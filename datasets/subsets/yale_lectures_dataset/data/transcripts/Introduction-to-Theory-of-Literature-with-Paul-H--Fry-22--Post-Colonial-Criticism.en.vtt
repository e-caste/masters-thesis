00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.768
Prof: Well,
post-colonial studies is really

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:10.861
by far the most varied and
eclectic of the identity fields

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:16.043
that we're passing in review in
this portion of the course:

00:00:16.043 --> 00:00:21.116
eclectic really of necessity,
of course, because of the

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:24.310
immense variety of the materials
covered,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.828
but also because of swirling
issues and controversies within

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:32.045
post-colonial studies or
"po-co,"

00:00:32.045 --> 00:00:38.272
as it's affectionately known,
which kind of pose a number of

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:44.310
questions from the side that
keep things lively,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.470
to say the least.
 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.861
We are taking up only one
strand, one developmental

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:54.287
strand,
in post-colonial studies today,

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:58.602
a kind of progression from the
work of Said to the work of

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:02.009
Bhabha which is relatively
easily mapped,

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:07.361
simply in terms of the
intellectual agendas of each of

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.775
them,
but there's a great deal else

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:10.328
going on.
 

00:01:10.328 --> 00:01:16.352
I suppose I should just mention
in passing certain topics that

00:01:16.352 --> 00:01:21.455
we won't be discussing,
at least except possibly in

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:25.340
passing and that,
however, you might really be

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.765
interested in considering if you
do have an interest in this

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:30.438
field.
 

00:01:30.438 --> 00:01:33.525
The first issue,
of course, is who says

00:01:33.525 --> 00:01:37.506
"post-colonial,"
and who says that we're

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:40.349
necessarily out of colonialism?
 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:44.250
Just because the local viceroy
packs up and goes home doesn't

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.150
necessarily mean that things
change all that significantly in

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.750
the so-called postcolonial
setting,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.360
and it needs to be taken into
account,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.086
seriously considered,
whether or not one isn't still

00:01:58.086 --> 00:02:02.813
in colonial or colonial studies
and that the moniker

00:02:02.813 --> 00:02:06.799
"post-colonial"
might therefore be

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.580
inappropriately applied.
 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.859
There's also the question that
arises in the study of the

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.831
so-called third world,
which is obviously in itself a

00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:19.590
controversial term.
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.590
It arises as that which is not
comprised as either of the great

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.590
sort of trajectories of the
superpowers during the Cold War.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.700
There is no Cold War,
at least allegedly no Cold War

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.577
any longer,
and so the question of the

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:39.599
status, nature,
and structure of the third

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.770
world is obviously wide open.
 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.428
But the issue I mean to touch
on in terms of post-colonial

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:50.168
studies is whether,
in fact, crises and concerns

00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:57.181
with respect to the third world
are necessarily always to be

00:02:57.181 --> 00:03:01.699
understood in terms of
coloniality.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:07.437
Is it just that certain parts
of the globe have been colonized

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:13.270
that constitutes them as they
are and shapes their identity?

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:19.252
Said in a very interesting way
takes this up in trying to

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:25.556
figure out how it is that German
Orientalism so very closely

00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:31.854
resembles French Orientalism,
even though the Germans had no

00:03:31.854 --> 00:03:35.318
colonial interests in the Middle
East.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:38.906
During the whole period--the
early nineteenth century in

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:41.780
particular,
when German Orientalism is

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.400
practically indistinguishable
from the French,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.878
takes up the same concerns,
and has the same interests--

00:03:47.878 --> 00:03:52.150
how is it that the French are
undoubtedly in some sense,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.504
in Said's view,
determined by their colonial

00:03:55.504 --> 00:03:57.908
interests,
and the Germans,

00:03:57.908 --> 00:04:01.990
who seem so much to reflect
French attitudes,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.949
have no colonial interests,
at least in the Middle East?

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:10.693
Said sort of quite honestly
tries to come to terms with

00:04:10.693 --> 00:04:11.180
this.
 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.453
His answer is,
"Well, German Orientalism

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:19.139
is simply derived in scholarly
terms from French Orientalism.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.324
It has the stamp of that
thinking and reflects that

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:24.810
thinking,"
and so there you are.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.089
He could have said on the other
hand,

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:32.389
however, that a certain mindset
toward the third world--

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.940
and this is the point I have
been making about this

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.002
particular issue--
dictates a certain way of

00:04:38.002 --> 00:04:41.680
structuring one's thought about
that world,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.101
irrespective of whether or not
there are colonial interests

00:04:46.101 --> 00:04:46.940
involved.
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.086
That's what I mean by raising
the question,

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:56.218
"Is coloniality always at
issue in cases of this

00:04:56.218 --> 00:04:57.699
kind?"
 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.350
There's a kind of confusion in
thinking about these things,

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.894
a confusion which is distilled
in the history of the British

00:05:06.894 --> 00:05:10.723
East India Company--
which is both nationalist and,

00:05:10.723 --> 00:05:14.973
as it were,
globalizing--but a confusion

00:05:14.973 --> 00:05:21.620
which comes out in more recent
history of coloniality,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.449
and that is:
well, what drives coloniality?

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.973
Is it always nationalism or,
as seems increasingly the case

00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:34.639
in the modern world,
is it transnational interests

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.639
in globalization?
 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.545
In other words,
is the relationship between the

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:44.959
colonist and the colonized a
relation of some sort of

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:50.139
metropolitan nation with respect
to a provincial empire,

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.778
or is it a relation which is
dictated and generated by the

00:05:54.778 --> 00:05:57.870
economic interests of
globalization?

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.935
This is a complex subject which
generates a great deal of debate

00:06:01.935 --> 00:06:04.389
in the field that we take up
today,

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.363
but in a way,
we can't just say,

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:11.677
"Well,
nationalism isn't important

00:06:11.677 --> 00:06:14.199
anymore,
now it's globalization"

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:18.329
because actually nationalism
seems to have reappeared in the

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.925
Bush foreign policy,
even possibly to be continued

00:06:21.925 --> 00:06:25.869
in the Obama foreign policy,
and so there's a complex

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:30.358
relationship still between
nationalism and globalization

00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:35.257
that needs to be considered and
thought about if these social

00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:38.850
relations are to be clearly
understood.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.769
Finally, there is within
post-colonial studies--

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:50.273
especially among those who
represent the various colonized

00:06:50.273 --> 00:06:54.809
interests of the world--
there is the question,

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:58.089
to borrow an expression from
Gayatri Spivak,

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:01.120
"How should the subaltern
speak?"

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.309
It has to do most vividly with
the very question,

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:10.459
"Which language should the
subaltern speak in?"

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.637
Spivak's own question is,
"Can the subaltern speak

00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:14.519
at all?"
 

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:17.896
and Said raises that question,
as you notice,

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.660
during the course of his
analysis;

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.511
but the related issue is,
okay, suppose that the

00:07:24.511 --> 00:07:28.281
subaltern can speak--suppose
Ngugi wa Thiong'o,

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:31.149
for example,
can write a novel.

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:34.639
What language should it be
written in?

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:40.815
Ngugi campaigned in his more
recent career not to write in

00:07:40.815 --> 00:07:46.992
English and also to urge other
African writers to write in

00:07:46.992 --> 00:07:53.709
native languages and not in the
language of the colonizer.

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:58.865
This is a frequently heard
opinion from within

00:07:58.865 --> 00:08:03.240
post-colonial studies,
but debate swirls around it

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.040
because,
of course, the means of

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:11.396
circulation of literary
influence is languages that draw

00:08:11.396 --> 00:08:17.240
upon international publishing
possibilities and not languages

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.499
that can only be grasped and
published and disseminated

00:08:22.499 --> 00:08:23.959
locally.
 

00:08:23.959 --> 00:08:28.216
So there, too,
you have a complicated issue or

00:08:28.216 --> 00:08:33.798
controversy on both sides,
of which there is much to say;

00:08:33.798 --> 00:08:36.942
but as I say,
for us today it's simply a

00:08:36.942 --> 00:08:39.549
question--
or more simply a question,

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.210
because when you've got Homi
Bhabha on the syllabus there's

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:48.232
no such thing as simplicity--
so I should say it's a question

00:08:48.232 --> 00:08:54.239
of following the trajectory or
development specifically between

00:08:54.239 --> 00:08:56.080
Said and Bhabha.
 

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.312
In beginning to think about
Said, I thought we wouldn't

00:08:59.312 --> 00:09:00.389
think about him.
 

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:02.839
We'd think instead,
for a moment at least,

00:09:02.839 --> 00:09:04.870
once again about Virginia
Woolf.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.820
In the second chapter of A
Room of One's Own,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.610
this young woman,
Mary Beton, Mary Seton,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.692
Mary Carmichael--whoever she
is, is sitting in the British

00:09:15.692 --> 00:09:16.408
Library.
 

00:09:16.408 --> 00:09:20.950
She's thought that she'd spend
the morning trying to figure out

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:23.440
what scholars think about women.
 

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.509
After all, the subject is women
and fiction.

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:30.765
I'm supposed to be addressing
these undergraduates on this

00:09:30.765 --> 00:09:33.279
subject: "what do I know
about women?

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:35.860
I'd better go to the library
and find out."

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:41.037
So she expects just to find a
couple of books and she'll be

00:09:41.037 --> 00:09:41.928
all set.
 

00:09:41.928 --> 00:09:46.226
Instead she is simply
overwhelmed, and there's this

00:09:46.226 --> 00:09:48.288
avalanche of material.
 

00:09:48.288 --> 00:09:52.837
She submits maybe a dozen or
two call slips and then sits

00:09:52.837 --> 00:09:56.250
back waiting for the material to
appear.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.823
Of course, the point of it is
that everything in the British

00:10:00.823 --> 00:10:05.630
Library on what turns out to be
the voluminous subject of women

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.879
is written by men,
right?

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:09.190
Everything.
 

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:14.596
She begins to take note of the
way these things are described

00:10:14.596 --> 00:10:18.110
in the sort of pre-computer
database.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.695
That is to say,
how do you classify the various

00:10:21.695 --> 00:10:24.970
things that men have to say
about women?

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.509
This is the way it goes:
"condition of Middle Ages

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.559
of;
habits in the Fiji Islands of;

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:38.649
worshipped as goddesses by;
weaker in moral sense than;

00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:43.840
idealism of;
greater conscientious of;

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.529
South Sea islanders age of

00:10:47.529 --> 00:10:53.259
attractiveness of;

00:10:53.259 --> 00:10:59.450
small size of brain of;
profounder sub-consciousness of;

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:05.003
less hair on the body of;

inferiority of;

greater length of life of;

strength of affections of;

higher education of;
Shakespeare's opinion of;

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.960
Lord Birkenhead's opinion of;
Dean Inge's opinion of;

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.309
La Bruyere's opinion of;
Dr. Johnson's opinion of;

00:11:27.309 --> 00:11:30.735
Mr. Oscar Browning's opinion of;
and dot, dot,

00:11:30.735 --> 00:11:33.399
dot--the list can continue.
 

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:35.480
In other words, she sits there.
 

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.304
She's simply overwhelmed,
and what she of course is

00:11:39.304 --> 00:11:43.894
telling us is that there's lots
and lots and lots and lots of

00:11:43.894 --> 00:11:49.548
opinions on record about women,
all of them expressed by men.

00:11:49.548 --> 00:11:52.408
So now thinking about Edward
Said,

00:11:52.408 --> 00:11:56.240
if Edward Said had taken up
Virginia Woolf's project,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:00.730
if Edward Said had undertaken
to write A Room of One's Own,

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.693
the title of it would have
been Female-ism,

00:12:03.693 --> 00:12:04.210
right?
 

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.986
That's precisely what he means
by "Orientalism,"

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:13.424
the vast body of information--
some of it scholarly,

00:12:13.424 --> 00:12:17.269
some of it just sort of sheerly
doxological--

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:21.200
the vast body of information
about peoples called

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.230
"Oriental"
by and large,

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.019
especially in the
nineteenth-century tradition.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:32.330
Said's main concern is the
peoples of the Middle East,

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.688
and he shows how it is that
there's a certain reason why

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:39.048
this is an appropriate term to
use for that tradition of

00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:42.470
scholarship and philology in the
nineteenth century.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:45.628
In any case,
the vast body of material

00:12:45.628 --> 00:12:50.899
published about these people--
and it's perfectly true that

00:12:50.899 --> 00:12:56.250
there are the infinitely long
shelves of the library devoted

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:00.149
to multivolume treatises on this
topic,

00:13:00.149 --> 00:13:03.580
all of them written by us in
the West--

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:10.418
us--about this other who is
perpetually in our imagination

00:13:10.418 --> 00:13:16.778
and constructed by us in the
variety of ways that Said

00:13:16.778 --> 00:13:22.850
discusses on page 1811,
the right-hand column.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.798
He says toward the bottom of
the column:

00:13:29.798 --> 00:13:33.590
Orientalism is premised upon
exteriority,

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.649
that is, on the fact that the
Orientalist,

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:40.379
poet or scholar,
makes the Orient speak,

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:45.498
describes the Orient,
renders its mysteries plain for

00:13:45.498 --> 00:13:47.269
and to the West.
 

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:51.422
Just as in Woolf,
men's opinions about women

00:13:51.422 --> 00:13:57.408
getting themselves expressed in
books make the subject of woman

00:13:57.408 --> 00:14:00.500
clear to an audience of men.
 

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.278
All right.
 

00:14:01.278 --> 00:14:09.638
So before moving in with some
more depth and precision into

00:14:09.638 --> 00:14:14.327
Said's text,
let me quickly explain what I

00:14:14.327 --> 00:14:19.123
mean by saying that Said and
Bhabha constitute a kind of

00:14:19.123 --> 00:14:20.168
sequence.
 

00:14:20.168 --> 00:14:24.990
I'm thinking in particular of
Elaine Showalter's distinction

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.750
between feminist and
gynocritical criticism.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.542
You remember the distinction
which is echoed,

00:14:31.542 --> 00:14:33.509
by the way, in Gates's essay.
 

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:37.011
The distinction is:
first you get criticism in

00:14:37.011 --> 00:14:41.759
which the treatment of women in
literature by men is the focus

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:45.611
of attention,
and then subsequently you get

00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:49.250
criticism in which the women's
tradition,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:54.418
the voice of women themselves,
is the focus and,

00:14:54.418 --> 00:14:58.378
as Showalter believes,
the more fruitful terrain for

00:14:58.378 --> 00:14:59.308
criticism.
 

00:14:59.308 --> 00:15:04.561
You can see that in that
context, by way of making that

00:15:04.561 --> 00:15:07.980
distinction,
you can see that Said is

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:13.173
decidedly phase one because,
of course, Orientalism is about

00:15:13.173 --> 00:15:18.038
the treatment of the Middle
Eastern other by the West.

00:15:18.038 --> 00:15:23.690
It can be slotted into that
same moment.

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:29.898
Then Homi Bhabha obviously in a
variety of ways takes up the

00:15:29.898 --> 00:15:35.580
subject position of the
colonized, of the subaltern.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.123
He doesn't leave out the
subject position of the

00:15:39.123 --> 00:15:44.100
colonizer because he sees them
as being radically interrelated,

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:48.448
but he plainly is as interested
in a variety of ways of talking

00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:52.378
about the traditions of the
colonized as he is of talking

00:15:52.378 --> 00:15:55.885
about the way in which
colonization takes place and

00:15:55.885 --> 00:15:57.500
expresses itself.
 

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.871
So in that sense,
we can see Said and Bhabha as

00:16:01.871 --> 00:16:07.100
belonging to these two phases as
mapped by Showalter.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:11.520
As I say also in passing by
Gates--and I'm sorry for the

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.460
confusion of this heading
[gestures to board]--

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.441
actually there's another way in
which Said and Bhabha can be

00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:22.139
understood as phase one and
phase two.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.839
That has much more to do with
the tradition of literary

00:16:26.839 --> 00:16:29.649
theory,
which in their ways both

00:16:29.649 --> 00:16:32.558
Showalter and Gates have
rejected,

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:37.677
insisting that one needs to
commandeer white male literary

00:16:37.677 --> 00:16:40.548
theory for one's own purposes.
 

00:16:40.548 --> 00:16:44.999
I suppose it's a question of
how this issue doesn't come up

00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.610
in Said and Bhabha.
 

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.601
It could perhaps be answered by
saying that precisely in the

00:16:51.601 --> 00:16:57.205
situation of colonialism,
the intellectuals--third world,

00:16:57.205 --> 00:17:03.658
colonized intellectuals--
nevertheless are educated in

00:17:03.658 --> 00:17:09.670
high-octane male metropolitan
institutions,

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:13.328
by which of course one means
primarily Oxford and Cambridge.

00:17:13.328 --> 00:17:18.009
In a certain sense,
they come to identify--

00:17:18.009 --> 00:17:23.657
and this is not actually a
thing apart from Bhabha's

00:17:23.657 --> 00:17:29.720
argument about hybridity--
they come to identify in some

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:35.336
measure with the educational
agenda of the colonizer and

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:37.480
participate in it.
 

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.660
Now that's speculative.
 

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:44.028
It may simply be that we have
missed out on those moments when

00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:47.605
Said and Bhabha,
too, may be talking about the

00:17:47.605 --> 00:17:51.220
way in which the white male
tradition of literary theory

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.248
needs to be appropriated;
but for the moment what I want

00:17:55.248 --> 00:17:58.894
to point out is this:
Said's Orientalism works very

00:17:58.894 --> 00:18:03.490
much in the historical moment of
what we call structuralism.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.011
That is to say,
it's primary concern is with

00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:12.666
the binary opposition,
a mutual and interdependent

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:20.148
binary opposition of central
self and decentralized other

00:18:20.148 --> 00:18:23.728
including,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:27.282
the way in which the
construction of the otherness of

00:18:27.282 --> 00:18:31.520
the other is actually covertly
also at the same time a means of

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:36.025
constructing,
defining, and delimiting the

00:18:36.025 --> 00:18:41.163
nature of selfhood,
or in this case of being

00:18:41.163 --> 00:18:42.190
Western.
 

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.269
There is a fundamental binarism
in Said's point of view,

00:18:46.269 --> 00:18:49.380
which by the way has often been
criticized,

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:55.845
and it's been criticized most
often from the standpoint of

00:18:55.845 --> 00:18:58.786
Bhabha--
if only because he's constantly

00:18:58.786 --> 00:19:01.000
referring to Derrida's famous
essay,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.788
"The Double Session,"
which is about Mallarmé,

00:19:03.788 --> 00:19:08.115
and also because he
appropriates a great deal of the

00:19:08.115 --> 00:19:10.828
language and style of Derrida.
 

00:19:10.828 --> 00:19:15.469
You can see that Bhabha takes,
with respect to the binarism of

00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:18.740
structuralism,
a deconstructive attitude.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.230
In other words,
his sense of these relations

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.702
breaks down into,
at the very least,

00:19:26.702 --> 00:19:30.313
a redoubling sense of what he
calls "double

00:19:30.313 --> 00:19:33.692
consciousness"
so that one can't clearly

00:19:33.692 --> 00:19:38.380
identify colonizer and colonized
as a binary opposition.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.242
It's more complicated than
that, and it's a series of

00:19:42.242 --> 00:19:46.404
issues that turns on a highly
Derridian sense of what one

00:19:46.404 --> 00:19:48.558
might mean by difference.
 

00:19:48.558 --> 00:19:53.325
All I want to say is that the
relation, Said-Bhabha,

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.808
is phase one-phase two in that
regard as well.

00:19:57.808 --> 00:20:03.592
By the way, this is a tendency
that one can find in other forms

00:20:03.592 --> 00:20:07.230
of theory having to do with
identity.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:11.513
The relationship between the
classical feminism that we have

00:20:11.513 --> 00:20:15.798
been discussing so far and the
gender theory that we will be

00:20:15.798 --> 00:20:19.423
discussing on Tuesday,
especially in the case of

00:20:19.423 --> 00:20:23.016
Judith Butler,
is once again a relation that

00:20:23.016 --> 00:20:27.111
could be understood as between
structuralism and

00:20:27.111 --> 00:20:28.680
deconstruction.
 

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.029
There, too, you have a not
completely overlapping but,

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:37.298
from the standpoint of our
concerns in literary theory,

00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:42.380
nevertheless rather interesting
way in which this succession,

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:46.183
Said-Bhabha,
is phase one-phase two in two

00:20:46.183 --> 00:20:49.990
different ways that can be
identified,

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.109
I think, usefully.
 

00:20:51.109 --> 00:20:52.000
All right.
 

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.829
So that then about their
relationship.

00:20:55.829 --> 00:20:58.509
So what about Said?
 

00:20:58.509 --> 00:21:03.806
How do we get at the issues
that Said wants to talk about

00:21:03.806 --> 00:21:09.858
and understand the way in which
he thinks they have integrity?

00:21:09.858 --> 00:21:13.816
I think I'd like actually to
begin with a word or two about

00:21:13.816 --> 00:21:18.624
truth,
because Said makes it clear

00:21:18.624 --> 00:21:24.655
that in a way,
the demonization of Orientalism

00:21:24.655 --> 00:21:31.290
that his project undertakes
isn't really undertaken because

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:36.440
Orientalism is necessarily a
pack of lies.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:41.248
Maybe he waffles a little bit
about this, but it's not really

00:21:41.248 --> 00:21:45.656
ultimately the point for him
whether Orientalism lies or

00:21:45.656 --> 00:21:47.259
tells the truth.
 

00:21:47.259 --> 00:21:51.476
This is the way he puts it on
page 1802 in the right-hand

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.127
column:
â€¦ [A]

00:21:53.127 --> 00:21:54.700
third qualification.
 

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.277
One ought never to assume that
the structure of Orientalism is

00:21:59.277 --> 00:22:03.480
nothing more than a structure of
lies or myths which,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.890
were the truth about them to be
told,

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.538
would simply blow away.
 

00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:10.835
I myself believe that
Orientalism is more particularly

00:22:10.835 --> 00:22:14.130
valuable as a sign of
European-Atlantic power over the

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:18.108
Orient than it is as a veridic
discourse about the Orient...

00:22:18.108 --> 00:22:21.146
Nevertheless,
what we must respect and try to

00:22:21.146 --> 00:22:24.321
grasp is the sheer
knitted-together strength of

00:22:24.321 --> 00:22:27.839
Orientalist discourseâ€¦
In other words,

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:31.976
one of Napoleon's adjutants
during Napoleon's campaign

00:22:31.976 --> 00:22:36.578
through Egypt wrote a ten-volume
Eastward de l'Egypt.

00:22:36.578 --> 00:22:41.717
Many of the texts which
Said mentions in passing in his

00:22:41.717 --> 00:22:45.880
introduction to Orientalism are
just as long.

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:51.280
You've got fifty-volume,
sort of gigantic scholarly

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.606
undertakings,
and you've got to admit,

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:57.068
well, if they are saying that
much,

00:22:57.068 --> 00:22:59.098
there's got to be something in
it that's true.

00:22:59.098 --> 00:23:03.009
There is, after all,
a great deal of knowledge of a

00:23:03.009 --> 00:23:05.864
certain kind,
at least, that has gone into

00:23:05.864 --> 00:23:09.045
thinking of this kind,
and so one can't just say,

00:23:09.045 --> 00:23:12.380
"My point is that none of
it's true."

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.808
Said is at pains to make a
distinction, therefore,

00:23:16.808 --> 00:23:19.160
between truth and value.
 

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:24.930
It's not that Orientalist
discourse is necessarily true or

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:25.740
false.
 

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:32.866
It is the case though that it
is insidiously devaluate of its

00:23:32.866 --> 00:23:37.945
object of attention--
that there is an implicit

00:23:37.945 --> 00:23:43.858
euro-centrism which Said does go
so far as to consider a form of

00:23:43.858 --> 00:23:48.344
racism in Orientalism,
quite irrespective of any

00:23:48.344 --> 00:23:51.858
measure or degree of truth that
what are,

00:23:51.858 --> 00:23:55.461
after all, the meticulous
researches of a lot of these

00:23:55.461 --> 00:23:56.890
characters turn up.
 

00:23:56.890 --> 00:24:00.247
For example,
on page 1812,

00:24:00.247 --> 00:24:04.680
the left-hand column,
he says:

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:08.688
My analysis of the Orientalist
text therefore places emphasis

00:24:08.688 --> 00:24:11.227
[this is about a third of the
way down]

00:24:11.227 --> 00:24:16.655
on the evidence,
which is by no means invisible,

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:23.538
for such representations as
representations,

00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:27.769
not as "natural"
descriptions of the Orient.

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:32.377
Now we might pause for a minute
over that as a possible object

00:24:32.377 --> 00:24:35.930
of critique because at the end
of his essay,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.058
or at the end of the
introduction as you have it,

00:24:38.058 --> 00:24:40.200
you notice Said saying,
"Look,

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.700
I don't take up here the
question of how one might

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.200
actually write correctly
&gt;

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:48.470
about these people."
 

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.567
He doesn't take up,
for example,

00:24:51.567 --> 00:24:56.765
the question of what it might
be like to be sort of a

00:24:56.765 --> 00:25:02.161
representative of these
minorities or colonized figures

00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:05.460
and to write about oneself.
 

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.602
He doesn't really take up the
question of whether the bias of

00:25:09.602 --> 00:25:13.920
somebody else writing about me,
a man writing about a woman,

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.439
is worse than the bias of my
own preconceptions and

00:25:17.439 --> 00:25:19.338
prejudices about myself.
 

00:25:19.338 --> 00:25:23.914
He admits that he doesn't
really have an advanced theory

00:25:23.914 --> 00:25:27.990
that secures one kind of
representation as true or

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:32.898
authentic and secures another
kind of representation as bias

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:34.730
and inauthentic.
 

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.140
He says, "Another scholar
will perhaps take this up.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.457
I leave it alone in my
book," and it is left

00:25:41.457 --> 00:25:45.057
alone,
the problem being that the

00:25:45.057 --> 00:25:50.586
claim remains that he does--
anticipating many other people

00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:53.160
who have written on this
subject--

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.862
he does impugn Orientalism as
mere representation:

00:25:57.862 --> 00:26:02.869
that is to say,
as the opposite because it is a

00:26:02.869 --> 00:26:07.800
representation,
the opposite of a natural

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.808
evocation of an ethos or world.
 

00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:15.951
So we just do want to put a
little question mark in the

00:26:15.951 --> 00:26:19.019
margin and then say,
"Well, fine.

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:21.928
Granted this is all
representation,

00:26:21.928 --> 00:26:23.640
where is the text?
 

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:27.078
Where could the text be that
would be natural?"

00:26:27.078 --> 00:26:29.366
Is there, for example,
any such thing,

00:26:29.366 --> 00:26:32.828
as we've asked ourselves over
the course of the semester,

00:26:32.828 --> 00:26:34.190
as a natural sign?
 

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.932
The sign being arbitrary,
it does place us already pretty

00:26:38.932 --> 00:26:42.490
securely in the realm of
representation.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:47.339
So all of these questions are
then posed by Said's sense of

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:52.107
the relationship between truth
and value in the history of

00:26:52.107 --> 00:26:54.450
Orientalist scholarship.
 

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.068
Now where is he coming from?
 

00:26:57.068 --> 00:27:02.674
He's quite open about it,
and it's perhaps worth pausing

00:27:02.674 --> 00:27:08.586
over an idea common to the two
scholar-theorists who matter

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:13.198
most to him,
Michel Foucault and the Italian

00:27:13.198 --> 00:27:15.519
Marxist Antonio Gramsci.
 

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:20.088
First of all,
just to pass in review the way

00:27:20.088 --> 00:27:24.978
in which he's indebted to
Gramsci on page 1803,

00:27:24.978 --> 00:27:28.910
the left-hand column,
Said says:

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:31.902
Culture, of course,
is to be found operating within

00:27:31.902 --> 00:27:34.990
civil society,
where the influence of ideas,

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.772
of institutions and of other
persons works not through

00:27:38.772 --> 00:27:42.200
domination but by what Gramsci
calls consent.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.246
In other words,
it's not just a question of

00:27:45.246 --> 00:27:49.453
having forced down your throat
certain ideas of concepts or

00:27:49.453 --> 00:27:51.659
laws,
for that matter,

00:27:51.659 --> 00:27:57.251
but a circulation of knowledge,
so called, of feeling about

00:27:57.251 --> 00:27:59.724
things,
of ideology,

00:27:59.724 --> 00:28:06.905
which through consent
establishes certain attitudes of

00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:07.990
bias.
 

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:13.349
This is the distinction that
Gramsci makes between the way in

00:28:13.349 --> 00:28:18.353
which one is imposed on by
actual power and authority and

00:28:18.353 --> 00:28:23.801
the way in which one is imposed
on by the circulations of what

00:28:23.801 --> 00:28:28.090
we've been exposed to in the
past as being called

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.950
"ideologemes."
 

00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:35.320
So to continue:
In any society not totalitarian

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.258
[says Said],
then, certain cultural forms

00:28:38.258 --> 00:28:42.047
predominate over others,
just as certain ideas are more

00:28:42.047 --> 00:28:45.894
influential than others;
the form of this cultural

00:28:45.894 --> 00:28:51.038
leadership is what Gramsci has
identified as hegemony.

00:28:51.038 --> 00:28:55.410
This is a term that you will
frequently encounter,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:59.660
particularly in Marxist
criticism, but it is also a term

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:04.297
very closely related to what for
most Western readers is more

00:29:04.297 --> 00:29:07.618
famous in the work of Michel
Foucault,

00:29:07.618 --> 00:29:10.000
the term "power"
or sometimes

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.880
"power/knowledge."
 

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.355
As you will learn in the
excerpt from Foucault that

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:20.119
you'll be reading on Tuesday,
Foucault like Gramsci makes a

00:29:20.119 --> 00:29:25.464
distinction between power merely
as that which is exercised by

00:29:25.464 --> 00:29:29.609
the police,
by the legal arm of society,

00:29:29.609 --> 00:29:33.670
by the dictator,
by the government,

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:40.032
and by power as the ways,
the frequently insidious ways,

00:29:40.032 --> 00:29:45.440
in which knowledge is
circulated and made hegemonic--

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.058
that is to say,
made authoritative.

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:55.912
Foucault is fascinated by the
structure of this circulation of

00:29:55.912 --> 00:29:57.259
knowledge.
 

00:29:57.259 --> 00:30:01.230
That is, in fact the essential
subject matter of all of his

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.140
late work,
the way in which we are

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:09.411
thinking that we are sort of
free contemplative agents in the

00:30:09.411 --> 00:30:12.027
world,
in fact browbeaten by

00:30:12.027 --> 00:30:16.330
structures of opinion
circulating around us that lull

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.380
us into feeling that we are in
the presence of the truth,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.296
whereas of course,
we're only in the presence of

00:30:25.296 --> 00:30:28.630
one form or another of motivated
bias.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:34.183
Both Gramsci and Foucault make
the distinction between absolute

00:30:34.183 --> 00:30:38.126
power and, as Gramsci calls it,
hegemony and,

00:30:38.126 --> 00:30:41.890
as Foucault calls it,
power/knowledge.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.848
Said is talking here about
power/knowledge.

00:30:45.848 --> 00:30:49.885
He's not talking about the
imposition of law through force

00:30:49.885 --> 00:30:52.858
or any other means on a
colonized world.

00:30:52.858 --> 00:30:58.385
He's talking about the way in
which opinions construct that

00:30:58.385 --> 00:31:03.721
world and simultaneously
reinforce the authority of those

00:31:03.721 --> 00:31:06.578
who generate the opinions.
 

00:31:06.578 --> 00:31:10.657
I think it's important to point
this relatively subtle

00:31:10.657 --> 00:31:13.196
distinction out:
he does, however,

00:31:13.196 --> 00:31:16.430
disagree from Foucault in one
respect.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:20.919
On page 1813 he goes back to
what we already know about

00:31:20.919 --> 00:31:25.907
Foucault, which is Foucault's
interest in the author function

00:31:25.907 --> 00:31:28.318
as opposed to the author.
 

00:31:28.318 --> 00:31:33.238
Authors, generally speaking,
Foucault wants to say,

00:31:33.238 --> 00:31:39.240
are not authorities but simply
vessels of forms of opinion.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:44.002
Certain authors who come very
close to being authority we call

00:31:44.002 --> 00:31:48.136
founders of discursivity,
but even in their cases it's

00:31:48.136 --> 00:31:52.378
the nature of the discourse and
not their existence as authors

00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:53.910
which is important.
 

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.162
Said wants to say,
"I take authors a little

00:31:57.162 --> 00:32:00.898
bit more seriously than
that," and he does on page

00:32:00.898 --> 00:32:04.288
1813 in the right-hand column
where he says:

00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:08.417
Foucault believes that in
general the individual text or

00:32:08.417 --> 00:32:13.094
author counts for very little;
empirically [that is to say,

00:32:13.094 --> 00:32:16.098
"through my
experience"],

00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:20.820
in the case of Orientalism,
and perhaps nowhere else I find

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.450
this not to be so.
 

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:24.544
In other words,
the author is the central

00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:27.308
philologist,
and social historians,

00:32:27.308 --> 00:32:32.798
explorers, and demographers who
have written so extensively on

00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:36.578
this part of the world are
authorities.

00:32:36.578 --> 00:32:42.212
They are the oracles from which
generalized and ultimately

00:32:42.212 --> 00:32:47.548
commonplace opinions disseminate
as power/knowledge.

00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:51.079
It's not a question,
therefore, of a kind of silent

00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:55.104
drumbeat of opinion expressing
itself over and over again,

00:32:55.104 --> 00:32:58.068
which is more what interests
Foucault.

00:32:58.068 --> 00:33:02.386
So Said, as I say,
distinguishes himself subtly

00:33:02.386 --> 00:33:07.738
from Foucault in that regard
while nevertheless confessing

00:33:07.738 --> 00:33:13.182
openly the influence both of
Foucault and of Gramsci on his

00:33:13.182 --> 00:33:16.750
way of approaching his material.
 

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:24.202
So as a circulation of power,
the effect of Orientalism is

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:30.480
something that ultimately
concerns Said.Well,

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:32.891
he says this somewhat
rhetorically because it

00:33:32.891 --> 00:33:36.288
obviously does concern him that
it has an effect on the peoples

00:33:36.288 --> 00:33:39.548
in question,
but what ultimately concerns

00:33:39.548 --> 00:33:43.871
Said is the effect of
Orientalism on the Euro-centric

00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:46.792
mind,
indeed the degree to which it

00:33:46.792 --> 00:33:50.838
even can be said to construct
the Euro-centric mind,

00:33:50.838 --> 00:33:54.180
page 1806, the right-hand
column:

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:00.548
â€¦ [M]y real argument is
that Orientalism is--

00:34:00.548 --> 00:34:03.512
and does not simply
represent--a considerable

00:34:03.512 --> 00:34:07.150
dimension of modern
political-intellectual culture,

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:11.827
and as such has less to do with
the Orient than it does with

00:34:11.827 --> 00:34:13.730
"our"
world.

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.954
Now here you can see the degree
to which Said is saying

00:34:17.954 --> 00:34:23.039
something very similar to what
Toni Morrison said in her essay.

00:34:23.039 --> 00:34:29.900
The existence of black as
absence needs to be understood--

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:32.036
for example,
if we are studying the history

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:35.501
of American literature--
as the means of constructing

00:34:35.501 --> 00:34:39.021
whiteness,
of that which liberates

00:34:39.021 --> 00:34:45.699
whiteness from the forms of
constraint under which it's been

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:48.190
chafing at the bit.
 

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.340
Morrison, of course,
develops this argument

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.503
beautifully,
and she quite clearly takes it

00:34:53.503 --> 00:34:58.132
from the fourth chapter of
Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind

00:34:58.132 --> 00:35:02.920
as a way of understanding
the master-slave dialectic.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.545
In other words,
in Hegel it's clear as Hegel

00:35:06.545 --> 00:35:11.016
develops the idea that master
and slave are absolutely

00:35:11.016 --> 00:35:15.739
necessary to each other in a
structure of mutuality.

00:35:15.739 --> 00:35:19.661
The master isn't the master,
can't define himself as free or

00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:22.719
superior without the existence
of the slave.

00:35:22.719 --> 00:35:27.313
The trickiness that the slave
learns being in the position of

00:35:27.313 --> 00:35:31.449
subordination involving the
development of all sorts of

00:35:31.449 --> 00:35:35.201
complicated skills means
ultimately that the slave

00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:38.963
becomes,
as it were, that which drives

00:35:38.963 --> 00:35:44.373
the master technologically and
ultimately controls the master

00:35:44.373 --> 00:35:48.070
in a kind of fable of class
reversal,

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.782
which continues to reverse
itself again and again and again

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:54.489
on various grounds.
 

00:35:54.489 --> 00:35:59.282
This is the fable,
which at the same time is a

00:35:59.282 --> 00:36:05.143
philosophy of class relations
that structures Morrison's

00:36:05.143 --> 00:36:11.619
argument and which,
I think, also structures Said's.

00:36:11.619 --> 00:36:16.456
I want to make the transition
to Bhabha because obviously this

00:36:16.456 --> 00:36:18.360
is a form of binarism.
 

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:24.164
The two signifiers in relation
to each other need each other in

00:36:24.164 --> 00:36:29.873
the way that we described when
we were discussing Saussure and

00:36:29.873 --> 00:36:31.559
structuralism.
 

00:36:31.559 --> 00:36:36.909
I can't simply say that a red
light has positive value.

00:36:36.909 --> 00:36:41.166
You remember the whole
argument: I have to see the red

00:36:41.166 --> 00:36:45.505
light in the context of the
semiotic system to which it

00:36:45.505 --> 00:36:46.469
belongs.
 

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:49.806
I have to see it as being
different from,

00:36:49.806 --> 00:36:53.144
or opposed to,
something else in order to

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:54.230
grasp it.
 

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.000
I cannot know it positively,
in other words;

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.550
I can only know it negatively.
 

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.197
This basic concept of
structuralism in the Saussurian

00:37:04.197 --> 00:37:09.293
tradition is what creates,
is what shapes binary arguments

00:37:09.293 --> 00:37:12.780
of the kind that one finds in
Said.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:18.465
That we know ourselves
negatively as the not-other is

00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:23.371
the basic principle,
the theoretical principle which

00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:28.079
underlies obviously aspects of
the argument which are also,

00:37:28.079 --> 00:37:29.989
as Said says, empirical.
 

00:37:29.989 --> 00:37:32.454
Yes, I can say it's a
structuralist idea,

00:37:32.454 --> 00:37:36.150
but I really believe it because
I've seen it in operation.

00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:38.909
It's not just structuralism in
other words.

00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:42.568
It shares, however,
with structuralism a

00:37:42.568 --> 00:37:45.289
theoretical predisposition.
 

00:37:45.289 --> 00:37:51.547
Bhabha, if you look at page
1879, openly criticizes the

00:37:51.547 --> 00:37:55.719
premise of binarism of this
kind--

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:59.190
not just any binarism,
but he actually does go

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.119
directly back to Hegel.
 

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:03.813
In other words,
he identifies the source of

00:38:03.813 --> 00:38:06.186
thinking of this kind,
bottom of 1879,

00:38:06.186 --> 00:38:08.559
right-hand column,
when he says:

00:38:08.559 --> 00:38:12.864
It is this ambivalence that
makes the boundaries of colonial

00:38:12.864 --> 00:38:17.153
"positionality"--
the division of self/other--and

00:38:17.153 --> 00:38:21.434
the question of colonial power--
the differentiation of

00:38:21.434 --> 00:38:24.652
colonizer/colonized--
different from both the

00:38:24.652 --> 00:38:27.597
Hegelian master/slave dialectic
or the phenomenological

00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:29.070
projection of Otherness.
 

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:31.300
He goes on to mention other
things,

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:36.818
but I just want to focus on
this as a moment in which Bhabha

00:38:36.818 --> 00:38:41.869
is distinguishing himself as
clearly as he can from the

00:38:41.869 --> 00:38:43.739
project of Said.
 

00:38:43.739 --> 00:38:46.990
Now the passage I just read
begins with the word

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:48.789
"ambivalence."
 

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:52.760
What does Bhabha mean by
ambivalence?

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:57.771
Let's try to start there and
see if we can work our way into

00:38:57.771 --> 00:39:01.340
Bhabha's complex thinking on
these matters,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:05.250
first by way of the notion of
ambivalence.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:09.630
I'm going to put this in terms
of an historical example because

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.739
I hope that will make it a
little clearer.

00:39:12.739 --> 00:39:18.699
There is the ambivalence of the
colonizer toward the colonized.

00:39:18.699 --> 00:39:21.561
In other words,
it's not just one mindset that

00:39:21.561 --> 00:39:22.960
drives colonization.
 

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:28.751
In the historical experience of
England in the East India

00:39:28.751 --> 00:39:32.141
Company,
there are two distinct phases,

00:39:32.141 --> 00:39:36.268
phases which actually repeat
themselves recurrently even

00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:38.969
throughout the twentieth
century.

00:39:38.969 --> 00:39:43.090
The first in the eighteenth
century is the period of the

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:47.436
government of the East India
Company by Warren Hastings who

00:39:47.436 --> 00:39:51.032
in a certain sense was
interested in what we call

00:39:51.032 --> 00:39:55.077
"going native"
and also encouraged all of his

00:39:55.077 --> 00:39:58.750
provincial administrators to do
likewise.

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:03.706
Hastings, in other words,
in Saidian terms knew a great

00:40:03.706 --> 00:40:07.010
deal about the Orientalized
other.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.920
He knew all the local languages
and dialects.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:11.380
He knew all the customs.
 

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:17.181
He really knew everything there
was to know and in a certain

00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:22.885
sense was a person who did go
native while at the same time

00:40:22.885 --> 00:40:28.096
wielding with an iron grip of
authority power over the

00:40:28.096 --> 00:40:30.260
colonized other.
 

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.492
He himself then embodies a
certain ambivalence in not

00:40:34.492 --> 00:40:39.050
giving an inch as to the actual
control of authority,

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:44.219
while at the same time seeming
to become one with the other.

00:40:44.219 --> 00:40:47.706
Then there is the historical
ambivalence which expresses

00:40:47.706 --> 00:40:50.559
itself in a completely different
attitude,

00:40:50.559 --> 00:40:57.485
an attitude which surfaced in
the East India Company early in

00:40:57.485 --> 00:41:05.219
the nineteenth century under the
supervisorship of Charles Grant.

00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:08.965
There had been a tremendous
revival of fundamentalist

00:41:08.965 --> 00:41:11.402
religion,
mainly Methodism,

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:15.932
in England, and this
evangelical enthusiasm spread

00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:19.909
itself into the interests of the
empire.

00:41:19.909 --> 00:41:25.471
Charles Grant and others like
him no longer had any interest

00:41:25.471 --> 00:41:29.523
at all in going native but,
on the contrary,

00:41:29.523 --> 00:41:33.039
insisted that a standard of
Englishness and,

00:41:33.039 --> 00:41:36.106
in particular,
the standard of the English

00:41:36.106 --> 00:41:38.684
Bible--
the coming of the English book

00:41:38.684 --> 00:41:42.239
that Bhabha talks about at the
beginning of his essay--

00:41:42.239 --> 00:41:46.391
be firmly implanted,
and that the imposition of

00:41:46.391 --> 00:41:50.905
Englishness on the colonized
other be the agenda of

00:41:50.905 --> 00:41:52.440
colonization.
 

00:41:52.440 --> 00:42:00.067
The famous historian Thomas
Babington Macaulay codified this

00:42:00.067 --> 00:42:05.079
attitude in a famous,
and soon to be infamous,

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:08.503
document he wrote called
"The Minute on

00:42:08.503 --> 00:42:11.608
Education,"
which insisted that the

00:42:11.608 --> 00:42:16.226
education of the Indian people
under the regime of the East

00:42:16.226 --> 00:42:20.605
India Company be conducted
strictly according to English

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:25.302
models: that missionaries no
longer try to adapt their ideas

00:42:25.302 --> 00:42:30.159
to local customs and folk ways
but that everything be strictly

00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:32.070
anglicized.
 

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:36.693
This is a completely different
attitude toward colonization,

00:42:36.693 --> 00:42:41.630
and it can be understood as a
sort of historical ambivalence.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:46.864
I'd actually like to pause over
an example of what you might

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:52.228
call the Warren Hastings moment,
a vicious example although an

00:42:52.228 --> 00:42:56.746
absolutely fascinating one in
the disturbing masterpiece by

00:42:56.746 --> 00:42:59.630
John Ford called The
Searchers.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.550
I hope some of you at least
know that film.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:12.059
The John Wayne character is
sort of a lone stranger--

00:43:12.059 --> 00:43:15.230
which is of course not
infrequent in the western--

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:20.376
who shows up at the house of
some relatives and hears that a

00:43:20.376 --> 00:43:24.391
daughter has been abducted by
native Americans,

00:43:24.391 --> 00:43:25.699
by Indians.
 

00:43:25.699 --> 00:43:30.277
Now the thing about John Wayne
is that in this film is that

00:43:30.277 --> 00:43:34.976
he's a vicious racist,
that he absolutely hates the

00:43:34.976 --> 00:43:38.550
Indians,
but he is not a vicious racist

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.500
from the standpoint of
ignorance.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.139
He is in fact a person who has
himself, in a certain sense,

00:43:46.139 --> 00:43:47.260
gone native.
 

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.590
He knows all the Indian
languages and dialects.

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:52.949
He knows all their customs.
 

00:43:52.949 --> 00:43:59.065
He has throughout a lifetime
made a careful study of the

00:43:59.065 --> 00:44:03.655
people he hates,
and this is a volatile mixture

00:44:03.655 --> 00:44:07.780
to be exposed to in a film
because we are much more

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:12.811
comfortable with the idea that
hatred arises out of ignorance,

00:44:12.811 --> 00:44:13.719
right?
 

00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:19.101
What is so deeply disturbing
about John Ford's The

00:44:19.101 --> 00:44:25.208
Searchers is that it is a
portrait of absolutely vicious

00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:29.871
racism: again Said says,
"Hey, it's not necessarily

00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:33.050
truth,
but we do have to acknowledge a

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.650
certain local,
thick description.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.601
We have to acknowledge that
there's quite a bit of

00:44:38.601 --> 00:44:40.768
information
&gt;

00:44:40.768 --> 00:44:45.318
at this person's disposal,
and all of that is borne out in

00:44:45.318 --> 00:44:49.309
the characterization of John
Wayne in this film.

00:44:49.309 --> 00:44:51.389
Warren Hastings was a lot like
that.

00:44:51.389 --> 00:44:56.920
Warren Hastings knew everything
about people whom he ultimately

00:44:56.920 --> 00:45:02.271
didn't really respect and whom
he insisted on ruling with the

00:45:02.271 --> 00:45:04.679
iron fist of authority.
 

00:45:04.679 --> 00:45:08.994
That's the kind of thing that
Bhabha is thinking about when he

00:45:08.994 --> 00:45:12.460
thinks about the ambivalence of
the colonizer,

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.168
the relationship between
knowledge and value as it's

00:45:16.168 --> 00:45:20.679
already been enunciated in Said
but also the fact that there is

00:45:20.679 --> 00:45:23.880
more than one mindset for the
colonizer.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.369
There is the local knowledge
mindset,

00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:32.628
and there is the sort of
raising the absolute unequivocal

00:45:32.628 --> 00:45:38.552
standard of the colonizer that
these are two different

00:45:38.552 --> 00:45:42.378
attitudes,
each of which dictate different

00:45:42.378 --> 00:45:45.141
strategies,
particularly strategies of

00:45:45.141 --> 00:45:45.929
education.
 

00:45:45.929 --> 00:45:50.510
So that's the ambivalence of
the colonizer.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.804
Then there is the ambivalence
of the colonized,

00:45:54.804 --> 00:45:58.447
and that, too,
has to be understood as a

00:45:58.447 --> 00:46:01.809
complex relation to co-optation.
 

00:46:01.809 --> 00:46:05.474
The anecdote with which Bhabha
begins, I think,

00:46:05.474 --> 00:46:09.059
is fascinating and well worth
attending to.

00:46:09.059 --> 00:46:14.768
You have not a colonizer but
someone thoroughly co-opted,

00:46:14.768 --> 00:46:23.442
an evangelical converted
Christian of Indian descent who

00:46:23.442 --> 00:46:27.721
represents,
in a way, that the people he

00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:32.235
finds sitting under the trees
reading the Bible consider to be

00:46:32.235 --> 00:46:36.822
completely authentic because he
believes and is perfectly happy

00:46:36.822 --> 00:46:40.722
to believe that the Bible,
and for that matter

00:46:40.722 --> 00:46:45.300
Christianity itself,
is an English gift.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.246
But he's met with the response
of people who resist that,

00:46:49.246 --> 00:46:52.630
who say, "This is very
interesting stuff.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:56.079
We wish we could have some
local authority for it.

00:46:56.079 --> 00:47:00.375
Our understanding is we got
this book directly from God,

00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:01.000
right?
 

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.940
That's our understanding and we
have our own attitude toward it.

00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:07.402
Sure, maybe we'll get baptized
one of these days,

00:47:07.402 --> 00:47:10.326
but in the meantime we got to
go home and take care of the

00:47:10.326 --> 00:47:12.429
harvest, so we'll get around to
that.

00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:13.550
Don't worry about it.
 

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:17.871
By the way, if we get baptized
we certainly can't take the

00:47:17.871 --> 00:47:20.829
Eucharist because that's eating
meat.

00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:22.000
We don't eat meat.
 

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.900
We are who we are."
 

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:30.804
You can see that these
cunningly insinuated provisos to

00:47:30.804 --> 00:47:36.525
the attitude that the missionary
wants to inculcate in them in a

00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:41.250
very real way completely
undermines his purpose.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.510
They don't think of it as the
English Bible.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.880
They won't accept it as the
English Bible.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:50.610
They will only accept it as an
authority that's mediated by

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:54.690
their own values,
which transforms the document.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:59.099
You can see it again--this
is1813, as Bhabha points out.

00:47:59.099 --> 00:48:02.780
This is precisely at the moment
when we're moving,

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:07.577
when the regime of authority is
moving from the Warren Hastings

00:48:07.577 --> 00:48:10.750
paradigm to the Charles Grant
paradigm.

00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:15.784
It's no longer possible to
think in terms of adapting the

00:48:15.784 --> 00:48:19.650
Bible to local beliefs and
circumstances.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:24.137
This is a moment in which the
complexity of the attitude of

00:48:24.137 --> 00:48:26.460
the colonized is brought up.
 

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:30.099
There's the attitude of the
suborned missionary,

00:48:30.099 --> 00:48:33.447
and there's the more
complicated and interesting

00:48:33.447 --> 00:48:37.367
attitude of the people he
encounters sitting under these

00:48:37.367 --> 00:48:38.079
trees.
 

00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:55.050
Turn to page 1881,
the left-hand column.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:57.800
This is a very difficult
passage.

00:48:57.800 --> 00:49:00.309
Everything in Bhabha is
difficult.

00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:05.505
I think I want to gloss it by
suggesting to you that what he's

00:49:05.505 --> 00:49:09.510
talking about is that the
ambivalence which--

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:13.722
and we might as well say right
out that he has a term for this

00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:16.130
ambivalence,
and it's "hybridity"--

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:21.561
is the double consciousness of
the colonized hovering between

00:49:21.561 --> 00:49:23.869
submission--
that is to say,

00:49:23.869 --> 00:49:27.199
submission to authority but
with a difference,

00:49:27.199 --> 00:49:30.179
submission to authority on
one's own terms,

00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:35.043
and on the other hand,
acquiescence in authority as

00:49:35.043 --> 00:49:37.628
given,
which of course is basically

00:49:37.628 --> 00:49:39.579
the position of the missionary.
 

00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:43.248
With that said,
I'll read the passage in which

00:49:43.248 --> 00:49:48.221
Bhabha describes this hybridity
in the double consciousness of

00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:51.244
the colonized:
The place of difference and

00:49:51.244 --> 00:49:53.101
otherness,
or the space of the

00:49:53.101 --> 00:49:56.643
adversarial, within such a
system of "disposal"

00:49:56.643 --> 00:50:00.016
as I have proposed,
is never entirely on the

00:50:00.016 --> 00:50:02.889
outside or implacably
oppositional.

00:50:02.889 --> 00:50:06.496
[Not just, in other words,
again as a question of us

00:50:06.496 --> 00:50:08.900
versus them.]
It is a pressure,

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:11.510
and a presence,
that acts constantly,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.483
if unevenly,
along the entire boundary of

00:50:14.483 --> 00:50:17.679
authorization [which is also
authority],

00:50:17.679 --> 00:50:22.159
that is, on the surface between
what I've called

00:50:22.159 --> 00:50:27.500
disposal-as-bestowal [I take
that meaning submission--

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:31.134
simply "okay,
fine, I give in"]

00:50:31.134 --> 00:50:36.039
and disposition-as-inclination
[which is "hey,

00:50:36.039 --> 00:50:38.070
I kind of like that,
I go along with it,

00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:40.329
I give in spontaneously"].
 

00:50:40.329 --> 00:50:45.233
Now to give in simply as a form
of recognizing that one's

00:50:45.233 --> 00:50:48.391
beaten,
as a form of submission,

00:50:48.391 --> 00:50:53.527
puts one in the position of
what Bhabha calls "sly

00:50:53.527 --> 00:50:55.239
civility."
 

00:50:55.239 --> 00:51:00.083
This is the position that I'd
like to go back to for a moment

00:51:00.083 --> 00:51:05.170
as being very closely related to
what Gates calls signifyin'.

00:51:05.170 --> 00:51:09.237
Bhabha gives a number of
examples of this sly civility in

00:51:09.237 --> 00:51:12.411
his text,
but of course it's all present

00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:16.864
in the clever and wonderfully
rich ironies of these figures

00:51:16.864 --> 00:51:20.780
sitting under the trees in his
opening anecdote.

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:26.561
Let me just give you an example
of how sly civility works as a

00:51:26.561 --> 00:51:32.440
form of signifyin' and as a
stance of colonized resistance,

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.969
a recuperation of the will,
perhaps in a post-modern sense,

00:51:36.969 --> 00:51:40.380
which is nevertheless not
rebellious,

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:46.070
not in any way envisioning an
overthrow of authority,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:50.239
but is a means of living in the
framework of authority.

00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:53.800
Just a quick example and then
I'll let you go.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:57.630
Two African-American people are
having a conversation in the

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:02.612
presence of a white person,
and they cheerfully and with

00:52:02.612 --> 00:52:09.327
broad smiles on their face refer
to this person in his presence

00:52:09.327 --> 00:52:10.518
as Bill.
 

00:52:10.518 --> 00:52:14.800
Now "Bill"
is a derisive and derogatory

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.197
term for white people,
and the white person standing

00:52:19.197 --> 00:52:23.007
there has two choices in
response to hearing himself

00:52:23.007 --> 00:52:27.641
referred to as "Bill":
he can either take umbrage and

00:52:27.641 --> 00:52:29.639
say,
"Why are you saying that

00:52:29.639 --> 00:52:30.070
about me?
 

00:52:30.070 --> 00:52:31.170
I'm a nice guy.
 

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:36.038
You don't want to say
that," in which case the

00:52:36.038 --> 00:52:40.420
needling effect of the term has
taken hold;

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.121
or he can play the fool and
pretend that he doesn't know

00:52:45.121 --> 00:52:49.309
that he's being signified on and
pretend that,

00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:51.739
well, it's perfectly okay to be
called "Bill."

00:52:51.739 --> 00:52:56.050
Either way you see it's a
win/win situation.

00:52:56.050 --> 00:53:00.016
This guy, Bill,
is the slave owner,

00:53:00.016 --> 00:53:00.949
right?
 

00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:03.000
He likes to get along with
people,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.331
so he's sitting around having
this conversation and he hears

00:53:06.331 --> 00:53:08.195
them calling him
"Bill,"

00:53:08.195 --> 00:53:08.760
right?
 

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:13.527
Because there is an element of
good nature in his slave-owning

00:53:13.527 --> 00:53:15.559
personality, he's stuck.
 

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:19.284
He can either complain that
people are treating him

00:53:19.284 --> 00:53:22.695
unfairly--
which of course is neither here

00:53:22.695 --> 00:53:27.239
nor there in terms of the
structure of power involved--

00:53:27.239 --> 00:53:31.824
or he can play the fool and
pretend that he doesn't even

00:53:31.824 --> 00:53:34.909
notice that he's being made fun
of.

00:53:34.909 --> 00:53:40.695
Either way, this is an example
of that sly civility which

00:53:40.695 --> 00:53:46.791
signifies on the man and which
makes it clear that while the

00:53:46.791 --> 00:53:52.679
structure of power can't be
overthrown anytime soon,

00:53:52.679 --> 00:53:56.190
there nevertheless is a way of
living--

00:53:56.190 --> 00:54:01.092
at least of keeping one's sense
of humor within the existing

00:54:01.092 --> 00:54:05.407
structure of power--
while giving the man a hard

00:54:05.407 --> 00:54:05.960
time.
 

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:11.842
That is the set of attitudes
that Bhabha is articulating in

00:54:11.842 --> 00:54:16.710
his notion of the hybridity of
the colonized,

00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:20.050
which takes the form in
performance--

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:23.972
we're going to have a lot more
to say about performance on

00:54:23.972 --> 00:54:27.487
Tuesday--
in performance of this sly

00:54:27.487 --> 00:54:28.550
civility.
 

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:32.230
I think it's on page 1889 that
he gives us that expression,

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:33.869
which I think you should keep
hold of--

00:54:33.869 --> 00:54:36.954
which I would compare very
closely with what Henry Louis

00:54:36.954 --> 00:54:39.030
Gates calls
"signifyin'."

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.090
Okay.
 

00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:41.070
See you on Tuesday.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.268
Prof: The chronological
and geographical structure of

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:12.810
Luke-Acts is thematic and
theological, not historical.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.280
That's what we talked about
last time.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.029
How you can actually see the
author of Luke-Acts taking

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.050
sources that he took before him,
perhaps some oral sources,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.660
I've argued that some of these
were even written sources,

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.173
because it seems like you can
actually see where he takes

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:31.642
something that was in a written
account of the spread of

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:34.175
Christianity,
slices it at one place,

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:37.594
separates that,
and puts several chapters in

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:39.050
Acts between them.
 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.650
It's very clear from the ten
chapters in the Gospel of Luke,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.770
which we call the journey to
Jerusalem section,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.496
that this is an artificial
construction on the author's

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:54.462
part because,
he tells us at one point,

00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:58.410
at this point Jesus set his
face to go to Jerusalem.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.408
And then he's taken material
that he's found in the Gospel of

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:03.744
Mark in different places,
some parables here,

00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:05.650
some stories here,
some teachings here,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.140
he's taken other things that he
probably found in Q,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.896
in different places,
although because remember we

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:13.709
don't possess an actual written
document of Q,

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:18.200
it's a hypothetical document,
but we figure that if he did

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.099
this with Mark,
whose document we do possess

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:24.272
and therefore can see how he
changes the order of material he

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:27.665
presents from Mark,
he probably did the same thing

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:28.610
with Q also.
 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.935
We can see that he's taken
things from different sources

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:35.623
that he had and put them into
this ten chapter long journey to

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:36.470
Jerusalem.
 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.482
Luke and Acts looks like a
historical document and this is

00:01:40.482 --> 00:01:41.890
what fools people.
 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.900
Do you remember back earlier in
the beginning of the semester

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.063
where we compared the first two
chapters of Paul's letter to the

00:01:48.063 --> 00:01:51.176
Galatians with the way Paul is
presented as being in and out of

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:53.379
Jerusalem,
and how many times he went to

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.128
Jerusalem,
what happened in Jerusalem,

00:01:55.128 --> 00:01:57.682
what happened in Damascus,
and I asked you to compare

00:01:57.682 --> 00:01:58.700
those two accounts.
 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.816
Some of you thought,
well I believe the Acts account

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:05.239
because Paul clearly has an ax
to grind in Galatians,

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:08.103
he's clearly trying to make a
point of his independence from

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:09.218
the Jerusalem church.
 

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:12.199
The book of Acts just looks
more like a history;

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.128
it looks more like a historical
account.

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:16.965
Well by now you know that,
yes, even though it looks like

00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:19.489
a historical account,
especially by ancient

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.095
historiographical standards,
it's not a historical account

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:25.188
in anything like the modern
sense.

00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:27.949
One of the most important
things to realize,

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.280
these texts you're reading are
creative texts,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.619
they're put together for
purposes, not one of them is

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.830
coming to you without some kind
of ax to grind,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.456
without some kind of tendency,
without some kind of

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:43.400
theological or ethical or
political statement to make.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.383
I would go further,
well I just think I'm an honest

00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:51.188
realist,
some people might call me a

00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:54.924
cynic, and say that we need to
be careful about all texts we

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.849
read and not take any text that
we read as not having some kind

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.485
of slant,
some kind of interest,

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:04.090
some kind of ideological
message.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.580
That's important to read about
all texts in my view.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.726
The last time I made this point
by pointing out how that we can

00:03:11.726 --> 00:03:14.878
see some seams in Luke's
narrative,

00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:18.409
where he ripped apart the
source he used to splice

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.580
something between Acts 8:4 and
Acts 11:19.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.661
Now I want you to look with me
at another passage in Acts,

00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:27.960
we're going to do the same sort
of thing with Acts 6 and 7.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.009
Get your Bibles out.
 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:33.530
This is the story of Stephen.
 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.280
We've talked about Stephen
several times already,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.860
he's supposedly the first
Christian martyr.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.095
He was one of the Greek
speaking Hellenistic Jews who's

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.930
in Jerusalem at the time after
Jesus' death and resurrection,

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.220
and he is chosen as one of the
twelve [correction:

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.716
seven]
deacons to minister to the

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:52.240
widows and to do other kinds of
ministerial work,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.120
probably because the church was
made up partly of Aramaic-Hebrew

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.199
speaking Jews and partly of
Greek speaking Jews.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:02.491
Stephen seems to have been one
of those who was chosen to kind

00:04:02.491 --> 00:04:05.513
of take care of the Greek
speaking Jewish members of this

00:04:05.513 --> 00:04:06.968
small little community.
 

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:09.198
Now you have to remember we're
talking about a very early

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:10.789
period in the history of
Christianity.

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:12.669
It's not even Christianity yet.
 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.260
This is just a bunch of Jews
who believe Jesus is the

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.483
Messiah;
they were shocked and horrified

00:04:17.483 --> 00:04:20.988
when Jesus was crucified because
the Messiah was not supposed to

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:21.879
be crucified.
 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.817
There was no Jewish expectation
that the Messiah would be a

00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:27.250
suffering Messiah in the ancient
Jewish world.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.295
That's something that followers
of Jesus had to invent once they

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:33.100
were shocked at the fact that he
was actually crucified.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.502
The idea was the Messiah
wouldn't be crucified and

00:04:35.502 --> 00:04:37.807
wouldn't suffer,
the Messiah would bring an army

00:04:37.807 --> 00:04:39.230
and overthrow the Romans.
 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.668
So the fact that they believed
he was the Messiah and then he's

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.663
executed, that just came as a
huge shock to these early

00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:46.940
disciples of Jesus.
 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.920
They basically had to invent a
new concept of what the Jewish

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.850
Messiah was.
 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.050
This was a very small group of
people,

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.129
huddled in Jerusalem,
maybe some of them were in

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.661
Galilee,
maybe in Syria,

00:04:58.661 --> 00:05:01.911
maybe a few other places but
according to Acts they're all in

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:03.319
Jerusalem at this time.
 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.632
This small group of people are
trying to figure out who Jesus

00:05:06.632 --> 00:05:09.670
was and what that means for the
history of Jerusalem.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.038
Stephen is one of these people
and he's accused of several

00:05:13.038 --> 00:05:13.569
things.
 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:20.273
Look at 6:11,6:11 in Acts,
"They secretly instigated

00:05:20.273 --> 00:05:22.466
some men--
" that is,

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:25.139
they that the Jewish opponents
of this Jesus group,

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:30.350
they had become offended with
Stephen and his arguments."

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.838
They secretly instigated some
men to say, "We have heard

00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.209
him speak blasphemous words
against Moses and God."

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.199
They're accusing him of
blasphemy against Moses and God.

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.367
What would this kind of
blasphemy against Moses and God

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:43.649
mean?
 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:45.399
Well we're going to pick up a
few details.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:48.375
Look at 13:
They set up false witnesses who

00:05:48.375 --> 00:05:52.077
said, "This man never
stopped saying things against

00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:53.759
this holy place."
 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:56.930
What is this holy place?
 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.497
The temple, exactly,
"this holy place"

00:05:59.497 --> 00:06:01.300
refers to the Jerusalem temple.
 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.175
They're accusing him of
preaching against the temple and

00:06:05.175 --> 00:06:05.879
the law.
 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.865
"For we have heard him say
that this Jesus of Nazareth will

00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:11.605
destroy this place,
and will change the customs

00:06:11.605 --> 00:06:13.680
that Moses handed onto us."
 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.778
Now notice, the writer here is
telling you these are

00:06:17.778 --> 00:06:19.949
false accusations.
 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.720
Are they false accusations?
 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.350
Was he really preaching against
the temple?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.377
Remember, Jesus is portrayed in
some of the Gospels as

00:06:30.377 --> 00:06:33.519
himself having predicted
that the temple would be

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.319
destroyed.
 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:39.810
Does that mean that Jesus was
preaching against the temple?

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.954
Some Christian writers very
quickly portray Jesus as

00:06:42.954 --> 00:06:46.406
teaching that his followers
don't have to keep the Jewish

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:46.899
law.
 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.170
I don't think that's actually
correct for the historical Jesus

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.329
as we'll talk about when we get
to the historical Jesus.

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:54.391
That's clearly how some early
Christian writers are portraying

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:56.903
Jesus as teaching that,
you followers of mine don't

00:06:56.903 --> 00:06:58.509
have to keep the Jewish law.
 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:00.879
That's what they're accusing
Stephen of doing.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.511
So is this a false accusation
or is this just maybe what

00:07:04.511 --> 00:07:08.341
Stephen actually was teaching,
as being a different form of

00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:10.189
the message about Jesus?
 

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:13.932
Notice then we get to--these
are the accusations about

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:18.240
Stephen, but then in chapter 7
we get Stephen's own speech.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.990
Now this is very interesting.
 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.745
I wish I could read the whole
thing because it's rhetorically

00:07:22.745 --> 00:07:23.480
very powerful.
 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.680
What Stephen does is he starts
off just talking about the God

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.550
who appeared to Abraham in
Mesopotamia.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:34.089
He tells the story that any of
us Christians would recognize as

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:37.456
the story of the Old Testament
God and his interactions with

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:40.370
Abraham and Moses,
and which Jews would recognize

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.240
as reflected in Jewish
scripture,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.060
in Jewish tradition.
 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.980
That's the way the most part of
the first half of that chapter 7

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.589
goes, it's a retelling of the
Hebrew Bible story about God,

00:07:50.589 --> 00:07:51.959
the God of Israel.
 

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:55.690
What really becomes interesting
is, though, when he gets

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.490
to--around verse 37 in chapter
7, I mean 35 in chapter 7,

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.389
so look at that with me.
 

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:04.110
Now right before this,
notice he says:

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:06.617
"'I have surely seen the
mistreatment of my people [this

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:08.329
is God talking]
who were in Egypt and have

00:08:08.329 --> 00:08:10.879
heard their groaning and I have
come down to rescue them.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.860
Come now I will send you to
Egypt.'"

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.379
God's telling Moses,
at this point,

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:16.884
he's going to send them to
Egypt to deliver the people and

00:08:16.884 --> 00:08:19.519
we expect the whole story then
of the Exodus to come next.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:20.790
What does it say in verse 35?
 

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.704
"It was this Moses whom
they rejected when they said,

00:08:24.704 --> 00:08:26.970
'Who made you ruler and judge?'
 

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:30.598
and whom God now sent as both
ruler and liberator through the

00:08:30.598 --> 00:08:33.379
angel who appeared to him in the
bush."

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.013
In other words,
instead of emphasizing here

00:08:36.013 --> 00:08:39.899
Moses' activity of leading the
Israelites out of captivity,

00:08:39.899 --> 00:08:42.971
he emphasizes another aspect of
the story that's there in the

00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:46.014
Old Testament story because,
yes, one of the Israelites--the

00:08:46.014 --> 00:08:48.830
story is: Moses comes upon two
Israelites who are fighting.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.292
They're both--they are slaves
in Egypt at this time and he

00:08:51.292 --> 00:08:53.841
says to one of the Israelites,
is that any way to treat your

00:08:53.841 --> 00:08:54.360
brother?
 

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:58.681
That Israelite rebukes him and
says, who set you up as a judge

00:08:58.681 --> 00:08:59.389
over us?
 

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:03.520
Notice that's the verse that
Stephen centers on at this point

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.070
to emphasize the story about
Moses.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:10.413
Not so much Moses as just
deliverer but Moses as someone

00:09:10.413 --> 00:09:12.389
rejected by the people.
 

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:13.870
Have we seen that before?
 

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.708
Uh-huh, one of the themes of
Luke-Acts is prophets get

00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:19.519
rejected by the people.
 

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:22.179
Verse 35, that's what he
emphasizes.

00:09:22.179 --> 00:09:23.428
Let's just keep reading there.
 

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:25.871
"He led them out,
having performed wonders and

00:09:25.871 --> 00:09:28.851
signs in Egypt at the Red Sea,
and in the wilderness for forty

00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:29.340
years.
 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.793
This is the Moses who said to
the Israelites,

00:09:31.793 --> 00:09:34.971
'God will raise up a prophet
for you from your own people,

00:09:34.971 --> 00:09:38.976
as he raised me up.'"
Now in the Old Testament it

00:09:38.976 --> 00:09:43.110
seems like Moses is talking
about--anybody know?

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.909
Who follows Moses as the leader
of the people of Israel?

00:09:47.909 --> 00:09:48.279
Yes sir?
 

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:48.720
Student:  Joshua.
 

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.548
Prof: Joshua, exactly.
 

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:54.043
It sounds like Moses is
predicting Joshua's being raised

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:56.841
up after he dies,
but that's not what Stephen

00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:57.539
thinks.
 

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:03.923
"This is the Moses who
said to the Israelites,

00:10:03.923 --> 00:10:06.480
'God will raise you ...'"
"He is the one who was in

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.135
the congregation in the
wilderness with the angel who

00:10:09.135 --> 00:10:11.690
spoke to him at Mount Sinai with
our ancestors;

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.558
he received living oracles to
give to us.

00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:16.308
Our ancestors were unwilling to
obey him;

00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:18.942
instead they pushed him aside
in their hearts and turned back

00:10:18.942 --> 00:10:19.690
to Egypt."
 

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:23.692
Then it tells about the golden
calf story, how the Israelites

00:10:23.692 --> 00:10:27.428
rejected Moses and the law,
and made a golden fat calf to

00:10:27.428 --> 00:10:28.230
worship.
 

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.828
Now look at 7:44:
"Our ancestors had the

00:10:31.828 --> 00:10:34.460
tent of testimony in the
wilderness,

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:36.690
as God directed when he spoke
to Moses,

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.874
ordering him to make it
according to the pattern he had

00:10:38.874 --> 00:10:39.399
seen."
 

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:42.452
This refers to the stories in
Exodus about the tabernacle,

00:10:42.452 --> 00:10:44.379
"the tent of
testimony."

00:10:44.379 --> 00:10:47.732
This is a big tent that's--the
construction that we just talked

00:10:47.732 --> 00:10:49.773
about,
this is where God would meet

00:10:49.773 --> 00:10:52.715
the people Israel and Moses
before the building of the

00:10:52.715 --> 00:10:53.269
temple.
 

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:55.889
Stephen is fine with this,
he's saying,

00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:59.410
God instructed Moses,
and Moses directed the people

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.283
to construct this tent of
witness or meeting of God with

00:11:03.283 --> 00:11:06.051
Israel,
and that's where God chose to

00:11:06.051 --> 00:11:08.899
be with his people according to
the Bible.

00:11:08.899 --> 00:11:10.750
He gives that little history.
 

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.921
But then look at 45,
"Our ancestors in turn

00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.750
brought it in with Joshua when
they dispossessed the nations

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:20.538
that God drove out before our
ancestors.

00:11:20.538 --> 00:11:23.538
And it was there until the time
of David ..."

00:11:23.538 --> 00:11:26.856
So up until the time of David
the people of Israel had a

00:11:26.856 --> 00:11:29.269
tabernacle where they met
God."..

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:32.187
.who found favor with God and
asked that he might find a

00:11:32.187 --> 00:11:34.629
dwelling place for the house of
Jacob."

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:38.394
David was the first one who
raised the idea of having a

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:40.892
temple to God,
not just a tabernacle but a

00:11:40.892 --> 00:11:42.410
temple,
that's where we're going in the

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.899
history here.
 

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:45.620
"But it was Solomon who
built the house for him.

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.874
Yet the Most High does not
dwell in houses made with human

00:11:49.874 --> 00:11:50.919
hands."
 

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:53.678
Where does the story go?
 

00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:55.798
The story's gone fine up to
this point.

00:11:55.798 --> 00:11:59.376
It's just like we see it in
Exodus and the Old Testament,

00:11:59.376 --> 00:12:02.379
the Hebrew Bible,
David wanted to build a temple

00:12:02.379 --> 00:12:04.038
for God, God said,
no.

00:12:04.038 --> 00:12:06.674
Solomon comes up later and he
wants to build temple and

00:12:06.674 --> 00:12:09.115
finally God says yes,
at least according to part of

00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:10.139
the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:12:10.139 --> 00:12:13.697
But another part of the Hebrew
Bible always had a little bit of

00:12:13.697 --> 00:12:17.140
a prejudice against the idea
that anybody could build a house

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.830
for God.
 

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.379
Some prophets seem not to like
the temple so much,

00:12:21.379 --> 00:12:24.928
other prophets seem to like the
temple so much.

00:12:24.928 --> 00:12:28.740
What Stephen is doing,
he's pulling out of the Hebrew

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.480
Bible that kind of anti-temple
prophetic strain,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.899
and he's emphasizing that as
part of his message.

00:12:35.899 --> 00:12:38.831
Then notice what he quotes
there, a passage from the Hebrew

00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:43.850
Bible, and then in verse 51:
"You stiff necked people,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.628
uncircumcised of heart and
ears, you are forever opposing

00:12:48.628 --> 00:12:52.657
the Holy Spirit,
just as your ancestors used to

00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:53.460
do."
 

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.038
What happened to Stephen?
 

00:12:56.038 --> 00:13:00.561
He just went--all of a sudden
his panties are really in a wad

00:13:00.561 --> 00:13:02.370
for no obvious reason.
 

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.230
He's been telling the story of
the building of the temple.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.480
He's been going along fine,
now he starts--he's gone from

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.918
preaching now to insulting his
audience.

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:13.379
He's insulting the Jews in
Jerusalem;

00:13:13.379 --> 00:13:15.720
he's accusing them of being on
the wrong side of history.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.720
Why?
 

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.509
Because they wanted to build a
temple.

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:22.590
"Which of the prophets did
your ancestors not persecute?

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.779
They killed those who foretold
the coming of the Righteous One,

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:28.558
and now you have become his
betrayers and murderers.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.178
You are the ones who received
the law as ordained by

00:13:31.178 --> 00:13:31.950
angels."
 

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.759
What?
 

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:38.279
Angels gave the Jewish law?
 

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:43.320
I thought God gave the law,
the Torah, on Sinai.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.868
I thought God wrote the stones
with his finger and gave them to

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.730
Moses, and Moses carried them
down the mountain.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.070
Well, yeah, that's what the
scripture says,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.849
but by this time in Jewish
history it was not uncommon for

00:13:57.849 --> 00:13:59.722
Jews,
even pious Jews,

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:04.009
to believe that God did not
himself directly write the law

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:07.639
and give it to Moses,
angels did.

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:10.772
Most of them believed that this
was with God's pleasure and

00:14:10.772 --> 00:14:11.418
principle.
 

00:14:11.418 --> 00:14:15.601
God wanted the angels to
deliver the law through Jews,

00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:19.072
but at least they put,
between God and Moses,

00:14:19.072 --> 00:14:19.940
angels.
 

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.328
And angels, according to some
of these traditions,

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:25.402
were the ones who actually gave
the law to the Israelites and to

00:14:25.402 --> 00:14:25.889
Moses.
 

00:14:25.889 --> 00:14:29.605
As we'll come to see,
Paul believed this also,

00:14:29.605 --> 00:14:32.908
it wasn't an uncommon view
among Jews.

00:14:32.908 --> 00:14:37.873
But notice what Stephen does,
he actually uses this tradition

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:42.589
that the angels were the ones
who gave the law to Moses to

00:14:42.589 --> 00:14:47.527
distance God a bit from the law,
to make the law a little bit

00:14:47.527 --> 00:14:49.070
less connected to God.
 

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:54.590
He demotes the law by reading
the angels in between them.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.279
Stephen has done two things in
this speech.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:02.413
He's grabbed hold of a certain
prophetic tradition that we know

00:15:02.413 --> 00:15:06.416
is already there in the Bible,
which criticized the Jerusalem

00:15:06.416 --> 00:15:07.149
temple.
 

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:10.850
It's there in some prophets,
why should God need a house?

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:13.759
God doesn't need a house,
God lives everywhere.

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:17.129
Stephen pulls on that tradition
that's already in the Bible,

00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:19.058
and then he adds this tradition
about--

00:15:19.058 --> 00:15:22.548
that was common at the time
about angels being the ones who

00:15:22.548 --> 00:15:26.038
actually gave the law to Moses
rather than God directly.

00:15:26.038 --> 00:15:29.210
Then he turns all this on his
Jewish attackers,

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.736
his critics,
and that's what he accuses them

00:15:31.736 --> 00:15:32.900
of,
and then says,

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:36.260
you crucified Jesus just like
the people rejected Moses and

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:37.418
all the prophets.
 

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:40.419
When they heard these things
they became enraged and ground

00:15:40.419 --> 00:15:42.798
their teeth at Stephen,
and they stoned him.

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:45.580
Is it any surprise they stoned
him?

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.085
Now I ask the question again,
when the author of Acts sets

00:15:50.085 --> 00:15:54.195
these things up as false
accusations against Stephen,

00:15:54.195 --> 00:15:55.460
who's right?
 

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.139
Stephen or the author?
 

00:15:57.139 --> 00:16:01.274
Stephen actually does look
like, in his own speech,

00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:05.080
to be attacking both the law
and the temple.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.808
That is "this holy
place" and Moses.

00:16:09.808 --> 00:16:13.947
I think what's going on here is
another place we see the author

00:16:13.947 --> 00:16:16.950
of Acts taking material he has
before him,

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.950
and sticking it into a place,
and then writing around it.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.883
For example,
the author of Acts is the one

00:16:22.883 --> 00:16:25.123
who says,
these were false accusations

00:16:25.123 --> 00:16:27.058
against Stephen,
they set up and they were

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:29.485
totally false,
Stephen was totally innocent,

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:33.370
but then he actually includes
Stephen's speech which backs up

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:34.600
the accusations.
 

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.936
The other thing that makes this
seem to me clearly that the

00:16:37.936 --> 00:16:41.446
author is using prior material
is that this view of the temple

00:16:41.446 --> 00:16:44.730
that Stephen presents,
this view that the temple is

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.591
not good,
that God doesn't like the

00:16:46.591 --> 00:16:49.144
temple, and it's only stiff
necked and uncircumcised of

00:16:49.144 --> 00:16:51.129
heart people who believe in the
temple.

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:53.840
That's not the view of the
author of Acts.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.918
How do you know that?
 

00:16:55.918 --> 00:17:00.142
Because over and over again
Luke, the author of Acts,

00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:05.096
actually portrays the disciples
as meeting in the temple right

00:17:05.096 --> 00:17:10.278
after the resurrection of Jesus;
where does it say they met and

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:13.140
had prayers and preached,
and prayed?

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:16.118
In the temple,
the disciples of Jesus meet in

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:17.000
the temple.
 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.190
They're not anti-temple.
 

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:22.176
When Paul goes off around the
world, and then he comes back to

00:17:22.176 --> 00:17:25.250
Jerusalem, what does he do to
show his piety?

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.954
He takes a vow,
a Nazarite vow,

00:17:27.954 --> 00:17:32.019
he shaves his head,
he donates money which goes to

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:35.865
the temple for sacrifices,
and he himself goes to the

00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:37.259
temple to worship.
 

00:17:37.259 --> 00:17:40.618
Paul worships in the temple.
 

00:17:40.618 --> 00:17:44.558
The author of Acts is not
himself anti-temple.

00:17:44.558 --> 00:17:47.838
He believes that the Jerusalem
temple is just fine for Jews.

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:50.104
He actually doesn't think
Gentiles need to pay that much

00:17:50.104 --> 00:17:51.998
attention to it,
but he believes it's perfectly

00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:52.740
fine for Jews.
 

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:57.616
But he includes in here a
speech by Stephen that is both

00:17:57.616 --> 00:18:00.808
anti-temple and somewhat
anti-law.

00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:05.546
This shows that this author is
using these different sources

00:18:05.546 --> 00:18:10.521
the speech of Stephen comes from
a pre-Lukan source and its set

00:18:10.521 --> 00:18:12.608
into the book of Acts.
 

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:16.036
Now that means we can see his
editorial activity,

00:18:16.036 --> 00:18:19.318
but notice what it also tells
us we can see.

00:18:19.318 --> 00:18:22.980
We actually have,
then, two different forms of

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.690
early Christianity.
 

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.794
Luke represents one and Stephen
even embedded within Luke's own

00:18:28.794 --> 00:18:30.778
document represents another.
 

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:34.673
We've got two different ideas,
is the law of Moses something

00:18:34.673 --> 00:18:38.368
that's given by angels and
therefore demoted and not very

00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.452
good,
in which the law of Moses gets

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.528
criticized,
or is the law of Moses

00:18:42.528 --> 00:18:43.588
perfectly fine?
 

00:18:43.588 --> 00:18:47.952
The Jewish law with--that
signals their ethnicity as being

00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:51.320
people of Israel,
that's the point of view of

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:52.009
Luke.
 

00:18:52.009 --> 00:18:54.680
Is the temple something that is
good,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.690
that's a sign of God's covenant
with Israel,

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.173
which seems to be the view of
most of the people in Luke-Acts

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:04.717
or is the temple something that
shows that you're stiff necked

00:19:04.717 --> 00:19:06.750
if you believe in its efficacy?
 

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.098
That seems to be Stephen's view.
 

00:19:08.098 --> 00:19:10.525
In other words,
we have little hints here that

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:13.651
even within one book in the New
Testament we have different

00:19:13.651 --> 00:19:16.453
kinds of early Christianity
represented with slightly

00:19:16.453 --> 00:19:17.910
different theologies.
 

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:23.434
Now we can also see it several
other times where Luke takes and

00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:24.950
changes things.
 

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.730
I talked about this at the very
last of my session last time,

00:19:27.730 --> 00:19:29.910
but I want to just reiterate it
very quickly.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:31.884
Some of you,
if you don't have

00:19:31.884 --> 00:19:35.434
Throckmorton's Gospel parallels,
or some other Gospel parallels,

00:19:35.434 --> 00:19:36.788
this is why these are very
useful,

00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:39.026
because I'm going to use this
that way I have Mark right here

00:19:39.026 --> 00:19:41.336
and Luke right here for the same
passage and I can compare them

00:19:41.336 --> 00:19:42.626
very,
very directly,

00:19:42.626 --> 00:19:45.509
see exactly what words they
have different.

00:19:45.509 --> 00:19:55.490
If you don't have that put one
of your fingers where we talked

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.400
about last time,
Mark 13:14-27,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:07.598
and put another finger at Luke
21:20-33.

00:20:07.598 --> 00:20:12.762
And if you have Throckmorton
it's paragraph 216,

00:20:12.762 --> 00:20:16.059
section 216 in Throckmorton.
 

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:29.548
Look at the Mark passage first,
3:14:

00:20:29.548 --> 00:20:32.203
"But when you see the
desolating sacrilege set up

00:20:32.203 --> 00:20:35.410
where it ought not to be (let
the reader understand) ..."

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.923
And then he says,
get out of town,

00:20:37.923 --> 00:20:39.368
get out of Judea.
 

00:20:39.368 --> 00:20:42.147
Go to the mountains because all
hell is breaking loose anytime,

00:20:42.147 --> 00:20:44.390
and then he gives several
things that are there.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.601
If you look at Luke where Luke
has a parallel in Luke 21:20,

00:20:48.601 --> 00:20:52.384
Luke doesn't say "the
desolating sacrilege,"

00:20:52.384 --> 00:20:55.372
he just says,
"When you see Jerusalem

00:20:55.372 --> 00:20:58.411
surrounded by armies,
then know that its desolation

00:20:58.411 --> 00:20:59.808
has come near."
 

00:20:59.808 --> 00:21:03.359
There's a common wording there
but it's slightly different.

00:21:03.359 --> 00:21:06.032
Then Luke also says:
"Those inside this city

00:21:06.032 --> 00:21:07.611
should leave,
those out in the country should

00:21:07.611 --> 00:21:08.400
not enter it."
 

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.308
And then you go on.
 

00:21:09.308 --> 00:21:11.349
There's great distress in both
places.

00:21:11.349 --> 00:21:15.476
Look at verse 21 of Mark 13:
"If anyone says to you at

00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:16.720
this time, 'Look,
here's the Messiah!'

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.319
or 'Look, there he is!' do not
believe it."

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:18.900
False prophets.
 

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.314
Now that's also going to be in
Luke but in a totally different

00:21:22.314 --> 00:21:24.328
place that's contained in Luke
17.

00:21:24.328 --> 00:21:27.144
So Luke's using that false
prophet material but not in this

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:27.630
context.
 

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:34.105
Then look at Mark 13:24:
"But in those days after

00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:35.815
that suffering,
the sun will be dark and the

00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:37.698
moon will not give its light,
the stars will be falling from

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:38.150
heaven."
 

00:21:38.150 --> 00:21:40.382
In other words,
after all this other stuff he's

00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:43.098
told you, that's when the big
catastrophe takes place.

00:21:43.098 --> 00:21:45.683
The sun eclipses,
the stars fall from heaven,

00:21:45.683 --> 00:21:46.798
the moon is dark.
 

00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:50.279
Luke also has something like
that in Luke 21:25,

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.318
"There will be signs in
the sun,

00:21:51.318 --> 00:21:53.510
the moon, and the stars,
and on earth distress among

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.660
nations caused by the roaring of
the seas."

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.849
Luke gives slightly different
material.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:10.588
The problem is Luke then--yes,
notice how right after that it

00:22:10.588 --> 00:22:15.990
says--Mark has the Son of Man
coming with the clouds of glory

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.430
in verse 26.
 

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.269
Right after that you have the
Son of Man coming down,

00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:24.098
but Luke has a bunch more
material and you don't get

00:22:24.098 --> 00:22:27.930
anything until you see Luke
21:32 where he says,

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.019
"This generation will not
pass away until all things have

00:22:30.019 --> 00:22:30.500
taken place.
 

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.130
Heaven and earth will pass away
but my words will not pass

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.730
away."
 

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.690
Then where does--well,
I must have passed it.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:44.910
Where is it that Luke talks
about the time of the Gentiles?

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:50.029
Give me the verse--24?
 

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:56.140
Yes, that's right.
 

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.991
In 24:
"There will be great

00:22:58.991 --> 00:23:01.759
distress on earth and wrath,
they will fall by the edge of

00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:04.240
the sword and be taken away as
captive among all nations.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.281
And Jerusalem will be trampled
on by the Gentiles until the

00:23:07.281 --> 00:23:09.798
time of the Gentiles has been
fulfilled."

00:23:09.798 --> 00:23:12.996
Notice Luke inserts there
something that's not there in

00:23:12.996 --> 00:23:15.509
the other sources,
which is that Jerusalem will be

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:17.827
captured,
it will be destroyed,

00:23:17.827 --> 00:23:22.098
it will have a time of the
Gentiles in between.

00:23:22.098 --> 00:23:26.700
And then Luke goes on to talk
about the coming of Jesus and

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:27.890
the very end.
 

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:32.156
Again, one of these places
where you can clearly see the

00:23:32.156 --> 00:23:36.580
editorial seams of the writer
and you have the time of the

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.588
Gentiles.
 

00:23:37.588 --> 00:23:40.864
One of the things that we've
seen is that Luke is carefully

00:23:40.864 --> 00:23:43.630
constructing his sources to make
his own point.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:45.777
What I want to do now is now
turn our attention to,

00:23:45.777 --> 00:23:47.410
okay, what are some of those
points?

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.368
What are some of the points
we've already talked about?

00:23:49.368 --> 00:23:51.960
What are some of Luke's basic
messages?

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:57.269
One, Jesus is like the prophets;
Jesus is like Elijah and Elisha.

00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:01.019
Two, prophets get rejected by
their people.

00:24:01.019 --> 00:24:05.164
Three, when you're rejected by
the people then the message goes

00:24:05.164 --> 00:24:07.640
out to other corners of the
earth,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.872
and then this schematic view of
history that we talked about

00:24:11.872 --> 00:24:17.571
later from Jerusalem to Judea,
to Samaria, to the ends of the

00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:18.348
earth.
 

00:24:18.348 --> 00:24:20.490
Now let's look at how some of
these things play out.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:25.376
One of Luke's most important
messages is "to the Jew

00:24:25.376 --> 00:24:26.598
first."
 

00:24:26.598 --> 00:24:30.002
Let's look at Luke 1:5-7,
we're going to spend a little

00:24:30.002 --> 00:24:33.470
bit of time in Luke now,
the beginning parts of Luke.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.700
Luke is very concerned to show,
as I said last time,

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.320
that Jesus is a good Jewish
boy, his parents are good Jewish

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.006
parents,
he comes from good Jewish

00:24:46.006 --> 00:24:47.118
extended family.
 

00:24:47.118 --> 00:24:49.833
Luke 1:5, this is right after
the very beginning of the

00:24:49.833 --> 00:24:52.696
prologue which I mentioned
last--which I talked about last

00:24:52.696 --> 00:24:53.150
time.
 

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.140
In the days of King Herod of
Judea there was a priest named

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.078
Zachariah who belonged to the
priestly order of Abijah.

00:24:59.078 --> 00:25:01.354
His wife was a descendant of
Aaron, and her name was

00:25:01.354 --> 00:25:01.890
Elizabeth.
 

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:04.234
Both of them were righteous
before God, living blamelessly

00:25:04.234 --> 00:25:06.334
according to all the
commandments and regulations of

00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:06.868
the Lord.
 

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:09.055
But they had no children
because Elizabeth was barren,

00:25:09.055 --> 00:25:10.538
and both were getting on in
years.

00:25:10.538 --> 00:25:15.990
Doesn't that sound kind of
familiar?

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:19.740
Old, very righteous couple,
can't have children,

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.818
she's getting on in years,
she's barren,

00:25:25.818 --> 00:25:30.118
Abraham and Sarah,
sounds like lots of--

00:25:30.118 --> 00:25:32.567
it sounds like Abraham and
Sarah, it also is going to sound

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:34.858
like Hannah,
the mother of Samuel.

00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:38.002
These are these wonderful
stories in the Bible about this

00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:40.809
old couple who want to have
children and can't have

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:41.538
children.
 

00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:45.354
So this is already evoking this
idea of Jesus' family being like

00:25:45.354 --> 00:25:47.051
a story--
they're a family like--you

00:25:47.051 --> 00:25:48.759
might find them right there in
scripture,

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.490
they're just like that.
 

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.741
Look at 1:25,
this is when Elizabeth

00:25:52.741 --> 00:25:56.088
conceives, for five months she
remained in seclusion,

00:25:56.088 --> 00:25:58.343
she said,
"This is what the Lord has

00:25:58.343 --> 00:26:00.744
done for me when he looked
favorably on me and took away

00:26:00.744 --> 00:26:03.058
the disgrace I have endured
among my people."

00:26:03.058 --> 00:26:08.200
Sounds like its right out of 1
Samuel, second chapter.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:14.515
Look--keep one finger right
there--in fact first read

00:26:14.515 --> 00:26:18.279
1:46--this is the Magnificat.
 

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:22.729
Look at 1:46, Mary said:
"My soul magnifies the

00:26:22.729 --> 00:26:25.338
Lord, my spirit rejoices in God
my Savior.

00:26:25.338 --> 00:26:27.868
For he has looked with favor on
the lowliness of his servant.

00:26:27.868 --> 00:26:29.657
Surely from now on all
generations will call me

00:26:29.657 --> 00:26:30.278
blessed."
 

00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:32.991
I read this last time,
there's a lot of message about

00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:34.868
the rich will be sent to go
away,

00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:37.836
the poor will be raised up,
the reversal of status in the

00:26:37.836 --> 00:26:38.259
world.
 

00:26:38.259 --> 00:26:41.593
Now keep your finger there and
go all the way to the Old

00:26:41.593 --> 00:26:44.200
Testament, the Hebrew Bible,
to 1 Samuel.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.553
It's right before the two books
called Kings and right after the

00:26:50.553 --> 00:26:52.470
book called Ruth.
 

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:57.994
1 Samuel tells about the birth
of the prophet Samuel,

00:26:57.994 --> 00:27:03.520
his mother is Hannah,
and here's her story in chapter

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.817
2 of 1 Samuel,
Hannah prayed and said,

00:27:06.817 --> 00:27:08.818
"My heart exalts in the
Lord,

00:27:08.818 --> 00:27:12.094
my strength is exalted in my
God, my mouth derides my enemies

00:27:12.094 --> 00:27:13.950
because I rejoice in my victory.
 

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.630
There is no Holy One like the
Lord, no one beside you;

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.078
there is no rock like our God.
 

00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:20.462
Talk no more so proudly,
let not arrogance come from

00:27:20.462 --> 00:27:22.614
your mouth, for the Lord is a
God of knowledge,

00:27:22.614 --> 00:27:24.250
and by him actions are weighed.
 

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:27.663
The bows of the mighty are
broken, but the feeble gird on

00:27:27.663 --> 00:27:28.700
strength."
 

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.898
It's a whole song,
you can read the whole thing

00:27:30.898 --> 00:27:32.978
there,
but if you just keep one finger

00:27:32.978 --> 00:27:37.144
at 1 Samuel 2,
and one finger at Luke 1:46,

00:27:37.144 --> 00:27:44.009
Mary's song is obviously
fashioned on the song of Hannah.

00:27:44.009 --> 00:27:48.257
The message is the reversal of
status of rich and poor,

00:27:48.257 --> 00:27:49.829
weak and powerful.
 

00:27:49.829 --> 00:27:50.960
That's not all.
 

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:56.630
Look at 1:14.
 

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.949
This is talking about the birth
of John the Baptist,

00:27:58.949 --> 00:28:01.133
his father is the priest
Zachariah, his mother is

00:28:01.133 --> 00:28:01.769
Elizabeth.
 

00:28:01.769 --> 00:28:04.938
And this is the prophecy that
comes with the angel to

00:28:04.938 --> 00:28:05.670
Zachariah.
 

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:08.237
"You will have joy and
gladness and many will rejoice

00:28:08.237 --> 00:28:10.038
at his birth,
for he will be great in the

00:28:10.038 --> 00:28:11.028
sight of the Lord.
 

00:28:11.028 --> 00:28:13.278
He must never drink wine or
strong drink;

00:28:13.278 --> 00:28:15.320
even before his birth he will
be filled with the Holy

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:15.910
Spirit."
 

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:21.200
John the Baptist is portrayed
like Elijah.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.035
You read stories about Elijah;
similar things are said about

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:24.328
him.
 

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:30.930
Look at 2:36,
we're going to move quickly,

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:33.734
There was a prophet,
Anna the daughter of Phaneul,

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:35.108
of the tribe of Asher.
 

00:28:35.108 --> 00:28:37.299
You hear how biblical that
sounds?

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.170
That's real biblical.
 

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:41.477
The guy who wrote this,
I don't think he was a Jew,

00:28:41.477 --> 00:28:44.013
I think he was probably a
Gentile, but he spoke Greek as

00:28:44.013 --> 00:28:45.029
his main language.
 

00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:49.087
It's not like he's just
automatically talking this way

00:28:49.087 --> 00:28:51.220
in a sense,
I think he's consciously

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:53.338
constructing his book to sound
like the Bible,

00:28:53.338 --> 00:28:56.288
to sound like the Jewish
scripture.

00:28:56.288 --> 00:28:58.098
She was of great age,
having lived with her husband

00:28:58.098 --> 00:29:00.938
seven years after her marriage,
then as a widow to the age of

00:29:00.938 --> 00:29:04.099
eighty-four she never left the
temple [there's the temple]

00:29:04.099 --> 00:29:07.039
but worshipped there with
fasting and prayer night and

00:29:07.039 --> 00:29:07.538
day.
 

00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:09.842
At that moment she came,
and began to praise God and to

00:29:09.842 --> 00:29:11.334
speak about the child [that's
Jesus]

00:29:11.334 --> 00:29:13.680
to all who are looking for
redemption of Jerusalem.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.834
Anna is this holy woman,
just like many of the holy

00:29:16.834 --> 00:29:18.160
women in the Bible.
 

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.460
Then you have these psalms and
prayers.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.278
I've already talked about the
Magnificat, that Mary says.

00:29:23.278 --> 00:29:29.388
Look also at 1:68,
this is the prayer that

00:29:29.388 --> 00:29:36.990
Zachariah, the father of John
the Baptist prays:

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:39.442
"Blessed be the Lord God
of Israel for he has looked

00:29:39.442 --> 00:29:41.368
favorably on his people and
redeemed them.

00:29:41.368 --> 00:29:43.104
He has raised up a mighty
Savior for us in the house of

00:29:43.104 --> 00:29:43.940
his servant David."
 

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.861
In other words,
he goes on to quote basically

00:29:45.861 --> 00:29:47.038
what sounds like a psalm.
 

00:29:47.038 --> 00:29:52.480
It's very much a psalm-like
piece of literary poetry there.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.250
Mary had her Magnificat,
which sounds like scripture.

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:58.483
Zachariah has his Benedictus,
again these are these songs

00:29:58.483 --> 00:30:01.724
that if you're Roman Catholic,
or if you're Episcopalian

00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:04.717
or--do Lutherans say the
Magnificat and the Benedictus in

00:30:04.717 --> 00:30:06.160
these things in liturgy?
 

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.318
Any Lutherans in here?
 

00:30:07.318 --> 00:30:10.380
Any other denominations in here
say these things?

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.097
I'm not sure I know which ones
actually say the Magnificat,

00:30:13.097 --> 00:30:15.910
"my soul magnifies the
Lord," or the Benedictus.

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:18.484
If you're Roman Catholic or
Episcopalian you say these

00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:20.038
psalms as part of the liturgy.
 

00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:22.111
They come from the New
Testament but they sound very

00:30:22.111 --> 00:30:23.329
much like the Old Testament.
 

00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:26.279
Zachariah has one;
we call it the Benedictus

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:28.442
because in Latin,
if you had a Latin Bible in

00:30:28.442 --> 00:30:30.923
front of you,
the first word of that psalm

00:30:30.923 --> 00:30:35.425
would be benedictus,
"blessed be the Lord God

00:30:35.425 --> 00:30:36.990
of Israel."
 

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:42.348
The other psalm is 2:19,
which Simeon prays.

00:30:42.348 --> 00:30:45.067
Simeon's this holy man living
in the temple,

00:30:45.067 --> 00:30:47.660
again there's that theme of the
temple.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:49.710
When he sees Jesus the baby he
says,

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:51.651
"Master,
now you are dismissing your

00:30:51.651 --> 00:30:53.690
servant in peace according to
your word.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.423
For my eyes have seen your
salvation, which you have

00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:59.746
prepared in the presence of all
peoples, a light for revelation

00:30:59.746 --> 00:31:01.140
to the Gentiles."
 

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.318
Already at the very beginning
of the Gospel,

00:31:03.318 --> 00:31:06.798
though Jesus himself won't go
to the Gentiles during his life,

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:09.548
this is something that Luke
will wait until Acts to show us.

00:31:09.548 --> 00:31:12.435
Simeon predicts it,
he prophesied about it in this

00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:13.318
little psalm.
 

00:31:13.318 --> 00:31:16.740
This is called the Nunc
Dimittis in Christian liturgical

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.978
tradition,
because in Latin "now

00:31:18.978 --> 00:31:22.108
departs your servant,"
that's what the Latin means.

00:31:22.108 --> 00:31:24.923
Then there's the piety of the
holy family already mentioned

00:31:24.923 --> 00:31:25.358
before.
 

00:31:25.358 --> 00:31:29.643
Only Luke tells us about the
circumcision of Jesus,

00:31:29.643 --> 00:31:30.500
in 2:21.
 

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.420
Only Luke tells us in 2:22,
this is worth looking at,

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:39.622
"That after the prescribed
period according to the law of

00:31:39.622 --> 00:31:43.480
Moses," Jesus' family
followed the law of Moses very

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.098
well.
 

00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:47.609
They brought him up to
Jerusalem to present him to the

00:31:47.609 --> 00:31:49.515
Lord,
as it is written in the law of

00:31:49.515 --> 00:31:50.939
the Lord,
"Every first born male

00:31:50.939 --> 00:31:52.538
shall be designated as holy to
the Lord."

00:31:52.538 --> 00:31:54.757
They offered a sacrifice
according to what is stated in

00:31:54.757 --> 00:31:56.809
the law of the Lord,
a pair of turtle doves and two

00:31:56.809 --> 00:31:57.548
young pigeons.
 

00:31:57.548 --> 00:31:59.009
In other words,
over and over again,

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:00.660
I could cite several different
other examples,

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.940
Luke wants to portray the holy
family,

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:07.242
John the Baptist's family,
and the holy family of Jesus

00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:11.220
and Jesus himself as all being
good Jews who honor the temple,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.390
who keep the law.
 

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.509
They do everything like they're
supposed to do.

00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:18.130
It's no surprise that when you
get to the book of Acts the

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:21.813
theme that comes out more than
anything is "to the Jew

00:32:21.813 --> 00:32:22.828
first."
 

00:32:22.828 --> 00:32:26.402
Look at Acts,
I'm not going to read all of

00:32:26.402 --> 00:32:31.990
this,
but Acts 13:46,

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:44.013
this is Paul and Barnabas,
they've been speaking on the

00:32:44.013 --> 00:32:49.700
Sabbath day to a crowd in a
synagogue and the people--

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.289
some of them believe and some
get jealous.

00:32:51.289 --> 00:32:55.443
In 13:46:
Then both Paul and Barnabas

00:32:55.443 --> 00:32:58.400
spoke out boldly saying,
"It was necessary that the

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.905
word of God should be spoken
first to you [that is to the

00:33:01.905 --> 00:33:02.470
Jews].
 

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:06.828
Since you reject it and judge
yourselves to be unworthy of

00:33:06.828 --> 00:33:09.736
eternal life,
we are now turning to the

00:33:09.736 --> 00:33:11.190
Gentiles."
 

00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:18.164
It happens again--the same
thing is said in Acts 18:6,

00:33:18.164 --> 00:33:22.640
the same thing is said in
26:20.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.308
Over and over again,
see Paul goes to a town,

00:33:26.308 --> 00:33:29.818
he goes first to the synagogue,
he preaches in the synagogue,

00:33:29.818 --> 00:33:32.980
the Jews reject him,
he kind of shakes the dust off

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.444
his feet,
you Jews rejected the Gospel

00:33:35.444 --> 00:33:37.818
therefore we're going to the
Gentiles.

00:33:37.818 --> 00:33:40.494
But he never gets to a point
where he finally and completely

00:33:40.494 --> 00:33:42.942
turns away from the Jews;
he keeps going back to the Jews

00:33:42.942 --> 00:33:44.009
in every town he gets too.
 

00:33:44.009 --> 00:33:47.299
This idea that the message must
be preached first to the Jews

00:33:47.299 --> 00:33:50.433
and only then to the Gentiles,
is a point that Acts makes

00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:52.380
over, and over,
and over again.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.450
So is it any surprise that in
the Gospel of Luke he wanted

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.950
to--he's careful to set up Jesus
as a good Jew?

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.808
That's the beginning of it.
 

00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:04.101
It's only later that it will go
to the Gentiles,

00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:07.026
so that pattern gets played out
over and over again until the

00:34:07.026 --> 00:34:08.050
very end of Acts.
 

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.266
Now look at the end of Acts,
chapter 28 of Acts,

00:34:11.266 --> 00:34:12.019
verse 28.
 

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.960
This is at the end of Paul's
last speech in Acts.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.918
He was in Jerusalem,
he was actually trying to go

00:34:26.918 --> 00:34:31.007
worship in the temple,
but some of the bad Jews who

00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:35.572
didn't like Paul thought he was
trying to take Gentiles into the

00:34:35.572 --> 00:34:38.079
temple,
which would have been against

00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:38.610
the law.
 

00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:41.400
So they grab him,
a big riot ensues,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.969
and they take Paul before the
Sanhedrin,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:49.119
the big sort of Jerusalem kind
of senate type body,

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.750
and they put him on trial.
 

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:53.070
Paul's message in all of these
things is that,

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.190
I didn't do anything wrong,
I'm just here to obey the law,

00:34:56.190 --> 00:35:01.152
I'm here to serve my people,
to honor the traditions of my

00:35:01.152 --> 00:35:04.550
people and my ethnic group,
the Jews.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:07.688
And then eventually,
though, such a big dispute

00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:11.989
arises that Paul is arrested by
the Roman governor in order--

00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:14.019
he says to protect Paul from
being lynched.

00:35:14.019 --> 00:35:16.110
Paul is imprisoned then.
 

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:20.460
Finally Paul is afraid he's
going to lose a trial with

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.936
these--
his Jewish enemies on one side,

00:35:22.936 --> 00:35:25.737
so he appeals to the Roman
governor straight to the

00:35:25.737 --> 00:35:27.521
Emperor,
he says, I'm a Roman citizen,

00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:29.911
I appeal to the Emperor,
so that means he has to go to

00:35:29.911 --> 00:35:30.199
Rome.
 

00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:31.719
They have to take him to Rome
for trial.

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:34.739
The last part,
chapter 28 is Paul in Rome.

00:35:34.739 --> 00:35:37.338
He preaches again there,
he has the same kind of things

00:35:37.338 --> 00:35:39.284
happen,
he rents a hall where he again

00:35:39.284 --> 00:35:42.360
conducts classes and conducts
sermons, and that sort of thing.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.289
And then this last sermon that
he's given to the Jewish leaders

00:35:45.289 --> 00:35:47.746
and the Jewish elders,
and notice how it turns out he

00:35:47.746 --> 00:35:49.724
says:
"Let it be known to you

00:35:49.724 --> 00:35:53.110
then that this salvation of God
has been sent to the Gentiles.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.909
They will listen."
 

00:35:55.909 --> 00:35:58.039
He lived there two whole years
at his own expense.

00:35:58.039 --> 00:36:00.800
He welcomed all who came to
him, proclaiming the kingdom of

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.702
God and teaching about the Lord
Jesus Christ with all boldness

00:36:03.702 --> 00:36:04.940
and without hindrance.
 

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:08.192
In other words,
the very end of the two-volume

00:36:08.192 --> 00:36:12.746
work ends with this message that
the message was preached to the

00:36:12.746 --> 00:36:14.235
Jews,
they rejected it,

00:36:14.235 --> 00:36:16.260
so Paul and the others went to
the Gentiles.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.827
And it ends up in Rome,
the capital of the whole world

00:36:19.827 --> 00:36:23.932
which represents the idea that
the Gospel has now proceeded to

00:36:23.932 --> 00:36:25.280
the whole world.
 

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:34.289
Isn't it funny that this author
doesn't tell us what happened to

00:36:34.289 --> 00:36:35.289
Paul?
 

00:36:35.289 --> 00:36:41.010
Does anybody know how Paul
supposedly died?

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:42.349
Anybody know?
 

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:43.090
Yes sir?
 

00:36:43.090 --> 00:36:44.079
Student:  Decapitated.
 

00:36:44.079 --> 00:36:46.639
Prof: He was
decapitated, not accidentally.

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:50.559
It was a Roman sword that did
it.

00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:54.090
According to Christian
tradition, Paul was martyred by

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.887
being beheaded because he was a
Roman soldier [correction:

00:36:57.887 --> 00:36:59.980
citizen],
again according to tradition,

00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.579
Paul actually never tells us he
was a--

00:37:01.579 --> 00:37:02.710
I mean a Roman citizen.
 

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.827
He never tells us that he was a
Roman citizen,

00:37:04.827 --> 00:37:07.650
but according to tradition he
was, and in Acts claims that he

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.780
was a Roman citizen.
 

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.590
According to that tradition you
can't crucify a Roman citizen.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.994
So the tradition was that Paul
was martyred but unlike Peter

00:37:14.994 --> 00:37:19.317
who was crucified upside down,
according to tradition,

00:37:19.317 --> 00:37:24.431
Paul was beheaded in Rome,
probably sometime in the 60s,

00:37:24.431 --> 00:37:26.079
that's the tradition.
 

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:30.539
Why doesn't Luke tell us that
story?

00:37:30.539 --> 00:37:33.840
Wouldn't that be the more
logical end of the story?

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.199
He's told us about Paul's
ministry,

00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:38.735
he's told us about Paul's call,
he's told us Paul becoming an

00:37:38.735 --> 00:37:40.518
Apostle,
he's told about Paul's

00:37:40.518 --> 00:37:44.697
different missionary journeys,
and he ends up with Paul living

00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:46.518
in rented rooms in Rome.
 

00:37:46.518 --> 00:37:50.219
I don't think this author
wanted to tell us about how the

00:37:50.219 --> 00:37:52.748
story ended,
if it actually ended with Paul

00:37:52.748 --> 00:37:55.507
being martyred in Rome,
because that kind of would

00:37:55.507 --> 00:37:57.590
spoil the story,
wouldn't it?

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.610
Although you kind of could get
the hint that,

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.320
since all prophets and all
messengers of the Gospel,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.219
according to this author,
are martyred and rejected,

00:38:06.219 --> 00:38:09.835
then maybe he could have
portrayed Paul as a martyr and

00:38:09.835 --> 00:38:12.650
told about his death after all
because,

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:15.224
and that's a nice little segue
way into the next major theme of

00:38:15.224 --> 00:38:16.969
Luke-Acts that I'm going to talk
about,

00:38:16.969 --> 00:38:19.340
prophets as martyrs.
 

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.420
Prophets in Luke-Acts get
martyred.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.750
Jesus was one of them.
 

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:28.643
Notice, first John the Baptist,
I'm not going to read this

00:38:28.643 --> 00:38:31.130
because we're running a little
bit out of time.

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:34.239
John the Baptist himself gets
martyred.

00:38:34.239 --> 00:38:37.768
Jesus also is a prophet martyr.
 

00:38:37.768 --> 00:38:40.103
Look at Luke 9:31,
now unfortunately we're going

00:38:40.103 --> 00:38:42.288
to be going back and forth from
Luke to Acts,

00:38:42.288 --> 00:38:44.920
so you might want to keep
fingers in both places.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:51.786
This is a very important point,
9:31 of Luke,

00:38:51.786 --> 00:39:00.840
this is the transfiguration
story, you know how it goes.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.780
Jesus takes some of his
disciples Peter,

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:06.027
John, and James up onto a
mountain and while they're up

00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:07.688
there,
this is on their way to

00:39:07.688 --> 00:39:11.230
Jerusalem, clouds overcome,
it's thunder and lightning.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.469
Imagine Cecil B. DeMille,
Hollywood type lighting

00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:15.280
effects.
 

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.914
And Jesus appears there with
Moses and Elijah flaming,

00:39:18.914 --> 00:39:20.150
they're shining.
 

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.891
And Peter says something,
and there's a voice from

00:39:22.891 --> 00:39:24.739
heaven, all that sort of thing.
 

00:39:24.739 --> 00:39:28.835
But notice most of the Gospels
don't tell us what Jesus and

00:39:28.835 --> 00:39:32.860
Moses and Elijah were talking
about up on the mountain.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:39.307
Luke tells us, 31:
They appeared in glory and were

00:39:39.307 --> 00:39:43.186
speaking of his departure which
was about to be accomplished at

00:39:43.186 --> 00:39:44.000
Jerusalem.
 

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.639
Now the Greek word there for
departure is exodus.

00:39:49.639 --> 00:39:52.532
Yep, that word,
the very word of the second

00:39:52.532 --> 00:39:54.530
book of the Bible in Greek.
 

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:58.010
They're talking to Jesus about
his exodus.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.543
If you read that in Greek that
would immediately--now I know

00:40:01.543 --> 00:40:03.699
why Moses is there talking to
him.

00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:06.539
He needs some advice on how to
do an exodus,

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:10.501
and the exodus doesn't refer to
just his leaving the country,

00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:12.550
it refers to his martyrdom.
 

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:17.079
And Jesus also will be
portrayed as the prophet to the

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:18.190
Jews first.
 

00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:20.829
I've already talked about
Stephen being a prophet and a

00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:21.268
martyr.
 

00:40:21.268 --> 00:40:24.179
The end of Acts with Paul in
Rome,

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.449
again I just read it to you,
Paul ends up as a prophet to

00:40:27.449 --> 00:40:29.936
the Jews,
he is the innocent martyr,

00:40:29.936 --> 00:40:33.099
he's proclaimed innocent over
and over again.

00:40:33.099 --> 00:40:35.715
Several times,
as a matter of fact,

00:40:35.715 --> 00:40:40.719
Paul will be proclaimed--first
Jesus is proclaimed as innocent.

00:40:40.719 --> 00:40:43.474
People--the different rulers
will say, this guy's innocent,

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:45.375
he's innocent,
what are you getting upset

00:40:45.375 --> 00:40:45.849
about?
 

00:40:45.849 --> 00:40:48.244
Over and over again,
Paul himself will be taken to

00:40:48.244 --> 00:40:49.766
governors,
Roman governors,

00:40:49.766 --> 00:40:52.318
and they'll say,
well I would have released him

00:40:52.318 --> 00:40:55.980
but now he's appealed to Rome so
we've got to send him to Rome.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.989
When he gets to Rome,
even the Jewish elders in Rome,

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.976
who first see him,
they say now we've heard

00:41:00.976 --> 00:41:02.211
rumors,
Paul, about you,

00:41:02.211 --> 00:41:04.070
we've heard some bad stuff
about you,

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.380
but we don't have any good
evidence.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.909
You're innocent as far as we're
concerned.

00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:15.559
Even the Jewish leaders in Rome
declare Paul innocent,

00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:19.934
so, over and over again,
people in the Book of Acts and

00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:24.309
Luke are portrayed as innocent
martyrs and prophets.

00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:27.206
Notice how we see there all
these different diversities of

00:41:27.206 --> 00:41:27.969
Christianity.
 

00:41:27.969 --> 00:41:31.039
Those are some basic themes,
but if you take--what do these

00:41:31.039 --> 00:41:34.110
different Christian groups
believe about the Jewish law?

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.920
What did Moses believe about
the Jewish law?

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.150
Anybody remember?
 

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:45.032
What was Moses stance on what
people should do with the Jewish

00:41:45.032 --> 00:41:45.710
law?
 

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.760
You know, just remember back a
week or so.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.610
What did I say, Moses?
 

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.170
I mean Matthew, I'm sorry.
 

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:56.909
I'm crazy.
 

00:41:56.909 --> 00:41:59.860
What was Matthew's view of the
Mosaic Law?

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:01.960
What did Matthew believe about
the Mosaic Law?

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:06.889
All followers of Jesus should
obey it, it's just there.

00:42:06.889 --> 00:42:09.409
Matthew doesn't ever get rid of
the Jewish law;

00:42:09.409 --> 00:42:10.889
he never has Jesus get rid of
the Jewish law.

00:42:10.889 --> 00:42:13.489
What does Mark say about the
Jewish law?

00:42:13.489 --> 00:42:18.324
Well, Jesus declared all foods
clean, so Jesus modifies the

00:42:18.324 --> 00:42:21.909
Jewish law in a substantial way
for Mark.

00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:25.570
What does Luke believe about
the Jewish law?

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:26.809
This is an interesting point.
 

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:31.764
Luke believes that the Jewish
law is the ethnic contract,

00:42:31.764 --> 00:42:35.302
if you will,
the ethnic traditions of the

00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:36.099
Jews.
 

00:42:36.099 --> 00:42:39.130
It came from God,
it came from Moses,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:42.260
and Jews keep it,
so throughout Acts,

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.882
if you notice,
the Jewish followers of Jesus

00:42:44.882 --> 00:42:47.489
continue to keep the law,
even Paul.

00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:52.268
The Gentile followers of Jesus
aren't required to keep the law.

00:42:52.268 --> 00:42:56.059
It's as if--and people in the
ancient world knew this,

00:42:56.059 --> 00:43:00.380
Americans have their law,
Canadians have their law,

00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:03.619
Britain's have their law,
the French have their law,

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:06.670
sort of.
 

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:11.891
Every nation and ethnic group
has its own laws,

00:43:11.891 --> 00:43:12.800
right?
 

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.369
This is the way Luke is
thinking about the Jewish law.

00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:19.804
He says, of course it's good,
it's good for Jews,

00:43:19.804 --> 00:43:21.809
so should Jews avoid pork?
 

00:43:21.809 --> 00:43:22.969
Yeah, they're Jews.
 

00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:24.480
Should Jews be circumcised?
 

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.090
Yeah, they're Jews.
 

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:29.371
Even if they're followers of
Jesus they still keep the Jewish

00:43:29.371 --> 00:43:29.699
law.
 

00:43:29.699 --> 00:43:32.409
Gentiles?
 

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:35.672
Totally other story;
why should they not keep the

00:43:35.672 --> 00:43:36.639
Law of Moses?
 

00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:38.840
They're not Jews.
 

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:44.659
The view of the Law of Moses
that you get in Luke and Acts,

00:43:44.659 --> 00:43:49.840
is that the law is good ethnic
law and custom for the Jewish

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.161
people,
and it's perfectly fine for

00:43:52.161 --> 00:43:53.869
them to obey it and to keep it.
 

00:43:53.869 --> 00:43:57.719
It's just not binding on the
Gentile followers of Jesus.

00:43:57.719 --> 00:44:00.255
They will have other ethical
things to follow,

00:44:00.255 --> 00:44:03.300
and he gives you some of those
things in chapter 15.

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.130
That's actually very different
from what we've seen in Matthew

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.110
or even in Mark,
right?

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.239
Luke has a different view of
the law.

00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:15.010
These are diversities of
Christianity we see.

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:18.250
They weren't all in agreement
about this.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.099
They probably didn't even know
what the others thought.

00:44:20.099 --> 00:44:22.469
They may have been living in
different geographical areas,

00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:25.235
and just developed their own
different views about what is

00:44:25.235 --> 00:44:28.389
the Jewish law and how should it
affect the followers of Jesus.

00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:33.039
When we get to Paul it'll be
another story entirely because,

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:35.349
it may surprise you,
Paul will believe--

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:39.351
Luke seems to believe that--he
doesn't really come out and say

00:44:39.351 --> 00:44:39.679
it.
 

00:44:39.679 --> 00:44:42.090
If there's a Gentile who sort
of wants to keep kosher,

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:45.139
or wants to get circumcised,
well, it's no big deal,

00:44:45.139 --> 00:44:47.360
in fact he has Paul circumcise
Timothy,

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:49.889
his follower at one point.
 

00:44:49.889 --> 00:44:52.398
Timothy wasn't circumcised,
they're going to be going

00:44:52.398 --> 00:44:54.280
through some Jewish areas,
so Paul says,

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.969
yeah, let's circumcise Timothy.
 

00:44:55.969 --> 00:44:59.800
Well the Paul of his letters
doesn't like that at all.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:03.322
He basically says,
if you're a follower of Jesus

00:45:03.322 --> 00:45:06.920
and a Gentile,
you cannot keep the Jewish law;

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.130
otherwise you will fall from
grace.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.768
Trying to keep the law,
the Law of Moses,

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:18.320
if you're a Gentile disciple of
Jesus is anathema for Paul.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:23.010
And that'll get him in big
trouble with both Jews and

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:27.250
Jewish Christians,
Jewish followers of Jesus.

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.206
The point I'm making is that
when we get to Paul we'll see

00:45:30.206 --> 00:45:32.539
another different kind of view
of the law,

00:45:32.539 --> 00:45:35.650
so it all shows that these
people were trying to figure out

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.708
what does it mean to follow a
Jewish Messiah if you're not

00:45:38.708 --> 00:45:39.300
Jewish?
 

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:42.686
What does it mean that we're
following a Messiah who was

00:45:42.686 --> 00:45:46.257
predicted by Moses in the law
and yet we're not keeping the

00:45:46.257 --> 00:45:46.750
law?
 

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.239
In fact, they would say,
what does it mean to have a

00:45:49.239 --> 00:45:50.070
Messiah at all?
 

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:51.110
What does Messiah mean?
 

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:53.177
Here's the last little
difference I'll say in the next

00:45:53.177 --> 00:45:55.518
two or three minutes because
we'll come back to this also.

00:45:55.518 --> 00:45:58.786
We've already seen different
Christologies,

00:45:58.786 --> 00:46:01.510
one of those two bit words
again.

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.889
What does Christology mean?
 

00:46:03.889 --> 00:46:09.650
Anybody?
 

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:12.101
Student:  Whether you
believe Jesus was human or

00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:12.510
divine.
 

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.898
Prof: Whether you
believe Jesus was human or

00:46:14.898 --> 00:46:15.329
divine.
 

00:46:15.329 --> 00:46:18.429
Very good, it means any
doctrine of Jesus.

00:46:18.429 --> 00:46:22.050
It could be whether he was
human or divine,

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:26.878
it could be whether he's a
fish, any teaching about Jesus

00:46:26.878 --> 00:46:28.690
is a Christology.
 

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.922
It's what is your theology of
Jesus Christ,

00:46:30.922 --> 00:46:34.059
that's Christology and we've
already seen different ones.

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:39.972
For example,
I've already said Mark believes

00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:44.510
that Jesus' death was a ransom.
 

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.260
Jesus died for your sins.
 

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.480
His death was sort of like a
sacrifice, say.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.056
But at one point in Mark 10:45
Jesus says to his disciples,

00:46:55.056 --> 00:46:59.556
"The Son of Man came to
give his life as a ransom for

00:46:59.556 --> 00:47:00.739
many."
 

00:47:00.739 --> 00:47:04.753
In other words,
Jesus' death is for you,

00:47:04.753 --> 00:47:07.739
to buy you up,
to save you.

00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:11.099
That's picked up in Matthew
20:28, do you know what?

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.610
That saying is never found in
Luke.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:17.829
In fact, you can find nothing
in the Gospel of Luke which

00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:22.501
identifies the death of Jesus as
being an atonement for sins of

00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:23.329
people.
 

00:47:23.329 --> 00:47:27.836
Luke does not take Jesus' death
as being a ransom in the way

00:47:27.836 --> 00:47:29.900
that Mark and Matthew do.
 

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.389
Why?
 

00:47:31.389 --> 00:47:34.219
Jesus' death is important for
Luke, right?

00:47:34.219 --> 00:47:37.230
But again what is the meaning
of Jesus' death in Luke?

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.150
A prophet martyr.
 

00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:42.909
He's the innocent prophet who
is martyred for his prophecy.

00:47:42.909 --> 00:47:47.380
That's the meaning of the death
of Jesus in Luke and Acts.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.896
We have very different
Christologies about the meaning

00:47:49.896 --> 00:47:52.699
of the death of Jesus already in
these different Gospels.

00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:55.036
All of this is just to say
we're going to find this again,

00:47:55.036 --> 00:47:57.248
we can find it in John,
we're going to find it in other

00:47:57.248 --> 00:47:57.699
places.
 

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:01.018
These early Christian texts,
if you read them really,

00:48:01.018 --> 00:48:02.393
really carefully,
not quickly,

00:48:02.393 --> 00:48:04.900
carefully,
you'll see amazing ways that it

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:08.197
opens up whole windows into the
very earliest period of

00:48:08.197 --> 00:48:11.920
Christianity that most modern
people have no idea existed.

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.860
The idea that there could be
Christians who didn't believe

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.460
Jesus' life was an atonement.
 

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.914
The idea that there were
Christians who believed every

00:48:18.914 --> 00:48:20.719
Christian should keep the Jewish
law.

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:23.342
The idea we've also seen that
there could have been Christians

00:48:23.342 --> 00:48:25.880
who believed that the God who
created the world was evil.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.050
These were all there.
 

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:30.780
We'll talk about another form
of it next week.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.380
See you next week.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.340
Professor John Rogers:
In the invocation to Book

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.201
Nine of Paradise Lost,
Milton describes -- and

00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:11.282
it's wonderful to see this
representation of this process

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.648
that, I think,
we've been wondering about --

00:00:13.648 --> 00:00:16.398
he describes the process by
which the heavenly muse

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:19.754
inspires, and he says inspires
nightly, the composition of his

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:21.959
epic.
He explains that the subject

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:24.725
for his heroic song -- and of
course, we'll be getting to Book

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:27.445
Nine later,
but it's relevant for our

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:32.034
discussion today -- Milton
explains that the subject for

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:36.348
his heroic song,
the subject of the Fall of man,

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:41.190
"pleas'd me long choosing,
and beginning lateâ€¦"

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.950
-- pleased me long choosing and
beginning late.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.212
We know very well Milton
decided to write an epic poem at

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.834
a very early age,
but his decision to write an

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:51.421
epic poem,
some epic, long predated his

00:00:51.421 --> 00:00:54.900
sense of what exactly that epic
was going to be about.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.764
He was long in choosing the
subject of his heroic song and,

00:00:59.764 --> 00:01:04.629
as we know from all of -- and
we've encountered a number of

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.739
them -- all of those
protestations of delay Milton

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:13.896
began his epic late.
We last left the poet in the

00:01:13.896 --> 00:01:16.023
1640s.
Areopagitica,

00:01:16.023 --> 00:01:18.549
you'll remember,
was written in 1644.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.848
The story of Adam and Eve and
of the fall of Satan may strike

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:27.003
us -- having read or about to
read Paradise Lost  --

00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.729
may strike us as a natural
subject for Milton to have

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.099
chosen for his epic poem.
After all, this is an extremely

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:37.645
pious Puritan.
But as late as the 1640s,

00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:40.715
this was not at all the epic
subject that Milton was

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:43.526
intending to use.
Milton -- and we know this --

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.520
Milton was a political
revolutionary,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.290
and when he anticipated writing
the great poem,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.013
he consistently imagined that
it would be a poem on a

00:01:53.013 --> 00:01:56.414
nationalist theme.
Milton's would be an epic

00:01:56.414 --> 00:02:00.091
demonstrating the origins and
the heroic achievement of his

00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.870
own nation, England;
or maybe he'd be thinking a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.973
little broadly of Britain,
which is England,

00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.839
Scotland and Wales.
In this respect it would

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:12.088
resemble Spenser's Faerie
Queene, or perhaps

00:02:12.088 --> 00:02:15.397
more importantly,
Virgil's Aeneid --

00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:18.837
other nationalist
epics.Now Milton at the same

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:22.861
time -- we're talking about the
1640s -- had been contemplating

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.730
writing a play.
That was supposed to be a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.432
tragedy that,
in some manuscript drafts that

00:02:28.432 --> 00:02:31.699
we still have today -- in some
manuscript drafts,

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:39.819
he titled this prospective
tragedy Paradise Lost and

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.139
in other drafts Adam
Unparadised.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.614
Actually all of these early
drafts -- these notes,

00:02:48.614 --> 00:02:52.482
these outlines for this tragedy
that actually never seems to

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:56.349
have gotten written -- are
included in the Tyco packet.

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.442
But by the time Milton begins
writing his epic,

00:02:59.442 --> 00:03:02.669
he abandons his plan for a
nationalistic poem,

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.469
a nationalist poem,
and decides instead to use the

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.954
subject matter that he had been
intending for that prospective

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.099
tragedy,
Paradise Lost.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.768
So the reasons for this really
enormous shift in plans,

00:03:14.768 --> 00:03:17.689
and the enormous shift in
subject matter,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:23.341
are worth exploring.Milton
had devoted nineteen years to

00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:27.684
the world of politics.
A lot has happened since the

00:03:27.684 --> 00:03:31.773
exuberant optimism of the
political spirit that we see in

00:03:31.773 --> 00:03:35.451
a tract like Areopagitica.
In 1649,

00:03:35.451 --> 00:03:42.160
the great Puritan Revolution
reached an unspeakable climax.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.720
A minority government of
revolutionary Puritans had

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.639
effectively taken control of the
state.

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.702
The radical Puritan Parliament
voted to execute the tyrant --

00:03:52.702 --> 00:03:55.410
what they considered to be the
tyrant,

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.090
King Charles I -- and to
establish its own government.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.555
Milton participated with
extraordinary enthusiasm and

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:06.419
considerable zeal in the
establishment of England's new,

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.834
non-monarchic government,
initially a commonwealth and

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:12.539
then what we can think of as a
republic.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.836
He had been the foremost
propagandist for the Puritan

00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:18.284
side.
He had not only written really

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:22.225
quite daringly on behalf of the
execution of this particular

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:24.027
king,
but he wrote another pamphlet,

00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:26.730
Eikonoklastes (which is
included in the Hughes edition),

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.622
 which is a shocking
defense of just regicide in

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:33.229
general -- not just in England,
but as a kind of political

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.483
principle.Milton probably
around this time,

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:40.162
around the time that he was
writing and finishing the

00:04:40.162 --> 00:04:44.300
regicide treatises,
began to lose his eyesight.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.600
This is in the earliest years
of the commonwealth government.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.204
Nonetheless,
even blind, Milton served the

00:04:53.204 --> 00:04:56.889
new regime as both a state
licenser -- and I won't even get

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.446
in to the irony of the fact that
Milton seems to [laughs]

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:04.387
actually become the licenser,
the licenser of printed text

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.024
that, of course,
he had seven or eight years

00:05:07.024 --> 00:05:10.029
before so utterly abhorred in
Areopagitica.

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.102
He seems to have had some
work as the state licenser,

00:05:13.102 --> 00:05:15.956
but also more importantly (and
this was a much bigger

00:05:15.956 --> 00:05:18.589
commitment) as the nation's
Latin secretary,

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.718
which means that he would
compose and translate all of

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:27.470
England's correspondence with
the governments on the continent

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.988
into and from Latin.
Up until this period,

00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:33.813
the early 1650s,
Milton was a devoted

00:05:33.813 --> 00:05:38.680
contributor to the ideal Puritan
notion of this government,

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.943
and it was really the height of
his political idealism.Fast

00:05:42.943 --> 00:05:46.435
forward a few more years.
By the end of this decade,

00:05:46.435 --> 00:05:49.014
by the end of the 1650s,
Milton could see,

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:52.784
as could others,
fairly clearly that what we can

00:05:52.784 --> 00:05:56.937
think of as the imminent
collapse of the republican

00:05:56.937 --> 00:05:59.708
government.
The majority of Englishmen were

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:02.769
calling for the return of their
nation's rightful monarch.

00:06:02.769 --> 00:06:08.272
It wasn't long before the
revolution failed and the Stuart

00:06:08.272 --> 00:06:12.792
monarchy was restored.
The son of the executed king,

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:16.665
who had been in exile in
France, was returned to the

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:19.849
throne in England;
and so at the Restoration -- as

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.875
it's called, the restoration
which took place in 1660 -- the

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:26.245
Puritan revolutionaries,
the revolutionaries like Milton

00:06:26.245 --> 00:06:29.960
who had devoted their labors to
the success of this utopian

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.329
ideal of the Puritan
commonwealth,

00:06:32.329 --> 00:06:36.790
experienced a humiliating and
bitter defeat.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.141
A lot of Milton's friends,
a lot of Milton's comrades,

00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:45.748
were hanged and quartered.
Milton himself was jailed and

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:49.730
jailed for having written the
regicide treatises,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.821
we have to assume,
and it seems to have been

00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:54.497
solely the influence of some
important friends that kept

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.930
Milton from being held in prison
indefinitely.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.396
It's entirely imaginable that
Milton could have been executed

00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:06.769
for his writings on behalf of
the killing of King

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:11.598
Charles.So it's at this
point -- this is after the

00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:16.792
revolution has failed that
Milton begins to write his epic

00:07:16.792 --> 00:07:23.170
poem: it's at this point that
Milton chooses to write an epic,

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.793
not on a nationalist theme as
Virgil had done or as Spenser

00:07:27.793 --> 00:07:31.618
had done.
There was simply no nation

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:35.606
worth writing about.
All of Milton's labors in the

00:07:35.606 --> 00:07:39.041
cause of liberating England from
the tyranny of monarchy had in

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.199
some way -- could be construed
as having been useless.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.025
All of Milton's expectations
that England might actually be

00:07:45.025 --> 00:07:47.509
transformed, and they were
glorious expectations,

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.819
into something like a Puritan
utopia or even a Puritan

00:07:50.819 --> 00:07:53.629
paradise -- all of that had been
destroyed.

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:58.092
It's at this point that Milton
chose for the subject of his

00:07:58.092 --> 00:08:01.939
epic poem the subject of the
tragedy that he'd been

00:08:01.939 --> 00:08:08.235
contemplating for so many years.
The epic was going to treat the

00:08:08.235 --> 00:08:14.830
Fall, the Fall of Adam and Eve
from their blissful state in

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.928
Eden,
but also the fall of the rebel

00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:20.699
angels after their failed
revolution.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.797
There's a continual analogy
running through Paradise

00:08:22.797 --> 00:08:24.699
Lost, and it's a very
troubling one,

00:08:24.699 --> 00:08:29.372
that associates the paradise
that man lost with the utopian

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:33.443
government that England lost.
Of course, perhaps even more

00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:35.860
troubling is the satanic
parallel as well.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:41.567
You'll want to think about why
Milton seems so aggressively to

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:47.088
invite the association of the
failure of the just revolution

00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:50.734
of the Puritans,
and of course that's how he

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:53.560
would see it,
with the failure of the unjust

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.913
revolution of the rebel angels
under the guidance of

00:08:56.913 --> 00:09:00.528
Satan.Milton began writing
his epic poem too late to

00:09:00.528 --> 00:09:03.419
celebrate a virtuous political
realm.

00:09:03.419 --> 00:09:06.342
It's too late for this to be a
political poem,

00:09:06.342 --> 00:09:10.240
but Paradise Lost is
late for all sorts of reasons.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.519
It's late for some personal
reasons as well.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.482
Milton had been,
as you know,

00:09:15.482 --> 00:09:19.688
anticipating writing this poem
since he was at least nineteen

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:22.575
years old.
He didn't even begin to fulfill

00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:26.202
what we can think of as his epic
promise until he was nearly

00:09:26.202 --> 00:09:29.143
fifty years old,
until he had actually lost the

00:09:29.143 --> 00:09:31.980
use of his eyes,
until he could no longer read,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.789
and until he could no longer
use a pen to write.

00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:43.636
Finally, Milton's poem is late
by virtue of the simple fact

00:09:43.636 --> 00:09:47.230
that it's written in the form of
an epic.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.820
An epic might have seemed
[laughs]

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.990
like a great idea when Milton
was nineteen,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.169
but by the time Milton gets
actually around to writing it,

00:09:54.169 --> 00:09:58.429
it's an entirely superannuated,
utterly outdated form.

00:09:58.429 --> 00:10:01.014
There's, of course,
the undeniable fact that the

00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:02.720
greatest epics,
The Iliad,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.168
The Odyssey,
and then The Aeneid,

00:10:05.168 --> 00:10:08.685
were all written in a
heroic literary past that would

00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:11.259
have struck anybody as
irrecoverable;

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:14.126
but even the modern practice of
epic writing,

00:10:14.126 --> 00:10:17.643
or romance epic writing,
had basically entirely fizzled

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:20.509
out by the end of the sixteenth
century,

00:10:20.509 --> 00:10:23.272
when the Italians I'm thinking
of, Tasso and Ariosto,

00:10:23.272 --> 00:10:26.064
were writing.
There had been a half century

00:10:26.064 --> 00:10:30.327
that had passed since any great
modern epic or romance epic had

00:10:30.327 --> 00:10:32.929
even been produced.
There would have been a

00:10:32.929 --> 00:10:35.014
prevailing sense,
and Milton has to have been

00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:38.289
sensitive to this,
that it was simply too late to

00:10:38.289 --> 00:10:41.480
write an epic of any kind on any
subject.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.006
Milton began his epic poem
late.It's in relation to all

00:10:46.006 --> 00:10:50.454
of these forms of lateness that
we can best understand the

00:10:50.454 --> 00:10:53.809
opening invocation of
Paradise Lost.

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:57.789
So look at the first lines
of the poem.

00:10:57.789 --> 00:11:02.700
This is page 211 in the
Hughes.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:07.436
Harold Bloom has written,
and I think he's absolutely

00:11:07.436 --> 00:11:11.835
right, that Milton begins
Paradise Lost with a

00:11:11.835 --> 00:11:15.049
powerful defense against
lateness.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.724
You can think of it as this
reaction to the problem of

00:11:17.724 --> 00:11:20.448
lateness that accounts for one
of the invocation's most

00:11:20.448 --> 00:11:23.396
distinctive features,
and that's the repetition of

00:11:23.396 --> 00:11:25.932
the word "first."
You actually have the word

00:11:25.932 --> 00:11:29.339
"first" appearing six times in
the first thirty-three lines of

00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:32.150
Paradise Lost.
We'll do a little catalog of

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.829
them: "Of Man's First
Disobedience and the Fruit" --

00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:36.509
that was line one,
of course.

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:40.019
Line eight: "That Shepherd,
who first taught the chosen

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:41.324
Seed..."
Line nineteen:

00:11:41.324 --> 00:11:43.429
"Thou from the first / wast
presentâ€¦"

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:46.495
Go down to line twenty-seven:
"Say first, for Heav'n hides

00:11:46.495 --> 00:11:48.637
nothing from thy view."
Line twenty-eight:

00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:51.227
"say first what cause."
And line thirty-three:

00:11:51.227 --> 00:11:54.419
"Who first seduc'd them to that
foul revolt?"

00:11:54.419 --> 00:11:59.177
Milton is alerting us to the
significance of the word "first"

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:02.922
in the very first line,
in this wonderful act of

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:07.328
violating the laws of iambic
pentameter.Now the rhythm of

00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:11.220
a true line of iambic pentameter
-- and there are,

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.392
of course, hundreds,
maybe thousands of such lines

00:12:14.392 --> 00:12:18.407
in this poem -- a true line of
iambic pentameter would run like

00:12:18.407 --> 00:12:19.969
this.
You know this:

00:12:19.969 --> 00:12:23.186
"da-DA-da-DA-da-
DA-da-DA-da-DA," an unaccented

00:12:23.186 --> 00:12:27.172
syllable followed by an accented
syllable, and that little

00:12:27.172 --> 00:12:31.569
pattern repeated five times.
With this iambic template in

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:35.672
mind, with this little paradigm
in our head, we may feel

00:12:35.672 --> 00:12:40.298
metrically constrained to read
the first line of this poem like

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:44.850
this: "Of Man's First
Disobedience,

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:51.150
and the Fruit" --
"da-DA-da-DA-da-DA..."

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:54.789
It sounds stupid.
It should sound stupid.

00:12:54.789 --> 00:12:59.295
It's impossible to get away
with such an awkward reading,

00:12:59.295 --> 00:13:04.363
but that's the reading that the
metrical form is pushing us into

00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:07.898
producing.
The problem with my awkward,

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:13.057
metrically proper reading of
that first line is that the word

00:13:13.057 --> 00:13:16.240
"first" insists on being
accented,

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:20.324
and it screws up the template:
"Of man's first

00:13:20.324 --> 00:13:22.759
disobedience,
and the fruit,"

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:26.543
and so Milton is rebelling
against an implicit law of

00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:29.889
poetic meter in the very first
line of what,

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:34.599
of course, we know will be this
extraordinarily self-conscious

00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:37.336
poem.
You could think of this as the

00:13:37.336 --> 00:13:41.876
poem's first -- by no means its
last -- its first act of poetic

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:46.343
disobedience.Now the word
"first" begins to take on a much

00:13:46.343 --> 00:13:51.029
bigger range of significances
than we might at first think.

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:53.720
When Milton instructs his muse,
"Say first, for Heav'n hides

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.435
nothing from thy view,"
there's something more here

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:59.821
than the primary sense of the
word, which is just "first in

00:13:59.821 --> 00:14:01.531
sequence."
Milton, of course,

00:14:01.531 --> 00:14:03.646
is instructing the muse to
explain first,

00:14:03.646 --> 00:14:06.290
before she gets around to
explaining anything else,

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.299
what caused Adam and Eve to
fall.

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:11.807
That's just the simple
sequential sense of "first," the

00:14:11.807 --> 00:14:15.120
first that comes before second,
third and fourth;

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.250
but there's something more
radical here than the ordinal or

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:21.616
sequential sense of "first."
"First" can also mean

00:14:21.616 --> 00:14:25.275
"earliest": Milton's describing
his muse now,

00:14:25.275 --> 00:14:29.600
at the present moment of the
writing of the poem,

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.283
to be the first one perhaps
ever to explain the cause of the

00:14:34.283 --> 00:14:38.490
Fall, to be the first to tell
the story of the loss of

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:43.010
paradise or,
I don't know -- to be the first

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:48.470
poet ever to write an epic poem.
Milton's constructing -- it's a

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.988
remarkable and impossible
strategy here,

00:14:50.988 --> 00:14:54.279
and it's one we can call a
strategy of retrospective

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.120
anticipation and it's a type
ofâ€¦

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.639
Of course, this retrospective
anticipation can only be a

00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:03.124
fiction.
One can never come before

00:15:03.124 --> 00:15:05.854
something that,
of course, has already

00:15:05.854 --> 00:15:09.912
happened, but this fiction of an
impossible firstness is

00:15:09.912 --> 00:15:13.970
something that Milton is working
very hard to accomplish

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.498
here.We know this.
Milton has already indulged

00:15:17.498 --> 00:15:20.223
this fantasy of coming before
something that's already

00:15:20.223 --> 00:15:23.226
happened.
We recognize this desire to

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:27.909
anticipate an already existing
narrative, from what?

00:15:27.909 --> 00:15:30.889
From Milton's first major poem,
the Nativity Ode.

00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:33.948
Milton directed the
heavenly muse in that poem,

00:15:33.948 --> 00:15:36.823
you'll remember,
to prevent -- to come before --

00:15:36.823 --> 00:15:40.432
the three wise men who were
hasting to the manger with their

00:15:40.432 --> 00:15:43.980
gold and their frankincense and
their myrrh: "O run,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.590
prevent them with thy humble
odeâ€¦

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.940
/ have thou the honour first,
thy Lord to greet."

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.913
I suggest that we can hear
echoes of that same youthful

00:15:54.913 --> 00:15:59.702
competitiveness in Milton's
first major poem in these

00:15:59.702 --> 00:16:03.389
opening lines,
in the beginning of the great

00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:07.923
epic of Milton's maturity.
Milton wants to write an epic

00:16:07.923 --> 00:16:11.844
that in some ways comes before,
or prevents,

00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:15.399
the great epics of Homer and
Virgil.

00:16:15.399 --> 00:16:21.615
It's safe to say that this is
no easy feat.As presumptuous

00:16:21.615 --> 00:16:24.570
[laughs]
as that desire is,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.061
to come before Homer or to come
before Virgil,

00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.000
it's by no means the final
sense,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.500
I think, of Milton's ambitious
drive to be first.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:36.111
Milton invokes the same
heavenly muse here who inspired

00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:39.147
Moses, that shepherd.
Look at line eight:

00:16:39.147 --> 00:16:43.010
Moses, "that shepherd,
who first taught the chosen

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.907
Seed."
It's almost as if -- could this

00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:48.213
be?
It's almost as if Milton wants

00:16:48.213 --> 00:16:52.124
to narrate the events of the
Creation and the Fall with the

00:16:52.124 --> 00:16:54.889
same kind of firstness that
Moses did.

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:56.691
Milton would,
of course, have assumed that it

00:16:56.691 --> 00:16:59.230
was Moses who had written the
first five books of the Bible,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.438
the Pentateuch,
and to prevent,

00:17:02.438 --> 00:17:08.856
or come, before Moses is an act
of prevention or anticipation

00:17:08.856 --> 00:17:15.060
far more dangerous than mere
literary competitiveness.

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:19.661
What's Milton doing here?
We could see him as actually

00:17:19.661 --> 00:17:24.256
vying with scripture.
Implicit in this invocation is

00:17:24.256 --> 00:17:29.168
a truly remarkable claim that
this poem is the product of the

00:17:29.168 --> 00:17:33.671
same divine authority that had
informed and inspired the

00:17:33.671 --> 00:17:38.125
writing of the Holy Bible.
Sing Heav'nly Muse,

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:41.727
that on the secret top Of
Oreb, or of Sinai,

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:44.410
didst inspire That
Shepherd,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:48.355
who first taught the chosen
Seed, In the Beginning how

00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:51.332
the Heav'ns and Earth Rose
out of Chaos:

00:17:51.332 --> 00:17:54.240
Or if Sion Hill Delight
thee more,

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.787
and Siloa's Brook that
flow'd Fast by the Oracle of

00:17:56.787 --> 00:17:59.704
God;
I thence  Invoke thy aid to

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:05.328
my advent'rous Song...
Now Milton doesn't want simply

00:18:05.328 --> 00:18:09.750
to be an epic poet like Homer
and Virgil.

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.880
That's -- no sweat with that
one!

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.866
Milton wants to be a divine
prophet like one of the great

00:18:15.866 --> 00:18:18.430
Hebrew poets of the Old
Testament.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.137
This is why he's continually
placing the imaginative origin

00:18:22.137 --> 00:18:24.950
of the poem back to the very
dawn of time,

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.200
perhaps even back before -- if
you can imagine such a time --

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.471
before the very dawn of time.
Milton wants to create the

00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:34.960
illusion that he's predicting,
or that he's prophesying,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.386
the actions recounted in the
poem, as if Milton were

00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:40.049
prophesying what of course we
know to be already past.

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:42.811
This is the strategy of
retrospective

00:18:42.811 --> 00:18:47.491
anticipation.Now Milton can
make this implicit claim for a

00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:51.941
prophecy because he's being
inspired by none other than the

00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:56.084
divine spirit that had inspired
Moses to sing of divine

00:18:56.084 --> 00:19:00.610
creation: "how the Heav'ns and
Earth / rose out of Chaos" --

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.140
this is already an outrageous
claim,

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.400
but Milton dares to go even
further.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.491
Not only is this the same muse
who had inspired Moses to write

00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:14.354
about the Creation,
this heavenly spirit was

00:19:14.354 --> 00:19:17.020
actually present at the moment
of creation.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.781
Look at line seventeen: 
And chiefly Thou O

00:19:20.781 --> 00:19:24.846
Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all Temples th' upright

00:19:24.846 --> 00:19:28.559
heart and pure, Instruct me,
for Thou know'st;

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:32.132
Thou from the first Wast
present, and with mighty wings

00:19:32.132 --> 00:19:35.766
outspread Dove-like satst
brooding on the vast Abyss

00:19:35.766 --> 00:19:38.230
And mad'st it
pregnantâ€¦

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:42.392
Of all of the appearances of
the word "first" in these

00:19:42.392 --> 00:19:45.926
opening lines,
this is the "first" that has to

00:19:45.926 --> 00:19:50.675
bear the most weight.
The spirit to whom Milton is

00:19:50.675 --> 00:19:56.546
praying was the actual vehicle
through which God created the

00:19:56.546 --> 00:19:59.896
universe.
This is the spirit through whom

00:19:59.896 --> 00:20:02.539
God fashioned the world out of
chaos.

00:20:02.539 --> 00:20:06.245
This is the spirit that Moses
says, in the first Book of

00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:10.152
Genesis, that moved upon the
face of the waters at the time

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:13.231
of creation.
Milton goes beyond the image of

00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:15.943
this creation,
this creative power provided

00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:19.430
for us by the King James
translation of the Bible or by

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.240
any English translation of the
Bible in Milton's time.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.622
He looks back even further.
Milton goes back to the Latin

00:20:27.622 --> 00:20:32.107
version of the Bible which
translates the Hebrew word for

00:20:32.107 --> 00:20:34.990
moved as
incubabat.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:40.232
That's Jerome's translation.
Incubate is the strange

00:20:40.232 --> 00:20:44.873
Latin word, and it's a verb --
of course, as we know -- it's a

00:20:44.873 --> 00:20:48.982
verb typically used with
relation not to spirits but to

00:20:48.982 --> 00:20:52.277
gestating birds,
and it literally means "to

00:20:52.277 --> 00:20:54.520
brood."
To incubate means to

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.579
brood or to sit on one's eggs
until they hatch.

00:20:57.579 --> 00:21:02.567
And so Milton's Holy Spirit,
the creative force behind the

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:06.417
entire universe,
actually sat brooding on the

00:21:06.417 --> 00:21:09.887
vast abyss,
sitting on the waters of chaos

00:21:09.887 --> 00:21:14.202
just as a mother dove might sit
on her eggs.Think of what

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:17.460
Milton's asking us of here.
He's asking a lot.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:22.145
He's asking us to imagine God,
or perhaps this is God's

00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:26.137
creative spirit,
as some sort of feminine being

00:21:26.137 --> 00:21:31.343
laying the universal egg and
brooding over it until it bursts

00:21:31.343 --> 00:21:34.200
forth with new life.
This is a risk.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.712
Milton's treading an
extraordinarily fine line

00:21:36.712 --> 00:21:39.279
between the tremendous beauty of
this image,

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:43.714
on the one hand,
and its potential impiety or

00:21:43.714 --> 00:21:48.828
just grotesquery on the other.
No sooner has Milton conjured

00:21:48.828 --> 00:21:52.800
this already unbelievable image
of a kind of maternal creation

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.447
than he reverses all of the
gendered categories that he's

00:21:56.447 --> 00:21:59.842
just established.
He adds to this image that is

00:21:59.842 --> 00:22:03.969
perfectly, sufficiently filled
with grotesquery as it is -- he

00:22:03.969 --> 00:22:07.420
adds this next phrase:
"and mad'st it pregnant."

00:22:15.019 --> 00:22:21.358
How do we even begin to
appreciate this amazing imagery

00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:24.242
here?
In portraying the deity,

00:22:24.242 --> 00:22:28.110
I would think,
if I were to write an epic poem

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:33.096
-- I would feel that I would be
expected to stay within the

00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:37.480
fairly narrow parameters of
religious decorum.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.799
Milton had no precedent for
this.

00:22:39.799 --> 00:22:43.807
There's no precedent for this
depiction of a god or a holy

00:22:43.807 --> 00:22:46.829
spirit as a kind of
hermaphroditic being.

00:22:46.829 --> 00:22:50.593
I think it's safe to say that
we're intended to be shocked,

00:22:50.593 --> 00:22:53.837
maybe even repulsed,
by this remarkable description

00:22:53.837 --> 00:22:56.821
of the deity;
and so I'm hoping you feel

00:22:56.821 --> 00:23:01.380
something of a shock of these
lines, "and mad'st it pregnant."

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.164
Milton is taking a huge
aesthetic risk here.Whatever

00:23:05.164 --> 00:23:07.984
you're reading,
it's always worth thinking

00:23:07.984 --> 00:23:11.769
about and considering what the
motives might be for such

00:23:11.769 --> 00:23:14.589
extraordinary literary risk
taking.

00:23:14.589 --> 00:23:20.325
This image of the curious
process by which the heavenly

00:23:20.325 --> 00:23:27.230
spirit creates the universe is
absolutely central to this poem,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:30.109
and it's central to the poem
for two reasons.

00:23:30.109 --> 00:23:34.096
It's central to Milton's
theological vision that will

00:23:34.096 --> 00:23:37.470
soon establish itself throughout
the poem,

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.930
and it's also,
I think, central to his poetic

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:45.019
vision, his vision of what a
poem is or should be.

00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:49.830
This shocking image,
this impossible-to-imagine

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:53.490
image of a brooding
impregnation,

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.568
establishes the foundation for
two of this poem's most daring

00:23:58.568 --> 00:24:01.481
elements.
The first is the radical

00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:06.268
theology, and the second is this
poem's equally radical and

00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:11.056
equally daring original verse
form.Let's take the first

00:24:11.056 --> 00:24:16.380
thing first,
the radical theology.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:19.753
I'm only able to talk about a
small component of Milton's

00:24:19.753 --> 00:24:22.587
theological daring here.
It's with this image of a

00:24:22.587 --> 00:24:25.528
brooding impregnation that
Milton announces the presence in

00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:28.900
his poem of his most potent,
what I think is the most

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:33.099
interesting, theological
innovation that he comes up with

00:24:33.099 --> 00:24:35.502
here.
It seems to be the case that

00:24:35.502 --> 00:24:38.849
Milton rather late in his life
has become a monist.

00:24:38.849 --> 00:24:43.923
He embraces the heterodox idea
of monism, sometimes called

00:24:43.923 --> 00:24:49.633
animist materialism or vitalism,
which is essentially a denial

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:54.259
of any distinction between the
body and the soul.

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:57.780
The principle of monism had
just introduced itself in

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:01.487
England around the mid-1640s,
around, it's been argued,

00:25:01.487 --> 00:25:04.829
the time that Milton's writing
Areopagitica,

00:25:04.829 --> 00:25:08.599
and it met with all sorts of
opposition.

00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:11.938
Orthodox scientists,
orthodox Christians -- everyone

00:25:11.938 --> 00:25:15.079
agreed in the seventeenth
century that matter,

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:19.371
or substance or body,
was entirely separate from and

00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:23.917
distinct from the immaterial,
the incorporeal,

00:25:23.917 --> 00:25:29.329
stuff called spirit or soul.
So orthodoxy is definitively

00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:32.792
dualist.
There are two types of stuff

00:25:32.792 --> 00:25:37.579
[laughs]: immaterial stuff and
matter or body;

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:40.175
but Milton insisted that
there's no such thing as an

00:25:40.175 --> 00:25:42.568
immaterial spirit,
that that was a contradiction

00:25:42.568 --> 00:25:46.134
in terms.
Everything that we call soul or

00:25:46.134 --> 00:25:51.099
spirit, even God himself,
for John Milton is bodily.

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:55.217
Spirit is merely a kind of
bodily form of energy,

00:25:55.217 --> 00:26:00.020
and God at the beginning of
time infused this energy into

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:04.824
the entirety of the material
world at the Creation.So

00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:08.511
physical life,
physical matter,

00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:14.549
for the mature Milton is never
lifeless or dead.

00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:16.996
All matter contains within it
something like a "potency of

00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:18.119
life";
that's Milton's phrase.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:21.825
It has a capacity for action,
actually a capacity for motion,

00:26:21.825 --> 00:26:25.037
and, just as books can take on
a life of their own in

00:26:25.037 --> 00:26:31.059
Areopagitica,
so all matter for later Milton.

00:26:31.059 --> 00:26:34.662
Even what we think in our
vulgar ways to be inanimate

00:26:34.662 --> 00:26:38.750
objects -- even they seem to
have within them something like

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.385
a potency,
a potency of life or an

00:26:41.385 --> 00:26:46.183
infusion of divine spirit.
Of course, the human body is

00:26:46.183 --> 00:26:51.769
the supreme example of the
spiritually infused corporeal

00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:56.349
substance.
It's infused with divine spirit.

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:58.990
And this is a huge problem in
the seventeenth century.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.902
Milton's contemporaries were
endlessly conjecturing where it

00:27:02.902 --> 00:27:06.019
is exactly in the body that the
soul resides.

00:27:06.019 --> 00:27:08.785
Some of you may know that
Descartes, the great French

00:27:08.785 --> 00:27:11.710
philosopher and Milton's
slightly older contemporary,

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:17.380
had decided that the soul
resided in the pineal gland of

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:23.256
the body, the soul managed
[laughs]to govern the body from

00:27:23.256 --> 00:27:27.085
this tiny,
little place in the -- where is

00:27:27.085 --> 00:27:29.868
the pineal gland?
I think it's in your brain,

00:27:29.868 --> 00:27:33.710
the back of your head.
Thank you.

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:39.935
Keep that in mind.The soul
for Milton though isn't distinct

00:27:39.935 --> 00:27:43.190
from body.
It is the body.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.258
The soul infused its power
throughout the entirety of the

00:27:46.258 --> 00:27:48.231
bodily frame,
and so body and soul in

00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:52.291
Milton's incredibly moving,
and I think really beautiful,

00:27:52.291 --> 00:27:55.630
vision almost becomes
indistinguishable.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.158
All of this monistic
philosophy, I think,

00:27:58.158 --> 00:28:01.761
is implicit in the image of
divinity's impregnation of the

00:28:01.761 --> 00:28:04.252
vast abyss.
Milton's God doesn't,

00:28:04.252 --> 00:28:08.217
as we learn from Genesis,
doesn't fashion the matter of

00:28:08.217 --> 00:28:11.853
chaos with his hands.
He impregnates it with spirit,

00:28:11.853 --> 00:28:14.039
and he gives it a potency of
life.

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:18.165
As you'll see in Book Seven,
the book of the Creation,

00:28:18.165 --> 00:28:22.368
he gives it a liberty to
organize itself into the order

00:28:22.368 --> 00:28:26.650
of the created world -- a
freedom to create itself.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.796
That's one consequence of
Milton's image of a brooding

00:28:30.796 --> 00:28:35.100
impregnation.There's a
second type of potency that's

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.230
also established in with this
image,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:42.583
and that's the potency of the
kind of verse that Milton is

00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:46.443
writing in Paradise Lost.
It's been argued,

00:28:46.443 --> 00:28:50.976
and I think there's something
to this, that Milton's monism is

00:28:50.976 --> 00:28:54.990
closely connected to his
implicit theory of poetry.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:00.296
There's no question that the
shock experienced by the first

00:29:00.296 --> 00:29:05.876
readers of Paradise Lost
had next to nothing to do with

00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:10.706
the content of this poem,
which might strike us as

00:29:10.706 --> 00:29:14.653
shocking in itself.
We would think that Milton's

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:19.378
contemporaries might be aghast
that such a sympathetic portrait

00:29:19.378 --> 00:29:23.569
of Satan could be used at the
beginning of the poem.

00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:27.852
No, the most immediately
shocking aspect of the poem was

00:29:27.852 --> 00:29:32.367
its style, and we have to look
at the actual poetic form by

00:29:32.367 --> 00:29:36.727
which this poem is constructed
because the poetic form is

00:29:36.727 --> 00:29:39.920
absolutely integral to its
meaning.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.959
If you're not taking notes in
this lecture,

00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:46.359
you have to write down at least
one sentence.

00:29:46.359 --> 00:29:50.300
You must write this down
because this will be the most

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:54.314
important thing I say all
morning: Milton's Paradise

00:29:54.314 --> 00:29:58.626
Lost is the first narrative
poem in English that didn't

00:29:58.626 --> 00:30:02.938
rhyme.Milton wrote his epic
in lines of unrhymed iambic

00:30:02.938 --> 00:30:07.177
pentameter or what we call,
and what Milton would have

00:30:07.177 --> 00:30:10.701
called, blank verse.
Up to this point in literary

00:30:10.701 --> 00:30:15.575
history, only verse written for
the theater had been written in

00:30:15.575 --> 00:30:19.900
unrhymed lines of iambic
pentameter, in blank verse.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.797
This is the verse form,
you'll recognize it,

00:30:22.797 --> 00:30:26.840
in so many of the long speeches
of characters in the plays of

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:30.270
Marlowe and of Shakespeare.
Those are plays though,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.067
and all English narrative
poems, including all of

00:30:33.067 --> 00:30:37.602
Shakespeare's narrative poems,
they had all been written in

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:42.361
rhyme, either long verse
paragraphs of rhymed heroic

00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:46.559
couplets or in intricately
rhymed stanzas.

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:51.219
For most readers in Milton's
time, rhyme was actually

00:30:51.219 --> 00:30:55.337
constitutive of poetry,
and Milton's lines of unrhymed

00:30:55.337 --> 00:30:58.529
verse here may well have not
seemed poetry at all.

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:02.978
It was shocking.There seems
to have been something of a kind

00:31:02.978 --> 00:31:06.650
of outcry about the style of
Paradise Lost.

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:10.088
Look at page 210 in the
Hughes. It's in response

00:31:10.088 --> 00:31:13.846
to what seems to have been an
aesthetic reaction to the poem

00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:17.539
that the printer of Paradise
Lost asked Milton,

00:31:17.539 --> 00:31:21.729
went back to Milton and asked
him to append a note to the

00:31:21.729 --> 00:31:26.144
book's second printing -- to
append a note that explains why

00:31:26.144 --> 00:31:29.006
the poem rhymes not.
People can't deal with this

00:31:29.006 --> 00:31:31.338
poem until they [laughs]can get
a handle on the fact that it

00:31:31.338 --> 00:31:34.783
doesn't rhyme.
So Milton writes this and adds

00:31:34.783 --> 00:31:38.850
it, appends it,
to all subsequent editions of

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:41.569
the poem.
This is what Milton tells us: 

00:31:41.569 --> 00:31:45.288
The measure is English
Heroic Verse without Rime,

00:31:45.288 --> 00:31:48.869
as that of Homer in Greek,
and of Virgil in Latin;

00:31:48.869 --> 00:31:53.547
Rime being no necessary Adjunct
or true Ornament of Poem or good

00:31:53.547 --> 00:31:56.220
Verse, in longer Works
especially,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.822
but the Invention [and this is
so familiarly Miltonic]

00:32:00.822 --> 00:32:05.077
of a barbarous Age,
to set off wretched matter and

00:32:05.077 --> 00:32:08.575
lame Meter;
grac't indeed since by the use

00:32:08.575 --> 00:32:12.819
of some famous modern Poets,
[okay, Spenser might have done

00:32:12.819 --> 00:32:15.397
it kind of well,
the whole rhyme-thing,

00:32:15.397 --> 00:32:17.395
but nonetheless,
the modern poets are]

00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:20.646
carried away by Custom,
but much to their own vexation,

00:32:20.646 --> 00:32:24.220
hindrance, and constraint to
express many things otherwise,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.795
and for the most part worse
than they else would have

00:32:27.795 --> 00:32:30.836
exprest them.
Milton brings to his critique

00:32:30.836 --> 00:32:33.754
of rhyme that same -- and this
is familiar -- the same

00:32:33.754 --> 00:32:36.837
political rhetoric that he had
brought to his critique of

00:32:36.837 --> 00:32:39.039
monarchy in the regicide
treatises.

00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:43.424
You can also hear Satan's
critique of the tyranny of

00:32:43.424 --> 00:32:47.380
heaven in this account of the
rhyme as well.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.200
Like kingship,
rhyme is a custom.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.410
It's an invention of a
barbarous age which a blind and

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.802
ignorant population will accept
only to its own vexation,

00:32:56.802 --> 00:33:00.418
hindrance, and constraint.
It's always Milton's duty --

00:33:00.418 --> 00:33:03.500
this is the reason that he was
put on this earth:

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.289
to liberate a people from any
such constraining customs.

00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:10.839
It's the rhetoric of liberation
that -- this is the rhetoric

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:14.569
that permeates all of Milton's
political prose.While Milton

00:33:14.569 --> 00:33:18.058
decided against writing an
explicitly political nationalist

00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:20.716
poem,
he did see himself as writing a

00:33:20.716 --> 00:33:24.130
poem that performed some kind of
political function.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.273
It performed its revolutionary
function in a much more subtle,

00:33:27.273 --> 00:33:29.849
though, and a much more
insinuating kind of way.

00:33:29.849 --> 00:33:31.981
And so at the end of this note
on the verse Milton claims that

00:33:31.981 --> 00:33:33.910
Paradise Lost:
â€¦

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:38.040
is to be esteem'd an example
set, the first in English

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.677
[another important first],
of ancient liberty recover'd to

00:33:42.677 --> 00:33:46.742
Heroic Poem from the troublesome
and modern bondage of

00:33:46.742 --> 00:33:51.740
Riming.
It's a wonderful metaphor.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.386
It's as if Milton is thinking
of the poem as if it were a

00:33:55.386 --> 00:33:59.489
human body, and the rhyme words
at the end of the typical heroic

00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:02.809
couplet -- the two lines that
rhyme at the end,

00:34:02.809 --> 00:34:07.471
and then another two lines with
a different rhyme at the end of

00:34:07.471 --> 00:34:11.681
those two lines -- these lined
rhymes of the poems by his

00:34:11.681 --> 00:34:15.252
contemporaries,
his competitors:

00:34:15.252 --> 00:34:20.340
the rhyme words function as
shackles.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.610
I think that's the image here.
They're manacles that confine

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:27.660
the otherwise vulnerable and
tender flesh of the body of the

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:30.408
poem.
Rhymes are barbarous forms of

00:34:30.408 --> 00:34:35.183
constraint that impinge upon the
true freedom of the body of the

00:34:35.183 --> 00:34:37.361
poem.
Milton explains here in the

00:34:37.361 --> 00:34:40.678
middle of the note that's why
other cultures have rejected

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.105
rhyme:
â€¦

00:34:42.105 --> 00:34:44.703
as a thing of itself,
to all judicious ears,

00:34:44.703 --> 00:34:47.239
trivial and of no true musical
delight;

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:50.723
which consists only [true
musical delight consists only]

00:34:50.723 --> 00:34:53.510
in apt Numbers,
fit quantity of Syllables,

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:57.283
and the sense variously drawn
out from one Verse into another,

00:34:57.283 --> 00:35:00.500
not in the jingling sound of
like endings...

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.895
So Milton refuses to force his
poem to make sense through the

00:35:03.895 --> 00:35:07.700
barbarous mechanics of rhyme,
which for Milton reduces all of

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.139
the spirit, all of the life of a
poem or of a line,

00:35:11.139 --> 00:35:15.599
simply to that jingling sound
at the end of the line.

00:35:15.599 --> 00:35:19.944
And so in Milton's verse here,
sense or meaning is variously

00:35:19.944 --> 00:35:22.889
drawn out from one verse into
another.

00:35:22.889 --> 00:35:26.904
Sense, the very spirit of
meaning, is infused throughout

00:35:26.904 --> 00:35:31.284
an entire line rather than being
singled out and separated or

00:35:31.284 --> 00:35:35.444
segregated to the end of the
line in the form of the rhyme

00:35:35.444 --> 00:35:39.678
word.Sense in Milton's
poetry functions a lot like soul

00:35:39.678 --> 00:35:42.889
or spirit does in Milton's
theology,

00:35:42.889 --> 00:35:46.169
and so Milton's note on the
verse clues us into this

00:35:46.169 --> 00:35:50.349
intimate connection between his
radical poetics of blank verse,

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:53.869
on the one hand,
and his radical theology of

00:35:53.869 --> 00:35:57.368
monism on the other.
You can see from the handout

00:35:57.368 --> 00:36:00.826
that I've given you -- I hope
you can see from the handout

00:36:00.826 --> 00:36:04.588
that I've given you a quotation
here from Milton's Christian

00:36:04.588 --> 00:36:08.205
Doctrine,
yes, in which Milton describes

00:36:08.205 --> 00:36:13.508
the process whereby God actually
impregnates the human body with

00:36:13.508 --> 00:36:18.389
soul: "Nor did God merely
breathe that spirit into man,

00:36:18.389 --> 00:36:21.957
but moulded it in each
individual and infused it

00:36:21.957 --> 00:36:24.985
throughout."
The divine soul is everywhere

00:36:24.985 --> 00:36:27.559
in the Miltonic body,
the human body.

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:32.110
Of course, that means that all
human acts are sanctioned by God

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.900
including -- maybe most
importantly,

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:39.687
the sexual act is given the
highest form of divine approval

00:36:39.687 --> 00:36:42.882
imaginable.
Milton wants us to think of the

00:36:42.882 --> 00:36:46.099
sense of his verse as being
similarly infused;

00:36:46.099 --> 00:36:50.719
the poem is similarly infused
throughout with some kind of

00:36:50.719 --> 00:36:55.500
soul or spirit or divine energy
throughout the entirety of a

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.795
verse paragraph.Milton
refuses in Paradise Lost

00:36:59.795 --> 00:37:05.134
to constrain a thought,
or to confine it,

00:37:05.134 --> 00:37:12.570
to a grammatical unit of sense.
A grammatical unit of sense is

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.119
never identical to a line in
Milton's poem.

00:37:16.119 --> 00:37:21.090
Sense doesn't simply end at the
end of a ten-syllable line.

00:37:21.090 --> 00:37:27.646
Now most rhymed poems in
Milton's day were end-stopped

00:37:27.646 --> 00:37:31.793
lines of verse.
An end-stopped line is one in

00:37:31.793 --> 00:37:36.092
which the grammatical unit of
sense stops precisely at the end

00:37:36.092 --> 00:37:38.860
of the line.
The next line of verse picks up

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.452
a different thought and the next
one after that,

00:37:41.452 --> 00:37:43.508
and so on.
You can actually see the

00:37:43.508 --> 00:37:46.688
mechanics of end-stopped verse
quite clearly in the rhymed

00:37:46.688 --> 00:37:48.920
version of Paradise Lost
that,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.960
admittedly, the great poet John
Dryden wrote.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.119
This was supposed to be the
libretto for an opera.

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:57.410
Dryden seems to have gotten
permission from the old,

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.830
blind poet Milton himself
because Dryden felt that the

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:04.508
public had an interest in
reading Paradise Lost but

00:38:04.508 --> 00:38:08.380
they couldn't deal with the fact
that it didn't rhyme;

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.184
so Dryden set out on this
remarkable project of making the

00:38:12.184 --> 00:38:14.988
whole thing rhyme,
and I invite you to read

00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:17.489
Dryden's efforts.
They're really quite remarkable.

00:38:17.489 --> 00:38:21.420
It's not unlike what the Turner
Broadcasting Network does with

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.836
old movies, colorizing them in
order to make them more

00:38:24.836 --> 00:38:28.187
palatable to a modern
audience.You'll notice that

00:38:28.187 --> 00:38:31.924
every line of the passage from
Dryden here concludes with a

00:38:31.924 --> 00:38:35.476
comma or a period,
because every line constitutes

00:38:35.476 --> 00:38:37.789
its own syntactical unit of
meaning.

00:38:37.789 --> 00:38:41.340
Milton's poem -- this is a
statistical fact,

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:45.963
I don't know who came up with
it -- Milton's poem has far

00:38:45.963 --> 00:38:51.000
fewer end-stopped lines than the
verse of any other poet.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.534
Milton's lines,
we say, are enjambed:

00:38:53.534 --> 00:38:57.264
they run in to one another,
and a syntactical unit for

00:38:57.264 --> 00:39:00.010
Milton is continually spilling
out.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.720
It's bursting out of the line
and infusing itself into the

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.300
next line, and then into the
next, and into the next.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.884
I don't know who came up with
this statistic but I love it:

00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:14.284
nearly three out of every five
lines in Paradise Lost

00:39:14.284 --> 00:39:18.239
are enjambed -- they embrace
the practice of enjambment.

00:39:18.239 --> 00:39:22.423
The meaning or the sense of a
verse paragraph is diffused

00:39:22.423 --> 00:39:26.687
throughout a series of lines.
I think that Milton intends for

00:39:26.687 --> 00:39:30.016
us to think of the verse in
Paradise Lost as he

00:39:30.016 --> 00:39:33.157
wanted us to think of books in
Areopagitica:

00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:37.239
the lines of Milton's poetry
are not absolutely dead things,

00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:42.033
but they do contain within them
a potency of life.So Milton

00:39:42.033 --> 00:39:46.439
imagined that his own verse was
to be read and experienced

00:39:46.439 --> 00:39:50.239
something like a body.
Of course, it's a body that

00:39:50.239 --> 00:39:53.883
enjoys an extraordinary degree
of freedom, and this is a

00:39:53.883 --> 00:39:57.859
freedom that's infused into the
Creation when the Holy Spirit

00:39:57.859 --> 00:40:01.448
impregnates the vast abyss.
This is also the freedom

00:40:01.448 --> 00:40:04.448
enjoyed by surely,
hands down, the most remarkable

00:40:04.448 --> 00:40:07.875
of all of Milton's corporeal
creatures, and those are the

00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:10.901
angels.
I imagine it sounds strange to

00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:15.636
hear that Milton is asking us in
some way to think of the lines

00:40:15.636 --> 00:40:19.760
of his poetry as if they were
the bodies of angels,

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.469
but the notion of corporeal
freedom is so central to Milton

00:40:23.469 --> 00:40:27.498
that it actually makes sense in
some ways that Milton would want

00:40:27.498 --> 00:40:31.015
to attribute it to all of the
most original and the most

00:40:31.015 --> 00:40:35.164
daring elements of his poem.
This is an argument that's been

00:40:35.164 --> 00:40:38.413
developed really quite
brilliantly by a great Milton

00:40:38.413 --> 00:40:41.595
critic,
William Kerrigan.A lot of

00:40:41.595 --> 00:40:44.668
Book One is given over,
as you know,

00:40:44.668 --> 00:40:49.496
to those magnificent catalogs
of the names of the fallen

00:40:49.496 --> 00:40:52.920
angels as Milton names the
demons,

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:56.023
the fallen angels,
and catalogs the names that

00:40:56.023 --> 00:41:00.368
they assumed when they ascended
to earth and took on the form of

00:41:00.368 --> 00:41:05.300
pagan deities.
Look at line 423 in Book One.

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:13.011
I'll bet you,
even if you're reading this for

00:41:13.011 --> 00:41:15.992
the second or the third time,
you were surprised again when

00:41:15.992 --> 00:41:19.259
you came to this point.
Milton's been noting that some

00:41:19.259 --> 00:41:23.019
of the pagan deities that the
fallen angels eventually became

00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:26.998
were male and some were female.
It's here that Milton for no

00:41:26.998 --> 00:41:29.177
[laughs]
explicit, or no apparent,

00:41:29.177 --> 00:41:33.336
reason at all -- it's here that
he provides a little theoretical

00:41:33.336 --> 00:41:37.429
digression on the stunning
flexibility of angelic bodies.

00:41:37.429 --> 00:41:40.630
In the context it is a little
gratuitous.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.570
Line 423: 
For Spirits when they

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:46.469
please Can either Sex
assume, or both;

00:41:46.469 --> 00:41:51.188
so soft And uncompounded is
thir Essence pure, Not ti'd

00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:55.444
or manacl'd with joint or limb,
 Nor founded on the brittle

00:41:55.444 --> 00:41:57.920
strength of bones, Like
cumbrous flesh;

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.206
but in what shape they
choose, Dilated or

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:04.865
condens't, bright or
obscure, Can execute thir

00:42:04.865 --> 00:42:08.585
aery purposes,
 And works of love or

00:42:08.585 --> 00:42:11.845
enmity fulfil.
Clearly, the angels have bodies

00:42:11.845 --> 00:42:14.164
here.
They're made of matter just as

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:16.930
human beings are,
but their bodies aren't

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.420
compounded of separable
elements.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.780
They don't have joints and
limbs or organs or flesh.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:27.821
They're nothing but a strangely
embodied form of pure spirit,

00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:31.603
corporeal spirit:
a spirit that's been infused

00:42:31.603 --> 00:42:36.561
through a loosely circumscribed
shape.Now we learn later

00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:41.939
that the fact that these spirits
can "either Sex assume" actually

00:42:41.939 --> 00:42:46.660
comes in rather handy,
as the angels are permitted to

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.548
experience a form of sexual
union that far exceeds the

00:42:50.548 --> 00:42:55.389
miserable coition that creatures
like us are forced to perform,

00:42:55.389 --> 00:42:58.398
the coition "founded on the
brittle strength of bones,"

00:42:58.398 --> 00:43:02.545
Milton writes.
Milton's angels in an act of

00:43:02.545 --> 00:43:07.429
sexual union are fully smooshed
together.

00:43:07.429 --> 00:43:10.772
They are un-individuated,
if that makes any sense,

00:43:10.772 --> 00:43:15.455
in the act of sexual union.
There is the unutterable sexual

00:43:15.455 --> 00:43:19.994
rush that can only come about
through total corporeal

00:43:19.994 --> 00:43:25.230
enjambment.Now this little
discussion that Milton's given

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:29.420
us here on the ambisexuality of
his angels,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.117
not unlike perhaps the
ambisexuality of his God,

00:43:32.117 --> 00:43:35.561
seems to have little to do with
the discussion at hand of the

00:43:35.561 --> 00:43:38.253
heathen deities,
but I think it has everything

00:43:38.253 --> 00:43:41.019
to do with Milton's
understanding of his own verse,

00:43:41.019 --> 00:43:44.185
which he has freed from the
bondage of rhyming just as

00:43:44.185 --> 00:43:47.590
angels are freed from the
manacles of joints and limbs.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.981
Milton's not only writing in a
poetic style that he thinks is

00:43:50.981 --> 00:43:53.920
politically motivated and
ideologically motivated,

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.466
and he is doing that,
but the style of Paradise

00:43:57.466 --> 00:44:01.230
Lost is also powerfully
eroticized for Milton.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:05.776
In its amazing malleability of
form, having dismissed the

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:09.430
manacle of rhyme,
the poem is teeming with the

00:44:09.430 --> 00:44:12.840
same kind of erotic energy --
this is,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.951
I think, Milton's fantasy for
the poem -- the same energies

00:44:16.951 --> 00:44:21.204
that charge that image of books
in Areopagitica.So

00:44:21.204 --> 00:44:25.670
let's look at an example of how
this might actually happen,

00:44:28.989 --> 00:44:31.791
a way in which the verse
actually seems to generate this

00:44:31.791 --> 00:44:35.575
sensation of bodily freedom.
Just look at the first line of

00:44:35.575 --> 00:44:39.710
the poem: "Of Man's First
Disobedience and the Fruit."

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:44.243
We think at first,
because before we read this

00:44:44.243 --> 00:44:50.389
poem we were so used to reading
end-stopped lines of verse,

00:44:50.389 --> 00:44:55.238
like the lines of verse that
all of Milton's contemporaries

00:44:55.238 --> 00:44:59.828
were disgorging -- we assume,
I think, after the first line

00:44:59.828 --> 00:45:02.860
that the line should be
pronounced like this:

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:06.237
"Of Man's First Disobedience
and the Fruit" -- and

00:45:06.237 --> 00:45:09.184
implicitly,
"of the fruit of the

00:45:09.184 --> 00:45:13.056
Disobedience," as if the line
was actually:

00:45:13.056 --> 00:45:17.389
"Of Man's First Disobedience
and its Fruit,"

00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:18.550
meaning the fruit of the
disobedience.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:23.633
We read "fruit" naturally,
here, as if it meant "result"

00:45:23.633 --> 00:45:26.821
or "consequence."
We don't find this out until we

00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:29.176
get to the next line,
that the "fruit" at the end of

00:45:29.176 --> 00:45:31.670
the line is only a kind of
temporary resting place.

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:36.822
It's a provisional ending.
It's not a rhyme word,

00:45:36.822 --> 00:45:40.448
and so it doesn't constitute
the end of a unit of sense as a

00:45:40.448 --> 00:45:44.135
rhyme word would in most heroic
couplets.The sense of the

00:45:44.135 --> 00:45:46.840
sentence pushes us on to the
next line,

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:50.625
which alters our view of the
meaning of the word "fruit:":

00:45:50.625 --> 00:45:54.011
"Of Man's First Disobedience
and the Fruit / of that

00:45:54.011 --> 00:45:56.610
Forbidden Tree."
The word isn't figurative.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:46:00.459
It turns out to be literal,
real fruit, and we realize now

00:46:00.459 --> 00:46:04.309
that we've only partially
understood the sense of the word

00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:07.249
"fruit."
The combination of our readerly

00:46:07.249 --> 00:46:11.438
experience of these two lines --
first, the figurative reading

00:46:11.438 --> 00:46:15.559
that comes from our habits of
reading end-stopped verses,

00:46:15.559 --> 00:46:19.600
and now the literal meaning of
"fruit" that comes from this

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.571
newly acquired habit of reading
enjambed lines -- it's the

00:46:23.571 --> 00:46:27.193
experience of both of these
cognitive sensations that

00:46:27.193 --> 00:46:30.815
provides us with a true
signifying experience of what

00:46:30.815 --> 00:46:34.090
Milton can do with a word like
"fruit,"

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.008
which is obviously going to be
a loaded one in the

00:46:37.008 --> 00:46:40.284
poem.Look at another
instance of the malleability of

00:46:40.284 --> 00:46:42.856
this verse a few lines down:
â€¦

00:46:42.856 --> 00:46:44.936
[the heavenly spirit that]
didst inspire That

00:46:44.936 --> 00:46:46.929
Shepherd, who first taught the
chosen Seed,

00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:49.758
 In the Beginning how the
Heav'ns and Earth Rose out

00:46:49.758 --> 00:46:51.405
of Chaos...
Now at first,

00:46:51.405 --> 00:46:54.006
I think Milton seems to mean
that the shepherd,

00:46:54.006 --> 00:46:57.679
Moses, inspired by the muse,
first taught the Israelites how

00:46:57.679 --> 00:47:01.269
the heavens and earth rose out
of chaos in the beginning.

00:47:01.269 --> 00:47:04.690
It was Moses who came up with
this phrase, Milton thought,

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:07.755
"in the beginning."
Those are the first words of

00:47:07.755 --> 00:47:11.013
the Book of Genesis;
but Milton has clearly placed

00:47:11.013 --> 00:47:14.163
this little phrase,
this adverbial phrase "in the

00:47:14.163 --> 00:47:18.275
Beginning," in an awkward place.
He frees himself -- this is an

00:47:18.275 --> 00:47:21.966
insight that William Kerrigan
has also had -- he frees himself

00:47:21.966 --> 00:47:24.750
from the strictures of
conventional syntax,

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:28.430
and he places that phrase "in
the Beginning" at the beginning

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.294
of the line, very strangely and
very awkwardly before the "how":

00:47:32.294 --> 00:47:35.300
"in the Beginning how the
Heav'ns and Earth."

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:39.886
He's done this because he wants
to permit this phrase to do more

00:47:39.886 --> 00:47:42.579
than simply modify the verb
"rose."

00:47:42.579 --> 00:47:46.138
We can also see in this phrase
"in the Beginning" -- we can see

00:47:46.138 --> 00:47:48.949
it applying to the end of the
preceding clause,

00:47:48.949 --> 00:47:52.444
"That Shepherd who first taught
the chosen Seed / in the

00:47:52.444 --> 00:47:55.186
Beginning."
"In the Beginning" can modify

00:47:55.186 --> 00:47:58.820
the verb "taught" as easily as
it can the verb "rose."

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:02.224
It can either verb assume,
just as Milton's angels can

00:48:02.224 --> 00:48:05.630
"either Sex assume."There's
an important point,

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.079
I think, that's being made with
this second possibility.

00:48:09.079 --> 00:48:13.574
Milton needs to imagine the
narrative of the Creation as if

00:48:13.574 --> 00:48:18.070
the narration itself were taking
place in the beginning,

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:22.108
as if poetic creation could be
a first in the same radical way

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:26.079
that the creation of entire
universe is obviously a first.

00:48:26.079 --> 00:48:29.364
This is a strategy called
double syntax,

00:48:29.364 --> 00:48:33.828
the notion that "in the
Beginning" can modify one verb

00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:36.568
or the other.
It's just this kind of

00:48:36.568 --> 00:48:39.778
rhetorical trick that Milton
uses -- so many rhetorical

00:48:39.778 --> 00:48:43.287
tricks like this that Milton
will use throughout the poem --

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.368
that led Dr.
Johnson to say in utter

00:48:45.368 --> 00:48:47.032
exasperation,
but admiration,

00:48:47.032 --> 00:48:50.005
that "Milton wrote no
language": this isn't English

00:48:50.005 --> 00:48:51.789
[laughs]
that Milton is writing

00:48:51.789 --> 00:48:55.059
here.Milton's language
doesn't have the same kind of

00:48:55.059 --> 00:48:58.151
headlong rush that most
declarative English sentences

00:48:58.151 --> 00:49:00.765
have.
We're continually being

00:49:00.765 --> 00:49:03.659
prevented from reading the text
to get to the end.

00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:06.604
We're prevented from rushing to
the end of the sentence,

00:49:06.604 --> 00:49:09.602
or to the end of the poem,
because at least as far as the

00:49:09.602 --> 00:49:12.865
-- well, you can understand why.
As far as the plot goes,

00:49:12.865 --> 00:49:15.674
we know how it's going to end.
We know, of course,

00:49:15.674 --> 00:49:18.699
that Adam and Eve are going to
eat the stupid fruit;

00:49:18.699 --> 00:49:21.752
but Milton is developing a
style -- and he's working really

00:49:21.752 --> 00:49:25.014
hard to do this -- that works to
resist our drive to get to the

00:49:25.014 --> 00:49:28.209
end of the story.
It's through a mechanism of an

00:49:28.209 --> 00:49:32.527
entirely new kind of verse that
Milton weaves into the metrical

00:49:32.527 --> 00:49:36.423
fabric of the poem,
a new perspective on that old

00:49:36.423 --> 00:49:40.334
theological problem of human
free will and divine

00:49:40.334 --> 00:49:43.710
foreknowledge.
Can it be said that we actually

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:47.692
chose to sin or to eat the apple
if God had known all along how

00:49:47.692 --> 00:49:50.496
the story would end,
or that we would do this thing

00:49:50.496 --> 00:49:53.515
in the first place?
That's the conundrum that on

00:49:53.515 --> 00:49:58.092
some level we've all confronted
and has been confronted since

00:49:58.092 --> 00:50:01.022
time began;
but Milton knows that if this

00:50:01.022 --> 00:50:04.491
poem is going to be successful,
we cannot as readers be

00:50:04.491 --> 00:50:07.960
permitted to think the story had
to be what it was.

00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:12.557
We can't be permitted to think
that the story had to turn out

00:50:12.557 --> 00:50:15.392
the way it did.
We need to think that the

00:50:15.392 --> 00:50:18.886
actions in the story were in
some way free and absolutely,

00:50:18.886 --> 00:50:22.330
perfectly undetermined.
We need to get at the story of

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:26.155
the Fall from the perspective of
its beginning rather than from

00:50:26.155 --> 00:50:29.486
the perspective of its
ending.And so Milton infuses

00:50:29.486 --> 00:50:32.997
this angelic freedom,
and he infuses this bodily

00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:36.740
liberty, into the actual body of
the verse itself,

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:41.891
of course, to make a point.
He's incorporating his style,

00:50:41.891 --> 00:50:47.185
a radical, original style,
into the essential argument of

00:50:47.185 --> 00:50:50.228
the poem.
He permits his own

00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:55.210
unconstrained indulgence in
poetic enjambment.

00:50:55.210 --> 00:50:58.349
He permits enjambment to become
the verbal medium.

00:50:58.349 --> 00:51:03.324
This is the pulsating vehicle
for his precious theology of

00:51:03.324 --> 00:51:07.950
free will and for his politics
of liberty.Okay.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:11.591
That's the end.
I want to remind you a final

00:51:11.591 --> 00:51:17.274
time to look at your Spenser,
the cave of Mammon episode,

00:51:17.274 --> 00:51:18.274
as well as Dr.

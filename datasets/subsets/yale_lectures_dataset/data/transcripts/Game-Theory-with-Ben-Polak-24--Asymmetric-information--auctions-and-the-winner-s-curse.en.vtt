00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:19.387
Professor Ben Polak:
Where have my jars of coins

00:13:19.387 --> 00:13:21.260
got to?
That isn't very far.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.341
They've only been on one row?
Well whiz them along this row

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:27.000
as fast as you can.
Just shake and pass now.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.384
Everybody who has had access to
those jars, can you please write

00:13:33.384 --> 00:13:37.539
down on your notebook--just
write down,

00:13:37.539 --> 00:13:41.288
but don't show it to your
neighbor--write down for each of

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:45.168
those two jars how many coins
you think are in the small jar

00:13:45.168 --> 00:13:48.720
and how many coins you think are
in the large jar.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.611
How many coins you think are in
the small jar and how many coins

00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:57.669
you think are in the large jar?
Keep passing it along.

00:13:57.669 --> 00:14:04.669
All right, so today I want to
talk about auctions.

00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:07.942
And just to put this in the
context of the whole class,

00:14:07.942 --> 00:14:10.730
way back on the very first day
of the class,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.279
we talked about different types
of people playing games.

00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:18.025
We talked about evil gits
versus indignant angels,

00:14:18.025 --> 00:14:19.929
and then for most of the
course,

00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:23.322
really until this week,
we've been assuming that you

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:25.649
knew who it was you were
playing.

00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:28.725
You knew your own payoffs but
you also knew whom it was you

00:14:28.725 --> 00:14:31.379
were playing against or with.
But the feature,

00:14:31.379 --> 00:14:35.100
the new feature of this week,
has been that we're looking at

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.443
settings where you don't
necessarily know what are the

00:14:38.443 --> 00:14:41.597
payoffs of the other people
involved in the game or

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:45.558
strategic situation.
So in the signaling model we

00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:49.510
looked at last time,
the different types of worker

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:54.269
had different types of payoffs
from going to get an MBA,

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:56.737
from going to business school,
and they yielded different

00:14:56.737 --> 00:14:58.279
payoffs to you if you hired
them.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:01.342
So we had to model the game
where you didn't quite know the

00:15:01.342 --> 00:15:03.929
payoffs of the people you were
playing against.

00:15:03.929 --> 00:15:06.827
Similarly, an auction--this is
what we're going to study

00:15:06.827 --> 00:15:08.250
today--is such a setting.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:16.138
Typically, in an auction,
you are competing or playing

00:15:16.138 --> 00:15:18.779
with or against the other
bidders.

00:15:18.779 --> 00:15:22.098
But typically you don't know
something crucial about those

00:15:22.098 --> 00:15:25.240
other bidders.
You don't know how much they

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.347
value the good in question.
So there's a good up for sale,

00:15:29.347 --> 00:15:32.509
and you don't know how much
they value that good.

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:35.037
So I want to start off by
thinking about a little bit of

00:15:35.037 --> 00:15:37.885
the informational structure of
auctions and then we'll get into

00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:41.361
more detail as we go along.
The first thing I wanted to

00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:47.770
distinguish are two extremes.
At one extreme I want to talk

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:56.316
about "common values" and at the
other extreme I want to talk

00:15:56.316 --> 00:16:02.955
about "private values."
So the idea of a common value

00:16:02.955 --> 00:16:09.434
auction is that the good that is
for sale ultimately has the same

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:13.864
value for whoever buys it.
Now that doesn't mean they're

00:16:13.864 --> 00:16:17.112
all going to be prepared to bid
the same amount because they may

00:16:17.112 --> 00:16:20.164
not know what that value is.
For example,

00:16:20.164 --> 00:16:24.025
imagine an oil well.
So there's an oil well out

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.938
there.
There's an oil reserve out

00:16:25.938 --> 00:16:29.594
there, and different companies
are trying to estimate how much

00:16:29.594 --> 00:16:33.010
they want to bid for the right
to draw oil out of this oil

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.250
field.
Each of them is going to make a

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.156
little practice well and get
some estimate of how much oil

00:16:38.156 --> 00:16:40.480
there is in the well,
so they're going to bid

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.830
different amounts.
But at the end of the day what

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.230
comes out of that well is the
same for everybody.

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:47.671
There is just one amount of oil
in that well,

00:16:47.671 --> 00:16:51.000
and that oil is just worth one
amount at the market price.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.149
So that's a classic example of
a common value auction.

00:16:56.149 --> 00:17:05.176
The value of the good for sale,
the true value if you like,

00:17:05.176 --> 00:17:11.256
is the same for all.
We'll use the notation V to

00:17:11.256 --> 00:17:15.880
denote this common value that
this object has.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.710
Now, the other extreme is
private value and it's really

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:21.539
such an extreme it's hard to
think of good examples.

00:17:21.539 --> 00:17:24.974
But the idea is that the value
of the good at hand,

00:17:24.974 --> 00:17:27.789
not only is it different for
everybody,

00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:32.185
but my valuation of this good
has no bearing whatsoever on

00:17:32.185 --> 00:17:36.956
your value for the good,
and your value for the good has

00:17:36.956 --> 00:17:41.240
no bearing whatsoever on my
value for the good.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.817
So here's a case where the
value of the good,

00:17:45.817 --> 00:17:50.500
the ultimate value of the good
in question,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:18:01.547
not only is it different for
all, but, moreover,

00:18:01.547 --> 00:18:15.179
it's completely idiosyncratic
and my value is irrelevant to

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:18.911
you.
So if you happen to buy this

00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:22.349
good and you learn that in fact,
I valued it a lot,

00:18:22.349 --> 00:18:27.063
that makes no difference to how
happy you feel at having bought

00:18:27.063 --> 00:18:30.121
the good.
Now, these are extremes and

00:18:30.121 --> 00:18:33.759
most of reality lies between.
I should give you the notation.

00:18:33.759 --> 00:18:38.822
Let's use V_i to be
the private values where i

00:18:38.822 --> 00:18:44.009
denotes the player in question.
These are extremes and most

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:47.841
things lie in between.
So we already mentioned that on

00:18:47.841 --> 00:18:50.101
this extreme,
close to this extreme,

00:18:50.101 --> 00:18:52.619
you could think about the oil
wells.

00:18:52.619 --> 00:18:56.720
Oil wells are pretty much
common value goods.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.360
There's a certain amount of oil
there and that's all there is to

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.329
it.
However, even there you could

00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:04.667
imagine that the different firms
have different costs on

00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:07.944
extracting that oil or these
different firms have their

00:19:07.944 --> 00:19:11.464
machinery occupied to different
extents in other wells that

00:19:11.464 --> 00:19:14.196
they're digging.
So even in that pure case,

00:19:14.196 --> 00:19:16.664
that seemingly perfect example
of a common value,

00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:19.029
it probably isn't literally a
common value.

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:22.919
Or these different firms have
different distances between the

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:26.087
wells and their refineries.
So the oil well is a good

00:19:26.087 --> 00:19:28.919
example of something that's
close to common value but it

00:19:28.919 --> 00:19:31.236
isn't really literally common
value, probably,

00:19:31.236 --> 00:19:34.290
in reality.
One's tempted to say that homes

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:37.313
are private value,
after all, my valuation,

00:19:37.313 --> 00:19:41.703
my happiness from living in my
house is not really affected by

00:19:41.703 --> 00:19:45.230
how happy you would feel living
in my house.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:47.092
I don't really care if you
would like to live in my house

00:19:47.092 --> 00:19:49.021
or if you wouldn't like to live
in my house because I'm the

00:19:49.021 --> 00:19:51.860
person living in it.
Is that right?

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:56.296
But there's a catch here.
What's the catch which makes

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.180
homes not literally private
value?

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:04.568
What's the catch?
The catch is that at some point

00:20:04.568 --> 00:20:07.620
in time I may want to resell my
home.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.686
The home is a durable good.
It's a consumption good,

00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.970
my living in it,
that's a private value.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:15.847
But it's also an investment
good, I'm going to want to

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:19.104
resell that home at some point
when I'm kicked out of Yale or

00:20:19.104 --> 00:20:21.294
whatever,
and then at that point at which

00:20:21.294 --> 00:20:24.215
I sell it, I'm going to care a
lot about how much you value it

00:20:24.215 --> 00:20:27.136
because that's going to affect
the price that I'm going to get

00:20:27.136 --> 00:20:30.555
at the end of the day.
So in the case of a home,

00:20:30.555 --> 00:20:34.805
it's somewhere between a
private value and a common

00:20:34.805 --> 00:20:37.920
value.
It's true that the consumption

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.306
part might be private value,
but the investment component

00:20:42.306 --> 00:20:46.369
introduces common values.
So really for private values,

00:20:46.369 --> 00:20:49.656
for pure private values,
we need to think about pure

00:20:49.656 --> 00:20:52.344
consumption goods.
Goods that I consume,

00:20:52.344 --> 00:20:56.029
they have no investment value,
they have no resale value.

00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:58.400
So think about some good being
sold on eBay.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.592
It's a cake, say.
So if I buy it,

00:21:01.592 --> 00:21:03.730
once I've eaten it,
I can't resell it.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.079
I can't have my cake and resell
it.

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:11.510
So think about pure consumption
goods over here.

00:21:15.869 --> 00:21:18.837
And even in these pure
consumption goods I mustn't get

00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:22.196
any psychological value out of
thinking I managed to get that

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:24.950
cake and you didn't.
So the private value case is

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.720
really an extreme thing,
but it turns out to be a useful

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.490
abstraction when we come to
consider things further.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:36.410
Now, where have my jars got to?
So I've got certainly two rows

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:39.700
I can play with here.
Let's talk about this auction

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.955
for the jars.
So what we're going to do is

00:21:41.955 --> 00:21:45.039
we're going to have people bid
for the value in the jar.

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.200
They're going to put forward a
bid.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:50.116
The highest bidder is going to
win, and what they're going to

00:21:50.116 --> 00:21:53.033
win is the amount of money in
the jar, but what they're going

00:21:53.033 --> 00:21:56.670
to pay is their bid.
So what is that?

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:01.270
Is that a common value or a
private value?

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.557
That's a common value.
There is a certain amount of

00:22:04.557 --> 00:22:06.623
money in that jar.
You don't know what it is,

00:22:06.623 --> 00:22:09.515
but there is a certain amount
of money in that jar and that's

00:22:09.515 --> 00:22:14.020
the common value.
So pretty much our jars of

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.785
coins lie over here.
They're probably even a purer

00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:23.672
example than the oil well.
All right, now let me get the

00:22:23.672 --> 00:22:29.791
first two rows of the class,
so this row here and this row

00:22:29.791 --> 00:22:31.983
here.
All of you have now had a

00:22:31.983 --> 00:22:33.849
chance to have a look at the
jars.

00:22:33.849 --> 00:22:37.200
Let me just get you to write
down, without looking at each

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.550
other, write down on your
notepads--you've already written

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.430
down how many coins you think
are in the jar.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:49.720
For the large jar--we'll do the
large jar first--write down your

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.694
bid.
Just so you can't cheat later

00:22:51.694 --> 00:22:54.349
on, write down your bid.
We're playing this for real

00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:57.180
cash, so if you win you're going
to have to pay me.

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.380
So write down what you're going
to bid.

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.724
Well I might not hold it to you
if it's too crazy,

00:23:02.724 --> 00:23:05.499
we'll see, but at least in
principle we're playing for real

00:23:05.499 --> 00:23:07.053
cash.
So write down your bid,

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.740
without changing your bid show
your neighbor your bid.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:16.459
Now, what I'm going to do
is--if I can just borrow Ale a

00:23:16.459 --> 00:23:22.221
second--here's some chalk.
Let me go along the row and

00:23:22.221 --> 00:23:27.099
find out what those bids were.
Ale you want to record the bids?

00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:29.374
So we're going to record
everybody's bid and we'll come

00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:30.890
back and talk about it
afterwards.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.954
Where are those jars by the way?
Let's have a look at

00:23:33.954 --> 00:23:37.610
the--Where's the jar gone?
Whose got the large jar there?

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:40.473
Yeah the woman in the corner.
Hold up that large jar so that

00:23:40.473 --> 00:23:43.069
everyone can see it.
That's the bid.

00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:48.089
It's coins in a Sainsbury's
pesto jar.

00:23:48.089 --> 00:23:49.970
Sainsbury's pesto turns out to
be quite good.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:53.250
All right, so I won't bother
with names today.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.470
I'm just going to get your bids.
Everyone's written down a bid.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:59.400
No one's going to cheat?
So what is your bid?

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.717
Student: $4.50.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:02.717 --> 00:24:04.000
$4.50.
Student: $3.00.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.082
Professor Ben Polak:
Shout it out so everyone can

00:24:05.082 --> 00:24:06.360
hear.
Student: $3.00.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.480
Student: $4.00.
Student: $.99.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.657
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, I'm going to pass this

00:24:12.657 --> 00:24:14.750
along so?
Student: $.80.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.000
Student: $3.80.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.110
Shout louder than that,
what was it?

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.817
Student: $3.80.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:19.817 --> 00:24:21.230
$3.80, go on.
Student: $4.00.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.490
Professor Ben Polak:
$4.00 again.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.914
Student: $2.09.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:24.914 --> 00:24:26.720
$2.09.
Student: $3.00.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:35.369
Student: $1.60.
Student: $2.01.

00:24:35.369 --> 00:24:37.460
Professor Ben Polak:
Sorry, the last one was what?

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:41.760
Student: $2.01.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.910
$2.01 here, that was after $1.60
though.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.820
Student: $.89.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.797
$.89.
Student: This is for the

00:24:49.797 --> 00:24:50.492
big jar?
Professor Ben Polak: The

00:24:50.492 --> 00:24:51.390
big jar.
Student: $1.40.

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.480
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.40, all right.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.990
Now we get a second row's worth
of people.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.687
Student: $1.41.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:56.687 --> 00:24:57.660
$1.41.
Student: $1.50.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.570
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.50.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:24:59.821
Student: $3.00.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:24:59.821 --> 00:25:00.569
$3.00.
Student: $2.00.

00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:01.350
Professor Ben Polak:
$2.00.

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:03.627
Student: $4.50.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:04.521
$4.50.
Student: $5.00

00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.346
Professor Ben Polak:
$5.00, we're getting some high

00:25:06.346 --> 00:25:07.519
ones now.
Student: $.01.

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.570
Professor Ben Polak:
$.01, okay.

00:25:09.570 --> 00:25:12.393
What's wrong with my jar?
Okay.

00:25:12.393 --> 00:25:19.799
All right, pass that along.
Student: $.80.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:20.880
Professor Ben Polak:
That was an $.80.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.837
Student: $1.50.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:25:22.837 --> 00:25:24.270
$1.50.
Student: $1.59.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.398
Student: $1.00.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:25:27.398 --> 00:25:28.309
$1.00.
Student: $1.20.

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:29.930
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.20 and three more.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.750
Student: $1.50.
Student: $1.50.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.975
Student: $2.00.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:25:34.975 --> 00:25:36.920
right, so we have lots of bids
and the winner is?

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.014
The last one was $2.00.
I've actually forgotten how

00:25:40.014 --> 00:25:45.830
many coins were in here.
Let me just remind myself.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:49.569
This was the large jar right?
Okay now I know again.

00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:54.019
All right, so who is our winner
there?

00:25:54.019 --> 00:25:57.880
We've got a $4.50 here,
there's a $5.00.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.069
Okay so here's our winner,
who's our winner?

00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:08.269
Let's have our winner stand up
a second.

00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:14.359
So now a round of applause for
our winner.

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:18.307
Now, let's talk about how
people bid, and why they bid

00:26:18.307 --> 00:26:24.515
that amount.
Okay, so let's start with our

00:26:24.515 --> 00:26:27.490
winner.
So why did you bid $5.00?

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:30.911
Student: It looked like
there could about $5.00 in

00:26:30.911 --> 00:26:32.157
there.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:26:32.157 --> 00:26:33.380
right, so I've forgotten your
name, your name is?

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.761
Student: Ashley.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:38.083
Ashley is saying she bid roughly
$5.00 because it looked like

00:26:38.083 --> 00:26:40.194
there was about $5.00 in there.
Student: Plus you get

00:26:40.194 --> 00:26:41.635
the jar.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:26:41.635 --> 00:26:43.787
Plus you get the jar,
I'm not sure I'm throwing in

00:26:43.787 --> 00:26:46.314
the jar.
Let's just sample a few other

00:26:46.314 --> 00:26:49.430
people and see what they say.
What did you say again?

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.158
Student: I said $1.60
because I didn't want to over

00:26:53.158 --> 00:26:56.886
estimate it because then I'd
have to pay you more than I'd

00:26:56.886 --> 00:26:58.387
get.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:26:58.387 --> 00:26:59.460
right, so what was your
estimate?

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:03.438
Student: My estimate was
about $1.80 to $2.00 so I bid

00:27:03.438 --> 00:27:05.311
under that.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:07.300
your estimate was $1.80 to $2.00
and you bid around $1.60.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.220
Person next to you?
Student: Well I guess

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:13.753
$3.00 and same reasoning.
I thought there would probably

00:27:13.753 --> 00:27:17.329
be about $4.00 and then I valued
it at like $1.00.

00:27:17.329 --> 00:27:19.480
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so you thought there was

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.180
about $4.00 worth of coin and
you actually bid?

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.305
Student: $3.00.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:27:23.305 --> 00:27:25.107
$3.00 all right,
so all of you actually wrote

00:27:25.107 --> 00:27:27.359
down initially how many coins
you thought were in there,

00:27:27.359 --> 00:27:28.660
right?
Is that right?

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.299
Let's just get some idea of the
distribution of those.

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:35.672
So how many people thought
there was less than $1.00 in

00:27:35.672 --> 00:27:37.291
there?
Raise your hand:

00:27:37.291 --> 00:27:39.599
no shame here,
just raise your hands.

00:27:39.599 --> 00:27:43.930
How many people thought there
was between $1.00 and $1.50?

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.920
How many people thought there
was between $1.50 and $2.00?

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:53.180
How many people thought there
was between $2.00 and $2.50?

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.580
How many people thought there
was between $2.50 and $3.00?

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:04.262
How about more than $3.50?
Clearly the people who bid high

00:28:04.262 --> 00:28:06.319
did.
So we have a whole range of

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:08.839
estimates there,
a wide range of estimates,

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:12.041
a wide range of bids.
And people are saying things

00:28:12.041 --> 00:28:15.690
like: well, I thought there was
this many coins in there.

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.402
Maybe I shaded down a little
bit from the number of coins I

00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:21.067
thought was in there because I
want to make some profit on

00:28:21.067 --> 00:28:24.027
this, is that right?
That's kind of the explanations

00:28:24.027 --> 00:28:28.513
I'm hearing from people.
What I want to suggest is

00:28:28.513 --> 00:28:34.640
that's not a very good way to
bid in this auction.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.232
So let's just repeat what I
think people did,

00:28:36.232 --> 00:28:37.970
and people can contradict me if
this is wrong.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.240
I think most people,
they shook this thing.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.550
They weighed it a bit.
They figured out there was,

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.240
let's say, $3.50 worth of
pennies in there.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.120
And then they said,
okay $3.50, so I'll bid $3.40,

00:28:52.120 --> 00:29:00.140
$3.30 something like that.
So what's wrong with that?

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.890
Well first of all,
to reveal that there's

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.252
something wrong with it,
let me tell you how many coins

00:29:04.252 --> 00:29:11.408
were in there.
In the larger jar there was

00:29:11.408 --> 00:29:15.444
$2.07.
How many of you bid more than

00:29:15.444 --> 00:29:20.020
$2.07?
Just raise your hands.

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:24.358
Quite a few of you, all right.
So what we see here is a number

00:29:24.358 --> 00:29:29.574
of people, including our winner,
bid a lot more than the number

00:29:29.574 --> 00:29:33.678
of coins in the jar.
What we find,

00:29:33.678 --> 00:29:40.684
by a lot, is that the winning
bid was much,

00:29:40.684 --> 00:29:46.690
much greater than the true
value.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:51.480
This is a common phenomenon in
common value auctions.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.950
It's such a common phenomenon
that it has a name.

00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:01.900
The name is the "winner's
curse."

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:08.371
It's the winner's curse.
And the main lesson of the

00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:12.245
first half of today is going to
be: let's figure out why there

00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:15.769
exists a winner's curse;
let's try and avoid falling

00:30:15.769 --> 00:30:19.714
into a winner's curse;
and maybe let's even figure out

00:30:19.714 --> 00:30:23.400
how to do better.
So let's try and think through

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.530
why it is we fall into a
winner's curse.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:38.376
So one way to think about this
is to think about naïve

00:30:38.376 --> 00:30:44.180
bidding in this context.
So suppose people's strategy

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.630
was actually to bid their
estimate.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.529
I know that isn't what people
did.

00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:51.109
Most people shaded their
estimate a little bit.

00:30:51.109 --> 00:30:53.640
But most people bid pretty
close to their estimate.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.930
What's going to happen in that
instance is what?

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.730
People are going to bid
essentially what they think it's

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.737
worth, and we just saw that
fully half of you--I should say

00:31:05.737 --> 00:31:08.778
half the people we
sampled--overestimated the

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:11.859
number of coins in there.
Is that right?

00:31:11.859 --> 00:31:12.670
Let's just have that show of
hands.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.786
How many people,
raise your hands again,

00:31:14.786 --> 00:31:17.227
let's be honest,
if you thought there was more

00:31:17.227 --> 00:31:19.833
than $2.07 in there.
So maybe roughly a half,

00:31:19.833 --> 00:31:23.199
maybe a little less than a half
of you overestimated the number

00:31:23.199 --> 00:31:26.130
of coins in there.
Now, what's that going to mean?

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.148
It's going to mean all of those
people who have this

00:31:29.148 --> 00:31:31.279
overestimate are going to
overbid.

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:35.150
But we can be a little bit more
general and a little bit more

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.422
rigorous about this.
So let's try and be a little

00:31:37.422 --> 00:31:39.016
bit more general.
So first of all,

00:31:39.016 --> 00:31:42.547
let's just make sure we
understand what the payoffs are

00:31:42.547 --> 00:31:53.103
in this auction.
The payoff in this auction is

00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:57.711
what?
You get the true value,

00:31:57.711 --> 00:32:03.774
you get the number of
coins--the number of pennies in

00:32:03.774 --> 00:32:09.720
the jar--minus your bid,
if you are the highest;

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:15.974
and you get 0 otherwise.
I think it's straightforward,

00:32:15.974 --> 00:32:18.030
we all understand that's what
the value is.

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.710
And what do people do?
People tried to estimate--this

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:25.695
is not a mistake--people tried
to estimate how many coins were

00:32:25.695 --> 00:32:27.615
in the jar.
Now, in fact,

00:32:27.615 --> 00:32:32.254
the true number of coins in the
jar was V which turned out be

00:32:32.254 --> 00:32:34.789
$2.07.
But when people estimate it,

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:38.534
they don't get it exactly
right, neither here where you're

00:32:38.534 --> 00:32:41.425
shaking the jar,
nor in the case of these oil

00:32:41.425 --> 00:32:44.174
samples.
So what they actually

00:32:44.174 --> 00:32:49.498
estimate--each person forms an
estimate, which we could call

00:32:49.498 --> 00:32:54.371
Y_i--and this
Y_i we could think of

00:32:54.371 --> 00:32:58.374
as being the truth plus noise.
So let's call it

00:32:58.374 --> 00:33:00.618
Îµ_i.
Let's even put a tilde on it to

00:33:00.618 --> 00:33:02.190
make it clearer that it's a
random term.

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:05.980
So for some people
Îµ_i is going to

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.849
be a positive amount,
which means they're going to

00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:13.640
overestimate the number of coins
in the jar.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.043
And for some people
Îµ_i is going to

00:33:16.043 --> 00:33:18.446
be a negative amount,
which means they're going to

00:33:18.446 --> 00:33:20.850
underestimate the number of
coins in the jar.

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:24.123
Everyone agree with that?
That's not a controversial

00:33:24.123 --> 00:33:26.759
statement, everyone okay with
that?

00:33:26.759 --> 00:33:30.217
So let's think about the
distribution of these

00:33:30.217 --> 00:33:34.231
Y_i's.
Let's draw a picture that has

00:33:34.231 --> 00:33:39.765
on the horizontal axis all the
different estimates that people

00:33:39.765 --> 00:33:44.119
could form of the number of
coins in the jar.

00:33:44.119 --> 00:33:48.660
And let's anchor this by V,
so here's V.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.647
And here is going to be,
if you like,

00:33:51.647 --> 00:33:56.626
the probability of getting that
estimate: so the frequency or

00:33:56.626 --> 00:34:00.693
probability of estimating
Y_i given that

00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:04.615
V_i is there.
So I don't know what the shape

00:34:04.615 --> 00:34:07.444
of this distribution is but my
guess is it's kind of bell

00:34:07.444 --> 00:34:08.849
shaped.
Is that right?

00:34:08.849 --> 00:34:15.080
So it probably looks something
like this.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.497
That seem plausible?
We could actually test this if

00:34:18.497 --> 00:34:20.558
we had time.
We could actually go around all

00:34:20.558 --> 00:34:22.809
of you and get you to report
what your estimates were,

00:34:22.809 --> 00:34:24.944
and we could plot that
distribution and see if it is

00:34:24.944 --> 00:34:26.484
bell shaped.
But my guess is,

00:34:26.484 --> 00:34:29.050
it's reasonable to assume its
bell shaped.

00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.883
There's some central tendency
to estimate something close to

00:34:31.883 --> 00:34:34.149
the truth.
If I'd drawn this correctly I'd

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:36.868
have its highest point at V.
I haven't quite drawn it

00:34:36.868 --> 00:34:39.820
correctly.
It's probably roughly symmetric.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:44.374
Okay, so now suppose that
people's bidding strategy is

00:34:44.374 --> 00:34:49.269
pretty much what they reported.
People are going to bid roughly

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:52.590
their estimate of the number of
coins in the jar.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:35:02.675
So suppose people bid
B_i roughly equal to

00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:06.815
Y_i.
So I know people are going to

00:35:06.815 --> 00:35:08.530
shade a little bit,
but let's ignore that for now.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:14.430
So people are bidding roughly
equal to Y_i.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:20.070
So what's going to happen here?
Who's going to win?

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:24.192
If this is the way in which the
Y_i's emerge naturally

00:35:24.192 --> 00:35:28.053
in life--there's a true V and
then people make some estimate

00:35:28.053 --> 00:35:31.848
of it which is essentially V
plus noise--who's going to end

00:35:31.848 --> 00:35:35.489
up being the winner,
the winner of the auction?

00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:39.199
It's going to be the person who
has the highest estimate.

00:35:39.199 --> 00:35:42.479
So if there's really a lot of
people the winner isn't going to

00:35:42.479 --> 00:35:45.059
be the person who estimated it
correctly at V.

00:35:45.059 --> 00:35:48.150
The winner's going to be way
out here somewhere.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:54.910
The winner is going to be way
up in the right hand tail.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:36:04.744
Why?
Because the winner will then be

00:36:04.744 --> 00:36:19.690
the i who's Y_i is the
biggest, the maximum.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:23.509
The problem with this is the
person whose Y_i is

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:28.257
the biggest has what?
They have the biggest error:

00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:33.640
the person whose Y_i
is the max, i.e.,

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:38.437
Îµ_i is the max.
And that's exactly what

00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:41.014
happened.
When we did estimates just now

00:36:41.014 --> 00:36:43.932
the person who won was the
person, Ashley,

00:36:43.932 --> 00:36:48.272
who had estimated there to be
roughly (maybe a little bit more

00:36:48.272 --> 00:36:51.190
than) $5.00 worth of coins in
there.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.929
So I'm guessing,
is this right,

00:36:52.929 --> 00:36:56.409
that no one else estimated more
than $5.00 in these two rows,

00:36:56.409 --> 00:36:58.546
is that correct?
No one estimated more than

00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:00.117
$5.00.
So the person who had the

00:37:00.117 --> 00:37:03.151
highest estimate bid the most,
which is pretty close to her

00:37:03.151 --> 00:37:05.610
estimate, and that caused her to
lose money.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.423
She ends up owing me whatever
it is, $1.93,

00:37:09.423 --> 00:37:12.510
which I will collect
afterwards.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.480
So the winner's curse is caused
by this.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.249
It's caused by:
if people bid taking into

00:37:19.249 --> 00:37:23.472
account their own estimate and
only their own estimates of the

00:37:23.472 --> 00:37:27.418
number of coins in the jar or
the amount of oil in the oil

00:37:27.418 --> 00:37:29.874
well,
then the winner ends up being

00:37:29.874 --> 00:37:33.321
the person with the highest
estimate, which means the person

00:37:33.321 --> 00:37:38.179
with the highest error.
So notice what this leads to.

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:49.039
On average, the winning bid is
going to be much,

00:37:49.039 --> 00:37:58.070
much bigger than the truth.
Is that right?

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.336
The biggest error is typically
going to be way out in this

00:38:01.336 --> 00:38:04.716
right tail and that's going to
mean people are going to lose

00:38:04.716 --> 00:38:07.195
money.
All right, so this phenomenon

00:38:07.195 --> 00:38:11.400
is very general because common
value auctions are very general.

00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.429
I already mentioned the oil
fields.

00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:16.744
In the early period after World
War II when the U.S.

00:38:16.744 --> 00:38:20.579
Government started auctioning
out the rights to drill oil in

00:38:20.579 --> 00:38:24.717
the gulf, in the Gulf of Mexico,
early on, it was observed that

00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:26.994
these companies,
the winning companies,

00:38:26.994 --> 00:38:30.590
the companies who won the bid
each time was losing money.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.706
It was great for the
government, but these companies

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:34.905
were consistently losing money,
they were consistently

00:38:34.905 --> 00:38:37.322
overbidding.
Be careful, it wasn't that the

00:38:37.322 --> 00:38:39.599
companies as a whole were
overbidding.

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:42.301
It was that the winning bid was
over bidding:

00:38:42.301 --> 00:38:45.553
it was the winner's curse.
Over time, companies figured

00:38:45.553 --> 00:38:49.057
this out and they've figured out
that they shouldn't bid as much,

00:38:49.057 --> 00:38:52.481
and this in fact went away.
But you also see this effect in

00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:55.469
other places where naïve
bidders are involved.

00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:57.988
So for example,
those people who have been

00:38:57.988 --> 00:39:00.630
following the baseball free
agent market,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:03.409
I think you could argue
that--someone can do an

00:39:03.409 --> 00:39:06.733
empirical test of this--you
could argue that the winning

00:39:06.733 --> 00:39:10.117
bids on free agents in the
baseball free agent market end

00:39:10.117 --> 00:39:13.320
up being horrible overbids for
the same reason.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.677
The team who has the highest
idiosyncratic estimate of the

00:39:16.677 --> 00:39:19.269
person's value ends up hiring
that player,

00:39:19.269 --> 00:39:24.719
but the highest idiosyncratic
value tends to be too high.

00:39:24.719 --> 00:39:28.175
Similarly, perhaps more
importantly, if you look at

00:39:28.175 --> 00:39:31.217
IPO's, initial public offerings
of companies,

00:39:31.217 --> 00:39:35.472
they tend to sell too high.
The baseball one I haven't got

00:39:35.472 --> 00:39:39.556
the data, but the IPO's we know
that there's a tendency for

00:39:39.556 --> 00:39:41.796
IPO's,
initial public offerings of

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:45.424
companies, to have too high a
share price and for those shares

00:39:45.424 --> 00:39:48.334
to fall back after awhile.
There may be a little bit of

00:39:48.334 --> 00:39:50.153
initial enthusiasm,
but then they fall back.

00:39:50.153 --> 00:39:51.812
Why?
Again, the people with the

00:39:51.812 --> 00:39:54.904
highest estimates of the value
of the company end up winning

00:39:54.904 --> 00:39:57.572
the company,
and if they're not

00:39:57.572 --> 00:40:03.429
sophisticated about the way they
bid then they overbid.

00:40:03.429 --> 00:40:07.566
So this is a serious problem
out there and it raises the

00:40:07.566 --> 00:40:10.650
issue: well, how should I
correct this?

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:13.258
I might, in life,
be involved in an auction as a

00:40:13.258 --> 00:40:16.309
bidder for something that has a
common value element.

00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:19.260
How should I think about how I
should bid?

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:20.300
We've learned how we shouldn't
bid.

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:23.160
We shouldn't just bid my
estimate minus a little.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:29.097
So how should we think about it?
Now, to walk us towards that

00:40:29.097 --> 00:40:32.858
let me try and think about a
little bit more about the

00:40:32.858 --> 00:40:37.480
information that's out there.
Let's go back to our oil well

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:40.425
example.
Each of these oil companies

00:40:40.425 --> 00:40:45.267
drills a test well in the oil
field, and from this test well

00:40:45.267 --> 00:40:49.369
each of them gets an estimate of
Y_i.

00:40:49.369 --> 00:40:52.471
So you can imagine someone
doing a test drill into my jar

00:40:52.471 --> 00:40:55.682
of coins, and when they do this
test drill into this jar of

00:40:55.682 --> 00:40:58.230
coins they form an estimate
Y_i.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:02.747
And suppose that your estimate
of the number of coins in the

00:41:02.747 --> 00:41:06.039
jar or the amount of oil in the
oil well,

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:13.190
suppose that your particular
one is equal to 150.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:16.509
Then, if I then asked you the
question--not to bid--but I

00:41:16.509 --> 00:41:20.065
asked you the question how many
coins do you think are in the

00:41:20.065 --> 00:41:22.650
jar.
Your answer would be 150.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.739
That would be your best
estimate.

00:41:24.739 --> 00:41:28.343
But suppose I then told you
that your neighbor,

00:41:28.343 --> 00:41:32.014
let's go back to Ashley again.
So Ashley's estimate was,

00:41:32.014 --> 00:41:34.483
let's say, it was 150--it
wasn't, but let's say it was

00:41:34.483 --> 00:41:36.387
150.
And suppose I went to her

00:41:36.387 --> 00:41:40.000
neighbor and asked her neighbor.
And her neighbor said:

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.130
actually, I think there's only
130 in there.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.821
So suppose Ashley now knows
that she did a little test,

00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:51.698
she thinks there's 150.
But she now knows that her

00:41:51.698 --> 00:41:59.619
neighbor has done a similar test
and he thinks there's only 130.

00:41:59.619 --> 00:42:02.658
Now what should be Ashley's
estimate of the number of coins

00:42:02.658 --> 00:42:05.260
in the jar?
Somewhere in between;

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:09.241
so probably somewhere between
150 and 130, maybe about 140,

00:42:09.241 --> 00:42:13.380
but certainly lower than 150.
Is that right?

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.622
So if I told you that someone
else had an estimate that was 20

00:42:17.622 --> 00:42:21.587
lower than yours that would
cause you to lower your belief

00:42:21.587 --> 00:42:24.369
about how many coins was in the
jar.

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:27.280
Now let's push this a little
harder.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:32.805
Suppose I told you not that
your neighbor had an estimate of

00:42:32.805 --> 00:42:38.612
130, but just that your neighbor
had an estimate that was lower

00:42:38.612 --> 00:42:41.574
than 150.
I'm not going to tell you

00:42:41.574 --> 00:42:45.341
exactly what your neighbor
estimates, I'm just going to

00:42:45.341 --> 00:42:48.829
tell you that his estimate is
lower than yours.

00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:53.517
So your initial belief was
there was 150 coins in this jar,

00:42:53.517 --> 00:42:58.690
but now I know that my neighbor
thinks there's fewer than 150.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:05.040
Do you think your belief is
still 150 or is it lower?

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.250
Who thinks it's gone up?
It hasn't gone up.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.690
Who thinks it's gone down?
It's gone down.

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:13.978
I don't know exactly by how
much to pull it down,

00:43:13.978 --> 00:43:18.158
but the fact that I know that
my neighbor has a lower estimate

00:43:18.158 --> 00:43:22.679
than me suggests that I should
have a lower estimate than 150.

00:43:22.679 --> 00:43:25.309
Now I'm going to tell you
something more dramatic.

00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:28.576
Suppose I go to Ashley and say
your initial estimate

00:43:28.576 --> 00:43:32.420
was--actually it wasn't 150,
it was $5.00--so let's do it.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.539
So your initial estimate was
500 pennies.

00:43:36.539 --> 00:43:40.373
And I'm not going to tell you
what your neighbor's estimate

00:43:40.373 --> 00:43:41.868
was.
I'm not going to tell you what

00:43:41.868 --> 00:43:43.369
your neighbor's,
neighbors estimate was.

00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:48.383
But I'm going to tell you that
every single person in the row,

00:43:48.383 --> 00:43:53.068
in the two rows other than you,
had an estimate lower than

00:43:53.068 --> 00:43:55.945
$5.00.
So Ashley's estimate was $5.00,

00:43:55.945 --> 00:43:59.923
but I'm now going to tell her
that every single person in the

00:43:59.923 --> 00:44:02.510
room had a lower estimate than
hers.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:10.815
So what I'm going to tell her
is that Y_j &lt;

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:19.422
Y_i for all_
j,_ for all the

00:44:19.422 --> 00:44:23.849
other people.
But I claim that if you tell me

00:44:23.849 --> 00:44:26.670
that everybody else--there were
probably what,

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.441
30 other people there--has an
estimate lower than

00:44:30.441 --> 00:44:34.369
mine--everyone else--what should
I now estimate?

00:44:34.369 --> 00:44:36.889
What should happen to my
estimate?

00:44:36.889 --> 00:44:40.619
It's going to come down a lot,
is that right?

00:44:40.619 --> 00:44:43.111
If my estimate was $5.00 but I
know everybody else,

00:44:43.111 --> 00:44:45.602
not just one person,
but everybody else had a lower

00:44:45.602 --> 00:44:48.110
estimate,
then my guess of the number of

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:50.840
coins in the jar has come down a
whole lot.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:56.339
But what?
But that's exactly what Ashley

00:44:56.339 --> 00:45:02.119
knows as soon as she found out
that she's won the auction.

00:45:02.119 --> 00:45:05.222
If people are bidding their
values--sorry not their

00:45:05.222 --> 00:45:08.199
values--if people are bidding
their estimates,

00:45:08.199 --> 00:45:12.016
then as soon as Ashley
discovers she's won,

00:45:12.016 --> 00:45:16.377
she's going to say:
oh bother, I now know that my

00:45:16.377 --> 00:45:19.765
estimate was too high.
She may say something more

00:45:19.765 --> 00:45:21.579
extravagant than bother,
but at the very least,

00:45:21.579 --> 00:45:22.920
she is going to say:
oh bother,

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.012
I now know that everyone else
had a lower estimate than me,

00:45:27.012 --> 00:45:30.469
and therefore my estimate of
$5.00 is too high.

00:45:30.469 --> 00:45:32.955
So what's going to happen is if
people start bidding their

00:45:32.955 --> 00:45:34.699
estimates or close to their
estimates,

00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:38.868
then once they've won,
they're going to learn exactly

00:45:38.868 --> 00:45:40.886
this.
They're going to learn that

00:45:40.886 --> 00:45:43.960
everyone else's estimate was
lower than theirs and they're

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.680
going to regret their choices.
It can't be a good idea--it

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.706
can't be an equilibrium--for
people to make choices which

00:45:51.706 --> 00:45:54.510
they're going to regret if they
win.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:59.639
That's crazy.
So we need to think about how

00:45:59.639 --> 00:46:03.280
to correct for that.
So how do we correct for it?

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.650
Now let's talk about this a
little bit harder.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:09.646
Each of you,
in your bidding for this jar of

00:46:09.646 --> 00:46:15.223
coins, I claim you only really
care about how many coins were

00:46:15.223 --> 00:46:20.998
in the jar, in one circumstance.
What's the only circumstance in

00:46:20.998 --> 00:46:25.150
which you care at all how many
coins are in the jar?

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:34.730
If you win.
I claim you only care how many

00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:44.281
coins are in the jar,
or how much oil is in the well,

00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:52.730
if you win, if your bid is the
winning bid.

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:57.199
If your bid is the winning bid
what do you know?

00:46:57.199 --> 00:47:01.431
You know that your estimate was
the highest estimate in the room

00:47:01.431 --> 00:47:05.394
(at least if this equilibrium
has the property that bids are

00:47:05.394 --> 00:47:09.760
increasing in estimates per se,
which is not much to expect).

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:18.230
So you know in this case,
you would have an estimate

00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:28.528
Y_i that was at least
as big as Y_j for all

00:47:28.528 --> 00:47:34.010
the other people in the room.

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:39.752
So where are we?
You only care how many coins

00:47:39.752 --> 00:47:42.417
are in the jar if you win,
and if you win you know your

00:47:42.417 --> 00:47:46.619
estimate was the highest.
So what's the relevant estimate?

00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:49.568
The relevant estimate of the
number of coins in the jar for

00:47:49.568 --> 00:47:52.581
you when you're bidding,
the relevant estimate is not

00:47:52.581 --> 00:47:56.326
how many coins do I think is in
this jar, that's the naïve

00:47:56.326 --> 00:47:58.864
thing.
The relevant estimate is:

00:47:58.864 --> 00:48:03.811
how many coins do I think is in
this jar given my shaking of it

00:48:03.811 --> 00:48:08.360
and given the fact that I
have won the auction,

00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.510
given the supposition that I
might win the auction.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:32.921
So the relevant estimate when
bidding is how many coins do I

00:48:32.921 --> 00:48:47.800
think are there given my initial
guess,

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:56.547
Y_i,
and given that Y_i is

00:48:56.547 --> 00:49:03.495
bigger than Y_j.
Now, notice this is kind of a

00:49:03.495 --> 00:49:05.269
weird thing.
It's a counter factual thing.

00:49:05.269 --> 00:49:07.278
I don't know at the time at
which I'm bidding,

00:49:07.278 --> 00:49:08.929
I don't know that I'm going to
win.

00:49:08.929 --> 00:49:12.128
But nevertheless,
I should bid as if I knew I was

00:49:12.128 --> 00:49:14.727
going to win,
because I only care in the

00:49:14.727 --> 00:49:18.484
circumstance in which I win.
So the way in which I should

00:49:18.484 --> 00:49:21.559
estimate the number of coins in
the jar, and indeed,

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:25.910
the way in which I should bid
is, I should bid the number of

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:30.040
coins I would think were in the
jar if I won [correction:

00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:32.320
less a few].
Say that again,

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.960
I should bid [correction:
fewer than]

00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:39.213
the number of coins I would
think were in the jar if my bid

00:49:39.213 --> 00:49:50.404
ends up being the winning bid.
So the lesson here is,

00:49:50.404 --> 00:50:02.769
bid as if you know you win.
Now why is that a good idea?

00:50:02.769 --> 00:50:05.840
Let's go back to this case of
now you discover you've won.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.829
Provided you bid as if you know
you won, when you win you're not

00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:11.344
going to be disappointed because
you already took that

00:50:11.344 --> 00:50:14.794
information into account.
But if you bid not as if you

00:50:14.794 --> 00:50:18.795
won, you failed to take into
account the possibility of

00:50:18.795 --> 00:50:21.620
winning,
then winning's going to come as

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.655
a shock to you and cause regret.
So the only way to prevent this

00:50:25.655 --> 00:50:28.405
ex-post regret,
the only way to bid optimally,

00:50:28.405 --> 00:50:31.340
is to bid as if you know you're
going to win.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.544
Estimate the number of coins
not on your own sample but on

00:50:35.544 --> 00:50:39.380
the belief that your sample is
the biggest sample.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:45.457
Question?
Student: I don't

00:50:45.457 --> 00:50:47.453
understand what the difference
is between bidding,

00:50:47.453 --> 00:50:49.573
sorry,
I don't understand what the

00:50:49.573 --> 00:50:53.665
difference is between bidding as
if you know you win and what if

00:50:53.665 --> 00:50:55.817
you won right?
Because if you bid,

00:50:55.817 --> 00:50:58.683
like whenever you bid,
you're bidding the number that

00:50:58.683 --> 00:51:01.315
you think,
oh well, I think there are this

00:51:01.315 --> 00:51:04.589
many coins in the jar,
so if I win I don't want to bid

00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:07.059
too many so that I don't lose,
right?

00:51:07.059 --> 00:51:07.429
Professor Ben Polak:
Good.

00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:09.263
Student: So how is that
different from bidding as if you

00:51:09.263 --> 00:51:12.258
know you win versus if you won?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:51:12.258 --> 00:51:16.101
Good question.
So how is it different to say

00:51:16.101 --> 00:51:19.780
bidding as if I know I win?
Let me try and say it again.

00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:22.085
So what you're going to do is
you're going to think of the

00:51:22.085 --> 00:51:25.766
following thought experiment.
Suppose you told me I won,

00:51:25.766 --> 00:51:30.060
now how many coins do I think
are in the jar?

00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:33.721
Let me bid that amount.
So before we even do the bid,

00:51:33.721 --> 00:51:35.769
let's do the following thought
experiment.

00:51:35.769 --> 00:51:37.760
You're figuring out how many
coins you think are there.

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.362
Now I say, suppose it turns out
that your estimate's the highest

00:51:41.362 --> 00:51:44.449
estimate, now how many coins do
you think are there?

00:51:44.449 --> 00:51:46.550
That's what you should bid
[correction: minus a little].

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:50.800
I'm arguing that being told
that your estimate's the highest

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.329
is going to drag down that
estimate a long way.

00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:58.382
But the key idea is if you bid
as if you know you win then you

00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:02.170
won't regret winning and that's
what you want to avoid.

00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:06.309
You want to avoid the winner's
curse.

00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:09.491
Now let's see how that goes on,
let me swap places with Ale

00:52:09.491 --> 00:52:12.155
again.
And let's see if we can

00:52:12.155 --> 00:52:17.670
actually very quickly just do
one row on the second jar.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.717
So this is the yellow mic.
So same group of people,

00:52:21.717 --> 00:52:26.931
let me get people to shout
these out fairly quickly so that

00:52:26.931 --> 00:52:30.274
we move on.
So these two rows,

00:52:30.274 --> 00:52:35.369
write down your bid on the
smaller jar now.

00:52:35.369 --> 00:52:37.969
This is your bid,
not your estimate.

00:52:37.969 --> 00:52:41.429
Write down your bid on the
smaller jar.

00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:45.030
As fast as we can go,
just shout out a number.

00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:46.583
Student: $.40.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:47.439
$.40.
Student: $1.00.

00:52:47.439 --> 00:52:48.440
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.00.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.841
Student: $1.20.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:52:49.841 --> 00:52:50.938
$1.20.
Student: $1.50.

00:52:50.938 --> 00:52:52.320
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.50.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.908
Student: $.98.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:54.761
$.98.
Student: $1.00.

00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:55.750
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.00.

00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.198
Student: $.90.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:52:57.198 --> 00:52:58.013
$.90.
Student: $.75.

00:52:58.013 --> 00:52:58.989
Professor Ben Polak:
$.75.

00:52:58.989 --> 00:53:00.709
Student: $1.60.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:00.709 --> 00:53:01.541
$1.60.
Student: $1.50.

00:53:01.541 --> 00:53:02.420
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.50.

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:05.170
Student: $1.40.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:07.884
$1.40, okay I'm going to pass
this in, so I'll go to the other

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:09.860
side.
Keep shouting them out.

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:12.949
Student: $.95.
Student: $.80.

00:53:12.949 --> 00:53:13.989
Professor Ben Polak:
$.80.

00:53:13.989 --> 00:53:15.648
Student: $.50.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:15.648 --> 00:53:17.530
$.50.
Student: $.75.

00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.468
Student: $1.25.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:19.468 --> 00:53:20.440
$1.25.
Student: $1.50.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.826
Student: $1.30.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:22.826 --> 00:53:23.849
$1.30.
Student: $1.25.

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:24.710
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.25.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:25.993
Student: $1.09.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:25.993 --> 00:53:27.210
$1.09.
Student: $1.15.

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:28.020
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.15 and?

00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.829
Student: $.80.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:33.159
$.80, did I get everybody?
$.80 was the last one.

00:53:33.159 --> 00:53:35.942
So okay the bids came down
partly because the jar was

00:53:35.942 --> 00:53:38.030
smaller of course,
which is cheating.

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.065
But let me just tell you--let's
find out who the winner was

00:53:41.065 --> 00:53:46.123
first of all.
So $1.60 is the winner and it

00:53:46.123 --> 00:53:54.670
turns out that the number of
coins in this jar was $1.48.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:57.929
So what happened here?
I think people took into

00:53:57.929 --> 00:54:00.659
account--people did lower their
bids below the estimates.

00:54:00.659 --> 00:54:03.769
Let's just check actually,
so who was my $1.60 person?

00:54:03.769 --> 00:54:09.579
Stand up my $1.60 person,
so how many coins did you think

00:54:09.579 --> 00:54:13.579
were in there?
Student: $1.60.

00:54:13.579 --> 00:54:15.770
Professor Ben Polak:
$1.60, your name is?

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.308
Student: Robert.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:54:18.308 --> 00:54:20.466
Robert thought there was,
hang on, you bid $1.60,

00:54:20.466 --> 00:54:22.490
how many coins did you think
was in there?

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:25.407
Student: $1.60.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:54:25.407 --> 00:54:28.309
$1.60, I'm not doing well here
am I?

00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:33.650
So what am I trying to convince
you to do here?

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:39.190
Let me find some other bidders,
so what did you bid?

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:40.844
Student: $1.00.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:41.870
$1.00, how many coins do you
think were in there?

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.584
Student: $1.25.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:54:45.584 --> 00:54:50.492
$1.25, okay, so how many of
you--be honest now--how many of

00:54:50.492 --> 00:54:54.300
you bid significantly below your
estimate?

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.136
So raise your hands,
how many of you bid below your

00:54:58.136 --> 00:54:59.730
estimate?
Good, so we're learning

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:00.716
something.
I feel like this is the

00:55:00.716 --> 00:55:02.105
twenty-fourth lecture,
I should be able to teach you

00:55:02.105 --> 00:55:04.425
something.
Okay, so the idea here is:

00:55:04.425 --> 00:55:08.280
in a common value auction you
need to shade your bid

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:11.691
considerably.
In fact, most of these bids,

00:55:11.691 --> 00:55:15.622
even though you were shading
your bid considerably,

00:55:15.622 --> 00:55:18.610
most of you didn't shade it
enough.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:21.523
So even taking this into
account, even taking into

00:55:21.523 --> 00:55:24.972
account the lesson of the day,
even with that into account,

00:55:24.972 --> 00:55:27.470
a number of you are still
overbidding.

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:32.351
So what's the take away lesson?
If you're in a common value

00:55:32.351 --> 00:55:38.027
auction, you need to bid as if
you have been told that your

00:55:38.027 --> 00:55:41.550
estimate is the highest
estimate.

00:55:41.550 --> 00:55:45.079
That means you need to shade
your estimate a lot.

00:55:45.079 --> 00:55:48.528
If you don't do this you'll win
a lot of auctions,

00:55:48.528 --> 00:55:54.499
and you'll be very unhappy.
All right, now we're not done

00:55:54.499 --> 00:56:02.630
here, let me move forward by
moving away now just from common

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:06.528
value auctions.
So far we've focused on common

00:56:06.528 --> 00:56:09.445
value auctions and we've focused
on a particular structure of

00:56:09.445 --> 00:56:12.177
auction.
But I also want to talk about

00:56:12.177 --> 00:56:15.891
different types of auctions
themselves because one

00:56:15.891 --> 00:56:20.211
phenomenon you're going to be
seeing out there a lot these

00:56:20.211 --> 00:56:23.697
days is that people run
different structures of

00:56:23.697 --> 00:56:26.057
auctions.
And auctions are getting more

00:56:26.057 --> 00:56:27.639
and more important in the U.S.
economy.

00:56:27.639 --> 00:56:30.182
It used to be that auctions
were something you thought of as

00:56:30.182 --> 00:56:32.992
a pretty rare event.
You'd see them when people were

00:56:32.992 --> 00:56:35.696
selling cattle,
and you'd see them people were

00:56:35.696 --> 00:56:38.280
selling art but that was pretty
much it.

00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.000
But now you see auctions
everywhere.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:42.564
We see auctions on eBay.
We see auctions for the

00:56:42.564 --> 00:56:44.525
spectrum.
Pretty much everything is

00:56:44.525 --> 00:56:46.635
auctioned these days.
So auctions are becoming

00:56:46.635 --> 00:56:48.946
important.
In fact, at Yale this year,

00:56:48.946 --> 00:56:51.949
we had a class solely devoted
to auctions.

00:56:51.949 --> 00:56:55.070
We're having one day of this
class devoted to auctions,

00:56:55.070 --> 00:56:57.613
but they had a whole 24
lectures on auctions,

00:56:57.613 --> 00:57:01.085
it's that important.
One thing we should realize is

00:57:01.085 --> 00:57:04.699
that there are lots of different
types of auctions.

00:57:04.699 --> 00:57:09.060
So let's talk about four
different types of auctions.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:15.861
Let's call them A, B, C, and D.
So the first type of auction is

00:57:15.861 --> 00:57:21.690
a first-price,
sealed-bid auction.

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:24.786
And that's what we just did.
Everybody wrote down their bid

00:57:24.786 --> 00:57:28.339
on a piece of paper.
And the winner was the person

00:57:28.339 --> 00:57:32.247
with the highest bid,
and they paid their bid:

00:57:32.247 --> 00:57:37.477
Ashley in the first case,
Jonathon in the second--Robert

00:57:37.477 --> 00:57:40.785
in the second one.
So a first-priced sealed-bid

00:57:40.785 --> 00:57:43.857
auction is what we just did,
and that's a typical auction

00:57:43.857 --> 00:57:45.283
you might see,
for example,

00:57:45.283 --> 00:57:50.477
in house sales.
Here's another type of auction

00:57:50.477 --> 00:57:53.455
though.
So this sounds crazy,

00:57:53.455 --> 00:57:58.169
but let me write it up anyway.
You could imagine a

00:57:58.169 --> 00:58:02.605
second-price sealed-bid auction.
So what happens in a

00:58:02.605 --> 00:58:04.449
second-price,
sealed-bid auction?

00:58:04.449 --> 00:58:07.971
Everybody writes down their
bid, each player writes down

00:58:07.971 --> 00:58:11.431
their bid.
The highest bidder gets the

00:58:11.431 --> 00:58:15.019
goods so that's the same as
before.

00:58:15.019 --> 00:58:21.205
But now instead of paying the
bid that they wrote down,

00:58:21.205 --> 00:58:25.099
they pay the second highest
bid.

00:58:25.099 --> 00:58:38.340
So the idea is the winner pays
the second bid.

00:58:38.340 --> 00:58:40.199
The winner is the person with
the highest bid,

00:58:40.199 --> 00:58:43.760
but they pay the second bid.
So that seems crazy doesn't it?

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.777
It seems a bit crazy.
These are sometimes called

00:58:47.777 --> 00:58:51.396
Vickrey auctions.
And Vickrey won the Nobel

00:58:51.396 --> 00:58:53.460
Prize, so it can't be that
crazy.

00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.550
We'll come back and talk about
it.

00:58:55.550 --> 00:58:59.170
Here's two other kinds of
auctions.

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:07.010
We can think about an ascending
open auction.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:09.429
So this is what you all think
of when we say auction.

00:59:09.429 --> 00:59:11.719
This is what happens at a
cattle auction or an art

00:59:11.719 --> 00:59:14.010
auction, in which people are
shouting out bids.

00:59:14.010 --> 00:59:17.743
One way to think about this is,
if we were auctioning off

00:59:17.743 --> 00:59:21.961
something in the class today,
is that everybody who is still

00:59:21.961 --> 00:59:25.190
in the auction would raise their
hands, and,

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.871
as the bid got higher and
higher, some of you would start

00:59:27.871 --> 00:59:29.609
dropping out.
And eventually,

00:59:29.609 --> 00:59:33.482
when there's only one hand
left, that person would win the

00:59:33.482 --> 00:59:35.420
auction.
Is that right?

00:59:35.420 --> 00:59:38.579
So that's a version of an
ascending open auction.

00:59:38.579 --> 00:59:40.795
Everybody raises their hands
when the price is 0 and,

00:59:40.795 --> 00:59:42.840
as the price goes up,
hands go down until there's

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:46.927
only one hand left.
But we can also imagine another

00:59:46.927 --> 00:59:50.937
crazy auction,
which is a descending open

00:59:50.937 --> 00:59:54.473
auction.
So how does a descending open

00:59:54.473 --> 00:59:59.506
auction--So I should just say
this open ascending one is what

00:59:59.506 --> 01:00:03.743
you typically see on eBay.
What's a descending open

01:00:03.743 --> 01:00:05.926
auction?
A descending open auction is

01:00:05.926 --> 01:00:08.024
the same idea,
almost, except instead of

01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:10.230
starting the prices at 0 and
going up,

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:13.550
I'll start the price at
infinity and go down.

01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:17.750
So now, if I start the price at
infinity, none of you have your

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:20.467
hands up I hope.
And then as the price goes

01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:23.750
down, eventually one of you is
going to raise their hands,

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.630
and then you get that good and
pay that amount.

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:30.130
So this auction happens in the
real world.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:34.579
It used to happen in a place
called Filene's Basement.

01:00:34.579 --> 01:00:38.250
When I was a graduate student
struggling to have enough money,

01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:41.559
there was a place in Boston
called Filene's Basement,

01:00:41.559 --> 01:00:44.159
which would sell clothing in
this way.

01:00:44.159 --> 01:00:46.179
So you go and pick out the
suits you needed for your

01:00:46.179 --> 01:00:49.561
horrible job interview,
and the price would come down

01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:54.840
each week, and you'd hope that
no one bought it before you did.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.550
Sometimes it's called a Dutch
auction.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:02.679
So here's four kinds of
auctions.

01:01:02.679 --> 01:01:04.860
Two of them seem pretty
familiar.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:09.886
So A and C sound like familiar
kind of auctions that you're

01:01:09.886 --> 01:01:13.353
used to seeing,
and B and D seem a little

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:15.976
weird.
So the first thing I want to

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:19.929
convince you of is that B and D
are not as weird as they seem.

01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:22.110
So let's look at these crazy
auctions.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:31.909
The first thing I want to claim
is that auction D is really the

01:01:31.909 --> 01:01:36.656
same as auction A.
So let's just remind ourselves

01:01:36.656 --> 01:01:39.560
what those two auctions are.
Auction A is--it's exactly the

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:41.160
auction we just did for the
coins.

01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:45.079
Everybody writes down their bid.
We open all the envelopes.

01:01:45.079 --> 01:01:48.351
And the winner is the person
with the highest bid written

01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:51.709
down, and they pay that.
The descending open auction:

01:01:51.709 --> 01:01:53.286
nobody bids,
nobody bids,

01:01:53.286 --> 01:01:54.863
nobody bids,
nobody bids,

01:01:54.863 --> 01:01:58.739
suddenly somebody bids,
and then they pay that amount.

01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:01.800
Why are those two auctions the
same?

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:07.219
Well, think about that
descending open auction.

01:02:07.219 --> 01:02:10.266
During that descending open
auction, each of you may have

01:02:10.266 --> 01:02:13.366
written down in your head--it's
useful to think of it this

01:02:13.366 --> 01:02:16.793
way--you've written down in your
head the number at which you're

01:02:16.793 --> 01:02:19.519
going to raise your hand.
Is that right?

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:22.162
So when I was a graduate
student waiting for my suit to

01:02:22.162 --> 01:02:24.119
come down in price so I can
afford it,

01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:30.966
and I know what the number is,
and from your point of view,

01:02:30.966 --> 01:02:36.333
that's a sealed bid for me.
At the end of the day whoever

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:39.952
has that highest intended bid,
that highest sealed bid,

01:02:39.952 --> 01:02:43.840
will end up winning the suit
and they'll pay their bid.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.000
So from a strategic point of
view the descending open auction

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.750
and the sealed first price
auction are the same thing.

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:59.581
The person who has the highest
bid, the highest strategy,

01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:01.570
wins.
And they pay their bid.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:06.049
You don't get to see anyone
else's strategy until it's too

01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:09.570
late.
So D is equal to A.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:15.821
What about B and D?
So I claim that B and D are not

01:03:15.821 --> 01:03:20.110
the same but they're very
closely related.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:27.639
Sorry B and C.
So C is what?

01:03:27.639 --> 01:03:30.504
C is our eBay auctions,
our classic auction you're all

01:03:30.504 --> 01:03:33.811
used to playing on eBay.
And B is this slightly crazy

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:37.546
thing where we all write down
bids and the winner is the

01:03:37.546 --> 01:03:41.485
person who has the highest bid
but they only pay the second

01:03:41.485 --> 01:03:44.647
amount.
Now why am I saying that's the

01:03:44.647 --> 01:03:47.699
same as our eBay auction in some
ways?

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:49.590
Well let's think about the eBay
auction.

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:52.962
Here you are playing the eBay
auction, so all of you have your

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:56.389
hands up meaning you're still
in, and the price is going up.

01:03:56.389 --> 01:03:59.323
The price is going up over
time, and all of you have your

01:03:59.323 --> 01:04:02.792
hands up, you're still in.
Each of you has some strategy

01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:06.524
in mind which is what?
The strategy is when am I going

01:04:06.524 --> 01:04:10.936
to lower my hand?
What's the highest price I'm

01:04:10.936 --> 01:04:17.068
going to pay for this object?
So your strategy in the classic

01:04:17.068 --> 01:04:21.043
eBay auction is:
the price at which I lower my

01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:24.144
hand.
Who wins in that open ascending

01:04:24.144 --> 01:04:27.471
auction?
The person who has the highest

01:04:27.471 --> 01:04:30.765
intended bid.
The person whose hand is up at

01:04:30.765 --> 01:04:34.690
the end is the person whose
intended bid is the highest.

01:04:34.690 --> 01:04:41.119
But what amount do they pay?
When does the auction stop?

01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:44.570
It stops when the second to
last hand goes down.

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:49.466
So if I'm the winning bid in an
open ascending auction my hand

01:04:49.466 --> 01:04:51.877
is still up.
You don't know what I was

01:04:51.877 --> 01:04:54.732
wiling to pay.
What I'm actually going to pay

01:04:54.732 --> 01:04:58.480
is the price of the last person
whose hand went down.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.184
I'm going to pay the bid of the
person whose amount that they

01:05:02.184 --> 01:05:05.210
were going to pay is the second
highest amount.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:08.966
Does that make sense?
So in an ascending open auction

01:05:08.966 --> 01:05:12.710
the winner, the person who has
the highest intended bid,

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:18.889
actually pays the highest
intended bid of the second

01:05:18.889 --> 01:05:23.304
highest player.
So an ascending open auction is

01:05:23.304 --> 01:05:27.405
structurally very similar to
these sealed bid auctions,

01:05:27.405 --> 01:05:32.190
which is really why the sealed
bid auctions are interesting.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.494
Now, having said that,
they're not exactly the same,

01:05:35.494 --> 01:05:39.122
and the reason they're not
exactly the same is that if in

01:05:39.122 --> 01:05:42.880
fact the good for sale has
common value then we might learn

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.119
something by the fact that the
hands are up.

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:48.299
So the fact that people's hands
are still up in the open

01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:50.597
auction, whereas you can't see
what people are doing in the

01:05:50.597 --> 01:05:53.611
sealed auction,
makes these not identical,

01:05:53.611 --> 01:05:58.219
but there's clearly a close
similarity between them.

01:05:58.219 --> 01:06:01.719
Now, let's ask,
I guess, the question you've

01:06:01.719 --> 01:06:05.707
been wondering about,
which is how should I bid at

01:06:05.707 --> 01:06:08.491
eBay?
We figured out that for the

01:06:08.491 --> 01:06:11.607
common value auction on eBay,
for example,

01:06:11.607 --> 01:06:16.090
if the good you're buying is a
good you're later on going to

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:20.317
want to resell,
in that case we already know

01:06:20.317 --> 01:06:24.862
that you should shade your
estimate of the value

01:06:24.862 --> 01:06:28.126
considerably.
So let's go to the other

01:06:28.126 --> 01:06:36.893
extreme.
Let's consider a private value

01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:44.264
auction.
There's no common value here at

01:06:44.264 --> 01:06:53.816
all and let's assume that this
auction is either second-price

01:06:53.816 --> 01:07:00.073
sealed-bid or open ascending.
To summarize,

01:07:00.073 --> 01:07:04.190
it's either what we call B or
what we call C.

01:07:04.190 --> 01:07:06.655
So there you are,
you're bidding on eBay,

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:10.169
and it's a private value good:
there's nothing interesting

01:07:10.169 --> 01:07:13.190
about how much anyone else
values this thing.

01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:18.200
So what's your value?
Your value is V_i.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:24.680
You might bid B_i.
So this is your value.

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:31.949
Your bid is B_i.
And what's your payoff?

01:07:31.949 --> 01:07:38.357
Your payoff is V_i
minus--it's not minus

01:07:38.357 --> 01:07:41.460
B_i.
What's it minus?

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.514
It's going to be minus
B_jbar,

01:07:44.514 --> 01:07:47.489
and I'll say what it is in a
minute.

01:07:47.489 --> 01:07:49.811
So your payoff is:
the value of the good to you

01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:52.687
minus this thing I'm going to
call B_jbar (which

01:07:52.687 --> 01:07:55.110
I'll say what it is in a minute)
if you win,

01:07:55.110 --> 01:08:03.870
so if B_i is highest.
And it's 0 otherwise.

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:08.110
Is that right?
So what's B_jbar?

01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:20.340
B_jbar is the highest
other bid.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:25.240
So if my bid is the highest,
my final payoff is the value of

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:30.306
the good to me minus the highest
other bid, the second highest

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:33.310
bid, in other words.
So question,

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:38.278
how should I bid either on eBay
here or for that matter in a

01:08:38.278 --> 01:08:41.782
second-priced,
sealed-bid auction:

01:08:41.782 --> 01:08:46.910
what's the right way to bid in
these auctions?

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:49.760
Should I bid my value?
Should I bid under my value?

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.004
Let's have a poll.
Who thinks you should bid over

01:08:54.004 --> 01:08:56.820
your--you're only going to pay
the second price--so who thinks

01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:00.390
you should pay over your value?
Who thinks you should bid over

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:03.208
your value?
Who thinks you should bid your

01:09:03.208 --> 01:09:05.850
value?
Who thinks you should bid under

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.078
your value?
Everyone knows this that's

01:09:08.078 --> 01:09:09.840
good, okay good,
that's correct.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:18.210
So the optimal thing to do is
bid your value.

01:09:18.210 --> 01:09:22.364
Actually we can do better than
that, we can show--we haven't

01:09:22.364 --> 01:09:26.377
got time now--but we can show
that bidding your value in a

01:09:26.377 --> 01:09:30.250
second price auction is a weakly
dominant strategy.

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:42.050
So setting B_i =
V_i is weakly

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:46.026
dominant.
It's a weakly dominant

01:09:46.026 --> 01:09:49.840
strategy:.
so it's really a very good idea.

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.012
So there's nothing subtle about
bidding on eBay if it's truly a

01:09:53.012 --> 01:09:55.854
private value auction.
You're going to stay in until

01:09:55.854 --> 01:09:58.859
it hits your value and then
you're going to drop out.

01:09:58.859 --> 01:10:02.939
I'll leave proving that as an
exercise.

01:10:02.939 --> 01:10:09.752
What about if we switch from
the second price auction,

01:10:09.752 --> 01:10:14.380
or eBay, to a first-price
auction?

01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:26.006
So now your payoff is
V_i minus your own bid

01:10:26.006 --> 01:10:32.227
if you win and 0 otherwise.
So the first price auction

01:10:32.227 --> 01:10:35.753
you're going to get your value
minus your own bid if you win,

01:10:35.753 --> 01:10:38.350
and 0 otherwise.
Now how should you bid?

01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:39.953
Remember this is a private
value auction,

01:10:39.953 --> 01:10:42.039
so you don't have to worry
anymore about the winner's

01:10:42.039 --> 01:10:43.671
curse.
But nevertheless,

01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:46.271
how should you bid?
Should you bid more than your

01:10:46.271 --> 01:10:48.687
value?
Should you bid the same as your

01:10:48.687 --> 01:10:50.789
value?
Or should you bid less than

01:10:50.789 --> 01:10:52.907
your value?
Who thinks you should bid more

01:10:52.907 --> 01:10:55.340
than your value?
Let's have a poll.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.380
Who thinks you should bid your
value?

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:01.220
Who thinks you should bid less
than your value?

01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:03.235
Yeah, the answer is:
here you should bid less than

01:11:03.235 --> 01:11:06.310
your value.
Let's see why.

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:09.220
Bid less than V_i.
Why?

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.187
Because if you bid
V_i,

01:11:11.187 --> 01:11:15.000
even if you win the auction,
what's going to be your payoff?

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.201
0.
If you lose the auction you get

01:11:18.201 --> 01:11:19.850
0, if you win the auction you
get 0.

01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:22.031
If you bid less than
V_i,

01:11:22.031 --> 01:11:24.918
if you shade your bid a bit,
then, if you win,

01:11:24.918 --> 01:11:28.511
which will happen with some
probability, you'll make some

01:11:28.511 --> 01:11:32.239
surplus.
So here it's flipped around.

01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:43.622
Here it turns out that bidding
your value in the first-price

01:11:43.622 --> 01:11:51.080
auction is weakly dominated.
All right, where are we.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.006
We haven't gotten much time.
We want to get one more thing

01:11:53.006 --> 01:11:54.779
out of the class,
so where are we here?

01:11:54.779 --> 01:11:58.188
What we've argued is:
in a second-price auction

01:11:58.188 --> 01:12:02.707
you're going to bid your value,
but the winner's only going to

01:12:02.707 --> 01:12:06.772
pay the second price.
In a first price auction you're

01:12:06.772 --> 01:12:09.770
going to shade your bid under
your value.

01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:12.100
You're going to trade off two
things.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:14.465
The two things you're going to
trade off are:

01:12:14.465 --> 01:12:17.260
as you raise your bid,
you'll increase your chance of

01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.626
winning the auction,
but you'll get less surplus if

01:12:20.626 --> 01:12:22.861
you win.
So the first-price auction is a

01:12:22.861 --> 01:12:25.304
classic trade off:
marginal benefit and marginal

01:12:25.304 --> 01:12:26.871
cost.
The marginal benefit of raising

01:12:26.871 --> 01:12:28.840
your bid is you increase the
probability of winning.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:32.829
The marginal cost is you'll get
less surplus if you win.

01:12:32.829 --> 01:12:36.909
But in summary,
in the second-price auction I

01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:42.472
bid "truthfully my value," but
if I win I only pay the second

01:12:42.472 --> 01:12:45.684
price.
In the first price auction I

01:12:45.684 --> 01:12:50.090
bid less than my value but I pay
what I bid if I win.

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:52.739
That leads us to the natural
question.

01:12:52.739 --> 01:12:58.378
Which of these two auctions,
at least in expectation,

01:12:58.378 --> 01:13:04.569
is going to raise more money?
Let's make some assumptions.

01:13:04.569 --> 01:13:09.050
Let's assume that it's a purely
private value environment.

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:12.881
And let's also assume that
these values are completely

01:13:12.881 --> 01:13:16.712
independent, that my value is
statistically completely

01:13:16.712 --> 01:13:20.254
independent of your value:
they're just completely

01:13:20.254 --> 01:13:23.127
idiosyncratic.
Let's assume that we're all

01:13:23.127 --> 01:13:25.399
kind of basically similar except
for that.

01:13:25.399 --> 01:13:27.521
So I'm going to assume
independence,

01:13:27.521 --> 01:13:30.552
symmetry, private values:
most simple thing you can

01:13:30.552 --> 01:13:33.270
imagine.
Let's ask the question again.

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:36.894
So I'm selling the good now,
would I rather sell this as a

01:13:36.894 --> 01:13:40.964
second-price auction in which at
least you'll bid your values but

01:13:40.964 --> 01:13:43.890
the winner will only pay the
second value;

01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:48.126
or would I rather sell it as a
first price auction in which

01:13:48.126 --> 01:13:52.655
you're all going to shade your
values because of this effect of

01:13:52.655 --> 01:13:56.455
trying to get some surplus,
but at least the winner will

01:13:56.455 --> 01:13:59.687
actually pay you what they bid.
Which is going to generate more

01:13:59.687 --> 01:14:01.449
revenue for me?
Let's have a poll.

01:14:01.449 --> 01:14:04.714
Who thinks I should sell
it--Who thinks I'll get more

01:14:04.714 --> 01:14:07.100
revenue from a second price
auction?

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:11.333
Who thinks I'll get more
revenue from a first price

01:14:11.333 --> 01:14:13.891
auction?
This is the last poll of the

01:14:13.891 --> 01:14:15.125
class.
We can surely get no

01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:16.806
abstentions here.
Let's try it again,

01:14:16.806 --> 01:14:18.719
no abstentions:
last poll of the class,

01:14:18.719 --> 01:14:22.265
last poll of the whole course.
Who thinks I can expect more

01:14:22.265 --> 01:14:26.238
revenue from a second price
auction in which people will bid

01:14:26.238 --> 01:14:29.470
their values but I only get the
second price?

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:32.850
Who thinks I get more revenue
from a first price auction in

01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:36.579
which people pay what they bid,
but they all shade their bids?

01:14:36.579 --> 01:14:39.260
There's a slight majority of
the second price.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:44.029
So here's a great theorem.
Provided we're in the setting I

01:14:44.029 --> 01:14:47.399
said--pure private value,
absolutely independent,

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:49.399
my value is completely
statistically independent of

01:14:49.399 --> 01:14:51.760
your value, and we're all
basically similar--independent,

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:54.762
symmetric, private value--both
of those type of auctions we

01:14:54.762 --> 01:14:57.558
mentioned, the first price
auction and the second price

01:14:57.558 --> 01:15:00.303
auction,
and indeed, any other kind of

01:15:00.303 --> 01:15:04.109
auction which has the property
that in equilibrium,

01:15:04.109 --> 01:15:06.750
the person with the highest
value ends up winning the good.

01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:13.979
Any such auction in expectation
yields exactly the same revenue,

01:15:13.979 --> 01:15:17.275
in expectation.
The first price auction,

01:15:17.275 --> 01:15:20.583
the second price auction--or
any other silly old auction you

01:15:20.583 --> 01:15:23.433
come up with,
at least it has the property

01:15:23.433 --> 01:15:26.921
that in equilibrium,
the highest value wins--all of

01:15:26.921 --> 01:15:30.340
them generate the same revenue
in expectation.

01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:33.469
But to find out why,
you're going to have to take

01:15:33.469 --> 01:15:39.120
another class in Game Theory.
We're done and I will see you

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.653
at the review session.

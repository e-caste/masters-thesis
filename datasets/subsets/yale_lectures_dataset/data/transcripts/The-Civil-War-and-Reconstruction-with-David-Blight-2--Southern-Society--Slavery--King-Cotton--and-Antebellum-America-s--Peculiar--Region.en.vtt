00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.190
Professor David Blight:
Well, go South with me today.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.059
We're going to take up this
question initially of--it's an

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:24.160
old, old, old American
question--how peculiar,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.724
or distinctive,
or different is the American

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:33.726
South?
That used to be a question you

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:39.631
could ask in quite some comfort.
The "Dixie difference," as a

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:44.915
recent book title called it,
or "Dixie rising" as another

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:49.137
recent book title called it.
The South, of course,

00:00:49.137 --> 00:00:51.300
is many, many,
many things and many,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.170
many, many peoples.
There are so many South's today

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.462
that it has rendered this
question in some ways almost

00:00:59.462 --> 00:01:01.891
irrelevant, but,
in other ways,

00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.119
of course not.
We still keep finding our

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.390
presidential elections won or
lost in the South.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.981
Name me a modern American
president who won the presidency

00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:22.180
without at least some success in
the states of the old

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.450
Confederacy.
Look at the great realignments

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.031
in American political history.
They've had a great deal to do

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:38.080
with the way the South would go,
or parts of the South would go.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.968
We're on the verge now of the
first southern primary in this

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:44.457
year's election,
in South Carolina,

00:01:44.457 --> 00:01:52.278
and everybody is wondering,
is there a new modern South

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:57.474
Carolina or not?
Now, this question is fun to

00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:01.927
have fun with in some ways
because it's fraught with

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:07.474
stereotypes, isn't it?
The South: hot,

00:02:07.474 --> 00:02:15.774
slow, long vowels,
great storytellers,

00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:20.754
and so on.
Oh, and they love violence and

00:02:20.754 --> 00:02:24.195
football and stockcar racing,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:27.315
et cetera.
Well I grew up in Michigan and

00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:30.875
I can assure you that
Michiganders love all those

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.620
things too and probably even
more.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.012
But the idea of Southern
stereotypes is very,

00:02:36.012 --> 00:02:38.387
very old.
It isn't a product of the Civil

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.275
War by any means.
The South as an idea,

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:45.340
the South and its
distinctiveness was very much

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.610
there even in the Colonial
Period.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.101
Travelers from England and
elsewhere, France,

00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:54.214
who would come to the American
colonies and would travel

00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:58.026
throughout the colonies,
would often comment on this,

00:02:58.026 --> 00:03:02.160
that somehow Southerners were
different culturally,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.537
attitudinally, behaviorally.
And none other than Thomas

00:03:09.537 --> 00:03:14.814
Jefferson himself left this
famous description of

00:03:14.814 --> 00:03:20.530
characterizations of Southerners
and Northerners.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.827
He wrote this in the mid-1780s.
He was writing to a foreign--a

00:03:26.827 --> 00:03:30.841
French--correspondent.
And Thomas Jefferson described

00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:33.220
the people of the North--this
was in the 1780s now,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.044
this is before the cotton boom
and all that--he described the

00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:42.151
people of the North this way.
Jefferson: "Northerners are

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.210
cool, sober, laborious,
persevering,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:51.597
independent,
jealous of their own liberties,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:57.480
chicaning, superstitious,
and hypocritical in their

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.750
religion."
Take that Yankees.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.358
But Southerners,
he said, "they are fiery,

00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:11.530
voluptuous, indolent,
unsteady, independent,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.051
zealous of their own
liberties"--he changed jealous

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:22.302
to zealous there.
If we're doing close readings

00:04:22.302 --> 00:04:28.500
we might go into that for twenty
minutes, but we're not.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.263
He's not over:
"zealous of their own liberties

00:04:32.263 --> 00:04:35.190
but trampling on those of
others,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.334
generous, candid and without
attachment or pretensions to any

00:04:41.334 --> 00:04:45.430
religion but that of their own
heart."

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.689
Now we can debate what
Jefferson got right or wrong

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:54.532
there, or what's held up,
but do note how he said both

00:04:54.532 --> 00:05:00.069
sides were either jealous or
zealous of their own liberties.

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:03.956
That could be an epigraph on
this course, if you like,

00:05:03.956 --> 00:05:08.356
because in the end when this
Civil War will finally come both

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:12.829
sides will say over and over and
over again that they are only

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:14.810
fighting for liberty.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.237
Everybody in the Civil War will
say they're fighting for

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:22.870
liberty.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.977
In one of the greatest books
ever written on the South,

00:05:30.977 --> 00:05:34.733
by a Southerner,
in particular Wilbur Cash's

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:40.149
great classic in 1940 called
The Mind of the South,

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:45.121
he did something similar to
Jefferson, although he's

00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:48.629
focusing only on Southerners
here.

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.227
Cash was a great journalist,
intellectual historian in his

00:05:53.227 --> 00:05:57.259
own right, deeply critical of
his beloved South.

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.033
In fact it was Cash who wrote a
book called The Mind of the

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:04.683
South in which he argued,
in part, that the South had no

00:06:04.683 --> 00:06:08.649
mind.
He didn't really mean it.

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.042
He said Southerners are "proud,
brave, honorable by its"--The

00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.912
South is "proud,
brave, honorable by its lights,

00:06:14.912 --> 00:06:18.079
courteous, personally generous,
loyal, swift to act,

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:21.470
often too swift,
but signally effective,

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.600
sometimes terrible in its
actions.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.235
Such was the South at its
best," said Cash,

00:06:28.235 --> 00:06:31.870
"and such at its best it
remains today."

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.127
Then comes a "but."
But the South,

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:38.398
he says, is also characterized
by, quote, "violence,

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:41.556
intolerance,
aversion, suspicion toward new

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:45.728
ideas, an incapability for
analysis, an inclination to act

00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:48.730
from feeling rather than from
thought,

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.384
attachment to fictions and
false values,

00:06:52.384 --> 00:06:58.099
above all too great attachment
to racial values and a tendency

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:01.660
to justify cruelty and
injustice."

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.538
Some of the South's greatest
critics, of course,

00:07:06.538 --> 00:07:12.132
have been Southerners.
What's distinctive about the

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:15.899
South, especially this Old
South?

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:19.430
There's Shelby Foote to comment
on this.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.859
None other than Shelby the star
of Ken Burns' film series on the

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:26.491
Civil War, that lovely,
lovely, lovely geriatric in a

00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:30.563
blue shirt that American women
fell in love with in a

00:07:30.563 --> 00:07:34.095
documentary film.
It's the only time in recorded

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:38.290
history that anyone fell in love
with anybody in a documentary.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.990
Shelby Foote said this--and who
is he speaking for?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.805
"I'm not aware that there is
such a thing as Southern art,"

00:07:47.805 --> 00:07:53.120
said Shelby, "at least not if
you're defining it by technique.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:59.975
If there's something distinct
about it"--Southern art--"it's

00:07:59.975 --> 00:08:04.740
subject matter and also inner
heritage.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:09.923
All Southerners who try to
express themselves in art are

00:08:09.923 --> 00:08:14.730
very much aware that they are
party to a defeat."

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:25.129
Now, that's Shelby Foote
speaking for white Southerners.

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:28.841
And when Shelby Foote uses the
term 'Southerner' he means white

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:31.500
Southerners.
But party to a defeat.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.114
Or as Walker Percy,
the great Southern writer,

00:08:34.114 --> 00:08:37.543
was once asked--he was asked,
in effect, "why do Southerners

00:08:37.543 --> 00:08:40.538
have such long memories?
They don't seem to forget

00:08:40.538 --> 00:08:42.272
anything."
And he gave a simple,

00:08:42.272 --> 00:08:48.082
straight, declarative answer.
He said, "Because we lost the

00:08:48.082 --> 00:08:50.990
war."
We lost.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.908
Loss always,
I think, almost always,

00:08:54.908 --> 00:09:00.171
especially in modern history,
has led to longer,

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:04.860
deeper, troubled memories.
But Shelby wasn't speaking for

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.847
all Southerners there.
Toni Morrison was speaking for

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:11.521
black Southerners in that,
I think, fantastic line in her

00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:15.522
novel Beloved--which I
know many of you've read because

00:09:15.522 --> 00:09:19.327
it's taught all the time--but
there's that marvelous little

00:09:19.327 --> 00:09:22.870
exchange at one point between
Paul D and Sethe.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.657
And Paul D and Sethe are trying
to imagine a new life out of the

00:09:26.657 --> 00:09:30.220
horror of their past,
and at one point Paul D simply

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.780
says to Sethe--Sethe,
of course, is a former slave

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:38.140
woman who birthed this child
which becomes this extraordinary

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.614
ghost called Beloved,
and Paul D was a former slave

00:09:42.614 --> 00:09:47.427
who survived the worst
brutalities of slavery and worse

00:09:47.427 --> 00:09:51.259
than chain gangs and so on and
so forth.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:55.932
But at one point he just says
to her, "Me and you Sethe,

00:09:55.932 --> 00:10:00.350
we got too much yesterday,
we need more tomorrow."

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:06.909
Too much yesterday,
we need more tomorrow.

00:10:06.909 --> 00:10:10.259
Why does the South have such a
long memory?

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:14.732
Why is history and memory
sometimes a deep family matter,

00:10:14.732 --> 00:10:18.523
to Southerners?
Whereas it isn't necessarily to

00:10:18.523 --> 00:10:22.716
Northerners, or so it seems.
Faulkner captured this,

00:10:22.716 --> 00:10:26.299
Faulkner captured this all over
the place.

00:10:26.299 --> 00:10:28.876
But I have a favorite line in
his novel called The

00:10:28.876 --> 00:10:31.799
Hamlet, where Faulkner has
one of his characters say,

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:35.061
and I quote:
"Only thank God men have done

00:10:35.061 --> 00:10:39.674
learned how to forget quick what
they ain't brave enough to

00:10:39.674 --> 00:10:40.470
cure."

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.683
Can't cure it,
can't solve it,

00:10:46.683 --> 00:10:50.509
can't get rid of it?
Forget it.

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:53.594
Or try to forget it,
or work on forgetting it,

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:56.200
or create a structure of
forgetting;

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.035
which is, of course,
always a structure of

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:01.180
remembering at the same time.

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:07.854
And then lastly there's Allan
Gurganus, that wonderful Modern

00:11:07.854 --> 00:11:11.031
Southern writer who wrote that
book called The Oldest

00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:15.546
Confederate Widow Tells All,
you know that bizarre--it's a

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:17.957
wonderful read.
We've always been looking for

00:11:17.957 --> 00:11:20.130
the oldest Confederate widow,
in case you haven't noticed.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:23.352
They keep finding one.
The latest was just found

00:11:23.352 --> 00:11:26.035
another five years or so.
She was, I don't know,

00:11:26.035 --> 00:11:29.661
ninety and she married some
sixty-year-old Confederate

00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:33.500
veteran at some point in time.
We're always finding some woman

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.510
alive who claims she was married
to a Confederate soldier.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.615
I don't know precisely why.
That's one for an

00:11:39.615 --> 00:11:42.826
anthropologist to figure out.
But Allan Gurganus,

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:46.512
he actually said this in The
New York Times in a

00:11:46.512 --> 00:11:49.720
commentary he wrote on the
Confederate flag,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.256
where as a Southern writer back
during--oh about five to six

00:11:53.256 --> 00:11:56.613
years ago--during the worst of
the controversies over the

00:11:56.613 --> 00:12:00.150
Confederate flag flying on the
South Carolina capitol and so

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.368
on,
Gurganus wrote this wonderfully

00:12:02.368 --> 00:12:05.510
witty, wry, brilliant op-ed
piece, long op-ed in The New

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:08.597
York Times where he talked
about the depth of Southern

00:12:08.597 --> 00:12:11.629
memory and why Southerners have
such deep memories,

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:16.119
and then he begged his fellow
Southerners to fold that battle

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:21.135
flag and put it in museums.
But the line I wrote down out

00:12:21.135 --> 00:12:25.527
of that piece was this.
What's distinctive about the

00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:29.240
South: "The South has a
tradition," said Gurganus,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.361
"of attempting the impossible
at great cost,

00:12:33.361 --> 00:12:36.620
proudly celebrating the
failure,

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.250
and in gaining admiration for
the performance."

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.799
Trying something,
failing gloriously at it,

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:52.860
and then getting everybody's
admiration.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.214
If that's not a novelist's
description of what a lost cause

00:12:56.214 --> 00:12:57.660
is I've never read one.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.239
One could go on and on here.
In some ways the most

00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:10.241
distinctive literature America
has is a kind of Southern

00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:14.866
literature, white and black.
Every major African-American

00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:18.929
writer of the twentieth century,
at least until your lifetime,

00:13:18.929 --> 00:13:22.764
when black writers in this
country are now born and raised

00:13:22.764 --> 00:13:26.665
in cities, in California or
Minneapolis or New York or--and

00:13:26.665 --> 00:13:30.769
in modern Atlanta and they come
from all the same places other

00:13:30.769 --> 00:13:33.403
Americas do.
Sometimes they come from the

00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:36.590
Caribbean and become Americans.
But that's recent.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:42.549
Every major African-American
poet and writer and artist from

00:13:42.549 --> 00:13:47.801
frankly the mid-nineteenth
century on has always been

00:13:47.801 --> 00:13:52.649
reflecting on this nexus of
North and South.

00:13:52.649 --> 00:13:57.404
South to a Very Old
Place as in Albert Murray's

00:13:57.404 --> 00:14:01.129
famous book.
Trouble the Water;

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:04.492
a novel about growing up in the
South by Melvin Dixon,

00:14:04.492 --> 00:14:07.220
a great novel that gets little
attention,

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:11.993
and his lifelong struggle to
understand just how Southern he

00:14:11.993 --> 00:14:15.894
was in New York.
Ralph Ellison's famous musings

00:14:15.894 --> 00:14:18.990
on being a Southerner come to
Harlem;

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:25.167
and on and on and on.
But let's go back to the Old

00:14:25.167 --> 00:14:29.574
South, this Old South that got
the United States in so much

00:14:29.574 --> 00:14:32.529
trouble.
Although it wasn't all their

00:14:32.529 --> 00:14:34.298
fault.
First of all,

00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:38.778
it's worth remembering there
are a lot of clear,

00:14:38.778 --> 00:14:42.590
undeniable similarities of all
kinds,

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:48.170
things you can measure,
between South and North in the

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:53.778
40 years before the Civil War.
The North and the South had

00:14:53.778 --> 00:14:57.425
roughly, as the Northern and
Southern states,

00:14:57.425 --> 00:15:01.819
the Free states and Slave
states, had roughly the same

00:15:01.819 --> 00:15:05.431
geographic size.
They spoke the same language,

00:15:05.431 --> 00:15:08.851
English, although in very
different regional dialects,

00:15:08.851 --> 00:15:11.184
of course.
They had common heroes and

00:15:11.184 --> 00:15:14.575
common customs and a certain
common heritage of the American

00:15:14.575 --> 00:15:17.059
Revolution;
make no mistake.

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.201
John C.
Calhoun, one of the great

00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:22.749
intellectual architects of
Southern distinctiveness or

00:15:22.749 --> 00:15:27.110
Southern sectionalism,
and certainly of Southern

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:32.247
States' Rights doctrine,
was very much an American

00:15:32.247 --> 00:15:35.884
nationalist,
at least in the early parts of

00:15:35.884 --> 00:15:38.373
his career.
Northerners and Southerners

00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:41.391
shared basically the same
Protestant Christianity,

00:15:41.391 --> 00:15:44.039
although they used it in
different ways.

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:48.313
They had very similar political
ideologies, borne of the

00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:51.653
republicanism,
they all kind of breathed in-

00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:55.390
that was breathed into them,
and they inherited from the age

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.893
of the American Revolution.
A fierce belief in individual

00:15:58.893 --> 00:16:02.291
liberty.
When you hear a slaveholder

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:07.220
preach about his individual
liberty and his rights,

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.854
you sometimes wonder,
"come on, where do you get

00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:14.727
off?"
But as many of you know,

00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:19.290
and certainly you will find out
here, they had pretty clear

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.010
ideas of who ought to have those
individual liberties and who

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:28.599
would not,
who indeed were born equal and

00:16:28.599 --> 00:16:31.260
who were not.
Both shared,

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.526
both sides, the leadership of
both sides, shared a rich kind

00:16:36.526 --> 00:16:40.899
of nationalism about this
American experiment.

00:16:40.899 --> 00:16:44.721
You can find a whole- you can
sort of find a deep and abiding

00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:48.478
kind of American nationalism
still in a lot of these budding

00:16:48.478 --> 00:16:51.370
Southern patriots,
even by the 1850s,

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.091
especially when they get scared
about what secession might

00:16:56.091 --> 00:16:59.031
actually mean.
You could argue that both

00:16:59.031 --> 00:17:02.278
Southerners and Northerners
shared a certain degree of

00:17:02.278 --> 00:17:05.710
old-fashioned American localism,
attachment to place.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.648
New Englanders know something
about attachment to place,

00:17:09.648 --> 00:17:13.730
and so did people from the low
country, South Carolina.

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.025
States' Rights was nothing that
the South owned either,

00:17:18.025 --> 00:17:21.373
of course.
Some of the most open exercises

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:25.079
of states' rights,
of course, before the 1850s,

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:28.753
were conducted by Northerners,
like in the Hartford Convention

00:17:28.753 --> 00:17:32.126
of 1814, like in personal
liberty laws that we'll come to

00:17:32.126 --> 00:17:34.443
a bit later.
In resistance to the Fugitive

00:17:34.443 --> 00:17:37.336
Slave Act the state of Wisconsin
enacted a Personal Liberty Law

00:17:37.336 --> 00:17:40.230
that said they were not going to
enforce the Fugitive Slave Act

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.559
and turn in fugitive slaves,
and the justification was that

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:48.000
it was their state's right to do
so.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.920
So it isn't just States' Rights
that's distinctively Southern.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:54.683
Southerners shared with
Northerners a faith in progress,

00:17:54.683 --> 00:17:58.789
if you breathed the air in
American in the 1840s and '50s.

00:17:58.789 --> 00:18:03.389
The idea that America stood for
some kind of progress,

00:18:03.389 --> 00:18:08.769
that America meant a prosperous
future was just common coin.

00:18:08.769 --> 00:18:13.035
And both Southerners and
Northerners shared both the

00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:17.299
reality and the spirit of that
westward movement.

00:18:17.299 --> 00:18:21.453
Both had participated in what
David Donald used to call the

00:18:21.453 --> 00:18:25.393
great American practice or
custom, tradition actually he

00:18:25.393 --> 00:18:27.470
called it, of compromise.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.399
And both sides,
both North and South,

00:18:34.399 --> 00:18:39.410
in their political leadership,
in their economic leadership,

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:44.930
were led by hard-boiled,
believing, practicing,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.586
capitalists.
Southern slave-holders were not

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:52.042
pre-capitalists.
There's historical scholarship

00:18:52.042 --> 00:18:56.077
that used to argue that a couple
of generations ago,

00:18:56.077 --> 00:19:00.660
but not anymore.
And throw this statistic up.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.168
You could argue that both sides
had essentially the same kind of

00:19:05.168 --> 00:19:08.021
oligarchies.
Less than one percent,

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:12.819
less than one percent of the
real and personal property,

00:19:12.819 --> 00:19:18.400
in both South and North by the
1850s, was held by approximately

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.640
fifty percent of free adult
males.

00:19:26.009 --> 00:19:30.138
The richest one percent in both
sections, put another way,

00:19:30.138 --> 00:19:33.470
held twenty-seven percent of
all the wealth.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:39.273
The North had budding
oligarchies, just like the South

00:19:39.273 --> 00:19:42.143
did.
Now those oligarchies were

00:19:42.143 --> 00:19:47.079
based on different things,
and that's where the rub came.

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:49.410
A little more on this distinct
South.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.755
I said earlier that this is an
old idea, I mean it goes back

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:57.954
into the eighteenth--you can
find all kinds of examples of

00:19:57.954 --> 00:20:02.300
these stereotypical conceptions
of the South in French,

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.393
British visitors.
One of the most famous,

00:20:05.393 --> 00:20:07.229
Hector St.
John de Crèvecoeur,

00:20:07.229 --> 00:20:09.984
who in his famous fictional
letters, Letters from an

00:20:09.984 --> 00:20:13.525
American Farmer,
he invented a character,

00:20:13.525 --> 00:20:19.000
if you've ever read that great
text, called Farmer James.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.840
His typical American farmer,
Farmer James,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:26.306
was of course a
Pennsylvanian--sturdy,

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:30.240
probably had some German blood
in him.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.792
Crèvecoeur made the
North the site of the true

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:37.890
essence of what he saw as this
new American man being born in

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.460
America, not in the South.
He traveled in the South.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.593
He likened Charleston,
South Carolina though--this was

00:20:44.593 --> 00:20:46.839
in the 1780s--he likened
Charleston,

00:20:46.839 --> 00:20:50.072
South Carolina to what he
called, quote,

00:20:50.072 --> 00:20:53.470
"the barbarous institutions and
traits,

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:58.013
especially slavery,
the self-indulgence of the

00:20:58.013 --> 00:21:02.960
planters"--and then he
concludes--"just like Lima,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.878
Peru."
That's the only known

00:21:05.878 --> 00:21:11.150
comparison of Charleston to
Lima, Peru that I'm aware of.

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:13.598
Oh and on and on and on.
There were travelers from

00:21:13.598 --> 00:21:16.569
Europe who came and would write
these stereotypic stories.

00:21:16.569 --> 00:21:20.044
There's one by an English
traveler, he entitled it,

00:21:20.044 --> 00:21:23.380
"A Georgia Planter's Method of
Spending Time."

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:27.058
And it's this litany of how a
Georgia planter gets up early,

00:21:27.058 --> 00:21:29.240
has his first draught of
whiskey,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.256
talks to his overseer,
has another draught of whiskey,

00:21:33.256 --> 00:21:37.391
eight o'clock has breakfast,
another draught of whiskey,

00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:40.839
and the day goes on--talks to
his overseer again,

00:21:40.839 --> 00:21:43.470
gets things started on the
plantation that day,

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.529
and then he goes into the
village,

00:21:45.529 --> 00:21:51.080
to the tavern,
to start drinking.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.261
Lots of these.
Most importantly,

00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:58.737
seriously, the idea of the
South as exotic,

00:21:58.737 --> 00:22:03.319
different, and dangerous is an
old idea.

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:09.115
A new layer of danger sort of
was put on top of images of the

00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:12.980
South--not just in Northerners'
minds,

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.405
for that matter--after the
great Haitian Revolution,

00:22:17.405 --> 00:22:22.439
after the slave rebels of San
Domingue made Haiti the first

00:22:22.439 --> 00:22:25.650
black republic in modern
history,

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:29.403
and some of those Haitian
rebels ended up in the American

00:22:29.403 --> 00:22:31.683
south.
In the imagination of white

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:35.492
Southerners there were a lot
more Haitian rebels coming into

00:22:35.492 --> 00:22:38.140
the South than actually ever got
here.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.097
But then if you look at the
writings of New Englanders,

00:22:41.097 --> 00:22:42.960
by the early nineteenth
century.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.089
Take Jedidiah Morse,
for example,

00:22:45.089 --> 00:22:48.623
the great geographer.
He called the North a,

00:22:48.623 --> 00:22:53.084
quote, "happy state of
mediocrity, a hardy race of

00:22:53.084 --> 00:22:57.883
free, independent republicans."
And isn't that the image that

00:22:57.883 --> 00:23:00.349
New Englanders always want of
themselves?

00:23:00.349 --> 00:23:05.249
They don't share anything,
but they're free and

00:23:05.249 --> 00:23:09.096
independent.
When my wife and I first moved

00:23:09.096 --> 00:23:13.651
to Amherst, Massachusetts--I
took a job there once--we took

00:23:13.651 --> 00:23:16.950
some baked goods over to our
neighbors.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:20.180
And we'd been warned about New
Englanders and all that.

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.977
But we delivered the baked
goods and said,

00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:26.329
"Hi, how are you?
We're here now."

00:23:26.329 --> 00:23:32.460
And the woman said in effect,
"Why have you brought this?"

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.609
Anyway.
Sorry.

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:39.576
Jedidiah Morse described
Southerners however as,

00:23:39.576 --> 00:23:43.710
"disconsolent"--"represented,"
he said, by, quote,

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.930
"disconsolent wildness and
popular ignorance."

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:52.561
Noah Webster,
of the great dictionary fame,

00:23:52.561 --> 00:23:55.869
said famously,
"Oh New England,

00:23:55.869 --> 00:24:01.272
how superior are thy habits in
morals, literature,

00:24:01.272 --> 00:24:07.527
civility and industry."
So, comparing the North and the

00:24:07.527 --> 00:24:13.444
South, try and understand how
difference eventually does boil

00:24:13.444 --> 00:24:18.246
into political crisis,
which eventually boils into

00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:22.400
conflict, which eventually boils
into disunion,

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:29.287
which eventually boils into
war, does have some root back in

00:24:29.287 --> 00:24:33.839
these kinds of perceived
differences.

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:38.545
As one of my favorite
historians warned me once,

00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:45.609
"don't leave out the politics."
Don't leave out politics.

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:50.790
Now, if I could hang your hat
on one kind of Southern

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:55.374
distinctiveness,
perhaps above all--it's fun to

00:24:55.374 --> 00:25:01.152
play with all these stereotypes
and realize that if so many

00:25:01.152 --> 00:25:06.334
people were writing this way,
from personal observation,

00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:09.920
yes, there must be something to
all these differences.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.232
But what eventually evolved in
the South--and we will return to

00:25:14.232 --> 00:25:18.057
this a good deal next Tuesday
when I'll devote an entire

00:25:18.057 --> 00:25:21.674
lecture to this kind of
slaveholder worldview and the

00:25:21.674 --> 00:25:25.360
pro-slavery argument--the
pro-slavery defense--and how

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.559
that evolved into a political
culture.

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:32.800
But if there's one thing--and
this is a little risky because

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.113
there are always holes in any
claim like this--but if there's

00:25:37.113 --> 00:25:41.354
one distinct feature of the Old
South society and indeed its

00:25:41.354 --> 00:25:44.230
leadership and most of its
people,

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.009
it would be what we might label
anti-modernism.

00:25:49.009 --> 00:25:55.061
It was a society that
eventually developed a disdain

00:25:55.061 --> 00:26:01.114
for what they perceived as the
corruptions of modern

00:26:01.114 --> 00:26:05.253
commercialism.
Southern slaveholding

00:26:05.253 --> 00:26:10.310
leadership, in particular,
were very suspicious of the

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:14.135
spread of literacy.
They were very suspicious of

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:16.724
the democratic tendencies,
or so it seemed,

00:26:16.724 --> 00:26:20.361
the democratic tendencies of
that northern society which was

00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:24.316
spreading literacy more widely,
and eventually the right to

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:27.339
vote more widely,
at least among white people.

00:26:27.339 --> 00:26:29.618
It is a society where the
leadership for sure,

00:26:29.618 --> 00:26:33.929
and much of the non-leadership,
were suspicious of reform,

00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:39.410
suspicious of change,
suspicious of democracy itself.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:43.991
Democracy, the slaveholding
class of the South came to

00:26:43.991 --> 00:26:47.190
see--small d--as a dangerous
thing.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:51.083
It was a threat to hierarchy
and the South became quite

00:26:51.083 --> 00:26:54.615
distinctively a very
hierarchical society--more on

00:26:54.615 --> 00:26:58.571
that in just a second.
It became a hierarchical

00:26:58.571 --> 00:27:03.603
society rooted very deeply in
open conceptions of class and

00:27:03.603 --> 00:27:06.900
obviously open conceptions of
race.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.602
Some were born to rule.
In the overall attitude of the

00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:15.182
planter class and the leadership
class of the American South by

00:27:15.182 --> 00:27:18.895
the 1840s and 1850s,
some were born to rule and some

00:27:18.895 --> 00:27:22.080
born to be ruled.
Deal with it,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:27.183
was their attitude.
They became deeply protective

00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:31.770
and insistent upon their own
peculiar sense--and there's a

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.920
great scholarship on this--their
own peculiar sense of honor.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.557
Honor.
That old-fashioned

00:27:39.557 --> 00:27:42.369
concept--it's an old-fashioned
word.

00:27:42.369 --> 00:27:45.160
How many of you even use that
word anymore?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.329
"Do the honorable thing."
Ah.

00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:53.089
"Oh, I didn't act today with
much honor did I?"

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:55.240
We're more likely to--we have
other words for it now.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:59.427
What would the--?
We might say class -- "we did

00:27:59.427 --> 00:28:04.910
that with class."
Or being effective.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.359
I don't know,
what would a synonym today be

00:28:07.359 --> 00:28:08.060
for honor?

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.090
Anyone?
A good synonym for honor.

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:24.230
"A person of character."
Oh, I don't know.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.290
Work on that, will you?
A synonym for honor.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:30.027
Well, honor in the Old South.
There's a whole vast

00:28:30.027 --> 00:28:33.524
scholarship on this and two or
three of the teaching assistants

00:28:33.524 --> 00:28:35.779
in this class are real experts
on it.

00:28:35.779 --> 00:28:39.500
So check it out with Steve and
Sam and others.

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.220
But it was essentially a set of
values, and it was a deeply

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:48.289
rooted set of values in the
planters' worldview.

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:52.000
It was a form of behavior,
demeanor.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.065
Yes, it meant a certain kind of
gentleman's understanding of

00:28:57.065 --> 00:28:59.316
behavior.
It was the idea that a

00:28:59.316 --> 00:29:02.990
gentleman must be honest.
A gentleman must be trustworthy.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.240
A gentleman was a man of
entitlement.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.789
A gentleman was a man of
property.

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:11.690
A gentleman had class,
rank, and status,

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:17.751
and you better recognize it.
And the most important thing in

00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:22.492
the Southern code of honor,
I think, safe to say,

00:29:22.492 --> 00:29:26.572
was reputation.
A man of honor must be

00:29:26.572 --> 00:29:30.130
recognized, must be
acknowledged.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:35.809
And indeed there must be
virtually a ritual of that

00:29:35.809 --> 00:29:38.781
recognition.
Now, honor's alive and well

00:29:38.781 --> 00:29:40.880
around the world today,
make no mistake.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.209
It's alive and well in
diplomacy, it's alive and well

00:29:44.209 --> 00:29:47.932
in many, many cultures.
I was part of a huge conference

00:29:47.932 --> 00:29:51.903
last summer in West Africa on
the end of the slave-trade in

00:29:51.903 --> 00:29:54.099
Ghana,
and we had representatives--we

00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:57.047
had people participating in that
conference from 15 or 16

00:29:57.047 --> 00:29:59.997
different African countries.
We had African chieftains

00:29:59.997 --> 00:30:02.686
involved, we had the
Vice-President of Ghana and the

00:30:02.686 --> 00:30:04.900
President of Togo and on and on
and on.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:08.023
We spent an entire day doing
nothing but bowing and doing

00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:09.542
honor.
And for Americans,

00:30:09.542 --> 00:30:12.999
all our democratic experience
and do I have to put a tie on

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.400
for this event or not?
This kind of ritual honor all

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.352
the time--I mean after all we
have a president who just likes

00:30:20.352 --> 00:30:23.645
to speak like a Texan,
he doesn't do all that honor

00:30:23.645 --> 00:30:24.370
stuff.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.165
I'm sorry, if I'm going to do
Bush I got to work on that,

00:30:30.165 --> 00:30:32.220
don't I?
That's terrible.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.000
Who's that guy that does those
commercials?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.519
He's brilliant at Bush.
Forget it, anyway.

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:43.106
James Henry Hammond of South
Carolina once said,

00:30:43.106 --> 00:30:45.930
I quote, "Reputation is
everything.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:51.662
Everything with me depends upon
the estimation in which I am

00:30:51.662 --> 00:30:59.259
held."
That's honor, personal honor.

00:30:59.259 --> 00:31:03.631
For many Southerners it was
more important than law,

00:31:03.631 --> 00:31:07.840
more important than conscience.
And when they started

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.326
encountering these Northerners,
whether they were from

00:31:11.326 --> 00:31:15.644
Massachusetts or Ohio,
who started talking about a

00:31:15.644 --> 00:31:20.003
politics of conscience,
or a politics of law,

00:31:20.003 --> 00:31:24.660
they're not always talking on
the same page.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.593
So anti-modernism and honor are
two hooks you can hang your hats

00:31:31.593 --> 00:31:32.902
on.
There are all those other

00:31:32.902 --> 00:31:34.578
claims.
The South is distinctive

00:31:34.578 --> 00:31:36.544
because of its climate,
hot weather,

00:31:36.544 --> 00:31:38.509
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:31:38.509 --> 00:31:40.884
There's book after book after
book on this,

00:31:40.884 --> 00:31:42.920
like Clarence Cason's famous
book,

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.149
90 Degrees in the Shade,
which is supposed to explain

00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:50.674
all Southern behavior and ideas.
Ruralness is often used to

00:31:50.674 --> 00:31:56.925
explain the distinctiveness of
Southern writing and art and so

00:31:56.925 --> 00:31:59.923
on.
I do love Eudora Welty's

00:31:59.923 --> 00:32:03.835
description of this.
She didn't just say it's all

00:32:03.835 --> 00:32:08.429
because the South is rural.
But Eudora Welty was once asked

00:32:08.429 --> 00:32:12.093
why Southerners can be such
great writers,

00:32:12.093 --> 00:32:17.990
or such good storytellers--and
she was a wonderful storyteller.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.660
Her answer was this--and it's
got something to do with how a

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:27.251
lost cause took hold too--but
she said, "Southerners love a

00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:29.930
good tale.
They are born reciters,

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.456
great memory retainers,
diary keepers,

00:32:32.456 --> 00:32:35.119
letter exchangers and letter
savers,

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:39.632
history tracers and debaters,
and outstaying all the rest

00:32:39.632 --> 00:32:42.130
they are just great talkers."

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.876
Now I've met a few New
Englanders who were good talkers

00:32:49.876 --> 00:32:52.619
too.
Then there's this issue of

00:32:52.619 --> 00:32:55.828
conservatism.
Why is the South the seat of

00:32:55.828 --> 00:32:59.473
American conservatism?
Why did a Southern strategy in

00:32:59.473 --> 00:33:03.374
modern American political
history re-invent the Republican

00:33:03.374 --> 00:33:06.180
Party?
Even though some defenders of

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.730
that particular movement claim
it didn't happen,

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:13.507
like David Brooks tried to
claim in The New York

00:33:13.507 --> 00:33:16.190
Times.
David Brooks is a revisionist.

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:25.396
Well, the taproot of
conservatism you could say is

00:33:25.396 --> 00:33:31.701
right there in the Old South.
It's exactly what Wilbur Cash

00:33:31.701 --> 00:33:34.595
once said.
He said, "If you want to

00:33:34.595 --> 00:33:38.160
understand the South," he said,
"its taproot is back there in

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:41.681
the Old South."
We so long had this game of

00:33:41.681 --> 00:33:46.675
sort of always looking for the
central theme of Southern

00:33:46.675 --> 00:33:50.579
history, the central theme of
the South.

00:33:50.579 --> 00:33:57.399
And so often it does come back
to this overall claim of a kind

00:33:57.399 --> 00:34:00.666
of anti-reform,
sometimes even

00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:04.865
anti-intellectual,
conservative defense of a

00:34:04.865 --> 00:34:10.137
hierarchical civilization rooted
in white supremacy and

00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:14.273
originally,
indeed, in one of the biggest

00:34:14.273 --> 00:34:18.000
slave systems the world had ever
created.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.059
And there's the old business
about violence.

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:24.552
You can go way--there's lots of
books on this and articles on

00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:26.457
this;
why cockfighting was more

00:34:26.457 --> 00:34:29.152
popular in the South,
why country fighting and

00:34:29.152 --> 00:34:31.183
eye-gouging was--.
Elliott Gorn,

00:34:31.183 --> 00:34:34.278
a wonderful historian up at
Brown, wrote a brilliant,

00:34:34.278 --> 00:34:36.599
fascinating,
half-crazy essay once about

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:38.920
eye-gouging and Southern
fighting.

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:45.226
And I don't know,
I used to love to quote from it

00:34:45.226 --> 00:34:47.815
but then I began to realize I'm
only quoting that because it's

00:34:47.815 --> 00:34:49.469
about a guy's eye being gouged
out.

00:34:49.469 --> 00:34:54.280
So that's--I'm not going to do
that anymore.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.950
Now, C.
Vann Woodward weighed in on

00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:01.349
this, a great historian,
worked here much of his life.

00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:04.842
But he said,
you know, finally the South--he

00:35:04.842 --> 00:35:09.471
said, finally the South got
liberated from being the place

00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:12.719
that America always dumped its
sins.

00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:15.610
In his famous book of essays,
The Burden of Southern

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.280
History.
among many other things he

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.565
argued that the South actually
had the chance to finally be

00:35:22.565 --> 00:35:26.850
liberated from being the seat of
all of America's sins,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.250
by three things.
And he didn't live long enough

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:33.345
quite to--well he actually lived
long enough but he didn't really

00:35:33.345 --> 00:35:36.246
write about what I would add as
a fourth one--but he said the

00:35:36.246 --> 00:35:39.390
Civil Rights revolution finally
began to liberate the South.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.396
And concomitantly a second
reason is that that Civil Rights

00:35:45.396 --> 00:35:48.005
revolution also brought,
through its process,

00:35:48.005 --> 00:35:51.295
a huge discovery at the same
time of Northern racism,

00:35:51.295 --> 00:35:54.965
when Martin Luther King brought
the movement to Chicago and

00:35:54.965 --> 00:35:56.990
nearly got killed doing it.

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:04.326
And in a thousand other ways
Americans realized racism isn't

00:36:04.326 --> 00:36:06.516
a Southern thing,
it's everywhere,

00:36:06.516 --> 00:36:10.429
belongs to everyone.
And then Woodward argued quite

00:36:10.429 --> 00:36:14.914
directly that the loss of the
Vietnam War began to liberate

00:36:14.914 --> 00:36:17.993
the South,
in a sense that the South,

00:36:17.993 --> 00:36:20.385
Southerners,
white Southerners,

00:36:20.385 --> 00:36:25.010
were the only Americans other
than--we always forget Native

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.199
Americans--who had ever lost a
war.

00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:31.751
And that a burden was taken off
the South by the loss of that

00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:33.719
Vietnam War.
Now, that's a debatable

00:36:33.719 --> 00:36:36.476
subject, isn't it?
Because there's a broad

00:36:36.476 --> 00:36:40.520
revisionism about Vietnam.
Ronald Reagan argued it was our

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.458
noble cause in Vietnam.
We could've won,

00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:45.919
should've won,
were winning,

00:36:45.919 --> 00:36:50.347
and so on and so forth.
There's even a fourth idea you

00:36:50.347 --> 00:36:54.600
might add to how the South may
have been a little bit liberated

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.578
from this past by what has
happened in just the last twenty

00:36:58.578 --> 00:37:02.420
to twenty-five years of American
political history,

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.843
and economic history,
with Sunbelt migration,

00:37:05.843 --> 00:37:10.590
with Southern industrialization
and post-industrialization,

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:14.570
with massive immigration now
from around the world;

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:19.742
large Vietnamese populations in
Louisiana, large Hispanic

00:37:19.742 --> 00:37:25.376
populations in North Carolina,
a huge Cuban and other Hispanic

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:29.000
populations in Florida.
You have a very,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.956
very changing demographic
situation in the American South

00:37:32.956 --> 00:37:36.630
and its political culture has to
respond to that.

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.667
So we may live,
in your lifetime,

00:37:39.667 --> 00:37:45.457
to a time when this burden of
Southern history may get all but

00:37:45.457 --> 00:37:49.159
lifted altogether from
Southerners,

00:37:49.159 --> 00:37:55.840
unless we don't forget the
Civil War.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:59.943
And we don't seem to forget it.
As I said the other day if that

00:37:59.943 --> 00:38:03.110
Confederate flag would just go
away, just vanish,

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:07.494
just stick it in the basement
of museums and no one would ever

00:38:07.494 --> 00:38:13.984
care about it anymore,
maybe, maybe the South's burden

00:38:13.984 --> 00:38:17.634
would go away.
But there's another kind of

00:38:17.634 --> 00:38:20.621
burden, and again Woodward and
many others have written about

00:38:20.621 --> 00:38:22.978
this.
One of the most distinctive

00:38:22.978 --> 00:38:27.329
things about Southern--the
South, is of course its history,

00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:29.730
not just its culture,
not just its attitudes,

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.141
not just its behavior;
not the kind of stuff that

00:38:33.141 --> 00:38:35.889
what's his name,
John Shelton Reed,

00:38:35.889 --> 00:38:39.604
the great sociologist,
is always doing these surveys

00:38:39.604 --> 00:38:42.410
of attitudes about Southerners,
of Southerners,

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:46.998
by Southerners.
But let's remember the South

00:38:46.998 --> 00:38:53.126
had a distinctive history.
The antebellum Southern economy

00:38:53.126 --> 00:38:57.023
became by the 1820s,
without any question,

00:38:57.023 --> 00:39:01.134
a slave economy.
And by the 1820s and 1830s the

00:39:01.134 --> 00:39:05.590
American South became what I
think you could safely say was

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.970
the fifth slave society in human
history;

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:11.800
maybe the sixth.
This is debatable.

00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:18.600
Now, for a long time in
American scholarship and in

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:22.500
American classrooms one of the
deep mythologies about this

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.469
whole story of the era of the
American Civil War in the Old

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:30.368
South is that the Old South's
plantation economy was dying

00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:33.267
out.
Soil was being eroded and

00:39:33.267 --> 00:39:37.922
wasted along the Eastern
seaboard, and they were using up

00:39:37.922 --> 00:39:42.410
the great soils of the
Mississippi Valley and over time

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:47.480
that slave system just somehow
wasn't going to work out.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:52.050
Now Ulrich Phillips argued this
years and years and years ago.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.863
Others argued it from real
research, but along came Robert

00:39:55.863 --> 00:39:59.878
Fogel and Stanley Engerman and a
generation of other scholars

00:39:59.878 --> 00:40:03.014
from the 1960s on,
and there were people even

00:40:03.014 --> 00:40:06.405
before them who looked at the
Southern economy through

00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:10.181
cleometrics and statistics and a
broad swath of new economic

00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:15.736
historical methods and analyses,
and they discovered that--sorry

00:40:15.736 --> 00:40:19.949
folks--slavery was extremely
profitable.

00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:22.976
The Southern economy,
thank you very much,

00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:26.244
was booming.
The South had its greatest

00:40:26.244 --> 00:40:30.548
cotton crop ever in 1860.
It was affected by the major

00:40:30.548 --> 00:40:34.389
American depressions of
1837,1857, but not as much as

00:40:34.389 --> 00:40:35.350
the North.

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:43.344
And, lo and behold,
that idea we had of the

00:40:43.344 --> 00:40:46.570
Southern planter as this--oh,
you know,

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:51.642
kind of anti-modern--don't give
up entirely on the anti-modern

00:40:51.642 --> 00:40:56.216
label, I think there's still
something to that--but that

00:40:56.216 --> 00:41:00.456
anti-modern kind of
backward-looking planter who--he

00:41:00.456 --> 00:41:03.699
didn't really like world
markets,

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:06.964
he didn't like railroads and
trains and all that stuff,

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:10.591
he just wanted to make a decent
little living if he could off

00:41:10.591 --> 00:41:14.097
growing some hemp and some
tobacco and some indigo and some

00:41:14.097 --> 00:41:17.320
rice and some cotton,
and he was good to his slaves.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:23.139
They had a bad break coming
from Africa but that's the way

00:41:23.139 --> 00:41:25.969
it goes.
Uh-uh.

00:41:25.969 --> 00:41:28.899
We now know,
if we know anything about the

00:41:28.899 --> 00:41:31.900
Old South, the average American
planter,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.697
the average American
slaveholder, small ones and big

00:41:35.697 --> 00:41:39.725
ones, were raging capitalists.
They understood markets,

00:41:39.725 --> 00:41:43.486
they understood profits.
They were men of rational

00:41:43.486 --> 00:41:48.561
choice, and the way to wealth in
the American South--the way to

00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:51.225
wealth,
even before the cotton gin but

00:41:51.225 --> 00:41:53.869
especially after Eli Whitney's
cotton gin;

00:41:53.869 --> 00:41:56.933
and by the way folks,
everybody knows Eli Whitney

00:41:56.933 --> 00:42:00.825
invented the cotton gin and it
was originally this little box,

00:42:00.825 --> 00:42:03.633
smaller than this lectern.
If you don't know

00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:06.893
that--somebody should've taught
you that in the 6^(th) Grade or

00:42:06.893 --> 00:42:09.679
the 4^(th) Grade or the 1^(st)
Grade or somewhere.

00:42:09.679 --> 00:42:13.312
Good old Eli Whitney,
it's his fault we had the

00:42:13.312 --> 00:42:18.051
cotton boom and slavery grew,
and you get sort of Eli Whitney

00:42:18.051 --> 00:42:22.374
to the Civil War.
And then we have a great war

00:42:22.374 --> 00:42:25.800
for weeks and it's all Eli
Whitney.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.539
He's buried right across the
street.

00:42:28.539 --> 00:42:33.853
Go into Grove Street Cemetery
some--go visit his grave and

00:42:33.853 --> 00:42:39.629
say, "It's not your fault Eli."
"It's okay, 'cuz them planters,

00:42:39.629 --> 00:42:44.070
they were raging capitalists
just waitin' for you.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:45.750
All you did is give 'em a
machine."

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:53.565
The way to wealth.
Faulkner wrote about this too

00:42:53.565 --> 00:42:56.684
in that immortal character he
created in Thomas Sutpen in

00:42:56.684 --> 00:42:59.469
Absalom, Absalom! Who was
Thomas Sutpen?

00:42:59.469 --> 00:43:02.345
Thomas Sutpen is that guy who
arrives out in Alabama with a

00:43:02.345 --> 00:43:04.079
group of Haitian slaves with
him.

00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:07.289
He treats them like an absolute
tyrant.

00:43:07.289 --> 00:43:11.695
He carves down the forest,
he begins to cultivate the land

00:43:11.695 --> 00:43:16.565
and he declares what you got to
have for success in the South is

00:43:16.565 --> 00:43:19.330
"a house,
some land and some niggers."

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:26.562
That's another one of those
sentences by Faulkner that sort

00:43:26.562 --> 00:43:29.469
of captured this spirit of
Alabama Fever,

00:43:29.469 --> 00:43:31.496
as it was called,
in the 1820s and '30s,

00:43:31.496 --> 00:43:33.420
and Mississippi Fever in the
1830s,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.554
Louisiana/Texas Fever by the
18--well Louisiana Fever is even

00:43:37.554 --> 00:43:40.309
earlier--but Texas Fever by the
1840s.

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:46.730
The land was so rich and it was
really cheap at first.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:54.560
Now, how powerful was the
cotton boom once it took hold?

00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:04.418
This powerful.
Sea Island cotton,

00:44:04.418 --> 00:44:08.150
the kind of cotton grown down
there in the Georgia--where it

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.440
was first grown in North
America--in the Georgia,

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:16.112
South Carolina islands,
was a kind of long and silky

00:44:16.112 --> 00:44:19.597
kind of cotton.
They weren't very successful in

00:44:19.597 --> 00:44:23.079
growing it in huge amounts,
but that short stapled cotton

00:44:23.079 --> 00:44:26.935
that eventually was the form of
cotton that the cotton gin made

00:44:26.935 --> 00:44:31.623
into such a massive,
marketable world product,

00:44:31.623 --> 00:44:36.010
is what made the cotton boom
boom.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.462
By the 1820s,
already, within a decade of the

00:44:39.462 --> 00:44:42.836
War of 1812 and the opening of
the frontier,

00:44:42.836 --> 00:44:45.739
cotton's future seemed
limitless.

00:44:45.739 --> 00:44:49.164
And one of the best analogies
you can think of is the oil rich

00:44:49.164 --> 00:44:51.690
nations of the world in
post-World War Two,

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:57.680
in the post-World War Two era,
whether it's Saudi Arabia,

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.889
Iraq and Iran,
the Emirates,

00:45:00.889 --> 00:45:05.840
or Venezuela,
name--today Russia.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.118
If you're an oil rich country
today, as long as that oil

00:45:10.118 --> 00:45:13.930
lasts, you got the world kind of
at your knees.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:18.078
You're in OPEC.
And that is exactly what the

00:45:18.078 --> 00:45:22.064
South began to see itself as,
at least Southern leadership

00:45:22.064 --> 00:45:25.420
began to see itself as,
as early as the 1820s and

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.759
1830s.
The cotton crop nearly doubled

00:45:28.759 --> 00:45:32.894
every decade from 1820 to 1860.
Four decades in a row the

00:45:32.894 --> 00:45:35.460
production of American cotton
nearly doubled.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:39.894
Now think of another product in
American history that doubled

00:45:39.894 --> 00:45:44.705
every decade for four decades,
and then imagine that that

00:45:44.705 --> 00:45:49.030
product became the country's,
without question,

00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:53.170
absolute largest export.
General Motors at its height,

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:56.206
when I was growing up in Flint,
Michigan, in boom times,

00:45:56.206 --> 00:45:58.470
would've wished it could've
said that.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:07.547
Already by 1825--that
early--the South was the world's

00:46:07.547 --> 00:46:11.351
largest supplier of cotton and
fueling now this Industrial

00:46:11.351 --> 00:46:15.222
Revolution in textile production
in Great Britain and other

00:46:15.222 --> 00:46:19.860
places.
And think of it this way.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:21.760
I need a map for this,
excuse me.

00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:55.326
I don't know if you can see
those colors much at all,

00:46:55.326 --> 00:46:58.922
sorry about that.
But what you've got at the top

00:46:58.922 --> 00:47:02.708
are the early 1790s and I think
1820 in terms of slave

00:47:02.708 --> 00:47:05.280
population in the American
south.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.692
But if you look at 1860,
the bottom map,

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:10.289
if you can vaguely see those
deep, dark,

00:47:10.289 --> 00:47:14.124
red areas, you can see where
cotton moved,

00:47:14.124 --> 00:47:18.800
where slavery moved in the
domestic slave trade,

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:23.210
and then where Southern
political power moved.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:25.740
And you will find,
as we will in the next few

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.191
weeks, the Southern political
power by the 1850s and 1860s is

00:47:29.191 --> 00:47:32.797
really no longer in Virginia,
or even South Carolina,

00:47:32.797 --> 00:47:35.469
it's out in the Mississippi
Valley.

00:47:35.469 --> 00:47:38.521
There's a very good reason
Jefferson Davis becomes

00:47:38.521 --> 00:47:40.949
president of the confederacy in
1860.

00:47:40.949 --> 00:47:44.829
It's because he's from
Mississippi.

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:48.340
Now, fortunes were made
overnight;

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:53.358
new wealth, overnight.
A number of men,

00:47:53.358 --> 00:47:57.065
as one historian has written,
I think quite effectively,

00:47:57.065 --> 00:48:00.705
"mounted from log cabin to
mansion"--and I quote--"on a

00:48:00.705 --> 00:48:04.143
stairway of cotton bales
accumulating slaves as they

00:48:04.143 --> 00:48:07.022
went."
If you had five slaves and a

00:48:07.022 --> 00:48:11.598
good piece of land in Alabama in
1820, you might very likely have

00:48:11.598 --> 00:48:15.960
fifty slaves and a hell of a lot
more land a decade later.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:18.546
But it's also worth knowing
that that slaveholding

00:48:18.546 --> 00:48:21.659
population was also fluid,
people moved in and out of it.

00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:27.301
There were approximately
400,000 slaveholders,

00:48:27.301 --> 00:48:33.820
white slaveholders,
in the American South by 1860.

00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:39.663
About one-third of Southern
white families at one time or

00:48:39.663 --> 00:48:45.090
another had at least a toehold
in slave ownership.

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:48.170
That means two-thirds did not,
of course.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:52.165
Two-thirds of the white South
remained in those classes we've

00:48:52.165 --> 00:48:55.541
come to call the yeoman farmers,
the poor whites,

00:48:55.541 --> 00:48:59.500
or the sand hill farmers,
as they were sometimes called.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.254
In certain regions of the
South, the yeoman

00:49:02.254 --> 00:49:05.139
farmer--non-slaveholding,
but land owning,

00:49:05.139 --> 00:49:08.427
usually--and the poor white
farmer--non-slaveholding,

00:49:08.427 --> 00:49:10.639
but usually not even
land-owning,

00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:14.245
usually renting or working for
wage labor--were forty,

00:49:14.245 --> 00:49:18.123
fifty, and even sixty percent
of the white population in a

00:49:18.123 --> 00:49:19.280
given region.

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:27.128
Jefferson Davis is,
in fact, a classic example of

00:49:27.128 --> 00:49:30.831
the cotton boom planter.
He was born in relatively

00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:34.070
meager and humble circumstances
in Kentucky, not what,

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.949
about 80 miles from where
Abraham Lincoln was born,

00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:40.230
in even meagerer circumstances.
But his older brother,

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:44.119
Joseph, went out to Mississippi
and struck it rich in cotton.

00:49:44.119 --> 00:49:47.929
And Jefferson Davis went out to
join him, and Jefferson Davis

00:49:47.929 --> 00:49:52.320
became a millionaire.
On cotton.

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:54.519
Of course Jefferson Davis
really preferred to be a

00:49:54.519 --> 00:49:57.213
military officer and went to
West Point and on and on and on,

00:49:57.213 --> 00:49:59.828
and the rest is history.
My watch says I've run out of

00:49:59.828 --> 00:50:01.010
time.
Now let me leave you with this.

00:50:05.159 --> 00:50:08.244
How successful was the cotton
boom, how important was the

00:50:08.244 --> 00:50:11.273
cotton boom, what is the
relationship between the spread

00:50:11.273 --> 00:50:15.059
of slavery,
the spread of cotton, and power?

00:50:15.059 --> 00:50:19.152
By 1860 there were
approximately 4,000,000 slaves

00:50:19.152 --> 00:50:22.988
in the United States,
the second largest slave

00:50:22.988 --> 00:50:26.739
society--slave population--in
the world.

00:50:26.739 --> 00:50:28.870
The only one larger was Russian
serfdom.

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:32.828
Brazil was close.
But in 1860 American slaves,

00:50:32.828 --> 00:50:37.342
as a financial asset,
were worth approximately three

00:50:37.342 --> 00:50:40.970
and a half billion
dollars--that's just as

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:43.811
property.
Three and a half billion

00:50:43.811 --> 00:50:47.480
dollars was the net worth,
roughly, of slaves in 1860.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:51.959
In today's dollars that would
be approximately seventy-five

00:50:51.959 --> 00:50:55.947
billion dollars.
In 1860 slaves as an asset were

00:50:55.947 --> 00:50:59.969
worth more than all of America's
manufacturing,

00:50:59.969 --> 00:51:04.196
all of the railroads,
all of the productive capacity

00:51:04.196 --> 00:51:07.179
of the United States put
together.

00:51:07.179 --> 00:51:11.423
Slaves were the single largest,
by far, financial asset of

00:51:11.423 --> 00:51:14.550
property in the entire American
economy.

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:19.431
The only thing worth more than
the slaves in the American

00:51:19.431 --> 00:51:23.179
economy of the 1850s was the
land itself,

00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:28.475
and no one can really put a
dollar value on all of the land

00:51:28.475 --> 00:51:32.661
of North America.
If you're looking to begin to

00:51:32.661 --> 00:51:37.650
understand why the South will
begin to defend this system,

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:40.936
and defend this society,
and worry about it shrinking,

00:51:40.936 --> 00:51:44.471
and worry about a political
culture from the North that is

00:51:44.471 --> 00:51:46.889
really beginning to criticize
them,

00:51:46.889 --> 00:51:50.087
think three and a half billion
dollars and the largest

00:51:50.087 --> 00:51:52.380
financial asset in American
society,

00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.750
and what you might even try to
compare that to today.

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.199
Now I'll pick up with this next
Tuesday;

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:04.094
it's a perfect transition into
the pro-slavery argument an the

00:52:04.094 --> 00:52:07.000
southern worldview.
Thank you.

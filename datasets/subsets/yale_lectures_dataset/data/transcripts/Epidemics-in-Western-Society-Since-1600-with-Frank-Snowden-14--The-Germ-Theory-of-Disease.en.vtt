00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:02.920
Prof: Well good morning.
 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.070
I think we should get started.
 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.005
And what we'll be talking about
this morning is the germ theory

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:11.040
of disease.
 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.198
In a sense, it's taken us half
a course to reach a period when

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:21.019
we begin to see the development
of what you would probably

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.910
recognize as a scientific modern
medicine.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.230
To appreciate the enormity of
what happened with the germ

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.820
theory of disease,
I think it's worth casting our

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.710
eye back to a point we had
already reached.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:43.540
Let's say we compared the year
1789 with 1900.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.414
Before 1789,
and the developments with the

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:52.711
Paris School of Medicine,
you'll remember the conceptual

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:58.216
framework was dominated,
still, by that of Hippocrates,

00:00:58.216 --> 00:01:01.210
Galen and humoral medicine.
 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.998
Humoralism was in retreat,
as doctors were absorbing ideas

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:10.620
about the circulatory system,
and the nervous system.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.920
But the medical philosophy,
the vocabulary,

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700
therapeutics and medical
education,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.470
were still cast in the old
framework,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.720
supplemented by other
developments--

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.229
astrology, for example--and
epidemic diseases were thought

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.790
to be explained by the doctrine
of miasma--

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.580
that is, the corruption or
poisoning of the air--

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.510
or malaria, as it was called at
the time.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.456
By 1900, I think it's clear
that more change had occurred

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:49.670
than in all of the centuries
since Hippocrates combined,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.370
and that medical science,
whose basic principles were

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.290
recognizably similar to our own
today,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.830
had emerged.
 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.576
Furthermore,
the speed of change was

00:02:01.576 --> 00:02:06.129
gathering momentum as the
nineteenth century progressed.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:10.945
The closing decades of the
century witnessed a wholesale

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:15.938
revolution, with the germ theory
of disease as its central

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:16.990
feature.
 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.187
This theory,
I'm going to argue,

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:25.550
was as important a revolution
in medicine as for,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.775
example, Galileo's theory of
the rotation of the earth was to

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.163
astronomy;
or perhaps Darwin's theory of

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:36.910
natural selection was to
biology;

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.889
or gravitation to physics.
 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:45.013
So, what I would like to begin
with then is looking at what is

00:02:45.013 --> 00:02:46.229
the germ theory?
 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:48.830
What were its preconditions?
 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.120
Who were the decisive figures?
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.779
What were the decisive events
associated with that famous trio

00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.655
of Louis Pasteur,
Joseph Lister,

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:02.139
Robert Koch?
 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:05.370
What were the implications?
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.703
Let's avoid the idea of a
single genius coming up with a

00:03:11.703 --> 00:03:13.199
great idea.
 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:17.822
Let's question the vision
behind the idea of the Nobel

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:18.520
Prize.
 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.000
I'm going to be arguing that
these discoveries,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.990
that culminate in the germ
theory, had a long gestation

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.425
period,
and were a collective process

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:33.610
that required a long train of
preconditions.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.090
Let's look at the preconditions
first.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.883
I'll argue that they're
conceptual, technological and

00:03:40.883 --> 00:03:42.360
institutional.
 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.690
Let's look at conceptual
preconditions.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.335
The germ theory of disease
didn't arise directly out of

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.169
hospital medicine and the Paris
School,

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.937
but I think it's inconceivable
without the background of that

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.050
development.
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.310
It was crucial to have a
nosology--that is,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.038
disease classification--the
idea of disease specificity--

00:04:06.038 --> 00:04:10.967
that they were specific
entities--and without the idea

00:04:10.967 --> 00:04:14.610
of localism;
that is, lesions.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.822
And also essential was the new
development of pathological

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:26.163
anatomy, derived from the
post-mortem in the Paris

00:04:26.163 --> 00:04:27.689
hospitals.
 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:31.278
The idea of specificity was
critical.

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:36.601
Any further progress to the
idea of a microbial disease

00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:42.019
depended on the view that
diseases didn't transform from

00:04:42.019 --> 00:04:44.089
one into another.
 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:47.019
Before the Paris School,
it was common to believe,

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:51.783
for example,
that cholera--to take one

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:56.863
disease--
was simply a heightened form of

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.819
endemic summer diarrhea.
 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.951
It wasn't a specific disease,
and it grew out of another

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.189
preexisting condition.
 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.276
The germ theory depended
instead on the conviction that

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:14.213
there are stable,
unchanging disease entities,

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:20.399
that each one is specific and
has a specific microbial cause.

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:23.910
But the followers of
Louis--Pierre Louis,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.452
that is--in Paris,
while carefully distinguishing

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:31.524
one disease from another,
and classifying them,

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:37.447
didn't advance much towards the
idea of the causative pathogens

00:05:37.447 --> 00:05:38.879
behind them.
 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.550
Now, when we've talked about
the Paris School,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.574
I don't want to give you the
idea that all of the crucial

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:51.060
figures in disease specificity,
and nosology, were French.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.160
There were other crucial
figures as well.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.642
William Gerhard,
who distinguished typhus from

00:05:58.642 --> 00:05:59.639
typhoid.
 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:04.091
He had studied in Paris with
Louis for a couple of years,

00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:07.829
and then returned to his native
Philadelphia.

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:12.348
During an epidemic of typhus,
he dissected hundreds of

00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:17.463
cadavers and discovered that
their lesions had no resemblance

00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:19.680
whatsoever to typhoid.
 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.867
There was William Budd,
who wrote an important book

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:28.309
called Typhoid Fever:
Its Nature, Mode of Spreading

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:30.990
and Prevention,
in 1873.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.220
And he referred to the
unchanging, specific nature of

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.089
the disease.
 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.629
Let's listen to what he said.
 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.125
He said this:
"To propagate itself and

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:44.339
no other,
and that on a series of

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.444
indefinite progressions,
constitutes the very essence of

00:06:49.444 --> 00:06:54.540
the relation on which the idea
of species is founded.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.579
How much this applies in the
animal and plant world we all

00:06:59.579 --> 00:07:00.199
know.
 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.560
It is strange that what it
implies, in the case of

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:09.810
diseases, should be so seldom
recognized until now."

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.490
Or there was Pierre Bretonneau,
who believed that there were

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.060
morbid seeds that caused special
diseases,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.480
just as every seed--in the
natural history,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.439
that is--gives rise to a
determined species.

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.720
And he applied that idea to
diphtheria.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:35.504
Just so as apples don't turn
into wheat--apples seeds into

00:07:35.504 --> 00:07:42.529
wheat--so too endemic diarrhea
doesn't transform itself into

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:44.910
Asiatic cholera.
 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.180
There was an important
transitional figure too.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.089
Claude Bernard,
of the Paris School,

00:07:51.089 --> 00:07:56.600
one of its stars,
who lived from 1813 to 1878,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:00.982
and in 1865 wrote an important
book called An Introduction

00:08:00.982 --> 00:08:04.269
to the Study of Experimental
Medicine,

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:08.730
where he presented a critique
of the Paris School.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.949
He argued that diseases were
dynamic processes.

00:08:12.949 --> 00:08:18.793
They weren't static in the way
that the Paris idea of nosology

00:08:18.793 --> 00:08:20.709
seemed to suggest.
 

00:08:20.709 --> 00:08:26.293
And he argued that they,
hospitals, displayed the end

00:08:26.293 --> 00:08:30.910
stages of diseases,
not their beginnings.

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:35.861
And he argued that hospitals
and clinics had an excess of

00:08:35.861 --> 00:08:41.081
variables that wasn't helpful
for the further development of

00:08:41.081 --> 00:08:42.850
medical science.
 

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.480
So, he proposed an alternative,
that was embodied in his title;

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.090
that is, experimental medicine.
 

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:52.340
And by that,
he meant laboratory medicine.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.152
He's one of the people who
suggest a new epistemology for

00:08:56.152 --> 00:08:59.822
medicine,
which isn't the hospital ward

00:08:59.822 --> 00:09:03.323
but the lab,
where you could have the

00:09:03.323 --> 00:09:08.017
experimental testing of single
variables in controlled

00:09:08.017 --> 00:09:09.080
settings.
 

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:14.360
Here was a new source of
medical knowledge.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.038
If that provides conceptual
preconditions,

00:09:19.038 --> 00:09:23.259
there were also institutional
ones.

00:09:23.259 --> 00:09:28.179
And here I'm thinking of the
rise of the laboratory,

00:09:28.179 --> 00:09:33.125
of the university;
that is, full-time professional

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:36.335
scientists, research
institutions,

00:09:36.335 --> 00:09:40.908
and Germany leading the way,
rather than France,

00:09:40.908 --> 00:09:43.340
in this development.
 

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.450
There were also technological
foundations.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:52.176
It's impossible to think of the
rise of the germ theory of

00:09:52.176 --> 00:09:55.090
disease without microscopy.
 

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.350
And so it was indebted to Anton
van Leeuwenhoek,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:06.171
who lived from 1632 to 1723,
and developed the simple

00:10:06.171 --> 00:10:07.850
microscope.
 

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.440
And then in the 1820s,
and thereafter,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.995
there were major improvements:
the development of the compound

00:10:14.995 --> 00:10:17.908
microscope and higher
magnification,

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:23.940
the work of the Zeiss Company
and the development of lenses.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.830
There was also,
for a fourth precondition,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:34.047
a lonely, neglected pioneer,
and that was a Hungarian

00:10:34.047 --> 00:10:38.219
gynecologist,
who lived in Vienna,

00:10:38.219 --> 00:10:42.058
called Ignaz Phillip
Semmelweis,

00:10:42.058 --> 00:10:47.730
whose crucial idea,
which dates from the 1840s--

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:53.394
Semmelweis noted that the
infection rate in childbirth was

00:10:53.394 --> 00:10:59.357
much lower on obstetrical wards
where women were delivered by

00:10:59.357 --> 00:11:03.504
midwives,
rather than on wards where they

00:11:03.504 --> 00:11:06.168
were delivered by physicians.
 

00:11:06.168 --> 00:11:09.870
The reason had nothing to do
with their training or relative

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.379
degree of benevolence and
malevolence.

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:17.066
The point was that the
physicians were just returning

00:11:17.066 --> 00:11:21.494
from post-mortem examinations,
from autopsies,

00:11:21.494 --> 00:11:24.210
after which,
at that time,

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:28.482
they didn't wash their hands,
and so they were transmitting

00:11:28.482 --> 00:11:32.692
disease to their patients,
from autopsies they were

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:35.798
performing in an adjacent
building.

00:11:35.798 --> 00:11:38.807
So, Semmelweis,
suspecting--although he didn't

00:11:38.807 --> 00:11:41.895
know the mechanism--
that this was the case,

00:11:41.895 --> 00:11:45.058
established elaborate
hand-washing rituals,

00:11:45.058 --> 00:11:49.532
using a chlorinated lime
solution--a little bit the first

00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:53.841
hand sanitizer,
we might say--and he noted that

00:11:53.841 --> 00:11:59.029
mortality plummeted from twenty
percent to one percent.

00:11:59.029 --> 00:12:02.523
Unfortunately,
his own career was not a happy

00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:03.000
one.
 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.861
He was mocked by his colleagues
as a charlatan,

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:12.830
and was actually demoted in his
own hospital.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.708
Well, then, there's a fifth
precondition,

00:12:15.708 --> 00:12:19.379
and that's the development of
the basic sciences.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:22.971
And it's hard to imagine,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:12:22.971 --> 00:12:27.500
the rival of the germ theory
without chemistry in particular.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.580
The specific issue that gave
rise to the germ theory of

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.120
disease was fermentation.
 

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.113
And Pasteur,
after all, was originally a

00:12:38.113 --> 00:12:42.950
chemist, who in the 1860s became
a biologist, and we should note

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:45.330
that he wasn't a physician.
 

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:53.330
This is to introduce you to
Louis Pasteur.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:58.229
The immediate background to the
germ theory of disease involved

00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:02.890
the dominant theory of the day,
which was called the zymotic

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:08.123
theory of disease;
that is, that it was a form of

00:13:08.123 --> 00:13:14.876
ferment--a little bit like
Pettenkofer had asserted--caused

00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:21.048
by some fermentation of decaying
organic material.

00:13:21.048 --> 00:13:25.533
Under the right conditions of
soil, temperature and moisture,

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:29.193
this fermentation would give
off a poison into the

00:13:29.193 --> 00:13:30.389
environment.
 

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:35.308
Also quite widespread was the
idea of spontaneous generation,

00:13:35.308 --> 00:13:40.505
that diseases arose somehow
spontaneously in a particular

00:13:40.505 --> 00:13:44.312
locality,
weren't brought in or imported

00:13:44.312 --> 00:13:45.928
from the outside.
 

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:52.587
There was a famous experiment
about this, from the seventeenth

00:13:52.587 --> 00:13:53.679
century.
 

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:56.629
It was Redi's maggot experiment.
 

00:13:56.629 --> 00:14:01.256
The idea was that if you could
have rotting meat,

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:06.558
and you could cover it,
you wouldn't develop maggots.

00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:10.855
But if you didn't cover it,
then you would find that it was

00:14:10.855 --> 00:14:12.190
full of maggots.
 

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:16.693
So, the maggots didn't appear
in the rotting meat by some

00:14:16.693 --> 00:14:20.234
internal mechanism of
spontaneous generation,

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:23.048
but were imported from outside.
 

00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:26.308
And Pasteur,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:14:26.308 --> 00:14:30.801
takes up this very idea,
to the idea that germs too,

00:14:30.801 --> 00:14:35.029
like the maggots,
are imported from outside.

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:40.538
The immediate issue for Pasteur
was in fact fermentation.

00:14:40.538 --> 00:14:46.145
He began by studying the
fermentation of wine and beer,

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:49.779
and in particular their
spoilage.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:51.735
At the time,
this was thought,

00:14:51.735 --> 00:14:55.308
when he took up his work,
to be a chemical process.

00:14:55.308 --> 00:15:00.129
And remember that Pasteur was
not a physician but a chemist

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:01.210
originally.
 

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:06.470
Well, what he did was to
discover that the fermentation

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.048
was caused instead by living
microorganisms,

00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:15.690
bacteria that he identified
through the microscope.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:20.048
Now, this was a high-profile
investigation in the 1860s,

00:15:20.048 --> 00:15:24.847
for the simple reason that the
production of wine and beer

00:15:24.847 --> 00:15:29.308
involved two of France's major
economic activities.

00:15:29.308 --> 00:15:35.549
Pasteur--and this was part of
his genius--immediately made a

00:15:35.549 --> 00:15:38.298
far-reaching connection.
 

00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:41.860
In his estimate,
the fermentation that he saw in

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.365
wine and beer,
now caused by bacteria,

00:15:45.365 --> 00:15:50.759
was analogous to putrefaction
and infection in wounds,

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.590
for example.
 

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:58.067
So, he began to regard disease
as a process involving

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:01.440
microorganisms,
living things.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.811
This was work that Pasteur
conducted in the late 1850s and

00:16:06.811 --> 00:16:09.352
1860s,
and it marked the first

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:13.548
transformation in his career
from that of a chemist into a

00:16:13.548 --> 00:16:17.126
biologist,
or we might say today a

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:18.899
microbiologist.
 

00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:21.178
He examined not only wine and
beer,

00:16:21.178 --> 00:16:26.330
he then turned his attention to
milk and its souring,

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.408
and he wrote a book on that,
and then a study on wine and a

00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:32.808
study on beer.
 

00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:37.105
Now, of great importance was
the fact that Pasteur's

00:16:37.105 --> 00:16:41.990
discovery that abnormal
fermentation leads to spoilage,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:45.710
along with that went another
discovery he made,

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:50.710
which was that this process
could be controlled by heat.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:55.966
Here was a major public health
discovery, and that led to the

00:16:55.966 --> 00:16:59.470
process we now know as
pasteurization.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:05.578
So, already in the 1860s,
Pasteur was busily transforming

00:17:05.578 --> 00:17:06.670
biology.
 

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:12.401
Even if had he stopped then,
his discoveries were already

00:17:12.401 --> 00:17:16.700
those of a fully productive
life's work.

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:22.109
But then in the 1860s came a
turn in Pasteur's interests from

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:27.430
biology, more specifically to
medicine and public health.

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:32.338
And he began to study
spontaneous generation.

00:17:32.338 --> 00:17:40.480
Now, followers of Pasteur
believed instead in biogenesis.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.767
With regard to cholera,
that we already examined,

00:17:44.767 --> 00:17:50.126
about which there was a debate,
the idea was that cholera was

00:17:50.126 --> 00:17:52.450
imported from outside.
 

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.490
It didn't arise spontaneously.
 

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.463
It wasn't the transformation of
some other disease that already

00:18:00.463 --> 00:18:02.308
existed into cholera.
 

00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:07.201
Rather it was a specific
disease that could not arise as

00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:11.470
a heightened form of a
pre-existing condition.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:16.667
Pasteur also devised--well,
Koch didn't think this was so

00:18:16.667 --> 00:18:19.490
elegant,
but it certainly convinced

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:24.423
Pasteur and his followers--
a famous swan neck flask

00:18:24.423 --> 00:18:25.920
experiment.
 

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.720
That is, he sterilized a flask
with a swan's neck,

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.660
and found that if the culture
is boiled,

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.720
and the flask prevents air from
gaining access to it,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:43.098
then there was no development
inside of organisms that we

00:18:43.098 --> 00:18:44.818
would call bacteria.
 

00:18:44.818 --> 00:18:49.472
A culture of them could grow in
the flask, only if germs were

00:18:49.472 --> 00:18:51.180
allowed to enter it.
 

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:57.288
But if the neck of the flask is
broken and air is emitted--you

00:18:57.288 --> 00:19:03.496
can see the neck broken at the
bottom--then you get a luxurious

00:19:03.496 --> 00:19:05.900
development of life.
 

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:11.044
And this had enormous
implications for diseases and

00:19:11.044 --> 00:19:11.970
wounds.
 

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.633
Pasteur wrote simply,
"There is no known

00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:20.378
circumstance in which it can be
confirmed that microscopic

00:19:20.378 --> 00:19:24.210
beings came into the world
without germs,

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.598
without parents similar to
themselves."

00:19:28.598 --> 00:19:33.405
Now, Pasteur's success was
partly based on the fact that he

00:19:33.405 --> 00:19:38.378
was aware of the full range of
the scientific implications of

00:19:38.378 --> 00:19:41.362
his work,
and he selected carefully

00:19:41.362 --> 00:19:45.981
topics with high profile,
philosophical and biological

00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:46.930
interest.
 

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.750
He was an expert at cultivating
the media.

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:56.413
That was one reason that
spontaneous generation had led

00:19:56.413 --> 00:19:58.930
to so much excitement.
 

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:04.448
But most decisive in Pasteur's
work was what he did in the

00:20:04.448 --> 00:20:07.452
1870s,
as he turned to diseases,

00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:11.721
demonstrating the full
implications of his ideas on

00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:15.048
fermentation in the previous
decade.

00:20:15.048 --> 00:20:19.170
This new phase of discovery
occurred,

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.897
despite the fact that in 1868
he suffered a major cerebral

00:20:23.897 --> 00:20:27.086
hemorrhage,
that left him paralyzed on his

00:20:27.086 --> 00:20:27.828
left side.
 

00:20:27.828 --> 00:20:32.200
What did Pasteur do in the
1870s that was so crucial?

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:36.619
Well, first of all,
I'll look at two major things

00:20:36.619 --> 00:20:37.910
that he did.
 

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:42.762
One is work with silkworms,
and the other is work with

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:45.509
chicken cholera and anthrax.
 

00:20:45.509 --> 00:20:49.987
The first thing was a major
contribution to the germ theory

00:20:49.987 --> 00:20:54.156
of disease, accomplished by the
work with an unexpected

00:20:54.156 --> 00:20:58.410
experimental animal;
that is, the silkworm.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:03.180
And again let's look at the
fact that Pasteur's success,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.823
his influence and his genius,
was in part the fact that he

00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:11.568
took on really high-profile
research topics;

00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:14.935
that is to say,
disease of silkworms,

00:21:14.935 --> 00:21:19.705
where these diseases were
decimating one of France's

00:21:19.705 --> 00:21:23.259
leading industries,
that is, silk.

00:21:23.259 --> 00:21:26.911
Through meticulous and
painstaking research,

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:32.176
Pasteur demonstrated that there
were two major diseases at work

00:21:32.176 --> 00:21:34.980
affecting France's silkworms.
 

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:40.172
He called them pebrine and
flacherie--you needn't remember

00:21:40.172 --> 00:21:45.454
them for our purposes--and
asserted that both were specific

00:21:45.454 --> 00:21:48.368
diseases caused by bacteria.
 

00:21:48.368 --> 00:21:51.880
And he immediately realized
that there were enormous

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:54.357
implications,
not only for silkworms,

00:21:54.357 --> 00:21:56.630
but for human beings as well.
 

00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:01.009
He isolated then two germs
affecting silkworms,

00:22:01.009 --> 00:22:06.244
and demonstrated that they were
responsible for specific

00:22:06.244 --> 00:22:08.528
contagious diseases.
 

00:22:08.528 --> 00:22:13.355
Pasteur isolated a germ and
convincingly linked it with a

00:22:13.355 --> 00:22:17.416
specific disease,
and the concept of specificity

00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:22.092
was at the basis then of the
whole idea of the germ theory of

00:22:22.092 --> 00:22:22.950
disease.
 

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.769
Now you know Pasteur didn't
invent the idea of contagion.

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:30.250
You've seen it with Fracastoro.
 

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.088
You've seen it in John Snow,
who talked about the

00:22:34.088 --> 00:22:36.410
possibility of animalcules.
 

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.675
And there were other
scientists--Casimir Devaine in

00:22:39.675 --> 00:22:42.107
France,
the English physician John

00:22:42.107 --> 00:22:45.146
Sanderson--
who were also advancing a

00:22:45.146 --> 00:22:49.759
hypothesis that they were
finding microbes with their

00:22:49.759 --> 00:22:53.381
microscopes,
and hypothesizing that they

00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:55.990
might be the agents of disease.
 

00:22:55.990 --> 00:23:00.592
But Pasteur was the first to
provide a demonstration in a

00:23:00.592 --> 00:23:04.568
specific case,
proving that microbes were the

00:23:04.568 --> 00:23:08.009
causative agents of specific
diseases,

00:23:08.009 --> 00:23:13.108
and he provided a methodology
for further experimentation and

00:23:13.108 --> 00:23:14.130
discovery.
 

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:18.515
Pasteur then turned from
silkworms to diseases,

00:23:18.515 --> 00:23:22.900
the diseases of chicken cholera
and anthrax.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.479
Neither is responsible for
extensive human disease,

00:23:27.479 --> 00:23:31.509
as both are causes of diseases
of animals.

00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:35.210
But what was critical was the
process.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:39.141
His work on anthrax helped to
establish a model for

00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:42.048
investigating infectious
diseases,

00:23:42.048 --> 00:23:46.338
and establishing the claims for
the germ theory of disease,

00:23:46.338 --> 00:23:50.430
and putting that on solid
foundation.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.901
At the same time,
he made another major

00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.180
development.
 

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.201
His vision went beyond simply
demonstrating the germ theory,

00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:02.160
although he did that.
 

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.721
In addition,
he developed a public health

00:24:05.721 --> 00:24:08.467
practice--
that is, vaccination,

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:12.460
which had been pioneered a
hundred years before--

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:16.857
and he helped now to found the
discipline of experimental

00:24:16.857 --> 00:24:17.880
immunology.
 

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.128
Now, let's--we've seen
vaccination and the work of

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:22.190
Edward Jenner.
 

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.190
Let's define.
 

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:29.032
Vaccination is the introduction
into the body of either the

00:24:29.032 --> 00:24:32.827
whole,
or part, of a disease-causing

00:24:32.827 --> 00:24:36.837
microorganism,
in order to teach the immune

00:24:36.837 --> 00:24:40.118
system to attack that same
organism,

00:24:40.118 --> 00:24:45.548
should it reappear in the body
through natural processes.

00:24:45.548 --> 00:24:50.310
The mechanism is that the
vaccine primes the immune system

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.848
to produce antibodies,
or teaches immune cells to

00:24:54.848 --> 00:24:58.240
recognize and attack the
organism,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.880
that we now know perhaps to be
a virus,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.084
a bacterium,
or a parasite of a different

00:25:05.084 --> 00:25:05.818
kind.
 

00:25:05.818 --> 00:25:09.859
The problem,
of course, was how to stimulate

00:25:09.859 --> 00:25:13.150
immunity without causing
disease.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:19.317
Jenner benefited from the
cross-over immunity from cowpox

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:20.859
to smallpox.
 

00:25:20.859 --> 00:25:23.368
Pasteur did something else.
 

00:25:23.368 --> 00:25:27.180
He used the concept of
attenuation.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.858
Jenner is the father of
immunology, in a sense,

00:25:30.858 --> 00:25:34.779
Pasteur the founder of
experimental immunology.

00:25:34.779 --> 00:25:40.369
The idea he had was that live
pathogens could be introduced in

00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:43.824
the body,
but only after being treated in

00:25:43.824 --> 00:25:46.339
some way--
heat, for example,

00:25:46.339 --> 00:25:51.568
or passage through a different
host first was another--

00:25:51.568 --> 00:25:56.230
in such a way then that their
virulence is diminished.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.818
Then they'll stimulate the
immune response,

00:25:59.818 --> 00:26:04.690
without causing disease at all,
or only a mild disease.

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:09.115
This discovery was made during
his work with the bacterium that

00:26:09.115 --> 00:26:11.826
causes chicken cholera,
made sort of by

00:26:11.826 --> 00:26:14.538
chance--serendipity played a
role.

00:26:14.538 --> 00:26:19.249
He left a batch of bacteria
untouched for a week or so while

00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:23.318
he went on vacation during the
hot summer months.

00:26:23.318 --> 00:26:26.029
On returning,
he found initially,

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:29.840
to his frustration,
that the culture no longer

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.328
produced the disease when he
attempted to infect other

00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:35.598
chickens.
 

00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:40.226
So, he got a fresh batch of
bacterium, and injected the same

00:26:40.226 --> 00:26:43.362
chickens with it,
as well as a lot of new

00:26:43.362 --> 00:26:46.970
chickens, and made a surprising
discovery.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:51.038
That the original chickens,
injected with the old vaccine,

00:26:51.038 --> 00:26:55.430
remained healthy--in our terms,
they were immune--

00:26:55.430 --> 00:27:00.068
while the new and previously
untreated chickens sickened and

00:27:00.068 --> 00:27:00.618
died.
 

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:03.910
He repeated the experiment
several times,

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:08.616
with the same results,
and concluded that the summer

00:27:08.616 --> 00:27:14.338
heat had changed or attenuated
the culture of the bacterium.

00:27:14.338 --> 00:27:18.820
Later techniques expanded the
repertoire, demonstrating that

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:23.301
heat could kill vaccines of
chicken cholera but still induce

00:27:23.301 --> 00:27:24.288
immunity.
 

00:27:24.288 --> 00:27:28.946
There were other vaccines that
could employ live but attenuated

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.599
bacteria or viruses.
 

00:27:30.599 --> 00:27:33.369
Some used killed microorganisms.
 

00:27:33.369 --> 00:27:36.019
Some used sub-unit vaccines.
 

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:39.798
And the processes of
attenuation are not only heat,

00:27:39.798 --> 00:27:43.680
but let's say for polio,
could be the passage through

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.019
formaldehyde and various--
there are other means.

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:51.633
Attenuation though was critical
to the development of vaccine as

00:27:51.633 --> 00:27:53.609
a public health strategy.
 

00:27:53.609 --> 00:27:56.150
But let's return to Pasteur.
 

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.784
Having discovered attenuation
with chicken cholera,

00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:03.417
Pasteur applied the same
principle to the different

00:28:03.417 --> 00:28:05.088
disease of anthrax.
 

00:28:05.088 --> 00:28:09.574
The pathogen responsible was
the Bacillus anthracis

00:28:09.574 --> 00:28:13.430
that had recently been isolated
by Robert Koch.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.034
And if you see the film,
The Story of Louis

00:28:17.034 --> 00:28:22.240
Pasteur, you'll see what he
did in 1881 with the bacterium.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.807
In a famous experiment,
he vaccinated twenty-four sheep

00:28:26.807 --> 00:28:30.785
with an attenuated--
that is, heated--bacterium,

00:28:30.785 --> 00:28:35.487
after which he challenged the
original twenty-four sheep with

00:28:35.487 --> 00:28:38.700
live unattenuated anthrax
injections,

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.971
as well as twenty-four control
sheep that had not been

00:28:42.971 --> 00:28:44.019
vaccinated.
 

00:28:44.019 --> 00:28:47.049
The vaccinated sheep remained
healthy.

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:50.480
The non-vaccinated all died.
 

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:55.161
Then came the 1880s,
and Pasteur turned to another

00:28:55.161 --> 00:28:59.269
high profile disease,
and that is rabies.

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:04.057
Having discovered attenuation
by heat, with chicken cholera

00:29:04.057 --> 00:29:09.009
and anthrax, Pasteur extended
the principle of attenuation by

00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:10.328
other means.
 

00:29:10.328 --> 00:29:14.278
This involved further famous
experiments.

00:29:14.278 --> 00:29:17.849
Rabies, as it turns out,
was not another bacterial

00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:22.660
disease, but a disease caused by
what we now know to be a virus.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.885
In this case,
he attenuated the virus by

00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:30.354
isolating it from foxes,
and then passing it through an

00:29:30.354 --> 00:29:33.829
unnatural host of a different
species;

00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:36.750
in this case, the rabbit.
 

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.348
So, passing the virus through a
series of rabbit bodies,

00:29:40.348 --> 00:29:43.959
he succeeded in producing a
variant that would no longer

00:29:43.959 --> 00:29:49.280
cause the infection in foxes,
but would serve to protect

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.990
against the natural occurring
rabies.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:57.890
Rabies was not a high impact
disease,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.950
in terms of numbers of people
it affected,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.078
but it was a disease of high
drama,

00:30:03.078 --> 00:30:06.299
and one that was then,
and still is,

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:08.910
universally fatal.
 

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:12.490
So, it was ideal for attracting
media attention.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:16.098
The great human trial occurred
in July 1885,

00:30:16.098 --> 00:30:18.630
with a famous case of a
nine-year-old boy,

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.785
Joseph Meister,
who had been severely bitten by

00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:28.205
a rabid dog and was thought to
be certain to die an agonizing

00:30:28.205 --> 00:30:29.108
death.
 

00:30:29.108 --> 00:30:34.102
But taking advantage of the
incubation period for rabies,

00:30:34.102 --> 00:30:39.630
Pasteur vaccinated the boy with
his attenuated rabies virus.

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.026
Joseph Meister survived,
and became a celebrity patient,

00:30:44.026 --> 00:30:48.422
the first person ever known to
have survived after being

00:30:48.422 --> 00:30:51.460
severely bitten by a rabid
animal.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:54.958
And Meister remained loyal for
the rest of his life,

00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:55.848
to Pasteur.
 

00:30:55.848 --> 00:30:57.644
He returned,
as an adult,

00:30:57.644 --> 00:31:01.157
to Paris, to work as a
gatekeeper at the Pasteur

00:31:01.157 --> 00:31:05.720
Institute, where Pasteur himself
was buried in the crypt.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.348
The apocryphal story--I won't
assert its truth--

00:31:10.348 --> 00:31:12.940
the story is that he was killed
in 1940,

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:16.183
as an elderly man,
when he tried to prevent

00:31:16.183 --> 00:31:20.818
occupying German troops from
desecrating Pasteur's grave,

00:31:20.818 --> 00:31:26.868
the grave of a national icon of
an enemy power.

00:31:26.868 --> 00:31:31.694
A slightly less poignant but
better documented narrative is

00:31:31.694 --> 00:31:35.771
that he committed suicide in
despair of the German

00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:37.019
occupation.
 

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:41.824
Well, the Pasteur
Institute--that's the

00:31:41.824 --> 00:31:45.868
vaccination of Joseph Meister.
 

00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:49.404
It's not Pasteur doing the
actual vaccination,

00:31:49.404 --> 00:31:52.858
because, as I said,
he wasn't a physician.

00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:55.788
And this is the Pasteur
Institute,

00:31:55.788 --> 00:31:59.751
founded in 1887,
with Louis Pasteur himself as

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.657
its first director,
committed to biomedical

00:32:03.657 --> 00:32:07.404
research in Paris,
and to a series of satellite

00:32:07.404 --> 00:32:09.950
institutes elsewhere in the
world.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:15.666
It followed the public health
strategy of vaccination,

00:32:15.666 --> 00:32:20.305
pioneered by Jenner,
and now consolidated by

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:21.598
Pasteur.
 

00:32:21.598 --> 00:32:25.051
The founding of this
institute--you'll note its size

00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:28.865
and imposing nature--
gives us the opportunity to

00:32:28.865 --> 00:32:33.631
note in passing another aspect
of nineteenth and twentieth

00:32:33.631 --> 00:32:35.220
century science.
 

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.913
The way in which it became a
focal point for competing

00:32:38.913 --> 00:32:41.771
nationalisms,
in a way familiar to us from

00:32:41.771 --> 00:32:44.910
the Cold War competition between
the U.S.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.848
and the USSR.
 

00:32:46.848 --> 00:32:49.748
In any case,
there's a clear case in the

00:32:49.748 --> 00:32:53.909
nineteenth century with the
rivalry between Louis Pasteur

00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:57.688
and Robert Koch,
the embodiments and icons of

00:32:57.688 --> 00:33:00.539
French and German medical
science,

00:33:00.539 --> 00:33:04.420
of two hostile national powers.
 

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.509
The Pasteur Institute in Paris
rivaled the Koch Institute in

00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:11.440
Berlin.
 

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.625
And that brings us--we'll also
note the crypt where Pasteur is

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:17.390
buried.
 

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:24.797
There's a kind of--what shall I
say?--worship of Pasteur almost,

00:33:24.797 --> 00:33:28.558
and of French medical science.
 

00:33:28.558 --> 00:33:34.329
But let's move on to Robert
Koch, who lived from 1843 to

00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:37.538
1910,
the second great figure in the

00:33:37.538 --> 00:33:41.170
establishment of the germ theory
of disease,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:45.805
the German scientist who was
twenty years younger than

00:33:45.805 --> 00:33:46.680
Pasteur.
 

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:52.493
Now, if Pasteur's hallmark was
the imaginative breadth of his

00:33:52.493 --> 00:33:57.518
scientific vision,
Koch's distinctive feature was

00:33:57.518 --> 00:34:03.054
his scientific rigor,
his more rigorous techniques of

00:34:03.054 --> 00:34:04.519
microbiology.
 

00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:08.322
He had a critique,
a famous critique,

00:34:08.322 --> 00:34:12.760
of the whole swan neck flask
experiment.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:19.085
He argued that Pasteur had been
lucky--contamination was

00:34:19.085 --> 00:34:20.349
possible.
 

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:24.543
He developed the plate
technique, using the Petri dish

00:34:24.543 --> 00:34:27.945
and solid culture,
and he developed staining

00:34:27.945 --> 00:34:30.320
techniques for microscopy.
 

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:35.114
What I'd particularly like you
to note is his methodology,

00:34:35.114 --> 00:34:39.152
which he embodied in what are
called "Koch's

00:34:39.152 --> 00:34:40.920
Postulates."
 

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:45.641
This was the methodology for
determining that a suspected

00:34:45.641 --> 00:34:50.449
microbe is the causative agent
of a particular disease.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:53.750
He said you could know this
under four conditions.

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:58.806
First, the organism suspected
as a pathogen must be found in

00:34:58.806 --> 00:35:02.320
all animals suffering from the
disease.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.030
In other words,
it has to be universally

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:07.739
present where the disease is
present.

00:35:07.739 --> 00:35:13.527
And then the organism must be
isolated from a diseased animal,

00:35:13.527 --> 00:35:15.710
and grown in culture.
 

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:20.563
Third, the cultured organism
must cause the disease,

00:35:20.563 --> 00:35:24.369
when introduced into a healthy
animal.

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:29.293
And lastly, the organism must
be re-isolated from the

00:35:29.293 --> 00:35:32.420
experimentally infected animal.
 

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:38.266
These postulates are some of
the most famous in medical

00:35:38.266 --> 00:35:44.978
science, and were the model for
establishing germs as pathogens

00:35:44.978 --> 00:35:47.469
for other diseases.
 

00:35:47.469 --> 00:35:53.460
Koch's microscopy had a number
of immediate implications.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:57.708
His staining raised the idea
that if you could stain,

00:35:57.708 --> 00:36:01.302
you could also have an idea of
magic bullets,

00:36:01.302 --> 00:36:04.079
what later became antibiotics.
 

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:09.530
But Koch didn't pursue that
particular interest.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:15.125
The other was this led to
reliable differential diagnosis,

00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:19.739
and therefore a more properly
based nosology.

00:36:19.739 --> 00:36:23.563
It could lead also to major
public health measures,

00:36:23.563 --> 00:36:27.309
and ultimately to developments
in therapeutics.

00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:30.889
It furthered the sanitary idea,
and gave it a firm,

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:36.378
scientific basis,
and irrefutably proved the

00:36:36.378 --> 00:36:43.268
truth of contagionism rather
than anticontagionism,

00:36:43.268 --> 00:36:47.179
as Pettenkofer learned,
to his cost.

00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:50.210
But immediately there
wasn't--it didn't imply,

00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:53.998
and I think we should note
this--the understanding of

00:36:53.998 --> 00:36:58.300
disease did not immediately lead
to therapeutic advances.

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.096
Remember what happened in
Naples during the cholera of

00:37:03.096 --> 00:37:03.730
1884.
 

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:09.829
Koch's idea was used for a very
negative therapeutic method;

00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:15.210
that is, acid enemas that were
administered to patients.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.340
Well Koch also moved forward on
other diseases,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.889
applying the methods he had
developed,

00:37:22.889 --> 00:37:26.170
that Pasteur had developed in
the 1870s,

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:30.550
and applying his own rigorous
postulates.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:38.597
In 1882, the most famous of
all, he isolated the bacterium

00:37:38.597 --> 00:37:46.224
that causes tuberculosis,
the most prevalent disease of

00:37:46.224 --> 00:37:48.059
the time.
 

00:37:48.059 --> 00:37:52.414
The paper that Koch presented
in 1882 was one of the most

00:37:52.414 --> 00:37:57.079
dramatic and important moments
in the history of medicine.

00:37:57.079 --> 00:38:01.119
Tuberculosis was not feared in
the same way cholera was,

00:38:01.119 --> 00:38:04.025
but it was unquestionably the
greatest killer of the

00:38:04.025 --> 00:38:06.751
nineteenth century,
and until 1882,

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.500
it was shrouded in mystery.
 

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:15.762
Suddenly Koch cast a new shaft
of life, revealing to the world

00:38:15.762 --> 00:38:21.820
that he had unraveled the entire
mystery of its etiology.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.958
Then, in 1883,
he followed up this discovery

00:38:24.958 --> 00:38:28.679
with another that was almost
equally influential.

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:33.960
In 1883, he isolated the
Vibrio cholerae.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.983
Koch then had discovered and
demonstrated the role of

00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:42.733
pathogens,
the ones responsible for two of

00:38:42.733 --> 00:38:47.480
the most prevalent and feared
nineteenth century diseases.

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:51.425
This marked,
as I said, the definitive

00:38:51.425 --> 00:38:54.199
triumph of contagionism.
 

00:38:54.199 --> 00:38:59.063
And the 1880s and '90s were a
golden age of microbiology,

00:38:59.063 --> 00:39:03.838
with the pathogens being
discovered for a whole range of

00:39:03.838 --> 00:39:05.489
other diseases.
 

00:39:05.489 --> 00:39:09.630
This was an extraordinary
period in medical science.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:13.347
The pathogens were discovered
for gonorrhea,

00:39:13.347 --> 00:39:16.286
bubonic plague,
dysentery, tetanus,

00:39:16.286 --> 00:39:21.474
the common bacteria of wound
infections, staph infections and

00:39:21.474 --> 00:39:22.599
others.
 

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:26.503
The paradox,
of course, there were still few

00:39:26.503 --> 00:39:30.769
benefits for patients,
until the turn of the new

00:39:30.769 --> 00:39:31.860
century.
 

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:35.344
The quip was made that the main
beneficiaries,

00:39:35.344 --> 00:39:40.146
at first, of the germ theory of
disease, were physicians rather

00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:41.539
than patients.
 

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:44.898
But there was a major
exception, and that was not in

00:39:44.898 --> 00:39:46.610
medicine but in surgery.
 

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:51.079
And this introduces the third
major figure of our trio,

00:39:51.079 --> 00:39:53.579
establishing the germ theory of
disease,

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:59.159
and that's Joseph Lister,
who lived from 1827 to 1912,

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:02.630
and made his major
contributions in Scotland.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.240
He was professor of surgery at
Edinburgh University,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.206
where he was appalled by the
numbers of patients who died

00:40:10.206 --> 00:40:13.179
after otherwise successful
operations.

00:40:13.179 --> 00:40:17.407
You know the old joke about the
operation being successful,

00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:19.739
just too bad the patient died.
 

00:40:19.739 --> 00:40:24.751
Well, Pasteur's idea
immediately struck him for its

00:40:24.751 --> 00:40:28.460
lifesaving, practical
implications.

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.532
That is, he made practical use
of Pasteur's discovery about the

00:40:33.532 --> 00:40:37.788
role of airborne germs in
causing wound infections in

00:40:37.788 --> 00:40:38.768
surgery.
 

00:40:38.768 --> 00:40:41.106
Now, surgery,
before Lister,

00:40:41.106 --> 00:40:43.789
had a number of major limits.
 

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:48.489
There was pain itself,
and the need for speed.

00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:53.250
There was blood loss,
and there was septicemia.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:57.481
The result was that the major
body cavities remained off

00:40:57.481 --> 00:41:01.250
limits: the abdominal cavity,
the thoracic cavity,

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.018
the cranial cavity.
 

00:41:03.018 --> 00:41:07.119
And there was a high rate of
death from infection.

00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:11.711
The idea was thought by
physicians at the time that the

00:41:11.711 --> 00:41:15.880
infection arose through
spontaneous generation.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.681
As tissue died,
they gave off toxins that

00:41:19.681 --> 00:41:23.865
caused infection,
and so infection was simply

00:41:23.865 --> 00:41:29.000
accepted as an inevitable,
normal part of surgery.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.364
Lister's surgical revolution
occurred with the work he

00:41:32.364 --> 00:41:35.114
published,
"On the Antiseptic

00:41:35.114 --> 00:41:38.628
Principle in the Practice of
Surgery,"

00:41:38.628 --> 00:41:39.550
in 1864.
 

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.704
The implications of Pasteur's
work on fermentation were

00:41:43.704 --> 00:41:46.320
that--you could have an analogy.
 

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:49.260
If Pasteur was right,
there was no spontaneous

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:50.110
generation.
 

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:54.985
An airborne microorganism
penetrated the wound and caused

00:41:54.985 --> 00:41:57.250
infection or septicemia.
 

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:01.932
The remedy was to prevent the
penetration of the

00:42:01.932 --> 00:42:05.920
microorganism,
the idea of antisepsis.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:11.126
So, Lister accepted Pasteur's
insight that infections were not

00:42:11.126 --> 00:42:15.222
a chemical reaction,
caused by oxidation when air

00:42:15.222 --> 00:42:16.929
touched a wound.
 

00:42:16.929 --> 00:42:20.532
Instead, infection was the
result of contamination,

00:42:20.532 --> 00:42:24.210
from the outside,
of the wound by microorganisms.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:29.768
His solution first was this,
the carbolic spray device that

00:42:29.768 --> 00:42:31.110
he invented.
 

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.715
What you did was to spray the
air around the patient,

00:42:35.715 --> 00:42:40.320
applying carbolic acid also
directly to the wound.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.974
And Lister also washed his
hands before operating,

00:42:44.974 --> 00:42:48.110
and sterilized his instruments.
 

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:54.916
There's a stylized idea of a
Lister-type surgical technique

00:42:54.916 --> 00:42:56.090
at work.
 

00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:59.197
Well, until Lister's
revolutionary innovation,

00:42:59.197 --> 00:43:03.132
surgery had been an emergency,
a treatment of last resort,

00:43:03.132 --> 00:43:05.550
because of the wound infection.
 

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:10.809
After 1866, it became a normal
procedure.

00:43:10.809 --> 00:43:14.268
There were other innovations as
well, that went with it.

00:43:14.268 --> 00:43:16.840
His contemporaries improved on
Lister.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.822
You'll see that here they
aren't wearing masks,

00:43:19.822 --> 00:43:21.380
for example,
or gowns.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:25.119
Those are introduced--and
gloves made from vulcanized

00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:27.896
rubber--
were introduced in the 1890s,

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:31.867
but really became a part of
best practice only from about

00:43:31.867 --> 00:43:34.349
the time of the First World War.
 

00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:37.920
This also revolutionalized
obstetrics,

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.300
with the conquest of puerperal
fever,

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:46.125
with--hospital and clinical
procedures then were transformed

00:43:46.125 --> 00:43:48.170
by the antiseptic idea.
 

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:53.012
So, by the 1890s,
you have the consolidation of

00:43:53.012 --> 00:43:58.797
the germ theory of disease,
revolutionalizing medicine and

00:43:58.797 --> 00:44:03.262
become accepted throughout the
international medical

00:44:03.262 --> 00:44:04.489
profession.
 

00:44:04.489 --> 00:44:10.320
I'd like to mention the impact
also on culture.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.449
And this particular book,
which is by Bram Stoker,

00:44:16.449 --> 00:44:21.929
which is Dracula,
published in 1897,

00:44:21.929 --> 00:44:25.226
that gives us,
I would argue,

00:44:25.226 --> 00:44:29.820
expression in a really dramatic
and--

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:32.079
I just read it again--a really
scary--

00:44:32.079 --> 00:44:41.030
I assure you--idea of anxieties
about infection.

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:46.298
Now, Dracula is really,
for its time,

00:44:46.298 --> 00:44:48.750
a high-tech novel.
 

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:52.853
In it you see all about the
latest scientific and medical

00:44:52.853 --> 00:44:54.539
inventions and ideas.
 

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:58.360
It contains the phonograph,
the telephone,

00:44:58.360 --> 00:45:01.900
stenography,
railroads, the two-wheeled

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.018
bicycle.
 

00:45:03.018 --> 00:45:07.161
And in medicine it deals with
the latest inventions in

00:45:07.161 --> 00:45:10.523
psychiatry, in blood
transfusion, infectious

00:45:10.523 --> 00:45:11.539
diseases.
 

00:45:11.539 --> 00:45:15.543
And indeed, I would argue,
it also involves what was the

00:45:15.543 --> 00:45:19.619
cutting edge scientific idea in
medicine at the time,

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:24.626
the possibility of vector borne
diseases like malaria and

00:45:24.626 --> 00:45:25.610
filarial.
 

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:30.780
Then it's just at the time when
we're going to see tropical

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.965
medicine--
we'll look at next

00:45:32.965 --> 00:45:36.690
time--becomes the cutting edge
of late nineteenth-century,

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:39.619
early twentieth-century medical
science.

00:45:39.619 --> 00:45:42.050
Now, you know the drill about
Dracula,

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:45.326
how Count Dracula--the word
Dracula comes from the

00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:48.967
Romanian word dracul,
which means a devil,

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:50.429
a little devil.
 

00:45:50.429 --> 00:45:55.429
And you know how he lived,
the Count--the evil Count--in

00:45:55.429 --> 00:45:59.246
Transylvania,
in Romania, in the Carpathian

00:45:59.246 --> 00:46:00.518
Mountains.
 

00:46:00.518 --> 00:46:05.913
And the important point is he
travels by ship from the Black

00:46:05.913 --> 00:46:09.094
Sea port,
aboard a Russian vehicle,

00:46:09.094 --> 00:46:14.740
through the Mediterranean,
and up along the coast of Spain

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:18.231
and France,
where he lands by ship in

00:46:18.231 --> 00:46:20.840
Britain at the port of Whitby.
 

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:26.295
Then he travels by train,
and is transported by railroad

00:46:26.295 --> 00:46:31.552
from Whitby to London,
where his plan is to ravage the

00:46:31.552 --> 00:46:34.530
huge population of London.
 

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.320
Now, what does that remind you
of?

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:40.061
Doesn't that--it reminds
me--I'm going to argue that

00:46:40.061 --> 00:46:42.409
Dracula is many things.
 

00:46:42.409 --> 00:46:46.963
In literature,
you'll see that Dracula

00:46:46.963 --> 00:46:53.382
is a metaphor--and this is often
said--for repressed sexuality,

00:46:53.382 --> 00:46:55.969
in the Victorian Era.
 

00:46:55.969 --> 00:47:01.826
You'll find interpretations of
it as expressing also a

00:47:01.826 --> 00:47:04.699
repressed homoeroticism.
 

00:47:04.699 --> 00:47:09.159
In it, we also find expression
of the battle of good and evil.

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:13.449
That's our friend Dracula.
 

00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:17.931
And you'll see--love never
dies--the idea of--the sexual

00:47:17.931 --> 00:47:21.840
idea is clearly--some 200 films
have been made of

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:23.389
Dracula.
 

00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:28.860
And you can see clearly
possible sexual ideas in films

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.409
such as this.
 

00:47:30.409 --> 00:47:32.739
And they're clearly also here.
 

00:47:32.739 --> 00:47:36.590
But what I want to argue is
what's been neglected so often--

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:40.188
and I think it's really
important--is I want to argue

00:47:40.188 --> 00:47:44.619
that Dracula is also an
allegory of infectious disease;

00:47:44.619 --> 00:47:48.534
not a specific disease,
but diseases like plague and

00:47:48.534 --> 00:47:51.177
cholera,
that originated in Eastern

00:47:51.177 --> 00:47:54.797
Europe and traveled,
just as Dracula did,

00:47:54.797 --> 00:47:59.682
by ship and by railroad;
that they had Count Dracula's

00:47:59.682 --> 00:48:04.208
goal of ravaging industrial
cities, huge population centers

00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:05.380
like London.
 

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:10.480
And it's interesting that the
vampire hunters in the novel are

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:14.744
doctors, physicians,
whose mission is to destroy the

00:48:14.744 --> 00:48:16.500
invading vampire.
 

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.030
Also involved,
we see, is the seasonality.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.643
It's not by chance that Count
Dracula arrives in late

00:48:23.643 --> 00:48:26.701
August/September,
just as cholera would have,

00:48:26.701 --> 00:48:28.230
or bubonic plague.
 

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:32.516
And we see miasmatism in the
novel: the flowers,

00:48:32.516 --> 00:48:36.530
the garlic, the mists
surrounding Dracula.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:40.177
And I would argue that Dracula
is a composite of many

00:48:40.177 --> 00:48:41.090
infections.
 

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:43.690
Here's the handsome count again.
 

00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:47.980
And I'd like to show you one
more handsome picture of him;

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:49.670
and that's that one.
 

00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:54.849
And I would argue that this
clearly makes me think also of

00:48:54.849 --> 00:48:59.713
vector-borne disease,
and possibly this is a million

00:48:59.713 --> 00:49:03.469
miles removed from malaria and

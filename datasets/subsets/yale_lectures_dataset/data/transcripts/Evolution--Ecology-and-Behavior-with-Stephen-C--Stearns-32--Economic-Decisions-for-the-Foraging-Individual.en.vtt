00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.360
Prof: Okay,
let's get going.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.870
We're into the last segment of
the course.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.799
We did evolution,
and then we did ecology,

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:11.540
and now we're going to do
behavior.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.320
I think the sequence does make
sense,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.963
because evolution helps to
explain how the things we deal

00:00:18.963 --> 00:00:22.839
with in ecology evolved,
and it also explains how much

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:25.470
of what we see in behavior
evolved.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.468
But I want to say at the outset
that the behavioral ecology view

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:35.070
of behavior--which is basically
expressed on this slide;

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.700
so behaviors evolved--the
evolved patterns that we see in

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.525
behavior should reflect things
that happen frequently to the

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.836
organisms in their environment,
and the way animals behave

00:00:46.836 --> 00:00:51.016
should reflect the consequences
of behavior for lifetime

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:52.840
reproductive success.
 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.910
That is really only part of the
biology of behavior.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.506
If you really want to
understand it at all levels,

00:01:00.506 --> 00:01:03.591
you have to understand how
behavior evolved

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:06.433
phylogentically;
so you need a comparative view

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:07.030
of behavior.
 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.628
You need to understand this
issue, which is how is it that

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:13.799
behavior is adaptive;
is it, or is it a maladaptation?

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.753
But then you also need to
understand how behavior

00:01:17.753 --> 00:01:21.061
develops;
that is, if we follow the

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:26.251
organism from zygote to
death--you'll see some patterns

00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:30.959
of that today--how is it that
organisms learn?

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.180
How is behavior acquired?
 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.360
That's a whole field in and of
itself.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.310
And then finally we need to
understand the mechanistic

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.870
underpinnings of behavior.
 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.617
So in that respect there are a
lot of different ways you can go

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:45.360
at it.
 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.269
You can go at it through
neurophysiology;

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:49.209
you can go at it through
endocrinology.

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.030
There are many different kinds
of mechanisms that are involved

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.160
in triggering behavior patterns.
 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.965
So what we're going to
concentrate on in this course is

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:02.560
primarily the behavioral ecology
approach to it,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.665
which is well exemplified in
the book that you've got by

00:02:05.665 --> 00:02:06.739
Krebs and Davies.
 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.378
But these other issues are also
very interesting biology,

00:02:10.378 --> 00:02:14.718
and I'm just indicating that if
you get interested in behavior,

00:02:14.718 --> 00:02:16.740
there are lots of ways you can
go at it,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.018
and there are entirely
different paradigms you can use

00:02:21.018 --> 00:02:22.310
to analyze it.
 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.802
So the five themes that we'll
approach--and these are the next

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:28.378
five lectures;
so this is a sketch of how the

00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:29.318
course finishes.
 

00:02:29.318 --> 00:02:32.330
Today we'll talk about foraging
and hunting.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.818
Then next time we'll talk about
evolutionary game theory,

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:39.119
which is one of the major
analytical frameworks within

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.300
which people approach behavior.
 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.274
We'll have a look at mating
systems and parental care,

00:02:44.274 --> 00:02:46.800
and they are connected in
interesting ways.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.090
We'll take a look at
alternative breeding strategies,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.288
which are frequency dependent
breeding strategies,

00:02:53.288 --> 00:02:57.250
often best analyzed with
evolutionary game theory.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.647
And then we'll close with the
evolutionary and ecological

00:03:03.647 --> 00:03:09.246
analysis of selfishness,
altruism and cooperation,

00:03:09.246 --> 00:03:12.560
in animals and in humans.
 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.780
So those are the five themes
that I have selected out of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.650
behavioral ecology to emphasize
in this course.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.520
It's an introductory course
and, you know,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.952
frankly it would be great to
give you an entire semester just

00:03:24.952 --> 00:03:27.056
on behavior,
because it's such an

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:28.240
interesting topic.
 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.695
But I will signal that we do
have other courses in the

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:32.781
department on it,
and if you get interested in

00:03:32.781 --> 00:03:34.449
them, they might be fun to take.
 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.650
Okay?
 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.212
So I'm going to start with
foraging by bringing back in

00:03:41.212 --> 00:03:44.379
something that you guys
presented on that Friday,

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.020
which is the marginal value
theorem.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.150
And this time I'm going to
apply it not to whether you

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.092
should fill your plate up,
your tray up,

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:56.775
in the dining hall full,
if you're going to the far end,

00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:59.280
or just with a little bit if
you're going to be close to the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.992
counter,
but to the issue of how long

00:04:00.992 --> 00:04:03.633
you should guard your mate,
and indicate that,

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:08.590
in fact, the same intellectual
framework applies in both cases.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.406
Then I'll give you an example
where we can actually do a

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:16.291
clever experiment to get the
foraging organism to tell us

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:18.860
what fitness measure it is
using;

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.290
and that's often a very
satisfying kind of experiment to

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.031
do, if you can get the animal,
which cannot talk,

00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:33.180
to tell you what it thinks it's
doing.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.750
Then I'll illustrate how two
different birds deal with risk.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.266
Because a small bird,
at the end of a cold winter

00:04:43.266 --> 00:04:47.663
day, is exposed to extreme risk
of dying overnight--and I can

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:50.009
tell you this is quite real.
 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.269
Over the course of a normal
Connecticut winter,

00:04:52.269 --> 00:04:55.060
I am often picking up the
occasional house sparrow,

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.807
or robin, or whatever,
which has died next to my house

00:04:57.807 --> 00:05:01.990
because we've had a cold night;
so that risk is real.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.012
Then I'll discuss a little bit
how predators shape crypsis and

00:05:06.012 --> 00:05:07.199
conspicuousness.
 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.651
But then the sort of--the thing
that you'll probably remember a

00:05:10.651 --> 00:05:14.213
week from now is the part of the
lecture that deals with why hunt

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:15.050
in a group?
 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.709
And at that point I'll show
some chimpanzees hunting.

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:20.985
And I want to warn you that is
not something where you want to

00:05:20.985 --> 00:05:23.992
be bringing- eating the food
that you've brought into the

00:05:23.992 --> 00:05:26.555
room,
or anticipating lunch,

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.329
okay, because this is pretty
gory stuff.

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:34.440
Okay, marginal value theorem.
 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.516
The important thing about the
marginal value theorem first is

00:05:38.516 --> 00:05:41.440
that it's dealing with foraging
in space.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.019
And it's assuming you're
starting in one point,

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:46.379
which would normally be your
home, your nest,

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.024
your refuge,
your den, and you are going out

00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:52.100
to another point where you are
looking for food.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.540
And you have options.
 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.971
You could either go to this
place or you might go to some

00:05:55.971 --> 00:05:57.839
other place, when you go out to
get food.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.278
So you have to travel to get to
that patch of food,

00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.680
and then you have to search in
the patch,

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.949
and then once you start getting
food in the patch,

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.588
you accumulate it--and this is
a cumulative curve--

00:06:09.588 --> 00:06:13.639
in a way that expresses
diminishing marginal returns.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.642
So the harder- the longer
you're in the patch,

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:17.958
the harder you have to look,
basically because you've

00:06:17.958 --> 00:06:20.139
already eaten some of the stuff
in the patch.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.230
Okay?
 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.182
So there are a number of things
to remember about this kind of

00:06:25.182 --> 00:06:25.829
diagram.
 

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:28.160
One is the X axis is time.
 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.180
Two is it's split up into
travel time and search time,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.771
and at the point that you start
searching is where you draw your

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:39.348
payoff curve here,
because that's the point at

00:06:39.348 --> 00:06:42.259
which you're going to draw this
cumulative payoff curve.

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.291
The vertical axis is some kind
of payoff, and it's assumed to

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:48.509
have a relationship to fitness.
 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.180
Okay?
 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.910
So it's going to be food,
or it could be mates.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:59.088
And probably the clever thing,
the most clever thing about

00:06:59.088 --> 00:07:05.375
this--and I well remember when
Rick Charnov first drew this

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:07.494
thing;
he and I were grad students

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:09.677
together, and he was in his
office and he was drawing this

00:07:09.677 --> 00:07:10.790
thing on a piece of paper.
 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.629
So I saw it before it was
published.

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.603
The clever thing is the nice
geometrical solution to the

00:07:15.603 --> 00:07:16.740
optimality problem.
 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:22.374
And the way to think of that is
this: here is the measurement of

00:07:22.374 --> 00:07:24.673
time,
and the question is at what

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:28.019
point should you stop searching
in this patch and go on to

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:28.899
another one?
 

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:35.735
And if you imagine all the
possible lines that you could

00:07:35.735 --> 00:07:38.865
draw,
that fan out from this axis,

00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:43.672
it turns out that the one which
is tangent to that curve has the

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:44.970
highest slope.
 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.810
Okay?
 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.661
So the slope--I mean,
you can see that,

00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:49.610
just geometrically from looking
at it.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.678
Okay, this is the line which is
going to have the highest slope

00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:55.452
of all of the possible lines
that you could draw that are

00:07:55.452 --> 00:07:56.690
within this envelope.
 

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.379
And you can't go above this
line.

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:02.629
The reason you can't go above
this line basically is that

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:05.300
you're not getting any food
above that line.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.369
This line is defining the rate
at which you can conceivably

00:08:09.369 --> 00:08:12.035
accumulate food,
just by the ecological

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:14.139
constraints of that patch.
 

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.899
And so this is the maximal
point for the slope.

00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:21.879
And then you ask yourself,
what is the slope?

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:27.170
Well the slope is ∆y/∆x.
 

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.250
Right?
 

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.049
∆y is the change that you
get, or the amount of payoff you

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:34.950
get per amount of time you spend
searching;

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:37.200
so it's the payoff per unit
time.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.827
So drawing a line that way,
as a tangent,

00:08:39.827 --> 00:08:42.259
maximizes the payoff per unit
time.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:43.830
You don't have to write down
any equation;

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.720
it's just geometry.
 

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.120
Okay?
 

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.650
And that actually is the cool
thing about the marginal value

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.418
theorem.
 

00:08:52.418 --> 00:08:58.868
Now I want you to imagine you
are walking through a field in

00:08:58.868 --> 00:09:01.393
the Alps,
and there are some cows grazing

00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:03.784
in the field,
and you look off to the side

00:09:03.784 --> 00:09:06.879
and you see two biologists down
on the ground,

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.982
looking at a cow-pie,
and you wonder what the hell is

00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:12.139
going on;
why do they have their noses

00:09:12.139 --> 00:09:13.639
down in a pile of cow dung?
 

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:17.590
And the answer is they are
looking at this guy.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.129
Okay?
 

00:09:19.129 --> 00:09:22.873
And one of the biologists is
Geoff Parker and the other one

00:09:22.873 --> 00:09:24.692
is me;
because I had this happen to me

00:09:24.692 --> 00:09:25.700
with Geoff in the Alps.
 

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:26.899
Okay?
 

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:31.721
So a cow--let me go back--a cow
has come along and it has

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:35.984
dropped a pile of dung here,
and it has been rapidly

00:09:35.984 --> 00:09:38.548
colonized by a bunch of dung
flies,

00:09:38.548 --> 00:09:41.750
and because of that,
within about a minute,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.668
a male will find a female and
they'll go into copulation.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:49.115
And then the issue is how long
should the male stay on that

00:09:49.115 --> 00:09:52.558
female before he jumps off and
goes to find another one?

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:57.529
You can measure how many of the
offspring of that female will

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:00.178
get fertilized if he stays on.
 

00:10:00.178 --> 00:10:04.000
And this is the proportion of
eggs that he will fertilize,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.139
if he stays on.
 

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:06.070
Okay?
 

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.476
So it's starting to look pretty
much like a marginal value

00:10:10.476 --> 00:10:11.870
theorem problem.
 

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:20.057
You can set up the analysis as
search and guard time,

00:10:20.057 --> 00:10:22.350
plus time spent in copula.
 

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.067
So this is his- how long it
takes him to search and guard a

00:10:27.067 --> 00:10:31.543
female, and this is how long he
spends in copula on her,

00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:33.740
and this is his payoff.
 

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.899
And now look at what the Y axis
is.

00:10:36.899 --> 00:10:41.668
It's directly fitness;
that's a direct fitness payoff.

00:10:41.668 --> 00:10:45.123
So actually this is the purest
form of the biological

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.980
implementation of marginal value
theorem;

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.970
finding a mate and fertilizing
some eggs.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.245
Now the interesting thing is
that he jumps off about ten

00:10:55.245 --> 00:10:57.808
minutes earlier than predicted.
 

00:10:57.808 --> 00:11:03.567
Any ideas on why he might jump
off ten minutes earlier than

00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:04.759
predicted?
 

00:11:10.678 --> 00:11:17.009
It's actually a method of risk
minimizing or spreading of risk.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:22.061
He cannot predict when the next
fresh cow-pie is going to hit

00:11:22.061 --> 00:11:25.357
the ground,
and that's going to be the next

00:11:25.357 --> 00:11:28.639
open resource which gets
colonized by females,

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:31.823
and he needs some time to find
it, because he wants to be the

00:11:31.823 --> 00:11:32.779
first one there.
 

00:11:32.779 --> 00:11:35.312
If he can be the first one
there, he'll get the best

00:11:35.312 --> 00:11:35.759
female.
 

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:39.403
So he has to jump off this
female a little bit earlier than

00:11:39.403 --> 00:11:41.788
this simple analysis would
predict,

00:11:41.788 --> 00:11:47.241
just to hedge against the
problem of trying to be first to

00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:49.058
the next cow-pie.
 

00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:52.509
This problem is actually almost
quantifiable.

00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:56.178
Of course you are measuring
some rather strange things.

00:11:56.178 --> 00:11:58.960
You're sitting there with your
stopwatch watching as the

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.234
cow-pies arrive on the surface
of the pasture,

00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:01.740
right?
 

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:05.009
But it's a completely
analyzable problem.

00:12:05.009 --> 00:12:08.761
Now, so that's the marginal
value theorem applied to mate

00:12:08.761 --> 00:12:09.500
guarding.
 

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.298
Now let's look at an experiment
that you can do with honeybees.

00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:18.756
And this was designed by Paul
Schmid-Hempel,

00:12:18.756 --> 00:12:22.798
who is a very clever Swiss
biologist.

00:12:22.798 --> 00:12:27.634
And what Paul did was he built
a model in which he could

00:12:27.634 --> 00:12:32.908
predict how long bees would
spend flying between flowers,

00:12:32.908 --> 00:12:35.985
and how many flowers they would
visit before they came back to

00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:36.539
the hive.
 

00:12:36.539 --> 00:12:39.178
Okay?
 

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:43.803
And he had two different
measures that they might be

00:12:43.803 --> 00:12:44.529
using.
 

00:12:44.529 --> 00:12:47.385
So this is the optimal
relationship between how long it

00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:50.294
is flying between flowers and
how many flowers you visit

00:12:50.294 --> 00:12:52.200
before you fly back to the hive.
 

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.339
In one model he had calories
per minute, which is the usual

00:12:57.339 --> 00:12:57.960
rate.
 

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.649
Okay?
 

00:12:58.649 --> 00:13:01.220
In the marginal value theorem,
when you maximize that slope,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:04.351
if you're measuring that payoff
curve in calories what you're

00:13:04.351 --> 00:13:06.909
measuring then is maximal
calories per minute,

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:09.058
in the marginal value theorem.
 

00:13:09.058 --> 00:13:11.548
Paul thought well maybe they
have another fitness measure.

00:13:11.548 --> 00:13:14.528
They might be using calories
gained per calories spent.

00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:16.360
So he built the two models,
and he had quite different

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.841
predictions,
and then he manipulated them by

00:13:18.841 --> 00:13:22.636
gluing a little wire onto their
back and adding a tiny little

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:23.269
weight.
 

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:26.116
So he made them--you know,
he had a series of treatments

00:13:26.116 --> 00:13:29.221
where they weren't weighted and
then they had a little weight

00:13:29.221 --> 00:13:31.190
and then they had a lot of
weight.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:32.230
And this is what they did.
 

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.070
This is the data, okay?
 

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.191
So it really looks like he was
able to get them to tell him

00:13:38.191 --> 00:13:42.808
which fitness measure they were
using while they were foraging.

00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.500
That's a very,
very clever experiment.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.690
And this is the kind of thing
that you can do in behavioral

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:49.240
ecology.
 

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.635
It's possible to construct
situations in which the

00:13:52.635 --> 00:13:56.309
decisions that the animals are
making are so precisely

00:13:56.309 --> 00:14:00.470
constrained that you can get
them to give you an answer.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:04.438
I am waving over all the
details in the mathematical

00:14:04.438 --> 00:14:05.139
models.
 

00:14:05.139 --> 00:14:06.289
Okay?
 

00:14:06.289 --> 00:14:09.350
That's graduate student stuff.
 

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.653
But I think the essential point
is that you can do an experiment

00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:17.821
that will get you to tell you
what an animal is actually using

00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:19.528
as a fitness measure.
 

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:24.764
Okay, now two comments on the
problem of how to deal with

00:14:24.764 --> 00:14:28.035
risk;
and this is the small bird in

00:14:28.035 --> 00:14:29.480
winter problem.
 

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.570
And this was a nice experiment.
 

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:35.448
This is a Great Tit,
which is a European form of

00:14:35.448 --> 00:14:39.990
chickadee, and this is an
experiment which is done in an

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:43.870
aviary, and this is a variable
environment.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.750
Okay?
 

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.744
So when the experiment starts,
the food supply starts becoming

00:14:49.744 --> 00:14:53.791
unpredictable in time;
and that's just a manipulation

00:14:53.791 --> 00:14:57.190
that the experimenter is
imposing on the animal.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.535
And as the food starts getting
unpredictable,

00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:04.500
the bird starts getting fat.
 

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.960
That tells you a couple of
interesting things right there.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.881
It says normally the bird
doesn't like to be that fat,

00:15:09.881 --> 00:15:12.859
but it's going to get fat
because it sees that its food

00:15:12.859 --> 00:15:15.120
supply is getting very
unpredictable.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.797
And then the way that you build
one control into this experiment

00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:21.947
is then to switch it at this
point into a constant food

00:15:21.947 --> 00:15:24.924
supply so that the environment
just becomes nice and

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.259
predictable and the bird
relaxes,

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.048
shrugs its shoulders and says,
"Oh,

00:15:29.048 --> 00:15:34.015
I can get away with getting
back to a normal weight,"

00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:36.019
and drops its weight.
 

00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:38.279
So that's one way of dealing
with it.

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:41.937
But there's another way of
dealing with it,

00:15:41.937 --> 00:15:47.422
and that is that if you look at
this other relative of the Great

00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:53.070
Tit--okay, this is a Marsh Tit;
it also looks a bit like a Coal

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.586
Tit;
it's a little bit smaller,

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:58.717
has a black head--
and you put it in a high

00:15:58.717 --> 00:16:02.250
variance environment or a low
variance environment,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.500
this one, it doesn't change its
weight at all.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.840
It just packs on as much weight
as it can, by evening.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.332
And by the way,
at that latitude it's getting

00:16:12.332 --> 00:16:14.940
dark at 4:00 in the afternoon in
the winter.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.370
So it's going up to just about
peak weight.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.980
And you can see how much it's
losing by the next morning.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.452
What it does though is it
stores seeds,

00:16:25.452 --> 00:16:28.575
and if you put it in a high
variance environment,

00:16:28.575 --> 00:16:32.480
it greatly increases the number
of seeds that it stores.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.875
So one of these
species--they're very closely

00:16:34.875 --> 00:16:37.243
related by the way;
it's interesting that there

00:16:37.243 --> 00:16:39.779
doesn't seem to be much
phylogenetic component to this;

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:43.057
one of them decided to pack it
on as body mass that it carries

00:16:43.057 --> 00:16:45.690
around with itself,
and the other one decided that

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:47.408
it was going to store seeds.
 

00:16:47.408 --> 00:16:49.690
It may have something to do
with the risks of predation.

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:52.469
Big, fat birds don't get away
from predators quite as easily

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:53.929
as nice slender little birds.
 

00:16:57.808 --> 00:17:02.326
Now what are some of the
consequences of predatory

00:17:02.326 --> 00:17:04.538
behavior for the prey?
 

00:17:04.538 --> 00:17:09.528
Well one of them is so-called
aposematic coloration;

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:14.075
and that is that if you're
carrying around something that

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:18.539
is going to poison your
predator, you want your predator

00:17:18.539 --> 00:17:19.920
to know that.
 

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.663
You don't want--you know,
if you put a bunch of ham

00:17:23.663 --> 00:17:26.509
sandwiches out in Saybrook
Commons,

00:17:26.509 --> 00:17:29.420
and you've got cyanide in five
of them,

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:32.395
and it's in the interest of
those five cyanide-laced ham

00:17:32.395 --> 00:17:36.063
sandwiches not to be eaten,
then you want a big warning

00:17:36.063 --> 00:17:38.720
label on it that says,
"Do not eat."

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.460
Right?
 

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.670
Well that's what these are,
these warning colorations.

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:47.555
If you go out and you pick up a
warningly colored millipede,

00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:52.108
and you shake it in your hand,
it will smell like bitter

00:17:52.108 --> 00:17:53.019
almond.
 

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:55.170
And it's perfectly safe,
by the way.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.750
There's not enough cyanide in
it to get hurt by sniffing it.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.275
So you're perfectly safe
picking up and shaking a

00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:02.518
millipede,
except you may feel a little

00:18:02.518 --> 00:18:05.913
moral compromise at the act of
shaking an invertebrate nervous

00:18:05.913 --> 00:18:06.470
system.
 

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.460
Okay?
 

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:09.580
But they will emit cyanide all
over your hand,

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.420
and it does smell like bitter
almond.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:15.740
And of course the monarch
butterfly caterpillar,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:20.059
which gets its cardiac
glycosides from milkweed,

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:24.838
will cause tachycardia in the
birds that eat it.

00:18:24.838 --> 00:18:29.104
Tachycardia is a condition
where your heart jumps say from

00:18:29.104 --> 00:18:32.181
a pulse rate of 80,
in a human--let's say if you've

00:18:32.181 --> 00:18:35.044
been exercising a little bit you
might have your pulse at 80 or

00:18:35.044 --> 00:18:37.882
100 or something like that;
with tachycardia you go up to

00:18:37.882 --> 00:18:40.536
250 or 300 and you pass out,
because your heart starts

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.538
fluttering and it can't pump
anymore.

00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:46.089
So that's what eating that will
do to a Blue Jay;

00:18:46.089 --> 00:18:49.200
it will have cardiac arrest.
 

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.769
So it would take a few of them
to do that to you.

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:54.626
So I suggest that if you want
to try this one,

00:18:54.626 --> 00:18:55.700
don't eat more than one.
 

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.940
Okay?
 

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.060
If you really want to get into
it, you're probably getting

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.960
threatened if you eat maybe five
or six of them,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.819
or make a milkshake out of them
or something like that.

00:19:06.538 --> 00:19:09.358
One can do experiments with
this kind of thing as well.

00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:14.517
This is a situation in which
chicks, just regular domestic

00:19:14.517 --> 00:19:18.589
chicks, were given different
colored baits.

00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:19.400
Okay?
 

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.481
And in both of these situations
they were given seeds that had

00:19:23.481 --> 00:19:27.096
been stained green or blue,
and they had been soaked in

00:19:27.096 --> 00:19:29.585
quinine;
and chicks do not like seeds

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.269
that are soaked in quinine.
 

00:19:31.269 --> 00:19:34.058
So they were both distasteful.
 

00:19:34.058 --> 00:19:37.567
The only difference here is
that in one case the green and

00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:41.076
blue seeds are on a green
background, and here they are on

00:19:41.076 --> 00:19:42.430
a blue background.
 

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:46.140
And what you can see is that
the ones that match the

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.759
background continue to get
eaten,

00:19:48.759 --> 00:19:51.449
and the ones that stand out
from the background start

00:19:51.449 --> 00:19:52.380
getting avoided.
 

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.450
Okay?
 

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.201
So there's a bit of learning;
oh, I don't like to taste these

00:19:56.201 --> 00:19:56.640
things.
 

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.798
But then they avoid the ones
that they see most easily.

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:01.798
And that's what's going on over
here.

00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:03.950
It's this process that has
produced these colors.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.490
Of course it can go in the
other direction.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:13.400
If you, in fact,
are not distasteful,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:17.667
and you want to avoid being
eaten, then often natural

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:22.182
selection will change your
morphology in such a way that

00:20:22.182 --> 00:20:25.960
it's rather difficult to see
what you are.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.150
Okay?
 

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.161
The head is here;
that's the end of the right

00:20:30.161 --> 00:20:32.490
wing, that's the end of the left
wing;

00:20:32.490 --> 00:20:35.250
there's a nice wing vein
running down the middle.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:39.721
Some of these things are just
remarkably precise in resembling

00:20:39.721 --> 00:20:41.920
a dead leaf or other things.
 

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.693
I think some of the ones that I
like the most are the praying

00:20:44.693 --> 00:20:46.588
mantises that look like flower
petals,

00:20:46.588 --> 00:20:49.393
and sit on flowers,
and grab things when they come

00:20:49.393 --> 00:20:53.480
in;
they're very nasty.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.970
Here's another one that's very
nasty;

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.230
same kind of thing, okay.
 

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.740
So this is aggressive mimicry.
 

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:03.163
These are the light signals
which are given out by different

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:09.596
species of so-called fireflies--
in fact, these are beetles--and

00:21:09.596 --> 00:21:15.555
they have a light organ,
and you can see that there's a

00:21:15.555 --> 00:21:19.058
species specific signal pattern.
 

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:21.875
Now normally you would think,
okay fine, they're just

00:21:21.875 --> 00:21:23.500
dividing up the frequencies.
 

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.602
They don't need to have an FCC
to regulate which frequency they

00:21:27.602 --> 00:21:28.000
use.
 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.769
They're flying through the
night.

00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:31.930
They see a signal over there
and they can say,

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.838
"Oh, that is another one
of my species,

00:21:33.838 --> 00:21:38.190
I'll go check it out and
potentially mate with it."

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.115
So you might think,
oh, that's all just normal mate

00:21:42.115 --> 00:21:42.980
behavior.
 

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:47.532
However, these are males that
are flickering,

00:21:47.532 --> 00:21:52.190
and then they get a response
from a female.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.868
Okay?
 

00:21:52.868 --> 00:21:55.874
So this would be male-male,
female, male-male,

00:21:55.874 --> 00:21:57.410
female kind of thing.
 

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:01.204
And so there are some that
mimic the light signals of

00:22:01.204 --> 00:22:03.890
another species;
some females that are sitting

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.450
there saying--they're faking it.
 

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:06.338
Okay?
 

00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:08.636
A male blinks,
the female can see,

00:22:08.636 --> 00:22:12.673
oh, that's not a male of my
species, therefore I can safely

00:22:12.673 --> 00:22:13.509
eat him.
 

00:22:13.509 --> 00:22:15.925
So she goes blink,
with the signal of the other

00:22:15.925 --> 00:22:18.289
species, he flies in,
and she chews him up.

00:22:18.289 --> 00:22:21.519
In so doing she gets two things.
 

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:27.181
She gets calories out of him,
but in some cases she also is

00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:32.646
absorbing a defensive chemical
that will protect her from

00:22:32.646 --> 00:22:35.380
birds, bats and spiders.
 

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:37.400
So she gets a double dose.
 

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:41.318
She gets both calories and she
gets defense from doing this.

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:45.036
This kind of aggressive mimicry
is reasonably widespread,

00:22:45.036 --> 00:22:48.818
and it has been evolved
convergently a number of times.

00:22:48.818 --> 00:22:52.298
The one that always got me as a
kid is the saber-tooth blenny.

00:22:52.298 --> 00:22:55.660
You know about cleaning wrasses
that come into the mouths of big

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:58.700
fish and clean the parasites off
of them and so forth,

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:02.361
and the big fish have evolved,
because this is a beneficial

00:23:02.361 --> 00:23:03.980
thing,
to kind of relax.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.539
And so you will see giant
groupers and barracudas opening

00:23:06.539 --> 00:23:09.238
their mouths and letting these
little fish swim through them

00:23:09.238 --> 00:23:10.608
and clean off their teeth.
 

00:23:10.608 --> 00:23:14.194
Well, there is another fish
called the saber-tooth blenny

00:23:14.194 --> 00:23:17.909
that mimics both the color and
the approach behavior of the

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:20.396
cleaning wrasse;
which is, by the way,

00:23:20.396 --> 00:23:21.490
a sigmoidal dance.
 

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:22.670
It goes through the water like
this.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.261
And so you see one of these
things coming up and you kind of

00:23:25.261 --> 00:23:27.039
relax and say,
"Oh, it's just a cleaning

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.220
wrasse,
it's going to be fine."

00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:29.880
And it comes up,
and if it's a human,

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.509
it takes a chunk out of your
thigh,

00:23:31.509 --> 00:23:35.130
and if it's a fish that has its
mouth open,

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:37.529
it rips out a chunk of gill and
goes running off.

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:41.703
So this is the sort of thing
that led Darwin to think that

00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:46.096
evolution just fills the world
up with things that are taking

00:23:46.096 --> 00:23:49.318
advantage of every possible
opportunity;

00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:54.098
and aggressive mimicry is a
good example of this.

00:23:54.098 --> 00:24:01.758
One of the interesting issues
with predation and parasitism

00:24:01.758 --> 00:24:07.038
and mimicry has to do with the
cuckoo.

00:24:07.038 --> 00:24:10.103
And I want to mention it
because it really is an

00:24:10.103 --> 00:24:12.190
interesting series of puzzles.
 

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.299
Okay?
 

00:24:13.299 --> 00:24:14.759
So here's a cuckoo.
 

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:17.445
Cuckoos, by the way,
feed on caterpillar larvae,

00:24:17.445 --> 00:24:20.532
and so they tend to disappear
from places where lots of

00:24:20.532 --> 00:24:22.019
insecticides are used.
 

00:24:22.019 --> 00:24:24.048
So they're kind of a canary in
a coalmine.

00:24:24.048 --> 00:24:27.233
If there have been cuckoos on
the landscape and you can't hear

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:29.392
them anymore,
it means that intensive

00:24:29.392 --> 00:24:32.497
agricultural practice has
probably wiped out the entire

00:24:32.497 --> 00:24:35.880
large fauna of caterpillars;
so they like to eat

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.058
caterpillars.
 

00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:40.398
And what they do is they go
around and they find a nest,

00:24:40.398 --> 00:24:43.799
like a robin's nest here,
and they lay their own egg into

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:44.588
the nest.
 

00:24:44.588 --> 00:24:48.458
And they have their whole
developmental program set up in

00:24:48.458 --> 00:24:52.808
such a way that their baby will
hatch earlier than the babies of

00:24:52.808 --> 00:24:54.259
the host species.
 

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:57.464
And its behavior is set up in
such a way that the first thing

00:24:57.464 --> 00:24:59.807
that it does is--
you know, it's just a tiny

00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:02.244
little baby bird,
and it's just hatched out,

00:25:02.244 --> 00:25:05.008
but it has enough muscular
coordination and enough

00:25:05.008 --> 00:25:08.277
behavioral complexity to take
the other eggs and shove them

00:25:08.277 --> 00:25:11.710
out of the nest onto the ground,
so it's the only one left.

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.788
And then it sits there.
 

00:25:13.788 --> 00:25:17.078
And it's got a very effective
feeding behavior.

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:19.163
It opens its mouth,
it gives all of the

00:25:19.163 --> 00:25:21.465
morphological and behavioral
cues that say,

00:25:21.465 --> 00:25:23.769
"Feed me,
feed me, feed me."

00:25:23.769 --> 00:25:26.856
And the parents work really
hard, the parents of the other

00:25:26.856 --> 00:25:29.618
species work really hard to come
in and feed it,

00:25:29.618 --> 00:25:31.368
and you get a baby cuckoo out
of the nest,

00:25:31.368 --> 00:25:33.430
instead of a warbler or
whatever.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:35.108
Okay?
 

00:25:35.108 --> 00:25:39.619
Well why don't the hosts throw
out the cuckoo egg?

00:25:39.619 --> 00:25:40.579
There they are.
 

00:25:40.579 --> 00:25:41.380
They're good parents.
 

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.220
They come back to the nest.
 

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.190
There's an egg in it that they
haven't laid.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.797
Sometimes it looks quite a bit
like their egg,

00:25:48.797 --> 00:25:51.380
sometimes it doesn't;
it all depends on which

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.534
particular host species it is
and how close that particular

00:25:54.534 --> 00:25:57.578
race of cuckoo is to matching
the host species color.

00:25:57.578 --> 00:26:00.862
Well there are really,
I think, two reasons,

00:26:00.862 --> 00:26:04.450
but they may not be
quantitatively sufficient to

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.740
explain everything we see.
 

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.660
One is the source-sink
distinction.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.075
The hosts can't adapt as fast
as the cuckoo because the

00:26:13.075 --> 00:26:16.742
parasitized nests are sinks for
the host, and unparasitized

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:19.019
nests are sources for the hosts.
 

00:26:19.019 --> 00:26:22.304
Most of the sources are coming
out of nests that have not had

00:26:22.304 --> 00:26:23.288
cuckoos in them.
 

00:26:23.288 --> 00:26:25.615
If a cuckoo has gotten into the
nest, it's wiped out that

00:26:25.615 --> 00:26:26.240
reproduction.
 

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.660
Okay?
 

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.700
So the adaptation is to the
source, which is to the

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.680
condition without cuckoos,
and not to the sink.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.743
But there's another issue,
and that is if you're just

00:26:37.743 --> 00:26:41.220
starting to evolve the behavior
of throwing eggs out of your

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.160
nest,
and you're not very good at it

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.176
yet,
you can make a serious mistake

00:26:45.176 --> 00:26:47.098
by killing one of your own kids.
 

00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:51.269
So there's kind of a threshold
there that you have to get over.

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:54.430
You have to actually--this is a
behavior where you actually have

00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:57.390
to be accurate and pretty good
at it, before it pays off.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:27:00.977
Before you get good at it,
you are indulging in some very

00:27:00.977 --> 00:27:02.130
costly behavior.
 

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:02.880
Okay?
 

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.568
So that's another reason.
 

00:27:04.568 --> 00:27:08.482
Another reason that we don't
see the hosts throwing the

00:27:08.482 --> 00:27:12.615
cuckoo egg out is that the
cuckoos may be moving on to new

00:27:12.615 --> 00:27:13.338
hosts.
 

00:27:13.338 --> 00:27:16.494
So it may be that the cuckoos
for say a hundred years

00:27:16.494 --> 00:27:18.770
parasitized robins,
and the robins may

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.019
slowly--slowly,
because of these reasons--

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:23.720
start to evolve a response to
cuckoos,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.381
at which point the cuckoos just
switch over and start

00:27:26.381 --> 00:27:27.608
parasitizing warblers.
 

00:27:27.608 --> 00:27:30.028
And they do that for awhile,
and they just keep moving

00:27:30.028 --> 00:27:32.630
around among the different
species in their landscape,

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.630
so that they're always able to
stay ahead,

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:41.239
because their evolution is a
little bit faster than that of

00:27:41.239 --> 00:27:42.400
the hosts.
 

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.038
So that process is hard to
observe.

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:48.098
And the egg mimicry isn't very
precise.

00:27:48.098 --> 00:27:51.730
You can see here,
this isn't a very good match.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.420
This is one kind of cuckoo egg.
 

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.068
There are some that are a bit
closer to robins.

00:27:55.068 --> 00:27:57.078
This might be appropriate for
another kind of species.

00:27:57.078 --> 00:28:01.605
The egg mimicry isn't very
precise, and it is still kind of

00:28:01.605 --> 00:28:06.130
puzzling why the hosts don't
throw out more cuckoo eggs.

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:08.269
It's an interesting problem.
 

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:13.269
Now I'd like to talk about
hunting in a group.

00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:19.328
And this is a situation that is
interesting,

00:28:19.328 --> 00:28:25.509
both because we can quantify
the benefits of foraging styles,

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:29.486
and we can see whether or not
animals are actually doing what

00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:31.740
is quantitatively best for them.
 

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:35.501
But it also addresses the whole
issue of why animals should

00:28:35.501 --> 00:28:36.670
exist in groups.
 

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.338
And since we are a group living
and hunting primate,

00:28:40.338 --> 00:28:44.440
this is a very interesting
thing for us to contemplate.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.448
Now when an individual joins a
group, it's making a pretty

00:28:49.448 --> 00:28:51.470
fundamental decision.
 

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.759
It's basically deciding that
the payoff it's going to get,

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:57.640
from the coordination of group
hunting,

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.791
is going to more than
compensate for the fact it's

00:29:00.791 --> 00:29:04.375
going to have to share the food;
unless it's an extremely

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:07.574
confident dominant type,
it's going to have to share the

00:29:07.574 --> 00:29:08.039
food.
 

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:09.348
Okay?
 

00:29:09.348 --> 00:29:13.118
So what you see in wolves,
coyotes,

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:16.517
African hunting dogs and hyenas
is that all of these things will

00:29:16.517 --> 00:29:19.806
hunt alone for little things and
they'll hunt together for big

00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:20.400
things.
 

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.342
So go up to Ellesmere Island in
the Arctic, pop yourself down

00:29:24.342 --> 00:29:27.560
onto a wolf study site,
and go out and look at the

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:28.808
wolves hunting.
 

00:29:28.808 --> 00:29:32.068
And if they are hunting for
voles and mice,

00:29:32.068 --> 00:29:34.859
which are about this big,
you'll see individual wolves

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:38.503
moving about the landscape,
trapping them with their paws

00:29:38.503 --> 00:29:40.068
and munching them up.
 

00:29:40.068 --> 00:29:43.690
However, if they decide to
tackle something like a muskox,

00:29:43.690 --> 00:29:47.109
they will form up into a pack
and go into coordinated

00:29:47.109 --> 00:29:49.348
behavior,
with a division of labor and

00:29:49.348 --> 00:29:52.490
assigned roles,
to bring down the muskox.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.195
And the muskox,
of course, have a

00:29:54.195 --> 00:29:56.748
counter-adaptation,
which is a group adaptation,

00:29:56.748 --> 00:29:58.519
and they form a protective
circle,

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.368
and they all face outward
towards the wolves,

00:30:00.368 --> 00:30:02.700
and they defend themselves with
their horns.

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.818
Similarly for coyotes,
African hunting dogs and

00:30:05.818 --> 00:30:06.430
hyenas.
 

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.876
With African hunting dogs,
they will be going after

00:30:08.876 --> 00:30:11.519
usually small rodents or birds
or things like that,

00:30:11.519 --> 00:30:14.585
on the ground,
but they're actually capable of

00:30:14.585 --> 00:30:16.220
bringing down a zebra.
 

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:17.940
This is a dog which is this big.
 

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:18.400
You know?
 

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.298
A zebra is a horse,
which is this big.

00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:26.459
And five or six African hunting
dogs, each of which weighs say

00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:30.688
about 75 pounds maybe,
at max--50 to 75 pounds--can

00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:33.480
bring down a 500 pound zebra.
 

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.182
So the interesting thing is
that they switch facultatively

00:30:38.182 --> 00:30:43.132
from solitary hunting to group
hunting, as group size- as the

00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:45.358
size of prey increases.
 

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:50.097
Now in chimpanzees--I'm going
to show you a bit of the gory

00:30:50.097 --> 00:30:53.038
detail of chimpanzees in a
minute.

00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:55.262
But before I do that I just
want to show you some of the

00:30:55.262 --> 00:30:56.759
kinds of things that these
capture.

00:30:56.759 --> 00:31:01.232
So we have wolves and coyotes
and hyenas and African hunting

00:31:01.232 --> 00:31:04.299
dogs,
and these are pictures where

00:31:04.299 --> 00:31:09.217
they have done a sophisticated,
coordinated group hunt to bring

00:31:09.217 --> 00:31:10.910
down a big piece of meat.
 

00:31:22.558 --> 00:31:24.380
Now let's see what chimpanzees
do.

00:31:31.880 --> 00:32:14.839
&lt;&lt;Professor Stearns plays
a video&gt;&gt;

00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:15.960
Prof: That's Brutus.
 

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.490
Brutus was born in 1952, August.
 

00:32:24.490 --> 00:36:02.730
&lt;&lt;Professor Stearns plays
the video&gt;&gt;

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:04.730
Prof: That's an
important point.

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.920
They use seasoning,
a little spice from the weeds.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:37:11.050
&lt;&lt;Professor Stearns plays
the video&gt;&gt;

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.005
Prof: So that's in
Christophe Boesch's study site,

00:37:15.005 --> 00:37:18.610
which is in Tai National Park
in the Ivory Coast.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:27.699
Those pictures were taken in
about 1990,1991.

00:37:27.699 --> 00:37:31.436
I had been there in February of
1989, and I had been out on a

00:37:31.436 --> 00:37:33.179
hunt with that same group.
 

00:37:33.179 --> 00:37:36.572
I had had lunch,
which was by the way fruit,

00:37:36.572 --> 00:37:37.518
with them.
 

00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:40.148
I ate the same stuff they did,
but I was eating fruit,

00:37:40.148 --> 00:37:41.239
not colobus monkeys.
 

00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:47.960
Those guys are all dead now,
the chimps.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.530
They died of Ebola and they
died of poaching.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:54.750
However, a smaller group has
replaced them.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:58.463
Of all of the chimps that were
in that group in 1990,

00:37:58.463 --> 00:38:01.750
there is only one female who is
still alive.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.599
But the group is back to about
oh fifteen or twenty;

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:07.320
at that point there were sixty
in it.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.130
So let's look at an analysis of
why they choose to hunt in a

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.920
group.
 

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.599
Okay?
 

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:18.766
So the increase must more than
balance the cost:

00:38:18.766 --> 00:38:19.440
sharing.
 

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.018
They do it during the rainy
season.

00:38:24.018 --> 00:38:26.210
During the dry season they
crack nuts.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.802
So these chimps actually have a
culture where they teach their

00:38:29.802 --> 00:38:33.159
offspring how to crack nuts with
a hammer and an anvil.

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:36.536
This is true west of a certain
river in the Ivory Coast and

00:38:36.536 --> 00:38:38.750
it's not true in the rest of
Africa.

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:43.318
And you can see that they hunt
a lot more frequently in

00:38:43.318 --> 00:38:45.349
September and October.
 

00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:48.929
And I was actually there and
saw the hunt in February;

00:38:48.929 --> 00:38:51.431
so they weren't so frequent in
February, I was lucky to see

00:38:51.431 --> 00:38:51.690
one.
 

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.969
But these chimps hunt a lot.
 

00:38:53.969 --> 00:38:57.880
And if you look at the hunting
success as a function of the

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.617
numbers in the hunting party--
you can see on the top here a

00:39:02.617 --> 00:39:07.864
comparison of solitary and group
hunts in the Ivory Coast in

00:39:07.864 --> 00:39:09.909
Gombe and at Mahale.
 

00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:14.380
So Gombe is Jane Goodall's
study site in Tanzania,

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:19.398
Tai is in the Ivory Coast,
and Mahaleis a Japanese study

00:39:19.398 --> 00:39:20.219
site.
 

00:39:20.219 --> 00:39:23.278
And you can see that they hunt
quite a bit in Tai,

00:39:23.278 --> 00:39:26.090
and they do a lot more group
hunting there.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.393
And if you look at the impact
of group size on capture

00:39:29.393 --> 00:39:31.047
success,
you can see that the more

00:39:31.047 --> 00:39:32.559
chimps that are hunting in the
group,

00:39:32.559 --> 00:39:36.349
the more likely it is they are
to make a kill,

00:39:36.349 --> 00:39:41.407
the longer the hunt lasts,
and the greater the degree of

00:39:41.407 --> 00:39:44.349
collaboration during the hunt.
 

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:48.840
So this is team behavior,
where individuals have roles,

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.340
and they learn to play a team
role,

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:54.601
and they learn to do what is
good for the team so that the

00:39:54.601 --> 00:39:56.489
team will have greater success.
 

00:39:56.489 --> 00:40:01.250
If we look at success as a
function of group size,

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:02.630
you can see that the net--and
by the way,

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.880
this is now measured in net
benefit in calories,

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.097
and in order to calculate that,
you have to be able to estimate

00:40:11.097 --> 00:40:14.429
how many calories a chimpanzee
is putting out,

00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:16.952
if it's running along the
ground or climbing a tree or

00:40:16.952 --> 00:40:18.000
something like that.
 

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.371
And so this is taken from
exercise physiology,

00:40:20.371 --> 00:40:23.059
the estimates are taken from
exercise physiology.

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:26.471
And then you can figure out how
many calories are there in a

00:40:26.471 --> 00:40:28.380
colobus monkey of a given size.
 

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.965
And it turns out that the right
number to have--if you are a

00:40:32.965 --> 00:40:37.940
hunter you do better up until
you get to a group size of five;

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.943
after that you have to share
with too many others and the

00:40:40.943 --> 00:40:42.230
payoff isn't so great.
 

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:45.559
If you are a bystander,
it's pretty much the same,

00:40:45.559 --> 00:40:47.190
the curve mimics that.
 

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.789
And if you are a latecomer
who's coming in,

00:40:49.789 --> 00:40:53.320
then normally you don't get too
much of what is caught.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.603
So in this particular hunt,
Brutus led the hunt and he made

00:40:58.603 --> 00:40:59.880
the capture.
 

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:03.030
So that was the chimp that you
saw going up as the blocker;

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.329
that was Brutus.
 

00:41:04.329 --> 00:41:06.583
Brutus, by the way,
was the oldest male in the

00:41:06.583 --> 00:41:09.539
group, and he also had a couple
of strategic innovations.

00:41:09.539 --> 00:41:12.576
Brutus had figured out that in
competition with neighboring

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:14.327
groups--
and chimps do have wars with

00:41:14.327 --> 00:41:17.070
neighboring groups--
if you were in a state of being

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.710
the weaker group and you were
being confronted by a big one,

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.380
what you would do is you would
go over and you would display at

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:23.940
the border.
 

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.190
They would come in,
and then you would quiet down--

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.527
and he got them all to quiet
down--and the pack of males

00:41:28.527 --> 00:41:31.079
would run around the back and
steal a female from the back of

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:31.929
the other group.
 

00:41:31.929 --> 00:41:34.755
And this caused such chaos and
disarray that they would

00:41:34.755 --> 00:41:37.791
normally be able to overpower a
larger neighboring group by

00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:39.518
using this sneaking behavior.
 

00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:42.226
Just think of how much
strategic thinking it requires

00:41:42.226 --> 00:41:44.099
to figure something like that
out.

00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:46.309
And that was Brutus;
he was a smart guy.

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:47.780
And there he is right there.
 

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:53.280
So Macho was contending with
Brutus to be an alpha male--

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.275
there are two or three
different ways you can define

00:41:56.275 --> 00:41:59.987
group hierarchy in chimps--
and Macho was trying to be

00:41:59.987 --> 00:42:01.070
group leader.
 

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.539
And he was actually a very
collaborative hunter.

00:42:03.539 --> 00:42:06.751
It's one way to sort of weasel
your way into power is to

00:42:06.751 --> 00:42:07.920
collaborate a lot.
 

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.989
And Rousseau never made it.
 

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:13.255
And Rousseau actually got
attacked by a leopard once,

00:42:13.255 --> 00:42:16.708
who managed to rip off half of
his scrotum, and Rousseau

00:42:16.708 --> 00:42:22.130
survived that;
pretty amazing.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:25.728
So this is the function--it's
sort of a hill-shaped or

00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:29.056
hump-shaped function of success
versus group size,

00:42:29.056 --> 00:42:32.250
with the best group size being
around five.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:37.135
And then if you look at who
shares in the capture,

00:42:37.135 --> 00:42:42.518
what you see is a breakdown
where there is considerable

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:45.510
sharing which is going on.
 

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.708
And you can see that
bystanders, who are often

00:42:48.708 --> 00:42:51.759
females,
are eating meat often after a

00:42:51.759 --> 00:42:56.793
capture for nearly half an hour,
and the captor usually gets

00:42:56.793 --> 00:42:57.849
most of it.
 

00:42:57.849 --> 00:43:00.920
But it's very interesting how
much gets shared.

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.880
And if you look at the kind of
hunt that was involved,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.657
you can see interestingly,
if you classify the hunts by

00:43:08.657 --> 00:43:11.128
kind of a primitive,
not terribly well-coordinated

00:43:11.128 --> 00:43:13.121
hunt,
which is a half-anticipation,

00:43:13.121 --> 00:43:15.268
through a single-anticipation
hunt,

00:43:15.268 --> 00:43:18.278
where one of the chimps is
actually successfully

00:43:18.278 --> 00:43:21.992
anticipating where the colobus
are going and manages to get

00:43:21.992 --> 00:43:25.159
over and block them off,
to a doubled-anticipation hunt,

00:43:25.159 --> 00:43:26.639
which is even more
sophisticated,

00:43:26.639 --> 00:43:30.900
you can see that there is a
reward in terms of amount of

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.550
meat eaten for participating in
a more sophisticated hunt.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:36.719
Okay?
 

00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:43.378
They pay a tax,
and they are willing to pay a

00:43:43.378 --> 00:43:44.880
tax to belong to the group.
 

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.760
The tax that they pay is by
sharing what they capture.

00:43:50.768 --> 00:43:55.592
So there is an anticipation of
being willing to give up

00:43:55.592 --> 00:43:58.630
personal gain for group benefit.
 

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:03.056
And there's another thing going
on here, and that is that quite

00:44:03.056 --> 00:44:06.768
a bit of the reward of
bystanders is trading food for

00:44:06.768 --> 00:44:07.340
sex.
 

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:12.885
So both taxes and prostitution
appear to be present in

00:44:12.885 --> 00:44:14.349
chimpanzees.
 

00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:15.929
Now what about learning?
 

00:44:15.929 --> 00:44:19.550
Well this is the frequency of
ambushes that are used by

00:44:19.550 --> 00:44:21.429
hunters of different ages.
 

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:24.440
Ambushing is,
you know, a moderately

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.420
sophisticated tactic.
 

00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.001
It's not quite as sophisticated
as a big group hunt,

00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:31.733
but it's an indication that,
you know, young chimps are

00:44:31.733 --> 00:44:33.000
learning how to hunt.
 

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.809
And this is how old they are.
 

00:44:34.809 --> 00:44:38.106
And the interesting thing about
this is--well of course they're

00:44:38.106 --> 00:44:40.284
weaned at five;
so they aren't really going to

00:44:40.284 --> 00:44:42.918
start participating until they
get there, and they don't do too

00:44:42.918 --> 00:44:44.829
much hunting before they become
teenagers.

00:44:44.829 --> 00:44:47.204
But then let's suppose they
start playing here,

00:44:47.204 --> 00:44:49.268
they start going out and
hunting here.

00:44:49.268 --> 00:44:52.496
It takes them until they're
thirty-five-years-old before

00:44:52.496 --> 00:44:54.199
they really hit their peak.
 

00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:57.342
It takes them about twenty
years to learn how to be an

00:44:57.342 --> 00:44:58.469
effective hunter.
 

00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:00.289
That's pretty amazing.
 

00:45:03.389 --> 00:45:05.911
And if you look,
if you break this down by

00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:08.679
half-anticipations and
full-anticipations,

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:12.894
what you see is the frequency
with which full-anticipations

00:45:12.894 --> 00:45:17.692
are practiced in hunts is lower,
and it takes a long time before

00:45:17.692 --> 00:45:21.179
they get up to the level of
half-anticipations.

00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:24.552
So these are categories of
sophistication in hunting,

00:45:24.552 --> 00:45:27.989
and it takes a long time to get
more sophisticated.

00:45:27.989 --> 00:45:34.052
So to sum up on the behaviors
that are involved in foraging

00:45:34.052 --> 00:45:40.429
and hunting, I've really given
you today two paradigms for how

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:42.730
to think about it.
 

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.099
One of them is the marginal
value theorem,

00:45:45.099 --> 00:45:48.670
which tells you how you should
decide when to stop hunting in a

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.378
certain place,
or when to stop copulating in a

00:45:51.378 --> 00:45:53.847
certain place,
and go off to find either food

00:45:53.847 --> 00:45:56.710
or mates in another place;
and that works in a spatial

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.074
situation where you have to move
some distance before you get to

00:46:00.074 --> 00:46:00.768
the patch.
 

00:46:00.768 --> 00:46:04.367
And the other paradigm that
I've given you is simply the

00:46:04.367 --> 00:46:08.293
cost-benefit analysis of how
much caloric reward do I get out

00:46:08.293 --> 00:46:11.630
of hunting in a group versus
hunting by myself?

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:15.599
And you can see that if you do
that cost-benefit analysis,

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:20.969
it turns out that organisms
don't do it perfectly,

00:46:20.969 --> 00:46:24.960
but they do get better and
better at approximating the

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.239
optimal payoff.
 

00:46:26.239 --> 00:46:30.800
So that tells us that hunting
is basically microeconomics.

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.400
It's a very short-term,
kind of selfish behavior,

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.137
where the group hunting
behavior, which looks like it

00:46:37.137 --> 00:46:42.224
might not be so selfish,
in terms of caloric reward is

00:46:42.224 --> 00:46:45.659
quite selfish,
and it looks like it's

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:47.130
long-term selfish.
 

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:52.666
So the sharing is stabilizing
relationships that are paying

00:46:52.666 --> 00:46:58.679
off in terms of future hunts and
future sexual opportunities.

00:46:58.679 --> 00:47:02.224
We've seen that predation is
shaping both the behavior and

00:47:02.224 --> 00:47:03.780
the morphology of prey.
 

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.268
We saw that with both
conspicuous coloration,

00:47:06.268 --> 00:47:08.871
aposematic coloration,
which is advertising the

00:47:08.871 --> 00:47:12.291
presence of poisons;
and we saw it with crypsis,

00:47:12.291 --> 00:47:16.492
which is cryptic coloration,
which is hiding and looking

00:47:16.492 --> 00:47:18.250
like something else.
 

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.809
We saw that aggressive mimicry
illustrates an important

00:47:21.809 --> 00:47:25.431
evolutionary trend,
which is that every available

00:47:25.431 --> 00:47:29.996
opportunity will eventually be
seized by some species evolving

00:47:29.996 --> 00:47:31.420
into that niche.
 

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:34.994
And we saw it with fireflies,
and then I told you about

00:47:34.994 --> 00:47:37.840
cleaning wrasses in saber-tooth
blennies.

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.599
And then finally I showed you
the cooperative hunting,

00:47:41.599 --> 00:47:43.940
complex example in chimpanzees.
 

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:48.434
It requires strategic thinking;
it requires a kind of teamwork

00:47:48.434 --> 00:47:53.179
that really is only attained in
fairly complex organisms.

00:47:53.179 --> 00:47:55.635
I'll mention one other,
which is deeply cool,

00:47:55.635 --> 00:47:58.369
and that is the bubble-nets of
humpback whales.

00:47:58.369 --> 00:48:01.579
Who has heard of a humpback
whale bubble-net?

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:03.099
A few.
 

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:07.001
Humpback whales hunt in family
groups in Alaska and down near

00:48:07.001 --> 00:48:10.710
Antarctica, and they hunt for
fish that are in schools.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:11.889
They hunt herring.
 

00:48:11.889 --> 00:48:15.570
And a mama humpback will go
down below a group of herring,

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:19.889
and she'll start up in a
spiral, just at the right rate,

00:48:19.889 --> 00:48:22.913
so that the bubbles that she's
blowing out of her nose will all

00:48:22.913 --> 00:48:25.594
rise up in a curtain to the
surface around the school of

00:48:25.594 --> 00:48:28.463
herring at the same time;
so a curtain of bubbles,

00:48:28.463 --> 00:48:31.552
that looks like a net,
is going up around the school

00:48:31.552 --> 00:48:32.400
of herring.
 

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.150
And at the same time she gives
a few little signals with her

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:39.378
complex calling behavior,
and the whole family of whales

00:48:39.378 --> 00:48:41.414
will dive down,
and they'll come up as a group

00:48:41.414 --> 00:48:43.563
and they'll open their mouths
underneath the school of

00:48:43.563 --> 00:48:45.333
herring,
and all of the mouths will

00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:47.309
emerge from the water at the
same time.

00:48:47.309 --> 00:48:50.512
They can take out an entire
school of herring with one bite

00:48:50.512 --> 00:48:51.010
apiece.
 

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:55.351
They're taking in maybe two or
three tons of fish when they do

00:48:55.351 --> 00:48:56.840
this;
like five or six whales doing

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:58.242
it all at once,
they're right next to each

00:48:58.242 --> 00:48:58.550
other.
 

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:05.010
So there are very interesting
examples where other species,

00:49:05.010 --> 00:49:09.039
that appear to have complex
cognition and good signaling

00:49:09.039 --> 00:49:11.244
capacity,
learn really rather

00:49:11.244 --> 00:49:12.920
sophisticated behavior.
 

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.530
And I think the chimpanzee hunt
is one of the most interesting.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:19.789
I'm sorry it's so bloody,
and I do hope you enjoy your

00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:20.130
lunch.

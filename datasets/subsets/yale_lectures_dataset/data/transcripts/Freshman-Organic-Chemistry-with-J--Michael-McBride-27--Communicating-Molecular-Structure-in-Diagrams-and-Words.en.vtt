00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.075
Prof: We're talking
about facts, ideas and words,

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:07.190
in relation to stereochemistry.
 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.762
And the words have to be
generalized, in the way we

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.420
communicate things,
to include models;

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.450
things like this, right?
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:49.080
&lt;&lt;Technical
Adjustments&gt;&gt;

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.386
Okay, so models,
but also what you can draw on a

00:00:52.386 --> 00:00:56.466
piece of paper that will convey
stereochemical structure to

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.240
people.
 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.859
So the standard we use in
drawing is wedges,

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.542
to mean they're coming out at
you, in the direction that they

00:01:04.542 --> 00:01:06.444
expand,
and dashes mean they're going

00:01:06.444 --> 00:01:07.500
back into the board.
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.260
Although if all you draw is
dashes, it's not immediately

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.680
obvious which end is going back,
if it's a dash.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.968
Right?
 

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.417
But if one end has nothing on
it, it's clear,

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.310
that it's going back from the
carbon that's shown.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.001
So you have to use your
stereochemical intuition

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.720
sometimes to interpret that.
 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.067
Although if you draw a wedge,
it's clear which way it's

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:28.459
coming.
 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:31.661
And sometimes people draw
wedges with dots,

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.099
meaning they're going back in.
 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:38.355
But there are many ways that
people make mistakes in drawing

00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:38.860
this.
 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.050
So it needs a little practice.
 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.126
That one's okay,
and clearly corresponds to a

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:46.202
tetrahedron with 109°
degree bond angles,

00:01:46.202 --> 00:01:48.230
shown like this -- right?
 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.275
-- the blue one's coming out at
you, the black- the yellow ones

00:01:51.275 --> 00:01:53.290
going back, green and red,
up and down.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.750
Okay, so that drawing is fine.
 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.950
What's wrong with this drawing?
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.188
Sherwin?
 

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:09.924
Student:  It couldn't
mean like a

00:02:09.924 --> 00:02:11.169
&gt;.
 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.139
The upper bond and the lower
bond are --

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:16.210
Prof: I can't hear -- I
still can't hear.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.569
Student:  Oh,
the upper bond and the lower

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.620
bond are
&gt;.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.788
Prof: What are the bond
angles?

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:21.470
How about between the solid
lines?

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.189
109.5°?
 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:24.408
Student:  90°?.
 

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:28.000
Prof: Between the solid
lines, not the wedges?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.139
Student:  Oh, 180°.
 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:30.830
Prof: 180°.
 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.990
How about the other angles?
 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.639
Student:  90°.
 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.008
Prof: 90°, right?
 

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.508
This is a square plane,
drawn that way.

00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:41.449
The dash has to go the other
way, and the lines that are in

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.506
the plane of the board,
or the piece of paper,

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:46.340
have to be at 109°.
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.490
Okay, so forget that one.
 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.509
I assure you that we will get
these on exams,

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.050
because we always have in the
past;

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.160
but this is warning.
 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.340
Okay, so that one's planar,
forget that.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.560
How about this one?
 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.500
There I've got the wedges drawn
the right way.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.870
Everything else right?
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.770
No, the solid lines in the
plane are 180°.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.240
That one's bad obviously.
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.909
Not many people draw it that
way.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.128
Okay?
 

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:18.909
Ah, there's one that looks
pretty good.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.740
Everybody agree?
 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.400
Any complaints?
 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.639
Lucas, what's the complaint?
 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.419
Student:  An acute angle
there.

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:33.120
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.690
Student:  An acute
angle, over there.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.550
Prof: Ah,
the angles between the normal

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.669
lines and the wedge are all less
than 90°.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
Well one of them is bigger than
90°, the one to the top.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.158
But the one to the bottom is
less than 90°,

00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:50.919
if the normal line is in the
plane of the screen.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.660
Right?
 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.900
That's an acute angle.
 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.479
Right?
 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:59.620
So the one on the top left is
the one you want to go for.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.509
Okay?
 

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:03.159
Now how about this?
 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:08.430
Do those look good?
 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.439
See any problems?
 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.220
Kate, what do you say?
 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.569
Looks fine to you.
 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:27.540
Tell me what the angle is here,
between this bond and this one.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.012
Where would this bond point if
it were 90°

00:04:30.012 --> 00:04:32.319
from this one,
which is in the plane of the

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:32.870
board?
 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.230
Student:  Straight out.
 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.879
Prof: It would point
straight out.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:38.127
Now if at 90°
it would be coming straight out

00:04:38.127 --> 00:04:38.970
from that point.
 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.899
How about there?
 

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:42.470
Is this angle greater than or
less than 90°?

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.887
Here's the carbon,
here's the one that's in the

00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:52.370
plane of the board.
 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.220
Right?
 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.680
It's going like that.
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.829
Here's the one -- that's
90°, right?

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:02.591
Suppose I bend it up like this,
which is what the wedge shows,

00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:04.009
now what's the angle?
 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:05.699
Student:  It's acute.
 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.810
Prof: It's acute, right?
 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.180
So these are not right, right?
 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.329
The same is true at the bottom.
 

00:05:11.329 --> 00:05:16.192
But this structure is okay
because, by convention,

00:05:16.192 --> 00:05:20.360
it doesn't mean to show the
exact angle.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.872
It just means to show that it's
going relatively out,

00:05:25.872 --> 00:05:26.720
right?
 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.899
But it wouldn't be -- the solid
-- these three lines here,

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.872
this one, this one,
this one, the ones that are not

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:35.910
wedges and not dashes,
could not be in the plane of

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:36.519
the board.
 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.680
They'd be 120°
angles, or something like that.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.500
They couldn't be 109°,
right?

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.560
But in order to draw this,
in a finite amount of time,

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.920
when you're writing on paper --
people understand what you mean,

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.139
in this case -- but if you draw
that one,

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.449
which means it's planar,
people will be very much

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:54.980
offended.
 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.389
Right?
 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.817
Okay, so this again,
at a certain level,

00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.440
is lore.
 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.935
You have to be criticized
before you find out where you're

00:06:02.935 --> 00:06:04.040
making mistakes.
 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.560
Okay?
 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.495
But anyhow, it's important to
be sensitive about the fact that

00:06:08.495 --> 00:06:09.649
carbon is tetrahedral.
 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:14.050
Now, these things are hard to
do in three dimensions.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.555
And the Fischer projection was
invented for that purpose in

00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:19.100
1891.
 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.569
And the reason for its
invention was interesting.

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.911
He wrote:
"With the help of

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:28.490
Friedländer's convenient
rubber models,

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.810
one can construct molecules of
right-handed tartaric acid,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.473
left-handed tartaric acid,
and inactive tartaric acid and

00:06:36.473 --> 00:06:40.204
lay them in the plane of the
paper so that the four carbon

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:44.000
atoms are in a straight line and
the attached hydrogens and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.600
hydroxyls lie above the plane of
the paper."

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.435
Now, here's the idea,
that Friedländer's models

00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:54.819
used rubber tubing to connect
these things.

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:56.360
Right?
 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.247
So drawing this in two
dimensions and making clear what

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:00.959
you mean in three is not easy.
 

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:03.831
But he says what you're going
to do is take the four carbons

00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:06.870
that are in a chain --
this is tartaric acid,

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.819
here's CO_2,
carbon with an OH,

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:14.509
carbon with an OH and a carbon
with O_2 on it,

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:15.338
right?
 

00:07:15.338 --> 00:07:19.396
So what he wants to do is to
lay all four carbons in the

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:22.420
plane of the paper,
which you can't do.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.839
Right?
 

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:29.170
But if the bonds are made of
rubber, then you can bend the

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.759
bonds -- right?
 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:33.923
-- and then you can make them
all four, in the plane of the

00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:34.360
paper.
 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.899
Right?
 

00:07:35.899 --> 00:07:41.026
But what you have to understand
is that in this convention you

00:07:41.026 --> 00:07:44.639
draw the four carbons vertical
in a line;

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.879
not horizontal.
 

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:50.408
And then you understand that
the bonds between them are

00:07:50.408 --> 00:07:51.750
severely bent.
 

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:52.509
Right?
 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:55.918
So that the curious thing is
that when you draw a Fischer

00:07:55.918 --> 00:07:58.807
projection,
as is most convenient for

00:07:58.807 --> 00:08:03.129
sugars, for discussing the
configuration of sugars,

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:06.997
the bond, the four bonds for
this carbon are understood that

00:08:06.997 --> 00:08:09.021
these two,
the horizontal ones,

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.875
come out toward you,
as if they were wedges,

00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:15.889
and the other two from this
carbon go back into the board.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:17.959
Okay?
 

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:20.778
This is his paper where he
originally proposed it.

00:08:20.778 --> 00:08:24.158
Nowadays you wouldn't use dots
here, which help make it clear

00:08:24.158 --> 00:08:26.750
that it's going back,
you'd just draw lines.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.617
But understand that vertical
lines mean they're going back

00:08:30.617 --> 00:08:33.332
into the board,
and horizontal lines mean

00:08:33.332 --> 00:08:35.370
they're coming out at you.
 

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:39.296
Okay, so that's the Fischer
convention, that he invented in

00:08:39.296 --> 00:08:39.769
1891.
 

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:44.230
So this bond here is a very
funny bond,

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.590
because in bonding from this
carbon to this carbon,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:49.759
it's going back into the board
from this carbon,

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:52.669
but also back into the board
from that carbon,

00:08:52.669 --> 00:08:54.100
because it's bent.
 

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.490
Okay?
 

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.768
And it was because
Friedländer made his models

00:08:57.768 --> 00:09:00.229
with rubber tubing that it
occurred to Fischer that you

00:09:00.229 --> 00:09:01.048
could do this.
 

00:09:01.048 --> 00:09:04.446
And then all you have to do is
draw straight lines -- you don't

00:09:04.446 --> 00:09:07.841
have to do wedges and so on --
and just put things in the right

00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:08.389
place.
 

00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:12.701
So here he could draw
right-handed tartaric acid,

00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:16.924
left-handed tartaric acid,
and inactive or meso,

00:09:16.924 --> 00:09:20.250
as we call it now,
tartaric acid.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.972
So the attached hydrogens and
hydroxyls lie above the plane of

00:09:24.972 --> 00:09:26.600
the paper -- right?
 

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.288
-- and the other carbons,
vertical bonds,

00:09:29.288 --> 00:09:32.850
go back in from both of the
atoms that they attach.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.389
Okay, so there are the wedges.
 

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:39.214
And if you rotated that
90°, it would look like

00:09:39.214 --> 00:09:39.750
that.
 

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.890
Very highly distorted,
but you can do it with rubber

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.710
and be clear about what the
configuration is -- unambiguous.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.892
Okay, they go back from both
carbons, and it was because you

00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:53.940
had rubber models that you could
do that.

00:09:57.009 --> 00:10:00.019
Okay, so here are those models.
 

00:10:00.019 --> 00:10:04.350
And notice that you can rotate
in-plane by 180°,

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.899
and it means the same thing.
 

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:10.803
So if I have this and it's bent
like this, and I rotate it like

00:10:10.803 --> 00:10:13.450
that, 180°,
it obviously means the same

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.080
thing.
 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.269
Right?
 

00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:18.066
I can rotate a Fischer
projection by 180°

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:20.100
and it's still the same model.
 

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:26.927
But I can't rotate it by
180° -- or by 90°

00:10:26.927 --> 00:10:28.460
this way.
 

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.820
Why not?
 

00:10:32.629 --> 00:10:35.600
If I write it this way it won't
mean the same thing.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.580
Why not?
 

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:38.720
Shai?
 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.240
Student:  Because a
number of horizontal bonds are

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.538
going in.
 

00:10:40.538 --> 00:10:42.496
Prof: Yeah,
the horizontal bonds are going

00:10:42.496 --> 00:10:44.740
back in, and the vertical ones
are coming out at you.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.440
You've reflected it in a
mirror, each carbon.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.104
So you could rotate it
180°, but you can't rotate

00:10:52.104 --> 00:10:53.269
it 90°.
 

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:55.360
Okay?
 

00:11:00.298 --> 00:11:03.419
So there, we'll rotate that
180°.

00:11:03.419 --> 00:11:04.428
That's still fine.
 

00:11:04.428 --> 00:11:08.429
And in fact what do you notice
about it, other than the fact

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:11.210
that the symbols are written
backwards?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:14.798
Student:  The same thing.
 

00:11:14.798 --> 00:11:16.490
Prof: It's the same
thing it was above.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:17.820
Right?
 

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.350
So rotating it 180°
doesn't change it.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:22.379
Okay?
 

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:25.080
How about the next one,
if you rotate it 180°?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.529
Same as above?
 

00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:32.370
Yes.
 

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:33.929
How about the last one?
 

00:11:38.259 --> 00:11:39.450
Okay.
 

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.740
That one is now the mirror
image.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.746
If you slide it up,
like that, you can see that

00:11:44.746 --> 00:11:46.840
there would be a mirror there.
 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.470
Everybody with me?
 

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:52.750
So that molecule is its own
mirror image,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.405
whereas the first two -- and
remember you can draw the mirror

00:11:57.405 --> 00:12:01.519
any direction and always get the
same mirror image;

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.866
xy, yz,
xz, they all give the

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:06.120
same mirror image,
just differently oriented.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.038
Another way to draw the mirror
one,

00:12:08.038 --> 00:12:10.096
that's easier,
is to draw it right through the

00:12:10.096 --> 00:12:11.879
middle of the molecule
horizontally,

00:12:11.879 --> 00:12:15.309
and then the top half is the
mirror image of the bottom.

00:12:15.309 --> 00:12:15.620
Right?
 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.210
So it's obviously not a chiral
molecule.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.456
It's superimposable on its
mirror image,

00:12:22.456 --> 00:12:27.370
whereas the -- and that one's
called meso, the name then;

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.994
that was called
meso-tartaric acid and

00:12:29.994 --> 00:12:33.633
the name was generalized to mean
any molecule which is its own

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:35.840
mirror image is
"meso".

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.308
Okay?
 

00:12:37.308 --> 00:12:42.350
And notice that these terms
name relationships.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.063
They don't name an absolute
molecule, these stereochemical

00:12:47.063 --> 00:12:49.379
terms, the ones like this.
 

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:52.029
What's the relationship between
those two?

00:12:52.029 --> 00:12:55.480
Are they identical,
or are they just plain

00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.782
different, or are they different
in the special way that they're

00:13:00.782 --> 00:13:08.149
mirror images of one another;
the two on the top left?

00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:09.129
Student:  They're just
different.

00:13:09.129 --> 00:13:11.000
Prof: Okay?
 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.799
Can you rotate them and make
them be on top of one another?

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:15.320
No.
 

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.712
If you rotate them,
they become the same thing they

00:13:17.712 --> 00:13:18.909
were originally,
right?

00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:20.070
That's what we already did.
 

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.450
Are they mirror images of one
another?

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.000
Right.
 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.063
There's a vertical mirror
between them,

00:13:27.063 --> 00:13:27.710
right?
 

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:31.399
So those are non-superimposable
mirror images.

00:13:31.399 --> 00:13:34.187
And the name given to things
like that is

00:13:34.187 --> 00:13:35.928
"enantiomer".
 

00:13:35.928 --> 00:13:38.101
So the one on the left,
the top left,

00:13:38.101 --> 00:13:41.240
is the enantiomer of the one
that's in the middle.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:44.570
Caitlyn, what's the question?
 

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:48.090
Student:  Okay.
 

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.428
It's just the notation I guess.
 

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:51.558
If the OOH were on the other
side.

00:13:51.558 --> 00:13:54.134
Prof: Oh no,
but that's -- but all that

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.538
means is the grouping C double
bond OOH.

00:13:56.538 --> 00:13:59.135
That doesn't have any
arrangement in space when it's

00:13:59.135 --> 00:14:01.019
just written with letters that
way.

00:14:01.019 --> 00:14:02.070
Okay?
 

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.159
That was just because I wanted
to make strictly the rotation.

00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:06.940
Right?
 

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.779
It's where the bonds point that
makes a difference.

00:14:08.779 --> 00:14:10.288
Okay?
 

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:13.410
Now, how about the relationship
between the middle and the

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:13.850
right?
 

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.610
Are those identical;
are they superimposable?

00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:23.919
Elizabeth, what do you think?
 

00:14:23.919 --> 00:14:25.100
Student:  No.
 

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:27.561
Prof: No you can't move
those, or rotate them any way,

00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:29.120
and make them on top of one
another.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.919
Are they mirror images?
 

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:31.590
Student:  No.
 

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:32.879
Prof: So what are they?
 

00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:34.019
Student:  Diastereomers.
 

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:35.080
Prof: They're just plain
different.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.600
They're diastereomers.
 

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:40.565
So the one in the middle is the
enantiomer of the one on the

00:14:40.565 --> 00:14:44.058
left but the diastereomer of the
one on the right.

00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:47.072
So you don't say it's a
diastereomer,

00:14:47.072 --> 00:14:49.080
or it's an enantiomer.
 

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.519
You say it's a diastereomer of
this and an enantiomer of that.

00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.639
Right?
 

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:57.940
So these name relationships.
 

00:14:57.940 --> 00:14:58.889
Okay?
 

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:02.460
Okay, how about those two,
the first and the last?

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.950
What's the proper relationship
there?

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.659
Maria?
 

00:15:06.659 --> 00:15:07.590
Student:  Diastereomer.
 

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:08.779
Prof: Right,
diastereomer.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:10.528
Good, so we got the idea.
 

00:15:10.528 --> 00:15:16.870
Okay now, how many isomers do
you have?

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:19.352
Obviously if you have one
chiral center you have

00:15:19.352 --> 00:15:22.311
right-handed and left-handed,
if there are four different

00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:23.210
things on it.
 

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.528
So there are two isomers.
 

00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:26.808
But suppose you have several
chiral centers.

00:15:26.808 --> 00:15:29.269
That's not so obvious then how
many you have.

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:32.960
So if you have n
stereogenic centers,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:36.657
as they're called,
and each could be right or

00:15:36.657 --> 00:15:38.990
left,
then you'd imagine the number

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.110
of permutations would be
2^n.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.340
Right?
 

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.990
That would be expected.
 

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.428
But that's not true because of
meso compounds.

00:15:48.428 --> 00:15:52.197
And we'll illustrate that with
a quote from van't Hoff's

00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:54.496
brochure,
in 1877, where he said:

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:57.644
"Next we consider a
symmetrical formula"

00:15:57.644 --> 00:15:59.586
(where carbon,
the first carbon,

00:15:59.586 --> 00:16:00.558
has one, two,
three;

00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:03.357
the next one has two fours,
and the last one has one,

00:16:03.357 --> 00:16:05.350
two, three, different
substituents;

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.624
and also the one where the two
in the middle are different,

00:16:08.624 --> 00:16:10.769
four and five on the middle
carbon.)

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:15.154
"As is easily conceived
from the foregoing discussion,

00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:18.178
they lead to only three
isomers."

00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.458
Because you have this
possibility of meso,

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.350
that we just were talking
about.

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:26.990
Although this is with three
centers possibly in the second

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.480
one.
 

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:33.777
Now, Baeyer and Fischer were --
Baeyer, a student of

00:16:33.777 --> 00:16:39.210
Kekulé,
was the teacher of Fischer.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:43.754
And they got together at a
resort on the shore of the

00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:47.474
Mediterranean,
in Italy, and were trying to

00:16:47.474 --> 00:16:52.101
figure out this particular
question of how many isomers you

00:16:52.101 --> 00:16:53.139
have here.
 

00:16:53.139 --> 00:16:54.610
And they had read van't Hoff's
thing.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.259
So they knew there were
supposed to be three isomers.

00:16:57.259 --> 00:16:59.269
So they were sitting at
breakfast and they had bread

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:00.528
rolls and they had toothpicks.
 

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:03.490
So they started making models
of these and trying to count how

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.220
many isomers.
 

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.669
But they ran out of bread
rolls, presumably,

00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:08.720
and couldn't answer the
questions.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.750
They were completely flummoxed
by trying to understand what

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.420
van't Hoff was saying.
 

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.568
So they gave up on using bread
rolls.

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:19.750
And that is what prompted
Fischer to go back and figure

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.990
out how to make Fischer
projections.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.450
Okay?
 

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.094
Now let's look at that
particular case using Fischer

00:17:27.094 --> 00:17:27.818
projections.
 

00:17:27.818 --> 00:17:31.778
So we have these three carbons
that might have four different

00:17:31.778 --> 00:17:32.900
things on them.
 

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.922
The one in the middle is a
little bit tough to decide,

00:17:35.922 --> 00:17:39.172
because the ones on -- as to
whether it has four different

00:17:39.172 --> 00:17:39.798
things.
 

00:17:39.798 --> 00:17:42.200
Obviously it has H,
OH, and a carbon.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.855
But those carbons that are
attached are identical

00:17:46.855 --> 00:17:48.700
constitutionally.
 

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.690
They have the same nature and
sequence of bonds,

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.298
things attached to them,
but they might or might not be

00:17:54.298 --> 00:17:56.858
the same from the point of view
of stereochemistry.

00:17:56.858 --> 00:17:59.180
So it's not so obvious how this
is going to work out.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.058
But it turns out that it's
really easy, if you use Fisher

00:18:02.058 --> 00:18:02.779
projections.
 

00:18:02.779 --> 00:18:04.058
And we'll try it here.
 

00:18:04.058 --> 00:18:06.868
So here are the five carbons in
a row,

00:18:06.868 --> 00:18:09.098
the top and the bottom one
being COOHs,

00:18:09.098 --> 00:18:10.769
and you have the three carbons
in the middle,

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:13.900
each of which has an H and an
OH on it,

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.588
but they could be either way.
 

00:18:15.588 --> 00:18:20.119
So at first glance it looks
like 2^3, or eight possible

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:20.960
isomers.
 

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.204
So let's check them out,
instead of using bread rolls,

00:18:24.204 --> 00:18:25.920
using Fischer projections.
 

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.189
So we'll draw eight Fischer
projections, and try to be

00:18:29.189 --> 00:18:31.719
systematic and draw all the
possibilities,

00:18:31.719 --> 00:18:33.200
and then count them.
 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.154
Okay, so first of all take the
bottom carbon,

00:18:36.154 --> 00:18:39.711
and we'll put in the top row
all the OHs to the right,

00:18:39.711 --> 00:18:43.068
and in the bottom row all the
OHs to the left.

00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:47.048
And then we'll do the analogous
thing with the second row,

00:18:47.048 --> 00:18:49.970
except we'll make the first two
to the right,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.609
the next two to the left,
the next two to the right,

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:52.589
the next two the left.
 

00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:53.828
Okay?
 

00:18:53.828 --> 00:18:55.990
And finally what are we going
to do on the top row?

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:01.690
Can you see how we're going to
-- so that we get all eight?

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.220
We'll go right,
left, right,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.578
left, right,
left, right,

00:19:04.578 --> 00:19:05.088
left.
 

00:19:05.088 --> 00:19:07.220
Okay, and now we've got all the
possibilities.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:10.596
So now we have to go through
them one by one and see if

00:19:10.596 --> 00:19:13.411
they're unique,
or how they are related to the

00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:15.349
others, if they're related.
 

00:19:15.349 --> 00:19:17.630
Are they diastereomers?
 

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.700
Are they enantiomers?
 

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.210
Are they identical?
 

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.990
And we're going to use these
Fischer projections to do it.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.809
Okay, so we've got the first
one.

00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:26.298
Okay?
 

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:29.909
And now we look at the second
one and compare it to the first

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:30.269
one.
 

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:33.049
Is it the same?
 

00:19:33.049 --> 00:19:33.920
Student:  No.
 

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.650
Prof: No.
 

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:39.220
Are they superimposable?
 

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.009
Student:  No.
 

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:42.240
Prof: No,
that would make them the same.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.140
Are they mirror images?
 

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.039
Student:  No.
 

00:19:46.039 --> 00:19:47.059
Prof: No.
 

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:49.710
So two is different, right?
 

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:50.900
They're diastereomers.
 

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.710
Okay, now about how the next
one, three?

00:19:57.759 --> 00:20:00.282
Is it like any of the previous
ones, or the mirror image of any

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:01.220
of the previous ones?
 

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:01.798
Student:  No.
 

00:20:01.798 --> 00:20:03.569
Prof: No,
three is unique.

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:06.690
Okay, now how about four?
 

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.619
Does it look like any of the
preceding ones?

00:20:10.619 --> 00:20:12.858
Wilson?
 

00:20:12.858 --> 00:20:14.180
Student:  It's a
rotation of two.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:16.559
Prof: Ah,
you can rotate it 180°;

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:18.250
which you can allow, right?
 

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.209
That'll keep the bonds pointing
back, in the convention,

00:20:21.209 --> 00:20:21.640
right?
 

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.849
And it'll look like two.
 

00:20:22.849 --> 00:20:25.890
So that one actually is two.
 

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.769
So we'll blank it out.
 

00:20:27.769 --> 00:20:30.440
Now how about the first one in
the bottom row here?

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.319
Does it look like one?
 

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:34.269
No.
 

00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:36.680
Does it look like three?
 

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.559
No.
 

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:41.318
Does it look like two?
 

00:20:41.318 --> 00:20:45.298
Student:
&gt;

00:20:45.298 --> 00:20:48.210
Prof: That's not so
easy, right?

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.190
But it's not superimposable.
 

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.711
If you rotate it 180°,
about the axis into the screen,

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.750
it still doesn't look like two.
 

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:57.549
Right?
 

00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:58.430
So it's different.
 

00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:59.940
Four.
 

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.049
How about the next one?
 

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:13.558
Virginia, you got an idea?
 

00:21:13.558 --> 00:21:17.650
Does this one here look like
any of the previous ones,

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.038
if we rotate it?
 

00:21:19.038 --> 00:21:19.890
Student:  Well,
it's the mirror image of three.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.038
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:21:21.038 --> 00:21:23.960
Student:  Yeah,
it looks like three.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.430
Prof: Ah ha,
it's like three.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.880
If we rotate it 180°
it's like three.

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.289
So forget that one.
 

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.858
How about the next one?
 

00:21:30.858 --> 00:21:34.490
Does it look like anybody we've
already seen?

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.109
Student:  Four.
 

00:21:36.109 --> 00:21:37.338
Prof: Four.
 

00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.759
Right, if you rotate it
180° it's four.

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:42.089
Okay.
 

00:21:42.089 --> 00:21:43.599
And the last one?
 

00:21:43.599 --> 00:21:44.220
Student:  One.
 

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.289
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.670
Lexy, what do you say?
 

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:51.680
Student:  It's the same
as one.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.630
Prof: It's one,
if you rotate it 180°.

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.970
Okay.
 

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:58.099
So we've got these four that
are different.

00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.349
Now what are the relationships?
 

00:21:59.349 --> 00:22:05.240
Okay, are any of them meso?
 

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:10.086
Do any of them have mirror
planes, so that their own --

00:22:10.086 --> 00:22:13.049
they're their own mirror image.
 

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:14.849
Angela?
 

00:22:14.849 --> 00:22:16.240
Student:  One.
 

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.720
Prof: One has a mirror
image.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.369
The top is the mirror image of
the bottom.

00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:20.349
There's the mirror.
 

00:22:20.349 --> 00:22:21.970
Any others?
 

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:22.730
Student:  Three.
 

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:23.960
Prof: Three.
 

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:28.828
Okay, but not two or four.
 

00:22:28.828 --> 00:22:33.890
Anything else that you want to
note about two and four?

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.589
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:38.660
Prof: Sophie?
 

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.368
Student:  They're mirror
images.

00:22:39.368 --> 00:22:40.700
Prof: They're mirror
images of one another.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.930
Okay?
 

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:51.601
So what we have are two meso
isomers -- they're diastereomers

00:22:51.601 --> 00:22:53.470
of one another,
right?

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:55.160
-- and a pair of enantiomers.
 

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.461
Each of those enantiomers is
the enantiomer of one another,

00:22:58.461 --> 00:23:01.365
and the diastereomer of either
of the previous ones,

00:23:01.365 --> 00:23:02.390
one and three.
 

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.329
Okay, so with Fischer
projections he could easily

00:23:05.329 --> 00:23:06.740
settle this question.
 

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:10.705
And that became very important
in the chemistry of sugars,

00:23:10.705 --> 00:23:14.255
where Fischer was deeply
involved, as we'll see next

00:23:14.255 --> 00:23:15.160
semester.
 

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.702
Okay, now here's Halichondrin
B, which comes from a marine

00:23:19.702 --> 00:23:21.950
sponge;
as it says here.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:22.778
Okay?
 

00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:25.910
Now, you don't get very much of
this out of a sponge.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:27.078
Right?
 

00:23:27.078 --> 00:23:31.608
But it was found that it was
useful in anticancer therapy.

00:23:31.608 --> 00:23:37.037
So the hope was you could make
it and then see if it will work

00:23:37.037 --> 00:23:38.548
as a good drug.
 

00:23:38.548 --> 00:23:42.868
So it was found that you don't
need the whole molecule.

00:23:42.868 --> 00:23:46.644
If you cut it apart,
to have only this portion we've

00:23:46.644 --> 00:23:49.680
seen here, then that part is
just as good,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.420
medically, as the whole
molecule.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.309
So that simplifies the
synthesis problem quite a bit.

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:57.048
But it's still non-trivial.
 

00:23:57.048 --> 00:24:00.838
So there's the active fragment
of Halichondrin B.

00:24:00.838 --> 00:24:04.368
And SAR means Structure
Activity Relationship.

00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:06.048
They take off this,
take off that,

00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:08.931
trim it here and so on,
change one thing to another

00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:11.098
thing,
and see if you can get better

00:24:11.098 --> 00:24:14.000
activity than you get from just
this thing itself;

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.942
and especially looking to
changes that would make it

00:24:16.942 --> 00:24:18.269
easier to synthesize.
 

00:24:18.269 --> 00:24:19.640
Okay?
 

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.920
So they found out that this
one, which is called E7389,

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.675
that model, is about as easy as
you can get to synthesize and

00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:31.529
still have really good activity.
 

00:24:31.529 --> 00:24:34.269
But it's not easy to synthesize.
 

00:24:34.269 --> 00:24:37.650
And you have the question that
you have to get the right

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:41.400
diastereomer because the other
diastereomers are different.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:44.038
Now how big a problem is that
going to be?

00:24:44.038 --> 00:24:47.920
Well it depends on how many
stereogenic centers there are;

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.122
how many carbons can generate
two isomers, by being right or

00:24:52.122 --> 00:24:53.118
left-handed.
 

00:24:53.118 --> 00:24:56.288
So let's start up here at the
left,

00:24:56.288 --> 00:24:59.269
and I'll go along this chain,
like that,

00:24:59.269 --> 00:25:04.150
and you stop me when we get to
a carbon that's chiral,

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:05.650
that's stereogenic.
 

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.240
Okay?
 

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.297
So I'll start here,
at the top left,

00:25:08.297 --> 00:25:09.650
and I'm going across.
 

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.019
Stop me when I get to one.
 

00:25:11.019 --> 00:25:13.089
Oh, you didn't tell me.
 

00:25:13.089 --> 00:25:14.490
Student:  That one.
 

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.813
Prof: That one looks --
well you say oh that has only

00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:17.640
three things on it.
 

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:21.588
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:25:21.588 --> 00:25:24.376
Prof: You have to have
four different things,

00:25:24.376 --> 00:25:25.470
to be stereogenic.
 

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.539
Does anybody think that one is
stereogenic?

00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:32.720
Chenyu?
 

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.839
Student: It left the
hydrogen out.

00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:35.548
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:25:35.548 --> 00:25:36.680
Student: It doesn't have
the hydrogen in it.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.029
Prof: Ah,
it doesn't show the hydrogen;

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:39.308
the hydrogens aren't being
shown.

00:25:39.308 --> 00:25:41.529
So there are,
in fact, four different things

00:25:41.529 --> 00:25:44.627
on that third atom -- nitrogen,
carbon, but the second carbon

00:25:44.627 --> 00:25:45.609
is stereogenic.
 

00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:46.470
Okay?
 

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:48.700
So there's one.
 

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.109
Now let's keep going.
 

00:25:50.109 --> 00:25:51.680
How about here, that one?
 

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.150
No, that one has two hydrogens.
 

00:25:54.150 --> 00:25:55.759
How about this one?
 

00:25:55.759 --> 00:25:56.539
Students:  Yes.
 

00:25:56.539 --> 00:25:57.670
Prof: That's stereogenic.
 

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.960
How about this one?
 

00:25:58.960 --> 00:25:59.579
Students:  Yes.
 

00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:00.210
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.690
How about this one?
 

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:02.259
Students:  Yes.
 

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:03.150
Prof: Okay?
 

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.130
How about this one?
 

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.180
Students:  Yes.
 

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.369
Prof: Okay,
how about this one?

00:26:08.369 --> 00:26:09.309
This one?
 

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:11.609
This one?
 

00:26:11.609 --> 00:26:12.348
Students:  Yes.
 

00:26:12.348 --> 00:26:13.962
Prof: Ah,
that's got four bonds already,

00:26:13.962 --> 00:26:14.700
no hydrogens there.
 

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.980
Okay, that one's not.
 

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.299
There?
 

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:19.539
Here?
 

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:20.769
Okay there.
 

00:26:20.769 --> 00:26:22.349
There?
 

00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:23.420
There?
 

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.470
There?
 

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.230
Yeah, that's got four.
 

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:27.500
There?
 

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.230
Students:  Yes.
 

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.359
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:30.869
There?
 

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:33.200
Students:  Yes.
 

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.991
Prof: Yeah,
four different things,

00:26:34.991 --> 00:26:36.829
because you have to count the
hydrogen.

00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:37.369
Here?
 

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:42.609
Yeah, the hydrogen also.
 

00:26:42.609 --> 00:26:45.529
That one shows the hydrogen.
 

00:26:45.529 --> 00:26:47.700
Okay.
 

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:48.940
Here?
 

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.750
Yeah.
 

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.740
Here?
 

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.799
Here, no.
 

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:57.660
Here?
 

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.039
Well you say there are two
oxygens.

00:26:59.039 --> 00:27:00.250
Right?
 

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.250
Are they the same?
 

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.150
Student:  No.
 

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:03.723
Prof: No,
they're attached to different

00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:04.039
things.
 

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.039
Right?
 

00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:05.869
So that one too.
 

00:27:05.869 --> 00:27:07.359
Okay, here?
 

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:09.240
No, no.
 

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:10.000
Here?
 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.890
Student:  Yes.
 

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.200
Prof: How many think so?
 

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.630
Yeah, right, that one.
 

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:18.839
The next one?
 

00:27:18.839 --> 00:27:20.160
This one?
 

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.900
Student:  No.
 

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.410
Prof: Yes or no here?
 

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.130
Students:  No.
 

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:23.730
Prof: No.
 

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.349
Here?
 

00:27:24.349 --> 00:27:25.569
Students:  Yes.
 

00:27:25.569 --> 00:27:26.490
Prof: Yes.
 

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:27.599
Here?
 

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:28.400
Students:  No.
 

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.390
Prof: Speak up.
 

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.240
Students:  No.
 

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.240
Yes.
 

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.779
No.
 

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:37.059
Yes.
 

00:27:37.059 --> 00:27:38.890
No.
 

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:40.038
Yes.
 

00:27:40.038 --> 00:27:41.839
Prof: And there's one
more carbon here.

00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:43.730
Students:  No.
 

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.599
Prof: No. Okay.
 

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:46.150
Well done.
 

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.548
There are nineteen stereogenic
centers.

00:27:48.548 --> 00:27:52.839
That means there are 2^19^(
)possible isomers.

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:55.338
Will any of them be meso?
 

00:27:55.338 --> 00:27:58.808
Are you going to get any mirror
images within this molecule?

00:27:58.808 --> 00:28:01.170
No, it's completely
unsymmetric, right?

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:02.578
It's not like tartaric acid.
 

00:28:02.578 --> 00:28:05.567
So there are going to be
something like -- something

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:08.730
greater than half a million
configurational isomers.

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.868
So it's not just a question of
putting the right groups in the

00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:13.618
right place to get constitution.
 

00:28:13.618 --> 00:28:17.657
You have to put them
stereochemically correct,

00:28:17.657 --> 00:28:20.799
to get one out of million,
right?

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.650
So this is a problem.
 

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:25.670
But they figured out how to do
it.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.624
And this, I just got this,
this morning,

00:28:28.624 --> 00:28:30.670
off the web -- pardon me.
 

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.583
It's a -- it'll say so at the
top -- but this is the current

00:28:33.583 --> 00:28:35.410
report on clinical testing of
this;

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.490
so testing in humans.
 

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.190
Some of them are in -- like if
you look at the top one,

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:40.288
it's in phase three.
 

00:28:40.288 --> 00:28:43.960
In phase one they test for
toxicity with humans;

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.970
obviously if it's toxic,
you can't use it as a drug.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.180
The next one they test
"does it work?"

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.788
And the third they test whether
it's better than current things

00:28:52.788 --> 00:28:55.349
for doing it,
and what the proper dose should

00:28:55.349 --> 00:28:56.338
be and so on.
 

00:28:56.338 --> 00:28:59.753
So this is phase three trials,
and they're recruiting people

00:28:59.753 --> 00:29:01.741
to --
I'm sorry, I got -- pressed the

00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:04.296
wrong button --
they're recruiting subjects for

00:29:04.296 --> 00:29:04.519
it.
 

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:06.730
They already have 1100 people
in it.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:11.528
It started in June 2006,
and this was updated last May,

00:29:11.528 --> 00:29:17.130
and it's to -- it doesn't have
a completion date given there.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.098
This one has a completion date
of March 2010.

00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:22.730
But in fact this is the
objective, to see what the

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.130
quality of life is;
tumor response rate;

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:28.028
duration of response;
how many survive one,

00:29:28.028 --> 00:29:31.528
two and three years,
in this breast cancer test.

00:29:31.528 --> 00:29:33.894
And it's being compared with
another drug,

00:29:33.894 --> 00:29:34.990
as it says there.
 

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:40.436
So here's what they're
comparing in the two different

00:29:40.436 --> 00:29:41.380
things.
 

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.990
Some people do this,
some people do this.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:46.205
So the drug,
this drug is injected 1.4

00:29:46.205 --> 00:29:50.029
mg/m^2, IV infusion over two to
five minutes,

00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:54.288
on days one and eight,
every twenty-one days.

00:29:54.288 --> 00:29:57.720
And it's being compared with
this drug, which has 2.5

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.743
g/m^2/day, administered orally
twice daily in two equal doses,

00:30:01.743 --> 00:30:03.130
blah, blah, blah.
 

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.058
Okay, so that's the test that's
being undergone now.

00:30:06.058 --> 00:30:09.699
And the estimated primary
completion date is September

00:30:09.699 --> 00:30:10.180
2011.
 

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.298
It's been going since June 2006.
 

00:30:12.298 --> 00:30:16.164
So it's going to be five years
that they're doing this test,

00:30:16.164 --> 00:30:17.410
with 1100 people.
 

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:21.009
So these are really,
really expensive things.

00:30:21.009 --> 00:30:24.424
And you notice it says it's
being -- maybe it was on a

00:30:24.424 --> 00:30:27.970
previous slide -- that it's
being funded by industry.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.259
Because they hope that it'll
work and then they'll be able to

00:30:31.259 --> 00:30:34.493
recoup their costs and make a
profit on the basis of selling

00:30:34.493 --> 00:30:35.809
the drug afterwards.
 

00:30:35.809 --> 00:30:36.390
Okay.
 

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:41.614
If you go to this NIH website,
clinicaltrials.gov,

00:30:41.614 --> 00:30:48.223
you find that they have 64,268
trials in 158 countries going as

00:30:48.223 --> 00:30:49.608
of today.
 

00:30:49.608 --> 00:30:52.567
So these are very,
very long, expensive things,

00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:55.009
to try to get a drug that will
work.

00:30:55.009 --> 00:30:57.950
But making that stuff was
really something.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.429
But if they get a hit,
then the company is on easy

00:31:01.429 --> 00:31:03.630
street, for a while at least.
 

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.630
Like Lipitor.
 

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:07.836
So here's a Lipitor pill,
which is the world's best

00:31:07.836 --> 00:31:08.798
selling drug.
 

00:31:08.798 --> 00:31:11.720
In 2004 it sold almost eleven
billion dollars.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.019
Right?
 

00:31:13.019 --> 00:31:19.507
But it raised a 10 billion
dollar problem in stereochemical

00:31:19.507 --> 00:31:23.868
notation, that I'll show to you
here.

00:31:23.868 --> 00:31:29.019
So this is a news report from
2005, dateline New York.

00:31:29.019 --> 00:31:30.160
"Pfizer Inc.
 

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.048
won a significant victory on
Wednesday when a British judge

00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:38.071
upheld a key patent covering its
blockbuster cholesterol drug

00:31:38.071 --> 00:31:40.420
Lipitor in the United Kingdom.
 

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:43.211
But the medication still faces
a similar yet more important

00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:44.848
case in the United States."
 

00:31:44.848 --> 00:31:48.305
(And that was decided in 2006,
in the same way,

00:31:48.305 --> 00:31:50.858
in the U.S. Court of
Appeals.)

00:31:50.858 --> 00:31:53.140
Okay, so, "Judge Nicholas
Pumfrey"

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.375
(in the High Court in London)
"upheld the patent covering

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:59.009
atorvastatin,
Lipitor's active ingredient,

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:01.588
but ruled that another patent
was invalid.

00:32:01.588 --> 00:32:05.503
Indian pharmaceutical company
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd."

00:32:05.503 --> 00:32:08.961
(a generic chemical company)
"had challenged both

00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:12.550
patents, and was joined by
Britain's Arrow Generics Ltd.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.140
against the second patent that
was ruled invalid.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:19.828
Pfizer said the decision
upholding the exclusivity of the

00:32:19.828 --> 00:32:23.386
patent covering atorvastatin
until November 2011 was an

00:32:23.386 --> 00:32:26.220
important victory for
scientists."

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.990
And perhaps also for
stockholders and executives of

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.670
Pfizer.
 

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.230
Okay?
 

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:34.170
Now, what is patented?
 

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:36.480
Here's the patent that was
under discussion.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.279
This is the U.S. version.
 

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:40.078
There was also a British
version.

00:32:40.078 --> 00:32:44.890
Okay, so it's patent number
4,681,893, from 1987.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:46.200
Okay?
 

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:50.162
So the important part of a
patent is the claims at the end,

00:32:50.162 --> 00:32:51.868
what's to be protected.
 

00:32:51.868 --> 00:32:54.541
And it said,
"I claim a compound of

00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:56.529
structural formula 1."
 

00:32:56.529 --> 00:33:00.058
So this compound, okay?
 

00:33:00.058 --> 00:33:05.940
And notice that it has codes in
here;

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.890
like X can be any of those
groups, linking the right and

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.730
the left;
R_1 can be any of those groups;

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.869
R_2 and R_3_ can be
any of these groups.

00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:17.039
Right?
 

00:33:17.039 --> 00:33:18.599
Still going.
 

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:20.848
R_4 can be any of these groups.
 

00:33:20.848 --> 00:33:24.905
Or it can be a hydroxyl --
instead of being this kind of

00:33:24.905 --> 00:33:26.712
ester,
which is called a lactone,

00:33:26.712 --> 00:33:29.390
it forms a ring --
it could be the acid that you'd

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.009
get from that by hydrolyzing it,
or a salt of that acid.

00:33:33.009 --> 00:33:36.410
Okay, so all those things are
covered in that patent.

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.950
How many molecules are covered
in the patent?

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.548
If you made all the
permutations of those groups,

00:33:42.548 --> 00:33:45.470
you'd find that it's greater
than the number of protons,

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:48.259
neutrons, and electrons in the
solar system.

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:51.750
So it's obviously impossible to
make all the molecules.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.435
You'd need quite a few solar
systems to have enough particles

00:33:55.435 --> 00:33:56.420
to do it with.
 

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.480
Okay?
 

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.839
But the patent is supposed to
protect that.

00:33:59.839 --> 00:34:03.009
Okay, now.
 

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:07.647
So here -- but what is patented
and what was being discussed was

00:34:07.647 --> 00:34:09.710
not what those groups are.
 

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.230
That wasn't in contention.
 

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:15.985
It's known that Lipitor is this
stuff: the calcium salt,

00:34:15.985 --> 00:34:19.059
and it has those particular R
groups on it.

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:22.077
But that wasn't in question,
the fact that it covered so

00:34:22.077 --> 00:34:23.010
many compounds.
 

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:26.730
What was in question was what
the stereochemistry is.

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.289
Because Lipitor,
the drug, is a single

00:34:30.289 --> 00:34:31.539
enantiomer.
 

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:33.570
Right?
 

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.469
Not its mirror image and not a
mixture, not a racemate.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:39.289
Okay?
 

00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:42.487
But the question is,
did this patent cover the

00:34:42.487 --> 00:34:43.909
single enantiomer?
 

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.246
Which is what the picture shows;
although it doesn't show it

00:34:47.246 --> 00:34:47.969
very well.
 

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.789
Why not?
 

00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:52.922
If you were drawing this
structure, on the top right,

00:34:52.922 --> 00:34:54.670
would you draw it that way?
 

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:59.130
How about that carbon?
 

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.219
Does it show its tetrahedron
well?

00:35:01.219 --> 00:35:01.980
Student:  No.
 

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.335
Prof: It certainly
doesn't show 109°

00:35:05.335 --> 00:35:09.056
angles, but it's -- and this
dash should be up here,

00:35:09.056 --> 00:35:10.590
to be even close.
 

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:14.130
How about that carbon?
 

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.385
That's even worse,
if you were trying to really

00:35:16.385 --> 00:35:18.639
show the angle,
because that one's 180°.

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:23.081
But at least it's unambiguous
about that versus its mirror

00:35:23.081 --> 00:35:26.199
image, even though it's not very
good.

00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:27.260
Right?
 

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.809
It's not ambiguous.
 

00:35:28.809 --> 00:35:33.059
So the structure drawn in the
patent was a single enantiomer,

00:35:33.059 --> 00:35:36.599
and it turned out to be the one
that is Lipitor.

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:38.010
Okay?
 

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:43.079
But the text of the patent
didn't do anything.

00:35:43.079 --> 00:35:45.960
It never resolved it and made
it into one enantiomer.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:49.840
It just talked about it
generically.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.570
And what it would be making is
the racemate,

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:54.349
not the single enantiomer.
 

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:56.916
So does the patent cover
Lipitor or doesn't it,

00:35:56.916 --> 00:35:58.760
was the question for the judge.
 

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.059
Okay, so this is his opinion.
 

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.731
He said: "In the '633
patent,"

00:36:03.731 --> 00:36:06.217
(when they talk about patents
they just talk about the last

00:36:06.217 --> 00:36:09.088
three digits,
not the big number) "it is

00:36:09.088 --> 00:36:13.083
absolutely clear from context
throughout that formula (1) is

00:36:13.083 --> 00:36:15.860
being used to denote a
racemate."

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.518
(So what they talked about and
what they prepared,

00:36:18.518 --> 00:36:20.690
tested and so on was both
enantiomers.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:21.260
Okay?)
 

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:25.184
"In my judgment,
every time the skilled person

00:36:25.184 --> 00:36:28.090
sees formula 1 or formula
X,"

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.699
Now, skilled person has a very
special meaning.

00:36:31.699 --> 00:36:34.590
It means someone who is
"skilled in the art",

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.840
that knows about pharmaceutical
chemistry and so on,

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.463
knows what these compounds are,
how to make them and that kind

00:36:40.463 --> 00:36:42.659
of thing,
but is not creative.

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:46.699
Because what you can patent is
original creation.

00:36:46.699 --> 00:36:50.447
So the skilled person knows
everything but can't figure

00:36:50.447 --> 00:36:52.800
anything out;
if you see what I mean,

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.340
can't devise anything new.
 

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.550
Okay so the skilled person sees
these formulas.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.295
"He will see them with
eyes that tell him that in that

00:37:00.295 --> 00:37:02.945
racemate,"
(which is described in the

00:37:02.945 --> 00:37:06.885
text) "there is a single
enantiomer that is the effective

00:37:06.885 --> 00:37:09.275
compound,"
(So even though what's

00:37:09.275 --> 00:37:13.480
described is both,
the person that isn't very

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.231
swift, but is knowledgeable,
knows that within that there'll

00:37:18.231 --> 00:37:20.867
be two mirror images,
and one of them will do the

00:37:20.867 --> 00:37:22.219
trick, and not the other one.
 

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:24.768
So you don't have to be
creative to know that.)

00:37:24.768 --> 00:37:29.373
and he will know "that he
can resolve the racemate using

00:37:29.373 --> 00:37:31.829
conventional techniques."
 

00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:34.335
(He doesn't have to invent
something new,

00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:37.719
in order to get from that
mixture, the one that will be

00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:38.909
the active one.
 

00:37:38.909 --> 00:37:41.420
Okay, so that's not creative.
 

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:43.518
Okay?)
 

00:37:43.518 --> 00:37:46.090
"When one comes to claim
1,

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:49.483
which echoes the purpose of the
invention with its conventional

00:37:49.483 --> 00:37:52.219
reference to pharmaceutically
acceptable salts,

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:55.230
he will, in my judgment,
continue to see the formulae in

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:56.268
this light."
 

00:37:56.268 --> 00:37:59.110
(So the salt's the same deal,
right?)

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:01.972
"In my view,
the claim covers the racemate

00:38:01.972 --> 00:38:04.400
and the individual
enantiomers."

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.449
So the person without any
creativity knows that yes,

00:38:08.449 --> 00:38:10.809
the patent described the
racemate, but there'll be one in

00:38:10.809 --> 00:38:13.130
there that I can get,
and that'll be the useful drug.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.909
And it doesn't take anything
great to get there.

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.179
We'll talk about that soon,
how you would do that;

00:38:18.179 --> 00:38:19.909
why it's well-known.
 

00:38:19.909 --> 00:38:21.469
Okay?
 

00:38:21.469 --> 00:38:23.940
So this is good news for
Pfizer, right?

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.039
Their patent holds.
 

00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:28.773
They put out a press release
saying this is a victory for

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:29.440
science.
 

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.349
Okay?
 

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:37.081
But it's in a sense a pyrrhic
victory, because they had a

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:42.010
later patent,
on the single enantiomer.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.469
Right?
 

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:46.199
And now that patent is invalid.
 

00:38:46.199 --> 00:38:48.510
Because if the first patent
covers it,

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.559
you can't just every three
years come up and say,

00:38:50.559 --> 00:38:52.501
"I patent this
again," "I patent this

00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.597
again," I patent this
again," and keep getting

00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:56.159
another fifteen years of
exclusivity.

00:38:56.159 --> 00:38:57.570
Right?
 

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.559
So once they were covered by
the first patent,

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:02.619
the second patent is invalid.
 

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:04.572
Why do they care,
if they're already covered by

00:39:04.572 --> 00:39:05.380
the first patent?
 

00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.179
Isn't that good news?
 

00:39:07.179 --> 00:39:10.260
Dana?
 

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.246
Student:  Their fifteen
years of exclusivity will run

00:39:12.246 --> 00:39:12.449
out.
 

00:39:12.449 --> 00:39:13.840
Prof: Ah,
they're going to run out.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.202
So this means that three years
earlier their patent is going to

00:39:18.202 --> 00:39:19.539
run out -- right?
 

00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:22.170
-- at four or five billion
dollars a year.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.019
That adds up.
 

00:39:24.019 --> 00:39:26.349
Okay?
 

00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:31.273
Now, so drug -- so there are
conventions for how you name

00:39:31.273 --> 00:39:34.440
things, including
stereochemistry.

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:38.447
In fact, there was a stamp
issued in Switzerland in 1992

00:39:38.447 --> 00:39:42.599
commemorating the 100th year of
the Geneva Convention,

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:45.945
where chemists got together,
once they knew stuff about how

00:39:45.945 --> 00:39:47.329
things were connected.
 

00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:49.628
Then they had to agree on how
to describe it,

00:39:49.628 --> 00:39:52.449
on what the nomenclature and
the notation should be.

00:39:52.449 --> 00:39:55.268
So the International Union of
Pure &amp; Applied Chemistry

00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:56.110
continues this.
 

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.702
And you can go to these
websites and learn about what

00:39:58.702 --> 00:40:00.150
the rules are for notation.
 

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:04.775
So they had to devise rules for
what you want to do when you

00:40:04.775 --> 00:40:07.050
make a name for a compound.
 

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:11.320
So what is maybe the first
thing you want to do?

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.440
Nate?
 

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.789
Student:  You need to --
Prof: No, not you.

00:40:17.789 --> 00:40:22.679
Student:  The other Nate?
 

00:40:22.679 --> 00:40:23.400
Prof: Well let's see.
 

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.269
Let's try somebody else.
 

00:40:24.269 --> 00:40:25.199
Andrew?
 

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:29.250
No, no.
 

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:31.340
Kate?
 

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.489
Kate?
 

00:40:32.489 --> 00:40:33.320
Student:
&gt;.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.710
Prof: Kate,
what was the first rule?

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.182
Student:  They want the
name to discuss composition,

00:40:39.182 --> 00:40:40.420
like which atoms are in it.
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.320
Prof: Well -- I didn't
mean you anyhow.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.909
So what's the first rule about
names?

00:40:47.909 --> 00:40:58.570
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.550
Prof: John?
 

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:00.860
Not you.
 

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:04.059
&gt;
 

00:41:04.059 --> 00:41:05.219
Other Kate?
 

00:41:05.219 --> 00:41:06.800
Student:  They should
describe only one.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.610
Prof: Ah,
they should be unique.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:12.880
There should only be one
compound that has that name.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.766
You shouldn't say,
"Take this,"

00:41:14.766 --> 00:41:17.501
and they take the wrong John or
the wrong Kate or the wrong

00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:18.019
Andrew.
 

00:41:18.019 --> 00:41:18.960
Right?
 

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.722
So the very first thing should
-- well it should be -- Kate,

00:41:22.722 --> 00:41:24.190
you were right first.
 

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:26.771
It has to be clearly
descriptive of what the compound

00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.018
is.
 

00:41:27.018 --> 00:41:29.978
And so it has to tell
composition, constitution,

00:41:29.978 --> 00:41:33.061
configuration and conformation
maybe, if you care,

00:41:33.061 --> 00:41:35.139
i.e., stereochemistry.
 

00:41:35.139 --> 00:41:37.530
And it can be like this.
 

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.139
E7389 was the name of that
compound.

00:41:40.139 --> 00:41:41.965
Forget trying to name it
systematically,

00:41:41.965 --> 00:41:42.949
according to rules.
 

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:44.050
Right?
 

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.175
E is for Eisai,
the name of the pharmaceutical

00:41:47.175 --> 00:41:50.369
company, and this is their
7,389th compound.

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:51.190
Right?
 

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.659
But at least everybody knows
what that means.

00:41:53.659 --> 00:41:54.889
Right?
 

00:41:54.889 --> 00:41:55.949
Or you can look it up.
 

00:41:55.949 --> 00:41:57.909
But this is what we were just
talking about.

00:41:57.909 --> 00:41:59.219
It has to be unambiguous.
 

00:41:59.219 --> 00:42:00.349
Right?
 

00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:02.818
One name must mean one
structure, not some other

00:42:02.818 --> 00:42:03.869
structure as well.
 

00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:06.855
Okay, so unfortunately
"amide"

00:42:06.855 --> 00:42:10.922
doesn't fit that bill,
because it means the anion of

00:42:10.922 --> 00:42:12.831
an amine,
but it also means that

00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:14.719
functional group we're talking
about.

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:15.489
It's the same name.
 

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:18.210
You have to figure out from
context which one you're talking

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:18.579
about.
 

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:21.460
It also has to be unique.
 

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:22.960
One structure is one name.
 

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.460
So everybody will have the same
name for the compound.

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:27.070
Right?
 

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.778
Which is more important,
that it be unambiguous or that

00:42:30.778 --> 00:42:31.809
it be unique?
 

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.409
Like you could have two names
for the same compound;

00:42:39.409 --> 00:42:43.929
like bromobutane and butyl
bromide.

00:42:43.929 --> 00:42:45.860
Right?
 

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.068
And if you put a number in,
you would know which -- where

00:42:49.068 --> 00:42:50.099
the bromine was.
 

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:51.530
Okay?
 

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:55.610
Or bromoethane and ethyl
bromide.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:57.050
Two different names, right?
 

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.829
So the names aren't unique.
 

00:42:59.829 --> 00:43:01.579
Right?
 

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:03.460
But they're unambiguous.
 

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.239
You know what compounds you're
talking about.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:09.119
Why would you care whether you
have just one agreed-on name by

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.998
the people who get together in
the International Union of Pure

00:43:12.998 --> 00:43:14.780
&amp; Applied Chemistry?
 

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.010
Why would care?
 

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.099
What's wrong with having two
names?

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.460
Anybody see any disadvantage to
having different names for the

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.300
same compound?
 

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:29.429
Sam?
 

00:43:29.429 --> 00:43:31.170
I could've called Sam too.
 

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.309
Yeah, go ahead.
 

00:43:33.309 --> 00:43:37.050
Student:  It's hard to
communicate about the stuff.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.510
Prof: Not if everybody
knows what you're talking about.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:42.010
Shai?
 

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.860
Student:  Well like if
something has a lot of names,

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.907
eventually you're going to get
to a point where someone doesn't

00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:48.349
know.
 

00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:50.190
You can say -- you're going to
say a name and they're not going

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:51.230
to know what you're referring
to.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:55.027
Prof: Or if you have to
look it up, you have to choose

00:43:55.027 --> 00:43:56.989
the right name to look it up.
 

00:43:56.989 --> 00:44:00.182
So this was more important,
when you didn't have computers

00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:03.452
to do the work for you,
when you had to look in an

00:44:03.452 --> 00:44:05.864
index and get --
and be looking for the right

00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:08.389
name that everyone agreed,
and the person who made up the

00:44:08.389 --> 00:44:09.429
index entered it there.
 

00:44:09.429 --> 00:44:12.505
Nowadays you can draw a
structure often on a screen,

00:44:12.505 --> 00:44:15.942
and the computer will figure
out what the official name is

00:44:15.942 --> 00:44:17.389
and then look it up.
 

00:44:17.389 --> 00:44:20.864
But anyhow, that -- so it's not
as important that it be unique

00:44:20.864 --> 00:44:22.460
as that it be unambiguous.
 

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:25.123
But if you're looking things
up, it's very nice if you know

00:44:25.123 --> 00:44:27.420
that everybody will have named
it a certain way.

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.106
So you can also index things
according to their composition,

00:44:31.106 --> 00:44:33.920
CHN, or using computer
graphics, as we say.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.780
And, if possible,
the name should be manageable.

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.159
Right?
 

00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:40.800
It should be possible to write
it fairly quickly.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.402
It should be easy to figure out;
short, if possible,

00:44:43.402 --> 00:44:45.204
and pronounceable,
if possible,

00:44:45.204 --> 00:44:47.190
so that you can talk about it.
 

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.302
Now let's look at systematic
constitutional nomenclature,

00:44:51.302 --> 00:44:55.050
for this sort of intermediately
complex compound.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:57.789
Compared to these others we've
looked it's not much.

00:44:57.789 --> 00:45:01.291
Okay, so the first thing you
do, these people decided,

00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.659
when you get together,
is decide what the main chain

00:45:04.659 --> 00:45:05.849
of carbons is.
 

00:45:05.849 --> 00:45:09.932
Because that will provide the
root with a Greek designation

00:45:09.932 --> 00:45:12.820
that says what the number of
things is.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.112
So we have to find a carbon
chain, and we'll find the

00:45:16.112 --> 00:45:17.570
longest carbon chain.
 

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:23.719
We could take this one,
or we could take that one.

00:45:23.719 --> 00:45:24.940
Which one is longer?
 

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:31.119
The one, it could be an octane
or it could be a nonane.

00:45:31.119 --> 00:45:32.349
Which one should we choose?
 

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:33.309
Students: Nonane.
 

00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:36.844
Prof: Well we could've
decided you take the shortest

00:45:36.844 --> 00:45:37.210
one.
 

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:39.119
But that's sort of silly.
 

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:40.789
There'd be a zillion shortest
ones;

00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:42.650
or short ones, right?
 

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:43.530
Or even shortest.
 

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.250
The shortest is one carbon I
guess.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.590
But there's only one longest
one, right?

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:50.619
Wrong.
 

00:45:56.519 --> 00:45:58.929
Because there's also that one.
 

00:45:58.929 --> 00:45:59.849
Same length.
 

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:03.489
So now we have to decide when
we're going to take the longest;

00:46:03.489 --> 00:46:06.389
how are we going to choose,
if there are two of them?

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:12.030
Well what you choose by is the
number of substituents.

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.809
Okay?
 

00:46:13.809 --> 00:46:16.501
Because that one has one,
one, three, four,

00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:19.000
five substituents,
and this one has four

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.090
substituents.
 

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.572
Which will you choose,
the one with four or the one

00:46:23.572 --> 00:46:24.409
with five?
 

00:46:24.409 --> 00:46:25.659
You have to make the rule up.
 

00:46:25.659 --> 00:46:28.840
five or four?
 

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.030
Student:  Five.
 

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:31.170
Student:  Four.
 

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:32.920
Prof: Somebody said four.
 

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.590
Why?
 

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:37.170
Sophie you said four?
 

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:38.500
Student:  Less naming to
do.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.730
Prof: There'd be less
naming to do.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.768
Ah ha.
 

00:46:40.768 --> 00:46:44.838
But in fact they chose the most
substituents,

00:46:44.838 --> 00:46:47.518
and you'll see why shortly.
 

00:46:47.518 --> 00:46:50.130
Okay, so you choose the most
substituents.

00:46:50.130 --> 00:46:53.380
So you choose the one on the
top, not the one in the middle.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.139
Now why?
 

00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:55.510
Sophie's not happy with this.
 

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:56.860
But you'll see soon.
 

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.496
Now you have to number the
carbon atoms,

00:46:59.496 --> 00:47:01.929
to say where the substituents
are.

00:47:01.929 --> 00:47:03.679
Now, we can start from either
end.

00:47:03.679 --> 00:47:05.619
Right?
 

00:47:05.619 --> 00:47:07.076
If we start one,
we could go one,

00:47:07.076 --> 00:47:08.760
two, three with green and
continue;

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:09.869
or one, two,
three with red,

00:47:09.869 --> 00:47:11.309
from the other end,
and continue.

00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:14.219
Now how are we going to decide
which way to go?

00:47:14.219 --> 00:47:16.010
Kevin?
 

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:18.250
Student:  Right.
 

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:22.742
So you want in this case the Cl
and the Br to have the lowest --

00:47:22.742 --> 00:47:27.449
to be associated with the lowest
number of carbons on the chain.

00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:28.670
Prof: Okay,
there are two ways to do it.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:32.155
You could make it so the
overall sum of the numbers

00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:34.661
you're going to get --
because you'll get different

00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:36.115
numbers,
according to which end you

00:47:36.115 --> 00:47:36.650
start from.
 

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:40.362
You could sum them all up and
see which one gives the lowest

00:47:40.362 --> 00:47:44.199
sum and choose that one;
or the highest sum you could do.

00:47:44.199 --> 00:47:49.452
Or you could see which one
gives the lowest number at the

00:47:49.452 --> 00:47:50.860
first number.
 

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.889
So this, if you chose the red,
you'd have 2-chloro.

00:47:53.889 --> 00:47:57.579
If you chose the green,
you'd have 3-bromo.

00:47:57.579 --> 00:48:00.018
Right?
 

00:48:00.018 --> 00:48:01.380
And the other numbers would all
be higher.

00:48:01.380 --> 00:48:05.152
Which one do you want to do,
use the lowest sum of all the

00:48:05.152 --> 00:48:08.860
numbers, or the lowest number at
the first difference?

00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:10.340
Lucas?
 

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.019
Student:  Lowest number
at the first difference.

00:48:11.019 --> 00:48:11.670
Prof: Why?
 

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:14.034
Student:  So you can
actually build it as you go,

00:48:14.034 --> 00:48:15.755
instead of just saying --
Prof: Yeah,

00:48:15.755 --> 00:48:17.534
so you don't have to do all the
work of going through the whole

00:48:17.534 --> 00:48:18.739
thing and adding them all up and
so on.

00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:20.608
You just go 'til you get a
difference and when you get a

00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:21.389
difference that's it.
 

00:48:21.389 --> 00:48:22.590
That's much quicker.
 

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:24.059
Okay?
 

00:48:24.059 --> 00:48:26.389
So we'll go to the first
difference, lowest number at the

00:48:26.389 --> 00:48:27.179
first difference.
 

00:48:27.179 --> 00:48:30.347
And now we have to say -- now
we know we have the chain and

00:48:30.347 --> 00:48:33.461
its numbers, and now we say
where the various substituents

00:48:33.461 --> 00:48:33.900
are.
 

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:38.119
But first we have to name the
substitutents.

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:43.597
Now in the top you can see we
have methyl, bromo,

00:48:43.597 --> 00:48:46.679
methyl, ethyl and chloro.
 

00:48:46.679 --> 00:48:53.123
Now had we followed Sophie,
we would have to name that one,

00:48:53.123 --> 00:48:56.789
and that's not as easy to name.
 

00:48:56.789 --> 00:49:00.192
So the fewer substituents you
have, the harder they are to

00:49:00.192 --> 00:49:02.699
name, because they get more
complicated.

00:49:02.699 --> 00:49:04.230
Right?
 

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.242
So that's why you choose to
have the most substituents,

00:49:07.242 --> 00:49:09.250
so they'll be the easiest to
name.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.079
You have to do more but it's
easier.

00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:13.309
That particular one is called
1-chloroethyl.

00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:16.152
But why have to name
complicated things if you can

00:49:16.152 --> 00:49:17.369
name simple things?
 

00:49:17.369 --> 00:49:18.400
Okay?
 

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:21.559
So you choose the most
substituents in order to get

00:49:21.559 --> 00:49:22.570
simpler names.
 

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:24.630
Then you alphabetize them.
 

00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:28.063
You don't put them on by order
of their number,

00:49:28.063 --> 00:49:32.320
you alphabetize the names of
the groups, and you count.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:40.231
So that compound is 7-bromo- (b
is first) 2-chloro- (c)

00:49:40.231 --> 00:49:44.480
3-ethyl-6,7-dimethylnonane.
 

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:48.630
Now you might say dimethyl
should be alphabetized by

00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:50.909
d, not by m.
 

00:49:50.909 --> 00:49:52.510
But that's not the way it's
done.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:58.219
It's done by the group name and
then the prefix that tells the

00:49:58.219 --> 00:50:02.246
number doesn't enter into the
alphabetizing,

00:50:02.246 --> 00:50:06.039
usually;
although some people do it the

00:50:06.039 --> 00:50:07.018
other way.
 

00:50:07.018 --> 00:50:12.480
Okay, so that's the question
about the d.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.320
Okay.
 

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:15.445
Now, if you go to this website
you can get help with

00:50:15.445 --> 00:50:16.070
nomenclature.
 

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:17.730
Here's a compound that it goes
through.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.530
And the minute you look at this
and see the name at the bottom,

00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:24.492
the compound name,
4,5-dichloro-2,4

00:50:24.492 --> 00:50:27.280
-chloro-2-hydrox
ymethyl-5-oxo-he

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.679
xyl-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic
acid,

00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:32.239
you say "Wow!"
 

00:50:32.239 --> 00:50:36.106
And aren't you glad there are
computers that can do this for

00:50:36.106 --> 00:50:36.500
you?
 

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:42.362
But you can go through it and
figure out why they did it that

00:50:42.362 --> 00:50:42.949
way.
 

00:50:42.949 --> 00:50:46.840
But that's sort of a parlor
game.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.639
It's not fundamental chemistry.
 

00:50:48.639 --> 00:50:50.329
Okay?
 

00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:55.398
But there's some very useful
non-systematic names for simple

00:50:55.398 --> 00:50:59.179
groups: isobutane,
isopentane, neopentane.

00:50:59.179 --> 00:51:03.447
So you can have an isobutyl
group or an isopentyl group or a

00:51:03.447 --> 00:51:06.559
neopentyl group,
isopropyl, secondary-butyl,

00:51:06.559 --> 00:51:08.730
tertiary-butyl,
neopentyl.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.369
So these names you just have to
learn.

00:51:10.369 --> 00:51:11.300
Right?
 

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.409
They're not systematic.
 

00:51:12.409 --> 00:51:17.275
And there's a nomenclature
drill available on the course

00:51:17.275 --> 00:51:18.159
website.
 

00:51:18.159 --> 00:51:20.869
So it's good to know these so
we can talk to one another.

00:51:20.869 --> 00:51:23.929
But in principle the systematic
name is the way to go.

00:51:23.929 --> 00:51:27.590
Okay, that's it.
 

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:29.880
But we haven't gotten to
stereochemistry yet.

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:32.190
That'll be tomorrow, or Monday.

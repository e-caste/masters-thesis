00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.130
Prof: Let us begin,
please.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.040
Today should be a fun day for
us.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.690
We've got some visitors and
it's always --

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.003
this particular exercise is one
of the ones that I enjoy most in

00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.975
this course because we get to
talk with real performers and

00:00:14.975 --> 00:00:19.083
find out what's in their head
when they perform a concert for

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:19.700
us.
 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.360
So our aim today is to continue
along this path to make you,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.528
in this case,
educated critics so that you

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:32.087
can go to a concert of classical
music and you'll be able to

00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:35.410
engage it in a productive sort
of way--

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.310
in an educated way.
 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.598
Now there are lots of things we
could think about in terms of

00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:41.736
"do's"
and "don't's"

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:45.190
when we evaluate material
musically in a critical fashion,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.805
and we're going to be going
through some of those in section

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:48.870
starting this evening.
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.410
And we'll have a big,
long list of,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.203
"this is what you put in a
review and it's probably not so

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:54.870
good to put this in a
review."

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.856
But, generally speaking,
when you go to a concert and

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:01.438
you review it--
whether you do it just for

00:01:01.438 --> 00:01:04.242
yourself or whether you review
it and then write down your

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:06.799
thoughts and publish them as a
published review--

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.250
you do the following.
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.120
You're essentially reviewing
the performance.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.209
How well did the performance go?
 

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:16.739
How did the players do?
 

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:22.470
You're not engaging who the
composer is.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.674
You're not engaging when the
piece was written,

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:29.230
the history of the piece,
the historical context.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.944
You're not engaging
even--oddly--the meaning of the

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:35.860
piece.
 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.635
Now on our concert for Saturday
night we have three pieces:

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:42.108
one by Mozart,
one by Brahms and one by

00:01:42.108 --> 00:01:43.019
Beethoven.
 

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:46.640
What's the meaning of the
Mozart, the opening piece?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.599
Well, the meaning there is its
function, in a sense.

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:52.019
It's trying to get the concert
going.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:54.654
Originally, of course,
it was trying to get the opera

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:55.060
going.
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.516
Oddly, the music there in the
overture has nothing to do

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:01.218
specifically with the music in
the opera.

00:02:01.218 --> 00:02:03.762
There's no music in the opera
that's also used in the

00:02:03.762 --> 00:02:04.299
overture.
 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.909
But it does have a lot to do
psychologically,

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.092
because it's a very intense,
compressed overture and the

00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:13.667
opera itself--
if you begin to study that and

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.519
the way he's linking scenes and
the way he's moving his harmonic

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.258
progressions along--
it's also a very compressed,

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:20.169
intense opera.
 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:23.456
So some of the psychological
state of the opera is

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:27.415
encapsulated in that opening
overture, but that overture can

00:02:27.415 --> 00:02:29.430
open other things as well.
 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.740
So there the meaning of the
Mozart,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.449
in essence, is the function of
the piece--

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.440
to get people in,
to get them quiet,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.710
to get them focused,
and to give them a heads up,

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.292
in a way, as to the
psychological import of the

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:46.240
opera that's to follow.
 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.155
Now we have also the Beethoven,
the "Pastoral

00:02:49.155 --> 00:02:50.940
Symphony"
of Beethoven.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.789
What do you suppose the meaning
of that is?

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:54.410
Pretty straightforward.
 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.020
Anybody want to take a crack at
it?

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.146
Anybody know anything about the
"Pastoral Symphony"

00:02:58.146 --> 00:02:58.680
of Beethoven?
 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.789
What would you guess?
 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:02.979
What's it sound like?
 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:04.990
Does it sound like a train
wreck?

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.650
Does it sound like midtown
Manhattan?

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.909
Elizabeth.
 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:09.598
Student: The countryside?
 

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:11.244
Prof: Yeah,
the countryside--a kind of

00:03:11.244 --> 00:03:12.740
leisurely embrace of the
countryside--

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.719
maybe a walk through the woods
on a beautiful spring day,

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.500
that kind of thing.
 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.878
And each of the
moments--movements--

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:20.818
plays this out in a different
way--sort of an introduction,

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:23.343
then an introduction to the
birds of the forest in the

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:26.822
second movement,
a peasant romp in the third

00:03:26.822 --> 00:03:29.453
movement,
a storm gathers in the fourth

00:03:29.453 --> 00:03:30.000
movement.
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.883
That--we have an extra movement
in this particular symphony

00:03:32.883 --> 00:03:35.816
because we've got Beethoven
writing a bit of pictorial music

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:38.699
here in the form of a fourth
movement that's a storm--

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.508
and then a hymn of thanksgiving
that plays out in,

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:47.940
basically, a rondo-variation
form there at the end.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.395
So that's the meaning of
that--how an individual might

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.090
embrace the countryside.
 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.250
What's the meaning of the
Brahms?

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.578
Well, we've got these
variations and they're simply

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:03.050
sonic patterns.
 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.074
And we have patterns,
I suppose, in lots of different

00:04:07.074 --> 00:04:07.538
art.
 

00:04:07.538 --> 00:04:11.438
Think of abstract patterns in
de Kooning paintings or Jackson

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:12.090
Pollock.
 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.229
We have a beautiful Jackson
Pollock over in the Yale Art

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.620
Gallery.
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.050
Well, that's just sort of
abstraction, visual abstraction.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.420
Well, you can have sonic
abstractions as well.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.641
I was talking with our
conductor--whom we'll introduce

00:04:22.641 --> 00:04:24.829
in a moment--yesterday about
this.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.709
What's the meaning of the
Brahms--or,

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:28.620
he got to this in a different
sort of way,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.689
and maybe I won't let the cat
out of the bag with that--

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.235
but it seems to me that what
we've got here is an

00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:38.557
individual--
or an experience in which we

00:04:38.557 --> 00:04:42.069
are--we have the same frame of
reference,

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.759
the same context,
in other words the theme,

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.036
but we're going to engage it in
six or seven really different

00:04:48.036 --> 00:04:48.420
ways.
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.843
And think of all the times in
your life where you may go in to

00:04:51.843 --> 00:04:52.910
the same context.
 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:55.952
You may go into your dorm room
and you've had a terrible day

00:04:55.952 --> 00:04:58.480
and you're furious and you're
storming around,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.470
or you've had a very pleasant
day or as--

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.129
it's been a rather
revenue-neutral day in terms of

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.492
your emotional content,
so maybe it's not particularly

00:05:07.492 --> 00:05:09.379
moving one way or the other.
 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.514
You can have the same item that
you engage intellectually or

00:05:13.514 --> 00:05:16.740
psychologically in radically
different ways.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.401
So this is the same item played
out in rather radically

00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.197
different ways musically in this
theme and variation set,

00:05:24.197 --> 00:05:26.910
and we'll say more about that
later.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.889
But generally--oddly--you don't
write about these kind of things

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:31.120
when you write a review.
 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.910
What you're writing about,
again, is how well they played

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.005
the piece--
only if they play it in a way

00:05:38.005 --> 00:05:42.209
that seems to subvert the
meaning as you perceive it--

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:46.370
the meaning of the piece--is--
does the performance really

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.529
impact on the meaning of the
piece then you might say,

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:54.509
"well, this performance
was not successful because,

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.894
as I say, it countermanded or
subverted what is the meaning of

00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:02.920
this particular piece,"
as you the listener perceive

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.000
that to be.
 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.069
Oddly, also you don't talk
about the form in the pieces.

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:09.730
We've been spending all this
time on form.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.682
Form is a way of getting in
there so we can follow along

00:06:12.682 --> 00:06:15.689
intelligently what's happening
in these compositions,

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.879
but we don't write a review and
say--

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.245
in which we say,
"the orchestra started

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:22.661
out,
and we engaged the first theme

00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:25.100
and then we had a fine
transition,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.701
it went to the second theme,
and I really liked that closing

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.778
theme;
it had a lot of harmonic bang

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:31.490
to it."
 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:35.250
We don't want to sort of be led
by the nose,

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.620
if you will,
through the form of the piece,

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.639
but we'll be saying a lot more
about this in section--

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:45.213
and, as I say,
we'll have another--yet another

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:47.040
sheet to hand to you.
 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.598
It helps, when you go to a
concert, to know a little

00:06:50.598 --> 00:06:52.622
something about the composer.
 

00:06:52.622 --> 00:06:53.250
Right?
 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.730
What do you know about
Beethoven?

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.790
What do you think of when you
think of Beethoven?

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.470
 
 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.420
Yes.
 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.009
Student: The pinnacle of
all music.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.394
Prof: The pinnacle of
all music.

00:07:04.394 --> 00:07:04.870
Okay, good.
 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:06.720
That's an interesting way of
putting it,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.064
and actually even if you look
at this textbook that you're

00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:12.437
using there you've got this--
you've got an entire long

00:07:12.437 --> 00:07:15.879
chapter devoted just to
Beethoven there.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:19.064
And when people write history
books, Beethoven is kind of the

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:19.649
lynchpin.
 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.353
You work up to Beethoven and
then you work away from

00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:22.990
Beethoven.
 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.492
So Beethoven for the nineteenth
century was an icon--was the

00:07:28.492 --> 00:07:33.529
pinnacle of what the artist was
supposed to be like.

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:36.029
But it's not just the musical
artist.

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:37.940
Beethoven represented more than
that.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.819
Was he a neat and tidy guy?
 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:42.740
Was he sort of uptight guy?
 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.583
Did he wear a necktie and look
sort of constrained in the

00:07:46.583 --> 00:07:48.779
appropriate system of the day?
 

00:07:48.779 --> 00:07:50.519
I'm the ultimate corporate guy,
right?

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:52.569
Was Beethoven the ultimate
corporate guy?

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:55.550
No. What did he look like?
 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.230
He looked like the prototype of
the genius.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.764
And on the basis of how
Beethoven looked and how

00:08:01.764 --> 00:08:05.298
Beethoven acted,
people then began to build this

00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:09.209
concept of the genius in the
nineteenth century.

00:08:09.209 --> 00:08:12.637
Beethoven was the building
block for this whole idea about

00:08:12.637 --> 00:08:15.923
what a genius was--
how he was supposed to behave,

00:08:15.923 --> 00:08:20.036
how he was not necessarily to
be held to the same standards as

00:08:20.036 --> 00:08:24.420
the rest of humanity in terms of
his behavior to other people.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.600
If necessary to be dishonest,
be dishonest.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.019
He--Beethoven wasn't
necessarily dishonest.

00:08:29.019 --> 00:08:32.392
Sometimes Richard Wagner was
but it was excused because he

00:08:32.392 --> 00:08:33.279
was a genius.
 

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.123
Well, this sort of idea begins
with Beethoven here in the

00:08:36.123 --> 00:08:37.190
nineteenth century.
 

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.110
What did Beethoven write?
 

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.082
Well, as you can see on your
sheet there--everybody pick up

00:08:42.082 --> 00:08:42.750
your sheet?
 

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:47.054
I think I've got--I find it
useful to do this from time to

00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:48.839
time,
just sort of the basic

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:51.923
Beethoven, if you will,
and a list of things--if you

00:08:51.923 --> 00:08:55.907
want to buy particular pieces or
you want to explore a particular

00:08:55.907 --> 00:08:58.871
repertoire of Beethoven,
well, you can do it in this

00:08:58.871 --> 00:08:59.279
fashion.
 

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:03.888
So there is what we need to
know about Beethoven on that

00:09:03.888 --> 00:09:05.480
particular sheet.
 

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.950
Brahms we talked about.
 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.090
We talked about his pieces.
 

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.288
Mozart we will be talking a lot
more about as time goes on.

00:09:13.288 --> 00:09:17.950
Now we have--let's turn to our
big sheet here.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:19.950
What are you going to do with
this big sheet?

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:24.062
Isn't that--you could do a
couple of things with that big

00:09:24.062 --> 00:09:24.649
sheet.
 

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:32.423
An energetic student might want
to go out and go to iTunes and

00:09:32.423 --> 00:09:36.629
do what and before the concert?
 

00:09:36.629 --> 00:09:37.379
Student:
&gt;

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:40.717
Prof: Yeah,
get the pieces ahead of time

00:09:40.717 --> 00:09:44.418
for ninety-nine cents--except
with the Beethoven.

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.009
Why would the Beethoven cost
more?

00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.730
Student:
&gt;

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.140
Prof: Yeah,
you got to pay for each of the

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.643
movements.
 

00:09:49.643 --> 00:09:50.899
&gt;
 

00:09:50.899 --> 00:09:52.692
That's the way they sell the
stuff to you,

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:54.441
and, once again,
they'll call them songs.

00:09:54.441 --> 00:09:54.703
Right?
 

00:09:54.703 --> 00:09:55.597
Each of--
Student:

00:09:55.597 --> 00:09:56.250
&gt;
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:57.298
Prof: I beg your pardon.
 

00:09:57.298 --> 00:10:00.014
And you can go to the music
library because Lynda has been

00:10:00.014 --> 00:10:03.014
kind enough to put all of these
on reserve for--all these pieces

00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:04.298
on reserve for us also.
 

00:10:04.298 --> 00:10:08.501
So you have this big sheet and
you can take this--you can

00:10:08.501 --> 00:10:12.480
engage this material ahead of
time with the pieces.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.788
We don't have any of these
pieces on our CDs.

00:10:15.788 --> 00:10:18.825
There are thousands
of--zillions of classical pieces

00:10:18.825 --> 00:10:19.480
of music.
 

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.100
We can't put them all on our
CDs.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.129
We have Beethoven's--all of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony for

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:24.840
example but we don't have the
Sixth Symphony,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.678
but you can get it there on
iTunes if you want to.

00:10:27.678 --> 00:10:31.307
And then you can follow along
and ask yourself these questions

00:10:31.307 --> 00:10:34.639
as you're listening to a
recording before the concert.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:42.178
That would be a really serious
type of preparation for this.

00:10:42.178 --> 00:10:46.783
Failing that,
you could simply bring this to

00:10:46.783 --> 00:10:50.216
the concert,
and then follow along

00:10:50.216 --> 00:10:55.346
discreetly as the concert is
going on and ask yourself these

00:10:55.346 --> 00:10:58.389
questions and maybe write on it.
 

00:10:58.389 --> 00:11:01.231
It'd probably be good if we
didn't have a hundred people

00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:04.177
going like this during the
middle of the concert if we get

00:11:04.177 --> 00:11:07.072
on a change of piece or some
change in movement so try to

00:11:07.072 --> 00:11:09.321
keep the--
I've seen also students sit

00:11:09.321 --> 00:11:12.058
there with computers sort of
taking notes during --

00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:15.447
that's a bit over the top it
&gt;

00:11:15.447 --> 00:11:16.600
it seems to me.
 

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.129
So it'd be really neat
somehow--what I doâ€¦

00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:20.950
Actually, what do I do when
this is going on?

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:22.447
'Cause I have to read these
reviews.

00:11:22.447 --> 00:11:22.788
Right?
 

00:11:22.788 --> 00:11:24.325
I've got to read them,
so I've got to know,

00:11:24.325 --> 00:11:25.860
and the TAs have to know,
what happened.

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.350
What I do is I take my program
and I do have a pencil there,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:33.149
and I take my program and I'll
write little notes on my program

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:36.827
so that I can remember what the
orchestra did at a particular

00:11:36.827 --> 00:11:39.034
spot,
and generally speaking the

00:11:39.034 --> 00:11:42.779
sooner you write your review
after a performance the better.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:47.940
So do you have questions about
that?

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.375
And we'll be talking more a lot
about that in section starting

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:53.758
again this evening.
 

00:11:53.758 --> 00:11:54.850
Yes, Daniel.
 

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.629
Student: How long
&gt;

00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:58.639
Prof: How long do the
reviews be?

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:00.238
Five hundred words--two pages.
 

00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:01.409
A very good question.
 

00:12:01.409 --> 00:12:03.788
We're going to hold you to that.
 

00:12:03.788 --> 00:12:06.910
So they're not long but it
forces you to think about what's

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.710
important and what's not
important when you write.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:11.950
Roger.
 

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:22.639
Student:
&gt;

00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.946
Prof: Basically,
you're writing about how well

00:12:25.946 --> 00:12:26.899
they perform.
 

00:12:26.899 --> 00:12:30.017
At the end of it,
you could throw in a sentence

00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:34.150
or two to the effect that they
met your expectations as to the

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:38.352
meaning of this composition as
the composer intended it or they

00:12:38.352 --> 00:12:41.823
did not,
but I would not spend a lot of

00:12:41.823 --> 00:12:46.078
time engaging in the review the
meaning of the piece,

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:46.570
no.
 

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.513
So what we'll do--you've got
the five pieces here and we'll

00:12:50.513 --> 00:12:54.796
be going over some more of them
in section and getting you up to

00:12:54.796 --> 00:12:58.399
speed in terms of the repertoire
as time goes on.

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:01.610
Any other questions before we
introduce our first guest?

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.259
Yes.
 

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:06.451
Student: If we have a
comment to make on the tempo of

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:09.427
the piece--if it's too fast or
too slow, is that our own

00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:11.048
interpretation,
is that--

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:13.710
Prof: That's to be
encouraged.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.663
In other words,
if you hear this opening

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:23.490
overture going
&gt;

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.009
that's way too slow.
 

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:26.960
I'm not feeling compressed.
 

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.879
I'm not feeling excited.
 

00:13:27.879 --> 00:13:29.860
I'm not feeling energized by
that tempo.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.538
So you should say there
that--"I think the tempo

00:13:32.538 --> 00:13:33.620
was too slow."
 

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.639
Yeah.
 

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:38.840
It didn't--the music didn't
have energy;

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.890
it didn't excite the listener
because the initial tempo was

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.659
too slow.
 

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:44.990
Anything else?
 

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.460
Well, if not,
let's go on to introduce our

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.509
first guest and--Bradley Naylor.
 

00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:50.990
Here's Bradley's name up there.
 

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.009
Bradley is the--come on up,
Bradley.

00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:56.440
Bradley is the principal
conductor for tomorrow night.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.000
And we will be listening to the
Saybrook Orchestra.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.772
And the rest of our discussion
today is basically between you

00:14:03.772 --> 00:14:07.590
and Bradley with me feeding
Bradley questions.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.336
And I'm trying to think about
the kinds of things that you

00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:12.644
might want to ask,
but don't hesitate to jump

00:14:12.644 --> 00:14:15.879
right-- raise your hand and ask
Bradley a question at any point.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:18.663
So Bradley, you're a student at
the School of Music.

00:14:18.663 --> 00:14:19.100
Right?
 

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.500
Bradley Naylor:
That's right.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.710
Prof: And so tell us
about your musical training.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.379
How did you get started here?
 

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:26.129
Bradley Naylor:
I sang in choirs.

00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:29.081
Gosh, I was probably eight when
I started singing in choirs but

00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:32.080
it wasn't until middle school
that I started getting serious.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.710
My middle school music teacher
said, "Hey,

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:36.048
Brad, why don't you try out for
this regional choir thing?"

00:14:36.048 --> 00:14:38.269
And I thought well,
okay, I'll submit a tape.

00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:41.211
Then I got there and here I was
in this room of twenty-five

00:14:41.211 --> 00:14:44.408
fifteen-year-old tenors and they
were all singing the same notes

00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:46.490
at the same time and I thought
well,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:48.470
that's just a miracle.
 

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.125
And so I felt at that point I
had really found what I wanted

00:14:51.125 --> 00:14:52.839
to do--
went to high school,

00:14:52.839 --> 00:14:56.438
went to undergrad where I
majored in music just down the

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.879
road in Providence.
 

00:14:57.879 --> 00:15:00.434
And then I got a master's
degree in choral conducting at

00:15:00.434 --> 00:15:02.480
Indiana University out in the
cornfields,

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.668
and now I'm back in New England
getting an MMA,

00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:08.114
a master of musical arts,
in choral conducting at the

00:15:08.114 --> 00:15:09.428
Institute of Sacred Music.
 

00:15:09.428 --> 00:15:13.590
Prof: So your
preparation for this is a little

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:18.230
bit unusual for most conductors
because I think rarely,

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:21.591
or only exceptionally,
do you have people beginning in

00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:24.509
music through vocal music that
come around .

00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:28.336
Now you're leading an orchestra
here, so doesn't that put you at

00:15:28.336 --> 00:15:30.158
something of a disadvantage?
 

00:15:30.158 --> 00:15:32.927
I would think to be an
orchestral conductor it'd be

00:15:32.927 --> 00:15:36.359
really good to have started with
the violin or maybe the French

00:15:36.359 --> 00:15:39.404
horn so you're listening to
intonation issues and things

00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:40.288
like that.
 

00:15:40.288 --> 00:15:41.094
Bradley Naylor:
Yeah.

00:15:41.094 --> 00:15:41.870
I would agree with that.
 

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:44.513
I can't--well,
with the exception of maybe

00:15:44.513 --> 00:15:46.753
Robert Shaw,
I can't think of a single

00:15:46.753 --> 00:15:49.909
big-name conductor who started
as a choral conductor and now is

00:15:49.909 --> 00:15:52.100
in charge of a major symphony
orchestra.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.580
The vast majority of them are
either string players,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.538
keyboard players--a few wind or
brass players here and there--

00:15:57.538 --> 00:16:00.596
but I've done a few things to
try and supplement that

00:16:00.596 --> 00:16:02.360
perceived lack of knowledge.
 

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.831
When I was an undergrad I took
an orchestration class to try

00:16:05.831 --> 00:16:09.243
and get a sense of what the
capabilities and limitations of

00:16:09.243 --> 00:16:10.950
all the instruments were.
 

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.110
A couple summers ago I spent a
month at Bard College in New

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.455
York at an instrumental
conducting workshop,

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:18.798
where I worked with various
conductors.

00:16:18.798 --> 00:16:22.230
So I tried to supplement that
initial choral leaning.

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:23.669
Prof: Uh huh. Uh huh.
 

00:16:23.669 --> 00:16:25.298
But what about piano now?
 

00:16:25.298 --> 00:16:29.600
I'm always surprised how good
pianists these conductors are.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:32.883
So you must have had to
practice piano,

00:16:32.883 --> 00:16:35.140
take piano--
Bradley Naylor:

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.621
I do.
 

00:16:35.621 --> 00:16:38.827
I studied piano--I wouldn't say
extensively--but consistently

00:16:38.827 --> 00:16:41.919
throughout my young career--
Prof: Because you have

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:43.496
to--
in order to engage the

00:16:43.496 --> 00:16:45.639
music--and we'll talk about
this--

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:48.320
you have to be able to do what
with the score?

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.522
Bradley Naylor:
I think you have to be able

00:16:50.522 --> 00:16:52.230
to play--or realize--the full
score.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.750
Prof: Right,
so it might be the kind of

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.224
thing--we would put a score with
maybe twenty lines up there on

00:16:58.224 --> 00:17:01.474
the keyboard here and Bradley
would be able to read through

00:17:01.474 --> 00:17:04.500
this and digest all these twenty
lines at once,

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.880
which doesn't sound all that
difficult,

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.318
except a lot of these lines are
not actually written--

00:17:10.318 --> 00:17:13.349
the notes that are written
there are not the ones you play

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.380
because they're transposing
instruments such as the B-flat

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:19.730
clarinet and the B-flat trumpet
so it's really complicated.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.980
Bradley Naylor:
And in fact in this Brahms

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:24.792
piece there are horn parts in
E-flat, B-flat and C all at the

00:17:24.792 --> 00:17:25.450
same time.
 

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.151
Prof: That hurts.
 

00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:30.910
That would be like reading a
text in four languages.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.760
One word is in Cyrillic
alphabet and the next the Latin

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.558
alphabet and next Hebrew
alphabet so your mind has got

00:17:36.558 --> 00:17:39.200
very quickly to change all--
it's really hard.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.450
It takes years and years of
preparation.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.200
Well, what do you--what's your
goal here?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.409
What do you want to do with
this and where do you want to be

00:17:46.409 --> 00:17:47.769
fifteen years from now?
 

00:17:47.769 --> 00:17:48.965
Bradley Naylor:
Oh, gosh.

00:17:48.965 --> 00:17:51.048
Well, I don't know if there's a
white picket fence,

00:17:51.048 --> 00:17:54.509
but I would like to be teaching
at a university,

00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:57.053
directing choruses,
working on choral orchestral

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:59.867
works like maybe Haydn's
Creation or something

00:17:59.867 --> 00:18:01.741
like that,
a great piece from the same

00:18:01.741 --> 00:18:03.118
period as this Beethoven
symphony.

00:18:03.118 --> 00:18:07.046
So--working at a university or
a college level as well as maybe

00:18:07.046 --> 00:18:09.390
a professional chorus or
orchestra.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:10.210
Prof: Okay.
 

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.670
Now here is a question for you.
 

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.339
It might seem like a rude one
but I get--it's my class;

00:18:14.339 --> 00:18:15.848
I get to be rude if I want to.
 

00:18:15.848 --> 00:18:19.769
What makes you think you can do
this better than anybody else?

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:22.990
Who says that you get to be the
boss here, the leader here?

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.528
Isn't that a bit of hubris on
your part?

00:18:26.528 --> 00:18:28.894
Bradley Naylor:
I think that any conductor

00:18:28.894 --> 00:18:30.670
has a bit of hubris in him or
her.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.468
I guess the short answer to
that is that whenever I sit in a

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:39.288
rehearsal I'm using my ears--
whenever I sit in a rehearsal

00:18:39.288 --> 00:18:41.930
and I'm not conducting I'm using
my ears to try and evaluate

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:44.366
what's coming back,
and I always find myself

00:18:44.366 --> 00:18:45.538
forming an opinion.
 

00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:47.318
This could be louder;
this could be softer;

00:18:47.318 --> 00:18:49.390
I want to hear that more than I
want to hear this other thing.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.494
So the only place you can
achieve that goal is if you're

00:18:52.494 --> 00:18:54.019
in front of the ensemble.
 

00:18:54.019 --> 00:18:54.563
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:18:54.563 --> 00:18:55.923
Oddly, that's what they will be
doing, though,

00:18:55.923 --> 00:18:56.890
when they go to this concert.
 

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.213
You guys will be listening and
saying, "Gee,

00:18:59.213 --> 00:19:01.490
I--why didn't--I loved that
flute line there.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.680
Why wasn't that flute line
louder?"

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.154
So he's kind of a critic,
but he wants to apply his

00:19:07.154 --> 00:19:10.910
critical facility here to
interpretation so that's--

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:16.250
to impose his concept of the
music on others for the benefit

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.261
of others, I--
Bradley Naylor:

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:19.680
And the next week one of
you can conduct it so--

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.086
Prof: Well,
what do they have to have to

00:19:22.086 --> 00:19:22.608
conduct?
 

00:19:22.608 --> 00:19:25.890
What's it take to be a good
conductor, do you think?

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.440
Just that you've got good
insights in to the music?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.375
Well, I have I think just as
good of insights in to the music

00:19:33.375 --> 00:19:35.520
as you do,
Bradley, but I don't think I

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.150
would be any good as a conductor
and I kind of know why.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:40.814
So what do you have to do,
what do you have to have,

00:19:40.814 --> 00:19:42.118
to be a good conductor?
 

00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:46.368
Bradley Naylor:
I think it's a varied skill

00:19:46.368 --> 00:19:46.890
set.
 

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.154
I think--and don't tell my
colleagues I'm saying this--but

00:19:50.154 --> 00:19:53.074
I think at its basis,
the conductor is really just a

00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:55.480
glorified traffic cop in certain
ways.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.038
Prof: Traffic cop?
 

00:19:56.038 --> 00:19:57.196
Bradley Naylor:
You have to make sure that

00:19:57.196 --> 00:19:57.798
there are no accidents.
 

00:19:57.798 --> 00:19:59.890
You don't want the oboes to
crash into the bassoons;

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:00.890
nobody wants that.
 

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.200
You have to make sure that
people yield when they need to.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:07.269
If you need to hear the viola
line, you've got to have the

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:07.848
violins yield.
 

00:20:07.848 --> 00:20:11.539
And you just have to make sure
that everyone gets to their

00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:15.619
locations without incident and
in as fluid a way as possible.

00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:16.960
Prof: Yeah. Okay. Good.
 

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.828
Now here's another component of
this, though.

00:20:20.828 --> 00:20:23.471
I've heard of people talking
about it in the terms,

00:20:23.471 --> 00:20:26.482
"Well, I have absolute
rhythmic-- sort of an absolute

00:20:26.482 --> 00:20:27.538
sense of rhythm.
 

00:20:27.538 --> 00:20:30.078
I can tell what a particular
pulse is.

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:32.732
I can identify that for you,
and I can keep that,

00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:36.160
and that's why I'm interested
in becoming a conductor."

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.976
Or let's say you're conducting,
and this is where I would

00:20:38.976 --> 00:20:40.757
always--
I have done some conducting,

00:20:40.757 --> 00:20:42.808
used to conduct the Collegium
here at Yale,

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:46.096
but where I got in trouble was
when something was out of tune I

00:20:46.096 --> 00:20:49.275
could hear "Hey,
that doesn't sound good,"

00:20:49.275 --> 00:20:53.538
but I couldn't tell 'em why,
or what to do to make it sound

00:20:53.538 --> 00:20:54.089
right.
 

00:20:54.089 --> 00:20:55.960
My ear wasn't good enough.
 

00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.500
So how good an ear do you have
to be to be a conductor?

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.640
How good of an ear do you have
to have?

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.256
Bradley Naylor:
I think you have an ear not

00:21:06.256 --> 00:21:07.867
just for pitch--
particularly with an

00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:11.294
orchestra--but also for timbre,
which is the property that

00:21:11.294 --> 00:21:15.118
distinguishes maybe an oboe
sound from a clarinet sound.

00:21:15.118 --> 00:21:19.441
Of course, if you're playing a
piano, then &lt;&lt;plays

00:21:19.441 --> 00:21:20.618
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:21:20.618 --> 00:21:23.115
you can't change the timbre of
a single piano note but if

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.565
you're playing it on a clarinet
it's going to sound very

00:21:25.565 --> 00:21:27.660
different than if you play it on
a trumpet.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.500
So you have to be able to
balance timbres.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:32.563
And I think before the downbeat
of the first rehearsal a

00:21:32.563 --> 00:21:36.127
conductor really has to have the
sound of the piece in his or her

00:21:36.127 --> 00:21:39.325
ear,
so I know what needs to be

00:21:39.325 --> 00:21:40.568
pulled out.
 

00:21:40.568 --> 00:21:43.132
Maybe the third clarinet is a
little bit sharp so I say,

00:21:43.132 --> 00:21:45.275
"Third clarinet,
your B-flat--make sure it

00:21:45.275 --> 00:21:46.720
doesn't sit too high."
 

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.630
So I think you have to have the
piece in your head.

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:51.816
There's an old conductor's
mantra: "Always have the

00:21:51.816 --> 00:21:54.001
score in your head and not your
head in the score,"

00:21:54.001 --> 00:21:55.134
so--
Prof: Well,

00:21:55.134 --> 00:21:55.348
okay.
 

00:21:55.348 --> 00:21:57.930
There are all kinds of things I
could ask you about there.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.038
What are you going to do?
 

00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:00.970
Now you're the principal
conductor.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.390
You're doing two of the three
pieces.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:03.750
You're doing the first half.
 

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:08.193
You're doing the Mozart and the
Brahms and then Lauren Quigley

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:09.358
will come out.
 

00:22:09.358 --> 00:22:11.685
She couldn't be with us today,
but Lauren Quigley will come

00:22:11.685 --> 00:22:12.848
out and lead the Beethoven.
 

00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:16.759
Are you going to try to conduct
any of this without a score and

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:19.028
what advantages and
disadvantage--

00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:21.487
sometimes you go to concerts
and a reviewer might notice

00:22:21.487 --> 00:22:21.798
that.
 

00:22:21.798 --> 00:22:24.263
Generally speaking,
if you see a conductor

00:22:24.263 --> 00:22:27.509
conducting without a score,
what does that indicate?

00:22:27.509 --> 00:22:29.491
Bradley Naylor:
Well, I think it's always

00:22:29.491 --> 00:22:32.066
impressive to the ensemble when
a conductor is able to conduct

00:22:32.066 --> 00:22:32.910
without a score.
 

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:35.278
Last year Helmuth Rilling,
who is a famous German

00:22:35.278 --> 00:22:37.224
conductor,
came and worked with some of

00:22:37.224 --> 00:22:39.650
the ensembles and did
Mendelssohn's Elijah,

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:42.106
which is a huge romantic
oratorio about two and a half

00:22:42.106 --> 00:22:42.710
hours long.
 

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.019
The dress rehearsal--He came to
the dress rehearsal,

00:22:45.019 --> 00:22:47.019
put his score down on the music
stand,

00:22:47.019 --> 00:22:49.460
conducted for three hours,
never opened it,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:52.920
and we were like, "Wow,
this guy knows the score."

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.527
So my task is to try to get
four and half minutes of Mozart

00:22:56.527 --> 00:22:59.700
in to my head so I don't have to
open that score.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.519
We'll see tomorrow if I am able
to do it--but that's my goal.

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.326
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:07.105
So that sort of talent and sort
of that's a kind of combination

00:23:07.105 --> 00:23:09.568
of a photographic memory and a
phonographic memory,

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:11.009
that you've got to--you've got
locked in there.

00:23:11.009 --> 00:23:13.598
You can hear something just
once and it's locked in there.

00:23:13.598 --> 00:23:15.430
That's the kind of thing Mozart
could do,

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.880
and we'll talk more about that
later on,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.499
and--but so your orchestra will
respect you more if you've got

00:23:22.499 --> 00:23:24.088
this all memorized.
 

00:23:24.088 --> 00:23:27.182
What does it sort of free you
up to do then obviously if

00:23:27.182 --> 00:23:30.048
you've got- if you're conducting
without a score?

00:23:30.048 --> 00:23:33.037
Bradley Naylor:
Well, I think at its

00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:35.369
essence,
conducting is communicating to

00:23:35.369 --> 00:23:38.457
the people in front of you,
and anything that you can get

00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:41.740
out of the way between you and
the people who are playing the

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:43.108
music is an advantage.
 

00:23:43.108 --> 00:23:44.970
So I think getting the music
stand out of the way,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.965
getting the score out of the
way, making sure that at all

00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:48.962
times you can actually see the
people who are making this

00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:49.318
music.
 

00:23:49.318 --> 00:23:52.109
I think anything you can do to
do that is an advantage.

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:53.519
Prof: Yeah. Great.
 

00:23:53.519 --> 00:23:55.338
I want to go back to this
question, though,

00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:57.160
of ear because I think it's so
critical.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.932
You were talking about the
third clarinet and "don't

00:23:58.932 --> 00:23:59.660
play too sharp."
 

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.028
Well, once again I'd be sitting
there--"who's playing what

00:24:04.028 --> 00:24:05.509
that's wrong?"
 

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:08.717
And I'm wondering are--is it
the oboe maybe--instead of the

00:24:08.717 --> 00:24:10.930
clarinet being sharp,
the oboe's flat.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.930
All I hear is a problem.
 

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.656
I don't know what--where the
problem is so--but--and so you

00:24:16.656 --> 00:24:19.868
would have to have a pretty keen
sense of pitch.

00:24:19.868 --> 00:24:21.930
Do you have what we call
absolute pitch?

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.363
Bradley Naylor:
I don't have absolute

00:24:23.363 --> 00:24:23.630
pitch.
 

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.700
I have pretty good relative
pitch.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.296
Prof: Okay.
 

00:24:27.296 --> 00:24:32.086
So I enjoy playing this
particular game with musicians,

00:24:32.086 --> 00:24:36.346
and people generally,
where we do an ear training

00:24:36.346 --> 00:24:40.250
drill, and I need somebody--is
it Mike?

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.923
I just need somebody to come up
and play the piano,

00:24:42.923 --> 00:24:44.848
just bang some notes on the
piano.

00:24:44.848 --> 00:24:47.664
Who--Daniel,
you know your way around a

00:24:47.664 --> 00:24:48.480
keyboard.
 

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:55.722
You're a guitar player,
so anybody play--the gentleman

00:24:55.722 --> 00:24:56.680
here.
 

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.730
Come on up.
 

00:24:57.730 --> 00:24:59.557
Yeah. Okay. Come on up--
Bradley Naylor:

00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:00.250
So I'll be where I can't
see the keys--

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.532
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:25:01.532 --> 00:25:05.740
So we're going to be over here
and Adam, come play this game

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.663
also, and Lynda,
do you want to play this,

00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:11.160
down you go in terms of pitch?
 

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.009
Your name is--
Student:  Rahul.

00:25:13.009 --> 00:25:14.952
Prof: Rahul.
 

00:25:14.952 --> 00:25:18.838
So--and Jacob,
come on out here also.

00:25:18.838 --> 00:25:22.558
Play--start around middle C and
we'll see if anybody can

00:25:22.558 --> 00:25:25.940
identify any--and Lynda,
you don't want to play?

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.588
I'd like to have some ladies up
here too.

00:25:28.588 --> 00:25:32.250
Santana, you come on up and
play the name that pitch game.

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:36.549
And we'll talk about absolute
pitch and we'll talk about

00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:37.880
relative pitch.
 

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.609
So play a note and we'll see
how we do.

00:25:40.609 --> 00:25:42.420
&gt;
 

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.289
Prof: Oh.
 

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:45.358
That's up.
 

00:25:45.358 --> 00:25:47.049
Well, can we play a note that's
a little lower?

00:25:47.049 --> 00:25:49.670
&gt;
 

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.519
Okay.
 

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:56.660
 
 

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.259
Does anyone think they know
what the note is?

00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:02.058
But don't--how--anybody up here
think they know what it is?

00:26:02.058 --> 00:26:06.400
Student: I would guess
but &gt;

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.280
Prof: Bradley,
do you think you know what it

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:08.470
is?
 

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.912
Bradley Naylor:
Yeah, but I have two

00:26:09.912 --> 00:26:11.868
guesses and whichever one I say
it's going to be wrong.

00:26:11.868 --> 00:26:13.630
I think it's either G or
G-sharp.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:16.210
Prof: Well,
what do you guys think?

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.009
Student: I would've said
A-flat.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:18.730
Prof: Okay. Okay.
 

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.920
You notice how cagey I am here.
 

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.150
I haven't committed.
 

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:23.460
Yeah.
 

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:27.190
That--but just at the outset he
played that initial pitch and

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.619
then what did he do?
 

00:26:28.619 --> 00:26:31.259
He dropped it down an octave.
 

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:31.549
Okay?
 

00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:34.750
So we think that that's--that
probably is an A-flat or a

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.390
G-sharp.
 

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:36.380
Is that correct?
 

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:36.828
Student: Yeah.
 

00:26:36.828 --> 00:26:38.096
Prof: Okay.
 

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:40.769
Now knowing that,
play another pitch.

00:26:40.769 --> 00:26:44.289
Go ahead, Rob.
 

00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:49.259
&gt;
 

00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:51.069
Anybody know what that is?
 

00:26:51.069 --> 00:26:55.670
&gt;
 

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.308
So then the question is why is
this guy teaching this course?

00:26:59.308 --> 00:26:59.825
&gt;
 

00:26:59.825 --> 00:26:59.953
Right?
 

00:26:59.953 --> 00:27:00.470
&gt;
 

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.240
Why is he in this profession to
begin with?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.117
Because he's wrestled with this
issue all his life and said,

00:27:06.117 --> 00:27:06.849
"Why me?
 

00:27:06.849 --> 00:27:08.200
Why can't I do this?"
 

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.180
and tried to figure it out,
tried to use other tricks to

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:14.155
get around this,
to overcome this handicap and

00:27:14.155 --> 00:27:18.183
to hang around with musicians
and sort of explain things that

00:27:18.183 --> 00:27:20.116
they do,
that they take in sort of

00:27:20.116 --> 00:27:23.250
quickly and intuitively,
and break them down and explain

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.210
what it is that they're doing.
 

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.904
So at this point Bradley seems
not to be having trouble with

00:27:28.904 --> 00:27:29.720
that pitch.
 

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.279
I don't know what it is --I
could--G.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:35.450
Yeah. All right. All right.
 

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.099
So I'm out, down I go,
but what was that pitch?

00:27:39.099 --> 00:27:39.930
Bradley Naylor: C-sharp.
 

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.869
Prof: C-sharp.
 

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:42.868
Okay.
 

00:27:42.868 --> 00:27:43.512
All right.
 

00:27:43.512 --> 00:27:46.538
So let's see--now knowing that
that's a C-sharp,

00:27:46.538 --> 00:27:50.336
let's see how--let's go--we'll
go a little faster here so we

00:27:50.336 --> 00:27:53.039
don't take up too much-- Another
key.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.490
Who knows that?
 

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.410
Bradley?
 

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.788
Jacob?
 

00:27:58.788 --> 00:28:01.190
We should have him write it on
there.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.200
Who doesn't know what it is?
 

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.390
Santana?
 

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.099
Student: Play it again.
 

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:05.880
&gt;
 

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.380
 
 

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.430
Prof: Anybody know?
 

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:14.589
What do you think it is?
 

00:28:14.589 --> 00:28:15.048
Student: G.
 

00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:15.880
Prof: What do you think
it is?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.108
Student: I'll go with G.
 

00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:17.772
Prof: Okay.
 

00:28:17.772 --> 00:28:18.656
&gt;
 

00:28:18.656 --> 00:28:19.099
All right.
 

00:28:19.099 --> 00:28:21.798
So--but what was it? Was it a G?
 

00:28:21.798 --> 00:28:22.076
Okay.
 

00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:25.287
So it seems to me that actually
Bradley seems to be winning

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:25.730
here.
 

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.118
He--this is interesting.
 

00:28:28.118 --> 00:28:31.730
So maybe there is a reason that
he's the conductor here.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:32.970
The rest--I'm out.
 

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:35.987
The rest of us are--they're
kind of negotiating with each

00:28:35.987 --> 00:28:39.327
other and maybe pegging off of
what Bradley was saying there so

00:28:39.327 --> 00:28:41.328
we'll stop this but--
Bradley Naylor:

00:28:41.328 --> 00:28:42.730
Well, and maybe I can just
add the--

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.130
Prof: Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
 

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:44.969
Bradley Naylor:
For a person that doesn't

00:28:44.969 --> 00:28:49.038
have absolute pitch like myself,
whenever I do hear a note I

00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:52.314
think, "Well,
what song does that

00:28:52.314 --> 00:28:56.338
start," or is there a chord
or a sonority with which I'm

00:28:56.338 --> 00:28:57.950
familiar that I know.
 

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.708
For instance,
so--do you mind if I just do a

00:28:59.708 --> 00:29:00.690
little bit of playing?
 

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.318
Prof: Sure.
 

00:29:01.318 --> 00:29:04.076
Bradley Naylor:
So for instance that first

00:29:04.076 --> 00:29:06.028
note &gt;
 

00:29:06.028 --> 00:29:11.203
was a G-sharp so I know that
the first aria in Handel's

00:29:11.203 --> 00:29:15.420
Messiah &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.028
starts with a &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:17.028 --> 00:29:17.932
&gt;
 

00:29:17.932 --> 00:29:19.916
G-sharp in the melody and I
kind of know how that sounds

00:29:19.916 --> 00:29:21.000
&gt;
 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.240
and that's how I figured that
was a G-sharp.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.000
The second note he played
&gt;

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.259
was a C-sharp or a D-flat.
 

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:29.630
And there is this great
Fauré piece &lt;&lt;plays

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:30.548
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:29:30.548 --> 00:29:33.108
that starts &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:33.108 --> 00:29:36.376
with this great D-flat so I
kind of find a piece that I can

00:29:36.376 --> 00:29:37.108
latch onto.
 

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.848
Prof: That's very
interesting.

00:29:38.848 --> 00:29:42.270
In all the years I've been
doing that, I haven't heard that

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:44.160
particular explanation for it.
 

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.395
Most people that have absolute
pitch, "boom,"

00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:47.680
they hear it instantaneously.
 

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:50.654
There is someone in this room
also who has absolute pitch,

00:29:50.654 --> 00:29:52.430
but I don't want to go in to
it.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.622
Instances of absolute pitch are
about one in ten thousand,

00:29:56.622 --> 00:29:59.269
sort of instantaneous
recognition.

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:01.118
He's getting that but in a
different way.

00:30:01.118 --> 00:30:04.907
He must have some kind of
absolute recollection of

00:30:04.907 --> 00:30:09.237
particular pieces that are
intentionally impressed on his

00:30:09.237 --> 00:30:13.490
oral memory somehow and he then
plays off of those.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:15.432
That--that's an interesting way
of doing it, but,

00:30:15.432 --> 00:30:17.858
as I say, it's not something
that I've encountered before.

00:30:17.858 --> 00:30:18.134
Okay.
 

00:30:18.134 --> 00:30:20.670
Well, and so that's kind of
important though.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.298
You got to have a good ear like
that to be able to tell these

00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:23.440
people "you're sharp"
or flat.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.884
Now let's say you're in the
middle of things and something

00:30:26.884 --> 00:30:27.670
goes wrong.
 

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:31.547
You have a sense that your--you
know that your clarinet is a

00:30:31.547 --> 00:30:32.730
little bit flat.
 

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:36.844
What--well, you can't just hold
up a sign or an arrow going like

00:30:36.844 --> 00:30:37.890
this, can you?
 

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:38.910
Maybe you can.
 

00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:41.596
How do you get,
in real time--as the piece that

00:30:41.596 --> 00:30:44.400
you're conducting and the piece
is unfolding,

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.116
how do you get somebody to
correct something in terms of

00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:47.759
intonation?
 

00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:49.277
Bradley Naylor:
I think that there is a

00:30:49.277 --> 00:30:51.300
difference between what you do
in a rehearsal and what you do

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.009
in a performance.
 

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:53.717
In a rehearsal,
you'd say, "Hold up

00:30:53.717 --> 00:30:54.328
there."
 

00:30:54.328 --> 00:30:56.049
The grand pause and say,
"Clarinet there,

00:30:56.049 --> 00:30:56.700
fix that."
 

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.347
In a performance,
you hope that you have

00:30:59.347 --> 00:31:03.421
inculcated in your performers a
sense of pitch and a sense of

00:31:03.421 --> 00:31:06.068
what their function is in a
chord,

00:31:06.068 --> 00:31:09.269
so that if something's going
wrong you just look at them and

00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:10.484
say,
"Yes, you know you're

00:31:10.484 --> 00:31:10.710
wrong.
 

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:13.618
Fix it,"
'cause you can't stop.

00:31:13.618 --> 00:31:15.882
The traffic cop--if you don't
look at the Subaru over here

00:31:15.882 --> 00:31:18.223
he's going to crash in to a tree
so you have to take care of

00:31:18.223 --> 00:31:20.361
everybody--
but the guy who's running the

00:31:20.361 --> 00:31:21.816
stop sign,
you have to take care of that

00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:22.210
person first.
 

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.872
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:23.872 --> 00:31:26.088
So let me ask you this.
 

00:31:26.088 --> 00:31:29.317
Oftentimes you go to a concert,
particularly non-professional

00:31:29.317 --> 00:31:29.910
concerts.
 

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.930
At the end of a movement they
will stop and tune.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:38.240
If we hear in the Beethoven the
tuning between movements,

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.978
is that a sign that the
intonation of the previous

00:31:40.978 --> 00:31:43.548
movement wasn't all that it
might have been?

00:31:43.548 --> 00:31:46.428
Bradley Naylor:
I think it's a bigger

00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:50.176
problem with early instruments
that are a little bit more

00:31:50.176 --> 00:31:53.020
temperamental,
but certainly if we stop in the

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.353
middle and you hear Gabriel
Ellsworth give us a

00:31:55.353 --> 00:31:56.568
&gt;
 

00:31:56.568 --> 00:31:58.298
and we retune,
then yes &lt;&lt;plays

00:31:58.298 --> 00:31:59.019
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:02.721
so that would be--
Prof: He really does

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:03.742
have--
Bradley Naylor:

00:32:03.742 --> 00:32:05.621
I was just hearing the
G-sharp from earlier and

00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:06.380
it's a half step up.
 

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.719
No problem.
 

00:32:07.719 --> 00:32:10.519
&gt;
 

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:12.141
Prof: Okay.
 

00:32:12.141 --> 00:32:17.184
So there are some things that
you can do in real time and

00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:22.858
things that you just hope that
you've prepared for properly.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:26.017
But keep an eye on
that--whether they actually tune

00:32:26.017 --> 00:32:27.278
between movements.
 

00:32:27.278 --> 00:32:29.519
Now I think we have some other
folks that are going to

00:32:29.519 --> 00:32:30.828
demonstrate some things here.
 

00:32:30.828 --> 00:32:34.075
I think we have Katie Dryden,
a viola player or,

00:32:34.075 --> 00:32:35.180
the principal.
 

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.406
Okay, Katie,
come on up, and I don't know if

00:32:37.406 --> 00:32:38.910
Elana Kagan is here or not.
 

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.170
Is she here--flutist?
 

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:41.049
Student: I haven't seen
her--

00:32:41.049 --> 00:32:43.710
Prof: Oh, my. Oh, my.
 

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:44.730
Maybe she's sleeping in.
 

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.063
Oh, too bad. We'll say that--
Bradley Naylor:

00:32:47.063 --> 00:32:47.650
I doubt it,
knowing her.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:48.670
Prof: What?
 

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:49.588
Bradley Naylor:
I don't think she slept in.

00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:50.038
&gt;
 

00:32:50.038 --> 00:32:52.761
Prof: I guess it's
only--maybe it's only five

00:32:52.761 --> 00:32:53.190
after.
 

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:56.450
So we do have-- Let's talk
about the Mozart.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:58.529
We've got this opening piece.
 

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:01.713
First of all,
which piece of the two

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:03.990
frightens you the most?
 

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:04.920
You're the conductor.
 

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:05.990
What are you worried about?
 

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.950
What scares you when you step
out there?

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:09.900
Bradley Naylor: Uh huh.
 

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.390
Well, what's easy about the
Mozart?

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.269
Okay. No tempo changes.
 

00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:17.088
Fine, so the whole piece is in
this--in the same tempo.

00:33:17.088 --> 00:33:19.678
Problem: If you don't set the
right tempo, you're screwed for

00:33:19.678 --> 00:33:20.798
four and a half minutes.
 

00:33:20.798 --> 00:33:25.259
So what I do--
&gt;

00:33:25.259 --> 00:33:28.240
I have to get that dead on so
that the whole ensemble knows

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.680
exactly what the tempo is.
 

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.653
Prof: Well,
okay.

00:33:30.653 --> 00:33:33.279
Then, well, say you mess it up
in the first couple of beats.

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.740
Can't you correct it?
 

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.750
Bradley Naylor:
I think a good critic,

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.213
as you will all be,
would say, "Well,

00:33:39.213 --> 00:33:40.680
this is classical music,
Mr. Naylor,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.960
and there's nothing in the
score that says rit or

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:45.448
accelerando so actually
you should keep whatever tempo

00:33:45.448 --> 00:33:47.190
is established at the
beginning."

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:48.029
Prof: Okay. Yeah.
 

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:51.964
So you're not tempted to get
out there and go "one,

00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:53.968
two, one, two,
one two,"

00:33:53.968 --> 00:33:54.970
like that.
 

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.457
And I'm always impressed when
conductors they come out and

00:33:57.457 --> 00:33:59.640
they kind of look at the
orchestra and they go--

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.644
and they just start without
much in the way of preliminary

00:34:02.644 --> 00:34:04.557
beats,
but that's kind of risky,

00:34:04.557 --> 00:34:07.358
isn't it,
and really dangerous? And--

00:34:07.358 --> 00:34:09.561
Bradley Naylor:
But I--one of my conducting

00:34:09.561 --> 00:34:11.534
teachers told me,
you know, there's no part in

00:34:11.534 --> 00:34:13.260
the score that's labeled
"conductor"

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.485
so you shouldn't do anything
other than what's going to get

00:34:15.485 --> 00:34:17.018
the people in front of you to
play.

00:34:17.018 --> 00:34:19.166
So there's no point in at the
beginning going "One,

00:34:19.166 --> 00:34:21.000
two, three, four,"
&gt;

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.447
because then you have a
conductor solo for two bars and

00:34:24.447 --> 00:34:28.449
it's not in the score so--
Prof: So let's see.

00:34:28.449 --> 00:34:30.469
Katie, come on up and do we
have a stand for you?

00:34:30.469 --> 00:34:33.893
Did we not--well,
I'm sure we got one inside here

00:34:33.893 --> 00:34:34.750
somewhere.
 

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:37.579
Lynda, maybe our-- Oh, no, no.
 

00:34:37.579 --> 00:34:39.500
Oh, you brought one? Okay.
 

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.061
Well, get your stand out
because we've got the beginning

00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:46.690
of the overture to The
Marriage of Figaro here.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:50.563
Shall we play a CD of it or
maybe we could--let's talk about

00:34:50.563 --> 00:34:52.599
Lynda while--I tell you what.
 

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:55.869
While Katie's getting her stand
let's talk about Lynda.

00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:57.869
She's got a bassoon part here.
 

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:01.182
What happens at the beginning
of this, Bradley,

00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:04.568
in terms of the texture:
monophonic, homophonic,

00:35:04.568 --> 00:35:05.650
polyphonic?
 

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.969
Bradley Naylor:
It's monophonic.

00:35:06.969 --> 00:35:07.929
Prof: Why?
 

00:35:07.929 --> 00:35:09.512
Bradley Naylor:
Because all of the

00:35:09.512 --> 00:35:11.768
instrument--there are many
instruments playing but they're

00:35:11.768 --> 00:35:13.630
all playing the same line at the
same time.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.324
Prof: Okay.
 

00:35:14.324 --> 00:35:15.909
So--but isn't that a little bit
awkward?

00:35:15.909 --> 00:35:18.695
Because some of these
instruments sort of speak a lot

00:35:18.695 --> 00:35:20.409
faster than other instruments.
 

00:35:20.409 --> 00:35:23.079
Fast--what would the
fast-speaking instruments,

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:26.039
that could play very
agilely--what would they be?

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:27.413
Bradley Naylor:
I think the violins

00:35:27.413 --> 00:35:28.820
probably have the easiest time
of this,

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.163
whereas the celli and the
bassoon probably have the

00:35:31.163 --> 00:35:33.789
toughest time with this 'cause
it takes lower instruments

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:36.179
longer for them to speak and
make their sounds.

00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:37.635
Prof: Uh huh.
 

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:41.784
So the cellos and basses and
the low part of the woodwinds

00:35:41.784 --> 00:35:44.768
that might have a difficult time
here.

00:35:44.768 --> 00:35:48.525
So we--Lynda has been good
enough to be a sacrificial lamb

00:35:48.525 --> 00:35:51.030
for today and bring in her
bassoon,

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.150
and she sent me an e-mail last
night saying,

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:54.478
"Oh, disaster.
 

00:35:54.478 --> 00:35:58.601
I cracked my only good reed and
I'm not going to bring in--I

00:35:58.601 --> 00:36:01.550
can't bring in my bassoon;
it just won't work."

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:02.603
So I said, "Come on.
 

00:36:02.603 --> 00:36:03.909
We're really counting on this.
 

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:05.059
Please bring in your
bassoon."

00:36:05.059 --> 00:36:11.465
So here is Lynda with a broken
reed and--hi.

00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:13.849
Are you Elana?
 

00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:14.630
Student: Yes, I am.
 

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.539
Prof: Okay.
 

00:36:15.539 --> 00:36:16.096
Come on up.
 

00:36:16.096 --> 00:36:16.449
Good.
 

00:36:16.449 --> 00:36:21.625
So just come on up and take out
your flute and we'll get out the

00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:24.090
music here in just a second.
 

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:27.820
So let's--can we have the
beginning of the Figaro?

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.559
Do you want to conduct this or
no?

00:36:29.559 --> 00:36:30.489
Bradley Naylor:
Oh, heavens.

00:36:30.489 --> 00:36:31.530
This is chamber music at this
point.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.159
Prof: I see. Okay.
 

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:34.393
Bradley Naylor:
How about I give you a

00:36:34.393 --> 00:36:35.429
tempo and then you guys go to
town?

00:36:35.429 --> 00:36:36.900
Okay?
 

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.554
I'll give--
Prof: And again I thank

00:36:40.554 --> 00:36:44.800
Lynda for doing this because
it's not an ideal situation.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.559
&gt;
 

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:47.911
Bradley Naylor:
All right.

00:36:47.911 --> 00:36:50.922
So here's a safe conservative
tempo, about

00:36:50.922 --> 00:36:52.760
&gt;
 

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.389
that fast.
 

00:36:54.389 --> 00:36:55.829
One, two.
 

00:36:55.829 --> 00:37:00.909
&gt;
 

00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:06.550
&gt;
 

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:08.840
Yeah.
 

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.889
Cool.
 

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:17.039
&gt;
 

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:18.969
Prof: Wonderful. Bravo.
 

00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:22.190
&gt;
 

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.494
Yeah.
 

00:37:22.494 --> 00:37:24.929
This is great,
the Music 112 orchestra.

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:27.255
Now you said,
"Well, here's a

00:37:27.255 --> 00:37:29.510
conservative safe tempo."
 

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:31.190
Bradley Naylor:
Yeah, that's a safe--

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.757
Prof: Well,
what happens if you don't take

00:37:33.757 --> 00:37:34.559
a safe tempo?
 

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:37.768
What kind of disasters might
befall us?

00:37:37.768 --> 00:37:40.206
Bradley Naylor:
Well, I think in this case

00:37:40.206 --> 00:37:41.780
there wouldn't be a disaster.
 

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:45.239
It just wouldn't go as fast as
I had set up so I have a

00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:48.954
recording of I think it's James
Levine and the Metropolitan

00:37:48.954 --> 00:37:51.554
Opera Orchestra--
the highest paid orchestra in

00:37:51.554 --> 00:37:53.068
the country--
and they take this at a

00:37:53.068 --> 00:37:58.880
blistering tempo,
&gt;

00:37:58.880 --> 00:37:59.929
really fast.
 

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:01.809
Now we'll see how close we can
get.

00:38:01.809 --> 00:38:04.130
No. &gt;
 

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:05.360
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.597
How fast you can take something
sometimes is conditioned by the

00:38:09.597 --> 00:38:12.469
acoustical environment that
you're in,

00:38:12.469 --> 00:38:15.976
and maybe we'll come back to
that, about the acoustics of

00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:17.980
Battell a little bit later on.
 

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:22.039
Now let's see.
 

00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:27.219
Katie, you're a violist and
you're the principal violist,

00:38:27.219 --> 00:38:31.181
and I wanted to ask you--your
job is to kind of ride roughshod

00:38:31.181 --> 00:38:34.949
over the rest of the violas here
and how do you do that?

00:38:34.949 --> 00:38:37.599
Isn't that like herding
rattlesnakes or something like

00:38:37.599 --> 00:38:37.949
that?
 

00:38:37.949 --> 00:38:41.307
Supposing you want to get your
section to be really precise and

00:38:41.307 --> 00:38:44.557
really exact and all those bows
going up and down at the same

00:38:44.557 --> 00:38:46.867
time,
the articulation exactly the

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:48.130
way they should be.
 

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.952
How do you go--you lead by
example, but in the actual

00:38:51.952 --> 00:38:56.141
performance how do you keep
your--the rest of those violas

00:38:56.141 --> 00:38:58.199
with you, the principal?
 

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:00.465
Katie Dryden:
Well, you have to be very

00:39:00.465 --> 00:39:03.284
confident about what you are
playing and you can't change

00:39:03.284 --> 00:39:03.989
your mind.
 

00:39:03.989 --> 00:39:06.920
So you need to know what--when
you need to come in,

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.653
what you need to be playing,
which direction your bow is

00:39:08.653 --> 00:39:11.373
moving,
and show that when you're

00:39:11.373 --> 00:39:12.239
playing.
 

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:15.137
It's not by exaggerating,
but just by being confident and

00:39:15.137 --> 00:39:18.242
so then the rest of the people
know their parts very well but

00:39:18.242 --> 00:39:20.746
will--
and follow off and will have

00:39:20.746 --> 00:39:24.079
that little bit of assurance
when you come in.

00:39:24.079 --> 00:39:24.856
Prof: Great.
 

00:39:24.856 --> 00:39:27.150
How do you know that they know
their parts really well?

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.090
What would you imagine might be
a tipoff?

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:31.489
And you're at a concert and
you're watching,

00:39:31.489 --> 00:39:33.110
looking at what's going on.
 

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.400
What would be a tipoff that
maybe they don't know their

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.250
parts really well?
 

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:41.829
They're sitting there with
their nose in the music rather

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:44.820
than watching the conductor.
 

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:47.460
The more the orchestra is
watching the conductor for the

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:50.224
cues and the interpretation,
the more that says hey,

00:39:50.224 --> 00:39:53.659
they've really got this almost
committed to memory and they can

00:39:53.659 --> 00:39:55.972
get in--
they can get beyond the notes

00:39:55.972 --> 00:39:58.500
into the question of
interpretation there.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.393
Another thing,
and just a very basic thing

00:40:00.393 --> 00:40:03.373
that Katie has mentioned here,
is watching--she wants to have

00:40:03.373 --> 00:40:06.797
very prominent bow strokes,
I guess, so that everybody--the

00:40:06.797 --> 00:40:08.940
whole section--
will be in sync.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.030
If you see this kind of thing
in terms of the bow movement,

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.070
maybe the articulation really
isn't all together there.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:17.481
They should all--each of these
sections should be going in

00:40:17.481 --> 00:40:18.539
pretty much the same way.
 

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:19.260
Is that right?
 

00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.186
Bradley Naylor:
Yeah, and particularly with

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:25.650
string instruments there's a
different sound with an up-bow

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.159
as--in term--as opposed to a
down-bow.

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.170
So an up-bow will start very
small.

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.409
A down-bow you can start very
gruffly.

00:40:32.409 --> 00:40:34.170
So it does make a difference.
 

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.469
Prof: So Katie,
let me ask you this.

00:40:37.469 --> 00:40:40.275
Generally speaking,
violists don't have solos in

00:40:40.275 --> 00:40:41.289
the repertoire.
 

00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:44.175
So what's the hardest thing for
you to play there Saturday

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:44.579
night?
 

00:40:44.579 --> 00:40:46.030
What scares you?
 

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:48.119
Katie Dryden:
What scares me?

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:51.746
Well, like you said,
we don't have solos but we are

00:40:51.746 --> 00:40:56.172
very important in that we kind
of hold the upper and the lower

00:40:56.172 --> 00:41:00.090
strings and other parts of the
orchestra together.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:04.052
And I think other sections get
used to hearing us play certain

00:41:04.052 --> 00:41:07.170
parts and when we're not there,
they get lost.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.268
That's not only true for
violists.

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:11.429
It's true for pretty much
everyone.

00:41:11.429 --> 00:41:12.085
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:41:12.085 --> 00:41:12.849
That's a good point.
 

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:14.708
You're kind of like the glue
and particularly,

00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:16.030
I would imagine,
rhythmically.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:18.708
I--if you--you might be
setting--really setting the

00:41:18.708 --> 00:41:21.224
tempo and these other extremes,
high and low,

00:41:21.224 --> 00:41:24.539
are playing off of the rhythmic
tempo that you're setting there

00:41:24.539 --> 00:41:25.449
in the middle.
 

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:28.878
What's the most--is there any
moment that you sort of get to

00:41:28.878 --> 00:41:31.030
soar with some music that you
like?

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.175
Particularly,
what's your favorite moment,

00:41:33.175 --> 00:41:35.059
the most beautiful moment for
you?

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:36.639
Can you play a little of that
moment?

00:41:36.639 --> 00:41:38.514
Katie Dryden:
Sure.

00:41:38.514 --> 00:41:43.014
In the Beethoven there's a part
in the last movement where we

00:41:43.014 --> 00:41:45.190
have the melody,
finally.

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:46.780
It takes a while to get there
but we get there.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:56.260
 
 

00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:26.409
&gt;
 

00:42:26.409 --> 00:42:28.536
And that's kind of fun,
that we get to play something

00:42:28.536 --> 00:42:29.518
that people recognize.
 

00:42:29.518 --> 00:42:31.036
Prof:
&gt;

00:42:31.036 --> 00:42:31.349
Yeah.
 

00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:34.409
Well, I guess it's like maybe
the right guard or a left guard

00:42:34.409 --> 00:42:35.480
of a football team.
 

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.844
Nobody ever notices,
but they're actually crucial to

00:42:37.844 --> 00:42:39.699
the overall running of this
operation.

00:42:39.699 --> 00:42:40.112
Okay.
 

00:42:40.112 --> 00:42:43.260
Now we have also with us--thank
you,

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:45.809
Katie--we also have with us the
principal flutist,

00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:49.242
right, Elana Kagan,
and you've got some heavy-duty

00:42:49.242 --> 00:42:53.447
exposure particularly in the
Beethoven in the second movement

00:42:53.447 --> 00:42:55.829
with all of those solos there.
 

00:42:55.829 --> 00:42:59.920
So here's a question for Katie
with--excuse me--Elana.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.527
With these solos that you have
to play, do you ever get

00:43:02.527 --> 00:43:03.010
nervous?
 

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:04.929
Elana Kagan:
&gt;

00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:05.364
Of course.
 

00:43:05.364 --> 00:43:06.324
&gt;
 

00:43:06.324 --> 00:43:06.980
Definitely.
 

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:10.311
I mean, when you really have a
solo on your fingers and you

00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.068
don't have to be nervous,
it makes it even more fun,

00:43:13.068 --> 00:43:15.675
and you can always play better
when you're not so focused on

00:43:15.675 --> 00:43:16.030
that.
 

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:19.155
So I certainly try to get
beyond being nervous but

00:43:19.155 --> 00:43:22.407
there--it's definitely there and
the trickier it is,

00:43:22.407 --> 00:43:24.130
the more nervous I get.
 

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:26.081
Prof: Well,
what happens to the playing

00:43:26.081 --> 00:43:27.079
when you get nervous?
 

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:28.739
How can we recognize that
you're nervous?

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:30.119
&gt;
 

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:31.400
Elana Kagan:
Hopefully you can't,

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.612
but a lot of times messing up
is a sign of being nervous

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:37.824
because there are a lot of
players who will get it right

00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:41.389
every time in rehearsal and then
just the night of the concert

00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:43.030
will--
Prof: Yeah, that was me.

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:46.012
I always said I was the world's
greatest warm-up pianist,

00:43:46.012 --> 00:43:47.289
&gt;
 

00:43:47.289 --> 00:43:49.751
and then you get to the moment
you have to play and nerves kick

00:43:49.751 --> 00:43:51.085
in,
the--just these little

00:43:51.085 --> 00:43:53.873
fractions of inches on these
instruments is a question of

00:43:53.873 --> 00:43:54.768
life and death.
 

00:43:54.768 --> 00:43:57.481
So if your head isn't all
clear--you can imagine what a

00:43:57.481 --> 00:44:00.695
violinist would do if they would
get this huge vibrato--where did

00:44:00.695 --> 00:44:01.650
this come from?
 

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.599
&gt;
 

00:44:02.599 --> 00:44:03.047
Okay.
 

00:44:03.047 --> 00:44:07.516
So let's hear if we may,
Elana, some of the lovely,

00:44:07.516 --> 00:44:13.061
lovely imitations of bird calls
there in the second movement of

00:44:13.061 --> 00:44:14.760
the Beethoven.
 

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:19.809
What would be good for you to
play?

00:44:19.809 --> 00:44:21.460
Choose anything that you like.
 

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.639
So this is Beethoven,
second movement,

00:44:24.639 --> 00:44:27.219
theme and variations,
and--

00:44:27.219 --> 00:44:34.380
 
 

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:36.175
Elana Kagan:
Well, there's one part at

00:44:36.175 --> 00:44:37.809
the end that definitely sounds
like--

00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:40.481
Prof: Well,
you had the interesting,

00:44:40.481 --> 00:44:42.710
I guess, duet with the
clarinet,

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.527
that sort of thing,
or--is that what you were

00:44:44.527 --> 00:44:45.809
talking about toward the end?
 

00:44:45.809 --> 00:44:47.119
Elana Kagan:
The clarinet and the oboe.

00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:49.208
There is a lot of intricacies
between the wind

00:44:49.208 --> 00:44:51.483
instruments--having
conversations--so I can play a

00:44:51.483 --> 00:44:52.690
couple of those parts.
 

00:44:52.690 --> 00:45:00.179
 
 

00:45:00.179 --> 00:45:29.210
&gt;
 

00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:32.159
Prof: And then you'll
hear lots of cascading other

00:45:32.159 --> 00:45:35.099
woodwinds as Katie--
excuse me--as Elana said with

00:45:35.099 --> 00:45:38.659
the oboe and the clarinet sort
of dialoging against this.

00:45:38.659 --> 00:45:43.289
Intonation here--do you guys
practice this individually?

00:45:43.289 --> 00:45:45.516
Do you have what we would call
"sectionals"

00:45:45.516 --> 00:45:47.400
where you get together and work
this out,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.550
or do you only do this with the
full orchestra?

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:51.663
Elana Kagan:
Well, we actually haven't

00:45:51.663 --> 00:45:52.480
had sectionals.
 

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.059
That's certainly very common in
orchestras--

00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:59.085
to have sectionals to work it
out, but this semester we've

00:45:59.085 --> 00:46:03.039
mostly just worked on our own
and as a full orchestra.

00:46:03.039 --> 00:46:04.293
Prof: Uh huh.
 

00:46:04.293 --> 00:46:07.619
One of the--one thing--if
instruments are out of tune,

00:46:07.619 --> 00:46:09.940
is it--Bradley,
what do you think?

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.550
Is it often the woodwinds that
get out of tune?

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.210
Bradley Naylor:
I think that--

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:18.550
I don't want to lay blame where
it's not due,

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:21.706
but I think that sometimes it's
easier for instruments that you

00:46:21.706 --> 00:46:24.557
can press down a key and know
more or less what the right

00:46:24.557 --> 00:46:26.528
support--
what note's going to come out,

00:46:26.528 --> 00:46:28.800
but if you have a string
instrument with no frets--

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.400
like a guitar has frets on its
fingerboard,

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.489
but violins and all the string
family don't--

00:46:33.489 --> 00:46:36.202
so that's a little bit more
guesswork so it's really

00:46:36.202 --> 00:46:39.126
difficult especially in fast
passage work like Katie was

00:46:39.126 --> 00:46:42.690
playing earlier to get a uniform
intonation across the section.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.596
Prof: Uh huh.
 

00:46:43.596 --> 00:46:46.177
So we have really only about
two more minutes left and I'd

00:46:46.177 --> 00:46:47.809
like to make the following
point.

00:46:47.809 --> 00:46:49.998
One of the things you should be
on the lookout for is balance

00:46:49.998 --> 00:46:51.601
over there,
and what the French horns are

00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:53.518
doing 'cause this is a really
exposed instrument,

00:46:53.518 --> 00:46:56.422
and they're probably going to
be up there on risers and that

00:46:56.422 --> 00:46:59.326
sound tends to blare forth in
Battell so keep an eye out for

00:46:59.326 --> 00:47:00.360
the French horns.
 

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.630
They'll really be exposed.
 

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:07.719
I have one other line of
development here but I want to--

00:47:07.719 --> 00:47:09.965
before we go,
does anybody out there have a

00:47:09.965 --> 00:47:13.389
question that you would like to
ask Bradley or Katie or Elana?

00:47:13.389 --> 00:47:14.293
All right.
 

00:47:14.293 --> 00:47:17.099
Let me ask them this question.
 

00:47:17.099 --> 00:47:18.579
Where should we sit?
 

00:47:18.579 --> 00:47:22.679
What are the acoustical issues
involved in Battell?

00:47:22.679 --> 00:47:24.710
Do we want to sit so we can see?
 

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.880
And that's not bad.
 

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.054
You might say, "Hey,
well, I'll get way up in

00:47:28.054 --> 00:47:31.510
that--as far as I can and watch
this intricate orchestra,

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.907
this great, grand machine,
firing on all cylinders

00:47:34.907 --> 00:47:35.809
here."
 

00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:39.594
Or do we want to go all the way
to the back and maybe just push

00:47:39.594 --> 00:47:42.219
away the visual and just enjoy
the sound?

00:47:42.219 --> 00:47:45.204
Because oftentimes in concert
halls the best sound is not up

00:47:45.204 --> 00:47:46.583
front;
the sound is sailing right over

00:47:46.583 --> 00:47:46.929
your head.
 

00:47:46.929 --> 00:47:48.849
It's coalescing in the back of
the hall.

00:47:48.849 --> 00:47:50.300
So where should we sit?
 

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.543
Bradley Naylor:
Well, my favorite place to

00:47:52.543 --> 00:47:55.347
sit in concerts is somewhere
where I can see that interaction

00:47:55.347 --> 00:47:58.655
between the different,
I guess, gears in the machine,

00:47:58.655 --> 00:47:59.679
as you put it.
 

00:47:59.679 --> 00:48:04.449
So I would sit somewhere not
directly behind the conductor,

00:48:04.449 --> 00:48:06.932
so somewhere where you can see
the players 'cause they're the

00:48:06.932 --> 00:48:08.300
ones actually making the music.
 

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.114
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:48:09.114 --> 00:48:11.740
So if you want to go second
balcony all the way down as far

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.552
as you can go,
you can actually get up in

00:48:13.552 --> 00:48:14.820
front of the conductor.
 

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.980
You can be--almost be in the
orchestra that way.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.253
Now what about the
acoustics--the last issue

00:48:19.253 --> 00:48:21.000
here--the acoustics in Battell?
 

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.780
Are they pretty good, favorable?
 

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.199
Well, it doesn't matter.
 

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:29.789
Do you have trouble hearing?
 

00:48:29.789 --> 00:48:31.550
Katie Dryden:
Well, they are certainly

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.230
different than the room we
practice in,

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.956
which is why we have a dress
rehearsal so that we can adjust

00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:38.635
our sound according to the
acoustics of the room that we're

00:48:38.635 --> 00:48:39.329
playing in.
 

00:48:39.329 --> 00:48:45.168
But I think Battell is a lot
more live, meaning that the

00:48:45.168 --> 00:48:49.518
sound sort of--it lives longer
after--

00:48:49.518 --> 00:48:49.978
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:48:49.978 --> 00:48:50.360
It's resonant.
 

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.860
It has a very long
reverberation cycle.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.119
How do we cut down?
 

00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.960
How can you help the orchestra?
 

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.809
What would you guess?
 

00:48:57.809 --> 00:49:00.717
What would be the best way you
could help the orchestra to

00:49:00.717 --> 00:49:03.726
bring clarity to their sound and
actually allow them to play

00:49:03.726 --> 00:49:06.059
faster,
get that tempo of the Mozart to

00:49:06.059 --> 00:49:06.670
go faster?
 

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:09.117
If you've got a long
reverberation cycle in a hall,

00:49:09.117 --> 00:49:10.489
your tempo will go slower.
 

00:49:10.489 --> 00:49:12.550
What can you do to help out
here?

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.559
Nadav, what do you think?
 

00:49:13.559 --> 00:49:14.409
What would you do?
 

00:49:14.409 --> 00:49:15.400
Student: Wear a sweater.
 

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:16.380
Prof: Wear a sweater.
 

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.130
Bring a teddy bear.
 

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:19.519
Bring your friend.
 

00:49:19.519 --> 00:49:20.300
Bring your mother, grandmother.
 

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.969
Bring as many people.
 

00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:25.847
Get as many sound-absorbing
bodies in there as you possibly

00:49:25.847 --> 00:49:26.250
can.
 

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.041
So we'll see you then Saturday
night, eight o'clock,

00:49:29.041 --> 00:49:30.519
and thanks to our guests.
 

00:49:30.519 --> 00:49:36.000
&gt;
 

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000

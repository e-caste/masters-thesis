00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.010
Prof: Okay,
let me start in.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.340
This lecture is about national
security,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.572
and it's about the conflict
that's involved during the

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:12.377
twentieth century between
national security and

00:00:12.377 --> 00:00:15.000
environmental quality and human
health.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.646
So I want to explore that,
because so much money in the

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:21.280
world is spent on national
security,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.140
and it has the potential to
invade individual rights,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.950
to diminish personal freedom,
to diminish privacy.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.000
At the same time,
it has the potential to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
concentrate power and authority
among elites,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.146
political elites,
wealthy elites,

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:43.065
technical elites,
so that it's threatening to

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:48.059
democratic participation and
policy making in a variety of

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:48.760
ways.
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.230
And as we move through the
course,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.452
you'll find that secrecy is not
just an issue that we need to

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:56.836
figure out how to manage better
in the public sector relative to

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:59.493
classified information,
and this is the topic of

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:00.310
today's session.
 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.939
But it's also a critical issue
in the private sector.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.650
The growing use of confidential
business information,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.441
the growing obscurity of
product ingredients as

00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:14.891
globalized markets cause
products and services to cross

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:19.754
national borders without any
clear identity about components

00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:21.980
or potential effects.
 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.840
So national security and
environmental quality.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.105
I want you to think about this
case and other cases that we

00:01:28.105 --> 00:01:30.920
deal with as a problem of
managing intelligence.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.242
I'm not meaning to imply that
other people are not

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:37.211
intelligent,
I'm meaning to hopefully get

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.601
you to think about the idea of a
legal system that would produce

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.643
a public that was literate and
capable of understanding the

00:01:45.643 --> 00:01:48.780
quality of the environment
around them,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.339
what's threatening and what's
not, so that potentially they

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:55.040
could manage their exposure to
chemicals,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.149
they could manage the effect of
human behavior on a variety of

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.599
environmental issues,
such as endangered species.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.328
So the purpose for the title of
my book that I'm having you

00:02:08.328 --> 00:02:12.486
read, you poor things,
is the idea of thinking about

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.770
the origin of knowledge.
 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.000
You know, where do we get the
information?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.129
Where do we get the data?
 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.699
Where do we get the knowledge?
 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:20.780
Who produces it?
 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.607
And what we'll see today is
that knowledge about the

00:02:23.607 --> 00:02:26.599
environmental effects of
national security are produced

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.038
predominately by the Defense
Department.

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:32.822
They control sites,
they control the technology in

00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:35.910
weaponry and weapon delivery
systems,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.274
making it extremely difficult
for the public to understand

00:02:39.274 --> 00:02:41.340
really what the dangers might
be.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.440
Where does the knowledge flow?
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.750
Is it intelligible?
 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.830
Is it understood?
 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.140
The distinction between is it
intelligible and is it

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.220
understood is really critical.
 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.823
It involves literacy,
it involves educational

00:02:55.823 --> 00:02:58.690
background, technical
competence.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.128
And who owns it?
 

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.908
This is really a key question
for law.

00:03:01.908 --> 00:03:04.626
You can think about this in
terms of it being an

00:03:04.626 --> 00:03:06.879
intellectual property right
question.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.580
Should the public own it?
 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.463
Should the government be able
to keep the knowledge from the

00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:14.210
public?
 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.378
Should the private sector be
allowed to own it,

00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:19.348
and should they be allowed to
keep knowledge from the public?

00:03:19.348 --> 00:03:22.557
So think about it as a problem
of understanding production and

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:23.610
flow of knowledge.
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.849
Because environmental quality
is always going to be elusive

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.530
until we create a public that
really is far more intelligent,

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.334
so to speak,
understanding,

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:35.930
than it currently is.
 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.038
So what are the purposes of
secrecy?

00:03:38.038 --> 00:03:41.923
I'm kind of fascinated by the
growing classification of

00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:44.440
information in the public
sector.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.680
So that in U.S.
 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.995
history, never before has the
government been classifying more

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:51.680
information than it is today.
 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.670
You know, at the same time,
there's a very interesting

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.812
cultural change that we're
witnessing in your generation

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:01.620
related to Facebook.
 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.983
I mean, I have never seen a
generation be so interested in

00:04:04.983 --> 00:04:08.287
revealing secrets or information
about themselves as your

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:09.348
generation is.
 

00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:13.961
So it's a disconnect in a way
between government policy and

00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.617
what's going on in social
circles among younger

00:04:17.617 --> 00:04:18.889
generations.
 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.810
How do terror and warfare
depend upon secrecy?

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.139
When does secrecy threaten
national security?

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.870
When is secrecy necessary for
national security?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.399
And how is it related to
individual rights?

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:34.870
These are key questions that I
hope you'll keep in mind as we

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.269
move through this lecture today.
 

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:40.540
There are common scripts in
environmental history,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.690
no matter whether or not you
consider this case or the case

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.569
of endangered species,
the case of managing water

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:50.187
quality,
managing sustainable

00:04:50.187 --> 00:04:51.259
agriculture.
 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.800
Who knew about the problem?
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.730
Who knew about contaminants in
this case?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.170
When did they know?
 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.449
When did they inform the public?
 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.189
And what did they do about the
problem?

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:04.992
These are critical questions,
and secrecy is a central

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:06.930
component of all of them.
 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.651
So that the history that I want
to go through today is really

00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:13.620
one that is very brief.
 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.360
It only spans the period
between 1944 and 1963.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.110
So in this period,
the atomic weapons,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.329
the first atomic weapons were
designed and tested,

00:05:24.329 --> 00:05:28.810
the first one at Los Alamos in
New Mexico in 1945,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.930
followed by two uses of atomic
weapons,

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.720
the only two aggressive uses in
world history.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.149
One on Hiroshima and the other
on Nagasaki,

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:44.492
killing hundreds of thousands
of people and resulting in

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:48.896
injuries and death,
inheritable mutations that have

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:52.259
affected generations of
Japanese.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:55.319
So this compressed period is
really quite striking.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.769
Now, why in the world would we
be talking about this issue,

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:01.920
which seems so old now,
it's part of the Cold War,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:06.660
in a class on current
environmental law and policy?

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.269
Well, I'll tell you a bit of a
story.

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:14.819
In 2003, I was in the Beinecke
Rare Book Library.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:18.060
And I don't know if you have
visited the Beinecke Library,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.220
but it really is a remarkable
place.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.483
It's got a wonderful,
rich store of information,

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:27.569
especially on the American
West.

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:31.694
But I found out just by surfing
the net that they also have all

00:06:31.694 --> 00:06:34.889
of Rachel Carson's original
research material.

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.966
Now, Rachel Carson wrote
"Silent Spring"

00:06:36.966 --> 00:06:39.252
and "The Sea Around
Us" and a number of other

00:06:39.252 --> 00:06:41.579
books,
and is rather famous in

00:06:41.579 --> 00:06:44.971
environmental history,
particularly for her work

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:48.168
trying to get the public to wake
up about the dangers of

00:06:48.168 --> 00:06:50.447
pesticides,
especially related to wildlife

00:06:50.447 --> 00:06:53.074
because she was a wildlife
biologist working for the Fish

00:06:53.074 --> 00:06:54.199
and Wildlife Service.
 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.581
Well it turns out that all of
her original research materials,

00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:00.629
including about 120 boxes of
material, are stored in the

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.459
basement of Beinecke Library.
 

00:07:02.459 --> 00:07:05.595
So going through those,
as I was trying to understand

00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:08.851
the history of pesticides,
I found one file that was on

00:07:08.851 --> 00:07:10.540
nuclear weapons testing.
 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.199
And that file was incredibly
dense.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.406
And as she conducted her
research, by the way,

00:07:17.406 --> 00:07:21.755
it's very different than what
we do today when our research is

00:07:21.755 --> 00:07:23.610
almost all electronic.
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.327
She would hand copy material,
there were no copy machines

00:07:27.327 --> 00:07:30.449
that she had access to at that
point in time.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.115
And then she would write notes,
little side notes interpreting

00:07:33.115 --> 00:07:34.120
it as she went along.
 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.387
So going through this,
I realized that all of her work

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:41.269
on pesticides where she wondered
what happened to them once they

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:42.379
were released.
 

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.091
Where they went,
how did they make their way

00:07:45.091 --> 00:07:46.100
into the soil?
 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.531
Why were wildlife,
the canaries in the mine in a

00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:53.841
sense, what were the wildlife
telling us about human hazards

00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.230
and human risk?
 

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.404
And what was wrong with current
law and policy that would allow

00:07:59.404 --> 00:08:03.038
that kind of release and
non-accountability on the part

00:08:03.038 --> 00:08:04.790
of the private sector?
 

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.319
So she learned that way of
thinking,

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:11.259
that narrative logic,
she learned that,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:15.084
not by studying pesticides,
by looking at the history of

00:08:15.084 --> 00:08:19.327
the Atomic Energy Commission in
the 1950s and how they came to

00:08:19.327 --> 00:08:23.291
understand radionuclides and
what happened to them and the

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:26.769
kind of threat they posed to
water quality,

00:08:26.769 --> 00:08:29.160
to air quality,
how they got into wildlife,

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.910
how they got into human tissue.
 

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:32.519
So this is a story of today.
 

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:36.839
So the idea that the success in
any of these cases is dependent

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:40.879
upon very high quality science
is a very important idea.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:42.538
And remember what I said the
other day,

00:08:42.538 --> 00:08:46.210
that perhaps ninety-five
percent of the science in the

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.158
field of environmental science
is conducted in the private

00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:52.940
sector,
it never sees the light of day.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.479
Well in this case,
this is probably the best

00:08:56.479 --> 00:09:00.428
example of state science at an
enormous scale.

00:09:00.428 --> 00:09:04.009
The Atomic Energy Commission
had an unlimited budget,

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:08.533
they had unlimited authority,
and they had unlimited capacity

00:09:08.533 --> 00:09:12.907
to tell a story about danger and
the importance of pursuing

00:09:12.907 --> 00:09:16.977
atomic weapons development in
order to protect national

00:09:16.977 --> 00:09:18.110
security.
 

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.067
So this time span just gives
you the number of tests per year

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:25.134
between 1945,
or actually,

00:09:25.134 --> 00:09:28.769
the number of explosions,
1945 and 1962.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:34.462
In 1963, President Kennedy
worked with the Soviets to pass

00:09:34.462 --> 00:09:37.460
the Limited Test Ban Treaty.
 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:41.807
And since that time,
atmospheric testing has been

00:09:41.807 --> 00:09:43.529
severely limited.
 

00:09:43.529 --> 00:09:47.432
Known nuclear tests worldwide
between '45 and '96,

00:09:47.432 --> 00:09:50.700
roughly about 2,000,
maybe about 2,400.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.380
After 1963, the majority of
tests, or the number of tests

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.629
actually went up.
 

00:09:55.629 --> 00:09:57.908
But most of them went
underground.

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:00.741
So underground testing is
allowed, and we'll see later on

00:10:00.741 --> 00:10:04.080
in the lecture that there have
been certain parts of the world,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:09.889
it's been agreed among nations
that have this nuclear capacity

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:11.700
to avoid testing.
 

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.759
So outer space is now off
limits.

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:18.966
Testing in the South Pacific is
now off limits because it was

00:10:18.966 --> 00:10:24.000
the site of many highly intense
tests of hydrogen bombs.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.057
And also, testing on the poles
is restricted by international

00:10:29.057 --> 00:10:30.070
agreement.
 

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.330
So this was a very limited
period of time,

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.032
and many people don't
understand where these tests

00:10:35.032 --> 00:10:36.080
were conducted.
 

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.080
Some in the South Atlantic,
some in Mississippi,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.690
some in Japan,
New Mexico, the Pacific Ocean,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.168
the Nevada Test Site,
Johnson Island,

00:10:46.168 --> 00:10:49.960
Christmas Island,
Eniwetok and Bikini,

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.980
which are part of the Marshall
Islands in the Pacific.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.010
I'll be speaking more about
this and show you some film

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:57.370
clips on next Tuesday when we
reconvene.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:04.692
One interesting aspect of this
history was the behavior of

00:11:04.692 --> 00:11:07.924
Klaus Fuchs,
who was a theoretical scientist

00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:10.580
working at Los Alamos on the
development of the first weapon,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.823
the first atomic bomb,
during what is known as the

00:11:12.823 --> 00:11:13.740
Manhattan Project.
 

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.190
And he had access to top-secret
material.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.537
A very highly skilled
physicist, and he passed most of

00:11:20.537 --> 00:11:24.720
what he knew on to the Soviets
in the late 1940s.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.726
So he was tried and convicted
of espionage in Britain in the

00:11:28.726 --> 00:11:33.210
1950s, and he served nine years
out of a fourteen-year sentence.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.668
This is fascinating to me.
 

00:11:34.668 --> 00:11:36.570
Think about the nature of the
sanction here.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.408
So that the Soviets gained
their understanding of how the

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:40.820
U.S.
 

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.524
produced nuclear weapons and
gained an understanding of what

00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:47.229
our strategy was,
how we were testing it,

00:11:47.229 --> 00:11:49.558
how we were monitoring the
effects,

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.558
what the intensity of the
radiation was.

00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:54.740
And the man serves only nine
years in prison.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.149
The lesson is kind of curious.
 

00:11:59.149 --> 00:12:03.839
Most secrets have very short
lives, and the more valuable

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:07.440
they are, the more limited is
their life.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.158
So I think about the idea of
creating a secret as creating a

00:12:12.158 --> 00:12:13.519
property right.
 

00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:18.510
And so it creates a property
right and its value is dependent

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:22.669
on many aspects of its
character, and we'll explore

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:25.000
that as we move through.
 

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The power of explosions on the
Bikini Atoll in the South

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.129
Pacific is something to take
note of.

00:12:30.129 --> 00:12:32.970
Next Tuesday,
we'll come back to this story,

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:36.386
where the Bikini Islanders were
removed from their island

00:12:36.386 --> 00:12:39.559
through negotiation and the use
of eminent domain.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:41.250
And then the U.S.
 

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.798
proceeded to test about
twenty-five,

00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.168
twenty-six different nuclear
weapons,

00:12:47.168 --> 00:12:52.371
including the Bravo Test in
1954 that I'll show you a clip

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:54.631
of,
which was one of the largest

00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.590
bombs ever exploded by the U.S.
 

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.808
in the atmosphere.
 

00:12:57.808 --> 00:13:02.799
The Atomic Energy Commission
created what they called Project

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:07.375
Gabriel that evolved to be
called Project Sunshine--that

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:10.120
lasted between 1949 and 1961.
 

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.116
So Project Sunshine became
famous, and it was the

00:13:13.116 --> 00:13:16.738
collection of scientists in the
government working with the

00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:20.547
Atomic Energy Commission based
predominately at the University

00:13:20.547 --> 00:13:23.169
of Chicago and Columbia
University,

00:13:23.169 --> 00:13:24.850
the Lamont Laboratories.
 

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.381
So scientists were given
virtually unlimited funds to

00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:32.456
conduct research that would help
the Atomic Energy Commission

00:13:32.456 --> 00:13:35.990
understand the power of their
different weapons.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.863
And there were some 200
different types of nuclear

00:13:38.863 --> 00:13:41.210
weapons eventually that were
designed.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:45.447
And some so large that they had
to redesign aircraft in order to

00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:48.826
handle the weight,
and others so small that they

00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:53.164
could be tactically carried in a
suitcase and be used under field

00:13:53.164 --> 00:13:55.808
conditions that were very
difficult.

00:13:55.808 --> 00:13:59.639
Different delivery mechanisms,
delivery by aircraft,

00:13:59.639 --> 00:14:02.230
delivery by missile,
delivery by artillery,

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:07.235
delivery by suitcase,
so that a variety of different

00:14:07.235 --> 00:14:12.535
types of bombs of different
strengths were designed for

00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:15.580
different types of warfare.
 

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:19.193
So the Sunshine scientists
really ramped up in the early

00:14:19.193 --> 00:14:19.720
1950s.
 

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.849
And what's interesting is the
way that they thought about

00:14:22.849 --> 00:14:24.190
environmental science.
 

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.048
They wondered what happened to
the radionuclides.

00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:29.750
Where do they go when a bomb
explodes, what happens?

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.840
Well, dust particles get blown
up into the atmosphere.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.259
If you drop a bomb in shallow
water,

00:14:35.259 --> 00:14:38.410
it will take the material on
the bottom of the water and will

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:41.405
take the fish and it will
basically blow everything up and

00:14:41.405 --> 00:14:43.350
the coral up into the
atmosphere.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.899
It will also kill any birds
that are in close proximity.

00:14:49.899 --> 00:14:54.086
So every test has a story about
birds raining from the sky,

00:14:54.086 --> 00:14:54.808
on fire.
 

00:14:54.808 --> 00:14:59.068
It will also cause a pattern of
movement in the atmosphere that

00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:02.710
depends very much upon climate
and wind conditions.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:05.451
And the power of the bomb
determines how high up into the

00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:06.970
atmosphere the particles get.
 

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.365
So dozens and dozens of
different nuclides were created,

00:15:10.365 --> 00:15:13.389
some of which had never been
recognized before.

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:18.191
So trying to figure this out,
one of the first things they

00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:21.730
did was they set up a monitoring
system.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.690
That made sense.
 

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.214
If you want to figure out where
something is going,

00:15:26.214 --> 00:15:27.879
you set up a monitoring system.
 

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:29.919
In this case,
it was rather simplistic,

00:15:29.919 --> 00:15:32.389
around the Nevada Test Site
north of Las Vegas,

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.840
about sixty-five miles.
 

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.038
And people used to cluster on
tops of the casinos and the

00:15:37.038 --> 00:15:40.009
hotels in the evening to watch
the bombs explode,

00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:42.467
or get up really early in the
morning to watch the bombs

00:15:42.467 --> 00:15:44.192
explode,
highly visible,

00:15:44.192 --> 00:15:46.250
given the clear climate.
 

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:50.009
So they set up their monitors
and they presumed that they had

00:15:50.009 --> 00:15:52.389
captured the dispersal of
radiation.

00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:56.269
And then they began to get
reports.

00:15:56.269 --> 00:15:59.601
Reports came in from different
parts of the country,

00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:02.999
some in North Dakota from
people that were mining for

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:05.940
uranium that had carried Geiger
counters.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.226
And one miner was telling a
story where he was eating dinner

00:16:10.226 --> 00:16:14.658
at his campfire with his Geiger
counter that he forgot to turn

00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:15.240
off.
 

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.991
And the Geiger counter started
to spit back at him,

00:16:18.991 --> 00:16:21.620
&lt;&lt;stuttering
noise&gt;&gt;.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.331
And he said,
"Oh boy,

00:16:22.331 --> 00:16:23.730
you know, I've got to have this
thing serviced.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.774
It must be out of tune,
it must be detecting something

00:16:26.774 --> 00:16:28.269
that is not there."
 

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:31.989
So he took it in to have it
serviced and found out that it

00:16:31.989 --> 00:16:35.970
was actually in great tune,
didn't need to be recalibrated.

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:38.548
He went back to his site and it
happened again.

00:16:38.548 --> 00:16:42.519
So he realized gradually that
something was going on in the

00:16:42.519 --> 00:16:43.408
atmosphere.
 

00:16:43.408 --> 00:16:46.490
It wasn't measuring anything in
the mine or in nearby rock

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:49.298
because it normally in that
place would be silent.

00:16:49.298 --> 00:16:53.360
He was picking up radionuclides
that were raining down in North

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.950
Dakota.
 

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:58.764
Polaroid became important in
the process of understanding the

00:16:58.764 --> 00:17:01.255
distribution,
Polaroid Film Company,

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:04.439
because its film was found to
be exposed when it arrived at

00:17:04.439 --> 00:17:08.058
doctors' offices and hospitals
in different parts of the world.

00:17:08.058 --> 00:17:12.786
And at that point in time,
they used to put the Polaroid

00:17:12.786 --> 00:17:16.480
film, the eight-and-a-half by
eleven sheets,

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:17.769
into boxes.
 

00:17:17.769 --> 00:17:20.041
And then they would pack the
boxes, you know,

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:22.830
not with these Styrofoam
kernels that we use today that

00:17:22.830 --> 00:17:24.019
will never go away.
 

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:27.229
But instead,
they used to pack it with

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:28.269
cornhusks.
 

00:17:28.269 --> 00:17:31.531
So gradually,
they figured it out because

00:17:31.531 --> 00:17:36.671
they could see in some cases the
image of the cornhusk on top of

00:17:36.671 --> 00:17:39.200
the film matching directly.
 

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.230
So what was happening?
 

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.328
Well, the radionuclides were
intersecting a cloud,

00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:46.242
they were raining down,
in this case in the Midwestern

00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:49.230
part of the United States,
where the box had been packed.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.204
And the cornhusks were exposing
the film, because they had

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.720
absorbed the radionuclides.
 

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.278
So they realized gradually that
their donut 200 miles in

00:17:57.278 --> 00:18:00.901
diameter around Las Vegas was
completely inappropriate to

00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.358
capture the scale of this
problem.

00:18:03.358 --> 00:18:06.280
This is a very important lesson
in environmental science and

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:07.420
environmental policy.
 

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:14.063
It's like the analogy of the
drunk leaning on a light post

00:18:14.063 --> 00:18:17.210
looking for his car keys.
 

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:20.170
Why is he looking under the
light post?

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:21.858
That's because that's where the
light is.

00:18:21.858 --> 00:18:25.381
So that there are many,
many different stories about

00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:29.453
the failure of environmental
science and the ineffectiveness

00:18:29.453 --> 00:18:32.905
of environmental law that flow
from this problem of

00:18:32.905 --> 00:18:37.670
misunderstanding the need for a
very sensitive sampling design.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.286
In this case,
the Stokes test in 1957 put

00:18:40.286 --> 00:18:43.556
radionuclides into the
atmosphere, but they started

00:18:43.556 --> 00:18:47.348
moving at different directions
at different altitudes.

00:18:47.348 --> 00:18:50.058
Ooh, there's an interesting
idea, that's novel.

00:18:50.058 --> 00:18:52.328
No one thought about that
before.

00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:57.160
So here, the dashed line at the
bottom is moving at 30,000 feet,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:00.838
and it just nicks the southeast
side of Idaho.

00:19:00.838 --> 00:19:05.002
Whereas the dust at 10,000 feet
shoots all the way up to

00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:05.759
Montana.
 

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:08.832
Then it arcs up over southern
Canada, comes back over the

00:19:08.832 --> 00:19:09.598
Great Lakes.
 

00:19:09.598 --> 00:19:13.039
Then you see that arc of the
dashed line coming right down

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:16.420
across Lake Champlain on the New
York-Vermont border,

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.981
the Massachusetts-New York
border, and then the Connecticut

00:19:18.981 --> 00:19:19.380
border.
 

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.990
Well that's pretty interesting.
 

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:25.343
Another test that they followed
created dust clouds that again

00:19:25.343 --> 00:19:27.769
were driven by weather patterns.
 

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:30.493
And you see in this case that
at 30,000 feet,

00:19:30.493 --> 00:19:33.220
one swirled around Texas for
about a week.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:37.028
Another one swooped all the way
at 20,000 feet down into

00:19:37.028 --> 00:19:39.388
Florida,
and probably would have been

00:19:39.388 --> 00:19:42.816
detected if they had rainstorms
in Florida at the time of the

00:19:42.816 --> 00:19:46.249
dust cloud that got there,
that would have been detectable

00:19:46.249 --> 00:19:48.262
in oranges,
in orange juice,

00:19:48.262 --> 00:19:49.880
and in orange oils.
 

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.144
So that crops were being
threatened and exposed in a

00:19:53.144 --> 00:19:56.856
variety of different ways that
were being driven by weather

00:19:56.856 --> 00:19:57.690
patterns.
 

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:00.501
And we all know that even
today, it's hard to predict what

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:03.561
the weather's going to be within
thirty-six hours in many parts

00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:04.500
of the country.
 

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:09.001
So that the state of weather
forecasting back at this time

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:10.740
was quite primitive.
 

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:13.361
So that basically told these
scientists, and then again,

00:20:13.361 --> 00:20:16.125
I can just imagine what they
were doing, sitting across the

00:20:16.125 --> 00:20:17.650
table looking at each other.
 

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.118
How are we going to manage this?
 

00:20:19.118 --> 00:20:21.298
What's going to happen if the
public understands this?

00:20:21.298 --> 00:20:24.934
How are we going to maintain
our political support for the

00:20:24.934 --> 00:20:28.760
weapons testing program so that
we can keep on building these

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.460
weapons to contain the Soviets
or to strike fear into their

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:33.288
hearts?
 

00:20:33.288 --> 00:20:35.529
Following their policy of
deterrence,

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:38.384
the bigger the bomb,
the less likely we are to be

00:20:38.384 --> 00:20:42.013
attacked by other nations that
would understand that an attack

00:20:42.013 --> 00:20:43.680
would be simply suicide.
 

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:49.078
Well, here is a chart,
which is an amalgamation of

00:20:49.078 --> 00:20:55.358
different bomb blasts and the
pathways that they took,

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:58.806
and the darkest areas are areas
that received the highest doses

00:20:58.806 --> 00:20:59.640
of radiation.
 

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:04.517
And these nuclides have
half-lives that vary between

00:21:04.517 --> 00:21:08.916
roughly three to four weeks up
to forty, fifty,

00:21:08.916 --> 00:21:10.828
a hundred years.
 

00:21:10.828 --> 00:21:14.932
So that if you went to the
center of the country in Iowa

00:21:14.932 --> 00:21:18.849
and you took tests of the soil,
you could still detect many of

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:20.368
these radionuclides in the soil.
 

00:21:20.368 --> 00:21:25.108
And they are transferable from
soil to crops and up to fruits.

00:21:25.108 --> 00:21:29.047
So that this patchiness and
fallout was eventually

00:21:29.047 --> 00:21:34.029
recognized by the Atomic Energy
Commission in the mid-1950s.

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:36.474
And gradually,
once this information was

00:21:36.474 --> 00:21:40.279
declassified in the early 1990s,
and the only reason I'm telling

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:43.499
you this story is because most
of this knowledge was eventually

00:21:43.499 --> 00:21:44.328
declassified.
 

00:21:44.328 --> 00:21:46.492
I couldn't be here,
which is kind of an interesting

00:21:46.492 --> 00:21:48.270
thought,
I couldn't be here right now

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.968
telling you this story had the
declassification process not

00:21:50.968 --> 00:21:53.058
occurred under the Clinton
Administration.

00:21:53.058 --> 00:21:56.193
Once they realized that the
Atomic Energy Commission had

00:21:56.193 --> 00:21:58.759
kept all this information from
the public,

00:21:58.759 --> 00:22:02.818
when they really had no
national security logic to do

00:22:02.818 --> 00:22:03.210
so.
 

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:06.736
So here is a map of the United
States constructed by the

00:22:06.736 --> 00:22:09.750
National Cancer Institute in the
late 1990s,

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.920
that took the dose estimates
that they got from the soils,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.224
because they could back
calculate the concentrations

00:22:16.224 --> 00:22:19.544
from existing concentrations,
knowing the decay rate of

00:22:19.544 --> 00:22:20.538
different nuclides.
 

00:22:20.538 --> 00:22:24.048
And they developed this map of
expected doses.

00:22:24.048 --> 00:22:27.788
And then the Cancer Institute
started asking questions,

00:22:27.788 --> 00:22:30.835
because they understood the
dose-response relationship for

00:22:30.835 --> 00:22:33.720
radiation and these nuclides is
really pretty clear.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.755
This not like you have to drink
10,000 cans of diet soda to

00:22:38.755 --> 00:22:43.356
absorb enough saccharine to
elevate your cancer risk a

00:22:43.356 --> 00:22:44.660
little bit.
 

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:50.201
This is a science that evolved
in the 1950s largely because of

00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:54.652
the importance to the military
that understood the

00:22:54.652 --> 00:22:58.740
dose-response relationship quite
clearly.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.230
But understanding a
dose-response relationship,

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.380
meaning, let's see,
the best way to explain

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:07.348
dose-response relationship if
it's not familiar to you,

00:23:07.348 --> 00:23:12.099
especially for college
students, is to think about a

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:13.868
six-pack of beer.
 

00:23:13.868 --> 00:23:16.990
So you get a six-pack of beer,
you have one beer.

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:18.490
You might feel a little bit of
it.

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:22.359
You have two beers within
fifteen minutes.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.430
I know you'd never do that.
 

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.259
You have three beers within
twenty minutes.

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:31.667
You have six beers within an
hour so that the effect that you

00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:33.698
feel,
the effect on your body,

00:23:33.698 --> 00:23:36.643
depends upon the dose and the
concentration that you're

00:23:36.643 --> 00:23:38.769
actually circulating in your
system.

00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:41.691
So they understood this
relationship with great clarity

00:23:41.691 --> 00:23:43.585
with respect to these
radionuclides,

00:23:43.585 --> 00:23:46.670
so that the cancer estimates
really are quite robust.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:50.364
One interesting thing is that
if you look at the pattern of

00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:55.486
testing that really,
it peaked in the late 1950s so

00:23:55.486 --> 00:24:01.460
that you see this is
radionuclides in rainwater.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.932
And then there was an agreement
not to test for a period of two

00:24:05.932 --> 00:24:06.509
years.
 

00:24:06.509 --> 00:24:08.170
And you see that the rainwater
levels declined.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.410
It's in the rainwater.
 

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:10.640
Hmm, that's interesting.
 

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.700
If it's in the rainwater,
what does that mean for fish?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.348
What does it mean for rivers?
 

00:24:14.348 --> 00:24:17.741
What does it mean for parts of
the West that experience high

00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:18.950
levels of snowpack?
 

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.260
Well, it means that snowpack,
for example,

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:25.328
Jackson, Wyoming a couple years
ago.

00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:28.961
Jackson Hole,
Wyoming received more than 600

00:24:28.961 --> 00:24:31.410
inches of snow in one year.
 

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.644
And in a matter of about a
month in the period between

00:24:35.644 --> 00:24:39.082
April and late May,
you get basically warmer

00:24:39.082 --> 00:24:41.720
weather melting all the snow.
 

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.471
So in this period of time you
get this rush,

00:24:44.471 --> 00:24:47.606
you get this pulse of
radioactive water that moves

00:24:47.606 --> 00:24:48.759
into a stream.
 

00:24:48.759 --> 00:24:51.130
And lo and behold,
where could you test that?

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:53.240
Well, you could test that in
the supermarket.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.619
Where?
 

00:24:54.619 --> 00:24:55.420
In what supermarket?
 

00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.990
In the salmon in supermarkets,
the trout in the supermarket.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:59.930
Buying trout in the supermarket.
 

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:05.355
You could find these levels
increasing in the Columbia River

00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:10.230
that goes by the Hanford uranium
enrichment plant,

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.618
plutonium enrichment plant in
the state of Washington.

00:25:13.618 --> 00:25:16.026
So the water levels,
concentrations were going up

00:25:16.026 --> 00:25:18.532
because the rainwater
concentrations were going up,

00:25:18.532 --> 00:25:20.838
and the fish concentrations
were going up.

00:25:20.838 --> 00:25:23.974
And also, people that were
drinking water out of wells that

00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:27.056
were fed underground by the
aquifer from the Hanford area,

00:25:27.056 --> 00:25:28.838
they were also being exposed.
 

00:25:28.838 --> 00:25:33.066
The per capita dose was
calculated as well,

00:25:33.066 --> 00:25:38.702
and you see the dip between
January of 1960 and late 1962

00:25:38.702 --> 00:25:43.029
during the agreed cessation of
testing.

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:46.470
So this information was really
quite robust.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.997
So Project Sunshine basically
pieced together this idea that

00:25:50.997 --> 00:25:54.450
these nuclides were in global
circulation,

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.808
they were contaminating every
aspect of our environment,

00:25:57.808 --> 00:26:00.240
and they were making their way
into humans,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.588
and particularly they were
concerned about strontium-90,

00:26:05.588 --> 00:26:08.690
because if you have a diet that
is low in calcium,

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.273
your body's going to absorb
more strontium-90 into your

00:26:11.273 --> 00:26:11.608
bone.
 

00:26:11.608 --> 00:26:16.375
Also, if you have a diet that's
low in iodine,

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:23.049
your thyroid is going to absorb
more iodine-131 than it normally

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:24.108
would.
 

00:26:24.108 --> 00:26:29.262
So understanding this
relationship between calcium and

00:26:29.262 --> 00:26:34.496
strontium-90 is very important,
because it eventually led to

00:26:34.496 --> 00:26:37.818
calcium enrichment of breads,
of milk.

00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:42.246
So the fortification program
really had its origination in

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:46.130
recommendations by the Atomic
Energy Commission.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.545
So the public thought,
oh, we're just getting more

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:49.680
minerals in our diet.
 

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.500
Well, that must be a good
thing, the nutritionists must be

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.529
arguing that this makes a lot of
sense.

00:26:54.529 --> 00:26:57.012
But in reality,
what was going on was that the

00:26:57.012 --> 00:27:00.104
Atomic Energy Commission was
anxiously wringing its hands

00:27:00.104 --> 00:27:03.580
recognizing that they've got to
figure out how to lower the dose

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:05.900
being experienced in the
population.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.440
The population had no idea what
was going on.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.183
So Project Sunshine scientists,
they eventually obtained 15,000

00:27:13.183 --> 00:27:14.578
bodies,
dead bodies,

00:27:14.578 --> 00:27:17.411
trying to understand the
distribution of these nuclides

00:27:17.411 --> 00:27:18.670
throughout the world.
 

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.134
Bodies from New York,
San Francisco,

00:27:21.134 --> 00:27:23.809
Houston, Japan,
India, South Africa.

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:25.430
Why from other nations?
 

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.904
Well, predominately because
they were worried about other

00:27:28.904 --> 00:27:32.691
nations coming back and telling
the United States that we were

00:27:32.691 --> 00:27:35.670
contaminating not only their
food supplies,

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.028
which was going to harm their
ability to trade products

00:27:39.028 --> 00:27:41.923
internationally,
processed foods,

00:27:41.923 --> 00:27:47.920
water, just about any kind of
crop you could think of,

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.608
as well as animals.
 

00:27:49.608 --> 00:27:54.068
So that gradually over the
period between 1955 and 1960,

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:57.603
the Atomic Energy Commission
grew to really understand the

00:27:57.603 --> 00:28:01.321
global distributional pattern
and how people in certain areas

00:28:01.321 --> 00:28:04.980
of Latin America and tropical
areas were really experiencing

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.150
quite high levels of fallout.
 

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:08.640
Why would that be?
 

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.588
In tropical rainforests,
they experience intense

00:28:11.588 --> 00:28:12.278
rainfall.
 

00:28:12.278 --> 00:28:16.838
So that the rain was so high
that it would concentrate the

00:28:16.838 --> 00:28:20.680
nuclides in some of the tropical
forest areas.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.063
So permission to take the body
parts was never sought or

00:28:24.063 --> 00:28:24.740
obtained.
 

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.160
Family members were never
consulted.

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:30.200
Bones were cleaned and packaged
in formalin.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:33.500
And then they were crushed and
analyzed by laboratory

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.799
technicians at Columbia and
other prestigious U.S.

00:28:36.799 --> 00:28:38.730
academic institutions.
 

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.130
And sometimes the bones were
pooled together.

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:43.916
Gradually they decided that
they were going to look for

00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:46.654
geographic variability and they
were going to look for

00:28:46.654 --> 00:28:48.098
age-related variability.
 

00:28:48.098 --> 00:28:50.988
Because they were finding that
kids, for some reason,

00:28:50.988 --> 00:28:53.211
were absorbing more of the
radionuclides,

00:28:53.211 --> 00:28:55.599
especially strontium,
than adults were.

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:56.960
So why would that be?
 

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.608
Was it something about their
diet?

00:28:58.608 --> 00:29:00.410
Was there something about their
physiology?

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:05.240
Well, it had to do with their
rate of growth of bone.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.594
So kids are growing most
rapidly at what point in their

00:29:09.594 --> 00:29:10.240
lives?
 

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:14.817
Well, from time of conception
roughly until the time of

00:29:14.817 --> 00:29:15.750
thirteen.
 

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:20.330
But different organ systems and
different functions in the body

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.400
mature at different rates.
 

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.355
So stature, for example,
is quite linear,

00:29:26.355 --> 00:29:32.390
although you get this really
serious growth curve in utero.

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.067
And then it goes up gradually,
gradually, and then more

00:29:36.067 --> 00:29:38.858
steeply during the early teenage
years.

00:29:38.858 --> 00:29:41.671
So you could figure out the
concentrations that were

00:29:41.671 --> 00:29:45.200
correlated with these periods of
rapid growth and development.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.751
So gradually,
these secrets started to leak

00:29:48.751 --> 00:29:49.259
out.
 

00:29:49.259 --> 00:29:52.069
And the U.S.
 

00:29:52.069 --> 00:29:53.420
began to study fallout data.
 

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:56.609
And once the Soviets had
developed their own capacity to

00:29:56.609 --> 00:29:59.974
make and test nuclear weapons,
the Atomic Energy Commission

00:29:59.974 --> 00:30:01.598
had this great argument.
 

00:30:01.598 --> 00:30:05.281
Well, there are nuclides in our
food supply and in our bodies,

00:30:05.281 --> 00:30:06.548
it's not our fault.
 

00:30:06.548 --> 00:30:08.157
Well, we take some
responsibility,

00:30:08.157 --> 00:30:09.618
but it's the Soviets' fault.
 

00:30:09.618 --> 00:30:12.480
The Soviets were actually
testing these weapons up in

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:13.028
Siberia.
 

00:30:13.028 --> 00:30:17.071
And the Siberian radionuclides
tended to come down across

00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:21.330
Alaska and across Canada and
into the Western and Midwestern

00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.644
part of the U.S.,
so in threads that are similar

00:30:24.644 --> 00:30:27.920
to the ones that I showed you
from the Nevada test site.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.618
So the U.S.
 

00:30:29.618 --> 00:30:33.027
was trying to at this point
desperately maintain public

00:30:33.027 --> 00:30:36.847
support for continued testing,
in part because they were

00:30:36.847 --> 00:30:39.701
wondering well,
what would happen if we did

00:30:39.701 --> 00:30:40.940
have a nuclear war?
 

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.140
Where would the nuclides go?
 

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.960
And what would our capacity to
respond be?

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:50.280
So these were legitimate
national security concerns that

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.609
they were exploring.
 

00:30:51.609 --> 00:30:53.618
So the U.S.
 

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:56.980
began to release some of its
information at the same time

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.920
that states started their own
testing programs.

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.720
So just like you find
variability in air pollution

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.563
today from motor vehicles,
depending upon climate and

00:31:07.563 --> 00:31:09.769
where vehicle use is most
intense,

00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:13.730
you find in this case states
being worried about specific

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.690
patterns of concentration in the
crops that they grow.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.634
Vermont cheese,
for example,

00:31:20.634 --> 00:31:27.068
or Midwestern grains or cattle
grazed in the Western U.S.

00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:29.935
So Minnesota,
Vermont, and other states felt

00:31:29.935 --> 00:31:32.670
like they were environmental
hotspots,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.519
and that their corporations
were being hindered,

00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.943
their capacity to trade
nationally and internationally

00:31:39.943 --> 00:31:41.430
was being diminished.
 

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:42.568
The U.S.
 

00:31:42.568 --> 00:31:47.195
finally started an open test of
milk for radioactivity in 1957,

00:31:47.195 --> 00:31:50.328
twelve years after the
explosions began.

00:31:50.328 --> 00:31:54.824
And Linus Pauling,
who won the Nobel Prize for his

00:31:54.824 --> 00:31:58.569
work on nutrition,
particularly related to vitamin

00:31:58.569 --> 00:32:01.566
C, came out with his conclusion
that the body really

00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:05.266
discriminates against strontium
and favors calcium uptake if the

00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:07.440
calcium levels were high enough.
 

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.355
That prompted the addition of
the calcium, as I was saying,

00:32:11.355 --> 00:32:13.516
to milk, bread,
and animal feeds,

00:32:13.516 --> 00:32:15.339
as well as fertilizers.
 

00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:18.480
So this is quite curious.
 

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.048
The Surgeon General for the U.S.
 

00:32:22.048 --> 00:32:25.982
denied that the fallout hazards
were serious in the New York

00:32:25.982 --> 00:32:27.048
Times in 1959.
 

00:32:27.048 --> 00:32:31.943
So there was really quite an
open public debate in the late

00:32:31.943 --> 00:32:37.007
'50s, in part that surrounded
Eisenhower's campaign to become

00:32:37.007 --> 00:32:39.368
president again in 1956.
 

00:32:39.368 --> 00:32:42.019
And his competitor was his vice
president, Adlai Stevenson.

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:46.154
So Stevenson basically broke
the news that the Atomic Energy

00:32:46.154 --> 00:32:50.500
Commission had been hiding this
information from the public.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:56.230
And in his last-minute campaign
effort,

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:59.104
he claimed that there were
genetic hazards to future

00:32:59.104 --> 00:33:01.210
generations,
risk of bone cancer,

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.549
and the inability to conduct
medical investigations.

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.880
Now, this is interesting.
 

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.007
So that there is exposure that
is universal,

00:33:09.007 --> 00:33:12.278
everybody's exposed because
everybody eats.

00:33:12.278 --> 00:33:15.914
That means that you really
don't have any opportunity for a

00:33:15.914 --> 00:33:19.926
scientific control group that is
unexposed to figure out what the

00:33:19.926 --> 00:33:22.308
long-term health effects might
be.

00:33:22.308 --> 00:33:26.409
Thirteen Yale scientists,
including Arthur Galston of the

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:30.428
Biology Department,
who passed away just a few

00:33:30.428 --> 00:33:33.123
years ago,
signed a statement endorsing

00:33:33.123 --> 00:33:34.480
the views of Stevenson.
 

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.461
Stevenson lost,
Eisenhower became president

00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:38.029
again.
 

00:33:38.029 --> 00:33:43.148
And what was interesting about
it is that transcripts from his

00:33:43.148 --> 00:33:46.421
conferences, his national
security team,

00:33:46.421 --> 00:33:50.450
had been released in the late
1990s as well.

00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:54.506
And Eisenhower eventually got
to the point where he was

00:33:54.506 --> 00:33:58.711
telling his staff that the
levels of radionuclides in the

00:33:58.711 --> 00:34:01.579
milk supply,
the buildup especially in

00:34:01.579 --> 00:34:03.647
children's bones,
was unacceptable,

00:34:03.647 --> 00:34:05.818
and something was going to have
to happen.

00:34:05.818 --> 00:34:09.677
And that prompted him to be
more aggressive in trying to

00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:13.673
negotiate with the Soviets to
create some sort of a treaty

00:34:13.673 --> 00:34:16.619
that would reduce atmospheric
testing.

00:34:16.619 --> 00:34:20.480
So I'm going to jump ahead here
so I don't run out of time.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.108
The Atomic Energy Commission
also was found to have withheld

00:34:24.108 --> 00:34:27.798
data recognizing that there were
these spikes in the New York

00:34:27.798 --> 00:34:31.184
cities' milk supplies,
data that was collected just

00:34:31.184 --> 00:34:34.880
prior to the election that they
understood posed a problem.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.760
They held that until weeks
after the election.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.545
So it's kind of curious that
milk became the standard for

00:34:40.545 --> 00:34:43.860
trying to figure out where the
chemicals went,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.969
especially powdered buttermilk,
because in its dehydrated form,

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:49.909
it was easy to send around the
country.

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:54.784
And this chart I think is also
interesting, because remember

00:34:54.784 --> 00:34:59.574
that the Limited Test Ban Treaty
of 1963 really stopped the

00:34:59.574 --> 00:35:00.980
testing cold.
 

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.519
And what you see is a gradual
decline in worldwide fallout,

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:09.670
represented by strontium-90 and
cesium-137 in milk.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:13.371
So you see this gradual decline
because of the residency time in

00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:16.847
the atmosphere,
so that these chemicals don't

00:35:16.847 --> 00:35:20.849
all wash out like quickly after
the explosions.

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:23.190
They go into global circulation.
 

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:26.206
And there was great debate at
the time about the amount of

00:35:26.206 --> 00:35:28.429
time that they stayed in the
atmosphere.

00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:30.143
And the Atomic Energy
Commission was arguing,

00:35:30.143 --> 00:35:31.039
don't worry about it.
 

00:35:31.039 --> 00:35:32.818
They're going to stay in the
atmosphere for a long period of

00:35:32.818 --> 00:35:33.030
time.
 

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.559
Why would they use that logic?
 

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:37.673
Well, they wanted the radiation
to dissipate so that by the time

00:35:37.673 --> 00:35:40.541
the nuclides got down to the
ground that they wouldn't pose

00:35:40.541 --> 00:35:42.369
such an intense radiation
threat.

00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:44.630
Now, that's kind of an
interesting story.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.581
So environmentalists and public
health advocates were arguing,

00:35:48.581 --> 00:35:52.079
no, you don't understand this
pattern of deposition.

00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:58.335
It's often more quickly that it
reaches the ground concentrated

00:35:58.335 --> 00:36:02.268
in the higher intensity of
radiation.

00:36:02.268 --> 00:36:08.603
So that this story played out
over the 1970s and 1980s until

00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:14.724
gradually, you find 1995 it
really leveling off to what it

00:36:14.724 --> 00:36:16.119
is today.
 

00:36:16.119 --> 00:36:22.798
Curiously, you see the spike in
cesium-137 in 1987,1986,

00:36:22.798 --> 00:36:23.650
1987.
 

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:25.429
Anybody have any idea what that
might be?

00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:27.500
Student: Chernobyl.
 

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.420
Prof: Chernobyl.
 

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.452
Chernobyl released more
cesium-137 to the atmosphere

00:36:31.452 --> 00:36:35.329
after the explosion,
where the dome of the building

00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:40.099
blew off and there was a fire
that was uncontainable for a

00:36:40.099 --> 00:36:41.690
period of weeks.
 

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:45.150
It spewed more radiation into
the atmosphere in the form of

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.373
cesium-137 than many of the
earlier atmospheric weapons

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:49.210
tests did.
 

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:54.706
So I began by telling you that
under conditions of secrecy,

00:36:54.706 --> 00:37:00.583
the people that hold power over
the secret have great narrative

00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:01.909
advantage.
 

00:37:01.909 --> 00:37:05.094
They not only control the
search for the data,

00:37:05.094 --> 00:37:09.130
they control its interpretation
and they control the story

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:11.820
that's told to the general
public.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:15.306
And a couple of elements of
this story are kind of fun to

00:37:15.306 --> 00:37:17.856
think about,
because we'll see these same

00:37:17.856 --> 00:37:19.880
narratives evolve for
pesticides,

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.092
for plastics,
for a variety of different

00:37:22.092 --> 00:37:23.510
environmental problems.
 

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.452
Is the problem human induced or
is it more important to worry

00:37:28.452 --> 00:37:30.429
about natural sources?
 

00:37:30.429 --> 00:37:33.018
Natural sources of radiation,
hmm.

00:37:33.018 --> 00:37:36.331
So you see these comparisons
between the dose that you would

00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:39.869
get by having a glass of milk or
having the diet of a child,

00:37:39.869 --> 00:37:43.221
a comparison between that and
number of flights that you would

00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:44.980
take across the United States.
 

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.074
And you probably know that you
get a measurable dose of

00:37:48.074 --> 00:37:50.309
radiation when you're up in
aircraft.

00:37:50.309 --> 00:37:53.811
So this comparison between
human-induced exposure compared

00:37:53.811 --> 00:37:56.762
to natural exposure,
another good example of that

00:37:56.762 --> 00:37:57.929
would be radon.
 

00:37:57.929 --> 00:38:00.505
And in Connecticut,
we have a problem with radon

00:38:00.505 --> 00:38:01.875
gas,
which is radioactive,

00:38:01.875 --> 00:38:04.597
being emitted especially from
the kind of rock that we have

00:38:04.597 --> 00:38:06.407
here,
and particularly along the

00:38:06.407 --> 00:38:09.719
coastline heading east down here
along the Long Island Sound.

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:12.373
And my basement in my house,
for example,

00:38:12.373 --> 00:38:15.690
we had a radon problem where
radon gas was not just

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.409
measurable, it was really quite
high.

00:38:18.409 --> 00:38:21.070
So we had to figure out how to
remediate that.

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:24.054
You dig a hole in your basement
floor, you put a little fan and

00:38:24.054 --> 00:38:25.739
a pipe in, and you get rid of
it.

00:38:25.739 --> 00:38:28.952
If you don't do that,
then you risk exposing your

00:38:28.952 --> 00:38:31.764
family to radon,
which is a very well-known

00:38:31.764 --> 00:38:32.768
carcinogen.
 

00:38:32.768 --> 00:38:36.161
The estimates of deaths from
radon exposure in the United

00:38:36.161 --> 00:38:38.159
States are actually quite high.
 

00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:42.306
You know, 40,000 to 50,000
people per year are believed to

00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:45.800
get lung cancer as a result of
radon exposure.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.382
So that the comparison of
natural sources of radiation to

00:38:49.382 --> 00:38:53.539
human-induced sources related to
national security protection,

00:38:53.539 --> 00:38:56.260
there is some legitimacy to
that and you have to be very

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.199
careful about it.
 

00:38:57.199 --> 00:38:59.300
Also, the idea of relative risk.
 

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.132
Well, why are we worrying about
radiation when we should be

00:39:02.132 --> 00:39:03.989
worrying about other kinds of
risks?

00:39:03.989 --> 00:39:05.940
We'll see that with respect to
pesticides,

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.103
where you find,
say, the car manufacturers

00:39:10.103 --> 00:39:15.889
concerned about the emission
technology requirements under

00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:20.460
the Clean Air Act for tailpipe
emissions.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.891
And they point to other
sources, other critical sources

00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:27.449
of human exposure to air
pollutants, such as power plants

00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:28.719
or incinerators.
 

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:33.460
So this idea of risk comparison
really was well honed in the

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.480
1940s and 1950s by the Atomic
Energy Commission.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.483
In that case,
the concern was to express the

00:39:42.483 --> 00:39:46.673
risk relative to
misunderstanding the

00:39:46.673 --> 00:39:53.657
implications of nuclear war and
not being able to protect the

00:39:53.657 --> 00:39:59.360
public from excessive patterns
of exposure.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.509
That played out by the way in a
variety of pretty unusual ways

00:40:03.509 --> 00:40:07.795
so that many people in the 1950s
built fallout shelters in their

00:40:07.795 --> 00:40:08.679
backyard.
 

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:11.440
My neighbors did it,
my family never had the means

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.059
to do it.
 

00:40:12.059 --> 00:40:15.402
But my neighbors had these
concrete buildings that they

00:40:15.402 --> 00:40:16.639
built underground.
 

00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:17.679
They looked a lot like
basements.

00:40:17.679 --> 00:40:20.331
And they would store water and
food and they would practice air

00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:22.639
drills, where they would run
down into the basement.

00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:25.797
And this was especially
important during the Cuban

00:40:25.797 --> 00:40:28.697
Missile Crisis,
where we came the closest that

00:40:28.697 --> 00:40:30.760
we ever have to nuclear war.
 

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:36.235
So the idea of how long do you
have to stay in the shelter to

00:40:36.235 --> 00:40:37.969
protect yourself?
 

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:40.864
Well, you wouldn't know that
unless you had done these

00:40:40.864 --> 00:40:43.213
atmospheric tests and you
understood how the

00:40:43.213 --> 00:40:46.489
concentrations diminished over a
certain period of time.

00:40:46.489 --> 00:40:50.170
So the idea of relative risk
also deserves merit.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.474
This is also an interesting
time when the first

00:40:53.474 --> 00:40:57.713
environmentalists had formed
their organizations back in the

00:40:57.713 --> 00:40:59.150
1940s and 1950s.
 

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.266
They tended to be medical
doctors, the very first

00:41:01.266 --> 00:41:02.150
environmentalists.
 

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.509
And one of the interest groups
that you recognize today is

00:41:05.509 --> 00:41:08.574
Consumers Union that produces
Consumer Reports

00:41:08.574 --> 00:41:12.101
magazine,
it compares product quality and

00:41:12.101 --> 00:41:16.460
often environmental or health
claims of products.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.547
So Consumers Union was very
active in collecting milk,

00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:22.809
in this case from forty-eight
cities around the world.

00:41:22.809 --> 00:41:26.300
No one talked about human milk,
and I found this to be quite

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:27.130
fascinating.
 

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.750
So for the entire decade,
no one spoke about oh,

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:35.219
well, if it's getting into
cow's milk, why isn't it getting

00:41:35.219 --> 00:41:36.760
into human milk?
 

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:39.565
If it's getting into human
milk, what's the capacity to be

00:41:39.565 --> 00:41:42.568
transferring these radionuclides
across generations via breast

00:41:42.568 --> 00:41:43.159
feeding?
 

00:41:43.159 --> 00:41:46.039
Well in part,
I think it was a shyness,

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:49.829
a reluctance to talk about
breastfeeding in public,

00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:52.329
which was common at the time.
 

00:41:52.329 --> 00:41:54.786
But it was clearly an issue
that the Atomic Energy

00:41:54.786 --> 00:41:56.190
Commission had recognized.
 

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:59.454
And I found a document,
it was a document that was

00:41:59.454 --> 00:42:03.518
declassified that was produced
in 1952 that demonstrated quite

00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:07.050
clearly that the Atomic Energy
Commission had made the

00:42:07.050 --> 00:42:08.849
connection like that.
 

00:42:08.849 --> 00:42:11.730
It's in cow's milk,
it's going to be in human milk.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.411
We know that these compounds
are capable of causing mutations

00:42:16.411 --> 00:42:20.780
in genes and some of those
mutations are inheritable,

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.730
they can be transferred across
generations,

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.719
in addition to the fact that
we're exposing the next

00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:29.432
generation via breast milk,
in addition to infant formula

00:42:29.432 --> 00:42:33.405
in milk and other parts of a
small child or an infant's food

00:42:33.405 --> 00:42:34.079
supply.
 

00:42:34.079 --> 00:42:38.014
Also, the group SANE became
famous at this point in time,

00:42:38.014 --> 00:42:41.806
a group that was politically
active to protect pregnant

00:42:41.806 --> 00:42:42.510
women.
 

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.456
And this history is the first
history in the twentieth century

00:42:46.456 --> 00:42:50.275
where children's health became a
logic for a stronger set of

00:42:50.275 --> 00:42:54.289
regulations and rules relative
to emitting something that could

00:42:54.289 --> 00:42:57.590
be thought of as dangerous to
the atmosphere.

00:42:57.590 --> 00:43:03.590
So gradually,
by the end of the decade,

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.172
the Atomic Energy Commission
recognized that strontium-90

00:43:07.172 --> 00:43:10.289
accumulated in soils,
it accumulated in foods,

00:43:10.289 --> 00:43:11.869
it accumulated in kids.
 

00:43:11.869 --> 00:43:14.690
They knew how to calculate what
the cancer risk was because they

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:16.659
understood the dose-response
relationship.

00:43:16.659 --> 00:43:19.896
So they were basically sitting
on a gold mine of knowledge that

00:43:19.896 --> 00:43:22.976
they had kept from the public as
best they could during this

00:43:22.976 --> 00:43:23.969
period of time.
 

00:43:23.969 --> 00:43:27.820
So here's a list of sixty years
of experimentation with nuclear

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.675
weapons, forty-three years,
forty-five years of

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:31.670
negotiation.
 

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.193
And you see the Antarctic
Treaty, the agreement not to

00:43:34.193 --> 00:43:36.050
conduct the testing in the
Antarctic.

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:40.340
This is common heritage for all
of mankind, so to speak.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:42.130
You see the Hotline Agreement.
 

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:46.197
Before a nuclear war was
initiated, there was an

00:43:46.197 --> 00:43:51.735
agreement to call up the Soviets
and try a last-minute attempt at

00:43:51.735 --> 00:43:53.119
negotiation.
 

00:43:53.119 --> 00:43:56.788
The Limited Test Ban Treaty
that I just described,

00:43:56.788 --> 00:43:59.856
the Outer Space Treaty,
the Seabed Treaty,

00:43:59.856 --> 00:44:04.050
it's not legal to conduct
experiments in the seabed.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:08.581
So that common property around
the world is now protected by

00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:10.349
international treaty.
 

00:44:10.349 --> 00:44:15.579
However, the United States is
testing at a rate that has never

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:16.610
been less.
 

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.429
The testing,
however, the majority of it is

00:44:19.429 --> 00:44:20.369
underground.
 

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:24.188
And I'll show you a clip next
week of some underground tests

00:44:24.188 --> 00:44:27.811
that created earthquakes in
different parts of the world,

00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:29.559
particularly in Alaska.
 

00:44:29.559 --> 00:44:33.621
And we also see a very curious
effect where these former

00:44:33.621 --> 00:44:37.534
testing sites were eventually
translated into fish and

00:44:37.534 --> 00:44:39.159
wildlife reserves.
 

00:44:39.159 --> 00:44:42.440
So that's another interesting
thing to try to explain.

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.429
And I'm going to close today
with one more thought for you.

00:44:46.429 --> 00:44:51.300
This entire story unfolded
between 1945 and 1963.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:57.137
The Environmental Protection
Agency was created in 1970 and

00:44:57.137 --> 00:45:02.170
the Safe Drinking Water Act was
created in 1976.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.483
So there was absolutely no
protection, there was no

00:45:04.483 --> 00:45:06.981
monitoring of public water
supplies through this entire

00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:07.860
period of time.
 

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:12.016
The Clean Air Act was not in
existence, so that there was no

00:45:12.016 --> 00:45:15.748
protection against the
radionuclides as air pollutants

00:45:15.748 --> 00:45:17.440
or air contaminants.
 

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.338
And finally,
in 1976, the Environmental

00:45:20.338 --> 00:45:24.456
Protection Agency set an
acceptable radioactivity limit

00:45:24.456 --> 00:45:27.659
for drinking water of 1
millisievert,

00:45:27.659 --> 00:45:30.949
or that can be translated into
0.1 rem per year.

00:45:30.949 --> 00:45:32.860
How about radionuclides in food?
 

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:36.094
One would think that this
history would provide a very

00:45:36.094 --> 00:45:39.389
good logic for establishing
limits for radionuclides in

00:45:39.389 --> 00:45:39.940
food.
 

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:43.001
But as the Chernobyl event in
1986 unfolded,

00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:47.204
we realized that we were not
alone in not having any sort of

00:45:47.204 --> 00:45:49.840
limits for radionuclides in
food.

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.768
Neither did any of the European
Union nations,

00:45:52.768 --> 00:45:56.228
so trade was completely
disrupted, tens of billions of

00:45:56.228 --> 00:45:59.686
dollars of food was lost
following the Chernobyl event

00:45:59.686 --> 00:46:03.929
because Italy had one standard
for acceptable contamination,

00:46:03.929 --> 00:46:05.989
whereas Germany had another.
 

00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:07.960
All the nations had different
standards.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:12.032
But just keep this in mind,
that the United States still

00:46:12.032 --> 00:46:14.699
has no maximum permissible
limits.

00:46:14.699 --> 00:46:17.815
The take-away point here,
simply when secrecy is combined

00:46:17.815 --> 00:46:20.208
with the absence of
environmental and health

00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:22.818
surveillance,
the public opinion and politics

00:46:22.818 --> 00:46:25.360
favor the development of
hazardous technologies.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:28.835
In this case,
this knowledge was controlled

00:46:28.835 --> 00:46:33.304
by elites and then released
selectively to an unknowing

00:46:33.304 --> 00:46:37.112
public in an attempt to
encourage them to favor

00:46:37.112 --> 00:46:40.340
continued atomic weapons
testing.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:46.000

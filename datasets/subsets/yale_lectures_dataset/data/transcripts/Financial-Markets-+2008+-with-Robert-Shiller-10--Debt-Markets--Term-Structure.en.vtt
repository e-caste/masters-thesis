00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.159
Professor Robert Shiller:
Before I begin,

00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:09.466
I just wanted to say that I was
very--I found last period's

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.030
lecture with David Swensen very
interesting.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.911
Also, I liked being serenaded
by New Blue, which is a first

00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:23.005
experience for me.
Swensen--He gave,

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:27.380
I thought, a very interesting
talk.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.220
I've heard him talk before but
it's always interesting.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.710
He really emphasized
diversification.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.109
But, I don't know what you were
thinking, we got a 28% portfolio

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.689
return last year.
There's something else going on

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.886
besides diversification;
diversification means we get

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:51.016
the average return.
And I was glad that you asked

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:54.798
questions at the end.
Some of your questions seemed

00:00:54.798 --> 00:00:59.720
to draw out other things that he
doesn't plan to talk about,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
like what he really did to make
money.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.458
One thing was that he said that
they shorted the Internet stocks

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:10.849
in the late 1990s.
That's a brilliant market

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:15.533
timing device that--I think
enlightened people thought that

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:20.137
those prices were getting
high--and also made some play on

00:01:20.137 --> 00:01:23.610
credit spreads and now on real
estate,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.560
he said.
How does he do it?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.619
Again, it's my theory that
there's no--you can't entirely

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.569
be taught, but partly though I
think that he does it,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:44.089
as do other good portfolio
managers, by just keeping a very

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:47.984
broad base of knowledge and
listening to people and

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:52.114
collecting information and
watching the big trends and

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:55.919
thinking about them.
One of, I think,

00:01:55.919 --> 00:02:01.704
Swensen's best talents is he's
a good listener and he

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:06.709
incorporates basic facts and
acts on them.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.773
You might have--it would be
incorrect, I think,

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:15.897
in listening to what he said
and conclude that he just says

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:21.286
diversify because he's obviously
done something very different

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:24.368
from that.
By the way, I have another

00:02:24.368 --> 00:02:28.091
speaker who told me that he
would like to talk to our class

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:32.205
and I hope we can work it out.
His name is Carl Icahn,

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:37.584
who is one of the biggest Wall
Street--powerful and enlightened

00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:42.617
people on Wall Street--who can
also maybe tell us something

00:02:42.617 --> 00:02:48.169
about how he makes money or how
he makes it a better world.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:51.607
The problem is that he has
a--these people have very tight

00:02:51.607 --> 00:02:55.105
schedules and he's involved in
various takeovers and things

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:59.541
right now.
He said he could do it if we

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:07.109
could arrange to meet after 3:00
p.m., so I'm going to--on a

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:13.010
Monday or a Wednesday,
perhaps at 3:00 p.m.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.227
or later.
He said--his assistant said it

00:03:17.227 --> 00:03:21.270
might even be 7:00 p.m.,
so that's the way he works.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.580
I don't think he gets up at
9:00 a.m., apparently.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.781
So, I take that that's all
right with you--that you can

00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:32.050
come to a special section of
this class.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.080
We would have to see if we can
arrange that.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.086
Again, I don't guarantee that
it will happen because the

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:43.310
reality is, someone who is
involved in as many things as he

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.638
is--it's going to be something.
We do have Stephen Schwarzman

00:03:49.638 --> 00:03:57.717
coming February 22^(nd) and we
have Andrew Redleaf coming March

00:03:57.717 --> 00:04:03.421
5^(th),
so we have a really strong set

00:04:03.421 --> 00:04:10.592
of outside speakers this year.
Again, the mid-term exam is

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:13.615
Monday;
sorry that I misstated that

00:04:13.615 --> 00:04:16.389
last week.
You've already seen last year's

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.330
mid-term and it's going to look
a lot like that.

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:33.069
We're talking today about
interest rates and bonds.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.509
Interest rates are an old,
old thing.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:40.923
They go back to ancient times,
but I'm going to talk about

00:04:40.923 --> 00:04:45.414
some of our modern institutions
and I'm going to talk first

00:04:45.414 --> 00:04:50.040
about discount bonds.
This is a little bit more of a

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.537
technical lecture,
but I find it just as

00:04:53.537 --> 00:04:58.467
interesting myself.
We're talking about discount

00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:04.912
bonds, and then coupon-carrying
bonds, and then talk about the

00:05:04.912 --> 00:05:11.990
term structure of interest rates
and why we have interest rates.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:19.389
I think that's my Blackberry
beeping.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.110
I'm trying not to live in too
electronic a world.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.690
That's the way it is these days.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.231
It's giving its last gasp.
Then finally,

00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:39.139
talk about inflation index
bonds.

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:50.709
The first thing is a discount
bond.

00:05:50.709 --> 00:06:01.781
It's the most simple--or often
called a bill--a discount bond

00:06:01.781 --> 00:06:08.750
does not pay interest;
it's sold at a discount.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:16.310
You have the principle,
which is the amount owed,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:24.347
which is, let's say it's $100,
that will be paid to you at

00:06:24.347 --> 00:06:30.120
some date in the future,
specified in the contract.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.290
And nothing,
you would just get $100.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.435
Effectively,
you get interest from this

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:45.980
because it's sold at a discount,
so the price that you pay is

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.780
equal to one hundred minus the
discount.

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.949
You wouldn't buy this bond at
par because--at par,

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:04.928
meaning at $100--because then
you wouldn't get any interest on

00:07:04.928 --> 00:07:09.965
it.
So you buy it at a discount and

00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:18.896
the return you get is of course
a hundred minus--the return you

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:24.720
get is the discount.
The U.S.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.834
Government is a big issuer of
discount bonds and they're

00:07:28.834 --> 00:07:34.714
called Treasury bills.
I have them up on the screen

00:07:34.714 --> 00:07:37.759
here.
This is from a U.S.

00:07:37.759 --> 00:07:43.816
Government website called
treasurydirect.gov and you can

00:07:43.816 --> 00:07:47.670
get on and access it at any
time.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.044
It is showing--since the U.S.
Government issues these bonds,

00:07:53.044 --> 00:07:56.139
it's showing its data on these
bonds.

00:07:56.139 --> 00:08:03.346
The bonds are auctioned off on
regular dates and you cannot

00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:08.509
participate in the auction;
I assume you can't.

00:08:08.509 --> 00:08:12.168
You'd have to be an authorized
participant, but if you become

00:08:12.168 --> 00:08:15.338
an institution you can get
authorized to trade in the

00:08:15.338 --> 00:08:17.680
auction.
These are the dates;

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.420
the latest auction was February
14^(th).

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:27.189
I guess that was yesterday,
right?

00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:33.289
The term means it was a
sixty-day Treasury bill;

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:38.919
that means it pays not $100,
it would start at $10,000.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.165
Treasury bills--maybe you have
to realize there's a distinction

00:08:43.165 --> 00:08:46.110
between savings bonds and
Treasury bills.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:49.894
Treasury bills are for serious
investors and so they don't come

00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:52.279
in small denominations.
The U.S.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:58.669
Government also issues small
denomination debt to individuals

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:04.526
to help them called savings
bonds, but we aren't talking

00:09:04.526 --> 00:09:08.938
about those.
At the February 14^(th)

00:09:08.938 --> 00:09:15.178
auction, Treasury bills
were--sixty-day treasury bills

00:09:15.178 --> 00:09:20.360
were sold and the auction price
is given.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.230
Well, here's the price of the
bill.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:28.769
The issue date was today,
February 15^(th),

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:35.362
and they mature in what should
be exactly sixty days--on April

00:09:35.362 --> 00:09:36.660
15^(th).

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:47.009
If you want to buy one you
would pay this price.

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:49.476
This number,
CUSIP number,

00:09:49.476 --> 00:09:53.720
is a number that identifies any
security.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.881
It's like you have a social
security number or other ID

00:09:56.881 --> 00:10:00.570
number, which positively--there
might be another person with the

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.553
same name as you,
God forbid, but you at least

00:10:03.553 --> 00:10:06.435
have your own number,
which is guaranteed to be

00:10:06.435 --> 00:10:09.714
unique to you.
So every security has an

00:10:09.714 --> 00:10:13.220
identical CUSIP,
which identifies it.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:21.280
I want to start by explaining
the numbers here.

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:29.520
How did they get--how do these
numbers interrelate?

00:10:34.909 --> 00:10:40.116
Well, the discount rate is sort
of the--you notice there are two

00:10:40.116 --> 00:10:44.826
different interest rates here
and you might be confused by

00:10:44.826 --> 00:10:48.360
them.
The discount rate that is shown

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.850
is the number that you plug into
a formula to get the price.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:59.884
What really matters to you as
an investor is how much you have

00:10:59.884 --> 00:11:03.940
to pay today to get $100 in
sixty days.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.450
So, how do we get the price
from the discount rate?

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:16.587
Well, there's a formula that's
been used by bond traders for

00:11:16.587 --> 00:11:23.120
hundreds of years and it's a
traditional expression,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:27.759
which goes from the discount
rate to the price.

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:33.830
In this case,
price is $99.58 and what does

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:41.681
that equal?
It equals 2.51--that's the

00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:55.690
discount rate that you see up
there--well, (2.510 x 60)/360.

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:01.623
As you know,
the maturity is 60-days and,

00:12:01.623 --> 00:12:07.705
as you know,
there are about 360 days in a

00:12:07.705 --> 00:12:10.713
year.
By tradition,

00:12:10.713 --> 00:12:17.019
they divide by 360,
not 365, and so you understand

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:23.970
that dealers of Treasury bills
tend to "discounts."

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.840
It's like a language,
a language of finance.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:34.821
So what everybody knows is that
the discount is converted into a

00:12:34.821 --> 00:12:40.259
price according to this formula.
You might ask,

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:44.670
well is this an approximate
formula?

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.428
No, it's an exact formula.
Then you say,

00:12:47.428 --> 00:12:52.368
well why didn't they divide by
365, because I know there are

00:12:52.368 --> 00:12:56.667
365 days in a year?
The answer is--this goes way

00:12:56.667 --> 00:13:02.107
back--it's an old tradition and
they used to have to do this by

00:13:02.107 --> 00:13:05.055
hand.
They had to divide by hand and

00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:08.874
so they didn't like the number
365, so they thought,

00:13:08.874 --> 00:13:12.570
let's just round it to 360.
As long as everybody knows

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.527
that's what we're doing,
what difference does it make,

00:13:15.527 --> 00:13:18.304
right?
That's what you're supposed to

00:13:18.304 --> 00:13:20.402
know.
If your dealer quotes you a

00:13:20.402 --> 00:13:23.505
discount rate of 2.51%,
you know how to convert that

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:27.034
into the price and that's all
that matters--all that really

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:29.590
matters is the price you have to
pay.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:38.430
They also have something up
here called the investment rate.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.468
Yes?
Student: I'm sorry,

00:13:40.468 --> 00:13:43.504
I don't understand since the
left hand side of your equation

00:13:43.504 --> 00:13:45.460
does not equal the right hand
side,

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.202
isn't that discount, not price?
Professor Robert

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:53.895
Shiller: I'm sorry,
glad you--that's the difference

00:13:53.895 --> 00:14:02.291
between 1 and 99.58.
Yes, thank you--between 100 and

00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:03.640
99.58.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.576
Are you okay now?
I'm sorry I made a--now the

00:14:27.576 --> 00:14:30.929
thing is, to convert that
into--what is this

00:14:30.929 --> 00:14:35.142
other--there's another interest
rate up here called the

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:39.217
investment rate.
Well, that's supposed to be

00:14:39.217 --> 00:14:43.460
your percentage return on an
annualized basis.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.985
Remember, this thing only runs
for sixty days and you could

00:14:46.985 --> 00:14:50.611
compute your sixty-day return,
but people like to compare

00:14:50.611 --> 00:14:53.779
annual returns--once again,
a tradition we have.

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:56.847
Now, there's nothing special
about annual--that's the time it

00:14:56.847 --> 00:14:58.789
take the Earth to go around the
sun,

00:14:58.789 --> 00:15:02.146
but it doesn't have any
relevance to finance--but we are

00:15:02.146 --> 00:15:06.538
just accustomed to using that.
What we're going to do,

00:15:06.538 --> 00:15:11.309
however, is take account of
another problem.

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:21.673
That is, you might think that
this quantity here is my return

00:15:21.673 --> 00:15:30.309
but you have to actually divide
it by the price,

00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:33.340
which is less than a hundred,
to get a return.

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:37.159
You're not putting in $100 to
this investment;

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:41.610
you're putting in $99.58 for
the investment and you're

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:46.059
getting out the difference
between $100 and $99.58.

00:15:46.059 --> 00:15:54.572
So, that is not--your return is
actually higher than 2.51% on an

00:15:54.572 --> 00:15:59.588
annualized basis.
What we do--I'll show you how

00:15:59.588 --> 00:16:01.530
they got their number.

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:15.744
2.563%, which is the number you
see under investment rate,

00:16:15.744 --> 00:16:24.961
is equal to 1/(.9958 –
1), corrected for the number of

00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:27.930
days in a year.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:38.448
How do we do that correction?
When I first tried this,

00:16:38.448 --> 00:16:45.345
I thought, fine I'll multiply
by 365/60, but I forgot this is

00:16:45.345 --> 00:16:53.840
a leap year.
So, times 366/60.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:17:03.357
So, that's how you go from the
discount rate to the investment

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.085
rate.
Do you understand why we had to

00:17:06.085 --> 00:17:08.733
do this?
The investment rate is telling

00:17:08.733 --> 00:17:13.223
you how much money you're really
making on an annualized basis,

00:17:13.223 --> 00:17:19.514
so it's very simple.
I put in .9958 for every dollar

00:17:19.514 --> 00:17:27.569
I got out, so my appreciation of
my money is 1/.9958.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.687
Subtract that by $1,
which is what I put in,

00:17:30.687 --> 00:17:35.109
and that's how much money I
made as a fraction of a dollar.

00:17:35.109 --> 00:17:40.242
All I have to do then is
correct that for the number of

00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:43.950
days in a year,
so that's what I did.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:49.176
That's how we go from the
discount rate to the investment

00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:51.256
rate.
Now you might ask,

00:17:51.256 --> 00:17:55.456
well if we did 360 here,
why don't we just do 360 over

00:17:55.456 --> 00:17:57.692
here?
Well, it's one of the mysteries

00:17:57.692 --> 00:18:00.006
of Wall Street.
They like to--when they're

00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:03.265
computing the investment yield,
they want to be completely

00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:05.609
honest and not use any rules of
thumb.

00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:08.752
So you have to understand that
it's 360 a year because that's

00:18:08.752 --> 00:18:11.999
just a convention and everybody
knows that it's just the way we

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:14.926
quote prices.
Rather than say $99.58,

00:18:14.926 --> 00:18:20.150
we just quote the 2.51 and
everybody knows how to convert.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.637
When you ask for the investment
rate, you want to know the

00:18:22.637 --> 00:18:25.081
truth--how much am I really
getting--so they don't monkey

00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:26.843
around here.
Also, they don't have to

00:18:26.843 --> 00:18:29.236
actually--in the old days,
they didn't actually have to

00:18:29.236 --> 00:18:32.170
compute the investment rate.
If you were talking to your

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.521
broker--if you go really old
days, you'd send a boy running

00:18:35.521 --> 00:18:38.140
over to your broker.
They didn't have telephones;

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.656
they used to have runners.
The boy would go say,

00:18:41.656 --> 00:18:46.276
we're offering to pay a
discount rate of 2.51--that was

00:18:46.276 --> 00:18:51.410
the formula--and then anyone
could do these calculations;

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:56.399
they knew what it meant.
This calculation wasn't done

00:18:56.399 --> 00:19:00.047
very frequently;
that's just if you had one of

00:19:00.047 --> 00:19:03.240
the satisfactions of knowing how
much money you were making.

00:19:12.779 --> 00:19:15.610
I think we pretty much
explained--there's another thing

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.549
I want to say about Treasury
bills.

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:21.946
I used to have up here a
page--I used to take--instead of

00:19:21.946 --> 00:19:24.930
Treasury Direct,
which is a website,

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.992
I used to get a clipping from
The Wall Street Journal

00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:30.950
that showed much the same
information that you see on this

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.986
chart.
But, it showed additional

00:19:32.986 --> 00:19:36.140
information that you won't find
on Treasury Direct;

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.019
it showed bid and ask for
dealers.

00:19:40.019 --> 00:19:43.444
Now, you have to understand
that the Treasury has these

00:19:43.444 --> 00:19:46.748
auctions only on these dates.
On February 14^(th),

00:19:46.748 --> 00:19:49.759
they only sold sixty-day ones,
nothing else.

00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:54.878
On February 11^(th) they sold
only thirteen-week ones and

00:19:54.878 --> 00:19:58.431
nothing else.
What if you want to buy a

00:19:58.431 --> 00:20:02.918
Treasury bill on some other day?
Well, you can go to Treasury

00:20:02.918 --> 00:20:05.619
Direct as an individual and buy
a Treasury bill,

00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:08.089
but it may not be the best
place to buy.

00:20:08.089 --> 00:20:12.581
What you normally do is you go
to a dealer and a dealer is

00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:16.974
someone, a professional,
who participated in the auction

00:20:16.974 --> 00:20:20.983
and bought these up to
accumulate an inventory to then

00:20:20.983 --> 00:20:23.349
sell off to you,
the customer.

00:20:23.349 --> 00:20:25.744
So normally,
you don't deal with Treasury

00:20:25.744 --> 00:20:29.936
Direct, you deal with a dealer.
The Wall Street Journal

00:20:29.936 --> 00:20:34.073
calls around to the dealer,
which has an inventory of all

00:20:34.073 --> 00:20:38.210
these maturities and asks them
for their bid and ask.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:43.283
And a dealer--what a dealer
does is it maintains an

00:20:43.283 --> 00:20:45.921
inventory of,
in this case,

00:20:45.921 --> 00:20:52.009
Treasury bills and then it
stands ready to buy and sell.

00:20:52.009 --> 00:20:55.900
So, the bid price is the--they
don't do it in terms of price,

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.207
they do it in terms of
discount--so the bid discount

00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:02.190
rate--there would be two numbers
for each.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.667
One is the bid,
which is what they'll pay you

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:09.619
for a Treasury bill if you want
to sell to them.

00:21:09.619 --> 00:21:15.319
The ask is what you have to pay
them through this formula.

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:23.843
The formula is--I could write
it this way: price equals one

00:21:23.843 --> 00:21:29.630
hundred minus this.
Normally, when you have a

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:36.001
dealer, the dealer has a--when
we talk in terms of price the

00:21:36.001 --> 00:21:41.509
dealer has an ask,
which is higher than the bid.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.612
If you go to an antique
dealer--maybe you're familiar or

00:21:44.612 --> 00:21:47.827
maybe you've done this if you've
bought furniture for some

00:21:47.827 --> 00:21:52.049
apartment or something.
The dealer will charge a higher

00:21:52.049 --> 00:21:56.840
price for you to buy the
furniture than will give to you

00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:00.150
to purchase the furniture from
you;

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:02.240
that's how the dealer makes a
difference.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.499
The difference between bid and
ask is the profit for the dealer

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:10.210
and the bid-ask spread is the
profit for the dealer.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:14.521
You can see these--you can see
the bid and ask in The Wall

00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:18.099
Street Journal.
It's interesting to look at it

00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:20.859
because you note that the
bid-ask spread,

00:22:20.859 --> 00:22:24.862
which is the difference between
the bid and the ask for the

00:22:24.862 --> 00:22:28.108
dealer,
is narrower in the more liquid

00:22:28.108 --> 00:22:32.543
securities and some of the
securities that are small and

00:22:32.543 --> 00:22:35.930
unimportant have a wide bid-ask
spread.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.677
That means that it's harder to
make a market for it,

00:22:38.677 --> 00:22:40.670
so the dealer wants to charge
more.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:46.094
This doesn't show this here.
Unfortunately,

00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:50.022
The Wall Street Journal
stopped carrying this and I

00:22:50.022 --> 00:22:53.950
thought--it's an interesting
story about what goes on.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.912
The Wall Street Journal
is the most influential

00:22:58.912 --> 00:23:04.343
financial publication in this
country but it has been going

00:23:04.343 --> 00:23:09.680
through financial difficulties
with the Internet age.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.958
In the last five years,
the stock in Dow Jones Company

00:23:14.958 --> 00:23:18.809
has fallen by half.
What's happening?

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:22.699
Well, there are many factors,
but one important factor is,

00:23:22.699 --> 00:23:26.588
the rise of the Internet has
competed with--people used to

00:23:26.588 --> 00:23:29.999
buy The Wall Street
Journal to get data like

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:32.225
this.
You see how I completely

00:23:32.225 --> 00:23:35.422
bypassed The Wall Street
Journal and I went to

00:23:35.422 --> 00:23:38.842
Treasury Direct?
There are a million websites

00:23:38.842 --> 00:23:43.829
that give away financial data so
The Wall Street Journal

00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:48.582
was not doing as well.
Do you know what happened

00:23:48.582 --> 00:23:52.069
finally?
I'll give this as an aside;

00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:58.990
they reduced the size of the
newspaper in 2005.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.554
It used to be a big,
broad sheet and they made it

00:24:01.554 --> 00:24:04.439
smaller in 2005 and they
started--they keep cutting out

00:24:04.439 --> 00:24:06.631
data.
There's less and less data in

00:24:06.631 --> 00:24:09.382
The Wall Street Journal.
It used to be this big,

00:24:09.382 --> 00:24:11.557
thick thing and you would go
there everyday to look up--and

00:24:11.557 --> 00:24:14.757
everything was in there.
But now, the Web is competing

00:24:14.757 --> 00:24:19.584
with it, so they're scaling down
the size of the paper and trying

00:24:19.584 --> 00:24:23.427
to survive.
So, they created Wall Street

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:26.664
Journal Online,
which is WSJ.com,

00:24:26.664 --> 00:24:31.160
and they were trying to make
money off of that,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.980
but people weren't willing to
pay for it.

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.367
You know how it is on the Web?
You can get so much for free,

00:24:36.367 --> 00:24:40.606
why should I pay for WSJ.com?
That wasn't working well,

00:24:40.606 --> 00:24:44.458
so last year--about one year
ago--they announced,

00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:48.872
wallstreetjournal.com is
absolutely free and we're going

00:24:48.872 --> 00:24:52.706
to give away all the data,
basically all the data that

00:24:52.706 --> 00:24:54.950
used to be in the newspaper,
free to anyone.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:58.982
I thought that was great.
Now we can all get The Wall

00:24:58.982 --> 00:25:01.450
Street Journal without
paying for it.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.480
There's some problem with that;
it's not economic,

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.458
so let's not be too jubilant.
What ended up happening is,

00:25:09.458 --> 00:25:13.680
you know the news,
Rupert Murdoch bought The

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:19.095
Wall Street Journal last
fall and he announced that Wall

00:25:19.095 --> 00:25:23.960
Street Journal--WSJ.com--will no
longer be free.

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.529
So, this is the reality of the
world.

00:25:26.529 --> 00:25:32.454
I thought it was interesting to
look at Rupert Murdoch--this is

00:25:32.454 --> 00:25:34.806
finance.
This may sound like an aside,

00:25:34.806 --> 00:25:37.232
but this is all finance.
Rupert Murdoch,

00:25:37.232 --> 00:25:41.717
you may have heard of him,
is a huge newspaper baron who

00:25:41.717 --> 00:25:45.059
buys up newspapers all over the
world.

00:25:45.059 --> 00:25:48.945
It's interesting,
he's been at it--he's

00:25:48.945 --> 00:25:53.613
continuing what his father did.
To become the biggest

00:25:53.613 --> 00:25:57.124
publishing monolith in the
world, it takes maybe a hundred

00:25:57.124 --> 00:26:00.204
years, so his father in
Australia started buying up

00:26:00.204 --> 00:26:04.313
newspapers.
His father was born in 1886 and

00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:07.740
now Rupert Murdoch is
continuing.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.418
Rupert Murdoch is in his 70s
and he's still buying

00:26:12.418 --> 00:26:15.977
newspapers.
He kind of makes them survive

00:26:15.977 --> 00:26:19.253
and NewsCorp doubled its
price--that's his

00:26:19.253 --> 00:26:22.690
company--doubled in the last
five years.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.497
You can see,
this is how the unseen rule of

00:26:25.497 --> 00:26:29.040
finance--The Wall Street
Journal is a venerable

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.650
newspaper and source of
information about finance,

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:35.611
but it's not making money.
The world is changing and

00:26:35.611 --> 00:26:37.849
The Wall Street Journal
is flagging.

00:26:37.849 --> 00:26:40.363
So NewsCorp,
whose price doubled when The

00:26:40.363 --> 00:26:42.759
Wall Street Journal's fell
in half,

00:26:42.759 --> 00:26:47.304
eats up and The Wall Street
Journal is gobbled up by the

00:26:47.304 --> 00:26:50.968
bigger company.
You can see why stock prices

00:26:50.968 --> 00:26:53.728
matter.
The Newscorp's rising stock

00:26:53.728 --> 00:26:58.019
price was a sign that Rupert
Murdoch had some idea how to

00:26:58.019 --> 00:27:02.463
make money and The Wall
Street Journal was not doing

00:27:02.463 --> 00:27:04.869
as well,
so it got gobbled up.

00:27:04.869 --> 00:27:08.244
The question is,
what will happen to The Wall

00:27:08.244 --> 00:27:15.490
Street Journal now?
Well, they have to make money;

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.205
that's the real world.
So Rupert Murdoch tends to

00:27:18.205 --> 00:27:21.467
bring papers around.
I'm just going to go a little

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:24.744
bit further on--Rupert Murdoch
bought The Times of

00:27:24.744 --> 00:27:28.210
London in 1981--that was
twenty-seven years ago.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.653
The Times of London is
one of the most venerable

00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:35.160
newspapers in the world and it
was losing money fast;

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.950
it might have disappeared if
Murdoch hadn't taken over.

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:43.380
But, Murdoch turned it around
and it's still around.

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.647
They turned it into a tabloid.
It was the most dignified

00:27:46.647 --> 00:27:49.923
newspaper in the world and he
kind of decided that,

00:27:49.923 --> 00:27:53.067
in order to survive,
they had to get a little bit

00:27:53.067 --> 00:27:56.395
more down to earth.
So, they reduced the size,

00:27:56.395 --> 00:27:59.906
so it looks like one of
those--like New York Daily

00:27:59.906 --> 00:28:03.990
News newspapers now.
It's still a great newspaper.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.721
He added celebrity gossip too,
which The London

00:28:07.721 --> 00:28:10.320
Times would never do in the
past.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.795
But you go to do it, right?
That's the thing about the real

00:28:13.795 --> 00:28:16.710
world and finance is very much
about the real world.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.510
Murdoch claims he will not
alter the editorial content of

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.377
The Wall Street Journal.
The thing that we have seen him

00:28:24.377 --> 00:28:27.160
doing is charging more,
but I guess we've got to allow

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.324
that.
So we may feel annoyed that we

00:28:29.324 --> 00:28:32.115
now have to pay to get our
Wall Street Journal

00:28:32.115 --> 00:28:34.728
Online.
In the long run,

00:28:34.728 --> 00:28:40.571
we want The Wall Street
Journal and so I guess

00:28:40.571 --> 00:28:44.730
that--we just have to accept
that.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:48.326
If you want to find--by the
way, if you want to read The

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:51.736
Wall Street Journal online
at Yale, you can do it no

00:28:51.736 --> 00:28:53.679
problem.
You go to ABI Inform,

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:56.534
which is one of the things that
Yale subscribes to,

00:28:56.534 --> 00:28:59.903
on your laptop and it puts you
right into the text of The

00:28:59.903 --> 00:29:02.777
Wall Street Journal.
But it doesn't put you,

00:29:02.777 --> 00:29:05.318
as far as I can tell,
into Wall Street Journal

00:29:05.318 --> 00:29:08.214
Online.
We have other--lots of data

00:29:08.214 --> 00:29:13.242
sources--that Yale subscribes to
and there are lots of free data

00:29:13.242 --> 00:29:15.539
sources,
but Wall Street Journal

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:19.288
Online is not free.
Anyway, I want to talk--you

00:29:19.288 --> 00:29:22.630
understand now about discount
bonds?

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.962
It's pretty simple, right?
I just wanted to get the

00:29:25.962 --> 00:29:28.833
pricing formula.
The critical thing about a

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:31.059
discount bond is it pays no
interest.

00:29:31.059 --> 00:29:36.633
Treasury bills in the United
States are limited to one year

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:38.859
out;
well, that's the name of it.

00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:44.779
We call an instrument of the
U.S.

00:29:44.779 --> 00:29:49.626
Treasury with a maturity less
than or equal to one year--we

00:29:49.626 --> 00:29:54.639
call that a bill--and they used
to be the only discount bonds

00:29:54.639 --> 00:29:57.480
issued by the U.S.
Government.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:02.257
Now, they also have longer
maturity, called Treasury

00:30:02.257 --> 00:30:05.910
strips, but let me move to the
other.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:10.434
So we have--U.S.
Government issues bills and

00:30:10.434 --> 00:30:16.420
that's less than or equal to one
year and they pay no interest.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:21.161
They also have
government-issued notes and

00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:27.058
that's from one to ten years and
bonds--this is just

00:30:27.058 --> 00:30:35.289
jargon--these are ten or more,
well actually more than ten.

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:42.173
I'll show you from Treasury
Direct--I have notes--this

00:30:42.173 --> 00:30:50.595
should be greater than ten.
These are the recent auctions

00:30:50.595 --> 00:30:57.089
of the Treasury of notes.
Now, these are different from

00:30:57.089 --> 00:31:01.170
bills, as I emphasized,
because they pay interest.

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:03.320
They carry what's called a
coupon.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:14.751
And then we have the bonds.
You see there aren't as many of

00:31:14.751 --> 00:31:17.120
these issued.
We issue a lot of–there

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.899
are a lot of auctions of
Treasury bills and there are

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:21.610
comparatively fewer of bonds.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:37.256
So, let's talk about a bond.
A bond differs from a bill in

00:31:37.256 --> 00:31:44.673
that it carries what's called a
coupon, which I will denote by

00:31:44.673 --> 00:31:51.960
the letter C,
and it has a principal,

00:31:51.960 --> 00:32:00.940
which it pays out at the
end--of one hundred.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:05.273
Of course, there would be
larger denominations than $100,

00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:08.677
but by tradition,
we speak of them as if they

00:32:08.677 --> 00:32:11.849
were bonds that you paid $100 to
get.

00:32:11.849 --> 00:32:21.321
Now, another Wall Street
tradition is that bonds pay a

00:32:21.321 --> 00:32:28.894
coupon;
they pay C/2 every six

00:32:28.894 --> 00:32:30.540
months.

00:32:35.849 --> 00:32:38.480
The coupon is expressed as an
annual amount;

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.059
you get half of it every six
months.

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:45.612
The reason they call them
coupons is that,

00:32:45.612 --> 00:32:50.721
in the old days,
you used to actually--when you

00:32:50.721 --> 00:32:54.542
bought a bond,
there would be a piece of paper

00:32:54.542 --> 00:32:57.835
and the piece of paper would
have attached to it a lot of

00:32:57.835 --> 00:33:00.069
little coupons that you would
clip.

00:33:00.069 --> 00:33:04.052
If it was a twenty-year bond,
there would be forty coupons,

00:33:04.052 --> 00:33:08.173
one for each six-month period,
and each one would have a date

00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:10.119
on it.
What you used to do is,

00:33:10.119 --> 00:33:13.403
every six months you'd pull out
your bonds and you'd clip the

00:33:13.403 --> 00:33:17.425
coupons with a pair of scissors;
you take them to a bank and

00:33:17.425 --> 00:33:20.779
they would give you cash for
your coupons.

00:33:20.779 --> 00:33:24.844
So, we still call them coupons,
but now we don't do it--we do

00:33:24.844 --> 00:33:27.931
things electronically.
You don't have to clip coupons

00:33:27.931 --> 00:33:30.647
anymore.
If you want to see bonds as

00:33:30.647 --> 00:33:33.767
they used to look,
with their coupons,

00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:38.574
there are a number of them at
the International Center for

00:33:38.574 --> 00:33:42.960
Finance down the street here
with their coupons still

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:46.123
attached.
So they've got a lot of--Will

00:33:46.123 --> 00:33:50.000
Goetzmann and Geert Rouwenhorst
are collectors of old bonds and

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.940
they've got lots of bonds with
their coupons still attached.

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:56.461
You know what that means when
they're framed there on the wall

00:33:56.461 --> 00:33:57.950
with their coupons still
attached?

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:01.109
It means the company went
bankrupt and never paid;

00:34:01.109 --> 00:34:03.869
otherwise, the coupons would
have been clipped.

00:34:03.869 --> 00:34:07.761
It's actually--our
International Center for Finance

00:34:07.761 --> 00:34:11.030
is sort of a museum for
defaulted bonds.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:14.488
The ones that are beautiful for
framing are the ones that

00:34:14.488 --> 00:34:17.019
failed, so you can see all the
coupons.

00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:19.920
Some of them have some of the
coupons clipped and then they

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.670
stop and you know that it was
bad news when they stopped

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.820
clipping them.
We still call them coupons.

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:32.031
If you have a bond with an
interest rate of 4.375%--that's

00:34:32.031 --> 00:34:38.352
not an easy one to divide by
two--but you would get half of

00:34:38.352 --> 00:34:42.820
that every six months until
maturity.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:49.863
We have to ask then,
how do we get the price and the

00:34:49.863 --> 00:34:52.350
yield from this?

00:34:55.489 --> 00:34:58.427
What we do is we take the
interest rate,

00:34:58.427 --> 00:35:02.570
which I'll call r,
and plug it into a formula,

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:11.643
which I didn't actually do the
arithmetic to check--to check

00:35:11.643 --> 00:35:19.252
their number.
The price is just the present

00:35:19.252 --> 00:35:28.760
value of the coupons at the
interest rate r,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:36.144
so the price of a bond is the
present discounted value of

00:35:36.144 --> 00:35:45.020
coupons and principal,
at rate r.

00:35:48.969 --> 00:35:51.799
Now, you have to understand
that when you buy a bond,

00:35:51.799 --> 00:35:55.283
if you buy it at issue,
you get the first coupon in six

00:35:55.283 --> 00:35:59.188
months, the second coupon in one
year, the third coupon in

00:35:59.188 --> 00:36:03.269
eighteen months,
and the last coupon you get at

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:07.110
the maturity date.
So that means--what is the

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.363
stream of payments?
You get C/2 in six

00:36:11.363 --> 00:36:17.093
months, C/2 again in a
year, C/2 again in

00:36:17.093 --> 00:36:23.388
eighteen months,
and that continues until the

00:36:23.388 --> 00:36:31.639
last date--the maturity
date--when you get 100 + C/2.

00:36:31.639 --> 00:36:38.401
The price is just the present
value of that stream,

00:36:38.401 --> 00:36:43.000
discounted at the interest
rate.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:37:03.370
The formula can also be written
and expanded out--P =

00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:20.606
(c/2) x
[(1/(r/2)--which is the

00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:34.459
consol formula,
if this were applied to an

00:37:34.459 --> 00:37:45.306
infinite stream-- -
1/(1+(r/2))^(2T) x

00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:57.811
1/(r/2)].
Let me make sure I've got this

00:37:57.811 --> 00:38:07.980
right-- +100
(1/(1+(r/2))^(2T).

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.868
This should be obvious--if I
did that right--this should be

00:38:11.868 --> 00:38:16.159
obvious from what you learned
about in present value formulas.

00:38:16.159 --> 00:38:21.371
If you had a perpetuity,
which paid C/2 forever,

00:38:21.371 --> 00:38:26.390
you already know from the
perpetuity formula that the

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:31.602
value of that would be
C/2 divided by r/2

00:38:31.602 --> 00:38:35.559
if r/2 is the discount
rate.

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:42.551
It's not forever because it
terminates after 2T periods of

00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:48.862
six-month interval each.
You want to subtract off the

00:38:48.862 --> 00:38:53.545
value of a perpetuity that
starts after 2T,

00:38:53.545 --> 00:38:59.387
six-month intervals,
so this is the present value of

00:38:59.387 --> 00:39:05.519
the perpetuity that starts after
2T, six-month intervals.

00:39:05.519 --> 00:39:09.908
Then you want to add the
present value of the principal

00:39:09.908 --> 00:39:14.681
and that's the formula.
That's another conventional

00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:21.080
formula that goes from interest
rate to price of the security.

00:39:39.309 --> 00:39:45.098
Now, I want to talk about the
term structure of interest rates

00:39:45.098 --> 00:39:51.722
and that's my next plot here.
That's the term structure as of

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:59.878
now on the chart.
We've identified the prices and

00:39:59.878 --> 00:40:07.449
yields of bonds of various
maturities.

00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:15.269
How do the prices and yields
look at various points in time?

00:40:15.269 --> 00:40:18.929
So, I've got here a term
structure;

00:40:18.929 --> 00:40:26.911
well, the term structure is the
plot of yield-to-maturity

00:40:26.911 --> 00:40:33.049
against time-to-maturity.
This is January of this year,

00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:37.313
before the Fed cut interest
rates, and this is the term

00:40:37.313 --> 00:40:40.476
structure.
I've got the Federal Funds

00:40:40.476 --> 00:40:45.652
Rate--it's the shortest interest
rate, an overnight rate--it was

00:40:45.652 --> 00:40:50.090
at 4% at that time and then
there was a sharp drop.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:53.608
The three-month Treasury bill
rate is shown there--it was much

00:40:53.608 --> 00:40:57.564
lower--it was under 3%.
Then the--so the term structure

00:40:57.564 --> 00:41:02.755
was downward-sloping until about
two and a half years and then it

00:41:02.755 --> 00:41:06.409
was upward sloping.
The interesting question from

00:41:06.409 --> 00:41:10.083
the standpoint of economic
theory is, why did it have that

00:41:10.083 --> 00:41:15.123
funny shape?
I want to compare it with other

00:41:15.123 --> 00:41:20.510
examples of the term structure
recently.

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:25.891
This is the term structure just
a short while ago--of December

00:41:25.891 --> 00:41:30.926
2006--very different.
The Federal Funds Rate was 5.5%

00:41:30.926 --> 00:41:36.065
and then the whole term
structure--all the way--almost

00:41:36.065 --> 00:41:39.781
all the way.
Well, there's this funny glitch

00:41:39.781 --> 00:41:43.719
here between three-month and
one-year, but then it just

00:41:43.719 --> 00:41:46.653
continued to decline.
That's a strongly

00:41:46.653 --> 00:41:51.173
downward-sloping term structure.
This is another example,

00:41:51.173 --> 00:41:54.880
not so long ago--this is
December 2003.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.087
Now, the term structure was
pretty much upward-sloping

00:41:59.087 --> 00:42:01.222
everywhere.
At that time,

00:42:01.222 --> 00:42:04.952
the Fed had cut the Federal
Funds Rate to 1%,

00:42:04.952 --> 00:42:09.880
we had very low short rates.
And the three-month Treasury

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.920
bill rate was about the same,
at 1%.

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.658
Going further out,
the term structure just kept

00:42:16.658 --> 00:42:19.301
rising.
It's one of the questions of

00:42:19.301 --> 00:42:22.510
economics--what determines the
term structure?

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:25.849
You have to understand that
it's determined in the market.

00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:30.580
The Fed has these auctions but
it auctions them off at what

00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:34.984
price the public will pay,
so the Fed doesn't determine

00:42:34.984 --> 00:42:38.146
the term structure.
Neither do the dealers

00:42:38.146 --> 00:42:41.610
determine the term structure;
the dealers have to buy and

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.079
sell at prices that are in the
market.

00:42:44.079 --> 00:42:47.373
It has to stay relevant to the
market, so nobody really knows

00:42:47.373 --> 00:42:50.776
where these interest rates come
from because no one person sets

00:42:50.776 --> 00:42:52.514
them.
If you're a dealer,

00:42:52.514 --> 00:42:55.329
you've got to keep your bid-ask
at market;

00:42:55.329 --> 00:42:58.407
otherwise, you'll get only one
side or the other,

00:42:58.407 --> 00:43:00.926
right?
You'll be selling too cheaply

00:43:00.926 --> 00:43:04.576
or you'll be buying too dearly.
You've got to do it so you're

00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:06.954
right in the middle,
so that the market is in the

00:43:06.954 --> 00:43:09.420
middle.
Nobody really sees the reason

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.158
for this;
it's all a question of theory,

00:43:13.158 --> 00:43:17.949
so we have to think a little
bit about theory.

00:43:17.949 --> 00:43:23.791
The term structure is one of
the most interesting things in

00:43:23.791 --> 00:43:29.229
economics because it shows the
price of time at various

00:43:29.229 --> 00:43:34.867
maturities.
In 2003, time was almost free

00:43:34.867 --> 00:43:39.092
out three months.
It didn't--if you needed more

00:43:39.092 --> 00:43:42.016
time to get some business done
you'd have to borrow,

00:43:42.016 --> 00:43:44.309
but you'd only have to pay 1% a
year.

00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:48.796
That would be like a quarter of
1% to postpone your payment by

00:43:48.796 --> 00:43:51.699
another year;
so time was really cheap.

00:43:51.699 --> 00:43:55.695
But if you wanted to postpone
it over seven years or so,

00:43:55.695 --> 00:44:00.146
time got a lot more expensive.
Why is this and why is the

00:44:00.146 --> 00:44:06.282
price of time changing?
One thing to do is to go back

00:44:06.282 --> 00:44:13.619
and ask, what really are the
reasons for interest?

00:44:13.619 --> 00:44:22.360
I wanted to talk about the
theory of interest as presented

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:31.406
by Professor Irving Fisher at
Yale, who is famous for having

00:44:31.406 --> 00:44:37.459
exposited that.
I imagine he did it at this

00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:43.854
very blackboard because,
as I said, he had his office in

00:44:43.854 --> 00:44:49.320
this building and he didn't die
until 1940s,

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.679
so he must have been--this
building was--this room goes

00:44:51.679 --> 00:44:54.122
back to the '30s.
He had a diagram,

00:44:54.122 --> 00:44:59.434
which illustrated what is the
ultimate cause of interest,

00:44:59.434 --> 00:45:05.220
and it helps us to think about
this diagram whenever we try to

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:14.034
understand the term structure.
What his diagram--this is the

00:45:14.034 --> 00:45:21.234
famous Irving Fisher
diagram--depicted,

00:45:21.234 --> 00:45:29.750
there's only one period;
there's today on this axis and

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:34.849
tomorrow–well,
I shouldn't say tomorrow,

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:40.630
that suggests one day--next
period on this axis.

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:46.838
Let's say it's one year and I'm
going to actually plot on this

00:45:46.838 --> 00:45:50.400
axis a person's income this
year.

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:59.723
I should say income today on
this axis and on this,

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:05.626
income next period.
So for each person,

00:46:05.626 --> 00:46:11.691
there is a point representing
my income today and my income

00:46:11.691 --> 00:46:14.559
next period.
Let's assume that I know what

00:46:14.559 --> 00:46:17.344
I'm earning next year;
there is actually uncertainty

00:46:17.344 --> 00:46:20.933
about it.
If I draw this down this--this

00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:27.299
point is this year's income down
here and this point here is next

00:46:27.299 --> 00:46:33.969
year's income;
I'll use Y for income.

00:46:33.969 --> 00:46:37.780
This is Y today and this
is Y next period.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:43.058
A person has a budget
constraint if the person can

00:46:43.058 --> 00:46:47.260
borrow and lend at the interest
rate.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:55.966
The budget constraint is a
straight line through this point

00:46:55.966 --> 00:47:01.970
with a slope of (1+r).
I'll try to draw this line.

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:09.623
That should be a straight line.
It doesn't look that straight

00:47:09.623 --> 00:47:11.570
because I was running out of
room up here.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:19.288
You see, that's a straight line.
This point here then is the

00:47:19.288 --> 00:47:29.087
present value of your income;
it's (Y _today

00:47:29.087 --> 00:47:36.060
+ Y _next
period) / (1 + r).

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:43.982
What's this point up here?
This point up here is the

00:47:43.982 --> 00:47:52.320
terminal value of my income,
so the upper point is (Y

00:47:52.320 --> 00:48:01.929
_today *(1 + r)
+ Y _next year.

00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:05.532
In an ideal world,
where you can borrow and lend

00:48:05.532 --> 00:48:09.747
freely, an individual could
choose consumption along any

00:48:09.747 --> 00:48:13.179
point on this line.
I could consume all of my

00:48:13.179 --> 00:48:16.117
income--if I borrow against my
future income,

00:48:16.117 --> 00:48:19.389
I could--there's a problem here
of starvation.

00:48:19.389 --> 00:48:22.630
If I consume it all this year,
I will be starving.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:25.420
I don't see how I can earn
income next year but,

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.210
in principle,
that's what Irving Fisher said.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.104
Well, I could just not consume
anything this year and I could

00:48:31.104 --> 00:48:33.710
wait until next year and consume
the terminal value.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:37.422
I would take my income this
year, invest it at the interest

00:48:37.422 --> 00:48:41.262
rate, and it would turn into
Y today times (1 + R) and

00:48:41.262 --> 00:48:44.949
then I get income next year;
so I could consume all that.

00:48:44.949 --> 00:48:47.909
I can consume at any point
along that line as well.

00:48:47.909 --> 00:48:50.935
I could consume at today's
income, or I could consume here,

00:48:50.935 --> 00:48:54.292
or I consume down here.
If I consume less than my

00:48:54.292 --> 00:48:57.741
income today,
I'm saving and my consumption

00:48:57.741 --> 00:49:02.679
would be lower this year.
Am I doing that right?

00:49:02.679 --> 00:49:06.922
No, if I'm saving this year my
consumption would be less than

00:49:06.922 --> 00:49:11.023
my income, so my consumption
might be here and I would then

00:49:11.023 --> 00:49:15.458
have more next year.
Each individual reaches a

00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:22.032
decision--each individual has an
income point and decides how

00:49:22.032 --> 00:49:27.510
much to consume based on the
budget constraint.

00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:32.213
Now, the interest rate in
Irving Fisher's world has to

00:49:32.213 --> 00:49:36.650
equate supply and demand in the
market for debt.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:42.093
Each person who wants to borrow
has to be met by somebody else

00:49:42.093 --> 00:49:46.198
who wants to lend,
so the interest rate that we

00:49:46.198 --> 00:49:49.590
have in society is the
compromise.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:55.521
It's the interest rate that
clears the market for loans and

00:49:55.521 --> 00:50:01.349
that interest rate determines
the market interest rate.

00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:06.250
Nobody can see the interest
rate--why the interest rate's at

00:50:06.250 --> 00:50:10.570
the level it is in the
market--because nobody can see

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:16.110
all these individuals;
but that's why the interest

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:21.619
rate gets determined and is in
equilibrium.

00:50:21.619 --> 00:50:24.830
Why the interest rate
clears--it's a mysterious

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:28.458
phenomenon, because it's a
market phenomenon and each

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:32.715
person only sees his or her own
contribution to the market and

00:50:32.715 --> 00:50:36.763
not the whole market.
Irving Fisher also drew on the

00:50:36.763 --> 00:50:40.440
curve a production possibility
frontier for society,

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:45.836
which he made downward-curved.
This is production possibility

00:50:45.836 --> 00:50:51.166
frontier and that is a
curve--you've seen these before

00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:57.200
in economics--that says how the
production of our society can

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:03.033
produce different combinations
of income this year and next

00:51:03.033 --> 00:51:05.753
year.
If there were no credit

00:51:05.753 --> 00:51:09.900
markets, everyone would have to
be on the production possibility

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.260
frontier;
there would be no other choice.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:16.537
But if we have credit markets,
then people can individually

00:51:16.537 --> 00:51:20.961
choose to be off the production
possibility frontier and at a

00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:24.869
higher level of consumption than
otherwise would.

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:29.324
You might have some people up
here who are saving and other

00:51:29.324 --> 00:51:33.318
people down here who are
dissaving and the production

00:51:33.318 --> 00:51:36.159
would be operating at the
middle.

00:51:36.159 --> 00:51:42.370
So, that is Irving Fisher's
diagram in a nutshell,

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:50.610
but I think it's--so what does
it say about the term structure?

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:53.833
It says that at different
horizons everything on this

00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:56.948
diagram is different.
The production possibility

00:51:56.948 --> 00:52:00.519
frontier at different horizons
is in different places.

00:52:00.519 --> 00:52:04.687
The budget constraint is going
to have a different slope to it

00:52:04.687 --> 00:52:08.102
and preferences will be
different over this horizon

00:52:08.102 --> 00:52:11.449
between consumption then and
consumption now.

00:52:11.449 --> 00:52:15.502
So you--it doesn't--this theory
doesn't say a whole lot about

00:52:15.502 --> 00:52:19.419
what the term structure will
look like but it suggests that

00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:23.810
it's determined by the interplay
of lots of economic factors.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:39.371
I want to talk about a couple
of other basic concepts in

00:52:39.371 --> 00:52:44.687
economics of interest rates.
One of them is the forward rate

00:52:44.687 --> 00:52:49.900
and the other one is inflation
indexed interest rates.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:57.677
Forward rates--I wrote a survey
article years ago about the term

00:52:57.677 --> 00:53:05.454
structure of interest rates and
I wanted to find out who was the

00:53:05.454 --> 00:53:10.639
originator of the term "forward
rate."

00:53:10.639 --> 00:53:14.617
I asked my graduate student
research assistant to research

00:53:14.617 --> 00:53:18.734
the whole literature and find
out where did the word forward

00:53:18.734 --> 00:53:22.318
rate come from.
My graduate student came back

00:53:22.318 --> 00:53:27.147
and said, it seems to have been
Sir John Hicks in London in his

00:53:27.147 --> 00:53:30.730
1931--1939 book,
A Value in Capital.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:42.815
This is another aside.
but I think it's motivational,

00:53:42.815 --> 00:53:45.342
and so I said,
are you sure that J.R.

00:53:45.342 --> 00:53:48.290
Hicks invented the term
"forward rate"?

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.018
He said, how can I be sure?
I mean, I've looked through

00:53:51.018 --> 00:53:52.699
everything;
I can't find any earlier

00:53:52.699 --> 00:53:54.375
reference.
And he said,

00:53:54.375 --> 00:53:56.739
I think it's J.R.
Hicks.

00:53:56.739 --> 00:54:00.186
Then, I was talking it over
with another graduate student

00:54:00.186 --> 00:54:04.064
and he said, well if you want to
find out why don't you ask J.R.

00:54:04.064 --> 00:54:06.326
Hicks?
And I said, wait a minute,

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:09.690
is that guy still alive?
He said, I think he is.

00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:13.880
I found out he was living in
London--Lord Hicks;

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:17.360
I guess he got knighted for his
contribution.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:20.403
I wrote him a letter and I
said, basically,

00:54:20.403 --> 00:54:24.795
did you invent forward rates?
Then, I didn't get any response

00:54:24.795 --> 00:54:28.395
for like three months and then
to my surprise I got a

00:54:28.395 --> 00:54:31.303
hand-written letter,
in kind of a trembling

00:54:31.303 --> 00:54:34.469
handwriting;
I still have it.

00:54:34.469 --> 00:54:36.769
I should--I can put it up on
the screen actually.

00:54:36.769 --> 00:54:44.980
He said, my apologies--he was
very polite and diplomatic.

00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:48.948
He said, my apologies for not
answering your letter but my

00:54:48.948 --> 00:54:52.219
health is poor and--but it was a
long letter.

00:54:52.219 --> 00:54:55.669
He said, I'm trying to remember
where I got the idea and,

00:54:55.669 --> 00:54:59.118
he said, I think it probably
came from some of our coffee

00:54:59.118 --> 00:55:02.630
hours at The London School of
Economics in the 1920s.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:05.909
He said, we were discussing
that, and then he said,

00:55:05.909 --> 00:55:09.845
I thought it was in a book that
my wife and I translated from

00:55:09.845 --> 00:55:13.387
the Swedish in the 1930s but,
he said, I've looked and it's

00:55:13.387 --> 00:55:15.487
not there.
So he said, I guess maybe it is

00:55:15.487 --> 00:55:17.929
my idea--I was the first person
to write it up.

00:55:17.929 --> 00:55:22.207
Then he died shortly
thereafter, so I got to him just

00:55:22.207 --> 00:55:25.512
in time.
I thought I would describe

00:55:25.512 --> 00:55:31.336
forward rates in terms of the
coffee hour at The London School

00:55:31.336 --> 00:55:35.243
of Economics in the '20s.
This is J.R.

00:55:35.243 --> 00:55:41.207
Hicks talking--so the year is
1925--and we're talking about

00:55:41.207 --> 00:55:47.889
investing in discount bonds and
we're going to put £100.

00:55:47.889 --> 00:55:54.940
Now suppose--the idea that
Hicks invented is that they're,

00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:02.609
implicit in the term structure,
there are future interest rates

00:56:02.609 --> 00:56:07.070
already quoted.
I showed you the term structure.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:11.056
I showed you a one-year
Treasury bill rate for right

00:56:11.056 --> 00:56:14.965
now--that's not right now,
but you can see I have a

00:56:14.965 --> 00:56:18.639
one-year and a two-year Treasury
bill rate.

00:56:18.639 --> 00:56:22.665
The idea of a forward rate is
that, implicit in that term

00:56:22.665 --> 00:56:26.260
structure is also a quote for
the one-year rate,

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.062
one year hence,
because if you look at the

00:56:29.062 --> 00:56:31.727
two-year rate,
can't you infer back what

00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:34.940
interest rates are going to be
in one year?

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:39.604
Because the two-year rate
is--you've got the one-year rate

00:56:39.604 --> 00:56:42.550
and the two rate,
so between the two,

00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:45.225
what's left?
The difference between those

00:56:45.225 --> 00:56:47.908
two somehow reflects what
interest rates will be between

00:56:47.908 --> 00:56:50.377
one and two.
What Hicks said--this is the

00:56:50.377 --> 00:56:54.163
coffee hour conversation at The
London School of Economics--he

00:56:54.163 --> 00:56:57.870
said,
it's right now 1925 but if you

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:03.650
want to invest or borrow in 1926
I can do it for you.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:07.590
I can lock in the interest rate
right now.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:15.827
So let's say,
okay I expect--suppose I expect

00:57:15.827 --> 00:57:22.035
to get £100 in 1926.
Here we are,

00:57:22.035 --> 00:57:24.447
sitting in 1925,
and I want to,

00:57:24.447 --> 00:57:27.906
today in 1925,
lock in the investment return

00:57:27.906 --> 00:57:32.329
that I will get when I invest
that hundred pounds.

00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:38.978
So, what we want to do--this is
what Hicks discovered--I can do

00:57:38.978 --> 00:57:43.159
the following transaction to
lock in,

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:49.650
in 1925, the interest rate
between 1926 and 1927.

00:57:49.650 --> 00:57:56.112
Here we are sitting in 1925;
I'm going to buy in '25 this

00:57:56.112 --> 00:58:03.165
amount of two-period bonds--two
year-bonds--(1 +

00:58:03.165 --> 00:58:11.870
r_2)²/(1 +
r_1).

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:27.655
These will mature and be worth
£100 in '26 and I'm going

00:58:27.655 --> 00:58:34.644
to short how much?
I'm going to short one

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:37.700
one-period bond.

00:58:45.719 --> 00:58:52.582
This is the number of bonds I
have to buy and so let's analyze

00:58:52.582 --> 00:58:56.435
this.
That's all I have to do and I

00:58:56.435 --> 00:59:00.030
have locked in the interest
rate.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:04.329
r_1 is the
yield on the one-period bond and

00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:08.630
r_2 is the
yield on the two-period bond.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:12.507
The price of the two-period
bond is 1/(1 +

00:59:12.507 --> 00:59:17.992
r_2)²
and the price of the one-period

00:59:17.992 --> 00:59:21.869
bond is 1/(1 +
r_1).

00:59:21.869 --> 00:59:26.789
If I buy this amount of
two-period bonds,

00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:31.716
how much does it cost me?
It costs me 1/(1 +

00:59:31.716 --> 00:59:37.666
r_1).
If I short the one-period bond

00:59:37.666 --> 00:59:43.640
it cancels out,
so I've made no net purchase in

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:47.134
1925.
I bought a number of two-period

00:59:47.134 --> 00:59:51.726
bonds such that the value of my
purchase exactly equals the

00:59:51.726 --> 00:59:56.239
proceeds that I get from
shorting the one period bond,

00:59:56.239 --> 00:59:59.559
so I've made a zero wealth
transaction.

00:59:59.559 --> 01:00:04.652
It hasn't affected my
portfolio--my cash position--at

01:00:04.652 --> 01:00:09.373
all.
What happens then in--that's in

01:00:09.373 --> 01:00:14.440
1925, so there's no cash flow at
all.

01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:23.756
In '26, what happens?
Well, in '26,

01:00:23.756 --> 01:00:28.919
the--I've shorted the
one-period bond and so I have to

01:00:28.919 --> 01:00:33.206
pay out one dollar,
but that's exactly what I

01:00:33.206 --> 01:00:37.386
wanted to do.
Remember, I said I'm doing this

01:00:37.386 --> 01:00:41.457
because I expect to have a
hundred pounds--I said one

01:00:41.457 --> 01:00:46.154
dollar--I'm going to have to pay
out a hundred pounds because

01:00:46.154 --> 01:00:49.720
this one-period bond,
worth one hundred pounds

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.909
principal, is coming due so I
have to pay it out.

01:00:52.909 --> 01:00:55.499
That's what I wanted to do
because I said I'd have a

01:00:55.499 --> 01:00:59.295
hundred pounds to invest.
Nothing happens to the

01:00:59.295 --> 01:01:05.139
two-period bond because it just
continues to mature.

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:13.540
So 1926, I pay one hundred
pounds.

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:22.354
What happens in 1927?
Now what happens is,

01:01:22.354 --> 01:01:26.730
I now get the maturity of this
bond.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:35.169
What I get--I have purchased
this number of bonds,

01:01:35.169 --> 01:01:46.019
so I'm going to get a hundred
pounds times that amount there,

01:01:46.019 --> 01:01:50.516
the number of bonds--(1 +
r_2)²/(1 +

01:01:50.516 --> 01:01:55.347
r_1).
You can see that by doing this

01:01:55.347 --> 01:02:01.320
transaction I have locked in a
return between 1926 and 1927.

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:05.469
I did it in 1925,
but I've got it set up so that

01:02:05.469 --> 01:02:11.119
I will pay a hundred pounds in
1926 and I'll get this in 1927.

01:02:11.119 --> 01:02:18.175
He calls the forward rate equal
to (1 +

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:28.760
r_2)²/(1 +
r_1).

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.648
This is Hicks's discovery.
You might say,

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:35.046
this should have been obvious
to someone, but it had never

01:02:35.046 --> 01:02:37.827
been written up well before.
What Hicks said is that in

01:02:37.827 --> 01:02:40.612
these term structures,
you don't just have today's

01:02:40.612 --> 01:02:43.340
interest rates--this is a
map–actually,

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.976
I've just showed the
one-period, he had one-period

01:02:45.976 --> 01:02:49.258
forward rate--but you could do
it over any combination and you

01:02:49.258 --> 01:02:52.539
can get forward rates of any
maturity at any future date.

01:02:52.539 --> 01:02:59.394
That's Hicks's insight and it
comes back then to Hicks's book,

01:02:59.394 --> 01:03:03.440
Value and Capital,
in 1939.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.865
He said that we shouldn't think
that the--the simplest story of

01:03:07.865 --> 01:03:10.650
the term structure of interest
rates,

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.745
which he expounded there,
is that forward rates equal

01:03:13.745 --> 01:03:17.319
expected future interest rates.
That means, in the

01:03:17.319 --> 01:03:22.327
simplest--it's called the
expectations theory of the term

01:03:22.327 --> 01:03:25.607
structure.
It says that the forward rate,

01:03:25.607 --> 01:03:29.206
which you can compute from
today's newspaper or from

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:33.723
today's website--you can compute
the forward rates for all future

01:03:33.723 --> 01:03:36.356
dates.
What he says is those forward

01:03:36.356 --> 01:03:39.942
rates are what people think
interest rates will be in the

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:43.719
future and that's called the
expectations theory of the term

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:46.115
structure.
Forward rates equal expected

01:03:46.115 --> 01:03:49.044
future spot rates.
If you look at the December

01:03:49.044 --> 01:03:52.824
2003, what's going on?
It's very clear and that is the

01:03:52.824 --> 01:03:56.917
Fed had just cut interest rates
to 1%--it was unusual--it was

01:03:56.917 --> 01:04:00.535
much talked about.
People didn't expect that to

01:04:00.535 --> 01:04:04.750
hold and so people thought,
well it's going to still be

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:07.559
down at 1% maybe in three
months.

01:04:07.559 --> 01:04:12.326
So, you can see the term
structure doesn't go up between

01:04:12.326 --> 01:04:16.288
overnight and three months.
But they are expecting that the

01:04:16.288 --> 01:04:18.859
Fed is eventually--and they were
right of course in this

01:04:18.859 --> 01:04:21.289
case--the Fed is eventually
going to raise rates.

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:25.257
The upward-sloping term
structure means that the forward

01:04:25.257 --> 01:04:30.350
rates are at higher levels.
So, that's the expectations

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:37.134
theory.
Hicks also talked about another

01:04:37.134 --> 01:04:45.690
theory in his 1939 book,
which is--there's the

01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:54.817
expectations theory,
but there's also a liquidity

01:04:54.817 --> 01:04:58.620
premium theory.

01:05:13.469 --> 01:05:20.620
This is the theory that there's
risk in longer-term bonds,

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:27.394
so there's a tendency for
upward-sloping term structure

01:05:27.394 --> 01:05:31.660
even if expectations are flat.

01:05:34.679 --> 01:05:41.318
So, according to the
expectations theory augmented

01:05:41.318 --> 01:05:49.312
with liquidity preference--This
strongly upward-sloping term

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:55.679
structure in 2003 would reflect
two things.

01:05:55.679 --> 01:05:59.831
One is that people expected
interest rates to go up and,

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:03.303
secondly, that interest
rates–longer-term

01:06:03.303 --> 01:06:07.687
bonds--are riskier,
so there's also another effect

01:06:07.687 --> 01:06:12.298
pushing interest rates up.
The last thing I want to talk

01:06:12.298 --> 01:06:16.602
about is just--I'm running out
of time here and I want to

01:06:16.602 --> 01:06:19.829
mention this before your
mid-term exam,

01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:25.014
which is next Monday and covers
everything through this

01:06:25.014 --> 01:06:30.389
lecture--something about
inflation and interest rates.

01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:41.836
Inflation--we'll call that
π--the inflation rate is

01:06:41.836 --> 01:06:44.452
π.
So right now,

01:06:44.452 --> 01:06:47.881
it's something like 2% or it's
a little bit higher last year,

01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:50.110
but maybe it'll be 2% going
forward.

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:57.952
The real interest rate,
computed from nominal rates,

01:06:57.952 --> 01:07:06.563
is equal to one plus the
nominal rate divided by one plus

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:11.940
the inflation rate,
so it corrects for inflation.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:16.475
If you have an interest
rate--this is approximately

01:07:16.475 --> 01:07:21.555
equal to--one plus the real
interest rate is equal to one

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:26.553
plus the nominal interest rate,
divided by one plus the rate of

01:07:26.553 --> 01:07:29.785
inflation.
So we would say the real

01:07:29.785 --> 01:07:36.572
interest rate equals the nominal
rate--approximately equals--the

01:07:36.572 --> 01:07:40.990
nominal rate minus the inflation
rate.

01:07:47.059 --> 01:07:50.297
If we have--right now,
if we go back to our current

01:07:50.297 --> 01:07:53.469
term structure–well,
this isn't complete.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:56.320
If you look at the current term
structure, it's interesting.

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.429
Look how--this is as of earlier
this year;

01:07:59.429 --> 01:08:03.335
the Federal Funds Rate was at
around 4% and it has this huge

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:06.512
drop in the term structure and
then it starts the

01:08:06.512 --> 01:08:08.750
upward-sloping.
Why is that?

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:11.971
That's because on the date that
I got this term structure

01:08:11.971 --> 01:08:15.134
everybody knew the Fed was
cutting rates and they got it

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.960
exactly right.
The Fed was cutting rates to 3%;

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.760
they knew it was coming but not
today.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:26.980
Right now, we have a Federal
Funds Rate of about 3% and an

01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:33.310
inflation rate of around 3%,
so right now the real interest

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:38.498
rate is close to 0.
Finally, I just want to say

01:08:38.498 --> 01:08:43.955
that we have also a kind of bond
called an indexed bond,

01:08:43.955 --> 01:08:49.710
which is a bond whose coupons
are indexed to inflation.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:54.614
With an indexed bond you don't
have to do this calculation to

01:08:54.614 --> 01:08:58.157
get the real rate.
The yield-to-maturity on an

01:08:58.157 --> 01:09:02.394
indexed bond is already in real
terms because the coupons are

01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:07.447
indexed to inflation.
In my final slide is a picture

01:09:07.447 --> 01:09:13.026
of the first indexed bond;
this is issued by the State of

01:09:13.026 --> 01:09:16.520
Massachusetts--I actually own
this bond.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.869
I bought it for $1,000 on a
website because I was interested

01:09:20.869 --> 01:09:24.122
in indexed bonds.
I could have brought it to

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:28.183
class and showed it to you,
but this was issued during the

01:09:28.183 --> 01:09:31.390
Revolutionary War to help
finance the war.

01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:34.425
Now, what happened was the U.S.
Government--or the

01:09:34.425 --> 01:09:38.150
Massachusetts Government--had
created high inflation during

01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:41.938
the war and nobody wanted to
lend money to it so they create

01:09:41.938 --> 01:09:45.284
here a price index.
It says the price index

01:09:45.284 --> 01:09:49.677
contained this amount of beef,
this amount of sheep wool,

01:09:49.677 --> 01:09:54.069
this amount of sole leather,
and this amount of corn;

01:09:54.069 --> 01:09:58.075
that was the first consumer
price index ever used for

01:09:58.075 --> 01:10:01.127
financial contracts.
We now have something else

01:10:01.127 --> 01:10:05.649
called the Consumer Price Index.
This bond was paid off,

01:10:05.649 --> 01:10:11.856
the U.S.–Massa
chusetts--didn't fail to pay on

01:10:11.856 --> 01:10:18.046
it in 1784.
But anyway, indexed bonds are

01:10:18.046 --> 01:10:22.571
about 15% of the U.S.
national--I'm sorry,

01:10:22.571 --> 01:10:25.928
about 8% of the U.S.
national debt--about 15% of the

01:10:25.928 --> 01:10:28.290
U.K.
national debt--and they are

01:10:28.290 --> 01:10:32.310
very important but still a
minority of all of our fixed

01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:36.357
incomes.
That concludes this lecture and

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:42.084
I won't be here on Monday,
but we'll have our lecture in

01:10:42.084 --> 01:10:43.817
this classroom on Monday.

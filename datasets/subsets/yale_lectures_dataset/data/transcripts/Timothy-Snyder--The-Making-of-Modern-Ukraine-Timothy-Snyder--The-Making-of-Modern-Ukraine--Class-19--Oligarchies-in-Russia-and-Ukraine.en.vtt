00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.016
(majestic music)

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.350
- Okay, greetings.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.570
We're getting towards
the end of this class,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
so I wanted to remind you
that there is a second exam.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.460
You know that.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.020
And I also want to remind you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.840
that there is a brief written assignment

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.250
for this class as well.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.080
It's not meant to be complicated.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.480
You don't really need to do
any additional research for it.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.670
It's essentially about
looking at the reading

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.030
that you've got and finding
some kind of a theme

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.880
that you think is interesting
in Ukrainian history.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.830
Ideally, not a theme which is identical

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.820
to one of the lectures.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.530
Ideally a theme where you've connected

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.200
some of the dots yourself.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.170
It doesn't have to be an
incredible brainstorm,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.877
just a theme,

00:00:50.877 --> 00:00:55.620
Just an idea that unites other ideas.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.330
And talk to your TFs about it,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.910
that's what they're there for.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.390
So this is not meant to be tricky.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.890
It's just meant to be for a way

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.210
to try to rethink the class diagonally,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.580
make some connections
that maybe I didn't make

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.870
or the reading didn't make.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.390
Try to connect different
parts of the reading

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.320
with one another

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.063
in a way which maybe I didn't do.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.150
Talk about it amongst
yourselves, not right now,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.760
but talk about it amongst yourselves.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.310
That's a good way to think
of ideas, is to brainstorm

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.230
what some of these things could be.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.550
Might even be fun,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.590
meet your classmates.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.140
Invite that person you
always wanna invite for tea.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.460
Here's your chance.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.293
(student chuckling)

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:35.553
Who knows what will happen?

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:38.553
(student chuckling)

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.090
speaking of who knows what will happen,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.390
it appears that a couple
of Russian missiles

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.523
just fell on Polish territory,

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:53.704
which leads us nicely
into our theme today.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.730
What I'd like to do today is
I actually wanna take a step

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.180
back and talk at greater length

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.980
about the Polish factor,

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.480
just as I did a couple of lectures ago

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.090
about the German factor.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.150
I wanna do properly what
I meant to do last time,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.740
which is to give you a
sense of how Polish policy

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.220
after 1989 helped Ukraine

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.800
to become the state
that Ukraine has become.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.110
I would use that to lead
into the main subject,

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.480
which is the 1980s, the 1990s,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.470
and the formation of a Ukrainian state.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.960
So from today's point of view,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.990
November 15th or so, 2022,

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.830
where Poland is Ukrainian
staunchest supporter,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.690
or one of Ukrainian staunchest supporters.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.870
Where there have been
millions of Ukrainian refugees

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.180
in Poland in the last nine months.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.960
It's very difficult to
remember that in fact,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.680
Ukrainian national
identity when it formed,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.903
was formed against Poland.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.306
Against Poland.

00:02:57.306 --> 00:03:01.530
And so the Cossack legend,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.660
the struggling peasantry,

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.730
the battle for land,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.450
all of that is chiefly about,
not Russia, but Poland.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.740
It's about Poland.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.190
And then the Polish Ukraine
encounter over the centuries

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.040
has also created a lot of the concepts,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.650
a lot of the underlying political notions

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.650
that are taken for
granted in Ukraine today

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.480
and has been creative
in lots of other ways.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.330
So I just wanna start by
reminding you of that.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.890
I know that you know it,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.530
'cause one of the basic themes
of this class has been that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.213
nations don't come from nowhere.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.457
Humans evolved once in Africa.

00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:40.770
None of us is truly autochthonous,

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.800
groups come into contact with one another.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.510
The alphabet was only invented once.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.610
I can do this all day,

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.890
So when we look at a nation,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.850
the gut instinct of a
state is very often to say

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.470
there was ethnogenesis

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.660
and a people formed a thousand years ago,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.540
and maybe there was a baptism
or like some magical event

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.800
where we all started,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.450
cherry tree was cut down, whatever,

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.040
constitution, you name it.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.567
Like some moment where everything is like,

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:08.460
you get a clean, fresh start.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.500
But that's not the way
history actually works.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.713
Nations are par excellence,

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.890
international events.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.340
And so in order to explain
Ukraine or any other country,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.920
you have to get all the
international factors

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.420
into the picture.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.830
This is something that Roman Szporluk

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.170
who was and is a great
Ukrainian historian,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.003
always insisted on.

00:04:29.003 --> 00:04:30.420
And it's true for everybody.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.370
It's true for Russia, it's true for China,

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.900
It's true for America.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.610
If it weren't for the
particular configuration

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.680
of British-French relations

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.570
having to do with the Seven Years War,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.660
no America or some completely
different version of America.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.670
All right, so I wanna just remind you

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.720
how important the Polish
factor has been for Ukraine.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.600
You know that it was Lithuania,

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.580
which very quickly thereafter

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.740
formed a personal union with Poland,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.010
which swept up most of the
territories of old Rus,

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.330
including Kyiv.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.860
You know that it was Lithuania,

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.130
which very quickly merged with
Poland in a personal union,

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.600
which perpetuated much of the
cultural attainments of Kyiv,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.420
including the language of law.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.520
And much of the law.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.940
You know that because of
the Polish-Lithuanian state

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.593
or the Lithuanian-Polish state,

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.430
Kyiv becomes a major
center of European trends

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.910
such as renaissance,
reformation, counter reformation.

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.890
Kyiv along with Chernihiv,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.540
a couple of other places,

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.310
if this were a class
in Belarusian history,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.060
we'd be talking about some
other characters like Skaryna.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.810
But Kyiv is one of the places
where an orthodox world,

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.890
an eastern Christian world,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.760
is bouncing up against
these Western trends.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.290
And that's because of
the Polish connection

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.420
or the Lithuanian connection.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.580
The idea of a republic,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.083
which is very important,

00:05:55.929 --> 00:05:59.596
Res publica, Rzeczpospolita, Rich Pospolyta

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.270
The idea of a republic comes from Poland.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.540
It's not coming directly
from Rome of course,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.490
it's coming from Poland.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.150
The idea of political rights in a republic

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.010
which may not be held by everybody.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.560
And of course the dispute
between the Cossacks

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.350
and the Polish nobility
back in the 16th century,

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.430
17th century is largely about
who belongs to the republic.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.980
Who actually has rights?

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.290
If the republic means the common matter,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.490
who is the public?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.980
Who has access to rights.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:34.830
Both at the micro level
and at the macro level,

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.100
the Cossacks rebellion of
1648 is largely about that.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.220
If Bohdan Khmelnyts'kyi had
had better access to justice

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.070
by way of courts, if he'd
been seen as a noble,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.810
then probably no rebellion,

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.643
at least not at that time.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.490
The Cossacks themselves,

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.640
this particular formation
of Cossacks anyway

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.720
around Zaporizhzhia is a
result of Polish power...

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.360
Encounter of Polish power
with the Crimean Tatars.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.220
They're living in the
zone between Polish power

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.415
and the Crimean Tatars

00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:06.423
and they're learning from
both, adapting to both.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.153
So Poland-Lithuania loses the Left-Bank.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.090
I've gotten all kinds
of directions from email

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:16.350
about what I should do with my hands

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.870
when I talk about
Left-Bank and Right-Bank.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.520
They say, when you talk
about the Right-Bank,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.360
move your left hand

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.280
and then the students will understand.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.113
But I'm just assuming

00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:24.960
you guys don't actually don't even know

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.520
your left from right.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.070
So it doesn't matter what I do.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.120
I'm assuming you're like my kids.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.380
They're like, if I say
left, they go right,

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.220
They go da, da, da, da.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.710
So I'm just gonna do
whatever I want with my hands

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.580
when I talk about...

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.650
But the eastern part of Ukraine,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.910
Poland loses, the Left-Bank
is lost in the 1660s, 1670s.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.610
The Right-Bank is lost
about a century later

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.093
when Poland is partitioned 1770s, 1790s.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.030
There are four or 500 years
here that one has to account for

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.280
where the Polish factor
is very, very direct.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.680
And even after Poland no longer exists,

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.700
as we've talked about,

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.920
it's still the Polish aristocracy
that owns much of the land

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.730
Right-Bank, Ukraine,

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:08.490
all the way up to the
Bolshevik Revolution.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.820
So there too, there's an important idea

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.890
of property rights

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.710
and the desire of Ukrainian peasants

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:18.930
to have to have property.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:21.690
Then there's also this minor current,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:23.070
which becomes major later on,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.870
which is Galicia Volhynia.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.060
Halychyna (indiscernible) Galicia.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.060
Which is part of Poland known
as Czerwona Ruś

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.230
Red Ruthenia.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.380
It's part of Poland from the 1340s onward,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.510
and then is part of the Habsburg monarchy,

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.430
and then is part of Poland again.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.430
And then that region Halychyna Galicia

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.140
becomes part of the Soviet Union

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.390
after the Second World War.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:53.163
And then is much of what we
now call Western Ukraine.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.860
So I'm just reminding you,

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.020
I don't want you to forget any of this

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.000
when we enter into the modern period.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.300
'Cause there's this temptation
in the 20th century,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.790
this kind of unhealthy temptation to say,

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.960
well something has just happened

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.430
and now everything else is gone.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:11.550
Like the First World War,
the 'war to end all wars,'

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.760
And the Second World War was
thought to reset everything.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.590
And then the Cold War came to an end

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.800
and history itself supposedly
then also came to an end.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.410
All these mental resets.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.040
But there's no way to understand Ukraine

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.540
without this long trajectory.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.450
Which of course can be
interpreted in various ways.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:32.010
But it's uncontroversial,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:33.930
and I think incontrovertible to say,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.970
without the Polish factor in the long run,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.775
there wouldn't be a Ukraine of the kind

00:09:37.775 --> 00:09:40.140
that we now have.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.780
So what I wanna explain now

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.340
is the thing that I was very
hasty about the last time,

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.860
which is how Polish foreign policy

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.990
and Polish thinking about Ukraine

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.600
had a decisive and I
would even venture to say

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.590
world historical effect
in the 80's and in 1990s.

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.490
And to do this,

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.400
I need to draw your
attention to a certain...

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.380
I'm gonna have to make a
certain anti-imperial point,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.213
which is this.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.320
When people talk about
the period '89 to '91,

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.180
now they talk about Moscow and Washington,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.340
which is already problematic,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.530
because what happened in '89 to '91

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.360
had a lot to do with
Warsaw, Prague, Budapest,

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.210
Vilnius, a lot of other places.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.280
But more than that,

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.470
people talk about Moscow and Washington

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.573
as though they knew what they were doing.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.690
Especially with respect to Washington.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.690
There's this very strange
view which holds that...

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.760
The Soviet Union broke up in
1991 because the Americans,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.850
and they were all powerful
and they machinated...

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.763
is that a word?

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:47.612
It was all (indiscernible)

00:10:47.612 --> 00:10:49.410
like they were behind everything

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.550
and somehow there was a plot

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.220
and they wanted to break
the Soviet Union up.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.873
And that's just not so.

00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.150
That's just not so.

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:58.530
American policy at the time

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.320
was to hold the Soviet Union together.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.150
And the period '89 to '91

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:06.300
was a series of one unexpected
event after the other,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:09.330
which people reacted to
sometimes very skillfully.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.000
The Bush Administration
reacted very skillfully

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.830
to an unexpected situation,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.660
especially with respect to
the unification of Germany.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.600
There were some good diplomats
at work, no denying that,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.610
but basically nobody expected

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.770
the East European revolutions of '89.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.710
And even after the East
European revolutions of '89,

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.800
very, very few people
expected the Soviet Union

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.810
to fall apart in 1991.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:32.610
And the American political class

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.130
was working with great determination

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:36.570
in the opposite direction

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:38.400
to try to keep Gorbachev in power

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.953
and to try to keep the
Soviet Union together.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.450
I mention all that because
this is not a class

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.470
about the Cold War,

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.950
although Arne Westad teaches
great classes about this.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.690
This is a class about Ukraine.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.780
But it's very important to
see that these countries,

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.580
which where people lose focus,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.370
what people remember about '89 to '91.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:06.270
I mean, what's one image from '89 to '91?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:07.110
- [Student 2] The fall of the Berlin Wall.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:08.970
- Yes, David Hasselhoff.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.400
Sorry that joke did not work.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.990
That joke was totally out...

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:14.640
You know who David Hasselhoff is?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:17.910
So you know that he
played on the Berlin Wall.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.460
Yeah, so David Hasselhoff
here is like KITT

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.870
and Knight Rider.

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.730
That was Knight Rider, yeah.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:25.380
Because in Germany he's a rock star.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.700
And in Austria he's a rock star.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.710
And so when the Berlin wall fell,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.050
David Hasselhoff went and played...

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:32.100
You don't need David Hasselhoff,

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:34.410
but the image is the Berlin Wall falling.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:36.090
Which A, it didn't fall.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.040
It's a very dramatic image,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.140
The people... And then it fell.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:41.310
It didn't actually fall.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.210
They opened the gates

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:43.043
and they opened the gates,

00:12:43.043 --> 00:12:45.720
because an Italian
journalist asked a question

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.510
and the East German official
gave an ambiguous answer

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:50.160
and people went to the gates

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.500
and the border guards opened them

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.490
and then they charged into...

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.010
But that's not how communism
really came to an end.

00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.540
The reason why we like Berlin Wall

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.460
is because it's very dramatic, right?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.380
And because it's Germany

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.900
and Germany's a big important country.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.390
But the real action at
the end of the Cold War

00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.310
was not actually in Germany.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:09.810
The real action at the
very end of the Cold War

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:11.850
was much more in Poland
than anywhere else.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.710
And when it comes to the
end of the Soviet Union,

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.800
we can't understand that
part without Ukraine.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.210
I'm sure you all get that.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.580
So the point that I wanna make now

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:25.580
is that there was an interior
development inside Poland,

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.810
or among Poles that was running
against the main current

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.260
of communism and also
against the main current

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:35.310
of nationalism.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.260
And if that sounds contradictory,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.180
keep in mind that one of the ways

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.460
that communism was trying to stay in power

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.080
by the 70s and 80s

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.170
was as a kind of boring, homogenizing

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.610
version of nationalism.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.080
A nationalism which looked
back to uncontroversial symbols

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.540
that wouldn't defend the people in Moscow.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.660
A communism that took
credit in the Polish case

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:00.360
for making the country
nationally homogeneous

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:03.300
I.e. without Germans, without Ukrainians,

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.820
and without Jews.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.590
A communism which seemed
like it could go on forever.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.020
And indeed that is what
the 70s and 80s felt like.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.480
So in order to... (foot bumping desk)

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.313
Sorry.

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:20.130
In order to understand
the mood shift of '89,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.600
one has to grasp that

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.390
it really did seem like
that version of communism

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.220
could go on forever.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.280
It really did seem like
that they were winning,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.050
as they put it, the correlation of forces

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:32.100
was in their favor.

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.960
That they were winning in the third world,

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.820
that they would keep
winning in the third world.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.730
That their economy was big

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:40.650
comparable to the American economy.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:42.810
The CIA thought that
the Soviet economy was,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.930
in 1975, was 57% of the
size of the US economy,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:47.400
which it almost certainly wasn't.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.440
The East German economy
was thought of as being...

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.600
I forget, but it's like the
fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth,

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.033
one of the biggest economies in the world,

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:56.400
or at least per capita.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.990
Those things were really not true,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.943
but that's really how it seemed.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.080
The version of communism

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.360
which was going on in Poland,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.810
offers a kind of exception.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:13.800
And that exception was Solidarity.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.210
And I have to mention Solidarity.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.270
I realize this is a class about
Ukraine, not about Poland,

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.930
but the Solidarity movement in Poland.

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.370
Which one of your TAs,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.420
whose name I won't mention

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.670
since I've learned I shouldn't
mention anybody's name,

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:29.580
'cause then they get
like millions of emails.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.340
But one of your TAs who
shall now remain nameless,

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.480
works on this subject.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.010
I'll be very happy to
talk to you about it.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.693
And you can guess which one.

00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:41.700
So Solidarity is very special,

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:46.700
because what Solidarity does
is that it opens a window

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.710
where discussions of difficult questions

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.400
having to do with communism
and nationalism are possible.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.969
Solidarity is possible,

00:15:54.969 --> 00:15:59.490
because the Polish workers above all,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.710
who gets left outta the
story of the revolution?

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.550
The workers.

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.440
There was only one working
class revolution ever,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.273
and it was in Poland.

00:16:05.273 --> 00:16:06.600
And who gets left out of the story?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.163
Poland and the workers.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.660
'89 it's all about the
clever guys in the suits.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.080
No, it's fundamentally about
a working class revolution,

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.220
which began in Poland,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.510
which made it seem possible

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.160
that communism could come to an end.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.340
So what was special about Poland was this,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.720
in the 70s,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.930
the Polish regime was operating basically

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:29.790
the way that other communist regimes

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.260
in Eastern Europe were operating

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.660
and the way Brezhnev
wanted them to operate.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.870
Namely, no discussions of ideology,

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.760
marxism is dead,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.370
no serious attempts to reform the system.

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:42.840
Reform is dangerous,

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.220
if you try to reform,

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.520
we can invade you as in
Czechoslovakia in 1968.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.050
That's the Brezhnev doctrine.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.090
The country seems to be getting
a little bit out of line

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:52.563
than fraternal assistance.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.350
So the Polish government,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.240
which was led by a man
called Edward Gierek

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:03.060
took this to its logical extreme and said,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:07.680
this is all about
consumerism and nationalism.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.880
Then what we're gonna do

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:09.780
is we're gonna borrow...

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.960
And you can see how this is
just the next logical step.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.050
We're gonna borrow a lot
of money from the West,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.690
we're gonna let people
travel a little bit more,

00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.790
we're gonna work on refrigerators and cars

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:23.673
and consumer goods, try to provide them.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.390
And for about five years,

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.610
this seemed like it was going very well.

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.310
We're talking about the 1970s now.

00:17:34.362 --> 00:17:38.700
After about five years of
this you get oil crisis,

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.070
you get Poland not being able to pay back

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.750
its hard currency debts.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.920
So hard currency debt

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.600
may sound like a technical term.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.720
And up until the moment when
you don't have hard currency.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.810
So if you borrow money in
dollars or German marks

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:52.980
as they were at the time,

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.840
you have to be able to
pay it back in dollars

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:55.673
or German marks,

00:17:55.673 --> 00:17:58.260
which means that you have
to be able to sell something

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.150
which will give you
dollars or German marks,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.460
which the Poles were
not really in a position

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.596
to be able to do.

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:06.270
They over-invested in heavy industry.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.250
They didn't invest in things
that they could actually sell

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.170
like textiles and agriculture.

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.390
So they found the economy by 1979

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.390
went into the red GDP in
1979 in Poland, was negative.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.480
Solidarity begins as an economic protest

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.730
against price increases.

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:28.110
But it morphs very quickly
into a political movement

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:32.280
which demands the right to form a free

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:34.260
and independent labor union.

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:35.490
That's what Solidarity is,

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.130
it's a labor union.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.020
But also other political rights

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.060
like the release of political prisoners

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:44.130
and freedom of speech.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:48.330
Solidarity exists in
Poland for about 16 months

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:52.020
from August of 1980

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.690
until Marshal Law's
declared in December of 1981.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.940
And during the 16 month period,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.910
there is a free discussion in the press,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:03.810
in public among people of
many difficult questions,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.273
including the Ukrainian question.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.370
And Solidarity itself

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:09.990
does some very interesting things

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.520
with respect to Ukraine.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.560
Like for example, express its solidarity

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.630
with the nations of the Soviet Union.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.270
I'm sure that sounds incredibly...

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.520
Like an incredibly bland formulation now.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.640
But in 1981, that was an
extraordinary thing to say,

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.210
to recognize the nations
of the Soviet Union.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.950
And I'll talk more about this in a moment,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.050
but in Solidarity newspapers

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.090
and even in public discussions,

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.680
many of the difficult questions

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.110
of Polish-Ukrainian relations,
which we've talked about,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.743
like the ethnic cleansing in
Volhynia, Operation Vistula,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.140
The interwar Poland

00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.540
and its oppressive policies
towards Ukrainians.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.760
Many of these things were discussed,

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.530
Many of the things were worked out.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.230
People in Solidarity
had the sense correctly

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.460
that the Ukrainian question
was being used against them.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.370
That the Ukrainian question was being used

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.563
to keep Poles in their place.

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.130
How did they know to do this?

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.917
And this is the part that I
did in 45 seconds last time.

00:20:07.917 --> 00:20:10.440
And I wanna spend a
few more moments on it.

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.200
This is the part about where
I was trying to make the point

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.060
that history doesn't come to an end.

00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.100
And so you should plan for the future,

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.360
Which is, I'm sure that's
what your mom and dad

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.810
tell you all the time anyway.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:22.920
Sorry, I'm not gonna do an in imitation

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:23.753
of all of your parents,

00:20:23.753 --> 00:20:24.960
I have limited time.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.610
I only know some of your parents.

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.070
This is being filmed.

00:20:33.558 --> 00:20:34.391
The point though

00:20:34.391 --> 00:20:35.490
and it's a very serious point,

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.490
is that if you think
history is coming to an end

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:40.920
or if there's only one
destination for history,

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.310
then political imagination
just disappears.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.690
Just disappears.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:47.670
And if you're in a complaining mood,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:48.503
you might say,

00:20:48.503 --> 00:20:49.950
oh, this is the story of my lifetime.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:51.180
Because in the United States,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.160
everyone said history
came to an end in 1989

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.410
and then everyone stopped
thinking about the future

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:56.243
and here we are.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.790
That may give you an intuitive sense

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.090
of what I'm talking about.

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:05.460
But what happened in the Polish case

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.810
is that a group of...

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.380
A very small group of Polish thinkers

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.580
centered around this
journal called Kultura,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.360
rethought the issue of Poland
and its Eastern neighbors.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.100
And in particular they rethought

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.140
the issue of Poland and Ukraine.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.930
And the men and women who did this

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.010
were coming out of a liberal status milieu

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.240
in Interwar Poland.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.590
They didn't come from nowhere.

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.260
These were the same people
who in Interwar Poland,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.203
thought there should be
autonomy for Galicia.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.470
We have to take the Ukrainian
questions seriously.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.540
Some of them were active

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:47.250
in the attempt to create
autonomy in Volhynia.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.020
Some of them were thinking about

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:51.750
how we might break the Soviet Union apart.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.990
This group survives... Most of them,

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.493
survives a second World War.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.960
They end up abroad

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:03.660
in a suburb of Paris
called Maisons-Laffitte

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.393
which is chiefly known
for its horse races.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.660
In case you go there,

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.740
that's something you could do.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.853
The food's also nice.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.817
So they went to Maisons-Laffitte

00:22:13.817 --> 00:22:16.140
'cause they couldn't
afford the rent in Paris.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.340
And how did they get to Paris?

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.750
Here's how they got to Paris.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:21.750
First you serve in the Polish army.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:24.120
Second Germany invades,

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.340
third, you retreat to the East,

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.440
fourth Soviet Union invades,

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.840
fifth, you get deported to the Gulag,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.390
sixth after you deport to the Gulag,

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:35.370
Germany invades the Soviet Union.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:37.170
Seventh, Stalin decides

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.690
that he needs you to fight
after all on his side.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:41.820
Eighth, you're allowed to form an army,

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.280
but not one that's gonna
fight on the eastern front,

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.870
only on the western front.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:46.870
What number am I on?

00:22:47.814 --> 00:22:48.647
- [Students In Unison] Nine.

00:22:48.647 --> 00:22:52.200
- Ninth you form up...

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.000
You're released from the Gulag.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.500
You probably leave your
wives and children behind.

00:22:57.810 --> 00:22:59.360
You're released from the Gulag.

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.533
Men.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.259
You probably leave your wives
and children behind the Gulag,

00:23:08.259 --> 00:23:09.092
You form up...

00:23:09.092 --> 00:23:11.070
That part of the story
always gets left out.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.720
But if you think about
it for just a minute,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.320
you realize, well wait a minute,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.410
where were the women and children?

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:18.060
Oh, they were still in the Gulag.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.760
So you form up...

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.310
That's what heroism looks like.

00:23:24.046 --> 00:23:25.980
You form up in an army,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.690
in a base in southern Russia.

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:32.690
You make your way through
Iran, Iraq, Palestine,

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:37.410
Northern Africa, you fight on
the western front in Italy,

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:38.700
take terrible casualties,

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.980
especially at the famous
battle called Monte Cassino.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.170
That's the standard trajectory.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.690
And then after having done all of that,

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.940
of course the Soviets win
the war on the Eastern Front,

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.340
Poland goes communist, you can't go home.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.260
So simple little story.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.495
That's the basic trajectory

00:23:53.495 --> 00:23:56.190
of a lot of these folks.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.530
They're variations, but
that's the basic idea.

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.060
So these are people who are
very often Russian speakers

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.040
Jerzy Giedroyc's the
most important of them,

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:06.360
born in Minsk.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:10.530
Russian, probably his
preferred language of reading.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:12.483
Had a Russian wife for a while.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:16.830
Jozef Czapski, probably the
second most important of them.

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:18.363
Born in what's now Belarus.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.960
Very extremely cosmopolitan origins,

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.550
chooses Polish identity.

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.900
These are people who knew Russian,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.180
who knew Eastern Europe,

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.499
who had a sense that Poland...

00:24:29.499 --> 00:24:32.100
Their sensibility about Poland
was everything opposite.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.810
Everything contrary to the notion

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.190
that it was some kind of small

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.910
Central European ethnically
homogeneous entity.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.380
But their achievement,

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:43.330
their achievement was to
think about the future

00:24:44.614 --> 00:24:49.614
and to imagine what it would be like to be

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:51.840
an independent Poland in Eastern Europe.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.300
In other words, they went beyond

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:56.970
the obvious grievance position.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.410
I mean, it is totally obvious.

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:00.000
Poland lost half its territory,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.980
It lost millions of people during the war.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.900
It was an ally...

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.330
The whole second World War
was fought because of Poland.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.070
And even though it was an ally,

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.830
it still ends up under Soviet rule.

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.040
The entirety of Warsaw is
destroyed at the end of the war.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.860
So there are things to
have grievances about,

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:21.450
but they, if you want,
quite calmly or even coldly,

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.770
moved beyond the grievance.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.603
Oh, and the point is,

00:25:23.603 --> 00:25:24.436
a lot of these grievances

00:25:24.436 --> 00:25:25.860
could be directed against Ukrainians.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.630
Ukrainians got Western Ukraine.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.650
That's not what they called it.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:33.030
Ukrainians got the districts
of Małopolska wschodnia

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:33.870
they got Wołyń,

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:35.370
the Ukrainians got this territory from us.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.240
So a lot of these grievances

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.310
could be directed against Ukrainians.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.750
What Kultura did was

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.880
they moved beyond the grievance position

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.640
into what they portrayed
as a geopolitical position,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.660
which is interesting.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.720
They said, okay, if there's
gonna be an independent Poland,

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:50.220
how is that gonna be possible?

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.380
How is it gonna be possible?

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:55.890
It's gonna be possible with
an independent Lithuania,

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:59.313
independent Belarus and
especially independent Ukraine.

00:26:02.387 --> 00:26:04.680
And the reason why this is so important,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.203
this is their argument,

00:26:06.203 --> 00:26:08.310
is imperialism,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.840
imperialism.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.350
Russian imperialism will only be blocked

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:14.650
by an independent Ukraine.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.050
Polish imperialism

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:21.720
will only be blocked by
an independent Ukraine.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.240
There's a very important
degree of self-understanding

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.980
and self-knowledge in this.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.351
When I went to visit
Jerzy Giedroyc in Paris

00:26:29.351 --> 00:26:32.100
in Maisons Laffitte in 1994,

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.050
for the first time.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.510
He had no idea who I was.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.880
He didn't have a perfectly
high opinion of Americans

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.430
and I was just some kid.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.520
But I told him what I was working on.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.270
At the time I was working on Polish...

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:47.370
Contemporary Polish diplomatic relations

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:49.350
with Ukraine and Lithuania.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.183
And he said,

00:26:50.183 --> 00:26:52.619
he gave me this little
speech in which he said,

00:26:52.619 --> 00:26:53.550
Proszę Pana

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:56.400
You've probably heard a great deal

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.980
about the romantic
Polish legacy in the East

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.680
and all of the terrible suffering
of the Poles in the East.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.063
And he said,

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.180
This is all nonsense.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:09.183
Which is a very strong thing,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:14.010
to deny the entire frontier
rhetoric of your own country.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.230
Very strong position.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.123
To take Polish romanticism and say,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.820
just gonna push that aside.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.980
Very strong position,

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.393
very strong position.

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.630
And so they start with
the geopolitical logic

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.530
and the whole time,

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:29.643
what they say is,

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:31.980
this is all...

00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:35.010
Okay, this is all just cold
hard geopolitical reasoning.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.690
That's what they say.

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:40.080
But in order to carry this out,

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.390
in order to make Ukraine real,

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.400
they engage with Ukraine.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.510
And again, for a lot of them,

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.430
they've been already
doing this for decades.

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.480
So Giedroyc took a class
in Ukrainian history

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.940
in I think 1924 in Warsaw.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:56.280
Okay, so classes in Ukrainian
history, they're important.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.720
He took a class in Ukrainian history

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.550
as a law student in Warsaw.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.220
He was engaged with a Galician
question in interwar Poland.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.710
It wasn't the first time
they thought about Ukraine,

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.080
but they engaged with Ukraine

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.270
in the sense that they publish,

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.103
I mentioned this last time,

00:28:10.103 --> 00:28:11.940
they published Ukrainian writers,

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.440
They published George Shevelov,

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.350
who is a brilliant Ukrainian philologist.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.913
They published Borys Levyts'kyi,

00:28:19.172 --> 00:28:20.430
he was a otherwise unknown,

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.620
but very talented sovietologists

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.960
or contemporary historian
in the Soviet Union.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.090
They publish a thousand pages

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.610
of what Giedroyc calls
the 'Executed Renaissance,'

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.190
which is the murdered

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.020
or some of them committed suicide.

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.350
But the murdered or exiled
Soviet Ukrainian writers

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.400
of the 20s,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.787
the 20s and early 30s.

00:28:41.231 --> 00:28:43.530
In 1952, they publish a letter.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.363
I mentioned this last time.

00:28:44.363 --> 00:28:46.062
They publish a letter saying,

00:28:46.062 --> 00:28:51.062
let the blue yellow flag
fly over Lwów

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.460
which is an extraordinary... At the time,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.960
an extraordinary thing to say.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.670
And then they back that up

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:58.680
over the course of the 60s and 70s

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:01.260
with a long series of
geopolitical articles.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.120
But the entire time they're doing this,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.670
they're also publishing.

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:08.460
And here comes the slightly...

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:10.410
The part which is slightly impalpable,

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.650
but they also befriend Ukrainian writers.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:15.690
They befriend Ukrainian writers.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:18.270
Ukrainian writers become
part of their milieu

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:20.070
over the course of the decades,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.500
these friendships build up

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.750
and Ukraine becomes real for them.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.970
So the entire time they're
saying this is just like a

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.900
cold-hearted, you know,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.790
we're just cold-hearted geo politicians,

00:29:29.790 --> 00:29:31.980
we're just doing this in the
interest of the Polish state.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:35.130
And that's some of the truth,
maybe even most of the truth.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:36.810
But that calculation,

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:39.060
I mean, you might even
say that geopolitics

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:42.330
was only possible with the
help of the personal dimension.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.980
They couldn't have done it themselves.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.350
They needed to do it with the Ukrainians,

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.110
And so a lot of Ukrainians
found their voice.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.613
Oh and I almost forgot to say,

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.900
the person, he only published
one article in Kultura

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.733
to my knowledge.

00:29:55.733 --> 00:29:59.040
But the person who was
often guiding Giedroyc

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:02.010
about who to publish
on the pages of Kultura

00:30:02.010 --> 00:30:03.990
was this fellow Ivan Rudnyts'kyi

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.300
who I mentioned towards the
beginning of the course.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.300
Ivan Rudnyts'kyi who comes
from this Ukrainian family,

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.310
Jewish origin.

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.320
His mother was Milena Rudnyts'ka,

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.260
powerful orator,
parliamentarian interwar Poland.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:24.260
It was Ivan Rudnyts'kyi who in
the 60s and 70s in particularly

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.910
was winning the debate in the diaspora

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.970
about what kind of nation Ukraine was.

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.460
He was also advising Giedroyc

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.410
about who to publish in Ukraine.

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:35.880
Rudnyts'kyi, you know who Rudnyts'kyi is,

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:37.830
because you're doing the reading, right?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.120
I don't have to tell you who...

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.140
You're doing the reading.

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:41.790
Yes, I like the smiles when I say that.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.220
I'm not gonna think too hard
about what those smiles mean,

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.350
but I like them.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.650
So, Rudnyts'kyi who's the
most influential voice

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:50.880
on behalf of the argument

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.130
that Ukraine is a political nation

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.210
and not an ethnic one,

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:55.077
is involved with Giedroyc,

00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:57.210
who has a very similar idea.

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:58.980
A very similar idea about nationhood,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.700
which is its fundamentally
a political commitment,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.223
fundamentally about political action.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.280
So why am I dwelling on this so much?

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.140
I'm doing this so much because

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.820
you've seen in this class

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.960
how Ukraine is a result of,

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:19.623
and sometimes the victim
of various imperial powers.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.370
You can't make sense of
Ukraine without the Ottomans,

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.690
the Crimean Tatars.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.760
You can't make sense of Ukraine
even without the Swedes,

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:28.530
if only briefly.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:32.310
The Austrians certainly
matter quite a lot.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:34.890
And the Germans matter, definitely,

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:36.570
especially in the 20th century.

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.610
The most important imperial powers

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.490
would be the Russians and the Poles.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.960
If you look at the situation

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.230
as the Soviet Union is coming
to an end in the late 1980s,

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:48.720
you're down to only two
possible imperial power...

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:49.553
Well,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.790
let's be nice to everybody else.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.040
Only two possible imperial powers.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.170
The Poles and the Russians.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:01.230
And the Poles take themselves
out of the picture.

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.540
The Poles take themselves
out of the picture.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.660
The Poles in fall of 1990,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.360
before Ukraine is an independent state,

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.560
before the Soviet Union
has ceased to exist,

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:15.570
they make up this thing of a treaty

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.333
with a country that doesn't exist.

00:32:17.333 --> 00:32:19.803
Diplomacy can be more
interesting than you think.

00:32:22.987 --> 00:32:24.390
They make up this instrument,

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:25.620
which is a kind of treaty

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.270
with Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic,

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.008
which says we each recognize
each other's borders.

00:32:31.008 --> 00:32:32.220
It could seem trivial, right?

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.080
But it's not at all trivial.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.350
What they're doing is they're
putting the border question

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.693
off the table preemptively.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.900
And when they do this,

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.490
I should mention Solidarity again,

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:45.810
they're following the debate,

00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.173
which has been happening
in Solidarity in the 1980s.

00:32:50.082 --> 00:32:52.530
So the Solidarity debate
all moved in that direction.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.680
So when comintern came
to an end in Poland,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.210
it wasn't like in other countries

00:32:57.210 --> 00:32:59.700
where suddenly all the
historical questions

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.850
rushed out at once and
were very hard to handle.

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.700
That was true for the
Soviet Union by the way.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.960
In Poland it was a bit different.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.460
The historical questions, many of them

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.060
had already been set up

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:12.960
like the Ukrainian question.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.310
And so then when there was suddenly

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.990
a sovereign independent Poland,

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.930
they could make policy based
upon a previous discussion

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.773
which had already happened.

00:33:20.773 --> 00:33:23.760
So by the time that Ukraine
does become independent

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.200
in December of '91,

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.090
there is no Polish question,

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.130
there is no Polish question.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.690
The Poles have already declared

00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.700
that they are in favor of
an independent Ukraine,

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:34.950
which means that from December, 1991,

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.570
to the present day,

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.300
the only potential imperial power

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.950
and of course now real imperial power.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.350
But the only potential
imperial power is Russia.

00:33:45.926 --> 00:33:47.010
So you see where I'm going with this.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.958
The part of the making of modern Ukraine

00:33:49.958 --> 00:33:51.690
is the encounter with Poland.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.270
Part of the making of the
Ukrainian state as we know it now,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.100
has to do with Polish-Ukrainian relations,

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.950
which since 1991 have certainly
had their ups and downs.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.250
But the recognition of Ukraine
as an independent state

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:03.960
and Ukrainians as a separate people

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.523
has always been a constant.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.870
So in Ukraine itself,

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.160
I wanna mention three
influences on political thought

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.330
in the 70s.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:16.620
So as you've noticed,

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.250
I think the 70s are very
important for where we are now,

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:23.580
because the 70s were when
a certain generation,

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.110
which is still in power in Russia,

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.820
and Belarus was formed.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.190
And what's crucial in Ukraine, I think,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.910
is that that generation is no
longer in charge in Ukraine.

00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:34.290
The people who run Ukraine now

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:37.320
are in their upper 30s and and lower 40s.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.150
They're from a different generation.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.950
This generation, which in the Soviet Union

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:42.150
was called stagnation

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.880
or in Czechoslovakia normalization,

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.380
this generation of the 70s,

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:47.670
this generation where...

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.373
This time when ideas were
thought not to matter.

00:34:51.317 --> 00:34:53.550
When history, as I talked about last time

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.020
was thought to be over

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.780
when ideologies were all
thought to be discredited

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.600
and where cynicism was the dominant mood

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.257
that people had to try hard
to come up with some way

00:35:06.257 --> 00:35:08.850
to think outta the box.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.190
So at a time when East
Europeans are being invited

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.190
to just say all that really
matters is your personal...

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:18.060
We know, we agree with you.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.580
There's gonna be no
glorious communist future.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:22.440
We agree, we know, we admit it.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.030
This is really existing socialism

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.170
and this is good as it gets.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.790
But look,

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.910
cars, maybe some foreign travel,

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:32.520
refrigerators, television,

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.170
television was very important to this.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:36.030
Television programs.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.960
We'll give you that

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.220
and it's just gonna go on forever.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.540
There aren't any alternatives,

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.530
that's the deal.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:42.480
How do you think your way out of that?

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.073
And so this idea of normality.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.560
In Poland,

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.460
this is important,

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.770
to be abnormal in the
70s and 80s politically,

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:54.210
was to be Jewish or Ukrainian.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:55.920
Not really to be Jewish or Ukrainian.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.270
I mean some of them were Jewish.

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.380
But it meant...

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.200
So normal was like, you're with the crowd.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.210
You belong to the majority nation.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.760
You're not causing
trouble, you're with us.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:08.280
And the dissidents were all categorized

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.990
Jewish, Ukrainian, Jewish, Jewish, Jewish,

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:11.880
Ukrainian, Jewish,
Jewish, Jewish, Ukrainian.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:13.800
'Cause that's what the
secret police really liked.

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.260
They like to have them on the outside.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.880
So you're supposed to be normal.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.170
You're not supposed to raise your head,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:20.310
you're not supposed to raise your hand,

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.480
you're not supposed to raise your eyes,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.800
you're not supposed to have ideas.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.030
You're just supposed to go along

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.490
with this kind of consensus

00:36:26.490 --> 00:36:27.360
that we're day after day

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.100
we're gonna have the same thing.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.380
Human rights was an answer to that.

00:36:31.380 --> 00:36:32.880
Directly an answer to that.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:33.810
Directly, directly.

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.610
Because Brezhnev in 1975

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:43.020
wanted recognition of the status-quo.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.690
So Brezhnev in 1975,

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.810
along with the Americans,
the Canadians, the Europeans

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.760
held a conference in Helsinki.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.110
Very important conference,

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.000
things are still named after it today.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.850
People still find it very motivating.

00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.410
What Brezhnev wanted

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:00.720
was more the same forever.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.310
So what he wanted was

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:05.730
for the Western powers to
acknowledge the Soviet borders

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.220
and the borders of the
East European states.

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:10.890
So those borders were never
recognized by anybody.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.200
There was never a peace treaty
after the second World War

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.033
in Europe.

00:37:14.033 --> 00:37:15.600
So what he wanted was effectively

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.690
a late peace treaty

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.680
that would legalize,
codify the status quo.

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.290
The ironic outcome of all of this

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.460
is something else.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.260
He gets that, he gets that.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.750
But in exchange, there are a few...

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.160
If you read it, it's an
interesting document.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.020
If you read the Helsinki Final Act,

00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:35.760
there are a few paragraphs in there

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.810
kind of buried,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.640
about human rights.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.100
And what the East Europeans did

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.900
was they said, oh, we're gonna take this

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.330
extremely seriously.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:46.260
The East Europeans said,

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.850
well that's now the law of the land.

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:48.840
And of course they knew that

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.160
they weren't in rule of law states

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.020
and they knew that their
leaders didn't really mean it.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.850
But nevertheless the idea of human rights

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:55.140
became very fruitful.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:56.970
Because with human rights,

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:59.250
you can always find a gap

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:01.170
between what the state says it's doing

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:02.910
and what it should be doing.

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.890
With human rights you
always have an argument

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.930
coming from the person outwards

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:08.670
or from human dignity outwards

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:10.500
about the way things should be.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.260
It gives you a different kind
of language of evaluation.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.820
So all across Eastern Europe,

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.590
the Russians did this.

00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.170
the Russian dissidents had
already been publishing

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:20.003
since the late 60s,

00:38:20.003 --> 00:38:21.780
something called the
Chronicle of Current Events,

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.730
which was using human rights language.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.140
The Czechs did this,

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.710
Charter 77 launches the
distinct career Vaclav Havel

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.300
who eventually becomes president.

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.890
The Poles did this, they had a committee,

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.230
something called the Committee
to Defend the Workers.

00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:35.420
Ukrainians did this.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.610
In 1976, they formed something called

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.833
the Ukrainian Helsinki Committee.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.410
And Ukrainian Helsinki Committee.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.930
I'm sorry, I have to be
so hasty about all this.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:46.950
We're doing a thousand years

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.390
and these are fascinating figures,

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.350
but Ukrainian Helsinki Committee

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:53.340
makes the interesting argument

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.780
that the nationality is
part of human rights.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.050
So it's not that the
nation is an ethnic group,

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:05.100
but the fact that I
wanna speak my language

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.270
or that I wanna be able to sing my songs

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.740
or I wanna be able to wear my shirt.

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:14.100
These things are part of
my life as an individual.

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.060
And so that national rights
are actually individual rights,

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.110
human rights.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:20.070
They said lots of other things

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:23.250
that were much more
universalistic and conventional.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.750
But this is a point that they made.

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.190
It's a very telling point

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.800
that the nation doesn't
have to be a collectivity,

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:31.020
the nation could be something
which resides in people.

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:32.790
And you can violate their rights

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:34.840
by not letting them speak their language.

00:39:37.014 --> 00:39:39.270
So taking my school books away,

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.940
which is what happened in
the 70s in Soviet Ukraine.

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.460
The de facto not letting
me go to university

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.633
in my own language.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:48.990
Not hiring me,

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.280
because I'm known to be somebody

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.780
who speaks Ukraine in public.

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:53.550
That these are violations of human rights.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:58.053
And so the Brezhnevian language
is all technical efficiency.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.360
History's over,

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.770
it's all about how,

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:03.000
it's all about efficiency.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.070
So why don't we all just speak Russian.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.050
'Cause that would just be easier.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.760
How do you answer that language?

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.200
You can only answer that language

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:11.610
with some kind of why,

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.560
with some kind of normative position.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:16.020
And human rights gave
people that language.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.330
So one source of the political thinking,

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.130
which is gonna inform Ukraine later on

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.690
are the dissidents.

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:22.800
And the dissidents...

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:23.800
This is predictable.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:27.000
The dissidents end up in the Gulag.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.700
The Gulag is much smaller
by the 70s and 80s,

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:30.533
but it still exists.

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:32.550
There are two major camps

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.470
that Ukrainian dissidents are sent to.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:36.270
And in these camps,

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:38.880
they encounter Ukrainian nationalists,

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:43.140
because those people were
sentenced to 25 year terms.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.760
Sometimes repeatedly.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.800
And so Ukrainian nationalists

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.320
who were sentenced in the 40s, 50s,

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:52.680
were fairly regularly still in the Gulag

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.880
in the 70s and 80s

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.550
and there were conversations in the Gulag

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.510
about what kind of future
Ukrainian nation there would be.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:02.280
And again, I wish I could go
into more detail with this

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.450
'cause it's fascinating.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.130
But the basic drift is that

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.081
the political nation argument wins out.

00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:11.850
That the ethnic national
argument is seen for what it is.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.590
And certainly the dissidents in general

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.460
have respect for the nationalists
for having taken risks,

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.420
which they certainly did

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.850
and having resisted Soviet
power which they certainly did.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.310
But the argue, the general drift is

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:26.640
towards the political
characterization of the nation.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:29.430
The third place that this is happening

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:31.830
is in the diaspora

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:35.020
in Canada, in the United States especially

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:37.220
where it's the same...

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.310
Interestingly it's the same two sides.

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:43.440
Where many of the people,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.640
and this remains true,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:46.110
many of the people who are very active

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.670
in the Canadian-American diaspora

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.090
come from West Ukrainian
families who are associated with

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:53.190
nationalist politics.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.110
But over the decades,

00:41:55.110 --> 00:41:58.650
the argument becomes more
about the Ukrainian state

00:41:58.650 --> 00:41:59.910
and about how this thing,

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:02.010
which is Ukrainian-Soviet
socialist republic

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.990
and its present boundaries

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:06.780
will become an independent state

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:10.140
and what the politics
of that will be like.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.750
And although this is not easy for people,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:13.980
the reality of Soviet Ukraine

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:15.510
is that many people speak Russian.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.223
It's a multinational country,

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.610
making an independent
state with just the idea

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:22.710
of ethnic Ukrainians is
gonna be pretty tricky.

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:26.070
And so the argument that
Ukraine is basically political,

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.480
and this is not trivial.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.760
Also interesting...

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.274
You don't have to tell me
that you love the reading.

00:42:32.274 --> 00:42:33.420
You don't have to tell
me you love the reading.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.670
But at the time at least,

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.910
the adventures that Ivan
Rudnyts'kyi was making

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.860
in intellectual political history,

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.960
they were interesting.

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:44.400
I know I sound so defensive

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.570
for assigning you this stuff.

00:42:45.570 --> 00:42:48.120
But it wasn't just...

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.130
You'll notice he's not just writing about

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.480
how there were Ukrainian people

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:54.000
and look at their songs
and it lasted forever.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.650
That was my parody of Hrushevsky.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.860
It's about interesting combinations

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.410
and individuals and surprising currents

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:02.310
that meet each other.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.660
And it's also about contact
between Ukrainians and others.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.430
It's international history.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:12.270
So political nation means
interesting history.

00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:14.280
It means you're working
for an interesting account

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.420
of where you came from

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:16.290
and maybe where you're going.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.630
And so again, I'm abbreviating

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.920
these decades of debates.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.480
But again, it's the political notion

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.970
of what Ukraine is gonna
be like that wins out.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.400
And wins out before '91.

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.350
Wins out before '91,

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.510
which is very, very important,

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:34.890
because the Ukrainian territory
which is inherited in '91,

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:38.733
is indeed a complicated
and messy business.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:43.238
I have to be very brief
about this, unfortunately.

00:43:43.238 --> 00:43:46.800
So how did Ukraine become
an independent state?

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:48.960
Ukraine becomes an independent state,

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.070
because Gorbachev messes up his attempt

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.300
to reform the Soviet Union.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.740
Understandably.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.900
Gorbachev has the idea

00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.650
that communism can be reformed.

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:03.600
As he tries to reform communism,

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.870
he realizes he has to
consolidate his own position,

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:08.310
because the Communist Party

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:11.070
is full of defacto reactionary lobbies

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.440
that will drag their feet
and defend their interests.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.720
So he tries to build up a Soviet state.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.460
This is from '85 to '91.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.770
He tries to build up a Soviet state

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:22.500
where he's going to shift
being basically the president.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:23.580
He's gonna be the head of state

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:24.870
and that's gonna matter.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.340
As he does this,

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.950
the question is raised
about the federal structure

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:29.970
of the Soviet Union.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.640
So as you know, going back back to 1922,

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.070
essentially the Ukrainian question

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.080
means that the Soviet Union has to be

00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:39.420
or has to look like a federal state

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.280
with these national units.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.570
By summer of 1991

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:47.370
as a new state treaty is being discussed,

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.890
this question of how
centralized or decentralized

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:51.210
the Soviet Union is going to be

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.420
is the thing which pushes
Soviet Conservatives

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.330
against Gorbachev and brings about a coup

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:02.330
where people try to bring down
his rule in August of 1991.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:04.050
As a result of that,

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:05.760
Gorbachev is pushed into the background.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.230
So the hero then...

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:09.090
His name's not even on here, but you know.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.030
The hero then of that little episode

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:16.980
is a Russian communist
called Boris Yeltsin.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.480
And what Yeltsin does

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.090
is he sees this occasion,

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:23.370
he leads the resistance to the coup.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.753
Gorbachev is in his dacha.

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:27.630
That's where you are during a coup.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:29.130
If you were read your lines,

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.770
it's coup, okay go to dacha, read book,

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:32.970
wait for the knock on the door,

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.460
stay in dacha, that's how it goes.

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:37.800
So Gorbachev is in his dacha,

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.540
Yeltsin gets on top of a tank,

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.860
famously at that age,

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.934
he could still get on top of tanks.

00:45:42.934 --> 00:45:45.570
And the Russian military...

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.890
The Soviet military hesitates

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:48.600
and the coup plotters lose.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.150
Yeltsin takes advantage of this

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.610
to pull Russia out of the Soviet Union,

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.050
which leaves Yeltsin in charge.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:56.880
That's the way the Soviet
Union comes to an end.

00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.920
Russia pulls itself out.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.050
The second most important
actor in all of this

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:01.883
is Ukraine.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:07.410
The Russian, Belarusian
and Ukrainian leaders

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.500
of the Russian, Ukrainian
Belarusian parties

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:13.890
meet in a forest in Belarus.

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:15.840
They meet because they're the heads

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.440
of the three republics of 1922,

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.480
which still exist in 1991.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:24.720
So the constituent republics
of the Soviet Union

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.740
that still exist

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:29.190
meet to dissolve the Soviet Union.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.510
Now the Ukraine...

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.850
So the man who does
that is Leonid Kravchuk

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:39.420
and Kravchuk is a party Apparatchik.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.220
He had been responsible for ideology

00:46:42.450 --> 00:46:43.830
born in interwar Poland

00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.830
actually in the 30s, 1934 thereabouts

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:50.913
in Volhynia which was then in Poland.

00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:56.790
Kravchuk represents the
most important current

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.340
in the beginning of independent Ukraine,

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.523
which are the slightly
national communists.

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:06.450
Because you see by...

00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:09.930
Ukraine from 1972...

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.660
Soviet Ukraine from 1972 to 1989

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.290
had been ruled by the first
Secretary Volodymyr Shcherbyts'kyi

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:19.923
who was a conservative and a russifier.

00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:24.630
Ukraine had been one of the
least reformed republics

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.343
during the Gorbachev period.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:28.050
Shcherbyts'kyi was against Perestroika,

00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:30.513
He was against Gorbachev's reforms.

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.960
When the Chernobyl nuclear reactor blew up

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.330
in 1986 in Ukraine,

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.700
this made it seem like Gorbachev's
reforms were meaningless.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.200
One of his reforms are called Glasnost

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.030
which means transparency.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:44.490
But the reactor blew up and nevertheless,

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.110
they went out for the mayday parades

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.570
and irradiated themselves in Ukraine,

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.730
because Gorbachev didn't
want anyone to know

00:47:50.730 --> 00:47:53.160
that there had been
this terrible accident.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:54.270
So Gorbachev's reforms

00:47:54.270 --> 00:47:56.820
both in appearance and in reality

00:47:56.820 --> 00:48:00.210
were much slower in
Ukraine than elsewhere.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.740
So there was a very brief interval

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.330
before the Soviet Union came to an end

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.540
for Ukraine to get its politics in order.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:09.930
The result is that the way
that Ukraine comes to an end

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.980
is that the Communist Party

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:15.600
is still the main force

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.620
and there are people shifting

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.730
at the top of the Communist Party.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:19.170
This fellow Kravchuk gets in charge.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.930
He sees his opportunity after the coup.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.260
He has a referendum on
Ukrainian independence.

00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:26.250
I guess this is important today.

00:48:26.250 --> 00:48:28.140
There's a referendum on
Ukrainian independence,

00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:31.080
which a majority votes for
in every region of Ukraine,

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:32.490
including Crimea by the way.

00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:33.780
More than 90%...

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.680
This is 1991.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.413
More than 90% in the country as a whole.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:39.810
And they also have presidential elections.

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.409
And Kravchuk turns out to
be president, wonderful.

00:48:42.409 --> 00:48:44.310
So he works this out very well.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:45.690
But what he represents is

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.030
the most important current
in Ukrainian politics

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:49.230
at the beginning.

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:52.350
Which are the communists who
are able to ride this wave

00:48:52.350 --> 00:48:55.247
and reestablish themselves
in positions of authority

00:48:55.247 --> 00:48:57.153
inside Ukraine.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:01.050
So I didn't quite get to Paul Manafort.

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.460
You guys can remind me.

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:04.050
Make sure we get to Paul Manafort.

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.630
Paul Manafort will probably
appear in the next lecture,

00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.420
which Professor Shore is
giving about my Maidan.

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.770
She'll also be getting the bad news

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.950
that she has to do 15 years before Maidan.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:16.260
'Cause I only got as far as I got.

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:18.000
Please make sure to read that her book,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.380
I think it's the only
assigned reading this week.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.800
Please make sure to do the
reading before the lecture.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:23.800
Thank you very much.

00:49:24.688 --> 00:49:27.521
(papers rustling)

00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:31.875
(mystical music)

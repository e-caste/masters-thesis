00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.549
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So,

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:06.647
today we are going to do
something different from what's

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:09.181
happened so far,
in that we are going to study

00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:11.490
the dynamics of more than one
body.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.619
Well, you might say "Look,
we already did this last week,

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:18.200
when I studied the Solar
System,"

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.074
where there are planets moving
around the Sun so that makes at

00:00:21.074 --> 00:00:23.260
least two bodies,
the Sun and the planet.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.239
But actually,
the Sun was not doing anything

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.364
interesting in our analysis.
The Sun just stood there as a

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:30.470
source of the gravitational
force.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.204
It's the planet that did all
the orbiting and that was the

00:00:34.204 --> 00:00:37.480
problem in two dimensions,
but of only one body.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.331
So now, we are going to enlarge
our domain to more than one body

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:47.678
obeying Newton's laws.
So, let me start with the

00:00:47.678 --> 00:00:50.730
simplest possible case:
two bodies.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.198
And I will again start with the
simplest case of their moving in

00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:57.050
one dimension;
then, we'll put in more.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.878
So, here is the one-dimensional
world in which these bodies are

00:01:08.878 --> 00:01:12.146
going to move,
and this is my origin,

00:01:12.146 --> 00:01:15.887
x = 0,
and I'm going to imagine one

00:01:15.887 --> 00:01:19.583
point mass m_1,
located at

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:21.548
x_1,
another point mass

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.110
m_2,
located at

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.420
x_2.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.486
Now, we know everything there
is to know about these masses

00:01:35.486 --> 00:01:39.190
from the laws of Newton which
I'm going to write down.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.154
The first mass obeys this
equation, m_1

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:47.489
d^(2)x_1/ dt^(2).
That's ma, right?

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.220
But I'm going to write this in
a notation that's more succinct.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.879
I'm tired of writing the second
derivative in this fashion.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.957
I'm going to write it as
follows, m_1x

00:01:56.957 --> 00:01:59.420
_1,
with two dots on it;

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.033
the two dots telling you it's
two derivatives,

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.110
because one dot is one
derivative, three dots is three

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.530
derivatives.
Of course, at some point this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.305
notation becomes unwieldy,
but you never deal with more

00:02:10.305 --> 00:02:12.310
than two derivatives,
so this works.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.102
This is ma,
so don't forget the dots,

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.990
okay?
This is not some foreign

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.289
alphabet.
Every dot is a derivative.

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.650
You should remember that when I
do subsequent manipulation.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.231
That's ma,
and that's equal to force on

00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:28.010
body 1, F_1.

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.307
Now, look at the body one and
ask, "What are the forces acting

00:02:35.307 --> 00:02:37.387
on it?"
Well, it could be the whole

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:40.033
universe.
But we're going to divide that

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:43.267
into two parts.
The first part is going to be

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:47.815
the force on body 1 due to body
2, which I'm going to denote by

00:02:47.815 --> 00:02:50.699
F_12;
that's our notation.

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.190
You and I agree that it's the
force on 1 due to 2.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.030
Then, there's the force on 1
due to the external world;

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.778
e stands for external.
That means everything outside

00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:03.620
these two.
So, the universe has many

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.362
bodies;
I have just picked these two

00:03:05.362 --> 00:03:06.838
guys.
They're 1 and 2,

00:03:06.838 --> 00:03:10.106
and the force on 1 is--some of
it's due to 2,

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:13.300
and some of it's due to
everything else.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.760
Similarly, I have another
equation, m_2x

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.768
_2 double dot is
the force on 2 due to 1 plus the

00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:29.000
force on 2 due to the outside
world.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.280
What do you mean by "outside
world"?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.464
Maybe these two guys are next
to some planet,

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:34.500
and the planet's way over to
the right,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.121
it's pulling all of them
towards the planet with some

00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.906
gravitational force.
So, everything else is called

00:03:39.906 --> 00:03:42.377
"external."
And I have 1 and 2,

00:03:42.377 --> 00:03:46.120
for example,
are connected by a spring.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.849
The spring is not that
important.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.441
It's a way of transmitting
force from one body to the

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.622
other.
If you compress the spring and

00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:56.424
let it go, these two masses will
vibrate back and forth under the

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:58.860
influence of the other person's
force.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.412
That's an example of
F_12 and

00:04:00.412 --> 00:04:01.856
F_21.
For example,

00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:04.065
if the spring is compressed at
this instant,

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:06.797
it's trying to push them out;
that means, really,

00:04:06.797 --> 00:04:10.058
1 is trying to push 2 out,
whereas that way 2 is trying to

00:04:10.058 --> 00:04:11.889
push 1 to the left,
this way.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.120
That's an example of
F_12 and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.149
F_21.
The external force could be due

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.819
to something extraneous to these
two bodies.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:24.329
So, one example is at the
surface of the Earth.

00:04:24.329 --> 00:04:27.689
I take these two masses
connected by a spring.

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.350
Here is mass 1 and here's mass
2.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.337
I squash the spring.
If there is no gravity,

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:37.573
they will just go vibrating up
and down but let them fall into

00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:40.668
the field of gravity,
so they're also experiencing

00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:43.830
the mg due to gravity.
So, they will both fall down

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.449
and also oscillate a little with
each other.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.440
They're all described by this
equation.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.720
This will be the spring force
transmitted from 1 to 2.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.123
This will be the force of
gravity, or it could be an

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.810
electric force or any other
force due to anything else;

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.640
we are not interested.
Now, here is the interesting

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.610
manipulation we're going to
perform.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.025
We are going to add the two
things on the left-hand side and

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:08.209
equate them to whatever I get on
the right-hand side.

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:14.035
Then, m_1x
_1 double dot plus

00:05:14.035 --> 00:05:19.120
m_2x
_2 double dot,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.721
and that's going to be--I'm
going to write it in a

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.220
particular way,
F_1e +

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.410
F_2e + F_12
+ F_21.

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:36.490
I think you have some idea of
where I'm headed now.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.830
So, what's the next thing we
could say?

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.242
Yes?
Student:

00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:43.009
F_12 +
F_21 = 0.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.082
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:05:44.082 --> 00:05:45.209
because that's the Third Law of
Newton.

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:47.970
Whatever the underlying force,
gravity, spring,

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.703
anything, force on 1 due to 2,
and force on 2 due to 1 will

00:05:51.703 --> 00:05:55.264
cancel, and everything I get
today, the whole lecture is

00:05:55.264 --> 00:05:57.790
mainly about this one simple
result,

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.769
this cancellation.
Then, this whole thing,

00:06:01.769 --> 00:06:04.763
I'm going to write as
F_e,

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:09.040
meaning the total external
force on this two-body system.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.220
So, I have this peculiar
equation.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.666
I'm going to rewrite it in a
way that brings it to the form

00:06:18.666 --> 00:06:22.998
in which it's most useful.
I'm going to introduce a new

00:06:22.998 --> 00:06:26.007
guy, capital X.
As you know,

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:30.160
that's called a center of mass
coordinate, and it's defined as

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.313
m_1x_1 +
m_2x_2

00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:37.712
divided by capital M.
Capital M is just the

00:06:37.712 --> 00:06:39.770
total mass, m_1 +
m_2.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.750
If I do that,
this is a definition.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.860
Then, we can write this
equation as follows.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:56.560
I will write it and then we can
take our time seeing that it is

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.476
correct.
So, this is really the big

00:06:58.476 --> 00:06:58.860
equation.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.020
Why don't you guys try to fill
in the blanks in your head?

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.529
This is really correct.
On the left-hand side,

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.721
I have M times X
double dot, so I have really

00:07:14.721 --> 00:07:19.197
m_1 +
m_2 times X

00:07:19.197 --> 00:07:22.206
double dot.
If you take the double dot of

00:07:22.206 --> 00:07:25.686
this guy, it's m_1x
_1 double dot plus

00:07:25.686 --> 00:07:28.350
m_2x
_2 double dot,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.829
divided by m_1 +
m_2.

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:34.370
So, the left-hand side is
indeed this;

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.588
that's all I want you to check.
So, take this expression,

00:07:37.588 --> 00:07:40.639
divide by the total mass and
multiply by the total mass.

00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.723
Well, the multiplying by the
total mass is here,

00:07:42.723 --> 00:07:45.161
and when you divide by the
total mass you get the second

00:07:45.161 --> 00:07:47.290
derivative of the center of mass
coordinate.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:58.065
So what have I done?
I have introduced a fictitious

00:07:58.065 --> 00:08:02.266
entity, the center of mass.
The center of mass is a

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.921
location X,
some kind of a weighted average

00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:07.740
of x_1 and
x_2.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.420
By weighted,
I mean if m_1

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.899
and m_2 are
equal,

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:13.679
then capital M will be
two times that mass and you'll

00:08:13.679 --> 00:08:16.269
just get x_1 +
x_2 over 2.

00:08:16.269 --> 00:08:18.339
The center of mass will sit
right in between.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:20.404
But if m_1 is
heavier, it'll be tilted towards

00:08:20.404 --> 00:08:22.017
m_1;
if m_2 is

00:08:22.017 --> 00:08:23.810
heavier, it'll be tilted towards
m_2.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.959
It's a weighted sum that gives
a certain coordinate.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:30.490
There is nothing present at
that location.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.736
There's nobody there.
All the stuff is either here or

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:35.515
there.
The center of mass is the

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.470
location of a mathematical
entity.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.820
It's not a physical entity.
If you go there and say,

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.064
"What's at the center of mass?"
you typically won't find

00:08:42.064 --> 00:08:47.840
anything.
And it behaves like a body.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.644
After all, if you just said,
"I've learned Newton's laws,"

00:08:50.644 --> 00:08:52.759
and I walk into this room and I
say this,

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.836
you will say "Well,
this guy's talking about a body

00:08:54.836 --> 00:08:57.805
of mass, capital M,
undergoing some acceleration

00:08:57.805 --> 00:09:01.476
due to the force."
So, the center of mass is the

00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:06.033
body whose mass seems to be the
total mass of these two

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:08.603
particles,
whose acceleration is

00:09:08.603 --> 00:09:11.269
controlled by the same as
Newton's law,

00:09:11.269 --> 00:09:14.707
but the right-hand side
contains only the external

00:09:14.707 --> 00:09:17.000
forces;
this is the key.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.455
All the internal forces have
canceled out,

00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:23.909
and what remains is the
external force.

00:09:23.909 --> 00:09:26.504
Now it turns,
if you've got three bodies,

00:09:26.504 --> 00:09:28.840
you can do a similar
manipulation.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.381
And again, you'll have
F_12 and

00:09:30.381 --> 00:09:32.350
F_23 and
F_32 and so on.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.480
They will cancel and what will
remain will be a similar thing,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.759
but this is the total external
force.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:44.303
So, if I can say this in words,
what we have learned is that

00:09:44.303 --> 00:09:48.027
the advantage of introducing a
quantity called "center of mass"

00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:50.909
is that it responds only to the
total force;

00:09:50.909 --> 00:09:53.640
it doesn't care about internal
forces.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:59.710
So, I'll give an example.
Here is some airplane, right?

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.692
It's in flight,
and a couple of guys are having

00:10:02.692 --> 00:10:05.350
a fight, punching each other and
so on.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.107
The rest of the passengers say
"enough is enough" and they

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.341
throw them out.
So, they're just floating

00:10:10.341 --> 00:10:13.616
around, affecting each other's
dynamics, and of course this

00:10:13.616 --> 00:10:16.269
person will feel a force due to
that person,

00:10:16.269 --> 00:10:18.631
that person will feel a force
due to this person,

00:10:18.631 --> 00:10:21.682
but what I'm telling you is the
center of mass is going to drop

00:10:21.682 --> 00:10:24.386
like a rock.
It's going to accelerate with

00:10:24.386 --> 00:10:27.193
the force mgh;
it's going to accelerate with

00:10:27.193 --> 00:10:29.007
g.
So, at one point this person

00:10:29.007 --> 00:10:31.800
may be having the upper hand and
may be here, and the other

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.599
person may be down here,
but follow the center of mass

00:10:34.599 --> 00:10:37.029
and you'll find it simply falls
under gravity.

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:40.323
So, the mutual forces do not
affect the dynamics of the

00:10:40.323 --> 00:10:42.618
center of mass.
Or, for example,

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:46.785
suppose at some point,
this person blows the other one

00:10:46.785 --> 00:10:49.187
up into,
say, it's a samurai bat,

00:10:49.187 --> 00:10:51.815
make it simple,
cuts him up in two pieces,

00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:55.596
so now we've got three bodies
now: the first protagonist and

00:10:55.596 --> 00:10:58.976
the other two now,
unfortunately somewhat

00:10:58.976 --> 00:11:01.810
decimated.
Now, you can take these three

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.080
bodies, find their center of
mass;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.580
it'll be the same thing;
it'll just keep falling down.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.164
So, even though the system is
becoming more and more

00:11:10.164 --> 00:11:13.153
complicated, you cannot change
the dynamics of the center of

00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:15.131
mass.
It responds only to the

00:11:15.131 --> 00:11:17.633
external force.
If this fight was taking place

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:20.425
in outer space where there's no
gravity, then as this fight

00:11:20.425 --> 00:11:23.649
continues and people are flying
and parts are flying everywhere,

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.813
the center of mass will just be
in one location,

00:11:25.813 --> 00:11:27.899
not doing anything.
Yes?

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:30.211
Student: Couldn't the
internal forces change the

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:32.101
center of mass's location?
Professor Ramamurti

00:11:32.101 --> 00:11:33.389
Shankar: No,
that's what I'm saying.

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.412
The center of mass,
if it changes it can

00:11:35.412 --> 00:11:37.902
certainly-- No one says the
center of mass cannot

00:11:37.902 --> 00:11:40.073
accelerate.
It can accelerate due to

00:11:40.073 --> 00:11:42.933
external forces.
But if there were no external

00:11:42.933 --> 00:11:47.004
forces, then the center of mass
will behave like a particle with

00:11:47.004 --> 00:11:49.154
no force.
If it's not moving to begin

00:11:49.154 --> 00:11:51.797
with, it won't move later.
Or if it is moving to begin

00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:53.770
with, it'll maintain a constant
velocity.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:58.482
So, here's another example.
Now you can obviously

00:11:58.482 --> 00:12:00.539
generalize this to more than one
dimension.

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:04.298
If you're living in two
dimensions, you will introduce

00:12:04.298 --> 00:12:08.341
an x coordinate and
introduce a y coordinate

00:12:08.341 --> 00:12:12.099
and then you will have the
center of mass as MR

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:16.305
double dot equals F,
and R would be

00:12:16.305 --> 00:12:21.723
m_1r_1 +
m_2r_2

00:12:21.723 --> 00:12:26.019
divided by the total mass;
r_1 and

00:12:26.019 --> 00:12:29.744
r_2 are just
the location now in two

00:12:29.744 --> 00:12:32.689
dimensions of these two masses.
So, here is

00:12:32.689 --> 00:12:35.470
m_1 and here is
m_2 and the

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:38.250
center of mass you can check
will be somewhere in between the

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.060
line joining the two points,
but it'll now be a vector.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.519
So here's another example.
You take a complicated object;

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.070
it's got masses and it's got
springs;

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.279
it's connected with thread,
and chains and everything.

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.070
You throw the whole mess into
the air.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.759
All the different parts of it
are jiggling and doing

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:58.555
complicated movements,
but if you follow the center of

00:12:58.555 --> 00:13:00.141
mass,
in other words at every instant

00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:01.682
you take the
m_1r_1 +

00:13:01.682 --> 00:13:03.762
m_2r_2 +
m_3r_3

00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:06.091
and so on,
divided by the total mass,

00:13:06.091 --> 00:13:10.294
that coordinate will simply be
following the parabolic path of

00:13:10.294 --> 00:13:13.915
a body curving under gravity.
If at some point this

00:13:13.915 --> 00:13:16.880
complicated object fragments
into two chunks,

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.980
one will land here and one will
land there.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.711
But at every instant,
if you follow the center of

00:13:22.711 --> 00:13:26.240
mass, it'll go as if nothing
happened and it will land here.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:30.176
The center of mass does not
care about internal forces,

00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:33.610
only about external forces.
That's the main point.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.374
And it was designed in such a
way that external [correction:

00:13:36.374 --> 00:13:38.810
should have said "internal"]
forces canceled in these

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:41.425
dynamics.
So, everything I'm going to do

00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:45.235
today is to take that equation,
MX..= F or MR..=

00:13:45.235 --> 00:13:48.176
F, in vector form,
and deduce some of the

00:13:48.176 --> 00:13:50.556
consequences.
Now, first of all,

00:13:50.556 --> 00:13:53.953
you should realize that if
you've got several bodies,

00:13:53.953 --> 00:13:56.980
say three bodies,
then I will define the center

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:00.660
of mass to be m_ix
_i divided by the

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.504
sum of m_i.
This is a shorthand,

00:14:03.504 --> 00:14:06.315
I'm going to write it only
once, but you should know what

00:14:06.315 --> 00:14:09.428
the notation means.
If there is i from 1 to

00:14:09.428 --> 00:14:12.708
3, it really means
m_1x_1 +

00:14:12.708 --> 00:14:16.591
m_2x_2 +
m_3x_3

00:14:16.591 --> 00:14:19.536
divided by m_1 +
m_2 +

00:14:19.536 --> 00:14:22.985
m_3.
This summation is the notation

00:14:22.985 --> 00:14:26.653
mathematicians have introduced
where the index i will go

00:14:26.653 --> 00:14:29.688
over a range from 1 to 3.
Every term you let i

00:14:29.688 --> 00:14:32.140
take three different values and
you do the sum.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.923
An exercise I've given to you
guys to pursue at home is the

00:14:39.923 --> 00:14:41.990
following: if I got three
bodies,

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.488
1,2 and 3, you've defined the
center of mass,

00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:48.350
you can either go to this
formula,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.013
do all the m_1x
_1's and add them

00:14:51.013 --> 00:14:53.000
up, or you also have the
following option.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.346
You can pick any two of them,
say the first two -- forget the

00:14:56.346 --> 00:14:59.244
third one -- take these two,
find their center of mass,

00:14:59.244 --> 00:15:00.986
let's call it
x_1 and

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:03.058
x_2 and with
that total mass

00:15:03.058 --> 00:15:06.095
M_12,
which is just m_1

00:15:06.095 --> 00:15:08.744
+ m_2,
trade these two for a new

00:15:08.744 --> 00:15:11.040
fictitious object and put that
here,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.247
and forget these two.
But on that one point it

00:15:14.247 --> 00:15:18.154
deposits the mass of these two;
now, you take the center of

00:15:18.154 --> 00:15:20.833
mass of this object with the
third object,

00:15:20.833 --> 00:15:24.809
by the same weighting process,
m_3x_3 +

00:15:24.809 --> 00:15:27.568
M_12X&lt;
sub&gt;12 divided by the

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:32.375
total mass;
you'll get the same answer as

00:15:32.375 --> 00:15:34.231
here.
What I'm telling you is,

00:15:34.231 --> 00:15:36.765
if you've got many bodies and
you want the center of mass of

00:15:36.765 --> 00:15:39.517
all of them,
you can take a subset of them,

00:15:39.517 --> 00:15:42.750
replace them by their center of
mass, namely,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.947
all their mass sitting at their
center of mass,

00:15:44.947 --> 00:15:47.909
replace the other half by their
mass sitting at their center of

00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:50.286
mass,
and finally find the center of

00:15:50.286 --> 00:15:53.789
mass of these two centers of
mass, properly weighted,

00:15:53.789 --> 00:15:55.580
and that'll give you this
result.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.899
Okay, so, before I exploit that
equation and find all the

00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:06.924
consequences,
we have to get used to finding

00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:09.950
center of mass for a variety of
things,

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.325
as long as they give you ten
masses, or a countable number of

00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:15.800
masses, we've just got to plug
it in here;

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:20.092
it's a very trivial exercise.
Things become more interesting

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:24.434
if I give you not a set of
discrete masses but discrete

00:16:24.434 --> 00:16:27.449
locations,
namely, a countable set of

00:16:27.449 --> 00:16:30.480
masses, but I give you a rod
like this.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.824
This is a rod of mass M
and length L,

00:16:34.824 --> 00:16:38.559
and I say: "Where is the center
of mass?"

00:16:38.559 --> 00:16:41.181
So, we have to adapt the
definition that we have for this

00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:41.650
problem.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:48.529
So, what should I do?
Well, this is my origin of

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:50.809
coordinates.
If I had a set of masses with

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:54.259
definite locations I know how to
do it, but this is a continuum.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:58.999
The trick then is to say,
I take a distance x from

00:16:58.999 --> 00:17:02.553
the left hand,
and I cut myself a very thin

00:17:02.553 --> 00:17:05.600
sliver of taking this dx.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.939
That sliver has got a certain
mass, and I argue it's at a

00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:18.599
definite distance x from
the coordinate's origin.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.213
And if you're nitpicking you
will say, "What do you mean by

00:17:21.213 --> 00:17:23.566
definite distance?"
It's got a width dx,

00:17:23.566 --> 00:17:26.328
so one part of it is at
x, the other part is at

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:29.349
x + dx so it doesn't have
a definite coordinate.

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:33.385
But if dx is going to 0,
this argument will eventually

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.535
be invalid.
So dx goes to 0,

00:17:35.535 --> 00:17:38.695
sliver has a definite location,
which is just the x

00:17:38.695 --> 00:17:42.434
coordinate of where I put it.
So, to find the center of mass,

00:17:42.434 --> 00:17:46.172
which consists of multiplying
every mass by its location and

00:17:46.172 --> 00:17:49.910
adding--Let me first find how
much mass is sitting here.

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:54.200
Let me call it δm.
How much mass is sitting there?

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.057
Well, I do the following.
I take the total mass and

00:17:57.057 --> 00:18:01.160
divide it by L;
that's the mass per unit length.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:07.467
And this fellow has a width
dx, so the mass of this

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:11.339
little sliver is (M/L)
dx.

00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:17.425
Therefore, the center of mass
that I want is found by taking

00:18:17.425 --> 00:18:22.118
this sliver of that mass,
multiplying by its coordinate

00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:25.737
and summing over all the
slivers, which is what we do by

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:28.971
the integral from 0 to L.
Then, I should divide by the

00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:30.170
total mass, which is just
M.

00:18:34.529 --> 00:18:37.470
You can see now if you do this
calculation.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.276
I get 1/L;
then, I get integral xdx

00:18:41.276 --> 00:18:44.180
from 0 to L,
and that's going to be

00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:48.398
L^(2) over 2.
So, if you do that you'll get

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:51.203
L/2.
I'm not doing every step in the

00:18:51.203 --> 00:18:54.447
calculus because at this point
we should be able to do this

00:18:54.447 --> 00:18:58.330
without every detail.
So, the center of mass of this

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.819
rod, to nobody's surprise,
is right in the midpoint,

00:19:02.819 --> 00:19:06.862
but it assumes that the rod is
uniform, whereas [if its]

00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:09.735
like a baseball bat,
thicker at one end and thinner

00:19:09.735 --> 00:19:11.535
at the other end,
of course no one is saying

00:19:11.535 --> 00:19:13.311
that,
but we have assumed the mass

00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:15.576
per unit length,
namely M or is this a

00:19:15.576 --> 00:19:17.925
fixed number,
M/L, and then this is

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:21.527
the answer.
But there are other ways to get

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:25.900
this result without doing all
the work, okay?

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.604
So, we would like to learn that
other method because it'll save

00:19:29.604 --> 00:19:32.455
you a lot of time.
It must be clear to most people

00:19:32.455 --> 00:19:35.340
that the center of mass of this
rod is at the center.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.769
But how do we argue that?
How do you make it official?

00:19:38.769 --> 00:19:40.713
If you do the integral you will
get the answer,

00:19:40.713 --> 00:19:42.530
but I want to short circuit the
integral.

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:45.555
And here is a trick.
It's not going to work for

00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:48.029
arbitrary bodies.
If I give you some crazy object

00:19:48.029 --> 00:19:49.880
like this, you cannot do
anything.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.750
But this is a very symmetric
object;

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:54.329
you can sort of tell if I take
the midpoint.

00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:57.519
There is as much stuff to the
right as to the left and somehow

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:00.238
you want to make that argument
formal, and you do the

00:20:00.238 --> 00:20:02.759
following.
Suppose I have a bunch of

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:06.196
masses, and the object's really
not even regular,

00:20:06.196 --> 00:20:09.059
and this is my origin of
coordinates.

00:20:09.059 --> 00:20:13.083
If I replace every x by
-x, okay--sorry,

00:20:13.083 --> 00:20:17.790
I should change this object,
so this really looks like this.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.029
Here's the object.
Suppose I replace every

00:20:21.029 --> 00:20:25.620
x by -x that's
reflecting the body around this

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:30.256
axis, it will look like this;
it'll be jutting to the right

00:20:30.256 --> 00:20:33.560
instead of the left.
So, don't go by my diagrams.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:36.090
You know what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to draw the mirror

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.680
image of this object the other
way.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.899
Then, I think it's clear to
everybody, if I do that,

00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:43.964
X will go to -X,
because in this averaging

00:20:43.964 --> 00:20:45.385
m_ix
_i,

00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:47.870
sum of all the masses,
if every x goes to

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.809
-x the center of mass
will go to -X.

00:20:50.809 --> 00:20:55.218
But now, take this rod and
transport every particle to its

00:20:55.218 --> 00:20:58.529
negative coordinate.
And you take that guy and put

00:20:58.529 --> 00:21:02.192
it here, the rod looks the same.
If the rod looks the same,

00:21:02.192 --> 00:21:04.940
the center of mass must look
the same.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.011
That means -xX has to be
equal to x itself and the

00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:13.175
only answer is X = 0.
So, without doing any detailed

00:21:13.175 --> 00:21:17.329
calculation, you argue that the
answer is X = 0.

00:21:17.329 --> 00:21:19.921
To do this, of course,
you must cleverly pick your

00:21:19.921 --> 00:21:22.990
coordinates so that the symmetry
of the body is evident.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.652
If you took the body like this
and you took a reflection around

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:29.309
this point, it goes into body
flipped over.

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:31.230
There is not much you can say
about it.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.828
So, what you really want to do
is to pick a point of reflection

00:21:34.828 --> 00:21:37.730
so that upon reflection the body
looks the same;

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.549
the body looks the same,
the answer must be the same.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.442
But if you argue the answer
must be minus of itself,

00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:46.872
therefore the answer is 0.
This is how the center of mass

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.960
of symmetric bodies can be
found.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.769
So, we know the answer for this
rod.

00:21:51.769 --> 00:21:58.180
Suppose I give you not a thin
rod, but a rod of non-0 width.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.799
We want to know its center of
mass;

00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.839
we're not going to do any more
work now.

00:22:01.839 --> 00:22:05.397
By symmetry,
I can argue that this has to be

00:22:05.397 --> 00:22:09.451
the center of mass,
because I can take every point

00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:14.416
here and turn it into the point
there by changing y to

00:22:14.416 --> 00:22:17.231
-y;
therefore, capital Y

00:22:17.231 --> 00:22:20.378
will become minus capital
Y, but the body looks the

00:22:20.378 --> 00:22:22.890
same after this mapping.
So, capital Y is 0,

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.245
and similarly capital X
is 0, and that's the center of

00:22:25.245 --> 00:22:25.560
mass.

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:38.494
Okay, now, what if I give you
this object, anybody want to try

00:22:38.494 --> 00:22:39.440
that?

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.996
Would you guys like to try this?
Yes, can you tell me where the

00:22:49.996 --> 00:22:53.940
center of mass should be,
yeah?

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.640
No, no, the guy in front of
you, yes.

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.111
Student: The center of
mass, you can't get the center

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:05.794
of mass with two objects,
and then this is where you said

00:23:05.794 --> 00:23:13.519
over in the curve,
find the center between those

00:23:13.519 --> 00:23:16.492
two masses.
Professor Ramamurti

00:23:16.492 --> 00:23:17.990
Shankar: Okay,
is that what your answer was?

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:22.135
Okay, so the correct answer is,
replace this mass by all of its

00:23:22.135 --> 00:23:24.609
mass, whatever it is,
sitting here.

00:23:24.609 --> 00:23:26.930
Replace this one by all of its
mass sitting here;

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.740
then, forget the big bodies,
replace them by points.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.737
Then, he's got two masses
located here,

00:23:32.737 --> 00:23:34.840
and you can find the weighted
average.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.060
It may be somewhere there.

00:23:41.569 --> 00:23:45.779
Okay, now let's take one more
object.

00:23:45.779 --> 00:23:49.289
Then I'm pretty much done with
finding these centers of mass.

00:23:49.289 --> 00:23:54.089
The object I'm going to pick is
a triangle that looks like this;

00:23:54.089 --> 00:23:58.244
it's supposed to be symmetric,
even though I've drawn it this

00:23:58.244 --> 00:24:00.238
way.
That is b and that is

00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:02.550
b, and that distance is
h;

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:08.598
let the mass be M.
Where is the center of mass of

00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:11.352
this object?
Again, by symmetry,

00:24:11.352 --> 00:24:16.025
you can tell that the y
coordinate of the center of mass

00:24:16.025 --> 00:24:20.258
must lie on this line,
because if I take y to

00:24:20.258 --> 00:24:24.549
-y, it maps onto itself
so it looks the same.

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:26.619
But it's supposed to reverse
capital Y;

00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:29.180
therefore, Y is
-Y and therefore it's 0;

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:33.329
so, it's evidently lying
somewhere on this line.

00:24:33.329 --> 00:24:36.225
I cannot do further
calculations of this type by

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:39.737
saying where it is on the line,
because it has no longer a

00:24:39.737 --> 00:24:42.140
symmetry in the x
direction;

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.250
it's symmetric on the y
after flipping y,

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.670
but I cannot take x to
-x.

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.580
In fact, if I take x to
-x this one looks like

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.900
this, it doesn't map into
itself.

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.526
But I can pick any point here;
if I take x to

00:24:56.526 --> 00:24:58.339
-x, the object looks
different.

00:24:58.339 --> 00:25:01.638
It looks like that object and
relating one object to another

00:25:01.638 --> 00:25:05.105
object is what I'm trying to do.
I want to relate it to the same

00:25:05.105 --> 00:25:06.729
object.
That cannot be done for

00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:08.390
x.
It can be done for y;

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.890
for x you've got to do
some honest work.

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:16.008
The honest work we will do then
is to take this thing,

00:25:16.008 --> 00:25:20.258
take a strip here,
with location x and

00:25:20.258 --> 00:25:24.527
width dx,
and the height of that strip

00:25:24.527 --> 00:25:28.272
here is y;
y of course varies with

00:25:28.272 --> 00:25:30.889
x.
So, I'm going to argue that to

00:25:30.889 --> 00:25:34.629
find the center of mass of this
triangle I can divide it into

00:25:34.629 --> 00:25:37.869
vertical strips which are
parallel to each other,

00:25:37.869 --> 00:25:41.766
and find the center of mass by
adding the weighted average of

00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:44.755
all these things.
For that, I need to know what's

00:25:44.755 --> 00:25:50.390
the mass of the shaded region.
So, let's call it δm.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.500
The mass of the shaded region
is the mass per unit area.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.413
I'll find the area later on in
terms of b and h,

00:25:57.413 --> 00:26:01.316
but this is mass per unit area.
Then, I need to know the area

00:26:01.316 --> 00:26:04.107
of the strip.
I'm going to give the answer

00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:06.430
because I don't have time to
probe it.

00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:10.036
But you should think about what
the answer for the area of the

00:26:10.036 --> 00:26:13.160
shaded region is.
It's got a height 2y,

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.589
and it's got the width
dx.

00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:18.364
It's not quite a rectangle
because the edges are slightly

00:26:18.364 --> 00:26:21.189
tapered, but when δx
goes to 0, it's going to look

00:26:21.189 --> 00:26:26.369
like a rectangle.
So, the area is 2yδx.

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:29.890
But I don't want to write
everything in terms of y.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.740
I want to write it in terms of
x;

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:37.636
then, I do similar triangles.
Similar triangles tell me that

00:26:37.636 --> 00:26:43.405
y/b is x/h,
namely, that triangle compared

00:26:43.405 --> 00:26:49.069
to that triangle tells me
y/b is x/h.

00:26:49.069 --> 00:26:54.900
Therefore, the y here
can be replaced by bx/h.

00:27:02.349 --> 00:27:06.424
So, that is the mass of the
sliver here, and its center is

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:09.212
obviously here,
so that is a mass there,

00:27:09.212 --> 00:27:12.090
there's a mass there;
I've got to do the weighted

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.625
average of all of them.
So remember,

00:27:13.625 --> 00:27:15.650
I don't just integrate this
over x;

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.359
that would just give me the
mass of the body.

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:21.567
I should multiply it by a
further x and then do the

00:27:21.567 --> 00:27:24.483
integral.
So, what I really want to do to

00:27:24.483 --> 00:27:28.215
find the center of mass
x, is to take that mass I

00:27:28.215 --> 00:27:31.184
got,
M/A, there is a 2,

00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:35.176
there's an h,
there is a b,

00:27:35.176 --> 00:27:38.670
there is an x from
there,

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:41.554
and another x,
because you have to multiply

00:27:41.554 --> 00:27:44.380
this by the x coordinate
of this thing,

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.920
because that's the coordinate
of the center of mass of this.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.966
There are two xs,
that's what you've got to

00:27:49.966 --> 00:27:53.012
remember.
So, that should be integrated

00:27:53.012 --> 00:27:57.250
from 0 to h,
that'll give me h^(3)/3.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:04.450
So, I get (2Mb/Ah) times
h^(3) over 3.

00:28:09.269 --> 00:28:11.259
Now, you know there is one more
thing we have to do.

00:28:11.259 --> 00:28:15.669
We must replace the area of the
triangle by ½ base times

00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:19.705
altitude, which is bh.
I also forgot to divide

00:28:19.705 --> 00:28:23.312
everything by the mass,
because the center of mass is

00:28:23.312 --> 00:28:26.849
this weighted average divided by
the total mass,

00:28:26.849 --> 00:28:30.380
so I've got to divide by
1/M.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.771
Well, I claim,
if you do this and cancel

00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:35.960
everything you will get the
answer of 2/3h.

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:46.039
Okay, so not surprisingly the
center of mass of this is not

00:28:46.039 --> 00:28:49.306
halfway to the other end,
but two-thirds of the way

00:28:49.306 --> 00:28:52.769
because it's top heavy;
this side of it is heavier.

00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:57.467
This is the level of calculus
you should be able to do in this

00:28:57.467 --> 00:29:00.240
course, be able to take some
body,

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:03.799
slice it up in some fashion,
and find the location of the

00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:06.958
center of mass.
You combine symmetry arguments

00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:09.697
with actual calculation.
For this sliver,

00:29:09.697 --> 00:29:12.340
by symmetry,
you know the center of mass is

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:15.109
at the center,
you don't waste your time,

00:29:15.109 --> 00:29:18.087
but then when you add these
guys there is no further

00:29:18.087 --> 00:29:21.410
symmetry you can use;
you have to do the actual work.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:28.287
So, what have I done so far?
What I've done is point out to

00:29:28.287 --> 00:29:31.235
you that when you work with
extended bodies,

00:29:31.235 --> 00:29:34.519
or more than one body,
we can now treat the entire

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:37.482
body, replace the body by a
single point for certain

00:29:37.482 --> 00:29:39.993
purposes.
The single point is called a

00:29:39.993 --> 00:29:42.908
center of mass,
where it imagines all the mass

00:29:42.908 --> 00:29:45.369
concentrated at the center of
mass.

00:29:45.369 --> 00:29:48.380
So, you have created a brand
new entity which is fictitious.

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.240
It has a mass equal to total
mass.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.830
It has a location equal to the
center of mass,

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:57.500
and it moves in response to the
total force.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.250
And it's not aware of internal
forces, and that's what we want

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:05.953
to exploit.
I already gave you a clue as to

00:30:05.953 --> 00:30:13.004
what the implications are,
but let me now take a thorough

00:30:13.004 --> 00:30:19.299
analysis of this basic equation
MR..= F.

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:21.750
We're just going to analyze the
consequence.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:24.569
So there are several cases you
can consider.

00:30:24.569 --> 00:30:32.472
Case one:
F external not equal to

00:30:32.472 --> 00:30:33.160
0.

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:41.202
So, these are two bodies
subject to mutual force and to

00:30:41.202 --> 00:30:43.461
an outside force,
but the simplest example I've

00:30:43.461 --> 00:30:46.556
already given to you -- but I'll
repeat it -- we're not going to

00:30:46.556 --> 00:30:48.755
do this in great detail.
We all know,

00:30:48.755 --> 00:30:51.839
if I fire a point mass like
this, it will do that.

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:55.705
What I'm now telling you is,
if I take a complex body made

00:30:55.705 --> 00:30:58.622
of 20,000 parts,
all connected to each other

00:30:58.622 --> 00:31:01.807
pushing and pulling,
if you fling that crazy thing

00:31:01.807 --> 00:31:05.030
in the air it'll do all kinds of
gyrations and jiggling as it

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.885
moves around.
But if you found its center of

00:31:07.885 --> 00:31:11.477
mass, the center of mass will
follow simply a parabola,

00:31:11.477 --> 00:31:15.069
because the external force on
it is just Mg.

00:31:15.069 --> 00:31:18.826
So, it'll be MR..= mg
and that's just motion with

00:31:18.826 --> 00:31:22.036
constant acceleration in the
y direction,

00:31:22.036 --> 00:31:24.700
and it's just a projectile
problem.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.393
And I repeat once more,
for emphasis,

00:31:27.393 --> 00:31:30.759
that if this object broke into
two objects,

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:34.154
typically what'll happen is one
will fly there and one will land

00:31:34.154 --> 00:31:37.334
here, but at every instant if
you found their center of mass

00:31:37.334 --> 00:31:40.190
you will find it proceeds as if
nothing happened.

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.133
For example,
if you have an explosive device

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.619
that blows them apart,
and the pieces are all flying,

00:31:44.619 --> 00:31:48.438
but that's just coming from one
part of the piece pushing on

00:31:48.438 --> 00:31:51.630
another part of the piece,
but those forces are of no

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:53.952
interest to us.
As far as the external force

00:31:53.952 --> 00:31:57.106
goes, it is still gravity so the
center of mass will continue

00:31:57.106 --> 00:31:58.789
traveling.
Beyond that,

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:02.620
I'm not going to do too much
with this thing.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:10.150
So let me now go to Case II.
Case II.

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:15.190
If you want, case 2a.
F external is equal to 0.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:19.190
What does it mean if F
external is 0?

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:24.438
That means this is 0.
That means MR..

00:32:24.438 --> 00:32:37.431
= 0, that means MR.
is a constant because it's not

00:32:37.431 --> 00:32:42.920
changing.
Who is this MR.?

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:46.123
What does it stand for?
Well, it looks like the

00:32:46.123 --> 00:32:49.148
following.
If you take a single particle

00:32:49.148 --> 00:32:52.263
of mass m,
and velocity x.,

00:32:52.263 --> 00:32:55.931
we use the symbol p,
maybe I've never used it before

00:32:55.931 --> 00:32:57.950
in the course,
and that's called the momentum.

00:33:03.579 --> 00:33:06.909
The momentum of a body is this
peculiar combination of mass and

00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:10.425
velocity.
In fact, in terms of momentum

00:33:10.425 --> 00:33:14.626
we may write Newton's law.
Instead of saying it's

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:16.841
mdv/dt,
which is ma,

00:33:16.841 --> 00:33:20.063
you can also write it as
d by dt of

00:33:20.063 --> 00:33:23.196
mv,
because m is a constant

00:33:23.196 --> 00:33:27.237
and you can take it inside the
derivative, and that we can

00:33:27.237 --> 00:33:30.678
write as dp/dt.
Sometimes, instead of saying

00:33:30.678 --> 00:33:32.585
force is mass times
acceleration,

00:33:32.585 --> 00:33:36.279
people often say "force is the
rate of change of momentum."

00:33:36.279 --> 00:33:40.833
The rate at which the momentum
of a body is changing is the

00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:43.632
applied force.
So, if I've not introduced to

00:33:43.632 --> 00:33:46.079
you the notion of momentum,
well, here it is.

00:33:46.079 --> 00:33:49.419
So, if you think about it that
way, this looks like the

00:33:49.419 --> 00:33:52.916
momentum of the center of mass,
and we are told the momentum of

00:33:52.916 --> 00:33:55.640
the center of mass does not
change if there are no external

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.776
forces.
But the momentum of the center

00:33:57.776 --> 00:34:00.832
of mass has a very simple
interpretation in terms of the

00:34:00.832 --> 00:34:03.110
parts that make up the center of
mass;

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:06.640
let's see what it is.
Let's go back here.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.677
Remember, let me just take two
bodies and you will get the

00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:11.681
idea;
it's m_1 +

00:34:11.681 --> 00:34:14.659
m_2,
which is total M,

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:17.638
and let's take just one
dimension when it's

00:34:17.638 --> 00:34:22.035
m_1x_1.+
m_2x_2.

00:34:22.035 --> 00:34:25.510
over m_1 +
m_2;

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:30.908
that is what Mx. is.
So, m_1 +

00:34:30.908 --> 00:34:34.036
m_2 cancels here,
and you find this is just

00:34:34.036 --> 00:34:36.269
p_1 +
p_2.

00:34:36.269 --> 00:34:41.217
Let's use the symbol capital
P for momentum of the

00:34:41.217 --> 00:34:44.686
center of mass.
So, the momentum of the center

00:34:44.686 --> 00:34:48.159
of mass is the sum of the
momentum of the two parts,

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:51.573
but what you're learning is --
so let me write it one more time

00:34:51.573 --> 00:34:53.719
-- if F eternal is equal
to 0,

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:57.762
then p_1 +
p_2 does not

00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.330
change with time.

00:35:04.489 --> 00:35:07.516
This is a very,
very basic and fundamental

00:35:07.516 --> 00:35:11.796
property, and it's in fact
another result that survives all

00:35:11.796 --> 00:35:15.929
the revolutions of relativity
and quantum mechanics,

00:35:15.929 --> 00:35:19.440
where what I've said for two
bodies is true for ten bodies;

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.989
you just do the summation over
more terms.

00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:24.410
So, let me say in words what
I'm saying.

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.382
Take a collection of bodies.
At a given instant everything

00:35:28.382 --> 00:35:31.406
is moving;
it's got its own velocity and

00:35:31.406 --> 00:35:34.179
its momentum,
add up all the momenta.

00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:35.849
If you had one dimension,
just add the numbers.

00:35:35.849 --> 00:35:37.700
If in two dimensions,
add the vectors;

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.686
you get a total momentum.
That total momentum does not

00:35:40.686 --> 00:35:43.949
change if there are no outside
forces acting on it.

00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:49.199
So, a classic example is two
people are standing on ice.

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:53.645
Their total momentum is 0 to
begin with, and the ice is

00:35:53.645 --> 00:35:57.019
incapable of any force along the
plane.

00:35:57.019 --> 00:35:59.369
It's going to support you
vertically against gravity,

00:35:59.369 --> 00:36:02.170
but if it's frictionless it
cannot do anything in the plane.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:04.943
Then, the claim is that if you
and I are standing and we push

00:36:04.943 --> 00:36:06.699
against each other and we fly
apart,

00:36:06.699 --> 00:36:10.888
my momentum has to be exactly
the opposite of your momentum,

00:36:10.888 --> 00:36:13.869
because initially yours plus
mine was 0;

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:17.619
that cannot change because
there are no external forces.

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:19.837
If two particles are pushing
against each other,

00:36:19.837 --> 00:36:22.150
they can only do so without
changing the total.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.639
Okay, so p_1 +
p_2 does not

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:31.309
change, and here's another
context in which it's important.

00:36:31.309 --> 00:36:33.519
Suppose there is a mass
m_1,

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:35.929
going with some velocity
v_1,

00:36:35.929 --> 00:36:38.339
and here's the second mass
m_2,

00:36:38.339 --> 00:36:40.800
going with some velocity
v_2;

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.948
they collide.
When they collide,

00:36:42.948 --> 00:36:45.964
all kinds of things can happen.
I mean, m_1

00:36:45.964 --> 00:36:47.856
may bump its head on that and
come backwards,

00:36:47.856 --> 00:36:50.350
or it could be a heavy object
that pushes everything in the

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.039
forward direction,
or at the end of the day you

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:55.771
will have some
m_1 going with

00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:58.199
a new velocity
v_1',

00:36:58.199 --> 00:37:01.381
and m_2 going
with a new velocity

00:37:01.381 --> 00:37:04.489
v_2'.
But what I'm telling you is

00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:07.359
that m_1
v_1 + m_2

00:37:07.359 --> 00:37:10.228
v_2 will be equal
to m_1

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:13.500
v_1' + m_2
v_2‘.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.210
In a collision,
of course, one block exerts a

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:19.537
force on the other block,
and the other block exerts an

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:23.211
opposite force on this block,
and that's the reason why even

00:37:23.211 --> 00:37:26.329
though individually the momenta
could be very different,

00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:29.890
finally the momenta will add up
to the same total.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.611
Here's a simple example;
you can show that if this mass

00:37:34.611 --> 00:37:38.652
and that mass are equal,
and say this one is at rest,

00:37:38.652 --> 00:37:42.408
that one comes and hits this.
You can show under certain

00:37:42.408 --> 00:37:45.483
conditions this one will come to
rest and this will start moving

00:37:45.483 --> 00:37:48.313
with the speed of the--the
target will move at the speed of

00:37:48.313 --> 00:37:51.050
the projectile.
So, momenta of individual

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.512
objects have changed.
One was moving before,

00:37:53.512 --> 00:37:55.090
it is not moving;
one was at rest,

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:57.270
it's moving,
but when you add up the total,

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:59.855
it doesn't change.
This is called the Law of

00:37:59.855 --> 00:38:03.757
Conservation of Momentum.
So, that's so important I'm

00:38:03.757 --> 00:38:07.930
just going to write it down here
one more time.

00:38:11.579 --> 00:38:16.846
And the basic result is,
if external forces are 0,

00:38:16.846 --> 00:38:20.930
then p_1 +
p_2 +

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.924
p_3 and so on,
"before" will be

00:38:25.924 --> 00:38:29.324
p_1' +
p_2' +

00:38:29.324 --> 00:38:32.530
p_3',
and so on,

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:39.530
where this means "before" and
that means "after," .

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.789
When is "before" and when is
"after."

00:38:42.789 --> 00:38:45.460
Pick any two times in the life
of these particles,

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.750
it's like Law of Conservation
of Energy,

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:50.043
where we said E_1
= E_2,

00:38:50.043 --> 00:38:52.199
there 1 and 2 stood for
"before" and "after."

00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:55.141
Well, here we cannot use 1 and
2 for "before" and "after"

00:38:55.141 --> 00:38:57.610
because 1 and 2 and 3 are
labeling particles.

00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:00.763
So, the "before" quantities are
written without a prime,

00:39:00.763 --> 00:39:03.860
and the "after" quantities are
written with a prime.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:08.648
Everybody follow this?
It's very important you follow

00:39:08.648 --> 00:39:12.044
this statement and follow the
conditions under which it's

00:39:12.044 --> 00:39:14.619
valid.
There cannot be external forces.

00:39:14.619 --> 00:39:16.689
For example,
in the collision of these two

00:39:16.689 --> 00:39:19.415
masses, if there is friction
between the blocks and the

00:39:19.415 --> 00:39:21.347
table,
you can imagine they collide

00:39:21.347 --> 00:39:23.489
and they both come to rest after
a while.

00:39:23.489 --> 00:39:26.360
Originally, they had momentum
and finally they don't.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.334
What happened?
Well, here you have an

00:39:28.334 --> 00:39:30.897
explanation, namely,
the force of friction was an

00:39:30.897 --> 00:39:34.409
external force acting on them.
What I'm saying is that if the

00:39:34.409 --> 00:39:37.501
only force on each block is the
one due to each other,

00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:40.010
then the total momentum will
not change.

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:46.239
So, the case that I considered,
2a, was external force equal to

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:51.163
0, but center of mass was
moving, because it had a

00:39:51.163 --> 00:39:53.582
momentum.
Then, the claim is that

00:39:53.582 --> 00:39:57.327
momentum will not change.
I'm coming to the last case,

00:39:57.327 --> 00:40:00.170
which is, if you want,
case 2b.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:08.860
The external forces are 0,
the center of mass was 0;

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.190
in other words,
center of mass was at rest.

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:20.995
If you find these different
cases complicated,

00:40:20.995 --> 00:40:23.719
then I don't mind telling you
one more time.

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:26.853
The center of mass behaves like
a single object responding to

00:40:26.853 --> 00:40:29.323
the external force.
It's clear that if the external

00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:31.139
force is non-zero,
the center of mass will

00:40:31.139 --> 00:40:33.146
accelerate.
If the external force is 0,

00:40:33.146 --> 00:40:35.200
the center of mass will not
accelerate.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:39.075
There are cases 1 and 2.
2a and 2b are the following:

00:40:39.075 --> 00:40:42.690
if it does not accelerate,
its velocity will not change.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:46.265
So then, you have the two
cases, it had a velocity,

00:40:46.265 --> 00:40:49.269
which it maintained,
or it had no velocity,

00:40:49.269 --> 00:40:52.130
in which case it does not even
move.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.592
See, if you apply F = ma
to a body and there are no

00:40:55.592 --> 00:40:58.630
forces, you cannot say the body
will be at rest.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:00.699
You will say the body will
maintain the velocity.

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:03.167
So, if it had a velocity,
it'll go at the velocity,

00:41:03.167 --> 00:41:05.190
if it was at rest it'll remain
at rest;

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.170
the same goes for the center of
mass.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:10.271
If the center of mass was
moving, it'll preserve its

00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.590
momentum.
That really means the sum of

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.889
the momenta of the individual
pieces will be preserved.

00:41:15.889 --> 00:41:19.118
If it was at rest,
since the external force is 0,

00:41:19.118 --> 00:41:23.385
it will remain at rest.
So, I want to look at the

00:41:23.385 --> 00:41:27.502
consequence of this one.
I could've done them in either

00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:29.114
order.
I can take the case where

00:41:29.114 --> 00:41:31.372
there's no external force,
there is no motion,

00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:33.480
or I chose to do with the
opposite way,

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.532
where I took the most
complicated case,

00:41:35.532 --> 00:41:38.898
where external force is not 0.
Then, I took the case where it

00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:41.739
is 0 but the center of mass was
moving to begin with,

00:41:41.739 --> 00:41:44.690
and therefore it has to keep
moving no matter what.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.239
And the simplest case is the
center of mass was at rest;

00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:50.880
then, it's not moving now and
it will never move.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:55.059
So, let me give an example of
where the idea comes into play.

00:41:55.059 --> 00:41:59.797
We looked at the planetary
motion of the Sun and the Earth,

00:41:59.797 --> 00:42:03.064
and I said the Earth goes
around the Sun,

00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:06.250
so let's look at it a little
later;

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.593
there's the Earth and the only
force between the Earth and the

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.840
Sun is the mutual force of
gravitation.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:19.757
Now, my question to you is,
"Is this picture of the Sun

00:42:19.757 --> 00:42:24.377
sitting here and the Earth
moving around acceptable or not

00:42:24.377 --> 00:42:27.739
in view of what I've said?"
Yes?

00:42:27.739 --> 00:42:29.994
Student: The Sun and
Earth revolve around a mutual

00:42:29.994 --> 00:42:31.338
center of gravity.
Professor Ramamurti

00:42:31.338 --> 00:42:32.340
Shankar: Yes,
that's the answer to the

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.216
problem.
But what is wrong if I just say

00:42:34.216 --> 00:42:36.859
the Sun remains here and the
Earth goes in a circle,

00:42:36.859 --> 00:42:38.880
which is what we accepted last
time?

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.720
Student: The momentum of
the Sun doesn't change,

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.139
but it changes in the momentum
of the Earth.

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:45.410
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's one way.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.808
Do you understand what he said?
He said the momentum of the Sun

00:42:47.808 --> 00:42:50.326
is not changing.
The momentum of the Earth is

00:42:50.326 --> 00:42:53.150
changing, so the total momentum
is changing.

00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:55.886
The total momentum cannot
change, so that's not

00:42:55.886 --> 00:42:58.723
acceptable.
But in terms of center of mass,

00:42:58.723 --> 00:43:00.920
you can say something else,
yes?

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.530
Student: The center of
mass moves.

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:04.428
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It moves,

00:43:04.428 --> 00:43:06.456
maybe you can tell me,
you cannot point out from

00:43:06.456 --> 00:43:08.830
there, but tell me which way you
think it's moving.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.789
Student: In a circle.
Professor Ramamurti

00:43:10.789 --> 00:43:12.764
Shankar: Right,
in the beginning it's somewhere

00:43:12.764 --> 00:43:14.395
here.
A little later it's there,

00:43:14.395 --> 00:43:17.229
a little later it's there,
so the center of mass would do

00:43:17.229 --> 00:43:20.570
this, if the picture I gave you
last time was actually correct.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.777
So, a Sun of finite mass
staying at rest and a planet

00:43:24.777 --> 00:43:28.500
orbiting around it is simply not
acceptable,

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.510
because the center of mass is
moving without external forces;

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:35.301
that's not allowed.
Or as he said,

00:43:35.301 --> 00:43:38.149
the momentum is constantly
changing, this guy has no

00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:40.207
momentum,
that guy has the momentum that

00:43:40.207 --> 00:43:42.380
points this way now and points
that way later.

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.726
But look what I've said here:
take 1 and 2 to be the Earth

00:43:45.726 --> 00:43:48.780
and the Sun, it doesn't add up
to the same number.

00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:53.289
So, we sort of know what the
answer should be.

00:43:53.289 --> 00:43:56.695
We know that the thing that
cannot move is not the Sun and

00:43:56.695 --> 00:43:59.640
it's not the Earth.
It's the center of mass;

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.355
that's what cannot move.
If originally it was at rest,

00:44:03.355 --> 00:44:06.345
it'll remain at rest.
So, the center of mass,

00:44:06.345 --> 00:44:09.416
if it cannot move,
so let's start off the Sun

00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:13.604
here, start off the Earth here,
join them, the center of mass

00:44:13.604 --> 00:44:16.762
is somewhere here.
Actually, the Sun is so much

00:44:16.762 --> 00:44:19.979
more massive than the Earth,
the center of mass lies inside

00:44:19.979 --> 00:44:22.257
the Sun.
But I'm taking another Solar

00:44:22.257 --> 00:44:25.890
System where the Sun is a lot
bigger than the Earth but not as

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.652
big as in our world,
so I can show the center of

00:44:28.652 --> 00:44:31.170
mass here.
That cannot move.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.016
So, what that means is,
a little later,

00:44:34.016 --> 00:44:38.510
if the planet is here and I
want to keep the center there,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.782
the Sun has to be here,
and somewhat later when the

00:44:41.782 --> 00:44:44.400
planet's there the Sun has to be
here.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:48.153
So, what will happen is,
the Sun will go around on a

00:44:48.153 --> 00:44:51.979
circle of smaller radius,
the planet will go around on a

00:44:51.979 --> 00:44:55.229
circle of a bigger radius,
always around the center of

00:44:55.229 --> 00:44:57.218
mass.
So, you've got this picture

00:44:57.218 --> 00:45:00.049
now, it's like a dumbbell,
asymmetric, big guy here,

00:45:00.049 --> 00:45:02.269
small guy here,
fix that and turn it.

00:45:02.269 --> 00:45:06.210
You get a trajectory for the
Sun, and you get a trajectory

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:08.630
for the Earth on a bigger
circle;

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:12.478
the center remains fixed.
So, if you apply loss of

00:45:12.478 --> 00:45:15.346
gravity, I've given you a
homework problem,

00:45:15.346 --> 00:45:18.349
you've got to be careful about
one thing.

00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:22.710
When you apply the Law of
Gravity, you may apply it to the

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.752
Earth for example.
Then, you will say the

00:45:25.752 --> 00:45:29.603
centripetal acceleration
mv^(2) /r is the force of

00:45:29.603 --> 00:45:32.336
gravity.
When you do that calculation be

00:45:32.336 --> 00:45:34.753
careful;
v is the velocity of the

00:45:34.753 --> 00:45:37.429
planet, and when you do the
mv^(2)/r,

00:45:37.429 --> 00:45:40.067
the r you put will be
the distance to the center of

00:45:40.067 --> 00:45:44.170
mass from where you are.
That'll be the mv^(2)/r.

00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.405
But when you equate that to the
force of gravity,

00:45:46.405 --> 00:45:48.408
the Gm_1m
_2 over

00:45:48.408 --> 00:45:51.054
r^(2),
for that r it is the

00:45:51.054 --> 00:45:55.449
actual distance from the Earth
to the Sun that you should keep,

00:45:55.449 --> 00:45:57.888
because the force of gravity is
a function of the distance

00:45:57.888 --> 00:46:00.512
between the planets,
not between the planet and the

00:46:00.512 --> 00:46:03.198
center of mass.
The actual force on the Earth

00:46:03.198 --> 00:46:06.836
is really coming not from here
but on the other side of this

00:46:06.836 --> 00:46:08.859
where the Sun is.
But luckily,

00:46:08.859 --> 00:46:11.884
at every instant,
the Sun is constantly pulling

00:46:11.884 --> 00:46:14.450
it towards the center of the
circle.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.956
It's a very clever solution.
The planet moves around a

00:46:17.956 --> 00:46:20.282
circle.
It has an acceleration towards

00:46:20.282 --> 00:46:23.340
the center, and somebody's
providing that force.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.179
ut that somebody is not at the
center but always on the other

00:46:26.179 --> 00:46:28.309
side of the line joining you to
the center,

00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:31.219
so you still experience a force
towards the center.

00:46:31.219 --> 00:46:34.480
Under the action of that force,
you can show it'll have a

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.149
circular orbit and you can take
some time in calculating now the

00:46:38.149 --> 00:46:41.409
relation between time period and
radius and whatnot.

00:46:41.409 --> 00:46:42.860
So, this is called a two-body
problem.

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.222
So, this is one example where
you realize, "Hey,

00:46:49.222 --> 00:46:51.070
center of mass,
if I follow it,

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:54.197
it cannot be moving and
therefore the actual motion of

00:46:54.197 --> 00:46:56.969
planets is more complicated than
we thought."

00:46:56.969 --> 00:47:02.033
Okay, then, there is a whole
slew of problems one can do,

00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:05.739
where the center of mass is not
moving.

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:07.400
So, I'll just give you a couple
of examples;

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:09.930
then, I will stop,
but I won't do the numbers.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:15.259
Here is one example.
That is a carriage that

00:47:15.259 --> 00:47:21.343
contains a horse,
and the horse is on this far

00:47:21.343 --> 00:47:23.996
end.
And as they tell us to do,

00:47:23.996 --> 00:47:27.344
we won't draw the horse,
we'll just say it's a point

00:47:27.344 --> 00:47:30.440
mass m,
and the railway carriage is a

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.334
big mass, capital M,
and let's say the left hand of

00:47:34.334 --> 00:47:39.369
the railway carriage is here.
Now, you cannot see the horse,

00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:41.760
okay?
The horse is inside;

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.006
the horse decides to--;now,
he said, "I'm tired of sitting

00:47:45.006 --> 00:47:48.309
on this side of this room,
I'm going to the other side."

00:47:48.309 --> 00:47:50.500
The horse goes to the other
side.

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:53.041
First of all,
you will know something's going

00:47:53.041 --> 00:47:56.103
on without looking in,
because when the horse moves to

00:47:56.103 --> 00:47:59.050
the left the carriage has to
move to the right.

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:02.239
First, convince yourself the
carriage has to move somewhere

00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:05.650
because originally the center of
mass between these two objects

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:08.730
-- that one and that one -- is
something in between,

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:11.991
somewhere here.
If the horse came to that side,

00:48:11.991 --> 00:48:14.912
the center of mass is now the
average of those two,

00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:18.313
which is somewhere over there;
the center of mass has moved

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:21.260
and that's not allowed,
the center of mass cannot move.

00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:24.243
So, if the center of mass is
originally on that line,

00:48:24.243 --> 00:48:27.798
it has to remain in that line.
So, what will happen in the end

00:48:27.798 --> 00:48:31.067
is that the horse will come
here, the center of the carriage

00:48:31.067 --> 00:48:33.338
will be there,
but the center of mass will

00:48:33.338 --> 00:48:36.569
come out the same way.
So, a typical problem,

00:48:36.569 --> 00:48:42.010
you guys will be expected to
solve, will look like this.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:46.255
Given all these masses and
given the length of the

00:48:46.255 --> 00:48:50.500
carriage, find out how much the
carriage moves.

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:53.970
Do you think you can do that?
Give some numbers and plug in

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:55.725
the things.
For example,

00:48:55.725 --> 00:48:59.849
this guy is at a distance
L/2 of this;

00:48:59.849 --> 00:49:01.860
the horse is at a distance
L.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.739
Make this your origin of
coordinates.

00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:06.777
Take the weighted average of
those two, and get the x

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.579
coordinate of the center of
mass.

00:49:08.579 --> 00:49:10.921
You don't have to worry about
the y because there's

00:49:10.921 --> 00:49:12.400
nothing happening in the
y.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.410
So, the x coordinate of
that and that'll be somewhere in

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:16.836
here.
At the end of the day,

00:49:16.836 --> 00:49:19.406
let us say it has moved an
unknown distance d,

00:49:19.406 --> 00:49:21.579
which is what you're trying to
calculate.

00:49:21.579 --> 00:49:24.349
Then, compute the center of
mass.

00:49:24.349 --> 00:49:27.210
When you do that,
remember that the center of the

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:30.369
carriage is L/2 +
d from this origin.

00:49:30.369 --> 00:49:32.989
The horse is at the distance
d from the origin.

00:49:32.989 --> 00:49:36.296
Equate the center as a mass and
you will get an equation that

00:49:36.296 --> 00:49:38.280
the only unknown will be
d,

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:43.245
and you solve for a d
and it'll tell you how much it

00:49:43.245 --> 00:49:45.789
moves.
Anybody have a question about

00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:49.609
how you attack this problem?
Find the center of mass before,

00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:53.211
find the center of mass after,
equate them and that linear

00:49:53.211 --> 00:49:56.890
equation will have one unknown,
which is the d by which

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.390
the carriage has moved and you
can solve for it.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.840
Okay, here's another problem.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.380
Here is a shore,
and here is a boat;

00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:17.431
maybe I'll show the boat like a
boat, here it is,

00:50:17.431 --> 00:50:22.810
okay that's the boat.
Now, you are here.

00:50:26.829 --> 00:50:30.441
So, the boat has a certain
mass, which we can pretend is

00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:33.481
concentrated there.
You have a little mass

00:50:33.481 --> 00:50:36.803
m, and the boat is at a
distance, say,

00:50:36.803 --> 00:50:39.093
d,
from the shore,

00:50:39.093 --> 00:50:44.166
and you are at a certain
distance x from the edge

00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:48.519
of the boat,
and you want to get out, okay.

00:50:48.519 --> 00:50:51.789
You want to go to shore,
so what do you do?

00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:55.759
So, if you're Superman or
Superwoman you just take off and

00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:59.160
you land where you want.
But suppose you have limited

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:02.114
jumping capabilities.
It is very natural that you

00:51:02.114 --> 00:51:05.840
want to come as far to the left
as possible and then jump.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.591
Suppose it is true that
d, which is,

00:51:08.591 --> 00:51:11.801
say, three meters,
is the maximum you can possibly

00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:14.880
jump, whereas you cannot jump
d + x.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.643
So, you say,
"Let me go to the end and I'm

00:51:16.643 --> 00:51:18.750
safe because I can jump the
distance d."

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:24.265
And again, we know that's not
going to work because when you

00:51:24.265 --> 00:51:28.636
move--Look it's very simple.
If you move and nobody else

00:51:28.636 --> 00:51:31.943
moves we've got a problem,
because if you found the center

00:51:31.943 --> 00:51:34.090
of mass with one location for
you,

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:36.462
and you change your location
and nothing else changes,

00:51:36.462 --> 00:51:38.789
center of mass will change and
that's not allowed.

00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:42.230
Here, I'm assuming there are no
horizontal forces.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:44.106
In real life,
the water will exert a

00:51:44.106 --> 00:51:46.412
horizontal force,
but that's ignored in this

00:51:46.412 --> 00:51:48.769
calculation.
There are no horizontal forces.

00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:50.750
If you move,
everything else has to move.

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:54.143
So, what'll happen is that,
when you move,

00:51:54.143 --> 00:51:58.943
the boat will have moved from
there maybe somewhere over to

00:51:58.943 --> 00:52:02.559
the right like this.
You are certainly at the edge

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:05.819
of the boat, but the boat has
moved a little extra distance

00:52:05.819 --> 00:52:08.630
δ, and you have to find
that δ.

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:13.784
You find it by the same trick.
You find the center of mass of

00:52:13.784 --> 00:52:17.635
you and the boat,
preferably with this as the

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:20.115
origin.
You can use any origin you want

00:52:20.115 --> 00:52:22.496
for center of mass,
it's not going and it's not

00:52:22.496 --> 00:52:25.608
going according to anybody,
but it's convenient to pick the

00:52:25.608 --> 00:52:28.122
shore as your origin,
find the weighted sum of your

00:52:28.122 --> 00:52:31.138
location and your mass,
the boat's location and boat's

00:52:31.138 --> 00:52:32.707
mass.
At the end of the day,

00:52:32.707 --> 00:52:35.943
put yourself on the left hand
of the boat, and let's say it

00:52:35.943 --> 00:52:39.479
has moved a distance δ,
so the real distance now is

00:52:39.479 --> 00:52:42.869
d + δ.
That's where you are.

00:52:42.869 --> 00:52:45.860
That plus L/2 is where
the center of the boat is.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:48.728
Now, find the new center of
mass and equate them and you

00:52:48.728 --> 00:52:51.179
will find how much the boat
would have moved,

00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:55.450
and that means you have to jump
a distance d + δ.

00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:00.795
Everybody follow that?
That's another example where

00:53:00.795 --> 00:53:04.195
the center of mass doesn't move.
Now, let's ask what happens

00:53:04.195 --> 00:53:07.160
next.
So, you leap in the air, okay?

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:12.434
Now you're airborne.
What do you think is happening

00:53:12.434 --> 00:53:15.940
when you're airborne?
Yes?

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:17.690
Go ahead!
What's happening?

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.630
Student: The boat will
move the other way.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:21.980
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It'll be moving,

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:22.960
and why do you say it'll be
moving?

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.859
Student: Why?
Professor Ramamurti

00:53:24.859 --> 00:53:26.122
Shankar: Yeah.
Student: Because the

00:53:26.122 --> 00:53:27.539
center of mass still won't be
the same thing.

00:53:27.539 --> 00:53:28.186
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:29.654
there's one way to say that.
The center of mass cannot move,

00:53:29.654 --> 00:53:31.321
so if you move to the left,
the boat will move to the

00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:32.914
right.
What's the equivalent way to

00:53:32.914 --> 00:53:34.389
say that?
Yes?

00:53:34.389 --> 00:53:35.920
Student: The momentum
can't change.

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.681
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

00:53:36.681 --> 00:53:38.900
the momentum cannot change.
Originally, the momentum was 0,

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.340
nobody was moving,
but suddenly you're moving,

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.400
the boat has to move the other
way.

00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:46.446
Of course, it doesn't move with
the same velocity,

00:53:46.446 --> 00:53:49.909
or the same speed;
it moves with the same momentum.

00:53:49.909 --> 00:53:53.051
So, the big M of the
boat times the small v of

00:53:53.051 --> 00:53:55.927
the boat, will equal your small
m times your big

00:53:55.927 --> 00:53:57.484
V.
In other words,

00:53:57.484 --> 00:54:00.885
you, unless you move with a big
speed, the boat moves with a

00:54:00.885 --> 00:54:03.182
small speed;
then, these two numbers in

00:54:03.182 --> 00:54:06.268
magnitude will be equal.
So, if you're going on one of

00:54:06.268 --> 00:54:08.800
the big cruise ships,
you jump on the shore,

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.039
you're not going to notice the
movement of the ship,

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:14.640
but it technically speaking
does move the other way.

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:19.279
Okay, you're airborne, okay.
Then, a few seconds later you

00:54:19.279 --> 00:54:22.190
collapse on the shore;
you're right there.

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:23.790
Now, what's happening to the
boat?

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:28.219
Is it going to stop now?
Your momentum is 0, yes?

00:54:28.219 --> 00:54:32.401
Student: But you've been
stopped by the force of the

00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:33.660
ground.
Professor Ramamurti

00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:35.530
Shankar: Yes.
Everybody agree?

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:38.187
I will repeat that answer,
but you should all have figured

00:54:38.187 --> 00:54:40.539
this out.
The boat will not stop just

00:54:40.539 --> 00:54:43.324
because you hit the shore.
The boat will keep moving

00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:44.760
because there's no force on the
boat;

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.801
it's going to keep moving.
The question is,

00:54:46.801 --> 00:54:49.515
"How come I suddenly have
momentum in my system when I had

00:54:49.515 --> 00:54:52.058
no momentum before?"
It's because the F

00:54:52.058 --> 00:54:55.494
external has now come into play.
Previously, it was just you and

00:54:55.494 --> 00:54:58.150
the boat and you couldn't change
your total momentum.

00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:00.598
But the ground is now pushing
you, and it's obviously pushing

00:55:00.598 --> 00:55:03.006
you to the right because you
were flying to the left and you

00:55:03.006 --> 00:55:05.003
were stopped.
So, your combined system,

00:55:05.003 --> 00:55:07.402
you and the boat,
have a rightward force acting

00:55:07.402 --> 00:55:09.280
for the time it took to stop
you;

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.989
it's that momentum that's
carried by the boat.

00:55:12.989 --> 00:55:16.158
A better way to say this is,
you and the boat exchange

00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:18.670
momenta, you push the boat to
the right,

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.896
you move to the left,
and your momentum is killed by

00:55:20.896 --> 00:55:23.398
the shore.
The boat, no reason to change,

00:55:23.398 --> 00:55:26.367
and keeps going.
So, can you calculate how fast

00:55:26.367 --> 00:55:27.600
the boat is moving?

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.281
Can anybody tell me how to
calculate how fast the boat is

00:55:33.281 --> 00:55:33.640
moving?

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:42.791
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:55:42.791 --> 00:55:45.951
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: But I'm on the

00:55:45.951 --> 00:55:47.710
shore now.
I've fallen on the shore.

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:49.269
I'm asking how fast the boat is
moving.

00:55:49.269 --> 00:55:53.003
Student: The boat is
moving as fast as [inaudible]

00:55:53.003 --> 00:55:55.736
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

00:55:55.736 --> 00:55:58.269
I think he's got the right
answer.

00:55:58.269 --> 00:56:01.328
If I only told you that I
jumped and landed on the shore,

00:56:01.328 --> 00:56:04.550
that's not enough to predict
how fast the boat is moving.

00:56:04.550 --> 00:56:07.915
But if I told you my velocity
when I was airborne,

00:56:07.915 --> 00:56:11.555
then of course I know my
momentum and you can find the

00:56:11.555 --> 00:56:16.019
boat momentum and that's the
velocity it will retain forever.

00:56:16.019 --> 00:56:18.309
So, you need more information
than simply saying,

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:21.344
"I jumped to the shore."
It depends with what velocity I

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:23.659
left the boat and landed on the
ground.

00:56:23.659 --> 00:56:26.522
If I leap really hard,
the boat will go really fast

00:56:26.522 --> 00:56:30.738
the opposite way.
Okay, that's the end of this

00:56:30.738 --> 00:56:34.650
family of center of mass
problems.

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:39.530
So, I'm going to another class
of problems.

00:56:42.579 --> 00:56:45.913
This involves a rocket,
and it's going to derive the

00:56:45.913 --> 00:56:48.227
rocket equation.
A rocket is something everybody

00:56:48.227 --> 00:56:50.539
understands but it's a little
more complicated than you think.

00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:53.279
Everyone knows you blow up a
balloon, you let it go,

00:56:53.279 --> 00:56:56.372
the balloon goes one way,
the air goes the other way,

00:56:56.372 --> 00:56:59.900
action and reaction are equal,
even lay people know that.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.177
Or, if you stand on a frozen
lake and you take a gun and you

00:57:04.177 --> 00:57:07.055
fire something,
but then the bullet goes one

00:57:07.055 --> 00:57:10.698
way and you go the opposite way,
again, because of conservation

00:57:10.698 --> 00:57:13.061
of momentum.
The rocket is a little more

00:57:13.061 --> 00:57:16.079
subtle and I just want to
mention a few aspects of it.

00:57:16.079 --> 00:57:18.440
I don't want to go into the
rocket problem in any detail.

00:57:18.440 --> 00:57:21.449
It's good for you to know how
these things are done.

00:57:21.449 --> 00:57:25.479
Here's a rocket whose mass at
this instant is M,

00:57:25.479 --> 00:57:28.389
whose velocity is v
right now.

00:57:28.389 --> 00:57:33.289
What rockets do is they emit
gasses, and the gasses have a

00:57:33.289 --> 00:57:36.760
certain exhaust velocity.
That velocity is called

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:38.733
v_0.
In magnitude,

00:57:38.733 --> 00:57:42.699
it's pointing away from the
rocket, and it has a fixed value

00:57:42.699 --> 00:57:46.329
relative to the rocket,
not relative to the ground.

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:48.984
If you are riding with the
rocket and you look at the fumes

00:57:48.984 --> 00:57:51.272
coming out of the back,
they will be leaving you at

00:57:51.272 --> 00:57:55.239
that speed v_0.
A short time later--What

00:57:55.239 --> 00:58:00.556
happens a short time later,
the rocket has a mass M -

00:58:00.556 --> 00:58:06.743
δ because it's lost some of
its own body mass in the form of

00:58:06.743 --> 00:58:09.908
exhaust fumes.
The exhaust fumes,

00:58:09.908 --> 00:58:14.485
I'm just showing them as a blob
here, and the rocket's velocity

00:58:14.485 --> 00:58:17.659
now is not v,
but v + Δv.

00:58:17.659 --> 00:58:20.719
And what's the velocity of the
fumes?

00:58:20.719 --> 00:58:22.329
Here's where you've got to be
careful.

00:58:22.329 --> 00:58:24.483
If your velocity was v
at that instant,

00:58:24.483 --> 00:58:27.258
the velocity of the rocket
fume, with respect to the ground

00:58:27.258 --> 00:58:30.558
is v - v_0;
that's the part you've got to

00:58:30.558 --> 00:58:31.290
understand.

00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:37.280
The rocket has a smaller mass
and bigger velocity;

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.048
everyone understands that.
But what's the momentum of the

00:58:41.048 --> 00:58:45.130
gas leaving the rocket if the
mass is δ?

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:48.594
But what is its velocity?
Its velocity with respect to

00:58:48.594 --> 00:58:52.159
the rocket is pointing to the
left of v_0,

00:58:52.159 --> 00:58:55.039
but the rocket itself is going
to the right at speed v.

00:58:55.039 --> 00:58:56.771
So, the speed as seen from the
ground will be v -

00:58:56.771 --> 00:58:57.450
v_0.

00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:13.069
So, the Law of Conservation of
Momentum will say Mv = (M -

00:59:13.069 --> 00:59:21.400
δ) (v + Δv) + δ(v -
v_0).

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:24.369
This is, the momentum before
and the momentum after are

00:59:24.369 --> 00:59:27.412
equal.
So, you open out this bracket

00:59:27.412 --> 00:59:32.348
you get -- sorry my letters
better be uniform -- this is

00:59:32.348 --> 00:59:38.383
Mv, then -vδ.
I don't want to call it

00:59:38.383 --> 00:59:47.012
δv, I want to call it
vδ + MΔv - (δ) (Δv ) + δv -

00:59:47.012 --> 00:59:50.760
v_0δ.
I want to call it vδ.

00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:53.445
The reason I want to put the
δ on the right is you

00:59:53.445 --> 00:59:55.729
may get confused.
δ usually stands for

00:59:55.729 --> 00:59:58.309
the change of something,
so that's not what I mean.

00:59:58.309 --> 01:00:02.579
So, you cancel this Mv
and you cancel this Mv.

01:00:02.579 --> 01:00:07.829
You cancel this vδ and
that vδ.

01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:11.141
This one you ignore because
it's the product of two

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:14.188
infinitesimals,
one is the amount of gas in the

01:00:14.188 --> 01:00:17.345
small time δt,
the other is infinitesimal

01:00:17.345 --> 01:00:20.333
change in velocity;
we keep things which are linear

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:24.156
in this.
Then, you get the result

01:00:24.156 --> 01:00:30.300
MΔv = v_0
times δ.

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:39.932
So, I'm going to write it as
Δv/v_0 = δ

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:41.530
over M.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.049
This is the relation between
the change in the velocity of

01:00:49.049 --> 01:00:51.398
the rocket;
the velocity of the exhaust

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:55.044
gases seen by the rocket,
the amount emitted in the small

01:00:55.044 --> 01:00:57.909
time divided by the mass at that
instant.

01:00:57.909 --> 01:01:02.555
But in the sense of calculus,
what is the change [dM]

01:01:02.555 --> 01:01:07.054
in the mass of the rocket?
If M is the mass of the

01:01:07.054 --> 01:01:11.415
rocket, what would you call this
a change, the mass of the

01:01:11.415 --> 01:01:16.300
rocket, in this short time?
Yep?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:17.977
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:01:17.977 --> 01:01:19.585
Shankar: No,
no, no, in terms of the symbols

01:01:19.585 --> 01:01:21.400
here what's the change in the
mass of the rocket?

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.278
Student: δ
Professor Ramamurti

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.134
Shankar: It's δ,
but it's really speaking

01:01:24.134 --> 01:01:27.478
-δ. You could keep track
of the sign, the change in the

01:01:27.478 --> 01:01:30.862
variable is really negative,
and delta here stands for a

01:01:30.862 --> 01:01:34.707
positive number.
So, if you remember that,

01:01:34.707 --> 01:01:40.390
you'll write this -dM/M.
Now, the rest is simple

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.922
mathematics.
I don't want to do this,

01:01:42.922 --> 01:01:46.119
but if you integrate this side
and you integrate that side,

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:48.489
and you know dM/M is a
logarithm;

01:01:48.489 --> 01:01:55.016
you will find the result that
the v at any time is

01:01:55.016 --> 01:02:01.427
v final = v
initial plus--or maybe I might

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:08.228
as well do this integral here.
This integral will be v

01:02:08.228 --> 01:02:12.958
final - v initial over
v_0,

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:18.539
will be the log of M
initial over M final.

01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:22.589
So, you will find final is
v initial +

01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:27.559
v_0 log
M initial over M

01:02:27.559 --> 01:02:29.869
final.
I'm doing it rather fast

01:02:29.869 --> 01:02:33.402
because I'm not that interested
in following this equation any

01:02:33.402 --> 01:02:35.286
further.
It's not a key equation like

01:02:35.286 --> 01:02:36.800
what I've been talking about
now.

01:02:41.639 --> 01:02:44.068
So, this is just to show you
how we can apply the Law of

01:02:44.068 --> 01:02:46.477
Conservation of Momentum.
I'm not going to hold you

01:02:46.477 --> 01:02:49.010
responsible in any great detail
for the derivation,

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:51.822
but that is a formula that
tells you the velocity of the

01:02:51.822 --> 01:02:54.472
rocket at any instant,
if you knew the mass at that

01:02:54.472 --> 01:02:54.930
instant.

01:03:00.130 --> 01:03:03.417
The rocket will pick up speed
and its mass will keep going

01:03:03.417 --> 01:03:06.820
down, and the log of the mass
before to the mass after times

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.050
v_0 is the
change in the velocity of the

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.925
rocket.
Okay, so I have to give you

01:03:12.925 --> 01:03:16.940
some more ammunition to do your
homework problems;

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.469
so, I'm going to discuss the
last and final topic,

01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:21.380
which is the subject of
collisions.

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:26.748
So, we're going to take the
collision of two bodies,

01:03:26.748 --> 01:03:30.476
one body, another body,
m_1v

01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:32.668
_1,
m_2v

01:03:32.668 --> 01:03:34.860
_2,
they collide.

01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:38.087
At the end of the day,
you can have the same two

01:03:38.087 --> 01:03:41.794
bodies moving at some velocities
v_1',

01:03:41.794 --> 01:03:45.355
v_2'.
Our goal is to find the final

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:47.850
velocities;
that's a goal of physics.

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:50.778
I tell you what's happening now.
I'm asking you what's happening

01:03:50.778 --> 01:03:52.825
later.
So here, there are two

01:03:52.825 --> 01:03:56.666
conditions you need because
you're trying to find two

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:58.993
unknowns, right?
We want two unknowns,

01:03:58.993 --> 01:04:01.706
I need two equations.
One equation always true,

01:04:01.706 --> 01:04:04.500
so let me write that down,
always true.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:13.857
Always true is the condition
that the momentum before is the

01:04:13.857 --> 01:04:18.385
momentum after,
m_1v_1'

01:04:18.385 --> 01:04:22.309
+ m_2v&lt;s
ub&gt;2'.

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:26.222
You need a second equation to
solve for the two unknowns,

01:04:26.222 --> 01:04:30.344
and that's where there are two
extreme cases for which I can

01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:37.638
give you the second equation,
the one extreme case is called

01:04:37.638 --> 01:04:41.862
"Totally inelastic."
In a totally inelastic

01:04:41.862 --> 01:04:43.260
collision, the two masses stick
together.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:45.288
That means
v_1' and

01:04:45.288 --> 01:04:47.721
v_2' are not
two unknowns,

01:04:47.721 --> 01:04:49.750
but a single unknown v'.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:56.347
Then, it's very easy to solve
for the momentum,

01:04:56.347 --> 01:04:58.550
because they stick together and
move as a unit.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:04.265
So, you can write here that is
equal to (m_1 +

01:05:04.265 --> 01:05:08.214
m_2) v',
so you get v ‘=

01:05:08.214 --> 01:05:12.096
(m_1v_1 +
m_2v_2

01:05:12.096 --> 01:05:15.820
)/(m_1 +
m_2).

01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:22.037
That's a simple case:
two things hit,

01:05:22.037 --> 01:05:25.309
stick together,
and move at a common speed.

01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:28.394
The common speed should be such
that the total momentum agrees

01:05:28.394 --> 01:05:31.380
with what you had before.
That's called "total Inelastic."

01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.740
The other category is called
"totally elastic."

01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:40.783
In a totally elastic collision,
the kinetic energy is

01:05:40.783 --> 01:05:41.460
conserved.

01:05:46.679 --> 01:05:51.676
That you can write as the
following relation involving

01:05:51.676 --> 01:05:53.750
quadratic things,
½

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:56.955
m_1v_1^(2) +
½

01:05:56.955 --> 01:06:00.160
m_2v_2^(2) =
½

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:05.439
m_1v_1^('2)
+ ½ m_2v_2

01:06:05.439 --> 01:06:08.873
^('2).
You can, it turns out,

01:06:08.873 --> 01:06:11.152
juggle this equation and that
equation and solve for

01:06:11.152 --> 01:06:13.700
v_1^(') and
v_2^(').

01:06:18.989 --> 01:06:20.420
Well, I'll tell you what the
answer is.

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:22.179
I don't expect you to keep
solving it.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:25.529
The answer is that
v_1^(') =

01:06:25.529 --> 01:06:29.465
(m_1 -
m_2)/(m_1 +

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:34.574
m_2)v_1 + (2
m_2/m_1 +

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.840
m_2)v&lt;
sub&gt;2.

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.804
These are no great secrets;
you'll find them in any

01:06:39.804 --> 01:06:41.636
textbook.
If you cannot follow my

01:06:41.636 --> 01:06:45.022
handwriting or you're running
out of time, just what you

01:06:45.022 --> 01:06:48.778
should be understanding now is
that there are formulae for the

01:06:48.778 --> 01:06:52.350
final velocity when the
collision is totally elastic,

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:55.399
or totally inelastic.
If they're totally inelastic,

01:06:55.399 --> 01:06:58.070
it's what I wrote there,
v^(') is something.

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.659
The totally elastic you have a
formula like this one.

01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:04.010
So, here you just replace
everywhere;

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:09.986
you saw an m_1
you put an m_2,

01:07:09.986 --> 01:07:14.159
2m_1 over
m_1 +

01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:18.524
m_2v_1.
Don't waste too much time

01:07:18.524 --> 01:07:20.121
writing this.
I think you can go home and

01:07:20.121 --> 01:07:22.039
fill in the blanks;
it's in all the books.

01:07:22.039 --> 01:07:24.851
What you carry in your head is
there's enough data to solve

01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:27.130
this, because I will tell you
the two bodies,

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:29.121
I'll tell you their masses,
I'll tell you the initial

01:07:29.121 --> 01:07:31.161
velocities;
so plug in the numbers you get

01:07:31.161 --> 01:07:33.642
the final velocity.
So, remember this,

01:07:33.642 --> 01:07:38.159
elastic, inelastic collision,
this is in one dimension.

01:07:38.159 --> 01:07:42.251
Now, I'll give you a typical
problem where you have to be

01:07:42.251 --> 01:07:46.489
very careful in using the Law of
Conservation of Energy.

01:07:46.489 --> 01:07:49.620
You cannot use the Law of
Conservation of Energy in an

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:52.755
inelastic collision.
In fact, I ask you to check if

01:07:52.755 --> 01:07:55.813
two bodies--Take two bodies
identical with opposite

01:07:55.813 --> 01:07:58.679
velocities;
the total momentum is 0.

01:07:58.679 --> 01:08:00.969
They slam, they sit together as
a lump.

01:08:00.969 --> 01:08:04.030
They've got no kinetic energy
in the end.

01:08:04.030 --> 01:08:06.900
In the beginning,
they both had kinetic energy.

01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:10.382
So, kinetic energy is not
conserved in a totally inelastic

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:13.010
collision, in an elastic
collision it is.

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:16.086
So, here is an example that
tells you how to do this

01:08:16.086 --> 01:08:19.652
carefully.
So, this is called a Ballistic

01:08:19.652 --> 01:08:22.198
Pendulum.
So, if you have a pistol -- you

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.984
manufactured a pistol -- the
bullet's coming out of the

01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:27.467
pistol at a certain speed,
and you want to tell the

01:08:27.467 --> 01:08:29.840
customer what the speed is.
How do you find it?

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:33.370
Well, nowadays we can measure
these things phenomenally well

01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:36.421
with all kinds of fancy
techniques, down to 10^(-10)

01:08:36.421 --> 01:08:37.950
seconds.
In the old days,

01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:41.399
this is the trick people had.
You go and hang a chunk of wood

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:45.542
from the ceiling.
Then, you fire the bullet with

01:08:45.542 --> 01:08:51.890
some speed v_0
and you know its mass exactly.

01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:55.770
The bullet comes,
rams into this chunk.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:59.119
I cannot draw one more picture,
so you guys imagine now.

01:08:59.119 --> 01:09:02.594
The bullet is embedded in this,
and I think you also know

01:09:02.594 --> 01:09:06.131
intuitively the minute it's
embedded, the whole thing sets

01:09:06.131 --> 01:09:08.503
in motion.
Now, you could put this on a

01:09:08.503 --> 01:09:09.789
table.
Forget all the rope.

01:09:09.789 --> 01:09:12.355
If you can find the speed of
the entire combination,

01:09:12.355 --> 01:09:15.322
then by using Conservation of
Momentum, you can find out the

01:09:15.322 --> 01:09:18.180
speed of the bullet.
But that's hard to measure;

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:19.980
people have a much cleverer
idea.

01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:22.880
You should ram into this thing.
This is like a pendulum.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.937
So, the pendulum rises up now
to a certain maximum height that

01:09:26.937 --> 01:09:30.603
you can easily measure.
And from that maximum height

01:09:30.603 --> 01:09:33.680
you can calculate the speed of
the bullet.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.476
So, I'm going to conclude by
telling you what equations

01:09:37.476 --> 01:09:40.430
you're allowed to use in the two
stages;

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.699
so pay attention and then we're
done.

01:09:42.699 --> 01:09:45.548
In the first collision,
when the bullet rammed into

01:09:45.548 --> 01:09:48.909
this block, you cannot use Law
of Conservation of Energy.

01:09:48.909 --> 01:09:51.434
In other words,
you might be naive and say,

01:09:51.434 --> 01:09:54.619
"Look, I don't care about what
happened in between;

01:09:54.619 --> 01:09:57.559
finally, I've got a certain
energy, M + m times

01:09:57.559 --> 01:10:00.387
g times h,
that's my potential energy,

01:10:00.387 --> 01:10:02.917
not kinetic."
Initially, I had ½

01:10:02.917 --> 01:10:06.777
m_0^(2).
I equate these two guys and I

01:10:06.777 --> 01:10:09.090
found v_0;
that would be wrong.

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:12.523
That's wrong because you cannot
use the Law of Conservation of

01:10:12.523 --> 01:10:15.731
Energy in this process when I
tell you that it's a totally

01:10:15.731 --> 01:10:17.869
inelastic collision in the
middle.

01:10:17.869 --> 01:10:20.357
Because, what'll happen is,
some energy will go into

01:10:20.357 --> 01:10:22.869
heating up the block;
it might even catch fire if the

01:10:22.869 --> 01:10:25.925
bullet's going too fast.
But you can use the Law of

01:10:25.925 --> 01:10:30.539
Conservation of Momentum all the
time in the first collision to

01:10:30.539 --> 01:10:34.930
deduce that M + m times
some intermediate velocity is

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:38.869
the incoming momentum.
You understand that?

01:10:38.869 --> 01:10:41.916
From that, you can find the
velocity v with which

01:10:41.916 --> 01:10:44.021
this composite thing,
block and bullet,

01:10:44.021 --> 01:10:46.589
will start moving.
Once they start moving,

01:10:46.589 --> 01:10:49.287
it's like a pendulum with the
initial momentum,

01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.678
or energy.
It can climb up to the top and

01:10:51.678 --> 01:10:54.174
convert the potential to
kinetic, or kinetic to

01:10:54.174 --> 01:10:56.997
potential.
There is no loss of energy in

01:10:56.997 --> 01:11:00.363
that process.
Therefore, if you extract this

01:11:00.363 --> 01:11:04.582
velocity and took ½ (M +
m) times this velocity

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:09.270
squared, you may in fact equate
that to (M + m)gh.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.930
So, let me summarize this last
result.

01:11:16.930 --> 01:11:19.409
In every collision,
no matter what,

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:23.189
momentum is conserved;
the energy may or may not be.

01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:25.646
And if I give you a problem
like this where in between

01:11:25.646 --> 01:11:28.194
there's some funny business
going on which is not energy

01:11:28.194 --> 01:11:30.584
conserving,
don't use energy conservation

01:11:30.584 --> 01:11:33.430
from start to finish.
Use momentum conservation,

01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:35.829
find the speed of the composite
object.

01:11:35.829 --> 01:11:38.650
This is what you've got to
understand in your head.

01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:41.134
It's not this equation.
When can I use Conservation of

01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:43.050
Mechanical Energy?
When can I not?

01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.555
A bullet driving into a chunk
of wood, you better know you

01:11:45.555 --> 01:11:47.489
cannot use Conservation of
Kinetic Energy.

01:11:47.489 --> 01:12:06.770
But once the combination is
going up, trading kinetic for

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:08.103
potential, you can.

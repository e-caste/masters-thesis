Professor Amy
Hungerford: We finished

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:07.485
Black Boy last time,
and one of the big questions

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10.362
coming out of my discussion of
that autobiography is:

00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:13.794
how do you manage the question
of context in reading a novel or

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.340
an autobiography--in reading any
text?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.685
And we had a very complex
publishing history to think

00:00:21.685 --> 00:00:26.306
about with that text.
Flannery O'Connor's work raises

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:30.600
questions of a similar kind,
but they look very different.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.820
And so, my lectures on Flannery
O'Connor will highlight the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.220
methodologies that we can bring
to any reading of a novel,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.729
and it will highlight the
differences between different

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:50.488
methodologies and what they
allow us to see in a different

00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:52.860
text.
Flannery O'Connor,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.690
as most of you probably know,
is a Southern writer.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.351
She is very often assimilated
to a whole group of southern

00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.306
writers who were working in the
1930s and '40s,

00:01:03.306 --> 00:01:07.575
the "Southern Agrarians."
She was friends with a lot of

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:12.221
the major figures of that
movement, especially Allen Tate

00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:16.369
and Caroline Gordon.
She lived out her life mostly

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.150
in a small town called
Milledgeville,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.536
Georgia.
She was born in Savannah in

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:25.295
1925.
She studied writing at the Iowa

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:28.779
Writers Workshop.
She lived in New York for a

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:32.380
short time, but she was
afflicted with lupus,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.636
a very serious illness,
and she died at the age of 39

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:39.890
in 1964.
So, she lived a pretty short

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.056
life.
Over the course of that life,

00:01:42.056 --> 00:01:45.567
she wrote mostly short stories,
and so she is very much known

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:48.940
for her short stories.
She has a couple of novels.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.840
Of them, this is,
I think, the most successful.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.908
O'Connor,
you may also know,

00:01:58.908 --> 00:02:02.640
has been understood as a
religious writer.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.831
She was a Catholic,
and she very much made her

00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:12.605
Catholicism at the center of all
the things that she said about

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:17.471
her fictional practice.
And so, we're going to see a

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:22.256
couple of those things today.
Let's look--just to begin with,

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:25.840
if you brought your
books--let's look at the cover

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.349
of this book.
What does this cover say to you?

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.350
What does this image remind you
of?

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.550
What does it look like to you?
Do you want to answer that?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.822
Student:
Is it the Sacred

00:02:36.822 --> 00:02:38.894
Heart?Professor Amy
Hungerford: It's the Sacred

00:02:38.894 --> 00:02:41.220
Heart, yes.
It's the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.292
In Catholic iconography of a
certain kind,

00:02:46.292 --> 00:02:53.715
the figure of Christ is shown
usually parting His clothes and

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:59.530
His flesh and showing you His
Sacred Heart,

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:06.393
which is usually crowned with
flame and often encircled with

00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:10.578
thorns.
So it's an image of Christ the

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:14.031
suffering godhead:
the very human,

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:19.576
fleshly person who will part
His own flesh in order to

00:03:19.576 --> 00:03:24.540
connect with,
in order to redeem,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.039
the believer.
So right in the packaging of

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:33.180
this novel that we have
today--this cover has changed

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.299
over time--nevertheless,
even today, that very Catholic

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.449
iconography is right on the
front of the cover.

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.902
And when you see Wise Blood,
that title,

00:03:43.902 --> 00:03:48.211
right below the Sacred Heart,
you can't help but think of:

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:51.680
well, this blood is somehow the
blood of Christ.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.780
That's the kind of blood we're
talking about.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.113
It's already entered a sort of
metaphorical register,

00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:59.806
religious register,
in the way this book is

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:03.240
packaged.
Then, when we open up the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.752
front, we see the author's note
to the second edition,

00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:15.199
and this was something O'Connor
added to the novel in 1962.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.260
I just want to read that with
you today.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.257
She says: 
Wise Blood has

00:04:22.257 --> 00:04:24.610
reached the age of ten and is
still alive.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.038
My critical powers are just
sufficient to determine this,

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:30.610
and I am gratified to be able
to say it.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.913
The book was written with zest,
and if possible it should be

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:36.430
read that way.
It is a comic novel about a

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.947
Christian malgrÃ©
lui, and as such very

00:04:39.947 --> 00:04:42.806
serious.
For all comic novels that are

00:04:42.806 --> 00:04:46.560
any good must be about matters
of life and death.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.127
Wise Blood was written
by an author congenitally

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:52.704
innocent of theory,
but one with certain

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:55.699
preoccupations.
That belief in Christ is to

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.628
some a matter of life and death
has been a stumbling block for

00:04:59.628 --> 00:05:03.235
readers who would prefer to
think it a matter of no great

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:06.097
consequence.
For them, Hazel Motes's

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:10.479
integrity lies in his trying
with such vigor to get rid of

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.321
the ragged figure who moves from
tree to tree in the back of his

00:05:15.321 --> 00:05:17.410
mind.
For the author,

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.779
Hazel's integrity lies in his
not being able to do so.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.756
So, right up front,
we are told that Hazel Motes is

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:33.396
a Christian in spite of himself,
that this is how we are to

00:05:33.396 --> 00:05:37.910
understand this character who we
will come to know.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.064
I also want to give another
layer to this understanding of

00:05:42.064 --> 00:05:46.436
O'Connor as a religious writer
by looking at what she said in

00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:50.663
her correspondence to one of her
readers who asked her some

00:05:50.663 --> 00:05:55.537
questions,
and this is on the handout that

00:05:55.537 --> 00:05:59.541
I passed around.
This is a letter to a man

00:05:59.541 --> 00:06:03.237
named Ben Griffith from 1954.
So she had just finished

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:07.379
Wise Blood, and
people are starting to read it,

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.980
ask her questions.
She was a prolific

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.378
correspondent.
She was very generous in her

00:06:12.378 --> 00:06:14.725
letter writing.
She would write to almost

00:06:14.725 --> 00:06:17.791
anyone who wrote to her.
She would write back in a

00:06:17.791 --> 00:06:20.699
substantive way.
I think it's in part that,

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:24.274
suffering from lupus,
she was very much confined to

00:06:24.274 --> 00:06:27.692
her house in Georgia,
and the letter writing,

00:06:27.692 --> 00:06:31.987
this kind of correspondence,
was certainly a way for her to

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:36.577
keep in contact with the world
of readers and other writers and

00:06:36.577 --> 00:06:38.610
friends.
So he had written to her.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.060
He was teaching writing at a
local college.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.674
He's obviously been asking her
about the sources of some of the

00:06:48.674 --> 00:06:52.579
images and characters and themes
in Wise Blood. So,

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:54.670
I want to point out a couple of
things.

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.470
This is the first full
paragraph:

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:01.271
I don't know how to cure
the sourcitis,

00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:04.964
except to tell you that I can
discover a good many possible

00:07:04.964 --> 00:07:07.319
sources myself for Wise
Blood,

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:11.623
but I am often embarrassed
to find that I read the sources

00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:14.842
after I had written the book.
I have been exposed to

00:07:14.842 --> 00:07:17.517
Wordsworth's Intimation
Ode, but that is all

00:07:17.517 --> 00:07:19.625
I can say about it.
I have one of those

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:23.360
food-chopper brains that nothing
comes out of the way it went in.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.050
The Oedipus business
comes nearer to home.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.724
Of course, Haze Motes is not an
Oedipus figure,

00:07:29.724 --> 00:07:32.290
but there are obvious
resemblances.

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.627
At the time I was writing the
last of the book,

00:07:34.627 --> 00:07:37.220
I was living in Connecticut
[actually very close,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.517
here at Yale,
and one of the people who is

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:44.055
still at Yale,
Penny Laurens--I don't know if

00:07:44.055 --> 00:07:48.640
you've met her--she was married
to Robert Fitzgerald,

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.731
and she knew Flannery O'Connor].
When I was living in

00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:56.100
Connecticut with the Robert
Fitzgeralds, Robert Fitzgerald

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.350
translated the Theban Cycle
with Dudley Fitz,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.681
and the translation of
Oedipus Rex had just come

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:04.839
out and I was much taken with
it.

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:08.054
Anyway, all I can say is I did
a lot of thinking about

00:08:08.054 --> 00:08:08.721
Oedipus.

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:13.250
This is very typical in tone
for O'Connor.

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:16.060
When she talks about education
or learning--and if you read

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.920
more in this letter (I won't go
through the whole thing),

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:23.250
you will see that--she's very
self-deprecating.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.125
She says she has "what passes
for an education in this day and

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:29.022
age."
She says that she has read a

00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:31.980
little bit of Kafka and "doesn't
know what to make of him,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.899
but it makes you a bolder
writer."

00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:36.521
She reads a little Henry James
because she thinks that makes

00:08:36.521 --> 00:08:38.742
her a better writer,
somehow, but she doesn't quite

00:08:38.742 --> 00:08:42.256
know how.
There's always this veneer of

00:08:42.256 --> 00:08:48.230
innocence, or lack of learning,
or lack of sophistication;

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.649
so, she is presenting herself
as a simple person.

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:57.860
I think that's important,
although not directly connected

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.919
to her presentation of herself
as a Catholic person.

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:06.290
I think it does factor into her
sense that the truth she is

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.736
accessing, or the truth that she
is trying to present to the

00:09:10.736 --> 00:09:15.433
world in her stories,
is one that even a child might

00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:20.009
be able to understand.
And that fits very comfortably

00:09:20.009 --> 00:09:24.363
within a New Testament
understanding of the teaching of

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.767
Christ.
So, Christ is that one to whom

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:32.961
the little children can come,
and I think she cultivates that

00:09:32.961 --> 00:09:36.769
childlike sense in her
self-presentation.

00:09:36.769 --> 00:09:40.742
But then there is this very
explicit discussion of her

00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:43.590
Catholicism, a little further
down:

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.080
My background and my
inclinations are both Catholic,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.019
and I think this is very
apparent in the book.

00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.539
Something is usually said about
Kafka in connection with Wise

00:09:52.539 --> 00:09:54.940
Blood, but I have
never succeeded in making my way

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.940
through The Castle or
The Trial,

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.250
and I wouldn't pretend to know
anything about Kafka.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.340
I think reading a little of him
perhaps makes you a bolder

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.950
writer 
Ã¢â¬Â¦And so on.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:09.556
If you turn over,
this is another letter to Ben

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:16.259
Griffith written fairly shortly
after this first one.

00:10:16.259 --> 00:10:21.190
She expands a little bit on
this sense of her Catholicism.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.059
This is in the middle of the
page:

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:26.960
Let me assure you that no
one but a Catholic could have

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.990
written Wise Blood even
though it is a book about a kind

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.478
of Protestant saint.
It reduces Protestantism to the

00:10:34.478 --> 00:10:38.211
twin ultimate absurdities of the
Church without Christ or the

00:10:38.211 --> 00:10:40.700
Holy Church of Christ without
Christ,

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.696
which no pious Protestant would
do, and of course no unbeliever

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:50.129
or agnostic could have written
it because it is entirely

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:54.654
redemption centered in thought.
Not too many people are willing

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:58.065
to see this, and perhaps it is
hard to see, because Hazel Motes

00:10:58.065 --> 00:11:01.984
is such an admirable nihilist.
His nihilism leads him back to

00:11:01.984 --> 00:11:06.053
the fact of his redemption,
however, which is what he would

00:11:06.053 --> 00:11:08.789
have liked so much to get away
from.

00:11:08.789 --> 00:11:12.042
When you start describing the
significance of a symbol like

00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:14.230
the tunnel, which recurs in the
book,

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.578
you immediately begin to limit
it, and a symbol should go on

00:11:17.578 --> 00:11:19.896
deepening.
Everything should have a wider

00:11:19.896 --> 00:11:22.095
significance.
But I am a novelist,

00:11:22.095 --> 00:11:25.038
not a critic,
and I can excuse myself from

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:28.340
explication de texte on
that ground.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:30.279
The real reason of course is
laziness.

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:35.490
There is that characteristic
self-deprecation.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.883
With letters like this--which
were published copiously in a

00:11:41.883 --> 00:11:48.386
beautiful edition that Sally
Fitzgerald edited--with letters

00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:51.455
like this,
or her frequent essays and

00:11:51.455 --> 00:11:54.974
lectures, which are collected in
a book called Mystery and

00:11:54.974 --> 00:11:57.279
Manners,
she was expounding a

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:01.082
certain reading of her fiction,
even while she was still

00:12:01.082 --> 00:12:04.164
writing it.
And those who were close to her

00:12:04.164 --> 00:12:07.642
have picked up that
understanding of her fiction and

00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:11.700
promulgated it.
And there's a huge critical

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:17.466
industry around Flannery
O'Connor, and at the core of it

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:22.918
is a body of criticism that
finds and articulates and

00:12:22.918 --> 00:12:28.159
explains the religious meanings
of her texts.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:33.050
With that in mind,
I want to point up to the two

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.420
quotations that I put on the
board to start us off today:

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.501
"'I like his eyes.
They don't look like they see

00:12:42.501 --> 00:12:45.900
what he's looking at,
but they keep on looking.'"

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:50.595
This is Sabbath Lily Hawks.
And then, a character you

00:12:50.595 --> 00:12:54.855
haven't met yet if you stopped
at page 100, Onnie Jay Holy:

00:12:54.855 --> 00:12:59.188
"'I wouldn't have you believe
nothing you can't feel in your

00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:03.094
own hearts.'"
These two quotations seem to me

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:08.345
a kind of rubric under which we
can start to think about what it

00:13:08.345 --> 00:13:13.626
means to read this novel,
and what it means to read it in

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:19.139
the light of the religious
context that O'Connor herself,

00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:25.029
critics, marketers,
have built up around her work.

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:30.465
The first quotation from
Sabbath Lily of course focuses

00:13:30.465 --> 00:13:36.182
on the eyes, and it is not hard
to read into Haze Motes's name

00:13:36.182 --> 00:13:41.150
that the trope of sight is going
to be important.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:43.764
"Haze Motes."
There is that famous passage in

00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:47.041
the New Testament (or is it--oh,
gosh--now I'm going to forget

00:13:47.041 --> 00:13:50.800
if it's New or Old Testament;
someone will correct me):

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.778
"Do not try to remove the mote
from your neighbor's eye before

00:13:55.778 --> 00:13:58.879
you have removed it from your
own,"

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:02.830
or "lest you fail to remove the
mote from your own eye."

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.720
So there is this sense of
occluded sight;

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:11.450
"Haze," that haze.
Somehow, something is wrong

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.700
with Haze Motes's eyes,
something wrong with his sight,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:21.681
or rather there is something
important about his sight that

00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:28.048
we're going to have to unpack.
But what I want to take out of

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:35.043
Sabbath Lily's comment about
Haze is this sense of what you

00:14:35.043 --> 00:14:38.786
look at.
What does Haze look at and what

00:14:38.786 --> 00:14:42.093
does he see?
What do we look at when we read

00:14:42.093 --> 00:14:46.207
this novel, and what do we see?
Those are questions that are

00:14:46.207 --> 00:14:49.889
going to frame the two lectures
that I give on this novel.

00:14:49.889 --> 00:14:52.606
The second quotation,
from Onnie Jay Holy,

00:14:52.606 --> 00:14:54.720
raises the question of
sentiment.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.844
This novel--as you will soon
see, once you get to the parts

00:14:58.844 --> 00:15:03.183
where Onnie Jay Holy begins to
preach--this novel is very much

00:15:03.183 --> 00:15:07.566
a critique of sentimentality.
If Richard Wright's ideal

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:11.477
response to his fiction was
that, for the reader,

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:16.692
the words would disappear,
and all they would be left with

00:15:16.692 --> 00:15:21.753
is their emotional response,
for O'Connor it's precisely

00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:26.629
that kind of response--to any
call: be it textual,

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:30.282
be it an act of reading,
an act of audition,

00:15:30.282 --> 00:15:35.123
hearing someone preach--that
kind of response is precisely

00:15:35.123 --> 00:15:39.200
not the one you are
supposed to have.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.869
And so I would ask you to think
about a couple of simple

00:15:42.869 --> 00:15:46.604
questions as you move through
this book, and as you think

00:15:46.604 --> 00:15:49.139
about what I have to say about
it.

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:53.000
One of them could begin with a
reflection like this.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.950
Would you ever want to sit down
to dinner with any of the people

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:56.700
in this novel?

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.389
I see people shaking their
heads.

00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:06.769
They are quite unlikable,
and this is consistent pretty

00:16:06.769 --> 00:16:10.256
much across O'Connor's fiction:
short, long,

00:16:10.256 --> 00:16:15.413
medium, whatever.
Her characters are not very

00:16:15.413 --> 00:16:19.344
endearing.
So you want to ask yourself why

00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:22.391
that's so.
This is a conscious decision on

00:16:22.391 --> 00:16:26.070
her part, and you want to think
about that decision.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.953
If there is any character
who seems kind of endearing,

00:16:29.953 --> 00:16:32.610
at least for me,
it's probably Enoch.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.565
And we'll talk a little bit
more about him:

00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:41.649
not today, but in the second
lecture and in section.

00:16:41.649 --> 00:16:47.115
So, with these questions in
mind, I want you think about how

00:16:47.115 --> 00:16:52.766
we can see the novel and how we
can think about it in the face

00:16:52.766 --> 00:16:58.139
of the interpretation that's
already layered on to it.

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:04.539
And what I want to do is now,
kind of just descend in to the

00:17:04.539 --> 00:17:10.613
text, and read with you the
passage when Haze first takes

00:17:10.613 --> 00:17:15.820
the Essex out for a spin:
his wonderful car,

00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.918
the Essex.
So, this is on page 73,

00:17:19.918 --> 00:17:24.633
is about where it begins,
and I'm going to read through

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:29.174
the next two or three pages.
And I'll skip around in the

00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:33.250
book as things come up that I
want to show you in other parts

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.165
of the book.
So let's think about seeing and

00:17:37.165 --> 00:17:43.329
theology and all the issues that
are already on the table for us.

00:17:43.329 --> 00:17:45.529
I'm going to begin at the
bottom of 73:

00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:48.192
"When the car was
readyÃ¢â¬Â¦."-- If you have

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:50.450
your book, go ahead and open it
up.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:54.537
"When the car was ready,
the man and the boy stood by to

00:17:54.537 --> 00:17:59.070
watch him drive it off."
(Is it the wrong page numbers?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.110
Shoot.
Oh, dear.

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.360
Sixty-nine.
Okay.

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:09.079
So, it's four off.
Thank you for telling me.

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:14.670
You rely on publishers and then
they let you down.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.343
Okay. Does everyone have it?) 
When the car was ready,

00:18:18.343 --> 00:18:22.000
the man and the boy stood by to
watch him drive it off.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.851
He didn't want anybody watching
him because he hadn't driven a

00:18:24.851 --> 00:18:27.530
car in four or five years.
The man and the boy didn't say

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:29.220
anything while he tried to start
it.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.319
They only stood there looking
in at him.

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:37.134
"I wanted this car mostly to be
a house for me," he said to the

00:18:37.134 --> 00:18:40.759
man.
"I ain't got any place to be."

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:43.250
"You ain't took the brake off
yet," the man said.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.132
He took the brake off and the
car shot backwards because the

00:18:46.132 --> 00:18:49.493
man had left it in reverse.
In a second he got it going

00:18:49.493 --> 00:18:53.596
forward and drove off crookedly
past the man and boy still

00:18:53.596 --> 00:18:57.803
standing there watching.
He kept going forward,

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:01.609
thinking nothing and
sweating.

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:03.759
I just want to stop there for a
minute.

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:08.299
Haze sees the car as a kind of
home.

00:19:08.299 --> 00:19:11.619
Well, how are we meant to
understand the meaning of that?

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:18.589
It has the feeling of a rare
moment of explanation from Haze.

00:19:18.589 --> 00:19:23.450
He almost never explains
himself to other people.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:29.009
Here he is accounting for his
need for the car.

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:33.608
Now, of course,
O'Connor was very good at

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:39.816
imbuing her writing with
repeated symbols that grow and

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:47.015
accrue meaning across the text.
So we've already seen the trope

00:19:47.015 --> 00:19:53.027
of the house.
And if you look back at 24 (oh,

00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:58.187
no--try 20;
see if we can find it here.),

00:19:58.187 --> 00:20:04.145
when Haze describes--or,
we sort of know through his

00:20:04.145 --> 00:20:10.220
consciousness--the story of his
time in the Army,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.163
this is what we learn about how
he felt there,

00:20:15.163 --> 00:20:19.803
after he's wounded:
He had all the time he

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:24.647
could want to study his soul in
and assure himself that it was

00:20:24.647 --> 00:20:27.279
not there.
When he was thoroughly

00:20:27.279 --> 00:20:31.859
convinced, he saw that this was
something he had always known.

00:20:31.859 --> 00:20:36.040
The misery he had was a longing
for home.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:41.269
It had nothing to do with Jesus.
When the army finally let him

00:20:41.269 --> 00:20:45.519
go, he was pleased to think that
he was still uncorrupted.

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:49.230
All he wanted was to get back
to Eastrod, Tennessee.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.700
The black Bible and his
mother's glasses were still in

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.710
the bottom of his duffle bag.
He didn't read any book now,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:00.460
but he kept the Bible because
it had come from home.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.108
He kept the glasses in case his
vision should ever become

00:21:04.108 --> 00:21:04.890
dim.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:14.739
O'Connor has already put in
place in the novel through that

00:21:14.739 --> 00:21:20.340
little passage the sense that
the longing for home and the

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.334
longing for redemption--or the
resistance to redemption--these

00:21:26.334 --> 00:21:30.559
things are very close to one
another.

00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:36.444
You can mistake--here we find
out about Haze--you can mistake

00:21:36.444 --> 00:21:41.250
the longing for Jesus for the
longing for home,

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.999
or vice versa:
the longing for home,

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:48.194
for the longing of Jesus.
The Bible that he carries

00:21:48.194 --> 00:21:52.759
around is important to him
because it comes from home.

00:21:52.759 --> 00:21:57.847
I want to suggest to you that
the fact that it's the

00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:01.389
religious book for him,
for his culture,

00:22:01.389 --> 00:22:05.185
for his family,
is not of course incidental to

00:22:05.185 --> 00:22:09.150
the fact that it's what reminds
him of home.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.150
It's not just that you can
mistake the longing for home for

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:18.890
the longing for Jesus.
You can in some ways see

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:24.970
religion and home as conflated.
And this gets to a traditional

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.925
Christian notion of the believer
as not being at home in the

00:22:29.925 --> 00:22:35.049
world: that the believer somehow
belongs to God's kingdom,

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:40.304
and that this is either
countercultural--at odds with

00:22:40.304 --> 00:22:46.770
the general world in which he or
she would find herself--or it is

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:52.529
totally incompatible with the
world in which we live.

00:22:52.529 --> 00:22:57.707
The Bible is a physical
manifestation of the proximity

00:22:57.707 --> 00:23:02.250
of the spiritual and the
material in this world.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:06.512
So what makes him feel close to
home, in a way,

00:23:06.512 --> 00:23:11.700
has to make him feel close to
the religion he's trying to

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.215
reject.
That conflation is part of what

00:23:15.215 --> 00:23:19.482
makes it impossible for Haze to
escape the question of

00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:22.472
redemption,
even if he wants to answer it

00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:25.490
in a way that's at odds with
how, for example,

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.007
his grandfather,
the preacher,

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:31.148
would answer it.
This is why he's continually

00:23:31.148 --> 00:23:33.910
mistaken for a preacher,
no matter what he does.

00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.132
Remember he goes in to the
prostitute's house,

00:23:36.132 --> 00:23:37.861
Mrs.
Watts's, and he's got a hat on,

00:23:37.861 --> 00:23:40.430
and the hat just makes him look
like a preacher.

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.463
There's nothing he can do.
He says, "I'm not a preacher,"

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.655
and she says,
"That's okay if you're not a

00:23:45.655 --> 00:23:50.521
preacher."
It's just something that's in

00:23:50.521 --> 00:23:54.130
his body;
it's physical.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:58.764
So the car--going back to
the passage that I was talking

00:23:58.764 --> 00:24:03.790
about before with the Essex--the
car (even though religion is not

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.329
mentioned directly right here),
the sense of home that it

00:24:08.329 --> 00:24:12.480
embodies, carries with it all
that sense of unhousedness.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.837
And, because it's a moving
house, it carries the sense of

00:24:17.837 --> 00:24:21.759
the wandering believer with it
as well.

00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:27.177
And you get that reinforced on
the very next page (if you just

00:24:27.177 --> 00:24:32.151
skip over about a page from
there): "A black pickup truck

00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:35.970
turned off a side road in front
of him.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:39.151
On the back of it,
an iron bed and a chair and

00:24:39.151 --> 00:24:42.332
table were tied,
and on top of them a crate of

00:24:42.332 --> 00:24:46.083
Barred Rock chickens."
So other cars on the road

00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:48.608
looked like houses,
mobile houses,

00:24:48.608 --> 00:24:52.043
as well.
It's not just Haze's Essex that

00:24:52.043 --> 00:24:55.378
is imagined as home.
So O'Connor is giving us a

00:24:55.378 --> 00:24:58.009
version of the road,
and I want you to keep this in

00:24:58.009 --> 00:25:00.693
mind because of course we're
going to read On the

00:25:00.693 --> 00:25:03.342
Road,
 and we are going to see

00:25:03.342 --> 00:25:06.920
a major road trip in Lolita,
actually two of them.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:10.592
So the iconography of the
American road is something that

00:25:10.592 --> 00:25:15.170
is going to come back to us.
Well, here is our first example.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:20.225
This is the road of the
unhoused, of the spiritually

00:25:20.225 --> 00:25:24.289
seeking, of the wandering,
of the lost.

00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:28.710
People wander in search of some
kind of coherent meaning.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:38.623
I want to now move down a
little bit and observe how

00:25:38.623 --> 00:25:43.795
landscape is presented to us.
This is after that,

00:25:43.795 --> 00:25:45.900
"since he was going very
fastÃ¢â¬Â¦":

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.155
The highway was ragged
with filling stations and

00:25:49.155 --> 00:25:51.833
trailer camps and roadhouses.
After a while,

00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:55.094
there were stretches where red
gullies dropped off on either

00:25:55.094 --> 00:25:58.040
side of the road,
and behind them there were

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.650
patches of field buttoned
together with 666 posts.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.799
The sky leaked all over all of
it, and then it began to leak in

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:08.227
to the car.
The head of a string of pigs

00:26:08.227 --> 00:26:10.118
appeared, snout-up,
over the ditch,

00:26:10.118 --> 00:26:13.512
and he had to screech to a stop
and watch the rear of the last

00:26:13.512 --> 00:26:16.849
pig disappear shaking into the
ditch on the other side.

00:26:16.849 --> 00:26:19.589
He started the car again and
went on.

00:26:19.589 --> 00:26:23.702
He had the feeling that
everything he saw was a

00:26:23.702 --> 00:26:29.245
broken-off piece of some giant
blank thing he had forgotten had

00:26:29.245 --> 00:26:33.238
happened to him.
So what do we notice about this

00:26:33.238 --> 00:26:35.095
landscape?
First of all,

00:26:35.095 --> 00:26:39.788
it's very much constructed.
It's buttoned together with

00:26:39.788 --> 00:26:44.234
posts, as if someone had built
it, and--what's more--these are

00:26:44.234 --> 00:26:48.823
described as 666 posts.
I think this is probably a size

00:26:48.823 --> 00:26:53.951
of lumber, but you can't get
away from the mythology of that

00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:56.543
number.
In the Book of Revelation it's

00:26:56.543 --> 00:27:00.000
the number of the beast;
it's the number of the devil.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.822
It's also a landscape that is
full of pigs,

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:07.917
wandering pigs,
so if the people are wandering

00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:12.325
through this road,
the pigs are equally wanderers

00:27:12.325 --> 00:27:15.630
throughout these fields.
They're unconfined;

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:20.849
they seem to cross the road at
will.

00:27:20.849 --> 00:27:27.153
The sky, the world above,
is really bound up with the

00:27:27.153 --> 00:27:30.270
world below.
There is very little

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.603
separation, even if there is a
sense that the sky is impinging

00:27:34.603 --> 00:27:37.800
on the earth and not the other
way around.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.490
"The sky leaked over all of it."
It's really,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.819
in a sense, the physical image
is of rain;

00:27:44.819 --> 00:27:47.030
it's raining,
so it's leaking all over it.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:50.415
But there's more than that.
There is this sense of the

00:27:50.415 --> 00:27:54.259
concerns of the sky somehow,
the concerns of the above;

00:27:54.259 --> 00:27:58.790
the concerns of the
transcendent are seeping their

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:03.690
way in to the concerns of the
material world below.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.426
And then you get that sort of
lyrical moment of

00:28:07.426 --> 00:28:10.595
interpretation:
"He had the feeling that

00:28:10.595 --> 00:28:14.900
everything he saw was a
broken-off piece of some giant

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.450
blank thing he had forgotten had
happened to him."

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:23.220
Now this is where the
omniscient narrator comes in

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.836
quite forcefully,
and gives us something to work

00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:30.991
on as we analyze Haze and we
think about who he is as a

00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:34.299
character and where he finds
himself.

00:28:34.299 --> 00:28:38.064
This connects I think with
a whole host of other passages

00:28:38.064 --> 00:28:40.259
that have to do with
nothingness.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:43.234
And one of them is right above
on that page,

00:28:43.234 --> 00:28:46.831
and I read it a little earlier:
"thinking nothing and

00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:50.460
sweating."
It's as if "thinking nothing"

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.680
is not a passive activity,
but an active one.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.579
So that, to think nothing is
something you have to work at;

00:28:58.579 --> 00:29:02.230
it's something that you can be
preoccupied with.

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:07.797
And similarly,
if you look back at 37--this is

00:29:07.797 --> 00:29:13.859
again a description of
landscape--you can see this

00:29:13.859 --> 00:29:18.605
connection between (or,
well, somewhat of a

00:29:18.605 --> 00:29:22.009
disconnection between) the above
and the below,

00:29:22.009 --> 00:29:26.820
another description of sky.
This is Hazel walking in

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:32.650
Taulkinham: "The black sky was
underpinned with long,

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.490
silver streaks" (this is the
very beginning of Chapter 3 if

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.764
you're trying to find it):
Ã¢â¬Â¦that looked like

00:29:38.764 --> 00:29:42.288
scaffolding and depth on depth
behind it were thousands of

00:29:42.288 --> 00:29:45.380
stars that all seemed to be
moving very slowly,

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:49.795
as if they were about some vast
construction work that involved

00:29:49.795 --> 00:29:53.854
the whole order of the universe
and would take all time to

00:29:53.854 --> 00:29:58.316
complete.
No one was paying any attention

00:29:58.316 --> 00:30:03.085
to the sky.
Here that omniscient narrator,

00:30:03.085 --> 00:30:07.339
as when that narrator looks in
to Haze's mind,

00:30:07.339 --> 00:30:11.672
offers you a reading of the sky
and its separation from the

00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:14.660
minds of the characters that
suggests,

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:19.069
or makes you look for,
kinds of structure.

00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:22.440
Here, it's the construction
work;

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.940
she actually uses that word.
But you get scaffolding;

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:29.984
you get depth or perspective:
counting thousands of stars,

00:30:29.984 --> 00:30:33.886
"movingÃ¢â¬Â¦as if they were
about some vast work that

00:30:33.886 --> 00:30:37.150
involved the whole order of the
universe."

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:41.289
It vaults the very concrete
materiality, the physicality,

00:30:41.289 --> 00:30:44.690
of these characters and their
circumstances.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.862
It vaults that discussion into
a much larger,

00:30:47.862 --> 00:30:50.314
metaphysical,
transcendent context,

00:30:50.314 --> 00:30:52.910
the whole order of the
universe.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:57.220
It's moments like these
when that omniscient narrator

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.146
lives up to its name,
that sense of omniscience that

00:31:01.146 --> 00:31:07.336
we might associate with God.
Another example is at the very

00:31:07.336 --> 00:31:11.420
opening of the book:
The train was racing

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.642
through treetops that fell away
at intervals and showed the sun

00:31:14.642 --> 00:31:17.500
standing very red on the edge of
the farthest woods.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.484
Near the plowed fields curved
and faded, and the few hogs

00:31:21.484 --> 00:31:25.539
nosing in the furrows looked
like large spotted stones.

00:31:25.539 --> 00:31:26.150
Mrs.
Wally B.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.493
Hitchcock, who was facing Motes
in the section,

00:31:28.493 --> 00:31:31.344
said that she thought the early
evening like this was the

00:31:31.344 --> 00:31:34.690
prettiest time of day,
and she asked him if he didn't

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.530
think so too.
"Pretty" is not exactly the

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:40.708
word that comes to mind--at
least not to my mind--when I

00:31:40.708 --> 00:31:43.735
read this.
It's more like "heavy" or

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:48.470
"saturated," and there's again
pigs running around.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:52.720
Again there is a biblical
iconography behind this.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:57.230
There are two instances that
come to my mind.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:02.658
When demons are cast out by the
apostles and sent into a herd of

00:32:02.658 --> 00:32:07.140
pigs, and the pigs go running
off a cliff and die;

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:11.093
that's one image.
Another is the admonition not

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:16.314
to throw your pearls before
swine, not to preach to those

00:32:16.314 --> 00:32:20.230
who can't hear,
or won't be perceptive.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:25.324
So these moments of
landscape description offer up

00:32:25.324 --> 00:32:29.745
that consistently
Christian-inflected theory of

00:32:29.745 --> 00:32:33.547
the universe,
that sense of transcendence as

00:32:33.547 --> 00:32:37.160
structure, as something that's
moving inexorably,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:39.000
that will take all time to
complete.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.910
It has a project;
it has a teleology.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.438
So, that's present in all of
these moments,

00:32:45.438 --> 00:32:50.143
but--equally present--I want to
get back to this sense of

00:32:50.143 --> 00:32:53.691
blankness.
There is a vagueness to this

00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:58.690
language that I think is quite
calculated, and it relates,

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:04.628
in Haze's case,
to his determination to not be

00:33:04.628 --> 00:33:09.380
converted to evil,
but to nothing.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.636
When he's in the army,
he says--he decides--he can get

00:33:14.636 --> 00:33:19.991
rid of Jesus by converting not
to evil, but to nothing,

00:33:19.991 --> 00:33:24.411
to believe in nothing.
So what O'Connor does,

00:33:24.411 --> 00:33:29.519
is she presents a sense of the
world imbued with structure and

00:33:29.519 --> 00:33:32.903
meaning,
but a structure and meaning

00:33:32.903 --> 00:33:37.007
that looks essentially blank.
And I think the task of the

00:33:37.007 --> 00:33:38.830
novel is to fill that structure
in.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.319
The last thing I want to
point out, in this passage from

00:33:47.319 --> 00:33:51.742
here to the end of the chapter,
is the way that Haze's senses

00:33:51.742 --> 00:33:55.034
are described.
We already talked a little bit

00:33:55.034 --> 00:33:57.849
about his name and the occlusion
of sight.

00:33:57.849 --> 00:34:00.810
The trope of sight is obviously
extremely important here.

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.915
We have the blind preacher.
There are more things,

00:34:03.915 --> 00:34:06.678
which I won't reveal,
that happen at the end of the

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:09.617
novel to do with this.
If you haven't read,

00:34:09.617 --> 00:34:13.675
I won't give it away.
But here, there are simpler

00:34:13.675 --> 00:34:18.888
examples: when the truck pulls
up in front of Haze and starts

00:34:18.888 --> 00:34:23.241
moving very slowly,
"Haze started pounding his

00:34:23.241 --> 00:34:28.498
horn, and he had hit it three
times before he realized it

00:34:28.498 --> 00:34:32.900
didn't make any sound."
He keeps doing this.

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.097
When he comes to the roadside
sign, "Woe to the blasphemer and

00:34:37.097 --> 00:34:41.599
whore monger.
Will hell swallow you up?"

00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:44.096
it says "The pickup truck
slowed even more,

00:34:44.096 --> 00:34:47.485
as if it were reading the sign,
and Haze pounded his empty

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:50.967
horn.
He beat on it and beat on it

00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:57.624
but it didn't make any sound."
He doesn't at first hear the

00:34:57.624 --> 00:35:01.625
horn fail to blow,
and then later,

00:35:01.625 --> 00:35:08.414
when a truck pulls up behind
him, he fails to hear a horn

00:35:08.414 --> 00:35:12.170
that does blow:
He was looking at the

00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:13.739
sign, and he didn't hear the
horn.

00:35:13.739 --> 00:35:17.039
An oil truck as long as a
railroad car was behind him.

00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:20.016
In a second,
a red, square face was at his

00:35:20.016 --> 00:35:23.476
car window.
It watched the back of his neck

00:35:23.476 --> 00:35:27.697
and hat for a minute,
and then a hand came in and sat

00:35:27.697 --> 00:35:30.758
on his shoulder.
The driver's expression and his

00:35:30.758 --> 00:35:33.844
hand stayed exactly the way they
were, as if he didn't hear very

00:35:33.844 --> 00:35:37.498
well.
These two characters are as if

00:35:37.498 --> 00:35:42.050
there is a wall between them,
a wall of foam.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.340
They can't hear each other.
They're insulated from

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.320
understanding what the other is
preoccupied with.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.951
In Haze's case,
he does this over and over and

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:59.129
over again.
And the most pitiful example of

00:35:59.129 --> 00:36:02.329
it is on 57.
Poor Enoch!

00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:07.210
I feel so bad for him in this
passage.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.679
Enoch is trying to hang out
with Haze.

00:36:11.679 --> 00:36:15.090
This is on the bottom of 56,
probably your 52.

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:21.900
Haze is trying to get rid of
Enoch:

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.613
"Listen," Haze said
roughly, "I got business of my

00:36:23.613 --> 00:36:25.680
own.
I seen all of you I want."

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.217
He began walking very fast.
Enoch kept skipping steps to

00:36:29.217 --> 00:36:31.085
keep up.
"I been here two months," he

00:36:31.085 --> 00:36:33.849
said, "and I don't know nobody.
People ain't friendly here.

00:36:33.849 --> 00:36:36.620
I got me a room and there ain't
never nobody in it but me.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.763
My daddy said I had to come.
I would never have come but he

00:36:39.763 --> 00:36:41.645
made me.
I think I seen you somewheres

00:36:41.645 --> 00:36:43.108
before.
You ain't from Stockwell,

00:36:43.108 --> 00:36:43.960
are you?"
"No."

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.800
"Melsey?"
"No."

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.289
"Sawmill set there- set up
there once," Enoch said.

00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:52.860
"Looked like you had kind of a
familiar face."

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.376
They walked on without saying
anything until they got to the

00:36:55.376 --> 00:36:57.280
main street again.
It was almost deserted.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.355
"Goodbye," Haze said.
"I'm going thisaway too," Enoch

00:37:00.355 --> 00:37:03.569
said in a sullen voice.
On the left there was a movie

00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:06.559
house where the electric bill
was being changed.

00:37:06.559 --> 00:37:07.757
"[And then I'm going to skip
down.]

00:37:07.757 --> 00:37:09.659
"My daddy made me come," he
said in a cracked voice.

00:37:09.659 --> 00:37:13.719
Haze looked at him and saw he
was crying, his face seamed and

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:17.495
wet and a purple-pink color.
"I ain't but 18 years old," he

00:37:17.495 --> 00:37:20.579
cried, "and he made me come and
I don't know nobody.

00:37:20.579 --> 00:37:22.920
Nobody here'll have nothin' to
do with nobody else.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.301
They ain't friendly.
He done gone off with a woman

00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:28.020
and made me come but she ain't
going to stay for long."

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:32.040
Okay, and so on and so on.
Poor Enoch!

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.690
Does Haze care?
No;

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.568
not at all.
"Haze looked straight ahead,

00:37:36.568 --> 00:37:40.840
with his face set."
Poor Enoch.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.721
Nothing can penetrate Haze's
imperviousness to other human

00:37:46.721 --> 00:37:50.353
beings.
If Haze is busy looking at

00:37:50.353 --> 00:37:56.486
something, what he's looking at
is manifestly not the

00:37:56.486 --> 00:38:02.771
person in front of him.
He can't hear major elements of

00:38:02.771 --> 00:38:07.739
the soundscape:
the truck horn behind him.

00:38:07.739 --> 00:38:11.300
He can't hear his own horn,
whether it blows or not.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.450
He can't hear the voices of
other people.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:19.358
What he sees is a mystery.
As Sabbath Lily says,

00:38:19.358 --> 00:38:24.260
"his eyes, they don't look like
they see what he's looking at."

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.633
What is he looking at, then?
I think we're meant to

00:38:28.633 --> 00:38:34.854
understand that he is so focused
on the question of redemption

00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:38.730
that he fails to see anything
else;

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:43.689
he fails to see anyone else in
his preoccupation with that

00:38:43.689 --> 00:38:47.288
problem.
Now I want to switch gears,

00:38:47.288 --> 00:38:51.248
just for the last couple
minutes, and ask you:

00:38:51.248 --> 00:38:55.119
what do you see when you read
this novel?

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:59.790
And I'm going to suggest to you
something to think about.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.664
I see body parts.
When I read this novel,

00:39:03.664 --> 00:39:07.520
I see a lot of dismembered body
parts.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.590
What do I mean by that?
Well, let's take a look.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:18.456
On page 32(try 28;
see if you can find it),

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:23.601
this is Haze coming to the
house of Leora Watts:

00:39:23.601 --> 00:39:30.278
"He went up to the front porch
and put his eye to a convenient

00:39:30.278 --> 00:39:36.517
crack in the shade and found
himself looking directly at a

00:39:36.517 --> 00:39:41.410
large,
white knee."

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.260
And what's she doing?
She's cutting her toenails.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.066
"Mrs.
Watts was sitting alone in a

00:39:46.066 --> 00:39:49.078
white iron bed cutting her
toenails with a large pair of

00:39:49.078 --> 00:39:51.583
scissors.
She was a big woman with very

00:39:51.583 --> 00:39:54.922
yellow hair and white skin that
glistened with a greasy

00:39:54.922 --> 00:39:57.318
preparation.
She had on a pink nightgown

00:39:57.318 --> 00:39:59.820
that would have better fit a
smaller figure."

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:03.607
That large,
white knee: the way this

00:40:03.607 --> 00:40:08.948
narration allows us to see
through Haze's eyes begins to

00:40:08.948 --> 00:40:14.094
take the whole body apart,
so what he sees is not Mrs.

00:40:14.094 --> 00:40:17.179
Watts;
he sees a large, white knee.

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:22.876
We saw a version of this also
in the passage I was reading

00:40:22.876 --> 00:40:27.872
just before, where "a hand"
comes in the window and

00:40:27.872 --> 00:40:31.770
rests--"lands"--on Haze's
shoulder.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.639
"A square, red face."
And then these things,

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:38.147
these body parts,
are then referred to with the

00:40:38.147 --> 00:40:40.492
pronoun "it";
"it," the hand,

00:40:40.492 --> 00:40:47.400
did this or that.
Take a look at page 18.

00:40:53.619 --> 00:40:59.900
This is Mrs.
Hitchcock in the train;

00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:01.539
it's Haze bumping into Mrs.
Hitchcock:

00:41:01.539 --> 00:41:05.263
Going around the corner,
he ran in to something heavy

00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:08.074
and pink.
It gasped and muttered,

00:41:08.074 --> 00:41:09.626
"Clumsy."
It was Mrs.

00:41:09.626 --> 00:41:12.865
Hitchcock in a pink wrapper
with her hair in knots around

00:41:12.865 --> 00:41:15.343
her head.
She looked at him with her eyes

00:41:15.343 --> 00:41:18.786
squinted nearly shut.
The knobs framed her face like

00:41:18.786 --> 00:41:21.162
dark toadstools.
She tried to get past him,

00:41:21.162 --> 00:41:23.492
and he tried to let her,
but they were both moving the

00:41:23.492 --> 00:41:26.654
same way each time.
Her face became purplish except

00:41:26.654 --> 00:41:30.830
for little, white marks over it
that didn't heat up.

00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:34.494
It's that she's rotting;
there is mushrooms growing on

00:41:34.494 --> 00:41:37.889
her, figurative mushrooms
growing on her head.

00:41:37.889 --> 00:41:40.980
Her face is purple except for
the white marks.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:46.090
The white marks are little
scars, acne scars perhaps.

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:50.834
She is a sort of mass of flesh.
As Mrs.

00:41:50.834 --> 00:41:54.763
Watts, that pink
wrapper--actually two pink

00:41:54.763 --> 00:42:00.095
wrappers, too tight on their
bodies--suggest the excess of

00:42:00.095 --> 00:42:04.960
their corporeality,
they"re big hunks of flesh.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:15.630
On 62, we get an account of
Haze's childhood sin.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:23.118
He goes into the freak show at
the fair, and he joins the crowd

00:42:23.118 --> 00:42:28.209
where his father also is.
"They were looking down into a

00:42:28.209 --> 00:42:30.588
lowered place,
where something white was

00:42:30.588 --> 00:42:33.699
lying, squirming a little,
in a box lined with black

00:42:33.699 --> 00:42:35.995
cloth.
For a second he thought it was

00:42:35.995 --> 00:42:38.218
a skinned animal,
and then he saw it was a

00:42:38.218 --> 00:42:38.760
woman."

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:47.130
On 15 (I'm going to skip back
to the train;

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:50.815
I'm just going to rack these up
for you, and then we'll think

00:42:50.815 --> 00:42:54.008
about them), this is Haze
waiting to be seated in the

00:42:54.008 --> 00:42:57.690
dining car of the train:
Haze hesitated and saw

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:00.880
the hand jerk again [the hand of
the steward].

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.118
He lurched up the aisle,
falling against two tables on

00:43:04.118 --> 00:43:07.539
the way and getting his hand wet
in somebody's coffee.

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:11.185
The steward placed him with
three youngish women dressed

00:43:11.185 --> 00:43:14.625
like parrots.
Their hands were resting on the

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:18.679
table, red speared at the tips.
He sat and looked in front of

00:43:18.679 --> 00:43:21.579
him--[I'm skipping down a little
bit], glum and intense,

00:43:21.579 --> 00:43:23.900
at the neck of the woman across
from him.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.147
At intervals her hand holding
the cigarette would pass the

00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:30.170
spot on her neck.
It would go out of his sight,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.516
and then it would pass again
going back down to the

00:43:33.516 --> 00:43:37.250
table.
What do we make of these odd

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.150
moments of description?
Why all these body parts

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.679
hanging around?
Why this sense of disgusting,

00:43:46.679 --> 00:43:53.170
excessive body matter?
It's often women who appear in

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.980
this guise, but it's not always
women.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:02.775
What I want to suggest to you
is that, when we actually look

00:44:02.775 --> 00:44:08.700
at the sentences on the page,
when we look at the words that

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:13.309
O'Connor chose in the moments of
the narration,

00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:18.348
we see something that becomes
more complicated than the

00:44:18.348 --> 00:44:22.360
"Flannery O'Connor is a Catholic
writer";

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.957
"Haze Motes is a Christian
malgrÃ©

00:44:25.957 --> 00:44:30.329
lui."
That's a kind of focus.

00:44:30.329 --> 00:44:34.813
If we think about this,
analogize it to how Haze looks,

00:44:34.813 --> 00:44:39.131
it's a way of looking at
O'Connor's fiction that sees

00:44:39.131 --> 00:44:42.369
nothing but the theology behind
it,

00:44:42.369 --> 00:44:46.889
that sees nothing but the
Christian iconography.

00:44:46.889 --> 00:44:50.891
And I want to ask:
what is it that we don't see,

00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:55.440
when that's all we see?
What do we miss?

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.696
I've begun to point out a
few things that I think we miss:

00:44:59.696 --> 00:45:03.471
the fragmentation of bodies.
Why are bodies consistently

00:45:03.471 --> 00:45:06.585
fragmented--not just
here--everywhere in O'Connor's

00:45:06.585 --> 00:45:09.073
fiction?
People are always losing a

00:45:09.073 --> 00:45:12.750
wooden leg and having parts of
their limbs fall off.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:16.080
It's very hard to keep a body
together in O'Connor,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.611
hard to keep body and
soulÃ¢â¬Â¦well,

00:45:18.611 --> 00:45:24.650
I won't get in to that.
So why is that?

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:28.169
What kind of methodology for
reading would allow us to have

00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:31.252
something to say about that?
Is it something we need to have

00:45:31.252 --> 00:45:34.917
something to say about?
Is it in the same register of

00:45:34.917 --> 00:45:40.570
importance in our reading as
some of these more theological,

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:44.567
structural considerations that
have been offered to us in her

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:48.852
letters, in her preface,
and in the very overt symbology

00:45:48.852 --> 00:45:53.134
of the landscape scenes,
of these other scenes that I

00:45:53.134 --> 00:45:58.391
was reading to you today,
in that image of the unhoused

00:45:58.391 --> 00:46:03.480
believer trying to find a home
in an alien world?

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:07.825
So, in my next lecture,
what I'm going to do is pretty

00:46:07.825 --> 00:46:11.179
much contradict most of what I
said today.

00:46:11.179 --> 00:46:18.050
I'm going to set aside theology
as the lens through which I

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.828
read.
And, if you felt you were

00:46:20.828 --> 00:46:25.581
convinced by my reading of that
iconography in these passages,

00:46:25.581 --> 00:46:29.789
then you want to think about
why that's convincing.

00:46:29.789 --> 00:46:33.949
You want to think about how
much attention and primacy we

00:46:33.949 --> 00:46:38.110
should give to an author's
statements about what her work

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.557
mean--as readers.
Maybe you want to say,

00:46:41.557 --> 00:46:46.030
"You can't argue with that;
we have to accept that.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.662
That's really what the writer
intends to say,

00:46:48.662 --> 00:46:51.954
and that's what we should see,
and that's what we should

00:46:51.954 --> 00:46:55.152
strive to understand."
Well, I'm going to offer you

00:46:55.152 --> 00:46:58.260
two different ways--actually
more like three different

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.309
ways--to look at the novel in
the second lecture.

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:06.320
So, finish the novel for next
Wednesday, and we will go from

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.320
there.

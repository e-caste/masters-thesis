00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.640
Prof: We're coming to
the end of the course,

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.956
and the last couple of
lectures, the last few are

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:13.812
social issues and then we'll
have a very short time for

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:16.600
environment, unfortunately.
 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.720
Today we're going to talk about
abortion.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.075
It's kind of a unique topic in
the sense that in the United

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:27.090
States it's--
if you have a global

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.494
perspective, in most of the
world abortion is not a big

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:33.370
controversial issue.
 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.123
In the United States it's just
gone sky high as kind of the

00:00:38.123 --> 00:00:42.140
central issue in the American
debate on values.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.140
It has tremendous political
significance.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.805
Large numbers of people vote
for a candidate for,

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:52.887
say president,
based solely on whether they

00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:55.900
are pro-choice or pro-life.
 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.519
One of the things you've got to
figure out, or try to,

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.728
is why has this become so
important an issue.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:06.290
I think one of the reasons is
that it encapsulates

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.650
diametrically opposed views of
our roles in everyday life.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.870
People perceive it as an
everyday kind of issue.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.360
What are the roles that I'm
talking about?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.470
Sex roles, work roles,
husband and wife roles,

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.819
motherhood and fatherhood
roles;

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.513
all of those--how you perceive
yourself in those roles will

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:33.450
very much determine how you feel
about the abortion debate.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.795
For instance,
both sides in the debate agree

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:41.129
that the issue is about murder.
 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:44.739
A pro-lifer sees images of a
three month old fetus,

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.437
which even though only about
the size of your finger they

00:01:48.437 --> 00:01:50.860
see--
they're having visuals of blown

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.590
up photographs and I'm sure
you've all seen those things and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.930
it already looks quite baby
like,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.328
and thinks of it of being
dismembered and murdered.

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:04.819
A pro-choicer also sees it
about murder,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.560
but she, in her mind,
sees a young woman,

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.639
maybe herself,
in a back alley abortion,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.389
being butchered and possibly
murdered.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:19.790
Almost everyone of the older
generation of pro-choice women

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.610
has either themselves had an
abortion,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.370
or has had a friend who has had
an abortion,

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.330
and they perceived it as
lifesaving,

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.449
or if it was a back alley,
unsuccessful one,

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:37.288
as a life depriving situation.
 

00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:41.340
Both sides agree that the issue
is about babies and motherhood.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.328
A pro-life mother thinks that
babies are so precious that

00:02:45.328 --> 00:02:48.960
whenever they come they will be
loved and wanted.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.788
There is no such thing as an
unloved or unwanted baby.

00:02:52.788 --> 00:02:56.973
A pro-choice mother thinks that
babies are so precious that they

00:02:56.973 --> 00:03:00.826
should only be had when the
woman really wants the baby and

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.479
is in the situation in life
where they have resources to

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.340
take care of the baby.
 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.860
Both sides agree that the issue
is about sex.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.074
A pro-life woman thinks that
sex is so special that it should

00:03:14.074 --> 00:03:18.288
be guarded by strong religious
and social controls so that it

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:21.240
always has an almost sacred
character.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.014
A pro-choice woman thinks sex
is so special that it should be

00:03:25.014 --> 00:03:28.852
freed from worry about pregnancy
and disease so that it can be

00:03:28.852 --> 00:03:31.620
enjoyed as a unique sharing of
intimacy.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.538
Both sides agree that the issue
is about the status of women.

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:39.167
Pro-life women think that women
are so important that their

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:42.419
special life role of motherhood
must be protected.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:46.438
Pro-choice women think that
women are so important that they

00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:50.593
should have every bit as much
control over their life roles as

00:03:50.593 --> 00:03:51.479
men have.
 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:56.166
Just viewed in that way,
one of the interesting things

00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:01.030
about this abortion debate is
that the two sides on--

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.986
if you really get down to what
the fundamental values of the

00:04:03.986 --> 00:04:06.259
two sides are,
they're not different.

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.038
They apply them differently.
 

00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:12.245
They're thinking of different
instances, of different real

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:16.230
situations in which to apply
these rather same kinds of

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.370
fundamental human values.
 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.324
All right, well obviously this
is not a philosophy course and

00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:24.129
not in the slightest set up to
debate the pros and cons of

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.026
abortion,
and that's also a kind of

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:28.439
sterile debate.
 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:32.574
Anybody--has anybody changed
their mind about abortion since

00:04:32.574 --> 00:04:36.290
they were knee high to a
grasshopper, in the class?

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.100
I don't want to know which
direction you went.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.879
One has changed her mind,
two have changed their mind.

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.790
That's a high ratio.
 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.307
Does anybody know anybody who's
changed their minds,

00:04:47.307 --> 00:04:51.170
except for yourself of course,
one or two more people;

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.509
three another one.
 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.793
I mean there's so much about
abortion out there and yet

00:04:57.793 --> 00:05:03.370
people's attitude toward it is
set very early in life,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.036
by again, these very
fundamental images of what we're

00:05:06.036 --> 00:05:08.600
talking about when we're talking
about abortion.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.786
No matter how it's argued,
people basically don't change

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:15.389
their opinions.
 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.769
I'm not going to debate pros
and cons at all.

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:23.709
I'm going to give you as many
facts about abortion as I can

00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:26.019
explain to you:
the demography,

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:27.860
and the biology,
and the statistics,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.199
and all of that kind of stuff.
 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:34.795
There are a number of important
things that you should know

00:05:34.795 --> 00:05:35.850
about abortion.
 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.389
The first is that induced
abortion is common;

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.230
it's a very frequent situation
in the world.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:49.394
There's one abortion for every
3.2 live births,

00:05:49.394 --> 00:05:51.940
so that's 1 in 3.
 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.095
Each year about 3% of women in
childbearing ages have an

00:05:57.095 --> 00:06:00.541
abortion,
and if you consider a 30 year

00:06:00.541 --> 00:06:05.348
reproductive lifespan with each
woman having a 3% chance each

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:06.870
year that's 90%.
 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.524
That means that,
in the world,

00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:14.649
the average woman has a 0.9
chance, very close to one.

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:20.577
Basically, for every woman in
the world, there's one abortion

00:06:20.577 --> 00:06:23.639
in her reproductive lifetime.
 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.267
Of course this is an average,
some women have many more,

00:06:28.267 --> 00:06:30.540
and some women have none.
 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.595
There are three,
actually three or four standard

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:39.860
ways of measuring and expressing
the frequency of abortion.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.088
One is simply the number of
abortions in the world,

00:06:43.088 --> 00:06:45.800
or in the country,
or whatever you want.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.172
The latest estimate,
all of these latest estimates

00:06:50.172 --> 00:06:51.690
come from 2003.
 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.297
About every five years people
try to tally up abortion

00:06:56.297 --> 00:07:01.774
statistics from around the world
and that's a very difficult job

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:06.439
because wherever its illegal,
you have very great difficulty

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:07.579
getting statistics.
 

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:12.012
In many places--especially
where there's religious

00:07:12.012 --> 00:07:17.077
opposition to abortion they--the
statistics include it as

00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:19.519
'menstrual regulation.'
 

00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:23.490
That means a woman has missed
her menses and,

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.910
of course, everyone knows
that's a good thing,

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.858
so you have to restore the
menses and you do exactly what's

00:07:28.858 --> 00:07:29.569
an abortion.
 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:33.029
Everybody in the country will
understand what's going on,

00:07:33.029 --> 00:07:35.750
but the statistic is menstrual
regulation.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.379
Depending on what's happening
in the country,

00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:41.166
you usually have to add one
part of the government

00:07:41.166 --> 00:07:44.466
statistics about menstrual
regulation to another part which

00:07:44.466 --> 00:07:45.490
says abortion.
 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.218
Anyway, there are lots of
problems in collecting these

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:53.230
numbers but they're probably
fairly decent because they're

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:56.218
very sophisticated--
demographically very

00:07:56.218 --> 00:08:00.115
sophisticated people are the
ones that try to make these best

00:08:00.115 --> 00:08:00.959
estimates.
 

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:05.543
The number of abortions in the
world is now considered to be 42

00:08:05.543 --> 00:08:09.980
million per year and the number
has stayed in that range,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:12.745
the 40 to 50 million range,
for at least the last two

00:08:12.745 --> 00:08:14.863
decades,
when there's fairly good

00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:16.779
collection of the statistics.
 

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:17.939
So that's the number.
 

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:22.882
The abortion rate is defined as
the abortions per 1,000 women in

00:08:22.882 --> 00:08:26.964
reproductive ages which is
usually taken as 15 to 44,

00:08:26.964 --> 00:08:28.220
or 15 to 49.
 

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.410
For the world it's 29 per 1,000.
 

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.375
So, every year,
per 1,000 women,

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.480
29 have an abortion.
 

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.058
That's the 3% that I mentioned
earlier;

00:08:39.058 --> 00:08:41.379
if it was 30 it would be
exactly 3%.

00:08:41.379 --> 00:08:45.750
Both the highest rate and the
lowest rates are found in

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.480
Europe.
 

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.690
Western Europe has 12 abortions
per 1,000 women per year;

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:58.136
Eastern Europe has four times
as many, 44 per 1,000 women per

00:08:58.136 --> 00:08:58.889
year.
 

00:08:58.889 --> 00:09:02.500
It's interesting that of the
whole world,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.407
within Europe,
which we sometimes consider a

00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:06.951
cultural entity,
it isn't with respect to

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:11.350
abortion, the highest and lowest
numbers are found in Europe.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.852
Another way of expressing it is
the abortion ratio which is the

00:09:15.852 --> 00:09:19.921
abortions per 100 live births,
and that's what I told you

00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:20.720
before.
 

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.928
One abortion for every 3.2 live
births.

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:26.980
In the world,
that comes out to 31 per 100

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.330
and this ranges from 12 in
middle Africa,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.440
it's a low rate,
to 105 in Eastern Europe,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.000
again Eastern Europe has the
highest in the world.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.008
Note that 105;
we're talking about abortions

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:42.740
per live births.
 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.570
When you have 105 abortions per
100 live births,

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.220
there are more abortions than
live births.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.860
So, at 100 per 100,
half of pregnancies are

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.889
terminated with an abortion.
 

00:09:57.889 --> 00:10:00.895
Interestingly,
the abortion rate is the same,

00:10:00.895 --> 00:10:04.585
is very closely the same,
independent of whether you're

00:10:04.585 --> 00:10:08.070
in a developing country or a
developed country.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.841
The rate in developed countries
is 26 per 1,000 and in

00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:14.759
developing countries it's 29 per
1,000;

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.990
not a huge difference.
 

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:21.534
China, which everyone worries
about the forced abortions

00:10:21.534 --> 00:10:26.412
there, has about 20% of the
world's population and has about

00:10:26.412 --> 00:10:29.139
20% of the world's abortions.
 

00:10:29.139 --> 00:10:32.886
Another--the last number that
I'll tell you about that people

00:10:32.886 --> 00:10:34.881
calculate,
is what's called the total

00:10:34.881 --> 00:10:37.201
abortion rate,
which is calculated exactly in

00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:39.428
the same way as the total
fertility rate.

00:10:39.428 --> 00:10:43.350
You take the age specific
abortion rate and add it up,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.173
and it's the number of
abortions that the average woman

00:10:47.173 --> 00:10:51.210
would have in her lifetime if
she continues with the rates

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.460
that are present at the time you
collect the statistics.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.115
Again, I mention this,
in the world it's 0.9 very

00:10:59.115 --> 00:11:03.379
close to 1, the average woman
will have 1 abortion in her

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:04.370
lifetime.
 

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:08.640
It ranges from a low of 0.2,
one abortion per every five

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.679
women in several countries,
to a high of 1.7 in Cuba,

00:11:12.679 --> 00:11:16.019
almost two abortions per woman
in Cuba.

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:22.155
Well I'll talk later about a
very interesting situation in

00:11:22.155 --> 00:11:22.908
Cuba.
 

00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:26.744
Over time, as I said,
the number of abortions is

00:11:26.744 --> 00:11:30.414
really, on the big scale,
a couple of decades,

00:11:30.414 --> 00:11:32.700
staying pretty constant.
 

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.860
But, from the last compilation
in 1995, the estimate was 46

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.308
million abortions and now it's
down to 42 million abortions.

00:11:41.308 --> 00:11:44.320
There has been a very small
drop in the number of abortions.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:49.783
Where do you think all of that
drop has occurred?

00:11:49.783 --> 00:11:54.025
Eastern Europe;
again they had an extremely

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:57.510
high abortion rate,
it was the mechanism of

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.797
contraception there,
and they're gradually becoming

00:12:00.797 --> 00:12:04.019
accustomed to contraception so
their abortion rate is going

00:12:04.019 --> 00:12:06.923
down,
three-quarters of the change in

00:12:06.923 --> 00:12:10.490
the whole world is all due to
Eastern Europe.

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.460
The United States looks pretty
much like the rest of the world.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:21.042
There's 1 abortion for every
3.2 live births here which is

00:12:21.042 --> 00:12:26.428
exactly the number that is the
average for the world.

00:12:26.428 --> 00:12:30.481
In the United States there are
1.3 million abortions in again

00:12:30.481 --> 00:12:34.129
2003, the last time those
statistics were collected.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:43.019
The rate is 21.3 abortions per
1,000 women.

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:45.758
If you look per woman,
the U.S.

00:12:45.758 --> 00:12:49.500
looks a little better than per
births,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.879
that the total abortion rate
for the United States is 0.64

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:56.659
per woman,
that's mean two-thirds of--the

00:12:56.659 --> 00:13:00.101
average is two-thirds of women
will have an abortion during

00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.822
their lifetime,
whereas, the world is closer to

00:13:02.822 --> 00:13:03.080
one.
 

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:06.653
So, we have a somewhat lower
rate, and again,

00:13:06.653 --> 00:13:11.123
the difference is the use of
contraception and I'll talk

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.830
about that later.
 

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.159
The United States,
although somewhat better than

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:20.269
the world average in this,
is not nearly as good as 0.2;

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:21.879
remember I said ours is 0.64.
 

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:26.614
Belgium, Germany and
Switzerland all are down at 0.2,

00:13:26.614 --> 00:13:31.711
so less than a third of the
number of abortions per woman

00:13:31.711 --> 00:13:33.259
that we have.
 

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:38.666
A cohort of 1,000 women going
through their reproductive life

00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:42.053
will have 639 abortions,
and that's assuming,

00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:44.918
we currently have been having a
reducing rate of abortion,

00:13:44.918 --> 00:13:49.450
here it presumes that that rate
will stay down.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.801
Expanding out to the world
again, abortion can be a major

00:13:53.801 --> 00:13:58.628
method of fertility control,
especially when a country first

00:13:58.628 --> 00:14:01.668
goes through its fertility
transition.

00:14:01.668 --> 00:14:06.424
One of the fastest fertility
transitions in the world was in

00:14:06.424 --> 00:14:08.278
Japan, of all places.
 

00:14:08.278 --> 00:14:11.351
Where they halved the
birthrate--the birthrate in

00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:14.360
Japan was cut in half between
1947 and 1957,

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.804
in ten years it went down to
half, from 34 per 1,000 women to

00:14:18.804 --> 00:14:21.469
17,
and it's remained at that level

00:14:21.469 --> 00:14:25.548
more or less until 1979 and now
it's getting even lower.

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:35.288
Here is--this is the
interesting case of Japan.

00:14:35.288 --> 00:14:38.245
This is the years
1949--remember MacArthur,

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:42.256
the U.S. Administration of
Japan was still sort of tailing

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:46.548
down at that time and we're
looking at a ten year span.

00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:49.496
This is the number of
pregnancies, which is births

00:14:49.496 --> 00:14:52.065
plus abortions,
and you'll notice that during

00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:54.288
this time,
during this ten year time,

00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:57.755
the number of pregnancies
really does not change an awful

00:14:57.755 --> 00:15:00.409
lot;
notice 2,700 to

00:15:00.409 --> 00:15:05.000
2,900,2,600,2,800,2,800,2,600.
 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.490
So the number of pregnancies
does not change.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.100
But look what happens to
abortion.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:16.498
It gets legalized here and very
rapidly it goes from 100 to ten

00:15:16.498 --> 00:15:18.149
times as much.
 

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:21.158
Correspondingly,
the births go down,

00:15:21.158 --> 00:15:27.107
so abortion goes from an
insignificant fraction of births

00:15:27.107 --> 00:15:30.248
to a very--
so much, much closer to the

00:15:30.248 --> 00:15:31.418
number of births.
 

00:15:31.418 --> 00:15:35.048
In this case,
it was legalization of abortion

00:15:35.048 --> 00:15:36.779
that sort of,
boom.

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:40.558
caused the Japanese birthrate
to fall.

00:15:40.558 --> 00:15:44.941
There was no coercion involved
it was purely a legalization

00:15:44.941 --> 00:15:45.470
step.
 

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.567
In many places,
abortion is the method of birth

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:50.460
control.
 

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.910
So, in the Soviet Union,
the official statistics,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.548
before it fell apart,
were that there five to eight

00:15:59.548 --> 00:16:02.610
abortions lifetime per woman.
 

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:08.288
In the Ukraine it was ten to 12
abortions per woman.

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.690
The immigrants that come to
America say that's nonsense.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.702
That it was 20 to 30 that
everybody they know had 20 to 30

00:16:16.702 --> 00:16:18.548
abortions lifetime.
 

00:16:18.548 --> 00:16:21.443
Japan also, because,
although they legalized

00:16:21.443 --> 00:16:24.743
abortion very early,
they didn't legalize the pill

00:16:24.743 --> 00:16:26.830
until just a few years ago.
 

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:31.453
They legalized it when Viagra
came out and the men demanded to

00:16:31.453 --> 00:16:32.440
get Viagra.
 

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.775
-- They have a very good
national health plan,

00:16:34.775 --> 00:16:37.059
it's all free and very careful
and very good,

00:16:37.059 --> 00:16:38.668
and men wanted free Viagra.
 

00:16:38.668 --> 00:16:41.610
Then it became politically
impossible to keep the women

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.279
from having the pill,
but pay for men's Viagra.

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:47.672
So Japan legalized it very
recently, the pill,

00:16:47.672 --> 00:16:51.970
and their abortion rate has
always been extremely high.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:17:01.460
In some special circumstances
the abortion rates have gone sky

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.548
high.
 

00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:07.145
In 1966, in Romania,
there were 408 abortions for

00:17:07.145 --> 00:17:11.932
every 100 live births,
four abortions for every one

00:17:11.932 --> 00:17:13.368
live birth.
 

00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:17.858
The history of that is very,
very interesting.

00:17:17.858 --> 00:17:21.818
In the whole Soviet Bloc it was
a complex of issues.

00:17:21.818 --> 00:17:25.680
Contraception was legal,
it was kind of available but

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.130
the manufacturing was terrible.
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:32.150
They had condoms in the various
Soviet bloc countries but they

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:35.842
were so poorly made that the
people called them galoshes,

00:17:35.842 --> 00:17:37.490
they just didn't fit.
 

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:43.061
Plus, the doctors were working
for the government and not paid

00:17:43.061 --> 00:17:45.631
very well,
but they could privately,

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.618
outside the government
statistics,

00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:50.529
they could privately do
abortions and make money on it.

00:17:50.529 --> 00:17:53.041
So, the doctors were all
pushing abortion and for a

00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.400
variety of other reasons.
 

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:58.229
We'll talk more about countries
in which abortion is by far the

00:17:58.229 --> 00:18:00.329
dominant means of birth control.
 

00:18:06.098 --> 00:18:10.192
Legal and medically performed
abortion, by a trained doctor,

00:18:10.192 --> 00:18:13.940
is one of the safest methods of
birth control known.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.122
Here is the statistics on this,
this on this,

00:18:17.122 --> 00:18:21.680
this is from the--do you know
the Physician's Desk Reference?

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.859
For many years all of the birth
control pills had to have this

00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:26.819
graph in it.
 

00:18:26.819 --> 00:18:28.269
What do you see here?
 

00:18:28.269 --> 00:18:33.240
This is the annual deaths--four
women per 100,000 non-sterile

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.880
women who are either using or
not using birth control.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.630
What you notice,
the really high category,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:47.118
was the only super duper high,
is women over 40 who smoke;

00:18:47.118 --> 00:18:51.078
bad idea, and use the
pill--smoke and use the pill.

00:18:51.078 --> 00:18:53.990
That's the pill--the pill is
their method of contraception

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.858
and they smoke.
 

00:18:54.858 --> 00:18:58.287
If you're over 40 and you
smoke, don't use the pill,

00:18:58.287 --> 00:19:00.640
that's not a healthy thing to
do.

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.816
For every other category of
woman, the white bars are larger

00:19:04.816 --> 00:19:08.849
than any of the other bars,
and the white bar is not using

00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:10.618
contraception at all.
 

00:19:10.618 --> 00:19:13.028
What this tells you is,
if they're not using

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:15.401
contraception,
they're going to get pregnant

00:19:15.401 --> 00:19:18.001
and that the mortality dangers,
this is deaths,

00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:22.396
so this is mortality,
that the mortality dangers from

00:19:22.396 --> 00:19:28.265
pregnancy are a good bit higher
than any of the methods of birth

00:19:28.265 --> 00:19:29.288
control.
 

00:19:29.288 --> 00:19:31.519
Student:  What year was
that from?

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:32.068
Prof: What?
 

00:19:32.068 --> 00:19:32.950
Student:  What year was
this from?

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:37.742
Prof: This is,
I think, about 1990 and

00:19:37.742 --> 00:19:42.210
hasn't--well what has changed is
that--

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:47.519
let me finish and I'll tell you
what's changed since then.

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:51.098
The safest is these little
black bars,

00:19:51.098 --> 00:19:53.775
which you can hardly see,
which is traditional

00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:57.579
contraception which is condoms
is what they're talking about,

00:19:57.579 --> 00:19:59.288
backed up by abortion.
 

00:19:59.288 --> 00:20:03.823
That is the safest of all
methods, and then the other

00:20:03.823 --> 00:20:07.048
methods like diaphragm and
condom,

00:20:07.048 --> 00:20:13.028
IUD, pills for non-smokers,
abortion only,

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:16.769
are all sort of low but
intermediate.

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:19.539
The story is,
with the exception of older

00:20:19.539 --> 00:20:22.656
women who smoke,
the worst thing you can do is

00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:24.250
not use any method.
 

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.880
That's dangerous.
 

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.625
The best thing you can do is
use a condom backed up by

00:20:30.625 --> 00:20:31.608
abortion.
 

00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:36.048
That's surprising because
there's so much popular myth out

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:39.009
there that misconstrues these
facts.

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:42.970
Now what has changed is that
this data was taken in the

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:47.368
earlier days of birth control
pills which were high dose,

00:20:47.368 --> 00:20:48.318
and you've probably heard about
this.

00:20:48.318 --> 00:20:50.644
They used to have very high
dose because it was new,

00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:53.200
they didn't know about it,
and they wanted to be sure.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.170
The main thing was to prevent
pregnancy.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:58.255
Then they realized they could
get away with lower and lower

00:20:58.255 --> 00:21:01.339
doses and the pills nowadays
have much lower doses so there

00:21:01.339 --> 00:21:02.990
are much less side effects.
 

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:08.198
All of these columns would
probably be way,

00:21:08.198 --> 00:21:15.390
way down from what they were,
and that's what's changed.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.998
When you go the developing
world, this is United States

00:21:18.998 --> 00:21:22.338
data, when you go to the
developing world of course

00:21:22.338 --> 00:21:25.278
pregnancy itself is much more
dangerous.

00:21:25.278 --> 00:21:28.737
Childbirth is much more
dangerous so what you see is

00:21:28.737 --> 00:21:33.279
these white bars go an awful lot
higher depending on the country.

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:36.758
If you're in the middle of
Africa they're very high,

00:21:36.758 --> 00:21:40.373
if you're in other places
they're pretty much like the

00:21:40.373 --> 00:21:42.009
United States level.
 

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:49.065
Student:  These are
deaths associated with deaths

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:52.352
while giving birth or these are
deaths from side effects of the

00:21:52.352 --> 00:21:53.358
contraceptives?
 

00:21:53.358 --> 00:21:58.578
Prof: Both,
both, both, all of the above.

00:21:58.578 --> 00:22:03.260
Okay not only--so this just
shows you immediate mortality

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.019
and it's clear what's going on.
 

00:22:06.019 --> 00:22:10.666
Abortion apparently has no long
term clinical effects

00:22:10.666 --> 00:22:11.828
whatsoever.
 

00:22:11.828 --> 00:22:14.467
There's no physical affects,
again we're talking about

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:17.528
proper medically done abortions,
sterile abortions,

00:22:17.528 --> 00:22:20.460
properly done,
and there are no long term

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:23.327
clinical effects,
neither physical nor

00:22:23.327 --> 00:22:24.190
psychiatric.
 

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.709
It doesn't make women sterile,
doesn't increase the chance of

00:22:27.709 --> 00:22:30.759
sterility, it doesn't cause you
to go crazy later;

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:33.769
none of that stuff is
statistically true.

00:22:33.769 --> 00:22:37.164
Of course there are women who
either having an abortion or not

00:22:37.164 --> 00:22:39.949
having an abortion,
go through all these bad events

00:22:39.949 --> 00:22:42.118
but statistically they're the
same.

00:22:42.118 --> 00:22:45.272
The number of women who've had
an abortion and eventually go

00:22:45.272 --> 00:22:48.105
sterile would be the same as
those who have not had an

00:22:48.105 --> 00:22:50.190
abortion and eventually go
sterile.

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:53.598
Now that's medical sequelae.
 

00:22:53.598 --> 00:22:59.255
What the emotional content of
having an abortion is,

00:22:59.255 --> 00:23:03.470
that varies tremendously by
country.

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:05.625
We'll talk about some countries
where it's absolutely like a

00:23:05.625 --> 00:23:07.433
non-event,
having an abortion,

00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:11.646
and other places,
and other individuals where if

00:23:11.646 --> 00:23:14.344
their own ethics,
their own morality,

00:23:14.344 --> 00:23:16.777
their own desire for a child,
their religion,

00:23:16.777 --> 00:23:19.328
if it really is opposed to
abortion,

00:23:19.328 --> 00:23:23.970
then there can be a lot of
emotional difficulty with it.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:28.108
But that's not a thing to do
with the abortion itself,

00:23:28.108 --> 00:23:30.673
it's to do with the,
shall we say,

00:23:30.673 --> 00:23:35.492
the moral context in which that
woman perceives the abortion to

00:23:35.492 --> 00:23:36.970
have been done.
 

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.693
Along with this the--So,
you have these generally quite

00:23:40.693 --> 00:23:45.038
high rates of abortion around
the world and the question is,

00:23:45.038 --> 00:23:47.160
what are the determinants of
that rate?

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.240
What makes the rate higher?
 

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.420
What makes the rate lower?
 

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.901
Many people believe that
religious proscription,

00:23:52.901 --> 00:23:56.308
that the religion of the
country is what is the

00:23:56.308 --> 00:23:59.048
determining factor,
but it's not.

00:23:59.048 --> 00:24:02.134
For instance,
in Europe among Catholic

00:24:02.134 --> 00:24:05.751
countries,
Belgium has one of the lowest

00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:08.808
rates in the world 6.8 per
1,000,

00:24:08.808 --> 00:24:13.275
and Hungary another Catholic
country has one of the highest

00:24:13.275 --> 00:24:16.740
34.7 per 1,000 so you span the
whole range.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.546
Among Muslim countries,
Bangladesh has one of the

00:24:20.546 --> 00:24:24.986
lowest rates 3.8 while Turkey
has six or seven times that

00:24:24.986 --> 00:24:25.700
rate.
 

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.632
Again, the Bangladesh rate is a
little confused because of--they

00:24:30.632 --> 00:24:33.920
use a lot of menstrual
regulation there.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.048
The U.S.,a largely,
though not-exclusively,

00:24:37.048 --> 00:24:40.400
Protestant country,
has about the same rate as

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.220
Turkey.
 

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.960
Turkey is essentially all
Muslim, of course.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.842
People believe that the
Catholic Church,

00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:51.391
of course, teaches that
abortion is a mortal sin,

00:24:51.391 --> 00:24:52.500
its murder.
 

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.655
But, in the U.S.
 

00:24:53.655 --> 00:24:57.124
the abortion rate for
Protestants which is 17 per

00:24:57.124 --> 00:25:00.808
1,000 is lower than for
Catholics, 24 per 1,000.

00:25:00.808 --> 00:25:04.421
As far as one can tell,
Catholics, because of the

00:25:04.421 --> 00:25:08.935
church, slightly underuse birth
control, so, as compensation,

00:25:08.935 --> 00:25:11.568
they slightly overuse abortion.
 

00:25:11.568 --> 00:25:15.048
The error bars in all these
basically mean that there's a

00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:18.465
barely detectable difference
between say Protestants and

00:25:18.465 --> 00:25:21.930
Catholics within America,
within any one country.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.609
There are two issues of why the
Catholic rate is higher.

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:28.578
Yeah.
 

00:25:28.578 --> 00:25:30.680
Student:  Are these
lines per person or per 1000?

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.779
Prof: This is per 1,000.
 

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:34.961
Those are numbers per 1,000;
per 1,000 women of reproductive

00:25:34.961 --> 00:25:36.640
age not per 1,000 babies.
 

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.104
The Catholic thing is
most--most of the difference in

00:25:40.104 --> 00:25:44.103
that statistic is that there's a
large Hispanic population in

00:25:44.103 --> 00:25:47.367
America which happens to
Catholic and has a higher

00:25:47.367 --> 00:25:50.298
abortion rate than native born
women,

00:25:50.298 --> 00:25:53.166
so that is the most of the
reason why the Catholic rate is

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:53.619
higher.
 

00:25:57.269 --> 00:26:01.413
It's also--you can't tie it
down to legal proscription,

00:26:01.413 --> 00:26:04.558
whether abortion is legal or
not legal.

00:26:04.558 --> 00:26:08.298
You can't tie that down as a
determining factor in abortion

00:26:08.298 --> 00:26:08.880
either.
 

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.670
About half of the abortions in
the world are illegal.

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:16.880
The old statistics used the
word illegal,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.444
but now there is such a variety
of legal rules and such a

00:26:20.444 --> 00:26:24.519
variety of situations in each
country where it's legal or not.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:27.150
Now different states in
different countries,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.650
like in Mexico,
Mexico City has one law,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.818
each state can have a very
different law,

00:26:34.818 --> 00:26:39.084
so it gets to be difficult to
describe legality and that's all

00:26:39.084 --> 00:26:42.650
tied in with the safety which
we'll come back to.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.671
You see sometimes statistics
about safe abortion,

00:26:45.671 --> 00:26:48.252
sometimes statistics about
legal abortion,

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:51.588
and--usually they fit right on
top of each other.

00:26:51.588 --> 00:26:55.160
About half of abortions in the
world are illegal,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:59.218
the other half are legal,
and so for instance in Europe

00:26:59.218 --> 00:27:03.351
abortion is generally legal
everywhere under a very wide

00:27:03.351 --> 00:27:08.483
range of conditions,
and its abortion rate is 28 per

00:27:08.483 --> 00:27:09.220
1,000.
 

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.693
In Africa where it's illegal
almost everywhere it's 29,

00:27:14.693 --> 00:27:17.328
so again, no difference.
 

00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:20.170
The lowest rates in the world
are in western--

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:23.567
in northern Europe where
abortion is accessible with few

00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:27.558
restrictions so the total--
basically the total legality of

00:27:27.558 --> 00:27:31.318
abortion is in a place where the
rates are very low.

00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:35.258
Up to 2007 abortion was banned
in Mexico, so it was totally

00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:37.160
illegal everywhere Mexico.
 

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.026
Nevertheless,
the number of abortions rose by

00:27:41.026 --> 00:27:46.211
50% between 1990 and 2006 with a
constant legal situation of

00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:47.529
illegality.
 

00:27:47.529 --> 00:27:53.517
In 2006, Mexico's abortion's
rate was 40% higher than the

00:27:53.517 --> 00:27:53.944
U.S.
 

00:27:53.944 --> 00:27:55.868
rate next door.
 

00:27:55.868 --> 00:28:00.538
Here you have three countries
that are all in a line Canada,

00:28:00.538 --> 00:28:02.358
the U.S., and Mexico.
 

00:28:02.358 --> 00:28:05.753
Canada has much lower,
and the United States is in the

00:28:05.753 --> 00:28:08.380
middle and Mexico--those two are
legal;

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:11.808
in Mexico it's illegal and it
has the highest rate of all.

00:28:11.808 --> 00:28:16.528
Of course I should warn you,
and you probably realize it,

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:22.950
that saying that abortion
doesn't--you can't--

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:25.269
the legality is not the
determining factor,

00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:28.400
these intercontinental
comparisons,

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.691
or country comparison are not
terribly informative because so

00:28:31.691 --> 00:28:33.256
many--
between say Mexico and the

00:28:33.256 --> 00:28:35.251
United States,
or between Africa and Europe,

00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:37.801
there are so many variables,
so many socioeconomic

00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:39.854
variables, education,
medical care,

00:28:39.854 --> 00:28:41.944
standard of living,
all of this varies

00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:42.848
tremendously.
 

00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:46.507
The difference in abortion
rates is not to be found in the

00:28:46.507 --> 00:28:49.715
legal or illegal nature,
but in some of those other

00:28:49.715 --> 00:28:51.000
characteristics.
 

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.690
In most countries abortion is
legal,

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.509
and as of a few years ago,
61% of the world's people lived

00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:05.460
in countries where abortion is
permitted,

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:11.759
basically without restriction
or for a wide range of reasons.

00:29:11.759 --> 00:29:16.740
Only 25% live in places where
abortion is largely illegal.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.244
These are largely Latin
America, some of the Muslim

00:29:20.244 --> 00:29:23.538
countries, and Sub-Saharan
African countries.

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:28.269
Abortion is becoming legal in
more places.

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:34.924
From 1985 to 1998,19 nations
significantly liberalized their

00:29:34.924 --> 00:29:41.130
abortion laws and only Poland
de-legalized abortion,

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.778
which had to do with its
independence basically from the

00:29:44.778 --> 00:29:46.569
Soviet Union at the time.
 

00:29:46.569 --> 00:29:48.588
That was 1985 to 1998.
 

00:29:48.588 --> 00:29:51.440
From 1998 to 2007,
again the latest data,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.679
16 nations liberalized their
abortion laws and two

00:29:54.679 --> 00:29:58.182
territories and one state in
Australia liberalized its

00:29:58.182 --> 00:30:02.210
abortion laws,
and in Mexico I mentioned.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:07.537
Mexico City has now made
abortion in the first 12 weeks

00:30:07.537 --> 00:30:11.261
legal and that was in 19--
2007 I believe,

00:30:11.261 --> 00:30:14.599
and than a few states in Mexico
has followed that,

00:30:14.599 --> 00:30:17.818
so Mexico is now a split place.
 

00:30:17.818 --> 00:30:24.740
In this 1998 to 2007 time frame
El Salvador and Nicaragua,

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.080
which already had a very
restrictive abortion laws went

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.144
to absolute,
under no circumstances,

00:30:30.144 --> 00:30:33.311
abortion is totally--
no rape, no death--health of

00:30:33.311 --> 00:30:38.710
the mother,
no exceptions in Nicaragua and

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:40.630
El Salvador.
 

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.816
In contrast to the safety of
legal abortion,

00:30:43.816 --> 00:30:47.891
where abortions--when it's
legal it's almost always in a

00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:50.038
proper medical situation.
 

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:54.208
When it's illegal,
it's an extremely dangerous

00:30:54.208 --> 00:30:55.318
procedure.
 

00:30:55.318 --> 00:31:00.406
There's something like 67,000
abortion related deaths a year

00:31:00.406 --> 00:31:04.718
and that leaves 220,000,
a quarter million children

00:31:04.718 --> 00:31:06.960
without their mothers.
 

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.130
As you may know,
when it's illegal,

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:15.528
the main procedure is inserting
something up the uterus and

00:31:15.528 --> 00:31:21.816
scraping around to try to
dislodge the endometrium and the

00:31:21.816 --> 00:31:22.920
fetus.
 

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.747
Well, if you're scraping around
in there with a pointed stick or

00:31:25.747 --> 00:31:28.375
a hangar or something,
you're liable to puncture the

00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:31.127
uterine wall and make a hole
between the inside of the

00:31:31.127 --> 00:31:32.932
uterus,
which is open through the

00:31:32.932 --> 00:31:36.154
vaginal canal to the outside,
and the peritoneal cavity,

00:31:36.154 --> 00:31:40.133
the inside of your body and so
infection gets through that and

00:31:40.133 --> 00:31:43.423
so the main route isn't--
the main reason why

00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:48.272
abortion--illegal abortion is so
dangerous is that non-sterility

00:31:48.272 --> 00:31:51.200
of whatever it is that's
inserted,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:56.170
plus it's pointed usually,
and they break right through

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:57.920
the uterine wall.
 

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.875
In addition,
you may know that the fallopian

00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:05.068
tube is open into the peritoneal
cavity because the ovary,

00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:08.556
which releases the egg is--it
sits right on top of the

00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:12.306
fallopian tube and the egg is
released into the peritoneal

00:32:12.306 --> 00:32:14.837
space,
the body fluid here and it's

00:32:14.837 --> 00:32:18.843
supposed to drop down into the
fallopian tube and cilia push it

00:32:18.843 --> 00:32:19.358
down.
 

00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:23.519
That's an opening so if you get
something unsterile into the

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:27.749
womb and then the bacteria can
swim upstream and get into the

00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:32.049
body and then you're into sepsis
and you very likely die.

00:32:36.048 --> 00:32:43.109
It's a very dangerous procedure
when done not properly.

00:32:47.118 --> 00:32:51.612
There are very good statistics
showing that the main

00:32:51.612 --> 00:32:56.721
determinant of the maternal
death rate from abortion is its

00:32:56.721 --> 00:32:58.220
legal status.
 

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:04.440
Here again, although I don't
think I showed this slide,

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:07.940
so here is places where
abortion is legal,

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.695
here's the abortion rate,
this goes back to saying that

00:33:10.695 --> 00:33:13.808
the legal situation doesn't
determine the rate of abortion.

00:33:13.808 --> 00:33:20.030
Here are various abortion legal
places and the rate is about 6

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:23.585
to 26,
and here it's illegal and you

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:28.978
have the range of 23 to 52,
so ballpark double or triple

00:33:28.978 --> 00:33:30.859
this rate,
so it's illegal.

00:33:30.859 --> 00:33:32.759
These are all South America.
 

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:36.198
This is all Europe,
Japan, Australia,

00:33:36.198 --> 00:33:40.210
United States,
very developed countries.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.288
Countries that are partially
developed shall we say.

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:49.212
The illegality correlates with
the abortion rate but it's

00:33:49.212 --> 00:33:54.766
almost certainly not the cause,
certainly being illegal is not

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:57.048
causing these high abortion
rates.

00:33:57.048 --> 00:34:01.521
Now when you go over and look
at the maternal deaths you see

00:34:01.521 --> 00:34:04.519
that there are ten,
the developed regions have an

00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:07.412
average of ten,
whereas in Latin America you

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:11.670
have up in the 100 and 200,
and even up to 300 range.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:14.590
You go to Africa it's 650.
 

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.778
There the illegality really
does make a difference in the

00:34:18.778 --> 00:34:23.143
maternal death rate,
that's the dominant effect of

00:34:23.143 --> 00:34:27.027
making something illegal is--
doesn't change the abortion

00:34:27.027 --> 00:34:28.730
rate and we have a number of
examples,

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.666
but it changes the maternal
death rate very,

00:34:33.666 --> 00:34:35.389
very clearly.
 

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:39.045
The most extreme example of
this and the clearest example of

00:34:39.045 --> 00:34:40.469
this is from Romania.
 

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:48.173
Romania had during--after World
War II when it was a Soviet

00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:51.123
puppet state,
as I told you,

00:34:51.123 --> 00:34:53.768
the abortion rate was
extraordinarily high,

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:56.650
like four abortions for every
one live birth.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:01.619
Because--well they had a
dictator then,

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:04.177
Nicolai Ceausescu,
who you've undoubtedly have

00:35:04.177 --> 00:35:06.085
heard of,
and he decided that for the

00:35:06.085 --> 00:35:08.719
glory of greater Romania there
should be more Romanians,

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:13.659
he wanted a big strong state,
so he went on a pronatalist

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:14.630
campaign.
 

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:17.327
Abortion was immediately
criminalized,

00:35:17.327 --> 00:35:21.485
contraceptives became very hard
to get hard, they wouldn't

00:35:21.485 --> 00:35:24.840
import them, they didn't
manufacture them.

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:29.795
So what he did was that all
women between 18 and 45 were

00:35:29.795 --> 00:35:33.985
rounded up at their workplace,
remember this is a socialist

00:35:33.985 --> 00:35:35.679
state so almost all the women
worked,

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:37.559
they were rounded up at their
workplace,

00:35:37.559 --> 00:35:40.340
and subjected to a
gynecological examination.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:44.057
If they were not
pregnant they had to explain to

00:35:44.057 --> 00:35:46.739
the government why they were not
pregnant.

00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:51.670
It was about as intrusive a
pronatalist campaign as you can

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.518
imagine.
 

00:35:52.518 --> 00:35:58.148
It's somewhat the mirror image
of China's anti-birth campaign,

00:35:58.148 --> 00:36:01.469
and Romania had the plus
campaign.

00:36:01.469 --> 00:36:05.284
Anyway, what happened
immediately--so previously 80%

00:36:05.284 --> 00:36:09.396
of pregnancies had been
ending--had been terminated with

00:36:09.396 --> 00:36:10.369
abortion.
 

00:36:10.369 --> 00:36:12.599
Abortion disappears,
and was legal,

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:15.945
abortion had been legal,
and boom the birthrate does

00:36:15.945 --> 00:36:18.775
indeed go up;
nothing like by a factor of

00:36:18.775 --> 00:36:22.269
five but something like a factor
two as I remember but I

00:36:22.269 --> 00:36:24.050
want--should--check that.
 

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:27.210
Then, very rapidly,
women set up networks of

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:31.621
illegal abortion providers and
the birth rate goes up and the

00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:36.103
birth rate comes back down and
it ends up somewhat higher than

00:36:36.103 --> 00:36:42.518
it had been beforehand,
but not enormously higher.

00:36:42.518 --> 00:36:45.920
The maternal death rate is what
changed.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:50.518
It rose to 200 per 100,000 live
births, from a number in a

00:36:50.518 --> 00:36:54.550
developed country that was
something in the tens or

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.599
twenties.
 

00:36:55.599 --> 00:37:00.500
It ranged up to ten times that
amount.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:03.690
The infant mortality rate,
because these mothers didn't

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.922
want these children,
presumably, the infant

00:37:06.922 --> 00:37:11.179
mortality rate rose to 83 deaths
per 1,000 from--

00:37:11.179 --> 00:37:15.878
Japan's rate is 4.8,
the U.S.

00:37:15.878 --> 00:37:20.409
is 8.9, so it rose to 83.
 

00:37:20.409 --> 00:37:23.699
So again, something like a ten
times increase in infant

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:24.429
mortality.
 

00:37:24.429 --> 00:37:28.047
The main effect of
de-legalizing abortion was a

00:37:28.047 --> 00:37:32.923
temporary rise in the number of
births but a long term increase

00:37:32.923 --> 00:37:36.699
in maternal mortality and infant
mortality,

00:37:36.699 --> 00:37:38.699
a massive increase.
 

00:37:38.699 --> 00:37:43.722
By the time abortion--of course
when they got free of the

00:37:43.722 --> 00:37:46.846
dictator--
it was legalized again and

00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:49.615
then, by that time,
things had come back a little

00:37:49.615 --> 00:37:50.039
to normal.
 

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:51.630
But still, the maternal death
rate,

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.139
as soon as they legalized
abortion,

00:37:53.139 --> 00:37:56.030
the maternal death rate dropped
by a factor three,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.980
so that's Romania's nice
example.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.164
In South Africa,
more recently,

00:38:01.164 --> 00:38:04.659
this was in the late 1960s,
the Romania story.

00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:09.045
In South Africa the abortion
law was liberalized and the

00:38:09.045 --> 00:38:14.309
incidence of maternal infection
due to abortion dropped in half.

00:38:14.309 --> 00:38:20.141
In all cases the major effect
of making abortion illegal is an

00:38:20.141 --> 00:38:22.820
increase in complications.
 

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.161
You don't change the abortion
rate, but medical complications,

00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:30.579
death of the mother,
and death of the infants.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.521
The fundamental--we've been
going through things that are

00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:38.588
not the cause of the high
abortion rates,

00:38:38.588 --> 00:38:41.119
it's not the religion,
it's not the legality.

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:45.409
The fundamental causes of--kind
of obvious--is unintended

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:46.329
pregnancy.
 

00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:49.623
You may remember that
these--there are very high rates

00:38:49.623 --> 00:38:51.239
of unintended pregnancy.
 

00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:55.119
--Here is a comparison of two
regions,

00:38:55.119 --> 00:38:58.599
almost all legal in the
developed countries and in

00:38:58.599 --> 00:39:02.574
almost all of Africa it's
illegal and the death rate's an

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:06.739
enormous,
enormous difference there.

00:39:06.739 --> 00:39:10.349
You may remember these
statistics, just to refresh your

00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:12.690
memory, about unwanted
fertility.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:17.659
This is 71% of living women
want to stop having children.

00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:21.289
Yet, as I showed you before,
they have more--

00:39:21.289 --> 00:39:23.650
they continue to have children
because they're not using

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.931
contraception,
they don't have enough

00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:26.989
contraception.
 

00:39:26.989 --> 00:39:28.230
That's Bolivia.
 

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:31.268
This is from the previous
lecture around the world,

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:34.150
remember this is the line where
people--

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.230
this is how many children
people are having,

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.079
this is how many they want,
this is the line where they're

00:39:40.079 --> 00:39:40.480
equal.
 

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:42.559
All countries,
all developing countries are

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:44.440
having more children than they
want.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:48.409
There's a large amount of unmet
need in the world.

00:39:48.409 --> 00:39:52.059
The estimate for the world is
108 million women.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:00.239
Since there's an unmet need,
these women who don't want to

00:40:00.239 --> 00:40:04.291
have more children yet do,
that results in some 51 million

00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:06.210
unintended pregnancies.
 

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.846
Of those using contraception,
another 25 million happen as a

00:40:10.846 --> 00:40:13.911
result of incorrect,
inconsistent use of

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:16.739
contraception or method failure.
 

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:22.530
You have something like 80
million unwanted pregnancies.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.757
In the world there are 210
million pregnancies annually,

00:40:27.757 --> 00:40:31.369
and about 40% of them are
unplanned.

00:40:31.369 --> 00:40:34.154
About a quarter of--We know,
from a lot of places,

00:40:34.154 --> 00:40:37.449
that when there's an unplanned
pregnancy about a quarter of

00:40:37.449 --> 00:40:38.869
them end in abortion.
 

00:40:38.869 --> 00:40:46.014
The main sequence is:
unwanted pregnancy and then

00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:49.139
high abortion rate.
 

00:40:49.139 --> 00:40:54.862
Most unintended pregnancies in
the world--most unintended

00:40:54.862 --> 00:40:59.360
pregnancies are in the developed
counties.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.742
So there's a difference here
between developed and

00:41:00.742 --> 00:41:01.420
undeveloped countries.
 

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:05.943
Contraception is very available
and highly used in the developed

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:08.637
world,
so in the developed world most

00:41:08.637 --> 00:41:11.780
unintended pregnancies are
people who are using

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.184
contraception,
and using it fairly accurately,

00:41:15.184 --> 00:41:20.039
but there's a method failure,
the contraception just fails.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:25.460
You have to remember that a
woman is fertile for say 30

00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:27.469
years of her life.
 

00:41:27.469 --> 00:41:31.088
She has 12 monthly cycles in a
year, a little bit more

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:35.047
actually, a cycle is 28 days in
principle, but that's close

00:41:35.047 --> 00:41:35.800
enough.
 

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:40.751
In order to not have an
unintended pregnancy her

00:41:40.751 --> 00:41:45.599
contraception must be perfect
for 30 years,

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:48.190
12 cycles a year,
that's an awful lot to expect

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:52.469
of a contraceptive,
and contraceptives are just not

00:41:52.469 --> 00:41:53.550
that good.
 

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.659
So, in developed countries
also, the main reason for

00:41:57.659 --> 00:42:01.447
unintended pregnancy,
it's very heavily--married

00:42:01.447 --> 00:42:04.510
women who are using
contraception.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.802
They usually have several
children already,

00:42:06.802 --> 00:42:08.440
and the contraception fails.
 

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.260
That's the main reason in
developed countries.

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:17.222
In developing countries where
contraception use is less

00:42:17.222 --> 00:42:22.460
prevalent, the main reason is
non-use of contraception.

00:42:25.789 --> 00:42:27.884
There is a very strong
relationship between

00:42:27.884 --> 00:42:29.329
contraception and abortion.
 

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:32.871
-- So, we have a country,
most countries,

00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:36.518
with this unmet need;
women, before you start

00:42:36.518 --> 00:42:39.739
collecting statistics,
want fewer children than

00:42:39.739 --> 00:42:42.679
they're having but it's not a
big deal.

00:42:42.679 --> 00:42:45.572
Then something changes,
could be a mechanism that we've

00:42:45.572 --> 00:42:47.929
discussed the reasons of
cultural change,

00:42:47.929 --> 00:42:49.586
and economic change,
or whatever,

00:42:49.586 --> 00:42:52.539
and people really start wanting
to have fewer children.

00:42:52.539 --> 00:42:56.463
This happened around 1964 in
Korea and you read--and I gave

00:42:56.463 --> 00:43:00.659
you one of the stories about how
an example of how this happens

00:43:00.659 --> 00:43:01.539
in Korea.
 

00:43:01.539 --> 00:43:05.036
What happens is as women--as
the whole culture changes from

00:43:05.036 --> 00:43:08.833
wanting sort of the maximum rate
of fertility to wanting a lower

00:43:08.833 --> 00:43:12.271
rate of fertility,
the contraception--the abortion

00:43:12.271 --> 00:43:16.373
rate takes off first because in
all these countries abortion is

00:43:16.373 --> 00:43:18.775
the traditional method,
the women know it,

00:43:18.775 --> 00:43:20.179
and are moderately comfortable
with it,

00:43:20.179 --> 00:43:23.489
so you see first the abortion
rate starts going up.

00:43:23.489 --> 00:43:26.724
Then, with a short lag,
the contraception rate goes up,

00:43:26.724 --> 00:43:29.721
because all the countries
establish national family

00:43:29.721 --> 00:43:31.039
planning programs.
 

00:43:31.039 --> 00:43:37.690
What happens is people use more
abortion,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.735
use more contraception,
so they're reducing their

00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:43.443
fertility,
but the rate of drop of desired

00:43:43.443 --> 00:43:46.969
fertility can be so fast that
even the sum of contraception

00:43:46.969 --> 00:43:49.340
and abortion can't keep up with
it,

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:51.139
so both rates keep rising.
 

00:43:51.139 --> 00:43:54.260
Eventually you peak.
 

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.230
Abortion peaks and starts
falling down,

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.809
contraception continues upward.
 

00:43:59.809 --> 00:44:04.192
This is the time when the
demand to have less fertility is

00:44:04.192 --> 00:44:07.730
more than either method alone
can cope with.

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:12.159
Eventually women--and abortion
is easier because the post--

00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:17.543
it's an after the fact method,
but eventually women learn to

00:44:17.543 --> 00:44:21.760
use contraception--
learn to use it and learn to

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:26.690
use it properly and so then the
abortion rate declines as the

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:31.539
contraception rate continues on
up to very high levels,

00:44:31.539 --> 00:44:34.295
and most of the difference here
is women who want to get

00:44:34.295 --> 00:44:35.500
pregnant or something.
 

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.960
You have this trade off.
 

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.590
You have, in an early stage,
both of them rise together and

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.659
at a later stage they do very
divergent things.

00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:49.059
You'll see when you get a
polemicized discussion of this,

00:44:49.059 --> 00:44:52.099
what you'd hear is right to
life people say,

00:44:52.099 --> 00:44:54.753
'contraception is no good,
abortion rises with

00:44:54.753 --> 00:44:57.998
contraception' and they use
statistics from this half on

00:44:57.998 --> 00:44:58.530
down.
 

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:01.157
People who are pro-choice say
'no, no, no or are

00:45:01.157 --> 00:45:04.065
pro-contraception no,
no, no it goes this way and the

00:45:04.065 --> 00:45:05.800
use this half of the graph.
 

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.199
But you get both of these
things.

00:45:08.199 --> 00:45:10.179
Korea is one example.
 

00:45:10.179 --> 00:45:14.722
Here is another example of the
relationship between

00:45:14.722 --> 00:45:18.630
contraception and abortion in
Bangladesh.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.400
Here is--remember Matlab--you
read about Matlab where they

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:26.106
chose some villages and got a
very strong family planning

00:45:26.106 --> 00:45:30.009
program and then other villages
which they left as a control

00:45:30.009 --> 00:45:30.869
region.
 

00:45:30.869 --> 00:45:32.996
They had family planning
because they had the government

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:35.240
program, but the government
program wasn't any near as good

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.480
as the intervention program.
 

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.280
Here's the control region and a
lot to see here.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:45.920
First of all this is desired
fertility and that starts at

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.460
this level and drops down to
somewhat more than half;

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:55.434
desired fertility in the Matlab
region starts at about the same

00:45:55.434 --> 00:45:58.000
level and falls about the same
amount.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.501
The difference between the two
regions is not desired

00:46:00.501 --> 00:46:01.079
fertility.
 

00:46:01.079 --> 00:46:05.989
The actual fertility rate drops
here, starts higher and drops a

00:46:05.989 --> 00:46:09.630
little faster here,
so that it ends up not very

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.739
different.
 

00:46:10.739 --> 00:46:14.224
Again, the difference is not
the actual amount of fertility,

00:46:14.224 --> 00:46:17.295
which the number of births
isn't enormously different

00:46:17.295 --> 00:46:18.949
between the two regions.
 

00:46:18.949 --> 00:46:23.909
In Matlab--in the experimental
region,

00:46:23.909 --> 00:46:26.110
the region where they had the
good program,

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:29.766
the contraceptive prevalence
goes very high or goes rapidly

00:46:29.766 --> 00:46:32.099
very high from something like
30%,

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:33.768
more than doubles to 70%.
 

00:46:33.768 --> 00:46:39.849
Whereas, in the other--in the
non-control region you have--

00:46:39.849 --> 00:46:44.039
it starts much lower--this
rises very rapidly,

00:46:44.039 --> 00:46:46.070
this doesn't change at all for
a number of years,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.242
then the government--actually
the government improves its

00:46:48.242 --> 00:46:50.768
program,
it jumps up a little bit.

00:46:50.768 --> 00:46:53.867
So it's the contraceptive,
this is a really big

00:46:53.867 --> 00:46:57.311
difference,
the contraceptive prevalence is

00:46:57.311 --> 00:47:02.639
much lower in the control region
than in the experimental region.

00:47:02.639 --> 00:47:05.650
The result is:
here's the abortion ratio in

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:09.378
the region where the
contraceptive prevalence is very

00:47:09.378 --> 00:47:13.608
high and here the abortion ratio
goes crazy where they don't

00:47:13.608 --> 00:47:16.963
have--
they're not using contraception

00:47:16.963 --> 00:47:18.010
efficiently.
 

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:20.670
Again here you can see in those
two regions the same country,

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.710
the same time,
neighboring villages,

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:28.980
neighboring districts that
the--there's this tradeoff.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:31.900
They either use contraception
or they use abortion.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.170
Both places,
they're wanting fewer children

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.284
as time goes on,
but in one case they use

00:47:38.284 --> 00:47:42.800
contraception and in the other
case they use abortion.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:46.340
Here's another example of this,
rather different in Shanghai.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:50.409
This is a more complicated,
somewhat interesting case.

00:47:50.409 --> 00:47:54.268
This is the one-child policy
comes in.

00:47:54.268 --> 00:47:57.784
They're only allowed one child,
so they have that child and

00:47:57.784 --> 00:48:01.360
then they try to do something to
avoid the second child,

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.688
and what they use is
contraceptive methods and they

00:48:06.688 --> 00:48:10.322
don't work,
they start with very--let me

00:48:10.322 --> 00:48:12.159
get this straight here.
 

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:19.123
They start with a low use of
IUD which is a really secure

00:48:19.123 --> 00:48:23.309
method of contraception and the
abortion rate is very high and

00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:27.358
they rather rapidly learn that
IUD is the only really secure

00:48:27.358 --> 00:48:31.409
way of not getting pregnant and
then the abortion rate falls

00:48:31.409 --> 00:48:34.005
down,
so it's another rather

00:48:34.005 --> 00:48:38.391
different situation in which
again the abortion rate and the

00:48:38.391 --> 00:48:43.150
effective contraceptive rate are
mirror images of each other.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:47.956
When you have a high rate of
effective contraception you have

00:48:47.956 --> 00:48:49.960
a low rate of abortion.
 

00:48:59.239 --> 00:49:02.190
Latin America shows this same
pattern.

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:06.710
In Latin America abortions have
been practiced for centuries.

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:10.079
It was certainly practiced by
the Incas and the Aztecs.

00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:14.130
In 1551 the Bishop of Venezuela
reported to the King of Spain

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:18.519
that the natives did not want
their children to become slaves,

00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:21.380
so they aborted them, 1551.
 

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:25.829
Chile has very good medical
statistics.

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:30.025
At the beginning of Chile's
fertility transition in the

00:49:30.025 --> 00:49:34.375
1960s 23% of Chilean women
voluntarily admitted to having

00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:36.239
an induced abortion.
 

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:39.351
Again, remember Chile is very
heavily a Catholic country and

00:49:39.351 --> 00:49:42.516
this is not really delving into
medical records or making any

00:49:42.516 --> 00:49:43.360
corrections.
 

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.018
This is just asking the women,
Have you had an abortion?'

00:49:45.018 --> 00:49:47.760
and a quarter of them say,
yes I've had an abortion.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.474
Not only did they have an
abortion but most of them had

00:49:52.474 --> 00:49:55.530
more than one abortion,
up to three,

00:49:55.530 --> 00:50:00.070
8.4% of the women had more than
seven abortions.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:04.469
This is early on.
 

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:08.260
Ten years later in the 1970s
now it's--

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.119
where women are really into
their fertility decline,

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:15.442
they don't want the children,
the average woman has almost

00:50:15.442 --> 00:50:21.079
three abortions,
lifetime, so that goes up.

00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:24.222
Again, those are the openly
admitted numbers and the real

00:50:24.222 --> 00:50:26.300
numbers must have been much
higher.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:30.268
Again, as in elsewhere,
in Chile almost all the women

00:50:30.268 --> 00:50:33.197
were married,
almost all middle class women,

00:50:33.197 --> 00:50:36.099
and they already had had four
to six pregnancies,

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:39.949
they already had children,
and experience with pregnancy.

00:50:39.949 --> 00:50:43.623
In terms of socioeconomic
levels, middle class women had

00:50:43.623 --> 00:50:46.429
more abortions than working
class women.

00:50:46.429 --> 00:50:51.922
Married women had a greater
abortion rate than those living

00:50:51.922 --> 00:50:56.460
in temporary unions,
and in all--through all this

00:50:56.460 --> 00:51:01.264
time abortion was completely
illegal in Chile and it still

00:51:01.264 --> 00:51:01.768
is.
 

00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:08.139
Going next door to Peru,
in Lima in the 1970s,

00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:10.268
again the time when the
fertility was going down,

00:51:10.268 --> 00:51:13.210
when people were wanting fewer
children in Peru,

00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.550
the yearly increase in the
abortion rate was 24%,

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:20.320
every year there was a 24%
increase in abortion.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:24.280
In any given year a quarter to
a third of the reproductive age

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.509
women would have abortions,
that's one out four,

00:51:27.509 --> 00:51:31.219
one out of three women every
year would have an abortion.

00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:39.882
Again, it's in this--the really
high abortion rates are when

00:51:39.882 --> 00:51:42.967
women are--
or families are starting to

00:51:42.967 --> 00:51:47.072
want fewer children and haven't
yet really figured out how to

00:51:47.072 --> 00:51:48.510
use contraception.
 

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.780
In contemporary Latin America
abortion,

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.480
although it's illegal almost
everywhere and it's almost

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:59.699
universally a Catholic place,
abortion is very widespread.

00:51:59.699 --> 00:52:04.735
Latin America as a whole has 1
abortion for every 2 live

00:52:04.735 --> 00:52:07.673
births;
remember worldwide and in the

00:52:07.673 --> 00:52:07.965
U.S.
 

00:52:07.965 --> 00:52:11.246
it's 1 per 3.2,
Latin American has 1 for every

00:52:11.246 --> 00:52:12.559
2 live births.
 

00:52:12.559 --> 00:52:15.978
Eventually there's a
generational change and the

00:52:15.978 --> 00:52:19.688
younger women start using
contraception and then the

00:52:19.688 --> 00:52:22.090
abortion rate starts to fall.
 

00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:38.213
The Philippines,
another example--in the

00:52:38.213 --> 00:52:45.764
Philippines have a very
interesting situation of the

00:52:45.764 --> 00:52:47.690
politics.
 

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.172
There's a strong
inter-relationship between the

00:52:51.172 --> 00:52:54.503
politics of the country,
the Catholic Church,

00:52:54.503 --> 00:52:57.760
and the citizen's use of
contraception.

00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.385
When Fidel Ramos was President,
one of the early very populist

00:53:03.385 --> 00:53:06.539
president's,
he supported family planning

00:53:06.539 --> 00:53:10.077
and a quarter of the Filipino
women were using the modern

00:53:10.077 --> 00:53:10.710
method.
 

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:15.340
Since then the desired
fertility has gone down in the

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:20.773
Philippines and now more than
half of Filipino women want some

00:53:20.773 --> 00:53:23.090
form of birth control.
 

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.869
But the presidency has changed
and a woman,

00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:30.965
Gloria Arroyo Macapagal,
came in and since Ferdinand

00:53:30.965 --> 00:53:36.106
Marcos was a strong dictator and
they had strong presidencies but

00:53:36.106 --> 00:53:39.697
then,
when he was kicked out for

00:53:39.697 --> 00:53:44.309
massive corruption and
dictatorial means,

00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:46.777
they now have democratic
elections and the governments

00:53:46.777 --> 00:53:47.849
have been quite weak.
 

00:53:47.849 --> 00:53:50.757
They don't have much popular
support and so the government

00:53:50.757 --> 00:53:53.766
needs to get legitimacy from
somewhere and in this case they

00:53:53.766 --> 00:53:56.469
get legitimacy from the Catholic
Church because,

00:53:56.469 --> 00:53:58.610
again, the Philippines is a
very Catholic country.

00:53:58.610 --> 00:54:02.952
A fairly open deal was made
between Macapagal and the

00:54:02.952 --> 00:54:08.047
archbishop of the Philippines
that the church will support you

00:54:08.047 --> 00:54:13.226
if you make abortion illegal and
get rid of the family planning

00:54:13.226 --> 00:54:14.480
programs.
 

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:19.469
Now the government--and that
was taken and she got elected --

00:54:19.469 --> 00:54:23.476
and now the government only
supports the traditional family

00:54:23.476 --> 00:54:30.590
planning method,
which is withdrawal basically.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:31.670
This had an effect.
 

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:35.900
So from 1993 to 1998 in the
five, six year period,

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:40.737
the use of traditional methods
went up by 50% while the use of

00:54:40.737 --> 00:54:44.300
modern methods didn't--
actually didn't change much.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:49.059
When the government pushes
something it often goes up and

00:54:49.059 --> 00:54:53.650
all those traditional methods
just plain don't work.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:57.920
The result was that the number
of abortions in the Philippines

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.190
in these years increased by 19%
from 400,000 which was already

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:05.347
high--
from 400,000 it went up to

00:55:05.347 --> 00:55:08.940
basically a half a million
abortions.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.289
They're all illegal of course.
 

00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:19.206
As I said in the beginning,
in America abortion is a great

00:55:19.206 --> 00:55:21.070
source of controversy.
 

00:55:21.070 --> 00:55:24.764
This is not always the case in
a lot of places,

00:55:24.764 --> 00:55:29.181
so there's a lot of literature
now on what they call the

00:55:29.181 --> 00:55:31.110
culture of abortion.
 

00:55:31.110 --> 00:55:35.552
Those countries for whom
abortion has a non-controversial

00:55:35.552 --> 00:55:39.438
place as a mechanism for
fertility control just as

00:55:39.438 --> 00:55:44.199
contraception has a more or less
non-controversial place as a

00:55:44.199 --> 00:55:48.800
form of fertility control in say
Europe and America.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:54.190
I got invited a few years back
to talk to the women's health

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:58.304
class about abortion and--
it was one of the things we

00:55:58.304 --> 00:56:00.934
talked about,
and afterwards I was talking

00:56:00.934 --> 00:56:04.273
with some students and a
professor with the next class

00:56:04.273 --> 00:56:08.307
walks in and he turned out to be
from Russia and he asked us what

00:56:08.307 --> 00:56:10.010
are you talking about?
 

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.643
The students had started asking
me questions about--something

00:56:12.643 --> 00:56:13.389
about abortion.
 

00:56:13.389 --> 00:56:15.789
He was really puzzled;
he said 'abortion,

00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:17.250
why is anybody interested in
that?'

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:20.985
Because in Russia it's just an
ordinary, absolutely ordinary

00:56:20.985 --> 00:56:23.420
kind of thing;
in places like Romania,

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:26.820
and I'm sure this is to some
degree true in probably the

00:56:26.820 --> 00:56:28.489
whole of eastern Europe.
 

00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:32.188
Remember, I mentioned to you
the old theory that the health

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:34.550
of the body depends on the
humors,

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:37.590
that you've got four humors of
bile,

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:40.097
and choler, and all this other
stuff and it's the balance

00:56:40.097 --> 00:56:40.949
that's important.
 

00:56:40.949 --> 00:56:44.150
You have to reestablish--What
the menstrual period does,

00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:46.590
everyone knows the worst fluid
is menstrual fluid,

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:50.500
and so you've got to get rid of
that and if you don't--

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.840
if you're not periodically
getting rid of menstrual fluid,

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.985
the bad spirits humors,
fluids, build up in you and you

00:56:57.985 --> 00:56:59.510
get unhealthy.
 

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.771
In places like Romania,
many people,

00:57:01.771 --> 00:57:05.456
older less educated people,
believe that it's good to have

00:57:05.456 --> 00:57:07.460
an abortion every so often.
 

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:10.231
Having nothing to do with
pregnancy even,

00:57:10.231 --> 00:57:14.250
it's just good to do that to
get rid of this evil humor.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:19.007
That has persisted as well as a
lot of other really

00:57:19.007 --> 00:57:21.677
unbelievable--
almost unbelievable to us,

00:57:21.677 --> 00:57:24.150
medical myths and is part of
the reason for that very,

00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:28.099
very high abortion rate in
Romania.

00:57:28.099 --> 00:57:31.527
In the Ukraine,
when the Soviet Union fell

00:57:31.527 --> 00:57:33.851
apart,
the family planning programs

00:57:33.851 --> 00:57:38.373
that they had also fell apart,
and so the whole area was left

00:57:38.373 --> 00:57:41.550
without effective family
planning.

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.396
The International Planned
Parenthood Federation,

00:57:44.396 --> 00:57:47.728
their nearest office was in
Bangkok and so they couldn't

00:57:47.728 --> 00:57:48.880
help very much.
 

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.601
What they did is,
they said, we'll take just the

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:55.019
city of Moscow because it's most
cost effective to work in a

00:57:55.019 --> 00:57:56.384
city,
a lot of people,

00:57:56.384 --> 00:57:58.050
we don't have geographic
access,

00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:00.969
but, we'll try to provide some
contraception in Moscow.

00:58:00.969 --> 00:58:03.949
That left all the other Soviet
Bloc countries with nothing.

00:58:03.949 --> 00:58:07.090
The Planned Parenthood
Federation of Connecticut here,

00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:08.820
I was associated with them at
the time,

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.445
got in contact with the
Ukraine--the whole Ukraine was

00:58:12.445 --> 00:58:14.909
left like bereft of
contraception.

00:58:14.909 --> 00:58:20.699
Got in touch with the main--the
head and the university in Kiev,

00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:24.239
the head of the OB/GYN
Department, a very nice woman,

00:58:24.239 --> 00:58:29.478
and started to help her
provide--buy contraceptives here

00:58:29.478 --> 00:58:31.670
and ship them abroad.
 

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:33.784
Actually we buy them
internationally,

00:58:33.784 --> 00:58:37.250
very cheap, a cycle of pills is
$.80 on the world market.

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:42.659
A condom is like a penny and a
half, diaphragm is $1.25.

00:58:42.659 --> 00:58:45.190
So, if you buy them in the
United States they're expensive.

00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:47.905
If you buy them in India or
wherever they're made,

00:58:47.905 --> 00:58:50.954
the things are a lot of
cheaper, so we could really help

00:58:50.954 --> 00:58:51.619
Ukraine.
 

00:58:51.619 --> 00:58:54.849
What they wanted first
was--because you can't use any

00:58:54.849 --> 00:58:58.452
of these things if there's
pelvic infections so they wanted

00:58:58.452 --> 00:59:01.931
Monistat and other treatments
for vaginal infections as a

00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:04.913
first line and than they could
start dealing with

00:59:04.913 --> 00:59:06.280
contraception.
 

00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.811
Anyway, this program went on
but it wasn't very successful

00:59:09.811 --> 00:59:12.784
and the reason was,
the women were using abortion

00:59:12.784 --> 00:59:14.829
and were quite happy with it.
 

00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:17.000
They didn't see anything wrong
with it;

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.860
they were used to it,
and no problems,

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:20.170
so why should we change?
 

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:24.239
One of the things that they
did, and we helped them,

00:59:24.239 --> 00:59:27.690
was we got some of these
right-to-life films,

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:31.250
which show, in the goriest way,
what the fetus looks like and

00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.809
what an abortion is like and you
know are really are way,

00:59:34.809 --> 00:59:37.175
way off the deep end and
shipped them to them so they

00:59:37.175 --> 00:59:38.860
could show their patients and
say,

00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:43.719
'see an abortion is not just
this sort of nothing kind of

00:59:43.719 --> 00:59:44.500
event.'
 

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:49.159
The most interesting case might
be Cuba which has one of the

00:59:49.159 --> 00:59:52.239
highest abortion rates in the
world,

00:59:52.239 --> 00:59:57.297
78 per 1,000 women per year,
compared to Canada which has

00:59:57.297 --> 00:59:58.974
15.5,
for instance,

00:59:58.974 --> 01:00:02.570
again that's the two sides of
the United States.

01:00:02.570 --> 01:00:08.090
Almost 60% of what they call
known pregnancies are terminated

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.380
by abortion.
 

01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:10.920
So they have a long history.
 

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.684
Before 1938 they were very much
tied culturally to Spain,

01:00:14.684 --> 01:00:16.969
and Spain was very
conservative.

01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:21.266
That was the Franco era;
a very, very right wing

01:00:21.266 --> 01:00:24.389
fascist, Catholic dictatorship
and so--

01:00:24.389 --> 01:00:26.929
in the Spanish law all forms of
abortion,

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:31.606
induced abortion were illegal,
and Cuba just used that same

01:00:31.606 --> 01:00:32.090
law.
 

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:36.710
It was up until 1938,
and in 1938 they liberalized a

01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:40.880
little bit for rape,
likelihood of death of the

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:45.230
mother, or severe fetal
malformation issues.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:48.971
Despite these restrictions it
was the mechanism of birth

01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:52.713
control in Cuba and it was used
widely by all the social

01:00:52.713 --> 01:00:53.530
classes.
 

01:00:53.530 --> 01:00:55.614
Well, I'll tell you an
exception to that,

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:58.635
and by poor people and it was
used in the cities and in the

01:00:58.635 --> 01:00:59.469
countryside.
 

01:00:59.469 --> 01:01:01.849
So abortion was it.
 

01:01:01.849 --> 01:01:07.141
Contraception starts coming in
but it's a foreign product and

01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:09.666
it's expensive,
and you need some medical

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.952
knowledge to use it,
so only the upper class uses

01:01:12.952 --> 01:01:15.449
contraception,
at this time,

01:01:15.449 --> 01:01:17.800
used contraception in Cuba.
 

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.568
At that time a very,
very--few people owned all the

01:01:20.568 --> 01:01:23.835
sugar plantations and everyone
else was basically a slave on

01:01:23.835 --> 01:01:26.894
the sugar plantations,
so the social gulf between the

01:01:26.894 --> 01:01:29.818
rich people using contraception
and the poor people using

01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:32.949
abortion was enormous and they
didn't talk to each other.

01:01:32.949 --> 01:01:36.927
So there was no social
diffusion of the ideas of

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:40.481
contraception,
so the people just continued

01:01:40.481 --> 01:01:42.090
using abortion.
 

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:47.079
1959 Fidel Castro has his
revolution and he takes over,

01:01:47.079 --> 01:01:51.570
and in the beginning he's
anti-abortion,

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:54.436
he still is,
and a lot of events happened

01:01:54.436 --> 01:01:57.590
and I'm simplifying a
complicated history.

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:00.623
By 1962 the United States
places an embargo on Cuba,

01:02:00.623 --> 01:02:04.074
including medical supplies,
and guess what the Cubans can't

01:02:04.074 --> 01:02:04.550
get?
 

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:07.693
Contraception,
because the United States was

01:02:07.693 --> 01:02:10.911
their source of supply,
so abortion gets more

01:02:10.911 --> 01:02:12.010
entrenched.
 

01:02:12.010 --> 01:02:16.025
The embargo might have done the
biggest thing to raise Cuban

01:02:16.025 --> 01:02:19.876
rates;
no one has good statistics on

01:02:19.876 --> 01:02:20.559
that.
 

01:02:20.559 --> 01:02:25.615
While abortion is legal in
Cuba, the government really

01:02:25.615 --> 01:02:27.619
wants to reduce it.
 

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:31.405
In 1998 the Pope visited Cuba
as you probably may remember

01:02:31.405 --> 01:02:35.190
from all the headlines and he
talked against abortion,

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.925
then, shortly after that,
Castro gave a seven hour

01:02:37.925 --> 01:02:39.449
lecture,
worse than me,

01:02:39.449 --> 01:02:43.353
a seven hour lecture condemning
abortion as a method of birth

01:02:43.353 --> 01:02:44.070
control.
 

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.585
He said it was his duty as a
public figure and a

01:02:47.585 --> 01:02:51.550
revolutionary leader to oppose
widespread abortion.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:54.768
It didn't have any effect on
the people,

01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:58.070
and it's very interesting,
there is now a wonderful

01:02:58.070 --> 01:03:01.831
article which I actually should
have assigned to you about

01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:03.679
what's going on in Cuba.
 

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:06.900
You have too much reading
already.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:11.016
The medical--the government and
the medical establishment want

01:03:11.016 --> 01:03:13.849
to get people--wean people off
abortion.

01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:16.539
In these interviews one of the
things they ask the respondents,

01:03:16.539 --> 01:03:19.929
who are women of all ages and
men of all ages,

01:03:19.929 --> 01:03:23.728
'well what have you heard from
doctors and healthcare

01:03:23.728 --> 01:03:24.969
professionals.'
 

01:03:24.969 --> 01:03:28.679
'Well that's it's dangerous,
that you can die from it.

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:31.068
Just imagine'--that's what
she's heard from the

01:03:31.068 --> 01:03:34.289
professionals--'but just imagine
if you had to give birth every

01:03:34.289 --> 01:03:35.639
time you got pregnant.
 

01:03:35.639 --> 01:03:38.654
I got pregnant and had an
abortion when I was 15 even

01:03:38.654 --> 01:03:40.219
though I was on the pill.
 

01:03:40.219 --> 01:03:43.570
I also got pregnant earlier
when I was using an IUD.'

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:45.835
This was a woman,
who at the time of the

01:03:45.835 --> 01:03:48.797
interview was age 30,
and she had--this is after her

01:03:48.797 --> 01:03:49.960
fourth abortion.
 

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.541
The people's perception is very
different than what they're

01:03:53.541 --> 01:03:56.998
hearing from the medical
establishment and the government

01:03:56.998 --> 01:03:58.110
establishment.
 

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:03.250
It's an absolutely unremarkable
subject for discussion.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:07.186
One male who is now age 49
said, 'I was about ten

01:04:07.186 --> 01:04:12.190
years'--they ask what have
you--do you hear about abortion?

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:13.099
Is it discussed?
 

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:17.559
He says, 'sure,
I was about ten years old,

01:04:17.559 --> 01:04:20.130
I heard about abortion from
people on the street,

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:24.054
also in my house my mom talked
about it with her friends in

01:04:24.054 --> 01:04:25.070
front of me.'
 

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.074
Another respondent:
'Around the streets abortion is

01:04:28.074 --> 01:04:30.179
a common thing people talk
about.

01:04:30.179 --> 01:04:31.389
It's an everyday thing.'
 

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:35.018
A male aged 23.
 

01:04:35.018 --> 01:04:38.789
"Do you know anyone in
your family, among your friends

01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:40.739
who's had an abortion?"
 

01:04:40.739 --> 01:04:42.369
'Yes, an aunt of mine.'
 

01:04:42.369 --> 01:04:43.340
"What did she tell
you?"

01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:45.929
'That you don't feel anything,
that they give you the

01:04:45.929 --> 01:04:48.219
anesthetic and stuff,
everything goes fine.'

01:04:48.219 --> 01:04:52.150
That was a woman of 18 who's
just had her first abortion.

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:54.373
Another respondent,
'yes friends of mine,

01:04:54.373 --> 01:04:57.541
they told me that they had it
done and that you don't feel

01:04:57.541 --> 01:04:58.320
anything.'
 

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.190
Now that was a 15 year old girl
with her first abortion.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:04.440
Another respondent,
'my cousin had an abortion,

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:07.032
she told me that nothing out of
the ordinary happened,

01:05:07.032 --> 01:05:08.550
that everything went well.'
 

01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:11.800
This is a female aged 21 on her
second abortion.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.541
Another respondent,
'when I was in school,

01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:15.030
a friend of mine had an
abortion;

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:18.416
she was fairly young around 13
years old because we were in the

01:05:18.416 --> 01:05:19.289
eighth grade.'
 

01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:21.590
"What did she tell you,
how did it go?"

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:25.177
'She told me it went well and
said the anesthetic was fine,

01:05:25.177 --> 01:05:27.590
girls talk about that kind of
stuff.'

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:33.199
This was a 31 year old woman on
her fourth abortion.

01:05:33.199 --> 01:05:36.228
Another respondent--to the
question, have you heard much

01:05:36.228 --> 01:05:37.440
talk about abortion?
 

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:39.030
'Oh yes, among girls at school.
 

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:41.186
They don't use anything,'
meaning they don't use any

01:05:41.186 --> 01:05:43.090
contraceptives,
'so when they get pregnant the

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:44.190
go to get an abortion.
 

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.139
They talk about it like it's
nothing;

01:05:46.139 --> 01:05:47.929
it's like drinking a glass of
water.

01:05:47.929 --> 01:05:50.958
Some people have problems when
they get an abortion but most

01:05:50.958 --> 01:05:51.730
people don't.
 

01:05:51.730 --> 01:05:54.530
Almost always the procedure
goes fine.'

01:05:54.530 --> 01:05:59.570
That's a 17 year old girl after
her first abortion.

01:05:59.570 --> 01:06:03.496
It's a very interesting case
because while they're

01:06:03.496 --> 01:06:05.625
experienced,
they're hearing one thing from

01:06:05.625 --> 01:06:07.403
the government,
the same thing from the medical

01:06:07.403 --> 01:06:09.793
community but they know lots and
lots of people who have had

01:06:09.793 --> 01:06:11.137
abortions,
a common subject,

01:06:11.137 --> 01:06:13.750
and they're not hearing about
any difficulties from it,

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.559
or very rarely are they.
 

01:06:15.559 --> 01:06:18.766
The government's pushing
contraception and they use

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:21.394
contraception,
92% of the Cuban women have

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.869
used contraception.
 

01:06:22.869 --> 01:06:26.835
That's some time--even among
adolescent girls who are

01:06:26.835 --> 01:06:31.411
obviously having a very rich sex
life because they're getting

01:06:31.411 --> 01:06:36.525
pregnant all the time,
84% have used some form of

01:06:36.525 --> 01:06:38.289
contraception.
 

01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:41.413
It doesn't mean anything to
them, because they're just as

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:42.639
happy with abortion.
 

01:06:42.639 --> 01:06:45.478
So, they're not worried about
getting pregnant so they

01:06:45.478 --> 01:06:48.411
sometimes use contraception,
they sometimes don't,

01:06:48.411 --> 01:06:51.621
and the reports of when they
use it are almost totally

01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:52.409
haphazard.
 

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:54.601
They'll use it for a while,
they'll stop using it,

01:06:54.601 --> 01:06:56.659
they'll start again and they
change methods.

01:06:56.659 --> 01:07:00.925
It doesn't even have any--of
course women go through periods

01:07:00.925 --> 01:07:03.494
and men too,
when they're in a relationship

01:07:03.494 --> 01:07:05.869
having sex or just having a lot
of casual sex,

01:07:05.869 --> 01:07:08.608
and the woman will tell you
this and the use of

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:12.121
contraception did not correlate
at all with periods when the

01:07:12.121 --> 01:07:13.670
women were having sex.
 

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:17.293
It's just a total disconnect
and undoubtedly the reason is

01:07:17.293 --> 01:07:20.916
that they're perfectly happy
with abortion and it's a fine

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:24.668
backup so they don't have to be
terribly careful about using

01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:25.940
contraception.
 

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:32.007
In fact, much as they're
hearing that abortion is no big

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:34.918
deal,
they're hearing that the other

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:38.909
forms of other contraception are
really not very pleasant.

01:07:38.909 --> 01:07:41.730
Here are more answers to survey
questions.

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:45.655
'I don't like the pill because
of extra hormones in the woman's

01:07:45.655 --> 01:07:47.809
body,' a male aged 19 says that.
 

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:50.983
This is a woman:
'No, I don't use any IUD

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:53.760
because my body can't support
it.

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.210
It falls out of place.'
 

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.590
"You have used an IUD in
the past?"

01:07:57.590 --> 01:08:00.766
'Yes, I had an IUD two
different times and both times

01:08:00.766 --> 01:08:01.989
it fell out place.
 

01:08:01.989 --> 01:08:03.869
I have problems with IUDs.'
 

01:08:03.869 --> 01:08:08.409
That's a 37 year old woman on
her second abortion.

01:08:08.409 --> 01:08:11.719
IUD causes pain to women.
 

01:08:11.719 --> 01:08:14.423
'After my first pregnancy I had
an IUD inserted,

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:17.819
but I had to have it removed
because it was causing pain.

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:21.337
I started having problems with
my period and a lot of

01:08:21.337 --> 01:08:24.154
inflammation,
and when I had sex it was

01:08:24.154 --> 01:08:27.831
painful, so I had the IUD
removed,' female aged 35 her

01:08:27.831 --> 01:08:29.078
first abortion.
 

01:08:29.078 --> 01:08:32.292
'I had an IUD before,
I had it for two years,

01:08:32.292 --> 01:08:36.091
but I had it removed because I
had abnormal menstrual

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:39.890
bleeding,' a 42 year old woman,
fourth abortion.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.463
Another woman,
'sometimes I'll use protection

01:08:42.463 --> 01:08:43.810
but the condom broke.
 

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.131
You explain these things to the
doctors and they say that--this

01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:49.920
doesn't happen but I'm telling
you it's not a lie.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:53.948
Sometimes condoms are bad and
they break,' a 19 year old girl

01:08:53.948 --> 01:08:55.560
on her third abortion.
 

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:04.586
At the time of the survey 88%
were practicing contraception at

01:09:04.586 --> 01:09:07.752
the time of the survey,
and again, among adolescents

01:09:07.752 --> 01:09:10.420
68% were using condoms at the
time of the survey.

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:13.743
Yet, the contraception,
they didn't like it,

01:09:13.743 --> 01:09:17.532
it wasn't effective,
and they were apparently just

01:09:17.532 --> 01:09:19.619
as happy with abortion.
 

01:09:27.908 --> 01:09:31.382
It's a very interesting thing
and this is repeated in

01:09:31.382 --> 01:09:34.590
basically all of the east
European countries,

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:37.456
where again,
they have long experience with

01:09:37.456 --> 01:09:41.140
abortion and they don't
particularly see any benefit to

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:42.368
contraception.
 

01:09:42.368 --> 01:09:46.036
Now the standard thing that
you'll hear in America from

01:09:46.036 --> 01:09:49.907
everybody, independent of
their--they can be right to life

01:09:49.907 --> 01:09:51.130
or pro-choice.
 

01:09:51.130 --> 01:09:55.382
Their thing is that--the idea
is, and I've been sort of saying

01:09:55.382 --> 01:09:58.340
that here,
the idea is to replace abortion

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.815
with contraception,
that contraception is a better

01:10:01.815 --> 01:10:04.529
method of birth control than
abortion.

01:10:04.529 --> 01:10:07.899
It's controversial--but now
it's controversial.

01:10:07.899 --> 01:10:10.497
Actually, what started me
really looking into this was a

01:10:10.497 --> 01:10:12.670
number of years ago I was giving
a lecture,

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:16.421
and I was saying very overtly,
that well it's progress when

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.618
contraception replaces abortion.
 

01:10:18.618 --> 01:10:26.235
Now it's not so obvious because
I showed you this one,

01:10:26.235 --> 01:10:34.140
that the safest method is
condoms backed by abortion.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:37.971
It's very--it was very
hard--one student asked me this

01:10:37.971 --> 01:10:40.869
question about why is--
why do you think that

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:43.779
contraception is better than
abortion and it's a very,

01:10:43.779 --> 01:10:48.525
very hard question to answer
and I won't even try to do this

01:10:48.525 --> 01:10:49.170
today.
 

01:10:49.170 --> 01:10:52.350
It's a very difficult kind of
issue.

01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:56.065
The final thing that I should
tell you is that one of the

01:10:56.065 --> 01:10:59.649
things we worry about is the
population growth rate.

01:10:59.649 --> 01:11:03.643
Abortion makes a huge
difference in the global rate of

01:11:03.643 --> 01:11:05.149
population growth.
 

01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:08.822
As I told you,
there's ballpark 75 million

01:11:08.822 --> 01:11:11.328
increase in the world now.
 

01:11:11.328 --> 01:11:16.381
If the abortion rate is about
somewhere between 40 and 50

01:11:16.381 --> 01:11:21.884
million, that means the rate of
world population increase goes

01:11:21.884 --> 01:11:24.319
up by 75% or something.
 

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:27.859
Because abortion is such a
large fraction of the birthrate,

01:11:27.859 --> 01:11:31.069
if abortion disappears and is
not replaced by contraception,

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:34.408
the population growth rate goes
crazy.

01:11:34.408 --> 01:11:37.060
In the world,
as it is now,

01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:43.378
there's probably not any chance
of stabilizing world population

01:11:43.378 --> 01:11:45.520
without abortion.
 

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:48.930
Just on time,
we will continue with the

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:54.318
biology of abortion and some of
the history and philosophical

01:11:54.318 --> 01:11:57.819
considerations in the next
lecture.

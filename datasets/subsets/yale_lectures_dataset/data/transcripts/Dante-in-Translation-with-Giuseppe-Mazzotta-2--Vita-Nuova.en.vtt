00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.770
Prof: Today we'll be
discussing,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.720
and a little bit in haste of
course,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.320
because I haven't got much time
to do this,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.445
but we'll devote the whole
class to the Vita nova or

00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.685
nuova,
as it is called which is

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:20.040
Dante's first work.
 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.325
I was going to say "first
finished work,"

00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:26.020
but in a way,
it's not a finished work.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.940
It is a deliberately unfinished
work.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.310
Dante doesn't really finish
many of his works.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.430
He interrupts them;
he breaks off and decides to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.350
move on to do other things.
 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.921
This is the case with the
philosophical Banquet,

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:43.558
this text of ethics that he
goes on writing once he's in

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:44.220
exile.
 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.682
It's true for the text on
language, the so-called De

00:00:47.682 --> 00:00:50.823
vulgari eloquentia,
about the vulgar language,

00:00:50.823 --> 00:00:53.260
a second book he just won't go
on.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.222
But it's also true,
in a way, for the Vita

00:00:56.222 --> 00:01:00.261
nuova to know that ends with
a vision, but we do not know

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:02.820
what's going to happen after
that.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.391
This is--there is a kind of
suspension about it,

00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:07.634
but this is the first work,
let's call it,

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:09.438
full work, that Dante writes.
 

00:01:09.438 --> 00:01:13.188
The title means a "new
life";

00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:18.159
though new or new life,
so it means probably youth;

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.924
that describes the story,
an autobiographical account,

00:01:23.924 --> 00:01:29.799
the lover, the poet who falls
in love with Beatrice.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.265
You may remember I called it
the first decisive event

00:01:33.265 --> 00:01:37.063
happening in his early life
immediately after his mother's

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:41.263
death and describes the story of
this love for Beatrice who then

00:01:41.263 --> 00:01:43.129
in the narrative dies.
 

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.673
And he goes--he,
the pilgrim,

00:01:45.673 --> 00:01:48.671
lover, poet,
goes on recording the

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:53.849
confusion, the sense of loss
that ensues this event of the

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:56.030
death of Beatrice.
 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.239
His betrayals become an ethical
drama,

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:04.090
as most lyrical poetry of the
Middle Ages does,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.180
they're always dealing with
treacherous presences,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.177
with betrayals,
with infidelity,

00:02:11.177 --> 00:02:14.682
etc.,
and then he ends up having a

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:15.919
final vision.
 

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:20.229
So it's youth,
it's the new life meets,

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.284
above all youth,
but youth means many other

00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:26.848
things which I think the
narrative will go on--

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:29.379
the meanings of which I think
the narrative will sustain.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.884
"New," in Italian,
means surprising,

00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:37.200
unexpected, even strange,
novel, marvelous,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.339
it's--and it therefore gives a
kind of direction to the way we

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.949
should be reading the story.
 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:49.021
Its primarily,
well all of these meanings are

00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:53.081
true and it's an autobiography,
or what do we call,

00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:55.099
or we'll come to the
description of what an

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.129
autobiography is,
it's also what we call a novel

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.438
of the self.
 

00:03:00.438 --> 00:03:03.705
Another way of speaking about
autobiography which literally

00:03:03.705 --> 00:03:05.340
means I write about myself.
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.641
So let me say a few things
about this structure,

00:03:08.641 --> 00:03:12.366
this autobiographical
structure, this form of problems

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:15.530
before we get into the narrative
as such.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.714
From one point of view we might
all agree easily that if you

00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:24.167
knew that this is--
it belongs--the Vita

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:28.220
nuova belongs to the mode of
Provençal poets,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.376
who would all write what they
would call,

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:32.210
"vida"
-- life.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.961
It's just a word that lingers,
continues in Spanish,

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.360
"life."
 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.465
So they would write their poems
and they would append a brief

00:03:40.465 --> 00:03:41.758
account of their lives.
 

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:44.162
This is true for Jaufré
Rudel, they all would do that

00:03:44.162 --> 00:03:45.710
when they would publish their
poems.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.286
So let's say that Dante is
writing about himself,

00:03:49.286 --> 00:03:54.128
and inserting the poems as part
of the texture of his own life.

00:03:54.128 --> 00:03:57.952
As an autobiography,
though, the text echoes,

00:03:57.952 --> 00:04:01.080
and is modeled on,
the most important

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.990
autobiography written in the
Middle Ages.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.854
In fact, it's written by one
who can be called the founder of

00:04:08.854 --> 00:04:11.366
the autobiographical genre and
it is St.

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:15.360
Augustine, who writes as you
know, the Confessions.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.600
A confession,
which is a witnessing,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.870
which is--it's really the story
of his life,

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.535
from his childhood in Africa,
his growing up as a gifted

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:33.129
young rhetorician,
philosopher turned rhetorician,

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.166
who then moves to Rome where he
becomes a teacher despised and

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:41.339
paid by his students,
moves on to Milan and the whole

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:44.430
narrative climaxes with a
conversion.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.678
In fact, the whole idea of an
autobiography for Augustine is

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:52.134
that it is--it coincides with,
it is coextensive,

00:04:52.134 --> 00:04:53.720
with a conversion.
 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.500
He writes--he achieves this
conversion in a garden in Milan,

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.971
it's a narrative that we may
have at some point a chance to

00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:07.521
go to and look at it in some
detail and then goes on writing

00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:12.226
a hermeneutics of the biblical
Genesis as if the new life that

00:05:12.226 --> 00:05:15.074
he found,
through the conversion,

00:05:15.074 --> 00:05:18.795
could only literally issue into
a commentary about all

00:05:18.795 --> 00:05:22.276
beginnings;
Genesis is the beginning of all

00:05:22.276 --> 00:05:24.129
beginnings as it were.
 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.577
After we say this and we
say--and I can say that

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:31.391
Augustine writes in the full
awareness that in effect

00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:35.865
autobiography has to be the same
thing as a conversion because

00:05:35.865 --> 00:05:39.680
autobiography demands two voices
all the time.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.646
It's necessarily ambivalent;
it demands the voice of the

00:05:45.646 --> 00:05:50.577
narrator who is outside of the
narrative and who can look

00:05:50.577 --> 00:05:53.148
back--
in fact the mode of writing

00:05:53.148 --> 00:05:55.850
autobiographies is always
retrospection.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.091
I look back at my life and try
to figure out what are the

00:06:00.091 --> 00:06:04.334
stages, what are the events,
what is it that makes me now

00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:06.230
the person that I am.
 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.408
There's a sort of necessary
distance between the protagonist

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:14.129
and the narrator,
two voices.

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.750
A narrator who knows more than
what the protagonist knew.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.230
I am caught in time and I have
encounters in my own life from

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.581
day to day,
and I never know what those

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:32.430
encounters really portend,
nor what do they mean and that

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.230
same thing for you.
 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:38.267
You have--you probably--I don't
know if you hold that which is a

00:06:38.267 --> 00:06:42.254
most abbreviated--
a unit of an autobiography

00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:45.810
which is a diary,
you go home at night and you

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.240
jot down all the great events of
the day,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.500
but you may overlook the most
important.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.680
You may have had a meeting with
someone,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.720
you may have caught sight of
some person,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.771
who eventually ten years from
now will reenter your life and

00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:03.891
give an altogether different
appearance and direction to your

00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:04.509
life.
 

00:07:04.509 --> 00:07:08.168
This is to say,
that all autobiographical

00:07:08.168 --> 00:07:11.569
experiments,
like all diary entries,

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.425
are always uncertain and
fundamentally false because you

00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:20.290
can never really write--
you can only write about what

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.456
you know at that point and you
can never really write about the

00:07:23.456 --> 00:07:25.089
whole structure of your life.
 

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:29.303
To be able to write about the
structure of your life you have

00:07:29.303 --> 00:07:33.870
to die, that's Augustine's idea
of the necessity of conversion.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.004
It's a symbolic death by means
of which you come back into

00:07:37.004 --> 00:07:39.834
existence,
you come back into life as a

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.036
new man,
you have a new life,

00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:46.451
and now from that standpoint of
yours being a new life you can

00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:50.286
have all the necessary
detachment to look at your past

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:53.470
and decipher that which was in a
haze,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.089
that which was uncertain as
things went on.

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:59.408
The other reason why you need
this kind of structure in

00:07:59.408 --> 00:08:01.497
autobiographies,
this double voice,

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:02.420
is obvious.
 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.338
Because if I go on writing
about my life without any sense

00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:08.259
of what my life is about,
can you imagine what happens?

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:10.911
I go on writing every single
thing that I do which means that

00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:13.694
I would need another life to be
able to say well I got up in the

00:08:13.694 --> 00:08:15.401
morning,
then I brushed my teeth,

00:08:15.401 --> 00:08:15.920
etc., etc.
 

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.031
It becomes a random,
senseless, accumulation of

00:08:21.031 --> 00:08:26.810
facts without any particular
meaning or direction.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:34.860
Dante is aware of this type of
complication of autobiographies.

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.340
We don't have this kind of
autobiographies,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.220
you have autobiographical
writings beforehand,

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:45.960
you have a kind of self
analysis, think of the one--

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.700
the figure that is most
powerful for Augustine is David,

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.240
King David and his Psalms with
a kind of reflection,

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.589
a kind of turning inward,
and trying to pinpoint the

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:02.604
shifts in moods,
moral judgments,

00:09:02.604 --> 00:09:06.090
temptations,
the idea of one's own system

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.995
is,
but this really means a kind of

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:11.288
internalization of one's life.
 

00:09:11.288 --> 00:09:15.715
Augustine will not do this,
Augustine will go into the

00:09:15.715 --> 00:09:19.363
interiority of his self,
into the interiority of his

00:09:19.363 --> 00:09:22.217
consciousness,
but he will also describe what

00:09:22.217 --> 00:09:24.990
has happened to him in the
public space.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.879
Now he goes inside and outside
all the time.

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:31.690
Dante's, Vita nuova,
you have all read it,

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.210
it's really a complicated text
from this point of view,

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:39.070
because for it being an
autobiography,

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:43.061
it's amazing how little he
tells us really about his own

00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:43.570
life.
 

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.259
There's nothing concrete about
this text.

00:09:46.259 --> 00:09:51.345
We know that it has taken place
in--it takes place in Florence,

00:09:51.345 --> 00:09:55.200
but Florence is not even
mentioned as a city.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.236
We only infer that it's
Florence because at one point

00:09:58.236 --> 00:10:01.448
there is a description of a
river that crosses by it and

00:10:01.448 --> 00:10:04.720
which Dante uses because he has
had an inspiration,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.427
words come to him with the same
kind of strength and naturalness

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.960
with which the waters of the
river flow,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:14.695
that's the implied meaning of
that association or description

00:10:14.695 --> 00:10:17.863
of the landscape,
there's a river and fantastic

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:22.240
words came to me which I jotted
down which I wanted to remember,

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:24.759
it's the turning in point in
poetic terms of the Vita

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:25.308
nuova.
 

00:10:25.308 --> 00:10:28.128
When he addresses the -- he
understands that to write poetry

00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:30.207
--
he writes the famous line,

00:10:30.207 --> 00:10:33.548
"Women who have intellect
of love."

00:10:33.548 --> 00:10:36.279
It is a remarkable line,
Donne ch'avete

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:39.474
intelletto, it's a
remarkable line and I will

00:10:39.474 --> 00:10:42.070
explain why it's a remarkable
line.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.179
It was never written -- that
kind of perception was never

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:49.777
really part of the
understanding--of the warehouse

00:10:49.777 --> 00:10:51.980
of the poetic imagination.
 

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.899
What does Dante do?
 

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:56.110
It's a little bit abstract.
 

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:59.710
It's a kind of an enigmatic
account that he gives and this

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.100
is unlike Augustine.
 

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:06.190
It begins with a reference to
the book of memory.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:11.350
In that part of the book of my
memory,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.090
within which little has been
written,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.558
I find words which I cannot go
on repeating and all,

00:11:18.558 --> 00:11:21.048
but I would just transcribe
some sentences,

00:11:21.048 --> 00:11:24.239
the meanings of them,
so he understands that here we

00:11:24.239 --> 00:11:25.294
have,
first of all,

00:11:25.294 --> 00:11:27.534
it's a book of memory,
not necessarily an act of

00:11:27.534 --> 00:11:30.500
retrospection and memory it has
a number of other implications

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.230
and dangers.
 

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.570
What are the implications?
 

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:38.240
Well, Dante is writing this,
he's about 25,24;

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.607
it's a provisional
retrospection of his growth as a

00:11:44.607 --> 00:11:45.500
poet.
 

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:48.149
He certainly knows that
memories of the mother,

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:50.972
as you know of the Muses,
this is the famous myth,

00:11:50.972 --> 00:11:51.548
right?
 

00:11:51.548 --> 00:11:55.779
There's the old Greek myth that
memory,

00:11:55.779 --> 00:12:01.163
Mnemosyne, lay with Jupiter for
nine successive nights and from

00:12:01.163 --> 00:12:05.678
their copulations the nine muses
came into being,

00:12:05.678 --> 00:12:08.100
so Memories,
the Mother, which means that

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.801
art is always an act of memory;
a way of remembering,

00:12:11.801 --> 00:12:14.798
an act of remembrance,
we could say.

00:12:14.798 --> 00:12:20.373
It has also some dangers that
Dante will go on reflecting

00:12:20.373 --> 00:12:21.168
about.
 

00:12:21.168 --> 00:12:27.243
It's that if you go on getting
caught in the activity of memory

00:12:27.243 --> 00:12:31.889
you run a serious risk,
the risk of changing your sense

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:35.548
of life and your sense of
reality into the phantasms of

00:12:35.548 --> 00:12:38.259
memory because that's what
memory is.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:40.288
It's called,
as you know,

00:12:40.288 --> 00:12:42.740
the eye of the imagination.
 

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.730
That's the famous description
of memory.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.751
The Greeks, of course,
used to put memory in the

00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:53.676
heart, and in fact as you know,
the ancient Greeks used to put

00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:55.220
memory in the heart.
 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.288
In fact, as you know,
in Italian we still do say--

00:12:57.288 --> 00:12:59.243
or in Spanish,
recordarse,

00:12:59.243 --> 00:13:02.457
which really has the etymology,
in English record,

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:05.428
that's the etymology of the
heart we remember.

00:13:05.428 --> 00:13:08.600
But in the Middle Ages it's
already part of the imagination;

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.039
it's called the eye of the
imagination which means that it

00:13:13.039 --> 00:13:15.690
has a visionary component to it.
 

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.202
This explains the emphasis of
dreams, vision,

00:13:19.202 --> 00:13:24.153
strange apparitions with which
this text is punctuated from the

00:13:24.153 --> 00:13:26.149
beginning to the end.
 

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:29.500
Dante, I repeat,
understands that there is a

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.333
danger to memory and the danger
of memory is the transformation

00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:37.919
of experience into a
phantasmatic reality;

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:39.340
the whole living in the world.
 

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.587
It's like you're always looking
backwards and you're not

00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:46.095
Janus-like,
you don't look in all

00:13:46.095 --> 00:13:50.101
directions, you don't look ahead
and Dante will turn against

00:13:50.101 --> 00:13:50.779
memory.
 

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:53.500
The second thing that we get
from that little exordium of--

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.000
in that part of the book of my
memory,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.668
we know that Dante's placed
himself--

00:13:57.668 --> 00:14:02.259
I find words which have been
the inscriptions of memory,

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:05.820
I'm not going to repeat them
all, but only some of them.

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.072
We know that Dante has casted
himself as the editor of his own

00:14:09.072 --> 00:14:10.778
book, that's the double poise.
 

00:14:10.778 --> 00:14:14.850
This is the double structure of
this little text of his.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.854
First of all it's a double--
has duplicity all over,

00:14:18.854 --> 00:14:22.308
this text has,
it's a book of poetry and it's

00:14:22.308 --> 00:14:23.879
a book of prose.
 

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:27.139
It's not an unusual structure:
Boethius, The

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:30.751
Consolation of
Philosophy is written like

00:14:30.751 --> 00:14:31.389
that.
 

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:35.245
Dante also writes other texts
like that, but what are the

00:14:35.245 --> 00:14:36.279
implications?
 

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:41.279
Well, there's a lyrical self
who has been in the throes of a

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:45.942
great passion for Beatrice,
who struggles sometimes with

00:14:45.942 --> 00:14:48.570
his inspiration,
who waits.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.230
And that's the problem he has,
that one of the crises that he

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.889
has is that he's always waiting
for words to come to him,

00:14:55.889 --> 00:14:59.740
he's always waiting for
Beatrice to say hello to him,

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.639
there is a way in which he
casts himself as the passive,

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:06.668
a passive protagonist,
weak-willed,

00:15:06.668 --> 00:15:11.691
unable, believing that the will
can direct him wherever the will

00:15:11.691 --> 00:15:16.792
wants and that's another problem
that we are really going to talk

00:15:16.792 --> 00:15:17.590
about.
 

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:24.927
Then, finally he understands
that he better get out of that

00:15:24.927 --> 00:15:26.985
mode,
and in effect,

00:15:26.985 --> 00:15:30.048
and I will say this by making
you turn,

00:15:30.048 --> 00:15:31.850
just talking about the formal
structure now,

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.928
the whole text is written in
the past mode,

00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:39.070
the whole text in that part of
the book of memory;

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.572
a commemoration of a great
event in the private life of

00:15:44.572 --> 00:15:47.533
Dante,
the love which he doesn't even

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:50.506
know what it is,
he doesn't even know the woman,

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:53.890
he doesn't even know what the
passion is and part of what the

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.990
tension of this text is,
to ponder what it is that the

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.980
passion means and what it is
that it's doing to him and to

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.610
his mind.
 

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:03.610
But by the end of the--in
Chapter XLII,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.004
which by the way,
let it be said in passing,

00:16:07.004 --> 00:16:11.110
its division in numbers is
completely arbitrary.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.059
We don't know,
that's not the way books were

00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.493
written,
codices were written in Dante's

00:16:15.493 --> 00:16:17.750
time,
it was a continuous -- to say

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.446
page something,
page something,

00:16:19.446 --> 00:16:22.215
people really believe,
but the modern editors have

00:16:22.215 --> 00:16:24.570
made it controversially into
XLII,

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.960
so this should be XXX,
and I agree with that.

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.798
Let me read the last passage,
the last paragraph which is not

00:16:30.798 --> 00:16:32.720
poetry now, ends with prose.
 

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.544
With a voice of reflection
prose functions as the work of

00:16:37.544 --> 00:16:41.250
reflections on the lyrical
inspirations,

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.409
on the immediacy of the lyrical
voice,

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:44.548
so that's the double voice.
 

00:16:44.548 --> 00:16:47.538
I'm an editor and I'm a poet at
the same time;

00:16:47.538 --> 00:16:50.038
sometimes the editing,
the notes that he writes,

00:16:50.038 --> 00:16:51.580
say nothing about the poem.
 

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.299
They try to--sometimes he goes
on into formal mechanical

00:16:55.299 --> 00:16:58.879
description about love,
this sonnet is divided into two

00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:01.312
parts,
that doesn't really add much to

00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:03.673
the inner life,
to our understanding of the

00:17:03.673 --> 00:17:05.150
inner life of the protagonist.
 

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.308
This is what he says in XLII,
Chapter XLII,

00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:11.236
"After I wrote this
sonnet,"

00:17:11.236 --> 00:17:15.507
which is about the famous
vision of Beatrice sitting at

00:17:15.507 --> 00:17:19.702
the foot of God's throne,
and so he decides that he has

00:17:19.702 --> 00:17:20.519
to go there.
 

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.980
He decides that he has to go
and meet her,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.480
that's the last vision.
 

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:29.432
"After I wrote this sonnet
there came to me a miraculous

00:17:29.432 --> 00:17:32.238
vision in which I saw
things,"

00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:37.355
like a visionary burden of the
narrative is kept up from memory

00:17:37.355 --> 00:17:41.060
now to vision,
"that made me resolve to

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.509
say no more about this blessed
one.

00:17:43.509 --> 00:17:45.750
"Blessed"
in Italian, by the way is a pun

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.269
on the name of Beatrice,
the one who is blessed,

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:50.548
the one who is the bearer of
the good,

00:17:50.548 --> 00:17:53.180
now that's really what it
means--;"...

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.374
until I will be capable of
writing about her in a nobler

00:17:57.374 --> 00:17:58.288
way."
 

00:17:58.288 --> 00:18:02.525
That's the unavoidably
unfinished quality of the text,

00:18:02.525 --> 00:18:07.240
I can't go on to write about
her, I need to do more work.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:10.041
I need to do more research and
find out what I really can say

00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:10.930
about this woman.
 

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.269
So he will stop.
 

00:18:12.269 --> 00:18:16.276
That's what I call an
unfinished, an inevitably

00:18:16.276 --> 00:18:18.278
unfinished narrative.
 

00:18:18.278 --> 00:18:22.855
"To achieve this I'm
striving as hard as I can,

00:18:22.855 --> 00:18:25.278
and this she truly knows.
 

00:18:25.278 --> 00:18:28.267
Accordingly,
if it be the pleasure of Him

00:18:28.267 --> 00:18:32.673
through whom all things live
that my life continue for a few

00:18:32.673 --> 00:18:36.221
more years,
I hope to write of her that

00:18:36.221 --> 00:18:41.098
which has never been written
before of any other woman.

00:18:41.098 --> 00:18:44.590
And that it may please the One
who is the Lord of graciousness

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.740
that my soul ascend to behold
the glory of its lady,

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.498
that is, of that blessed
Beatrice who in glory

00:18:50.498 --> 00:18:54.115
contemplates the countenance of
the One qui est per omnia

00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:56.200
secula benedictus"
--

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:01.349
and to all times blessed,
and ends with a pun on,

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:03.200
again, on Beatrice.
 

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.298
What is the most important--to
me the most important point of

00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:11.953
this paragraph,
the intrusion of the verb of

00:19:11.953 --> 00:19:13.230
the future.
 

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.548
The only time you find it in
the narrative,

00:19:15.548 --> 00:19:16.710
"I hope."
 

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:22.098
The whole text is contained
between an exercise of memory,

00:19:22.098 --> 00:19:24.450
an idea of something which is
past,

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.307
and that tempts him greatly
because if something is past and

00:19:27.307 --> 00:19:28.882
you have--
you think that you can even

00:19:28.882 --> 00:19:31.711
control it,
you can certainly decipher it,

00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:36.259
you can hope to extract from it
some particular meaning,

00:19:36.259 --> 00:19:40.047
complacently or not,
and then ends with a projection

00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:44.759
of the self into the future,
another work is to come.

00:19:44.759 --> 00:19:48.652
This is the preamble to
something more which I cannot

00:19:48.652 --> 00:19:51.575
really contain,
so memory is abandoned,

00:19:51.575 --> 00:19:56.373
the work ends with an image,
and within the horizon of the

00:19:56.373 --> 00:19:57.130
future.
 

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.098
This is really very important.
 

00:19:59.098 --> 00:20:02.544
The limitations of memory
are--can be understood only from

00:20:02.544 --> 00:20:05.240
this point of view because hope,
as you know,

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.575
when you think of hope,
hope grammatically--this is

00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:10.150
what is the future.
 

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:13.276
He says I hope to write,
there's no future there,

00:20:13.276 --> 00:20:15.098
I hope that's the present.
 

00:20:15.098 --> 00:20:19.601
But hope grammatically is a
verb, those of you who have

00:20:19.601 --> 00:20:24.185
studied a little bit of Latin,
remember, always take the

00:20:24.185 --> 00:20:26.019
future participle.
 

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:29.519
I hope that I will do this;
I hope I would have done this;

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.358
it doesn't work.
 

00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:33.550
I wished I had done that,
but so it takes all--it's a

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:34.838
verb of the future.
 

00:20:34.838 --> 00:20:37.976
It is literally also in
substantial terms,

00:20:37.976 --> 00:20:39.200
it's a virtue.
 

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.554
This is a--to say "I
hope" is a theological

00:20:43.554 --> 00:20:47.490
virtue, hope which always
implies the future.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:52.711
It says that the past is not
really over and done with

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:57.740
because once you include,
or you intrude the category of

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.237
hope,
you really believe you can

00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:02.660
change the meaning of the past.
 

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:05.832
That things may be happening
that whereby all your past

00:21:05.832 --> 00:21:08.787
errors,
all your past mistakes can be

00:21:08.787 --> 00:21:11.890
seen and will be seen in a new
life,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:16.058
so much then for this question
of destruction.

00:21:16.058 --> 00:21:19.390
I repeat, we have prose and
poetry,

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.997
we have the voice of the lover,
and we have the voice of the

00:21:21.997 --> 00:21:24.642
editor,
we have a text of memory that

00:21:24.642 --> 00:21:27.680
at the same time turns against
itself,

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.180
points out the limitations of
memory,

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.130
and opens to the future through
hope,

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:38.013
and you have this idea that
something amazing is going to

00:21:38.013 --> 00:21:38.960
happen.
 

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.828
Something that,
though nothing concrete is

00:21:41.828 --> 00:21:45.890
being given, everything will
take place within the self.

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:50.140
It's the moment where Dante
abandons Augustine.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:53.239
We began by saying,
I began by saying that the

00:21:53.239 --> 00:21:55.654
mode,
the rhetorical mode that Dante

00:21:55.654 --> 00:21:59.260
really follows is Augustine's
Confessions which is a

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:03.240
text of retrospection and ends
with a commentary of Genesis,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:08.259
Dante ends with what we call a
prolepsis,

00:22:08.259 --> 00:22:11.170
a weird word that's not so
weird, but all that means,

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:15.183
a projection to the future;
autobiography has this kind of

00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:18.650
future dimension and cannot be
contained.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:22.170
In other words,
it's not over and done with.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.969
The mode which,
just to make this really

00:22:24.969 --> 00:22:28.691
intelligible to you,
the kind of text that is most

00:22:28.691 --> 00:22:33.049
like what Dante has written in
the Vita nuova is really

00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:37.050
Joyce who writes The Portrait
of the Artist as a Young

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:37.980
Man.
 

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.799
That's the way you can
really--if you cannot have a

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.575
conversion,
if you cannot die as Augustine

00:22:44.575 --> 00:22:46.680
says you have to do when you
write,

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.726
write an autobiography,
in order to come back as a new

00:22:49.726 --> 00:22:52.944
man and be able to write your
life story and find out the

00:22:52.944 --> 00:22:56.825
meaning of your life,
then what you can do is write

00:22:56.825 --> 00:23:01.267
about yourself with a kind of
temporal distance that is

00:23:01.267 --> 00:23:02.828
brought by time.
 

00:23:02.828 --> 00:23:06.294
I'm no longer the young man I
used to be, but I do know those

00:23:06.294 --> 00:23:06.930
passions.
 

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.228
I remove myself from them in
exactly the same way Joyce does

00:23:10.228 --> 00:23:13.637
it with The Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man which

00:23:13.637 --> 00:23:16.210
ends with the projection of
going to the--

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.348
descending into the smithy of
this whole and writing,

00:23:19.348 --> 00:23:26.930
and then forge the epic of the
future.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:32.115
That's really the--it ends with
a project for the future so this

00:23:32.115 --> 00:23:36.314
is a kind of a mode of
autobiographical writing that

00:23:36.314 --> 00:23:39.690
Dante really prepares and puts
forth.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:43.848
What happens in this text,
so much for the--

00:23:43.848 --> 00:23:47.406
this--you--by the way you can
stop me at any point as I'm

00:23:47.406 --> 00:23:51.028
talking if you want me to
clarify things or we can leave a

00:23:51.028 --> 00:23:52.680
little bit at the end.
 

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:53.910
What happens in the text?
 

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.460
It's a love story.
 

00:23:56.460 --> 00:24:06.308
It's a love story of a young
man who meets,

00:24:06.308 --> 00:24:10.373
at the age of nine,
meets a young woman who is

00:24:10.373 --> 00:24:14.537
roughly the same age,
he says she's in her ninth

00:24:14.537 --> 00:24:19.298
year, doesn't even know who she
is but feels a kind of bliss.

00:24:19.298 --> 00:24:22.432
Then he sees her again nine
years later, so we know that

00:24:22.432 --> 00:24:25.680
there is a kind of numerical
symbolism running through.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.598
The number for Beatrice is
three, 333,

00:24:29.598 --> 00:24:32.573
a Trinitarian number,
she comes-- she reappears and

00:24:32.573 --> 00:24:36.259
is convinced that this is going
to be the love of his life,

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:39.200
but he doesn't even know what
love is.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.608
He does not know what love is,
what he does know at the

00:24:42.608 --> 00:24:44.938
beginning,
and this is what part of the

00:24:44.938 --> 00:24:47.941
whole--
the economy of this narrative

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:52.640
really focuses on trying to
ponder what love may be.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:56.984
The culture of the Middle Ages
is filled with literature of

00:24:56.984 --> 00:24:57.509
love.
 

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:00.230
This could be viewed as one of
the many love books of the

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.140
Middle Ages,
and in case some of you may be

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.410
looking already for a topic for
your paper,

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.338
you could write about the love
books of the Middle Ages.

00:25:08.338 --> 00:25:11.573
What are the other love books,
the famous love books of the

00:25:11.573 --> 00:25:13.751
Middle Ages,
which are completely different

00:25:13.751 --> 00:25:16.170
from the love books of the
Middle Ages coming before.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.983
For instance,
The Art of Courtly Love

00:25:18.983 --> 00:25:22.321
of Andreas Capellanus,
which is as some of you know,

00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:24.940
it's a codification of what
love is.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:28.920
The idea that love is an art,
the "art of courtly

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:33.425
love," that it's obviously
natural instinct or thrust or

00:25:33.425 --> 00:25:37.406
passion and yet has to be
changed as if there can be a

00:25:37.406 --> 00:25:39.509
sentimental education.
 

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:43.759
One has to learn how to
contain, how to hold off

00:25:43.759 --> 00:25:48.644
excesses, how to hold off the
potential disruptions and

00:25:48.644 --> 00:25:51.900
violence that love will commute.
 

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:54.528
There are the romances of
Chrétien de Troyes that

00:25:54.528 --> 00:25:57.828
you may know about,
which is all about love at the

00:25:57.828 --> 00:26:01.816
court,
the place of pleasure within

00:26:01.816 --> 00:26:06.048
the unfolding of responsible
life.

00:26:06.048 --> 00:26:09.858
There are so many other texts,
a lot of the Provençal

00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:11.990
poets whom Dante really evokes.
 

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.548
Dante writes about love.
 

00:26:14.548 --> 00:26:18.240
Let me say a couple of things
so that you can really--it's not

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.690
the first time that people
reflect upon love of course.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:27.355
The Greeks tried to do that and
you may remember Socrates who

00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:30.190
always wonders what love is.
 

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.762
Is it a figure of speech,
a manner of feeling or is there

00:26:32.762 --> 00:26:33.818
such a thing as love?
 

00:26:33.818 --> 00:26:37.089
It's--that's just a useless
figure of love.

00:26:37.089 --> 00:26:39.529
Is it a god that possesses me?
 

00:26:39.529 --> 00:26:43.298
Is this a natural instinct that
we call love.

00:26:43.298 --> 00:26:46.673
This variety of passions,
this variety of ways of

00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:50.118
understanding love all figure
within this text.

00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:52.880
The main thing is that Dante
meets Beatrice,

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.440
because if we don't know who
she is,

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.349
does not know what's happening
to him at the age of eight,

00:26:56.349 --> 00:26:59.019
it starts in an involuntary way.
 

00:26:59.019 --> 00:27:02.796
The whole point of this
narrative is that things seem to

00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:06.161
be happening to him,
not only as a passive figure,

00:27:06.161 --> 00:27:08.288
but even love comes to him.
 

00:27:08.288 --> 00:27:11.838
It's--he doesn't will it,
he doesn't look for it,

00:27:11.838 --> 00:27:16.695
and in many ways,
look at this passage here in

00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:19.011
book--
in Chapter II,

00:27:19.011 --> 00:27:25.442
"Nine times already since
my birth the heaven of light had

00:27:25.442 --> 00:27:29.798
circled back to almost the same
point,

00:27:29.798 --> 00:27:35.019
when there appeared before my
eyes," it's appearing,

00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:37.279
it's an apparition,
something gives itself to him,

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:40.950
"before my eyes the now
glorious lady of my mind,

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.746
who was called Beatrice even by
those who did not know what her

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:45.420
name was.
 

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.490
She had been in this life long
enough for the heaven of fixed

00:27:48.490 --> 00:27:51.460
starts to be able to move a
twelfth of a degree to the East

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:53.794
in her time;
that is, she appeared to me at

00:27:53.794 --> 00:27:56.873
about the beginning of her ninth
year," so she's a little

00:27:56.873 --> 00:28:00.001
younger than he is "and I
first saw her near the end of my

00:28:00.001 --> 00:28:00.808
ninth year.
 

00:28:00.808 --> 00:28:04.354
She appeared dressed in the
most patrician of colors,

00:28:04.354 --> 00:28:06.740
a subdued and decorous
crimson...

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:09.170
At that very moment,
and I speak the truth,

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.806
the vital spirit,
the one that dwells in the most

00:28:11.806 --> 00:28:15.030
secret chamber of the heart,
began to tremble so violently

00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:17.970
that even the most minute veins
of my body were strangely

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.796
affected;
and trembling,

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:24.068
it spoke these words:
Here is a god stronger than I

00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:28.769
who is coming to dominate me,
to rule over me."

00:28:28.769 --> 00:28:32.998
This is--these are set
descriptions of what love is,

00:28:32.998 --> 00:28:37.807
the point is that he doesn't
will it, he does not know what

00:28:37.807 --> 00:28:39.298
this is about.
 

00:28:39.298 --> 00:28:43.368
Why does he present himself as
unwilling this passion?

00:28:43.368 --> 00:28:48.496
Because passions which are
unwilled seem to be more

00:28:48.496 --> 00:28:52.700
important than the things that
we will.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.507
If they are unwilled and they
happen to me they may have the

00:28:57.507 --> 00:28:59.868
mark of a secret necessity.
 

00:28:59.868 --> 00:29:02.959
There may be a pattern behind
them that I do not know but it

00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:03.849
happened to me.
 

00:29:03.849 --> 00:29:05.028
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

00:29:05.028 --> 00:29:08.019
I do not have any
responsibility about it.

00:29:08.019 --> 00:29:09.650
I don't know what that is.
 

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:14.368
He will find out in time that
he cannot go on obeying the

00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:19.426
rules of the will that he has to
go on understanding that the

00:29:19.426 --> 00:29:23.220
will needs to be in turn ruled
by reason.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.126
Yet, nothing that he does is
that this figure of love is a

00:29:27.126 --> 00:29:29.390
god, really a literary conceit.
 

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.910
He has no idea who speaks to
him or around him.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:39.797
All around him he takes refuge
in the chamber of his house,

00:29:39.797 --> 00:29:45.279
the chamber of his mind and
there he goes on engaged in

00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:48.019
deliriums, dreams,
etc.

00:29:48.019 --> 00:29:51.529
That is to say,
all the clinical signs of love.

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:55.880
He thinks that love is a
passion that disabilitates him.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:59.984
This whole problem will come to
a head with the first sonnet

00:29:59.984 --> 00:30:02.211
that he writes,
which by the way,

00:30:02.211 --> 00:30:04.368
is really the poem we know.
 

00:30:04.368 --> 00:30:08.856
Dante's seventeen years old
when he wrote this poem,

00:30:08.856 --> 00:30:14.400
we know that this is really a
kind of--sort of--it's a dream.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.332
It's a poem which appears as a
dream which I'll read in English

00:30:18.332 --> 00:30:22.201
in this so and so translation,
but it's better than anything I

00:30:22.201 --> 00:30:23.088
could try.
 

00:30:23.088 --> 00:30:27.707
"To every captive
soul," it's a horrifying

00:30:27.707 --> 00:30:29.788
dream as you can see.
 

00:30:29.788 --> 00:30:32.759
To every captive soul and
loving heart

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:34.779
to whom these words I have
composed are sent

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:39.688
for your elucidation in reply,
greetings I bring for your

00:30:39.688 --> 00:30:41.338
sweet lord's sake,
Love.

00:30:41.338 --> 00:30:43.588
The first three hours,
the hours of the time

00:30:43.588 --> 00:30:45.548
of shining stars,
were coming to an end,

00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:47.950
when suddenly Love appeared
before me

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:50.430
(to remember how it really was
appalls me).

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:53.759
Joyous, Love seemed to me,
holding my heart

00:30:53.759 --> 00:30:55.720
within his hand,
and in his arms he had

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.190
my lady, loosely wrapped in
folds, asleep.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.450
He woke her then,
and gently fed to her

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:06.528
the burning heart;
she ate it, terrified.

00:31:06.528 --> 00:31:09.960
And then I saw him disappear in
tears.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.650
It's a dream,
a horrifying dream about a lady

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:19.660
which is asleep,
held in the arms of the lord of

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:20.618
love.
 

00:31:20.618 --> 00:31:25.440
She wakes and eats the heart,
the heart was given to her.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:32.375
It's a story of clearly how the
heart nourishes love,

00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:35.710
that's the sense of it.
 

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.519
The meaning,
he says, it's a dream,

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:42.318
another involuntary experience,
a dream comes to us without our

00:31:42.318 --> 00:31:44.554
will,
without our wanting it,

00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:48.500
and he says the meaning of this
sonnet was unclear.

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:53.700
He writes the sonnet and sends
it out to his fellow poets in

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.670
Florence.
 

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.220
He sends one of them to the
person who's going to become his

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:01.170
best friend and to whom this
text is dedicated.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:04.200
It will appear very soon in the
text.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.946
His name is Guido Cavalcanti;
we shall see him in Hell by the

00:32:08.946 --> 00:32:09.210
way.
 

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:13.027
Dante put him in Inferno
X and we'll talk about him at

00:32:13.027 --> 00:32:13.598
length.
 

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:18.380
Guido answers,
because that was the fashion,

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.884
just write the poem,
and then by taking your own

00:32:20.884 --> 00:32:22.910
rhyme scheme as a kind of
response,

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:25.858
they go on really writing about
this.

00:32:25.858 --> 00:32:29.240
And Guido Cavalcanti says to
him, well you're really right--

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.961
you really had the vision which
means that you cannot quite

00:32:32.961 --> 00:32:35.507
trust love,
that you really have to turn

00:32:35.507 --> 00:32:35.858
away.
 

00:32:35.858 --> 00:32:40.733
It's a kind of admonition to
you: move away from all of these

00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:45.038
figments of love and turn to
philosophical studies.

00:32:45.038 --> 00:32:48.420
It's only in the mind that you
can find,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.640
and in the pursuits of the
works of the mind,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.971
that you can find some kind of
truth and stability for

00:32:54.971 --> 00:32:55.868
yourself.
 

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:57.721
Outside of it,
there is only--and if you

00:32:57.721 --> 00:33:00.190
pursue love there's the world of
the arrangements.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.608
By the way, another physician
of the time,

00:33:02.608 --> 00:33:05.410
Dante--his name was also Dante,
Dante da Maiano,

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:09.598
he decides to write to him and
also writes about the sonnet.

00:33:09.598 --> 00:33:14.582
He says, well this really means
that you have humoural problems:

00:33:14.582 --> 00:33:18.220
take cold baths and everything
will be okay.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:23.801
You really need to rebalance
the new equilibrium for your

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:24.700
humors.
 

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.778
One reduces love to a question
of bodies,

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:32.130
the physician,
as if it were just a disease,

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:37.365
the other one reduces it to a
question of love's danger

00:33:37.365 --> 00:33:41.048
vis-a-vis the stability of the
mind.

00:33:41.048 --> 00:33:44.960
Dante will go neither with one
and will not listen neither to

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.460
one nor to the other.
 

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:50.535
The rest of the poem will be
that of trying to understand

00:33:50.535 --> 00:33:52.500
what this love really is.
 

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:56.210
Crucial chapters will appear.
 

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.810
Chapter VIII,
he describes his going to a

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:01.606
funeral, you remember,
he sees a dead woman,

00:34:01.606 --> 00:34:05.509
and you wonder what is the
point of this kind of seeing.

00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:09.952
And the point I think that--of
that scene is that there is a

00:34:09.952 --> 00:34:14.168
body and that body is inert and
dead and that there is no

00:34:14.168 --> 00:34:18.309
possible connection between him
and this dead body.

00:34:18.309 --> 00:34:20.880
So that love is not reusable
only to bodies.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.690
There must be some kind of
animation, there must be some

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:30.239
kind of soul that is--or life
that accompanies it.

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.690
In Chapter XII finally,
Dante seems to be moving a

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.000
little bit away from this
Provençal --

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.994
this way of describing love in
terms of conventional terms that

00:34:41.994 --> 00:34:45.889
I have to describe to you,
and he has this other dream

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.356
about the god of love who comes
to him and says it's time for

00:34:49.356 --> 00:34:53.420
you to put aside all simulacra,
all fictions and all emptiness.

00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:56.775
Let me just say a little bit
about more of this point about

00:34:56.775 --> 00:34:59.610
love and a kind of questions
that Dante raises.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.550
Whenever we think about love in
the modern era,

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:04.786
as you know,
these are not my ideas,

00:35:04.786 --> 00:35:07.280
but particularly I believe in
them.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.719
Others have formulated these
ideas.

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:12.650
Whenever we think about love in
modern times that--the

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:15.416
formulation of love is as we
understand it today is

00:35:15.416 --> 00:35:16.800
essentially medieval.
 

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:20.333
The Greeks do not have the
understanding of love the

00:35:20.333 --> 00:35:23.590
way--the romantic idea of love
the way we do.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.775
They understand love as an
intellectual pursuit,

00:35:27.775 --> 00:35:31.159
as an ascent up the ladder of
being.

00:35:31.159 --> 00:35:36.184
That it's the work of
philosophers that the minds can

00:35:36.184 --> 00:35:40.152
go on from degrees--
through the various degrees of

00:35:40.152 --> 00:35:43.530
reality and intellectual reality
and one can grasp it.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:47.309
There is friendship of course,
but there's not the idea of the

00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:51.027
love of a man for a woman which
is so crucial to the romantic

00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:52.639
understanding of love.
 

00:35:52.639 --> 00:35:56.221
The Romans had no understanding
at all about either,

00:35:56.221 --> 00:35:58.820
what the Greeks knew,
what we know.

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:02.487
The most important Latin voice
of--about love is,

00:36:02.487 --> 00:36:04.855
for instance,
I think, Catullus,

00:36:04.855 --> 00:36:08.445
who talks about love as
something to be slightly

00:36:08.445 --> 00:36:10.280
embarrassed about.
 

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:14.509
It's a weakness,
a serious guy does not involve

00:36:14.509 --> 00:36:17.820
oneself in this kind of
pursuits,

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.233
this kind--you have to do the
serious work of living:

00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:24.367
the political issues,
going to the forum,

00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:25.679
negotiate, etc.
 

00:36:25.679 --> 00:36:30.980
But come the Provençal
world in the south of France,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.706
the Provençal courts,
love changes,

00:36:33.706 --> 00:36:37.090
both its meaning and its
contours.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.224
Now love is the love of a man
for a woman and it's usually

00:36:40.224 --> 00:36:42.586
described,
and you can see in Andreas

00:36:42.586 --> 00:36:45.630
Capellanus and The Art of
Courtly Love,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.179
or in the texts of Chretien de
Troyes,

00:36:50.179 --> 00:36:53.880
it's described as maybe it can
be a clandestine,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.300
secret relationship,
it need not be within marriage

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.068
because marriages are--
usually are business

00:37:02.068 --> 00:37:03.159
propositions.
 

00:37:03.159 --> 00:37:08.358
It is a kind of emotion that's
potentially violent,

00:37:08.358 --> 00:37:13.974
in fact the effort one
should--what is the sociology of

00:37:13.974 --> 00:37:14.909
love?
 

00:37:14.909 --> 00:37:18.746
Can a noble man fall in love
with a plebian,

00:37:18.746 --> 00:37:23.119
can a noble woman fall love
with a plebian man?

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:26.449
It's an arrangement about what
love can be,

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:32.644
and yet also they describe it,
they always describe it as the

00:37:32.644 --> 00:37:37.630
experience that causes insomnia,
loss of appetite,

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:42.311
the lover turns pale and can't
speak in the presence of the

00:37:42.311 --> 00:37:44.829
beloved,
they go on describing the

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:46.630
physical properties of love.
 

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.105
The other great revolution
about love is what is contained

00:37:50.105 --> 00:37:51.019
in this text.
 

00:37:51.019 --> 00:37:53.471
He's not the only one;
Dante's not the only one to

00:37:53.471 --> 00:37:54.349
have brought it about.
 

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:57.902
His teachers and people,
the likes of Guido Cavalcanti

00:37:57.902 --> 00:38:01.320
and Guinizelli were going to the
same direction,

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:05.971
namely, that love has to be
explored for the changes it

00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:07.780
brings to the mind.
 

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.599
How can it be?
 

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:11.969
This is the kind of problem
that they raise.

00:38:11.969 --> 00:38:16.369
How can it be that I see a
woman and the image of that

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:18.030
woman obsesses me?
 

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.340
What is it about my mind?
 

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.920
Why do I want to be better than
I am?

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:28.059
How am I going to be educated
in the light of the love that I

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:30.309
feel for this woman?
 

00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:33.657
And in effect,
this kind of metaphysical

00:38:33.657 --> 00:38:38.119
aspect of love is the special
burden of this text.

00:38:38.119 --> 00:38:40.760
Let me just give you an idea,
it happens--

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:44.980
the first time that this
happens is exactly with the

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.360
famous poem that I mentioned to
you that is the turning point,

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.639
Chapter XIX.
 

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:54.219
Let me just read this paragraph.
 

00:38:54.219 --> 00:38:57.163
This is the turning point in
Dante's understanding of what

00:38:57.163 --> 00:38:57.679
love is.
 

00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:03.349
"Then it happened,
that while walking down a path,

00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:06.072
along which ran a very clear
streamâ€¦"

00:39:06.072 --> 00:39:08.650
--
we guess that it's the Arno

00:39:08.650 --> 00:39:09.260
River.
 

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.181
He won't say,
he's not interested in the

00:39:11.181 --> 00:39:13.766
outside world,
he's only interested in what

00:39:13.766 --> 00:39:17.362
love does to his inner self,
to this thought of his mind --

00:39:17.362 --> 00:39:20.518
"I suddenly felt a great
desire to write a poem,

00:39:20.518 --> 00:39:24.199
and I began to think how I
would go about it."

00:39:24.199 --> 00:39:28.197
What an extraordinary moment,
finally he's not just jotting

00:39:28.197 --> 00:39:31.989
down words that come to him,
he just starts thinking.

00:39:31.989 --> 00:39:35.596
This is not just about a self
as desiring or willing,

00:39:35.596 --> 00:39:38.300
or unwilling,
and who lives that kind of

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.916
strange world;
oh it's a good thing that

00:39:40.916 --> 00:39:43.760
things are happening to me
because I can't help it.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:49.253
I can give up my whole exercise
of what I can do,

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:54.288
the sense of purpose about what
is happening,

00:39:54.288 --> 00:39:59.210
changing will into a rational
activity.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.003
Now he starts thinking and:
"I began to think how I

00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:03.018
would go about it.
 

00:40:03.018 --> 00:40:07.284
It seemed to me that to speak
of my lady would not be becoming

00:40:07.284 --> 00:40:10.570
unless I were to address my
words to ladies,

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:14.016
and not just to any ladies,
but only to those who are

00:40:14.016 --> 00:40:15.889
worthy,
not merely to women.

00:40:15.889 --> 00:40:18.199
Then, I must tell you my
tongue,"

00:40:18.199 --> 00:40:20.251
--
he's not out of it yet --

00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:22.989
"as if moved of its own
accord,

00:40:22.989 --> 00:40:27.581
spoke and said:
Ladies who have,"

00:40:27.581 --> 00:40:28.969
--
actually he says,

00:40:28.969 --> 00:40:32.219
"Women who have
intelligence of love.

00:40:32.219 --> 00:40:35.184
With great delight I decided to
keep these words in mind and to

00:40:35.184 --> 00:40:37.050
use them at the beginning of my
poem.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:39.831
Later, after returning to the
aforementioned city and

00:40:39.831 --> 00:40:42.210
reflecting for several days,
I began writing a

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.268
canzone,"
--

00:40:43.268 --> 00:40:46.731
meaning a song,
which for Dante is the noblest

00:40:46.731 --> 00:40:50.829
form of rhetorical form--
and "using this beginning

00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:54.934
and then constructed it in a way
that will appear below in its

00:40:54.934 --> 00:40:55.809
divisions.
 

00:40:55.809 --> 00:40:59.789
The canzone begins:
Ladies who have intelligence of

00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:01.998
love
I wish to speak to you about my

00:41:01.998 --> 00:41:04.623
lady,
not thinking to complete her

00:41:04.623 --> 00:41:06.952
litany,
but to talk in order to relieve

00:41:06.952 --> 00:41:07.500
my heart.
 

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.795
Not thinking to complete her
praise--her praise,

00:41:11.795 --> 00:41:13.989
it's a poem of praise.
 

00:41:13.989 --> 00:41:17.726
Therefore, a religious kind
of--very close to religious

00:41:17.726 --> 00:41:18.280
poems.
 

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.163
As you know,
they're also called

00:41:20.163 --> 00:41:22.652
laude,
laudatory we say in English,

00:41:22.652 --> 00:41:26.420
to come back to--to give you a
sense of what this kind of poems

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.210
can be.
 

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:32.179
To praise, which he would like
us to distinguish from flattery.

00:41:32.179 --> 00:41:36.096
There's a difference between
praising someone and flattering

00:41:36.096 --> 00:41:36.760
someone.
 

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.840
Praising you really don't
expect anything in return,

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.333
you're praising as kind of
sense that you are just trying

00:41:45.333 --> 00:41:49.202
to describe and yielding to the
allure and the power of what is

00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:50.449
in front of you.
 

00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:53.880
Flattery always implies some
kind of circuitness,

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.670
some sort of desire to get
something.

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.164
You flatter,
it's a rhetorical form,

00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:02.728
you flatter because
there's--implies some degree of

00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:03.940
manipulation.
 

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.532
The most important word,
it is "women who have

00:42:07.532 --> 00:42:09.400
intellect of love."
 

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:17.206
Finally, intellect and love are
not two disjointed activities of

00:42:17.206 --> 00:42:18.570
the mind.
 

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:23.119
It's not what Guido Cavalcanti,
who really believes in part,

00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:25.768
who really believes in a world
in which one is sundered one

00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:28.465
from the other,
in a fragmentary world -- and

00:42:28.465 --> 00:42:31.309
we will come to that in
Inferno X --

00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:34.635
who really thinks that time is
all fragmented from itself

00:42:34.635 --> 00:42:36.507
anyway,
experiences are all

00:42:36.507 --> 00:42:40.199
fragmentary, that love--
if I have a passion I can never

00:42:40.199 --> 00:42:42.469
quite come to understand
anything.

00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:46.061
In fact, when I am in throes of
passion my mind ceases its

00:42:46.061 --> 00:42:46.880
operations.
 

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:52.737
This poem is written against
Dante's best friend to whom this

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:54.690
text is dedicated.
 

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:57.686
We are forced to think,
and I'll go back with this poem

00:42:57.686 --> 00:43:00.242
in a moment,
but let me make a brief

00:43:00.242 --> 00:43:04.061
digression about the
relationship between friendship

00:43:04.061 --> 00:43:04.960
and love.
 

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:12.130
They're two extraordinary
virtues.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.280
We call them passions,
but they're also virtues.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.710
Is there anything better than
friendship?

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.940
Is there anything better than
love?

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.952
Dante says -- this is the
radical way of Dante's thinking

00:43:24.952 --> 00:43:27.333
--
he brings us to the point where

00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:31.251
you really have to distinguish
between things that seem to be

00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:33.079
equally powerful virtues.
 

00:43:33.079 --> 00:43:34.280
What is friendship?
 

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.148
The text is dedicated to Guido
Cavalcanti which means that

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:40.389
friendship implies a
conversation,

00:43:40.389 --> 00:43:42.289
a conversation of minds.
 

00:43:42.289 --> 00:43:46.117
The word conversation,
as you know in Latin means,

00:43:46.117 --> 00:43:48.150
things turning together.
 

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.280
That's why the minds--when you
are conversing,

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:56.210
minds are turning together in
some kind of harmonious turning,

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.103
looking for some common
agreements and there is a sort

00:44:00.103 --> 00:44:04.291
of benevolence implied in
friendship that presupposes even

00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:06.570
what you are going to find.
 

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.920
We are going to--not only its
benevolence,

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.951
it's the condition for
friendship, it's really the

00:44:10.951 --> 00:44:13.393
point of arrival,
we've got to like each other

00:44:13.393 --> 00:44:15.010
even more after we discuss.
 

00:44:15.010 --> 00:44:17.226
We disagree,
but we are doing it

00:44:17.226 --> 00:44:18.300
benevolently.
 

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.000
That's the gift of friendship.
 

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.139
It's a virtue.
 

00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:24.329
In the Ethics of
Aristotle, it counts as this,

00:44:24.329 --> 00:44:27.201
one of the major virtues--and
so does Dante in his own

00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:30.342
rewriting of the Ethics
of Aristotle which is the

00:44:30.342 --> 00:44:31.210
Banquet.
 

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:38.568
But love for Dante here is more
important than friendship and

00:44:38.568 --> 00:44:45.315
it's more important for
friendship because it forces you

00:44:45.315 --> 00:44:46.909
to think.
 

00:44:46.909 --> 00:44:50.630
Something happens to you and
that mobilizes your mind.

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.230
You've got to go looking for
the signs of love;

00:44:53.230 --> 00:45:00.146
you try to look for what kind
of sign is my beloved sending to

00:45:00.146 --> 00:45:01.280
me, etc.
 

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:06.326
The mind is engaged in an
extended self -- mode of

00:45:06.326 --> 00:45:08.179
self-reflection.
 

00:45:08.179 --> 00:45:11.074
So intellect and love now
rolled together,

00:45:11.074 --> 00:45:12.768
that's the revolution.
 

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:16.559
Let me go back to them that I
have been--with which I started.

00:45:16.559 --> 00:45:20.300
This is the beginning of the
so-called "Sweet New

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.289
Style."
 

00:45:21.289 --> 00:45:25.081
The kind of poetry that the
Tuscans write and which is a

00:45:25.081 --> 00:45:29.010
sort of rethinking of what the
Provençal poets were

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:29.699
doing.
 

00:45:29.699 --> 00:45:33.512
The Provençal poets are
writing poetry in the mode of

00:45:33.512 --> 00:45:35.503
"I tremble,
and I shake,

00:45:35.503 --> 00:45:39.130
and the image of the beloved I
cannot even tell anybody.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.840
I have to keep my passion away
from the flatterers because they

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.490
are going to violate my secret
and so I have to always protect

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.371
this,
I have to protect the identity

00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:49.440
of the beloved,"
--

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:54.280
in a sense singularity and
uniqueness to this passion.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:57.800
The Tuscan poets Dante,
Cavalcanti,

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.969
Guinizelli they come along and
say no,

00:46:01.969 --> 00:46:04.795
no what matters is that love
can become part of an

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:07.679
intellectual experience and
intellectual ascent.

00:46:07.679 --> 00:46:13.153
And knowledge only favors love,
and love mobilizes the mind to

00:46:13.153 --> 00:46:14.679
go on thinking.
 

00:46:14.679 --> 00:46:20.742
See, I really don't want to say
too much now because we have so

00:46:20.742 --> 00:46:23.090
much time ahead of us.
 

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.695
The great debate,
philosophical debates in the

00:46:26.695 --> 00:46:30.141
thirteenth century,
is always the following:

00:46:30.141 --> 00:46:35.030
it's between the so-called
voluntarists and rationalists.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:38.769
Very simple don't--the
voluntarists are those who

00:46:38.769 --> 00:46:42.199
believe that if I want to know
something,

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:46.541
I have to love first,
that love is crucial to my

00:46:46.541 --> 00:46:47.650
knowledge.
 

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:55.809
If I--probably you remember
from your own early youth,

00:46:55.809 --> 00:47:00.489
when some of you would be
interested enough in a boy,

00:47:00.489 --> 00:47:03.639
or the boy and the girl,
someone would say,

00:47:03.639 --> 00:47:05.030
"oh you really love that
person."

00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.880
What do you mean?
 

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.759
I don't know--even know him;
I don't even know her,

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:12.771
that's really the issue--if you
love so that you may know,

00:47:12.771 --> 00:47:15.800
that's the position of the
voluntarists.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.400
Others would say you have to
know first in order that you may

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.021
love, and it's a fierce debate;
Dante's circumventing all of

00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:25.469
this.
 

00:47:25.469 --> 00:47:31.018
Intellect and love are like the
two feet that carry us along,

00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:33.420
and you move one and you move
the other,

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.780
and only this way can you walk
without being hobbled.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.309
They say it would be later when
he starts in Inferno.

00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:43.943
So, this is the great change,
what you call the Sweet New

00:47:43.943 --> 00:47:44.320
Style.
 

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:46.139
The Sweet New Style means,
therefore,

00:47:46.139 --> 00:47:48.672
a highly philosophical,
highly intellectual kind of

00:47:48.672 --> 00:47:50.893
poetry,
a poetry where the woman or the

00:47:50.893 --> 00:47:53.659
love of a woman can take you up
to the divinity,

00:47:53.659 --> 00:47:56.916
love through love,
and the understanding that that

00:47:56.916 --> 00:47:59.909
which rules the world is not
just an idea,

00:47:59.909 --> 00:48:04.309
it's just love and therefore
love is the only way of coming

00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:06.130
to it and pursuing it.
 

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:13.666
Some examples of this kind of
experience will happen very

00:48:13.666 --> 00:48:14.610
soon.
 

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:21.106
I want to mention this great
poem that he describes,

00:48:21.106 --> 00:48:27.856
this little sonnet where
he--which also--which sort of

00:48:27.856 --> 00:48:33.079
pursues immediately after
Chapter XX.

00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:35.030
Let's look at the sonnet.
 

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.730
"After the canzone
had become..."

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.666
-- this canzone about
"Women who have intellect

00:48:43.666 --> 00:48:44.730
of love"
-- "...

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.019
had become rather well known,
one of my friends who had heard

00:48:48.019 --> 00:48:50.706
it was moved asked me to write
about the nature of

00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:51.639
Love..."
 

00:48:51.639 --> 00:48:57.001
-- that's not what he--forget
about the experiences about

00:48:57.001 --> 00:49:00.065
being sleepless,
but Dante starts as a

00:49:00.065 --> 00:49:03.146
Provençal poet,
he's not refining their idea

00:49:03.146 --> 00:49:05.869
and wants to think about the
nature of love,

00:49:05.869 --> 00:49:09.190
philosophical idea about love
having--

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.329
without losing sight of
Beatrice-- "...

00:49:11.329 --> 00:49:13.375
having perhaps,
from reading my poem,

00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:16.159
acquired more confidence in me
than I deserved.

00:49:16.159 --> 00:49:18.833
So, thinking that after my
treatment with the previous

00:49:18.833 --> 00:49:21.710
theme it would be good to treat
the theme of Love and,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:23.268
feeling that I owed this to my
friend,

00:49:23.268 --> 00:49:25.860
I decided to compose a poem
dealing with Love.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.860
And I wrote this sonnet which
begins:

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.860
Love and the gracious heart are
a single thing

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:37.154
as Guinizelli [who's another
poet of the Sweet New Style ,

00:49:37.154 --> 00:49:39.865
is the father of the sweet new
style]

00:49:39.865 --> 00:49:43.490
tells us in his poem:
one can no more be without the

00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:45.554
other
than can be a reasoning mind

00:49:45.554 --> 00:49:46.780
without its reason.
 

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.789
Nature, when in a loving mood,
creates them

00:49:49.789 --> 00:49:55.751
This is the shift now the full
awareness that learning about

00:49:55.751 --> 00:49:56.460
love.
 

00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:58.867
Dante's gone to the school of
the philosophers,

00:49:58.867 --> 00:50:00.489
in order to learn about this.
 

00:50:00.489 --> 00:50:06.641
This means that this whole text
really is traversed by two

00:50:06.641 --> 00:50:11.065
inter-related themes,
they're two stories,

00:50:11.065 --> 00:50:15.489
two thematic strains running
through.

00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:19.875
One is the story of a love for
Beatrice, Dante's love for

00:50:19.875 --> 00:50:23.869
Beatrice, and we have
understanding what love is.

00:50:23.869 --> 00:50:28.679
Is it a physical impulse?
 

00:50:28.679 --> 00:50:30.349
Is it a demon?
 

00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:32.869
Is it a figure of speech?
 

00:50:32.869 --> 00:50:35.885
Is it a simulacrum,
another fiction that we tell

00:50:35.885 --> 00:50:36.719
each other?
 

00:50:36.719 --> 00:50:41.190
Or not, and he goes on learning
about this.

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:47.045
The other thematic strain of
this text has to do with

00:50:47.045 --> 00:50:49.750
learning to be a poet.
 

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:54.969
Dante is also telling us the
story of his poetic growth.

00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:57.929
How he begins imitating the
Provençal poets,

00:50:57.929 --> 00:51:00.500
imitating now the poets of the
Sweet New Style,

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:03.688
and finally finding his voice,
and how the two themes really

00:51:03.688 --> 00:51:07.146
shed light on each other because
I can only understand this about

00:51:07.146 --> 00:51:10.389
love and if I understand really
things about love that nobody

00:51:10.389 --> 00:51:13.545
else has understood,
I can really go on writing

00:51:13.545 --> 00:51:16.791
about the poem --
writing poems that nobody else

00:51:16.791 --> 00:51:19.969
can go on writing which is a
famous promise,

00:51:19.969 --> 00:51:22.639
the hope he expresses in
Chapter XLII.

00:51:22.639 --> 00:51:25.114
And if I can go on writing
about love in a way that nobody

00:51:25.114 --> 00:51:28.284
else has ever written,
it means that I understand love

00:51:28.284 --> 00:51:30.909
more than others have understood
love.

00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:33.376
At any rate,
the great poem that he starts

00:51:33.376 --> 00:51:41.784
writing when he's,
in a sense, even in a kind of

00:51:41.784 --> 00:51:53.275
rivalry with Guinizelli,
appears in the sonnet that

00:51:53.275 --> 00:51:55.820
starts here.
 

00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:59.532
I could mention 21,
"The power of Love borne

00:51:59.532 --> 00:52:03.634
in my lady's eyes,"
where now it's not only about

00:52:03.634 --> 00:52:08.199
the nature of love but he goes
on trying to find love within

00:52:08.199 --> 00:52:09.360
Beatrice.
 

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.840
It's not the god of love that
has been abandoned,

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.429
it's not the conceit of love,
it's not the words,

00:52:14.429 --> 00:52:17.396
the strange and enigmatic words
of love that have come to him

00:52:17.396 --> 00:52:21.556
from oracles and traditions,
now that is love for the

00:52:21.556 --> 00:52:25.280
concreteness of Beatrice
herself.

00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:28.820
As I said earlier,
very much in passing,

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:36.454
the text has an extraordinary
sonnet that I read in Italian a

00:52:36.454 --> 00:52:42.076
couple lines,
a few lines so you can hear the

00:52:42.076 --> 00:52:44.389
sound of this poem.
 

00:52:44.389 --> 00:52:47.659
Chapter XXVI,
this is about Beatrice,

00:52:47.659 --> 00:52:52.619
the apparition of Beatrice,
she goes by through the streets

00:52:52.619 --> 00:52:56.438
and the world is silent,
the world falls silent,

00:52:56.438 --> 00:52:58.800
it's a kind of general
apparition,

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.318
but also she's wrapped in a
kind of mystery and an

00:53:03.318 --> 00:53:05.440
inapproachable light.
 

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:07.260
There's always some kind of
distance.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.268
This is the poem.
 

00:53:08.268 --> 00:53:12.244
Such sweet decorum,
[page 57 of this edition,

00:53:12.244 --> 00:53:14.920
Chapter XXVI]
and such gentle grace

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.518
attend my lady's greeting as
she moves

00:53:17.518 --> 00:53:19.489
that lips can only tremble into
silence,

00:53:19.489 --> 00:53:22.170
and eyes dare not attempt to
gaze at her.

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:24.670
Moving, benignly clothed in
humility,

00:53:24.670 --> 00:53:27.389
untouched by all the praise
along the way,

00:53:27.389 --> 00:53:29.480
she seems to be a creature come
from Heaven

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.260
to earth, to manifest a miracle.
 

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:38.556
We are now--Dante appears as a
sort of poetical caress because

00:53:38.556 --> 00:53:43.719
of love, heaven,
and earth mixed up in his head.

00:53:43.719 --> 00:53:47.815
Beatrice brings heaven down to
earth and asks of him that he

00:53:47.815 --> 00:53:51.909
can rise up to heaven and these
are the words in Italian.

00:53:51.909 --> 00:53:55.682
Listen to the repartitions,
the sounds, the "n"

00:53:55.682 --> 00:53:59.646
sounds:
Tanto gentile e tanto onesta

00:53:59.646 --> 00:54:02.516
pare 
la donna mia quand'ella

00:54:02.516 --> 00:54:03.889
altrui saluta,

00:54:03.889 --> 00:54:05.791
ch'ogne lingua deven
tremando muta,

00:54:05.791 --> 00:54:07.217
e li occhi no l'ardiscon di

00:54:07.217 --> 00:54:07.590
guardare.
 

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:11.659
Ella si va,
sentendosi laudare 

00:54:11.659 --> 00:54:18.449
Only praise can come in toward
her--in her direction.

00:54:18.449 --> 00:54:23.230
Finally, how does he
really--how does Dante really

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:28.693
get out of this sense of
constant wonder because that's a

00:54:28.693 --> 00:54:30.840
poem about wonder.
 

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.360
Beatrice appears and it's a
miracle,

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.543
wonder, and that's how you
start thinking as soon as you

00:54:36.543 --> 00:54:40.130
believe that what you perceive
is a wonder that you don't quite

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:41.000
understand.
 

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.460
You want to go on trying to
understand it.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.101
Now that's the heart of the
effort of reflection,

00:54:47.101 --> 00:54:47.710
right?
 

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:53.387
So there's this kind of a sense
of constant perplexity,

00:54:53.387 --> 00:54:57.909
great excitement at the idea of
Beatrice.

00:54:57.909 --> 00:55:01.951
Now Beatrice has died,
her death appears around

00:55:01.951 --> 00:55:03.268
Chapter XXIX.
 

00:55:03.268 --> 00:55:07.742
How real can she be now that
she's--well how are you going to

00:55:07.742 --> 00:55:10.130
relate to someone who is dead?
 

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:14.539
Dante will do that which
probably some others can--could

00:55:14.539 --> 00:55:14.940
do.
 

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.947
We try to find a replacement
and we go looking for someone

00:55:18.947 --> 00:55:22.885
who looks exactly like her or
reminds him of her and then

00:55:22.885 --> 00:55:28.309
finds this,
Chapter XXXII, XXXIII, XXXIV;

00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:31.726
this woman who has a lot of--so
much mercy, sense of mercy for

00:55:31.726 --> 00:55:33.630
him that he's very drawn to her.
 

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:37.529
He understands that in the
measure in which he tries to

00:55:37.529 --> 00:55:41.067
duplicate Beatrice,
then the love for Beatrice was

00:55:41.067 --> 00:55:45.818
not really singular;
that his own project was at

00:55:45.818 --> 00:55:47.159
stake here.
 

00:55:47.159 --> 00:55:50.742
Either you believe in the
singularity of the figure you

00:55:50.742 --> 00:55:54.393
love, or if you believe in the
duplication, then you are

00:55:54.393 --> 00:55:56.650
undercutting your own project.
 

00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:01.041
So he's caught in all this
drama until finally he sees some

00:56:01.041 --> 00:56:03.168
pilgrims,
and this is really the great

00:56:03.168 --> 00:56:05.054
direction,
and with this I will stop and

00:56:05.054 --> 00:56:06.610
see if there are some questions.
 

00:56:06.610 --> 00:56:12.585
Chapter XL, some pilgrims,
the pilgrimages that used to go

00:56:12.585 --> 00:56:17.199
to Santiago de Compostela,
as they do now.

00:56:17.199 --> 00:56:21.083
They used to go to the
famous--from the north of

00:56:21.083 --> 00:56:23.545
Europe,
the so called--they would go to

00:56:23.545 --> 00:56:25.574
Jerusalem,
they would go to the Via

00:56:25.574 --> 00:56:28.461
Francigena as it is called,
that goes from the north

00:56:28.461 --> 00:56:30.791
following a particular path,
they go to Rome,

00:56:30.791 --> 00:56:32.869
and here this is some pilgrims
going--

00:56:32.869 --> 00:56:37.733
they're called romei. He
sees some pilgrims going to Rome

00:56:37.733 --> 00:56:43.210
and this is the poem he writes,
this is an extraordinary poem.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:44.407
"Ah, pilgrims...
 

00:56:44.407 --> 00:56:45.889
" he addresses them.
 

00:56:45.889 --> 00:56:49.809
They don't listen to him,
they know nothing about him.

00:56:49.809 --> 00:56:51.822
He addresses them:
..

00:56:51.822 --> 00:56:55.867
.moving pensively along,
thinking, perhaps,

00:56:55.867 --> 00:57:01.059
of things at home you miss,
could the land you come from be

00:57:01.059 --> 00:57:03.567
so far away
(as anyone might guess from

00:57:03.567 --> 00:57:06.110
your appearance)
that you show no sign of grief

00:57:06.110 --> 00:57:09.856
as you pass through
the middle of the desolated

00:57:09.856 --> 00:57:10.599
city...
 

00:57:10.599 --> 00:57:13.652
This is a phrase that normally
is used for Jerusalem,

00:57:13.652 --> 00:57:16.117
"desolated,
" "the abandoned

00:57:16.117 --> 00:57:16.411
city.
 

00:57:16.411 --> 00:57:18.760
" This is Florence,
though....

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.940
like people who seem not to
understand,

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.570
the grievous weight of woe it
is has to bear?

00:57:23.570 --> 00:57:26.639
If you would stop to listen to
me speak,

00:57:26.639 --> 00:57:30.869
I know, from what my sighing
heart tells me,

00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:33.099
you would be weeping when you
leave this place:

00:57:33.099 --> 00:57:35.699
lost is the city's source of
blessedness,

00:57:35.699 --> 00:57:38.320
and I know words that could be
said of her

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.880
with power to humble any man to
tears.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.972
This is--it's really another
great shift in the movement of

00:57:46.972 --> 00:57:47.940
the poem.
 

00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:53.639
He sees pilgrims who are going
somewhere and he realizes that

00:57:53.639 --> 00:57:56.869
he is not like them;
he's not going anywhere;

00:57:56.869 --> 00:58:00.699
he is moving in circles.
 

00:58:00.699 --> 00:58:03.340
If you move in circles,
you get nowhere.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:07.449
Now, something happens around
him that will,

00:58:07.449 --> 00:58:11.273
in many ways,
shake him from that kind of

00:58:11.273 --> 00:58:16.530
circular self-absorption in
which he finds himself.

00:58:16.530 --> 00:58:18.949
The second thing is that he
understands.

00:58:18.949 --> 00:58:21.199
This is an extraordinary poem.
 

00:58:21.199 --> 00:58:24.320
Read it again for yourselves
when you have a chance.

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.585
He says he understands that the
mythology he has been

00:58:28.585 --> 00:58:33.920
constructing about Beatrice is
an absolutely private mythology.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.079
It means nothing to anybody
else.

00:58:36.079 --> 00:58:39.382
You who come from afar,
and he's like them,

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:43.077
because he too is--they are
separated pensively,

00:58:43.077 --> 00:58:45.829
a word that implies suspension.
 

00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:47.865
The same word,
"to think"

00:58:47.865 --> 00:58:49.722
and "to be
suspended,"

00:58:49.722 --> 00:58:51.940
it's the same etymology in
Latin.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:56.188
They are halfway:
they are here now going through

00:58:56.188 --> 00:58:58.456
Florence,
going somewhere to a

00:58:58.456 --> 00:59:02.014
destination, and nostalgically
separated from the world they

00:59:02.014 --> 00:59:02.920
left behind.
 

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:04.994
And Dante too,
is not going anywhere,

00:59:04.994 --> 00:59:08.164
but he doesn't have Beatrice
with him and has no idea of

00:59:08.164 --> 00:59:10.411
where he -- though,
unlike the pilgrims,

00:59:10.411 --> 00:59:11.449
where to go.
 

00:59:11.449 --> 00:59:15.800
Above all, if I were to tell
you anything,

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.025
you would understand that this
is a desolated city but you do

00:59:19.025 --> 00:59:20.835
not know,
an implication is,

00:59:20.835 --> 00:59:22.000
you may not care.
 

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.610
My mythology is private.
 

00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:29.657
The effort I have to make is to
transform my private mythology

00:59:29.657 --> 00:59:31.809
into a public discourse.
 

00:59:31.809 --> 00:59:35.208
This is the transition from the
Vita nuova to the

00:59:35.208 --> 00:59:36.380
Divine Comedy.
 

00:59:36.380 --> 00:59:40.246
The Divine Comedy would
be a text where finally Dante

00:59:40.246 --> 00:59:43.543
will go on literally,
theatricalizing,

00:59:43.543 --> 00:59:47.420
literally staging his own
passion,

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:51.061
through the passions of others,
involving all others in his

00:59:51.061 --> 00:59:54.452
discourse and creating what I
would call a "public

00:59:54.452 --> 00:59:55.710
mythology."
 

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.322
This is really the most
important moment that--which

00:59:58.322 --> 01:00:01.398
ends with another journey of the
mind that will make the next

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:04.164
one,
Beyond the sphere that makes

01:00:04.164 --> 01:00:07.530
the widest round,
passes the sigh arisen from my

01:00:07.530 --> 01:00:09.550
heart;
A new intelligence that Love in

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:11.409
tears
endowed it with is urging it on

01:00:11.409 --> 01:00:11.710
high.
 

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:16.097
Here he sees Beatrice far away
and decides to undertake his

01:00:16.097 --> 01:00:18.458
journey,
the journey of knowledge,

01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:21.820
the journey of exploration of
the journey which will--

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:27.056
which is the journey of life
and which is the journey at the

01:00:27.056 --> 01:00:32.384
heart of the comedy or the
Divine Comedy with which we

01:00:32.384 --> 01:00:34.159
start next time.
 

01:00:34.159 --> 01:00:41.016
This is really the kind of
experience, poetic experience

01:00:41.016 --> 01:00:45.630
that Dante will go on at the
start.

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:46.849
He's still a young man.
 

01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:50.409
He's exploring a lot of
possibilities;

01:00:50.409 --> 01:00:54.072
he's gathering all the voices
around him, but he internalizes

01:00:54.072 --> 01:00:54.500
them.
 

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.550
They are not--it's not that
it's still the kind of

01:00:57.550 --> 01:01:00.724
encyclopedic text that the
Divine Comedy will

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.429
necessarily be,
but he has to evolve all

01:01:03.429 --> 01:01:05.269
discourses,
all whispers,

01:01:05.269 --> 01:01:07.210
all groans, all noises.
 

01:01:07.210 --> 01:01:10.230
The whole world has to speak
through his poem.

01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:14.768
That's part of the most
inclusive vision,

01:01:14.768 --> 01:01:18.510
not excluding anything,
but this is a time is--

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:22.579
it's an effort to try to find
himself as a poet with a project

01:01:22.579 --> 01:01:26.115
and that project will be
necessarily a project for the

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:26.849
future.
 

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:31.431
There is no poet that I know in
the Western tradition who is so

01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:35.789
given to the idea of the future
and who is more of a poet of

01:01:35.789 --> 01:01:37.489
hope than Dante is.
 

01:01:37.489 --> 01:01:39.835
I call him a lot of things,
and I will call him a lot of

01:01:39.835 --> 01:01:40.219
things.
 

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:43.630
I'll call him the poet of
exile, which he is.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:45.510
I'll call him the poet of love,
which he is.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.289
I'll call him the poet of
peace, which he is.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:52.536
There's an irenic thrust
underneath his whole--even his

01:01:52.536 --> 01:01:54.739
polemics, fierce polemics.
 

01:01:54.739 --> 01:01:58.731
But above all,
and now, for now he appears as

01:01:58.731 --> 01:02:02.905
the poet of hope,
in the knowledge that hope is

01:02:02.905 --> 01:02:05.989
the most realistic of virtues.
 

01:02:05.989 --> 01:02:11.086
Because he tells us that the
past, not even the past may be

01:02:11.086 --> 01:02:16.623
dead, that really despair is the
most crucial sin that one could

01:02:16.623 --> 01:02:18.909
have in this universe.
 

01:02:18.909 --> 01:02:22.739
Belief is to say that things
are over and done with.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:25.389
Dante says I'm not done yet.
 

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:28.715
I still have a project I can't
even begin to tell you about it,

01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:31.719
but let me stop now because I
have other things to do.

01:02:31.719 --> 01:02:34.902
That's the substance of this
poem, and in this sense,

01:02:34.902 --> 01:02:37.780
it's a preamble,
a preparation for the Divine

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:38.699
Comedy.
 

01:02:38.699 --> 01:02:43.297
Since I'm trying to give you a
sense of Dante's own life as a

01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:46.440
flesh and bone kind of guy that
he was.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.989
What happens after this poem?
 

01:02:48.989 --> 01:02:52.018
Beatrice has died;
literally in 1289 she dies.

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:58.969
Dante now is married--marries a
woman he will never mention,

01:02:58.969 --> 01:03:04.809
belongs to a decent family in
Florence,

01:03:04.809 --> 01:03:08.360
the Donati, troublemakers that
Dante doesn't really like.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.900
And Dante will enter public
life.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.914
This public life,
which also means,

01:03:14.914 --> 01:03:19.967
that he will have a great
interruption to his intellectual

01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:21.119
pursuits.
 

01:03:21.119 --> 01:03:25.097
Until in 1302,
as I--probably you remember,

01:03:25.097 --> 01:03:29.168
I mentioned,
he's banned from Florence to go

01:03:29.168 --> 01:03:30.590
into exile.
 

01:03:30.590 --> 01:03:35.333
And once he's in exile,
then his production will start

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:36.050
again.
 

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.465
He started writing about the
language, the theatre of the

01:03:38.465 --> 01:03:40.793
language, one of the first
treatises on language in the

01:03:40.793 --> 01:03:41.570
Western world.
 

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:45.771
He writes a text of ethics
which is the Banquet and

01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:48.130
then the Divine Comedy.
 

01:03:48.130 --> 01:03:51.996
We'll begin next time;
we'll find them in the middle

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:55.268
of his journey which is Canto I.
 

01:03:55.268 --> 01:03:59.739
Since we have a few minutes,
do we have questions?

01:03:59.739 --> 01:04:02.829
I said a lot of things.
 

01:04:02.829 --> 01:04:06.958
I hope it was--I'll go back to
some of these things so

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:08.440
don't--Questions?
 

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:19.494
Student:  Well,
this is not exactly about the

01:04:19.494 --> 01:04:21.420
lecture,
it's about the text,

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.512
do you recommend that we go
over the specific text that you

01:04:25.512 --> 01:04:29.548
recommend on the syllabus or--
I already own the Mandelbaum

01:04:29.548 --> 01:04:32.940
translation that--
is that usable for this course

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.610
as well?
 

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.605
Prof: Yes,
the question is,

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:38.871
do I recommend that the
students stick to the text that

01:04:38.871 --> 01:04:42.501
I mention in the syllabus or can
they go on using other texts

01:04:42.501 --> 01:04:44.860
such as Mandelbaum's
translation?

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.686
The answer is yes you can,
it's a very good--Mandelbaum's

01:04:48.686 --> 01:04:51.489
translation is a very good
translation.

01:04:51.489 --> 01:04:55.733
I don't use it for one simple
reason, because he's a dear

01:04:55.733 --> 01:04:59.068
friend of mine,
he probably will hear me now,

01:04:59.068 --> 01:05:01.570
everything will be on record.
 

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:04.789
Poets have a weakness.
 

01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:07.518
When they translate they do it
out of great love for the texts.

01:05:07.518 --> 01:05:12.065
Deep down this idea,
look at it, I can do one better

01:05:12.065 --> 01:05:17.235
than even Dante and he lapses
into that and I have told him

01:05:17.235 --> 01:05:18.929
more than once.
 

01:05:18.929 --> 01:05:23.429
I like this unpretentious
translation by Sinclair.

01:05:23.429 --> 01:05:27.143
Prose sometimes is wrong;
I will tell you when it is

01:05:27.143 --> 01:05:30.831
blatantly wrong,
but you can use Mandelbaum,

01:05:30.831 --> 01:05:36.079
or if you have Singleton or you
have Durling and Martinez,

01:05:36.079 --> 01:05:39.764
or if you have--actually I
think is really better than all

01:05:39.764 --> 01:05:43.070
of these,
Hollander's, Robert Hollander.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:45.679
Actually the translation is by
his wife Jean.

01:05:45.679 --> 01:05:49.268
You can use any translation you
want.

01:05:49.268 --> 01:05:53.590
They are not really all that
different from each other,

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:55.619
it's usually the sound,
and of course,

01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:59.000
Mandelbaum as a poet has a
sense of the rhythm in English;

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.309
but absolutely.
 

01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:03.250
Yes?
 

01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.782
Student:  I'm not quite
sure I understand how love as a

01:06:06.782 --> 01:06:10.083
process of acquiring knowledge
is different or better than

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:12.494
friendship,
or like the harmonious turning

01:06:12.494 --> 01:06:13.829
&gt;.
 

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:14.947
Prof: Yeah.
 

01:06:14.947 --> 01:06:18.858
The question is very good first
of all, and is why should I make

01:06:18.858 --> 01:06:22.396
a claim that love as a process
of knowledge is better than

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:23.389
friendship?
 

01:06:23.389 --> 01:06:25.500
You are really singling out
that which is the--

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.889
one of the dramas of the
Vita nuova,

01:06:27.889 --> 01:06:31.389
a book dedicated to--Dante
dedicates to his best friend,

01:06:31.389 --> 01:06:34.090
Guido Cavalcanti,
and yet it's about Beatrice.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.010
When Cavalcanti appears he
says, forget about love,

01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:41.603
just turn to philosophy in a
sonnet that is very well known

01:06:41.603 --> 01:06:44.929
and that I quote in some piece
or other.

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:47.239
There is a tension between the
two,

01:06:47.239 --> 01:06:50.545
love and friendship,
and we agree and you seem to be

01:06:50.545 --> 01:06:53.318
agreeing with a very generic,
not unusual,

01:06:53.318 --> 01:06:55.820
the description that I make of
friendship.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:58.940
A friendship is really the
language of philosophers,

01:06:58.940 --> 01:06:59.429
right?
 

01:06:59.429 --> 01:07:03.882
Philosophers who get together
and believe in thought and

01:07:03.882 --> 01:07:07.929
believe also that friendship is
a great virtue,

01:07:07.929 --> 01:07:13.409
there's a lot of drama within
friendships and in literature,

01:07:13.409 --> 01:07:15.760
friendships are trying to outdo
each other.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.199
I'm a better friend than you.
 

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:21.250
To me, I'm a better friend to
you than you are to me,

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:25.202
as soon as you talk about that
kind of rivalry you realize that

01:07:25.202 --> 01:07:28.010
passions also are getting to
that process.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:32.652
I would say that Dante--I
understand Dante to imply here

01:07:32.652 --> 01:07:37.126
that love is better than
friendship exactly because it

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:41.534
forces,
it does violence on our ways of

01:07:41.534 --> 01:07:45.405
thinking,
because it forces us never to

01:07:45.405 --> 01:07:49.637
take anything for granted,
and in and of itself,

01:07:49.637 --> 01:07:53.742
because this may even be
something that you find very

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:56.550
romantic,
people can find very romantic.

01:07:56.550 --> 01:08:01.090
The idea that in love you are
going to be surprised by what

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:05.789
the signs of love are and
ubiquitous of the idea of love,

01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:09.365
whereas, in friendship you
really have a sort of the

01:08:09.365 --> 01:08:11.119
clarity of an exchange.
 

01:08:11.119 --> 01:08:15.744
In love you are going to have
the secret signs that lovers can

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:17.109
give each other.
 

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:21.190
To me, a great text that maybe
Dante--I'm sure Dante read is

01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:22.158
really Ovid.
 

01:08:22.158 --> 01:08:24.328
You go and read all these
stories,

01:08:24.328 --> 01:08:26.268
great stories,
but the story of Pyramus and

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:29.038
Thisbe,
lovers who can see the smallest

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:33.287
chink in the wall through which
to communicate and all the

01:08:33.287 --> 01:08:35.970
inventiveness that comes with
it.

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:39.689
In a sense, it's really where
the idea that love can--

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:45.913
I say, can force us to think
about in ways that we could

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:50.840
never really imagine,
because it is tied to the

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.989
imagination.
 

01:08:51.989 --> 01:08:54.029
Okay?
 

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.199
That's what I would say.
 

01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:56.939
Other questions?
 

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:03.850
Okay, I think that that's it.
 

01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:06.878
I will see you next Thursday in
some detail and then goes on

01:09:06.878 --> 01:09:09.139
writing a hermeneutics of"
with Canto I,

01:09:09.139 --> 01:09:09.550
etc.
 

01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:10.220
Thank you.

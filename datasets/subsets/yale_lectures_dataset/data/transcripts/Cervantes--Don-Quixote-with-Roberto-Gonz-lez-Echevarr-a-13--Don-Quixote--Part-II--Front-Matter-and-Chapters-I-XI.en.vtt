00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.709
Prof: I want to begin
today by mentioning a virtual

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:10.770
literary fact,
a story that does not happen;

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:18.000
one that only exists in the 'as
if' of literature.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.849
It's a make believe,
but--literature is make

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.505
believe--but that it's
nevertheless suggestive of the

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:31.340
enigmatic and even prophetic
powers of literature.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.794
In talking the last time about
Cervantes's reaction to the

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:39.390
publication of Avellaneda's
Quixote,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.617
of which he learned when he was
writing chapter XXXVI of his own

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:50.000
second part,
we failed to mention a change

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.200
he made in Don Quixote's plans
to distinguish his own book from

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.600
that of the imposter.
 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.741
You may remember that in
mentioning the possibility of a

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:09.352
third sally at the end of Part I
there is a reference to some

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:20.830
jousts in Saragossa,
you have a handout to help you,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.010
no?
 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.900
You have it already?
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.290
It should have gotten to each
one of you, if not...

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:42.610
 
 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.824
And at the beginning of
Cervantes's Part II it is again

00:01:46.824 --> 00:01:51.741
said that Don Quixote will go to
Saragossa to participate in the

00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:55.400
tournament,
which takes place during the

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.500
celebration of Saint George's
Day--

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.180
Saint George is a saint who was
a knight--

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.799
on April 23.
 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.945
This is where Don Quixote is
headed as he sets forth for the

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:12.080
third time.
 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.075
But it so happens that
Avellaneda had also taken the

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:22.758
cue from Part I of the Saragossa
jousts and had his own Don

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:28.438
Quixote actually go and
participate in the tournament.

00:02:28.438 --> 00:02:33.091
This was enough for Cervantes
to change Don Quixote's

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:38.101
destination in mid novel and
have him divert to Barcelona

00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.590
without passing through
Saragossa,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.771
which is what he does in the
book: Avellaneda's goes to

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:55.872
Saragossa,
Don Quixote's veers and goes to

00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:58.660
Barcelona.
 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.545
This is all well and good,
another instance of Cervantes'

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:05.598
reaction to the apocryphal
Quixote.

00:03:05.598 --> 00:03:10.240
What Cervantes could not have
known,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:18.508
of course, is that April 23,
the day of those jousts,

00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:22.449
would be the date of his own
death,

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:28.970
so that he avoided unknowingly,
of course,

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.120
having the end of his book
announce his own end.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.676
Now, this is all,
needless to say,

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:43.896
speculation on my part,
a fiction making on my part,

00:03:43.896 --> 00:03:48.818
but such implied coincidences
make me wonder sometimes,

00:03:48.818 --> 00:03:57.598
is literature always an evading
or a postponement of death?

00:03:57.598 --> 00:04:02.533
There is more to the telling of
stories than the telling of

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:06.686
stories,
as Scheherazade knew when she

00:04:06.686 --> 00:04:10.884
told story after story,
night after night,

00:04:10.884 --> 00:04:15.401
forestalling her own demise in
the One Thousand and One

00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.509
Nights.
 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:22.238
You remember that Scheherazade
tells stories to avoid her being

00:04:22.238 --> 00:04:25.168
slain,
so she tells stories to

00:04:25.168 --> 00:04:30.240
forestall her own death,
so in some implicit way,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.190
perhaps only in my overheated
imagination,

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.666
this is what happens when
Cervantes has his character

00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:46.769
swerve away from April 23,
so much for that.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.812
April 23, by the way,
is a bad day for great writers,

00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:54.310
it is the date on which
Shakespeare also died,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.720
the same year as Cervantes.
 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.420
Not exactly the same day,
close enough,

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.312
the same date,
because England and Spain used

00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:06.108
a different calendar,
so there was a difference of

00:05:06.108 --> 00:05:09.430
two or three days,
but April 23 is also the date

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.459
of Shakespeare's death.
 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:17.370
There is something magical
about April 23,

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.011
so much so that Alejo
Carpentier, the great Cuban

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:26.750
writer about whom I have written
a great deal,

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.819
also died on April 23,
centuries later.

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:40.468
So we should warn all writers
not to take very seriously April

00:05:40.468 --> 00:05:44.285
23,
but I'm sure that some wishing

00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:50.413
to be as great as Cervantes and
Shakespeare or Carpentier would

00:05:50.413 --> 00:05:54.483
take it,
and would rather just die on

00:05:54.483 --> 00:05:58.399
April 23 to be as great as they
were.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.930
So perhaps this is just a
mnemonic device,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.483
something to make you remember
the date of Cervantes's death to

00:06:08.483 --> 00:06:13.142
which we will return when we
read his farewell in the

00:06:13.142 --> 00:06:18.430
prologue to the Trials of
Persiles y Sigismunda.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:24.569
Now, let us return to the issue
of the new features of Part II.

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.329
I remarked on the discussion
among Don Quixote,

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:32.245
the priest and the barber about
Spain's political situation and

00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:36.908
the arbitristas,
those who offered solutions to

00:06:36.908 --> 00:06:39.430
the problems at hand.
 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.673
I remarked that the discussion
should be seen in the context of

00:06:43.673 --> 00:06:47.370
my commentary on the speech
about arms and letters,

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:53.310
when I said that by the
sixteenth century,

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.786
government had become the
object of intellectual

00:06:56.786 --> 00:07:00.855
reflection and mentioned
Machiavelli's The Prince

00:07:00.855 --> 00:07:04.110
as a founding work of political
science.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.410
I also told you that,
during the sixteenth century,

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.326
there were not a few books
written about the education of

00:07:12.326 --> 00:07:16.172
The Prince in which
guidelines were offered about

00:07:16.172 --> 00:07:19.319
how to prepare a young man for
kingship,

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.089
for being a ruler.
 

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:24.250
All of these preoccupations are
in the background of this

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.509
discussion among the three
characters.

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:29.470
What the discussion also
indicates--

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.622
and this is very
significant--is that the

00:07:33.622 --> 00:07:38.714
Quixote, Part II,
is the first political novel

00:07:38.714 --> 00:07:43.769
because it deals and
incorporates current events,

00:07:43.769 --> 00:08:02.680
such as the expulsion of the
moriscos.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.459
The moriscos were the
Arabs who remained after the

00:08:07.459 --> 00:08:09.680
fall of Granada in 1492.
 

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.632
Of course, there were large
communities of Arabs in Spain

00:08:12.632 --> 00:08:16.334
and many remained,
and they were by decree and by

00:08:16.334 --> 00:08:21.437
force compelled to abandon not
only their religion but their

00:08:21.437 --> 00:08:23.869
practices,
and so forth,

00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:27.528
the customs,
and they were expelled from

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:33.250
Spain at the time that Cervantes
was writing Part II of the

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.933
Quixote,
and this polemical event is

00:08:37.933 --> 00:08:41.149
incorporated into the novel.
 

00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:46.453
This is why I say that the
Quixote Part II is the first

00:08:46.453 --> 00:08:48.019
political novel.
 

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:53.678
In Part II there is also a
bitter satire of the aristocracy

00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:59.003
and their irresponsible ways,
in the figures of the Duke and

00:08:59.003 --> 00:09:01.500
Duchess that you will meet
later.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.893
The satire of the
arbitristas is part of

00:09:05.893 --> 00:09:11.052
these political thematic,
and Don Quixote's acting like

00:09:11.052 --> 00:09:13.440
an arbitrista.
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.614
He does, remember,
the idea that he has on how to

00:09:16.614 --> 00:09:18.070
fight off the Turks.
 

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.149
It's part of the critique of
the nobility,

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:25.366
even if Don Quixote is a
pathetic and impoverished

00:09:25.366 --> 00:09:27.480
hidalgo,
but here he is trying to play

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.210
the role of the
arbitristas.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.450
This is what the king should do.
 

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.135
Another new factor is that
three or four of the initial

00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:41.429
chapters in Part II take place
indoors, be it in Don Quixote's

00:09:41.429 --> 00:09:45.791
or Sancho's house;
in contrast to Part I a great

00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:51.030
deal of Part II will take place
indoors reflecting a more urban

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.058
setting in the novel.
 

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:57.120
You will have the village of El
Toboso and Barcelona.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.096
Inns will still play a role,
but not as important as Juan

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:05.432
Palomeque's in Part I,
and, remember,

00:10:05.432 --> 00:10:10.277
the holes in the roof of that
inn to be in Palomeque's inn was

00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:12.740
almost to still be outdoors.
 

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:20.282
Here, in Part II there will be
houses, mansions and cities like

00:10:20.282 --> 00:10:26.485
El Toboso, which is merely a
village, and Barcelona,

00:10:26.485 --> 00:10:29.649
which is a great city.
 

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:33.429
The novel, the modern novel
that develops from the

00:10:33.429 --> 00:10:37.647
Quixote will be essentially
an urban genre dealing with

00:10:37.647 --> 00:10:43.494
cities--
so you think of Balzac--because

00:10:43.494 --> 00:10:52.159
in cities there are more people
engaged in playing many

00:10:52.159 --> 00:10:56.936
different roles,
there is a thicker social

00:10:56.936 --> 00:10:57.500
context.
 

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:02.341
So we can see in this
development a movement towards

00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.620
the city in the novel.
 

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.690
Although one could say that if
the remote kernel of the novel,

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.259
of the modern novel is La
Celestina--

00:11:14.259 --> 00:11:15.558
about which I have talked many
times--

00:11:15.558 --> 00:11:18.298
that work already takes place
in a city,

00:11:18.298 --> 00:11:20.727
presumably Salamanca,
and although much of the

00:11:20.727 --> 00:11:22.778
picaresques take place on the
road,

00:11:22.778 --> 00:11:25.028
there are also cities in
Lazarillo,

00:11:25.028 --> 00:11:27.447
and particularly in the
Guzmán de

00:11:27.447 --> 00:11:28.370
Alfarache.
 

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.383
Being indoors,
but also outdoors,

00:11:31.383 --> 00:11:36.092
much of the action of Part II
takes place at night,

00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:37.600
in the dark.
 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:42.190
We had night episodes in Part
I: the fulling hammers,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.860
the fracas at the inn,
the episode with the dead body,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.581
but most of it takes place
outdoors on the road and in

00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:54.769
daylight.
 

00:11:54.769 --> 00:11:59.347
Not so in Part II,
in which the darkness will play

00:11:59.347 --> 00:12:03.178
an important role in several
episodes,

00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:07.856
and there are two that actually
take place underground,

00:12:07.856 --> 00:12:08.808
in caves.
 

00:12:08.808 --> 00:12:13.888
Part II, as we will soon see is
more baroque,

00:12:13.888 --> 00:12:19.658
and the buildings and darkness
contribute to it.

00:12:19.658 --> 00:12:25.649
Another development in Part II
is its being scripted and

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:30.407
performed in the present,
presumably as we read,

00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:35.220
not in the past by Cide Hamete
Benengeli and his translators.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.710
It is being improvised on the
go;

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:40.268
in addition,
and as already remarked,

00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:43.964
many characters have read Part
I, which serves as the

00:12:43.964 --> 00:12:47.658
background, as a model,
as it were, for Part II.

00:12:47.658 --> 00:12:52.158
We already had had intimations
of this in Part I,

00:12:52.158 --> 00:12:56.682
the novel being scripted and
written as the novel takes

00:12:56.682 --> 00:13:00.200
place: in the episode of the
dead body,

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.134
when Sancho gives Don Quixote
the moniker the Knight of the

00:13:03.134 --> 00:13:06.351
Sorrowful Countenance,
the hidalgo remarks that the

00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:09.769
writer must have put the idea in
Sancho's head,

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:13.841
suggesting that the novel is
being written as they perform

00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:14.200
it.
 

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:19.011
But now, we have the plans and
preparations for the action

00:13:19.011 --> 00:13:23.149
being discussed by the
characters, particularly by

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:25.428
Sansón Carrasco.
 

00:13:25.428 --> 00:13:30.595
In Part II, Part I plays the
role that the romances of

00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:33.129
chivalry play in Part I.
 

00:13:33.129 --> 00:13:36.504
Let me repeat that,
because it's a bit convoluted:

00:13:36.504 --> 00:13:40.154
in Part II, Part I plays the
role that the romances of

00:13:40.154 --> 00:13:42.220
chivalry played in Part I.
 

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.365
It is the original that the
characters who have read it want

00:13:46.365 --> 00:13:50.019
Don Quixote to reproduce and act
according to it,

00:13:50.019 --> 00:13:56.442
so a new larger mirror has been
added to the play of mirrors

00:13:56.442 --> 00:13:59.490
already present in Part I.
 

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.500
Don Quixote belongs to a
previous fiction that the new

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.509
characters who have read it want
him to be true to.

00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:12.538
Everything now is part of Don
Quixote's fiction.

00:14:12.538 --> 00:14:18.673
Sansón Carrasco is the
most important new character to

00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:20.720
emerge in Part II.
 

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.399
He has a harsh sounding name,
Sansón Carrasco.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:30.807
He is a town boy,
the son of Bartolomé

00:14:30.807 --> 00:14:34.833
Carrasco, who studied in
Salamanca, and has come back

00:14:34.833 --> 00:14:37.080
with a Bachelor's degree.
 

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:43.168
He is another of several
university graduates in the

00:14:43.168 --> 00:14:46.181
Quixote,
the first being the priest,

00:14:46.181 --> 00:14:50.005
but the most memorable one,
so far, Grisóstomo,

00:14:50.005 --> 00:14:51.580
as you remember.
 

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.899
This is a reflection of the
importance of universities in

00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:58.594
Spain during this period,
particularly after the work of

00:14:58.594 --> 00:15:01.850
Cardinal Francisco
Jiménez de Cisneros,

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.870
about who you have read in
Elliott,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.120
who founded the University of
Alcalá.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.866
There is a mild satire of the
intellectuals in the figure of

00:15:11.866 --> 00:15:16.432
Sansón Carrasco,
as there is in that of the

00:15:16.432 --> 00:15:19.808
priest in Part I,
and throughout Part II.

00:15:19.808 --> 00:15:22.746
The priest was the graduate of
a lesser university,

00:15:22.746 --> 00:15:24.038
not quite Salamanca.
 

00:15:24.038 --> 00:15:27.057
He is called Sansón,
to begin the part of the satire

00:15:27.057 --> 00:15:29.609
is that he is called
Sansón but he is quite

00:15:29.609 --> 00:15:33.017
small;
he is not a giant like the

00:15:33.017 --> 00:15:35.350
Samson of the Bible.
 

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:40.820
But most importantly,
he is a jokester,

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.517
a prankster,
an avid reader of romances of

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:47.443
chivalry,
and particularly of Part I of

00:15:47.443 --> 00:15:51.509
the Quixote,
which he seems to know by heart.

00:15:51.509 --> 00:15:55.523
To judge by comments he makes,
he was also a reader of Boiardo

00:15:55.523 --> 00:15:58.899
and Ariosto,
so Sansón spent his time

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:03.682
at Salamanca reading literature,
not studying theology,

00:16:03.682 --> 00:16:07.320
which is what he was supposed
to do.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.413
He is the counterpart of the
Canon of Toledo in Part I,

00:16:12.413 --> 00:16:17.320
but is not solemn and pedantic
like the canon was;

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.298
he is quite the opposite.
 

00:16:19.298 --> 00:16:24.490
Sansón is a reader of
Part I.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.105
Part I, again,
is to him what the romances of

00:16:27.105 --> 00:16:28.950
chivalry were to Don Quixote.
 

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:32.431
He wants to reenact it,
just like Don Quixote wanted to

00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:35.590
reenact and dramatize the
romances of chivalry.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.917
His plan to cure Don Quixote is
to defeat him within the fiction

00:16:40.917 --> 00:16:44.996
of his madness,
like the priest and the barber

00:16:44.996 --> 00:16:48.025
in Part I,
but in doing so he will become

00:16:48.025 --> 00:16:51.682
another Quixote,
his double in a truer sense

00:16:51.682 --> 00:16:54.769
than all of the others in Part
I.

00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:59.269
If Part I was held together by
the overarching plot of the

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:04.480
persecution and capture of Don
Quixote by the Holy Brotherhood,

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.490
the barber and the priest,
in Part II that role is played

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:13.143
by Sansón's schemes,
to bring Don Quixote back

00:17:13.143 --> 00:17:18.150
within the fiction that he has
helped him create.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:21.317
That is, Sansón has
helped create another fiction

00:17:21.317 --> 00:17:24.140
for Don Quixote,
which is really not a fiction;

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.030
that is that Don Quixote a
great knight errant,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:28.980
already the object of a book.
 

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:33.680
So he imbues Don Quixote with
this idea, you are a great

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.980
character already in a book,
so you have to act accordingly.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:46.328
In Part II, Sansón is
the main author within the book.

00:17:46.328 --> 00:17:50.084
Cide Hamete Benengeli was a
distant author,

00:17:50.084 --> 00:17:55.269
at least thrice removed by
translators and transcribers.

00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:59.930
Sansón and others,
like the duke's steward,

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.516
whom you will meet soon enough,
will be authors within the

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:07.670
fiction we read and will script
the action and watch it unfold,

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.808
most of the time not like they
intended it to.

00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:17.944
As author figures they are,
but particularly Sansón,

00:18:17.944 --> 00:18:22.726
quite complex and modern,
their intentions rarely match

00:18:22.726 --> 00:18:24.318
their results.
 

00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:27.906
Much of the fun,
of the humor in Part II is

00:18:27.906 --> 00:18:33.288
following the elaborate schemes
of internal authors that go awry

00:18:33.288 --> 00:18:38.839
when the opposite of what they
had planned actually happens,

00:18:38.839 --> 00:18:42.440
some of them spectacularly.
 

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.307
This has much to say about
authorship, about the creation

00:18:46.307 --> 00:18:50.590
of fiction and about Cervantes's
own creation of the fiction of

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.180
the Quixote.
 

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.190
I say that it is quite a modern
conception of the author because

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.358
this is the conception we have
in the modern period of authors.

00:19:02.358 --> 00:19:07.227
The whole of Deconstruction,
the famous literary movement

00:19:07.227 --> 00:19:12.007
that was mostly started here at
Yale had to do with fine

00:19:12.007 --> 00:19:17.568
deconstructing authors showing
how their intentions rarely,

00:19:17.568 --> 00:19:22.450
if ever, matched the results,
but that is another story.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:29.630
Now, Sancho and Teresa--oh no.
 

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:33.817
So in the hands of
Sansón and other readers

00:19:33.817 --> 00:19:38.067
of Part I,
the action in Part II is poised

00:19:38.067 --> 00:19:41.682
between the past,
their remembrance of Part I,

00:19:41.682 --> 00:19:44.392
and the future;
their scripts based on it,

00:19:44.392 --> 00:19:46.000
so it's poised in that.
 

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.038
It's like a balancing act
between the past Part I and the

00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:54.818
future in the scripts that they
prepare.

00:19:54.818 --> 00:19:58.260
Hence, it is like an action
that unfolds in the present as

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.797
it is being written,
or just after following scripts

00:20:01.797 --> 00:20:05.675
whose development we,
as readers, can more or less

00:20:05.675 --> 00:20:06.329
follow.
 

00:20:06.329 --> 00:20:12.180
Part II is a text in the making;
we learn this quite early in

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:17.296
chapter V, in the episode when
Sancho goes home to convince his

00:20:17.296 --> 00:20:21.338
wife that he must accompany Don
Quixote again.

00:20:21.338 --> 00:20:26.093
This is an issue and an episode
that I discussed briefly at the

00:20:26.093 --> 00:20:30.538
end of my last lecture but that
I want to revisit today.

00:20:30.538 --> 00:20:37.036
So the question of translation
and improvisation resurfaces

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:37.818
here.
 

00:20:37.818 --> 00:20:40.990
Chapter V Part II begins,
in your translation:

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:43.190
"The translator of this
story,

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:45.160
coming to write this fifth
chapter,

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.452
says he takes it to be
apocryphal, because in it Sancho

00:20:48.452 --> 00:20:51.682
talks in another style than
could be expected from his

00:20:51.682 --> 00:20:55.392
shallow understanding,
and says such subtle things

00:20:55.392 --> 00:20:59.440
that he reckons impossible that
he should know them.

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.489
Nevertheless,
he would not omit translating

00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:04.221
them to comply with the duty of
his office and so went on

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.150
saying..."
 

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.608
And the chapter begins.
 

00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:10.876
A little further,
it is again,

00:21:10.876 --> 00:21:14.309
reported,
quote: "This kind of

00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:18.553
language and what Sancho says
further below made the

00:21:18.553 --> 00:21:23.128
translator of this story say he
takes this chapter to be

00:21:23.128 --> 00:21:24.960
apocryphal."
 

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.605
Let us step by step reconstruct
what the comment by the

00:21:28.605 --> 00:21:32.520
translator at the beginning of
chapter X suggests about the

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:36.911
status of the text that we read,
but keeping in mind that all of

00:21:36.911 --> 00:21:40.386
these games of authorship and
textuality do not lead to an

00:21:40.386 --> 00:21:41.730
ultimate coherence.
 

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.291
We cannot really pin down
Cervantes on the issue of

00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:49.105
authorship,
how many authors or

00:21:49.105 --> 00:21:53.711
translators, and we cannot pin
him down either on which is

00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:55.490
finally 'the text'.
 

00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:01.358
The text exists supposedly in
the original,

00:22:01.358 --> 00:22:06.950
in a form that seems to be
apocryphal;

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:12.560
that is, that it is false,
either a bogus addendum by

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.094
somebody else,
or a falsifying rewriting of

00:22:17.094 --> 00:22:17.848
it.
 

00:22:17.848 --> 00:22:20.890
Did Cide Hamete write it this
way?

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.797
Or was it falsified in some way
so that Sancho appears talking

00:22:23.797 --> 00:22:24.368
like this?
 

00:22:24.368 --> 00:22:28.907
Then it is translated into the
text we read by a reluctant

00:22:28.907 --> 00:22:32.887
translator who alludes to its
falseness but decides

00:22:32.887 --> 00:22:36.788
nevertheless to translate and
transcribe it,

00:22:36.788 --> 00:22:40.509
but adding a note about its
falsity.

00:22:40.509 --> 00:22:45.557
It is a text that is erased as
it is being written and that

00:22:45.557 --> 00:22:48.430
should disappear as we read it.
 

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:52.560
Moreover, there is a question
of temporality:

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:56.130
when does it exist and in what
form?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:59.682
The answer is that it only
exists at the moment of each

00:22:59.682 --> 00:23:00.338
reading.
 

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:04.760
This is, I think,
a model of how the entire of

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.028
Part II exists,
poised, as I said,

00:23:08.028 --> 00:23:12.692
between the remembrances of
Part I and the future actions

00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:16.690
scripted by the internal authors
of Part II,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:20.160
actions that don't turn out to
be quite like the script.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.229
Furthermore,
the translator's admonition

00:23:23.229 --> 00:23:28.028
raises the issues if mimesis:
which Sancho is the real one?

00:23:28.028 --> 00:23:32.741
Is it the one he remembers from
Part I or the new Sancho who has

00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:37.154
evolved improving his speech and
endowed with the desire for

00:23:37.154 --> 00:23:40.480
social advancement,
not just for wealth?

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.896
The translator's quip reveals
that Sancho has changed,

00:23:45.896 --> 00:23:48.348
that he is not static.
 

00:23:48.348 --> 00:23:52.049
In fact, that reality,
in general, is not static,

00:23:52.049 --> 00:23:55.519
and true mimesis,
to be very much aware of the

00:23:55.519 --> 00:23:58.680
changing nature of things and
people.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:02.752
So there is an inherent
provisional nature to the text

00:24:02.752 --> 00:24:06.519
that we read and to the whole of
Part II that,

00:24:06.519 --> 00:24:12.038
as which I'll suggest later,
is part of its Baroque nature.

00:24:12.038 --> 00:24:17.172
It is clear that here Sancho is
playing the role of Don Quixote,

00:24:17.172 --> 00:24:19.535
in this chapter,
and his wife,

00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:22.548
that of himself as he used to
be.

00:24:22.548 --> 00:24:26.102
This is hilarious,
which is why he corrects her

00:24:26.102 --> 00:24:28.420
mistakes when she misspeaks.
 

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:33.549
He is echoing Don Quixote's
ideas, revealing that he has

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:38.185
been quixotized;
but also that he has acquired

00:24:38.185 --> 00:24:39.410
new values.
 

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:45.026
All this comes out in the
discussion of their daughter's

00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:50.743
marriage, which they are
discussing from different points

00:24:50.743 --> 00:24:51.970
of view.
 

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.796
She wanted her to marry her
equal and Sancho wanted her to

00:24:56.796 --> 00:25:00.858
marry somebody of higher status,
and so forth.

00:25:00.858 --> 00:25:04.909
Sancho's social ambition is
reflected in his intellectual

00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:06.788
improvement and swagger.
 

00:25:06.788 --> 00:25:10.173
In Part II of the
Quixote Sancho will play a

00:25:10.173 --> 00:25:14.101
more central role and prove
himself to be capable of things

00:25:14.101 --> 00:25:18.298
that would not have been thought
possible by the Sancho of Part

00:25:18.298 --> 00:25:18.838
I.
 

00:25:18.838 --> 00:25:22.866
The changes in Sancho,
his elevation in status,

00:25:22.866 --> 00:25:28.118
have an ideological dimension
as well as an aesthetic one.

00:25:28.118 --> 00:25:33.455
The poor and humble can learn
and advance, and novelistic

00:25:33.455 --> 00:25:38.029
characters move up and down the
social ladder.

00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:41.390
This element of the
Quixote,

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.358
which is a political element,
too, anticipates the

00:25:44.358 --> 00:25:47.577
enlightenment,
and ideas that lead to concepts

00:25:47.577 --> 00:25:51.531
about social leveling that will
eventually lead to modern

00:25:51.531 --> 00:25:56.486
conceptions of democracy,
but it also has a profoundly

00:25:56.486 --> 00:25:58.769
Christian background.
 

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:04.998
We can recall Matthew's Gospel,
chapter V, the opening words of

00:26:04.998 --> 00:26:07.608
the Sermon on the Mount.
 

00:26:07.608 --> 00:26:10.728
I quote: "Blessed [these
are the Beatitudes],

00:26:10.728 --> 00:26:14.419
blessed are the poor in spirit
for theirs is the Kingdom of

00:26:14.419 --> 00:26:17.637
Heaven;
blessed are they that mourn for

00:26:17.637 --> 00:26:22.278
they shall be comforted;
blessed are the meek for they

00:26:22.278 --> 00:26:24.980
shall inherit the earth."
 

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:25.880
Unquote.
 

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.940
If characters in novels will
evolve,

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:30.338
they do so within a social
context,

00:26:30.338 --> 00:26:33.383
so this consonant with the
political character of the

00:26:33.383 --> 00:26:36.411
novel,
but this has also much to do

00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:40.608
with the development and
evolution of realism in

00:26:40.608 --> 00:26:43.910
literature,
particularly in the novel.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:53.019
This brings me to Erich
Auerbarch, I gave you a handout

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:59.598
that happens to be an obituary
note--

00:26:59.598 --> 00:27:04.016
oh, you don't have it yet--it
happens to be an obituary note

00:27:04.016 --> 00:27:07.608
written by none other than
René Wellek.

00:27:07.608 --> 00:27:11.679
René Wellek was a great
professor here at Yale for many

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:14.065
years,
the founder of the discipline

00:27:14.065 --> 00:27:17.019
of comparative literature in the
United States.

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:22.355
It so happens that all of the
professors and critics that I

00:27:22.355 --> 00:27:28.058
will be mentioning in my lecture
today were Yale professors.

00:27:28.058 --> 00:27:32.989
Yale has been at the forefront
of literary studies for many,

00:27:32.989 --> 00:27:36.750
many years, and this is a
reflection of it;

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.818
I didn't plan it this way but
it so happens.

00:27:41.818 --> 00:27:46.535
So if you have a chance read
that obituary note but I'll give

00:27:46.535 --> 00:27:50.779
you a thumbnail sketch of
Auerbach and his theories.

00:27:50.779 --> 00:27:55.862
Now, the critic who put forth
this theory about Christianity

00:27:55.862 --> 00:28:00.685
and the development of realism
was Erich Auerbarch in his

00:28:00.685 --> 00:28:05.596
outstanding book Mimesis:
the Representation of Reality

00:28:05.596 --> 00:28:11.032
in Western Literature,
first published in the original

00:28:11.032 --> 00:28:17.228
German in Switzerland in 1946,
a year after the end of World

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.318
War One.
 

00:28:18.318 --> 00:28:24.130
We will be talking about him
next week,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.038
when you read his essay in the
Casebook which is drawn

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:29.950
from the book Mimesis
about the enchanted Dulcinea.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:35.910
Auerbach--this is my thumbnail
sketch of Auerbach--

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.818
who was Jewish,
was born in Berlin,

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:43.107
he was trained in the German
philological tradition and would

00:28:43.107 --> 00:28:45.536
eventually become,
along with Leo Spitzer,

00:28:45.536 --> 00:28:48.200
who you will also meet in the
Casebook,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.460
one its best known scholars.
 

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.942
After participating as a
combatant in World War I he

00:28:54.942 --> 00:28:59.595
earned a doctorate in 1921,
and in 1929 become a member of

00:28:59.595 --> 00:29:03.355
philology faculty at the
University of Marburg publishing

00:29:03.355 --> 00:29:07.789
a well-received study Dante:
Poet of the Secular World,

00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:10.259
a book that still is read.
 

00:29:10.259 --> 00:29:14.083
With the rise of Nazism,
however, Auerbach was forced to

00:29:14.083 --> 00:29:18.255
vacate his position in 1934--he
was thrown out because he was

00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:19.019
Jewish.
 

00:29:19.019 --> 00:29:22.067
Exiled from Nazi Germany,
he took up residence in

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:24.070
Istanbul,
Turkey, where he wrote

00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.172
Mimesis,
generally considered his

00:29:26.172 --> 00:29:29.028
masterwork and one of the best
books of literary criticism of

00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:30.220
the twentieth century.
 

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.400
He has said,
in a moving statement,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.208
that he wrote such a general
book because in Istanbul he did

00:29:37.208 --> 00:29:40.630
not have his books or the
journals that he needed,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.730
so he just went for the big
works in Western literature,

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.032
and so it was these terrible
circumstances that had the happy

00:29:48.032 --> 00:29:49.970
result of Mimesis.
 

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:55.838
Auerbach moved to the United
States in 1947,

00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:58.298
first teaching at Pennsylvania
State University,

00:29:58.298 --> 00:30:00.942
and then working at the
Institute for Advanced Study in

00:30:00.942 --> 00:30:01.528
Princeton.
 

00:30:01.528 --> 00:30:05.827
In 1950 he was made Sterling
Professor of Romance Languages

00:30:05.827 --> 00:30:10.570
at Yale, a position that he held
until his death while here being

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:12.349
a professor in 1957.
 

00:30:12.349 --> 00:30:14.538
He died in Wallingford.
 

00:30:14.538 --> 00:30:18.865
I have to say that as a holder
myself of a Sterling chair here

00:30:18.865 --> 00:30:22.977
at Yale I feel honored and
humbled to have a precursor like

00:30:22.977 --> 00:30:26.210
Auerbach,
whose work and memory I cherish.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.432
The main idea of
Mimesis,

00:30:28.432 --> 00:30:32.685
a broad and profound one,
is about the Christian mixture

00:30:32.685 --> 00:30:37.403
of the sublime and the low style
in the New Testament leading up

00:30:37.403 --> 00:30:41.888
of the emergence of realism,
the representation of every day

00:30:41.888 --> 00:30:44.990
life and common people in
serious literature.

00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:51.080
We take this for granted now,
but it was not so until the New

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.298
Testament.
 

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:56.758
This was a break away from the
strict distinction between high

00:30:56.758 --> 00:31:01.143
and low style in the classical
tradition by which the serious

00:31:01.143 --> 00:31:03.875
genres,
like epic and tragedy,

00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:06.660
dealt with outstanding
figures--

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.567
including gods--and was written
in a high rhetorical style where

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:14.756
common speech had no place,
whereas the minor genres,

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:17.632
like comedy,
dealt with low class people who

00:31:17.632 --> 00:31:20.220
speak in vulgar speech and are
invariably comical.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:27.351
Auerbach derived his idea from
Saint Augustine and the church

00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:28.538
fathers.
 

00:31:28.538 --> 00:31:33.005
The church fathers were those
who during the Middle Ages wrote

00:31:33.005 --> 00:31:36.665
comments on scripture and
expanded and deepened the

00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:38.348
Christian doctrine.
 

00:31:38.348 --> 00:31:42.368
They include major philosophers
like Saint Thomas Aquinus,

00:31:42.368 --> 00:31:45.048
who wrote in the thirteenth
century.

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:48.048
There are Greek fathers and
Latin fathers;

00:31:48.048 --> 00:31:49.558
I mean, there is a
patrologia,

00:31:49.558 --> 00:31:51.906
that is, the writing of the
fathers, in Latin and another

00:31:51.906 --> 00:31:52.618
one in Greek.
 

00:31:52.618 --> 00:31:57.940
Auerbach labels sermo
humilis,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:05.746
humble sermon,
this Christian response to the

00:32:05.746 --> 00:32:16.744
classical separation of styles
which was derived from Aristotle

00:32:16.744 --> 00:32:24.153
and Roman rhetorical theory--
that separation of style was

00:32:24.153 --> 00:32:27.038
derived from Aristotle and Roman
rhetorical theory.

00:32:27.038 --> 00:32:31.558
The mixture of the transcendent
and the low style is exemplified

00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:35.305
by Christ's passion,
through which the quotidian

00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:38.343
drama of mankind,
everyday drama of man,

00:32:38.343 --> 00:32:42.037
assumes a more profound
meaning: life does not end in

00:32:42.037 --> 00:32:44.880
the brief span of worldly
existence,

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:49.180
eternity is present in it as a
message of hope.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.400
Seth Lerer writes about
Auerbach:

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:58.101
"Auerbach finds an
apparently low or humble diction

00:32:58.101 --> 00:33:01.868
pressed into the service of
transcendent spirituality.

00:33:01.868 --> 00:33:05.298
Developing an argument of
Augustians here on the power of

00:33:05.298 --> 00:33:08.790
the Christian words stripped of
the trappings of classical

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.789
eloquence,
Auerbach sees the progress of

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:15.807
late antique and medieval
literature as moving inexorably

00:33:15.807 --> 00:33:19.608
towards a synthesis of the
humble and the sublime.

00:33:19.608 --> 00:33:22.679
[One could say that the
Quixote embodies such a

00:33:22.679 --> 00:33:25.170
synthesis of the humble and the
sublime].

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:29.243
Auerbach's debt to Vico
[Giambattista Vico--he has a

00:33:29.243 --> 00:33:32.440
very nice brief name easy to
remember.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.279
He is a great Italian
philosopher of the eighteenth

00:33:37.279 --> 00:33:40.859
century]
have been brought out to show

00:33:40.859 --> 00:33:43.568
his understanding."
 

00:33:43.568 --> 00:33:48.940
Vico found that the stories,
the literature,

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:55.193
the lore of the people are very
much a part of their culture and

00:33:55.193 --> 00:33:59.065
has a philosophy--
I'm just simplifying this--that

00:33:59.065 --> 00:34:02.192
is very compelling because,
his basic argument is,

00:34:02.192 --> 00:34:05.416
that humans understand only
that which was created by

00:34:05.416 --> 00:34:07.140
humans,
not by gods.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:12.048
Therefore, he has the story of
mankind begin not with Genesis

00:34:12.048 --> 00:34:16.221
but after the flood,
when man remakes on his own the

00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:17.039
world.
 

00:34:17.039 --> 00:34:20.461
This is just so that you can
read Vico some day as an

00:34:20.461 --> 00:34:23.820
enticement, but of course,
it's a simplification.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:31.027
Now, you will see all of this
in action and understand much

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:37.364
better the essay on the
enchanted Dulcinea with this

00:34:37.364 --> 00:34:39.230
background.
 

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:42.099
Having said that,
that chapter on the

00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:44.969
Quixote is a very polemical
one,

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:50.445
that was very badly received by
hispanists and by Cervantes

00:34:50.445 --> 00:34:52.693
scholars--
it was added to Mimesis

00:34:52.693 --> 00:34:55.480
later--
because through his study of

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.728
the mixture of styles Auerbach
comes up with the idea in the

00:35:00.728 --> 00:35:02.619
end--
that I think is very

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:05.510
questionable--that the
Quixote is mainly or

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:09.518
essentially a comical book,
but we will get to that after

00:35:09.518 --> 00:35:13.878
you've read that essay on a
chapter that you will have read

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:16.186
by then,
or are reading now,

00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:20.262
that hilarious chapter when
Sancho tries to convince Don

00:35:20.262 --> 00:35:24.708
Quixote that these wenches that
come on from donkeys includes

00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:27.949
Dulcinea,
and it's an episode that I will

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:31.659
be discussing later,
it's an episode that always

00:35:31.659 --> 00:35:34.920
makes me laugh every time I
reread it,

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.329
no matter how many thousands of
times,

00:35:37.329 --> 00:35:42.679
I laugh, particularly when Don
Quixote reports that the alleged

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:47.597
Dulcinea smelled of raw garlic
and that he was dismayed by

00:35:47.597 --> 00:35:49.936
this,
but we'll get to it,

00:35:49.936 --> 00:35:53.170
we'll talk about that,
but that's part of the humble,

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:53.610
you see?
 

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:55.675
That's part of the realism that
has to do with the comical the

00:35:55.675 --> 00:35:56.420
humble and so forth.
 

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.737
So I have been anticipating
ideas about the Renaissance and

00:36:01.737 --> 00:36:06.688
the Baroque and it is time that
we begin a more focused

00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:12.190
discussion on this period of
Western art and literature.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:15.561
It is useful to be able to
place a work like the

00:36:15.561 --> 00:36:19.268
Quixote within this period
of art and literature.

00:36:19.268 --> 00:36:23.780
It cannot be the goal of our
readings,

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:29.896
it is something that helps our
enjoyment and understanding of a

00:36:29.896 --> 00:36:34.050
book such as this,
but does not explain it away.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:38.130
Now, first, to have a clear
chronological notion,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:41.648
let us say that the Renaissance
covers from the fourteenth and

00:36:41.648 --> 00:36:44.835
fifteenth century,
and the Baroque the seventeenth

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:47.260
century and parts of the
eighteenth,

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:48.969
so we could have a scheme,
let me see,

00:36:48.969 --> 00:36:52.239
I was thinking of how to--we
can say--

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:54.969
this is all going to be very
simplistic;

00:36:54.969 --> 00:36:59.449
this is Middle Ages,
and then from the fourteenth,

00:36:59.449 --> 00:37:04.639
fifteenth--let's see if I can
make it at least readable--

00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:12.380
and sixteenth centuries,
parts of it,

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:20.936
this is the Renaissance,
and from here through the

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:28.938
eighteenth is the Baroque,
which has a further development

00:37:28.938 --> 00:37:33.110
in what is called the
Rococó.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:36.565
In one of my quotes,
then, Wellek will mention

00:37:36.565 --> 00:37:40.637
German expressionism at the
beginning of the twentieth

00:37:40.637 --> 00:37:42.324
century;
expressionism,

00:37:42.324 --> 00:37:44.179
this is so that you have an
idea.

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:50.139
Okay?
 

00:37:50.139 --> 00:37:58.561
So the Renaissance covers from
the fourteenth to the fifteenth

00:37:58.561 --> 00:38:06.846
century, and the Baroque from
the seventeenth century through

00:38:06.846 --> 00:38:09.469
the eighteenth.
 

00:38:09.469 --> 00:38:11.612
The Renaissance,
as we have seen,

00:38:11.612 --> 00:38:14.961
is the period when Western
thought breaks away from

00:38:14.961 --> 00:38:18.641
medieval ideas and practices,
which were centered on

00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:22.300
religious doctrine,
and humanists attempt to revive

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.980
the classical age,
Greek and Roman arts and ideas.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:30.353
It is a more secular period in
which Neo-Platonism is one of

00:38:30.353 --> 00:38:34.280
the principle trends of thought,
basically the idea of

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.333
perfection achieved through love
and the possibility of achieving

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:41.880
perfection by imitating the
harmonious forms of classical

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:42.449
art.
 

00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:45.918
There is an inherent optimism
in the Renaissance and in

00:38:45.918 --> 00:38:49.900
humanism in general because it
is hoped that the revival of the

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:54.132
classical past will reanimate,
revive the present and bring

00:38:54.132 --> 00:38:57.878
back a golden age,
as we saw expressed by Don

00:38:57.878 --> 00:38:59.489
Quixote's speech.
 

00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:04.108
Also there is confidence in
human agency in the ability to

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:08.969
bring about perfection to the
practice of classical norms.

00:39:08.969 --> 00:39:12.809
Utopia is one of the
Renaissance ideas and ideals

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:16.730
which gain concretion in Thomas
More's famous book

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.170
Utopia.
 

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:22.007
The perfect society is
obtainable through the

00:39:22.007 --> 00:39:24.800
application of rational norms.
 

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:28.347
There can be a perfect ruler,
as described by Machiavelli in

00:39:28.347 --> 00:39:31.036
The Prince,
and a perfect courtier,

00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:35.070
as described by Castiglione in
The Book of the Courtier,

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:40.347
and even a perfect knight,
as presented in the romances of

00:39:40.347 --> 00:39:42.878
chivalry,
fourteenth and fifteenth

00:39:42.878 --> 00:39:43.409
century.
 

00:39:43.409 --> 00:39:47.490
Nature and its representation
can be harmonious and beautiful,

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:51.639
perfect beauty is available in
nature and attainable in art.

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:53.492
The Baroque,
on the other hand,

00:39:53.492 --> 00:39:56.518
is an age in which
disappointment with these ideas

00:39:56.518 --> 00:40:00.753
and aspirations are expressed,
and the perfect forms of the

00:40:00.753 --> 00:40:05.126
Renaissance are twisted and
turned to generate a complicated

00:40:05.126 --> 00:40:09.719
convoluted form of art that has
often been seen as the blending

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:14.092
of Renaissance forms with gothic
ones by looking back to the

00:40:14.092 --> 00:40:15.500
Middle Ages.
 

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:22.233
Therefore, the Baroque would be
turning these Renaissance

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:29.809
neoclassical forms back to the
Middle Ages and to the Gothic.

00:40:29.809 --> 00:40:34.043
Think of the Gothic as the
cathedrals like that,

00:40:34.043 --> 00:40:38.460
and think of Classicism as
buildings like that.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:43.746
This is all very simplified,
but I want you to have clear

00:40:43.746 --> 00:40:47.429
ideas, which you can then
complicate.

00:40:47.429 --> 00:40:49.309
Where there is light in the
Renaissance,

00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:51.869
there is darkness,
or at least chiaroscuro,

00:40:51.869 --> 00:40:54.000
a word that I introduced you to
before,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.750
in the Baroque,
a mixture of darkness and

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:57.300
light.
 

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.054
The discussions of the priest
and the barber with Don Quixote

00:41:01.054 --> 00:41:04.309
seem to center on the
disappointments of the age,

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:08.336
along with the game of
illusions, Part II is going to

00:41:08.336 --> 00:41:11.900
be that of Baroque
desengaño,

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:16.639
a word that I mentioned before
that I'm going to mention again

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:19.360
today and discuss in some
detail.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.300
When the games prove to be
nothing more than that,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:29.242
games of illusions,
Renaissance optimism gives way

00:41:29.242 --> 00:41:32.369
to Baroque disillusionment.
 

00:41:32.369 --> 00:41:36.724
The commonplace then is that
Part I of the Quixote

00:41:36.724 --> 00:41:41.079
belongs to the Renaissance and
Part II to the Baroque.

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:43.880
Think of the two ages that
Elliott spoke about in that

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:46.099
quote that I read to you from
the book,

00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:50.789
one of imperial expansion and
another of imperial retreat.

00:41:50.789 --> 00:41:53.059
This is an over simplification,
of course,

00:41:53.059 --> 00:41:56.530
but there is enough truth in it
to merit consideration,

00:41:56.530 --> 00:42:01.349
so I will devote some time to
the concept of 'baroque' today.

00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:07.119
What is understood by 'baroque'
in general?

00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:09.150
People have a general idea,
a vague idea;

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:13.500
'this is very baroque'.
 

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.893
By that, it's something very
complicated, needlessly

00:42:15.893 --> 00:42:16.550
complicated.
 

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.570
Webster's definition is good
enough: "irregular in shape

00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.525
like some pearls [actually the
name 'baroque' comes with the

00:42:24.525 --> 00:42:29.389
names of some irregular pearls];
artistically irregular,

00:42:29.389 --> 00:42:34.967
incongruous or fantastic;
as a style of architectural and

00:42:34.967 --> 00:42:39.402
other decoration of the
seventeenth and eighteenth

00:42:39.402 --> 00:42:41.764
century;
tastelessly odd,

00:42:41.764 --> 00:42:44.239
bizarre and grotesque."
 

00:42:44.239 --> 00:42:47.190
You do not want to be called
baroque.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:52.112
Some of its features are
excessive accumulation,

00:42:52.112 --> 00:42:56.721
difficulty, obscurity and
literally darkness,

00:42:56.721 --> 00:42:59.130
chiaroscuro.
 

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:04.717
A good example is Bernini's
Saint Theresa in

00:43:04.717 --> 00:43:08.831
Ecstasy--
we have a problem of

00:43:08.831 --> 00:43:11.809
chiaroscuro here--
 

00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:20.960
 
 

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:23.789
where one sees the effects of
the spiritual or the physical,

00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:29.619
which cannot express the
sublime feeling of union with

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:30.280
God.
 

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:33.056
You can see,
she is in ecstasy,

00:43:33.056 --> 00:43:38.610
and the folds of her clothing
express this sublime feeling of

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.711
union,
clothing expressing mood by its

00:43:41.711 --> 00:43:43.322
folds,
body covered,

00:43:43.322 --> 00:43:46.210
except for the hand and the
foot--

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.559
I can't see the foot there--and
the face,

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:52.349
of course, in that moment of
ecstasy.

00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:57.260
This is certainly not a
Renaissance statue,

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:02.211
think of Michelangelo's
David or something like

00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:04.737
that,
this is, not because of its

00:44:04.737 --> 00:44:07.606
twists,
and folds, and so forth,

00:44:07.606 --> 00:44:11.360
this is a Bernini statue,
typical of the Baroque.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:16.472
Another good example is Antonio
Pereda's The Cavalier's

00:44:16.472 --> 00:44:20.829
Dream,
where the ephemeral nature of

00:44:20.829 --> 00:44:24.980
the real is emphasized,
and, of course,

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:30.018
the Baroque emphasizes images
of death and of decay,

00:44:30.018 --> 00:44:37.050
so his dream turns into a
theater, death,

00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.670
books and so forth.
 

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:48.210
This is a baroque dream that
this cavalier is having.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:51.041
His name is,
by the way, Antonio Pereda,

00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:53.510
and the previous one is
Bernini.

00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:57.896
So I wanted you to have those,
but I'm going to give you some

00:44:57.896 --> 00:45:00.750
more examples that are close at
hand.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:07.050
So let me comment on a few
quotations on the Baroque.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:12.271
The first one is from
José Arrom who was also a

00:45:12.271 --> 00:45:15.820
professor at Yale for many
years,

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:20.097
a Yalie and a professor,
he died about two years ago at

00:45:20.097 --> 00:45:22.079
age about ninety-eight.
 

00:45:22.079 --> 00:45:26.621
He wrote: "It is generally
agreed today that the Baroque

00:45:26.621 --> 00:45:30.936
was in Europe an artistic
climate created by the spiritual

00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:33.889
climate of the Counter
Reformation.

00:45:33.889 --> 00:45:35.570
[Now you know what the Counter
Reformation is,

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:38.072
having read Elliott,
that movement in Spain that

00:45:38.072 --> 00:45:40.789
countered the Reformation in the
rest of Europe,

00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:43.929
mostly Germany,
the Council of Trent,

00:45:43.929 --> 00:45:44.940
and all of that.
 

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.268
I go on with Arrom].
 

00:45:46.268 --> 00:45:51.063
This climate acted like an
obscure force that pushed toward

00:45:51.063 --> 00:45:56.106
a return to what was before the
eruption of the Renaissance [a

00:45:56.106 --> 00:46:00.983
return back to the Middle Ages]
to jump back to grounds that

00:46:00.983 --> 00:46:06.440
because they had not been turned
appeared to be more secure.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:09.280
In this jump back,
Europeans constrained by the

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.047
landscape of their own history,
fell on to intellectual and

00:46:13.047 --> 00:46:16.693
artistic currents that were
aesthetically akin to the Gothic

00:46:16.693 --> 00:46:20.030
and intellectually to the Middle
Ages [the Gothic,

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:25.601
my depiction there of the
Gothic cathedral]."

00:46:25.601 --> 00:46:26.739
Unquote.
 

00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:29.510
In Spain, the renewal of
scholastic thought and the

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:32.670
retrenchment brought about by
the Counter Reformation,

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:39.230
in general, signifies this,
and lead towards the Baroque,

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.061
because there can be,
of course, no return in

00:46:41.061 --> 00:46:43.467
history,
and what turns out is something

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:47.065
completely new the mixture,
the very uneasy mixture of

00:46:47.065 --> 00:46:49.730
Renaissance forms with Medieval
ones,

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.159
and that turns out to be the
Baroque.

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:54.630
I hope you follow this back and
forth.

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:59.289
The next quote is from
René Wellek--

00:46:59.289 --> 00:47:04.487
whom I mentioned before,
a great professor of

00:47:04.487 --> 00:47:10.405
comparative literature here,
of Czech origin--the concept of

00:47:10.405 --> 00:47:12.880
Baroque and literary
scholarship;

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.264
this is a little denser because
it has to do with the critical

00:47:17.264 --> 00:47:21.719
concept of the Baroque but I
want you to have an idea of it.

00:47:21.719 --> 00:47:25.548
Wellek traces the development
of the term 'baroque,' above

00:47:25.548 --> 00:47:28.572
all, its transfer from art
history to literary

00:47:28.572 --> 00:47:29.849
historiography.
 

00:47:29.849 --> 00:47:34.719
The term "baroque"
began as a term in art history.

00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:38.894
He links the dissemination of
the concept to use that Oswald

00:47:38.894 --> 00:47:43.000
Spengler makes of it in The
Decline of the West--

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.449
The Decline of the West
by Oswald Spengler was a very,

00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:50.389
very important book in the
twentieth century,

00:47:50.389 --> 00:48:01.599
late teens early twenties,
early twentieth century,

00:48:01.599 --> 00:48:03.429
The Decline of the West.
 

00:48:03.429 --> 00:48:05.998
It was a book that was misused
by the Nazis and so forth,

00:48:05.998 --> 00:48:07.099
but was very powerful.
 

00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:10.559
I see it as a synthesis of
Hegel and Nietzsche,

00:48:10.559 --> 00:48:14.610
but that's too much to explain
today--

00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:18.922
and the relationship
established with expressionism

00:48:18.922 --> 00:48:22.719
at the beginning of the
twentieth century.

00:48:22.719 --> 00:48:27.224
Wellek thinks that the
popularity of the baroque came

00:48:27.224 --> 00:48:30.690
because critics saw an
expressionism,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.322
which is a kind of poetry in
Germany at the beginning of the

00:48:33.322 --> 00:48:35.023
twentieth century,
in the 1920s,

00:48:35.023 --> 00:48:37.260
a very convoluted complicated
poetry;

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:42.440
they saw that as a kind of
return to the baroque.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:49.534
I hope this very crude drawing
of mine can help you visualize

00:48:49.534 --> 00:48:51.190
all of this.
 

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:56.326
Wellek distinguishes between
those who want to turn baroque

00:48:56.326 --> 00:49:00.123
into a typology;
that is, that the whole of art

00:49:00.123 --> 00:49:04.456
history is a back and forth
between Renaissance and Baroque,

00:49:04.456 --> 00:49:07.728
Renaissance and Baroque;
it's like others who have tried

00:49:07.728 --> 00:49:09.931
to turn all of literary history
to Romanticism and the

00:49:09.931 --> 00:49:11.969
Enlightenment,
Romanticism and Neo-Classicism;

00:49:11.969 --> 00:49:14.599
he is against all of those.
 

00:49:14.599 --> 00:49:19.965
And, this is the most important
quote, and let me see if I can

00:49:19.965 --> 00:49:24.275
unpack it for you,
the word here that is important

00:49:24.275 --> 00:49:26.650
is that big word there.
 

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.050
What does synesthesia
mean?

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:35.211
Synesthesia means to
express one sense through

00:49:35.211 --> 00:49:38.447
another;
that is, when you say it's a

00:49:38.447 --> 00:49:41.170
blue sound, that's a
synesthesia;

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:45.036
or a shrill color,
shrill is sound and you apply

00:49:45.036 --> 00:49:48.081
it to color,
that is synesthesia,

00:49:48.081 --> 00:49:51.505
it's a combination of
sensations from various senses

00:49:51.505 --> 00:49:53.250
used one for the other.
 

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:54.780
You understand what I'm trying
to say?

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.309
Is that clear? Okay.
 

00:49:56.309 --> 00:50:00.202
"For many other writers it
would be possible to see an

00:50:00.202 --> 00:50:04.230
indubitable connection between
the emblematic image and their

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:07.922
belief in the pervasive
parallelism between microcosm or

00:50:07.922 --> 00:50:11.949
macrocosm in some vast system of
correspondences which can be

00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:14.969
expressed only by sensuous
symbolism.

00:50:14.969 --> 00:50:18.596
The prevalence of synesthesia,
which in the Renaissance occurs

00:50:18.596 --> 00:50:21.806
only under such traditional
figures as the music of the

00:50:21.806 --> 00:50:24.753
spheres,
but during the Baroque boldly

00:50:24.753 --> 00:50:29.027
hears colors and sees sounds is
another indication of this

00:50:29.027 --> 00:50:33.449
belief in a multiple web of
interrelation correspondences in

00:50:33.449 --> 00:50:35.250
the universe."
 

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.889
What this means is the
following.

00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:42.152
In the Baroque there is an
attempt to reconstitute the kind

00:50:42.152 --> 00:50:46.416
of unified conception of the
universe that was prevalent in

00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:49.750
the Middle Ages,
and that you see in Dante,

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.780
and that you see in the gothic
cathedrals,

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.300
all centered on the figure of
the Christian God,

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:59.735
and in all symbolism,
everything connected to it in a

00:50:59.735 --> 00:51:03.150
very harmonious and satisfying
whole,

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:05.079
where everything has a meaning
and a place.

00:51:05.079 --> 00:51:09.583
In the Baroque,
this set of correspondences

00:51:09.583 --> 00:51:12.760
tries--
the writers and the artists try

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.969
to reconstruct this set of
correspondences,

00:51:15.969 --> 00:51:18.405
but this is a world that is no
longer centered--

00:51:18.405 --> 00:51:21.050
remember?--it's a world that is
post-Copernican,

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:25.396
and it's a world during which
Galileo is producing his

00:51:25.396 --> 00:51:28.530
theories,
so it's a de-centered world.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.369
So the Baroque is an effort,
through synesthesia--

00:51:31.369 --> 00:51:34.579
that is, to express the
correspondences between colors,

00:51:34.579 --> 00:51:41.164
and sounds, and so forth--to
reconstruct through art that set

00:51:41.164 --> 00:51:46.599
of correspondences,
that harmonious world that is

00:51:46.599 --> 00:51:50.125
no longer available,
and this is what gives the

00:51:50.125 --> 00:51:51.170
Baroque this tension.
 

00:51:51.170 --> 00:52:01.027
The way that I explain the
Renaissance and Baroque is:

00:52:01.027 --> 00:52:09.764
think of Beinecke Plaza,
Beinecke Plaza with its columns

00:52:09.764 --> 00:52:13.960
is like the Renaissance,
only that it is an eighteenth

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:16.561
century kind of Neo-Classicism,
but think of it,

00:52:16.561 --> 00:52:19.650
it is that kind of classical
shape.

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:25.498
Sterling Memorial Library is
Gothic, Neo-Gothic;

00:52:25.498 --> 00:52:26.369
okay?
 

00:52:26.369 --> 00:52:27.210
Neo-Gothic.
 

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.793
I often say that the McDonald's
arch is more genuine than our

00:52:31.793 --> 00:52:34.594
Neo-Gothic,
but nevertheless it's

00:52:34.594 --> 00:52:38.693
Neo-Gothic, and so the Baroque
would be a very forced

00:52:38.693 --> 00:52:43.739
combination of Beinecke Plaza
and Sterling Memorial Library,

00:52:43.739 --> 00:52:47.119
that would be the Baroque.
 

00:52:47.119 --> 00:52:53.559
Now, the Baroque now in Parts I
and II of the Quixote;

00:52:53.559 --> 00:52:57.889
we have spoken about Baroque
elements in Part I,

00:52:57.889 --> 00:53:03.539
particularly the grotesque in
characters like Maritornes,

00:53:03.539 --> 00:53:06.927
the play of illusion and
reality and the multiplicity of

00:53:06.927 --> 00:53:10.318
fictional levels,
the chiaroscuro of the

00:53:10.318 --> 00:53:13.670
episodes in the inn and the
knight himself,

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.090
who is a combination of things,
a grotesque combination.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:22.507
But Part I still contains many
elements of what could still be

00:53:22.507 --> 00:53:25.349
called Renaissance aesthetics.
 

00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:29.047
This is so particularly in
characters such as Marcela and

00:53:29.047 --> 00:53:32.813
Dorotea, whose beauty and
perfections reflect Neo-Platonic

00:53:32.813 --> 00:53:33.539
ideals.
 

00:53:33.539 --> 00:53:36.650
The same is true of some of the
settings,

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:39.074
particularly the locus
amoenus that I have

00:53:39.074 --> 00:53:42.592
mentioned several times,
where Dorotea appears washing

00:53:42.592 --> 00:53:45.322
her feet,
in an episode in which the

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:49.219
classical background seems to be
derived from Ovid,

00:53:49.219 --> 00:53:52.739
as Tony reminded me once and I
didn't give him credit for.

00:53:52.739 --> 00:53:57.556
This is an Ovidian scene,
and the rewriting of classical

00:53:57.556 --> 00:54:01.146
models is very much a
Renaissance feature,

00:54:01.146 --> 00:54:02.460
by the way.
 

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.623
Nature present,
because so much of Part I takes

00:54:05.623 --> 00:54:09.340
place outdoors appears to be
plentiful and orderly,

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:13.657
except when Rocinante gets a
sudden and unexpected sexual

00:54:13.657 --> 00:54:17.690
urge and provokes a row,
as we remember.

00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:21.226
There is also a kind of
underlying sense of optimism and

00:54:21.226 --> 00:54:24.358
mirth in Part I,
even when Don Quixote is

00:54:24.358 --> 00:54:28.815
returned home in a cage which
had something carnivalesque

00:54:28.815 --> 00:54:32.081
about it--
remember that he gets home on a

00:54:32.081 --> 00:54:34.298
Sundayâ€“and,
after all, of the various

00:54:34.298 --> 00:54:37.061
amorous conflicts are resolved,
except for the last one,

00:54:37.061 --> 00:54:41.099
whose resolution is not clear
because it's still going on.

00:54:41.099 --> 00:54:44.079
Dorotea is betrothed to
Fernando, and Lucinda to

00:54:44.079 --> 00:54:47.057
Cardenio, the captive is going
to marry Zoraida,

00:54:47.057 --> 00:54:49.150
Luis and Clara,
and so forth.

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.525
Don Quixote's interventions
have an affirmative effect in

00:54:52.525 --> 00:54:54.945
the end,
the common place about this is

00:54:54.945 --> 00:54:58.460
that Renaissance aesthetics are
based on an idea of order,

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:02.423
symmetry, and perfection
obtained by the imitation of

00:55:02.423 --> 00:55:06.693
classical models and the
striving for humanely attainable

00:55:06.693 --> 00:55:09.608
goals: human agency,
self fashioning,

00:55:09.608 --> 00:55:12.134
straight angles,
horizontal lines meeting

00:55:12.134 --> 00:55:14.710
vertical ones,
ordered repetition in the

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:15.230
columns.
 

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:18.427
All of these are Renaissance
features, the repetition of all

00:55:18.427 --> 00:55:20.650
of these stories is like those
columns.

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:24.934
Part II, however,
is going to be much more

00:55:24.934 --> 00:55:25.980
Baroque.
 

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:29.061
I have already said that much
of it takes place within

00:55:29.061 --> 00:55:31.619
buildings and that it is
generally darker.

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:34.135
There is a chiaroscuro
quality to it,

00:55:34.135 --> 00:55:37.003
and the chiaroscuro, as
I have been saying,

00:55:37.003 --> 00:55:38.760
is typical of the Baroque.
 

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.510
There are more grotesque
elements made up of the

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:43.969
disparate, the contrasting and
the ugly.

00:55:43.969 --> 00:55:47.088
Here, the key figure,
about which I will be speaking

00:55:47.088 --> 00:55:49.230
in other classes,
is the monster.

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:53.655
It is going to take place--Part
II is going to take place not in

00:55:53.655 --> 00:55:57.097
inns or in nature,
but in lavish country and urban

00:55:57.097 --> 00:55:57.869
houses.
 

00:55:57.869 --> 00:56:02.889
The Baroque tends to be built
up, to be complex.

00:56:02.889 --> 00:56:08.280
In Part II we have not so much
nature as architecture or what I

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:13.150
like to call arch-texture,
a texture that is intensified,

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:15.500
therefore arch-texture.
 

00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:19.847
The multiplicity of fictional
levels is going to increase by

00:56:19.847 --> 00:56:24.268
the fact that the characters now
know and discuss Part I,

00:56:24.268 --> 00:56:26.579
and by the appearance of
Avellaneda's apocryphal

00:56:26.579 --> 00:56:30.610
Quixote, a central theme,
a narrative device of Part II

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.880
is going to be
desengaño,

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:37.467
disillusionment,
which could be the overarching

00:56:37.467 --> 00:56:40.119
direction and shape of the plot.
 

00:56:40.119 --> 00:56:44.579
In fact, one could say that the
whole of Part II is leading to

00:56:44.579 --> 00:56:46.480
desengaño.
 

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.938
This is going to be the end of
Part II and

00:56:49.938 --> 00:56:54.326
desengaño is
perhaps the most important

00:56:54.326 --> 00:56:57.280
element of the Spanish Baroque.
 

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:02.682
I am going to leave it there,
except to point out that I have

00:57:02.682 --> 00:57:08.356
given you in the handout with a
map of Spain behind you will see

00:57:08.356 --> 00:57:13.760
a quote from Gracián,
El Criticón,

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.960
which is the definition of
desengaño that I

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.420
am going to begin the next
lecture with,

00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:24.559
as I apply it to the evolution,
the unfolding of the plot of

00:57:24.559 --> 00:57:26.389
the Quixote.
 

00:57:26.389 --> 00:57:32.000

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.867
PAUL FREEDMAN:Gregory
of Tours.

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:11.200
Here we enter further into
a stranger world.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.533
As I told you at the outset of
the course, it begins fairly

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:19.033
reasonably, as if it's another
history course with great

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:24.633
powers, states, recognizable
theories of government, and

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:26.800
practices of government.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.067
Now we're into what certainly
seems like a combination of

00:00:31.067 --> 00:00:33.700
thugs and miracles.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:40.500
And I hope that you'll see, if
you haven't seen already, that

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
far from being contradictory,
thugs and miracles go

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.233
together, historically.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:49.867
We've already entered
into a somewhat

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.267
strange realm with Procopius.

00:00:53.267 --> 00:01:00.700
Procopius' Secret History
certainly is a strange story,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.600
with strange theories of
causality and a strange cast

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.667
of characters.

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:11.967
But it is narrated in a
high classical style.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.667
Insofar as the pieces are a bit
jumbled, it's because it

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.467
wasn't completed.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:22.800
But as you will have seen, if
you think about Procopius, he

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.133
is easy to read because
he's leading you on.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:31.200
He has several points to make,
and he makes them with great

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.700
rhetorical power.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.533
His Secret History is
in the classical

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.067
tradition of the invective.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:44.933
And in a way, we are better
able to understand this

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:48.733
because our own political
discourse has gotten much more

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:55.300
crude and extreme in the last
thirty years or so.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.033
So political invective,
historical invective,

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.567
stylistically well - composed,
is not unfamiliar to us.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.600
But Gregory of Tours is.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.700
In a way, I've cheated by giving
you the assignment from

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.300
this edition of Alexander
Murray, because he rearranges

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.100
and excerpts things.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.400
The full work is much fatter,
and Murray tries to make the

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.067
story fairly coherent with
headings, grouping things

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:33.167
together, explaining a little
what's going on, to say

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:35.700
nothing of the nice maps
and genealogical

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.300
tables in the back.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.700
But that loses some of
the random quality--

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.767
or seemingly random quality--

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:47.667
that Gregory has.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:54.367
He has this funny way of seeming
to move from one thing

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:57.200
to another without any
kind of transition or

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.867
for no apparent purpose.

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:04.867
So in one of the little sections
of Book 3 that's not

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:14.567
in Murray, he's telling us
now we have a miracle.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:17.767
"There lived at the city of
Langres, Saint Gregory, that

00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:20.300
priest of God famed far and
wide for his miracles and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.567
virtuous deeds.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.000
While I am talking about this
bishop, I thought you would

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.233
like me to tell you something of
the town of Dijon, where he

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.100
spent his youth." Well,
wait a minute.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.833
Did I ask about Dijon?

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:35.233
Do I even know where Dijon is?

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:39.333
Weren't we talking about
Theuderic and Chlothar and

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.400
their feud?

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.000
How have we gotten into, first
of all, a story of a saint,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.700
and second, a little travelogue
about Dijon?

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.767
So that is Gregory.

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:50.433
You've got to like this.

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:55.767
And I think we are better
equipped you, especially--

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:59.733
because we're not so linear
as we used to be.

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:03.633
You know, magazines used to be
just a set of articles, and

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:04.300
that was it.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.033
And then about twenty years
ago, they started just

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.600
breaking up into these
miscellaneous things with

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
little observations, and here's
what's happening in

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.033
Wichita Falls.

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.733
But, you know, I don't
live there.

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:16.567
But so what?

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:22.633
You know, food festival in
Colorado Springs, and what

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.700
about this train trip
in New Zealand?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.767
Well, I'm not in New
Zealand, either.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:27.333
You know what I mean.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.700
This kind of little offers
from all over the place,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.300
little possibilities,
observations, wit and wisdom.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.467
This is the experience
of modern media.

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:42.033
So I wouldn't say that Gregory
is ahead of his time, but I

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:44.067
don't want you to
complain to me--

00:04:44.067 --> 00:04:47.600
well, I mean, you can, but
I will not be incredibly

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.667
sympathetic with, "Wait, I don't
know where this stops

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:55.067
and begins." Or "Wait, are we
responsible for Theodebert

00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:58.933
versus Theuderic?" The answer to
that is "No." I'm not going

00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:06.067
to give you a short answer about
which of these names is

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:07.667
best for your cat.

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:12.167
PROFESSOR: Or, you
know, name at least five

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:15.067
of Clovis' grandchildren.

00:05:15.067 --> 00:05:24.767
But the rhythm of this, the
power of these rulers, their

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:30.433
thuggery or their violence,
their internecine violence,

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:35.267
their respect for miracles,
Gregory's sense of God's

00:05:35.267 --> 00:05:38.767
intervention, is very
important to grasp.

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:41.500
And we will talk about the
actual historical importance

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.333
of this people that Gregory
chronicles, the Franks.

00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:50.567
The chief thing about the Franks
from Gregory's point of

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:54.800
view is that they are
Catholic Christians.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.633
They never--

00:05:55.633 --> 00:06:00.100
unlike almost all other of the
invaders of the Roman Empire--

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.467
they never go through a
period of Arianism.

00:06:03.467 --> 00:06:09.633
Clovis converts from paganism
to regular-guy Roman

00:06:09.633 --> 00:06:11.267
Christianity.

00:06:11.267 --> 00:06:14.400
And from Clovis' point of view,
that is what is of chief

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.767
importance--

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:18.900
from Gregory's point of view.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.833
Gregory of Tours, the author,
is writing in

00:06:22.833 --> 00:06:25.167
the late sixth century.

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.300
So around the same time,
a few decades later,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.133
perhaps, than Procopius.

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:35.400
Gregory lived from 539 to 594.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.867
In his time, there was still a
distinction between Romans and

00:06:39.867 --> 00:06:43.500
barbarians, and Gregory
was very conscious of

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.067
himself as a Roman.

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:49.900
He was from a distinguished
Roman senatorial family.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.467
Note that he uses the word
"senatorial," a rank of the

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:59.233
Roman Empire, even though the
Roman Empire, from our point

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:02.067
of view, certainly hasn't
existed for a

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:04.500
hundred years or so.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.867
He notes that eighteen bishops
of Tours, his see--

00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:12.500
of the eighteen bishops of
Tours, all but five were

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.400
related to him.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:21.400
That shows you that being a
bishop was a Roman office, an

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.733
elite Roman office, even in
the barbarian period.

00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:29.633
And also you'll see that
Gregory's behavior shows us

00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:33.400
that the bishops, to some
extent, have inherited Roman

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.800
offices and Roman
responsibilities.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.433
They are part of the government,
and in a sense,

00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:46.533
opposed to the more brutal
aspects of Merovingian,

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.033
Frankish government.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.867
Gregory became bishop of Tours
in 573, and so he was bishop

00:07:54.867 --> 00:07:57.000
for twenty-one years.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.633
He probably began writing
this book--

00:08:00.633 --> 00:08:03.333
which is actually just called
The Book of the Histories--

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:04.867
shortly after his election.

00:08:04.867 --> 00:08:11.900
So he's writing in the
570s to early 590s.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.000
He begins Book 1, which we
haven't read, with the story

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.167
of creation and takes it to the
death of Saint Martin, the

00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:23.800
great patron of Tours.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600
And then he begins, properly
speaking, with at least the

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.167
legendary history of the dynasty
of the Frankish kings,

00:08:30.167 --> 00:08:35.367
the descendants of a certain
Merovech, hence Merovingians,

00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:38.633
the name for this dynasty.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:41.800
Gregory also wrote a
number of saints'

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.500
lives and martyr stories.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.800
He was very attached
to Saint Martin.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.000
At one point, in one of those
episodes not in Murray, he

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.167
says, "If you celebrate the
feast of Saint Martin

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:56.600
faithfully, you will gain the
protection of the saintly

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.000
bishop in this world
and the next." And

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
indeed, that's very important.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.367
Remember when Clovis--

00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:09.700
and this is in Murray,
on the page 17--

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.800
when Clovis decides he's going
to attack the Visigoths?

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.133
Now, he says he's attacking them
because he can't stand to

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:22.333
have Arians occupying Gaul,
which is on page 16.

00:09:22.333 --> 00:09:24.600
"Then Clovis said to his men,
'I take it very badly that

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.233
these Arians hold
part of Gaul.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.400
With God's help, let's go and
conquer them, and bring the

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.467
land under His authority." And
a soldier seizes hay from a

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.100
poor peasant.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.400
This is just the way
soldiers are.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.733
They need that hay, the civilian
has the hay, they're

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:46.100
on the march, he grabs it.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:53.767
But this peasant is on the lands
of Saint Martin, of land

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.267
belonging to Tours.

00:09:56.267 --> 00:10:01.433
And the king, thug though he is,
has issued an order saying

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:04.767
the troops were not
to take anything

00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:06.400
except fodder and water.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.433
And in fact, sort of
hay is fodder.

00:10:09.433 --> 00:10:14.900
Nevertheless, "the king, who
quicker than it takes to say

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:22.233
it, had him put to the sword."
Guy, you've made a mistake.

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.500
And he's killed.

00:10:25.633 --> 00:10:29.767
And Clovis says of this
incident, "How shall there be

00:10:29.767 --> 00:10:35.233
hope of victory, if we offend
the blessed Martin?"

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:38.100
So you've got to take seriously,
if you want to call

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.767
it superstition, fine.

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:45.100
But the Frankish rulers are at
least amenable to influence

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:49.400
from the priests, bishops,
guardians of the saints.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.000
And notice--

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.133
because we're going to come
back to this a lot.

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:56.933
You're going to see it
everywhere in the early Middle

00:10:56.933 --> 00:10:58.867
Ages, post-Roman world--

00:10:58.867 --> 00:11:01.467
the saint is not dead.

00:11:01.467 --> 00:11:05.600
It's not like Martin is some
just kind of presence, the

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:13.600
way, you know, the happy dead
who are indifferent to us.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.400
Martin is an angry saint,
or potentially angry.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.767
In fact, all saints worth
anything in the early Middle

00:11:20.767 --> 00:11:24.800
Ages are very touchy.

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:29.200
If you seize hay from land
belonging to their church,

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.367
they'll strike you dead, or they
will see to it that you

00:11:32.367 --> 00:11:34.400
die in battle.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.500
And Gregory is indeed full of
incidents in which holy

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:45.133
figures, alive or dead, have
this kind of ability to

00:11:45.133 --> 00:11:48.100
mobilize supernatural power.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.733
What is his historical model?

00:11:56.733 --> 00:12:02.067
I mean if Procopius, in The
Wars, models himself after

00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:06.133
Thucydides, and if in the
Secret History he models

00:12:06.133 --> 00:12:09.233
himself after a tradition
of invective, what

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:11.533
is Gregory's model?

00:12:11.533 --> 00:12:13.200
We don't really know
his sources.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.633
One reason why he's so important
is that for an awful

00:12:16.633 --> 00:12:19.467
lot of the history of the
Merovingians, he's about all

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:23.400
we have. And although
disorganized--

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.933
quote "disorganized"--

00:12:24.933 --> 00:12:28.367
from our point of view,
he's very detailed.

00:12:28.367 --> 00:12:32.333
But he does have a model, and
that model is the Bible, the

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:35.667
Hebrew Bible or the
Old Testament.

00:12:35.667 --> 00:12:40.367
If you read the Old Testament,
it is, as I think I've said

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:44.933
before, full of violence
and full of miracles.

00:12:47.867 --> 00:12:50.133
And they are sort
of jumbled up.

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:55.233
The hand of God is very
apparent in the Bible.

00:12:55.233 --> 00:12:59.367
And generally speaking, those
who disobey God are punished.

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:07.233
The same is true in Gregory,
although the hand of God is a

00:13:07.233 --> 00:13:10.800
little more mediated by
those holy figures--

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:13.800
saints, hermits, bishops--

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.000
that we just discussed.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.600
There is a little bit more of
a priestly power, but then

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.167
again, the Bible has figures
like Moses, who are able to--

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:31.167
Joshua, who's able
to stop the sun.

00:13:31.167 --> 00:13:32.400
Priestly figures, indeed.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:39.133
So from Gregory's point of view,
there is a continuity

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:43.467
between biblical history and
the history of his times.

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:48.500
He describes, in the prologue
to Book 2--

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.767
which is not in Murray--

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:55.100
that his plan is to describe the
holy deeds of the saints

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.800
and the way in which
whole races

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.800
of people were butchered.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.067
OK, you got a problem
with that?

00:14:03.067 --> 00:14:05.300
At least the second part
we all know is

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.100
what history's about.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.400
It's the first that's a
little tough, the holy

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.600
deeds of the saints.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.533
And particularly as they're
not off on the side.

00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:21.567
The popular imagination loves
what might be called "holy

00:14:21.567 --> 00:14:27.300
deeds of the saints." If you
look at gossip magazines of

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:35.167
the lower sort, or kind of
internet folklore, weird

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:43.000
births, raining frogs, space
aliens all sorts of

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.267
supernatural events clog them.

00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:49.967
Along with stars--

00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:55.367
that is, movie stars or media
stars gossip, and a little bit

00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:59.900
of history, a little bit
of current events.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.633
This is not so dissimilar,
in that sense.

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:12.300
Gregory is both a historian
and a political actor.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.033
He does not have either the
luxury or the irrelevance of

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:21.067
most historians now, who
sit comfortably--

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.733
or in my case, not very
comfortably, since I'm in an

00:15:23.733 --> 00:15:26.600
unrenovated office-- but
comfortably enough.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.767
PROFESSOR: In universities and
maybe comment

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:31.567
on what's going on.

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:32.033
No.

00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:37.867
Gregory is very, very involved
with the Merovingian rulers.

00:15:37.867 --> 00:15:41.300
And he has to display courage.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.100
He refuses to surrender
fugitives who have sought

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.267
asylum in his cathedral
when they are

00:15:47.267 --> 00:15:50.200
demanded by royal officials.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.467
He defends his fellow bishop,
Praetextatus, who was accused

00:15:54.467 --> 00:15:55.733
by the king of treason.

00:15:55.733 --> 00:15:58.500
You'll be reading about
this for next week.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.800
He'll have arguments, again in
your reading for next week,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.533
with the king himself about the
Trinity, and has to defend

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:11.767
himself against the charge
of slandering the king's

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:12.633
concubine--

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:15.033
really, here, the word
"concubine" isn't quite right,

00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:17.267
because these kings are
kind of polygamists--

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:21.300
against the king's favorite,
Fredegund.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:25.267
And Gregory is tried
for defaming her.

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:26.500
He resists taxes.

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:31.433
He seems to have been
a small man.

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:34.800
He suffered ill health, or at
least he took an inordinate

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.500
interest in his own health.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.500
He was a great believer in
potions made with dust from

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.700
the relics and tombs
of holy men.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:53.533
A medicine prescribed as potio
de pulvere sepulchre, a potion

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:56.933
made from sepulcher dust. But
it's got to be of the right

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.167
kind of people.

00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.267
What is his attitude
towards the Franks?

00:17:04.267 --> 00:17:09.033
I've said he regards them
as thugs and barbarians.

00:17:09.033 --> 00:17:12.667
But at the same time, he regards
them as the people of

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:18.367
Israel, reborn as a race
favored by God.

00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:23.367
The Franks claimed--

00:17:23.367 --> 00:17:26.333
or at least their spokespersons,
their learned

00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:27.167
spokespersons--

00:17:27.167 --> 00:17:33.633
claimed to be descended from
refugees of fallen Troy.

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.367
Thus, like the Romans.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.633
In fact, we don't really know
anything about them until they

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:43.167
appear in Roman sources
in the third century.

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.567
We don't know what held
them together.

00:17:47.567 --> 00:17:50.200
We're back to this problem
of ethnogenesis.

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.133
Do they speak a common
language?

00:17:52.133 --> 00:17:54.733
Do they just travel in
a pack together?

00:17:54.733 --> 00:17:57.733
Do they regard themselves
as a people

00:17:57.733 --> 00:17:59.133
having a common ancestor?

00:17:59.133 --> 00:18:00.500
Well, we don't really know.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.367
Constantine's father, at the
end of the third century,

00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:11.933
dealt with them and settled
them in what's now the Low

00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:14.367
Countries, Holland
and Belgium.

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:18.533
They were federati, which you
remember means allied armies

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.733
of the Empire.

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:24.600
They served the Empire actually
fairly loyally in the

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.700
early fourth century, and they
became rich doing so.

00:18:32.533 --> 00:18:37.133
We don't really know if the
supposed ancestors of Clovis--

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.267
Merovech himself,
for example--

00:18:39.267 --> 00:18:42.500
were real or legendary.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.833
Supposedly, Merovech is
Clovis' grandfather.

00:18:44.833 --> 00:18:46.300
We don't know if he existed.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.133
But we do know something about
his father, Chilperic.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.033
Well, it's a chalkless day, so
the guy's name is Chilperic.

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:04.433
C-H-I-L-P-E-R-I-C. We know about
him because his grave

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:07.200
was dug up in the seventeenth
century.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.033
Unfortunately, all the stuff
that was in his grave, most of

00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:15.400
it was stolen in 1831.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:22.767
But drawings had been made
before that, and they show

00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:26.767
that he owned or was buried with
a cloak embroidered with

00:19:26.767 --> 00:19:31.367
cicadas, a crystal
globe, a gold

00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:33.800
bracelet, a Frankish amulet.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.100
His horse's--we assume it was
his horse's head buried with

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:44.067
him, and it was covered
with precious metal.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:46.333
He was also buried with
100 gold coins

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:48.233
and 200 silver ones.

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:52.967
And a signet ring that shows
him with long hair, and the

00:19:52.967 --> 00:19:54.133
ring is inscribed--

00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:56.067
in case we wondered
who this was--

00:19:56.067 --> 00:19:58.133
King Chilperic.

00:19:58.133 --> 00:19:59.867
The long hair is important.

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:04.133
It is a symbol of the power
of these rulers.

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:07.100
It is a kind of dynastic
charisma.

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:12.000
And indeed, one of the best
books about these rulers, by

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.733
an English historian is called
Long Haired Kings.

00:20:19.133 --> 00:20:20.467
What is all this stuff?

00:20:20.467 --> 00:20:22.333
The stuff that's buried
with him?

00:20:22.333 --> 00:20:25.000
A lot of it comes
from Byzantium.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:34.000
A lot of this would have been
bribes or goodwill gestures by

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:41.067
the emperors interested in
keeping some nominal loyalty

00:20:41.067 --> 00:20:46.500
on the part of the barbarian
tribes in the collapse of the

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.767
Western Empire.

00:20:50.233 --> 00:20:54.067
Clovis succeeded Chilperic,
his father, as the head of

00:20:54.067 --> 00:20:58.300
this federated tribe of now
a nonexistent empire.

00:21:01.367 --> 00:21:08.300
All that remains of the Empire
is a Roman commander.

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:15.100
Remember we mentioned, in the
life of Saint Antoninus of

00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:20.233
Noricum that an emissary was
sent from the Roman army to

00:21:20.233 --> 00:21:22.600
try to get paid and discovered
that the

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.000
Empire no longer existed.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.367
That there was nobody
to pay them.

00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:31.600
Syagrius, S-Y-A-G-R-I-U-S, is
a little bit like this.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.067
He's a general in northern Gaul
of the Roman Empire, and

00:21:36.067 --> 00:21:37.733
now that the Roman
Empire ceases to

00:21:37.733 --> 00:21:39.700
exist, he's on his own.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.333
And he is a rival for Clovis,
and one of the first targets

00:21:44.333 --> 00:21:47.433
of his expansion.

00:21:47.433 --> 00:21:52.867
Gregory calls him "king of the
Romans." What does that mean?

00:21:52.867 --> 00:21:54.967
Rome didn't have king's.

00:21:54.967 --> 00:21:57.600
We don't really know
what title he used.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.133
We have no documents
from him, no coins.

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:04.700
Probably Byzantium, the eastern
Roman Empire, didn't

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:07.433
like him, and probably they
supported Clovis.

00:22:07.433 --> 00:22:15.333
At any rate, he was killed in
486, and Clovis' next target

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:18.733
of expansion was the Visigoths,
those Arians that

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:21.933
Gregory tells us about in the
passage that I mentioned to

00:22:21.933 --> 00:22:24.300
you just a little while ago.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.533
What kind of personality
does Clovis have?

00:22:32.433 --> 00:22:33.867
Have we met his type before?

00:22:33.867 --> 00:22:35.400
Is there any difference?

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.367
Anybody have a sense of him?

00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:44.467
How does he strike you?

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:47.367
Just another one of these
characters of the early Middle

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.167
Ages, or is there's
something unusual?

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.467
STUDENT: Killing off everybody,
including his

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:55.467
family members?

00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:57.400
PROFESSOR: He kills off
everybody, including

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.667
his family members.

00:22:58.667 --> 00:23:00.300
Yeah, yeah.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.267
This is, unfortunately,
not unusual.

00:23:03.267 --> 00:23:05.367
And why?

00:23:05.367 --> 00:23:07.433
STUDENT: He doesn't want
any family member

00:23:07.433 --> 00:23:09.033
to lay claim to--

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:10.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
wouldn't you think he'd be

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:15.467
dynastically conscious?

00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:17.867
Constantius, the Emperor in the
fourth century, did the

00:23:17.867 --> 00:23:19.400
same thing.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.633
Only his nephews, Gallus and
Julian, survived, and indeed,

00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:23.900
Julian defeated him.

00:23:32.433 --> 00:23:42.967
Is he, then, just the same kind
of violent character, or

00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:44.300
randomly violent character?

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.100
Is there a plan besides
expansion?

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.367
At least in Gregory's
portrayal?

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.267
STUDENT: Christianity.

00:23:59.267 --> 00:24:00.200
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.900
STUDENT: Christianity,
forcing conversion.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:05.167
He is Christian.

00:24:05.167 --> 00:24:06.133
Christianity.

00:24:06.133 --> 00:24:10.533
He doesn't force conversion, but
he himself converts, and

00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:13.667
his men with him.

00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:17.433
We know his piety even before
the conversion, because of

00:24:17.433 --> 00:24:22.200
this incident with the silver
liturgical bowl, or ewer.

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:29.733
Right?

00:24:29.733 --> 00:24:35.467
On page seven and
eight, in 227?

00:24:35.467 --> 00:24:37.733
STUDENT: The story
seems dubious.

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:40.900
PROFESSOR: The story
seems dubious.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:48.667
The story being that they
plundered this church, the

00:24:48.667 --> 00:24:57.667
Church of Rheims The bishop asks
Clovis for this silver

00:24:57.667 --> 00:25:00.100
bowl to be returned.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.033
Clovis says he's got to consult
his men, because they

00:25:03.033 --> 00:25:07.267
have a kind of booty
splitting muster.

00:25:07.267 --> 00:25:11.333
Notice that this shows a
certain leader/follower

00:25:11.333 --> 00:25:15.033
relationship, rather than
absolute ruler/follower

00:25:15.033 --> 00:25:17.700
relationship.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:22.333
Clovis says to his men something
on the order of "me

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:26.633
hardies," or "my good men." "Me
hardies" maybe is a little

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:29.200
too pirate-like.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.800
"So," he begins.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.900
"So I want that ewer to return
it to the Church in addition

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:42.400
to my share of half." And one
soldier says, "No, you get

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.400
half of that, just like
everything else.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.033
Takes out his axe, one of the
important weapons of the

00:25:47.033 --> 00:25:51.267
Franks, and splits the
silver thing in half.

00:25:51.267 --> 00:25:56.200
And Clovis doesn't do anything
immediately.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.067
In a later muster, he says to
the guy, recognizing him, your

00:26:01.067 --> 00:26:04.433
kit is a mess. "Your shield, you
call that a shield?" And

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:07.633
he knocks something down, and as
the guy picks it up, Clovis

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:10.533
takes up his own axe and
splits the guy's head.

00:26:10.533 --> 00:26:14.367
Saying as he does so, "Thus
you did to my ewer, or my

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:17.100
basin, in Soissons."

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.633
Yeah, dubious story, but
interesting because it shows

00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:26.767
both the power of the ruler and
some limitations, as well

00:26:26.767 --> 00:26:29.900
as his type of piety.

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:31.167
Power--

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:38.333
actually, you know, the
president of the United States

00:26:38.333 --> 00:26:40.100
actually does have the
power to kill people.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:42.533
We've seen it in action.

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:46.333
Though at a distance and under
certain, very special

00:26:46.333 --> 00:26:47.167
circumstances.

00:26:47.167 --> 00:26:51.267
But basically, it takes a
certain kind of ruler to be

00:26:51.267 --> 00:26:53.633
able to kill someone
outright like that.

00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:57.133
It still happens, but we're
talking about people like

00:26:57.133 --> 00:26:59.433
Qaddafi or despots.

00:27:02.633 --> 00:27:07.533
So certainly, as with killing
the guy who stole the hay from

00:27:07.533 --> 00:27:14.233
Saint Martin's land, Clovis is
following a certain set of

00:27:14.233 --> 00:27:18.700
leadership tips that basically
amounts to winning by maximum

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.967
intimidation, I think
it's fair to say.

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:26.467
But he's got to do this in a
careful way, because his

00:27:26.467 --> 00:27:29.567
followers are very important.

00:27:29.567 --> 00:27:31.267
They are powerful.

00:27:31.267 --> 00:27:34.600
He does depend on them, and he's
got to give at least the

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.933
impression of being the leader
of a band and not the kind of

00:27:39.933 --> 00:27:43.667
ruler of the state that we might
be more familiar with.

00:27:46.433 --> 00:27:53.233
Leadership is personal but
there's a kind of tribal

00:27:53.233 --> 00:27:56.767
sense, or tribal sense
of democracy.

00:27:56.767 --> 00:27:59.600
The other thing about the story,
of course, is once

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:06.167
again the controversy is over
piety towards things of the

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:09.067
Church, even before Clovis has,
at least according to

00:28:09.067 --> 00:28:12.033
Gregory, officially converted.

00:28:12.033 --> 00:28:15.467
It's not that you should be
nice to the Church because

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:18.433
it's good to be a nice person.

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:21.833
It's that you've got to be nice
to the Church because the

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:25.200
Church is in command of
supernatural weapons that will

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.467
overcome the weapons
of this world.

00:28:29.467 --> 00:28:35.300
The supernatural interpenetrates
the physical

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.433
or historical at every point
in Gregory's narrative.

00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:43.267
So the overwhelming fact for
Gregory, as I said before, is

00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:49.067
that he is orthodox, or Catholic
i.e., not Arian.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.100
Clovis is, in Gregory's eyes,
the new Constantine.

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:02.333
Someone who has miraculously
been turned, thuggish though

00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:06.267
he is-- and Constantine
was, as well--

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:10.433
to advance God's work.

00:29:10.433 --> 00:29:13.567
Of course, Gregory regards him
as a barbarian, and he shows

00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:15.333
him as a barbarian.

00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:19.533
He portrays him honestly, or
at least unflatteringly.

00:29:19.533 --> 00:29:23.433
As was said, he murdered
his family.

00:29:23.433 --> 00:29:28.167
And then moreover, if you
remember on pages 19 and 20,

00:29:28.167 --> 00:29:31.667
he pretends to be really sorry
that he can't find anybody

00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:33.667
that he's related to.

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:39.233
He's searching findmyfamily.com
for a

00:29:39.233 --> 00:29:43.567
genealogy or high school
classmates.

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:47.200
Anybody who could
be his friend.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:30:02.733
But in fact, he is
just searching

00:30:02.733 --> 00:30:04.033
them out to kill them.

00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:07.700
And he's got all sorts of tricks
to kill his relatives.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:12.700
Nevertheless, in the same
chapter that describes his

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:22.933
trick on Cloderic, Gregory tells
us, "Having aquired the

00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:25.433
kingdom of Sigibert and its
treasury, he also received

00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:27.733
those people under
his dominion.

00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:30.633
For daily the Lord laid his
enemies low under his hand and

00:30:30.633 --> 00:30:33.300
increased his kingdom, because
he walked before Him with an

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:39.767
upright heart and did what was
pleasing in His sight." Right?

00:30:39.767 --> 00:30:43.833
This is just after Clovis, after
the death of Sigibert,

00:30:43.833 --> 00:30:49.333
calls all the people together,
says, "I don't know what

00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:53.100
happened, but the sons of
Sigibert seem to have died as

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:56.767
they were showing my
envoy's treasure.

00:30:56.767 --> 00:31:01.500
Here's my proposal, make me
king." And they say, "Oh, OK.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.533
Great, yeah.

00:31:03.533 --> 00:31:06.633
Step on the shield and we'll
lift you up, just like the

00:31:06.633 --> 00:31:09.833
Roman emperors."

00:31:09.833 --> 00:31:12.867
Is Gregory a comedian?

00:31:12.867 --> 00:31:15.433
Or is he saying--

00:31:15.433 --> 00:31:17.733
and I think this is more
likely, although he is

00:31:17.733 --> 00:31:18.733
hilarious to read.

00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:20.833
I mean, I hope he's
amused you.

00:31:20.833 --> 00:31:23.367
I hope while you were cursing
me for giving you this

00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:26.167
assignment, or at least praying
to some saints to

00:31:26.167 --> 00:31:33.700
strike me dumb or erupt in boils
or probably not anything

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:38.433
very strong, like you'll notice
that occasionally

00:31:38.433 --> 00:31:42.867
people lose their intestines
when they go to the bathroom.

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:44.500
Probably not.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:50.133
The heretic Arias, for example,
and others who betray

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:51.500
the saints.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.933
Anyway, whatever curses you
were summoning up to me, I

00:31:55.933 --> 00:32:00.333
hope you actually
found this fun.

00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:05.133
This course is fun, as I think
I told you way back in the

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:06.400
beginning of September.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:16.700
So apart from the fun angle,
people are instruments of the

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.133
Lord, and they walk in the sight
of the Lord even if they

00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:22.233
are not themselves
good people.

00:32:24.933 --> 00:32:28.333
The Lord makes use of
instruments, of

00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:31.300
people who are forceful.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.767
It's important to be forceful.

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:37.000
If Clovis was a nice guy-- and
we'll see, and have already

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.067
seen some examples of rulers
who were nice, often

00:32:40.067 --> 00:32:42.267
intellectual, and ineffectual.

00:32:42.267 --> 00:32:47.500
Gregory prefers effectual with
some violent touches to

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.800
ineffectual, because being a
ruler is a hard job in a

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.900
barbarian world, in
a fallen world.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:56.133
Gregory, in this sense,
is like Augustine.

00:32:56.133 --> 00:32:57.300
The world has fallen.

00:32:57.300 --> 00:32:59.433
The world is corrupt.

00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:03.233
There are no good
people in power.

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:06.967
And if they are in power, it is
either unusual or they're

00:33:06.967 --> 00:33:09.200
not going to be in
power for long.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.433
Therefore, it is important
to be violent.

00:33:11.433 --> 00:33:14.300
It is important to be able to
intimidate your troops.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.833
It is important to seek out
those who would oppose you.

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:22.867
And if they've got
to be killed,

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:24.133
they've got to be killed.

00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:31.367
The reason for this is that the
work of the Lord has to be

00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:34.133
advanced, according to Gregory,
and the Church has to

00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:36.733
be protected.

00:33:36.733 --> 00:33:44.200
For Gregory is exemplifying what
I said would happen as

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.100
predicted by Saint Augustine.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.000
The Empire might cease, but
the Church would not.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.500
The Church would deal with
whatever successors came up,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.367
be they Arian, or
preferably not.

00:33:59.367 --> 00:34:03.700
Be they cultivated, or more
likely barbarian.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:08.100
And as barbarian leaders
go, Clovis and his

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.133
sons were not so bad.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.033
We're not really sure how
Clovis converted.

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:23.700
Because Gregory is invested in
a story that likens Clovis to

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.400
Constantine, we have the
same kind of thing.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.367
Before a battle, he makes a deal
with God that if he wins

00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:36.867
the battle, he will convert.

00:34:36.867 --> 00:34:40.033
We don't really know if he was
converted before this battle

00:34:40.033 --> 00:34:44.533
in 494, as Gregory reports, or
maybe in a battle against the

00:34:44.533 --> 00:34:46.500
Visigoths in 506.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:51.233
But it doesn't really matter.

00:34:51.233 --> 00:34:55.567
It's very important that
the Arians be defeated.

00:34:55.567 --> 00:35:01.700
He's got a story that's not in
Murray, in Book 2, Chapter 23,

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.067
in which an Arian bishop
named Cryola.

00:35:05.067 --> 00:35:09.600
C-R-Y-O-L-A. Cryola,
not crayola.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:11.367
Cryola.

00:35:11.367 --> 00:35:15.800
Cryola is angry because he
sees the Catholic bishops

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.800
performing miracles all
over the place.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:24.100
So he pays a guy to pretend to
be blind, and then to greet

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.900
him as he comes to Church, and
beg him to heal his sight, and

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.933
then to say, "Oh my gosh,
I've been healed.

00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:34.067
I can see.

00:35:34.067 --> 00:35:40.933
But God punishes this by making
him actually blind, at

00:35:40.933 --> 00:35:41.600
this point.

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:43.567
And then the guy, very helpfully
from the Catholic

00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:46.200
point of view, said oh,
I wasn't blind.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.067
This evil bishop, Cryola, bribed
me in order to pretend

00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:53.300
to be blind, but now God and
his saints, Saint Martin in

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.700
particular, have punished me."
And so that it takes a

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.333
Catholic bishop to heal
him back to sight.

00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:04.733
So this is Gregory's attitudes
towards the Arians.

00:36:04.733 --> 00:36:09.567
On the other hand, he does
report that the Franks

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.467
besieged Saragossa.

00:36:11.467 --> 00:36:14.867
This is on pages 41, 42.

00:36:14.867 --> 00:36:16.333
The Spanish city of Saragossa.

00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.567
They've gotten that
far in their

00:36:18.567 --> 00:36:21.200
attacks on the Visigoths.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:26.167
But the Arians were able
to fight them off.

00:36:26.167 --> 00:36:29.800
"They circled the walls carrying
the tunic of Saint

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:36.100
Vincent and singing psalms.
With the women dressed in

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.400
black, their hair
hanging loose,

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.433
covered in ashes, lamented.

00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:47.867
Seeing the situation,
Theodebert returned.

00:36:47.867 --> 00:36:52.200
He gave up the siege." The
Arians may be heretics, but

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.433
they've got the tunic
of Saint Vincent.

00:36:55.433 --> 00:36:59.933
And the power of that relic is
so great that even in the

00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:05.833
hands of miscreants, it's
not to be opposed.

00:37:05.833 --> 00:37:11.067
Saint Vincent, a very important
saint and the patron

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:13.100
of Saragossa.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.800
So the Arians are fakes, but
they are not completely

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.467
without spiritual
power, either.

00:37:18.467 --> 00:37:24.467
And this is a kind of universe
in which there are natural and

00:37:24.467 --> 00:37:26.667
supernatural forces.

00:37:26.667 --> 00:37:31.500
And it's not that one trumps the
other, exactly, but that

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.533
they both have to be
taken into account.

00:37:38.167 --> 00:37:44.367
So, Clovis consolidates a large
kingdom in most of what

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:47.000
would become France.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.967
Roman Gaul, medieval France.

00:37:48.967 --> 00:37:52.900
France named after this
group, the Franks.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:59.700
The Visigoths now were pushed
out into Spain and just that

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.467
part of France bordering
on Spain.

00:38:04.633 --> 00:38:07.400
Clovis received the favor
of the Church

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.667
because he was Catholic.

00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:18.200
His conversion, let's say around
500, is ninety years

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.500
before the Visigoths
become Catholic.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:25.500
And this aids him greatly,
because the Church is in

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:32.800
possession of learned people,
financial resources, and

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.367
spiritual power.

00:38:35.367 --> 00:38:37.367
So we follow the Franks--

00:38:37.367 --> 00:38:39.833
and we will follow them up
through Charlemagne and his

00:38:39.833 --> 00:38:41.000
successors--

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.400
because they are successful,
and because their own

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:53.267
self-consciousness is as the
rightful rulers of the former

00:38:53.267 --> 00:38:54.267
Western Empire.

00:38:54.267 --> 00:38:58.100
A claim that in various
generations is more or less of

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:04.367
a reality and that is by no
means inevitable, but is

00:39:04.367 --> 00:39:06.967
something that they will
eventually make good on.

00:39:06.967 --> 00:39:10.067
For the time being, Clovis
considers himself a

00:39:10.067 --> 00:39:14.533
representative of the Byzantine
Empire, but a

00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:16.933
representative who very
conveniently doesn't have to

00:39:16.933 --> 00:39:18.167
do anything.

00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:22.400
The Byzantine Emperor sends
him the title of consul.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:29.900
He's very pleased at this, but
it doesn't bind him, really.

00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:35.800
So much for Clovis.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.367
Establishment of Frankish
hegemony.

00:39:38.367 --> 00:39:42.067
The prominence of the Franks
in the post-Roman West. The

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:49.167
first Catholic people among
the barbarian invaders.

00:39:49.167 --> 00:39:53.667
Now we turn briefly
to his sons.

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:57.067
He divided his kingdom equally,
and you have a map in

00:39:57.067 --> 00:40:00.800
the back that shows the division
of the realm under

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.667
Clovis' sons.

00:40:02.667 --> 00:40:09.367
Chlothar, Childebert, Chlodomer,
and Theuderic.

00:40:09.367 --> 00:40:12.033
This practice of division
is dangerous.

00:40:12.033 --> 00:40:19.867
It is usually a better idea to
give it to one son, because

00:40:19.867 --> 00:40:22.200
then you don't divide
the kingdom.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.300
On the other hand, if you have
four sons who are all

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.867
militarily competent,
they're going to

00:40:29.867 --> 00:40:30.900
fight with each other.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.300
And in fact they fight with
each other, as Gregory

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.933
describes in Book
3, even though

00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:36.400
they've been given divisions.

00:40:39.067 --> 00:40:45.100
The violence of Clovis' sons is
crude and even ludicrous.

00:40:48.700 --> 00:40:54.967
So for example, this awful
incident of Chlodomer's sons

00:40:54.967 --> 00:41:02.967
being protected by Clovis' queen
Chlothild And her sons,

00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:08.033
the boys' uncles, Chlothar and
Theodoric, invite the boys to

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:08.800
come for a visit.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:13.933
And Clotilde, who seems rather
credulous, says, "Great idea!"

00:41:13.933 --> 00:41:18.400
Once they are in the power of
these two brothers, who of

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.967
course like Clovis want to
kill their relatives,

00:41:20.967 --> 00:41:27.267
particularly their younger
relatives, they send a sword

00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:29.367
and a pair of scissors, right?

00:41:29.367 --> 00:41:32.667
"Which will it be," the
messenger asks the queen.

00:41:32.667 --> 00:41:37.467
"Cut off their hair or kill
them?" Cutting off their hair

00:41:37.467 --> 00:41:40.567
will symbolize that they're no
longer eligible for rulership.

00:41:40.567 --> 00:41:43.300
And it may lead to them being
put away in a monastery or

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:45.567
something like that, but
they're taking early

00:41:45.567 --> 00:41:47.600
retirement.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.133
They're twelve, fourteen years
old, but they've had it.

00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:54.833
And Chlothild is so angry, at
least according to Gregory,

00:41:54.833 --> 00:41:57.433
that he says she'd rather
see them die.

00:41:57.433 --> 00:41:58.600
And then they kill them.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:03.367
They kill them in this ludicrous
way, because one of

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:06.833
them gets cold feet, and the
other is furious and takes up

00:42:06.833 --> 00:42:08.533
the sword, and just
kills them.

00:42:08.533 --> 00:42:09.800
Even though they're begging.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:14.267
I mean, it's a rather
gruesome scene.

00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:17.767
Meanwhile, in a scene that we
haven't got in Murray's

00:42:17.767 --> 00:42:22.300
edition, Theuderic attempts
to kill Chlothar.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:30.167
He invites him, and he's got men
waiting to ambush him, but

00:42:30.167 --> 00:42:32.600
the cloth isn't low
enough down.

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.300
They're sort of behind a
partition, a cloth partition,

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:37.700
but Chlothar can
see their feet.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.033
And so he kind of turns
back and starts to

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:43.933
walk out of the hall.

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:46.867
And then Theuderic says, "No,
no, no, I just invited you to

00:42:46.867 --> 00:42:49.467
give you a gift." And he gives
him a silver goblet or

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:51.200
something like that.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:54.967
So, Chlothar escapes from this,
but Theuderic is so

00:42:54.967 --> 00:42:58.267
angry at having been tricked
that he then sends a messenger

00:42:58.267 --> 00:43:01.333
saying it was a mistake to
give back the goblet.

00:43:01.333 --> 00:43:06.767
So, I mean, these guys,
what can I say?

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:15.900
Yet beneath the barbarian acts
is a society that is still

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:18.633
being governed fairly closely.

00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:20.367
There is a fairly sophisticated

00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:22.033
administration still.

00:43:22.033 --> 00:43:24.467
There's a gold coinage,
which takes a lot of

00:43:24.467 --> 00:43:27.167
resources to maintain.

00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:30.367
These rulers are collecting
taxes, and they are collecting

00:43:30.367 --> 00:43:32.933
taxes according to
written records.

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:37.833
There's public land.

00:43:37.833 --> 00:43:42.267
There's revenue from land
belonging to the king.

00:43:42.267 --> 00:43:46.367
The kings are reasonably
conscientious about the

00:43:46.367 --> 00:43:47.633
appointment of bishops.

00:43:50.733 --> 00:43:56.067
What is Gregory's attitude
towards these sons of Clovis?

00:43:56.067 --> 00:43:59.967
He certainly portrays
them as fratricidal.

00:44:02.533 --> 00:44:06.467
Nevertheless, on page 26, he
tells us that the brothers

00:44:06.467 --> 00:44:10.667
were endowed with great courage
and had considerable

00:44:10.667 --> 00:44:12.467
military resources.

00:44:12.467 --> 00:44:19.567
Once again, their power
is directed more for

00:44:19.567 --> 00:44:21.200
good than for bad.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.767
And a lot of their power
for bad is merely

00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:25.067
directed at each other.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.567
He considers them, in other
words, appropriate rulers for

00:44:31.567 --> 00:44:32.833
savage times.

00:44:39.967 --> 00:44:44.600
At one point, two of
the brothers make

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.833
war against a third.

00:44:45.833 --> 00:44:49.400
Specifically, Childebert and
Theuderic against Chlothar.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:53.233
Chlothar is the guy who has just
been depicted by Gregory

00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:56.400
as the tough one, the one who
killed the two nephews.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.700
He's also an adulterer.

00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.533
And yet, faced with
his brother's

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:09.567
armies, he prays to God.

00:45:09.567 --> 00:45:11.700
And his mother, Queen
Chlothild,

00:45:11.700 --> 00:45:15.300
prays to Saint Martin.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:20.633
So powerful are these prayers
that the two brothers are

00:45:20.633 --> 00:45:21.133
unsuccessful.

00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:28.467
A hailstorm pelts their troops,
spares Chlothar, and

00:45:28.467 --> 00:45:29.767
Chlothar is victorious.

00:45:29.767 --> 00:45:32.333
The brothers do not succeed
in dislodging him.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.500
Here then, we have the power
of the Merovingians and the

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.067
limitations on that power.

00:45:43.067 --> 00:45:46.733
The limitations are partly
military, partly that of

00:45:46.733 --> 00:45:51.100
fratricidal intrigue, of
people getting killed.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:54.733
But they're also partly
supernatural.

00:45:54.733 --> 00:45:59.767
And as you read further into
the grandsons of Clovis,

00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:03.167
people whom Gregory himself
has dealings with,

00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:08.633
particularly the wayward
Chilperic, you'll see rulers

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:13.533
that Gregory considers to be
evil and rulers who are really

00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:16.833
falling away from the example.

00:46:16.833 --> 00:46:20.733
But what interests us in our
readings for next week is the

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:22.733
nature of this society.

00:46:22.733 --> 00:46:25.667
What's holding it together if
it's rulers are so violent?

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:32.733
Why is it not just falling
apart into fragments and

00:46:32.733 --> 00:46:33.567
shattering?

00:46:33.567 --> 00:46:42.933
How could this dynasty rule over
a polity for something on

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:47.167
the order of 250 years?

00:46:47.167 --> 00:46:50.167
Have fun with the papers, have
fun with Gregory, and we'll

00:46:50.167 --> 00:46:52.067
talk next week.

00:46:52.067 --> 00:46:53.333
Thanks.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.501
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, I'm going to continue

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.010
talking about renal physiology
today;

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.560
again, this is covered in
Chapter 9.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.119
You will have noticed as you're
reading Chapter 9 that there's

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.920
more covered than just renal
physiology there.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.068
It also talks about
biotransformations and the role

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:31.840
of the liver in getting rid of
substances.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.797
We're not going to cover that
part in class but I encourage

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:39.892
you to read it as a whole to get
a broader perspective of how

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:43.986
kidney function fits into the
overall ability of your body to

00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:47.125
maintain what we call
homeostasis or a constant

00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:50.373
environment.
As I talked about last

00:00:50.373 --> 00:00:54.069
time, one of the important
elements of this constant

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:56.750
environment is to maintain
sodium,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.829
potassium, bicarbonate,
and the levels of other key

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.990
molecules at a constant level
throughout the day and

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.937
throughout your life.
It does that--and you're able

00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:13.079
to do that not by regulating how
much you eat of those things,

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.439
but they kidney does that for
you by sensing what

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.155
concentrations are in your body,
keeping what you need and

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.659
getting rid of what you don't
need.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.098
We started talking about how
the kidney is able to accomplish

00:01:24.098 --> 00:01:27.691
this remarkable task.
Hopefully, the main point I

00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.476
wanted to make in the last
lecture was how grateful you

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:35.260
ought to be that your kidneys do
function properly,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.584
because as one of the results
of that is that you only have to

00:01:39.584 --> 00:01:43.838
produce about 1 L or 1.5 L of
urine per day to get rid of all

00:01:43.838 --> 00:01:47.880
the waste products that are
produced by metabolism in your

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.568
body.
Without that concentrating

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:54.091
ability of your kidney,
I mean the ability of the

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:58.348
kidney to produce a urine that's
very concentrated in waste

00:01:58.348 --> 00:02:02.314
rather than dilute in waste,
you only have to relief

00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:06.210
yourselves of 1.5 L of fluid
everyday instead of the 100 or

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.308
so liters that you'd have to in
the absence of that ability to

00:02:10.308 --> 00:02:13.336
concentrate.
That makes possible a lot of

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:17.648
the things that we enjoy in life
like sitting through a 50 minute

00:02:17.648 --> 00:02:20.160
lecture.
What I want to talk about

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.823
today is some of how the kidney
does that and I'm going to go

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:26.509
back a few steps because I
covered a lot.

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.658
I wanted to give you an
overview at the end of sort of

00:02:28.658 --> 00:02:30.319
the last half of the lecture
last time,

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.126
about how the nephron functions
and I'm going to go back now and

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:37.691
step through it a little bit
more slowly and talk about some

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.690
of the details.
Now, the--like the other

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.315
systems we've talked about the
brain, the heart,

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:48.491
the circulatory system,
the kidney has a very sort of

00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:52.760
rich and complex physiology
which now we understand fairly

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.972
well.
We're only going to scratch the

00:02:54.972 --> 00:02:57.520
surface of that and if you get
excited about it,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.024
there are ways for you to learn
more in your time here at Yale

00:03:03.024 --> 00:03:07.225
and certainly beyond.
This is a picture that I

00:03:07.225 --> 00:03:10.870
showed you before,
sort of to orient you again;

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.680
I have this picture of a kidney
lying on its side.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.400
It's a layered structure,
the outer layer or the sort of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.919
shell around the outside of the
kidney,

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.725
this fibrous capsule which sort
of distinguishes what's inside

00:03:27.725 --> 00:03:30.470
the kidney from what's outside
the kidney,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.579
the layer below that is called
the cortex, the inner layers

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.909
that have these sort of
striations is called the

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.975
medulla.
All of this comes together in

00:03:41.975 --> 00:03:46.410
this region here called the
renal pelvis,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.400
this region where the renal
artery enters,

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.456
the renal vein leaves,
and the ureter exits the kidney

00:03:56.456 --> 00:03:59.403
as well.
Everything collects sort of

00:03:59.403 --> 00:04:03.979
at--what's at the bottom of this
diagram but it would be on the

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.556
inside or medial surface of the
kidney and it's in its anatomic

00:04:08.556 --> 00:04:12.316
position.
I mentioned last time that

00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:17.678
the functional units of the
kidney are this structure called

00:04:17.678 --> 00:04:20.674
a nephron.
Each kidney has about a million

00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:23.894
of these nephrons and that
they're oriented within these

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:26.340
layers,
so a nephron is going to sit

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.529
sort of this axis here,
going up and down in this

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:31.880
diagram.
That's the reason why I turned

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.283
this kidney on its side so when
you look at the nephron here you

00:04:35.283 --> 00:04:38.740
can think about it sitting in
this orientation in the kidney.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.121
Of course, the kidney has this
sort of curved structure so the

00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:45.281
nephrons are going to sort of
radiate out from the central

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.329
portion through the medulla and
up into the cortex,

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:53.255
with the glomerulus near the
cortex, and the Loop of Henle

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:56.279
stretching down into the
medulla.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:05:00.689
I also mentioned several
features of the nephron.

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.461
One is the glomerulus where the
place where filtration takes

00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:12.819
place, this tuft of capillaries
that's surrounded by a capsule.

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:17.528
The capsule is there to catch
this filtrate that's produced by

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:21.619
high pressure inside the
arteriole system forcing some

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.170
fluid out through these leaky
capillaries.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.058
The capsule,
called Bowman's capsule,

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:32.793
is there to catch this fluid
and start it on its way through

00:05:32.793 --> 00:05:36.336
this series of tubules.
I talked about different

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.550
regions of the tubules,
the proximal convoluted tubule,

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.100
proximal because it's near the
glomerulus, the Loop of Henle,

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.709
this structure that stretches
down through the cortex into the

00:05:46.709 --> 00:05:50.786
medulla and then back up again,
and the distal convoluted

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:55.843
tubule which is farther from the
glomerulus and empties into the

00:05:55.843 --> 00:06:00.660
collecting duct which then moves
down through the cortex,

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.649
through the medulla,
and into this region of the

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:07.276
renal pelvis where all the
collecting ducts empty into the

00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:09.629
ureter and then onto the
bladder.

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:14.518
A filtrate of plasma is
produced here in the glomerulus

00:06:14.518 --> 00:06:19.248
and as this filtrate of plasma,
this fluid that is going to be

00:06:19.248 --> 00:06:22.365
urine at some point,
moves through this series of

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.577
tubules,
it gets processed,

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:27.490
it gets modified,
it gets changed.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.488
In particular,
the cells of these tubules are

00:06:31.488 --> 00:06:35.759
able to reabsorb the molecules
that you need.

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.836
They reabsorb a lot of water,
they reabsorb a lot of sodium,

00:06:38.836 --> 00:06:41.737
potassium, bicarbonate,
and they do that without

00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:45.597
reabsorbing a lot of the waste
products you don't need like

00:06:45.597 --> 00:06:48.667
urea;
as you might guess given this

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:54.180
configuration that there's some
interplay between the activities

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.379
that happen at different parts
of the tubule.

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:02.877
That is, if sodium is being
reabsorbed in the proximal

00:07:02.877 --> 00:07:07.459
tubule, which it is,
then where does that sodium go?

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:13.766
It's pumped out of the tubule
and into the space around--into

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:19.441
the space of the kidney
surrounding it and so sodium is

00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:24.521
going to accumulate out here.
Now, where does that sodium

00:07:24.521 --> 00:07:25.940
go?
Well, eventually it's going to

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.281
back into the blood so there
must be a lot of blood vessels

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:30.110
around there as well.
They're not shown in this

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.295
diagram;
they'll be shown in the next

00:07:32.295 --> 00:07:35.306
one.
This sodium leaves the urine

00:07:35.306 --> 00:07:40.945
through the walls of the tubules
and is reabsorbed back into

00:07:40.945 --> 00:07:44.370
blood vessels.
That leaves some sodium out

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.038
here in this space,
and one of the really

00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:49.639
interesting things about the
kidney,

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:52.027
which we won't be--about the
nephron, in particular,

00:07:52.027 --> 00:07:54.649
that we won't be able to talk
about in so much detail,

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:58.762
is how one part of its tubule
system uses the result of the

00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:02.449
other in order to establish
gradients to produce this

00:08:02.449 --> 00:08:05.730
concentrated urine.
We're not really going to talk

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.029
about that but I wanted to
mention it on this diagram here,

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:13.436
that there are real important
reasons why the tubules are

00:08:13.436 --> 00:08:17.450
arranged in the anatomical
pattern that they are.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:23.096
An additional thing,
which I mentioned last time,

00:08:23.096 --> 00:08:25.529
is that if you looked,
as cell biologists did,

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:29.563
at the cells that make up these
linings of these tubules,

00:08:29.563 --> 00:08:33.597
you'd find that they look
different in different parts of

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:36.320
the nephron.
This has to do with their

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.968
different functions.
Some are very good at

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.498
reabsorbing sodium,
some are very good at

00:08:41.498 --> 00:08:44.281
reabsorbing water,
and some are good at other

00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.110
functions.
The function of each--of these

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.871
groups of cells that make up
different portions of the tubule

00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:53.629
is critical for overall nephron
function.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:58.148
I'll say a little bit about
that just to give you a flavor

00:08:58.148 --> 00:09:02.428
for how that happens without
talking too much about the

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:05.707
details.
This shows a collection of

00:09:05.707 --> 00:09:09.509
nephrons, sort of in a more
complex arrangement.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:12.812
I've got the kidney here so you
can be reminded again that this

00:09:12.812 --> 00:09:16.061
might be a structure that comes
from here and then you can see

00:09:16.061 --> 00:09:18.288
several nephrons.
In particular,

00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:22.958
there's a lot of glomeruli in
this picture where the nephron

00:09:22.958 --> 00:09:27.471
that's associated with this
glomerulus and this glomerulus

00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:32.299
aren't shown so that we can
focus on just a few of them.

00:09:32.299 --> 00:09:35.537
Just to give you a sense for
these million nephrons that are

00:09:35.537 --> 00:09:38.880
arranged in the kidney,
they have their glomeruli at

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.132
different locations,
up and down,

00:09:41.132 --> 00:09:45.215
they are surrounded by their
proximal and distal convoluted

00:09:45.215 --> 00:09:47.902
tubules,
and these Loops of Henle

00:09:47.902 --> 00:09:52.480
stretch down into the medullary
region and then come back up.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.376
I wanted to use this more
complicated diagram to sort of

00:09:56.376 --> 00:09:59.937
illustrate the flow.
How does fluid move through

00:09:59.937 --> 00:10:04.621
this--through one particular
nephron within this system here,

00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:09.985
and so I hope this comes out.
Did you see the red arrow up

00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:12.168
here?
That red arrow represents

00:10:12.168 --> 00:10:16.122
arteriole flow of blood and this
is a branch of the renal artery

00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:19.762
which is serving this whole
collection of nephrons that are

00:10:19.762 --> 00:10:22.523
here.
Of course that vessel branches,

00:10:22.523 --> 00:10:25.481
at some point,
and here I show a branch of a

00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:27.842
branch,
which is heading up towards

00:10:27.842 --> 00:10:31.250
these glomeruli up in this upper
region of the cortex.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:37.067
Blood is flowing through these
branches of the renal artery

00:10:37.067 --> 00:10:42.483
into the substance of the kidney
and it flows up into a

00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:47.286
glomerulus here.
Now, because this is not

00:10:47.286 --> 00:10:52.980
too distant a branch from the
aorta pressure is still high

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.203
here.
You know that pressure remains

00:10:55.203 --> 00:10:57.860
pretty high until you get down
to the arteriole levels;

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.299
we learned that when we talked
about the circulatory system.

00:11:02.299 --> 00:11:06.832
The pressure here is fairly
high, it might be 70 or 80

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:10.582
millimeters of mercury.
This is the pressure that

00:11:10.582 --> 00:11:12.970
drives filtration in the
glomerulus.

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.482
The green arrow,
which just appeared up here,

00:11:16.482 --> 00:11:20.793
is supposed to indicate for
this glomerulus right there

00:11:20.793 --> 00:11:24.949
filtration happens.
Because of the pressure drop in

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:28.166
the glomerulus,
the low pressure in Bowman's

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:31.511
space,
this space that surrounds it,

00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:36.395
fluid is driven through the
walls of the capillary and

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:40.706
collected outside.
What is produced there is

00:11:40.706 --> 00:11:46.600
really, what I called last time,
an ultra-filtrate of plasma.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.921
That is the urine or the
filtrate that's going to become

00:11:49.921 --> 00:11:53.908
urine, at this point,
would be identical to plasma in

00:11:53.908 --> 00:11:58.350
composition except all of the
big items are removed;

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.229
all the large molecules,
all the cells are removed,

00:12:01.229 --> 00:12:04.763
other than that it's identical.
The concentration of sodium in

00:12:04.763 --> 00:12:08.085
the filtrate is the same as the
concentration of sodium in the

00:12:08.085 --> 00:12:10.455
plasma,
concentration of urea same as

00:12:10.455 --> 00:12:13.981
concentration of the plasma,
concentration of bicarbonate

00:12:13.981 --> 00:12:16.381
and so on.
As long as any molecule that's

00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:19.648
below that cut off it's going to
have the same concentration as

00:12:19.648 --> 00:12:22.202
it is in plasma,
so there this green arrow

00:12:22.202 --> 00:12:25.198
represents filtration.
From there the fluid moves

00:12:25.198 --> 00:12:28.336
through the distal convoluted
tubules, which you can't really

00:12:28.336 --> 00:12:30.480
see here, but it's up in this
portion.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.773
The white, if you can see on
the--here some of these are

00:12:33.773 --> 00:12:37.505
white and some of them are blue.
The white ones are the proximal

00:12:37.505 --> 00:12:40.732
convoluted tubule but they're
really not like in the diagram

00:12:40.732 --> 00:12:43.550
before,
these convoluted tubule are

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:48.259
sort of mixed together,
they interact with one another.

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:51.342
This filtrate goes through the
proximal convoluted tubule down

00:12:51.342 --> 00:12:54.324
in the Loop of Henle and now you
can see--follow these green

00:12:54.324 --> 00:12:56.163
arrows,
it's moving down,

00:12:56.163 --> 00:13:00.468
it takes a turn deep in the
medulla and starts coming back

00:13:00.468 --> 00:13:05.149
up again and heads back up to
the distal convoluted tubule.

00:13:05.149 --> 00:13:07.448
Now, we're not going to
talk about it at all in this

00:13:07.448 --> 00:13:09.370
class, but if you go on to study
physiology,

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:14.612
one of the most amazing things
about the nephron is its--is

00:13:14.612 --> 00:13:19.673
that this loop allows the
nephron to create a gradient of

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:24.644
osmolarity within the tissue
outside the nephrons in the

00:13:24.644 --> 00:13:27.516
kidney.
It's able to create a

00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:32.523
concentration gradient of sodium
basically, but of ions that it

00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:36.987
can then use to reabsorb water.
Austin, who was sitting in the

00:13:36.987 --> 00:13:39.393
front last time,
mentioned that she thought

00:13:39.393 --> 00:13:43.230
osmosis was an important part of
how the kidney works and it is.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.934
Osmotic forces are how water
concentration--how water moves

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:51.937
around in the kidney.
The kidney is able to regulate

00:13:51.937 --> 00:13:56.212
how concentrated or how dilute
your urine is by using osmotic

00:13:56.212 --> 00:14:00.416
gradients and those osmotic
gradients are established in the

00:14:00.416 --> 00:14:04.188
Loop of Henle.
It's really a remarkable sort

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:09.025
of biophysical process that
you'll learn about if you study

00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:13.408
more renal physiology.
There's a reason why the fluid

00:14:13.408 --> 00:14:17.852
goes down and goes up and it's
to establish these gradients

00:14:17.852 --> 00:14:21.837
which the kidney uses to
concentrate or extract water

00:14:21.837 --> 00:14:24.682
from the urine.
This orange area here

00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:27.727
represents the flow going from
the distal convoluted tubule

00:14:27.727 --> 00:14:30.877
back into the collecting duct
and down through the collecting

00:14:30.877 --> 00:14:33.029
duct and eventually into the
ureter.

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:38.386
This is just a more complicated
diagram of what I've told you

00:14:38.386 --> 00:14:43.654
already and it's--I encourage
you to sort of walk through it

00:14:43.654 --> 00:14:49.368
and look at all the parts so you
have a sense for how the anatomy

00:14:49.368 --> 00:14:53.175
of the kidney works.
This picture I showed you

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:56.503
before, just to remind you of
the first step in producing

00:14:56.503 --> 00:14:59.631
urine, is filtration.
I've talked about it several

00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:03.459
times now but there's this tuft
of capillaries which sits inside

00:15:03.459 --> 00:15:05.889
this capsule called Bowman's
capsule.

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:11.300
There's an artery which feeds
blood in, called the afferent

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:15.087
arteriole.
'Afferent' means towards so

00:15:15.087 --> 00:15:20.126
it's the arteriole that's
carrying blood towards the

00:15:20.126 --> 00:15:21.510
glomerulus,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:33.296
and the efferent arteriole
which carries the blood out of

00:15:33.296 --> 00:15:37.111
the glomerulus.
Now, the flow rates here would

00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:39.569
be different;
the blood that's flowing

00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:43.542
through the--the amount of blood
flowing through the afferent

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:47.980
arteriole and the amount flowing
through the efferent arteriole,

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.830
'efferent' meaning away from,
are different because some

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.483
fluid is lost.
That's the amount that's

00:15:55.483 --> 00:16:01.148
filtered into Bowman's space.
We talked about last time

00:16:01.148 --> 00:16:05.799
that these are both arterioles
and that because they're

00:16:05.799 --> 00:16:10.796
arterioles they can constrict or
reduce their diameters and

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:13.716
expand,
dilate or expand their

00:16:13.716 --> 00:16:16.003
diameters.
Because of this,

00:16:16.003 --> 00:16:20.621
if it constricts then the
pressure drop over that length

00:16:20.621 --> 00:16:25.887
of arteriole is going to change.
Having these two adjustable

00:16:25.887 --> 00:16:31.231
resistances on both sides of the
glomerulus allows each nephron

00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:35.972
to regulate what the pressure is
in the fluid inside the

00:16:35.972 --> 00:16:40.974
capillaries of the glomerulus.
Now, since its pressure inside

00:16:40.974 --> 00:16:45.009
these capillaries which is the
driving force for filtration,

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:51.105
that means that each nephron
has the ability to adjust how

00:16:51.105 --> 00:16:55.169
much is filtered in each
glomerulus.

00:16:55.169 --> 00:16:59.561
Now, if--we're going to--in
a slide or two going to talk

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.730
about a concept called the
glomerular filtration rate.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.426
This is a concept that's
defined for your whole kidneys

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:09.960
and the glomerular filtration
rate,

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.944
we all have a glomerular
filtration rate,

00:17:12.944 --> 00:17:17.346
it's the rate at which filtrate
is being produced in all the

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:21.101
glomeruli of our kidneys.
It's the rate at which the

00:17:21.101 --> 00:17:24.039
fluid that's going to become
urine is produced.

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:27.339
It's an important measure of
how well your kidney is

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:30.638
functioning, is how much
filtrate it's producing per

00:17:30.638 --> 00:17:33.363
minute.
What I want to emphasize on

00:17:33.363 --> 00:17:37.540
this diagram here that another
remarkable thing about the

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.163
function of the kidney is that
each of these individual million

00:17:42.163 --> 00:17:46.489
or two million nephrons are able
to adjust their individual

00:17:46.489 --> 00:17:51.710
filtration rate by changing the
pressure within the glomerulus.

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:54.228
Of course this was a picture I
showed you last time of the

00:17:54.228 --> 00:17:57.484
actual filtration membrane,
the surface of these

00:17:57.484 --> 00:18:03.211
capillaries where this pressure
drop acts and through which

00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:09.474
large things are filtered out.
Here's a cartoon of the

00:18:09.474 --> 00:18:16.039
glomerulus and this cartoon
actually shows several things.

00:18:16.039 --> 00:18:19.409
One it shows the arteriole,
the afferent arteriole that's

00:18:19.409 --> 00:18:22.778
coming in and the afferent
arteriole that's going out and

00:18:22.778 --> 00:18:25.727
so here's the tuft of
capillaries that make up the

00:18:25.727 --> 00:18:28.051
glomerulus.
Here's Bowman's space,

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.299
which is ready to catch the
filtrate.

00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:36.253
This first arrow here
represents the filtrate that's

00:18:36.253 --> 00:18:42.789
produced in the glomerulus of
this particular nephron.

00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:45.719
Now, after that filtrate's
produced it starts to flow

00:18:45.719 --> 00:18:49.267
through the proximal convoluted
tubule and then through the Loop

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:51.125
of Henle,
and the distal convoluted

00:18:51.125 --> 00:18:53.015
tubule, and eventually the
collecting duct,

00:18:53.015 --> 00:18:57.990
and as we know from last time,
several things can happen.

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.379
One is that molecules within
this fluid can be reabsorbed,

00:19:02.379 --> 00:19:06.999
and if they're reabsorbed they
move out of the tubular system

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:10.758
and into--back into blood.
That's why there are blood

00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:13.710
vessels surrounding all the
nephrons in the kidneys,

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.279
so that there's a blood flow
that's ready to catch these

00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:20.589
molecules as they're reabsorbed
from the tubules.

00:19:20.589 --> 00:19:24.123
We also mentioned that
there are some special processes

00:19:24.123 --> 00:19:27.839
of secretion so that the blood
vessels in the kidney are smart

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:31.555
enough to detect some molecules
and secrete them actively into

00:19:31.555 --> 00:19:34.450
the urine.
Then, whatever is not

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.480
reabsorbed, plus what's
secreted, is what ends up in the

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:43.869
urine after it flows through all
the tubules.

00:19:43.869 --> 00:19:47.318
What's different here is then
instead of showing the complex

00:19:47.318 --> 00:19:50.534
geometry of the tubules,
this just shows a tube which is

00:19:50.534 --> 00:19:54.377
going to the bladder down here.
This diagram is simplified

00:19:54.377 --> 00:19:58.319
because I wanted to just talk
about one concept and that's

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:03.073
this glomerular filtration rate,
the rate at which fluid is

00:20:03.073 --> 00:20:07.470
produced in the glomeruli of all
of the kidneys.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.836
The question is how would
you measure this glomerular

00:20:10.836 --> 00:20:13.819
filtration rate in people?
If it's an important measure of

00:20:13.819 --> 00:20:15.579
kidney function how would you
measure it?

00:20:15.579 --> 00:20:20.250
It turns out that physiologists
have learned how to measure it

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:24.077
by taking advantage of a
particular molecule called

00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:26.649
inulin.
Inulin is a molecule that's not

00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:29.440
a normal part of our diet,
it's a polysaccharide,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.852
but it's a polysaccharide that
is of sort of intermediate

00:20:32.852 --> 00:20:35.610
molecular weight.
I think it's about 1,000 or

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.931
2,000 in molecular weight,
but your body doesn't know how

00:20:38.931 --> 00:20:41.746
to digest it.
If you get inulin in your

00:20:41.746 --> 00:20:45.480
blood, it just circulates and
isn't changed at all,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:50.109
but it's small enough that it's
filtered in the glomerulus.

00:20:50.109 --> 00:20:55.661
If there's inulin in the blood
then it gets filtered through

00:20:55.661 --> 00:21:00.460
the glomerulus and ends up in
the ultra-filtrate.

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.103
Another remarkable property
about inulin is that it's not

00:21:05.103 --> 00:21:07.482
reabsorbed.
There's no reason for your body

00:21:07.482 --> 00:21:10.270
to reabsorb it because it's not
something you can really use and

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.503
you don't need it,
and it's not actively secreted,

00:21:13.503 --> 00:21:17.069
so whatever gets filtered ends
up in the urine.

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:21.377
This molecule turns out to be a
convenient tool that physicians

00:21:21.377 --> 00:21:25.128
can use to measure your
glomerular filtrate rate in the

00:21:25.128 --> 00:21:28.880
event that they want to test
your kidney function.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.958
How would you do that?
You would inject an amount of

00:21:32.958 --> 00:21:38.916
inulin into the blood and you
would measure how much--what's

00:21:38.916 --> 00:21:43.460
the concentration of inulin in
the plasma?

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:47.238
You would inject some amount of
inulin and you'd measure how

00:21:47.238 --> 00:21:50.847
much of it is in the plasma.
You'd then wait over some

00:21:50.847 --> 00:21:54.559
period of time and you would
collect the urine and you'd

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:58.339
measure how much of that inulin
appears in the urine.

00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:02.665
Now, since inulin is
neither reabsorbed nor secreted,

00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:06.605
however many molecules of
inulin are filtered at the

00:22:06.605 --> 00:22:11.240
glomerulus has to be the same as
the number of molecules that

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:14.487
enter the urine.
It's not reabsorbed,

00:22:14.487 --> 00:22:18.279
it's not secreted,
so whatever number of molecules

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:21.220
enter here they have to leave
here.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:25.188
So, if I know the concentration
of inulin in the urine I know

00:22:25.188 --> 00:22:28.759
how much urine is produced over
some period of time,

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:31.240
I know the concentration in the
plasma.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.595
Remember that one of the
features of this ultra-filtrate

00:22:34.595 --> 00:22:38.012
is that it just cuts off in
molecular weight but whatever

00:22:38.012 --> 00:22:41.490
concentration--if you're below
that molecular weight,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.634
whatever concentration is in
the plasma is the same as the

00:22:45.634 --> 00:22:48.980
initial concentration in the
ultra-filtrate,

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:54.049
and so the plasma inulin
concentration is the same here.

00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:57.508
If I just do a simple
accounting for all the inulin,

00:22:57.508 --> 00:23:00.967
whatever the glomerular
filtration rate is times the

00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:04.494
concentration in the plasma has
to equal whatever the

00:23:04.494 --> 00:23:08.021
concentration in the urine is
times the rate of urine

00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:11.230
production.
I can measure in a person

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.270
how much urine they're producing
per time, you can measure the

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.920
concentration of inulin in the
urine,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.083
you can measure the
concentration in the blood and

00:23:21.083 --> 00:23:24.569
so you can calculate the
glomerular filtration rate.

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:28.104
This is a method that takes
advantage of the unique

00:23:28.104 --> 00:23:30.720
properties of this molecule
inulin.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:34.822
This is a--physician's use this
general strategy in a variety of

00:23:34.822 --> 00:23:38.794
ways to measure flow rates of
things inside your body that are

00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:42.635
difficult to measure directly
and they do that by looking at

00:23:42.635 --> 00:23:45.798
what's called a tracer molecule.
In this case,

00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:48.753
insulin is a tracer.
It's picked for its particular

00:23:48.753 --> 00:23:52.318
properties, that it's filtered
freely in the glomerulus but

00:23:52.318 --> 00:23:57.266
neither reabsorbed nor secreted.
It allows you to calculate some

00:23:57.266 --> 00:24:01.957
physiological function sort of
deep inside your body,

00:24:01.957 --> 00:24:07.190
so you can measure glomerular
filtration rate this way.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.544
I've already showed you
this picture that shows the

00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:18.097
vascular system of the kidney,
sort of laid out in a line

00:24:18.097 --> 00:24:20.576
here.
Here's the renal artery

00:24:20.576 --> 00:24:23.956
branching into afferent
arterioles, branching into

00:24:23.956 --> 00:24:27.514
glomerular capillaries,
back into efferent arterioles

00:24:27.514 --> 00:24:30.859
and then to the capillaries that
surround the tubules,

00:24:30.859 --> 00:24:34.009
and the pressure drops that are
associated with that.

00:24:34.009 --> 00:24:38.378
I show it just to remind you of
how the kidney could regulate

00:24:38.378 --> 00:24:42.600
its glomerular filtration rate
by changing the diameters of

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.950
either the efferent or afferent
arteriole.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:49.596
Changing the resistances,
changing the relative pressure

00:24:49.596 --> 00:24:52.049
drops along the kidney
vasculature,

00:24:52.049 --> 00:24:55.996
and therefore regulating the
important level which is here

00:24:55.996 --> 00:25:00.220
how much pressure is in the
glomerulus to drive filtration.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.081
I've talked about this
several times now,

00:25:03.081 --> 00:25:06.528
and I think if you study the
diagram and read the text

00:25:06.528 --> 00:25:09.259
hopefully that will make sense
to you.

00:25:09.259 --> 00:25:15.571
It is--this pressure is what
drives inside the glomerulus the

00:25:15.571 --> 00:25:20.936
flow of filtrate and the
production of filtrate that

00:25:20.936 --> 00:25:25.210
becomes urine.
What happens after this point?

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.136
What happens are these two
processes that we've talked

00:25:28.136 --> 00:25:31.450
about that make the kidney
different from a simple filter.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.750
Filtration is an important part
of its function,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.296
that's easy to understand from
sort of an engineering

00:25:36.296 --> 00:25:38.007
perspective.
You produce this

00:25:38.007 --> 00:25:40.617
ultra-filtrate,
and then the kidney works very

00:25:40.617 --> 00:25:44.096
hard to recover the molecules
that you need so that you don't

00:25:44.096 --> 00:25:47.634
have to produce a large volume
of urine in order to get rid of

00:25:47.634 --> 00:25:50.246
the waste.
It does that by two processes,

00:25:50.246 --> 00:25:53.390
reabsorption and secretion,
which I've already mentioned,

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:57.391
and we're really going to focus
mainly on reabsorption for the

00:25:57.391 --> 00:26:01.690
rest of the time here today.
In reabsorption the key

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:07.669
elements of reabsorption are
reabsorption of water or return

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:13.039
of much of this volume of water
that's filtered at the

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:18.511
glomerulus and recovery of
solutes that are needed like

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:22.970
sodium and potassium and
bicarbonate.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.883
This table just sort of
tells you in general what

00:26:26.883 --> 00:26:30.420
happens at different portions of
the nephron.

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:33.590
Filtration happens in Bowman's
capsule, I think I've said

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:37.001
enough about that one.
Selective reabsorption happens

00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:40.419
in all other elements of the
tubules, the proximal,

00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:43.359
the Loop of Henle,
and the distal convoluted

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:46.024
tubule.
How does selective reabsorption

00:26:46.024 --> 00:26:48.106
happen?
It happens by the physical

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.812
processes of diffusion or just
the movement of molecules down

00:26:51.812 --> 00:26:56.031
concentration gradients,
and it also happens by active

00:26:56.031 --> 00:26:58.448
transport.
We talked about active

00:26:58.448 --> 00:27:01.434
transport earlier.
We talked--for example when we

00:27:01.434 --> 00:27:04.903
were talking about the action
potential, we talked about this

00:27:04.903 --> 00:27:08.141
active transport system that's
able to shuttle sodium and

00:27:08.141 --> 00:27:10.569
potassium molecules across
membranes.

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:15.678
So, most cells in the body
have this active transport

00:27:15.678 --> 00:27:19.236
system called the sodium
potassium pump,

00:27:19.236 --> 00:27:25.271
or the sodium potassium ATPase.
Its main function is to bring

00:27:25.271 --> 00:27:29.190
sodium from inside the cell,
pump it out,

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:34.579
take potassium from outside the
cell and pump it in.

00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:39.282
As a result of the action of
this pump that's what creates

00:27:39.282 --> 00:27:43.902
this normal state that you have
high extracellular sodium

00:27:43.902 --> 00:27:47.697
concentrations and high
intracellular potassium

00:27:47.697 --> 00:27:51.937
concentrations.
If that pump wasn't working,

00:27:51.937 --> 00:27:56.861
then sodium would diffuse from
outside to in because the

00:27:56.861 --> 00:28:01.069
concentration is higher outside
than inside,

00:28:01.069 --> 00:28:04.844
and potassium would diffuse
from inside to out because the

00:28:04.844 --> 00:28:07.890
concentration is higher inside
than outside.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:11.589
Now, this pump is driven by
ATP.

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:14.791
ATP is a molecule,
it's one of the end--it's a

00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:19.344
molecule that's produced when we
metabolize sugars and get energy

00:28:19.344 --> 00:28:23.047
from them.
We store them in the form of

00:28:23.047 --> 00:28:28.946
ATP, and then the body uses ATP
to do things like operate this

00:28:28.946 --> 00:28:31.874
pump.
A lot of the ATP that you're

00:28:31.874 --> 00:28:36.259
using right now in your body is
being used to maintain the

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:40.875
concentration of sodium high
outside your cells and potassium

00:28:40.875 --> 00:28:44.644
high inside your cells.
Why are you spending so much

00:28:44.644 --> 00:28:47.641
energy doing that?
Why would your body spend so

00:28:47.641 --> 00:28:51.307
much energy trying to maintain
these differences of ion

00:28:51.307 --> 00:28:52.530
concentrations?

00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:04.823
Student:
[inaudible]Professor Mark

00:29:04.823 --> 00:29:06.551
Saltzman: Because these
concentrations have to exist for

00:29:06.551 --> 00:29:09.533
cellular functions like--?
Like the generation of action

00:29:09.533 --> 00:29:13.522
potentials in the nervous
system, like the generation of

00:29:13.522 --> 00:29:17.584
action potentials in the heart
that drive contraction and

00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:21.743
beating of the heart.
Without these differences of

00:29:21.743 --> 00:29:25.885
concentration you could neither
send nerve impulses,

00:29:25.885 --> 00:29:30.217
your heart would not beat;
maintains life and lots of the

00:29:30.217 --> 00:29:34.172
activities of life and so a lot
of energy goes into producing

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:36.240
them.
In those same kinds of

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.914
processes are used in the kidney
to shuttle ions from one place

00:29:39.914 --> 00:29:43.470
to another, I'll show you an
example of that in a minute.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:46.947
Reabsorption of water,
I tried to emphasize last time

00:29:46.947 --> 00:29:49.690
how important reabsorption of
water is,

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.802
because you have to produce a
lot of filtrate in order to

00:29:53.802 --> 00:29:57.903
collect a lot of waste products.
You got to produce a lot of

00:29:57.903 --> 00:30:01.170
filtrate in order to get a lot
of urea into the urine.

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:04.993
You don't want to lose that
much water because any water you

00:30:04.993 --> 00:30:07.650
lose you have to drink to
recover from.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:12.483
Reabsorption of water is a very
important process that happens

00:30:12.483 --> 00:30:15.890
in the kidney,
it happens in all the tubular

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.767
segments.
Secretion happens mainly in the

00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:21.389
distal convoluted tubule,
and as I mentioned,

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:24.190
we're not going to say very
much about that.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.562
If we were just able to
look and take one nephron and

00:30:27.562 --> 00:30:30.994
take that complicated series of
tubes that I showed you in

00:30:30.994 --> 00:30:34.066
diagrams before and stretch it
out while it still is

00:30:34.066 --> 00:30:37.053
functioning,
and then measure as a function

00:30:37.053 --> 00:30:39.656
of distance along this
complicated tubule,

00:30:39.656 --> 00:30:43.273
what's the concentration or
relative concentration of some

00:30:43.273 --> 00:30:46.319
of these key molecules we're
talking about?

00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:49.230
What we would see is shown in
this diagram here.

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.393
Now, I mention this special
property in inulin,

00:30:52.393 --> 00:30:55.349
that it's neither reabsorbed or
secreted,

00:30:55.349 --> 00:31:00.897
and that's shown here by this
flat line, so whatever gets

00:31:00.897 --> 00:31:05.272
filtered in the glomerulus,
at the glomerulus,

00:31:05.272 --> 00:31:09.864
that number of molecules
remains in the urine throughout

00:31:09.864 --> 00:31:12.869
its progress through the
tubules.

00:31:12.869 --> 00:31:15.672
That's why you can use it as a
tracer to measure GFR (glomerula

00:31:15.672 --> 00:31:18.248
filtration rate) because it's
neither reabsorbed in any of

00:31:18.248 --> 00:31:22.126
these tubules nor secreted,
so the number of molecules that

00:31:22.126 --> 00:31:26.601
come out in the filtrate,
that's the number that leave in

00:31:26.601 --> 00:31:29.250
the urine.
That's not true for glucose.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:33.679
I mentioned yesterday that
glucose is not normally found in

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:36.480
urine.
When you do find glucose in the

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.296
urine of an individual that
indicates that there's some

00:31:40.296 --> 00:31:44.395
disease process going on and
that's because glucose is very

00:31:44.395 --> 00:31:48.000
efficiently reabsorbed in the
proximal tubule.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.799
If I just looked at
concentration within the

00:31:50.799 --> 00:31:54.509
filtrate, within the urine
through the proximal tubule,

00:31:54.509 --> 00:31:57.627
there'd be a lot of glucose
here and that concentration

00:31:57.627 --> 00:32:00.688
drops as we move through the
proximal tubule such that

00:32:00.688 --> 00:32:03.863
there's no glucose in the
filtrate by the time we get to

00:32:03.863 --> 00:32:07.494
the end of the proximal tubule.
That's one of the simpler

00:32:07.494 --> 00:32:10.662
cases, that glucose is just
reabsorbed in the proximal

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.434
tubule.
Sodium, on the other hand,

00:32:13.434 --> 00:32:16.529
has a much more complicated
pattern.

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:19.823
That sodium concentration drops
as you move through the proximal

00:32:19.823 --> 00:32:22.279
tubule so a lot of that sodium
is reabsorbed,

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:25.356
about two-thirds of it is
reabsorbed in the proximal

00:32:25.356 --> 00:32:28.390
tubule.
Then, if I looked over the Loop

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:33.049
of Henle in the descending loop,
the loop that goes down,

00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:37.661
actually sodium molecules come
back in, and then sodium

00:32:37.661 --> 00:32:41.589
molecules go back out in the
ascending loop.

00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:45.246
This has to do with the
establishment of gradients of

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:49.230
sodium that I mentioned before
in the interstitial space which

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:52.756
allows the kidney to--this
represents those--the sodium

00:32:52.756 --> 00:32:55.630
that's used to create those
gradients,

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:59.759
those gradients are used for
water absorption.

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:03.198
Then, most of the rest of the
kidney is--the rest of the

00:33:03.198 --> 00:33:06.511
sodium is cleaned up or
recovered in the distal tubule

00:33:06.511 --> 00:33:10.221
and the collecting tubules.
Urea, which has this pattern

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:13.702
here, a lot reabsorbed but then
it comes back out again,

00:33:13.702 --> 00:33:15.980
and then it's reabsorbed
finally.

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.658
Now, some of these things are
going to be hard for you to

00:33:18.658 --> 00:33:20.380
understand why they go in and
out.

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.677
It has to do with this complex
interplay that I mentioned

00:33:23.677 --> 00:33:27.269
before between processes that
are happening in different parts

00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:30.321
of the tubule,
establishing gradients that are

00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:33.920
then used in different portions
to aid in reabsorption.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.919
How do these things happen?
How is sodium,

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:43.430
for example,
reabsorbed so efficiently in

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.702
the proximal tubule?
Well, I'm going to give you a

00:33:46.702 --> 00:33:49.336
simple example of that just so
that you have a way of thinking

00:33:49.336 --> 00:33:51.649
about the mechanism,
but you're going to remember

00:33:51.649 --> 00:33:54.240
that there's more going on than
just what I described.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.731
Imagine that this is the
proximal tubule,

00:33:57.731 --> 00:34:02.009
so a part of the tubule just
after Bowman's space,

00:34:02.009 --> 00:34:07.160
where sodium concentration is
high inside the filtrate.

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.029
What's the concentration of
sodium in the filtrate right

00:34:10.029 --> 00:34:14.403
after the glomerulus?
It's the same as the

00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:20.604
concentration in plasma.
What's the concentration of

00:34:20.604 --> 00:34:24.079
sodium inside cells that line
the tubule?

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:30.711
Well, like all cells these have
sodium potassium pumps and so

00:34:30.711 --> 00:34:36.900
the concentration of sodium
inside these cells is low.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.989
The intracellular concentration
of sodium is low.

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.911
High concentration here,
low concentration here,

00:34:43.911 --> 00:34:48.249
so if this membrane is
permeable to sodium it's going

00:34:48.249 --> 00:34:51.420
to diffuse from inside to
outside.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.699
What would allow--does
sodium diffuse through

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:58.182
membranes?
Charged molecules don't diffuse

00:34:58.182 --> 00:35:00.688
through membranes on their own,
not if it's just a lipid

00:35:00.688 --> 00:35:04.179
bilayer.
What allows sodium to diffuse?

00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:07.530
What kinds of structures allow
sodium to diffuse through a

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:08.530
lipid membrane?

00:35:12.079 --> 00:35:14.018
Protein channels,
ion channels,

00:35:14.018 --> 00:35:17.702
sodium channels--so there must
be sodium channels in these

00:35:17.702 --> 00:35:21.449
membranes and there are,
and the sodium moves through.

00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:25.139
Now, you have high sodium
inside or higher than before

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:28.550
because sodium can leak through
these channels,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.917
but you have on this other
surface of the cell,

00:35:32.917 --> 00:35:37.570
you have a lot of these sodium
potassium pumps.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:42.348
These sodium potassium pumps
are constantly pumping sodium

00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:46.580
out and bringing potassium,
sodium out, potassium in and

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.025
there's pumps here,
there's pumps here,

00:35:49.025 --> 00:35:52.755
there's pumps here.
So, any molecules of sodium

00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:57.386
that enter this side get
efficiently pumped out through

00:35:57.386 --> 00:36:00.801
the other side.
The net effect of these two

00:36:00.801 --> 00:36:04.961
processes, diffusion on this
boundary and active transport on

00:36:04.961 --> 00:36:08.799
this boundary,
is that sodium molecules move

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:12.650
from inside the tube to outside
the tube.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.878
Now, if sodium
concentration is high here where

00:36:14.878 --> 00:36:17.682
is it going to go?
Well, there are blood vessels

00:36:17.682 --> 00:36:21.374
up here and they're going to
reabsorb this sodium just by

00:36:21.374 --> 00:36:23.880
simple diffusion processes as
well,

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.898
so blood that's flowing through
this region is going to take all

00:36:27.898 --> 00:36:32.303
the extra sodium away.
The net effect here is that

00:36:32.303 --> 00:36:38.796
sodium gets moved from--in this
filtrate, this urine back into

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:42.323
the blood.
Now, the property of these

00:36:42.323 --> 00:36:46.692
cells, which allows this to
happen, is that the sodium

00:36:46.692 --> 00:36:50.320
potassium pumps are only on this
surface,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:56.476
they're not on this surface.
The sodium potassium pumps are

00:36:56.476 --> 00:36:58.539
only on this surface and not on
this surface.

00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:02.159
On this surface just diffusion
of sodium down its gradient is

00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:06.530
the only thing that happens,
and on this surface that sodium

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:10.000
is moved out into the
interstitial space.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.955
This is one example of the
kind of properties that cells of

00:37:13.955 --> 00:37:17.528
the tubules use in order to
selectively move a particular

00:37:17.528 --> 00:37:20.079
molecule from one side to the
other.

00:37:20.079 --> 00:37:21.659
What are the properties that we
talked about?

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:24.892
Membranes are leaky,
membranes are leaky because

00:37:24.892 --> 00:37:28.400
they have channels,
here's a leaky membrane here,

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.292
and membranes have active
transport systems that move

00:37:33.292 --> 00:37:37.619
selectively ions from one side
to the other.

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:40.984
This is an example that shows
how that works with sodium,

00:37:40.984 --> 00:37:44.468
there are systems that work
with all of the ions that we've

00:37:44.468 --> 00:37:47.626
talked about,
not in exactly the same way but

00:37:47.626 --> 00:37:49.900
with the same sorts of concepts.

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:55.219
I don't want to say too
much about this diagram.

00:37:55.219 --> 00:38:01.314
I just show it here so that you
can look at it at your leisure

00:38:01.314 --> 00:38:06.610
if that's what you would do with
your leisure time.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:11.561
You could study this diagram
which just shows you something

00:38:11.561 --> 00:38:16.682
about what kinds of transporters
are functioning in different

00:38:16.682 --> 00:38:21.331
cells of the proximal tubule,
the ascending or descending

00:38:21.331 --> 00:38:24.860
limb of Henle's Loop,
the distal convoluted tubule,

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:28.588
the collecting duct.
These are channels that allow

00:38:28.588 --> 00:38:33.489
for selective movement of
certain kinds of molecules like

00:38:33.489 --> 00:38:38.389
sodium, like glucose,
like bicarbonate and potassium.

00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:41.077
This table is a little bit more
complicated than the one I

00:38:41.077 --> 00:38:45.672
showed you before,
but just to try to put it all

00:38:45.672 --> 00:38:51.843
into perspective again,
that the kidney because of

00:38:51.843 --> 00:38:58.139
glomerular filtration produces
per 24 hours 26,

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:01.682
000 milliequivalents of sodium
are filtered and almost all of

00:39:01.682 --> 00:39:05.289
those are reabsorbed,
only a few of them are excreted.

00:39:05.289 --> 00:39:08.222
Now, if you happen to eat a
lot more salt on one day,

00:39:08.222 --> 00:39:10.948
what would happen?
You would filter more,

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:15.450
you would reabsorb a little
less, and you would excrete that

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.058
balance.
You would filter more because

00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:21.718
you would have eaten more salt
then you needed so more sodium

00:39:21.718 --> 00:39:24.280
would appear in your blood than
normal.

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.148
The concentration would be
slightly higher in the plasma,

00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:30.584
you'd filter more of it,
you'd reabsorb less of it,

00:39:30.584 --> 00:39:34.469
and the result would be you
would excrete more.

00:39:34.469 --> 00:39:37.773
The same thing with potassium
and with these other molecules

00:39:37.773 --> 00:39:40.342
here, and interestingly,
what this shows is the

00:39:40.342 --> 00:39:42.920
percentage of these molecules
that are reabsorbed.

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.102
Then, in this table here shows
you what part of the tubular

00:39:47.102 --> 00:39:51.501
system that reabsorption takes
place, so you could think about

00:39:51.501 --> 00:39:55.386
that if you wanted.
I want to just say one last

00:39:55.386 --> 00:39:59.551
word about water balance and
this is just to illustrate the

00:39:59.551 --> 00:40:03.788
concept of homeostasis that
we've been talking about for all

00:40:03.788 --> 00:40:07.207
these ions before,
that you could think of your

00:40:07.207 --> 00:40:10.489
body as a vessel where there are
inputs and output.

00:40:10.489 --> 00:40:14.703
For water the input is mainly
the water that you drink or that

00:40:14.703 --> 00:40:18.226
you've taken in food because
some foods contain high

00:40:18.226 --> 00:40:21.912
quantities of water too.
For a normal individual you're

00:40:21.912 --> 00:40:25.184
going to take about 2.1 L of
water in per day in food and

00:40:25.184 --> 00:40:27.480
drink.
You synthesize some water

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:31.373
because some of the chemical
reactions that occur during

00:40:31.373 --> 00:40:35.197
metabolism have water as a
byproduct, so you synthesize

00:40:35.197 --> 00:40:39.521
some water.
Your overall daily intake is

00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:44.833
about 2.3 L of water per day.
You have to get rid of that

00:40:44.833 --> 00:40:48.619
water, because if you're taking
in water and you're not getting

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:51.489
rid of it then you're expanding
your volume.

00:40:51.489 --> 00:40:55.320
You get rid of it in a variety
of ways, about a liter and a

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.895
half in urine,
almost a third of a liter

00:40:57.895 --> 00:41:01.989
through your lungs because you
breathe in air that's relatively

00:41:01.989 --> 00:41:04.844
dry,
you breathe out air that's very

00:41:04.844 --> 00:41:06.934
humid.
If you take a glass plate and

00:41:06.934 --> 00:41:08.913
you breathe out on it,
it gets foggy,

00:41:08.913 --> 00:41:11.991
you could see water condense
because your breathe is much

00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:15.289
more--has much more water in it
than the air around us,

00:41:15.289 --> 00:41:17.530
so we lose actually quite a lot
of water that way.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:20.588
Through sweat and other
activities you lose more water,

00:41:20.588 --> 00:41:23.590
so that your daily loss
balances your daily intake.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.079
Now, what if you drink more
water?

00:41:25.079 --> 00:41:28.354
What if you drink--what if
you're--I know there's a lot of

00:41:28.354 --> 00:41:31.416
water bottles in the room here.
A lot of you carry water around

00:41:31.416 --> 00:41:33.598
with you and you drink water
constantly throughout the day,

00:41:33.598 --> 00:41:34.200
what happens?

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:43.319
You drink more water than this,
if you ingest 3.1 L per water

00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:48.168
then you've got to lose
3.1--you've got to lose 3.3 L of

00:41:48.168 --> 00:41:50.591
water.
Normally what you lose in your

00:41:50.591 --> 00:41:53.367
lungs and by sweat and other
mechanisms doesn't change,

00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:56.039
what changes is the amount that
you use in urine.

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:59.016
You're all familiar with this,
if you drink more water one day

00:41:59.016 --> 00:42:03.360
than you did the day before,
you're going to produce more

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:07.269
urine, go to the bathroom more
often.

00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:09.230
I don't know another way to say
it--well, I do know.

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:10.579
I don't want to say it any
other way.

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:18.903
What if you--what if instead of
water you decided on another day

00:42:18.903 --> 00:42:23.102
not to eat any salt?
You're not going to eat any

00:42:23.102 --> 00:42:24.970
salt during the day what would
happen?

00:42:29.409 --> 00:42:33.886
Well, you would need to
maintain your salt concentration

00:42:33.886 --> 00:42:38.199
high, need to maintain the salt
concentration high.

00:42:38.199 --> 00:42:41.075
Your kidney has to lose a
little bit of salt,

00:42:41.075 --> 00:42:44.539
it can't recover 100% so if you
ate no salt at all,

00:42:44.539 --> 00:42:47.759
you can't recover 100% of it
you're going to lose a little

00:42:47.759 --> 00:42:49.849
bit of the salt through your
urine.

00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:53.592
It can't recover 100% of the
salt, so you're going to lose a

00:42:53.592 --> 00:42:56.130
little bit of salt through your
urine.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:01.614
If you didn't eat any salt then
your sodium concentration is

00:43:01.614 --> 00:43:05.239
going to drop,
it would want to drop.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:09.112
Your body won't allow that to
happen, the kidneys won't allow

00:43:09.112 --> 00:43:12.177
that to happen.
If it notices that you're

00:43:12.177 --> 00:43:16.978
sodium concentration is going
down but you're not bringing any

00:43:16.978 --> 00:43:20.204
more sodium in,
how else can it change the

00:43:20.204 --> 00:43:23.964
concentration?
It could decrease the volume of

00:43:23.964 --> 00:43:28.056
water in your body so it could
produce more watery urine,

00:43:28.056 --> 00:43:31.843
or urine with more water in it.
Try this experiment,

00:43:31.843 --> 00:43:34.503
don't eat any salt,
it means you probably can't go

00:43:34.503 --> 00:43:37.815
to the dining hall but if you
don't eat any salt for a day you

00:43:37.815 --> 00:43:40.530
will notice that you're
producing more urine.

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.038
If you weight yourself in the
morning and you weigh yourself

00:43:43.038 --> 00:43:45.760
at night, your weight will go
down over the course of one day.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.692
That's why it's easy to lose a
pound or two,

00:43:47.692 --> 00:43:50.210
you can do that by just
restricting salt in your diet.

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:53.830
It's a nice example of how your
body--how the kidney in

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.249
particular senses what
concentrations are present in

00:43:57.249 --> 00:44:01.070
your body and adjusts what it
can depending on what you're

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:04.489
eating in order to maintain
what's important.

00:44:04.489 --> 00:44:08.326
What's important is the
concentration of extracellular

00:44:08.326 --> 00:44:12.451
sodium has to be at the right
level so that your brain and

00:44:12.451 --> 00:44:15.130
your heart can function
properly.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.654
Okay, that's it for renal
physiology, in the section this

00:44:19.654 --> 00:44:22.519
afternoon we'll talk about
dialysis.

00:44:22.519 --> 00:44:25.882
Dialysis is the technology
developed by biomedical

00:44:25.882 --> 00:44:29.794
engineers over the last century
that allows people to live

00:44:29.794 --> 00:44:33.705
without normal kidney function
by performing some of these

00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:37.000
essential functions outside the
body.

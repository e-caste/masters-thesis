00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:04.680
Professor John Rogers:
So the first thing I want

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.343
you to do is turn to page 378.
This is the beginning of Book

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.139
Nine.
It's a curious feature,

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.346
I think, of Book Nine that it
begins with a consideration of

00:00:18.346 --> 00:00:21.158
talk.
The narrator is lamenting the

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:23.929
fact that Raphael has just
departed the garden and that

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.044
soon,
not long after Raphael's

00:00:26.044 --> 00:00:30.235
departure, Adam and Eve will
fall, and this fall is going to

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:34.425
have an impact -- and this is
something that the narrator is

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:38.190
really emphasizing here -- on
the way they talk.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.354
For example,
it's going to be impossible

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:43.239
after this point for human
beings to enjoy a friendly

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.487
conversation with an angel.
So this is how Book Nine

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:49.789
begins:
No more of talk where God

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.821
or Angel Guest
With Man, as with his Friend,

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.293
familiar us'd
To sit indulgent,

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:58.831
and with him partake
Rural repast,

00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:04.510
permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblam'd.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.810
With the departure now of
Raphael, man will never again be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.582
permitted to enjoy "venial
discourse unblam'd," and

00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:15.599
"venial" here has a special
meaning.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.379
It means "allowable" or
"permissible."

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.826
Milton's suggesting that the
Fall brings with it certain

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:24.395
restrictions,
specifically restrictions of

00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.250
language,
and there start to arise

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.010
constraints on speech or what
Milton calls here "talk."

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.950
When you read the last two
books of Paradise Lost,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.629
which we'll be doing for
the next week,

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.593
you'll begin to see just what
kinds of restrictions Adam's

00:01:39.593 --> 00:01:43.425
speech will be subjected to.
The angel Michael will

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.997
continually criticize and
correct Adam's talk,

00:01:46.997 --> 00:01:51.031
and the general feeling,
I think, of the last two books

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:53.995
can be quite uncomfortable for
just this reason:

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:57.118
after the Fall,
Adam and Eve live in a world in

00:01:57.118 --> 00:02:00.840
which mere speech itself can be
blamed or, in some cases,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.109
it can be prohibited altogether.
The Fall is imagined in Books

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.560
Nine and Ten to have,
as you can -- of course,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.768
this is the event heralded in
the title, so it's a big deal --

00:02:14.768 --> 00:02:18.770
it's imagined to have an
enormous range of consequences,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.839
and Milton divides these
consequences in to essentially

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:25.468
two categories.
First, you have the mythic

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:28.579
consequences that take place or
are imagined to take place in

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.353
the physical world;
and then there are also the

00:02:31.353 --> 00:02:34.681
psychic, the psychological,
consequences that take place

00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:38.069
somewhere within the
consciousnesses of Adam and Eve.

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.346
It's with a great amount of
imaginative literary gusto that

00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:47.349
Milton enumerates the mythic
consequences,

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.745
which he does at some length in
Book Ten.So you'll remember

00:02:50.745 --> 00:02:53.987
that after the Fall,
Adam and Eve are punished with

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:56.783
bad weather.
It's wonderful when Milton does

00:02:56.783 --> 00:02:59.561
this kind of thing:
he tries to represent this

00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.708
punishment with as much
scientific specificity as he

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:05.813
possibly can.
So the angels are instructed by

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:09.735
God to shift the sun around and
to tilt the poles of the earth

00:03:09.735 --> 00:03:12.500
some twenty degrees from the
sun's axis,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.977
and these mythically imagined
astronomical alterations will

00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:19.680
bring with them the four
seasons,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.697
new to earth,
and of course,

00:03:21.697 --> 00:03:25.732
the inclement winds -- the
biting cold that will plague

00:03:25.732 --> 00:03:30.439
forever and forever the sons and
daughters of Adam and Eve.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.569
Needless to say,
these are enormous changes.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.035
But when you consider the sheer
magnitude of these cosmic

00:03:36.035 --> 00:03:38.509
shifts, it's all the more
interesting,

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.732
I think, and all the more
noteworthy that the effect of

00:03:42.732 --> 00:03:47.424
the Fall that Milton laments
first in Book Nine is the effect

00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:52.272
on consciousness and the effect
specifically on speech.It's

00:03:52.272 --> 00:03:57.120
here in Book Nine that Milton
signals that his own talk,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.575
his own speech,
has been affected by this new

00:03:59.575 --> 00:04:02.923
subject -- the subject that he
has no choice but to deal with

00:04:02.923 --> 00:04:04.659
now,
which is that of the Fall.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.480
Milton will have to alter,
this is how the argument goes,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.573
the style of this poem in order
to suit the subject matter of

00:04:12.573 --> 00:04:15.793
the Fall,
and so this is what he's doing

00:04:15.793 --> 00:04:19.214
at line five,
or what he tells us he's doing:

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:22.870
"I must now change / these
notes to Tragic."

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.797
The change in Milton's poetic
notes, these musical notes that

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:30.323
are, of course,
his poetic verses or the nature

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:35.072
of his literary representation
-- the change in these notes is

00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:39.277
manifest in a lot of ways
throughout the final books of

00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:42.512
Paradise Lost.
For one thing,

00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:47.250
it's here that we have the last
invocation of the poem.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.082
And it's not coincidental,
I think, that this last

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:53.088
invocation in Paradise Lost
is not actually an

00:04:53.088 --> 00:04:57.700
invocation at all.
Milton does not directly

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.319
address Urania,
the muse.

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.029
He can only speak of her in the
third person.

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:08.458
This is line twenty:
"if answerable style I can

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:12.310
obtain / of my Celestial
Patroness..."

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.142
Milton isn't able,
it seems, to address the muse

00:05:16.142 --> 00:05:20.872
directly anymore.How big
that "if" is -- "if answerable

00:05:20.872 --> 00:05:24.949
style I can obtain" -- we don't
actually know.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.926
We don't know whether he'll be
able to obtain the answerable

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:30.946
style.
There's been a huge fall-off in

00:05:30.946 --> 00:05:33.899
the poet's poetic
self-confidence.

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.017
He can't express himself
"unblam'd" as he had tried to do

00:05:37.017 --> 00:05:39.690
in the invocation to holy light
in Book Three.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.620
You'll remember that question:
"may I express thee unblam'd?"

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.079
He's failed here to clear the
lines of communication between

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:51.989
himself and this heavenly being,
and of course,

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:57.154
in this failure Milton the
narrator, the persona of the

00:05:57.154 --> 00:05:59.129
poet,
resembles Adam and Eve.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.140
He's no longer permitted this
kind of direct-dial access to

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.012
Urania just as Adam and Eve are
no longer permitted their

00:06:07.012 --> 00:06:11.300
friendly conversations with a
friendly angel like Raphael.

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.735
They will have conversations
with an angel,

00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:17.433
or Adam will,
but as you will see,

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:22.750
Michael's stern tutelage can
hardly be described as friendly.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.005
It's certainly instructive but
Milton would never be able to

00:06:26.005 --> 00:06:28.544
bring himself to use the
adjective "affable" in

00:06:28.544 --> 00:06:32.579
characterizing Michael as,
of course, he did so charmingly

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:36.801
with Raphael.So for Milton,
the Fall is inextricably

00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:40.870
connected to problems of
language and specifically the

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.063
problems of literature,
and so this is one of the

00:06:45.063 --> 00:06:49.175
things that we'll be looking at.
This is why -- and I know I'm

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:52.006
always beginning lectures with,
"Can you believe it that we

00:06:52.006 --> 00:06:54.788
don't find out in Paradise
Lost until now that this

00:06:54.788 --> 00:06:56.790
incredibly important thing
happens?"

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.240
I'll be doing it yet one more
time.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.524
It's not until now -- and this
seems as big a postponement as

00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:05.667
any of the postponements that
I've mentioned:

00:07:05.667 --> 00:07:10.095
it's not until now in Book Nine
that Milton finally gets around

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:14.165
to explaining why it is he
decided to write his epic about

00:07:14.165 --> 00:07:16.910
the Fall,
the fall of man.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.263
Look at line twenty-five: 
Since first this Subject

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:24.548
for Heroic Song
Pleas'd me long choosing,

00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:28.290
and beginning late;
Not sedulous by Nature to indite

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.290
Wars, hitherto the onely
Argument

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.149
Heroic deem'd,
chief maistry to dissect

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:37.950
With long and tedious havoc
fabl'd Knights

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.803
In Battels feign'd…
Milton had intended for quite

00:07:41.803 --> 00:07:44.571
some time, as we know,
to write his epic poem on the

00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:48.254
subject of a fabled knight.
He actually wanted to have his

00:07:48.254 --> 00:07:52.157
great English epic be something
like a continuation of the

00:07:52.157 --> 00:07:56.450
legend of King Arthur,
and his epic was going to be a

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.697
chivalric romance epic like the
poems by the great Renaissance

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:04.714
poets Ariosto and Tasso,
or of course,

00:08:04.714 --> 00:08:07.438
like The Faerie Queene
by his own countryman,

00:08:07.438 --> 00:08:10.018
Edmund Spenser.
In fact, one of the central

00:08:10.018 --> 00:08:12.655
figures, or you could say the
central figure,

00:08:12.655 --> 00:08:16.311
in The Faerie Queene is
just that legendary Arthur that

00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:19.967
Milton had as a young man wanted
to write about.But Milton

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:23.623
now insists that it was on moral
grounds that he finally chose

00:08:23.623 --> 00:08:26.920
not to write his poem in the
form of a heroic,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.511
chivalric romance.
This is line thirty-two of Book

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:35.537
Nine: Milton decided not to
devote or invest his poetic

00:08:35.537 --> 00:08:39.489
talent in all of those
meaningless features of romance

00:08:39.489 --> 00:08:44.187
literature that he's now saying
improperly go under the title of

00:08:44.187 --> 00:08:46.336
"heroic,"
so he refuses,

00:08:46.336 --> 00:08:49.000
this is line thirty-two,
to describe:

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.528
Races and Games,
Or tilting Furniture,

00:08:52.528 --> 00:08:54.902
emblazon'd Shields,
Impreses quaint,

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:58.676
Caparisons and Steeds;
Bases and tinsel Trappings,

00:08:58.676 --> 00:09:01.153
gorgious Knights
At Joust and

00:09:01.153 --> 00:09:06.153
Tornament…
And this list is something like

00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:11.700
-- these are the common elements
of the romance tradition.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.610
It's kind of like a Cliff Notes
summary of all of the

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.856
conventional features of a
romance like Sir Philip Sidney's

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:20.990
Arcadia or Edmund
Spenser's Faerie Queene.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.180
In some cases,
Milton is actually lifting

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.419
entire phrases,
such as "tinsel Trappings,"

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:29.149
which appears a few times in
The Faerie Queene,

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:32.456
out of the pages of
Spenser.But Milton knows

00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:37.100
perfectly well that this is a
disservice to his favorite poet,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.316
Spenser, and the romances of
The Faerie Queene --

00:09:40.316 --> 00:09:43.643
the romance that is The
Faerie Queene is clearly a

00:09:43.643 --> 00:09:46.860
lot more than merely a depiction
of battles and games,

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.549
although that certainly is a
feature of it.

00:09:49.549 --> 00:09:54.284
The most characteristic feature
of the romance genre -- not just

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:58.869
in Spenser's hands but in the
hands of all Renaissance writers

00:09:58.869 --> 00:10:02.702
of romance -- the most
characteristic feature is the

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:07.287
hero or the heroine who travels
the countryside in search of a

00:10:07.287 --> 00:10:10.524
venture,
in search of an opportunity to

00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:14.593
prove his or her virtue or an
opportunity to prove his or her

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:17.487
courage.
The principal means by which

00:10:17.487 --> 00:10:21.936
the romance plot advances is
almost always by the wandering

00:10:21.936 --> 00:10:25.365
of its heroes.
Heroes and heroines wander the

00:10:25.365 --> 00:10:28.342
landscapes of romance,
and there's a lot of

00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:32.240
ideological significance
attached to this wandering.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:37.522
They rarely have set out before
them some kind of specific map

00:10:37.522 --> 00:10:42.718
or guide that will allow them to
proceed along their narrowly

00:10:42.718 --> 00:10:47.741
defined goals.The demons
that romance heroes battle and

00:10:47.741 --> 00:10:52.417
the serpents that they fend off
nearly always come as a

00:10:52.417 --> 00:10:55.615
surprise.
They're not discovered with the

00:10:55.615 --> 00:10:57.877
help of a map.
They're almost always -- and

00:10:57.877 --> 00:11:00.528
this is certainly the case in
The Faerie Queene --

00:11:00.528 --> 00:11:02.720
they're almost always
happened upon.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.096
The fact that romance heroes
have simply wandered into an

00:11:07.096 --> 00:11:11.706
adventure only proves their
virtue and their courage all the

00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:13.603
more,
once of course,

00:11:13.603 --> 00:11:18.377
they have prevailed.It's
important that Milton has waited

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:23.309
so long to explain his rejection
of the genre of the romance as

00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:26.889
the form that his great poem
would take,

00:11:26.889 --> 00:11:29.527
and that's because the
rejection of romance,

00:11:29.527 --> 00:11:32.918
I think, has everything to do,
as he's imagining it,

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:36.590
with the consequence of the
Fall in Paradise Lost.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.518
One of the most convincing
elements, I think,

00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:45.510
of Satan's temptation of Eve is
his attempt to turn her act of

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.520
disobedience into an act of
romance chivalry.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:57.355
So look at Book Nine, line 694.
Satan suggests to Eve at 694

00:11:57.355 --> 00:12:02.482
that God won't incense his ire
for such a petty trespass as

00:12:02.482 --> 00:12:05.642
eating the fruit.
Then he continues:

00:12:05.642 --> 00:12:10.283
God will "praise / rather your
dauntless virtue..."In the

00:12:10.283 --> 00:12:13.973
world of romance,
the idea of obedience isn't

00:12:13.973 --> 00:12:18.895
nearly as important as the idea
of courage, or what Satan calls

00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:23.419
here in perfect chivalric
language "dauntless virtue."

00:12:23.419 --> 00:12:29.561
Satan is essentially tempting
Eve to think of herself as a

00:12:29.561 --> 00:12:33.535
heroine of a romance,
as if he were saying,

00:12:33.535 --> 00:12:36.667
"Listen, Eve,
I don't know what you've heard,

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:40.370
but you're not a character in a
biblical tragedy.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.009
You're not a character even in
a biblical epic.

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:46.698
You're a wandering knight in a
chivalric romance,

00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:50.080
and your only job,
actually, is to prove your

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.715
courage, to prove your virtue."
Of course, Eve is dead wrong to

00:12:55.715 --> 00:13:01.414
apply the assumptions of romance
to this decidedly unromantic

00:13:01.414 --> 00:13:06.899
test of her obedience,
but for this moment of Satan's

00:13:06.899 --> 00:13:12.600
temptation, he gives us a little
glimpse into a possible

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:19.129
alternative to the story of Eve
told in the Book of Genesis.

00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:23.026
If the story of Eve had been
framed in the genre of romance

00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:25.580
rather than in the genre of
tragedy,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.996
then Eve might have been
rewarded rather than punished

00:13:28.996 --> 00:13:32.988
for her eating of the fruit.
Her courage would have been

00:13:32.988 --> 00:13:36.725
praised rather than her
disobedience blamed.So

00:13:36.725 --> 00:13:40.690
Milton rejects the genre of
romance -- of course,

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.833
he has no choice but to -- as a
viable literary mode in the

00:13:44.833 --> 00:13:47.620
description of the Fall in Book
Nine;

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.025
but he does so only after he's
made ample use -- and he's

00:13:52.025 --> 00:13:55.330
exploited it to an extraordinary
degree,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.533
I think -- ample use of the
principal movement of romance,

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:02.409
and that's the movement of
wandering.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:07.791
This poem is filled with images
of wandering as if the poem

00:14:07.791 --> 00:14:13.080
shows traces or some kind of
literary residue of the genre

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.720
that Milton decided not to write
this epic in,

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.261
the romance -- as if somewhere
inside of this biblical epic

00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:26.810
there's a romance epic,
a chivalric epic,

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:30.461
struggling to get out.
When Milton rejects the romance

00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:34.087
genre in this invocation,
he begins to alter the poem's

00:14:34.087 --> 00:14:38.115
sense of the meaning and the
poem's sense of the significance

00:14:38.115 --> 00:14:41.808
of the very activity of
wandering.So Adam and Eve --

00:14:41.808 --> 00:14:44.830
and it's incredibly depressing
if you,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:49.003
as most people have,
have grown up listening to your

00:14:49.003 --> 00:14:51.049
parents [laughs]
argue.

00:14:51.049 --> 00:14:55.021
They begin bickering about the
causes of the Fall,

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:58.911
and they lapse in to a
depressing cycle of mutual

00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:02.687
recrimination.
Adam insists that Eve fell

00:15:02.687 --> 00:15:06.520
because of the tendency she had
to wander.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.811
Look what happened!
He let her wander off yesterday

00:15:09.811 --> 00:15:12.149
morning and -- you know the
story.

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:15.792
That's essentially his
argument, and the subject of

00:15:15.792 --> 00:15:20.090
Eve's wandering becomes the
focal point of the first marital

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.139
argument after the Fall.
So Adam rejects Eve's wandering

00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:27.899
just as Milton is rejecting the
whole genre of wandering,

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:31.318
the literary form of the
romance.I think there is a

00:15:31.318 --> 00:15:35.370
way in which these two forms of
rejection are closely related.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:39.620
What's at stake with both of
these forms of rejection,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.789
these acts of rejection,
is a problem of language.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:48.781
So when Milton writes in line
twenty of the invocation that

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:52.740
he's struggling to find an
answerable style,

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.918
a style that will answer to
this new occasion,

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:58.320
the tragic occasion of the
Fall,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.905
he needs to change his style in
a way that can actually answer

00:16:01.905 --> 00:16:04.549
to the tragedy that he's about
to describe.

00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:08.363
As a literary event,
the Fall makes its biggest

00:16:08.363 --> 00:16:12.093
impact, I think,
through a change in the style

00:16:12.093 --> 00:16:15.229
of the poem,
and by that I mean there's

00:16:15.229 --> 00:16:19.334
something like a systematic
alteration of the use of certain

00:16:19.334 --> 00:16:23.509
key words.So I'm going to be
focusing for a moment on the

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:27.058
changes undergone by a
particular word -- and you've

00:16:27.058 --> 00:16:31.442
probably already guessed what it
will be -- a particular word in

00:16:31.442 --> 00:16:35.453
Paradise Lost,
although there are a number of

00:16:35.453 --> 00:16:38.852
words that seem to undergo
similar or at least closely

00:16:38.852 --> 00:16:42.828
related changes over the course
of the poem -- but here I'll be

00:16:42.828 --> 00:16:45.330
looking at the word
wander.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.834
The word wander or
wandering or some version

00:16:48.834 --> 00:16:52.092
of that word appears no fewer
than thirty-two times in

00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:54.951
Paradise Lost.
Without question,

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.759
I think, every appearance of
the word is loaded.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:02.014
The energy charging the word
wander comes from the

00:17:02.014 --> 00:17:04.572
fact, I think,
that it has embedded within it

00:17:04.572 --> 00:17:07.594
or attached to it in some way
the entire genre of the

00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:11.299
chivalric romance that,
of course, Milton has rejected.

00:17:11.299 --> 00:17:14.810
It's almost as if the word
wander is a code word for

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.964
romance.
When Milton uses the word

00:17:16.964 --> 00:17:19.572
wandering, it's
almost as if he's alluding to

00:17:19.572 --> 00:17:22.360
the Spenserian type of poem that
he rejected when he decided to

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.853
write Paradise Lost.
It's a reminder of the kind

00:17:25.853 --> 00:17:29.600
of poem that this could have
been if it hadn't been a

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.564
biblical epic.You can see a
way in which the word

00:17:33.564 --> 00:17:37.239
wandering in Paradise
Lost seems to range

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:41.562
somewhere or move perhaps back
and forth between two distinct

00:17:41.562 --> 00:17:45.332
meanings.
It's a little confusing,

00:17:45.332 --> 00:17:51.306
but I've given us something
like a schematic version of the

00:17:51.306 --> 00:17:57.074
semantic spectrum that the word
wander inhabits in

00:17:57.074 --> 00:18:01.339
Paradise Lost.
So I guess you could think

00:18:01.339 --> 00:18:04.940
of the pure or the innocent
meaning of wander as

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:08.068
purely spatial.
It is purely a spatial

00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:12.363
description of a kind of
directionless or unforced

00:18:12.363 --> 00:18:15.324
motion.
Then, the further you move to

00:18:15.324 --> 00:18:19.061
the right of the spectrum,
you get its figurative and

00:18:19.061 --> 00:18:22.560
therefore its moral meaning,
which is error:

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.639
the pejorative sense of
error,

00:18:24.639 --> 00:18:26.950
error not simply as
wandering,

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:31.149
and straying from the law,
but wandering as a divergence

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:36.036
from that which God wants you to
do -- so from a kind of pure and

00:18:36.036 --> 00:18:40.083
uncontaminated meaning to the
right of the spectrum to

00:18:40.083 --> 00:18:43.519
something much more morally
pejorative.

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:47.485
You can actually think of the
word wander as something

00:18:47.485 --> 00:18:50.922
like a chivalric knight that
undergoes its own set of

00:18:50.922 --> 00:18:54.888
adventures and challenges and
transformations over the course

00:18:54.888 --> 00:18:58.985
of this poem.So let's look
at an early instance of the word

00:18:58.985 --> 00:19:04.390
wander.
This is Book Two, line 146.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.440
This is Belial in the consult,
the great debate in hell,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.380
when Belial in Book Two ponders
the possibility of the

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.891
annihilation of the angels.
It's a horrible possibility for

00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:15.952
him.
The consequence that he

00:19:15.952 --> 00:19:20.344
imagines as most painful and
most absolutely unbearable is

00:19:20.344 --> 00:19:24.505
the possibility that his mind
will no longer be able to

00:19:24.505 --> 00:19:27.989
wander,
so Belial asks this question,

00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:32.490
this is line 146 of Book Two:
"for who would lose,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:37.301
/ Though full of pain,
This intellectual being,/ Those

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:41.660
thoughts that wander through
Eternity…"

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:45.015
Sure, Belial is a fallen angel,
and Milton goes out of his way

00:19:45.015 --> 00:19:48.259
to provide a kind of doctrinal
condemnation of everything in

00:19:48.259 --> 00:19:50.612
Belial's speech;
but there's no sense,

00:19:50.612 --> 00:19:54.250
actually, that there's anything
wrong with the general concept

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.496
of intellectual wandering.
In fact, Belial seems to be

00:19:57.496 --> 00:20:00.250
quoting Milton himself from
Areopagitica,

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.033
 in which Milton
celebrates, above all things,

00:20:03.033 --> 00:20:05.656
the right to wander -- the
right to wander through

00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:08.769
literature,
through all of one's reading

00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:13.059
and all of one's cultural
exposure without a guide.

00:20:13.059 --> 00:20:15.866
Milton writes in
Areopagitica that God

00:20:15.866 --> 00:20:19.374
gives us minds -- and he loves
this fact -- "God…

00:20:19.374 --> 00:20:23.519
gives us minds that can wander
beyond all limit and satiety."

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:28.733
The whole principle of human
wandering is given a powerful

00:20:28.733 --> 00:20:33.123
divine sanction in
Areopagitica.And so

00:20:33.123 --> 00:20:38.427
initially in Paradise Lost
we have just that kind of

00:20:38.427 --> 00:20:43.732
innocent meaning to the word
wandering as it appears

00:20:43.732 --> 00:20:48.619
early in the poem.
Look at another early instance.

00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:53.733
This is Book Four,
line 233, page 283 of the

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:56.856
Hughes.
Milton's describing here

00:20:56.856 --> 00:21:00.492
how the four rivers of paradise
spread out and travel through

00:21:00.492 --> 00:21:03.532
the earth,
how the river "divided into

00:21:03.532 --> 00:21:06.035
four main Streams,
Runs divers,

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:10.039
wand'ring many a famous Realm /
And Country."

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:12.734
So the river divides "into four
main Streams,

00:21:12.734 --> 00:21:15.368
/Runs divers,
wandring many a famous Realm /

00:21:15.368 --> 00:21:18.124
And Country."
Here it's a river that's been

00:21:18.124 --> 00:21:21.789
actually cast in the role of the
hero of a chivalric romance.

00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:23.811
Typically, of course,
it's the knight,

00:21:23.811 --> 00:21:26.762
a chivalric knight who wanders
"many a famous Realm and

00:21:26.762 --> 00:21:29.780
Country."Now,
we may be tempted to assume

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.660
that because the rivers of Eden
are wandering through the

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:38.094
countryside that there's already
a tendency toward something like

00:21:38.094 --> 00:21:42.112
moral error or straying from the
law built somehow into the

00:21:42.112 --> 00:21:45.576
landscape of the garden.
We may assume that Adam and Eve

00:21:45.576 --> 00:21:47.190
will naturally -- how could they
not?

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.475
-- stray from the proper path
of obedience if they live in a

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.370
natural world that is itself
continually straying and

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.114
wandering.
Milton invites us to make that

00:21:56.114 --> 00:22:00.042
connection but then slaps our
wrists for even entertaining it

00:22:00.042 --> 00:22:02.942
for a moment.
He uses wandering here

00:22:02.942 --> 00:22:06.584
in these early passages in an
almost aggressively innocent

00:22:06.584 --> 00:22:09.535
sense.
He simply wants to describe a

00:22:09.535 --> 00:22:13.220
nonlinear motion,
a direction that hasn't been

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:16.660
dictated or directed by a higher
power.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.380
I've made this point before,
but one of the labors of

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.529
reading Paradise Lost is
knowing when to recover,

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:28.841
and then actually trying to
recover, the purely innocent

00:22:28.841 --> 00:22:33.466
significance of some of the
poem's key words.So the idea

00:22:33.466 --> 00:22:38.013
that innocent wandering is
central to Milton's poem because

00:22:38.013 --> 00:22:42.638
the activity of wandering and
the principle of free will are

00:22:42.638 --> 00:22:47.420
so absolutely intimately
connected -- think about it.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.089
If wandering is a motion that
doesn't follow a predetermined

00:22:52.089 --> 00:22:55.630
or predestined path,
then the wanderer is

00:22:55.630 --> 00:23:00.849
necessarily always free from the
constraints of an external

00:23:00.849 --> 00:23:02.944
force,
or you could say that the

00:23:02.944 --> 00:23:04.897
wanderer is always free,
on some level,

00:23:04.897 --> 00:23:07.827
from the constraints or the
guidance even of an omnipotent

00:23:07.827 --> 00:23:10.185
God.
The very ability to wander,

00:23:10.185 --> 00:23:13.624
the right to wander,
is something like a guarantee

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:17.625
or a strong proof of one's
freedom.In Book Nine though

00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:21.906
-- this is one of the reasons
this book can be so hard to read

00:23:21.906 --> 00:23:26.819
-- the very notion of wandering
starts to come under suspicion,

00:23:26.819 --> 00:23:30.940
and there's a sense that Milton
can't afford any longer to be so

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.230
free in his talk about
wandering.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.265
"No more talk of innocent
wandering," he might have begun

00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:39.237
this book.
With the Fall,

00:23:39.237 --> 00:23:43.352
wandering is no longer
"unblam'd" or "venial," to use

00:23:43.352 --> 00:23:47.230
those words from the opening
quasi-invocation.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.240
It comes under a new set of
ethical constraints.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.556
It's almost as if wandering,
by the time you get to Book

00:23:54.556 --> 00:23:58.558
Nine, no longer has an
opportunity or the liberty to

00:23:58.558 --> 00:24:02.952
occupy the innocent or the
left-hand side of the semantic

00:24:02.952 --> 00:24:07.224
spectrum,
but it's almost entirely forced

00:24:07.224 --> 00:24:12.815
to occupy the figurative,
the moral, and specifically the

00:24:12.815 --> 00:24:19.105
morally pejorative side of that
word's meaning.So let's take

00:24:19.105 --> 00:24:24.927
a look at how that happens.
This is page 393 in the

00:24:24.927 --> 00:24:29.039
Hughes, Book Nine,
line 634.

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:33.026
Milton's describing Satan's
leading of Eve to the Tree of

00:24:33.026 --> 00:24:36.230
Knowledge, obviously a
consequential event.

00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:39.917
Eve is compared to an amazed
knight-wanderer,

00:24:39.917 --> 00:24:44.359
a knight-wanderer who has been
deluded and misled by a

00:24:44.359 --> 00:24:48.552
"wand'ring Fire."
("Wand'ring Fire" is a meteor

00:24:48.552 --> 00:24:52.829
moving across the sky.) At the
moment of the Fall,

00:24:52.829 --> 00:24:55.835
all of those wonderfully
liberating significances that

00:24:55.835 --> 00:24:59.238
had been attached to the notion
of wandering suddenly seem to

00:24:59.238 --> 00:25:01.789
just drop out of the equation
altogether,

00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:06.659
and the evil that we have no
choice but to associate with

00:25:06.659 --> 00:25:11.789
Satan starts to absorb and suck
up all of those innocent,

00:25:11.789 --> 00:25:14.790
those beautiful,
associations that the word

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:18.601
wandering had had.
So instead of a capacious

00:25:18.601 --> 00:25:22.213
semantic spectrum,
you get something like a rigid

00:25:22.213 --> 00:25:26.126
and much more fixed sense of the
meaning of this word

00:25:26.126 --> 00:25:30.717
wandering by the time we
get to the Fall.Let's look

00:25:30.717 --> 00:25:35.402
on.
This is page 404 in the

00:25:35.402 --> 00:25:42.069
Hughes, line 1134 of Book
Nine.

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:46.003
By the time Adam gets around to
blaming Eve for the Fall,

00:25:46.003 --> 00:25:50.044
and of course he does that,
the word wander has been

00:25:50.044 --> 00:25:54.118
entirely confined to the morally
pejorative part of its semantic

00:25:54.118 --> 00:25:56.373
range.
So for Adam -- and this is

00:25:56.373 --> 00:26:00.427
remarkable -- the point at which
Eve falls isn't what we know to

00:26:00.427 --> 00:26:04.041
be the point at which Eve falls,
which is the moment that she

00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:06.348
eats the fruit.
The point at which Eve falls

00:26:06.348 --> 00:26:09.513
according to Adam here is that
moment in which she wandered

00:26:09.513 --> 00:26:11.327
away.
She wandered away after their

00:26:11.327 --> 00:26:13.940
argument or their conversation
about their separation.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.210
And so he says to Eve at line
1134:

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.282
Would thou hadst
heark'n'd to my words,

00:26:21.282 --> 00:26:24.104
and stay'd
With me, as I besought thee,

00:26:24.104 --> 00:26:27.169
when that strange
Desire of wand'ring,

00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:30.818
this unhappy Morn,
I know not whence possess'd

00:26:30.818 --> 00:26:34.000
thee…
"That strange / Desire of

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.345
wandering": I think it's painful
almost to hear Adam use that

00:26:38.345 --> 00:26:41.015
phrase,
"that strange desire of

00:26:41.015 --> 00:26:45.835
wandering," as if wandering were
a concept so alien and so

00:26:45.835 --> 00:26:48.880
foreign in the world of
paradise.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:54.369
Milton tells us just above this
passage at line 1132 that Adam

00:26:54.369 --> 00:26:59.041
is speaking in an altered style.
This alteration of style is

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.145
surely, on the one hand,
just the angry tone of voice

00:27:02.145 --> 00:27:05.009
that he's using as he's speaking
to his wife,

00:27:05.009 --> 00:27:08.613
but it's also,
I think, a certain restriction

00:27:08.613 --> 00:27:12.380
of semantic possibility,
the possibility of the

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.230
significances of the words that
he's using.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:19.826
Here the word wandering
can only have its morally

00:27:19.826 --> 00:27:23.400
pejorative meaning,
and there's a sense in which

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.273
Adam is condemning not just Eve
but the whole range of freedoms

00:27:28.273 --> 00:27:33.460
that Milton had been working so
hard to establish as important,

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:39.180
actually crucial components of
his liberal universe.Well,

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.519
Eve hears this and she's right
to be perfectly aghast.

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:48.302
She's aghast not simply because
Adam is, as he is,

00:27:48.302 --> 00:27:52.317
exhibiting a kind of
surprisingly unbecoming capacity

00:27:52.317 --> 00:27:55.452
for rudeness.
It's not just the tone of voice

00:27:55.452 --> 00:27:58.550
that appalls her.
She's also appalled by the

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:03.337
altered style of Adam's speech,
by which I mean the powerfully

00:28:03.337 --> 00:28:07.710
reductive force of his talk.
Look at line 1144.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:12.633
This is Eve:
"What words have passed thy

00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:17.935
lips, Adam severe,
Imputest thou that to my

00:28:17.935 --> 00:28:22.175
default,
or" -- and you can see the kind

00:28:22.175 --> 00:28:27.539
of quotation marks that Eve is
putting in the air right now --

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:31.640
"will / Of wand'ring,
as thou call'st it."

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.400
Eve is right,
I think, to be surprised that

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.028
this altered,
this fallen use of the word

00:28:37.028 --> 00:28:39.920
wandering has passed
Adam's lips.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.569
You can almost hear her say,
"Listen: what's going on?

00:28:43.569 --> 00:28:46.500
I always thought wandering was
a good thing.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.452
Wandering is,
of course, what the rivers in

00:28:49.452 --> 00:28:52.896
paradise do, Adam,
and I thought that the right to

00:28:52.896 --> 00:28:56.622
wander is a right that we
possess as creatures of free

00:28:56.622 --> 00:29:01.031
will in a free place.
How dare you blame the Fall on

00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:06.055
wandering?"One thing
I think we can say for Eve is

00:29:06.055 --> 00:29:09.740
that she's an excellent reader
of poetry,

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.420
and like a good reader,
she's bristling here at the

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.617
suggestion that a word as
capacious as wandering is

00:29:17.617 --> 00:29:20.930
capable only of one type of
significance.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.805
There's a sense that before the
Fall, words in Milton's poems

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:28.811
had a kind of nimbleness.
There was a flexibility to

00:29:28.811 --> 00:29:31.682
them, and Milton,
as you remember,

00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:36.205
imagined his verse style as
something like the verbal

00:29:36.205 --> 00:29:41.061
equivalent of an angel's body.
His poem was a body of verse

00:29:41.061 --> 00:29:44.359
that was free of restrictive
joints and limbs of the

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:48.626
traditional rhymed couplet,
and there was a suppleness that

00:29:48.626 --> 00:29:53.205
allowed words and phrases and
whole sentences to assume a huge

00:29:53.205 --> 00:29:57.558
array of meanings just as angels
can "either sex assume" in

00:29:57.558 --> 00:30:01.987
heaven.But there's a sense
in which words seem to lose a

00:30:01.987 --> 00:30:05.440
lot of their suppleness after
the Fall,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.788
and this depressing loss of a
kind of linguistic mobility is

00:30:09.788 --> 00:30:13.863
for Milton, I think,
one of the central crises of

00:30:13.863 --> 00:30:16.386
the poem.
A word like wander

00:30:16.386 --> 00:30:20.150
suddenly begins to assume
joints and limbs.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.250
It becomes arthritic,
and its meanings become

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:27.197
restricted and reduced to a
black-and-white world of good

00:30:27.197 --> 00:30:30.157
and bad -- and it's not just
wander:

00:30:30.157 --> 00:30:35.019
there are other key words that
undergo similar transformations,

00:30:35.019 --> 00:30:36.572
slightly different
transformations,

00:30:36.572 --> 00:30:39.175
of course, because they are
different persons or different

00:30:39.175 --> 00:30:41.754
characters;
but I'm thinking of words such

00:30:41.754 --> 00:30:44.849
as fruit or error
or taste.

00:30:44.849 --> 00:30:48.438
Any of these would make an
excellent paper topic,

00:30:48.438 --> 00:30:52.923
a tracing of the history of the
word as it progresses through

00:30:52.923 --> 00:30:56.960
the poem.So words that had
been so polyvalent,

00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.835
so multifaceted,
are beginning suddenly to be

00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:05.216
concretized as moral error.
The words are becoming

00:31:05.216 --> 00:31:07.991
polarized.
They're pushed to the opposite

00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:11.333
poles of good and evil.
This move to reductive

00:31:11.333 --> 00:31:16.389
signification is seen to have,
I think -- and Milton wants us

00:31:16.389 --> 00:31:21.277
to see it as having -- some
disastrous consequences for his

00:31:21.277 --> 00:31:24.261
poem,
and one of the most disastrous

00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:28.543
consequences of the new altered
style of Paradise Lost

00:31:28.543 --> 00:31:31.970
involves the poem's new
understanding of Eve.

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:38.229
For a while it seemed possible
that the official line on sexual

00:31:38.229 --> 00:31:44.185
hierarchy was just one of the
possible readings of paradisal

00:31:44.185 --> 00:31:47.240
government.
There were at least some

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.092
suggestions -- I thought there
were at least some suggestions

00:31:51.092 --> 00:31:55.072
that there was actually a kind
of natural equality between Adam

00:31:55.072 --> 00:31:58.860
and Eve and that the matter of
hierarchy was like a cultural

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.840
imposition of an arbitrary order
onto the naturally egalitarian

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:08.132
status of their relationship,
a cultural imposition that God

00:32:08.132 --> 00:32:11.707
himself had imposed.
As you know very well,

00:32:11.707 --> 00:32:15.795
at least I have found myself
over the last couple of weeks

00:32:15.795 --> 00:32:19.954
trying to make a case for a
certain open-endedness to human

00:32:19.954 --> 00:32:23.342
relations,
to the relations between the

00:32:23.342 --> 00:32:27.720
sexes in Milton's Eden,
and I'm willing now to confess

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:32.758
-- I will confess here and now
that maybe I pushed that case a

00:32:32.758 --> 00:32:36.151
little too far.
I pushed that case of this

00:32:36.151 --> 00:32:40.102
open-endedness to the relation
between Adam and Eve a little

00:32:40.102 --> 00:32:44.119
further than the poem would
actually allow me to push it.

00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:50.551
If I have had gone too far in
that particular interpretative

00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:55.130
direction over the course of
these last,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.381
let's say, three or four
lectures, the poem now is

00:32:59.381 --> 00:33:01.632
correcting me.
My wrist is being

00:33:01.632 --> 00:33:04.372
slapped.By the time we get
to the end of Book Nine,

00:33:04.372 --> 00:33:07.315
it becomes impossible and it
becomes even impossible for me

00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:09.650
-- and I can push this stuff
pretty hard!

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:15.029
-- to maintain the case for the
gray areas or the blurred edges

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:19.911
that surround the poem's sexism.
So no more of talk,

00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:24.587
no more of Rogers' talk,
of Milton's infinitely

00:33:24.587 --> 00:33:30.112
feel-good, flexible feminism.
Your professor can now be seen

00:33:30.112 --> 00:33:34.431
to have strayed beyond the
bounds of responsible pedagogy,

00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:38.750
and perhaps you would be well
advised -- I don't know.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:42.081
It's up to you whether you
should just throw away your

00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:44.910
notes from the last three or
four lectures,

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.535
or I will advise Dan,
the cameraman,

00:33:47.535 --> 00:33:51.734
simply to erase the last three
tapes, because maybe I was

00:33:51.734 --> 00:33:55.110
entirely wrong.
After the Fall there's less and

00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:58.571
less of an alternative to
Raphael's insistence on sexual

00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:01.146
hierarchy.
Everything is much more black

00:34:01.146 --> 00:34:03.689
and white now,
and any ambivalence that may

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:07.262
have been expressed about the
justice of Eve's subjection to

00:34:07.262 --> 00:34:10.654
Adam seems simply in some way to
just disappear after the

00:34:10.654 --> 00:34:13.924
Fall.One of the divine
punishments -- and it always

00:34:13.924 --> 00:34:17.740
strikes students as kind of odd
that one of the punishments that

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:22.039
follows the Fall is the official
subjection of woman to man.

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:25.515
The Son in Paradise Lost
passes judgment on Eve,

00:34:25.515 --> 00:34:29.441
and he declares -- this is in
Book Ten: "to thy Husband's will

00:34:29.441 --> 00:34:33.070
/ Thine shall submit,
hee over thee shall rule."

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:36.389
Often we ask,
"Well, what's the big deal?

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:38.889
How is this different from
their situation before?"

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.929
But it is a big deal and this
is a punishment.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:47.138
You'll remember that Eve before
the Fall had always been in a

00:34:47.138 --> 00:34:52.521
position to choose to yield to
Adam, and here she no longer has

00:34:52.521 --> 00:34:55.256
a choice.
She just gets seized,

00:34:55.256 --> 00:34:58.929
and she's never given the
opportunity to yield.

00:34:58.929 --> 00:35:02.816
Maybe the distinction strikes
some of us as a little specious,

00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:06.299
but it's a meaningful one,
I think, to Milton.But

00:35:06.299 --> 00:35:10.154
there's more to the Fall than
just this official laying down

00:35:10.154 --> 00:35:13.573
of a new law,
a newly rigorous and newly

00:35:13.573 --> 00:35:18.502
enforced law of sexual
subordination and of involuntary

00:35:18.502 --> 00:35:21.948
sexual subjection.
Look at page 427 in the

00:35:21.948 --> 00:35:27.769
Hughes.
This is Book Ten, line 867.

00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:32.458
There's a new subjection of
language, the subjection of

00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:38.708
language to a new altered style.
In this passage we have Adam

00:35:38.708 --> 00:35:44.381
really at his most misogynist.
Eve comes to Adam to try to

00:35:44.381 --> 00:35:48.574
make amends after the Fall,
and Adam just lets loose with

00:35:48.574 --> 00:35:51.570
this powerful antifeminist
invective.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:54.500
So this is line 867 of Book
Ten:

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.643
Out of my sight,
thou Serpent,

00:35:57.643 --> 00:36:01.412
that name best
Befits thee with him leagu'd,

00:36:01.412 --> 00:36:04.050
thyself as false
And hateful;

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.530
nothing wants,
but that thy shape,

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.300
Like his, and color Serpentine,
may show

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.170
Thy inward fraud;
to warn all creatures from thee

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:17.057
Henceforth…
The Fall brings with it a new

00:36:17.057 --> 00:36:19.546
name for Eve,
Serpent, and Milton's actually

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:22.496
thinking of one of the
incredibly mean-spirited -- I

00:36:22.496 --> 00:36:26.155
think it was actually mistaken,
but it was a traditional

00:36:26.155 --> 00:36:29.634
etymology for the name
Eve which had at various

00:36:29.634 --> 00:36:33.179
points over the history of
biblical interpretation,

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:37.164
actually in the Hebrew,
was believed to have meant

00:36:37.164 --> 00:36:40.736
"serpent."
Adam here identifies Eve with

00:36:40.736 --> 00:36:45.750
the serpent, and he's providing
a significance for Eve,

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.581
the word Eve,
that drastically constricts the

00:36:48.581 --> 00:36:52.024
enormous range of meanings that
we may have associated with her

00:36:52.024 --> 00:36:54.412
up to this point,
that we were right,

00:36:54.412 --> 00:36:57.760
presumably, to associate with
her up to this point.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.969
You'll remember that in Book
Four, the waving motions of

00:37:00.969 --> 00:37:04.469
Eve's hair had been juxtaposed
implicitly with the waving,

00:37:04.469 --> 00:37:08.456
winding motions of the serpent,
and one of the points of that

00:37:08.456 --> 00:37:12.309
juxtaposition was to come to
understand that the waving,

00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:16.260
wandering motion was entirely
innocent before the Fall.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.344
It only comes to be associated
with moral error,

00:37:19.344 --> 00:37:22.429
the right-hand side of the
semantic spectrum,

00:37:22.429 --> 00:37:27.854
after the Fall.But once
again Adam suddenly reveals

00:37:27.854 --> 00:37:33.680
himself to be an abominable
reader of poetry and absolutely

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.000
incapable of nuance and
suggestiveness.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.266
He reinterprets all of the
innocent similarities between

00:37:42.266 --> 00:37:45.757
the wandering,
waviness of Eve and the serpent

00:37:45.757 --> 00:37:50.489
into something like an absolute
identification with evil.

00:37:50.489 --> 00:37:54.427
The name Eve suddenly
takes on the force of something

00:37:54.427 --> 00:37:58.338
like a morally pejorative word,
and Adam only makes his case

00:37:58.338 --> 00:38:02.242
stronger by reiterating this new
black-and-white understanding of

00:38:02.242 --> 00:38:05.350
the concept of wandering.
Get this!

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:12.900
This is line 873 of Book Ten: 
But for thee [he tells

00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.254
Eve]
I had persisted happy,

00:38:15.254 --> 00:38:18.364
had not thy pride
And wand'ring vanity,

00:38:18.364 --> 00:38:21.264
when least was safe,
Rejected my

00:38:21.264 --> 00:38:25.720
forewarning…
"Pride / and wand'ring

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.340
vanity": wandering has
practically taken on the force

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.550
of a curse word in this
sentence.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.746
It's lodged contemptuously
between "pride" and "vanity" as

00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:37.551
if out of nowhere Milton is
elevating the notion of

00:38:37.551 --> 00:38:40.579
wandering to something like the
eighth deadly sin.

00:38:40.579 --> 00:38:44.318
The very idea of wandering,
of course we know this,

00:38:44.318 --> 00:38:48.730
insists upon the importance of
ambiguity and ambivalence,

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.490
and I think it's just this
ambiguity and ambivalence that

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:56.588
Adam is really lashing out at.
He's struggling to align the

00:38:56.588 --> 00:39:00.834
concept of wandering with some
of the most hateful and some of

00:39:00.834 --> 00:39:04.871
the most misogynous impulses of
the poem.It's important

00:39:04.871 --> 00:39:09.117
though to understand that it's
not just -- and it's depressing

00:39:09.117 --> 00:39:13.432
also -- it's not just Adam who
is responsible for the reduction

00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:17.539
of Eve and the reduction of
Eve's wandering to the status of

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:21.140
moral error.
The poem itself seems to be

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.695
lending a kind of disconcerting
authority to this

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.249
misinterpretation of Eve.
I think it's a

00:39:27.249 --> 00:39:29.247
misinterpretation of Eve.
When Adam falls,

00:39:29.247 --> 00:39:33.540
the text makes clear that it's
for a very different reason from

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.321
Eve's fall.
Eve had fallen out of deception

00:39:36.321 --> 00:39:40.626
and Adam had fallen out of love.
He knew precisely what he was

00:39:40.626 --> 00:39:43.658
doing.
This is what the narrator tells

00:39:43.658 --> 00:39:48.417
us at line -- and you don't need
to turn there -- line 997 at

00:39:48.417 --> 00:39:51.590
Book Nine: Adam "scrupl'd not to
eat,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.884
/ against Against his better
knowledge, not deceiv'd,

00:39:55.884 --> 00:40:00.427
/ but But fondly overcome with
Female charm.""Fondly

00:40:00.427 --> 00:40:05.300
overcome with Female charm":
what sense does that make?

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.170
That's the narrator's
interpolation.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.631
The narrator is giving a new
authoritative interpretation of

00:40:11.631 --> 00:40:14.827
the event of the Fall,
and I think it's entirely

00:40:14.827 --> 00:40:18.260
unfair and it's not just unfair:
this is wrong.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.729
Adam falls, we know this,
because of his sense of his

00:40:21.729 --> 00:40:25.064
marital bond.
I think he's wrong to fall,

00:40:25.064 --> 00:40:30.251
actually, but it's not that he
was overcome with Eve's female

00:40:30.251 --> 00:40:33.359
charm.
He says, "Our State cannot be

00:40:33.359 --> 00:40:36.090
sever'd, we are one,
/ One Flesh;

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.010
to lose thee were to lose
myself."

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:42.837
He falls out of his sense of
connectedness with Eve,

00:40:42.837 --> 00:40:47.340
but he doesn't fall because
he's been seduced by his wife.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.934
The narrator has interpreted
Adam's fall in a way that,

00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:54.130
I think, the text itself simply
can't support.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.275
It's a central example of how
reductive interpretations aren't

00:40:58.275 --> 00:41:02.284
just to be attributed to Adam
but they're beginning actually

00:41:02.284 --> 00:41:06.293
to insinuate themselves in to
the authoritative voice of the

00:41:06.293 --> 00:41:10.099
narrator.Book Ten of
Paradise Lost is the book

00:41:10.099 --> 00:41:14.719
given to the representation of
the consequences of the Fall.

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:17.710
Given that one of the effects
of the Fall, as I've been

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.977
describing, is something like
the imaginative shrinkage that

00:41:20.977 --> 00:41:24.128
language suffers,
we shouldn't really be at all

00:41:24.128 --> 00:41:28.310
surprised by one of the early
and very strange actions in Book

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.873
Ten.
It's here that we're forced to

00:41:31.873 --> 00:41:38.247
witness the reappearance of the
debased and what I think is for

00:41:38.247 --> 00:41:44.210
this poem the entirely
inappropriate genre of allegory.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:49.190
Suddenly, as if from nowhere,
Milton re-injects into his

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:54.532
otherwise realistic poem the
decidedly unreal figures of Sin

00:41:54.532 --> 00:41:59.110
and Death.
So look at Book Ten, line 229.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:04.021
This is page 411 in the Hughes.
Milton describes the Son's

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:07.320
descent to earth to pass
judgment on Adam and Eve,

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:11.726
and at line 229 he gives us a
description of a set of events

00:42:11.726 --> 00:42:14.639
that's been happening
simultaneously.

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:16.580
He uses this
"meanwhile"-structure a few

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.769
times in Paradise Lost:
"Meanwhile,

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:24.207
ere thus was sinn'd and judg'd
on Earth, / Within the Gates of

00:42:24.207 --> 00:42:28.397
Hell sat Sin and Death."With
this use of the

00:42:28.397 --> 00:42:32.230
"meanwhile"-structure of the
narrative,

00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.855
Milton's allowing us to see the
activity of Sin and Death not

00:42:35.855 --> 00:42:38.937
happening at a later point in
the story of the Fall:

00:42:38.937 --> 00:42:42.080
it's happening at the same time
as the Fall and,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.026
in fact, it's the same event.
It's simply the same event told

00:42:45.026 --> 00:42:47.300
from a different perspective,
a different point of view,

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.341
and of course it's told within
an entirely different literary

00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:54.794
mode.
One of the consequences of the

00:42:54.794 --> 00:42:57.529
Fall has been a certain
reduction of meaning,

00:42:57.529 --> 00:43:00.947
as I've been describing,
undergone by some of the poem's

00:43:00.947 --> 00:43:03.441
key words.
And here in Book Ten,

00:43:03.441 --> 00:43:07.752
Milton constructs an entire
scene out of that literary mode

00:43:07.752 --> 00:43:11.470
traditionally most given to
reductive meanings,

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.686
and that's the mode of allegory.
It's in allegory that,

00:43:15.686 --> 00:43:20.245
when performed ham-fistedly,
you have a one-to-one

00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:24.989
correspondence between an image
and its meaning.

00:43:24.989 --> 00:43:28.064
There isn't traditionally in
allegorical writing the same

00:43:28.064 --> 00:43:30.974
kind of proliferation of
meanings that you can have in

00:43:30.974 --> 00:43:33.829
other literary modes.The
Fall is the moment,

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:37.295
of course, at which Adam and
Eve sin and the moment at which

00:43:37.295 --> 00:43:40.349
they are consigned to suffer the
penalty of death.

00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:45.670
That much we accept and is
perfectly reasonable;

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.683
but here after the Fall,
Milton chooses to represent

00:43:48.683 --> 00:43:51.991
this new introduction of Sin and
Death within the mode of

00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:55.212
allegory,
and the result has to be one of

00:43:55.212 --> 00:43:58.852
the most bathetic,
one of the most preposterous

00:43:58.852 --> 00:44:01.780
scenes in all of Paradise
Lost.

00:44:01.780 --> 00:44:07.650
It's an embarrassment.
Turn to the top of page 413 in

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:11.179
the Hughes,
line 282.

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:14.004
This is the argument:
since there will presumably be,

00:44:14.004 --> 00:44:16.503
after the Fall,
a greater deal of communication

00:44:16.503 --> 00:44:20.356
between earth and hell,
the allegorical monsters Sin

00:44:20.356 --> 00:44:24.532
and Death find themselves in the
position [laughs]

00:44:24.532 --> 00:44:29.049
of constructing an actual
bridge that will connect the

00:44:29.049 --> 00:44:32.970
earth with the home of the
fallen angels,

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.135
the hell.
So Milton represents the

00:44:35.135 --> 00:44:38.739
building of this bridge as some
massive public works project,

00:44:38.739 --> 00:44:41.636
and I think there's every
indication here that he's

00:44:41.636 --> 00:44:44.764
intending this representation to
strike us as perfectly

00:44:44.764 --> 00:44:47.950
absurd.Sin and Death begin
to build the bridge;

00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:52.822
this is line 282: 
Then Both from out Hell

00:44:52.822 --> 00:44:56.478
Gates into the waste
Wide anarchy of Chaos damp and

00:44:56.478 --> 00:44:58.106
dark,
Flew diverse,

00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:01.429
and with Power (thir Power was
great)

00:45:01.429 --> 00:45:03.510
Hovering upon the
Waters…

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.657
You'll notice here that we have
a parody of God's creation where

00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:11.804
the Holy Spirit had hovered upon
the waters of chaos and made it

00:45:11.804 --> 00:45:13.550
pregnant.
I'll continue: 

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.119
[W]hat they met
Solid or slimy, as in raging Sea

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:21.369
Tost up and down,
together crowded drove

00:45:21.369 --> 00:45:24.880
From each side shoaling towards
the mouth of Hell.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.628
As when two Polar Winds blowing
adverse [and I'm skipping around

00:45:28.628 --> 00:45:29.580
here]
…

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:33.320
[T]ogether drive
Mountains of ice…

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.933
It's a brilliant but a
grotesque travesty,

00:45:36.933 --> 00:45:41.780
a parody, of God's vitalist
creation of the universe,

00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:46.494
the process whereby impregnated
matter begins organically to

00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:50.170
organize itself into the
beautiful creation.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.889
Sin and Death -- they're
ham-fisted creators here.

00:45:54.889 --> 00:46:00.033
They can't impregnate chaos,
of course, and so they build a

00:46:00.033 --> 00:46:03.670
bridge over chaos by manhandling
chaos.

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:07.843
They force together all of the
solid and all of the slimy stuff

00:46:07.843 --> 00:46:11.343
into one huge pile.It's a
grotesque image but its

00:46:11.343 --> 00:46:14.052
grotesquery,
I think, serves an important

00:46:14.052 --> 00:46:16.893
point.
It serves as Milton's emblem

00:46:16.893 --> 00:46:21.063
for, among other things,
the process undergone by

00:46:21.063 --> 00:46:25.200
language after the Fall.
It's as if he's representing

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:28.717
the shoaling together into one
concrete block all of the

00:46:28.717 --> 00:46:32.681
diverse and all of the various
meanings associated with some of

00:46:32.681 --> 00:46:36.064
the poem's most resonant,
most beautiful and most

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:40.166
suggestive words.
Look at how Death gets all of

00:46:40.166 --> 00:46:46.079
the slippery stuff of chaos --
it's wonderfully slippery!

00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:51.240
-- to hold together in the form
of a bridge, line 293:

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:55.728
The aggregated Soil
Death with his mace petrific,

00:46:55.728 --> 00:46:58.672
cold and dry,
As with a Trident smote,

00:46:58.672 --> 00:47:02.593
and fix't as firm
As Delos [the floating island]

00:47:02.593 --> 00:47:05.190
floating once;
the rest his look

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:09.159
Bound with Gorgonian rigour not
to move,

00:47:09.159 --> 00:47:12.349
And with Asphaltick
slime…

00:47:12.349 --> 00:47:16.349
This preposterous allegorical
character, Death,

00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:20.696
has the ability to fix
something fluid and flexible

00:47:20.696 --> 00:47:24.000
into something firm and
asphaltic,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.441
and I think you have here one
of the most powerful images of

00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:32.130
the aesthetic disaster that is
fallen language.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:38.909
The extraordinary matter of
chaos is being concretized here.

00:47:38.909 --> 00:47:42.547
It's subjected to a process
exactly like the linguistic

00:47:42.547 --> 00:47:46.522
concretization undergone by a
word like wander or the

00:47:46.522 --> 00:47:49.150
words fruit or
error.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:52.414
These words begin to succumb to
a kind of linguistic rigor

00:47:52.414 --> 00:47:55.642
mortis.
They ossify into a moral

00:47:55.642 --> 00:48:00.162
rigidity that,
I think, would have seemed

00:48:00.162 --> 00:48:06.152
perfectly unthinkable to us at
an earlier stage in the

00:48:06.152 --> 00:48:12.050
poem.Okay.
I have another second.

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:14.423
We have time,
I think, for one more example:

00:48:14.423 --> 00:48:16.300
this is the punishment of
Satan.

00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:19.332
When God punishes Satan for
tempting Eve,

00:48:19.332 --> 00:48:23.578
he does so in a way that makes
literal and actual Satan's

00:48:23.578 --> 00:48:27.090
association with the serpent,
and it's really quite vulgar.

00:48:27.090 --> 00:48:30.077
Satan had, of course,
just temporarily inhabited the

00:48:30.077 --> 00:48:32.712
body of the serpent,
and God punishes Satan by

00:48:32.712 --> 00:48:35.817
turning this temporary
association into something like

00:48:35.817 --> 00:48:39.065
an actual condition.
Look at Book Ten,

00:48:39.065 --> 00:48:43.679
line fifty-five.
This is page 419.

00:48:43.679 --> 00:48:45.978
Satan is metamorphosed,
you'll remember,

00:48:45.978 --> 00:48:49.632
into a huge and hideous serpent
at the gigantic public assembly

00:48:49.632 --> 00:48:52.526
in hell,
but Milton doesn't stop at that

00:48:52.526 --> 00:48:55.489
vulgar, quasi-allegorical
representation.

00:48:55.489 --> 00:48:59.519
After that, Milton
metamorphoses all of the fallen

00:48:59.519 --> 00:49:03.467
angels into serpents,
and he places before them a

00:49:03.467 --> 00:49:06.893
grove of trees,
all of them containing the

00:49:06.893 --> 00:49:10.046
forbidden fruit,
so the fallen angels who are

00:49:10.046 --> 00:49:14.345
now serpents are all so thirsty
and so hungry that they can't

00:49:14.345 --> 00:49:18.430
help but climb the trees and try
to taste the fruit.

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.622
This is line 555: 
Yet parcht with scalding

00:49:22.622 --> 00:49:25.822
thirst and hunger fierce,
Though to delude them sent,

00:49:25.822 --> 00:49:28.773
could not abstain,
But on they roll'd in heaps,

00:49:28.773 --> 00:49:33.057
and up the Trees
Climbing, sat thicker than the

00:49:33.057 --> 00:49:35.081
snaky locks
That curled

00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:38.653
Megæra…
was one of the Furies,

00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:42.879
the feminine figures in
classical mythology who punish

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:46.865
sin, and like Medusa,
Megæra has serpents for

00:49:46.865 --> 00:49:50.702
locks of hair.
I think it's impossible to read

00:49:50.702 --> 00:49:55.197
these lines and not see in them
an incredibly unfair and ugly

00:49:55.197 --> 00:49:58.490
but embedded image of Eve.
The beautiful,

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:02.974
waving, wandering tresses of
Eve have been identified now

00:50:02.974 --> 00:50:07.699
categorically and unrepentantly
with the serpent who was her

00:50:07.699 --> 00:50:10.979
downfall.
The poem seems to go about as

00:50:10.979 --> 00:50:15.744
far as it can go in the absolute
ossification of a character into

00:50:15.744 --> 00:50:19.019
a kind of empty embodiment of
moral evil.

00:50:19.019 --> 00:50:23.082
The actual image of
metamorphosis here is merely a

00:50:23.082 --> 00:50:27.890
narrative version of a process
that we've seen occur in the

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:32.449
language of Paradise Lost
for some time now.

00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:36.014
Moral ambivalence and poetic
ambiguity has been

00:50:36.014 --> 00:50:40.510
transmogrified into something
like moral definitiveness,

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:44.411
and literary ambivalence has
become

00:50:44.411 --> 00:50:50.722
literal-mindedness.Well,
happily the poem isn't over

00:50:50.722 --> 00:50:54.673
yet,
and the grotesque reduction of

00:50:54.673 --> 00:50:59.730
Eve to evil is by no means the
poem's last words.

00:50:59.730 --> 00:51:03.441
So as you read books Eleven and
Twelve for next time,

00:51:03.441 --> 00:51:07.224
think about the literary
texture of those books as you

00:51:07.224 --> 00:51:10.650
compare it to the earlier books
of the poem.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.285
It used to be argued,
and it's an incredibly stupid

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:16.447
argument, that Milton was simply
getting old and tired by the

00:51:16.447 --> 00:51:19.556
time he got around to writing
books Eleven and Twelve -- but

00:51:19.556 --> 00:51:22.186
of course,
he went on to write Samson

00:51:22.186 --> 00:51:25.883
Agonistes and Paradise
Regained, magnificent works

00:51:25.883 --> 00:51:28.130
of art.
There is nonetheless a marked

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:31.165
change in the verbal character
of the last two books of

00:51:31.165 --> 00:51:34.221
Paradise Lost.
So think about the

00:51:34.221 --> 00:51:39.490
implications of the altered
style of the book's conclusion.

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:40.490
Okay.

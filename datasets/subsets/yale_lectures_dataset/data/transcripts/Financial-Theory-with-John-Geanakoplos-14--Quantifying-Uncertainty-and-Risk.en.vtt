00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.860
Prof: We've dealt so far
with the case of certainty,

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.690
and we've done almost as much
as we could in certainty,

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.590
and I now want to move to the
case of uncertainty,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.484
which is really where things
get much more interesting and

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:21.760
things can go wrong.
 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.490
So I'm going to cover this.
 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.189
So we're ready to start.
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.020
So, so far we've considered is,
the case of certainty.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.330
So with uncertainty things get
much more interesting,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.145
and I want to remind you of a
few of the basics of

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:45.960
mathematical statistics that I'm
sure you know.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:00.408
So you know we deal with random
variables which have uncertain

00:01:00.408 --> 00:01:11.780
outcomes, but with well-defined
probabilities.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.084
So another step that we're not
going to take in this course is

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:18.495
to say people just have no idea
what the chances are something's

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:19.580
going to happen.
 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.333
Shiller thinks we live in a
world like that where who knows

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.659
what the future's going to be
like and people,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.055
they hear a story and then
everybody gets wildly

00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:28.864
optimistic,
and then they hear some

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:30.958
terrible story and then
everybody gets wildly

00:01:30.958 --> 00:01:33.705
pessimistic,
and that kind of mood swing can

00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:35.370
affect the whole economy.
 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.879
I'm not going to deal with that.
 

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:40.287
It's hard to quantify and I'm
not exactly sure it's as

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.280
important as he thinks it is.
 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.325
So we're going to deal with the
case where many things can

00:01:45.325 --> 00:01:47.235
happen,
but you know what the chances

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:50.141
are that they could happen,
and still lots of things can go

00:01:50.141 --> 00:01:51.129
wrong in that case.
 

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:55.312
So there are a couple of words
that I want you to know,

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:59.959
which we went over last time,
and I'll just do an example.

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.469
We always deal with states of
the world, states of nature.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:04.819
That was Leibniz's idea.
 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.513
So let's take the simplest case
where with probability 1 half

00:02:08.513 --> 00:02:11.405
you could get 1,
and with probability 1 half you

00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:12.759
could get minus 1.
 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.449
So that's a random variable.
 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.810
It might be how your investment
does.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.258
Half the time you're going to
make a dollar.

00:02:19.258 --> 00:02:21.199
Half the time,
you're going lose a dollar.

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:26.964
So this is X,
so we define the expectation of

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:29.502
X,
which I write as X bar,

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:33.348
as the probability of the up
state happening,

00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:36.240
so let's just call that 1 half
times 1,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.889
1 half times minus 1 which
equals 0.

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:46.443
Then I define the variance of X
to be, what's the expectation of

00:02:46.443 --> 00:02:51.229
the squared difference from the
expectation?

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.530
So how uncertain it is.
 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.887
You're sort of on average
expecting to get 0,

00:02:54.887 --> 00:02:57.513
so uncertain it is,
is measured how far from 0 you

00:02:57.513 --> 00:02:59.550
are, but we're going to square
it.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.752
So it's 1 half times (1 - X
bar) squared 1 half times (minus

00:03:05.752 --> 00:03:11.537
1 - X bar) squared = 1 half
times 1 1 half times 1 which

00:03:11.537 --> 00:03:13.430
also equals 1.
 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.370
So the variance is 1.
 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.171
And then I'll write the
standard deviation of X equals

00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:23.477
the square root of the variance
of X, which equals the square

00:03:23.477 --> 00:03:25.628
root of 1 which is also 1.
 

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:29.199
So very often we're going to
use the expectation of X,

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.128
that's going to be how good the
thing is,

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:35.150
and the standard deviation is
going to be how uncertain it is,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.497
and people aren't going to
like--soon we're going to

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:40.306
introduce the idea that people
don't like uncertainty and this

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:42.150
is the measure of what they do
like.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.574
It pays off on average a big
number, say, this one doesn't

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:48.157
but it could,
and the measure of uncertainty

00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:49.960
is the standard deviation.
 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.638
I choose that rather than the
variance for a reason you'll

00:03:52.638 --> 00:03:52.919
see.
 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.669
It makes all the graphs
prettier, but also if you double

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.692
X you'll double the expectation,
obviously, because you just

00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:03.008
double everything inside here.
 

00:04:03.008 --> 00:04:05.631
The variance,
though, you're going to end up

00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:06.788
squaring the two.
 

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:11.729
If you double X you'll double
all these outcomes and the mean,

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.330
so you'll end up multiplying
the variance by 4,

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.009
whereas you'll multiply the
standard deviation by 2.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.141
So re-scaling just re-scales
these two numbers and has a

00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:21.850
funny effect on that number.
 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.290
So that's the reason why we use
these two.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.932
Now, you could take another
example, by the way,

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:34.170
which is .9 times 3
[correction: .9 times 1 third];

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:43.819
let's call this Y,
and .1 times minus something.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:49.209
How about let's call this 1
third and this minus 3.

00:04:49.209 --> 00:04:51.569
Now, what's the expectation of
Y?

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:58.079
The expectation of Y equals .3,
right,

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:06.408
equals--just write it out,
it's .9 times 1 third .1 times

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:13.399
minus 3 which equals .3 - .3
which equals 0,

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:16.656
so the expectation of this
random variable is the same as

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.100
the expectation of that random
variable.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.778
And now the variance of this,
of Y,

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:31.370
is .9 times (1 third - 0)
squared .1 times (minus 3 - 0)

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.115
squared,
which equals .9 times 1 ninth,

00:05:37.115 --> 00:05:47.425
right,
.1 times 9 which equals .1 .9

00:05:47.425 --> 00:05:54.322
which equals 1,
which is the same as the other

00:05:54.322 --> 00:05:54.569
one.
 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.362
So here we've got another
random variable which looks

00:05:57.362 --> 00:06:01.252
quite different from this,
so clearly standard deviation

00:06:01.252 --> 00:06:04.709
and expectation don't
characterize things.

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:08.579
This looks quite different from
that one, has the same standard

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:10.889
deviation and the same
expectation.

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:13.557
So we're going to come back
what the difference is between

00:06:13.557 --> 00:06:15.149
these two variables in a second.
 

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:19.601
So there's another thing I want
to introduce which is the

00:06:19.601 --> 00:06:21.509
covariance of X and Y.
 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.810
So we could look at the
outcomes of these variables.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:26.920
Where am I going to write this?
 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.350
I'll write it over here.
 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.620
We could look at the outcome of
these variables in a picture

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.529
like this, and so here we have X
and here we have Y.

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:42.016
So X could turn out to be 1
when Y is 1 third,

00:06:42.016 --> 00:06:47.990
and X could turn out to be 1
when Y is minus 3.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.348
So here's an outcome,
and here's an outcome,

00:06:51.348 --> 00:06:55.252
and X could be minus 1,
and we could get 1 third or

00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.190
minus 3.
 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.940
So there are four outcomes
looked at here.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.692
So if you looked at X alone
it's got a 50/50 chance you're

00:07:03.692 --> 00:07:04.680
here or here.
 

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.040
If you look at Y alone it's a
90 percent chance up there and a

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.750
10 percent chance down there.
 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.735
So those are called the
marginal distributions,

00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:21.129
but the joint distribution we
would have to add a number.

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:23.089
So if you looked at X alone,
by the way,

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:26.569
you would say X alone you would
say here's 0,

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:31.084
here's 1, here's minus 1,
so you could have this or this

00:07:31.084 --> 00:07:35.930
with probability 1 half and 1
half and Y you could have--

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.389
so we'll draw it this way.
 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:43.269
With Y you could have 1 third
or minus 3 and here the

00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:47.680
probability is going to be .9
and .1.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.519
This is 0.
 

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:53.079
Those are the pictures that we
started with.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:56.269
So you know where X could end
up and where Y could end up,

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:59.350
well, you don't know where they
jointly could end up.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.656
So if they end up on the long
diagonal that means when X is

00:08:03.656 --> 00:08:08.187
high Y tends to be high and vice
versa, and if you end up down

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.490
here X is low and Y is low.
 

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.872
So to the extent that the
probability is on the long

00:08:13.872 --> 00:08:16.459
diagonal they're correlated
together.

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.942
To the extent that the
probability is on the off

00:08:18.942 --> 00:08:21.110
diagonal they're negatively
correlated.

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.930
So anyway, to get a sense of
that,

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:33.360
the covariance is going to be
the probability of (1,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:43.227
1 third) times (1 - X bar)
times (1 third - Y bar) the

00:08:43.227 --> 00:08:49.041
probability of--
I'll just go around the circle

00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:56.336
of (minus 1,
1 third) times (minus 1 - X

00:08:56.336 --> 00:09:10.225
bar) times (1 third - Y bar) the
probability of (minus 1 and 1

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:13.600
third),
sorry what did I just do?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.019
I did minus 1 and 1 third.
 

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:16.480
I've already done that,
so I'm down here.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.450
So (minus 1 and minus 3) times
(minus 1 - X bar) times (minus 3

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.879
- X bar [correction:
Y bar]) probability of the

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:30.503
ordered pair--
Student: Should that

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:32.429
minus be the X bar or Y bar?
 

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:33.529
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:38.125
And probability,
what's the point I haven't done

00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:44.190
yet, (1, minus 3) times (1 - X
bar) times (minus 3 - Y bar).

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.940
So why does that covariance
pick up the idea of correlation?

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.721
Well, to the extent that the
probabilities are high here and

00:09:51.721 --> 00:09:55.697
over there on the long diagonal
this term is going to get a lot

00:09:55.697 --> 00:10:01.057
of weight,
and what is the other term,

00:10:01.057 --> 00:10:04.097
(minus 1,
minus 3), and this term is

00:10:04.097 --> 00:10:05.538
going to get a lot of weight.
 

00:10:05.538 --> 00:10:07.726
So to the extent that you're on
the long diagonal this term and

00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:09.350
this term are going to get a lot
of weight,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.976
but you see those terms this is
going to be positive because

00:10:12.976 --> 00:10:16.360
it's 1 - 0 and 1 third - 0,
so that's a positive term.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.342
And this is negative,
minus 1 - 0,

00:10:18.342 --> 00:10:20.866
minus 3 - 0,
so a negative times a negative

00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:22.129
is also positive.
 

00:10:22.129 --> 00:10:24.791
To the extent that you're down
here and up there you're going

00:10:24.791 --> 00:10:26.918
to get big positive numbers in
the covariance.

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.092
To the extent you're on the off
diagonal you'll get big

00:10:30.092 --> 00:10:32.971
probabilities here,
but they all multiply negative

00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:33.558
terms.
 

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:36.494
This is a minus and this is a
minus, because one of terms is

00:10:36.494 --> 00:10:39.129
above the mean and the other one
is below the mean.

00:10:39.129 --> 00:10:40.620
That's what it means to be in
the off diagonal.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:44.229
So covariance is giving you a
sense of whether things are

00:10:44.229 --> 00:10:47.129
moving together or moving the
opposite way.

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:49.340
So those are the basic things
you have to know.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.658
And I guess another couple
things are,

00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:54.779
the covariance is linear in X,
right,

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:59.475
because if you double X every
time you see the X variable over

00:10:59.475 --> 00:11:03.168
here it's always an X outcome
minus an X bar,

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:06.038
an X outcome minus an X bar,
an X outcome minus an X bar,

00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:08.788
an X outcome minus an X bar,
so if you double X you're going

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:09.860
to double every term.
 

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:19.346
So it's linear in X and in Y,
and so one last thing to keep

00:11:19.346 --> 00:11:29.162
in mind is that the variance of
X is just the covariance of X

00:11:29.162 --> 00:11:31.778
with itself.
 

00:11:31.778 --> 00:11:35.594
Obviously if you just plug in X
equal to Y you just get the

00:11:35.594 --> 00:11:39.080
formula for covariance
[correction: for variance],

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.620
and similarly because they're
linear the covariance of X Y--

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.259
so the variance of X Y,
one more formula,

00:11:48.259 --> 00:11:54.222
of X Y by linearity--first of
all that's the covariance of X Y

00:11:54.222 --> 00:11:57.058
with itself,
and therefore by linearity now,

00:11:57.058 --> 00:11:58.649
I'm just going to do linear
stuff,

00:11:58.649 --> 00:12:06.719
that's equal to the covariance
of X with X the covariance of Y

00:12:06.719 --> 00:12:12.538
with Y 2 times the covariance of
X with Y.

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:16.245
Since it's linear I just do the
linear parts,

00:12:16.245 --> 00:12:16.918
right?
 

00:12:16.918 --> 00:12:20.410
Covariance of X Y with X Y is
covariance of X Y with X

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.836
covariance of X Y with Y,
then I repeat the linearity

00:12:23.836 --> 00:12:26.009
thing and I get down to that.
 

00:12:26.009 --> 00:12:33.120
So those are basically the key
formulas to know.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:38.240
So now I'm going to make three
little observations that come

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.145
out of all of this that are
quite fascinating,

00:12:42.145 --> 00:12:44.230
so quite elementary.
 

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.480
Are there any questions about
this, these numbers?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.110
Yes?
 

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.852
Student: I don't
understand why you gave the

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:53.527
probability of (negative 1,
negative 3) weight when

00:12:53.527 --> 00:12:58.639
negative 3 has a much more
probability of being hit on that

00:12:58.639 --> 00:12:59.610
1 third.
 

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.769
Prof: Why did we give?
 

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:01.639
Say that again.
 

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:04.273
Student: Why did you
underline the probably of

00:13:04.273 --> 00:13:05.538
negative 1, negative 3.
 

00:13:05.538 --> 00:13:07.330
Prof: Probably of
negative 1, negative 3.

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:09.590
That's this outcome here.
 

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:12.499
We underlined it not because it
was very likely,

00:13:12.499 --> 00:13:15.470
but because this term is going
to be positive.

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.168
This is positive and this is
positive.

00:13:17.168 --> 00:13:27.923
So the whole point is the joint
distribution is not specified,

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:36.916
not determined by the
distributions of X alone and Y

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.678
alone.
 

00:13:38.678 --> 00:13:42.769
So even if I know the
probability of what X could do,

00:13:42.769 --> 00:13:45.522
and I know what the
probabilities that Y could do

00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:48.961
that doesn't tell me anything
about what numbers I should put

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.509
on these four outcomes.
 

00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:54.057
For example,
I could have at one extreme

00:13:54.057 --> 00:13:59.244
when X is high Y is high--it
can't be exactly that because

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:02.519
the probabilities are different.
 

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:08.635
These numbers and those numbers
don't determine these four

00:14:08.635 --> 00:14:09.710
numbers.
 

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.780
So there are many different
numbers I could put in these

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.000
four squares which would give me
in total this probability

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.590
outcome for X and in total this
probability outcome for Y.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.918
So an easy way to see that is
if I made them.

00:14:26.918 --> 00:14:39.029
So what are the observations I
want to make?

00:14:39.029 --> 00:14:42.764
For instance,
I could say if X turns out to

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:48.279
be 1 half then I'll always
assume Y turns out to be 1 half,

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.392
and then with the other 40
percent of the time Y might turn

00:14:51.392 --> 00:14:56.976
out to be--
when Y's high X might have to

00:14:56.976 --> 00:15:00.119
turn out--
so here are some ways I could

00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:00.519
do this.
 

00:15:00.519 --> 00:15:05.519
I could put 50 percent here,
.5 here right?

00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:10.158
Then 40 percent of the time
this is going to turn out--so I

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:13.678
have a .5 here,
then what could I do with the

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:15.038
rest of this?
 

00:15:15.038 --> 00:15:21.950
This plus this has to add up to
50 percent.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:32.340
So 50 percent I could have X
turn out to be here.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.299
So when X is 1 I could have Y
always turn out to be 1,

00:15:36.299 --> 00:15:39.589
so that means I must have a
probability here,

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:43.548
a probability 0 here because
here's X 50 percent.

00:15:43.548 --> 00:15:46.489
So this plus this X is going to
turn out to be 1,50 percent of

00:15:46.489 --> 00:15:47.019
the time.
 

00:15:47.019 --> 00:15:51.494
Now, how much of the time is Y
going to turn out to be down

00:15:51.494 --> 00:15:52.418
here a .1?
 

00:15:52.418 --> 00:15:54.975
So suppose I put these
probabilities,

00:15:54.975 --> 00:15:55.330
.4?
 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:16:00.061
Now, so you see that X is--50
percent of the time X is 1,

00:16:00.061 --> 00:16:03.610
and 50 percent of the time X is
minus 1.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.899
Now, how many of the times is Y
1 third, .5 .4,

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:13.214
so 90 percent of the time,
and then 10 percent of the time

00:16:13.214 --> 00:16:14.798
Y is minus 3.
 

00:16:14.798 --> 00:16:18.544
So here's one way of putting
probabilities on the dots that

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:21.931
produces this outcome,
but I could have chosen another

00:16:21.931 --> 00:16:24.355
way of doing it,
the way that you probably had

00:16:24.355 --> 00:16:26.860
in mind where I assume they're
totally independent.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.244
That is, knowing the outcome of
X in this way of doing it,

00:16:30.244 --> 00:16:33.865
if I know that X turned out to
be 1, Y has to turn out to be a

00:16:33.865 --> 00:16:34.460
third.
 

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.870
So they're very dependent.
 

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.298
X is somehow causing Y or
determining Y.

00:16:38.298 --> 00:16:40.269
X has a lot of information
about Y.

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:41.590
Suppose I make them independent?
 

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:43.740
I say what happens here has
nothing to with what happens

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:44.250
over there.
 

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:49.765
Then I write the probabilities,
instead of these,

00:16:49.765 --> 00:16:51.950
I'd write it .45.
 

00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:57.928
I'd take 1 half times .9 is
.45, and then the chance that

00:16:57.928 --> 00:17:05.833
you go down for X,
which is .5 and up for Y which

00:17:05.833 --> 00:17:14.228
is also .45 here,
then I'd go .05 here and .05

00:17:14.228 --> 00:17:15.430
there.
 

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:19.234
So here, knowing that Y has a
good outcome tells you nothing

00:17:19.234 --> 00:17:21.170
about what X is going to do.
 

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.470
It's still equally likely X was
good or bad.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:27.851
Knowing that Y had a bad
outcome, X is still likely to be

00:17:27.851 --> 00:17:30.118
equally likely good or bad.
 

00:17:30.118 --> 00:17:33.413
And similarly knowing the
outcome of X tells you nothing

00:17:33.413 --> 00:17:34.910
about the outcome of Y.
 

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:37.720
This is 9 times this and this
is 9 times that.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:44.976
So the yellow is independence,
which is probability ((X equals

00:17:44.976 --> 00:17:48.343
x),
and (Y equals y)),

00:17:48.343 --> 00:17:53.603
equals the product,
Probability (X = x) times

00:17:53.603 --> 00:17:55.420
probability (Y = y).
 

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.390
So that's the case in
independence.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.204
So in the case of independence,
knowing something about one

00:17:59.204 --> 00:18:01.020
variable tells you nothing about
what happened to the other

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:03.124
variable,
but you could do other joint

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:03.598
things.
 

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:07.151
So knowing each of them
separately doesn't tell you how

00:18:07.151 --> 00:18:10.884
they're jointly distributed,
and the covariance is an effort

00:18:10.884 --> 00:18:14.162
to see whether they're sort of
correlated together or whether

00:18:14.162 --> 00:18:16.130
they're correlated
independently.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.077
So independence,
by the way, independence

00:18:21.077 --> 00:18:24.788
implies covariance equals 0.
 

00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:27.999
That's obvious because what's
happening in the X variable's

00:18:27.999 --> 00:18:31.318
got nothing to do with what's
happening in the Y variable.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:34.394
So since it's linear in X you
can hold Y fixed,

00:18:34.394 --> 00:18:38.338
and the X is just the same and
you're going to get something

00:18:38.338 --> 00:18:39.808
that adds up to 0.
 

00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:42.654
So for any fixed value of Y
this number will just give you

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:45.051
the expectation of X,
which won't depend on Y and

00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:46.900
it's going to be 0 in every
case.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.665
So therefore if they're
independent their covariance has

00:18:49.665 --> 00:18:50.170
to be 0.
 

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.900
So, independence means X and Y
tell you nothing.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.548
That means the covariance is 0.
 

00:18:55.548 --> 00:18:58.368
They could be positively
distributed like up here or

00:18:58.368 --> 00:19:01.410
negatively distributed,
either way you want to do it.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.980
Does that make sense?
 

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:05.259
You asked me about this.
 

00:19:05.259 --> 00:19:07.058
Student: Yes.
 

00:19:07.058 --> 00:19:11.093
Prof: So what are the
key simple observations here

00:19:11.093 --> 00:19:14.767
that are going to inform a lot
of our behavior under

00:19:14.767 --> 00:19:15.920
uncertainty?
 

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:23.660
Well, it's going to turn out
that expectation is good and

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:27.528
standard deviation is bad.
 

00:19:27.528 --> 00:19:33.548
So if we take this variable
that we just found,

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:40.088
X and Y were both here,
X and Y were both there.

00:19:40.088 --> 00:19:44.182
All right, they each had
standard deviation 1 and

00:19:44.182 --> 00:19:47.336
expectation 0,
so this is the standard

00:19:47.336 --> 00:19:48.529
deviation.
 

00:19:48.529 --> 00:19:52.401
So X is here,
and by the way so is Y,

00:19:52.401 --> 00:19:53.798
same thing.
 

00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:58.140
Well, suppose I put half my
money into X and I put half my

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.337
money into Y,
and if I put half my money in

00:20:01.337 --> 00:20:05.068
each let's say I get half the
payoff of each.

00:20:05.068 --> 00:20:07.579
I make half a bet and get half
the outcome.

00:20:07.579 --> 00:20:12.920
What happens to my expectation?
 

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.842
Well, the expectation of that
obviously equals 1 half X bar 1

00:20:19.842 --> 00:20:23.650
half Y bar which also equals 0.
 

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.558
So it's staying the same.
 

00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:35.211
The expectation hasn't moved,
but what's the variance of 1

00:20:35.211 --> 00:20:38.259
half X 1 half Y?
 

00:20:38.259 --> 00:20:42.692
Well, by that formula it's the
covariance--so I'm just going to

00:20:42.692 --> 00:20:43.980
do this formula.
 

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:49.500
I'm going to a 1 half here and
1 half here.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.910
So it's the same thing.
 

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:56.558
So it's the covariance of 1
half X with 1 half X the

00:20:56.558 --> 00:21:01.298
covariance of 1 half X 1 half Y
1 half and 1 half.

00:21:01.298 --> 00:21:07.105
But the covariance of 1 half X
with 1 half X is just,

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:09.450
okay, what is that?
 

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.630
It's the variance of 1 half X,
but we already saw from our

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.640
definition of variance over
here,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.500
remember, if you double X
you're going to multiply the

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.038
variance by 4 because you're
squaring things.

00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:27.577
So this is going to turn out to
be 1 quarter times the variance

00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:28.430
of X.
 

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.446
And this, which is 1 half Y and
1 half Y, is going to be 1

00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:36.440
quarter times the variance of Y.
 

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:40.140
And if the two are independent
the covariance will be 0.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.950
So in this example,
these two variables,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:46.128
if I take the orange
distribution where they're

00:21:46.128 --> 00:21:49.931
independent I can do an X
outcome and have this standard

00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:53.932
deviation and this expectation,
0 expectation and that standard

00:21:53.932 --> 00:21:55.694
deviation,
I can do the Y thing,

00:21:55.694 --> 00:21:59.051
get the same standard deviation
or I can put half my money in

00:21:59.051 --> 00:21:59.500
each.
 

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.961
It seems like a total waste of
time to put half my money in

00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:03.380
each.
 

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.747
After all, they give me the
same standard deviation,

00:22:05.747 --> 00:22:06.630
but no, it isn't.
 

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.977
If they're independent you're
shockingly, drastically reducing

00:22:10.977 --> 00:22:12.828
your standard deviation.
 

00:22:12.828 --> 00:22:16.558
Because if they're independent
the covariance is 0 and so this

00:22:16.558 --> 00:22:20.146
plus this plus,
the variance of X = the

00:22:20.146 --> 00:22:26.421
variance of Y is just the half
the variance of X = half the

00:22:26.421 --> 00:22:28.259
variance of Y.
 

00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:29.210
So that's shocking.
 

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.827
So the standard deviation,
therefore, the square root of

00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:35.000
that is 1 over the square root.
 

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.355
So by putting half your money
in each you've now produced this

00:22:38.355 --> 00:22:39.838
when they're independent.
 

00:22:39.838 --> 00:22:47.976
So this is the standard
deviation of 1 half X 1 half Y,

00:22:47.976 --> 00:22:51.140
(X, Y) independent.
 

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:54.048
You move from this point to
that point.

00:22:54.048 --> 00:22:56.835
You reduced your standard
deviation without affecting your

00:22:56.835 --> 00:22:57.519
expectation.
 

00:22:57.519 --> 00:23:01.890
So the first lesson that we're
going to see applied,

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.578
this is all mathematics so
mathematicians understood this,

00:23:05.578 --> 00:23:08.374
of course, a long time ago,
but to realize this has an

00:23:08.374 --> 00:23:10.799
application to economics wasn't
so obvious,

00:23:10.799 --> 00:23:12.619
although Shakespeare knew it.
 

00:23:12.619 --> 00:23:15.940
It's diversification.
 

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.659
So don't put all your,
you know, spread your

00:23:18.659 --> 00:23:21.190
investments out into different
waters.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.769
Shakespeare,
you know, Antonio had a

00:23:23.769 --> 00:23:27.269
different ship on each ocean,
so instead of putting all the

00:23:27.269 --> 00:23:29.630
ships on the same ocean he put
them on different oceans which

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.808
he assumed was independent.
 

00:23:30.808 --> 00:23:33.916
So he had the same expected
outcome assuming the paths were

00:23:33.916 --> 00:23:36.808
just as quick to wherever he was
selling the stuff,

00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:39.271
the same expected outcome and
that each of the waters were

00:23:39.271 --> 00:23:42.640
equally dangerous,
but he drastically reduced his

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.460
variance.
 

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.650
And because there were a lot of
oceans and a lot of ships this

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:48.690
number went down further and
further.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:51.390
So the key is to look for
independent risks.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:54.586
So that's one lesson in
mathematics that has a big

00:23:54.586 --> 00:23:56.349
application in economics.
 

00:23:56.349 --> 00:24:01.170
What's a second thing?
 

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:06.188
Well, the second thing is that
if you add a bunch of risks

00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:10.150
together, so I'm going to say
this loosely.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.996
If you add a bunch of risks
together, so by the way,

00:24:13.996 --> 00:24:18.068
what's the generalization of
this before I say this?

00:24:18.068 --> 00:24:29.041
If you had N independent risks
with identical means and

00:24:29.041 --> 00:24:40.422
variances, means let's call them
all X bar and variances,

00:24:40.422 --> 00:24:44.078
sigma squared.
 

00:24:44.078 --> 00:24:48.820
Let's say they all have
expectation E and variance sigma

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.835
squared,
each of them has that,

00:24:51.835 --> 00:24:55.585
then what happens to the--
so each of them has standard

00:24:55.585 --> 00:24:57.210
deviations,
so they're all identical.

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:59.686
Like X and Y have the
expectation 0 and the same

00:24:59.686 --> 00:25:00.900
standard deviation 1.
 

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:06.522
Suppose I had 20 of those and I
put 1 twentieth of money into

00:25:06.522 --> 00:25:07.930
each of them?
 

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:14.788
What would happen to my
expectation?

00:25:14.788 --> 00:25:22.144
1 over N dollars in each one
implies what happens to my

00:25:22.144 --> 00:25:28.000
expectation if expectation equal
to what?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.019
Each of them had expectation E.
 

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:33.028
I now split my money among all
of them, all with the same

00:25:33.028 --> 00:25:33.779
expectation.
 

00:25:33.779 --> 00:25:36.950
That also has to have
expectation E.

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:40.076
All right, just like this thing
putting half my money in Y and

00:25:40.076 --> 00:25:42.230
half my money in X,
wherever the X went.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.240
Y was over here.
 

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.180
X is there.
 

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:49.007
Half my money in X and half my
money in Y, is going to give me

00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:50.450
the same expectation.
 

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.730
If I had 12 projects like that
that were independent I'd still

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.058
have the same expectation,
but my standard deviation,

00:25:58.058 --> 00:26:03.278
what's going to happen to my
standard deviation?

00:26:03.278 --> 00:26:13.099
Well, the variance is going to
be--so what's going to happen to

00:26:13.099 --> 00:26:17.058
the standard deviation?
 

00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:18.990
Student: It would go
down.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:24.009
Prof: By what factor?
 

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:27.180
Yeah, what's going to happen to
the variance?

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.230
Student: 1 over...
 

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:34.303
Prof: Put 1 over N
dollars in each of N identical

00:26:34.303 --> 00:26:39.470
but independent investments,
what will my variance be?

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.190
Student: &lt;&lt;over
lapping conversation&gt;&gt;

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:45.766
Prof: The variance is
going to equal 1 over N times

00:26:45.766 --> 00:26:46.769
sigma squared.
 

00:26:46.769 --> 00:26:47.598
Why is that?
 

00:26:47.598 --> 00:26:50.346
Because each one will have 1
over N dollars in it,

00:26:50.346 --> 00:26:53.596
so its variance is going to be
1 over N squared times sigma

00:26:53.596 --> 00:26:55.670
squared, but there are N of
them.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:57.980
So it's going to be N over
times 1 over N squared,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:05.109
so it's just 1 over N,
so implies the standard

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:09.343
deviation--
so I'll call it standard

00:27:09.343 --> 00:27:13.387
deviation,
is 1 over the square root of N

00:27:13.387 --> 00:27:14.670
times sigma.
 

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:16.240
So it's just this
generalization.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.595
We've got 1 over the square
root of 2, so if I did N of them

00:27:18.595 --> 00:27:20.990
instead of 2 of them I'd have 1
over the square root of N.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.990
So those turn out to be very
useful formulas which are going

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:25.670
to come up over and over again.
 

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.750
And let's just say it again so
you get this straight.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.990
If I have two independent
random variables,

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:34.038
and I split my money evenly
between them,

00:27:34.038 --> 00:27:36.150
and they have the same
expectation,

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:38.630
it doesn't have to be 0,
it could be a positive number,

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:41.282
if I split my money between
them I haven't changed my

00:27:41.282 --> 00:27:43.923
expectation because each dollar,
however I split it,

00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:46.490
I'm putting it into something
with the same expectation.

00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:51.738
But because they're independent
you get a lot of off diagonal

00:27:51.738 --> 00:27:53.400
things happening.
 

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.519
The off diagonal things,
remember, are canceling.

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:59.077
One investment is turning out
well, X is--sorry that's on the

00:27:59.077 --> 00:27:59.730
diagonal.
 

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.875
The off diagonal elements are
good in a way because if one

00:28:02.875 --> 00:28:06.077
investment's turning out well,
sorry, turning out badly the

00:28:06.077 --> 00:28:07.900
other one's turning out well.
 

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.458
So here investment Y is turning
out badly, but X is turning out

00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:11.858
well.
 

00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:15.643
So to the extent you're off the
diagonal you're canceling some

00:28:15.643 --> 00:28:19.490
of your bad outcomes because
one's good and the other's bad.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.175
So that way you leave the
expectation the same,

00:28:23.175 --> 00:28:25.578
but you reduce the variance.
 

00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:29.111
In fact it would be even better
if you could put everything on

00:28:29.111 --> 00:28:31.497
the off diagonal,
but to the extent you get at

00:28:31.497 --> 00:28:33.909
least some stuff on the off
diagonal you're reducing the

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:34.259
risk.
 

00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:37.048
And how fast do you reduce it
when they're independent?

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:40.819
You reduce it dividing it
equally because the variance is

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:43.414
a squared thing,
half your money in one and half

00:28:43.414 --> 00:28:45.961
in the other means the variance
of the first is 1 quarter and

00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:47.828
the variance of the second is 1
quarter,

00:28:47.828 --> 00:28:50.237
but now there are two of them
so the total variance is 1 half

00:28:50.237 --> 00:28:51.200
of what it was before.
 

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.522
If you have 10 of them each one
is 1 tenth the money so it's got

00:28:54.522 --> 00:28:57.517
1 one-hundredth of the variance,
but there are 10 of them so

00:28:57.517 --> 00:29:00.308
it's 10 one-hundredths,
1 over N of the variance.

00:29:00.308 --> 00:29:02.952
If you take the standard
deviation it's 1 over the square

00:29:02.952 --> 00:29:03.519
root of N.
 

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:10.758
So that's the rate at which you
can reduce your uncertainty and

00:29:10.758 --> 00:29:12.160
your risk.
 

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.558
You'll see this gets much more
concrete next lecture.

00:29:15.558 --> 00:29:18.788
So this is just stuff that most
of you know.

00:29:18.788 --> 00:29:23.180
So one more thing,
if you add a bunch of

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:28.720
independent things together,
independent random variables,

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.618
so I'm going to speak very
loosely now,

00:29:31.618 --> 00:29:46.788
variables, you get a normally
distributed random variable,

00:29:46.788 --> 00:29:58.622
normally distributed random
variable with the corresponding

00:29:58.622 --> 00:30:06.170
expectation and standard
deviation.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:07.680
So what am I saying?
 

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.157
I don't want to speak too
precisely about this because if

00:30:10.157 --> 00:30:12.769
you've seen this before and seen
a proof you know everything

00:30:12.769 --> 00:30:14.732
about it,
if you haven't it's just too

00:30:14.732 --> 00:30:16.028
many subtleties to absorb.
 

00:30:16.028 --> 00:30:20.540
But the normal distributed
random variable's the bell curve

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:22.329
that looks like that.
 

00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:26.980
It looks like this.
 

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.710
So there's the bell curve with
expectation 0.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:31.250
So it's this bell curve.
 

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:34.516
Now, what's special about it,
it has a particular formula

00:30:34.516 --> 00:30:37.900
which has got an exponential to
a minus X squared thing.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.125
Anyway, it's got a particular
formula to it which if you know

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:41.720
you know, if you don't it's
written down.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.431
We're never going to use the
exact formula,

00:30:43.431 --> 00:30:44.450
but it looks like that.
 

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.949
So these are the outcomes X and
this is the probability,

00:30:48.949 --> 00:30:53.038
probability of outcome,
or frequency of outcome.

00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:57.151
So the bigger X is,
and this is the mean--equals

00:30:57.151 --> 00:30:59.950
0--I've assumed the mean is 0.
 

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.980
If you take a really big X it's
very unlikely to happen,

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:04.838
and a really small X it's very
unlikely to happen,

00:31:04.838 --> 00:31:07.650
and X's nearer the mean are
pretty likely to happen.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.893
So anyway, it's amazing that if
you add this random variable to

00:31:11.893 --> 00:31:15.795
itself a bunch of times it can
only produce 1 and minus 1,

00:31:15.795 --> 00:31:16.480
right?
 

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:19.259
This one produces totally
different outcomes,

00:31:19.259 --> 00:31:24.160
1 third and minus 3,
they're disjoint outcomes,

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.642
but if you add this together
you can get 25 1s and 10 minus

00:31:29.642 --> 00:31:32.578
1s,
so that gives you 15.

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:38.054
Over here you could have--25
will never get me there,

00:31:38.054 --> 00:31:41.740
so sorry, that was a bad
example.

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.318
If I had 30 things I could get
18 1s and 12 minus 1s,

00:31:46.318 --> 00:31:49.565
that'll give me 6,
you could have gotten 6 over

00:31:49.565 --> 00:31:52.371
here,
but with 30 outcomes you could

00:31:52.371 --> 00:31:54.153
get,
you know, all 30 of them could

00:31:54.153 --> 00:31:56.978
have turned out to be 1,
and that would have gotten you

00:31:56.978 --> 00:31:58.868
pretty close to the same
outcome.

00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:02.759
So just because these outcomes
are separate,

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:05.546
once you're adding them up
you're starting to produce

00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:07.690
numbers different from 1 and
minus 1,

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:10.471
and these added up--if you take
the right combination of 1 third

00:32:10.471 --> 00:32:12.588
and minus a third--
you can start reproducing

00:32:12.588 --> 00:32:12.970
things.
 

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.673
Like to get a 1 here you could
produce three tops and then

00:32:16.673 --> 00:32:18.170
you're producing a 1.
 

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:20.729
So anyway, the shocking thing
is if you add a bunch of these

00:32:20.729 --> 00:32:23.071
random variables that are
independent to each other you

00:32:23.071 --> 00:32:25.414
get something normally
distributed that looks like that

00:32:25.414 --> 00:32:27.887
because this random variable had
exactly the same mean and

00:32:27.887 --> 00:32:29.058
standard deviation.
 

00:32:29.058 --> 00:32:31.295
You add the same number of
these you're going to get

00:32:31.295 --> 00:32:33.529
outcomes that are almost
identically distributed.

00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:36.535
So in the limit this random
variable, enough of these added

00:32:36.535 --> 00:32:39.538
together looks exactly the same
as these added together.

00:32:39.538 --> 00:32:42.578
That's the second surprising
mathematical fact.

00:32:42.578 --> 00:32:46.116
And the third thing that we're
going to use is that the normal

00:32:46.116 --> 00:32:50.058
distribution is characterized by
the mean and standard deviation,

00:32:50.058 --> 00:32:52.710
that's all it takes to write
the formula of this down,

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:57.828
and these numbers,
these are called thin tailed.

00:32:57.828 --> 00:33:02.578
These probabilities go to 0
very fast, so you shouldn't

00:33:02.578 --> 00:33:06.890
expect many outlying dramatic
things to happen.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:10.238
And in the world they do
happen, and so we're going to

00:33:10.238 --> 00:33:13.776
see that much of classical
economics is built on normally

00:33:13.776 --> 00:33:16.618
distributed things and so you
can't see--

00:33:16.618 --> 00:33:19.585
you shouldn't expect any
gigantic outliers to ever

00:33:19.585 --> 00:33:20.130
happen.
 

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:23.228
And it seems natural to build
it on that kind of assumption

00:33:23.228 --> 00:33:26.432
because if you add things that
are independent you get normal

00:33:26.432 --> 00:33:28.088
distributions all the time.
 

00:33:28.088 --> 00:33:31.165
And things seem independent so
why shouldn't you get normal

00:33:31.165 --> 00:33:33.287
distributions,
and yet we must not get it

00:33:33.287 --> 00:33:35.250
because we have so many
outliers.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:38.259
So that's the basic background
of mathematics.

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:40.009
Are there any questions about
any of that?

00:33:40.009 --> 00:33:48.213
I'm just assuming you know all
that and now we're going to move

00:33:48.213 --> 00:33:50.200
to economics.
 

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.279
I think that's all the
background you need.

00:33:55.279 --> 00:34:03.596
I want to do one more thing,
which is maybe background,

00:34:03.596 --> 00:34:12.684
but it's used in economics all
the time, and it's called the

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:16.690
iterated expectations.
 

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:22.019
So if I told you that these
variables were correlated like

00:34:22.019 --> 00:34:25.001
these up here,
like the orange things,

00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:28.753
if I told you what X turned out
to be that would tell you a lot

00:34:28.753 --> 00:34:30.690
about what Y was going to be.
 

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.545
So for example,
if I told you that X

00:34:33.545 --> 00:34:37.869
was--sorry, the white ones are
the correlated ones.

00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:43.949
If I tell you that X has turned
out to be 1, that tells you that

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:49.931
Y has to be a good outcome of 1
third, because if X is one this

00:34:49.931 --> 00:34:51.670
never happens.
 

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.356
So the only thing that can
happen if X is 1 is that Y turns

00:34:54.356 --> 00:34:56.722
out to be 1 third,
so knowing X is going to

00:34:56.722 --> 00:34:59.969
completely change your mind
about the expectation of Y.

00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:04.639
So conditional expectation,
I should have said this before,

00:35:04.639 --> 00:35:19.452
conditional expectation simply
means re-computing expectation

00:35:19.452 --> 00:35:32.289
using updated probabilities from
your information.

00:35:32.289 --> 00:35:34.266
Now, you've probably done this
in high school,

00:35:34.266 --> 00:35:36.639
so I'm just going to assume you
know how to do this.

00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:40.744
So in this case if I tell you
something like X has turned out

00:35:40.744 --> 00:35:45.329
to be 1 that tells you that only
these two outcomes are possible.

00:35:45.329 --> 00:35:48.615
So that means that the only two
outcomes in the white case have

00:35:48.615 --> 00:35:50.789
happened with probability of .5
and 0,

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:53.773
but if I tell you X has come
out to 1 the conditional

00:35:53.773 --> 00:35:55.840
probabilities have to add up to
1.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.268
So you just scale things up.
 

00:35:57.268 --> 00:36:02.679
So you know that Y had to have
been the good outcome up here.

00:36:02.679 --> 00:36:08.148
If I tell you that the bad
outcome for Y has happened then

00:36:08.148 --> 00:36:14.289
you have probabilities of .1--so
this 0 makes things too easy.

00:36:14.289 --> 00:36:21.210
Suppose I tell you the good
outcome of Y has happened.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.027
What are the chances now that X
has gotten the good outcome in

00:36:26.027 --> 00:36:28.320
the white probability case?
 

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.525
If I tell you that Y turned out
to be 1 third in the white

00:36:31.525 --> 00:36:34.842
probability case what's the
probability that X turned out to

00:36:34.842 --> 00:36:36.530
be 1, conditional on that?
 

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.179
Student: 5 ninths.
 

00:36:37.179 --> 00:36:38.898
Prof: 5 ninths,
so that's it,

00:36:38.898 --> 00:36:41.847
because the probabilities are
now--you're reduced with .4 and

00:36:41.847 --> 00:36:43.369
.5 so 5 ninths of the time.
 

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:46.668
So that's an idea which I
assume you all can--it's very

00:36:46.668 --> 00:36:50.333
intuitive, and it's way too long
to explain, and I'm sure you

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.800
know how to do that.
 

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.157
So anyway, the conditional
expectation, blah,

00:36:54.157 --> 00:36:56.570
so the iterated expectation is
simply this.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:36:58.858
It's an obvious idea,
but it's going to be incredibly

00:36:58.858 --> 00:36:59.518
useful to us.
 

00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:03.190
It says if you ask me what are
the chances that the Yankees are

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:06.329
going to win the World Series
against the Dodgers--

00:37:06.329 --> 00:37:07.719
let's suppose that's who's
going to play--

00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:09.349
the Yankees are going to beat
the Dodgers,

00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:11.929
what's the probability that's
going to happen?

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:16.929
What do you expect the chances
are?

00:37:16.929 --> 00:37:20.920
If I then ask you my opinion
after the first game,

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:23.065
well, obviously if the Yankees
win the first game my opinion's

00:37:23.065 --> 00:37:24.639
going to go up,
so I'm going to have a

00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:25.449
different opinion.
 

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:28.871
If the Dodgers win the first
game my opinion is going to go

00:37:28.871 --> 00:37:31.289
down, so I'll have a different
opinion.

00:37:31.289 --> 00:37:36.036
But you can ask now another
question, what's your expected

00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:37.869
opinion going to be?
 

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:42.483
So the law of iterated
expectations is,

00:37:42.483 --> 00:37:49.404
the expectation of X has to
equal the expected expectation

00:37:49.404 --> 00:37:53.289
of X given some information.
 

00:37:53.289 --> 00:37:54.780
So here is what I think.
 

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.369
The Yankees are 70 percent
likely to win.

00:37:57.369 --> 00:37:58.717
If I say after the first game
[clarification:

00:37:58.717 --> 00:38:00.250
if the Yankees win]
I'll think it's 80 percent,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:04.659
and after the first game if the
Dodgers win I'll think it's gone

00:38:04.659 --> 00:38:07.498
down to 65 percent,
it had better be that the

00:38:07.498 --> 00:38:10.719
average of my opinions after the
information is the same as the

00:38:10.719 --> 00:38:12.018
number I started with.
 

00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:15.833
That's just common sense and
I'm not going to bother to prove

00:38:15.833 --> 00:38:16.280
that.
 

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.659
So that's incredibly important.
 

00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:20.010
It's not only the expectation
of X,

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:22.878
but as you learn stuff you can
anticipate your opinion's going

00:38:22.878 --> 00:38:26.775
to change,
but your average opinion has to

00:38:26.775 --> 00:38:30.059
always stay the same as X was.
 

00:38:30.059 --> 00:38:34.289
So that's the last of the
background.

00:38:34.289 --> 00:38:39.170
And now I want to do a simple
application of this.

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:44.244
So in fact, to that very
question, suppose that you're

00:38:44.244 --> 00:38:46.639
playing a World Series.
 

00:38:46.639 --> 00:38:53.896
The Yankees are playing the
Dodgers and let's suppose that

00:38:53.896 --> 00:39:01.409
the Yankees have a 60 percent
chance of winning any game.

00:39:01.409 --> 00:39:03.710
I'll just do it here.
 

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.599
The Yankees have a 60 percent
chance of winning any game.

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:12.909
What's the chance the Yankees
win a 3 game world series?

00:39:12.909 --> 00:39:14.469
How do you figure that out?
 

00:39:14.469 --> 00:39:17.507
Well, a naive way,
a simple way of figuring that

00:39:17.507 --> 00:39:20.159
out is to say,
well, what could happen?

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:23.891
Life can mean a Yankee win,
let's call that an up,

00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:26.938
or a Yankee loss,
let's call that a down,

00:39:26.938 --> 00:39:30.900
and this could happen with
probability .6 or .4.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:36.730
The Yankees could win again,
so that's probability .6.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.601
We have two Yankee wins,
or the Yankees could lose the

00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:43.449
second game so that's
probability .4.

00:39:43.449 --> 00:39:45.420
The Yankees could lose or could
win.

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:51.599
That's .6 and this is .4,
and we've only played 2 games.

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:53.170
The Yankees could win a
third--well,

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.436
you don't need to play this
game because they've already won

00:39:55.436 --> 00:39:59.400
a three game series,
but if you did it wouldn't

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:08.369
matter, .4,
or we could go up or down.

00:40:08.369 --> 00:40:11.134
The Yankees after winning and
losing could then win

00:40:11.134 --> 00:40:13.373
probability .6,
or could lose,

00:40:13.373 --> 00:40:18.255
or after losing and winning
they could win again or they

00:40:18.255 --> 00:40:19.500
could lose.
 

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.465
After losing and winning they
could lose, so this is

00:40:22.465 --> 00:40:25.898
probability .4 and this is .6,
and then finally we have this

00:40:25.898 --> 00:40:27.119
and we have this.
 

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:28.610
So this is .6 and .4.
 

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:30.380
So this is what the tree looks
like.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:34.637
You could imagine 8 possible
paths each of length 3 where you

00:40:34.637 --> 00:40:37.829
give the whole sequence of wins
and losses.

00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:41.735
So to compute the probability
that the Yankees win you look at

00:40:41.735 --> 00:40:44.489
all the--so in this case the
Yankees win.

00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:46.369
They would have already won
here, but if you play it out it

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:46.920
doesn't matter.
 

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.480
They're going to win here and
here.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.699
They've got two wins and one
loss.

00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:53.300
Here they've got one win,
two wins and one loss.

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:53.889
They win.
 

00:40:53.889 --> 00:40:56.760
Here they've got loss, win, win.
 

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.869
They win the World Series.
 

00:40:57.869 --> 00:40:59.630
Here they lose, win, lose.
 

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:01.010
They lose the World Series.
 

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.922
Here's lose,
win--it's win,

00:41:02.922 --> 00:41:06.309
lose, lose, they also lose the
World Series.

00:41:06.309 --> 00:41:08.570
Here it's lose,
lose, they've lost the World

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:09.360
Series, loss.
 

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:11.579
So these are the possible
outcomes.

00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:15.039
So you could compute the
probability of every path,

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:17.139
there are 8 of them,
and then multiply that

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:20.139
probability by the outcome and
you'll get the chance that the

00:41:20.139 --> 00:41:22.090
Yankees will win the World
Series,

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:23.550
right?
 

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:24.699
That's clear to everybody?
 

00:41:24.699 --> 00:41:29.153
But there's a much faster way
of doing it and putting it on a

00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:33.980
computer, and that's using the
law of the iterated expectation.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:39.210
So first of all--so this is
called a tree.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.050
So we're going to use trees all
the time.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:43.409
So tree, I don't want to
formally define it.

00:41:43.409 --> 00:41:46.869
It's just you start with
something and stuff can happen.

00:41:46.869 --> 00:41:49.527
Stuff happens every period,
and so you just write down all

00:41:49.527 --> 00:41:50.880
the things that can happen.
 

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.126
And then you write down all the
things that can happen after

00:41:53.126 --> 00:41:54.690
that and the thing unfolds like
a tree.

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:57.159
That's formal enough to
describe a tree and here we've

00:41:57.159 --> 00:41:57.579
got it.
 

00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:00.400
But you notice that the tree
the number of things happening

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:01.469
grows exponentially.
 

00:42:01.469 --> 00:42:04.635
It's horrible to have to
compute something growing

00:42:04.635 --> 00:42:07.413
exponentially,
but they're often recombining

00:42:07.413 --> 00:42:08.059
trees.
 

00:42:08.059 --> 00:42:10.371
Oh, so if I ask,
by the way, in this tree

00:42:10.371 --> 00:42:15.097
whatever the opinion is here,
which turns out to be .68

00:42:15.097 --> 00:42:17.436
something,
yeah, I should have asked you

00:42:17.436 --> 00:42:19.079
to guess,
.68 something.

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:22.130
If you write down the opinion
that opinion has to be the

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.960
average of the opinion here and
the opinion here.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.726
So if I take the opinion here
times .6 plus the opinion here

00:42:29.726 --> 00:42:33.119
times .4 that's also going to
equal .68.

00:42:33.119 --> 00:42:38.570
And that's what's going to be
the key to computing the thing

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:43.927
much faster rather than going
through every branch which is

00:42:43.927 --> 00:42:49.748
such a pain because there are an
exponentially growing number of

00:42:49.748 --> 00:42:52.583
paths,
very bad to have to compute by

00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:52.909
hand.
 

00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:59.630
But we notice that we can look
at a recombining tree.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:03.090
These two nodes are essentially
the same.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:06.996
What difference does it make if
the Yankees win one and lose

00:43:06.996 --> 00:43:09.050
one, or lose one and win one?
 

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:13.320
In both cases they're at the
same spot.

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:14.869
They're even in the World
Series.

00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:17.554
And since we assume the
probability of winning any game

00:43:17.554 --> 00:43:19.530
is the same,
.6 and .4, independent of

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.025
what's happened before--
you might think you're learning

00:43:22.025 --> 00:43:24.150
something about,
"Oh, their starter pitched

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:26.126
here and he didn't last the
whole game,"

00:43:26.126 --> 00:43:27.159
and stuff like that.
 

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:28.469
So I'm not allowing for any of
that.

00:43:28.469 --> 00:43:31.005
I'm just saying it's a (.6,
.4) chance for the Yankees to

00:43:31.005 --> 00:43:32.320
win no matter what happens.
 

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:37.240
So all you care about at any
point from then on is who's won

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:38.659
how many games.
 

00:43:38.659 --> 00:43:41.360
So these nodes are basically
identical,

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.523
and these nodes are identical,
because it all ended up with

00:43:44.523 --> 00:43:47.297
the Dodgers ahead 2 to 1,
and here the Yankees were ahead

00:43:47.297 --> 00:43:48.768
2 to 1,
and here the Yankees were ahead

00:43:48.768 --> 00:43:49.920
3 to 0,
and 0 to 3.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:44:02.014
So the recombining tree which
has all the same information is

00:44:02.014 --> 00:44:09.070
just this, this,
this, this tree.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.110
So this three only has 1,2,
3,4,

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:15.853
5, has far--it's 1 node,
2 nodes, 3 nodes and 4 nodes as

00:44:15.853 --> 00:44:20.510
time goes by growing linearly
instead of growing 1,

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:24.010
to 2, to 4, to 8 which is
growing exponentially.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:30.824
So I could have a very long
World Series and write it as a

00:44:30.824 --> 00:44:37.159
finite tree and just .6 and .4
here at every stage.

00:44:37.159 --> 00:44:39.639
So how am I going to solve this
now?

00:44:39.639 --> 00:44:42.570
Well, over here I know the
Yankees ended up winning all 3

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:42.989
games.
 

00:44:42.989 --> 00:44:44.697
Here they won 2,
here they won 1,

00:44:44.697 --> 00:44:45.820
here they won none.
 

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:47.030
So those are the outcomes.
 

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:50.699
So instead of trying to figure
out path by path,

00:44:50.699 --> 00:44:52.927
through these exponential
number of paths what the chances

00:44:52.927 --> 00:44:55.722
of each path are,
why it's hard to compute here,

00:44:55.722 --> 00:44:59.521
it's .6 times .6 times .4,
a complicated calculation,

00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:02.329
I'm now going to do something
simple.

00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:04.407
I'm going to say,
what would I think if the

00:45:04.407 --> 00:45:06.090
Yankees had already won 2 games?
 

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.960
Well, I know that they would
win.

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:09.559
That's a 1.
 

00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:10.880
The series is already over.
 

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.960
What would I think after the
Dodgers won the first two games?

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.429
I'd know it was over.
 

00:45:15.429 --> 00:45:18.369
What would I think--so how did
I get that?

00:45:18.369 --> 00:45:21.909
It's .6 times 1 .4 times 1.
 

00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:26.532
That's 1, the Dodgers .6 times
0 .4 times 0 that's 0,

00:45:26.532 --> 00:45:30.980
so that's my opinion if the
Dodgers win 2 games.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:33.380
Here's my opinion if the
Yankees won 2 games.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:36.929
What would my opinion be if
they split?

00:45:36.929 --> 00:45:41.409
Well, if they split what would
my opinion be if I started here?

00:45:41.409 --> 00:45:44.989
So after game 2 they've each
won 1 game.

00:45:44.989 --> 00:45:47.460
I don't know who won the first
one, but it was 1 to 1 after 2

00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:47.789
games.
 

00:45:47.789 --> 00:45:49.429
Now what would I think?
 

00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:51.440
Student: .6 times 1 .4
times 0.

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.159
Prof: Exactly,
so it's .6.

00:45:53.159 --> 00:45:55.460
It's .6 times 1 .4 times 0.
 

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.755
So the odds,
I would think,

00:45:56.755 --> 00:45:59.697
the Yankees would win the World
Series here with 1 game left

00:45:59.697 --> 00:46:02.539
knowing that they win 60 percent
of the time it's .6.

00:46:02.539 --> 00:46:06.320
But now what do I think if the
Yankees win the first game?

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.050
What's my opinion?
 

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.309
Student: .6 times 1 .4
times .6.

00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:12.880
Prof: So it's .6 times
1,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:17.909
so it's .6 .4 times .6,
so that's .24,

00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:21.530
so that's .84 here,
and what's my opinion after the

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.150
Yankees lose the first game and
the Dodgers win?

00:46:25.150 --> 00:46:32.289
What do I think is going to
happen?

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:35.840
What will my opinion be here?
 

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:42.402
It's .6 times having an opinion
of .6, so it's .36 .4 times

00:46:42.402 --> 00:46:46.929
knowing that it's all over .4
times 0.

00:46:46.929 --> 00:46:52.090
So it's equal to .36.
 

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:55.465
So I've now figured out--not
only am I solving this thing

00:46:55.465 --> 00:46:58.539
much faster than I could over
there, but I'm finding

00:46:58.539 --> 00:47:00.650
interesting numbers on the way.
 

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.173
I'm now figuring out what would
I think after the Yankees won

00:47:03.173 --> 00:47:03.889
the first game?
 

00:47:03.889 --> 00:47:05.579
Well, now I think it's 84
percent.

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:07.909
What would I think after the
Dodgers won the first game?

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:10.862
I'd think it was only a 36
percent chance of the Yankees

00:47:10.862 --> 00:47:11.400
winning.
 

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:17.130
So now what's my opinion at the
very beginning?

00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:24.173
It's .6 times .84 (it's my
chance of having this opinion

00:47:24.173 --> 00:47:31.090
plus my chance of having that
opinion) .4 times .36.

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:43.230
Oh no, 504 (maybe) 144 what is
that?

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:44.650
Student: .648.
 

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:49.826
Prof: .648,6 times 84
looks like 504 and 4 times 36

00:47:49.826 --> 00:47:53.458
looks like 144,
so it looks like .648 and

00:47:53.458 --> 00:47:55.730
that's what you said.
 

00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:56.469
So that's it.
 

00:47:56.469 --> 00:47:59.460
I've solved it now.
 

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.759
So that's the method of
iterated expectation and we're

00:48:02.759 --> 00:48:06.929
going to turn this into quite an
interesting theory in a second,

00:48:06.929 --> 00:48:10.755
but I want to now put that on a
computer to show you just how

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:14.164
completely obvious this is,
I mean, not obvious,

00:48:14.164 --> 00:48:15.210
fast this is.
 

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:20.994
So you could solve for any
number of--a series of any

00:48:20.994 --> 00:48:24.889
length you could instantly
solve.

00:48:24.889 --> 00:48:27.349
Now, we're going to price bonds
that way too.

00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:40.510
So class--so what did I do?
 

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:43.360
I--this is a spreadsheet you
had.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.302
I simply had the probabilities
of the Yankees winning which was

00:48:47.302 --> 00:48:49.018
.6, which I could change.
 

00:48:49.018 --> 00:48:50.199
Student: Can you lower
the screen?

00:48:50.199 --> 00:48:52.340
Prof: Oh.
 

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.010
Student: Thank you.
 

00:48:53.010 --> 00:49:17.159
 
 

00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:19.760
Prof: So this is the
simplest thing to do,

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:23.844
but now suppose that--so we
said the Yankees can win every

00:49:23.844 --> 00:49:25.780
game with probability .6.
 

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:27.320
So then what did I do?
 

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.239
I went down to here.
 

00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:30.679
I gave myself some room.
 

00:49:30.679 --> 00:49:32.889
I didn't do a very long series.
 

00:49:32.889 --> 00:49:35.820
So now what does each of these
things say?

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.797
Each of these nodes,
like that one,

00:49:37.797 --> 00:49:40.878
says, if I can read it,
it says--so this is my opinion

00:49:40.878 --> 00:49:42.739
of winning the World Series.
 

00:49:42.739 --> 00:49:46.550
It says my opinion here is
going be the chance I go up.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.829
That's the probability,
that's A 2,

00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:53.427
that's .6, the chance I go up
times what my opinion would be

00:49:53.427 --> 00:49:56.797
over here,
plus the chance that I go down,

00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:59.807
which is here,
the chance I go to here which

00:49:59.807 --> 00:50:02.760
is 1 minus that number .6 that's
frozen up there,

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.480
times whatever I thought would
be my opinion here.

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.989
So you see that's the same--I
just write that once.

00:50:08.989 --> 00:50:11.836
I wrote that once here,
that thing about the

00:50:11.836 --> 00:50:16.010
probability, my opinion there is
the probability of going up.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.760
That's S A, dollar A dollar 2,
that's .6,

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.976
it's frozen,
times what my opinion would be

00:50:22.976 --> 00:50:27.572
and the square over 1 and up 1
plus 1 minus dollar A dollar 2

00:50:27.572 --> 00:50:30.559
times my opinion over 1 and down
1.

00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:33.824
So I just copied that as many
times I wanted to down the

00:50:33.824 --> 00:50:37.150
column and then I copied it
again across all the rows.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:39.625
So all of these entries are
identical, they're all just

00:50:39.625 --> 00:50:40.679
copies of each other.
 

00:50:40.679 --> 00:50:43.969
So it's just says iterate your
opinion from what you know it

00:50:43.969 --> 00:50:44.750
was forward.
 

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.650
Now, how do I take a 3 game
World Series?

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:50.420
Well, we're starting here.
 

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.429
This'll be game 1,
game 2, game 3,

00:50:53.429 --> 00:50:59.449
so all I have to do now is put
1s everywhere here like 1 enter,

00:50:59.449 --> 00:51:02.380
and now I'll copy this,
ctrl, copy,

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:07.260
and go all the down here.
 

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.079
So that's it.
 

00:51:08.079 --> 00:51:09.599
So we've got all the numbers.
 

00:51:09.599 --> 00:51:10.780
So why is that?
 

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.280
Because my opinion
here--remember the numbers we

00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:13.599
got?
 

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:15.820
The series goes 1 game,
2 games, 3 games,

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:18.873
so if you end up above the
middle that means the Yankees

00:51:18.873 --> 00:51:20.539
won the majority of games.
 

00:51:20.539 --> 00:51:21.780
Your pay off is 1.
 

00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.670
Your probability of the Yankees
wining is 1.

00:51:24.670 --> 00:51:29.219
So now what's your opinion
going to be?

00:51:29.219 --> 00:51:32.940
If you've won 2 games then the
Yankees have to have won.

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.889
What if the Yankees win the
first game?

00:51:34.889 --> 00:51:37.865
Remember the numbers we got 1,
and .6, and 0,

00:51:37.865 --> 00:51:39.219
so here's the .84.
 

00:51:39.219 --> 00:51:40.730
It's the average of 1 and .6.
 

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:46.090
Here's the .36 which was the
average of .6 and 0.

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:49.449
And then we come down to the
middle which is .648.

00:51:49.449 --> 00:51:54.570
So what do I do if I want to
play a 7 game World Series?

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:58.764
I have to get rid of this,
and if it's a 7 game World

00:51:58.764 --> 00:52:01.773
Series I would just--
now I want to restore what I

00:52:01.773 --> 00:52:06.347
had before,
so I'm going to copy all this,

00:52:06.347 --> 00:52:10.449
ctrl,
copy, ctrl.

00:52:10.449 --> 00:52:11.789
So I'm back to where I was
before.

00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:14.260
So you see what I'm doing here?
 

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.800
The game hasn't started.
 

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.652
This is the first game,
second game,

00:52:17.652 --> 00:52:20.139
third game, fourth game,
fifth game, sixth game,

00:52:20.139 --> 00:52:21.039
seventh game.
 

00:52:21.039 --> 00:52:24.235
Every square is just saying my
opinion is my average of what my

00:52:24.235 --> 00:52:25.679
opinion will be next time.
 

00:52:25.679 --> 00:52:29.344
If I want to make it a 7 game
World Series I just plug in 1s

00:52:29.344 --> 00:52:29.780
here.
 

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.347
There must be some faster way
of doing this,

00:52:32.347 --> 00:52:33.780
but I plug in 1s here.
 

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:37.949
So ctrl, copy and here are all
the 1s down to above the thing,

00:52:37.949 --> 00:52:42.010
ctrl V, and now I've solved my
opinion backwards and I've got

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.733
the chances of the Yankees
winning a 7 game World Series

00:52:45.733 --> 00:52:47.018
are 71 percent.
 

00:52:47.018 --> 00:52:49.969
So the longer the World Series
goes the better the chances are

00:52:49.969 --> 00:52:52.920
the Yankees win if they're
better in each individual game,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.309
and you can do it instantly.
 

00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:58.829
So are there any questions
about that?

00:52:58.829 --> 00:53:03.000
So that is a trick we're going
to use over and over again to

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:03.989
price bonds.
 

00:53:03.989 --> 00:53:07.255
You do it by backward induction
because of the law of iterated

00:53:07.255 --> 00:53:08.059
expectations.
 

00:53:08.059 --> 00:53:11.117
Your opinion today of what's
going to happen way in the

00:53:11.117 --> 00:53:14.117
future when you get a lot of
information has to be the

00:53:14.117 --> 00:53:17.173
average opinion you're going to
have after you get some

00:53:17.173 --> 00:53:19.637
information,
but before you know what the

00:53:19.637 --> 00:53:20.530
final outcome is.
 

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:24.108
And so realizing that,
you just take the pieces of

00:53:24.108 --> 00:53:28.565
information one by one and work
backwards from the end and you

00:53:28.565 --> 00:53:33.021
can solve things instantly which
would take in the brute force

00:53:33.021 --> 00:53:37.329
way an exponentially growing
length of time to do if you did

00:53:37.329 --> 00:53:39.230
them path by path.
 

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:42.630
I now want to turn to an
application of this to one

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:45.690
subject, which is,
let's just not do the World

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.440
Series.
 

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.760
Let's do a more interesting
problem.

00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.829
I hope I have time to finish
this story.

00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:57.809
So the more interesting problem
is this.

00:53:57.809 --> 00:54:11.750
Let's suppose our uncertainty's
of a different kind.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.199
Instead of not knowing the
outcome of the World Series

00:54:15.199 --> 00:54:18.260
let's say we don't know how
impatient we are.

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:21.159
So remember the most important
idea so far that we've seen,

00:54:21.159 --> 00:54:23.429
because we haven't done
uncertainty yet,

00:54:23.429 --> 00:54:26.380
the most important idea we've
seen so far is impatience.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:29.688
That's the reason why you get
an interest rate and the

00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:32.873
interest rate is the key to
finding out the value of

00:54:32.873 --> 00:54:33.809
everything.
 

00:54:33.809 --> 00:54:37.829
So Irving Fisher put tremendous
weight on impatience.

00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:40.889
And now that we're talking
about uncertainty the natural

00:54:40.889 --> 00:54:44.340
thing to make uncertain is how
impatient you're going to be.

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:50.039
So we want to talk a little bit
more about impatience.

00:54:50.039 --> 00:55:01.239
So impatience by Irving Fisher
is the discount.

00:55:01.239 --> 00:55:05.809
So in fact I want to talk about
this in sort of realistic terms.

00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:09.050
Do we really believe that
people just discount the future,

00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:13.565
1 year they discount by delta,
2 years discount by delta

00:55:13.565 --> 00:55:16.184
squared,
3 years by delta cubed,

00:55:16.184 --> 00:55:18.570
4 years by delta to the fourth.
 

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:23.418
Is it really true that every
year people think of as delta

00:55:23.418 --> 00:55:26.480
less important as the year
before?

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.153
I mean, the argument for this
is you might not live beyond a

00:55:30.153 --> 00:55:33.509
certain--
you know, poor imagination,

00:55:33.509 --> 00:55:36.217
so imagination,
poor imagination,

00:55:36.217 --> 00:55:39.864
we've said this before,
poor imagination and mortality

00:55:39.864 --> 00:55:42.639
are the two arguments for
discounting.

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:46.768
But let me tell a story that
seems to contradict that.

00:55:46.768 --> 00:55:50.065
Suppose someone asks you to
clean your room and they give

00:55:50.065 --> 00:55:53.480
you a choice of doing it--I can
give my son for example.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:57.061
Say I--"Clean your room
Constantin,"

00:55:57.061 --> 00:56:01.998
and so if I say do it today or
do it tomorrow that makes a huge

00:56:01.998 --> 00:56:05.250
difference to him,
I mean just a huge difference

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.159
doing it today from doing it
tomorrow.

00:56:07.159 --> 00:56:10.277
He'll think doing it today is
just impossible,

00:56:10.277 --> 00:56:14.780
doing it tomorrow I can almost
force him into agreeing to that.

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:18.572
So clearly there's a big
discount between today and

00:56:18.572 --> 00:56:23.429
tomorrow, but what about between
a year from now and a year and a

00:56:23.429 --> 00:56:24.719
day from now?
 

00:56:24.719 --> 00:56:27.847
Do you think Constantin will
think there's any difference in

00:56:27.847 --> 00:56:28.219
that?
 

00:56:28.219 --> 00:56:29.730
The answer is no.
 

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:33.329
If I say, "Constantine,
do you agree to clean it 365

00:56:33.329 --> 00:56:37.119
days from now or 366 days from
now," to him there's hardly

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:40.550
any difference,
but there's hardly any tradeoff.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.240
One is hardly more valuable
than the other,

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.617
of course, they're both pretty
unimportant, but the ratio of

00:56:44.617 --> 00:56:46.510
the two doesn't even seem
important to him.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.119
So that's called hyperbolic
discounting.

00:56:49.119 --> 00:56:58.920
If you do any experiment with
people or with animals,

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:03.632
you make a bird do something
and if he does more stuff he

00:57:03.632 --> 00:57:07.231
gets the things faster,
he'll do a lot of stuff to get

00:57:07.231 --> 00:57:09.630
it in the next minute as opposed
to in 2 minutes,

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:15.168
but the difference between what
he'll do in 10 minutes versus 11

00:57:15.168 --> 00:57:17.280
minutes is very small.
 

00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:30.192
So hyperbolic discounting is
discounting much less than

00:57:30.192 --> 00:57:36.409
exponential discounting.
 

00:57:36.409 --> 00:57:41.969
So this has a tremendous
importance for the environment.

00:57:41.969 --> 00:57:45.389
If you thought that people
exponentially discounted like

00:57:45.389 --> 00:57:48.250
they thought each year was only
95 percent--

00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:51.041
if the interest rate's 5
percent it sounds like the

00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:53.498
discounting is .95,
so if next year's only 95

00:57:53.498 --> 00:57:55.268
percent as important as this
year,

00:57:55.268 --> 00:57:58.686
and the year after that is only
95 percent as important as the

00:57:58.686 --> 00:58:00.800
first year,
and the third year is only 95

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:02.730
percent as important as the
second year,

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:07.300
.95 in 100 years to the
hundredth is an incredibly small

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:08.050
number.
 

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.349
So there's no point in doing
something today and investing a

00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:14.594
lot resources in order to clean
up the environment and help

00:58:14.594 --> 00:58:17.590
people 100 years from now,
because by discounting it this

00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:20.103
much nobody could,
you know, what's the difference

00:58:20.103 --> 00:58:22.099
because the future's so
unimportant.

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:24.469
You shouldn't be investing
resources now to do something

00:58:24.469 --> 00:58:26.579
that's going to have such a
small effect later.

00:58:26.579 --> 00:58:30.588
So in all the reports on the
environment a crucial half of

00:58:30.588 --> 00:58:34.809
the report is devoted to what
the discount rate should be.

00:58:34.809 --> 00:58:38.744
So, but they never thought of
doing the most obvious thing

00:58:38.744 --> 00:58:42.543
which is to ask what would
happen if the discounting was

00:58:42.543 --> 00:58:43.510
uncertain.
 

00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:45.719
All of these are certain
discount rates.

00:58:45.719 --> 00:58:49.056
So what if you made the
discounting uncertain what would

00:58:49.056 --> 00:58:50.268
you imagine doing?
 

00:58:50.268 --> 00:58:54.059
So suppose you discount today
at 100 percent,

00:58:54.059 --> 00:58:57.724
and maybe next period you're
going to discount at 200

00:58:57.724 --> 00:59:00.351
percent,
this is the interest rate,

00:59:00.351 --> 00:59:03.268
and here it might go down to 50
percent.

00:59:03.268 --> 00:59:08.990
It could go up to 400 percent
or it could go down to 100

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.231
percent again,
or it could go down to 25

00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:16.161
percent, you know,
this kind of discounting I have

00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:16.960
in mind.
 

00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:22.759
You don't know--so delta = 1
over (1 r), and this is r,

00:59:22.759 --> 00:59:25.873
r_0,
r_up,

00:59:25.873 --> 00:59:28.130
r_down.
 

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:32.489
So maybe the discount is
uncertain and it goes like that.

00:59:32.489 --> 00:59:35.300
So it's a geometric random walk.
 

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:37.670
I keep multiplying or dividing
by 2.

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.170
I multiply or divide by 2.
 

00:59:39.170 --> 00:59:40.929
I multiply or divide by 2.
 

00:59:40.929 --> 00:59:43.389
That seems to make for a lot of
discounting.

00:59:43.389 --> 00:59:45.239
These numbers are going up very
fast.

00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:49.000
The higher the r,
the less you care about the

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:49.768
future.
 

00:59:49.768 --> 00:59:53.922
So the question is if you ask
for a dollar sometime in the

00:59:53.922 --> 00:59:57.710
future, what will people be
willing to pay for it?

00:59:57.710 --> 01:00:02.949
So you know today that you
think the future is only half as

01:00:02.949 --> 01:00:05.389
important as the present.
 

01:00:05.389 --> 01:00:10.460
Let's say these all have
probability of half.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.230
And tomorrow it might be that
you think the future is only 2

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.235
thirds,
the next year's only 2 thirds

01:00:16.235 --> 01:00:17.929
as important as that current
year,

01:00:17.929 --> 01:00:22.217
or you might think the future's
only 1 third as important as

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:23.090
this year.
 

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:24.230
So you see how this is working?
 

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:27.427
Two years from now you might
think the future's only 1 fifth,

01:00:27.427 --> 01:00:30.840
the third year's only 1 fifth
as important as the second year.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.931
Here you might think the third
year is half as important as the

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:34.630
second year.
 

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:38.163
Here you might think it's 4
fifths as important as the third

01:00:38.163 --> 01:00:39.840
[correction: second]
year.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.059
So you don't know what it's
going to be,

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:45.418
and if anything this process
seems to give you a bias towards

01:00:45.418 --> 01:00:48.632
getting really high numbers,
high discounts,

01:00:48.632 --> 01:00:50.880
meaning the future doesn't
matter.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:56.530
So, but nobody bothered to
stop--so this is the most famous

01:00:56.530 --> 01:00:59.940
interest rate process in
finance.

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:04.202
This is called the Ho-Lee
interest rate model where you

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:08.070
think today's interest rate
might be 4 percent.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:10.722
Maybe it'll be 10 percent
higher next year or 10 percent

01:01:10.722 --> 01:01:13.230
lower and it'll keep going up
and down like that,

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:15.360
and that's the uncertainty
about the interest rate.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.070
So if we think interest rates
are so important,

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:19.940
and patience is so important,
and we want to add uncertainty,

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.090
the first place to do it is to
the interest rate,

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:24.539
and the Ho-Lee model in finance
does that.

01:01:24.539 --> 01:01:32.329
Nobody bothered to compute this
out more than 30 years.

01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:34.179
Compute what out?
 

01:01:34.179 --> 01:01:38.760
Suppose you get 1 dollar for
sure in year 1.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.239
How much would you pay for 1
dollar in year 1?

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:43.860
Well, your discount is 100
percent.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.369
You'd pay 1 half a dollar.
 

01:01:45.369 --> 01:01:49.518
How much would you pay for 1
dollar in year 2?

01:01:49.518 --> 01:01:54.659
Well, you know how much more a
dollar now is worth than 1 year

01:01:54.659 --> 01:01:57.291
from now,
but you don't know 2 years from

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:59.750
now so you have to work by
backward induction.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.219
Here 1 dollar for sure is worth
1 dollar.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:03.639
What would I pay for it here?
 

01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:07.059
I'd pay 1 third of a dollar.
 

01:02:07.059 --> 01:02:08.820
What would I pay for it here?
 

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.159
Well, the discount is 2 thirds.
 

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:12.320
I'd pay 2 thirds of a dollar.
 

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.070
So what would I pay for it back
here?

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:19.643
I'd pay 1 half times 1 third 1
half times 2 thirds discounted

01:02:19.643 --> 01:02:20.940
by 100 percent.
 

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:28.083
So that's 1 third 1 sixth which
is 1 half, times 1 half,

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:31.980
which is 1 quarter,
I guess.

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:33.360
So I'd pay 1 quarter.
 

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:40.469
So for any time I could figure
out D(t) = amount I would pay,

01:02:40.469 --> 01:02:41.820
I'm going to be done in one
minute,

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:55.539
amount I would pay today for 1
dollar for sure at time t.

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.965
And that number,
obviously, is going to go down

01:02:58.965 --> 01:03:02.092
as t goes up,
and we know how to compute it

01:03:02.092 --> 01:03:04.030
by backward induction.
 

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:06.431
You just put the 1s further and
further out and then you go

01:03:06.431 --> 01:03:07.840
backwards by backward induction.
 

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:10.878
But just like for the World
Series I could do that any T

01:03:10.878 --> 01:03:13.125
however big I want to,
and on a computer,

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:15.239
and the spreadsheet which I
wrote for you,

01:03:15.239 --> 01:03:17.329
you could do this instantly.
 

01:03:17.329 --> 01:03:20.496
And nobody bothered to do this
for T bigger than 30 because

01:03:20.496 --> 01:03:23.389
bonds basically don't last for
more than 30 years,

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:25.619
so what's the point in doing it
for T bigger than 30?

01:03:25.619 --> 01:03:27.601
So 100 years--there are
virtually no financial

01:03:27.601 --> 01:03:30.331
instruments that are 100 years
long because they didn't both to

01:03:30.331 --> 01:03:30.860
do this.
 

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:34.369
Suppose you did it for every T
up to 1,000 years?

01:03:34.369 --> 01:03:36.480
Well, you could do it on a
computer very easily.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.059
You could even prove a theorem
of what it's like.

01:03:39.059 --> 01:03:42.960
So in the problem set I'm going
to ask you do a few of these,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:48.860
and what you're going to find
is that people are hyperbolic--

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:51.440
that you get--you discount a
lot.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:53.849
It's pretty close to 100
percent for the first few

01:03:53.849 --> 01:03:56.594
periods,
but after that you're going to

01:03:56.594 --> 01:03:58.702
be--anyway,
you're going to find out what

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:00.969
the numbers turn out to be when
you do it on a computer.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:04.987
So we're going to start with
random interest rates next

01:04:04.987 --> 01:04:08.929
period, the most important
variable in the economy.

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:14.000

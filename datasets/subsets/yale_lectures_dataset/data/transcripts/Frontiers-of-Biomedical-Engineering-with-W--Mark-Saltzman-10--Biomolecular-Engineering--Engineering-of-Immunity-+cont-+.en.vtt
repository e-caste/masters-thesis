Professor Mark Saltzman:
Great, well welcome,

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.190
today we're going to continue
talking about vaccines.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.594
We started on this topic on
Tuesday, particularly

00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:24.425
emphasizing smallpox and kind of
the history of vaccine

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:27.156
development.
Then, also emphasizing in the

00:00:27.156 --> 00:00:29.688
case of smallpox,
how even after the scientific

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:31.800
discovery was made,
it took many,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.884
many decades for people to be
able to produce the vaccine in

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:39.000
large enough quantities and
distribute it,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.651
so that you could think about
making an impact on global

00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:46.920
prevalence of the disease.
We want to talk about that same

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.817
concept today in terms of polio,
which is a vaccine that is both

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:56.249
made and manufactured in a
different way than the smallpox

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.486
vaccine.
That will lead us into a

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.552
discussion of sort of modern
methods and sort of the spectrum

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:04.670
of methods that are available
now for vaccine development.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.389
The other thing that I want to
do today is try to tie this

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:10.251
discussion on vaccines a little
bit more closely with what we

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:14.028
talked about last week,
in terms of what happens inside

00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:18.685
your body when you receive a
vaccine or when you're exposed

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:22.424
to an antigen,
and how the immune system

00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:26.815
actually responds to that.
The question is 'what happens

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:29.709
after a vaccine is introduced
into the body?'

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.799
I want to spend some time on
that until we talk about--before

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.140
we talk about development of the
polio vaccine.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.610
Here, I've just picked a
couple of the pictures that I

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.715
showed you last time when we
were talking about cell

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:46.090
communication in the immune
system,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.177
What happens after the vaccine
is introduced into your body is

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:54.180
that it initiates cellular
events.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.300
Cells share signals with each
other, and that leads to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.731
activation of a specific cell
population if we're thinking

00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:06.230
about a vaccine that produces
antibodies,

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.075
for example,
that leads to activation of

00:02:09.075 --> 00:02:12.650
B-cells, immature B-cells,
which do two things.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.923
They both proliferate,
increase in number,

00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:19.355
and they differentiate;
they differentiate from

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:22.349
immature B-cells into antibody
producing cells.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.494
So, let me go back to what we
talked about last week and

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:28.009
illustrate that a little bit
more closely.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:31.979
One of the things that
happens is that certain cells

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.092
within your body process the
vaccine or the antigen and we

00:02:36.092 --> 00:02:40.297
talked about that.
We talked about host cells that

00:02:40.297 --> 00:02:45.280
are perhaps infected with a
virus, displaying pieces of that

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.469
virus,
antigenic pieces of that virus

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.600
in the context of a surface
receptor called MHC-1,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.309
presenting that.
Other cells in the immune

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:02.388
system recognizing that this is
a foreign molecule,

00:03:02.388 --> 00:03:08.280
but is being presented in the
context of a 'self' cell.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.544
Because it has MHC-1,
your MHC-1 on it,

00:03:11.544 --> 00:03:16.354
this T-cell recognizes that
it's one of your cells but it

00:03:16.354 --> 00:03:20.220
has a foreign antigen associated
with it.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.309
In this case,
it might be a piece of a virus

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.039
that's replicating inside this
cell.

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:30.400
So, that's antigen presentation
to this population of cells

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.430
called cytotoxic T-cells,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.597
T_c,
a subset of the class of

00:03:38.597 --> 00:03:43.367
T-cells in the immune system.
They become activated and they

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:47.202
produce, eventually,
mature cytotoxic T-cells in

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:51.210
large numbers.
These cells can now kill cells

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.713
that have the correct signature,
and the signature is MHC-1 with

00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:00.469
this foreign antigen associated
with it.

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.781
Now, for antibody
production it is still a T-cell

00:04:03.781 --> 00:04:06.710
that recognizes the antigen
presenting cell.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.285
But this antigen presenting
cell is more likely a

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.189
professional antigen presenting
cell,

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.949
or a subset of cells of your
immune system that are

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.611
specialized in ingesting foreign
particles and displaying their

00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:25.069
contents to the rest of the
immune system.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.048
So, the classes of T-cells:
macrophages,

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:31.637
natural killer cells,
these are a class of cells

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:35.990
that's particularly important
called dendritic cells.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:41.834
They might ingest extracellular
antigen, presented pieces of it

00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:46.360
on their cell surface in the
context of MHC-2.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.165
Another subset of T-cells
called T helper cells will

00:04:51.165 --> 00:04:55.594
recognize that signal by direct
contact with it,

00:04:55.594 --> 00:05:00.399
and they will become activated
and proliferate.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:03.818
Now, these T_h-cells,
helper T-cells,

00:05:03.818 --> 00:05:07.832
go on to stimulate B-cells,
and it's these B-cells that

00:05:07.832 --> 00:05:11.622
become the mature antibody
producing cells that make

00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:15.709
quantities of antibody that fill
up in your body.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:19.584
The antibody that they
stimulate is antibody that's

00:05:19.584 --> 00:05:23.769
specific to this antigen that
was presented earlier.

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:27.434
Now, I recognize--well you
should recognize that this is a

00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:31.218
very simplified view of a highly
complex network of interactions

00:05:31.218 --> 00:05:34.168
that takes place.
If you go on to study more

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:37.221
about immunology,
which I know most of you will,

00:05:37.221 --> 00:05:40.663
you will recognize that
I'm--this is just the simplest

00:05:40.663 --> 00:05:44.690
level of one of the most complex
systems within our body.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.893
It has to be complex,
because we're asking the immune

00:05:47.893 --> 00:05:51.774
system to be able to respond to
every potential foreign pathogen

00:05:51.774 --> 00:05:55.914
that we come into contact with.
It does that through a complex

00:05:55.914 --> 00:05:58.296
set of sort of cellular
interactions,

00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:02.133
and it turns out also gene
rearrangements if you go further

00:06:02.133 --> 00:06:05.197
to study that.
This is just a highly

00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:08.750
simplified view.
What I want you to remember is

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.374
that specific sub-populations of
cells get activated,

00:06:12.374 --> 00:06:15.790
the activation results in a
specific response.

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:20.762
In this case here,
you're generating host cells,

00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:25.099
cytotoxic T-cells,
that can kill only very

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:28.922
specific cells,
cells that are expressing this

00:06:28.922 --> 00:06:32.419
foreign antigen.
In the case of the helper cells

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:36.880
they stimulate a specific
population of B-cells to mature

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.677
into antibody producing cells,
and that antibody is generated

00:06:42.677 --> 00:06:46.899
against the antigen that
stimulated it.

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.986
If we just thought about
that second part of it,

00:06:50.986 --> 00:06:55.304
just the antibody generation,
or the humoral what we called

00:06:55.304 --> 00:06:58.529
last time--last week,
the humoral immune response,

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:02.625
the immune response associated
with generation of antibodies in

00:07:02.625 --> 00:07:06.860
the blood and in other fluids.
We looked at the kinetics of

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.267
this response,
what happens in your body after

00:07:10.267 --> 00:07:14.607
you're exposed to an antigen.
So, this is a time course here,

00:07:14.607 --> 00:07:18.518
this scale is in days.
So, this is several months and

00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:23.079
this logarithmic scale on the
Y-axis represents antibody

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:26.175
concentration.
Now, we're not thinking about

00:07:26.175 --> 00:07:29.545
total antibody concentration
because you already have a lot

00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:33.379
of antibodies circulating within
your blood and in your fluids.

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:38.348
We're thinking about the
particular antibody that binds

00:07:38.348 --> 00:07:42.120
to this antigen that you're
exposed to.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.177
I'm using, here,
antigen interchangeably with

00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:49.385
vaccine for our purposes today.
So, the antigen we're thinking

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:52.960
about is a vaccine particularly
designed to elicit immune

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.440
response against a pathogen.
You introduce that antigen

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.439
into a person,
into me for example.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.564
There's a lag period where if I
was just looking for antibodies

00:08:04.564 --> 00:08:07.778
nothing happens for a while.
At some point,

00:08:07.778 --> 00:08:11.608
maybe a week later,
four to eight days later,

00:08:11.608 --> 00:08:15.699
you would start to see antibody
levels rise.

00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:19.656
Again, these are antibodies
that are specific to that

00:08:19.656 --> 00:08:22.699
antigen or vaccine that we
introduced.

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:25.423
Those levels would reach a
plateau after some period of

00:08:25.423 --> 00:08:28.450
time, maybe after a couple of
weeks and then they would begin

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.750
to decline again.
Now, if I was a person that was

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:35.365
designing a vaccine and I
noticed that this was the

00:08:35.365 --> 00:08:38.750
response that it got,
that antibodies were produced,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.049
they reached some intermediate
level, they started to fall,

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:44.016
I would say,
'well I haven't stimulated the

00:08:44.016 --> 00:08:45.889
immune system enough,
let me re-boost,

00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:48.399
let me give another dose of
antigen.

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:52.504
' If you did that what
would happen is you would see

00:08:52.504 --> 00:08:56.460
antibody levels rise even more
sharply than before.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.839
The response to the second
exposure in antigen is different

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:03.974
in a couple of ways.
One is there's no lag period,

00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:06.820
notice that antibody levels
start rising right away after

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.840
the second exposure.
That rate of rise is steeper so

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.632
they--antibody levels go up more
rapidly and they reach a higher

00:09:16.632 --> 00:09:19.539
level.
Now, this is just a typical

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:21.950
response.
You could probably find some

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.879
antigens that don't follow
exactly this behavior,

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.350
but in general,
this is the kind of behavior

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.740
you would see on first exposure
to an antigen or vaccine,

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.474
called the primary exposure,
and on subsequent exposure to

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:38.879
an antigen or vaccine called the
boost.

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:42.109
If this was tetanus,
you got this tetanus vaccine

00:09:42.109 --> 00:09:45.243
when you were young;
you get a boost every five or

00:09:45.243 --> 00:09:48.720
ten years because your antibody
levels are starting to fall.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.708
Now, just--what this
diagram also shows you is that

00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:58.789
that response is specific to
that particular antigen.

00:09:58.789 --> 00:10:02.497
It's not just that your whole
immune system gets revved up and

00:10:02.497 --> 00:10:05.718
it's going to respond more
rapidly to any antigen it's

00:10:05.718 --> 00:10:08.970
exposed to.
If we did the experiment where

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.572
on this booster we included not
only the initial antigen but

00:10:13.572 --> 00:10:18.035
some unrelated antigen,
the response to the unrelated

00:10:18.035 --> 00:10:22.570
antigen called B here,
looks like a primary response.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.558
There's a lag phase,
there's a slow rise to an

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:30.451
intermediate level of antibody.
So, every time you're exposed

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:35.294
to a new vaccine or a new
antigen you go through this

00:10:35.294 --> 00:10:40.790
primary response before you have
the secondary response.

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.262
Does that make sense?
Kate did you have a

00:10:44.262 --> 00:10:47.621
question?Student: If
there were just--if you were

00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:50.697
trying to create a positive
reaction of antigens and it

00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:54.171
showed up naturally wouldn't it
create this reaction anyway in

00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:57.588
terms of your body would create
antibodies like the secondary

00:10:57.588 --> 00:11:00.435
response volume to
antibodies?Professor Mark

00:11:00.435 --> 00:11:03.457
Saltzman: So,
I'm not sure I understand the

00:11:03.457 --> 00:11:04.629
question.
The question is,

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:07.133
'if you're naturally exposed to
antigen wouldn't this happen

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.020
anyway?'
Yeah, so for example,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.945
you get exposed to--before
there was a vaccine your brother

00:11:12.945 --> 00:11:16.163
or sister had chickenpox,
and so you got exposed to

00:11:16.163 --> 00:11:18.970
chickenpox naturally through
your contact with them.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:21.933
You would have this initial
response, now that initial

00:11:21.933 --> 00:11:24.897
response might be too slow to
prevent you from getting

00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:27.190
chickenpox.Student:
Right,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.827
but if you just got the primary
exposure, wouldn't the secondary

00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:35.139
response automatically--not a
booster shot,

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:37.638
just the secondary response
[inaudible], because you were

00:11:37.638 --> 00:11:39.200
exposed
[inaudible]?Professor

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.598
Mark Saltzman: Yeah,
so you're asking,

00:11:41.598 --> 00:11:44.504
if for example,
why do you need a booster of

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:48.152
tetanus, because if I get
exposed to tetanus wouldn't I

00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:51.799
have this rapid response?
The answer is 'yes you would',

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:54.930
the question is 'would that
response, even though it's much

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.270
faster,
be fast enough to protect you

00:11:57.270 --> 00:12:00.500
from the initial exposure to
tetanus that you got?'

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.645
Probably it wouldn't,
you would probably get a little

00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:05.519
bit sick anyway,
but recover.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:10.566
That's a really good question,
and I'm talking in terms of

00:12:10.566 --> 00:12:14.549
generalities here but the
specifics matter.

00:12:14.549 --> 00:12:17.599
That's why every--development
of every specific vaccine turns

00:12:17.599 --> 00:12:20.700
out to be different because they
don't all follow exactly this

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.385
kind of time course.
Some, like the smallpox vaccine

00:12:24.385 --> 00:12:29.158
on one exposure generates a very
high response that lasts for

00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:32.340
many years so you don't need a
boost.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.913
Others generate a weaker
response that does require

00:12:35.913 --> 00:12:38.755
boosting.
So, there's no absolutes about

00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:42.935
this, this is a general response
where all the features can be

00:12:42.935 --> 00:12:45.540
different with different
pathogens.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.490
Did that answer your question?
Why the lag phase?

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:53.019
Why the lag phase at the
beginning?

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:55.876
Well, because it takes some
time for these cellular events

00:12:55.876 --> 00:12:57.730
that I mentioned earlier to
happen.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.772
The antigen has to be presented
to helper T-cells,

00:13:00.772 --> 00:13:04.498
those helper T-cells have to
stimulate a B-cell population to

00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:06.919
both proliferate and
differentiate.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:09.039
So, this is a picture I showed
you before.

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:13.871
You can imagine that even when
this immature B-cell gets the

00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:17.894
signal 'now is the time,
you need to turn on antibody

00:13:17.894 --> 00:13:22.088
production', that it takes some
time for it to both proliferate

00:13:22.088 --> 00:13:25.876
to make enough cells and for
those cells to mature to the

00:13:25.876 --> 00:13:29.799
point where they become what are
called plasma cells,

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:32.769
which are antibody producing
factories;

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:34.220
takes some time for that to
happen.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.100
Now, why is the time less
on second exposure?

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.701
Because on second exposure
there's another population of

00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:44.498
cells that I haven't mentioned
before that remain after the

00:13:44.498 --> 00:13:48.100
primary exposure and those are
called memory cells,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.107
they're down here.
So not all of the B-cells that

00:13:52.107 --> 00:13:55.787
are stimulated become plasma
cells or antibody secreting

00:13:55.787 --> 00:13:57.967
cells.
Some of them become what are

00:13:57.967 --> 00:14:01.093
called memory cells.
These are cells that recognize

00:14:01.093 --> 00:14:04.398
a particular antigen,
they're ready to differentiate

00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:07.070
into antibody.
They're ready to rapidly

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.602
differentiate into antibody
producing cells and they're

00:14:10.602 --> 00:14:13.350
waiting for that second signal
to come.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.655
So, these memory cells are a
way that your immune system

00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:22.352
keeps track of antigens that
it's been exposed to for even if

00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:27.206
maybe the plasma cells that were
producing antibody in response

00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:31.590
to the initial exposure have
died and disappeared.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:36.568
Memory cells are long lasting
cells that remember this

00:14:36.568 --> 00:14:42.110
exposure and can respond very
quickly on second exposure.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.355
We talked about antibodies,
we talked about them two weeks

00:14:46.355 --> 00:14:49.556
ago, we talked about them in
section last week,

00:14:49.556 --> 00:14:52.609
uses of them.
I just want to remind you that

00:14:52.609 --> 00:14:56.349
if you looked at the population
of antibodies inside--in your

00:14:56.349 --> 00:14:57.921
blood,
for example,

00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:02.049
the predominant antibodies
would look like this.

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:06.820
These are of the class called
IgG, they're Y shaped molecules.

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.754
They have a region down here
called the FC region,

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:14.690
and that is responsible for
effector functions.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.501
There's a region up here called
the antigen binding region and

00:15:18.501 --> 00:15:22.500
those--and there's two copies of
that region and it's responsible

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.667
for antigen binding.
So, many--the predominant

00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:29.202
number of antibodies in your
blood look like these IgG

00:15:29.202 --> 00:15:31.462
molecules.
But not all of them do,

00:15:31.462 --> 00:15:34.429
there are different kinds of
antibody molecules.

00:15:34.429 --> 00:15:39.511
Not only the IgG but there are
special antibodies called

00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:44.407
secretory IgA and these are
highly enriched in mucosal

00:15:44.407 --> 00:15:48.379
fluids in the mucus lining of
your gut,

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:51.283
and the eye,
and of other--of mucosal

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.870
organs.
They're also enriched in milk.

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.690
So, milk contains large
quantities of this special class

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.259
of antibodies called secretory
IgA.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:06.544
They also have binding sites
for antigen, but they are sort

00:16:06.544 --> 00:16:11.828
of two IgG type molecules bound
together by another peptide

00:16:11.828 --> 00:16:14.273
chain.
So, imagine taking two IgG's,

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:17.340
turning one upside-down and
then they're hooked together.

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.525
The advantage of this is that
now you have four binding sites

00:16:20.525 --> 00:16:24.394
for antigen instead of just two.
So, these are better at binding

00:16:24.394 --> 00:16:28.190
to antigen because they have
more binding sites on them.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:31.496
It also turns out that they're
made stable in these

00:16:31.496 --> 00:16:35.331
environments like milk and mucus
secretions because of this

00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:38.440
secretory chain which is wrapped
around it.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.860
Another important class of
antibodies is called IgM.

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.256
The IgM is really five IgG-type
molecules that are linked

00:16:48.256 --> 00:16:51.629
together through disulfide
bonds,

00:16:51.629 --> 00:16:55.741
such that their FC portions are
all pointing in and their

00:16:55.741 --> 00:16:59.340
antibody binding portions are
all pointing out.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.933
So, now you have a single
molecule, very large molecule,

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:06.920
with not just two binding sites
but with ten binding sites.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:11.539
This is a very potent molecule
for binding to antigen.

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:15.869
One of the things that I didn't
mention before is that when you

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:20.059
get this primary response and
then the secondary response,

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:23.622
if you looked at the antibodies
that are generated during the

00:17:23.622 --> 00:17:26.588
primary response,
again we're only looking at

00:17:26.588 --> 00:17:30.400
antibodies that bind to the
particular antigen or vaccine

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.920
that we have used for the
priming.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.362
If you looked at the antibodies
that were present in the blood,

00:17:36.362 --> 00:17:39.445
for example,
you would find that most of

00:17:39.445 --> 00:17:44.741
those antibodies are IgM during
this initial period of antibody

00:17:44.741 --> 00:17:48.624
concentration rise.
Most of them are of the class

00:17:48.624 --> 00:17:51.970
IgM;
IgM antibodies are produced on

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:55.426
first exposure.
If you looked later,

00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:58.752
as the antibody production
response matures,

00:17:58.752 --> 00:18:03.394
some IgG is produced so that in
the late period after initial

00:18:03.394 --> 00:18:08.190
priming you'd have a mixture of
IgM and IgG in the blood.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.436
On second exposure it's
different, that IgG is produced

00:18:12.436 --> 00:18:16.289
predominantly on second exposure
to an antigen.

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:19.812
One thing I do want you to
remember is that IgM class

00:18:19.812 --> 00:18:23.810
antibodies are the antibodies
produced on first exposure.

00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:26.546
Why?
Why do you think IgM are

00:18:26.546 --> 00:18:30.313
produced on first exposure?
Well, one way to think about is

00:18:30.313 --> 00:18:33.681
they have more antigen binding
sites and so they're going to be

00:18:33.681 --> 00:18:36.940
more efficient at neutralizing
the pathogen on a per-molecule

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.617
basis than IgG is.
So, it's good to get those

00:18:39.617 --> 00:18:42.088
produced more quickly.
The memory cells,

00:18:42.088 --> 00:18:45.499
which are stimulated,
lead to an IgG response and

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:49.052
that's why IgG is the antibody
of--that is produced

00:18:49.052 --> 00:18:55.556
predominantly after the boost,
but there is some IgM produced

00:18:55.556 --> 00:18:58.496
also.
Let's talk about the polio

00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:01.700
virus vaccine,
keeping those things in mind.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.660
Polio was--is a crippling
disease.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.856
In many cases,
it affects--it also initiates

00:19:09.856 --> 00:19:15.179
its infection through the gut.
It can be passed from one

00:19:15.179 --> 00:19:20.017
person to another orally and
infects first cells of your

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:24.680
intestinal system and then
spreads to other cells,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.356
in particular,
spreads to cells that are

00:19:27.356 --> 00:19:31.335
involved in the neuro muscular
junction and can affect then

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:35.589
muscle activity or your ability
to move voluntary muscles.

00:19:35.589 --> 00:19:40.244
So, polio--the disease caused
by polio can be a paralytic

00:19:40.244 --> 00:19:44.890
disease, crippling,
and in some cases can lead to

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.789
death if the disease progresses
in certain ways.

00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:53.654
If we looked in 1950,
this is the incidence of

00:19:53.654 --> 00:19:58.860
paralytic, or the worst form of
poliomyelitis in the U.S.

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:04.101
was about 20 per 100,000 people.
This is mostly a disease that

00:20:04.101 --> 00:20:08.024
would occur in children.
You would first get exposed in

00:20:08.024 --> 00:20:12.165
children--in childhood and then
at a point when you're

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:16.885
susceptible to the disease.
So in a town that's the size of

00:20:16.885 --> 00:20:20.410
New Haven with a population of
let's say 100,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.340
000 people in just the
immediate New Haven area,

00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:29.191
there might be 20 of these
instances of very severe form of

00:20:29.191 --> 00:20:33.471
polio per year,
20 crippled children would

00:20:33.471 --> 00:20:36.056
result.
So, over the course of time

00:20:36.056 --> 00:20:39.114
this could have a very
substantial impact on the

00:20:39.114 --> 00:20:42.230
community.
Because it's passed by--can be

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.847
passed by an oral route it's a
disease that's very effectively

00:20:46.847 --> 00:20:51.540
transmitted in school settings
where children are together,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.632
or childcare settings.
So, it was something that

00:20:55.632 --> 00:20:58.740
parents before 1950 were very
concerned about.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.466
If a case of polio emerged in
the community,

00:21:01.466 --> 00:21:04.954
the chances that it could
spread to other children or to

00:21:04.954 --> 00:21:08.541
your child were high;
so, great interest in this in

00:21:08.541 --> 00:21:12.871
the early part of this century.
A group of scientists,

00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.726
mainly in Boston found,
importantly,

00:21:15.726 --> 00:21:20.703
that they could cultivate the
polio virus, the disease causing

00:21:20.703 --> 00:21:23.996
polio virus;
they could cultivate it in cell

00:21:23.996 --> 00:21:26.791
culture.
They found that certain cells,

00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:29.930
in particular,
epithelial cells from monkey

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.190
kidneys, were very effective at
propagating the virus.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.319
So, you would grow these monkey
kidney cells in culture,

00:21:37.319 --> 00:21:40.049
you would add some virus to the
culture broth,

00:21:40.049 --> 00:21:42.809
the cells would become
infected, the virus would go

00:21:42.809 --> 00:21:46.152
through its life cycle.
The cells would be basically

00:21:46.152 --> 00:21:50.427
little reactors for generating
lots of virus so you could make

00:21:50.427 --> 00:21:54.918
lots of virus to study.
Jonas Salk, who probably you've

00:21:54.918 --> 00:21:57.930
heard the name,
was a physician who,

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.640
at the time thought,
'well if we can make large

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:05.501
quantities of this virus then
perhaps we can make it into a

00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:08.168
vaccine.'
But unlike the Cowpox

00:22:08.168 --> 00:22:11.980
virus, vaccinea, that we
talked about before,

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.119
this is the real disease
causing agent.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:18.018
If you just introduced this
polio virus, which you could

00:22:18.018 --> 00:22:21.233
make in large quantities into
people now, you would be causing

00:22:21.233 --> 00:22:23.767
polio.
So, you couldn't introduce the

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:27.647
live virus in because that would
cause the disease not just

00:22:27.647 --> 00:22:31.213
immunity.
Remember that the lucky thing

00:22:31.213 --> 00:22:36.549
about the smallpox vaccine was
that a naturally occurring

00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:42.076
attenuated form of the smallpox
virus variola called

00:22:42.076 --> 00:22:47.009
vaccinea was found.
So, that was a naturally

00:22:47.009 --> 00:22:52.207
occurring attenuated virus that
could be produced into a vaccine

00:22:52.207 --> 00:22:57.224
that didn't cause the disease.
The strategy that Salk used

00:22:57.224 --> 00:23:01.597
was to kill the virus instead.
Make a lot of the virus,

00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:05.232
it has all of its antigenic
epitopes on it,

00:23:05.232 --> 00:23:09.819
but we'll just kill it so that
it can't replicate.

00:23:09.819 --> 00:23:12.812
Then, if we inject it into
people they'll be getting the

00:23:12.812 --> 00:23:15.107
real virus.
Hopefully their immune systems

00:23:15.107 --> 00:23:18.494
will respond to it like the real
virus but it won't be capable of

00:23:18.494 --> 00:23:21.511
replication because we've
chemically cross linked it so it

00:23:21.511 --> 00:23:25.424
can't go through its life cycle.
I'll talk about viral life

00:23:25.424 --> 00:23:29.859
cycles in a moment and you'll
see how that killing worked.

00:23:29.859 --> 00:23:31.874
They grew the virus in monkey
cell cultures,

00:23:31.874 --> 00:23:34.639
they purified the virus because
you got to get all the other

00:23:34.639 --> 00:23:37.309
stuff from the cells that you're
growing it in a way,

00:23:37.309 --> 00:23:41.611
they inactivated it by treating
it with formalin which is just a

00:23:41.611 --> 00:23:44.819
formula--it's just a mixture of
Formaldehyde;

00:23:44.819 --> 00:23:46.490
Formaldehyde cross links
proteins.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.743
So, you cross link all the
proteins in the virus,

00:23:49.743 --> 00:23:53.741
and you make a particle that
looks like a virus but it can't

00:23:53.741 --> 00:23:57.740
act like a virus any longer
because it can't replicate.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:00.117
Then, they did preliminary
studies of safety and

00:24:00.117 --> 00:24:03.052
effectiveness in people.
Basically, injecting it into

00:24:03.052 --> 00:24:05.944
some test subjects,
making sure that they didn't

00:24:05.944 --> 00:24:09.820
get diseased from it and looking
at antibody responses to see if

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.439
it worked and it did.
So, very rapidly a clinical

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:15.980
trial was started.
Now, the problem,

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.868
or one of the challenges with
clinical trials of vaccines is

00:24:19.868 --> 00:24:23.887
that you have to enroll a lot of
patients into clinical trials

00:24:23.887 --> 00:24:27.710
because only a few are going to
get sick in any case,

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:31.681
only 20 out of 100,000.
So, you're treating healthy

00:24:31.681 --> 00:24:34.105
people and you're trying to
prevent them from getting a

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:36.440
disease and you don't know who's
going to get it.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.692
You have to test it by giving
the vaccine to a large

00:24:39.692 --> 00:24:43.008
population of people,
and then watching and seeing if

00:24:43.008 --> 00:24:46.069
you've reduced the incidence of
the disease.

00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:49.331
It's--that's a very different
process than testing a drug,

00:24:49.331 --> 00:24:51.849
where if you had a drug for
heart disease,

00:24:51.849 --> 00:24:53.981
for example,
you would give it to patients

00:24:53.981 --> 00:24:56.789
that had heart disease and see
if you had an impact.

00:24:56.789 --> 00:25:00.200
You could do that with a
relatively small number.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.909
If you're trying to prevent a
disease that only occurs at a

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:05.891
rate of 20 per 100,
000 people you have to give the

00:25:05.891 --> 00:25:09.830
vaccine to millions in order to
see if the number goes down.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.827
Does that make sense?
They started the clinical

00:25:12.827 --> 00:25:15.176
trial.
The clinical trial was designed

00:25:15.176 --> 00:25:18.863
such that almost two million
elementary school children were

00:25:18.863 --> 00:25:22.953
given this test vaccine.
You could imagine that this is

00:25:22.953 --> 00:25:28.079
a monumental sort of undertaking
in a number of different ways.

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:31.246
One is if you have to
coordinate how you're going to

00:25:31.246 --> 00:25:34.910
give this vaccine to two million
children across the U.S.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:37.743
You want to give it to people
in different communities,

00:25:37.743 --> 00:25:40.943
to make sure that it works in
all the subpopulations where the

00:25:40.943 --> 00:25:44.229
vaccine's potentially valuable.
You want to give it to children

00:25:44.229 --> 00:25:46.988
because it's children that are
susceptible, and that's where

00:25:46.988 --> 00:25:49.700
you would like the vaccine to be
useful is in children.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.521
So, you want to give it to them
because the biology of children

00:25:52.521 --> 00:25:55.070
is different than adults,
and so you need to make sure it

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:58.117
works in that population.
They had to give some of them

00:25:58.117 --> 00:26:01.632
the real vaccine and some of
them a placebo vaccine in order

00:26:01.632 --> 00:26:04.789
that they could really tell if
the vaccine worked;

00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:07.240
you have to have it placebo
controlled.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.884
They did this in 1,800
elementary school children,

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:11.730
so these are about eight
year-olds.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:16.224
So, imagine proposing a
clinical trial like that today

00:26:16.224 --> 00:26:21.057
where you had a test vaccine
that had been tested in a few

00:26:21.057 --> 00:26:23.969
patients,
was thought to be safe,

00:26:23.969 --> 00:26:28.769
but we're going to give it to a
million--the test vaccine to a

00:26:28.769 --> 00:26:32.940
million or two million eight
year-olds in the U.S.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.494
and see if it works.
Well, you know that was

00:26:35.494 --> 00:26:37.730
possible at this time for a
couple of reasons.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.803
One is people must have had an
incredible amount of confidence

00:26:40.803 --> 00:26:44.053
in Jonas Salk.
He did a good job in preparing

00:26:44.053 --> 00:26:47.799
the initial studies to show that
it was safe.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:52.847
Two is it gives you some sense
for how concerned parents were

00:26:52.847 --> 00:26:57.727
about the risks of polio in the
community and how much they

00:26:57.727 --> 00:27:00.839
wanted a vaccine to be
developed,

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:03.774
such that they gave permission
for their children to enter into

00:27:03.774 --> 00:27:06.136
this trial.
Well, the vaccine turned

00:27:06.136 --> 00:27:09.623
out to be about 70% effective.
As we'll see in section today,

00:27:09.623 --> 00:27:12.523
a vaccine does not have to be
totally perfect in order to

00:27:12.523 --> 00:27:14.440
prevent transmission of a
disease,

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:17.672
because when a disease enters a
community its spread from one

00:27:17.672 --> 00:27:20.356
person to another.
If you can block one of those

00:27:20.356 --> 00:27:23.846
people from getting the vaccine,
you also stop--from getting the

00:27:23.846 --> 00:27:26.726
disease--you also stop all the
people they would have

00:27:26.726 --> 00:27:29.329
transmitted it too from getting
a disease.

00:27:29.329 --> 00:27:33.305
One can stop spread of disease
through a community without

00:27:33.305 --> 00:27:37.420
being 100% effective in each
person who gets the vaccine.

00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:40.907
That's an important concept.
So, it was effective,

00:27:40.907 --> 00:27:44.309
it was rapidly then introduced
into general use.

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:49.072
I taught at Cornell before
Yale, and my assistant was a

00:27:49.072 --> 00:27:53.166
woman named Bonnie at Cornell.
She was part of the clinical

00:27:53.166 --> 00:27:55.419
trial that did this,
and they gave everybody

00:27:55.419 --> 00:27:58.086
certificates after it was done.
So, you didn't know at the

00:27:58.086 --> 00:27:59.859
beginning, you knew you were
enrolled in the trial,

00:27:59.859 --> 00:28:02.871
they gave you a shot,
you didn't know whether you

00:28:02.871 --> 00:28:06.573
were part of the real group that
got the test vaccine or the

00:28:06.573 --> 00:28:09.019
placebo group that got the
control;

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:12.170
turned out that Bonnie was part
of the control group.

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.164
So she got a certificate at the
end thanking her for

00:28:14.164 --> 00:28:15.650
participating in the clinical
trial,

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.698
and also telling her to go get
the real vaccine because she

00:28:18.698 --> 00:28:22.933
hadn't had it yet.
So, this is real people who

00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:28.345
were involved in these tests.
Well, this shows what happened

00:28:28.345 --> 00:28:32.284
in the period after this vaccine
was introduced into the general

00:28:32.284 --> 00:28:35.160
population so that would have
been in 1954.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.480
This is a complex slide,
so let me show you what it is.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.868
The Salk Vaccine is also called
the Killed Polio Vaccine,

00:28:42.868 --> 00:28:46.772
and some people call it KPV,
also sometimes called

00:28:46.772 --> 00:28:50.911
Inactivated Polio Vaccine,
IPV, but this is the vaccine I

00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:53.720
just talked about produced by
Salk.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:56.816
After the clinical trial it was
rapidly introduced into the

00:28:56.816 --> 00:28:59.384
population.
This curve here with the square

00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:03.011
shows you how many millions of
vaccine doses were distributed

00:29:03.011 --> 00:29:06.944
across the U.S.,
so this is hundreds of millions

00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:11.443
of doses that were given.
As those doses were given you

00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:15.769
look at the prevalence of polio
within the United States.

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:20.704
It dropped dramatically in the
period from 1954--this is these

00:29:20.704 --> 00:29:23.859
filled black bars refer to this
axis,

00:29:23.859 --> 00:29:30.410
polio cases per 100,000
population dropped down to only

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:35.770
three or four cases by 1956.
So, this just shows as the

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:38.749
vaccine was distributed,
given to more people,

00:29:38.749 --> 00:29:42.390
that prevalence of the disease
dropped dramatically.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:45.135
Well, it also illustrates
that one of the things you do

00:29:45.135 --> 00:29:47.816
after you introduce a vaccine,
you can't stop there,

00:29:47.816 --> 00:29:50.873
you have to continually watch
what's happening with this

00:29:50.873 --> 00:29:54.289
disease in your population.
One thing that happened was

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:57.529
that after 1956,1957 the number
of cases were down,

00:29:57.529 --> 00:30:00.769
there was a small bump here,
the cases were up.

00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:03.704
This was of great concern
because the number of polio

00:30:03.704 --> 00:30:06.750
cases shouldn't go up as the
vaccine is being even more

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:09.290
actively distributed through the
country,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:12.567
so what happened?
This led people to go back and

00:30:12.567 --> 00:30:16.444
look at the places that were
manufacturing the vaccine to

00:30:16.444 --> 00:30:20.529
make sure that they were all
producing vaccine of the proper

00:30:20.529 --> 00:30:22.646
quality.
It turned out that one

00:30:22.646 --> 00:30:24.968
of--there were three vaccine
manufacturers,

00:30:24.968 --> 00:30:28.230
one of them was using the
procedure not quite correctly,

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:32.139
they weren't completely killing
the virus when they produced

00:30:32.139 --> 00:30:35.263
their vaccine.
So, some of these cases were

00:30:35.263 --> 00:30:39.463
probably due to polio that was
transmitted by incompletely

00:30:39.463 --> 00:30:43.000
killed virus that was present in
the vaccine.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.930
They fixed that procedure and
after that the cases went down

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:53.456
even more.
Now, the polio vaccine that

00:30:53.456 --> 00:30:56.871
Salk produced was very
effective, but it required a

00:30:56.871 --> 00:31:01.104
fairly large dose of the vaccine
and it had to be injected into

00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:04.723
the arms of children.
So, there was some thought that

00:31:04.723 --> 00:31:07.133
maybe we could do better.
Particularly,

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:11.050
if we took advantage of the
fact that this is a virus that's

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.900
easily transmitted orally and
could you make a vaccine that

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.490
would be effective orally as
well,

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:20.652
that would be a tremendous
advantage, especially in

00:31:20.652 --> 00:31:23.119
children who don't like to get
shots.

00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:26.317
If you could take your five
year-old or eight year-old in to

00:31:26.317 --> 00:31:29.514
get a vaccine that was orally
administered instead of a shot

00:31:29.514 --> 00:31:31.519
that's a much easier thing to
do.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:34.220
Plus it makes it,
as I talked about last time,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.640
much easier to think about
distributing the vaccine around

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.359
the world because shots require
skilled medical personnel,

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:46.700
whereas, an oral vaccine could
be self-administered.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.857
That means that it's easier to
take into certain kinds of

00:31:50.857 --> 00:31:54.049
populations or remote parts of
the world.

00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:57.710
An oral polio vaccine was
developed by a man named Sabin.

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:02.966
What he did was took the polio
virus into the laboratory and

00:32:02.966 --> 00:32:06.619
tried to make an attenuated form
of it,

00:32:06.619 --> 00:32:09.842
that is, 'can I get the virus
to mutate in ways that it

00:32:09.842 --> 00:32:13.362
doesn't change its physical
structure much so it still looks

00:32:13.362 --> 00:32:17.420
like active polio but it changes
its disease causing properties,

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:22.444
so it changes disease causing
properties without making it

00:32:22.444 --> 00:32:26.111
non-immunogenic?'
He produced an oral polio

00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:28.819
vaccine from an attenuated
virus.

00:32:28.819 --> 00:32:31.797
This was not a naturally
occurring attenuated virus as

00:32:31.797 --> 00:32:34.494
used in smallpox,
but a virus that was attenuated

00:32:34.494 --> 00:32:37.924
in the laboratory,
basically by propagating it in

00:32:37.924 --> 00:32:41.874
culture and looking for mutants
that were formed as you

00:32:41.874 --> 00:32:45.459
propagated this virus under
different experimental

00:32:45.459 --> 00:32:49.390
conditions.
This is the vaccine that you

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.281
probably took;
the vaccine that's still most

00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:55.559
widely used in the U.S.
is the oral form of the vaccine.

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:57.740
It's used because of the
reasons I described.

00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.150
Why would you maybe not want to
use the oral vaccine?

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.520
What are the disadvantages of
using it?

00:33:06.869 --> 00:33:10.021
Knowing what you know now,
any concerns about taking the

00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:12.830
oral polio vaccine instead of
getting the shot?

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:22.759
Are there any features that
you'd worry about?

00:33:22.759 --> 00:33:24.743
Bobby?Student: The
virus is not killed so

00:33:24.743 --> 00:33:27.349
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: It's a live virus,

00:33:27.349 --> 00:33:30.673
which is actually going to
infect your intestinal system

00:33:30.673 --> 00:33:33.431
and reproduce.
Because it infects your cells

00:33:33.431 --> 00:33:36.027
and reproduces,
your immune system responds

00:33:36.027 --> 00:33:39.016
much more vigorously.
You could imagine that you've

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:41.509
got virus that's propagating
inside your cells,

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:44.062
making more and more virus,
your immune system really

00:33:44.062 --> 00:33:46.951
responds well to that.
Doesn't respond as well to

00:33:46.951 --> 00:33:50.044
killed vaccines,
and that's why the Salk vaccine

00:33:50.044 --> 00:33:52.480
has to be injected at a high
dose.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:56.634
So, it's more effective because
it's a live virus but it's a

00:33:56.634 --> 00:34:00.436
little bit more concerning
because it's a live virus as

00:34:00.436 --> 00:34:02.973
well,
in that you trust that it's

00:34:02.973 --> 00:34:07.134
attenuated but could it convert
back to a virulent form or a

00:34:07.134 --> 00:34:10.763
form that caused a disease.
Turns out that that hasn't been

00:34:10.763 --> 00:34:13.542
a problem.
In fact, another advantage of

00:34:13.542 --> 00:34:17.409
the oral vaccine is that you
give it to children.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.339
They take it,
the vaccine itself,

00:34:19.339 --> 00:34:23.078
the virus, reproduces in their
gut and they can actually spread

00:34:23.078 --> 00:34:26.937
it to other children in the same
way that they spread the disease

00:34:26.937 --> 00:34:30.254
where you've got children that
are maybe at school or at

00:34:30.254 --> 00:34:32.553
childcare.
Have you ever looked at

00:34:32.553 --> 00:34:35.963
children in the playground?
They're all over each other

00:34:35.963 --> 00:34:39.829
sometimes and they can spread
saliva or other fluids.

00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:45.121
It turns out that if you give
one child in a home the oral

00:34:45.121 --> 00:34:49.855
vaccine, you often have a
protective effect in other

00:34:49.855 --> 00:34:54.960
children in the home as well
because it spreads from one

00:34:54.960 --> 00:35:00.550
individual to another.
That's another advantage of the

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:03.838
oral polio vaccine.
Well, polio is not yet

00:35:03.838 --> 00:35:07.235
eradicated but there still are
hopes that polio could be

00:35:07.235 --> 00:35:09.201
eradicated.
It's only endemic,

00:35:09.201 --> 00:35:12.750
that means only naturally
occurring in certain countries.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.305
The World Health Organization
keeps track of what countries

00:35:16.305 --> 00:35:18.880
have cases of polio and when
they occur,

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.201
and what the frequency of--So,
this is a map from a few years

00:35:22.201 --> 00:35:25.079
ago and there are efforts that
occur occasionally.

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:27.887
For example,
this effort that's described

00:35:27.887 --> 00:35:32.380
here from 2001 where the World
Health Organization has a push,

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.070
they say, 'we know where the
cases are occurring,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.210
we know what communities still
have polio within them,

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:42.530
if we do sort of really gear up
for a massive immunization

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.698
effort in those areas we could
eliminate polio from that

00:35:46.698 --> 00:35:48.486
community.
In this way,

00:35:48.486 --> 00:35:51.816
by knowing what communities
it's in and acting on all of

00:35:51.816 --> 00:35:55.449
them at once you might be able
to eradicate polio in the same

00:35:55.449 --> 00:35:57.750
way that we eradicated
smallpox.'

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.989
So far those efforts have
failed for a variety of reasons.

00:36:00.989 --> 00:36:03.690
One is the resources that are
needed in order to do this.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.640
The other is that some places
where the disease occurs the

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:11.188
governments are not stable,
or there might be civil unrest

00:36:11.188 --> 00:36:14.265
or civil wars and that makes it
very difficult to orchestrate

00:36:14.265 --> 00:36:17.188
giving vaccines when there's
other things happening in the

00:36:17.188 --> 00:36:19.650
country that are of more
immediate concern.

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:24.241
And there are some communities
that are frankly suspicious of

00:36:24.241 --> 00:36:28.756
Western medicine and don't want
people to come in with their

00:36:28.756 --> 00:36:32.735
modern approaches and feed
things to members of their

00:36:32.735 --> 00:36:35.565
community.
So, there is still problems to

00:36:35.565 --> 00:36:39.007
solve in doing this.
I wanted to show you,

00:36:39.007 --> 00:36:45.960
so that if you're interested in
this, and you want to keep track

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:53.023
there is a website called Global
Polio Eradication Initiative and

00:36:53.023 --> 00:36:56.408
you can look,
and you can actually look and

00:36:56.408 --> 00:36:59.349
see what countries polio is
occurring in and where they are,

00:36:59.349 --> 00:37:02.519
and how many cases have been
reported.

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:06.126
You can't see this too well but
there's a map of the world here

00:37:06.126 --> 00:37:09.675
that actually shows you all the
individual cases of polio that

00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:12.699
occurred between this period of
August 2007 and,

00:37:12.699 --> 00:37:15.909
it's cut off on the screen,
February of 2008.

00:37:15.909 --> 00:37:19.687
This is the kind of
surveillance that's needed to

00:37:19.687 --> 00:37:24.330
really make an impact and this
is why--one of the other ways

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:29.367
where engineering approaches are
needed in order to solve medical

00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:32.854
problems like this one.
There's a lot of engineering

00:37:32.854 --> 00:37:35.565
that we've already talked about
in terms of producing quantities

00:37:35.565 --> 00:37:38.485
of the vaccine,
producing it reliably,

00:37:38.485 --> 00:37:41.800
producing it safe,
distributing it,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:47.261
and keeping track requires a
level of sophistication that

00:37:47.261 --> 00:37:52.429
maybe you wouldn't have thought
about initially.

00:37:52.429 --> 00:37:57.428
That slide is on your--is in
the slides that are distributed

00:37:57.428 --> 00:38:02.257
if you want to follow on that
website, there's the picture

00:38:02.257 --> 00:38:07.787
that I copied yesterday.
You see most of the cases are

00:38:07.787 --> 00:38:13.014
in Central Africa and in the
region around India,

00:38:13.014 --> 00:38:17.822
particularly Northern India.
Let me go back and finish

00:38:17.822 --> 00:38:20.389
up today by talking about the
lifecycle of a virus.

00:38:20.389 --> 00:38:24.696
Again, this is a highly
simplified version of the

00:38:24.696 --> 00:38:28.699
lifecycle of a virus.
This might be a polio virus,

00:38:28.699 --> 00:38:31.403
for example.
The example I've given here is

00:38:31.403 --> 00:38:34.469
a virus that contains DNA as its
genetic material.

00:38:34.469 --> 00:38:38.314
You know that some viruses use
RNA as their genetic material

00:38:38.314 --> 00:38:42.223
and so their lifecycle is going
to be slightly different than

00:38:42.223 --> 00:38:44.775
this.
HIV is a member of the family

00:38:44.775 --> 00:38:48.977
of viruses called retroviruses,
and retroviruses all use RNA as

00:38:48.977 --> 00:38:52.051
their genetic material.
I'll talk about that at the end

00:38:52.051 --> 00:38:54.413
of the lecture here.
Here's a DNA virus,

00:38:54.413 --> 00:38:57.889
it infects a cell.
Usually viruses have certain

00:38:57.889 --> 00:39:02.488
kinds of cells they want to
infect or that they're capable

00:39:02.488 --> 00:39:05.804
of infecting.
That infection occurs because

00:39:05.804 --> 00:39:10.061
of a ligand receptor interaction
on the cell surface where the

00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:14.388
virus itself is the ligand and
it takes advantage of a receptor

00:39:14.388 --> 00:39:17.320
that's expressed on the cell
surface.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:21.080
For example,
HIV enters cells of the immune

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:25.110
system by binding to a receptor
called CD4.

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:32.653
These tropisms,
or affinities of viruses for

00:39:32.653 --> 00:39:35.449
certain cells,
are well mapped out now.

00:39:35.449 --> 00:39:38.869
The virus enters the cell and
it breaks down.

00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:41.619
It breaks down into its
component parts and I show two

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:45.346
of those component parts here,
one is the genetic material,

00:39:45.346 --> 00:39:48.373
in this case DNA,
and the other is all the

00:39:48.373 --> 00:39:51.989
proteins that form the structure
of the virus.

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:57.205
That DNA gets replicated to
make many more copies of the

00:39:57.205 --> 00:40:02.146
viral DNA using host mechanisms,
that is, often using the DNA

00:40:02.146 --> 00:40:05.885
polymerase which is naturally
present in the host cell for its

00:40:05.885 --> 00:40:09.154
own replication.
The proteins that are produced

00:40:09.154 --> 00:40:13.084
by genes that are on the viral
genome get transcribed and

00:40:13.084 --> 00:40:17.293
translated in order to make more
structural proteins that are

00:40:17.293 --> 00:40:19.960
needed for assembly of the
virus.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.717
The virus then can
self-assemble,

00:40:22.717 --> 00:40:26.469
that is, you've made a lot of
genetic material,

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:28.620
you've made a lot of the
structural pieces,

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.539
there has to be some way that
the virus can reassemble,

00:40:31.539 --> 00:40:36.539
repackage itself into active
forms.

00:40:36.539 --> 00:40:40.250
Then that--those active forms
are released from the cell.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.757
Now, sometimes those--that
release occurs without the cell

00:40:43.757 --> 00:40:46.083
itself dying.
In other cases,

00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:51.324
the virus propagates in such
high numbers that release is

00:40:51.324 --> 00:40:54.880
literally an explosion of the
cell.

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:58.119
Release of tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of new

00:40:58.119 --> 00:41:01.132
virus particles from one
individual cell such that the

00:41:01.132 --> 00:41:04.599
cell gets killed in the process
of replicating the virus.

00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:08.420
These released particles can
now go on and infect neighboring

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.304
cells, they can travel in the
bloodstream to infect cells at a

00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:16.570
distance and the virus spreads
throughout a multicellular host.

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.670
Now, what happened with the
Salk vaccine is that

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.903
Formaldehyde was used.
Formaldehyde cross-links

00:41:22.903 --> 00:41:26.080
proteins, so,
if you treated this virus with

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:29.036
Formaldehyde,
even it was able to enter a

00:41:29.036 --> 00:41:32.139
cell, it couldn't break down
anymore.

00:41:32.139 --> 00:41:36.490
So, its genetic material
wouldn't be released and even if

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:39.909
it was released,
the genetic material is also

00:41:39.909 --> 00:41:43.894
cross-linked,
and so it can't be transcribed

00:41:43.894 --> 00:41:48.837
and translated or replicated.
So, this is the stage at which

00:41:48.837 --> 00:41:51.949
you prevent disease in the Salk
vaccine.

00:41:51.949 --> 00:41:56.469
In the Sabin vaccine,
or the oral polio vaccine,

00:41:56.469 --> 00:41:59.659
now you have a non-virulent
virus.

00:41:59.659 --> 00:42:03.211
So, one that perhaps does not
reproduce in such high numbers

00:42:03.211 --> 00:42:05.860
that you create an overwhelming
infection,

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:12.291
but one that still goes through
its lifecycle but is limited in

00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:14.389
its effect.
That suggests,

00:42:14.389 --> 00:42:17.064
now, if you think about this
even highly simplified

00:42:17.064 --> 00:42:19.451
lifecycle,
suggests some other ways that

00:42:19.451 --> 00:42:22.659
we might use kind of modern
technologies to engineer new

00:42:22.659 --> 00:42:24.931
vaccines.
We've talked about getting

00:42:24.931 --> 00:42:28.013
lucky, finding a naturally
occurring attenuated live

00:42:28.013 --> 00:42:30.309
vaccine as in the case of
smallpox.

00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:33.804
We've talked about killing a
virus by cross-linking it,

00:42:33.804 --> 00:42:36.522
for example,
to make a substance that looks

00:42:36.522 --> 00:42:40.340
like a vaccine--looks like a
virus but can't replicate.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.301
We talked about attenuating in
the laboratory,

00:42:43.301 --> 00:42:47.250
using cell culture techniques
and what we know about mutating

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.882
viruses.
One can also purify parts

00:42:49.882 --> 00:42:52.614
of the protein,
that is, parts of the virus,

00:42:52.614 --> 00:42:56.300
that is, 'do I really need to
deliver the whole virus?'

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:59.984
If the immune system recognizes
only small pieces of the virus

00:42:59.984 --> 00:43:02.400
and mounts an immune response to
that,

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:06.996
how about if I just take these
pieces of a virus like some

00:43:06.996 --> 00:43:10.683
structural subunit,
some piece of protein and use

00:43:10.683 --> 00:43:13.356
that as a vaccine?
Now, I'm not introducing any

00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:16.090
genetic material at all so I
don't have to worry about it

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.579
replicating because there's no
genetic material,

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:23.119
all I do is deliver the
particles.

00:43:23.119 --> 00:43:26.413
Well, this is an approach
that's been used in a variety of

00:43:26.413 --> 00:43:29.130
vaccines, most successfully with
Hepatitis B,

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.090
so the problem is where do you
get these proteins?

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:35.641
Well, one way to get proteins,
and it was first used in

00:43:35.641 --> 00:43:39.127
Hepatitis B, is to find
patients, find individuals who

00:43:39.127 --> 00:43:41.889
are already infected with
Hepatitis B.

00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:45.403
So, Hepatitis is already
infecting cells of their liver,

00:43:45.403 --> 00:43:48.150
their liver is actively making
new virus.

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:51.519
It turns out in the case of
Hepatitis B, the way the

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:55.548
lifecycle proceeds--the cells
make too much of the protein and

00:43:55.548 --> 00:43:58.719
not all of it gets assembled
into the virus.

00:43:58.719 --> 00:44:02.319
So, if you look in the blood of
patients that are infected with

00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:05.860
Hepatitis B you find a lot of
Hepatitis B surface subunits,

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:10.099
proteins without the nucleic
acid circulating in their blood.

00:44:10.099 --> 00:44:13.539
What if I collect that blood
from patients that are already

00:44:13.539 --> 00:44:17.746
infected with Hepatitis B,
purify the Hepatitis B protein,

00:44:17.746 --> 00:44:20.539
and inject that back into
people?

00:44:20.539 --> 00:44:24.818
That would be a subunit vaccine
because I'm purifying a subunit

00:44:24.818 --> 00:44:28.820
of the virus that could be
injected and hopefully induce an

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.500
immune response.
It turns out that that works.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:38.679
Any potential problems with
that approach?

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:40.340
Would you like to get that
vaccine?

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.849
You've all been immunized for
Hepatitis B, would you be happy

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:50.250
to hear that that's where your
Hepatitis B vaccine came from?

00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:53.010
It's okay?

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.711
Sounds okay?
Student:

00:44:59.711 --> 00:45:01.234
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: It does sound okay

00:45:01.234 --> 00:45:03.411
and it does work.
The danger is that it's being

00:45:03.411 --> 00:45:06.933
purified from patients that have
a disease and so you want to

00:45:06.933 --> 00:45:10.454
make sure that there's not other
diseases that are present in

00:45:10.454 --> 00:45:14.656
that sample at the same time.
The Hepatitis B subunit vaccine

00:45:14.656 --> 00:45:18.358
was produced at the same time
that HIV-AIDS was being

00:45:18.358 --> 00:45:21.420
recognized as a problem in this
country.

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.489
We did not yet have good
methods for screening blood to

00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:26.592
look for HIV,
we didn't have the ELISA

00:45:26.592 --> 00:45:29.945
technique that I--we talked
about in section a few weeks ago

00:45:29.945 --> 00:45:33.185
and so there was a great concern
that there might be other

00:45:33.185 --> 00:45:36.595
diseases that you'd be passing
on from--unknowingly from this

00:45:36.595 --> 00:45:40.460
subset of patients that you're
isolating the vaccine from.

00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.880
So, that particular sub unit
vaccine was only used in people

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:46.780
that are at high risk for
acquiring Hepatitis B,

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.927
that is, people that work in
healthcare situations that are

00:45:49.927 --> 00:45:52.639
exposed to blood routinely as
part of their job.

00:45:52.639 --> 00:45:54.679
It wasn't used in the general
population.

00:45:54.679 --> 00:45:59.013
What was--the vaccine you
got was produced totally outside

00:45:59.013 --> 00:46:02.210
of people using recombinant DNA
technology.

00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:05.038
In that case,
we took the gene for the

00:46:05.038 --> 00:46:08.697
Hepatitis B protein.
Took it out of the virus

00:46:08.697 --> 00:46:13.065
completely, cloned it into a
plasmid, that plasmid was

00:46:13.065 --> 00:46:17.508
expressed in a foreign host,
in this case it was expressed

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.885
in yeast cells.
Yeast cells were grown in large

00:46:20.885 --> 00:46:24.728
numbers with this plasmid
inside, they expressed the

00:46:24.728 --> 00:46:28.796
plasmid and so you made
Hepatitis B surface antigen not

00:46:28.796 --> 00:46:32.865
in people but in cell culture
where it was not normally

00:46:32.865 --> 00:46:36.811
formed.
Then that subunit was purified

00:46:36.811 --> 00:46:42.787
and formulated into the vaccine,
the kinds of vaccines that you

00:46:42.787 --> 00:46:46.885
and I got.
This was an early example of

00:46:46.885 --> 00:46:52.778
recombinant DNA technology being
translated into a clinical

00:46:52.778 --> 00:46:58.875
product and that's the vaccine
that's widely used in practice

00:46:58.875 --> 00:47:01.559
now.
Another approach which is

00:47:01.559 --> 00:47:04.611
still investigational,
in that it's being tried for

00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:07.479
many diseases but not yet
clinically used in any

00:47:07.479 --> 00:47:10.542
particular one,
is maybe you don't need to

00:47:10.542 --> 00:47:14.440
introduce a whole virus or
pieces of a protein at all.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.760
What if you took,
instead of using--instead of

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.967
going through the step of
isolating the gene for Hepatitis

00:47:21.967 --> 00:47:24.163
B,
cloning that into a plasmid,

00:47:24.163 --> 00:47:27.356
expressing the plasmid in
cells, manufacturing these

00:47:27.356 --> 00:47:30.655
cells,
and then purifying the protein

00:47:30.655 --> 00:47:36.127
product--what if you just took
that plasmid that contains the

00:47:36.127 --> 00:47:41.690
gene for Hepatitis B and you
gave that directly to people?

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:46.761
Then, you could get the
Hepatitis B protein expressed in

00:47:46.761 --> 00:47:49.513
your cells.
If we injected it into a muscle

00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:52.269
let's say, and your muscle cells
took up this plasmid.

00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:56.439
Now the plasmid started to do
its thing, which is replicate

00:47:56.439 --> 00:48:00.298
and the gene gets transcribed.
Then, your muscle cells would

00:48:00.298 --> 00:48:03.415
start producing Hepatitis B
surface antigen and your immune

00:48:03.415 --> 00:48:06.317
system recognizing that's a
foreign protein would start

00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:09.275
responding to it.
That concept is called

00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:12.179
DNA-based vaccine,
or DNA vaccines.

00:48:12.179 --> 00:48:16.375
So, totally avoids the
manufacturing processes that are

00:48:16.375 --> 00:48:21.695
used to produce other vaccines;
you got to manufacture DNA

00:48:21.695 --> 00:48:24.564
instead.
I want to say a little bit

00:48:24.564 --> 00:48:28.136
about the cost of vaccines
because this is a part of what

00:48:28.136 --> 00:48:31.964
makes it difficult to accomplish
what's usually our goal in a

00:48:31.964 --> 00:48:35.514
vaccine development,
which is deliver the vaccine to

00:48:35.514 --> 00:48:39.083
every population in the world.
Often, vaccines cost a

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:42.881
considerable amount to produce.
The Hepatitis B vaccine I

00:48:42.881 --> 00:48:46.366
talked about before produced by
recombinant DNA technologies,

00:48:46.366 --> 00:48:49.269
called Recombivax HB,
that's one version of it.

00:48:49.269 --> 00:48:52.467
If you or I buy it,
it costs $51 per dose,

00:48:52.467 --> 00:48:55.510
you need three doses to be
effective.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.900
Why do you need three doses of
Hepatitis B?

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.675
Because this is not a virus at
all, but it's a virus subunit,

00:49:01.675 --> 00:49:04.570
your body doesn't respond to it
as strongly,

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.820
your immune system doesn't
respond to it as strongly.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.030
So, you have to formulate it
properly.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:12.670
That is, mix it with things
which make it more--make your

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:15.139
immune system respond more
strongly.

00:49:15.139 --> 00:49:18.875
You have to inject it multiple
times because the first blip

00:49:18.875 --> 00:49:22.159
that you get in immune response
is not very high,

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:25.752
you have to boost and often you
have to boost again in order to

00:49:25.752 --> 00:49:28.360
get a high enough response to be
protected.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:34.940
For any one of us it costs $153
- $156 to be immunized.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:38.767
Now, that is doable for us but
that's not affordable in many

00:49:38.767 --> 00:49:40.820
parts of the world.
In addition,

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:44.044
this is just the cost of the
vaccine, not the cost of the

00:49:44.044 --> 00:49:46.289
doctor or nurse who injects it
into,

00:49:46.289 --> 00:49:48.940
you so you have to figure that
cost in as well.

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.184
The CDC can buy this from
the manufacturer for a lower

00:49:52.184 --> 00:49:55.258
price, and when you hear about
government organizations

00:49:55.258 --> 00:49:58.559
distributing vaccines to
different parts of the world,

00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:01.645
they're buying at a reduced
rate but it's still not

00:50:01.645 --> 00:50:03.460
inexpensive.
Measles, Mumps,

00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:06.756
and Rubella this is an
established vaccine also quite

00:50:06.756 --> 00:50:09.645
expensive.
I didn't have the commercial

00:50:09.645 --> 00:50:13.923
price for the chickenpox vaccine
called Varivax but you can

00:50:13.923 --> 00:50:18.349
imagine that it's even more than
$50 a dose for that one.

00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:20.199
I just wanted to try to put
that in perspective.

00:50:20.199 --> 00:50:23.900
I also talked last time
about smallpox and the perceived

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.288
need to produce more smallpox
vaccine in the event that

00:50:27.288 --> 00:50:29.860
smallpox is used as a weapon in
2002.

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:33.373
So shortly after 9/11 the
Government made a contract to a

00:50:33.373 --> 00:50:37.075
company called Acambis to make
four hundred million doses of

00:50:37.075 --> 00:50:39.460
smallpox for $343 million
dollars.

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.333
So, this is not cheap, right?
The problem is you've got to

00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:45.877
make hundreds of millions of
doses sometimes in order to have

00:50:45.877 --> 00:50:48.239
an effect on progress of the
disease.

00:50:48.239 --> 00:50:52.089
So, even if the cost is small,
$10 a dose, it quickly amounts

00:50:52.089 --> 00:50:55.486
to a large amount of money.
There were some problems with

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:58.293
that deal and I just give you
one news report on that,

00:50:58.293 --> 00:51:00.730
but you can follow it if you're
interested.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.804
In spite of that fact,
it turns out that vaccines are

00:51:04.804 --> 00:51:09.023
one of the best uses of our
money in terms of extending the

00:51:09.023 --> 00:51:12.115
lives of population.
This is old data now,

00:51:12.115 --> 00:51:15.510
from 1995, but I don't think
it's changed very much.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:19.174
It asks the question,
'how much do different public

00:51:19.174 --> 00:51:22.400
health interventions cost per
life saved?'

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.199
So, we have a mandatory
seatbelt law here.

00:51:25.199 --> 00:51:27.519
That means that you have to
have seatbelts in all your cars;

00:51:27.519 --> 00:51:29.478
that means people pay more for
cars because they have

00:51:29.478 --> 00:51:31.204
seatbelts.
You have to enforce the law and

00:51:31.204 --> 00:51:32.889
all the costs that goes along
with that.

00:51:32.889 --> 00:51:37.291
In terms of lives saved by that
measure, it's estimated that it

00:51:37.291 --> 00:51:41.550
cost about $69 per life saved,
so that's a reasonable cost to

00:51:41.550 --> 00:51:43.966
spend.
For something like Measles,

00:51:43.966 --> 00:51:47.758
Mumps, and Rubella immunization
which costs what I showed you

00:51:47.758 --> 00:51:50.712
before,
you can save so many lives that

00:51:50.712 --> 00:51:54.459
way that the cost of
distributing and producing the

00:51:54.459 --> 00:51:58.955
vaccine is actually less than
the value of the lives that are

00:51:58.955 --> 00:52:01.322
saved.
So, it saves money,

00:52:01.322 --> 00:52:05.951
you're saving money by doing
it, not that it's not costing

00:52:05.951 --> 00:52:07.367
you.
Obviously,

00:52:07.367 --> 00:52:10.939
these are complex calculations,
but I just want to point out

00:52:10.939 --> 00:52:13.179
that and smoking cessation
advice,

00:52:13.179 --> 00:52:17.140
advice about not smoking to
pregnant women is another very

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.849
inexpensive life saving
intervention.

00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:23.472
Things that we think are good,
and I'm not advocating we don't

00:52:23.472 --> 00:52:26.916
do them, like having radiation
emission standards for power

00:52:26.916 --> 00:52:28.953
plants,
nuclear power plants,

00:52:28.953 --> 00:52:32.510
and other power plants cost a
lot of money per the risk

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:35.670
involved with them.
On this scale,

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:41.900
vaccines are a very inexpensive
way to save lives.

00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.337
Okay, we'll stop there,
section this afternoon,

00:52:44.337 --> 00:52:47.410
we'll talk about disease spread
through populations and how

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:48.876
vaccines impact that.

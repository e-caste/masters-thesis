00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.240
Prof: I'm going to begin
by going over briefly the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.801
episodes that I didn't get to
cover in the last lecture

00:00:10.801 --> 00:00:13.420
because we ran out of time.
 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.604
Of course, I am not going to go
over every single episode in the

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.979
novel, otherwise,
we would be here for the whole

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:19.940
year, at least.
 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.236
But I thought I'd say a few
things about the adventure of

00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:26.750
the dead body.
 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.191
We have moved from the
brightness of the road to the

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:36.780
darkness of the episode of the
dead body.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.011
This is another instance where
appearances conspire to fool Don

00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.616
Quixote,
although here it is,

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.861
as the text says,
seeing artificial,

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:52.654
that is, without artifice,
without--because he doesn't

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:56.937
turn to people with a corpse
into characters from the

00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:00.743
chivalric romances;
this is what is unique about

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:01.740
this episode.
 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.784
Reality, as it is,
is strange enough,

00:01:04.784 --> 00:01:09.435
so he does not try to turn them
into characters from the

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.379
chivalric romances.
 

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:15.391
Don Quixote's reaction is still
to attack, as he did the monks

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:19.140
in the episode leading to the
fight with the Biscainer.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.024
This is another episode with
some religious resonances and we

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:27.769
will have a few and we have had
some before.

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:32.313
The episode of the merchants of
Toledo, for instance,

00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:34.760
is one that comes to mind.
 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.227
It has religious resonances
because it is a funeral

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:42.890
procession and because one of
the men,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.879
the one injured by Don Quixote,
claims to be an ecclesiastic.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:52.310
After all is said and done,
it turns out he's not quite

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.690
ordained yet,
and so forth.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.434
Sancho, again,
fears the police because now

00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:04.968
Don Quixote has injured a person
of some note,

00:02:04.968 --> 00:02:11.259
and Don Quixote may now be
excommunicated from the church

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:17.048
for having injured someone,
even who is going to become a

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:20.050
priest and who's not yet a
priest,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.860
so he's now not only a fugitive
from justice,

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.062
but in some ways,
also, a fugitive from the

00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:29.750
church.
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.897
Now, this is the episode,
also, where Sancho calls Don

00:02:34.897 --> 00:02:39.949
Quixote the Caballero de la
Triste Figura,

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:46.949
which Jarvis translates as a
Knight of the Sorrowful Figure.

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.765
This is on page one
thirty-nine, which brings us

00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:57.710
back to characters with physical
defects that I spoke about

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.652
before,
and certainly Don Quixote,

00:03:00.652 --> 00:03:05.161
as we will see in the quote,
has some marks and physical

00:03:05.161 --> 00:03:11.907
defects that make him stand out,
and lead to Sancho's calling

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:13.180
him that.
 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.598
When asked by Don Quixote why
he called him such a name,

00:03:19.598 --> 00:03:23.239
Sancho answers that:
"because I have been

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.848
viewing you by the light of the
torch that unfortunate man

00:03:27.848 --> 00:03:29.794
carried;
and in truth,

00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:33.470
your worship makes,
at present, very near the most

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.179
woeful figure I have ever seen;
which must be occasioned either

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:45.598
by the fatigue of this combat,
or by your want of teeth."

00:03:45.598 --> 00:03:49.157
Because you remember that he
has lost several teeth,

00:03:49.157 --> 00:03:53.133
having been struck by one of
the stones that the shepherds

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.318
hit him with.
 

00:03:54.318 --> 00:03:58.816
So this is a part about his
physical defect,

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:03.104
his injuries,
and uniqueness as a physical

00:04:03.104 --> 00:04:04.150
being.
 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.601
But at issue is also Don
Quixote's awareness that his

00:04:08.601 --> 00:04:11.939
adventures will be written,
or, in fact,

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:14.680
that they are being written.
 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.512
And Sancho's invention of the
epithet has taken place as the

00:04:18.512 --> 00:04:21.629
text is being composed,
the text that we read.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.654
This is consonant with the
issue of the novel being a work

00:04:26.654 --> 00:04:31.857
in progress, not a fixed text,
but one that is being made as

00:04:31.857 --> 00:04:33.180
we read it.
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.666
This is a very significant
passage that I don't think has

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:43.531
been remarked on by criticism,
but it is page 139 to 140,

00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:48.771
at the bottom of page 139,
when Sancho has just explained

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:55.968
that he looks the way he looks
for the reasons that I have just

00:04:55.968 --> 00:04:59.401
given,
and then Don Quixote replies:

00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:03.629
"'It is owing to neither,'
replied Don Quixote,

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:07.365
'but the sage,
who has the charge of writing

00:05:07.365 --> 00:05:12.994
the history of my achievements,
has thought fit I should assume

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:15.726
a surname,
as all the knights of old were

00:05:15.726 --> 00:05:18.894
wont to do: one called himself
'The Knight of the Burning

00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:22.139
Sword';
another, that 'of the Unicorn';

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.214
this 'of the Damsels';
that 'of the Phoenix'..."

00:05:27.214 --> 00:05:29.579
And so forth and so on.
 

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:35.767
So if you read carefully you
realize that Don Quixote assumes

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:41.853
that it is being written as they
go, which creates a kind of

00:05:41.853 --> 00:05:43.709
impossibility.
 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:47.470
How can it be written as they
act?

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.281
Are they following a script,
or is the writing following

00:05:50.281 --> 00:05:51.050
what they do?
 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.740
This is left unclear,
but it feeds into all of the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.035
meditations that you find in the
novel about the nature of

00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:02.199
literature, and the nature of
writing.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.540
Now, in addition,
in this episode death becomes a

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.209
presence in the novel.
 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:15.838
During the brawl at the inn Don
Quixote was taken for dead--

00:06:15.838 --> 00:06:21.180
if you remember--which will
happen again in the novel,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.132
GrisÃ³stomo's dead body
presides over the episode about

00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:31.759
his tragic love for Marcela;
so this episode highlights that

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:35.009
presence of death in the novel.
 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.468
Death brings an element of
seriousness to these comical

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:43.865
episodes,
it lurks as a reminder of the

00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:50.793
characters' vulnerability and
generally of the human need to

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:56.430
create art in the face of
certain extinction.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:05.507
And here I want to bring in two
lines from a poem by Wallace

00:07:05.507 --> 00:07:09.802
Stevens,
the great American poet,

00:07:09.802 --> 00:07:16.199
about whom you will hear a
little more in today's lecture.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.250
And the line is:
"Death,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:25.567
mother of beauty within whose
bosom will devise our earthly

00:07:25.567 --> 00:07:30.360
mothers,"
meaning death drives humans to

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.540
create beauty.
 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:37.017
So this is why the presence of
death in the Quixote in a

00:07:37.017 --> 00:07:39.329
general sense is so important.
 

00:07:39.329 --> 00:07:42.970
Now, the adventure of the
fulling hammers--

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.529
we don't know what a fulling
hammer is,

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:47.959
we don't know what it is in
Spanish,

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.649
batanes,
they don't exist any more.

00:07:49.649 --> 00:07:54.983
This was kind of a machinery to
spin wool or something that is

00:07:54.983 --> 00:08:00.225
driven by hydraulic force,
by a river or a stream going

00:08:00.225 --> 00:08:03.610
by, and it makes this awful
noise.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:08.838
We continue in the darkness,
but there is strange noise that

00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:13.536
frightens the protagonist,
although Don Quixote denies

00:08:13.536 --> 00:08:16.639
that he's frightened adamantly.
 

00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:20.798
But this episode has four
elements that I want to bring

00:08:20.798 --> 00:08:21.259
out.
 

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:27.528
First is the story of
goatherdess Torralba--Remember,

00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:29.699
she's the one...
 

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.307
This episode,
this cuento de nunca

00:08:33.307 --> 00:08:37.615
acabar, this never-ending
story is told,

00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:43.730
the story about the sheep being
brought across the river.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:47.027
Sancho is telling the story,
and he tells Don Quixote,

00:08:47.027 --> 00:08:50.697
please, do not interrupt me,
and keep track of the number of

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.320
sheep.
 

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.928
He says, All right.
 

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:54.480
So at one point he asks,
"how many sheep?",

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.058
and Don Quixote says,
"I can't remember,"

00:08:56.058 --> 00:08:59.779
and that's the end of the
story, and Don Quixote is very

00:08:59.779 --> 00:09:00.658
angry, why?
 

00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:03.363
And he says,
well, because I told you those

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:05.678
were the conditions,
and so forth.

00:09:05.678 --> 00:09:08.048
Now, this is a story that is
very funny,

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:12.206
it's also a love story,
if you look into it between

00:09:12.206 --> 00:09:17.625
these two goatherds,
but it is also a story in which

00:09:17.625 --> 00:09:23.278
the issue of language and
reality is underlined,

00:09:23.278 --> 00:09:28.830
because here Sancho is
demanding a kind of literality.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.522
I mean, literally:
one sheep, you say 'sheep' and

00:09:31.522 --> 00:09:33.485
there is one sheep,
you say 'sheep',

00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:35.000
there is another sheep.
 

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.953
You have to count every single
one, language cannot abstractly

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:41.870
say forty-five sheep,
it has to say one sheep,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.399
two sheep, three sheep,
four sheep.

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:50.389
This is a very elementary way
of conceiving of language,

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:56.321
but this is what Cervantes is
bringing in that these folk

00:09:56.321 --> 00:10:02.464
tales sometimes contain very
interesting elements about the

00:10:02.464 --> 00:10:05.428
nature of story telling.
 

00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:09.384
Now, this is--I don't know if
you know any such stories,

00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:13.269
but I remember in my childhood
hearing some of them.

00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:16.436
Now, the second part we have
already mentioned,

00:10:16.436 --> 00:10:19.946
and it's the fact that Sancho
defecates out of fear,

00:10:19.946 --> 00:10:20.908
of course.
 

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:23.220
Sancho goes to the bathroom out
of fear.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:27.664
He tries to hide it from Don
Quixote, but Don Quixote smells

00:10:27.664 --> 00:10:32.186
it and tells him to please move
away, that he can't stand the

00:10:32.186 --> 00:10:32.940
smell.
 

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:38.671
Classics of literature--I think
I said this at the end of the

00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:43.067
class after the lecture--
classics of literature contain

00:10:43.067 --> 00:10:45.370
the whole range of human
experience,

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.759
including the most humble
physical functions,

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:54.279
and this is an instance of that.
 

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:57.080
There are similar episodes in
Chaucer,

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.379
I'm sure, as you remember,
and in Dante also,

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:05.047
in Inferno,
there are various scatological

00:11:05.047 --> 00:11:10.414
episodes in Dante,
too, but none as humble as this

00:11:10.414 --> 00:11:16.852
instance where Sancho cannot
contain himself and has to go to

00:11:16.852 --> 00:11:18.570
the bathroom.
 

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:24.285
Another element is the fact
that Don Quixote beats Sancho

00:11:24.285 --> 00:11:26.940
over the head,
in anger.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:32.413
This continues to round off the
relationship between these two

00:11:32.413 --> 00:11:33.580
characters.
 

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.830
It's a relationship that
includes tenderness,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.154
it includes anger,
and that is very thoroughly

00:11:40.154 --> 00:11:42.149
developed in the novel.
 

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:46.464
This is something new that,
in a way, Cervantes really

00:11:46.464 --> 00:11:47.360
invented.
 

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.966
And finally,
what I would like to bring out

00:11:50.966 --> 00:11:56.293
the question of how does Sancho
know that there is water in the

00:11:56.293 --> 00:11:57.408
vicinity?
 

00:11:57.408 --> 00:11:59.469
Remember, he says,
oh, there must be water around

00:11:59.469 --> 00:11:59.769
here.
 

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:03.470
And how can he tell time by the
stars?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.269
He knows what time it is by the
stars.

00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:08.399
Well, here, we learn--you may
remember,

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:12.038
and I've always asked you to
read for details--

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:14.658
that Sancho says that he was a
shepherd once,

00:12:14.658 --> 00:12:21.028
and hence he learned how to
find water for his animals and

00:12:21.028 --> 00:12:23.600
fresh grass for them.
 

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:28.879
I think the significant thing
here is that we begin to learn

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:32.278
about Sancho's past
retrospectively.

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:37.210
It's not as if at the beginning
the narrator told us Sancho,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.450
who was a shepherd,
this, and that,

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.004
and the other,
and then he begins the

00:12:41.004 --> 00:12:42.759
adventures,
to begin to learn

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:46.821
retrospectively about Sancho's
activities in the past and how

00:12:46.821 --> 00:12:48.918
he came to be who he is now.
 

00:12:48.918 --> 00:12:55.460
This is a very effective device
to fill out the character,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.986
and I want you to notice it
because there will be other

00:12:58.986 --> 00:13:02.841
instances where we will find out
other things about Sancho's

00:13:02.841 --> 00:13:03.428
past.
 

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:09.778
So his life is filled in on the
go,

00:13:09.778 --> 00:13:14.210
not following a conventional
chronological progression,

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.346
this is what I want you to take
notice of as a narrative

00:13:18.346 --> 00:13:19.250
technique.
 

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.149
Those are the episodes that I
didn't get to in the last class.

00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:27.163
And now, we get to the second
part of today's class,

00:13:27.163 --> 00:13:30.470
which has to do with these
three topics.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.369
Now, why does Cervantes,
and why does the Quixote

00:13:35.369 --> 00:13:40.178
focus so much on low class types
and even criminals?

00:13:40.178 --> 00:13:43.144
This is something I've talked
about before,

00:13:43.144 --> 00:13:46.038
but I will be harping upon
again today.

00:13:46.038 --> 00:13:49.220
Now, we have spoken about
Maritornes,

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.658
who is a prostitute,
but there are others,

00:13:52.658 --> 00:13:55.798
like for instance,
the servant who beats up Don

00:13:55.798 --> 00:13:59.620
Quixote in the episode about the
merchants of Toledo,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:05.788
the rowdies,
who toss Sancho in the blanket,

00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:09.001
AndrÃ©s,
who's being beaten by his

00:14:09.001 --> 00:14:13.450
master but who seems to be a
pÃ­caro himself,

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:18.178
the first innkeeper,
who was, I've called him,

00:14:18.178 --> 00:14:21.921
a retired pÃ­caro,
and the prostitutes at the

00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:22.820
first inn.
 

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.220
We will meet others,
quite a few other such types.

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.653
As we talk about the galley
slaves episode today we will be

00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:34.558
attempting to answer this
question,

00:14:34.558 --> 00:14:37.570
why the focus on these kinds of
characters,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:42.009
about the abundance of low
class types and outlaws?

00:14:42.009 --> 00:14:46.129
By the way, galley slaves--I
say this because I'm sure that

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:48.899
you have never heard of this
before,

00:14:48.899 --> 00:14:50.620
it's not something that we are
familiar with--

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.491
galeotes in Spanish,
were prisoners or legally

00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:59.990
slaves who were forced to row in
the galleys,

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:04.490
be they private or more often
owned by the crown.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.278
That is, the ships move with
sails,

00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:12.705
but also with ores,
and the ores were manned by the

00:15:12.705 --> 00:15:16.847
galley slaves,
who sat in rows inside,

00:15:16.847 --> 00:15:21.778
and were whipped to row harder
and harder.

00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:24.690
It's a terrible kind of
punishment,

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:27.662
and I can go in detail about
the lengths of the sentences

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:29.421
there,
and the fact that most of them

00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:31.451
didn't come back alive,
and so forth,

00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:34.038
but that's what a galley slave
is.

00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:38.452
The closest I think we have is
those chain gangs that we see

00:15:38.452 --> 00:15:43.015
occasionally in some states of
prisoners going around in their

00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:45.558
striped uniforms and so forth.
 

00:15:45.558 --> 00:15:50.645
Now, let me anticipate some
ideas and redirect others that I

00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:56.163
have already mentioned before to
give a context to what I'm going

00:15:56.163 --> 00:15:57.629
to be saying.
 

00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:01.535
The Renaissance is interested
in the nature of humankind

00:16:01.535 --> 00:16:03.808
relatively independent of God.
 

00:16:03.808 --> 00:16:07.371
Renaissance thinkers and
artists focus on characters like

00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:09.418
the wild men,
for instance,

00:16:09.418 --> 00:16:13.928
who are close to nature and
does reveal their belonging to

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:18.259
the natural world,
rather than to the social world.

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:22.240
The wild man is an individual
lost in the woods or in some

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.639
cave, who lives in a state of
nature, away from civilization.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:31.216
In Spanish literature,
the best-known example is

00:16:31.216 --> 00:16:34.655
Segismundo,
the protagonist of Life is a

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:37.869
Dream,
a play by Pedro CalderÃ³n

00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:41.989
de la Barca that I will be
mentioning often during the

00:16:41.989 --> 00:16:45.317
semester--
You may have heard of him

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:46.058
before.
 

00:16:46.058 --> 00:16:49.931
These Renaissance thinkers and
artists also concentrate on

00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:53.461
individuals who willfully become
marginal to society,

00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:55.500
like madmen and criminals.
 

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.506
The underlying idea is that
society masks,

00:16:59.506 --> 00:17:04.980
erases, or attenuates
fundamental traits of the human.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:10.431
There is also an aesthetic
reason, social individuals are

00:17:10.431 --> 00:17:13.940
types;
individuals in society become

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.598
types.
 

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:20.345
Their features are determined
by social conventions attached

00:17:20.345 --> 00:17:25.240
to their station or trade,
whereas marginal figures are

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.568
individual in their appearance
and behavior.

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:34.103
Don Quixote and Sancho will
meet characters like Diego de

00:17:34.103 --> 00:17:37.829
Miranda,
the man in green in Part II,

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:43.490
who lead boring lives because
they conform to social norms.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:50.390
He is a rich hidalgo who lives
a life of ease in his estate,

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:54.440
and who lodges the knight and
his squire for several days in

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:58.808
his very comfortable house,
until Don Quixote gets bored.

00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:02.308
Don Quixote and the
pÃ­caros he meets,

00:18:02.308 --> 00:18:04.993
on the other hand,
are not boring,

00:18:04.993 --> 00:18:07.680
they lead lives of adventure.
 

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.858
They are appealing because of
their deviations,

00:18:10.858 --> 00:18:14.792
just as they're physically
attractive because of the

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:19.190
deformities that they bear as we
saw in the last class.

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:22.916
Of course, epic heroes and
protagonists of chivalric

00:18:22.916 --> 00:18:26.718
romances led very interesting
lives, needless to say,

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:28.400
full of adventures.
 

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.200
But those adventures took place
in a distant and vague past and

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.755
in abstract countries,
with generic qualities drawn

00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:42.535
from literary conventions,
whereas the pÃ­caros and

00:18:42.535 --> 00:18:46.845
Don Quixote live in the present,
and live in a society that the

00:18:46.845 --> 00:18:49.380
reader recognizes as his own.
 

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:57.190
The clash between the two is at
the core of Don Quixote,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:02.528
of course, but the point is
that except in his imagination

00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:07.961
Don Quixote never inhabits a
world other than that of Spain

00:19:07.961 --> 00:19:12.924
in the late sixteenth century
among people involved in

00:19:12.924 --> 00:19:18.920
ordinary activities who do not
violate the laws of nature.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.820
No one flies,
for instance,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:25.468
in the Quixote,
or performs feats that are

00:19:25.468 --> 00:19:30.467
beyond human strength,
as happens in the epic,

00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:34.950
or as happens in the romances
of chivalry.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:41.092
We are about to come into an
episode where this clash between

00:19:41.092 --> 00:19:47.440
idealized time and space meet
real time present day Castile.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:55.972
I refer to the episode about
Mambrino's helmet in chapter

00:19:55.972 --> 00:19:58.780
XXI,
and here is where your handout

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.483
may be of some use,
because in the visual part of

00:20:03.483 --> 00:20:08.650
the handout I have there a
barber's basin.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.550
I have the depiction of a
barber's basin because no one in

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.288
this room has ever seen a
barber's basin,

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:18.095
even myself,
because they are no longer in

00:20:18.095 --> 00:20:18.778
use.
 

00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:21.940
A barber's basin is this device
that the barber would use,

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:27.066
and it has an indentation like
that to put it under the

00:20:27.066 --> 00:20:29.892
person's chin,
and for the neck,

00:20:29.892 --> 00:20:33.960
and then to wash the beard and
the water to fall in it,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.440
and so I wanted you to have it,
a depiction of that,

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.588
so that you will know what we
are talking about here.

00:20:42.588 --> 00:20:45.355
Why Sancho says what a huge
head this giant had,

00:20:45.355 --> 00:20:48.180
because of course,
it's a big basin like that.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.842
So there are two important
elements in the Mambrino helmet

00:20:52.842 --> 00:20:57.913
episode which is one of the most
famous and discussed in the

00:20:57.913 --> 00:21:02.983
Quixote because it brings to
the fore the discussions about

00:21:02.983 --> 00:21:07.645
the nature of the real that
dominates the discussion among

00:21:07.645 --> 00:21:10.891
the characters,
but particularly,

00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:14.788
between Don Quixote and Sancho,
as they do here.

00:21:14.788 --> 00:21:20.798
The first element that I want
to bring out in this episode has

00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:26.808
to do with the oath Don Quixote
made earlier in chapter X,

00:21:26.808 --> 00:21:30.808
which by fulfilling it,
would close a loop in the plot.

00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:35.019
Upon seeing the barber's basin
shinning,

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:37.961
he remembers the oath that he
made when he discovered that

00:21:37.961 --> 00:21:41.057
part of his own helmet had been
damaged in the fight with the

00:21:41.057 --> 00:21:41.779
Biscainer.
 

00:21:41.779 --> 00:21:44.950
So he says that the opportunity
now,

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:50.210
when he sees the basin,
arises to fulfill the oath,

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:55.240
quote: "about which I
swore the oath."

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.493
As you know,
he tells Sancho on page 153,

00:21:58.493 --> 00:22:01.992
when he sees the basin,
he says, this is the

00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:05.980
opportunity to fulfill that oath
that I made.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.348
Don Quixote had sworn the
following after the fight with

00:22:10.348 --> 00:22:11.618
the Biscainer.
 

00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:15.259
I quote: "I swear by the
Creator of all things,

00:22:15.259 --> 00:22:19.200
and by all that is contained in
the four holy evangelists,

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.900
to lead the life of the great
Marquis of Mantua,

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.940
when he vowed to revenge the
death of his nephew Valdovinos,

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:30.460
which was not to eat bread on a
tablecloth,

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.269
nor solace himself with his
wife, and other things which,

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.210
though I do not now remember,
allow here for expressed,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.455
until I am fully revenged on
him who hath done me this

00:22:40.455 --> 00:22:41.577
outrage."
 

00:22:41.577 --> 00:22:42.460
Unquote.
 

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.523
Of course, the outrage is the
damage to the helmet that he can

00:22:47.523 --> 00:22:52.671
now restore with a new one that
approaches and that he plans to

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:54.000
appropriate.
 

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.058
The novel begins to acquire,
this is the point,

00:22:57.058 --> 00:23:01.630
an inner density and substance
by means of these links,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.558
these connections within the
plot, one linked to the other,

00:23:06.558 --> 00:23:09.778
the oath and the fulfillment of
the oath.

00:23:09.778 --> 00:23:15.006
Now, the second element that I
want to bring up has to do,

00:23:15.006 --> 00:23:20.599
of course, with the confusion
created by the wet shining basin

00:23:20.599 --> 00:23:23.259
that looks like a helmet.
 

00:23:23.259 --> 00:23:28.124
Mambrino's helmet belongs to
the traditional Roland and his

00:23:28.124 --> 00:23:35.038
various incarnations as Orlando,
Roland, Roland,

00:23:35.038 --> 00:23:46.632
Orlando, who becomes Orlando--
This the Carolingian cycle of

00:23:46.632 --> 00:23:53.029
chivalry that I mentioned in one
of my early lectures.

00:23:53.029 --> 00:24:00.480
Mambrino's helmet is one with
Rolandian literature in Boiardo,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.718
Matteo Boiardo,
a poem called "Orlando

00:24:03.718 --> 00:24:06.670
innamorato,"
Orlando in love,

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.849
Reinaldo de MontalbÃ¡n
kills the Moorish king Mambrino,

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.598
and wins his enchanted helmet.
 

00:24:13.598 --> 00:24:16.088
In Ariosto Orlando
furioso--whom I have

00:24:16.088 --> 00:24:19.020
mentioned before and will
mention several times in the

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:22.500
course of the semester--
the enchanted helmet had been

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.760
won from the Moorish king
Mambrino by Dardaniel de

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.769
Almonte--
not Sacripante,

00:24:27.769 --> 00:24:31.384
as Don Quixote misremembers--
and Reinaldo de

00:24:31.384 --> 00:24:35.368
MontalbÃ¡n wins it when he
kills Dardaniel.

00:24:35.368 --> 00:24:39.200
So this is the background of
Mambrino's helmet.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.857
In his imagination,
Don Quixote acts like the

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:49.787
Carolingian hero in obtaining
the helmet from the Moorish

00:24:49.787 --> 00:24:50.740
king.
 

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:54.602
So Mambrino's helmet has an
incontestable chivalric

00:24:54.602 --> 00:24:56.659
pedigree,
a deep pedigree,

00:24:56.659 --> 00:25:00.894
which makes it all of the more
ridiculous that it be confused

00:25:00.894 --> 00:25:02.660
with a barber's basin.
 

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:08.212
So you have to have this
background to realize the

00:25:08.212 --> 00:25:15.578
distance between this Mambrino's
helmet and the barber's basin.

00:25:15.578 --> 00:25:17.740
This is why I wanted to give
you that background.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:22.031
But there are attenuating
circumstances where Don

00:25:22.031 --> 00:25:25.519
Quixote's error reality
contingency--

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:27.368
when I say contingency I mean
accidents--

00:25:27.368 --> 00:25:31.940
conspire to confuse him,
as in the case of the dead

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:32.578
body.
 

00:25:32.578 --> 00:25:37.464
The basin is not being used for
what it's intended,

00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:40.690
for what it was intended to do.
 

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.753
The barber has it on his head
to protect his new hat from the

00:25:45.753 --> 00:25:47.246
rain--
remember the detail,

00:25:47.246 --> 00:25:49.858
he has a new hat and he puts it
on to protect it from the rain.

00:25:49.858 --> 00:25:54.130
This is the only time,
by the way,

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.348
in which it rains in the entire
Quixote,

00:25:56.348 --> 00:26:01.465
if you want to know a detail,
the only time when it rains in

00:26:01.465 --> 00:26:03.880
the entire--
it doesn't rain very often in

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.750
Castile, by the way.
 

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:10.446
Castile is very dry,
and so this is consistent with

00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:15.689
the real conditions of the
region--So it rains,

00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:20.588
and it's being used to protect
the hat.

00:26:20.588 --> 00:26:24.484
So the barber has it on his
head, I said,

00:26:24.484 --> 00:26:26.920
to protect his new hat.
 

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:30.425
The poor barber is the victim
of this mutation,

00:26:30.425 --> 00:26:32.180
of this circumstance.
 

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:38.500
It happens with other things in
the Quixote.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.707
As you know,
the inn was originally a

00:26:40.707 --> 00:26:44.078
stable, or parts of the inn were
originally a stable.

00:26:44.078 --> 00:26:47.374
In the real world,
things are adapted ad

00:26:47.374 --> 00:26:52.079
hoc for purposes other than
those they were made for,

00:26:52.079 --> 00:26:55.660
 
 

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:00.359
there essence does not
guarantee their usage,

00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:04.210
they are in flux.
 

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.213
Remember, what Don Quixote said
after the episode of the

00:27:07.213 --> 00:27:10.163
windmills about mutations,
how things are in a constant

00:27:10.163 --> 00:27:11.420
state of mutations.
 

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:18.210
So reality is in a state of
flux as is Don Quixote himself.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.594
Hence, he takes the shining
barber's basin for Mambrino's

00:27:23.594 --> 00:27:24.460
helmet.
 

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:30.105
This episode exemplifies the
modern radical doubt about the

00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:34.000
power of the senses to grasp
reality,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.450
which will become a topic of
the Baroque,

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.400
the period immediately,
or almost immediately,

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.874
after the Renaissance,
and about which I'll be talking

00:27:43.874 --> 00:27:45.118
a lot later on.
 

00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.573
Remember what I said about the
critical clichÃ©,

00:27:47.573 --> 00:27:50.164
that the first part of the
Quixote is Renaissance,

00:27:50.164 --> 00:27:51.598
the second part is Baroque.
 

00:27:51.598 --> 00:27:58.107
But the topic of our senses not
being able to really discern

00:27:58.107 --> 00:28:02.410
reality is one that is still
with us.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.413
It is a sort of doubt about the
real that we find even today in

00:28:07.413 --> 00:28:12.015
a modern poem such as Wallace
Stevens "Man Carrying a

00:28:12.015 --> 00:28:16.939
Thing," which is the poem
that you have on the other side

00:28:16.939 --> 00:28:19.200
of your handout today.
 

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:23.688
I bring up this poem because in
one or two occasions the basin

00:28:23.688 --> 00:28:26.790
is referred to as 'a thing',
"a thing that

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.068
shines,"
Sancho says,

00:28:28.068 --> 00:28:31.630
as of yet lacking ontological
and phenomenological

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.435
specificity--
the ontological is being,

00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:37.038
it's not specific,
it's appearance,

00:28:37.038 --> 00:28:39.710
it's phenomenology,
is not specific.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:42.640
And so it's called a thing.
 

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:46.348
And so I always,
when I come to this episode,

00:28:46.348 --> 00:28:48.308
think of this poem by Wallace
Stevens,

00:28:48.308 --> 00:28:49.960
Wallace Stevens being one of my
favorite,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.410
if not my favorite, poet.
 

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.271
He was an American poet,
1879-1955, who spent almost all

00:28:56.271 --> 00:29:00.064
of his life as an executive for
an insurance company in

00:29:00.064 --> 00:29:01.890
Hartford, Connecticut.
 

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:06.647
Nevertheless,
he was really one of the major

00:29:06.647 --> 00:29:08.528
American poets.
 

00:29:08.528 --> 00:29:10.118
So: "Man Carrying a
Thing"

00:29:10.118 --> 00:29:14.210
The poem must resist the
intelligence

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.240
Almost successfully.
 

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.448
Illustration:
A brune figure in winter

00:29:20.448 --> 00:29:23.109
evening resists
Identity.

00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:26.910
The thing he carries resists
The most necessitous sense.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.534
Accept them, then,
As secondary parts (parts not

00:29:31.534 --> 00:29:34.490
quite perceived
Of the obvious whole,

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:37.707
uncertain particles
Of the certain solid,

00:29:37.707 --> 00:29:42.748
the primary free from doubt,
Things floating like the first

00:29:42.748 --> 00:29:47.339
hundred flakes of snow
Out of a storm we must endure

00:29:47.339 --> 00:29:50.166
all night,
Out of a storm of secondary

00:29:50.166 --> 00:29:52.737
things),
A horror of thoughts that

00:29:52.737 --> 00:29:54.180
suddenly are real.
 

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.759
We must endure our thoughts all
night, until

00:29:57.759 --> 00:30:01.078
The bright obvious stands
motionless in cold."

00:30:01.078 --> 00:30:05.871
I don't think the bright
obvious ever stands motionless

00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:11.321
in cold in the Quixote,
but I think that this poem

00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:15.770
brings--dramatizes,
what is happening in this

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:20.833
episode with this thing,
that Don Quixote takes to be a

00:30:20.833 --> 00:30:24.712
helmet,
and Sancho knows is a barber's

00:30:24.712 --> 00:30:25.440
basin.
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:29.416
This is a Cartesian problem,
since it was Descartes who

00:30:29.416 --> 00:30:34.279
first gave full attention to it:
how do we really know the real?

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.892
Doubt, as the principle of
modern philosophy,

00:30:37.892 --> 00:30:40.108
is present here,
already.

00:30:40.108 --> 00:30:44.083
In this sense Cervantes takes
leave from Renaissance thought

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:48.259
and poetics as in many others
and moves towards the Baroque.

00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:54.334
The basin will reappear and
provoke a full-fledged

00:30:54.334 --> 00:30:57.489
discussion,
in the inn, among various

00:30:57.489 --> 00:31:00.500
characters about whether it is a
basin or a helmet,

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.240
with the basin there.
 

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.930
It's a hilarious parody of a
scholastic debate.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.653
The basin is one of those
things that the novel focuses

00:31:12.653 --> 00:31:14.765
on,
and that I told you to take

00:31:14.765 --> 00:31:17.819
notice of in connection with
Alberti's theories about

00:31:17.819 --> 00:31:20.153
perspective,
because the basin is seen in

00:31:20.153 --> 00:31:22.327
the distance,
in the depths,

00:31:22.327 --> 00:31:28.140
and this is why it is difficult
to ascertain what it is.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:33.564
Now, the second part of the
chapter contains what I called

00:31:33.564 --> 00:31:37.180
Don Quixote's own chivalric
romance.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.160
I don't know if you remember
this part, but you should.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.422
Here we see Don Quixote in the
act of creating a chivalric

00:31:44.422 --> 00:31:45.170
romance.
 

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:50.470
Remember, Sancho's asks him if
they shouldn't go and try to

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.769
gain some notoriety and fame by
doing important things,

00:31:55.769 --> 00:32:03.715
and so then Don Quixote
launches on this narrative about

00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:08.625
a chivalric romance,
which he creates out of

00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:11.660
elements drawn from many of
these romances.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.556
He has been able to condense
from various romances the

00:32:15.556 --> 00:32:19.380
essence of the chivalric
romance, the basic story.

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.490
This story reveals what he has
in his head.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:27.747
This probe into the mind of a
character is also new in

00:32:27.747 --> 00:32:28.740
fiction.
 

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:33.230
Here and elsewhere,
as in the case of Cardenio,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.568
whom you're going to meet right
away,

00:32:34.568 --> 00:32:40.068
we get intimations of a
character's subconscious,

00:32:40.068 --> 00:32:43.858
not just of his actions,
as was the case in the epic,

00:32:43.858 --> 00:32:47.118
the romances of chivalry,
and even in the picaresque.

00:32:47.118 --> 00:32:52.286
Here we get something about Don
Quixote's--this will happen

00:32:52.286 --> 00:32:54.868
several times in the novel.
 

00:32:54.868 --> 00:32:59.040
The story of this chivalric
romance is an exercise in

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:04.013
narrative, but which Cervantes
is underlying in the conventions

00:33:04.013 --> 00:33:08.298
of the chivalric genre;
the fact that there is a kind

00:33:08.298 --> 00:33:13.048
of basic blueprint or structure
upon which anyone can embroider.

00:33:13.048 --> 00:33:15.974
This is true,
by the way, of popular forms of

00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:18.223
narrative,
like James Bond movies,

00:33:18.223 --> 00:33:21.536
of which they keep making more,
and more, and more,

00:33:21.536 --> 00:33:24.259
because the basic blueprint is
there,

00:33:24.259 --> 00:33:27.698
and then all you have to do is
to make a slight change in one

00:33:27.698 --> 00:33:31.357
character here,
or a slight change in this kind

00:33:31.357 --> 00:33:35.440
of adventure,
and you have a James Bond.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.250
The same was true with Conan
Doyle,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.240
and Sherlock Holmes stories
and, of course,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.980
as I've mentioned several
times, with soap operas,

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.555
which is always--Latin American
soap operas is always that the

00:33:48.555 --> 00:33:52.828
poor secretary has an affair
with the son of the very rich

00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:55.252
boss,
and you go from there,

00:33:55.252 --> 00:33:58.548
and she has a baby,
or she doesn't have a baby,

00:33:58.548 --> 00:33:59.430
and you know.
 

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:05.930
So Cervantes,
as with the picaresque--

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.349
and we're going to discuss it
in the following discussion of

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:12.800
the galley slaves episode--
Cervantes is concerned that the

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.748
conventions of literature,
its topics, draw it away from

00:34:16.748 --> 00:34:17.639
real life.
 

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:22.045
That even the new genres,
new in relation to the

00:34:22.045 --> 00:34:25.250
classics,
reassert their literariness by

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:29.730
deploying these conventions,
which turn into predictable

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.530
systems.
 

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:35.007
Awareness of this possibility
is crucial to the whole Quixote

00:34:35.007 --> 00:34:40.054
and to Cervantes's entire work;
how convention obscures the

00:34:40.054 --> 00:34:46.123
real and shields us from it;
how literature quickly retreats

00:34:46.123 --> 00:34:51.119
to formulas, like those in Don
Quixote's mind.

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:55.958
Self reflexivity helps to point
out these conventions and to

00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:59.239
show their disconnection from
reality;

00:34:59.239 --> 00:35:01.920
they are being self generated
and self contained--

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.675
I am reminded here,
I don't know if you've seen

00:35:04.675 --> 00:35:07.429
The Kiss of the Spider
Woman,

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:11.574
but it's a great movie,
and you remember that Molina is

00:35:11.574 --> 00:35:16.101
telling his cell mate all of
these movies that he has in his

00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:17.923
head,
that he has memorized,

00:35:17.923 --> 00:35:20.608
and there are people who have
memorized the plots of many

00:35:20.608 --> 00:35:23.579
movies and can condense them
into kind of a generic movie,

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:28.844
the way Don Quixote is creating
here a kind of generic chivalric

00:35:28.844 --> 00:35:29.679
romance.
 

00:35:29.679 --> 00:35:33.498
This also plays into the game
of mirrors that the

00:35:33.498 --> 00:35:38.041
Quixote is becoming,
it is a story within the story,

00:35:38.041 --> 00:35:42.760
and the large story is a parody
of a romance of chivalry.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.135
It is, this,
what is called in French

00:35:46.135 --> 00:35:50.824
'composition en
abÃ®me,' and in English

00:35:50.824 --> 00:35:55.139
it's 'the infinitely receding
sequences',

00:35:55.139 --> 00:35:57.226
that we found in
VelÃ¡zquez,

00:35:57.226 --> 00:36:00.389
Las Meninas,
the story within the story,

00:36:00.389 --> 00:36:01.340
like the painting within the
painting,

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.010
like the play within the play,
in Hamlet.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:10.405
I first visualized this as a
child looking at the label on a

00:36:10.405 --> 00:36:14.599
condensed milk can,
and the label depicted a

00:36:14.599 --> 00:36:17.690
condensed milk can with the same
label,

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:22.351
within which there was another
label with the same condensed

00:36:22.351 --> 00:36:24.748
milk can,
and so forth and so on,

00:36:24.748 --> 00:36:28.463
and I had the vertigo of not
knowing whether I was part of a

00:36:28.463 --> 00:36:31.739
larger condensed milk can or
some such depiction.

00:36:31.739 --> 00:36:36.050
Guys, they don't go to
barbershops any more,

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.389
I don't think,
it doesn't look like it to me,

00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:42.836
but some of you do,
but little boys discovered this

00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:44.349
in barbershops.
 

00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:48.085
When you sat in the barber's
chair and you were surrounded by

00:36:48.085 --> 00:36:50.844
mirrors,
and suddenly you see yourself,

00:36:50.844 --> 00:36:52.768
wow!,
you get lost in an infinity of

00:36:52.768 --> 00:36:53.969
reflections of yourself.
 

00:36:53.969 --> 00:36:58.329
That is an infinitely receding
sequence.

00:36:58.329 --> 00:37:01.250
That is there is no without,
if you are within that,

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:02.969
there is no without,
you're always--

00:37:02.969 --> 00:37:05.610
Everything is within
literature, hence,

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:09.940
there is no authority that
orders the universe of fiction,

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.619
which is continuous with that
of reality.

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:16.090
The only infinite being would
be God,

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:20.840
so to posit this kind of abyss
like universe is a form of

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:24.829
radical skepticism on the part
of Cervantes,

00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:26.239
and of Shakespeare, by the way.
 

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:29.793
Here the authority within that
fiction, this house of

00:37:29.793 --> 00:37:33.960
mirrors--I'm sure you've also
gone to the house of mirrors--is

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:34.849
a madman.
 

00:37:34.849 --> 00:37:40.018
Don Quixote as within the
picaresque--and we will get to

00:37:40.018 --> 00:37:44.250
that--it will be GinÃ©s de
Pasamonte.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:49.596
Another important point about
this generic chivalric romance

00:37:49.596 --> 00:37:53.130
that Don Quixote comes up with
here,

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:57.304
in answer to Sancho's question,
is that Don Quixote reveals his

00:37:57.304 --> 00:37:59.190
worries about his lineage.
 

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:04.980
He has to acquire fame to
aspire to marry a princess.

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:08.094
Behind this apparently
naÃ¯ve preoccupation lays

00:38:08.094 --> 00:38:11.150
one of the social issues at
stake in the novel,

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.219
the question of social class
and privilege,

00:38:14.219 --> 00:38:16.920
and the possibility of
acquiring it,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.210
rather than inheriting it.
 

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:25.389
You remember that he speaks
here about...

00:38:25.389 --> 00:38:30.710
He will acquire enough fame by
dint of his own valor to merit

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:33.369
being married to a princess.
 

00:38:33.369 --> 00:38:37.376
Even in the relationship within
the knight and his squire,

00:38:37.376 --> 00:38:41.456
there are intimations of a
leveling of social classes here,

00:38:41.456 --> 00:38:42.300
in this.
 

00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:44.744
And you will see,
as we move to Part II,

00:38:44.744 --> 00:38:48.382
that this will increase as
Sancho's importance in the novel

00:38:48.382 --> 00:38:49.260
increases.
 

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.657
So this is one of the topics,
but here we get another glimpse

00:38:52.657 --> 00:38:54.469
at Don Quixote's subconscious.
 

00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:59.302
He is worried about his lack of
nobility, his lack of

00:38:59.302 --> 00:39:01.719
aristocratic background.
 

00:39:01.719 --> 00:39:06.860
Now, we get to the galley
slaves, which is,

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:13.469
again, another famous episode
in the Quixote.

00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:16.965
This is chapter XXII,
Part I, because it also shows

00:39:16.965 --> 00:39:20.391
Cervantes dealing with the
question of literature,

00:39:20.391 --> 00:39:22.980
more specifically the
picaresque.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:28.449
Notice, by the way,
in this chapter,

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:33.853
the mistranslation when Jarvis
renders 'alcahuete' as

00:39:33.853 --> 00:39:38.264
'pimp,' on page 166,
when it should be 'go-between,'

00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:41.610
the galley slave who has been a
go-between--

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.190
remember?--that Don Quixote
actually praises,

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:50.268
and in the original it says
alcahuete.

00:39:50.268 --> 00:39:53.275
Alcahuete is someone who
arranges marriages and illicit

00:39:53.275 --> 00:39:56.380
encounters between lovers and
all of that, but is not a pimp.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:00.610
A pimp is an agent for
prostitutes.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:06.030
Alcahuetes or
go-betweens have been praised

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.898
throughout the ages,
even by Saint Augustine,

00:40:10.898 --> 00:40:16.731
at some point;
he praises the job that they do

00:40:16.731 --> 00:40:22.434
in arranging couples to meet and
become lovers,

00:40:22.434 --> 00:40:27.268
just a detail about the
translation.

00:40:27.268 --> 00:40:31.565
I don't want to belabor the
failings of the translation,

00:40:31.565 --> 00:40:33.829
which is a pretty good one.
 

00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:37.550
Now, again, why the picaresque?
 

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:41.199
You might be getting tired of
my talking about the picaresque,

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:44.737
but the picaresque is the new
fiction that precedes the

00:40:44.737 --> 00:40:49.621
Quixote,
precedes Cervantes' work within

00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:54.340
which, and against which,
he writes.

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.166
The picaresque comes up again,
not only because like the

00:40:59.166 --> 00:41:02.809
pÃ­caro,
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte,

00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:07.860
who is the main character here,
is a criminal,

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.510
but more importantly because
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte is an

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:13.219
author.
 

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:21.210
When asked if his book is good
by Don Quixote,

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:24.853
GinÃ©s replies--I'm on
page 169: "'So good,'

00:41:24.853 --> 00:41:28.322
answered GinÃ©s,
'that woe be to Lazarillo de

00:41:28.322 --> 00:41:31.074
Tormes,
and to all that have written or

00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:35.809
shall write in that way.'"
And when asked for the title

00:41:35.809 --> 00:41:38.992
and if it is finished,
GinÃ©s answers,

00:41:38.992 --> 00:41:41.213
quote: 'It's called The Life
of GinÃ©s de

00:41:41.213 --> 00:41:43.389
Pasamonte,' replied
GinÃ©s himself.

00:41:43.389 --> 00:41:46.210
'And is it finished?' quoth Don
Quixote.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:47.257
'How can it be finished?'
 

00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:49.309
answered he, 'since my life is
not yet finished?

00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:52.643
what is written,
is from my cradle to the moment

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:57.039
of my being this sent this last
time to the galleys.'"

00:41:57.039 --> 00:42:01.280
Picaresque novels tended to be
called "Vida

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.739
de...,"
life of...

00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:05.510
Vida de Lazarillo de
Tormes, Vida de

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.809
GuzmÃ¡n de Alfarache.
 

00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:09.771
So The Life of GinÃ©s
de Pasamonte is obviously a

00:42:09.771 --> 00:42:12.590
picaresque kind novel that he
has written about himself.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:16.579
So Cervantes is talking from
here at the conventions of

00:42:16.579 --> 00:42:20.112
autobiographical writing,
meaning, "how can you

00:42:20.112 --> 00:42:23.320
write an autobiography if your
life is not over?",

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.679
is what GinÃ©s answers,
and Cervantes is poking fun at

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.007
that,
so, which leads,

00:42:30.007 --> 00:42:33.784
in autobiographical writing--
as in the Confessions of

00:42:33.784 --> 00:42:37.931
Saint Augustine and so forth--
to the creation of a death and

00:42:37.931 --> 00:42:40.119
resurrection kind of scheme.
 

00:42:40.119 --> 00:42:43.536
That is, I am speaking about
the man that I formerly was

00:42:43.536 --> 00:42:46.893
until I had a conversion,
by which the old man died and

00:42:46.893 --> 00:42:49.130
the new one arose,
and so forth.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:52.679
So this is what is behind this
little repartee here,

00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:55.210
between GinÃ©s de
Pasamonte and Don Quixote,

00:42:55.210 --> 00:43:00.695
which is a satire of
autobiographical writing and of

00:43:00.695 --> 00:43:04.570
the picaresque novel
specifically.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:09.561
Here GinÃ©s underscores
the fact that there is no way to

00:43:09.561 --> 00:43:13.512
put a stop to it,
by saying that to the last time

00:43:13.512 --> 00:43:16.786
he went to the galleys,
so every time he went to the

00:43:16.786 --> 00:43:19.349
galleys he takes up the book
again and writes it,

00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:20.199
and writes it,
and writes it,

00:43:20.199 --> 00:43:21.958
and he says at one point here
that he doesn't mind going to

00:43:21.958 --> 00:43:23.900
the galleys because there he'll
be able to finish his book,

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.193
so there is a kind of literal
continuity between life and

00:43:27.193 --> 00:43:30.467
writing,
that is what is being made fun

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.219
of in this episode.
 

00:43:32.219 --> 00:43:36.300
Now, you remember the whole
background of the picaresque,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.650
because I've given it to you
many times,

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.168
from the Celestina to
GuzmÃ¡n de

00:43:41.168 --> 00:43:43.340
Alfarache,
1599, right?

00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:46.369
At the time Cervantes was
writing Don Quixote,

00:43:46.369 --> 00:43:49.163
and in the GuzmÃ¡n de
Alfarache the protagonist is

00:43:49.163 --> 00:43:51.684
a galley slave at one point,
so the allusion to the

00:43:51.684 --> 00:43:54.190
GuzmÃ¡n de
Alfarache is very clear.

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:57.730
Now, GinÃ©s de Pasamonte
is one of the most important

00:43:57.730 --> 00:44:00.599
secondary characters in the
Quixote --

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:06.369
This is not an oxymoron,
of secondary and important.

00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:08.559
There are important secondary
characters,

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:10.630
and secondary characters that
are not important--

00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:14.139
not only because it's really
fun and funny--

00:44:14.139 --> 00:44:16.440
he's really a lot of fun,
and he will reappear--

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.719
but because he's one of the
storytellers in the book,

00:44:20.719 --> 00:44:24.505
hence it's part of the book's
take on literature and the

00:44:24.505 --> 00:44:26.018
nature of narrative.
 

00:44:26.018 --> 00:44:29.389
GinÃ©s is one of the many
storytellers in the

00:44:29.389 --> 00:44:30.280
Quixote.
 

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.958
By this I mean characters who
not only tell a story or recite

00:44:33.958 --> 00:44:37.210
a poem, but who are writing or
have written a book.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:42.809
The most memorable of these
are, of course,

00:44:42.809 --> 00:44:44.210
the narrator of the
Quixote,

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.507
who claims not to be the
author, the apocryphal Cide

00:44:47.507 --> 00:44:50.500
Hamete Benengeli,
the translator, and so forth;

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.010
these are all characters who
have written a book.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.820
There will be others;
Cardenio has written a book.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:59.628
Cervantes is considering with
them the possibility of new

00:44:59.628 --> 00:45:02.052
genres,
new forms of literature

00:45:02.052 --> 00:45:05.760
emerging--which they are,
at the time that he is

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.913
writing--and showing the
mechanisms by which a new genre

00:45:09.913 --> 00:45:11.429
is born,
a new genre,

00:45:11.429 --> 00:45:13.967
meaning a new kind of
literature that is not merely

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:16.000
derived or copied from the
classics,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.550
as was done or attempted to be
done in the Renaissance.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:24.750
These are authors,
like Lope de Vega,

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.420
whose name I've mentioned many
times,

00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.057
and I'm not going to put it on
the board because you must

00:45:28.057 --> 00:45:29.601
remember,
who created,

00:45:29.601 --> 00:45:32.980
as it were, the Spanish
theater,

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.829
national theater,
the comedia.

00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:40.146
And so, GinÃ©s is as
complex a figure as other

00:45:40.146 --> 00:45:46.610
narrators of the Quixote
like Cide Hamete Benengeli,

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:50.103
and I remind you again,
and I'll do it probably again

00:45:50.103 --> 00:45:52.534
in this lecture,
that at this point between the

00:45:52.534 --> 00:45:54.150
sixteenth and the seventeenth
centuries,

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:56.780
the first professional authors
are emerging,

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:59.739
that is, authors who are trying
to make a living from their

00:45:59.739 --> 00:46:00.250
writing.
 

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:02.731
Lope did, very,
very well, because,

00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:06.528
of course, he wrote so many
plays and he did so well,

00:46:06.528 --> 00:46:10.179
while Cervantes didn't do so
well, as we know.

00:46:10.179 --> 00:46:15.768
 
 

00:46:15.768 --> 00:46:18.596
Now, this interest in the
nature of literature and the

00:46:18.596 --> 00:46:21.583
figure of the author in the
Quixote is because the

00:46:21.583 --> 00:46:24.211
novel,
this novel, the Quixote,

00:46:24.211 --> 00:46:27.704
is not so much about the
question of the book as it is

00:46:27.704 --> 00:46:30.764
about that of the books,
in the plural,

00:46:30.764 --> 00:46:35.710
as we saw in the episode of the
scrutiny of the library.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:40.063
It is about the proliferation
of books made possible by the

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:44.340
development of the printing
press and the economic factors

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.168
that encourage editorial
production in the sixteenth

00:46:48.168 --> 00:46:49.219
century.
 

00:46:49.219 --> 00:46:53.918
The Quixote is the first
major work to consider how the

00:46:53.918 --> 00:46:58.773
dissemination of books unsettles
received notions about the book

00:46:58.773 --> 00:47:00.699
and about authorship.
 

00:47:00.699 --> 00:47:07.079
These are, remember,
again, turn of the century,

00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:08.920
sixteenth to the seventeenth,
new genres,

00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.248
new authors,
like Mateo AlemÃ¡n and

00:47:11.248 --> 00:47:13.059
Lope de Vega,
who are professionals,

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:14.762
and so forth;
this is tied to the whole issue

00:47:14.762 --> 00:47:15.280
of the books.
 

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.846
Now, I'm going to go into a
part of the lecture here that

00:47:19.846 --> 00:47:24.043
might get a little dense,
because it's about this

00:47:24.043 --> 00:47:28.619
proliferation of books in
relation to the author and the

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:30.699
veracity of the books.
 

00:47:30.699 --> 00:47:33.737
I'll go very slowly,
because I, myself,

00:47:33.737 --> 00:47:38.132
feel that it is a bit dense,
and I don't want to confuse

00:47:38.132 --> 00:47:42.369
you, and if I do,
you raise your hand in protest.

00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:49.829
The proliferation of books is
accompanied by a decline in the

00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:56.420
social class of authors and of
the author figures,

00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.429
by which I mean characters like
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte,

00:48:01.429 --> 00:48:03.599
who represent authors within
the fiction--

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:04.530
Now, take stock of this.
 

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:08.135
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte is a
criminal, is a prisoner,

00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:11.739
he's a galley slave,
however, he has written a book.

00:48:11.739 --> 00:48:14.914
This is novel,
I mean, that someone of his

00:48:14.914 --> 00:48:17.315
social class,
couldn't be lower,

00:48:17.315 --> 00:48:19.018
is writing a book.
 

00:48:19.018 --> 00:48:22.596
So, just as the production of
many copies of a single book

00:48:22.596 --> 00:48:25.860
brings down the fetish value of
each single copy--

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.579
as happens with everything,
if you have too many of

00:48:28.579 --> 00:48:33.114
something the value declines,
if you have very few the value

00:48:33.114 --> 00:48:34.139
increases.
 

00:48:34.139 --> 00:48:37.409
I have a two-dollar bill in my
wallet somebody gave me,

00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:39.099
and I've kept it because they
say it is good luck,

00:48:39.099 --> 00:48:40.849
but also because there are few
of those,

00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:45.449
so this is the fetish value of
things that are few;

00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:51.157
this we've learned in economic
classes since we were going to

00:48:51.157 --> 00:48:52.489
high school.
 

00:48:52.489 --> 00:48:57.019
But the opposite is true of the
authors and author figures

00:48:57.019 --> 00:49:01.628
relevance, which increases as
the value of each copy of his

00:49:01.628 --> 00:49:03.139
book decreases.
 

00:49:03.139 --> 00:49:08.134
The authors now become the
guarantee of the work's worth,

00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:13.039
as well as the one accountable
for it before the law.

00:49:13.039 --> 00:49:15.795
In the case of the
comedia,

00:49:15.795 --> 00:49:20.583
the Spanish plays,
where proliferation was rampant

00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:25.023
to be 'de Lope,' by Lope,
became a sign of

00:49:25.023 --> 00:49:29.992
excellence--like a trademark--
applicable as an indication of

00:49:29.992 --> 00:49:33.179
value to things other than
plays.

00:49:33.179 --> 00:49:34.994
You could say,
this thing is de Lope,

00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:36.860
and it meant that it was very
good.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:41.393
In the picaresque,
author and protagonists are

00:49:41.393 --> 00:49:45.463
conflated into one,
book and author become one as

00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:48.782
in the case of GinÃ©s,
whose reductio ad

00:49:48.782 --> 00:49:52.708
absurdum of this textual
strategy has been noted many

00:49:52.708 --> 00:49:54.800
times--
the one that we've just seen.

00:49:54.800 --> 00:50:01.280
A rudimentary equation could
perhaps be worked out.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.405
These new authors break with
the strictures of renaissance

00:50:04.405 --> 00:50:06.635
mimesis--
the idea of imitating the

00:50:06.635 --> 00:50:09.932
classics--
in the sense then they innovate

00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:13.599
leaving behind classical forms
and themes,

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:17.500
or subjecting them to
substantial transformations.

00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.800
They are no longer like the
classics;

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.268
they are subjecting them to
transformations.

00:50:22.268 --> 00:50:26.400
Hence, the dissent in social
status of the author appears to

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.809
be accompanied by an increase in
inventiveness and a rise in the

00:50:30.809 --> 00:50:34.460
importance of the author--
is that clear?

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.380
It should be clear, no?
 

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:40.320
The higher the social class,
the less the invention,

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.030
because they follow mimesis;
they imitate the classics.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:49.679
The lower the author's social
class,

00:50:49.679 --> 00:50:53.404
the greater the invention,
hence more value attached to

00:50:53.404 --> 00:50:56.190
the author,
which leads to the following:

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.047
the more invention,
the more value given to the

00:50:59.047 --> 00:51:01.300
author--
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte who

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.780
prides himself of having written
this book about himself.

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:11.000
This explains why,
as AlemÃ¡n did before

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.360
with his GuzmÃ¡n de
Alfarache,

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:21.670
Cervantes rushes to write his
second part,

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:23.820
once he learns that Avellaneda
has written a second part of

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:24.599
the Quixote.
 

00:51:24.599 --> 00:51:29.572
He feels that the
Quixote is his invention,

00:51:29.572 --> 00:51:34.750
his in every sense,
including the monetary sense;

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:40.896
that he's going to lose
revenues if somebody else writes

00:51:40.896 --> 00:51:43.018
a Quixote.
 

00:51:43.018 --> 00:51:47.541
So it seems that the impact of
these socioeconomic developments

00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:50.239
on books and authors is
undeniable.

00:51:50.239 --> 00:51:54.286
But there is another important
factor at work that issues from

00:51:54.286 --> 00:51:57.804
the content of the book
themselves and its relation to

00:51:57.804 --> 00:52:01.101
knowledge--
I hope that you have made that

00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:01.639
clear.
 

00:52:01.639 --> 00:52:04.762
This is clear;
and GinÃ©s de Pasamonte

00:52:04.762 --> 00:52:06.809
exemplifies the lowering of
social class.

00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:10.784
Cervantes, himself,
was a very petty nobleman,

00:52:10.784 --> 00:52:14.630
poor, and so forth;
so GinÃ©s de Pasamonte is

00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:18.742
important because he exemplifies
that drop in social class of the

00:52:18.742 --> 00:52:21.572
author--
Now, Anthony Grafton opens the

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:24.969
introduction to his magnificent
New Worlds,

00:52:24.969 --> 00:52:27.619
Ancient Texts:
the Power of Tradition and the

00:52:27.619 --> 00:52:30.210
Shock of Discovery with
these words--

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:32.809
Grafton is a professor at
Princeton University--

00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:35.525
the book is called New
Worlds, Ancient Texts:

00:52:35.525 --> 00:52:38.820
the Power of Tradition and the
Shock of Discovery,

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:41.239
and the quote is the
following--it's a very important

00:52:41.239 --> 00:52:43.489
quote,
I want you to follow it

00:52:43.489 --> 00:52:48.262
closely: "Between 1550 and
1650 [it encompasses just the

00:52:48.262 --> 00:52:51.764
time of Cervantes]
Western thinkers ceased to

00:52:51.764 --> 00:52:56.458
believe that they could find all
important truths in ancient

00:52:56.458 --> 00:52:57.969
books."
 

00:52:57.969 --> 00:53:00.505
So whereas the early
Renaissance thought that

00:53:00.505 --> 00:53:03.043
all-important truths could be
found in books,

00:53:03.043 --> 00:53:04.599
now this has decreased.
 

00:53:04.599 --> 00:53:10.239
Grafton goes on to quote Jesuit
JosÃ© de Acosta--

00:53:10.239 --> 00:53:17.789
a very common name in Spanish,
JosÃ© de Acosta--

00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:24.119
who wrote in his--this is a
book about the history of the

00:53:24.119 --> 00:53:26.789
new world--
called Historia natural y

00:53:26.789 --> 00:53:27.860
moral de las Indias.
 

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:31.996
This is Acosta quoted by
Grafton: "Having read that

00:53:31.996 --> 00:53:36.210
what poets and philosophers
write of the Torrid Zone,

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:40.402
I persuaded myself that when I
came to the equator [he was

00:53:40.402 --> 00:53:44.521
traveling to the New World]
I would not be able to endure

00:53:44.521 --> 00:53:47.967
the violent heat,
but it turned out otherwise,

00:53:47.967 --> 00:53:51.952
for when I passed the equator I
felt so cold that I was forced

00:53:51.952 --> 00:53:54.369
to go into the sun to warm
myself.

00:53:54.369 --> 00:53:57.545
What could I do then but laugh
at Aristotle's

00:53:57.545 --> 00:53:58.844
meteorology?"
 

00:53:58.844 --> 00:53:59.639
Unquote.
 

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:02.878
Ironically, then,
the proliferation of books

00:54:02.878 --> 00:54:07.173
begins at the time when the
authority of the book was most

00:54:07.173 --> 00:54:10.489
severely tested and ultimately
devalued.

00:54:10.489 --> 00:54:14.887
The ability to read many books
did not bring one closer to the

00:54:14.887 --> 00:54:18.807
truth but to an inordinate,
perhaps, infinite enlargement

00:54:18.807 --> 00:54:21.748
of the library,
and to Don Quixote's madness,

00:54:21.748 --> 00:54:25.500
or to Descartes "Je
pense, donc je suis,"

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.250
I think,
therefore I am,

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.809
I only know that I am because I
think,

00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:33.134
and in this way he discards the
whole philosophical traditional

00:54:33.134 --> 00:54:34.260
in books before it.
 

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:37.293
This, too, leads in the
direction of an increase in the

00:54:37.293 --> 00:54:38.809
importance of the author.
 

00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:42.436
Just as the classical tradition
is being refashioned or denied

00:54:42.436 --> 00:54:45.764
altogether, so it's received
knowledge from the canonical

00:54:45.764 --> 00:54:47.369
books being questioned.
 

00:54:47.369 --> 00:54:50.818
The function of books changes
not only because the printing

00:54:50.818 --> 00:54:53.849
press makes them available in
larger quantities,

00:54:53.849 --> 00:54:57.199
but also because they are no
longer seen as reliable

00:54:57.199 --> 00:54:58.579
purveyors of truth.
 

00:54:58.579 --> 00:55:02.777
Experience becomes a very
important element in thinking in

00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:05.650
philosophy and literature,
not books.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:09.980
If Acosta in the 1590s can
laugh at Aristotle,

00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.860
why not pick up then a
picaresque novel and have a good

00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:15.221
laugh,
or a chivalric romance and be

00:55:15.221 --> 00:55:17.282
entertained,
or aroused instead?,

00:55:17.282 --> 00:55:19.880
or the Quixote, and have
a good time?

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:22.719
Reading book times is not
equated as before with the

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:26.228
acquisition of knowledge,
but increasingly with pleasure,

00:55:26.228 --> 00:55:29.621
and the value of each book is
dependent an author whose

00:55:29.621 --> 00:55:32.449
ability to produce such pleasure
is known.

00:55:32.449 --> 00:55:37.797
The scrutiny of the library and
Altisidora's dream clearly show

00:55:37.797 --> 00:55:42.800
some of the quandaries that this
new situation opens up.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.840
Altisidora's dream is this
marvelous episode in Part II,

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:49.710
when a character--you will meet
her--

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:51.739
named Altisidora,
has a dream,

00:55:51.739 --> 00:55:54.820
in which sees some devils
playing tennis,

00:55:54.820 --> 00:56:00.405
and the balls are books,
and the rackets are flaming

00:56:00.405 --> 00:56:02.806
rackets,
and when they hit the books,

00:56:02.806 --> 00:56:04.974
the books,
poof!, explode,

00:56:04.974 --> 00:56:07.179
and are pulverized.
 

00:56:07.179 --> 00:56:11.288
It's a magnificent dream about
what I'm telling you about,

00:56:11.288 --> 00:56:13.090
and you will get to it.
 

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:16.375
Of course, the book that is
pulverized most easily is

00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:19.030
Avellaneda's apocryphal
Quixote,

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:26.501
as Cervantes takes advantage of
this episode to pocke fun at his

00:56:26.501 --> 00:56:27.449
rival.
 

00:56:27.449 --> 00:56:37.119
So this is why GinÃ©s de
Pasamonte is so important.

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:40.806
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte,
who now appears--and I don't

00:56:40.806 --> 00:56:44.561
have the quote here but I'm sure
you remember--how he is

00:56:44.561 --> 00:56:45.449
shackled.
 

00:56:45.449 --> 00:56:48.476
He is covered with chains from
head to foot,

00:56:48.476 --> 00:56:51.784
he cannot move his head down to
reach his hands,

00:56:51.784 --> 00:56:54.530
nor have his hands reach his
mouth.

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:58.554
It is as if he were possessed
of some demonic power;

00:56:58.554 --> 00:56:59.739
slipperiness.
 

00:56:59.739 --> 00:57:05.655
Here Cervantes is anticipating
kind of a romantic notion of the

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:10.902
author as a demonic figure,
but the most interesting thing

00:57:10.902 --> 00:57:14.635
is that GinÃ©s de
Pasamonte is also a self

00:57:14.635 --> 00:57:18.648
portrait of Cervantes,
because at one point

00:57:18.648 --> 00:57:24.400
GinÃ©s describes himself
as being very unfortunate,

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.791
and the line is obviously a
self allusive line on the part

00:57:29.791 --> 00:57:31.210
of Cervantes.
 

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:37.972
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte is a
figure of Cervantes in the book:

00:57:37.972 --> 00:57:42.094
lower class,
and also this inventiveness

00:57:42.094 --> 00:57:47.614
that has to be contained by all
of these chains that hold him

00:57:47.614 --> 00:57:48.349
down.
 

00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:52.733
In Part II he will reappear,
and I can anticipate having a

00:57:52.733 --> 00:57:57.268
lot of fun with GinÃ©s
when he appears in Part II,

00:57:57.268 --> 00:58:00.715
and he is a master puppeteer,
he has a puppet theater and I

00:58:00.715 --> 00:58:04.219
will not ruin the plot by
telling you what happens then,

00:58:04.219 --> 00:58:08.675
but it's hilarious and it
dovetails what I have been

00:58:08.675 --> 00:58:10.860
telling you about here.
 

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:17.106
Now, so this slipperiness in
the part of this author figure

00:58:17.106 --> 00:58:22.599
is connected to all of these
games of authorship.

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:27.072
The slipperiness of Cide Hamete
Benengeli, the slipperiness of

00:58:27.072 --> 00:58:31.619
the translator who has the text
translated, and all of that.

00:58:31.619 --> 00:58:36.157
They are all contained within
this figure of GinÃ©s de

00:58:36.157 --> 00:58:38.619
Pasamonte, this pÃ­caro.
 

00:58:38.619 --> 00:58:43.688
But there is one more aspect of
GinÃ©s that I want to

00:58:43.688 --> 00:58:46.550
discuss,
and that is contained in an

00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:49.856
essay that you have in the
Casebook about

00:58:49.856 --> 00:58:54.208
GinÃ©s being cross-eyed,
and I am going to simply

00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:58.699
summarize it because we're
coming to the end of the hour

00:58:58.699 --> 00:59:04.090
and I direct you to that essay
of mine if you want the details.

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.190
You remember that when
GinÃ©s is introduced it is

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:10.634
said: "Behind all of this
came a man of some 30 years of

00:59:10.634 --> 00:59:14.135
age of a goodly aspect except he
seemed to thrust one eye into

00:59:14.135 --> 00:59:15.400
the other."
 

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.510
What he means is that
GinÃ©s is cross-eyed--

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:21.893
"metÃ­a un ojo en
el otro,"

00:59:21.893 --> 00:59:23.159
we still say in Spanish.
 

00:59:23.159 --> 00:59:25.211
Now, vision,
of course, is tied to

00:59:25.211 --> 00:59:26.268
representation.
 

00:59:26.268 --> 00:59:29.259
You represent what you see,
and GinÃ©s,

00:59:29.259 --> 00:59:33.539
being an author-figure who is
cross-eyed, is very suggestive.

00:59:33.539 --> 00:59:39.362
First of all,
because being cross-eyed gives

00:59:39.362 --> 00:59:43.289
GinÃ©s a shifty look.
 

00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:46.751
When you say,
but you look at somebody in the

00:59:46.751 --> 00:59:49.820
eye to see if they're being
sincere,

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.885
if there is something in the
eye, still doesn't have to be

00:59:52.885 --> 00:59:56.163
cross-eyed,
then the person doesn't appear

00:59:56.163 --> 00:59:56.920
sincere.
 

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:01.773
So being cross-eyed gives
GinÃ©s a shifty appearance

01:00:01.773 --> 01:00:04.329
going with his slipperiness.
 

01:00:04.329 --> 01:00:07.789
Also, he's Janus-like,
that if you look at him from

01:00:07.789 --> 01:00:09.556
one side,
you see one this way,

01:00:09.556 --> 01:00:11.340
if you look at it from the
other side,

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:14.496
the eye is going the other way,
so he's two things at the same

01:00:14.496 --> 01:00:16.288
time,
whether you look at him from

01:00:16.288 --> 01:00:19.061
one side or the other,
so there is no center,

01:00:19.061 --> 01:00:22.244
no stable figure of
GinÃ©s de Pasamonte

01:00:22.244 --> 01:00:24.268
because he is cross-eyed.
 

01:00:24.268 --> 01:00:27.981
He has a monocular
cross-eyedness,

01:00:27.981 --> 01:00:33.719
that is, one is the one that
goes into the other.

01:00:33.719 --> 01:00:38.065
So therefore,
if you have two lines of site

01:00:38.065 --> 01:00:41.563
that normally meet here,
in this object,

01:00:41.563 --> 01:00:43.960
and that object is represented
to your mind well,

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.960
if you are cross-eyed they meet
here,

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.000
and therefore,
the object is distorted.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.510
This is what monocular
cross-eyedness means.

01:00:54.510 --> 01:01:00.346
Also, it leads to a double
vision, what is called

01:01:00.346 --> 01:01:04.480
diplopia--Sorry for this.
 

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:11.059
 
 

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:14.365
So GinÃ©s suffers from
this cross-eyedness,

01:01:14.365 --> 01:01:17.190
diplopia,
meaning double vision;

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.469
he sees two things at the same
time.

01:01:19.469 --> 01:01:24.969
And he is this figure of the
author,

01:01:24.969 --> 01:01:28.911
the figure of the author who,
like the Cervantes of the first

01:01:28.911 --> 01:01:31.166
prologue,
who has to divide himself in

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:34.476
two persons,
is two within his own vision,

01:01:34.476 --> 01:01:36.610
because he sees double.
 

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:40.230
What I'm trying to say is this.
 

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:44.882
You will see that one of the
topics in the Quixote

01:01:44.882 --> 01:01:49.202
criticism is perspectivism,
that reality is seen from

01:01:49.202 --> 01:01:51.280
various perspectives.
 

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.800
The perspective of each one of
the characters,

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.679
and that supposedly reality,
in the end of some of these

01:01:57.679 --> 01:02:00.282
hilarious discussions,
in the end, is the sum total of

01:02:00.282 --> 01:02:01.409
all of these perspectives.
 

01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:06.610
What I'm trying to say is that
there is no such thing,

01:02:06.610 --> 01:02:09.731
that within each individual
there is already perspectivism

01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:12.360
because there is more than one
view of things.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.719
I want to emphasize this.
 

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:18.038
GinÃ©s sees two things;
he's not just simply one

01:02:18.038 --> 01:02:18.719
perspective.
 

01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:23.768
There is perspectivism within
him, not just from all of the

01:02:23.768 --> 01:02:25.768
others' perspectives.
 

01:02:25.768 --> 01:02:28.929
This complicates the issue a
lot more,

01:02:28.929 --> 01:02:33.213
particularly,
when you take into account that

01:02:33.213 --> 01:02:37.010
he is presented as an author
figure,

01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:39.639
as a storyteller in the
Quixote.

01:02:39.639 --> 01:02:44.311
Storytellers in the
Quixote tend not to be very

01:02:44.311 --> 01:02:49.425
healthy, either physically or
mentally, and GinÃ©s is

01:02:49.425 --> 01:02:52.070
important because of that.
 

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:53.690
So we're going to leave it at
that,

01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:57.827
and in the next class we're
going to about another one of

01:02:57.827 --> 01:03:02.217
these galley slaves in passing,
the one that I have called in

01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:07.280
my book Love and the Law,
'the prisoner of sex,' and this

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:10.717
is the minor character,
this is a really minor,

01:03:10.717 --> 01:03:12.840
minor character--
one paragraph.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.989
If you go back to this episode
of the galley slave in XXII,

01:03:15.989 --> 01:03:19.489
the guy who is carrying on with
four women at the same time,

01:03:19.489 --> 01:03:22.349
two of whom were cousins of his.
 

01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:26.425
So we're going to be talking
about that and other matters

01:03:26.425 --> 01:03:30.572
that are in your syllabus,
but I'll begin by talking about

01:03:30.572 --> 01:03:32.320
the prisoner of sex.
 

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.000

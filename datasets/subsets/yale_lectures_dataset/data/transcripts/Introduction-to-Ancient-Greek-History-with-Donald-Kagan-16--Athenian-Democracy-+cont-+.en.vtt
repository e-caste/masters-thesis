00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.930
Professor Donald
Kagan: I was trying to

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.120
describe to you how the Athenian
democracy in its full form,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.897
after the reforms that were
instituted by Pericles,

00:00:13.897 --> 00:00:19.940
after the death of Ephialtes,
how that system worked and I

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:26.760
had described what we would call
the legislative branch and the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.380
much less significant executive
branch,

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.916
and now I'd like to turn to
what we would call the judicial

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.921
branch.
Now, this Athenian judicial

00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:42.927
system, I think,
might seem even more strange to

00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:47.360
the modern eye than the rest of
the constitution.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.305
You start with this panel of
six 6,000 jurors who enlisted to

00:00:54.305 --> 00:00:59.634
serve in the courts each year.
On any given day,

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:04.604
the jurors who showed up to
accept an assignment were

00:01:04.604 --> 00:01:09.670
assigned to specific courts and
to specific cases.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.364
The usual size of a jury seems
to have been 501,

00:01:15.364 --> 00:01:22.755
although there were juries as
small as fifty-one to as many as

00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:29.904
1,501, depending on what the
case was, whether it was public

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:35.720
or private, and also how
important it was.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.310
To avoid any possibility of
bribery or partiality,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.160
the Athenians evolved an
astonishingly complicated system

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.010
of assignments that effectively
prevented tampering.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.544
That system is described in
Aristotle's Constitution of

00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:55.860
Athens.
I think it's chapter 61;

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.487
if any of you think that you
have about a month or two to

00:01:59.487 --> 00:02:03.438
spare, read that paragraph and
tell me what the hell it means,

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:06.165
how it works.
It's so complicated and the

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:09.958
point is that they wanted to be
sure that it was just impossible

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:13.510
for anybody to know who was
going to be on a particular jury

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.942
panel for a particular case so
that if you wanted to bribe

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:20.374
anybody you'd have to bribe
6,000 people and that might be

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:24.239
mildly discouraging.
You might say that's an honest

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.419
bunch of people.
Well, you don't devise such

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.867
a complicated system if
everybody isn't busily thinking

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:33.229
of a way to cheat,
it seems to me.

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:36.517
However, they would have
failed, the system certainly was

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:40.286
full proof I think.
Legal procedure was remarkably

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:45.360
different from what takes place
in a modern American court.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.662
The first surprise you would
meet is the absence of any

00:02:50.662 --> 00:02:54.590
public prosecutor or state's
attorney.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.080
In fact, there are no lawyers
at all.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.568
Think of that.
Think of how happy that would

00:03:04.568 --> 00:03:08.750
make Shakespeare.
Complaints, whether they were

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.817
civil or criminal,
public or private,

00:03:11.817 --> 00:03:15.565
large or small,
were registered and argued by

00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:19.748
private citizens.
Plaintiff and defendant,

00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:23.884
suer and sued,
each made his case in his own

00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:27.200
voice,
if not in his own language,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.464
because anyone was free to hire
a speech writer to help him

00:03:32.464 --> 00:03:38.000
prepare his case and that
profession flourished in Athens.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.150
Although it reached its peak
only many years after the days

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.014
of Pericles, the greatest
writers of courtroom speeches

00:03:46.014 --> 00:03:49.294
that have been preserved,
and I believe they were

00:03:49.294 --> 00:03:52.435
preserved because generations
thought they were the very best

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:56.176
speeches there were,
come from the next century,

00:03:56.176 --> 00:04:00.390
from the fourth century B.C.
Here's another surprise.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.270
There is no judge.
The jury was everything.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.500
No self respecting Athenian
democrat would allow some

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.110
individual, whatever his
qualifications,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.882
to tell him what was relevant
evidence and what was not,

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:20.699
or which laws or which
precedence applied.

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.232
From the Athenian point of
view, that would give too much

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:26.629
weight to learning and to
expertise,

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:30.546
and it would also create the
danger of corruption and

00:04:30.546 --> 00:04:34.855
undemocratic prejudice.
I mean, if you couldn't conceal

00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:39.160
who the judge was going to be as
you could the jurors,

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.659
you could--if there was a judge
and he was important,

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.833
you might be able to bribe him.
Indeed, in our own system it is

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:51.550
not unheard of that judges are
bribed.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.705
It's not even unheard of that
they were unduly prejudiced in

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:57.603
one direction or another.
The Athenians would have

00:04:57.603 --> 00:05:00.171
none of that.
So, it was up to the

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:04.960
contestants in the case to cite
the relevant laws and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.788
precedence,
and it was up to the jurors to

00:05:08.788 --> 00:05:12.850
decide between the plaintiff and
the defendant.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.887
So, in fundamental matters of
justice and fairness,

00:05:17.887 --> 00:05:23.629
the Athenian democrat put very
little faith in experts.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:27.129
This was one of the most
democratic aspects of this

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.502
democratic constitution,
the assumption that all

00:05:30.502 --> 00:05:34.553
citizens had enough sense and
enough of whatever else it took

00:05:34.553 --> 00:05:38.740
to make the judgments that were
so important in the courts.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.514
In the courtroom,
the plaintiff and defendant

00:05:42.514 --> 00:05:46.459
each had an opportunity to
present his case,

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:51.649
also to rebut his opponent,
to cite what was thought to be

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:55.459
the relevant law,
to produce witnesses,

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:00.607
and then to sum up his case.
Now, here's another amazing

00:06:00.607 --> 00:06:04.208
thing from an American
perspective, each case--I'm

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:07.393
sorry,
each phase in the case was

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:12.924
limited to a specific amount of
time, which was kept by an

00:06:12.924 --> 00:06:18.020
official using a water clock,
and no trial,

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.300
get this, lasted more than a
single day.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.948
Finally, the case went to the
jury, which, of course,

00:06:27.948 --> 00:06:31.526
received no charge or
instruction since there was no

00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:35.384
judge to tell them what they had
to think about and what

00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:40.570
possibilities were available.
The jury did not deliberate;

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:49.156
you didn't have 1,501 angry men.
They just voted by secret

00:06:49.156 --> 00:06:55.350
ballot and a simple majority
decided the issue.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.257
If a penalty was called
for, and it was not one that was

00:07:00.257 --> 00:07:05.579
described by law and very few
penalties were described by law,

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:10.839
the following procedure was
used: the plaintiff who had won

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:15.439
the case proposed a penalty,
the defendant then had the

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.620
opportunity to propose a
different penalty.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.548
The jury then,
again no deliberation,

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:26.104
just voted to choose one or the
other, but they could not

00:07:26.104 --> 00:07:31.436
propose anything of their own;
no creative penalties were

00:07:31.436 --> 00:07:37.260
possible, just one or the other
of the ones proposed by each

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.631
side.
Normally, this process led both

00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:45.709
sides, if you think about it,
to suggest moderate penalties.

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:49.505
For the jury would be put off
by an unreasonable suggestion

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:52.913
one way or another.
If the plaintiff asked for

00:07:52.913 --> 00:07:56.913
too heavy a penalty that would
guarantee they would take the

00:07:56.913 --> 00:07:59.490
other guy's penalty and vice
versa.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.156
Critics of this system
complained that democracy made

00:08:04.156 --> 00:08:08.844
the Athenians litigious.
The system contained a device

00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:12.497
therefore--well,
not therefore but as a matter

00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:16.800
of fact, in contradiction to
that--Let me back up.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.255
Of course, the Athenians were
litigious and knowing that they

00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:25.860
built in an element meant to
reduce the degree of unfounded,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:31.295
unreasonable,
silly, or just terrible

00:08:31.295 --> 00:08:35.834
accusations.
The system contained this

00:08:35.834 --> 00:08:39.259
device.
If the plaintiff did not win a

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:44.735
stated percentage of the jurors'
votes, then he was required to

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:49.388
pay a considerable fine.
In public prosecutions he

00:08:49.388 --> 00:08:53.148
paid it to the state.
In private prosecutions he paid

00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:57.440
it to the defendant.
Surely, this must have served

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.658
as a significant deterrent for
frivolous, malevolent,

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:09.152
and merely adventurous suits.
Just think of how it would

00:09:09.152 --> 00:09:15.340
change our system if we had
something like that.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:18.740
In a way, we do have some of it
available in our system.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.027
It is possible,
for instance,

00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:25.929
if somebody brings a suit
against somebody else and fails,

00:09:25.929 --> 00:09:31.042
it is possible for the judge to
decide that the defeated side

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:35.985
must pay court costs which is a
form of defense against the

00:09:35.985 --> 00:09:39.901
frivolous charges.
But it isn't anything as

00:09:39.901 --> 00:09:45.259
thorough as the Athenian system,
which always had that around.

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:48.360
So, if you had a case that
wasn't going to win many friends

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.460
on the jury it was going to cost
you one way or another.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.187
Well, this Athenian system of
justice had many flaws

00:09:56.187 --> 00:10:00.245
obviously.
Decisions could be quirky and

00:10:00.245 --> 00:10:05.730
unpredictable since they were
unchecked by precedent.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.938
Juries could be prejudiced and
the jurors had no defense except

00:10:09.938 --> 00:10:13.740
their own intelligence and
knowledge against speakers,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.512
who cited laws incorrectly and
who distorted history and we

00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:21.415
have speeches in law courts in
which these guys are making up

00:10:21.415 --> 00:10:24.928
laws that nobody ever heard of
and that they are making

00:10:24.928 --> 00:10:29.494
arguments that are terrible.
So, that they did abuse this

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:33.110
opportunity, there's no question
about it.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.210
Speeches unhampered by rules of
evidence and relevance,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.160
and without the discipline
imposed by judges could be

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.970
fanciful, false,
and sophistical.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.541
There's one anecdote that
is handed down about a famous

00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:51.360
Athenian orator that I think
gives you some clue about this.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.585
This was Lysias,
who lived at the end of the

00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:58.710
fifth century and into the
fourth, and he was one of the

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.159
great successful speech writers
in Athens.

00:11:02.159 --> 00:11:05.745
Well, somebody came to him and
said, "I'm involved in this

00:11:05.745 --> 00:11:09.582
lawsuit Lysias and I'd like to
pay you for writing a speech on

00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:11.990
my side,"
and Lysias said, "fine."

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.863
He went home,
he wrote the speech,

00:11:13.863 --> 00:11:16.759
he brought it to the man,
and said, "here it is."

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:20.900
The guy read it and he said,
"Lysias this is terrific,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.931
great speech,
I can't lose,

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:26.169
thanks a million";
Lysias goes home.

00:11:26.169 --> 00:11:30.003
Little while later Lysias hears
a banging on his door,

00:11:30.003 --> 00:11:33.413
it's the same guy.
He said, "Lysias I read that

00:11:33.413 --> 00:11:35.165
speech again,
was I wrong,

00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:37.899
it's filled with terrible
arguments,

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:41.401
contradictions,
there are holes in your logic

00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:45.539
that they can run trucks
through" and Lysias says,

00:11:45.539 --> 00:11:48.397
"calm down my friend,
the jury will only hear the

00:11:48.397 --> 00:11:49.290
speech once."

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.745
So, of course,
all of these flaws were there,

00:11:58.745 --> 00:12:04.426
yet from a modern perspective I
would argue that the Athenian

00:12:04.426 --> 00:12:08.120
system had a number of
attractions.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:12.875
The American legal system and
court procedures have been

00:12:12.875 --> 00:12:16.593
blamed for excessive
technicality verging on

00:12:16.593 --> 00:12:21.608
incomprehensibility and for the
central role of lawyers and

00:12:21.608 --> 00:12:26.622
judges which give an enormous
advantage to the rich who can

00:12:26.622 --> 00:12:31.551
afford to pay the burgeoning
costs of participating in the

00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:35.808
legal system.
The absence typically of a

00:12:35.808 --> 00:12:40.608
sufficient deterrent to
unfounded lawsuits has helped to

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:44.785
crowd court calendars.
Time spent in jury selection,

00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:48.570
which didn't take any time at
all of course in Athens,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.509
and wrangling over legal
technicalities stretches out

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:57.309
still further,
a process that has no time

00:12:57.309 --> 00:12:59.818
limit.
It is not uncommon for

00:12:59.818 --> 00:13:03.644
participants in a lawsuit to
wait for many years before

00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:07.137
coming to trial.
Sometimes the plaintiff has

00:13:07.137 --> 00:13:10.000
died before his case gets to
court.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.902
Not everyone is convinced
that the gain in the scrupulous

00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:19.478
protection of the participant's
rights in an increasingly

00:13:19.478 --> 00:13:24.789
complex code of legal procedure
is worth the resulting delay,

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:29.575
and some point to the principle
that justice delayed is justice

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:31.982
denied.
Often, in our courts,

00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:36.549
decisions are made by judges on
very remote, difficult,

00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:41.610
legal or procedural grounds
that are incomprehensible to the

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.128
ordinary citizen.
As a result,

00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:47.461
there is much criticism of
judges and lawyers,

00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:51.460
and a loss of faith in general
in the legal system.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.735
For all its flaws,
I think the Athenian system was

00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:00.612
simple, speedy,
open, and very easily

00:14:00.612 --> 00:14:06.384
understood by its citizens.
It did contain provisions aimed

00:14:06.384 --> 00:14:11.097
at producing moderate penalties
and at deterring unreasonable

00:14:11.097 --> 00:14:13.855
lawsuits.
It placed no barriers of

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:17.812
legal technicalities or legal
experts between the citizens and

00:14:17.812 --> 00:14:20.962
their laws,
counting as always on the

00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:24.460
common sense of the ordinary
Athenian.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.769
Now the Athenian democratic
system as a whole,

00:14:27.769 --> 00:14:31.299
brought to its height in the
time of Pericles,

00:14:31.299 --> 00:14:37.857
has been harshly criticized
through the ages immediately by

00:14:37.857 --> 00:14:41.615
contemporaries,
who were hostile to the

00:14:41.615 --> 00:14:45.924
democracy, and through the
centuries by people who have

00:14:45.924 --> 00:14:50.792
looked at Athenian history as it
was depicted by the surviving

00:14:50.792 --> 00:14:55.659
authors and concluded harsh
conclusions about democracy.

00:14:55.659 --> 00:14:59.665
Ancient writers directed most
of their attacks against the

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:03.460
idea of government by mass
meeting and the selection of

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.014
public officials by allotment.
The Athenian renegade

00:15:08.014 --> 00:15:12.431
Alcibiades told a Spartan
audience, as for democracy

00:15:12.431 --> 00:15:18.059
nothing new can be said about
it, an acknowledged foolishness.

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:23.690
Plato has Socrates make the
same point more fully and

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:27.450
seriously.
Socrates observes that when it

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:32.535
is a matter of building a house
or a ship the Athenian assembly

00:15:32.535 --> 00:15:36.568
listens only to experts.
If someone without expert

00:15:36.568 --> 00:15:40.350
qualifications tries to give
advice in such things,

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:44.311
even if he is very handsome and
rich, and noble they refuse to

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:47.698
listen to him.
Instead they laugh and hoot at

00:15:47.698 --> 00:15:52.317
him until either he is shouted
down and withdraws of his own

00:15:52.317 --> 00:15:55.392
accord,
or the sergeants at arms drag

00:15:55.392 --> 00:15:59.740
him off, or he is expelled by
order of the presidents.

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:04.850
So, just imagine that when you
get up to speak in the Athenian

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.620
assembly, you better be ready
for anything.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:12.859
But when the discussion is
about affairs of state says

00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:15.759
Socrates, anyone can get up to
speak,

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:18.767
carpenter, tinker,
cobbler, passenger,

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:22.669
ship owner, rich and poor,
noble and commoner,

00:16:22.669 --> 00:16:27.860
and nobody rebukes him as they
did in the earlier case;

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:32.105
for trying to give advice when
he has no knowledge and has not

00:16:32.105 --> 00:16:36.098
been taught.
Now in fact the Athenians did

00:16:36.098 --> 00:16:40.990
appreciate the importance of
knowledge, skill,

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.393
talent, and experience,
when they thought these things

00:16:45.393 --> 00:16:49.629
existed and could be used in the
public interest.

00:16:49.629 --> 00:16:54.727
So, they did not allot,
but elected military officers,

00:16:54.727 --> 00:16:57.901
some treasurers,
naval architects,

00:16:57.901 --> 00:17:01.460
and managers of the water
supply.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:05.332
These are essentially questions
of life and death,

00:17:05.332 --> 00:17:08.809
or of the financial security of
the state;

00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:13.920
apart from that they did not
care much about expertise.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.579
If they did not elect
professors of political science

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.816
or philosophers,
or lawyers to govern and judge

00:17:20.816 --> 00:17:23.210
them,
it was because they were

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:27.539
skeptical that there is a useful
expertise in these areas,

00:17:27.539 --> 00:17:31.795
and that if it did exist it
could safely and profitably be

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:35.623
employed for the public good.
It is not clear,

00:17:35.623 --> 00:17:38.952
to me anyway,
that the experience of the last

00:17:38.952 --> 00:17:43.190
twenty five hundred years has
shown them to be wrong.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:48.938
I don't know what percentage of
the representatives and senators

00:17:48.938 --> 00:17:52.769
in our Congress are lawyers by
training,

00:17:52.769 --> 00:17:55.120
but whatever that figure is,
it's far too large.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.125
It's really extraordinary that
we all sit still for that kind

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:04.988
of thing.
The kind of variety of

00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:11.541
profession that one can find in
our society is absolutely not to

00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:15.910
be seen in our government
institutions.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.188
Well the Athenians would never
permit anything so undemocratic

00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:23.787
as that.
Secondly, it is most unlikely

00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:29.681
that many fools or incompetents
played a significant part in

00:18:29.681 --> 00:18:32.424
public affairs.
Of course,

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:35.525
that's the flip side of
rejecting expertise and

00:18:35.525 --> 00:18:37.884
experience;
you may end up with people who

00:18:37.884 --> 00:18:40.242
don't know what they're talking
about in any shape,

00:18:40.242 --> 00:18:41.940
manner, or form having
influence.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:48.237
Well the Athenians knew that
and they were worried the fact

00:18:48.237 --> 00:18:52.690
that there was a possibility of
idiots,

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:57.397
fools, jerks,
and other unworthies dominating

00:18:57.397 --> 00:19:02.014
the political decisions.
I don't think that it's clear

00:19:02.014 --> 00:19:05.430
that we are better off than they
are in this respect.

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.863
I remember William Buckley once
said, he would rather be ruled,

00:19:09.863 --> 00:19:14.011
governed by the first forty or
whatever he said forty-fifty

00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:17.230
people in the Boston Telephone
Directory,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:23.727
than by the Harvard faculty.
I thought we could all agree

00:19:23.727 --> 00:19:28.180
with that, maybe even the Yale
faculty.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.271
I think that we ought to think
a little bit longer before we

00:19:33.271 --> 00:19:37.759
assume our system is the only
way one can think about

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:41.735
conducting a democracy.
But to get at how the

00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:45.421
Athenians coped with this
problem the assembly itself was

00:19:45.421 --> 00:19:48.449
a far less unwieldy or
incompetent body than is

00:19:48.449 --> 00:19:52.465
generally assumed by its critics
and that you might ordinarily

00:19:52.465 --> 00:19:56.217
think would be the case if
you've got five or six thousand

00:19:56.217 --> 00:19:59.640
people out there trying to make
a decision.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.488
Think of this,
if an Athenian citizen attended

00:20:04.488 --> 00:20:10.630
no more than half the minimum
number of sessions held each

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:14.490
year,
he would hear twenty sets of

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:19.859
debates by the ablest people in
the state, chiefly,

00:20:19.859 --> 00:20:24.345
elected officials or those who
formerly had held elective

00:20:24.345 --> 00:20:28.349
office, the leading politicians
in all factions,

00:20:28.349 --> 00:20:32.620
and a considerable number of
experts on a variety of subjects

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.180
who would simply get up and
express their views.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.429
These were true debates in
which it was not possible to

00:20:40.429 --> 00:20:44.971
hold prepared remarks and look
at your--what do they call these

00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:49.279
books that they use?
Their policy books or whatever;

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:53.187
they were real debates and the
speakers had to respond

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:57.684
extemporaneously to difficult
questions and arguments from the

00:20:57.684 --> 00:21:00.908
opposition,
nor were they irresponsible

00:21:00.908 --> 00:21:04.202
displays, but serious
controversies leading

00:21:04.202 --> 00:21:08.831
immediately to votes that had
important consequences for the

00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:13.307
orators and their audiences.
Now if you assume that each

00:21:13.307 --> 00:21:16.873
attendant at the assembly had
been listening to such

00:21:16.873 --> 00:21:20.230
discussions for an average of
only ten years,

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.225
and many of them would have had
a much longer stretch,

00:21:24.225 --> 00:21:27.166
think of it,
such experiences alone must

00:21:27.166 --> 00:21:30.710
have fashioned a remarkable body
of voters.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.701
Probably,
I would argue,

00:21:32.701 --> 00:21:35.799
more enlightened and
sophisticated than any

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:39.470
comparable group in history.
Apart from that,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.974
every year five hundred
Athenians served on the council,

00:21:43.974 --> 00:21:48.642
where everyday they gained
experience in the management of

00:21:48.642 --> 00:21:53.720
Athens affairs from the most
trivial to the most serious,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.608
producing bills that served as
the basis for the debates and

00:21:57.608 --> 00:22:01.819
votes of the assembly.
So, in any particular assembly

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:06.639
thousands of those attending,
perhaps a majority of them

00:22:06.639 --> 00:22:11.460
would have had that kind of
training on the council.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.655
In light of that breadth of
experience, the notion that

00:22:15.655 --> 00:22:20.084
decisions were made by an
ignorant multitude is simply not

00:22:20.084 --> 00:22:22.901
persuasive.
I like to compare that

00:22:22.901 --> 00:22:27.029
situation with something that I
think perhaps we can understand.

00:22:27.029 --> 00:22:30.947
In the nineteenth century,
when people went to a concert

00:22:30.947 --> 00:22:35.786
of what we call classical music,
almost everybody in the

00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:39.779
audience was a musician of some
kind.

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:43.434
Before radio,
television, recording systems,

00:22:43.434 --> 00:22:48.109
if you wanted music you had to
play it and so people,

00:22:48.109 --> 00:22:52.458
especially women but men too,
studied how to play various

00:22:52.458 --> 00:22:56.563
instruments and they could.
So, they could read music and

00:22:56.563 --> 00:23:00.589
they could understand it in a
way that only a participant can.

00:23:00.589 --> 00:23:04.684
Hardly anybody who goes to a
concert today is in that

00:23:04.684 --> 00:23:07.795
situation.
So, Beethoven and Brahms and

00:23:07.795 --> 00:23:12.357
people like that wrote their
compositions and orchestras and

00:23:12.357 --> 00:23:16.843
so on and they played to people
who were in a certain sense

00:23:16.843 --> 00:23:19.118
almost experts,
in any case,

00:23:19.118 --> 00:23:23.401
very well educated amateurs.
That's the analogy I would

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:26.680
suggest that we're talking about
that.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.078
A professional politician so to
speak, insofar as there were any

00:23:30.078 --> 00:23:33.261
in Athens, we're dealing with
people who didn't just come in

00:23:33.261 --> 00:23:36.119
off the street and didn't know
anything about it.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:40.486
They were prepared by their
life's experience to be a very,

00:23:40.486 --> 00:23:44.747
very tough audience indeed.
But that raises the question,

00:23:44.747 --> 00:23:48.974
were debates in the assembly
carried on by ordinary citizens

00:23:48.974 --> 00:23:52.915
without the necessary special
knowledge and capacity for

00:23:52.915 --> 00:23:55.564
informed advice?
The evidence,

00:23:55.564 --> 00:23:59.682
I think, suggests not.
For there were impressive

00:23:59.682 --> 00:24:04.286
deterrents, both formal and
informal, that would make an

00:24:04.286 --> 00:24:06.798
inexperienced,
ill informed,

00:24:06.798 --> 00:24:11.736
poorly educated man reluctant
to speak up in the assembly or

00:24:11.736 --> 00:24:15.435
the council even.
To begin with I would

00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:19.068
suggest another analogy for you.
For the many,

00:24:19.068 --> 00:24:23.196
many years I have attended
meetings of faculties at great

00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:27.756
American universities,
what I have seen is that very

00:24:27.756 --> 00:24:33.469
few and generally the same few
are bold enough to speak for or

00:24:33.469 --> 00:24:38.433
against some not very
controversial policy argued in a

00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:42.180
group of fewer than hundred
people,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.773
not to mention those rare,
larger meetings when subjects

00:24:46.773 --> 00:24:51.745
arousing passions are at issue.
Now the people we're talking

00:24:51.745 --> 00:24:56.650
about, these faculty meetings,
have extraordinary educations,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:01.501
they are alleged to have
unusual intellectual ability,

00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:07.268
and they belong to a profession
where public speaking is part of

00:25:07.268 --> 00:25:10.552
the trade.
The meetings are conducted in

00:25:10.552 --> 00:25:14.144
the decorum of established rules
of order that forbid

00:25:14.144 --> 00:25:16.700
interruptions and personal
attack.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.892
If a guy wants to say that
man is a goddamn liar,

00:25:19.892 --> 00:25:23.023
somebody will call him to
account and say that was a

00:25:23.023 --> 00:25:26.829
violation of personal privilege
and you should cut it out.

00:25:26.829 --> 00:25:29.750
That's not the way it happened
in the Athenian assembly.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.594
Yet, even at these very,
very gentile faculty meetings

00:25:33.594 --> 00:25:36.859
I'm talking about,
those who attend them speak

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:42.770
very rarely if ever.
Why?

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.450
Why?
What is that deters them?

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.536
I ask you, for instance,
you all know the answer but you

00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:51.950
won't speak up.
Why?

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:53.730
Why are you afraid to answer
that question;

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:55.681
you know the answer.
Student: You don't

00:25:55.681 --> 00:25:56.597
want to look
stupid.Professor Donald

00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:59.140
Kagan: Thank you.
That's exactly the reason.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.759
People really are afraid of
that.

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:04.498
They're just afraid that even
if nobody even tells them

00:26:04.498 --> 00:26:06.628
they're stupid,
just the way they react may

00:26:06.628 --> 00:26:08.910
make them feel as though they
are stupid.

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:12.564
This is a fantastic deterrent
and if we don't understand that

00:26:12.564 --> 00:26:16.339
we will not understand the way
the Athenian assembly worked,

00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:19.619
because that--but of course you
know perfectly well their

00:26:19.619 --> 00:26:22.937
problem was much greater.
Meetings of the Athenian

00:26:22.937 --> 00:26:26.049
assembly were not quiet,
seemly occasions.

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:29.348
We should not forget what
Dekaioplis said in Aristophanes

00:26:29.348 --> 00:26:31.410
plays, sitting there on the
Pynx,

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:34.266
he threatened to shout,
to interrupt,

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:38.066
to abuse the speakers.
We shouldn't forget Plato's

00:26:38.066 --> 00:26:41.298
report of how the Athenians
laughed and hooted,

00:26:41.298 --> 00:26:45.513
or shouted down speakers who
lacked what they thought was the

00:26:45.513 --> 00:26:48.831
necessary expertise.
Now, these informal

00:26:48.831 --> 00:26:52.020
deterrents alone,
I believe, sharply limited the

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:54.599
number of speakers in the
assembly,

00:26:54.599 --> 00:26:58.985
but there was also a formal
device that encouraged them to

00:26:58.985 --> 00:27:03.217
take thought before they
intervened and to be careful in

00:27:03.217 --> 00:27:06.910
what they said in these debates
on the Pynx.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:09.926
At some time,
perhaps during the career of

00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:14.341
Pericles, but certainly not more
than fifteen years after his

00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:18.167
death the Athenians introduced a
procedure called the

00:27:18.167 --> 00:27:22.435
grafe para nomo
that had the effect of making

00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:27.660
the citizens in the assembly the
guardians of the constitution.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.966
Any citizen could object to a
proposal made in the council or

00:27:32.966 --> 00:27:37.831
in the assembly simply by
asserting that if contradicted

00:27:37.831 --> 00:27:42.131
an existing law.
That assertion stopped action

00:27:42.131 --> 00:27:47.370
on the proposal or suspended its
enactment, if it had already

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:51.474
been passed.
The proposer was then taken

00:27:51.474 --> 00:27:56.702
before a popular court and if
the jury decided against him,

00:27:56.702 --> 00:28:01.029
his proposal was disallowed and
he was fined.

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:04.589
Three findings that a person
had done this,

00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:08.150
deprived him of his rights as a
citizen.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:12.256
The expectation of the assembly
and its procedures,

00:28:12.256 --> 00:28:16.033
formal and informal,
made it most unlikely that

00:28:16.033 --> 00:28:20.632
ignorance and incompetence
played a very significant role

00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:24.536
in its deliberations.
Of course, there are some

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:28.585
ignorant imbeciles who nothing
will deter, but that's true of

00:28:28.585 --> 00:28:31.856
our system too.
An even graver charge has

00:28:31.856 --> 00:28:35.968
been leveled through the ages
against the kind of democracy

00:28:35.968 --> 00:28:41.220
promoted by Pericles.
It is said to be inherently

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:47.269
unstable, inviting faction and
class warfare.

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:52.433
It is said to be careless of
the rights of property and to

00:28:52.433 --> 00:28:57.869
result in the rule of the poor,
who are the majority over the

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:01.507
rich minority.
These arguments weighed very

00:29:01.507 --> 00:29:05.952
heavily in the thinking of the
founding fathers of the American

00:29:05.952 --> 00:29:08.820
Constitution,
who rejected democracy.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:12.717
You need to be aware of that.
Their notion of what democracy

00:29:12.717 --> 00:29:16.953
was Athenian democracy as
described by its critics and

00:29:16.953 --> 00:29:21.029
they consciously and plainly
rejected democracy.

00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:25.271
They thought something else,
they thought they were creating

00:29:25.271 --> 00:29:28.506
a popular republic,
and by republic they meant

00:29:28.506 --> 00:29:31.310
something different from
democracy.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.364
Starting with the fuller
democracy, instituted by

00:29:39.364 --> 00:29:42.460
Ephialtes and Pericles,
in fact,

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:47.842
we discover an almost unbroken
orderly regime that lasted for a

00:29:47.842 --> 00:29:53.531
hundred and forty years.
Twice it was interrupted by

00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:57.854
oligarchic episodes.
The first resulted from a a

00:29:57.854 --> 00:30:01.053
coup d'état in the
midst of a long and difficult

00:30:01.053 --> 00:30:03.709
war.
The government of that

00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:07.319
oligarchy lasted just four
months.

00:30:07.319 --> 00:30:12.606
The second was imposed by the
Spartans after they won the

00:30:12.606 --> 00:30:17.609
Peloponnesian War that one
lasted less than a year.

00:30:17.609 --> 00:30:20.959
On each occasion,
the full democracy was restored

00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:23.819
without turmoil,
without class warfare,

00:30:23.819 --> 00:30:30.434
without killings or exiles or
revenge, without confiscating

00:30:30.434 --> 00:30:35.782
the property of anybody.
Through many years of hard

00:30:35.782 --> 00:30:39.276
warfare, military defeat,
foreign occupation,

00:30:39.276 --> 00:30:43.872
and oligarchic agitation,
the Athenian democracy

00:30:43.872 --> 00:30:50.666
persisted and showed a restraint
and a moderation rarely equaled

00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:54.552
by any regime.
Now this behavior is all the

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:58.876
more remarkable in light of the
political and constitutional

00:30:58.876 --> 00:31:02.907
conditions that prevailed in the
Periclean democracy and

00:31:02.907 --> 00:31:05.777
thereafter.
Remember that the mass of

00:31:05.777 --> 00:31:09.513
Athenians were not faced with
the power of what has been

00:31:09.513 --> 00:31:12.230
called a military industrial
complex.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:16.322
They were not thwarted by the
complexities of representative

00:31:16.322 --> 00:31:18.819
government by checks and
balances,

00:31:18.819 --> 00:31:22.776
by the machinations of
unscrupulous lobbyists,

00:31:22.776 --> 00:31:27.348
or manipulated by the
irresistible deceptions of mass

00:31:27.348 --> 00:31:33.240
media.They had only to walk
up to the Pynx on assembly day,

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.082
make speeches,
and vote in order to bring

00:31:37.082 --> 00:31:42.269
about the most radical,
social and economic changes.

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:46.932
They could, if they had wanted
to, they could have abolished

00:31:46.932 --> 00:31:51.990
debt which presumably would be
something the poor would favor.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.161
They could institute
confiscatory taxation of the

00:31:56.161 --> 00:31:59.289
rich to the advantage of the
poor.

00:31:59.289 --> 00:32:02.974
The simple expropriation of the
wealthy few, all of these things

00:32:02.974 --> 00:32:06.424
they simply could have done,
nothing would have stopped them

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:10.207
but they never did.
Although political equality,

00:32:10.207 --> 00:32:13.603
that is to say,
equality before the law,

00:32:13.603 --> 00:32:17.869
that was a fundamental
principle of democracy,

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:23.200
but economic equality had no
place in the Athens of Pericles.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.649
On the contrary,
the democracy he led defended

00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:33.188
the right of private property
and made no effort to change its

00:32:33.188 --> 00:32:37.993
unequal distributions.
The oath taken by jurors each

00:32:37.993 --> 00:32:43.049
time that they sat on a jury
included the following clause.

00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:46.825
"I will not allow private debts
to be canceled,

00:32:46.825 --> 00:32:51.340
nor lands or houses belonging
to Athenian citizens to be

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.893
redistributed."
In addition,

00:32:53.893 --> 00:32:58.945
the chief magistrate each year
swore that whatever anyone owns

00:32:58.945 --> 00:33:04.662
before I enter this office,
he will have and hold the same,

00:33:04.662 --> 00:33:08.682
until I leave it.
The Athenians respect for

00:33:08.682 --> 00:33:13.909
property and their refusal to
insist on economic equality go a

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:19.650
long way towards explaining why
their democracy was so peaceful,

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:26.004
so stable, and so durable.
But why were the majority of

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:29.869
citizens so restrained and
moderate?

00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:34.533
Part of the answer lies in
the relatively broad

00:33:34.533 --> 00:33:39.290
distribution of property in
fifth century Athens.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.821
It was by no means equal.
I want to emphasize the word

00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:49.883
"relatively" compared to states
that were oligarchical or

00:33:49.883 --> 00:33:52.829
aristocratic.
Also, in its growing

00:33:52.829 --> 00:33:56.502
prosperity, through the greater
part of that time,

00:33:56.502 --> 00:34:00.549
it's very hard to sustain any
kind of a reasonable,

00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:04.576
moderate regime in times that
are hard, in times in which

00:34:04.576 --> 00:34:09.034
there is great poverty so that
was - these were certainly among

00:34:09.034 --> 00:34:12.269
the reasons why Athens was so
successful.

00:34:12.269 --> 00:34:16.204
But there was always,
you should remember,

00:34:16.204 --> 00:34:21.961
a group of fabulously wealthy
citizens and also thousands who

00:34:21.961 --> 00:34:27.447
were poor by any standard.
It certainly seems clear that

00:34:27.447 --> 00:34:32.753
at any time in this period the
majority of Athenian citizens

00:34:32.753 --> 00:34:36.260
were not rich enough to be
hoplites.

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.269
Not rich enough even to have
those small family farms that

00:34:40.269 --> 00:34:44.757
supported your infantrymen.
So, it's not as though there

00:34:44.757 --> 00:34:48.429
aren't a lot of poor people in
the state.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.879
The poorest,
moreover, those who lacked the

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:52.849
property to quality as
infantrymen,

00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:57.632
were the very men who rode the
ships that brought Athens wealth

00:34:57.632 --> 00:35:01.530
and power and glory.
The last 30 years of the

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:05.746
century furthermore were
terrible times of war,

00:35:05.746 --> 00:35:09.230
plague, impoverishment,
and defeat.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:13.878
Yet neither during nor after
the war did the Athenian masses

00:35:13.878 --> 00:35:18.316
interfere, in any way,
with private property or seek

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:23.498
economic leveling in the two
ways the revolutionaries always

00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:25.818
wanted it,
canceling debts and

00:35:25.818 --> 00:35:29.658
redistributing the land.
In the Periclean democracy,

00:35:29.658 --> 00:35:34.829
the Athenian citizens demanded
only equality before the law.

00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:37.743
I think that is the key
principle to understand when

00:35:37.743 --> 00:35:40.199
you're thinking about Athenian
democracy.

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:43.537
Full political rights for
all citizens,

00:35:43.537 --> 00:35:47.749
and that is what separated the
Athenian democracy from

00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:52.199
oligarchies and aristocracies in
other Greek states,

00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:56.911
and the kind of even chance
that is provided by these two

00:35:56.911 --> 00:36:01.538
things, equality before the law
and participation in the

00:36:01.538 --> 00:36:04.820
political process for all
citizens.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:07.709
By these rules,
the Athenian was willing to

00:36:07.709 --> 00:36:11.149
abide in the face of the
greatest disasters and the

00:36:11.149 --> 00:36:15.163
greatest temptations.
It was this politically equal,

00:36:15.163 --> 00:36:19.519
individualistic law abiding,
and tolerant understanding of

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:24.106
the democracy that Pericles had
done so much to create and to

00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:29.157
which he could appeal,
and point with pride confident

00:36:29.157 --> 00:36:33.440
that his fellow citizens shared
his views.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.389
In their rational,
secular, worldly approach to

00:36:37.389 --> 00:36:41.260
life, in their commitment to
political freedom,

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:44.885
and to the autonomous
importance of the individual in

00:36:44.885 --> 00:36:48.860
a constitutional republican and
democratic public life,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:53.725
the Athenians of Pericles day
were closer to the dominant

00:36:53.725 --> 00:36:58.590
ideas and values of our own era
than any culture that has

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:02.239
appeared to the world since
antiquity.

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:07.523
That is why Periclean Athens,
I believe, has so much meaning

00:37:07.523 --> 00:37:10.323
for us.
But if there is much to learn

00:37:10.323 --> 00:37:13.692
from the similarities,
there's at least as much to

00:37:13.692 --> 00:37:17.198
learn from the differences
between the Athenians and

00:37:17.198 --> 00:37:20.334
ourselves.
Although the Athenians

00:37:20.334 --> 00:37:25.432
value wealth and material goods
as we do, they regarded economic

00:37:25.432 --> 00:37:29.422
life and status,
both as less noble and less

00:37:29.422 --> 00:37:35.235
important than participation and
distinction in public service to

00:37:35.235 --> 00:37:38.906
the community.
Although they were pioneers in

00:37:38.906 --> 00:37:41.741
recognizing the importance,
the autonomy,

00:37:41.741 --> 00:37:44.789
and legitimate claims of the
individual,

00:37:44.789 --> 00:37:49.043
they could not image the
fulfillment of the individual's

00:37:49.043 --> 00:37:53.528
spiritual needs apart from his
involvement in the life of a

00:37:53.528 --> 00:37:56.389
well ordered political
community.

00:37:56.389 --> 00:38:00.121
To understand the achievement
of Pericles and his

00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:03.386
contemporaries,
we thus need to be aware of

00:38:03.386 --> 00:38:08.210
these significant differences.
I think we ought to also study

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:12.220
them with a certain humility.
For in spite of their

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:16.539
antiquity, the ancient Athenians
may have known and believed

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:20.199
things we have either forgotten
or never known,

00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:24.318
and we ought to keep open the
possibility that in some

00:38:24.318 --> 00:38:28.515
respects they might have been
right about some of these

00:38:28.515 --> 00:38:31.616
things.
Now what I've been talking

00:38:31.616 --> 00:38:37.058
about up to now is the workings
of the Athenian Constitution for

00:38:37.058 --> 00:38:41.342
active citizens,
and I remind you,

00:38:41.342 --> 00:38:48.180
that means free men,
adults, who have citizen

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:52.156
parents.
That excludes a lot of people,

00:38:52.156 --> 00:38:56.841
who lived in Athens and so I'd
like to spend a little time also

00:38:56.841 --> 00:39:00.090
talking about two groups of such
people,

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.968
who were excluded from the
political process:

00:39:03.968 --> 00:39:08.022
women and slaves,
both of which have caught the

00:39:08.022 --> 00:39:12.605
attention of modern scholars
eager to demonstrate the

00:39:12.605 --> 00:39:17.541
undemocratic aspects of ancient
Athens when judged by our

00:39:17.541 --> 00:39:21.189
criteria,
which seem more and more to

00:39:21.189 --> 00:39:25.408
require that every living
creature--I was going to say

00:39:25.408 --> 00:39:29.150
every living thing be treated
with equality.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:33.280
I know that of course there
are feelings that people who

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.193
wanted to say that--we all say,
we all agree there should be no

00:39:37.193 --> 00:39:39.159
discrimination between men and
women.

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:42.534
There, of course,
should be no slaves,

00:39:42.534 --> 00:39:47.369
but now we're moving towards
saying that people should

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:52.841
receive citizenship or citizen
rights who aren't even legally

00:39:52.841 --> 00:39:56.628
citizens.
There are many people who want

00:39:56.628 --> 00:40:01.466
to give protections to animals
that now are limited to people

00:40:01.466 --> 00:40:06.304
and there are people also who
want to include trees and other

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:09.530
vegetation under these
protections.

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:15.066
So, we need to examine the
Athenian situation and make our

00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:19.510
judgments about that.
Let's talk about women first.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:24.418
Greek society,
like most cultures throughout

00:40:24.418 --> 00:40:29.965
history, was dominated by men.
This was true of the democratic

00:40:29.965 --> 00:40:34.234
city of Athens in the great days
of Pericles, no less than in

00:40:34.234 --> 00:40:36.577
other Greek cities.
Nevertheless,

00:40:36.577 --> 00:40:39.747
the position of women in
classical Athens has been the

00:40:39.747 --> 00:40:42.260
subject of a great deal of
controversy.

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.593
The bulk of the evidence coming
from the law,

00:40:45.593 --> 00:40:49.685
the actual laws of Athens,
from philosophical and moral

00:40:49.685 --> 00:40:53.524
writings,
and from information about the

00:40:53.524 --> 00:40:59.329
conditions of daily life and the
organization of society shows

00:40:59.329 --> 00:41:04.848
that women were excluded from
most public aspects of public

00:41:04.848 --> 00:41:07.172
life.
They could not vote,

00:41:07.172 --> 00:41:10.741
they could not take part in the
political assemblies,

00:41:10.741 --> 00:41:14.653
they could not hold public
office, or take any direct part

00:41:14.653 --> 00:41:17.759
in politics.
Male citizens of all

00:41:17.759 --> 00:41:21.315
classes had these public
responsibilities and

00:41:21.315 --> 00:41:25.017
opportunities.
The same sources show that in

00:41:25.017 --> 00:41:29.432
the private aspects of life,
women were always under the

00:41:29.432 --> 00:41:33.490
control of a male guardian.
A father at first,

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.517
a husband later,
or failing these,

00:41:36.517 --> 00:41:41.469
an appropriate male relative
designated by the law.

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:46.197
Women married young,
usually between the ages of

00:41:46.197 --> 00:41:50.383
twelve and eighteen.
I think if we think of them as

00:41:50.383 --> 00:41:54.396
being about fifteen years old
we'll probably have a reasonable

00:41:54.396 --> 00:41:57.553
average.
Husbands, on the other hand,

00:41:57.553 --> 00:42:02.333
were typically at least 30 and
usually over it when they

00:42:02.333 --> 00:42:05.667
married.
So, women were always in a

00:42:05.667 --> 00:42:10.787
relationship like that of a
daughter to a father when you

00:42:10.787 --> 00:42:14.170
think about the realities of
life.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:16.869
Marriages, furthermore,
were arranged.

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:20.605
By the way, as in other
societies, the higher you get in

00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:24.477
society the more likely it is
that these marriages will be

00:42:24.477 --> 00:42:27.329
arranged with economic
considerations,

00:42:27.329 --> 00:42:29.789
social considerations
predominating.

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:33.727
As you get lower in
society, I can only suspect,

00:42:33.727 --> 00:42:38.128
because we don't really have
evidence that it was far more

00:42:38.128 --> 00:42:42.065
informal and maybe that
marriages may have been as a

00:42:42.065 --> 00:42:46.234
consequence of mutual desire
than was true of the upper

00:42:46.234 --> 00:42:49.469
classes.
Normally these--I'm shifting

00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:53.968
again to where we have evidence,
and that means probably not the

00:42:53.968 --> 00:42:58.224
poorest women in the city,
the women normally had no

00:42:58.224 --> 00:43:02.187
choice of their husband.
The woman's dowry,

00:43:02.187 --> 00:43:07.125
and dowries were required,
was controlled by a male

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:10.533
relative.
Divorce was very difficult for

00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:14.091
a woman to obtain,
for she needed the approval of

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:17.589
a male relative,
who if he gave that approval

00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:21.767
had then to be willing to serve
as her guardian after the

00:43:21.767 --> 00:43:25.914
dissolution of her marriage.
In case of divorce the

00:43:25.914 --> 00:43:30.217
dowry would be returned with the
woman, but it was still to be

00:43:30.217 --> 00:43:33.110
controlled in that case by her
father,

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:36.090
or the appropriate male
relative.

00:43:40.929 --> 00:43:45.596
The main function and
responsibility of a respectable

00:43:45.596 --> 00:43:48.736
Athenian woman,
of a citizen family,

00:43:48.736 --> 00:43:54.389
was to produce male heirs for
the household of her husband.

00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:57.616
If, however,
her father's household lacked a

00:43:57.616 --> 00:44:01.744
male heir, the daughter became
what the Greeks called an

00:44:01.744 --> 00:44:06.862
epikleros,
the heiress to the family

00:44:06.862 --> 00:44:09.533
property.
In that case,

00:44:09.533 --> 00:44:14.932
she was required by law to
marry the man who was the next

00:44:14.932 --> 00:44:20.621
of kin on her father's side,
in order to produce the desired

00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:24.465
male offspring.
In the Athenian way of

00:44:24.465 --> 00:44:29.341
thinking, women were lent by one
household to another for

00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:34.392
purposes of bearing and raising
a male heir to continue the

00:44:34.392 --> 00:44:40.940
existence of the oikos,
the family establishment.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.782
Because the pure and
legitimate lineage of the

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:49.408
offspring was important women
were carefully segregated from

00:44:49.408 --> 00:44:54.348
men outside the family and were
confined to the women's quarters

00:44:54.348 --> 00:44:58.106
even in the house.
Men might seek sexual

00:44:58.106 --> 00:45:02.663
gratification in several ways
outside the house with

00:45:02.663 --> 00:45:05.880
prostitutes of high or low
style,

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.801
prostitutes frequently
recruited from abroad,

00:45:09.801 --> 00:45:14.969
but respectable women stayed
home to raise the children,

00:45:14.969 --> 00:45:19.849
cook, weave cloth,
and oversee the management of

00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:24.041
the household.
The only public function of

00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:28.917
women was an important one in
the various rituals and

00:45:28.917 --> 00:45:34.561
festivals of the state religion.
There is a very new book by a

00:45:34.561 --> 00:45:39.367
professor at NYU by the name of
Connelly, which studies very

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:44.335
carefully all the information
that we know about ancient Greek

00:45:44.335 --> 00:45:49.089
priestesses which reveals,
I think, something that we

00:45:49.089 --> 00:45:54.062
haven't known enough about
before, that women in that realm

00:45:54.062 --> 00:45:58.864
at least had an enormously
important and I would say sort

00:45:58.864 --> 00:46:03.460
of glorious role in that way.
It doesn't change any of

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:07.119
the things I've said about the
other aspects of life but we've

00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:10.960
really not paid enough attention
to this religious side of things

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.440
and we should remember that
religion was very important for

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.920
these people even though to us
it looks as though they were

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.559
very secular in the way they
lived.

00:46:20.559 --> 00:46:23.880
Religion in their way of
thinking was very important.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.521
So anyway, apart from these
religious things,

00:46:27.521 --> 00:46:31.660
Athenian women were expected to
remain home, quiet,

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:35.331
and unnoticed.
Pericles told the widows and

00:46:35.331 --> 00:46:40.005
mothers of the Athenian men who
died in the first year of the

00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:44.472
Peloponnesian War only this.
You will either have read or

00:46:44.472 --> 00:46:48.210
you will read the Pericles
famous funeral oration,

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:52.812
and he has all these things to
say, and at the very end he

00:46:52.812 --> 00:46:56.849
addresses the widows and the
mothers of the men,

00:46:56.849 --> 00:47:01.364
who have died in a way that
puzzles me beyond belief and I

00:47:01.364 --> 00:47:05.880
still don't understand why he
chose to say what he did.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.306
But what he said,
I think, was the common wisdom

00:47:09.306 --> 00:47:14.337
about what the situation was.
He said, "your great glory is

00:47:14.337 --> 00:47:19.418
not to fall short of your
natural character and the

00:47:19.418 --> 00:47:25.720
greatest glory of women is to be
least talked about by men,

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:32.829
whether for good or ill."
Okay, that's what they thought.

00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:36.380
Why the hell did he say it at
the end of that funeral oration?

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:39.556
If anybody has any insight on
that, I would be very grateful

00:47:39.556 --> 00:47:42.984
if you would tell me about it;
now or at any time in the

00:47:42.984 --> 00:47:45.963
future.
The picture derived from these

00:47:45.963 --> 00:47:50.667
sources is largely accurate,
but I would argue that it does

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:55.209
not fit in well with what we
learn from the evidence of a

00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:59.537
wholly different set of sources.
First of all,

00:47:59.537 --> 00:48:05.462
what we see in the pictorial
art chiefly in vase paintings,

00:48:05.462 --> 00:48:09.139
and even more strikingly I
think,

00:48:09.139 --> 00:48:13.461
in what we learned from the
tragedies, and the comedies that

00:48:13.461 --> 00:48:17.929
were performed every year at two
great festivals in Athens.

00:48:17.929 --> 00:48:21.593
Finally,
these things derive very much

00:48:21.593 --> 00:48:25.436
from the mythology,
which is after all their

00:48:25.436 --> 00:48:29.099
religious tradition of the
Athenians.

00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:34.531
Now these sources often show
women as central characters and

00:48:34.531 --> 00:48:40.239
powerful figures in both the
public and the private spheres.

00:48:40.239 --> 00:48:44.332
The Clytemnestra,
who shows up in Aeschylus'

00:48:44.332 --> 00:48:49.566
tragedy Agamemnon,
she arranges the murder of her

00:48:49.566 --> 00:48:55.086
royal husband and establishes
the tyranny of her lover whom

00:48:55.086 --> 00:49:00.449
she dominates.
Then there is the terrifying

00:49:00.449 --> 00:49:07.984
and powerful Medea of Euripides,
who negotiates with kings and

00:49:07.984 --> 00:49:13.050
can commit horrible deeds in her
fury,

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:17.354
which I think Euripides
suggests is very justified fury,

00:49:17.354 --> 00:49:21.746
even if the deed is not.
And these are just two examples

00:49:21.746 --> 00:49:25.851
of which there are many,
in which women are central and

00:49:25.851 --> 00:49:27.561
important,
and powerful,

00:49:27.561 --> 00:49:30.559
and active, and not passive,
and it's all about them.

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:34.680
We are left with an
apparent contradiction,

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:39.607
clearly revealed by a famous
speech in Euripides tragedy

00:49:39.607 --> 00:49:43.190
Medea and I'd like to read you
that.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:46.960
He presented his play at the
Dionysiac festival in Athens.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:53.630
His heroine Medea is a foreign
woman who has unusual powers.

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:56.664
I mean she is practically
something like a witch,

00:49:56.664 --> 00:49:59.422
a sorceress;
don't imagine these Halloween

00:49:59.422 --> 00:50:02.392
kind of witches,
a proper witch is so beautiful

00:50:02.392 --> 00:50:07.070
that she can bewitch you;
think of that.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.761
So she's a foreign woman with
these powers,

00:50:09.761 --> 00:50:13.671
but in the speech that follows
she describes the fate of women

00:50:13.671 --> 00:50:17.131
in terms that appear to give an
accurate account of the

00:50:17.131 --> 00:50:20.080
condition of women in fifth
century B.C.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:23.158
Athens.
Here's what she says,

00:50:23.158 --> 00:50:27.424
"Of all things which are living
and can form a judgment,

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:31.070
we women are the most
unfortunate creatures.

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:36.355
Firstly, with an excess of
wealth, it is required for us to

00:50:36.355 --> 00:50:40.820
buy a husband and take for our
bodies a master.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:45.653
For not to take one is even
worse, and now the question is

00:50:45.653 --> 00:50:49.469
serious, whether we take a good
or bad one,

00:50:49.469 --> 00:50:54.703
for there is no easy escape for
a woman, nor can she say no to

00:50:54.703 --> 00:50:58.693
her marriage.
She arrives among new modes of

00:50:58.693 --> 00:51:03.469
behavior and manners,
and she needs prophetic power,

00:51:03.469 --> 00:51:07.799
unless she has learned at home
how best to manage him who

00:51:07.799 --> 00:51:12.629
shares the bed with her.
If we work out all this well

00:51:12.629 --> 00:51:16.958
and carefully,
and the husband lives with us

00:51:16.958 --> 00:51:21.790
and likely bears his yoke,
this life is enviable,

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:26.544
if not I'd rather die."
"A man when he's tired of

00:51:26.544 --> 00:51:30.813
the company in his home goes out
of the house and puts and end to

00:51:30.813 --> 00:51:34.549
his boredom and turns to a
friend or companion of his own

00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:37.741
age,
but we are forced to keep our

00:51:37.741 --> 00:51:41.557
eyes on one alone.
What they say of us is that we

00:51:41.557 --> 00:51:45.934
have a peaceful time living at
home, while they do the fighting

00:51:45.934 --> 00:51:50.119
in war.
How wrong they are!

00:51:50.119 --> 00:51:57.219
I would very much rather stand
three times in the front of

00:51:57.219 --> 00:52:03.426
battle than to bear one child."
I wonder what the Athenian

00:52:03.426 --> 00:52:06.780
men in that audience thought
about all of that.

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.234
The picture that Medea paints
that women subjected to men

00:52:10.234 --> 00:52:13.380
accords well of course with much
of the evidence,

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:17.609
but we have to take note of the
fact that the woman who

00:52:17.609 --> 00:52:22.230
complains of women's lot is the
powerful central figure in a

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:27.439
tragedy that is named after her.
By the way, it's not the only

00:52:27.439 --> 00:52:31.807
case, another of the great
tragedies of Attic drama is

00:52:31.807 --> 00:52:36.467
Sophocles' Antigone,
and Antigone is another heroic

00:52:36.467 --> 00:52:40.477
woman who defies kings and
everybody else in order to do

00:52:40.477 --> 00:52:45.071
the right thing and who accepts
death rather than to give way in

00:52:45.071 --> 00:52:48.367
her principles.
This is not the kind of a woman

00:52:48.367 --> 00:52:51.805
that Pericles had in mind when
he said, just shut up and be

00:52:51.805 --> 00:52:56.647
sure nobody's talking about you.
Now, this tragedy was produced,

00:52:56.647 --> 00:53:01.199
we need to remember,
at state expense before most of

00:53:01.199 --> 00:53:05.634
the Athenian population,
and was written by a man,

00:53:05.634 --> 00:53:10.250
who was one of the Athens
greatest poets and dramatists.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:13.757
Medea is a cause of terror
to the audience,

00:53:13.757 --> 00:53:17.492
and at the same time,
and object of their pity and

00:53:17.492 --> 00:53:20.389
sympathy as a victim of
injustice.

00:53:20.389 --> 00:53:23.972
She is anything but the
creature least talked about by

00:53:23.972 --> 00:53:27.866
men whether for good or for bad.
When those men walked out of

00:53:27.866 --> 00:53:31.173
that theatre they would be
talking about Medea for the next

00:53:31.173 --> 00:53:34.334
week.
There is reason to believe that

00:53:34.334 --> 00:53:39.482
the role played by Athenian
women may have been more complex

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:43.059
than their legal status might
suggest.

00:53:43.059 --> 00:53:46.412
That's all I feel I can say
about that subject because I

00:53:46.412 --> 00:53:49.400
haven't been able to resolve the
contradiction.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.462
Well I won't go into modern
scholarly arguments but let me

00:53:54.462 --> 00:53:58.369
just say that no matter what
they all say,

00:53:58.369 --> 00:54:02.136
no matter how they come out,
this dichotomy is there,

00:54:02.136 --> 00:54:05.670
it's in the sources.
We need to do something and

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:09.552
some supplying for things that
are missing if we are to

00:54:09.552 --> 00:54:13.649
comprehend how both halves of
this can be true as I'm sure

00:54:13.649 --> 00:54:17.592
they both are somehow.
Let's turn next to the

00:54:17.592 --> 00:54:22.018
question of slavery.
In Greece, chattel slavery

00:54:22.018 --> 00:54:27.309
proper began to increase about
five hundred B.C.

00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:31.329
and it remained an important
element in society.

00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:36.150
The main sources of slaves were
war captives and the captives of

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:40.588
pirates, who made a living in
large part by catching people

00:54:40.588 --> 00:54:45.470
and selling them as slaves,
and of course those people at

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.800
first enslaved through war
piracy or other means,

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.114
who were sold by slave traders.
They did not,

00:54:54.114 --> 00:54:58.652
unlike in the American south
were they successful,

00:54:58.652 --> 00:55:04.210
nor necessarily did they try,
to breed slaves themselves.

00:55:04.210 --> 00:55:07.159
They were typically bought from
slave traders.

00:55:07.159 --> 00:55:10.037
Like the Chinese,
the Egyptians,

00:55:10.037 --> 00:55:14.957
and almost every other
civilized people in the ancient

00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:19.969
world the Greeks regarded
foreigners as inferiors.

00:55:19.969 --> 00:55:23.820
They called them
barbarians, because they uttered

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.227
words that sounded to the Greeks
like bar, bar,

00:55:27.227 --> 00:55:29.721
bar, bar, bar.
Most slaves,

00:55:29.721 --> 00:55:33.690
working for the Greeks,
were foreigners.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:40.076
Greeks sometimes enslaved
Greeks, but typically not to

00:55:40.076 --> 00:55:47.065
serve in the Greek home as a
servant--really not so much at

00:55:47.065 --> 00:55:49.496
home.
They did use slaves,

00:55:49.496 --> 00:55:53.199
as I've told you earlier,
to work on the farms alongside

00:55:53.199 --> 00:55:55.984
the farmers.
The chief occupation,

00:55:55.984 --> 00:56:00.800
as always before the twentieth
century, was agriculture.

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.980
The great majority of Greek
farmers worked these small

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:08.530
holdings to poor to support even
one slave.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:13.170
Some would be so fortunate as
to have as many as one or two

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:17.244
slaves to work alongside them.
I think, as I said earlier,

00:56:17.244 --> 00:56:20.610
I think probably most of the
hoplites could manage that but I

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.360
think we really don't know the
answer to that.

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:26.119
I'm sure they range from zero
to more than two,

00:56:26.119 --> 00:56:29.599
but if you're thinking one or
two you're probably right.

00:56:29.599 --> 00:56:32.138
The upper classes had
larger farms,

00:56:32.138 --> 00:56:35.946
of course, that would be led
out to free tenant farmers or

00:56:35.946 --> 00:56:39.700
worked by slaves,
generally under an overseer,

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:44.467
who was himself a slave.
Large landowners generally did

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:47.489
not have one single great
estate.

00:56:47.489 --> 00:56:51.426
In every way I want you to try
to get out of your head the

00:56:51.426 --> 00:56:54.742
picture of slavery in the
American South with its

00:56:54.742 --> 00:56:58.610
plantations and great squads of
slaves in one place,

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:03.098
under one master.
That was not the typical way

00:57:03.098 --> 00:57:06.152
for the Greeks,
but rather the wealthy would

00:57:06.152 --> 00:57:10.130
have several smaller farms
scattered about the polis.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.028
Well that arrangement did not
encourage the amassing of these

00:57:14.028 --> 00:57:17.861
great hordes of agricultural
slaves who would later work the

00:57:17.861 --> 00:57:21.110
cotton and sugar plantations of
the new world.

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:25.090
Slaves were used in larger
numbers in what I laughingly

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.630
call industry in the ancient
world,

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:31.938
I mean handicrafts,
but one exception to that

00:57:31.938 --> 00:57:36.926
typical system was mining.
We know something about the

00:57:36.926 --> 00:57:41.504
mines in southern Athens,
where the silver was found and

00:57:41.504 --> 00:57:44.500
that reveals a different
picture.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:49.802
Nicias, a wealthy Athenian of
fifth century B.C.,

00:57:49.802 --> 00:57:55.326
owned a thousand slaves,
whom he rented to a mining

00:57:55.326 --> 00:58:01.949
contractor for a profit.
But this is unique;

00:58:01.949 --> 00:58:06.203
we don't know of anything like
this besides this situation,

00:58:06.203 --> 00:58:10.309
and it's by far the largest
number of slaves that we know

00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:14.393
any individual held.
In another instance of large

00:58:14.393 --> 00:58:18.708
slave holdings in Athens,
a family of resident aliens

00:58:18.708 --> 00:58:23.438
employed about a hundred and
twenty slaves in their shield

00:58:23.438 --> 00:58:28.750
factory that was the military
industrial complex in Athens.

00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:33.191
Most manufacturing,
however, was at very small

00:58:33.191 --> 00:58:38.630
scale with shops using one or
two, or a handful of slaves.

00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:42.466
Slaves worked as craftsmen in
almost every trade,

00:58:42.466 --> 00:58:46.543
and it was true for the
agricultural slaves on small

00:58:46.543 --> 00:58:50.300
farms, they worked alongside
their masters.

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:55.007
If you took these slaves that I
regard as taking care of the

00:58:55.007 --> 00:58:59.776
majority of the work in Athens,
if you translated them into

00:58:59.776 --> 00:59:03.813
being handymen or regular
workers who worked at jobs

00:59:03.813 --> 00:59:07.938
regularly who were free,
if you went in you went into

00:59:07.938 --> 00:59:12.057
these shops that's what you
would think, because you didn't

00:59:12.057 --> 00:59:16.460
have somebody lashing anybody
over great numbers of people.

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:18.179
You would have two or three
guys working there.

00:59:18.179 --> 00:59:22.357
One would be the guy who owns
it, and maybe the other two guys

00:59:22.357 --> 00:59:25.491
would be slaves.
A significant proportion of

00:59:25.491 --> 00:59:28.682
slaves of course were domestic
servants and many were

00:59:28.682 --> 00:59:32.115
shepherds.
Publicly held slaves also

00:59:32.115 --> 00:59:36.536
served as policemen;
don't get carried away there

00:59:36.536 --> 00:59:40.189
were very, very few policemen.
They were also prison

00:59:40.189 --> 00:59:41.842
attendants;
there were very,

00:59:41.842 --> 00:59:44.309
very few prisons and very few
prisoners.

00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:47.473
There were clerks,
and there were secretaries and

00:59:47.473 --> 00:59:51.889
some of them worked their way up
because of their natural skills,

00:59:51.889 --> 00:59:54.667
if they worked--this was
usually the case,

00:59:54.667 --> 00:59:57.310
if you found such people in
commerce,

00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:01.314
and most especially in banking.
We hear that one of the richest

01:00:01.314 --> 01:00:05.159
men in Athens in the fourth
century was a man called Pazian

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:08.565
who had been a slave,
and by his talents had bought

01:00:08.565 --> 01:00:11.445
his own freedom,
and then had become one of the

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:14.800
richest men in Athens.
That's an oddball story;

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.804
don't take that as being very
widespread, but it shows you one

01:00:18.804 --> 01:00:22.066
element in the system.
The number of slaves in

01:00:22.066 --> 01:00:25.563
ancient Greece is a subject of
continuing controversy and

01:00:25.563 --> 01:00:29.373
that's because we don't have the
kind of evidence to come to a

01:00:29.373 --> 01:00:32.973
conclusive answer.
There are no useful figures for

01:00:32.973 --> 01:00:37.160
the absolute number of slaves,
or for their percentage of the

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.369
free population,
in any city except Athens.

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:43.822
There the evidence permits
estimates for the slave

01:00:43.822 --> 01:00:46.429
population in the classical
period,

01:00:46.429 --> 01:00:51.409
by which I mean the fifth and
the fourth centuries that range

01:00:51.409 --> 01:00:56.056
from a low of twenty thousand
slaves to a high of about a

01:00:56.056 --> 01:01:00.353
hundred thousand slaves.
If we accept the meaning

01:01:00.353 --> 01:01:04.711
between these extremes,
I love to do that when I don't

01:01:04.711 --> 01:01:09.563
have any better thing to do,
you come up with sixty thousand

01:01:09.563 --> 01:01:12.450
slaves.
Now, the estimates that are

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:16.190
made about the free population
of Athens in the same period at

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:19.442
this height,
some people would say as low

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:23.940
as--nobody gets much below forty
thousand households,

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.220
some want to move it up towards
about sixty thousand households.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:31.445
What do I come up with?
Right fifty thousand - that

01:01:31.445 --> 01:01:36.699
would yield a figure of fewer
than two slaves per family.

01:01:36.699 --> 01:01:41.587
It has been estimated that only
a quarter to a third of free

01:01:41.587 --> 01:01:44.570
Athenians owned any slaves at
all.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:48.935
So, the distribution was
unequal, with most families

01:01:48.935 --> 01:01:53.130
having no slaves and some
families having many.

01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:56.716
Some historians have noted that
in the American south,

01:01:56.716 --> 01:01:59.219
in the period before the Civil
War,

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:04.229
where slaves also made up less
than a third of the total

01:02:04.229 --> 01:02:10.239
population and three quarters of
free southerners had no slaves.

01:02:10.239 --> 01:02:14.090
The proportion of slaves to
free citizens was similar to

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:17.433
that in ancient Athens.
Because slavery was so

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:20.742
important to the economy of the
south, these historians

01:02:20.742 --> 01:02:24.236
suggested it may have been
equally important and similarly

01:02:24.236 --> 01:02:29.326
oppressive in ancient Athens.
I find several problems with

01:02:29.326 --> 01:02:32.414
this analogy.
For one thing it's important to

01:02:32.414 --> 01:02:35.429
make a distinction between a
world such as the cotton states

01:02:35.429 --> 01:02:37.780
of the American south before the
Civil War,

01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:43.117
where a single cash crop well
suited for exploitation by large

01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:46.366
groups of slaves,
dominates the economy,

01:02:46.366 --> 01:02:50.550
and a society like the one in
Athens, where the economy was

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:52.856
mixed,
the crops varied,

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:58.508
the land and its distribution
very poorly suited to massive

01:02:58.508 --> 01:03:01.811
slavery.
Another major difference is in

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:05.159
the likelihood of a slave
achieving freedom.

01:03:05.159 --> 01:03:08.870
The freeing of American slaves,
although it happened,

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.295
was comparatively rare,
but in Greece it was very

01:03:12.295 --> 01:03:14.543
common.
The most famous example

01:03:14.543 --> 01:03:17.472
I've told you already about,
Pasion who began as a bank

01:03:17.472 --> 01:03:19.182
clerk,
earned his freedom,

01:03:19.182 --> 01:03:23.044
became Athens richest banker,
and then was even rewarded with

01:03:23.044 --> 01:03:25.940
Athenian citizenship but that's
very rare.

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.751
On the other hand,
the acquisition of freedom by

01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:34.181
slaves was not.
People frequently free their

01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:40.501
slaves on their own death and
often before that for various

01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:43.248
reasons.
It's also important to

01:03:43.248 --> 01:03:46.839
distinguish the American south
where the slaves were

01:03:46.839 --> 01:03:50.360
distinguished from their masters
by skin color,

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:55.053
where the masters were
increasingly hostile to the idea

01:03:55.053 --> 01:03:58.530
of freeing slaves,
and in terror of slave

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:04.179
rebellions with a very different
society of classical Athens.

01:04:04.179 --> 01:04:09.741
There slaves walked the streets
with such ease as to offend

01:04:09.741 --> 01:04:13.289
noblemen, who were class
conscious.

01:04:13.289 --> 01:04:16.555
Plato complained about the
Athenian democracy,

01:04:16.555 --> 01:04:20.420
that men and women who have
been sold are no less free than

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:23.567
their purchasers.
An anonymous writer of the

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:27.197
fifth century was appalled by
the behavior of slaves in

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:30.466
Athens.
He says, "One may not strike

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:35.010
them there, nor will a slave
step aside for you,

01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:38.810
and if it were legal for a free
man to strike a slave an

01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.611
Athenian would often have been
struck under the mistaken

01:04:42.611 --> 01:04:47.226
impression that he was a slave.
For the clothing of the common

01:04:47.226 --> 01:04:51.618
people there is no way superior
to that of the slaves and the

01:04:51.618 --> 01:04:54.840
resident aliens,
nor is their appearance.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:59.316
They allow slaves there to live
in luxury and some of them in

01:04:59.316 --> 01:05:03.269
considerable magnificence."
An estate relying on naval

01:05:03.269 --> 01:05:07.125
power, it is inevitable that
slaves must work for hire so

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:10.429
that we may take profits from
what they earn.

01:05:10.429 --> 01:05:14.509
While there are rich slaves,
it is no longer profitable for

01:05:14.509 --> 01:05:18.757
my slave to be afraid of you.
In Sparta, my slave would be

01:05:18.757 --> 01:05:22.965
afraid of you but there in
Athens, if your slave is afraid

01:05:22.965 --> 01:05:25.346
of me,
he will probably spend some of

01:05:25.346 --> 01:05:27.519
his own to free himself from
danger."

01:05:27.519 --> 01:05:31.281
This, then,
is why in the matter of free

01:05:31.281 --> 01:05:36.179
speech we have put slaves and
free men on equal terms.

01:05:36.179 --> 01:05:39.150
Now a lot of this is absolute
baloney;

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:42.780
this is some right wing
character who is just so annoyed

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.279
with Athenian democracy that he
is making over the top

01:05:46.279 --> 01:05:49.796
statements,
but it cannot be so far removed

01:05:49.796 --> 01:05:54.768
from reality as to be ridiculous
or else it wouldn't be in any

01:05:54.768 --> 01:05:58.449
persuasive.
So, I think we have to imagine

01:05:58.449 --> 01:06:03.782
slaves moved about Athens with a
degree of ease and security and

01:06:03.782 --> 01:06:08.608
as must rightly be saying you
really couldn't tell a slave

01:06:08.608 --> 01:06:13.010
from a free man very readily in
ancient Athens.

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:18.544
All of this is meant to be by
contrast with the picture of the

01:06:18.544 --> 01:06:19.270
south.

01:06:24.059 --> 01:06:28.187
Even more remarkable,
the Athenians were on occasion

01:06:28.187 --> 01:06:32.690
willing to contemplate the
liberation of all their slaves.

01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:38.061
In 406, their city facing
defeat in the Peloponnesian War,

01:06:38.061 --> 01:06:42.584
they freed all slaves of
military age and granted

01:06:42.584 --> 01:06:48.332
citizenship to those who rode
the ships that won the Battle of

01:06:48.332 --> 01:06:52.090
Arginusae.
Twice more, at crucial moments,

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:56.010
similar proposals were made
although without success.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:07:01.167
Now during the Civil War people
did suggest to the South that

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:06.497
they liberate their slaves and
enroll them in the Southern army

01:07:06.497 --> 01:07:09.849
and such ideas were always
quashed,

01:07:09.849 --> 01:07:12.498
and I think we can read
something very important into

01:07:12.498 --> 01:07:14.739
the difference between the two
situations.

01:07:14.739 --> 01:07:19.062
The southerners were afraid to
do it because they didn't trust

01:07:19.062 --> 01:07:23.031
the slaves not to turn on them
and kill them if they were

01:07:23.031 --> 01:07:25.563
armed.
The Athenians just didn't

01:07:25.563 --> 01:07:29.148
have that fear at all and I
think that's a big story about

01:07:29.148 --> 01:07:31.789
the difference between the two
systems.

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:38.170
Okay, that's all I have to say
about these subjects.

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.563
We do have six,
seven, eight minutes I'd be

01:07:40.563 --> 01:07:43.924
delighted to respond to any
comments or questions any of you

01:07:43.924 --> 01:07:46.659
would like to put about any of
these topics.

01:07:46.659 --> 01:07:49.067
Yes sir?Student: Why
do you think the Athenians did

01:07:49.067 --> 01:07:50.804
not fear their
slaves?Professor Donald

01:07:50.804 --> 01:07:52.619
Kagan: They did not fear
their slaves,

01:07:52.619 --> 01:07:56.744
because I think in the first
place they did not treat them so

01:07:56.744 --> 01:08:00.938
harshly as to create that kind
of absolute hatred that nothing

01:08:00.938 --> 01:08:03.631
could take care of.
Second of all,

01:08:03.631 --> 01:08:08.396
I think because the prospect of
their liberation being not an

01:08:08.396 --> 01:08:12.842
out of the question idea
softened the edge between master

01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:17.845
and slave to a degree where the
Athenians didn't have that sense

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:21.260
these people are waiting to kill
me.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.390
I guess another thing is since
so many of them--first of all

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:29.724
you start with household slaves,
well even in the south there

01:08:29.724 --> 01:08:33.632
were very, very few household
slaves, who did not develop

01:08:33.632 --> 01:08:37.960
friendly and warm feelings
towards the people in the house.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.143
So, that takes care of another
situation and than there are all

01:08:41.143 --> 01:08:44.069
these slaves who worked side by
side with their master,

01:08:44.069 --> 01:08:48.088
not as part of a gang under an
overseer, but as a fellow worker

01:08:48.088 --> 01:08:51.751
with their farmers.
So, the whole way of thinking

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:55.640
about it I think was so
different that--and here's

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.788
another thing,
we never hear of a slave

01:08:58.788 --> 01:09:01.560
rebellion among the polis of
Athens.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.159
We do hear of helot rebellions,
of course.

01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:06.917
It doesn't fit the mold in
Sparta, but we never hear of a

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:10.069
slave rebellion in spite of all
the troubles these towns have.

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:11.680
So, I think those would be the
reasons.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.775
Anything else?
Yes.Student:

01:09:14.775 --> 01:09:18.125
[inaudible]Professor
Donald Kagan: Well when they

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:20.372
had skills,
and this happened in the south

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.600
too, by the way,
just not to the same extent.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.319
When they had skills it was in
the master's interest to

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:30.659
encourage them to do their work
to the best of their ability,

01:09:30.659 --> 01:09:33.897
and so they rewarded them by
letting them keep part of the

01:09:33.897 --> 01:09:37.305
profits of what they produced
and it was that of course which

01:09:37.305 --> 01:09:40.600
allowed some of these people to
buy their own freedom.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:44.130
It is true that that happened
in the south as well.

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:46.913
Anything else,
yes ma'am?Student:

01:09:46.913 --> 01:09:50.668
[inaudible]Professor
Donald Kagan: The answer is

01:09:50.668 --> 01:09:53.840
I'm sure there must have been
runaway slaves,

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.239
but it's just a non-issue so
far as we can see.

01:09:57.239 --> 01:10:01.401
It's the big deal in the south
and the north when fugitive

01:10:01.401 --> 01:10:04.760
slave laws become a great source
of trouble,

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.673
but I think there was not too
much running away of slaves,

01:10:07.673 --> 01:10:10.229
because there really wasn't any
place to run to.

01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:13.859
There was no place where there
wasn't slavery.

01:10:13.859 --> 01:10:17.407
So if an Athenian slave runs to
the Boeotia, he's going to be a

01:10:17.407 --> 01:10:19.750
Boeotian slave,
I think that was one of the

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.236
reasons and put that together
with a rather gentle

01:10:22.236 --> 01:10:25.734
arrangements I've described,
the combination I think reduced

01:10:25.734 --> 01:10:29.779
the problem of runaway slaves.
Anything else?

01:10:29.779 --> 01:10:33.777
Yes?Student: Could
you address the Athenian slavery

01:10:33.777 --> 01:10:36.464
compared to
Sparta?Professor Donald

01:10:36.464 --> 01:10:40.331
Kagan: The Spartan situation
as compared to the Athenian

01:10:40.331 --> 01:10:42.699
situation,
night and day.

01:10:42.699 --> 01:10:44.810
The helots, I've told you all
about it;

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:48.486
you've read all about it,
and as a man leading the

01:10:48.486 --> 01:10:52.762
rebellion in Sparta at the
beginning of the fourth century

01:10:52.762 --> 01:10:57.039
said about helots and other
people who were not Spartiates

01:10:57.039 --> 01:11:01.114
in Lacedaemon,
they would have gladly eaten

01:11:01.114 --> 01:11:05.419
the Spartans raw.
So, that's all you need to know

01:11:05.419 --> 01:11:08.699
about the difference.
Yes.Student:

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:12.107
According to the discussion
about the judicial system and

01:11:12.107 --> 01:11:14.907
the fact the plaintiffs were
fined if they lost

01:11:14.907 --> 01:11:17.828
[inaudible]Professor
Donald Kagan: Too

01:11:17.828 --> 01:11:20.992
badly.Student:
[inaudible]Professor

01:11:20.992 --> 01:11:23.382
Donald Kagan: Yeah.
I don't know,

01:11:23.382 --> 01:11:24.540
how does the British system
work?

01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:27.420
Do they do that?
I've told this story to various

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:30.457
American lawyers and law
professors, and I've been struck

01:11:30.457 --> 01:11:32.680
by their absolute lack of
imagination,

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.193
but when I finally get them to
think about these things they

01:11:36.193 --> 01:11:39.647
tell me that some of them tell
me very happily that in some

01:11:39.647 --> 01:11:43.279
areas we are moving towards that
or we have some of that.

01:11:43.279 --> 01:11:46.490
They tell me that in civil
cases, very often,

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:50.869
the arrangement that they agree
to is that one side will make

01:11:50.869 --> 01:11:54.221
one proposal,
one side will make another

01:11:54.221 --> 01:11:58.770
proposal, and some arbiter will
choose between the two.

01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:01.599
But mostly if I speak to,
especially law professors,

01:12:01.599 --> 01:12:04.428
I've tried to get them to think
about the advantages and

01:12:04.428 --> 01:12:07.670
disadvantages of the Athenian
system with some objectivity,

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:11.721
and I say to them put aside for
the moment the question of

01:12:11.721 --> 01:12:15.702
whether you think justice is
more likely to be arrived at

01:12:15.702 --> 01:12:20.109
through the Anglo-Saxon system
of law or the Athenian system of

01:12:20.109 --> 01:12:22.665
law,
because the truth is we don't

01:12:22.665 --> 01:12:26.228
know one way or the other,
and I found that they can't do

01:12:26.228 --> 01:12:28.817
it.
They're so committed to the

01:12:28.817 --> 01:12:33.803
conviction that justice is only
possible under the Anglo-Saxon

01:12:33.803 --> 01:12:36.909
system of advocacy and
competition,

01:12:36.909 --> 01:12:42.210
and all of those things that
they just won't think about it.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:45.307
But, you of course,
although three quarters of you

01:12:45.307 --> 01:12:47.470
are going to become lawyers
anyway,

01:12:47.470 --> 01:12:51.374
you're above that you'll be
much more judicious in thinking

01:12:51.374 --> 01:12:53.932
about that.
Do I have to make an

01:12:53.932 --> 01:12:56.881
announcement?
Yeah, those of you who were

01:12:56.881 --> 01:13:00.489
good enough to serve as hoplites
in our demonstration,

01:13:00.489 --> 01:13:04.337
it turns out we need for you to
say it's okay for your pictures

01:13:04.337 --> 01:13:07.937
to appear on these deathless
productions that we're engaged

01:13:07.937 --> 01:13:10.091
in now.
So, would you if you could

01:13:10.091 --> 01:13:13.655
please come up forward and speak
with John Lee and he'll talk to

01:13:13.655 --> 01:13:16.000
about what has to happen.
Thanks very much.

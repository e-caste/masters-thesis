PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER:
OK, good morning.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.590
Well, today I want to talk about
what, to me, is a very

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.525
interesting topic, and that
is futures markets.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.230
Not very interesting
to most people.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.160
Most people have no idea
what they are.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.080
But I think that, well, futures
markets, what we're

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.560
really talking about is --

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.240
There are different ways
of viewing it.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.290
Futures markets for things like
agricultural commodities,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.770
or interest rates, or financial
securities, are

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.740
markets about the future.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.550
They're markets that, in some
sense, predict the future.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.630
And future matters, right?

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.390
We live a life.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.120
We have a long horizon.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.090
I said before, I think that your
planning horizon must be

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.280
at least a century, because
you'll probably live that long

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.300
anyway, with modern medicine.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.240
And you care about other
people, too.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.330
So, the beauty of futures
markets is that we have prices

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.880
for the future.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240
We talked already about
forward markets.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.570
We talked about forward
interest rates.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.360
And that is related to what
we're talking about.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.820
Forwards and futures are
similar concepts.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.700
Futures is the more
precise concept.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.090
Or the more developed concept.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.300
And I'll explain the difference
between forwards

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.480
and futures.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.560
But just in a nutshell, futures
markets are organized

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.670
markets, like the stock
market, that trade

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.480
standardized contracts,
representing things that will

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.720
happen at future dates.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.450
And because they're

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.520
standardized, they're worldwide.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.800
Everybody looks at them
and uses them.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.950
Whereas forward markets are more
specialized markets that,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.420
typically, are not as easy
to interpret or as clear.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.910
So, futures markets are, in some
sense, more fundamental

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.860
and important.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.630
I have a particular
interest --

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.240
I've been interested in futures
markets myself for

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.550
many years.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.120
And wondering, why
they're not even

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.890
bigger and more important.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.330
So, in 1993, I wrote a book
called Macro Markets, about

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.300
let's make our markets
bigger and more

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.610
important, and more pervasive.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.910
And I've been trying
to do that.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.820
Notably, in 2006, I was working
with the Chicago

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.540
Mercantile Exchange, which
is the biggest futures

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.150
market in the world.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.310
And we created home
price futures.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.405
And they've been trading
now for five years.

00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:19.700
But I'm not really going to talk
about them, because they

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.310
have so far disappointed.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.590
They're not important,
at least not yet.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.720
But I'm going to
talk about some

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.105
important futures markets.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.980
First, I want to put just a
couple of definitions up.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.590
Futures, that's what we're going
to talk about most in

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.550
this lecture, and it has a
special meaning in finance.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.445
And I was contrasting
that to forwards.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.605
But both of these together
are derivatives.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.360
And that means that the price in
these markets derives from

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.580
a price in some other market.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:34.460
There's a primary or underlying
market, which has

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:35.630
its own price.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.280
And then there's a derivative
market that has a futures

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.850
price or a forward price.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.090
I guess I'm speaking in kind of
abstract terms. Well, let

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.810
me just start --

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.910
I want to give you an example,
and we'll see better what I'm

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:55.810
talking about.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.950
But let me just first comment
just on this word,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.410
derivatives.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.120
To people in finance,
derivatives are an exciting

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.580
development of financial
markets.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.120
We start out with a simple
market and we develop

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.610
derivative markets, that add
more detail and information

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.550
than was in the underlying
or primary market.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.510
That's exciting.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.020
I find it exciting.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.455
However --

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:28.390
I don't know how often you hear
this word, derivative --

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.650
it's become a four-letter
word.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.670
It's become an ugly word.

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:37.220
Why is that?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.030
I think it's, because people
blame the current financial

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.240
crisis on derivatives, whether
rightly or wrongly.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:54.030
And it's because, I think,
there's a public anger about

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.560
derivatives that is largely
due to misunderstanding.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.610
I mentioned before that I think
that finance tends to

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.370
attract sociopaths.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.190
I mentioned that, I defined
that for you.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.960
People who want to manipulate,
and fool, and deceive people.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.030
But I don't think the financial
community is

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.200
particularly populated
by sociopaths.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.850
You might think so, reading
some accounts.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.460
But I think, it's not true.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.580
And I think, it's not true,
because the financial

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.460
community knows about
this problem

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.350
and ejects such people.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.460
They get caught.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.590
And you can't make a career in
finance if you're a sociopath.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.930
So, if you think you have this
problem, that you have

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.950
sociopathic tendencies, I would
advise you not to go

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.440
into finance, because you will
get caught and ejected.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.230
So, save yourself the trouble.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.130
Don't go into finance.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.910
Pick some field where you
can't hurt anybody.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.010
And that would be a smart
thing to do, if

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:05.980
you have such a problem.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.790
So, I think we need to regulate
derivatives markets,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.220
and that's what I'm
talking about.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.640
And we need self-regulation of
the markets themselves, but we

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.120
need government regulation
as well.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.660
But there's nothing evil
about derivatives.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.290
And in fact, derivatives are
fundamental to the way I think

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.350
a modern economy works.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.690
So, I had you read
an article --

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.390
I put it on an earlier section
of the reading list --

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:47.765
by Charles Conant, who wrote
a book in 1904 called Wall

00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:49.350
Street and the Country.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:52.040
And you should have
read that by how.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.540
He starts out by saying, it's
just amazing, how public

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:01.660
opinion thinks that speculation
is evil.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:05.690
And they don't understand that
speculation is just business.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.500
I mean, business decisions
involve

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.460
guesses about the future.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:14.040
And so, when you have
well-developed markets, these

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.640
guesses become market prices.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.849
And so, the prices go into
the calculations

00:08:23.849 --> 00:08:25.150
that everyone makes.

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.680
And the calculations are
just done better.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.330
Somehow, there's just a failure
for most people to

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.580
understand it.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:40.890
And I'm hoping in this lecture
to try to give some more

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.440
understanding of
these markets.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.800
I think they're fascinating.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.350
Most people apparently don't,
because you don't hear them

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.600
brought up very much.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.200
I want to just say a little
bit more about hostility

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:03.000
toward derivative markets
and futures markets, and

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.870
speculation in general.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:10.360
In 1991, that was 20 years
ago, I wrote a joint

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.940
paper with a --

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.850
I don't remember whether
I mentioned this,

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.160
probably not --

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:19.570
with a Russian, a young man from
Russia that I met when I

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:23.380
was visiting the Soviet Union,
just before the end of the

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.600
Soviet Union.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.690
And we were talking about how
antagonistic Russians are

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.830
toward capitalism.

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.010
And he said, this is
a big problem.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:37.080
Russia just can't embrace
capitalism.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.510
These people hate it.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:42.510
They hate the profit makers
and the financiers.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.480
And I said to him, well, you
know, it's the same in the

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.320
U.S. How do you know it's
any worse in Russia?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.950
And so, we decided to do
a questionnaire survey.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.640
And I was going to read one of
the questions, comparing

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:58.830
people in Moscow and people in
New York, to see, which one

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.940
understands capitalism better.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.220
So, one of the questions that
we had was the following --

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:07.952
We wrote these questions and
translated them into Russian.

00:10:07.952 --> 00:10:10.780
And we tried to make them
exactly the same questions

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.110
between Russian and English.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.890
So, here's the question we asked
in both cities: ''Grain

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.800
traders in capitalist countries
sometimes hold grain

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.060
without selling it, putting
it in temporary storage in

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:28.410
anticipation of higher
prices later.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.790
Do you think this speculation
will cause more frequent

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.920
shortages of flour, bread and
other grain products?

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.450
Or will it cause such shortages
to become rarer?''

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:42.250
What do you think,
people said?

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:46.190
Does the process of speculating
in grain cause

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.640
problems or solve problems?

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:56.000
Well, we found that, in the
USA, 66% said it will make

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.990
shortages more common.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:03.540
But in the Soviet Union, in
Moscow, only 45% thought it

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.830
would make shortages
more common.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.670
Both of them were wrong.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:12.130
A lot of them were wrong, but
the Russians were better,

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.590
closer to the truth than
the Americans.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.110
Living in the financial capital
of the USA, most

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.040
people think that speculating in
grain creates problems. But

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.480
wait a minute, what is
speculation in grain?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.880
That means holding it off,
expecting higher

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.000
prices later, right?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.630
Isn't that what you have
to do if you are

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.920
managing a grain market?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.870
Now, think of it this way
-- and I'm coming now to

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.610
agricultural futures.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.020
In the simplest world,
there's one harvest

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.130
of wheat every year.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.300
And that harvest comes in a
certain time of the year,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.280
every year.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:50.870
Once a year.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:55.170
And it has to be held in storage
over the year, right?

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.150
Because people don't
eat it all at once.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.010
You eat it over the
whole year.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.390
So, somebody is storing grain.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.530
This is a fundamental problem.

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.290
That's a business.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.400
So, you have to know that
somewhere there's some

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.490
warehouse holding the grain that
you will be consuming in

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.210
six months time.

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:14.930
And that warehouse
is run by some

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:19.550
professionals who do that.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:22.710
If they think prices are higher
later, they'll keep it

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.550
longer in the warehouse.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.960
And what does that do?

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.840
That evens out the price.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.440
It doesn't make it worse.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.570
If they think there's going to
be a shortage of grain, they

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:35.410
hold it back now and the
price of grain goes up.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:37.380
And so, everyone starts
consuming a little less

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.090
because of the higher price, and
it smoothes things out and

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.910
it works better.

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.010
And this is elementary
economics, but it's not

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:47.050
understood, I think,
by most people.

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:55.600
And the futures markets are
just sophisticated markets

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.540
that help that process.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.950
So, I'm going to start with
agricultural futures in

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.070
talking about this.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:06.420
And I want to start also with
a very homely -- it's not

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.170
homely -- it's a very elementary
example, because

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.870
it's the first futures market.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.745
So, where do you think futures
markets started?

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.640
You would think, it started in
New York, or Chicago, or

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.266
London, or Paris.

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:30.640
It actually started in Japan
in a place called Dojima,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.400
which is in the city of Osaka.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:45.260
And they started in the 1600s.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.460
So, let's go back.

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:53.970
If we can go back to the year
1673, in Osaka in Japan.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.360
Japan was heavily dependent
on rice.

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.900
And the rice farmers would farm
all over Japan, but there

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.950
was a rice market in Dojima,
which was the

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:06.620
national rice market.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.260
And I have data here.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.790
According to a study, there
were 91 rice warehouses in

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.230
Dojima in 1673.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.950
That's a long time
ago, isn't it?

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.590
So, it was a big storage place
for rice, and they were

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:23.850
storing it all year.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.750
And people would come, people
who were merchants for rice,

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.570
and they would come to Dojima
and they would sign contracts

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.270
to get rice.

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.240
I live in some town
20 miles from

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.860
here, I'm a rice merchant.

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.150
I need a regular supply of
rice from your warehouse.

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:43.230
Can you supply it to me?

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.830
And the guy would give you a
terms, and that would be a

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.550
forward contract.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.960
And this is what was happening
before the futures market.

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.960
Forward contracts precede
futures contracts.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.720
So, do you see what it is?

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.590
You're a rice merchant.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:59.260
You make a deal.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:04.150
You sign a contract that I
will pay you so much in

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:07.800
currency at every month, and
you'll give me so much rice.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.100
And you'll deliver it here,
and I'll take it, and I'll

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.350
sell it in my town.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.830
Problems developed in the
forward market that led to the

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.690
development of a
futures market.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.450
And the problem is, one of the
problems is that there's

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:28.530
counterparty risk.

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.050
You are a rice merchant.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.700
You make a deal with
a warehouse.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.140
That's one person dealing
with one person, right?

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.570
What if one of the guys
reneges on the deal?

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.600
So, for example, what if the
price of rice falls?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.660
Then you, the merchant, will
say, I'm not going to go back

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.420
and buy according to this
contract, because

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:51.910
it's cheaper now.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.610
I'll buy it somewhere else.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.370
So, I just don't show up, and
then the warehouse is saying,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.210
what happened to our contract?

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.490
And you're nowhere
to be found.

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.890
Or if it goes the other way, if
rice goes up, the warehouse

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.250
might renege.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.900
They'd say, we signed this
contract but there's something

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.460
wrong with it, and we're
not going to honor it.

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.220
So, it messes up.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:18.650
It is also possible that one of
the two counterparties is

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.530
just a sociopath or something,
or is an alcoholic, or

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:24.110
something is wrong.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:25.420
So, the market doesn't
work well.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.500
So, what they invented in
Japan was the first true

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.740
futures market.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.750
And the market worked like
this: There was a trading

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.840
floor in Dojima.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.060
And rice traders would come
there, and there were certain

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.750
hours of the day, when you
would trade contracts for

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.710
future delivery.

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.829
But they were standardized
contracts, mediated by the

00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:53.800
exchange, so that there
would be no

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.260
problem with the contract.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:02.310
And then every day, there would
be a trading time, and

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:07.800
you could buy and sell contracts
for future delivery.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.750
Moreover, they enforced
trading hours.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.615
And this is something
that's kind of

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:15.340
an interesting invention.

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:17.860
They didn't have --

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:18.840
I guess they didn't
have clocks.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:20.050
I don't know what they had.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.000
But they had a certain time,
when trading would stop, and

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.370
they wanted to stop all the
trading at the same time.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:26.720
They didn't want people
dribbling out.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.990
They wanted it to be
a good market.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.070
So, they would light a fuse, and
it would be a bright light

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:35.640
in the middle of the
trading floor.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:38.550
And you'd see the fuse burning
down, and when it burned out,

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.220
all trading stopped.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.220
So, they had trading hours.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:44.930
Moreover, they had a problem
that some of the traders

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.470
wouldn't stop trading.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.860
So, this is something that they
did in Dojima, they had

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.910
men called watermen, who came
out with buckets of water.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.720
And they would throw the buckets
of water on anyone who

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.200
was still trading.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.250
So that worked.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.640
It stopped trading.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.250
They also had hand signals.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.930
This was big.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:05.630
This is big time.

00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:08.130
You were trading rice
for all of Japan.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.570
And you may think the 16- or
1700s are long ago, but a lot

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.910
of rice was traded and it got
really noisy and difficult.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.800
They found that it was so many
people trading on the floor,

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.995
that you couldn't hear
anyone talk.

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:25.990
And there'd be shouting and
it was noisy, and so, they

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.530
devised a system of
hand signals.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.150
And the Dojima hand signals
were, I don't know exactly,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.330
but something like this.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.090
If your hand was out,
you put your hand

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:36.642
out, that means sell.

00:18:36.642 --> 00:18:39.430
You put your hand this
way, it meant buy.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.770
And if you put three fingers
up, it means

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.830
selling three contracts.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.310
That kind of thing.

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:49.700
I don't know the whole system,
but that's where it started.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.250
That whole concept was copied
all over the world in

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:55.210
subsequent centuries.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:56.700
So, what is it that happened?

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.790
And the other thing is, what
were the contracts that you

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.540
bought and sold?

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.940
The problem with the forward
market is that the contracts

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.770
are all different.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:09.080
One guy made a contract with one
guy, and he said, I want

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:10.230
my delivery here.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.820
And I don't like this
kind of rice.

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.820
I want this kind.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:17.070
And you better make sure that
there's not a single insect in

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.720
it, or I'm going to reject
the whole thing.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.180
But that's all different.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.750
So, you don't know what --

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.380
these contracts, you don't
even know what the

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:28.660
price of rice is.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.030
If someone said, I paid
so much to get rice

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.960
in the future --

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.925
but you have to say, well,
under what circumstances?

00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:38.360
And what kind of rice?

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:39.060
And where?

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.660
And what are the terms
for possible failure?

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.140
You know, there's so many terms
in the contract, so you

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.570
don't even know what the
price of rice is.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.350
But at the futures market, they

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.620
standardized the contract.

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.390
So, it may not be exactly
what you want, but it's

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:56.630
standardized.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.300
So, you deliver rice --

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.800
I don't know all the details
of Dojima, but I'm talking

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.770
about futures markets,
as they evolve.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.580
In a modern futures market,
agricultural futures market,

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.520
you deliver your --

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:16.130
the contract is to deliver some
commodity like rice at a

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:21.230
specified future date, at a
specified future warehouse,

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:23.470
which would be run
by the exchange.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:26.025
And there's inspectors
at the warehouse who

00:20:26.025 --> 00:20:27.930
are expert on grain.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.740
And they verify, because
they know rice.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.860
They know it really well.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.900
And they know that some
rice has bugs in it.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.215
They know how to find out.

00:20:36.215 --> 00:20:37.470
They have a standard.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:40.270
Of course, there can always be
some bugs in it, but they have

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.060
a standard and they have
a way of measuring,

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.520
and they get it right.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.200
And so, all those contracts
are exactly the same.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:55.500
And so, they become the price.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.190
It turns out, funny thing, the
futures market almost becomes

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:02.870
the real market, because they're
all standardized.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:04.330
The futures price --

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.510
You know where it's delivered.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.900
You know what's delivered,
exactly.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:14.360
The futures market becomes
the market, in a sense.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.190
The fact that it's in the future
is, in effect, a help,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.870
because since it's a comfortable
time in the

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.810
future, it's well defined.

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:26.330
Whereas the spot market --

00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:30.270
the spot market is the market
for rice, or whatever it is,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:33.090
today as it's traded.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.950
The spot market is
inscrutable.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:36.590
It's hard to understand.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.220
So, let's think about a farmer
today, who grows rice, or

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.260
wheat, or soybeans,
or something.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.740
If you drive through farming
countries, listen to the

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.720
radio, regularly they'll
give prices.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.960
Soybeans, wheat, rice,
et cetera.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.910
Why do they give that?

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.020
Because farmers care.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.940
They're raising this stuff.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.170
It's their whole livelihood,
whether they make a profit or

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:57.620
not, depends on it.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.240
What prices do they quote?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.200
They quote the futures
prices, even though

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.420
they're in the future.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.320
But they quote them, because
they mean something and

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.250
they're standardized.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.810
So, that's why the
futures market

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.630
becomes the central market.

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:17.240
I want to just say something
about futures --

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.980
Japan started the futures
markets in the 1600s, and they

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.610
were the world leader in rice
futures until 1939.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:30.080
And then, at World War II, the
Japanese government shut the

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:31.790
futures market down.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.350
And to this day since,
there is no rice

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:35.900
futures market in Japan.

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:37.250
Believe it or not.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.490
The inventors, they're talking
now of starting it up again.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.030
Where do they trade
rice futures?

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:47.460
Well, the USA is the main
market, even though you don't

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:55.300
think of the U.S. as
a market for rice.

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.330
But the point is, that markets
have to be centralized.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:23:00.340
And that people want the
centralized market, and if it

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.330
happens to be in Chicago,
so be it.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.850
So, it becomes a huge
international rice market.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.610
And so, I looked up --

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:12.560
this is called Rough Rice
Futures, and this is the

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:15.510
futures curve as
of last Friday

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.650
[addition: March 18, 2011].

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.670
So, what we have is different
delivery months.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:25.020
This is May of this year.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:27.040
And then, there's other delivery
months, and then

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:27.800
there's next year.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:33.030
It goes out about a year,
different delivery dates.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:36.230
And this is cents
per 100 weight.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:38.270
100 weight is 100
pounds of rice.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.585
And since this is USA, we mean
100 U.S. pounds of rice.

00:23:43.585 --> 00:23:46.340
But anyone in the world can
figure this out and trade in

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.160
this market.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.850
And it's in dollars, because
it's what we're

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.035
trading in the USA.

00:23:50.035 --> 00:23:54.200
So, someone in Japan, who wants
to trade in the futures

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.300
market, has to come to the USA,
change their yen into

00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.960
dollars, and do this.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.670
Now, you see that the futures
price is going up.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:08.080
This was all quoted
last Friday

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.400
[addition: March 18, 2011].

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.340
This is the market, essentially,
right now.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.840
But you see, it's a futures
market, because it's giving

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.775
prices of rice at dates
in the future.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:25.290
These prices way out here,
next year, are not so

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:27.500
reliable, because there's
not much trade.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:30.590
The trade tends to dominate
at the front months.

00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:32.350
So, here's where most
of the trade is.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:35.890
They're trading May, and
maybe this is July.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:38.635
I forgot exactly.

00:24:38.635 --> 00:24:40.620
Is that clear, what
this means?

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.900
It's going up.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.240
And it's going up pretty
fast, isn't it?

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.230
From about less than
$0.13 to $0.15.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.000
What this means is that, in
effect, the market is

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.290
expecting huge increases
in the price of rice.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:00.640
So, that's interesting.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:04.810
Anyone who's doing business in
rice looks at this and says,

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:09.220
look, there's price increases
anticipated.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.540
Now, I just want to talk about
the world at this point in

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.660
history, and try to interpret
this curve.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:18.470
You must have heard that there
is a food shortage in the

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.950
world developing.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.480
And it's a source of crisis.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.650
It's developing in
the Middle East.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.100
One reason why that's been given
for the revolutions that

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.390
have happened in the
Middle East are,

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:36.180
that people are hungry.

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.570
There's dissatisfaction when
the price of food goes up.

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.850
A lot of people are living much
more at the margin than

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.040
you'd imagine.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.700
So, this increase in rice
prices matters a lot.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.170
So, it's very interesting that
it's showing this steep

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:53.950
increase in the price of rice.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:00.030
But the first thing you want to
think of as a financier is

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.090
how much is this going up?

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:02.205
I didn't actually do
the calculation.

00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:05.080
It goes up from 14 --

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.420
under 13.75 to 15.5.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:11.150
That's quite an increase
in six months, right?

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:14.850
So, it sounds like there's a
profit opportunity here.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.810
Buy rice today and sell it
on the futures market.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.135
This is a good time
to sell it.

00:26:22.135 --> 00:26:25.490
I'll sell it in 2012.

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:29.010
And that's my futures profit.

00:26:29.010 --> 00:26:31.340
I can lock in this price today,
because that's what the

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.190
futures market does.

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:37.770
The contract is a contract to
deliver rice as of that future

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.460
date, and this would
be in Chicago, OK?

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:45.970
And so, I could make a profit.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:50.600
This is a very professional
market with real expertise.

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.350
You talk to the rice traders
or the wheat traders, they

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.120
know what they're doing.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.080
Believe me, they know
what they're doing.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.120
We're looking at this
for the first time.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.920
People who trade this
all their lives --

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.090
And if you ask, why is it?

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:07.790
Look how much it's going up,
this is a big profit

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.600
opportunity.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.090
They'll tell you,
why it isn't.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.620
Why it isn't such an opportunity
as you think.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:18.110
There must be some reason, why
I can't make huge money by

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:19.720
trading in rice, because
otherwise other

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.370
people would do it.

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:23.850
This is such a liquid
market, open to

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:25.020
everybody in the world.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.320
So, somebody's going to take
advantage of this.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:33.070
You understand, this is futures
prices quoted as of a

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.950
single date, for various
horizons in the future.

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:37.450
Don't get confused by it.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.190
This is not a plot
through time.

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.160
This is now.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.110
This is what's quoted now.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.660
And so, when you have an upward
slope in futures curve

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.100
like that, we call
that contango.

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:57.490
And that is what we usually see,
maybe not upward sloping

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.640
so much as this.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:05.910
The opposite is called
backwardation, if futures

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.570
prices are declining
through time.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.460
That happens, and I'll show
you that in a minute.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.850
But it's not happening
in rice.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:19.440
So, not happening now in rice.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.000
It must be that there's
something that prevents you

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.960
from just making a killing by
buying rice and selling it on

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.640
the futures market.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.830
Do you understand,
this is riskless?

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:31.860
If I sign a contract to sell
rice in Chicago on the futures

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.864
market, that is riskless
[addition: only if I own the

00:28:33.864 --> 00:28:34.450
underlying commodity].

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.650
And so, why don't
I just do that?

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.660
I think that there
must be some --

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.570
in some level, there must be
some storage cost problem.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.160
In order to actually do this,
you'd have to buy the rice and

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.780
store it for six months.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:52.460
And I'm thinking, that
must explain it.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.140
It must be that at this point in
time, storage costs are, in

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.430
some sense, too high for this
to be a real profit

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:01.750
opportunity.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.230
So, this is what happens
now in the real world.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:08.970
There are people
who store rice.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.340
There has to be, right?

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.460
I think, rice comes in more
than one harvest, because

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.680
there's different kinds, but
there's no more than a few

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.880
harvests in the year.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.990
And some of them are
bigger than others.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:21.760
And so, it's got to be stored.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:24.220
And this really, really matters,
because if it's not

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.650
stored, some people are going
to starve to death.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.460
So, it really matters.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.400
And you have professional
warehouse operators, who --

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.960
they sure do know what
this curve says.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.640
And they're thinking, right now,
I'm sure lots of people

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.300
looked at this curve yesterday,
and they thought,

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.440
look at that contango, wow.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.470
I'm going to see if I can get
some other warehouse.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.510
Can I get another one?

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.460
There's an empty building on
the south side of Chicago,

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.480
maybe I can fill it
up with rice.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.700
And so, I have to look up, and I
have to get inspections, and

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.020
sanity checks --

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:58.580
sanitation checks.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.620
And think about insurance.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.540
And they're thinking
about that.

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:05.220
But, you know, they find out
that it's not going to work,

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:06.880
and they're trying.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.560
This generates, when you have
a lot of contango on the

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:15.140
market, it generates
enthusiastic efforts by smart

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:17.900
people to try to store
more rice.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.170
And you see, what
that's doing.

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.490
It's helping prevent a famine.

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.610
And this goes back to --

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.500
I know, I'm putting it
in dramatic terms --

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.420
but this goes back to Adam
Smith, who in his Wealth of

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:34.080
Nations in 1776, has a famous
passage, which I can't quote

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.730
exactly, but it was something to
the effect that, you know,

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:41.690
there's a lot of people who
express benevolent impulses.

00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:45.030
They give to charity.

00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:47.500
They go to church regularly, and
they talk about ''love thy

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.600
neighbor.'' But they're not
doing a single thing to

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:51.880
prevent the next famine.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.370
They're not thinking about it.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.880
The people who are really
effective are these quiet guys

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.690
dealing in the markets.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:02.730
And they see a contango, and
they see something coming.

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.540
And so, they get in the
business of storing.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.850
And it's purely out of self
interest. So, the famous quote

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:12.430
that is quoted a million times
from Adam Smith is, these

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.850
people operating in their own
self interest seem to be more

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.720
important in promoting human
welfare than all the

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.320
benevolent people combined.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.730
I'm quoting him roughly.

00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.360
Well, there has to be an element
of truth to that.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:31.320
You know, people who do these
storages of grains do not get

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.190
much respect.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.420
And at dinner conversations,
nobody cares what they do.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.540
They're really good at
what they do, and

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.790
they know this market.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.620
And, you know, they're
not saints, either.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.920
They're speculators.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.260
They're trying to
make a profit.

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:55.000
Now, one thing I wanted to say
about futures also, which I

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.030
didn't really clearly --

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:03.270
in forward markets, which are
markets between a pair of

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:07.540
counterparties, there's always
counterparty risk.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.800
I'll write that.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.060
That means, you've
got a contract.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.310
You had a lawyer.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.960
A lawyer wrote up the terms.
You can take this guy to

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.960
bankruptcy court or something,
but that's all a nuisance and

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.090
it costs money.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.800
You never know.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:28.690
Futures markets get rid of
counterparty risk, or

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.400
essentially get rid of it.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.190
And how do they do that?

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:39.000
The system is a standardized
retail market that anyone can

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.535
play in, but you have
to post margin --

00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:47.370
and that's the idea,
margin, when you

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.220
either buy or sell futures.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.660
OK, so this is what happened.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:55.110
This is what a futures
contract looks like.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.230
You can do this.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:57.580
I don't know what would happen,
if you called up a

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:03.830
broker at your age, but
essentially you can do this.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.380
I know, Jeremy Siegel, my
friend, said, he would

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.000
actually lend money to
students and let

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.220
them play the markets.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.680
His own money.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.300
I have never done that, so
don't ask me to do that.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.750
But you can basically call
up a broker and say, I'm

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.420
interested in rice futures.

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:23.590
It sounds like fun to me.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:25.630
I'd like to play that game.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.470
So, the broker would
say, fine, I'll

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:29.790
open a margin account.

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.140
How much money are you
going to put in?

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:33.030
All right.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:35.790
The first question is, money.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:40.490
He doesn't know who you
are, but money talks.

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.040
So, you say, all right --

00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.430
you have to come up with
some money to do this.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.560
Let's say, I'll put in
$5,000 into a futures

00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.540
account at your brokerage.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.580
And he would then say, OK.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.940
Now, you have $5,000.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.699
And the margin requirement for
rice futures, I don't remember

00:33:57.699 --> 00:34:01.630
what it is, say it's something
like 3% or 5%.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.210
You can buy or sell up to the
limits imposed by your margin.

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.570
Your margin has to be whatever
percent of the

00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:10.065
contract that you sign.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:17.560
You're only putting up $5,000,
I'll let you buy and sell

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.530
$100,000 worth of rice.

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.360
So, this would happen.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.570
You say, OK, I want to buy --

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.964
what do I want?

00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:27.530
What do I want to do?

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:29.800
I'm going to store rice, and
then I want to sell it.

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.000
So, I want to sell futures.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.850
It doesn't matter, whether
you buy or sell.

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.060
Either way, you've got
to put up money.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:41.220
Let say, I'm going to do this
rice storage business.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.930
I can do it.

00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:44.310
It's open to anybody
in the world.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.580
I can find a warehouse.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.570
I can buy some rice.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.960
I can store it.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.390
And I can sell it
at that price.

00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:51.260
So, I want to sell futures.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.160
I can sell $100,000, even
though I've only

00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.450
got $5,000 put up.

00:34:56.450 --> 00:34:58.300
But then, you know
what happens.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.510
Every day, they look
at the change --

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.080
the futures price is the price
on that contract today, but

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.710
it's not a price that
you pay today.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.500
You would pay it at the end,
effectively, when the

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:10.850
contract comes due.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:13.840
Or in the case of selling,
you'd be receiving it.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:19.030
So, if I sell futures for, say,
May of 2012, then I am

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:22.990
promising to deliver rice to
the warehouse in Chicago on

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:29.050
that date in 2012, and
take the price.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:34.210
OK, but now, the futures price
today is the price that the

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:36.510
market has today.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.370
Tomorrow, the futures price
will be different.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.260
And so, what they have in the
futures markets is daily

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.380
settlement.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.960
And that means that if
I sold futures --

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.960
I'm storing rice and
selling futures --

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.405
if the price goes down --

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.470
I'm sorry, if the
price goes up --

00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:03.330
it works against me,
because I've locked

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:04.910
in the lower price.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.270
So, the broker debits my margin
account by the daily --

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.670
every day they change
my margin account.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:15.040
So, if I've sold futures and the
price goes up, they take

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.600
it out of my margin account.

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.850
If the price goes down, they put
it into my margin account.

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:24.550
And I can quickly deplete
my $5,000.

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:26.280
The post price keeps going up.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.670
Then I say, gee, I wish I hadn't
signed that contract,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:31.970
because I could have waited
a few days and

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:33.310
gotten a better price.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.630
Meanwhile, the broker calls you
on the phone and says, I'm

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:39.460
sorry, your margin account
is almost depleted.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.055
Do you want to put
up more margin?

00:36:41.055 --> 00:36:44.400
And this is where you get the
reality of futures trading.

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.900
Because there's no counterparty
risk.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:51.600
That means, that if you don't
put up more margin, the broker

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:53.960
closes you out and says,
here's your money.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:55.770
Do you understand how
this works now?

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.510
So, there's no counterparty
risk, because it doesn't

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:01.890
matter, whether you're a drunk
or a sociopath, the broker has

00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:02.930
you trading.

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.600
And it doesn't matter
at all what you do.

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.830
Once you put up the money, and
if you just don't answer the

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.840
phone -- if you, say you don't
answer the phone, the broker

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.970
will close you out, when
the margin is depleted.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.290
So, the broker takes no risk.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:21.010
The counterparty is not
even given to you.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:23.290
You don't even know, who's
on the other side of that

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:26.190
contract, because the other
side is making --

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:30.160
you're both making a contract
with the exchange.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.430
And so, you don't care about
counterparty risk, and there's

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:35.520
no risk to this contract.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:40.180
That means, these prices are
pure prices, and they don't

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:43.040
have any counterparty risk.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.360
I wanted to show you another
futures contract.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:05.430
This is Soft Red Winter Wheat,
which is a major crop in the

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:12.310
U.S. Winter wheat, you
plant it in the fall.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:14.860
Believe it or not, some people
are surprised to hear this.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.100
You plant it in the fall, and
then it stays in the ground

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:19.980
over all the winter, and
it comes up really

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:22.180
early in the spring.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:30.880
And then, it's harvested
in early summer.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.700
And the Soft Red Winter Wheat is
very good for biscuits, and

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:40.140
cold cereal, and cakes, but
not so good for bread.

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:45.000
So, it's a particular kind
of wheat that is grown.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.447
So, this is the futures
curve, as of Friday

00:38:49.447 --> 00:38:49.890
[addition: March 18, 2011],

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:51.310
for this.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.130
And this is in cents
per bushel.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:58.640
So, this is the front month
future, and it's --

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:04.475
it looks like it's 723 cents,
$7.23 a bushel.

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:09.420
And now, we see this sharp
contango again, and the prices

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.570
are going up really rapidly
through time.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.990
Again, this is all prices
quoted last Friday.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:19.580
This is futures contracts and
different maturities.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:25.610
And then, you see sometime
around summer of 2012, it

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:28.375
loses contango, and it becomes,
actually, declining.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.990
And then, this market goes
out to 2013, and stops.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.820
That's as far out as
they trade futures.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:42.320
So, why is it declining
in 2012?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:45.040
Well, there's probably a
million factors in it.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.880
You need to talk to
a futures expert.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.430
But I think, one thing that
comes to my mind, is the

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:55.120
harvest. And so, they
harvest grain

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.450
sometime around that time.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.420
You know, you shouldn't be
storing grain at the harvest.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.250
This contango is a compensation

00:40:04.250 --> 00:40:05.920
for the cost of storage.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:11.980
So, you shouldn't be storing
grain in the harvest time.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:15.630
You should be clearing out your
warehouses, and sweeping

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.850
them out, and cleaning them up,
and waiting for the new

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.510
harvest to come in.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.590
So, you don't expect contango
to continue.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:24.420
There's a seasonal --

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:25.520
it's not so clear here.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.170
It's not dropping very much.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.590
I don't know, there's
many factors that

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:33.380
determine these prices.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:39.100
But I wanted to just give
a little bit of simple

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.640
mathematics about
futures pricing.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:57.370
The basic formula is that --

00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:01.790
you have to think of futures
markets as storage markets.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:14.320
And the basic equation is, that
the price of any futures

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:18.580
contract, p sub f, is the
futures price on one of those

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:27.380
dates, is equal to 1 plus r,
plus s, times the spot price.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.420
Where the spot price,
p sub s --

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:37.240
I'll write it out, p spot,
is the price today.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.240
Now, this is kind of
theoretical, because I just

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.940
told you, nobody ever knows
what the price today is

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.990
anyway, because the only way
you ever know prices is

00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:46.030
through futures markets.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.670
But let's just think a little
bit abstractly.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:51.570
Say, there's a cash market
for wheat, that it's

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:52.410
bought and sold with.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:56.540
And we know what the price
is on that market.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:03.420
So, this is the interest
rate between now --

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.620
it's not the annual
interest rate.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:10.880
It's the total interest as a
percent between now and the

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.130
maturity of the contract.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.920
So, if it's one year and
the interest rate is

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.580
5%, then r is 0.05.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.100
But if it's one and a half
years, it's going to be more

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.980
like 0.075, because the total
interest between now and one

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:33.700
and a half years in the
future is 7.5%.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:41.730
And s is the storage cost.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:46.885
So, this is called fair value,
and what it means is, normally

00:42:46.885 --> 00:42:50.220
you think futures prices should
behave like that.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:59.660
So, the normal situation in
futures markets is contango,

00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:04.150
which means that prices are
normally going up through

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:10.070
time, because the longer in the
future we're looking at,

00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:14.550
the longer time that we're
losing interest and storage.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.850
See what this really is, this
fair value equation, is just

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:21.980
the equation that defines, when
it is that there's just

00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:25.540
no profit to storing grain.

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.480
There's only a normal
profit, right?

00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:28.720
If people who do it --

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:30.355
This equation can't
hold exactly.

00:43:30.355 --> 00:43:33.750
Or if it held exactly, then no
one would store grain, but it

00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:36.470
has to be approximately
valuable.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.700
So, do you see?

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.490
How else do I say this?

00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:46.890
It shows that normally the
futures price is above the

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:48.450
spot price.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.580
And as time goes on --

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:54.250
I don't mean time in this sense,
I mean calendar time --

00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:57.810
the futures price will converge
on the spot price,

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.040
because the interest rate, the
horizon for the interest rate

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.315
and the storage costs --

00:44:03.315 --> 00:44:08.010
this is in percent, and
this is in percent --

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:08.390
goes down.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.014
So, let me just clarify that.

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:17.830
Let's talk about a perfect
world, where there's no

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:22.190
harvest uncertainty, nothing
happens except the crop is

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:23.280
normally produced.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.290
And it's wheat.

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.520
And let's say --

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.540
I'm going to do a plot.

00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:30.390
And this is time.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.820
This is calendar time,
not maturity time

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.720
like on this plot.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.330
And this is the price of --

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.550
I'm going to plot the
price of wheat.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:44.530
Now, what does wheat
do over the year?

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.470
It has a seasonal pattern.

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.840
I'm going to do an abstract
form of seasonal.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.700
This is what the price
of wheat does.

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.410
And this is a year.

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:58.990
This is year 1, this is year
2, this is year 3, year 4.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:05.670
This is the price of wheat
in each of these years.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.510
It falls every harvest
time, right?

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.960
It has to be rising until
harvest, because somebody has

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.910
to be storing grain.

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.430
And the price has to go
up, because they're

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:16.660
facing storage costs.

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:23.010
And then, every spring, every
harvest time, it collapses.

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:24.290
And it does it again
every year.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.640
No uncertainty.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.170
What do futures prices do?

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:31.290
Well, let's consider a futures
market that's --

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.580
a futures contract that has a
maturity right here at the

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:39.110
peak, just before the harvest.
But if there were no

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:43.030
uncertainty, the futures price
would just be constant

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:46.190
throughout that whole time.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.490
It would always equal the
expected spot price on that

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.740
future date.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.750
And again, it would repeat
the next year.

00:45:57.750 --> 00:46:00.520
Futures contracts have no
expected price change in this

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:01.770
perfect world.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:07.560
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:10.950
This equation always holds,
because, as this contract

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:16.120
matures, the time to the
expiration date goes down.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.005
And so, this r goes down,
and s goes down.

00:46:19.005 --> 00:46:22.010
And eventually, it hits 0
on the expiration date.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:24.700
And the futures price equals
the spot price on the

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:26.700
expiration date.

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:30.395
But in reality, we don't see
such a nice and perfect match.

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:38.190
I want to talk about another
futures market, which is maybe

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.260
the most important futures
market of all.

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:44.790
I've been talking just about
agricultural futures.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:48.850
Agricultural futures are the
origins of futures markets.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:52.780
And I like to talk about them,
because I like to imagine --

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.250
well, our ancestors all lived
on farms, once in the past.

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:00.470
And it just seems like such
a family story that we all

00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:02.430
should know about farming.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.270
It's our history.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.310
But now let's move forward
into other classes --

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:12.060
we can have futures markets
for oil as well.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.410
So, this is last Friday's
[addition: March 18, 2011]

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.890
futures curve for Light
Sweet Crude Oil.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.720
This used to be at the New York
Mercantile Exchange, but

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.760
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
has been buying

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.850
everybody up.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:26.260
And now, it's the CME.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:29.420
They call it the CME group,
actually, Chicago Mercantile

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:30.820
Exchange Group.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:33.370
And this is the price of oil.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.350
Look, what's happening here.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:38.150
Isn't this something,
this curve?

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:42.320
The price of oil as of last
Friday, on the nearest month

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.090
future, was selling
at $101 a barrel.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.170
It's gone up a lot.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:49.470
This is part of the crisis
now around the world.

00:47:49.470 --> 00:47:52.050
People need food and
they need oil.

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.750
Incidentally, the two markets
are related, because we can

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:56.630
turn fuel --

00:47:56.630 --> 00:48:00.960
we can create fuel from food
by using grains to produce

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.260
ethanol, and that substitutes
for oil.

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.730
So, it's not independent.

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:06.490
These two markets are
not independent.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:08.550
Now, oil is so important.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.490
It's the energy that drives
the world economy.

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:16.690
And any events, like the recent
earthquake in Japan and

00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:21.270
the nuclear disaster in Japan,
it affects this market.

00:48:21.270 --> 00:48:22.940
Everyone's thinking, what
does it mean for oil?

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.320
Maybe, we won't have so many
nuclear plants anymore, so

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.050
that's going to mean, oil's
going to go up.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.340
The other thing that's happening
is, at this point in

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.020
history, there's a crisis in
the Middle East, and it's

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.220
cutting off the flow of oil.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.990
So, people are trying to
predict it, and those

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.850
predictions come into
this market.

00:48:44.850 --> 00:48:46.270
So, here's what we see.

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:50.435
We see right now, the market is
predicting increases of oil

00:48:50.435 --> 00:48:56.330
until December, and then, a
collapse of oil prices,

00:48:56.330 --> 00:48:59.190
bottoming out in January
of 2015.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:03.680
This market goes all the
way out to almost 2020.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.810
That's a long time.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:08.600
That's because it's such
an important commodity.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:14.320
So, this futures curve
matters for --

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:17.410
The total value of oil in the
ground in the world is

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:19.720
probably over $100 trillion.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.830
It's bigger than the GDP of
just about any country.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:24.860
It's huge and important.

00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:29.480
And people who are thinking of
extracting their oil, they're

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.970
looking at -- everyone's
looking at this curve.

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:34.290
So, why does it peak
in December

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:36.530
2011, and then collapse?

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:39.680
I'm guessing that has something
to do with the

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:41.960
crisis in the Middle East, that
the people who trade in

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.940
these markets are thinking, that
the crisis will be over

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:49.490
by then and prices will
start coming down.

00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:53.090
So, we're seeing contango here,
and backwardation here.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:55.910
I'm using a simple definition of
contango and backwardation.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:58.140
There's more subtle
definitions, but

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:59.200
we'll keep it simple.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:03.993
We're seeing an increase,
expected in oil prices, and

00:50:03.993 --> 00:50:04.760
then it decreases.

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.730
And then, it has it
going up again.

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:08.770
Is this right?

00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:10.650
Well, if it isn't right,
there's a profit

00:50:10.650 --> 00:50:11.800
opportunity for you.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.080
If you know better, you can get
in and you can do it with,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:17.810
I think, all you need is
something like $5,000.

00:50:17.810 --> 00:50:20.590
I'm not trying to entice you
to trade this, but I'm just

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:22.600
trying to give the idea
of what these

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:24.090
markets really mean.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:30.110
That the oil, it means
survival for people.

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.650
I mean, oil and food are what
keeps people going and alive.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.640
And there's not enough.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.640
There's not enough
for everybody.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:43.670
And so, this market is all about
extracting oil at a good

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:48.350
rate, thinking about when
to sell it, so that it,

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.205
ultimately, I think, serves
the purpose of humanity.

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:58.370
Now, incidentally, what's
happening here?

00:50:58.370 --> 00:51:03.750
When you see the curve falling,
how can that be?

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:07.140
I just wrote this equation here,
saying that the futures

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:11.390
price has to equal 1 plus r,
plus s, times the spot price.

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:13.450
So, the futures price
has to be greater

00:51:13.450 --> 00:51:14.270
than the spot price.

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.340
I just wrote that, right?

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.760
But you can see that this
futures price, this is

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.990
essentially the spot price.

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:23.030
This is the front month future,
and it's about to

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.910
expire, so it's converging.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:29.780
And this is what we call
the price of oil.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:33.920
When you hear oil prices quoted
on TV or on magazines,

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.550
they're quoting the front
month futures.

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.300
Let me be clear about that.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:43.210
Oil is mostly sold on
long-term contracts.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:46.410
So, just like our rice merchant,
buyers of oil are

00:51:46.410 --> 00:51:47.300
typically --

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.890
who buys crude oil?

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.390
It's some refinery.

00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:54.290
They've got a big operation
and they refine oil.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:58.040
And they care about, what
kind of oil do I get?

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.430
And when is it going
to be delivered?

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.050
And what are you going to
do for me, if it's not

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:03.100
delivered on time?

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.580
They have complicated
delivery contracts.

00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:07.950
Almost all oil is sold
through that.

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:09.680
So, what is the price of oil?

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.190
You can't figure it out.

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.425
There's just too many contracts

00:52:12.425 --> 00:52:14.750
and they're all different.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:18.530
There is a spot market for oil,
but that's just overflow.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:19.610
You know what happens?

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:20.800
There'll be some mistake.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:26.030
Someone delivered too much oil
to the New Haven harbor, or

00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:29.190
someone reneged on a contract,
now I've got this extra oil.

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:34.230
It goes on to the spot market,
but that market is tiny and is

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:36.460
not reliable.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.030
You don't know what kind of oil
it was, you know, it's all

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.280
different --

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:42.650
what the issues are.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.730
So, when you hear oil prices,
you're hearing futures prices.

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:48.500
So what's happening?

00:52:48.500 --> 00:52:54.260
How can it be that the futures
price in 2015 is lower than

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.500
the price today?

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.180
Well, there is something
funny going on.

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:00.280
I'll tell you one thing that
it does mean to me, is that

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:07.130
nobody is planning to store oil
between now and 2015, at

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:10.060
least not as a storage
business.

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.580
Because I'm going
to lose money.

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:16.490
I'm going to be selling at less,
unless I have negative

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:18.380
storage costs.

00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.700
I'm not going to store oil
between now and then.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:22.290
I'll store it for now.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.950
So, that means that people are
kind of trying to store a lot

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:29.040
of it now, because the contango
is there, but it's

00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.230
going to end in December, and
then they're going to empty

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.810
their storage tanks.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:37.240
That must be what storers
are thinking.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:39.060
So, this thing doesn't
always hold.

00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.923
This only holds when there's
commodity in storage.

00:53:43.923 --> 00:53:50.380
Or you could say, well, it still
holds even when you have

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:54.930
backwardation, because, in some
sense, storage costs can

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.030
get negative.

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:59.930
And so let me just talk about,
there's a term that they use

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:01.240
called convenience yield.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:12.420
When the futures curve is in
backwardation, somebody is

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.650
still going to be storing oil.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:19.050
So, suppose I have a factory,
and my factory depends on oil,

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:24.380
because I use it to burn, to
produce whatever we make.

00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:26.845
Am I going to let my warehouse,
my storage tank of

00:54:26.845 --> 00:54:28.380
oil go dry?

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.990
No, I'm going to need some,
just because we might need

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:35.240
more than we think.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.110
We might have a buffer stock.

00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.320
So, that means, I actually have
negative storage costs.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:41.570
I always want oil.

00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:44.180
I don't want ever to let
my tanks go dry.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.040
So, the only people who are
storing oil, when you have a

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.920
backwardated futures market,
are the people who want

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:53.810
convenience yield.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:55.660
Now, I'm omitting some
subtleties here.

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.910
I'm sorry, but I'm trying to
make the basic point, that

00:54:58.910 --> 00:55:03.050
this equation holds
when the commodity

00:55:03.050 --> 00:55:05.070
underlying is in storage.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:08.380
But it doesn't always hold.

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:11.840
So, now I wanted to talk about
oil a little bit more, because

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:14.540
it's so important.

00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.050
I have here the price of oil.

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:20.270
I like history.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:21.810
I like to give you
long history.

00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:27.820
I wanted to give you the price
of oil back to 1871.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:36.790
And this is, well, U.S. oil
price in U.S. dollars.

00:55:36.790 --> 00:55:40.060
But I've corrected for
inflation, so it's real oil

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:49.758
prices from 1871 until just a
short while ago, last week

00:55:49.758 --> 00:55:52.680
[addition: data ends
on March 18, 2011].

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:59.550
And now, in recent
years this is the

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.390
front month oil contract.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:07.140
The oil futures market started
in the 1970s, so this is all

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.750
the front month futures
contract.

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.980
Before that, this is someone's
guess as to what the price of

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:15.220
oil was, because there weren't
such well-developed markets.

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:23.110
We didn't have oil futures
until the 1970s.

00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:26.710
So, I wanted to think about what
was happening at these

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:28.640
various dates.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:33.130
These early swings in the 1870s
were due to discoveries

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:38.460
of oil, and discoveries
of uses for oil.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:42.070
Pennsylvania oil was discovered
somewhere around

00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:44.310
this time in the
United States.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.305
Texas oil was discovered
somewhere around this time in

00:56:47.305 --> 00:56:49.960
the United States.

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:53.630
Our economy wasn't so dependent
on petroleum.

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:56.670
Actually, if you look up ''oil''
on ProQuest, back in

00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:59.580
1870 they didn't even
call it oil.

00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:04.060
They called it petroleum,
because what was oil?

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:06.780
What did they think
oil was in 1870?

00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.400
Whale oil, OK.

00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.450
It was a different world.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:15.590
So, we see a lot of jumping
around of oil prices.

00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:24.540
But we see a big surge
going into the 1890s.

00:57:24.540 --> 00:57:26.830
And there was a big scandal
about Standard Oil.

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:27.410
Remember that?

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.460
And the government eventually
busted up

00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:32.200
Standard Oil as a monopoly.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:35.420
So, they were starting to
get concerned about oil.

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.230
But then, if you go forward in
time, you see this interesting

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.810
pattern here.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:40.590
What was going on here?

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:48.390
The price of oil became very
stable, until, bang, there was

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:52.610
this huge upswing in oil.

00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:55.150
Well, what was happening in
this interval of time?

00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.650
In the '40s to 60's, the U.S.
was a big producer of oil.

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:06.280
It kind of got started here, oil
production, with Drake's

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:10.190
invention of the oil rig.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:13.970
And the U.S. was the biggest
producer of oil.

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:17.790
And during this period, when you
see oil prices were very

00:58:17.790 --> 00:58:24.720
stable, the oil prices were
actually stabilized by the --

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:26.380
it was produced mostly
in Texas --

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:29.550
Texas Railroad Commission.

00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:35.350
It says railroad, but it was a
government agency in the state

00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:40.970
of Texas, which worked to
stabilize oil prices.

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:43.920
But during this period of time,
the U.S. was depleting

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.660
its oil, and other oil
discoveries were coming in.

00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:51.370
And so, this whole period --
this is before there were any

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:53.130
futures markets, because
there was no reason

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:54.740
for a futures market.

00:58:54.740 --> 00:58:57.430
Oil prices were very stable.

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:02.060
And then, you see, here, a
sudden jump up in oil prices.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:08.230
And this point right here is
called the first oil crisis.

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:14.340
So, the first oil crisis, it
kind of stands out on a

00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.190
diagram, right?

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:18.430
Looking at the whole history,
if you exclude those early

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:22.600
fluctuations in oil that you see
in the 1870s, which were

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:25.550
not really so important, because
people were really so

00:59:25.550 --> 00:59:28.880
dependent on oil.

00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:41.580
So, the first oil crisis
was 1973 to '74.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:46.650
And this prompted the creation
of the futures market.

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:49.570
Because what happened was --

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:54.040
it was actually coincided with
the Yom Kippur War in Israel.

00:59:54.040 --> 01:00:05.000
And it was created by a blockade
against oil in

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.050
oil-producing countries.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:08.330
The U.S. was no longer,
by this time, the

01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:10.480
major producer of oil.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.220
We had something called OPEC,
which is the Organization of

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:18.855
Petroleum Exporting Countries.

01:00:18.855 --> 01:00:26.880
It actually goes back
to 1961 with Qatar.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:36.650
1962, Libya, Indonesia.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:41.440
And then, we added the Abu Dhabi
in '67, the United Arab

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.490
Emirates, '74, Algeria in 1969,
Nigeria in 1971, Ecuador

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.550
in 1973, Gabon in 1975.

01:00:52.550 --> 01:00:55.440
So what happened was, although
the U.S. broke the Standard

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:02.050
Oil monopoly around the turn of
the century, a new monopoly

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:04.800
developed, and it was outside
the U.S. And so, there was no

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:11.010
trustbusters to break
this monopoly.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:15.660
And so, what happened was, the
oil exporting countries who

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:23.270
belonged to OPEC, who wanted
to use oil prices as a

01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:28.490
strategy to deal with Israel,
they restricted

01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:29.700
their supply of oil.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:34.660
And it caused the first
oil crisis right here.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:40.050
I was going to mention another
historical fact that, I think,

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:44.500
precedes this, but it's
part of the story.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:53.535
And that is nationalizations
of oil.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:03.910
It used to be that big oil
companies went around the

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:06.750
world and found oil deposits.

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:08.660
And then, they would buy the
land, and they wouldn't tell

01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:10.290
anybody what they were doing.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:14.380
They'd buy the land that
had the oil under it.

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.800
So, the oil companies
were very rich.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.990
But there was discontent in the
less developed countries,

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:23.060
who sold them the land and
thought, why did we

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.070
get gypped like that?

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:28.740
And so, they started
a process.

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:35.170
It started with Mexico
in 1938.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:40.560
So, oil used to be owned
by the oil companies.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.430
Mexico said, no,
not any longer.

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.480
It's our national heritage.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.600
We never should have
sold it to you.

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.410
We're just taking it back.

01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:52.120
This was considered outrageous
at the time.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:55.220
No country should violate
property rights like that.

01:02:55.220 --> 01:02:58.605
But it was kind of
a leftist --

01:02:58.605 --> 01:03:01.480
the word nationalization
was a new word.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.560
It was kind of like the people
expressing their heritage.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:08.110
It started to take.

01:03:08.110 --> 01:03:14.670
Then, Iran in 1951.

01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:16.740
And then, other countries
followed.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:20.200
So, oil got taken away from
international companies and

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.100
put under government control of
less developed countries.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.380
And then, there was a monopoly
called OPEC, and that produced

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.040
this crisis right here.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:36.260
There was a second oil
crisis in 1979-80.

01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:40.760
And this one, again, was
associated with trouble in the

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:49.770
Middle East. So, in '79-80, we
had the Iranian revolution,

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:52.740
which again disrupted
oil supply.

01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.830
So, 1979-80 is the second
oil crisis.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.210
And that is due to the fall of
the Shah of Iran, and the

01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:08.080
arrival of the Ayatollah
Khomeini, and

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:11.080
the Iran-Iraq War.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.710
And so, you can see the huge
increase in oil prices.

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:17.500
These were real panic situations
at the time,

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.360
because people were not
used to these --

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.310
people were used to the stable
oil prices, and it was just

01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:25.200
something taken for granted.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.397
But this put the world in a
state of shock, because oil

01:04:28.397 --> 01:04:35.240
prices really jumped up almost
sixfold, about sixfold, in a

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.490
matter of --

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.110
how many years is that? --

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.360
six, seven years.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:50.200
So, this left a lot of interest
and enthusiasm for

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.090
oil futures, and it became a
major market of the kind we

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.460
know about today.

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.826
You know, what happened here?

01:04:55.826 --> 01:04:57.050
This mark.

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:58.170
This is another --

01:04:58.170 --> 01:05:04.100
This is the second Iraq War,
when Saddam Hussein was

01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:06.705
overthrown.

01:05:06.705 --> 01:05:08.510
And the U.S. and
other countries

01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:10.170
were involved in that.

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:13.880
But what it did is, it cut off
the supply of oil briefly,

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.560
because the Persian Gulf was
shut down because of a war.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:20.240
You can bet that the futures
market was heavily

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.480
backwardated right
then, for oil.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:26.680
Because everyone knew that the
oil prices were not --

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:30.850
we weren't running out of oil,
we couldn't get at it because

01:05:30.850 --> 01:05:32.430
of the war.

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:36.500
And so, this was another
oil-induced spike.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:39.830
Every one of these spikes
produced a major worldwide

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:42.760
recession, because the world
wasn't ready for

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:43.600
these spikes enough.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:47.720
So, we see this huge spike
in oil in '73,

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.490
and a worldwide recession.

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:51.880
Again, another worldwide
recession.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:54.970
This one was called The Great
Recession, people forgot that

01:05:54.970 --> 01:05:56.580
they called it that,
and they use that

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.070
term again more recently.

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:00.700
And then there was another
worldwide recession --

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:03.020
every one of these did it.

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.500
And so, you can see the
fundamental importance of oil,

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.910
and of oil futures, because
oil futures is

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.560
managing the risk.

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:15.200
If you bought an oil futures
contract, you

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:17.050
weren't impacted by this.

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:22.290
If you bought a contract just
before this, then the oil

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:23.620
crisis doesn't mean
anything to me.

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:26.170
It's not my problem, because
I've already

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.670
locked in my price.

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.540
And it's really safe, because
the way the futures markets

01:06:30.540 --> 01:06:34.000
work, they've got this daily
settlement process.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.340
So, you don't have to
worry about your

01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:37.070
counterparty reneging.

01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:39.150
It's very civilized.

01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:41.710
It's a tough world out there,
where they're fighting wars,

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.360
but in Chicago, where the
futures markets are --

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.690
or it was in New York
back then --

01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:49.790
it's a very civilized market.

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:52.210
And so, look here, we have
the latest spike.

01:06:55.980 --> 01:06:57.350
It's even bigger.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:06:58.660
So, oil got to --

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:00.670
I can't even reach up there --

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:05.490
oil got up to over $140
a barrel in 2008.

01:07:05.490 --> 01:07:06.815
That's just a short time ago.

01:07:06.815 --> 01:07:08.065
Now, what did that?

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:14.040
That is kind of a puzzle.

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.830
It has something to do with the
world financial crisis.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.640
But it's not as well understood
as a reaction to

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:26.220
any military situation.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.990
So, it seems like there's
some speculative

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.230
element that took place.

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:35.040
See ultimately, oil is stored in
the ground, and it's owned

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.690
by people, and they have to
decide how to develop it and

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.590
how fast to produce
it and sell it.

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:45.210
And there were some quick
changes of thinking around

01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:49.290
then, that surprised
everyone, I think.

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:53.390
And oil is, again, up above
$100 a barrel right now.

01:07:53.390 --> 01:07:55.860
Just we saw in the
futures curve.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:08:00.899
So, actually the futures curve
that we saw would look kind of

01:08:00.899 --> 01:08:03.200
unimpressive on this
diagram, right?

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:07.670
It would be just going up a
little more and a little down,

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:09.755
not big swings that
are predicted.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:22.370
I just want to finally conclude
with financial

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:26.080
futures, which I didn't
emphasize in this lecture.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:31.130
But we also have futures
markets in financial

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:32.580
commodities, and I'm just
going to tell you

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.040
about one of them.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:43.530
It's called the S&amp;P 500 futures
market, index futures.

01:08:43.530 --> 01:08:51.370
And now, in effect, you have to
deliver not oil, or rice,

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:56.600
or wheat, but you have to
deliver the S&amp;P 500 index.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.229
How do you do that,
by the way?

01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:00.830
How do I deliver 500 stocks?

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:04.880
Well, there's a procedure, and
it's called cash settlement.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:06.300
It's different.

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:09.029
Instead of showing up at
warehouse with your trucks

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:14.290
full of wheat, you only show
up with the money, because

01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:18.420
they don't expect you to
do that with stocks.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.609
What is the storage
cost for stocks?

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:27.383
Well, you know, it's
actually negative.

01:09:27.383 --> 01:09:29.330
It doesn't cost me
anything to buy.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.790
If I buy a share in a company
and store it, it

01:09:32.790 --> 01:09:33.550
doesn't cost --

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:37.149
it's a negative cost, because
they pay a dividend.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:40.370
So, the fair value, and this is
what you'll see quoted all

01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:45.500
the time on CNBC, or any
of these business --

01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:46.250
Bloomberg --

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:49.620
these business networks is --

01:09:52.980 --> 01:10:01.610
So, the futures price is equal
to 1 plus r minus y, times the

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:03.850
spot price.

01:10:03.850 --> 01:10:07.000
Same formula.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.270
This is the interest rate.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:14.110
And this is the dividend
yield.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.310
So now, whether the futures
price is above or below the

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:27.070
spot price, is less clear here,
because it depends on

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:30.100
whether the interest rate
is higher than the

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:31.940
dividend rate or lower.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.600
At this point in history, for
short time horizons, the

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.290
interest rate is less than
the dividend rate.

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:42.080
We have about a 2% dividend
yield on stocks, and we have

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.560
essentially a 0%
interest rate.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.440
So, for short horizons, we'd
expect to see the futures

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.200
price less than the spot price
in stock index futures.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.400
But at longer horizons, I think
that would be reversed.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.740
But this market is very clear.

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:01.500
The fair value relationship is
highly predictive of futures

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:05.460
prices in the S&amp;P 500 index
futures, because there's

01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.250
always storage of stocks.

01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:10.640
We never deplete the warehouses
of stocks, so

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.180
they're always there.

01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.860
And so, that means that the
futures curve is less

01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:18.980
interesting for stocks
than it is for oil.

01:11:18.980 --> 01:11:22.220
All it does is reflect
fair value.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:27.130
And so, it's not like oil, where
the storage situation is

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:31.520
very complicated, and it's
constantly changing.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:38.420
So in a sense, the S&amp;P 500 index
futures is not so much

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.820
about the future.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.070
The futures curve is not so much
about the future of the

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:45.290
stock market.

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:49.160
So, don't make the mistake of
looking at the futures curve

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.420
for the S&amp;P 500, and thinking
I'm going to forecast the

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:54.210
market using this curve.

01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.150
You can't.

01:11:56.150 --> 01:12:00.810
Basically, the S&amp;P 500 is very
hard to forecast. And the

01:12:00.810 --> 01:12:03.960
futures curve doesn't do you
anything, because all it

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.580
reflects is fair value.

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:09.130
So, some futures markets, like
gold futures is like this

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:12.880
also, there's always gold in
storage, it never gets

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:14.190
depleted to zero.

01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:17.440
It's always being stored, so the
gold futures curve is not

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.690
so interesting, either.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:28.590
Next, after the midterm exam,
which you have coming up on

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:32.910
Wednesday, we will come
to options pricing.

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:40.140
And that's another fascinating
market that we'll talk about.

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.320
Prof: Here we are,
talking about--recapitulating

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.882
the work done on--
in reading part of the poem,

00:00:09.882 --> 00:00:12.500
selections of this poem.
 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.945
It's a little difficult;
of course, I'm not going to

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.660
tell you exactly what we have
been talking about.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.822
We have been reading from the
work outside of the Divine

00:00:26.822 --> 00:00:29.168
Comedy;
we started there with the

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:32.164
Vita nuova,
which we read as you recall,

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:36.103
as a visionary text,
as a story of an education,

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:40.685
as an autobiography and we
tried to explore what those

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.180
terms mean and how they interact
with each other.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.360
How does one term shed light on
the other?

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.962
What does it mean to write an
autobiography and at the same

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.640
time having an education?
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.776
The two converge,
of course, in Dante's

00:00:57.776 --> 00:00:59.300
imagination.
 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.698
You can only write an
education--a story of your

00:01:02.698 --> 00:01:07.400
education if you have a sense of
what your whole life is about.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.230
If you have some pattern of
coherence and intelligibility

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.682
that you can impose on,
and extract from,

00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:19.220
respectively,
the sense of your life.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.840
But above all,
I was interested in that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.741
partial,
because it's sort of--it's

00:01:25.741 --> 00:01:29.230
truncated at the end as a sort
of interruption--

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.203
deliberate interruption,
because what kind of

00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:33.959
preparation it gives us.
 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.897
To what extent is it repeated
that adventure Dante narrates in

00:01:38.897 --> 00:01:43.995
the Vita nuova is kind of
an adumbration of the Divine

00:01:43.995 --> 00:01:45.209
Comedy?
 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.703
In many ways the two texts
really are implicating each

00:01:49.703 --> 00:01:55.129
other in the sense that Dante
finishes the Vita nuova--

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.319
stops writing the Vita
nuova,

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.314
that's the inconclusive,
the unfinished quality of the

00:02:01.314 --> 00:02:04.783
text so that he can go on
writing the Divine

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:07.328
Comedy,
if you see what I'm saying.

00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:10.990
The Vita nuova ends with
the statement of a project,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.010
of a project to come,
which therefore will be in a

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.854
certain way the fulfillment of
what is only hinted at in the

00:02:19.854 --> 00:02:21.658
Vita nuova.
 

00:02:21.658 --> 00:02:25.220
The two texts are literally one
is preparing for the other,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.870
the other one--then the
Divine Comedy turns out the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.520
way we were reading the
Divine Comedy last time.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.490
The Divine Comedy itself
has a sort of inconclusive

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.479
quality about it.
 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:44.199
Dante reaches and experiences
the beatific vision,

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:51.800
and yet his text succumbs to
the enormity of the task of

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.792
describing it,
and there were a number of

00:02:55.792 --> 00:02:58.128
reasons why we said Dante does
that.

00:02:58.128 --> 00:03:02.038
What seems to be,
and is, a defeat at the level

00:03:02.038 --> 00:03:07.219
of the imagination turns out to
be a great triumph for Dante's

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:09.258
own theology,
right?

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:13.318
The measure in which that the
poem ends in a kind of defeat,

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:17.631
in sort of the--with the
admission of the impossibility

00:03:17.631 --> 00:03:20.693
for Dante--
the poet's language to contain

00:03:20.693 --> 00:03:25.165
and therefore reify,
circumscribe that which he has

00:03:25.165 --> 00:03:26.460
seen, right?
 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.766
He's sort of ending with this
question mark,

00:03:31.766 --> 00:03:37.940
this vision of effigy as he
says, our own image.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.020
That's all that is left for him
to recall,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:47.598
which really means that--in the
refusal to pinpoint,

00:03:47.598 --> 00:03:50.639
describe, and define the so
called beatific vision,

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.520
some people could be very
disappointed;

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.639
why doesn't he tell us what he
really saw?

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.990
Because that would be the
statement valid for him;

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.296
he wants us,
at the end of the poem to

00:04:01.296 --> 00:04:04.418
adventure,
to take our own journey and

00:04:04.418 --> 00:04:08.913
make our own discoveries about
that which remains the essential

00:04:08.913 --> 00:04:11.669
point of the Divine
Comedy,

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.101
as is the essential point of
all great texts about tradition:

00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:19.720
the encounter between the human
and the Divine.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.540
That is the point of all the
great epics.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.163
Whether it is in the form
the Aeneid where the hero

00:04:27.163 --> 00:04:31.949
is always uncertain about what
the gods are telling him,

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.076
uncertain as how to decipher
it, and yet he nonetheless

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:41.620
pursues what he takes to be--
and makes mistakes--Aeneas,

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.279
along the way--
but what he takes to be God's

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.839
will.
 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.470
This is the way he can live out
his own sense of ethical

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.084
imperative to himself,
to his people,

00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:56.221
the refugees that are coming
from Asia Minor and going toward

00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:59.851
an unknown land,
and the Divine imperative,

00:04:59.851 --> 00:05:05.223
or whether it's going to be the
renaissance text from Spencer's

00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:10.524
Fairy Queen to Tasso's,
to Milton, to Lucretius,

00:05:10.524 --> 00:05:13.860
who writes in a theological
epic.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.370
The idea he wants to cure his
readers,

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.819
he has one reader in mind:
the young epicurean,

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:24.319
and this is Lucretius,
whom Dante had never read--

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.410
he read in parts and was very
fascinated by what he read,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.579
who wants to educate one young
man,

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:35.434
Manaus, a young epicurean to
the real and bitter truth of

00:05:35.434 --> 00:05:40.810
what the epicurean philosophy
may be and that bitter truth,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.406
the harsh truth--Lucretius
thinks that there is no such

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:44.940
thing.
 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.190
That ours--the Roman world is a
desecrated world,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.500
that the gods have fled,
that's the--

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.000
but that is still in the mode
of an atheist,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.213
it is still a theological
concern because the implication

00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:03.425
of what I'm saying is that
atheism itself may be a way of

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:05.601
addressing,
of course, it's a way of

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:08.559
addressing the question of God,
the un-knowability of God,

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.180
the distance of God,
maybe the non-existence of the

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.629
gods.
 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.064
The Divine Comedy from
this point of view partakes of

00:06:16.064 --> 00:06:17.870
this extraordinary tradition.
 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.379
But he does it in a way which
is remarkably different;

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:25.358
Dante does his theology in a
way which is remarkably

00:06:25.358 --> 00:06:28.863
different from anything else
that has gone on before him and,

00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:30.500
in many ways,
after him.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.620
I think there is a mode of
recapitulation,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.937
this is what I have to--I will
have to briefly illustrate and

00:06:36.937 --> 00:06:40.422
give you the chance to ask more
questions specifically about the

00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:40.920
poem.
 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.848
Some of these things that I
have said to you--the whole poem

00:06:44.848 --> 00:06:47.379
moves towards this kind of
theology.

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.497
Condensed in Canto XXXIII of
Paradise,

00:06:51.497 --> 00:06:54.120
recapitulated right there.
 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.994
Of course Inferno goes
on talking about issues of

00:06:57.994 --> 00:07:00.244
politics,
which is not that they are

00:07:00.244 --> 00:07:03.574
easy, they are very complicated,
but in some ways they are

00:07:03.574 --> 00:07:05.490
rooted in Dante's own theology.
 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.281
That is, it's too easy to
believe that,

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:09.500
you know, this is politics,
this is theology;

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.009
they are always implicated with
one another.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.004
In fact, sometimes the best way
to understand the theology is to

00:07:15.004 --> 00:07:17.829
talk about the politics,
and the best way to understand

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:20.449
the politics is to really talk
about the theology.

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:25.360
They are completely,
always implicating each other.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.581
Inferno talks about the
ethics and the politics,

00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:32.399
Purgatorio talks about
aesthetics and ethics above all.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:38.490
The possibility of
reconstructing the human beings;

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.827
so flawed they seem to be,
so incredibly sunk into the

00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:47.329
ditches of their own
perversions, of our perversions.

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:51.336
How do you--so radical,
Dante's condemnation of the

00:07:51.336 --> 00:07:53.983
political realities,
of civil war,

00:07:53.983 --> 00:07:56.089
people cannibalizing each
other,

00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:58.290
and not in a metaphor that man
is a wolf to man,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.509
but literally they are doing
this.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.120
How do you get out of it?
 

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.954
It's very difficult to be
so--to ostracize politics from

00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:09.790
the possibility of the human
imagination and then at one

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:12.649
point saying,
well I still need this.

00:08:12.649 --> 00:08:15.333
How are you going to make a
persuasive case for your

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:15.860
readers?
 

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.769
This was the great challenge of
Purgatorio.

00:08:21.769 --> 00:08:27.839
We saw the question of time,
the great problem of freedom,

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:31.499
that all of a sudden seemed to
surface in Purgatorio

00:08:31.499 --> 00:08:33.760
with Cato's suicide,
you remember,

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:38.075
with the debate about the soul,
and created freedom,

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:44.193
and by an act of freedom,
God's freedom to the attainment

00:08:44.193 --> 00:08:45.980
of the free will.
 

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.450
Around this extraordinary
concern of freedom,

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.899
and therefore the possibilities
of the moral life,

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:58.928
we came to the conclusion of
Purgatorio with a garden,

00:08:58.928 --> 00:09:02.399
the Garden of Eden,
the place of pleasures,

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:06.629
the place where pleasures are
not damned in and of themselves.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.710
The question becomes now,
because that is the Sabbath,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.128
that is the moment where
you--pleasure can be seen as the

00:09:14.128 --> 00:09:18.941
crown of work that which crowns,
the correlation of one's own

00:09:18.941 --> 00:09:20.259
labors and so on.
 

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:23.320
That is also rooted in theology.
 

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.595
Then we ended up in
Paradise where we really

00:09:26.595 --> 00:09:28.700
talked directly,
because I think that's really

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:29.740
the substance of
Paradise,

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.418
the possibility of thinking of
an aesthetic theology.

00:09:33.418 --> 00:09:36.070
How art and theology go hand in
hand,

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.840
because what joins them is the
question of--

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:43.168
not just the question of the
art being the temptation,

00:09:43.168 --> 00:09:46.399
ethical temptation,
but now the question of beauty

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:49.168
as the mode of revelation of the
Divine.

00:09:49.168 --> 00:09:52.220
Therefore, the implication was,
and let's hope--

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.929
I have said that very clearly,
that art becomes a way to know

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:59.080
God,
a way to know the Divine,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.601
so we are moving away from
traditional assumptions about

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:05.418
what is the path to go and
encounter God.

00:10:05.418 --> 00:10:08.370
What is really the discovery of
the Sacred;

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.120
is the Sacred going to be
found, some texts in Dante seems

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.740
to have believed that at some
point in a particular--

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.783
in the animation of nature,
is it going to be found in the

00:10:18.783 --> 00:10:20.918
love that you have for your
Beatrice,

00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:24.639
or you, or Beatrice's for your
Dante, or whatever.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:29.558
He goes on thinking about these
concerns and how everything that

00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:34.009
belongs to the world of art is
the part of the path to the

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.870
Divine.
 

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:38.011
Theology and aesthetics not
just as--well,

00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:41.921
aesthetics as a way of making
beautiful the reality,

00:10:41.921 --> 00:10:45.370
the theological content of
Dante's faith.

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.736
Not just that,
but--that's no longer the

00:10:47.736 --> 00:10:49.620
question of an ornamentation.
 

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.643
That was the problem,
by the way, of Lucretius who at

00:10:52.643 --> 00:10:55.672
one point says,
I wanted to write poetry

00:10:55.672 --> 00:11:00.214
because I want to make pleasant
the bitter medicine that

00:11:00.214 --> 00:11:03.600
Epicurus goes on administering
to you.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.139
The way he says it,
that the gods have fled,

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:09.506
that there is no such a thing
as sacredness in the cosmos,

00:11:09.506 --> 00:11:11.278
that's too bitter to bear.
 

00:11:11.278 --> 00:11:15.015
I'm going to say it nicely,
now that's really--not so for

00:11:15.015 --> 00:11:15.548
Dante.
 

00:11:15.548 --> 00:11:21.038
How the actual exercise of art,
it's an ascetic exercise.

00:11:21.038 --> 00:11:24.340
You move through art,
you refine, you think,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.950
and you question all the
things.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.923
It's not just an
ornamentation--ornamentation of

00:11:29.923 --> 00:11:33.654
being the word for cosmetics,
for beautifying that which one

00:11:33.654 --> 00:11:35.678
has--that which he will say.
 

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:38.330
These were the concerns and we
came to Canto XXXIII of

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:41.131
Paradise,
and I maintain to you and as

00:11:41.131 --> 00:11:44.846
way of recapitulation,
I think I have said to you,

00:11:44.846 --> 00:11:48.000
I hope that I have said it all
to you,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.544
but I will gladly go over it
and I hope that if you see more

00:11:54.544 --> 00:11:57.607
or not quite,
haven't seen what I think I've

00:11:57.607 --> 00:12:00.638
been saying,
say it, that's really your last

00:12:00.638 --> 00:12:04.399
chance as far as I go in this
public mode here.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:08.541
The first thing that we
understand about Dante's

00:12:08.541 --> 00:12:13.740
theology is the extraordinary
rootedness of this theology in

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.678
the human reality.
 

00:12:15.678 --> 00:12:20.645
Canto XXXIII is the canto of
prayer, and we'll talk more

00:12:20.645 --> 00:12:24.710
about the prayer as a mode of
theologizing.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.850
Why is it a special mode of
theologizing?

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:29.070
The first thing is that it is a
prayer to the Virgin Mary,

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.506
that is to say a way of
thinking about how the Divine

00:12:33.506 --> 00:12:38.200
has entered the world of history
and the human flesh.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.360
There's no such thing as an
extraordinary--

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.613
and I think--even talking about
the cosmology of Dante I tried

00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.190
to hint,
tried to say--look the physical

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.870
world and the metaphysical world
are all part of one universe.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.788
They are two separate
hemispheres and yet there is

00:12:54.788 --> 00:12:57.394
always a cross,
there is a chiasmus that will

00:12:57.394 --> 00:12:59.917
connect them,
but will make them because

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.308
that's the irony of every
chiasmus.

00:13:02.308 --> 00:13:03.700
You know what I mean by
chiasmus?

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.808
It comes from the Greek letter
chi in Greek,

00:13:06.808 --> 00:13:09.373
that's a chiasmus,
an X, and wherever a chiasmus

00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:12.210
you have a point of intersection
of the two arms,

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:14.548
but that becomes also a point
of flight.

00:13:14.548 --> 00:13:17.466
Things come together and can be
seen to come together,

00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:20.658
but things also seem to be
divergent, seem to be going away

00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:22.090
from each other,
okay.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.904
This is the cosmos of Dante;
it's an extension of what he

00:13:26.904 --> 00:13:29.070
will say in the prayer to the
Virgin.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.379
The human rootedness of the
Divine, not dualities,

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:38.389
okay, that's really a primary
item.

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:41.090
This will conclude,
with the idea that with the--

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:45.706
and makes it persuasive that
what Dante sees and remembers at

00:13:45.706 --> 00:13:49.202
the end is our effigy,
which is clearly a throwback to

00:13:49.202 --> 00:13:49.658
Genesis.
 

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:54.158
Let us make man in our image
and likeness,

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:57.376
that's what Dante will see,
but this also means that we are

00:13:57.376 --> 00:14:00.376
in the world of images,
that Dante's own journey ends

00:14:00.376 --> 00:14:03.888
in the world of images,
but not in images as deceptive

00:14:03.888 --> 00:14:06.688
appearances,
only--that which we saw the

00:14:06.688 --> 00:14:09.340
whole of Purgatorio is
full of,

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.649
now somehow the image probably
because of our,

00:14:12.649 --> 00:14:16.917
the shared quality of that
image becomes the locus

00:14:16.917 --> 00:14:18.668
of the Sacred itself.
 

00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:22.835
It becomes, not something that
just hides, but also reveals the

00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:23.440
Divine.
 

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.732
The second thing that I think
that we have learned to

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:30.090
understand about this theology
of Dante is freedom.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.298
That the foundation of Dante's
own--the foundation of his

00:14:34.298 --> 00:14:38.057
beliefs, the foundation of his
theological beliefs,

00:14:38.057 --> 00:14:39.408
is in freedom.
 

00:14:39.408 --> 00:14:41.759
We talked about the theological
virtues,

00:14:41.759 --> 00:14:44.912
as you recall,
the theological virtues faith,

00:14:44.912 --> 00:14:48.206
hope, and charity:
XXIV, XXV, and XXVI with the

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:51.360
various examinations that Dante
goes on.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.774
If you recall,
we were talking about the fact

00:14:55.774 --> 00:15:00.788
that Dante thinks of faith as an
act of freedom.

00:15:00.788 --> 00:15:05.201
That's not unusual for those
who have any theological

00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:10.292
interest to even find traces and
implications of this kind of

00:15:10.292 --> 00:15:11.480
statement.
 

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.240
Faith is, for Dante,
a way of knowing;

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.999
he connects it with knowledge,
which is not just a way of

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:22.759
saying that faith intervenes
when knowledge stops because

00:15:22.759 --> 00:15:26.720
someone who is interested in his
curiosity of knowing--

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.169
now I don't know I'll try hard,
maybe tomorrow I will know,

00:15:29.169 --> 00:15:31.710
I don't need any faith, right?
 

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:34.298
If you really think about the
relationship between knowledge

00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:36.471
and faith,
you can't say faith emerges at

00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:39.621
the boundary line of knowledge
because that boundary line is

00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:42.980
always shifting,
and that would imply the

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:47.370
progressive reduction of a kind
of receding,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:54.250
and diminishing fragment of the
dimension of faith.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:57.831
Dante's saying by connecting a
university examination and the

00:15:57.831 --> 00:16:01.293
problem of faith is that faith
itself is a way of knowing I

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.994
have faith,
and that means that I see the

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:06.158
world in an entirely different
way;

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:09.570
I can see myself disengaged
from everything around me.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.230
I can see that nothing really
matters;

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:16.336
that all the patterns and
parameters of reasons are going

00:16:16.336 --> 00:16:17.950
to be found wanting.
 

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.370
That's really--so it's tied
with freedom.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:25.668
Hope introduces the question of
the future, and you cannot have

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:27.678
freedom without the future.
 

00:16:27.678 --> 00:16:30.690
We talked about these temporal
issues.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:33.634
You can only think about the
possibility of a future if you

00:16:33.634 --> 00:16:36.626
believe that it is a novelty,
if there is a freedom--if you

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:38.889
are in bondage you cannot really
think of that.

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:42.303
Theologically,
because I don't want to confuse

00:16:42.303 --> 00:16:46.857
you at all, you remember that
all three cantos were literally

00:16:46.857 --> 00:16:49.590
woven with references to Exodus.
 

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:54.398
All three cantos and the story
of Exodus, which is crucial to

00:16:54.398 --> 00:16:58.645
Dante's poetic figuration,
is the story of the freedom

00:16:58.645 --> 00:17:00.889
from a state of bondage.
 

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:04.990
This is the way we understand
him, but Dante also knows that

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:09.440
freedom can--you only have to
shift--this is Luther of course;

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.088
freedom and faith are one in
the same thing.

00:17:12.088 --> 00:17:13.910
In his attack--you remember
that?

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.675
I mentioned this to you,
it doesn't concern Dante but

00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:19.548
concerns the issue and so we'll
mention for clarity.

00:17:19.548 --> 00:17:21.242
They debated,
the two of them,

00:17:21.242 --> 00:17:24.686
Luther and Erasmus over the
idea of what freedom of the will

00:17:24.686 --> 00:17:26.818
means,
and they are really debating a

00:17:26.818 --> 00:17:29.798
text written a century earlier
by one humanist by the name of

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:32.480
Valla and they disagree about
what that text means.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.801
Luther says to Erasmus,
you really are interested in

00:17:38.801 --> 00:17:42.150
faith as a form of order.
 

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:46.147
I'm interested in faith as a
form of freedom because that

00:17:46.147 --> 00:17:48.288
frees me from all loyalties.
 

00:17:48.288 --> 00:17:52.230
It's madness by the sublime
quality of the statement,

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:55.929
but you only have to shift the
ground a little bit and realize

00:17:55.929 --> 00:17:58.441
that freedom,
can really become,

00:17:58.441 --> 00:18:01.009
and is the source of atheism.
 

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:05.468
Atheism, all of a sudden,
becomes important because human

00:18:05.468 --> 00:18:09.210
beings don't want to be
subjected to anybody.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:12.258
It's part of the project to say
I am my own man,

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:15.175
I am my own woman,
I want to do exactly what I

00:18:15.175 --> 00:18:15.759
want.
 

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:20.111
I don't want to have any
loyalties or accept anything

00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:22.118
that I don't even see.
 

00:18:22.118 --> 00:18:27.230
We can bear with the master
that we see and maybe has a

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.523
knife at us,
but someone as distant and

00:18:30.523 --> 00:18:33.893
remote we--
Dante then says that's the

00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:38.420
peculiarity of this religious
belief of mine,

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.086
which is really all about
freedom, including the freedom

00:18:43.086 --> 00:18:45.038
to deny the divinity.
 

00:18:45.038 --> 00:18:47.772
This is extraordinary,
never heard of in the history

00:18:47.772 --> 00:18:51.150
of--as far as I know and I have
a very limited knowledge believe

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.178
me, it's no rhetoric;
very limited knowledge but I

00:18:54.178 --> 00:18:56.348
have never seen anything like
this.

00:18:56.348 --> 00:19:00.563
The third element about this
theology is really the great

00:19:00.563 --> 00:19:03.798
element of love,
to discover that the way to

00:19:03.798 --> 00:19:07.371
God, yes it's hard;
there are many ways first of

00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:08.160
all to God.
 

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.511
There is the philosophical of
going through knowing,

00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:14.666
there is the linguistic way
through the language,

00:19:14.666 --> 00:19:17.558
and I'll come to this issue in
a moment.

00:19:17.558 --> 00:19:20.419
There is poetry,
there is the world of beauty,

00:19:20.419 --> 00:19:24.105
then there's the language of
the heart, but primarily it is

00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:26.328
the path to the Divine is love.
 

00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:30.423
Dante understands,
I wasn't saying that love is so

00:19:30.423 --> 00:19:35.186
mysterious because I know that
deep down you are all young

00:19:35.186 --> 00:19:37.346
people,
many of you are,

00:19:37.346 --> 00:19:41.108
a couple here are younger,
much younger than I am but not

00:19:41.108 --> 00:19:43.699
really that young,
so they are not surprised by

00:19:43.699 --> 00:19:44.210
any this.
 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.108
But I know that deep down,
I remember being young,

00:19:47.108 --> 00:19:49.170
how I think about the mystery
of love,

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.980
ah… that really speaks
to everybody's heart.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.480
I wasn't meaning it that way.
 

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.674
It is really a thought point
that the principle of election,

00:19:57.674 --> 00:20:01.443
which is so crucial to love,
it really cannot be quite

00:20:01.443 --> 00:20:02.440
explained.
 

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.108
I really was meaning it in this
theological way as possible.

00:20:06.108 --> 00:20:09.703
I was already thinking about
the statements that I was going

00:20:09.703 --> 00:20:12.078
to make today about Dante's
theology.

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:15.230
These are some of the issues
that Dante has.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:18.905
The other day,
yesterday, the day before I was

00:20:18.905 --> 00:20:23.890
asked the question about one
line in Dante and I was very--

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.919
it was a very good question
about the fact that Dante's

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:30.141
allowed to see the truth,
that the light he saw was the

00:20:30.141 --> 00:20:30.539
truth.
 

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:31.950
That was a very good question.
 

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.640
What does it mean?
 

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.256
To me it was so clear,
and I apologize,

00:20:36.256 --> 00:20:40.317
because I said well this is
really the biblical idea in your

00:20:40.317 --> 00:20:43.210
light, which your notes will
tell you.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.551
In your light I see the light,
we see the light,

00:20:46.551 --> 00:20:48.259
and what does it mean?
 

00:20:48.259 --> 00:20:49.910
In your light we see the light.
 

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:54.838
What it is that it's part of
this mystery that if you are a

00:20:54.838 --> 00:20:59.855
mystic and you think that the
Divine is wrapped in a kind of

00:20:59.855 --> 00:21:03.778
transcendent darkness,
that's the language,

00:21:03.778 --> 00:21:08.420
or that it is really all
wrapped in impenetrable light,

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.887
it's both the same because
neither light has the

00:21:11.887 --> 00:21:16.390
peculiarity never letting you
see the origin of the light,

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.674
and darkness has the
peculiarity of never letting you

00:21:19.674 --> 00:21:21.759
see the origin of the darkness.
 

00:21:21.759 --> 00:21:24.238
When Dante reaches
Paradiso XXXIII,

00:21:24.238 --> 00:21:27.319
and that's the meaning your
light, we see the light,

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:29.920
Dante sees finally the origin
of light.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.930
That's the point.
 

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.074
There are moments where his
sight can become so incredibly

00:21:36.074 --> 00:21:40.000
sharp and so penetrating,
so look at all these ways.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.344
The ways--there are many ways
in which we can take available

00:21:43.344 --> 00:21:46.404
to us and it seems that we are
always stumbling against

00:21:46.404 --> 00:21:49.410
something that in the long run
you have to stop,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.682
and yet if you love,
if you think that beauty is

00:21:54.682 --> 00:21:57.145
part--
which is part of love,

00:21:57.145 --> 00:22:00.955
beauty is part of--
love is the hunger for beauty

00:22:00.955 --> 00:22:03.259
the neo-Platonist will say.
 

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:07.162
In the Florentine neo-Platonist
Lorenzo--I don't know where he

00:22:07.162 --> 00:22:12.028
found it probably in Plotinus;
love is the hunger for beauty.

00:22:12.028 --> 00:22:15.659
All of these are ways that
Dante keeps opening for us in

00:22:15.659 --> 00:22:19.221
our journey to the Divine,
and then there is the prayer

00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:21.730
which is the question of
language.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.261
That has also become one of the
ways in which I indicate that

00:22:27.261 --> 00:22:32.608
there is a theological root to
the question of language.

00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:37.682
Not only that we speak out of
speaking and language is an

00:22:37.682 --> 00:22:41.627
allegory,
a parable of our desires,

00:22:41.627 --> 00:22:46.818
a parable of what we lack,
we speak because we don't have.

00:22:46.818 --> 00:22:51.273
That's the specific--and we
speak because we--the seat mate

00:22:51.273 --> 00:22:55.498
and we are pointing maybe
without really knowing to what

00:22:55.498 --> 00:22:56.420
we need.
 

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:57.960
It's always a question of need.
 

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.579
Dante has always had a way of
connecting language and desire,

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:04.295
we talked about that,
that's one the themes we

00:23:04.295 --> 00:23:05.140
discussed.
 

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.165
Then all of a sudden in
Paradiso XXXIII,

00:23:08.165 --> 00:23:11.720
though I said to you,
look the language now changes.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:16.171
First of all,
the prayer to the Virgin is all

00:23:16.171 --> 00:23:20.520
about longing,
this state of longing but not

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.140
languishing.
 

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.202
There is an etymological
connection there somewhere which

00:23:25.202 --> 00:23:27.432
is not--
I'm not going to get into but

00:23:27.432 --> 00:23:30.912
there's a longing for the Divine
to show itself to Bernard of

00:23:30.912 --> 00:23:32.710
Clairvaux, the great mystic.
 

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:37.130
He who is the great fierce
opponent of Abelard,

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.190
appears on the scene and
therefore they--

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.240
you can overhear the polemics
which we haven't got time for,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.631
the polemics between Abelard
and Bernard that are clearly

00:23:45.631 --> 00:23:48.660
behind his apparition in
Paradiso XXXIII.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:52.490
They all are waiting for the
Divine to show itself forth,

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:57.242
right, and this language--and
yet this desire all of a sudden

00:23:57.242 --> 00:24:00.730
becomes the language of joy,
of enjoyment.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.059
That's such an extraordinary
shift.

00:24:04.059 --> 00:24:05.480
Why?
 

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.088
Because Dante understands the
problem with desire;

00:24:10.088 --> 00:24:15.318
of course, we like to--we're
always talking about how much--

00:24:15.318 --> 00:24:19.119
how permanent we like to be,
in a state of permanent desires

00:24:19.119 --> 00:24:21.890
because that's what makes us
feel alive,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.480
young, to desire,
you want something.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:32.618
It's true, it's part of the
great power of desire,

00:24:32.618 --> 00:24:37.281
and the language of desire,
but if desire were without an

00:24:37.281 --> 00:24:42.277
object ever then desire becomes
of the greatest absurdity and

00:24:42.277 --> 00:24:43.358
futility.
 

00:24:43.358 --> 00:24:47.383
If we go around thinking that
we are in a labyrinth of desires

00:24:47.383 --> 00:24:51.210
then really that is--it's a
joke, desire becomes a joke.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.276
Dante places this idea of
enjoyment, the possibility of

00:24:55.276 --> 00:24:58.589
this sweetness that instills in
his heart.

00:24:58.589 --> 00:24:59.910
These are the issues.
 

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.209
Then finally,
this idea of prayer,

00:25:02.209 --> 00:25:04.088
and I want to stop there.
 

00:25:04.088 --> 00:25:08.150
Let me stop with the question
of prayer and then get your

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:09.019
questions.
 

00:25:09.019 --> 00:25:13.183
The whole poem,
I think, from the perspective

00:25:13.183 --> 00:25:17.943
of Paradiso XXXIII,
taking retrospectively the

00:25:17.943 --> 00:25:22.205
view, not only the fact that
there are references to the

00:25:22.205 --> 00:25:26.700
first words Dante uses in
Inferno I is a prayer.

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:28.526
"Miserere di
me,"

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:31.680
"Have mercy on me,"
he doesn't even know whether

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.271
you are a shade or a man,
he sees something,

00:25:34.271 --> 00:25:36.749
a shape indistinct,
turns out to be Virgil,

00:25:36.749 --> 00:25:38.200
turns out to be poetry.
 

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:42.355
This is the poetry that lends
itself, offers itself completely

00:25:42.355 --> 00:25:42.970
freely.
 

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.548
You can go to the library and
pick up a book,

00:25:45.548 --> 00:25:47.541
a free act of someone's
generosity.

00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:48.480
There it is.
 

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.818
He turns to it and begins with
a prayer,

00:25:50.818 --> 00:25:54.410
and the poem ends with a
prayer, and ends with--

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.460
it begins with a prayer--the
whole poem,

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.950
the real quality and nature of
language is to be a prayer.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:05.876
A prayer implying the tension
that we have all the time told

00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:08.965
what, for Dante,
told what necessarily

00:26:08.965 --> 00:26:10.470
transcends us.
 

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:17.157
There's always a reality that
is touched directly by the hand

00:26:17.157 --> 00:26:22.509
of God, but escapes the world of
the human plans,

00:26:22.509 --> 00:26:25.519
and the human projects.
 

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:30.208
This is what I think the whole
poem is about,

00:26:30.208 --> 00:26:35.429
and it's above all a poem
addressed to the future,

00:26:35.429 --> 00:26:37.558
addressed to us.
 

00:26:37.558 --> 00:26:39.980
That is to say,
it's not a poem about the past,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.710
Dante is the least nostalgic of
poets,

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.224
it's so easy,
if you really go wherever and

00:26:45.224 --> 00:26:47.920
you tell your grandchildren you
read Dante.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.154
I thought that Dante is a nice
little story about the Middle

00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:51.981
Ages;
we are all nostalgic about the

00:26:51.981 --> 00:26:52.660
Middle Ages.
 

00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:54.875
Maybe some of you are here--how
were these guys,

00:26:54.875 --> 00:26:55.960
how were they living?
 

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.950
In a world of absolute
certainties, right?

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:05.538
Dante is the poet of openness,
the poet who understands

00:27:05.538 --> 00:27:09.808
reason, and understands the
risk.

00:27:09.808 --> 00:27:12.828
Now, that's really what this
poem is about,

00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:15.509
a poem about the future,
the poem addressed with a

00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:17.480
number of apostrophes to
readers,

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.632
and whenever you read
apostrophe to readers from

00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:22.380
beginning of Inferno to
roughly Paradiso X,

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.690
every so often Dante addresses
us.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:26.898
You remember I said,
at one point he stops,

00:27:26.898 --> 00:27:29.317
he made this point,
what are these addresses to

00:27:29.317 --> 00:27:29.950
readers?
 

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:31.788
We can read it--whenever you
have a kind of--

00:27:31.788 --> 00:27:34.519
up to the eighteenth century
you always read novels,

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:37.440
now my dear reader,
now my gentle reader,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.880
they are coaxing you,
pretending they're coaxing you,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.458
they couldn't care whether you
read it or not I don't think

00:27:42.458 --> 00:27:43.259
ultimately.
 

00:27:43.259 --> 00:27:45.519
Dante doesn't really care
whether we are reading him or

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:45.769
not.
 

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:49.817
Now you're following the little
shape of poetry,

00:27:49.817 --> 00:27:53.178
the few of you,
and I think he means it,

00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:57.400
who are not afraid of how rough
the seas are.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.680
You could shipwreck and all of
that--

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.190
of course you could read those
apostrophes as a way of saying,

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.278
look I need you readers because
if I have readers I'm

00:28:08.278 --> 00:28:11.190
constituting myself into an
author.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:15.670
The measure in which there are
readers, then I am the author,

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:19.777
I am an author because I
have--because the poem has made

00:28:19.777 --> 00:28:21.420
me into an author.
 

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:26.145
Of course there is that,
but what I think this is about

00:28:26.145 --> 00:28:31.486
is you are going to use my poem
as the boat with which you can

00:28:31.486 --> 00:28:33.848
start your own journey.
 

00:28:33.848 --> 00:28:35.900
That's the understanding of the
future.

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.470
The poet, Dante,
is a poet of the future,

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:42.568
which is a way of saying there
is a little bit of irony as I

00:28:42.568 --> 00:28:45.355
say this,
that Dante's not a poet of the

00:28:45.355 --> 00:28:48.267
past,
he is the poet toward which we

00:28:48.267 --> 00:28:49.150
are going.
 

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.519
The Middle Ages may not be a
time of the past,

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:55.851
it may be the Middle ages in a
different form or certainly will

00:28:55.851 --> 00:28:58.348
come back,
will probably come back in the

00:28:58.348 --> 00:28:58.828
future.
 

00:28:58.828 --> 00:29:01.190
This is what Dante clearly
thinks.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.930
So let's go now with your
questions.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:09.507
I hope you have many and--not
many, a few so that we can talk

00:29:09.507 --> 00:29:11.588
a bit about this.
 

00:29:11.588 --> 00:29:15.808
Yes, whoever wants to--you came
in late so I must say--

00:29:15.808 --> 00:29:19.372
must repeat this--you have to
sign and there is that beautiful

00:29:19.372 --> 00:29:21.926
young woman right there,
Maria Derlipanska,

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:24.262
that adjective,
you forgive me but it's true

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:28.685
but also--
the other thing is you have to

00:29:28.685 --> 00:29:33.269
talk very closely to the
microphone.

00:29:33.269 --> 00:29:35.366
Student:  Well,
I wanted to talk a little bit

00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:37.915
more about desire and I'm glad
you brought that up because it's

00:29:37.915 --> 00:29:39.890
been on my mind for the last
couple of days.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.912
I was just reading
Shakespeare's 147^(th) sonnet

00:29:43.912 --> 00:29:48.578
yesterday in which he says,
"desire is death,"

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:53.078
and it struck me how different
Dante's inception of desire is

00:29:53.078 --> 00:29:57.654
and it's something that he seems
to want to stay in and relish

00:29:57.654 --> 00:30:00.130
and it's almost life to him.
 

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:05.276
We started this course with the
Vita nuova and I got so

00:30:05.276 --> 00:30:08.230
frustrated reading it because
I--

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.652
part of me was saying if you
love this woman so much why

00:30:10.652 --> 00:30:12.150
don't you do something about it?
 

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:17.023
But it's like Dante no,
he wants to stay in this place

00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:21.371
of longing;
longing is life for him in some

00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:21.880
way.
 

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.748
That seems to me something
vitally important to

00:30:25.748 --> 00:30:31.130
understanding what the Divine
Comedy means and I wonder if

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:36.259
you could just go back and talk
a little bit about the courtly

00:30:36.259 --> 00:30:40.853
love tradition,
how that might have influenced

00:30:40.853 --> 00:30:46.635
Dante's thinking about desire,
and more specifically,

00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:52.608
in a spiritual sense as to
Dante's theology,

00:30:52.608 --> 00:30:56.678
how desire played a role in
Dante's conception of his

00:30:56.678 --> 00:30:58.400
relationship to God?
 

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.119
Prof: Yes, okay.
 

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:04.640
Well good question.
 

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.884
I like the fact that you bring
in, I will take the points as I

00:31:07.884 --> 00:31:10.117
remember them,
but also following at my own

00:31:10.117 --> 00:31:10.970
inner logic.
 

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:14.795
I like the way you bring in
Shakespeare's understanding of

00:31:14.795 --> 00:31:18.788
desire and that desire--
it's not that it's really death

00:31:18.788 --> 00:31:22.174
but ends in death,
that the desire leads you to

00:31:22.174 --> 00:31:22.660
death.
 

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:29.400
That this is a kind of--that is
in many ways also a view largely

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:35.069
shared by Dante in this sense,
but it's not only that,

00:31:35.069 --> 00:31:38.279
Dante does not stop there.
 

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:42.480
In this sense that you have to
understand that there's such a

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.930
thing as a metaphysics of
desire.

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.808
I don't know if the term is new
to you or not.

00:31:48.808 --> 00:31:52.019
What could that phrase possibly
mean?

00:31:52.019 --> 00:31:54.970
Why do we talk--what does it
mean?

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:56.480
Metaphysics of desire,
to some of you,

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.848
it may be a little bit unusual,
it really means this,

00:32:00.848 --> 00:32:04.098
that desire--there is a
dialectics to desire,

00:32:04.098 --> 00:32:08.849
a movement to desire that
necessarily I want this today

00:32:08.849 --> 00:32:12.311
then I want that,
the desire is inexhaustible,

00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:13.650
that's what it means.
 

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.782
From that point of view it's
very important for all those

00:32:17.782 --> 00:32:21.105
like Augustine,
it's part of this restlessness

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.508
of the heart as St.
 

00:32:22.508 --> 00:32:24.278
Augustine mentions.
 

00:32:24.278 --> 00:32:27.009
That's the--a theological
understanding of desire.

00:32:27.009 --> 00:32:30.740
We call it metaphysical because
it really wants the absolutes.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.338
Desire, by definition,
I want now this,

00:32:34.338 --> 00:32:38.308
the smoking of a cigarette for
a great novelist,

00:32:38.308 --> 00:32:41.872
an Italian novelist at the
beginning of the last century

00:32:41.872 --> 00:32:45.984
was the true emblem of desire,
ending in ashes but always like

00:32:45.984 --> 00:32:48.279
a phoenix you can start over
again.

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:53.347
It really means that it
always--it will come to an end

00:32:53.347 --> 00:32:56.598
either in death,
in nothingness;

00:32:56.598 --> 00:33:01.055
finally you renounce all desire
which is the death of desire or

00:33:01.055 --> 00:33:03.568
some idea of the absolute of
God.

00:33:03.568 --> 00:33:08.097
That's really--that's what we
mean by the absolute--this

00:33:08.097 --> 00:33:11.308
absolute tension that desire
entails.

00:33:11.308 --> 00:33:15.150
Now then you asked me to talk
about the Vita nuova and

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:16.750
the uneasiness you had.
 

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:18.507
I mean, you expressed the
uneasiness and I respect your

00:33:18.507 --> 00:33:18.930
uneasiness.
 

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.215
I know a man of action like
you, a student of philosophy as

00:33:23.215 --> 00:33:27.798
you are, then you obviously have
that kind--I think that you're

00:33:27.798 --> 00:33:29.720
supposed to have that.
 

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.934
There is such a thing as a
passivity of the state of

00:33:33.934 --> 00:33:37.845
dejection,
the sense of the mastery of

00:33:37.845 --> 00:33:41.940
love that throws the lover poet
into--

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:44.650
who doesn't really understand
what love is at this point,

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:46.390
that's what part of the
education is.

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.317
He wants to--the story of the
Vita nuova is the story

00:33:49.317 --> 00:33:52.509
of a poet who knows--
he doesn't know Beatrice,

00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:57.103
he calls her Beatrice only
because in the nearness of her

00:33:57.103 --> 00:34:00.778
he would feel beatitudes;
that's what he says,

00:34:00.778 --> 00:34:03.880
so there's a kind of
arbitrariness to names.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.472
We don't care about that now,
we go on with--there is this

00:34:08.472 --> 00:34:12.420
idea that he is--the power of
love dejects him.

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:15.217
It's not yet a virtue,
it's a passion,

00:34:15.217 --> 00:34:18.469
and the word passion really
implies that.

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:22.364
We think that a passion is what
makes us go but Dante makes a

00:34:22.364 --> 00:34:26.130
careful distinction of the will
that becomes paralyzed,

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.980
the desire to be discovered by
the woman he loves.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.070
It's very important for him
that she says "hi"

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.320
when they meet in the streets
and he--

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.753
she won't say "hi"
and so he goes home and he's

00:34:38.753 --> 00:34:40.449
dejected and says I'm worthless,
etc.

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:44.784
That is--he's explaining the
kind of--that sort of state of

00:34:44.784 --> 00:34:49.195
dejection that love can bring
in--or the passion of love can

00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:50.989
bring into the mind.
 

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.529
The mind is clouded,
unable to think straight but

00:34:55.529 --> 00:35:01.393
that--for him also sheds light
on the way he understands poetry

00:35:01.393 --> 00:35:04.420
because he waits for poetry.
 

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.050
He's a sort of poet,
very romantic poet,

00:35:07.050 --> 00:35:10.489
who doesn't think that poetry
entails discipline.

00:35:10.489 --> 00:35:13.329
It's almost like somebody else
says,

00:35:13.329 --> 00:35:15.949
it's almost like going to the
office at 7:00 a.m.,

00:35:15.949 --> 00:35:18.969
you sit down at the desk,
and keep at it,

00:35:18.969 --> 00:35:22.639
and then maybe you'll manage to
come up with a great line.

00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:26.929
He hopes for--romantically for
poetry to come to him,

00:35:26.929 --> 00:35:30.684
for inspiration to come to him,
and then he realizes that his

00:35:30.684 --> 00:35:33.500
understanding of love was as
wrong as his--

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.233
of the love passion was as
wrong as his understanding of

00:35:36.233 --> 00:35:38.454
poetry,
that you've got to really get

00:35:38.454 --> 00:35:40.360
down and do something about it.
 

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.099
When he understands it,
it's too late for him,

00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:47.320
because Beatrice has died,
so now the poem--

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.380
the project of the Divine
Comedy--

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:54.692
she may be--he has a vision,
he sees her at the foot of

00:35:54.692 --> 00:36:00.398
God's majesty and says I want to
go there an meet with her,

00:36:00.398 --> 00:36:02.170
that's action.
 

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:06.539
You agree that that really is
quite--has completely changed.

00:36:06.539 --> 00:36:11.173
How does this understanding of
love connect with the courtly

00:36:11.173 --> 00:36:12.510
love tradition?
 

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:15.099
That is really not a difficult
question.

00:36:15.099 --> 00:36:19.780
In fact I would give you a
little bit of a bibliography

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.373
that C.S. Lewis has written a
very good book on The

00:36:24.373 --> 00:36:28.804
Allegory of Love,
a book written probably in the

00:36:28.804 --> 00:36:31.152
late 50s,
but last time I read it which

00:36:31.152 --> 00:36:33.210
was recently some twenty years
ago,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.539
it was still very good,
very powerful.

00:36:35.539 --> 00:36:39.920
The idea is this that--and I'm
really paraphrasing C.S. Lewis

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:43.132
more or less,
I mean with a lot of gaps in my

00:36:43.132 --> 00:36:46.199
mind about the richness of the
text.

00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:49.239
That clearly what we think of
love today as a romantic

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:51.762
understanding,
it's really a discovery of the

00:36:51.762 --> 00:36:52.679
Middle Ages.
 

00:36:52.679 --> 00:36:56.041
I have been talking about the
fact that, you may all recall,

00:36:56.041 --> 00:36:59.119
the Greeks did not have this
romantic understanding.

00:36:59.119 --> 00:37:01.920
The Romans didn't have this
understanding of love.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.309
When you read Catullus,
the passion for a woman is

00:37:07.309 --> 00:37:12.920
something that he's always a
little uneasy about.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.900
That's not what a virtuous man
should be doing.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.840
It's a weakness of the will.
 

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.876
The weakness of the will,
it's a vice,

00:37:19.876 --> 00:37:22.411
what can you do,
we are fallible--we are Romans

00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:25.219
but we are also occasionally a
little fallible.

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:30.545
The idea of romantic love comes
with Provencal poets in the

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:34.768
south of France,
what you call courtly love.

00:37:34.768 --> 00:37:36.974
I would distinguish that,
that's all, the only thing I

00:37:36.974 --> 00:37:37.849
would say about it.
 

00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:41.507
You don't read the C.S. Lewis
who ends up with love and the

00:37:41.507 --> 00:37:44.913
history of love in the--how it
changes, that is to say,

00:37:44.913 --> 00:37:46.489
in the Renaissance.
 

00:37:46.489 --> 00:37:48.050
I would distinguish between the
two;

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.682
I would not use
indiscriminately courtly love

00:37:50.682 --> 00:37:52.420
and medieval ideas of love.
 

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.077
Courtly love implies a
formalization of love and it

00:37:56.077 --> 00:37:58.311
goes back--
some of you I know are writing

00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:00.536
a paper on this,
on Andreas Capellanus,

00:38:00.536 --> 00:38:05.393
The Art of Courtly Love,
which is a way of setting rules

00:38:05.393 --> 00:38:09.811
for loves,
in the perception that love is

00:38:09.811 --> 00:38:16.126
a potentially disruptive
experience and so let us make it

00:38:16.126 --> 00:38:19.320
into a joke,
that's the idea.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.085
Let us establish protocols,
a code by means of which the

00:38:24.085 --> 00:38:28.936
woman and the man can really
interact and tell each other

00:38:28.936 --> 00:38:30.929
what this is about.
 

00:38:30.929 --> 00:38:34.818
Don't hope marriage because
that's a serious business

00:38:34.818 --> 00:38:38.762
concerning property,
and wealth, and status so

00:38:38.762 --> 00:38:43.474
within the fairly close
boundaries of the courtly love

00:38:43.474 --> 00:38:46.505
tradition,
then you go on making such

00:38:46.505 --> 00:38:48.909
assumptions about yourself
about--

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:55.980
you can play about the
greatness of women,

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.860
the secret of love,
there's a certain code.

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:04.940
In the other forms of courtly
love, or the sweet new style,

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:07.219
and the way it develops.
 

00:39:07.219 --> 00:39:14.898
Another book I could mention to
you is Valency which is love

00:39:14.898 --> 00:39:18.190
something--
I can't even remember the

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.193
title, Maurice Valency,
he also discusses the shifts

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:27.514
between Provencal understanding
of love and the sweet new style

00:39:27.514 --> 00:39:31.719
articulated by Dante and his
coterie of poets.

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:33.760
That makes it I hope.
 

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.291
Student:  Thank you for
an extraordinary series of

00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:47.860
lectures.
 

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.460
I was curious about the ending
and I wondered if you could

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.239
comment on Dante's views about
the papacy?

00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:58.521
I thought his choice of Bernard
of Clairvaux was very curious

00:39:58.521 --> 00:40:02.516
and throughout the Divine
Comedy he previously was

00:40:02.516 --> 00:40:05.871
grumbling about papal
intervention over temporal

00:40:05.871 --> 00:40:08.030
powers,
so I wondered if you could

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.280
comment on that conclusion.
 

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.300
Prof: Yeah,
very good question.

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:16.018
Of course I didn't talk about
it, and I think that what you're

00:40:16.018 --> 00:40:18.284
really referring to,
I don't know,

00:40:18.284 --> 00:40:21.739
but I think what you're
referring to is the fact that

00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:25.130
Bernard of Clairvaux wrote a
great book called,

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.309
On Consideration,
which seems to be about

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:29.730
contemplative life.
 

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:33.980
He's the great reformer of the
Benedictine movement,

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:39.762
monastic movement in France,
and the so called Cistercian

00:40:39.762 --> 00:40:45.646
monasteries which became the
centers of culture where they

00:40:45.646 --> 00:40:48.103
would copy--
they would do poetry,

00:40:48.103 --> 00:40:51.739
they would write music,
they would sing.

00:40:51.739 --> 00:40:54.739
I mean the arts,
the way we know them,

00:40:54.739 --> 00:40:57.090
really originated with him.
 

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.056
He wrote this text On
Consideration which

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.954
actually,
in spite of the title,

00:41:00.954 --> 00:41:04.190
because you know what
consideration is a step before

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.030
you come to contemplation.
 

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.938
There are a number--reflection,
consideration,

00:41:09.938 --> 00:41:12.110
and then contemplation.
 

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.980
He chooses to write on
consideration.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.463
He dedicates the book to--this
treatise to Pope Eugene IV who

00:41:20.463 --> 00:41:24.775
had been his disciple,
he had been a--a Frenchman who

00:41:24.775 --> 00:41:28.018
had been a Benedictine monk with
him and it's--

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:32.429
and this is probably one reason
why Dante chooses Bernard.

00:41:32.429 --> 00:41:36.570
Bernard, the contemplative
monk, the reformer,

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:40.817
all of Paradise is
populated with founders and

00:41:40.817 --> 00:41:45.141
great reformers,
founders of orders or Justinian

00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:46.750
and the law, etc.
 

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.860
France is Benedict,
Dominic, Bernard and so in

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:53.110
spite of the fact that he's a
contemplative,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:58.139
Bernard did not hesitate to
write a text for the spiritual

00:41:58.139 --> 00:42:02.329
edification of his ex-disciple,
Eugene the IV,

00:42:02.329 --> 00:42:06.838
who is now a Pope and he's
aware how the office of the

00:42:06.838 --> 00:42:11.516
shepherd of the church can
distract him from the loftier

00:42:11.516 --> 00:42:16.672
spiritual aims and the longings,
so it's really a sequence of

00:42:16.672 --> 00:42:19.010
arguments about what you
should--

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.219
how should you administer your
time so that you are never

00:42:23.219 --> 00:42:27.052
really going to lose sight of
what your true aim is,

00:42:27.052 --> 00:42:27.880
Heaven.
 

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.469
Dante mentions this text,
by the way,

00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:34.501
in a letter that so many--not
I, go on challenging the

00:42:34.501 --> 00:42:37.373
authority of,
the letter to Cangrande that

00:42:37.373 --> 00:42:38.967
maybe I have--
no not with you,

00:42:38.967 --> 00:42:41.000
with my graduate students we
have gone over,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.969
but to me that is actually the
indication,

00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:48.146
the fact that he refers to the
treatise by Bernard that the

00:42:48.146 --> 00:42:50.760
authority of--
he is the author of that letter.

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.364
Now, you see it clearly another
way in which I can understand

00:42:54.364 --> 00:42:57.547
your question is that you see
some kind of divergence,

00:42:57.547 --> 00:42:58.929
some sort of break.
 

00:42:58.929 --> 00:43:02.657
On the one hand this kind of
invective, the mode of the

00:43:02.657 --> 00:43:05.902
invective in Dante when talking
about Peter, St.

00:43:05.902 --> 00:43:08.320
Peter in Paradiso XXVII.
 

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:13.664
I mean, he doesn't--he looks
back after the examination on

00:43:13.664 --> 00:43:16.534
faith,
he looks back and he starts

00:43:16.534 --> 00:43:20.210
attacking what he takes to be
the use of patience,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.474
my place;
remember that,

00:43:22.474 --> 00:43:28.320
an incredibly moral voice that
rises right at the very end.

00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:32.103
You seem to be worried about
the fact that Dante seems to be

00:43:32.103 --> 00:43:34.806
so moral and--
when it comes about the popes

00:43:34.806 --> 00:43:37.349
and then becomes mystical all of
a sudden,

00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:38.920
is that really one of your
concerns?

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.907
It could be,
it could become one of your

00:43:40.907 --> 00:43:43.050
concerns in asking this question
about--

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.420
at the end of Paradise
XXXIII he talks about Bernard

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.849
such a mystic and yet all over
he has been talking about the

00:43:49.849 --> 00:43:50.489
papacy.
 

00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:55.567
If you were interested in that
I would say there is no

00:43:55.567 --> 00:44:01.601
divergence in Dante between the
prophetic voice and the mystical

00:44:01.601 --> 00:44:02.559
voice.
 

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:08.610
That is something--even those
who read the Bible would go on

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:13.329
saying, well,
the prophets were visionaries.

00:44:13.329 --> 00:44:15.998
In a way it's true but in a way
it's not true,

00:44:15.998 --> 00:44:19.025
the prophets were not
visionaries, the prophets were

00:44:19.025 --> 00:44:20.389
readers of history.
 

00:44:20.389 --> 00:44:24.900
They don't need to have Daniel
give an interpretation;

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:28.043
Ezekiel has visions,
but Isaiah doesn't have visions

00:44:28.043 --> 00:44:30.199
so it's--you see what I'm
saying?

00:44:30.199 --> 00:44:33.706
There is no clear-cut
distinction between the

00:44:33.706 --> 00:44:37.929
prophetic and the mystical,
certainly not in Dante.

00:44:37.929 --> 00:44:41.889
The two belong together so
that's--I don't know that I'm

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:46.208
answering your concerns but I
overheard a number of let's say

00:44:46.208 --> 00:44:48.440
rumblings in your question.
 

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:50.139
I'm trying to take care of them.
 

00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:53.860
Student:  Is it a
reconciliation with the papacy?

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:57.420
Prof: No,
not in the sense--no.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:03.105
To talk about--even Bernard is
someone who understands how

00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:09.389
waylaying the office can be and
he was obviously writing because

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:14.875
he must be aware of what has
been happening and what was

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:17.170
likely to happen.
 

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.934
You don't have to become a
chronicler or an historian to do

00:45:20.934 --> 00:45:23.800
that;
you can imagine this can happen.

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.139
No, there is not that.
 

00:45:26.139 --> 00:45:31.847
I think that's Dante's judgment
about history is always very

00:45:31.847 --> 00:45:34.460
clear until the very end.
 

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:41.230
History needs a reform and of
course he would say,

00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:44.608
because he's one who believes
in the sacramentality and

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:48.844
presence of the self,
how the self is crucial--before

00:45:48.844 --> 00:45:53.873
I start talking about how the
world needs reforming let me

00:45:53.873 --> 00:45:55.550
just begin here.
 

00:45:55.550 --> 00:46:00.099
That would be an obvious way to
say it,

00:46:00.099 --> 00:46:03.400
so I call it the language of
presence in him,

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.228
a sense of, I am present to my
own self and therefore I have

00:46:07.228 --> 00:46:10.800
responsibilities toward my own
self before I became--

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:16.320
I started using the megaphones
and let's reform the world.

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:20.387
That probably--if there were
ever to come and Dante's not a

00:46:20.387 --> 00:46:23.365
utopian thinker,
it would come only because so

00:46:23.365 --> 00:46:27.018
many people of good will,
men and women of good will,

00:46:27.018 --> 00:46:30.764
his saints,
his blessed--the blessed souls

00:46:30.764 --> 00:46:35.670
that he meets are willing to do
something about that.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.012
No, no reconciliation,
not a sense of finally things

00:46:39.012 --> 00:46:41.829
will be becoming together,
I don't think.

00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:44.250
Actually I hold onto that.
 

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:58.251
Student:  Just thinking
more about desire and wealth and

00:46:58.251 --> 00:47:01.978
the fact that the will is what
loves and the will always

00:47:01.978 --> 00:47:05.400
contains some element of lack,
or desire it seems,

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.391
so even if it can attain
plentitude it still seems that

00:47:08.391 --> 00:47:12.099
Dante in talking so much about
the will and the will as loving,

00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:15.659
Dante says that love always has
some element of lack.

00:47:15.659 --> 00:47:17.599
It's not just lack,
there is plentitude,

00:47:17.599 --> 00:47:20.489
but still there's always this
restlessness and so the love at

00:47:20.489 --> 00:47:22.851
the end where there is
plentitude it seems to be a

00:47:22.851 --> 00:47:25.260
completely transformed
understanding of love,

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.539
that it's not possible to
go--to return from in the

00:47:28.539 --> 00:47:29.719
beatific vision.
 

00:47:29.719 --> 00:47:32.532
If you have this plentitude,
is it possible to go back

00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:35.398
because it does seem like it's a
completely transformed

00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:38.688
understanding of love when you
have just the plentitude and not

00:47:38.688 --> 00:47:40.969
lack anymore so with that mind
does--

00:47:40.969 --> 00:47:44.036
is Dante ever able to attain
this love because this love that

00:47:44.036 --> 00:47:47.257
does have plentitude seems like
it should end in silence with no

00:47:47.257 --> 00:47:49.659
language and Dante does go back
and speak,

00:47:49.659 --> 00:47:53.596
and he does--he is still--he is
a pilgrim and a poet and so does

00:47:53.596 --> 00:47:57.157
he really ever move from the
images to the essences and is

00:47:57.157 --> 00:48:00.844
the uncertainty at the end not
just because we have to go on

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:04.969
the journey our self but because
he is still on the journey?

00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:12.724
Prof: Well,
you are really voicing a very

00:48:12.724 --> 00:48:17.510
delicate issue in the poem.
 

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:23.835
It's a very controversial issue
because that also implies the

00:48:23.835 --> 00:48:26.050
status of the poem.
 

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:27.699
Do you understand what I'm
saying?

00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:30.927
In other words,
if you really think that Dante

00:48:30.927 --> 00:48:33.277
has seen--
has had a beatific vision and

00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:36.338
he has,
and now he's writing the poem

00:48:36.338 --> 00:48:39.974
to tell us about it,
then you're really saying that

00:48:39.974 --> 00:48:42.972
the poem itself belongs to a
higher level of experience

00:48:42.972 --> 00:48:46.248
because it's written by someone
who is in full possession of

00:48:46.248 --> 00:48:46.860
grace.
 

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.429
That's your point, right?
 

00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:52.867
That's a very delicate point
because I have not been teaching

00:48:52.867 --> 00:48:55.530
Dante that way,
right, I have not.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.599
We are right to say this,
at the moment of

00:48:58.599 --> 00:49:02.043
recapitulation,
I probably would--I have wasted

00:49:02.043 --> 00:49:03.840
your time all along.
 

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.380
One little detail that I want
to bring to your attention and

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:10.079
then I will go to the more
general problem;

00:49:10.079 --> 00:49:13.920
when Dante meets Beatrice in
Purgatorio XXXI,

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:16.219
this is getting really to be a
recapitulation,

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:18.219
we're talking about everything
in the poem now,

00:49:18.219 --> 00:49:21.820
he meets Beatrice in
Purgatorio XXX and then

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:22.539
in XXXI.
 

00:49:22.539 --> 00:49:26.275
In Purgatorio XXXI
Beatrice forces Dante to go into

00:49:26.275 --> 00:49:27.260
a confession.
 

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.059
You have to go into an
admission of who you are,

00:49:31.059 --> 00:49:34.990
and has to be public;
cannot say I know you know,

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:39.594
but you have to be duly ashamed
because only that way you can

00:49:39.594 --> 00:49:43.659
transcend whatever it is that
you have within you.

00:49:43.659 --> 00:49:49.634
Dante reluctantly will agree to
do that and then Beatrice will

00:49:49.634 --> 00:49:52.594
say,
I want you to go through this

00:49:52.594 --> 00:49:56.003
so that another time,
the future tense,

00:49:56.003 --> 00:50:00.465
when you will see,
will meet the siren I want you

00:50:00.465 --> 00:50:01.840
to be stronger.
 

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.797
This to me implies,
that's one of the many--Dante

00:50:05.797 --> 00:50:09.510
sees Casella,
another aesthetic temptation.

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.070
One doesn't have to have the
temptation to kill someone,

00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:16.097
to really feel that what is
out--has fallen out of grace but

00:50:16.097 --> 00:50:18.920
this is--
he meets Casella and he

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:24.139
remembers how sweet was that
song he heard from Casella and

00:50:24.139 --> 00:50:28.010
that sweetness still resounds
within me.

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:33.077
Now Dante is writing--is
talking as a poet--he meets

00:50:33.077 --> 00:50:37.250
Ulysses, I grieve then and I
grieve now.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:43.402
There is a way in which states
within the pilgrim do not really

00:50:43.402 --> 00:50:46.335
go on changing;
they are the same,

00:50:46.335 --> 00:50:50.005
implying that there is some
kind of continuity between

00:50:50.005 --> 00:50:52.289
pilgrimage and poetry writing.
 

00:50:52.289 --> 00:50:57.519
To me, the writing of poetry is
an extension of the pilgrimage.

00:50:57.519 --> 00:51:02.429
Dante though goes on saying;
I have had the beatific vision.

00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:05.940
I am now--I know what enjoyment
means,

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.039
not just desire,
but I'm coming back to the

00:51:09.039 --> 00:51:12.951
Earth and therefore I cannot
come back to the Earth as

00:51:12.951 --> 00:51:17.010
anything less than a human being
with one project,

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:21.244
the project to write a poem,
because I want to retrieve that

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:24.329
joy and because I want to share
that joy.

00:51:24.329 --> 00:51:27.500
So I have set down two things
in my answer to you.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.896
One talking about the question
of the pilgrim's experience and

00:51:31.896 --> 00:51:35.501
the relationship of the
pilgrim's experience to the

00:51:35.501 --> 00:51:40.496
writing of a poem,
but I have also said that the

00:51:40.496 --> 00:51:43.949
poem stands as a sign for us.
 

00:51:43.949 --> 00:51:49.646
A hermeneutical moment;
Dante means it for us so that

00:51:49.646 --> 00:51:52.690
we can--his journey continues.
 

00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:55.789
That's my answer.
 

00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:59.018
You don't have to agree with it
because there are--

00:51:59.018 --> 00:52:02.480
I know there is--there are
other people,

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.632
I have been fighting those
people for a long time in my

00:52:05.632 --> 00:52:07.608
life,
I don't want to go back to

00:52:07.608 --> 00:52:10.351
those fights,
but I think that that this my

00:52:10.351 --> 00:52:12.159
way of looking at it,
okay.

00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:13.679
I can give you more
bibliography;

00:52:13.679 --> 00:52:16.599
I would rather not actually,
to tell you the truth.

00:52:16.599 --> 00:52:19.012
I don't want to tell you about
those people who are writing the

00:52:19.012 --> 00:52:19.480
other way.
 

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.780
I have written about them in my
books.

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:34.922
Student:  I was
wondering if you could talk a

00:52:34.922 --> 00:52:37.000
little bit more about how Dante
views other religions.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.664
In particular,
Judaism and if it sort of falls

00:52:40.664 --> 00:52:44.409
underneath his idea of religion
as freedom,

00:52:44.409 --> 00:52:48.269
and that if you have the
freedom to become an atheist you

00:52:48.269 --> 00:52:52.476
also have the freedom to choose
a different religion and if he

00:52:52.476 --> 00:52:56.474
views Judaism and Christianity
as sort of a continuity both

00:52:56.474 --> 00:53:00.405
deriving from the same basis or
if he ascribes the idea of

00:53:00.405 --> 00:53:04.197
secessionism that Christianity
has succeeded Judaism and

00:53:04.197 --> 00:53:07.376
invalidates it,
and for that reason we don't

00:53:07.376 --> 00:53:10.710
find, from what I can remember,
and Jews in Paradise.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.159
Prof: Oh yes you do.
 

00:53:12.159 --> 00:53:12.989
Student:  You do?
 

00:53:12.989 --> 00:53:13.639
Okay then that's my fault.
 

00:53:13.639 --> 00:53:15.793
Prof: Well,
now I have to correct you

00:53:15.793 --> 00:53:17.820
immediately because then maybe
you rephrase it--

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.007
stay there--because you
probably will rephrase the

00:53:20.007 --> 00:53:20.500
question.
 

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:26.425
When Dante goes on listing,
in the mystical rose,

00:53:26.425 --> 00:53:32.969
we even are told that Beatrice
sits next to Rachel.

00:53:32.969 --> 00:53:38.128
She has a way of elevating her
and then he goes on describing

00:53:38.128 --> 00:53:42.942
all the other--we talked at
length about Solomon who is a

00:53:42.942 --> 00:53:44.920
Jew, I think right?
 

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.679
He was a Jew in the Bible.
 

00:53:46.679 --> 00:53:51.226
We went on talking about
Nathan, I tried to make light of

00:53:51.226 --> 00:53:56.259
it because I wanted to tell you
that Dante saw his own name but

00:53:56.259 --> 00:53:59.050
it's Nathan,
a prophet of David,

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:03.730
and also in the harrowing of
hell which is Inferno IV,

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:07.539
where Dante describes what
happens to Jesus after his

00:54:07.539 --> 00:54:09.780
death,
what does he do?

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:11.570
He harrows hell.
 

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:12.369
He goes into hell.
 

00:54:12.369 --> 00:54:13.739
What is he doing in hell?
 

00:54:13.739 --> 00:54:16.719
He goes there to take the
patriarchs and the women of

00:54:16.719 --> 00:54:18.610
Israel and take them to heaven.
 

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:22.255
That's--these are facts--you
want to change your question or

00:54:22.255 --> 00:54:25.963
I can go on telling you more and
answering the real questions

00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:29.505
that you are raising,
that is to say the relationship

00:54:29.505 --> 00:54:33.130
between Christianity and Judaism
and the other religions.

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:34.980
You want me to talk about that?
 

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.295
Student:  That's
definitely the issue that I

00:54:37.295 --> 00:54:37.619
have.
 

00:54:37.619 --> 00:54:38.989
Whether Dante--I guess like I
said before,

00:54:38.989 --> 00:54:43.275
I guess by having Jews in
Paradise and having the

00:54:43.275 --> 00:54:47.559
figure of Christ come in and
collect the patriarchs,

00:54:47.559 --> 00:54:52.114
if he's trying to integrate
Judaism within Christianity or

00:54:52.114 --> 00:54:55.309
somehow to find a way between
the two?

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:56.402
Prof: Yes.
 

00:54:56.402 --> 00:55:00.195
That is--so you're interested
especially about Dante's sense

00:55:00.195 --> 00:55:03.860
of--the relationship between
Christianity and Judaism?

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:07.338
Do you want me to also address
the other issue of the way he

00:55:07.338 --> 00:55:09.579
looks at the Hindus and the
Muslims?

00:55:09.579 --> 00:55:12.469
We talked about Dante and the
other religions.

00:55:12.469 --> 00:55:15.740
In fact, when I--when we talked
about Dante's relationship with

00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:18.380
a sense of Christianity to the
other religions,

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.300
I never mentioned the Jews and
probably that to you may have

00:55:22.300 --> 00:55:24.559
been a kind of glaring omission.
 

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:27.202
This guy is talking about the
big religions,

00:55:27.202 --> 00:55:29.969
what about the matriarchs of
the religions?

00:55:29.969 --> 00:55:34.202
The Judaism--it's likely--I
occasionally thought maybe I

00:55:34.202 --> 00:55:37.391
should say something,
and then I said no because

00:55:37.391 --> 00:55:39.820
Dante doesn't talk about it and
so I wouldn't.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:44.949
Dante does talk when he
has--and he is not the only one,

00:55:44.949 --> 00:55:48.920
centuries before him they were
talking--

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:54.480
a man like--a great theologian
by the name of Bonaventure,

00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.960
a professor of theology at the
University of Paris.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:03.217
I mentioned that text I'm sure,
and the year 1274 which is also

00:56:03.217 --> 00:56:07.389
the year of his death,
he was invited to Paris,

00:56:07.389 --> 00:56:10.065
he was teaching there,
because he was invited to

00:56:10.065 --> 00:56:12.489
deliver a number of lectures and
he gives these lectures,

00:56:12.489 --> 00:56:16.920
and then he goes on talking
about the other religions,

00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:22.409
the religions he knows:
Hindu and the Muslim religion.

00:56:22.409 --> 00:56:26.621
It's an argument--I mention
that because it seems to me that

00:56:26.621 --> 00:56:31.190
Dante follows Bonaventure fairly
closely when in the canto of St.

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.402
Francis, Canto X,
the description of the--that

00:56:34.402 --> 00:56:35.331
legend of St.
 

00:56:35.331 --> 00:56:39.400
Francis, Francis is said to
have gone to the sultan to try

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:45.347
to convert him and fails,
and then Dante also talks of

00:56:45.347 --> 00:56:49.237
the Hindus,
with the reference to the

00:56:49.237 --> 00:56:49.969
Ganges.
 

00:56:49.969 --> 00:56:53.449
When talking about justice,
Dante is talking about Europe,

00:56:53.449 --> 00:56:57.282
but in between he alludes to
the--he talks about the Persians

00:56:57.282 --> 00:57:00.434
and the Hindu,
the guy from the Hin who is

00:57:00.434 --> 00:57:04.019
born on the river Hindus,
he says you are of the Hindus.

00:57:04.019 --> 00:57:07.510
What is the conception there?
 

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:10.434
The critique,
they are talking as Christians

00:57:10.434 --> 00:57:14.650
and they are talking from the
point of view of Christianity.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:19.440
The position that Bonaventure
will have, and Dante I think

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.130
follows him, is the following.
 

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:26.079
How does it--how it can be--can
they be distinguished?

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:27.409
What do they share?
 

00:57:27.409 --> 00:57:29.039
They talk about what they share.
 

00:57:29.039 --> 00:57:30.730
What do they have in common?
 

00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:35.860
They have in common,
especially with the case of the

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:40.489
Muslims, the biblical--the
Jewish tradition.

00:57:40.489 --> 00:57:44.393
Let me just not mince words
here, the Jewish tradition,

00:57:44.393 --> 00:57:47.429
that's really the common matrix
for him.

00:57:47.429 --> 00:57:51.679
He also notices differences,
that for instance,

00:57:51.679 --> 00:57:56.300
the theology of the Hindus is
one that presumes the

00:57:56.300 --> 00:58:00.090
diffusiveness of God into all
things.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:04.539
That's not--I don't think
that's something that unusual.

00:58:04.539 --> 00:58:06.000
What does it imply?
 

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.878
Because they become critical of
it, it then implies the

00:58:10.878 --> 00:58:16.300
difficulty of making judgments
about what's good and evil.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:20.518
If God is everywhere you have
to--the sacrality of all things,

00:58:20.518 --> 00:58:23.228
which is a great idea,
and yet there are some aspects

00:58:23.228 --> 00:58:26.197
of reality where you don't like
to think that they are all

00:58:26.197 --> 00:58:26.719
alike.
 

00:58:26.719 --> 00:58:31.380
There is a way in which--this
is pantheism and can become--

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.027
therefore can become--can be
critiqued as the lack of

00:58:36.027 --> 00:58:40.050
distinctions and hierarchies,
and ordering.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:44.422
When they come to the Muslims,
since the Muslim religion is

00:58:44.422 --> 00:58:48.570
one that talks about the
absolute impenetrability of the

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:52.869
human mind cannot ever hope to
understand the Divine.

00:58:52.869 --> 00:58:57.726
We are here at the mercy of God
and we live only by the mercy of

00:58:57.726 --> 00:58:58.190
God.
 

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:01.597
We cannot go on and say,
but I live by reason and I die

00:59:01.597 --> 00:59:04.059
by reason, and I can get to know
God.

00:59:04.059 --> 00:59:07.873
There is a great distance
between the human and the

00:59:07.873 --> 00:59:08.559
Divine.
 

00:59:08.559 --> 00:59:10.230
That's the critique.
 

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:13.650
If this is true then we have
nothing to--

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.387
there is an absolute
transcendence and he sees

00:59:16.387 --> 00:59:19.793
Christianity as that which
literally mediates between the

00:59:19.793 --> 00:59:22.896
two because there is that
transcendence and absolute

00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:26.601
transcendence of God,
the way the Muslims understand

00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:30.070
it, but there is also a
possibility of a mediation.

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:33.010
Not total mediation the way the
Hindus understand it,

00:59:33.010 --> 00:59:35.894
but the mediation of the cross,
the mediation of the

00:59:35.894 --> 00:59:36.800
incarnation.
 

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.219
This is the way Dante takes the
other religions.

00:59:39.219 --> 00:59:42.268
When it comes to the pagan
religions,

00:59:42.268 --> 00:59:45.768
not because they are the pagan
religions for instance,

00:59:45.768 --> 00:59:51.320
and Dante there follows very
much the pagan religion,

00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.768
the religion of the Greeks,
the religion of the Romans.

00:59:53.768 --> 00:59:55.793
Dante follows very much St.
 

00:59:55.793 --> 00:59:59.989
Augustine, who is the one who
talks at length about these

00:59:59.989 --> 01:00:00.739
issues.
 

01:00:00.739 --> 01:00:06.079
That's the ambiguity;
there are adumbrations of the

01:00:06.079 --> 01:00:10.641
Divine, but at the same time,
they can become also

01:00:10.641 --> 01:00:14.739
blasphemous idols of the
infernal powers.

01:00:14.739 --> 01:00:17.755
There is this way of really the
smashing, if you wish,

01:00:17.755 --> 01:00:18.610
of the idols.
 

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.757
When it comes to Judaism,
which is really the question

01:00:22.757 --> 01:00:25.889
that--with which you started
actually.

01:00:25.889 --> 01:00:31.889
I think that Dante is--I talked
about that.

01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.579
I shouldn't say that I didn't
talk about it.

01:00:33.579 --> 01:00:39.059
You may recall that I made a
point in--

01:00:39.059 --> 01:00:42.690
at the beginning of the
readings of the poem,

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:47.550
maybe I was not--it didn't seem
to be very important,

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:51.469
it was important to me;
I sort of went on talking a

01:00:51.469 --> 01:00:56.210
little bit at length about the
question of birth.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:00.829
You remember how there are some
characters, representations,

01:01:00.829 --> 01:01:02.159
all characters?
 

01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.329
Dante continues,
I could have said the same

01:01:04.329 --> 01:01:06.190
thing in the prayer to the
Virgin;

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:09.730
Virgin, mother,
daughter of your son;

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:14.530
two birds in one stone,
in half a line as it were.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:18.210
Daughter of your son,
Dante focuses on birth.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:20.869
I did say, I went on talking
since--

01:01:20.869 --> 01:01:22.380
Dante talks like this about
Virgil,

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:25.840
then talks about the birth of
Francesca,

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.070
Giacco in Canto VI,
Farinata in Canto X,

01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:32.429
endlessly talks about this
whole issue.

01:01:32.429 --> 01:01:36.871
Then I went on talking,
this concern with birth is

01:01:36.871 --> 01:01:39.500
specifically Roman,
I said.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:44.757
This is really a Roman insight
into the importance--it's really

01:01:44.757 --> 01:01:49.929
what distinguishes the Greek
tragic understanding of birth.

01:01:49.929 --> 01:01:52.500
Children can really become a
curse in--

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:56.268
when you read the
Thebaid, for instance,

01:01:56.268 --> 01:01:57.929
where you read the story of
Oedipus,

01:01:57.929 --> 01:02:02.349
with Statius being half Greek,
sort of incorporates.

01:02:02.349 --> 01:02:05.007
Then I added,
after saying that this a Roman

01:02:05.007 --> 01:02:08.407
concern, because it's the
whole--it's tied to the notion

01:02:08.407 --> 01:02:09.518
of foundation.
 

01:02:09.518 --> 01:02:12.987
The Roman idea that you can
start things over and over again

01:02:12.987 --> 01:02:16.514
with the foundations of cities
and the birth being the way in

01:02:16.514 --> 01:02:19.498
which nature becomes historical,
and therefore,

01:02:19.498 --> 01:02:22.445
I potentially like all of you
potentially can change

01:02:22.445 --> 01:02:23.889
everything around you.
 

01:02:23.889 --> 01:02:26.188
It's not true,
as someone at a round table the

01:02:26.188 --> 01:02:29.050
other night in my department,
was saying that you have no

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:30.889
experience, there are no events.
 

01:02:30.889 --> 01:02:33.219
Of course there are experiences
and events,

01:02:33.219 --> 01:02:36.400
every birth is an event,
that's Dante's understanding

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.469
because he can change history,
he can change the future.

01:02:39.469 --> 01:02:42.545
After making these statements
that that's a Roman idea,

01:02:42.545 --> 01:02:45.280
and or Dante that's crucial
because he's a Roman,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.559
and he thinks of himself as a
Roman;

01:02:47.559 --> 01:02:50.268
Florence is the daughter of
Rome.

01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:55.699
Then I added that this is also
a Jewish idea of creation.

01:02:55.699 --> 01:02:59.186
That that's really what we
have, mainly the great invention

01:02:59.186 --> 01:03:03.588
that we have in the Bible,
that the world was created and

01:03:03.588 --> 01:03:06.869
that Dante is connecting two
ideas,

01:03:06.869 --> 01:03:10.677
a Roman and a Jewish idea,
which are miraculously

01:03:10.677 --> 01:03:11.710
convergent.
 

01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:16.000
Is this an act of useful
patience because that's really

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.860
the--what I read in your
question.

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.065
Is that an appropriation?
 

01:03:21.065 --> 01:03:22.300
It's culture.
 

01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.625
I think that that's really what
you do, but you can say that

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:26.639
about the Bible.
 

01:03:26.639 --> 01:03:30.514
You read, the Bible is a
reading of history,

01:03:30.514 --> 01:03:33.760
over 800 years of its
composition.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.949
It's a reading of events around
them and the culture,

01:03:37.949 --> 01:03:40.929
and that's exactly what Dante
does.

01:03:40.929 --> 01:03:46.650
How does he look at--he thinks
that the Jews--

01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.259
I guess he's really saying they
are not Christians but they

01:03:50.259 --> 01:03:53.619
believe in a Christ to come and
that will save them.

01:03:53.619 --> 01:03:58.393
This really means that there is
an acknowledgement of the

01:03:58.393 --> 01:04:02.739
dignity and certainly
originality of that vision.

01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:05.291
I answered clearly;
you may agree,

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:07.349
you may not agree,
but it's clear.

01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:08.840
We agree about that.
 

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:30.608
Student:  I was
wondering if you could just

01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:34.023
brief--
I was wondering if you could

01:04:34.023 --> 01:04:38.148
discuss the presence of violence
in all of these texts that we've

01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:39.179
been reading.
 

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:44.166
I'm thinking particularly about
the Vita nuova and the

01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:49.155
depiction of violence in these
dreams filled with passion and

01:04:49.155 --> 01:04:54.059
very strange representations of
the color red and all--

01:04:54.059 --> 01:04:59.141
as both a lustful color,
the fear of death in these

01:04:59.141 --> 01:05:05.643
depictions of love which reminds
me of courtly love and this idea

01:05:05.643 --> 01:05:12.250
that our passions are sort of
transcendental violent dreams,

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:14.079
and images that come to us.
 

01:05:14.079 --> 01:05:17.398
That's one question,
one part, but the other is the

01:05:17.398 --> 01:05:21.579
presence of violence and violent
imagery in Paradiso,

01:05:21.579 --> 01:05:25.699
I'm thinking particularly about
marshes at the beginning in

01:05:25.699 --> 01:05:26.409
Canto I?
 

01:05:26.409 --> 01:05:31.657
Also, the implied moral
violation of Piccarda and these

01:05:31.657 --> 01:05:37.878
continuous images that remind us
of human violence and passion as

01:05:37.878 --> 01:05:42.855
violence,
and I wonder how they fit in

01:05:42.855 --> 01:05:49.440
with the final vision of
beatitude and human love?

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:55.280
Prof: That brings us
right back to the relationship

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.380
between the historical and the
sacred.

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:05.960
Violence is a parody almost of
the sacred,

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.041
and in many ways,
the alibi for the sacred

01:06:09.041 --> 01:06:13.400
because the sacred has to be
understood as that which tries

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:15.429
to redeem the violence.
 

01:06:15.429 --> 01:06:20.753
And Dante, you're absolutely
right, never flinches from the

01:06:20.753 --> 01:06:26.262
understanding that the world of
history is an economy of this

01:06:26.262 --> 01:06:27.822
ongoing violence.
 

01:06:27.822 --> 01:06:29.199
It's true.
 

01:06:29.199 --> 01:06:35.010
He even addresses you, right.
 

01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:39.170
The human beings,
the Cato who kills himself

01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:44.782
hoping that with his death he
can bring an end to the civil

01:06:44.782 --> 01:06:49.039
war in Rome between Caesar and
Pompeii,

01:06:49.039 --> 01:06:53.518
but then the violence
that--someone like Piccarda.

01:06:53.518 --> 01:06:57.152
How love engenders violence,
it's an incredibly thing,

01:06:57.152 --> 01:06:59.690
because then they have
perversions.

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:03.827
It's not just that I killed
because I want to steal

01:07:03.827 --> 01:07:07.360
someone's shoes,
but then there is a way in

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.190
which I think I'm engaged a more
tragic understanding of violence

01:07:12.190 --> 01:07:15.815
because a sort it--
it's so mediated and so

01:07:15.815 --> 01:07:17.440
disguised as love.
 

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.583
I can love, from Paolo and
Francesca, and yet that

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:24.119
engenders a lot of violence.
 

01:07:24.119 --> 01:07:28.500
Dante has gone through all the
phases for this sort of

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:29.409
thinking.
 

01:07:29.409 --> 01:07:32.507
That of thinking that maybe
that's really what history is

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.338
about;
it's all about violence and

01:07:35.338 --> 01:07:40.666
that any effort at redemption,
Christ's redemption of

01:07:40.666 --> 01:07:47.023
violence, that's really what the
whole story of Christian

01:07:47.023 --> 01:07:49.518
salvation is about.
 

01:07:49.518 --> 01:07:52.630
Dante mentions that,
this is not a kind of an

01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:56.730
opinion, Dante will mention it
in Inferno XXXIII.

01:07:56.730 --> 01:08:00.760
Remember, with the story of
Ugolino,

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:05.351
in the background of that
scene, of that famous

01:08:05.351 --> 01:08:09.246
cannibalizing,
that is the story of the

01:08:09.246 --> 01:08:13.182
children have been killed,
two of his children,

01:08:13.182 --> 01:08:17.028
and that's always the death of
the innocent is really the

01:08:17.028 --> 01:08:19.279
beginning--
what happens to the children?

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:22.908
We can go on arguing but what
about these kids?

01:08:22.908 --> 01:08:25.569
We have no response of what is
innocent as Dante says,

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:28.760
and then you overhear in the
background,

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.712
and I think that Dante wants us
to overhear the experience of

01:08:33.712 --> 01:08:38.333
the cross that was meant to
redeem of violence but didn't

01:08:38.333 --> 01:08:41.992
seem to work,
so there is a way in which he

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:45.720
thinks violence has--
to the notion and to the god of

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:50.060
violence,
even the redemption succumbs to

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:51.569
that vision.
 

01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:56.658
The idea of redemption loses in
connection with--and in relation

01:08:56.658 --> 01:08:57.788
to violence.
 

01:08:57.788 --> 01:09:04.060
That would be the way we can
come to understand it.

01:09:04.060 --> 01:09:06.180
There are a number of other
extensions,

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:10.390
even when we read Dante will
say, when we read,

01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:13.494
it seems to be such an
innocuous bland operation that

01:09:13.494 --> 01:09:17.194
we're engaged in,
in the quiet of our studies,

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:21.934
etc., then we are still
violating the integrity of the

01:09:21.934 --> 01:09:22.649
text.
 

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:26.220
We still extract,
we still break up that unity,

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:30.970
we isolate the passage,
we make part of what we want,

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:34.720
what we want it to signify,
hermeneutics is linked,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.340
interpretation is linked to an
experience of violence.

01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.899
What gives?
 

01:09:38.899 --> 01:09:41.904
We agree there,
that was your question,

01:09:41.904 --> 01:09:46.729
how does Dante get beyond that
and somehow manage to arrive to

01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:48.470
a beatific vision?
 

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:53.368
I think that what Dante is
doing is denouncing all forms of

01:09:53.368 --> 01:09:57.086
violence, confessing to them,
admitting them,

01:09:57.086 --> 01:09:58.859
dramatizing them.
 

01:09:58.859 --> 01:10:01.685
It doesn't mean that he's
espousing them or he shares

01:10:01.685 --> 01:10:04.028
them,
the whole point of the

01:10:04.028 --> 01:10:08.149
Divine Comedy is to
acknowledge that it lodges --

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:11.850
it, violence -- lodges even in
him and within him,

01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:16.868
but he wants to move beyond it
and that's the ascetic aspect of

01:10:16.868 --> 01:10:20.252
his text,
ascetic in the sense that he's

01:10:20.252 --> 01:10:25.159
literally climbing up the ladder
of transcending that which is

01:10:25.159 --> 01:10:26.770
holding him back.
 

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.868
I don't think that--if you are
looking for way that--does he

01:10:30.868 --> 01:10:32.189
get away from it?
 

01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:36.368
That's really the other
question, does he ever get away?

01:10:36.368 --> 01:10:40.712
Not in the measure in which
he's human and wants to remain

01:10:40.712 --> 01:10:44.369
human, open to these temptations
all the time.

01:10:53.289 --> 01:10:54.449
Please.
 

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:05.228
Student:  As a pilgrim
who has become a senior citizen

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:08.800
I have had a question throughout
the entire course,

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:13.341
and having read Auerbach and
Thomas Bergen and Mary Reynolds

01:11:13.341 --> 01:11:15.743
and others,
the question has not been

01:11:15.743 --> 01:11:18.340
answered for me and I'm not sure
you can either.

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:22.760
The question is who is Dante?
 

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.623
As we've been responding to
these--you've been responding to

01:11:25.623 --> 01:11:28.527
these questions here,
I've jotted down human,

01:11:28.527 --> 01:11:31.306
man, citizen,
exile, lover,

01:11:31.306 --> 01:11:34.729
poet, pilgrim,
visionary,

01:11:34.729 --> 01:11:42.640
theologian, saint,
Paul, Teresa of Avila,

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.198
John of the Cross,
Bernard of Clairvaux had their

01:11:45.198 --> 01:11:46.960
visions and they became saints.
 

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.470
Is this man a saint?
 

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:56.746
Prof: Well,
I'm taking a little bit of time

01:11:56.746 --> 01:12:04.300
to answer because you must know;
I think you know that actually

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.680
there are people who think that
he should be canonized.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.399
You probably do not know that.
 

01:12:09.399 --> 01:12:11.770
Who think that he should be
canonized.

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:14.712
Actually, I was actually
interviewed once about

01:12:14.712 --> 01:12:16.118
soliciting my ideas.
 

01:12:16.118 --> 01:12:21.163
I said I hope not because I
want to teach him for what I

01:12:21.163 --> 01:12:24.923
think he is a poet,
a man of extraordinary

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:28.408
imagination who divinies our
time.

01:12:28.408 --> 01:12:31.658
That's what I think he is,
the power of the imagination,

01:12:31.658 --> 01:12:36.416
and who understands that the
greatest call on him and on us

01:12:36.416 --> 01:12:41.420
is really the possibility of the
encounter with the Divine.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:44.530
I don't know--I hate the
idea--if I were to make a movie

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:47.280
about Dante--
I have been--sometimes when

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.904
people have been--
I have been mentioning it to

01:12:51.904 --> 01:12:59.411
people actually I would make him
into a rebellious type who seems

01:12:59.411 --> 01:13:04.689
to understand everything that he
touches,

01:13:04.689 --> 01:13:08.546
but he also has a way and
takes, as he should from

01:13:08.546 --> 01:13:10.975
everything,
and transforms it,

01:13:10.975 --> 01:13:14.220
so he has a vision from that
point of view.

01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:18.270
The vision of how the world is
and--he invents the world,

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:21.744
his world, the world of the
Divine Comedy,

01:13:21.744 --> 01:13:24.350
it's an extraordinary
invention.

01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:26.908
But a saint?
 

01:13:26.908 --> 01:13:32.387
I don't know what these other
guys have done exactly to make

01:13:32.387 --> 01:13:37.680
them deserving of sainthood but
maybe I'll leave it there,

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.260
I don't know.
 

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:39.876
Thank you.
 

01:13:39.876 --> 01:13:40.984
I think it's time.
 

01:13:40.984 --> 01:13:43.572
Thank you so much for your
great questions,

01:13:43.572 --> 01:13:44.250
thanks.
 

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:46.890
&gt;

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.915
Professor David Blight:
It used to be said that in

00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:10.961
the old wars fought by the Irish
clans that they had an

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.821
agreement.
I don't know if this is true,

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.820
but I love the idea,
that no matter how much they

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.006
slaughter themselves with
broadswords and knives and

00:00:20.006 --> 00:00:22.380
whatever else those maniacs
used,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
that they should always spare
the poets.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.407
Don't kill the poets,
because the poets had to be

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:30.630
left to tell the story.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.270
Most great poets don't go to
war, they write.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.040
This week you're reading a
great poet, E.L.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.260
Doctorow, a poet in prose,
a poet in fiction.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.324
Doctorow, as some of you must
know, is a famous American

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:56.640
writer for his historical
fiction.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.108
Much of his fiction is often
very historical and you'll find,

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:03.789
if anyone takes the time some
day,

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.329
that large chunks of the
monologue you hear from William

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:13.199
Tecumseh Sherman in this novel
is directly out of his famous

00:01:13.199 --> 00:01:16.593
memoirs,
and then every now and then

00:01:16.593 --> 00:01:20.510
Doctorow will embellish or add a
few lines.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.577
Most of the people in this book
were real people,

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:27.814
but there are some invented.
In some ways,

00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:30.911
possibly the most brilliant
inventions in this book are the

00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:35.008
slave characters,
or the freedman characters,

00:01:35.008 --> 00:01:40.840
and what Doctorow does with
them through this sort of

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.989
anguished crucible of all out
war.

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:49.410
Look especially for those
journeys into Sherman's own

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.915
mind, Sherman's psyche,
those meditations of Sherman's

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:57.718
on death.
Page 88 and 89 to be exact is,

00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:02.394
I think, an unforgettable
mediation by Sherman on the

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:07.970
meaning of death and just what
it means and why he in some ways

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.320
enjoys it.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.630
Herman Melville wrote a whole
bunch of poems during the Civil

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.120
War.
He was one of the poets spared.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.736
He wasn't very famous yet,
as you know,

00:02:23.736 --> 00:02:28.220
for Moby Dick;
that was to come later.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.629
Maybe our greatest writer of
the nineteenth century;

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.723
also wrote a lot of poetry,
and he wrote almost all of his

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:39.922
poetry during the Civil War,
as did, by the way,

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:43.396
Emily Dickinson.
Don't know if any of you are

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:46.047
Emily Dickinson fans,
but Emily, the Belle of

00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:48.897
Amherst,
wrote between 900 and 1000

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:53.020
poems in her life,
and fully two-thirds of them in

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.997
the four years of the war.
She became obsessed with the

00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:01.893
idea of the war,
and if you read her closely

00:03:01.893 --> 00:03:05.790
enough it's all over her wartime
poetry.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.736
She became obsessed with death.
Our greatest death poet was,

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:15.849
of course, Whitman;
more from him later.

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.663
But one little piece by
Melville, because it's about

00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:21.230
you.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.067
This was Melville's meditation
in poetry on the death of

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:32.526
college students in the war.
It's called "On the Slain

00:03:32.526 --> 00:03:35.068
Collegians."
It's timeless,

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:40.027
it could be about any war,
although collegians don't go to

00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:43.160
war anymore very much in
America.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.168
"Youth is the time when hearts
are large and stirring wars

00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:51.176
appeal to the spirit which
appeals in turn to the blade it

00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:54.059
draws.
If woman in sight and duties

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:58.729
show, though made the mask of
Cane, or whether it be truth,

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.906
sacred cause,
who can aloof remain that

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:08.511
shares youth's ardor,
uncooled by the snow of wisdom

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:12.596
or sordid gain?
Woe for the homes of the North

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:16.523
and woe for the seats of the
South, all who felt life spring

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:20.649
in prime and were swept by the
wind of their place in time.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:26.173
Oh lavish hearts on whichever
side of birth or bane or courage

00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:31.426
high, arm them for the stirring
wars, arm them some to die,

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:36.953
Apollo-like in pride.
Each slay his python caught,

00:04:36.953 --> 00:04:40.800
the maxims in his temple
taught.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.209
The anguish of maternal hearts
must search for balm divine.

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:49.156
But well the striplings bore
their faded parts,

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:52.160
the heaven all parts must
assign.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:59.347
Never felt life's care or cloy.
Each bloomed and died an abated

00:04:59.347 --> 00:05:03.871
boy, nor dreamed what death was,
thought it mere sliding into

00:05:03.871 --> 00:05:07.899
some vernal sphere.
They knew the joy but leaped

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:11.265
the grief.
Like plants that flower 'ere

00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:16.746
comes the leaf which storms lay
low in kindly doom and kill them

00:05:16.746 --> 00:05:19.530
in the flush of their bloom."

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.371
The casualties in the Union
Army alone, the Army of the

00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:31.344
Potomac, Grant's army,
from the first of May through

00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:35.097
the end of July 1864,
in this horrible war of

00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:39.790
attrition and the stalemate it
produced in Virginia,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.820
the casualties in that one army
in about two to two-and-a-half

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.939
months was 66,000 men.
It is the largest loss of life

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.005
in the shortest period of time
in all of American military

00:05:53.005 --> 00:05:58.190
history.
How did it get to that?

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.569
Why did the war go on,
and on and on?

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.769
Well let's begin with Grant and
Lee, these two great warriors

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:12.946
around whose names,
symbols, actions,

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:19.555
decisions a good deal of the
war would hinge in the final

00:06:19.555 --> 00:06:22.670
year.
Grant, from his successes in

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.319
the West--fall of Vicksburg,
siege and fall of Chattanooga,

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.040
the victory at
Chickamauga--came East,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.470
appointed by Abraham Lincoln as
General of the Army.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:43.075
Congress actually revived a
special rank that it hadn't used

00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:46.882
in years called
Lieutenant-General,

00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:51.726
just for Grant.
He came East and was appointed

00:06:51.726 --> 00:06:55.982
head of all Union Armies,
on any front anywhere,

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:58.880
in March of 1864,
winter '64.

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.664
He was wined and dined at the
White House and wined and dined

00:07:04.664 --> 00:07:07.817
in Congress.
They had to keep telling him to

00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:11.620
put on a decent uniform.
There's a lot of truth to this

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.819
idea of Grant the kind of humble
plebian.

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:16.930
He had after all been doing
nothing but work in his

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.289
brother's leather shop in
Galena, Illinois when the war

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.270
broke out.
But, boy, did he have a nose

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:28.629
for war.
He was a great horseman.

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:33.564
They said he could canter like
nobody else and gallop like

00:07:33.564 --> 00:07:36.940
nobody else, and he loved his
horses.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.350
Been to West Point.
About the only thing he really

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.430
got good grades in at West Point
were painting and drawing.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:50.050
He nearly failed some of the
military science courses.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.367
Some of his biographers have
actually made a big deal out of

00:07:54.367 --> 00:07:58.171
that, that because he hadn't
studied hard in Jomini's

00:07:58.171 --> 00:08:00.900
Manuals,
those manuals of combat tactics

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.468
and strategy,
that he was therefore freer to

00:08:03.468 --> 00:08:09.000
simply invent as he went.
I don't know.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.199
This war made Grant at the same
time he made the war.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:15.208
He may have been,
as many of his--and by the way

00:08:15.208 --> 00:08:18.985
there's been an industry of
Grant biographies in the past 10

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:21.780
to 15 years;
he's been rediscovered after a

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:25.498
long period in our history when
he just vanished and the country

00:08:25.498 --> 00:08:28.174
forgot that "oh,
by the way, the Union won the

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:30.050
war and there was that guy
Grant."

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.622
There are far,
far, far more monuments to

00:08:37.622 --> 00:08:40.892
Robert E.
Lee on the American landscape

00:08:40.892 --> 00:08:46.408
than there are to Ulysses Grant.
I'll try to explain that at the

00:08:46.408 --> 00:08:50.503
end of the course.
His casualty rates in this last

00:08:50.503 --> 00:08:55.898
year of the war were ghastly and
horrible, and it nearly led to a

00:08:55.898 --> 00:09:00.365
sufficient level of war
weariness across the North and

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:05.170
disgust and just an overwhelmed
kind of spirit that it was

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.470
entirely possible by July and
August of '64,

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.831
if certain events hadn't
quickly followed,

00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:17.422
that the North collectively
would've given up the war and

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:21.448
sued for peace.
But Grant developed essentially

00:09:21.448 --> 00:09:25.190
a strategy of victory,
and here's what it was.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.504
He did it in conjunction with
William Tecumseh Sherman,

00:09:29.504 --> 00:09:32.940
Philip Sheridan,
the previous General of the

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.806
Army,
Henry Halleck,

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:38.164
and most importantly with
Lincoln himself,

00:09:38.164 --> 00:09:41.440
and that strategy was basically
this.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.798
It was first to determine that
Richmond, the capital of the

00:09:44.798 --> 00:09:48.098
Confederacy, was not to be the
objective of the war in the

00:09:48.098 --> 00:09:51.790
East;
taking an enemy's capital not

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:55.689
that important.
Secondly, Grant grasped,

00:09:55.689 --> 00:09:59.809
as did Sherman,
the political character of this

00:09:59.809 --> 00:10:04.735
war, that this was now a war to
be won or lost in public

00:10:04.735 --> 00:10:08.264
opinion.
Because it had become all-out,

00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:12.519
because it was now a war upon
people, upon resources,

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:19.557
it depended deeply upon morale
and the will of either side to

00:10:19.557 --> 00:10:23.497
somehow see it through.
Third, Grant,

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:27.605
and Sherman especially,
determined that this would now

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:31.879
be a war on Southern resources.
The destruction of slavery,

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:34.370
of course, becomes a major part
of that.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:38.527
And one of the great ironies of
the war is that Sherman never,

00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:41.389
ever, for a day,
wanted to free a slave.

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:46.364
As he told his officers,
"ain't gonna be no niggers in

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:51.210
Uncle Billy's army."
Sorry, that's what he said.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.509
He wasn't into having black
soldiers;

00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:56.855
in fact there were no black
soldiers who actually served in

00:10:56.855 --> 00:11:00.335
Sherman's army in Georgia.
There will be thousands upon

00:11:00.335 --> 00:11:04.465
thousands of freedman following
his army, and it will force him

00:11:04.465 --> 00:11:08.129
to a situation of a recognition
that will it or not,

00:11:08.129 --> 00:11:12.905
he's crushing the spirit of the
South to destroy slavery,

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:15.890
and ultimately kind of admits
it.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.460
Look for that in Doctorow.

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:25.252
In the East the object of the
war now was to be Lee's army,

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:29.120
to fight Lee's army anywhere,
on ground especially,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.767
that the Northern troops could
somehow choose to try to spring

00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:38.721
Lee out of his trench works,
that he would build everywhere

00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:42.349
they would stop,
and to simply kill as many

00:11:42.349 --> 00:11:47.100
Confederates as possible to
force the South to quit.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.980
It was to be a war on an army,
not for a strategic capital.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.648
Now strategic crossroads and
rivers and so on would be

00:11:56.648 --> 00:12:00.525
important, but the object now
was to destroy the fighting

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:03.639
force of the South and its
fighting will.

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:08.309
And in the Western part of the
war--and there were actually

00:12:08.309 --> 00:12:13.139
five major armies now that Grant
was to try to coordinate;

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:18.264
an army under Nathaniel Banks
out in the far west that Lincoln

00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:23.220
wanted to go into Texas with,
and they never really got into

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.236
Texas.
What Grant wanted

00:12:27.236 --> 00:12:37.327
eventually--excuse me one
second--what Grant wanted was

00:12:37.327 --> 00:12:48.539
the army under Nathaniel Banks
in Louisiana to move east,

00:12:48.539 --> 00:12:51.128
to take Mobile,
the last remaining great

00:12:51.128 --> 00:12:54.977
southern port and then come
smashing right through the Deep

00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:57.500
South across Alabama into
Georgia,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.707
as Sherman's army,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:12:59.707 --> 00:13:02.639
was invading northern Georgia,
toward Atlanta,

00:13:02.639 --> 00:13:07.456
and sort of just invade the
whole middle heartland of the

00:13:07.456 --> 00:13:10.809
South until the South would give
up.

00:13:10.809 --> 00:13:13.940
And in Virginia,
Grant took battlefield command.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.476
He didn't have to,
he could've stayed at his desk

00:13:17.476 --> 00:13:20.718
in Washington,
but it was quite decidedly not

00:13:20.718 --> 00:13:24.186
his style;
he went into the field as the

00:13:24.186 --> 00:13:27.379
Commander of the Army of the
Potomac.

00:13:27.379 --> 00:13:29.951
Now, on the other side,
in Robert E.

00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:34.360
Lee, the South had without a
question--we've said this before

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.622
and there's so much been written
on this you can't count it

00:13:38.622 --> 00:13:42.150
all--the South had a great
general in Lee,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:46.000
a daring general.
In spite of his tremendous

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.148
defeat at Gettysburg,
where he actually did tender

00:13:49.148 --> 00:13:52.489
his resignation that Davis
didn't accept and couldn't

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:55.549
accept,
Lee was already a legend.

00:13:55.549 --> 00:13:58.360
His men saw him as almost
God-like.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.355
He was beautiful,
they said, he was gorgeous,

00:14:02.355 --> 00:14:06.827
he was handsome.
No one ever looked quite like

00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:11.230
Lee in a uniform with that curly
white hair.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.066
There's a brand new biography
out that I recently reviewed by

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:17.254
a woman named Elizabeth Pryor;
it's just won the Abraham

00:14:17.254 --> 00:14:19.904
Lincoln Prize.
There's another lovely irony,

00:14:19.904 --> 00:14:22.060
a book on Lee wins the Lincoln
Prize;

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:23.270
that's reconciliation.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.775
[Laughter]
It's called Reading the

00:14:30.775 --> 00:14:35.000
Man.
Sounds like a title of a porn

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.402
movie or something
but--[Laughter]

00:14:38.402 --> 00:14:41.891
Sorry, scratch that Jude.
[Laughter]

00:14:41.891 --> 00:14:45.019
But she did the book from Lee's
voluminous letters.

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:49.299
He was a tremendous letter
writer, throughout his life.

00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:53.565
Lifetime officer,
son of Light Horse Harry Lee of

00:14:53.565 --> 00:14:57.975
the American Revolution fame.
His father had been a total

00:14:57.975 --> 00:15:00.981
scoundrel.
He had a brother that was an

00:15:00.981 --> 00:15:03.919
even greater scoundrel.
His brother,

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:08.149
and probably his father,
had fathered children by slave

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:11.673
women, had abandoned their
homes, their wives,

00:15:11.673 --> 00:15:15.068
their families.
He came from a very,

00:15:15.068 --> 00:15:18.633
very difficult,
sordid but aristocratic,

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:22.711
famous Virginia family,
and he went to West Point just

00:15:22.711 --> 00:15:25.319
like his daddy,
and he became an officer in his

00:15:25.319 --> 00:15:27.568
early twenties.
He spent his twenties,

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:30.026
his thirties,
and his forties spread all over

00:15:30.026 --> 00:15:32.540
the United States,
largely as an engineer.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.498
He was a great engineer.
He helped build the first

00:15:36.498 --> 00:15:40.525
bridge across the Mississippi.
He helped redirect rivers in

00:15:40.525 --> 00:15:43.789
the lower Mississippi,
and on and on.

00:15:43.789 --> 00:15:47.853
He spent probably two-thirds of
his life, up until the Civil

00:15:47.853 --> 00:15:51.091
War, away from home,
away from that mansion that

00:15:51.091 --> 00:15:53.640
sits today in Arlington
Cemetery.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.245
Arlington House was Lee's home.
He inherited it by marrying

00:15:59.245 --> 00:16:04.019
into it.
He married a Custis;

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:06.218
he married into the family of
George Washington,

00:16:06.218 --> 00:16:08.230
the extended family of George
Washington.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.892
And, of course,
it is Lee's own home,

00:16:10.892 --> 00:16:15.182
Arlington, that before the war
even ended the United States

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:20.584
Government confiscated.
Lee's wife, to say the least,

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:25.973
never got over this.
They confiscated Lee's home and

00:16:25.973 --> 00:16:30.972
converted it into the largest
national cemetery in the

00:16:30.972 --> 00:16:33.656
country.
If you ever go to Arlington,

00:16:33.656 --> 00:16:36.713
go to Arlington House,
or at least remember that that

00:16:36.713 --> 00:16:39.947
was founded to bury the
thousands and thousands of Union

00:16:39.947 --> 00:16:41.770
dead killed by Lee's army.

00:16:45.039 --> 00:16:47.579
At any rate,
he may have hated war in the

00:16:47.579 --> 00:16:51.326
abstract but his biographers
have taken us into Lee's psyche

00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:54.511
in some useful ways.
I won't cite all these many

00:16:54.511 --> 00:16:57.587
biographies but some of them
have really shown us a

00:16:57.587 --> 00:17:01.710
complicated man of great daring
and audacity and aggressiveness.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.150
He always wanted to be on the
offensive.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:09.597
He hated being entrenched.
He hated being on the defensive

00:17:09.597 --> 00:17:15.498
and he clearly saw war as an
emotional or psychological

00:17:15.498 --> 00:17:19.198
release.
"I think a little lead properly

00:17:19.198 --> 00:17:22.020
taken is good for a man," he
said.

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.940
That was in the Mexican War.
He didn't say that during the

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.420
Civil War.
Surveying the field of

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.009
slaughter at Fredericksburg in
December of '62 he said,

00:17:33.009 --> 00:17:38.713
famously, "It is well that war
is so terrible so that we do not

00:17:38.713 --> 00:17:45.299
grow too fond of it."
He appeared to change in battle.

00:17:45.299 --> 00:17:51.009
His eyes would be like fire,
people said.

00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:54.508
An English journalist observer
in the Battle of the Wilderness,

00:17:54.508 --> 00:17:57.668
a horrible battle fought in
dense woods, observed this of

00:17:57.668 --> 00:18:00.160
Lee.
"No man who at the terrible

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:04.920
moment saw his flashing eyes and
sternly set lips is ever likely

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.944
to forget them,
the light of battle still

00:18:07.944 --> 00:18:11.449
flaming in his eyes."
And there are lots of people

00:18:11.449 --> 00:18:15.033
who said that about him.
The debate about Lee is

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:19.940
essentially, among historians at
least, is essentially whether he

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.657
bled the South to death,
so to speak,

00:18:22.657 --> 00:18:25.572
with his aggressiveness,
his two major invasions of the

00:18:25.572 --> 00:18:28.380
North and the cost that meant to
the Confederacy,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.186
or whether he was the true
military genius of American

00:18:32.186 --> 00:18:35.993
history and only through that
offensive daring did the

00:18:35.993 --> 00:18:39.009
Confederacy survive as long as
it did.

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:43.272
Or, only through his devotion
and his maneuverability of huge

00:18:43.272 --> 00:18:47.606
numbers of men across difficult
landscapes did the Confederacy

00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:51.371
survive as long as it did
through 1864 in his struggle

00:18:51.371 --> 00:18:56.964
against Grant's Army,
which outnumbered him at times

00:18:56.964 --> 00:19:03.197
two to one, in 1864 and 1865.
But he hated being on the

00:19:03.197 --> 00:19:07.137
defensive now in 1864.
"I will strike that man a blow

00:19:07.137 --> 00:19:09.464
in the morning,
I will strike that man a blow

00:19:09.464 --> 00:19:13.742
in the morning,"
he would say sometimes at night

00:19:13.742 --> 00:19:19.019
in his camp, even if he wasn't
planning to do it.

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:23.822
Now, the Campaign of 1864,
the pivotal--in so many ways,

00:19:23.822 --> 00:19:28.363
decisive, despite the fact that
it becomes a horrible

00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:33.777
stalemate--the decisive campaign
of the Civil War in everyone's

00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:38.028
hopes in the North,
a campaign once again that

00:19:38.028 --> 00:19:42.324
would only be one summer,
was launched in April and May

00:19:42.324 --> 00:19:46.235
of '64.
But it wasn't going to end that

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:49.169
summer.
It would end in a horrible

00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:53.020
stalemate and a siege of the
city of Petersburg,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.925
just south of Richmond.
And the war,

00:19:55.925 --> 00:19:59.220
of course, would not end until
the following spring,

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.719
four Aprils into the war.
But here's roughly what

00:20:02.719 --> 00:20:07.275
happened--and by the way I refer
you here to the Ken Burns film

00:20:07.275 --> 00:20:09.905
series,
and there's of course a very

00:20:09.905 --> 00:20:14.103
good reason that Burns decided
in this nine-part film series to

00:20:14.103 --> 00:20:16.880
give two whole parts to the year
1864.

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.475
I have my own little criticisms
of that film series which I'll

00:20:20.475 --> 00:20:23.009
be happy to share with you at
some point,

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:26.349
but I thought it was actually
quite brilliant the way he just

00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:28.519
makes you agonize to get out of
1864;

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:32.779
I mean, God how long must 1864
last?

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:37.549
Because that's actually the way
the country felt.

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:42.079
In the Battle of the
Wilderness, May 5-6,1864,

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:46.609
the two armies basically
collided just west of

00:20:46.609 --> 00:20:52.464
Fredericksburg in a densely,
densely wooded area that was

00:20:52.464 --> 00:20:56.039
known at that time as the
Wilderness.

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:58.927
They essentially just bumped
into one another because there

00:20:58.927 --> 00:21:01.764
were only two roads that went
North, South or East or West

00:21:01.764 --> 00:21:05.897
through this area.
And they fought it out in woods

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:09.715
for two days.
It was a totally disorganized

00:21:09.715 --> 00:21:11.836
battle.
Often men would only fire at

00:21:11.836 --> 00:21:14.573
what they saw other weapons
firing, because they could

00:21:14.573 --> 00:21:19.957
really never see their enemies,
and hence sometimes killed

00:21:19.957 --> 00:21:23.080
their own men.
And the most horrible thing

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.026
about the Wilderness,
of course, as you perhaps have

00:21:25.026 --> 00:21:26.349
heard,
is that hundreds,

00:21:26.349 --> 00:21:28.769
if not thousands,
of wounded ended up being

00:21:28.769 --> 00:21:32.227
burned to death in the woods
because the woods caught on fire

00:21:32.227 --> 00:21:35.799
in several places and the
wounded could not be retrieved.

00:21:35.799 --> 00:21:40.369
Soldiers on both sides laid
down at night in makeshift

00:21:40.369 --> 00:21:45.284
trench works along roadways and
listened to their comrades

00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:50.630
scream as they were burning to
death in the woods and could not

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:53.998
save them.
In two days of a really

00:21:53.998 --> 00:21:59.098
thoroughly disorganized slugfest
in woods, Grant's Army lost

00:21:59.098 --> 00:22:02.470
18,400 casualties,
dead and wounded.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.619
Lee lost about 11,000,
dead and wounded.

00:22:07.619 --> 00:22:11.934
And it appeared that Lee had
once again--for what,

00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:16.865
the fourth time now?-- stopped
a Union Army invading into

00:22:16.865 --> 00:22:19.552
Virginia,
and that that Union Army would

00:22:19.552 --> 00:22:22.380
probably have to retreat back
out of this densely wooded

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.787
wilderness,
get up north of the

00:22:24.787 --> 00:22:27.185
Rappahannock,
regroup again,

00:22:27.185 --> 00:22:30.649
again, again,
as the Army of the Potomac

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:33.538
always had.
And yet what happened was,

00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:37.210
of course, Grant never intended
to stop no matter what happened.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.369
He had the obvious advantage of
manpower.

00:22:39.369 --> 00:22:44.039
He had tremendous resources
behind him.

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:47.382
Although that manpower was
risky, because that very summer

00:22:47.382 --> 00:22:50.784
the three-year enlist--they
weren't up by May but they were

00:22:50.784 --> 00:22:54.009
going to be up in June--the
three-year enlistments,

00:22:54.009 --> 00:22:56.852
from '61 to '64,
the great mass of the Army of

00:22:56.852 --> 00:23:00.009
the Potomac had been in--those
who had survived,

00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:02.585
the veterans,
the real soldiers--had been in

00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:05.339
for three years and their terms
would be up.

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:12.160
How in the hell to get these
men to re-enlist when they were

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.136
enduring this?
And the government came up with

00:23:15.136 --> 00:23:17.172
three and four-hundred dollar
bounties, they came up with

00:23:17.172 --> 00:23:18.589
thirty day furloughs here and
there,

00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:20.859
percentages of regiments sent
home.

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.849
They'd do anything to get these
guys to re-enlist.

00:23:22.849 --> 00:23:27.082
And Lincoln called for 500,000
more volunteers,

00:23:27.082 --> 00:23:30.459
a half a million.
Now they will actually

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:35.049
eventually get almost that half
million men, but the problem,

00:23:35.049 --> 00:23:37.448
as the Union armies realized
that summer, is that these new

00:23:37.448 --> 00:23:39.846
soldiers, brought in by being
paid bounties and all sort of

00:23:39.846 --> 00:23:43.069
other things,
were terrible soldiers.

00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:47.552
And Grant counted by July and
August of these new recruits

00:23:47.552 --> 00:23:52.349
that about three of every four
became deserters the first time

00:23:52.349 --> 00:23:55.278
they faced combat.
So that manpower was not a

00:23:55.278 --> 00:23:57.260
certain thing,
but Grant just kept moving.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.881
And there's a famous story.
It's the night of the second

00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:06.655
day, it's the 6^(th) of May '64,
and most of the Union Army is

00:24:06.655 --> 00:24:10.490
camped along a roadway,
a North/South roadway.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.388
They've just fought the two
worst days of the war,

00:24:13.388 --> 00:24:16.000
if they've survived.
They're depleted.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.559
Woods are burning.
They expect any moment to all

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.868
have to retreat north.
And there came Grant with just

00:24:23.868 --> 00:24:26.899
a few members of his staff
cantering down the road,

00:24:26.899 --> 00:24:29.808
heading south.
He didn't stop to say anything

00:24:29.808 --> 00:24:32.340
to anybody.
He didn't even tip his hat;

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:37.555
probably spit from his cigar.
And as they saw him moving

00:24:37.555 --> 00:24:41.680
South, they began to realize
they weren't retreating.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.228
And for about a mile and a half
along this roadway these scarred

00:24:46.228 --> 00:24:49.910
soldiers started to get up and
scream and holler,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:55.070
at the top of their lungs,
for Grant, for Grant;

00:24:55.070 --> 00:25:01.009
they were going South.
And they did.

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:06.159
The rest of this terrible
campaign would be an attempt by

00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:10.769
Grant now to outmaneuver Lee,
to try to keep moving left,

00:25:10.769 --> 00:25:13.309
Grant's left,
to try to get around Lee's

00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:16.359
army, to move faster than Lee,
if possible,

00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:21.009
and ultimately to cut off Lee's
supply line, either to Richmond

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:25.782
or further south from Richmond,
and if possible--forget about

00:25:25.782 --> 00:25:30.533
taking Richmond--but to try to
cut off Lee's army from the rest

00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:34.169
of the South,
and if possible with Sheridan's

00:25:34.169 --> 00:25:38.599
army in the Shenandoah Valley
cut him off from the West.

00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:42.682
So when Grant gets accused of
being a butcher that summer,

00:25:42.682 --> 00:25:44.760
there's some truth to that.

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:50.203
But it really was a war of
maneuver, maneuver,

00:25:50.203 --> 00:25:52.513
maneuver.
They collided--actually the

00:25:52.513 --> 00:25:55.863
first attempt was to see who
could get first to this

00:25:55.863 --> 00:25:58.819
crossroads called Spotsylvania
Courthouse,

00:25:58.819 --> 00:26:03.313
and at Spotsylvania they fought
for about six,

00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:07.851
seven consecutive days.
This was the rehearsal for

00:26:07.851 --> 00:26:11.099
World War One.
Everywhere the army stopped

00:26:11.099 --> 00:26:15.009
they dug the deepest possible
trenches they could.

00:26:15.009 --> 00:26:17.886
And at Spotsylvania,
indeed, Lee's army got there

00:26:17.886 --> 00:26:21.122
just before Grant's army and
they built this incredible

00:26:21.122 --> 00:26:23.400
trench work that was in a
U-shape,

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.789
and for about six days Grant's
army just made one frontal

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:33.003
assault on this after another,
and it produced these

00:26:33.003 --> 00:26:36.028
horrifying scenes of the dead
and wounded, three and four

00:26:36.028 --> 00:26:38.394
deep,
in these trenches,

00:26:38.394 --> 00:26:43.125
day after day after day,
most of it fought in

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:46.001
rainstorms.
At Spotsylvania,

00:26:46.001 --> 00:26:51.057
when you add it all up--they
first encountered each other on

00:26:51.057 --> 00:26:55.599
the 8^(th) of May and they
didn't really stop fighting

00:26:55.599 --> 00:27:00.827
there until about the 19^(th) of
May--Grant's army lost almost

00:27:00.827 --> 00:27:06.309
30,000 casualties;
Lee's army almost 20,000

00:27:06.309 --> 00:27:12.164
casualties.
And yet Grant just kept moving

00:27:12.164 --> 00:27:16.489
and kept moving,
left and south,

00:27:16.489 --> 00:27:19.895
left and south.
And then Grant,

00:27:19.895 --> 00:27:23.119
the first week of June,
would make his greatest mistake

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:27.061
of the war, and he admitted it.
It's the only place in his

00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:30.883
great two-volume memoir when he
used the word regret,

00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:33.750
and he really regretted Cold
Harbor.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:40.000
At Cold Harbor,
Grant had misinformation.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.533
He somehow did not understand
how much of Lee's army had

00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:47.323
actually concentrated in front
of him and somehow he mis-saw

00:27:47.323 --> 00:27:50.866
the landscape.
He didn't realize that Lee's

00:27:50.866 --> 00:27:55.895
army on each flank had a river,
and those rivers were pretty

00:27:55.895 --> 00:28:00.242
high, it was May/June,
and there was no way to flank

00:28:00.242 --> 00:28:02.243
him.
So he just made,

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:06.021
on the 3^(rd) of June,
the largest frontal assault

00:28:06.021 --> 00:28:10.957
attack of the war.
There were 50,000 Union troops

00:28:10.957 --> 00:28:15.602
engaged in this,
and Grant's army took 7000

00:28:15.602 --> 00:28:21.311
casualties in a half-hour.
And many of the men--and they'd

00:28:21.311 --> 00:28:26.152
been fighting now day after day
after day, and God only knows

00:28:26.152 --> 00:28:30.589
what fatalists soldiers become
in that circumstance.

00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:33.934
They were asked before the
attack at Cold Harbor to pin

00:28:33.934 --> 00:28:36.782
their names and home addresses
on their shirts,

00:28:36.782 --> 00:28:39.260
at least much of the Union Army
was.

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:42.710
And they did.
They had no dog tags in that

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:44.870
war.
They were told to pin their

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:48.630
names on themselves so they
could be identified when dead.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:54.009
And I believe Burns uses this
story in the film.

00:28:54.009 --> 00:28:57.393
There was one Union soldier who
etched into his diary,

00:28:57.393 --> 00:29:00.840
"Morning, June 3^(rd),
I died today at Cold Harbor."

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:09.550
And he did.
This stopped Grant's movement.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:16.792
It protected Richmond.
It meant that the war would now

00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:19.800
go on and on through that
summer.

00:29:23.009 --> 00:29:25.189
Rather than attempting any more
assaults on Lee's forces,

00:29:25.189 --> 00:29:26.940
which were now constantly
digging trenches,

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.141
digging trenches,
digging trenches,

00:29:29.141 --> 00:29:31.860
all around the eastern side of
Richmond,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.741
Grant kept moving south.
And this time he got to

00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:41.259
Petersburg faster than Lee,
or at least most of Lee's army,

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:46.156
and by mid to late June they
put the city of Petersburg,

00:29:46.156 --> 00:29:50.430
just some twenty-five miles
south of Richmond,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.490
under siege.
And Petersburg would--and you

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.543
can see many of these great
photographs in Burns' film

00:29:57.543 --> 00:30:00.542
series.
Photographers went crazy in '64

00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:04.136
and '65 photographing these
giant trench works,

00:30:04.136 --> 00:30:08.589
these trench cities that were
built around Petersburg.

00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:13.023
There would be a quick attempt
to break the siege at Petersburg

00:30:13.023 --> 00:30:17.100
in what is known as the Battle
of the Crater--quick in the

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.721
sense of about a month after.
Grant's army concentrated all

00:30:21.721 --> 00:30:26.009
around the east side and the
south side of Petersburg.

00:30:26.009 --> 00:30:29.391
They were always trying to cut
Lee's supply lines off,

00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:32.708
either west or south,
and never managed to completely

00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:37.011
do it until the next spring.
But you may know the story of

00:30:37.011 --> 00:30:42.016
the Battle of the Crater.
Some coalminers in the 48^(th)

00:30:42.016 --> 00:30:46.978
Pennsylvania went to their
Colonel, who went to his

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:50.250
General,
who went to General Burnside,

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.009
who went to Grant and said,
"We can dig a tunnel,

00:30:54.009 --> 00:30:56.365
500 yards, under the
Confederate line,

00:30:56.365 --> 00:30:59.039
and we'll fill it with tons of
dynamite,

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:00.477
and we can do it with
ventilation slats,

00:31:00.477 --> 00:31:02.725
we know how to do these things,
and we'll blow the Confederate

00:31:02.725 --> 00:31:07.029
line to smithereens.
Let us do it."

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:08.267
And at first Grant and his
staff said, "No,

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:11.181
no, no, no, this is too crazy."
They sat down with him,

00:31:11.181 --> 00:31:15.740
they convinced him they could
do it, and they did it.

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.349
Five hundred yards of a tunnel,
they ventilated it,

00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:22.019
the Confederates on the other
side.

00:31:22.019 --> 00:31:25.475
And the lines in some areas
here were never more than 150 to

00:31:25.475 --> 00:31:28.239
200 yards apart.
They actually did hear some

00:31:28.239 --> 00:31:31.720
digging, we're told later,
but they didn't know what the

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.025
hell it was.
And then they dug a

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:37.450
counter-trench at the end,
inside, or a tunnel.

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:45.019
They put in four tons of
dynamite, fuses.

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:47.339
You to this day can see the
openings of that tunnel and you

00:31:47.339 --> 00:31:49.819
can still see the suppression in
the landscape where the crater

00:31:49.819 --> 00:31:53.267
was.
And on July 30,1864 they blew

00:31:53.267 --> 00:31:59.738
it up, and they blew up an area
of the Confederate line about

00:31:59.738 --> 00:32:03.891
200 yards long.
Men's bodies were simply

00:32:03.891 --> 00:32:07.739
exploded into the air.
It's the opening scene of

00:32:07.739 --> 00:32:11.059
Cold Mountain,
if you've seen the movie.

00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:13.410
Not bad, it's one of the best
parts of that movie actually.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.130
I thought Nicole Kidman was
badly cast;

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.716
I don't know about you.
[Laughter]

00:32:17.716 --> 00:32:21.061
When you're suffering and you
haven't got enough to eat and

00:32:21.061 --> 00:32:24.464
you're laying in the snow you
can't look like Nicole Kidman,

00:32:24.464 --> 00:32:29.259
I'm sorry.
[Laughter] It ain't right.

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:32.487
But the problem was the Battle
of the Crater became a Union

00:32:32.487 --> 00:32:34.917
disaster.
Instead of exploiting this as

00:32:34.917 --> 00:32:36.797
they should have,
and been far,

00:32:36.797 --> 00:32:40.243
far more organized--they
should've managed to get around

00:32:40.243 --> 00:32:43.752
this crater--actually they
didn't even understand how big

00:32:43.752 --> 00:32:47.512
this gigantic hole in the ground
would be--a huge hole in the

00:32:47.512 --> 00:32:50.270
Confederate line had been
exploded,

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.883
hundreds of yards wide.
But Union troops started

00:32:53.883 --> 00:32:58.850
marching into the hole--I'm not
kidding--and within an hour or

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.553
two,
as Confederates regrouped,

00:33:01.553 --> 00:33:04.918
in sheer shock,
they said it was just like

00:33:04.918 --> 00:33:09.871
picking out fish in a bowl,
and they stood all around this

00:33:09.871 --> 00:33:14.724
giant hole in the ground.
And 4,000 Union troops were

00:33:14.724 --> 00:33:20.613
killed in the Battle of the
Crater, which turned out to be a

00:33:20.613 --> 00:33:25.740
Union disaster.
Now, out West.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:51.010
Where's Sherman? There he is.
Can we see this?

00:34:00.529 --> 00:34:05.383
Now, the other major campaign
of the war that of course will

00:34:05.383 --> 00:34:09.578
ultimately lead to Union
victory--and I won't get us

00:34:09.578 --> 00:34:15.090
quite to the dead-end of the war
today by any means--but it is,

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.203
of course, William Sherman's
Atlanta Campaign through

00:34:19.203 --> 00:34:22.288
northern Georgia,
the fall of Atlanta by

00:34:22.288 --> 00:34:25.964
September of '64.
The campaign lasted all that

00:34:25.964 --> 00:34:29.573
summer.
At the same time this stalemate

00:34:29.573 --> 00:34:33.291
sets in in Virginia,
around Petersburg,

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:37.010
with these thousands of
casualties.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:40.506
And you must try to,
if you can imagine Northerners

00:34:40.506 --> 00:34:44.561
standing in post offices and
telegraph offices all over the

00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:47.444
towns of the Midwest,
New England,

00:34:47.444 --> 00:34:53.024
waiting for casualty reports,
and the adjutants of regiments

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:56.574
writing the lists.
Standing in a small town post

00:34:56.574 --> 00:34:59.920
office and a telegraph comes
through with a list of the dead;

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.905
a dozen, two dozen,
three dozen,

00:35:02.905 --> 00:35:07.239
men, from a town that only had
1000 people.

00:35:07.239 --> 00:35:13.039
It was beginning to destroy
Northern morale.

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:15.334
And things weren't that much
better in Georgia,

00:35:15.334 --> 00:35:17.429
or so it seemed,
throughout that summer.

00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:23.448
Sherman finally outmaneuvered
General Joseph Johnston's

00:35:23.448 --> 00:35:27.349
Confederate Army,
toward Atlanta,

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:31.878
won at Kennesaw Mountain in two
days in June,

00:35:31.878 --> 00:35:36.407
late June of '64,
and essentially put Atlanta

00:35:36.407 --> 00:35:41.998
under siege in July and August,
and kept trying to get around,

00:35:41.998 --> 00:35:45.579
around, around--especially to
the left, to the east and

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:49.358
south--Atlanta to cut off the
supply lines to this biggest

00:35:49.358 --> 00:35:52.010
city in the heartland of the
South.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:56.457
He finally succeeded,
at great cost,

00:35:56.457 --> 00:36:03.320
when Atlanta fell on the 4^(th)
of September in '64.

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:08.700
And the fall of Atlanta is in
some ways, both strategically

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:12.875
and in terms of morale,
one of the most important

00:36:12.875 --> 00:36:17.180
little turning points of the
war, that has a huge impact on

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.263
the political situation and the
Election of '64 about to

00:36:21.263 --> 00:36:25.568
occur--more on that in a second.
It was then that Sherman,

00:36:25.568 --> 00:36:28.622
based on this strategy of
conquest, destruction of

00:36:28.622 --> 00:36:32.547
resources and war upon people,
made the decision,

00:36:32.547 --> 00:36:38.150
really quite quickly,
to launch his march to the sea.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:43.581
It took him a couple of months
to organize it but from November

00:36:43.581 --> 00:36:49.188
15^(th) to Christmas Eve--that's
about five weeks--Sherman's army

00:36:49.188 --> 00:36:54.970
marched 285 miles from Atlanta
to Savannah with 62,000 troops.

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:59.388
They were almost unopposed.
General John B.

00:36:59.388 --> 00:37:04.187
Hood's Confederate Army,
that had surrendered--in effect

00:37:04.187 --> 00:37:08.200
given up--Atlanta,
had retreated south to fight

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.224
again.
And Hood's idea,

00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:13.883
but actually without Jefferson
Davis's approval--well if

00:37:13.883 --> 00:37:17.010
Sherman was going to invade
toward the East,

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.669
toward the sea and destroy
Georgia, Hood took an army of

00:37:19.669 --> 00:37:22.280
about 30,000 men and invaded
back up into Tennessee,

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:26.300
hoping that Sherman would stop
and come after him.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.810
Sherman said, "Let him go."

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:37.072
It was a kind of a game now,
of time, resources,

00:37:37.072 --> 00:37:41.010
destruction,
and who would give up.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.051
"We are not fighting a hostile
army anymore," Sherman said,

00:37:44.051 --> 00:37:46.253
I'm quoting him,
"we are fighting a hostile

00:37:46.253 --> 00:37:49.408
people.
His aim and objective now was

00:37:49.408 --> 00:37:54.031
the civilian population,
and Americans had never made

00:37:54.031 --> 00:37:59.010
war on civilians quite like
Sherman would in Georgia.

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.925
"We cannot change the hearts of
those people," Sherman wrote of

00:38:02.925 --> 00:38:06.651
the South, "but we can make war
so terrible and make them so

00:38:06.651 --> 00:38:10.377
sick of war that generations
will pass before they will ever

00:38:10.377 --> 00:38:12.020
again appeal to it."

00:38:15.039 --> 00:38:19.083
Now up in the Shenandoah
Valley, Philip Sheridan's Union

00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:22.759
Army, under similar orders,
to make war on society,

00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:25.699
gave a simple order to his
officers;

00:38:25.699 --> 00:38:28.730
and most of that army was
cavalry.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.679
His order was put in the
starkest of total war terms.

00:38:33.679 --> 00:38:37.243
He said, quote,
"Leave them only their eyes

00:38:37.243 --> 00:38:43.030
with which to weep."
This was now savage war.

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:46.653
To win the war with fear was
Sherman's goal,

00:38:46.653 --> 00:38:51.539
to win it with destruction and
to win it with maneuvers.

00:38:51.539 --> 00:38:58.010
Freed slaves swarmed behind
Sherman's army.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:59.235
He hated it,
he didn't want them to be

00:38:59.235 --> 00:39:01.256
there, he didn't know what to do
with them--what the hell am I

00:39:01.256 --> 00:39:02.846
going to do with this people?
First it was 5,000;

00:39:02.846 --> 00:39:05.545
10,000; 15.
He had 25 to 30,000 refugee

00:39:05.545 --> 00:39:08.550
slaves tailing right behind his
army;

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:11.260
it was about half the size of
his whole army.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:15.818
Follow that in Doctorow.
Sherman didn't always play

00:39:15.818 --> 00:39:20.355
kindness or niceness with them.
At one point his troops lifted

00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:24.039
up the pontoon bridge across a
river and scores of freedmen

00:39:24.039 --> 00:39:27.469
trying to get across with him
drowned in the river.

00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:32.430
Sherman's attitude was "the way
it goes."

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:38.690
They made it by Christmas Eve
to Savannah;

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:41.909
just before that into Liberty
County, just south of Savannah.

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:44.277
And to this day in Liberty
County, Georgia,

00:39:44.277 --> 00:39:47.491
there are plenty of people
around--I have a former student

00:39:47.491 --> 00:39:50.536
who lives there and runs a
historic site--who will tell

00:39:50.536 --> 00:39:53.460
you,
"This is where Sherman turned

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:58.010
left."
Okay.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:00.055
And you think,
well okay, there must've been a

00:40:00.055 --> 00:40:02.600
left turn sign or something,
this is where Sherman turned

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.947
left.
I'll also never forget the time

00:40:04.947 --> 00:40:08.260
I was doing research in the
Caroliniana Collections in

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.663
Columbia,
South Carolina,

00:40:09.663 --> 00:40:11.886
and I don't remember exactly
what I asked for in the

00:40:11.886 --> 00:40:14.369
Archives--I spent a good week
there--I don't remember.

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:18.510
Oh, it was records about the
state capital and the buildings.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:20.635
I wanted to know about the
ruins and destruction,

00:40:20.635 --> 00:40:22.603
and I asked for this stuff,
and the archivist,

00:40:22.603 --> 00:40:24.312
who was a woman,
looked up from the desk at me

00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:26.190
and she said,
"Don't have it.

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.044
Sherman burnt it."
[Laughter]

00:40:28.044 --> 00:40:33.481
Okay, thank you very much,
I won't be able to look at that

00:40:33.481 --> 00:40:38.370
stuff apparently.
Now, if you follow the purple

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:43.406
line here, of course,
you realize that this is the

00:40:43.406 --> 00:40:46.127
destined,
this is the route of

00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:50.590
Sherman's--this is about 280
miles from Atlanta to the sea.

00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:55.408
It would give us some of the
best songs of the war,

00:40:55.408 --> 00:41:00.260
marching through Georgia.
It also gave the Civil War its

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:04.159
anti-hero, its principal
villain, of Union victory,

00:41:04.159 --> 00:41:09.696
some say the architect of total
war--that's a little too much to

00:41:09.696 --> 00:41:13.921
lay on Sherman.
But it was now a war of

00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:19.642
conquest and destruction.
He did not destroy Savannah but

00:41:19.642 --> 00:41:24.821
when he got to Charleston--well
actually much of Charleston he

00:41:24.821 --> 00:41:29.915
didn't have to destroy because
it was being destroyed already

00:41:29.915 --> 00:41:35.010
by Union gunboats and artillery
from around the harbor.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:40.055
But the city he did destroy was
Columbia, the capital of South

00:41:40.055 --> 00:41:43.694
Carolina, which was burned to
the ground, as,

00:41:43.694 --> 00:41:47.107
by the way, was Atlanta.
Now, Sherman would always say

00:41:47.107 --> 00:41:49.225
these were just fires that broke
out because of extensive

00:41:49.225 --> 00:41:52.771
shelling.
That was not the case in

00:41:52.771 --> 00:41:55.852
Columbia.
They burned about everything

00:41:55.852 --> 00:41:59.373
that was standing in Columbia,
and then they kept moving

00:41:59.373 --> 00:42:01.741
north;
north, north into North

00:42:01.741 --> 00:42:04.370
Carolina.
And I'll come back to that

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:08.071
later because the final,
final surrender of the Civil

00:42:08.071 --> 00:42:10.775
War, of course,
came in North Carolina,

00:42:10.775 --> 00:42:12.270
not in Virginia.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:25.931
Now, before we get to
Appomattox--I'm going to save

00:42:25.931 --> 00:42:31.676
the Siege of Petersburg,
the lifting of the siege and

00:42:31.676 --> 00:42:37.010
the march to Appomattox and the
surrender for Thursday,

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:40.705
because it makes a perfect
segway back into wartime

00:42:40.705 --> 00:42:44.179
reconstruction plans,
because the nature of that

00:42:44.179 --> 00:42:48.539
surrender at Appomattox has a
great deal to do with the kind

00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:52.900
of reconstruction ideas and
plans that were boiling as early

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.127
as 1863 really,
out of Congress and from

00:42:56.127 --> 00:42:59.543
Lincoln himself.
And let me just end with this

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:02.777
little story.
I mentioned that Sherman made

00:43:02.777 --> 00:43:06.774
it to the sea at Savannah,
marched part of his troops up

00:43:06.774 --> 00:43:09.495
to Charleston,
took Charleston,

00:43:09.495 --> 00:43:14.882
the seedbed of Secession and
all of that, although actually

00:43:14.882 --> 00:43:20.454
Charleston didn't fully fall to
Union hands until February of

00:43:20.454 --> 00:43:22.773
'65.
It had been bombarded

00:43:22.773 --> 00:43:26.376
throughout the last eight to
nine months, as I said,

00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:29.980
from Union ships and guns all
around the harbor.

00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:34.039
And if you've ever been to
Charleston, that glorious,

00:43:34.039 --> 00:43:37.119
beautiful colonial city,
that Caribbean city,

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:39.272
as it looks,
with all those mansions about

00:43:39.272 --> 00:43:41.739
fifteen to twenty blocks up from
the harbor,

00:43:41.739 --> 00:43:48.161
you must imagine it almost
completely in ruin by early

00:43:48.161 --> 00:43:51.280
1865.
All the white people evacuated

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.836
and abandoned the city,
and the only people left

00:43:54.836 --> 00:43:58.998
principally were slaves,
freedmen, thousands of them,

00:43:58.998 --> 00:44:01.949
and they in effect took over
the city.

00:44:01.949 --> 00:44:07.029
The first Union regiment that
marched up Meeting Street in

00:44:07.029 --> 00:44:11.062
Charleston was the 21^(st) USCT,
a colored infantry,

00:44:11.062 --> 00:44:13.596
a black regiment,
and they accepted the surrender

00:44:13.596 --> 00:44:17.150
of the city from its mayor.
And then they began to hold

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.528
ceremonies, the black folks of
Charleston, they began to hold

00:44:21.528 --> 00:44:27.260
ceremonies all around the city.
They held a parade in late

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:32.010
March--or was it early April--of
'65.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.018
They had this huge parade where
they had two floats and they

00:44:34.018 --> 00:44:36.533
had, on one float,
they had a little slave auction

00:44:36.533 --> 00:44:40.260
occurring, a mock slave auction
with a woman with her baby being

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:43.133
sold away,
and on the next float they had

00:44:43.133 --> 00:44:47.269
a coffin labeled "Slavery," and
it said "Fort Sumter Dug its

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:51.880
Grave,
April 12^(th), 1861."

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.443
And then they planned one more
ceremony, and--oh and by the

00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:57.409
way, the war,
when it finally,

00:44:57.409 --> 00:45:01.931
finally, finally ended,
they held an extraordinary

00:45:01.931 --> 00:45:06.441
ceremony on Fort Sumter.
They crammed about 3000 people

00:45:06.441 --> 00:45:11.769
onto the little island.
All kinds of dignitaries came.

00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:16.082
Now General Anderson--not the
Colonel who had surrendered the

00:45:16.082 --> 00:45:19.460
fort four years ago--came and
raised the U.S.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:24.400
flag, four years almost to the
day that they had taken it down.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.140
William Lloyd Garrison was
there from the North,

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.995
the great abolitionist who wept
uncontrollably when he heard a

00:45:32.995 --> 00:45:38.010
small black children's choir
sing John Brown's Body.

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:41.362
And the very night of that
ceremony, which was the 14^(th)

00:45:41.362 --> 00:45:44.033
of April,
they held a banquet of a sort

00:45:44.033 --> 00:45:48.010
in a building that had a roof on
it, back in Charleston,

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:51.266
and that was the very night,
of course, that Lincoln was

00:45:51.266 --> 00:45:54.050
assassinated at Ford's Theater
in Washington.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:57.437
But the black folks of
Charleston had planned one more

00:45:57.437 --> 00:46:02.408
ceremony.
That ceremony was a burial

00:46:02.408 --> 00:46:05.756
ceremony.
It turns out that during the

00:46:05.756 --> 00:46:08.986
last months of the war the
Confederate Army turned the

00:46:08.986 --> 00:46:12.592
planter's horse track,
a racecourse--it was called the

00:46:12.592 --> 00:46:16.690
Washington Racecourse--into an
open air cemetery--excuse me,

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:21.964
prison.
And in that open air prison,

00:46:21.964 --> 00:46:25.549
in the infield of the horse
track--about 260-odd Union

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:29.744
soldiers had died of disease and
exposure--and they were buried

00:46:29.744 --> 00:46:33.262
in unmarked graves in a mass
gravesite out behind the

00:46:33.262 --> 00:46:36.799
grandstand of the racetrack.
And by the way,

00:46:36.799 --> 00:46:41.400
there was no more important and
symbolic site in low country

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.300
planter/slaveholding life then
their racetrack.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.446
Well, the black folks at
Charleston got organized,

00:46:47.446 --> 00:46:49.699
they knew about all this.
They went to the site.

00:46:49.699 --> 00:46:51.789
They re-interred all the
graves, the men.

00:46:51.789 --> 00:46:58.101
They couldn't mark them with
names, they didn't have any

00:46:58.101 --> 00:47:01.039
names.
Then they made them proper

00:47:01.039 --> 00:47:05.077
graves and they built a fence
all the way around this

00:47:05.077 --> 00:47:07.825
cemetery,
about 100 yards long and fity,

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.669
sixty yards deep,
and they whitewashed the fence

00:47:10.669 --> 00:47:14.481
and over an archway they painted
the inscription "Martyrs of the

00:47:14.481 --> 00:47:19.296
Racecourse."
And then on May 1^(st) 1865

00:47:19.296 --> 00:47:27.010
they held a parade of 10,000
people, on the racetrack,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.680
led by 3000 black children
carrying armloads of roses and

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.349
singing John Brown's
Body,

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:35.439
followed then by black women,
then by black men--it was

00:47:35.439 --> 00:47:40.059
regimented this way--then by
contingents of Union infantry.

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:42.110
Everybody marched all the way
around the racetrack;

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:45.199
as many as could fit got into
the gravesite.

00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:49.369
Five black preachers read from
scripture.

00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:51.818
A children's choir sang the
national anthem,

00:47:51.818 --> 00:47:54.949
America the Beautiful,
and several spirituals,

00:47:54.949 --> 00:47:59.683
and then they broke from that
and went back into the infield

00:47:59.683 --> 00:48:04.176
of the racetrack and did
essentially what you and I do on

00:48:04.176 --> 00:48:06.684
Memorial Day,
they ran races,

00:48:06.684 --> 00:48:10.271
they listened to sixteen
speeches, by one count,

00:48:10.271 --> 00:48:15.080
and the troops marched back and
forth and they held picnics.

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:20.704
This was the first Memorial Day.
African-Americans invented

00:48:20.704 --> 00:48:23.533
Memorial Day,
in Charleston,

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:26.883
South Carolina.
There are three or four cities

00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:28.687
in the United States,
North and South,

00:48:28.687 --> 00:48:31.175
that claim to be the site of
the first Memorial Day,

00:48:31.175 --> 00:48:36.070
but they all claim 1866;
they were too late.

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:39.545
I had the great,
blind, good fortune to discover

00:48:39.545 --> 00:48:43.464
this story in a messy,
totally disorganized collection

00:48:43.464 --> 00:48:47.752
of veterans' papers at the
Houghton Library at Harvard some

00:48:47.752 --> 00:48:51.154
years back.
And what you have there is

00:48:51.154 --> 00:48:54.783
black Americans,
recently freed from slavery,

00:48:54.783 --> 00:49:00.199
announcing to the world,
with their flowers and their

00:49:00.199 --> 00:49:06.010
feet and their songs,
what the war had been about.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:11.129
What they basically were
creating was the Independence

00:49:11.129 --> 00:49:14.800
Day of a second American
Revolution.

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:20.901
That story got lost,
it got lost for more than a

00:49:20.901 --> 00:49:23.653
century.
And when I discovered it,

00:49:23.653 --> 00:49:26.677
I started calling people in
Charleston that I knew in

00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:29.439
archives and libraries,
including the Avery Institute,

00:49:29.439 --> 00:49:31.730
the black research center in
Charleston--"Has anybody,

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.410
have you ever heard of this
story?"

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:40.598
And no one had ever heard it.
It showed the power of the Lost

00:49:40.598 --> 00:49:46.039
Cause in the wake of the war to
erase a story.

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:49.680
But I started looking for other
sources, and lo and behold there

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.539
were lots of sources.
Harper's Weekly even had

00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:57.130
a drawing of the cemetery in an
1867 issue.

00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:01.780
The old oval of that racetrack
is still there today.

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.230
If you ever go to Charleston go
up to Hampton Park.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:10.070
Hampton Park is today what the
racecourse was then.

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:12.232
It's named for Wade Hampton,
the white supremacist,

00:50:12.232 --> 00:50:14.525
redeemer, and governor of South
Carolina at the end of

00:50:14.525 --> 00:50:17.380
Reconstruction and a Confederate
General during the Civil War.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.907
And that park sits immediately
adjacent to the Citadel,

00:50:21.907 --> 00:50:25.010
the Military Academy of
Charleston.

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:29.207
On any given day you can see at
any given time about 100 or 200

00:50:29.207 --> 00:50:33.269
Citadel cadets jogging on the
track of the old racecourse.

00:50:33.269 --> 00:50:37.527
There is no marker,
there's no memento,

00:50:37.527 --> 00:50:42.010
there's only a little bit of a
memory.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:44.451
Although a few years ago a
friend of mine in Charleston

00:50:44.451 --> 00:50:47.119
organized a mock ceremony where
we re-enacted that event,

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:51.463
including the children's choir,
and they made me dress up in a

00:50:51.463 --> 00:50:55.378
top hat and a funny old
nineteenth century suit and made

00:50:55.378 --> 00:50:59.010
me get up on a podium and make a
stupid speech.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:03.598
But there is an effort,
at least today,

00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:10.240
to declare Hampton Park a
National Historic Landmark.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.440
See you Thursday.

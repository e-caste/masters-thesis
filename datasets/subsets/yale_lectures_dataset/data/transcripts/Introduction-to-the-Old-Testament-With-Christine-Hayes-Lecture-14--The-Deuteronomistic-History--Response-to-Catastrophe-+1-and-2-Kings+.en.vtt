00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.431
Professor Christine
Hayes: We were talking last

00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:06.387
time about the establishment of
the monarchy or kingship in

00:00:06.387 --> 00:00:09.139
Israel and I want to say a
little bit about some of the

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.197
features of Israelite kingship,
and today I'll be coming back

00:00:12.197 --> 00:00:15.051
frequently to the Israelite
notions of kingship and royal

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.197
ideology.
But to start off:

00:00:17.197 --> 00:00:20.936
one of the most important
things to realize is that the

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:24.328
king in Israel was not divine,
as he was in Egypt,

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.060
or even semi-divine.
 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.119
Occasionally,
he offered sacrifice but he

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.230
didn't play a regular role in
the cult.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.159
Israelite royal ideology was
heavily indebted to Canaanite

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:37.989
royal ideology.
You have similar language

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.110
that's applied to the kings of
Israel.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.275
The king is said to be
appointed by the deity or

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:46.710
deities to end wickedness,
to enlighten the land,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.904
he is the channel of prosperity
and divine blessing for the

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:51.822
nation.
All of this is true of

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.214
Canaanite kings as well,
and the king,

00:00:54.214 --> 00:00:57.060
as we've seen,
is spoken of as God's son.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.910
That doesn't imply divinity.
 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.189
It's a metaphor,
the metaphor of sonship.

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:03.828
It was used for the Canaanite
gods as well,

00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:07.409
and it expressed the special
relationship between the king

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.146
and the deity.
It was the same relationship as

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.790
was found between that of a
suzerain and a vassal,

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.819
and in our suzerainty treaties,
also, the vassal is the son of

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.664
the suzerain.
It's a kind of adoption,

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:24.144
and what it means is that the
one who is metaphorically the

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:27.080
son is to serve the father
loyally,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.047
faithfully, but is also
susceptible to chastisement from

00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:32.963
him.
And that's what we saw in

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:35.872
Nathan's statement or
pronouncement or prophecy to

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:39.237
David last time.
Michael Coogan points out that

00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:43.489
the notion of the sonship of the
king was revolutionary.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.228
It was a deliberate effort to
replace an earlier understanding

00:01:47.228 --> 00:01:51.090
according to which the entire
nation of Israel was God's son.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.998
You remember during the plagues
in Egypt when God refers to

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:59.110
Pharaoh as having oppressed His
son, Israel, His firstborn.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.284
As Yahweh's son,
the king now is standing

00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:05.459
between God and the people as a
whole.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.565
And we're going to return in a
moment to this new royal

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:12.246
ideology and what's really going
to be a very tense juxtaposition

00:02:12.246 --> 00:02:14.030
with the covenant theology.
 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.036
But first I want to say a
little bit more about the

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:20.765
characters of David and Solomon
before going into the way royal

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.750
ideology was later developed.
 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.461
In the Bible,
David is second only in

00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.699
importance and in textual space
to Moses;

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.502
the amount of space that's
devoted to him,

00:02:31.502 --> 00:02:33.280
is second only to Moses.
 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.150
There are three characteristics
of David which stand out,

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.713
and the first is that he's
described as being quite

00:02:38.713 --> 00:02:41.635
proficient in music and poetry
and so we'll see that later

00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:44.865
tradition is going to attribute
to him not only the invention of

00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:47.838
various instruments but also the
composition of the Book of

00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:50.219
Psalms.
It seems to make sense that he

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.188
would be the composer of the
Book of Psalms in that he has a

00:02:53.188 --> 00:02:54.949
reputation for poetry and music.
 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.417
He is also credited with great
military and tactical skill and

00:02:59.417 --> 00:03:02.387
confidence.
He deploys his army on behalf

00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:05.032
of Israel but he also,
once he is king,

00:03:05.032 --> 00:03:08.719
deploys his army within Israel
against his rivals.

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.300
Third, he is depicted as a very
shrewd politician.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.115
And it was David who created
permanent symbols of God's

00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:20.082
election of Israel,
God's election of David

00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.935
himself,
God's election of David's house

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:26.430
or line or dynasty to rule over
Israel in perpetuity.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.930
It is said that he conceived
the idea of a royal capital.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.349
He captured the city of Jebus,
Yebus--it was a border town so

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.629
it was free of any tribal
association.

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.849
I guess it's sort of like
Washington, D.C.;

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.030
it's not located really within
any one tribe;

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.770
and he captured this and built
it up as the city of David.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.317
The city was going to be
renamed Jerusalem and it would

00:03:47.317 --> 00:03:49.879
become understood as the chosen
city,

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.256
the place where God caused His
name to dwell:

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:54.848
as Deuteronomy said,
there would be a place where

00:03:54.848 --> 00:03:57.440
God would choose to cause His
name to dwell.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.657
And so Jerusalem becomes a
symbol of God's presence,

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:04.189
it becomes a symbol of Israel's
kingdom, the monarchy;

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.030
it becomes a symbol of the
dynasty of David.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.990
It is referred to as the City
of David.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.804
David transfers the Ark to this
city and so he makes it the home

00:04:12.804 --> 00:04:16.680
to the ancient witness of the
covenant, the Sinaitic Covenant.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.364
The added implication is that
the Davidic dynasty has

00:04:20.364 --> 00:04:23.339
inherited the blessings of the
covenant.

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.645
It is somehow fulfilling the
promise to the patriarchs,

00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:30.439
which is also associated with
the nation of Israel at Sinai.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:33.927
He planned a temple that would
become the permanent resting

00:04:33.927 --> 00:04:37.475
place for the ark and a cultic
center for all Israel but the

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:41.203
building of this temple was left
to Solomon so we'll discuss it

00:04:41.203 --> 00:04:44.029
and its symbolism when we get to
Solomon.

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:47.523
But according to the biblical
record it was still David who

00:04:47.523 --> 00:04:50.121
made the chosen dynasty,
the chosen city,

00:04:50.121 --> 00:04:53.604
what would eventually be the
temple, into permanent and

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:57.410
deeply interconnected symbols of
the religion of Israel.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.969
And it's really with David that
the history of Jerusalem as the

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.060
Holy City begins.
 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.239
Now the biblical assessment of
David is initially relatively

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:10.207
positive, and this changes
shortly after his ascension to

00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:12.832
the throne.
Beginning in 2 Samuel from

00:05:12.832 --> 00:05:16.257
about chapter 9 to 20 and then
on into the first couple of

00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:19.151
chapters of Kings,
you have a stretch of text

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:22.478
which is often referred to as
the Court History or the

00:05:22.478 --> 00:05:24.550
succession narrative of David.
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.289
The critical question that
drives this particular

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.029
historical fiction is the
question of succession:

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:31.569
who will succeed David?
 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.479
He has many children but one by
one his sons are killed,

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.962
or they're displaced or
disqualified in one way or

00:05:38.962 --> 00:05:42.089
another, until finally there is
Solomon.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:47.065
There are lots of wonderful
major and minor characters in

00:05:47.065 --> 00:05:50.015
this drama.
It's a very complex drama,

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.676
lots of intrigue and passion,
but the material in this

00:05:53.676 --> 00:05:57.819
section also presents a rather
unusual portrait of David.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:02.529
He's weak, he's indecisive,
he's something of an anti-hero.

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.057
He stays home in the palace
while other people are off

00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:08.720
leading battles and fighting the
wars.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.281
He enters into an illicit
relationship with a married

00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:14.610
woman, Bathsheva (or Bathsheba).
 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.418
He sees to it that her husband
is killed in battle to cover up

00:06:18.418 --> 00:06:21.474
his affair.
It's this combined act of

00:06:21.474 --> 00:06:26.412
adultery and murder that earns
him a sound scolding from

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:29.000
Nathan,
the prophet Nathan--we'll come

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.649
to that when we talk about
prophets next week.

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.329
But God punishes him with the
death of his son.

00:06:35.329 --> 00:06:39.914
And it's really from this point
on in the story that we see

00:06:39.914 --> 00:06:43.550
David losing control over events
around him;

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.769
his control declines.
 

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:50.790
He is indecisive on the whole
question of succession and that

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.279
leads to all kinds of resentment
and conflict as well as revolts.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:58.642
There's one revolt,
which is a revolt in support of

00:06:58.642 --> 00:06:59.920
his son, Absalom.
 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.905
That's a revolt that the
Deuteronomistic historian also

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.112
indicates was a punishment for
his affair with--for David's

00:07:06.112 --> 00:07:07.550
affair with Bathsheba.
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.205
But during this revolt David
flees from his enemies,

00:07:11.205 --> 00:07:14.360
he's stripped of his crown,
he's degraded.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.800
When Absalom is killed David
weeps for his son uncontrollably

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.649
and this only angers his own
supporters who fought so

00:07:22.649 --> 00:07:25.980
earnestly against Absalom in his
defense;

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.660
it's a very poignant moment.
 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.808
But by the end of the story,
David is almost completely

00:07:31.808 --> 00:07:33.959
impotent, and senile even.
 

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:36.986
The prophet Nathan and
Bathsheba plot to have

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:40.219
Bathsheba's son,
Solomon, named the successor of

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:43.934
David and there really is no
point at which there's any

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:48.129
divine indication that Solomon
has won divine approval,

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:50.319
no divine indication that he is
the one.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.259
It happens through palace
intrigue, particularly with

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.560
Bathsheba and Nathan.
 

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.808
But the northern tribes--there
are signs throughout the story

00:07:57.808 --> 00:08:01.002
of the hostility of the northern
tribes and that's a warning

00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:03.463
sign,
that's a warning sign of future

00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:06.121
disunity.
This whole court history is

00:08:06.121 --> 00:08:09.339
just a wonderful,
masterful work of prose.

00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:12.851
You're going to be reading
something from a book by a

00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:16.296
fellow named Meir Sternberg,
which is I think just a

00:08:16.296 --> 00:08:19.199
wonderful study of the Bathsheba
story.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:24.050
Some speak about all of this
unit as being authored by the J

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.584
source.
You need to know that source

00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:29.339
theory has undergone so many
permutations.

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:32.580
There really isn't any standard
view but I think the idea that

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.095
the sources J,
E, P and D extend beyond the

00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:38.484
Pentateuch is now generally no
longer accepted so you will

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:41.993
sometimes see people talking
about the J source as going all

00:08:41.993 --> 00:08:45.026
the way through the end of
Second Kings and being in

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:48.000
fact--J is the author of the
court history.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.963
But for the most part I think
most people think of the source

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.889
theory as applying to the
Pentateuch,

00:08:52.889 --> 00:08:56.344
and beyond that we talk about
the Deuteronomistic historian

00:08:56.344 --> 00:08:58.370
redacting older earlier sources.
 

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.991
I'll talk a little bit more
about some of those sources as

00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:03.522
we move through the later books,
the books of the former

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:06.405
prophets.
The court history has an array

00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:08.919
of very richly drawn characters.
 

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:14.115
They act out all sorts of
scenes of power and lust and

00:09:14.115 --> 00:09:16.370
courage and struggle.
 

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:18.509
There's crime,
there's tender love.

00:09:18.509 --> 00:09:22.200
It's a very realistic sort of
psychological drama.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.190
It's also striking for its
uncompromising honesty.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.570
We don't see anything like that
really in the work of any

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:31.080
contemporary historian.
 

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.679
David is depicted in very,
very human terms.

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:38.391
The flattery and the
whitewashing that you find in

00:09:38.391 --> 00:09:42.558
other ancient Near Eastern
dynastic histories is lacking

00:09:42.558 --> 00:09:44.858
here.
The flattery and whitewashing

00:09:44.858 --> 00:09:47.648
that we get for example in
Chronicles, the books of

00:09:47.648 --> 00:09:49.840
Chronicles,
are really just a retelling of

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.709
the material here in the former
prophets and they clean up the

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:53.649
picture of David.
 

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:55.909
There's no mention of Bathsheba
in there.

00:09:55.909 --> 00:09:59.114
So you do have that kind of
whitewashing as part of the

00:09:59.114 --> 00:10:02.495
historiography of the Book of
Chronicles, but it's lacking

00:10:02.495 --> 00:10:04.153
here.
All of the flaws,

00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:08.051
all of the weaknesses of David,
a national hero--they're all

00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:10.380
laid bare.
Implicitly perhaps,

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.779
that is a critique of kinship.
 

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.586
It is perhaps a critique of the
claim of kings to rule by divine

00:10:16.586 --> 00:10:18.528
right.
The author here seems to be

00:10:18.528 --> 00:10:20.743
stressing that David and,
as we shall see,

00:10:20.743 --> 00:10:23.661
Solomon (he's quite human,
Solomon's quite human)--they

00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:25.120
are not at all divine.
 

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.180
They're subject to the errors
and flaws that characterize all

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.870
humans.
As we move out of Samuel now

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.509
and into 1 and 2 Kings,
we see that these books,

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:40.120
Kings, contain the history of
Israel from the death of King

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.220
David until the fall of Judah in
587,

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.940
586, and the exile to Babylonia.
 

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.750
These books also appear to be
based on older sources.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.720
Some of them are explicitly
identified.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.734
They will refer sometimes to
these works, which evidently

00:10:54.734 --> 00:10:57.856
were subsequently lost but
they'll refer to the Book of the

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:00.870
Acts of Solomon or the Book of
the Annals of the Kings of

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.004
Israel,
or the Book of the Annals of

00:11:03.004 --> 00:11:04.029
the Kings of Judah.
 

00:11:04.029 --> 00:11:06.700
Annals and chronicles were
regularly maintained in royal

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.740
courts throughout the Ancient
Near East.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.428
There's no reason to think that
this wasn't also done in a royal

00:11:12.428 --> 00:11:13.600
setting in Israel.
 

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.885
These annals generally listed
events, important events in the

00:11:16.885 --> 00:11:18.200
reign of a given king.
 

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.095
They tended not to have much
narrative to them and the

00:11:21.095 --> 00:11:23.991
beginning of the first 16
chapters of 1 Kings has that

00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:26.078
kind of feel,
not a lot of narrative,

00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:27.690
and really reportage of events.
 

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.843
Beginning in 1 Kings 17:17-22,
and the first nine chapters of

00:11:33.843 --> 00:11:39.279
2 Kings, there's a departure
from that annal style,

00:11:39.279 --> 00:11:44.019
annal genre the reporting of
events in the reign of a king.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:47.492
You have more developed
narratives in those sources and

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:50.450
these narratives generally
feature prophets.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.320
So it's going to lead very
nicely into our study of

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.100
Prophets beginning on Monday.
 

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.934
Some of the narratives
evidently would have circulated

00:11:57.934 --> 00:12:00.179
independently,
particularly the stories,

00:12:00.179 --> 00:12:03.805
probably, about Elijah and
Elisha, these zealous

00:12:03.805 --> 00:12:05.580
Yahweh-only prophets.
 

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.827
They were probably local heroes
and these stories circulated

00:12:08.827 --> 00:12:11.304
independently,
but they've come to be embedded

00:12:11.304 --> 00:12:14.442
in a framework that conforms
those sources to the ideology

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:18.020
and religious perspective of the
Deuteronomistic historian.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.490
1 Kings 2 is the death scene.
 

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.258
It has David's deathbed
instructions to his son,

00:12:26.258 --> 00:12:29.157
Solomon.
He tells Solomon to kill all of

00:12:29.157 --> 00:12:32.539
his rivals and opponents and in
verse 12 we read,

00:12:32.539 --> 00:12:35.235
"And Solomon sat upon the
throne of his father,

00:12:35.235 --> 00:12:37.929
David, and his rule was firmly
established."

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:41.625
And it seems that at this point
the three crises that we noted

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:44.788
in the Book of Samuel,
at the opening at 1 Samuel,

00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:47.320
the three crises we noted are
resolved.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.779
The crisis in succession is
resolved.

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:53.343
David is succeeded by his son,
Solomon, and all of the kings

00:12:53.343 --> 00:12:55.879
of Judah for the next 400 years
in fact,

00:12:55.879 --> 00:13:00.928
until the destruction in 586,
all of these kings will be of

00:13:00.928 --> 00:13:02.669
the line of David.
 

00:13:02.669 --> 00:13:06.649
The military crises seem for
now to have been resolved.

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:10.213
We've had lots of military and
diplomatic successes and Israel

00:13:10.213 --> 00:13:11.440
seems to be secure.
 

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.250
And also the religious crisis
that we mentioned is resolved.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.513
The Ark was retaken from the
Philistines, it's been brought

00:13:18.513 --> 00:13:20.482
to Jerusalem,
it's been installed in

00:13:20.482 --> 00:13:23.212
Jerusalem,
and now a magnificent temple is

00:13:23.212 --> 00:13:26.973
planned that will house the Ark
and be a site for the central

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:28.539
worship of all Israel.
 

00:13:28.539 --> 00:13:33.429
But the resolution of these
crises came at a cost.

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:37.690
They produced fundamental
changes in Israelite society.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:41.005
From a loose confederation of
tribes--however idealistic that

00:13:41.005 --> 00:13:44.265
picture was--but from a loose
confederation of tribes united

00:13:44.265 --> 00:13:47.199
by a covenant,
we've now got a nation with a

00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:50.809
strong central administration,
it's headed by a king.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:54.549
And that king seems to enjoy a
special covenant with God.

00:13:54.549 --> 00:13:58.691
Rather than charismatic leaders
who rise as the need itself

00:13:58.691 --> 00:14:02.475
arises and then fade away,
we now have permanent kings

00:14:02.475 --> 00:14:04.259
from a single family.
 

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:07.650
And preserved in the biblical
sources is a tension,

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:11.990
a tension between the old ideas
of the covenant confederation,

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.827
what we might call covenant
theology, and the new ideology

00:14:15.827 --> 00:14:19.073
of the monarchy.
This new royal ideology

00:14:19.073 --> 00:14:23.404
combines loyalty to God and
loyalty to the throne,

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:28.532
so that treason or rebellion
against God's anointed is also

00:14:28.532 --> 00:14:31.405
apostasy,
it's also rebellion against God

00:14:31.405 --> 00:14:34.960
Himself.
The two become conflated.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.876
There's a scholar named Jon
Levenson, I've talked about him

00:14:37.876 --> 00:14:40.389
before in connection with the
covenant at Sinai,

00:14:40.389 --> 00:14:43.792
but in this wonderful book
called Sinai and Zion he

00:14:43.792 --> 00:14:46.240
really juxtaposes these two
ideologies.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.569
He points to this deep tension
between the covenant theology

00:14:49.569 --> 00:14:50.980
and the royal ideology.
 

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.190
In covenant theology,
Yahweh alone is the king.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.061
He's got a direct
suzerain-vassal relationship

00:14:57.061 --> 00:15:00.381
with the people.
So Israel is the subject of

00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:01.909
covenant theology.
 

00:15:01.909 --> 00:15:05.544
The covenant theology therefore
implies almost automatically a

00:15:05.544 --> 00:15:09.059
somewhat negative view of the
monarchy and that's what we've

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:12.613
seen here and there,
in the Book of Judges and in

00:15:12.613 --> 00:15:15.875
Samuel.
Monarchy is at best unnecessary

00:15:15.875 --> 00:15:19.129
and at worst it's a rejection of
God.

00:15:19.129 --> 00:15:22.061
Nevertheless,
despite that resistance or that

00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:25.127
critique, monarchy,
kingship, is established in

00:15:25.127 --> 00:15:27.576
Israel,
and Levenson sees the royal

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:31.074
ideology that developed to
support this institution as a

00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:34.316
major revolution in the
structure of the religion of

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.296
Israel.
Where the Sinaitic Covenant was

00:15:37.296 --> 00:15:41.659
contracted between God and the
nation, the Davidic covenant is

00:15:41.659 --> 00:15:44.948
contracted between God and a
single individual,

00:15:44.948 --> 00:15:46.900
the king.
The covenant with

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.025
David--another scholar,
Moshe Weinfeld,

00:15:49.025 --> 00:15:51.149
whom I've mentioned before as
well,

00:15:51.149 --> 00:15:54.549
he describes the covenant with
David as a covenant of grant.

00:15:54.549 --> 00:15:58.970
This is a form that we find in
the ancient Near East also.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:03.720
It's a grant of a reward for
loyal service and deeds.

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:08.140
And so God rewards David with
the gift of an unending dynasty.

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.210
It's a covenant of grant.
 

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.736
He grants him this unending
dynasty in exchange for his

00:16:12.736 --> 00:16:14.911
loyalty.
And the contrast with the

00:16:14.911 --> 00:16:16.919
covenant at Sinai is very clear.
 

00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:19.663
Where Israel's covenant with
God at Sinai had been

00:16:19.663 --> 00:16:23.078
conditional--it's premised on
the observance of God's Torah if

00:16:23.078 --> 00:16:25.773
there's violation,
then God will uproot the

00:16:25.773 --> 00:16:29.431
Israelites and throw them out of
the land --the covenant with

00:16:29.431 --> 00:16:30.818
David,
by contrast,

00:16:30.818 --> 00:16:35.013
with his dynastic house (and by
implication with David's city

00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:38.622
and the temple atop Mount Zion),
that covenant will be

00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:40.450
maintained under all conditions.
 

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.403
Remember the passage that we
read of Nathan's prophecy last

00:16:43.403 --> 00:16:45.487
time.
So the royal ideology fostered

00:16:45.487 --> 00:16:48.711
a belief in some quarters,
and we'll see this in the next

00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:52.008
few weeks,
a belief in the inviolability,

00:16:52.008 --> 00:16:55.405
the impregnable nature of,
David's house,

00:16:55.405 --> 00:16:57.299
dynasty,
the city itself,

00:16:57.299 --> 00:16:59.460
the chosen city,
the sacred mountain,

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.450
the temple.
We'll return to this idea in

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.444
later lectures.
So you have this deep tension

00:17:05.444 --> 00:17:08.547
lining up Israel's covenant at
Mount Sinai, which is

00:17:08.547 --> 00:17:10.365
conditional,
on the one hand,

00:17:10.365 --> 00:17:13.873
with God's covenant with David,
which is centered on the temple

00:17:13.873 --> 00:17:15.910
and palace complex at Mount
Zion,

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:20.099
and which is unconditional and
permanent.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.748
Scholars have tried to account
for these two strands of

00:17:23.748 --> 00:17:27.329
tradition in Biblical literature
in different ways;

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.542
the covenant theology with its
emphasis on the conditional

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:32.910
covenant with Moses contracted
at Sinai;

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:35.926
the royal ideology and its
emphasis on the unconditional

00:17:35.926 --> 00:17:38.339
covenant with David focused on
Mount Zion.

00:17:38.339 --> 00:17:40.862
One explanation is
chronological--that early

00:17:40.862 --> 00:17:44.557
traditions were centered around
the Sinai event and the covenant

00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:46.881
theology.
They emphasize that aspect of

00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:49.897
the relationship with God,
and later traditions under the

00:17:49.897 --> 00:17:51.890
monarchy emphasize royal
ideology.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.849
Another explanation is
geographical.

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:57.724
The northern kingdom,
which if you'll recall and

00:17:57.724 --> 00:18:00.936
we'll talk about in a moment,
the northern kingdom is going

00:18:00.936 --> 00:18:03.795
to break away from the southern
kingdom (Davidides will not rule

00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:06.609
in the northern kingdom) so the
assumption is that the northern

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:09.089
kingdom,
which rejected the house of

00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:13.430
David--they de-emphasize a royal
ideology and its focus on Zion

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.867
and the house of David,
and they emphasize the old

00:18:16.867 --> 00:18:19.480
covenant theology and the Sinai
theology.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.924
And by contrast the southern
kingdom, in which a member of

00:18:22.924 --> 00:18:26.369
the house of David reigned right
until the destruction,

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:30.213
the southern kingdom emphasized
Zion and its attendant royal

00:18:30.213 --> 00:18:32.561
ideology.
Well, Levenson rejects both of

00:18:32.561 --> 00:18:33.650
these explanations.
 

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.267
He says it isn't that one is
early and one is late,

00:18:36.267 --> 00:18:38.990
it isn't that one is northern
and one is southern.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.038
We find the Sinai and the Zion
traditions in early texts and

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:45.214
late texts.
We find them in northern texts

00:18:45.214 --> 00:18:46.200
and in southern texts.
 

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.695
In the south,
David's house was criticized

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:51.859
just as roundly as it was
criticized in the north,

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:55.435
and emphasis was placed on the
Sinai covenant over against the

00:18:55.435 --> 00:18:58.599
royal ideology in the south as
well as in the north.

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:01.091
So the two traditions he said
coexisted side by side,

00:19:01.091 --> 00:19:03.582
they stood in a dialectic
tension with one another in

00:19:03.582 --> 00:19:05.589
Israel.
And eventually they would come

00:19:05.589 --> 00:19:08.302
to be coordinated and work
together, we'll see that more

00:19:08.302 --> 00:19:09.980
towards the end of the lecture.
 

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:14.359
But he says that the Zion
ideology will take on some of

00:19:14.359 --> 00:19:17.359
the aspects of the legacy of
Sinai.

00:19:17.359 --> 00:19:20.796
Mount Zion will soon be
associated with the site of

00:19:20.796 --> 00:19:23.339
God's theophony or
self-revelation;

00:19:23.339 --> 00:19:26.940
it will become a kind of Sinai
now permanently in Jerusalem.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.799
It would become the site of
covenant renewal.

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:32.331
It will be seen as the place
where Torah goes forth,

00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:35.012
and that's an idea of course
originally associated with

00:19:35.012 --> 00:19:38.089
Sinai--that's where God's
instruction or Torah went first.

00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:41.668
But all of these features will
be collapsed or telescoped or

00:19:41.668 --> 00:19:44.640
brought into Mount Zion and the
temple complex.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.458
But eventually,
he says, it's not simply that

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:51.493
the Sinai covenant theology was
absorbed into the royal ideology

00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:55.020
and Mount Zion,
because the entitlement of the

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.256
house of David will eventually
be made contingent on the

00:19:59.256 --> 00:20:01.490
observance of God's Torah.
 

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:03.303
The king himself,
we will see,

00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:06.930
is not exempt from the covenant
conditions set at Sinai.

00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:10.264
And even though he would never
be completely deposed for

00:20:10.264 --> 00:20:13.780
violating the Sinaitic Covenant
he will be punished for his

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.000
violations.
The two will work in tandem.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.619
It's an idea that we'll return
to.

00:20:17.619 --> 00:20:20.093
We'll see it more clearly as we
get towards the end of this

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:21.640
lecture.
But for now keep in mind that

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.918
the two are going to be held in
tension and work together to

00:20:23.918 --> 00:20:24.730
check one another.
 

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:29.045
Now David's son,
Solomon, is given mixed reviews

00:20:29.045 --> 00:20:32.259
by the Deuteronomistic
historian.

00:20:32.259 --> 00:20:34.173
He ascends to the throne
through intrigue,

00:20:34.173 --> 00:20:36.973
as I said, there's really no
indication of a divine choice or

00:20:36.973 --> 00:20:39.588
approval,
but he's said to reign over a

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:42.062
golden age.
His kingdom is said to stretch

00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:43.650
from Egypt to the Euphrates.
 

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.365
He made political alliances and
economic alliances throughout

00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:49.678
the region.
He would seal these alliances

00:20:49.678 --> 00:20:51.455
with marriages.
He married a daughter of

00:20:51.455 --> 00:20:53.502
Pharaoh.
He married the daughter of the

00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:55.589
king of Tyre in Phoenicia and so
on.

00:20:55.589 --> 00:20:59.009
The text claims that he built a
daunting military establishment:

00:20:59.009 --> 00:21:02.197
he put a wall around Jerusalem,
there were fortified

00:21:02.197 --> 00:21:04.993
cities--Hazor,
Megiddo, Gezer--these were

00:21:04.993 --> 00:21:07.440
bases for his professional army.
 

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.694
It's said that the army
featured a very expensive

00:21:10.694 --> 00:21:14.058
chariot force.
He also had accomplishments in

00:21:14.058 --> 00:21:16.640
the realms of industry and
trade.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.313
He exploited Israel's natural
position straddling the

00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:24.623
north-south trade routes and was
able to bring great wealth to

00:21:24.623 --> 00:21:26.460
the state in that way.
 

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:30.060
The daily supplies that were
needed to maintain Solomon's

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.890
very lavish court are detailed
in 1 Kings,

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:37.060
so it seems to have been an
extraordinarily elaborate court.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.799
He developed a merchant fleet.
 

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.754
He seemed to work closely with
the Phoenicians and the

00:21:41.754 --> 00:21:44.820
Phoenician King Hiram in
developing a merchant fleet and

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.440
exploited trade routes through
the Red Sea.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.912
All sorts of exotic products
are listed as coming in to

00:21:50.912 --> 00:21:53.869
Jerusalem from Arabia and the
African coast.

00:21:53.869 --> 00:21:57.220
We have the famous story of the
visit of the queen of Sheba.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.486
This could possibly be the
Sabean territory in South Arabia

00:22:00.486 --> 00:22:03.810
and there may be some basis in
fact given these trade routes

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:06.569
and how well traveled they were
at this time.

00:22:06.569 --> 00:22:09.476
And of course he is known for
his magnificent building

00:22:09.476 --> 00:22:12.605
operations.
Many scholars assume that given

00:22:12.605 --> 00:22:16.891
this tremendous wealth this
would have been a time for a

00:22:16.891 --> 00:22:20.127
flowering of the arts,
and so it's often been

00:22:20.127 --> 00:22:23.520
maintained that this would have
been the time for the early

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.236
traditions,
biblical traditions,

00:22:25.236 --> 00:22:27.254
early traditions of the nation
to be recorded,

00:22:27.254 --> 00:22:28.329
perhaps the J source.
 

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:31.730
People date it to the tenth
century, the time of Solomon.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.550
But we should be a little
skeptical of this grand picture

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.575
because archaeologists have
found that Jerusalem was a small

00:22:39.575 --> 00:22:41.860
town;
it was a very small town really

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.825
until the end of the eighth
century suddenly it absorbed

00:22:44.825 --> 00:22:47.789
many refugees from the fall of
the northern kingdom.

00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:50.907
Remember Israel is going to be
destroyed in 722,

00:22:50.907 --> 00:22:55.019
so refugees fleeing southward
will greatly expand Jerusalem;

00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:57.240
we have archaeological evidence
of that.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.783
But there are very few material
remains that attest to a

00:23:00.783 --> 00:23:04.520
fabulous empire on a scale
that's suggested by the biblical

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.010
text.
Hazor, Megiddo,

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.529
and Gezer, the three places
that are mentioned as fortified

00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:12.259
military bases,
these have been excavated.

00:23:12.259 --> 00:23:15.805
They do show some great
gateways and some large

00:23:15.805 --> 00:23:19.891
chambers, even some stables,
but archaeologists differ

00:23:19.891 --> 00:23:23.359
radically over the dating of
these lairs.

00:23:23.359 --> 00:23:26.450
Some date them to the time of
Solomon, some see it as later.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:31.682
Most concur that Israel was
probably at this time the most

00:23:31.682 --> 00:23:36.381
important power in its region,
but still it would have been

00:23:36.381 --> 00:23:39.400
small and relatively
insignificant compared to,

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:42.144
say, Egypt or Mesopotamia,
some of the great civilizations

00:23:42.144 --> 00:23:44.069
at either end of the Fertile
Crescent.

00:23:44.069 --> 00:23:47.175
But it would have been the most
important state in that area and

00:23:47.175 --> 00:23:50.182
probably was able to have some
dominance over some neighboring

00:23:50.182 --> 00:23:52.739
areas as well.
I just want to mention three

00:23:52.739 --> 00:23:55.720
things about Solomon,
things that he's noted for.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.490
One is that he's praised for
his wisdom and because,

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:01.532
again, the biblical text
praises him for his wisdom later

00:24:01.532 --> 00:24:04.466
tradition will find it
convenient to attribute the Book

00:24:04.466 --> 00:24:07.779
of Proverbs to him as well as
the Book of Ecclesiastes.

00:24:07.779 --> 00:24:10.472
These are two works that belong
to the genre of wisdom

00:24:10.472 --> 00:24:13.420
literature we'll be talking
about later in the semester.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.372
Second, in addition to being
praised for his wisdom,

00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:19.555
he's praised for constructing
the temple and in fact the

00:24:19.555 --> 00:24:22.450
primary focus of all of the
biblical material,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.008
or the biblical story of
Solomon, is the building of the

00:24:26.008 --> 00:24:29.567
temple, the dedication of this
temple for the Ark of the

00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:31.250
Covenant in Jerusalem.
 

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.969
He continued the close
association of the cult and the

00:24:35.969 --> 00:24:40.509
monarchy, the religious and
political leadership,

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:44.088
by constructing this
magnificent new temple within

00:24:44.088 --> 00:24:48.470
the palace complex and he
himself appointed a high priest.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.955
So the juxtaposition of the
house of the king and the house

00:24:51.955 --> 00:24:54.960
of the deity on Mount Zion was
quite deliberate.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.273
And this hill,
even though geographically it's

00:24:58.273 --> 00:25:02.323
very small, becomes in the
mythic imagination of Israel,

00:25:02.323 --> 00:25:05.490
this towering and impregnable
mountain.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:11.346
Levenson again argues that Zion
came eventually to take on the

00:25:11.346 --> 00:25:14.609
features of the cosmic mountain.
 

00:25:14.609 --> 00:25:17.593
The cosmic mountain is a mythic
symbol that we find in the

00:25:17.593 --> 00:25:18.640
ancient Near East.
 

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.995
The cosmic mountain has these
powers or potencies that are

00:25:22.995 --> 00:25:27.198
universal and infinite and we
find it in the religion of

00:25:27.198 --> 00:25:30.776
Israel as well,
specifically in connection with

00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:33.166
Mount Zion.
The cosmic mountain in ancient

00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:36.246
tradition was understood to be
the meeting place of the gods

00:25:36.246 --> 00:25:38.981
like a Mount Olympus,
for example–it's a cosmic

00:25:38.981 --> 00:25:41.226
mountain.
But it was also understood to

00:25:41.226 --> 00:25:44.444
be the axis mundi,
that is to say the juncture or

00:25:44.444 --> 00:25:47.369
the point of junction between
heaven and earth,

00:25:47.369 --> 00:25:51.291
the meeting place of heaven and
earth, the axis around which

00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:53.750
these worlds met or were
conjoined.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:57.283
In Canaan--in Canaanite
religion the Mountain of Baal,

00:25:57.283 --> 00:26:01.416
which is known as Mount Zaphon,
was conceived precisely in this

00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:03.798
manner.
And Levenson points out

00:26:03.798 --> 00:26:07.382
tremendous commonalities of
language and concept in

00:26:07.382 --> 00:26:10.250
connection with the Mountain of
Baal,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:12.490
the Mountain of El,
and the Mountain of Yahweh.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:16.563
In fact, the word "Zaphon,"
Mount Zaphon is used to describe

00:26:16.563 --> 00:26:20.430
God's mountain in the Bible in
one particular passage.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.701
So the temple on Mount Zion
came to be understood as sacred

00:26:23.701 --> 00:26:27.029
space much like the cosmic
mountains of other traditions.

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:29.745
It's described as a kind of
paradise sometimes,

00:26:29.745 --> 00:26:31.279
almost a Garden of Eden.
 

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:34.478
It's described as the place
from which the entire world was

00:26:34.478 --> 00:26:37.114
created.
It's also viewed as a kind of

00:26:37.114 --> 00:26:40.062
epitome of the world,
a kind of microcosm,

00:26:40.062 --> 00:26:42.650
an entire microcosm of the
world.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:46.673
It's also seen as the earthly
manifestation of a heavenly

00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:49.986
temple.
The temple came to represent an

00:26:49.986 --> 00:26:52.049
ideal and sacred realm.
 

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:55.009
And we also see it as the
object of intense longing.

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:57.665
Many of the Psalms will express
intense longing:

00:26:57.665 --> 00:26:59.700
if I could just sit in the
temple,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.106
if I could just be in that
space, that sacred space--we see

00:27:04.106 --> 00:27:05.549
it in the Psalms.
 

00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:09.331
In a passage describing the
dedication of the temple–it's

00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:13.374
in 1 Kings 8--Solomon explains
that the temple is a place where

00:27:13.374 --> 00:27:15.329
people have access to God.
 

00:27:15.329 --> 00:27:18.990
They can petition to Him and
they can atone for their sins.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:22.754
It is a house of prayer,
he says, and it remained the

00:27:22.754 --> 00:27:26.880
central focal point of Israelite
worship for centuries.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.807
So his great wisdom,
his great virtue in

00:27:29.807 --> 00:27:32.960
constructing the temple
notwithstanding,

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.057
Solomon is very sharply
criticized for,

00:27:36.057 --> 00:27:39.480
among other things,
his foreign worship.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.019
His new palace complex had a
tremendous amount of room for

00:27:44.019 --> 00:27:48.319
his harem, which is said to have
included 700 wives.

00:27:48.319 --> 00:27:51.623
Many of them were foreign
princesses, many of them would

00:27:51.623 --> 00:27:55.048
have been acquired to seal
political alliances or business

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:56.609
alliances, noblewomen.
 

00:27:56.609 --> 00:28:00.718
700 wives and 300 concubines,
as well as various officials

00:28:00.718 --> 00:28:03.762
and servants.
Now of course these numbers are

00:28:03.762 --> 00:28:06.484
likely exaggerated,
but Solomon's diplomatic

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:10.345
alliances likely necessitated
unions that would of course have

00:28:10.345 --> 00:28:13.700
been condemned by the
Deuteronomistic historian.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:15.969
He is said to have loved
foreign women,

00:28:15.969 --> 00:28:19.432
from the nations that God had
forbidden and he succumbed to

00:28:19.432 --> 00:28:22.060
the worship of their gods and
goddesses,

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:23.529
which is really the key point.
 

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:26.923
The whole fear of a foreign
spouse is that one will be led

00:28:26.923 --> 00:28:30.019
to or will support the worship
of foreign deities,

00:28:30.019 --> 00:28:34.490
and so Solomon is said to have
built temples for Moabite gods

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.980
and Ammonite gods.
 

00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.983
This all may point to a general
tolerance for different cults in

00:28:39.983 --> 00:28:43.670
Jerusalem in the tenth century
and in the ninth century.

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:47.260
This may not have been an issue
in Jerusalem in the tenth and

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.954
ninth century,
but it's an issue for the later

00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:51.570
Deuteronomistic editor.
 

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.779
They have no tolerance this.
 

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:58.036
So Solomon's primary flaw in
the Deuteronomistic historians'

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:01.289
view is his syncretism,
which is prompted by his

00:29:01.289 --> 00:29:05.033
marriages to these foreign women
who brought their native cults

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:07.946
to Jerusalem.
His religious infidelity is

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:12.057
said to be the cause of the
severe problems and ultimately

00:29:12.057 --> 00:29:16.599
the division of the kingdom that
will follow upon his death.

00:29:16.599 --> 00:29:21.168
In order to support this
tremendous court and harem,

00:29:21.168 --> 00:29:24.930
as well as the army and the
bureaucracy,

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:28.303
Solomon did introduce heavy
taxation as well as the

00:29:28.303 --> 00:29:30.933
corvée,
which is forced labor or

00:29:30.933 --> 00:29:33.430
required labor on state
projects.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:36.289
So you have this developing
urban structure,

00:29:36.289 --> 00:29:39.415
complex developing,
bureaucratic urban structure

00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:43.339
that's now being superimposed on
the agricultural life,

00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:47.142
and that leads to all sorts of
class distinctions and class

00:29:47.142 --> 00:29:49.907
divisions between officials,
bureaucrats,

00:29:49.907 --> 00:29:53.298
merchants, large-scale
landowners who are prospering

00:29:53.298 --> 00:29:57.288
perhaps, smaller farmers and
shepherds who are living at more

00:29:57.288 --> 00:29:59.150
of a subsistence level.
 

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.403
So you have divisions between
town and country,

00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:02.579
between rich and poor.
 

00:30:02.579 --> 00:30:05.599
And this is a great change from
the ideals of the tribal

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:08.893
democracy, some of the ideals
that some of you looked at when

00:30:08.893 --> 00:30:10.980
we were talking about legal
texts,

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.100
where there seemed to be these
economic blueprints for bringing

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.689
about economic equivalence
through sabbatical years and

00:30:18.689 --> 00:30:20.549
jubilee years and so on.
 

00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:25.789
In short, the list of social
and economic ills that were

00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:29.410
enumerated by Samuel (in 1
Samuel 8,

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:32.477
when he was trying to persuade
the people from establishing a

00:30:32.477 --> 00:30:35.085
monarchy), that list of
ills--you'll have a standing

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:36.946
military,
a standing army you'll have to

00:30:36.946 --> 00:30:38.859
support, you'll have to do labor
for the state,

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:41.539
you're going to have all kinds
of taxes and special levies,

00:30:41.539 --> 00:30:44.218
you're going to be virtually
enslaved--many of these things

00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:47.419
seem to have been realized,
the Deuteronomistic historian

00:30:47.419 --> 00:30:50.529
would like us to believe,
in the reign of Solomon.

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:53.541
Moreover, as we've already
seen, the very institution of

00:30:53.541 --> 00:30:56.552
monarchy itself didn't sit well
in some quarters because

00:30:56.552 --> 00:30:59.892
centralized leadership under a
human king seemed to go against

00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:02.740
the older traditions of Hebrew
tribal society,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.041
united by covenant with God,
guided by priests,

00:31:06.041 --> 00:31:09.990
prophets, occasional judges
inspired charismatically.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:13.663
So already before Solomon's
death, the northern tribes were

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:16.829
feeling some alienation from the
house of David.

00:31:16.829 --> 00:31:20.274
They're resenting what they
perceive to be Solomon's

00:31:20.274 --> 00:31:22.211
tyranny.
So let me give you a brief

00:31:22.211 --> 00:31:25.172
timeline of what happens from
the death of Solomon down to the

00:31:25.172 --> 00:31:27.109
destruction.
And on one of the earlier

00:31:27.109 --> 00:31:29.430
handouts I gave you,
there is a list of the kings

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.314
north and south.
This is not something you need

00:31:31.314 --> 00:31:33.049
to memorize and I'm certainly
not going to stress it,

00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:37.153
but if you want to keep score,
that's a list that you can

00:31:37.153 --> 00:31:39.605
refer to.
So, when Solomon died in 922

00:31:39.605 --> 00:31:42.836
the structure that had been
erected by David and Solomon

00:31:42.836 --> 00:31:46.596
fell into these two rival states
and neither of them of course is

00:31:46.596 --> 00:31:48.299
going to be very strong.
 

00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:51.369
You have the northern kingdom
of Israel and the southern

00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:54.799
kingdom referred to as Judah,
each with its own king:

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:58.200
Jeroboam in the north,
Rehoboam in the south.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.680
Sometimes they're going to be
at war with one another,

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.630
sometimes they're going to work
in alliance with one another,

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.355
but 200 years later,
from 922 down to 722,200 years

00:32:07.355 --> 00:32:11.900
later the northern kingdom of
Israel will fall to the Assyrian

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.639
empire.
The Assyrians come down to the

00:32:14.639 --> 00:32:18.350
border of the southern kingdom,
to Judah, and Judah remains

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.230
viable but it is reduced to
vassal status.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.789
It is tributary to this new
world power.

00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:27.537
Finally, Judah will be
destroyed about 150 years later

00:32:27.537 --> 00:32:29.809
--about 587,586.
The Babylonians,

00:32:29.809 --> 00:32:32.869
the neo-Babylonian empire,
they have conquered the

00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:36.241
Assyrians and they assume
control over the ancient Near

00:32:36.241 --> 00:32:38.740
East and take the southern
kingdom.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.718
Now the story of the northern
kingdom, Israel,

00:32:41.718 --> 00:32:44.961
that is presented in Kings,
is colored by a Judean

00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:47.753
perspective,
and it is highly negative and

00:32:47.753 --> 00:32:48.829
highly polemical.
 

00:32:48.829 --> 00:32:52.859
So Solomon was succeeded by his
son, Rehoboam,

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:58.053
but the ten tribes of the north
revolted when he refused to

00:32:58.053 --> 00:33:00.650
relieve their tax burden.
 

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:02.847
They came to him and asked if
they could have some relief and

00:33:02.847 --> 00:33:05.849
he answered them very harshly,
so they revolted and a separate

00:33:05.849 --> 00:33:09.450
kingdom was set up under the
rule of the Israelite Jeroboam,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.519
just at the end of the tenth
century.

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:15.803
So divided now into these two
kingdoms, they begin to lose

00:33:15.803 --> 00:33:19.029
power, probably losing any
control they may have had over

00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:20.470
outlying territories.
 

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.700
So let's focus first on the
northern kingdom of Israel.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.618
The area was more divided by
tribal rivalries and religious

00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:29.240
traditions than Judah.
 

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.049
You have ten tribes in that
region.

00:33:31.049 --> 00:33:34.369
Jeroboam didn't seem to be able
to establish a very stable rule.

00:33:34.369 --> 00:33:38.312
1 Kings 12 tells us of
Jeroboam's effort to break the

00:33:38.312 --> 00:33:43.088
connection with the traditional
religious center of Jerusalem in

00:33:43.088 --> 00:33:45.510
the south.
He establishes his own

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.407
government at Shechem--that was
a place that was already revered

00:33:49.407 --> 00:33:50.829
in Hebrew tradition.
 

00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:53.318
This is where we have the
covenant renewal ceremony by

00:33:53.318 --> 00:33:55.619
Joshua, so it's already a
somewhat sacred site.

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:58.025
So he establishes his capital
in Shechem, and then he

00:33:58.025 --> 00:34:01.002
establishes royal shrines,
one in the southern part of

00:34:01.002 --> 00:34:03.930
Israel and one in the northern
part of Israel;

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.008
on each of the borders,
north and south of the kingdom,

00:34:07.008 --> 00:34:10.599
in Dan and Bethel (Bethel in
the south and Dan in the north).

00:34:10.599 --> 00:34:14.122
A golden calf is placed in each
shrine according to the text,

00:34:14.122 --> 00:34:17.351
and this is viewed by the
Deuteronomistic historian as a

00:34:17.351 --> 00:34:20.329
terrible sin.
Indeed the story is written in

00:34:20.329 --> 00:34:24.025
a manner that deliberately
echoes the story of the golden

00:34:24.025 --> 00:34:26.929
calf that was made by Aaron in
Exodus 32.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:31.027
There are linguistic echoes
that make it very clear that we

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:34.983
are supposed to view this as a
sin as great as the sin of

00:34:34.983 --> 00:34:37.801
Aaron.
It may well be that if Jeroboam

00:34:37.801 --> 00:34:41.751
did in fact do this that he was
a good Yahwist and was just

00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:45.565
trying to establish alternate
sanctuaries for Yahweh that

00:34:45.565 --> 00:34:47.539
would rival Jerusalem's.
 

00:34:47.539 --> 00:34:51.969
But the Deuteronomistic
historian wants to see this as

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.352
another instance of idolatry,
and therefore,

00:34:55.352 --> 00:34:58.239
deliberately echoes the
primordial cultic sin of the

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:01.409
golden calves when talking about
Jeroboam's activity.

00:35:01.409 --> 00:35:05.769
It brands his cultic center as
illegitimate idolatry.

00:35:05.769 --> 00:35:09.360
Jeroboam is represented by the
biblical writer as having made

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.010
unacceptable concessions to
Canaanite practices of worship,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:16.110
and so he is criticized for
this.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.421
Despite his best efforts,
his kingship is fairly

00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:23.860
unstable, and in fact in the
200-year history of the kingdom,

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.002
the northern kingdom of Israel,
we will have seven different

00:35:27.002 --> 00:35:28.760
dynasties occupying the throne.
 

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.051
There was great material
prosperity in the northern

00:35:32.051 --> 00:35:34.012
kingdom.
I've just picked out a few

00:35:34.012 --> 00:35:36.867
kings to highlight so these are
not to be understood to be

00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:39.765
necessarily in order,
I've just picked out a few

00:35:39.765 --> 00:35:43.613
highlights, but the rule of Omri
was a time of some material

00:35:43.613 --> 00:35:45.699
prosperity and his son,
Ahab.

00:35:45.699 --> 00:35:48.320
Ahab was the first part of the
ninth century.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.252
Omri is an interesting person
because he's the first king from

00:35:52.252 --> 00:35:56.250
either kingdom to be mentioned
in sources outside the Bible.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:59.744
We have a large stone referred
to as the Moabite Stone and in

00:35:59.744 --> 00:36:02.539
this stone, which boasts of a
military defeat,

00:36:02.539 --> 00:36:07.960
there's the boast that Omri of
Israel was defeated.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:12.006
Omri bought and fortified
Samaria as the capital of the

00:36:12.006 --> 00:36:15.646
northern kingdom of Israel,
and archaeology does reveal

00:36:15.646 --> 00:36:18.960
that this was in fact quite a
magnificent city at this time.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.892
But again the Deuteronomistic
editors are going to judge him

00:36:21.892 --> 00:36:24.110
as evil.
He's disobeyed God.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:27.150
His son, Ahab,
also comes in for bad press.

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.019
Ahab is also mentioned outside
the Bible.

00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:32.974
We have an inscription of an
Assyrian king who describes a

00:36:32.974 --> 00:36:37.068
coalition of Israelites and
Aramaeans who fought against the

00:36:37.068 --> 00:36:39.897
Assyrians,
and Ahab is mentioned in that

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:42.764
inscription.
Omri and Ahab were clearly very

00:36:42.764 --> 00:36:45.389
powerful and influential in the
region.

00:36:45.389 --> 00:36:47.449
They are even mentioned outside
the Bible.

00:36:47.449 --> 00:36:50.683
Ahab and his Phoenician wife,
Jezebel, seem to have

00:36:50.683 --> 00:36:54.434
established a very extravagant
court life in the capital of

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:56.519
Samaria,
and for this they are also

00:36:56.519 --> 00:36:59.239
going to be condemned by the
Deuteronomistic editors.

00:36:59.239 --> 00:37:03.884
Jezebel was Phoenician and when
Jezebel tried to establish the

00:37:03.884 --> 00:37:08.451
worship of her Phoenician Baal
as the official cult of Israel

00:37:08.451 --> 00:37:13.172
(she built a temple to Baal in
Samaria) the prophets Elijah and

00:37:13.172 --> 00:37:17.739
Elisha preach a kind of holy war
against the monarchy.

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:20.879
Now we're going to come back to
these very zealous Yahweh-only

00:37:20.879 --> 00:37:24.070
prophets of the north when we
talk about prophecy next time.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:28.686
Ahab and Jezebel meet a very
tragic end and there will be a

00:37:28.686 --> 00:37:32.405
military coup.
A military coup led by an army

00:37:32.405 --> 00:37:34.769
general, Jehu,
in about 842.

00:37:34.769 --> 00:37:36.667
These are all kind of
approximate years,

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:39.684
you know--different books will
give the--they'll differ by five

00:37:39.684 --> 00:37:42.263
years one way or the other but
it's our best effort at

00:37:42.263 --> 00:37:44.745
reconstructing things based on
some of these outside

00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:47.713
extra-biblical references that
give us a firm date and then we

00:37:47.713 --> 00:37:49.659
can kind of work around those.
 

00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:54.489
So the army general Jehu in
about 842 led a military coup.

00:37:54.489 --> 00:37:57.962
He was anointed king by the
prophet Elisha and he had a very

00:37:57.962 --> 00:37:59.610
bloody revenge on Jezebel.
 

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.209
Jezebel and the priests of Baal
were all slaughtered,

00:38:03.209 --> 00:38:06.255
the text says,
as well as every worshipper of

00:38:06.255 --> 00:38:09.320
Baal in Samaria;
they were all slaughtered.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:14.209
By the eighth century you have
the new Assyrian empire on the

00:38:14.209 --> 00:38:18.936
rise, and in 722 the Assyrian
king Sargon reduced Israel to

00:38:18.936 --> 00:38:21.300
the status of a province.
 

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:25.318
And we have an inscription by
Sargon that confirms the

00:38:25.318 --> 00:38:27.820
biblical report of this defeat.
 

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.183
And in this inscription Sargon
says, "" Samaria "…led away as

00:38:33.183 --> 00:38:36.730
prisoners [27,290 inhabitants of
it….

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.339
[The town I]
re better than (it was) before

00:38:39.339 --> 00:38:42.880
and therein people from
countries which myself quered."

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.429
So: population transplanting.
 

00:38:45.429 --> 00:38:48.764
"I placed an officer of mine as
governor over them and imposed

00:38:48.764 --> 00:38:51.334
upon them tribute as (is
customary) for Assyrian

00:38:51.334 --> 00:38:53.905
citizens".
So there's a basic agreement

00:38:53.905 --> 00:38:56.420
between this and the biblical
account.

00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:58.944
Many of the governing class,
the wealthy merchants,

00:38:58.944 --> 00:39:02.208
many tens of thousands in all,
were carried off to northern

00:39:02.208 --> 00:39:04.739
Mesopotamia and they were lost
to history.

00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.280
These are the ten lost tribes
of Israel.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.065
There would have remained
behind some Hebrew farmers and

00:39:10.065 --> 00:39:12.800
shepherds, they would have
continued their old ways,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.267
but as was consistent with
their policy,

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:18.873
the Assyrians imported new
peoples to repopulate this area

00:39:18.873 --> 00:39:22.226
and to break up any local
resistance to their rule and

00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:25.579
this would then become the
province of Samaria.

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:29.422
And this ethnically mixed group
would practice a form of

00:39:29.422 --> 00:39:32.693
Israelite religion,
but the Deuteronomistic editor

00:39:32.693 --> 00:39:36.361
does not view it as legitimate
and ultimately these Samaritans

00:39:36.361 --> 00:39:40.270
were going to be despised by the
Jews of the southern kingdom,

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.650
the Jews of Judah.
 

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.800
They were seen as foreign
corruptors of the faith.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.576
They were always ready to
assist Judah's enemies against

00:39:46.576 --> 00:39:49.453
Judah, so they felt very little
kinship and very often the

00:39:49.453 --> 00:39:52.889
Samaritans would join against,
those attacking Judah.

00:39:52.889 --> 00:39:56.778
So there was tremendous rivalry
between the Jews of Judah and

00:39:56.778 --> 00:40:00.013
the Samaritans.
Hence, the New Testament story

00:40:00.013 --> 00:40:04.210
makes sense--this was a hated
person, this good Samaritan.

00:40:04.210 --> 00:40:08.803
So if we turn our attention now
to the southern kingdom of

00:40:08.803 --> 00:40:13.316
Judah: Judah was comprised of
the two remaining tribes of

00:40:13.316 --> 00:40:16.563
Judah and Benjamin,
and it enjoyed internal

00:40:16.563 --> 00:40:18.320
stability for the most part.
 

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.269
It remained loyal to the house
of David ruling in Jerusalem.

00:40:22.269 --> 00:40:26.530
Shortly after Israel fell in
722 to the Assyrians,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:31.659
the Judahites--whose king at
that time was King Hezekiah,

00:40:31.659 --> 00:40:35.550
so the king Hezekiah had to
agree to terms with Assyria.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:38.719
They became subject allies or
vassals of Assyria.

00:40:38.719 --> 00:40:41.566
But Hezekiah began to prepare
for rebellion,

00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:45.471
began to make alliances with
neighbors and this prompted the

00:40:45.471 --> 00:40:48.980
Assyrians to march in and lay
siege to Jerusalem.

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.838
This would have happened about
701, and this siege is described

00:40:53.838 --> 00:40:57.755
in Assyrian sources,
so we have independent records

00:40:57.755 --> 00:41:00.420
of this from Assyrian sources.
 

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.013
We read there:
"As to Hezekiah,

00:41:03.013 --> 00:41:05.519
the Jew,"--of Yehud,
right?

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:09.461
the Jew--"he did not submit to
my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of

00:41:09.461 --> 00:41:12.090
his strong cities,
walled forts," etc.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.989
"I drove out…200,150
people….

00:41:14.989 --> 00:41:18.876
Himself I made prisoner in
Jerusalem, his royal residence,

00:41:18.876 --> 00:41:20.650
like a bird in a cage" .
 

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.889
But eventually the Assyrians
actually withdrew the siege,

00:41:23.889 --> 00:41:27.128
Judah was able to withstand the
siege, preserve their own

00:41:27.128 --> 00:41:29.561
kingship.
The Assyrian empire is going to

00:41:29.561 --> 00:41:33.034
fall in 612--this is the fall of
Nineveh you may have heard of at

00:41:33.034 --> 00:41:36.290
some point--and they will fall
to the rising Babylonians,

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.219
the neo-Babylonian empire.
 

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:42.849
It's the neo-Babylonian empire
that will succeed in felling

00:41:42.849 --> 00:41:47.159
Judah under Nebuchadrezzar of
Babylon in 587 or 586.

00:41:47.159 --> 00:41:50.319
The walls of Jerusalem are
dismantled, many members of the

00:41:50.319 --> 00:41:52.315
governing classes,
wealthier classes,

00:41:52.315 --> 00:41:55.420
are going to be carried off
into exile in Babylonia.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.165
And that the Hebrews didn't
fade into oblivion after the

00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:03.320
loss of political independence
and their geographical base,

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.194
is due in large part to the
interpretation of events

00:42:07.194 --> 00:42:10.309
provided by the Deuteronomistic
school.

00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:13.945
So we need to talk a little bit
about that ideology and why it

00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.329
had the historical effect that
it had.

00:42:16.329 --> 00:42:19.039
As I mentioned before,
Deuteronomy isn't just the

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:22.314
capstone of the Pentateuch's
narrative, it's also the first

00:42:22.314 --> 00:42:24.460
part of a longer literary
history.

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.214
Martin Noth was the German
scholar who first argued for

00:42:28.214 --> 00:42:31.691
this, argued that the
composition and authorship of

00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:35.933
Deuteronomy has more in common
with what follows in some sense

00:42:35.933 --> 00:42:37.880
than what precedes it.
 

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.609
And he argued that we should
understand this to be a unit,

00:42:41.609 --> 00:42:44.030
the product of a particular
School.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:48.489
Since this Deuteronomistic
School is looking back at the

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:53.111
history of Israel up to and
including the defeat and exile

00:42:53.111 --> 00:42:57.922
of the Israelites in 587 or 586,
the final form of the work of

00:42:57.922 --> 00:43:02.099
the Deuteronomistic School--the
final form must be post exilic.

00:43:02.099 --> 00:43:05.098
It's post-586,
but there are of course various

00:43:05.098 --> 00:43:09.097
layers within that larger work
that we can't really date with

00:43:09.097 --> 00:43:11.837
precision.
I just want to say something

00:43:11.837 --> 00:43:15.839
about the scholarly methodology
that led to the conclusion that

00:43:15.839 --> 00:43:19.260
there is such a thing as a
Deuteronomistic School.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:22.329
That method is redaction
criticism.

00:43:22.329 --> 00:43:25.911
And we've already discussed the
goals and the methods of other

00:43:25.911 --> 00:43:28.788
types of criticism:
source criticism or historical

00:43:28.788 --> 00:43:31.347
criticism.
We've talked a little bit about

00:43:31.347 --> 00:43:33.590
form criticism and tradition
criticism.

00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.906
But redaction criticism grew
out of a kind of weariness with

00:43:37.906 --> 00:43:42.003
some of these other forms of
biblical criticism and their

00:43:42.003 --> 00:43:46.466
constant fragmentation of the
biblical text into older sources

00:43:46.466 --> 00:43:50.489
or into older genres or into
older units of tradition in

00:43:50.489 --> 00:43:54.659
order to map out a history of
Israelite religion.

00:43:54.659 --> 00:43:58.509
These other methods seem to pay
very little attention to the

00:43:58.509 --> 00:44:02.098
text in its final form and the
process by which the text

00:44:02.098 --> 00:44:03.860
reached its final form.
 

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:08.463
So redaction criticism rejects
the idea that the person or the

00:44:08.463 --> 00:44:12.613
persons who compiled the text
from earlier sources did a

00:44:12.613 --> 00:44:16.159
somewhat mechanical scissors and
paste job,

00:44:16.159 --> 00:44:19.053
didn't really think too much
about the effect they were

00:44:19.053 --> 00:44:21.090
creating by putting things
together.

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:25.672
Redaction criticism assumes and
focuses on identifying the

00:44:25.672 --> 00:44:30.335
purpose and the plan behind the
final form of the assembled

00:44:30.335 --> 00:44:32.582
sources.
It's a method that wants to

00:44:32.582 --> 00:44:35.098
uncover the intention of the
person or the persons who

00:44:35.098 --> 00:44:37.900
produced the biblical text in
roughly the shape that we have

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.097
it,
and what was intended by their

00:44:40.097 --> 00:44:42.519
producing it in the shape that
we have.

00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:45.639
So redaction criticism proceeds
along these lines and this is

00:44:45.639 --> 00:44:46.940
how it first developed.
 

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:49.799
First you can usually identify
linking passages,

00:44:49.799 --> 00:44:53.024
that is to say passages that
kind of join narrative to

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.583
narrative or unit to unit,
in an attempt to make the text

00:44:56.583 --> 00:44:59.876
read more smoothly or just to
ease the transition from one

00:44:59.876 --> 00:45:01.090
source to another.
 

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:06.079
And these linking passages are
assigned to R for redactor.

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:10.510
Also assigned to R are any
interpretative passages.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.993
That means passages that stand
back to comment on the text or

00:45:13.993 --> 00:45:15.909
interpret the text in some way.
 

00:45:15.909 --> 00:45:20.377
Any place where the narrator
turns to directly address the

00:45:20.377 --> 00:45:22.125
audience.
So for example,

00:45:22.125 --> 00:45:25.547
when you have a verse in which
the narrator turns and says,

00:45:25.547 --> 00:45:28.909
"That was when the Canaanites
were still in the land,"

00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:31.841
that would seem to be from the
hand of a redactor putting the

00:45:31.841 --> 00:45:32.769
sources together.
 

00:45:32.769 --> 00:45:35.851
When you have an etiological
comment, that is to say a

00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:38.816
comment of the type,
"And that is why the Israelites

00:45:38.816 --> 00:45:41.840
do such and such ritual
observance to this day,"

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:45.577
that also seems to be written
from the perspective of a

00:45:45.577 --> 00:45:48.577
compiler of sources,
someone who's putting the text

00:45:48.577 --> 00:45:51.121
together.
There are also some passages

00:45:51.121 --> 00:45:55.151
that vindicate or justify or
otherwise comment on what's

00:45:55.151 --> 00:45:58.230
about to occur,
or passages that summarize and

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:01.515
offer an interpretation or
justification of what has just

00:46:01.515 --> 00:46:04.570
happened.
We'll see that in 2 Kings 17;

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.809
we also saw that in the Book of
Judges.

00:46:06.809 --> 00:46:09.399
We had this prospective summary
saying: this is what's going to

00:46:09.399 --> 00:46:12.000
happen--there's going to be sin,
they're going to cry out,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.840
there'll be,
you know, God will raise up

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.121
someone,
they'll deliver them and then

00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:16.250
they're going to fall back into
sin again.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:20.037
So these are comments that are
looking forward to tell us what

00:46:20.037 --> 00:46:23.637
it is we're about to read and if
you join all such passages

00:46:23.637 --> 00:46:27.300
together and assign them to R
you very often find that there

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.150
are tremendous stylistic
similarities in these passages.

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.429
They use the same rhetoric over
and over again or you'll see the

00:46:34.429 --> 00:46:37.760
same point of view and it's very
often a point of view that isn't

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.780
in the source materials that
they're linking together.

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.780
And this is how one arrives at
some understanding of the role

00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.480
of the redactor in the final
production of the text,

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.532
how the redactor has framed our
understanding of the source

00:46:49.532 --> 00:46:51.269
materials that he has gathered.
 

00:46:51.269 --> 00:46:54.199
And the Deuteronomistic
historian who is responsible for

00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:57.158
the redaction of Deuteronomy,
Joshua, Judges and so,

00:46:57.158 --> 00:47:00.249
1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2
Kings, provides not just a

00:47:00.249 --> 00:47:03.520
history in the sense of
documenting events as they occur

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.898
(as if there's ever
documentation without

00:47:05.898 --> 00:47:09.109
interpretation) but provides a
strong interpretation of

00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:11.500
history,
a philosophy of history.

00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:14.392
He's trying to ascertain the
meaning of events,

00:47:14.392 --> 00:47:17.788
the larger purpose and design,
something we've called a

00:47:17.788 --> 00:47:20.555
historiosophy.
And we find the Deuteronomists'

00:47:20.555 --> 00:47:23.456
interpretation of Israel's
history in the preface to the

00:47:23.456 --> 00:47:26.001
Book of Deuteronomy,
we find it in editorial

00:47:26.001 --> 00:47:28.955
comments that are sort of
peppered throughout Joshua

00:47:28.955 --> 00:47:32.198
through Kings,
and we especially find it in

00:47:32.198 --> 00:47:37.360
the summary of the entire unit
that is contained in 2 Kings 17.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.004
Before we read that passage we
need to think about what it was

00:47:41.004 --> 00:47:44.112
that prompted the Deuteronomist
to adopt a particular

00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:47.039
interpretation of Israel's
historical record.

00:47:47.039 --> 00:47:50.735
The Deuteronomistic historian
was attempting to respond to the

00:47:50.735 --> 00:47:54.613
first major historical challenge
to confront the Israelite people

00:47:54.613 --> 00:47:56.309
and the Hebrew religion.
 

00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:59.031
And that was the complete
collapse of the Israelite

00:47:59.031 --> 00:48:01.480
nation, the destruction of God's
sanctuary,

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.817
and the defeat and exile of the
people of the Lord and God of

00:48:05.817 --> 00:48:08.965
history.
The calamitous events of 722,

00:48:08.965 --> 00:48:12.980
but especially 587,
raised a critical theological

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.474
dilemma.
God had promised the patriarchs

00:48:15.474 --> 00:48:18.320
and their descendants that they
would live in His land.

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:21.343
He had promised that the house
of David would stand forever but

00:48:21.343 --> 00:48:24.268
here the monarchy had collapsed,
the people were defeated and

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:25.389
they were in exile.
 

00:48:25.389 --> 00:48:29.162
So the challenge presented by
this twist of history was really

00:48:29.162 --> 00:48:31.449
twofold: Is God the god of
history,

00:48:31.449 --> 00:48:33.762
is he omnipotent,
is he capable of all,

00:48:33.762 --> 00:48:36.440
can he in fact impose and
effect His will,

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.475
and if so then what about his
covenant with the patriarchs and

00:48:39.475 --> 00:48:40.770
his covenant with David?
 

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:42.880
Had he faithlessly abandoned it?
 

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.190
Well, that was unthinkable.
 

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:49.143
Then if he hadn't faithlessly
abandoned his covenant with his

00:48:49.143 --> 00:48:52.240
people and with David,
he must not be the god of

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.809
history, the universal lord of
all.

00:48:54.809 --> 00:48:56.840
He wasn't able to save his
people.

00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.805
Neither of these ideas was
acceptable to the

00:48:59.805 --> 00:49:01.530
Deuteronomistic school.
 

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:05.034
It was a fundamental tenet of
Israelite monotheism that God is

00:49:05.034 --> 00:49:07.694
at once the god of history,
capable of all,

00:49:07.694 --> 00:49:11.210
whose will is absolute,
whose promises are true and at

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.328
the same time a god of
faithfulness who does not

00:49:14.328 --> 00:49:18.760
abandon his people,
he is both good and powerful.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.198
So how could the disasters of
722 and 586 be reconciled with

00:49:22.198 --> 00:49:25.288
the conviction that God
controlled history and that He

00:49:25.288 --> 00:49:28.960
had an eternal covenant with the
patriarchs and with David?

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:32.940
The historiosophy of the
Deuteronomistic school is the

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.920
response of one segment of the
Israelite community,

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.341
we'll see another response when
we turn to the Prophets,

00:49:40.341 --> 00:49:43.762
but the basic idea of the
Deuteronomistic School is that

00:49:43.762 --> 00:49:47.494
God's unconditional and eternal
covenants with the patriarchs

00:49:47.494 --> 00:49:51.350
and with David do not preclude
the possibility of punishment or

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.522
chastisement for sin as
specified in the conditional

00:49:54.522 --> 00:49:57.527
Mosaic covenant.
So you see how both ideas are

00:49:57.527 --> 00:49:59.920
going to be important to hold in
dialectic tension:

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.339
both theologies,
the covenant theology as well

00:50:02.339 --> 00:50:04.369
as the patriarchal and royal
theology.

00:50:04.369 --> 00:50:06.543
So this is because although God
is omnipotent,

00:50:06.543 --> 00:50:09.055
humans do have free will,
they can corrupt the divine

00:50:09.055 --> 00:50:10.914
plan.
So in the Deuteronomistic

00:50:10.914 --> 00:50:14.048
history the leaders of Israel
are depicted as having the

00:50:14.048 --> 00:50:16.840
choice of accepting God's way or
rejecting it.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.079
God tries to help them.
 

00:50:18.079 --> 00:50:20.770
He's constantly sending them
prophets who yell at the kings

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.719
and tell them what it is God
wants of them,

00:50:22.719 --> 00:50:24.900
but they continue to make the
wrong choice.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.907
They sin and ultimately that
brings about the fall,

00:50:27.907 --> 00:50:31.275
first of Israel and then of
Judah and it's the idolatrous

00:50:31.275 --> 00:50:33.380
sins of the kings that does it.
 

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:37.073
With the deposition and the
execution of the last Davidic

00:50:37.073 --> 00:50:39.777
king, Zedekiah,
the Deuteronomistic school

00:50:39.777 --> 00:50:43.536
reinterpreted the Davidic
Covenant in conditional terms on

00:50:43.536 --> 00:50:46.239
the model of the Sinaitic
Covenant,

00:50:46.239 --> 00:50:49.501
the Mosaic Covenant,
according to which God's favor

00:50:49.501 --> 00:50:53.090
toward the king depends on the
king's loyalty to God,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:56.628
and in this way the fall of the
house of David could be seen as

00:50:56.628 --> 00:50:59.938
justifiable punishment for
disobedient kings or rulers like

00:50:59.938 --> 00:51:02.210
Manasseh.
(We'll come back to him.)

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.638
Remember the Davidic Covenant
that Nathan proclaimed in 2

00:51:05.638 --> 00:51:09.188
Samuel 7 explicitly said that
God would punish and chastise

00:51:09.188 --> 00:51:11.959
his anointed.
That's what it means to be a

00:51:11.959 --> 00:51:15.239
son, to receive correction,
discipline and punishment.

00:51:15.239 --> 00:51:18.637
I'll have to finish this these
thoughts on Monday and see

00:51:18.637 --> 00:51:22.277
specifically how they interpret
and understand the history of

00:51:22.277 --> 00:51:25.795
what happened in a way that
enabled certain segments of the

00:51:25.795 --> 00:51:29.436
population to see this as in
fact proof of God's strength and

00:51:29.436 --> 00:51:33.138
faithfulness.
And then we'll turn to prophecy

00:51:33.138 --> 00:51:34.000
on Monday.

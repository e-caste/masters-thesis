00:00:00.194 --> 00:00:02.861
(ambient music)

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.650
- Okay. Greetings everyone.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.070
Thank you for joining
me on this beautiful day

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.690
when there are so many lovely things

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.540
that you could be doing outside.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.100
Where did the picnic tables come from?

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.450
What's up with the picnic tables?

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.890
Where do those.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.653
- [Student] Morse College was closed.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.964
So commons went sideways.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.797
- Okay.

00:00:33.188 --> 00:00:34.790
Okay, okay.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.907
- [Student] It went this way.

00:00:35.907 --> 00:00:37.383
- Okay.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.690
Right. Class.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.720
So, again, I would take you guys outside

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.120
if it weren't for the fact
that there's this technology

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.173
which is keeping me fixed right here.

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.650
The way that I wanna talk
about the subject today

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.510
is to broaden it a bit

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.780
and think about the German factor

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.660
in Ukrainian political history.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.660
Because the German factor has
a kind of strange shape to it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.350
where actually Germany, German culture,

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.200
the German language doesn't mean very much

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.880
in Ukrainian history

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.070
until quite late in the day,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.130
until the 19th and
especially the 20th century.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.920
And then suddenly it means quite a lot

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.630
and most of it quite negative.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.730
Most of it quite destructive.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.950
So, I wanted to start by just

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.630
going back over a few of the
themes from previous lectures

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.190
just to set the stage for
this kind of sudden on rush

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.680
of Germany in Ukrainian history.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
Because I have this,

00:01:44.513 --> 00:01:49.147
I have the feeling that if I
just start with 1939 or 1941

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.740
in a way that will be too abrupt

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.400
and we won't understand
the depth of the contrast.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160
'Cause something new really
begins in the 20th century.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.993
There isn't...

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:02.610
When Germany begins to contact Ukraine,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.930
something new happens

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.270
and to see the novelty I think
we have to start earlier on.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.320
So, I'm just gonna now
just do a real quick

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.990
series of stopping points

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.390
along the previous several centuries.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.647
Oh, sorry, the other thing
I wanna tell you guys

00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:18.630
in case you haven't figured
it out is I have a cold,

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.670
so I'm at like 85%.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.440
So hopefully I'll go at 85% speed

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.490
and that will be more appropriate

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.890
and everybody will be happy.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.170
I always feel stupid
when it's nice outside

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.562
and I have a cold, right?

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:30.395
(students laughing)

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:31.440
You know what I mean?

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.800
I don't feel stupid when it's
like January and I feel great

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.750
but when it's like, anyway.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.300
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna review

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.340
the last six or seven centuries

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.410
and just remind us of some
of the stopping points

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.820
that we've marked.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820
One of them is the Holy Roman Empire.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.740
So if you think back to
the beginning of the class

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.910
and the conjuncture in which
the Kyivan state is formed,

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.460
Christianity is coming
from two directions,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.040
from the west and from the south,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.350
from the Holy Roman
Empire and from Byzantium.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.330
And roughly speaking,
all of the new states

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.190
that are formed then are either

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.890
in a relationship to the
Holy Roman Empire like Poland

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.600
because Western Christian

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.810
or to the Byzantium
because Eastern Christian

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.760
or what we're later gonna call orthodoxy.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.880
So, that rivalry, the
presence of Holy Roman Empire

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.360
does have something to do with our story.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.360
And that rivalry generated
this contest for Moravia

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.990
back in the eighth century
where those gentlemen,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.680
Cyril and Methodius made that
trip northwards to Moravia

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.940
and they brought the language with them.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.050
They brought the language with them

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.700
which we call Old Church Slavonic.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.370
And they were the ones
who created an alphabet

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.990
for Slavic languages.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.740
That has to do with the
German factor in some sense

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.250
because it's this contest

00:03:52.218 --> 00:03:54.780
between Western and Eastern Christianity,

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.250
the friction between them,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.660
which forces people to be creative

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.980
and come up with new solutions

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.690
like for example, Church Slavonic,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.490
like the Cyrillic language which comes,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.400
the Cyrillic alphabet
which comes a bit later.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.500
It's a bit of a stretch
but I hope you'll buy it

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.340
if I say that the Viking factor is also

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.250
in some way the Germanic world.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.790
So the Scandinavian languages,

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.170
except for Finnish of course,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.200
the Scandinavian languages
are Germanic languages.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.500
And so Kyivan Rus' is
in some way connected

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.190
to a broadly speaking Germanic
world by way of Scandinavia,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.510
by way of the Vikings,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.770
by way of the Viking contact

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.870
which begins eighth
century, ninth century,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.210
and has to do with the creation of a state

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.240
in the 10th and especially
in the 11th century.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.510
And so you can think of
Ukraine as being part of

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.300
a kind of crescent of Scandinavian

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.360
or Viking state building attempts

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.780
which ranges from England
through Scandinavia itself,

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.853
and then all the way down to Kyiv.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.630
The next moment which I
didn't really bring out

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.490
is the Reformation.

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.300
So, the Reformation is largely a German

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.660
and then Swiss and then
French event at the beginning.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.620
The Reformation, the emergence
of versions of Christianity

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:08.970
is relevant to Ukraine,

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.170
is relevant to our story

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.970
because it is that friction between

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.860
Protestantism and Catholicism.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.900
The Reformation in later the Catholic,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.390
in later Counter-Reformation,
the Catholic Reformation,

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.830
which forces our churchmen in
places like Chernihiv in Kyiv

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.110
to take up many languages,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.730
to take up the Renaissance,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.740
to take up Disputation, right?

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.920
It is those things which
make those churchmen

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.400
in Kyiv, Chernihiv different, for example,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.410
than Churchmen in Moscow

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.450
who don't have contact
with the Reformation,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.550
don't have contact with the Renaissance.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.440
And will eventually have
contact with those things

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.503
but by way of Kyiv itself.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.750
It's also interesting in that
Protestantism and Orthodoxy

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.120
sometimes formed a kind of alliance,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.250
at least a kind of
brief practical alliance

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.490
where the Orthodox would
borrow arguments from the,

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.570
the Orthodox would borrow arguments

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.472
from the Protestants
against the Catholics.

00:06:03.472 --> 00:06:05.730
So there was some kind
of cross-fertilization

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.170
and there were also very,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.670
there were some very
important Ukrainian families,

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.810
families of Ukrainian magnates,

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.430
wealthy magnates from old Rus

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.290
who converted to Protestantism.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.450
But in general, that only
lasted for one generation

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.450
and the next generation they
converted to Catholicism,

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.080
and then are remembered
as Polish families.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.740
So, that's interesting.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.670
I hope you agree

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.420
but it's relatively meager.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.810
The connection if we compare
it to the connection with

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.020
the Grand Duchy of Lithuania
or with Poland, right,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.370
or with Byzantium,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.400
the connection with
Germany is fairly meager

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.710
until we get into the modern period,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.470
the modern period of the nation state.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.460
And it's here where Germany
starts to become very important

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.530
because Germany's not the most imperial,

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.020
most important imperial power in Europe.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.190
Never, right?

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.130
Germany, this is a key fact about Germany.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.860
Here come your five minutes
of modern German history.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:09.120
A key fact about Germany
is that it comes into being

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.930
after the world has been colonized.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.060
And this is something that
the Germans themselves

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.370
are very aware of.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.910
The German unification of January 1871

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.370
takes place at a time when
almost all of the world

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:25.800
that's going to be colonized
is already colonized

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.780
from the European point of view.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.010
There are a couple of more decades

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.170
of the Race for Africa
that Germany takes part in.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:34.710
It has colonies in Southeastern
and Southwestern Africa.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.220
But in general, the world has already been

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.900
divided up by the time that
Germany becomes a state

00:07:41.974 --> 00:07:43.620
in the late 19th century.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.290
So you remember some points on
the basic trajectory of this

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.960
that Germany is unified not from Vienna,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.233
not from our Hapsburg
friends, but by Prussia.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.440
I've been trying to
kinda note along the way

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.510
in each lecture when Prussia turns up

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.450
because eventually Prussia
is going to be important.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:07.650
The Ducal Prussia breaks
free of Poland in 1657

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.360
during a difficult time for Poland,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.790
a few years after the
Cossacks have rebelled

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.770
that Prussia declares itself
to be a kingdom in 1701.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.750
And then you may, you remember this fellow

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.460
Frederick the Great of Prussia

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.860
who's ruling from 1740 to 1780,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.650
he turned up in our class as the rival

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.720
of Maria Theresa of Hapsburg,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.370
when Maria Theresa of Hapsburg

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.430
becomes the first female
ruler of the Hapsburgs.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.600
He challenges her,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.433
he declares war.

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:35.640
They come to power about the same time,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.610
he immediately declares war as one does

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.360
on the logic that he's just
protecting her as one says.

00:08:44.551 --> 00:08:48.060
And that period of Prussian history

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:51.150
is the moment when Prussia
begins to gather in

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:54.153
other important lands such as Silesia.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.380
This moment in Prussian history is also,

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.820
if I can just make a brief connection

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.050
to the history of philosophy,

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.710
this is also the moment of
the great German philosopher

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.000
Immanuel Kant,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.250
who you just might have
heard of in some other class,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.090
the foundational philosopher
of ethics and many other things

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.443
at least in the western
tradition in the modern period.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.530
Kant is the fellow who argued

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.150
among many other interesting things

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.150
that when you act,

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.510
you should act as though
you were making a rule.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.190
So that as though everything you do,

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.890
you should be able to categorize
and think of it as a rule.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.400
So for example, for example,

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.290
if you're watching this
class not live but on video

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.760
and there are 3 million
views of this class,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:49.170
and every single person who
watches it sends me an email

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.943
and expects me to respond,

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.750
the rule that you are creating is that

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.080
Timothy Snyder should spend 60 years

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.970
responding to your emails.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.777
I've done the math.

00:10:01.777 --> 00:10:03.750
(students laugh)

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.180
So that's an example of Kantian reasoning.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.560
If you think it would be a good world

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.290
in which Timothy Snyder spent
no time with his children,

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.180
didn't sleep, didn't eat,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:13.563
did no research,

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.723
but responded to emails
for the next 60 years,

00:10:17.723 --> 00:10:20.070
then what you should do individually

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.610
is write me an email and
expect me to respond.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.700
I say that with a smile, I
appreciate your nice emails,

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.853
but just think about the rule
that it would be created.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.570
So then to think of a different rule.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.540
If every time someone watched
a video from this class,

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.950
they made a donation to Razom, R-A-Z-O-M,

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.080
you would be creating
a rule that Ukrainians

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.540
should get warm clothing over the winter.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.680
Or if every time you watched
a video of this class,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.760
you went to my United24
site and made a donation,

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.960
you'd be making a rule

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.320
that Ukrainians can protect
themselves from drones.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.930
So there are lots of rules
that you can make, right?

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.250
It's up to you.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.626
Okay. That was Kant.

00:11:04.626 --> 00:11:06.630
(students laughing)

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.503
That was Kant.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.100
So even those of you haven't
taken intellectual history

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:13.050
are now gonna remember Kant

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:15.480
and acting as though all of
your actions create a rule.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.313
Okay.

00:11:16.313 --> 00:11:19.050
So Kant is the great
18th century philosopher,

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.620
So you'll remember that the
Prussians and the Hapsburgs

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.680
are rivals for the
unification of Germany, right?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.150
They're rivals for the
unification of Germany

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:29.580
and it's the Prussians,
surprisingly, who win.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.310
They beat the Hapsburgs
in the war in 1866.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.000
They unified Germany then
they beat the French in 1870,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.450
and then they unified Germany

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.890
at the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.240
They sign a treaty unified
Germany in January of 1871.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.460
So that's where Germany comes into being.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.500
But even in those decades,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.340
it's less Germany and
more the Hapsburg monarchy

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.410
that matters for Ukraine, right?

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.650
Insofar as there's a German
factor in Ukrainian history

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.220
in the 1870s, 1880s, 1890s, 1900s,

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.390
it's the one that we studied

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.640
under the rubric of the Hapsburgs.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.380
When the German language comes into

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.760
what's now Western Ukraine,

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.700
it's by way of the Hapsburgs.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.940
When the idea of enlightenment comes in,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.090
it's by way of the Hapsburgs, precisely.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.070
I say I warm you all up with this

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.390
just because I want you to see

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:26.390
how drastic the change is in
the 20th century when it comes.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.730
In the First World War,
as we've already seen,

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:33.750
there is a moment when Germany
controls most of Ukraine.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.253
There's a moment in 19,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.050
from early 1918 to the middle of 1918

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:42.600
when Germany and the Hapsburgs together

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.980
control most of Ukraine,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.723
occupy most of Ukraine.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.530
Theoretically, what they are doing

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:51.303
is national self-determination.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.500
So this whole, this national
self-determination business

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.060
as you know and as
you've seen in this class

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:58.890
can work out in lots of different ways.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.500
The German version of national
self-determination was

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.390
we are going to recognize you.

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.700
No one else is going to
recognize you but we will.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.670
And in exchange we want you
to deliver X million amount,

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.290
X million tons of grain.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:12.750
And then in practice
that grain was very often

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.630
forcibly requisitioned
from Ukrainian peasants

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:19.080
who very successfully
resisted those requisitions.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.610
So, what the Germans were
after and the Austrians too

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.060
was food from Ukraine in 1918

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.560
which would allow them to
win the First World War.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.180
That's very crucial to the First World War

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.020
and what comes next.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.550
It's not the kind of thing which we,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.130
if you're studying the war
from a British or French

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:39.900
or American point of view
you're gonna be thinking about

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.190
Ukraine and the food

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:43.140
and that the Germans might win in 1918.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.780
But from the point of view of
Central and Eastern Europe,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.680
this idea that Ukraine was a
(speaks in foreign language),

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:52.080
that Ukraine was like an endless

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.790
chamber filled with food, right?

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.340
Like it was a barn, a cornucopia.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.350
It was an endless supply of food.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.320
That notion is very important, right?

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.820
Because the idea that a land
is not about its people,

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.430
but it's about all the things
you can extract from it

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.760
is a very attractive colonial idea.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.730
And that idea is only
going to be intensified

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.980
in the mind of a German soldier

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.820
who served not on the Eastern
but on the western front,

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:23.550
and that would be Adolf Hitler.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.780
So, the way that Adolf
Hitler thinks about Ukraine

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.760
becomes intensely important
in 1941, '42, 1943

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.840
because that's when
Germany's going to invade

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.180
the Eastern Europe again.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.510
I wanna step back here and
try to give you a portrait

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.630
of how Hitler saw Ukraine

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.330
and how he came to power and then what,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.870
then we'll see what the
Germans actually did.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.970
So there is one way in which

00:14:56.970 --> 00:14:59.310
what happens in the east affects Hitler.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.140
He's not a soldier in the east

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.880
but he does have this general idea

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.170
that German soldiers generally have

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.730
which was that we didn't
lose the war in the east

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:06.630
which they didn't.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.940
They didn't lose the war in the east.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.590
What happened in the east?

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.400
Well, the version of what
happened in the east that they get

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.883
is very often coming from
refugees coming from the east.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.110
So namely from the people
we call white Russians

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.420
which is kind of an unfortunate
name in a number of ways

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.820
but by white Russian what is meant are

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:27.810
the people who are fighting

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.840
for the restoration of
the empire and lost.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.840
And so now many of them end
up in France or in Germany.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.920
And some of these white Russian emigres

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.170
bring with them an interesting idea about,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.550
interesting for Hitler I mean,

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:45.750
interesting idea about
Bolshevism, about communism,

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.360
which is that it is all a Jewish plot.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.360
So this for Hitler and for
the development of German

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.750
extreme right ideology
is a very important piece

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.070
of what turns out to be
Hitler's coherent worldview.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.200
Up until that time,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.300
Hitler had been saying that the Jews

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.210
were responsible for capitalism, right?

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.583
That capitalism was a Jewish conspiracy.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:17.580
After 1919 or so, he begins also to say

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.723
that the Jews are
responsible for communism.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.550
And the reason and so then this
is sort of an old punchline,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:29.310
like how can they be both the
capitalist and the communists?

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.200
But from Hitler's point of view,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.290
this isn't actually contradictory at all

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:38.340
because what Hitler argues
in his book "Mein Kampf"

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:43.140
is that the Jews are
responsible for all ideas

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.820
which allow humans to regard
one another as humans.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:52.530
And so, capitalism with its
social contract and so on,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:54.060
capitalism with its contracts,

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.520
capitalism with its legal
recognition and so on

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.283
is one way that we see each
other in non-racial terms.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.940
Likewise, communism with
its class solidarity

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:07.840
and its idea of revolution and so on

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.630
is a way of seeing ourselves
in non-racial terms.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.680
For Hitler, any way of seeing
ourselves in non-racial terms

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.820
is Jewish and anti-human and anti natural.

00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:23.700
So the Jews are responsible
also for Christianity.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.580
I mean, you can multiply,

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.380
I mean there may be a stronger
argument there actually

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.200
but you can multiply the list of things

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.250
that Jews are responsible for.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.960
They're responsible in Hitler's mind

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.960
for any notion which sets us
apart from racial competition.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.270
Because for Hitler, and
this is a crucial thing,

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:44.400
the racial competition is nature.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.410
That's the way we're supposed to be.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.820
We are divided up into races,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:48.960
races are like species.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.010
They shouldn't be interbreeding,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.960
they should just be starving
one another to death.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.490
That is good, that's natural.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:55.590
That's the way nature is supposed to work.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.630
That's what the future's
going to look like.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:01.230
And that's going to be
as good as things get.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:03.630
So, how does this lead to Ukraine?

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.610
Oh, so just to make this clear,

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:08.700
this is why Hitler's
antisemitism is so intense

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.250
because what he's saying
about the Jews is not,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:12.083
as you sometimes read,

00:18:12.083 --> 00:18:14.100
he's not saying they're
like racially inferior

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.000
or anything like that.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.800
What he is saying is that the Jews

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:21.510
have a kind of supernatural
power to turn the humans

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:25.650
into non-racial brain slaves basically

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.510
with their communism,
with their capitalism,

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.490
with their Christianity,
with whatever it might be.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:32.220
They come and they take the healthy humans

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.130
who should be engaged in
racial combat the entire time

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:36.600
'cause that's what they're
supposed to be doing,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.560
that's what nature says,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.080
and turn them into beings who are capable

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.943
of conversation and so on, right?

00:18:43.344 --> 00:18:45.120
So, the Jews have spoiled nature.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.740
He's very clear about this.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.450
And what follows from
that is that the Jews

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.280
then have to be removed from the planet

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:51.663
one way or another, right?

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.020
They rule by way of ideas

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.320
and you can't extract the
ideas from everyone's mind

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:59.970
without physically
getting rid of the Jews.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:01.620
All this logic is entirely clear

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.900
and explicit in "Mein Kampf."

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.850
What does it have to do with Ukraine?

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:08.100
Has a lot to do with Ukraine.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:13.100
Because the racial element
of all this leads to Ukraine.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:14.970
From Hitler's point of view,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.027
Ukraine is Lebensraum

00:19:18.027 --> 00:19:19.920
Like Lebensraum is
one of these German words

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.510
that you have to know.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:25.770
It just means living
space or habitat, right?

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:30.240
So, in ecological context
it would just mean habitat.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.540
So Lebensraum means
like, oh, or ecological niche.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.130
Like it's where a species,

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.410
or in Hitler's mind, a race belongs.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.243
Living space.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:40.620
It literally means living
space, space for life.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.590
Ukraine is the best Lebensraum

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.110
because it has the most
fertile territory, right?

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.720
It has the most productive
agricultural soil,

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.920
the black earth.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.620
And therefore the Germans should be there

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.870
because the Germans are the superior race.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.880
And if the Germans are not there,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.490
then that requires some explanation

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:01.710
which appeals to the Jewish factor, right?

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.870
So the reason the Germans are not there,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.970
the reason we lost the First
World War, for example,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.620
is that there was a Jewish conspiracy,

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.110
the Jews stabbed us in
the back behind the lines.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.670
Whatever it might be, right?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.100
The Jews were behind the
British and their blockade.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:14.940
Whatever it might be.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.650
If the Germans have not achieved

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.730
what they should be achieving,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.280
it must be the fault of the Jews.

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.760
So the idea of (speaking German)
leads directly to Ukraine.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.950
Hitler's notion is that
Germany's gonna become

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.070
a large empire or a frontier empire.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:32.100
He compares it to the United
States more than once.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.590
The idea is that Germany is
gonna control a frontier,

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.390
dominate a frontier,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.710
and the central part of that frontier

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.123
is going to be Ukraine.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.710
Ukraine is also very important

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.810
in the antisemitic part of this analysis.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:46.950
Why?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.560
Because Hitler thinks it's going to be

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.350
relatively easy to seize Ukraine.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.850
Why?

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.600
Because in his way of seeing the world,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:01.560
the Soviet Union is a kind
of Jewish empire, right?

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.510
From his point of view, the
communists are all Jews,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.010
the Jews are all communists,

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.660
and therefore the Soviet state

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:09.360
is a kind of Jewish exploitation of

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.120
the simple Slavic and other masses, right?

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.100
The simple Slavic and other masses,

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.750
those are the racially inferior people

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:16.920
from Hitler's point of view,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.010
incapable of politics,
incapable of serious culture,

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.960
ripe for colonization.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.360
Not capable of anything
besides being colonized.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.600
But they will probably
prefer German colonization

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.043
to Jewish colonization.

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:31.950
And Hitler's ideas about this are quite,

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.240
I mean, they're really straightforward.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:36.030
We'll come, we may be
starving them to death.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.260
Actually we're planning to starve

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.340
tens of millions of them to death.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.250
But if we give them
beads, they'll be happy.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.140
And also if we have,

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.910
if we put up a pole in
the middle of the village

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.310
and put a radio on it and play
music, they'll be astonished

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.200
and they'll dance around the
pole and they'll be happy.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.030
That sort of thing, right?

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.143
That sort of thing.

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.460
His notion is that the Soviet Union

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.530
seems strong but it's weak.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:21:59.730
And the reason it's weak is that

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:02.190
it's just governed by the Jews.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:03.840
The Jews govern with ideas.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.640
And if you hit them with violence,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.070
the whole edifice will collapse

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.890
and then the happy masses will
accept a new colonial master

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.103
because it's better than
the old colonial master.

00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:18.540
I note the strong structural
resemblance of this

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.920
to the Russian war planning of late 2021

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.840
where the assumption again was that

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.520
there wasn't really Ukrainian state,

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.260
there was just a kind of exotic elite

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.580
which was perching on top,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.850
and one burst of violence would
destroy that exotic elite.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.830
And then the happy masses would accept

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:37.170
a new colonial master, okay?

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:38.193
Closed parenthesis.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:41.340
So both by way of the antisemitism

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.350
and by way of a (speaking German),

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:46.833
Hitler's ideas lead directly to Ukraine.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.413
Very briefly, how does
Hitler come to power?

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.320
How does Hitler come to power?

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.790
How does Hitler come to Ukraine?

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.950
One of the nice things about
teaching Ukrainian history

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.000
instead of German history

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.950
is that I don't have
to spend all this time

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:03.600
on like German public opinion

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.390
and like all these debates, ugh.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.280
That's in another class.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.160
No, it's an important thing
because if you take a class,

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.300
okay, now I'll make a serious point.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.460
If you take a class about Nazi Germany

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.350
or about the Holocaust,

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:18.120
it's gonna be about
Germany, Germany, Germany,

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.530
Germany, Germany, Germany, Germany.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.000
And the thing about that

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.820
is that there aren't that
many Jews in Germany,

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.290
and most of them survive.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.760
And so, if you wanna be serious

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:27.990
about understanding the Holocaust,

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.760
you have to understand something about

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.370
the countries beyond Germany
where the Jews actually lived

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:33.900
like Poland or like Ukraine

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:35.340
or like Belarus, or like Lithuania

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.530
or Hungary or Czechoslovakia, right?

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.830
So I'm giving Germany far too
short shrift here, of course,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:44.010
but there is a kind of
justification for all of this,

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.130
which is that you can't actually
figure out the Holocaust

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.320
just by looking at
Germany and German Jews.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.320
You have to move into German colonization

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.550
and the German destruction

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.700
or attempt to destroy neighboring states

00:23:56.700 --> 00:23:59.070
because that's where the
territory is where Jews live

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.480
and that's where the
territory is that Jews die.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.210
So I'm gonna give this the
rise, Hitler's rise to power,

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.473
very short shrift.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.410
The one factor which enables
it is the Great Depression.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.063
Germany is formed as a republic.

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:18.990
It is a moderately successful
republic in the 1920s.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.000
It has a hard time with
the Great Depression

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.093
in which 6 million people
roughly are unemployed.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.370
Political factor.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:30.180
The left is divided
between the socialist party

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:32.310
and the communist party.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:36.480
That makes it much easier
for Hitler to come to power.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.520
This, by the way, is a sort of universal

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.410
tactical political lesson

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.500
that the 21st century is
supposed to take from the 20th,

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.450
which is that when there's
a far right threat,

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:48.303
the left should not be divided, right?

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:52.175
No, I mean that,

00:24:52.175 --> 00:24:54.270
I mean, like I'm just stating what is out.

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.650
Like that's something, that is a lesson

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:57.420
that people, 21st century tacticians

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.280
have tried to learn from the 20th century,

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:01.830
and this is sort of exhibit A of this.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.540
Now, the reason why the German
left was divided is a bit,

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.950
is interesting from our point of view

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.510
because the German left had to be divided

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:11.430
because the German
communists were not permitted

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.530
to cooperate with the German socialists.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.830
The German communists were
told what to do by Moscow

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:18.800
and because...

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.143
How does this hook up?

00:25:21.143 --> 00:25:23.970
It hooks up because at
this time the Soviet Union

00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.100
is trying to build
socialism in one country.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:27.990
It has to defend itself, right?

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.970
It very nervously looks on the actions

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.650
of communist parties in Europe.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.560
And what it tells them to do
is almost always determined

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.170
by what it thinks Soviet
security interests are.

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:39.060
And those things change, right?

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.490
But they don't change in a
way which makes it very easy

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:44.730
for communist parties to do
well inside their own countries,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:45.900
let alone take power.

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.090
So the socialists are divided,

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.250
that's another important thing.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:53.070
The third important thing
is that the German republic

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:56.790
had already significantly
compromised itself.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:59.520
It was being run largely
by emergency decrees.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.100
The parliament had already
been largely marginalized.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.980
So, when Hitler is named as
chancellor in early 1933,

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.350
he inherits a situation where

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.970
executive power was already inflated,

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:10.800
legislative power had been suppressed,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:13.650
and all he really needed
was one good crisis,

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.663
which he got with the Reichstag fire,

00:26:16.825 --> 00:26:18.540
the burning of the German parliament,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.670
which he uses to declare
a state of emergency,

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.430
which stays in power until until he dies.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.440
By the summer of 1933,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.230
they've established primitive
concentration camps.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:31.200
They're hunting the
socialists and the communists

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.150
and the Nazis are the only legal party.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.060
From our point of view,

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.580
the more interesting shift
or equally interesting

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.560
is the shift in foreign affairs.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.560
Where to put it slightly brutally,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.260
much of Europe swings in the direction

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.050
of this new Nazi German state.

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.000
That's not how people like to
talk about it in retrospect.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.030
In retrospect, we were
all in the resistance.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.910
We're always all in the
resistance in retrospect, right?

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:01.910
But at the time, this
seemingly innovative, dynamic,

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:05.610
new German colossus drew a
lot of positive attention

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.060
even when it wasn't positive.

00:27:08.024 --> 00:27:11.070
People compromised in its
direction one way or another.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:15.630
So, the Germans rearmed
and nobody stopped them.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.280
The Germans took back some territory

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.680
that the French were
supposed to be occupying.

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.680
Nobody stopped them.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.840
The East European countries,

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.240
which if you'll remember from
what I said about Poland,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.640
the East European countries
who are having a hard time

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.490
as agrarian economies
during the depression,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.140
some of them tend towards Germany

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.630
because Germany is the rare country

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:39.120
right in the middle of
Europe, then as now,

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.890
which needs to import food,

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.900
but it has lots of
industrial goods to export.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.810
And so Germany makes deals
with Hungary and Romania

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.300
in which they agree to buy
German industrial output,

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:50.940
and Germany agrees to buy
their food at a certain price,

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.673
which during the depression
is incredibly attractive.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.063
In March of 1938,

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:01.500
everyone looks away as
Austria is absorbed by Germany

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.600
in the famous Anschluss

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.383
which is another one of those
German words you have to know.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.580
In September of 1938,
Italy, Great Britain,

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.320
France, and Germany

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.140
agree that Czechoslovakia
has to be partitioned

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.440
in Germany's favor

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:27.150
in the famous agreement at Munich

00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.383
which the Czechs always call

00:28:29.383 --> 00:28:32.550
the zrada
the betrayal at Munich.

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.230
So in all of these different ways

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.910
which I'm just kind of skimming over,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.130
everyone is tilting towards Germany,

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:42.240
if not necessarily ideologically
then maybe economically.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.300
But if economically, the
ideologically tends to follow.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.300
Not necessarily ideologically
but maybe geopolitically.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.010
But then once you've made
the geopolitical deal

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.470
then maybe your partner
isn't so unreasonable,

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:54.690
and maybe the Bolsheviks are much worse

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.270
which is how a lot of
people saw it at the time.

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.430
But speaking of the Bolsheviks,

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:03.930
the most radical tilt
towards Germany was 1939

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.470
when the Soviets and the Germans signed

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.930
in August and September in
two different agreements,

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.770
a de facto military
alliance and agreement,

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.610
an agreement how to occupy
Poland and the Baltic,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.020
and the Baltic states.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.030
So everyone looking back,

00:29:21.030 --> 00:29:23.220
we all resisted of course looking back

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.470
and then looking back, everyone
has a different history.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.090
But there is this general drift

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:29.580
which interestingly often
braces almost everybody

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.510
in some way or another

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.370
from the British to the
Soviets to the French.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.030
Everyone is drifting in
some way towards Germany.

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.710
And this only stops or this
only changes tone I should say

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.410
when someone agrees to fight a war.

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.090
And that someone in this case

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.360
agrees to fight a war is kind
of a strange way to put it,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:53.130
but the country that
resists Germany is Poland.

00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:56.580
And this matters hugely
for Ukrainian history.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.200
It's hard to say exactly how

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.500
but the reason why it matters is that

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:04.950
Hitler's plan for Ukraine was

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.853
we ally, we the Germans ally with Poland.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.023
And together with Poland,
we invade the Soviet Union.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:18.390
After which of course we
marginalize the Poles,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:21.390
keep them under control,
occupy their country, whatever.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:22.680
But that's the basic idea.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.720
The war for Hitler is the war in the East.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.800
This is something that's very hard

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.344
for Western people to understand.

00:30:28.344 --> 00:30:31.350
Like if I say that France was

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.090
a second rate concern for Hitler

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.360
and that he didn't wanna
fight the British at all,

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:37.230
people don't...

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:38.430
Obviously now it's very important

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.450
in French and British memory

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.110
but from Hitler's point of
view, that was secondary.

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.550
The only reason he needed
to fight the French

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.870
from his point of view was to make sure

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:46.950
that he didn't have a second front

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.530
when he went to Eastern Europe.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:50.700
That's why he had to fight the French.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.960
And he only had to fight the British

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.350
because they came in on the
side of, oh yes, the Poles.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.540
Okay, so the reason why the Poles

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:59.390
are so important in the story is that

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.303
by not agreeing to be a German ally,

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.750
they force Hitler to change his plans.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:09.450
And how does Hitler change his plans?

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.470
He changes his plans by hastily making

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.030
an alliance with the Soviet Union.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.160
Not what he meant to do, right?

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:20.103
But he does so in August
and September of 1939.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.330
So instead of invading the Soviets

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.800
with the Poles as an ally,

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.680
he invades Poland with
the Soviets as an ally

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.870
in September of 1939, right?

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:32.400
Not how he meant for it to happen.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.470
But because it happened that way,

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:36.510
then Ukrainian history
will take a certain turn

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.370
which I'm gonna return
to in just a second.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:40.830
I wanna repeat the thing
I said a moment ago.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.940
If the Poles don't fight in 1939

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.640
then it's unclear at what point the French

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.718
or the British ever would've
gotten into the war.

00:31:50.718 --> 00:31:51.870
Because the reason the
French and the British

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.340
got into the Second World War was that

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.760
they had by that time given
Poland a security guarantee

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.553
which they honored in a very abstract way.

00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.460
The French, this is literally true.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.730
The French went into
Germany a couple of miles

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.660
and then pulled back out,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.550
and so then they had technically honored

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.220
the terms of their agreement
to set up a second front.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.630
The British didn't do anything at first

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.820
but they waited for a
while, decided what to do.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:18.990
But the crucial thing is
they got into the war.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.640
And if the British and the French

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:22.230
don't get into the war in 1939,

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.810
it's unclear when they would
ever have gotten into the war.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:26.910
And if the British don't get into the war,

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:29.730
it's very, very unclear how the Americans

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.410
ever get into the war.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:32.700
Maybe the Americans get into a war

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.290
in Asia with the Japanese,

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.230
but without Britain it's
hard to see how Roosevelt

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.480
gets the Americans into the war in Europe.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.940
It's hard to see what line leads to that.

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:44.310
And if the Americans don't
get into the war in Europe,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.360
it's not only just that you don't have

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.590
the Americans fighting,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:48.660
it's also that you
don't have the Americans

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:51.480
supplying the Soviets
which is a huge X factor

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.210
which everyone forgets about
'cause it's very inconvenient.

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:56.160
But the reason why the Soviets

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.630
or one of the reasons why the Soviets

00:32:57.630 --> 00:32:59.580
were able to hold back the Germans at all

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.130
was that the Americans
were hugely supplying them

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.560
with Studebaker and Jeeps

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:07.080
and all kinds of other things
across the Pacific Ocean.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.690
So, if the Poles don't fight in 1939,

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:11.730
it's a very different world war.

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:13.350
I just wanna just note that

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:15.840
and now we'll go back to Ukraine, okay?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.330
So for Ukrainian history,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.380
what this means is that we get

00:33:21.592 --> 00:33:25.513
this strange period from 1939 to 1941

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.710
of what you could think of
as Molotov-Ribbentrop Europe,

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:35.220
Molotov-Ribbentrop were the
commissar for foreign Affairs,

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.850
the foreign minister of the
Soviet Union and of Germany.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.660
They're the ones who signed
the pact, August 23, 1939.

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:45.480
The notorious, people call
it the Hitler-Stalin Pact.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.113
The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
is usually what it's called.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.590
This creates a world where
for almost two years,

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.290
the Soviets and the
Germans are de facto allies

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.040
and the country and most
significantly for our region,

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.530
the country of Poland is destroyed.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.330
Poland wiped off the map.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.950
The Poles resist the
Germans for about six weeks

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.470
with actually much more
skill and dedication

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.570
than they're usually given credit for,

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:14.460
taking significant losses.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.310
But they're facing an
army attacking them from,

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.470
not only from the west,
but from the north,

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.463
from Prussia.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:22.620
Sorry about the geography.

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.470
But Germany actually was north of Poland

00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:27.960
as well as west of Poland
because of Prussia.

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.730
They were also attacking from the south

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:32.190
because Czechoslovakia
had been dismantled.

00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:35.340
And Slovak soldiers joined in the invasion

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.450
on the German side.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:38.340
And Czech tank, the Czechs had the best

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.230
military industry at the time.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.810
The best tanks, best explosives.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.570
So the Germans were invading
Poland with Czechoslovak tanks.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:47.370
All of that mitigated against Poland

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:49.170
even before, so the Soviet Union joined

00:34:49.170 --> 00:34:51.840
in the invasion on the 17th of September.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.970
So the Polish state is destroyed

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.800
which is not a trivial thing.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.560
It wasn't actually, it's
not actually normal.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.300
It seems normal, I mean,

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.307
again, there's a parallel here with 2022

00:35:02.307 --> 00:35:04.230
and the idea of the state doesn't exist

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.030
and destroy the state, right?

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:08.430
But it's not actually
normal to invade countries

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.110
and then say they don't exist

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.940
unless you're a colonizing power.

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.670
So Europeans constantly invaded countries

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:15.660
and then said they didn't exist.

00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:17.970
That's the history of the
Americas and Africa, right?

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.280
But for European countries

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.750
to invade other European countries

00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.820
and say that they didn't
exist, that was something new.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.230
And that's what the, both the Germans

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:27.870
and the Soviets did that with Poland.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:28.800
They invaded the country

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.150
then they said it didn't really exist.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.250
And therefore, this is important,

00:35:32.250 --> 00:35:34.260
what we're doing is not an occupation

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.970
because you can only occupy a country.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.590
Which may just seem like a word game

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.590
but it's actually, it's a legal maneuver

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:42.330
or an extra legal maneuver.

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:44.970
Because if there's not a country there,

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.500
then what you're doing
is not an occupation.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:48.570
You're not bound by
the laws of occupation,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:49.890
by the conventions on occupation,

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:51.360
by the customs of occupation.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.980
You're just saying that where you are

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.930
is a kind of undefined place

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.690
inhabited by autochthonous peoples, right,

00:35:57.690 --> 00:35:59.740
who we don't really know very much about.

00:36:01.617 --> 00:36:04.470
That is the German legal approach
to the invasion of Poland.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:05.760
The Soviet approach was
a little bit different.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.290
The Soviet approach was that
there was a class war going on.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.003
The Ukrainian and the
Belarusian peasants

00:36:12.003 --> 00:36:14.490
were being oppressed by the Polish lords.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.170
The Polish state had collapsed

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.560
and therefore we just came
in to aid our class allies.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.810
But again, the Soviets
were also careful to say

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.730
that there wasn't a Polish state anymore.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.830
The Polish state they
claimed had been destroyed.

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:26.940
This wasn't an occupation,

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.870
this was just territory

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.750
where there was a class war going on.

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:34.170
So, from the point of
view of Ukrainian history,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:38.760
what follows is that the
Ukrainian Soviet republic

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.103
expands very significantly to the west,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.670
pretty much to the
borders that it has now.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.890
The Molotov-Ribbentrop borders of 1939

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.050
are pretty much identical
to the western borders

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.290
of the independent Ukrainian state now.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:54.360
Another thing which happens
on these territories

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.660
is a kind of rapidly,

00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.590
like a fast forward version
of the Bolshevik policies

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.780
from 1917 to the 1930s.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.730
There the territories are next

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.790
and then there are four
waves of deportations.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.570
The deportations tend to affect above all

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.280
people associated with the Polish state.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.930
So more Poles than anybody else,

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.390
although later on there
are quite a few Jews

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.250
who didn't wanna take Soviet passports.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.500
But the basic idea is
destroy the Polish state

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:23.820
and then take the people
who have anything to do

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:24.653
with the Polish state.

00:37:24.653 --> 00:37:26.100
The colonists, the landowners,

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.530
the bureaucrats, the
soldiers, the foresters,

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.300
and get those people to Kazakhstan.

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:32.610
Get them to Kazakhstan,
get them to Siberia

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.473
where they won't cause any trouble.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.290
And then the notion was that

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:38.490
now we're carrying out a revolution

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.090
and so we are going to
transfer land from these people

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:45.690
to the oppressed Ukrainian
and Belarusian peasants.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.370
This revolution is really for you.

00:37:47.370 --> 00:37:48.870
Which is if you'll remember,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.690
that's a lot like the
1920s in the Soviet Union

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.110
where the peasants are brought in,

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:56.580
invited into the revolution

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.080
by the notion that they're gonna get land.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.510
And as you remember, the most
important political question

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.343
in this part of the world

00:38:01.343 --> 00:38:02.820
in the first half of the 20th century

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:03.873
is precisely land.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:09.570
So the terrain is de-Polandized.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.840
Poles are deported from it
and Poles lose their land

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.860
which is a bit like what had
happened in 1937, in 1938.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.050
If you did the reading

00:38:19.050 --> 00:38:21.960
in chapter three I think
it is of "Bloodlands,"

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.420
the most important national
action in the Soviet terror

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.730
was the Polish action in which 100,000

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.280
or around 100,000 Poles were shot.

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.780
About twice as many were deported.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.160
And so, Poles are being
removed from these terrains

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.350
where historically there
had been Poles, right,

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:39.903
in sort of wave after wave after wave.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.110
But I said this was accelerated.

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:45.600
Not long after that in 1940,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.903
so the peasants get the land in early 1940

00:38:47.903 --> 00:38:50.220
and then collectivization
starts in late 1940.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.740
So, the stage is very short

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.600
and peasants are generally disillusioned

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.220
by collectivization.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:59.670
And even many West Ukrainian communists

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.340
are disillusioned by this.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.750
The West Ukrainian communists

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:05.610
who had been part of the
Polish Communist Party

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.440
had been telling their people that

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.420
Soviet Ukraine is Ukrainian state,

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.160
that you're all gonna get land,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.700
and our national culture
is going to be respected.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.070
Collectivization disillusioned them.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:20.163
The fake elections also
disillusions many of them.

00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:22.830
And they tend to fade from

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.130
any kind of significance in the region.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.400
The reason I mention that

00:39:28.492 --> 00:39:29.820
is to try to suggest something

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:31.830
which is gonna be important
in the next lecture,

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:35.520
which is that there had been
Ukrainian political life.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:38.250
Not in the Soviet Union,
right, but in Poland.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.460
It had been stunted and
oppressed but it existed.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.960
There were Ukrainian churches,

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.150
there was Ukrainian civil society,

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.340
there was Ukrainian educational society,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.660
there were Ukrainian cooperatives,

00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:50.310
the Ukrainian newspapers.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.450
All of that.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.880
Under Soviet rule that
becomes impossible, right?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.100
There is a Soviet, it's
called Soviet Ukraine

00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:58.020
but independent forms of civil society

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.450
from whatever they might
be are not allowed.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:02.280
The way that Leninism works is that

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.200
everything that one might
think of a civil society

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.940
has to be part of one larger structure,

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.670
has to be part of the
state or of the party.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:10.380
So all of the legal political parties

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:13.290
that had existed under
Poland are now dissolved.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.230
The communists are now discredited

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.223
which leaves who?

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.380
Hmm?
- Jewish nationalists.

00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:25.027
- Okay, among Ukrainian political parties.

00:40:25.027 --> 00:40:25.860
- [Student] The nationalists.

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:27.120
- The nationalists, right?

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:31.110
The situation has selected
for the nationalists.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.000
And you'll see why
that's important later on

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.830
but I just wanna mark it right now.

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:36.480
Okay.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.000
So, the last stage of this

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.960
and where I'm gonna leave you

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:42.300
is Operation Barbarossa itself.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.610
Which is the Operation Barbarossa

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.350
is the invasion of the Soviet Union.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:48.180
It's when Hitler finally
gets to do the thing

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.790
which he wanted to do which
is invade the Soviet Union,

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:52.500
try to seize Ukrainian grain,

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.810
also try to seize the
Azerbaijani oil fields,

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:56.190
that's a secondary objection.

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:59.100
Destroy the Soviet state as such.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:02.190
There are three larger policies
attached to this invasion

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.690
that are formulated by the Germans.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:06.093
The first is what they
call the Final Solution,

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.670
which is initially the idea

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.010
that the Jews will somehow
be deported out of the way

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:15.300
to Madagascar or to Siberia, who knows,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:17.250
but somehow made to vanish.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.500
The final solution over
the course of this war

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.260
will become more
immediate, more proximate,

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.690
and more directly lethal.

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:25.710
Over the course of the war,

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.770
it will move from this kind
of vague notion of deportation

00:41:28.770 --> 00:41:31.110
to killing them first over pits

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:33.690
and then eventually in gas chambers.

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.740
The second larger policy is
what they call the Hunger Plan.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.720
By the terms of the Hunger Plan,

00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:41.490
the Germans were going to keep

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.410
the Stalinist collective farm.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.240
They were going to try
to control Ukrainian

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.070
and general Soviet agriculture

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:51.753
but direct the surpluses from
Ukraine to Germany, right?

00:41:51.753 --> 00:41:54.780
In a way, the same dream
of the First World War,

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:57.840
direct the surpluses, colonial exploit.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.270
Direct the surpluses from
Ukraine back to Germany

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:01.570
and to the rest of Europe.

00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.480
And this will also be carried out

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:10.620
in the sense that cities
are going to be starved,

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:12.750
most notably Leningrad
which is in Soviet Russia,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:14.610
but also tens of thousands
of people will die

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:17.490
in Ukrainian cities such
as Kharkiv and Kyiv.

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:21.120
It's carried out most notably
in the prisoner of war camps

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.580
where through early 1942,

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.770
the Germans carry out a policy
of deliberately starving

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.033
Soviet prisoners of war,

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:30.240
almost regardless of ethnicity.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.230
Some ethnicities are treated

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.430
a little bit differently than others.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:34.650
Jews are treated much worse.

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:38.220
But in general, Soviet
prisoners of war starved.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.310
About 3.1 million die of
hunger and related diseases

00:42:41.310 --> 00:42:44.640
which is a huge number,
it's a terrifying number.

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.650
By the end of, at the end of 1941,

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.200
this was actually the
most lethal German policy.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.640
More people were starved to death

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.100
in these open air prison, not even camps,

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.530
so just enclosures where people
are left to die basically.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.510
Camp in a way dignifies it too much.

00:42:57.510 --> 00:43:00.090
More people had died this
way than in the Holocaust

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:02.480
as of the end of 1941.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:06.510
In 1942, the Holocaust, the
Final Solution will pass

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:08.040
in part because the Germans begin to think

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:10.140
they have to recruit
people from these camps

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:12.870
in order to do various
kinds of police work

00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:13.860
and other work for them.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.450
Which by the way means that

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.000
many of the local
collaborators in the Holocaust

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.400
had been extracted from
these camps, right,

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.190
which gives you a sort of sense
of some of the choices that

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:25.650
or non-choice that people faced.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:29.040
The third major policy
was called Generalplan Ost

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.710
and that was the larger
notion of colonization

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.320
that over the course of the next decades,

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.260
tens of millions of Slavs
would be moved out of the way,

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.700
starved or dispersed,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.980
what we would call ethnically cleansed.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.440
The Jews by now would be
gone some way or another

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:44.880
and Germany would establish

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.070
a whole series of nice small towns,

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.540
everything very well-organized,

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:50.130
white picket fences.

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.820
The Ukrainians or the Slavs

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:54.240
significantly reduced in numbers

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.130
but working as de facto slaves.

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.050
That was the basic idea,
that was the blueprint.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.400
They never got there, right,

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.813
because they lost the war.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.720
The Holocaust which is the
last thing I wanna talk about

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.230
is the one of these three policies

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:18.600
which actually, so to speak,

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.100
is worse than it was planned, right?

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.690
The general idea was that

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.420
we're going to starve out
everybody or disperse everybody

00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.400
that the Germans are never
quite able to do that.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.560
They do starve quite a
large number of people,

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.880
as you see in "Bloodlands."

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.370
They do disperse quite
a large number of people

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.650
but the most focus killing policy

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.420
and the one that accelerates

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.210
consistently over the course
of the war is the Holocaust.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.220
So I just wanna leave you with
a couple of thoughts about it

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.543
and then we'll be done.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:46.090
The first thought about this is that

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:52.130
the Holocaust has to do with
not only Hitler's general idea

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.840
that the Jews are
responsible for everything,

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.150
but the particular idea
which follows from this,

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:58.680
that if we're losing the war,

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.810
it must be the fault of the Jews.

00:45:00.810 --> 00:45:04.980
So for example, if we
invade the Soviet Union

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.710
and the British and the Americans

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.900
come in on the side of the Soviets,

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.560
that must be explained not by
Pearl Harbor or anything else,

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:16.350
it must be explained by the
fact that the Jews are in charge

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.120
on Wall Street and Fleet Street,

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.250
as well as in the Kremlin, right?

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:25.250
So, defeat in war makes the
conspiracy theory more necessary

00:45:25.532 --> 00:45:27.570
and more pervasive.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.970
And also it should be said
more sociologically useful

00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:31.980
to the German population as a whole.

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.860
The conspiratorial antisemitism
becomes more important

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:36.750
for Germans during the war,

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.703
especially after they start to lose.

00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:44.523
So this is specific to the end of 1941.

00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:47.070
When Germany,

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.650
when it's clear that the
Germans have lost the war

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:53.160
that they planned to fight which is 1941,

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.780
that's when Hitler shifts the idea

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:58.590
that all the Jew are to be
killed, late 1941, early 1942.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:45:59.423
When I say the German,

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.300
the war they thought
they were gonna fight,

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.410
this is very important, right?

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.300
So this is not a military history class.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.133
You've heard me bemoan

00:46:04.133 --> 00:46:05.430
that there's not enough military history.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:07.410
I'm just gonna make one
little military history point

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:09.630
which is that the wars never go the way

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.190
you think they're gonna go.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:13.800
They never go the way you
think they're gonna go.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.750
And looking back, it's almost impossible

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.930
to overstate just how
dramatic that truth is.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.460
The Germans invaded the Soviet Union

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.650
thinking that it would
fall within 12 weeks

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:23.940
on the outside.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.880
Six to 12 weeks, the Soviet
Union was going to collapse.

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.550
All of their preparations
were made on that assumption.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.310
They didn't have supply lines planned,

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.290
they didn't bring winter clothing.

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:35.490
The whole assumption is that

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:38.550
this is gonna collapse within
a couple of months, right?

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:39.840
And of course it didn't do that

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.100
and they couldn't admit that they failed,

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.350
and they kept fighting
and so on as one does.

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:44.700
And they blame someone else

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.450
and that's part of the history
of the Holocaust, right?

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:52.800
But it's irrelevant for
the politics of all this.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:53.670
When I say they didn't,

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.320
they lost the war they
thought they were fighting,

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.460
that's what I mean, right?

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:58.110
They expected the Soviet Union to collapse

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:59.910
in a couple of months.

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:02.670
The World War from Hitler's point of view

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:03.750
is the war that happens

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.150
because they didn't destroy
the Soviet Union immediately.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.580
Their thought was the Soviet
Union falls immediately.

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:10.230
There's nothing anyone can do about it.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.150
But it turned out that was not true.

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:14.010
The second point I wanna
make about the Holocaust

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.350
and then we'll be done is that

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:17.730
even in the Holocaust,

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.350
and this is the reading in "Black Earth"

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:20.760
which I hope you'll do carefully,

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.310
but even in the Holocaust,

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:26.070
or I should say even
especially in the Holocaust,

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:29.160
there's never a moment when
politics ceases to matter.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.560
There's never a moment where
you get into some sphere

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:35.220
of pure evil or pure ethics or something

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.630
where human experience and
human calculations don't matter.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:41.880
The way that people behave
during the Holocaust

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:44.130
has to do not just with German intentions

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:46.020
and German policies of mass killing,

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.420
but also with their own calculations

00:47:48.420 --> 00:47:51.240
about what might work
out the best for them.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:54.180
And in the case of the
population of the Soviet Union,

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:57.180
of the prewar Soviet Union
where this is most relevant

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.100
is Hitler's idea that Jews are communists

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:00.600
and communists are Jews.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.840
Now, most Soviet citizens know that

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.000
there are certainly some
anti-Semites in the Soviet Union

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.550
but in general, most Soviet
citizens know that's not true

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.440
because it's kind of their
everyday experience, right?

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.593
Like they're communists, right?

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.590
The vast majority of communists

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.690
were actually not Jews, right?

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.220
And if you're in the Soviet
Union, you know that.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:23.070
But the politics of this is

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.140
that if the Germans come
into the Soviet Union

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.530
and they say, all the communists were Jews

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.180
and you're a communist,

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.053
what do you say?

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.960
I mean, unless you're heroic or you fled,

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:36.303
you say, yes, they were.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.070
Right?

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.520
Because that shifts the
responsibility from you

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.920
for this thing which is supposedly doomed

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.870
communism onto the Jews.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:47.943
That's a form of politics, right?

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.430
The Germans were fooled by this.

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.710
They sort of fooled themselves
and other people fooled them.

00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:53.970
But that's a form of politics.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:57.210
The Germans come in with an
idea of the way the world works.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:59.190
People adapt to that idea
of the way the world works

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.360
in a way that suits them

00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.650
by shifting the responsibility

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.570
for the Soviet system onto the Jews.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.460
That's part of the
history of the Holocaust.

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:08.550
And then of course, in the
Soviet Union as elsewhere,

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.970
the vast majority of the work
that's done in the Holocaust

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:12.600
is not done by the Germans.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.490
It's done by local people.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.620
And in taking part in this policy,

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.920
they're also expressing a
kind of personal commitment

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.500
to a certain view of the world,

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:23.850
which is that the Jews are communists,

00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:24.750
the communists are Jews,

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.730
the Soviet Union has to be destroyed.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:28.600
All of this is incredibly awkward

00:49:29.688 --> 00:49:32.250
after Soviet power comes back.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.950
And how Stalinism deals with all of this,

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:38.460
this very messy record of collaboration

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:40.650
and resistance during the Holocaust

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.060
and during Soviet occupation in general,

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.740
how Stalinism deals with this

00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.500
is gonna be our subject
when we come back next week.

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.700
So, thank you very much.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:55.253
(gentle music)

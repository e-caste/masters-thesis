00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.920
so this is the fourth lecture
for Economics

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.950
252, Financial Markets.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.290
And I wanted today to talk
about some really basic

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.630
concepts, about portfolios.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.350
A portfolio is a collection
of investments.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.470
And I want to talk about risk
and return, and eventually get

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.950
into the core theory, which is
the Capital Asset Pricing

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.200
Model, in finance.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.960
But first I wanted to say
something about last lecture.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.650
Last time, I talked about
innovation in finance.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.100
And I presented finance
as a sort of branch of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.600
engineering in a way.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.200
We invent financial devices.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.790
And the devices serve certain
functions, and, in order to

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.120
serve those functions, they have
a number of details that

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.730
have to be gotten right.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.240
Moreover, there's a process of
invention, and the process of

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.030
invention involves
experimentation, and when an

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.630
experiment doesn't work, we
forget about it and we move

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.920
on, but when it does
work it gets copied

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.920
all over the world.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.970
So, I thought a nice way to
transition to today's lecture

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.200
would be to talk about one very
important moment in the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.840
history of finance: When
the first real

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.440
important stock was invented.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.792
And it was, see if I can spell
it right, Vereenigde

00:01:41.792 --> 00:01:44.940
Oost-Indische, I might
be misspelling

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:54.640
this, Compagnie 1602.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.530
This was the first --

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.780
Did I get that all right?

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.570
I think got it right!

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.350
That's Dutch for The United
East India Company.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.090
It was founded in that year.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.350
It was a time, when Holland was
at war, and the government

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.850
was worried about the economy
and was willing to experiment

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.610
with raising capital to keep
the economy prospering.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.840
And someone had this idea.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.270
Let's start a company
with shares in it,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.360
and let's trade them.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.880
And in the same year, and I
can't write this in Dutch, but

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.900
they created the Amsterdam
Stock Exchange.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.360
And initially it had
only one stock.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.380
And so this is called VOC.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.670
OK?

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.260
And it was a trading company.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.430
They were going to set them up,
and they were going to buy

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.150
ships, and they're going to sail
all over the world, and

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.040
they were going to trade
in various commodities.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.580
So, it sounds pretty basic.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.245
But no one had ever
done this before.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.150
So, it's interesting how
much got invented in

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.980
this one year, 1602.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.540
First of all, they invented
a corporate logo.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.350
I don't know if I
have it right.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.210
It was something like V-O-C,
I don't know if I did that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.270
right, just like we would put
on, you know, advertisements

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.240
for a company today.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.230
Maybe that's not
very important.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.420
But what's really important,
also, is that this was a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.720
long-term venture.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.590
There were lots of ventures
already in Europe, where a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.290
group of merchants would get
together and they would pool

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.250
their money for one trip.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.420
They would send ships out, and
these ships would trade and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.055
come back, and then they'd
dissolved the whole thing.

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:04.380
But this was different.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.940
This one was going to
go indefinitely.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.880
And in their initial
announcement, they said, we're

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.940
going to set up operations
all over the world.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.405
We're going to have an office
in India, and another one, I

00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:22.100
don't know, in Indonesia,
and, it's a big thing.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.040
And in the new world, in
America, but primarily East

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.020
India, from the name.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.815
But the interesting thing is
they set up a stock exchange

00:04:38.815 --> 00:04:40.270
to trade shares in it.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.010
And the stock exchange
arranged that you

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.010
could trade every day.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.820
So, there was lively trading.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.170
This was part of the idea.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.760
Because when they set up a
company in those days, you

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.010
could get your shares when they
founded the company, and

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.050
that was it, right?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.000
I mean, you couldn't trade
them, or maybe you could

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.530
infrequently.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.930
The company might open its books
once a year, and they

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.310
would take new shareholders
in.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.240
But someone had -- hey,
this is an idea.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.560
Even though the VOC doesn't open
its books regularly, we

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.710
can trade them every day.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.640
What difference does it make?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.360
You know, so we're going to
have stockbrokers on the

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.480
Amsterdam stock exchange.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.060
And maybe they'll own some
shares in VOC, OK?

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.560
And then they'll have an
inventory of shares.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.780
And then somebody wants
to buy some, you buy

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.800
them from the broker.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.480
You don't have to contact
the company.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.470
And then the broker will, you
know, maybe at the year end,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.875
will report to the company
that you own the shares.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:45.240
But doesn't have to, right?

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.320
A broker does it.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.050
All right.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.030
So, the broker says you
own these shares.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.240
You trust the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, because they have

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.940
rules and code of ethics, so you
think you own, well, you

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.755
do own VOC shares if you
buy them from a broker.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:03.450
The VOC doesn't know it yet,
but you've got the shares,

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.300
because the broker is a member
of the Amsterdam Stock

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.660
Exchange and says that
you have the shares.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.495
Then, almost immediately after
1602, a funny thing happened.

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:16.440
Can you guess what it was?

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.350
The brokers started selling
more shares

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.060
than they had, right?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.020
What's to stop them
from doing that?

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.860
Or some of them did
that, right?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.680
So, the broker maybe owns some
shares in VOC and he gets lots

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.390
of buyers and the broker ends
up selling more, more shares

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.880
than he has.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.360
And he thinks, well, I'll get
them later, you know.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.510
Well, and he says, what do my
customers care, if they own

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.540
shares, because I don't
report to the

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.440
company right away anyway.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.620
I'll make good on this.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.270
I'm a broker.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.360
I know what to do.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.770
I'll buy them later
and I'll get them.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.820
So, you see what starts
to happen?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.810
There are more shares out there
being traded than there

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.860
exists in the company, because
the broker is selling shares

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.570
that he doesn't own.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:11.640
And so there began in, way back,
even in this time, there

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:23.380
began what we call short-sales,
short-interest.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:29.050
It happens when you set up a
stock market and you allow,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.210
well, we would call it today
street name, owning a stock in

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.380
street name.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.770
We have stock exchanges, many
stock exchanges in the world

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.820
today, and they, including --

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.110
By the way, the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange is the oldest

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.470
stock exchange in the world
and it's still trading.

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.380
But it has merged.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.990
First, it merged with Brussels,
and Paris, and now

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:59.250
they're called Euronext
Amsterdam.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.070
But they're still doing this.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.010
Nothing stopped them
in over 400 years.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.780
They keep doing it.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.450
But this stock exchange, and
many others like it, allows

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:17.110
brokers to sell you stocks in
what's called street name, OK?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.450
And what that means is that
when you buy shares, the

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:32.780
broker puts in your account that
you own these shares, but

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.840
the company doesn't know it,
because the actual ownership

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.200
is registered in the name
of the broker, OK.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:46.890
And so, the broker is
selling you shares.

00:08:46.890 --> 00:08:51.080
And it's only through the broker
that you know that you

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.510
have shares.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.990
So, the broker on the stock
exchange may be short.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.500
May have sold more shares
then he or she has.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.330
That's all right, OK?

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.320
It happened as long ago as right
from the beginning of

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.830
the stock market.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.020
There was a scandal.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.930
I was reading the history of
this, and, who was the guy?

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:33.590
Isaac La Maire, a Dutchman,
in 1609.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.980
He was not a broker, he
was a businessman.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.360
He was able to sell more
shares than he had.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.690
So, he had negative --

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.610
A broker allowed
him to do that.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.500
And so, he had a short-interest
in VOC, massive

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.740
short-interest. And people who
own VOC shares started

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.580
thinking, what's
going on here?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.560
Someone is selling, he's
borrowing shares from a broker

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.810
and selling them.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.940
That tends to bring
down the price.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:15.750
And there was a downward
movement in the Amsterdam

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:16.870
stock market.

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:21.550
And this guy was blamed for
having shorted the stock, and

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:27.640
forcing down the price.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.840
And so, the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange, for two years from

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.700
1609 to 1611, banned
short-selling, but then they

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.920
decided to let it go again.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.340
The point of all this
discussion --

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:47.740
I'm telling you a story about
Holland 400 years ago, but the

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.750
reason I'm telling you the story
is to try to emphasize

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.760
how certain things just
happen naturally.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:58.900
Once you set the framework up,
you set up a big company, and

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.130
it's a company that lasts
a long time, OK.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.080
It's very valuable.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:09.260
Anybody can buy shares in it,
OK, so it's democratic.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:13.910
And the value is very uncertain,
because this

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.460
company is going to be in
business into the far future.

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:19.310
And it's building a whole
arrangement, an empire of

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:23.620
trading posts and ships, and
who knows what it's worth.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.280
So, the price is very uncertain,
and buying it is

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.360
sort of a gamble.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.210
And so, the price starts
fluctuating wildly.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:37.160
And it attracts all kinds of
interest. And some people

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.190
think it's going to go up, and
some people think it's going

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:42.080
to go down, and they start
debating about this, and

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.800
wondering about this.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.130
And some guy like Isaac La Maire
thinks it's going to go

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.420
down, so he wants to
short the stock.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.300
He wants to sell, he doesn't
want to buy it, he wants to

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.965
short it, so he can have
a negative quantity.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.260
Other people are really positive
and excited about it,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:05.400
and they want to buy
all they can get.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.070
And they want to even
buy more than can.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.500
They want to borrow money
to buy the stock.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.010
So, you have this tension
between the shorts like Isaac

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:19.330
La Maire and the gung-ho traders
who want to buy it.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.530
And it creates a lot of
volatility in the market.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:29.660
But the whole effect of
this is to create

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:31.020
interest in the stock.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.090
So, it brings in money.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:39.450
And it ultimately made the VOC
very successful, because so

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:42.140
many people wanted to give money
to this trading company.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.450
So, they were able to build
hundreds of ships, and set up

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.220
big outposts all over.

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:49.980
And it became very valuable.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.470
And it was an invention, kind
of a social invention.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:55.160
I'm thinking, it's kind
of analogous.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.160
We have recent inventions
that we think

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.190
about, the social media.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:05.840
We have, you know, Facebook and
other recent inventions.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.360
This was an invention
like that.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.960
It was an invention that
got people together and

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:14.930
communicating and excited
about something.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:19.200
And it created a sort of a game
that people were playing

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.770
that turned out to
be productive.

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:24.250
That's why it was copied
all over the world.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:30.640
So, the core concepts which
began in Holland in 1609 are

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.940
everywhere now.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.630
Every country of the
world has this.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:40.450
I should also add, by the way,
that VOC was a limited

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:42.880
liability corporation.

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.670
Amazing.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:47.060
When I told you that limited
liability came in

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:49.210
in 1811 in New York.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.280
I think I qualified that.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:56.040
It used to be that some
companies had in their charter

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.730
an agreement with the
government, that the

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.540
stockholders had limited
liability.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.870
What came in in 1811 in New York
was a law that said all

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:10.900
companies are limited
liability.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.390
And moreover, anybody in the
world can start a -- well,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:18.420
anyone in New York can start a
company, and it will always be

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.910
limited liability.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.230
So don't worry, you can
invest in any company.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.500
And you do not need to worry
about being sued for the debts

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.210
of the company.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:32.340
Well, back then, Holland didn't
go that far, but they

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.730
did create one company that did
have limited liability.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:40.540
So what that meant was, you
could invest in this company,

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.190
and it's just a game,
you know?

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.100
I can't lose more than
I put into it.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.620
And if these guys turn out to be
crooks and some of them are

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.050
hanged for their crimes, no
problem with me, because I'm

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:53.500
an innocent investor.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.560
The law doesn't require that I
investigate, you know, whether

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.300
the guys who run the company
are really honest. Let's

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.810
protect investors.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.640
So, all you can lose is
the money you put in.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:11.770
So, it created a tremendous
opportunity.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.980
It was talked about, because the
stock price went up and up

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:20.010
and up, and it made people
rich who invested in it.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.980
But it was also very volatile.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.730
It went up and down.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.710
People had never seen anything
like this before, because

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.950
nothing was so actively traded,
and had such an

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:37.970
interesting story that you can
change your mind about from

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.220
one day to the next.

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.380
Anyway, I didn't want
just tell stories.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.880
This is a story, though, that
illustrates our last lecture.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.170
It was a breakthrough
innovation.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:55.840
It was a kind of gambling,
but not gambling.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:58.120
It was gambling on
real things.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.560
And so, you know, people like to
gamble, but, you know, it's

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.140
usually a waste of their time.

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.580
This is not a waste time.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:10.990
This was setting up trading
around the world.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.900
And so, it was important,
it was a very important

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.650
innovation.

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.340
But now I want to use it as a
lead-in to the main theme of

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:29.170
this lecture, which is about
portfolio management and risk.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:33.895
And the first concept I wanted
to talk about is leverage.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:41.280
Well, and also let me add
the equity premium.

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.136
These are the two
main concepts.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.410
Maybe I'll do equity premium
first. Here's the conundrum

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.050
that people were
presented with.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:58.800
And I'll stay on the VOC story,
but it's much more

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.760
general than that.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:04.680
VOC, after a few years out,
people thought, you know, this

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.090
company is amazing.

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:10.880
It's just growing so fast, it's
making so much money, it

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.110
might have a really high return,
like unbelievably

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:18.040
high, like 20% a year,
or even more, but

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.830
let's say 20% a year.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.650
And that's what generated
excitement.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.290
But some people wondered,
well, how can it be?

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:33.260
Maybe it's earned 20%, but how
can it consistently do that?

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:44.100
So, let me put ''puzzle.'' We've
gone through 400 years

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.670
of history since the VOC
was established.

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.770
And since then, it seems to be
remaining true that companies'

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:57.210
shares do extremely well.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:59.340
And that's a puzzle.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.190
Because you know, if you can
make a high return on some

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.800
investment, wouldn't you think
that enough people would flock

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.260
into the investment, so
that it no longer --

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.480
you know, too many people trying
to do this, so it's no

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.520
longer performing so well?

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:28.640
But in fact, it seems like the
average return on stocks has

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.800
been very high.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.540
This is a theme in Jeremy
Siegel's book Stocks for the

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:40.750
Long Run, which I have on the
reading list. Siegel has data,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.620
doesn't go back to 1602,
but it goes back to

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:48.100
the nineteenth century.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.790
And he says that the geometric
average return, annual return,

00:18:52.790 --> 00:19:00.790
on the United States stock
market from 1871 to 2006 was

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:05.190
6.8% a year, corrected
for inflation.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.200
That's 6.5% a year
after inflation.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.460
So, if you're at 3% or
4% inflation, right,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.990
that's 10% a year.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.960
Let's compare that with
short-term governments, which

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.970
are the safest thing in
the United States.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:29.900
The average real return on them
was only 2.8% a year.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.560
So, the difference
is 4% a year.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.020
So, for well over 100 years in
the United States, stocks

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.320
performed extremely well.

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:47.390
Moreover, he points out there
was no 30-year period since

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:56.050
1831 to 1861 when stocks
under-performed either

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.690
short-term or long-term bonds.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:03.580
So, the stocks have been
good investments.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.760
What do we make of that?

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.770
Don't people learn?

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:11.270
You'd think if people learn,
they would all want to do the

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.650
good thing.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.150
Why does anyone invest
in something else?

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.210
That was the puzzle here.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.960
It's not just a United
States phenomenon.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:27.940
The London Business School
professors Dimson, Marsh, and

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:31.650
Staunton wrote a book called The
Triumph of the Optimists.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.930
That is, optimists about
the stock market.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.820
And they looked at the equity
premium in many different

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.930
countries around the world.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.900
And they found that all of the
countries, and this is looking

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.920
over much of the twentieth
century, all of the countries

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.030
had an equity premium, that the
stocks did better than the

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.860
bonds of that country.

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:59.510
The lowest of the countries
they studied was Belgium,

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.500
which had an equity premium of
only 3%, and the highest was

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.910
Sweden, which had an equity
premium of 6%.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.370
So, that's an interesting
question.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:16.750
How can it be that some asset,
namely stocks, outperform all

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:18.000
other assets.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.670
That comes up then to, what
is the standard answer?

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.040
Why is it?

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.090
And standard answer is risk.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.185
Stocks are riskier.

00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:45.340
The price jumps up and down from
day to day, so the extra

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.240
return is a risk premium.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:55.750
That is what I want to pursue
today in this lecture.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.410
Does that explain the
equity premium?

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:03.570
How should we think about
the equity premium?

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:12.210
So, what I'm going to do is,
feature the theory that was

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:19.710
originally invented by Harry
Markowitz when he was a

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:23.400
graduate student at the
University of Chicago.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.950
And shortly after he was a
student, in 1952, he published

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:35.000
a classic article in the Journal
of Finance that really

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.220
changed the way we think
about risk in

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.540
finance, changed it forever.

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.090
It gets back at this core idea,
you know, people looking

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:51.120
at, going back to the days of
the VOC, people had the idea,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.050
you know I think stocks are
the best investment.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.780
OK, I'm writing that down, and
I'm putting it in quotation

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.590
marks, because it's not a
term that I would use.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.930
What is the best investment?

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.930
Well they say, look,
the VOC is just

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:15.070
returning tremendous amounts.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.880
Any smart person would just
put as much as he can into

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.560
that investment.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.180
Something seems wrong
about that.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.620
I mean, it can't
be true that --

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.150
so what Markowitz --

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.610
when I went back and read his
Journal of Finance article in

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:37.350
1952, it's kind of remarkable to
me that what he was talking

00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:43.380
about wasn't known
yet in 1952.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.620
He was getting at this core
idea of what's the best

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.230
investment.

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:51.270
And how do you judge what's
the best investment.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:55.030
And judging from his article,
to me it sounded

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.320
so basic and simple.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.170
Of course, I've studied
finance.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.800
But it seemed odd to me
that everyone didn't

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.620
know that in 1952.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.870
So let me --

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.300
the question is --

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.110
I'll kind of paraphrase
what Markowitz says.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:21.190
Let's imagine that you've
got a job as a

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:23.090
portfolio manager, OK?

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:25.610
And you're kind of
mathematically inclined.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:27.910
And you know numbers, and
statistics, and you know how

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:29.890
to compute standard
deviations and

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.550
variances, things like that.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.660
So, what is the first
thing you do?

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.380
You're a numbers person,
OK, or a math person.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:42.270
But now imagine you've been
entrusted with managing a

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.280
portfolio for some investor.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.170
And the investor gives you a
horizon, and you know, let's

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:48.360
say you're managing
it for one year.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.130
OK?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.530
And you're thinking, all right,
what should I do?

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.780
Well, I want to collect data on
every possible investment I

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.180
could make.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.610
Not just stocks and bonds, but
real estate, commodities,

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.710
whatever, OK?

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.500
And I can for each of these --

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.020
I can compute what the average
return was on those

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:07.690
investments.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.430
OK?

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.320
And I can compute the variance,
and I can compute

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.890
the covariance and correlation,
right?

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.810
So Markowitz, do you see it?

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:18.870
I've got all the data.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:21.450
Now I could say, I don't
believe these data are

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:25.510
relevant to the future, because
I'm smarter, or I can

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:29.000
predict that some company's
going to do better than it did

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.930
in the past, or some asset class
will do better than it

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.510
did in the past.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.850
But let's step back.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:35.620
Let's do it basic.

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.160
Let's just think like a
mathematician here, all right?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.100
Let's just take as given all the
historical average returns

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.260
and variances and
co-variances.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.300
And Markowitz says, well what's
the best portfolio

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:49.020
given that?

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:49.790
Ok?

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.660
I could compute all
these numbers.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:57.400
What's the best assembly
of all these things?

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.130
And you know, he realized
that nobody had ever

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:01.820
thought like that.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.270
Isn't that a well-defined
problem?

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.350
I give you all the variances,
I give you all the

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.350
covariances, I give you all
the average returns.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.430
And I say, let's just assume
that this is going to continue

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:16.530
like this, what should
I do as an investor?

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.930
And it's funny, Markowitz said,
he was reminiscing.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.510
He won the Nobel Prize later.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:24.680
And deservedly, I think.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.130
This was a breakthrough idea.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.970
He said as a graduate student
he was chatting with someone

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.480
in the hallway and thinking
about this.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.550
And he said, it suddenly
hit me as an epiphany.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.300
If I have these statistics, I
ought to be able to compute

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.150
the optimal portfolio.

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:43.610
It's mathematical, right?

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:45.390
It's just one thing.

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.380
What is the optimal portfolio?

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.320
It took him like two or
three days to figure

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.310
the whole thing out.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.740
You know, it's almost
like, haven't I set

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:54.560
it up in your mind?

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.050
You see the problem.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:58.590
You could figure this
out too, right?

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.610
You put your ingenuity
onto it.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:03.270
The funny thing is,
nobody thought

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:05.080
about it before Markowitz.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.350
So actually, I was intrigued
by that.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:12.960
So,, I went back trying to find,
what people were talking

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.780
about before 1952.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:25.360
And we have a new thing on the
web, relatively new, called --

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.450
you ever play with this?

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:28.300
It's called
ngrams.googlelabs.com.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:41.600
And what you can do is, you can
put in any phrase you want

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.710
and search it for the, it goes
back like 400 years.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:47.310
In English, you can't
do Dutch.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.170
I don't think.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.540
Maybe you can do that, too.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.720
I didn't try.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.250
And you can start to see
what people were

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.100
talking about in books.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.820
They have all these books
scanned in now.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.480
Now you can search
for key words.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:08.110
And so, I did a search on
''portfolio analysis.'' That's

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.330
what this is all about, right?

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:12.200
Figuring out what the optimal
portfolio of stocks, bonds,

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.190
commodities is.

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.010
Hardly anyone even used
the term before 1952.

00:28:18.010 --> 00:28:22.070
I guess, it didn't exist. There
was no theory of --

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.760
you try to imagine.

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:23.550
How can that be?

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.550
I mean, you had all these

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:26.470
sophisticated banks in finance.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.490
They had no theory of
portfolio analysis.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.190
And I looked at portfolio
variance, portfolio return.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.600
It all started with
Harry Markowitz.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.260
Again, this is another testimony
to how there are

00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.270
sudden breakthroughs.

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.430
It should've been obvious.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.810
But somehow people didn't
think of it.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.970
Then, I found one
thing though.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:53.900
I did a search on ngrams on
"eggs in one basket." There's

00:28:53.900 --> 00:29:00.280
an old adage, "Don't put all
your eggs in one basket." And

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:03.310
that's kind of what we're coming
to with Markowitz here.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:12.590
He's got a whole theory of it,
but I found an investment

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:15.060
manual from 1874 --

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:16.310
I can't find it here --

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:22.380
This is from a book, 1874,
about investing.

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:25.330
"There is an old saying that is
inadvisable to put all your

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:28.500
eggs in one basket." So, it was
already in there and he

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.040
says diversify.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.240
OK?

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.030
And then he's done.

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.810
He doesn't tell you, how
do you diversify?

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.020
How do I know what
I should do?

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.390
It just stops there.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:46.710
There was no theory of
risk until 1952.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.870
So, let's think about that.

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.150
You see the concept I have?

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:50.790
You know all the variances.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.070
This isn't a judgment thing.

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:53.390
You know all the covariances.

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:55.090
What should I do?

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.280
The first thing I want to talk
about is the very simple case

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.745
of pure leverage.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.570
Let's go back to 1602.

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:07.240
OK.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.090
And there's only one
stock, that's VOC.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:16.050
OK, and there has to be
something else, otherwise

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:17.350
there's nothing --

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.270
The other thing I'm
going to say is

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.400
there's an interest rate.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:21.510
Riskless interest rate.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:25.270
So, I can invest in, let's say,
Dutch government bonds,

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.490
which are completely safe.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:29.120
Some other person might say
they're not completely safe,

00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:31.840
but they're much
safer than VOC.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.480
VOC was wild.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.360
The price was going all
over the place.

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:40.630
So let's, as an approximation,
say there's an interest rate.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.370
You can borrow and lend
at the interest rate.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:47.810
We'll call the riskless
rate r sub f.

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:48.590
OK?

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.980
And let's say, that's
5% a year.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:51.580
OK?

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.410
We're investing for one year.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.270
So, I can invest at the interest
rate and this is a

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:57.340
boring investment.

00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.990
It's just getting interest.
It's 5%.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.070
But I can also borrow at
the interest rate.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.120
There's a market rate, and
I can borrow at 5%.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.550
You know in practice, I would
probably have to pay a little

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:13.450
bit more as a borrower than I
could get as an investor.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.470
But let's assume that away.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.280
There's just an interest rate,
and anybody who wants to can

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.360
borrow and lend at the
interest rate.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.960
I'll make it 5% just
for a round number.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.550
OK.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:33.810
And let's say VOC, the Dutch
East India Company, has had a

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.940
historic average
return of 20%.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.320
This is a spectacular
investment, right?

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:47.710
But let's say it is, so that's
its mean, its mu, the mean of

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:48.810
the investment.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.290
But let's say, it's really
risky, so the standard

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:56.770
deviation is 40%.

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.020
All right?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.550
So, what can I do?

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.080
Suppose I have only -- this is
the first -- let's do the

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.880
simple problem first, OK?

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:11.110
I have only one asset, VOC,
and I have riskless debt.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.510
I'm going to draw a chart
here showing --

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:29.760
I'm going to do sigma on this
axis, and r on this axis.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:40.040
So, sigma is the standard
deviation of my portfolio, OK?

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:48.835
And r is the expected return
on the portfolio, OK?

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.650
And all I'm going to do is
choose mixtures of the stock

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.290
and the riskless rate.

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:01.770
So, for a couple of points,
I'm going to plot what the

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:05.680
available options are.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.760
I can see right there that I can
invest at 5%, right, the

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.600
riskless rate, and then
I'll have no risk.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.130
So, do you see this?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.860
This is r sub f.

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:22.700
This is 0, OK, and these
are positive numbers.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.600
See what I've plotted here?

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.190
This is just the most
boring investment.

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:30.190
Because there's no risk at
all, and I'm earning 5%.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.540
I can also plot this
one, right?

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.630
So, here is VOC.

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.360
Is this big enough for you
to see back there?

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.270
OK.

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:55.800
So, VOC is up here, and this
is a risk of 40, and a

00:33:55.800 --> 00:33:57.760
standard deviation of 20.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:03.900
Sorry, an expected return of
20 and a risk of 40, right?

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.020
So, those are two points, but
I can do other things, too.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.420
What if I borrowed
money to buy --

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.950
Let's say I have 100 guilders.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:15.900
I'm talking Dutch.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.120
OK, that was the currency of
the time, the guilder.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.950
I'll write it for you.

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.200
Guilder.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.260
OK.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.660
So, I have 100 guilders to
invest. I could put it all on

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:36.460
VOC stock, and I would expect to
get 20 guilders profit, and

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.470
I'd have a standard deviation
of 40 guilders, right?

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.610
But what if I said, I'm
going to actually

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.780
borrow another 100 guilders.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.180
I only own 100 guilders, but
I'm going to borrow another

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:52.220
100 guilders and put
it in VOC stock.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:57.050
That means I'll own 200
guilders of VOC stock.

00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.750
And I'm going to have a
debt of 100 guilders.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:04.630
So, what's my expected
return then?

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:09.000
Well, my expected return
is going to be 35%.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.930
Because, look, I'm owner of 200
guilder's of VOC stock.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:18.380
The expected return is 20%, so
I'm going to get 40 guilders

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.180
out of that.

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.420
But then I have a debt.

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:23.480
I've got to pay five guilders
to my lender.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.480
So, 35 is what I've got.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:29.960
And as a percent of my initial
investment, that's 35%.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.820
So, I've got another
point out here.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:40.850
This is 35 and down
here is 80.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.600
See my standard deviation is
80 guilders now, right?

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.470
Because I have 200 dollars
and the standard

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:49.060
deviation was 40%.

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:50.310
Right?

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:58.800
Here, I am 2-for-1 leveraged.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:06.430
I have $100 but I've put
$200 in the stock.

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.600
OK, it's easy to do.

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:13.390
You know, you could
do this in 1602.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:19.450
So, you can see, obviously, this
is a straight line here.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:22.020
I can do anything along
this straight line.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.380
Here would be putting half of my
money in the riskless asset

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.000
and half into the VOC.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.100
This would be putting 1 1/2,
150 guilders, in VOC and

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.480
borrowing 50 guilders.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.194
See, I can go out as
far as I want.

00:36:46.194 --> 00:36:48.980
Then, there's another
branch to this.

00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:56.570
What if I short 200 guilders
of VOC stock, OK.

00:36:56.570 --> 00:37:02.240
So, I go to the broker, and I
say, I want to sell VOC stock.

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.430
I don't own any.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.090
And the broker would say, all
right, fine, I'll lend you

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.910
some shares and then
you can sell them.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:13.270
But you owe me the shares,
all right?

00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:17.220
So, then I have minus 200
guilders worth of VOC stock.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.340
So, what is my expected
return then?

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.830
And meanwhile, by the way, the
broker says, after you sell

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:26.650
the shares, I will get 200
guilders from the person who

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.230
bought them from you, and I'll
hold that, and I'll pay you

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:30.270
interest on that.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:31.410
OK.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:32.880
So, what do I get?

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.990
I expect to lose 40 guilders,
because I've got $200, 200

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:39.530
guilders of the stock.

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:44.405
But meanwhile, I've got my
original 100 guilders, and now

00:37:44.405 --> 00:37:47.080
I've got another 200, and
they're all there earning

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.880
interest at 5%.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.460
So, I will get 15 guilders.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:58.150
So, the expected return is
15 minus 40, or minus 25.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.870
So, that's this point
down here.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:04.180
But you can see that you can
also do anywhere you

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:06.590
like on that line.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:10.050
So, what we have here is
a broken straight line.

00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:12.110
I can get anything
I want, right?

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.800
This is kind of obvious
right now.

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.700
Anywhere I want on that line, on
that broken straight line.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.860
And I can do that.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.250
So, here's where you got saying,
what is the optimal

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.910
portfolio anyway?

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:33.340
I can get any return I want.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:37.510
You know, my client, who's
asking me to invest, says, I

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.580
want 100% return, expected.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:41.510
You say, got it.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.660
I'm no genius, right?

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.470
I'm just doing the most
obvious thing.

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.120
Anyone who wants a 100%
return can get it.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.370
I'm just going to leverage.

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:56.090
So, then I create
an investment.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:59.340
If I have an investment company
that merely buys VOC

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.810
stock and leverages it, my
investment company can have

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:05.920
any expected return
that you want.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.660
So, this is what Markowitz
was wondering about.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.250
What does it mean to have the
optimal investment anyway?

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:15.680
And the core thing that he
talked about in 1952 is, there

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.860
is no best investment.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.745
There's only a trade-off between
risk and return.

00:39:20.745 --> 00:39:24.210
And we have to think about
the best trade-off.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:28.270
In this case, I've shown
the trade-off here.

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:29.630
This is what you can get.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.350
Any one of those points
is available.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:38.690
And so, anyone who wants to
invest with you has to choose

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:39.780
between risk and return.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:45.910
There's no optimal portfolio
in that fundamental sense.

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:49.430
It's a matter of an
optimal trade-off.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:53.610
And, you know, nobody knew
that before 1952.

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.390
So, let me just show
formally this --

00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:58.040
what I just did on
the blackboard.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.630
I've switched to dollars
from guilders.

00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:07.420
Now we're in the USA.

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:12.470
And so, put x dollars in a risky
asset, 1 minus x dollars

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:15.350
in the riskless asset.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.350
The expected value of the return
on the portfolio is r.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.370
That's equal to x r1 plus 1
minus x times rf, all right?

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.430
It's linear, that's
because that's how

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:28.660
expected values work.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.530
The variance is x squared
times the

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.720
variance of the return.

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.150
And so, if I want to write the
portfolio standard deviation

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:47.520
as a function of the expected
return, I solve for x.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.980
Taking this equation for x,
solve for x in terms of r.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.290
So, x equals r minus rf
all over r1 minus rf.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:41:00.590
And then, I substitute that
in to this equation.

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:04.630
Well, I want to take the square
root of it, because

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.540
this is sigma squared.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.730
And so, I've got sigma equals
r minus rf times r1 minus rf

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:11.890
[correction: this fraction is
multiplied by the standard

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:11.990
deviation of portfolio
return 1].

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:14.850
Well actually, I have these
absolute value marks.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.400
If that's negative, I switch
sign and make it positive.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:25.030
So, that gives the formula for
this broken straight line

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:26.290
right here.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.920
So that's pretty simple.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.396
That's the expected value
[correction: portfolio

00:41:33.396 --> 00:41:34.646
standard deviation].

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:51.190
So now, I want to move ahead,
move on from this

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:54.540
simple idea to --

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.350
we haven't really gotten fully
into Markowitz yet.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.020
Because this is a very
simple story.

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.260
By the way, this broken straight
line is what we call

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.770
a degenerate case
of a hyperbola.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:15.013
You know the, remember in math,
hyperbola is a curve, a

00:42:15.013 --> 00:42:17.320
certain mathematical curve.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.390
And we're seeing a hyperbola
here, but I'm going to show

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:23.500
you other hyperbolas
in a minute.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.160
What Markowitz really said --
well OK, this is simple.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:29.340
This is all, just pure leverage
is a simple thing to

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:31.760
understand.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.060
By the way, it's also called
gearing in the United Kingdom.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.890
But let's think about now --

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:48.320
suppose I have more than
one risky asset.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.190
Let's get past the year 1602.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:43:02.780
And let's think about assets
in a more modern context.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.700
I want to move to another
example, which

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.040
is two risky assets.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.610
We've moved past 1602 and
now we have two stocks.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.950
And for the moment, I'm going
to forget about leverage.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:24.970
And let's just say you can put
x1 in the first risky asset,

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.520
that's stock number one.

00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:30.760
And I can put 1 minus x1 in
the second risky asset.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.570
That's stock number two.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.900
OK?

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.710
So, what do I get here?

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:44.330
The portfolio expected return is
just the linear combination

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.440
of the two expected returns.

00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:51.190
So, r1 is the expected return on
the first stock, and r2 is

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.010
the expected return on
the second stock.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:58.420
Well actually, I'm assuming
you have $1 to

00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.840
invest in this example.

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:00.550
I'm sorry.

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:03.350
I was assuming you had 100
guilders over there.

00:44:03.350 --> 00:44:05.870
Now, I just made it $1.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.790
Unrealistically small amount,
but I just wanted a nice

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:10.080
number, OK?

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.260
So, let's say $1 is 100
guilders, and then I haven't

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.810
changed anything.

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.980
OK.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.990
So, I start out with $1, so if
I put x1 dollars in the first

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.660
one, I have 1 minus x1 left
for the other one.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.960
So it's very simple.

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:31.020
And this is the formula for the
variance of the portfolio,

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.160
which we saw --

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.020
essentially we saw that
in the second lecture.

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.900
So, what I can do is, go through
the same sort of

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.010
exercise I did there with two
risky assets, all right?

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.320
And so, what I want to
do is, draw a curve

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.570
something like this.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:59.010
But I'll solve for x1 in terms
of r, just like I did for the

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:00.550
riskless asset.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:04.830
And I'll plug it into the
equation for the variance.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.070
I'll have to take the square
root of that, and I

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:11.170
can plot that, OK?

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.280
And you might think it would
look something like that.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.420
Well, it's not going to look
exactly like that, because

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.500
it's risky.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.000
Something's risky.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.880
So, I did that.

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.730
And incidentally on your problem
set, you're going to

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:25.700
have to think about
issues like this.

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:31.340
But what I did is, I took data
on the average return for the

00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.275
U.S. stock market, as
measured by the S&amp;P

00:45:33.275 --> 00:45:38.040
500, and the variance.

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:40.830
And then, the alternate
investment I took was 10-year

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:43.880
treasuries for the United
States government.

00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.900
Long-term, because they're
10 years, but we're only

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:47.520
investing for one year.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.180
So, they're risky, because the
market price goes up and down.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.660
They're not riskless.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.720
I call those bonds.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.920
There's other kinds of bonds.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.360
And I computed the relationship
between the

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.890
standard deviation of the
portfolio and the expected

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.530
return, just as I showed you.

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:18.960
Again, using data from
1983 to 2006.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.940
And it kind of looks like
this curve, doesn't it?

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:28.370
Except, this is a degenerate
parabola, but

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.620
it looks like this.

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:33.670
I'm sorry, parabola.

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:34.410
I said it wrong.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:35.660
Hyperbola.

00:46:37.450 --> 00:46:38.520
You know how hyperbola --

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.000
remember this from math?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.100
Hyperbolas, well they look like
that, and they approach

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:51.270
asymptotes, which are
straight lines.

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:57.620
So, here is the hyperbola
for stocks and bonds.

00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:03.860
So, just as I had a point here
which represented 100% VOC, I

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:05.440
can have over here
a point which

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.080
represents 100% U.S. stocks.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.330
OK?

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.120
And I can take another
point which is 100%

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.830
bonds, that's here.

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.350
This point is 25% stock,
75% bonds.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:22.600
This point is 50% stock,
50% bonds.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.300
OK?

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:27.800
This is the choice set that I
as an investor have between

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.050
stocks and bonds.

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.260
So, is that clear?

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.250
You see, all these are
different portfolios.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.790
If you're just going to do
stocks and bonds and nothing

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:48.790
else, what you choose to do
depends on your taste, on your

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.770
risk tolerance.

00:47:49.770 --> 00:47:52.810
I could go 100% stocks,
but I'm going to

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:53.690
have a lot of risk.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:57.310
I'm going to have a nice
expected return, it looks like

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.530
it's about 13%, 14%.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:01.960
But I'm going to have
a high variance.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.530
Looks like it's about 18%.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.240
This is the S&amp;P 500
stock market.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.850
And so, it has a lot
of variance.

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:13.770
I could be safe, and I could
go all in bonds.

00:48:13.770 --> 00:48:15.550
I could be here.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.460
Then I'd have, you know, a
lower, much lower return, but

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.390
I'd have a lower variance.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:22.640
So, what should I do?

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.110
Well, what do you
learn from it?

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.530
First of all, you learn there
isn't any single optimal

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:32.920
portfolio, but there
is something.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:36.250
Let's talk about being
100% bond investor.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:37.030
What do you think of that?

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.100
Is that a good idea?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.100
You get this point right here.

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:47.560
Well, you definitely should not
be a 100% bond investor.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:49.500
That's one thing we
just learned.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:50.660
Why's that?

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:55.630
Because if I go up here, I have
no more -- see that's the

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:59.710
same standard deviation, the
same risk, but I have higher

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:02.970
return, right?

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:06.240
Higher expected return.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.260
So, what did we just learn?

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:09.670
We learned that if you just stay
in this space of stocks

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.800
and bonds, maybe you could be
100% stock investor, but never

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.660
in a million years should you
ever even think of being 100%

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:18.500
bond investor.

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.140
OK, because, look, it's
just simple math.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.140
I can figure it out.

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.950
I can figure out that I
get a higher expected

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.130
return and no more risk.

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.720
So, this is lesson number one
that Markowitz showed us.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:32.790
Amazing.

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.420
It's so simple and
obvious, right?

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.450
It's not so simple, because, at
the time Markowitz wrote,

00:49:39.450 --> 00:49:43.660
Yale University was probably
100% bond investor,

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:44.920
believe it or not.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:49.050
They couldn't figure it
out in those days.

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:52.170
So, we've made progress.

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:54.740
That's why I think Markowitz is
among the most deserving of

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.609
the Nobel Prize winners
in economics.

00:49:56.609 --> 00:49:57.859
This is really basic.

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.900
It actually intrigues me.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.250
I don't know how much you like
math, but going back to my

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:06.730
childhood I was interested
in geometry.

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:14.580
These simple mathematical
curiosities like hyperbolas

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:17.010
are just fascinating to me.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:22.510
It goes back to Apollonius of
Perga, writing in around 200

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.530
BC, wrote a book on
conic sections.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:32.230
And he invented the words
hyperbola, parabola, ellipse.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.910
So, I was thinking of looking
back at his book.

00:50:34.910 --> 00:50:36.510
I think it still survives.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.360
And see what it says
about finance.

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:42.400
But I can be sure he had no
idea that his theory would

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:43.680
apply to finance.

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.830
I wish I could go back in a time
machine and talk to him.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:50.810
He would be so happy to know
that his theory of conic

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:51.390
sections --

00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:54.540
It, you know, it ended up
applied to astronomy by Kepler

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.460
and Newton.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.760
And now it hits into finance.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.870
Isn't it amazing how there's
a unity of thought?

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.200
And this simple diagram
has just taught us

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.740
something about investing.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.220
That's not obvious.

00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:10.200
Not obvious until you
think about it.

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:12.600
I've just told you, never
invest only in bonds.

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:17.740
But it doesn't tell you
how much stocks

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:19.650
and how much bonds.

00:51:19.650 --> 00:51:24.130
You know, once you're above this
point, it seems to be a

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:25.240
matter of taste.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:31.130
There isn't any single decision
that you can make.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:37.340
So, I want to move to a more
complicated world where we

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:39.320
have three assets.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:40.150
OK.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:43.910
We're starting from -- we had
one risky asset, then we had

00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:46.130
two, now let's go
even further.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:49.110
Let's say three risky assets.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:54.540
Well, the expected return
is the same, it's

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:55.410
the weighted average.

00:51:55.410 --> 00:52:00.990
Now we have three weights,
x1, x2, and x3, and they

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:02.780
have to sum to $1.

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.020
I could have written x3 as
1 minus x1 minus x2.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.515
I wrote it differently here.

00:52:08.515 --> 00:52:11.340
It looked messy to write
it the other way.

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:15.270
And this is the formula for
the portfolio variance.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.320
It's the x1 squared, times the
variance of the return on the

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.250
first risky asset, plus x2
squared, times the variance of

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:25.450
the return on the second risky
asset, plus x3 squared, times

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:28.470
the variance of the return
on the third risky asset.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:31.240
And then you have three more
terms representing

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.590
covariances.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.230
You have to take account of the
covariances of the assets.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:39.270
Because if they move together,
if they all go in the same

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.070
direction at the same time,
that's going to make your

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:44.910
portfolio riskier.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:47.300
And so, that's the portfolio
variance.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.590
And the portfolio expected
return is just --

00:52:50.590 --> 00:52:51.470
why didn't I write it there?

00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:56.630
It's x1r1 plus x2r2 plus
x3r3, where the sum of

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:00.440
the x's is 1, $1.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:05.430
So, it's something that you can
do to calculate what is

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:08.580
the optimal portfolio.

00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:12.480
So, I decided to add a third
asset to my diagram.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.480
The pink line up here
is the same.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:19.600
We call that an Efficient
Portfolio Frontier.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:23.170
I have that in the title
of the slide,

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.270
for stocks and bonds.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:26.830
That's the pink line here.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.400
But I've added the Efficient
Portfolio

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:35.080
Frontier for three assets.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.080
Stocks, bonds, and oil.

00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:43.340
Oil is an important investment,
because our

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:44.890
economy runs on it.

00:53:44.890 --> 00:53:48.240
And the total value of oil in
the ground is comparable to

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:50.680
the value of the stock
markets of the world.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.920
It's big and important.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.170
So, let's put that in.

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:02.180
And what I have actually here
is the minimum variance

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:11.350
mixture for any given expected
return for the three assets.

00:54:11.350 --> 00:54:14.920
And you can see that it's
possible, when you add a third

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.720
asset, oil, to bring the
Efficient Portfolio Frontier

00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:21.590
to the left.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:23.520
OK?

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.080
Because we've got
another asset.

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.320
And it's also paying
a good return.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.020
And it's not correlated.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:33.080
Oil doesn't correlate very much
with the stock market.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:37.010
So, we're spreading the risk
out over more assets.

00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:40.414
We're putting more eggs
in our basket.

00:54:40.414 --> 00:54:41.070
[Correction: We are providing
more baskets for the eggs.]

00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.190
OK?

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:53.260
And so, we have a better
choice set now, right?

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.810
We can pick any point
on that blue line.

00:54:56.810 --> 00:54:59.660
And so, we shouldn't just
have stocks and bonds.

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:04.300
We've learned we should have
stocks, bonds, and oil.

00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:07.810
We're leading toward a
fundamental insight, which is

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:11.280
due to Markowitz, which is,
the more the merrier.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:15.050
The more different kinds of
assets you can put in, the

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:18.770
lower you can get the standard
deviation of your return, for

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:22.950
any given expected return.

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.080
So, the better off you are.

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:27.090
This is diversification.

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:32.190
So, while diversification was
applauded in the nineteenth

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:36.180
century, no one had ever done
the math like this before.

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:41.020
And now we can see, when you do
the math, you want to have

00:55:41.020 --> 00:55:43.360
all three in your portfolio.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.280
And yet people don't
know that.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:49.990
They don't, there's an emotional
resistance to this

00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:51.610
implication.

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:57.146
I once went to the government
of Norway.

00:55:57.146 --> 00:56:01.950
I gave a talk at their Norges
Bank, which is the central

00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:03.760
bank of Norway.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.370
I told them in my talk, I
calculate that Norway has

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:13.320
something like 70% of its
portfolio in oil.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:15.450
I don't remember the exact
number, but it was something

00:56:15.450 --> 00:56:16.370
close to that.

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:18.870
Why do they have
so much in oil?

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:22.160
Well, because they have
the North Sea Oil.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:27.540
And so, I asked them at the
bank, don't you realize, where

00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:31.310
are you on this portfolio?

00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:33.360
You're not on the frontier.

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:37.000
What Norway should be doing is
something like 15%, they could

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.250
pick this point right, that
would be reasonable.

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:44.050
15% oil, 53% stocks, 32% bonds,
which would give them

00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:45.600
that point.

00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.710
Or they could pick this one.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:48.900
I have a point labeled
up here.

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:53.850
That's 21% oil, 79%
stocks, no bonds.

00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:55.450
All right, those are all
choices depending

00:56:55.450 --> 00:56:56.670
on your risk tolerance.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:57:00.210
But they're not going to
just pick 100% oil.

00:57:00.210 --> 00:57:05.180
That would be way over here,
much higher risk.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:06.380
So, I asked them about that.

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:08.380
Why do you do this?

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.380
And I don't know if I got a
good answer from them, but

00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:16.320
basically it was, well, we don't
want to sell the oil,

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.960
because it's our national
heritage, you know, we own it.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.620
And I said, well you don't have
to sell it, you can just

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.110
do a derivative transaction.

00:57:23.110 --> 00:57:25.440
You can short the futures
market for oil

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.110
and reduce your exposure.

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:31.370
And then, they said, well, some
people have mentioned

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.890
that, but its politically
difficult.

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.180
So, they're not doing it.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:37.140
Maybe next year.

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.620
Maybe the next government
will do that.

00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:42.300
So, they still aren't
there yet.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.540
They're not managing
their risks well.

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.620
So, it's a powerful and
important thing, because if

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:52.960
the market for oil collapses,
Norway is in big trouble.

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.730
They're not diversifying
enough.

00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:57.320
I don't mean to put them down.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:59.730
They're smart people, but
like in any country --

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:01.450
I did the same thing
with Mexico.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:03.440
I went to the Banco de Mexico.

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:06.220
And I talked to Guillermo
Ortiz when he

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.230
was director of it.

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:09.650
Same thing in Mexico.

00:58:09.650 --> 00:58:13.400
It's not as dependent on oil,
not as dependent on

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:14.975
oil as Norway is.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:22.050
It's not so obvious
for Mexico.

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:24.180
But it is politics
that came in.

00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:27.130
The question of, are you really
saying Mexico should go

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:31.150
into the futures market and take
a massive short-position

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:34.750
of billions of dollars of oil?

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:37.310
Again, it was like, this
isn't reality.

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:39.970
We're not going to do that.

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:44.410
But I tried to make the point.

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:49.520
Now, another thing is, I have
shown here three assets.

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.340
The pink line is irrelevant once
we realize we have three

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:54.610
assets, we have stocks,
bonds, and oil.

00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:56.150
So, you should choose
on this curve.

00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:58.840
And a person should never
take down here, even

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.090
though that's possible.

00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:05.550
In other words, you could say,
what portfolio would give me

00:59:05.550 --> 00:59:09.610
9% return with the least risk?

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.680
Well it turns out
it's 100% bonds.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.610
But I just told you, never do
100% bonds, because you can go

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:18.110
up to this point, all right?

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.430
So, you never do down here.

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.320
So, the Efficient Portfolio
Frontier is really the part of

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.990
the hyperbola that's above
the minimum variance.

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:27.240
And you don't want
to do minimum

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:28.400
variance either, right?

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.330
This is the lowest possible
risk portfolio.

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:35.880
You can't get down to
zero risk if all of

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.590
your assets are risky.

00:59:37.590 --> 00:59:40.550
So, you're stuck here.

00:59:40.550 --> 00:59:43.820
That's not necessarily the best
thing, because people

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:44.850
allow some risk.

00:59:44.850 --> 00:59:47.720
This is having the minimum risk,
but I can get my return

00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:49.850
up much higher without
taking much risk, so

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:51.880
I'd probably do that.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.890
OK.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:54.710
Now, I can do this with more
than three assets.

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:57.820
I can do it with 1,000 assets,
now that we have computers.

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:02.520
Back in 1952, I erased it, but I
had 1952 here, Markowitz had

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.580
do it all by hand.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.720
But now that we have computers,
it's so easy.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.430
You know, there are all kinds of
programs. In fact, on your

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:12.470
problem set, we have Wolfram
Alpha, which will do all these

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:17.480
calculations for you
for its own data.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.320
These are easy to do now.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.360
But what I want to do now is
add the riskless asset.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:29.210
So, what we've done, the blue
line takes three risky assets.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:32.660
It looks only at assets with
a standard deviation

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.190
greater than zero.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:37.670
Now I want to do the optimal
portfolio when

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:40.180
there are four assets.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:44.180
I've got stocks, bonds,
oil, all risky.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.890
And now I have the thing that
isn't risky, would be your

01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:48.720
1-year governments.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:48.930
Right?

01:00:48.930 --> 01:00:51.930
It's not risky, because
the maturity matches

01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:53.660
my investment horizon.

01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:55.920
I know exactly what
I'm going to get.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:59.580
It's 5%, let's say.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:06.030
So, what can I do investing
in these for assets?

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:09.900
Well, here it goes back to what
I did over here with this

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.640
simple diagram.

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:15.750
I can pick any portfolio on
the Efficient Portfolio

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:19.940
Frontier and consider that as
if that were VOC, right?

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:25.260
And then, I can compute just
how leverage allows me to

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:31.080
combine that with the riskless
asset and that portfolio.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.890
So, I can pick a point, like
I can pick this point here.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:39.210
And then, I could achieve, by
combining that portfolio,

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:43.590
which is 15% oil, 53% stocks,
and 32% bonds --

01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:48.910
I could combine that with any
amount of risky debt.

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:52.280
And I would get a straight
line going between --

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:55.040
actually, this diagram doesn't
show zero, I should have maybe

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.250
done it differently --
but between 5% --

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:01.960
So, actually that point
right here.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.090
You can do it on this diagram.

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:08.270
That point here is
like 12% expected

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.390
return and 8% variance.

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:14.160
So, it would be some --

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.750
well, it would be here, except
this would be 12% and this

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:19.260
would be 8%.

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:21.090
I can pick any point.

01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:22.930
And this would be 5%.

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:26.270
Any point along the straight
line connecting those points

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:28.700
is possible.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.350
So, what do I want to do?

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.400
I want to get the highest
expected return for any

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.800
standard deviation.

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:41.890
I want to take a line that goes
through 5% on the y-axis

01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:44.430
and is as high as possible.

01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:50.150
So, I'm taking a point right
over here, at 5%, and trying

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.300
to get as high as I can.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:56.090
It turns out then, that I want
to pick the point which has a

01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:01.340
tangency with the Efficient
Portfolio Frontier.

01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:07.640
And so, that means the highest
straight line that touches the

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.690
Efficient Portfolio Frontier.

01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:12.590
And so, now I can achieve
any point on that line.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:19.780
And that's again Markowitz's
insight.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:25.190
So, if I were to pick that
point, I would be --

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.720
What does it look like?

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:27.050
I don't have it indicated.

01:03:27.050 --> 01:03:33.730
Probably something like 11% oil,
30% stocks, 50% bonds,

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:37.700
something like that,
it doesn't add up.

01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:39.726
And that would be holding
no debt, right?

01:03:39.726 --> 01:03:39.960
[Clarification: No debt, in
the sense of shorting the

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.340
risk-free rate.]

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:45.400
But I could get even higher
returns, if my client wants

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.210
that, by leveraging.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:51.320
I would borrow and buy even more
of this risky portfolio.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:55.660
So, this portfolio here is
called the Tangency Portfolio.

01:03:55.660 --> 01:04:03.820
And what Markowitz's theory
shows is that, once you add

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.270
the risky asset
[correction: riskless asset],

01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:07.610
the relevant Efficient Portfolio
Frontier is now

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:10.090
really this tangency line.

01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:16.150
And so, I want to do a mixture
of the riskless asset and the

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:22.150
Tangency Portfolio that
accords with my risk

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:23.720
preferences.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:29.760
But I don't want to ever just
move to one of these other

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.240
portfolios.

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.750
You see, these other portfolios,
like 15% oil, 53%

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:37.990
stock, 32% bonds, is dominated,
has a higher

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.860
expected return for the same
risk, by a portfolio of the

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:45.955
Tangency Portfolio, leveraged up
a little bit by borrowing.

01:04:55.470 --> 01:04:57.710
I don't know if it was clear in
Markowitz's paper, but it

01:04:57.710 --> 01:04:59.960
became clear soon after.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:02.730
There really is, in a sense,
an optimal portfolio.

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.240
It's the Tangency Portfolio.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:15.200
Because everyone wants to invest
on this line, and any

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.720
point on this line is a mixture
of the riskless asset

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.710
and the Tangency Portfolio.

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:26.880
And so, everyone wants to invest
in the same portfolio.

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:30.405
So, there is an optimal
portfolio, in a sense.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:37.870
It's in a sense that everybody
wants to do the same risky

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.610
investments.

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:42.980
People will differ in their risk
preferences, and so some

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:47.460
of them will want to do a
riskier, a more leveraged

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.940
version, and some of them will
do a less leveraged version of

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:59.610
the Tangency Portfolio, but
everyone wants to do the

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:00.860
Tangency Portfolio.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:11.180
So, that is the key idea of
Markowitz's portfolio

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:12.290
management.

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:16.260
And it's been expressed
by some as

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:18.285
the Mutual Fund Theorem.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.950
First of all, I have to just to
define for you, what is a

01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:31.910
mutual fund?

01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:33.500
You may not know that.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:38.210
A mutual fund is a certain kind
of investment company

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:41.680
aimed at a retail audience.

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.870
They could have just called this
the investment company

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:45.400
theorem, but history --

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:47.730
I can't tell you the history
of thought on this.

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:58.120
A mutual fund is a certain kind
of investment company

01:06:58.120 --> 01:06:59.190
that is mutual.

01:06:59.190 --> 01:07:04.080
That means that the owners of
the shares in the fund are --

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.090
there's no other owners.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:06.406
There's just one class
of investors.

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:10.880
You're all equal,
so it's mutual.

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:11.990
But that's irrelevant to you.

01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:16.020
The idea is that, all we need
is one mutual fund.

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:20.700
There's thousands of mutual
funds to serve investors.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.210
Because I had that everyone
is investing in

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:24.870
the Tangency Portfolio.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:26.620
So, they should call
their fund the

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:28.660
Tangency Portfolio fund.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:34.320
And our fund is the optimal mix
of stock, bonds, oil and

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:37.090
whatever else.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:40.970
And then, you don't necessarily
want to own only

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:46.830
that mutual fund, but you want
to own mixtures of that mutual

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.260
fund and the riskless asset.

01:07:49.260 --> 01:07:55.940
So, you only need one
investment company.

01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:57.740
See, I told you this story.

01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.050
I said, imagine that you were
mathematically inclined, and

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:01.860
you have all the statistics,
and you're going

01:08:01.860 --> 01:08:02.600
to figure it out.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:04.200
What's the best thing to do?

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.490
We've just figured it out.

01:08:05.490 --> 01:08:07.700
I haven't gone through
all the math details.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.220
There is a best thing to do.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.850
You should offer, as your
investment product, the

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.920
Tangency Portfolio.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:17.950
And that's it.

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:20.100
Once you've figured it out,
there's nothing more to do.

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.640
There's no need to hire any
more finance people.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.850
You've figured it
out, according

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.610
to Markowitz's theory.

01:08:26.610 --> 01:08:28.690
And all the investors in
the world will just

01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:30.330
invest in this one.

01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:31.250
And that's it.

01:08:31.250 --> 01:08:32.890
Case closed.

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:36.430
We don't need thousands
of mutual funds.

01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:40.590
Under the assumptions of
Markowitz, which is that we're

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:43.610
agreed on the variances, and
covariances, and expected

01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:48.180
returns, there's a single
optimal risky portfolio.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.620
And then the instructions to
investors are very simple.

01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:55.740
All you need is two assets
in your portfolio.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:09:00.560
The mutual fund that owns the
Tangency Portfolio, and

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.910
whatever amount of
debt you want.

01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.640
So, if you're footloose and
fancy free, you can even

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.780
leverage it.

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:11.140
You can borrow and do
2-to-1, 3-to-1,

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.480
it's up to your tastes.

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.830
But you don't need to look
at anything other

01:09:15.830 --> 01:09:19.350
than the mutual fund.

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:21.325
So, that's an important
insight.

01:09:24.210 --> 01:09:27.240
And what it means then --

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.450
that leads to something else.

01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.990
Markowitz didn't
get this idea.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:32.500
It came out later.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.540
Someone was thinking, if
everyone should be investing

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:41.230
in the same portfolio, it
doesn't add up unless that

01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:46.130
that portfolio is equal to the
total assets out there in the

01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:49.850
world, right?

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:54.730
If there's twice as much oil as
there is stock, then there

01:09:54.730 --> 01:09:57.790
has to be twice as much
oil as stock in

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:00.900
the Tangency Portfolio.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.060
Otherwise, it doesn't
add up, right?

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:04.830
Everyone has to own
everything.

01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:07.000
Supply and demand
have to equal.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:13.320
So it means, the Mutual Fund
Theory implies that the market

01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:25.880
portfolio equals the Tangency
Portfolio, OK.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.850
And now I've pretty much
finished the theory.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:39.070
I should say, it implies, if
investors follow this model

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.590
that we're having.

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:42.210
That they all want to --

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:43.240
that Markowitz's model --

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.780
If all investors think like
Markowitz says, they all want

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.550
to do the same thing.

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:50.990
They all want to invest in
the same best portfolio.

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:52.650
So, that has to be proportional

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:55.070
to the market portfolio.

01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:58.910
So, the Tangency Portfolio
equals the market portfolio.

01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:01.970
So, I was saying earlier, why
is it that everyone doesn't

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:04.810
invest in VOC stock?

01:11:04.810 --> 01:11:06.100
How does it add up, right?

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:11.180
If VOC stock is just better than
something else, then that

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.850
suggests everyone wants to put
all their money in VOC stock.

01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:16.010
But we're realizing,
they don't.

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:17.470
Because they're concerned
about it.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:20.730
They see this trade-off between
risk and return, and

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:25.170
they want to hold some
proportion of VOC stock and

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:27.100
the riskless asset.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.410
It has to add up, so that the
market is cleared and all the

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:31.890
VOC stock is owned.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.560
And more generally, if there
are many assets, all the

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.590
assets have to end up
owned by someone.

01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:45.810
So, the cardinal implication
of this theory is that the

01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.260
market portfolio, which is
everything that's out there in

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:51.390
the world to invest in, has
to be proportional to the

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:52.154
Tangency Portfolio [correction:
has to be equal

01:11:52.154 --> 01:11:53.590
to the Tangency Portfolio].

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:55.940
And so, one of the
implications is,

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.550
if that's true --

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:00.855
and I have just a couple
more slides here.

01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:08.490
Now it's called the
Capital Asset

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.990
Pricing Model in finance.

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:16.670
So, that's Capital Asset --

01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:21.630
which is a pricing model, which
was not invented by

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:35.160
Markowitz, but was invented by
Sharpe and Lintner somewhat

01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.230
shortly after Markowitz.

01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:41.260
The Capital Asset
Pricing Model --

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.890
and I'm not going to derive
this equation.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:46.640
But it says the expected return
on any asset, the i-th

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:51.560
asset, equals the risk free
rate, plus the beta of that

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.570
asset times the difference
between the expected return on

01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.075
the market and the expected
return on the riskless asset.

01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:04.750
I was just going to try to
explain this intuitively, and

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.520
then I'll be done.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:09.490
I have one more slide about
the Sharpe ratio.

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:12.670
But the intuitive idea -- let me
just say, everything should

01:13:12.670 --> 01:13:13.800
have a very simple
explanation.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.450
And the intuitive idea is this:
Starting from Markowitz,

01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:21.070
we got an understanding
of what risk is.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:24.160
People didn't clearly
appreciate that.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.770
People used to think
that risk was

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.230
uncertainty, right, in finance.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.850
If a stock has a lot of
uncertainty, that uncertainty

01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:34.970
means that it's a dangerous
stock, and people will demand

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:37.330
a high expected return,
otherwise they

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:38.770
won't hold the stuff.

01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:41.980
But the CAPM says no, people
don't care about the

01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.560
uncertainty of the stock.

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.850
Because if it's one stock out
of many, they'll put it in

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:49.130
their portfolio, and if it's
independent of everything

01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:53.050
else, it all gets averaged
out, and so, who cares?

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:55.640
So, people don't care
about variance.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.250
Well, what is it that
people care about?

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:01.630
People care about covariance.

01:14:01.630 --> 01:14:05.320
This is the basic insight that
followed from Markowitz.

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.430
People care about how much a
stock moves with the market,

01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:12.800
because that's what costs
me something.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:15.990
I don't care, I can own a
million little stocks that all

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:17.310
have independent risk.

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:19.530
It all averages out, doesn't
mean anything to me.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:22.390
I'll put them in tiny quantities
in my portfolio.

01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:25.840
But if they correlate with the
market, I can't get rid of the

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.740
risk, because it's the
big picture risk.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:31.280
That's what insurance companies,
that's what

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:32.180
everyone cares about.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.500
It's this market risk.

01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.020
The big risk.

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:38.980
You only care about how much a
stock correlates with the big

01:14:38.980 --> 01:14:41.180
picture in its risk.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.260
So, that's measured by beta.

01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.440
The beta is the regression --

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.480
the slope coefficient, when you
regress the return on the

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:50.920
i-th asset on the return
of the market.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.880
So, high beta stocks are stocks

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.220
that go with the market.

01:14:56.220 --> 01:15:01.360
We found out that Apple has a
beta of 1.5, or roughly that.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.820
That means, they respond
in an exaggerated way.

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:08.160
It's not 1, it's greater than
1, they more than move with

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.430
the market.

01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:14.290
And so, investors will demand
a higher return on Apple

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:18.530
stock, because its beta is
greater than for other stocks.

01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:21.220
That's the core idea
that underlies it.

01:15:21.220 --> 01:15:23.250
Do you see that intuitively?

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:25.620
You have to change your
idea of what risk is.

01:15:25.620 --> 01:15:27.150
Risk is covariance.

01:15:27.150 --> 01:15:30.645
It's co-movements.

01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:32.950
I have just one more
slide here.

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:38.320
It's named after William Sharpe,
who is the inventor,

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.565
with Lintner, of the Capital
Asset Pricing Model.

01:15:40.565 --> 01:15:44.810
The Sharpe ratio is, for any
portfolio, the average return

01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:48.440
on the portfolio minus the
risk-free rate, divided by the

01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:51.510
standard deviation
of the portfolio.

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:57.890
And if you take the CAPM model,
the Sharpe ratio is

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:01.720
constant along the
tangency line.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:06.610
This is a way of correcting the
average return from some

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.690
investment for leverage.

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:10.820
The idea is --

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:14.330
Some companies used to
advertise, we've had a 15%

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.670
average return, and then
investors would

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:18.190
say, but wait a minute.

01:16:18.190 --> 01:16:20.030
You didn't tell me what
your leverage is.

01:16:20.030 --> 01:16:22.730
That's the first thing you
should learn from this course.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:27.000
Someone advertises that they had
15% return, you say, ha, I

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.120
want to know what your
leverage was.

01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:31.120
I want to know --

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:34.710
you were just leveraging it up
and taking big risks, and on

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.120
average you'll do well,
but it's risky.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.330
So, this is the correction
you make.

01:16:39.330 --> 01:16:40.660
How do you correct
for leverage?

01:16:40.660 --> 01:16:45.700
You might say, well I want to
look at what fraction of the

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:48.770
investment portfolio is in the
risky asset, and what fraction

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.400
is in the riskless asset.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:53.860
But it's not so easy to do that,
because the company can

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.520
cover up its tracks.

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:58.960
It can invest in a company
that's leveraged, right?

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.700
And so, you have to go one
step further and undo the

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.000
leverage for that company.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.520
It's hard to do that.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.060
But the easy thing to do is
just calculate the Sharpe

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.060
ratio for the investment
company.

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:12.550
So, if some guy is investing and
is claiming to have done

01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:18.090
15% of return per year on his
portfolio, well, I'm going to

01:17:18.090 --> 01:17:20.150
look at the standard deviation
of the portfolio.

01:17:20.150 --> 01:17:22.860
That's evidence of how leveraged
this guy was.

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:24.290
And I compute the
Sharpe ratio.

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:27.800
And unless it's bigger than the
Sharpe ratio for the, you

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.195
know, the typical stock,
I'm not impressed.

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:36.510
Anyway, so I think, I've come
to the end of this lecture.

01:17:36.510 --> 01:17:39.250
So, what you should have gotten
from this lecture is a

01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:46.850
concept of risk return
trade-off, a concept of

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:49.750
optimal portfolio as being
something subtle and related

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.900
to Apollonius of Perga
in difficult ways.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.690
But there's also very simple
things about how to evaluate

01:17:55.690 --> 01:17:57.760
portfolios and portfolio
managers that

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.010
comes out of this.

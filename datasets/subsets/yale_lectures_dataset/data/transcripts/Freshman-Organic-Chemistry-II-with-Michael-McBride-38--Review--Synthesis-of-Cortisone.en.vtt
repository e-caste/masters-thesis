00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:03.967
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: Well, from
the happy hubbub, I gather

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:08.167
you're as eager as I am
to get this over.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:10.900
So the last lecture is a review
of what we've done

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.700
before, actually.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.400
But it's focused on synthetic
chemistry.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.267
In particular, the synthesis
of cortisone, which is a

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.767
natural product.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:22.000
Cortisone looks like this.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.667
It's one of these steroids
which, remember, have three

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.167
six-membered rings, then a
five-membered ring, and

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.600
various alcohols and
ketones and so on.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:37.100
And in fact, this lecture
originated with a book called

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.800
Advanced Organic Chemistry,
although I've used it so much

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.833
that you can't tell it from the
spine anymore, that was

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:47.267
written in 1961 when I was
taking organic chemistry by

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:52.267
Louis Fieser at Harvard, who was
the person I was having at

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:54.300
that time for this course.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.067
He was a very good synthetic
organic chemist, and he worked

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:00.667
a lot on steroids.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:05.567
In fact, in 1936, he wrote this
book, which is called

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.433
Chemistry of Natural Products
Related to Phenanthrene.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:11.933
Phenanthrene three is a thing
like three benzene rings.

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:13.233
Bing, bing, bing.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.367
So you see, steroids are related
to phenanthrene, so

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.100
that's what this
book was about.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.000
He also was a stylish guy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.500
Before I got there, it was
reported that he walked around

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.900
with a gold headed cane.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.933
He had dropped that affectation

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.433
by the time I arrived.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.800
But he's still smoked like a
chimney, although at that

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.267
time, he was on the Surgeon
General's committee about

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:37.533
smoking and health, and he
absolutely quit then, and but

00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.800
he ultimately succumbed
to lung cancer.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.367
So this is a way of
homage to him.

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:49.800
These are some of the steroids,
the ones that are

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.133
sex hormones.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:54.133
So very small amounts of them
go around and make various

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.600
things happen in your body.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.400
And they begin up at the top
left with cholesterol, and you

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.433
can see how various enzymes
oxidize and put a ketone here,

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:05.967
an alcohol here, making
unsaturation and so on to make

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:09.433
all these important compounds.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.667
In fact, they were recognized
as so important that work on

00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:19.333
steroids awarded four Nobel
Prizes between 1927 and 1950,

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:23.600
and another three between 1965
and 1975, which were, at least

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.567
in part, due to work
on steroids.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.767
The awards in 1927 and '28
were determining the

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:35.900
structure, and the one in
1965 recognized the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.933
synthesis of it.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:38.833
You have to know the structure
before you can

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.367
synthesize it, obviously.

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:44.967
In fact, the ones in 1927 and
'28 were for determining the

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.567
wrong structure.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.133
The thing they got the Nobel
Prize for was this structure,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.667
which doesn't have three
six-membered rings, bing,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.500
bing, bing, like that.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.833
But it got settled
in the 1930s.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:02.067
So by 1950, the Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine was

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:05.367
awarded to Kendall, Reichsten,
and Showalter Hench "for their

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.067
discoveries relating to the
hormones of the adrenal

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:11.533
cortex, their structure and
biological effects." So

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:14.467
Kendall and Reichstein were
organic chemists, and

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:18.733
Showalter Hench was a
physiologist.

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:22.967
And Hench's Nobel address
said "This air of pessimism

00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:25.633
regarding the rheumatic disease
in general and rheumatoid

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:29.200
arthritis in particular still
finds expression in some of

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.667
the modern writings
and texts."

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.367
But then he goes on to describe
how he had a patient

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:39.233
at the Mayo Clinic, a
65 year old patient,

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:40.467
with an unusual story.

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.400
A few days before he came, he
was "painfully affected with

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.467
rheumatoid arthritis, and
had been for four years.

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:49.200
Then jaundice suddenly
developed, and within a week,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.767
most of his arthritic
manifestations had

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:52.967
disappeared.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:56.367
The jaundice lasted five weeks,
and the rheumatic arthritis

00:03:56.367 --> 00:03:59.067
did not relapse until several
weeks after the jaundice had

00:03:59.067 --> 00:04:00.333
disappeared.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.433
"The thought occurred instead
of being relentlessly

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:05.567
progressive, this disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, may be

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:07.900
potentially reversible, more
so than we believed.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.933
Perhaps rapidly so."

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.300
"So during the next five years,
from '29 to '34, while

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.267
the organic chemists were
determining the true

00:04:15.267 --> 00:04:19.033
structure, observations were
made on sixteen patients with

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:22.300
chronic arthritis or fibrositis,
in whom jaundice

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.300
of different types and
degrees developed.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.867
If the jaundice was deep
enough, it was characterized

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:30.533
by bilirubinemia of the
'direct-reacting' type, the

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:33.367
rheumatic symptoms quickly
diminished or disappeared for

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:36.767
varying lengths of time...
and then gradually returned."

00:04:36.767 --> 00:04:38.667
And furthermore, it was
noted that during

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:40.733
pregnancy, people lost that.

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:43.467
So there was thought
to be some hormone

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:45.467
that would do this.

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:48.100
So they figured that out.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.133
You can read that yourself.

00:04:50.133 --> 00:04:51.267
OK.

00:04:51.267 --> 00:04:57.500
So Reichstein then, the Swiss
chemist, took 1000 kilograms

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.733
of adrenal glands from cattle,
and was able to get a 1

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.400
kilogram of dry residue from
that and follow the activity

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.700
as he parcelled it out,
including using Girard's

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:13.000
ketone reagent T.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.867
Remember, we talked about that's
the thing that makes a

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:18.700
hydrazone, and that it has a
permanent cationic charge, so

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.100
it will take a ketone into
water, then you can take it

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.833
off and it'll go back
into the organics?

00:05:22.833 --> 00:05:26.433
That was a powerful way of
separating these ketones.

00:05:26.433 --> 00:05:30.500
And so there we go.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.100
So they got 7 to 8 grams of
a ketone out of that.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.433
So this was this fishhook
to extract ketones.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:37.300
We've talked about that before,
so I'm just going to

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.700
click through it very rapidly
to show how it was

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.200
synthesized.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.667
And now we know what it did.

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.300
"Only when pure crystalline
homogeneous substances were

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.533
produced were they tested as far
as possible biologically.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.267
So accurate determination
of chemical

00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:54.867
structure was given priority.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:58.033
In nearly all cases, this could
be elucidated in all its

00:05:58.033 --> 00:05:58.867
details."

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:03.333
So now by the mid-1930s, they
had what the structures were.

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:06.833
And here were some of these
steroids from the adrenal

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:11.967
cortex, 29 of them, of which
these five were particularly

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:15.067
important as active.

00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:18.600
Now those two, you notice,
are on the top cortisol.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.900
It has an OH group on
the top left here.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.833
And below it is cortisone,
the ketone.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:32.933
So that position 11 and the
position 17 were particularly

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:33.633
important then.

00:06:33.633 --> 00:06:37.167
You have to have that ketone
at 11 to get cortisone.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:40.533
"The introduction of an oxygen
atom in position 11 of the

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.267
steroid skeleton is one of the
major difficulties in the

00:06:43.267 --> 00:06:43.767
synthetic

00:06:43.767 --> 00:06:46.433
production cortisone." Why?

00:06:46.433 --> 00:06:49.000
Because it's so far away from
any other functional group.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.833
It's not alpha to something, or
the beta position, where an

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:54.367
alpha beta unsaturation
could be used.

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:55.033
Right?

00:06:55.033 --> 00:06:58.500
"The preparation of the
substance from deoxycholic

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.267
acid still remains a long and
laborious way, even when so

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:04.633
many improvements to it
have been discovered.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.067
If it is wished to obtain
cortisone more simply, there

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:08.067
remain two ways.

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:11.533
Either total synthesis or the
discovery of a better

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:14.767
qualified raw material that's
close in structure to this,

00:07:14.767 --> 00:07:16.133
that then you could
convert into

00:07:16.133 --> 00:07:17.533
this for medical purposes.

00:07:17.533 --> 00:07:19.267
Both will be tried.

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.733
The prospects of a total
synthesis are difficult to

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.400
assess."

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.067
So it's going to be
tough to do this.

00:07:26.067 --> 00:07:27.867
Either total synthesis
or you've got find

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:29.567
a better raw material.

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:31.000
And there's a footnote there.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.467
"R.B. Woodward referred to the
partial synthesis of an acid

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:37.567
which is already very closely
related to cortisone...

00:07:37.567 --> 00:07:43.400
9 April 1951 in Boston, Mass."
And it gives a reference here.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:43.733
OK.

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:48.367
So this book that I talked about
uses as an example of a

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.167
total synthesis Woodward's

00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:53.400
synthesis in 1951 of cortisone.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.200
And this is it, but we're going
to go through it slowly.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.333
So this is the thing
he wanted to make.

00:08:00.333 --> 00:08:04.300
It's got these four rings, A,
B, C, and D. And obviously

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.600
it's going to take a lot
of steps to get there.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.833
So the first goal is to make
rings C and D. Why did I put a

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:15.467
question mark on D?

00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:16.833
STUDENT: It's a 
six-membered ring

00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:18.233
PROFESSOR: It's a
six-membered ring, not a

00:08:18.233 --> 00:08:19.133
five-membered ring.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.767
So he's got something clever in
the back of his mind when

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.067
he thinks of that as the first
thing he wants to make.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:29.333
And that will be a handle, that
double bond on the far

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:32.133
right, a handle to allow
modification, to make the ring

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:34.700
a smaller size and put
the functionality

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.667
that you need on there.

00:08:36.667 --> 00:08:37.367
OK.

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:41.233
And this double bond at the
top left of ring C is the

00:08:41.233 --> 00:08:43.767
thing that's going to allow us
to get access to put the

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:46.867
ketone on there.

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:50.133
And down at the bottom, this
ketone is a handle.

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:53.033
It's at this position
down here.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.567
This is going to be a handle to
build the rings A and B. So

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:58.100
we'll see how that works.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.233
So this compound was known and
readily available and cheap.

00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:06.533
So you could get a lot
of it to start with.

00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:10.767
So the first reaction he did was
to build ring D onto that.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:13.533
How did he do that?

00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:17.067
What kind of reaction could
build ring D, make these bonds

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:19.967
that are highlighted
in blue, here?

00:09:19.967 --> 00:09:21.200
Anybody got an idea?

00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:23.967
STUDENT: The Diels-Alder
reaction.

00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:27.567
PROFESSOR: The
Diels-Alder reaction, Right?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:31.133
So he did that, the standard old
Diels-Alder reaction, and

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:32.400
he put that ring on.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.533
But notice when the diene sits
down on top of that double

00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:40.400
bond, the methyl and the
hydrogen are going to be on

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.500
the same side.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:48.333
Whereas over here, they want
to be on opposite sides.

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:50.833
So we better get that fixed up
so that they won't have the

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:53.767
wrong stereoisomer when
we get to the end.

00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:56.800
Can you see any way to change it
so that this hydrogen is no

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.133
longer pointing down,
but pointing up?

00:10:04.967 --> 00:10:06.700
Yeah, Amy?

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.100
STUDENT: Can you use the

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:08.933
Mitsunobu reaction?

00:10:08.933 --> 00:10:09.533
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:10:09.533 --> 00:10:12.000
Mitsunobu inverts an alcohol.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.067
If you have an alcohol, you can
go from right-handed to

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:15.500
left-handed.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.167
But there's
no alcohol here.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.000
What functionality is 
handy? Rahul?

00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:26.567
What's special about the
position of that H?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.467
STUDENT: It's... I want to say
it's...

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:37.767
PROFESSOR: We want to
pull that hydrogen off and put

00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:41.567
it back on the other side.

00:10:41.567 --> 00:10:43.333
There are a zillion
hydrogens in here.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:43.733
Ayesha?

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:46.333
STUDENT: Is it because it's next
to a carbonyl group?

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:47.167
PROFESSOR: Aha!

00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.200
Enol, enolate.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.533
OK.

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:55.867
So we want to go to that,
and you do it with base.

00:10:55.867 --> 00:10:59.500
It's an enolate, and the trans
isomer is more stable, so it

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.600
goes all over there
via the enolate.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.400
And now we're going to make
the ketones into alcohols.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.233
Can you think of a reagent
that could do that?

00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.500
This is review.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.700
What kind of reagent
is necessary?

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.933
STUDENT: Reducing agent.

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:18.433
PROFESSOR: A 
reducing agent.

00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:20.733
Something that will add hydride
to the carbonyl.

00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:21.967
Any ideas?

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:26.200
STUDENT: Hydrogen peroxide?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.267
PROFESSOR:
Hydrogen peroxide.

00:11:27.267 --> 00:11:29.233
Good idea, everyone?

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:30.233
STUDENT: No.

00:11:30.233 --> 00:11:31.800
PROFESSOR: Why?

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.300
It's an oxidizing agent,
not a reducing agent.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.600
Lithium aluminum hydride does
the trick, so you do that.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.567
Now, what they want to do is
get from this diol now over

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:48.567
here to a ketone and
an unsaturation.

00:11:48.567 --> 00:11:52.200
You already have an
unsaturation here.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.467
So let's think about
how we do that.

00:11:56.467 --> 00:12:00.533
The oxidation levels turn
out to be the same.

00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:05.867
So you just use acid to
eliminate...acid in water, so

00:12:05.867 --> 00:12:09.767
you can protonate and
get that cation.

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:11.600
But why get that cation?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.767
Why not protonate here and get
the cation on the bottom, or

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:16.567
protonate here, and
lose methanol, and

00:12:16.567 --> 00:12:18.600
get the cation there?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.733
Well, the cation here is no
good, because it's a sigma--

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:22.833
it's in the sigma system.

00:12:22.833 --> 00:12:25.300
It's not conjugated with
the double bond.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:30.367
This one is allylic, but that
would be allylic too.

00:12:30.367 --> 00:12:33.867
But if you make that one,
then the resonance

00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:34.867
structure is here.

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:40.233
There's the vacant orbital, the
low LUMO is here and here,

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:42.867
And it's adjacent to the
unshared pair on oxygen.

00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:44.833
So that's the one
you want to do.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:47.733
So it takes off the one they
want to take off, at the top,

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:48.967
you get that.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:55.700
Now you do an allylic
rearrangement of OH.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.533
Or you complete the allylic
arrangement.

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:05.333
You took it off here, and
you put it on here.

00:13:05.333 --> 00:13:07.133
Now, what functional group
do you have now,

00:13:10.833 --> 00:13:13.933
when you have OH an OR
on the same carbon? Ruoyi?

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:19.267
STUDENT: Hemiketal.

00:13:19.267 --> 00:13:23.967
PROFESSOR: What does it
do, what does a hemiketal do?

00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:25.600
Loses alcohol.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.900
Right?

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:31.367
So the hemiacetal here, treat it
with acid, protonate, lose

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:33.267
that, and you've got
the ketone now.

00:13:33.267 --> 00:13:33.533
Right?

00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:35.400
So we've got it to here.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.167
But we need to get this OH off
to get down to what he wants

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:40.533
to build this over here.

00:13:40.533 --> 00:13:44.200
So he treats it with
acetic anhydride.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.900
What does an alcohol do with
the acetic anhyride?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:51.700
The O attacks the carbonyl,
acetate leaves.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.200
It's a substitution reaction
at an acyl carbon.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:59.500
So you put acetate on here.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.500
And now to get from here to
here, we have to change an O

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.533
on the ring into an
H on the ring.

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:09.700
What kind of reagent
do we need?

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:10.400
STUDENT: Reducing.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.100
PROFESSOR: We need a
reducing agent, right?

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.567
So like a metal.

00:14:13.567 --> 00:14:19.133
So we use the zinc. So zinc
comes in, gives electrons.

00:14:19.133 --> 00:14:22.867
The acetate leaves.

00:14:22.867 --> 00:14:27.333
So we generate this anion and
that double bond and enolate.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.733
But of course, this is a
resonance structure of it, and

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:32.267
you put a proton on the
anion down there.

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:34.133
So he's got to that.

00:14:34.133 --> 00:14:36.600
So now we're ready for
the next step.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.867
And the next step is to build
ring B, and also, to protect

00:14:43.867 --> 00:14:46.600
the double bond here so it won't
react when other double

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.500
bonds react.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.267
And this thing here on B,
building this thing on B, will

00:14:54.267 --> 00:15:03.533
be a handle to construct ring
A. And that double bond here

00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:06.267
gives you access to that place,
which is, remember,

00:15:06.267 --> 00:15:08.200
where we need to put a
ketone, which is sort

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.200
of off in left field.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:11.467
OK.

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:15.167
So the first thing is to build
ring B. Did you ever see a

00:15:15.167 --> 00:15:21.233
thing like that, where from
the ketone here we build a

00:15:21.233 --> 00:15:23.233
whole six-membered
ring down here?

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:28.567
We saw it two lectures ago.

00:15:28.567 --> 00:15:29.367
STUDENT: The Robinson
annulation.

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:32.000
PROFESSOR: The 
Robinson annulation.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.900
So what we need is ethyl vinyl
ketone, not methyl vinyl

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:38.567
ketone, but ethyl, in order
to get this extra

00:15:38.567 --> 00:15:39.500
methyl group in here.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.667
So this thing, which normally
would be methyl vinyl ketone,

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.433
is now ethyl vinyl ketone,
so we'll have that

00:15:45.433 --> 00:15:46.500
methyl group on here.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:46.800
OK.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.167
So ethyl vinyl ketone generates
the enolate, does a

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:54.000
conjugate addition,
or sometimes

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.433
called a Michael addition.

00:15:56.433 --> 00:16:00.900
Make that enolate anion,
protonate it, and now make the

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:04.767
other enolate anion and have it
attack the carbonyl to make

00:16:04.767 --> 00:16:06.100
the beginning of that
double bond.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.267
What would you call that
kind of reaction?

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:12.167
If you make this enolate react
with this, and end up with an

00:16:12.167 --> 00:16:15.800
alpha, beta unsaturated ketone?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.033
So you have a ketone attack
another ketone to give an

00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:20.900
alpha-beta unsaturated ketone.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.933
Remember what you call that?

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:24.233
Aldol.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:25.633
You still have a week,
don't panic.

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:31.433
So we're going to do an
aldol reaction, and

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:35.067
then get over here.

00:16:35.067 --> 00:16:37.667
Now, what we do there, in order
to make this protecting

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:40.367
group, is treat with
osmium tetroxyde.

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:42.000
We know that that
makes a diol.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.567
We talked about that when
we were talking

00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:46.767
about paracyclic reactions.

00:16:46.767 --> 00:16:48.767
OK, so you can get the diol.

00:16:48.767 --> 00:16:51.833
Then you make the diol into
this carbon with two more

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:52.833
methyls on it.

00:16:52.833 --> 00:16:57.500
What kind of functional
group is this?

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.367
Two ORs on the same carbon.

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:05.533
That's a full acetal, right?

00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:12.733
And you make it by reacting a
ketone acetone with a diol.

00:17:12.733 --> 00:17:15.600
So we're going to get this
ketal, or acetal.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:15.867
OK.

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:19.867
Now we need to go across
from here to here.

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:23.067
And what we're doing is removing
this double bond.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.033
So that's done with catalytic
hydrogenation.

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:33.233
And notice, that's why
we had to protect

00:17:33.233 --> 00:17:34.900
this double bond here.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.267
Because it would have
been destroyed.

00:17:37.267 --> 00:17:40.633
And if it was destroyed, then
you'd have no functionality

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:43.533
out here in order to change
the six ring into

00:17:43.533 --> 00:17:46.067
five-membered ring and put
the other stuff on.

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:49.233
So you had to first
protect this, then

00:17:49.233 --> 00:17:52.233
get rid of this one.

00:17:52.233 --> 00:17:55.400
So now he's got this compound.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:01.733
And now we're going to knock
ring D off while we work on

00:18:01.733 --> 00:18:04.567
ring A so the whole slide
won't fill up.

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:08.700
So we'll just take that thing
up there and work on ring A.

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:12.500
Now, what kind of reaction might
make ring A an alpha

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.600
beta unsaturated ketone here?

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.367
Any reactions that give alpha,
beta unsaturated ketones?

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:21.000
STUDENT: Robinson?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.167
PROFESSOR: Aldol
reactions.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:24.067
So that's what we're going to be
looking for, but there are

00:18:24.067 --> 00:18:26.367
some problems, as you'll see.

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:27.500
So we're going to do that.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:31.800
We're going to get this, and
then an aldol reaction on that

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.533
will make this, and we can get
this by adding the anion here

00:18:36.533 --> 00:18:40.933
conjugate to an alpha, beta
unsaturated ketone here.

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:45.533
What do we call it? What do you
call that kind of reaction?

00:18:45.533 --> 00:18:47.467
STUDENT: Robinson annulation.

00:18:47.467 --> 00:18:49.833
PROFESSOR: The whole
thing, to start from

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:55.367
here and build this ring. Build
a ring? You said it before.

00:18:55.367 --> 00:18:56.133
STUDENT: Robinson annulation

00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:57.400
PROFESSOR: Robinson
annulation,

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.567
we're going to do again.

00:18:59.567 --> 00:19:01.967
So that would be ready
for the aldol.

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:05.833
And now this double bond here
is even closer to where we

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:08.367
needed in order to
make that ketone.

00:19:08.367 --> 00:19:08.633
OK.

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:09.433
Now how do you do that?

00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:10.667
Now there's a problem.

00:19:10.667 --> 00:19:14.433
You have to make the enolate to
do the Robinson annulation.

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:18.867
But this is where you form
the enolate, down there.

00:19:18.867 --> 00:19:21.767
You could remove one of these
hydrogens and make an enolate,

00:19:21.767 --> 00:19:25.100
or you could remove one of those
hydrogens and make an

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:30.100
anion there, which would be
allylic with an anion there,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.533
which is an enolate.

00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:35.267
So this one is called a
vinylogous enolate.

00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:38.867
It's got an extra double bond
in between, but still, it

00:19:38.867 --> 00:19:40.933
would behave as an enolate.

00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:44.367
But the problem is that this
one is more reactive.

00:19:44.367 --> 00:19:47.933
You want to make the enolate
here, which you can do by

00:19:47.933 --> 00:19:52.967
removing one of those purple
H's, and then having the anion

00:19:52.967 --> 00:19:54.433
be there as a resonance
structure.

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:55.167
That's fine.

00:19:55.167 --> 00:20:00.333
Except that these are the ones
that get pulled off easier.

00:20:00.333 --> 00:20:02.700
So what do you do?

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.933
You go ahead, pull these off.

00:20:04.933 --> 00:20:07.467
Tie them up somehow with
something else.

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:10.600
Then get the other one, and then
come back and take off

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.633
what you had put on there.

00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:15.300
Use a protecting group.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.133
And notice, incidentally, that
there's another H here that

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.733
could also be pulled off that
would have a resonance

00:20:20.733 --> 00:20:22.200
structure with the anion here.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.367
So there are lots of
possibilities.

00:20:25.367 --> 00:20:30.233
You want to get that anion,
which is like that anion.

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.500
So first you have to
protect the more

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.867
reactive alpha position.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.800
And they do that by--

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.000
that's just abbreviating
what's above.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.033
Makes the enolate, attack that
carbonyl, which has a leaving

00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:50.567
group on it, so the OCH3
will leave, and

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.933
generate this diketone.

00:20:53.933 --> 00:20:57.067
That's like a Claisen reaction
that we talked about last

00:20:57.067 --> 00:21:00.233
time, where an enolate
attacks an ester,

00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:03.300
and the alcohol leaves.

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.367
And then that gets attacked
by an amine to give this.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:12.433
And that dehydrates.

00:21:12.433 --> 00:21:15.500
It's like making an alpha,
beta-unsaturated ketone,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.367
except it has this nitrogen 
on it now.

00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:18.667
Which helps out.

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:20.300
The unshared pair on
the nitrogen is

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:21.667
stabilized by this.

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:24.000
You can draw resonance
structures that put charge on

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.467
the oxygen.

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:25.800
OK.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.833
So this is like an aldol, an
alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone.

00:21:28.833 --> 00:21:32.367
And also notice it's
an enamine.

00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:35.433
So that's tied up the
downstairs part.

00:21:35.433 --> 00:21:39.267
And now you can proceed with
making the anion you want,

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:42.467
which is going to add to
there, and hopefully by

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.500
Robinson methyl vinyl
ketone, or--

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.100
pardon me.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.333
Yeah, methyl vinyl
ketone this time.

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:51.867
Because the first time, we had
to put the CH3 in there, when

00:21:51.867 --> 00:21:56.467
we used this enolate
over here.

00:21:56.467 --> 00:22:01.567
Now we don't need a CH3 here,
so we don't need it.

00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:02.667
We can use methyl.

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:05.167
Except it doesn't work.

00:22:05.167 --> 00:22:06.633
The reaction doesn't work.

00:22:06.633 --> 00:22:10.467
So you have to do something
a little more roundabout.

00:22:10.467 --> 00:22:12.900
So that doesn't work.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:19.767
But if you can't add it to
methyl vinyl ketone, you can

00:22:19.767 --> 00:22:21.433
add it to the double
bond here.

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:24.200
Do a conjugate addition
to this sort of like a

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.867
ketone, to that nitrile.

00:22:26.867 --> 00:22:30.267
So the enolate adds to this
carbon, generate the anion

00:22:30.267 --> 00:22:32.967
next to the nitrile.Then
protonate it, and you've got

00:22:32.967 --> 00:22:33.667
that.

00:22:33.667 --> 00:22:35.033
Conjugate addition again.

00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:44.000
But the problem is, the
CH3 here could be

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
either up or down.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.500
You could have added to either
face of that anion.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:54.200
So here's what they said in
the paper about that.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.100
"The protected ketone
was condensed with

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.167
acrylonitrile"--

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.067
that's that compound with
cyanide up at the top--

00:23:00.067 --> 00:23:02.600
"in the presence of aqueous
Triton B in

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:16.267
t-butanol-benzine, solvent,

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:19.300
and the product on basic
hydrolysis yielded [this long

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:22.300
name thing], as a mixture
of two isomers."

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.333
That's the problem.

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:25.167
That's a mixture
of two isomers.

00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:27.200
And that's just lore, whether
you're going to get

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
something like that.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.833
And sometimes you just have to
suck it up, because there's no

00:23:31.833 --> 00:23:34.667
hydrogen you can pull off
here to make it come

00:23:34.667 --> 00:23:35.533
on the other side.

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:36.567
That's just the way it is.

00:23:36.567 --> 00:23:39.567
So you've got to throw away a
certain amount of your stuff.

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:41.800
OK, so that's tough.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.767
Right?

00:23:42.767 --> 00:23:49.833
So then they used a strong base
and water, which removed

00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:52.300
this protecting group.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.400
Made it back into
the CH2 here.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:00.133
And at the same time, it was
strong enough that it

00:24:00.133 --> 00:24:05.700
hydrolyzed the nitrile to make
a carboxylic acid there

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:09.733
So now, treat that with acid,
protonate there. Then

00:24:09.733 --> 00:24:13.667
protonate here, making
that cation.

00:24:13.667 --> 00:24:18.767
But that can attack the carbonyl
to get that, which

00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:21.267
can then lose a proton,
so you've got a

00:24:21.267 --> 00:24:23.833
six-membered ring.

00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:26.667
So have we made it?

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:27.333
Not quite.

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:29.800
We got the wrong element there,
oxygen instead of

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.900
carbon at the bottom.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.100
So we need another carbon
in the system.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:41.967
So protonate there, cation,
eliminate, we've got that

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:43.633
double bond.

00:24:43.633 --> 00:24:44.567
OK.

00:24:44.567 --> 00:24:47.733
But now we need to convert that
into ring A. We need to

00:24:47.733 --> 00:24:51.133
put that extra blue methyl
group on there.

00:24:51.133 --> 00:24:54.933
So the way to do it is to
use methyl Grignard.

00:24:54.933 --> 00:24:58.600
So the methyl minus adds to the
carbonyl, and that is a

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.833
leaving group.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.533
And that's an enolate, so
it becomes a ketone.

00:25:09.533 --> 00:25:11.967
And we've got this thing here.

00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:14.567
So we're getting closer now.

00:25:14.567 --> 00:25:19.067
You do an aldol and
you have ring A.

00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:22.400
So this is a typical
thing that happens.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.900
It looked like a Robinson
annulation might go directly

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.700
there, but it didn't work,
so they do a work-around.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:34.567
So now A is all set, and now
we need to work on ring D.

00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:36.200
Which is, remember, a
six-membered ring, and it

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.833
needs to be a five-membered
ring.

00:25:38.833 --> 00:25:40.200
So we'll put it up
in the corner and

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.433
start working on that.

00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:45.867
So the first thing--what they're
going to go for is to

00:25:45.867 --> 00:25:49.000
make it a five-membered ring
that has an ester group coming

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.833
off, so you have that
carbonyl groups that

00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:53.267
we're going to want.

00:25:53.267 --> 00:25:55.433
The first thing they do is treat
it with acid and water.

00:25:55.433 --> 00:25:56.700
What do they do that for?

00:26:02.167 --> 00:26:03.067
PROFESSOR: What's
that going to

00:26:03.067 --> 00:26:04.300
do with that compound? Ayesha?

00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:08.600
STUDENT: It's going to remove
the acetal and give the diol.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.367
Now you can get rid of
the protecting group.

00:26:10.367 --> 00:26:13.100
You want to be able to work on
that double bond now, so you

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.267
take the protecting group off
that you had on there when you

00:26:15.267 --> 00:26:16.533
were doing the catalytic
hydrogenation.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.767
And now we've got the diol.

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:29.500
And now treat it with
periodic acid.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.733
You remember what that does?

00:26:32.533 --> 00:26:33.300
STUDENT: Oxidizes.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:37.633
J.MICHAEL MCBRIDE: It oxidizes a
diol to cleave the carbon-carbon

00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:42.600
bond in between and make two
carbonyl groups.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.500
So at first it adds, and then
that's just an intermediate, a

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.567
transient intermediate.

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:51.200
It comes apart to give
two aldehydes.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.200
And now, how are you going
to make a

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.467
five-membered ring?

00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.733
STUDENT: Decarboxylation.

00:27:01.733 --> 00:27:04.500
PROFESSOR: You can make
an enolate here, attack

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.567
that carbonyl, or
make an enolate

00:27:07.567 --> 00:27:10.367
here, attack this carbonyl.

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:11.867
Those are going to give
different products.

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:20.300
What you need to do is to have
this enolate attack this

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.700
carbonyl if you want to make
that compound, rather than

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:32.333
have this enolate react with
that one, and get the

00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:35.967
carboxylic acid down here.

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:41.433
It turns out that base with
aldol could be either that way

00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:45.533
or that way, and luck made it
go the right way this time.

00:27:45.533 --> 00:27:48.033
Robinson annulation didn't
work before, but this one

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.700
worked the right way.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.433
And then we've got
an aldehyde.

00:27:52.433 --> 00:27:54.367
We need the carboxylic acid.

00:27:54.367 --> 00:27:57.467
So you use dichromate oxidation,
which we talked

00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:58.967
about, to oxidize an alcohol.

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:01.400
And of course, you don't stop
at the aldehyde, you

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.067
go on to the acid.

00:28:03.067 --> 00:28:04.733
But you need the ester.

00:28:04.733 --> 00:28:06.133
So now they're going
to make the ester.

00:28:06.133 --> 00:28:08.700
You could do Fischer
esterification, but that's an

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.733
equilibrium, and this stuff
is becoming very precious,

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:14.267
because of all the work
that you put into it.

00:28:14.267 --> 00:28:17.833
So you want to do this in the
highest possible yield.

00:28:17.833 --> 00:28:22.267
So they use diazomethane,
remember, which is the way of

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:28.267
doing it really to change the
acid into methyl ester in

00:28:28.267 --> 00:28:29.967
really high yield.

00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:32.700
So that's a dangerous compound
to work with.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:38.633
It's much more expensive and
cumbersome than doing a

00:28:38.633 --> 00:28:40.400
Fischer esterification.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.667
But it gives a really
high yield, so

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:45.733
that's what they did.

00:28:45.733 --> 00:28:49.800
So now they had the
ketone here.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.167
And now they made
into an alcohol.

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:54.633
Now, this looks nuts, right?

00:28:54.633 --> 00:28:56.700
they already had the
ketone there, which

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.033
is what they want.

00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:02.367
And the double bond here,
they've got it.

00:29:02.367 --> 00:29:05.033
Why do they backtrack?

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:09.667
They backtracked because it was
already known from 1918--

00:29:09.667 --> 00:29:14.933
so they used borohydride this
time to reduce the ketone to

00:29:14.933 --> 00:29:16.500
an alcohol.

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:19.067
If they'd used lithium aluminum
hydride, it would

00:29:19.067 --> 00:29:21.233
have reduced the ester to an
alcohol, and they didn't want

00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:22.700
to do that.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:24.767
So you have to choose the
reagents carefully when

00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:27.367
there's possible competition
like that.

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:32.133
Now, it was 1909 it was found
out that this alcohol could be

00:29:32.133 --> 00:29:35.600
separated, the two enantiomers,
easily.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.900
That was already known 50
years before, right?

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.200
So they backtracked in order--

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.733
see, all this stuff they've
been doing started with

00:29:44.733 --> 00:29:46.367
achiral material.

00:29:46.367 --> 00:29:49.267
So they've got both right and
left-handed stuff there, and

00:29:49.267 --> 00:29:52.033
they want only the one
enantiomer, ultimately.

00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:54.500
And someplace, they're going
to have to separate it, and

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.633
this is where they do
the separation.

00:29:56.633 --> 00:30:00.267
Because it turns out, if you put
this in together with this

00:30:00.267 --> 00:30:04.433
digitonin stuff, which itself,
notice, has a six, six, six,

00:30:04.433 --> 00:30:07.900
five steroid inside it--
this complicated

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.167
sapogenin, as it's called.

00:30:10.167 --> 00:30:15.000
Then those things come
together, and what

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.633
precipitates is just one hand.

00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:20.133
The other one stays
in solution.

00:30:20.133 --> 00:30:22.067
So this was obviously lore.

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:23.333
But anyhow, they got that.

00:30:23.333 --> 00:30:27.900
And now, having made this, it
turned out that previous

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:32.033
studies of cortisone had shown
that if you had this, you

00:30:32.033 --> 00:30:35.667
could make this from it.

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:38.967
So this in this is called
a total synthesis.

00:30:38.967 --> 00:30:41.700
But in fact, it's
a formal total

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.333
synthesis, or a relay synthesis.

00:30:44.333 --> 00:30:46.600
Because by the time they got
here, they had very little

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:49.533
material, so they couldn't
do a bunch more steps.

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:52.233
But it was known that those
steps could be done, because

00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:54.600
people had already done them.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.400
So they could, then, start with
material which had been

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.767
made from cortisone or
some other sterol and

00:31:00.767 --> 00:31:01.700
then carry it through.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.867
But there was no point in doing
it, because people had

00:31:03.867 --> 00:31:06.333
already done those reactions.

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:07.833
So this is the paper.

00:31:07.833 --> 00:31:11.867
This is the whole paper that
described the total synthesis

00:31:11.867 --> 00:31:13.367
of cortisone.

00:31:13.367 --> 00:31:16.567
Woodward was not a man
of many words.

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:17.233
Right?

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:19.600
There had actually been a
previous paper of about two

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:23.767
pages about making the precursor
that we showed.

00:31:23.767 --> 00:31:26.200
So he then had this.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:31.367
He reduced this double bond.

00:31:31.367 --> 00:31:37.067
But notice, it did reduce this
one and this one, but didn't

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:38.133
reduce this one.

00:31:38.133 --> 00:31:43.400
So again, this is testing the
various methods you're using

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.900
to make sure what's going
to react and what isn't.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.933
Why didn't they want to get
rid of that double bond?

00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:51.967
Because that's the one that's
going to give them the handle

00:31:51.967 --> 00:31:54.300
to get that ketone in up
there, which is a very

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.567
difficult position.

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.300
And then they could do sodium
borohydride that made the

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.600
alcohol that we showed
you before.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.133
But notice that the borohydride

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:06.367
didn't attack here.

00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:08.933
It only attacked down here.

00:32:08.933 --> 00:32:11.933
Then they made the acetate
from that alcohol.

00:32:11.933 --> 00:32:17.467
And now they've got to convert
this to cortisone.

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:21.667
At this point, our synthetic
work intersects the lines

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:25.433
previously laid down in the
extensive prior investigations

00:32:25.433 --> 00:32:26.400
by many groups.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.167
So he goes through some
of these groups.

00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:29.600
"Heymann and Fieser"--

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.333
that's the guy that wrote
this story, right--

00:32:32.333 --> 00:32:36.600
"have recently converted the
acetoxy-ester (III) into [this

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:39.667
compound] V." So here's the
reference to that.

00:32:39.667 --> 00:32:41.667
It was worked in 1951.

00:32:41.667 --> 00:32:45.567
So what they did was to--

00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:52.800
let's see, whoa, whoa, whoa, we
have a lot of stuff here--

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.633
reaction four, oh, reference
four, reference five, then

00:32:55.633 --> 00:32:59.667
reference six puts that thing
on up there, and then

00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:05.633
reference seven puts the
alcohol in or whatever.

00:33:05.633 --> 00:33:09.433
And finally the double bond
by Mattox and Kendall.

00:33:09.433 --> 00:33:11.733
Kendall, remember, is the guy
that got the Nobel Prize, the

00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:13.033
chemist at the Mayo Institute.

00:33:15.967 --> 00:33:17.133
So that did it.

00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:17.667
They had it.

00:33:17.667 --> 00:33:21.667
They'd solve the intellectual
artistic problem of how you

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:23.233
can start with simple,
available

00:33:23.233 --> 00:33:24.867
compounds and make cortisone.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.867
But what was the yield?

00:33:30.867 --> 00:33:33.400
Think a minute about yield.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.900
Suppose you do 39 steps, and
each step has an 80% yield,

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.533
which isn't so bad, as
you've found in lab.

00:33:40.533 --> 00:33:42.467
Right?

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:47.967
Then the overall yield is 0.01%
if you take 0.8 to the

00:33:47.967 --> 00:33:49.867
39th power.

00:33:49.867 --> 00:33:52.267
But there's a different
way to go about it,

00:33:52.267 --> 00:33:55.067
what's called a convergence
synthesis, where

00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:58.667
you make several big pieces,
and then link the pieces

00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:02.500
together, so the distance in
number of steps from any one

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.267
starting material to the product
is smaller than having

00:34:05.267 --> 00:34:07.933
all 39 in a row.

00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:09.967
So you could start with
something that does nine

00:34:09.967 --> 00:34:13.400
steps, say, that makes A.
Another nine step sequence

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.700
makes B. Another makes C, and
another makes D. And now you

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.633
put A and B together, and C and
D together, to make E and F,

00:34:20.633 --> 00:34:22.200
and then you put
them together.

00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.567
And now the distance is only
nine steps plus two steps for

00:34:26.567 --> 00:34:30.600
any given starting material,
and you get a 9% yield.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:34.500
So convergent synthesis
has real advantages.

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.000
Now, how about a practical
cortisone synthesis that could

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.333
make something that people
could afford to use?

00:34:40.333 --> 00:34:41.667
Well, there's cortisone.

00:34:41.667 --> 00:34:45.733
Remember, that's what the
Nobel laureate said.

00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:46.833
There are two things
you can do.

00:34:46.833 --> 00:34:49.833
Either do a total synthesis,
or get a better starting

00:34:49.833 --> 00:34:52.200
material than was
then available.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:54.033
So choose an appropriate,
readily

00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:55.900
available starting material.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:56.500
OK.

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.600
Desoxycholic acid, a bile acid
that you can get from

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.733
slaughterhouses, or get the
glands from which to make it

00:35:02.733 --> 00:35:04.267
from slaughterhouses.

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:06.200
It comes from ox bile.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.667
So in 1946, '49, Merck made a
kilogram of cortisone from 600

00:35:11.667 --> 00:35:15.167
kilograms of that bile acid
which came from an enormous

00:35:15.167 --> 00:35:18.333
amount of stuff from
the slaughterhouse.

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:20.633
But notice why that was a
good starting material.

00:35:20.633 --> 00:35:25.233
It has all the rings in place
of the right size,

00:35:25.233 --> 00:35:27.333
and it's properly methylated.

00:35:27.333 --> 00:35:29.833
So it's got the skeleton,
the carbon skeleton.

00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:33.000
It's got all those things in
the right stereochemistry.

00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:42.867
It's got, here, functional
groups at or near at least

00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:46.033
some of the proper positions.

00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:50.033
You're going to have to fiddle
around out here somehow.

00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:54.800
But how are you going
to do that?

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.967
Well, you could imagine, they
were able to go in twelve

00:35:57.967 --> 00:35:58.867
steps to that.

00:35:58.867 --> 00:36:01.033
And we're not going to go
through what those next 20

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:03.033
steps are that allow you
to get the red thing.

00:36:03.033 --> 00:36:07.500
But you could imagine things
like, do a bromination at a

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.433
tertiary position.

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:10.600
Maybe you could do that.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.500
Then eliminate HBr, maybe.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.200
It could go the wrong way.

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:17.300
Then maybe you could cleave the
double bond and make the

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.533
ketone, then maybe you could do
alpha-bromination adjacent

00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:24.333
to the ketone, and then make
alcohols from that.

00:36:24.333 --> 00:36:25.100
Something like that.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:25.800
You can imagine.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:26.767
That's not what was done.

00:36:26.767 --> 00:36:28.633
That wouldn't be twenty steps.

00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:29.900
It didn't work that way.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:33.533
But you can imagine ways that
you could get at it.

00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:37.000
So they did it in 20 steps.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.800
So then they got cortisone.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.100
And they could sell it in 1949
for $200 a gram, having made

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.433
it by a 32 step sequence.

00:36:47.433 --> 00:36:51.567
But there's another compound
called diosgenin.

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:55.467
And diosgenin also has the right
set of rings and the

00:36:55.467 --> 00:37:00.733
right stereochemistry, and
functionality in a good place.

00:37:00.733 --> 00:37:04.233
And it's abundant in
a Mexican yam.

00:37:04.233 --> 00:37:08.533
And Russell Marker, who was an
organic chemist at Penn State

00:37:08.533 --> 00:37:11.100
University, went exploring.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.767
He sort of quit and went down to
Mexico and looked around to

00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:18.333
see if he could find
natural things that

00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:19.467
contained a lot of this.

00:37:19.467 --> 00:37:22.400
And the roots of this yam--

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.700
some of them are 20 or 50
kilograms, and a fair

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:30.333
percentage of it
is this stuff.

00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:33.933
So he was able to find a
good source of this.

00:37:33.933 --> 00:37:37.567
And it could be converted in
five steps into progesterone,

00:37:37.567 --> 00:37:40.267
a female hormone.

00:37:40.267 --> 00:37:45.500
And so in 1943, he got ten tons
of that yam and from it,

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:49.067
made three kilograms of
progesterone, which was then

00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:50.767
worth a quarter million
dollars,

00:37:50.767 --> 00:37:54.500
which is-- in 1943, which
is like, I don't

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.600
know, $5 million now.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.133
He had the world's supply
of progesterone,

00:38:01.933 --> 00:38:03.567
which is a pregnancy hormone.

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:08.500
And so it was selling in 1955
for 48¢ a gram, instead of

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.233
this $200/gram stuff.

00:38:11.233 --> 00:38:13.500
But there's a problem if you
want to get cortisone this

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.267
way, because there's no foothold
to get at that

00:38:16.267 --> 00:38:18.567
position, rather than that one
or that one or that one or

00:38:18.567 --> 00:38:21.100
that one or that one or
that one or that one.

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.733
How are you going to
put the ketone in?

00:38:23.733 --> 00:38:27.700
And this is where it was found,
actually, by this guy

00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:29.900
here, or by his research
group.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.367
Frederick Heyl, who was an
undergraduate and graduate

00:38:32.367 --> 00:38:34.800
student here, was the director
of research at Upjohn.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.967
And at Upjohn research in
Kalamazoo, they found out that

00:38:38.967 --> 00:38:43.633
they had some of this-- a mold
started growing on a dish that

00:38:43.633 --> 00:38:45.300
was in a windowsill.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:46.867
And when you put it
on here, it put a

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:48.100
ketone in that position.

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:53.200
Pardon me.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.000
Put the alcohol in
that position.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.133
But then once you've got the
alcohol here, you're home

00:38:57.133 --> 00:38:58.367
free, right?

00:38:58.367 --> 00:38:59.733
OK.

00:38:59.733 --> 00:39:03.067
So Woodward had done the total
synthesis of cortisone, and he

00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:05.133
did a lot of total syntheses.

00:39:05.133 --> 00:39:08.367
Like the strychnine
synthesis here.

00:39:08.367 --> 00:39:11.233
I thank Professor Saunders,
who took these pictures.

00:39:11.233 --> 00:39:14.300
He was still a graduate student
at this time in 1954

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.700
when strychnine was
synthesized.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.367
And the interesting thing
about Woodward--

00:39:20.367 --> 00:39:23.300
there was real cult of
personality, still is, among

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:24.033
older people.

00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:26.233
Because young people don't
know who he was anymore.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.967
Because he was such an artist. I
mean, designing these things

00:39:34.967 --> 00:39:37.533
is an art, but you have to
really know a lot to

00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:38.767
see the art in it.

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:41.400
And his Nobel citation actually,
said "for his

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.333
outstanding achievements in the
art of organic synthesis."

00:39:45.333 --> 00:39:47.767
I don't think there's never been
another Nobel citation

00:39:47.767 --> 00:39:50.033
that said art in it.

00:39:50.033 --> 00:39:51.300
So he made a lot of
these things.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:54.533
Here was strychnine, a very
challenging thing.

00:39:54.533 --> 00:39:58.600
And so when they got it done,
they drew it very carefully on

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.633
the blackboard.

00:39:59.633 --> 00:40:02.167
And the postdocs who
had worked on it--

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:04.567
Ollis was a faculty member
from the University of

00:40:04.567 --> 00:40:05.900
Bristol, in England.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.467
Hunger was a German.

00:40:07.467 --> 00:40:10.933
Daeniker and Schenker were
from Switzerland.

00:40:10.933 --> 00:40:14.300
And Cava was an American
who went to be a

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:18.467
professor at Penn.

00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:24.367
But you'll notice, when Woodward
got the Nobel prize,

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:27.667
his colleagues wrote this
in Science magazine.

00:40:27.667 --> 00:40:31.300
"Woodward's style is polished,
showing an insight and sense

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:34.933
of proportion that afford him
strong convictions and a

00:40:34.933 --> 00:40:37.700
well-developed dramatic
sense."

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:41.067
So you can see, just the way
he's lighting his cigarette

00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:43.433
there looks sort of
dramatic to me.

00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:45.600
And look at his signature!

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.700
He always signed minuscule
signatures.

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.167
R. B. Woodward.

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:56.433
And they also put a check mark
on it when they finished the

00:40:56.433 --> 00:41:01.033
synthesis, and down in the
bottom wrote, "fecunt."

00:41:01.033 --> 00:41:03.567
So you know Latin.

00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:05.967
I talked to Victor Bers in
the classics department.

00:41:05.967 --> 00:41:08.333
That's not a proper
Latin word.

00:41:08.333 --> 00:41:12.133
But fecerunt means,
they made it.

00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:12.867
Right?

00:41:12.867 --> 00:41:15.733
So that's what-- they almost
got it right, evidently,

00:41:15.733 --> 00:41:17.267
writing that on the
blackboard.

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:22.200
But one of the hallmarks of
Woodward's style was that he

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.967
always wore the same color
blue suit and blue tie.

00:41:25.967 --> 00:41:29.467
So that's a Woodward blue tie.

00:41:29.467 --> 00:41:34.400
And in fact, students, one
Halloween, painted his parking

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.900
place that light blue.

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:40.733
And I know where they got the
paint, because I got it.

00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:45.467
OK.

00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:50.700
So then in 1973, they did this
real pinnacle of synthesis.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.967
They synthesized vitamin B12.

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:54.933
You can't imagine all
the problems that

00:41:54.933 --> 00:41:55.733
were faced by this.

00:41:55.733 --> 00:41:58.700
And it was a collaborative
work between Woodward and

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:02.033
Eschenmoser's laboratory at
the ETH in Zurich, in

00:42:02.033 --> 00:42:03.467
Switzerland.

00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:06.867
And in connection with this
work is where Woodward

00:42:06.867 --> 00:42:11.267
discovered stereochemical
control by orbital symmetry.

00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:13.200
Those are called the
Woodward-Hoffmann rules.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:15.367
You know, conrotation,
disrotation.

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:19.500
And it was while working on this
that he discovered that.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.967
They had 100 coworkers
at these two

00:42:21.967 --> 00:42:23.700
labs, working on this.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.800
All of them very,
very talented.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.367
Including this guy, Yoshito
Kishi, who was a faculty

00:42:29.367 --> 00:42:33.200
member from Nagoya University
who had come to work on this

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.200
project with Woodward.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.033
And this is what Woodward wrote
about him when, in Pure

00:42:39.033 --> 00:42:42.967
and Applied Chemistry in 1971,
he wrote about working on the

00:42:42.967 --> 00:42:44.433
B12 synthesis.

00:42:44.433 --> 00:42:47.567
"The first preparation of
corrigenolide afforded

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:50.067
striking testimony of the
experimental skill of its

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.400
discoverer, Dr. Yoshito Kishi.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.700
All the operations had to
be conducted with every

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.667
conceivable precaution in
respect to purity of reagents,

00:42:57.667 --> 00:43:00.267
exclusion of oxygen and
moisture, and with the

00:43:00.267 --> 00:43:01.867
greatest possible speed."

00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:04.433
So he was a real wizard
in the laboratory.

00:43:04.433 --> 00:43:07.833
And he then joined the Harvard
faculty after that, and then

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:10.333
succeeded Woodward as professor
at Harvard after

00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:12.300
Woodward's untimely death.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:14.433
And we've seen his
name before.

00:43:14.433 --> 00:43:15.033
Not for this.

00:43:15.033 --> 00:43:19.333
He ultimately synthesized
palytoxin, this compound,

00:43:19.333 --> 00:43:26.033
which has C-123, H-213, NO-53.

00:43:26.033 --> 00:43:30.067
It's got 42 functional groups
which were protected in eight

00:43:30.067 --> 00:43:30.967
different ways.

00:43:30.967 --> 00:43:32.900
So you could remove
some of them, put

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.900
others on, and so on.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:38.100
It has 62 stereogenic centers.

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:42.500
It has seven double bonds that
could be either E or Z, so

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:46.933
there are 10 to the 20th
stereoisomers possible.

00:43:46.933 --> 00:43:48.500
And it was done convergently.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.300
So they made eight different
pieces and then put those

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.167
pieces together.

00:43:53.167 --> 00:43:56.167
So you'd get no yield at all
if you did this in a

00:43:56.167 --> 00:43:58.033
sequential synthesis, right?

00:43:58.033 --> 00:44:00.467
But they actually made it.

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:04.700
And it was not-- although that
was just a tour de force, it's

00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.200
related to practical stuff.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:11.500
Because we talked last fall
about this Eisai drug, which

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:14.067
has a lot of similarity
to that.

00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:17.833
And the week after we spoke
about it in class, the FDA

00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:20.933
approved it for treating
metastatic breast cancer.

00:44:20.933 --> 00:44:22.667
Remember we talked about
whether that was

00:44:22.667 --> 00:44:24.167
pending at the time.

00:44:24.167 --> 00:44:26.233
And you'll notice that
the leader of

00:44:26.233 --> 00:44:28.333
this group was Kishi.

00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:32.167
So he had cut his teeth on
palytoxin for synthesizing

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:35.667
things like this, so that this
drug can now be made

00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:39.733
synthetically, practically, and
sold as a drug that way.

00:44:39.733 --> 00:44:42.567
It's just incredible.

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:46.167
So organic synthesis has come
a long way from urea.

00:44:46.167 --> 00:44:50.000
Remember what Woehler wrote to
Berzelius in 1828 about the

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.400
experiment when he reacted
"cyanic acid with ammonia and

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.400
a crystalline substance appears
which is inert,

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.400
behaving neither like cyanate
nor like ammonia."

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.333
So that's the story.

00:45:02.333 --> 00:45:06.233
But first, that a little bit
of thanks and credit.

00:45:06.233 --> 00:45:08.700
First to George Maxfield,
who was my high

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.033
school chemistry teacher.

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:17.300
I remember his doing--

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.967
we'd be working on something,
and he wouldn't be doing

00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:19.533
anything at all.

00:45:19.533 --> 00:45:20.800
He'd go like this.

00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:27.933
And the other thing he did was
he said, "You make something,

00:45:27.933 --> 00:45:31.933
you put it in a bottle and sell
it to your neighbor." So

00:45:31.933 --> 00:45:34.267
I'm quoting him.

00:45:34.267 --> 00:45:38.000
And there's Theodore Roosevelt
Williams, who was my first

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.067
college professor at the College
of Worcester.

00:45:41.067 --> 00:45:45.833
And then Fieser we talked
about, and Bartlett, and

00:45:45.833 --> 00:45:51.167
Conant was his boss, who had two
PhD advisors, a physical

00:45:51.167 --> 00:45:53.800
chemist, T.W. Richards, who got
the Nobel Prize, and an

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.633
organic chemist, E. P. Kohler,
who was very--

00:45:56.633 --> 00:45:59.500
these three pictures were
all taken at Yale.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:02.200
That was when Sterling
was dedicated.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:09.133
This was at a meeting in 1931
when Bartlett was just 24 years

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:13.800
old. But Kohler never went
to meetings.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.367
He never left Harvard.

00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:18.167
People would come there to talk
to him, but he wasn't

00:46:18.167 --> 00:46:18.633
interested in that.

00:46:18.633 --> 00:46:21.233
He just taught all the time.

00:46:21.233 --> 00:46:26.200
And Kohler's the one that
finally resolved aline.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.267
Remember, we talked about that
van 't Hoff had predicted it.

00:46:30.267 --> 00:46:32.233
But Kohler's the one
that made it.

00:46:32.233 --> 00:46:34.400
So Kohler was a student
of Remson, who

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.933
was at Johns Hopkins.

00:46:35.933 --> 00:46:37.833
And Richards studied
with Ostwald.

00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:41.033
Remember, the guy that didn't
believe in atoms?

00:46:41.033 --> 00:46:44.967
And then the next generation
back was Fittig, who

00:46:44.967 --> 00:46:48.700
discovered the pinacol
reaction.

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:52.967
And the one person I couldn't
find a picture of was Carl

00:46:52.967 --> 00:46:56.167
Schmidt, who was at
Riga in Latvia.

00:46:56.167 --> 00:46:59.067
But he was described by Ostwald
as a "tall, thin man

00:46:59.067 --> 00:47:02.067
with a small head, a strong
nose, ice gray hair, and a

00:47:02.067 --> 00:47:05.467
thin beard." And a very
nice person, right?

00:47:05.467 --> 00:47:08.967
And Schimdt had worked both
with Liebig and Woehler.

00:47:08.967 --> 00:47:10.667
He was first a student
of Woehler, who

00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:12.267
recommended him to Liebig.

00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:14.233
Fittig had worked
with Woehler.

00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:16.200
So we're back to those guys.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.067
And then to Gay-Lussac
and Berzelius.

00:47:19.067 --> 00:47:23.800
And then to Bertole, who was a
colleague of Lavoisier, and

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.667
wrote how to name compounds.

00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:30.333
But there are some other heroes
to whom we should pay

00:47:30.333 --> 00:47:33.467
homage, even if they weren't
our ancestors.

00:47:33.467 --> 00:47:35.000
You know who this is?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:35.800
STUDENT: Moses Gomberg

00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.067
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.133
Who's this?

00:47:41.133 --> 00:47:43.200
Emil Fischer.

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.400
The last lecture.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:46.533
Koerner.

00:47:46.533 --> 00:47:51.133
The other guy who did a real
proof in the 19th century.

00:47:51.133 --> 00:47:52.400
James Clark Maxwell.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:58.300
Remember him?

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.500
Couper.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.433
The tetravalence of carbon.

00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:04.833
Lavoisier.

00:48:04.833 --> 00:48:07.167
And Robert Hooke.

00:48:07.167 --> 00:48:11.467
There's no known picture of
Hooke, because Newton probably

00:48:11.467 --> 00:48:12.733
destroyed it.

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:17.667
I think that's true!

00:48:17.667 --> 00:48:20.367
But this is a picture
of somebody

00:48:20.367 --> 00:48:22.400
using Hooke's apparatus.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.033
And Hooke was a hunchback,
and he drew that picture.

00:48:25.033 --> 00:48:27.933
And I like to think that might
be a self-portrait, although I

00:48:27.933 --> 00:48:29.800
sort of doubt it.

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.367
But Hooke was certainly
a great guy.

00:48:31.367 --> 00:48:34.100
And then of course we have a lot
of people we have to pay

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.133
homage to at Yale, too.

00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:39.400
Like Silliman, with his T-shirts
that says, "How do

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.633
you know?"

00:48:41.633 --> 00:48:43.500
Or a giant.

00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:44.567
Who's this?

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:44.867
STUDENT: Gibbs

00:48:44.867 --> 00:48:47.233
PROFESSOR: Gibbs.

00:48:47.233 --> 00:48:48.633
And Onsager.

00:48:48.633 --> 00:48:49.667
Those two--

00:48:49.667 --> 00:48:54.967
Gibbs was arguably the smartest
guy in the 19th

00:48:54.967 --> 00:48:58.033
century, or certainly among
the top half dozen or so.

00:48:58.033 --> 00:49:01.467
And Onsager was the same
in this century.

00:49:01.467 --> 00:49:03.700
And I actually had Onsager
as a colleague.

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.767
We overlapped for a few years.

00:49:06.767 --> 00:49:12.200
I mean, he's-- like, Feynman
was in awe of Onsager.

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.000
And when Onsager got the Nobel
Prize, when they called to

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.200
inform him, he asked, "What
for?" Because he had done so

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:22.133
many things that could have
gotten the Nobel Prize.

00:49:22.133 --> 00:49:25.800
And then, you know this is?

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.467
Chupka.

00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:28.667
These are the colleagues
I've enjoyed having

00:49:28.667 --> 00:49:29.500
around for a while.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.067
And he came in and told people
how he determined the heat of

00:49:32.067 --> 00:49:34.733
vaporization of carbon.

00:49:34.733 --> 00:49:36.567
And that one, you know.

00:49:36.567 --> 00:49:38.567
Wiberg.

00:49:38.567 --> 00:49:41.933
And here's Professors Ziegler.

00:49:41.933 --> 00:49:45.367
These are people who gave
lectures in the course, right?

00:49:45.367 --> 00:49:47.167
And of course, you
know who's next.

00:49:47.167 --> 00:49:50.000
Not a faculty member, but a
graduate student from Yale.

00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:55.767
And then someone who's
almost from Yale.

00:49:55.767 --> 00:49:56.933
Leslie Leiserowitz

00:49:56.933 --> 00:49:58.300
who spoke to you
last semester.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.800
He's from Israel, but he comes
so often to visit that we'll

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.967
call him an honorary Yalie.

00:50:04.967 --> 00:50:09.300
And then these people
we quoted.

00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:11.100
Remember, he's the guy
that originated "How

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:14.133
do you know" hourly?

00:50:14.133 --> 00:50:17.533
And she's the one that
does it now.

00:50:17.533 --> 00:50:21.267
And this is my wife, and
that's John's wife.

00:50:21.267 --> 00:50:25.400
And here's-- this was night
before last over across the

00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:28.833
street here, at a meeting of
the Connecticut Science

00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:32.100
Teachers Association,
when this plaque was

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.300
awarded to my wife.

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:36.767
And she's sitting back here.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.500
And next to her is the Biology
professor from Bowdoin whom

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:50.667
I've quoted.

00:50:50.667 --> 00:50:52.267
And she's sitting
back there, too.

00:50:59.267 --> 00:51:01.367
And then these are the kids--

00:51:01.367 --> 00:51:03.367
it's the next generation,
right?

00:51:03.367 --> 00:51:05.367
And they're here with
Caroline Doty.

00:51:05.367 --> 00:51:09.700
You know who Caroline Doty is,
a basketball player at UConn.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:10.700
So we'd gone to a UConn game.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.700
So I don't know what they're
going to do.

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.367
They might be scientists.

00:51:14.367 --> 00:51:16.700
They might be basketball
players.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:20.000
They might be lawyers,
doctors.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.700
But you guys are going
to be that, too.

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:27.133
And you're going to be their
teachers, or their healers, or

00:51:27.133 --> 00:51:29.900
Lord forbid, defend them in
court, or something like that.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:33.200
OK.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.767
So there you are.

00:51:34.767 --> 00:51:36.567
So I want to thank
all the students.

00:51:36.567 --> 00:51:38.400
Not only you guys,
but many years.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:44.833
So thanks.

00:51:44.833 --> 00:51:47.767
We'll have a review on
Monday in room 110.

00:51:47.767 --> 00:51:49.500
There's going to be
a symposium here.

00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.267
So at class time on Monday,
we'll have a

00:51:51.267 --> 00:51:52.800
review down the hall.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.533
And good luck on the final,
and that's it.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.633
Thank you.

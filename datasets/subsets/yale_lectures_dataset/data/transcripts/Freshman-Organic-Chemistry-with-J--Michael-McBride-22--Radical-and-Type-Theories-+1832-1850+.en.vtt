00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.325
Prof: So in 1832,
as we saw at the end last time,

00:00:06.325 --> 00:00:10.750
WÃ¶hler went to work for
most of a month with Liebig,

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.550
and together they worked on the
oil of bitter almonds,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.410
which is making its way around
-- it's benzaldehyde --

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.110
which is making its way around
here.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.420
So there's the bottle that's
coming around.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.360
What did you notice about it?
 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.340
Where is it?
 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.220
What do you notice about it
Devin?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.710
Student:
&gt;

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.710
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.810
Student:  About the
smell?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.180
Prof: What does it smell
like?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720
Is it almonds?
 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.743
Turn it around,
look at the -- turn it upside

00:00:55.743 --> 00:00:57.020
down.
 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.100
What do you notice?
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.228
Student:  There's a
little bit of solid in the

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:02.770
bottom.
 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.019
Prof: Yeah,
it's half solid.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.620
Benzaldehyde is the oil
of bitter almonds;

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.230
not the solid of bitter almonds.
 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.640
What does it say on the label,
written by hand?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.090
Somebody's initials, J.W.
 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.069
Student: J.W., 11/29/95.
 

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:25.019
Prof: So it was opened
in 1995, thirteen years ago.

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:27.049
When it was opened it was a
liquid.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.239
Now it's half solid.
 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:33.680
How do you figure that?
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.580
Well something must've happened.
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.950
So what did it react with,
in the bottle?

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.720
Yoonjoo?
 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.750
Student:  Oxygen.
 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.069
Prof: Oxygen.
 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.019
Okay?
 

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:48.140
So oil of bitter almonds;
they analyzed,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.980
C_7H_6O, and they found that it
reacted with oxygen to get

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.180
C_7H_6O_2.
 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.379
Right?
 

00:01:57.379 --> 00:01:59.260
They also reacted it with
bromine.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.108
The halogens were common,
as we'll see,

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:02.519
for reagents in those days.
 

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:05.760
Got C_7H_5OBr.
 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.976
They reacted it with chlorine,
and also that product with

00:02:09.976 --> 00:02:13.590
potassium iodide,
or ammonia, or lead sulfide.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.340
And they got all these
compounds.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.780
And what did they do with them
when they got them?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.750
They smelled them. Right?
 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.659
What was the main thing they
did?

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.080
Student:  Tasted it.
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.818
Prof: No that's not the
--

00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:26.520
it's true that they probably
tasted,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.270
that they tasted them,
but that's not the main thing

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.580
they did that gave them unique
information.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.560
Student:  Weight.
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.840
Prof: What about the
weight?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.434
What was the main technique
that we've been talking about

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:44.129
all the time?
 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:44.940
Dana?
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.878
Student:  The analysis
of combustion.

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.460
Prof: They did an
elemental analysis;

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.780
ultimate analysis of what the
ratio of the elements.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.940
So that's what they had. Right?
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.128
So big deal.
 

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:55.879
What do you get from the
analysis?

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.819
What can you infer?
 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.008
Here were these guys;
you could now compete with

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:01.680
them, right?
 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.393
This is what they found out
during that month of

00:03:04.393 --> 00:03:07.837
experimentation,
and they came up with a theory

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.968
that revolutionized organic
chemistry,

00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:14.409
as of that time and for the
next twenty years.

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:29.810
So what did they notice?
 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.120
Claire?
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.680
Student: They noticed
the carbon chains.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.470
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.770
Student: The carbon
chains.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.669
Prof: Well how would you
know it's a chain?

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:39.520
The numbers don't tell you it's
a chain.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.550
What?
 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.990
Student: The presence of
the hydrocarbons.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.265
Prof: Well it's,
it's got hydrogen and carbon in

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:46.569
it.
 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.440
That's true.
 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.016
But they also have oxygen and
nitrogen, chlorine and other

00:03:52.016 --> 00:03:52.740
things.
 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.550
What could you make out of this?
 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.050
Brian?
 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.590
Student: C_7H_5.
 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.919
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.780
All of them have at least
C_7H_5.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.877
Some of them have more hydrogen
than that, but nothing has less

00:04:09.877 --> 00:04:12.180
than C_7 or less than H_5.
 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.330
Can anybody carry that any
further?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.569
Student: C_7H_5 is
non-reactive.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:18.209
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.329
Student: It's non -- the
C_7H_5 is the unreactive part.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.017
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:04:23.017 --> 00:04:27.531
What would they have called it;
the thing that you have it

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.149
there and then it reacts and
gives this, that,

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:31.430
or the other thing?
 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.009
What did Lavoisier call it?
 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.350
Student:  The radical.
 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.690
Prof: The base,
or the radical.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.252
But actually the radical is
more than C_7H_5,

00:04:42.252 --> 00:04:44.949
the thing that persists.
 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.550
What else?
 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.730
Prof: O.
 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.610
So C_7H_5O persists through all
these transformations.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.910
So it looks like that's some
sort of a core that gets

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.819
modified.
 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:00.240
Okay?
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.990
But it's there all the time.
 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.660
It's like a radical. Right?
 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.860
So it was called the benzoyl
radical.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.180
They thought up that name at
that time, and the idea of using

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.420
the suffix -yl,
to denote a radical.

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.069
So if you denote the benzoyl
radical by Bz --

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:26.858
you see that you started,
the oil of bitter almonds is

00:05:26.858 --> 00:05:29.903
BzH,
and then the acid is BzOH,

00:05:29.903 --> 00:05:35.579
and the acid chloride is BzCl
and Br and I and NH_2 and two

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:40.529
Bz's,
together with S, at the end.

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:42.120
Okay?
 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.125
So a radical can be the base of
more than just an acid.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:46.720
Right?
 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.877
Lavoisier had the idea that you
react it with oxygen and you get

00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:50.379
an acid.
 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.798
But here you can react it with
all sorts of different things

00:05:52.798 --> 00:05:54.029
and get different compounds.
 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:58.449
But the base is still there,
the benzoyl radical.

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:02.180
So this gave rise to the idea
of organic dualism.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.000
Remember, we had this dualism
last time.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.867
There were positive things and
negative things and they could

00:06:07.867 --> 00:06:09.350
associate and trade partners.
 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.199
But maybe the difference in
organic chemistry is that you

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.956
have radicals,
things that are plus or minus,

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:21.528
but they're more complicated
than just single atoms.

00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:23.922
There are combinations of
elements that function in

00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:25.930
organic chemistry;
and that's what makes it

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.209
different from inorganic,
according to this theory.

00:06:28.209 --> 00:06:31.995
So then the idea is to find all
these organic radicals,

00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:34.660
that make organic chemistry
special.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.101
So during the 1830s these
compound radicals were

00:06:38.101 --> 00:06:39.860
discovered everywhere.
 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.788
For example,
in Germany, Liebig found

00:06:42.788 --> 00:06:43.519
acetyl.
 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:47.000
And Bunsen, in Heidelberg,
found cacodyl;

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.793
which is named because it
smells so awful.

00:06:49.793 --> 00:06:50.339
Right?
 

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:53.230
Or Berzelius in Sweden found
ethyl.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:58.220
Or Piria in Italy got salicyl.
 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.752
And Dumas got a whole bunch of
them, in Paris:

00:07:01.752 --> 00:07:04.579
methyl, cinnamyl,
cetyl, ethylene.

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.269
All these radicals were
discovered.

00:07:06.269 --> 00:07:09.163
So the thought was this is the
way to organize organic

00:07:09.163 --> 00:07:09.819
chemistry.
 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.574
And that theory,
the dualism applied to organic

00:07:13.574 --> 00:07:17.490
theory, the radical theory,
survives today in our

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:18.552
nomenclature.
 

00:07:18.552 --> 00:07:19.449
Right?
 

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:22.629
So, for example,
we talk about ethyl chloride.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.730
That's not one word,
it's two words,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.882
with a space.
 

00:07:26.882 --> 00:07:27.680
Right?
 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.790
And the reason is it's
dualistic.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.007
It's a positive ethyl and a
minus chlorine.

00:07:33.007 --> 00:07:33.620
Right?
 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.829
So it's two things that have
come together.

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:41.637
Okay, now the -yl part,
that WÃ¶hler and Liebig

00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:44.740
thought up,
comes from a Greek word,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.620
Ã¼leh,
which means wood or matter.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.240
So it's the substance of stuff.
 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.884
Okay, so now ether was
something that had been known

00:07:54.884 --> 00:07:58.101
for a long time,
and it came from a Greek root

00:07:58.101 --> 00:07:59.889
which means to shine.
 

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:04.778
So in the 1700s it was -- so it
had been applied to the sky.

00:08:04.778 --> 00:08:07.552
It was transferred from the
idea of shining,

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:11.230
to the idea of the clear sky,
and from that to a colorless

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.939
liquid.
 

00:08:11.939 --> 00:08:15.598
So when they distilled
something out of alcohol that

00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:19.336
had been treated with acid,
and they got this clear stuff

00:08:19.336 --> 00:08:22.519
that was clear as the sky,
they called it ether. Right?

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:26.269
Which we call diethyl ether
nowadays.

00:08:26.269 --> 00:08:27.964
So that's where
"ether"

00:08:27.964 --> 00:08:28.600
came from.
 

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.899
So hence eth-yl was the
matter that appears in ether.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:38.993
So it was like two benzoyl
radicals with sulfur.

00:08:38.993 --> 00:08:39.690
Right?
 

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.998
You can have two ethyl radicals
with oxygen.

00:08:43.998 --> 00:08:44.798
Right?
 

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:47.620
And that was then eth-yl
-- right?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.419
-- the material of ether.
 

00:08:50.419 --> 00:08:51.009
Okay?
 

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.000
How about methyl?
 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.371
Well meth comes from the
Greek word meaning wine or

00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:56.908
spirit.
 

00:08:56.908 --> 00:08:57.600
Right?
 

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.392
And the -yl,
that same root,

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:01.288
but a different meaning this
time.

00:09:01.288 --> 00:09:04.910
Remember, it can mean matter --
that was the one before -- or it

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.668
can mean wood,
and in this case it means wood.

00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:11.136
So what does it mean,
meth-yl,

00:09:11.136 --> 00:09:17.110
if the -yl means not the
substance of but means wood?

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.120
Student: From wood.
 

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.629
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:09:18.629 --> 00:09:19.549
Student:  From wood.
 

00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:20.080
Prof: From wood.
 

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.049
What from wood?
 

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:22.330
Student:  Wine.
 

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.389
Prof: The spirits,
from wood.

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:27.610
So you've heard methanol called
wood alcohol -- right?

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.970
-- because you get it from
distilling it.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:35.509
But the first word was
methylene, and ene is the

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:40.030
Greek feminine patronymic;
it means "the daughter

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.450
of."
 

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:42.344
And ene,
ine, one,

00:09:42.344 --> 00:09:44.999
all of those are like that;
like Persephone,

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:48.852
or Antigone means the "one
who goes against her

00:09:48.852 --> 00:09:50.970
parents,"
and so on.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.259
So ene was the Greek --
so what did meth-yl-ene mean?

00:09:56.259 --> 00:10:00.230
It meant the daughter of wood
spirits.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:03.947
So the theory was that wood
spirits, that is,

00:10:03.947 --> 00:10:07.581
wood alcohol,
was a combination of methylene

00:10:07.581 --> 00:10:08.850
plus water.
 

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.399
So methylene thus,
if wood alcohol is CH_3OH,

00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:18.466
then methylene was
CH_2_; which then you

00:10:18.466 --> 00:10:22.500
add water and you get wood
alcohol.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.154
So that's where the name
methylene came from.

00:10:26.154 --> 00:10:26.820
Right?
 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.520
So then in 1840 -- that was
1835, so five years later --

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.710
they decided that they needed
the radical CH_3.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.409
So they named it methyl,
from methylene.

00:10:39.409 --> 00:10:40.169
Right?
 

00:10:40.169 --> 00:10:44.576
And then ethylene came;
that name came in 1852,

00:10:44.576 --> 00:10:48.841
because it was related to
ethyl, which had already been

00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:53.580
named, the same way that
methylene was related to methyl.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.029
Okay?
 

00:10:54.029 --> 00:10:56.129
So that's where these names
came from.

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:59.769
They all have their root in the
radical theory.

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:02.590
Now, that's C_1 and C_2,
methyl and ethyl.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:07.789
How about C_3 and C_4,
do you know what they're named?

00:11:07.789 --> 00:11:08.450
Roots?
 

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.985
How about C_3,
do you know what C _3 alcohol

00:11:10.985 --> 00:11:11.279
is?
 

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:11.870
Students:  Propyl.
 

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.620
Prof: Propyl.
 

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.580
And C_4?
 

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.519
Students:  Butyl.
 

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:15.328
Prof: Butyl.
 

00:11:15.328 --> 00:11:16.820
So where do those names come
from?

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.974
Okay, C_3H_7_ is
propyl, and by the same

00:11:20.974 --> 00:11:24.620
reasoning as before,
C_3H_6 is propylene;

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:27.559
or propene, sometimes it
shortened.

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:28.000
Okay?
 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.918
And butyl and butylene,
or butene.

00:11:31.918 --> 00:11:36.269
Okay, now butylene comes -- the
C_4 acid is butyric acid,

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:40.619
which had already been named,
because it's the stuff that

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:43.259
makes rancid butter smell bad.
 

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:43.379
Okay?
 

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:46.629
So people worked it up and
found butyric acid;

00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:48.889
so that's where butyl comes
from.

00:11:48.889 --> 00:11:49.830
But how about propyl?
 

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.100
It has a very much more
interesting origin.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.932
Okay, so protos means
first, and pion means

00:11:57.932 --> 00:11:58.450
fat.
 

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:02.659
So propion was the first fat.
 

00:12:02.659 --> 00:12:03.820
In what sense?
 

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.876
Well these carboxylic acids
came from fats,

00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:07.460
right?
 

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.509
And they were called fatty
acids.

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:12.851
And they behaved like fats,
they dissolved in organic

00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:13.431
solvents.
 

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:14.009
Right?
 

00:12:14.009 --> 00:12:17.360
But the very -- the ones with
the fewest number of carbons,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.889
with just one carbon -- that's
formic acid that you get by

00:12:20.889 --> 00:12:23.120
destructive distillation of
ants,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:27.397
or acetic acid,
from vinegar -- those are

00:12:27.397 --> 00:12:29.750
miscible with water.
 

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:33.721
But the C_3 is the first one
that's not freely miscible with

00:12:33.721 --> 00:12:36.164
water;
it behaves more like a fat.

00:12:36.164 --> 00:12:36.658
Right?
 

00:12:36.658 --> 00:12:41.720
So the first fatty acid is
propionic acid.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.950
So propyl, propylene are the
C_3s.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:51.808
Okay, after that you get into
numbers, the roots for numbers.

00:12:51.808 --> 00:12:58.316
So Jean-Baptiste AndrÃ©
Dumas was the successor of

00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:04.350
Gay-Lussac as the spokesman for
French chemistry.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.221
You see, he was born on the
14th of July,

00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:11.168
a reasonable date for somebody
to lead French chemistry,

00:13:11.168 --> 00:13:12.028
in 1800.
 

00:13:12.028 --> 00:13:15.835
So for eighty-four years --
well, for part of eighty-four

00:13:15.835 --> 00:13:19.028
years, he was the leader of
French chemistry.

00:13:19.028 --> 00:13:22.509
There he is with some
decoration on him.

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:23.320
I'm not sure what it is.
 

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.288
I'd like to find out.
 

00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:31.346
So he was the Post-Napoleonic
guardian of the French tradition

00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:32.590
of chemistry.
 

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:38.210
The French had what most people
regard as a terrible system,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:43.259
which is they had chairs,
you know, for professors.

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:45.639
But you could have more than
one chair.

00:13:45.639 --> 00:13:48.753
So a single individual could
tie up three different

00:13:48.753 --> 00:13:51.395
appointments,
and you didn't have as many

00:13:51.395 --> 00:13:54.567
people able to exercise their
ingenuity in developing

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:55.360
chemistry.
 

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.480
So he had the chair at the
Sorbonne;

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.860
also the Ãcole
Polytechnique and the

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.788
Ãcole de MÃ©dicine.
 

00:14:02.788 --> 00:14:07.288
And he was a persistent
opponent of Liebig and

00:14:07.288 --> 00:14:08.490
Berzelius.
 

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.586
But in 1837,
after this radical stuff got

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:13.658
going --
and he had discovered four

00:14:13.658 --> 00:14:16.971
radicals himself,
of which he was quite pleased

00:14:16.971 --> 00:14:21.692
-- he and Liebig happened to
meet during a speaking tour in

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:24.278
England,
and they got in conversation,

00:14:24.278 --> 00:14:26.933
and Dumas decided,
on the basis of that meeting --

00:14:26.933 --> 00:14:29.304
though not Liebig --
that they were now great

00:14:29.304 --> 00:14:31.899
friends and could collaborate
from here on in.

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:34.964
So he wrote this long thing,
in flowery French,

00:14:34.964 --> 00:14:38.427
in 1837, "A Note on the
Present State of Organic

00:14:38.427 --> 00:14:39.759
Chemistry."
 

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:43.080
So this is five years after the
Radical Theory began.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.303
He said: "Sixty years have
hardly passed since the ever

00:14:46.303 --> 00:14:48.652
memorable time when this same
assembly"

00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:52.110
--
he was speaking to the Paris

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:54.541
Academy --
"heard the first

00:14:54.541 --> 00:14:57.744
discussions of the fertile
chemical doctrine which we owe

00:14:57.744 --> 00:14:59.460
to the genius of Lavoisier.
 

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.706
This short span of time has
sufficed to examine fully the

00:15:03.706 --> 00:15:07.500
most delicate questions of
inorganic chemistry,

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:11.087
and anyone can easily convince
himself that this branch of our

00:15:11.087 --> 00:15:14.440
knowledge possesses almost
everything that it can with the

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.970
methods of observation
available."

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.799
So check off inorganic
chemistry, we've got that now.

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.500
Okay?
 

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.952
"There barely remain a few
cracks here and there to fill

00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:26.769
in."
 

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:32.129
So this is the persistent
myopia of leaders of science.

00:15:32.129 --> 00:15:35.804
As I mentioned before,
when we were speaking of

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:39.639
Lavoisier, this certainly
persists 'til today.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:43.210
So Dumas goes on:
"In a word,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:46.072
how with the help of the laws
of inorganic chemistry can"

00:15:46.072 --> 00:15:46.998
--
incidentally,

00:15:46.998 --> 00:15:49.100
this is all one sentence,
of course.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.658
This is "in a word",
right?

00:15:50.658 --> 00:15:53.379
So he really liked speaking,
right?;

00:15:53.379 --> 00:15:55.129
flowery language.
 

00:15:55.129 --> 00:15:58.565
"How with the help of the
laws of inorganic chemistry can

00:15:58.565 --> 00:16:02.000
one explain and classify such
varied substances as one obtains

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.897
from organic bodies,
and which nearly always are

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.326
formed only of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen,

00:16:07.326 --> 00:16:10.168
to which elements nitrogen is
sometimes joined?"

00:16:10.168 --> 00:16:14.231
So if it's all in the analysis
of what atoms are there,

00:16:14.231 --> 00:16:17.317
how can you have so many
different things?

00:16:17.317 --> 00:16:18.070
Right?
 

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.148
"This was the great and
beautiful question of natural

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.917
philosophy,
a question well designed to

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:27.860
excite the highest degree of
competition among

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.039
chemists."
 

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:33.379
Name two, right?
 

00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:36.065
"For once resolved the
most beautiful triumphs were

00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:37.139
promised to science.
 

00:16:37.139 --> 00:16:39.964
The mysteries of plants,
the mysteries of animal life

00:16:39.964 --> 00:16:41.918
would be unveiled before our
eyes;

00:16:41.918 --> 00:16:45.086
we would seize the key to all
the changes of matter,

00:16:45.086 --> 00:16:47.072
so sudden, so swift,
so singular,

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:49.370
that occur in animals and
plants;

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:53.544
more importantly we would find
means of duplicating them in our

00:16:53.544 --> 00:16:54.960
laboratories."
 

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.043
(This would make a good
research proposal,

00:16:58.043 --> 00:16:58.720
right?)
 

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.269
"Well, we are not afraid
to say it,

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:04.558
and it is not an assertion
which we make lightly:

00:17:04.558 --> 00:17:08.259
this great and beautiful
question is today answered;

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:11.672
it only remains to follow
through on all the consequences

00:17:11.672 --> 00:17:13.440
which the solution entails.
 

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.930
In fact to produce with three
or four elements such varied

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:19.438
combinations,
more varied perhaps than those

00:17:19.438 --> 00:17:21.680
which make up the whole
inorganic kingdom,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.700
nature has chosen a path as
simple as it was unexpected;

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.904
for with elements she has made
compounds which behave in all

00:17:29.904 --> 00:17:33.470
their properties like elements
themselves."

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:35.400
(That is, radicals -- right?
 

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.430
-- that persist through these
reactions.)

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.836
"And this,
we are convinced,

00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:46.160
is the entire secret of organic
chemistry."

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.818
Great and beautiful questions
to answer.

00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:51.259
It only remains to follow
through the consequences;

00:17:51.259 --> 00:17:52.848
compounds which behave like
elements.

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:56.210
"Thus organic chemistry
possesses in its own elements,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.288
which sometimes play the role
of chlorine or oxygen"

00:17:59.288 --> 00:18:01.029
--
what does he mean,

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:04.240
play the role of chlorine and
oxygen?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.410
How come radicals sometimes
play the role of chlorine and

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.920
oxygen?
 

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.608
What would that role be?
 

00:18:09.608 --> 00:18:11.269
Student:
&gt;

00:18:11.269 --> 00:18:12.200
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.509
Student: Oxidation.
 

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:16.818
Prof: No.
 

00:18:16.818 --> 00:18:22.789
What roles do things play in
this theory that he's using?

00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:24.150
Lucas?
 

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.630
Student:  Plus and minus.
 

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:25.759
Prof: Plus and minus.
 

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:27.589
So sometimes they're like
chlorine or oxygen.

00:18:27.589 --> 00:18:28.740
What does that mean?
 

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.710
Students:  Negative.
 

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.108
Prof: Sometimes they're
negative, right?

00:18:32.108 --> 00:18:33.890
"And sometimes,
on the contrary,

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.720
they play the role of
metals."

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.220
Sometimes they're positive.
 

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.150
"Cyanogen, amide, benzoyl,
the radicals of ammonia,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.711
of aliphatics,
of alcohol, and analogous

00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:46.077
substances,
these are the true elements

00:18:46.077 --> 00:18:48.430
with which organic chemistry
operates.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.231
To discover these radicals,
to study them,

00:18:51.231 --> 00:18:54.582
to characterize them,
has been our daily study for

00:18:54.582 --> 00:18:55.950
ten years."
 

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:56.507
(Okay?
 

00:18:56.507 --> 00:18:59.849
So they're plus and they're
minus.)

00:18:59.849 --> 00:19:04.188
"Sometimes, none the less,
our opinions have appeared to

00:19:04.188 --> 00:19:06.483
differ,
and then, with each of us drawn

00:19:06.483 --> 00:19:08.460
on by the heat of our battle
with nature,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.845
there arose between us
discussions whose liveliness we

00:19:11.845 --> 00:19:12.740
both regret.
 

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.854
Actually when we were able to
discuss questions which

00:19:15.854 --> 00:19:18.548
separated us in several friendly
meetings,

00:19:18.548 --> 00:19:20.852
we soon realized that we were
in agreement on the

00:19:20.852 --> 00:19:21.858
principlesÃ¢â¬Â¦.
 

00:19:21.858 --> 00:19:25.740
We then understood that united
we could undertake a task before

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.618
which either of us in isolation
would have recoiledÃ¢â¬Â¦.

00:19:29.618 --> 00:19:32.828
We will analyze every organic
substance...

00:19:32.828 --> 00:19:36.369
to establish reliably what sort
of radical it refers

00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:37.690
toÃ¢â¬Â¦."
 

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.788
So that is what everybody
should do.

00:19:39.788 --> 00:19:41.990
Then you'll know all about
organic chemistry.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:45.429
"Each of us has,
in fact, opened his laboratory

00:19:45.429 --> 00:19:48.799
to all young men who were
motivated by true love of

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.548
science;
they have seen all,

00:19:50.548 --> 00:19:51.338
understood all.
 

00:19:51.338 --> 00:19:54.881
We have worked under their
eyes, and have had them work

00:19:54.881 --> 00:19:57.364
under ours,
in such a way that we are

00:19:57.364 --> 00:20:00.634
surrounded by young rivals,
who are the hope of science,

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:03.750
and whose work will be added to
ours and mingle with ours,

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.748
for it will have been conceived
in the same spirit and carried

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:09.650
out by the same method."
 

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.240
Right?
 

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.424
So if everybody does what we
say they should do,

00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:15.940
then we got it.
 

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.058
Okay?
 

00:20:17.058 --> 00:20:20.765
"This is not an effort
conceived for personal gain or

00:20:20.765 --> 00:20:23.430
in the interest of narrow
vanity."

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.568
Far be it from us.
 

00:20:25.568 --> 00:20:28.073
"No, and in a
collaboration which is perhaps

00:20:28.073 --> 00:20:30.160
unheard of in the history of
science,

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.484
this is an undertaking in which
we hope to interest every

00:20:33.484 --> 00:20:35.029
chemist in Europe."
 

00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:37.140
So everyone should work on this.
 

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.336
So we'll go to the funding
agencies and tell them this is

00:20:40.336 --> 00:20:42.848
the only kind of research you
should fund;

00:20:42.848 --> 00:20:44.700
forget these other guys out
there.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.980
This is true love of
science, right?

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.969
And conceived in the same
spirit and carried out by the

00:20:50.969 --> 00:20:51.798
same methods.
 

00:20:51.798 --> 00:20:56.039
So this is megalomania,
and doesn't show much

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:57.390
imagination.
 

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.380
Now, but there was a problem
with dualism.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.526
So, for example,
suppose you have benzoyl

00:21:03.526 --> 00:21:06.489
chloride,
which remember was by reacting

00:21:06.489 --> 00:21:10.200
benzaldehyde or benzoyl hydride
with chlorine,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.480
and you get benzoyl chloride
and HCl as the other product.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.990
Now HCl is quite clear,
it's H+ and Cl-.

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.950
What's benzoyl chloride?
 

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:23.230
It's obviously benzoyl+ and Cl-.
 

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.490
And what problem does that
create?

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:29.200
What, Russell?
 

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.799
Student: The benzoyl is
minus before,

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:31.960
but hydrogen --
Prof: Ah ha.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.144
But how do you get benzoyl
hydride, plus,

00:21:35.144 --> 00:21:35.542
plus?
 

00:21:35.542 --> 00:21:36.259
Right?
 

00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:37.650
So there's something weird
going on.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.000
So this is a problem.
 

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.297
In the 1840s and 1850s,
the French discovered a

00:21:44.297 --> 00:21:46.872
competing theory --
or invented,

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:49.779
I should say -- a competing
theory called the substitution

00:21:49.779 --> 00:21:51.577
theory,
or the type theory,

00:21:51.577 --> 00:21:55.315
or the unitary theory,
as opposed to the dualistic

00:21:55.315 --> 00:21:57.808
theory,
the plus, minus idea.

00:21:57.808 --> 00:22:00.868
So these began to compete with
one another.

00:22:00.868 --> 00:22:05.288
And it started at a ball in the
Tuileries Palace in 1830.

00:22:05.288 --> 00:22:09.410
This picture is from 40 years
later, or 37 years later.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.230
But what happened is they got
the ball started,

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.058
all the people came dressed up
fancy,

00:22:14.058 --> 00:22:17.598
and they began to cough and
choke because the room was

00:22:17.598 --> 00:22:19.670
filled with some noxious gas.
 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.801
And when they discovered it
came from the candles,

00:22:22.801 --> 00:22:25.038
they asked Dumas to look into
it.

00:22:25.038 --> 00:22:29.417
And he identified the culprit
as HCl, because it turned out

00:22:29.417 --> 00:22:32.058
that the candles were very
white.

00:22:32.058 --> 00:22:35.770
The wax had been bleached with
chlorine, and when they were

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.500
burned HCl was given off.
 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:43.108
So the question is,
what is it that holds chlorine?

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:46.094
How did this fat,
in the candles,

00:22:46.094 --> 00:22:48.519
fix chlorine gas?
 

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:50.559
Well you're in a position to
understand that now.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:54.708
We can think about mechanisms;
in fact, two ways that the

00:22:54.708 --> 00:22:57.818
hydrocarbon could fix chlorine.
 

00:22:57.818 --> 00:23:01.602
Now, suppose we try -- there's
chlorine that is being used to

00:23:01.602 --> 00:23:02.798
bleach the stuff.
 

00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:05.609
Let's try for a HUMO/LUMO
approach.

00:23:05.609 --> 00:23:07.480
What makes chlorine reactive?
 

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.480
High HOMO or low LUMO?
 

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.339
What's unusual about chlorine?
 

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:19.910
Student:  Low LUMO.
 

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.880
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:21.390
Student:  Low LUMO.
 

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.950
Prof: Why do you say so
Claire?

00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:26.528
What is the low LUMO?
 

00:23:26.528 --> 00:23:28.730
Student:  It's the Cl-Cl
bond.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.138
Prof: Right,
the ÃÆ* of Cl-Cl,

00:23:31.138 --> 00:23:34.048
which is low because chlorine
has a high nuclear charge.

00:23:34.048 --> 00:23:38.598
Okay, now we need a HOMO to
react with it.

00:23:38.598 --> 00:23:41.971
Now, one of the more
interesting hydrocarbons,

00:23:41.971 --> 00:23:45.042
in this regard,
is one that had been known

00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:49.088
already, for fourty years,
to react with chlorine.

00:23:49.088 --> 00:23:52.540
And it was because of that
reaction it was called the

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.125
"olefiant gas",
and was by this time known to

00:23:56.125 --> 00:23:56.788
be C_2H_4.
 

00:23:56.788 --> 00:23:57.519
Right?
 

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.759
So we would write it with a
double bond.

00:23:59.759 --> 00:24:01.917
"Olefiant",
because ole,

00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:03.700
oil, and fiant,
to make;

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.634
so it's the stuff that makes
oil.

00:24:05.634 --> 00:24:06.118
Right?
 

00:24:06.118 --> 00:24:08.726
And we'll see the reaction that
makes oil here,

00:24:08.726 --> 00:24:10.368
its reaction with chlorine.
 

00:24:10.368 --> 00:24:16.349
So what makes the olefiant gas
reactive?

00:24:16.349 --> 00:24:17.130
Kevin?
 

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.150
Student:  Poor overlap.
 

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.577
Prof: Right,
so poor overlap makes a high

00:24:21.577 --> 00:24:21.940
HOMO.
 

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.819
And remember the name of it?
 

00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:25.920
Student:  Ãâ¬.
 

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.420
Prof: Ãâ¬.
 

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.294
So the Ãâ¬ electrons
because of poor overlap are a

00:24:29.294 --> 00:24:29.900
high HOMO.
 

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.788
So we can use those electrons
to mix with the low LUMO;

00:24:32.788 --> 00:24:36.750
and again, one of these
make-and-break situations.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:40.397
And chloride leaves and you get
this thing, which has a positive

00:24:40.397 --> 00:24:40.920
charge.
 

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.640
Now that thing itself is
reactive.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.359
What do you make -- where is a
low LUMO in this one?

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:49.670
Pardon me?
 

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.930
Student:  On the
positive charge.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.009
Prof: Speak up please.
 

00:24:52.009 --> 00:24:53.210
Student:  On the
positive charge.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.548
Prof: Where the positive
charge is.

00:24:54.548 --> 00:24:57.446
There's a vacant orbital on
carbon, an atomic orbital of

00:24:57.446 --> 00:24:58.869
carbon that's not shared.
 

00:24:58.869 --> 00:25:00.230
So there's a low LUMO.
 

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.210
Where's a high HOMO?
 

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:02.980
Have you got that too Virginia?
 

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.788
Student:  On Cl.
 

00:25:05.788 --> 00:25:08.698
Prof: Chlorine has
unshared pairs,

00:25:08.698 --> 00:25:09.279
right.
 

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:10.288
Bingo!
 

00:25:10.288 --> 00:25:12.909
So, in fact,
both those things happen at

00:25:12.909 --> 00:25:13.380
once.
 

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.630
It's not that one happens and
then the other.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.078
Both those things happen at
once.

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:19.980
And you can see it by looking
at molecular orbitals.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.183
So there's the HOMO of the
ethylene or olefiant gas,

00:25:24.183 --> 00:25:26.740
and the ÃÆ* LUMO.
 

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:27.818
So those things mix.
 

00:25:27.818 --> 00:25:31.260
The blue orbitals overlap and
mix, shift electrons toward the

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:33.640
other one;
the chloride breaks away.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.374
But at the same time the HOMO
of the chlorine mixes with the

00:25:38.374 --> 00:25:40.220
LUMO of the ethylene.
 

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.750
So you're making two bonds at
once, two pairs of electrons.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.457
So you make that three-membered
ring, with two new bonds,

00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:50.368
and the chloride,
as we said, breaks away.

00:25:50.368 --> 00:25:55.970
Okay, so we've got that
substance now.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.578
And now it itself is reactive.
 

00:25:58.578 --> 00:26:01.770
Can you see what would be
reactive about that cation

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.710
intermediate?
 

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:06.130
What are you probably looking
for, a LUMO or a HOMO?

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:06.710
Student:  A LUMO.
 

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:07.538
Prof: A LUMO.
 

00:26:07.538 --> 00:26:11.420
Angela, do you have an idea of
what could be a LUMO here?

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.608
Student:  The chlorine
has a positive charge.

00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:15.818
Prof: It's true that the
chlorine has a positive charge.

00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:20.454
Does it have a vacant orbital,
an unoccupied molecular

00:26:20.454 --> 00:26:21.329
orbital?
 

00:26:21.329 --> 00:26:21.880
Student:  No it doesn't.
 

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.930
Prof: No,
it turns out it's got two

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:24.778
unshared pairs.
 

00:26:24.778 --> 00:26:27.980
So it doesn't have any -- it's
not like the carbon plus was.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.740
But the plus will make orbitals
low in energy.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.618
So what's a vacant orbital of
this thing?

00:26:32.618 --> 00:26:33.970
All it's got is ÃÆ
bonds.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:42.042
But what makes -- suppose all
you have in your molecule is

00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.414
ÃÆ bonds,
but you want to have an

00:26:44.414 --> 00:26:46.301
unusually low energy vacant
orbital.

00:26:46.301 --> 00:26:46.950
Right?
 

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:48.299
The plus charge will help.
 

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:50.798
But what orbital will you have?
 

00:26:50.798 --> 00:26:51.619
Student: 
ÃÆ*.

00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:52.289
Prof: ÃÆ*.
 

00:26:52.289 --> 00:26:53.338
Now you got two choices.
 

00:26:53.338 --> 00:26:56.308
You got carbon-carbon or
carbon-chlorine.

00:26:56.308 --> 00:26:58.740
Which one's more likely to be
low energy?

00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.859
Student: 
Carbon-chlorine.

00:26:59.859 --> 00:27:00.838
Prof: Why?
 

00:27:00.838 --> 00:27:02.930
Student:  Because the
chlorine --

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.710
Prof: Say it --
Student:  Chlorine has a

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.690
high effective nuclear charge.
 

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.362
Prof: Right,
chlorine has a high nuclear

00:27:07.362 --> 00:27:07.690
charge.
 

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.526
So a ÃÆ*
carbon-chlorine,

00:27:09.526 --> 00:27:11.770
would it be big on carbon or
big on chlorine,

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:12.180
Sam?
 

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:13.548
Student:  Big on carbon.
 

00:27:13.548 --> 00:27:16.037
Prof: Big on carbon,
because the bonding orbital was

00:27:16.037 --> 00:27:16.722
big on chlorine.
 

00:27:16.722 --> 00:27:17.108
Right?
 

00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:18.869
This is the kind of stuff we're
talking about.

00:27:18.869 --> 00:27:20.339
So ÃÆ*.
 

00:27:20.339 --> 00:27:22.150
And there it is.
 

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.119
Okay, there's a localized
ÃÆ*.

00:27:25.119 --> 00:27:29.319
Big on carbon, the black one;
small on chlorine;

00:27:29.319 --> 00:27:30.690
and antibonding between them.
 

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.690
Now what are you going to --
there's the low LUMO.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.868
What do you have for a high
HOMO, to react with it?

00:27:36.868 --> 00:27:44.559
You have to think back to
what's been happening.

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.358
Sherwin?
 

00:27:45.358 --> 00:27:46.368
Student:  The chlorine
one.

00:27:46.368 --> 00:27:48.810
Prof: The chloride that
you had at the beginning,

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.319
that you lost in the first
step.

00:27:50.319 --> 00:27:52.109
Okay, so we bring it over here.
 

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:53.349
So it'll have good overlap.
 

00:27:53.349 --> 00:27:56.190
It comes up, makes a new bond;
that make and break.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.019
And you get that.
 

00:27:57.019 --> 00:28:01.858
And that was the reaction in
1795 that resulted in ethylene

00:28:01.858 --> 00:28:04.528
being called the olefiant gas.
 

00:28:04.528 --> 00:28:07.421
Because this is the oil that
was made, by reacting it with

00:28:07.421 --> 00:28:07.980
chlorine.
 

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.858
So that was already a very old
reaction at this time;

00:28:10.858 --> 00:28:13.387
the "oil of Dutch
chemists",

00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:17.420
because it was four Dutch
chemists who reported that oil.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:21.365
Okay, so there's one way that
you can fix chlorine,

00:28:21.365 --> 00:28:24.599
make it part of a hydrocarbon
molecule.

00:28:24.599 --> 00:28:26.250
It's addition to an alkene.
 

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.902
So if the hydrocarbons are
unsaturated, if they have some

00:28:28.902 --> 00:28:30.606
double-bonds,
then they'll react with

00:28:30.606 --> 00:28:32.170
chlorine to fix the chlorine.
 

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:33.868
So that's one possibility.
 

00:28:33.868 --> 00:28:35.859
But how about if you don't have
a double bond?

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.380
How about if you have methane?
 

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:46.400
What's the problem now,
in doing an analogous reaction?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.029
Sherwin?
 

00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:48.359
Student:  You don't have
the Ãâ¬ in there.

00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.038
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:28:49.038 --> 00:28:49.950
Student:  We don't have
the Ãâ¬ in there.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:50.809
Prof: You don't have a
Ãâ¬.

00:28:50.809 --> 00:28:53.759
You don't have a low LUMO.
 

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:55.730
So you can't do a HOMO/LUMO
reaction.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:56.170
Right?
 

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.961
These are our model,
saturated alkanes,

00:28:58.961 --> 00:29:02.193
like methane,
our model of things that aren't

00:29:02.193 --> 00:29:04.838
unusually high or unusually low.
 

00:29:04.838 --> 00:29:07.180
So you have to have another
trick.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:11.517
And here's the trick;
that the chlorine-chlorine bond

00:29:11.517 --> 00:29:12.118
is weak.
 

00:29:12.118 --> 00:29:15.009
It's only 58 kilocalories per
mole.

00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:19.144
And one of the reasons for that
is that the chlorine has so many

00:29:19.144 --> 00:29:20.259
unshared pairs.
 

00:29:20.259 --> 00:29:22.971
So you mix -- if you were
trying to form a Ãâ¬

00:29:22.971 --> 00:29:25.479
orbital in chlorine,
you have two electrons in the

00:29:25.479 --> 00:29:27.819
p orbital here,
two electrons in the p

00:29:27.819 --> 00:29:28.420
orbital here.
 

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:29.250
They overlap.
 

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:34.730
Is that going to be bonding,
if you mix these two orbitals?

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.640
You'll obviously mix them.
 

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.806
When you mix two orbitals you
get a lower one and a higher

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:39.140
one.
 

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:41.848
Will it be bonding?
 

00:29:41.848 --> 00:29:46.119
This one will be bonding but
this one is anti-bonding.

00:29:46.119 --> 00:29:48.150
Everybody with me on this?
 

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:50.200
Now, so Kate,
what would you say?

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.950
Is it going to be net favorable
or unfavorable?

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:59.442
Two electrons went down in
energy, two electrons went up in

00:29:59.442 --> 00:30:00.140
energy.
 

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.602
But the ones that went up,
went up a little more than the

00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:03.349
down went down.
 

00:30:03.349 --> 00:30:04.740
So that's unfavorable.
 

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.539
So having so many unshared
pairs weakens the single bond.

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:11.720
So chlorine has a weak bond.
 

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:15.487
Now still it's worth 58
kilocalories per mole,

00:30:15.487 --> 00:30:17.579
which is plenty strong.
 

00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.690
It doesn't just break.
 

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.980
You got to do something to help
it to break.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:25.666
And what you can do is -- I've
made it in this weird color,

00:30:25.666 --> 00:30:27.130
which is hard to see.
 

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.910
Why?
 

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.028
Anybody know?
 

00:30:32.028 --> 00:30:32.980
Student:  The color of
chlorine.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.608
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:30:33.608 --> 00:30:34.509
Student:  It's the color
of chlorine.

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:36.529
Prof: That's the color
of chlorine.

00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:38.868
It absorbs visible light.
 

00:30:38.868 --> 00:30:42.950
Now how does it take on energy,
when it absorbs visible light?

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.089
Where does the energy go,
in the molecule?

00:30:45.089 --> 00:30:47.420
Does anybody know?
 

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:48.430
Dana?
 

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.970
Student: Electrons are
promoted.

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:49.630
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:51.058
Student:  Electrons get
promoted to higher --

00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:54.598
Prof: Electrons go from
orbitals to higher orbitals.

00:30:54.598 --> 00:30:56.992
So you can put -- and the next
higher orbital is

00:30:56.992 --> 00:30:57.910
ÃÆ*.
 

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.903
And what happens if you take an
electron and put it in

00:31:00.903 --> 00:31:01.920
ÃÆ*?
 

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:09.640
It breaks the bond. Right?
 

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.263
That's what happened up at the
top, when the chlorine broke,

00:31:12.263 --> 00:31:12.618
right?
 

00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:15.848
You put electrons into
ÃÆ*.

00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:18.596
So you can do it with light,
as well as with some HOMO

00:31:18.596 --> 00:31:19.220
attacking.
 

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:24.238
Okay, so we have -- in fact,
I said LUMO when I was talking

00:31:24.238 --> 00:31:27.442
about ethylene;
I meant HOMO up above,

00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:30.670
I think, some three or four
minutes ago.

00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.359
Okay, so the bond breaks.
 

00:31:32.359 --> 00:31:35.108
But it doesn't break into ions.
 

00:31:35.108 --> 00:31:39.539
It breaks one electron going
each way, because that's easier.

00:31:39.539 --> 00:31:40.078
Okay?
 

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:45.180
And notice that we draw curved
arrows for that too,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.326
but you draw arrows with a
single barb rather than a double

00:31:48.326 --> 00:31:50.233
barb,
when it's just one electron

00:31:50.233 --> 00:31:53.403
rather than a pair of electrons
that's executing the motion

00:31:53.403 --> 00:31:54.660
we're talking about.
 

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.578
Okay, so now we have two
chlorine atoms.

00:31:57.578 --> 00:32:01.273
And now we can do the trick
with the chlorine atom,

00:32:01.273 --> 00:32:05.190
because we have this SOMO,
and it can mix with the C-H

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:09.173
bond to make a new bond;
that is, one electron in the

00:32:09.173 --> 00:32:11.088
C-H bond now goes each way.
 

00:32:11.088 --> 00:32:14.115
One goes to complete the pair,
to make HCl,

00:32:14.115 --> 00:32:16.638
and the other one is left on
carbon.

00:32:16.638 --> 00:32:17.358
Right?
 

00:32:17.358 --> 00:32:19.884
So it's very much like the
reaction above,

00:32:19.884 --> 00:32:23.640
but it's single electrons that
are doing the moving instead of

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.808
electron pairs.
 

00:32:24.808 --> 00:32:28.769
And the nice thing about this
is you still have a radical.

00:32:28.769 --> 00:32:29.818
It must be so.
 

00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:33.160
If you start with something
with an odd number of electrons,

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.246
and react it with something
with an even number of

00:32:35.246 --> 00:32:36.652
electrons,
you must be left,

00:32:36.652 --> 00:32:38.807
at the end, with an odd number
of electrons.

00:32:38.807 --> 00:32:39.259
Right?
 

00:32:39.259 --> 00:32:43.054
So CH_3 is such a radical,
and it can react with

00:32:43.054 --> 00:32:47.493
something, to break another
bond, and it reacts with the

00:32:47.493 --> 00:32:49.270
weakest bond,
chlorine.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:50.240
Right?
 

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:54.613
So now you have methyl chloride
-- you've incorporated chlorine

00:32:54.613 --> 00:32:58.140
into the alkane -- and you have
a chlorine atom.

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.799
Why is it neat,
that you have a chlorine atom?

00:33:01.799 --> 00:33:04.269
What's great about that?
 

00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:04.940
Student:
&gt;

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.440
Prof: Dana,
what did you say?

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.220
Student:  That was what
you started with.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:09.390
Prof: That's what you
needed at the beginning.

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:11.740
That's why you used light,
in order to get that.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:14.198
But you don't need any more
light now.

00:33:14.198 --> 00:33:14.730
Right?
 

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:16.720
That can go back and start over
again.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.210
So it's a "chain"
reaction.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:22.328
It's called a free-radical
chain reaction.

00:33:22.328 --> 00:33:25.779
And so you can get lots of
products from just one initial

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:28.798
photon of light,
that started this chain along.

00:33:28.798 --> 00:33:30.890
So these are two completely
different ways.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.053
The first, the top is an
"addition"

00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:35.778
of chlorine to an alkene,
and the bottom is called

00:33:35.778 --> 00:33:37.799
free-radical
"substitution"

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:40.596
of chlorine for hydrogen,
and involves SOMOs,

00:33:40.596 --> 00:33:42.380
rather than HOMOs and LUMOs.
 

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.279
Chris?
 

00:33:43.279 --> 00:33:47.077
Student:  If you have a
second chlorine radical from the

00:33:47.077 --> 00:33:49.318
first breakingÃ¢â¬Â¦
Prof: Yeah.

00:33:49.318 --> 00:33:52.858
Student:  Ã¢â¬Â¦why
does it break a second chlorine

00:33:52.858 --> 00:33:55.440
molecule, rather than using the
other --

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.792
Prof: Because they have
to find one another.

00:33:58.792 --> 00:33:59.328
Right?
 

00:33:59.328 --> 00:34:02.602
They've gone off -- it'll take
forever before they by chance

00:34:02.602 --> 00:34:04.598
encounter one another in
solution.

00:34:04.598 --> 00:34:06.528
They'll react with many
molecules.

00:34:06.528 --> 00:34:09.550
If you try to generate too many
chlorine radicals,

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.735
so the concentration gets high,
then their concentration will

00:34:12.735 --> 00:34:14.577
drop again,
or not get so high,

00:34:14.577 --> 00:34:17.059
because they find one another
and combine.

00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:21.139
But as long as they're rare,
they can survive.

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:25.550
You know what the license plate
of New Hampshire says on it?

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:30.039
"Live free or die."
 

00:34:30.039 --> 00:34:32.780
Okay?
 

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:36.320
I use that joke later on.
 

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.762
Okay, 1830s to 1850s,
we have this substitution or

00:34:39.762 --> 00:34:41.518
type or unitary theory.
 

00:34:41.518 --> 00:34:44.260
It doesn't involve the
plus/minus stuff.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.039
Max?
 

00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:46.429
Student:  Is that kind
of like how CFCs work?

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:47.570
Prof: Is it kind of like
what?

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.449
Student:  How CFCs
destroy the ozone.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.579
Prof: I couldn't hear
clearly.

00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:52.750
Student:  Is that how
CFCs break down the ozone?

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.668
Prof: Yeah,
they involve -- that's a

00:34:54.668 --> 00:34:57.000
free-radical chain reaction,
the ozone reduction.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.670
Yeah.
 

00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:00.610
We'll talk about that a little
bit later, I hope.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:05.056
Okay, so there's more trouble
for radicals,

00:35:05.056 --> 00:35:07.280
from Dumas in 1839.
 

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.918
And that is that they had this
-- remember, acetyl radical had

00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:12.590
been discovered by Liebig.
 

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:17.228
So there was this great element
that would survive from reaction

00:35:17.228 --> 00:35:18.260
to reaction.
 

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.889
But here was a reaction with
chlorine,

00:35:20.889 --> 00:35:23.719
of this kind that Dumas had
been studying,

00:35:23.719 --> 00:35:26.960
where you start with acetic
acid, acetyl OH,

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.179
react it with chlorine,
and you get a chloroacetyl.

00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:33.769
So the element has been changed.
 

00:35:33.769 --> 00:35:35.059
It's been transmuted.
 

00:35:35.059 --> 00:35:38.146
It doesn't go unchanged from
reaction to reaction.

00:35:38.146 --> 00:35:38.650
Right?
 

00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.460
And, in fact,
it goes even further.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:44.469
It can react again to give
dichloroacetyl or

00:35:44.469 --> 00:35:46.150
trichloroacetyl.
 

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:49.393
All the hydrogens can be
substituted, as we now know by

00:35:49.393 --> 00:35:51.858
the kind of mechanism,
the SOMO mechanism,

00:35:51.858 --> 00:35:56.061
we just studied;
free-radical chlorination,

00:35:56.061 --> 00:35:57.909
chain reaction.
 

00:35:57.909 --> 00:36:02.422
So hydrogen can be substituted
by an equivalent amount of

00:36:02.422 --> 00:36:04.679
halogen, or oxygen,
right?

00:36:04.679 --> 00:36:08.956
But all these things you get,
when you change a radical into

00:36:08.956 --> 00:36:11.639
something else,
when you transmute it,

00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:13.670
have similar properties.
 

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.195
All of these acids -- acetic
acid, chloroacetic,

00:36:17.195 --> 00:36:19.518
dichloroacetic,
trichloroacetic,

00:36:19.518 --> 00:36:22.795
are all acids;
they all taste sharp and so on.

00:36:22.795 --> 00:36:23.230
Right?
 

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.800
So they're similar.
 

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:28.469
So they don't change the type.
 

00:36:28.469 --> 00:36:31.090
That's where this idea of Type
theory came on.

00:36:31.090 --> 00:36:33.942
You get the same type of
molecule, even after you have a

00:36:33.942 --> 00:36:34.719
substitution.
 

00:36:34.719 --> 00:36:39.400
So by 1853, four types were
recognized as prevalent.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.206
One was water,
another was hydrogen,

00:36:42.206 --> 00:36:46.780
another was hydrochloric acid,
and another was ammonia.

00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.505
So, for example,
you could have these

00:36:48.505 --> 00:36:50.853
structures;
and this drawing with a curly

00:36:50.853 --> 00:36:54.179
bracket like this was the
notation used by the people who

00:36:54.179 --> 00:36:55.309
did Type theory.
 

00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:58.061
So you have water,
hydrochloric acid,

00:36:58.061 --> 00:36:59.820
hydrogen and ammonia.
 

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.076
And you could exchange,
make exchanges,

00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.085
for the hydrogen.
 

00:37:03.085 --> 00:37:03.619
Right?
 

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:04.550
Substitution.
 

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:08.802
So, for example with ammonia,
you can substitute ethyl for

00:37:08.802 --> 00:37:12.682
hydrogen and you could get
ethylamine, diethylmanine,

00:37:12.682 --> 00:37:14.250
or triethylamine.
 

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:16.010
But these were all basic.
 

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:20.179
Why would we say they're basic,
in the sense of acid base?

00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:22.960
Why do we say they're basic?
 

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.820
They react with acids, why?
 

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:25.809
Sherwin?
 

00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:27.010
Student:  The unshared
pair.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.568
Prof: Yeah,
they all have the unshared pair

00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:29.460
on nitrogen, we would say.
 

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.230
But they said they're just the
same Type of molecule.

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:34.039
Okay?
 

00:37:34.039 --> 00:37:37.590
Or you could have ethyl
alcohol, which is of the water

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:38.059
type.
 

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:43.440
Or the potassium salt thereof,
which they would say is the

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:46.650
potassium-ethyl analog of water.
 

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.880
Or of the HCl,
you could have ethyl iodide,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.956
where you exchanged hydrogen
with ethyl, and exchanged

00:37:53.956 --> 00:37:55.880
chloride with iodine.
 

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.380
Okay, but in fact these two
things could react with one

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:02.987
another to give this ether;
which is another thing that's

00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:05.489
still like water,
clear liquid and so on.

00:38:05.489 --> 00:38:06.110
Okay?
 

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.630
Fairly unreactive.
 

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:13.739
So this particular reaction was
named for the work,

00:38:13.739 --> 00:38:18.139
in 1850, of Williamson in
England.

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:20.829
So it's called the Williamson
Ether Synthesis.

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:24.659
And we'll talk about that again
later.

00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:26.159
But it's quite an old reaction.
 

00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:30.099
So how about the theory of
these types?

00:38:30.099 --> 00:38:32.800
So notice it's unitary,
not dualistic.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.719
They're just things that are
holistic, right?

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.349
Not plus/minus.
 

00:38:37.349 --> 00:38:40.780
Dumas said that molecules are
like planetary systems,

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.659
like the sun and its planets,
"held together by a force

00:38:44.659 --> 00:38:48.280
resembling gravitation,
but acting in accord with much

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.130
more complicated laws."
 

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:54.141
He didn't think it was gravity,
but it was some force holds

00:38:54.141 --> 00:38:56.010
this assemblage together.
 

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:59.306
And Williamson,
Alexander William Williamson,

00:38:59.306 --> 00:39:03.579
who we just mentioned making
ether, said this is something

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:04.179
new.
 

00:39:04.179 --> 00:39:08.335
And notice it's because it's a
very young guy that has a new

00:39:08.335 --> 00:39:11.505
idea, not like these
imagination-starved older

00:39:11.505 --> 00:39:12.280
people.
 

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.670
At this time Dumas was
40-years-old.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.010
He's 4/7ths as old as I am,
right?

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:22.579
So he was really getting over
the hill.

00:39:22.579 --> 00:39:25.532
"A formula"
-- the young guy says --

00:39:25.532 --> 00:39:29.275
"may be used as an actual
image of what we rationally

00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:33.280
suppose to be the arrangement of
constituent atoms."

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.219
This is entirely new.
 

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:38.311
Formulas, at least since
Dalton, were only what the

00:39:38.311 --> 00:39:40.969
elements were and what ratios
they're in;

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:43.630
not how they're arranged. Right?
 

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.239
But he said,
"We can think that they're

00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:51.615
like an orrery,
which is an image of what we

00:39:51.615 --> 00:39:54.820
conclude to be the arrangement
of our planetary system."

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.059
Do you know what an orrery is?
 

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:59.400
It's a thing like this,
you know, where you have a

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.268
mechanical model of the solar
system and you turn a crank and

00:40:02.268 --> 00:40:05.561
the moon goes around the earth,
the earth goes around the sun,

00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:08.130
and a bunch of moons go around
Saturn and so on.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:09.880
Have you seen these devices?
 

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.969
Okay, that was very popular.
 

00:40:10.969 --> 00:40:16.163
There was a show of Joseph
Wright of Derby here at Yale

00:40:16.163 --> 00:40:17.510
last summer.
 

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:20.010
So butyl bromide,
you remember,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:23.510
is a residue of radical
dualism, right?;

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:25.750
plus-butyl, minus-bromide.
 

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.909
But there's another name for
butyl bromide.

00:40:27.909 --> 00:40:31.340
Do you know what it is?
 

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.340
You know the other name for
butyl bromide?

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.344
We haven't talked about
systematic nomenclature yet,

00:40:36.344 --> 00:40:37.760
so you probably don't.
 

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.469
But it's also called
bromobutane.

00:40:40.469 --> 00:40:44.177
But bromobutane is not two
words, it's one word.

00:40:44.177 --> 00:40:44.809
Right?
 

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:47.858
And that's a relic of the
unitary theory,

00:40:47.858 --> 00:40:51.746
the substitution theory,
that it's butane in which a

00:40:51.746 --> 00:40:54.949
hydrogen has been replaced by
bromine.

00:40:54.949 --> 00:40:59.706
Okay, so Berzelius,
in 1838 when these things came

00:40:59.706 --> 00:41:01.887
along,
said: "By reacting

00:41:01.887 --> 00:41:05.016
chlorine with ordinary ether
produced a very interesting

00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:08.097
compound which he reckoned,
according to the theory of

00:41:08.097 --> 00:41:10.916
substitutions,
to be an ether in which 4 atoms

00:41:10.916 --> 00:41:13.896
of chlorine replaced 4 atoms of
hydrogen."

00:41:13.896 --> 00:41:14.480
Right?
 

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:18.068
So Dumas says that in these
types you can replace hydrogen

00:41:18.068 --> 00:41:18.949
by chlorine.
 

00:41:18.949 --> 00:41:20.679
What would Berzelius think
about that?

00:41:20.679 --> 00:41:25.190
What kind of theory is he
advocating?

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:29.889
Remember, we talked last time
about Berzelius.

00:41:29.889 --> 00:41:32.800
He was the originator of
dualism, plus/minus.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:38.750
What would he think of
replacing hydrogen by chlorine?

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:39.829
Lucas?
 

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:41.880
Student:  It's
impossible.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:42.690
If chlorine is minus,
hydrogen is plus.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:43.737
Prof: Right.
 

00:41:43.737 --> 00:41:46.606
So here's what he said:
"An element as eminently

00:41:46.606 --> 00:41:49.639
electronegative as chlorine
would never be able to enter

00:41:49.639 --> 00:41:51.239
into an organic radical.
 

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:55.273
This idea is contrary to the
first principles of

00:41:55.273 --> 00:41:56.820
chemistry."
 

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:57.449
Okay?
 

00:41:57.449 --> 00:42:00.659
And in that same paper,
in 1838, he talked about

00:42:00.659 --> 00:42:04.961
tartrate losing an atom of water
-- but you mean it's a molecule

00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:06.260
-- at 190Â°.
 

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.768
But the interesting thing about
that,

00:42:07.768 --> 00:42:11.867
it's not transformation,
but that this is the first time

00:42:11.867 --> 00:42:16.518
the letter R was used,
to talk about a generic radical;

00:42:16.518 --> 00:42:18.295
"R"
stands for radical.

00:42:18.295 --> 00:42:18.739
Right?
 

00:42:18.739 --> 00:42:19.880
So we still use that.
 

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:24.664
So, so much of what we do
nowadays derives from this

00:42:24.664 --> 00:42:25.510
period.
 

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.159
Okay?
 

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:31.320
So the principal journal at
that time,

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.045
in chemistry,
was the Annalen der Chemie

00:42:34.045 --> 00:42:36.804
und Pharmacie,
which was originally the

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:41.389
Annalen der Pharmacie;
but Chemie was added.

00:42:41.389 --> 00:42:43.610
And you see who put it out.
 

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:47.077
It says: "With the
collaboration of Dumas in Paris

00:42:47.077 --> 00:42:48.940
and Graham in London."
 

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.780
And Graham is one of the guys
out in front of the building

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.130
here.
 

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.030
Edited by WÃ¶hler and
Liebig;

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:58.179
but actually it was Liebig,
he was the one.

00:42:58.179 --> 00:43:02.518
And later the journal came to
be called Liebig's

00:43:02.518 --> 00:43:03.559
Annalen.
 

00:43:03.559 --> 00:43:04.340
Right?
 

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.429
So he was the one in charge,
but he'd added these other

00:43:07.429 --> 00:43:09.260
people, just sort of for show.
 

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.900
Okay, so in 1840,
there were a series of papers

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.849
published.
 

00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:16.693
The first of them was by his
so-called collaborator,

00:43:16.693 --> 00:43:19.648
Dumas, On the Law of
Substitution and the Theory of

00:43:19.648 --> 00:43:20.429
Types.
 

00:43:20.429 --> 00:43:22.380
This was a 40-page paper.
 

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.088
And it begins with this
question, number one there:

00:43:25.088 --> 00:43:28.340
"Can one substitute the
elements that play their role in

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.079
any simple or compound substance
equivalent for equivalent?"

00:43:32.079 --> 00:43:35.389
So can you make a new atom take
the role of an old atom?

00:43:35.389 --> 00:43:39.771
And you won't be surprised that
in 40 pages he concludes the

00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:40.960
answer is yes.
 

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.315
But immediately following this
is a note from the editor,

00:43:44.315 --> 00:43:48.030
which says "Remarks on
the Previous Paper."

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.210
And it's by J.L.
 

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:51.070
at the bottom, Justus Liebig.
 

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.697
And he says,
begins: "I am a far cry

00:43:53.697 --> 00:43:57.572
from sharing the ideas that
Monsieur Dumas has linked to the

00:43:57.572 --> 00:44:00.989
so-called laws of the
substitution theory."

00:44:00.989 --> 00:44:04.114
And then there's another paper,
by another Frenchman,

00:44:04.114 --> 00:44:07.237
Pelouze, on "The
Substitution Law of Monsieur

00:44:07.237 --> 00:44:08.440
Dumas."
 

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:11.289
And after that lengthy paper,
there's a letter,

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:14.614
"On the Law of
Substitution and the Theory of

00:44:14.614 --> 00:44:17.425
Types,"
with a footnote that says it

00:44:17.425 --> 00:44:19.599
was a letter to Justus Liebig.
 

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:21.690
And you notice it's dated Paris.
 

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.668
And it's the only paper that's
in French, in his particular

00:44:24.668 --> 00:44:25.079
issue.
 

00:44:25.079 --> 00:44:28.460
And there's another page.
 

00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.677
It's got some curious formulas
in them that have a lot of

00:44:31.677 --> 00:44:32.309
chlorine.
 

00:44:32.309 --> 00:44:35.460
We'll come back to that in just
a second.

00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:40.150
And it's by a chemist that no
one had heard of before called

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.650
S.C.H. Windler -- this letter
to Liebig.

00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:46.277
And then the next paper is also
"On the Reaction of

00:44:46.277 --> 00:44:48.768
Chlorine with the Chlorides of
Ethanol and Methanol,

00:44:48.768 --> 00:44:51.329
and Several Points of the Ether
Theory,"

00:44:51.329 --> 00:44:55.199
by Regnault,
who was a French chemist.

00:44:55.199 --> 00:44:58.070
Now this is that letter,
translated.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:00.958
"Paris,
1 March, 1840.

00:45:00.958 --> 00:45:02.179
Monsieur!
 

00:45:02.179 --> 00:45:05.447
I am eager to communicate to
you one of the most striking

00:45:05.447 --> 00:45:07.139
facts of organic chemistry.
 

00:45:07.139 --> 00:45:10.320
I have confirmed the
substitution theory in an

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.280
extremely remarkable and
completely unexpected manner.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.615
Only now can one appreciate the
great value of this theory and

00:45:18.615 --> 00:45:22.170
foresee the immense discoveries
that it promises to

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.380
reveal."
 

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.827
So it starts -- it's got a
complicated description of all

00:45:26.827 --> 00:45:28.945
the --
light that was used sometimes

00:45:28.945 --> 00:45:31.920
and the various distillations
and crystallizations,

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.309
and the crystals are described.
 

00:45:36.309 --> 00:45:38.059
But he started with manganese
acetate,

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:42.030
which had this formula with the
acetyl radical in it,

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.529
and was able to chlorinate --
to substitute the hydrogens with

00:45:45.529 --> 00:45:46.159
chlorine.
 

00:45:46.159 --> 00:45:50.639
So there's already a validation
of the substitution theory.

00:45:50.639 --> 00:45:51.829
But it went further.
 

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:57.014
A subsequent reaction exchanged
the O in manganese oxide with

00:45:57.014 --> 00:46:02.284
chlorine, and a further reaction
replaced the manganese itself

00:46:02.284 --> 00:46:03.840
with chlorine.
 

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.346
And then the final reaction,
the piÃ¨ce de

00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:07.407
rÃ©sistance,
replaced the carbon with

00:46:07.407 --> 00:46:09.719
chlorine and the oxygen with
chlorine,

00:46:09.719 --> 00:46:12.931
but still it preserved its
type.

00:46:12.931 --> 00:46:13.760
Right?
 

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.460
So it was the same kind of
substance still,

00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.039
even though it was entirely
chlorine.

00:46:17.039 --> 00:46:19.177
"For all I know,
in the decolorizing"

00:46:19.177 --> 00:46:21.409
(that is bleaching)
"action of chlorine,

00:46:21.409 --> 00:46:24.119
hydrogen is replaced by
chlorine, and the cloth,

00:46:24.119 --> 00:46:26.199
which is now being bleached in
England,

00:46:26.199 --> 00:46:29.860
preserves its type according to
the substitution laws.

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.588
I believe, however,
that atom-for-atom substitution

00:46:32.588 --> 00:46:34.989
of carbon by chlorine is my own
discovery.

00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:37.777
I hope you will take note of
this in your journal and be

00:46:37.777 --> 00:46:40.110
assured of my sincerest regards,
etc.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.710
S.C.H.***Windler."
 

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.547
And there's a footnote,
which says: "I have

00:46:44.547 --> 00:46:48.110
learned that there is already in
the London shops a cloth of

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:51.126
chlorine thread,
which is very much sought after

00:46:51.126 --> 00:46:53.661
and preferred above all others
for night caps,

00:46:53.661 --> 00:46:55.409
underwear, etc."
 

00:46:55.409 --> 00:46:59.108
Now this is,
you'll not be surprised a pun,

00:46:59.108 --> 00:47:04.039
because the name is pronounced
schvindler or swindler.

00:47:04.039 --> 00:47:08.409
So where do you think this came
from?

00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:13.510
Liebig didn't have enough sense
of humor to do such a thing.

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.010
Who was the joker?
 

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:16.030
Student:  WÃ¶hler.
 

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.880
Prof: WÃ¶hler.
 

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.646
So WÃ¶hler had sent this in
a letter to Berzelius,

00:47:19.646 --> 00:47:22.675
and Berzelius thought it was so
fun that he forwarded it to

00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:23.250
Liebig.
 

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.585
And to WÃ¶hler's
consternation,

00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:26.960
Liebig published it.
 

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.579
Right?
 

00:47:27.579 --> 00:47:28.159
&gt;
 

00:47:28.159 --> 00:47:30.503
Which didn't make Dumas any
happier.

00:47:30.503 --> 00:47:31.039
Right?
 

00:47:31.039 --> 00:47:35.061
So this was a -- Liebig at
least thought it was funny,

00:47:35.061 --> 00:47:35.820
I guess.
 

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:40.572
Okay, so in 1849 Kolbe prepared
the free methyl radical,

00:47:40.572 --> 00:47:44.719
the actual element,
which had never been prepared

00:47:44.719 --> 00:47:46.190
before, CH_3.
 

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:48.570
He did it by electrolysis.
 

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:53.467
So when you electrolyze acetic
acid it turns out you can get

00:47:53.467 --> 00:47:57.951
hydrogen, hydrogen gas,
and CO_2, and what analyzed for

00:47:57.951 --> 00:47:58.365
CH_3.
 

00:47:58.365 --> 00:47:59.280
Right?
 

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:02.050
So he had prepared the actual
radical.

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:06.079
Now, of course,
it was discovered ten years

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:09.630
later that he hadn't prepared
CH_3.

00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:13.820
It had that analysis,
but actually it was C_2H_6;

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.409
it was the dimer of CH_3.
 

00:48:16.409 --> 00:48:18.780
Okay, but at the time it was
thought to be justification of

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.639
the radical theory.
 

00:48:19.639 --> 00:48:23.489
So these two theories were
competing with one another.

00:48:23.489 --> 00:48:26.898
And ironically,
both the theories were

00:48:26.898 --> 00:48:31.871
supported by reactions that
actually did involve

00:48:31.871 --> 00:48:33.070
radicals.
 

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:35.570
So the oxygenation of
benzaldehyde,

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:38.585
the first reaction that
generated benzoyl,

00:48:38.585 --> 00:48:40.940
did in fact involve benzoyl.
 

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.280
It was a SOMO reaction in which
a hydrogen atom was abstracted.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.976
And the chlorination,
as we've already seen,

00:48:47.976 --> 00:48:51.554
of a hydrocarbon like methane,
involves pulling a hydrogen

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:52.369
atom off.
 

00:48:52.369 --> 00:48:55.894
And that electrolysis did
indeed generate the methyl

00:48:55.894 --> 00:48:59.904
radicals, but they were so
reactive, they found one another

00:48:59.904 --> 00:49:01.840
and dimerized to C_2H_6.
 

00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.541
So it's just sort of curious
that all these reactions did

00:49:05.541 --> 00:49:09.376
indeed involve free radicals,
but no one was truly aware of

00:49:09.376 --> 00:49:09.840
it.
 

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.840
So next time we'll see what
resolved all this.

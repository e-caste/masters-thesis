00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.001
Professor John Rogers:
In Book Five of Paradise

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:07.921
Lost, Milton's theory of
monism -- that's the theory of

00:00:07.921 --> 00:00:10.741
the "one first matter" that we
looked at last time -- the

00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:13.397
theory of monism,
or vitalism or animist

00:00:13.397 --> 00:00:16.597
materialism, there are a number
of terms for it,

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:19.468
arises in the context,
you'll remember,

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:21.880
of a discussion about
digestion.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.325
I'll just remind you:
Adam simply asked Raphael how

00:00:27.325 --> 00:00:31.900
it was that angels could eat
human food,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.056
and Raphael responded with his
radical claim for a continuum of

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:41.830
matter and spirit in God's
universe.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.924
The process of digestion was no
more suggestive or important to

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:51.443
the Archangel Raphael than,
of course, it was for Milton

00:00:51.443 --> 00:00:54.849
himself.
You'll remember that letter to

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:57.995
the famous Dr.
Leonard Philaras in which

00:00:57.995 --> 00:01:02.593
Milton had explained that it was
his bad digestion that he

00:01:02.593 --> 00:01:07.109
believed was largely responsible
for his blindness.

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.560
Milton's digestive theory of
blindness was actually a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.343
perfectly reasonable medical
hypothesis in the seventeenth

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:17.244
century.
Theorists of digestion were

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:21.298
continually arguing that
unescaped gases could easily

00:01:21.298 --> 00:01:25.663
rise up in the body.But
Milton's own adoption of this

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:30.599
theory served a particular and,
I think, an important purpose.

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:34.349
Nearly every -- actually this
is a point that's made most

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:38.300
brilliantly in a book that I
think Matthew Valdiviez has.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.320
It's by Michael Lieb.
Please hold up the book because

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.539
it's a great book.
It's called The Dialetics of

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.023
Creation.
Thank you for reminding me

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:50.192
that I'm indebted to Lieb for
this point: nearly every

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:53.839
important event in Paradise
Lost is represented in some

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:56.590
way or another as a process of
digestion.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.879
Raphael tells Adam -- the
archangel says,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.375
"Knowledge is as food."
Adam must therefore ingest

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:09.424
knowledge temperately just as
it's his obligation to ingest

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.918
food temperately and,
of course, in

00:02:11.918 --> 00:02:15.442
moderation.But it's not just
knowledge: everything is

00:02:15.442 --> 00:02:19.284
digestive in Paradise Lost.
The process that we looked

00:02:19.284 --> 00:02:21.812
at last time,
the transformation of Adam and

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:23.983
Eve into angels,
was going to be,

00:02:23.983 --> 00:02:26.683
as you remember,
the product of a virtuous

00:02:26.683 --> 00:02:28.443
digestion;
but so, too,

00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:33.111
will the expulsion of the rebel
angels be, their expulsion from

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:37.478
heaven when the Son of God
drives them out with his chariot

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:41.085
of paternal deity.
They are essentially eliminated

00:02:41.085 --> 00:02:44.343
as waste.
They're purged from the space

00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:47.751
of heaven.
Milton fills his account of

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:52.910
that expulsion with really all
of the scatology that he can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.683
muster,
and even the Last Judgment will

00:02:55.683 --> 00:02:58.660
be described in terms of a
process of digestion.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.745
The saved will be assimilated
into the body of God,

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:07.449
into the body of the universe,
and the damned at the end of

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:11.256
time will be excreted into
hell.I think Milton's

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:15.361
transforming a lot of these
absolutely central events in

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:19.988
Christian history into something
like scenes of digestion for a

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.305
very good reason.
By turning these moments into

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:29.007
little or big digestive
episodes, Milton's able on some

00:03:29.007 --> 00:03:33.362
level -- although this might
sound irrational -- to

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:38.840
rationalize Christian history.
The process of digestion was of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.840
extraordinary interest in the
seventeenth century,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.090
and scientists were fascinated
in it because digestion,

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.099
like a lot of other processes
in the human body,

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.852
seems to work without our own
conscious knowledge and

00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:55.449
certainly without our own
control.

00:03:55.449 --> 00:04:00.801
Digestion is a self-enclosed
system that seems to obey its

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:06.435
own natural laws rather than
responding to an exercise of our

00:04:06.435 --> 00:04:08.782
will.
Milton imagines so much of

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:11.729
Christian history as scenes of
digestion in a way,

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:15.676
I think, because he needs to
imagine them as occurring

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:19.399
without the deliberate
manipulation of the heavenly

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.420
Father or in some way beyond the
Father's control.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.912
I think Milton is continually
fending off the Calvinist image

00:04:28.912 --> 00:04:32.300
of an arbitrary and punitive
deity.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.713
So the fall of the rebel
angels, the Fall of man,

00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:39.483
the Last Judgment -- all of
these events are perfectly

00:04:39.483 --> 00:04:41.474
reasonable,
natural and,

00:04:41.474 --> 00:04:45.401
at least from one important
perspective in the poem,

00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:49.443
reasonable,
natural, and also organic

00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:56.557
consequences of freely willed,
self-determined human behavior

00:04:56.557 --> 00:05:00.985
or creaturely behavior.
This is important for Milton:

00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:03.351
they're not examples of God's
skittish and arbitrary

00:05:03.351 --> 00:05:06.841
punishment of his creatures,
and that distinction is arising

00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:10.481
everywhere in Paradise
Lost.Now Book Seven is

00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:14.177
the book of creation.
Here more than anywhere we

00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:17.500
would expect,
I think, a representation of

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.796
the extraordinary degree of
power and control that the

00:05:21.796 --> 00:05:25.120
heavenly Father is able to
exercise.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.366
What is the Creation,
after all, if not an arbitrary

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:32.529
display of the Father's
omnipotence?

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:37.190
Milton knows that that's the
case, but at the same time that

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.507
he celebrates that,
he's also struggling to

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:45.183
represent it otherwise;
and so he charges even the

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:50.758
Creation itself with this same
cluster of images involving

00:05:50.758 --> 00:05:55.625
digestion.
Look for example -- this is the

00:05:55.625 --> 00:06:00.149
top of page 352,
Book Seven, line 234.

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:03.296
I think this is one of the most
-- it's puzzling,

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:07.230
and for a lot of readers it's
one of the most physiologically

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.966
suggestive of all of the natural
processes that seem to be

00:06:10.966 --> 00:06:14.518
described in Milton's poem.
The Holy Spirit -- and the Holy

00:06:14.518 --> 00:06:16.490
Spirit is an interesting entity
for Milton.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.008
It seems to be something like
Milton's name for a principle of

00:06:21.008 --> 00:06:25.602
energy behind a lot of natural
processes, a divinely sanctioned

00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:30.357
principle of energy.
The Holy Spirit inseminates

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:32.000
chaos.
This is Milton: 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.642
[O]n the watr'y calm
His brooding wings the Spirit

00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:39.519
of God outspread,
And vital vertue infus'd,

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:42.971
and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid

00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:46.299
Mass...
Raphael describes the Holy

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:50.805
Spirit's stunningly -- and we're
getting used to this --

00:06:50.805 --> 00:06:55.720
stunningly ambisexual behavior
in brooding over and then,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.850
of course, inseminating the
fluid mass of the abyss.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.704
This is the process,
you'll remember,

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:06.699
that actually supplies chaos
with that vital power of motion,

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:11.157
the vital power of warmth and
virtue that's so consequential

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:15.086
for Milton's theory of
monism.These are all ideas

00:07:15.086 --> 00:07:19.165
that Milton discusses in a
theoretical frame in chapter

00:07:19.165 --> 00:07:22.490
seven of Of Christian
Doctrine.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.961
There are seven days of
creation, and Milton has a kind

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.849
of numerological bent,
and so it will be on Book Seven

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.370
of Paradise Lost in which
the Creation is discussed and

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.661
chapter seven of Of Christian
Doctrine in which the

00:07:34.661 --> 00:07:38.280
Creation is discussed.
It's this step -- this

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.494
inseminating step,
in which all of creation is

00:07:42.494 --> 00:07:48.394
filled with the goodness of God
-- that really goes to the heart

00:07:48.394 --> 00:07:52.381
of Milton's theodicy.
Because of this infusion of

00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:55.600
divinity -- because of it,
everything that God creates,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:01.438
every natural thing,
must on some level be naturally

00:08:01.438 --> 00:08:06.230
good, necessarily good.
I think this much makes

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:10.512
sense.But Raphael also
describes a moment in the

00:08:10.512 --> 00:08:13.458
Creation that,
I think, is a little more

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:16.920
difficult for us to reconcile
with what we know or what we

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.350
feel that we know of Milton's
monism.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.490
Look how this same passage
continues.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.915
This is line 237: 
[B]ut downward [the Holy

00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:30.692
Spirit is the subject of the
verb]

00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:33.612
purg'd
The black tartareous cold

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:36.357
Infernal dregs
Adverse to life:

00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:38.980
then founded,
then conglob'd

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.710
Like things to like,
the rest to several place

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:47.240
Disparted, and between spun out
the Air…

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:51.105
The Holy Spirit "downward
purg'd / The black tartareous

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:54.039
cold Infernal dregs / Adverse to
life."

00:08:54.039 --> 00:08:58.733
The Holy Spirit doesn't merely
infuse chaos with vital virtue

00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:02.777
and vital warmth.
It purges something from chaos,

00:09:02.777 --> 00:09:04.975
too.
It's this strange digestive

00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:08.744
moment in Milton's text that has
left students of Milton's

00:09:08.744 --> 00:09:12.579
theology and students of the
poem scratching their heads in

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:16.259
bewilderment,
and it's for some reason.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:20.913
Milton is usually so precise
and really every word and every

00:09:20.913 --> 00:09:25.330
image can almost always be
accounted for -- but dregs?

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:29.220
This is the question:
where did these dregs come

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.213
from?
Why are there any dregs in the

00:09:33.213 --> 00:09:40.039
inseminated space of chaos that
actually need to be purged?

00:09:40.039 --> 00:09:41.759
Think of the logic of Milton's
creation.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:46.229
God's infusion of vital virtue
and vital warmth should have

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:50.929
completely filled the matter of
chaos with spirit and life.

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:54.793
At least theoretically,
all matter should be steeped

00:09:54.793 --> 00:09:58.516
with spirit and energy and,
according to all of Milton's

00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:01.405
theories of this vitalist
universe in the Christian

00:10:01.405 --> 00:10:04.867
Doctrine,
there shouldn't be anything

00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:07.855
in Milton's creation,
technically,

00:10:07.855 --> 00:10:11.648
that's adverse to life.
This really is crucial for

00:10:11.648 --> 00:10:15.024
Milton's understanding of how
the universe is put together and

00:10:15.024 --> 00:10:17.617
it's crucial,
too, for his theodicy,

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:22.429
but these dregs here are simply
-- there's no other way to read

00:10:22.429 --> 00:10:26.852
them: they are dead and they are
inert.I'm going to be

00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:31.664
applying some pressure to these
lines because what we have here

00:10:31.664 --> 00:10:35.700
is a moment of some metaphysical
incoherence,

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.807
and it's metaphysical
incoherence at the very heart of

00:10:38.807 --> 00:10:40.860
Milton's account of the
creation.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.029
This incoherence is announced
with that wonderful word,

00:10:45.029 --> 00:10:48.350
"dregs," that Milton weighs
down so much.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.072
He weighs it down with well,
four contiguous adjectives:

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:57.708
"black," "tartareous" -- what
an awkward line -- "black

00:10:57.708 --> 00:11:02.370
tartareous cold Infernal dregs."
I've spent a lot of time

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.903
thinking about these lines,
and I've also written about

00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:09.064
this problem,
and so I'm going to ask that

00:11:09.064 --> 00:11:12.917
you to permit me a little
digression -- not that you

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:16.552
really have a choice,
but I'm just announcing to you

00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:19.651
this fact that I will be
digressing now.What I'm

00:11:19.651 --> 00:11:21.899
going to do is give you my
theory,

00:11:21.899 --> 00:11:27.429
my pet theory,
of Milton's tartareous dregs.

00:11:27.429 --> 00:11:30.577
I'm convinced here that Milton
is participating in a

00:11:30.577 --> 00:11:33.601
contemporary conversation
involving one of his pet

00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:36.440
subjects and one of his favorite
subjects,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.576
which is that of digestion.
This is a debate -- and

00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:42.736
certainly it's not Milton's
debate, this is one that he

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:46.307
inherits -- it's a debate about
those indigestible elements of

00:11:46.307 --> 00:11:49.292
food known as dregs in the
sixteenth and seventeenth

00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:52.830
century,
also known as tartar.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.031
I'm going to give you a little
bit of information about the

00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:56.360
Renaissance philosophy of
tartar,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.100
if you can believe it there is
such a thing,

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:05.408
because I think it provides a
good example of just the kind of

00:12:05.408 --> 00:12:09.932
seemingly cockamamie
contemporary philosophical world

00:12:09.932 --> 00:12:14.716
that a lot of early modern
intellectuals inhabit.The

00:12:14.716 --> 00:12:19.153
key figure in the science of
dregs and tartar is the

00:12:19.153 --> 00:12:24.200
sixteenth-century German
philosopher Paracelsus.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.536
Literally, tartareous dregs are
simply the residue,

00:12:28.536 --> 00:12:32.440
the sediment,
produced by wine and vinegar.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.085
We still have a substance --
and if you cook you are familiar

00:12:36.085 --> 00:12:39.122
with this -- a substance made of
vinegar sediments,

00:12:39.122 --> 00:12:41.309
and it's called cream of
tartar.

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:46.578
Well, Paracelsus had actually
developed an entire philosophy

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:50.954
which had as its center his
understanding of these

00:12:50.954 --> 00:12:54.772
tartareous dregs,
so tartar for Paracelsus was

00:12:54.772 --> 00:12:58.725
the stuff that hardened into
stones within the gallbladder

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:02.209
and within the kidney.
This was the explanation for

00:13:02.209 --> 00:13:05.707
gallstones or kidney stones,
and tartar was also the same

00:13:05.707 --> 00:13:09.330
material that formed a hardened
yellowish substance that we

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:13.169
still call,
of course, tartar of the teeth.

00:13:13.169 --> 00:13:16.470
Milton in the seventeenth
century would have called it

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:19.895
"tooth tartar," and more
commonly it was known as "tooth

00:13:19.895 --> 00:13:21.646
stone."
For Paracelsus,

00:13:21.646 --> 00:13:25.271
if there's any natural
substance on this planet that

00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.470
can be identified unequivocally
with evil,

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.320
it is tartar,
and I mean metaphysical evil.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.690
Given the import of this
matter, Paracelsus was prompted

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.632
to ask the same question that we
are all [laughs]

00:13:39.632 --> 00:13:42.880
prone to ask when we're
squirming on the dentist chair

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.312
as we're having our teeth
cleaned: where in the hell does

00:13:46.312 --> 00:13:49.436
this stuff come from?
Paracelsus' answer to this

00:13:49.436 --> 00:13:52.648
question was a theological one,
which is why I think Milton was

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:55.718
so interested in it,
although Milton eventually had

00:13:55.718 --> 00:13:59.474
to reject it altogether.Now
of course, I'm not suggesting

00:13:59.474 --> 00:14:03.167
that the central intellectual
context for understanding this

00:14:03.167 --> 00:14:07.049
part of Paradise Lost is
the history of dentistry or the

00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:11.120
history of oral hygiene.
Nonetheless we have a moment of

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.282
Milton's engagement with a
contemporary theory,

00:14:14.282 --> 00:14:18.840
however seemingly off the wall.
This is the theory of tartar,

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:23.052
which was easily as theological
and philosophical in the

00:14:23.052 --> 00:14:27.034
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries as it was dental:

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:29.202
okay,
so for Paracelsus,

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:33.956
tartar originates in the food
we eat, and the tartar that ends

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.620
up on your teeth is simply the
indigestible,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.340
unassimilable parts of that
food.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:45.215
For a lot of Paracelsus'
contemporaries this was an

00:14:45.215 --> 00:14:48.749
incredibly troubling theory.
A lot of Milton's

00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:52.162
contemporaries said so,
and so they had to reject

00:14:52.162 --> 00:14:56.145
completely the Paracelsian
theory -- you can guess why --

00:14:56.145 --> 00:14:58.990
because Paracelsus' theory
implied,

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:03.690
of course, that tartar had been
created by God -- it's part of

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.314
the natural world -- and that
God was somehow responsible for

00:15:08.314 --> 00:15:11.320
the origin of evil in his
creation.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.465
And so you have philosophers
and theologians in the

00:15:14.465 --> 00:15:17.861
seventeenth century weighing in
on the tartar question,

00:15:17.861 --> 00:15:21.297
on the origin of dregs.
Of course, for the most part

00:15:21.297 --> 00:15:24.835
they're obliged to attack
Paracelsus.The entire tartar

00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:28.187
controversy and all of the
things that this controversy

00:15:28.187 --> 00:15:32.159
suggests about the nature of
divine justice -- all of this,

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:37.102
I think, gets compacted into
this one truly extraordinary

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:41.250
line: "black tartareous cold
Infernal dregs."

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:45.455
Milton is using this incredibly
striking and strange sequence of

00:15:45.455 --> 00:15:48.993
words at this point in his
creation account because he

00:15:48.993 --> 00:15:53.065
wants to open up the question
for his contemporary audience --

00:15:53.065 --> 00:15:55.796
it's,
of course, lost on us -- the

00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:58.789
question of the nature of divine
justice.

00:15:58.789 --> 00:16:02.112
Milton, I think,
in Book Seven is relatively

00:16:02.112 --> 00:16:06.671
torn about the kind of God that
he wants or that he needs to

00:16:06.671 --> 00:16:10.618
represent in the poem.
Is Milton's God the punitive

00:16:10.618 --> 00:16:14.909
and arbitrary God -- something
like an anthropomorphic deity,

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:19.620
a God capable,
as Paracelsus had suggested,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:25.119
of actually creating evil?
Or is he a God from a slightly

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:29.602
later deistic perspective,
a God that we can identify with

00:16:29.602 --> 00:16:34.399
the more rational or the more
natural processes implied in the

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:38.804
theory of monism in which
everything in God's creation is

00:16:38.804 --> 00:16:43.522
just necessarily infused with
divinity and therefore good and

00:16:43.522 --> 00:16:48.399
alive and in some way capable of
virtue?This is the type of

00:16:48.399 --> 00:16:52.645
question that Milton is asking
throughout Book Seven of

00:16:52.645 --> 00:16:57.777
Paradise Lost.
One of the ways that Milton

00:16:57.777 --> 00:17:02.420
stages this problem is by
turning for inspiration to

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.789
competing sources of
authoritative knowledge.

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:09.710
Milton has, on the one hand,
the authority of scripture.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:12.450
You can see that although
scripture tells us a lot of

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.718
things, one of the things that
it seems authoritatively to tell

00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:18.090
us is that it gives us a
representation of the

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:21.835
anthropomorphic,
punitive deity -- at least in

00:17:21.835 --> 00:17:25.735
the Hebrew Bible.
Milton also has to support this

00:17:25.735 --> 00:17:30.401
view more or less the authority
of a philosopher like Paracelsus

00:17:30.401 --> 00:17:34.844
who had an image of a similar
although differently configured

00:17:34.844 --> 00:17:39.065
image of a punitive deity
capable of creating evil.But

00:17:39.065 --> 00:17:43.435
what kind of authority does
Milton have for representing the

00:17:43.435 --> 00:17:46.990
other kind of deity:
the force of life,

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.851
or the energy,
that might actually be much

00:17:49.851 --> 00:17:53.062
more rationally recognizable or
accessible to a

00:17:53.062 --> 00:17:57.250
seventeenth-century scientific
contemporary of Milton's?

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.637
Well, we don't have scientists
in the seventeenth century,

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:03.847
technically.
We have natural philosophers:

00:18:03.847 --> 00:18:07.865
so what is the basis of
authority for contemporary

00:18:07.865 --> 00:18:11.218
natural philosophy?
The question of authority and

00:18:11.218 --> 00:18:14.210
authoritative knowledge is
central to the middle books,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:17.408
not just Book Seven but to all
the central books of Paradise

00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:19.798
Lost.
Raphael is presenting Adam

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:23.651
and Eve with something like a
quick education in universal

00:18:23.651 --> 00:18:26.071
knowledge,
and the basis or the authority

00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:29.207
for this knowledge is constantly
under question in these books

00:18:29.207 --> 00:18:32.188
because so much of Raphael's
discourse has no foundation --

00:18:32.188 --> 00:18:35.374
and this makes Milton nervous --
has no foundation in scripture

00:18:35.374 --> 00:18:37.947
whatsoever.
The Bible simply can't be

00:18:37.947 --> 00:18:41.769
counted on as an exclusive
source of universal knowledge,

00:18:41.769 --> 00:18:45.995
and so Milton has no choice but
to turn to other forms of

00:18:45.995 --> 00:18:49.467
authority and one of them is
science or natural

00:18:49.467 --> 00:18:53.844
philosophy.And so Milton at
the beginning of Book Seven

00:18:53.844 --> 00:18:58.461
invokes the muse of science,
the muse of astronomy,

00:18:58.461 --> 00:19:03.009
at the beginning.
So look at the invocation.

00:19:03.009 --> 00:19:09.096
This is page 345 of the
Hughes, the opening

00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:12.347
lines.
It's here in Book Seven and

00:19:12.347 --> 00:19:17.532
only here that Milton names his
muse, and the muse turns out to

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.776
be Urania.
Without question,

00:19:19.776 --> 00:19:22.700
of course, she's a feminine
presence here.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.725
In the muse's earlier
incarnations in Books One and

00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:28.751
Three, there was some
uncertainty as to whether the

00:19:28.751 --> 00:19:32.442
Heavenly Spirit was a masculine
figure capable of impregnating

00:19:32.442 --> 00:19:35.710
chaos and who will now
impregnate Milton's mind,

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.748
or whether the heavenly Spirit
was a feminine spirit,

00:19:39.748 --> 00:19:43.865
a feminine power that
"dove-like satst brooding on the

00:19:43.865 --> 00:19:48.525
vast Abyss" or similarly sat
brooding on the brooding mind of

00:19:48.525 --> 00:19:51.492
the poet.
But Book Seven is all about

00:19:51.492 --> 00:19:53.895
birth.
It's all about generation and

00:19:53.895 --> 00:19:56.765
creation, and Milton requires
for this book,

00:19:56.765 --> 00:19:59.747
I think,
an unequivocally feminine muse,

00:19:59.747 --> 00:20:04.096
a maternal muse who was there
when the world was born and who

00:20:04.096 --> 00:20:08.300
will serve here now as the
nurturing mother of Milton's own

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.490
poem.Now Milton -- who's
committed,

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.806
of course, to the truth of the
Bible and similarly committed,

00:20:16.806 --> 00:20:20.243
at least in part,
to a lot of the truths coming

00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:23.751
out in the world of natural
philosophy -- Milton's on shaky

00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:26.109
ground as he describes the
creation.

00:20:26.109 --> 00:20:29.836
His invocation is filled with
something like -- and it seems

00:20:29.836 --> 00:20:33.120
absolutely authentic -- a fear
of religious error.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.698
Look at line nineteen.
Milton conjures the fear of

00:20:36.698 --> 00:20:42.108
falling off Pegasus -- Pegasus,
the flying steed of poetry,

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:46.119
"erroneous there to wander and
forlorn."

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:50.016
Book Seven, especially this
invocation, is the focus for an

00:20:50.016 --> 00:20:53.039
enormous amount of Milton's
poetic anxiety.

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:56.759
You can measure the degree of
Milton's poetic anxiety here by

00:20:56.759 --> 00:21:00.230
the reappearance of that figure
that Milton has called on

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.640
throughout his career at moments
of intensest fear,

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.875
or intensest isolation,
and that's the figure of

00:21:08.875 --> 00:21:11.994
Orpheus.
Orpheus' mother was the muse

00:21:11.994 --> 00:21:14.500
Calliope, the muse of epic
poetry.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.911
She had been incapable of
saving her son when he was

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.670
dismembered by the followers of
Bacchus, the Bacchae.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.938
Milton implores Urania here at
the beginning of Book Seven to

00:21:27.938 --> 00:21:31.780
outdo Calliope and to spare him
the fate of Orpheus.

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:37.983
Look at line 30: 
[S]till govern thou my

00:21:37.983 --> 00:21:42.434
Song,
Urania, and fit audience find,

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:46.170
though few.
But drive far off the barbarous

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.064
dissonance
Of Bacchus and his Revellers,

00:21:49.064 --> 00:21:53.301
the Race
Of that wild Rout that tore the

00:21:53.301 --> 00:21:57.222
Thracian Bard
In Rhodope, where Woods and

00:21:57.222 --> 00:22:00.760
Rocks had Ears
To rapture, till the savage

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.750
clamor drown'd
Both Harp and Voice;

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:09.529
nor could the Muse defend
Her Son.

00:22:09.529 --> 00:22:12.630
So fail not thou,
who thee implores:

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:18.160
For thou art Heavn'ly,
shee an empty dream.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.730
Now, Urania is the traditional
name for the patroness of

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.375
astronomy.
If this muse of astronomical

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:27.972
wisdom is not truly governing
Milton's song -- if she's

00:22:27.972 --> 00:22:31.902
nothing more than the projection
of Milton's most outrageous

00:22:31.902 --> 00:22:35.966
poetic ambitions -- then Milton
will have no authority backing

00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:39.430
the poem's extraordinary claims
to knowledge.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.369
Milton is, I think,
really going on a limb in

00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:46.378
Paradise Lost as he's
claiming what is essentially the

00:22:46.378 --> 00:22:50.187
status of divine truth for
thousands of lines in this poem

00:22:50.187 --> 00:22:54.329
that really have no foundation
in holy scripture at all.

00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:58.400
Think of what we've just read
that I haven't spoken to at all:

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.269
book Six, the story of the war
in heaven,

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:08.009
is a story that doesn't,
in effect, appear in the Bible.

00:23:08.009 --> 00:23:10.890
There's a sense in this
allusion to Orpheus that this

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.771
poetic endeavor of Milton's is
attended by really the

00:23:13.771 --> 00:23:17.124
profoundest risks.
Milton implores the muse,

00:23:17.124 --> 00:23:21.650
"so fail not thou," as Calliope
had failed, of course,

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:25.012
Orpheus.
Behind this cry lurks a kind of

00:23:25.012 --> 00:23:28.998
nagging fear that Urania,
too, may turn out to be an

00:23:28.998 --> 00:23:31.890
empty dream: the fear that
Urania,

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.420
just like Calliope,
will turn out to be nothing

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:39.718
more than a convenient fiction
dreamt up by a desperately

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:44.246
ambitious poet.But there's
another reason that Milton is

00:23:44.246 --> 00:23:49.140
invoking a feminine muse here.
He wants in this next section

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.400
of the poem to establish a new
perspective for this book of

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:57.038
universal knowledge,
and he's relying on a new muse

00:23:57.038 --> 00:24:01.064
to liberate him in some way from
the strictures of the orthodox

00:24:01.064 --> 00:24:04.311
forms of knowledge that are
sanctioned seemingly so

00:24:04.311 --> 00:24:08.582
unequivocally by the Bible.
Milton's struggling to balance

00:24:08.582 --> 00:24:12.018
the dominant theological
discourse with this new

00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:16.769
discourse, this new language of
science or natural philosophy.

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:20.651
So what you have in Book Seven
is a really startling opposition

00:24:20.651 --> 00:24:24.157
of essentially competing forms
of knowledge and competing

00:24:24.157 --> 00:24:27.187
images of authority.
Milton will invariably -- how

00:24:27.187 --> 00:24:29.512
can he not?
And he does this authentically:

00:24:29.512 --> 00:24:32.569
he acknowledges the validity of
a scriptural account of a

00:24:32.569 --> 00:24:36.143
natural phenomenon,
but he will only do so in order

00:24:36.143 --> 00:24:40.737
to set the scripture aside at
some point and begin to explore

00:24:40.737 --> 00:24:43.569
an entirely different
perspective,

00:24:43.569 --> 00:24:46.755
an entirely different account,
of the same

00:24:46.755 --> 00:24:51.650
phenomenon.Let's look at an
example of this at the bottom of

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.269
page 355.
This is Book Seven, line 387.

00:24:56.269 --> 00:25:01.700
Look at what Milton does with
the Genesis account of creation.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.339
Here we have the fifth day of
creation;

00:25:04.339 --> 00:25:09.380
this is when the God of Genesis
creates fish and fowl.

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.404
Milton begins the account here
with a dutiful and humble

00:25:13.404 --> 00:25:17.107
transcription of Genesis,
and in some cases the verse is

00:25:17.107 --> 00:25:20.276
actually a word-for-word
transcription of the King James

00:25:20.276 --> 00:25:23.436
translation,
in some cases the Geneva

00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:26.490
translation.
You can see the King James

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.913
translation in the footnotes.
Sometimes Milton will normally

00:25:30.913 --> 00:25:35.423
fiddle with just a couple of
words to make the Genesis text

00:25:35.423 --> 00:25:39.390
fit into the metrical scheme of
his blank verse.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:44.802
Look at line 387: 
And God said,

00:25:44.802 --> 00:25:49.539
let the Waters generate
Reptile with Spawn abundant,

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:52.200
living Soul:
And let Fowl fly above the

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.359
Earth, with wings
Display'd on the op'n Firmament

00:25:55.359 --> 00:25:57.552
of Heav'n.
And God created the great

00:25:57.552 --> 00:26:01.020
Whales…
And so on and so forth all the

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.366
way up to 398:
"And let the Fowl be multipli'd

00:26:04.366 --> 00:26:07.791
on the Earth."
These lines have to be -- and

00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:11.965
they've certainly been cited as
such since the eighteenth

00:26:11.965 --> 00:26:15.170
century -- they have to be the
flattest,

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.009
the least interesting lines in
the entire poem.

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:22.157
One of Milton's first editors,
this is on the handout,

00:26:22.157 --> 00:26:23.998
Dr.
Bentley, had actually argued

00:26:23.998 --> 00:26:27.264
that these lines were so bad
that they just needed to be

00:26:27.264 --> 00:26:29.579
deleted from the text
altogether.

00:26:29.579 --> 00:26:32.846
Bentley's thesis was [laughs]
an ingenious one:

00:26:32.846 --> 00:26:36.821
that Milton actually isn't
responsible for these lines at

00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:38.285
all.
According to Dr.

00:26:38.285 --> 00:26:41.252
Bentley, sometimes the
amanuensis -- the young man who

00:26:41.252 --> 00:26:44.779
would act as secretary and take
down the next installment of ten

00:26:44.779 --> 00:26:47.914
lines or fifteen lines or
whatever -- would just [laughs]

00:26:47.914 --> 00:26:51.329
start making things up or
didn't hear Milton properly.

00:26:51.329 --> 00:26:55.317
A lot of the lines that Bentley
most disliked were to be

00:26:55.317 --> 00:26:59.831
dismissed for just this reason,
that they clearly had nothing

00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:03.636
to do with Milton's own
composition.Bentley asked

00:27:03.636 --> 00:27:07.207
this question,
and it's a good question:

00:27:07.207 --> 00:27:12.700
why should Raphael be so tied
up to the letter in Genesis,

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.502
Raphael who makes this
narrative thousands of years

00:27:16.502 --> 00:27:20.750
before Genesis was writ?
Not a bad question.

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.247
Dr.
Bentley reasonably asks,

00:27:23.247 --> 00:27:27.687
"If Raphael came before Moses,
long before Moses,

00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:31.829
why is he quoting Moses?"
Why indeed?

00:27:31.829 --> 00:27:35.088
What might be the significance
of Milton's being tied up to the

00:27:35.088 --> 00:27:38.500
letter in Genesis?
Milton begins his account of

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.472
the fifth day of creation by
paying homage to the scriptural

00:27:43.472 --> 00:27:46.759
source for his own creation
account,

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:50.030
but that's, of course,
not where Milton ends.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.377
Look at line 399.
After Milton has exhausted --

00:27:53.377 --> 00:27:55.963
thank God!
-- he's exhausted his bald

00:27:55.963 --> 00:28:00.080
versification of the King James
Bible, he lets loose with an

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.080
entirely new representation of
creation.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:08.124
Listen to this: 
Forthwith the Sounds and

00:28:08.124 --> 00:28:12.550
Seas, each Creek and Bay
With Fry innumerable swarm,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.865
and Shoals
Of Fish that with thir Fins and

00:28:15.865 --> 00:28:19.326
shining Scales
Glide under the green Wave,

00:28:19.326 --> 00:28:24.190
in Sculls that oft
Bank the mid Sea…

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:28.101
Milton takes the austerity of
Genesis and amplifies it with

00:28:28.101 --> 00:28:31.473
some of the lushest,
most luxuriant verse in all of

00:28:31.473 --> 00:28:34.897
Paradise Lost.
I urge you all to read these

00:28:34.897 --> 00:28:37.690
lines out loud in the privacy of
your homes.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:40.365
So much of this poem has to be
experienced in your mouth,

00:28:40.365 --> 00:28:42.085
I'm convinced,
before it can fully be

00:28:42.085 --> 00:28:43.800
appreciated.
This is, in fact,

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:47.117
how Milton experienced it.
He experienced it sonically

00:28:47.117 --> 00:28:51.200
because he was blind and wasn't
able to read it on the page.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.974
This particular description of
the fish and fowl continues for

00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:57.450
another perfectly amazing forty
lines.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.489
It's an extraordinary tour
de force.The sounds of

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:05.049
water of which Milton speaks at
line 300 here are,

00:29:05.049 --> 00:29:09.985
of course, the bodies of water
that are suddenly filled with an

00:29:09.985 --> 00:29:13.250
enormous variety of aquatic life
forms;

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:16.738
but the sounds that emerge
forthwith in this passage are

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:20.670
also the sounds of this amazing
burst of imaginative poetry.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.396
The verse here explodes with a
kind of sonic energy that had

00:29:25.396 --> 00:29:28.686
been entirely repressed,
or suppressed,

00:29:28.686 --> 00:29:32.734
during Milton's lifeless
adherence to scripture:

00:29:32.734 --> 00:29:37.300
"And Shoales / Of Fish that
with thir Fins and shining

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:40.660
Scales" -- Milton's swimming
here.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.343
He's loving every moment of it
-- you know it-- in a sensual,

00:29:44.343 --> 00:29:48.149
alliterative verse that almost
completely drowns out our memory

00:29:48.149 --> 00:29:51.710
of the bland King James English
of the previous lines.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.314
This demonstration of poetic
strength coincides with Milton's

00:29:55.314 --> 00:29:58.438
new sense of the strength,
or a new sense of a force,

00:29:58.438 --> 00:30:02.025
behind creation.
He takes the masculine image of

00:30:02.025 --> 00:30:05.950
God's verbal command from
Genesis, "And God said,"

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.578
and he replaces it with an
alternative feminine conception

00:30:10.578 --> 00:30:14.963
of creation that places the
power of creation in Nature

00:30:14.963 --> 00:30:20.160
herself.In his description
of the first schools of fish,

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:23.672
Milton, I think,
is subscribing or can be seen

00:30:23.672 --> 00:30:27.810
to subscribe to a new and daring
school of thought.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:34.760
Look at the sixth day, line 450.
Milton begins -- and we've seen

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:37.813
him do this before -- he
scrupulously follows the Genesis

00:30:37.813 --> 00:30:39.185
text.
This is Genesis:

00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:41.701
"And God said,
Let the earth bring forth the

00:30:41.701 --> 00:30:45.718
living creature after his kind,
cattle and creeping thing,

00:30:45.718 --> 00:30:50.009
and beast of the earth after
his kind, and it was so."

00:30:50.009 --> 00:30:54.077
Milton reproduces the
scriptural description nearly

00:30:54.077 --> 00:30:58.144
verbatim, but he very
scrupulously omits that final

00:30:58.144 --> 00:31:01.480
clause from Genesis,
"and it was so";

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.079
because he wonders well,
how was it so?

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:08.526
The Genesis account of creation
is clearly inadequate here

00:31:08.526 --> 00:31:11.488
because it relies on some
mystical or some magical

00:31:11.488 --> 00:31:14.329
fulfillment of the Father's
divine command.

00:31:14.329 --> 00:31:17.601
Genesis refuses to provide a
rational or something like a

00:31:17.601 --> 00:31:21.281
natural explanation for how the
creation of "cattle and creeping

00:31:21.281 --> 00:31:24.669
thing" came to be so.Now in
the years of the Scientific

00:31:24.669 --> 00:31:28.349
Revolution in the later years of
the seventeenth century,

00:31:28.349 --> 00:31:32.690
the Genesis account of creation
was coming under a lot of

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.494
scrutiny and the phrase "And God
said" was increasingly seen as

00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:41.307
-- this is inadequate,
this is an insufficiently

00:31:41.307 --> 00:31:44.039
believable form of natural
causation.

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:47.844
There was a pressure felt by a
lot of intellectuals to imagine

00:31:47.844 --> 00:31:50.734
another form,
a more naturalistic force or

00:31:50.734 --> 00:31:54.015
power of causation,
at work, and this is exactly

00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:59.118
what Milton himself does.
He replaces the biblical phrase

00:31:59.118 --> 00:32:04.601
"And it was so" with a
spectacularly naturalistic drama

00:32:04.601 --> 00:32:09.070
of what we can think of as
self-creation.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:14.275
Look what Milton does.
The Earth obey'd,

00:32:14.275 --> 00:32:17.789
and strait
Op'ning her fertile Womb teem'd

00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:20.986
at a Birth
Innumerous living Creatures,

00:32:20.986 --> 00:32:23.704
perfet forms,
Limb'd and full

00:32:23.704 --> 00:32:27.789
grown…
Invoking a Mother Earth -- of

00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:32.359
course, this Mother Earth obeys
the Heavenly Father' but Milton,

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:35.253
by invoking her,
is performing an operation

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:39.799
similar to the strategy that he
had performed in the invocation.

00:32:39.799 --> 00:32:42.912
He's countering the entirely
masculine force behind the

00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:45.680
Genesis creation with a new
feminine presence.

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.045
The female earth may just
demonstrate her initial

00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:52.130
obedience and subordination to
the Father,

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.932
but after this humbling of
herself, she's empowered to

00:32:55.932 --> 00:33:00.453
produce -- and she does this on
her own -- all of the innumerous

00:33:00.453 --> 00:33:03.422
living creatures.
Milton's imagining here a

00:33:03.422 --> 00:33:06.758
female authority distinct from
the authority of the Father

00:33:06.758 --> 00:33:09.039
who's issuing these verbal
commands.

00:33:09.039 --> 00:33:12.147
He depicts this new source of
creative power by drawing on a

00:33:12.147 --> 00:33:14.728
literary authority quite
distinct from the Book of

00:33:14.728 --> 00:33:17.845
Genesis.
The image of the earth opening

00:33:17.845 --> 00:33:21.573
up her fertile womb actually
comes from Ovid's

00:33:21.573 --> 00:33:24.521
Metamorphoses.
Interestingly,

00:33:24.521 --> 00:33:28.756
this comes from the section of
the Metamorphoses that

00:33:28.756 --> 00:33:32.559
describes life after the flood:
Deucalion's flood,

00:33:32.559 --> 00:33:37.924
seen by Christian readers in
Milton's day as a classical

00:33:37.924 --> 00:33:41.960
version of Noah's flood.
So it's a fallen phenomenon

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.016
that Milton is placing well
before the Fall.But what

00:33:45.016 --> 00:33:48.405
Milton does after this point in
this passage doesn't even have

00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:54.279
an authority in Ovid.
Look at line [laughs] 463.

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:58.254
Milton begins to represent what
may have seemed to less

00:33:58.254 --> 00:34:01.640
courageous poets as utterly
unrepresentable.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.706
This is the actual birthing of
these living forms,

00:34:05.706 --> 00:34:10.603
the emergence of cattle and
creeping things from the fertile

00:34:10.603 --> 00:34:13.840
womb of the living earth,
line 463.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:23.530
This gets me:
"The grassy Clods now Calv'd."

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:31.016
The grassy clods of earth are
actually opening up and giving

00:34:31.016 --> 00:34:35.539
birth to calves.
It's an amazingly daring

00:34:35.539 --> 00:34:39.173
sequence of five words.
It's a spectacular image of

00:34:39.173 --> 00:34:41.389
creation.
The grassy Clods now

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:44.347
Calv'd, now half appear'd
The Tawny Lion,

00:34:44.347 --> 00:34:47.296
pawing to get free
His hinder parts,

00:34:47.296 --> 00:34:50.010
then springs as broke from
Bonds,

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.510
And Rampant shakes his Brinded
mane…

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:56.817
You'll note at the bottom of
the page that Merritt Hughes

00:34:56.817 --> 00:34:58.590
tells us -- and I love this
about Hughes,

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.382
that he gives us this footnote
-- that the Romantic poet Samuel

00:35:01.382 --> 00:35:03.679
Taylor Coleridge had singled out
just this image,

00:35:03.679 --> 00:35:07.780
the image of the tawny lion,
as unworthy of Milton's gifts

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.386
as poet.
You can see what offended

00:35:10.386 --> 00:35:14.840
Coleridge and what presumably
also offends Merritt Hughes.

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.201
There is more than just a
little breach of decorum in this

00:35:19.201 --> 00:35:23.409
image of a lion wiggling his
bottom in order to free his

00:35:23.409 --> 00:35:26.238
hinder parts.
Milton's not only portraying

00:35:26.238 --> 00:35:29.515
the lion's attempt to give birth
to itself, which is no small

00:35:29.515 --> 00:35:32.300
feat as it paws its way out of
the earth's womb.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.409
He's also depicting something
like a liberation of sexual

00:35:36.409 --> 00:35:39.145
energy.
There's an emblem of the erotic

00:35:39.145 --> 00:35:42.960
charge that Milton is giving so
much of this nonscriptural

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.039
material in Book Seven of
Paradise Lost.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:49.927
When the lion springs "as
broke from Bonds," there's a

00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:53.337
sense that Milton is
representing his own springing

00:35:53.337 --> 00:35:57.225
from the confining bonds of a
scriptural tradition that is

00:35:57.225 --> 00:36:00.090
insufficiently literarily
inspiring.

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.548
It's also a liberation fully
akin to his poetic escape,

00:36:03.548 --> 00:36:05.789
we'll remember,
from the tyranny,

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:08.021
the bondage,
of rhyme.Now,

00:36:08.021 --> 00:36:12.099
throughout so much of
Paradise Lost, the

00:36:12.099 --> 00:36:16.716
lines of hierarchical authority
seem to be incredibly clearly

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:19.414
drawn,
but in Book Seven Milton begins

00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:22.677
to experiment a little more
freely with forms of authority

00:36:22.677 --> 00:36:25.883
and images of hierarchy that
actually counter more of the

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:29.489
orthodox notions that he finds
in the Bible -- or in fact,

00:36:29.489 --> 00:36:32.289
that he finds in the culture at
large.

00:36:32.289 --> 00:36:35.861
The book itself is inspired by
a distinctly feminine muse,

00:36:35.861 --> 00:36:38.179
and in its description of
creation,

00:36:38.179 --> 00:36:42.154
there's a significant degree of
autonomy granted to this

00:36:42.154 --> 00:36:44.756
feminine power,
the Earth -- this new

00:36:44.756 --> 00:36:47.820
phenomenon,
the Earth.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:51.431
Now Book Eight would seem in a
lot of ways to put an end to

00:36:51.431 --> 00:36:54.730
this, what would seem to be a
provisional or momentary

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:58.952
celebration of feminine energy.
In fact, Book Eight seems to

00:36:58.952 --> 00:37:02.600
reassert the subordination of
woman to man that had

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.269
characterized our first glimpse
of Adam and Eve in Book Four.

00:37:07.269 --> 00:37:11.040
You'll remember that it's in
Book Eight that Adam recounts

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.074
for Raphael the request that he
had made to God for a partner,

00:37:15.074 --> 00:37:17.942
some fellow human.
He specifically asked God for

00:37:17.942 --> 00:37:19.973
an equal.
This is Book Eight,

00:37:19.973 --> 00:37:24.198
line 382: For "mong unequals
what society / Can sort,

00:37:24.198 --> 00:37:28.988
what harmony or true delight?"
Adam asks.But God didn't

00:37:28.988 --> 00:37:33.280
seem all that interested in
granting Adam's request for an

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:36.070
equal partner,
and Raphael's continually

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:38.969
urging Adam to remember his
superiority to Eve.

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:43.197
He mustn't mistake Eve's beauty
for nobility or wisdom or

00:37:43.197 --> 00:37:47.500
equality, and of course,
that has been Adam's tendency.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:53.916
Raphael famously contracts his
brow when Adam shows a tendency

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:57.969
to idolize his wife,
and whenever the conversation

00:37:57.969 --> 00:38:01.630
turns to Adam's relation to Eve,
Raphael expresses a fixed and

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:04.989
inflexible opinion on the matter
of sexual hierarchy.

00:38:04.989 --> 00:38:09.820
One sex clearly has a priority
over the other.But Book

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:14.650
Eight is also concerned with
another kind of hierarchy,

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:19.506
the hierarchy of the heavens:
the relations of the heavenly

00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:21.852
bodies.
Raphael and Adam also in Book

00:38:21.852 --> 00:38:25.148
Eight discuss at considerable
length the relative position in

00:38:25.148 --> 00:38:27.730
space of the sun and the earth
and the moon.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:31.471
Does the sun travel around the
earth, which remains fixed at

00:38:31.471 --> 00:38:35.530
the center of the universe as
the medieval Ptolemy had argued,

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.917
or does the earth revolve
around the sun as the early

00:38:38.917 --> 00:38:42.630
modern Copernicus and then later
Galileo had theorized?

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.710
Adam, of course,
isn't certain,

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:48.246
though it certainly looks to
him, as it looks to us,

00:38:48.246 --> 00:38:51.090
as if the sun moves around the
earth.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:55.861
Now Adam's uncertainty here is
only reasonable but [laughs]

00:38:55.861 --> 00:39:00.715
the remarkable aspect of this
dialogue is that the Archangel

00:39:00.715 --> 00:39:04.836
Raphael isn't certain either.
Raphael doesn't really know

00:39:04.836 --> 00:39:07.388
which way [laughs]
the planets revolve even though

00:39:07.388 --> 00:39:10.306
he has spent much of this very
morning on his flight from

00:39:10.306 --> 00:39:13.136
heaven to earth,
where presumably he had some

00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:16.237
opportunity to observe the
workings of the heavenly

00:39:16.237 --> 00:39:19.413
planets.
It appears that God has made it

00:39:19.413 --> 00:39:23.918
difficult even for the angels to
discern the hierarchical

00:39:23.918 --> 00:39:28.286
structure of the cosmos.
There's an illegibility about

00:39:28.286 --> 00:39:31.770
hierarchy built in to the
system.Of course,

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:36.163
by the mid-seventeenth century
the jury was still out as to

00:39:36.163 --> 00:39:40.480
whether the universe was
heliocentric or geocentric,

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.940
and Milton wasn't alone in
expressing some uncertainty.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.889
You could say,
and it has been said,

00:39:45.889 --> 00:39:48.340
that it was wise of him to
hedge his bets;

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:52.257
but there's a lot more going on
in the discussions of astronomy

00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:56.112
than just a serious desire to
get to the bottom of a difficult

00:39:56.112 --> 00:39:58.449
contemporary scientific
question.

00:39:58.449 --> 00:40:02.365
There's way too much made of
Raphael's confusion here and his

00:40:02.365 --> 00:40:04.780
uncertainty about cosmic
hierarchy.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:08.879
The sun and the earth,
or the sun and the moon,

00:40:08.879 --> 00:40:13.487
are deliberately gendered here.
Milton uses the traditional

00:40:13.487 --> 00:40:17.132
gender assignments of these
heavenly bodies that he inherits

00:40:17.132 --> 00:40:20.359
from the Latin language,
and he holds to them

00:40:20.359 --> 00:40:23.010
scrupulously throughout the
poem.

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:27.321
The sun is always masculine,
and the earth and the moon are

00:40:27.321 --> 00:40:30.245
always feminine.
The controversy about the

00:40:30.245 --> 00:40:33.226
priority of the heavenly bodies
is, in some way,

00:40:33.226 --> 00:40:36.968
Milton's reformulation of the
controversy about the priority

00:40:36.968 --> 00:40:40.153
of the sexes.
The field of astronomy provides

00:40:40.153 --> 00:40:43.976
Milton with something like a
scientific discourse about the

00:40:43.976 --> 00:40:46.315
sexes,
an alternative source of

00:40:46.315 --> 00:40:50.677
knowledge that permits him to
counteract the more traditional

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:53.949
and more theological account of
the sexes,

00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:58.309
assimilable from his culture
but also from the Bible.Look

00:40:58.309 --> 00:41:02.524
at page 366 in the Hughes.
Raphael's certainty about

00:41:02.524 --> 00:41:06.593
sexual hierarchy in the human
sphere seems to give way to

00:41:06.593 --> 00:41:10.154
nothing but doubts and
uncertainty as soon as that

00:41:10.154 --> 00:41:13.860
hierarchy is extended to the
cosmic sphere.

00:41:13.860 --> 00:41:16.862
Science provides a different
kind of space:

00:41:16.862 --> 00:41:20.222
this is a discursive space for
a more liberated,

00:41:20.222 --> 00:41:23.940
a more open-ended discussion of
sexual politics.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:28.133
It provides Milton with an
opposing source for the

00:41:28.133 --> 00:41:32.325
knowledge about the sexes,
a knowledge that seemed so

00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:36.262
complete and so sewn up from the
theological point of view

00:41:36.262 --> 00:41:41.635
implicit in the Genesis account.
So on page 366 -- this is Book

00:41:41.635 --> 00:41:45.701
Eight, line 148.
Raphael is beginning to grow

00:41:45.701 --> 00:41:50.825
exceedingly speculative here,
and he dares to conjecture that

00:41:50.825 --> 00:41:55.865
there may exist out there in the
cosmos other suns and other

00:41:55.865 --> 00:41:57.920
moons:
[O]ther suns perhaps

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.300
With their attendant moons thou
wilt descry

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.349
Communicating Male and Female
Light,

00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:08.289
Which two great Sexes animate
the World,

00:42:08.289 --> 00:42:13.119
Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with
some that live.

00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:17.173
The two great sexes here that
communicate their light do so

00:42:17.173 --> 00:42:20.287
with an equal brilliance.
The greatness of one isn't

00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:22.176
emphasized here,
at least in these lines,

00:42:22.176 --> 00:42:25.162
at the expense of the other.
You'll remember with Adam and

00:42:25.162 --> 00:42:28.364
Eve in our first description of
them in their naked majesty --

00:42:28.364 --> 00:42:32.629
they were lords of all and,
presumably, equally lords of

00:42:32.629 --> 00:42:34.949
all.
When Raphael conjectures that

00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:38.817
some creatures might actually
live on these infinitely distant

00:42:38.817 --> 00:42:42.751
other suns and other moons,
he's pointing to an alternative

00:42:42.751 --> 00:42:46.683
conceptual world in which the
relation of the two great sexes

00:42:46.683 --> 00:42:50.157
might be configured altogether
differently.Raphael

00:42:50.157 --> 00:42:52.909
concludes the discussion at line
159,

00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:56.189
and he suggests essentially to
Adam that it's not Adam's place

00:42:56.189 --> 00:42:59.307
-- Adam should just cool it --
it's not his place to pursue

00:42:59.307 --> 00:43:02.050
these grand questions of
heavenly organization.

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:05.850
So this is Raphael:
"But whether thus these things,

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:09.195
or whether not,
/ Whether the Sun predominant

00:43:09.195 --> 00:43:14.469
in Heav'n / Rise on the Earth;
or Earth rise on the Sun..."

00:43:14.469 --> 00:43:17.480
Raphael's just telling us it
simply doesn't matter,

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:21.153
and he suggests a decisive --
if such a thing makes sense -- a

00:43:21.153 --> 00:43:24.344
decisive uncertainty about
whether the predominant sun

00:43:24.344 --> 00:43:27.896
rises on the earth or whether
the predominant earth rises on

00:43:27.896 --> 00:43:29.866
the sun.
One Milton critic,

00:43:29.866 --> 00:43:32.104
John Guillory,
has been absolutely right,

00:43:32.104 --> 00:43:34.510
I think -- he's the best reader
of this,

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:38.147
the whole problem -- in
suggesting that we can hear

00:43:38.147 --> 00:43:42.730
behind these lines the brooding
question of sexual hierarchy.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:46.059
Is the man on top or is the
woman on top?

00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:50.317
Is the masculine sex
predominant, or could it be that

00:43:50.317 --> 00:43:54.684
the feminine predominates?
When speaking about the sexes

00:43:54.684 --> 00:43:58.477
in the language of human
relations, Raphael is utterly

00:43:58.477 --> 00:44:01.840
definitive about who
predominates over whom,

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.642
but when he's speaking the
language of science he seems

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:08.603
baffled -- and it's lovable.
His confusion in the scientific

00:44:08.603 --> 00:44:13.409
realm can be seen to force us to
reconsider his certainty about

00:44:13.409 --> 00:44:18.481
relations in the human realm,
in the ethical realm.Now

00:44:18.481 --> 00:44:23.571
none of this is to say that
Milton is a feminist or even

00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:28.408
that Milton is a proto-feminist.
The question of what Milton

00:44:28.408 --> 00:44:32.019
actually believes about the
priority of the sexes is really,

00:44:32.019 --> 00:44:37.199
I think, too difficult to
discover or extract simply from

00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:41.646
a reading of the text.
This poem is far too filled

00:44:41.646 --> 00:44:46.593
with contradictions to give us
anything like a clear road map

00:44:46.593 --> 00:44:50.727
to Milton's own beliefs,
if it could even be said that

00:44:50.727 --> 00:44:54.477
he or any of us actually have
firm and fixed beliefs about

00:44:54.477 --> 00:44:58.293
such huge and consequential
matters as the relation between

00:44:58.293 --> 00:45:00.748
the sexes.
But it is, I think,

00:45:00.748 --> 00:45:05.387
possible to see that Milton is
struggling in some way to keep

00:45:05.387 --> 00:45:09.407
in suspension the competing
sources of knowledge that

00:45:09.407 --> 00:45:13.659
address this crucial question in
Paradise Lost,

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:16.710
the question of the
relation between the sexes.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.864
Milton's poem is -- we can't
deny this -- is a far more

00:45:20.864 --> 00:45:24.480
theological poem than it is a
scientific one,

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:27.943
but Milton will nonetheless use
the language of natural

00:45:27.943 --> 00:45:30.380
philosophy, the language of
science,

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.390
to open up some of the pressing
questions that his theology

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:39.492
seems to have closed down.
You can see Milton willingly

00:45:39.492 --> 00:45:43.036
placing himself in the role of
Raphael at just those moments

00:45:43.036 --> 00:45:45.800
when the archangel is discussing
astronomy.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.888
It's as if Milton,
just like that affable angel --

00:45:48.888 --> 00:45:52.544
and don't you love it that
Milton lets us know that Raphael

00:45:52.544 --> 00:45:55.721
is the affable angel,
quite unlike the Michael that

00:45:55.721 --> 00:45:57.710
we will meet in the last two
books?

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:00.379
-- as if Milton,
just like Raphael,

00:46:00.379 --> 00:46:04.777
were throwing his hands affably
up in the air in complete

00:46:04.777 --> 00:46:07.839
uncertainty and telling us,
the readers,

00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:10.615
"I don't know.
I don't know the answer to

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.951
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so I want to set up a new

00:00:04.951 --> 00:00:07.588
topic today, and to get us
started I thought we'd play a

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:09.540
game.
So the game is going to be

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.580
called cash in a hat,
and we'll see what this game is

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.316
like in a minute.
So the idea is this,

00:00:14.316 --> 00:00:15.250
there's going to be two
players.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.952
I'm going to pick on two of you.
I hope I can find people who

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:24.393
brought some money to class.
So Player I will have a choice,

00:00:24.393 --> 00:00:29.750
Player I can put nothing,
$1 or $3 into a hat.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.841
The hat will then be given to
Player II and Player II can look

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:40.350
at what's in the hat and either
she can match what's in the hat,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.402
i.e., add the same amount in so
1 if it's 1, or 3 if it's 3,

00:00:46.402 --> 00:00:49.890
or she can simply take the
cash.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.370
The payoffs of this game will
be as follows.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.826
Player I, if they put nothing
in, they're not going to get

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:57.248
anything.
If they put 1 in and it's

00:00:57.248 --> 00:01:01.770
matched then they double their
money, so they get 2 back.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.016
If they put 3 in and it's
matched then they double their

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:09.489
money, so they get 6 back so
they'll net 3.

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:14.078
However, if they put 1 in and
Player II takes it they've just

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:17.367
lost their dollar,
and if they put $3 in and

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.350
Player II takes it they've lost
$3.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.310
Everyone understand that?
Pretty simple.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.941
From Player II's point of view,
if Player II matches then they

00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:32.925
get their investment back plus
$1.50 if they matched 1,

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:38.503
so the get 2.50 back in all;
and they get their investment

00:01:38.503 --> 00:01:43.660
back plus $2 if they match 3,
so they get 5 back in all.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.401
Of course, if they simply take
the money out of the hat and put

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.010
it in their pocket then that's
what they get in the game.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.940
So once again,
if Player II matches with $1,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.096
there's $1 in the hat and she
matches, then she gets back 2.50

00:01:56.096 --> 00:02:00.011
for a profit of 1.50.
If there's $3 and she matches

00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:02.909
3, she gets back 5 for a profit
of 2;

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.783
and if she simply takes the
money out of the hat and puts it

00:02:06.783 --> 00:02:11.050
in her pocket then she gets how
ever much money was in the hat.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.738
So I here will be the provider
of the hat, we'll use the same

00:02:15.738 --> 00:02:18.746
hat we used before,
and if necessary I'll provide

00:02:18.746 --> 00:02:20.536
sheets of paper,
we can write IOU's on,

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:22.610
but I'm hoping we can play for
real cash.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.000
Later on--it would be nice to
get a chair here--but for now,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.390
let me just go down here and
I'm going to grab this mike.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.536
Who here wants to be Player I?
Who brought some money to class

00:02:34.536 --> 00:02:36.332
today?
I'm quite willing to pick on

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:37.865
somebody.
All right good,

00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:40.600
so Player I is,
what's your name again?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.622
Student: Justin.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:02:41.622 --> 00:02:43.772
Justin.
So hold onto that hat for a

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:46.620
second and who wants to be
Player II?

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.360
All right, so this gentleman
here whose name is?

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.677
Student: Nate.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.363
Nate.
All right so we have Justin and

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:53.048
Nate.
So Justin you have to decide

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:55.379
how much money you're going to
put in the hat.

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.970
Did you bring some money too
Nate?

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.811
Better make sure you have,
otherwise borrow some from your

00:02:59.811 --> 00:03:01.256
neighbors.
Student: I'm going to

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:03.895
put in a buck.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:03:03.895 --> 00:03:07.985
right, so the money's being put
in the hat and delivered to

00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:09.368
Nate.
Student: I'm going to

00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:10.479
put in a buck too so that I get
2.50.

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:12.397
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so if we empty out the

00:03:12.397 --> 00:03:13.580
hat, here's our beautiful pink
hat.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.764
I should really have the hat
passed across the room rather

00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:18.479
than have me do it,
but we have $2 in the hat so

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:22.502
I'm going to pay each - I'm
going to pay--what am I going to

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:25.121
pay?
I'm going to pay Player I $2,

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.404
I'm going to give them back
their original $1 and give them

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:32.727
$2 in a second,
and I'm going to pay Player II

00:03:32.727 --> 00:03:34.710
$1.50.
Just hold the hat.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.667
Student: $2.50.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:42.550
$2.50, you got your money back.
Trying to cheat me is that it?

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.500
So Player, I'll get you the
rest in a second,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.919
hang on a second for now,
so we double the money.

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.384
So one reason to take this
class is, if you play well,

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:54.691
you get money.
All right, now let's just play

00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.300
again, so we had one round of
this, let's have another round.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.440
Who wants to be Player I now?
All right, so Katie is Player I.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.349
Katie did you bring some money?
Student: Yeah, sure.

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.687
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, and who wants to be

00:04:06.687 --> 00:04:08.158
Player II?
Someone further away,

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:10.150
let's have, Steven isn't it?
Is that right.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.402
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:13.030
Steven's going to be Player II.
Did you bring some cash?

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.256
Student: I think so.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:17.297
right, otherwise borrow it from
your neighbors,

00:04:17.297 --> 00:04:21.350
I have IOU's here.
So here's the hat.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:27.180
You've got coins great,
so pass the hat down.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.379
Let's see if it makes it there,
test the honesty of the class

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:33.167
here.
It's working its way down,

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:34.813
I'm going to have to,
there we go,

00:04:34.813 --> 00:04:38.790
all the way down to Steven.
Check how much is in there.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.629
Student: There's a
dollar in here.

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:40.810
Professor Ben Polak:
There's a dollar there so you

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.589
can decide whether to match or
not.

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:42.610
Student: Okay,
I'll match it.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.693
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so Steven's going to

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:49.392
match as well.
Once again, we have this time,

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:51.645
rather annoyingly $1 and some
coins in here,

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:54.685
which I will empty on the stage
to prove to everybody and I

00:04:54.685 --> 00:04:57.986
will--all right there are coins
in here--so I'll match this in a

00:04:57.986 --> 00:05:00.240
second and give it back to you
guys.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.716
So everyone understand the game?
Everyone understand how this

00:05:03.716 --> 00:05:05.907
game works?
So we're going to spend a while

00:05:05.907 --> 00:05:08.530
discussing this.
We'd go on playing except I'd

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.991
eventually lose so much money
I'm going to run out of lunch

00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:14.199
money and the T.A.'s would
object.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.079
All right, so what I want to do
is I want to analyze this game.

00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:20.790
I want to think about what this
game's about,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.633
what's really going on here.
So first this is just a little

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:26.560
game involving putting some
money in a hat.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.691
What I want to suggest to you,
that this is a toy version of a

00:05:30.691 --> 00:05:34.889
much more important game.
This is a toy version of a game

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.092
involving a lender and a
borrower, so you could think of

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:43.600
our Player I's--that was Katie
on the second round and is it

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.139
Justin on the first round,
Justin on the first round.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.120
Imagine them working in an
investment bank,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.100
or perhaps in a venture
capitalist firm,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.905
and what they're doing is
they're giving a loan to

00:05:55.905 --> 00:05:58.939
somebody, some budding
entrepreneur who's come up with

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.868
a new project.
So Steven in Round 2 and who

00:06:01.868 --> 00:06:04.580
was my budding entrepreneur in
Round 1?

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.410
What was your name?
Student: Nate.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.033
Professor Ben Polak:
Nate in Round 1 have come up

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.858
with some budding project.
They've left Yale,

00:06:09.858 --> 00:06:11.689
perhaps after their junior
year.

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:14.276
They've left early because
they've got some great idea

00:06:14.276 --> 00:06:16.180
which is going to make them
millions.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.901
So either it's a new mouse trap
or a new version of Facebook or

00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:21.272
something, and they go to
the--and that's Harvard isn't

00:06:21.272 --> 00:06:22.958
it,
so something better than a new

00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:25.990
version of Facebook--and they go
to this venture capitalist firm.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.861
Maybe it's some firm in New
York or maybe it's the Yale

00:06:28.861 --> 00:06:32.086
Investment Trust or whatever,
and they explain this great

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:35.413
idea to them and they ask for
some money to invest in this

00:06:35.413 --> 00:06:38.800
firm to buy machinery and to pay
early wages and so on.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.041
The lender, the guy who works
at the venture capitalist firm,

00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:47.069
has to decide how much money to
invest in this project.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.191
After this money has been
invested in the project,

00:06:50.191 --> 00:06:52.930
the person who borrowed it
faces choices.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.278
They could go forward with
their project,

00:06:55.278 --> 00:06:58.742
work hard, spend the money on
the things they're supposed to

00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:02.238
spend,
or they could just disappear to

00:07:02.238 --> 00:07:06.459
Mexico (or go back to Yale for
that matter).

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.854
There's actually something in
between they could do which is

00:07:08.854 --> 00:07:10.639
less dramatic than disappearing
to Mexico,

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.223
they could just not work
particularly hard,

00:07:13.223 --> 00:07:16.976
shirk, perhaps join in someone
else's project and just let the

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:20.790
money run down without the
lender really knowing about it.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.062
So this is a very real problem
that some of you,

00:07:23.062 --> 00:07:25.432
some of the budding
entrepreneur's in the room are

00:07:25.432 --> 00:07:27.269
going to face when you leave
Yale,

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:29.264
and more of you,
who are going to end up working

00:07:29.264 --> 00:07:31.260
for investment bank's,
perhaps unfortunately,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.887
are going to face as well.
Okay so we're going to spend

00:07:35.887 --> 00:07:38.802
the whole of today analyzing
this, but before we even start

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:41.567
let's notice that there's
something different about this

00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.889
game,
other than its sheer triviality.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:47.346
There's something different
about this game than games we've

00:07:47.346 --> 00:07:50.100
played all the way up to the
mid-term so far.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.440
What's different about this
game?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:57.779
Can I get a mike in here?
Yes what's different?

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:59.050
Student: Moves aren't
simultaneous.

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.940
Professor Ben Polak: The
moves are not simultaneous.

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:07.021
This is a sequential move game.
Put the rules up here and bring

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:14.443
this down, so for the first time
we're looking at a sequential

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:21.378
move game and we're going to
spend most of the rest of the

00:08:21.378 --> 00:08:26.610
term looking at sequential move
games,

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.628
or at least looking at games
that involve sequential

00:08:29.628 --> 00:08:31.105
elements.
Now what's really,

00:08:31.105 --> 00:08:32.940
what makes this a sequential
move game?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.528
Let's be careful about this.
What makes it a sequential move

00:08:36.528 --> 00:08:41.077
game is not simply that Player I
moved first and Player II moved

00:08:41.077 --> 00:08:43.532
second,
although that's true,

00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:47.740
what really made this a
sequential move game is that

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:52.855
Player II knew what Player I had
done before he got to make his

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:55.855
move.
It isn't the timing per se that

00:08:55.855 --> 00:08:59.995
matters, it's going to turn out
it's the fact that Player II

00:08:59.995 --> 00:09:04.415
could observe Player I's choice
before having to make his or her

00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:08.352
choice that matters.
Notice, just while we're on the

00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:12.646
subject, more than that Player I
knew this was going to be the

00:09:12.646 --> 00:09:16.820
case.
So let's just get that down.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:27.692
So in this game Player II knows
Player I's choice before she

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:38.750
chooses--she being Player II,
let's say before II chooses.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:45.694
Second, Player I knows that
this will be the case,

00:09:45.694 --> 00:09:53.913
and the way we dramatized this
just now is Player I put the

00:09:53.913 --> 00:09:58.524
money in the hat,
the hat was transported across

00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:01.848
the classroom with people very
honestly not stealing the money

00:10:01.848 --> 00:10:04.431
to Player II,
Player II could look in the

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:07.093
hat, could see how much money
was in there,

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:10.200
before Steven or Nate had to
make that choice.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:14.619
Is that right?
So how do we go about analyzing

00:10:14.619 --> 00:10:17.379
games that have this sequential
structure?

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:20.324
So it turns out that a useful
way to analyze them,

00:10:20.324 --> 00:10:23.328
and the way I want to get us
used to today already,

00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:26.020
is to draw a tree.
So in the first half of the

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:29.269
class we drew a lot of matrices,
now we're going to draw trees.

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:31.292
For those people who haven't
seen trees before,

00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:33.492
not a big deal.
It's an object that looks like

00:10:33.492 --> 00:10:35.379
a tree, that's why it's called a
tree.

00:10:35.379 --> 00:10:39.077
So let's have a look,
so in this particular game,

00:10:39.077 --> 00:10:43.622
here is Player I making her
choice and in fact she has three

00:10:43.622 --> 00:10:48.342
possible choices.
She can put nothing,

00:10:48.342 --> 00:10:53.316
1 or 3 into the hat.
Player II then chooses,

00:10:53.316 --> 00:10:57.794
although really Player II only
has choices to make if there's

00:10:57.794 --> 00:11:02.211
some money in the hat,
and Player II has two choices

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:05.730
in this particular game in
either case.

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:11.283
Either Player II is going to
add $1 or $3 into the hat or

00:11:11.283 --> 00:11:17.431
they're going to disappear off
to Mexico, taking our investors'

00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:21.009
lunch money with them.
Let's put down the payoffs.

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:24.860
So let's put down as payoffs,
the net gains they make.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:29.193
So if nothing goes in,
no one makes any money so (0,0)

00:11:29.193 --> 00:11:33.751
will be the payoff.
If 1 is matched by 1 then the

00:11:33.751 --> 00:11:39.926
investor, the lender doubles her
money so she makes a net profit

00:11:39.926 --> 00:11:43.440
of 1.
If the money is taken out by

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:48.666
Player II then she loses 1.
Down here if II matches her

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:54.397
investment of 3 she doubles her
money again, so she makes a net

00:11:54.397 --> 00:11:59.760
profit of 3, and if the money is
taken out she loses 3.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.000
Everyone all right with that?
Let's do Player II's payoffs.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.009
In the case in which he matches
1 he makes a net profit of 1.50.

00:12:11.009 --> 00:12:14.852
In the case in which he just
steals the 1 he makes a net

00:12:14.852 --> 00:12:16.677
profit of 1.
And down here,

00:12:16.677 --> 00:12:20.311
in the case where he matches 3
he makes a net profit of 2--he

00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:23.460
gets 5 back but he'd invested 3
to start with --,

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:30.305
and here if he just takes the
money out he makes a profit of

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:31.971
3.
So this game is just

00:12:31.971 --> 00:12:35.336
illustrated on the board,
and for some of you this is the

00:12:35.336 --> 00:12:38.981
first time you've seen a tree,
but I'm going to claim it isn't

00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:42.035
such a complicated object and we
could spend a lot of time

00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:45.090
analyzing this in terms of
connected graphs and so on,

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.360
but it isn't really worth it:
it's just a tree.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.447
Okay, so let's just make sure
we understand that the payoffs

00:12:53.447 --> 00:12:58.104
here represent Player I's payoff
and Player II's payoff

00:12:58.104 --> 00:13:01.924
respectively.
So how do we analyze what to do

00:13:01.924 --> 00:13:04.206
in these games?
It's a good idea always to

00:13:04.206 --> 00:13:06.501
write out the tree like it's a
good idea to write out the

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:08.470
matrix, but how to analyze what
we should do?

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:12.489
Well before we do that,
let me just grab the mike and

00:13:12.489 --> 00:13:16.200
find out from our players what
they should do.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:22.181
So where was my first investor?
So Justin why did you put $1 in

00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.893
there?
Student: Well if I put

00:13:23.893 --> 00:13:25.809
$1 in then he has an incentive
to put $1 in too.

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:28.100
If I put in $3 he's just going
to take the money and run.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.000
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so what's Justin doing?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.889
Justin is looking forward,
if you like.

00:13:32.889 --> 00:13:35.020
He's putting himself in Player
II's shoes.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.009
Who was our receiver?
Nate.

00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:41.730
Nate's shoes and anticipating
what Nate's going to do.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.258
And, as Justin said,
if he puts in 3 Nate's going to

00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.539
have an incentive to take the
money and run.

00:13:46.539 --> 00:13:48.509
In fact, what would Nate have
done?

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:51.169
If 3 had been in the hat what
would you have done?

00:13:51.169 --> 00:13:52.828
Student: I like Justin
but I would have taken the

00:13:52.828 --> 00:13:54.007
money.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:55.791
right, even though you know
Justin, you would have taken the

00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.279
money and disappeared somewhere,
we don't quite know right?

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:00.100
Is the same true for the other
player?

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.353
So Katie, you also put 1 in,
is that your explanation as

00:14:02.353 --> 00:14:03.230
well?
Student: Same reasoning.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.958
Professor Ben Polak:
Same reasoning,

00:14:03.958 --> 00:14:05.414
okay.
So everyone figured out what

00:14:05.414 --> 00:14:06.749
was going on,
and once again,

00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:08.894
we think probably,
let's try, Steven if it had

00:14:08.894 --> 00:14:11.230
been $3 in the hat what would
you have done?

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.580
Student: I would have
taken it.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:12.940
Professor Ben Polak:
Taken it, all right.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:19.043
So we're basically getting
what's predicted here out of the

00:14:19.043 --> 00:14:21.065
game.
Let's just see that more

00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:23.813
formally, that idea.
So the idea here is that the

00:14:23.813 --> 00:14:27.409
players who move early on in the
game should do something we've

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.925
always talked about before.
They should put themselves in

00:14:30.925 --> 00:14:34.720
the shoes of the other players,
but here that takes the form of

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.801
anticipation.
They're anticipating what

00:14:37.801 --> 00:14:41.080
players down the tree are going
to do.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.480
So the key idea here is
anticipation.

00:14:49.179 --> 00:14:52.368
What they're going to do is
they're going to look forward

00:14:52.368 --> 00:14:55.075
down the tree;
imagine themselves in the shoes

00:14:55.075 --> 00:14:58.507
of the later players;
look at the incentives facing

00:14:58.507 --> 00:15:01.323
those later players;
imagine that they do the best

00:15:01.323 --> 00:15:03.700
they can--those later players do
the best they can --;

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.820
and then walk backwards through
the tree.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:16.267
So the key idea here is to look
forward to the end of the tree

00:15:16.267 --> 00:15:22.360
and work back:
look forward and work back.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:28.016
That's exactly the process that
Katie and Justin described

00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:30.936
themselves as doing.
Now in this tree,

00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:34.274
let's have a go at this.
So let's imagine ourselves in

00:15:34.274 --> 00:15:38.240
Steven or Nate's shoes,
having found--as they did in

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:41.039
fact--having found $1 in the
hat.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:46.148
They then are making a choice
between adding $1 which nets

00:15:46.148 --> 00:15:50.720
them a $1.50 or taking the $1
which nets them $1.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.272
1.50 is bigger than 1,
so we think they're going to go

00:15:54.272 --> 00:15:56.529
this way.
Everyone happy with that?

00:15:56.529 --> 00:16:00.934
Conversely, if they found
themselves with $3 in the hat

00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:05.666
then, if they add $3 --they
match--they're going to get $2,

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:09.768
they're going to net $2;
and if they take the money out

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:11.889
they're going to get away with
$3.

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:15.572
3 seems bigger than 2 so we
think they're going to go this

00:16:15.572 --> 00:16:17.728
way.
Again, we're assuming that

00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:21.728
these are their real payoffs.
Okay, so from Player I's point

00:16:21.728 --> 00:16:25.644
of view, since Player I knows
that Player II will observe the

00:16:25.644 --> 00:16:28.190
choice before making her own
choice,

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:32.026
and since Player I can put him
or herself in Player II's shoes

00:16:32.026 --> 00:16:35.284
and anticipate this choice,
Player I is essentially

00:16:35.284 --> 00:16:39.040
choosing between what?
If she puts in 0 she gets 0,

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.095
if she puts in 1 she knows II
will match and she'll double her

00:16:44.095 --> 00:16:47.125
money and get 1,
and if she puts in 3,

00:16:47.125 --> 00:16:50.870
then she knows Player II will
take the money and run,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.120
in which case our lender will
have lost $3.

00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:59.576
So she's choosing between 0,1
and -3 and she's going to choose

00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:03.960
$1, which is exactly what
happened in the game.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.400
Everyone happy with how we did
that?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.619
So this idea of starting at the
last player, the player who

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.474
moves last, solving out what
they're going to and then

00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:18.329
working our way back through the
tree has a name.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:20.510
The name for this is "backward
induction."

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.090
I apologize for the
business-school students in the

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.548
room who have had this hammered
into them too many times already

00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.070
so I apologize for them in
advance.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.052
Backward induction.
Now it turns out there's

00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:41.210
precisely one controversial
thing about backward induction,

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:45.114
which is whether you should say
backward induction or backwards

00:17:45.114 --> 00:17:47.867
induction.
So I'm going to leave the "s"

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:51.517
off and call it backward
induction, but it's up to you

00:17:51.517 --> 00:17:54.410
which you think the correct
English is.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:18:00.664
Okay, so since we've got this
game here let's talk about it a

00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:02.844
bit.
This idea of the lender and the

00:18:02.844 --> 00:18:05.099
borrower--it's not an
unimportant situation.

00:18:05.099 --> 00:18:08.474
We've simplified it down to a
very simple choice here,

00:18:08.474 --> 00:18:12.230
but it's a very basic choice
out there in the real world.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:14.745
It's an important choice,
after all, what keeps the

00:18:14.745 --> 00:18:17.613
economy running is the ability
of lenders to lend money to

00:18:17.613 --> 00:18:20.180
businesses that then invest them
profitability,

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.637
and are able to make returns.
So this underlies a whole bunch

00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:28.089
of stuff going on in the
economy.

00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:31.088
So let's talk about this and
the first thing I want to talk

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:34.190
about is, I want to point out
that there's a problem here.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:37.767
There's a bad thing here,
much like there was a bad thing

00:18:37.767 --> 00:18:40.450
in the very first class of the
semester.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.366
In the very first class of the
semester the bad thing was a

00:18:43.366 --> 00:18:45.427
Prisoner's Dilemma,
but here it's a little

00:18:45.427 --> 00:18:47.640
different but let's focus on it
a while.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:51.400
So the bad thing is we ended up
here.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.970
Not a disaster:
the lender doubled her money.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.013
The borrower was able to go
ahead with the project on a

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:02.814
small scale and make some money.
The bad thing,

00:19:02.814 --> 00:19:09.950
however, is that we would have
liked to end up here.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:15.010
Had we been able to have a
large project funded with $3 and

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.500
had the borrower repaid those
dollars,

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.624
so matched in effort or
whatever that happens to be,

00:19:21.624 --> 00:19:25.299
then we'd have ended up at an
outcome that is better not just

00:19:25.299 --> 00:19:29.036
for the lender--it's obviously
better for the lender--but it's

00:19:29.036 --> 00:19:33.059
also better for the borrower.
Does everyone see that?

00:19:33.059 --> 00:19:36.947
So the outcome we would like to
have reached gets the lender 3

00:19:36.947 --> 00:19:40.069
whereas she's only getting 1
where we ended up,

00:19:40.069 --> 00:19:45.334
and it gets the borrow 2 where
he's only getting 1.50 where we

00:19:45.334 --> 00:19:50.464
actually ended up.
Why is it that we were unable

00:19:50.464 --> 00:19:55.982
through both of our pairs,
both Justin and Nate,

00:19:55.982 --> 00:20:02.910
and Katie and Steven--why were
we unable to get to here?

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:05.795
Any takers?
What got us,

00:20:05.795 --> 00:20:11.150
what prevents us from getting
to this good outcome?

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.596
Let's go back to Katie a second
and see if we can,

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:20.250
go ahead.
I'll come it's all right.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.630
So Katie was saying why she
invested 1.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.642
I picked on Justin before,
so here's this good outcome,

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:28.332
it's better for you,
it's better for Steven who's

00:20:28.332 --> 00:20:30.578
your borrower,
why aren't we getting to this

00:20:30.578 --> 00:20:32.240
3,
2 outcome?

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:36.707
Student: Because if I
play 3, him matching my money is

00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:41.076
dominated, strictly dominated.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:44.921
right, so the problem here is
Katie would like to invest 3 if

00:20:44.921 --> 00:20:48.190
she knew that in fact Steven was
going to match,

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.059
but she knows Steven's not
going to match.

00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:53.898
Steven, in fact,
is going to run off with the

00:20:53.898 --> 00:20:56.053
cash.
It's going to end up being

00:20:56.053 --> 00:20:58.279
spent at Starbuck's or
something.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:02.366
From Steven's point of view he
would actually like to be able

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:05.702
to borrow the $3.
He would like to be able to end

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:09.444
up at this 3,2 outcome as well.
The problem is he knows that

00:21:09.444 --> 00:21:11.895
Katie knows, and Katie knows
that he knows,

00:21:11.895 --> 00:21:14.930
that in fact he's going to run
off with the cash.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.846
Is that right?
So we're in a bit of a problem

00:21:18.846 --> 00:21:21.077
here.
We'd like to get this good

00:21:21.077 --> 00:21:25.171
outcome but incentives are
preventing us from getting

00:21:25.171 --> 00:21:27.559
there.
What do we call this kind of

00:21:27.559 --> 00:21:30.997
situation?
What do we call this kind of

00:21:30.997 --> 00:21:34.340
problem?
Anybody?

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.300
No takers?
This is called "moral hazard."

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.690
How many of you have heard the
term moral hazard before?

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.039
A number of people have heard
of it.

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.910
So moral hazard here is the
problem.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:00.266
That the agent,
in this case the borrower has

00:22:00.266 --> 00:22:05.215
incentives--will have
incentives--to do things that

00:22:05.215 --> 00:22:09.769
are not in the interests of the
principal.

00:22:09.769 --> 00:22:11.816
If we're not careful,
for example,

00:22:11.816 --> 00:22:15.227
by giving too big a loan,
the incentives of the borrower

00:22:15.227 --> 00:22:18.886
will be such that they will
actually not be aligned with the

00:22:18.886 --> 00:22:22.421
incentives of the lender and
that will prove to be bad for

00:22:22.421 --> 00:22:25.422
the lender.
But notice the existence of

00:22:25.422 --> 00:22:29.269
this moral hazard problem isn't
only bad for the lender.

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:33.440
It ends up being bad for the
borrower as well.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.493
Let me give you another
example, in insurance there's a

00:22:36.493 --> 00:22:39.490
classic, probably the classic
moral-hazard problem.

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:43.950
If an insurance company insures
me against having my car stolen,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:47.420
there's a moral hazard problem
in that I might,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.504
if the car is fully insured,
I might now have the incentive

00:22:51.504 --> 00:22:55.589
not to bother to lock my car or
to leave it anywhere on the

00:22:55.589 --> 00:22:59.554
street in New Haven,
because I'm not bearing the

00:22:59.554 --> 00:23:01.525
cost.
So we need to be able to--the

00:23:01.525 --> 00:23:04.354
insurance company needs to worry
about that in writing an

00:23:04.354 --> 00:23:07.375
insurance contract for me.
And in practice what the

00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:11.329
insurance company does is it
forces me to take a deductible.

00:23:11.329 --> 00:23:13.349
It doesn't allow me full
insurance.

00:23:13.349 --> 00:23:17.813
It makes sure that some of the
cost of having a car stolen is

00:23:17.813 --> 00:23:21.413
going to fall on me.
That's bad for me by the way

00:23:21.413 --> 00:23:24.569
because it means I can't get
full insurance.

00:23:24.569 --> 00:23:27.099
And notice that what happened
here is rather similar.

00:23:27.099 --> 00:23:29.755
In this case,
both the lender and the

00:23:29.755 --> 00:23:33.591
borrower would rather have a big
project, a big loan,

00:23:33.591 --> 00:23:36.690
and have the agent pay back
that loan.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.104
They'd prefer this (3,2)
outcome, but they can't get

00:23:40.104 --> 00:23:42.502
there.
And therefore rather than

00:23:42.502 --> 00:23:46.674
having a full scale project,
Katie or Justin only offered

00:23:46.674 --> 00:23:49.579
the borrowers a small scale
project.

00:23:49.579 --> 00:23:58.604
So the idea here in this
example was--what happened was

00:23:58.604 --> 00:24:09.132
we kept the size of the project
or the size of the loan--you can

00:24:09.132 --> 00:24:17.154
think of this as the project if
they're borrowing

00:24:17.154 --> 00:24:26.680
something--small to reduce the
temptation to cheat,

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.839
to reduce the temptation not to
repay the loan.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:36.727
So these problems are all over
society but they're particularly

00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:41.299
prevalent in situations
involving lenders and borrowers.

00:24:41.299 --> 00:24:46.900
So a good question is how might
we solve this problem?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.181
A lot of you are about to go
out and try and borrow money to

00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:50.883
set up your projects,
run your new version of

00:24:50.883 --> 00:24:53.162
Facebook or whatever.
And a lot more of you as we

00:24:53.162 --> 00:24:55.398
said before, are going to end up
loaning money,

00:24:55.398 --> 00:24:58.460
perhaps someone else's money
probably, at least for a while.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:02.396
And we want to know how you
might solve this moral hazard

00:25:02.396 --> 00:25:04.440
problem.
We've seen one way to solve it.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.450
One way is for me to keep the
size of the project small.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:12.454
What else could we do?
Let me come down and try and

00:25:12.454 --> 00:25:15.690
have a bit of a discussion.
What else could we do?

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.263
Steven what else could we do?
You were the borrower,

00:25:17.263 --> 00:25:19.470
what else could you do?
Student: Impose laws.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.660
Professor Ben Polak: We
could impose laws.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.472
Okay, so we could impose laws
much like we tried in the

00:25:23.472 --> 00:25:26.180
Prisoner's Dilemma,
we could regulate this market.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:29.335
There's going to be a little
bit of a problem we're going to

00:25:29.335 --> 00:25:32.329
run into in regulating the law,
in using the law here.

00:25:32.329 --> 00:25:34.700
What's the problem we're going
to run into here?

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.579
We do have laws that regulate
borrowers and lenders.

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:41.742
What's the law that regulates
borrowers and lenders:

00:25:41.742 --> 00:25:45.793
bankruptcy law right?
So we have law that regulates

00:25:45.793 --> 00:25:49.539
to some extent what lenders and
borrowers can do.

00:25:49.539 --> 00:25:52.533
One of the things that we do in
that law is we limit the degree

00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:54.900
to which we're allowed to punish
the borrowers.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:58.269
So bankruptcy law pretty much
says we're going to put some

00:25:58.269 --> 00:26:01.402
limit on how much Katie can
inflict pain on Steven for

00:26:01.402 --> 00:26:03.589
running off with the lunch
money.

00:26:03.589 --> 00:26:06.406
Steven can simply say I can't
repay, I'm bankrupt,

00:26:06.406 --> 00:26:09.509
and he's more or less allowed
to have a fresh start.

00:26:09.509 --> 00:26:12.609
So the law would be good here
but there's limits to what we

00:26:12.609 --> 00:26:14.292
can do.
We could go back to the

00:26:14.292 --> 00:26:17.376
Dickensian world of throwing
Steven in jail for not repaying

00:26:17.376 --> 00:26:21.076
the loan, but it's tough.
There are down sides to that it

00:26:21.076 --> 00:26:24.140
turns out.
So what else could we do?

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.602
Yeah, I'm going to have to dive
in there, so shout into the

00:26:27.602 --> 00:26:29.289
mike.
Student: Venture

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:32.270
capitalist's can impose
restrictions on what the person

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.911
can do with the money.
Professor Ben Polak: So

00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:37.392
you could try and say there's
only certain things you can do

00:26:37.392 --> 00:26:38.941
with the money.
And, for example,

00:26:38.941 --> 00:26:41.407
to make that credible,
what you might have to do is to

00:26:41.407 --> 00:26:43.780
say: show me what you're going
to do with the money,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.907
show me the receipts.
Or another thing you could say

00:26:46.907 --> 00:26:50.742
is, I will only give you the
money if you show me exactly how

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:54.119
you're going to spend this.
That's a good solution.

00:26:54.119 --> 00:26:59.187
Notice that you could regard
that as changing the order of

00:26:59.187 --> 00:27:01.279
play.
It's a little bit like saying,

00:27:01.279 --> 00:27:04.072
let's have the borrower have to
move first, let's have the

00:27:04.072 --> 00:27:07.109
borrower have to commit what
their actions are going to be,

00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:11.170
how they're going to spend the
money before--you know--show the

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.509
contracts before the lender
lends them the money.

00:27:14.509 --> 00:27:17.380
That's a good solution,
but again there are limitations

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.217
to this solution.
What are the limitations to

00:27:20.217 --> 00:27:23.703
that solution in the real world?
Let's go back to all of you who

00:27:23.703 --> 00:27:26.089
are thinking about making
millions with your new Facebook,

00:27:26.089 --> 00:27:30.672
what are the limitations to
having some contracts with the

00:27:30.672 --> 00:27:33.515
bank, with Chase,
saying exactly how you're going

00:27:33.515 --> 00:27:35.721
to--not only is it saying
exactly how you're going to

00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:37.969
spend the money but actually
detailing it already with

00:27:37.969 --> 00:27:42.460
contracts ahead of time.
What are the problems with that?

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.029
Someone else who's thinking of
going into business here--let me

00:27:45.029 --> 00:27:48.180
pick on somebody a second.
So what's your name sir?

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.849
Student: Kelly
Professor Ben Polak:

00:27:49.849 --> 00:27:51.309
Kelly, so imagine you have some
project,

00:27:51.309 --> 00:27:53.809
you're going to borrow some
money from Chase or Mr.

00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:57.140
Swenson to set up this fund,
why might you worry about

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.460
having everything written out
contractually ahead of time?

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.076
Student: I mean then it
restricts your freedom on what

00:28:04.076 --> 00:28:05.210
your ideas are,
I guess.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.396
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so one problem is just

00:28:07.396 --> 00:28:09.279
sheer lack of flexibility.
If, in fact,

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:12.897
the entrepreneur is not going
to be flexible on how they

00:28:12.897 --> 00:28:16.003
actually run the project,
there's not much point of being

00:28:16.003 --> 00:28:17.470
an entrepreneur in the first
place.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:20.041
There's a limit to how much
control you want to give to the

00:28:20.041 --> 00:28:22.108
lender.
The lenders don't really want

00:28:22.108 --> 00:28:24.829
to run the project for you.
There's also a severe problem

00:28:24.829 --> 00:28:26.828
of timing.
It's simply not going to be

00:28:26.828 --> 00:28:30.043
possible to specify all the
expenditures of a project up

00:28:30.043 --> 00:28:32.841
front.
You're going to need some money

00:28:32.841 --> 00:28:36.602
to do some things ahead of time.
So it's a good idea--changing

00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:39.195
the order of play is a good
idea--but there's going to be

00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:42.501
limitations to this.
What else could you do as the

00:28:42.501 --> 00:28:46.660
lender?
What else could you do?

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.924
Thinking of loaning some money
in here, loaning some money to

00:28:49.924 --> 00:28:52.210
one of your classmates for some
project.

00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:54.093
Let's try here.
Student: Something like

00:28:54.093 --> 00:28:56.130
loan money over time in stages
and observe progress.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.977
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so one possibility is to

00:28:59.977 --> 00:29:03.352
break the loan up and give
it--let it come in small

00:29:03.352 --> 00:29:06.164
installments.
If you do well on the first

00:29:06.164 --> 00:29:09.740
installment I'll give you a
bigger installment next time.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.201
Notice that that's a little bit
like something we talked about

00:29:12.201 --> 00:29:15.031
in the very first week.
It's a little bit like taking

00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:18.549
this one shot game and turning
it into a repeated game.

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:21.839
It's turning a one shot
interaction into a repeated

00:29:21.839 --> 00:29:23.948
interaction.
We'll come back and talk about

00:29:23.948 --> 00:29:25.769
repeated interactions later on
in the course.

00:29:25.769 --> 00:29:28.819
Again, notice that there might
be some limitations to this.

00:29:28.819 --> 00:29:31.178
I mean I think it's a good
idea, and in general you should

00:29:31.178 --> 00:29:33.450
be trying to do this,
but it could just be that the

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.183
set up--for Nate to set up his
new Facebook and for Steven to

00:29:36.183 --> 00:29:38.688
set up his new mousetrap
factory--they just need a chunk

00:29:38.688 --> 00:29:41.583
of money at the beginning.
There may be some limit to how

00:29:41.583 --> 00:29:44.650
little money you can give them
at the beginning since they have

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.844
to hire workers,
and set up the factory,

00:29:46.844 --> 00:29:49.899
and make some big splash in
advertising, and so on and so

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.224
forth.
So again, it's a good idea but

00:29:52.224 --> 00:29:54.890
there may be limitations here.
What else could you do?

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.150
Let's have a look at the
numbers on the board.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.472
Right now, the numbers on the
board say that if Steven's

00:30:00.472 --> 00:30:04.157
mousetrap project--were you the
Facebook or the mousetrap?--if

00:30:04.157 --> 00:30:07.902
Steven's mousetrap project goes
well and it ends up being a big

00:30:07.902 --> 00:30:10.500
project with lots of money
available.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.522
There are five units of money
available in profit,

00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:18.342
3 plus 2.
The way we've designed things

00:30:18.342 --> 00:30:21.843
so far, our lender--I gave you
these payoffs in the game--the

00:30:21.843 --> 00:30:24.119
lender is going to double her
money.

00:30:24.119 --> 00:30:27.969
She's going to get 6 back to
net 3 and Steven's going to get

00:30:27.969 --> 00:30:31.602
2.
So the division of that 5 is 3

00:30:31.602 --> 00:30:33.642
and 2.
But we don't have to divide the

00:30:33.642 --> 00:30:36.419
money like that.
If you're a lender you may want

00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:40.328
to think about how you divide up
the spoils of a successful

00:30:40.328 --> 00:30:43.286
project.
So how else could you divide up

00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:47.074
those $5, that 3 plus 2,
in a way that might be better

00:30:47.074 --> 00:30:49.759
for everybody?
Nate?

00:30:49.759 --> 00:30:52.518
Student: Give the
investor $3.01 if they do that

00:30:52.518 --> 00:30:55.583
other choice and then take a
little bit of a hit but that way

00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:58.393
you'll still have something
that's pretty optimal to the

00:30:58.393 --> 00:31:00.589
other choices that we came to
before.

00:31:00.589 --> 00:31:02.065
Professor Ben Polak: I'm
guessing you all didn't hear

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:03.290
that but that was right,
so let me just say it.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:06.252
That's exactly right.
So what you could do here is

00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:10.650
you could redesign the payoffs
of this project in the event

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.776
that it's successful.
What you could do is take these

00:31:14.776 --> 00:31:19.390
5 units of profit and instead of
having (3,2)--let's write that

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:23.259
in a different color--we could
give the borrower,

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:32.869
the entrepreneur 3.1,
leaving 1.9 to the lender.

00:31:32.869 --> 00:31:37.584
All right, so we could change
the payoffs of this contract to

00:31:37.584 --> 00:31:41.120
be (1.9,3.1) in the event of a
big project.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.202
Why does that help?
Because now our borrower,

00:31:45.202 --> 00:31:49.562
Nate or Steven,
were they to end up with a hat

00:31:49.562 --> 00:31:55.084
with $3 in it,
they now will find it in their

00:31:55.084 --> 00:32:01.800
interest to match the $3 and get
3.1 rather than 3.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.010
So what's this an example of?
This idea of changing the

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:12.009
contract to give the borrower
incentives to repay,

00:32:12.009 --> 00:32:14.378
incentives not to shirk,
incentives not to disappear

00:32:14.378 --> 00:32:16.421
with the cash,
is an example of what's called

00:32:16.421 --> 00:32:17.490
"incentive design."

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:30.998
So the idea here is,
in a lot of businesses,

00:32:30.998 --> 00:32:33.630
incentives are not given by
God.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.490
They're designed by the people
who write the contracts.

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:40.005
If you're either the borrower
or the lender,

00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:43.455
you should be thinking about
writing a contract that's going

00:32:43.455 --> 00:32:45.619
to achieve the end that you
want.

00:32:45.619 --> 00:32:48.881
Now notice in this particular
example, exactly as Nate said,

00:32:48.881 --> 00:32:51.589
the lender's going to take a
bit of a hit here,

00:32:51.589 --> 00:32:55.272
they're not going to get a 100%
return, but they're ending up

00:32:55.272 --> 00:32:58.647
doing better than they would
have done by giving a small

00:32:58.647 --> 00:33:03.296
loan.
They've ended up getting 1.9

00:33:03.296 --> 00:33:08.417
rather than 1,
so in this particular

00:33:08.417 --> 00:33:15.294
example--it won't always be the
case but in this

00:33:15.294 --> 00:33:24.220
example--they're taking a
smaller share of a larger pie.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:29.027
Sometimes a smaller share of a
larger pie is bigger than a

00:33:29.027 --> 00:33:33.920
larger share of a smaller pie:
not always but sometimes.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:37.829
The reason the pie is larger is
we're able now in an incentive

00:33:37.829 --> 00:33:42.059
compatible way--we're able to go
ahead and have a large project.

00:33:42.059 --> 00:33:45.079
So in this example,
the smaller share of the larger

00:33:45.079 --> 00:33:48.582
pie actually ended up being
bigger than the larger share of

00:33:48.582 --> 00:33:56.121
the smaller pie.
So a smaller share of a larger

00:33:56.121 --> 00:34:06.884
pie can be bigger than a large
share of a small pie,

00:34:06.884 --> 00:34:17.119
not always of course.
This is just an example.

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:20.099
Now let's just be a little bit
careful here.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:23.941
So in this particular example,
even though this 1.9--this

00:34:23.941 --> 00:34:28.056
return that our lender is able
to make by accepting a smaller

00:34:28.056 --> 00:34:31.898
share of a larger pie--even
though it's a bigger absolute

00:34:31.898 --> 00:34:35.300
return,
it's smaller in another sense.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.219
In what sense is it smaller?
Let's be careful here.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:40.230
We're tempted to say look it's
1.9.

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:42.980
1.9 is bigger than 1.
That's got to be a good thing.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.901
But since some of you actually
are going to go out into

00:34:44.901 --> 00:34:46.467
investment banks,
and you might be posed this

00:34:46.467 --> 00:34:48.997
question,
let me just make sure we don't

00:34:48.997 --> 00:34:52.650
make a blunder that's going to
spoil your interview.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:57.204
So what might you be worried
about as an investment banker

00:34:57.204 --> 00:35:00.320
about this deal,
about this contract?

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:04.511
Somebody else, anybody else?
I'll come down again,

00:35:04.511 --> 00:35:07.510
that's all right.
What might you be worried about?

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.632
Who here, be honest,
who here has been interviewing

00:35:10.632 --> 00:35:13.941
with either investment banks or
venture capital firms,

00:35:13.941 --> 00:35:17.349
or private equity firms?
Raise your hands.

00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:21.310
Oh come on there has got to be
more than that.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.100
There was a hand.
Where was the hand at the back?

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.670
There was a hand way back here.
No, yeah?

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:31.460
What might be wrong with this
project from your point of view?

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:36.177
Can I get the mike on that side?
This gentleman here,

00:35:36.177 --> 00:35:38.929
what might be wrong with the
project from your point of view?

00:35:38.929 --> 00:35:41.250
Student: If you could
actually just find three small

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.449
projects then you could still
get a 100% returns just by

00:35:43.449 --> 00:35:44.957
dividing it up.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:35:44.957 --> 00:35:46.645
Good, you're going to make lots
of money for Morgan Stanley or

00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:47.310
whatever it is,
good.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:50.905
Your name is?
Brian, right so it's a good ad

00:35:50.905 --> 00:35:56.621
to hire Brian at Morgan Stanley.
So what Brian said was it's

00:35:56.621 --> 00:36:02.900
true that you're making a bigger
absolute return here.

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.250
This is a bigger absolute
return.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:10.289
But this return up here is a
100% return on your capital.

00:36:10.289 --> 00:36:14.865
The rate of return on capital
is higher making a 100% return

00:36:14.865 --> 00:36:18.898
on an investment of 1,
than making a 1.9 return on an

00:36:18.898 --> 00:36:22.961
investment of 3.
The rate of return is better in

00:36:22.961 --> 00:36:26.019
the smaller case.
So which is the right answer?

00:36:26.019 --> 00:36:30.867
Should we worry about the rate
of return, the 100% rate of

00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:35.460
return or should we worry about
the absolute return?

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.699
If you're in the business of
investment banking,

00:36:37.699 --> 00:36:40.320
who thinks we should worry
about the absolute return?

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.160
Who thinks we should worry
about the rate of return?

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:50.170
Who thinks it depends?
What does it depend on?

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:52.280
(Keep me from falling off this
thing.) Wwhat does it depend on?

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.449
Somebody said it depends.
What does it depend on?

00:36:54.449 --> 00:36:56.741
Depends is only a good
compromise vote if you know what

00:36:56.741 --> 00:37:00.909
it depends on.
Yeah, the gentleman here.

00:37:00.909 --> 00:37:03.807
Student: Since an
investment banking firm only has

00:37:03.807 --> 00:37:05.670
limited amount of money to
invest,

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:08.857
you want to see if you can get
a higher rate of return

00:37:08.857 --> 00:37:11.398
investing elsewhere.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:37:11.398 --> 00:37:13.639
right, so there's two--I think
you're on the right line.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:16.665
So there's two things to worry
about, one is what is your

00:37:16.665 --> 00:37:19.852
supply of funds to invest and
the other is--what's the other

00:37:19.852 --> 00:37:23.201
supply you are worried about as
an investment banker or venture

00:37:23.201 --> 00:37:25.550
capitalist firm,
or a private equity investor?

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.969
What's the other supply coming
your way?

00:37:28.969 --> 00:37:30.780
The number of projects coming
across your door.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:37.489
The demand for your cash.
The supply of projects.

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.709
What we have to worry about
here is what is the true

00:37:41.709 --> 00:37:46.489
opportunity cost of that money?
If there were very few projects

00:37:46.489 --> 00:37:50.455
out there then you basically
just want to go down the list of

00:37:50.455 --> 00:37:53.099
projects picking off absolute
return,

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:55.977
however, you go to the other
extreme if there's an infinite

00:37:55.977 --> 00:37:57.802
supply of projects,
all coming in,

00:37:57.802 --> 00:38:01.101
all of which will offer a 100%
return, then as our banker at

00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:04.012
the back told us,
you should just go for three

00:38:04.012 --> 00:38:06.699
small projects rather than one
large one.

00:38:06.699 --> 00:38:09.360
But the question is,
which is better?

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:12.031
It isn't as simple as saying,
yes, we should always go for

00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:15.027
three small projects.
There may not be three small

00:38:15.027 --> 00:38:18.110
projects out there that offer a
100% return.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:21.466
So what's going to matter here
is what's the true opportunity

00:38:21.466 --> 00:38:24.208
cost of the capital,
and that's going to depend on

00:38:24.208 --> 00:38:26.389
what projects are available to
you.

00:38:26.389 --> 00:38:29.915
This was just an example of
incentive design,

00:38:29.915 --> 00:38:33.039
just one example of incentive
design.

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:35.949
Let's talk about other examples
of incentive design.

00:38:35.949 --> 00:38:38.150
Incentive design's been a lot
in the news lately.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:42.318
Who else tends to have
incentive contracts other than

00:38:42.318 --> 00:38:45.119
borrowers?
Who else out there tends to

00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:48.331
have incentive contracts?
It's a big topic in the news

00:38:48.331 --> 00:38:51.099
these days.
So who has incentives written

00:38:51.099 --> 00:38:53.788
into their contracts?
Way over here,

00:38:53.788 --> 00:38:57.719
let me run over at the risk of
blurring the camera.

00:38:57.719 --> 00:38:59.840
So who else has incentives in
their contracts?

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.959
Student: Managers
Professor Ben Polak:

00:39:00.959 --> 00:39:03.703
Managers all right.
So CEO's have huge incentive

00:39:03.703 --> 00:39:07.862
clauses in their contracts,
sometimes in the form of

00:39:07.862 --> 00:39:09.818
options.
Why do they have those

00:39:09.818 --> 00:39:11.599
incentive clauses in their
contract?

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.510
Well there's two
interpretations of this.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.710
One interpretation is,
it's just a bad thing and

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.630
they're just trying to screw the
world.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.909
But there's a more moderate
view of this.

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:25.152
The more moderate view of this
is that those incentive clauses

00:39:25.152 --> 00:39:28.288
in their contracts are attempts
to align the interest of the

00:39:28.288 --> 00:39:31.000
managers with the interest of
the shareholders,

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.690
just as this contract is
attempting to align the interest

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.920
of the lender and the interest
of the borrower.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.554
So by managers I took him to
mean CEOs, but what other kind

00:39:40.554 --> 00:39:42.190
of managers recently in the
press,

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.497
very recently,
this weekend,

00:39:44.497 --> 00:39:48.429
have been talking about
incentive contracts?

00:39:48.429 --> 00:39:51.590
Way over there,
I'm caught on the wrong side as

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.120
usual.
Can I squeeze through?

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.530
I'll try and squeeze through.
Can I squeeze through?

00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:01.669
Sorry.
Where was it,

00:40:01.669 --> 00:40:03.090
where was the answer to my
question?

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:04.644
Here we go.
Student: Managers of

00:40:04.644 --> 00:40:06.738
baseball teams.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:09.522
right, so managers of sports
teams also have incentive

00:40:09.522 --> 00:40:12.149
contracts these days:
incentives to achieve certain

00:40:12.149 --> 00:40:15.143
levels.
Here it's not quite clear to me

00:40:15.143 --> 00:40:18.129
exactly what's going on.
We call those incentive

00:40:18.129 --> 00:40:20.570
contracts but you might want to
worry a little bit.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:24.034
I mean do we really think that
the manager has an incentive to

00:40:24.034 --> 00:40:26.909
lose otherwise?
So part of what's going on with

00:40:26.909 --> 00:40:30.235
incentive contracts isn't
actually incentive contracts,

00:40:30.235 --> 00:40:32.699
part of it is about sharing the
risk.

00:40:32.699 --> 00:40:34.816
Particularly in the kind of
contracts that have been written

00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:36.789
about over the weekend with Joe
Torres' contract for the

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:38.288
Yankees,
which he turned down,

00:40:38.288 --> 00:40:41.190
is partly perhaps to give him
incentives to try and win,

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:44.220
but perhaps it's more to do
with sharing the risk among the

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.408
general manager and the manager
of the team if they don't make

00:40:47.408 --> 00:40:49.308
it to the playoffs.
But all right,

00:40:49.308 --> 00:40:51.954
they're still incentive
contracts and we see incentive

00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:54.401
contracts elsewhere,
and we've seen them since the

00:40:54.401 --> 00:40:56.781
Middle Ages.
So in the Middle Ages,

00:40:56.781 --> 00:40:59.704
incentive contracts took a
particular form,

00:40:59.704 --> 00:41:02.349
and the form was called two
things,

00:41:02.349 --> 00:41:16.625
piece rates and in agriculture
it took the form of share

00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:22.500
cropping.
What are piece rates?

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:27.000
Somebody, what are piece rates?
Anybody who knows what a piece

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.380
rate is?
What is share cropping?

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:32.110
Somebody must be from a farming
state.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:38.139
Somebody out here,
the guy in orange.

00:41:38.139 --> 00:41:42.383
Student: Share cropping
is where the landowner takes a

00:41:42.383 --> 00:41:46.909
portion of the farmer's crop at
the end of the farming season.

00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:50.642
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so share cropping is a

00:41:50.642 --> 00:41:54.250
contract whereby part of the
output of the farm goes to the

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:57.050
landowner and part is kept by
the farmer.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.427
Going back to the Middle Ages,
part of the output would stay

00:42:00.427 --> 00:42:03.747
with the peasant and part of it
would go to the lord of the

00:42:03.747 --> 00:42:05.690
manor.
Piece rates are a similar idea.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.765
Rather than paying wages to
workers, just bundles of cash,

00:42:09.765 --> 00:42:13.340
the amount which they're paid
depends on output.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:18.318
So piece rates would say if you
produce seventeen yards of cloth

00:42:18.318 --> 00:42:23.059
then you'll get paid the revenue
that's derived from three of

00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:26.065
those.
Both of these forms of

00:42:26.065 --> 00:42:31.199
contracting are there partly to
create incentives.

00:42:31.199 --> 00:42:35.083
They create incentives because
they create the incentive for

00:42:35.083 --> 00:42:38.901
the farmer to increase yields
and they create incentives on

00:42:38.901 --> 00:42:41.929
the part of the worker to
increase output.

00:42:41.929 --> 00:42:47.639
So piece rates are a big part
of the story.

00:42:47.639 --> 00:42:50.634
Incentive designs are a pretty
big topic and we don't really

00:42:50.634 --> 00:42:52.969
have time to go into it much in
this course.

00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:55.985
But it's worth mentioning that,
in fact, the Nobel Prize that

00:42:55.985 --> 00:42:59.101
was won last week by those three
economists we talked about was

00:42:59.101 --> 00:43:02.163
partly about incentive design.
So it's regarded as an

00:43:02.163 --> 00:43:05.485
important enough topic,
the design of incentives across

00:43:05.485 --> 00:43:09.053
society as a whole to have been
worthy of winning the Nobel

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:11.276
Prize,
and my guess is that there's

00:43:11.276 --> 00:43:14.812
another Nobel Prize that's going
to come out in this same area in

00:43:14.812 --> 00:43:18.121
the next five or ten years.
Just to make it clear,

00:43:18.121 --> 00:43:22.250
you can have problems:
you can write incentives badly.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:25.652
It's a classic story that
you've all heard of I'm sure,

00:43:25.652 --> 00:43:28.550
that often in the provision of
public goods,

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.011
let's say bridges or highways,
or tunnels, the incentives for

00:43:32.011 --> 00:43:35.530
the construction companies tend
to be rather badly written.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:38.180
They're meant to have incentive
clauses but they never seem to

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:40.268
quite get them right.
It's easy to get these

00:43:40.268 --> 00:43:42.614
incentives wrong.
Just to prove this just doesn't

00:43:42.614 --> 00:43:44.725
happen to management,
let me just tell a story

00:43:44.725 --> 00:43:46.480
against myself.
So a year ago,

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.603
a year and a bit ago,
I was picking fruit with my

00:43:49.603 --> 00:43:53.572
then three year old daughter and
I wanted to make sure that we

00:43:53.572 --> 00:43:56.369
got some fruit home to eat for
dinner,

00:43:56.369 --> 00:43:58.800
and she didn't just eat all the
fruit as we picked it.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.594
These were raspberries.
So I decided to have a rule

00:44:01.594 --> 00:44:04.390
that sounds efficient.
I said any item of fruit that

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:07.912
gets picked that's in good
condition we'll take it home for

00:44:07.912 --> 00:44:09.631
dinner,
but if it's squashed,

00:44:09.631 --> 00:44:12.543
then we'll eat it then and
there while we're picking the

00:44:12.543 --> 00:44:14.513
fruit.
So my three year old proceeded

00:44:14.513 --> 00:44:16.952
to go along the bushes of
raspberries, picking the

00:44:16.952 --> 00:44:19.370
raspberry,
turning around to me and saying

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.340
"squashed" and putting it in her
mouth: "squashed,"

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:26.477
"squashed," which shows that a
three year old knows more than a

00:44:26.477 --> 00:44:29.480
professor about moral hazard at
some level.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.748
So one thing we can do is worry
about incentive design in the

00:44:32.748 --> 00:44:35.567
design of the contract.
There's another thing we can do

00:44:35.567 --> 00:44:36.987
here.
What's the other thing we can

00:44:36.987 --> 00:44:38.889
do here?
We're missing out on something

00:44:38.889 --> 00:44:41.944
very basic.
What is it that our borrowers

00:44:41.944 --> 00:44:45.203
Steven and Nate can do?
To put it more generally,

00:44:45.203 --> 00:44:47.192
for all of you,
if you go out and start a

00:44:47.192 --> 00:44:49.941
company,
and you borrow some money to

00:44:49.941 --> 00:44:54.423
start your company when you
leave Yale, what are you going

00:44:54.423 --> 00:44:57.677
to have to do?
What's the borrower--what's the

00:44:57.677 --> 00:45:01.326
lender, what's the bank going to
insist--what is it going to

00:45:01.326 --> 00:45:05.119
insist on?
Anybody?

00:45:05.119 --> 00:45:07.270
They're going to insist on
collateral.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:23.243
What is collateral?
I'm somewhat charmed to see how

00:45:23.243 --> 00:45:25.199
few of you are going to end up
borrowing money,

00:45:25.199 --> 00:45:27.093
but for those of you who
haven't got trust funds,

00:45:27.093 --> 00:45:28.710
you're going to end up
borrowing money.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:33.360
So what is collateral?
Yes, what's collateral?

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.573
Student: You give
someone the whole--You let the

00:45:35.573 --> 00:45:38.276
bank hold onto something.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:45:38.276 --> 00:45:41.823
Right, you let the bank hold
onto something in the event that

00:45:41.823 --> 00:45:44.503
you default on the loan.
You're going to let the bank

00:45:44.503 --> 00:45:46.940
hold onto something in the event
that you default on the loan.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.070
Now for most people here,
what are they going to post as

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.856
collateral?
Let's assume that we're back to

00:45:52.856 --> 00:45:56.947
our original contract here--we
can't do this--we're back to our

00:45:56.947 --> 00:46:00.135
original case.
Wwhat are most of you going to

00:46:00.135 --> 00:46:03.440
end up using as collateral if
you borrow money?

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:05.706
Everyone's saying a house,
I'm guessing that for most of

00:46:05.706 --> 00:46:08.096
you --I'm not going to look
around the room because I don't

00:46:08.096 --> 00:46:10.568
know how many trust fund babies
I've got in the room--but for

00:46:10.568 --> 00:46:11.989
most of you,
it's going to be what?

00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:16.489
It's going to be your parent's
house.

00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:20.680
So why is it that your parent's
house being posted as collateral

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.471
is going to prevent you from
disappearing to Mexico with a

00:46:24.471 --> 00:46:26.145
loan?
Well let's have a look at how

00:46:26.145 --> 00:46:29.967
that changes the payoffs.
Now if you take the money and

00:46:29.967 --> 00:46:35.781
run, you disappear to Mexico,
but you end up with $1 minus a

00:46:35.781 --> 00:46:39.920
house here, and $3 minus a house
there.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.008
Of course, we're relying here
on you liking your parents

00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:44.286
enough not to mind about the
fact that they'll be sleeping in

00:46:44.286 --> 00:46:46.728
the rain,
but as long as that's the case,

00:46:46.728 --> 00:46:50.375
I think with high probability
you're now going to decide to

00:46:50.375 --> 00:46:53.200
return the loan,
at least if you can.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:55.865
Is that right?
Now notice that the way in

00:46:55.865 --> 00:46:58.537
which this collateral works.
There's a subtlety to how this

00:46:58.537 --> 00:47:01.753
collateral works.
You might think that the way in

00:47:01.753 --> 00:47:06.460
which collateral works is that
now the lender feels safer,

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.165
because even if you end up
defaulting on the loan,

00:47:10.165 --> 00:47:13.530
at least they get this house.
That's true.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:17.138
There's some truth in that,
but that's really not the key

00:47:17.138 --> 00:47:19.531
here.
Frankly, most bank lenders

00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:23.013
don't want your parent's house.
Your parents might have very

00:47:23.013 --> 00:47:25.238
nice houses but this isn't a
good housing market right now

00:47:25.238 --> 00:47:27.502
and they don't particularly want
to see your parents on the

00:47:27.502 --> 00:47:30.281
streets.
The way in which this works is

00:47:30.281 --> 00:47:34.522
not so much that it gives an
extra positive return to the

00:47:34.522 --> 00:47:38.038
lender,
the way in which it works is it

00:47:38.038 --> 00:47:42.309
gives an extra negative return
to the borrower.

00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:45.622
So let's just do this backward
induction again with the house

00:47:45.622 --> 00:47:48.021
in place.
So with this house in place,

00:47:48.021 --> 00:47:50.644
as before, you'll return the
loan up here,

00:47:50.644 --> 00:47:53.780
but now provided you like your
parents enough,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:59.036
you would also return the loan
here because you prefer $2 to $3

00:47:59.036 --> 00:48:07.341
minus your parent's house,
in which case you'll get a loan

00:48:07.341 --> 00:48:10.056
of 3.
So the way in which the

00:48:10.056 --> 00:48:14.075
collateral worked was by hurting
you enough (or in this case

00:48:14.075 --> 00:48:17.889
hurting your parents enough) in
the event of default,

00:48:17.889 --> 00:48:21.450
in such a way as to change your
behavior.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:27.048
But notice it helped you.
So here's a subtlety coming in

00:48:27.048 --> 00:48:29.265
here.
By issuing collateral,

00:48:29.265 --> 00:48:34.024
we actually lowered the payoff
of the borrower at certain end

00:48:34.024 --> 00:48:37.504
points of the tree.
We lowered the payoff of the

00:48:37.504 --> 00:48:40.230
borrower at certain end points
of the tree.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:45.663
But as a consequence we were
able to end up at an outcome

00:48:45.663 --> 00:48:49.059
that was better for the
borrower.

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:53.688
Sometimes having lower payoffs
can actually make you better

00:48:53.688 --> 00:48:57.360
off, and the reason it makes you
better off,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.375
is it changes the behavior of
other players in the game in

00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:05.256
such a way as may benefit you;
in this example,

00:49:05.256 --> 00:49:10.340
by inducing the lender to give
you a bigger loan.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:22.223
So the way the collateral works
is it lowers your payoffs if you

00:49:22.223 --> 00:49:29.390
do not repay,
but it leads to you being

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:39.811
better off.
The reason it makes you better

00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:56.260
off is it changes the choices of
others in a way that helps you.

00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:01.332
We're going to see lots of
examples of that in the next

00:50:01.332 --> 00:50:04.423
couple of days.
Now collateral is an example,

00:50:04.423 --> 00:50:07.203
we talked about incentive
design, collateral is also an

00:50:07.203 --> 00:50:12.282
example of something larger.
The larger thing is the idea of

00:50:12.282 --> 00:50:20.621
commitment.
Collateral is a commitment

00:50:20.621 --> 00:50:31.409
strategy.
It commits you to repaying the

00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:34.546
loan.
I want to give another example

00:50:34.546 --> 00:50:36.756
of a commitment strategy.
I think this idea of

00:50:36.756 --> 00:50:39.536
commitments is an important one,
and we have just about time to

00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:41.608
do it.
So I wanted to go completely

00:50:41.608 --> 00:50:45.004
away from our context of our
lender borrower game a second

00:50:45.004 --> 00:50:47.150
and look somewhere else
entirely,

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:56.900
so we get rid of this for now.
I want to take us back to 1066,

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.634
what happened in 1066?
What happened in 1066,

00:51:01.634 --> 00:51:06.848
I know this is America and no
one gets an education anymore,

00:51:06.848 --> 00:51:10.030
but still, what happened in
1066?

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:12.500
The Norman Conquest took place
in 1066.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.997
So the Norman Army invades from
Normandy led by William the

00:51:16.997 --> 00:51:21.340
Conqueror and lands on the
Sussex beaches at Hastings.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:25.263
What I want to imagine is a
game involving the Norman Army,

00:51:25.263 --> 00:51:29.390
or William the Conqueror in
particular, and the Saxon Army.

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:33.138
So here's the little game.
So we're in the area of

00:51:33.138 --> 00:51:37.440
medieval military strategy,
and here is the game.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:42.182
We'll start with the Saxon's
here, the Norman's have already

00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:47.085
invaded, so I guess the Norman's
have already moved but here's

00:51:47.085 --> 00:51:50.059
the Saxon Army making a
decision.

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:57.458
They're deciding between
fighting and the important

00:51:57.458 --> 00:52:04.710
medieval military tactic known
as running away.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.426
Of course the Normans are going
to know whether the Saxons are

00:52:07.426 --> 00:52:10.010
actually going to charge down
the beach and attack them,

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:16.428
and they are going to have to
decide whether to fight or run

00:52:16.428 --> 00:52:18.850
away.
Let's put the payoffs--now

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:22.489
leave some space below here,
leave some space down here on

00:52:22.489 --> 00:52:24.980
our notes--let's put the payoffs
in.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:28.299
So I'm going to put the Norman
payoffs first and the Saxon

00:52:28.299 --> 00:52:30.808
payoffs second.
Norman payoffs first,

00:52:30.808 --> 00:52:34.170
Saxon payoffs second.
So the payoffs are going to be

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.228
like this.
If both sides fight,

00:52:36.228 --> 00:52:40.099
a lot of people end up dead and
we'll call that (0,0).

00:52:40.099 --> 00:52:42.535
If the Saxons fight and the
Normans run away,

00:52:42.535 --> 00:52:45.523
the Saxons get 2 and the
Normans get 1 because at least

00:52:45.523 --> 00:52:49.030
they're alive.
If the Saxons run away and the

00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:52.711
Normans fight,
then the Normans get 2 and the

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:55.329
Saxons get 1.
I just flip things around.

00:52:55.329 --> 00:52:59.978
And if both lots run away then
ultimately it's good for the

00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:03.900
Saxons.
So this is the game.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:09.211
Let's be careful,
I've put the Saxon payoff

00:53:09.211 --> 00:53:11.930
second.
If we analyze this game by

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:15.760
backward induction we can see
that the Normans are in trouble.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:20.118
Why are the Normans in trouble?
Because if they are attacked by

00:53:20.118 --> 00:53:25.195
the Saxons then fighting yields
0 and running away yields 1,

00:53:25.195 --> 00:53:29.333
so they're going to run away.
Conversely, if the Saxons run

00:53:29.333 --> 00:53:31.671
away then in fact,
the Normans will stay and fight

00:53:31.671 --> 00:53:34.391
because it's easy to stay and
fight against people who are

00:53:34.391 --> 00:53:38.340
running away.
Even I can do that.

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:41.019
So they're going to go for 2
rather than 1.

00:53:41.019 --> 00:53:43.902
But now the Saxons face this
choice, they know that if they

00:53:43.902 --> 00:53:46.834
attack the Normans the Norman's
will run away and the Saxons

00:53:46.834 --> 00:53:49.289
will get 2.
But if the Saxons run away then

00:53:49.289 --> 00:53:52.433
the Norman's will stay and
fight, and the Saxons will only

00:53:52.433 --> 00:53:56.767
get 1.
So the Saxons are going to end

00:53:56.767 --> 00:53:59.929
up fighting.
Everyone see how we did the

00:53:59.929 --> 00:54:03.106
backward induction?
So this is not a good situation

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:07.239
if you happen to be the Norman
commander, if you're the guy who

00:54:07.239 --> 00:54:09.840
led these troops across the
channel.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:14.220
So what did William the
Conqueror do?

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.004
He burned his ships.
So let's now make this game a

00:54:17.004 --> 00:54:19.289
little bit more like the real
historical situation,

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:23.723
here's a move that William the
Conqueror, the King of the

00:54:23.723 --> 00:54:28.906
Normans can do.
He can either not burn his

00:54:28.906 --> 00:54:34.978
ships or he can burn them.
If he burns them then the game

00:54:34.978 --> 00:54:39.016
is rather different.
Once again, the Saxons can

00:54:39.016 --> 00:54:45.162
decide whether to fight or run
away, but now the Normans really

00:54:45.162 --> 00:54:49.889
don't have any choice.
They have to stay and fight

00:54:49.889 --> 00:54:54.889
because swimming back to France
wearing armor is difficult.

00:54:54.889 --> 00:55:01.679
So the payoffs become (0,0) and
(2,1) as before.

00:55:01.679 --> 00:55:04.489
So we know now that the Normans
are going to stay and fight.

00:55:04.489 --> 00:55:06.110
That's all that's available to
them.

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:08.608
I've put it that they don't
even have the option of running

00:55:08.608 --> 00:55:09.693
away.
If you want,

00:55:09.693 --> 00:55:13.543
you could put running yields
them minus infinity or whatever

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:16.863
it is to get drowned.
So now if the Saxons,

00:55:16.863 --> 00:55:21.873
if the Norman's have burnt the
boats, the Saxons know that if

00:55:21.873 --> 00:55:24.880
they fight the Saxons will get
0,

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:30.630
if they run away they'll get
-1, so now they'll run away.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:32.813
Then from William the
Conqueror's point of view,

00:55:32.813 --> 00:55:36.129
what's he choosing between?
He knows that if he doesn't

00:55:36.129 --> 00:55:40.506
burn his boats the Saxons will
fight, and his troops will run

00:55:40.506 --> 00:55:43.763
away.
But if he does burn his boats,

00:55:43.763 --> 00:55:48.664
the Saxons will run away and
his troops will fight so he

00:55:48.664 --> 00:55:54.360
wants to burn his boats.
Everyone okay with the example?

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:59.485
Now this is probably the
classic example of a commitment

00:55:59.485 --> 00:56:01.710
strategy.
William the Conqueror,

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:04.167
in this example,
or Cortez in perhaps the more

00:56:04.167 --> 00:56:06.908
famous example,
burned the boats to get rid of

00:56:06.908 --> 00:56:09.369
some strategies,
to get rid of some choices

00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:12.955
altogether.
And you might think how can

00:56:12.955 --> 00:56:17.360
getting rid of choices make me
better off?

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:20.475
The reason, in a game,
particularly in a sequential

00:56:20.475 --> 00:56:23.909
game, in a game generally,
the reason getting rid of

00:56:23.909 --> 00:56:27.896
choices can make me better off
is it changes the behavior of

00:56:27.896 --> 00:56:32.019
people on the other side of the
game in such a way as benefits

00:56:32.019 --> 00:56:34.975
me.
In this particular example,

00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:39.090
it makes the other side less
likely to fight.

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:48.742
So once again this is a
commitment and the way it works

00:56:48.742 --> 00:56:58.932
is--this example of a commitment
is actually to have fewer

00:56:58.932 --> 00:57:07.869
options and it changes the
behavior of others.

00:57:07.869 --> 00:57:14.873
If it didn't change the
behavior of others it wouldn't

00:57:14.873 --> 00:57:18.276
be worth doing.
So let's just talk about this a

00:57:18.276 --> 00:57:20.926
little bit more.
There's another famous example

00:57:20.926 --> 00:57:23.280
of a military commitment
strategy.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.969
It occurs in the movie Dr.
Strangelove.

00:57:25.969 --> 00:57:28.191
How many of you have seen the
movie Dr.

00:57:28.191 --> 00:57:30.102
Strangelove?
How many of you have not seen

00:57:30.102 --> 00:57:31.119
the movie Dr.
Strangelove?

00:57:31.119 --> 00:57:33.841
Good homework exercise for the
weekend: rent the movie Dr.

00:57:33.841 --> 00:57:36.200
Strangelove.
It's a very good movie.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.395
Stanley Kubrick I think.
So in Dr.

00:57:38.395 --> 00:57:41.106
Strangelove,
there's a famous commitment

00:57:41.106 --> 00:57:43.599
strategy.
What is the famous commitment

00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:45.260
strategy in Dr.
Strangelove?

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.440
Somebody?
Let's get a mike.

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.410
Ale can we get a mike down here?
There's one on the way.

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:56.786
The guy in white, there you go.
Student: They lose radio

00:57:56.786 --> 00:57:59.313
contact with the base,
which means that they're going

00:57:59.313 --> 00:58:01.476
to end up dropping the bomb.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:58:01.476 --> 00:58:03.194
right, that's true.
I was thinking of something

00:58:03.194 --> 00:58:05.483
more deliberate.
What's the more deliberate--the

00:58:05.483 --> 00:58:08.050
guy in red--while you're there,
somebody in red here.

00:58:08.050 --> 00:58:11.143
Here we go.
Student: The Soviets

00:58:11.143 --> 00:58:13.150
construct a doomsday device so
if they're attacked they

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.119
automatically launch all of
their nuclear weapons.

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:17.773
Professor Ben Polak:
Good, so the worry that the

00:58:17.773 --> 00:58:20.769
Soviets have is they think the
Americans might attack them,

00:58:20.769 --> 00:58:23.269
and they worry that the
Americans might attack them

00:58:23.269 --> 00:58:25.119
thinking that they won't
retaliate,

00:58:25.119 --> 00:58:27.851
because they won't really have
any incentive to retaliate once

00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:30.947
their cities are destroyed.
So they construct a device they

00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:34.193
called the doomsday device that
will automatically launch

00:58:34.193 --> 00:58:37.498
nuclear missiles back on the
Americans if the Russians are

00:58:37.498 --> 00:58:40.482
attacked.
It's a commitment device to

00:58:40.482 --> 00:58:45.553
make it credible that they will
actually respond were they to be

00:58:45.553 --> 00:58:49.898
attacked by the crazy Americans.
So there's a mistake,

00:58:49.898 --> 00:58:52.300
however, that the Russians
make.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:57.800
What is the mistake that the
Russians make?

00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:02.880
The guy in the Yale sweatshirt
here.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.780
Student: They don't tell
anyone about the machine.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:07.445
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, they don't tell the

00:59:07.445 --> 00:59:10.010
Americans that they've built the
doomsday device.

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:13.050
So this is really an important
idea hidden in what's really a

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.230
great movie.
Commitment strategies are a

00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:17.440
good idea.
They can make things credible.

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.556
But the only reason that having
fewer strategies is good for you

00:59:21.556 --> 00:59:25.150
is because it changes the
behavior on the other side.

00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:27.440
In this case,
it changes the behavior of the

00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:30.235
Saxons.
It doesn't work if the other

00:59:30.235 --> 00:59:36.745
side doesn't know about it.
It's crucial that the other

00:59:36.745 --> 00:59:50.280
side knows.
So the other players must know.

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:53.530
Just to hammer this home,
notice that the expression in

00:59:53.530 --> 00:59:56.360
the English language is "burning
your boats."

00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.962
It's not "going over to your
boats and quietly drilling a

00:59:59.962 --> 01:00:03.050
little hole in them," it's
burning your boats.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.705
You want the other side to see
this big bonfire on the beach

01:00:06.705 --> 01:00:09.989
and to know that the boats are
no longer available.

01:00:09.989 --> 01:00:11.863
Just as in Dr.
Strangelove,

01:00:11.863 --> 01:00:15.034
it's crucial,
and it's a terrible mistake for

01:00:15.034 --> 01:00:19.070
the Russians not to tell the
Americans that they've built

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:21.909
this machine.
So knowledge here is crucial,

01:00:21.909 --> 01:00:24.445
knowledge of the other side.
Now I should just complete the

01:00:24.445 --> 01:00:26.368
history of this.
This didn't work in the case of

01:00:26.368 --> 01:00:29.022
the Battle of Hastings.
The Saxons attacked anyway and

01:00:29.022 --> 01:00:31.144
it just turned,
it was a big blood bath,

01:00:31.144 --> 01:00:34.573
and the Normans really only won
this battle because somebody got

01:00:34.573 --> 01:00:37.239
a lucky shot and hit King Harold
in the eye.

01:00:37.239 --> 01:00:42.299
So this is a good story but as
a military tactic not actually a

01:00:42.299 --> 01:00:44.426
true story.
I'm adding that in,

01:00:44.426 --> 01:00:47.683
because otherwise I'm going to
get hundreds of letters from

01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:50.655
people who watched the video.
Now we've had a bunch of

01:00:50.655 --> 01:00:52.173
lessons today,
but I'm not done,

01:00:52.173 --> 01:00:55.062
I want to play one more game.
Before I do though I want to

01:00:55.062 --> 01:00:57.850
make sure we understand--we're
going to play another game so

01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:59.400
everybody stay put.
I want to make sure.

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.947
There's a bunch of lessons on
the board, and I want you to

01:01:01.947 --> 01:01:04.449
understand what's important and
what's more important.

01:01:04.449 --> 01:01:06.538
Everything is important,
but some things are more

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:09.670
important.
So the idea of commitment is an

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:13.039
important idea,
and the idea of incentive

01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:19.495
design is an important idea,
but there's one idea here that

01:01:19.495 --> 01:01:27.443
is more important than anything
else, and that idea is backward

01:01:27.443 --> 01:01:30.316
induction.
I'll put a little sun around it

01:01:30.316 --> 01:01:32.098
okay.
How important is backward

01:01:32.098 --> 01:01:34.537
induction?
Backward induction is the most

01:01:34.537 --> 01:01:37.992
important thing I'm going to
teach you in the second half of

01:01:37.992 --> 01:01:39.576
the semester.
It's probably the most

01:01:39.576 --> 01:01:41.400
important thing I'm going to
teach you in the whole semester,

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:45.263
and it may be the most
important thing you're going to

01:01:45.263 --> 01:01:48.056
learn at Yale.
It's the answer to all

01:01:48.056 --> 01:01:50.104
questions.
If I ask you a question,

01:01:50.104 --> 01:01:53.036
and, as happens from time to
time, you've been sleeping in

01:01:53.036 --> 01:01:56.019
class and you wake up startled
because I've now asked you a

01:01:56.019 --> 01:01:58.753
question,
and that camera is on you,

01:01:58.753 --> 01:02:03.246
and you don't know what the
question is, then the answer is

01:02:03.246 --> 01:02:06.651
backward induction.
I'm stressing this because six

01:02:06.651 --> 01:02:08.352
weeks from now,
whatever it is,

01:02:08.352 --> 01:02:10.564
in December,
there's going to be a final

01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:13.967
exam and I guarantee now that
there will be a question on the

01:02:13.967 --> 01:02:16.860
final exam that involves
backward induction,

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.740
and I guarantee that at least
one person in the room will

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.719
forget to solve it by backward
induction.

01:02:23.719 --> 01:02:25.941
So are you going to use
backward induction on the final

01:02:25.941 --> 01:02:27.319
exam?
Yes, you're all going to

01:02:27.319 --> 01:02:30.727
remember it.
Okay good, now we'll play one

01:02:30.727 --> 01:02:34.256
more game just for fun.
But before we play one more

01:02:34.256 --> 01:02:36.959
game, I'll do one other thing,
sorry one other thing before we

01:02:36.959 --> 01:02:38.510
play one more game,
I apologize.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:42.612
The one other thing I want to
do here is I put up a tree here

01:02:42.612 --> 01:02:46.099
but I forgot to tell you
anything about the tree.

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:48.960
This was a tree,
and I would be remiss if I

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.889
didn't tell you a few things
about trees.

01:02:51.889 --> 01:02:54.353
So there's a certain amount of
jargon that goes along with

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:57.032
trees, and I want you to go home
and read the textbook and know

01:02:57.032 --> 01:02:59.974
what that jargon is.
So these spots,

01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:06.960
these dots in the tree,
these things are called nodes.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.586
And in fact the end points of
the tree where the payoffs are,

01:03:12.586 --> 01:03:18.119
these are also called nodes but
they're called end nodes.

01:03:18.119 --> 01:03:22.942
These branches in the tree,
the branches,

01:03:22.942 --> 01:03:28.610
here they are,
the branches are called edges.

01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:33.355
So a tree consists of nodes,
edges, and these missing dots

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:37.233
are the end nodes.
The end nodes are associated

01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:38.739
with payoffs.
Do we need to write that?

01:03:38.739 --> 01:03:40.540
That's obvious right:
they're associated with

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:44.032
payoffs.
And every other node belongs to

01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:49.900
somebody whose turn it is to
make a decision at that node.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:54.681
These other nodes,
the ones that aren't end nodes

01:03:54.681 --> 01:03:58.895
are called decision nodes.
It's perfectly possible,

01:03:58.895 --> 01:04:01.272
for example,
in our Norman Conquest game,

01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:03.530
for somebody to have several
nodes.

01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:06.369
Somebody could move once and
then later on again.

01:04:06.369 --> 01:04:09.190
There may be also nodes that
are never reached in a game.

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:14.710
One last piece of jargon,
a route through a tree,

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:20.230
from the beginning to an end is
called a path,

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:22.360
a way of getting through the
tree from beginning to end.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.293
So we'll have a pop quiz on the
jargon later and now let's play

01:04:26.293 --> 01:04:34.390
the last game I want to play.
We've got ten minutes right?

01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:37.360
Everyone understand the jargon?
I want to play a game now.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.781
So the game we're going to play
is a game we're going to call

01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:46.700
the "Hungry Lion Game."
And what I'm going to do is I'm

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.752
going to pick on a row of the
class, actually I'm going to

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:53.060
pick on this row of the class,
and this row of the class,

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.284
everyone can see this row?
From up there,

01:04:55.284 --> 01:04:57.873
lean over the balcony.
This row of the class,

01:04:57.873 --> 01:05:02.210
we're going to imagine that
everybody in this row is a lion.

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:04.400
Do they all look like lions?
Not much, but never mind.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.409
Pretend their lions:
suspension of disbelief.

01:05:07.409 --> 01:05:13.028
They're all lions and they're
all hungry except for one

01:05:13.028 --> 01:05:18.230
person, who's this guy at the
end whose name is?

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:24.533
So Alex is a sheep.
Alex had the misfortune of

01:05:24.533 --> 01:05:29.259
wandering into this pack
of--pride of lions and is liable

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.550
to get eaten because they're
hungry.

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:39.337
However, one thing stands
between Alex the sheep and being

01:05:39.337 --> 01:05:41.584
eaten.
The one thing that stands

01:05:41.584 --> 01:05:44.329
between him and being eaten is
that in lion society,

01:05:44.329 --> 01:05:50.452
the only lion who is allowed to
eat the sheep is the head lion,

01:05:50.452 --> 01:05:53.810
the big lion whose name is
Ryan.

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:58.150
Ryan is the head lion here.
Only Ryan can eat Alex the

01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:01.514
sheep.
No other lion can eat Alex the

01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:03.931
sheep.
Now there's a catch if Ryan

01:06:03.931 --> 01:06:07.110
eats Alex--if Ryan the lion eats
Alex the sheep.

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:10.275
The catch is,
that if Ryan the lion eats Alex

01:06:10.275 --> 01:06:14.448
the sheep, then Ryan the lion
will fall into a postprandial

01:06:14.448 --> 01:06:16.367
stupor,
fall asleep,

01:06:16.367 --> 01:06:21.726
at which point the second
largest lion whose name is Chris

01:06:21.726 --> 01:06:25.183
can eat Ryan.
Now notice Chris can never eat

01:06:25.183 --> 01:06:27.480
the sheep.
He can only ever eat the lion,

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.693
the big lion,
and only then if the lion has

01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:31.590
eaten the sheep and falls
asleep.

01:06:31.590 --> 01:06:35.439
This is very strict.
Lion society is very

01:06:35.439 --> 01:06:39.095
hierarchical like England.
If, however,

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:41.372
Ryan the lion eats Alex the
sheep, and is then eaten,

01:06:41.372 --> 01:06:43.650
falls asleep and is then eaten
by Chris the lion,

01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:47.711
then and only then he will fall
into a stupor at which point he

01:06:47.711 --> 01:06:51.655
can be eaten by Isabella,
who's the third largest lion

01:06:51.655 --> 01:06:54.559
and so on.
Everyone understand the game?

01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:56.719
No questions,
no talking among yourselves.

01:06:56.719 --> 01:07:01.393
Write down what you would do if
you were our key decision maker,

01:07:01.393 --> 01:07:05.687
who is Ryan the lion.
But before we write it down can

01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:10.360
I get Alex to stand up a second,
stand up, camera on him,

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.780
this is the menu.
Thank you.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:17.561
So you have to write down in
your notepad whether,

01:07:17.561 --> 01:07:21.034
you, Ryan the lion,
in Ryan's shoes or paws or

01:07:21.034 --> 01:07:24.969
whatever, whether you would eat
Alex the sheep.

01:07:24.969 --> 01:07:27.260
Everybody written something
down?

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.673
Let's ask Ryan the lion what
he's going to do,

01:07:29.673 --> 01:07:32.140
so Ryan are you going to eat
Alex the sheep?

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.058
Student: No.
Professor Ben Polak: He

01:07:34.058 --> 01:07:35.889
says no, he's not going to eat
it, why not?

01:07:35.889 --> 01:07:38.225
Student: Well then
because I would be eaten as

01:07:38.225 --> 01:07:38.993
well.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:07:38.993 --> 01:07:40.303
Then he'd be eaten.
Well let's see if he would have

01:07:40.303 --> 01:07:42.357
been eaten.
So had he eaten Alex the sheep,

01:07:42.357 --> 01:07:45.387
then he would have fallen
asleep, and then he'd have been

01:07:45.387 --> 01:07:47.390
in danger of being eaten by
Chris.

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:50.239
Chris would you have eaten Ryan?
Student: No.

01:07:50.239 --> 01:07:52.108
Professor Ben Polak: So
he wouldn't have eaten him in

01:07:52.108 --> 01:07:53.882
fact.
In fact, it looks like Ryan

01:07:53.882 --> 01:07:56.812
would have got a free lunch.
There are no free lunches in

01:07:56.812 --> 01:07:59.739
Economics, so something's wrong.
Why is Chris worried about it?

01:07:59.739 --> 01:08:03.579
Chris is worried about it
because--Chris is worried about

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:06.940
Isabella eating him,
and what am I doing wrong?

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:09.998
What's wrong with this analysis?
By the way, before we say

01:08:09.998 --> 01:08:12.371
what's wrong,
how many of you in Ryan's shoes

01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:16.338
would have eaten the sheep?
How many of you would not have

01:08:16.338 --> 01:08:21.050
eaten the sheep?
Okay, what am I doing wrong?

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:22.500
I'm in totally the wrong part
of the room.

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:25.712
I shouldn't be here at all.
I shouldn't be at all in this

01:08:25.712 --> 01:08:27.430
part of the classroom.
I can't get around.

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:31.500
Wait a second.
Excuse me.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.150
I should be,-- which row were
my lions?

01:08:36.150 --> 01:08:40.498
Where's my lion row?
I should be way over here with

01:08:40.498 --> 01:08:43.739
the baby lion,
whose name is Agay.

01:08:43.739 --> 01:08:46.376
So Agay is a little baby
lion--very cute--but Agay,

01:08:46.376 --> 01:08:48.750
if he gets a chance to eat is
going to eat.

01:08:48.750 --> 01:08:52.886
Why is he going to eat?
Because there's no one to eat

01:08:52.886 --> 01:08:55.690
him.
So if Agay gets the chance to

01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:59.546
eat the second babiest lion
whose name is John,

01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:03.479
then Agay will eat.
So if John gets a chance to eat

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:07.739
Ben, is John going to eat Ben?
John are you going to eat Ben?

01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:10.619
No, John's not going to eat Ben
because John knows he'll get

01:09:10.619 --> 01:09:13.526
eaten by Agay.
So Ben, if you get a chance to

01:09:13.526 --> 01:09:16.290
eat Vidur, are you going to eat
Vidur?

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:19.935
Wait a second.
We just argued that if you eat

01:09:19.935 --> 01:09:24.147
then the second largest lion
whose name was John is not going

01:09:24.147 --> 01:09:26.020
to eat you.
Yes.

01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:28.449
So we know the littlest lion is
going to eat.

01:09:28.449 --> 01:09:30.470
So the second littlest is not
going to eat.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.909
So the third littlest lion can
eat safely.

01:09:32.909 --> 01:09:37.229
So the fourth littlest lion
should not eat.

01:09:37.229 --> 01:09:38.340
So the fifth littlest lion
should eat.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:39.942
We've got eat,
not eat, eat,

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:41.486
not eat, eat,
not eat, eat,

01:09:41.486 --> 01:09:43.029
not eat, eat,
not eat,

01:09:43.029 --> 01:09:44.996
eat, not eat,
eat, not eat,

01:09:44.996 --> 01:09:46.962
eat, not eat,
eat, not eat,

01:09:46.962 --> 01:09:49.760
eat, not eat,
eat, is that right?

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.023
So in fact he should have eaten
him, but the more important

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:55.780
point is how should we have
analyzed this game?

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:59.399
What should we have used?
Backward induction.

01:09:59.399 --> 01:10:02.689
How many of you used backward
induction?

01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:05.229
Be honest, so what's the point
here?

01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:08.779
The point is this:
five minutes ago I said the

01:10:08.779 --> 01:10:13.275
most important thing you'll ever
learn at Yale is backward

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:16.881
induction,
then I distracted you with some

01:10:16.881 --> 01:10:21.401
fairly irrelevant nonsense,
and five minutes later nobody

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:24.999
used backward induction.
So the main lesson from today,

01:10:24.999 --> 01:10:27.744
this is where we're going to
pick up on Wednesday is to use

01:10:27.744 --> 01:10:29.590
something, what are we going to
use?

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:31.292
Backward induction.
All right we'll see you on

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.292
Wednesday.

RONALD SMITH: There's two
subjects left in

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:04.800
the course now.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.633
One is kind of a brief
introduction to some air

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:14.267
pollution issues, and I've
really narrowed that down.

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:18.033
We're just going to pretty much
talk about the two ozone

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.167
problems. I'll explain what I
mean by that in just a minute.

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:24.800
And then the last subject of
the course, which will come

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.100
after break, will be
renewable energy.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.600
We'll look at how environment
and energy connect together.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.600
So if you go on the EPA website,
they've got a list of

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.633
all the different air pollutants
that they are

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:43.667
concerned about, and this is
roughly their list. I've

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:46.467
combined a couple of things,
but this is roughly their

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:49.867
list. It's a big list. And, of
course, every one of these

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:54.567
kind of has its own story,
its own sources.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.000
The way it moves around in the
atmosphere, the way chemical

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
reactions may change these
quantities in the atmosphere,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.033
and the way they impact human
health are all different.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.700
So we can't possibly treat that
complex subject in just a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.200
couple of lectures.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.467
But I just wanted to make a
couple of comments about this.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:19.067
In general, this is what EPA is
concerned about, and things

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:20.067
are getting better.

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:32.667
So, for example, if you plot
some of these emissions I'm

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.933
sorry, concentrations on a
relative scale, so this isn't

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.000
an absolute scale, they're just
calling everything in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
1980 they're giving us a value
of 100, and then plotting

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.933
these quantities as they've
changed since the year 1980.

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:53.167
So they've got nitrous oxide,
sulfur dioxide, carbon

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:54.833
monoxide, and lead.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.567
So I think you know some of
these stories, right?

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.100
So they took the lead out of
gasoline, so they're no longer

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.433
getting tailpipe emissions
of lead.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:13.467
They've put SO2 scrubbers on
about half of the coal-fired

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.700
power plants around the country,
so that's been

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.800
decreasing.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.867
And they've instituted this
program of checking your car

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.833
to be sure you are within
emission standards.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.800
So the manufacturers have been
asked to improve the vehicles

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.767
in terms of how they emit NO2
and CO, and then you are

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:41.967
required at least I am required
here in Connecticut

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:46.367
to occasionally get my car
tested to see whether I'm with

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:47.933
emission standards.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:51.300
So the combination of these
different activities have

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.433
brought generally the
concentrations of these

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:56.333
quantities down.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:02.600
And if we can thank someone,
it's basically, back in 1970,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.967
two important things happened.

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:08.500
The Clean Air Act was enacted,
and the EPA was founded.

00:03:11.633 --> 00:03:17.567
And I was doing some YouTube
googling the other day, and I

00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:22.833
found a celebration that took
place last year, celebrating

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:28.267
the 40th anniversary of
the Clean Air Act.

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:31.633
And they were telling stories
about the formation and the

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.033
politics involved.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.900
And it was rather amazing,
because the Clean Air Act,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.233
which was a very powerful piece
of legislation, actually

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:46.767
passed the House and the
Senate by very strong

00:03:46.767 --> 00:03:48.133
majorities, like 90%.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:51.300
In other words, both parties,
Republicans and Democrats,

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.567
voted strongly for this issue.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:04:00.800
And in fact, in 1990 when they
enacted some changes

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.167
strengthening certain areas of
the Clean Air Act, again both

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:08.467
parties voted strongly
in favor of it.

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:09.533
Now that would never happen.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.033
It would never even
come close.

00:04:11.033 --> 00:04:14.300
You couldn't get anything
changed on this at the moment,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.000
except possibly pulling back on
some of these regulations.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.033
So it's worth just thinking
briefly about the history of

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.433
this and the real
impact it's had.

00:04:23.433 --> 00:04:26.467
Now, OK, so these aren't Some
of these reductions are only

00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:28.567
by half and so on.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.267
And you'd like to have much
stronger reductions that that.

00:04:31.267 --> 00:04:36.167
But still, it's a remarkable
example of how scientists can

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:40.933
identify a problem, work out the
causes of the problem, and

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:47.367
then the legislature can react
to that and make some laws

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:51.433
that help the situation in the
long run over decades.

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:54.133
It's nice to know that
that's possible or

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:55.900
at least was possible.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:07.300
This SO2 thing is big because
that leads to acid rain.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.867
The SO2 is emitted
from smokestacks.

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:13.300
Coal has sulfur in it, so
when you burn coal,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.567
you oxidize the sulfur.

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:15.900
You get SO2.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.700
That goes into the atmosphere.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.967
Some of it forms small particles
that get caught up

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:25.233
in raindrops and rained out.

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:30.200
But having SO2 dissolved in your
raindrop makes that water

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:38.833
acid, which has a big impact on
the organisms and the soils

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.233
and the rivers.

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:44.567
And so we've seen actually a
rather dramatic improvement in

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:48.267
the acidity of rainfall, not
shown on that last graph.

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.100
Well, that last graph showed
the SO2, but if you look at

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.000
the acidity of rain that falls
from the sky, that, too, has

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.267
gotten less acidic over the
last 20 or 30 years.

00:05:59.267 --> 00:06:05.300
So that's another side of that
general success story.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.567
But what we're going to do here
in this course is just

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:15.267
look at these two problems, the
two ozone problems. Ozone

00:06:15.267 --> 00:06:20.700
in the troposphere, especially
in the boundary layer of the

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.367
Earth, that is related to
this problem called

00:06:24.367 --> 00:06:27.100
photochemical smog.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.667
It's an air pollution problem.

00:06:28.667 --> 00:06:32.400
And then the other problem
is stratospheric ozone.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.533
And the problems here are
different in their chemistry,

00:06:37.533 --> 00:06:40.867
different in the way they
interact with the atmosphere,

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:43.333
and they're also different in
the most fundamental way.

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:47.667
We've got too much ozone in
photochemical smog, and we're

00:06:47.667 --> 00:06:50.900
worried about having too
little ozone in the

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.333
stratospheric ozone layer.

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:56.833
So these are different in many
respects even though they all

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.933
relate to the same molecule,
O3 ozone.

00:07:00.933 --> 00:07:06.767
That's going to be the focus of
both of these discussions.

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:08.933
Stop me if you have questions.

00:07:08.933 --> 00:07:12.000
So a few things you have
to know about ozone,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.067
it's formula is O3.

00:07:14.067 --> 00:07:18.533
It's just like the oxygen that
you're breathing in.

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:20.533
That's O2.

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:23.467
But this has one more
oxygen atom attached

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:25.867
to it so it's O3.

00:07:25.867 --> 00:07:31.633
It's molecular weight then,
instead of being 32, is 48.

00:07:31.633 --> 00:07:34.667
It does obey the Perfect
Gas Law.

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:38.800
It is a strong oxidant,
however, much

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.767
stronger than O2.

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:47.333
If you put ozone next to some
organic substrate, it will

00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:52.167
immediately attack that and try
to oxidize the substance

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:53.700
that it's touching.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:56.533
It also has important radiative
properties.

00:07:56.533 --> 00:07:57.867
It's a greenhouse gas.

00:07:57.867 --> 00:08:03.067
It can absorb and emit
infrared radiation.

00:08:03.067 --> 00:08:06.333
That's not surprising because
it has a dihedral structure,

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.433
oxygen-oxygen-oxygen.

00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:12.100
So as it vibrates,
it can absorb and

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.467
emit long-wave radiation.

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:17.367
In addition, though, it
emits--it can absorb

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:20.667
ultraviolet radiation, much
shorter wavelength.

00:08:20.667 --> 00:08:22.800
It does that by pushing
electrons up and

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.100
down in their orbitals.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.000
And these are both
important for us.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.567
Lifetime in the troposphere
is typically pretty

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:35.367
short, hours to days.

00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:36.800
Lifetime in the stratosphere
is quite a

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.733
bit longer than that.

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:41.433
Usually it's in years.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:44.667
I'll be defining something
called the Dobson unit, which

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:48.967
is the way we measure the total
amount of ozone in a

00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:51.800
column, going all the way
up and down through the

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.200
atmosphere.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.833
It's one of the common ways
that we talk to each other

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:59.267
about how much ozone is
in the atmosphere.

00:08:59.267 --> 00:09:01.767
And as I've indicated, in the
troposphere, we're interested

00:09:01.767 --> 00:09:03.300
in photochemical smog.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.033
In the boundary layer and the
stratosphere, we're interested

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:08.933
in the ozone layer.

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:14.600
So if you plot the amount of
ozone in the atmosphere versus

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.433
altitude, the altitude scale
is in kilometers.

00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:22.800
Now, this unit here
is a milliPascals.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.633
So what I've plotted is the
partial pressure of ozone.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:31.500
You know, when you have a
mixture of gases, every type

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.933
of molecule contributes
something to the total

00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:37.933
pressure of the gas.

00:09:37.933 --> 00:09:42.600
So this is the amount that
the ozone mixed into the

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.133
atmosphere contributes to
pressure, but it's a small

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:49.633
amount, so we're representing it
in milliPascals, that is, a

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:54.067
thousandths of a Pascal.

00:09:54.067 --> 00:09:59.967
And so you see a little elevated
ozone in the first

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:02.767
kilometer or so of the
atmosphere, and that's the

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.667
subject of one of the
discussions today.

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:10.833
And then, of course, you get
this rather large peak in

00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:13.267
ozone concentration up
in the stratosphere.

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:18.367
Peaked somewhere between 20 and
30 kilometers, that's the

00:10:18.367 --> 00:10:21.400
ozone layer.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.967
Questions on that?

00:10:23.967 --> 00:10:25.833
STUDENT: What accounts
for that peak?

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.933
PROFESSOR: Well, so there's a
formation process

00:10:28.933 --> 00:10:31.200
going up there that involves
ultraviolet--

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.600
I'll talk about this later,
but I'll give you

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.433
a preview of it.

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:37.033
There's ultraviolet radiation
coming from the sun that will

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:41.233
dissociate a regular
oxygen molecule.

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:42.667
So you start with an O2.

00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:47.667
You break it into O's, and then
it'll recombine in some

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:52.167
cases as two O3 molecules.

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:56.500
Usually that's short lived,
but when I get to that

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.067
section, I'll talk about how
it recycles, but then goes

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:01.167
back to ozone.

00:11:01.167 --> 00:11:03.767
But it has to do with
ultraviolet light being able

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:07.867
to reach those elevations.

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.833
It's a bit complicated because
ozone--ultraviolet light is

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:13.967
also involved in its
destruction.

00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:16.400
So we're going to have to take a
careful look at that when we

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.667
get to that point.

00:11:20.067 --> 00:11:22.467
So for the moment, we're
going to focus on this

00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:24.033
tropospheric problem.

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:29.033
So we're going to be looking at
this only for probably the

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:33.233
rest of today's lecture.

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:36.500
So some of the factors that are
involved in photochemical

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:45.167
smog are the amount of oxides
of nitrogen being emitted.

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:49.300
That's mostly NO and NO2, and
they abbreviate that by

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.500
calling it NOx.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.933
In other words, you can put
a 1 or a 2 in there.

00:11:54.933 --> 00:11:57.500
There's also an abbreviation
VOC, which is

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.567
Volatile Organic Compounds.

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:06.333
It's like when you have a can
of gasoline and some of it

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:08.967
evaporates into the atmosphere,
that would be an

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:14.433
example of a volatile
organic compound.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:17.000
Organic, you know, means
it has carbon in it.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.833
Volatile means it likes to go
into the gaseous state.

00:12:20.833 --> 00:12:24.167
So a good example of that would
be gas evaporating from

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:27.567
your tank and going into
the atmosphere.

00:12:27.567 --> 00:12:31.533
Sometimes you see RH, and this
is confusing, because we've

00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:35.300
been using that almost
universally until now to mean

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.833
relative humidity.

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:40.367
But in this business, sometimes
RH is used to

00:12:40.367 --> 00:12:42.567
represent Reactive
Hydrocarbons.

00:12:45.633 --> 00:12:50.967
And in that way, it's almost
synonymous with volatile

00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:53.733
organic compounds.

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:56.367
The presence of an elevated
inversion is going to be

00:12:56.367 --> 00:12:59.433
important because we want to
know whether these emissions,

00:12:59.433 --> 00:13:02.800
the NOx and the VOC emissions,
are going to be trapped and

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.967
will be concentrated, or whether
they will be diluted

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:11.133
by mixing into large portions
of the atmosphere.

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:14.867
If there's a valley geometry,
that's important, too, because

00:13:14.867 --> 00:13:19.233
that also comes into the
question of dilution.

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:24.167
And then, as we will see,
sunlight and warmth will be a

00:13:24.167 --> 00:13:27.233
factor because there are certain
chemical reactions

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:30.800
that convert one form of
pollutant to another.

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.967
And those typically require
sunlight and warmth in order

00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:39.967
for those chemical reactions
to take place.

00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:44.533
So if you're trying to
understand why a particular

00:13:44.533 --> 00:13:48.267
part of the world has an air
pollution problem, like the LA

00:13:48.267 --> 00:13:53.667
Basin, or Santiago, Chile, or
Mexico City, it's these five

00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:58.667
factors that you want to look at
that will determine why one

00:13:58.667 --> 00:14:00.767
region has an air pollution
problem and

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.833
another region may not.

00:14:02.833 --> 00:14:05.633
It'll have to do with
those things.

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:09.267
We'll talk a lot more about
those in just a moment.

00:14:09.267 --> 00:14:13.267
So Mexico City, for example,
typically has

00:14:13.267 --> 00:14:15.100
this kind of haze.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.833
Now, looking at this, you
wouldn't know, I guess,

00:14:17.833 --> 00:14:23.900
whether that is just a fog, a
radiation fog, for example,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.967
except it's usually in the
Mexico City area, which is in

00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:33.233
kind of a big basin, it's
usually not found so much in

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:34.967
other basins.

00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:37.233
In other words, so it's not
just the fact that it's

00:14:37.233 --> 00:14:40.400
low-lying land, and there's a
clear sky, and you're getting

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.567
radiation fog.

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:46.200
It has to do with these
emissions of VOCs and NOxs

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.600
that are then reacting
to cause smog.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.633
Now, smog is a contraction
of smoke and fog.

00:14:52.633 --> 00:14:56.933
But today, it's used to work
to mean a kind of air

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:00.433
pollution with a certain
chemistry going on to cause

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:05.033
that particular combination of
particles and gases that are

00:15:05.033 --> 00:15:07.667
mixed in there together.

00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:13.100
Beijing has a similar problem,
as do many other

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.067
cities around the world.

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:22.567
Now, EPA sets limits on ozone
concentrations, ozone as a gas

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:25.267
now in the atmosphere.

00:15:25.267 --> 00:15:29.300
And these have changed from time
to time, but I believe

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.833
these are the current values.

00:15:31.833 --> 00:15:34.133
There's a one-hour standard and
an eight-hour standard.

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:41.467
So if you have an average ozone
concentration of greater

00:15:41.467 --> 00:15:49.233
than 0.12 parts per million by
volume for an hour, you are in

00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:57.333
exceedance of the one-hour
standard for ozone set by EPA.

00:15:57.333 --> 00:16:01.533
Even if you never reach that
value, but if the average over

00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:07.367
an eight-hour period is greater
than 0.01 parts per

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:12.700
million by volume, you're also
in exceedance of EPA standard.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:13.033
Yes?

00:16:13.033 --> 00:16:16.067
STUDENT: This is emission
by a plant or by a car?

00:16:16.067 --> 00:16:18.467
PROFESSOR: No, this is
concentration.

00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:21.300
So this is measured in
the atmosphere as now

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.300
what's being emitted.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:27.467
As we'll see in a moment,
nothing emits ozone.

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:30.800
So this certainly could not
be an emission standard.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.100
Ozone is created in the
atmosphere from

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.300
other chemical emissions.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.000
So this is purely a
concentration standard.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.400
So for example, the
EPA in Connecticut

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.800
would set up a station.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.133
There used to be one here
in Connecticut.

00:16:47.133 --> 00:16:49.233
I don't know if it's still here,
and a few others around

00:16:49.233 --> 00:16:52.400
the state, where they measure
ozone concentration in the

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.733
atmosphere hourly.

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:58.033
And they determine whether or
not they are approaching or

00:16:58.033 --> 00:17:00.967
exceeding these EPA standards.

00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:01.367
Question?

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:05.267
STUDENT: So since it's not like
one body that's creating

00:17:05.267 --> 00:17:08.233
this, what happens
when it exceeds?

00:17:08.233 --> 00:17:11.667
How does the city or the
region within it

00:17:11.667 --> 00:17:12.467
PROFESSOR: Yeah, we'll
talk about

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:13.067
that a little bit.

00:17:13.067 --> 00:17:16.033
But you can imagine it's
confusing because you cannot

00:17:16.033 --> 00:17:19.633
track this down often to
a single polluter.

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:22.767
It's kind of a regional thing.

00:17:22.767 --> 00:17:26.533
Now, I've given this EPA
standard to you, and they give

00:17:26.533 --> 00:17:29.267
it to you in two different
units.

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:32.467
And because we are familiar
with such things in this

00:17:32.467 --> 00:17:36.267
course, I wanted to spend a few
minutes just guaranteeing

00:17:36.267 --> 00:17:40.267
that you can work with both
of those types of units.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.300
These are important numbers.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:47.233
So that's a part per million by
volume, so that is a ratio

00:17:47.233 --> 00:17:49.167
of the number of molecules.

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:55.633
That would be well, let me
multiply that by 1,000.

00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:59.167
That would be one, two, three.

00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:06.067
That would be 120 molecules of
ozone for every billion,

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:10.267
because I multiplied by
that for every billion

00:18:10.267 --> 00:18:11.767
molecules of air.

00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:16.033
Or if you prefer it this way,
it's about 0.1 it's hard to

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:17.067
split up a molecule.

00:18:17.067 --> 00:18:22.200
That's why it's hard to say it
this way, but 0.12 molecules

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.700
of ozone for every million
molecules of air, OK?

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.233
So that's in the form
of a mixing ratio

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:33.100
by number of molecules.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:36.967
This is a mass density.

00:18:36.967 --> 00:18:38.867
You'll recognize that unit.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:42.567
Except instead of being
kilograms per cubic meter,

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:48.200
it's micrograms. A microgram
is 10 to the

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.467
minus 6 of a gram.

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:55.733
So that's a pretty small mass
density, but that is again a

00:18:55.733 --> 00:18:58.700
quantity that you are used
to dealing with.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.467
So I want you to
remember that.

00:19:00.467 --> 00:19:03.433
I'll do some calculations for
you on the next slide.

00:19:03.433 --> 00:19:06.533
And we can do a similar check to
be sure that these numbers

00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:07.000
are consistent.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.567
So on the next slide, I'm going
to check to see if those

00:19:09.567 --> 00:19:12.700
two numbers are really the same
because we know how to do

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:15.567
those conversions
in this course.

00:19:15.567 --> 00:19:17.267
So a few ozone calculations.

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:22.533
First of all, you remember that
a mixing ratio by mass,

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:25.000
where you're using rho, which
is mass density in forming a

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.600
ratio, can be computed if you
know the mixing ratio by

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.867
volume, that is, by molecule,
by just multiplying by the

00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:40.267
ratio of the molecular weight,
which in this case is 48 for

00:19:40.267 --> 00:19:44.500
ozone and 29 for air.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.167
The mixing ratio that I gave you
on the last slide was 0.12

00:19:49.167 --> 00:19:53.600
parts per million by volume,
which can be written this way.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.567
And so I'm going to take this
equation and solve it for the

00:19:56.567 --> 00:19:58.933
mass density of ozone.

00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:01.967
So I'm simply going to bring the
rho AIR over to the other

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:05.533
side and plug in numbers, and
that's the line here.

00:20:05.533 --> 00:20:10.067
So you still have the ratio
of molecular weights.

00:20:10.067 --> 00:20:14.100
For the mixing ratio by volume,
I put it in here.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.500
And then I put in the density
for air, which is a standard

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.867
value we've been using for sea
level density all through the

00:20:20.867 --> 00:20:25.900
course, and that's about
1.2 kilograms per

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:29.067
cubic meter of air.

00:20:29.067 --> 00:20:31.667
And you can check to be sure
I've done this right.

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:36.867
But when I convert this to
micrograms per cubic meter, I

00:20:36.867 --> 00:20:43.500
get 235, which is just what
the EPA claimed was the

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:45.533
equivalent of that.

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:48.933
So that's how you can go back
and forth between these

00:20:48.933 --> 00:20:53.600
different measures of
ozone concentration.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.867
Any questions on that?

00:20:58.767 --> 00:20:59.900
Let's do one other.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:05.267
Let's compute the partial
pressure of ozone using the

00:21:05.267 --> 00:21:07.133
Perfect Gas Law.

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:08.900
Pressure equals rho RT.

00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:14.900
It's the partial pressure of
ozone we're computing, so it's

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.500
going to be the mass density of
ozone we're using, the gas

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:22.400
constant for ozone and then the
temperature, whatever that

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.000
is, but it has to
be in Kelvin.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
The gas constant for ozone is
the universal gas constant

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.500
divided by the molecular
weight.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:32.133
That's 48, so it's 173.2.

00:21:32.133 --> 00:21:33.767
And then let's just put
the numbers in here.

00:21:33.767 --> 00:21:39.200
From the previous slide, 235.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.500
I've converted this to
kilograms, though, so we get a

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.533
10 to the minus 9 in there.

00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:45.900
There comes the gas constant
for ozone.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:51.100
And I've used a typical Earth
temperature of 288, and I get

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.667
12 milliPascals for that.

00:21:56.667 --> 00:22:03.400
So if the EPA had wanted to
express that limit in partial

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.367
pressure, that's the value
they could have used.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:12.367
So we've seen three different
ways that you can express this

00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:15.733
concentration of ozone.

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:19.533
Let me go back to the plot.

00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:21.833
This was in milliPascals.

00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:25.633
And this author had it about 5,
but the value we computed

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:29.633
is right about there, which is
the same order of magnitude in

00:22:29.633 --> 00:22:30.867
units of millipascals.

00:22:34.067 --> 00:22:38.567
OK, so who is in exceedance
of this?

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:41.467
And this gives you
a rough idea.

00:22:41.467 --> 00:22:45.300
Now, this happens to be an
eight-hour ground-level ozone

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:51.700
standard based on 0.06
or 0.07 ppmv.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.500
And they've got different
levels here.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.867
515 counties violate
the 0.07 standard.

00:22:59.867 --> 00:23:06.467
93 additional counties violate
a 0.065 standard, and 42

00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:11.133
additional counties
violate the 0.06.

00:23:11.133 --> 00:23:13.733
But anyway, you see roughly
where they are.

00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:15.433
Some are in Florida.

00:23:15.433 --> 00:23:17.433
Those who are going to go
on vacation in Florida,

00:23:17.433 --> 00:23:20.133
watch out for this.

00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:22.633
It's mostly a summertime
problem, but it's still kind

00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:26.433
of summery in Florida.

00:23:26.433 --> 00:23:28.833
Quite a bigger problem in the
Northeast, and then, of

00:23:28.833 --> 00:23:34.100
course, California happens to be
the worst for a combination

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.467
of reasons large population,
dense population, especially

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:40.533
in the cities.

00:23:40.533 --> 00:23:43.833
There's a strong inversion
that typically traps

00:23:43.833 --> 00:23:46.333
pollutants in Southern
California.

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:49.567
You've got mountains, which can
often trap the pollutants

00:23:49.567 --> 00:23:50.867
from moving horizontally.

00:23:50.867 --> 00:23:55.633
So it's a combination of things
that brings and you

00:23:55.633 --> 00:23:57.900
have a lot of sunlight which
can help with the

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:02.333
conversion to ozone.

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:05.733
So that's roughly how the
exceedances are scattered

00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:06.967
around the country.

00:24:09.367 --> 00:24:12.733
The damage, of course, comes
when you breathe this in.

00:24:12.733 --> 00:24:18.067
It will then attack your throat,
trachea, and lungs.

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:25.500
Basically, it oxidizes organic
tissue, which can really cause

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:29.367
some breathing problems for some
people are more sensitive

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:30.467
than others.

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:32.567
But we can all be influenced
by this.

00:24:32.567 --> 00:24:35.167
And therefore, if you're an
athlete, if you're a runner or

00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:38.633
something, usually you will
keep yourself aware of the

00:24:38.633 --> 00:24:43.367
ozone concentrations and not do
outdoor activities during

00:24:43.367 --> 00:24:46.200
periods of time when there's
a high ozone concentration.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:51.367
Indoor should be OK, because
usually, ozone concentrations

00:24:51.367 --> 00:24:54.633
inside a building are
not a problem.

00:24:54.633 --> 00:24:58.200
The ozone will react with things
in the walls, destroy

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.100
itself, and you don't usually
have much of a problem with

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.600
ozone inside a building.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.433
But outside you can, and you'll
want to adjust your

00:25:06.433 --> 00:25:10.400
athletic activities
accordingly.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.333
So now, let's look at the
sequence of events that leads

00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:16.633
to ozone pollution.

00:25:16.633 --> 00:25:20.167
I've taken some slides here
from a nice book by Turco,

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:22.300
Earth Under Siege.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:25.633
So here's a little
Volkswagen Bug or

00:25:25.633 --> 00:25:27.833
something, perking along.

00:25:27.833 --> 00:25:32.400
And what's coming out of the
tailpipe is primarily oxides

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.433
of nitrogen, reactive

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:39.033
hydrocarbons, and carbon
monoxide.

00:25:39.033 --> 00:25:42.600
We're going to call those
primary pollutants because

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.767
they are being emitted
directly by

00:25:45.767 --> 00:25:49.033
the offending vehicle.

00:25:49.033 --> 00:25:52.033
In addition, you've
got the sun.

00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:54.667
With ultraviolet radiation, some
chemical reactions are

00:25:54.667 --> 00:26:00.367
going to take place to
convert--to produce NO2, some

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:03.467
additional hydrocarbons, and
then later in the day, we're

00:26:03.467 --> 00:26:04.867
going to start to
generate these.

00:26:04.867 --> 00:26:07.667
But we still have the carbon
monoxide, but now, we're

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:11.933
getting ozone, PAN, which I'll
define in a minute, and that

00:26:11.933 --> 00:26:15.433
haze that you see when you look
at the pictures of these

00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:17.433
polluted areas.

00:26:17.433 --> 00:26:20.867
But this takes some
hours to produce.

00:26:20.867 --> 00:26:25.067
And so this would as I'll show
you, this sort of thing would

00:26:25.067 --> 00:26:29.800
typically peak in the middle
afternoon after some chemical

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:34.567
reactions have converted the
primary pollutants to these

00:26:34.567 --> 00:26:37.067
that we call secondary
pollutants.

00:26:37.067 --> 00:26:41.567
I'm going to walk through these
a bit step by step.

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:48.533
First of all, the vehicle
itself will emit these

00:26:48.533 --> 00:26:52.133
quantities, depending
on how it's tuned.

00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:55.600
So here's an example
fuel-to-air

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.867
stoichiometric ratio.

00:26:56.867 --> 00:27:00.400
So in the old days, you actually
had a control on the

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.000
dashboard where you could lean
the mixture or enrich the

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.600
mixture, that is, how much gas
goes in per amount of air into

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.467
the cylinder.

00:27:10.467 --> 00:27:13.233
Now that's all done
automatically by a computer,

00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:16.400
but still it's an important
quantity.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.800
So the fuel to air ratio
is given here.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.433
And you really--you can't
perfectly win this, because if

00:27:23.433 --> 00:27:28.967
you try to go for minimum carbon
monoxide emissions,

00:27:28.967 --> 00:27:32.633
well, then you're getting more
nitrogen oxides and so on.

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:36.100
But you can see how the relative
quantities of this

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.700
may change.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:40.100
And you're trying to find some
kind of optimum by getting the

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.367
proper fuel-to-air
stoichiometric ratio.

00:27:44.367 --> 00:27:48.400
And engines have improved
greatly in this regard, and

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.800
the catalytic converters
have helped also.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:58.567
So then if you are to set up a
monitoring station this was

00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:02.167
done in Lennox in the
Los Angeles Basin.

00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:04.467
I don't know where Lennox is.

00:28:04.467 --> 00:28:07.300
Anybody from LA?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:12.267
Must be some little suburb or
something of Los Angeles.

00:28:12.267 --> 00:28:16.067
What's plotted here is the
carbon monoxide concentration

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:19.000
parts per million by volume
for both plots.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.500
This goes through a typical day,
a 24-hour day period, and

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.300
this goes through
a typical year.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.533
And in addition, they've
got a summer and a

00:28:28.533 --> 00:28:29.067
winter curve here.

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:33.800
So we can see immediately that
for CO, there's more of a

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:36.500
problem in the winter
than the summer.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.933
And we see that here, too,
because November, December,

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:44.467
January have higher
CO2 concentrations

00:28:44.467 --> 00:28:46.433
than does the summer.

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:51.967
We also see on the 24-hour
clock, we see two peaks.

00:28:51.967 --> 00:28:55.067
What are those two
peaks caused by?

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:55.933
STUDENT: Rush hour.

00:28:55.933 --> 00:28:57.267
PROFESSOR: Rush hour, exactly.

00:28:57.267 --> 00:29:02.067
So this is primarily automobile
emissions, and this

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:03.567
is a primary pollutant.

00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:07.500
This was actually coming out of
the tailpipe, so it reacts

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.833
to the timing of the morning and
the afternoon rush hour,

00:29:11.833 --> 00:29:13.400
so you can actually see that.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:19.367
Now, what makes the winter worse
than the summer, I'm

00:29:19.367 --> 00:29:23.833
guessing, has to do with having
a stronger inversion in

00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:26.133
the wintertime.

00:29:26.133 --> 00:29:30.000
And that will cause more
trapping of the air, and the

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.033
concentrations will build up to
be somewhat greater in the

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:35.100
winter than they do
in the summer.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:40.200
So this is an example of
a primary pollutant.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.300
Question on that?

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:46.433
Let's go on and look at NO2.

00:29:46.433 --> 00:29:50.967
And generally, you can still
see that twice-a-day peak.

00:29:50.967 --> 00:29:52.633
It's a little bit weaker.

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:57.033
There's less of a difference
between winter and summer,

00:29:57.033 --> 00:29:58.667
because now you've got
a combination of

00:29:58.667 --> 00:29:59.967
things going on.

00:29:59.967 --> 00:30:04.967
You needed some warmth, which
you have in the summer, to

00:30:04.967 --> 00:30:07.800
convert NO to NO2.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.733
And you need sunlight as well.

00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:13.000
But then in summer, you have
a weaker inversion.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.433
So the two things kind of
cancel to give you more

00:30:16.433 --> 00:30:21.000
similar behavior between
winter and summer

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.400
when it comes NO2.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.300
And now we'll do ozone, which is
really the thing we're most

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.800
concerned about.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.867
Ozone looks quite different
than the other.

00:30:32.867 --> 00:30:42.733
Now, it has a summertime maximum
and a mid afternoon,

00:30:42.733 --> 00:30:46.900
so that peaks around 1 or 2 or
3 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:51.367
So we're not seeing the rush
hour here because those

00:30:51.367 --> 00:30:57.733
primary pollutants hang around
for several hours as chemical

00:30:57.733 --> 00:31:00.733
reactions driven by the sun and
driven by the temperature

00:31:00.733 --> 00:31:05.633
convert them to the
ozone product.

00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:09.233
And therefore, this is more
dependent on those chemical

00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:13.500
conversion reactions than on
the timing of the emissions

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:16.967
themselves from the
rush hour traffic.

00:31:16.967 --> 00:31:20.467
And look how peaked in
the summer it is.

00:31:20.467 --> 00:31:24.267
That means that again this
conversion is the big deal,

00:31:24.267 --> 00:31:27.300
not the trapping by the--

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.367
I say it wrong?

00:31:28.367 --> 00:31:30.833
Not the inversion so much,
which is stronger in the

00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:34.567
wintertime, but rather the
conversion from primary to

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:38.067
secondary pollutants are
controlling the summertime

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:40.033
maximum here.

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:43.800
So if you're an athlete, and
you get up in the morning,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:44.933
that's great.

00:31:44.933 --> 00:31:50.267
Do your run right then before,
say, 8 or 9 o'clock.

00:31:50.267 --> 00:31:52.567
If you're too lazy to get up
that early, then I think you'd

00:31:52.567 --> 00:31:58.133
better skip it until you get to
around, well, 8 o'clock in

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:01.167
the evening, something like
this, or even 9 o'clock.

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:02.067
Then go out and do your run.

00:32:02.067 --> 00:32:05.733
Otherwise, do your exercise
inside if you're in one of

00:32:05.733 --> 00:32:09.200
these locations.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.433
Questions on this?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.967
So this summarizes a
little bit of that.

00:32:19.967 --> 00:32:22.767
The primary pollutants
tend to peak in the

00:32:22.767 --> 00:32:24.233
early part of the day.

00:32:24.233 --> 00:32:27.000
The secondary pollutions peak
in the later part of the day

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.900
because of the time for
those conversion

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.200
reactions to take place.

00:32:35.567 --> 00:32:38.433
So an important part of the
argument that I just gave you

00:32:38.433 --> 00:32:42.733
was this distinction between
primary pollutants and

00:32:42.733 --> 00:32:43.767
secondary pollutants.

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:45.033
Primary pollutants are the ones

00:32:45.033 --> 00:32:47.267
that are emitted directly.

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:49.733
Secondary pollutants are the
ones that are produced later

00:32:49.733 --> 00:32:54.800
on by chemical reactions going
on in the Earth's atmosphere.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.733
So be sure you've got
a clear distinction

00:32:57.733 --> 00:32:59.700
between those two things.

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.367
Now, this has been
well studied.

00:33:09.367 --> 00:33:15.200
And this rather clever diagram
was published a couple of

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:22.567
decades ago that has been very
helpful in allowing city

00:33:22.567 --> 00:33:27.000
managers to reduce ozone
concentrations.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.200
So what's plotted on this
diagram, on the x-axis is the

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.367
emitted reactive hydrocarbons.

00:33:35.367 --> 00:33:41.367
On the y-axis are the emitted
oxides of nitrogen.

00:33:41.367 --> 00:33:47.267
Both units are kilograms
per square kilometer.

00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:49.167
I don't know what the time
frame on that is.

00:33:49.167 --> 00:33:53.733
Perhaps it's per day
or per year.

00:33:53.733 --> 00:33:55.933
I don't know.

00:33:55.933 --> 00:34:01.500
And then contoured on here
is the resultant ozone

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:05.667
concentration in the same units
we've been using, parts

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:07.200
per million by volume.

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:13.500
So you'll recognize that as the
one-hour standard, that

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:20.000
curve there, and that as the
12-hour standard from the--

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.233
from the EPA.

00:34:21.233 --> 00:34:27.067
So basically, we want our city
or town to be somewhere in the

00:34:27.067 --> 00:34:31.667
periphery of this diagram,
not in this high ozone

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:34.833
concentration in the
upper right.

00:34:34.833 --> 00:34:37.433
What this diagram shows you is
that you've got two different

00:34:37.433 --> 00:34:39.900
control strategies.

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.867
You can reduce the number of
NOx emissions, which will

00:34:43.867 --> 00:34:47.033
bring you down on the curve, or
you can reduce the amount

00:34:47.033 --> 00:34:49.733
of hydrocarbon emissions, which
will bring you to the

00:34:49.733 --> 00:34:50.467
left of the curve.

00:34:50.467 --> 00:34:55.800
Now, if you are here, it's not
going to do you much good to

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.167
reduce the hydrocarbon emissions
because you're going

00:34:58.167 --> 00:35:00.900
to move that way on the curve,
and you're going to have about

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.200
the same ozone concentrations.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.000
But if you reduce NOx emissions,
you can bring

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.800
yourself down to a lower
ozone concentration.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.267
Conversely, if you're over here,
your strategy should

00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:18.933
involve hydrocarbon emissions,
not so much NO emissions.

00:35:18.933 --> 00:35:23.900
So this is a kind of a road
map for air pollution

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.900
districts to figure out where
to put their effort in

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.000
reducing emissions.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.233
Questions on this?

00:35:38.933 --> 00:35:41.833
But they've been doing this.

00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:45.233
This is I think for LA, but it's
in relative units, so I

00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:46.833
can't say much about
the units here.

00:35:46.833 --> 00:35:51.333
But it's 1965 to about 2005,
and you see the carbon

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:53.967
monoxide emissions have
been decreasing.

00:35:53.967 --> 00:35:57.667
The volatile organic compounds
have been decreasing, and the

00:35:57.667 --> 00:35:58.733
NOx have been increasing.

00:35:58.733 --> 00:36:03.267
So these cities have worked
very hard to reduce the

00:36:03.267 --> 00:36:06.667
sources of this, both from
automobiles and from other

00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:09.700
industrial sources.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.700
Here in Connecticut,
for example,

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.900
we've had some success.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.267
This is the Connecticut one-hour
and eight-hour ozone

00:36:17.267 --> 00:36:21.867
exceedances in units of days.

00:36:21.867 --> 00:36:27.367
So how many days a year do you
have an ozone exceedance?

00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:29.900
The data goes back to 1974.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.967
At that point, they only
had the which one

00:36:32.967 --> 00:36:33.800
is the lower one?

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.433
That would be the

00:36:35.433 --> 00:36:36.400
STUDENT: One hour.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.167
PROFESSOR: The one hour.

00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:40.733
Yeah, the one-hour exceedance.

00:36:40.733 --> 00:36:42.800
And that was about if I average
this out, that was

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.333
about 50 days a year where you'd
have an ozone exceedance

00:36:47.333 --> 00:36:49.567
in Connecticut.

00:36:49.567 --> 00:36:54.500
This data ends in 2004, but they
were down to about five

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.367
on average, about five days
per year with an ozone

00:36:58.367 --> 00:36:59.467
exceedance.

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:01.900
Now, they had the eight-hour
exceedance, where

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.567
you get more typically.

00:37:03.567 --> 00:37:05.867
Although it's an average over
a longer period of time, it

00:37:05.867 --> 00:37:10.867
has a lower threshold, so you
get more exceedances.

00:37:10.867 --> 00:37:16.267
But that, too, has dropped over
time because of pollution

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:19.667
controls on the primary
pollutants.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.267
Questions on that?

00:37:24.267 --> 00:37:27.767
So this can be done and has been
done, but you know, it

00:37:27.767 --> 00:37:32.067
could be better as well.

00:37:32.067 --> 00:37:34.967
So that is that.

00:37:34.967 --> 00:37:36.967
I don't usually end
this early, but I

00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:37.800
think I will today.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:42.733
So next time we will do the
other ozone problem.

00:37:42.733 --> 00:37:45.400
We'll do the stratospheric
ozone problem.

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.533
So there is a little section on
your book on this, so read

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:49.800
ahead for that one.

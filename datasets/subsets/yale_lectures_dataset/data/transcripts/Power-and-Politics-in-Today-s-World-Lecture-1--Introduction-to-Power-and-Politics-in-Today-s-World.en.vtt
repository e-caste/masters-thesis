00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.720
- Hello everybody and welcome.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.333
How is everybody today?

00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:14.320
Great.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.860
Well, I'm delighted to
have the opportunity

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.780
to be giving the DeVane Lectures.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.640
And the DeVane Lectures, as you can tell,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.470
from looking around you double as being

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.780
a regular Yale course for credit

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.700
that students can take for credit

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.373
and lectures that are open
to the general public.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.440
These lectures are going to
deal with power and politics

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.900
in today's world and by today's world,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm gonna mean the 30 years since 1989

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.950
and the 30 years since 1989 are

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.953
and have been an incredibly
tumultuous period

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.350
of very great change.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.433
And that's for xxx unusual.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.440
For instance, if you compare
it to the previous 40 years

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.250
in most of the advanced
capitalist democracies,

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.410
they were a period of relative stability

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.920
after World War II.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.050
In most countries, it was
an era of great prosperity

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.190
even countries recovering
from World War II

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.610
like the countries of
Europe were being rebuilt

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.940
with Marshal Plan aid and it was a period,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.770
partly for demographic reasons,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580
of very great political stability

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.850
for people who grew up in that period.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.960
Internationally, as well, it was a period

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.707
of very great stability because partly,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950
because of the Cold War.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.650
It's true we had episodes
like the Cuban Missile Crisis

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.260
and the Vietnam War but as
the Vietnam War indicates,

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.720
most of the conflicts within the Cold War

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.720
were played out as you like, as proxy wars

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.720
in other parts of the world.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.390
From the point of view of the citizens

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.270
of the Western democracies,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.050
except for those who are
actually fighting in Vietnam,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.550
it was a far-off war that
didn't have a great impact

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.170
on the stability of people's lives

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.370
and that is very different
from what has been experienced

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.380
since 1989; time, if you like,
has speeded up a great deal.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.160
We've seen incredible
change in three decades.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960
And those are the three decades

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.633
that I am going to be exploring.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.010
One pedagogical challenge that presents

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.890
is that for some of us in this room,

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.900
the last three decades
are etched into our minds

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.240
as like it was yesterday.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.470
We experienced them in real time

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.420
but there are many people in this room

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.420
who were never born until long after that.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.420
For them, whether it's the last 40 years

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.420
or the last 60 years,
40 years or the 60 years

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.203
after World War II, it's all history.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.130
One of the first things I need to do

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.330
and I'm gonna try and make
this a regular practice

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.660
during the course is I
need to take everybody back

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.230
and to make people
understand who weren't there

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.160
what it was like and then to remind people

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.791
who've lived through it of things

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:51.880
that they might have forgotten.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.880
So let's just go back to 1989 in Berlin.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.910
- The Berlin Wall, once
it divided East from West,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.285
now on its way to becoming
an artifact of history.

00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:07.990
(upbeat music)

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.430
This the CBS Evening News.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.300
Dan Rather, reporting
tonight from in front

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.940
of the Brandenburg Gate
in Berlin, Germany.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.010
Good evening.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.870
These are the sights and sounds

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.070
of the continuing celebration of Germans

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.050
about the symbolic, not the
literal, at least, not yet

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.370
but the symbolic tearing
down of the Berlin Wall.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.960
It's impossible to completely describe

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.083
how deeply Germans feel
about what's happened here.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.420
East German border guards tonight

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.580
were literally tearing down
portions of the wall itself,

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.880
not the whole wall but
portions of the wall

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.900
to make it easier for East
Germans to come into West Berlin

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.670
and as the joyous hordes of Berliners

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.640
were still streaming through the wall,

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.600
the East German communist government said

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.450
they can come and go permanently,

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.350
they can come into West
Berlin, have a look

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.120
and then come back home again

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.450
with no special documents required.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.440
Today, what goes through
your mind and heart?

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.550
- Well, of course, I look
back to all those years

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.440
of hardship for the
families even more than

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.240
for the country as a whole and it's moving

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.270
to see families getting together again.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.530
My feeling is that we are very close

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.420
to an end of the artificial
division of Berlin

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.760
and I also believe we
are close to the point

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.760
where the parts of Germany will
become much closer together.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:31.683
This, of course,

00:05:31.683 --> 00:05:34.523
only within the reasonable
European framework.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.783
Anyone know who that was?

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.940
Xxx Billy Braun, the former
Chancellor of Germany

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.670
who actually would die a couple of years,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.640
three years after that,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.640
so he was one of the
celebratory crowd at that time.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.590
So that might give you a
little sense of the shock

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.860
and the enthusiasm that people experienced

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.680
in the latter days of 1989.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.590
This had been a period
in which the Soviet Union

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.520
was clearly losing its
grip on Eastern Europe.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.073
It wasn't just Germany.

00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:19.073
Right across Eastern
Europe, all through 1989,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.750
there had been these massive
resistance movements developing

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.660
and the Soviet Union was losing,

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.500
it was clearly not in
a position to intervene

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.850
in these countries.

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.850
And they were shedding
totalitarian control

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.253
for the first time in decades.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.700
Of course, the great exception

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.720
which we will be talking
about next week was in China

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.720
where demonstrations in Tiananmen Square

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.300
that June had come out,
meant a very different result

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.950
but in most of the world, after 1989,

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.870
it seemed like democracy was on the March.

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.520
We saw the democratization of all

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.520
of the former Soviet Union bloc
countries in Eastern Europe

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.080
even places like South
Africa which had been mired

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:27.250
in a bitter conflict for
decades transitioned in

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.310
the early 1990s to a
multi-racial democracy.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.770
The problems in Northern
Ireland finally settled

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.710
with the Good Friday Accords in 1997.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.860
Even Israel-Palestine which had been one

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.860
of the most intractable
conflicts for decades and decades

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.500
seemed to be moving towards a
resolution in the early 1990s.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.227
There were the Oslo Accords, the PLO

00:08:01.227 --> 00:08:05.810
and the Israeli government
were negotiating a settlement.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.870
Anyone who was in Israel or the West Bank

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:11.650
at that time anticipated
that there was going

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.010
to be a settlement until the assassination

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.540
of one of the key
protagonists, Yitzhak Rabin

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.430
in November of 1995.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:25.840
And that would lead to an unraveling

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.793
of that potential settlement
but in the early 1990s,

00:08:29.707 --> 00:08:33.460
it's really I think difficult to overstate

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.570
the enthusiasm for change.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.880
This is the period when Francis Fukuyama

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.100
was talking about the end of history

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.690
by which he meant that liberal democracy

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.310
was sweeping the world.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.830
In fact, at the turn of the 21st century,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.040
we finally went from a world
in which most countries

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.840
in the world were not democracies
by most standard measures

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:01.640
to a world in which most
countries were democracies

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.120
by most standard measures.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.120
So it's not surprising that
one would have had the kind

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.860
of enthusiasm that
Fukuyama had at that time

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.013
and that was almost,

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:21.610
what's the word?

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.450
Just snowballing across so
much of the developed world.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.040
Enormous confidence in
democratic capitalism

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.900
and enormous confidence in the idea

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.720
that many people were gonna
be lifted out of poverty

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.370
and that the world was heading

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:42.290
for a kind of benign equilibrium,

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:47.290
as an economist would say,
Fukuyama's end of history idea.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.930
now let's fast-forward three decades

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:57.930
and let's stay in Germany and
here's a very different thing

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.900
to look at.

00:10:06.381 --> 00:10:08.270
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.045
(audience cheering)

00:10:11.045 --> 00:10:14.962
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.000
So he's a leader of the
Alternative for Deutschland,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.370
far-right anti-immigrant,

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.370
anti-system political party
and what he is celebrating

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:09.993
is that they have
crossed the 5% threshold.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.630
This is the AFP here on this graph.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.690
Germany has a 5% threshold to get seated

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:20.430
in the parliament so if you
don't get 5%, you get no seats,

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.430
they hadn't gotten 5% before
and now they had won 5%

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.220
and so they saw themselves
as getting a foothold

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.633
in German electoral
politics for the first time.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.187
Germany, in 2017 was
coming out of a situation

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.140
in which there had been a grand coalition

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:47.420
between the SPD which is the left

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.420
of said Social Democratic Party
and the right of center CDU,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.759
Christian Democratic Party
led by Angela Merkel.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.140
And the SPD were very unhappy,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.200
they had been in this grand
coalition for a long time

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.630
and they found that they
were paying a huge price

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:09.170
with their supporters.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.900
They were getting less
and less of the vote

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.540
for reasons we'll talk
about later in the course

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:17.370
and they announced that they
were not gonna participate

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.690
in a grand coalition again
and they were gonna go

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.033
into opposition and rebuild themselves.

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:28.803
Angela Merkel then spent
the next six months,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:33.890
Alternative for Deutschland were and still

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.260
are seen as beyond the pale,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.493
nobody will form a government with them.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.780
So she spent the next six months trying

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.430
to put together a coalition

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.010
with the Green Environmentalist Party

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.670
and the so-called Free Democrats.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:53.370
The Free Democrats would be
what we would think of as,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.410
in this country, as
Rand Paul libertarians.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.280
They are for small
government, low regulation

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.522
across the board.

00:13:02.522 --> 00:13:06.743
It's not surprising
that she couldn't do it

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.010
because the greens want green regulation.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.580
They want environmental regulation.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.720
That's their raison d'etre
and the Free Democrats

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.990
want no regulation or
certainly, less regulation.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.990
So they stumbled along in
and out of negotiations

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.513
but they weren't able to form a coalition.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:32.370
However, over the course
of that six months,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.370
all the opinion polls showed that the AFD,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.110
the Alternative for Deutschland

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.990
was actually rising in popularity.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.740
And so the German
president was very against

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.570
having another election in
the face of the stalemate

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.360
with the Social Democrats refusing

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.840
to join in a grand
coalition on the one hand

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.930
and Merkel's inability to construct

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:01.380
a different coalition on the other.

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:04.780
They all knew that if they
went for another election,

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.323
the AFD would do even better.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.853
So finally, after much hand-wringing,

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.830
the SPD was persuaded after extracting

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:22.830
a very big set of concessions,
including six ministries

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.950
and the Finance Ministry.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:28.560
They were persuaded to go
back into a grand coalition

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.630
even though a lot of their
membership didn't want it.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:35.450
So terrified were they of the
prospect of another election

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:39.353
in which the far right
would do even better.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.830
So we thought German politics
was kind of settling down

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.100
at this point but the following year,

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.883
this is what you see happening.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.270
- [Presnter] German
Chancellor, Angela Merkel,

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.560
who's led Germany for 13
years has offered to step down

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.060
as her party's leader
and said she won't run

00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:02.270
for office again after
her term ends in 2021.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.380
Her announcement came
a day after her party,

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.160
the Christian Democratic Union,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.310
saw a disappointing performance
in a key regional election

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:11.940
in the state of Hesse.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.000
The far-right, Alternative
for Germany party

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.360
claimed more than a dozen
seats in Hesse's Parliament

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.640
for the first time.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.840
The entire migrant
party now controls seats

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.020
in all 16 of Germany's state Parliament's

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.163
plus the National Bundestag
and European Parliament.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.354
- So there it is.

00:15:28.354 --> 00:15:30.830
They had also done very poorly

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.383
in the Bavarian regional elections.

00:15:33.383 --> 00:15:37.970
They had hemorrhaged about
10% of their vote to the AFD

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:40.610
in these regional
elections and by the way,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.580
the SPD wasn't very happy either

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.203
because they were hemorrhaging
support to the greens.

00:15:48.351 --> 00:15:50.570
And this is something
we'll see playing out

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.470
in many European countries.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.530
The establishment parties are
shrinking and becoming weaker

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:59.400
and the parties on the fringes are growing

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.530
and becoming stronger.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.460
And it was impossible
not to start thinking

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.200
about the past and thinking particularly

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.035
about the 1920s and 30s.

00:16:11.035 --> 00:16:14.952
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.280
- [Presenter] As a result of
the elections of July, 1932,

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:38.750
the Nazis became the
biggest party in Germany

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.463
with 37% of the vote.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:46.500
- So if you wanna go back to the 1930s,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.500
you can see that that video was
about the July 1932 election

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:57.040
and you can see what happened
in the subsequent elections

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.990
that it was a very unstable system.

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:03.340
They were having multiple
elections and of course,

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.750
18 months later, Hitler came to power.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.810
And if you go to Germany,

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:14.706
you hear very anxious people talking about

00:17:14.706 --> 00:17:16.640
is this back to the future?

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.640
Is 2017 and 2018 some kind
of replay of the empowerment

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.790
of extremist parties and of course,

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.520
it wasn't just Germany.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.780
In 2016 we had massive shocks delivered

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.920
to establishment parties
with the Brexit result

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.140
in the UK and Donald
Trump's populist stampede

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.770
to the presidency in the US,

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:49.250
both widely unanticipated outcomes by most

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:54.100
of the establishment parties,
pundits and politicians.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.860
And you could go around the world.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.870
In the Austrian elections of 2016,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.890
people are very relieved
that in the runoff,

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.700
the Green candidate actually
defeated the far-right

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.420
quite handsomely by 54 to 46%

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.100
but if you look at the legislature,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.383
again, you see the
far-right gaining ground,

00:18:15.383 --> 00:18:19.860
the establishment parties
coming in fourth and fifth

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.640
in the 2017 legislative elections.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.260
These are the parties that would normally

00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.060
have come in first and second

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.143
while the far-right
party increased its vote,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.700
putting them a close third with 51 seats,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:40.540
while the Greens fell below
the threshold and won nothing

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.540
or if you look at Belgium,
you see a center-right party

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.390
retains its majority but if
you drill down a little bit,

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:54.080
you can see that there
was an increase of support

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.820
for the far-right Flemish Vlaams Belang

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.773
which received almost 12%
of the vote gaining seats.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.860
If you look at Italy, you can see

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:09.860
the center-left party ceding
power to the center-right

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.770
but many of the votes for
the center-right party

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:16.180
are coming from the league, so-called,

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.280
again, a far right-wing populist party

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.030
which ends up with 125 seats

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:27.143
and 17% of the popular vote, of 109 seats

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.960
and I could put up another
seven or eight or nine slides

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.520
of different countries that
basically tell the same stories

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.460
in country after country across Europe

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.080
both Eastern Europe and Western Europe,

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.060
including countries that
we thought of as bastions

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.040
of civil social democratic
stability like Sweden.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.900
You see these far-right
parties doing well,

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.370
Turkey, Latin America, elsewhere,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:01.590
where anti-establishment
parties that sometimes

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.310
also verge on being anti-system parties

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:11.100
are gaining ground in many legislatures.

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.720
So if you think about the contrast

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.350
between the videos of
1989 and where the world

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:23.350
has been since 2016, it
couldn't be more dramatic

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.640
and in some ways, it's a big downer

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.293
but my first thing I wanna say
is don't get too depressed.

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.963
It's not all of course, for depression.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.443
The central questions of
this course are three.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:46.013
How did we get from there to here?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.653
What are the challenges and
prospects going forward?

00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:55.340
And most importantly, in
the last part of the course,

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.670
how could we get to a better place

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:01.710
in many of the countries
that we're talking about?

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:03.480
We'll spend a lot of time on the US

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.483
but not exclusively in the US.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.230
I should say a little bit
about the distinctive approach

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.193
that I'm gonna be taking
in these lectures,

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.840
not to say it's the best approach;

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.300
there are many ways to look
at this kind of material

00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:24.013
but it is the approach
that I'm going to be using.

00:21:25.028 --> 00:21:28.130
And the first thing I would
say about this approach

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:31.970
is that I'm going to be studying history

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.900
with the tools of political science

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.470
and political theory on the one hand

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.240
but also using history
to keep political science

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.693
and political theory honest.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.920
So what do I mean by that?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.920
Well, one thing that is remarkable
about the events of 1989

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.640
is that they supply us with
a terrific natural experiment

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:04.640
from the point of view
of social scientists.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.920
If you look at the
literature, for example,

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:11.020
of people who studied
European democracies,

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.580
before 1989, they were essentially
cycling endless numbers

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.750
of theories through the same old data set

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.630
that everybody had had for four decades.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:26.630
And they didn't have any
a big exogenous change.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:31.060
1989 is a big shock to
the system and suddenly,

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.457
we have, for instance, in Western Europe,

00:22:33.457 --> 00:22:36.100
in Eastern Europe, the addition

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.360
of a whole lot of new
parliamentary democracies.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:44.070
That creates possibilities of thinking

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.930
about long-established
conventional wisdom,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.490
testing theories against new data

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.710
which is the gold standard
for social science

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.420
rather than testing theories on data

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.380
out of which the theories
have been developed,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.420
which tend to result in
what statisticians call

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:08.670
just-so stories, fitting
the curve to the data.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.230
Suddenly we have all this new data,

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.453
coming along in real time.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.590
If you think about and
we're gonna talk some about

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.410
some of the standard
theories in political science

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.360
like modernization
theory, which is a theory

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.300
about how as economies modify,

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:32.133
certain kinds of political
changes become more likely.

00:23:33.197 --> 00:23:36.523
It was long held that
modernization produces democracy.

00:23:37.508 --> 00:23:40.750
There were many variants
of modernization theory.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:44.550
And we will talk about some
of the differences among them

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.584
but now we have new data and
whether modernizing economies

00:23:48.584 --> 00:23:50.763
will produce democracy.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.640
It is long been conventional
wisdom that democratic systems

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.620
are incompatible with state-run economies.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:02.093
If we look at what's happened since 1989,

00:24:03.535 --> 00:24:05.630
we've gone to market economies

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.750
in some of the post-communist
systems but others

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:13.750
like China and Vietnam have
become state capitalist systems

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.720
of a certain kind while retaining
non democratic politics.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.930
So we'll have cause to
think about theories

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.433
of that general sort.

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:30.337
There's been a lot of conventional wisdom

00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:34.320
about the conditions for stable democracy

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.900
that suddenly can be put to the test

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.500
on a whole slew of new democracies.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.710
Is it all the economy stupid

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:45.950
or do beliefs of citizens matter?

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.510
And what kinds of beliefs matter

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.613
and what about the beliefs of elites?

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:54.480
All of these things, we can look at again,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.520
in new contexts.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.420
So we have lots of new
data to think about them,

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.420
provided by this dramatic break of 1989.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.730
There's a lot of conventional wisdom

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.610
about the relations between
business, government

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.440
and labor that has built up
among political economists

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.410
and political scientists
over the last several decades

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.870
before 1989.

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:27.870
We now have big power shifts
partly because communism

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:32.500
as an economic system has
been taken off the table.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.610
Well if communism, as an economic system,

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:39.070
is taken off the table, how
does that restructure relations

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.853
between business government and labor?

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.970
It turns out it really has a big impact

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.700
on those relationships.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.283
So that's another of the
topics we will be looking at.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:58.890
How do electoral systems
affect things like inequality,

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:02.890
provision of environmental legislation

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.080
and public goods?

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.070
A lot of conventional wisdom there

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.130
about which types of
democracies are more likely

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.780
to do that and which are
less likely to do that

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:18.780
start to look before and after 1989

00:26:18.873 --> 00:26:20.210
and we're gonna discover

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:25.210
that some of the conventional
wisdom needs rethinking.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.160
So on the one hand
we're bringing the tools

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.060
of political science and the
theories of political science

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.970
to bear on the data that's thrown up

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.837
by this last 30 years of history.

00:26:39.837 --> 00:26:43.470
On the other hand, we're using that data

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:47.240
to keep the political scientists honest,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.240
precisely because we have
this whole smorgasbord

00:26:55.583 --> 00:26:59.910
of new results as a social
scientist would put it

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.750
but then I also said
I'm gonna use the tools

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.693
of political theory.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.940
So political theory, I should
confess, truth in advertising

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.940
by my first profession, if
extended is a profession

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:19.776
is I'm a political theorist.

00:27:19.776 --> 00:27:24.776
I cut my teeth in the world
of political philosophy.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.860
I'm in normative things
about what should happen,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.880
how the world should be organized,

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.943
rather than empirical work
on how it is organized.

00:27:37.154 --> 00:27:39.010
We are definitely gonna be thinking

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.390
about normative questions
here as well as we go along,

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.590
what should happen,
what might have happened

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.640
but the confession I need to
make about my home discipline

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.370
is that it reminds me of
the story about the fella

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.940
who goes up to a farmer in Donegal

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.650
and says how do I get to Dublin

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.130
and the answer that comes back is well,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:06.953
I wouldn't start from here, sonny.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:13.450
That is to say much of
political philosophy

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:18.300
develops theories that take no account

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:22.940
of where we actually
are and how the theories

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.200
that people argue about in the journals

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.760
and in the literature
actually could be implemented

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.240
in the world, if at all.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.640
And this spills over
into normative arguments

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.670
made by other scholars.

00:28:35.670 --> 00:28:39.750
Thomas Piketty in his book,

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:41.900
Capital in the Twenty-First Century,

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:46.900
argues for a 4% global wealth tax.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.980
Well, good luck with that.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.380
Who's gonna implement
a 4% global wealth tax.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:59.380
So when I think about normative questions,

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.340
it's gonna be from the perspective

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:06.750
of how might the goals
that we think are desirable

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.883
actually be achieved.

00:29:09.738 --> 00:29:12.250
I am going to spend, as we go along,

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:17.250
through the different topics
that we're gonna be discussing.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:20.810
I am gonna be focusing on paths not taken,

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:23.730
things that might have
been done differently

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:27.390
and here the sorts of things
I'm gonna be talking about

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.960
are things like NATO
expansion, after the collapse

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:38.523
of the Soviet Union, the NATO alliance,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.160
we'll talk about this next week

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.990
which was expanded over
the next several decades

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:46.730
to include most, eventually,

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.160
all of the former Soviet bloc countries

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.190
and there were overtures,

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:56.190
also to including former
Soviet states like Georgia and

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.120
several others.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.610
I'll, talk about this Ukraine,
Georgia and Ukraine were

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.400
both talking about,
joining NATO that part of

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:17.843
the reason the Soviet
Union invaded Ukraine.

00:30:20.245 --> 00:30:22.630
So we will talk about
whether there was a path

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.300
not taken at that time French
president Francois Mitterrand

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.730
thought that NATO should be shut down

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:31.100
at the end of the Cold War
it was a defensive alliance

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.510
that had lost its purpose.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.650
How realistic was that?

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:39.740
how might the world have been
different had that happened

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.680
we're going to be talking about

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.750
the Global War on Terror I

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.410
should in after 9/11 when,

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:52.470
we invaded first
Afghanistan and then Iraq.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.560
Was there another path

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.810
that would have been politically
viable that would have led

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.760
the world in a different direction.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.620
We will talk about the response to

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:07.670
the financial crisis
of 2008 in 2009, again

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.665
what were their possibilities that,

00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:15.665
were, ignored or overlooked
that might have been

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:21.480
both politically feasible
and more polished effective

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.870
in the sense of policy
and so that brings me

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.710
to underscore the third feature of

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.100
the approach that I am
going to take in this

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.960
course which is when you look at, people

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.770
who talk about public policy,

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:41.280
it tends either to be
policy wonks who just go on

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.020
about what would be, the best policy

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.520
or political scientists who talk about

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.800
why some policies get adopted in some

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.490
systems and not in other systems

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.660
but there's very little discussion of what

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.200
is the effective political way of

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.300
achieving a good policy or

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.960
the effective political way of blocking

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.790
a bad policy and so when I
talk about innovations in

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.030
the last part of the
course, it's very much going

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:14.910
to be in a way that marries considerations

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.910
of politics to considerations
of good public policy

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.350
so, that that is the flavor

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:27.800
of what we're going to be doing here

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.800
and as I said it's not the
only way one might study

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.690
these materials ,but it's
the way that we're going

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.743
to be doing it in this course.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:41.893
Let me talk a little bit
about the shape of the course.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.720
It falls into five, sections.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.420
The the first one is going to starting

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.920
on Monday deal with the
collapse of communism

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:53.673
and its aftermath.

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.620
There we going to look
at collapse of communism

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:01.170
in Eastern Europe in Russia,

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:05.150
in China and in Vietnam.
Although I will talk

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:08.943
about some other countries along the way.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.730
We're going to talk about
the rise of a unipolar world,

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:17.743
until 1989, we had a
bipolar world in which,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.730
as I said a lot of actual stability,

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:22.563
that came about as a
byproduct of the Cold War

00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:26.900
at least among the the major powers

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.350
even if they maintained this stability,

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:34.040
partly by, acting out their conflicts

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.040
in proxy wars in, Asia, Africa and

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.340
at America but it by and large

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:46.340
the great powers were the
nucleus standoff worked

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.840
and we didn't have a major
conflict between them.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:55.360
Now we have gone to a
unipolar world dominated,

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.590
by a single power ,after 1989.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:02.450
How does that restructure politics and

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:05.710
the possibilities for
politics that will be

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.600
also part of our concern.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.400
And then I'm going to
talk about the, politics

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.913
of the economics.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.590
What I'm going to call the
rise of neoliberalism at home

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:23.560
and the Washington Consensus abroad

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.360
and this is put on this is basically

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:29.300
it comes to, exist because of

00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:35.130
the collapse of an
alternative to capitalism,

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:40.130
the disappearance of communism
as a viable, political system

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:44.440
as a viable economic system and so you

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.970
have this idea that's
often called neoliberalism

00:34:47.970 --> 00:34:50.340
that basically has three elements.

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.600
Its trade deregulation,
trade deals getting rid

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.290
of restraints on trade, getting
rid of internal regulation

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:01.700
within countries, and
massive privatization

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.750
of formerly state assets

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:06.950
that was called, the neoliberal approach

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:11.950
to political public political economy.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.290
And when it's translated into a set

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.480
of recommendations or requirements

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.490
for countries in the developing world,

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.950
it was called the Washington Consensus,

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:26.440
was essentially adopted by the World Bank

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:29.710
by the IMF as a condition for giving loans

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:33.310
to developing countries and it,

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:38.210
was essentially taking
neoliberalism global.

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:43.210
And so the, post communist era is marked

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:48.717
by, this massive confidence in, the

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:54.730
the capacity of unregulated

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.870
or mildly regulated
free-market capitalism,

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:03.870
to deliver the best results,
for every country in

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:07.560
the world then we're going to talk about

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:10.800
the new global order, that
is ushered in by this.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:15.120
We're going to look at
whether democracy really

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.070
was on the march the people thought

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:20.970
about a potential we had talked again

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.230
the conventional wisdom in
political science was that

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.740
the democratization had
preceded in three waves.

00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:32.278
The first wave being
the gradual expansion of

00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:34.579
the franchise in what we think of today as

00:36:34.579 --> 00:36:35.480
the older democracies,

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.870
the second wave being decolonization in

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:43.030
Africa and Asia and Latin
America after World War II.

00:36:43.030 --> 00:36:48.030
The third wave coming in 1989 to 1991

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:51.770
and people started to
wonder whether there's

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.530
a fourth wave now with
democratization of South Africa

00:36:55.530 --> 00:37:00.110
with settlements in places
like Northern Ireland,

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:04.140
initially with the Arab
Spring people wondered whether

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.830
we were going to start to
see more democracy as part of

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.543
this new global order.

00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:16.140
Then we're going to look at
the international institutions

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.370
that developed in this global order,

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.530
we'll talk about things like,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.470
the International Criminal Court

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:28.470
which for the first time would
hold dictators to account

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:33.060
for their activities of repression.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:36.980
There was the creation and of
something called a doctrine

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.610
at the United Nations called
the responsibility to protect.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.810
Responsibility to protect, says that this

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:48.810
was in the wake of, things
like the Rwanda genocide

00:37:52.489 --> 00:37:57.489
of 1994 and what happened in
Kosovo, in 1999 eventually

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.500
we got responsibility
to protect where the UN

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:03.240
was said all governments are going to

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.400
be held accountable for
severe human rights violations

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:13.470
within their own territories
and if they don't respect them,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.500
the UN is going to intervene,
militarily this is you know a

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.460
big change we're saying we're not going

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.540
to respect the sovereignty of Nations

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:31.540
so the new international
order seems to be,

00:38:32.604 --> 00:38:35.320
affecting not only
relations among countries

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:37.753
but relations within them.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.530
The third part of the course I'm calling

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.283
the end of the end of
history and this is really,

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.580
has its ultimate roots with 9/11

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:54.033
and the emergence of the
global war on terror.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:58.740
The invasion of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.440
and eventually the collapsing Syria

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.130
we're going to see that
the idea that history

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:11.090
was heading in some benign direction,

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:15.853
was getting harder and harder
for people to hold on to.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.440
we're going to look at the
resurgence of state capitalism.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.867
we're going to look at
what China was, has been

00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:30.910
and is doing in Africa.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.180
We are going to be looking
at Russia's resurgence

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.580
as a global power, they had
been back on their heels,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:42.910
for much of the 1990s and early 2000

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:47.350
but now they became actively
involved, in, the Middle East

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.350
and elsewhere, we're going to, look at,

00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.930
the new role of business in
many political conflicts around

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.180
the world sometimes with
benign purposes in mind,

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.380
but often not and so we're
going to start to see

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.450
a much messier politics.

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.680
The fourth part of the course, is about

00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.823
the new politics of insecurity.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.520
This is really ushered in not so much by

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.180
the financial crisis
itself, but by the way

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:25.240
in which governments responded
to the financial crisis

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.590
and this will be one of the areas

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.980
where we will be looking
at paths not taken but,

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.980
we will see that there
was, growing insecurity

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:41.210
in the workforces of many
of the advanced democracies

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:44.423
that had been building up for decades,

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.163
and the financial crisis,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.320
threw into sharp relief

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.130
the fact that most governments
were not doing much

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.647
about it if anything at all

00:40:59.647 --> 00:41:03.550
and in fact that they ended
up bailing out the elites,

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.600
while doing nothing much,

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.250
for the people who have been
most harmed in the crisis

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.910
and so we will look at the response to,

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.830
the financial crisis

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:20.830
in a number of countries
particularly in the US

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:26.690
and then we will all in the
last part of the course,

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.900
what is to be done that
great Leninists slogan,

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.680
we will be looking at, two things really.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:39.680
First how the, voter sentiment in

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.510
these countries was,
so poorly misdiagnosed

00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:47.250
by so many, political elites

00:41:47.250 --> 00:41:51.200
and people in control of
political parties, misdiagnosed

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.800
to the point where not only
did they fail to respond,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.410
to the growing economic insecurity,

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.410
that was experienced by many,
many millions of workers

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.170
within their own countries.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.820
They were actually
implementing political reforms

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.440
that were likely to make things worse.

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.100
And so the last part of the
course will be looking at

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.503
those two interacting issues.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:22.600
What sorts of economic
policies were pursued

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.823
or failed to be pursued.

00:42:25.875 --> 00:42:28.620
What kinds of policies
might have been pursued

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:32.773
and how did the reform
of political systems over

00:42:32.773 --> 00:42:36.540
the last 15 or 20 years,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.700
make the problem worse
and that will lead me,

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:43.730
to make some arguments, about
how we should, think about,

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:46.283
politics going forward.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.900
So, that is what we're going, to be doing.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.166
It's a big menu, we have, you know

00:42:54.166 --> 00:42:59.166
we have 26 now soon to be 25 lectures in

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.550
which to explore it.

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:06.340
I'm going to, before breaking today,

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:10.560
I'm going to talk about
a few logistical matters.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.920
One is that I have been
asked to announce but

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.853
you can see for yourself,

00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:18.220
that the Office of Public Affairs is,

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:22.390
taking pictures and
these lectures are going

00:43:23.278 --> 00:43:24.128
to be videotaped.

00:43:25.681 --> 00:43:29.300
And this will include, we
will have microphones so we

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:34.300
can have questions from
the floor and interaction

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.480
but you should know that,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.350
this is all being tape recorded and

00:43:40.458 --> 00:43:42.720
so anything you say can be taken down

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.433
and used in evidence against you.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.333
So, a couple of other logistical things.

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:54.160
One is I want to introduce
Christina Seyfreid.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.220
Christina, she's the head teaching fellow

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.540
for the course so for
she will be overseeing

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.450
the grading of students
who are taking the course,

00:44:05.450 --> 00:44:10.450
for, credit and she will
also be working with me,

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:16.040
in, running office hours for
people from the community,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.223
which we're both going to be doing.

00:44:19.366 --> 00:44:20.380
I'll say a little bit more about

00:44:21.765 --> 00:44:23.270
that in a minute but, you will see more

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:26.523
of Christina as we go along.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:31.290
Office hours I'm gonna be having

00:44:31.290 --> 00:44:34.203
office hours in Rosenkranz room 201

00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:38.840
from 10:00 to 12:00 on
Wednesdays and Fridays.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:40.590
The presumption there is that

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:45.280
from 10:00 to 12:00, Yale
students have priority.

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.990
These are walk-in office
hours not by appointment

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.480
and on 10:00 to 12:00
on Fridays, people from

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.720
the community have priority but who knows

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:58.150
if anyone will show up but
that's the way it'll work

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:02.910
201 Rosenkranz Hall
which is right opposite,

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.773
the new colleges up the street.

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.440
Christina is going to have office hours

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.610
for people from the
community on Thursdays,

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.840
from 5:00 to 7:00 at a place

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.273
yet to be announced and one
thing we're going to do,

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.150
the office hours are not just
going to vanish into the ether

00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:27.490
we're going to, Christina and I are going

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:32.040
to film five sessions over the course of

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:37.040
the semester, where she and
I will discuss what's come up

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.080
in the office hours and we will post that,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.520
on the course website.

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.770
I do this with my Coursera course

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:48.100
and it proves to be quite helpful.

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.890
So, we will get questions

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.190
that have come up in the office hours

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:55.010
both in our office hours
and in office hours,

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.433
between the students and
the Teaching Fellows,

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:02.560
that they will be participating
as well and we will publish

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.090
those videos of the office hours

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.843
on the course website.

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.613
Access to reading.

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.610
Anyone who has a Yale
ID can get almost all of

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.260
the readings on Canvas,

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.000
there's a few, I think three of

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.560
the book, we're using too much

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:29.880
for copyright reasons
to put them on Canvas

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:31.100
but they're all in the library

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.973
for anyone who doesn't want to buy any.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:40.010
The, people from the community
we have, made available

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.770
in the New Haven Public Library
if you don't have access

00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:47.770
to Canvas us a couple
of sets, of the books

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:50.510
that we're being using in the course

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.410
or you can get them that way.

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:57.500
Those who are taking, the
students who are taking the course

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:01.710
for credit the official exam is

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.043
the last afternoon of
the last day of exams,

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.010
which I'm sure some of you have
already bought plane tickets

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.223
that are, inconsistent with that.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:15.500
So actually we're going to
have to alternate exams.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.270
One on December 11th and this is primarily

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.080
to accommodate SOM students because,

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:27.810
of the timing of the SOM
elective, exam period

00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:30.700
and that exam will, if we can arrange it

00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:33.680
be held at SOM, and then there'll be,

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.893
but others can take it
then as well if they want.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.840
And then there'll be an another
alternate exam on Friday

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.930
the 13th so there'll be different times

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.333
at which people can take the exam.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:56.903
Policy here will be no laptops,
no screens, no iPhones.

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.680
I came to this policy
a couple of years ago.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.490
It definitely works better.

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:07.410
It's just too tempting to be
doing that Amazon shopping

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.650
for your grandmother's birthday present

00:48:10.650 --> 00:48:15.587
that you forgot about
and it's very distracting

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.250
not only for the people
around you but it's

00:48:20.250 --> 00:48:25.250
also distracting for me, to teach.

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:30.220
We will post the slides on Canvas and on

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:32.460
the course web page off the lectures

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:36.110
so people will have access, to the slides.

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:38.460
What you'll find is if
you go and you look at

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.453
the slides on Canvas,

00:48:42.778 --> 00:48:44.717
they'll look like they'd
been turned into a PDF

00:48:44.717 --> 00:48:47.190
and the video will not play.

00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:49.860
If you want to play the
video, you have to download

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.050
the slides and then it will
read, it will regurgitate

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.770
as playable videos,

00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:59.993
so it is possible to play the video,

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:06.540
yes so no laptops, no screens, no phones

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:13.340
and everything, everything I
put up here will be available

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.500
to you, so you don't have
to take copious notes

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.143
of what appears on slides.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.293
Comments, questions.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:34.600
Yes, sir, you're gonna have to yell.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.463
We will have microphones
here starting next time.

00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:42.236
(student speaking faintly)

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.340
You can't.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:49.410
So that's why we put a
set of the reasonings

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:52.150
in a New Haven library
and the reason for it,

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.513
it's not just Yale being mean.

00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:58.894
It turns out there're two
sets of copyright rules

00:49:58.894 --> 00:50:03.894
so if you are photocopying
chapters from a book,

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.253
you are allowed to take
up to 10% of the book,

00:50:10.337 --> 00:50:11.610
otherwise you have to buy the book

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:16.360
if you're using it but
universities, for their students,

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:18.540
have a more permissive rule.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.630
So we can take more than 10% from a book.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:23.230
I've forgotten what the exact number is

00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:24.880
but it's much more than 10%.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.780
We can take more than 10% from a book

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:31.840
and put it up on Canvas
if it's only available

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:35.870
to Yale students but if
we made them available

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.470
to the general public,

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.590
Yale would be violating copyright laws.

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:44.750
So that's why we have bought
two complete sets of the books

00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.500
and put them in a New
Haven Public Library,

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.810
from which we have been
xeroxing most of this stuff.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:54.456
So you should be able
to get the vast majority

00:50:54.456 --> 00:50:56.890
of the readings if you wanna go down there

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:57.723
and get them.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.010
Other questions, comments, observations?

00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.510
If there's a question in your mind,

00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:10.940
it's probably in the
mind of 30 other people

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:12.810
so they'll be grateful if you ask it.

00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:14.580
Yeah, you just have to yell.

00:51:15.698 --> 00:51:19.281
(student speaking faintly)

00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.614
Are we gonna look at the
European Union as well as what?

00:51:23.614 --> 00:51:27.197
(student speaking faintly)

00:51:31.630 --> 00:51:33.930
We're certainly gonna look at the growth

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:36.630
of the European Union and the expansion

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.480
of the European Union since, in fact,

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.703
we're gonna talk about it next class.

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.780
We're gonna look at the
expansion of the European Union

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.370
since the Cold War.

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.693
I'll talk very briefly about the early,

00:51:51.850 --> 00:51:54.983
this course is really post 1989.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.300
We've just hired David
Engerman and Arne Westad,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.480
who are both cold war historians

00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:05.720
who are gonna be teaching
courses on the Cold War.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.600
So if you really wanna deal
with the post-war Europe

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.600
from into war Europe II to
the end of the Cold War,

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:19.730
these are the guys who
are gonna be teaching

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:22.230
that stuff going forward in Yale College.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:25.623
So I'm very consciously not doing that.

00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:31.788
So I will talk about the way
in which the European Union

00:52:32.520 --> 00:52:35.420
was formed which has had a lot to do

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.550
with its current troubles but mostly,

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.690
I'm gonna focus on since 1989.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:43.563
Yeah, pardon?

00:52:44.675 --> 00:52:45.508
(student speaking faintly)

00:52:45.508 --> 00:52:47.500
There are no sections in this course.

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.910
This is why we have an
hour and a quarter lecture

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.370
rather than a 50-minute lecture.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:53.894
Yeah.

00:52:53.894 --> 00:52:56.980
(student speaking faintly)

00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.820
The topics for the papers
will be posted two weeks

00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:04.300
before the papers are
due and we will give,

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:07.440
I should say a couple
of things about that.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.760
This is not a research course

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.680
so you can write a first-rate
paper based on reading

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.560
the material on this syllabus.

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:19.793
You are not expected to
go beyond the syllabus.

00:53:21.523 --> 00:53:26.350
And we will post, two weeks
before the papers are due,

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:31.110
a list of topics of and it will be,

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:35.130
there will be very significant
amount of choice on it

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.330
so we'll probably give you
four or five possible topics

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:40.453
to write about.

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.263
Yes, sir.

00:53:44.099 --> 00:53:47.703
What is the expectation
for graduate students?

00:53:49.424 --> 00:53:54.424
The same course requirements,
two papers and a final exam.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.863
Yeah.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.013
Yes, sir.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:02.654
Pardon.

00:54:02.654 --> 00:54:04.532
- [Student] Is there a
limit for (mumbles) students

00:54:04.532 --> 00:54:05.365
to join the class?

00:54:05.365 --> 00:54:06.593
- No, there's no limit.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.370
This is an uncapped course.

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:14.460
I'm hoping we can stay in
this room, it looks like it.

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.770
Numbers tend to go down rather than up

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:18.253
during shopping period.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.863
It's not a capped course.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:25.113
Yeah.

00:54:26.164 --> 00:54:29.747
(student speaking faintly)

00:54:36.764 --> 00:54:38.650
People have taken courses
with me before know

00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.453
that I have a pretty
interactive lecturing style.

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.240
So yes, there will be microphones

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:45.733
and there will be questions.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.700
I'm not planning to talk
for an hour and a quarter

00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:51.533
every Tuesday and Thursday.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.960
So there will be significant
amount of interaction.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:00.236
Yes sir.

00:55:00.236 --> 00:55:03.390
(student speaking faintly)

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:07.530
Yeah, we currently, I believe, have six

00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.000
in addition to Christina's
Teaching Fellows,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.313
all of whom will be holding office hours.

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:17.440
They'll be available and
you will be able to go

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.430
and talk to them about
what's come up in the class,

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:23.840
about your papers and so on.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.040
And the conversations you have
with those teaching fellows,

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:31.730
we will also address then in
the videotaped office hours

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:32.713
that we post.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.323
Okay.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:46.150
So any other questions,
comments, reactions?

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.050
So on Tuesday, we're gonna talk about

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.820
the collapse of the Soviet
Union from Soviet Communism

00:55:58.820 --> 00:56:01.790
to Russian gangster capitalism.

00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:02.790
I will see you then.

00:56:04.356 --> 00:56:07.023
(music)

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.000
Let me begin the lecture with
the keywords for the lecture.&nbsp;

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.967
Just a couple of words
that will help you

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.600
understand important themes
for this lecture and for

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.100
Wednesday, for the
entire week, really.&nbsp;

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100
And those phrases are,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.000
the keywords are
the Talented Tenth,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Talented Tenth,
uplift and respectability,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.400
putting them together,
uplift and respectability,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.567
and race management.&nbsp;

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:35.300
Talented Tenth, uplift
and respectability,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.900
and race management.&nbsp; Let
me start with a quote.&nbsp;

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.000
"It seems manifest
to me that as

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.367
a race in this land,
we have no art;

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.667
we have no science;
we have no philosophy;

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.667
we have no scholarship.&nbsp;
Individuals we have in each

00:00:56.667 --> 00:01:00.600
of these lines, but mere
individuality cannot be

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.867
recognized as the
aggregation of a family,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:08.000
a nation, or a race, or as
the interpretation of any of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.900
them.&nbsp; And until we attain
the role of civilization,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.167
we cannot stand up and hold
our place in the world of

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:19.400
culture and enlightenment.&nbsp;
And the forfeiture of

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.267
such a place means
inferiority, repulsion,

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:28.467
drudgery, poverty,
and ultimate death."

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:33.700
The quote is from a man
named Alexander Crummell,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.100
from one of his final
publications--essays--called

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.300
"Civilization: The
Primal Need of a Race,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.100
 excuse me, "Civilization:
The Primal Need of the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.100
Race."&nbsp; You'll see
in this lecture,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.400
and perhaps even identified
a tiny bit in this quote,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.267
some linkages to
the last lecture,

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:00.967
thinking about manliness and
civilization, and Ida B.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:03.600
Wells Barnett, and the kinds
of claims she was making

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.900
about the white South, that
they were lacking in both.&nbsp;

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.100
Today we're talking--the
reason there's a linkage

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.600
there, we're talking about the
same era, generally speaking.&nbsp;

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.367
This week, we're going to move
from essentially the 1880s into

00:02:20.367 --> 00:02:22.200
the first decade of the
1900s, just to give

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900
you a chronological bearing.&nbsp;

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.300
And that overlaps a lot
with the lecture I was,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.400
I had on Wednesday,
dealing with Ida B.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.600
Wells' anti-lynching
crusades as well.&nbsp; Now I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.467
started the lecture
with Alexander Crummell,

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:44.367
and let me explain why.&nbsp;
I think he's a nice

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:47.967
vehicle through which we can
understand a lot of the

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:53.500
themes of this week's
lectures.&nbsp; Crummell was a

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.067
black man, born into a free
family in 1819.&nbsp; His family

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:03.067
was essentially a minority
within a minority.&nbsp; Both

00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:07.167
parents were literate, they
were active abolitionists,

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:10.700
and they enjoyed a
materially comfortable life

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.867
in that particular context.&nbsp;
Crummell is born free to

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:17.700
literate parents and active
abolitionists.&nbsp; He's not the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.767
typical--this is not the
typical African American

00:03:20.767 --> 00:03:24.600
experience prior to
emancipation.&nbsp; He's educated

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.800
by his father and at private
schools throughout the

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.700
Northeast, although not
without controversy.&nbsp; In one

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.700
of the schools he
came to in New York,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.167
when the townspeople learned
that they were going to

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.800
educate free
blacks at that school,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.300
really just a
one room house,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.600
they hitched oxen to the
house and pulled it in to a

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.000
swamp.&nbsp; Anyway, Crummell
does get an education,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.800
becomes a minister, and
then heads off to Cambridge

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.067
University in
1848, excuse me,

00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:59.767
1845.&nbsp; Crummell's departure
for England and his

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:03.000
subsequent classical
training marked a watershed

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.500
moment in his personal
intellectual development.&nbsp;

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.600
He originally left the US
only to obtain a degree from

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
Cambridge and raise money to
build a new church back in

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.267
the United States.&nbsp; Now he
leaves in 1845.&nbsp; He does not

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:21.000
come back to the US, except
for two very brief visits,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.900
he does not come back to
the US until 1872.&nbsp; So he is

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.900
gone from the country during
the great sectional crisis.&nbsp;

00:04:33.367 --> 00:04:37.067
Goes to England in 1845, he
doesn't stay in England the

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:43.100
whole time.&nbsp; He starts
getting sick in England,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.167
and then he decides to move
to a warmer climate for his

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:48.100
health.&nbsp; This is the
thinking of the time.&nbsp; He

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.800
departs for Liberia,
the West Coast of Africa,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.800
in 1853, and he would
remain there for almost two

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.967
decades.&nbsp; By this action, it
appears as if Crummell was

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.167
doing exactly that which he
fought so strongly against

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:08.200
in his public orations prior
to this moment.&nbsp; He was

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.267
immigrating to Africa, just
as the African Colonization

00:05:12.267 --> 00:05:14.700
Society recommended African
Americans do.&nbsp; This is a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.200
group I mentioned in passing
a week and a half ago,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.967
it's a, you know, a group
advocating blacks get out of

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:24.400
the United States, and
advocating colonization,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.600
go back to where they
belong is the thinking,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.400
in shorthand.&nbsp; Well, when
Crummell goes to England,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.367
he goes there somewhat
against the activity of the

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.567
African Colonization
Society.&nbsp; He's campaigning

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:39.500
actively against that idea.&nbsp;
We should not send blacks,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.200
you know, quote,
"back to Africa,

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.100
 black Americans, that is.&nbsp;
Their homeland is the United

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.300
States.&nbsp; But by the time
Crummell leaves for Liberia,

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.900
he actually is advocating
colonization.&nbsp; So Crummell

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.800
goes through this
interesting shift,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.367
it seems.&nbsp; He leaves
for England for a,

00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:02.967
an advanced degree, and to
get the education and raise

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:06.200
funds to build a church back
in the United States.&nbsp; He

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.800
stays in England,
then leaves for Africa,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.200
advocating colonization, the
very thing that he had been

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.100
fighting against for
his adult life up to that

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.500
point.&nbsp; Now Crummell's
advocacy for colonization is

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.967
different from that of
people like in the African

00:06:22.967 --> 00:06:24.400
Colonization
Society who are saying,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.600
"Let's just get this problem
out of our hair."&nbsp; Crummell

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.500
believed in the hierarchy
of civilization.&nbsp; That's an

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500
important phrase, the
hierarchy of civilization.&nbsp;

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.700
And he believed
that African natives,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.800
who in Crummell's
mind were pagan,

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.067
that African natives
were at the bottom of this

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:50.600
hierarchy.&nbsp; So instead of
advocating for blacks to

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.000
move to--black Americans to
move to Africa to solve an

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.400
American problem, he's
calling for black Americans

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.300
to move to Africa to solve
an African problem and a

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.100
Christian problem.&nbsp; Crummell
believed that at one time,

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.967
black Africans were at the
top of the civilizational

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:14.367
ladder, top of the
hierarchy.&nbsp; But over time,

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:16.800
with technical innovation
and divine providence,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.967
very important, he
believed that Europeans,

00:07:19.967 --> 00:07:22.467
especially the English,
were now at the top of the

00:07:22.467 --> 00:07:27.100
hierarchy, top of this
ladder.&nbsp; So Crummell's

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.867
advocating blacks
come--black Americans come

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.100
to Africa to
save the Africans,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.867
to Christianize
them, to rise them up,

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:40.700
to lift them up beyond their
pagan roots.&nbsp; Eventually,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.700
Crummell becomes frustrated
in Liberia with his attempts

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:47.700
to civilize the
natives through letters in

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.300
educational salvation.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.000
Returns to the United States
to head up one of the most

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.400
prominent
churches in Washington,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.200
D.C., St. Luke's Episcopal,
serving a predominantly

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.300
black and almost exclusively
wealthy black community.&nbsp;

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.200
Comes back in 1872, starts
up this--heads up this

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.300
church and really helps
expand it and grow it,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.367
and he dies in 1898.&nbsp; Now
what does all this have to

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:21.900
do with today's lecture?&nbsp;
Crummell embodies many of

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.267
the important elements that
define black leadership and

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:28.167
elite life in the second
half of the nineteenth

00:08:28.167 --> 00:08:32.400
century.&nbsp; Although he
did not coin the phrase,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.900
Crummell lived the ideology
that suggested the Talented

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.100
Tenth.&nbsp; The Talented Tenth
would be the ones to save

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.000
the race.&nbsp; Although he did
not live long enough to see

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.200
it mature, Crummell founded
the American Negro Academy.&nbsp;

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.867
More about that in a few
minutes.&nbsp; Crummell founded

00:08:50.867 --> 00:08:55.767
the American Negro Academy
which took as its--as its

00:08:55.767 --> 00:09:00.567
explicit mission to save the
race via the profound ideas

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:05.200
of the Talented Tenth.&nbsp;
And although Crummell sees

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.067
himself certainly as
at least a political

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:12.467
progressive, if
not a radical,

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:13.900
one can see in
this quick glimpse,

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:19.867
this tour of his biography,
a notion that blacks had not

00:09:19.867 --> 00:09:22.100
attained sufficient
greatness to be considered

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:27.000
contributors to the
civilized world.&nbsp; You can

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.600
see in this kind of
ideology--this kind of

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.800
sentiment an inherent
conservatism.&nbsp; And in this

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.200
way, Crummell's a race
manager.&nbsp; So much of his

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.800
project is about trying to
find a way to save the race,

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.367
to manage its problems
and its solutions.&nbsp; Again,

00:09:45.367 --> 00:09:48.900
the keywords for
today are Talented Tenth,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.800
uplift and
respectability, and,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.700
implicit in both, race
management.&nbsp; As I stated a

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.100
few minutes ago, this
lecture--this week's worth

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:05.100
of lectures lingers between
around 1890 and 1910,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.400
an era famously referred
to, at least famously in the

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.267
black
community, as the nadir,

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:12.000
the worst part,
the N-A-D-I-R,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.667
the nadir, the worst part of
the free black experience.&nbsp;

00:10:16.667 --> 00:10:19.000
Saw last week frightful
representations of white

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
control via lynching, and I
talked about other methods

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.700
of social and political
control used by whites to

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:29.900
eliminate black economic
opportunity and the black

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.600
male voting presence.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.267
&nbsp;Now as bad as
these things were,

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:38.100
there's no doubt
it was horrific,

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:41.000
it would be a mistake to
say that blacks were without

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.267
hope, that they were an
utterly downtrodden people,

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:50.000
doomed to their degraded
position.&nbsp; There were in

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.200
fact glimmers of
hope and activism,

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.867
even though it grew out
of a reality of despair.

00:10:56.867 --> 00:11:01.267
So a profoundly
difficult time for the

00:11:01.267 --> 00:11:03.467
post-emancipation
African American experience,

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:11.367
but don't bottle it up and
say it's all despair and all

00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:16.800
misery.&nbsp; See, glimmers of
hope can be identified in,

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:22.567
sort of in essentially two
ways: on the ground in daily

00:11:22.567 --> 00:11:25.967
acts of resistance, like the
kinds you had read about in

00:11:25.967 --> 00:11:30.800
Tera Hunter's wonderful book
To 'Joy My Freedom.&nbsp; And you

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.200
see glimmers of hope
perhaps in polite society,

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.367
via the work of
reformers, churches,

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:41.600
societies, and
associations.&nbsp; A few quick

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.000
words about on the ground
resistance.&nbsp; We know from

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.600
Tera Hunter that thinking
about struggle--her book,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.900
her argument, is about
struggle on the ground,

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.267
and the ways in which
the black community was

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:05.600
negotiating class politics
during this era--on the

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.700
ground struggles of daily
resistance means small acts

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.200
of resistance, until people
like Tera Hunter came along,

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.867
lost to history, one would
think.&nbsp; It's about doing

00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:22.167
work more slowly than you
possibly can.&nbsp; It means

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:28.100
stealing scraps when you
know you shouldn't be,

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:33.900
stealing labor in a sense in
the houses where you work or

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.267
in the factories where you
worked.&nbsp; Quietly finding

00:12:39.267 --> 00:12:43.000
ways to say no to the orders
that you've been given,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.100
to the life you've
been forced to lead,

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:52.500
although outwardly you're
saying yes.&nbsp; You can't

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.767
discount these small acts of
daily resistance.&nbsp; They are

00:12:56.767 --> 00:13:00.667
important.&nbsp; Think of Tera
Hunter's laundry workers who

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.300
would claim control of their
bodies in the evening when

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.600
they went out dancing.&nbsp;
They had some sort of real

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:12.567
psychological
relief, physical relief,

00:13:12.567 --> 00:13:15.000
in exerting control over
their own bodies and being

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.400
out in a certain space,
even though their own--their

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.500
bosses wouldn't
have appreciated it,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:22.000
and certainly the black
elite looked down their

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.167
noses at their
actions.&nbsp; This is important,

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.367
but it's also important to
realize the psychological

00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:32.400
benefits could be fleeting,
in the acts of daily

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:34.700
resistance, because the
fact of the matter is,

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.867
when those workers woke up
the next morning after a

00:13:37.867 --> 00:13:42.467
great night out, they
had to go back to work.

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:47.000
&nbsp;They had to find a way to
put food on the table.&nbsp; And

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.500
so although we cannot
discount the benefits of

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500
psychological relief, we
need to understand them as

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.367
well for the real
limits that they had.&nbsp; Life

00:13:58.367 --> 00:14:04.967
remained
difficult.&nbsp; Now you have,

00:14:04.967 --> 00:14:09.500
at the same time as
Tera Hunter's washerwomen,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.700
black activists who were
thinking of long-term gains

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.500
for the black community
that extended beyond the

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.667
boundaries of their own
body.&nbsp; These were the

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:21.900
people, it's
important to realize,

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:25.067
who had the freedom and
security to think beyond the

00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:27.467
daily existence.&nbsp; They had
some means.&nbsp; Now we're not

00:14:27.467 --> 00:14:31.600
talking wealthy
people, rich people,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:34.867
but they had some sort of
security.&nbsp; They knew there

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.000
were meals
coming all week long.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.900
Their--their house,
they owned their house,

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:44.900
they had shelter.&nbsp; They had
some measure of education.&nbsp;

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.000
So they had the leisure time
to think about long-term

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
solutions.&nbsp; These were
the people who considered

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
themselves the Talented
Tenth.&nbsp; These were the

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
people who thrived in polite
society and who saw it as

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
their duty to uplift
the race.&nbsp; Bless you.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This last phrase, I want you
to think about and what's

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
important for this lecture.&nbsp;
They saw it as their duty to

00:15:06.567 --> 00:15:12.567
uplift the race.&nbsp; Now for
the rest of the lecture I'm

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.667
going to, in a sense,
explore that phrase,

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:30.100
and extrapolate meaning from
it.&nbsp; For the rest of the

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.767
lecture, I want to explore
uplift's roots in the

00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:34.400
Northern church.&nbsp; I'll
explore the linkage between

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.700
uplift and the new growth
of associations in American

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.700
culture.&nbsp; But
most importantly,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.800
I want to explore uplift's
investment in gender

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:54.900
dynamics and uplift's
equally subversive and

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.800
conservative nature.&nbsp; It's
really critical that you

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.467
understand uplift
was, at its core,

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:05.167
a dynamic ideology that
was imbued with that era's

00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:08.100
restrictive gender and class
conventions.&nbsp; There's a

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.800
gendered element to uplift,
there's a class element to

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:16.700
uplift, that make uplift
both subversive--subversive

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.700
and conservative.&nbsp;
Think back to my framing of

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:25.567
Alexander Crummell's life.&nbsp;
He considered himself a

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:29.100
political progressive
and yet his ideology was

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.900
fundamentally conservative.&nbsp;
Let's look at uplift's

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:38.300
roots.&nbsp; We can trace uplift
back as an identifiable

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.567
ideology to a group called
the American Baptist Home

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:45.400
Mission Society, the
American Baptist Home

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.300
Mission Society.&nbsp; It's a
Northern and white-run

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:55.900
effort to educate and
civilize Southern blacks.&nbsp;

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:59.467
It's the post-Emancipation
and Reconstruction era we're

00:16:59.467 --> 00:17:01.100
talking about here.&nbsp;
The American Baptist Home

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.367
Mission Society
is a Northern,

00:17:03.367 --> 00:17:06.100
white-run effort to educate
and civilize Southern

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:10.567
blacks.&nbsp; One of the leaders
of the Home Mission Society

00:17:10.567 --> 00:17:13.200
is a man named
Henry Morehouse.

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.000
He's the man, white man, who
coined the phrase Talented

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.200
Tenth, that that ten
percent of black America,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.567
really much more like a
tenth of one percent,

00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:25.200
would be that group
to uplift the race,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200
to lift it up.&nbsp; In
fact, Henry Morehouse,

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.900
for those who know
your historically black

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.700
colleges--colleges
and universities,

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:38.300
Morehouse College, the most
important black college for

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.667
educating black men
in history--still is,

00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:44.767
still is there today, still
doing amazing work--is named

00:17:44.767 --> 00:17:46.600
for Henry
Morehouse.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.800
this is an era when church
membership--so why the

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.800
American Baptist Home
Mission Society?&nbsp; This is an

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:58.567
era when church membership
is increasing rapidly,

00:17:58.567 --> 00:18:03.500
but organized religious
bodies start to clash with

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:07.367
what can best be called
grassroots black worship

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:12.400
styles from religious
organizations.&nbsp; One of the

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.200
things that's important to
recognize is that much as

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.000
prior to emancipation,
blacks couldn't marry,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
they couldn't
get an education,

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.400
very often they couldn't
practice their own religious

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:35.167
faiths, certainly not openly
and publicly.&nbsp; So you see a

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:37.900
sort of boom
within black America,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.100
a public exhortation,
or demonstration,

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:51.667
of the desire to practice
faith.&nbsp; But they wanted to

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:55.300
do it in their own ways
and form their own religious

00:18:55.300 --> 00:19:01.100
organizations.&nbsp; This is
a complicating factor,

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.000
to put it mildly, when it
came to the American Baptist

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.767
Home Mission Society.&nbsp; The
Home Mission Society was

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:13.100
coming down from the North,
setting up schools and

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.800
churches, setting up schools
in sort of the same spirit

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.267
as the Freedmen's
Bureau, setting up churches,

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:26.167
Baptist churches, setting
up an order of prayer,

00:19:26.167 --> 00:19:30.500
systems of
practice, to educate and

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.700
civilize--civilize
through faith,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:38.000
adherence to the Bible and
Christian ethics--so to save

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
the, save the race.&nbsp; Well,
blacks begin to bristle at

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.567
the fact that they are
not allowed by the American

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:51.067
Baptist Home Mission
Society structure,

00:19:51.067 --> 00:19:52.800
that they aren't allowed
to contribute to the Sunday

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.500
school teaching literature.&nbsp;
Whatever they had to teach

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.967
on a Sunday was, quote,
"given to them" by this

00:19:58.967 --> 00:20:04.900
Northern church.&nbsp; The
American Baptist Publication

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.200
Society refused their
contributions.&nbsp; It's a

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.300
tension here about religion
and religious teaching,

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.300
practices certainly, but
it's also about control over

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.900
their secular activities.&nbsp;
The American Baptist Home

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:26.400
Mission Society wanted
blacks to function in

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.200
accordance with their
guidelines and their

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.500
principles.&nbsp;
And, increasingly,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.900
blacks were
saying, "I'm, you know,

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:38.400
I'm getting frustrated by
this."&nbsp; You have a breaking

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:43.700
point in 1895, the year, as
you'll see over this lecture

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:48.300
and next lecture, very
important year.&nbsp; Serious

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:51.800
breach appears in 1895
when a number of blacks come

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.367
together, Southern blacks,
too frustrated any longer to

00:20:56.367 --> 00:20:57.700
abide by the American
Baptist Home Mission

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.067
Society's edicts, and
forms its own society,

00:21:01.067 --> 00:21:06.800
the National Baptist
Convention.&nbsp; The National

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.200
Baptist Convention is
created by and about

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.200
blacks.&nbsp; It's organized to
establish black control over

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.600
the church, their churches,
their religious practices

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.800
and secular activities.&nbsp;
It even goes as far as to

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:24.700
establish its own publishing
company so it could produce,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.067
among other things, Sunday
school literature written by

00:21:27.067 --> 00:21:31.100
blacks.&nbsp; So you have
the American Baptist Home

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.600
Mission Society coming
down from the North with a

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:39.500
frankly patronizing attitude
about saving the race.&nbsp;

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.900
After some time,
the race says,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.467
"We'll form our own
organization if you won't

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:45.500
let us have some control in
our own churches."&nbsp; Thus the

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:50.267
National Baptist Convention
is formed.&nbsp; Now before going

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.267
any further,
going any further,

00:21:51.267 --> 00:21:53.500
it's important to think
about what a church actually

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.900
was.&nbsp; These were
places to worship,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.300
of course, but it's also
important to realize that

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:07.967
churches play many
different roles in the black

00:22:07.967 --> 00:22:10.000
community, and the
white community as well,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.300
but we're talking about the
African American experience

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.567
right here.&nbsp; These churches
were places where they

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:18.500
taught literacy.&nbsp; Certainly
that's what Sunday school

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.267
classes are
partly about as well,

00:22:22.267 --> 00:22:27.000
but we're talking sort of
daily education.&nbsp; They were

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
also places to find food.&nbsp;
If you're running short on

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
food, you go to the
church to be fed or get some

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.600
supplies--provide
basic healthcare,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.600
employment information,
clothes.&nbsp; So the church was

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.600
not just a place
functioning in the black

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:57.400
community--community as a
site on Sundays to be in

00:22:59.467 --> 00:23:03.900
deep reflection and other
days to seek solace.&nbsp; It was

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.600
doing that
certainly, but also feeding,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.800
educating, clothing
the black community,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:13.167
and providing basic
healthcare as well.&nbsp; So the

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:17.267
church needs to be
understood as what one

00:23:17.267 --> 00:23:21.500
scholar calls "a discursive
space in the black public

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.867
sphere whose very conscious
role was to uplift the

00:23:25.867 --> 00:23:30.967
race."&nbsp; "A discursive space
in the black public sphere

00:23:30.967 --> 00:23:33.200
whose very conscious role
was to uplift the race."&nbsp;

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:36.000
Saving the race
through God, through food,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.500
through education,
through clothing,

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:44.300
through healthcare, across
the board.&nbsp; So churches were

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:49.700
religious and secular
spaces.&nbsp; Now in addition to

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.867
the growing secular activity
of the black church,

00:23:53.867 --> 00:23:56.567
there's a rapid
expansion of intellectual,

00:23:56.567 --> 00:24:00.567
social, and literary
societies in black America.&nbsp;

00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:03.867
Now this is a
phenomenon across the races,

00:24:03.867 --> 00:24:06.267
the United States
during this time,

00:24:06.267 --> 00:24:09.267
the late nineteenth
century.&nbsp; It's important to

00:24:09.267 --> 00:24:12.400
realize the significant
organizations in black

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.100
America weren't--black
America weren't just the

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.100
churches.&nbsp; There's cultural
and intellectual societies

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.367
as well.

00:24:22.367 --> 00:24:24.600
&nbsp;As far as black
America was concerned,

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.100
these societies,
these associations,

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.567
were all a part of
the struggle to become

00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:32.867
self-sufficient.&nbsp; It's
important to protect its own

00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:36.667
flanks and to provide
for those who are less

00:24:36.667 --> 00:24:40.767
fortunate.&nbsp; So you have
fraternal orders and benefit

00:24:40.767 --> 00:24:44.600
societies, like the
Masons, the Odd Fellows,

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.800
the Knights of Tabor,
all of which were for men.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.300
Or the Order of
the Eastern Star,

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.800
the Sisters of the Calanth
for women.&nbsp; You have secret

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.767
societies offering
insurance--insurance against

00:24:57.767 --> 00:25:02.700
sickness and death, and aid
to widows and orphans.&nbsp; And

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.667
then eventually, you
have insurance societies,

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:09.000
companies, most famously the
North Carolina Mutual Life

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.200
Insurance Company.&nbsp; This is
the largest black business

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.400
in the United States for
quite some time.&nbsp; The rise

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.600
of black banks and so
on.&nbsp; So you see a range of

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.800
really, for lack
of a better phrase,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:25.100
community service
associations developing.&nbsp;

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.400
Places for fellowship, sort
of a secular fellowship,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.700
certainly, but also a
place to gather to sort out

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:32.900
information about somebody
who might be in trouble that

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.000
we can help out, to sort
of raise funds to improve

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.900
schools by hiring a
new teacher perhaps;

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:43.400
to provide resources
when somebody dies,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.967
a mutual aid
benefit society;

00:25:45.967 --> 00:25:48.700
give resources
to the children,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:56.700
widows; to literally put
your money someplace.&nbsp; These

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.400
were all rather dramatic
changes.&nbsp; They may not--may

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.700
not seem like
much, but again,

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.200
when you're
starting from zero,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.600
anything is something.&nbsp; So
in addition to these service

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:13.067
societies, you have
intellectual societies,

00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:15.700
like the
American Negro Academy,

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:20.700
founded in 1897.&nbsp; The ANA,
the American Negro Academy,

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.267
was not the
first of its sort,

00:26:23.267 --> 00:26:25.467
but it was the first
to talk about uplift in

00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:30.267
systematically intellectual
ways.&nbsp; So it's not about job

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:31.300
training.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.500
It's not about
finding clothes or food for

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.567
somebody.&nbsp; It's about saving
the race through the power

00:26:39.567 --> 00:26:43.467
of the intellect and through
training.&nbsp; The ANA was

00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:46.100
limited to twenty or so
leading men of the race,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.100
this would be the phrase of
the time.&nbsp; Women were not

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.100
allowed.&nbsp; And the
goal of the ANA,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.500
those twenty leading men,
would be to develop the next

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.800
generation of leaders to
solve America's racial

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.100
ills.&nbsp; It's a
rather ambitious goal,

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.800
but that was it,
quite literally.&nbsp; W.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
E.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:08.800
B.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.867
Du Bois, someone who--a
lot of you may see "Du-bwah"

00:27:10.867 --> 00:27:13.200
when you see the
name, it's "Du-boys,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.267
 that's the way his
family pronounced it--W.

00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:15.267
E.

00:27:15.267 --> 00:27:16.267
B.

00:27:16.267 --> 00:27:17.267
Du Bois, who we'll
hear more about tomorrow,

00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:18.267
and we'll hear about
intermittently throughout

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:20.500
the course, a man of
incredible importance in the

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.500
twentieth century African
American experience--Du Bois

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.267
had just received his Ph.

00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:27.267
D.

00:27:27.267 --> 00:27:29.400
from Harvard, and is the
first vice president of the

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.400
organization.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.300
He's Alexander Crummell's
protégé.&nbsp; As I said before,

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:41.200
the ANA was exclusive to
men.&nbsp; It's an organization

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.167
that really lasts about
twenty-five years before it

00:27:45.167 --> 00:27:49.200
falls apart.&nbsp; I can't say
that it changes much of

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.200
anything.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.700
It establishes a
journal, it publishes ideas,

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.867
it has lectures.&nbsp; Early
on, it allowed one woman to

00:27:55.867 --> 00:28:01.267
lecture before its august
body.&nbsp; But that was sort of,

00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:04.167
I mean I'm simplifying it,
but the ANA did not offer

00:28:04.167 --> 00:28:08.500
much in transactional
change for black America,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.600
but it's articulating a
vision that the way to save

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.900
the race was through
developing the intellect,

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:23.900
civilizing the race with its
most educated men.&nbsp; Right at

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.800
the same time the American
Negro Academy is formed,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.500
in fact a year earlier,
another association is

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:32.800
formed, certainly more
important and effective,

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.267
called the National
Association of Colored

00:28:35.267 --> 00:28:39.000
Women.&nbsp; The National
Association of Colored

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.900
Women, NACW.&nbsp; Tellingly,
the motto of the NACW is

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:49.500
"Lifting while we climb."&nbsp;
"Lifting while we climb."

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:57.500
Now what did it do?&nbsp; It was
sort of an amalgamation of

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.800
the American
Negro Academy ethos,

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.567
and the American Baptist
Home Mission Society,

00:29:05.567 --> 00:29:11.200
and National Baptist
Convention.&nbsp; It's an

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.800
organization of
middle and upper classes,

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.300
as far as status--social
status--middle and upper

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:24.300
class black women, the "best
sort" as it were.&nbsp; That they

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.000
would gather together
on a, I don't know,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.200
twice a month,
monthly basis,

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.700
network socially certainly.&nbsp;
But they would also organize

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.800
political protests,
something really quite

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.767
astonishing.&nbsp; This is
not the kind of person,

00:29:38.767 --> 00:29:43.000
not the kind of woman, not
the kind of class figure who

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.200
would publicly protest.&nbsp; But
I didn't think to bring the

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.100
image with me, but in
the very first lecture,

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:52.000
I showed a slide of members
of the NACW picketing the

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.467
White House for an
anti-lynching law in the

00:29:56.467 --> 00:30:01.500
1930s.&nbsp; Here's a woman who'd
walk the picket line to

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:09.000
press a political point.&nbsp;
And they also conducted

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
basic agitation for child
welfare reform.&nbsp; So they're

00:30:17.167 --> 00:30:20.267
trying to network
amongst themselves,

00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:24.000
raise the political stakes,
and also agitate for child

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.600
welfare reform.&nbsp;
They're like the ANA,

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.800
because they're a
certain type of person,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.000
of class.&nbsp; They're like the
Baptist Home Mission Society

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.267
in the sense that they were
trying to uplift the race,

00:30:40.267 --> 00:30:43.800
save the children.&nbsp; And in
a sense like the National

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.000
Baptist Convention, by
acting in explicitly

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.667
political ways.&nbsp; And
the National Baptist

00:30:48.667 --> 00:30:51.100
Convention's own creation
was an explicitly political

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:58.300
act.&nbsp; Thinking from
the NACW's perspective,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.700
uplift can be seen as
both subversive and

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.600
conservative.&nbsp; It
was subversive,

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.600
since it was helping educate
and clean up poor and

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.967
unclean people.&nbsp;
Sad, sad to say,

00:31:09.967 --> 00:31:11.500
but this was a
subversive act,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.600
trying to clean people
up, trying to improve their

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.067
health.&nbsp; And this is really
something you need to be

00:31:19.067 --> 00:31:24.467
aware of.&nbsp; This was an
era of an epidemiologist's

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:29.867
nightmare.&nbsp; Cities are
really forming rapidly.&nbsp;

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:33.100
People are coming
to urban centers,

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:35.000
but hygiene isn't coming
as fast as the people are

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.267
coming.&nbsp; Cities and streets
literally built on top of

00:31:38.267 --> 00:31:44.267
filth, of refuse,
excrement.&nbsp; Disease is in

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.900
the air.&nbsp; Tera Hunter
lays this out in her book,

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:56.467
all these campaigns to teach
proper hygiene habits.&nbsp; It

00:31:56.467 --> 00:32:00.200
wasn't just about nice
manners--nice manners and a

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:03.700
white dress.&nbsp; These were
life and death kind of

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.367
skills they were trying
to teach the poor and the

00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:11.200
unclean.&nbsp; Trying to wage
anti-tuberculosis campaigns,

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:15.400
for instance.&nbsp; So the NACW
is trying to do something

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.200
radical by trying to help
educate and clean up people

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.700
who were ignored by
society.&nbsp; But it was

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:28.300
also--excuse me, and it was
also subversive for the way

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.767
it engaged in explicit acts
of political resistance like

00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:33.100
picketing,
advocating anti-lynching,

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:37.800
the passing of
anti-lynching law,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:42.500
lobbying people.&nbsp; But uplift
from NACW's perspective,

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:44.400
or its--the way it
interpreted uplift,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:49.300
was also quite conservative,
because NACW membership

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.000
recognized in itself the
express need for them to

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.800
clean up the race; that
the duty--I used the phrase,

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.100
the word earlier in the
lecture--it was the "duty"

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.667
of the black
middle and upper class,

00:33:03.667 --> 00:33:08.400
especially the
women, to save the race,

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:15.800
to clean it up and to get
the poor and dirty blacks,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.800
Southern blacks, to learn
how to behave respectably.&nbsp;

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.600
Think back to
the last lecture,

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.700
the manliness
and civilization,

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:31.200
respectability floating
through all of that.&nbsp; To the

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.300
women of the NACW, they
had a lot of work to do.

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.000
Most blacks were
unclean, and poorly behaved,

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.300
and uneducated.&nbsp; So uplift
taken all together then,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.400
radical and conservative,
but essentially a

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:52.400
manifestation of white
middle class propriety that

00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.067
these black
Victorians grew up in,

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:02.667
took it as their own, and
tried to perfect it for the

00:34:02.667 --> 00:34:09.700
next generation.&nbsp; Black
women felt a sense of duty,

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.367
these black middle class
women and upper class women

00:34:11.367 --> 00:34:15.400
felt a sense of duty, and
they had a special ability

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.400
from their self-conception.&nbsp;
They had a special ability

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:22.567
to save the race.&nbsp;
Anna Julia Cooper,

00:34:22.567 --> 00:34:26.200
the leading black feminist
theorist of her day,

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:32.067
who was also a leading
educator having taught at

00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:33.167
Dunbar High
School--actually,

00:34:33.167 --> 00:34:37.767
I want to talk about Dunbar
for just a few seconds,

00:34:37.767 --> 00:34:40.300
because it's actually a
remarkable institution.&nbsp;

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.500
I'll probably mention it
in a few weeks.&nbsp; Anna Julia

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.867
Cooper taught mathematics
at--It was actually the M

00:34:47.867 --> 00:34:51.400
Street High School at
the time in Washington,

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.800
D.C.&nbsp; Its name is changed
eventually to Dunbar.&nbsp;

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.200
Dunbar becomes the
breeding ground,

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.600
over the first five decades
of the twentieth century,

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.700
of the black leadership
elite for the D.C.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.967
area and, actually, for much
of the nation.&nbsp; If you look

00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:09.000
at a lot of black
political leaders,

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.300
you will often see Dunbar
High School on the résumé.&nbsp;

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.567
So, you know, talking
about a leading intellectual

00:35:13.567 --> 00:35:16.600
teaching at a high
school, and that,

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.700
and that, how can that be
important?&nbsp; Dunbar was not

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.667
your typical high school.&nbsp;
It was by far the best black

00:35:23.667 --> 00:35:29.000
high school in the country.&nbsp;
It was the best public high

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.467
school in the District,
black or white.&nbsp; If you look

00:35:31.467 --> 00:35:34.700
at the kind of training that
the teachers had and the

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.700
eventual career
path of its graduates,

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:40.800
it's an astonishing
institution.&nbsp; Anyway Anna

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.300
Julia Cooper, leading
theorist of her day,

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.667
teaches at Dunbar High
School.&nbsp; Later on in her

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:52.100
career, she leaves Dunbar.&nbsp;
I think she's sixty-three

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:53.100
when she gets her Ph.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.100
D.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.567
from the Sorbonne.&nbsp; She
comes back to Washington,

00:35:57.567 --> 00:36:01.600
D.C., and
establishes a university,

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.800
Frelinghuysen University--I
probably butchered it,

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:08.900
I don't know German.&nbsp;
Essentially an evening

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:11.267
university, "university"
in sort of quotes,

00:36:11.267 --> 00:36:14.900
an institution where black
workers who want to make

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:18.267
that next step in
advancement will come and

00:36:18.267 --> 00:36:21.400
get training in the evening,
and so they can get a better

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:28.500
job.&nbsp; That's all quite a big
tangent.&nbsp; Anna Julia Cooper,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.700
the leading black feminist
theorist of her day and

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:38.500
educator, exemplified this
uplift ideology espoused by

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.267
the NACW, and she made
all of this quite clear,

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:46.400
as early as 1892, even
before the NACW was formed.&nbsp;

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.267
There's a, There's an
interesting history behind

00:36:48.267 --> 00:36:52.167
NACW, two different black
women's organizations trying

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:53.800
to fight it out over
which would be the one to

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.900
represent the race, and
they merged in the NACW.&nbsp; In

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:01.700
1892, years before
the NACW is formed,

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:04.600
years before the American
Negro Academy is formed,

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.200
Anna Julia Cooper
writes her manifesto,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.300
A Voice from the
South.&nbsp; It's a long book,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.300
very important.&nbsp;
We can reduce it,

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:15.300
at least today, to one
quote.&nbsp; Cooper says,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.200
in A Voice from the South,
"Only the black woman can

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.800
say where and when I
enter, in the quiet,

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.467
undisputed dignity
of my womanhood,

00:37:33.467 --> 00:37:37.767
without violence and without
suing or special patronage,

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:40.567
then and there the whole
Negro race enters with me."

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.467
"Only the black
woman," I repeat,

00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:47.300
"Only the black woman can
say where and when I enter,

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.167
in the quiet, undisputed
dignity of my womanhood,

00:37:50.167 --> 00:37:53.600
without violence and without
suing or special patronage,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.100
then and there the whole
Negro race enters with me."

00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:03.300
Women, black women,
black elite women,

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.600
black educated
women, were the ones,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.700
the only ones,
who could say how,

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:20.467
when, and where blacks would
rise up and join society as

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:25.600
rightful members.&nbsp;
Now Alexander Crummell,

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.867
a man of his own time,
recognized Anna Julia

00:38:33.867 --> 00:38:39.967
Cooper's intellect and
her, and her unique skills,

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:44.000
but he was certainly as
conservative on gender lines

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.167
as one might expect.&nbsp; He
certainly would have taken

00:38:47.167 --> 00:38:50.500
issue, or took issue with
the idea that it was women

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.900
upon whom this
burden was placed,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.400
to uplift the race.&nbsp; So
there's a sort of gendered

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.067
battle there about who it
was most prepared to save

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:02.267
the race.

00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:04.967
But Cooper and Crummell
shared the same ideology.

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:10.167
It's the educated person,
the civilized person,

00:39:10.167 --> 00:39:14.600
that's who would save the
race.&nbsp; Uplift is a middle

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.600
class ideology then that
was as much about race

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:24.400
management as it was about
anything else.&nbsp; Who was

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.567
going to manage the
race during a period of

00:39:26.567 --> 00:39:31.400
transition?&nbsp;
Post-Reconstruction,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:36.800
era of Redemption, an era
of the destruction of black

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:44.100
male voting rights.&nbsp; Cooper
declares that since women

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:48.167
were
perfectively respectable,

00:39:48.167 --> 00:39:55.900
a certain kind of woman,
that they were the ones who

00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:58.400
would be the
best race managers,

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.200
who could espouse a Talented
Tenth ideology and help

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.600
navigate the race to a
better way of living.&nbsp;

00:40:10.067 --> 00:40:14.167
Respectability is something
that you really need to

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:16.467
linger on here, as well,
throughout all of this.&nbsp;

00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:20.500
It's the reflection of
a bourgeois vision that

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.400
vacillates between an attack
on the failure of America to

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.867
live up to its liberal
ideals of equality and

00:40:25.867 --> 00:40:29.500
justice.&nbsp; Think about Ida B.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:34.800
Wells, that the white South
lacked a proper notion of

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.300
respectable behavior,
because it was lynching

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:42.800
these people.&nbsp; So
respectability could

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.100
vacillate between an attack
on the failure of America to

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:46.467
live up to its
liberal ideals,

00:40:46.467 --> 00:40:47.467
like Ida B.

00:40:47.467 --> 00:40:51.800
Wells did, or respectability
could be used as an attack

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.967
on the values of lifestyles
of the very blacks who

00:40:54.967 --> 00:40:57.167
transgressed this white
middle class propriety.&nbsp; It

00:40:57.167 --> 00:41:04.200
cuts both ways.&nbsp;
People like Ida B.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.500
Wells could tell
white America,

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:11.100
"Shame on you for being so
cowardly when you brandished

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:15.867
the whip and threatened with
the lynching mob."&nbsp; Ida B.

00:41:15.867 --> 00:41:19.667
Wells could also tell
black Americans she believed

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:21.100
beneath her--this
wasn't really Ida B.

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.400
Wells's style,
but I'm taking,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:26.900
extending the point--"Shame
on you for acting in ways

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:30.900
that are improper." Now I
opened this lecture with

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.900
a quote from Alexander
Crummell about the need for

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:37.600
civilization, sketched out
Crummell's life experiences

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.367
and explained why he's
such a great representative

00:41:40.367 --> 00:41:46.267
figure for the era.&nbsp; Let me
close with a quote from his

00:41:46.267 --> 00:41:47.267
protégé, W.

00:41:47.267 --> 00:41:48.267
E.

00:41:48.267 --> 00:41:49.267
B.

00:41:49.267 --> 00:41:52.300
Du Bois.&nbsp; This will be one
of the main figures I'll

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:56.700
focus on in--on Wednesday's
lecture.&nbsp; We can see in this

00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:00.567
quote the way in which the
ideology of the Talented

00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.200
Tenth was driven by
commitment to uplift the

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.967
race and that this
commitment to uplift the

00:42:05.967 --> 00:42:09.567
race was driven by the
belief that the black poor,

00:42:09.567 --> 00:42:12.500
the black unwashed, were a
negative drain on all blacks

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:17.300
in America.&nbsp; Again, uplift
was race management.&nbsp; And by

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.500
the way, for those of you
who know a thing or two

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.500
about W.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.500
E.

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.500
B.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.500
Du Bois and the
phrase Talented Tenth,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.767
these two are linked,
because Du Bois does write

00:42:23.767 --> 00:42:26.467
about the Talented Tenth,
but he's not the person who

00:42:26.467 --> 00:42:30.067
coins the phrase.&nbsp; He uses
it from Morehouse's American

00:42:30.067 --> 00:42:32.400
Baptist Home
Mission Society,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:36.200
just so you're straight
on this issue.&nbsp; Anyway,

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.267
Du Bois says the
following: "Men of America,

00:42:41.267 --> 00:42:44.667
the problem is
plain before you.

00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:46.900
Here is a race transplanted
through the criminal

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:50.900
foolishness of your fathers.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.767
Whether you like it or
not the millions are here,

00:42:53.767 --> 00:42:55.967
and here they will remain.

00:42:55.967 --> 00:43:00.800
If you do not lift them
up, they will pull you down.

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:06.300
Education and work are the
levers to uplift a people.

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:09.300
Work alone will not do it
unless inspired by the right

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.700
ideals and guided
by intelligence.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:16.500
Education must not
simply teach work,

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.500
it must teach Life.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.367
The Talented Tenth of the
Negro race must be made

00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:24.900
leaders of thought and
missionaries of culture

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:27.100
among their people.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.800
No others can do this work,
and Negro colleges must

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:34.500
train
them--train men for it.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.467
The Negro race,
like all other races,

00:43:36.467 --> 00:43:40.000
is going to be saved by
its exceptional men."

00:43:42.367 --> 00:43:44.400
Okay, I'll stop there, and
we'll begin on Wednesday

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.900
talking about--we'll focus
on Wednesday talking about

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.600
Du Bois and his
great foil, Booker T.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:53.000
Washington, and all of
the different competing

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.967
ideologies that are
expressed in this time of

00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:57.600
incredible change for
black America.&nbsp; Thank you.

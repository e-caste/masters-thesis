00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.985
Prof: This is the
beginning of the French part of

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:04.570
the course.
 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.973
Today I'm going to talk about
the Enlightenment and the

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:13.050
cultural concomitants of the
French Revolution,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.283
and how people began to imagine
an alternate sense of

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:22.640
sovereignty in the nation.
 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.976
You're in for a treat on
Monday, because I have one of

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:31.640
the only bootlegged copies of
the live speech and then the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.850
execution of Louis XVI.
 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.657
I'm going to play that and also
the death of Citizen Marat in

00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:40.640
the bathtub at the hands of
Charlotte Corday.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.320
That will be on Monday.
 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.087
Then I'll talk
about--inevitably,

00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:50.450
though I don't particularly
like him--Napoleon on Wednesday.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.410
The next three times are about
la belle France,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.390
but because the Revolution is
terribly important and,

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.770
indeed, in lots of ways in many
places--it's well worth doing.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.930
So, I'm going to do four things
today.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.221
I'm going to first talk about
your basic outline of what

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.110
difference the Enlightenment
made,

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:20.542
followed by--with reference to
my good friend Bob Darnton's

00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.968
work,
The Social History of

00:01:22.968 --> 00:01:25.661
Ideas--and look at
surprising ways that

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.970
Enlightenment influence was
felt.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.394
I'm not talking about the
big-time people like Rousseau

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:34.060
and Voltaire,
but the Grub Street hacks.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.833
Then I'm going to talk a little
bit about the public sphere,

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:39.239
taking two examples.
 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.953
One from the work of David Bell
and one from the work of Sarah

00:01:41.953 --> 00:01:45.114
Maza,
in which you can see this

00:01:45.114 --> 00:01:50.726
emergence of this possibly
different way of viewing

00:01:50.726 --> 00:01:57.010
sovereignty residing in the
nation and not in a king.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.489
Then look again at what
difference, in a very strange

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:03.500
way, the Enlightenment made in
all of this.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.780
First, the kind of classic
stuff, just to review for you.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.437
If you had to summarize six
ways that the Enlightenment

00:02:13.437 --> 00:02:17.060
mattered, you might list them
like this.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.878
First of all, without question,
Enlightenment thought--although

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.509
the Enlightenment thinkers
disagreed on many things,

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:26.110
and a few were atheists,
but not many,

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.317
most were Deists and believed
that God was everywhere--the

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:34.818
Enlightenment did weaken the
hold of traditional religion,

00:02:34.818 --> 00:02:39.205
particularly the role of the
Catholic Church as a public

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:41.120
institution in France.
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.712
Of course, if you read in
high-school French or wherever

00:02:44.712 --> 00:02:47.303
Candide,
which is blatantly

00:02:47.303 --> 00:02:49.580
antireligious,
of Voltaire,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.650
you'll see the most extreme
example of that.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.454
Secondly, and related to this,
Enlightenment thinkers taught a

00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:03.116
secular code of ethics,
one that was divorced from

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:05.210
religious beliefs.
 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.449
That they were engaged with
humanity.

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.340
They loved humanity.
 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.174
They thought people were
basically good,

00:03:12.174 --> 00:03:16.533
and this shouldn't be just a
valley of tears awaiting eternal

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:19.658
life, and went out to make such
claims.

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:25.437
Third is that they developed a
critical spirit of analysis not

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.280
to accept routine tradition.
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.199
Truths that were passed down
from generation to generation,

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:40.145
particularly those passed down
by the religious establishment

00:03:40.145 --> 00:03:44.110
and--not to accept routine
tradition,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.348
such, for example,
routine hierarchies.

00:03:48.348 --> 00:03:53.258
This was part of their spirit
of analysis.

00:03:53.258 --> 00:03:58.203
Fourth, they were curious about
history and believed in

00:03:58.203 --> 00:03:59.210
progress.
 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.526
They were convinced that France
had a special role to play in

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:04.030
this.
 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.340
To be sure, the Enlightenment
was to be found in many places

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.840
in Europe, and in what became
the United States.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.410
Paris particularly played a
central role in that.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.319
Fifth, that they differentiated
absolutism from despotism.

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.963
In order to understand what
happens in this remarkable

00:04:30.963 --> 00:04:35.519
series of events in 1789 and in
subsequent years,

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:37.461
as I said before,
there weren't ten people in

00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:39.579
France who considered themselves
republicans,

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:43.687
that is who wanted a republic
in 1789 and how it was that two

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:48.026
or three years later,
in 1793 it became easy for the

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:53.420
majority of the population to
imagine a life without any king

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.319
at all.
 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.819
Sixth--and here's the role of
the Grub Street hacks,

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.935
of the third division of
Enlightenment thinkers that I'll

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:06.608
talk about in just a few
minutes--they heaped abuse

00:05:06.608 --> 00:05:10.209
against what they considered to
be unearned,

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.726
unjustified privilege,
and--;how can one put

00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:22.617
this--disrespected the monarchy
and the nobles who hung around

00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:24.170
the king.
 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.853
One can say in hindsight,
because we know what happened

00:05:27.853 --> 00:05:31.079
next,
that the Enlightenment helped

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:36.685
prepare the way for the French
Revolution and that the French

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:41.235
Revolution transferred power,
transferred authority to people

00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:43.459
who were very influenced by the
Enlightenment.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:44.810
The classic example which I
will give,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.839
because I enjoy talking about
him so much and he is important,

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:52.149
is Maximilian Robespierre,
who in many ways was a child of

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:53.420
the philosophes.
 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.706
As you know,
the philosophes,

00:05:54.706 --> 00:05:56.838
which is such an important word
in French, became a word in

00:05:56.838 --> 00:05:57.279
English.
 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.350
The philosophes were the
thinkers of the Enlightenment.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.072
Robespierre,
born in Arras in the northern

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:07.262
part of France and now what is
the Pas de Calais,

00:06:07.262 --> 00:06:10.850
was very much influenced by
Enlightenment thought.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.867
As the twelve of the Committee
of Public Safety sat around that

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:18.949
big green table making decisions
that affected the lives of lots

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:23.115
of people in France,
Enlightenment influence was

00:06:23.115 --> 00:06:24.720
certainly there.
 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.610
The Enlightenment stretched
across frontiers.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.081
I think there's a map in the
second edition of the book that

00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:37.629
you are kindly reading where you
can find copies of Diderot's

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.449
famous encyclopedia.
 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:40.709
You could find it in South
Africa.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.440
You could find it in Moscow.
 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.509
You could find it in
Philadelphia.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.040
You could find it in New York.
 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.850
You could find it in papal Rome.
 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.490
You could find it all over the
place.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.379
One thing that's interesting is
that twenty or thirty years ago,

00:06:57.379 --> 00:07:00.091
when I was starting out,
when people did what they used

00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:03.687
to call intellectual history,
intellectual history was the

00:07:03.687 --> 00:07:04.470
big ideas.
 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.230
You call it the Via Regia of
history,

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.846
where you've got one idea
moving along and it hooks up

00:07:10.846 --> 00:07:14.413
with another idea,
and then a third idea comes as

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.050
a result of that idea.
 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.822
It's rather like traditional
art history where you try to

00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:23.528
discover where it is that
Pizarro got his red ochre as a

00:07:23.528 --> 00:07:26.634
color,
or where such and such a

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:32.550
Baroque painter got the idea of
painting cherubs in a certain

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.240
way.
 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.281
In the very early â€˜70s,
my colleague,

00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:40.029
retired a long time,
a great historian Peter Gay,

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:43.149
coined the phrase "the
social history of ideas."

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:44.850
Ideas, too, have a history.
 

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.680
Who understood Rousseau?
 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.610
Who read Voltaire?
 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.339
Who read the Encyclopedia of
Diderot?

00:07:54.339 --> 00:07:59.290
How do we know how these ideas
were used?

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.509
He called for the social
history of ideas.

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.427
A number of people,
including Bob Darnton who is

00:08:04.427 --> 00:08:06.937
now at Harvard,
but taught at Princeton for

00:08:06.937 --> 00:08:10.726
decades and who turned out the
finest historians of old regime

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:12.980
France,
took this very seriously.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.968
So did another friend of mine,
Danielle Roche,

00:08:15.968 --> 00:08:18.360
who did work on the
académies,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.620
which I'll discuss in a while.
 

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.040
They began to look at how
Enlightenment ideas got around.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.288
How did copies of
Candide,

00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:30.100
which was illegal in France,
censored.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.500
How did these things turn up in
France?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.620
Let me just say a couple things
about this.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:47.980
Enlightenment ideas really came
into elite popular opinion,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.509
in what we call the public
sphere--that is,

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.548
people who are interested in
ideas,

00:08:52.548 --> 00:08:55.975
and people who became
interested in politics--in

00:08:55.975 --> 00:08:58.600
really three major ways in
France.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.470
There are equivalents of these
in other place.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:03.702
The Scottish example because
the Scottish Enlightenment is

00:09:03.702 --> 00:09:04.370
very important.
 

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.629
You can read about it in the
book.

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.019
One of these will be quite
clear there.

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:11.929
First, through,
académies.

00:09:11.929 --> 00:09:15.860
An academy was not a university.
 

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.990
It has nothing to do with a
university.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.558
They still exist.
 

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:22.341
I'm a member of one of these
academies, an obscure one in the

00:09:22.341 --> 00:09:23.129
Ardèche.
 

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:28.996
An academy was a group of
erudites, sometimes including

00:09:28.996 --> 00:09:33.778
clergy, many nobles,
many bourgeois people of

00:09:33.778 --> 00:09:35.298
education.
 

00:09:35.298 --> 00:09:39.442
The population that was
literate increases in Western

00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:43.029
Europe decidedly in the
eighteenth century.

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:45.710
They would get together and
discuss ideas.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.227
They had contests where people
who wanted to make a little

00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:51.883
money would answer a question
put out by the

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:53.548
académie.
 

00:09:53.548 --> 00:09:59.841
They would write responses to
questions about science,

00:09:59.841 --> 00:10:02.928
religion, and big ideas.
 

00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:06.120
Robespierre wins one of these
contests.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.356
These académies meet in
smaller rooms than this,

00:10:10.356 --> 00:10:12.320
but they discuss ideas.
 

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.339
These ideas are putting in
sharp analysis,

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:20.750
or re-evaluation,
the role of the church as an

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.320
institution.
 

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.899
They have to get around some
way.

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.000
People have to know about them.
 

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.230
The academy is one way this
happened.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.604
A second one,
moving to number three,

00:10:30.604 --> 00:10:31.990
are Masonic lodges.
 

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.620
Masonic lodges still exist.
 

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.225
There's one,
I don't know if it's still

00:10:35.225 --> 00:10:37.591
active, but there's a big
Masonic building out on Whitney

00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:38.308
on the right.
 

00:10:38.308 --> 00:10:39.990
I think it became an insurance
building.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:43.330
One of the horrors of my
seventh grade life was having to

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.193
be dragged off to the dancing
school in Portland,

00:10:46.193 --> 00:10:48.898
Oregon,
which met in a large building

00:10:48.898 --> 00:10:50.750
which was a Masonic lodge.
 

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:55.070
Masonic lodges begin in
Scotland.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:11:01.126
They are secularizing
institutions that the members

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:04.727
mostly all agree,
agreed in the eighteenth

00:11:04.727 --> 00:11:07.126
century,
that the church's public

00:11:07.126 --> 00:11:09.908
institution role is too
important.

00:11:09.908 --> 00:11:13.570
Masonic lodges talk about these
ideas as well.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.048
They talk about Rousseau,
Diderot, Montesquieu,

00:11:16.048 --> 00:11:17.450
and all of these people.
 

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:22.830
This is a second way in which
these ideas get out.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.350
The third is the salon.
 

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.756
There's another French word
that's so important it became an

00:11:26.756 --> 00:11:27.370
English word.
 

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.726
A salon was a gathering of
pretty elite people,

00:11:30.726 --> 00:11:33.720
but interested in the life of
the mind.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.394
They were hosted by hostesses,
again, the role of women in the

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:39.620
Enlightenment.
 

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:42.164
I give you in the book the
example of Madame Geoffrin,

00:11:42.164 --> 00:11:43.509
which was the classic one.
 

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:46.610
People would come together to
eat, to drink,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.269
and to discuss ideas.
 

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:51.047
When British guests came to
Paris, the salons,

00:11:51.047 --> 00:11:54.009
they said, "All they do is
eat and drink.

00:11:54.009 --> 00:11:55.828
They spend all their time
eating and drinking,

00:11:55.828 --> 00:11:57.730
and they don't discuss ideas
that much."

00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:59.220
In fact, they did.
 

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.005
There's still a wonderful
place in Paris called the

00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:04.881
Palais Royal where you can go,
and on very hot days--in the

00:12:04.881 --> 00:12:06.980
eighteenth century,
in the 1770s,

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:11.510
you can imagine people meeting
there talking about the ideas of

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.634
young Enlightenment hotshots,
those people who have become

00:12:16.634 --> 00:12:20.908
part of the canon of western
civilization.

00:12:20.908 --> 00:12:24.340
This is another way where these
ideas get along.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.923
Young, would-be
philosophes on the make

00:12:26.923 --> 00:12:30.211
coming up from the provinces,
what they want to do is be

00:12:30.211 --> 00:12:33.340
introduced to one of these
hostesses so that they will be

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:36.301
invited to trot out their
intellectual wares at one of

00:12:36.301 --> 00:12:37.529
these gatherings.
 

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:41.121
These are concrete examples of
the way that these ideas got

00:12:41.121 --> 00:12:41.678
around.
 

00:12:41.678 --> 00:12:44.174
People didn't pay any attention
to this before about thirty,

00:12:44.174 --> 00:12:45.190
thirty-five years ago.
 

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.100
Danielle Roche's book on the
académies,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:53.010
two huge volumes not
translated, are really marvelous

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.440
in all of that.
 

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.279
That's something to keep in
mind.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:13:01.557
The high Enlightenment really
ends in 1778,

00:13:01.557 --> 00:13:03.570
traditionally.
 

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.629
That's a textbook kind of date.
 

00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:09.029
But it does matter,
because that's when Voltaire

00:13:09.029 --> 00:13:12.070
and his great enemy,
Rousseau, both die.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:15.509
After that, there are no more
Montesquieus,

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:18.868
or Voltaires,
or the big-time all stars of

00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:21.080
the philosophes.
 

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.440
There aren't any more.
 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.389
But there is this next
generation of would-be

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:28.407
philosophes,
people who could think and

00:13:28.407 --> 00:13:31.288
write and who want to hit the
big time.

00:13:31.288 --> 00:13:36.316
They see that Voltaire made big
bucks, big francs,

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.740
big livre writing.
 

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.740
They want to be like him.
 

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.149
They want to be like Voltaire.
 

00:13:43.149 --> 00:13:46.736
They want to be like Rousseau,
his archenemy who paced around

00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:50.650
his little farm called Les
Charmettes in Savoy outside of

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.288
Chambéry,
and who hated Voltaire.

00:13:54.288 --> 00:13:56.230
They really couldn't stand each
other.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.210
But he also hit the big time.
 

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:03.225
What the Grub Street hacks,
Grub Street refers to--I don't

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:06.894
know if it's a real street or
imaginary street in London where

00:14:06.894 --> 00:14:10.384
lots of would-be writers and
writers who are peddling their

00:14:10.384 --> 00:14:11.769
wares hung around.
 

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:16.003
These Grub Street hacks,
the third division of people

00:14:16.003 --> 00:14:20.888
who want to have the kind of
entry into the salon life to put

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:22.678
forth their ideas.
 

00:14:22.678 --> 00:14:25.908
They live on the top floor,
where the poorest people live.

00:14:25.908 --> 00:14:28.720
They're dodging their landlords
all the time.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.980
They don't have enough money to
pay.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.538
A lot of them live in Paris
around now around Odéon.

00:14:33.538 --> 00:14:35.149
It doesn't matter if you know
Odéon at all,

00:14:35.149 --> 00:14:38.350
but they live right around that
part in the Latin Quarter,

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:42.764
but more in what now is the
Sixth Arrondissement,

00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:44.330
and they write.
 

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.289
But what do they write about?
 

00:14:45.289 --> 00:14:47.110
They need to make money.
 

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.186
The big news here,
as Darnton discovered,

00:14:50.186 --> 00:14:52.340
is they write pornography.
 

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.210
They write scatological
pornography.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.149
They write what they call in
French libelles. They

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.315
write broadsides,
really, denouncing the royal

00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:05.340
family, denouncing the queen
above all.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:09.379
Indelibly called "the
Austrian whore"

00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:13.418
by her many detractors,
who are omnipresent.

00:15:13.418 --> 00:15:17.250
They write against what they
think is unearned privilege,

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.080
the kind of censorship that
they see is keeping them from

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.788
hitting the big time.
 

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:26.919
The point of Darnton's many
wonderful books is that in the

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:29.566
long run,
although these people were the

00:15:29.566 --> 00:15:32.171
Grub Street hacks,
Voltaire denigrated them as

00:15:32.171 --> 00:15:35.789
the canaille,
the rabble, the scribblers,

00:15:35.789 --> 00:15:41.977
jealous, eager, anxious,
hungry--;is that their attacks

00:15:41.977 --> 00:15:46.429
on the regime and against the
unearned privilege,

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:50.977
as they saw it,
helps erode belief in the

00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:54.157
monarchy,
and helps suggest that the

00:15:54.157 --> 00:15:58.490
monarchy itself and the people
hanging around the monarchy at

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:01.379
Versailles is lapsing into
despotism.

00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:04.509
So, they do make a difference.
 

00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:06.230
Let me give you an example.
 

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:07.850
This is sort of a classic one.
 

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.769
Imagine you're a bookseller in
Poitiers.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:15.985
Poitiers is a very nice town
full of lovely old romance

00:16:15.985 --> 00:16:19.558
churches in central western
France.

00:16:19.558 --> 00:16:25.274
You are writing to Switzerland
to order books that you want to

00:16:25.274 --> 00:16:30.240
sell to people who have ordered
books, for example.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.187
He writes the following letter:
"Here is a short list of

00:16:34.187 --> 00:16:36.818
philosophical books (books
written by the

00:16:36.818 --> 00:16:39.779
philosophes) that I want
to order.

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:42.480
Please send the invoice in
advance.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.187
They include:
Venus and the Cloister,

00:16:45.187 --> 00:16:47.769
or, The Nun in the
Nightgown;

00:16:47.769 --> 00:16:51.673
Christianity Unveiled (that
could be the subtitle,

00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:53.922
too);
Memories of Madame la

00:16:53.922 --> 00:16:57.821
Marquise de Pompadour;
Inquiry on the Origins of

00:16:57.821 --> 00:17:01.019
Oriental Despotism;
The System of Nature;

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:04.759
Teresa the Philosopher;
Margot the Camp Follower.

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:09.029
This is not exactly the stuff
of Diderot, Voltaire,

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:12.019
Rousseau, and these other
people.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:16.605
But yet, those who penned such
things imagined that they were

00:17:16.605 --> 00:17:21.191
philosophes and wanted to
have the same kind of impact

00:17:21.191 --> 00:17:24.019
that Voltaire and the others
had.

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:28.628
These were la canaille,
the kind of rabble of Grub

00:17:28.628 --> 00:17:29.368
Street.
 

00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:32.680
Why was he writing Switzerland
to begin with?

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.828
Again, this is the question of
how do these ideas get around?

00:17:36.828 --> 00:17:40.115
One of the things that the Grub
Street hacks didn't like is that

00:17:40.115 --> 00:17:41.210
you've got censors.
 

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.585
You've got paid censors who
work for the government who say,

00:17:43.585 --> 00:17:44.953
"This can't be
published"

00:17:44.953 --> 00:17:45.720
or "Un-uh.
 

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.549
You shouldn't have published
that baby.

00:17:47.549 --> 00:17:49.819
That wasn't a good idea."
 

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:55.049
The result is,
in a system in which privilege,

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:58.478
of which monopolies,
of which guilds controlled the

00:17:58.478 --> 00:18:01.618
production and distribution of
almost everything,

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:05.146
that book-selling and
book-printing are monopolies

00:18:05.146 --> 00:18:07.019
controlled by the state.
 

00:18:07.019 --> 00:18:10.118
So, if you're a Parisian
printer,

00:18:10.118 --> 00:18:12.960
unless you're risking being
thrown in the slammer,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.678
the slammer (that's not
a real word in French,

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:22.105
obviously),
you can't print this stuff out

00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:23.578
in Paris.
 

00:18:23.578 --> 00:18:26.718
So much of the Enlightenment
literature is published

00:18:26.718 --> 00:18:30.410
in--you'll not be shocked to
know--you already know this,

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:35.349
Amsterdam, or in Brussels,
in the southern Netherlands,

00:18:35.349 --> 00:18:37.568
or Switzerland.
 

00:18:37.568 --> 00:18:40.489
Bob Darnton,
when he was a young professor,

00:18:40.489 --> 00:18:44.588
before that a young graduate
student, he hit the jackpot.

00:18:44.588 --> 00:18:48.368
A lot of the stuff was printed
in Switzerland in Neufchatel,

00:18:48.368 --> 00:18:52.150
and he got hold of the archives
of this printing company.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.549
He was able to do the social
history of ideas.

00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:57.788
Who bought what?
 

00:18:57.788 --> 00:19:02.528
By the way, before the Ryan Air
or any of these places,

00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:06.950
how do you get all of this
stuff from Switzerland,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.819
where there are big mountains,
into France?

00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:11.619
How do you get it to Poitiers?
 

00:19:11.619 --> 00:19:14.048
How do you get it there?
 

00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:16.625
Again, you have to look at the
way that this stuff is

00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.318
distributed.
 

00:19:17.318 --> 00:19:19.220
The ideas, we've already seen
how they were distributed,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.568
but how literally do you get
these books,

00:19:21.568 --> 00:19:23.009
these bouquins,
these pamphlets,

00:19:23.009 --> 00:19:26.598
these brochures from
Switzerland or the equivalent,

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.940
from Amsterdam or
Brussels--that's easier,

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.938
a flat country is a little
different than mountains--into

00:19:31.938 --> 00:19:32.420
France?
 

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.278
Well, in France,
as in the German states,

00:19:35.278 --> 00:19:37.779
as in Italy,
there were peddlers.

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:38.828
There were peddlers.
 

00:19:38.828 --> 00:19:42.269
They would go on the road and
they had--like a medicine ball

00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:45.068
in a gym, they'd have these huge
leather bags.

00:19:45.068 --> 00:19:48.893
They'd be stuffed with all
sorts of things--pens and pins

00:19:48.893 --> 00:19:53.126
and--I think I mentioned this is
another context--and religious

00:19:53.126 --> 00:19:56.910
literature,
but also hidden at the bottom,

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:59.269
beneath the religious
literature,

00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:04.589
they are smuggling into France
Enlightenment literature.

00:20:04.589 --> 00:20:08.640
They have drop-off points.
 

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.836
They go over the Jura
Mountains, that's not so easy to

00:20:11.836 --> 00:20:15.333
do, and they take them to a city
like Chaumont in the east,

00:20:15.333 --> 00:20:16.598
or Metz or Nancy.
 

00:20:16.598 --> 00:20:19.298
Then somebody else carries the
stuff all the way.

00:20:19.298 --> 00:20:21.660
Avoiding the police around
Paris,

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.752
the gendarmerie,
the

00:20:22.752 --> 00:20:25.098
maréchaussées
as they were called then,

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:31.050
this stuff, Margot the Camp
Follower ends up pleasing

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:37.511
this drooling guy in Poitiers,
who can buy it from his

00:20:37.511 --> 00:20:39.009
bookstore.
 

00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:42.501
You can really follow not only
Diderot's encyclopedia--and how

00:20:42.501 --> 00:20:45.250
do we know where Diderot's
encyclopedia ended up,

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.108
by the way?
 

00:20:46.108 --> 00:20:49.338
Well, for example,
people who leave wills,

00:20:49.338 --> 00:20:51.972
that's how we know about
literature in the nineteenth

00:20:51.972 --> 00:20:54.753
century,
because the libraries in

00:20:54.753 --> 00:20:58.987
estates would be detailed,
so we know what books people

00:20:58.987 --> 00:20:59.279
had.
 

00:20:59.279 --> 00:21:03.084
In the eighteenth century we
have a tremendous proliferation

00:21:03.084 --> 00:21:05.211
of ideas, of reading,
of literacy,

00:21:05.211 --> 00:21:07.920
and of ways of discussing these
ideas.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.931
I've already mentioned three of
them there, but if you look at

00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.450
the case of Britain,
you've got the coffeehouses.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.160
Coffeehouses follow the mania
of coffee.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.680
Coffee comes from where?
 

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.788
The colonies.
 

00:21:18.788 --> 00:21:23.090
So, coffeehouses are part of
this sort of globalization of

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.940
the economy, but also the
globalization of ideas.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:29.318
This stuff all kind of fits
together.

00:21:29.318 --> 00:21:34.890
Again, Voltaire,
Rousseau, Montesquieu,

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:38.155
and Diderot and the others
would be just horrified to think

00:21:38.155 --> 00:21:41.704
that anybody intellectual would
be mentioning some of these Grub

00:21:41.704 --> 00:21:45.073
Street hacks along with them,
because they didn't accept them

00:21:45.073 --> 00:21:47.230
and nor were they of the same
quality at all.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:49.630
Some of these guys, by the way,
there's one who I mention in

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.507
the book,
a guy called Brissot,

00:21:52.507 --> 00:21:55.673
B-R-I-S-S-O-T,
who becomes an important leader

00:21:55.673 --> 00:21:58.099
of a faction in the Revolution
called the Girondins,

00:21:58.099 --> 00:22:00.958
from around Bordeaux,
who are against the Jacobins.

00:22:00.958 --> 00:22:02.210
More about that later.
 

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:03.848
Brissot is broke.
 

00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:05.119
How is he going to pay the
landlord?

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:06.368
He has no idea.
 

00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:08.220
Where is he going to get his
next drink?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.240
What does he do?
 

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.880
He works for the police.
 

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.925
He works as a police informer
on the other would-be

00:22:13.925 --> 00:22:16.789
philosophes,
on the Grub Street hacks.

00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:17.740
How do we know this?
 

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.646
Darnton found the dossier in
which Brissot is being paid off

00:22:21.646 --> 00:22:22.838
by these people.
 

00:22:22.838 --> 00:22:25.249
What are other ways that we
know how many of these

00:22:25.249 --> 00:22:26.430
characters there were?
 

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.349
There were about 200 to 300.
 

00:22:27.349 --> 00:22:28.539
I don't remember exactly.
 

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:29.279
Why?
 

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.588
Because they want money.
 

00:22:30.588 --> 00:22:32.911
On one hand they say,
"I don't like this

00:22:32.911 --> 00:22:35.813
censorship, it's keeping people
from recognizing my true

00:22:35.813 --> 00:22:36.710
genius."
 

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.355
On the other hand they write
little sniveling letters saying,

00:22:39.355 --> 00:22:41.558
"I am a writer and a very
good one, indeed.

00:22:41.558 --> 00:22:43.890
Therefore, I merit a state
pension."

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:46.998
They write these letters to the
various equivalents of

00:22:46.998 --> 00:22:48.904
ministries,
saying, "Please give me

00:22:48.904 --> 00:22:51.465
some money,
because I am a really wonderful

00:22:51.465 --> 00:22:54.318
writer and instead of repressing
my work,

00:22:54.318 --> 00:22:56.108
you should be saluting my
genius."

00:22:56.108 --> 00:23:00.923
They write clammy letters like
that, that you find in the

00:23:00.923 --> 00:23:01.868
archives.
 

00:23:01.868 --> 00:23:05.220
We piece this stuff together
gradually.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.775
Let me just race over here and
give you just an example

00:23:11.775 --> 00:23:16.509
of--where is this stuff?--here
we go.

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:18.160
What would Voltaire think of
this?

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:23.068
Here is one of these pamphlets
that's denouncing the

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:26.150
high-livers out at Versailles.
 

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:29.476
"The public is warned that
an epidemic disease is raging

00:23:29.476 --> 00:23:32.686
among the girls of the opera,
that has begun to reach the

00:23:32.686 --> 00:23:35.773
ladies of the court and that has
been communicated to their

00:23:35.773 --> 00:23:36.358
lackeys.
 

00:23:36.358 --> 00:23:39.982
This disease elongates the
face, destroys the complexion,

00:23:39.982 --> 00:23:42.959
reduces the weight,
and causes horrible ravages

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:44.900
where it becomes situated.
 

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.079
There are ladies without teeth,
others without eyebrows,

00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:50.740
and some are now completely
paralyzed."

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.308
People want to know what it is.
 

00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:53.980
It's obviously a venereal
disease.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.150
He's obviously exaggerating
the--who knows?

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.410
I don't know--but the results
of such a malady.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.074
What he's doing is he's
suggesting that what's really

00:24:04.074 --> 00:24:07.046
going on at Versailles is lots
of people--how do I put this

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:09.965
politely?--hooking up all over
the place at the petites

00:24:09.965 --> 00:24:12.663
réunions,
while they're dressing up as

00:24:12.663 --> 00:24:15.827
peasants, or whatever,
and that the result is very

00:24:15.827 --> 00:24:20.359
demeaning for the French state
and for the French monarchy.

00:24:20.359 --> 00:24:21.299
So, does this have an effect?
 

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:22.269
It does.
 

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:23.118
It really does.
 

00:24:23.118 --> 00:24:28.365
It contributes to what has been
called the desacralization of

00:24:28.365 --> 00:24:30.288
the French monarchy.
 

00:24:30.288 --> 00:24:35.301
It is very hard to argue that
God has put absolute monarchs on

00:24:35.301 --> 00:24:39.656
earth to bring people better
lives if you've got these

00:24:39.656 --> 00:24:44.670
people--and ordinary people did
not get into Versailles,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.568
unless they were among the
15,000 lackeys working there.

00:24:48.568 --> 00:24:52.190
Lackeys would be the term given
by the people who employed them.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.180
You didn't know.
 

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.440
You had to surmise.
 

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.578
You had to guess what was going
on.

00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.875
I'll give you a couple of
examples in a while,

00:24:59.875 --> 00:25:02.935
and I'd better hurry up and do
this, in which you can kind of

00:25:02.935 --> 00:25:04.108
see how this works.
 

00:25:04.108 --> 00:25:06.472
I'll give you kind of a
spectacularly interesting

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:08.588
example, at least I think so,
at the end.

00:25:08.588 --> 00:25:13.472
By the way, just as an aside,
during the French Revolution

00:25:13.472 --> 00:25:16.900
Louis XVI decides to get the
hell out.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.175
He and Marie Antoinette,
improbably, dress themselves up

00:25:21.175 --> 00:25:22.808
as ordinary people.
 

00:25:22.808 --> 00:25:26.028
They're not people who have to
set the alarm clock usually.

00:25:26.028 --> 00:25:28.961
They get up at 3:00 in the
morning and they get into this

00:25:28.961 --> 00:25:31.788
large carriage that's been
stuffed with silver and foie

00:25:31.788 --> 00:25:33.828
gras and all sorts of other
things.

00:25:33.828 --> 00:25:36.807
They hightail it toward what is
now the Belgian frontier,

00:25:36.807 --> 00:25:39.038
but they get further and
further behind.

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:40.869
You can read about this when
you get to that chapter.

00:25:40.869 --> 00:25:42.809
It's an interesting story.
 

00:25:42.809 --> 00:25:46.960
Finally, they get recognized.
 

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.240
She is not a governess,
she is the queen.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.820
One of the people that first
realizes this is the king has

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.779
actually caught a glimpse of the
king himself by looking through

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:02.109
the fence at Versailles at the
time of a wedding.

00:26:02.109 --> 00:26:03.180
He sees the king.
 

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.150
There aren't photographs.
 

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.480
He recognizes the king's nose.
 

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:08.396
He gets down on his knees and
says, "Sire,

00:26:08.396 --> 00:26:09.440
you are the king."
 

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.732
This guy can no longer pretend
that he's a mere hanger-on

00:26:13.732 --> 00:26:16.108
assisting a Russian baroness.
 

00:26:16.108 --> 00:26:21.538
It's all over but the shoutin'
at that point.

00:26:21.538 --> 00:26:26.710
What these people do is they
helped break down this sense of

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.528
automatic respect for the
monarchy as an institution.

00:26:31.528 --> 00:26:34.953
Of course, the fact that they
can't stand Marie Antoinette

00:26:34.953 --> 00:26:37.959
who, rightly or wrongly,
is accused of all sorts of

00:26:37.959 --> 00:26:38.618
things.
 

00:26:38.618 --> 00:26:43.463
This is racing ahead of the
story, but Louis XVI was a

00:26:43.463 --> 00:26:45.750
big-time cuckolded guy.
 

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.428
His wife was seriously sleeping
around while he was taking apart

00:26:49.428 --> 00:26:51.529
and putting back together
clocks,

00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:56.143
which he liked to do in the big
house when his wife is out in

00:26:56.143 --> 00:27:00.318
the bushes,
to put it crudely.

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.335
I forgot this is being
televised.

00:27:02.335 --> 00:27:03.910
Anyway, take that back.
 

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.190
Can you erase that, please?
 

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.785
Anyway, what these people do is
over the long run this helps

00:27:10.785 --> 00:27:16.344
erode respect for the monarchy,
and helps us explain why it was

00:27:16.344 --> 00:27:20.788
in 1789 you could imagine a
world without a king and a world

00:27:20.788 --> 00:27:22.220
without a queen.
 

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.088
When they bring them back,
they bring the old boy and his

00:27:26.088 --> 00:27:29.400
wife back from Varennes,
which is in the northeast of

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.526
France,
the National Guard turns their

00:27:31.526 --> 00:27:34.048
backs in serious disrespect to
the carriage,

00:27:34.048 --> 00:27:36.210
and they hold their guns upside
down.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.534
At that point,
that's la fin des

00:27:38.534 --> 00:27:41.268
haricots,
the end of the green beans,

00:27:41.268 --> 00:27:43.730
as the French say,
for the king.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:46.250
But this process started
earlier.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:49.478
The third-string hacks of the
Enlightenment had something to

00:27:49.478 --> 00:27:50.190
do with it.
 

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:53.749
Let me give you a couple of
examples also from other

00:27:53.749 --> 00:27:58.076
friends, but really good serious
work has been done in the last

00:27:58.076 --> 00:28:00.309
twenty or twenty-five years.
 

00:28:00.309 --> 00:28:08.950
Rocketing right along here,
let me give you another example

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:15.973
of this relationship of the
public sphere to imagining a new

00:28:15.973 --> 00:28:20.920
source of sovereignty,
that is the nation,

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.538
and give you an example of how
that works.

00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:27.755
This comes from the work of
David Bell, who is my colleague

00:28:27.755 --> 00:28:31.970
and still very dear friend who
teaches at Johns Hopkins.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:36.853
This is from his work on
lawyers in the eighteenth

00:28:36.853 --> 00:28:37.848
century.
 

00:28:37.848 --> 00:28:45.269
We'll give you an example of
how this fits together.

00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:47.818
It fits into the Enlightenment
stuff,

00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:52.458
because if Enlightenment
literature was censored and

00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:56.925
sometimes hard to get hold of,
though an encyclopedia was

00:28:56.925 --> 00:29:00.308
tolerated and then not tolerated
and then tolerated again,

00:29:00.308 --> 00:29:06.374
what Bell's work on lawyers
demonstrates is the way in which

00:29:06.374 --> 00:29:12.848
lawyers and legal briefs help
get these ideas around as well.

00:29:12.848 --> 00:29:16.509
Because you could not censor
legal briefs.

00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:20.368
To give you just an aside,
don't worry about this now.

00:29:20.368 --> 00:29:24.506
In the case of imperial Russia
in the late nineteenth century

00:29:24.506 --> 00:29:27.538
you had big-time censorship by
the police.

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:31.390
In fact, when there were these
political trials,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.759
lots of what was said in the
courtroom got around as well and

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:39.473
couldn't really be censored in
the way that ordinary

00:29:39.473 --> 00:29:41.150
publications could.
 

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:42.848
You had this same sort of
effect there.

00:29:42.848 --> 00:29:45.259
Let me give you a couple
examples.

00:29:45.259 --> 00:29:49.240
They're complicated examples,
but don't worry about them.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:53.698
The first would be from this
very strange not really heresy,

00:29:53.698 --> 00:29:58.231
but I guess the Catholic Church
considered it a heresy called

00:29:58.231 --> 00:29:59.288
Jansenism.
 

00:29:59.288 --> 00:30:01.873
I remember once coming in to do
the equivalent of this lecture

00:30:01.873 --> 00:30:04.288
and having to look at my own
book for a good definition of

00:30:04.288 --> 00:30:06.109
Jansenism that I must have found
once,

00:30:06.109 --> 00:30:07.460
because it's so obscure.
 

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.848
There was a bishop who didn't
think he was obscure,

00:30:09.848 --> 00:30:14.846
but a Belgian bishop called a
Jansen who thought that the

00:30:14.846 --> 00:30:19.130
Catholic Church was becoming too
over-mighty,

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.214
and full of Baroque masses and
huge expenses for archbishops

00:30:23.214 --> 00:30:25.500
who weren't doing a damn thing.
 

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.228
He imagined another kind of
religion and became very

00:30:29.228 --> 00:30:29.960
ascetic.
 

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.720
Somebody once called them
Calvinists who went to mass.

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.021
They were still Catholic,
but they didn't believe in this

00:30:39.021 --> 00:30:40.319
high Baroque church.
 

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:44.058
Jansenism was in 1715 or so.
 

00:30:44.058 --> 00:30:48.430
Then it comes back in the 1760s
or 1770s.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.160
It's extremely boring stuff.
 

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.318
Louis XIV didn't think it was
boring.

00:30:52.318 --> 00:30:55.493
He sent out the troops to burn
down Jansenist abbeys,

00:30:55.493 --> 00:30:58.730
the big one was called
Port-Royal outside of Paris.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:03.184
He thought that this was a
threat to the Galician Church,

00:31:03.184 --> 00:31:08.038
which was sort of the alliance
of the Catholic Church with the

00:31:08.038 --> 00:31:09.868
monarchy in France.
 

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:12.181
Rather like Carthage,
they were supposed to plow salt

00:31:12.181 --> 00:31:13.868
into the land and all this
business.

00:31:13.868 --> 00:31:17.682
So, they wage war on these
Jansenist people,

00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:21.848
who were rather like Calvinists
in many ways.

00:31:21.848 --> 00:31:27.178
But the only point of that is
that there are lawyers who begin

00:31:27.178 --> 00:31:32.332
to defend the Jansenists and
begin to see the actions of the

00:31:32.332 --> 00:31:36.087
king vis-à
vis this persecuted

00:31:36.087 --> 00:31:39.318
religious minority as despotic.
 

00:31:39.318 --> 00:31:42.603
When lawyers are publishing
legal briefs--and there's enough

00:31:42.603 --> 00:31:45.420
references in the book,
so you can put this together,

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:46.759
but I just want you to see the
point.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:50.746
When they begin to publish
legal briefs defending the

00:31:50.746 --> 00:31:55.423
Jansenists against these kinds
of attacks, these are published

00:31:55.423 --> 00:31:57.339
by thousands of them.
 

00:31:57.339 --> 00:31:59.400
They can't be censored.
 

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.358
They begin to suggest at a time
in the eighteenth century,

00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:06.865
particularly after mid-century
when we can already begin to

00:32:06.865 --> 00:32:11.028
speak of French nationalism,
at least among the elite at the

00:32:11.028 --> 00:32:14.130
time of the Seven Years' War,
1756-1763,

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.410
thus the Seven Years' War.
 

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.348
It begins to suggest two things.
 

00:32:19.348 --> 00:32:22.390
That monarchies can behave
despotically,

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:28.619
going beyond the accepted
limits of absolute rule,

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:34.672
and that the nation,
this idea of the nation is

00:32:34.672 --> 00:32:38.150
being betrayed by bad
governments.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.852
If this doesn't sound like the
French Revolution,

00:32:40.852 --> 00:32:42.259
then nothing else will.
 

00:32:42.259 --> 00:32:44.910
Those are very important
defining moments.

00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:49.854
The same things happen also in
the 1760s and 1770s,

00:32:49.854 --> 00:32:55.095
with various attempts to
liberalize the French economy

00:32:55.095 --> 00:32:58.259
that I describe in the book.
 

00:32:58.259 --> 00:33:01.481
The king's attempt to dispense
with the parlements,

00:33:01.481 --> 00:33:05.220
which were really noble law
courts that were provincial.

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:06.319
You can read about this.
 

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:08.410
But the same thing happens.
 

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.618
This is the point.
 

00:33:10.618 --> 00:33:17.077
These lawyers begin turning out
these legal briefs that imply

00:33:17.077 --> 00:33:21.922
the same two things:
that absolute monarchy is

00:33:21.922 --> 00:33:28.488
risking stepping over the lines
of the acceptable and behaving

00:33:28.488 --> 00:33:32.928
in a despotic way,
and that there is something

00:33:32.928 --> 00:33:36.617
called the nation in which
nobody would have imagined that

00:33:36.617 --> 00:33:40.048
classes were all equal--the
discourse of liberty,

00:33:40.048 --> 00:33:45.826
fraternity and equality is a
hell of a long way away--;but

00:33:45.826 --> 00:33:52.107
that the traditional rights of
the nation are being betrayed by

00:33:52.107 --> 00:33:58.288
the monarchy and that things
isn't so good at Versailles.

00:33:58.288 --> 00:34:02.698
Again, trying to look ahead and
see what happens in 1788 and

00:34:02.698 --> 00:34:05.071
above all,
1789, which is one--I'm not a

00:34:05.071 --> 00:34:07.923
big guy on dates in history and
having to remember all these

00:34:07.923 --> 00:34:08.360
dates.
 

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:13.710
But 1789, like 1917,
that's a big one.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.768
That's a big one.
 

00:34:15.768 --> 00:34:19.920
But in order to also understand
the emergence of a radical

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.980
republic and the execution of
the king,

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:30.675
one has to see that the nation
becomes invested with a sense of

00:34:30.675 --> 00:34:38.125
moral quality that makes it not
impossible to imagine a world

00:34:38.125 --> 00:34:40.360
without kings.
 

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:45.255
And, so, lawyers,
who are called barristers,

00:34:45.255 --> 00:34:49.239
play a major role in all of
this.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:53.469
Again, this has to be seen in
the context of a century in

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:56.340
which more and more people can
read.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.769
The literacy rate in a country
like France is still well below

00:34:59.769 --> 00:35:01.963
fifty percent,
maybe forty or forty-five

00:35:01.963 --> 00:35:03.820
percent, something like that.
 

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:06.070
More men could read than women.
 

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:13.010
Not only literacy increases
among the elite,

00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:17.909
but the amount of things that
are published and the amount of

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:22.239
newspapers that are published
expands dramatically.

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:27.242
A point of reference would be
in Britain, you can read about

00:35:27.242 --> 00:35:31.568
this, the campaign of John
Wilkes, who was sort of a

00:35:31.568 --> 00:35:33.518
rascally character.
 

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:37.880
But Wilkes--and the number
forty-five becomes virtually

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.050
illegal,
because forty-five was the

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.878
number of a newspaper in which
Wilkes and his supporters

00:35:45.878 --> 00:35:50.530
essentially call out the British
political system.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.449
Again, we're talking mostly
about Western Europe,

00:35:52.449 --> 00:35:57.077
and literacy is much higher in
the Netherlands and in Northern

00:35:57.077 --> 00:36:02.159
France and in Northern Italy and
in England than in other places.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:05.309
This is part of this cultural
revolution.

00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:07.550
It's important to see the role
of this,

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.445
because in orthodox Marxist
interpretation you had to have

00:36:10.445 --> 00:36:13.177
the ever-rising bourgeoisie,
the rising in the fourteenth

00:36:13.177 --> 00:36:13.550
century.
 

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.320
There they are again in the
sixteenth century.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.492
They're like some sort of
runaway bread or something like

00:36:18.492 --> 00:36:18.889
that.
 

00:36:18.889 --> 00:36:21.260
In the nineteenth century there
they are, the bourgeois century.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.086
I'll give a lecture on the
bourgeoisie, because they do

00:36:24.086 --> 00:36:24.820
indeed rise.
 

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.594
Nonetheless,
a kind of class analysis can't

00:36:27.594 --> 00:36:29.380
be completely thrown out.
 

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.365
Classes did exist and people
had a sense of themselves as

00:36:32.365 --> 00:36:34.179
being members of a social class.
 

00:36:34.179 --> 00:36:38.215
It was not immutable--these
boundaries were more fluid in

00:36:38.215 --> 00:36:42.250
Britain than in other places,
but still are important.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:43.809
But now for the last thirty
years,

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:48.251
people have paid more attention
to the cultural concomitance of

00:36:48.251 --> 00:36:52.480
revolution and what difference
Enlightenment ideas made,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.295
and what difference the
emergence of a sense of the

00:36:56.295 --> 00:37:00.568
nation and the infusion of
politics with a sense of right

00:37:00.568 --> 00:37:02.630
and wrong and morality.
 

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.190
It's an important part of all
this.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:12.163
In the last twelve minutes and
thirty seconds that I have

00:37:12.163 --> 00:37:17.389
today, let me give you another
example of this.

00:37:17.389 --> 00:37:22.333
I think this is a
fascinating--it's so fascinating

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:24.150
I can't find it.
 

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.449
Let me give you an example.
 

00:37:26.449 --> 00:37:29.099
This is drawing upon an
excellent book by Sarah Maza.

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:33.536
It's a very well-known episode,
but it shows you and ties

00:37:33.536 --> 00:37:38.605
together the sense of the nation
along with the impact of this

00:37:38.605 --> 00:37:43.840
sort of third generation of
Enlightenment hacks after 1778,

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:49.259
to understand their role in the
erosion of a sense that the

00:37:49.259 --> 00:37:54.398
monarchy was immutable in
representing the rights of the

00:37:54.398 --> 00:37:58.601
nation,
even if that construct was just

00:37:58.601 --> 00:38:00.489
coming into being.
 

00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:06.150
In this book called--;what's it
called?--;Private Lives and

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.099
Public Affairs.
 

00:38:08.099 --> 00:38:11.489
Maza takes a couple of cause
célèbres.

00:38:11.489 --> 00:38:13.945
Cause célèbre
would be like one of the

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:16.530
things that you find in the
tabloids in Britain or the U.S.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:21.445
I don't read that stuff,
so I really can't give any good

00:38:21.445 --> 00:38:22.429
examples.
 

00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:25.552
But one of these actors and
actresses you always see running

00:38:25.552 --> 00:38:28.199
around, or whoever this person
is, Brittany Spears,

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:29.630
or something like that.
 

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:30.980
A singer or actress,
I don't know what she does.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:35.976
But anyway, something like
that, that people focus their

00:38:35.976 --> 00:38:38.518
attention on these people.
 

00:38:38.518 --> 00:38:42.097
They sort of dominate,
if you will--this is almost an

00:38:42.097 --> 00:38:45.333
insane comparison,
but the public sphere in that

00:38:45.333 --> 00:38:47.880
they're in the news all the
time.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:51.500
And, so,
what Maza did about the same

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.489
time that David Bell was working
on the role of lawyers in the

00:38:55.489 --> 00:38:59.869
eighteenth century is that she
took a couple of these examples,

00:38:59.869 --> 00:39:05.744
and shows the way in which
private affairs that were kind

00:39:05.744 --> 00:39:12.143
of sleazy and not too cool--but
were sensational--helped bring

00:39:12.143 --> 00:39:18.228
these threads together and
contributed to kind of erode the

00:39:18.228 --> 00:39:21.480
prestige of the monarchy.
 

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:28.007
This fits into the sense that
I've already given you that was

00:39:28.007 --> 00:39:31.893
extremely pervasive,
particularly around Paris is

00:39:31.893 --> 00:39:34.713
that a lot of things that went
on at Versailles weren't so

00:39:34.713 --> 00:39:35.110
good.
 

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:40.210
The 10,000 nobles who were
clustered around Louis XVI and

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:45.222
particularly his wife were
undermining the authority and

00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:51.920
the prestige of the monarchy,
and that wasn't a good thing.

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:55.420
An incident called "The
Diamond Necklace Affair"

00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.920
is illustrative and mildly
amusing, not more than that.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:06.539
It also involves this Palais
Royal place in Paris before.

00:40:06.539 --> 00:40:11.135
A woman called Jeanne de
Saint-Rémy--the name

00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:14.920
doesn't matter at all--was a
poor noble.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.869
She claimed descent from the
royal family.

00:40:17.869 --> 00:40:19.719
She had a pretty good education.
 

00:40:19.719 --> 00:40:21.929
She had important protectors.
 

00:40:21.929 --> 00:40:26.429
She marries an officer of
rather dubious noble title,

00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:29.286
who was called,
quite forgettably,

00:40:29.286 --> 00:40:31.710
the Marquis de la Motte.
 

00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:36.052
He met the fifty-year-old
cardinal called Louis de Rohan,

00:40:36.052 --> 00:40:40.010
whose name I should have put on
there, R-O-H-A-N.

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.480
He was from a very famous old
family called Rohan Soubise.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.967
The national archives used to
be and now they're adjacent to

00:40:47.967 --> 00:40:51.514
it in this fabulous old--why
don't they ever have things that

00:40:51.514 --> 00:40:52.519
work in here?
 

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:54.760
It's just unbelievable.
 

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:56.949
I can't find anything to write
with.

00:40:56.949 --> 00:41:02.400
The family called Rohan
Soubise--there's this wonderful,

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:07.949
wonderful palace or chateau in
the Marais, which is still

00:41:07.949 --> 00:41:08.940
there.
 

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:12.219
This cardinal is on the make.
 

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:13.179
He's very, very wealthy.
 

00:41:13.179 --> 00:41:13.820
He's a cardinal.
 

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.768
That's why he's wealthy.
 

00:41:14.768 --> 00:41:17.659
Or he's wealthy because he's a
cardinal.

00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:21.079
He thinks he's snubbed the
queen.

00:41:21.079 --> 00:41:25.550
He wants to be one of the
people who helped make important

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:28.838
decisions,
but he thinks he's alienated

00:41:28.838 --> 00:41:31.931
the queen,
that this is standing between

00:41:31.931 --> 00:41:35.518
him and the power that he thinks
he should have.

00:41:35.518 --> 00:41:44.380
He writes missives to the queen
begging her to forgive him.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.969
He's met this guy, de la Motte.
 

00:41:46.969 --> 00:41:50.878
They begin sending forged
replies from the queen that

00:41:50.878 --> 00:41:55.088
suggest that the queen now is
listening, and maybe all is

00:41:55.088 --> 00:41:58.019
forgiven and it's going to be
okay.

00:41:58.019 --> 00:42:00.610
They have this idea.
 

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:05.632
There's a famous jewel that had
647 flawless gems,

00:42:05.632 --> 00:42:11.168
worth 1.5 million pounds,
which is a whole lot of money

00:42:11.168 --> 00:42:14.449
in those days and still now.
 

00:42:14.449 --> 00:42:18.684
Louis XV had commissioned it
for one of his mistresses and

00:42:18.684 --> 00:42:22.250
then backed down because it was
too expensive.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:26.284
In 1788 the necklace was
offered to Louis XVI for Marie

00:42:26.284 --> 00:42:28.820
Antoinette,
but he turned it down,

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:33.889
saying the realm needs more
ships than it does more jewels,

00:42:33.889 --> 00:42:38.010
which was reasonable enough.
 

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:43.576
They con this old,
fairly horny cardinal into

00:42:43.576 --> 00:42:50.190
showing up at dusk at the Palais
Royal and introducing him to the

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.880
queen herself,
whom I guess he'd met once.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.469
But it's dusk and his eyesight
isn't that good.

00:42:56.469 --> 00:43:00.641
What they do is they find this
prostitute, of which there were

00:43:00.641 --> 00:43:04.744
about 25,000 in Paris at any one
time, who looks vaguely like

00:43:04.744 --> 00:43:06.179
Marie Antoinette.
 

00:43:06.179 --> 00:43:11.163
This cardinal,
de Rohan, thinks that his ship

00:43:11.163 --> 00:43:16.940
has come in, that everything is
going to be okay.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.307
This purchase order has been
forged, supposedly signed by the

00:43:21.307 --> 00:43:24.440
queen, and the real jewels are
delivered.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:28.199
Then, of course,
it's broken up into pieces and

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:33.021
sold on the street for zillions
of francs, sold on the black

00:43:33.021 --> 00:43:35.800
market in London and in Paris.
 

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.237
But there's a problem here,
because the word gets out what

00:43:38.237 --> 00:43:38.880
has happened.
 

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:41.005
And de Rohan,
who has really been made a

00:43:41.005 --> 00:43:42.860
fool, there's no doubt about it.
 

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.809
But it's more serious than
that,

00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:48.650
because that he has done is he
could be accused of

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:51.550
lèse
majesté,

00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:54.260
which is the ultimate kind of
insult,

00:43:54.260 --> 00:44:00.402
plotting against the queen by
identifying her prostitute as

00:44:00.402 --> 00:44:02.518
the queen herself.
 

00:44:02.518 --> 00:44:07.070
To make a very long story
short, the monarchy,

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:11.534
humiliated by all of this--the
cardinal is saying mass in his

00:44:11.534 --> 00:44:15.177
fancy robes in some cathedral,
probably Saint-Eustache,

00:44:15.177 --> 00:44:16.070
but I'm not sure.
 

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:17.623
It might have been Notre-Dame.
 

00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:18.349
I don't know.
 

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:19.719
Well, Saint-Eustache isn't a
cathedral.

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:22.650
But anyway, he's in his robes.
 

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.659
The police come in and arrest
him.

00:44:25.659 --> 00:44:30.050
What happens then is they put
him on trial.

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:37.224
He is not a terribly loveable
guy or--not someone to be very

00:44:37.224 --> 00:44:39.050
much admired.
 

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.949
By an incredible series--or not
an incredible series,

00:44:42.949 --> 00:44:47.800
but an almost logical playing
out of what I've been saying,

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:52.666
the lawyers who defend him and
the crowds who salute him

00:44:52.666 --> 00:44:57.974
portray him as a victim of a
regime that is crossing the line

00:44:57.974 --> 00:45:01.250
between absolutism and
despotism.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.849
He is a cardinal and he becomes
the darling of the people.

00:45:04.849 --> 00:45:08.385
Poor old Jeanne,
this noble, she and her

00:45:08.385 --> 00:45:12.829
boyfriend get branded and sent
off to the galleys,

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:16.909
et cetera, et cetera,
predictably enough.

00:45:16.909 --> 00:45:22.369
But the parlement of
Paris acquits the good cardinal,

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:26.480
and he emerges from the palace
of justice or the parement

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.710
--still now on the Ile
de-la-Cité,

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.280
the largest of the then three
but now two islands in the Seine

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:39.047
in Paris--to popular acclaim,
saying that justice and the

00:45:39.047 --> 00:45:44.219
interests of the nation have
been served by his acquittal.

00:45:44.219 --> 00:45:49.760
What this sleazy,
unsavory incident does is it

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.548
helps continue the
desacralization of the French

00:45:55.548 --> 00:45:57.150
monarchy.
 

00:45:57.150 --> 00:46:00.806
Again, lawyers and the people
who see themselves as

00:46:00.806 --> 00:46:04.829
representing the interests of
the French nation are,

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:08.039
in their own imaginary,
and in their own mental

00:46:08.039 --> 00:46:11.369
construction,
and in the eyes of people who

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:16.440
follow these events in legal
briefs and in newspapers--the

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.954
guy who's acquitted is seen as
somebody who had been done wrong

00:46:21.954 --> 00:46:25.869
to by a monarchy that has gone
too far.

00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:29.012
That exactly,
not much more than a year

00:46:29.012 --> 00:46:33.889
later, is what is going to play
out in the French Revolution

00:46:33.889 --> 00:46:34.800
itself.
 

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:37.090
To conclude,
Voltaire, de Rohan,

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.972
Montesquieu,
who you've been reading and

00:46:39.972 --> 00:46:44.626
these folks have big-time impact
on the way we look at the world

00:46:44.626 --> 00:46:45.809
around us.
 

00:46:45.809 --> 00:46:50.251
They had an impact on those
people who would become the

00:46:50.251 --> 00:46:53.789
organizers of the revolution and
indeed,

00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:57.280
the leaders of France and their
children,

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.289
their successors in the
nineteenth century.

00:47:00.289 --> 00:47:04.170
But lawyers,
part of this culture of

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:09.797
increased public sphere that was
Western Europe in particular but

00:47:09.797 --> 00:47:13.489
also parts of the rest of
Europe, too,

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:18.869
in the eighteenth century,
had a role in all of this,

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:22.666
and that by 1789,
not in any kind of inevitable

00:47:22.666 --> 00:47:24.186
process,
a revolution was not

00:47:24.186 --> 00:47:26.777
inevitable,
but the sense that the monarchy

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:30.572
had gone too far and that there
was something called the nation

00:47:30.572 --> 00:47:34.606
out there,
was in the public sphere and

00:47:34.606 --> 00:47:41.190
the results of all of this would
be there to see in 1789.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:45.472
Now, have a good weekend and on
Monday you're going to hear the

00:47:45.472 --> 00:47:48.994
execution of the king,
the death of Citizen Marat in

00:47:48.994 --> 00:47:50.099
his bathtub.
 

00:47:50.099 --> 00:47:53.322
I hope to make clear why some
people supported the revolution

00:47:53.322 --> 00:47:55.686
and others didn't,
and what difference it all

00:47:55.686 --> 00:47:56.170
made.
 

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.179
Have a great weekend.
 

00:47:57.179 --> 00:47:57.449
See ya!

00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:02.210
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.628
So today we start a sequence
which takes us through

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:10.516
deconstruction,
and it's a sequence which has

00:00:10.516 --> 00:00:12.460
genuine coherence.
 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.052
That is to say,
these are figures all of whom

00:00:16.052 --> 00:00:19.400
are attentive to each other's
thought,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.242
draw on each other,
and build from the materials

00:00:25.242 --> 00:00:32.080
that we're going to start
covering toward a certain--

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.313
not a certain end,
but toward a moment in which

00:00:35.313 --> 00:00:39.250
the materials of the tradition
seem to be undermined,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.609
actually, in deconstruction,
but in which they are still

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.780
prominent and set the terms of
debate.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.081
The relationship between the
Russian formalists and the work

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:57.460
of the linguist Ferdinand de
Saussure,

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.009
which we'll be taking up on
Thursday,

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:01.469
is a complex one.
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.251
I'm going to say certain things
about it, and you may find

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:08.769
yourselves discussing this
relationship in section.

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:13.155
I think much will come clear
when we actually get into what's

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:17.760
called "structuralism"
and you read the essay by Roman

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.391
Jakobson called
"Linguistics and

00:01:20.391 --> 00:01:23.680
Poetics,"
Jakobson having spent the early

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.360
part of his career as a
card-carrying member of OPOJAZ,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.640
the journal of the Russian
formalists;

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.156
and then who,
owing to various forces that

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:37.102
I'll be talking about,
emigrated first to Prague,

00:01:37.102 --> 00:01:40.780
Czechoslovakia where he joined
a linguistic circle,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.705
which in a variety of ways
proved to be the origin of

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.970
what's called structuralism.
 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.043
Then, of course,
he moved on to Paris where he

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.253
knew Claude Levi-Strauss and
influenced him and,

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:55.780
ultimately, to the United
States.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.473
The essay, "Linguistics
and Poetics,"

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:00.640
which you'll be reading next
week,

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.575
I think will give you perhaps a
clearer sense of the way in

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:05.500
which the Russian formalists'
work,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.919
and the work of Saussure--the
foundational work of Saussure--

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:14.448
in the General Course in
Linguistics amalgamates in

00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:18.897
ways that are profoundly
fruitful and influential for the

00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:21.837
subsequent course of
structuralist and

00:02:21.837 --> 00:02:24.460
deconstructionist thinking.
 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.090
So today we begin thinking
about the Russian formalists,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.508
but I also do want to think of
them as kicking off a tradition

00:02:33.508 --> 00:02:35.622
which,
just in order to place

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:39.482
them--vis-Ã -vis what
you've been reading and hearing

00:02:39.482 --> 00:02:43.538
about already,
one can say something like this

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:48.060
about this tradition:
it differs markedly from,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.420
and it's opposed to,
hermeneutics in this one

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.710
particular.
 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.655
It's one that is maybe
initially counterintuitive but

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:01.145
actually, I think,
is rather important once you

00:03:01.145 --> 00:03:03.270
begin to think about it.
 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.169
Hermeneutics is,
well, more or less by nature

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.979
and by definition,
interested in meaning.

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.421
That is to say,
the arts of interpretation are

00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:18.018
used for the purpose of
discovering, uncovering,

00:03:18.018 --> 00:03:20.158
and arriving at meaning.
 

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:23.240
Very frequently,
as is the case in Gadamer,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.979
this meaning is called
"the subject matter":

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:28.757
that is to say,
what--in thinking about

00:03:28.757 --> 00:03:32.128
literature in terms of form and
content,

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.150
let's say--we'd call
"content."

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.180
So in any case,
hermeneutics is devoted to the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.836
discovery of meaning,
and the art that it's concerned

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.240
with is the art of
interpretation.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.315
Well, the Russian formalists
differed very sharply in this

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:54.389
regard because what they're
interested in is precisely the

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.035
way in which
"literariness,"

00:03:57.035 --> 00:04:00.330
as they call it--
the devices of

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.990
literariness--can be deployed so
as to impede,

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.800
to interfere with,
and to hinder our arrival at

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.628
meaning.
 

00:04:10.628 --> 00:04:14.284
If, in other words,
hermeneutics is devoted to the

00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:18.240
possibility of communication and
of understanding,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.819
the Russian formalists are
interested in that special

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.086
aspect of verbal communication
called "literariness,"

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.733
which actually interferes with
these very processes of

00:04:29.733 --> 00:04:32.350
communication and understanding.
 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.476
The roughening of the
surface--celebrated by Shklovsky

00:04:36.476 --> 00:04:40.060
as a form of
"defamiliarization"--

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.327
is what slows us down,
what gets in the way of our

00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:51.192
arriving at meaning,
and does so for a variety of

00:04:51.192 --> 00:04:54.899
reasons that the formalists are
engaged to attend to.

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:59.310
Now you may take note of the
fact that what I'm saying isn't

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.163
completely convincing,
perhaps, to those who have been

00:05:03.163 --> 00:05:06.812
reading the New Critics and
Wolfgang Iser and have noticed

00:05:06.812 --> 00:05:10.834
that they,
too, are very interested in the

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:16.985
ways in which literariness does
involve special techniques and

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:19.910
devices that slow us down.
 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.038
In other words,
replacing the shortest distance

00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:26.504
between two points that we
experience in a practical

00:05:26.504 --> 00:05:28.653
message,
"literariness,"

00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:31.810
as the formalists call it,
or "poetic language,"

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.295
as they also sometimes call it
and as the New Critics certainly

00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:36.990
call it,
slows us down.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.742
It creates as a distance
between two points,

00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:43.009
rather than a straight
line, an arabesque.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.565
In other words,
it makes us pause over what

00:05:46.565 --> 00:05:47.920
we're reading.
 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.355
It gets in the way of arriving
too quickly at meaning,

00:05:52.355 --> 00:05:55.870
if indeed one arrives at
meaning at all.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.293
The formalists are uniquely
concerned, however,

00:05:59.293 --> 00:06:02.343
with the way in which
literature is put

00:06:02.343 --> 00:06:03.610
together.
 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.949
Those titles that Eikhenbaum
keeps talking about--

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.470
How Don Quixote
was Made,

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.850
How Gogol's Overcoat
was Made--

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.656
reflect the preoccupation of
the Russian formalists with how

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.019
literature is put together.
 

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:21.023
In other words,
whereas the New Critics and

00:06:21.023 --> 00:06:25.170
Wolfgang Iser are interested in
the roughening of form,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.560
they're interested in it for
hermeneutic purposes.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.471
It slows us down,
yes, but this slowing down is a

00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:37.117
means of enriching what we
finally grasp to be the meaning

00:06:37.117 --> 00:06:38.259
of a text.
 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:42.572
So they are still engaged in
the hermeneutic enterprise in

00:06:42.572 --> 00:06:43.860
interpretation.
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.187
The formalists are really
relatively indifferent to

00:06:47.187 --> 00:06:51.050
questions of meaning and to
questions of interpretation.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.550
They're interested in what they
call "science."

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.879
They're interested in structure.
 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:59.259
They're interested,
in other words,

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:01.778
in the way a text is put
together.

00:07:01.778 --> 00:07:04.752
That is, I think,
essentially the difference

00:07:04.752 --> 00:07:08.209
between what we have been
talking about so far,

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:11.389
even though there have been a
variety of outlooks,

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.050
and what we are talking about
now.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.084
Temporarily,
as we advance through the

00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:21.593
syllabus, we're bracketing or
suspending our interest in

00:07:21.593 --> 00:07:26.350
meaning and focusing instead on
how something is made.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.170
Take, for example,
Tony the Tow Truck.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:39.350
I mentioned that an interesting
phenomenon in Tony,

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.187
the text of Tony,
is the tripartition of the

00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:45.817
"t"
sound: "Tony,"

00:07:45.817 --> 00:07:48.589
"tow,"
"truck."

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:54.963
Just after we read in the text,
"Tony the Tow Truck,"

00:07:54.963 --> 00:08:00.720
we encounter a triadic or
triple encounter with vehicles:

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.290
Neato, Speedy,
Bumpy.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.459
In other words,
there's a three-ness which

00:08:06.459 --> 00:08:11.098
appears at a variety of levels
in the text of Tony the Tow

00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:15.194
Truck which exactly
corresponds to the aphorism of

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:18.519
Osip Brik quoted by Eikhenbaum
in your text:

00:08:18.519 --> 00:08:22.617
"repetition in verse is
analogous to tautology in

00:08:22.617 --> 00:08:24.550
folklore."
 

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:28.800
Now we have uncovered something
about the form,

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.470
the structure,
of Tony the Tow Truck in

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.931
saying this,
but we haven't discovered or

00:08:33.931 --> 00:08:36.904
uncovered a thing about the
meaning of Tony the Tow

00:08:36.904 --> 00:08:37.408
Truck.
 

00:08:37.408 --> 00:08:40.719
Nothing follows from this
really--I think--rather

00:08:40.719 --> 00:08:44.474
interesting observation that
there's a kind of pervasiveness

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:45.620
of triadicity.
 

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.731
Nothing follows from this
observation about the actual

00:08:49.731 --> 00:08:51.440
meaning of the text.
 

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.234
Now if you're clever enough
maybe you could

00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:54.174
&gt;
 

00:08:54.174 --> 00:08:56.440
parlay it into a sense of the
meaning of the text.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.070
Who knows?
 

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.149
Maybe we'll try on some other
occasion,

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:04.461
but for the moment I think you
can see that in making remarks

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:09.686
of this kind about a text one
has shifted the attention from

00:09:09.686 --> 00:09:11.899
meaning to structure.
 

00:09:11.899 --> 00:09:17.248
It's in that context that most
of the observations we encounter

00:09:17.248 --> 00:09:21.129
in Russian formalism need to be
understood.

00:09:21.129 --> 00:09:24.960
Now the stress on taxonomy--in
other words,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.000
the stress on the relationship
among parts,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.216
the understanding of the
various parts of the literary

00:09:33.216 --> 00:09:38.038
texts as "devices,"
which is to say,

00:09:38.038 --> 00:09:42.221
interrelated one with the
others--this emphasis on

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:47.511
taxonomy is one of the ways in
which the formalists insist that

00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:50.668
what they're doing is
scientific.

00:09:50.668 --> 00:09:55.370
Nobody can possibly miss in
reading Eikhenbaum's

00:09:55.370 --> 00:10:00.470
rhetorically rather bizarre
essay his obsession with

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.759
struggle,
with the fight,

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:06.658
and with doing battle.
 

00:10:06.658 --> 00:10:09.027
You go on and say to yourself,
"Good heavens.

00:10:09.027 --> 00:10:10.668
It's just talk about
literature.

00:10:10.668 --> 00:10:11.481
&gt;
 

00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:11.702
Relax.
 

00:10:11.702 --> 00:10:12.590
&gt;
 

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.428
It can't be that
important."

00:10:15.428 --> 00:10:18.894
But for Eikhenbaum,
there's obviously a lot at

00:10:18.894 --> 00:10:19.509
stake.
 

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:23.434
I'll try to give you some
social and historical reasons

00:10:23.434 --> 00:10:27.070
why this is the case,
but in the meantime what he's

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.133
struggling for is
important to recognize,

00:10:30.133 --> 00:10:30.590
too.
 

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.658
In the very first sentence of
the essay,

00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:36.106
you read the expression
"the struggle for

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:39.711
science"--
an interesting formulation,

00:10:39.711 --> 00:10:42.950
"the struggle for
science."

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.614
Now obviously,
the struggle takes place

00:10:45.614 --> 00:10:49.188
against the backdrop of
completely undisciplined and

00:10:49.188 --> 00:10:53.044
unsystematic thinking which
Eikhenbaum identifies as the

00:10:53.044 --> 00:10:56.129
typical thinking of the
universities,

00:10:56.129 --> 00:10:57.370
of the academy.
 

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.293
It's a pretty state of affairs,
in his view,

00:11:00.293 --> 00:11:03.966
when the most rigorous thinking
that's being done about

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:07.298
literature is being done in
popular journals.

00:11:07.298 --> 00:11:10.460
That's part of the struggle,
undoubtedly,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:16.432
but another part of the
struggle is simply to reach some

00:11:16.432 --> 00:11:19.238
means,
to break through to some means

00:11:19.238 --> 00:11:22.528
of understanding the thing that
you're talking about.

00:11:22.528 --> 00:11:25.024
You want to talk about it
systematically,

00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:28.518
but how can you talk about
anything systematically if you

00:11:28.518 --> 00:11:30.139
don't know what it is?
 

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:34.759
You need to pin down an object
of study,

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:39.308
a first principle from which
other principles can emerge,

00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:42.538
and part of the process is to
say, "Hey,

00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:44.580
it's not literature we're
talking about.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.970
Who knows what literature is?
 

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.980
Nobody's really ever known what
literature is."

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.899
What we're talking about is
literariness--

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.615
that is to say,
certain devices that we can

00:11:54.615 --> 00:11:58.509
identify that perform a certain
function--

00:11:58.509 --> 00:12:01.580
and maybe out of the
identification of these devices,

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:06.620
to evolve a theory that's more
widespread.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.294
Now I use the word
"evolve"

00:12:09.294 --> 00:12:10.408
deliberately.
 

00:12:10.408 --> 00:12:12.898
In the backdrop,
in the background,

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:15.605
of that expression,
"struggle for

00:12:15.605 --> 00:12:18.899
science,"
there are two key figures.

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:24.125
The first is obviously Marx
against the backdrop of the

00:12:24.125 --> 00:12:30.318
first great Socialist Revolution
which eventually resulted in the

00:12:30.318 --> 00:12:34.942
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917,
when the Russian formalist

00:12:34.942 --> 00:12:36.379
movement was at its height.
 

00:12:36.379 --> 00:12:41.385
Against the backdrop of Marx's
thought pervading not just

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:46.750
Russian life but beginning to
pervade Russian government--

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.379
against this backdrop,
the idea of struggle,

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:54.788
as in class struggle,
is going to predominate.

00:12:54.788 --> 00:13:01.090
Eikhenbaum in this culture will
be using such a word advisedly,

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.504
almost familiarly,
but at the same time it's very

00:13:04.504 --> 00:13:08.630
interesting that the kind of
science he's thinking about is

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.408
not just any science.
 

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:13.548
You'll see this more and more
clearly as you read through the

00:13:13.548 --> 00:13:15.168
text and as we talk about it.
 

00:13:15.168 --> 00:13:20.120
It's Darwinian science and it's
very interesting that Darwin,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.177
as much as Marx,
is all about struggle:

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:27.820
the struggle for survival,
the struggle for dominance.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.000
Notice the importance--and
we'll come back to it--

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.095
of the word
"dominant":

00:13:33.095 --> 00:13:36.629
"the dominant"
in the thinking of the Russian

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:40.493
formalists and the struggle for
dominance among species in a

00:13:40.493 --> 00:13:41.408
habitat.
 

00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:44.759
So in literature you have
something like--

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:48.910
if you think in terms of
literary evolution as Jurij

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.469
Tynjanov does in the essay that
the passage on your sheet

00:13:53.469 --> 00:13:57.238
concludes--
if you think in those terms,

00:13:57.238 --> 00:14:02.245
you think about literary
history itself as a sequence of

00:14:02.245 --> 00:14:07.341
changes in which devices and
aspects of the literary text

00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:13.350
struggle for dominance within
and over against other devices.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:19.244
So it is simultaneously in his
very first sentence a Marxist

00:14:19.244 --> 00:14:25.038
and a Darwinian vocabulary that
Eikhenbaum is invoking,

00:14:25.038 --> 00:14:28.706
and that's what partly accounts
for the strenuousness of his

00:14:28.706 --> 00:14:29.389
rhetoric.
 

00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:33.908
There is the backdrop of class
struggle which is understood as

00:14:33.908 --> 00:14:34.649
crucial.
 

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:38.306
There is the fermentation of
Darwinian thought,

00:14:38.306 --> 00:14:42.279
which at the same time is
understood as crucial.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:47.279
A great deal is at stake,
and if those disorganized,

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:52.341
unsystematic academics aren't
attuned to the importance of

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.380
these struggles--
right, class struggle,

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:59.101
the struggle for science,
science as the science of

00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:03.500
struggle--
if they aren't attuned to these

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.909
currents,
these contemporary currents,

00:15:06.909 --> 00:15:10.941
that's just another way of
showing how irrelevant and

00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:12.570
obsolete they are.
 

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:17.269
Now "The Theory of the
Formal Method,"

00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:21.769
Eikhenbaum's essay that you've
read for today,

00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:24.168
was written in 1927.
 

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:27.895
In other words,
it was written directly in the

00:15:27.895 --> 00:15:32.533
aftermath of a bombshell
published by Leon Trotsky called

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:36.259
Literature and Revolution
in 1926.

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:40.801
Trotsky's Literature and
Revolution is a brilliant

00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:43.306
book,
an attack on many things and a

00:15:43.306 --> 00:15:47.312
defense of certain other things,
but in particular and very

00:15:47.312 --> 00:15:50.168
painfully an attack on the
formalists.

00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:55.475
Trotsky argues that the
preoccupation with form in and

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:59.480
for itself is a kind of
aestheticism--

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.072
something, by the way,
which Eikhenbaum denies during

00:16:02.072 --> 00:16:05.109
the course of his text--
a kind of aestheticism,

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:09.648
turning its back on history and
turning its back precisely on

00:16:09.648 --> 00:16:11.009
class struggle.
 

00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:14.015
Trotsky is not simple-minded in
his literary taste,

00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:17.143
and he doesn't just sort of
spontaneously insist that

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:19.850
everybody has to write socialist
realism.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.307
That doesn't,
by the way, happen until 1934

00:16:23.307 --> 00:16:27.668
when it became a kind of
pronouncement of necessity at

00:16:27.668 --> 00:16:33.019
the International Soviet Writers
Conference on that occasion.

00:16:33.019 --> 00:16:35.926
In the meantime,
Trotsky's book is a shot fired

00:16:35.926 --> 00:16:39.779
across the bow of those forms of
"aestheticism"--

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:44.220
quote, unquote--which can be
understood as self-involved,

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.030
self-preoccupied,
and indifferent to history and

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.409
class struggle.
 

00:16:49.409 --> 00:16:52.769
It's 1927.
 

00:16:52.769 --> 00:16:53.990
Things are changing.
 

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:57.220
It's been ten years since the
Revolution.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:06.020
There is a kind of taking hold
of society and government by

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:15.582
increasingly bureaucratized and
strict forms of surveillance and

00:17:15.582 --> 00:17:20.588
management of social matters.
 

00:17:20.588 --> 00:17:24.521
Whether and to what extent the
Russian formalists and their

00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:26.863
allies,
the Futurists--among them

00:17:26.863 --> 00:17:31.900
Mayakovsky and others--
felt a kind of antagonism or

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:38.413
growing threat from the
government is not wholly clear

00:17:38.413 --> 00:17:39.519
to me.
 

00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:45.509
It's been disputed and one
doesn't know for sure.

00:17:45.509 --> 00:17:50.457
There is still a tremendous
amount of intellectual ferment

00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:54.190
and excitement in the capitals
of Russia.

00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:57.978
This is not a wasteland of
thought by any means,

00:17:57.978 --> 00:18:02.571
and the Russian formalists are
an important part of what's

00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:03.618
going on.
 

00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:06.359
Nevertheless,
Trotsky's book is a

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:07.558
provocation.
 

00:18:07.558 --> 00:18:12.009
It's a challenge,
and Eikhenbaum's essay that you

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:16.336
read for today is in part--
to a degree that it can't

00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:19.726
really come out and talk about,
or doesn't want to come out and

00:18:19.726 --> 00:18:23.548
talk about it--
a response to Trotsky's book.

00:18:23.548 --> 00:18:28.202
So there were criticisms in the
air--but obviously he doesn't

00:18:28.202 --> 00:18:30.528
want to say much about that.
 

00:18:30.528 --> 00:18:32.478
There's one way in which he
does talk about it,

00:18:32.478 --> 00:18:32.858
though.
 

00:18:32.858 --> 00:18:38.214
That is the marvelous exchange
between the ethnographic critic

00:18:38.214 --> 00:18:43.220
Veselovsky and Shklovsky of
1917, which I'll return to;

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.890
but for the most part,
he stays away,

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:51.749
seems at least to stay away,
from the provocation and simply

00:18:51.749 --> 00:18:55.085
defends the right of the
formalists to exist and the

00:18:55.085 --> 00:18:57.440
integrity of what they're doing.
 

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.170
The obvious
"enemies"--

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:01.558
and of course,
this is Eikhenbaum's language,

00:19:01.558 --> 00:19:03.890
so one needn't wince away from
using it--

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.837
the obvious enemies,
in this case,

00:19:06.837 --> 00:19:10.858
are figures like Potebnya the
academician,

00:19:10.858 --> 00:19:15.690
who in a way defended the
premises of the Symbolists,

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.798
which was the other very lively
group of antagonists to the

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:23.195
formalists--
to the effect that poetry is

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:24.828
all about imagery.
 

00:19:24.828 --> 00:19:29.009
It's all about patterns of
thought.

00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:32.673
In the case of the Symbolists,
it's thought arising from the

00:19:32.673 --> 00:19:36.400
unconscious and being reinforced
by sound and by language;

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.490
so that language is subsidiary
to imagery and thought,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.509
a kind of handmaiden of it--the
vessel,

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:47.430
in other words,
into which the energies of

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.298
symbolic thought are poured.
 

00:19:50.298 --> 00:19:55.126
It's this basic antagonism,
this difference of opinion,

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:59.150
that Eikhenbaum wants to focus
on and, indeed,

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.759
does focus on.
 

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:06.450
At the same time,
there is a feeling,

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.036
somehow there is a feeling--and
it's very clear in an essay by

00:20:10.036 --> 00:20:13.269
Jakobson called "The
Generation that Squandered its

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:15.842
Poets"--
of something like

00:20:15.842 --> 00:20:19.450
bureaucratization that's taking
hold,

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:23.346
something like the an
atmosphere in which our

00:20:23.346 --> 00:20:28.220
perceptions of the things around
us become automated.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:34.494
Shklovsky in particular is very
much preoccupied with the sense

00:20:34.494 --> 00:20:38.240
of the automatization or
automism--

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.450
I much prefer the latter
word--of perception,

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.608
the way in which we no longer
really see what's around us.

00:20:45.608 --> 00:20:48.892
I quoted the other day Wallace
Stevens saying that poetry

00:20:48.892 --> 00:20:52.348
should "make the visible a
little hard to see."

00:20:52.348 --> 00:20:54.680
By the same token,
Shklovsky insists,

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.568
and his colleagues insist,
that the business of the

00:20:59.568 --> 00:21:05.631
roughening of surface by means
of various modes of literariness

00:21:05.631 --> 00:21:10.130
is to defamiliarize automated
perceptions;

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.156
to make us suddenly see again,
to see the nature of the

00:21:14.156 --> 00:21:17.201
language that we're using,
and, indeed,

00:21:17.201 --> 00:21:19.700
also to see--this is very
clear,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.169
by the way, in the essay
"Literature as

00:21:22.169 --> 00:21:24.409
Technique"
in your anthology that I

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:29.065
recommended that you read--
at the same to see the world

00:21:29.065 --> 00:21:35.329
itself anew by means of devices
of language that tear the film

00:21:35.329 --> 00:21:37.588
away from our eyes.
 

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:41.832
So defamiliarization,
against the backdrop of a kind

00:21:41.832 --> 00:21:46.573
of gray uniformity that Jakobson
in his essay on "The

00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:50.566
Generation that Squandered its
Poets" called

00:21:50.566 --> 00:21:54.054
"byt"--
I don't know how to pronounce

00:21:54.054 --> 00:21:54.380
that.
 

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.519
I don't know a word of Russian,
and so I actually try to avoid

00:21:57.519 --> 00:22:00.402
using the rather well-known
Russian equivalents for these

00:22:00.402 --> 00:22:02.410
terms because I feel like an
idiot.

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.818
Yes, I see them in the text
just as anybody else does,

00:22:06.818 --> 00:22:09.521
but since I don't really know
what they mean except by means

00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:11.660
of the translation,
why should I use them?

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:15.185
But in any case,
this is a well-known term used

00:22:15.185 --> 00:22:18.098
by Jakobson in this essay which
is,

00:22:18.098 --> 00:22:21.775
like all such terms that
somehow wander into other

00:22:21.775 --> 00:22:25.108
languages,
difficult to translate.

00:22:25.108 --> 00:22:26.848
That's why they wander into
other languages.

00:22:26.848 --> 00:22:32.315
It means something like a kind
of dulled grayness or

00:22:32.315 --> 00:22:34.779
ordinariness of life.
 

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:39.324
It's that backdrop--it's that
sense of bureaucratized

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:42.541
existence--
that defamiliarization has,

00:22:42.541 --> 00:22:46.761
to a certain extent,
the ideological purpose of

00:22:46.761 --> 00:22:49.480
dispelling and undermining.
 

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.880
One has to recognize,
in other words,

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.880
that this motive,
this motive force,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.009
stands behind the work of the
Russian formalists,

00:23:00.009 --> 00:23:05.353
so that the claim to be
strictly scientific needs to be

00:23:05.353 --> 00:23:10.500
hedged a little bit as a return
of the aesthetic,

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.670
or a return of value,
understood as the insistence

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:18.500
that life doesn't need to be all
that dull.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.522
That really is implicit
&gt;

00:23:21.522 --> 00:23:24.009
in the Russian formalist
viewpoint.

00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:25.769
Literariness, then.
 

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:27.720
What is literariness?
 

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.114
It is those aspects of a text,
the way in which those devices

00:23:32.114 --> 00:23:35.848
of a text that call themselves
to our attention,

00:23:35.848 --> 00:23:40.309
are new: that is to say,
the way in which they shake up

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:45.680
perception through the fact that
we're not used to seeing them.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:51.380
In a way, this call for that
which is new is worldwide;

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.933
at the same time you have Ezra
Pound among the high Modernists

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:57.440
in the West saying,
"Make it new,"

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.490
as his slogan.
 

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:02.836
You have the various
observations of Eliot and Joyce

00:24:02.836 --> 00:24:05.325
and others,
whom I cited last time in

00:24:05.325 --> 00:24:08.019
talking about the background to
the New Criticism--

00:24:08.019 --> 00:24:11.230
all of them insisting on the
necessity of difficulty,

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.386
of novelty, of coming to terms
with the immediacy of one's

00:24:15.386 --> 00:24:19.766
particular circumstances,
and of getting away from that

00:24:19.766 --> 00:24:23.150
which is familiar and ordinary
and vague.

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:26.861
It is a transnational idea,
in other words,

00:24:26.861 --> 00:24:31.278
which nevertheless has,
obviously, certain specific

00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:34.990
applications depending on where
it is.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:39.220
The newness that the Russian
formalists are interested in is

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.868
not just any newness.
 

00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:48.076
It has to do particularly with
the palpable or roughened form

00:24:48.076 --> 00:24:51.798
of that which defamiliarizes.
 

00:24:51.798 --> 00:24:54.348
Now how do we understand this
form?

00:24:54.348 --> 00:24:56.618
"Form"
as opposed to what?

00:24:56.618 --> 00:25:00.972
This is a crucial issue for the
Russian formalists,

00:25:00.972 --> 00:25:03.759
which they handle very boldly.
 

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:10.180
Part of their platform is that
everything is form.

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.412
There is no distinction,
in other words,

00:25:13.412 --> 00:25:15.650
between form and content.
 

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.493
That's the fundamental mistake,
as they see it,

00:25:19.493 --> 00:25:23.507
that their enemies of various
kinds make in their

00:25:23.507 --> 00:25:26.348
understanding,
in their approach to

00:25:26.348 --> 00:25:27.769
literature.
 

00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:30.272
But, you know,
the formalists' own basic

00:25:30.272 --> 00:25:32.779
distinctions are dualistic,
aren't they:

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:35.490
the distinction between poetic
and practical language,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.798
the distinction between plot
and story,

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:40.548
the distinction between rhythm
and meter?

00:25:40.548 --> 00:25:43.529
In all of these cases,
you're tempted to say,

00:25:43.529 --> 00:25:44.750
"Well, gee.
 

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.348
One of those must be form
&gt;

00:25:46.348 --> 00:25:49.000
and the other must be
content--in particular,

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.125
obviously "plot"
and "story"

00:25:51.125 --> 00:25:53.431
where "plot"
is the constructedness of the

00:25:53.431 --> 00:25:56.190
text and the "story"
is what the text is about.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.650
Doesn't that sound a lot like
form and content?"

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.972
Well, I actually think the
Russian formalists can be

00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:05.318
defended against the charge
that,

00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:09.570
unbeknownst to themselves,
they fall back in to

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:14.746
form-content distinctions by
insisting on this variety of

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:16.038
dualities.
 

00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:21.423
I want to spend a little time
suggesting and developing the

00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:25.880
way in which that defense could
be undertaken.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.230
Poetic and practical language:
you've already been hearing

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.970
this in I.A. Richards and in
the New Critics.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:38.390
While the New Critics,
in a variety of ways,

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.618
insist that form is meaning,
form is content and so on,

00:26:41.618 --> 00:26:44.998
they're still not really
breaking down the distinction

00:26:44.998 --> 00:26:46.720
between form and content.
 

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.824
There's an obvious sense in
which they understand poetic

00:26:50.824 --> 00:26:54.630
language to be that in which
form is predominant and

00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:59.630
practical language to be that in
which content is predominant,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.400
but the Russian formalists see
it in a slightly different way.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:10.480
Content is a function--or let
me say practical language,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.974
the purpose,
in other words,

00:27:11.974 --> 00:27:14.910
of communicating facts or of
communicating at all,

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:17.470
which we associate with
practical language--

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.038
is a function of poetic
language.

00:27:21.038 --> 00:27:23.971
That is to say,
it coexists with poetic

00:27:23.971 --> 00:27:24.818
language.
 

00:27:24.818 --> 00:27:28.795
It is an aspect of a text,
the way in which it does

00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:33.702
communicate in other words,
which has to be understood as

00:27:33.702 --> 00:27:38.130
existing in a dynamic,
functional relationship with

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:43.230
those aspects of the text in
which literariness is dominant.

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:46.330
It's not a question,
in other words,

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:51.471
of poetry or of a novel being
somehow or another strictly a

00:27:51.471 --> 00:27:54.130
matter of poetic language.
 

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:59.305
In poetry or the novel,
you can argue that the poetic

00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:02.440
function--
and this is the term Jakobson

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.250
will ultimately use for it in
his essay,

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.400
"Linguistics and
Poetics"--

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.308
that the poetic function is the
dominant;

00:28:10.308 --> 00:28:15.039
but that's not to say that
practical language is absent or

00:28:15.039 --> 00:28:18.359
that it doesn't have its own
function.

00:28:22.528 --> 00:28:25.843
By the way, if we begin by
talking about poetic and

00:28:25.843 --> 00:28:28.758
practical language,
we're beginning where the

00:28:28.758 --> 00:28:30.680
Russian formalists began.
 

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.134
As Eikhenbaum explains,
in 1914 the first publication

00:28:35.134 --> 00:28:40.019
of their journal was entirely
devoted to poetic sound,

00:28:40.019 --> 00:28:45.990
to the way in which sound
seems, indeed is,

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:51.318
not merely subservient to the
elaboration of sense.

00:28:51.318 --> 00:28:54.442
One of the things,
by the way, that Eikhenbaum

00:28:54.442 --> 00:28:58.469
does in passing is remind us
that we should be on our guard

00:28:58.469 --> 00:29:01.940
against thinking that sound is
onomatopoetic--

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:06.105
that is, that it reflects the
meaning of what it's talking

00:29:06.105 --> 00:29:06.690
about.
 

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.626
When I say "pigeon,"
I don't really seem to have any

00:29:11.626 --> 00:29:15.269
particular sense of an
onomatopoetic word,

00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:17.608
but if I use the Latin,
pipio,

00:29:17.608 --> 00:29:18.785
which means "to
chirp," all of a sudden I

00:29:18.785 --> 00:29:19.567
say,
"Oh, that's

00:29:19.567 --> 00:29:20.380
onomatopoetic."
 

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.519
Well, the formalists and also
Saussure--

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:26.461
this is one of the most
important links between the

00:29:26.461 --> 00:29:30.196
formalists and Saussure--
are very carefully on their

00:29:30.196 --> 00:29:33.140
guard against supposing that
sound,

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:37.509
that the ways in which we hear
language,

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.910
is onomatopoetic because that
would suggest once again,

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.271
in keeping with Symbolist
ideas, that sound was

00:29:44.271 --> 00:29:46.098
subservient to meaning.
 

00:29:46.098 --> 00:29:50.765
The importance of the earliest
work of the Russian formalists

00:29:50.765 --> 00:29:55.430
was the establishment of the
idea that sound goes its own way

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.538
and is not subservient to
anything,

00:29:58.538 --> 00:30:04.160
that it is a device independent
of,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.019
though interacting with,
other devices,

00:30:07.019 --> 00:30:11.743
and that it doesn't exist for
the purpose of elucidating

00:30:11.743 --> 00:30:12.690
anything.
 

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:16.637
In fact, it exists,
amazingly, in order to hinder

00:30:16.637 --> 00:30:21.326
understanding in the kinds of
texts that we're inclined to

00:30:21.326 --> 00:30:23.630
call "poetic."
 

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.359
It's repetitive;
it's anti-economical;

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:30.318
it's retardant.
 

00:30:30.318 --> 00:30:34.261
Language of this source is a
device, and in relation to other

00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:37.220
devices it's called a
"function."

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.430
We call it a function.
 

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:39.890
That is to say it has a
function;

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:44.596
it has a function within our
understanding of the way in

00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:47.078
which a text has structure.
 

00:30:47.078 --> 00:30:51.613
Every aspect of the structure
of the text can be understood as

00:30:51.613 --> 00:30:53.098
having a function.
 

00:30:53.098 --> 00:30:55.218
Take, for example,
"The rain in Spain falls

00:30:55.218 --> 00:30:56.480
mainly on the plain."
 

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.895
Now this is an example of a
text in which alliteration is

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:06.808
plainly predominant.
 

00:31:06.808 --> 00:31:10.943
It is repetitive,
and we understand it to be

00:31:10.943 --> 00:31:16.424
somehow different from the
ordinary way in which a fact is

00:31:16.424 --> 00:31:20.875
communicated;
but if we are not Russian

00:31:20.875 --> 00:31:23.229
formalists,
we're tempted to say,

00:31:23.229 --> 00:31:26.540
"Well,
it's a mnemotechnic device

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:31.034
introduced for the purpose of--
that is to say,

00:31:31.034 --> 00:31:33.960
it's subservient to--
the communication of a

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.680
fact."
 

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.150
By the way, I've never known
whether it is a fact.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:38.640
&gt;
 

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.771
A lot of mountains are rainy.
 

00:31:39.771 --> 00:31:40.670
&gt;
 

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.548
The Pyrenees I suppose are dry.
 

00:31:42.548 --> 00:31:44.219
I really have no idea whether
it's a fact, and it's not

00:31:44.219 --> 00:31:45.920
important in My Fair Lady
whether it's a fact.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:54.513
What's important in My Fair
Lady is to repeat the

00:31:54.513 --> 00:32:00.115
repetitiousness of verse--
[spoken with heavy emphasis on

00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:01.585
rhythm]
"The rain in Spain falls

00:32:01.585 --> 00:32:05.565
mainly on the plain"--
in terms of the tautology of

00:32:05.565 --> 00:32:06.548
the plot.
 

00:32:06.548 --> 00:32:11.960
Eliza Doolittle tries
repeatedly to say that but,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.480
just like Neato and Speedy
failing or being unwilling to

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:21.712
push Tony out of his problem,
so Eliza repeatedly says [with

00:32:21.712 --> 00:32:25.096
a cockney accent],
"The rain in Spain falls

00:32:25.096 --> 00:32:26.630
mainly on the plain."
 

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:31.439
That's not good enough,
and so the repetition in the

00:32:31.439 --> 00:32:36.910
plot reinforces the repetition
of the sound in question.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:43.058
Whether or not it's a fact is
completely immaterial to Eliza,

00:32:43.058 --> 00:32:46.130
it's completely immaterial to
Henry Higgins,

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.474
and it's completely immaterial
to the outcome of My Fair

00:32:50.474 --> 00:32:51.298
Lady.
 

00:32:51.298 --> 00:32:58.622
What's important in My Fair
Lady is the functionality of

00:32:58.622 --> 00:33:06.063
repetition in the transformation
of the principal character into

00:33:06.063 --> 00:33:08.190
a lady, right?
 

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:12.448
So in formalist terms,
that's the way we have to

00:33:12.448 --> 00:33:15.709
understand what,
if we weren't formalists,

00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:17.877
we would suppose,
as I say, to be a

00:33:17.877 --> 00:33:20.990
mnemotechnical device for the
purpose of communicating

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.339
something about the weather in
Spain.

00:33:23.339 --> 00:33:24.328
Right?
 

00:33:24.328 --> 00:33:30.096
I think it's interesting to
think in those terms about the

00:33:30.096 --> 00:33:33.029
relationship among devices.
 

00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:38.237
Now the point is that yes--and
this is what emerged from

00:33:38.237 --> 00:33:43.538
subsequent thought in the
Russian formalist movement--

00:33:43.538 --> 00:33:48.460
the first wave or phase had to
do strictly with sound,

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.640
but then they began to say,
"Well,

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.210
what about this notion of
device?

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:57.193
What about the way in
which--maybe the best thing to

00:33:57.193 --> 00:34:01.726
do if we're going to avoid
keeping once and again and again

00:34:01.726 --> 00:34:06.727
and again falling in to the trap
of making one aspect of the text

00:34:06.727 --> 00:34:12.264
subservient to other aspects,
merely there for the purpose of

00:34:12.264 --> 00:34:15.987
reinforcing content--
if we're going to avoid doing

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:17.876
this,
if we're going to see the text

00:34:17.876 --> 00:34:21.873
as a text that has a structure,
hadn't we better say that

00:34:21.873 --> 00:34:26.134
everything in it is form,
that everything in it is a

00:34:26.134 --> 00:34:26.650
device?
 

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.820
How are we going to do that?
 

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.445
Because it would certainly seem
that texts refer to

00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:32.400
things."
 

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:35.949
Well, yes, they do,
so why don't we call that to

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.188
which they refer--
for example,

00:34:38.188 --> 00:34:41.592
in the case of socialist
realism or indeed realism of any

00:34:41.592 --> 00:34:43.697
kind,
why don't we call that to which

00:34:43.697 --> 00:34:45.960
they refer the "society
function"?

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:50.936
Why don't we say, "Oh,
yeah, in a certain kind of

00:34:50.936 --> 00:34:57.690
text, the dominant device in
that text is referentiality,

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:02.177
is the way in which the real
world is hooked onto and that

00:35:02.177 --> 00:35:06.112
can be understood as a device
with respect to other

00:35:06.112 --> 00:35:07.530
devices."
 

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:11.193
It becomes, at certain moments
in the evolution of forms

00:35:11.193 --> 00:35:14.659
according to the Russian
formalists, the dominant.

00:35:14.659 --> 00:35:18.902
You see, this is the way in
which you avoid the form-content

00:35:18.902 --> 00:35:19.909
distinction.
 

00:35:19.909 --> 00:35:22.650
You say, "Oh,
so-called content.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:25.679
What other people call content
is a device like any other,

00:35:25.679 --> 00:35:30.496
and it engages in the struggle
for dominance with all the other

00:35:30.496 --> 00:35:35.389
devices that one can identify as
aspects of literature."

00:35:35.389 --> 00:35:38.880
Take the distinction between
plot and story.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.599
There you would really think
the formalists are on thin ice.

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:46.141
Plot, yes, we all agree that's
the constructed-ness of the

00:35:46.141 --> 00:35:46.639
story.
 

00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:49.563
That's the way the story is put
together, how the overcoat is

00:35:49.563 --> 00:35:50.440
made, and so on.
 

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.856
But story, that's what the plot
is about,

00:35:53.856 --> 00:35:58.289
and if that's what the plot is
about, how can we avoid calling

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:59.380
it content?
 

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.389
Well, it's very interesting.
 

00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:05.628
In the first place,
notice that sometimes story can

00:36:05.628 --> 00:36:09.360
be the dominant in obviously
formal terms.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.213
I think of that story that all
of you have probably read in

00:36:12.213 --> 00:36:14.969
school, The Things They
Carried by Tim O'Brien.

00:36:14.969 --> 00:36:20.498
It's a list of the contents of
the knapsack of a soldier during

00:36:20.498 --> 00:36:24.690
the Vietnam War,
just a list of the contents.

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:30.541
Of course, all these items in
the knapsack are evocative and

00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:34.309
what they do is they suggest a
plot.

00:36:34.309 --> 00:36:36.967
By the end of the story,
in other words,

00:36:36.967 --> 00:36:38.739
there is implied a plot.
 

00:36:38.739 --> 00:36:42.398
It's just the opposite of the
usual relationship between plot

00:36:42.398 --> 00:36:43.130
and story.
 

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:48.250
Ordinarily, a plot constructs
something which is implied--

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.150
that is to say,
that which happens,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:56.101
that which we can talk about in
paraphrase or as a subject

00:36:56.101 --> 00:37:01.273
matter outside the text--
but here in O'Brien's story,

00:37:01.273 --> 00:37:04.050
you're given the subject
matter.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:08.909
The subject matter itself
becomes the dominant device,

00:37:08.909 --> 00:37:13.786
and it implies in your
imagination a way to construct

00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:15.887
it,
but the way to construct it is

00:37:15.887 --> 00:37:16.809
not the dominant.
 

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:19.960
The way to construct it is
something that's up to you.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:24.137
What's the dominant in the text
is just the stuff,

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:28.061
the stuff in his knapsack
listed with as little

00:37:28.061 --> 00:37:30.449
implication as possible.
 

00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:34.108
So that's an instance of the
way in which you can see the

00:37:34.108 --> 00:37:37.699
relationship between plot and
story as a relationship of

00:37:37.699 --> 00:37:40.097
devices,
even though it's awfully

00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:42.764
tempting to say,
"Oh, the story's just the

00:37:42.764 --> 00:37:44.769
content and the plot's the
form"--

00:37:44.769 --> 00:37:46.389
but no.
 

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:50.536
The formalists don't want to
keep that distinction for the

00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:53.809
reasons that I have been trying
to develop.

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:59.369
Any device can be the dominant
at a given moment in the

00:37:59.369 --> 00:38:02.869
development of literary history.
 

00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:04.840
Any device can be the dominant.
 

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.208
In Hiawatha,
Longfellow's Hiawatha,

00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:10.199
meter is the device.
 

00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:13.059
You know how it goes.
 

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:20.184
Well, in Tennyson sound is the
device, "the murmurous

00:38:20.184 --> 00:38:26.309
haunt"--oh,
I have no memory at all today.

00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:29.030
I'm mixing it up with a line of
Keats, and I'm going to say

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:30.389
something else about Keats.
 

00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:33.103
I'll just tell you that
Tennyson thought the two most

00:38:33.103 --> 00:38:36.025
beautiful words in the English
language were "cellar

00:38:36.025 --> 00:38:39.050
door" and that audible
beauty was his preoccupation in

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.460
the making of poetry.
 

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.860
So we can say that the dominant
device in Tennyson's poetry,

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:47.849
as in much Victorian
poetry--certainly Swinburne's--

00:38:47.849 --> 00:38:53.139
is sound, and in Keats we can
say that the dominant device is

00:38:53.139 --> 00:38:56.132
imagery,
with his famous emphasis on

00:38:56.132 --> 00:39:00.856
synesthesia and the way in which
the various senses merge in the

00:39:00.856 --> 00:39:02.579
evocation of images.
 

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:06.054
In other words,
of course the academicians and

00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:09.530
the Symbolists were obsessed
with imagery,

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:12.699
but that's not to say that a
Russian formalist can't deal

00:39:12.699 --> 00:39:13.550
with imagery.
 

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.574
In a certain poet,
the image, the image patterns,

00:39:17.574 --> 00:39:22.018
can certainly be recognized as
the dominant device.

00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:24.382
That would probably be the
case, for example,

00:39:24.382 --> 00:39:25.079
with Keats.
 

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:29.722
In Gertrude Stein,
the dominant is repetition

00:39:29.722 --> 00:39:31.199
undoubtedly.
 

00:39:31.199 --> 00:39:36.853
In Wordsworth or Joyce or
Woolf, the dominant is perhaps

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.190
not formal.
 

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:42.748
Think of the feeling that
Wordsworth's blank verse just

00:39:42.748 --> 00:39:45.449
kind of disappears into prose.
 

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:48.367
I don't think that's quite
true, but there's a general

00:39:48.367 --> 00:39:50.347
feeling that,
as Matthew Arnold said,

00:39:50.347 --> 00:39:51.889
Wordsworth has no style.
 

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:55.730
In Wordsworth or Joyce or
Woolf, the dominant is the

00:39:55.730 --> 00:40:01.219
interiority of consciousness--
that is, the way in which what

00:40:01.219 --> 00:40:07.273
we call stream of consciousness
or the inwardness of thought

00:40:07.273 --> 00:40:11.349
motivates--
this is another word that you

00:40:11.349 --> 00:40:13.599
encounter in Eikhenbaum's
essay--

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:17.880
motivates everything else that
goes on in the text.

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.715
In other words,
an enormous variety of aspects

00:40:21.715 --> 00:40:24.016
of literature,
understood as

00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:28.619
"literariness,"
can become the dominant.

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:33.905
Now as soon as we start talking
about things like the dominant,

00:40:33.905 --> 00:40:38.340
we are also aware of the
evanescence of dominance.

00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.150
What is culinary in one
generation--

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.070
and here I'm alluding to a
passage quoted by Eikhenbaum--

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.516
for example,
the devices of crime fiction

00:40:49.516 --> 00:40:51.719
prior to the work of
Dostoyevsky,

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:54.018
become absolutely central.
 

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:56.329
He's thinking primarily of
Crime and Punishment,

00:40:56.329 --> 00:41:00.150
but this is true of other
works of Dostoyevsky as well,

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:05.141
so that the devices of the
dime-store detective novel

00:41:05.141 --> 00:41:09.750
actually then become the
motivating dominant of a

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:14.827
mainstream literary form,
but then they in turn run their

00:41:14.827 --> 00:41:18.230
course and are replaced by some
other dominant.

00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:20.715
In other words,
once you start thinking about

00:41:20.715 --> 00:41:23.822
the evanescence of dominance,
you're also thinking about

00:41:23.822 --> 00:41:25.010
literary history.
 

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.284
One of the most false
charges--and it was a charge

00:41:28.284 --> 00:41:31.960
leveled by Trotsky among many
others against the Russian

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.800
formalists--
is that they ignore history,

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.469
the same charge so often
leveled against the New Critics.

00:41:38.469 --> 00:41:40.389
They don't at all ignore
history.

00:41:40.389 --> 00:41:43.438
Almost from the beginning,
but increasingly during the

00:41:43.438 --> 00:41:46.655
twenties,
they turned their attention to

00:41:46.655 --> 00:41:50.190
the problems of literary
historiography,

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.619
and they said some rather
bracing things about it.

00:41:53.619 --> 00:42:01.329
In your text on page 012,
the left-hand column--

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:04.610
I'll keep referring to those
stamped numbers,

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:06.952
the left-hand side of your Tyco
[copy center]

00:42:06.952 --> 00:42:09.949
text--
we find Eikhenbaum evoking an

00:42:09.949 --> 00:42:15.353
exchange of opinion between the
ethnographic critic Veselovsky

00:42:15.353 --> 00:42:18.297
and Victor Shklovsky:
He [Shklovsky]

00:42:18.297 --> 00:42:20.427
[Eikhenbaum says,
a third of the way down]

00:42:20.427 --> 00:42:22.559
had encountered Veselovsky's
formula,

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:26.465
a formula broadly based on the
ethnographic principle that

00:42:26.465 --> 00:42:30.509
"the purpose of new form is
to express new content [new

00:42:30.509 --> 00:42:32.547
content,
in other words,

00:42:32.547 --> 00:42:36.378
being those social and
historical and environmental

00:42:36.378 --> 00:42:41.050
forces that oblige literary
techniques to change]Ã¢â¬Â¦

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:42.431
That's the
"ethnographic"

00:42:42.431 --> 00:42:42.880
position.
 

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.829
That's the word used.
 

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.353
It is obviously also the
materialist, or,

00:42:47.353 --> 00:42:48.489
social position.
 

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:54.400
History produces literature;
and not just literary history,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.750
but social history,
produces literature.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:03.413
Shklovsky disagreed and he
decided to advance a completely

00:43:03.413 --> 00:43:05.539
different point of view.
 

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:10.108
The work of art arises from a
background of other works and

00:43:10.108 --> 00:43:12.630
through association with them.
 

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:16.668
The form of a work of art is
defined by its relation to other

00:43:16.668 --> 00:43:19.967
works of art to forms existing
prior to itÃ¢â¬Â¦

00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:23.717
Not only parody [parody,
by the way, is a very,

00:43:23.717 --> 00:43:27.559
very broad term in Russian
formalist thought,

00:43:27.559 --> 00:43:30.250
in a way simply meaning
change--that is to say,

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:35.567
the way in which one text
inevitably riffs on another text

00:43:35.567 --> 00:43:41.257
in elaborating its own devices
and emphases and in search of a

00:43:41.257 --> 00:43:46.081
new kind of dominance],
but also any kind of work of

00:43:46.081 --> 00:43:50.900
art is created parallel to and
opposed to some kind of form.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.190
The purpose of new form is
not to express new content,

00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:59.239
but to change an old form which
has lost its aesthetic

00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:02.983
quality [that is to say,
lost its power to

00:44:02.983 --> 00:44:06.621
defamiliarize,
lost its power to take the film

00:44:06.621 --> 00:44:08.480
away from our eyes].
 

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.612
Now this--as you think about
it, you say to yourself,

00:44:12.612 --> 00:44:17.460
That's all very bracing and
daring but Veselovsky is right.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:17.889
&gt;
 

00:44:17.889 --> 00:44:21.340
We know literature is produced
by historical forces.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.530
What does it mean,
a new form comes about only to

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.188
replace an old form which has
ceased to be aesthetically

00:44:28.188 --> 00:44:28.920
viable?
 

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:30.179
How does that happen?
 

00:44:30.179 --> 00:44:35.096
You know, you've got to appeal
to social forces if you're going

00:44:35.096 --> 00:44:36.920
to talk about change.
 

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:40.164
That really does seem to me to
be the spontaneous conclusion we

00:44:40.164 --> 00:44:41.369
are inclined to draw.
 

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:44.701
That's why I gave you (to
offset this conclusion) the

00:44:44.701 --> 00:44:47.199
extraordinary passage on your
sheet,

00:44:47.199 --> 00:44:52.902
the end of Tynjanov's "On
Literary Evolution,"

00:44:52.902 --> 00:44:56.003
written also 1927,
written also,

00:44:56.003 --> 00:44:58.779
in other words,
in response to Trotsky's

00:44:58.779 --> 00:45:01.340
Literature and
Revolution.

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.400
This is what Tynjanov says:
In formalist historiography,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.079
the prime significance of major
social factors is not at all

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:11.110
discarded.
 

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.905
[In other words,
we're not just playing a game

00:45:13.905 --> 00:45:14.340
here.
 

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:17.827
We, too, understand the
relevance of what we call

00:45:17.827 --> 00:45:20.224
"the society
function."]

00:45:20.224 --> 00:45:24.440
Rather it must be elucidated in
its full extent through the

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.710
problem of the evolution of
literature.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:31.197
This is in contrast to the
establishment of the direct

00:45:31.197 --> 00:45:34.619
influence of major social
factors [and here comes the

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:39.324
amazing part of this utterance,
which I think is truly

00:45:39.324 --> 00:45:43.355
remarkable]
which replaces the study of

00:45:43.355 --> 00:45:49.721
evolution of literature with the
study of the modification of

00:45:49.721 --> 00:45:53.864
literary works,
that is to say their

00:45:53.864 --> 00:45:55.110
deformation.
 

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.320
You see the distinction.
 

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.460
In natural selection,
certain things happen.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.380
There is mutation.
 

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:10.552
New genes emerge as dominant,
no longer recessive or latent,

00:46:10.552 --> 00:46:13.739
and organisms change.
 

00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:17.869
That's evolution,
but organisms change against a

00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:21.911
backdrop--you know,
organisms are changing like

00:46:21.911 --> 00:46:22.789
crazy.
 

00:46:22.789 --> 00:46:26.795
In comes the prehensile thumb,
and the next thing you know you

00:46:26.795 --> 00:46:30.206
get a colossal earthquake,
and the possessor of the

00:46:30.206 --> 00:46:33.030
prehensile thumb disappears from
the earth--

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.664
which is to say,
very possibly the human species

00:46:36.664 --> 00:46:38.289
will never develop.
 

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.380
That's the modification
of a form.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.829
It strikes me that it's a
remarkable distinction.

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:53.672
You will get in any period
spontaneously the sorts of

00:46:53.672 --> 00:46:58.050
impulses that bring about
socialist realism,

00:46:58.050 --> 00:47:03.224
but if you have a ukase
from above telling you that if

00:47:03.224 --> 00:47:07.699
you're going to write,
it has to be socialist realism,

00:47:07.699 --> 00:47:09.420
that's a modification.
 

00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:14.518
That is the modification of
what would and does evolve in

00:47:14.518 --> 00:47:18.889
and of itself within an
understanding of literary

00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:20.619
historiography.
 

00:47:20.619 --> 00:47:23.554
The distinction,
it seems to me,

00:47:23.554 --> 00:47:25.070
is compelling.
 

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.708
The only objection to be made
to it perhaps indeed is that

00:47:28.708 --> 00:47:31.518
much of the time,
it's just more trouble than

00:47:31.518 --> 00:47:33.369
it's worth to enforce it.
 

00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:38.565
It would drive us into such
baroque circumlocutions and

00:47:38.565 --> 00:47:42.030
avoidances of the obvious to
say,

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:44.112
"Oh, social factors have
nothing to do with this,"

00:47:44.112 --> 00:47:44.960
&gt;
 

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:48.222
that we might as well just sort
of--not give the distinction up,

00:47:48.222 --> 00:47:51.072
because I think it's very
important always to have it in

00:47:51.072 --> 00:47:52.420
the back of our minds.
 

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:56.463
It's important in Darwinian
terms to have it in the back of

00:47:56.463 --> 00:48:00.230
our minds, and that's what
Tynjanov is insisting on.

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:02.853
That's why he calls his essay
"On Literary

00:48:02.853 --> 00:48:04.452
Evolution,"
not literary

00:48:04.452 --> 00:48:06.391
"revolution"
but literary

00:48:06.391 --> 00:48:07.989
"evolution."
 

00:48:07.989 --> 00:48:11.443
I think it's terribly important
to keep the distinction in the

00:48:11.443 --> 00:48:13.710
back of our minds even if we
find it,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.887
in practical terms,
well nigh impossible and

00:48:16.887 --> 00:48:21.543
possibly even in many contexts a
waste of time to be perpetually

00:48:21.543 --> 00:48:22.800
enforcing it.
 

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.340
It is nevertheless a
distinction that does exist,

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.449
once you think about it,
that deserves to exist and

00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:34.119
deserves to be remembered when
we think about the variety of

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:37.230
ways in which literary history
can be written.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.789
Now I'm going to stop there.
 

00:48:38.789 --> 00:48:39.659
Time's up.
 

00:48:39.659 --> 00:48:41.809
There is a little more to say,
I think,

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:47.199
and certainly the possible ways
in which Russian formalism is

00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:52.409
subject to critique need quickly
to be passed in review.

00:48:52.409 --> 00:48:56.320
We'll do all this next time
before we get into Saussure.

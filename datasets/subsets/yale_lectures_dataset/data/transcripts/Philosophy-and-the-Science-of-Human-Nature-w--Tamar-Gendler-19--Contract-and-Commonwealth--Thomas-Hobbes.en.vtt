00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.990
PROFESSOR: So we have two basic
agenda items today.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.570
The first is to finish up
briefly our discussion of

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.010
punishment from last lecture.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.810
And the second is to start with
the third unit of the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.250
course, that is the unit that's
concerned not with our

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.480
status as individuals trying
to cultivate a kind of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.170
internal harmony, nor with our
status as individuals in local

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.310
relations with others of a moral
or immoral sort, but

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.800
rather with our status as
members of a community.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.030
And you'll remember from Plato's
Republic, the text

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.290
with which we begin and with
which we'll end the course,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.060
that Plato sees there being a
direct parallel between the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.240
individual and the community,
between what's mandated for

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.560
the harmonious soul on the one
hand, and what's required for

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.980
a community to stay stable
on the other.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.450
And one of the tacit themes
that will underlie our

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.140
discussion in this final unit of
the course are the ways in

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.310
which that parallel
is manifest.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.760
Now to some extent our
discussion of punishment

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.410
provided a microcosm
of this transition.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.380
You'll recall that in the first
lecture on punishment we

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.350
looked at three questions.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.110
We tried to articulate in a
fairly precise sense what we

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.840
meant by the notion of
civil punishment.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.420
And then we looked at two
families of justification for

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.790
civil punishment.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.110
A family of deontological or
desert oriented theories on

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.100
the one hand--

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.910
theories that look at what
somebody deserves.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.270
And on the other hand,
we looked at some

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.760
consequentialist theories--

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.030
theories that try to justify
punishment on the basis of its

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.530
consequences.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.340
And for each of those theories,
we asked ourselves

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.630
how reasonable the
justifications are that they

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.175
offer and what source
of behaviors do

00:02:16.175 --> 00:02:17.980
they seem to mandate.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.240
And here we had the same sort
of structure that we have

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.540
found throughout the course.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.380
On the one hand, an articulation
of a principled

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.730
framework for understanding
a large segment of human

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.830
behavior that tries to lay
down rules and guiding

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.870
principles by which we ought
to structure behavior.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.660
And on the other, we
had intuitions

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.920
about particular cases.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.270
And we found that here, as
elsewhere, for many of you at

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.070
least, certainly for the
students in my section and for

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.780
the students in the sections
of the TAs that I've spoken

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.270
to, that there was a challenge
reconciling on the one hand,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.450
the philosophical framework that
seemed truly compelling

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.650
and on the other hand, the
psychological factors that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.760
seemed to be pulling us in one
direction or another with

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.430
regard to particular cases.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.390
So what we looked out at in our
a discussion on Thursday

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.400
were some attempts to provide
systematic explorations of

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.670
some of these psychological
phenomena: factors that seemed

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.970
to exacerbate people's desire
to inflict punishment, at

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.470
least most people, most of the
time, in Western society.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.270
And factors that tend
to mitigate it.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.530
And we also talked a bit about
the role of moral luck in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.089
underlying lying our responses
to punishment.

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.140
What I want to turn to in the
first part of today's lecture

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.930
is the residual question that
we had in the context of our

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.580
punishment lecture.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.870
Namely, to look at the question
of how on the one

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.790
hand civil punishment works,
and on the other, how

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.560
punishment works in a much
more personal context.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.610
So you'll recall that-- sorry,
I guess we don't have the

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.430
final version of these
slides up.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.940
OK.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.710
There was to have been a slide
here-- which is not this one--

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.615
that connected our theories of
punishment to our discussion

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:30.700
in Alan Kazdin.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.560
What we have instead is an
earlier slide, where I

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.160
suggested a connection between
the work of Alan Kazdin on the

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.520
one hand and Aristotle's
Nicomachean

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.350
Ethics on the other.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.740
You'll recall that when we were
trying to think about the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.225
question how do we cultivate
virtue, I suggested that one

00:04:49.225 --> 00:04:54.350
of the places to look in your
contemporary culture at the

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.800
question "how do we help people
become that which we

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.340
hope they will be?" are in
scientifically informed,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.070
compassionate, parenting
guides.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.190
And it is, I think, an
interesting question to ask

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.510
with respect to punishment.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.070
So you'll recall that when we
had the slide with four kinds

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.540
of justification for punishment
in the earlier

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.540
lecture, we had on the one hand
the utilitarian and the

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.410
desert-based theory.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.550
But we also had, at the bottom
of that slide, two motivations

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.710
for punishment that look on the
one hand at the victim and

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.920
on the other hand at the
perpetrator, and aimed somehow

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.970
to reconcile their situation.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.570
And what those motivations for
punishment suggested is that

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:56.310
with respect to the victim, what
matters is restitution

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.940
and with respect to the
perpetrator, if we are truly

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.155
forward-looking, what matters
is rehabilitation.

00:06:05.155 --> 00:06:11.300
And the question is whether
those motivations are

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.700
sufficiently forceful and
sufficiently powerful to

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.550
capture what we're
looking for from

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.850
punishment in a civil context.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.650
It seems fairly clear that those
motivations are at least

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.120
close to sufficient in
a personal context.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.860
And it's to that question that
Alan Kazdin's discussion in

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.180
the context of this encoding of
cultural practices in the

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.250
parenting guide that we read.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:49.750
So Kazdin points out that if
your goal is something akin

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.380
you to rehabilitation, if the
goal of punishment is what

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.090
forward-looking theories
suggest, that is the changing

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.980
of future behavior on the part
on the individual who has

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.920
violated social norms in such a
way that you can predictably

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.650
expect them to behave
prosocially, then it's

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.110
incredibly important not merely
to articulate what sort

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:23.790
of behavior is disallowed,
but also to provide an

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:29.450
articulation of what sort
of behavior is desired.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:32.810
"Instead," says Kazdin, "of
thinking of your child's

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.760
behavior in terms of what you
don't want, start thinking in

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.400
terms of what you do want.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.780
When you get rid of a behavior
by rewarding its opposite, the

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:49.900
effects of the getting rid are
stronger and last longer than

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.280
if you punish the undesired
behavior."

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.590
And all of you had the
opportunity to think about

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.530
this structure of practice
in the opening

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.780
segment of the course.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:08.960
The very idea of focusing on
what it is that you hope to

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.100
cultivate as a habit in
yourself, and then engaging in

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:18.669
behaviors that allow that sort
of practice to become

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:23.340
instinctive to you, was one of
the central lessons of the

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.000
first unit of the course.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.830
The best way we learned to build
up a behavior that you

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.230
want is through reinforced
practice.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:37.440
And Kazdin goes on to suggest,
in the context of punishment,

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.490
that punishment teaches
what not to do.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:45.810
It says that particular behavior
is unacceptable.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.570
But a behavior is one
among a panoply of

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.820
possible modes of action.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.450
And simply ruling out one of
them doesn't guarantee that

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.930
what will replace it is
something prosocial.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.450
So he writes in a very specific
context of fighting,

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.020
if you punish your child for
fighting with her brother, it

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:07.990
will indeed stop that fight.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.750
The next time there's a conflict
between them though,

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.890
fighting will still be in the
daughter's repertoire, the

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:15.360
default setting.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.540
You haven't done anything
about changing that.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:22.350
Explaining in words that
fighting is bad won't change

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.410
the state of behavior either.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.870
You need to develop another
way of behaving.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.800
You need to promote the positive
opposite to get

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.230
another response locked in.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.800
Now the question is whether
there is any possibility of

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:46.760
generalizing this profoundly
correct lesson about what one

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.450
does in deeply personal
interactions

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.080
to a societal context?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.110
As I pointed out when we read
Plato's Republic, it begins

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.850
with the suggestion that if
you want to understand the

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.240
structure of the soul, you
need to understand the

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.990
structure of society.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.200
And if you want to understand
the structure of society, you

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.520
need to understand the structure
of the soul.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:21.170
In some ways, asking the
apparently absurd question

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:25.680
"does a parenting guide have
anything to teach us about the

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:30.260
criminal justice system?" is
to ask the fundamental

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:34.290
question of Plato's Republic--

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:39.560
does what we do when we engage
in the most intimate and

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:45.210
personal of attempts to
cultivate in others behaviors

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:49.270
that will allow them
to thrive--

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:54.980
does thinking about that teach
us anything about how society

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.940
ought to structure its
institutional practices?

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:04.000
And Kazdin gives some indication
that he is thinking

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.560
at least implicitly
along those lines.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.690
He writes, "Punishment can
fail for many reasons.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.570
One of them is that reward for
misbehaving is often more

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:17.550
immediate and reliable than
punishment." And goes on to

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.030
suggest, not in detail, but just
as a hint, that a look at

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.910
the criminal justice
system's normal

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.220
operations makes that clear.

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.930
If you steal, you get what
you stole right away.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.960
You are therefore reinforced in
a very local sense in the

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.230
bad behavior by an
immediate reward.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:42.740
If you experience a delayed
punishing consequence, that

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:46.010
punishment is doomed to failure
as a method for

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.840
changing behavior.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.570
What's required if punishment is
to have a totally deterrent

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.960
effect is somehow for the
calculation of the cost of the

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.360
punishment to enter in at
the moment of practice.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.700
Kazdin writes, "One must
eliminate the immediate

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.850
reinforcer for the punished
behavior if possible, and

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.140
that's hard to do."

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:18.080
You'll recall long ago, we had a
picture of Ulysses trying to

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.750
get past the sirens.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:23.630
It was a beautiful 19th century
portrait of Ulysses on

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:28.290
a ship, tied to a mast, with
the rowers beside him, with

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.070
their ears blocked.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.150
And that was a slide that we
looked at in the context of

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.100
how you overcome immediate
temptation.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.920
And we talked about, in our
discussion of Nozick on

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:47.210
principles and our discussion of
Ariely on procrastination,

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:53.320
what sort of strategies there
are for recalculating or

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:59.140
recalibrating our assessment of
potential immediate payoff.

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:04.645
Thinking about punishment in its
broadest sense gives us a

00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:07.620
way of thinking about
that question

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.350
from yet another direction.

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:16.130
And, as you'll see, that issue
is going to reemerge very soon

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:19.670
when we start thinking
about Hobbes.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:22.270
So I leave this puzzle--

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.610
or this multi-part puzzle--
for you, as a question.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.580
Punishment illuminated for
us, on the one hand, the

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.380
distinction between utilitarian
and deontological

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.820
moral theory.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.520
It got us thinking about the
symmetric or asymmetric

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.050
relation between praise
and blame.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.760
And it gave us yet another venue
for thinking about the

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.880
relation between the personal
and the societal.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.890
So with that, I want to move
to the general topic of

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.320
today's lecture.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.190
So the fundamental question of
political legitimacy, as you

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.640
know from the brief reading
that you did before the

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:12.940
Hobbes, is the question of why
it is ever legitimate for

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.970
there to be such thing
as a state.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:24.920
It is an astounding fact about
21st century human existence

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.880
that of the roughly seven
billion people who live on

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:35.180
this planet at this time, nearly
all of them are subject

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:42.480
to rules and regulations that
are imposed on them by a

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.340
governing body--

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.020
a government--

00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:51.590
as a result simply of their
having been born within the

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:56.750
confines a particular
territory.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:04.730
It's worth thinking for a moment
about why and perhaps

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.640
whether that fact
is legitimate.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.200
And this question--

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.780
what makes the state
legitimate--

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.830
is the one that we'll address
in the context of this final

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.760
unit of the course.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.640
So let's begin by going back to
a passage right before the

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.280
one that we focused on so
intently at the beginning of

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.440
the term from Plato's
Republic.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.780
So you will remember right
before the discussion of the

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.810
ring of Gyges, Glaucon provides
an account of what he

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.290
calls the nature and
origins of justice.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.410
And here is what he said.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:53.850
He says, "They say to do
injustice is naturally good

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:57.800
and to suffer injustice is bad,
but that the badness of

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:02.070
suffering it so far exceeds the
goodness of doing it that

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.080
those who have done and suffered
injustice and tasted

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:10.190
both, but who lack the power to
avoid suffering it, decide

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.110
that it's profitable to come
to an agreement with each

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:19.170
other to neither do injustice
nor to suffer it."

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.240
So the picture is this.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.310
Suppose we have two shepherds.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:31.860
And the one steals the
other's horses.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:37.585
From that, he gets pleasure
of say 15.

00:16:37.585 --> 00:16:42.480
At the same time, the one
whose horses were stolen

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.720
experiences a dissatisfaction,
first 15 at the loss of his

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.550
horses and then an additional
displeasure

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:54.900
at having been robbed.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.589
So he turns and steals
the other horses--

00:16:58.589 --> 00:17:01.140
sorry, that was supposed to
be more nicely animated.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.290
There we go.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.770
--feeling the pleasure of 15,
where his opponent feels a

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.900
displeasure of 25.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:16.230
So the thought is that both
recognize that in a situation

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:22.100
where stealing is the norm, both
have the potential to end

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:26.740
up worse off than they would
have had they just stuck with

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.990
their original property.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:34.080
As a result, suggests Glaucon,
they come together and they

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:40.450
form some sort of interpersonal
agreement.

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.790
Moreover, they institutionalize
it.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.980
As a result says Glaucon, "they
begin to make laws and

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:51.450
covenants and what the law
commands, they call lawful and

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.680
just. This," says Glaucon,
'is the origin

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.370
and essence of justice.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.250
It is intermediate between the
best and the worst. The best

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.570
thing to do injustice without
paying the penalty.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.150
The worst to separate without
being able to take revenge.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.710
Justice this is a mean between
two extremes."

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:19.520
What we have in this 2,000 year
old text is a preliminary

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.510
articulation of what has come
to be known as the social

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.820
contract tradition in political
philosophy.

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:36.190
This is the view that it is
because in some sense living

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:44.140
in a society structured by laws
is advantageous for all

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.290
of us, that the state
is legitimate.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:54.690
On this picture, what makes it
reasonable that seven billion

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.420
people on this planet live their
lives as a result of

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.720
having been born in a particular
place under the

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.650
auspices of a particular
government, what makes that

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:11.190
legitimate is the fact that as
an aggregate and in fact as

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:15.930
individuals, they are better off
than they would be without

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.430
that structure having
been in place.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.690
And that is the fundamental
argument that lies behind the

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:29.150
text that we read from Thomas
Hobbes' Leviathan.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:34.380
So Hobbes, as you know from
reading the text, lived

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.700
roughly at the time
of Shakespeare.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:42.170
He lived from 1588 to 1679.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.970
So just as he was born,
Shakespeare's first works were

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.770
being produced.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:47.870
And you can see--

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.510
sorry, they should stay next to
each other for a moment--

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.060
that they wear the
same outfit.

00:19:53.060 --> 00:19:55.730
My animation is very
active today.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.870
So, Hobbes was British.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.130
He's best known for his work in
political philosophy, but

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.480
he also did work in linguistics
and mathematics.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.120
And it's important to realize as
you think through the ways

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:13.110
in which the text that we read
is extraordinarily systematic,

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:17.220
that Hobbes was highly
influenced by the idea that it

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:22.470
would be possible to derive
very broad principles of

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.630
political theory from very
basic facts about human

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:28.920
psychology.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.490
And the idea was to base the
reasoning here on something

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.580
like the geometrical method,
where you start with a few

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.640
very simple axioms, you have
some rules of derivation, and

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.920
from them you can build up
rather elaborate systems. In

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.480
particular, Hobbes thought it
would be possible to derive

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.510
political philosophy from
thinking about psychology, to

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.030
derive psychology from thinking
about physiology, and

00:20:57.030 --> 00:21:01.720
to derive physiology from
thinking about physics.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.900
Facts about the physical world
constrained facts about

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.060
physiology.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.280
Those in turn constrained
facts about psychology.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.410
And those in turn determined
the nature

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.350
all political theory.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.790
So the text that we read for
today is primarily concerned

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:23.030
with these two last stages.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:28.900
The text we read is from Hobbes'
1651 book Leviathan.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.620
And I reproduced this
frontispiece here because we

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:40.170
are, all of us right now,
sitting about 100 yards from a

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.200
copy of this first edition.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.870
And when I taught this class as
a small seminar, one of the

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:51.040
most exciting things that we did
was to take a field trip

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.380
to the Beinecke Library and
to see this in person.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.080
And all of you as Yale students
are free to walk over

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:03.920
there and to make an appointment
to look at this.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.710
What's amazing about the
frontispiece is both the

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.560
visual imagery on the bottom
and the visual

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.320
imagery on the top.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.780
So Hobbes, remember, is
concerned with providing a

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:22.370
philosophical basis to justify
the secular state.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:27.040
And on the bottom what he has
is a juxtaposition of the

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.240
tools of the secular state
with the tools

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.950
of religious authority.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:37.200
So he's talking about the
relation between the castle

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.730
and the church, between the
might of weaponry and the

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:44.630
might of religion.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.180
What's relevant for our
discussion here is this

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.810
incredible image on the top--

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:56.950
the image of the sovereign
composed of hundreds of

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:02.640
individuals, each of whom has,
on Hobbes' picture of things,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.440
rationally decided to give
up his for her right to

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:13.380
self-authority on certain
questions in order to

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:17.150
guarantee the stability
of society.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:23.780
So let's ask the question, how
does Hobbes get to this

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.200
conclusion?

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.900
And what are the fundamental
questions

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.320
he's trying to answer?

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.370
So, as I said, he starts out
with a discussion simply of

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.400
what human reasoning
looks like.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.260
What's our sensory
system like?

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.760
How does language allow
us to communicate?

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:48.200
And he goes on from there to
talk about human psychology

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.880
and the legitimacy of the state,
concluding with a very

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.880
broad discussion of the relation
between the civil

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.850
state and religious law.

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.980
The questions he's asking are
the questions we're going to

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.460
ask for the next
four lectures.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.370
What makes the state
legitimate?

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:15.880
Hobbes' answer is having a
civil state, having civil

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:22.110
society, is the only effective
means of what he calls

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.290
commodious self-preservation.

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:27.190
And I'll say a bit about
what that amounts to.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.000
And the second question, what
can we do to guarantee the

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.800
stability of the state?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:37.670
And Hobbes' rather controversial
answer here is

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:41.610
that it's only by means of
putting in place some sort of

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:46.860
absolute sovereign, only by
abdicating a certain amount of

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.180
personal freedom, that the
state's continued existence is

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.030
guaranteed.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:57.020
So how does the argument go?

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.560
We started our reading for
today with the incredibly

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:08.600
famous passages from Book I,
Chapter 13, of Leviathan,

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.860
where Hobbes make the
following argument.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:19.620
He says, with respect to the
possibility of stealing one

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:22.710
another's property and
potentially taking one

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:28.250
another's lives, human beings
are relatively equal.

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:34.210
They are physically equal in
the sense that each of them

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:40.520
has the live possibility of
killing and of being killed.

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:45.180
And they are mentally equal,
intellectually equal, in the

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:52.110
sense that human beings on the
whole are capable of using

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.560
experience to learn how to
navigate their environment.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.970
And in a somewhat coy argument,
he suggests that

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:04.800
everybody thinks himself to be
somewhat clever, and that the

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.090
best evidence of rough equality
is that each is

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.730
contented with his share.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:16.760
From this comes the first
premise of the Hobbesian

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:24.660
argument, that when we have this
sort of rough equality in

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.110
physical and intellectual
strength, there is an

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:35.050
"equality of hope in attaining
our ends." Everybody can

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.630
reasonably expect that
pursuing their own

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.120
self-interest will not

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.154
necessarily be a futile endeavor.

00:26:47.154 --> 00:26:52.460
Since, however, self-interests
conflict--

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:56.520
since, roughly speaking, I want
to get as much as I can

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:01.550
get and you want to get as
much as you can get--

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:06.410
Hobbes suggests that the result
of this rough equality,

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:09.590
this expectation of the
possibility of achieving one's

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:15.960
goals, coupled with the fact
that goals of this sort often

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:23.880
involve taking of property, we
find three sources of conflict

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.120
among individuals.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:30.430
The first Hobbes calls
competition, where the goal is

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:36.070
I want to gain control of stuff
over which you currently

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:37.530
have control.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.420
Note that this use out the
term 'your stuff' at this

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.520
point is still metaphorical.

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:45.240
Right.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.100
There's no such thing, says
Hobbes, as property in the

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.480
state of nature.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.210
I want to control things
that you control.

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:57.560
And the consequence of that,
says Hobbes, is that I will

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:02.080
engage in violent behavior to
get things that are now under

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.210
your control.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:09.670
The second cause of conflict in
the state of nature is the

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:13.370
preemptive version of this.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:19.110
The recognition that I want to
keep control of those things

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:23.850
over which I have control, with
the resulting action that

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:29.600
I may preemptively strike to
preserve my possessions.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.450
So the first is simply about
the acquisition of objects.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:36.510
The second involves an
application of intelligence, a

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.910
recognition that someone might
try to acquire things over

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:44.370
which I have control and that
in order to prevent that, I

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.550
need to act preemptively.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:51.320
And the third, says Hobbes, is
this uniquely psychological

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.790
feature of human being,
reminding us yet again of our

00:28:56.790 --> 00:28:59.190
fundamentally social nature.

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.026
And that is what Hobbes
calls glory.

00:29:02.026 --> 00:29:05.310
The goal here being
reputation.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.046
I seek your admiration.

00:29:07.046 --> 00:29:14.260
And in so doing, I engage in
violence to earn your respect.

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:19.120
Hobbes thinks that in the state
of nature, this sort of

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:22.560
conflict is inevitable.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.880
In particular, when there is
an assumption of rough

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.890
equality and an assumption of a
desirous self-interest, the

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.310
result will be a war, says
Hobbes, "of every man against

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:42.510
every man." Not necessarily
a hot war in the sense of

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:49.040
violence going on at every
moment, but a recognition that

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:56.220
at any given moment that which
feels secure, might be lost.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:30:02.710
And we known from living at a
time when terrorist threat

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:09.650
induces in many of us a feeling
of standing fear, how

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:16.600
dangerous to the psyche it is
to feel that one cannot be

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:21.030
certain or safe in one's
surroundings.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:28.080
Interestingly, the threat of
things going wrong has almost

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:35.010
as powerful a psychological
effect in anticipation as the

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:38.430
actuality of things
going wrong.

00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:42.470
The result of this, says Hobbes,
is that there is no

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:46.360
industry, no culture,
no navigation.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:51.070
He writes rather poetically, "in
such condition there is no

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:55.490
place for industry because the
fruit thereof is uncertain.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:58.960
And consequently, there's no
culture of the earth, no

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.240
navigation, no use of
commodities that may be

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:07.480
imported by sea, no commodious
buildings, no instruments of

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.710
moving and removing such things
as require much force,

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:14.650
no knowledge of the face of the
earth, no account of time,

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.180
no arts, no letters, no society,
and what is worst of

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:24.120
all, continual fear and danger
of violent death."

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.680
It's important to think about
how many features--

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.100
in fact, all the features
of your daily life--

00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:39.140
rely on an assumption of a
certain kind of stability, a

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:42.080
certain kind of predictability.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.260
And without that kind of
stability and predictability

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.270
says Hobbes, there's
continual fear and

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.010
danger of violent death.

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:54.400
And life is, this being the most
famous quote from Hobbes'

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.220
Leviathan, --life is "solitary,
poor, nasty,

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.960
brutish, and short."

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:08.750
Hobbes goes on to suggest that
this rather unpleasant picture

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:15.290
of human psychological
tendencies that he's painted

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:22.860
in this famous passage is one
which is rather widely shared.

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:28.330
He asks you to think about
whether when you travel, you

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:34.110
lock your doors and whether when
you leave the library,

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.930
you bring your computer
with you.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:40.880
He doesn't ask about the
computer, in those words.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:47.490
But in pointing out the tendency
of people to protect

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.500
themselves with respect to
their property and their

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:57.390
person, he asked "whether you do
not as much accuse mankind

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:04.050
by your actions as," says
Hobbes, "I do by my words."

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.710
So that's the beginning
of the argument in

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.740
favor of the state.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:14.660
Rough equality, a tendency to
want what others also want,

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.300
and a consequent state of war.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:23.700
Hobbes steps back for a
minute then and makes

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:26.960
two important caveats.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:31.740
The first is that he points
out that in order for his

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.080
argument to work--

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:37.770
remember his argument is going
to be that the reason it's

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:42.790
legitimate for seven billion
people to be under the

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:46.690
political control of state is
because if they weren't, they

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:49.190
would be worse off.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.239
Hobbes says that argument works
regardless of whether

00:33:53.239 --> 00:33:55.300
the state of nature is actually

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.639
something that happened.

00:33:57.639 --> 00:34:01.130
The argument doesn't turn
on historical fact.

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.409
The question, says Hobbes, is
what manner of life there

00:34:05.409 --> 00:34:11.739
would be were there no
common power to fear.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:16.159
And he points out--

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.520
so that's the first point
that he makes there.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:25.870
He then goes on to point out
that most of the things which

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:31.909
we take for granted as part of
how we organize our lives

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:35.960
would be absent without the
existence of social

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.610
structures.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:43.460
The notions of justice and
injustice, says Hobbes, are

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.620
social notions.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.410
They depend on there being rules
which can be violated

00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:53.270
and some rules which
can be upheld.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:58.130
Likewise, in exactly the way
that I flipped up four slides

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:03.470
ago, there it is in the state
of nature no notion of

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.130
ownership or legal
control as such.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:13.330
All there is is possession
by force.

00:35:13.330 --> 00:35:17.490
So that's the nadir of
Hobbes' argument.

00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.500
It's really bad news.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:23.920
It's solitary, poor, nasty,
brutish, and short.

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.080
And the question now becomes
what could possibly allow us

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.300
to escape from such
a situation?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:37.010
And Hobbes suggests in the
conclusion of Chapter 13 that

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.780
there are three sorts of
motivations that might help

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:42.860
people get out of this
circumstance.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:47.480
One is a natural
fear of death.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:51.910
The second is a "desire of such
things as are necessary

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.710
for commodious living." Those
are all the sorts of things

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.440
that we just talked about.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.600
The things that come only from
predictable possibilities of

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.010
cooperation--

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:07.900
buildings, learning,
comfort, stability.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:12.960
And finally says Hobbes,
there is a hope--

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.530
the counterpart of the equality
held with regard to

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:19.270
the state of nature
earlier on--

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:24.190
that "by one's industry," it
would be possible to obtain

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.510
those things that are necessary
for commodious

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:30.480
living if only there were stable
circumstances to allow

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:33.610
the efforts to persist.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:38.050
So we move now to the
fundamental argument of

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.620
Hobbes, which involves, in
the excerpts we read, the

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.280
derivations of what he calls the
first, second, and third

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.340
laws of nature.

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.150
So what I want to do first is
to introduce you to Hobbes'

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:53.380
terminology for this.

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.340
And then I'm going to give you
the first, second, and third

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:57.360
laws of nature.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:00.750
And with that we'll
close the lecture.

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:04.870
So Hobbes talks about rights
on the one hand

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:07.450
and laws on the other.

00:37:07.450 --> 00:37:11.660
A right of nature, which Hobbes
thinks is fundamental,

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.340
and we will hear about this
again when we do our reading

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:20.480
from Robert Nozick for next
Thursday, is the idea

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.340
articulated in the founding
documents of the nation in

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:30.960
whose boundaries we now sit,
that each human being is

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:36.780
fundamentally in some
profound sense free.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:42.900
Each human being has rights,
that Hobbes explicitly calls

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:51.110
inalienable, to engage in
whatever way he or she can to

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:53.450
self-preservation.

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.660
That's a fundamental assumption
of Western

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.570
political philosophy.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:07.560
Liberty, on Hobbes' picture,
is a rather narrow notion.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:13.040
All he means by this is the lack
of external impediment.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.330
Hobbes considers contracts that
are entered into out of

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:22.000
fear to be nonetheless
binding.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.200
The third term that we need from
Hobbes to understand the

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.540
rest of the argument is the
idea of a law of nature.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:37.520
And this is where the trick of
Hobbes' reasoning takes place.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.880
Hobbes says that while it's
true that all of us have

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:46.200
fundamental rights to liberty,
it's also true that there are

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:52.100
things which are binding upon
us as a result of reason.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:57.010
There are general rules which
reason can lead us to

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:01.640
recognize, that specify what
is forbidden and what is

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.020
required to preserve life.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:10.030
And that once we discover that
these sorts of things are

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:15.630
required to preserve life,
it becomes mandatory

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:19.510
for us to do them.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:26.870
So the idea of law of nature
is the idea that we can

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.030
determine what it would be
that would allow us to

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:32.550
preserve our lives.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.760
And that it then becomes
mandatory for us to do that.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.370
So whereas a right is a kind of
freedom, a law is a kind of

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.020
constraint.

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:47.730
So what are the laws of nature
according to Hobbes?

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.390
The first law of nature
he derived as follows.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.460
He says, as we know from Chapter
13, that the natural

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:59.520
condition of human beings is
a war of all against all.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.630
But that as we know from the
right of nature, each of us

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.980
can do whatever it takes to
preserve ourselves, including

00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:11.130
harming others.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:17.580
The result of this is a lack
of security for all of us.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:24.946
Once we recognize this, says
Hobbes, reason tells us it is

00:40:24.946 --> 00:40:31.310
a general rule of reason that we
are required to "seek peace

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.790
if there is a chance
of obtaining peace.

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:40.630
And, if not, to engage
in war."

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.220
So the first law of nature,
according to

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.750
Hobbes, has two clauses.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:46.540
It has a peace clause--

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:48.150
a must clause.

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.900
If there's a chance of
cooperation, you're required

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.460
to do it-- seek peace
and follow it.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.560
And a war clause, which gives
you a permission.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.310
If you cannot have a guarantee
of peace, you may defend

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:07.730
yourself by all means we can
to defend ourselves.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:14.190
Now, the first law of nature
raises a puzzle because it

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.980
asks us what it would take for
there to be a chance of

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.120
obtaining peace.

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.220
The peace clause only kicks in
if other people are doing the

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:26.580
same thing as you.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:31.910
And the second law of nature
gives voice to how that first

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:35.180
clause is to be satisfied.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.890
Hobbes says you need to be
willing to lay down your

00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:41.430
rights to the extent that others
are willing to do the

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.080
same with the aim of promoting
a peaceful state.

00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.500
You need, says Hobbes, to
"content yourself with as much

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:53.180
liberty against others
as others have

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:56.400
against you." Now.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.550
what we will talk about in the
next lecture is a problem that

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.090
arises from this picture.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:09.400
If other men will not lay down
their right as well as you,

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.140
there is no reason for you to
divest yourself of this.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:19.180
For to do that would be to
expose yourself to prey,

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.770
"which no man is bound to,"
rather than to dispose

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.830
yourself to peace.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:30.140
That is the first law of nature
says: Look, without

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:36.180
cooperation, without peace,
life is miserable; it's

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:40.110
solitary, nasty, brutish,
and short--

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.930
so self-interest demands that
you seek peace if you can.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:48.750
The second law of nature tells
you: you should seek peace

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.750
insofar as others are
willing to do so.

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:56.240
But the problem that we will
address in the form of the

00:42:56.240 --> 00:43:02.340
prisoner's dilemma is that
without some sort of central

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:09.310
coordination, it will always be
rational for everybody to

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:13.920
drop out of the cooperative
situation.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:18.250
And it's in light of
that Hobbes gives

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.070
voice to his solution.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:25.210
The third law of nature
according to Hobbes is that

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:28.860
you need to perform
your covenants.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:33.890
That is, you need to do what
you have promised.

00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:37.770
And in order for you to do that,
you need to have the

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:41.780
guarantee that others will
also do as they promise.

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.160
Covenants, he says, are invalid
if you fear that the

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.960
other party may renege.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:51.010
So to have covenants, there
must be enforcement.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:56.160
In particular, says Hobbes,
there needs to be some sort of

00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:01.060
coercive power that will compel
men equally to the

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:06.040
performance of their covenants,
by the terror of--

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.770
I told you punishment
was coming back--

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:13.820
some punishment greater than the
benefit they expect by the

00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:17.360
breach of their covenant.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:22.700
So Hobbes' solution is the
following: He says men

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:25.500
naturally love liberty and
dominion over others, they

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.100
recognize that the cost of
this is the miserable

00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:29.590
condition of war.

00:44:29.590 --> 00:44:32.330
The only means of getting
themselves out of this is

00:44:32.330 --> 00:44:37.510
through the introduction of a
restraint among themselves in

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:40.430
the form of a commonwealth.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:48.720
And because we are unlike ants
and bees, cooperation can't be

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.530
achieved without this
external constraint.

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:59.500
Conclusion, says Hobbes, is
that each of us must say,

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:04.490
hypothetically and voluntarily,
"I authorize and

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:09.850
give up my right of governing
myself to this man or to this

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:14.490
assembly of men on this
condition that thou give up

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:20.310
thy right to him and authorize
his actions in like manner."

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:27.330
That is, says Hobbes, it is
only when individuals form

00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:34.710
themselves into a society
whereby in return for giving

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:38.700
up freedom, commodious
living is possible.

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:44.450
It's only then that most of
the things that we take as

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:50.000
definitive of human society
and human experience even

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.420
become possible.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:58.620
What we'll look at next lecture
is a schema for

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:02.230
thinking about the dilemma that
Hobbes thinks we find

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:07.750
ourselves in, and ask whether
Hobbes' solution, the

00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:13.120
imposition of an external
sovereign, is indeed the only

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:18.450
solution to the puzzle which he
poses to us in the form all

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:21.400
his argument about the state
of nature, the first and

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.000
second laws of nature,
and finally the

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.510
third law of nature.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:27.780
So I'll see everyone
on Thursday.

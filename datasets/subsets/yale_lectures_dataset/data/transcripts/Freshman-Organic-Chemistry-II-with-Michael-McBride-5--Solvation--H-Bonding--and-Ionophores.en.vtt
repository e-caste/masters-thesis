00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.333
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK. So as we
move from 

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:06.467
radical to ionic reactions,
HOMO-LUMO 

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:10.533
reactions, we have to take into
account solvation. 

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.300
So they will do that, and
H-bonding, talk about 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.933
ionophores and Bronsted acidity.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.000
We might begin nucleophilic
substitution. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.767
First, the answer to that puzzle
that we had for 

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.767
homework last time, the question
is how you get to the 

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.333
aldehyde from the alcohol-- 

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:31.500
by free-radical chain
substitution reaction. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.467
And do you remember that you
would substitute the hydrogen 

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.500
with the chlorine, you know how
to do that. 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.100
And then if you have a base
around it-- it doesn't have to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.400
be a strong base-- 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.733
you can pull off the proton and
lose the chlorine-- 

00:00:43.733 --> 00:00:48.300
chloride simultaneously in an
elimination reaction to 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.900
generate the carbonyl, and I
think a lot 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.133
of people got that. 

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.367
And notice that those things
happen at the same time. 

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:59.233
That the departure of the
chloride opens up a LUMO that 

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.767
helps take the electrons from
the O-H bond. 

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.300
So the O-H bond is weakened by
the fact of 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.333
the chloride leaving. 

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:08.300
So all those things are
happening at once. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.367
And we'll talk more when we get
to elimination reactions 

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:15.467
about the timing of that
process. 

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:18.100
So the base that removes the
proton could 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.233
be a very weak base. 

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.833
It could be just the unshared
pair of an alcohol or even of 

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:27.033
a bisulfate anion. 

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:30.567
Now that might not be the way it
actually happens in 30% 

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:31.967
sulfuric acid. 

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:34.167
So I asked you think of another
mechanism, one 

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:36.467
involving HOMO-LUMO
substitution. 

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:39.700
So the question is what's the
HOMO and what's the LUMO. 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.333
So the HOMO's an unshared pair
on the alcohol, and the LUMO 

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.867
is the sigma* of the
nitrogen-chlorine bond, which 

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:48.767
is especially low because of the
positive 

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:51.033
charge on the nitrogen. 

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.867
So we can do a substitution
reaction. 

00:01:54.867 --> 00:02:02.333
And this will then put the
chlorine on to the alcohol. 

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:04.900
The positive charge you're going
to get rid of, which you 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.967
can just do by the amine that
was generated in the same 

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:12.100
process, it can take off the
proton, which you notice is a 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.200
substitution reaction at
hydrogen substituting nitrogen 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.233
in place of oxygen on the
hydrogen. 

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:25.233
So then we have the same
compound as above, except the 

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:28.867
hydrogen and the chlorine are
exchanged in their position. 

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:31.633
So you can do the same thing
again-- bring in a base, pull 

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:34.433
off the proton and lose the
chloride. 

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:38.400
Now you don't usually think of
bases taking protons off from 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.933
normal carbon atoms. But this
isn't a normal carbon atom 

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.733
because the chloride's leaving.

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:47.567
So there's something that can
take the electrons as the base 

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:48.967
pulls the proton off. 

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.933
So the same kind of elimination,
just backwards, 

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.167
gives the same product. 

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.833
So that was the mechanisms that
I was hoping you might be 

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:58.067
able to see. 

00:02:58.067 --> 00:03:01.833
So in the last lecture we were
talking about what holds 

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:06.200
molecules together other than
bonding, about non-bonded 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.533
interactions. 

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.600
Those are visible in the
physical properties of the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.667
alkyl halides in the boiling
point. 

00:03:12.667 --> 00:03:13.900
And alkanes too-- 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.633
any liquid for that matter. 

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:19.567
So we looked last time and saw
that the dipole-dipole 

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:23.767
interaction could hold alkyl
halides together. 

00:03:23.767 --> 00:03:27.833
But that can't be all it is,
because that gets large and 

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.733
then gets small again, and the
boiling points keep going up 

00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:31.333
all the time. 

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:34.033
So there must be something else,
and that something else 

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:35.800
is polarizability-- 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.333
the fact that if you have a lot
of electrons and they're 

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:43.367
far out in high-n orbitals so
that they're easily sloshed 

00:03:43.367 --> 00:03:47.967
around, that is, it's
polarizable, then you can have 

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:51.233
interactions between the dipole
and something that gets 

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:54.600
polarized by the dipole, or
indeed between two 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.300
instantaneous dipoles. 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.900
And we see that iodide here is
much more 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.167
polarizable than fluoride. 

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:06.833
So that's the other mechanism
that's holding 

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:09.233
the molecules together. 

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:13.800
That is, between molecules, the
bonding between molecules, 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.133
the non-bonded interactions. 

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.800
Then we said last time let's
look at hydrocarbons and see 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:24.267
what they tell us at butane and
isobutane, neopentane, and 

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.600
n-pentane (normal pentane). 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.833
So here are the boiling points
for n-butane and isobutane. 

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:34.167
And you see that as you make it
more branched, it's an 

00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:40.433
isomer, the same atoms. But as
you make it more branched, the 

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:42.567
boiling point goes down. 

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:45.100
It's easier to pull the
molecules apart to make them 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.333
in the gas phase. 

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.500
The same thing is true of
pentane. 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.167
Normal pentane you go down eight

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:52.100
degrees to get to isopentane. 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.567
And neopentane goes down by
another 18 degrees. 

00:04:57.567 --> 00:05:03.000
So polarizability does its job
well only when things are 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.633
close together. 

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:09.233
Remember its 1/R^N dependence,
so it falls off rapidly, the 

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:10.967
energy you can get from this. 

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:17.067
So if you have the same atoms,
for example, here in normal 

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:21.333
pentane, so we got five in a
row, we have to get the atoms 

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:24.600
close together to allow their
polarizability to hold the 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.933
molecules together. 

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.700
So with these you can put them
side by side, and that's 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.800
great, and all the atoms in one
molecule are near all the 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.100
atoms in another molecule. 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.333
But if it's a branched compound
like neopentane here 

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:44.333
where the four methyl groups are
on the same atom, then you 

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:50.633
can't get them nearly as close
to one another for purposes of 

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:53.967
having the polarizability do the
trick. 

00:05:53.967 --> 00:05:56.767
We have a picture here so that
you can see it better on the 

00:05:56.767 --> 00:05:58.767
next slide. 

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.933
So it's atoms that are near the
surface of the molecule 

00:06:01.933 --> 00:06:02.600
that count. 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.900
Atoms that are deep down inside
of molecule don't get 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.067
close enough to their neighbors
to profit 

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:09.533
from this very much. 

00:06:09.533 --> 00:06:15.367
So there's above n-pentane and
below neopentane, and here you 

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.533
can see how much closer you can
get the molecules. 

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.533
And if you'd like to see whether
you can get them 

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:22.267
closer than I suggested in
holding here, I'll pass these 

00:06:22.267 --> 00:06:25.300
around and you can hold them and
have a good time. 

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:34.800
Now you can see something a
little bit like that in the 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.133
heat of formation, the stability
of the molecules. 

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:41.500
Notice that the heat of
formation of neopentane is 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.533
larger, more negative, more
downhill to form neopentane 

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:46.800
than to form n-pentane. 

00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:54.133
Part of that must be the same
reason that the polarizability 

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.500
could operate within a molecule
as 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.467
well as between molecules. 

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:01.933
And when you get all the atoms
not to be spread out but to be 

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:05.867
more in a ball, then the atoms
within the molecule are near 

00:07:05.867 --> 00:07:06.833
one another. 

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:11.033
So what you lose in terms of
polarizability from one 

00:07:11.033 --> 00:07:15.433
molecule being adjacent to
another one, you gain in 

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:17.733
interactions within the
molecule. 

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:20.567
So that's not the only reason
for this, but that's one 

00:07:20.567 --> 00:07:25.733
reason that branching makes
molecules more stable. 

00:07:25.733 --> 00:07:30.867
So it's like solvation, except
it happens within the molecule 

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.167
rather than between molecules. 

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:37.133
And you can see the same
principle in a more pronounced 

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:41.533
way when there's an actual
charge to do the polarizing. 

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:45.200
So if we look here at the gas
phase ionic disassociations, 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.300
so how much energy does it take
to break a chloride away 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.533
from R to make R+. 

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.400
So we look at the stability then
of the R+ cation, and 

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.133
you can see that it's ever so
much easier-- 

00:07:57.133 --> 00:08:01.533
53 kilocalories easier to make
t-butyl than 

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:03.100
it is to make methyl. 

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.200
Now there are a number of
factors that are involved 

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.833
there and we're going to discuss
others as well. 

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:10.533
But one of the factors is
certainly that the positive 

00:08:10.533 --> 00:08:14.967
charge gains stability by
polarizing the material 

00:08:14.967 --> 00:08:15.967
that's around it. 

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.933
And the more material you have
around it, the closer to the 

00:08:18.933 --> 00:08:21.767
positive charge, the more
stability you're going to get. 

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:24.333
So that's one of the factors
that's involved here. 

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:27.733
It's not the only factor, but
this intramolecular 

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:28.667
solvation-- 

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:31.433
I mean that's sort of a stupid
thing to say-- 

00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:33.967
but that must be one of the
factors that helps explain 

00:08:33.967 --> 00:08:36.467
these trends. 

00:08:36.467 --> 00:08:38.700
Now here we look at the boiling
points of the normal 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.500
alkanes with different chain
lengths, and 

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.800
halogen on the end. 

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.100
Or in the first case, hydrogen.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.733
So, here n-alkanes has hydrogen
on the end of the 

00:08:50.733 --> 00:08:54.333
chain, then fluoride, chloride,
bromide, iodine. 

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:59.467
This is a picture from the
textbook, the Jones textbook, 

00:08:59.467 --> 00:09:02.067
and here we see them colored so
you can 

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:04.067
see what atom's involved. 

00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:07.767
So one would infer from this
that for some reason-- 

00:09:07.767 --> 00:09:11.867
I mean just the impression it
makes on me as a viewer is 

00:09:11.867 --> 00:09:16.500
that something suggests that the
iodides are low boiling. 

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.100
You see what I'm saying? 

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.000
That curve falls below the
others. 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.100
But what does molecular weight
have to do with boiling point? 

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.767
Notice what's being plotted here
is molecular weight 

00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:31.300
against boiling point. 

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.967
But what relevance does
molecular weight have to 

00:09:33.967 --> 00:09:35.467
boiling point? 

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:38.933
There's sort of an intuitive
idea that if something's heavy 

00:09:38.933 --> 00:09:42.533
it's hard to get up in the gas
phase. 

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:45.900
But that has nothing to do with
boiling point. 

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:48.300
That's pure nonsense. 

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.100
The question is is there a
better way to plot this to see 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.800
what's going on? 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.667
And I think there is, which is
instead of plot it against the 

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:00.733
molecular weight, plot against
the length of the chain-- 

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:02.433
how big is the molecule. 

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:07.367
So if we do that, so we plot n
here in H, CH2 taken n times, 

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:10.933
and then X. And now we'll change
X from hydrogen the 

00:10:10.933 --> 00:10:14.367
fluorine to chlorine to bromine
to iodine. 

00:10:14.367 --> 00:10:18.833
Now fluorine is almost the same
as hydrogen. 

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.633
When it's a really short chain,
the fluoride is a 

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:24.300
little bit like-- that's methyl
fluoride-- 

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.200
that's higher boiling than
hydrogen. 

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.433
We already explained that-- the
dipoles that are in the 

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:34.067
CH3F can interact with one
another in a favorable way. 

00:10:34.067 --> 00:10:37.367
But once you get a real long
chain, that's not a very big 

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:40.933
fraction of the total and it
comes to look pretty much like 

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:41.733
the alkanes. 

00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:44.767
But now look what happens if you
go-- 

00:10:44.767 --> 00:10:48.167
so the dipole moment is bigger
for fluoride than it is for 

00:10:48.167 --> 00:10:49.333
the hydrogen. 

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:53.633
But the polarizabilities are
about the same. 

00:10:53.633 --> 00:10:56.500
But chloride is more
polarizable-- 

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.533
it has more electrons further
out. 

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:02.933
So although it has essentially
the same dipole moment as the 

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:07.000
fluoride, its polarizability,
its greater polarizability is 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.833
clearly holding things together.

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:11.433
And the same thing is true when
you go on to bromide, 

00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:13.267
which is still more polarizable.

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:16.733
And to iodide, which is the most
polarizable of all. 

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:21.233
So in a sort of back hand way
it's related to molecular 

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:23.800
weight, because the more
electrons you have in the 

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.067
atom, the further out they are,
the more they slosh 

00:11:26.067 --> 00:11:28.200
around, the more polarizable
they are. 

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.400
But the electrons have nothing
to do with the weight. 

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.700
It's the nucleus that has to do
with the weight. 

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.033
But more electrons mean more
neutrons and more protons in 

00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:36.833
the nucleus. 

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:39.967
So it's sort of parallel, but I
think it's more informative 

00:11:39.967 --> 00:11:42.300
to look at it this way to see
what it is that's really 

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.833
holding the molecules together.

00:11:45.833 --> 00:11:50.433
Now you've heard the ancients
say "like dissolves like." And 

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:55.933
you've seen things like soup
that has globs of the fat 

00:11:55.933 --> 00:12:00.633
floating around and obviously
not mixing with water. 

00:12:00.633 --> 00:12:03.933
And you've heard tell of
solvophobic forces, probably 

00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:06.433
hydrophobic forces. 

00:12:06.433 --> 00:12:12.100
So the name implies an
antagonism between water and 

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.233
the alkane, the grease, that
tends to push them apart. 

00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:19.933
So you get islands of grease in
a matrix of water. 

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:26.200
Now here're droplets of mercury
on a 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.133
cover slip, on glass. 

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:30.700
And you can see that the mercury
beads up-- it doesn't 

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.800
spread out and wet the glass. 

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.633
So it seems that mercury doesn't
wet glass. 

00:12:36.633 --> 00:12:41.033
So there seems to be a phobic
force between glass and 

00:12:41.033 --> 00:12:43.733
mercury that tends to push them
apart to keep them 

00:12:43.733 --> 00:12:45.500
separate from one another. 

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:50.600
Here we see droplets of mercury
in a polyethylene 

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.467
container, and you can see that
it beads up-- that 

00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:55.867
mercury doesn't wet hydrocarbon
either. 

00:12:55.867 --> 00:13:00.533
So it looks like they are
antagonistic to one another. 

00:13:00.533 --> 00:13:02.000
The same thing is true of water.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.500
Water doesn't wet a waxed car or
a hydrocarbon. 

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.033
That's hydrophobic forces-- 

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:13.500
that's like the grease, they
stay apart. 

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.667
Now, if that's so, can you tell
me should 

00:13:16.667 --> 00:13:20.400
mercury repel water? 

00:13:25.733 --> 00:13:29.367
So if we touch a drop of water
to a drop of mercury, should 

00:13:29.367 --> 00:13:32.300
they stay apart as beads or
should they 

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.600
spread on each other? 

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:43.500
How many think they should be
antagonistic and form beads? 

00:13:46.267 --> 00:13:50.267
How many think they should
spread on one another? 

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:53.833
Well, there's a slight excess
there, but pretty close to a 

00:13:53.833 --> 00:13:55.267
tie, and I think there are a
number of 

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:57.700
individuals not voting. 

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.500
So we can do the experiment. 

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.867
See how the water comes over and
grabs on to the mercury? 

00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:09.067
So clearly there's affinity
between mercury and water. 

00:14:09.067 --> 00:14:12.833
But, in fact, there's also
affinity between mercury and 

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:19.867
glass, and there's affinity
between alkane and water. 

00:14:19.867 --> 00:14:23.667
It's a misleading term to say
"phobic" that these things are 

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:25.800
avoiding one another. 

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.833
Clearly, mercury attracts water.

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:33.400
But alkanes and water or mercury
and glass don't repel 

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.600
one another. 

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.133
There's attraction between them
as you expect. 

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:42.400
If nothing else there will be
the mutual polarization of one 

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.000
atom by another across this
boundary that will tend to 

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.133
hold things together. 

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:50.433
But mercury is particularly
good. 

00:14:50.433 --> 00:14:52.733
It has so many electrons out
there that could be 

00:14:52.733 --> 00:14:53.800
polarizable. 

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.467
Mercury holds to mercury very,
very tightly. 

00:14:57.467 --> 00:15:02.600
And water likes to be near water
for hydrogen bonding, 

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.733
which is what we're going to
talk about. 

00:15:03.733 --> 00:15:06.733
Water likes to be near mercury,
but not as much as 

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:10.367
mercury likes to be near
mercury. 

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:13.533
So water with mercury is a good
interaction from the 

00:15:13.533 --> 00:15:14.933
point of view of the water. 

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:17.767
The water is a dipole, the
mercury is polarizable, 

00:15:17.767 --> 00:15:20.167
there's good attraction there. 

00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:22.467
But mercury doesn't want to
change its shape. 

00:15:22.467 --> 00:15:25.433
It wants to have as many mercury
atoms as close 

00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:26.933
together as possible. 

00:15:26.933 --> 00:15:30.467
It's like the alkane, the
neopentane-- 

00:15:30.467 --> 00:15:32.233
the atoms want to be close to
one another 

00:15:32.233 --> 00:15:33.600
to be low in energy. 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.133
So you don't want to distort
mercury because it has so much 

00:15:37.133 --> 00:15:41.400
attraction between the atoms.
But water attracts mercury 

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.400
better than it attracts itself.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.867
So it spreads out on the
mercury. 

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:50.067
So these solvophobic forces are
not really a question of 

00:15:50.067 --> 00:15:53.500
things being antagonistic to one
another. 

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.267
It's a question of something
really wanting to be close to 

00:15:56.267 --> 00:15:58.500
itself for some particular
reason. 

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.867
Mercury with mercury is very
good attraction. 

00:16:01.867 --> 00:16:04.100
But water with water, too. 

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.100
Water will attract grease. 

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.233
But it attracts itself much
better. 

00:16:11.233 --> 00:16:13.233
So it wants to stay connected to
itself. 

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.333
This brings up the question of
what is it that 

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:19.900
holds water to itself. 

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.367
And, of course, we heard last
time about hydrogen bonding. 

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:25.400
So let's think about hydrogen
bonding. 

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.400
So water has a dipole. 

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.833
So you can imagine that two of
them would line up this way-- 

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:33.500
positive to negative, the
dipoles. 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:38.033
But actually, this is the
calculated dimer structure for 

00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:40.400
water, calculated in 2000. 

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.000
Water gets worked on so much and
it's 

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.233
been worked on forever. 

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:47.167
‘Anybody that has a theoretical
technique tries 

00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:48.167
to do it with water. 

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:51.467
And the main thing is that
although they hold together, 

00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:53.433
they don't hold together very
strongly. 

00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:55.633
The dimerization energy's only
about three 

00:16:55.633 --> 00:16:58.100
kilocalories per mole. 

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.767
And there's a lot of flexibility
in it because it's 

00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:02.633
rather weak. 

00:17:02.633 --> 00:17:05.400
But the very lowest energy,
according to this particular 

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.333
calculation, is this one. 

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:11.733
Now there's a hydrogen between
the two oxygens-- 

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.667
the hydrogen of one of the
molecules is 

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.033
between the two oxygens. 

00:17:15.033 --> 00:17:17.133
But let's look at the bond
distances. 

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:24.567
There's 95 picometers, that's
0.95 Å': same over here 

00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:25.667
on the left. 

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:29.933
But the bridging one is 0.9639,
0.96. 

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:34.333
Well, it's longer, but it's not
much longer. 

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:38.800
So it's lengthened by only 0.5%.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.533
So there's not much electron
pair from one oxygen donating 

00:17:44.533 --> 00:17:46.767
into sigma* of the other one--
that's what you would 

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:49.600
expect for a bond. 

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.967
It hasn't lengthened the bond to
the hydrogen. 

00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:58.967
Now, how would you expect the
waters to line up according to 

00:17:58.967 --> 00:18:01.933
their-- we looked at the charge
last time, the dipole, 

00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:04.767
but water isn't just a positive
charge here and a 

00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:06.200
negative charge here at a
certain 

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.467
distance from one another. 

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:10.200
The electrons are spread all out
with different densities. 

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.033
So you can analyze it as
multipoles, not only a dipole 

00:18:14.033 --> 00:18:17.867
moment, but also a quadrupole
moment, which is plus plus 

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:21.900
minus minus, and an octupole,
and a hexadecapole moment. 

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.600
This is hard to do in your head.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.600
But one thing you can do with
Spartan or other graphic 

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.333
programs is draw this
electrostatic surface 

00:18:32.333 --> 00:18:34.867
potential that we've talked
about to see where on the 

00:18:34.867 --> 00:18:37.300
surface a proton would be happy.

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.333
That's where it's red, or
unhappy where it's blue. 

00:18:40.333 --> 00:18:45.433
And the energies are -47, very
favorable in the blue area, to 

00:18:45.433 --> 00:18:48.167
+60, very unfavorable in the red
area for a 

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.800
proton at the surface. 

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.133
Now let's look at the one on the
right there and let's 

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:58.367
rotate it so we sight right
along the H-O bond. 

00:18:58.367 --> 00:19:02.400
And if we look we see that it's
blue there-- a bad place 

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.267
to put a proton, a good place to
put something negative. 

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:11.300
And the color scale here goes
instead of -47 to 60, well 

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.800
this is -45 to 60. 

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.633
But we can home in on it to get
the colors to show what we 

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:21.000
want by going +55 to +60. 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.900
Now you see that there's a very
small region there which 

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.700
is the best place to put
something negative, the worst 

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.033
place to put something positive.

00:19:32.033 --> 00:19:35.900
And if we look at it we see that
as you move the proton up 

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.233
and down there or back and
forth, you change by half a 

00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:42.667
kilocalorie per mole if you go
up and down by half an 

00:19:42.667 --> 00:19:46.167
angstrom, which would correspond
then if you went up 

00:19:46.167 --> 00:19:48.733
there-- that's where we're
looking at on the surface. 

00:19:48.733 --> 00:19:53.700
So that's plus or minus 9
degrees up and down. 

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.833
So that's a fairly tiny target,
although it doesn't-- 

00:19:57.833 --> 00:19:59.833
half a kilocalorie isn't
enormous. 

00:19:59.833 --> 00:20:02.933
You could go further and not
lose too much. 

00:20:02.933 --> 00:20:04.833
But look at the oxygen end. 

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:08.600
If we rotate that one and look
at the water from the oxygen 

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:13.733
end, we see there's a very big
streak of red. 

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:21.600
That's 10 kilocalories total
range on the color scale. 

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:28.067
If we go here down to 5, which
is the same scale being used 

00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:29.833
over here, it's way spread out.

00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:33.833
And even if we go further to
only one and a half 

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:43.467
kilocalories per mole, for the
entire color scale you can see 

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:47.667
that that red range goes quite
far up and down, 1.38 

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:50.433
Å', plus or minus 25 degrees. 

00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:52.900
And the energy change is only
0.05. 

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.467
So it's very big red target that
you can tolerate. 

00:20:56.467 --> 00:20:58.933
So you have a tall target there
and a small target on 

00:20:58.933 --> 00:21:00.767
the other one. 

00:21:00.767 --> 00:21:03.467
Now when you put them together
this way you see you can bend 

00:21:03.467 --> 00:21:06.267
these down and get these
hydrogens far away from that 

00:21:06.267 --> 00:21:12.000
one and still have very good
contact between the places 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.233
that complementary charges are
good to sit. 

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:20.167
That's a very qualitative sort
of analysis of this, but it's 

00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:23.867
a sort of funny minimum energy
structure for water. 

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:29.067
But the important thing is that
it's consistent with just 

00:21:29.067 --> 00:21:32.900
how the charges of isolated
waters would interact with one 

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.233
another, just charge-charge
interaction. 

00:21:35.233 --> 00:21:36.733
There's no special bonding. 

00:21:36.733 --> 00:21:39.233
Quantum mechanics didn't come
into this. 

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:41.367
Once you have the water
molecules you'd bring them 

00:21:41.367 --> 00:21:43.067
together and that's a reasonable

00:21:43.067 --> 00:21:45.433
way for them to fit. 

00:21:45.433 --> 00:21:48.600
The disassociation energy is not
large. It's 3.3 

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.067
kilocalories per mole, but you
can get other 

00:21:51.067 --> 00:21:52.433
waters around and about. 

00:21:52.433 --> 00:22:00.367
So taking a water molecule into
the gas phase out of 

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:05.067
water is much more, of course,
than 3 kilocalories per mole. 

00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:09.633
So from this perspective what
makes hydrogen bonding 

00:22:09.633 --> 00:22:13.500
important is that you have these
dipoles, but they can 

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.233
get very close to one another,
because remember the energy 

00:22:16.233 --> 00:22:18.667
falls off very rapidly with
distance. 

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:22.433
Because hydrogen is so small it
can get very close to the 

00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:24.533
oxygen end of a dipole. 

00:22:24.533 --> 00:22:27.200
So it's just dipole-dipole
interaction like you have in 

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.733
any of these other things we
were looking at, but they can 

00:22:29.733 --> 00:22:31.500
get really, really close to one
another. 

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:35.300
So you get more energy in the
case of hydrogen bonds than 

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.433
you do for other dipoles. 

00:22:38.433 --> 00:22:40.133
So nothing special. 

00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:42.167
There's no real bonding to it. 

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:45.533
It's just that the molecules can
come together and be low 

00:22:45.533 --> 00:22:47.367
in energy that way. 

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:51.700
Typically, the hydrogen bonding
is less than 5%, often 

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.867
much less than 5% as strong as a
covalent bond. 

00:22:54.867 --> 00:22:57.567
So a hydrogen bond isn't
anything like the bonds we 

00:22:57.567 --> 00:22:59.600
talked about last semester. 

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.133
Or is it? 

00:23:02.133 --> 00:23:04.900
A hydrogen bonding can be
subtle. 

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:08.000
And it's the subject of
continuing investigation. 

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.033
There's a Professor Johnson, a
physical chemist in our 

00:23:13.033 --> 00:23:14.800
department, is doing a lot of
work on the 

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:16.067
structure of water. 

00:23:16.067 --> 00:23:18.500
And Professor Jorgensen, a
theoretician, has done a lot 

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.533
of work on water as well. 

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:25.967
So if you have ions involved, so
not neutral waters coming 

00:23:25.967 --> 00:23:29.433
together, but the protonated
water coming together with the 

00:23:29.433 --> 00:23:32.767
water, then the question is what
kind of hydrogen bonding 

00:23:32.767 --> 00:23:36.067
are you going to get in this
case? 

00:23:36.067 --> 00:23:39.400
Now the heat involved in those
things coming together, 

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.800
instead of 3.3 kilocalories per
mole is 10 times greater. 

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.100
32 kilocalories per mole. 

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.000
But, of course, there's an
entropy price to pay when you 

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.633
pull these things together. 

00:23:50.633 --> 00:23:53.967
So the actual free energy change
in bringing them 

00:23:53.967 --> 00:23:56.633
together isn't nearly as
favorable because you're 

00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:59.833
localized in things that were
free to move around before. 

00:23:59.833 --> 00:24:03.700
So the free energy change at 300
kelvin is 8 kilocalories 

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.433
per mole in the gas phase. 

00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:08.900
But here's what's interesting. 

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:14.200
There's the structure of this
H5O2+'. 

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.333
What do you notice about it as
compared to the water dimer? 

00:24:22.067 --> 00:24:24.433
STUDENT: I think it's bonded. 

00:24:24.433 --> 00:24:25.933
PROFESSOR: Why do you think so,
Lauren? 

00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.467
Why do you think it's bonded? 

00:24:27.467 --> 00:24:30.400
STUDENT: Because the lines are
going both ways. 

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:32.367
It looks like it's sitting right
in the middle of it. 

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:32.667
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:24:32.667 --> 00:24:34.200
The hydrogen is right in the
middle. 

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.433
It's not like the other one
where the hydrogen was a 

00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:39.000
normal bond distance from one
oxygen and quite far 

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:39.933
from the other one. 

00:24:39.933 --> 00:24:40.833
It's right in the middle. 

00:24:40.833 --> 00:24:44.067
And in fact, if you do a
calculation of how much energy 

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:48.033
it takes to move that hydrogen
back and forth, you see that 

00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:49.967
it's a single minimum. 

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:53.133
Not a double minimum where it
could be part of the time on 

00:24:53.133 --> 00:24:55.833
one, part of the time on the
other and jump back and forth. 

00:24:55.833 --> 00:24:57.100
It's a single minimum. 

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.167
The H+ is equally shared. 

00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:02.467
So this case is real bonding. 

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:04.467
A single minimum in the middle.

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:08.533
Now, how about if we do the
anion example-- 

00:25:08.533 --> 00:25:13.300
H3O2-‘, hydroxide being hydrogen
bonded by water. 

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.267
So what's the answer there? 

00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:19.967
We know that the energy involved
is rather similar to 

00:25:19.967 --> 00:25:22.633
what it is for the H5O2-- 

00:25:22.633 --> 00:25:27.500
it's 27 kilocalories per mole in
the gas phase. 

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:33.867
But the structure is rather
different, or is it? 

00:25:33.867 --> 00:25:37.800
Is the hydrogen halfway in
between? 

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.367
What do you notice about this
one compared to the cation? 

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.733
It a double minimum now, not a
single minimum. 

00:25:48.733 --> 00:25:50.967
So it's lower in energy when the
hydrogen is on 

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:52.667
one end or the other. 

00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:56.700
And a maximum, local maximum, in
the middle. 

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:01.700
However, hydrogen is very light.

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.400
What does that have to do it? 

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.667
Go back to the beginning of last
semester. 

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:08.533
STUDENT: Tunneling? 

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:08.800
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:10.300
STUDENT: Tunneling? 

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.400
PROFESSOR: Tunneling. 

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:15.500
If you look at the very lowest
energy level for moving the 

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.167
hydrogen back and forth, you'll
see something 

00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:19.600
interesting. 

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.433
So this is a double minimum. 

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:23.133
The hydrogen is not 

00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:25.467
symmetrically bound along this.

00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:27.200
But it can't have the minimum
energy. 

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.067
And the barrier is very low,
only 0.6 

00:26:30.067 --> 00:26:32.000
kilocalories per mole. 

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.867
So if you look at the lowest-
energy vibrational wave 

00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:38.067
function, it looks like that. 

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:42.300
So even though it's a double
minimum, the hydrogen spends 

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:46.133
most of its time in the middle.

00:26:46.133 --> 00:26:49.500
And, of course, the reason it
can do that is that-- 

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.433
the reason it can spend most of
its time in the middle is 

00:26:52.433 --> 00:26:55.267
because there is some bonding
that lowers its energy there. 

00:26:55.267 --> 00:26:58.633
So there can be hydrogen
bonding. 

00:26:58.633 --> 00:27:01.967
We saw it in H3O+ plus water. 

00:27:01.967 --> 00:27:04.100
We see it in hydroxide plus
water. 

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.233
Even though it's a double
minimum in potential energy, 

00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:08.800
the thing can be in the middle.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.033
So there is real bonding there.

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:13.967
And in fact, in pure water
without ions, if you have high 

00:27:13.967 --> 00:27:17.033
pressure that forces the waters
closer together, so the 

00:27:17.033 --> 00:27:19.033
better part of a million
atmospheres-- 

00:27:19.033 --> 00:27:21.667
and this can be done in a
laboratory-- 

00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:24.967
the oxygens get closer together
and closer together. 

00:27:24.967 --> 00:27:28.333
What was a double minimum
becomes a single minimum. 

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:33.067
And the structure of this Form
10 of ice-- 

00:27:33.067 --> 00:27:36.833
water is nothing if not
versatile. 

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:39.533
There are more than 10 different
structures of ice 

00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:40.867
that have been observed. 

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:43.767
But this particular high
pressure one, as you can see 

00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:47.700
from the structure, has
hydrogens halfway between. 

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.000
So it's no longer molecular
water. 

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.567
It's an entire crystal-- the
whole thing is one molecule 

00:27:53.567 --> 00:27:55.933
with hydrogen bonds holding it
together. 

00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:58.767
But this is not what we usually
are talking about in 

00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:00.433
terms of hydrogen bonds. 

00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:03.867
Normal hydrogen bonds are just
this polar interaction which 

00:28:03.867 --> 00:28:06.300
are favorable because hydrogen's
so small and can 

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.800
get close to other things. 

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:15.067
Now we're going to go on from
this digression about water to 

00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:18.567
talk about crown ethers, and
what are called tailored 

00:28:18.567 --> 00:28:20.233
ionophores. 

00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:24.433
So here's a crown ether. 

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:29.400
You have to be imaginative to
see that as a crown. 

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.133
But you can sort of imagine
putting it on your head and 

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:34.467
have all the little things go up
and around, and I suppose 

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:36.233
that's where the name came from.

00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:39.067
So this idea of having an oxygen
and then a bridge of 

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:41.033
two carbons and another oxygen
and a bridge, 

00:28:41.033 --> 00:28:42.733
oxygen, bridge in a ring. 

00:28:42.733 --> 00:28:43.767
Those are the crowns. 

00:28:43.767 --> 00:28:47.067
So they have a name, this is
18-crown-6. 

00:28:47.067 --> 00:28:50.567
So it's a crown alternating
oxygen and two carbons, oxygen 

00:28:50.567 --> 00:28:52.767
and two carbons. 

00:28:52.767 --> 00:28:55.467
And it's six because there are
six oxygens in it. 

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:59.333
And this was one of the earliest
ones studied. 

00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:03.700
And in fact, these crown ethers
resulted in the Nobel 

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.400
Prize in Chemistry for the
people who discovered and 

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.167
exploited them in 1987. 

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:13.100
Ionophore means an ion carrier--

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.067
the Greek root phorous means to
carry things. 

00:29:16.067 --> 00:29:18.600
So these things are able to
carry ions-- 

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.567
let's see how that works. 

00:29:20.567 --> 00:29:24.867
So here's 18-crown-6 viewed from
the top and from the side 

00:29:24.867 --> 00:29:27.100
with potassium chloride. 

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.367
And you see the potassium is
held inside. 

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:32.600
I'll pass this around so you can
see it. 

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.600
Here's the ring of 6 oxygens
connected by 

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.767
pairs of CH2 groups. 

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:45.167
It turned out that a golf ball
is about the right scale to 

00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:48.000
have the radius of a potassium
ion on the 

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.600
scale of these models. 

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.633
And you see it fits right in the
middle. 

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:56.467
If we look at the 6 oxygens,
they're not all in a plane, as 

00:29:56.467 --> 00:29:57.700
you can see there. 

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:01.567
There are three of them up and
three of them down. 

00:30:01.567 --> 00:30:02.833
Does that remind you of
anything? 

00:30:05.667 --> 00:30:05.933
Megan? 

00:30:05.933 --> 00:30:06.733
STUDENT: Cyclohexane. 

00:30:06.733 --> 00:30:08.167
PROFESSOR: Just like
cyclohexane-- 

00:30:08.167 --> 00:30:10.067
it goes up down, up down, up
down, the chair cyclohexane. 

00:30:13.333 --> 00:30:17.233
And the potassium sits right in
the middle with three above 

00:30:17.233 --> 00:30:21.300
and three below, and I'll pass
that around so you can see it. 

00:30:23.833 --> 00:30:26.967
So potassium is just the right
size to fit in there-- fits 

00:30:26.967 --> 00:30:28.800
right in the middle. 

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:32.667
If we look at the actual
distances that are involved 

00:30:32.667 --> 00:30:38.500
you can see these distances are
all about 2.8 Å', 

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:44.733
which is just about exactly the
sum of the ionic radii of 

00:30:44.733 --> 00:30:47.267
potassium and the covalent
radius of oxygen-- 

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:49.067
2.7 that would be. 

00:30:49.067 --> 00:30:51.567
Those numbers aren't really such
great numbers, so that it 

00:30:51.567 --> 00:30:54.733
really fits right. 

00:30:54.733 --> 00:30:58.100
Now what if you use a bigger ion
like cesium? 

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:03.633
So cesium is 1.7 Å', so now 3.1
instead of 2.7 for the 

00:31:03.633 --> 00:31:07.133
oxygen-cesium distance. 

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:10.067
Now you can see that because
cesium's larger it can't get 

00:31:10.067 --> 00:31:13.800
in the middle; it sits on top
close to three of the oxygens, 

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.433
and further from the bottom
three oxygens. 

00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:17.867
There's the view from the back.

00:31:20.633 --> 00:31:23.333
Now here's the skeleton with the
balls for 

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:24.700
the atoms of that. 

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.567
And you can see that the closer
oxygens are at van der 

00:31:27.567 --> 00:31:32.567
Waals distance, 3.1 Å'. But the
others are closer to 

00:31:32.567 --> 00:31:37.800
3.2 or 3.3 Å'. 

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:43.467
Now that distance is 4.8 Å'.
What happens if you 

00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:45.733
would make an even smaller ion
in the middle? 

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:54.300
You could try to shrink the ring
down. 

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:57.800
But if you pull those two closer
together in order to 

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:01.100
make all five of these closer to
whatever's in the middle, 

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.467
then that one's going to get
squeezed out. 

00:32:05.467 --> 00:32:09.333
So here's what happens if you go
to sodium. 

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:15.533
And now that distance is 4.0,
roughly an angstrom closer in 

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:19.300
order to get these close to the
sodium. 

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.567
Sodium to oxygen is 2.4. 

00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:25.967
So that sixth one got squeezed
out, but it 

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:28.767
came in from the bottom. 

00:32:28.767 --> 00:32:31.467
So if we look at the distances,
those are all in 

00:32:31.467 --> 00:32:35.767
the neighborhood of 2.4, 2.5,
one is 2.6, so just a little 

00:32:35.767 --> 00:32:38.367
bit bigger than the van der
Waals distance. 

00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:41.967
And the one on the bottom is
2.4, so it squeezes underneath 

00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:43.667
and is just happy. 

00:32:43.667 --> 00:32:46.100
But it leaves space on the top,
and this particular 

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.333
crystal structure had a water in
it. 

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:55.367
So the water is up on top at
2.32 Å'. 

00:32:55.367 --> 00:33:00.333
If we get smaller still with
lithium, now the lithium can't 

00:33:00.333 --> 00:33:01.900
shrink the ring down anymore. 

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.367
It gets close to just two of
them, 2.2 Å'-- 

00:33:05.367 --> 00:33:09.267
notice that's 2.1 and 2.1, 2.07.

00:33:09.267 --> 00:33:10.700
But it's further from the
others. 

00:33:13.933 --> 00:33:19.400
And notice it sits right in the
middle of the mean plane 

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.600
of these things. 

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.533
But what happens with
interactions 

00:33:22.533 --> 00:33:24.633
with the far oxygens? 

00:33:24.633 --> 00:33:26.833
This one has two waters. 

00:33:26.833 --> 00:33:31.900
So the waters bind to the
lithium, and then the protons 

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:36.700
of the water are hydrogen bonded
to those far oxygens. 

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:40.700
So lithium increases its size by
incorporating two waters 

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.433
with it, so it can fit in this
thing. 

00:33:44.433 --> 00:33:47.733
Now look at the equilibrium
constant for binding the 

00:33:47.733 --> 00:33:51.233
cations to this 18-crown-6. 

00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:55.400
Notice that potassium is by far
the biggest. So 

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.600
these are too big-- 

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.267
we looked at cesium. 

00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:01.433
Sodium and lithium were too
small, but 

00:34:01.433 --> 00:34:04.667
potassium is just right. 

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:10.867
So when this is 1 this is 60
times bigger. 

00:34:10.867 --> 00:34:13.367
Now the equilibrium constant is,
of course, the 

00:34:13.367 --> 00:34:16.467
concentration of the complex
divided by the concentrations 

00:34:16.467 --> 00:34:20.300
of the metal ion and the ligand
product. 

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.067
So it has units expressed this
way, it's per molar. 

00:34:25.067 --> 00:34:27.767
And if you look at the actual
value, not just relative to 

00:34:27.767 --> 00:34:30.233
one another which was what's
plotted first but the actual 

00:34:30.233 --> 00:34:32.933
value, you see that it's over a
million, 

00:34:32.933 --> 00:34:34.733
this equilibrium constant. 

00:34:34.733 --> 00:34:36.533
Now let's think of what that
means. 

00:34:36.533 --> 00:34:39.533
That one's 23,000. 

00:34:39.533 --> 00:34:44.067
So what this means is that when
the 

00:34:44.067 --> 00:34:48.033
ligand, down here, equals-- 

00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:55.733
when the ligand times K is 1,
then you have 50% 

00:34:55.733 --> 00:34:58.000
that this is 1:1. 

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.400
If you multiply this over here
and that comes out to 1, then 

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.267
you have the same amount of
metal that's uncomplexed as 

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:05.633
you have of metal that's
complexed. 

00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:12.067
So what that means is that it's
half complexed when you 

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:17.300
have 1 µM of concentration of
the ligand. 

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:18.933
So it holds on very, very
tightly. 

00:35:21.867 --> 00:35:24.800
Now, bear in mind that there's
something else that could 

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.800
complex with the potassium ion.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.933
The methanol solvent could do
so. 

00:35:31.933 --> 00:35:34.900
This is done in methanol solvent
at room temperature. 

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.600
Now methanol is 0.79 g/mL. 

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.600
Its molecular weight is 32. 

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.367
So we can calculate what its
concentration is. 

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:53.733
Its concentration is 25 M. So
the ligand, at 1 µM', 

00:35:53.733 --> 00:36:02.667
is able to beat out methanol at
25 M. So it's 29 million 

00:36:02.667 --> 00:36:06.667
times stronger than methanol at
binding to this by having 

00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:09.667
all these six arranged so they
grab it just right, it fits 

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:11.633
just right. 

00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:15.167
The energy involved is 13
kilocalories per mole of 

00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:16.000
stabilization. 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.667
Again, nothing compared to
covalent bonds 

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:21.367
that we talked about. 

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:24.933
But it's much more favorable in
the case of a potassium 

00:36:24.933 --> 00:36:27.400
than it is in the case of
sodium, just 5 

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.700
kilocalories less. 

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.933
But notice what this does when
you put this crown 

00:36:34.933 --> 00:36:37.067
around the golf ball. 

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:40.333
It makes it much bigger. 

00:36:40.333 --> 00:36:45.567
But what holds a salt together
is the attraction between the 

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:50.100
cation and the anion, which
depends very much on distance. 

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.500
So if you make the ions bigger,
as we mentioned in the 

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.400
last lecture, they won't
interact so strongly. 

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.800
So it's not so stable to be in
the solid salt form. 

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.533
It's easier to dissolve. 

00:37:01.533 --> 00:37:06.167
So you can dissolve potassium
permanganate in hydrocarbons 

00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:09.633
if you use crown ether to put in
there to make the potassium 

00:37:09.633 --> 00:37:11.933
ever so much bigger. 

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:15.733
So this has worked out in lab in
a way that's shown here. 

00:37:15.733 --> 00:37:19.200
So you have some organic
solvent, and you put something 

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:21.233
in it that you want to oxidize.

00:37:21.233 --> 00:37:22.967
So you need an oxidizing agent--

00:37:22.967 --> 00:37:25.933
ah, potassium permanganate. 

00:37:25.933 --> 00:37:30.067
So we have an organic substance
to be oxidized, and 

00:37:30.067 --> 00:37:33.133
we put in potassium
permanganate, and it just sits 

00:37:33.133 --> 00:37:34.700
on the bottom of the flask. 

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.633
It doesn't get to where the
organic molecules are, so 

00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:39.900
there's no reaction. 

00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:47.333
And if you put water in, that
will dissolve the potassium 

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:50.900
permanganate, but it won't get
the potassium permanganate 

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.333
where the organic stuff to be
oxidized is. 

00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:54.900
It'll just be two phases. 

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:58.867
A purple phase-- a water phase
that has the permanganate in 

00:37:58.867 --> 00:38:04.333
it, and then the organic phase
just floating above it. 

00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:09.167
But if you put in the crown
ether, then the permanganate 

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:14.500
can dissolve in the organic
solvent and can do the trick. 

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.400
So by making the cation large,
18-crown-6 destabilizes a 

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.333
solid, or aqueous permanganate,
allowing the 

00:38:21.333 --> 00:38:23.300
salt to dissolve in
hydrocarbons. 

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.800
And people call this purple
benzene. 

00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:28.600
I actually have never done this
and never seen purple 

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.933
benzene, but Professor Ziegler
has done it, and he tells me 

00:38:31.933 --> 00:38:34.800
that purple benzene prepared
this way isn't purple at all, 

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.933
it's yellow. 

00:38:35.933 --> 00:38:40.433
So that's just his one
experiment. 

00:38:40.433 --> 00:38:43.300
So I don't know that it's never
purple, but that's what 

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.333
he told me. 

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:48.300
So maybe purple benzene looks
sort of yellow, according to 

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.933
Professor Ziegler. 

00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:52.533
That would just be because
permanganate in an organic 

00:38:52.533 --> 00:38:54.833
solvent has a different spectrum
from permanganate in 

00:38:54.833 --> 00:38:57.633
water solvent, which wouldn't be
surprising. 

00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:00.300
But it works. 

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:02.900
People are able to do oxidations
this way. 

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:06.400
And it's called phase transfer
catalysis, because the idea is 

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.167
to get a reagent from one phase
into the other. 

00:39:09.167 --> 00:39:13.667
You use the crown ether as a
catalyst. It doesn't get 

00:39:13.667 --> 00:39:16.733
consumed, it just helps the
stuff get there and do its 

00:39:16.733 --> 00:39:19.967
reaction in the other phase, so
it's catalysis. 

00:39:19.967 --> 00:39:22.133
And you don't have to use crown
ethers for this, 

00:39:22.133 --> 00:39:23.900
although they are used for it. 

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.300
You can get a similar effect by
having other really big 

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.867
cations that make it possible
for an anion to go into the 

00:39:31.867 --> 00:39:32.800
organic phase. 

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:38.400
So tetraalkylammonium or
tetraakylphosphonium salts. 

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:42.133
The advantage of these things is
that there are solvents 

00:39:42.133 --> 00:39:45.533
that will dissolve both organic
things and potassium 

00:39:45.533 --> 00:39:48.600
permanganate, or other salt
reagents. 

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.500
But those salts [correction:
solvents], like dimethyl

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.300
sulfoxide that will do that, 

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.633
are dangerous and they're
expensive. 

00:39:54.633 --> 00:39:57.667
So this is an example of green
chemistry-- 

00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:01.233
to do chemistry in a more
environmentally favorable way 

00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:06.300
by using these ethers or simple
salts as a way of 

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.033
getting the reagents to mix. 

00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:14.233
Now a further development on
this is called cryptands, 

00:40:14.233 --> 00:40:17.567
which you notice is like a crown
ether, except that it 

00:40:17.567 --> 00:40:20.833
has a nitrogen in it which is
trivalent rather than oxygen 

00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:21.967
being divalent. 

00:40:21.967 --> 00:40:24.133
So you can get another bridge
across. 

00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:27.400
So you can get these crypts into
which to hide things. 

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.100
So here's an example of a
cryptand. 

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.033
And Jean-Marie Lehn who did this
work with Jean-Pierre 

00:40:34.033 --> 00:40:38.800
Sauvage, got the Nobel Prize for
this-- shared the Nobel 

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.500
Prize for these crown ethers. 

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:44.333
So now you can put different
numbers of these OCH2CH2 

00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:45.367
groups in here. 

00:40:45.367 --> 00:40:49.233
So you can make different sizes
for these rings. 

00:40:49.233 --> 00:40:54.167
So here is an example of where
l is 1, so you have 1 bridge 

00:40:54.167 --> 00:40:58.133
that has two oxygens, and two
bridges that have one oxygen, 

00:40:58.133 --> 00:41:00.133
and I've made a model of that
here. 

00:41:00.133 --> 00:41:03.767
So you see there are two oxygens
here on the top, but 

00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:05.867
there's one on this way and one
here. 

00:41:05.867 --> 00:41:09.167
And two nitrogens also point in
with their lone pairs. 

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.567
So that makes a pretty small
cavity inside. 

00:41:12.567 --> 00:41:17.200
I'll pass that one around to
you. 

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.300
You won't be surprised to hear
then that when you look at the 

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.467
equilibrium constant in methanol
for putting various 

00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:28.467
salts in there, that lithium is
the one that binds most 

00:41:28.467 --> 00:41:30.733
strongly, the smallest of the
ions. 

00:41:30.733 --> 00:41:37.000
It has an ionic radius of a
little less than 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.400
three-quarters of an angstrom. 

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.400
So it fits, but sodium doesn't
fit as well, potassium's bad. 

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.567
And these are whited out
because, in fact, they were 

00:41:48.567 --> 00:41:50.167
measured but they come way down
off the 

00:41:50.167 --> 00:41:52.567
bottom of this graph. 

00:41:52.567 --> 00:41:56.700
And now if you make one of the
other bridges have two oxygens 

00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:59.767
in it, so you increase the size
of the hole a little bit, 

00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:05.700
now it binds with sodium the
best. And if you put the other 

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.667
bridge bigger it binds potassium
the best. And if you 

00:42:09.667 --> 00:42:13.333
put two carbons in one of the
bridges, it binds rubidium the 

00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:18.000
best. If you put two carbons in
all the bridges it binds 

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.633
cesium best. And I put
cesium-137 here because that's 

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:27.833
a by-product of isotope
enrichment in nuclear 

00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:30.700
industry, and it's a common
pollutant that they want to 

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:31.767
get rid of. 

00:42:31.767 --> 00:42:36.567
So what they're trying to do now
is to design cryptands 

00:42:36.567 --> 00:42:40.533
that will readily bind to
cesium, so you can take the 

00:42:40.533 --> 00:42:45.467
earth or these million gallon
barrels that have this waste 

00:42:45.467 --> 00:42:46.567
stuff in them. 

00:42:46.567 --> 00:42:49.267
Put something in that will
specifically get the cesium, 

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:56.067
which is the worst actor among
these radioactive by-products. 

00:42:56.067 --> 00:43:00.133
That'll take them, put it in
another phase, and then make 

00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:03.167
it reversible so that you can
take the cryptand 

00:43:03.167 --> 00:43:04.967
off and use it again. 

00:43:04.967 --> 00:43:07.033
So there's a lot of work being
done on that 

00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:09.200
kind of thing now. 

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:12.333
But this also could be used in
biology. 

00:43:12.333 --> 00:43:15.633
For example, there's a bacterial
antibiotic called 

00:43:15.633 --> 00:43:18.833
nonactin, which you see is a
ring that has a lot 

00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:20.367
of oxygens in it. 

00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:23.667
Now that ring is quite a big
one, but you can curl it 

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:28.000
around like this, as I show
here-- 

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.333
bend those ends up. 

00:43:31.333 --> 00:43:35.233
And then the chain looks like
the seams on a tennis ball. 

00:43:35.233 --> 00:43:38.067
But you have all these oxygens
that can then be directed 

00:43:38.067 --> 00:43:39.900
toward the middle. 

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:45.067
So here's a picture of that
wrapped around a cation. 

00:43:45.067 --> 00:43:50.133
Now it's not easy to see the
three dimensions here, but if 

00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:55.700
you let it rotate you can see
what the shape is of this 

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.933
thing that's wrapped completely
around the 

00:43:57.933 --> 00:44:05.833
potassium ion with 8 oxygens
coordinated to the potassium. 

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:08.733
And there you can see the seams
on a tennis ball, which 

00:44:08.733 --> 00:44:11.900
trace this chain. 

00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:14.733
And the equilibrium constant in
methanol for holding on to 

00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:16.600
sodium is 512. 

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.300
But for potassium, the one
that's shown there, it's 

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.633
31,000, so it's very selective.

00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:27.533
It's even tighter with ammonium
in the middle. 

00:44:27.533 --> 00:44:31.333
So how do these things work in
biology? 

00:44:31.333 --> 00:44:36.367
I don't know, but the general
idea is that they can make 

00:44:36.367 --> 00:44:40.633
ions dissolve in organic things.

00:44:40.633 --> 00:44:44.833
So the potential in your cells
has to do with pumping sodium 

00:44:44.833 --> 00:44:48.267
and potassium ions back and
forth and creating a gradient. 

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:50.433
And if you suddenly put
something in that'll say to 

00:44:50.433 --> 00:44:52.967
potassium, you can go wherever
you want. 

00:44:52.967 --> 00:44:56.533
That destroys this and it's bad
for living things. 

00:44:56.533 --> 00:45:00.800
So anyhow, biology has a number
of things that can do 

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.767
this kind of trick with ions as
well. 

00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:08.867
Now the next topic is the
importance of solvent for 

00:45:08.867 --> 00:45:10.267
ionic reactions. 

00:45:10.267 --> 00:45:12.567
And I'm going to start this
since we started 

00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:13.933
a little bit late. 

00:45:13.933 --> 00:45:16.333
But we'll complete it next time.

00:45:16.333 --> 00:45:21.933
So we're interested in the
reaction, a water molecule 

00:45:21.933 --> 00:45:25.567
surrounded by water, in water
solvent, dissociating to give H+

00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:28.800
and O-H-. 

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.367
And we want to know what
energy's going to 

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:31.067
be involved in that. 

00:45:31.067 --> 00:45:33.167
What will the equilibrium
constant be. 

00:45:33.167 --> 00:45:35.733
And I think you people know the
equilibrium constant from 

00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:37.633
your AP chemistry. 

00:45:37.633 --> 00:45:40.533
But we're going to look at it a
different way as to what's 

00:45:40.533 --> 00:45:44.433
involved, what role the solvent
plays in this. 

00:45:44.433 --> 00:45:46.833
So the way we're going to do it
is to look at it without 

00:45:46.833 --> 00:45:49.500
solvent by going into the gas
phase. 

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.267
So if we pump in 6.3
kilocalories per mole, we can 

00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:59.267
make the water that's in water
become water in the gas phase. 

00:45:59.267 --> 00:46:03.167
And now we know we can look up
in Ellison's table a bond 

00:46:03.167 --> 00:46:06.100
dissociation energy for water
and find that it's going to 

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:10.833
take 120 kilocalories per mole
to get it apart to H atom and 

00:46:10.833 --> 00:46:14.100
O-H radical 

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.100
And then if we transfer an
electron from one to the 

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:22.433
other, that's then going to get
us the species we're 

00:46:22.433 --> 00:46:25.000
interested in, but in the gas
phase. 

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.600
That's 392 kilocalories per mole
in toto to do those 

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.167
three things. 

00:46:33.167 --> 00:46:37.967
And remember the Coulomb energy
is the gorilla in this 

00:46:37.967 --> 00:46:40.167
particular scheme. 

00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:45.333
It's that 332 kilocalories
divided by angstroms. So 

00:46:45.333 --> 00:46:49.267
that's the big one is that
electron transfer and getting 

00:46:49.267 --> 00:46:50.600
the ions apart. 

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.333
So the equilibrium constant in
the gas phase is 10^-290-- 

00:46:56.333 --> 00:46:59.933
not a very favorable process. 

00:46:59.933 --> 00:47:04.000
But we know that it can happen
in water. 

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.133
So the solvent has a lot to do
with it, and we'll talk about 

00:47:07.133 --> 00:47:08.367
that next time.

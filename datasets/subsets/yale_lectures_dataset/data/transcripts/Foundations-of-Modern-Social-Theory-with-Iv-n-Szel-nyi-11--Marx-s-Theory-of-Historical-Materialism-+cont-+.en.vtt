00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.767
Prof: So today we will
be talking about The German

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:09.009
Ideology,
and Marx becoming a historical

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.470
materialist.
 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:16.764
I just wanted to make a couple
of more comments about "The

00:00:16.764 --> 00:00:22.450
Theses on Feuerbach,"
where Marx is on the edge,

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.390
moving away from naturalism to
historical materialism.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.926
But the emphasis in "The
Theses on Feuerbach"

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:43.048
is not so much on materialism,
but it is much more on praxis,

00:00:43.048 --> 00:00:47.662
action,
change, the lack of

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:49.710
determination.
 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.220
Marx, as a materialist,
is usually seen as a

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.340
determinist.
 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.420
And if you took other courses
where much was--Marx was touched

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.587
upon, you were probably told
Marx is a determinist,

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.670
economic determinist.
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.560
And there's a lot of truth to
it, but half-truths,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.691
and he is struggling in
"The Theses on

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:24.189
Feuerbach"--
as I said, he's on his way from

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.390
naturalism to materialism,
and the central idea is,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.959
as I said,
praxis, human practices.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.349
And that's why I put down on
the slides that it is a kind of

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:42.275
dialectical,
what Marx represents in

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.780
"The Theses on
Feuerbach".

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.800
Now Marx himself very rarely
used the term 'dialectical'.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.956
He had a clear enough mind to
be suspicious about the word

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.840
'dialectics'.
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.998
Once, at an old age,
he wrote a letter to Engels and

00:02:05.998 --> 00:02:10.949
he said, "You know
Friedrich what?

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:16.235
When I don't know what
something, then I say it is

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.177
dialectical."
 

00:02:18.177 --> 00:02:19.150
Right?
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.848
And so dialectical means when
you couldn't really find out

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:27.970
what the relationship between
two phenomena is,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.465
when you say,
"Well this is

00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:30.430
dialectical."
 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.038
Well it's a bit too simplistic.
 

00:02:33.038 --> 00:02:37.741
The term 'dialectical',
as I am sure you all know,

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.620
go back to Greek philosophy.
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.700
But even in Greek philosophy,
the idea of dialectics was

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.120
emphasizing change and the
process.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.015
A famous Greek philosopher once
said--and that tries to capture

00:02:55.015 --> 00:02:59.010
the essence of
dialectics--"You cannot

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.150
step in the same river twice.
 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.150
Because if you step in the
river, five minutes later it is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.800
not quite the same river because
the water is gone;

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.080
this is a different
water." Right?

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.110
So that dialectics means that
the world is in flux,

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.318
is in change.
 

00:03:19.318 --> 00:03:23.471
That's, I think,
one important idea of

00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:24.930
dialectics.
 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.918
And in "The Theses on
Feuerbach",

00:03:27.918 --> 00:03:31.830
Marx emphasizes--right?--that
we are changing the world,

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.396
rather just taking it.
 

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:34.180
Right?
 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.235
In this sense he's dialectical,
and this is why he still

00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:41.038
resists materialism and
determinism.

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:47.163
There is another,
more contemporary adaptation of

00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:53.800
the word dialectics,
which comes from Georg Hegel.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.199
And Marx again was shying away
to use it very often.

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:03.158
But his friend Friedrich Engels
used it.

00:04:03.158 --> 00:04:06.270
He even said there is a
dialectical materialism.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.552
Engels made a distinction
between historical and

00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:11.370
dialectical materialism.
 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.900
Now what was dialectics in
Hegel?

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.115
Hegel was trying to capturing
the process of change.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:22.089
Right?
 

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:28.038
Already in Greek philosophy the
dialecticians emphasized that if

00:04:28.038 --> 00:04:32.351
you are looking at the world,
this is not a picture,

00:04:32.351 --> 00:04:35.391
it is a movie--
right?--and every minute you

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:37.269
see something different.
 

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:41.964
Now Hegel tried to come to
terms with what is the essence

00:04:41.964 --> 00:04:43.389
of this change?
 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.214
In this essence of this change,
he was looking at

00:04:47.214 --> 00:04:48.569
contradictions.
 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.199
Contradictions drive the change.
 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:59.538
So Hegel made a big distinction
between thesis,

00:04:59.538 --> 00:05:03.259
antithesis and synthesis.
 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.877
So the change,
what dialectics captures

00:05:06.877 --> 00:05:11.954
normally in social life,
it starts with a thesis,

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:15.778
and actual conditions,
an antithesis,

00:05:15.778 --> 00:05:19.639
which is the negation of the
situation,

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.966
and then it leads to a
synthesis, which is the negation

00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:25.247
of the negation.
 

00:05:25.247 --> 00:05:25.970
Right?
 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.906
In some ways the original
condition is reconstituted,

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:34.860
but in a different way;
as Hegel put it,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.009
"preserving it by
abolishing it."

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:39.899
Right?
 

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:46.290
That's the Hegelian insight
what actually was--this kind of

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.579
logic was attractive to Marx and
the Marxists.

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:53.910
Anyway, so this is dialectical.
 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.545
And Marx, from dialectical,
from the philosophy of praxis

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:04.081
where praxis is crucial,
eventually moves towards a more

00:06:04.081 --> 00:06:09.108
clearly deterministic,
positivistic social science in

00:06:09.108 --> 00:06:13.966
which you have a very clearer
idea what is the key cause and

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.365
the consequences.
 

00:06:15.365 --> 00:06:16.189
Right?
 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:24.199
Doing very much what positivist
social science is doing today;

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.706
identifying the dependent
variable and independent

00:06:28.706 --> 00:06:32.358
variable,
to come up with a hypothesis

00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:36.910
how the dependent variable will
cause variation,

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.444
and the independent variable
will cause variation in the

00:06:41.444 --> 00:06:44.850
dependent variable,
and then to describe it.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.160
That is very much the mature
Marx.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.218
And because Marx was moving
into, today we will call it

00:06:54.218 --> 00:06:59.379
normal science,
he becomes a real scientist.

00:06:59.379 --> 00:07:04.701
He was becoming so much of a
scientist that at one point he

00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:09.747
began to doubt there is much
sense to make a distinction

00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:13.509
between social sciences and
sciences.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:21.701
He himself began to see himself
as the Darwin of social

00:07:21.701 --> 00:07:23.370
sciences.
 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.839
He was so much attracted with
scientific reasoning--

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.687
the late Marx,
the second Marx we will start

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:36.184
talking about--
that he actually for awhile

00:07:36.184 --> 00:07:41.425
considered to dedicate the book,
Kapital,

00:07:41.425 --> 00:07:46.310
to Charles Darwin,
because he saw himself as doing

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:52.990
for human history what Marx did
to the evolution of the species.

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:59.160
He wanted to do an evolution of
human societies.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.985
Now luckily for Marx he did not
do that.

00:08:02.985 --> 00:08:03.769
Right?
 

00:08:03.769 --> 00:08:06.273
He did not become a social
Darwinist.

00:08:06.273 --> 00:08:06.829
Right?
 

00:08:06.829 --> 00:08:09.480
He resisted the temptation.
 

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.509
But he was tempted.
 

00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:16.577
Okay, I just want to go back
very briefly to two "Theses

00:08:16.577 --> 00:08:19.956
on Feuerbach,"
because they are very

00:08:19.956 --> 00:08:20.800
important.
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.730
Right?
 

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.589
And this is the idea. Right?
 

00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:28.670
He is now
criticizing--right?--Feuerbach.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.548
And the problem with Feuerbach,
he said,

00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:36.692
that Feuerbach,
and other people who were

00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:43.000
materialists before him,
they thought that there are

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.287
things outside there,
objective things,

00:08:47.287 --> 00:08:49.960
which are outside of the
subject,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.288
which creates a knowledge about
these objects--

00:08:55.288 --> 00:08:58.589
he called that
Gegenstand,

00:08:58.589 --> 00:09:02.567
object--
and the knowledge is nothing

00:09:02.567 --> 00:09:08.461
else but a reflection in human
mind of the object outside

00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.408
there.
 

00:09:09.408 --> 00:09:12.919
This is a very typical theory
of truth.

00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:13.658
Right?
 

00:09:13.658 --> 00:09:19.995
Very widely shared today,
and probably a theory of truth

00:09:19.995 --> 00:09:24.028
what many of you in this room
share.

00:09:24.028 --> 00:09:25.179
Right?
 

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:29.269
When is your knowledge accurate?
 

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.970
You think about your mind as a
mirror.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.227
If the image of the object,
or the objective world outside,

00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:42.760
is accurately reflected in the
mirror of your mind,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.211
then you got it.
 

00:09:44.211 --> 00:09:45.210
Right?
 

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:50.673
So what we try to do is to have
the most perfect mirror in our

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:54.291
mind,
and capture the objective

00:09:54.291 --> 00:10:00.788
reality as precisely and as much
in detail as possible.

00:10:00.788 --> 00:10:08.375
Well Marx says this is simply,
you know, reflection,

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:12.691
and we should go beyond that.
 

00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:14.028
Right?
 

00:10:14.028 --> 00:10:18.869
He said, "What is good
about what Feuerbach did,

00:10:18.869 --> 00:10:24.639
what is good what"--for
instance, what Montesquieu did.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:29.373
These were the two people we
discussed so far who were

00:10:29.373 --> 00:10:32.320
clearly, you know,
materialist;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.090
though I mean Hobbes was pretty
much a materialist as well,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:40.232
believing that this is sort of
biological conditions which

00:10:40.232 --> 00:10:42.850
drive us and makes us what we
are.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.910
So they all started from
sensuousness.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:47.788
Right?
 

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:53.279
That the reality is something
what we can get at through our

00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:53.932
senses.
 

00:10:53.932 --> 00:10:54.769
Right?
 

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:56.724
We smell it,
we touch it,

00:10:56.724 --> 00:11:00.307
we see it, and unless we touch
it, we see it,

00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:03.481
we smell it,
we doubt whether it exists.

00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.460
Right?
 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.846
That's the
difference--right?--between

00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:08.590
materialist and idealist.
 

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.663
Ideas you don't get through
your senses.

00:11:12.663 --> 00:11:13.500
Right?
 

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.120
You get it through your mind.
 

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:22.015
But he said this is--this
materialism is sensuous only in

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:25.070
the sense of contemplation.
 

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.702
The object is outside of the
subject and you get a grasp of

00:11:29.702 --> 00:11:31.700
it through your senses.
 

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.571
And he said,
"Well, but what I am

00:11:35.571 --> 00:11:40.279
suggesting in my new approach is
sensuous--

00:11:40.279 --> 00:11:45.190
all right?--but a sensuous
human activity--

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.080
an activity, as such."
 

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:51.759
I mentioned very briefly that
this, in the last lecture--let

00:11:51.759 --> 00:11:55.408
me just make--come back to this
point again.

00:11:55.408 --> 00:12:00.885
This is what Jürgen
Habermas, arguably the greatest

00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:06.659
philosopher of the twentieth
century--well he's still alive

00:12:06.659 --> 00:12:09.149
but he may--you know?
 

00:12:09.149 --> 00:12:12.678
The twenty-first century has a
long way to go to decide who

00:12:12.678 --> 00:12:14.808
will be the greatest
philosopher.

00:12:14.808 --> 00:12:18.440
But many thinks that
Jürgen Habermas was the

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.070
greatest philosopher of the
twentieth century.

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.407
He said, "Well yes,
Marx in "The Theses on

00:12:26.407 --> 00:12:28.874
Feuerbach"
is right"

00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:30.320
at one point.
 

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.129
I mean, Habermas had his
'culture' turn,

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:37.058
moved away from materialism.
 

00:12:37.058 --> 00:12:41.884
But in most of his life he
said, "I am a materialist

00:12:41.884 --> 00:12:46.970
because I also believe that the
ultimate reality has to come

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.250
through sensuous experiences,
through the senses." Right?

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.490
But he said,
"Marx later on,

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.860
the mature Marx became
reductionist,

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:05.139
because the sensuous activity
he identified with the economy,

00:13:05.139 --> 00:13:09.480
with production,
with economic activities."

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.820
And he said,
"In "The Theses on

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.808
Feuerbach"
he got it right.

00:13:13.808 --> 00:13:17.980
All sensuous activity are
material."

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.759
"So therefore,"
he says,

00:13:20.759 --> 00:13:27.490
"let's not simply limit
our analysis to production,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.519
but let's look at human
interaction."

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:35.181
When we interact with each
other, this is also a sensuous

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:35.929
activity.
 

00:13:35.929 --> 00:13:36.678
Right?
 

00:13:36.678 --> 00:13:43.370
So he creates peace between
Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:45.315
Many people try to do that.
 

00:13:45.315 --> 00:13:45.820
Right?
 

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:51.489
That this is not an opposition,
that it is either production or

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:53.408
your sexual drives.
 

00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:57.910
You know, your sexual
drives--your sexual interaction

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:00.854
with others--is very much
sensuous.

00:14:00.854 --> 00:14:01.720
Right?
 

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.110
It's actually more sensuous
than doing a job--right?-- than,

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:14.070
you know, being in McDonald's
and serving hamburgers.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.970
That's sensuous activity.
 

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.863
But all right,
you know, sexual interaction is

00:14:19.863 --> 00:14:21.679
very much sensuous.
 

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:24.220
That's Habermas's point.
 

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.605
And Marx, in "The Theses
on Feuerbach",

00:14:27.605 --> 00:14:29.580
opens this possibility up.
 

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.139
It's a very open argument.
 

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:33.330
Okay?
 

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.235
This is actually one of the
reasons why he does not publish

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:38.659
it.
 

00:14:38.659 --> 00:14:40.000
It's too vague.
 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.399
He wanted to be more precise,
and then he wanted to go--

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:47.808
he was reading Adam Smith and
Ricardo,

00:14:47.808 --> 00:14:51.101
and spent all of his time in
the British Library reading

00:14:51.101 --> 00:14:55.071
these economists,
and he wanted to bring it back

00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.789
down to earth,
to the economy and economic

00:14:58.789 --> 00:14:59.620
interest.
 

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.609
And now let me start to this,
because I think that's very

00:15:04.609 --> 00:15:07.460
important the theory of truth.
 

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.230
And I want you to think about
it.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:12.690
I think this is very
interesting.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.830
So what is truth?
 

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:20.017
And to be very
simplistic--right?--you have two

00:15:20.017 --> 00:15:23.399
competing theories of truth.
 

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:28.003
One theory of truth,
what I think most of you have

00:15:28.003 --> 00:15:31.573
in your mind,
is the kind of reflection

00:15:31.573 --> 00:15:35.990
theory of truth--that our mind
is a mirror.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:42.567
More accurately it reflects the
objective reality out there more

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:47.788
true, the knowledge what we have
in our mind is.

00:15:47.788 --> 00:15:52.227
And Marx, in "The Theses
on Feuerbach",

00:15:52.227 --> 00:15:54.168
says, "Not so.
 

00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:58.490
The truth is a practical
question.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:05.374
The problem with the reflection
theory of truth is that it is

00:16:05.374 --> 00:16:09.850
positivist and it is
alienated."

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:15.850
I'll throw in another word
coined by a major Marxist

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:22.908
philosopher of the twentieth
century, Georg Lukács.

00:16:22.908 --> 00:16:27.480
He called it this is reified
consciousness.

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.982
Reified--you know,
Lukács was writing in

00:16:32.982 --> 00:16:40.519
German, and in German he used
the term Verdinglichung.

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:42.908
Ding means a thing.
 

00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:45.450
I think reification is a very
good translation.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:50.029
Only those of us who speak
English but do not speak Latin

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:52.563
don't necessarily quite get it.
 

00:16:52.563 --> 00:16:53.298
Right?
 

00:16:53.298 --> 00:16:57.200
Rei in Latin means the
thing.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.389
Reification is the process in
which we turn stuff,

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:07.368
what is not a thing,
into an objective thing.

00:17:07.368 --> 00:17:11.273
It's a kind
of--right?--Lukácsian

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:16.278
reinterpretation of Marx's
notion of alienation.

00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:21.333
Marx's term,
in German, for reification was

00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:27.618
Entfremdung;
fremd means alien. Right?

00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:29.963
So alienation is a good
translation.

00:17:29.963 --> 00:17:30.500
Right?
 

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.342
You are alienated if you feel
alien, if you feel homeless in

00:17:35.342 --> 00:17:36.410
this world.
 

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.710
Now I think but Lukács
has an interesting idea--

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:45.179
right?--that the essence of
alienation is when we're

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:50.157
beginning to see the world,
what actually we created--the

00:17:50.157 --> 00:17:56.338
world is our creation and this
objective world will rule us.

00:17:56.338 --> 00:18:01.424
We do not see ourselves as the
masters of the world,

00:18:01.424 --> 00:18:05.612
but we see ourselves as ruled
by the world.

00:18:05.612 --> 00:18:06.608
Right?
 

00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:09.523
And this is reified
consciousness,

00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:13.851
when we're beginning to see the
objective reality,

00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:16.587
we cannot do anything about it.
 

00:18:16.587 --> 00:18:17.558
Right?
 

00:18:17.558 --> 00:18:21.548
And the essence is the
philosophy of praxis of the

00:18:21.548 --> 00:18:24.318
young Marx,
ending--right?--with "The

00:18:24.318 --> 00:18:28.470
Theses on Feuerbach",
the point is to change it;

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:31.240
the point is to change the
world.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:40.856
So in contemporary discourse we
usually call this positivism.

00:18:40.856 --> 00:18:42.140
Right?
 

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:46.586
Positivists are those social
scientists who think there are

00:18:46.586 --> 00:18:51.318
objective facts out there,
and the purpose of social

00:18:51.318 --> 00:18:56.740
investigation is to establish
most objectively and most

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:01.960
concretely what those objective
social facts are.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.355
You are an economist,
you describe the objective

00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:06.917
facts.
 

00:19:06.917 --> 00:19:07.759
Right?
 

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:11.078
You say, "Well you have to
maximize profit,

00:19:11.078 --> 00:19:14.068
because if you do not maximize
profit,

00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:17.436
then you will be wiped out of
business."

00:19:17.436 --> 00:19:18.048
Right?
 

00:19:18.048 --> 00:19:22.450
This is almost like a force of
nature.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.778
Again, if I can recall Georg
Lukács,

00:19:27.778 --> 00:19:34.121
he coined this wonderful term
second nature.

00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:35.390
Right?
 

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:40.924
That we're beginning to think
about social life as if it were

00:19:40.924 --> 00:19:45.630
natural, as if it would have the
power of nature;

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:51.480
the economic laws look like
lightening.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.750
You know?
 

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.425
Like, you know,
this force-- like earthquakes.

00:19:56.425 --> 00:19:57.078
Right?
 

00:19:57.078 --> 00:20:00.920
You can't do virtually nothing
about an earthquake.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.953
If we can't predict what we
can't predict,

00:20:03.953 --> 00:20:07.358
we can just get into our car
and get out of it.

00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:08.098
Right?
 

00:20:08.098 --> 00:20:10.720
But even we cannot really
predict earthquakes.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.371
That's one of the problems.
 

00:20:12.371 --> 00:20:12.798
Right?
 

00:20:12.798 --> 00:20:16.150
Well now we can predict when a
hurricane is coming.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.480
What can we do?
 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.628
You get in the car and get out
of there, where the hurricane

00:20:20.628 --> 00:20:21.269
will come.
 

00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:25.827
Now, you know,
the point is that positivism

00:20:25.827 --> 00:20:32.990
does posits social phenomena as
if they had the force of nature.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:38.034
And that's what Lukács
called we create the social

00:20:38.034 --> 00:20:43.077
world as if it were second
nature, as if it had the force

00:20:43.077 --> 00:20:44.338
of nature.
 

00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:47.598
He said this is all wrong
because this is the world what

00:20:47.598 --> 00:20:48.369
we created.
 

00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:50.328
We should rule it. Right?
 

00:20:50.328 --> 00:20:53.368
That's the idea,
to overcome alienation;

00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:56.766
to become the master of your
fate.

00:20:56.766 --> 00:20:57.588
Right?
 

00:20:57.588 --> 00:21:02.420
To be able--right?--to change
the objective conditions.

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.740
And we will--you know,
in The German Ideology,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.720
Marx puts it very powerfully.
 

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:12.569
I would say it's almost the
last word what in this debate he

00:21:12.569 --> 00:21:14.048
said-- was said.
 

00:21:14.048 --> 00:21:17.598
I don't think anybody really
improved on it.

00:21:17.598 --> 00:21:23.868
He said, "Well,
humans change the conditions.

00:21:23.868 --> 00:21:28.724
But we were born under certain
conditions, and we can only

00:21:28.724 --> 00:21:32.557
change the conditions we were
born into."

00:21:32.557 --> 00:21:33.410
Right?
 

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:37.380
So it's an interesting
interaction between yes,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:39.759
I mean we can't do
anything--right?--

00:21:39.759 --> 00:21:41.990
because we were born into
conditions,

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.430
but within some limits we can
change those conditions.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.092
By the way, it's not all that
different from

00:21:49.092 --> 00:21:54.202
Hobbes--right?--and voluntary
action, the theory of voluntary

00:21:54.202 --> 00:21:55.140
action.
 

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:57.200
There is a similarity here.
 

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.950
Now I'll finish this and get
onto The German Ideology.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.271
But there is one thing what I
cannot leave out,

00:22:06.271 --> 00:22:11.910
too--I think too insightful and
important to leave it out.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.208
So let me come back to this
subject and object issue.

00:22:16.208 --> 00:22:16.868
Right?
 

00:22:16.868 --> 00:22:22.088
What I've suggested,
it is so extremely important,

00:22:22.088 --> 00:22:26.358
not only for Marx but for the
whole critical theory,

00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:29.982
and, in fact,
for anti-positivism of all

00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:34.630
sorts in the twentieth and
twenty-first century.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:36.631
I mentioned,
for instance,

00:22:36.631 --> 00:22:39.673
cultural theory,
which is very strongly

00:22:39.673 --> 00:22:44.478
anti-positivist--right?--and
rejects social science as normal

00:22:44.478 --> 00:22:45.599
science.
 

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:49.548
So what we have is subject.
 

00:22:49.548 --> 00:22:56.272
And that is you--right?--the
person who has a consciousness

00:22:56.272 --> 00:23:03.343
and is a cognitive subject--is
involved in cognitive activity,

00:23:03.343 --> 00:23:06.009
creating knowledge.
 

00:23:06.009 --> 00:23:12.078
And then there are objects
about which we create knowledge.

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:20.075
Reflection theory of truth said
that this is a mirror and if the

00:23:20.075 --> 00:23:27.434
objects are accurately described
in the mirror of our mind,

00:23:27.434 --> 00:23:29.720
that is truth.
 

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:35.226
This is the whole test of
having verification of

00:23:35.226 --> 00:23:36.515
hypotheses.
 

00:23:36.515 --> 00:23:37.569
Right?
 

00:23:37.569 --> 00:23:39.900
I develop a hypothesis.
 

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:44.765
Then I go there and test it on
the social reality,

00:23:44.765 --> 00:23:48.836
and if it is matches,
then it is verified,

00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:50.027
I got truth.
 

00:23:50.027 --> 00:23:51.118
Right?
 

00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:57.968
Now the philosophy of praxis
says that truth is not simply a

00:23:57.968 --> 00:24:05.049
reflection, it's an interaction
between subject and object;

00:24:05.049 --> 00:24:07.720
that's where truth is.
 

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:15.423
And there is this wonderful
philosopher-- not a very easy

00:24:15.423 --> 00:24:21.339
read, but still I think a
wonderful mind.

00:24:21.339 --> 00:24:28.920
His name is Adorno.
 

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.202
Adorno belonged to the
Frankfurt School and was active

00:24:34.202 --> 00:24:38.788
mainly in the 1940s and
'60s--'30s and '60s.

00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:45.240
And well he formulated this so
powerfully.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.338
He said, "What is
truth?"

00:24:47.338 --> 00:24:54.248
He said, "The truth is the
force-field between subject and

00:24:54.248 --> 00:24:55.696
object."
 

00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:56.700
Right?
 

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.279
"Not simply a reflection
of the object,

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:05.027
but it is between the tension
of subject and object."

00:25:05.027 --> 00:25:05.858
Right?
 

00:25:05.858 --> 00:25:08.211
I think this is beautifully
done.

00:25:08.211 --> 00:25:08.798
Right?
 

00:25:08.798 --> 00:25:13.240
It is in the force-field of
subject and object.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:21.500
So let me also add one more
point, and then we can move away

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.578
the theory of truth.
 

00:25:24.578 --> 00:25:29.294
But I want you guys to think
about what is truth?

00:25:29.294 --> 00:25:30.078
Right?
 

00:25:30.078 --> 00:25:34.920
When can you say an idea is
true?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.849
In fact, Adorno at one point
said about Nazism.

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:39.990
You know?
 

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:44.964
He said--experiencing,
he was Jewish and many of his

00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:49.160
family were killed--right?--by
the Nazis.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.516
And he said,
"The reality,

00:25:52.516 --> 00:25:57.104
Nazi reality,
is so miserable that it does

00:25:57.104 --> 00:26:01.579
not deserve to be called
true."

00:26:01.579 --> 00:26:03.519
You see the point?
 

00:26:03.519 --> 00:26:09.453
You also say that occasionally,
when you see something horrible

00:26:09.453 --> 00:26:13.284
and you can say,
"No, that cannot be

00:26:13.284 --> 00:26:15.390
true." Right?
 

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.538
This is exactly Adorno's point.
 

00:26:18.538 --> 00:26:23.960
This can be so miserable that
you say it cannot be true.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.096
And the idea is that they are
so miserable that you are

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:32.770
completely powerlessness about
these nature-like forces though

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.068
it is unacceptable--right?
 

00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:37.843
You should be able to do
something about it.

00:26:37.843 --> 00:26:38.358
Right?
 

00:26:38.358 --> 00:26:42.090
We should have been able to do
something about Auschwitz,

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.890
and they could not do anything
about it.

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:46.720
And that's what Adorno said.
 

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:52.099
This reality was such that it
should not be called true;

00:26:52.099 --> 00:26:54.029
it cannot be truth.
 

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:56.660
You see what it is getting at?
 

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:04.400
A very final point about this
theory of truth,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:12.828
and this is through another
guy, Karl Mannheim.

00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:19.950
This is very much along this
line.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.960
He was very much not a Marxist.
 

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.788
He was a conservative
philosopher.

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:28.098
His major work was done in
England.

00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:35.809
Mannheim once said,
"The truth is not being.

00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:40.180
The truth is becoming."
 

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.880
Bingo. Right?
 

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.960
Wonderfully put. Right?
 

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.650
The truth is not simply that
you describe how things are.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:54.943
You really know what the truth
is when you know what it can be,

00:27:54.943 --> 00:27:58.190
and what you can do
about it.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.472
The real purpose of cognition
is not simply to describe the

00:28:03.472 --> 00:28:08.028
world but to change
it--right?--to make it a better

00:28:08.028 --> 00:28:08.940
world.
 

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.854
That's when you have real
truth, when you know how to make

00:28:12.854 --> 00:28:14.020
the world better.
 

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:14.640
Right?
 

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.838
So the truth is not being but
becoming.

00:28:17.838 --> 00:28:19.920
And that's the philosophy of
praxis.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:26.410
But I think that's where Marx
is in writing "The Theses

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:31.143
on Feuerbach",
and that's what he is moving

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:35.356
away from when he's beginning to
write The German

00:28:35.356 --> 00:28:36.680
Ideology.
 

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:44.170
But he is writing together with
Friedrich Engels.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:49.059
And now you see he has to
abandon--he cannot publish the

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:52.705
book-- "The Theses on
Feuerbach"

00:28:52.705 --> 00:28:55.461
because it is too
voluntaristic.

00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:56.529
Right?
 

00:28:56.529 --> 00:29:01.010
He abandoned The Paris
Manuscript because it was

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.593
fluffy.
 

00:29:01.593 --> 00:29:02.338
Right?
 

00:29:02.338 --> 00:29:06.005
"Nobody will believe me
that the revolution will come

00:29:06.005 --> 00:29:08.900
because the proletariat is
alienated."

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.663
And then when he finished--I
think this--I mean,

00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:16.827
not all eleven sentences are
great, but some of those

00:29:16.827 --> 00:29:20.108
sentences are really great
sentences.

00:29:20.108 --> 00:29:24.170
He wrote it down and he never
published it because he said,

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.180
"Well, this is too
voluntaristic."

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:27.880
Right?
 

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.001
"I have to come up with a
more- with a theory which will

00:29:32.001 --> 00:29:35.299
prove to people that the
revolution will come.

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:37.858
Capitalism has to fall.
 

00:29:37.858 --> 00:29:41.032
It is not only a question
whether we decide to change it

00:29:41.032 --> 00:29:43.630
or we don't have to change
it." Right?

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.104
"I have to come up with a
theory which will prove that

00:29:47.104 --> 00:29:49.740
capitalism will have to
fall." Right?

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:54.279
That's what puts him into the
deterministic mode.

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:57.308
He actually becomes never
really deterministic.

00:29:57.308 --> 00:30:01.490
It's a very simplistic reading
of Marx.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:04.900
You know, after all this guy is
a theorist of the revolution.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.093
He thought that revolutionary
ideas should be put into

00:30:09.093 --> 00:30:10.358
people's head.
 

00:30:10.358 --> 00:30:14.670
This idea did not think that
ideas do not matter.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.489
If he would have believed ideas
do not matter,

00:30:17.489 --> 00:30:20.622
he would not have spent,
you know, all of his time,

00:30:20.622 --> 00:30:23.630
eight in the morning,
nine-- until nine p.m.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.207
in the British library,
and writing books.

00:30:26.207 --> 00:30:26.710
Right?
 

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:30.118
If ideas do not matter,
why do you write down ideas?

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:34.037
Because he believed that ideas
will change the world.

00:30:34.037 --> 00:30:34.640
Right?
 

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:37.650
So he was never completely a
deterministic.

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:41.655
But in the nature of the work
he's moving towards economic

00:30:41.655 --> 00:30:42.640
determinism.
 

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.500
And the reason is that now he
wants to prove that

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:50.038
capitalism--yes,
it had great achievement.

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:57.585
During the time of capitalism
society developed more than ever

00:30:57.585 --> 00:31:00.058
before capitalism.
 

00:31:00.058 --> 00:31:02.890
But nevertheless it will have
to come an end.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:05.318
Capitalism will not last
forever.

00:31:05.318 --> 00:31:09.648
And now he has to prove that
thesis, that it must come to an

00:31:09.648 --> 00:31:10.088
end.
 

00:31:10.088 --> 00:31:15.640
So that puts him on a
deterministic trajectory.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.000
That's what makes him--he has
to become--he has to accept

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.730
materialism;
that material conditions

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.598
determine human action and
consciousness.

00:31:25.598 --> 00:31:29.625
So that's what he--they are
beginning to develop in The

00:31:29.625 --> 00:31:31.180
German Ideology.
 

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.558
And this is the structure of
the book.

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:37.910
The first chapter is a critique
on Feuerbach;

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.365
takes on from "The Theses
on Feuerbach"

00:31:41.365 --> 00:31:45.828
but tightens the argument and
becomes strictly materialist,

00:31:45.828 --> 00:31:49.588
and gets out of this
voluntaristic element.

00:31:49.588 --> 00:31:54.472
He has some introductory
remarks about critique of

00:31:54.472 --> 00:32:00.751
idealism and the premises of the
new materialism he is proposing

00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:04.394
now,
what he's beginning to call now

00:32:04.394 --> 00:32:08.196
historical materialism--
stays away from the word

00:32:08.196 --> 00:32:09.190
'dialectical'.
 

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.404
And then he develops--right?--a
materialist conception of

00:32:13.404 --> 00:32:16.190
history and historical
development.

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:22.125
He replaces Adam Smith's
categorization of societies as

00:32:22.125 --> 00:32:26.852
hunting, gathering,
grazing, agricultural or

00:32:26.852 --> 00:32:30.700
commercial with a new typology.
 

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.665
This new typology will be the
typology of the modes of

00:32:34.665 --> 00:32:35.640
production.
 

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:39.040
Not--in fact,
in The German Ideology

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.119
he stays pretty close to Adam
Smith.

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.519
I will point this out.
 

00:32:43.519 --> 00:32:45.118
And this is one of his problems.
 

00:32:45.118 --> 00:32:49.635
This is one of the reasons why
The German Ideology was

00:32:49.635 --> 00:32:52.346
also left unfinished and
unpublished.

00:32:52.346 --> 00:32:53.098
Right?
 

00:32:53.098 --> 00:32:57.359
As I indicated,
it was first published--and not

00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:03.009
the complete text--only in 1903,
well after the deaths of Marx

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:04.400
and Engels.
 

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.980
Then he writes about the
origins of idealist conception

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.910
of history, where it is coming
from.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:18.459
He's writing about the
development of productive

00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:23.977
forces, and eventually this
covers the notion of relations

00:33:23.977 --> 00:33:25.720
of production.
 

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.068
I will make a big deal out of
this,

00:33:28.068 --> 00:33:32.009
because I think that's one of
the reasons that The German

00:33:32.009 --> 00:33:36.111
Ideology fails,
that until the very end he does

00:33:36.111 --> 00:33:40.098
not know the term of relations
of production,

00:33:40.098 --> 00:33:43.548
and he runs into some very big
problems.

00:33:43.548 --> 00:33:47.519
And then he writes on Bruno
Bauer and Max Stirner.

00:33:47.519 --> 00:33:49.558
These are Young Hegelians.
 

00:33:49.558 --> 00:33:52.368
People usually don't read these
chapters.

00:33:52.368 --> 00:33:56.154
And Volume II,
I mean you must be a Marx

00:33:56.154 --> 00:33:58.288
expert to read this.
 

00:33:58.288 --> 00:34:01.808
This is really basically
irrelevant, not very

00:34:01.808 --> 00:34:02.930
interesting.
 

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.269
Okay, what are the major themes
in The German Ideology?

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:11.460
First, he offers a materialist
view of history.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.110
Then he offers a theory of
modes of production.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:20.985
Then he's beginning to develop
forces of production and

00:34:20.985 --> 00:34:26.210
initially division of labor;
and this is a problem.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.719
This is very much Adam Smith.
 

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.746
He's still very strongly under
Adam Smith and understands the

00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:36.840
evolution of society as the
evolution of division of labor.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:41.454
And then he describes-- tries
to describe the forces of

00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:44.530
production and division of
labor--

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:48.215
modes of production and
describes a subsection and modes

00:34:48.215 --> 00:34:51.699
of production and give a very
about human history.

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:55.119
And then he develops what I
would call--

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:58.190
he's the first who creates a
sociology of knowledge--

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:03.159
how to study sociologically,
socially how you can understand

00:35:03.159 --> 00:35:05.960
conscience,
human consciousness.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.989
Okay, so the materialist view
of history.

00:35:08.989 --> 00:35:14.583
And now here you can see Marx
the positivist social scientist

00:35:14.583 --> 00:35:15.610
speaking.
 

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:19.681
And Marx is the first of
positivist social

00:35:19.681 --> 00:35:24.050
scientists--rigorous positivist
scientist.

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:29.103
And what he describes here will
be subscribed and accepted most

00:35:29.103 --> 00:35:34.074
of the positivist types in your
political science or sociology

00:35:34.074 --> 00:35:37.170
or economics or psychology
departments.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.150
Right?
 

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:43.467
He said, "The premises
from which we begin with are not

00:35:43.467 --> 00:35:47.983
arbitrary ones;
not dogmas but real premises,

00:35:47.983 --> 00:35:52.717
from which abstractions can
only be made in the

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.880
imagination."
 

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.673
So you start from the objective
conditions and then you

00:35:58.673 --> 00:36:00.219
speculate from this.
 

00:36:00.219 --> 00:36:05.992
So what we start are real
individuals, and the activities

00:36:05.992 --> 00:36:09.972
of these individual;
actual activities of these

00:36:09.972 --> 00:36:10.829
individuals.
 

00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:14.420
And then he moves a little
further.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:19.702
Their conditions of life,
both what they find already

00:36:19.702 --> 00:36:25.393
existing and those what they
produce by their activities.

00:36:25.393 --> 00:36:26.409
Right?
 

00:36:26.409 --> 00:36:31.360
So, he said,
"German philosophers

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.309
descended from the heaven to
earth.

00:36:36.309 --> 00:36:39.702
Now we are ascending from earth
to heaven."

00:36:39.702 --> 00:36:40.280
Right?
 

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.460
"We do not deduction,
we do induction.

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.889
This is the inductive method
what we use."

00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:50.119
And if you are a positivist,
you will love it.

00:36:50.119 --> 00:36:54.512
You see, this is real serious
science--right?--looking at

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:55.139
facts.
 

00:36:55.139 --> 00:36:58.358
And then he said,
"Well ideas have no

00:36:58.358 --> 00:37:00.400
history, no development.
 

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.492
Man developing the material
conditions, and then material

00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:08.949
intercourse, altered their
thinking.

00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:13.842
So it is really our material
existence which has a history,

00:37:13.842 --> 00:37:18.230
and ideas reflect those
material conditions."

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:22.286
And then he's beginning to
develop the theory of modes of

00:37:22.286 --> 00:37:23.230
production.
 

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.206
He said, "Well,
man can distinguish from

00:37:26.206 --> 00:37:28.099
animals in different ways.
 

00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:33.032
But most important is that we
produce, that we change the

00:37:33.032 --> 00:37:36.029
environment in a purposeful
manner.

00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:36.909
Right?
 

00:37:36.909 --> 00:37:41.369
That we have an image how to
change the physical environment

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:42.050
for us.
 

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:46.929
"And what actually matters
is not simply what we produce--

00:37:46.929 --> 00:37:51.186
and this is a very important
idea--"but the mode of

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.597
production,
how we produce,

00:37:53.597 --> 00:37:55.900
how we engage each other.
 

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.885
Because this will change in
history,not simply what we

00:37:59.885 --> 00:38:01.090
produce."
 

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.139
Well this is a revolutionary
idea.

00:38:04.139 --> 00:38:07.000
Again, this is completely new
in Marx.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.945
Before Marx,
you went into a museum and the

00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:13.764
museum was about great people.
 

00:38:13.764 --> 00:38:14.610
Right?
 

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:19.070
These were kings and queens and
generals and popes whose

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:23.451
pictures were presented there,
and this was the way how

00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:25.559
history was described.
 

00:38:25.559 --> 00:38:29.809
Now you go into a history,
and now you can see this is a

00:38:29.809 --> 00:38:32.983
living room,
how people lived in Roman

00:38:32.983 --> 00:38:36.369
times, and this is the way how
they ate,

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:38.980
this is the way how they
cooked, and these are the

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.804
instruments by which they
produced the stuff what they

00:38:41.804 --> 00:38:43.083
cooked in their kitchen.
 

00:38:43.083 --> 00:38:43.670
Right?
 

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.458
This is how a modern historical
museum looks like,

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:51.789
and this comes--this is really
a revolution from Marx.

00:38:51.789 --> 00:38:56.090
History is not the history of
great ideas and great men,

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.420
or great women.
 

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:03.161
History is the idea of the
actual way how people lived and

00:39:03.161 --> 00:39:06.989
produced and reproduced their
ideas.

00:39:06.989 --> 00:39:12.472
Well he said, "Well,
we can distinguish therefore

00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:15.905
differences between nature,
how the productive

00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:17.789
forces"--
he means by

00:39:17.789 --> 00:39:21.150
technology--"is developing
and how"--

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.980
he uses initially the term the
inter--

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.172
"the intercourse,
internal intercourse is

00:39:27.172 --> 00:39:28.380
changing."
 

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.719
And by this he refers to
division of labor.

00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:35.094
A very Smithsian idea,
Adam Smith's idea.

00:39:35.094 --> 00:39:35.768
Right?
 

00:39:35.768 --> 00:39:39.440
That history evolves a greater
division of labor--

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.199
we will see in Emile Durkheim
also this central idea--

00:39:43.199 --> 00:39:46.990
you can see the evolution of
society by increasing division

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:47.710
of labor.
 

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:53.414
And then he tries to come up
with subsequent modes of

00:39:53.414 --> 00:39:54.840
production.
 

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.675
Now he said,
"Now I actually can

00:39:57.675 --> 00:40:01.534
describe the history as
different types of mode of

00:40:01.534 --> 00:40:05.079
production, moving from
elementary forms.

00:40:05.079 --> 00:40:08.590
The most elementary form is
tribal society.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:12.239
In tribal society where the
technology is very simple and

00:40:12.239 --> 00:40:15.369
there is very little division of
labor"--

00:40:15.369 --> 00:40:19.300
he is sexist enough to
say--"there is a natural

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.539
division of labor between men
and women.

00:40:22.539 --> 00:40:27.023
Men go hunting and women go
collecting woods in the

00:40:27.023 --> 00:40:28.369
forest."
 

00:40:28.369 --> 00:40:30.909
And that he calls natural.
 

00:40:30.909 --> 00:40:33.260
This is, of course,
a sexist proposition.

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.657
But, you know,
he was writing it in 1845--was

00:40:38.657 --> 00:40:42.829
not the only man who was sexist.
 

00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:46.155
"Well the second form
is," he said,

00:40:46.155 --> 00:40:50.690
"ancient communal or state
property; antiquity."

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.809
Now you have development of
forces of production,

00:40:53.809 --> 00:40:57.114
and in fact you have a
separation of ownership and

00:40:57.114 --> 00:41:01.157
greater division of labor,
where now people can produce

00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:04.139
more than necessary for their
survival.

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:07.998
Therefore there will be slaves
who will be working day and

00:41:07.998 --> 00:41:11.653
night, and there will be
philosophers who sit in Athens

00:41:11.653 --> 00:41:13.684
and Rome and have great ideas.
 

00:41:13.684 --> 00:41:14.429
Right?
 

00:41:14.429 --> 00:41:17.916
Because the slaves produce the
stuff, what they can eat and

00:41:17.916 --> 00:41:18.940
they can enjoy.
 

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.860
So the division of labor
evolves.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.201
And then the third,
now we have the evolution of

00:41:27.201 --> 00:41:28.309
feudalism.
 

00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:31.735
Well slaves were great,
producing cheap,

00:41:31.735 --> 00:41:37.005
but the problems with slaves
were that they did not have much

00:41:37.005 --> 00:41:41.309
incentive to use very
complicated technology.

00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:45.217
You had to supervise them very
closely because they really

00:41:45.217 --> 00:41:48.027
hated your guts and if they
could they did

00:41:48.027 --> 00:41:50.768
break--right?--the instruments
if t.

00:41:50.768 --> 00:41:54.190
So you did want to give them
complex technologies.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.000
So you invent serfdom.
 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.675
You say, "You know,
why don't you become a serf

00:41:58.675 --> 00:41:59.829
rather than a slave?
 

00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:03.550
You can have your house and
I'll give you a piece of land.

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:08.954
And if you behave yourself,
two days you work on my estate

00:42:08.954 --> 00:42:13.503
and you produce stuff for me,
and I'll let you to spend the

00:42:13.503 --> 00:42:15.960
rest of the week producing for
yourself."

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:22.070
But the big problem is that
with the evolution of feudalism,

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:27.360
the fall of Rome and Greece
and, you know,

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.539
rise of Charlemagne and,
you know, the Dark Middle Ages,

00:42:31.539 --> 00:42:35.268
the division of labor did not
develop.

00:42:35.268 --> 00:42:38.590
There was less division of
labor in the eleventh and

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:42.630
twelfth century than it was in
the first and second century.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:46.639
So the methodology breaks down.
 

00:42:46.639 --> 00:42:48.489
Marx is in deep trouble.
 

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:52.246
And as you can see,
you can read the text,

00:42:52.246 --> 00:42:55.730
he leaves after this the page
blank.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.389
He said, &gt;
 

00:42:57.389 --> 00:42:59.436
, "I'm in trouble."
 

00:42:59.436 --> 00:42:59.929
Right?
 

00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:01.869
"I have to start this all
over again."

00:43:01.869 --> 00:43:05.454
And he starts all over again
and tries to come up with

00:43:05.454 --> 00:43:06.739
something better.
 

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:11.949
Well sociology of knowledge,
a very important contribution.

00:43:11.949 --> 00:43:15.489
This is unfortunately
completely wrong,

00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:18.168
what he's saying,
but the methodology is

00:43:18.168 --> 00:43:22.130
extremely important,
and informed people who were

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.960
studying cognition and knowledge
ever since.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.690
And he makes this very
important suggestion.

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:32.987
"Well life determines
consciousness"

00:43:32.987 --> 00:43:36.329
rather than the other way
around.

00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:39.543
And the other argument,
which I think is desperately

00:43:39.543 --> 00:43:42.088
wrong,
but very insightful:

00:43:42.088 --> 00:43:47.530
"Ruling class always
determines the ruling ideas of

00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:49.610
each people."
 

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:52.420
Now life determines
consciousness.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.846
And this is kind of the
essence--right?--of materialism.

00:43:56.846 --> 00:43:57.489
Right?
 

00:43:57.489 --> 00:44:01.936
"Definite individuals,
who are productively active in

00:44:01.936 --> 00:44:05.445
a definite way,
enter into definite social and

00:44:05.445 --> 00:44:07.630
political relationships.
 

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:13.065
The production of ideas is at
first directly interwoven with

00:44:13.065 --> 00:44:17.489
material activity and the
material intercourse of

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:18.780
man."
 

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:22.472
Tell me, you know,
how much money you have in your

00:44:22.472 --> 00:44:25.938
pocket and I will tell you what
your ideas are,

00:44:25.938 --> 00:44:28.199
to put it very simplistically.
 

00:44:28.199 --> 00:44:29.030
Right?
 

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:34.351
Tell me which class you belong
to and I will be able to tell

00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:36.518
you what your ideas are.
 

00:44:36.518 --> 00:44:37.329
Right?
 

00:44:37.329 --> 00:44:40.617
Well indeed,
you know, there is a strong

00:44:40.617 --> 00:44:43.061
class component,
for instance,

00:44:43.061 --> 00:44:47.056
in voting behavior;
not so much in the United

00:44:47.056 --> 00:44:51.333
States, because in the United
States if you are poor,

00:44:51.333 --> 00:44:53.306
you usually do not vote.
 

00:44:53.306 --> 00:44:54.130
Right?
 

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:57.166
And therefore,
you know, the Democratic Party

00:44:57.166 --> 00:45:01.239
is kind of scrambling to get a
little working class vote;

00:45:01.239 --> 00:45:04.514
more than that,
without scaring the middle

00:45:04.514 --> 00:45:06.670
class away for voting them.
 

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:07.389
Right?
 

00:45:07.389 --> 00:45:12.409
That's the big traditional
trouble of the Democratic Party.

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:16.692
But if you look at Europe or
you look at Australia--the

00:45:16.692 --> 00:45:20.023
Australian Labor Party was
getting a solid,

00:45:20.023 --> 00:45:22.639
you know, working class vote.
 

00:45:22.639 --> 00:45:26.572
So tell me what your class
position is and I will tell you

00:45:26.572 --> 00:45:29.469
how you will vote in the next
elections.

00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:31.090
As I said, in the U.S.
 

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.110
it doesn't work.
 

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:33.340
But it does work in Sweden.
 

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.929
It did work in England for a
long time.

00:45:34.929 --> 00:45:37.594
It, by and large,
worked in Australia.

00:45:37.594 --> 00:45:38.170
Right?
 

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:42.199
If you are--to some extent it
even works in the United States.

00:45:42.199 --> 00:45:46.039
Well there are some very rich
people who are Democrats.

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:49.539
But typically those guys who
are very rich,

00:45:49.539 --> 00:45:52.206
don't they tend to be
Republican?

00:45:52.206 --> 00:45:53.039
Right?
 

00:45:53.039 --> 00:45:55.300
I think they probably do. Right?
 

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:59.360
So, I mean, there is--this is
what Marxists are getting at.

00:45:59.360 --> 00:45:59.920
Right?
 

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:02.474
"Tell me,
you know, what your materialist

00:46:02.474 --> 00:46:06.219
interests are and then I'll tell
you what is on your mind."

00:46:06.219 --> 00:46:08.550
Reductionist.
 

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:11.460
Again we will read Sigmund
Freud.

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:14.030
He said, "Well true."
 

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.670
But this is not only economic
interest.

00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:20.842
"Tell me the history of
your sex life and I'll tell you

00:46:20.842 --> 00:46:22.753
what is on your mind."
 

00:46:22.753 --> 00:46:23.389
Right?
 

00:46:23.389 --> 00:46:27.440
You know, it's an analogous
argument.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.340
Right?
 

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:31.951
It is existence which
determines consciousness.

00:46:31.951 --> 00:46:32.579
Right?
 

00:46:32.579 --> 00:46:34.958
Both of them said,
"Well, it's not

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:38.150
necessarily true,
that what is in your mind true.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.630
But I know where it is coming
from." Right?

00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:43.800
"You were in love with
your mother--

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:47.193
right?--if you were a
man--"and you suppressed

00:46:47.193 --> 00:46:51.009
all your desire for your mother,
and that's why you have

00:46:51.009 --> 00:46:54.199
your--these false ideas in your
mind." Right?

00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:58.590
"Or you were a--you are a
girl and you were loving father.

00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:00.150
You could not fulfill this love.
 

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:03.851
Suppress your desire and you
have all these strange ideas

00:47:03.851 --> 00:47:04.380
there.
 

00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.195
That's why you are neurotic.
 

00:47:06.195 --> 00:47:06.650
Right?
 

00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:07.949
And I can tell you." Right?
 

00:47:07.949 --> 00:47:09.630
That's the way how Marx will
argue it.

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:13.782
Sort of, you know--this is also
reductionist,

00:47:13.782 --> 00:47:15.010
by the way.
 

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.255
But there is a common
interesting idea:

00:47:18.255 --> 00:47:22.186
who we are biologically,
class-wise, race-wise,

00:47:22.186 --> 00:47:25.690
gender-wise,
that makes a difference.

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.630
I see in the discussion
sections.

00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:31.170
Very often--right?--if we have
a real hot topic--

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:35.039
you know, do you want to have
universal healthcare,

00:47:35.039 --> 00:47:37.961
for instance,
well there is usually a gender

00:47:37.961 --> 00:47:39.458
division in the class.
 

00:47:39.458 --> 00:47:40.070
Right?
 

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:43.596
Sort of, you know,
gender has an impact.

00:47:43.596 --> 00:47:44.320
Right?
 

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:47.829
Well speaking about it,
I get into affirmative action.

00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:48.360
Right?
 

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.849
Well of course we are in a
liberal university.

00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:56.159
Few people dare to speak up
against affirmative action.

00:47:56.159 --> 00:48:00.519
But, you know,
among white males well there is

00:48:00.519 --> 00:48:04.688
usually less
articulation--right?--to defend

00:48:04.688 --> 00:48:08.079
the idea of affirmative action.
 

00:48:08.079 --> 00:48:12.139
Woman and minorities are more
likely to defend it.

00:48:12.139 --> 00:48:12.840
Okay?
 

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:17.157
So I know who you are,
I know what your ideas will be.

00:48:17.157 --> 00:48:17.809
Right?
 

00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:21.449
Your interests form your ideas.
 

00:48:21.449 --> 00:48:22.849
That's the idea.
 

00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:25.291
I think this is a very
important idea.

00:48:25.291 --> 00:48:25.820
Right?
 

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.960
Put in a simplistic way.
 

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:33.804
And that comes to the idea that
the ruling class is really

00:48:33.804 --> 00:48:36.268
producing the ruling ideas.
 

00:48:36.268 --> 00:48:39.777
Well not quite true,
but there is an element of

00:48:39.777 --> 00:48:40.693
truth to it.
 

00:48:40.693 --> 00:48:41.380
Right?
 

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:44.639
There is an ideological
hegemony in the world.

00:48:44.639 --> 00:48:50.519
Okay, that's about it for today.
 

00:48:50.519 --> 00:48:52.670
Thank you.
 

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:58.000

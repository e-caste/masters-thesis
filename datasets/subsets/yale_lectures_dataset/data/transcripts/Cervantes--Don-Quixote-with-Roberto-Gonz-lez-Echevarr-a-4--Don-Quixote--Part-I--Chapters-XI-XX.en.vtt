00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.910
Prof: As I said in my
last lecture,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
and as you have already--I'm
sure--seen,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:19.050
the Quixote has two
overarching plots.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.168
One is the story of the mad
hidalgo and his squire,

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:30.920
and the story about the writing
of the novel.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.067
The one about the insane Don
Quixote will acquire coherence

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:39.440
after the fight with the
Biscainer,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.370
as Jarvis calls it in your
translation,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.238
because he and his squire will
now be pursued by the Holy

00:00:48.238 --> 00:00:51.533
Brotherhood--
I'll explain what the Holy

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:55.887
Brotherhood is--
and by the priest and the

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:56.920
barber.
 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.450
His neighbors,
the priest and the barber,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.393
want to return Alonso Quijano
to his home in that unnamed

00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:07.599
village in La Mancha.
 

00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.099
The episode about the lost
manuscript and the search for

00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.736
the balance of the story,
the manuscript found and its

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:20.736
translation,
follow themes mentioned in the

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:24.319
prologue about the book's
authorship.

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:29.423
You will also have noticed how
Cervantes plays with the

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:34.355
divisions of the chapters;
they seem to be arbitrary,

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:37.170
they seem to be very whimsical.
 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.168
These are all winks at the
reader, telling him that this is

00:01:43.168 --> 00:01:48.030
a very artful,
artificial and fictional work.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.132
Obviously, also many of these
divisions were made after the

00:01:53.132 --> 00:01:58.544
manuscript was finished;
scholars have worked on this

00:01:58.544 --> 00:02:01.780
and come to that conclusion.
 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.629
In the context of the business
of finding the manuscript,

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:11.288
and the balance of the story
and all of that,

00:02:11.288 --> 00:02:14.786
one could ask,
who is the second most

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:19.060
important character in the
Quixote?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.580
Is it Sancho?
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.512
I think that it is the
narrator, the narrator and his

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:31.158
various agents who appear
throughout the novel.

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:35.317
That would be,
to my mind, the second most

00:02:35.317 --> 00:02:39.780
important character in the
Quixote.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.250
Now, in this playing with the
manuscript,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.979
and the lost manuscript,
and all of that,

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:53.310
Cervantes is parodying the
romances of chivalry,

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.275
where such devices appear:
Oh!

00:02:56.275 --> 00:03:02.411
This manuscript of this novel
was found in a vault somewhere,

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:06.604
it was written by some sage,
and so forth,

00:03:06.604 --> 00:03:10.490
and Cervantes is parodying
that.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:16.497
Remember, a parody is a mocking
imitation of the style of a

00:03:16.497 --> 00:03:21.883
literary work or works
ridiculing stylistic practices

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:24.680
by exaggerated mimicry.
 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.020
In that sense,
a parody is both a criticism

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.000
and an homage because it is a
copy of something;

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.050
it is a distorted copy,
but it is still a copy.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.764
So the business of the
unfinished manuscript and its

00:03:40.764 --> 00:03:46.221
translation rekindles questions
and issues that the narrator

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:51.515
opened in the prologue,
that prologue that we discussed

00:03:51.515 --> 00:03:53.699
a number of classes ago.
 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:59.964
I will talk a little bit today
about why all of these games of

00:03:59.964 --> 00:04:01.300
authorship.
 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.817
But let us sort of recapitulate
how many texts or virtual texts

00:04:06.817 --> 00:04:08.330
we have so far.
 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.844
We have the original text that
was supposedly written in Arabic

00:04:14.844 --> 00:04:21.149
by a lying Moorish historian
called Cide Hamete Benengeli.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:30.161
The second is the text of the
translation that the narrator

00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:31.870
pays for.
 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:38.036
Then, a further text is the one
that this narrator presumably

00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:43.793
corrects and copies and rewrites
and comments upon in the

00:04:43.793 --> 00:04:47.672
margins,
as you will see in several

00:04:47.672 --> 00:04:50.019
episodes in the future.
 

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:56.137
But what about the manuscript
up to chapter VIII and that

00:04:56.137 --> 00:04:57.339
narrator?
 

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:02.817
We have no idea how the
narrator came about that

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:10.043
manuscript, so the text of those
first eight chapters it is not

00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:13.889
explained where it came from.
 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:21.502
Now, this whole collection of
manuscripts do not make a

00:05:21.502 --> 00:05:25.860
coherent system;
you can't reduce it to a

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.149
coherent system.
 

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:29.089
Yes, we have the first one,
the second one,

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:34.444
the third one;
it all remains vague and a

00:05:34.444 --> 00:05:37.459
mystery,
and besides,

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:43.761
we know that the whole thing is
a joke beginning with the name

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:48.410
Cide Hamete Benengeli or
berenjena.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.550
What's a berenjena?
 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.850
Student: Eggplant.
 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.956
Prof: Eggplant.
 

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:54.815
That is to say,
his last name could be

00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:55.519
'eggplant.'
 

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:58.610
So it is a joke.
 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.047
Now, why are Cervantes and his
narrator establishing this

00:06:02.047 --> 00:06:03.949
distance from their own text?
 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.336
How does this distancing mesh
with the authorial willfulness

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:12.317
we found in that first sentence,
where the narrator says

00:06:12.317 --> 00:06:15.312
"de cuyo nombre quiero
acordarme,"

00:06:15.312 --> 00:06:17.829
the name of which I
purposefully omit,

00:06:17.829 --> 00:06:20.430
referring to the village in La
Mancha,

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.639
where Don Quixote or Alonso
Quijano lives.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.329
It is as if this modern author,
Cervantes,

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:32.086
could not posit his own
existence without radical

00:06:32.086 --> 00:06:34.851
reservations,
self doubts,

00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:39.639
self doubts about himself as
creator.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.863
I have emphasized that this
kind of ironic distancing has

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:49.339
echoes of Montaigne's self
deprecatory irony,

00:06:49.339 --> 00:06:55.129
also echoes of Erasmus's
irony--I have only mentioned

00:06:55.129 --> 00:07:00.826
Erasmus in passing,
the great humanist Erasmus of

00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:04.367
Rotterdam,
who had many followers in Spain

00:07:04.367 --> 00:07:08.625
and who wrote a book that may be
one of the sources of the

00:07:08.625 --> 00:07:13.026
Quixote,
called In Praise of

00:07:13.026 --> 00:07:14.660
Folly.
 

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.834
It's a very,
very ironic book,

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:22.036
it's not praising folly,
it is doing so in a mocking

00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:28.509
way, but it is that sort of
mocking way that you find in

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:30.040
Cervantes.
 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.730
Now, it is as if Cervantes were
removing the origin of the text,

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:45.220
were leaving it in a sort of
cloud of mystery,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:50.810
and that this is part both of
the irony and of the joke.

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:56.415
Remember the quote from
LukÃ¡cs that I read in the

00:07:56.415 --> 00:08:02.632
first lecture about this first
modern novel emerging at a time

00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:07.829
when the Christian God has
abandoned the world.

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:10.990
You do not have the
centeredness that you had in

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.420
the Divine Comedy,
if you have read Dante.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:19.202
In the Divine Comedy
everything coheres because there

00:08:19.202 --> 00:08:23.740
is a cosmological system and
with the attendant symbolism

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.769
provided by the Catholic Church,
by Catholic doctrine,

00:08:28.769 --> 00:08:33.592
and so the self of Dante,
the pilgrim is very much--even

00:08:33.592 --> 00:08:36.250
though he's also like Don
Quixote--

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:41.450
travelling within a coherent
universe,

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.817
and, in fact,
in the very middle of the

00:08:43.817 --> 00:08:46.761
Divine Comedy the central
verse of the Divine

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.610
Comedy alludes to Dante.
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:51.950
So Dante is at the center of
this coherent universe.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.490
This is not the case in the
Quixote, and these authorial

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.250
games underscore that.
 

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:01.000
This is no longer the case.
 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.080
Remember that this is,
as I've been saying,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.750
a post-Copernican world,
a world in which the earth is

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.894
no longer at the center,
therefore, "man,"

00:09:12.894 --> 00:09:16.940
"mankind"
is no longer at the center.

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:23.818
So this is what is at stake,
as it were, in all of these

00:09:23.818 --> 00:09:24.820
games.
 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.110
Again, these are very serious
issues,

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:33.970
but Cervantes always presents
them in a light humorous tone,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:37.440
which is part of the irony
itself, the humor,

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.408
the laughing at one self and
the laughing at others.

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:48.779
So this is a very important
element of the Quixote,

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:56.667
and one that it has in common
with a very famous painting by

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:00.009
Diego VelÃ¡zquez.
 

00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:03.607
Diego VelÃ¡zquez,
the great VelÃ¡zquez

00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:06.620
about whom most of you must have
heard.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.231
And that painting--oh,
oh, it's not very well

00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:15.538
represented;
it's kind of blurry--is Las

00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:18.658
Meninas, The Maids of Honor.
 

00:10:18.658 --> 00:10:22.840
Can we improve a little bit on
the quality of that?

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.909
Maybe if we turn off the lights?
 

00:10:23.909 --> 00:10:30.019
 
 

00:10:30.019 --> 00:10:30.779
Well, that will help, too.
 

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:39.009
 
 

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:39.450
It's out of focus?
 

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:45.789
 
 

00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:47.360
Is it better now?
 

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.600
It's better,
but it's out of focus.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.379
Can it be improved at all?
 

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:53.438
Student:  I can see it
clearly here,

00:10:53.438 --> 00:10:55.769
so I don't know what to say...
 

00:10:55.769 --> 00:10:59.899
Student:  The lens of
the projector might be out of

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:00.480
focus.
 

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.034
Prof: Oh,
but it is way up there,

00:11:02.034 --> 00:11:03.710
so we can't do anything with
it, can we?

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:08.119
So I have brought both my
pointer and, if you will excuse

00:11:08.119 --> 00:11:12.450
me, this little flashlight so I
can look at my notes.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:15.950
I hope it's not distracting to
you.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.532
As I have perhaps mentioned
before, I am a pilot,

00:11:19.532 --> 00:11:22.220
and this is my pilot's
flashlight.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.267
You use it in the cockpit at
night to look at charts and

00:11:26.267 --> 00:11:29.357
stuff like that,
and I thought that I could

00:11:29.357 --> 00:11:31.860
improvise and use it for this.
 

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.019
Now, as you look at the
painting--and I apologize for

00:11:36.019 --> 00:11:40.418
the poor technology and I
promise we will bring a better

00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:44.658
one the next time or maybe I'll
make a copy that I can

00:11:44.658 --> 00:11:46.019
distribute.
 

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:48.894
First of all,
as you look at it,

00:11:48.894 --> 00:11:53.807
think of what I mentioned
before about Alberti's De

00:11:53.807 --> 00:11:57.980
Pictura, the treatise on
perspective.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:02.493
Remember that I talked about
Leon Alberti,

00:12:02.493 --> 00:12:08.326
Leon Battista Alberti,
1404-1472, an Italian who wrote

00:12:08.326 --> 00:12:11.960
this treatise on perspective.
 

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.440
He was an architect and wrote
on architecture,

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:18.788
and I really encourage you to
read this little treaty,

00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:23.267
it's very brief,
but it's very influential

00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:29.928
because he laid down the basis
for perspective in painting.

00:12:29.928 --> 00:12:32.668
As you can see,
we do have perspective here

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:36.581
because of the relative size of
the figures as they move away

00:12:36.581 --> 00:12:37.820
from the front.
 

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:41.308
So I just want you to take that
into account.

00:12:41.308 --> 00:12:45.453
Now, the relevance of Las
Meninas to the

00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:50.105
Quixote is essentially
because of this issue of self

00:12:50.105 --> 00:12:51.460
reflexivity.
 

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.433
In both works,
the creator has been given a

00:12:54.433 --> 00:12:58.894
prominent place within the work
and in both they appear in their

00:12:58.894 --> 00:13:02.720
function as creators of the very
work in question.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.570
That is VelÃ¡zquez.
 

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:10.370
And he is, obviously,
in the act of painting,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.469
as Cervantes appears within
the Quixote in the act of

00:13:15.469 --> 00:13:17.370
writing the novel.
 

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.160
Now, we look at
VelÃ¡zquez who looks a

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.445
little quizzical--
We will speak a little bit more

00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:29.549
about his figureÃ¢â¬âand you
can recall the words of

00:13:29.549 --> 00:13:33.554
Cervantes in the prologue,
when he wrote:

00:13:33.554 --> 00:13:38.256
"I often took pen in hand
and as often laid it down not

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:41.441
knowing what to say,
and once upon a time,

00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:44.470
being in deep suspense with the
paper before me,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.259
the pen behind my ear,
my elbow on the table,

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:52.125
and my cheek on my hand
thinking what I should

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.330
say..."
 

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.260
And you can think of
VelÃ¡zquez poised in a

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.210
similar way,
as if thinking of what to paint

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.303
next,
and also actually comparing his

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:09.528
models--
I'll speak about who the models

00:14:09.528 --> 00:14:13.581
are--
to what he's painting,

00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:23.600
but it's the same moment of
doubt that we have in Cervantes.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.211
It is kind of a visual
aporia--Aporia is

00:14:27.211 --> 00:14:29.870
a rhetorical figure to express
doubt.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.623
A-P-O-R-I-A--and a visual
aporia in that

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:40.615
VelÃ¡zquez seems to be
hesitating what the next brush

00:14:40.615 --> 00:14:42.580
stroke will be.
 

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.393
Now, Las Meninas seems
to capture a moment,

00:14:46.393 --> 00:14:50.830
and not a very significant
moment, and that is significant

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:51.918
in itself.
 

00:14:51.918 --> 00:14:54.470
How do we know that it's not a
very significant moment?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.120
Well, there are certain
gestures, like this little girl

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.625
that just put a foot on the dog;
these figures back here,

00:15:01.625 --> 00:15:04.340
if we could see them more
clearly you could see they're

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.200
engaged in a trivial
conversation.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.230
The princess is being offered,
I think,

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.558
a glass of water of something
by this maid,

00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:19.350
and this man in the back is
about to leave the room,

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.957
so it's an insignificant
moment, it's a moment like those

00:15:22.957 --> 00:15:26.142
in the Quixote,
those many moments that are

00:15:26.142 --> 00:15:28.201
contingent,
serendipitous,

00:15:28.201 --> 00:15:32.668
things just happened,
not in a sequence,

00:15:32.668 --> 00:15:36.565
but just caught,
like a snapshot,

00:15:36.565 --> 00:15:41.943
and that is what is important
about this moment in which

00:15:41.943 --> 00:15:47.030
VelÃ¡zquez and all of
these other people in the

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.769
painting are caught up.
 

00:15:49.769 --> 00:15:55.404
Now, of the painting,
we see only the back of the

00:15:55.404 --> 00:16:01.980
painting, and we see the easel,
the paints, the brush.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.750
That is, we see the instruments
to create the painting,

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:09.033
and, in fact,
we are in VelÃ¡zquez's

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:10.451
studio,
his workshop,

00:16:10.451 --> 00:16:14.226
so VelÃ¡zquez is painting
the inside of the workshop

00:16:14.226 --> 00:16:17.538
within which the work of art is
being created,

00:16:17.538 --> 00:16:23.788
as we read about the manuscript
being copied,

00:16:23.788 --> 00:16:28.280
translated, and so forth,
given the details about the

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.808
composition and the creation of
the novel that we are reading.

00:16:33.808 --> 00:16:41.528
This studio of VelÃ¡zquez
would be akin to Don Quixote's

00:16:41.528 --> 00:16:49.120
library where he keeps the books
that have turned him mad.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.062
Now, the other important
element, and perhaps the most,

00:16:54.062 --> 00:16:58.090
is that the line between
reality and fiction,

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:02.210
between life and art,
has been abolished.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.528
How so?
 

00:17:04.528 --> 00:17:08.078
Well, who is the model of the
painting?

00:17:08.078 --> 00:17:10.548
Well, presumably the king and
queen,

00:17:10.548 --> 00:17:14.868
who are reflected on the back
on that mirror,

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:19.240
but the models are truly
ourselves as we position

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.608
ourselves in front of the
painting.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:27.035
In fact, the first time I saw
this painting many years ago in

00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:30.673
1969 to be exact--
now it's in a large room and

00:17:30.673 --> 00:17:34.923
you can barely get to see the
painting there are so many

00:17:34.923 --> 00:17:39.251
tourists looking at it and
guides talking about it and so

00:17:39.251 --> 00:17:42.074
forth--
but when I saw it in 1969 at El

00:17:42.074 --> 00:17:45.816
Prado Museum it was in a room--
the painting is much larger

00:17:45.816 --> 00:17:49.957
than what you see here--
it was in a room for itself,

00:17:49.957 --> 00:17:55.200
and the dimensions of the room
and the way that the painting

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.108
was positioned the moment you
walked in,

00:17:59.108 --> 00:18:03.490
you walked into the painting,
you became the model.

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:08.108
It was really uncanny the
sensation that you had,

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:12.509
you really had the sense that
you had walked into the painting

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:15.538
and you had become the painter's
model,

00:18:15.538 --> 00:18:20.210
you had become that which he
was in the process of painting.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:24.592
So here we are,
becoming the model and there is

00:18:24.592 --> 00:18:28.690
VelÃ¡zquez within his own
painting.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:32.541
He was a genius,
vain, a little lazy,

00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:33.720
boastful.
 

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.920
He's wearing the cross--I think
it's of Calatrava--one of the

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.180
military orders.
 

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:44.358
You didn't become a member of
the Calatrava just like that,

00:18:44.358 --> 00:18:48.108
so he's a bit boastful,
and there he is.

00:18:48.108 --> 00:18:56.748
Now, all of the self-reflexive
moves that we've seen in the

00:18:56.748 --> 00:19:01.278
Quixote are the same here.
 

00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:05.634
We see the painting as it were
from behind, we see the

00:19:05.634 --> 00:19:10.400
preparation of the painting but
not the painting itself.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:16.161
My late friend Severo Sarduy
said that Las Meninas was

00:19:16.161 --> 00:19:20.288
within Las Meninas but
backwards,

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:25.118
the same way that in the Arabic
manuscript of the Quixote,

00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:27.180
presumably the
Quixote is backwards,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.808
because of course you write
Arabic the other way--

00:19:29.808 --> 00:19:31.940
It's a little bit too clever,
perhaps,

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.900
but you get the idea that the
painting is within the painting,

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:41.965
but you're not seeing the
painting but how the painting

00:19:41.965 --> 00:19:43.279
comes about.
 

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:49.215
We also have the issue of the
multiple perspectives,

00:19:49.215 --> 00:19:52.009
none of them complete.
 

00:19:52.009 --> 00:19:56.173
That is, VelÃ¡zquez can
see us, can see the model,

00:19:56.173 --> 00:19:58.900
he can see the rest of his
studio.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:05.970
The man in the back is the one
with the most complete view,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:10.118
because he can see the painting
and he can see the model,

00:20:10.118 --> 00:20:13.848
if indeed the models are the
king and queen.

00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:18.588
So, ironically,
it is that man who is at that

00:20:18.588 --> 00:20:22.788
point who has the most complete
view.

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:27.141
I say ironically because I
detect a pun on

00:20:27.141 --> 00:20:32.980
VelÃ¡zquez's part in that
figure because that,

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.077
in terms of perspective,
is more or less about the

00:20:37.077 --> 00:20:40.714
point de fuite,
in French, the vanishing point,

00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:42.608
the punto de fuga in
Spanish,

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:46.570
that is, point at the center
and the depth of the

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.375
perspective,
that is, the vanishing point,

00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:54.576
and, ironically,
in that punto de fuga is

00:20:54.576 --> 00:20:57.603
a man about to leave,
there is, I think,

00:20:57.603 --> 00:21:01.095
a pun involved there--
or perhaps I am being just too

00:21:01.095 --> 00:21:03.190
clever like my friend Sarduy.
 

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.848
But the idea is that no one has
a complete perspective;

00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:12.914
everything, everybody has a
partial, incomplete perspective,

00:21:12.914 --> 00:21:14.890
including the artist.
 

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:21.202
And this is fundamental because
it makes for this ironic

00:21:21.202 --> 00:21:23.269
incomplete view.
 

00:21:23.269 --> 00:21:29.705
Remember, the greatest part of
the irony in Cervantes is that

00:21:29.705 --> 00:21:35.500
we only have a partial view of
this infinite world,

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.068
this post-Copernican,
now Galileo world--

00:21:39.068 --> 00:21:42.390
Galileo who wrote around the
same time,

00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:45.230
and Galileo discovered the use
of the telescope,

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:49.827
he discovered the infinite
spaces--So our perspective is

00:21:49.827 --> 00:21:51.250
always limited.
 

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:57.040
So in The Meninas
the perspectives are all

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.095
limited, partial,
and in that,

00:22:00.095 --> 00:22:04.940
too, the painting and the novel
are alike.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.896
Now, Galileo--I think,
I quoted him in an earlier

00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:10.298
lecture, if not I'll quote him
again.

00:22:10.298 --> 00:22:12.058
He said: "The more we
know,

00:22:12.058 --> 00:22:15.693
the less we know,"
because he was discovering more

00:22:15.693 --> 00:22:18.602
stars,
more space, and he knew then

00:22:18.602 --> 00:22:23.288
that it would be impossible to
get to know all of space.

00:22:23.288 --> 00:22:26.676
We're still in that situation
although we have improved our

00:22:26.676 --> 00:22:27.318
capacity.
 

00:22:27.318 --> 00:22:34.808
So what is the significance of
all of this?

00:22:34.808 --> 00:22:40.925
What I have just said,
I mean the limits of human

00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:48.190
knowledge, the limits of self
knowledge, and what else?

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:51.192
We are the models,
we are the models of the

00:22:51.192 --> 00:22:54.452
painting,
and VelÃ¡zquez has given

00:22:54.452 --> 00:22:59.096
himself a prominent position in
a painting that should be a

00:22:59.096 --> 00:23:05.506
painting of the king and queen,
so he has usurped the place of

00:23:05.506 --> 00:23:07.910
the king and queen.
 

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:10.838
He has given himself a more
prominent position.

00:23:10.838 --> 00:23:13.298
He has, as it were,
erased them to put himself.

00:23:13.298 --> 00:23:20.647
This is this ambivalent
position of the modern writer,

00:23:20.647 --> 00:23:27.026
or author, or painter,
or artist, about his own

00:23:27.026 --> 00:23:29.798
creative powers.
 

00:23:29.798 --> 00:23:35.644
But he has put himself in the
painting instead of those who

00:23:35.644 --> 00:23:39.980
should be the models,
the king and queen.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.105
Furthermore,
he has opened the space of the

00:23:44.105 --> 00:23:48.036
model so that we,
as we see the painting,

00:23:48.036 --> 00:23:53.440
actually occupy the position of
the king and queen.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.410
This has all kinds of political
implications,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:00.068
you see, the king and queen
have been removed,

00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:04.454
and we, who are commoners,
can occupy instead that

00:24:04.454 --> 00:24:07.480
position,
so in that sense this is a very

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.990
revolutionary painting.
 

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:13.140
This painting is saying:
anybody can be king and queen;

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.480
by just stepping in front of my
painting and becoming my model,

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.259
you become king and queen for
that moment--

00:24:21.259 --> 00:24:24.410
Remember, there was a show
called 'Queen for a Day,' you

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:26.930
become queen for a day or king
for a day,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:33.842
you understand--So there has
been a displacement of power

00:24:33.842 --> 00:24:39.160
here,
in VelÃ¡zquez's painting,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.327
by omitting the king and queen
or by relegating them to the

00:24:44.327 --> 00:24:46.554
back,
to a reflection,

00:24:46.554 --> 00:24:51.382
a very kind of blurry
reflection made more blurry by

00:24:51.382 --> 00:24:56.108
our poor copy here,
of the king and queen.

00:24:56.108 --> 00:24:59.920
So now, historically,
if you will read your Elliott,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.701
you will see that this reflects
a real political situation in

00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:05.461
Spain,
meaning that,

00:25:05.461 --> 00:25:10.599
in fact, the power of the
monarchy has been diminished.

00:25:10.599 --> 00:25:13.960
This painting is from 1656.
 

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.259
Remember, it's later than
the Quixote,

00:25:17.259 --> 00:25:21.490
but history didn't move that
fast in the period,

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.250
so 1605 first Quixote,
1656,

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.405
fifty years give or take,
but by the seventeenth century

00:25:28.405 --> 00:25:30.759
the Spanish monarchy has been
weakened.

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:36.950
It is in the hands of
validos,

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:42.500
noblemen who occupied positions
of power,

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:52.006
and the Hapsburgs were very
disinterested in governance and

00:25:52.006 --> 00:25:57.578
more in luxury,
and all of that.

00:25:57.578 --> 00:26:00.541
VelÃ¡zquez painted the
Hapsburgs in some of those

00:26:00.541 --> 00:26:02.375
activities,
hunting, and stuff like that,

00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:04.582
but here,
in this painting he has

00:26:04.582 --> 00:26:08.108
eliminated them from the
position of power,

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:09.920
he has placed himself at the
center,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.750
and he has allowed us commoners
to occupy that position.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.058
So this is the significance.
 

00:26:17.058 --> 00:26:23.287
Now, the most important
parallel to this will come in

00:26:23.287 --> 00:26:31.038
Part II of the Quixote,
but I will anticipate it here,

00:26:31.038 --> 00:26:37.880
when Sancho Panza is made
governor of a mock island,

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.838
and Sancho, by the way,
performs well as a ruler.

00:26:44.838 --> 00:26:49.743
So he, the commoner,
has come to occupy the position

00:26:49.743 --> 00:26:55.417
of ruler, and this is something
similar to what is happening

00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:58.400
here in Las Meninas.
 

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:05.241
So this is why this painting is
so important in relation to

00:27:05.241 --> 00:27:07.720
the Quixote.
 

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.037
But I also want you too,
in anticipation,

00:27:12.037 --> 00:27:15.058
look at this figure,
here.

00:27:15.058 --> 00:27:21.990
The kings of Spain,
like many others,

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:27.618
including Aztec emperors,
kept freaks in their court for

00:27:27.618 --> 00:27:32.019
entertainment and for amusement
midgets,

00:27:32.019 --> 00:27:34.890
people deformed,
and all of that.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.700
Of course, this is,
from our perspective,

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.220
horrendous, but it was
practiced all over,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:46.990
and VelÃ¡zquez was
fascinated by people who had

00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:51.430
peculiar features,
irregular features.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:57.532
He painted midgets and so
forth, and this is obviously a

00:27:57.532 --> 00:27:59.420
deformed woman.
 

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:05.154
I think that she is important
because Cervantes too was very

00:28:05.154 --> 00:28:10.210
much interested in depicting
strange individuals,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.365
individuals who are not
beautiful, but who have been

00:28:15.365 --> 00:28:22.930
scarred by time and by life,
and by bad luck, and so forth.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.618
So when you get to the chapter
in the inn,

00:28:26.618 --> 00:28:29.660
and you read the descriptions
of Maritornes,

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:36.602
the wenchy prostitute who
creates that whole fracas at

00:28:36.602 --> 00:28:44.199
night in the inn think of the
face of this figure here flat

00:28:44.199 --> 00:28:47.660
faced,
deformed, and so forth,

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:51.000
because it's another
correspondence,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.358
a very important
correspondence,

00:28:53.358 --> 00:28:57.317
between VelÃ¡zquez's
aesthetics and Cervantes's

00:28:57.317 --> 00:28:58.460
aesthetics.
 

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:02.088
So much for now for Las
Meninas.

00:29:02.088 --> 00:29:04.288
We will go back to
VelÃ¡zquez later,

00:29:04.288 --> 00:29:08.775
quite soon, as a matter of
fact, to look at another one of

00:29:08.775 --> 00:29:11.127
his masterpieces,
but for now,

00:29:11.127 --> 00:29:16.132
so much for Las Meninas,
so we will go back to having

00:29:16.132 --> 00:29:16.950
light,
 

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:24.890
 
 

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.480
both artificial and a little
bit of natural light.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:51.170
 
 

00:29:51.170 --> 00:30:00.630
The one thing that I failed to
mention is that,

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:03.400
as you notice,
in looking at the painting,

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.741
VelÃ¡zquez has given
himself an important position

00:30:06.741 --> 00:30:10.287
within the painting,
but it's not a central

00:30:10.287 --> 00:30:14.289
position, he is in an oblique
position,

00:30:14.289 --> 00:30:17.759
as it were, a lateral position.
 

00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:23.711
This emphasizes his ambiguity
of the power of creation of the

00:30:23.711 --> 00:30:28.970
modern author and at the same
time the self doubt,

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:36.068
the self doubt that the self
reflexivity expresses.

00:30:36.068 --> 00:30:40.641
So it is, I think,
noteworthy that he is on the

00:30:40.641 --> 00:30:47.356
side as it were,
and the creator is looking

00:30:47.356 --> 00:30:54.897
obliquely at the model,
in the same way that Cervantes

00:30:54.897 --> 00:30:59.730
says that he is father or
stepfather of his work.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:05.416
Remember, what he said in the
1605 prologue that we talked

00:31:05.416 --> 00:31:09.108
about in one of the first
classes,

00:31:09.108 --> 00:31:12.303
the obliqueness of
VelÃ¡zquez's position

00:31:12.303 --> 00:31:16.559
within the painting is similar
to that obliqueness of whether

00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:20.009
he's father or stepfather,
and so forth.

00:31:20.009 --> 00:31:27.650
So we go back now to the
Quixote.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:35.346
Now, after the episode with the
Biscainer, the Basque,

00:31:35.346 --> 00:31:42.172
when Don Quixote injures this
man in this fight,

00:31:42.172 --> 00:31:46.818
Sancho is very apprehensive.
 

00:31:46.818 --> 00:31:51.483
He is sure that they're now
going to be pursued by the Holy

00:31:51.483 --> 00:31:52.608
Brotherhood.
 

00:31:52.608 --> 00:31:59.098
They, Don Quixote and Sancho,
move in a world of alienation,

00:31:59.098 --> 00:32:06.070
of madness, of unsociability
and how can society deal with

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:10.720
Don Quixote's madness,
real society.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:18.106
Now, this issue is highlighted
by the presence of civil law in

00:32:18.106 --> 00:32:19.440
the book.
 

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:24.047
Sancho knows that they're being
pursued by the Santa Hermandad,

00:32:24.047 --> 00:32:28.058
and who was the Santa Hermandad
or Holy Brotherhood?

00:32:28.058 --> 00:32:31.224
This was a vigilante police
force that the Catholic kings

00:32:31.224 --> 00:32:34.391
had created, Ferdinand and
Isabella, if you remember your

00:32:34.391 --> 00:32:35.068
Elliott.
 

00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:35.635
Why?
 

00:32:35.635 --> 00:32:44.141
Remember they invested a lot of
effort in trying to unify the

00:32:44.141 --> 00:32:49.041
Spanish peninsula,
but, as I've mentioned,

00:32:49.041 --> 00:32:53.535
Spain is divided in several
regions with different cultures

00:32:53.535 --> 00:32:57.098
and languages and exemptions
from the law,

00:32:57.098 --> 00:33:00.471
where royal authority,
just like the federal law in

00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:03.509
this country,
could not reach because of

00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:06.598
those exemptions that these
regions had.

00:33:06.598 --> 00:33:12.761
Therefore, the Catholic kings
created a police that could go

00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:17.567
through those regional
boundaries and apprehend

00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:19.028
fugitives.
 

00:33:19.028 --> 00:33:24.491
The Holy Brotherhood was in
charge of the roads because the

00:33:24.491 --> 00:33:28.730
roads were under the purview of
the crown,

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:35.605
and they were parallel to
another institution that the

00:33:35.605 --> 00:33:43.144
Catholic kings created,
that also could police all of

00:33:43.144 --> 00:33:48.460
the peninsula;
the Holy Inquisition.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.838
The Inquisition could police
regions other than Castile;

00:33:53.838 --> 00:33:56.085
that is Galicia,
the Basque countries,

00:33:56.085 --> 00:33:58.147
and so forth,
and so could the Holy

00:33:58.147 --> 00:33:59.118
Brotherhood.
 

00:33:59.118 --> 00:34:02.516
The Holy Brotherhood were
feared because they could not

00:34:02.516 --> 00:34:06.987
only apprehend you,
but try you and execute you on

00:34:06.987 --> 00:34:10.494
the spot,
and Sancho says that he all

00:34:10.494 --> 00:34:14.539
ready hears their arrows buzzing
in his ears.

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:14.791
Why?
 

00:34:14.791 --> 00:34:18.067
Because Sancho is vulnerable to
the Holy Brotherhood,

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:20.208
whereas Don Quixote,
as an hidalgo,

00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:22.980
feels that he's protected from
the law.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.489
So Sancho is the one,
if you will notice,

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:30.530
who insists that they are being
pursued by the Holy Brotherhood,

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.599
and that they have to hide in
the hills,

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:36.039
and so forth.
 

00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:41.715
The Holy Brotherhood--sorry to
give away the plot--will

00:34:41.715 --> 00:34:47.918
eventually apprehend them but
let them go at the end of Part

00:34:47.918 --> 00:34:48.550
I.
 

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:53.824
Now, the members of the Holy
Brotherhood were just ordinary

00:34:53.824 --> 00:34:58.099
people who were engaged in this
police force.

00:34:58.099 --> 00:35:03.733
So we move now to the adventure
with the goat herds and the

00:35:03.733 --> 00:35:09.074
speech on the golden age,
that is one of the more famous

00:35:09.074 --> 00:35:11.309
episodes of Part I.
 

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:17.619
Now, this is an episode like
others,

00:35:17.619 --> 00:35:21.677
in which a contrast is
established between what Don

00:35:21.677 --> 00:35:26.304
Quixote has in his head from
having read so many books and

00:35:26.304 --> 00:35:28.739
the real world around him.
 

00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:33.556
He thinks that these goatherds
are like shepherds of the

00:35:33.556 --> 00:35:37.358
classical tradition,
and this is what makes him

00:35:37.358 --> 00:35:41.280
think of the golden age when
there is now mine or thou,

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.460
there is no private property,
there is only goodness,

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:48.282
and man lives at one with
nature, and he delivers this

00:35:48.282 --> 00:35:52.896
beautiful speech which is filled
with all kinds of clichÃ©s

00:35:52.896 --> 00:35:56.719
from the classical tradition to
these goatherds,

00:35:56.719 --> 00:36:00.268
who don't understand what he is
talking about at all.

00:36:00.268 --> 00:36:11.690
What is the connecting thread
between that idealized reality,

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:16.130
that idealized world in Don
Quixote's head,

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:20.907
and the reality of these
goatherds who are listening to

00:36:20.907 --> 00:36:26.126
the speech and not understanding
a thing that Don Quixote is

00:36:26.126 --> 00:36:27.099
saying?
 

00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:31.677
The one thing that connects the
two--and it goes back to one of

00:36:31.677 --> 00:36:35.369
the points that I've made
before--is the goatherds'

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:36.329
kindness.
 

00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:39.449
They are kind.
 

00:36:39.449 --> 00:36:43.152
That is, that which has not
changed from those classical

00:36:43.152 --> 00:36:47.260
idealized times and the present,
is the kindness of people.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:52.181
And remember that I said that
Cervantes likes to depict people

00:36:52.181 --> 00:36:56.860
from the lowest classes being
kind to each other and to Don

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.829
Quixote.
 

00:36:57.829 --> 00:37:01.710
They have not reacted to Don
Quixote's appearance,

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:04.340
which is striking,
to say the least,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:09.753
for this man to suddenly show
up dressed in armor and speaking

00:37:09.753 --> 00:37:12.385
this way,
and they have allowed him to

00:37:12.385 --> 00:37:15.184
sit with them,
to share their food and their

00:37:15.184 --> 00:37:19.931
drink,
and to be involved in their

00:37:19.931 --> 00:37:23.469
life;
so there is a sharp contrast,

00:37:23.469 --> 00:37:28.596
but also a commonality here,
the people, the goatherds are

00:37:28.596 --> 00:37:33.300
kind to Don Quixote and allow
him to be what he wants,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.605
even if they did not understand
what it is that he is talking

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:38.179
about.
 

00:37:38.179 --> 00:37:44.605
Now, this is the first of
several post-prandial speeches

00:37:44.605 --> 00:37:47.409
in the Quixote.
 

00:37:47.409 --> 00:37:51.652
This is another one of these
words that I'm going to teach

00:37:51.652 --> 00:37:56.043
you in this class so that you
can be very pedantic Yalies in

00:37:56.043 --> 00:38:01.601
the present and in the future,
post-prandial simply means an

00:38:01.601 --> 00:38:03.739
after dinner speech.
 

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:10.811
So, what is the significance of
these post-prandial speeches and

00:38:10.811 --> 00:38:18.110
what do they have to do with the
theme of Don Quixote's speech?

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:24.110
Well, after dinner speeches
celebrate the defeat of the

00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:27.943
world,
that is, of animals and plants,

00:38:27.943 --> 00:38:32.286
and end of work,
and there having been turned,

00:38:32.286 --> 00:38:35.170
plants and animals,
into food.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.800
Here they're eating some meet,
they're drinking some wine,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:42.079
which is like the blood of the
earth,

00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:46.039
they're passing the wine
around, and they are enjoying

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:49.849
the fruits of their labor at the
end of the day,

00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:52.650
they're celebrating the end of
work and rest.

00:38:52.650 --> 00:38:56.150
And there is a connection,
of course,

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:58.880
between the eating,
and the talking,

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:02.005
and the speech,
oral activities,

00:39:02.005 --> 00:39:07.106
both pleasurable activities,
so this is the connection

00:39:07.106 --> 00:39:10.190
between these post-prandial
speeches,

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:14.510
between the food and the
speaking, in others there will

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.630
be much more merriment and so
forth,

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:25.320
but this is a reoccurring theme
in the Quixote.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:29.018
There is a great deal about
food in Don Quixote,

00:39:29.018 --> 00:39:34.179
and in some cases food and
language actually coalesce,

00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:43.413
most memorably when Don Quixote
and Sancho vomit on each other

00:39:43.413 --> 00:39:50.932
after the episode of the sheep,
when they vomit on each other,

00:39:50.932 --> 00:39:55.282
and it is as if food and
language have come one and they

00:39:55.282 --> 00:39:59.159
have a dialogue between them:
I vomit on you,

00:39:59.159 --> 00:40:01.202
and you vomit on me,
and that is a form of

00:40:01.202 --> 00:40:05.237
dialogue--
I know it's not very palatable

00:40:05.237 --> 00:40:09.889
to think about that,
especially if you just had

00:40:09.889 --> 00:40:14.233
lunch--but this is the
significance here of speech and

00:40:14.233 --> 00:40:14.889
food.
 

00:40:14.889 --> 00:40:21.018
But the most significant part,
of course,

00:40:21.018 --> 00:40:24.809
is the contrast between Don
Quixote's ideas and

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:29.835
clichÃ©s drawn from the
classical tradition and the real

00:40:29.835 --> 00:40:33.050
every day life of these
goatherds,

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:38.543
who also serve as a transition
towards the Marcela and

00:40:38.543 --> 00:40:46.619
GrisÃ³stomo episode,
in which the whole theme of the

00:40:46.619 --> 00:40:52.666
pastoral will be taken up at,
you could say,

00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:54.409
a higher literary level.
 

00:40:54.409 --> 00:40:58.382
The stakes are much higher in
the GrisÃ³stomo and

00:40:58.382 --> 00:41:03.025
Marcela episode because,
of course, the death has

00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:07.340
occurred and there is a real
conflict.

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:11.018
So I think that the transition
here is smooth.

00:41:11.018 --> 00:41:13.570
The transition is made smoother
by the figure of Vivaldo,

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.900
who--I'm sure you
remember--who's the man with

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.266
whom Don Quixote engages in
conversation about the nature of

00:41:21.266 --> 00:41:23.429
knighthood,
and so forth,

00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:27.150
and they all anticipate,
because they have been told by

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:28.918
the goatherds,
and so forth,

00:41:28.918 --> 00:41:32.869
about this conflict involving
the death of GrisÃ³stomo.

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:40.755
So we move to that episode in
which the main theme appears to

00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:43.780
be that of free will.
 

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:49.599
The theme of free will is the
main theme,

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:53.969
but unattendant,
a very important theme is also

00:41:53.969 --> 00:41:56.431
that,
again, of literature,

00:41:56.431 --> 00:42:00.617
literature and its effects,
because Marcela and

00:42:00.617 --> 00:42:06.128
GrisÃ³stomo are figures
that are counterparts to Don

00:42:06.128 --> 00:42:10.768
Quixote in their relationship to
literature,

00:42:10.768 --> 00:42:13.900
because both Marcela and
GrisÃ³stomo--

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:18.690
but mostly Marcela--want to
play act a literary role.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.980
She wants to be a shepherdess
and take to the hills,

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.869
and of course,
GrisÃ³stomo does the same

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:30.309
to pursue her,
but also GrisÃ³stomo,

00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:35.829
and in this he is also like Don
Quixote, is a reader;

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:38.905
not only a reader,
he's a student from the

00:42:38.905 --> 00:42:41.983
University of Salamanca,
a former student,

00:42:41.983 --> 00:42:44.010
a graduate, and a poet.
 

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:48.126
So the stakes here,
as I say, I repeat are much

00:42:48.126 --> 00:42:53.320
higher, and it is almost as if
literature were on trial.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.400
We can remember what the scene
is.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.289
GrisÃ³stomo has committed
suicide.

00:43:00.289 --> 00:43:05.715
It is not said straight
forwardly because suicide is a

00:43:05.715 --> 00:43:09.793
mortal sin,
and Cervantes is writing within

00:43:09.793 --> 00:43:14.913
the context of very Catholic
Spain and he can't just write it

00:43:14.913 --> 00:43:19.518
directly that GrisÃ³stomo
committed suicide,

00:43:19.518 --> 00:43:23.206
but the words used in the text,
'desesperado,' he became

00:43:23.206 --> 00:43:25.271
desperate,
he was desperate,

00:43:25.271 --> 00:43:29.380
all point out to the fact that
he committed suicide,

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.659
he committed suicide because
Marcela spurned him.

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:41.248
But what is amazing here is the
very detailed socioeconomic

00:43:41.248 --> 00:43:44.518
context of the episode.
 

00:43:44.518 --> 00:43:48.251
In this sense,
Cervantes is anticipating

00:43:48.251 --> 00:43:51.173
Balzac,
the great nineteenth century

00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:56.550
French novelist who gave very,
very specific details about the

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.389
economic situation of his
characters.

00:44:00.389 --> 00:44:06.123
And here we have that,
because we learn that Marcela

00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:10.652
is very rich;
she's the daughter of William

00:44:10.652 --> 00:44:14.201
the Rich,
her mother died giving birth to

00:44:14.201 --> 00:44:18.021
her,
and then William the Rich died

00:44:18.021 --> 00:44:22.590
and left Marcela entrusted to an
uncle--

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:24.313
to a brother,
I guess, of his--who's a

00:44:24.313 --> 00:44:27.427
priest,
and who will administer her

00:44:27.427 --> 00:44:30.469
estate until she gets married.
 

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:36.724
Women could not hold property
out right, and the moment that

00:44:36.724 --> 00:44:42.659
she married the estate would
pass over to her husband.

00:44:42.659 --> 00:44:45.222
In the case of
GrisÃ³stomo,

00:44:45.222 --> 00:44:49.469
who is no longer a youth,
as we will meet later in the

00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:51.590
book;
he's all ready thirty years old

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:54.650
when he dies because,
when Don Quixote leans over to

00:44:54.650 --> 00:44:59.608
look at the cadaver he says,
"I saw a man of about

00:44:59.608 --> 00:45:01.190
thirty."
 

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.750
GrisÃ³stomo is also rich.
 

00:45:04.750 --> 00:45:11.375
He has inherited a great deal
of property and lands and

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:17.755
animals and so forth,
and so it seems as if this were

00:45:17.755 --> 00:45:20.210
a perfect match.
 

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:23.840
He is of noble lineage.
 

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:29.009
She's not, but this would not
be an impediment and it would

00:45:29.009 --> 00:45:34.445
not bring down the line as it
were because nobility was passed

00:45:34.445 --> 00:45:38.190
on in Castilian laws through the
male.

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.248
So Cervantes has created a
situation here for a perfect

00:45:42.248 --> 00:45:47.552
marriage in a small village,
these two rich young people

00:45:47.552 --> 00:45:52.510
would marry and create a larger
even estate.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:56.833
It could become a
mayorazgo--a word that

00:45:56.833 --> 00:46:02.659
you will learn about a little
more later--an entailed state.

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:08.159
Now, what intervenes?
 

00:46:08.159 --> 00:46:13.057
What intervenes is Marcela's
desire to become a shepherd,

00:46:13.057 --> 00:46:17.956
to spurn all of her many
suitors, and GrisÃ³stomo's

00:46:17.956 --> 00:46:19.969
mad pursuit of her.
 

00:46:19.969 --> 00:46:27.409
GrisÃ³stomo is a poet.
 

00:46:27.409 --> 00:46:32.813
We learn that because his poem
is read at the funeral,

00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:36.690
a typical Petrarchan
canzone.

00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:40.949
He is also the one who writes
the autos sacramentales,

00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:44.070
the allegorical plays on Corpus
Christi day,

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:49.429
so he did a religious play that
relates about the Eucharist.

00:46:49.429 --> 00:46:53.315
He's a cosmographer,
he can tell what the weather is

00:46:53.315 --> 00:46:56.670
going to be or the future and
all of that.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:47:01.594
He's a kind of a budding
Faust--Goethe Faust,

00:47:01.594 --> 00:47:07.197
in the nineteenth century--in
that he wants to foretell the

00:47:07.197 --> 00:47:08.260
future.
 

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.771
He's madly in love,
he's a poet,

00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:15.469
he has all of these qualities,
all of these sort-of-demonic

00:47:15.469 --> 00:47:20.170
qualities that lead him to
desperation and to suicide.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:29.172
In fact, he wants to be so much
in control that he has prepared

00:47:29.172 --> 00:47:37.449
his burial in such a way that it
is almost like a play.

00:47:37.449 --> 00:47:42.193
He wants to be buried where he
met Marcela, not in consecrated

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:46.782
ground, all of this raises the
eyebrows of the church in the

00:47:46.782 --> 00:47:48.960
town, the narrator says.
 

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:55.166
His whole burial and funeral is
going to be like an auto

00:47:55.166 --> 00:47:58.423
sacramental,
like one of these plays that he

00:47:58.423 --> 00:48:00.614
wrote,
and his body would be the main

00:48:00.614 --> 00:48:02.239
prop and the protagonist.
 

00:48:02.239 --> 00:48:07.650
So we see other characteristics
of these characters.

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:14.592
Meanwhile, Marcela appears at
the funeral and delivers a very

00:48:14.592 --> 00:48:20.688
spirited defense of herself,
using very precise forensic

00:48:20.688 --> 00:48:23.295
rhetoric,
that is legal rhetoric and

00:48:23.295 --> 00:48:28.213
legal terms to defend herself,
and the issue becomes who is

00:48:28.213 --> 00:48:30.119
right at the end.
 

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:35.597
The women characters in
Cervantes are very active and

00:48:35.597 --> 00:48:40.759
want to take their own destiny
in their own hands,

00:48:40.759 --> 00:48:43.920
and Marcela is an example.
 

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.882
So one could say Marcela is
right, and this is what Don

00:48:46.882 --> 00:48:49.956
Quixote determines,
Don Quixote acts as a judge and

00:48:49.956 --> 00:48:52.277
he says: Wait,
because when she leaves and

00:48:52.277 --> 00:48:54.690
runs into the hills people want
to pursue her,

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.199
he says, no,
no, no, no; he says:

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.039
I will defend her right to be
free.,

00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:03.260
she has proven beyond any doubt
that she had no culpability

00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.489
whatsoever in the fate of
GrisÃ³stomo,

00:49:07.489 --> 00:49:09.809
and so she should be free.
 

00:49:09.809 --> 00:49:13.079
So, is she right?
 

00:49:13.079 --> 00:49:16.692
Is she right,
or has Marcela also acted with

00:49:16.692 --> 00:49:21.144
a somewhat selfishness by
wanting to become a literary

00:49:21.144 --> 00:49:22.489
shepherdess?
 

00:49:22.489 --> 00:49:25.530
To go around in the woods and
playing at being a shepherdess,

00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:28.929
not marrying,
these two have squandered--

00:49:28.929 --> 00:49:31.070
their estates--have squandered
this possibility...

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:35.320
Well, it is not as clear as it
would seem.

00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:39.610
The question,
I think, remains open.

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.610
GrisÃ³stomo has died,
he has killed himself.

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:48.510
Marcela has sort of suffered a
civil death,

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.900
a civil death in the sense that
she has run into the woods,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.925
into the hills,
into the thickest parts of the

00:49:54.925 --> 00:49:56.621
hills,
the text says,

00:49:56.621 --> 00:50:01.461
and we don't know what's going
to become of her there separated

00:50:01.461 --> 00:50:04.579
from society,
playing this literary role.

00:50:04.579 --> 00:50:10.867
And so, I think,
the end of the episode leaves

00:50:10.867 --> 00:50:16.623
us with a sense of ambiguity,
we have to decide,

00:50:16.623 --> 00:50:19.050
as we did in the Andres
episode,

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:23.130
before but it's not clear as it
seems.

00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:29.300
It also seems that the episode
is inviting us to consider the

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.768
effects of literature.
 

00:50:31.768 --> 00:50:35.090
That is, literature has given
Marcela,

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.170
and also in a sense
GrisÃ³stomo,

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:41.349
the idea that absolute freedom
is possible,

00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:46.246
that you can live your dreams,
that you can live out your

00:50:46.246 --> 00:50:50.291
desires,
and obviously this is a

00:50:50.291 --> 00:50:58.195
dangerous proposition which can
lead to the kind of conflict

00:50:58.195 --> 00:51:01.010
that we have here.
 

00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:05.699
Remember, the one passing
judgment at the end is a madman.

00:51:05.699 --> 00:51:09.577
Don Quixote has passed judgment
because, in a way,

00:51:09.577 --> 00:51:13.849
he is like Marcela and he
defends Marcela's right to be

00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:16.619
insane like him and to act out.
 

00:51:16.619 --> 00:51:19.789
Now, this whole episode,
in a way,

00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:25.400
concludes on a very hilarious
note which is the next episode,

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.610
the next episode in which
they're going to the woods,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:32.733
where Marcela has escaped,
and they find a locus

00:51:32.733 --> 00:51:35.896
amoenus,
which is a common place in

00:51:35.896 --> 00:51:41.329
literary art and literature,
a very pleasant place that is

00:51:41.329 --> 00:51:44.577
with grass,
with shade, with water,

00:51:44.577 --> 00:51:47.880
a running brook making a
pleasant sound,

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.179
and so forth.
 

00:51:49.179 --> 00:51:50.849
And what do we have,
what happens here?

00:51:50.849 --> 00:51:57.164
We have here the translation
sort of this amorous episode

00:51:57.164 --> 00:52:01.085
into animal love,
when poor Rocinante,

00:52:01.085 --> 00:52:06.250
who doesn't seem to be strong
enough to harbor such desires,

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:13.650
meets some mares that are being
also put there to graze,

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:18.280
and have water by some men from
Yanguas--

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.530
these are Galicians.
 

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:23.402
We've met now people from
various regions in Spain--and

00:52:23.402 --> 00:52:24.480
what happens?
 

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:28.539
When poor Rocinante approaches
the mares,

00:52:28.539 --> 00:52:32.083
as the text says,
to communicate his desires to

00:52:32.083 --> 00:52:34.840
them,
they meet him with hoofs,

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.911
they kick him,
and then their keepers come and

00:52:38.911 --> 00:52:42.659
beat the daylights out of poor
Rocinante,

00:52:42.659 --> 00:52:46.739
and Don Quixote and Sancho try
to intervene,

00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:51.309
and they are also beaten up by
these people.

00:52:51.309 --> 00:52:56.065
This is the conclusion in a way
of the GrisÃ³stomo and

00:52:56.065 --> 00:52:59.369
Marcela episode,
but in a humorous key.

00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:04.101
Cervantes likes to work with
this contrast and with this

00:53:04.101 --> 00:53:09.519
transposition of something that
was very serious and even somber

00:53:09.519 --> 00:53:14.079
in the GrisÃ³stomo and
Marcela episode into this

00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:19.413
slapstick comedy episode of poor
Rocinante trying to seduce the

00:53:19.413 --> 00:53:22.940
mares and being kicked
viciously.

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:28.050
So I think that this is the end
of the Marcela and

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.969
GrisÃ³stomo episode.
 

00:53:30.969 --> 00:53:34.679
The last comment on it as it
were.

00:53:34.679 --> 00:53:40.907
Now, the knight and his squire
themselves are about to enter

00:53:40.907 --> 00:53:46.440
into the thick of the novel,
which will be a counterpoint

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.224
between the Sierra Morena--
that is, these hills into which

00:53:51.224 --> 00:53:54.077
they go--
fleeing from the Holy

00:53:54.077 --> 00:53:59.900
Brotherhood, and also because
Don Quixote wants to do penance

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:04.523
for Dulcinea,
a wilderness like the one in

00:54:04.523 --> 00:54:09.608
which Marcela was lost,
a counterpoint between that and

00:54:09.608 --> 00:54:12.960
Juan Palomeque's inn,
the inn where the fracas

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.184
happened before with Maritornes,
and so forth,

00:54:16.184 --> 00:54:19.679
which will become a temple,
a courthouse,

00:54:19.679 --> 00:54:24.429
and where the complicated love
stories in Part I,

00:54:24.429 --> 00:54:28.728
and you will see how many
complicated love stories ensue

00:54:28.728 --> 00:54:34.309
will be resolved in that inn,
and so that is what we are

00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:39.050
going to move into in the next
classes.

00:54:39.050 --> 00:54:44.000

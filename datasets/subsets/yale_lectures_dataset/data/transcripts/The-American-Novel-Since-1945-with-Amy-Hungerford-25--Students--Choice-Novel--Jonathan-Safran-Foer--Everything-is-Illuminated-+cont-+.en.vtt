00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.272
Professor Amy
Hungerford: The exercise of

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:06.470
inviting you to choose our last
novel,

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.030
as I think I explained in the
very first class of this term,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.213
is an exercise in thinking
together about what defines a

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:21.510
period of literature.
So, for all the other books in

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.162
the syllabus,
I came with my rationale for

00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:26.951
why I included them,
and for this book,

00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:30.423
I'm invited again to think
about whether I would,

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:35.760
if I were teaching this again,
and you had not chosen it.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.176
So, today I want to reflect on
that, and it will lead directly

00:00:40.176 --> 00:00:44.086
into my analysis of what the
Holocaust is doing in this

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:47.116
novel,
and then I will have some

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:51.360
parting words for you to
conclude the course.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.694
When I think about books to
include, I have four categories

00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:02.656
that I think about.
One is books that are somehow

00:01:02.656 --> 00:01:06.157
representative.
So, the books in this course

00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:09.355
that fit that bill,
you might think of the ones

00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:14.103
that feature the Identity Plot.
As I argued in that lecture at

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:17.600
mid semester,
the Identity Plot is a reigning

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.620
narrative structure in this
period,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.129
and some of the books in our
syllabus culminating in The

00:01:24.129 --> 00:01:26.670
Human Stain-- and I think
this book,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.384
too, could be included in that
group--all are representative of

00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:35.110
different versions of that
narrative structure.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.090
So: representative.
Innovative:

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.692
I include works on the syllabus
that I consider innovative in

00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:46.477
the form of the novel,
in the genre of the novel,

00:01:46.477 --> 00:01:50.042
or for their subject matter.
Somehow they think about

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.440
something in a way that I
haven't known anything else to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.125
think about before.
I think Lolita fits this

00:01:57.125 --> 00:02:00.200
model very well,
and in its own way The

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.727
Bluest Eye,
 at that time in the

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:08.566
1970s, took up a subject that
had also been neglected and was

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:11.470
innovative in its subject
matter.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:19.056
Is a book widely read?
Well, this book certainly meets

00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:23.102
that criterion,
and some of our other books do,

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:25.560
as well.
Lolita is one;

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.612
The Human Stain is
another, The Woman Warrior,

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:33.222
pretty much any Morrison
novel you can choose:

00:02:33.222 --> 00:02:36.979
there are lots of books that
fit this criteria.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:42.311
And usually what I'm aiming for
is a book that will be both

00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:47.735
widely read and something else
on my list, so that it covers

00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:51.089
more than one base.
And finally,

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:55.271
and this is the most evanescent
category, is it somehow

00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:58.680
excellent or important in some
other way?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.990
Generally, for me this is an
aesthetic category.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.469
So, is it an excellent example
of writing?

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.349
is it an excellent example of
narrative art?

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.676
is it important in what it
thinks about somehow

00:03:14.676 --> 00:03:19.308
philosophically,
topically, in a way that

00:03:19.308 --> 00:03:25.105
nothing else quite can match?
I talked to you on Monday a

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:29.713
little bit about Jonathan Safran
Foer's ambitions for this novel

00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:33.042
and his ambitions,
in general, as he expresses

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:38.320
them in interviews.
I think, when I consider this

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:46.629
novel, I know that this is where
Foer's interest truly lies.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.690
I'm sure he wants to be widely
read.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.898
I'm sure he wants to be
innovative, and that's probably

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:56.819
connected with the excellence or
importance that he's aiming at.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.060
He probably doesn't want to be
representative.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.524
Most writers want to be
singular rather than

00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:09.452
representative.
But this is where the

00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:14.806
investment really is,
and it's in that category that,

00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:19.439
I think, we find his use of the
Holocaust.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:24.060
It's in the effort to be
important, to be writing about

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.139
something important in this
novel,

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.634
that the Holocaust comes to
have such a place in it,

00:04:31.634 --> 00:04:37.449
or that he chooses a story that
has the Holocaust at its center.

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:43.470
Now, I myself am reserving
judgment on the excellence or

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.572
importance of this novel,
but I will say that it is

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:52.959
certainly representative of two
things.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:56.449
One is a version of the
Identity Plot.

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.317
It is a novel of a young
person, two young people,

00:05:00.317 --> 00:05:04.658
coming to seek out their past
and somehow gain from that

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:09.459
search some sense of themselves;
so, it is a version of the

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:14.163
Identity Plot.
It is also representative of

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:19.139
late modernist formal
characteristics;

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.129
so, this is clever in the way
that John Barth is clever with

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.926
language.
It is funny in the way that

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:30.730
Pynchon and Barth are,
just drawing from our syllabus.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.579
It makes some of the kinds of
moves that The Woman Warrior

00:05:34.579 --> 00:05:37.801
makes.
So, it is representative in

00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:42.008
that way.
I do not think it innovates

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.437
formally.
There's nothing I see here,

00:05:45.437 --> 00:05:49.769
formally, that I have not seen
elsewhere and before.

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:53.772
So, for me, it doesn't quite
meet that criteria,

00:05:53.772 --> 00:05:58.199
but "representative" and
"widely read," certainly.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:03.258
Now, there is a way in
which I think it could be

00:06:03.258 --> 00:06:08.217
understood as innovative,
and my sort of kernel for

00:06:08.217 --> 00:06:11.590
thinking about this is on 185.

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:24.014
This is in that harrowing scene
where the woman they think of as

00:06:24.014 --> 00:06:31.558
Augustine has told them the
story of the murder of the Jews

00:06:31.558 --> 00:06:35.945
of Trachimbrod,
and then afterwards the

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:40.527
grandfather confesses to his
complicit conduct with that

00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:41.360
murder.

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.708
And Alex, as he's translating
for Jonathan his grandfather's

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:53.019
words, he says in the middle of
185:

00:06:53.019 --> 00:06:57.256
You cannot know how it
felt to have to hear these

00:06:57.256 --> 00:07:02.442
things and then repeat them,
because when I repeated them I

00:07:02.442 --> 00:07:06.689
felt like I was making them new
again.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.748
That phrase,
"making them new again," is

00:07:10.748 --> 00:07:16.680
loaded for any ambitious writer
coming after modernism.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.220
"Make it new" was the dictum
that Ezra Pound held out as

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.018
defining literature that could
matter formally,

00:07:25.018 --> 00:07:27.660
aesthetically,
innovatively;

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:34.907
so, to make it new in writing
is very closely allied with the

00:07:34.907 --> 00:07:39.860
project of modernism,
a formal project.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:46.049
To use that phrase in this
emotionally loaded moment

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:51.580
suggests two things.
One is, it draws on a whole

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:56.931
history of discourse about
genocide, and particularly about

00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:01.098
the Holocaust,
that could be encompassed under

00:08:01.098 --> 00:08:05.385
the banner of trauma theory.
Now, some of you may have

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:09.027
encountered trauma theory.
It's a sort of mix of

00:08:09.027 --> 00:08:13.627
psychoanalysis and literary
criticism that has been powerful

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:18.285
in the past couple of decades.
Its power is waning,

00:08:18.285 --> 00:08:24.125
I think, although there is a
new interest in Sociology in

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:28.882
trauma, now.
In the former literary critical

00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:33.518
version of it,
trauma theorists argued that to

00:08:33.518 --> 00:08:38.837
tell the story again,
to tell the story of a trauma

00:08:38.837 --> 00:08:45.092
again, was to re-experience it.
This was a way of understanding

00:08:45.092 --> 00:08:50.614
representation as human
experience, as actual experience

00:08:50.614 --> 00:08:53.871
unmediated,
and the special thing about

00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:58.192
trauma was that it was the only
kind of experience--this is what

00:08:58.192 --> 00:09:01.690
most trauma theorists
argued--that it was really the

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.600
only kind of experience that had
this quality to it,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:11.532
this peculiar quality to it,
that it remained real in the

00:09:11.532 --> 00:09:17.358
sense of remaining experience
and not becoming language,

00:09:17.358 --> 00:09:21.497
somehow.
This was a way of imagining

00:09:21.497 --> 00:09:24.735
language, also,
conversely, as being

00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:27.999
experience.
And, for some trauma theorists,

00:09:27.999 --> 00:09:31.367
this analysis of language
spread out to other kinds of

00:09:31.367 --> 00:09:34.836
language,
so that any language could be

00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:39.970
understood as in some sense
traumatic, and this is a far

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.554
reach of it.
Much of this work,

00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:44.990
I have to say,
was done at Yale by two

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.149
scholars, Cathy Carruth and
Shoshana Feldman.

00:09:48.149 --> 00:09:52.435
Both have now left the
institution, but Yale was very

00:09:52.435 --> 00:09:57.127
well known for trauma theory.
It had its applications in

00:09:57.127 --> 00:10:00.992
Holocaust Studies,
in particular in the building

00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:06.090
of the Fortunoff Archive of
testimony which is housed here,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.600
I think in Sterling.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:16.450
The effort to make videotapes
of survivors' testimonies was,

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.540
in part, of course,
a historical effort to get that

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:27.559
knowledge secure before that
generation passed away,

00:10:27.559 --> 00:10:32.598
to gather as much as could be
known of the human experience of

00:10:32.598 --> 00:10:36.017
the Holocaust.
But there was a reason,

00:10:36.017 --> 00:10:38.570
I think, that it was video.

00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:46.811
There was a great desire among
people who wrote and thought

00:10:46.811 --> 00:10:51.582
about and studied the Holocaust
to have that immediacy that

00:10:51.582 --> 00:10:55.800
video was thought to give;
so, rather than have

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.913
transcribed testimonies,
or written testimonies,

00:10:59.913 --> 00:11:04.989
you get to see the actual face
and expression of the person

00:11:04.989 --> 00:11:08.677
telling that story.
This is something that

00:11:08.677 --> 00:11:11.913
scholars have--since the
founding of the archive--have

00:11:11.913 --> 00:11:15.149
spent a lot of time thinking
about and theorizing.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:19.334
In the course of that
theorizing, the word "witness"

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:23.929
has come to have a very specific
and powerful meaning.

00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:29.500
The interviewer was to think of
herself or himself as--not a

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:35.448
questioner or as an interviewer
in the way that we would usually

00:11:35.448 --> 00:11:41.207
understand that role--but rather
as a witness to that person's

00:11:41.207 --> 00:11:44.419
story,
a witness in the sense of a

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:48.115
judicial witness,
someone who would be in a court

00:11:48.115 --> 00:11:52.090
to affirm that something had,
indeed, happened.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.460
There was a sense that
validation was needed,

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.830
in the context of gathering
this evidence.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.866
Witnessing was theorized in a
much more complex way by

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:09.568
Shoshana Felman and Dori Laub,
a psychiatrist who is--I think

00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:14.909
Dori Laub is still in New Haven.
I think he's still at Yale.

00:12:14.909 --> 00:12:19.896
But, together they wrote a book
called Testimony that

00:12:19.896 --> 00:12:24.487
had a lot to say about exactly
how the witness functions in

00:12:24.487 --> 00:12:28.049
relation to the person who is
testifying.

00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:32.771
And I think you can see the
mark of all of this thought

00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:37.143
about how the Holocaust is
received in the present,

00:12:37.143 --> 00:12:40.515
stamping Foer's work.
So, you see it,

00:12:40.515 --> 00:12:44.547
in part, in that little
sentence that I just read to

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:48.580
you, and saying it again it was
"making it new."

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.452
It's as if it's a moment in
which trauma is transmitted

00:12:52.452 --> 00:12:55.176
through language,
and is imagined to be

00:12:55.176 --> 00:12:57.830
transmitted in an unmediated
way;

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:04.526
so, the repetition that we
experience as readers,

00:13:04.526 --> 00:13:06.909
all of these horrible things
are said twice,

00:13:06.909 --> 00:13:13.585
because we see Alex translating
them, and that's dramatized for

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:18.000
us by the device of Alex as
translator.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.213
So, its debt to modernism,
or the way it has its eye on

00:13:22.213 --> 00:13:25.586
modernism behind it,
is closely allied to this

00:13:25.586 --> 00:13:29.429
understanding of language and
its relationship to trauma.

00:13:29.429 --> 00:13:33.782
Now, by the time Jonathan
Safran Foer is writing this

00:13:33.782 --> 00:13:38.289
book, not only has Holocaust
Studies established this whole

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:42.487
body of thought about language,
but there are also many

00:13:42.487 --> 00:13:46.470
examples of what you might call
the American Holocaust Novel,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.434
and the one I'm going to use in
my lecture today,

00:13:49.434 --> 00:13:51.720
to think about in relation to
this,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.220
is Art Spiegelman's graphic
novel Maus.

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.940
How many of you have read
it?

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.248
Okay. Good, a bunch of you.
For those of you who haven't,

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:04.347
it's the story of a character
named Art Spiegleman,

00:14:04.347 --> 00:14:08.940
and you'll recognize that
device of course from Foer.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:13.402
Art Spiegleman is a cartoonist
writing a book about his

00:14:13.402 --> 00:14:18.113
father's experiences in the
Holocaust and in concentration

00:14:18.113 --> 00:14:21.526
camps.
He goes through the novel

00:14:21.526 --> 00:14:27.629
alternating between scenes of
Art interviewing his father,

00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:30.900
Vladek, and then it sinks in to
Vladek's story,

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:35.237
and there are lots of extended
scenes where we just see Vladek

00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:39.929
escaping from camps and making
his way through them and so on,

00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:45.566
doing all the things that he
did to finally escape with his

00:14:45.566 --> 00:14:49.402
wife, Anja.
We find out fairly early in the

00:14:49.402 --> 00:14:53.137
first volume of
Maus--it's a two-volume

00:14:53.137 --> 00:14:58.200
graphic novel--that Art's mother
killed herself well after she

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:01.519
arrived in America as an
immigrant,

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:05.113
having escaped,
and we see her in an inserted

00:15:05.113 --> 00:15:08.870
cartoon in a different style in
the bathtub.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.830
She slit her wrists in the
bathtub.

00:15:15.019 --> 00:15:19.571
What's striking about that
graphic novel--It's extremely

00:15:19.571 --> 00:15:24.200
smart in its meditation on the
relationship between a son and

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.829
his father and the relationship
between growing up in America

00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:33.535
and surviving the Holocaust--but
what's really striking is its

00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:38.009
meditation on the problem of
Art's insignificance.

00:15:38.009 --> 00:15:43.643
How can his childhood and his
child's problems--being bullied

00:15:43.643 --> 00:15:49.089
at school or whatever it is--how
can those compete with his

00:15:49.089 --> 00:15:54.534
father's experience of having
survived the Holocaust by his

00:15:54.534 --> 00:15:58.923
own wits and by luck?
That dramatic story is

00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:03.641
impossible for the son to match,
and so there are certain

00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:07.854
ways--I have argued in
print--certain ways that Art

00:16:07.854 --> 00:16:12.572
appropriates his father's story
and imagines himself as a

00:16:12.572 --> 00:16:13.920
survivor.

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:20.172
So, it's a way of transmitting
the trauma of the Holocaust from

00:16:20.172 --> 00:16:24.599
one generation to another.
And there are lots of graphic

00:16:24.599 --> 00:16:30.702
devices and linguistic tricks
that Spiegelman uses to effect

00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:33.038
this,
and I won't go into that

00:16:33.038 --> 00:16:36.810
detail, now, but it's something
that I've argued at length.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.860
What makes Everything is
Illuminated different and,

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.000
I would argue,
innovative is that it,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.899
for me, represents the
third-generation effort to

00:16:52.899 --> 00:16:54.850
recover the Holocaust.

00:16:58.029 --> 00:17:02.819
So, by the time Foer is
writing, these stories have been

00:17:02.819 --> 00:17:07.956
told, not only by Spiegelman
(His books came out in 1987 and

00:17:07.956 --> 00:17:10.033
1991,
or '86 and '91,

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:14.950
the two volumes of Maus,
so, well before Foer wrote

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.240
this,
when Foer is just a child).

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:24.450
That was not the only book on
the experience of the Holocaust.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.992
Those would include Cynthia
Ozick's The Shawl,

00:17:27.992 --> 00:17:31.756
a very famous example,
a little later a European

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:35.004
writer, a German writer living
in England, W.

00:17:35.004 --> 00:17:37.144
G.
Sebald wrote Austerlitz,

00:17:37.144 --> 00:17:40.761
had a very similar
structure of a child of the

00:17:40.761 --> 00:17:44.842
Kindertransport,
someone who had been taken from

00:17:44.842 --> 00:17:48.750
Prague to England along with all
of the other children,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.901
Jewish children of his
neighborhood,

00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:57.371
to save them.
He discovers this as his own

00:17:57.371 --> 00:18:02.657
past, and he tries to go back
and find the traces of his

00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:06.309
parents in the concentration
camps.

00:18:06.309 --> 00:18:10.386
And finally he finds a snippet
of film from one of the

00:18:10.386 --> 00:18:14.769
concentration camps where his
mother was--his mother was a

00:18:14.769 --> 00:18:19.307
singer--and he slows it down
further and further and further

00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:25.825
just to try to glimpse her face.
This is a story of the hunt for

00:18:25.825 --> 00:18:32.900
the beloved parent and for the
ground of a child's identity.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:38.076
This story has been told many
times by the time Foer is

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:41.328
writing this novel.
In addition,

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:47.417
most of these prior versions in
fiction, and some in memoir,

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:51.958
have to do with the
first-generation American

00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:55.743
experience.
So, Foer finds himself

00:18:55.743 --> 00:18:59.764
belated in two ways:
one, because the story of the

00:18:59.764 --> 00:19:04.359
Holocaust and of finding out
that secret has already been

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:06.770
told;
and two, because he's not

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.126
second generation.
He's not the child of a

00:19:10.126 --> 00:19:14.140
survivor but the grandchild of a
survivor.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:18.789
So, what do you do to make that
story your own?

00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:23.880
If you are committed to its
centrality to who you are,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.740
how do you make that into an
unmediated kind of experience?

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.385
One way that that's done,
both in second-generation

00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:37.250
stories and I think in this
third-generation story,

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:44.706
is by playing off of and
excavating the Jewish cultural

00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:50.441
veneration for memory.
So in Jewish tradition memory

00:19:50.441 --> 00:19:53.697
of parents, of the dead,
of past events,

00:19:53.697 --> 00:19:57.119
is at the heart of religious
practice,

00:19:57.119 --> 00:20:01.579
but also of secular versions of
religious practice.

00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:05.560
This novel is full of those
secular versions of religious

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.682
practice, and it explicitly
talks about children's relation

00:20:09.682 --> 00:20:13.680
to the memory of their parents.
This is on 268.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.380
Oops.
I got my page wrong there.

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.040
Sorry, 260.

00:20:31.019 --> 00:20:36.293
He's describing here the itch
to remember that the novel

00:20:36.293 --> 00:20:41.867
imagines as particularly Jewish:
But children had it worst

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:44.440
of all.
For although it would seem that

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:48.571
they had fewer memories to haunt
them, they still had the itch of

00:20:48.571 --> 00:20:51.670
memory as strong as the elders
of the shtetl.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:55.565
Their strings were not even
their own, but tied around them

00:20:55.565 --> 00:20:58.974
by parents and grandparents,
strings not fastened to

00:20:58.974 --> 00:21:02.310
anything, but hanging loosely
from the darkness.

00:21:06.009 --> 00:21:10.712
So, you can imagine this story
of Jonathan going back to find

00:21:10.712 --> 00:21:15.023
the woman who helped his
grandfather escape as an effort

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:18.549
to tie that string to something
concrete.

00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:24.751
The fact that he never can
really find that woman suggests

00:21:24.751 --> 00:21:31.598
that, already internalized here,
is something that Holocaust

00:21:31.598 --> 00:21:38.710
literature coming before this
has been intent on examining and

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:42.349
questioning,
which is: can you ever have

00:21:42.349 --> 00:21:45.009
that unmediated relation to the
past;

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:52.403
can you ever tie memory back to
the event in a way that feels

00:21:52.403 --> 00:21:58.404
like it's a real connection?
So, here there is a fairly

00:21:58.404 --> 00:22:02.924
easy, if also wistful or
elegiac, admission that you

00:22:02.924 --> 00:22:06.470
can't ever really tie that
string up.

00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:11.663
This is why the hunt is never
going to be successful in the

00:22:11.663 --> 00:22:14.688
novel;
we will never tie up all those

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:18.534
little details.
It's meant to be that way,

00:22:18.534 --> 00:22:24.367
because at this late date it's
clear that's the only way it

00:22:24.367 --> 00:22:28.289
could be, and that's not
innovative.

00:22:28.289 --> 00:22:35.250
It's simply where the genre is
right now.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:46.001
However, this novel is loath to
part with the drama that earlier

00:22:46.001 --> 00:22:53.339
stories made from the recovery
narrative.

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:57.428
So, for Jonathan,
the mystery is not what

00:22:57.428 --> 00:23:02.260
happened to his grandparents
during the Holocaust.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.885
That's the classic question.
The parents won't talk about

00:23:05.885 --> 00:23:08.660
what happened.
The child wants to know.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.877
The child knows there's
something back there,

00:23:11.877 --> 00:23:15.680
and the hunt is to find out
exactly what happened,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:23.445
and usually it's hidden either
because the parent left a prior

00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:28.932
child, lost a prior child,
or somehow felt guilty about

00:23:28.932 --> 00:23:32.845
surviving, either because of
explicit acts where they were

00:23:32.845 --> 00:23:37.032
forced to sacrifice someone in
their family in order to escape

00:23:37.032 --> 00:23:41.220
or in order to help someone else
in their family escape;

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:44.032
they were forced to choose.
And we see that choice

00:23:44.032 --> 00:23:47.890
thematized in the Holocaust
sections of this novel.

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:51.660
So, there is that hiddenness of
the Holocaust experience.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:56.230
That's not what's hidden in
this novel.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.539
That history is not what
Jonathan doesn't know.

00:24:02.539 --> 00:24:05.680
He knows his grandmother
survived the Holocaust.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.600
That's not a mystery.
The mystery is: who helped her?

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.289
Who helped his grandfather?
Sorry. It's the grandfather.

00:24:14.289 --> 00:24:18.480
Who helped his grandfather to
escape?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.880
That's the mystery.
Augustine is the mystery woman.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:29.220
The photograph represents that
missing or hidden knowledge.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:34.148
That this drops out of the
picture of the novel relatively

00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:37.519
painlessly--he'll never find
her--is,

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:42.071
I think, the mark of how the
story of hiding something that's

00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:46.659
hidden gets displaced onto Alex.
So, what I see here is the

00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:50.678
transfer of the story of the
hidden past from the hidden past

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:54.564
of the victim's side of the
Holocaust to the hidden past of

00:24:54.564 --> 00:24:58.640
the perpetrator's side.
This is a displacement of that

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.060
narrative onto the perpetrators;

00:25:05.069 --> 00:25:08.688
so, now it's Alex who is
looking to find the secret

00:25:08.688 --> 00:25:12.089
buried in the dysfunctionality
of his family.

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:17.420
Now it's Alex who finds,
in speaking to his grandfather,

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.750
some explanation for why his
father is such a tyrant.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:27.053
And the same logic of memory
and genealogy that you see in

00:25:27.053 --> 00:25:31.356
the way Jewish families are
talked about in their relation

00:25:31.356 --> 00:25:34.829
to memory and history between
generations,

00:25:34.829 --> 00:25:38.970
that is reproduced as the
father says, "You are

00:25:38.970 --> 00:25:44.279
responsible for your son," the
father is responsible for the

00:25:44.279 --> 00:25:47.919
son,
somehow the father is reflected

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:51.429
in the son.
So, the choice that Alex's

00:25:51.429 --> 00:25:56.279
grandfather made--to point out
his friend, Herschel,

00:25:56.279 --> 00:26:04.220
as a Jew and to thus give him
up to the murderous Nazis--this

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:11.895
is somehow played out in the
dysfunctionality of the family

00:26:11.895 --> 00:26:15.991
in the present,
in the terrible rages and

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:17.700
drunkenness of the father.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.453
It's interesting to me that
this novel is about making the

00:26:26.453 --> 00:26:30.989
relationship between
grandchildren and grandparents

00:26:30.989 --> 00:26:36.646
as immediate as possible,
and so I think it's really

00:26:36.646 --> 00:26:42.700
interesting that we have Alex
disowning his father.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:46.958
"You are not my father," he
says at the end of the novel as

00:26:46.958 --> 00:26:50.849
he throws his father out of the
house, essentially.

00:26:50.849 --> 00:26:56.097
It's a way of getting the
second generation out of the way

00:26:56.097 --> 00:27:00.281
and hopping into that space,
so you can see it in the

00:27:00.281 --> 00:27:02.650
second- and third-generation
structure.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:08.143
You swipe the parents out of
the way, and you hop into their

00:27:08.143 --> 00:27:13.917
place, as immediately descended
from the people who experienced

00:27:13.917 --> 00:27:18.664
these events.
A problem for Americans

00:27:18.664 --> 00:27:25.461
writing about the Holocaust is
that, even if you immigrated

00:27:25.461 --> 00:27:30.362
here as a survivor,
this is not the land of those

00:27:30.362 --> 00:27:34.927
events, and so I think this
gives us some insight into the

00:27:34.927 --> 00:27:40.168
use of the European setting.
Europe is where the important

00:27:40.168 --> 00:27:44.162
history happened.
That's why a novel trying to be

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:47.550
important in these terms has to
be set there.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:56.012
So, if you set out looking for
an important subject matter,

00:27:56.012 --> 00:27:59.438
you need that historical
grounding, and it's not in

00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:00.860
America;
it's in Europe.

00:28:04.849 --> 00:28:10.991
On 117, you can see very
clearly how the story of

00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:17.900
Augustine and Alex picks up the
trope of witnessing,

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.164
and it's of course accomplished
through Alex's butchered

00:28:22.164 --> 00:28:24.714
English.
This is on 117,

00:28:24.714 --> 00:28:31.930
where he holds the photograph
out to Augustine and he says:

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:36.829
"Have you ever witnessed
anyone in this photograph?"

00:28:36.829 --> 00:28:38.380
She examined it for several
moments.

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.374
"No."
I do not know why but I

00:28:41.374 --> 00:28:44.817
inquired again.
"Have you ever witnessed anyone

00:28:44.817 --> 00:28:47.826
in this photograph?"
"No," she said again,

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:51.607
though the second no did not
seem like a parrot but a

00:28:51.607 --> 00:28:55.543
different variety of no.
"Have you ever witnessed anyone

00:28:55.543 --> 00:28:59.029
in this photograph?"
I inquired, and this time I

00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:03.804
held it very proximal to her
face like Grandfather held it to

00:29:03.804 --> 00:29:06.223
his face.
"No," she said again,

00:29:06.223 --> 00:29:09.289
and this seemed like a third
variety of no.

00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:11.319
I put the photograph in her
hands.

00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:14.019
"Have you ever witnessed anyone
in the photograph?"

00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:16.923
"No," she said,
but in her no I was certain

00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:19.550
that I could hear "Please
persevere;

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.710
inquire me again."
So I did.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.890
"Have you ever witnessed anyone
in the photograph?"

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:28.482
She moved her thumbs over the
faces as if she were attempting

00:29:28.482 --> 00:29:30.640
to erase them.
"No."

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.059
"Have you ever witnessed anyone
in the photograph?"

00:29:34.059 --> 00:29:37.302
"No," she said,
and she put the photograph on

00:29:37.302 --> 00:29:39.869
her lap.
"Have you ever witnessed anyone

00:29:39.869 --> 00:29:42.019
in the photograph?"
I inquired.

00:29:42.019 --> 00:29:44.913
"No," she said,
still examining it but only

00:29:44.913 --> 00:29:48.712
from the angles of her eyes.
"Have you ever witnessed anyone

00:29:48.712 --> 00:29:50.990
in the photograph?"
"No."

00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:54.660
She was humming again with more
volume.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.090
"Have you ever witnessed anyone
in the photograph?"

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:02.326
"No," she said, "no."
I saw a tear descend to her

00:30:02.326 --> 00:30:06.008
white dress.
It too would dry and leave a

00:30:06.008 --> 00:30:08.008
mark.
"Have you ever witnessed anyone

00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:10.697
in the photograph?"
I inquired, and I felt cruel,

00:30:10.697 --> 00:30:14.072
I felt like an awful person,
but I was certain that I was

00:30:14.072 --> 00:30:18.080
performing the right thing.
"No," she said, "I have not.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.980
They all look like strangers."
I periled everything.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:26.800
"Has anyone in this photograph
ever witnessed you?"

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.637
Another tear descended.
"I have been waiting for you

00:30:31.637 --> 00:30:35.492
for so long." 
Here that effort,

00:30:35.492 --> 00:30:39.592
through witness,
to come to an unmediated

00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:44.922
connection with the past and
with the violence of the

00:30:44.922 --> 00:30:50.724
Holocaust, it's acted out.
It is, as Alex said,

00:30:50.724 --> 00:30:57.547
performed by that almost
liturgical repetition of the

00:30:57.547 --> 00:31:03.460
question and the answer,
and the way that Augustine's

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.440
body gets closer and closer to
the photograph;

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.903
she touches the faces;
she finally merges herself and

00:31:12.903 --> 00:31:18.269
the photograph by letting her
tears fall on it.

00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:23.341
So, the question is:
have you ever witnessed for

00:31:23.341 --> 00:31:25.712
these people?
She has not,

00:31:25.712 --> 00:31:28.724
yet, because no one has come to
hear her witness,

00:31:28.724 --> 00:31:32.896
and I'm reminded,
then, of the structure of those

00:31:32.896 --> 00:31:38.541
survivor testimonies on video,
where a witness is required in

00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:42.907
order for the story to be told.
And so, Augustine,

00:31:42.907 --> 00:31:46.346
now, she has not witnessed,
because she did not have a

00:31:46.346 --> 00:31:50.022
witness.
Now she has her witnesses,

00:31:50.022 --> 00:31:56.655
and she will witness to them.
And so Alex comes to be

00:31:56.655 --> 00:32:03.920
undone by what he finds about
himself, what he finds out about

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:11.287
his grandfather and his family.
In the second-generation story,

00:32:11.287 --> 00:32:16.529
often it is the family of the
second generation,

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:21.284
the child of the survivor,
who is undone by what they find

00:32:21.284 --> 00:32:24.435
out about their parent.
So here, again,

00:32:24.435 --> 00:32:28.057
the structure of the narrative
is transferred to the

00:32:28.057 --> 00:32:32.881
perpetrator's side.
And who is lying in the bath

00:32:32.881 --> 00:32:39.335
with their wrists cut?
Not the survivor but the

00:32:39.335 --> 00:32:43.556
perpetrator.
So, you get that image from

00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:47.990
Maus transferred into the
perpetrator's family.

00:32:51.009 --> 00:32:59.343
What I find quite remarkable
about the formal techniques of

00:32:59.343 --> 00:33:08.108
this novel is how they finally
reflect on that transfer of the

00:33:08.108 --> 00:33:16.585
narrative from the Holocaust
literature to the perpetrator's

00:33:16.585 --> 00:33:20.509
story,
and if you look on 160 we can

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:22.710
begin to see how this works.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:33.411
If you'll recall,
they are sitting in the silence

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:41.019
and darkness together peeling
corn for Augustine,

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:48.920
and Alex takes Jonathan's diary
and opens it and he says on 159:

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.542
This is what I read.
He told his father that he

00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:55.589
could care for Mother and little
Igor.

00:33:55.589 --> 00:33:58.520
It took his saying it to make
it true.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.109
Finally he was ready.
His father could not believe

00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:04.150
this thing.
"What?" he asked.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.433
"What?"
And Sasha told him again that

00:34:06.433 --> 00:34:09.308
he would take care of the
family, that he would understand

00:34:09.308 --> 00:34:11.679
if his father had to leave and
never return,

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.869
and that it would not even make
him less of a father.

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:17.639
He told his father that he
would forgive.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:20.657
Oh, his father became so angry,
so full of wrath,

00:34:20.657 --> 00:34:23.360
and he told Sasha that he would
kill him,

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.806
and Sasha told his father that
he would kill him,

00:34:25.806 --> 00:34:28.661
and they moved at each other
with violence and his father

00:34:28.661 --> 00:34:30.336
said,
"Say it to my face,

00:34:30.336 --> 00:34:33.475
not to the floor," and Sasha
said, "You are not my

00:34:33.475 --> 00:34:40.343
father."
So, in this scene Alex begins

00:34:40.343 --> 00:34:51.199
to understand that Jonathan is
using him as a character,

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:55.921
and moreover that Jonathan has
penetrated right into the most

00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:59.619
intimate and painful part of his
family life,

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:05.135
his relationship with his
father, and is fictionalizing

00:35:05.135 --> 00:35:08.128
that.
And of course if you turn to

00:35:08.128 --> 00:35:11.710
the end, I hope you recognize
this, on 274.

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:17.371
This is, in fact,
this passage from his diary,

00:35:17.371 --> 00:35:24.165
what we are given as the letter
from the grandfather to

00:35:24.165 --> 00:35:29.190
Jonathan, and there it is.
This is what happened.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:33.171
He told his father that
he could care for Mother and

00:35:33.171 --> 00:35:35.943
little Igor.
It took his saying it to make

00:35:35.943 --> 00:35:37.929
it true.
Finally he was ready.

00:35:37.929 --> 00:35:38.470
His father could not believe
this thing.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:40.856
"What?"
And so it goes,

00:35:40.856 --> 00:35:43.413
on to the end of that
paragraph, and you can see

00:35:43.413 --> 00:35:45.219
culminating,
as in the diary,

00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:48.435
with "Say it to my face,
not to the floor," and Sasha

00:35:48.435 --> 00:35:51.970
said,
"You are not my father."

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:57.151
What are we to make of this?
So, this is a bit of postmodern

00:35:57.151 --> 00:36:02.378
cleverness, if you will,
raising questions as have been

00:36:02.378 --> 00:36:08.187
raised in The Human Stain
about who exactly is writing

00:36:08.187 --> 00:36:12.929
this account,
whether it's Coleman or Nathan

00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:17.030
in that novel,
how it is that Nathan knows

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.679
what Coleman thinks,
how he knows all that happened,

00:36:21.679 --> 00:36:26.150
all that he says he knows that
happened in Coleman's life.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.135
Well, here at the very end
of the novel,

00:36:30.135 --> 00:36:35.232
when Foer brings out this
passage that has been provided

00:36:35.232 --> 00:36:38.940
much earlier in Jonathan's
notebook,

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:44.294
we are led to question the
authorship of all the letters in

00:36:44.294 --> 00:36:46.957
the book.
Now of course we know it's a

00:36:46.957 --> 00:36:50.309
novel, we know it's all written
by Jonathan Safran Foer,

00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:55.395
but in the logic of the novel
its self-awareness now verges

00:36:55.395 --> 00:36:59.926
towards this question.
It's not just the reader who's

00:36:59.926 --> 00:37:04.213
meant to question this,
but the novel asks us directly

00:37:04.213 --> 00:37:08.347
to question it.
So, what does it mean that

00:37:08.347 --> 00:37:13.909
Jonathan is revealed to be the
author of this letter?

00:37:13.909 --> 00:37:16.750
Well, there are a couple ways
of looking at it.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:23.266
There are those passages in the
Book of Antecedents--remember

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:29.674
the Jewish book of memory that
the Trachimbroders write over

00:37:29.674 --> 00:37:34.670
time--some of those entries are
prophetic.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:39.146
They tell the future,
and we're given an excerpt from

00:37:39.146 --> 00:37:42.590
that book that describes the
disaster,

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:50.545
and so we know that something
like prescience is a quality of

00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:55.635
Jewish writing,
imagined in this way as a kind

00:37:55.635 --> 00:38:00.659
of religious practice.
So, either we can understand

00:38:00.659 --> 00:38:06.561
Jonathan as carrying on that
tradition, that what he writes

00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:10.530
in his diary is similarly
proleptic,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:16.399
it looks towards the future and
transcribes the future,

00:38:16.399 --> 00:38:22.159
or we can see it as
constructing the future itself.

00:38:22.159 --> 00:38:27.518
So, we can see it either as
imagining what will inevitably

00:38:27.518 --> 00:38:32.500
happen, or as making the future
out of those words.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:39.826
I think we're meant to feel
both resonances to this formal

00:38:39.826 --> 00:38:46.609
trick, or this formal device,
but the resonance of control,

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:51.674
of making it happen,
leads us to I think quite an

00:38:51.674 --> 00:38:57.431
interesting place,
and leads me to wonder whether

00:38:57.431 --> 00:39:04.347
this is not a novel of revenge.
To transpose the story of a

00:39:04.347 --> 00:39:11.670
survivor of the Holocaust who
later, much later in their life,

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:17.066
finally comes to terms with
that terror and commits suicide,

00:39:17.066 --> 00:39:20.360
to transpose that well-worn
story,

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:26.501
well-known story,
into the perpetrator's life and

00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:34.434
family is a way of giving back
to the complicit the pain of the

00:39:34.434 --> 00:39:38.535
victims.
So, I think this is quite

00:39:38.535 --> 00:39:43.667
interesting.
Even though there are so many

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:49.690
moments where that sense of
fault is mitigated:

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:55.666
"would you not do the same?"
That question gets asked:

00:39:55.666 --> 00:40:00.059
Who would do differently?
How would you decide what to do?

00:40:00.059 --> 00:40:05.137
We're given examples of Lista's
father, who won't spit on the

00:40:05.137 --> 00:40:10.299
Torah even though he is not a
religious man and watches as his

00:40:10.299 --> 00:40:15.631
entire family is killed and then
finally spits so that he can be

00:40:15.631 --> 00:40:19.368
killed too.
We're given all kinds of

00:40:19.368 --> 00:40:23.199
morally ambiguous,
impossible situations,

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:28.850
situations really where moral
machinery isn't appropriate or

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:35.444
possible to think through.
But still, there is that sense

00:40:35.444 --> 00:40:42.450
that a controlling author has
scripted this future for this

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:46.800
particular family in the
present.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.880
So, that makes it quite
interesting to me,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.767
and I just want to look on 262
at another way that transposing

00:40:58.767 --> 00:41:05.655
the story outside of the Jewish
community radiates out in this

00:41:05.655 --> 00:41:08.996
novel,
and maybe mitigates that

00:41:08.996 --> 00:41:13.298
suggestion of a revenge plot,
and this is on 262 when

00:41:13.298 --> 00:41:16.940
suddenly the first-person plural
appears.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.910
I don't know if you noticed it
when you were reading.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.246
I found it quite striking.
This is talking about the

00:41:23.246 --> 00:41:29.460
people of the shtetl in their
last months of life.

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:35.637
"They waited to die.
And we cannot blame them,

00:41:35.637 --> 00:41:41.940
because we would do the same,
and we do do the same."

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:45.538
They ask that question
implicitly, "Would you do

00:41:45.538 --> 00:41:48.408
anything differently?
Would you go about your normal

00:41:48.408 --> 00:41:50.599
life?
What would you do?"

00:41:50.599 --> 00:41:54.863
And he says,
"We would do the same," but he

00:41:54.863 --> 00:41:59.940
also says, "We do do the same,"
as if mortality,

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:04.159
the fact of mortality,
the fact that we all are,

00:42:04.159 --> 00:42:09.366
all of us, waiting to die--and
in the meantime not thinking

00:42:09.366 --> 00:42:14.715
about that inevitable end,
going about our daily life with

00:42:14.715 --> 00:42:19.255
joy and play and all the range
of human experience and

00:42:19.255 --> 00:42:24.309
emotion--he says that that is
analogous to what these people

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:28.385
were doing,
even though their end looked so

00:42:28.385 --> 00:42:32.750
different from the one that
Jonathan Safran Foer,

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.440
the character in this novel,
expects to have for himself.

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.912
So, the Holocaust story and
the reflection that it causes

00:42:41.912 --> 00:42:46.384
back on the activities of life
radiates out in a universalist

00:42:46.384 --> 00:42:49.720
sense.
It doesn't just impose its

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:55.400
narrative on a new set of
participants in the Holocaust,

00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.381
that of the perpetrators or
those who are complicit,

00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:03.519
but it radiates out to all
people past and present.

00:43:03.519 --> 00:43:06.469
So, it becomes a quality of the
human condition.

00:43:06.469 --> 00:43:09.150
This is a softening move I
think.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:14.067
It suggests the tragedy
involved in all sides of this

00:43:14.067 --> 00:43:20.026
story, the tragedy of the simple
man trying to save his wife and

00:43:20.026 --> 00:43:25.700
child and in doing so becoming
complicit to the murder of his

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:26.930
friend.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.433
So we see that moral
complexity, and it feels like

00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:36.420
tragedy because of these
softening moves.

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.123
Now, I want to stop there and
say that it's in this

00:43:41.123 --> 00:43:46.391
innovation, this change to an
established narrative about

00:43:46.391 --> 00:43:51.659
genocide and its relation to
literature and writing,

00:43:51.659 --> 00:43:54.666
that I find this to be an
innovative novel,

00:43:54.666 --> 00:43:57.099
and if I were teaching a
course,

00:43:57.099 --> 00:44:00.178
which I used to teach
regularly, on genocide in

00:44:00.178 --> 00:44:04.060
literature, I would probably be
very happy to end with this

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.465
novel.
For that line of

00:44:06.465 --> 00:44:10.315
analysis of this period,
it's very appropriate as an

00:44:10.315 --> 00:44:13.481
innovative ending.
I think, though,

00:44:13.481 --> 00:44:17.830
in this novel,
it is partly there as a way of

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:23.039
taking on something really hard.
So, I talked a little bit

00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:26.719
on Monday about the quality of
this novel as a campus novel,

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:31.750
as the product of a young
person, and I was joking with

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:36.594
you a little bit about the bar
being set high for the

00:44:36.594 --> 00:44:42.090
achievements one can pull off by
the age of twenty-two.

00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:47.524
I want to use that fact about
Foer--that this is a first

00:44:47.524 --> 00:44:53.156
novel, that it's especially an
overtly ambitious novel--to

00:44:53.156 --> 00:44:57.800
reflect on something that's
closer to life,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:03.155
and this is I think something
that I've earned because

00:45:03.155 --> 00:45:07.400
literature is about its address
to life.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.951
After all, that's why we read
it, because it strikes us as a

00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:13.659
comment on things that are
important to us.

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:17.719
If we read that's one reason
why we read.

00:45:17.719 --> 00:45:22.327
So I want to use that question
of ambition, also,

00:45:22.327 --> 00:45:27.992
to address something that comes
up in the advising that I do

00:45:27.992 --> 00:45:32.119
here for students year in and
year out,

00:45:32.119 --> 00:45:36.716
and to get at that question I
want to read you something,

00:45:36.716 --> 00:45:41.340
as a good postmodernist,
from the nineteenth century.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.510
This is from Walden,
Henry David Thoreau's

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:49.172
Walden.
So we have read a lot of books

00:45:49.172 --> 00:45:51.909
together.
This little part I'm going to

00:45:51.909 --> 00:45:55.528
read to you from Walden
comes after Thoreau has

00:45:55.528 --> 00:45:59.420
talked about the pleasures and
the virtues of reading,

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.039
and then this is in a section
called "Sounds."

00:46:04.039 --> 00:46:06.680
The last section was called
"Reading."

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:11.989
This section is called "Sounds."
I did not read books the

00:46:11.989 --> 00:46:15.969
first summer.
I hoed beans.

00:46:15.969 --> 00:46:19.239
Nay, I often did better than
this.

00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:23.063
There were times when I could
not afford to sacrifice the

00:46:23.063 --> 00:46:27.297
bloom of the present moment to
any work, whether of the head or

00:46:27.297 --> 00:46:30.131
hands.
I love a broad margin to my

00:46:30.131 --> 00:46:32.711
life.
Sometimes in a summer morning,

00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:36.704
having taken my accustomed
bath, I sat on my sunny doorway

00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:40.836
from sunrise 'til noon wrapped
in a reverie amidst the pines

00:46:40.836 --> 00:46:44.409
and hickories and sumacs in
undisturbed solitude and

00:46:44.409 --> 00:46:47.586
stillness,
while the birds sang around or

00:46:47.586 --> 00:46:51.626
flitted noiselessly through the
house until the sun falling in

00:46:51.626 --> 00:46:55.665
at my west window or the noise
of some traveler's wagon on the

00:46:55.665 --> 00:46:59.440
distant highway I was reminded
of the lapse of time.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:03.159
I grew in those seasons like
corn in the night,

00:47:03.159 --> 00:47:08.092
and they were far better than
any work of the hands would have

00:47:08.092 --> 00:47:11.834
been.
They were not time subtracted

00:47:11.834 --> 00:47:16.201
from my life,
but so much over and above my

00:47:16.201 --> 00:47:22.082
usual allowance.
I hope that your summer will

00:47:22.082 --> 00:47:27.951
have a lot of time like that.
I hope that that time might

00:47:27.951 --> 00:47:33.090
also have latitude for reading,
and that reading will be not

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:37.010
only what you have been now
trained to do,

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:41.038
which is reading that is
informed--if it's contemporary

00:47:41.038 --> 00:47:45.588
novels you're reading--informed
about where these writers come

00:47:45.588 --> 00:47:48.096
from,
what kinds of projects they

00:47:48.096 --> 00:47:51.291
might be busy with,
what kinds of questions they

00:47:51.291 --> 00:47:55.517
might be responding to,
but also that it will give you

00:47:55.517 --> 00:48:00.514
time to enter into and pretend
with Nabokov--and remember back

00:48:00.514 --> 00:48:04.938
to the beginning of the
course--to pretend with Nabokov

00:48:04.938 --> 00:48:09.690
that you can climb a mountain of
the imagination and meet a

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:14.769
reader there and forget all the
kinds of context that I've been

00:48:14.769 --> 00:48:18.210
teaching you to pay attention
to.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:22.795
Because it's in that meeting in
the imagination that I think

00:48:22.795 --> 00:48:26.369
literature can most powerfully
speak to you.

00:48:26.369 --> 00:48:56.000
So, I hope you will go and have
that kind of summer.

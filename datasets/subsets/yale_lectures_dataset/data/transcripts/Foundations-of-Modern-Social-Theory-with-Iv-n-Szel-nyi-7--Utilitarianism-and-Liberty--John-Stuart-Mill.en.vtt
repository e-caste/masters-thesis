00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.019
Prof: So Adam Smith.
 

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:07.550
And this is what I want to rush
quickly through.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.812
His life--we don't really know
all that much about his life,

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:17.540
and it is not as colorful as
Jean Jacques Rousseau.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.138
And then his major
contributions:

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:25.174
his theory of self-interest and
how self-interest is related to

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:28.669
the common good,
his labor theory of value,

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.659
his idea of distribution of
value between labor capital and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.521
rent,
and finally (what is the most

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.540
often cited) with his theory of
the invisible hand.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.740
So here it is, Adam Smith.
 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.449
About his life,
he was born in 1723 in

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.062
Scotland, Kirkcaldy,
just outside of Edinburgh,

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:56.070
which is a beautiful city.
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.980
If you did not visit it yet,
I recommend that you do.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.380
He entered the University of
Glasgow,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.519
and interestingly at that time,
in the mid-eighteenth century,

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.045
for reasons which is beyond me,
next to Paris and in a way

00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:13.944
London,
Edinburgh was the center of the

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:16.349
Scottish Enlightenment.
 

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:23.280
Then he also went to Oxford,
in Balliol College,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.360
and in 1751 he was appointed at
the University of Glasgow as a--

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.879
Glasgow I would not recommend
as a tourist destination,

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.360
by the way
&gt;

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.849
--he became a professor of
logic, and then he became a

00:01:42.849 --> 00:01:47.822
professor of moral philosophy,
believe it or not.

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:48.860
Right?
 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.819
The person who is known about
self-interest and the invisible

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.715
hand, his major first job was
professor of moral philosophy,

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:57.640
of ethics.
 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.441
And, in 1759,
he published a book,

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:04.941
the book called The Theory
of Moral Sentiments,

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:07.489
which is a book on ethics.
 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:13.215
Well we will see this is a big
issue, whether this book was

00:02:13.215 --> 00:02:17.510
written out of expediency;
he wrote it just because he

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.800
wanted to justify that he's a
professor of moral philosophy

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.598
and he didn't really believe in
it because he was an economist,

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:29.110
a rational choice economist,
or was he really a moralist?

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.687
That's one of the big questions
I think what scholars on Adam

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.639
Smith are debating.
 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.729
He traveled in Europe,
and this may have been a

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:41.610
turning point in his life.
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.268
He meets Voltaire and Quesnay,
a major economist of his time,

00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:48.440
and other representatives of
French Enlightenment.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.901
And French Enlightenment may
have actually influenced him and

00:02:53.901 --> 00:02:58.997
pushed him, after the return of
Glasgow, to Kirkcaldy for

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:01.498
awhile;
he went back and that's where

00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:04.808
he mainly wrote The Wealth of
Nations, and that's the most

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:05.740
important book.
 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.979
But I think in order to
understand Adam Smith,

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:15.372
we have to come to terms with
the apparent tension between

00:03:15.372 --> 00:03:18.587
The Theory of Moral
Sentiments and The Wealth

00:03:18.587 --> 00:03:19.720
of Nations.
 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.353
Is this the same author,
or these are two different

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:24.080
authors?
 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.182
Is it the same theory,
or there are two different

00:03:27.182 --> 00:03:28.800
theories offered to us?
 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.129
And that's I think very
complicated.

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.440
He passed away in 1790.
 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.456
Well I wanted to find you some
figures about--pictures about

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.020
his life.
 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.785
The only thing what I could
find is a memorial on the site

00:03:41.785 --> 00:03:46.466
where the house stood in
Kirkcaldy, where he wrote The

00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:48.639
Wealth of Nations.
 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.512
So it's not only Yale
University which is turning

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:54.592
buildings down;
even the British do turn all

00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:57.763
buildings down,
even if they should not have

00:03:57.763 --> 00:03:58.352
done so.
 

00:03:58.352 --> 00:03:59.090
Right?
 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.163
It would be so nice to visit
the house where The Wealth of

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:04.930
Nations was written.
 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.415
But if you go to Kirkcaldy,
well you can visit that site

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.128
and to have a look.
 

00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:14.875
Okay, so as I said,
Adam Smith seemed to have two

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:15.500
faces.
 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.100
Regularly, normally today,
if you take economics classes,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.062
he is presented as the person
who is advocating the

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:32.721
self-interested individual and a
committed theorist of the

00:04:32.721 --> 00:04:37.038
self-regulating markets,
of the invisible hand-- as

00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:40.875
little government as possible,
pursue just your self-interest,

00:04:40.875 --> 00:04:44.410
and your self-interest will
lead to the common good.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.269
So he is the sort of
inspiration for neoclassical

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:52.692
economics and rational choice
theory, and methodological

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.750
individualism,
to put it this way.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.511
But he has this book,
The Theory of Moral

00:04:59.511 --> 00:05:03.273
Sentiments,
in which he is writing about

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:08.259
sympathy as an important
motivation for human action.

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.757
And is this just a concession
to his job, or is there

00:05:12.757 --> 00:05:18.204
something deep in him which also
saw the need for a helping hand

00:05:18.204 --> 00:05:20.800
by the public authorities?
 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.610
That's the big puzzle we have
to struggle with.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.084
Well there are other people who
are more qualified to give you

00:05:29.084 --> 00:05:31.649
the most authentic
interpretation of Smith.

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:34.500
I'll try to do my best. Okay?
 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.730
Well and indeed The Wealth
of Nations looks like about

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.470
self-interested individuals and
the invisible hand.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.860
I will present you enough
citations that you see it.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.540
I will also show you why it is
possible.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.158
Some of Smith's interpreters
will suggest that this is the

00:05:55.158 --> 00:05:58.065
same Mill,
and in fact The Wealth of

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.375
Nations is just an extension
of The Theory of Moral

00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:04.112
Sentiments,
rather than a contradiction to

00:06:04.112 --> 00:06:04.329
it.
 

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:07.134
This is not the majority view.
 

00:06:07.134 --> 00:06:07.790
Right?
 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.593
Today, among economists in
particular, the majority view is

00:06:11.593 --> 00:06:15.593
that you should not really pay
much attention to The Theory

00:06:15.593 --> 00:06:17.430
of Moral Sentiments.
 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.836
The Wealth of Nations
gives you the real source

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:26.814
and inspiration,
and this is what guides

00:06:26.814 --> 00:06:29.569
neoclassical economics.
 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:33.279
But you may find some
economists who disagree,

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:38.812
and you will find a number of
political philosophers who will

00:06:38.812 --> 00:06:44.437
disagree and will say that this
is not the real Adam Smith who

00:06:44.437 --> 00:06:49.139
is presented to you by
neoclassical economists.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.589
And I don't want to take a
position in this.

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:58.560
I'm not sufficiently a Smith
scholar to be able to do so.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.170
But I will present you the
argument both ways,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.420
and you can make up your mind
where you stand on this.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.817
So The Theory of Moral
Sentiments--just very

00:07:07.817 --> 00:07:09.379
briefly what this is.
 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:13.899
He does ask the central
question: How can we make moral

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:14.819
judgment?
 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:20.420
How can we tell good from evil,
good for bad?

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.660
Well it's a very important
issue and question.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:30.096
Many founding theorists of
modern social theory were

00:07:30.096 --> 00:07:32.230
dealing with this.
 

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:36.199
The most important one,
we will talk about him at

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:40.252
great--in fifteen minutes--is
Frederick Nietzsche,

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:43.629
of course;
the genealogy of morals.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:48.930
This is the central question:
Where does our conception of

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.350
good and evil come from?
 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.050
But Adam Smith already here
asked this question,

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:55.947
and he said,
well "what's the

00:07:55.947 --> 00:07:57.040
solution?"
 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:01.370
That inside you there is an
inner person.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:03.399
You are two people.
 

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:07.425
You act, and there is somebody
inside you who is watching you,

00:08:07.425 --> 00:08:11.189
and that inside you will tell
you, "You did something

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.596
wrong;
that was not the right thing to

00:08:13.596 --> 00:08:14.160
do."
 

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.949
And I think you should be able
to relate to this.

00:08:19.949 --> 00:08:21.649
I can.
 

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:25.593
There is very often inner self,
in myself, which tells me that

00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:28.889
was a mistake I did,
that was a foolish thing I did,

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:30.829
I should not have done so.
 

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:39.750
I know people who have a very
small impartial internal

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.769
spectator.
 

00:08:41.769 --> 00:08:46.537
I know people who have very
great difficulties telling ever

00:08:46.537 --> 00:08:48.509
that I made a mistake.
 

00:08:48.509 --> 00:08:52.464
There are some people who
always blame others if things go

00:08:52.464 --> 00:08:53.019
wrong.
 

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:58.289
Well I think they have a moral
problem, I would say.

00:08:58.289 --> 00:08:59.899
So what about yourself?
 

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:03.924
You may have a moral problem if
your inner self never tells you

00:09:03.924 --> 00:09:07.042
that you were wrong,
and you are always liking to

00:09:07.042 --> 00:09:09.509
blame others if things went
wrong.

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:13.080
Then you have a problem,
an ethical problem;

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.664
at least this is Adam Smith's
argument.

00:09:15.664 --> 00:09:16.210
Right?
 

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.879
Simple and persuasive.
 

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:24.778
Then he says--this is something
which is kind of inspired by

00:09:24.778 --> 00:09:27.980
Hobbes--we are led by passion.
 

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.970
But now he is not emphasizing
fear.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.288
He said, "also by
sympathy."

00:09:33.288 --> 00:09:36.505
That's crucial,
and that's the crucial notion

00:09:36.505 --> 00:09:41.111
for those who emphasize that in
fact Adam Smith in The Wealth

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:45.426
of Nations is the same Adam
Smith as in The Theory of

00:09:45.426 --> 00:09:47.399
Moral Sentiments.
 

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:51.249
Because Adam Smith,
those who argue for one Adam

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:54.279
Smith rather than two Adam
Smiths,

00:09:54.279 --> 00:09:59.192
say that he has a theory of
humans which is a sympathetic

00:09:59.192 --> 00:10:00.860
theory of humans.
 

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.220
What drives us,
that we have sympathy for

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.672
others, other people's
sympathies, that in interacting

00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:12.870
with others we are seeking other
people's sympathy.

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:13.879
Right?
 

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:16.700
We try to please people.
 

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.509
We want to impress people.
 

00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:24.053
We want to have a reputation;
we want to have a good

00:10:24.053 --> 00:10:24.639
reputation.
 

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:27.120
We want to act honorably.
 

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.940
So we are seeking sympathy.
 

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.885
We have a sympathy--we have an
understanding of other people's

00:10:33.885 --> 00:10:37.250
human conditions--but we are
also expecting others to

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.998
understand us and value us.
 

00:10:38.998 --> 00:10:39.710
Right?
 

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.000
And I think this is a very
important and intriguing idea,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
which I will show,
try to show you later on,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.918
may not be completely
inconsistent by the idea that

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:55.916
seeking self-interest is leading
to the common good.

00:10:55.916 --> 00:10:56.700
Right?
 

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:03.020
Because indeed,
if self-interest implies that I

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:09.480
also want others to respect and
evaluate me,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.897
the self-interest also implies
that I want to do good to

00:11:13.897 --> 00:11:14.620
others.
 

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.214
This is in your self-interest,
that you can say at the end of

00:11:18.214 --> 00:11:20.730
the day, "I am a good
person."

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.125
Then, in fact,
pursuing these self-interests

00:11:25.125 --> 00:11:31.259
may not be all that different
from the common good because it

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:33.100
is inside you.
 

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.903
And this, I think,
is the way how he is being

00:11:35.903 --> 00:11:36.350
read.
 

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:41.323
And he introduces the notion
for the first time of the

00:11:41.323 --> 00:11:47.519
concept invisible hand in The
Theory of Moral Sentiments.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:51.988
But here the invisible hand is
not what you are told Adam

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:55.340
Smith's theory of the invisible
hand is.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:58.320
It's not the laissez-faire free
market.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.940
It's the hand of God. Right?
 

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:06.639
God guides us to have a proper
balance between passion and

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:12.538
sympathy, and that is somehow
God's will, what we follow.

00:12:12.538 --> 00:12:16.379
In fact, I will talk about this
later on.

00:12:16.379 --> 00:12:21.690
A big deal is made out of Adam
Smith's theory of the invisible

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:22.298
hand.
 

00:12:22.298 --> 00:12:25.518
The term, the word,
invisible hand,

00:12:25.518 --> 00:12:29.493
the term, comes up three times
in his work.

00:12:29.493 --> 00:12:30.440
Right?
 

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.600
And in each time he's using it
in a different meaning.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.216
The way how we understand
invisible hand comes from a

00:12:40.216 --> 00:12:42.793
section once,
in one sentence,

00:12:42.793 --> 00:12:45.990
in The Wealth of
Nations.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:51.616
And in fact it is specifically
about foreign trade and

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:56.327
international trade,
not about the role of the

00:12:56.327 --> 00:13:01.144
government in domestic affairs,
but it's about free trade,

00:13:01.144 --> 00:13:02.970
free international trade.
 

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:07.328
And this is the context in
which he's using the invisible

00:13:07.328 --> 00:13:11.845
hand, as it is being interpreted
mostly today by Adam Smith

00:13:11.845 --> 00:13:12.623
theorists.
 

00:13:12.623 --> 00:13:13.480
Right?
 

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.178
So it's intriguing, isn't it?
 

00:13:15.178 --> 00:13:19.341
Watch yourself when you are
coining a term because a term

00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:23.951
occasionally can stick and then
it will be always attributed to

00:13:23.951 --> 00:13:27.273
you,
even if you use it once in your

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:27.700
life.
 

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.298
Okay?
 

00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:30.940
Well The Wealth of
Nations.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.110
Well these are kind of the
Table of Contents.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:38.306
He writes about the division of
labor and determination of

00:13:38.306 --> 00:13:40.808
prices, accumulation of capital.
 

00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:44.138
He writes about the evaluation
of societies:

00:13:44.138 --> 00:13:48.548
hunting, raising agriculture,
and commercial societies.

00:13:48.548 --> 00:13:52.830
He never used the term
capitalism;

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:57.019
modern economy was commercial
industrial society for him.

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:01.750
And then he offers a criticism
of mercantilism.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.900
That's where he offers an
argument for free international

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.940
trade, and that's where he
introduces the notion of the

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.009
invisible hand.
 

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:13.565
And then something is on
taxation, what I will not talk

00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:14.240
about.
 

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.820
So self-interest and the common
good;

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:21.494
one of the big issues we have
to discuss when we are faced

00:14:21.494 --> 00:14:22.970
with Adam Smith.
 

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:27.206
And the arguments are if you
are interacting with each other,

00:14:27.206 --> 00:14:29.043
do not expect benevolence.
 

00:14:29.043 --> 00:14:29.678
Right?
 

00:14:29.678 --> 00:14:33.820
Do not expect that somebody
else will be charitable to you.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.678
There is also saying if you are
seeking

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:40.740
self-interest--specifically in
the citations I have;

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.000
for instance,
choosing your employment.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.913
If you chose it rationally,
this will be in the common

00:14:45.913 --> 00:14:46.298
good.
 

00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:49.655
And I will try to explain why
you seeking self-interest in

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:53.013
finding the job which is best
for you is also the best for

00:14:53.013 --> 00:14:53.720
society.
 

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.143
And then he says,
well the individuals are the

00:14:57.143 --> 00:15:01.480
better judges of their own
interests than any statement or

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.470
lawgiver.
 

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:05.596
As little state as
possible--that's where it is

00:15:05.596 --> 00:15:09.269
coming from, and we will see how
he argues the case.

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:11.759
So do not expect benevolence.
 

00:15:11.759 --> 00:15:18.879
Okay, this is a very frequently
cited sentence from Adam Smith.

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:24.168
It's not in the text I assigned
for this course.

00:15:24.168 --> 00:15:27.850
Well, "It is not the
benevolence of the butcher,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:32.548
the brewer, or the baker that
we expect our dinner from,

00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:38.230
but the very self-interest of
the butcher."

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:44.236
I go to the restaurant,
I do not expect the cook to

00:15:44.236 --> 00:15:51.565
prepare me a good meal because I
need a good meal and I expect

00:15:51.565 --> 00:15:53.967
the cook to like me.
 

00:15:53.967 --> 00:15:55.288
Right?
 

00:15:55.288 --> 00:16:00.440
I want him to cook a good meal
because then I will give a tip.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.794
It is in the self-interest of
the waiter to serve me well and

00:16:04.794 --> 00:16:06.320
serve me good food.
 

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.580
Otherwise I will not go back
again and I will not give a tip.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:12.048
I will punish.
 

00:16:12.048 --> 00:16:16.813
It is appealing to the
self-interest of the person for

00:16:16.813 --> 00:16:21.308
whom I expect something,
and not is benevolence.

00:16:21.308 --> 00:16:27.707
Well he said well we address
ourselves not to the humanity of

00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:33.679
the people, not to their
self-love, but we want people to

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:36.558
take advantage of this.
 

00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:39.515
This is an interesting issue,
by the way, even in everyday

00:16:39.515 --> 00:16:39.879
life.
 

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:44.962
I'm sure in this room there are
people who think about this

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.190
differently.
 

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.940
Just to give you a very
personalized example.

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.370
My wife occasionally tells me,
"This person is not a good

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.658
friend of yours because this
person only calls you when that

00:16:58.658 --> 00:17:00.620
person needs you."
 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.399
And this does happen.
 

00:17:03.399 --> 00:17:07.740
And my answer always is--and I
think in this way,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.566
deep in my heart,
I'm a Smithian--"I don't

00:17:10.566 --> 00:17:13.497
want friends,
I don't want anybody,

00:17:13.497 --> 00:17:18.318
who do not see an advantage in
interacting with me.

00:17:18.318 --> 00:17:24.772
I want people who actually act
out of self-interest seeking my

00:17:24.772 --> 00:17:26.358
relationship.
 

00:17:26.358 --> 00:17:31.432
It will be a bad relationship
if my friends always think that

00:17:31.432 --> 00:17:35.414
it cost them to talk to me,
and they do not benefit from

00:17:35.414 --> 00:17:37.016
the relationship with me."
 

00:17:37.016 --> 00:17:37.430
Right?
 

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.548
I don't want my children just
to act out of love and sort of

00:17:42.548 --> 00:17:45.239
be a pain in the neck for them.
 

00:17:45.239 --> 00:17:46.019
Right?
 

00:17:46.019 --> 00:17:51.327
I want my children to see that
having me as a father is

00:17:51.327 --> 00:17:53.490
beneficial for them.
 

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.230
That's a good relationship.
 

00:17:56.230 --> 00:18:00.740
Good relationships are always
based on self-interest.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:06.102
You don't want to have a lover
who does not enjoy being your

00:18:06.102 --> 00:18:06.828
lover.
 

00:18:06.828 --> 00:18:14.278
Therefore you want people
acting out of self-interest.

00:18:14.278 --> 00:18:18.210
And I think that's what he's
getting at here.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:23.220
He said even the beggar--here
actually the citation says,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.736
"The beggars are the ones
who are dependent only upon

00:18:26.736 --> 00:18:27.970
benevolence."
 

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.599
But then he qualifies it,
he says, "But even for the

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:32.618
beggar it is not quite
true." Right?

00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:35.759
The beggar will make some
tricks in which,

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:39.663
in fact, actually will appeal
to your self-interest,

00:18:39.663 --> 00:18:43.109
that you are a charitable
person or what.

00:18:43.109 --> 00:18:45.068
Now self-interest in employment.
 

00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:47.538
He said well it's a very good
example.

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:50.123
He said when you are choosing
an occupation,

00:18:50.123 --> 00:18:53.188
of course you want to have a
big job, you want to be

00:18:53.188 --> 00:18:53.788
well-paid.
 

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:54.450
Right?
 

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.259
Those of you who are an
economics major,

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:04.090
you may want to have some nice
job at some brokerage firm in

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.851
Wall Street,
and with a Yale Bachelor's

00:19:07.851 --> 00:19:12.522
Degree you would like to earn
$100,000.00 a year.

00:19:12.522 --> 00:19:13.400
Right?
 

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.940
But why would you earn
$100,000.00?

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:21.857
Because the employer gets a lot
out of these skills what you get

00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:24.872
out of Yale,
and therefore it will be in the

00:19:24.872 --> 00:19:28.615
interest of the society that you
get the highest possible salary

00:19:28.615 --> 00:19:32.480
because you make the greatest
contribution to the common good;

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.623
otherwise you would not be paid
that high.

00:19:35.623 --> 00:19:36.160
Okay?
 

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.025
So therefore you will try to
find that occupation in which

00:19:40.025 --> 00:19:42.670
you get the highest possible
reward,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.107
but you will get only the
highest possible reward because

00:19:46.107 --> 00:19:48.808
you make the utmost contribution
you can,

00:19:48.808 --> 00:19:51.640
with your talent,
with your hard work,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.670
and with your skills,
to the common good.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.680
This is Adam Smith's argument.
 

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.317
It's a persuasive argument
actually.

00:19:59.317 --> 00:19:59.920
Right?
 

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:07.058
Well I can go on;
it's not all that important.

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:09.368
Now this is very important too,
I find.

00:20:09.368 --> 00:20:12.433
"Individuals are the
better judge of their own

00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:15.068
interests than anybody
else." Right?

00:20:15.068 --> 00:20:19.778
And well this is I think again
extremely important,

00:20:19.778 --> 00:20:25.147
and I'm sure this classroom is
divided fifty/fifty percent

00:20:25.147 --> 00:20:26.843
along these views.
 

00:20:26.843 --> 00:20:27.880
Right?
 

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:34.700
He said well the individuals in
the local situations are simply

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:41.298
better judges to what is their
interest than any statement or

00:20:41.298 --> 00:20:42.288
lawgiver.
 

00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:43.500
Right?
 

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.472
People should judge for
themselves what they want and it

00:20:47.472 --> 00:20:51.156
should not be a government which
imposes it on them.

00:20:51.156 --> 00:20:51.880
Right?
 

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.887
This is a big debate right now,
for instance about the

00:20:54.887 --> 00:20:57.500
healthcare insurance,
the healthcare reform.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.387
Should we let it up to people
to decide whether they want to

00:21:00.387 --> 00:21:01.710
have an insurance or not?
 

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:06.064
Should we expect people to be
individually responsible for

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:09.348
themselves, to take charge of
their life?

00:21:09.348 --> 00:21:12.904
Or should it be the government,
or should it be a statesman,

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.497
the lawgiver,
the Congress who takes care of

00:21:15.497 --> 00:21:16.160
people?
 

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:20.911
And he clearly takes a position
no, I think people are the best

00:21:20.911 --> 00:21:22.980
judges of their feelings.
 

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:26.279
Now the labor theory of value.
 

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:28.740
And let me rush through of it.
 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:29.910
This is important.
 

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:34.028
His point of departure comes
from John Locke,

00:21:34.028 --> 00:21:38.239
as we have seen,
and it is leading directly to

00:21:38.239 --> 00:21:39.548
Karl Marx.
 

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:44.092
Karl Marx radicalizes his
position, but the point of

00:21:44.092 --> 00:21:47.118
departure is clearly Adam Smith.
 

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:50.176
And the argument about the
labor theory of value:

00:21:50.176 --> 00:21:52.788
the labor is the measure of all
values.

00:21:52.788 --> 00:21:55.565
And then he said,
"The whole produce belongs

00:21:55.565 --> 00:21:56.779
to the labor."
 

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:00.009
And so far Marx completely
agrees with him;

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:03.318
and we will see when we will be
discussing Marx.

00:22:03.318 --> 00:22:07.353
But then he departs from it
because he asks the question,

00:22:07.353 --> 00:22:10.450
where does the profit and rent
come from?

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:15.440
Marx asked this question as
well, and he says exploitation;

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.798
those who earn profit exploit
the workers.

00:22:18.798 --> 00:22:21.598
But Adam Smith has a different
view.

00:22:21.598 --> 00:22:26.580
He says well those who will
lend capital and those who offer

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.788
land also deserve part of the
value.

00:22:29.788 --> 00:22:33.692
Now let's see how this
contradiction can be resolved,

00:22:33.692 --> 00:22:35.868
how he's dealing with this.
 

00:22:35.868 --> 00:22:40.009
How can that all value is
created by labor and belongs to

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:43.346
the laborer,
and nevertheless the capitalist

00:22:43.346 --> 00:22:47.660
pockets profit and the landowner
pockets rent for the land?

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:54.963
Then here this is very much
John Locke: "The value of

00:22:54.963 --> 00:23:02.140
any commodity belongs to the
person who possesses it,

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:11.480
and if it is not for use or
consumption but exchange,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.702
then the value of this
commodity is equal to the amount

00:23:14.702 --> 00:23:17.509
of labor which has to be put
into this."

00:23:17.509 --> 00:23:19.480
"Labor is therefore,"
he said,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.220
"the real measure of the
exchangeable value of all

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.465
commodities."
 

00:23:24.465 --> 00:23:25.088
Right?
 

00:23:25.088 --> 00:23:28.729
Commodities can have a use
value, they can be very useful,

00:23:28.729 --> 00:23:32.558
and they can have very little
labor in it, like fresh air;

00:23:32.558 --> 00:23:38.352
though by now we know fresh air
needs quite a bit of labor too.

00:23:38.352 --> 00:23:39.098
Right?
 

00:23:39.098 --> 00:23:41.544
But the exchange,
how the exchange it,

00:23:41.544 --> 00:23:43.790
will be guided,
according to Smith,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:44.650
by labor.
 

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.359
Few people accept today the
labor theory of value;

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:49.500
Smith or Marx, no matter what.
 

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.038
And it belongs to the whole
laborer.

00:23:52.038 --> 00:23:53.930
This is a very interesting
argument.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.720
He said--and this is again John
Locke--

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:01.269
"The property of every man
is his own labor,

00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:05.970
and therefore every value is
created by this labor,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:12.074
and therefore it has to belong
to the person who owns the

00:24:12.074 --> 00:24:13.598
labor."
 

00:24:13.598 --> 00:24:14.940
"But."
 

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:19.798
he said, "this is true for
societies before capital is

00:24:19.798 --> 00:24:24.657
being accumulated and before
land is privately owned."

00:24:24.657 --> 00:24:25.578
Right?
 

00:24:25.578 --> 00:24:29.231
So this is really an argument
for ancient societies,

00:24:29.231 --> 00:24:33.529
without capital accumulation
and without private ownership of

00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:34.460
the land.
 

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.586
In these conditions,
if there is no capital

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:40.640
accumulation and no private
ownership,

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.164
land is commonly owned,
then the whole produced labor

00:24:44.164 --> 00:24:45.858
belongs to the laborer.
 

00:24:45.858 --> 00:24:49.597
This is where he,
Marx, will depart dramatically

00:24:49.597 --> 00:24:51.029
from Adam Smith.
 

00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:53.779
So where does the profit and
rent come?

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:58.410
Well are capitalists simply
exploiting the workers?

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:01.390
He said, "No,
there is a distribution of

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.301
value between labor,
capital and rent."

00:25:04.301 --> 00:25:04.980
Right?
 

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:12.432
And this is reasonable,
because the capitalist offers

00:25:12.432 --> 00:25:17.200
capital in order--
in fact, advances capital to

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.711
the laborer,
takes risks with this

00:25:19.711 --> 00:25:23.710
advancement of the capital,
supervises the labor

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:29.690
process--and therefore it should
claim some profit from capital;

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.410
otherwise would be a fool not
to advance its capital.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.788
And the same goes for land
actually.

00:25:38.788 --> 00:25:43.115
Landowners also will have to
give the land a site in which

00:25:43.115 --> 00:25:47.516
production takes place,
and therefore they really

00:25:47.516 --> 00:25:52.369
should be able to collect some
rent on this land.

00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:55.720
Well finally the invisible hand.
 

00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.310
There are three conceptions of
this--I briefly pointed this

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:04.190
out-- in The Theory of Moral
Sentiments.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.869
He said this is really God
which gives us a sense of

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:13.460
sympathy and creates a balance
between passion,

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:19.085
desires, and hunger for more,
and self-restraint to respect

00:26:19.085 --> 00:26:22.480
others and earn respect from
others.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.450
Right?
 

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.209
And then, of course,
in The Wealth of

00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:30.098
Nations, this appears to be
the free marketplace.

00:26:30.098 --> 00:26:34.525
And then finally he had a
manuscript, History of

00:26:34.525 --> 00:26:38.420
Astronomy,
and he said the invisible hand

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:43.493
is the hand of Jupiter;
the hand of Jupiter because

00:26:43.493 --> 00:26:48.075
people,
as long as they are ignorant,

00:26:48.075 --> 00:26:51.330
phenomena--
lightening for instance,

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.710
what they don't--
cannot explain--attribute to

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.194
the will of Jupiter.
 

00:26:56.194 --> 00:26:56.789
Right?
 

00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:59.737
Superstition;
the invisible hand is

00:26:59.737 --> 00:27:00.584
superstition.
 

00:27:00.584 --> 00:27:01.038
Okay?
 

00:27:01.038 --> 00:27:04.740
So what is fun,
that three instances where the

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.028
notion of the invisible hand is
used,

00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:12.055
in each case a different
meaning, and in none of the

00:27:12.055 --> 00:27:16.950
cases exactly the same meaning
as we normally understand it.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:26.089
Okay, I think I'm now moving
over to John Stuart Mill,

00:27:26.089 --> 00:27:30.230
and to utilitarianism.
 

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:43.875
And he's a wonderful man and
makes a lot

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:58.568
of--&lt;&lt;technical
adjustment&gt;&gt;

00:27:58.568 --> 00:28:06.229
Okay, so this is all about
utilitarianism and liberty,

00:28:06.229 --> 00:28:14.900
and the long road from Jeremy
Bentham to John Stuart Mill.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:20.007
Utilitarianism is a
fundamentally important

00:28:20.007 --> 00:28:21.710
proposition.
 

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.713
It informs modern economic
theory, and it informs political

00:28:26.713 --> 00:28:32.236
and social theories which are in
the kind of rational choice mode

00:28:32.236 --> 00:28:33.788
of theorizing.
 

00:28:33.788 --> 00:28:38.880
And the point of departure is
Bentham,

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:42.653
who in many ways is the
Founding Father of

00:28:42.653 --> 00:28:46.642
utilitarianism,
though he never used the term,

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:51.538
and he influenced the life of
John Stuart Mill in a major way.

00:28:51.538 --> 00:28:56.880
Mill's father was James Mill,
quite an intellectual.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:03.923
He wrote a big three volume
history of India and the British

00:29:03.923 --> 00:29:06.670
involvement in India.
 

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:11.153
He met Bentham in 1808 and he
fell in love with the theory of

00:29:11.153 --> 00:29:14.441
utilitarianism,
and he asked him to supervise

00:29:14.441 --> 00:29:17.578
the education of his son--what
he did.

00:29:17.578 --> 00:29:22.497
And sort of poor John Stuart
Mill grew up under the influence

00:29:22.497 --> 00:29:26.759
of a very strong father and a
very strong teacher.

00:29:26.759 --> 00:29:31.868
And he invented the term,
John Stuart Mill,

00:29:31.868 --> 00:29:38.558
the term utilitarianism in
1822, at a very young age.

00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:42.598
Then he suffers a nervous
breakdown.

00:29:42.598 --> 00:29:45.656
When you see what
utilitarianism is,

00:29:45.656 --> 00:29:49.659
you will not wonder;
I mean, if you are really a

00:29:49.659 --> 00:29:53.432
strict utilitarian,
difficult to survive without a

00:29:53.432 --> 00:29:55.048
nervous breakdown.
 

00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:58.598
All right, so what is Bentham's
theory?

00:29:58.598 --> 00:30:04.286
He published a book,
The Principles of Morals and

00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:09.080
Legislation,
in 1789, and there are some

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.430
very important claims in this
book.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:18.077
And at first instance they
sound very reasonable,

00:30:18.077 --> 00:30:22.048
but he may be pushing his luck
too far.

00:30:22.048 --> 00:30:25.959
He said, "Well we are
created to seek pleasure and to

00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:29.076
avoid pain,
and therefore if we can

00:30:29.076 --> 00:30:33.390
minimize the pain and maximize
the pleasure,

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:36.150
that's when we achieve the
greatest happiness."

00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:39.144
That's what will be called
utility.

00:30:39.144 --> 00:30:39.848
Right?
 

00:30:39.848 --> 00:30:43.784
So action is right if it is
leading to happiness.

00:30:43.784 --> 00:30:44.440
Right?
 

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.269
We all want to be happy.
 

00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:53.328
Okay, well and this can be
actually quantified.

00:30:53.328 --> 00:30:55.970
The action is right,
morally right,

00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:00.009
if the sum of pleasures minus
the sum of pains,

00:31:00.009 --> 00:31:04.579
multiplied by the number of
persons affected by action is

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:05.315
positive.
 

00:31:05.315 --> 00:31:06.049
Right?
 

00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:09.058
Sounds reasonable, right?
 

00:31:09.058 --> 00:31:11.900
If more people are happy in
society than unhappy,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.208
then the society does as well
as it can.

00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:14.799
Right?
 

00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:17.950
That's really the argument.
 

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:21.240
Well there are a couple of
citations.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.150
I don't want to dwell on this
too long.

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.440
I will put it on the web;
and it's not in the text I

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.210
require from you to read.
 

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.146
So, he said,
"The two big masters are

00:31:33.146 --> 00:31:37.689
pain and pleasure";
somewhat a kind of similar

00:31:37.689 --> 00:31:39.750
argument to Hobbes.
 

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.115
And he said,
"An action may be said to

00:31:43.115 --> 00:31:47.284
be conformable with the
principle of utility when the

00:31:47.284 --> 00:31:50.328
tendency is to augment
happiness,

00:31:50.328 --> 00:31:56.470
and that is greater than to
diminish it."

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:57.970
And what is utility?
 

00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:03.463
"Utility is that principle
which approves or disapproves a

00:32:03.463 --> 00:32:09.046
reaction to augment or diminish
the happiness of the party whose

00:32:09.046 --> 00:32:11.704
interest is in question."
 

00:32:11.704 --> 00:32:12.680
Right?
 

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.715
This is a notion of utility
which is not all that far away

00:32:15.715 --> 00:32:18.220
what economists are using,
even at this time.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:21.588
Then here comes something what
I think nobody would accept now,

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:24.113
that's simply--he said,
"Well it's easy therefore

00:32:24.113 --> 00:32:25.161
to calculate it."
 

00:32:25.161 --> 00:32:25.588
Right?
 

00:32:25.588 --> 00:32:29.690
And I already pointed this out,
you just count the number of

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.608
people who are happy and who
have pain,

00:32:32.608 --> 00:32:36.800
and count the number of people
who are happy with it and have

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:38.981
pleasure,
and if more people have

00:32:38.981 --> 00:32:42.250
pleasure, the sum total of
pleasure exceeds the sum total

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:44.798
of pains,
then you got the good society.

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:48.190
That's utilitarianism
à la Bentham.

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.599
Well John Stuart Mill--here he
is.

00:32:52.599 --> 00:32:57.200
He was born in London.
 

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.368
He never attended school;
he was a lucky one.

00:33:00.368 --> 00:33:05.423
But not necessarily all that
lucky because his teacher was

00:33:05.423 --> 00:33:09.400
Bentham and John Mill,
who were tough people,

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.798
and he had to start learning
Latin and Greek when he was

00:33:13.798 --> 00:33:15.318
three-years-old.
 

00:33:15.318 --> 00:33:21.930
Well if there are anybody who
is Asian-American in the room,

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:26.190
Chinese, you may have to start
actually to learn how to read

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.788
and write in Chinese pretty
early.

00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:33.257
But he did this with Latin and
Greek which to my mind is a big

00:33:33.257 --> 00:33:37.140
easier than to learn all the
characters in Chinese.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.615
Anyway, '22,
he established the Utilitarian

00:33:39.615 --> 00:33:42.740
Society and invents the term
utilitarianism.

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:45.538
And then he suffers a nervous
breakdown;

00:33:45.538 --> 00:33:48.940
I mean, two domineering people
in his life.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:54.445
And then he also becomes very
sort of unhappy with the

00:33:54.445 --> 00:33:58.394
expediency emphasis on
utilitarianism--

00:33:58.394 --> 00:34:03.588
instrumentalism,
the coldness of the argument.

00:34:03.588 --> 00:34:09.268
He's actually becoming--becomes
interested in poetry.

00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:14.625
And then he meets Harriet
Taylor, a wonderful lady,

00:34:14.625 --> 00:34:19.231
and a friendship,
a very close friendship is

00:34:19.231 --> 00:34:20.409
formed.
 

00:34:20.409 --> 00:34:26.360
Harriet Taylor was a fantastic
intellectual,

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:32.275
as far as we can judge;
one of the very first radical

00:34:32.275 --> 00:34:37.442
feminists, and had a probably
extraordinary impact on the work

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.389
of John Stuart Mill.
 

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:44.434
If he would have been a real
feminist, he probably should

00:34:44.434 --> 00:34:49.210
have put on his work Harriet
Taylor as a co-author;

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.199
she probably co-authored this
work.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:56.356
I mean, she was married,
and this was an interesting

00:34:56.356 --> 00:34:58.719
triangle which did develop.
 

00:34:58.719 --> 00:35:02.947
I mean, in what way we don't
quite know, but they were

00:35:02.947 --> 00:35:05.820
traveling together,
the threefold;

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.840
anyway, quite interesting.
 

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.690
What can I say?
 

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:15.681
Well '51, Mr. Taylor passes
away, and then John Stuart Mill

00:35:15.681 --> 00:35:19.039
immediately marries Harriet
Taylor.

00:35:19.039 --> 00:35:23.472
But unfortunately she has a
very short life and dies after a

00:35:23.472 --> 00:35:24.750
short marriage.
 

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:29.190
So his undisturbed happiness,
to put it this way,

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:34.369
did not last very long,
and he died in '73 in Avignon.

00:35:34.369 --> 00:35:37.590
Now about the work, briefly.
 

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.322
We'll be talking about three
pieces of work On

00:35:41.322 --> 00:35:44.199
Liberty,
Utilitarianism.

00:35:44.199 --> 00:35:48.958
I will not talk about his role
as a member of parliament where

00:35:48.958 --> 00:35:54.110
actually he was one of the first
advocates for female suffrage,

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.784
which did not fly at that time,
and he even lost re-election

00:35:58.784 --> 00:36:03.460
probably because he's advocating
voting rights for women.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.976
And then he wrote,
'69, Subjection of

00:36:06.976 --> 00:36:10.637
Women,
which in many ways is a

00:36:10.637 --> 00:36:14.788
feminist book,
quite a radical feminist

00:36:14.788 --> 00:36:20.329
book--a feminist book you can
rarely read from a man,

00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:24.420
and especially not in 1869.
 

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.449
Okay, so what are his major
contributions?

00:36:29.449 --> 00:36:32.969
He redefines utilitarianism.
 

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:33.849
Right?
 

00:36:33.849 --> 00:36:36.159
As I said, he found it too cold.
 

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:39.949
He needed more sentiments.
 

00:36:39.949 --> 00:36:46.315
Poetry-- Harriet Taylor,
gave him a sense of the world

00:36:46.315 --> 00:36:50.159
which is richer in sentiments.
 

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:55.652
So he says, well there is
higher happiness.

00:36:55.652 --> 00:36:56.699
Right?
 

00:36:56.699 --> 00:36:59.449
There is a lower level of
happiness and there is a higher

00:36:59.449 --> 00:37:00.480
level of happiness.
 

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.969
To have a good steak,
well it is pleasurable.

00:37:05.969 --> 00:37:11.898
But to listen to the Ninth
Symphony of Beethoven,

00:37:11.898 --> 00:37:14.737
it's greater happiness.
 

00:37:14.737 --> 00:37:15.849
Right?
 

00:37:15.849 --> 00:37:19.940
It's a higher level of
happiness when you hear the

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:23.530
concluding chorale of the Ninth
Symphony.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.429
You are through the roof of
pleasure;

00:37:26.429 --> 00:37:31.954
you have a higher level of
happiness than eating a nice

00:37:31.954 --> 00:37:33.079
rare steak.
 

00:37:33.079 --> 00:37:34.000
Right?
 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.389
That's a higher level of
happiness.

00:37:36.389 --> 00:37:41.349
And he said--and nobody argues
it more forcefully than him--

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:45.289
"Individual liberty is the
ultimate value,

00:37:45.289 --> 00:37:48.829
and expediency"--and you
know what he means by

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:53.224
expediency,
that you get there by using the

00:37:53.224 --> 00:37:57.840
least means and you maximize the
return--

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:03.347
"expediency cannot justify
intervention against individual

00:38:03.347 --> 00:38:04.769
liberty."
 

00:38:04.769 --> 00:38:09.150
A very interesting issue;
a very accurate,

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.340
a very up-to-date issue.
 

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:20.753
Just think about 9/11;
this is exactly the problem of

00:38:20.753 --> 00:38:25.728
the 9/11--how much we can act
against individual liberty in

00:38:25.728 --> 00:38:29.789
the name of expediency;
how much we are willing to

00:38:29.789 --> 00:38:33.030
accept the limitations in
individual liberty?

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:38.518
And well we will see,
he said, expediency is not to

00:38:38.518 --> 00:38:43.896
be ignored, but when the chips
come down, he said,

00:38:43.896 --> 00:38:47.079
it is individual liberty.
 

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:48.980
He's a libertarian, right?
 

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:53.460
He is for the sanctity of the
liberty of the individual,

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:57.780
and he's the ultimate of
British individualism and the

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:01.039
sacredness of British
individualism.

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:04.860
And finally the third major
contribution.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:09.199
He said women's legal situation
resembles those of slaves;

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:12.070
they are only worse off than
slaves are.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:16.940
And he argues that in a very
articulate way.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.931
And women should have equal
rights in jobs,

00:39:19.931 --> 00:39:22.141
in public life,
the same kind of

00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:26.559
education--total confrontation
with Jean Jacques Rousseau.

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:31.641
But he believes that in
marriage they can create a

00:39:31.641 --> 00:39:34.650
friendship bond with males.
 

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:38.360
Well Harriet Freedman did not
quite agree with this.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.512
Though she married twice,
she both times did it probably

00:39:42.512 --> 00:39:43.570
reluctantly.
 

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.032
She did not believe in the
institution of the marriage,

00:39:48.032 --> 00:39:50.429
though she did marry twice.
 

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:56.331
Okay, well let me see whether I
can still do this,

00:39:56.331 --> 00:40:03.800
his stuff on utilitarianism,
and leave the rest for Tuesday.

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:06.480
I think I have some three more
minutes to go.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.351
The main themes in the work
Utilitarianism is the

00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:18.478
concept of higher happiness;
human beings have faculties for

00:40:18.478 --> 00:40:24.679
more elevated appetites than
animals have.

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:27.739
Then he talks about justice and
legality.

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:31.969
It's a very complex issue,
but where he thinks that the

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:35.809
law is a more restrictive notion
than justice,

00:40:35.809 --> 00:40:38.920
and he stands for the idea of
justice,

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:46.699
and shows some contradiction
between law and justice as such.

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:50.610
And then he talks about justice
and expediency--why justice

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.510
cannot be simply explained by
expediency.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:58.619
Well again something which
speaks very much to the issues

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:00.809
which are on our mind.
 

00:41:00.809 --> 00:41:07.871
Does expediency makes it just
that you torture an Al-Qaeda or

00:41:07.871 --> 00:41:11.302
a prisoner,
or a suspected Al-Qaeda

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:16.420
prisoner, to get information out
because this way you save lives?

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.507
Some people will say,
"Yes, this makes it

00:41:19.507 --> 00:41:20.400
just."
 

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:23.081
Others will say, "No,
it is unjust,

00:41:23.081 --> 00:41:26.851
and therefore expediency--
you should not use expediency

00:41:26.851 --> 00:41:30.869
that you get better information
out from torture."

00:41:30.869 --> 00:41:36.831
Well I think I'll probably
leave it here and then we'll

00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:39.260
continue it Tuesday.
 

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:43.559
And I hope it got you up in
speed--

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:48.268
utilitarianism and John Stuart
Mill,

00:41:48.268 --> 00:41:52.911
and Adam Smith,
and you see how actually John

00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:58.711
Stuart Mill and utilitarianism
radicalizes one stream of

00:41:58.711 --> 00:42:04.719
thought which is in Adam Smith,
but Adam Smith is not quite

00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:07.750
ready to go as far as Bentham
went,

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.909
and even not as far as John
Stuart Mill went.

00:42:12.909 --> 00:42:14.530
Okay.
 

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:20.000

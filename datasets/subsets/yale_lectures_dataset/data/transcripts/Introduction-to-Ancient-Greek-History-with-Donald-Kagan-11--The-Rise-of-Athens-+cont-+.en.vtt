00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.984
Professor Donald
Kagan: I think the last

00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:06.673
thing I mentioned to you was the
attempted coup

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:10.460
d'Ã©tat on the part of
a nobleman by the name of Cylon,

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.358
who was attempting to establish
a tyranny of the sort that was

00:00:15.358 --> 00:00:18.410
becoming common in the
neighborhood,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.610
and that he was the son-in-law
of a tyrant in next-door Megara.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.990
The coup failed,
but the problems that we

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.810
imagine produced the coup did
not go away,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.406
and once these evidence of
continuing pressure for change

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:44.510
away from the traditional
aristocratic republic,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.263
which the early polis
was, towards something that

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:54.017
would challenge the unquestioned
traditional rule of the

00:00:54.017 --> 00:00:56.889
aristocracy.
Again, these are all

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:01.060
traditional dates and shouldn't
be taken too seriously as

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.066
precise,
but probably reflect a pretty

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.780
decent chronology in a general
way.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.436
So, in the traditional year of
621 we hear that Athens received

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:20.704
its first written law code,
famous as the Code of Draco or

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:25.689
in Greek it would be
Dracon.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.436
Reports that we have of it
indicate that one kind of law

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:36.890
that was included in the code
was concerning homicide,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.090
which has a special place in
Greek thinking.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.467
Probably it's true of most
primitive societies that

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:50.340
homicide involves religious
ideas.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.929
The Greeks believed that the
killing of men was accepted in

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.132
wartime, was a religious
pollution that had to be taken

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:06.021
care of one way or another.
Beyond that there was also the

00:02:06.021 --> 00:02:09.379
primitive thing that was not
particularly religious,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.924
but reflected primitive
thinking that all homicides need

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:17.147
to be avenged,
and so the blood feud was

00:02:17.147 --> 00:02:22.023
clearly part of the way to deal
with homicide in early Greek

00:02:22.023 --> 00:02:25.321
history.
As is true of most early

00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:30.050
societies there comes a time
that no longer will do,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.828
that there's a sufficient
civilization,

00:02:32.828 --> 00:02:35.825
urbanization,
whatever it is that made the

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:38.743
change,
that people feel this has got

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:40.584
to stop.
One reason it does is,

00:02:40.584 --> 00:02:43.116
of course, because it tears the
community apart,

00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:46.240
and as you are in the business
of building a community,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.209
which is what's happening here
in the polis,

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.388
you can't have that going on.
One reason it is the way to

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:56.933
settle things is,
because there isn't any proper

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:00.009
government.
There are only these noblemen.

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:04.386
There is a council to be sure,
but it's all a question of

00:03:04.386 --> 00:03:08.138
going to somebody,
who has power and has respect,

00:03:08.138 --> 00:03:11.030
and getting a judgment from
them.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.598
But as time passes,
that's not good enough,

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:17.206
and as the community becomes
something that is more and more

00:03:17.206 --> 00:03:21.020
unified,
there is a search for a better

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.770
outcome and that is what
resulted in the Code of Draco.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.223
Just the fact that there is
written code,

00:03:30.223 --> 00:03:34.539
so that it is now available to
anybody who read,

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.262
which is not to say lots of
people, but even so people who

00:03:38.262 --> 00:03:41.069
can read can now tell it to
other people.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.903
That very fact is the sign of
the decline of the power of the

00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:48.928
aristocracy, because they alone
used to know what the law was or

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:51.982
claim to know it,
and people would go to them and

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.745
say what's the law,
and they could administer it as

00:03:54.745 --> 00:03:57.578
they saw fit,
which gave them extraordinary

00:03:57.578 --> 00:04:01.337
power, not to say prestige.
Now, when it is possible,

00:04:01.337 --> 00:04:05.767
at least in some realms of the
law, to know what that law is

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:10.198
that has reduced the special
place that the aristocrats have

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:11.400
in society.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.389
Stories are told about the
Code of Draco;

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.700
like most early law codes,
and we can compare the Draconic

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.519
Code with a famous or less
famous ones,

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:30.432
much older, that we find
especially in Mesopotamia in the

00:04:30.432 --> 00:04:33.565
Ancient Near East.
The most famous of these

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:38.120
because it has been inscribed on
a remarkable piece of sculpture

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.940
which is now in the Louvre in
Paris,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.523
the Code of Hammurabi from the
second millennium B.C.,

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:49.069
is really quite similar in its
essence.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.502
It says, if so and so does such
a thing, this is what the

00:04:55.502 --> 00:04:59.976
punishment is.
From our point of view,

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:06.167
early codes like Draco are
notorious for how harsh they

00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:09.330
are.
The Greeks later on said that

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.890
the Code of Draco was written
not in ink, but in blood.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.070
In fact, what it does is to
codify what had been the

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.579
ordinary practice.
Nobody was inventing laws;

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.980
they were writing down what had
been the customary procedures.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.407
And again, a characteristic for
such developments is that over

00:05:33.407 --> 00:05:37.907
time when people know how harsh
these things are and as society

00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:42.553
sort of calms down from the more
wild condition that it was in at

00:05:42.553 --> 00:05:47.008
an earlier time,
it tends to reduce the severity

00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:51.158
of the penalties and to
legislate, however the

00:05:51.158 --> 00:05:57.019
legislation goes forward,
in a more gentle way.

00:05:57.019 --> 00:06:00.374
So, that's another development
which is obviously the

00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:04.179
consequence--aristocrats don't
give up their power willingly

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:06.759
out of the goodness of their
hearts.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:14.682
There's pressure out there for
access to the legal process for

00:06:14.682 --> 00:06:18.801
the ordinary person,
and again I think,

00:06:18.801 --> 00:06:23.144
it's easy to believe that a lot
of that pressure is coming from

00:06:23.144 --> 00:06:27.348
that hoplite farmer class that
is becoming more important and

00:06:27.348 --> 00:06:32.165
more demanding all the time.
Another change in the old

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.793
placid life of the early
Athenian republic,

00:06:35.793 --> 00:06:39.814
as we imagine it to be,
is the conquest by the

00:06:39.814 --> 00:06:44.492
Athenians of the Island of
Salamis that lies in the Saronic

00:06:44.492 --> 00:06:49.009
Gulf to the west of Attica
between Attica and Megara.

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:54.776
Athens and Megara will contest
the control of Salamis for some

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:58.180
time and fight each other over
it,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.903
and on this occasion sometime
here in the seventh century,

00:07:01.903 --> 00:07:05.170
probably towards the end of the
seventh century,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:11.079
Athens conquers Salamis and
populates it with Athenians.

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:16.459
It's not really a colony in the
sense that these apoichia

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:20.472
I described for you are;
it simply becomes part of

00:07:20.472 --> 00:07:23.769
Attica, as do all the
subdivisions in Attica.

00:07:23.769 --> 00:07:27.335
But it's the first occasion
that we see of the physical

00:07:27.335 --> 00:07:31.099
expansion of the Athenian
polis which is indicative

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:35.589
of the kind of stuff we've been
talking about elsewhere as well,

00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:38.984
and yet another sign takes
place about the same time,

00:07:38.984 --> 00:07:41.726
end of the seventh,
very early in the sixth

00:07:41.726 --> 00:07:44.891
century.
The establishment of the

00:07:44.891 --> 00:07:49.568
first overseas colony by the
Athenians at a place called

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:54.141
Sigeum across the Aegean Sea,
just at the entrance to the

00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:58.050
Dardanelles, the Hellespont and
that is not an accident,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.005
I think, because that root,
through the Hellespont,

00:08:02.005 --> 00:08:06.610
through the Sea of Marmara,
through the Bosphorus and into

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.537
the Black Sea,
will, as Athens develops

00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:13.759
economically,
become the most critical trade

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:18.723
route for Athens indeed.
After a while when Athens has

00:08:18.723 --> 00:08:23.756
developed a mixed economy and as
population grows it becomes

00:08:23.756 --> 00:08:28.789
dependent on that route for
supplying it with the grain that

00:08:28.789 --> 00:08:33.139
it needs as the staple of life
for its people.

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:37.925
So, this is the first little
step towards a very important

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:41.200
development for Athens in the
future.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.573
I guess the reasons for it,
late and less pressing than in

00:08:45.573 --> 00:08:48.800
the other places,
but they must be the same to

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.977
some considerable degree.
Hunger for land which means

00:08:52.977 --> 00:08:56.473
that there is a growing
population, that needs

00:08:56.473 --> 00:09:00.980
additional land and also because
of the location of it,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.039
it's inescapable I think that
they were also thinking that

00:09:05.039 --> 00:09:08.600
early of commercial
considerations and it turns out

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.730
that there were very great
commercial opportunities in that

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.139
direction.
So, we've seen a number of

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:21.376
signs of change moving Athens in
the direction that the other

00:09:21.376 --> 00:09:25.843
Greek states were moving,
which bring us in the early

00:09:25.843 --> 00:09:30.041
sixth century to the first,
I think I've said this before

00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:34.613
but I want to say it again,
to the first truly living,

00:09:34.613 --> 00:09:39.527
human being that we come across
probably in all of Greek

00:09:39.527 --> 00:09:42.585
history,
certainly in that of Athens,

00:09:42.585 --> 00:09:47.106
Solon, whom we think of as the
great lawgiver for reasons that

00:09:47.106 --> 00:09:51.850
you've read about and I'll tell
you about in a moment anyway.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:55.340
The reason he is so
much--we can speak of him as a

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.292
human being is because he wrote
those poems from which I read

00:09:59.292 --> 00:10:03.441
you some excerpts the other day
and that poem tells us something

00:10:03.441 --> 00:10:06.799
about him and about the world in
which lived.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:08.805
And, of course,
we have many,

00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:12.171
many stories about him,
because he was very well

00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:16.110
remembered as a critical
individual in the history,

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.379
not only of Athens,
but in Greece.

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:23.371
The Greeks later put together a
list of the seven sages,

00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:28.453
seven wise men of the archaic
period in Greek history and

00:10:28.453 --> 00:10:33.604
Solon is one of the seven sages.
Indeed, one of the problems

00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:37.512
about knowing the truth about
what Solon did is that it's

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:41.351
pretty clear that lots of
stories that had nothing to do

00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:45.049
with Solon were attached to
Solon in later ages,

00:10:45.049 --> 00:10:48.218
because he was the prominent
figure that everybody had heard

00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:52.277
about and knew something about,
and so it isn't easy to know,

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:56.380
if somebody says Solon did this
or Solon said that,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.360
whether he really did.
We can only try to sort of

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:05.759
figure it out as best we can,
but that's a special problem we

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:10.121
have about him.
Now, what becomes apparent,

00:11:10.121 --> 00:11:15.162
as soon as we examine the
things that brought Solon to the

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:18.442
fore,
is that Athens is clearly

00:11:18.442 --> 00:11:23.896
suffering a very serious
internal problem as we get to

00:11:23.896 --> 00:11:28.458
these years.
By the way, the traditional

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:34.943
date for Solon's appointment as
sole archon in these

00:11:34.943 --> 00:11:39.054
years is 594 B.C.
Again, we don't have to take

00:11:39.054 --> 00:11:43.138
that literally but it tells you
we're really talking about the

00:11:43.138 --> 00:11:45.750
very beginning of the sixth
century.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.924
Here's the picture as it is
depicted by Solon himself in his

00:11:50.924 --> 00:11:55.747
poems, but also in the work of
Herodotus and other later

00:11:55.747 --> 00:12:00.397
writers.
The crisis in its most acute

00:12:00.397 --> 00:12:06.308
form takes the shape of
Athenians who have been

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:10.141
enslaved.
Some of them have not only been

00:12:10.141 --> 00:12:14.501
enslaved and live in Attica as
slaves, but some of them have

00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:18.561
been sold abroad,
and Solon tells us that some of

00:12:18.561 --> 00:12:23.640
them have been abroad so long
they have forgotten the Athenian

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.493
language.
So that we have to have a

00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:30.570
picture in which this problem is
one of some duration.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.516
We have to imagine it's at
least a couple of generations

00:12:34.516 --> 00:12:37.529
old in order for that to make
any sense.

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:43.620
But it reaches its peak around
the time I'm talking about.

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.179
And it's this that--how did
they get to be slaves?

00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:49.850
This is not a case where
people have always been slaves.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:53.823
These are not people who were
brought from somewhere else as

00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:56.405
slaves.
These are not people who were

00:12:56.405 --> 00:12:59.470
conquered and made slaves by the
conquerors.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:04.540
These are Athenian citizens who
used to be free and have become

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.283
slaves, and the answer to how
they became slaves is through

00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:12.435
debt.
People were borrowing money and

00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:16.722
obviously failing to pay it
back, and at a certain point

00:13:16.722 --> 00:13:21.086
they couldn't borrow money on
the basis of something they

00:13:21.086 --> 00:13:24.360
could offer as a surety for the
loan.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:27.080
If they had land,
it would have been gone by now.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.802
If they had movable products or
movable possessions that would

00:13:30.802 --> 00:13:33.973
have been gone.
All they had left to give was

00:13:33.973 --> 00:13:37.650
the person and probably,
I hate to tell you this my

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.994
friends,
but reality is reality,

00:13:39.994 --> 00:13:43.930
probably the first thing they
did was to give their children

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.799
as a surety for the loan and
when the loan was not met,

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:51.466
the children became slaves of
the person who had leant them

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:55.820
money and at some point,
probably this even happened to

00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.338
grownups themselves,
so that a sufficient number of

00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:05.218
people had been so enslaved as
to create a very general

00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:10.730
problem.The story is that
apart from direct slavery,

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:16.429
there was another form of
farming by very poor people that

00:14:16.429 --> 00:14:21.427
led to terrific misery.
The term that the Greeks used

00:14:21.427 --> 00:14:24.355
for this was the
hektemoroi,

00:14:24.355 --> 00:14:29.177
which means one sixth men,
and scholars have argued about

00:14:29.177 --> 00:14:33.832
what does this mean.
These were people who had been

00:14:33.832 --> 00:14:38.837
so far into debt that they were
essentially sharecroppers and

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:43.842
the question is did they keep
one sixth or did they keep five

00:14:43.842 --> 00:14:46.026
sixth?
I think anybody who knows

00:14:46.026 --> 00:14:49.118
anything about what's possible
on a farm like this realizes it

00:14:49.118 --> 00:14:52.260
couldn't have been more than one
sixth that they gave away,

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.028
because they didn't make enough.
They wouldn't have been able to

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:56.851
stay alive.
But in any case,

00:14:56.851 --> 00:15:00.935
these one sixth men were
fundamentally sharecroppers

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:05.899
under the control of the people
to whom they owed the debt.

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:11.613
Another aspect of this
thing was that the lands that

00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:17.638
were mortgaged in effect were
shown by a stone that had the

00:15:17.638 --> 00:15:23.039
mortgage inscribed on it and
placed on the soil.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:27.634
They were called horoi
and so seeing the horoi

00:15:27.634 --> 00:15:32.229
scattered all over the fields
were indicative of the pitiful

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:37.989
lot of the poor farmers,
who had fallen into debt during

00:15:37.989 --> 00:15:41.583
this period.
Well, scholars have also had a

00:15:41.583 --> 00:15:45.559
fantastic time trying to figure
out how this came about,

00:15:45.559 --> 00:15:48.994
and I never found anything that
seems satisfactory to me,

00:15:48.994 --> 00:15:52.060
based on looking at the sources
or reading people's

00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:54.820
interpretations until once again
my hero,

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:59.210
Victor Hanson,
came down the road and he's a

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.559
farmer.
It's amazing how much that

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:04.914
helps them understand farmers
and I like his interpretation of

00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:07.969
how things got that way,
so let me give you a quick

00:16:07.969 --> 00:16:12.059
rundown of how that worked.
Remember these times are

00:16:12.059 --> 00:16:16.000
times fundamentally of growth of
farming skill,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.062
growth of farming return.
People are making a living on

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.386
areas, farmland that they could
never have made a living on

00:16:23.386 --> 00:16:25.475
before,
because they've learned how to

00:16:25.475 --> 00:16:28.355
grow the olives and grow vines
and make olive oil and make

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:31.640
wine,
and they have reclaimed land,

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:37.499
which had not been useful for
farming in the past and that's

00:16:37.499 --> 00:16:43.159
how they got into trouble,
because for one thing farmers

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:45.895
don't all succeed.
In any society,

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:49.619
there are farmers who try to be
good farmers and fail and they

00:16:49.619 --> 00:16:52.549
fail sometimes through their own
shortcoming,

00:16:52.549 --> 00:16:55.659
and they fail sometimes because
nature is not kind to them;

00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:59.230
luck is always part of the game
in farming.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.935
But what happens is that they
get into trouble because things

00:17:03.935 --> 00:17:06.319
don't go well.
They start out;

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.180
they have a crop,
and the crop doesn't do well.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.773
So, they need money for next
year, both to make it through

00:17:12.773 --> 00:17:16.430
the winter and also to have seed
for the following year.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.315
So, what they do is they have
to borrow that money,

00:17:19.315 --> 00:17:22.201
and if the next crop is bad
too, well there you go,

00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:25.029
and you can see the whole
process unraveling.

00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:28.960
I think that's probably the way
it came about.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.478
According to Hanson,
the majority of the farmers

00:17:33.478 --> 00:17:38.130
were not so affected.
They were doing okay.

00:17:38.130 --> 00:17:42.374
It was the losers who were the
ones who were suffering these

00:17:42.374 --> 00:17:46.691
things, but there were enough
losers, so that this was a very

00:17:46.691 --> 00:17:50.647
serious problem.
Now, this rejects other earlier

00:17:50.647 --> 00:17:54.707
theories, for instance,
that the soil of Attica had

00:17:54.707 --> 00:17:58.930
become exhausted through over
cropping and so on.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.428
If Hanson is right,
this is less likely to be true

00:18:01.428 --> 00:18:04.079
than it used to be because
there's more diversity,

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:09.940
diversification of farming than
there had been in the past.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.658
Another theory is that a
cause of the problem was

00:18:14.658 --> 00:18:18.519
deforestation.
Well, it's perfectly true that

00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:23.579
Athens was severely deforested
in the course of the centuries,

00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:27.889
so that Plato could comment on
how this deforesting had denuded

00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:30.670
Athens of trees by the fourth
century,

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.009
but there's no reason to think
that that was happening,

00:18:34.009 --> 00:18:36.359
especially during the time of
Solon.

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:39.480
Very probably that
deforestation hadn't gone that

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.924
far, and in any case its
connection to problems of the

00:18:42.924 --> 00:18:45.980
farmland are less clear than
they might be.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.509
Here's what Hanson finally
concludes about it.

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:55.253
He says the crisis was a
natural, evolutionary process of

00:18:55.253 --> 00:18:59.832
success and failure.
A subtle transformation that

00:18:59.832 --> 00:19:04.145
occurs when there are
fundamental changes in land use

00:19:04.145 --> 00:19:09.038
and a growing population and
that seems to me to be the most

00:19:09.038 --> 00:19:14.430
satisfactory account of how the
Athenians got into that fix.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:17.929
But in that fix they were,
there's no question about it,

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:20.420
so the question was,
what is to be done?

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:23.480
Now, the pressure to do
something about it,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.406
I think is twofold.
Of course, inherently,

00:19:26.406 --> 00:19:29.517
Athenians would have been
bothered by all of this,

00:19:29.517 --> 00:19:33.200
even those who were not the
ones who did the suffering.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.102
But it's amazing how we all are
able to bear the suffering of

00:19:37.102 --> 00:19:39.900
our neighbor,
if we're not suffering too.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.113
However, the second element I
think that put pressure on

00:19:44.113 --> 00:19:48.557
everybody, was next door in
Megara when things had gone bad

00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:51.868
for the poor,
there was a revolution and a

00:19:51.868 --> 00:19:55.741
tyranny was established,
and so it was down the road in

00:19:55.741 --> 00:19:58.242
Corinth,
and so it was a little further

00:19:58.242 --> 00:20:01.440
down the road in Scythian,
so that the dominant people,

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.978
the satisfied people,
the people who liked things as

00:20:04.978 --> 00:20:08.881
they were, were worried that,
if they didn't solve their

00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:12.115
socio-economic problem they
would find themselves

00:20:12.115 --> 00:20:16.042
confronting a tyranny.
After all, that's what Cylon

00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:20.287
had in mind back thirty,
thirty-five years ago and the

00:20:20.287 --> 00:20:23.651
danger was ever present,
and I think that is what you

00:20:23.651 --> 00:20:27.662
need to have in your mind.
The threat of tyranny was

00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:33.171
the great element that made
chances or attempts at reform

00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:38.581
necessary and allowed the
Athenians to give things a try

00:20:38.581 --> 00:20:43.500
that they would never have
thought of before.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:49.803
So, what they finally decided
to do was to select from among

00:20:49.803 --> 00:20:55.573
themselves, one Athenian who
would replace all the nine

00:20:55.573 --> 00:21:01.343
archons of the usual
government of Athens and be

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:07.220
given the job of sole
archon for one year,

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.878
and he would be allowed to
legislate for the Athenians as a

00:21:11.878 --> 00:21:14.930
way out of the trouble they were
in.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.139
Now, think of how desperate
things must be,

00:21:18.139 --> 00:21:22.113
and one aspect of that
desperation I think we have to

00:21:22.113 --> 00:21:25.530
believe,
is that there was no way they

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:30.359
could have put together a
coalition of citizens who would

00:21:30.359 --> 00:21:37.732
been sufficiently unified,
sufficiently public-spirited to

00:21:37.732 --> 00:21:43.706
trust with such an activity.
We have to believe there

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:46.336
was sufficient differences of
interest on the part of

00:21:46.336 --> 00:21:49.017
different elements in the
society that would have made

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:51.545
that impossible,
otherwise you don't do this

00:21:51.545 --> 00:21:54.535
kind of thing.
It is worth pointing out that

00:21:54.535 --> 00:21:58.734
something like Solon's sole
archonship is heard of

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:02.859
about the same time in Greek
history in other towns.

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:05.771
Sometimes they appointed
somebody they called an

00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:09.115
Aesymnetes, somebody who was
supposed to be the guy who

00:22:09.115 --> 00:22:12.573
settled things for them.
So, it's an idea that came

00:22:12.573 --> 00:22:15.820
obviously naturally to the
Greeks, but we ought to

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:19.400
recognize what an extraordinary
thing it really is.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.380
They chose Solon.
Why did they choose Solon?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.728
He obviously was reputed to
have the kinds of

00:22:27.728 --> 00:22:31.609
characteristics which would make
him a competent,

00:22:31.609 --> 00:22:35.531
intelligent,
wise, fair person to do this

00:22:35.531 --> 00:22:39.255
kind of thing.
He had achieved fame,

00:22:39.255 --> 00:22:42.950
notoriety by his military
activity.

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:47.817
He had led in the war against
the Megarians and had fought

00:22:47.817 --> 00:22:52.941
very well and it was out of that
military achievement that he

00:22:52.941 --> 00:22:56.202
became well known,
and then his other

00:22:56.202 --> 00:22:59.890
characteristics obviously were
also well known.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.267
If you read his poems,
you realize he was a man who

00:23:04.267 --> 00:23:09.132
knew how to express himself and
to persuade others of what he

00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:13.104
had in mind and that his
approach was one that was

00:23:13.104 --> 00:23:15.432
popular.
We should keep in mind what's

00:23:15.432 --> 00:23:16.762
going on here.
First of all,

00:23:16.762 --> 00:23:20.050
we are told he was a man--we
have contradictory stories and I

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.009
think I can understand how the
contradiction arose.

00:23:23.009 --> 00:23:28.717
One story says he was a
nobleman coming from extremely

00:23:28.717 --> 00:23:33.878
famous important ancestors.
The other speaks of him as a

00:23:33.878 --> 00:23:37.663
man of the middle rank,
which doesn't really work out

00:23:37.663 --> 00:23:40.178
with that.
I think the best explanation I

00:23:40.178 --> 00:23:42.792
can come up with that,
is that he undoubtedly was a

00:23:42.792 --> 00:23:45.969
person of noble birth.
In that kind of society,

00:23:45.969 --> 00:23:50.565
only such a person was likely
to be looked to for a position

00:23:50.565 --> 00:23:53.372
of leadership.
But I think what may have

00:23:53.372 --> 00:23:56.220
persuaded folks--well,
he also couldn't have been

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.186
fabulously wealthy,
but certainly he was not a poor

00:23:59.186 --> 00:24:01.576
man.
But I think what convinced

00:24:01.576 --> 00:24:05.932
people that he was of the middle
rank was that his message and

00:24:05.932 --> 00:24:09.359
the propaganda that he sent out
in his poems,

00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:13.150
and indeed, the character of
the reforms that he proposed

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:14.910
were very much moderate.

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:23.872
That's the word that came
to be the one so much admired,

00:24:23.872 --> 00:24:28.380
and favored,
and sought by the Greek people.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:33.287
Keep in mind this is the period
in Greek history when the

00:24:33.287 --> 00:24:38.545
Delphic Oracle has come to the
height of its influence in the

00:24:38.545 --> 00:24:43.190
Greek world and in the
surrounding world as well.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:49.052
The Oracle of Apollo at Delphi
was the most famous place that

00:24:49.052 --> 00:24:53.450
was putting forward the idea of
moderation.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.772
The Greek word is
sophrosyne,

00:24:56.772 --> 00:25:01.608
self control and moderation.
You remember the messages at

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:05.018
the Delphic Oracle,
"know thyself," meaning don't

00:25:05.018 --> 00:25:07.859
imagine that you are more than a
man,

00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:13.069
but that you are merely a man
and don't do anything in excess.

00:25:13.069 --> 00:25:14.650
Moderation is what should be
sought.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.888
Greeks never stopped
worshipping at the shrine of

00:25:17.888 --> 00:25:20.789
moderation for the rest of their
history.

00:25:20.789 --> 00:25:25.665
A cynical man says the Greeks
were so in love with moderation,

00:25:25.665 --> 00:25:30.061
because it was so rare among
them, but I think it's rare

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:34.546
among all of us.
So, here was Solon who was the

00:25:34.546 --> 00:25:39.934
spokesman of that very powerful
mode of thinking that was

00:25:39.934 --> 00:25:43.880
pervading the Greek world at the
time,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.384
and no doubt he gave it a great
step forward with the things

00:25:47.384 --> 00:25:49.880
that he did and the things that
he said.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.690
Okay, let's look at a few
of the things that he did.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.519
I'm picking out things that I'm
pretty sure really were

00:25:56.519 --> 00:25:58.532
Solonian;
there were others that are

00:25:58.532 --> 00:26:00.569
attributed to him that are more
debatable.

00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:03.621
But the most basic problem is
what are we going to do with

00:26:03.621 --> 00:26:06.029
these people who are losing
their property,

00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:08.993
have lost their property,
have lost their freedom,

00:26:08.993 --> 00:26:12.561
what's to be done about that
agricultural problem we've been

00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:16.064
talking about?
So, Solon introduced the

00:26:16.064 --> 00:26:22.000
measure which is called in
Greek, the seisachtheia.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.278
Fortunately,
you have it on your computers

00:26:24.278 --> 00:26:27.279
and you've all copied it down
and taken it to class.

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:28.500
So, you can study these things,
right?

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:39.424
That measure abolished all
debts that were based on the

00:26:39.424 --> 00:26:45.019
body of the person,
that is, the surety given was

00:26:45.019 --> 00:26:51.321
the body of the borrower.
Any debt that was so incurred

00:26:51.321 --> 00:26:53.940
was abolished,
cancelled.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.829
On the other hand,
there was no general

00:26:56.829 --> 00:26:59.689
cancellation of debts.
In other words,

00:26:59.689 --> 00:27:03.801
any normal debt that didn't
have that characteristic

00:27:03.801 --> 00:27:06.569
continued.
Another thing that the poor and

00:27:06.569 --> 00:27:09.786
the unhappy would have liked,
they would have liked general

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:12.392
cancellation of the debt.
I should point out,

00:27:12.392 --> 00:27:15.607
whenever you have lower class
discontent in the Greek world

00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:18.599
there are two things that they
typically asked for.

00:27:18.599 --> 00:27:22.618
One is abolition of debt,
because they're always in debt

00:27:22.618 --> 00:27:26.490
and the second thing is
redistribution of the land.

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:30.299
Now, redistribution of the land
means civil war.

00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:34.089
Nobody is going to allow his
land to be taken away from him

00:27:34.089 --> 00:27:37.029
and given to somebody else
without a fight,

00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:40.592
and so if you go for that,
what you're going to have to do

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:43.029
is to have armed force to
achieve it.

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:46.467
And you're going to end up with
a tyranny, because that's the

00:27:46.467 --> 00:27:49.160
kind of things tyrants are more
likely to do.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:56.633
So, he avoided that and he
did not permit redistribution of

00:27:56.633 --> 00:27:59.441
the land.
If you just look at that land

00:27:59.441 --> 00:28:02.200
question for a moment,
and the dead bondage question,

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:08.179
you can see that it is indeed
the moderate position in between

00:28:08.179 --> 00:28:11.671
the view of those,
the poor, the slave,

00:28:11.671 --> 00:28:15.118
the indebted who wanted these
radical changes,

00:28:15.118 --> 00:28:19.485
and the old aristocracy would
have preferred to just leave

00:28:19.485 --> 00:28:23.056
things as they were.
Instead, Solon came through

00:28:23.056 --> 00:28:26.615
with this middling program,
and by the way apparently there

00:28:26.615 --> 00:28:29.069
was--we don't know how this was
done,

00:28:29.069 --> 00:28:32.948
but apparently they brought
back Athenians who had been

00:28:32.948 --> 00:28:36.635
enslaved abroad also.
So, there must have been some

00:28:36.635 --> 00:28:39.428
expenditure of funds;
somehow they must have

00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:42.153
collected it from somebody and
brought them back,

00:28:42.153 --> 00:28:45.388
but the most important thing is
what's done right there in

00:28:45.388 --> 00:28:46.070
Attica.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:54.634
What all of this does is to
settle down the situation for

00:28:54.634 --> 00:28:59.943
the moment, but it does not
guarantee that these very same

00:28:59.943 --> 00:29:05.158
problems that produced the
difficulty we're talking about

00:29:05.158 --> 00:29:08.789
would not reappear in the
future.

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:11.070
I think if we looked at
this measure,

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.433
it's already a clue to most
everything that's characteristic

00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:17.627
of the Solonian reforms.
They are moderate,

00:29:17.627 --> 00:29:20.380
and therefore,
unsatisfactory.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.696
That is, they don't solve the
problems that are there,

00:29:23.696 --> 00:29:26.950
but that doesn't mean they are
not worth anything.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.586
For one thing they ameliorate
the problem and therefore they

00:29:30.586 --> 00:29:34.347
ameliorate the discontent and
the danger to the freedom of the

00:29:34.347 --> 00:29:38.485
Athenians,
but they also sometimes set the

00:29:38.485 --> 00:29:43.980
stage for the elimination of the
problem over time,

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.814
because ways are found,
obviously, for people to manage

00:29:47.814 --> 00:29:51.028
these things.
If the possibility of debt

00:29:51.028 --> 00:29:55.242
slavery is taken away,
other forms of managing these

00:29:55.242 --> 00:29:59.218
things will assert themselves.
Indeed, what we find,

00:29:59.218 --> 00:30:02.666
and I must say what I'm going
to tell you doesn't solve the

00:30:02.666 --> 00:30:05.212
mystery,
but what we find as you get to

00:30:05.212 --> 00:30:08.430
the fifth century,
the Classical Period in Athens,

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:12.402
is an extraordinary situation,
because it's so good and so

00:30:12.402 --> 00:30:17.006
unusual.
This is that most Athenian

00:30:17.006 --> 00:30:24.670
farmers in the fifth century
seemed to have small,

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.543
but adequate family farms that
allow many, many,

00:30:28.543 --> 00:30:32.829
many Athenians to live in a
very satisfactory way,

00:30:32.829 --> 00:30:36.079
given the expectations that
they had.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:40.504
It never abolished great
bit land holding arrangements

00:30:40.504 --> 00:30:43.405
that some people had.
There always were,

00:30:43.405 --> 00:30:47.064
through Athenian history no
matter how thoroughly democratic

00:30:47.064 --> 00:30:49.611
a state became,
there always were great

00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:53.096
difference of wealth between
very wealthy people and very

00:30:53.096 --> 00:30:55.945
poor people.
But what is extraordinary and

00:30:55.945 --> 00:30:59.247
what would have been very
satisfactory to the Greek

00:30:59.247 --> 00:31:02.155
political thinkers,
even Aristotle,

00:31:02.155 --> 00:31:05.552
for instance,
in the fourth century,

00:31:05.552 --> 00:31:11.569
there was a great middle ground
in which the people were pretty

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:16.809
much like each other in their
economic condition,

00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:20.717
which produces the greatest
stability, the greatest

00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:24.077
satisfaction,
the greatest capacity for self

00:31:24.077 --> 00:31:27.114
government.
So, that was one of the

00:31:27.114 --> 00:31:30.438
consequences,
although it didn't happen as

00:31:30.438 --> 00:31:35.117
any direct action by Solon.
We are also told by

00:31:35.117 --> 00:31:40.686
Aristotle and other ancient
sources that Solon changed the

00:31:40.686 --> 00:31:46.647
coin standard for Athens from
one that was used in the west in

00:31:46.647 --> 00:31:50.359
the Peloponnesus and in the
west,

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:52.579
to one that was used in the
east.

00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:56.579
He changed the weight from the
Pheidonian measures,

00:31:56.579 --> 00:32:00.696
Pheidonian coin standard,
to the Euboic standard,

00:32:00.696 --> 00:32:05.799
which people try to understand
why and how that would work.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:10.227
It would have made trade with
Aegean and the east better,

00:32:10.227 --> 00:32:14.181
and of course we know that
that's the area that the

00:32:14.181 --> 00:32:17.660
Athenians are exploiting
vigorously now.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.490
Although we must recognize that
when the Athenians get rolling

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.631
in the trade business,
they do tremendously well in

00:32:24.631 --> 00:32:27.422
the west as well.
But there's a bigger problem

00:32:27.422 --> 00:32:30.000
with the story about these coins
than any other.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.767
As you know from what I told
you before, the almost universal

00:32:33.767 --> 00:32:37.220
opinion of coin experts is,
how could he change the coin

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.170
standards?
There weren't any coins yet.

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.490
Now, you're either going to
believe them or you're going to

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:45.359
believe Aristotle;
you know where I am.

00:32:45.359 --> 00:32:53.088
Okay, in other steps that
turned out to be very important

00:32:53.088 --> 00:32:58.756
in the long run,
he encouraged the use of the

00:32:58.756 --> 00:33:05.712
land for the purpose of
producing cash crops like olive

00:33:05.712 --> 00:33:10.155
oil and wine,
and the Athenians do use more

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:13.664
and more of their soil,
largely because there's more

00:33:13.664 --> 00:33:17.930
and more of their soil that can
grow that and nothing else.

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:21.429
But as they do,
the consequence is to make the

00:33:21.429 --> 00:33:25.939
agricultural output of Athens
much more diversified than it

00:33:25.939 --> 00:33:28.788
had been,
which saves you--the more

00:33:28.788 --> 00:33:32.393
diverse your crops,
the less chance you have to be

00:33:32.393 --> 00:33:35.630
wiped out in any one year by bad
results,

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.932
and as a matter of fact,
over time it became a very

00:33:39.932 --> 00:33:44.750
satisfactory device and helps
explain again the health of

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:49.827
Athenian agriculture when we see
it in the fifth century and

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:52.325
later.
Another thing that he

00:33:52.325 --> 00:33:55.549
did--I'm going to talk about
citizenship for a moment;

00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:59.345
the Greek poleis were
very jealous of their

00:33:59.345 --> 00:34:02.121
citizenship.
Their theory of the

00:34:02.121 --> 00:34:07.196
polis was that all
citizens were the descendants of

00:34:07.196 --> 00:34:10.489
the original founders of the
city.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:14.971
In other words,
everybody in Athens was a

00:34:14.971 --> 00:34:18.699
relative of some kind.
Of course it wasn't true;

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.497
certainly in Athens we know
there were many immigrants and

00:34:21.497 --> 00:34:23.841
so on.
But the fact remains that that

00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:27.744
was the normal thinking about
it, and the notion of this--the

00:34:27.744 --> 00:34:30.210
power,
the centrality of the concept

00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:34.099
of polis to them is
something we need to understand,

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:37.199
and they were jealous of it and
selfish with it.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.611
This was not something they
would simply allow people to

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:44.926
acquire, if they wanted it.
This place is us and it's not

00:34:44.926 --> 00:34:49.350
them and we don't make people
citizens, and that was

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:53.191
essentially the thing.
To be a citizen of Athens in

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:56.533
those days, you had to have a
father who was a citizen of

00:34:56.533 --> 00:34:59.150
Athens;
nothing else would do the trick.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:04.767
But Solon changed that;
Solon offered citizenship to

00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:12.117
individuals who came to Athens
to settle and could show that

00:35:12.117 --> 00:35:18.280
they had a valuable skill,
a valuable craft and the

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:24.763
results were that Athens would
become in the decades following

00:35:24.763 --> 00:35:27.428
Solon,
a great center for the

00:35:27.428 --> 00:35:30.380
manufacturing of a variety of
things;

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.554
pottery is what we have,
and great painted pottery is a

00:35:34.554 --> 00:35:37.570
great part of the Athenian
tradition,

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:41.737
but sculpture also and all
kinds of things that we probably

00:35:41.737 --> 00:35:46.119
don't have, because they would
have been destroyed by time.

00:35:46.119 --> 00:35:48.405
But the idea was,
if you were a skilled

00:35:48.405 --> 00:35:52.014
craftsman, you could come to
Athens and you would not have to

00:35:52.014 --> 00:35:56.351
be what you would otherwise be.
Anybody who came to Athens,

00:35:56.351 --> 00:36:00.981
not under these rules could
stay, could make themselves a

00:36:00.981 --> 00:36:05.209
permanent resident,
but he would always be what the

00:36:05.209 --> 00:36:07.696
Greeks called a
metoikois,

00:36:07.696 --> 00:36:11.897
we say in English a metic,
meaning a resident alien,

00:36:11.897 --> 00:36:15.677
never to be a citizen.
Only citizens were

00:36:15.677 --> 00:36:21.346
permitted to own land in Attica.
Only citizens had access to the

00:36:21.346 --> 00:36:24.791
Athenian courts;
a non-citizen who had to go to

00:36:24.791 --> 00:36:28.865
court for one reason or another
would have to find a citizen to

00:36:28.865 --> 00:36:32.216
be his spokesman.
So, you really were cut off

00:36:32.216 --> 00:36:35.836
from some very--of course a
non-citizen could not

00:36:35.836 --> 00:36:39.909
participate in the political
life of Athens either.

00:36:39.909 --> 00:36:42.471
But these people were not going
to be metics,

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:45.440
because of the economic skills
that they brought.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.675
Solon arranged for them to
become Athenian citizens,

00:36:49.675 --> 00:36:52.844
very rare thing.
We will have a couple of other

00:36:52.844 --> 00:36:55.970
occasions in this course and
take a look in a moment when

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:58.928
foreigners were permitted to
come to Athens and become

00:36:58.928 --> 00:37:01.335
citizens,
but they're very rare and there

00:37:01.335 --> 00:37:04.219
was always something very
special connected with them,

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:07.472
and there will always be some
Athenians who will raise at

00:37:07.472 --> 00:37:11.131
least one eyebrow at the idea of
making a foreigner a citizen of

00:37:11.131 --> 00:37:13.898
Athens.
But it turned out to be one of

00:37:13.898 --> 00:37:17.729
those things that Solon
instituted that would have long

00:37:17.729 --> 00:37:21.489
range consequences,
helpful to the Athenian state.

00:37:21.489 --> 00:37:25.178
Well, so much for the
economic and social issues,

00:37:25.178 --> 00:37:28.369
let's turn to the
constitutional questions,

00:37:28.369 --> 00:37:31.779
because of course--but when
you're talking about an

00:37:31.779 --> 00:37:35.666
independent republic then the
political and constitutional

00:37:35.666 --> 00:37:39.280
arrangements are obviously
critical to everybody.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.536
I guess it's true in any
society, but it's blatant in a

00:37:42.536 --> 00:37:46.650
republic.
So, Solon changed the Athenian

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.203
constitution.
Up to this moment the Athenian

00:37:50.203 --> 00:37:54.285
constitution came to be what it
was in the way that these things

00:37:54.285 --> 00:37:57.330
happen in nature,
namely, through tradition;

00:37:57.330 --> 00:38:02.409
they just kind of grow.
Nobody legislates.

00:38:02.409 --> 00:38:06.836
But Solon was appointed to
legislate and he was going to

00:38:06.836 --> 00:38:10.699
attempt to deal with the
problems that he saw.

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:16.169
So, what he did first of
all was to arrange Athenian

00:38:16.169 --> 00:38:19.650
political society on a new
basis.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:23.809
This is as very large matter.
Up to now, where you were in

00:38:23.809 --> 00:38:27.554
the state, whether you could
serve on the council,

00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:31.529
whether you could be a
magistrate, depended upon your

00:38:31.529 --> 00:38:35.530
birth.
Aristocrats alone could hold

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:40.174
these positions.
Now that was swept away by

00:38:40.174 --> 00:38:44.353
Solon's new system.
He changed it so that the

00:38:44.353 --> 00:38:48.521
determination of who was
eligible to serve in these

00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:53.690
councils and offices was based
on the wealth that they had.

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:58.637
Just to show you--and this is
an argument against the coinage

00:38:58.637 --> 00:39:03.750
being present in that he did not
fix the rating of citizens for

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:08.423
these jobs in money.
He rated them in measures of

00:39:08.423 --> 00:39:13.233
agricultural produce,
whether dry produce or liquid

00:39:13.233 --> 00:39:19.315
produce, equally available.
These measures of produce were

00:39:19.315 --> 00:39:25.110
called medimnoi measures.
So here's how he worked it out.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:30.770
At the top of the scale
there were five--you had to have

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:36.527
each year products produced by
your land which were worth 500

00:39:36.527 --> 00:39:41.488
medimnoi at least.
So, the people who held that

00:39:41.488 --> 00:39:46.155
position, that condition were
described as--get ready this is

00:39:46.155 --> 00:39:49.410
a jawbreaker,
pentakosiomedimnoi,

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.039
which just means 500
measurement.

00:39:52.039 --> 00:39:55.261
That is obviously a new term,
a new concept,

00:39:55.261 --> 00:39:59.326
didn't exist before Solon.
It makes no sense so Solon had

00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:03.454
to invent that to take care of a
certain class of people that he

00:40:03.454 --> 00:40:06.156
wanted.
But the next class down was

00:40:06.156 --> 00:40:10.402
probably, almost certainly,
used for a condition that was

00:40:10.402 --> 00:40:13.552
already recognized,
but didn't have a formal place

00:40:13.552 --> 00:40:16.718
in the constitution.
People with 300 measures a

00:40:16.718 --> 00:40:20.319
year, but not 500,
were called hippeis

00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:23.779
meaning cavalrymen.
I used that term in another

00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:27.363
place before.
Then people with 200 measures

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:30.367
but not 300 were
zeugitai,

00:40:30.367 --> 00:40:34.030
yoke fellows you remember,
yoke men.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:37.997
Then those below 200 were
thetes and they were the

00:40:37.997 --> 00:40:41.822
lowest class in the Athenian
society invented by Solon,

00:40:41.822 --> 00:40:46.002
again, that was an old term.
The only one that he invented

00:40:46.002 --> 00:40:49.167
was the pentakosiomed
imnoi.Of course,

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:52.662
the critical thing about
it--whatever else I say about

00:40:52.662 --> 00:40:54.320
it,
this is the important thing;

00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:59.397
it broke the monopoly of
aristocrats by birth in the

00:40:59.397 --> 00:41:03.173
political realm.
The first two classes,

00:41:03.173 --> 00:41:07.141
pentakosiomedimnoi and
hippeis,

00:41:07.141 --> 00:41:11.110
could hold the archonships and
only they.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.857
Now, the zeugitai,
as I think I mentioned to you

00:41:14.857 --> 00:41:17.980
before, were essentially the
hoplite class.

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:24.789
That meant they could not hold
the top jobs in the state.

00:41:24.789 --> 00:41:28.659
On the other hand,
he established a council of

00:41:28.659 --> 00:41:32.030
four hundred.
The word for council in Greek

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:35.610
is boule.
So, this boule of four

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:40.576
hundred, zeugitai could
serve on that and we never will

00:41:40.576 --> 00:41:44.809
really know what the powers of
that council were,

00:41:44.809 --> 00:41:47.543
because it doesn't seem--well,
as we shall see,

00:41:47.543 --> 00:41:51.049
Solon's constitution was never
really put into effect in all

00:41:51.049 --> 00:41:54.178
its respects,
although this business about

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:56.750
the measures was put into
effect.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.163
But I think we can guess by
analogy to other councils that

00:42:01.163 --> 00:42:05.111
it would have considerable
power, that it would have

00:42:05.111 --> 00:42:09.596
decided many things.
It would not have been an empty

00:42:09.596 --> 00:42:14.681
honor to be on the council of
400, nor were the thetes

00:42:14.681 --> 00:42:18.239
excluded from political power
entirely.

00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:21.989
They, of course,
made up a part of the assembly;

00:42:21.989 --> 00:42:25.542
the Greek word is
ekklesia and there was

00:42:25.542 --> 00:42:28.940
certainly an ekklesia
before Solon.

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:32.614
You always, in any state that
we know of in the Greek world,

00:42:32.614 --> 00:42:35.789
if you want to go to war you
must go to the army.

00:42:35.789 --> 00:42:38.375
Now, the thetes didn't
fight as hoplites,

00:42:38.375 --> 00:42:40.849
but they could fight as light
armed troops.

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:44.365
So, I'm sure they were
consulted, although it was

00:42:44.365 --> 00:42:47.415
pretty much a formality.
Nonetheless,

00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:51.614
that's not new,
but what is new and extremely

00:42:51.614 --> 00:42:56.960
important, is that Solon invents
a new kind of court.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:01.987
It is called in Greek the
heliaia,

00:43:01.987 --> 00:43:06.889
and what it is,
is a court of appeal.

00:43:06.889 --> 00:43:09.615
All this time before,
every magistrate,

00:43:09.615 --> 00:43:13.344
as I believe I mentioned,
had a court of his own that

00:43:13.344 --> 00:43:17.360
dealt with matters that were
appropriate to his court and

00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:21.343
that was the end of it.
I suppose, theoretically and

00:43:21.343 --> 00:43:25.421
probably in reality sometimes,
if somebody didn't like what a

00:43:25.421 --> 00:43:29.770
magistrate decided in a court he
could do to the Areopagus and in

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:32.472
very rare occasions,
I would imagine,

00:43:32.472 --> 00:43:35.042
the Areopagus could do
something about it,

00:43:35.042 --> 00:43:38.740
but I think what we have to
assume is that a decision by the

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:42.000
magistrates court was it and the
game was over.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.775
Heliaia,
on the other hand,

00:43:44.775 --> 00:43:48.559
was a court of appeals;
that's critical.

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:52.128
Anybody who didn't like the
decision that he got in a

00:43:52.128 --> 00:43:56.176
magistrates court could take it
to a heliaia and then

00:43:56.176 --> 00:44:00.699
have that decision overturned,
if the court so decided,

00:44:00.699 --> 00:44:04.530
and that court was a truly
popular court.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:09.595
It was open to all adult male
Athenian citizens,

00:44:09.595 --> 00:44:14.949
even the thetes.
That is something very new.

00:44:14.949 --> 00:44:20.381
Really quite radical,
the most radical element surely

00:44:20.381 --> 00:44:26.230
in this very moderate program
that Solon puts forward.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:30.390
Notice, he still gives the
aristocracy privileges that

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:35.101
nobody else has in the right to
hold--I say aristocracy but I

00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.320
mean the richest people in the
state,

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.140
in that they alone could hold
the archonship,

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:44.090
which would have been troubling
to the poor.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:49.005
But then he gives this new
founded court of appeals to the

00:44:49.005 --> 00:44:53.520
poorest Athenian citizens,
which would certainly have

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.125
ranked the rich and that's
characteristic of what he is up

00:44:58.125 --> 00:45:01.412
to.
This court--here's the way

00:45:01.412 --> 00:45:04.437
it worked.
Every year Athenians could

00:45:04.437 --> 00:45:08.971
volunteer to be enrolled in the
panel that would produce the

00:45:08.971 --> 00:45:13.526
courts of the heliaia,
and a number of Athenians on

00:45:13.526 --> 00:45:17.794
this panel was six thousand,
and then on any occasion when

00:45:17.794 --> 00:45:20.789
there had to be an actual court
case,

00:45:20.789 --> 00:45:23.688
then the members,
people on the enrolled

00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:28.296
list--there would be some way of
picking the numbers you needed

00:45:28.296 --> 00:45:31.056
for the jury.
We know how it worked in the

00:45:31.056 --> 00:45:33.569
Classical Period,
but we can't be sure it worked

00:45:33.569 --> 00:45:37.630
the same way in Solon's time.
But in the Classical Period,

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.239
the very complicated way of
choosing jurors,

00:45:41.239 --> 00:45:44.627
which was allotment,
but such a wonderfully

00:45:44.627 --> 00:45:48.534
complicated allotment device,
that it guaranteed that nobody

00:45:48.534 --> 00:45:52.641
would know who was going to sit
on a particular jury until they

00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:56.748
walked into the room and began
to hear the case and that was to

00:45:56.748 --> 00:46:00.970
avoid corruption of a jury.
So, whether that system was

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:03.894
in play or not,
and I don't think it was in the

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.199
detail in Solon's time,
the idea should be clear.

00:46:07.199 --> 00:46:10.837
These things are really going
to be unfixable and ordinary

00:46:10.837 --> 00:46:14.156
Athenians are going to be the
ones who are making the

00:46:14.156 --> 00:46:17.129
decisions.
Later, theoreticians of

00:46:17.129 --> 00:46:22.284
politics of democracy would fix
on that as the single most

00:46:22.284 --> 00:46:27.167
important step towards the
democracy that the Athenians

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:31.838
would ultimately reach,
but by no means would Solon's

00:46:31.838 --> 00:46:35.230
constitution,
if it had been put into effect,

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.250
have amounted to a thorough
going democracy.

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:42.219
Yet, the tradition always was
there that Solon had done

00:46:42.219 --> 00:46:45.159
something democratic,
because as you go into the

00:46:45.159 --> 00:46:47.371
fourth century,
people looking back without any

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:50.159
real good knowledge of what went
on back in those days,

00:46:50.159 --> 00:46:55.340
some of them listed Solon as
the founder of democracy.

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:58.975
But it's also true that the
general understanding was not

00:46:58.975 --> 00:47:01.767
wrong about this,
because there was the same

00:47:01.767 --> 00:47:05.879
tradition at the same time,
that it wasn't the same kind of

00:47:05.879 --> 00:47:08.860
democracy we have now in the
fifth century.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:14.430
It was less democratic;
and I think those traditions

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:20.058
were correct but moderation
again is the example of what I'm

00:47:20.058 --> 00:47:23.297
talking about.
Well, brilliant,

00:47:23.297 --> 00:47:27.909
marvelous Solon was so clever
he realized that when you're

00:47:27.909 --> 00:47:31.505
moderate,
the wonderful achievement of a

00:47:31.505 --> 00:47:35.969
moderate person is that
everybody is dissatisfied,

00:47:35.969 --> 00:47:38.531
because the guys on that end
are unhappy and the guys that

00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:41.499
are on that end are unhappy,
and so he knew that there would

00:47:41.499 --> 00:47:44.320
immediately be efforts to
overthrow what he had done.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.468
So, one of his stipulations was
that the Athenians would have to

00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:54.469
leave his laws unchanged for ten
years,

00:47:54.469 --> 00:47:57.641
and he also knew that his own
life would be extremely

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.240
uncomfortable hanging around
Athens while everybody came and

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.539
said,
what the hell did you do Solon?

00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:09.752
So, he left town and went on
his travels for ten years after

00:48:09.752 --> 00:48:12.739
that.
Well, it saved him a lot of

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:17.654
grief, but it didn't save his
legislation, because there was

00:48:17.654 --> 00:48:21.987
tremendous strife in Athens
after the year of Solon's

00:48:21.987 --> 00:48:25.853
archonship,
indeed, something resembling

00:48:25.853 --> 00:48:29.798
chaos I think.
They were technically years

00:48:29.798 --> 00:48:31.899
of anarchy;
that is to say,

00:48:31.899 --> 00:48:36.075
there was so much dispute and
conflict in Athens that they

00:48:36.075 --> 00:48:39.079
were unable to elect the nine
archons,

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:44.027
just years with no archons,
no name for the year,

00:48:44.027 --> 00:48:48.150
that was how serious the
conflict was.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:52.914
What emerges in our records
about what was happening is that

00:48:52.914 --> 00:48:57.678
localism, regionalism was very
powerful in Attica and it was

00:48:57.678 --> 00:49:02.120
regionalism that was a large
part of the problem in this

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.146
period.
Important figures in the

00:49:05.146 --> 00:49:10.252
aristocracy from different parts
of Attica, each sought to make

00:49:10.252 --> 00:49:14.369
himself the dominant force in
Athenian society,

00:49:14.369 --> 00:49:17.907
and to bring about changes that
were satisfactory to them,

00:49:17.907 --> 00:49:21.320
but they ran into the fact that
they had competition.

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.253
To make it more complicated,
it wasn't even a nice one

00:49:24.253 --> 00:49:27.585
against one thing.
There were three factions that

00:49:27.585 --> 00:49:31.963
were identified by the Greeks,
by the Athenians and they all

00:49:31.963 --> 00:49:34.560
struggled one against the other.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:44.842
Let's start with the
regional character of these

00:49:44.842 --> 00:49:48.116
places.
One such region was called,

00:49:48.116 --> 00:49:51.989
the people in that faction--let
me back up.

00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:55.470
The region was called
peralia and the people

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:59.230
who were in the faction were
called peralioi.

00:49:59.230 --> 00:50:05.885
Modern scholars identify the
peralia with the southern

00:50:05.885 --> 00:50:09.722
tip of Attica,
starting some distance up from

00:50:09.722 --> 00:50:13.502
Sunium on the west coast
carrying a little bit around to

00:50:13.502 --> 00:50:17.614
the east coast,
and that was a region that was

00:50:17.614 --> 00:50:22.789
dominated by that family I
mentioned to your earlier,

00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:28.001
the family that was held
responsible for the killing of

00:50:28.001 --> 00:50:31.918
the supporters of Cylon,
that family were the

00:50:31.918 --> 00:50:35.932
Alcmaeonidae and their leading
figure, at the moment we're

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:40.157
talking about,
was a man called Megacles,

00:50:40.157 --> 00:50:46.795
who was one of the competitors
for the leading position in

00:50:46.795 --> 00:50:49.459
Attica.
According to the ancient

00:50:49.459 --> 00:50:53.270
writers of the fourth century,
very hard to know how much they

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:57.233
really knew about it,
it's a matter of speculation,

00:50:57.233 --> 00:51:02.076
but anyway what they say is
these people wanted a middling

00:51:02.076 --> 00:51:07.564
moderate constitution.
They were probably very close

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:14.874
to trying to retain the Solonian
legislation.Another faction

00:51:14.874 --> 00:51:21.255
were called the pediakoi
and they represented the

00:51:21.255 --> 00:51:26.224
middling part of Attica,
which is in fact,

00:51:26.224 --> 00:51:30.848
the very best land in Attica
where grain and wheat

00:51:30.848 --> 00:51:34.311
especially,
were growable and the richest

00:51:34.311 --> 00:51:38.351
people had their land.
Their leader was a man named

00:51:38.351 --> 00:51:43.201
Lycurgus and they represented
the old aristocracy more than

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:46.757
any other group,
and would have undoubtedly if

00:51:46.757 --> 00:51:50.490
they had had their way,
just undone the Solonian laws,

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:56.859
and gone back to the old days.
They favored some kind of

00:51:56.859 --> 00:52:01.780
oligarchic regime.
Then the third group lived in

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:05.779
the region called
diakrioi and they were

00:52:05.779 --> 00:52:10.239
called diakrioi.
Sometimes some of our sources

00:52:10.239 --> 00:52:13.822
say hyperakrioi;
I'll come back to that in just

00:52:13.822 --> 00:52:15.896
a moment.
Well, I might as well tell you

00:52:15.896 --> 00:52:19.452
about it now.
It is identified with the

00:52:19.452 --> 00:52:25.750
region on the east coast of
Attica, which was called the

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.807
Diakria,
but why they might have been

00:52:28.807 --> 00:52:32.914
called hyperakrioi
is that there was some mountains

00:52:32.914 --> 00:52:35.610
between central Attica and the
Diakria,

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:39.911
which meant hyperakrioi
means beyond the mountains and

00:52:39.911 --> 00:52:43.711
that would have been a
geographical description of the

00:52:43.711 --> 00:52:44.500
region.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:54.296
The leader of this faction
was a man called Peisistratus

00:52:54.296 --> 00:52:57.789
who was a nobleman,
an aristocrat;

00:52:57.789 --> 00:53:02.320
all of them were,
but his family had come from

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:08.360
the Peloponnesus back in the
years of the great migration,

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:13.256
following the fall of the
Mycenaean world and that shows

00:53:13.256 --> 00:53:18.063
you that the Athenians had
brought into their bosoms at

00:53:18.063 --> 00:53:21.190
that time,
and made full citizens all

00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:25.386
aristocrats and leading people,
some people from outside of

00:53:25.386 --> 00:53:28.882
Attica.
Now, it was hundreds of years

00:53:28.882 --> 00:53:34.810
later and Peisistratus arose as
the leader of that place and of

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.759
those people.
Now, he's going to be very

00:53:37.759 --> 00:53:40.249
important;
we need to say a few more words

00:53:40.249 --> 00:53:43.546
about him.
In the quarrel about what shall

00:53:43.546 --> 00:53:48.460
be done Peisistratus and his
group were the most radical.

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:53.541
They represented the views of
the poorest people in Attica and

00:53:53.541 --> 00:53:58.289
pressed for solutions of the
kind that they would like.

00:53:58.289 --> 00:54:01.649
He, himself,
had arisen to power in the

00:54:01.649 --> 00:54:05.085
usual way.
He had been a great soldier and

00:54:05.085 --> 00:54:09.914
had won great victories for the
Athenians and was deeply honored

00:54:09.914 --> 00:54:13.670
for that reason,
and we'll hear more from him.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:19.548
Ancient writers speak of him as
the most demotic,

00:54:19.548 --> 00:54:24.080
the most popular,
the most democratic,

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:27.749
if you will.
So, here are the three

00:54:27.749 --> 00:54:31.169
factions with their local
places, with their policies

00:54:31.169 --> 00:54:34.090
presumably,
and their different leaders all

00:54:34.090 --> 00:54:37.769
struggling for power and
sufficiently equal in strength,

00:54:37.769 --> 00:54:41.530
so that nobody could come out
on top.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.972
Out of this,
and by the way,

00:54:43.972 --> 00:54:49.309
when Solon comes home and the
situation is as unsatisfactory

00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:53.493
as I've described,
Solon becomes particularly

00:54:53.493 --> 00:54:58.386
worried about Peisistratus whom
he has spotted as potential

00:54:58.386 --> 00:55:00.864
tyrant,
and he goes out and he warns

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:04.599
the people against Peisistratus,
but the fact of the matter is,

00:55:04.599 --> 00:55:10.583
he fails and his warnings and
his predictions turn out to be

00:55:10.583 --> 00:55:16.566
accurate, as Peisistratus does
bring about tyranny in Athens

00:55:16.566 --> 00:55:22.753
for the stretch of time that he
and his sons will dominate the

00:55:22.753 --> 00:55:26.258
place.
He was engaged in that war

00:55:26.258 --> 00:55:30.530
against Megara and was the
number one hero in that war.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:34.893
He was wounded and when he came
back he said that he was in

00:55:34.893 --> 00:55:39.632
danger from his enemies who were
going to try to kill him and he

00:55:39.632 --> 00:55:43.619
asked the people to supply him
with a body guard.

00:55:43.619 --> 00:55:47.981
They did so,
and he pretty quickly took the

00:55:47.981 --> 00:55:54.107
opportunity to use his body
guard to seize the Acropolis and

00:55:54.107 --> 00:56:00.691
made himself boss of Athens.
For a five-year stretch from

00:56:00.691 --> 00:56:06.050
about 561 to 556,
he was able to rule Athens.

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:09.710
We know very little about the
details of that period,

00:56:09.710 --> 00:56:13.090
but he was a proper tyrant one
way or another.

00:56:13.090 --> 00:56:19.072
Then the two factions that were
defeated managed to get their

00:56:19.072 --> 00:56:24.956
heads together to plot and to
overthrow the tyranny to drive

00:56:24.956 --> 00:56:28.610
Peisistratus out.
So out, he goes.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:33.375
For a period of time he goes
abroad, wanders around,

00:56:33.375 --> 00:56:36.739
meets with other important
people,

00:56:36.739 --> 00:56:40.270
goes to see other tyrants,
and becomes friendly with other

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:43.064
tyrants.
And he finds one way or another

00:56:43.064 --> 00:56:46.289
to make a lot of money,
and to get very rich.

00:56:46.289 --> 00:56:50.440
This is important because he is
able to use this money for

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.355
hiring mercenary soldiers,
which will play a large part in

00:56:54.355 --> 00:56:57.260
his restoration,
but not the first restoration.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:00.853
That comes about,
because the two factions that

00:57:00.853 --> 00:57:03.900
had gotten together to drive him
out,

00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:09.036
had by now come to quarrel with
one another, and so taking

00:57:09.036 --> 00:57:14.490
advantage of their dissent,
he made a deal with one of the

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:17.458
faction leaders.
It was our old friend

00:57:17.458 --> 00:57:21.367
Megacles, the Alcmaeonidae.
He now united with Megacles,

00:57:21.367 --> 00:57:26.397
and the two of them drove out
their opponents in the form of

00:57:26.397 --> 00:57:31.748
Lycurgus and his people,
and Peisistratus was restored

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:34.929
to the tyranny.
What did Megacles get out of it?

00:57:34.929 --> 00:57:39.291
Well, he got guarantees that he
would be a big shot and one part

00:57:39.291 --> 00:57:42.130
of the guarantee was that
Peisistratus,

00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.646
who had had a wife and children
already--I assume she died,

00:57:46.646 --> 00:57:50.929
the first wife--now married the
daughter of Megacles.

00:57:50.929 --> 00:57:53.696
Time memorial,
that's the way to produce

00:57:53.696 --> 00:57:58.512
political associations;
one guy marries the one's

00:57:58.512 --> 00:58:03.360
daughter.
So, there we are.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:07.850
Now, the story of how
Peisistratus comes back to power

00:58:07.850 --> 00:58:13.103
in this second time is charming,
and I think we have to believe

00:58:13.103 --> 00:58:18.039
it in its general outlines.
Well, you can decide whether

00:58:18.039 --> 00:58:22.057
you want to or not.
The story is told in a couple

00:58:22.057 --> 00:58:26.712
places, but Aristotle and his
Athenian Constitution

00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:31.645
tells it in one way.
Peisistratus got a tall,

00:58:31.645 --> 00:58:36.447
beautiful girl,
and he dressed her up to look

00:58:36.447 --> 00:58:42.558
like Athena and he put her on a
chariot and had her drive

00:58:42.558 --> 00:58:49.106
through the Attica countryside
and his boys running alongside

00:58:49.106 --> 00:58:53.998
her shouted,
Athena is bringing back

00:58:53.998 --> 00:58:59.740
Peisistratus to Athens.
Well, you're not going to cross

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:05.097
your patron deity are you?
So, you can imagine them just

00:59:05.097 --> 00:59:09.824
sort of kowtowing and saying,
hail Peisistratus,

00:59:09.824 --> 00:59:14.204
the favorite of Athena.
Well, the fact that he had a

00:59:14.204 --> 00:59:18.175
lot of soldiers and that he had
Megacles on his side undoubtedly

00:59:18.175 --> 00:59:20.570
played a large part in the
success.

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:26.011
But there he is back,
and everything would have been

00:59:26.011 --> 00:59:30.598
all right I guess,
except that after a while

00:59:30.598 --> 00:59:35.079
Peisistratus--let me back up a
second.

00:59:35.079 --> 00:59:37.757
Peisistratus' wife,
the daughter of Megacles,

00:59:37.757 --> 00:59:41.469
began going home to her father
and mother and telling them sad

00:59:41.469 --> 00:59:44.401
stories,
which is that her husband was

00:59:44.401 --> 00:59:47.210
not performing his husbandly
duties.

00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:50.929
Why was this?
Was she particularly offensive?

00:59:50.929 --> 00:59:53.510
No, there's no such record
as that.

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.165
It's clear enough that what was
worrying Peisistratus was that

00:59:58.165 --> 01:00:02.898
he did not want to mess up the
clarity of the succession of his

01:00:02.898 --> 01:00:06.776
sons to the tyranny.
If he had children with

01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:11.669
Megacles, and they grew up,
maybe they would contest the

01:00:11.669 --> 01:00:16.829
succession and so it was in his
role as a loyal and devoted

01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:21.989
father that he got himself into
all kinds of trouble.

01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:27.085
Well, Megacles felt the insult,
the fact that his grandchildren

01:00:27.085 --> 01:00:30.121
would not be in charge,
and finally,

01:00:30.121 --> 01:00:33.473
I have to believe,
even in a Greek father,

01:00:33.473 --> 01:00:37.480
feeling that his daughter had
been done wrong.

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:42.711
So, he joined up with the
opposition, kicked out

01:00:42.711 --> 01:00:48.007
Peisistratus one more time.
In this second exile of

01:00:48.007 --> 01:00:51.693
Peisistratus,
he goes to various places to

01:00:51.693 --> 01:00:55.811
raise all kinds of money,
gets mercenaries,

01:00:55.811 --> 01:01:01.369
he is supported by--this will
play a role in later events.

01:01:01.369 --> 01:01:05.668
He gets very friendly with the
cavalrymen, the horsemen,

01:01:05.668 --> 01:01:09.579
the nobility of Eritrea,
a town in the northern part of

01:01:09.579 --> 01:01:12.523
the Island of Euboea,
just off the east coast of

01:01:12.523 --> 01:01:14.085
Attica.
By the way,

01:01:14.085 --> 01:01:16.704
remember Peisistratus comes
from that area,

01:01:16.704 --> 01:01:20.213
the east coast of Attica,
and regionalism will not

01:01:20.213 --> 01:01:24.769
disappear from Attica for some
time, and that is significant.

01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:28.110
Anyway, he gets all kinds of
help from overseas and his

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:31.141
wealth and all that,
and this time he's just going

01:01:31.141 --> 01:01:34.519
to fight his way back.
No tricks, no goddesses.

01:01:34.519 --> 01:01:39.080
He lands at Marathon which has
the advantage to him of being

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:43.022
very close to Euboea,
where he's been operating with

01:01:43.022 --> 01:01:47.844
his friends in Eritrea.
It also has a nice flat place

01:01:47.844 --> 01:01:53.125
for cavalry and I'm sure he
acquired cavalrymen among the

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:57.566
mercenaries that he hired.
All of that allows him to get

01:01:57.566 --> 01:01:59.683
his forces together,
and sure enough,

01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:03.433
when he lands at Marathon,
that's his home territory and

01:02:03.433 --> 01:02:07.448
all his people come rallying
round to him and now he has a

01:02:07.448 --> 01:02:11.534
good sized army of Athenians and
mercenaries and he marches

01:02:11.534 --> 01:02:14.473
inland,
and in the middle land of

01:02:14.473 --> 01:02:19.078
Attica, the place called
Pellini, he meets his opponents

01:02:19.078 --> 01:02:24.962
and defeats them in battle,
and makes himself the tyrant of

01:02:24.962 --> 01:02:27.030
Athens once again.

01:02:30.639 --> 01:02:33.813
One of the things he does
by a trick, very soon after

01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:36.136
coming to power,
is to disarm the Athenian

01:02:36.136 --> 01:02:39.361
people,
so that he is now ruling in a

01:02:39.361 --> 01:02:42.590
truly tyrannical way in that
sense.

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:47.671
There's not much pretense at
having achieved this position by

01:02:47.671 --> 01:02:51.713
the popular will.
He's done so by force and

01:02:51.713 --> 01:02:57.261
trickery, and he's prepared to
maintain his power in those

01:02:57.261 --> 01:03:01.273
ways.
But in his actual government of

01:03:01.273 --> 01:03:06.070
Attica and Athens in the
remainder of his life,

01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:12.119
tradition is pretty clear that
he did not rule harshly.

01:03:12.119 --> 01:03:15.403
If we think of the word
tyrannical as meaning harsh,

01:03:15.403 --> 01:03:19.304
he did not rule tyrannically.
In fact, later writers describe

01:03:19.304 --> 01:03:22.622
the way he ruled Athens,
and it's this last period that

01:03:22.622 --> 01:03:25.848
they're talking about I think,
as one that was

01:03:25.848 --> 01:03:29.204
politicos,
meaning moderately and in

01:03:29.204 --> 01:03:33.680
accordance with the way a
polis should be run,

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:37.121
which does not include tyranny.
In fact,

01:03:37.121 --> 01:03:43.226
some later writers picture the
rule of Peisistratus as a golden

01:03:43.226 --> 01:03:46.360
age in Athens.
We'll come back to that perhaps.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.940
But there are two edges to this
thing.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:52.344
There's the notion,
my God he established a tyranny

01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:55.277
which later on in Athens would
be the worst thing in the world

01:03:55.277 --> 01:03:57.730
you could do and yet there's
this alongside it,

01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:02.660
this tradition of a decent
government under Peisistratus.

01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:07.228
Well, let's see what he did.
One thing he did was not to

01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:12.083
repeal the laws of Solon.
They may never have been put

01:04:12.083 --> 01:04:15.030
into full effect,
because of the turmoil but no

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:18.170
one had ever said they're not
the law anymore.

01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:22.178
In fact, Peisistratus let them
be and, in fact,

01:04:22.178 --> 01:04:26.099
he allowed them to function as
they should.

01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:28.800
In other words,
I would think that there was a

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:31.980
council of 400 that was elected
every year and met.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.006
We know there were magistrates,
there were archons

01:04:35.006 --> 01:04:37.330
elected in the appropriate way
each year.

01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:47.137
The law courts even met in the
way that they were supposed to,

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:52.633
but what Peisistratus did was
not to change the constitution,

01:04:52.633 --> 01:04:56.510
but to dominate it.
I think you have to imagine

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:58.740
that there is the rule of a
boss.

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:02.987
He doesn't change the laws;
he just sees to it that all the

01:05:02.987 --> 01:05:06.460
appropriate bodies are
controlled by his people.

01:05:06.460 --> 01:05:10.877
That, for an analogy,
is the way the Medici governed

01:05:10.877 --> 01:05:15.554
in Florence and they made
themselves the rulers of that

01:05:15.554 --> 01:05:20.000
republic.
It is true;

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.550
you can't be just totally
gentle.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:25.021
You have to take care of your
enemies, because they're going

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:28.319
to be enemies out there.
So, Peisistratus surely exiled

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:32.297
some aristocratic families,
the ones who wouldn't cut a

01:05:32.297 --> 01:05:35.243
deal with him,
the ones who wouldn't play

01:05:35.243 --> 01:05:37.329
ball;
out they went.

01:05:37.329 --> 01:05:41.286
We know that for some part of
the time, but we don't know just

01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:44.309
when.
He exiled the Alcmaeonidaes.

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:47.151
Of course, he had this quarrel
with Megacles,

01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:51.025
so that was not a surprise and
they could not readily be made

01:05:51.025 --> 01:05:55.186
complacent to what was going on,
although we do have,

01:05:55.186 --> 01:05:59.960
and this is remarkable,
we have an actual inscription

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.285
which is blatantly a list of
archons who held office

01:06:05.285 --> 01:06:09.050
in Athens after Peisistratus'
death,

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:12.480
in the period when his sons
ruled Athens.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.815
One of the names as
archon of the city was

01:06:16.815 --> 01:06:19.900
Cleisthenes, who was an
Alcmaeonid,

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.497
which means makes it perfectly
clear that at least later in the

01:06:24.497 --> 01:06:27.760
day the Alcmaeonids came back
into Attica.

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.845
We have to imagine that
Peisistratus ruled this thing

01:06:30.845 --> 01:06:34.110
with great savvy and there was
always time come home,

01:06:34.110 --> 01:06:38.300
if you would be a good boy and
do what Peisistratus told you to

01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:41.410
do, and I think that happened in
many cases.

01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:50.380
One of the things he did that
was very popular was to invent

01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:53.590
the institution of circuit
judges.

01:06:53.590 --> 01:06:56.891
That is to say,
it used to be that if you were

01:06:56.891 --> 01:07:00.559
an Athenian citizen and you
wanted to go to law,

01:07:00.559 --> 01:07:03.860
originally of course you had no
choice but to go to the local

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:07.159
big shot and have this local
aristocrat settle the matter,

01:07:07.159 --> 01:07:09.579
as had been the case in the
days of Hesiod.

01:07:09.579 --> 01:07:13.074
But under Solon's system,
at the very least,

01:07:13.074 --> 01:07:16.570
you could go to the magistrate
in Athens,

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:20.366
if you wanted to,
and you could even appeal to

01:07:20.366 --> 01:07:25.326
his decision if you wanted too,
but here's the problem,

01:07:25.326 --> 01:07:29.595
what if you lived in Sunium?
You lived miles and miles,

01:07:29.595 --> 01:07:32.822
and miles away from this,
what were the chances that you

01:07:32.822 --> 01:07:35.503
would in fact,
or could go to the city to

01:07:35.503 --> 01:07:37.900
receive the justice that you
needed.

01:07:37.900 --> 01:07:42.000
So, by establishing circuit
justice, brought courts that

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.128
were objective,
that were not dominated by the

01:07:45.128 --> 01:07:48.464
local barons,
he was doing a real service to

01:07:48.464 --> 01:07:52.773
the ordinary Athenian citizen,
and that was seen to be a good

01:07:52.773 --> 01:07:54.390
thing.
But it was also,

01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:58.234
of course, in his interest.
He doesn't want local big shots

01:07:58.234 --> 01:08:01.588
being big shots.
There's only room in a tyranny

01:08:01.588 --> 01:08:05.871
for one big shot and that is the
tyrant, and so he's serving

01:08:05.871 --> 01:08:09.119
himself,
breaking down local power,

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:12.699
unifying the state into a
single thing,

01:08:12.699 --> 01:08:16.279
which is good in all kinds of
ways,

01:08:16.279 --> 01:08:19.409
but it's also good for the
tyrant.

01:08:19.409 --> 01:08:25.430
Now, the next thing I'm
going to say is supposition;

01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:27.669
we don't have any ancient
evidence for it,

01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:29.689
which is, of course,
open to doubt.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:35.532
But I would argue that he must
have confiscated some of the

01:08:35.532 --> 01:08:41.475
land of the aristocrats who
opposed him and with whom he did

01:08:41.475 --> 01:08:46.399
not make a deal.
I say that pretty much only for

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:51.096
this reason.
Before Peisistratus we have the

01:08:51.096 --> 01:08:57.489
story of great differences in
land holding between very,

01:08:57.489 --> 01:09:01.421
very big landowners and very,
very small landowners and those

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:04.390
who own no land at all,
producing the problem.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:08.010
Nothing Solon did directly
affected that situation,

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.979
but when we get into the fifth
century,

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:15.589
the evidence is overwhelming
that we have what I spoke of

01:09:15.589 --> 01:09:18.470
earlier, lots and lots of
medium,

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.510
moderate family-sized farms,
some big farms,

01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:25.540
but these are not what are
characteristic of the place.

01:09:25.540 --> 01:09:28.970
Well, how did that happen?
When did that happen?

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:33.287
My guess is probably
Peisistratus brought that about,

01:09:33.287 --> 01:09:38.270
and if so, it would have been
still another reason why he had

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:43.619
brought popularity,
remarkable popularity.

01:09:43.619 --> 01:09:48.737
The ancient sources do tell us
that among the things that he

01:09:48.737 --> 01:09:51.859
did was to spend money on
farmers.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:55.546
That is, he would give money or
lend money to farmers who needed

01:09:55.546 --> 01:09:59.167
it when they needed it,
which was of course one of the

01:09:59.167 --> 01:10:03.050
issues constantly before the
small farmers of Attica.

01:10:03.050 --> 01:10:07.913
So, with the money they
borrowed, they could buy more

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:12.170
land, and make their farm more
self-sustaining.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:15.461
They could pay off debts that
they owed to other people,

01:10:15.461 --> 01:10:19.052
and they could do the things
that these small farmers have to

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:22.423
do to succeed,
namely, buy the equipment they

01:10:22.423 --> 01:10:24.946
need: olive presses,
wine presses,

01:10:24.946 --> 01:10:29.138
and mills.
They could use their loans for

01:10:29.138 --> 01:10:32.869
planting fruit trees,
olive trees.

01:10:32.869 --> 01:10:37.327
All of these things could have
been part of the story of how

01:10:37.327 --> 01:10:42.011
Athenian agriculture came to be
so successful after the time of

01:10:42.011 --> 01:10:46.000
the tyrants,
as they had not been before.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.869
Now, there's one negative thing
that I'm sure nobody liked.

01:10:48.869 --> 01:10:54.325
Peisistratus instituted the
first regular direct tax that we

01:10:54.325 --> 01:11:00.754
know of in Athenian history.
A five percent tax on all that

01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:08.550
was produced from the land and
that money went to Peisistratus,

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:11.500
and it made him wealthy,
but also provided him with the

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.450
money he needed to be this good
fellow that I have been

01:11:14.450 --> 01:11:16.872
describing.
So, it all assisted his

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:19.010
political power and his
popularity.

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:29.087
Tyrants laid down taxes.
Taxes are evidence of tyranny,

01:11:29.087 --> 01:11:31.988
and all that.
That's not totally the picture

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:34.329
we get.
Aristotle tells this story,

01:11:34.329 --> 01:11:38.290
one day Peisistratus was
traveling around the countryside

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:40.853
of Attica,
as I guess he sometimes did,

01:11:40.853 --> 01:11:43.670
and he went up on the slopes of
Mount Hymettus,

01:11:43.670 --> 01:11:45.649
not too far from the city of
Athens.

01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:48.388
You can go up there today,
the notion of anybody farming

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.430
on that mountain is totally
incredible,

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:53.436
nothing you could possibly grow
on Mount Hymettus,

01:11:53.436 --> 01:11:55.890
but it's been deforested by
that time.

01:11:55.890 --> 01:11:59.592
So anyway, it was still lousy.
I mean, mountains are not great

01:11:59.592 --> 01:12:01.699
places for farms,
you may have noticed.

01:12:01.699 --> 01:12:06.081
So anyway, he goes up to this
farmer and he says,

01:12:06.081 --> 01:12:10.189
"Say farmer what do you grow on
your farm?"

01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:15.453
The farmer, you have to imagine
a gnarled old mean,

01:12:15.453 --> 01:12:20.611
nasty old guy saying,
"On my farm I grow rocks and

01:12:20.611 --> 01:12:25.770
Peisistratus is welcome to his
five percent."

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:30.987
Well, what did Peisistratus
say, off with his head or send

01:12:30.987 --> 01:12:33.878
him on to the moon?
He said, well,

01:12:33.878 --> 01:12:36.159
aren't you a cute little
fellow.

01:12:36.159 --> 01:12:41.262
I hereby declare your farm
exempt from taxes forever,

01:12:41.262 --> 01:12:46.069
and it became a famous thing
the tax free farm.

01:12:46.069 --> 01:12:49.650
It shows up in a Byzantine
encyclopedia;

01:12:49.650 --> 01:12:55.011
that story is still being told.
So, you got a very special kind

01:12:55.011 --> 01:12:58.330
of tyrant here.
We'll turn to the rest of his

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:01.000
reign and that of his sons next
time.

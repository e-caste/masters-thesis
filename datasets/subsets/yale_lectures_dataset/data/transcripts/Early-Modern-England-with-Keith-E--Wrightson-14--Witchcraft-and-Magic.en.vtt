00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.670
Well, in 1921 a group of
workmen working on the highway

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.250
near the village of St.
 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.671
Osyth, which is here in Essex,
in East Anglia,

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:17.030
discovered a skeleton.
 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.492
And at first they thought
they'd uncovered a modern crime,

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.590
but it was soon established
that it was very old.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.576
And subsequently,
on the basis of both

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:30.290
documentary evidence and
forensic evidence,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.880
they identified it as being
probably the remains of a woman

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.680
named Ursula Kemp who had been
executed at St.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.765
Osyth and buried in the
highway, rather than in

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:46.230
consecrated ground,
in the year 1582.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.209
And Ursula Kemp's crime was the
alleged causing of death by

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:53.550
witchcraft.
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.564
Now today, obviously,
I'm going to talk about

00:00:57.564 --> 00:01:02.765
witchcraft and perhaps explain
how it was that people like

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.049
Ursula Kemp came to such an end.
 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.938
First of all we need to start
with a little context by

00:01:09.938 --> 00:01:14.049
discussing the larger place of
not simply witchcraft,

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.195
a specific crime,
but magic within the popular

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.330
culture of early modern England.
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.810
We could perhaps define that
world of magic as being

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.867
essentially a body of beliefs,
a large body of beliefs,

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:35.632
and practices regarding
supernatural power which stood

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:40.577
outside the world of formal
religion and yet were widely

00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:46.061
known and helped people to cope
with their anxieties and their

00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:47.860
insecurities.
 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.751
It helped them to cope above
all because it involved various

00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:59.345
ritual means of manipulating
supernatural powers so as to

00:01:59.345 --> 00:02:04.140
ward off misfortune or else to
alleviate it.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.082
This world of magic,
then, was essentially a world

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:12.268
of trying to propitiate or to
manipulate unidentified

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:16.627
supernatural powers,
largely for the purposes of

00:02:16.627 --> 00:02:18.628
protection and relief.
 

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:23.232
It wasn't--and it's important
to stress this--it wasn't an

00:02:23.232 --> 00:02:25.090
alternative religion.
 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.406
It was a whole mess of
supplementary beliefs and

00:02:29.406 --> 00:02:31.919
practices,
being described by one

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.340
historian as "the debris of
many different systems of

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.360
thought."
 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.896
It was regarded with some
suspicion by the church,

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:43.001
but it was not regarded as a
threat as such,

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:44.949
at least not initially.
 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.162
One historian writing about
popular beliefs has put it

00:02:48.162 --> 00:02:48.949
splendidly.
 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.330
I'm quoting from him.
 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.300
The name's James Obelkevich.
 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.265
"It was a large,
loose, pluralistic affair

00:02:56.265 --> 00:02:59.628
without any clear unifying
principle.

00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:03.758
It encompassed superhuman
beings and forces,

00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:09.040
witches and wise men and a mass
of low-grade magical and

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.729
superstitious practices.
 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:15.878
The whole was less than the sum
of its parts"--

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:19.479
the whole was less than the sum
of its parts --

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:24.441
"for it was not a cosmos
to be contemplated or worshipped

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:29.485
but a treasury of separate and
specific resources to be used or

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:32.819
applied in concrete
situations."

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.340
That puts it extremely well.
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.794
These means of tapping into
supernatural power were very

00:03:39.794 --> 00:03:41.008
widely known.
 

00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.735
You could say they were part of
the lore which was acquired by

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:47.848
every child as part of their
education for life,

00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:51.870
like learning to cross the road
as it were.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.788
But the world of magic also had
its specialists and they were

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:58.532
those who were known as the
'cunning folk',

00:03:58.532 --> 00:04:00.818
'cunning men',
or 'wise women'.

00:04:00.818 --> 00:04:05.070
These individuals were those
who were known to have special

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.175
knowledge over and above the
average knowledge of magical

00:04:09.175 --> 00:04:13.426
practices and who often believed
to have a special inherent

00:04:13.426 --> 00:04:17.240
power,
often inherited.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.009
It was thought to pass in the
blood.

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.290
The cunning folk who were
pretty numerous--

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.680
one survey of known cunning
folk in East Anglia suggests

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.255
that there was a known cunning
man or wise woman within ten

00:04:31.255 --> 00:04:35.612
miles of any village--
these people were appealed to

00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:39.029
for a variety of specific
purposes.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.699
In the first place,
they often were appealed to for

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.019
medical reasons.
 

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:48.523
Very often they had specialist
knowledge of herbs which they

00:04:48.523 --> 00:04:52.033
would administer often
accompanied by spells to

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:56.415
increase their effectiveness--
the psychological effect of the

00:04:56.415 --> 00:04:59.583
incantation going along with
what may well have been the

00:04:59.583 --> 00:05:02.060
practical effect of the herbs
they used.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.490
Ursula Kemp for example was
such a person.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.009
She was known as a healer in
her village.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.329
She was good at curing
arthritis apparently.

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:14.459
Again, they were appealed to
for the diagnosis of witchcraft.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.985
If a person suspected that they
might have been bewitched,

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:21.266
they might go to the cunning
folk for the provision of

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:22.379
counter-magic.
 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.824
They might help the victim to
identify who might have attacked

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:30.980
them in this occult manner and
advise on counteraction.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:34.963
One of my favorite cunning men
came from a town in the north of

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.716
England,
Stokesley, and he was called

00:05:37.716 --> 00:05:41.048
John Wrightson,
and he was known as Old

00:05:41.048 --> 00:05:44.500
Wrightson the Wise Man of
Stokesley,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.769
and people went to him for help
with their horses.

00:05:47.769 --> 00:05:49.120
He was a horse leech.
 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.235
He was very good at telling
whether your horse had been

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:55.004
bewitched and knowing how to
take the appropriate

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:56.160
countermeasures.
 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.257
People went to the cunning folk
also for the recovery of lost or

00:06:01.257 --> 00:06:05.706
stolen goods and they went for
advice and the telling of

00:06:05.706 --> 00:06:08.697
fortunes,
and to this extent the wise

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:12.759
women and the cunning men were
the popular equivalent of the

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.959
astrologers who had a more elite
clientele in this period.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:20.925
So, the cunning folk provided a
variety of real services and the

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:24.577
best of them may well have been
quite skilled therapists in

00:06:24.577 --> 00:06:25.459
their way.
 

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:28.223
One historian of medical
practice in this period says we

00:06:28.223 --> 00:06:31.187
ought to count them amongst the
medical practitioners of the

00:06:31.187 --> 00:06:31.639
time.
 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.932
They were cheap,
they were available and in many

00:06:33.932 --> 00:06:35.250
ways quite knowledgeable.
 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.699
However, the church was pretty
unhappy about this kind of

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:41.769
activity.
 

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:44.769
It didn't like popular magic.
 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:47.639
The official teaching of the
church was that if a person

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.456
suffered any misfortune it must
be the result of divine

00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:51.240
providence.
 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.541
It was either a test of your
faith or, on the other hand,

00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.000
it was a judgment on your sin.
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.798
The only proper response to
misfortune was to search one's

00:07:01.798 --> 00:07:04.930
own heart for the possible
causes of such divine

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.730
intervention:
to pray,

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.350
to repent, to trust in God's
providential purposes.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.259
The church rejected magical
means of relief.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.879
It accepted the possibility,
but it rejected the means.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.778
God could not be commanded by
spells and incantations,

00:07:23.778 --> 00:07:27.850
therefore, if there was any
supernatural response to such

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.829
practices it must be from evil
spirits.

00:07:30.829 --> 00:07:35.125
And so, given these beliefs,
we find the deeply pious of the

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:39.420
period searching their hearts
for the sins which had brought

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.841
misfortune upon them and
sometimes finding quite

00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:44.879
extraordinary answers.
 

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:46.690
You find it in their diaries
for example.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.776
For example,
the diary of the Reverend Ralph

00:07:48.776 --> 00:07:50.675
Josselin,
a minister in the late

00:07:50.675 --> 00:07:54.291
seventeenth century,
who, having lost a dearly loved

00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:56.884
daughter,
searched his heart as to why

00:07:56.884 --> 00:08:00.430
God should have done this,
why he should have taken her

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.098
away, and came to the conclusion
that it was because he had

00:08:04.098 --> 00:08:07.767
neglected his clerical duties
because of his enthusiasm for

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:08.970
playing chess.
 

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.709
He had played chess too much;
God had taken his daughter.

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:16.939
That's the conclusion he came
to and he gave up playing chess.

00:08:16.939 --> 00:08:20.004
This is a seventeenth-century
God, not a nice,

00:08:20.004 --> 00:08:21.980
modern, user-friendly,
God.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.379
&gt;
 

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.286
Little wonder then,
if these were the official

00:08:26.286 --> 00:08:28.898
teachings of the church,
that the greater part of the

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:32.044
population preferred to explain
their misfortunes in terms of

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.765
just bad luck,
or their neglect of protective

00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.693
magic,
or perhaps the malevolence of

00:08:37.693 --> 00:08:40.908
evil spirits and malicious
neighbors.

00:08:40.908 --> 00:08:45.339
Well, this world of popular
magic had long existed and it

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:47.000
was long to endure.
 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.792
You can find much of it still
alive and well deep into the

00:08:50.792 --> 00:08:52.190
nineteenth century.
 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.200
And it endured because in
various ways it helped.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.950
But the problem of witchcraft
is altogether more distinctive.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.506
That involved a specific kind
of magic: the causing of injury

00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:12.971
or death by the malevolent and
malicious use of supernatural

00:09:12.971 --> 00:09:17.139
powers against another or their
property.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:21.548
And that was the practice which
was known as maleficium.

00:09:21.548 --> 00:09:25.606
That's the Latin legal term
which was used for this

00:09:25.606 --> 00:09:27.149
maleficent magic.
 

00:09:27.149 --> 00:09:31.655
And concern with witchcraft in
this way had a quite distinct

00:09:31.655 --> 00:09:32.649
chronology.
 

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:35.980
The possibility of malevolent
magic had always been there,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.952
of course, but concern with it
was undoubtedly at an unusual

00:09:40.952 --> 00:09:46.428
height in the late sixteenth and
earlier seventeenth centuries.

00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:50.375
And the key to why that was so
is perhaps to be found in what

00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:53.269
the historian of the Spanish
Inquisition,

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:56.558
Henry Kamen,
has described as a peculiarly

00:09:56.558 --> 00:10:00.090
horrible conjunction in European
history,

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:04.063
a conjunction he says between
"popular superstition"

00:10:04.063 --> 00:10:06.605
on the one hand and
"ecclesiastical

00:10:06.605 --> 00:10:08.690
fantasy"
on the other,

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.860
the fantasies of churchmen.
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.942
The popular superstitious
element doesn't need any further

00:10:13.942 --> 00:10:15.240
elaboration of course.
 

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:19.133
It had always been the case
that some individuals were

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:23.320
regarded as having this special
access to occult power.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.044
The element of ecclesiastical
fantasy, however,

00:10:26.044 --> 00:10:29.720
that was something that was
peculiar to western Christendom.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.302
We don't find it in the
Orthodox tradition and it was

00:10:33.302 --> 00:10:35.990
peculiar to the early modern
period,

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.597
emerging at the end of the
fifteenth century and growing in

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.340
strength in the sixteenth.
 

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:45.376
Essentially,
it involved the belief that all

00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:50.259
witchcraft in fact involved
worship of the devil,

00:10:50.259 --> 00:10:55.769
and as a result the elaboration
of a stereotype of the witch

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:01.278
which portrayed witches not
merely as dabblers in magic,

00:11:01.278 --> 00:11:04.179
or perpetrators of
malefice against

00:11:04.179 --> 00:11:07.193
neighbors,
but as something much more

00:11:07.193 --> 00:11:11.412
serious,
members of an organized

00:11:11.412 --> 00:11:20.464
diabolical and malevolent cult:
not just village wise women or

00:11:20.464 --> 00:11:25.509
cunning men but enemies of God.
 

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:30.668
Throughout continental Europe,
and indeed in Scotland also,

00:11:30.668 --> 00:11:35.443
the result of these beliefs was
that the main driving force

00:11:35.443 --> 00:11:40.712
behind the spasmodic witch hunts
which can be found in the period

00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:45.873
was probably religious zeal,
and the great witch hunts which

00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:50.679
would be found scattered across
Europe died back only when the

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:55.644
judges came to doubt the reality
of that stereotype of the witch

00:11:55.644 --> 00:12:00.373
and came to doubt the notion
that witchcraft was an organized

00:12:00.373 --> 00:12:03.918
cult threatening to Christian
society.

00:12:03.918 --> 00:12:06.580
One of the first legal
jurisdictions to make that

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.682
decision, that the whole thing
was just a terrible error,

00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:11.899
was in fact the Spanish
Inquisition.

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:15.131
One doesn't usually associate
the Spanish Inquisition with

00:12:15.131 --> 00:12:19.072
progressive movements,
but in 1610 they were the first

00:12:19.072 --> 00:12:22.018
to abandon,
to refuse to deal with,

00:12:22.018 --> 00:12:23.658
cases of this kind.
 

00:12:23.658 --> 00:12:28.940
The French Parlement again did
so in 1640 some years later.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.009
So it gradually died away.
 

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:35.621
But throughout both Catholic
and Protestant Europe for some

00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:40.315
time there was a unity in the
war against witches as enemies

00:12:40.315 --> 00:12:41.190
of God.
 

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.970
Well, how far was that pattern
true of England?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:52.065
The usual answer is that it
wasn't true of England and that

00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:54.350
was for several reasons.
 

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.500
First of all,
the authorities in England

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.349
never actually embraced the full
ecclesiastical stereotype of

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:07.360
witchcraft as evidence of
membership of a diabolical cult.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:11.409
Continental European ideas
about the nature of witchcraft

00:13:11.409 --> 00:13:13.870
were certainly known in England.
 

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.312
Books from Europe were read by
the educated and these ideas

00:13:17.312 --> 00:13:20.399
were disseminated by a number of
English writers,

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:24.370
usually clergymen,
particularly from the 1580s or

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.528
thereabouts.
 

00:13:25.528 --> 00:13:29.232
Gradually, such notions did
seep into popular beliefs and

00:13:29.232 --> 00:13:33.001
you begin to find them at the
popular level by the mid- to

00:13:33.001 --> 00:13:34.918
late seventeenth century.
 

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:39.654
But nevertheless that notion of
the nature of witchcraft didn't

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:42.480
have much influence on English
law.

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:49.120
Witchcraft was never prosecuted
as a heresy in England.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.043
The first act which was passed
against it in 1542 made it a

00:13:53.043 --> 00:13:54.995
felony--
any crime that was a felony

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:58.491
carried the death penalty--
made it a felony to practice

00:13:58.491 --> 00:14:01.129
witchcraft for unlawful
purposes.

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:03.490
But that act was only on the
statute book for five years;

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.408
then it was repealed.
 

00:14:04.408 --> 00:14:07.809
After that there was actually
no law against witchcraft for

00:14:07.809 --> 00:14:09.100
nearly twenty years.
 

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.558
Then in 1563 there was a new
act.

00:14:11.558 --> 00:14:16.485
It was made a felony to invoke
evil spirits and to--if they

00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:21.666
were invoked to cause the death
of another, then execution was

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.278
the punishment.
 

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:27.118
Otherwise witches were to be
imprisoned or put in the pillory

00:14:27.118 --> 00:14:29.870
and face death only for a second
offense.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:33.970
Then finally in 1604 came a
third act.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.860
It elaborated on the 1563 act.
 

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.089
It made it a felony to bewitch
anyone to either their death or

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.129
their injury.
 

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:46.635
For lesser forms of sorcery
people faced imprisonment and

00:14:46.635 --> 00:14:48.970
death for a second offense.
 

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:52.131
But some elements of
continental European ideas were

00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:55.418
beginning to creep in at last in
to this third act.

00:14:55.418 --> 00:14:58.629
For example,
it was made a felony to dig up

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:02.908
dead bodies for the purposes of
practicing witchcraft.

00:15:02.908 --> 00:15:05.172
Exactly why they were concerned
with that they don't explain,

00:15:05.172 --> 00:15:06.870
but that was one of the clauses
of the act.

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:11.251
It was also made a felony to
consult with or to feed an evil

00:15:11.251 --> 00:15:13.110
spirit for any purpose.
 

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:18.888
So, some elements of the notion
of diabolical pacts and the like

00:15:18.888 --> 00:15:23.657
were beginning to creep in but
not all of the kind of

00:15:23.657 --> 00:15:28.884
stereotype of witchcraft which
was well known north of the

00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:33.428
border in Scotland,
or in continental Europe.

00:15:33.428 --> 00:15:37.471
Witchcraft remained seen as not
specifically diabolical but

00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:39.924
rather,
as Keith Thomas puts it,

00:15:39.924 --> 00:15:43.582
an "antisocial
crime," a very unusual one

00:15:43.582 --> 00:15:47.678
but an antisocial crime rather
than a form of heresy.

00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:51.715
And that characteristic,
that it's treated as a specific

00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:54.355
kind of crime,
comes out in the trial

00:15:54.355 --> 00:15:55.308
evidence.
 

00:15:55.308 --> 00:15:58.219
For example,
in English witchcraft trials

00:15:58.219 --> 00:16:02.291
it's very rare to find any
reference to making pacts with

00:16:02.291 --> 00:16:03.308
the devil.
 

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:06.128
You get the odd one in the
seventeenth century but they are

00:16:06.128 --> 00:16:08.918
few;
so no diabolical pacts really.

00:16:08.918 --> 00:16:15.065
No witches' sabbats at which
witches met and feasted and

00:16:15.065 --> 00:16:19.200
danced with the devil and so
forth.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.202
Very little sex with devils in
English witchcraft trials,

00:16:22.202 --> 00:16:25.419
though that was a prominent
feature in continental trials.

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:27.710
English witches didn't fly.
 

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.690
&gt;
 

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:31.196
They didn't have much fun at
all really.

00:16:31.196 --> 00:16:32.200
&gt;
 

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.750
English witches did,
however, have pets.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.745
They had imps and
"familiars"

00:16:38.745 --> 00:16:41.461
as they were known,
usually small animals,

00:16:41.461 --> 00:16:44.320
and they seem to have been part
of popular beliefs in England,

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.964
that a witch would have a
familiar which could act on her

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:47.389
behalf.
 

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:49.591
Ursula Kemp,
for example,

00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:53.995
was alleged to have had four
familiars: two cats,

00:16:53.995 --> 00:16:59.226
a toad which was called Pygin,
and a lamb which was called

00:16:59.226 --> 00:17:00.418
Tyffin.
 

00:17:00.418 --> 00:17:05.528
What the English trials focused
on first and foremost was simple

00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:06.990
maleficent acts.
 

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:12.199
Other elements usually entered
only in a handful of notorious

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:14.368
causes celebres.
 

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:19.377
Witches were always condemned
for maleficium and they

00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:24.980
were hanged rather than burned;
it was a crime, not a heresy.

00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.991
Secondly, particular witchcraft
prosecutions were rarely

00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:29.910
instigated from above in
England.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.818
That's another important
difference.

00:17:31.818 --> 00:17:35.777
There's no evidence that the
authorities actually wanted a

00:17:35.777 --> 00:17:36.680
witch hunt.
 

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.811
One outstanding exception to
this generalization was the

00:17:40.811 --> 00:17:45.095
activities in 1645 to '47 of a
witch finder called Matthew

00:17:45.095 --> 00:17:49.377
Hopkins who operated in East
Anglia and to all intents and

00:17:49.377 --> 00:17:54.037
purposes hired himself out as a
consultant for the discovery of

00:17:54.037 --> 00:17:55.240
witches.
 

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.654
That was an organized witch
hunt from which Matthew Hopkins

00:17:58.654 --> 00:18:01.519
personally profited,
but it's the only really

00:18:01.519 --> 00:18:05.046
outstanding example of such an
outbreak in the history of

00:18:05.046 --> 00:18:06.618
witchcraft in England.
 

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:10.358
It was the subject of a
wonderful Vincent Price movie

00:18:10.358 --> 00:18:12.971
thirty years or so ago,
"Witchfinder

00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:14.588
General,"
which I do recommend.

00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:18.309
It's got nothing to do with the
history, but it's a great movie.

00:18:18.309 --> 00:18:19.890
Okay.
 

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.148
So witchcraft prosecutions in
England tended not to come in

00:18:23.148 --> 00:18:26.240
these witch hunts that would
bring hundreds of cases.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.122
They didn't come in great waves
with the major exception of

00:18:30.122 --> 00:18:32.130
Matthew Hopkins' activities.
 

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.640
They were sporadic.
 

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.588
They were occasional.
 

00:18:34.588 --> 00:18:37.818
They came up one or two at a
time and so forth.

00:18:37.818 --> 00:18:40.846
In addition,
in English law torture was not

00:18:40.846 --> 00:18:44.664
used except in state--certain
state trials when it was

00:18:44.664 --> 00:18:47.980
specially authorized by the
privy council.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.223
In day-to-day trials torture
was not used whereas it was

00:18:51.223 --> 00:18:54.173
routinely used in many
jurisdictions in continental

00:18:54.173 --> 00:18:56.180
Europe and indeed in Scotland.
 

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.058
As a result,
people were not tortured into

00:19:00.058 --> 00:19:01.288
confessing.
 

00:19:01.288 --> 00:19:05.644
As a result,
large numbers of people were

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:11.848
not implicated by people under
torture who named names.

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:15.651
What you get in the witchcraft
statistics from the English

00:19:15.651 --> 00:19:19.385
courts is really a lot of
individual prosecutions brought

00:19:19.385 --> 00:19:22.988
from below by the alleged
victims of witchcraft seeking

00:19:22.988 --> 00:19:26.588
redress in the courts just like
any other crime.

00:19:26.588 --> 00:19:29.675
So there are some important
differences in the way all of

00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:31.328
this was handled in the law.
 

00:19:31.328 --> 00:19:33.834
Nevertheless,
England did share in the

00:19:33.834 --> 00:19:38.030
general European preoccupation
with witchcraft even though to a

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.250
lesser extent.
 

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:44.858
Just how far it shared is not
fully known.

00:19:44.858 --> 00:19:48.191
That's because the relevant
legal records don't survive for

00:19:48.191 --> 00:19:49.798
every area of the country.
 

00:19:49.798 --> 00:19:52.909
They survive pretty fully for
the whole of the southeast and

00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:56.070
for the county of Cheshire but
for other parts of the country

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:59.548
they tend to survive only from
the seventeenth century point,

00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:03.278
which is relatively late in the
history of this crime.

00:20:03.278 --> 00:20:06.990
But where we do have the
evidence, one of the striking

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.980
features is that the trials
appear to have been relatively

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.640
rare except for the home
circuit,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.568
the counties around London.
 

00:20:15.568 --> 00:20:21.720
If you look at the handout,
if you look at the two graphs,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.386
graph A gives you the trials
which took place in different

00:20:27.386 --> 00:20:33.452
assize circuits and the line at
the top showing the real spike

00:20:33.452 --> 00:20:35.838
is the home circuit.
 

00:20:35.838 --> 00:20:39.172
You can see how there are
vastly more cases being heard in

00:20:39.172 --> 00:20:42.796
the whole home circuit than in
any other jurisdiction for which

00:20:42.796 --> 00:20:44.200
we have the records.
 

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.701
The second spike is Matthew
Hopkins operating in 1645,

00:20:47.701 --> 00:20:49.946
but the first spike,
as you'll see,

00:20:49.946 --> 00:20:52.588
was in the later years of
Elizabeth.

00:20:52.588 --> 00:20:56.208
And even within the home
circuit, this area,

00:20:56.208 --> 00:21:00.248
the cases came predominantly
from one part of it,

00:21:00.248 --> 00:21:04.118
the county of Essex to the east
of London.

00:21:04.118 --> 00:21:07.318
If you look at the second
graph, graph B,

00:21:07.318 --> 00:21:11.875
there you have the different
counties of the home circuit

00:21:11.875 --> 00:21:16.513
broken down and it's clear
enough that Essex is absolutely

00:21:16.513 --> 00:21:21.315
outstanding in terms of the
numbers of cases which came from

00:21:21.315 --> 00:21:22.778
that county.
 

00:21:22.778 --> 00:21:26.298
To give you some actual
figures, in the whole of the

00:21:26.298 --> 00:21:29.750
reign of Elizabeth the county of
Hertfordshire,

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.818
which is just to the north of
London,

00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:35.946
quite a populous county,
produced only twenty-four

00:21:35.946 --> 00:21:37.160
witchcraft cases.
 

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:41.154
The county of Sussex,
a large county to the south of

00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:43.740
London, produced only fourteen.
 

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:48.130
The county of Essex produced
172.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.032
In fact, between 1560 and
1680,270 individuals were

00:21:54.032 --> 00:21:58.519
prosecuted for witchcraft in
Essex,

00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:01.779
whereas in comparison,
taking a county of similar size

00:22:01.779 --> 00:22:05.821
and similar population,
in the period between 1580 and

00:22:05.821 --> 00:22:10.136
1709 only thirty-four were
prosecuted in the county of

00:22:10.136 --> 00:22:13.720
Cheshire for which we have good
evidence.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:16.702
So Cheshire,
thirty-four:

00:22:16.702 --> 00:22:18.318
Essex, 270.
 

00:22:18.318 --> 00:22:23.076
In general, most of the trials
for which we have evidence took

00:22:23.076 --> 00:22:27.210
place in the last quarter of the
sixteenth century.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.931
In the home circuit and in
Essex in particular,

00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:36.108
they were at their peak between
the 1570s and the early 1590s.

00:22:36.108 --> 00:22:40.335
Looking at the country as a
whole, trials become very rare

00:22:40.335 --> 00:22:42.558
everywhere after about 1620.
 

00:22:42.558 --> 00:22:46.611
The numbers are falling away
after about 1620 with again the

00:22:46.611 --> 00:22:50.457
notable exception of the
activities of Matthew Hopkins in

00:22:50.457 --> 00:22:55.019
the mid- to late 1640s,
which caused a new peak of

00:22:55.019 --> 00:22:58.368
concern within a downward trend.
 

00:22:58.368 --> 00:23:02.380
Well, that downward trend,
the decline of witchcraft

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.940
cases, after around 1620 is
something which historians have

00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.848
found relatively easy to
explain.

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:14.038
The decline can be explained in
a number of ways.

00:23:14.038 --> 00:23:17.421
First of all,
from at least the 1580s some of

00:23:17.421 --> 00:23:21.800
the justices of the peace and
the assize judges who had to

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.258
handle these cases were very
worried about the difficulties

00:23:26.258 --> 00:23:28.410
of proving witchcraft.
 

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.650
They weren't necessarily
skeptical.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.910
They frequently believed that
witchcraft was possible,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:40.246
but how could you prove in law
that a particular individual was

00:23:40.246 --> 00:23:44.118
actually responsible unless they
confessed?

00:23:44.118 --> 00:23:47.294
How could you prove that
something was caused by

00:23:47.294 --> 00:23:49.994
witchcraft rather than by
natural causes,

00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:53.710
if for example someone died of
a lingering illness?

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.848
And even if it was witchcraft,
who did it?

00:23:57.848 --> 00:24:01.730
So they were worried about the
problem of proof and they talked

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.420
about it.
 

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.993
In witchcraft cases normal
rules of evidence could not

00:24:06.993 --> 00:24:09.670
apply and this bothered them.
 

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:12.595
Increasingly in the seventeenth
century, lawyers who were

00:24:12.595 --> 00:24:15.676
worried about all of this became
very unwilling to entertain

00:24:15.676 --> 00:24:16.200
cases.
 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.732
They tried to talk people into
not prosecuting,

00:24:19.732 --> 00:24:24.265
or they were--or they insisted
upon additional evidence if a

00:24:24.265 --> 00:24:26.338
case was to go forward.
 

00:24:26.338 --> 00:24:29.228
In addition,
from the early seventeenth

00:24:29.228 --> 00:24:33.561
century onwards there seems to
have been an actual decline

00:24:33.561 --> 00:24:37.818
amongst educated people in
belief in the very possibility

00:24:37.818 --> 00:24:39.338
of witchcraft.
 

00:24:39.338 --> 00:24:43.258
The conviction grew that it was
a fantasy which had been

00:24:43.258 --> 00:24:47.318
projected onto wretched people
by hysterical neighbors.

00:24:47.318 --> 00:24:52.540
The conviction grew that the
accused did not have the occult

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.319
powers that were claimed,
even if they thought they did

00:24:57.319 --> 00:25:00.028
so;
they were frauds.

00:25:00.028 --> 00:25:03.320
And in the later seventeenth
century there was the growth of

00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:06.778
awareness of the mechanical
philosophy of Sir Isaac Newton,

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:11.015
who regarded the universe as
having been created by God and

00:25:11.015 --> 00:25:14.009
subjected to laws which were
immutable;

00:25:14.009 --> 00:25:17.769
you could not tamper with God's
natural laws through using

00:25:17.769 --> 00:25:19.220
spells and the like.
 

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:24.013
Well, all of this probably had
its influence in the course of

00:25:24.013 --> 00:25:27.288
the decline of witchcraft
prosecutions.

00:25:27.288 --> 00:25:30.862
Though initially it's most
likely that it was the legal

00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:32.886
concern,
the unwillingness of some

00:25:32.886 --> 00:25:35.118
lawyers and judges to handle
these cases,

00:25:35.118 --> 00:25:39.797
which was the main cause of the
falling off noticeable by the

00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:41.980
early seventeenth century.
 

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.665
So in these various ways one
can perhaps satisfactorily

00:25:45.665 --> 00:25:49.078
explain the decline of concern
with witchcraft,

00:25:49.078 --> 00:25:54.439
but we still have to explain
the sixteenth-century rise of

00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:59.608
concern and that turns out to be
much more difficult.

00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:04.040
Much more difficult because
this seems to have been a

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:08.217
genuine popular concern,
with cases coming up from

00:26:08.217 --> 00:26:09.068
below.
 

00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:14.085
One can't simply explain it in
terms of the activities of a

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:16.680
number of bishops or judges.
 

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.266
The dominant explanation was
put forward some years ago by

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:24.167
Keith Thomas and Alan Macfarlane
in two of the pioneering works

00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:27.856
on this subject,
and they explained the rise of

00:26:27.856 --> 00:26:32.907
witchcraft prosecutions in terms
of a detailed examination of the

00:26:32.907 --> 00:26:35.750
circumstances of surviving
cases.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:41.919
Witches were usually women and
they were frequently elderly

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:42.769
women.
 

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:47.766
Witches were usually accused of
bewitching neighbors within

00:26:47.766 --> 00:26:50.474
their own village;
not strangers,

00:26:50.474 --> 00:26:53.009
always neighbors,
people they knew.

00:26:53.009 --> 00:26:58.588
Witches were often poorer than
their alleged victims.

00:26:58.588 --> 00:27:02.059
This suggested that the
accusations were therefore

00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:06.380
arising from tensions between
relatively marginal women in the

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.779
village community and better-off
neighbors,

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:13.190
who might be men or women.
 

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:16.920
Then they looked at the known
circumstances of cases,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.922
and the classic circumstances
were more or less as follows:

00:27:20.922 --> 00:27:23.890
a quarrel would occur between
neighbors,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.049
ending in one of them,
the supposed witch,

00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:30.048
going away cursing or muttering.
 

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:34.846
The victim would then suffer
some form of personal

00:27:34.846 --> 00:27:36.118
misfortune.
 

00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:40.733
The victim would then begin to
entertain suspicion that they'd

00:27:40.733 --> 00:27:42.019
been bewitched.
 

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:45.484
They would talk to other
neighbors some of whom might

00:27:45.484 --> 00:27:49.348
have similar suspicions about
the person they suspected.

00:27:49.348 --> 00:27:53.230
A person would then be
identified as a possible witch,

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.038
as a malevolent person in the
eyes of the village.

00:27:57.038 --> 00:28:01.479
It's possible that some of
those who were so accused did

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:06.402
practice magic and did believe
themselves to have the power to

00:28:06.402 --> 00:28:09.163
harm,
and to some extent they may

00:28:09.163 --> 00:28:12.930
even have used it as a form of
begging with menace.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.096
The quarrels between neighbors
which initiated cases very often

00:28:17.096 --> 00:28:20.859
began when someone was turned
away having been begging or

00:28:20.859 --> 00:28:23.278
asking for a favor of some kind.
 

00:28:23.278 --> 00:28:27.310
It's possible that some of
these marginal women responded

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:31.920
to being gradually identified as
witches by playing the part,

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.470
by scaring their neighbors,
as it were,

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:37.108
into meeting their needs.
 

00:28:37.108 --> 00:28:41.926
That could go on for years and
often did, but eventually some

00:28:41.926 --> 00:28:46.182
incident serious enough to
trigger off an actual court

00:28:46.182 --> 00:28:49.491
prosecution would occur;
perhaps a death,

00:28:49.491 --> 00:28:51.750
something of unusual
seriousness.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.660
When that happened someone
would bring an accusation;

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.250
other neighbors would chime in.
 

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.670
There were lots of such
accusations.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:04.611
Alan Macfarlane found that in
Essex there was an average of

00:29:04.611 --> 00:29:07.328
four accusers for each accused
witch,

00:29:07.328 --> 00:29:09.710
so other people would chime in
with their suspicions.

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.259
Supplementary proofs might be
looked for,

00:29:13.259 --> 00:29:16.748
for example the witch's
mark--the existence on the

00:29:16.748 --> 00:29:21.162
witch's body of a wart or mole
or other mark which seemed to be

00:29:21.162 --> 00:29:25.362
insensitive to pain and which
was thought to be the place at

00:29:25.362 --> 00:29:29.420
which the witch's familiar would
feed on her blood.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.199
If they found such a thing it
was considered additional proof

00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:33.960
and the witch might be found
guilty.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.880
Fine.
 

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.756
Well, those do indeed seem to
have been what one can think of

00:29:40.756 --> 00:29:44.374
as the classic circumstances
though they were by no means

00:29:44.374 --> 00:29:45.150
unusual.
 

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.420
Witchcraft accusations could
arise in other contexts.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.921
They could arise for example as
a result of personal rivalries

00:29:51.921 --> 00:29:53.068
in local politics.
 

00:29:53.068 --> 00:29:56.750
An accusation of witchcraft was
something which was easy to

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.922
throw at another person in order
to discredit them,

00:29:59.922 --> 00:30:02.269
so there are other
circumstances.

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:05.603
Not all witches were women,
some were men,

00:30:05.603 --> 00:30:08.450
though most were women and so
on.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.230
But these do appear to have
been the classic circumstances.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.671
Why then should the late
sixteenth and early seventeenth

00:30:15.671 --> 00:30:19.424
centuries have seen a peak of
such accusations because surely

00:30:19.424 --> 00:30:22.428
one could find such
circumstances earlier and one

00:30:22.428 --> 00:30:24.180
could find them later?
 

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:28.410
Why was that the peak period of
anxiety?

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.788
Thomas and Macfarlane suggest,
first of all,

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:36.191
it was partly because of the
loss of the protective magic

00:30:36.191 --> 00:30:40.200
which had been supplied by the
medieval church.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.118
The Church of England allowed
the belief in witchcraft to

00:30:44.118 --> 00:30:47.034
continue,
but it wouldn't offer

00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:52.073
ecclesiastical means of
counter-magic and it forbade

00:30:52.073 --> 00:30:54.838
people to resort to them.
 

00:30:54.838 --> 00:30:57.849
If that was the case,
then bringing a legal

00:30:57.849 --> 00:31:01.076
accusation, a trial,
and eventually seeking an

00:31:01.076 --> 00:31:05.019
execution would be the only way
out of the impasse.

00:31:05.019 --> 00:31:08.392
A second part of their
explanation is that the reason

00:31:08.392 --> 00:31:12.477
for so many late sixteenth- and
early seventeenth-century trials

00:31:12.477 --> 00:31:16.498
was that because that period was
one of unusual tensions within

00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:19.528
village society,
within neighborhoods.

00:31:19.528 --> 00:31:22.243
It was a period,
as we know, of economic

00:31:22.243 --> 00:31:24.824
distress,
one which saw a declining

00:31:24.824 --> 00:31:28.240
position for the poor,
especially perhaps the elderly

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.509
and marginal poor,
the widowed and so forth.

00:31:31.509 --> 00:31:36.127
The Poor Laws had not yet been
fully put into effect to provide

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:37.470
for such people.
 

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:41.330
Neighbors who themselves were
feeling the pinch might be less

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.420
willing to show charity,
less willing to help.

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:46.200
They might feel uncomfortable
about that.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.118
They might feel rather guilty
about that.

00:31:49.118 --> 00:31:52.592
That might prey on their minds
and make them sensitive to

00:31:52.592 --> 00:31:56.189
misfortunes which they saw as
the revenge of people to whom

00:31:56.189 --> 00:32:00.319
they had refused charity,
people who had perhaps cursed

00:32:00.319 --> 00:32:00.788
them.
 

00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:03.807
Accusing such a person of
witchcraft was a way of severing

00:32:03.807 --> 00:32:07.781
their responsibility,
assuaging their feeling of

00:32:07.781 --> 00:32:12.460
guilt, transferring it to the
accused witch.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:17.328
Well, all of this is an
ingenious explanation,

00:32:17.328 --> 00:32:22.107
which may well hold a great
deal of truth and it's indeed

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:27.483
widely accepted as an account of
the sociology and psychology of

00:32:27.483 --> 00:32:28.848
accusations.
 

00:32:28.848 --> 00:32:32.724
Recently, that explanation of
Thomas and Macfarlane has been

00:32:32.724 --> 00:32:36.403
elaborated by more focus upon
the fact that most of those

00:32:36.403 --> 00:32:39.490
accused of witchcraft were of
course women.

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:42.417
The tensions within
neighborhoods seemed to have

00:32:42.417 --> 00:32:46.220
come to focus upon punitive
action against women above all.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.338
Why was that?
 

00:32:48.338 --> 00:32:52.474
Thomas and Macfarlane suggest
that it was simply a product of

00:32:52.474 --> 00:32:56.266
the fact that most of the
economically marginal and most

00:32:56.266 --> 00:32:59.920
of the aged in particular were
indeed poor women.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:03.000
Some feminist writers see it as
more sinister,

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.180
as constituting an attack upon
women who,

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.714
by their social situation,
or perhaps their aggressive

00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:13.704
personalities,
stood outside the normal

00:33:13.704 --> 00:33:16.720
controls of the patriarchal
household.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.250
It's an important issue,
but one has to pause,

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.711
I think, before jumping to the
conclusion that witch hunting

00:33:25.711 --> 00:33:28.410
was in effect a form of
repression of women.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:33.016
Certainly, it was the case that
the association of witchcraft

00:33:33.016 --> 00:33:36.493
with women specifically,
which was universal,

00:33:36.493 --> 00:33:40.145
derived in large part from
fundamentally misogynistic

00:33:40.145 --> 00:33:41.058
attitudes.
 

00:33:41.058 --> 00:33:43.807
Women were seen as being
morally weaker,

00:33:43.807 --> 00:33:47.753
as more prone to temptation,
as more likely to use occult

00:33:47.753 --> 00:33:51.490
means to revenge themselves upon
their neighbors;

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:54.038
spells were the weapons of the
weak.

00:33:54.038 --> 00:33:58.303
However, witchcraft
prosecutions were not simply a

00:33:58.303 --> 00:34:02.305
patriarchal drive against
marginal, aggressive,

00:34:02.305 --> 00:34:04.480
or troublesome women.
 

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.934
The magistrates who heard the
cases were men but the accusers

00:34:08.934 --> 00:34:11.980
themselves were very often other
women.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.259
The work of James Sharpe
reveals how many of the

00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:18.818
suspicions that led to
accusations actually arose in

00:34:18.818 --> 00:34:21.539
the female spheres of village
life;

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:24.260
they were often initiated by
other women.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.188
Women themselves felt
threatened by witchcraft and

00:34:28.188 --> 00:34:31.956
were deeply involved in
identifying and accusing

00:34:31.956 --> 00:34:32.920
witches.
 

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:38.445
And on the other hand many of
the juries, universally male,

00:34:38.445 --> 00:34:43.018
who heard these cases,
failed to believe them.

00:34:43.018 --> 00:34:46.679
Many accused witches were
acquitted by male juries.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.744
The gender element then is
clearly there,

00:34:49.744 --> 00:34:53.829
but it's complex;
it's paradoxical.

00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:58.226
These issues remain far from
resolved, but they add further

00:34:58.226 --> 00:35:02.621
complexity to any discussion of
the sociology of witchcraft

00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:03.760
accusation.
 

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:09.014
There were a number of other
problems also to which I need to

00:35:09.014 --> 00:35:12.643
draw your attention,
problems relating not so much

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:15.650
to the sociology of specific
witchcraft accusations,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:19.619
but to the history of
witchcraft as a crime,

00:35:19.619 --> 00:35:23.750
and two questions in particular
arise in the English case.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:26.717
First of all,
why were the witchcraft

00:35:26.717 --> 00:35:29.768
statutes passed in the first
place?

00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:33.382
And, secondly,
once they were passed why did

00:35:33.382 --> 00:35:38.759
such an utterly disproportionate
number of the cases arise in the

00:35:38.759 --> 00:35:40.440
county of Essex?
 

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.110
Essex seems to be wholly
unusual so far as one can tell.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.036
If there were neighborhood
tensions which were acute in the

00:35:49.036 --> 00:35:52.219
county of Essex leading to such
accusations,

00:35:52.219 --> 00:35:55.639
why were there not such
neighborhood tensions in the

00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:58.789
counties of Kent or Sussex or
Hertfordshire,

00:35:58.789 --> 00:36:01.958
all of which were places which
had a great deal in common with

00:36:01.958 --> 00:36:04.764
Essex in terms of social
structure or local economy and

00:36:04.764 --> 00:36:05.440
so forth.
 

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:07.460
Why Essex?
 

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.159
Well, some brief suggestions.
 

00:36:11.159 --> 00:36:13.643
First of all,
as regards the laws,

00:36:13.643 --> 00:36:18.309
I think it's worth considering
that these laws were passed when

00:36:18.309 --> 00:36:20.746
they were,
perhaps because of a

00:36:20.746 --> 00:36:22.510
convergence of two things.
 

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:25.155
First of all,
both of the major witchcraft

00:36:25.155 --> 00:36:29.480
statutes in England were passed
at the beginning of new regimes,

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:32.570
one in Elizabeth's second
Parliament,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:37.670
one in the first Parliament of
King James VI and I.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.606
It makes one wonder whether
there was an element in this

00:36:40.606 --> 00:36:45.025
legislation of symbolism;
that acts on this subject were

00:36:45.025 --> 00:36:50.880
passed perhaps as part of the
propaganda of a new regime,

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:55.588
that passing statutes of this
nature in a sense conferred

00:36:55.588 --> 00:37:00.043
legitimacy on new regimes by
showing their firm stance

00:37:00.043 --> 00:37:04.248
against a particularly
symbolically charged form of

00:37:04.248 --> 00:37:05.510
deviance.
 

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.753
To be opposed to witchcraft was
in a sense a declaration of

00:37:10.753 --> 00:37:11.929
legitimacy.
 

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:15.804
The acts may have had then a
certain symbolic function when

00:37:15.804 --> 00:37:19.411
they were passed through
Parliament, without opposition

00:37:19.411 --> 00:37:21.150
so far as we can tell.
 

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:24.628
Secondly, another element of
the timing of the acts is the

00:37:24.628 --> 00:37:27.802
fact that there may have been an
element of political

00:37:27.802 --> 00:37:31.248
contingency,
specifically in the form of

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:35.530
suspected threats to the person
of the monarch.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.956
In 1561, two years before the
1563 act was brought forward,

00:37:39.956 --> 00:37:44.231
a plot had been discovered in
which sorcery was allegedly

00:37:44.231 --> 00:37:46.750
being used against Elizabeth.
 

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.382
William Cecil was horrified to
find, when the plot was

00:37:49.382 --> 00:37:52.166
uncovered, that there was
actually nothing on the statute

00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:53.309
book forbidding it.
 

00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:56.695
This may have been a contingent
political reason for moving

00:37:56.695 --> 00:37:58.679
ahead with a witchcraft statute.
 

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:01.954
It may have persuaded him to go
along with one or two of the

00:38:01.954 --> 00:38:05.230
bishops who were themselves
interested in having legislation

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.230
on this issue.
 

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.746
That's an interpretation,
then, which might be

00:38:09.746 --> 00:38:14.278
particularly relevant to the
passage of the 1563 act though

00:38:14.278 --> 00:38:18.655
the full details of its passage
through Parliament remain

00:38:18.655 --> 00:38:22.429
unknown;
the documentation is too poor.

00:38:22.429 --> 00:38:25.409
The act of 1604 is a lot
clearer.

00:38:25.409 --> 00:38:30.065
Following the accession of
James VI of Scotland as James I

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:33.242
of England,
he was a man with a profound

00:38:33.242 --> 00:38:36.324
interest in witchcraft,
he'd written a book about it on

00:38:36.324 --> 00:38:38.492
the subject in--
he'd written a book about the

00:38:38.492 --> 00:38:41.887
subject in Scotland--
following his accession and the

00:38:41.887 --> 00:38:45.315
union of crowns,
the witchcraft statutes of both

00:38:45.315 --> 00:38:48.851
England and Scotland were
overhauled and revised by a

00:38:48.851 --> 00:38:51.230
committee of judges and bishops.
 

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:53.860
This again may have been a
symbolic act.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:55.320
They decided to do it then.
 

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.090
Why then?
 

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:00.547
It's a new regime and a new act
was passed in Scotland at the

00:39:00.547 --> 00:39:01.440
same time.
 

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.405
It may have been helped along
again by the fact that in 1604

00:39:05.405 --> 00:39:08.902
there was a particularly
notorious witchcraft case in

00:39:08.902 --> 00:39:12.206
London itself,
which may have drawn attention

00:39:12.206 --> 00:39:14.030
to the problem once again.
 

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:18.798
So what I'm suggesting is that
these acts of Parliament were

00:39:18.798 --> 00:39:22.518
essentially introduced as
legitimizing symbols:

00:39:22.518 --> 00:39:27.449
good and godly laws introduced
by good and godly regimes.

00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:31.277
Yet there's no evidence that
the authorities that put them on

00:39:31.277 --> 00:39:34.340
the statute book actually wanted
a witch hunt.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.489
If they'd wanted one,
they could have had one.

00:39:37.489 --> 00:39:39.489
But they didn't.
 

00:39:39.489 --> 00:39:44.141
What they did was to make
witchcraft prosecutions possible

00:39:44.141 --> 00:39:48.112
in the royal courts--
and to that extent the

00:39:48.112 --> 00:39:53.248
political and ecclesiastical
elite had a bigger role in

00:39:53.248 --> 00:39:59.146
making possible the prosecutions
which took place than is often

00:39:59.146 --> 00:40:00.670
recognized.
 

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:05.643
So one can perhaps explain why
the acts were put on the statute

00:40:05.643 --> 00:40:09.655
book in that kind of way,
but that still leaves the

00:40:09.655 --> 00:40:11.340
problem of Essex.
 

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.840
Why Essex?
 

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:19.005
Is it possible that Essex as a
local society was peculiarly

00:40:19.005 --> 00:40:22.570
conscious of the threat of
witchcraft?

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.610
But why should that be so?
 

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.391
It's quite clear that people
might feel threatened by

00:40:29.391 --> 00:40:32.518
maleficium in any part of
England.

00:40:32.518 --> 00:40:37.724
Why should they act against it
so much more in the county of

00:40:37.724 --> 00:40:38.429
Essex?
 

00:40:38.429 --> 00:40:43.481
And the only suggestion I can
make on that issue is that the

00:40:43.481 --> 00:40:48.190
use of the criminal law against
witches had had terrible

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.159
publicity in Essex.
 

00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:54.923
Essex was unusual in the sense
that it saw three causes

00:40:54.923 --> 00:40:57.849
celebres,
three group trials.

00:40:57.849 --> 00:41:00.880
They took place in 1566,
only three years after the

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.480
passage of Elizabeth's statute;
in 1582;

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.369
and in 1589.
 

00:41:07.369 --> 00:41:11.342
In each of these cases an
initial accusation was

00:41:11.342 --> 00:41:15.739
vigorously pursued by local
justices of the peace who

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:20.052
happened to have a particular
personal concern about

00:41:20.052 --> 00:41:21.489
witchcraft.
 

00:41:21.489 --> 00:41:25.369
That meant that instead of just
one person going on trial small

00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:28.811
groups of women went on trial
and these trials were well

00:41:28.811 --> 00:41:32.317
publicized in pamphlets which
were written about them and

00:41:32.317 --> 00:41:34.320
which survive to this day.
 

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.670
You can read them on Early
English Books Online.

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:41.724
All of this,
then, may have given peculiar

00:41:41.724 --> 00:41:47.364
publicity to witchcraft as a
threat and what could be done

00:41:47.364 --> 00:41:48.650
about it.
 

00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:51.130
One wonders,
then, whether a number of

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:55.085
particularly scandalous local
cases occurring in this county

00:41:55.085 --> 00:41:59.108
had the effect of heightening
anxiety about witchcraft within

00:41:59.108 --> 00:42:02.246
Essex,
enhancing the sense of threat

00:42:02.246 --> 00:42:05.775
which people felt,
making it more intense than

00:42:05.775 --> 00:42:09.610
elsewhere,
and of course providing an

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:13.940
object lesson in how to deal
with it.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.452
So are we dealing then with a
moral panic breaking out within

00:42:18.452 --> 00:42:22.740
a particular local society,
which subsequently died down in

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:26.802
the seventeenth century until it
was artificially revived again

00:42:26.802 --> 00:42:29.489
by the activities of Matthew
Hopkins,

00:42:29.489 --> 00:42:34.989
the Witchfinder General,
in 1645?

00:42:34.989 --> 00:42:39.268
Ursula Kemp incidentally was
one of the women tried in one of

00:42:39.268 --> 00:42:41.980
those group trials,
the one of 1582.

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:46.574
So to conclude:
the whole issue of the history

00:42:46.574 --> 00:42:50.083
of witchcraft,
why people were so concerned

00:42:50.083 --> 00:42:52.619
with it at a particular point in
time,

00:42:52.619 --> 00:42:56.440
is clearly enormously complex.
 

00:42:56.440 --> 00:43:01.253
But what I'm suggesting is that
first, the case of England was

00:43:01.253 --> 00:43:06.226
different to a degree from what
was going on elsewhere in Europe

00:43:06.226 --> 00:43:07.489
at the time.
 

00:43:07.489 --> 00:43:11.353
There were no mass witch hunts
to marry popular superstition

00:43:11.353 --> 00:43:15.085
and ecclesiastical fantasy in
the way one found in various

00:43:15.085 --> 00:43:19.449
parts of Europe and in Scotland,
Matthew Hopkins excepted.

00:43:19.449 --> 00:43:24.164
Secondly, in England witchcraft
prosecutions did come up

00:43:24.164 --> 00:43:29.137
spontaneously from below and
they probably usually arose in

00:43:29.137 --> 00:43:34.452
pretty much the way Thomas and
Macfarlane and James Sharpe have

00:43:34.452 --> 00:43:37.467
suggested,
as far as individual cases were

00:43:37.467 --> 00:43:40.244
concerned,
though it was an accusation

00:43:40.244 --> 00:43:45.074
which could also be used for
malicious prosecution and was so

00:43:45.074 --> 00:43:45.719
used.
 

00:43:45.719 --> 00:43:48.900
But thirdly,
these cases could only arise

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:53.831
because of the existence of laws
which were perhaps essentially

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:57.409
symbolic and contingent in their
origins.

00:43:57.409 --> 00:44:01.286
And that once those laws
existed, fourthly,

00:44:01.286 --> 00:44:04.610
the cases arose only
sporadically.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:08.731
The sense we have of a definite
chronological pattern in

00:44:08.731 --> 00:44:13.152
witchcraft prosecutions is very
heavily influenced as you've

00:44:13.152 --> 00:44:15.849
seen by the case of Essex alone.
 

00:44:15.849 --> 00:44:20.411
Essex does seem to have been
unique for very special reasons

00:44:20.411 --> 00:44:24.820
which we may never be able to do
more than to guess at.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.030
Elsewhere in the country cases
arose sporadically,

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.992
occasionally,
no clear pattern beyond the

00:44:31.992 --> 00:44:36.438
fact that they were more common
in the late sixteenth century

00:44:36.438 --> 00:44:37.550
than later.
 

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:41.143
And finally,
there was no English witch hunt

00:44:41.143 --> 00:44:46.072
because at the end of the day
the authorities in both church

00:44:46.072 --> 00:44:48.579
and state didn't want one.
 

00:44:48.579 --> 00:44:52.434
They never felt sufficiently
threatened to instigate one

00:44:52.434 --> 00:44:55.380
against those they deemed their
enemies.

00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:01.090
The potential for a witch hunt
was there and it long continued.

00:45:01.090 --> 00:45:04.239
Village tensions hadn't faded.
 

00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:06.980
The difference of the
seventeenth century from the

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.000
later sixteenth century was
above all that the judicial

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.018
authorities not only failed to
seek a witch hunt,

00:45:13.018 --> 00:45:17.668
but actually became active in
suppressing the accusations

00:45:17.668 --> 00:45:20.409
which were brought before them.
 

00:45:20.409 --> 00:45:24.965
So then, I suspect that overall
both the rise and the fall of

00:45:24.965 --> 00:45:29.443
witchcraft prosecution is best
explained by the way in which

00:45:29.443 --> 00:45:32.329
the law first of all gave
people,

00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:34.860
and then later took away from
them,

00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:38.577
the opportunity to settle a
particular kind of personal

00:45:38.577 --> 00:45:42.501
conflict through the use of the
law and the prosecution of

00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:44.360
people to their deaths.
 

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:47.878
The beliefs behind all of that
were very ancient and they long

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:50.382
continued,
but the history of witchcraft

00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:54.070
is very much to do with the use
of the criminal law in the way

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.159
I've described.
 

00:45:55.159 --> 00:45:59.070
The crucial issue was perhaps
that for a short while,

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.780
for two generations,
there was indeed a conjunction

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:06.418
of long-standing patterns of
popular belief with a

00:46:06.418 --> 00:46:11.018
shorter-term enhancement of the
anxieties and the credulousness

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:12.429
of the elite.
 

00:46:12.429 --> 00:46:16.757
It was they who passed the laws
that made witchcraft trials

00:46:16.757 --> 00:46:17.579
possible.
 

00:46:17.579 --> 00:46:20.820
They later repented of their
folly.

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:26.211
They avoided the enforcement of
those laws and eventually,

00:46:26.211 --> 00:46:29.050
in 1736, they repealed them.
 

00:46:29.050 --> 00:46:32.896
But that, of course,
was about 150 years too late

00:46:32.896 --> 00:46:34.340
for Ursula Kemp.
 

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:40.000

J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So as you
remember the first

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:07.233
semester we studied bonding
and molecular structure.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.033
Then toward the end we did some
sort of thermodynamics,

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:13.967
which is what connects structure
to energy, which is

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:17.200
what determines what chemistry
will happen.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.533
So this semester we're going to
talk about that chemistry,

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:25.267
about reaction mechanisms, and
about using these reactions to

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:26.567
do synthesis.

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:29.067
And we'll also do some
spectroscopy around the middle

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:30.367
of the semester.

00:00:30.367 --> 00:00:33.833
So just a brief excursion
through what

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.267
we're going to be doing.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.033
The first two quarters of the
semester are going to be on

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:41.800
how mechanisms are discovered
and understood in terms of

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.400
structure and energy-- what
we talked about last time.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.467
So first we'll look naturally
enough at

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.300
the simplest reactions.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.267
There can't be anything
much simpler than

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.433
just cleaving a bond.

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:56.633
But remember there's also the
possibility of making a bond

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:59.233
at the same time you
break a bond.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.967
And we introduced these ideas
last semester, of course.

00:01:02.967 --> 00:01:05.567
So we're going to start with
free-radical substitution, one

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:08.433
of the earlier reactions to be
studied, as you remember, in

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.833
the 1830s in France.

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.367
But we're going to use it to
talk about the concepts of

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:17.433
reactivity and selectivity--

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.267
when you can get different
products, how do you control

00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.500
or predict which ones
you'll get?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.633
Then the nice thing about free
radicals is they're not

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:30.633
charged, so they're relatively
insensitive to solvent.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.000
So you can just think about
the molecules themselves

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
reacting, whether it's in the
gas phase or solution, more or

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200
less the same thing.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.867
But it's quite different when
ions are involved either as

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.700
starting materials or
products or both.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.033
Because then solvent effects
are very important.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.900
So as we go from free radicals,
we're then going to

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.367
do solvent effects.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.600
Then go on to nucleophilic
substitution reactions, which

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.300
almost always involve ions
either as starting materials

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.200
or products or both.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.833
And going to use that as an
example of showing how people

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:07.067
go about proving
a mechanism.

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:10.200
Then we'll have the first
exam on February 2.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.433
Then we'll go on to
electrophilic addition

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.033
reactions to alkenes
and alkynes.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:19.567
You'll recognize that these
are concepts we introduced

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.500
last semester, but this time
we're going to focus on how

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.933
you know about how they work.

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:27.367
And we're going to talk there,
especially about the role of

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:28.300
nucleophiles.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.233
You usually call these additions
electrophilic, but

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:35.467
there's quite often a very
important nucleophilic

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.433
component as well.

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:40.900
Then we'll get onto polymers and
their properties for just

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.467
a lecture or two.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:46.600
And then conjugation,
aromaticity and pericyclic

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.400
reactions, which you'll
know what they are

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.033
when we get to them.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.533
Then we'll have the
second exam.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.600
And then we'll have an interlude
about spectroscopy

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.833
and go on to more focus
on synthesis.

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:01.633
So first, spectroscopy for
structure and also for

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.167
studying dynamics of molecules
and reactions.

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:09.800
So ultraviolet-visible
spectroscopy; electronic; IR

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.733
spectroscopy--

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.133
vibration, which we've talked
about a good deal already;

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:18.200
magnetic resonance imaging and
nuclear magnetic resonance.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.867
Then on to aromatic
substitution.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:25.133
And finally carbonyl chemistry
and the concepts of oxidation

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:25.767
and reduction.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:27.833
Then we'll have the
third hour exam.

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.533
And the last quarter of the
course then will be more

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:33.767
having to do with carbonyl
chemistry; acid derivatives;

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:38.467
substitution taking place at
carbonyl group; reactivity

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.100
adjacent to the carbonyl
group; the classical

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.033
condensation reactions; then
something about carbohydrates

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:47.767
and Fischer's classical
proof of which

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:50.033
isomer is which of glucose.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.067
And finally we'll talk about
some complex synthesis.

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:55.267
We'll be talking about synthetic
ideas all through

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:59.967
this, of both unnatural
and natural products.

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:01.267
Then we'll have the final.

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:03.533
So that's how long you
have to endure.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.267
So at the end of last semester
we were talking about energy

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:11.133
and how it related to things--

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.733
that free energy determines
what can happen at

00:04:13.733 --> 00:04:14.467
equilibrium--

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.333
and remember it was
all statistics.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:19.500
And the statistics filtered
down to give us this handy

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.833
relationship at room
temperature that an

00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:24.833
equilibrium constant is 10
to the minus 3/4 of the

00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:26.233
difference in free energy.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.833
Or if you're not worried about
entropy, the difference in

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:33.033
enthalpy in the heat
of the molecules.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.700
So that's both energy
and entropy

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.367
the Gibbs free energy.

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:40.400
But there's a completely
independent question, which is

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.900
Will it happen?

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.033
You know, graphite is more
stable than diamond

00:04:45.033 --> 00:04:46.933
as a form of carbon.

00:04:46.933 --> 00:04:50.833
But the advertisers tell us that
a diamond is forever--

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.067
just because it's not as stable
doesn't mean it'll

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:55.633
convert in any reasonable
time.

00:04:55.633 --> 00:04:59.900
So the questions of kinetics are
just as important as the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.633
questions of equilibrium, or at
least almost as important.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.833
And we saw last time that we
could approach this by

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:12.167
studying lots of trajectories,
trying to calculate how all

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.733
the atoms move in
going from one

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:15.667
arrangement to another one.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.300
But that really provides
too much detail.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.367
In fact, over the last couple of
weeks we've had interviews

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:24.667
from people who are applying
for a faculty position here

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.200
and a number of them are talking
about fancy new ways

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.167
of actually looking
at one molecule at

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:32.467
a time as it reacts.

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:36.467
So that you actually could do
something getting closer to

00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:37.633
trajectories.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:41.967
But really that's more detailed
than we want.

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:44.600
We want to summarize things
statistically to know what's

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.500
going to happen in a flask.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.600
So we have collective concepts,
enthalpy and

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.633
entropy, and then we can have a

00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:54.467
reaction coordinate diagram--

00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:57.533
remember we rolled a marble on
that thing last time, on that

00:05:57.533 --> 00:05:59.467
potential energy surface.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:02.300
Or we could slice along the
potential energy surface and

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.333
look at the starting material,
the transition

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:07.167
state and the products.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:12.567
Or we could simplify things to
notice that this is just a

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:16.300
sequence of three species: the
starting material which is

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.133
molecules that we know about,
the transition state which we

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:25.300
don't know about, and the
products which we know about.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.300
So our challenge is going to
be to try to figure out

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.033
something about the transition
state given what we know about

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:34.667
the starting material and the
products, because its energy

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:37.133
relative to those others is
going to determine rates.

00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:44.700
So we have then free energies
with just these three species,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.300
rather than trying to look
at a detailed trajectory.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:54.433
So free energy determines what
can happen at equilibrium, but

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:57.033
also how fast it happens
in kinetics.

00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:01.667
For that purpose we need to
know what the energy is,

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:04.267
either the free energy or
the heat at least of the

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:06.300
transition state.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.100
And remember we talked about
this last time that in

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.700
Eyring's transition state
theory, the rate constant for

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.533
the reaction per second is
10 to the 13th times that sort

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:21.900
of equilibrium constant between
the starting material and the

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.233
transition state.

00:07:23.233 --> 00:07:27.267
So again, we can use at room
temperature that 3/4 delta G

00:07:27.267 --> 00:07:31.500
when we express it in
kilocalories per mole.

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.500
So we want to use energies to
predict equilibria and also to

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.467
predict rates first
for the very

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:40.133
simplest one step reactions.

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:43.333
And no reaction is conceptually
simpler than just

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:45.533
breaking a bond in the
gas phase to give

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.300
atoms or free radicals.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.767
So we need to know the
energy for that.

00:07:49.767 --> 00:07:53.033
Now, in the textbooks that I've
handed out to you there

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:54.833
are tables like this
one that give

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.933
bond dissociation energies.

00:07:56.933 --> 00:08:00.700
How much energy does is actually
take to break a bond?

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.133
This particular one is from a
text we used to use in the

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.400
course called Streitwieser
and Heathcock.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.867
That was in 1993, but as of
2003 there's a new set.

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:13.767
And you can see that
these don't change

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:15.633
very much in time--

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:19.600
98 became 99, 111 became 113.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.733
Some of them are a
little bigger--

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:23.367
81 became 85, and so on.

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:26.167
And these values I refer
to as Ellison's.

00:08:26.167 --> 00:08:28.400
I mentioned him last
semester--

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.467
there's Barney Ellison.

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:34.667
He and his friends compiled
these new values, and he's

00:08:34.667 --> 00:08:37.067
going to come and talk to you
about how he did this

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:38.767
in April some time.

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:42.733
He can't get out of Boulder
now-- he's all snowed in out

00:08:42.733 --> 00:08:45.467
there, Colorado.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:50.133
So this is his table of
molecular bond dissociation

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:53.533
energies for losing
H from something.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.267
RH becomes R plus H atom--

00:08:56.267 --> 00:08:58.433
R radical plus H atom.

00:08:58.433 --> 00:09:01.033
So these are experimental
bond enthalpies.

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:04.000
And as you can see, some of them
are known to very high

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.267
precision, like H2 is known to
six significant figures.

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:12.567
Most of them, of course, aren't
known that well, but

00:09:12.567 --> 00:09:15.067
most of the ones in this table
are known pretty darn well,

00:09:15.067 --> 00:09:18.300
plenty accurately enough
for our purposes.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.267
Let's see if we can understand
some of these so that we don't

00:09:21.267 --> 00:09:23.500
have to memorize the table.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Let's look at the bonds
from H to halogen.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.300
You'll notice as we go down to
larger halogens from fluorine,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.700
chlorine, bromine, iodine,
we go from 136 to

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.100
103 to 87 to 71--

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:40.300
quite a difference in
the energy involved.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:44.267
So the idea is that larger
halogens don't overlap as well

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:47.000
with the hydrogens, so they
don't make as strong a bond at

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.867
their normal bond distances.

00:09:48.867 --> 00:09:53.433
And there's less electron
transfer to the halogen.

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:57.200
So whereas HF looks like that
and the two electrons are

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.000
lowered quite a bit, in HI the
net amount of lowering of the

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.833
electrons in forming the bond
isn't nearly as much.

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:07.700
So that makes sense to us.

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.600
So less electron stabilization
means a weaker bond.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.867
Now here's the Table 2, which
is bond enthalpies for

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:23.400
various atoms or groups
attached to various

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.667
hydrocarbon radicals.

00:10:30.767 --> 00:10:35.100
Previously we looked at H
attached to halogen, now we're

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:38.133
looking at methyl attached to
halogen and you see there's a

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.400
very similar trend.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:43.400
It's strongest for fluorine,
weaker for chlorine, weaker

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.667
still for bromine, and
weakest for iodine.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.633
So many of the same features.

00:10:49.633 --> 00:10:52.633
But let's try to understand
different radicals.

00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:56.233
So we're going to look at the
bonding of H to methyl, ethyl,

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:58.600
isopropyl and t-butyl.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.833
And the first thing you notice
about this is that they're all

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:04.400
almost the same.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.267
As we went down the halogens
it varied by 60

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.200
kilocalories per mole.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.433
But as we go across these
different methyl, ethyl,

00:11:12.433 --> 00:11:16.300
isopropyl, t-butyls, they're all
100 kilocalories per mole,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.733
plus or minus 5.

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:21.367
We're going to look next lecture
at this in some more

00:11:21.367 --> 00:11:23.533
detail and see if we
can understand why

00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:24.767
they vary at all.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:26.700
But they don't vary very much.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.267
On the other hand, some
hydrocarbon radicals have

00:11:31.267 --> 00:11:35.267
substantially different ones,
like vinyl and allyl, phenyl

00:11:35.267 --> 00:11:36.200
and benzyl.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.733
The vinyl and phenyl are
much stronger, 10

00:11:38.733 --> 00:11:40.567
kilocalories stronger.

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:46.467
The benzyl and allyl are about
10 kilocalories weaker.

00:11:46.467 --> 00:11:51.400
So let's see if, based on what
we did last semester, we can

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.267
understand why this
might be so.

00:11:54.267 --> 00:11:57.767
Are these unusual bond
dissociation energies to be

00:11:57.767 --> 00:12:01.800
explained as unusual bonds,
that is the bonds are

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.767
unusually strong or weak?

00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:07.733
Or is it the radicals are
unusually strong or weak?

00:12:07.733 --> 00:12:09.800
This is compared to what?

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.500
We have the starting material
and go to the products where

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.267
the bond is broken,
we go uphill in

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.867
energy by these amounts.

00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:20.267
The question is are things
unusual because the starting

00:12:20.267 --> 00:12:24.100
bond is weak or unusually
strong?

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.433
Or is it because the radical
is unusually stable or

00:12:27.433 --> 00:12:30.000
unusually unstable?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.467
Compared to what?

00:12:31.467 --> 00:12:34.200
So let's look at a couple of
these cases and see if we

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.267
could understand.

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:40.400
First let's look at vinyl, which
is the H attached to a

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.967
carbon that's double bonded.

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:46.000
Now if we look at the radical we
see that we have a SOMO, so

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.867
there's the possibility for
interacting with something and

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:50.600
changing its energy.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.900
But notice that the HOMOs and
LUMOs that it might interact

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.200
with are pi and pi-star.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.733
And there's no special
stabilization because they're

00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:02.367
perpendicular to one
another, they're

00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:04.900
orthogonal, there's no overlap.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.667
So there's no reason that having
this double bond should

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:09.767
make that radical unusually
stable.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.900
And notice that, it, in fact,
is hard to break as if this

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.867
were unstable.

00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:20.733
But it's neither stable
or unstable, it's

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.900
just what it is.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.133
On the other hand, if we look at
the starting material where

00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:29.067
we have this C-H bond, notice
that as compared to these

00:13:29.067 --> 00:13:34.400
others, which are 100 plus or
minus 5, that this one is made

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.600
from an sp squared carbon,
right?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.600
So very good overlap.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.000
So in this case, it's that
the bond is unusual.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.733
The bond is unusually
strong, the

00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:46.433
radical is nothing special.

00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.700
It's very hard to break.

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:54.500
So it's hard, it's 111.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:58.967
The same thing is true in the
phenyl radical where, again,

00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:02.167
the C-H bond we're talking about
is attached to a double

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:04.067
bonded carbon.

00:14:04.067 --> 00:14:06.233
Here it's part of
a benzene ring.

00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:10.667
But again, the unusual energy
orbitals in the ring are

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:14.167
perpendicular, they don't
overlap with the singularly

00:14:14.167 --> 00:14:17.600
occupied orbital we're
talking about.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.533
Therefore, nothing
special here.

00:14:19.533 --> 00:14:23.067
But again, it's an sp squared
carbon to hydrogen bond, and

00:14:23.067 --> 00:14:27.367
again, it's unusually strong,
113 kilocalories per mole.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:30.467
So these are unusual because the
starting material has an

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:33.233
unusually strong bond.

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.133
Now let's look at these others,
allyl and benzyl where

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:40.433
it's an unusually easy
bond to break.

00:14:40.433 --> 00:14:44.300
Now we look at the allyl radical
where we've broken H

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.067
off this carbon, and now what's
different about that as

00:14:48.067 --> 00:14:51.367
compared to the ones above?

00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:53.667
We broke the H off, we
got a p orbital that

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:58.433
has the single occupancy.

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:01.900
Anybody got an idea about
whether it's going to be usual

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.133
or unusual?

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.867
Sebastian?

00:15:06.867 --> 00:15:08.000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.600
PROFESSOR: Pardon me?

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.567
STUDENT: It can mix
with the pi-star?

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:12.167
PROFESSOR: Now it can mix with
the pi-star because it's going

00:15:12.167 --> 00:15:15.667
in and out of the plane.

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:18.633
So now it overlaps with
the pi and pi-star.

00:15:18.633 --> 00:15:20.133
Now what's that going to do?

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:21.800
Well here's the singly
occupied

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.500
orbital, the red one here.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.233
Here's pi-star, vacant.

00:15:25.233 --> 00:15:26.367
They'll mix.

00:15:26.367 --> 00:15:28.267
That would suggest that
the single electron

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:30.267
would go down in energy.

00:15:30.267 --> 00:15:31.967
That would be good.

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:34.667
However, we should also think
about the fact that there's an

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:38.367
unusually high HOMO associated
with the blue orbitals there,

00:15:38.367 --> 00:15:39.967
the pi orbital.

00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:43.133
So we could consider
instead the pi.

00:15:43.133 --> 00:15:46.700
And now we see that that would
shift this electron up, but

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.433
these two electrons
would go down.

00:15:48.433 --> 00:15:52.900
Again you would win
more down than up.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.133
So this is a little
schizophrenic on the part of

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:56.633
the singly occupied
orbital.

00:15:56.633 --> 00:15:59.267
Does it move up or down?

00:15:59.267 --> 00:16:01.600
The answer is "No."

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.733
One of them pushes it down, the
other pushes it up, stays

00:16:04.733 --> 00:16:06.867
the same place it started.

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:12.567
But the others go up and down,
the ones that came from the pi

00:16:12.567 --> 00:16:13.833
and the pi-star.

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:17.667
So you get net stabilization due
to this pair of electrons

00:16:17.667 --> 00:16:18.333
going down.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:21.333
So we have this special
"allylic" it's called,

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:26.333
stabilization from mixing the
SOMO with the pi and pi-star

00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.200
orbitals adjacent
to one another.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.133
So this radical is
unusually stable.

00:16:31.133 --> 00:16:33.867
On the other hand, in the
starting material, the bond

00:16:33.867 --> 00:16:39.433
was just a regular old sp3 C-H
bond, nothing special there.

00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:42.933
So as compared to here where
the starting material was

00:16:42.933 --> 00:16:46.500
unusually strong, here the
product is unusually stable.

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:53.400
So that was easy to break,
89 kilocalories per mole.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.833
And the same is true for the
benzyl radical where the p

00:16:56.833 --> 00:17:00.300
orbital on the adjacent carbon,
again can overlap with

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:02.433
the pi system of the
benzene ring.

00:17:02.433 --> 00:17:05.267
So you get special stability
and it only takes 90

00:17:05.267 --> 00:17:07.467
kilocalories per mole.

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:13.000
So we can understand these
special cases of bond

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.267
strengths, of bond enthalpies.

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:21.833
Now, we spoke last semester
about the

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:24.100
halogenation of alkanes.

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:29.967
So we can use these bond
dissociation energies to do

00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:32.633
some calculations about the
possibility of doing

00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:34.500
halogenation of alkanes.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:38.900
So let's just take as an example
methane, some various

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:43.833
dihalogen molecules, and we can
trade partners, a double

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:46.667
displacement sort of reaction,
as they called it in the early

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:50.000
days, and make CH3
X and HX.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.067
So we break the red bonds and
form the green bonds.

00:17:54.067 --> 00:17:57.933
So we have a cost to pay in
breaking bonds, we have a

00:17:57.933 --> 00:18:01.000
return from making the bonds,
and we're going to see whether

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.500
we get a net profit from trying
to run this operation.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.900
So we're going to do it for
fluorine, chlorine, bromine

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.067
and iodine.

00:18:09.067 --> 00:18:11.700
Now, of course, in all those
cases the C-H bond is the

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.567
same, it's 105 kilocalories
per mole.

00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:19.833
Now, but the halogen-halogen
bonds are different.

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:28.333
It's fairly weak for fluorine,
strong for chlorine, but then

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:30.867
weaker again for bromine,
and back to

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:32.300
the start for diiodine.

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.300
What does that tell you that as
you go down the rows of the

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:43.867
periodic table, you don't get
some monotonic up or down in

00:18:43.867 --> 00:18:47.100
the bond strength, but
it goes up and down?

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.633
What do you infer from
that kind of thing

00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:49.900
when you get curve?

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:54.967
STUDENT: There must be two
factors.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:56.033
PROFESSOR: There must
be at least two

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:59.467
factors involved in this.

00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:03.667
And those factors are probably
the overlap of the sigma bond,

00:19:03.667 --> 00:19:06.300
which is best for
fluorine-fluorine, but the

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.100
interaction of unshared pairs
which is worst for fluorine.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.300
So you have two things
going on.

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.900
Anyhow, we can add those two
together to see what it's

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.833
going to cost us to break
those two bonds.

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:22.633
And there are the values,
they're in the range of 150

00:19:22.633 --> 00:19:24.500
kilocalories per mole.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.600
But then when we do the reaction
we're going to profit

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:31.600
by making the bonds on the
right, so that we have various

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:35.233
values for the carbon-X bond
that we got out of that table

00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:36.633
we just showed.

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:40.867
And for the H-X bond, and
there's the return we get.

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:44.200
Now are these going to be
favorable reactions?

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.533
Well, in the case of fluorine
it's wildly favorable.

00:19:48.533 --> 00:19:51.533
It's favorable by 109
kilocalories per mole.

00:19:55.567 --> 00:20:02.967
But it's only 19 kilocalories
per mole for chlorine, only 9

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:07.767
for bromine, and it's 12
kilocalories UPHILL in that

00:20:07.767 --> 00:20:09.400
case of iodine.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.200
So you're not going to make a
profit if you try to set up a

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.000
factory to convert methane
and iodine to

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.600
methyl iodide and HI.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.533
In fact, you'd want to run at
the opposite direction.

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:26.667
But the others, at least
overall, are favorable.

00:20:26.667 --> 00:20:30.033
So we know from equilibrium
now that for three of the

00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:33.700
halogens this reaction
should be favorable.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:35.567
And for one of them it should
be unfavorable.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.400
But how about the rate?

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.533
How fast will it be?

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:47.700
Now if this were the mechanism,
first you break two

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.200
bonds, then you change partners
and re-attach,

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.500
the activation energy for
getting up to the transition

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.700
state for this where both bonds
are broken is going to

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:03.800
be this cost. Right? So is
break-two-bonds-then-make-two a

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.100
plausible mechanism?

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.867
Could we get a rate that's
reasonable on

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:09.033
the basis of that?

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:12.200
If you know the activation
energy you have to get to, how

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.633
do you go about calculating
the rate?

00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:15.467
Debby?

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:17.433
STUDENT: 10 to the 13th.

00:21:17.433 --> 00:21:20.100
PROFESSOR: Right, it's 10 to
the thirteenth per second,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.067
times 10 to the--

00:21:21.067 --> 00:21:23.867
STUDENT: Negative 3/4th

00:21:23.867 --> 00:21:26.867
PROFESSOR: 10 to the minus
3/4 of that energy.

00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:29.000
So let's think about it
then in this case.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.367
Suppose we take one of these
that's about 140.

00:21:33.367 --> 00:21:37.067
So at room temperature, 300K,
which is where your

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:41.600
approximation works, the 3/4,
we find that it's 10 to the

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:45.200
thirteenth per second times
10 the minus 106

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.067
3/4 of one of these numbers.

00:21:48.067 --> 00:21:51.833
So it'll be 10 to the
minus 93 per second.

00:21:51.833 --> 00:21:54.433
That's a very unfavorable
number.

00:21:54.433 --> 00:21:55.833
So forget that.

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:59.333
There's no way a mechanism like
that could work at room

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:00.467
temperature.

00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:05.667
What might you be able to do
to realize such a reaction?

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:06.700
Yeah, Amy?

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:07.533
STUDENT: Heat it.

00:22:07.533 --> 00:22:08.700
PROFESSOR: Higher temperature.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.300
So suppose you go to
3,000K instead of 300K?

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:18.200
Now instead of 3/4 it's 3/40.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.700
So if we go to 3,000K,
then it's 10 to the thirteenth

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.333
times 10 to the minus
10.6, which would

00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:27.433
be 250 times a second. Right?

00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:30.700
So that would be accessible.

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.333
Except that there probably is
something else lthat could

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:38.100
happen when you're at that
very high temperature.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:43.967
So fundamentally this is not
a reasonable mechanism.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:47.567
And we already know a better
way to go about it from

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:51.467
looking at these potential
energy surfaces for

00:22:51.467 --> 00:22:55.200
transferring an atom between two
other atoms. Remember we

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.133
start with H plus H2, and then
we can move around on this

00:22:59.133 --> 00:23:03.133
surface and have, for collinear
three Hs, we can

00:23:03.133 --> 00:23:08.267
get the energy differences
between two of the Hs and the

00:23:08.267 --> 00:23:10.767
other two Hs.

00:23:10.767 --> 00:23:13.500
So there's the product we want
to go to where a hydrogen has

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.800
been transferred from the
right to the left.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.233
And one way to do it, the way
we've been talking about, is

00:23:19.233 --> 00:23:23.800
to go by way of three separate
atoms. Which means we go up

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:27.267
there, way up in energy, very
slow, and once we get there

00:23:27.267 --> 00:23:29.667
then zing, we go down.

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:33.400
But it's very hard to get
up to this plateau.

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.033
On the other hand, as we knew
from the marble, the way it

00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:40.267
actually works is to transfer a
hydrogen between two rather

00:23:40.267 --> 00:23:43.000
than to break a bond first
and then make a bond.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.033
So make it as you break it that
way and that's going to

00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:47.300
be much faster.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.433
So this kind of displacement
reaction is the way we want to

00:23:50.433 --> 00:23:55.167
do it-- to make a new bond
as we break the old one.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.967
That's how we're going to do
it, and we already talked

00:23:56.967 --> 00:23:58.233
about this last semester.

00:23:58.233 --> 00:24:01.033
First you take chlorine and
you break its bond.

00:24:01.033 --> 00:24:03.633
That's going to require
some energy.

00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:06.633
But once you have the free
radical, then you can transfer

00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:10.033
a hydrogen atom making a bond
as you break a bond.

00:24:10.033 --> 00:24:11.900
So going through that
pass rather than

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.867
over the big plateau.

00:24:13.867 --> 00:24:16.500
And now the product of that
is HCl, one of the

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.733
products you want.

00:24:17.733 --> 00:24:20.533
But the other one is another
free radical made without

00:24:20.533 --> 00:24:22.900
having to spontaneously
break a bond.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.533
And now it can react with Cl2
to give the other product we

00:24:26.533 --> 00:24:29.667
want and the chlorine atom,
and then we go back

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:31.933
to the beginning in this
free-radical chain, and this is

00:24:31.933 --> 00:24:33.600
what we talked about
last semester.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.133
Ok, another way of
writing the same thing

00:24:38.133 --> 00:24:40.567
is to say we could have the
starting materials here

00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:44.267
to the top left and bottom
right, the halogen and

00:24:44.267 --> 00:24:49.233
the alkane, and we could have
the X atom that we got somehow.

00:24:49.233 --> 00:24:53.200
It could be by heat breaking the
relatively weak bond, it could

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.533
be by light, it could be by some
chemical reaction that generates

00:24:57.533 --> 00:24:59.967
a free radical, but somehow we
get a radical.

00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:01.633
Then it could react
in a hydrogen

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:05.900
atom transfer to give one of the
products, the green XH here,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.233
and another radical, and it
could react with the halogen

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:12.667
to give the other product and go
back where we started.

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:16.867
So what we have is a cyclic
machine that just cranks round

00:25:16.867 --> 00:25:23.333
and round. It preserves the
radicalness of the situation.

00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:26.633
You don't have to break any new
bonds spontaneously--

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:28.800
only to get the first radical.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:33.800
We're going to talk about this
some more later on.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.900
But to look now at how we're
going to rearrange things--

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.467
if you want to have a mechanism
for a reasonable

00:25:40.467 --> 00:25:45.000
rate, what you're going to do is
trade two of these columns.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.533
Instead of breaking two and then
making two, we'll trade

00:25:48.533 --> 00:25:53.433
those two columns so that on the
left we make and break; on

00:25:53.433 --> 00:25:57.033
the right in Step 2
we make and break.

00:25:57.033 --> 00:25:59.867
So now when we look at how much
each of these takes,

00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:01.500
Step 1 now in the case of

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.433
fluorine is actually favorable.

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:08.133
Step 2 is wildly favorable
in the case of fluorine and

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.933
overall it's very favorable,
as we knew.

00:26:10.933 --> 00:26:14.700
But now you can see that these
others, although overall

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:18.767
favorable, one of the steps
is unfavorable, but not

00:26:18.767 --> 00:26:20.300
drastically unfavorable--

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.300
only 2 or 10 or 20 kilocalories
per mole.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.700
That kind of barrier
you could get over.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.733
You can't get over the
barriers of 50

00:26:29.733 --> 00:26:31.733
kilocalories or more.

00:26:31.733 --> 00:26:35.100
So now you have two steps, each
of them a very simple

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.067
make as you break
atom transfer.

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:41.933
And, of course, here the first
one is so high that you're not

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:44.633
going to be able to get over it,
and even if you could you

00:26:44.633 --> 00:26:47.433
wouldn't give the product, the
reaction would run backwards.

00:26:51.733 --> 00:26:58.233
So we know the energies of the
starting material and products

00:26:58.233 --> 00:27:01.533
for each of these steps, but
we don't really know the

00:27:01.533 --> 00:27:03.933
activation energy-- how much
you have to come up

00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:06.367
before you come down.

00:27:06.367 --> 00:27:08.667
And that's what we're going to
be starting to look at next

00:27:08.667 --> 00:27:13.100
lecture is how could we predict
the activation energy

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.567
for a simple one-step reaction
if we know how exothermic or

00:27:18.567 --> 00:27:20.033
endothermic it is.

00:27:23.067 --> 00:27:27.933
But even if we could predict the
rate of Step 1 or step 2,

00:27:27.933 --> 00:27:31.667
there's still a problem
because the overall process is

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.100
not just one step,
it's two steps.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.867
And how would we know the
overall rate if there are two

00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:38.500
reaction steps going on?

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.067
This is a little more
complicated.

00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:44.267
So we're going to take a little
digression now to learn

00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:49.100
to cope with complex reactions
that involve several steps.

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.167
So this is a digression
on reaction

00:27:51.167 --> 00:27:53.833
order and complex reaction.

00:27:53.833 --> 00:27:58.167
Now the reaction order is the
kinetic, the rate analog of

00:27:58.167 --> 00:28:01.233
the law of mass action that we
talked about at the end last

00:28:01.233 --> 00:28:03.933
time-- remember, it was just
statistical, how likely is it

00:28:03.933 --> 00:28:07.033
that there are going to be two
things next to one another?

00:28:07.033 --> 00:28:09.833
The same thing, getting next
to one another is the same

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:12.767
problem if things are going to
react with one another in

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:15.133
getting to the transition
state as well.

00:28:15.133 --> 00:28:17.733
So there's going to be a
dependence of rate on

00:28:17.733 --> 00:28:21.800
concentration, the same way that
equilibrium depends on

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.167
concentrations, as we
saw last semester.

00:28:25.167 --> 00:28:29.967
Moreover, this dependence of the
rate on concentration can

00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:33.533
give us information about what
kind of mechanism the reaction

00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:35.300
might be undergoing.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.033
So that's why we're particularly
interested in it.

00:28:38.033 --> 00:28:42.533
Now just to look at some simple
ideas first. The rate

00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:46.067
is how much per second, say, or
per minute or hour a day or

00:28:46.067 --> 00:28:48.867
whatever, how much per second.

00:28:48.867 --> 00:28:51.700
So we could have a faucet, we
turn it on and the water comes

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:54.867
out a certain rate per second.

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:56.567
Now what would happen if
you had two faucets?

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.867
Well, if things were simple
the rate would double.

00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:06.700
You know, if you think carefully
about it, it won't

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.833
quite do that because there
might be a restriction in how

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:11.433
much water can get to
the two faucets.

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:13.567
But in a simple point of view
if you double the number of

00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:16.133
faucets, you double the rate.

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:18.567
There's another way of doubling
the rate, which is to

00:29:18.567 --> 00:29:23.567
use a bigger faucet, one that's
twice as big, twice the

00:29:23.567 --> 00:29:26.500
cross-sectional area.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.533
Now in chemistry we can look at
how many moles or molecules

00:29:31.533 --> 00:29:33.600
we get per second.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:38.833
And if we have one beaker and
then have another beaker, or a

00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:43.567
single beaker with twice the
volume, we double the rate.

00:29:43.567 --> 00:29:44.900
So that will double the rate.

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.700
But chemists are clever.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:50.500
They can not only change the
volume, they can also change

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:53.833
the concentration in the same
volume, and that's the

00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:56.967
question we have. Obviously
you'd expect it to get faster

00:29:56.967 --> 00:30:00.400
if you have more stuff,
but how much faster?

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.533
Will it double?

00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:05.567
So this has to do with what
are called rate laws.

00:30:05.567 --> 00:30:10.800
What that exponent is going to
be that says if you double the

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.867
concentration of a reagent, how
much will the rate change,

00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:17.467
the number of molecules
you get per second?

00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:23.500
So the rate is the increase
in product with time.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.867
Then there's a rate law that's
some constant times the

00:30:26.867 --> 00:30:29.400
concentration of something.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.633
And maybe several
concentrations, but that

00:30:31.633 --> 00:30:33.367
question mark is
the exponent--

00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:35.333
what power do we raise it to?

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:39.000
That's what we mean in talking
about the kinetic order.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.567
If it's to the zeroth power,
it's a zeroth order; first

00:30:42.567 --> 00:30:46.967
power, first order; second
power, second order and so on.

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:51.100
But those exponents will have to
do with what the mechanism

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.767
of the reaction is.

00:30:52.767 --> 00:30:57.333
So the only way to discover
it is by experiment.

00:30:57.333 --> 00:31:00.433
So let's first look at some
simple one-step reactions, and

00:31:00.433 --> 00:31:03.900
then we're going to look at
complicated reactions.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.233
So in a simple 
one-step  reaction you

00:31:06.233 --> 00:31:09.233
could have zero order--

00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:11.067
this sounds weird, doesn't it?

00:31:11.067 --> 00:31:14.833
That the rate doesn't depend on
how much material you have.

00:31:14.833 --> 00:31:16.700
You double the amount of
material, double the

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.967
concentration of material and
it doesn't change the rate.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.933
How can that be?

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:27.600
Well here's a picture that
helps illustrate it for

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.100
sheep getting from 
one field to the other.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:35.300
Now in this situation, if the
shepherd had more sheep, would

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.533
the rate increase?

00:31:38.933 --> 00:31:41.367
Would you get sheep from one
field to the other faster?

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:44.267
No, they're going as fast as
they can no matter how many

00:31:44.267 --> 00:31:47.700
sheep are lined up.

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.633
Because it's saturated.

00:31:49.633 --> 00:31:52.233
It can't go any faster
because of how wide

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:53.500
he's opening the gate.

00:31:55.933 --> 00:31:59.400
So there are real cases like
this in chemistry where you

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.400
have a catalyst that's involved
in converting the

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.067
starting material
to the product.

00:32:05.067 --> 00:32:09.233
When the catalyst is working
as fast as it possibly can,

00:32:09.233 --> 00:32:11.167
increasing the starting material
isn't going to

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:13.900
increase the rate of the
reaction anymore.

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:16.933
The gate can't open any wider.

00:32:16.933 --> 00:32:18.700
And that's often the
case with enzymes.

00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:26.633
So you have the substrate, the
starting material, which

00:32:26.633 --> 00:32:28.867
interacts with the catalyst
in order to get a product.

00:32:28.867 --> 00:32:32.033
But if the catalyst is rate
limiting, if it's saturated,

00:32:32.033 --> 00:32:33.667
you can't go any faster.

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:35.900
So the rate then is proportional
to how much

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.300
catalyst you have, of course.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.200
If you doubled the amount
of catalyst under those

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:42.000
situations you'd double
the rate.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
But the substrate is raised to
the zero power, it doesn't

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.567
make any difference.

00:32:47.567 --> 00:32:52.267
So the rate is actually just
proportional to the catalyst,

00:32:52.267 --> 00:32:56.367
independent of the substrate.

00:32:56.367 --> 00:33:02.400
But if doing the experiment you
didn't realize that there

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.067
was a catalyst in there doing
it, you just thought it was

00:33:05.067 --> 00:33:11.067
happening spontaneously, then
you would say it's zero order.

00:33:11.067 --> 00:33:13.800
So that's a zero order reaction,
zero order kinetics.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:22.433
But that works only when the
sheep are really crowded here.

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.900
If the sheep were all over the
fields and some coming

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.133
through, if the concentration
were lower, then having more

00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:31.033
sheep would allow them to
get through faster.

00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:35.900
You're not saturating the
catalyst. But it becomes first

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.600
order in substrate when you have
very low concentration of

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.900
substrate, but at some higher
concentration it

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:43.533
becomes zero order.

00:33:43.533 --> 00:33:45.833
So it's always, in principle,
possible to lower the

00:33:45.833 --> 00:33:49.200
concentration until it
becomes first order.

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.833
But, in fact, under many
conditions it would be

00:33:51.833 --> 00:33:54.000
zero order.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.300
So that's an example
of zero order.

00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:02.333
Now, first-order says the rate
is proportional to the first

00:34:02.333 --> 00:34:05.467
power of the amount of
reagent you're using.

00:34:05.467 --> 00:34:07.633
And that's, of course, very
reasonable-- it's like the

00:34:07.633 --> 00:34:11.700
water coming through the taps
or something like that.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.800
Now if you have first order
kinetics, the amount of

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.733
product you get in time
looks like this.

00:34:18.733 --> 00:34:23.700
It's an exponential approach
to the 100%.

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:26.433
Or this particular one
is drawn with a

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:27.900
certain rate constant.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.533
If the rate constant
were faster it

00:34:29.533 --> 00:34:31.200
would rise more quickly.

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.500
If the rate constant were
lower it would rise more

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.467
slowly, but always it would
go, in this case, to 100%.

00:34:38.467 --> 00:34:40.933
You could, instead of monitoring
the product, you

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.500
could look at the disappearance
of starting

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.967
material, which is then an
exponential decay, just the

00:34:44.967 --> 00:34:46.200
same thing upside-down.

00:34:48.733 --> 00:34:51.300
So exponential decay
means you have a

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.233
constant, so-called half-life.

00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:58.000
Now I chose 0.69 here
for a reason.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.667
It's because the half-life, the
time it takes for half the

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:07.300
material to go away, is 0.69
divided by whatever k is.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:13.633
So if I chose k to be 0.69,
the half-life is 1.

00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:20.500
So after 1 second, half of
the material remains.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.767
After another 1 second,
a quarter, then an eighth, then

00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:27.800
a sixteenth and so on.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.600
And that's the necessary--

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.833
you can prove it easily
by mathematics for

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:35.167
a first-order reaction.

00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:36.667
There is a repeating
half-life.

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:43.300
Now, suppose you have a more
complex situation where it's

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:46.633
first-order kinetics but
it's reversible.

00:35:46.633 --> 00:35:49.467
So the starting material at a
certain rate goes to product,

00:35:49.467 --> 00:35:52.500
but the product can also come
back to starting material,

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:55.967
suppose at a much lower rate.

00:35:55.967 --> 00:36:00.267
So once you reach equilibrium
the two rates balance so

00:36:00.267 --> 00:36:03.333
things cease changing.

00:36:03.333 --> 00:36:06.033
In fact, you know, in the
nineteenth century,

00:36:06.033 --> 00:36:12.367
equilibrium situations were
initially discussed not as

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:15.067
equilibria, but as
balanced rates.

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:20.600
So at any rate, they're
the same thing.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.167
So whatever k1 is times the
concentration of starting

00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:26.667
material will be equal
to whatever k-1 is times the

00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:30.000
concentration of product.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.100
Or we could divide through
by starting material

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.333
here and k1 over here.

00:36:35.333 --> 00:36:40.200
So k1 over k-1 is the
equilibrium constant.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.400
So now the product doesn't go
to 100% nor the starting

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.467
material to zero.

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:52.800
But if you start with all
starting material, you get

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:57.467
these exponential behaviors,
it's still exponential.

00:36:57.467 --> 00:37:00.133
That's what's interesting.

00:37:00.133 --> 00:37:02.900
But it doesn't approach zero.

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:06.733
So here, after 1 second where
with that rate constant you

00:37:06.733 --> 00:37:11.333
would have fallen to half, you
don't fall quite to half,

00:37:11.333 --> 00:37:13.100
because some stuff
is coming back.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.100
But if you go to the ultimate
goal of equilibrium

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:24.333
here, then you find--

00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:27.067
notice the equilibrium constant
is 3, I chose that to

00:37:27.067 --> 00:37:28.133
be a third of that.

00:37:28.133 --> 00:37:34.500
So there's one quarter of the
red material and three

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.667
quarters of the blue material
at equilibrium.

00:37:37.667 --> 00:37:43.100
But if we draw this at 25%, the
value that the starting

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.633
material actually approaches
asymptotically, exponentially,

00:37:47.633 --> 00:37:51.867
we find now there is a
repeating half-life--

00:37:51.867 --> 00:37:54.533
this is truly an exponential.

00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:58.233
But the interesting thing is
that it's an exponential decay

00:37:58.233 --> 00:38:04.667
to the equilibrium mixture,
but the half-life is 0.69

00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:08.000
divided by the SUM of the
two rate constants.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.367
Again, this is easy to
demonstrate using calculus,

00:38:11.367 --> 00:38:14.400
but it's just sort of cute
that you add forward and

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.600
reverse rate constants together
to get how rapidly it

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.867
approaches equilibrium.

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:25.333
So they're first-order
reactions, both just one way

00:38:25.333 --> 00:38:27.133
and reversible.

00:38:27.133 --> 00:38:29.600
Now, a second-order reaction
is proportional to

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.000
the square of [A].

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.067
That's obviously true if two
A's have to get together in

00:38:34.067 --> 00:38:38.700
order to reach the
transition state.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.033
But it could also be
second-order if you have an A

00:38:42.033 --> 00:38:45.067
interacting with a B. In that
case you say it's first order

00:38:45.067 --> 00:38:48.867
in A and first-order in B and
second-order overall.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:57.100
But what if B is effectively
constant?

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:02.167
So as time goes on, A is
decreasing but B is not

00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:03.833
decreasing.

00:39:03.833 --> 00:39:06.433
How could that possibly
be the case?

00:39:06.433 --> 00:39:09.100
How could you have a reaction
where B doesn't decrease?

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:14.833
STUDENT: B is a catalyst.

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:17.200
PROFESSOR: Ah, if B
were a catalyst,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.167
it doesn't get consumed.

00:39:18.167 --> 00:39:18.633
That's one way.

00:39:18.633 --> 00:39:26.200
Another way is that the B is in
gross excess compared to A.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.633
So even though A consumes a
B, it doesn't change its

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:32.500
concentration appreciably,
because the concentration is

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.733
so large compared to that of A.
So if [B] is much greater

00:39:35.733 --> 00:39:37.000
than [A] you get that.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.667
And in that situation you say
that you can neglect [B]

00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:46.733
by incorporating
it into the k.

00:39:46.733 --> 00:39:49.667
Whatever [B] is, it's
not changing.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:52.233
For all you know when you're
doing the experiment you might

00:39:52.233 --> 00:39:54.700
not even though there's a
catalyst there, but it's there

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:56.933
in always the same amount,
you always get

00:39:56.933 --> 00:39:57.933
the same rate constant.

00:39:57.933 --> 00:40:00.533
And in a situation like
that you say it's

00:40:00.533 --> 00:40:02.533
pseudo first order.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:05.467
It behaves as if it's first
order, even though it really

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:08.333
depends on something
else as well.

00:40:08.333 --> 00:40:12.367
And so a second-order process
could be a pseudo first order

00:40:12.367 --> 00:40:13.967
rate constant.

00:40:13.967 --> 00:40:18.400
For example, suppose
B were the solvent.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.233
Then it appears that it's a
first-order reaction, even

00:40:21.233 --> 00:40:24.000
though it turned out that the
solvent had to react with the

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.700
thing in order to do it.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.133
So that's pseudo first order.

00:40:29.133 --> 00:40:32.400
Now, if you have a second-order
reaction compared to a

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.067
first-order reaction, that
is a regular second-order

00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:38.300
reaction where two molecules
of A have to get together,

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.733
what you find is that a
first-order reaction

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:42.233
goes like this.

00:40:42.233 --> 00:40:45.900
But the second order starts
faster and ends slower.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.800
So it's no longer exponential.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.767
Obviously it's decreasing but
not with a half-life, not

00:40:50.767 --> 00:40:53.500
exponentially, not a repeating
half-life because it gets

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:55.700
slower as it goes along because
it depends on the

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.867
square of the concentration.

00:40:57.867 --> 00:40:59.100
So it slows faster.

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.200
It's not exponential.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.800
There is no constant
half-life.

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.933
So that's how you
would know that

00:41:02.933 --> 00:41:04.067
something is second order.

00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:07.133
You measure how much in the
first increment of time, the

00:41:07.133 --> 00:41:10.767
second increment, and they're
not exponential.

00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:14.600
Now we'll get on to complex
reactions and the idea of the

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.100
rate-limiting step.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.067
So suppose that you go to an
intermediate and then it goes

00:41:21.067 --> 00:41:21.700
to product.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.933
But suppose the transition state
energies are like this.

00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:29.033
So it's very slow to get
to the intermediate.

00:41:29.033 --> 00:41:31.000
But once you're at the
intermediate it rapidly goes

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.300
to product.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.900
Now this reactive intermediate
never builds up, you never

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:40.900
have an appreciable amount of
it, because even if it were at

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:44.400
equilibrium with this there's
very little of it with a big

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.833
energy difference here.

00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:47.300
So you might not even
know that the

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.633
intermediate is there.

00:41:49.633 --> 00:41:52.200
You get there and it immediately
goes to product.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:58.633
In that case, who cares really
about what rate this is, as

00:41:58.633 --> 00:42:02.133
long as it's fast? The rate at
which you get product is the

00:42:02.133 --> 00:42:03.800
rate at which you get this.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.167
It never builds up.

00:42:05.167 --> 00:42:07.300
Every time you get it, it goes
immediately to product, or

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.433
very quickly.

00:42:08.433 --> 00:42:11.467
So this first step then, even
though it's a two-step

00:42:11.467 --> 00:42:14.900
reaction, the first step is
the one whose rate makes a

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.900
difference.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.767
If you double the rate of the
first step then you'll double

00:42:18.767 --> 00:42:22.433
the overall rate of the
reaction, because the second

00:42:22.433 --> 00:42:23.700
step doesn't make
any difference.

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:26.867
So that's called the
rate-limiting step.

00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:29.700
On the other hand, suppose that
that first reaction is

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.800
fast and the second
one is slow.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.467
So you have a rapid
pre-equilibrium formed between

00:42:36.467 --> 00:42:39.733
these two-- again, not very
much of the intermediate.

00:42:39.733 --> 00:42:42.500
But it reaches an equilibrium
concentration compared to

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:47.033
this, or almost, and then slowly
it goes to product.

00:42:47.033 --> 00:42:50.233
Now two things that are in
equilibrium with the same

00:42:50.233 --> 00:42:54.100
thing are in equilibrium
with each other.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.067
So to the extent that that
intermediate is in equilibrium

00:42:57.067 --> 00:43:00.733
with the starting material, and
we treat the rate of going

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:05.667
over here as an equilibrium
between the intermediate and

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.367
this transition state, we could
also pretend that the

00:43:10.367 --> 00:43:12.867
transition state is in
equilibrium with the starting

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:15.867
material, since they're both
in equilibrium with the

00:43:15.867 --> 00:43:18.033
intermediate.

00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:20.767
So now, who cares that there's
an intermediate, that there's

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:21.900
a first step.

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:25.133
We can calculate the rate just
on the basis of getting how

00:43:25.133 --> 00:43:28.433
much of this transition state
there is by assuming it's in

00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:29.800
equilibrium with that
starting material.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:38.967
So now the second step or the
second transition state is

00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:39.700
rate-limiting.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.967
All we have to know is how high
it is compared to the

00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:43.000
starting material.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.967
We don't care about
the intermediate.

00:43:44.967 --> 00:43:47.667
So you can have one step
or the other step be

00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:50.367
rate-limiting.

00:43:50.367 --> 00:43:54.267
Or if they're not drastically
different, both of them could

00:43:54.267 --> 00:43:55.867
affect the rate.

00:43:55.867 --> 00:43:59.167
Many cases one or the other
is rate-limiting.

00:43:59.167 --> 00:44:02.433
But if you want to see how it
works out in a complicated

00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:04.633
case, where you have a starting
material that can go

00:44:04.633 --> 00:44:07.533
reversibly to the intermediate,
and then the

00:44:07.533 --> 00:44:08.967
intermediate goes to
product all with

00:44:08.967 --> 00:44:11.633
certain rate constants,

00:44:11.633 --> 00:44:14.267
on the website you can get an
Excel program, which is a

00:44:14.267 --> 00:44:15.633
crummy Excel program.

00:44:15.633 --> 00:44:18.033
I'm sorry, it executes
very slowly.

00:44:18.033 --> 00:44:21.100
You can change the parameters to
make it go a little faster.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:24.100
But you can put in what energy
you want for the starting

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.800
material, the intermediate and
the product; and what energy

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:31.167
you want for the transition
states, one and two, and see

00:44:31.167 --> 00:44:34.700
how the overall rate compares
with what you would have

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.167
calculated if it had been just
the first step that you had to

00:44:38.167 --> 00:44:41.233
get over, or just the second
step that you had to get over.

00:44:41.233 --> 00:44:44.900
In this particular case where
each of these is about between

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:47.533
a kilocalorie and a kilocalorie
and a half, the

00:44:47.533 --> 00:44:49.900
difference between those two
and the difference between

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.833
these two, you get this.

00:44:53.833 --> 00:44:57.033
So this is the actual rate.

00:44:57.033 --> 00:44:58.900
Notice the amount of
starting material

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.867
immediately falls quickly--

00:45:00.867 --> 00:45:02.733
that's when you're establishing
equilibrium

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:03.833
between these two.

00:45:03.833 --> 00:45:05.900
So starting material is
going to intermediate.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.433
And then slowly it
goes away as the

00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:11.967
intermediate goes to product.

00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:13.600
Here is the intermediate.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.133
It immediately builds up to some
concentration and then it

00:45:17.133 --> 00:45:18.633
changes very slowly.

00:45:18.633 --> 00:45:23.100
It stays fairly stable for
any short period of time.

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:31.333
Now, if you didn't have the
first barrier and had only the

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:33.800
second one, it was a
one-step reaction.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.467
This is what you would
have calculated

00:45:35.467 --> 00:45:36.900
for those same energies.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:37.967
So not too bad.

00:45:37.967 --> 00:45:42.033
So, in fact, the second
transition state is pretty

00:45:42.033 --> 00:45:45.700
much rate-limiting-- you get
pretty much the same result.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.833
On the other end, if transition
state two weren't

00:45:48.833 --> 00:45:51.733
there and you only had to get
over transition state one,

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:54.233
then you'd have that blue
one there, if it

00:45:54.233 --> 00:45:55.600
were the sole barrier.

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.933
So very far from that.

00:45:56.933 --> 00:46:01.100
But even in this situation,
you don't make a very big

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.100
mistake if you just ignored
the intermediate and

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.233
the first transition state, 
and said it

00:46:07.233 --> 00:46:09.167
was only transition state two.

00:46:09.167 --> 00:46:11.467
It's rate limiting.

00:46:11.467 --> 00:46:14.933
And if you fiddle with this
you'll find that if you start

00:46:14.933 --> 00:46:18.500
changing these differences very
much, then one of them or

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.767
the other one becomes clearly
rate-limiting--

00:46:20.767 --> 00:46:24.200
you get much better agreement.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.233
Now, I said that this was
between a kilocalorie and a

00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:31.567
kilocalorie and a half, 3/4 of
that is about one, so the

00:46:31.567 --> 00:46:33.967
equilibrium ratio
is about 10--

00:46:33.967 --> 00:46:37.300
or actually, I said 9 here,
9 times as much starting

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.000
material as intermediate.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So once the intermediate reaches
its steady sort of

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.767
equilibrium relationship with
the starting material, this

00:46:47.767 --> 00:46:52.233
very quick rise here, once you
get there, then there's 9

00:46:52.233 --> 00:46:54.467
times as much starting material
as there is in

00:46:54.467 --> 00:46:55.233
intermediate.

00:46:55.233 --> 00:46:59.567
That's 9 times as
much as this.

00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:02.700
And that persists then,
that ratio.

00:47:02.700 --> 00:47:05.333
When you get to here it's 9
times as much of one or the

00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:08.633
other and so on.

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:12.267
Now this is also a factor
of 10 between this.

00:47:12.267 --> 00:47:15.300
But this has to do with
rates, remember.

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:18.500
So this is how fast the
intermediate goes back to

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.033
starting material is 10 times
faster than how fast it goes

00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:28.133
to product because of those
differences in the delta H of

00:47:28.133 --> 00:47:29.367
activation.

00:47:31.167 --> 00:47:34.767
And what that means is that once
the intermediate reaches

00:47:34.767 --> 00:47:38.167
its steady state, its
equilibrium relationship with

00:47:38.167 --> 00:47:43.567
the starting material, it yields
product 1/10 as fast as

00:47:43.567 --> 00:47:44.800
it is formed.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.167
So it forms very rapidly,
you can see that here.

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:52.967
But now individual molecules are
still being formed just as

00:47:52.967 --> 00:47:56.467
rapidly, or almost as rapidly,
but they're going away just as

00:47:56.467 --> 00:47:59.100
rapidly as they're formed.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.133
Every one that's formed at a
certain rate goes back to

00:48:03.133 --> 00:48:06.933
starting material 10
times for every

00:48:06.933 --> 00:48:09.567
time it goes to product--

00:48:09.567 --> 00:48:12.267
9 times for every time
it goes to product.

00:48:12.267 --> 00:48:15.733
So 1/10 of the time it
goes on to product.

00:48:15.733 --> 00:48:19.633
So now the rate of going from
starting material to product

00:48:19.633 --> 00:48:25.167
is however fast it goes over
the first one times 1/10,

00:48:25.167 --> 00:48:27.200
because it's not changing.

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.533
It's reached the so-called
steady state.

00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:32.367
It's changing very slowly.

00:48:32.367 --> 00:48:36.700
Individual molecules are
going very rapidly.

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:39.267
So the rate of an individual
molecule to go from starting

00:48:39.267 --> 00:48:42.733
material to product is how fast
it goes to intermediate

00:48:42.733 --> 00:48:46.233
times 1/10.

00:48:46.233 --> 00:48:49.667
So that's a sequential 
reaction -- the idea of the

00:48:49.667 --> 00:48:51.100
rate-limiting step.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:55.133
Now a really interesting concept
is fractional order.

00:48:55.133 --> 00:48:57.967
But I see that we've reached the
time now, so we'll have to

00:48:57.967 --> 00:49:00.900
wait for fractional order
until the next lecture.

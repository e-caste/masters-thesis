00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.678
Prof: Miguel de
Cervantes died in Madrid on

00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:11.380
April 23rd, 1616.
 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.818
Remember that,
famously, Shakespeare died on

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.683
the same date;
not the same day,

00:00:18.683 --> 00:00:22.966
because England and Spain were
following different calendars,

00:00:22.966 --> 00:00:25.750
the difference of two or three
days.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.858
In the last five years of his
life Cervantes saw published

00:00:31.858 --> 00:00:38.405
The Exemplary Novels,
in 1613, The Voyage to

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:42.975
Parnassus,
which is a long poem of

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:50.393
essentially literary criticism,
where he reviews the writers of

00:00:50.393 --> 00:00:52.120
the appeared.
 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.310
That appeared in 1614.
 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.910
Part II of the Quixote
appeared in 1615,

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.349
and also, in that year,
his volume of theater,

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:10.156
called Eight Plays and Eight
New Interludes Never before

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.760
Performed.
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.930
In 1617 The Trials of
Persiles y Sigismunda was

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.370
published posthumously.
 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.777
Those plays he was able to
publish because of his newly

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:29.464
acquired fame,
and also because they had not

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:33.170
been very successful on the
stage,

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.879
except for the interludes.
 

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:40.810
Let me repeat a quotation from
the Casebook,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.069
specifically from the
biographical essay by Manual

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:49.069
Durán that opens the
Casebook.

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.754
This is a quote that I have
read before, but I want to

00:01:52.754 --> 00:01:55.930
repeat it;
it is a quote that also has

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.608
embedded a statement by
Ángel del Río,

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:06.450
which I think you may remember
his name in any case--

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:17.741
Ángel del Río--
that I think are appropriate as

00:02:17.741 --> 00:02:23.330
we wind up our course.
 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.817
But before I read you that
quote, let me read you the

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:33.250
following, also by Durán,
quote:

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.610
"Cervantes died in Madrid
on April 23rd,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:44.280
1616 at peace with himself and
with the world,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.250
having received the last
sacraments,

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.628
and was buried in the convent
of the Trinitarian Nuns.

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:53.277
He died without bitterness or
regrets since he had been fully

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.645
conscious of his merit,
indeed of his genius,

00:02:56.645 --> 00:03:01.408
and was aware that his literary
creations would endure.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:03.838
A writer cannot hope for a
greater source of

00:03:03.838 --> 00:03:04.968
consolation."
 

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:09.320
Later, constructions and
reconstructions of that building

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.973
by the way led to the
disappearance of Cervantes

00:03:12.973 --> 00:03:13.750
bones.
 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.889
So we don't have Cervantes'
relics, his bones are lost.

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:23.753
I have been insisting on
Cervantes' knowledge of Don

00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:28.138
Quixote's belonging--
awareness of Don Quixote's

00:03:28.138 --> 00:03:32.015
belonging to the gallery of
great literary figures from the

00:03:32.015 --> 00:03:33.220
classical past.
 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.590
Most recently,
when, in the last lecture,

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.280
I spoke about that scene in the
last inn where they lodge,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.538
and there are some wall
hangings with the figures of

00:03:46.538 --> 00:03:52.036
Helen of Troy and Dido,
and Sancho makes the quip that

00:03:52.036 --> 00:03:56.250
there will be images of Don
Quixote,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.883
of themselves,
of Don Quixote and Sancho all

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:02.606
everywhere in the future,
and I underline that that is a

00:04:02.606 --> 00:04:04.949
bet that Sancho has certainly
won.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:11.418
Now, let me go to that longer
quote by Durán and del

00:04:11.418 --> 00:04:14.539
Río,
who was--Ángel del

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:18.223
Río was the author of an
excellent history of Spanish

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:20.459
literature,
and as I said,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.009
he taught for many years at
Columbia University;

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.692
he was a Spaniard:
"Objectively,

00:04:28.692 --> 00:04:32.369
[says Durán]
Cervantes' life was not a

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:33.790
success story.
 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.944
He was seldom in full control,
he was too poor,

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:42.100
for many years he lacked public
recognition.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.329
Yet, as Ángel del
Río points out,

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:51.043
â€˜there is no reason to
lament [I'm quoting now the

00:04:51.043 --> 00:04:55.670
Ángel del Río
quote within Durán's

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.670
quote]
Cervantes' misfortunes,

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.990
nor the mediocrity of his daily
life.'

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:06.649
He could thus through an
experience,

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:10.940
which is seldom obtained when
the writer is successful and

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.889
wealthy,
he could know,

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.528
observe, and feel the beat of
Spanish life in its greatness

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:21.601
and in its poverty,
in its heroic fantasy and in

00:05:21.601 --> 00:05:24.949
the sad reality of an imminent
decadence.

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:29.774
He was to leave in his books
the most faithful image of this

00:05:29.774 --> 00:05:32.000
life,
reflected in multiple

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.817
perspectives with bitter sweet
irony and penetrating

00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:36.940
humor."
 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.754
The allusion to decadence here
is that, for many years,

00:05:41.754 --> 00:05:46.571
in the twentieth century
scholars studied the decadence

00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:48.889
of the Spanish empire.
 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.709
Remember that quote that I
brought,

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.040
and you must have read as you
read Elliot,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.382
from Elliot,
about Cervantes straddling

00:05:56.382 --> 00:05:58.850
those two moments of Spanish
history,

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.689
one of great triumph,
and then the beginnings of the

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:07.028
decline.
 

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:13.915
Now, Cervantes never attained
in his time the recognition of

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:18.819
Lope de Vega,
that writer I've mentioned so

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.569
many times.
 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.000
Lope de Vega,
whom Cervantes criticized and

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.850
admired at the same time.
 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:33.853
But Cervantes was a greater
writer than Lope,

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:39.040
and history has confirmed this
fact.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.593
Though Lope deserves a place in
the western canon,

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:50.259
he should not be at the same
level as Cervantes.

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:55.610
I say that because Lope is
generally not very well known in

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.350
the English-speaking world,
and he's sort of--I don't think

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.781
he even appears in my good
friend Harold Bloom's The

00:07:03.781 --> 00:07:08.326
Western Canon,
but that is not Lope's fault,

00:07:08.326 --> 00:07:10.930
that is Harold's fault.
 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:18.466
Lope never created the figure
of universal appeal like Don

00:07:18.466 --> 00:07:19.790
Quixote.
 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.439
Even if he wrote hundreds of
plays,

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:28.802
perhaps a thousand plays,
many among those plays are

00:07:28.802 --> 00:07:31.709
masterpieces:
Fuenteovejuna,

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:33.800
El caballero de Olmedo,
and so forth.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.959
They're masterpieces in their
own right, and Lope created

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.889
thousands of characters.
 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:42.470
This is all true.
 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.379
But he was not on the level of
Cervantes.

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:49.153
Ironically, though,
of course, in the period,

00:07:49.153 --> 00:07:51.360
Lope was tremendously
successful.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.574
His story is really a success
story: he was rich,

00:07:56.574 --> 00:08:01.572
he had a great following,
and even his name was

00:08:01.572 --> 00:08:04.939
synonymous with being good.
 

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.322
If you said,
it's "de Lope"

00:08:06.322 --> 00:08:07.629
it means that something is
good;

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:09.750
so that's how successful he was.
 

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:17.166
He just lorded over the Spanish
literary landscape in the early

00:08:17.166 --> 00:08:19.800
seventeenth century.
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.567
He fought in the Spanish
"Armada,"

00:08:22.567 --> 00:08:24.889
he had many women,
mistresses, wives,

00:08:24.889 --> 00:08:28.473
ten or fifteen children,
some of them legitimate,

00:08:28.473 --> 00:08:32.840
and at the end of his life he
became a priest,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.523
impregnated one of his
mistresses...

00:08:35.523 --> 00:08:38.360
Really a life really worth a
movie.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:43.191
In the meantime,
Cervantes was chugging along in

00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:45.495
Madrid,
within blocks of each other in

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:49.628
Madrid,
but he was creating a work that

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:52.529
was superior to Lope's.
 

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:58.490
Now, the question to ask,
as we draw a balance at the end

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.246
of the course,
is if Cervantes would have

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:06.217
deserved such recognition if he
had not written the

00:09:06.217 --> 00:09:09.889
Quixote but everything else
that he wrote.

00:09:09.889 --> 00:09:16.711
Would we have such high regard
for Cervantes if he had only

00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.971
published the rest of his work,
some of which I mentioned when

00:09:21.971 --> 00:09:24.623
I was listing the books that he
published towards the end of his

00:09:24.623 --> 00:09:24.960
life?
 

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.389
The answer has to be no,
the answer has to be no;

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:33.220
not by far, though.
 

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.500
He would have been acknowledged
as an important writer of short

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.230
novels on the basis of The
Exemplary Novels,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:45.178
Novelas ejemplares--I'll
talk about that later.

00:09:45.178 --> 00:09:49.753
He was also the author of a
mediocre pastoral romance,

00:09:49.753 --> 00:09:51.220
Galatea.
 

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.889
Remember, that he mentions it
in the--

00:09:53.889 --> 00:09:57.960
he has the characters mention
it in the scrutiny of the books,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:00.596
and he himself has some
critical things to say about

00:10:00.596 --> 00:10:03.325
that pastoral romance,
and still towards the end of

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:05.291
his life,
in the very last year,

00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:08.349
he was still thinking of
writing a second part of

00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:11.673
Galatea,
but it was a mediocre work with

00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:15.629
flashes of brilliance that
announced the Quixote,

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:17.389
but that are important because
of that,

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:20.700
not in themselves.
 

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:25.860
He was also the author of that
very uneven and very ambitious

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:30.245
Byzantine romance called The
Trials of Persiles y

00:10:30.245 --> 00:10:31.879
Sigismunda.
 

00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:35.908
I put this on the board several
times, so I don't have to do it

00:10:35.908 --> 00:10:36.428
again.
 

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:40.625
This is a very odd work,
as Byzantine romances tend to

00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.806
be,
and Cervantes thought,

00:10:42.806 --> 00:10:47.227
he was deluded into thinking
that this was going to be the

00:10:47.227 --> 00:10:50.879
culmination of his work,
his best work.

00:10:50.879 --> 00:10:53.110
Well, he was wrong.
 

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.529
Authors are often wrong about
the worth of what they write,

00:10:56.529 --> 00:10:58.889
and he certainly was wrong
about this.

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:05.217
The book is missing most of the
qualities that we admire in

00:11:05.217 --> 00:11:09.250
the Quixote;
it's a very long book.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:14.851
It lacks a central figure as
compelling as the mad knight,

00:11:14.851 --> 00:11:19.961
except for some episodes in
Spain that have sort of a

00:11:19.961 --> 00:11:24.437
realistic cast;
the geography is strange and

00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:28.359
abstract;
it begins in the snow and

00:11:28.359 --> 00:11:34.934
icebound regions of the North
Pole and finishes in Rome,

00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.490
of course.
 

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:42.825
The dialogues are stilted;
they're not like the dialogues

00:11:42.825 --> 00:11:46.490
in the Quixote,
where Sancho speaks in his very

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:51.009
folksy way;
and it is a very digressive

00:11:51.009 --> 00:11:51.928
novel.
 

00:11:51.928 --> 00:11:55.515
It has, again,
because Cervantes was the

00:11:55.515 --> 00:12:00.666
author of the Quixote,
some moments that we see as

00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:05.080
being brilliant,
and some odd things that...

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.432
For instance,
the characters carry around

00:12:07.432 --> 00:12:08.791
banner,
like painting,

00:12:08.791 --> 00:12:12.038
depicting their adventures,
so that whenever somebody asks

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:15.914
them where they have been,
they just unfurl this banner

00:12:15.914 --> 00:12:19.230
and, there is,
their adventures.

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.798
It's very funny that way;
it has moments like that.

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.071
Again, but, as with
Galatea,

00:12:26.071 --> 00:12:29.677
the Persiles is
important because it was written

00:12:29.677 --> 00:12:32.350
by the author of the
Quixote.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.183
As a playwright,
Cervantes was a master in the

00:12:36.183 --> 00:12:39.783
comic one-act interludes,
the entremeses that I

00:12:39.783 --> 00:12:42.918
have spoken about,
which show many features in

00:12:42.918 --> 00:12:47.054
common with the Quixote,
particularly the funny parts of

00:12:47.054 --> 00:12:49.666
the Quixote,
the slapstick parts of the

00:12:49.666 --> 00:12:54.423
Quixote,
but his plays were stiff and

00:12:54.423 --> 00:13:02.450
neoclassical because Cervantes
followed the rules that the

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:08.043
preceptistas,
those who had read Aristotle's

00:13:08.043 --> 00:13:13.090
Poetics,
were promoting at the time.

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.500
You remember the discussions
among the characters,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.399
I think it is chapter XLVIII of
Part I,

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.830
especially involving the Canon
of Toledo,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.000
about the plays being written
at the time,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.558
where Cervantes,
through his characters,

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:31.590
is criticizing Lope for not
following those rules.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:36.269
He did, and then his plays were
duds;

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:40.918
they were just--some are okay,
but they're not that good.

00:13:40.918 --> 00:13:45.775
It is one of those ironies of
literary history that Cervantes

00:13:45.775 --> 00:13:50.389
was so wildly imaginative and
daring in prose fiction,

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:54.809
was so timid and conservative
when it came to the theater...

00:13:54.809 --> 00:13:56.840
A mystery.
 

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.500
This is why you cannot just
list authors;

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.797
you have works,
you have to list works,

00:14:02.797 --> 00:14:06.241
when you are making a hit
parade like the one Harold Bloom

00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:08.538
makes in The Western
Canon.

00:14:08.538 --> 00:14:15.173
So the high point of Cervantes'
production other than the

00:14:15.173 --> 00:14:20.009
Quixote was Exemplary
Novels,

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:22.961
or Stories,
as they're called in the

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:25.278
translation that you are using.
 

00:14:25.278 --> 00:14:28.528
This is a terminological
problem that I have explained

00:14:28.528 --> 00:14:29.080
before.
 

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.827
The word
"novela"

00:14:30.827 --> 00:14:34.110
that we have in Spanish for
novel today, did not exist then.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.888
"Novela"
was

00:14:35.888 --> 00:14:38.428
"nouvelle,"
that is,

00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:41.269
a short novel,
or a long short story,

00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:44.110
like the ones we have read:
Rinconete and

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.594
Cortadillo,
The Glass Graduate,

00:14:46.594 --> 00:14:49.779
and the ones that are included
in Part I of the Quixote.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:53.000
These are the Novelas
ejemplares.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.986
Some of these short novels are
true masterpieces of the genre

00:14:58.986 --> 00:15:04.475
and can stand next to the
greatest stories by Cervantes'

00:15:04.475 --> 00:15:08.928
Italian predecessors,
of course, Giovanni Boccaccio,

00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:11.100
whom I have mentioned many
times,

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.289
and Matteo Bandello,
whom I have also mentioned

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:16.110
before.
 

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:20.958
Now, I have mentioned them when
we discussed some of these

00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:25.722
novels, mainly The Glass
Graduate and Rinconete

00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:27.678
and Cortadillo.
 

00:15:27.678 --> 00:15:32.394
Today, I'm going to speak about
The Deceitful Marriage

00:15:32.394 --> 00:15:37.523
and The Dogs Colloquy,
two connected novels that wind

00:15:37.523 --> 00:15:41.529
up the volume of The
Exemplary Novels or

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:43.970
Exemplary Stories.
 

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:46.410
I have trouble saying
Exemplary Stories because

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:47.977
it's just not stories,
it's novels,

00:15:47.977 --> 00:15:48.899
or short novels.
 

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:51.740
So I may waiver,
but you know what I mean,

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.581
it's Novelas ejemplares
in Spanish,

00:15:54.581 --> 00:15:56.870
not Exemplary Stories.
 

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:02.655
Now, as we approach these two
novels, we have to return to the

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:03.889
picaresque.
 

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:07.850
Now, let me summarize the
reasons why the picaresque was

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:12.024
so important in the development
of prose fiction and repeat

00:16:12.024 --> 00:16:14.811
myself,
unless you think that I am

00:16:14.811 --> 00:16:18.580
arbitrarily obsessed with this
kind of literature.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.166
It's just that it is truly very
important for the development of

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:24.038
the novel.
 

00:16:24.038 --> 00:16:28.500
Now, in the picaresque there is
for the first time,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.264
except for
Celestina--but

00:16:31.264 --> 00:16:36.350
Celestina was a dialogue,
a dramatic dialogue.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.210
It was not a story with a
narrator,

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:42.190
and so forth--so in the
picaresque there is,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.038
for the first time,
the representation of every day

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:49.230
life and common people,
with an emphasis on poor people

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:52.730
engaged in the struggle for
existence,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:57.491
in a setting that is
contemporaneous with the author

00:16:57.491 --> 00:17:01.634
and the reader;
both the author and the reader

00:17:01.634 --> 00:17:05.210
recognize the setting as being
their own.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.490
It's the present.
 

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:11.942
There is no fancy far away
geography, as in the romances of

00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:14.858
chivalry, or the Byzantine
romances;

00:17:14.858 --> 00:17:20.372
there is no remote time,
like the magical time of

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:24.788
fantastic stories;
the picaresque novels take

00:17:24.788 --> 00:17:26.990
place in the here and now.
 

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:33.630
The protagonist is no hero by
conventional literary standards.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.622
On the contrary,
he or she, because there are

00:17:37.622 --> 00:17:41.224
feminine picaresques,
and we're going to be talking

00:17:41.224 --> 00:17:44.042
about one today,
is a minor criminal in trouble

00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:45.943
with the law,
and, in fact,

00:17:45.943 --> 00:17:50.185
the center conceit of novels
like Lazarillo de Tormes

00:17:50.185 --> 00:17:53.997
and Guzmán de
Alfareche is that the text

00:17:53.997 --> 00:17:57.807
is a confession or deposition
addressed by the accused

00:17:57.807 --> 00:18:00.900
delinquent to a figure in
authority.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.000
So the picaresque is an
indictment of society written in

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.526
the form of the legal documents,
used by the authorities to

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:13.578
enmesh the pícaro
in the net of the law.

00:18:13.578 --> 00:18:18.400
We saw how Don Quixote and
Sancho themselves are fugitives

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.221
from justice and are finally
apprehended by the trooper of

00:18:23.221 --> 00:18:26.881
the Holy Brotherhood,
that funny trooper of the Holy

00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:28.828
Brotherhood who cannot read very
well,

00:18:28.828 --> 00:18:31.618
if you remember that hilarious
scene from Part I.

00:18:31.618 --> 00:18:35.513
The picaresque makes possible
for the novel to depict

00:18:35.513 --> 00:18:39.108
contemporary society and common
social types,

00:18:39.108 --> 00:18:43.150
such as the ones appearing and
acquiring relevance in the

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.818
sixteenth and seventeenth
century,

00:18:45.818 --> 00:18:50.124
as it is the beginnings of what
is a leveling of society that is

00:18:50.124 --> 00:18:53.881
moving towards the eighteenth
century and the nineteenth

00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:55.557
century,
and revolutions,

00:18:55.557 --> 00:18:57.818
and so forth,
that we are very familiar with.

00:18:57.818 --> 00:19:01.269
So these characters begin to
appear in novels,

00:19:01.269 --> 00:19:03.990
as well as in paintings,
if you remember the paintings

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.328
by Velázquez that we have
looked at during the semester.

00:19:07.328 --> 00:19:10.615
Rafael Salillas,
whom I have mentioned before

00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:15.502
but I want to mention again,
Rafael Salillas,

00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:22.582
a brilliant Spanish
criminologist of the late

00:19:22.582 --> 00:19:29.500
nineteenth and early twentieth
century,

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.695
claimed that the picaresque was
the origin of the social

00:19:34.695 --> 00:19:38.455
sciences,
specifically sociology and

00:19:38.455 --> 00:19:39.769
criminology.
 

00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:43.378
That is, sociology and
criminology find their source in

00:19:43.378 --> 00:19:47.051
these kinds of novels,
these kinds of picaresque

00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:51.377
novels that depict the lower
strata of society in great

00:19:51.377 --> 00:19:52.180
detail.
 

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:59.573
He includes Cervantes' work
among those works that he places

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:04.460
at the origin of the social
sciences.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.884
So it is, to me,
very suggestive,

00:20:08.884 --> 00:20:12.477
then,
that Cervantes chose to wind up

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:16.570
his volume of Exemplary
Novels with these two

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.380
stories in the picaresque style.
 

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.364
Not picaresque per se,
because Cervantes never wrote a

00:20:23.364 --> 00:20:26.019
picaresque novel in the strict
sense,

00:20:26.019 --> 00:20:31.740
but novels with a picaresque
ambience and cast of characters.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:37.167
Remember, this is a book you
only have a selection in your

00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:39.930
book of translated stories.
 

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.348
The volume consists of a
prologue, parts of which are

00:20:44.348 --> 00:20:48.855
included in my essay in the
Casebook about self

00:20:48.855 --> 00:20:52.170
portraits, and then twelve
stories.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:55.493
Remember, I talked about that
number because if The

00:20:55.493 --> 00:20:57.940
Pretended Aunt was by
Cervantes,

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.354
maybe he didn't include it
because he didn't want the

00:21:00.354 --> 00:21:01.190
number thirteen.
 

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.917
But in any case,
there are twelve stories and

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:07.171
these two,
The Deceitful Marriage

00:21:07.171 --> 00:21:08.880
and The Dogs Colloquy are
the end,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.136
The Deceitful Marriage
and The Dogs Colloquy,

00:21:11.136 --> 00:21:12.500
and that's the end of the
volume.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:16.519
The order of stories in such a
volume is always significant.

00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:22.376
So, to me, it is significant
that the volume should end with

00:21:22.376 --> 00:21:26.845
these two stories,
these interlocking stories,

00:21:26.845 --> 00:21:27.640
too.
 

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.990
Now, as we saw with Roque
Guinart,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.029
the Catalan bandit,
with Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:39.777
the galley slave,
and then later master

00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:44.076
puppeteer,
and Monipodio in Rinconete

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:48.180
and Cortadillo,
Cervantes often pains a

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.519
sympathetic portrait of criminal
types.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:55.104
At least, he never paints one
that is one-sidedly negative,

00:21:55.104 --> 00:21:58.380
and he seems to have a liking
for these characters.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:01.868
One reason may be that,
like Don Quixote,

00:22:01.868 --> 00:22:04.269
who is also a delinquent--as we
know--

00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:07.548
they represent original ways of
life,

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:11.098
different from mainstream
society, hence,

00:22:11.098 --> 00:22:14.548
more interesting and appealing
from a literary point of view.

00:22:14.548 --> 00:22:17.211
If you are good,
you're not interesting to

00:22:17.211 --> 00:22:19.288
literature, for the most part.
 

00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:22.115
So these criminal types are
interesting because they are

00:22:22.115 --> 00:22:24.479
criminals, and they're
different, and they have

00:22:24.479 --> 00:22:26.740
different lives that are quite
original.

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.838
We saw the same tendency in
Velázquez.

00:22:28.838 --> 00:22:32.022
Velázquez paints dwarves
and near criminals,

00:22:32.022 --> 00:22:34.887
and all of that,
because they are interesting,

00:22:34.887 --> 00:22:35.779
different.
 

00:22:35.779 --> 00:22:42.088
Also, criminal life--and this
would go back to Salillas--

00:22:42.088 --> 00:22:46.727
could represent the origins of
societal of norms or how

00:22:46.727 --> 00:22:52.164
societal norms develop,
norms that emerge out of the

00:22:52.164 --> 00:22:55.971
clash of instincts,
desires, laws,

00:22:55.971 --> 00:23:00.176
and so forth,
and this is why the criminals

00:23:00.176 --> 00:23:02.078
are interesting.
 

00:23:02.078 --> 00:23:05.021
If you follow the law and all
of that, you're not very

00:23:05.021 --> 00:23:05.798
interesting.
 

00:23:05.798 --> 00:23:10.104
The penchant for criminal types
found in the picaresque and in

00:23:10.104 --> 00:23:14.618
Cervantes is something that will
become a staple of the novel;

00:23:14.618 --> 00:23:19.481
especially the nineteenth
century novel is peopled by

00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.036
criminals of all kind,
interesting,

00:23:23.036 --> 00:23:27.599
sometimes appealing criminals
of all kinds,

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:29.230
like Jean Valjean, and so forth.
 

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:35.430
So we move to these stories,
The Deceitful Marriage,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.250
El casamiento
engañoso, and The

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.209
Dogs Colloquy,
El coloquio de los

00:23:41.209 --> 00:23:42.180
perros.
 

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.910
Now, notice that these two
stories,

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:47.440
one implanted into the other,
as it were,

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.445
follow the narrative device
called "the framed

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:53.759
tale," that is,
the tale within the tale.

00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:57.726
It's a device that goes back to
the origins of story telling in

00:23:57.726 --> 00:24:00.990
the Thousand and One Nights,
for instance.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:06.965
Now, it allows Cervantes to
finish his volume of stories

00:24:06.965 --> 00:24:13.269
with one of his cherished
infinitely receding sequences.

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:16.257
Remember, we've spoken about
these infinitely receding

00:24:16.257 --> 00:24:18.565
sequences,
one within the other,

00:24:18.565 --> 00:24:21.469
within the other,
within the other,

00:24:21.469 --> 00:24:25.298
I often use the example of the
little boy,

00:24:25.298 --> 00:24:27.838
as I remember myself sitting in
a barber chair,

00:24:27.838 --> 00:24:30.137
surrounded by mirrors,
and then seeing myself

00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:32.960
disappear in the distance all
the images of myself,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:39.029
and also the can of evaporated
milk that has depicted a can,

00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:41.048
and so forth,
and so on, so this is what the

00:24:41.048 --> 00:24:44.598
device is,
a story within the story.

00:24:44.598 --> 00:24:50.140
They are like Chinese boxes,
one inside the other.

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:53.692
It is a form of closure,
if we're thinking that they

00:24:53.692 --> 00:24:58.078
close or they finish the book
that denies closure as it were.

00:24:58.078 --> 00:25:01.398
The volume is opened ended,
but it's open ended sort of

00:25:01.398 --> 00:25:03.701
open on to itself,
there could be more,

00:25:03.701 --> 00:25:05.420
and more, and more stories
down,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.750
if you dug deeper into these
stories.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.690
There could be yet another
story which,

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:16.314
indeed, there is one story that
is virtual or postponed in the

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:19.578
second story,
The Dogs Colloquy,

00:25:19.578 --> 00:25:23.660
because the story of one of the
dog's life is not told,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.078
so this is what I mean.
 

00:25:25.078 --> 00:25:30.336
When I wrote an essay on this
many years ago I called it

00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:36.069
"The Life of Scipio,"
saying that my essay was sort

00:25:36.069 --> 00:25:42.568
of like the telling of this life
that was not told in the story.

00:25:42.568 --> 00:25:46.494
Now, in The Deceitful
Marriage,

00:25:46.494 --> 00:25:52.224
marriage is deconstructed,
as it were, both as a social

00:25:52.224 --> 00:25:56.470
institution and as a narrative
tool.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.624
We should read the story
against the backdrop of all of

00:26:00.624 --> 00:26:04.701
the stories about marriage that
we have read in the

00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:08.319
Quixote,
and also in the context of

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:10.720
The Pretended Aunt.
 

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.178
In fact, The Deceitful
Marriage is a story of

00:26:15.178 --> 00:26:20.597
Cervantes that comes closest in
salaciousness to that contested

00:26:20.597 --> 00:26:23.519
story,
The Pretended Aunt.

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:26.969
That is, it's the dirtiest of
Cervantes' stories,

00:26:26.969 --> 00:26:30.490
if The Pretended Aunt is
not Cervantes'.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:36.421
I'm sure you will agree with
me, and you will agree more with

00:26:36.421 --> 00:26:39.980
me once you hear my reading of
it.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:44.436
Estefanía,
the protagonist,

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:48.795
is a proactive female;
protagonist,

00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:53.073
a female protagonist,
like others in Cervantes:

00:26:53.073 --> 00:26:55.769
Dorotea, Marcela,
Zoraida.

00:26:55.769 --> 00:27:00.820
Who charts her own course and
follows it with cunning and with

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.650
courage.
 

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.586
Of course, she is a prostitute,
but she is a proactive female

00:27:06.586 --> 00:27:08.808
protagonist of Cervantes.
 

00:27:08.808 --> 00:27:16.460
She dupes ensign Campuzano
luring him with her beauty and

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:24.108
pretended wealth--we could call
it--to whit her house.

00:27:24.108 --> 00:27:27.057
Notice the detail,
I told you to look for details

00:27:27.057 --> 00:27:27.980
in Cervantes.
 

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.808
How does she lure the ensign?
 

00:27:30.808 --> 00:27:34.054
She has beautiful hands,
and that is the first thing

00:27:34.054 --> 00:27:36.788
that the ensign notices when he
sees her.

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:40.528
Cervantes has sort of a fetish
for hands, and feet,

00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:44.565
too, you remember Dorotea,
but mostly, Estefanía

00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:46.358
has beautiful hands.
 

00:27:46.358 --> 00:27:50.329
She traps him into marrying
her, but then it turns out she

00:27:50.329 --> 00:27:52.630
was not the owner of the house.
 

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:57.445
That the true proprietors come
back and she scampers with the

00:27:57.445 --> 00:28:01.538
jewels with which she thought he
had fooled her--

00:28:01.538 --> 00:28:06.221
he thought that he had fooled
her, because he boasts that

00:28:06.221 --> 00:28:10.068
they're counterfeit anyway,
the jewels that she steels.

00:28:10.068 --> 00:28:15.443
It turns out,
however, that she had the last

00:28:15.443 --> 00:28:18.740
laugh,
because she had infected him

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.948
with syphilis,
a kind of delayed action

00:28:22.948 --> 00:28:28.598
counterblow,
by which she wins again.

00:28:28.598 --> 00:28:36.140
It is clear that what
Estefanía did was her MO,

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:40.154
her modus operandi,
and that the ensign was neither

00:28:40.154 --> 00:28:42.410
her first nor her last victim.
 

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:46.834
The cousin, the so-called
cousin, who's present at this

00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:49.618
wedding, was obviously her pimp.
 

00:28:49.618 --> 00:28:54.544
Well, not obviously,
Cervantes doesn't make things

00:28:54.544 --> 00:28:57.759
that obvious,
but it is there.

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:59.490
Who was this guy?
 

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:06.413
Well, this guy is obviously her
pimp, and this is a routine that

00:29:06.413 --> 00:29:12.240
they use to ensnare guys like
the ensign Campuzano.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.164
He, of course,
thinks that he's also going to

00:29:16.164 --> 00:29:19.715
have a good time,
and that he's going to fool

00:29:19.715 --> 00:29:23.577
her, because he's making plans
to scamper and go back to war

00:29:23.577 --> 00:29:26.259
once he has had enough of a good
time.

00:29:26.259 --> 00:29:31.310
What is of interest to me in
the story is how Cervantes has

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.358
manipulated literary
conventions.

00:29:34.358 --> 00:29:38.960
The story begins with a
marriage, virtually,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.930
that is, it begins where
stories normally end,

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.288
and works backwards,
to undue a union that never

00:29:46.288 --> 00:29:50.525
took place legitimately;
it is a marriage into which

00:29:50.525 --> 00:29:54.108
they enter presumably without
pretense or illusions.

00:29:54.108 --> 00:30:00.314
She tells him that she's no
virgin and that she has had her

00:30:00.314 --> 00:30:02.910
life,
and this and that,

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.930
he doesn't care,
and he, of course,

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.990
is not a wealthy aristocrat by
any means,

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:10.684
and they know,
so they enter presumably

00:30:10.684 --> 00:30:12.470
without illusions into this
marriage,

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:16.540
but the marriage,
of course, is based on worse

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:18.170
forms of deceit.
 

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:23.000
It also ends with an inversion
at the end that should have been

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.210
a beginning: the man is fooled,
and the woman flees.

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.643
In traditional stories,
it is the opposite:

00:30:30.643 --> 00:30:34.650
the woman is fooled and the
man, the guy flees.

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.490
Marriages, as we have seen
throughout the semester,

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.640
are normally how stories end,
I repeat.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.901
They bring closure to the
action representing the

00:30:44.901 --> 00:30:48.910
restoration of order and the
continuation of the species.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.005
Here, however,
Cervantes has inverted the

00:30:52.005 --> 00:30:55.410
formula, the story begins with a
marriage.

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:59.500
As we have seen,
and I have said many times,

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.700
perhaps too many times
throughout the semester,

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:05.337
and it's not a warning to you,
everything that happens before

00:31:05.337 --> 00:31:08.250
marriage is the stuff of comedy
in Cervantes,

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:10.336
everything that happens after
marriage is the stuff of

00:31:10.336 --> 00:31:10.730
tragedy.
 

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:16.998
But here, surely because the
marriage is phony,

00:31:16.998 --> 00:31:22.038
what follows is comical,
and worse.

00:31:22.038 --> 00:31:25.034
The marriage,
by the way, would have been

00:31:25.034 --> 00:31:30.203
annulled under Spanish law,
and even church canon law had

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:36.256
the ensign sued Estefanía
for misrepresenting herself:

00:31:36.256 --> 00:31:40.190
she was not the owner of the
house,

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:41.279
and so forth.
 

00:31:41.279 --> 00:31:44.150
But he could not sue her
because he,

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:45.970
too, had misrepresented his
wealth,

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:51.817
the jewels were counterfeit,
and he also had plans to quit

00:31:51.817 --> 00:31:55.410
the premises as soon as he
could.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:32:00.019
Now, the emblem of all of these
deceits is the house,

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:03.035
which should have,
on the contrary,

00:32:03.035 --> 00:32:06.759
or normally,
provided the foundation of the

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.088
marriage.
 

00:32:08.088 --> 00:32:12.421
It is in the house that they
spend a brief period of

00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:14.118
matrimonial bliss.
 

00:32:14.118 --> 00:32:17.163
This is the
engaño part that

00:32:17.163 --> 00:32:20.058
precedes the
desengaño.

00:32:20.058 --> 00:32:23.903
Legally and traditionally the
house is the concrete site of

00:32:23.903 --> 00:32:27.826
marriage,
and in Spanish the word for

00:32:27.826 --> 00:32:33.513
marriage,
the word that is in the title

00:32:33.513 --> 00:32:40.670
of the story is
"casamiento."

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.009
"Casa"
means "house"

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:44.828
in Spanish.
 

00:32:44.828 --> 00:32:46.461
I like to add
"casa-

00:32:46.461 --> 00:32:49.200
miento"
means "house-I-lie";

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.257
"miento"
from "mentir,"

00:32:51.257 --> 00:32:52.470
"to lie,"
in Spanish;

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:55.328
it's a phony etymology that I
makeup.

00:32:55.328 --> 00:32:59.400
It's also one of those things
that language--

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.880
gifts that language makes to
humor,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.816
and the word for
"wife"

00:33:05.816 --> 00:33:08.097
in Spanish,
as you probably know,

00:33:08.097 --> 00:33:11.317
is "esposa,"
which is also the word for

00:33:11.317 --> 00:33:12.778
"handcuffs."
 

00:33:12.778 --> 00:33:19.740
I didn't invent the language,
and it is also a false

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.380
etymology.
 

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:27.782
In any case,
so the house is the emblem of

00:33:27.782 --> 00:33:34.029
this house, casa-miento,
I lie.

00:33:34.029 --> 00:33:41.440
The plot of The Deceitful
Marriage is indeed very,

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.974
very disturbing,
because it leads to total

00:33:44.974 --> 00:33:48.855
disorder,
to a disillusion of the social

00:33:48.855 --> 00:33:52.059
pact,
the social contract altogether,

00:33:52.059 --> 00:33:52.880
it seems.
 

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.680
This is why I find it such a
disturbing story.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.031
Husband and wife
disappear--they are not really

00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:05.982
husband and wife--
one never to be heard from

00:34:05.982 --> 00:34:09.340
again, Estefanía
vanishes,

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.739
she has to vanish,
like the galley slaves,

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.400
because probably the
authorities are after her,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:21.132
and he winds up in the hospital
with a social disease from which

00:34:21.132 --> 00:34:24.340
most people never recovered.
 

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.469
It is as if the story,
with this formal play of

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:32.059
inversions is hinting not at
tragedy,

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:36.268
but at something perhaps worse,
if that is possible,

00:34:36.268 --> 00:34:41.358
the disappearance of old bones,
the unraveling of the discourse

00:34:41.358 --> 00:34:45.380
that hold human society together
and organized.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.179
This is what is hinted at,
by this very disturbing story.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:53.615
Indeed, what follows is the
story of the ensign Campuzano in

00:34:53.615 --> 00:34:56.904
the hospital,
and the hallucination that

00:34:56.904 --> 00:34:59.789
leads him to write the next
story,

00:34:59.789 --> 00:35:01.989
The Dogs Colloquy.
 

00:35:01.989 --> 00:35:05.393
It is ironic,
in a way that I find more

00:35:05.393 --> 00:35:10.052
bitter than is normal in
Cervantes that what leads to

00:35:10.052 --> 00:35:15.159
literary creation here is not
just a social disease,

00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:20.599
but the disease of love,
called at the time--

00:35:20.599 --> 00:35:22.349
syphilis--was called at the
time in Spanish,

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:23.922
"el mal
francés,"

00:35:23.922 --> 00:35:25.219
"the French disease."
 

00:35:25.219 --> 00:35:29.936
I don't know why the Spanish
always blame the French for

00:35:29.936 --> 00:35:32.940
everything having to do with
sex.

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:40.688
The love madness of courtly
love poets is literalized here,

00:35:40.688 --> 00:35:45.900
love madness,
this is a love disease.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.768
It literalizes a venereal
illness.

00:35:49.768 --> 00:35:54.904
The Dogs Colloquy is
like Estefanía's and the

00:35:54.904 --> 00:35:59.010
ensign's child;
it is the product of their

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.010
deceitful marriage.
 

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:07.820
This is I find a very
disturbing suggestion.

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.510
So we move to The Dogs
Colloquy.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:17.581
Let me begin by considering the
names of the dogs,

00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:22.342
the heroic Scipio,
Cipión in Spanish and

00:36:22.342 --> 00:36:25.239
the picaresque Berganza.
 

00:36:25.239 --> 00:36:27.130
These are the two dogs.
 

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.630
Historically,
there were two Scipios,

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.489
the one who took and destroyed
Carthage,

00:36:34.489 --> 00:36:37.952
and his son,
who destroyed the Spanish town

00:36:37.952 --> 00:36:42.195
of Numancia,
an event on which Cervantes

00:36:42.195 --> 00:36:46.650
based perhaps his most
successful play.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.429
So he knew well about Scipio.
 

00:36:48.429 --> 00:36:55.182
Berganza is derived from
"bergante,"

00:36:55.182 --> 00:36:59.599
slightly old-fashioned word
now.

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:07.996
"Bergante"
is a rogue, a rascal,

00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:15.516
whereas, of course,
Scipio is a heroic name,

00:37:15.516 --> 00:37:21.989
the name of a military
commander.

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:27.327
The two dogs make up a pair,
like Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:37:27.327 --> 00:37:31.713
if you think of it,
the sort of picaresque type

00:37:31.713 --> 00:37:35.239
Berganza and the military
Scipio.

00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:38.121
Scipio's life,
the one not told,

00:37:38.121 --> 00:37:42.675
is suggested that could have
been another Quixote,

00:37:42.675 --> 00:37:47.228
but in a different key,
a Quixote in a canine key,

00:37:47.228 --> 00:37:48.809
as it were.
 

00:37:48.809 --> 00:37:55.440
It would be a mock heroic dog's
life, we could call it.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.170
It's just suggested.
 

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:03.864
Now, ensign Campuzano's
predicament linking illness and

00:38:03.864 --> 00:38:07.211
creativity is a spoof,
as I have said,

00:38:07.211 --> 00:38:11.822
of the sick lover poet able to
compose poetry because of his

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:12.840
condition.
 

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.903
This will become a romantic
trope, only that here it is this

00:38:17.903 --> 00:38:22.882
illness is dramatically and
literally an illness of love of

00:38:22.882 --> 00:38:24.599
the lowest kind.
 

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:30.809
Remember, that the only cure,
other than some potions and

00:38:30.809 --> 00:38:36.355
stuff, is to let him sweat it
out in this hospital,

00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:40.679
and some survive,
but not too many.

00:38:40.679 --> 00:38:43.342
Notice also,
the ironic name of the

00:38:43.342 --> 00:38:46.710
hospital, I don't know if you
noticed it.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.719
It's Hospital de la
Resurrección,

00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:53.840
Hospital of the Resurrection
and this is out of--

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.719
through a kind of resurrection
ensign Campuzano comes out after

00:38:57.719 --> 00:39:04.210
he has sweated out his syphilis,
or at least part of his

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.079
syphilis.
 

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:11.255
Now, Cervantes skirts here the
supernatural in the story,

00:39:11.255 --> 00:39:14.030
the idea that dogs can talk.
 

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.000
The supernatural never appears
in Cervantes' works,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.815
but he leaves open here the
possibility that the story of

00:39:21.815 --> 00:39:26.630
the dogs talking is merely a
hallucination on the part of

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:32.041
Campuzano,
who's ill, and in his illness

00:39:32.041 --> 00:39:36.018
and fever he imagines this.
 

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:39.070
It can also be a literary rouse
on the part of the ensign;

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.869
I mean, it is the character
within the story who is making

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:46.480
this up, Cervantes would say.
 

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.159
He wants to live in an
ambiguous state,

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:49.840
the origin of his literary
creation.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:54.139
To me it is very suggestive.
 

00:39:54.139 --> 00:39:58.646
I don't know if you found it
so, that he falls asleep while

00:39:58.646 --> 00:40:02.311
his lawyer friend,
called Graduate Peralta in your

00:40:02.311 --> 00:40:05.050
translation,
licenciado Peralta,

00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:07.809
it means a lawyer;
he is a graduate in law.

00:40:07.809 --> 00:40:12.110
I find it very suggestive that
the author falls asleep while

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:14.369
Peralta is reading his story.
 

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:19.684
As well, I mean it's also very
significant that the reader is

00:40:19.684 --> 00:40:23.403
someone, a lawyer,
trained to read text and

00:40:23.403 --> 00:40:26.150
ascertain the truthfulness.
 

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.923
This is sort of an ironic
reading scene,

00:40:30.923 --> 00:40:38.760
no, the lawyer reading this to
tell whether it is true or not.

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:45.521
Now, on one level it is as if
the text belongs to the realm of

00:40:45.521 --> 00:40:48.728
dreams,
the fact that he's sleeping,

00:40:48.728 --> 00:40:53.300
and it is as if the reader is
tapping directly into his dreams

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.800
as he's sleeping.
 

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:58.242
It occurs to me,
because its author is asleep

00:40:58.242 --> 00:41:00.119
while it's being read.
 

00:41:00.119 --> 00:41:04.505
On another, it is as if there
is a gap between creator and the

00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:08.460
text needed for the reader to
judge it independently.

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:11.182
That is, he's asleep,
he's no longer in control of

00:41:11.182 --> 00:41:13.286
the text,
the text is now in the hands of

00:41:13.286 --> 00:41:15.315
the reader,
and it is for the reader to

00:41:15.315 --> 00:41:17.269
determine whether it is true or
not;

00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:21.699
this is why he is asleep.
 

00:41:21.699 --> 00:41:25.336
Of course, this is also a way
of having him do something while

00:41:25.336 --> 00:41:26.650
the other one reads.
 

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:29.954
The other way would have been
to have him go to the market or

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.590
something,
but I think this is much more

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:34.440
interesting and suggestive,
the fact that he falls asleep.

00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:38.039
I like to think of it as that
the reader is tapping directly

00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:40.420
into his subconscious as he's
asleep.

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:46.056
Now, Peralta,
in a way, is a stand in for us,

00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:47.849
the readers.
 

00:41:47.849 --> 00:41:51.429
He offers a literary judgment
at the end,

00:41:51.429 --> 00:41:55.739
pronouncing the story good,
though hardly believable,

00:41:55.739 --> 00:41:59.500
and encouraging his friend to
go ahead and write the next

00:41:59.500 --> 00:41:59.969
life.
 

00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:03.150
Notice, in the context of my
discussion of the ending of

00:42:03.150 --> 00:42:05.579
the Quixote in the last
lecture,

00:42:05.579 --> 00:42:09.278
that life in here is the shape
of the story:

00:42:09.278 --> 00:42:11.431
a life,
the life of Berganza,

00:42:11.431 --> 00:42:15.000
and the next life is going to
be the life of Cipión,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.800
of Scipio.
 

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:19.952
It is also, of course,
following in that the shape of

00:42:19.952 --> 00:42:24.503
the picaresque that we saw when
we discussed the figure of

00:42:24.503 --> 00:42:29.079
Ginés de Pasamonte,
who's written his life in

00:42:29.079 --> 00:42:31.849
prison, and so forth,
and so on.

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:36.237
Now, there is more than a hint,
too, that the story that the

00:42:36.237 --> 00:42:40.030
ensign tells or writes through
the dog is an encoded

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:41.369
autobiography.
 

00:42:41.369 --> 00:42:45.980
This is a picaresque
autobiography in which the

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:50.389
pícaro pretends to
be a dog.

00:42:50.389 --> 00:42:57.432
It's very ingenious and
inventive turn on Cervantes'

00:42:57.432 --> 00:42:58.400
part.
 

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.590
Why is it autobiographical?
 

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:05.443
Particularly,
because when he takes the

00:43:05.443 --> 00:43:10.250
manuscript from his pocket he
takes it out of his seno.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:12.409
"Seno"
means his "bosom";

00:43:12.409 --> 00:43:19.056
he's taking it out of his heart
in a way, so this suggests to me

00:43:19.056 --> 00:43:25.492
that this is ensign Campuzano's
story, but told deflected into

00:43:25.492 --> 00:43:28.130
the life of this dog.
 

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:35.063
It is very interesting that
literature issues out of these

00:43:35.063 --> 00:43:39.929
tawdry living conditions and
figures,

00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:43.271
literary creation,
as it did in the case of

00:43:43.271 --> 00:43:48.369
Ginés de Pasamonte,
who wrote his life while he was

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:51.353
in prison,
and also in the case of

00:43:51.353 --> 00:43:56.306
Cervantes himself who's life,
if not quite as tawdry,

00:43:56.306 --> 00:44:01.389
sometimes was like that when he
was a prisoner,

00:44:01.389 --> 00:44:06.780
a captive, in Algiers,
and the couple of times when he

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:12.987
was really in jail in Spain for
irregularities in his accounts

00:44:12.987 --> 00:44:18.277
when he was collecting for the
Spanish Armada,

00:44:18.277 --> 00:44:20.210
and so forth.
 

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:26.981
So I think this is Cervantes'
take on the origins of modern

00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:31.847
literature;
it originates in these

00:44:31.847 --> 00:44:38.239
conditions and out of figures
like these.

00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:44.706
Now, the point is that he's
showing the virtual workings of

00:44:44.706 --> 00:44:50.623
the literary imagination,
which deflects the real and the

00:44:50.623 --> 00:44:54.320
tawdry or the seedy life of the
ensign,

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.289
and deflect it into the life of
the dog,

00:44:57.289 --> 00:45:01.865
which has a slightly classical
form because of the fables where

00:45:01.865 --> 00:45:03.581
dogs speak,
and so forth,

00:45:03.581 --> 00:45:05.260
that are mentioned in the text.
 

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:11.255
Now, the uncertain origin of
the dogs who could also be the

00:45:11.255 --> 00:45:17.170
transformed sons of that witch,
in that marvelous scene with

00:45:17.170 --> 00:45:20.768
the witches that I am sure you
remember,

00:45:20.768 --> 00:45:25.179
and that allude or harken back
to Celestina,

00:45:25.179 --> 00:45:32.750
or they could have been simply
dogs born, where?

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:36.429
in the slaughterhouse of
Seville, remember,

00:45:36.429 --> 00:45:40.634
Seville is the capital of
picaresque life and the

00:45:40.634 --> 00:45:45.802
slaughterhouse seems to be the
capital within the capital of

00:45:45.802 --> 00:45:47.730
picaresque life.
 

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:52.894
But it also--Cervantes' is also
leaving the origin of the story

00:45:52.894 --> 00:45:57.309
in an air of indeterminacy,
sort of like Don Quixote's

00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:58.309
origins.
 

00:45:58.309 --> 00:46:03.429
I think that the significance
of the ending of the story,

00:46:03.429 --> 00:46:07.530
again, back to the infinitely
receding sequences,

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:11.090
is that it brings about no
closure at all to the volume.

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:19.297
So we make a little digression
here before we get towards the

00:46:19.297 --> 00:46:25.452
end of the lecture to discuss
Kafka's parable,

00:46:25.452 --> 00:46:30.239
that I hope you read for today.
 

00:46:30.239 --> 00:46:35.478
Kafka, 1883-1924 as we all know
as a Czech author who wrote in

00:46:35.478 --> 00:46:40.289
German such masterpieces as
The Metamorphoses,

00:46:40.289 --> 00:46:43.822
1915, The Trial,
1925, The Castle,

00:46:43.822 --> 00:46:48.032
1926 in which he presented a
world ruled by arbitrary and

00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:53.041
mysterious bureaucratic laws,
by which the characters seem to

00:46:53.041 --> 00:46:55.730
abide impelled by obscure
forces.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.949
He never published his work,
which he ordered that it be

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:02.168
destroyed upon is death,
a wish that fortunately was not

00:47:02.168 --> 00:47:02.929
followed.
 

00:47:02.929 --> 00:47:08.519
I think that this brief text,
it's just a paragraph shows to

00:47:08.519 --> 00:47:11.891
what extent Kafka,
I think, connected with the

00:47:11.891 --> 00:47:14.039
core of Cervantes' literary
imagination,

00:47:14.039 --> 00:47:20.860
with Cervantes' notion and feel
for literary creativity.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.038
The text is entitled,
"The Truth about Sancho

00:47:24.038 --> 00:47:27.675
Panza" and it says:
"Without making any boast

00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:29.938
of it,
Sancho Panza succeeded in the

00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:33.519
course of years by feeding him a
great number of romances of

00:47:33.519 --> 00:47:37.039
chivalry and adventure in the
evening and night hours,

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:40.349
in so diverting from himself
his demon,

00:47:40.349 --> 00:47:44.030
whom he later called Don
Quixote, that this demon

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.400
thereupon set out uninhibited on
the maddest exploits,

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.516
which however for the lack of a
pre ordained object which should

00:47:51.516 --> 00:47:54.750
have been Sancho Panza himself,
harmed nobody.

00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:58.663
A free man Sancho Panza
resignedly followed Don Quixote

00:47:58.663 --> 00:48:01.487
in his crusades,
perhaps out of a sense of

00:48:01.487 --> 00:48:05.197
responsibility and had of them a
great and edifying entertainment

00:48:05.197 --> 00:48:07.110
to the ends of his days."
 

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:09.849
That's the parable on the truth
of Sancho Panza.

00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:13.626
So I think that Kafka is
turning Cervantes' fiction

00:48:13.626 --> 00:48:16.159
upside down,
but within the spirit of

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:18.925
Cervantes,
by making Sancho the inventor

00:48:18.925 --> 00:48:22.630
of Don Quixote and following him
around afterwards.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.230
The whole fiction comes out of
Sancho's demon,

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.090
that is, the demon of a common
man,

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:32.518
like those, both Kafka and
Cervantes like to invent--

00:48:32.518 --> 00:48:34.820
The Glass Graduate,
for example,

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.570
is another common man--and also
like other authors in Cervantes,

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:41.989
Sancho's creation gets out of
hand,

00:48:41.989 --> 00:48:45.690
and acquires a life of its own.
 

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.510
I think this is Kafka's reading
of Cervantes,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:52.418
I think it is a very profound
reading even if it is or perhaps

00:48:52.418 --> 00:48:54.150
because it is so brief.
 

00:48:54.150 --> 00:49:00.159
I also wish to mention the
Borges story,

00:49:00.159 --> 00:49:02.630
Pierre Menard,
Author of the Quixote,

00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:05.570
which is one of the most famous
stories by Borges,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:09.369
in which, as you remember,
this French poet,

00:49:09.369 --> 00:49:12.070
minor poet, decides to rewrite
the Quixote,

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.300
not just rewrite the
Quixote,

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.510
but word by word,
as Cervantes had written it,

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:21.273
the idea being that it is much
more difficult to write the

00:49:21.273 --> 00:49:24.159
Quixote in seventeenth
century Spanish,

00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:28.983
especially by a Frenchman than
it was for Cervantes to write in

00:49:28.983 --> 00:49:31.219
his own time,
and so forth.

00:49:31.219 --> 00:49:34.139
It is a big literary joke on
the part of Borges,

00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:38.086
but at the same time,
Borges is unsettling the

00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:43.000
romantic notion of the link
between creator and work,

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.360
which he shows he cannot
completely unsettle it,

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:53.324
because Pierre Menard dies
because of the effort it took to

00:49:53.324 --> 00:49:55.695
do this which,
of course, he could never

00:49:55.695 --> 00:49:55.989
finish.
 

00:49:55.989 --> 00:49:59.949
It's an impossible task that he
sets for himself.

00:49:59.949 --> 00:50:06.282
Borges was also reacting,
in 1939, when he wrote the

00:50:06.282 --> 00:50:08.806
story,
to what he considered to be

00:50:08.806 --> 00:50:12.034
sort of proto-fascist readings
of the Quixote by Spanish

00:50:12.034 --> 00:50:12.659
scholars.
 

00:50:12.659 --> 00:50:15.840
Remember, the Spanish Civil War
is just over,

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:19.039
and the promotion of
hispanidad,

00:50:19.039 --> 00:50:21.347
the Spanishness,
and so forth,

00:50:21.347 --> 00:50:25.568
and he's trying to show that
Cervantes' great creation

00:50:25.568 --> 00:50:30.266
doesn't belong to any single
language or any single national

00:50:30.266 --> 00:50:32.987
tradition,
but that it can be,

00:50:32.987 --> 00:50:36.010
potentially,
can be written or rewritten by

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:36.730
anyone.
 

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:42.088
Also, he is underlining
something that he himself said

00:50:42.088 --> 00:50:45.829
with Cervantean self
depreciation,

00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:47.880
that once you write something
that is good,

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.807
it doesn't belong to you any
more, it belongs to the

00:50:49.807 --> 00:50:52.141
tradition,
and so this is what it says,

00:50:52.141 --> 00:50:54.840
the Cervantes creation has
escaped him,

00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.949
because it now belongs to the
tradition,

00:50:56.949 --> 00:50:58.599
not to Cervantes.
 

00:50:58.599 --> 00:51:00.570
This is something that Borges
said.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:05.309
Now, let us finish by talking a
bit about Cervantes' death,

00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:09.150
going back to the beginning of
today's class.

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:13.905
I think that Cervantes
identified with the death of Don

00:51:13.905 --> 00:51:16.460
Quixote and Alonso Quijano.
 

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:20.429
I think that there is an
identification with them,

00:51:20.429 --> 00:51:25.039
because he feels that life as
fiction has to come to an end,

00:51:25.039 --> 00:51:29.809
and a form of truth must be
reached on the brink of death.

00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:33.570
It is a form of truth for which
ironically literature has

00:51:33.570 --> 00:51:36.259
prepared him through the
understanding of

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:38.139
desengaño.
 

00:51:38.139 --> 00:51:42.197
Cervantes seems to be saying
that he, like Don Quixote,

00:51:42.197 --> 00:51:46.630
is renouncing a life of make
belief, so what is the sense of

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:48.360
the novel's ending?
 

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.340
Perhaps it is the feeling of
sadness,

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:54.429
of regret, that the book,
the madness,

00:51:54.429 --> 00:51:56.090
the entertainment,
and the fun,

00:51:56.090 --> 00:52:00.079
have to come to an end,
like everything else.

00:52:00.079 --> 00:52:05.041
It is not so much sense as
meaning, as sense as feeling,

00:52:05.041 --> 00:52:08.920
not sentido as
significado but

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.619
sentido as
sentimiento.

00:52:12.619 --> 00:52:15.309
It's in the sense that Unamuno
uses the word sentimiento

00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:17.090
in the The Tragic Sense of
Life.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.268
So this is the sense of the
ending of the Quixote,

00:52:20.268 --> 00:52:24.731
it is a sense of sadness
redolent with potential

00:52:24.731 --> 00:52:28.155
meanings,
but these are meanings that we

00:52:28.155 --> 00:52:30.440
cannot decipher all together.
 

00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:35.463
Now, in the prologue to the
Persiles which is

00:52:35.463 --> 00:52:40.326
Cervantes' farewell,
he presents himself as a man

00:52:40.326 --> 00:52:45.094
resigned to his impending death,
and content with his

00:52:45.094 --> 00:52:47.547
accomplishments,
going back to what Durán

00:52:47.547 --> 00:52:49.449
had said in the quote at the
very beginning of my lecture.

00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:53.360
The text is Cervantes' farewell.
 

00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.818
The dedication to
Persiles,

00:52:55.818 --> 00:52:58.030
the dedication,
not the prologue,

00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:00.179
but they must have been
contemporaneous,

00:53:00.179 --> 00:53:03.103
contemporary to each other,
was April 19th,

00:53:03.103 --> 00:53:06.583
1616, the dedication,
that is, four days before his

00:53:06.583 --> 00:53:07.280
death.
 

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.992
He says that he was given the
extremunction,

00:53:11.992 --> 00:53:16.422
which is the last rights in the
Catholic Church,

00:53:16.422 --> 00:53:19.909
and then he writes the
following.

00:53:19.909 --> 00:53:28.519
I hope I have it here;
I do, I do...

00:53:28.519 --> 00:53:31.429
Yes.
 

00:53:31.429 --> 00:53:36.360
So, I am going to read it,
it takes five minutes,

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:42.010
in Spanish, and then I'm going
to read it in English.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:45.289
Apologies to those who cannot
follow it in Spanish,

00:53:45.289 --> 00:53:48.764
because I'm going to say
something about the rhythm of

00:53:48.764 --> 00:53:51.519
the prose, and I want you to
hear it:

00:53:51.519 --> 00:53:54.489
"Sucedió,
pues, lector amantísimo,

00:53:54.489 --> 00:53:57.987
que, viniendo otros dos amigos
y yo del famoso lugar de

00:53:57.987 --> 00:54:00.873
Esquivias,
por mil causas famoso,

00:54:00.873 --> 00:54:06.630
una por sus ilustres linajes y
otra por sus ilustrísimos

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.128
vinos,
sentí

00:54:08.128 --> 00:54:11.210
que a mis espaldas venía
picando con gran prisa uno que,

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.309
al parecer, traía deseo
de alcanzarlos,

00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:17.039
y aún lo mostró
dándonos voces,

00:54:17.039 --> 00:54:18.920
que no picásemos tanto.
 

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:21.083
Esperámosle,
y llegó

00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:23.840
sobre una borrica un estudiante
pardal,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:25.969
porque todo venía
vestido de pardo,

00:54:25.969 --> 00:54:29.300
antiparras, zapato redondo y
espada con contera,

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.380
valona bruñida y con
trenzas iguales.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:35.690
Verdad es que no traía
más de dos,

00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:39.030
porque se le venía a un
lado la valona por un momentos,

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.929
y él traía sumo
trabajo y cuenta de enderezarla.

00:54:41.929 --> 00:54:44.657
Llegando a nosotros
dijo:-¿Vuesas mercedes

00:54:44.657 --> 00:54:48.070
van a alcanzar algún
oficio o prebenda a la corte,

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:49.264
pues allá
está su

00:54:49.264 --> 00:54:51.554
Ilustrísima de Toledo,
y su Majestad,

00:54:51.554 --> 00:54:54.670
ni más ni menos,
según la priea con que

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:56.628
caminan,
que en verdad que a mi burra se

00:54:56.628 --> 00:54:59.548
le ha cantado el víctor
de caminante más de una

00:54:59.548 --> 00:54:59.889
vez.
 

00:54:59.889 --> 00:55:02.550
A lo cual respondió
uno de mis compañeros:

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:05.065
-El rocín del
señor Miguel de Cervantes

00:55:05.065 --> 00:55:08.860
tiene la culpa de esto,
porque es algo pasilargo.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.945
Apenas hubo oído el
estudiante el nombre de

00:55:12.945 --> 00:55:15.509
Cervantes,
cuando, apeándose de su

00:55:15.509 --> 00:55:17.485
cabalgadura,
cayéndosele aquí

00:55:17.485 --> 00:55:19.500
el cojín y allí
el portamanteo,

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.179
que con toda esa autoridad
caminaba,

00:55:22.179 --> 00:55:24.525
arremetió a mí y,
acudiendo asirme de la mano

00:55:24.525 --> 00:55:27.056
izquierda,
dijo: '¡Sí,

00:55:27.056 --> 00:55:29.889
sí;
éste es el manco sano,

00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:32.260
el famoso todo,
el escritor alegre y,

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:34.960
finalmente, el regocijo de las
musas!'

00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.989
Yo, que en tanto espacio vi el
grande encomio de mis alabanzas,

00:55:38.989 --> 00:55:40.951
parecióme ser
descortesía no

00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:42.766
corresponder a ellas,
y así,

00:55:42.766 --> 00:55:44.559
abrazándole por el
cuello,

00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:46.481
donde le eché
a perder de todo punto la

00:55:46.481 --> 00:55:48.219
valona,
le dije: 'Ése es un

00:55:48.219 --> 00:55:51.239
error donde han caído
muchos aficionados ignorantes.

00:55:51.239 --> 00:55:53.659
Yo, señor,
soy Cervantes,

00:55:53.659 --> 00:55:56.833
pero no el regocijo de las
musas, ni ninguno de las

00:55:56.833 --> 00:56:00.070
demás baratijas que ha
dicho vuesa merced;

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.586
vuelva a cobrar su burra y
suba, y caminemos en buena

00:56:02.586 --> 00:56:05.250
conversación lo poco que
nos falta de camino.'

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:08.030
Hízolo así
el comedido estudiante,

00:56:08.030 --> 00:56:11.159
tuvimos algún tanto
más las riendas,

00:56:11.159 --> 00:56:13.670
y con paso asentado seguimos
nuestro camino,

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.250
en el cual se trató
de mi enfermedad,

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:17.559
y el buen estudiante me
desahució

00:56:17.559 --> 00:56:20.106
al momento,
diciendo: 'Esta enfermedad es

00:56:20.106 --> 00:56:22.619
de hidropesía,
que no la sanará

00:56:22.619 --> 00:56:25.170
toda el agua del mar
océano que dulcemente se

00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.443
bebiese,
vuesa merced,

00:56:26.443 --> 00:56:28.795
señor Cervantes,
ponga tasa al beber,

00:56:28.795 --> 00:56:31.786
no olvidándose de comer,
que con esto sanará

00:56:31.786 --> 00:56:33.079
sin otra medicina alguna.'
 

00:56:33.079 --> 00:56:36.393
'Esto me han dicho muchos'
respondí

00:56:36.393 --> 00:56:38.208
yo,
'pero así

00:56:38.208 --> 00:56:42.530
puedo dejar de beber a todo mi
beneplácito,

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:44.559
como si para sólo eso
hubiese nacido.

00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:47.280
Mi vida se va acabando,
y, al paso de las

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.905
efemérides de mis pulsos,
que, a más tardar,

00:56:50.905 --> 00:56:53.000
acabarán su carrera este
domingo,

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.809
acabaré yo la de mi vida.
 

00:56:54.809 --> 00:56:58.210
En fuerte punto ha llegado
vuestra merced a conocerme,

00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:01.367
pues no me queda espacio para
mostrarme agradecido a la

00:57:01.367 --> 00:57:03.940
voluntad que vuesa merced me ha
mostrado.'

00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:06.349
En esto llegamos a la puente de
Toledo,

00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:08.786
y yo entré
por ella [they are going into

00:57:08.786 --> 00:57:10.670
Madrid],
y él se apartó

00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:12.018
al entrar por la de Segovia.
 

00:57:12.018 --> 00:57:14.079
Lo que se dirá
de mi suceso,

00:57:14.079 --> 00:57:15.835
tendrá
la fama cuidado,

00:57:15.835 --> 00:57:19.590
mis amigos gana de decirlo,
y yo mayor gana de escucharlo.

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:22.639
Tornéle a abrazar,
volvióseme a ofrecer,

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:25.657
picó a su burra,
y dejóme tan mal

00:57:25.657 --> 00:57:29.199
dispuesto como él iba
caballero en su burra,

00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:32.222
a quien había dado gran
ocasión a mi pluma para

00:57:32.222 --> 00:57:35.429
escribir donaires;
pero no son todos los tiempos

00:57:35.429 --> 00:57:38.329
unos: tiempo vendrá,
quizá,

00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:41.469
donde, anudando este roto hilo,
diga lo que aquí

00:57:41.469 --> 00:57:43.112
me falta,
y lo que sé

00:57:43.112 --> 00:57:44.050
convenía.
 

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.429
Adiós, gracias;
adiós, donaires;

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:48.059
adiós,
regocijados amigos;

00:57:48.059 --> 00:57:50.623
que yo me voy muriendo,
y deseando veros presto

00:57:50.623 --> 00:57:52.518
contentos en la otra vida."
 

00:57:52.518 --> 00:57:57.335
Which goes, in English,
I hope without an interruption

00:57:57.335 --> 00:57:59.969
like the one we had before.
 

00:57:59.969 --> 00:58:03.806
You catch the setting,
he's going into Madrid,

00:58:03.806 --> 00:58:08.070
where the court is,
this is what he alludes to:

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.434
"It so happens dearest
reader as two friends and I were

00:58:11.434 --> 00:58:14.798
coming from the famous town of
Esquivias [which is where his

00:58:14.798 --> 00:58:17.251
wife was from]
famous for a thousand reasons

00:58:17.251 --> 00:58:20.275
one of them being its
illustrious families and another

00:58:20.275 --> 00:58:23.811
its even more illustrious wines
that I perceived someone behind

00:58:23.811 --> 00:58:26.719
me sparing his mount on in a
great hurry.

00:58:26.719 --> 00:58:29.773
He apparently wanted to
overtake us and soon made that

00:58:29.773 --> 00:58:33.059
clear by calling out for us not
to spur on so urgently.

00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:37.240
We waited for him,
and on a she-ass up came a drab

00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.047
student,
drab because he came dressed

00:58:40.047 --> 00:58:42.449
all in rustic brown with
leggings,

00:58:42.449 --> 00:58:45.425
round toed shoes,
a sword in a chapped scabbard

00:58:45.425 --> 00:58:48.659
and a starch laced collar with
is matching ties.

00:58:48.659 --> 00:58:51.612
The fact of the matter is that
he only had two of these ties to

00:58:51.612 --> 00:58:53.632
hold it on,
so every other minute the

00:58:53.632 --> 00:58:56.934
collar kept falling over to one
side and he was at great pains

00:58:56.934 --> 00:58:58.179
to keep it straight.
 

00:58:58.179 --> 00:59:01.436
Catching up to us he said,
'You sirs must be on your way

00:59:01.436 --> 00:59:04.693
to court to obtain some office
or benefits from his most

00:59:04.693 --> 00:59:08.068
illustrious grace of Toledo and
his majesty themselves are

00:59:08.068 --> 00:59:11.362
doubtless there,
judging by the hurry with which

00:59:11.362 --> 00:59:14.737
you are traveling,
since even my ass,

00:59:14.737 --> 00:59:21.710
which has been praised more
than once for her speed couldn't

00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:23.719
catch to you.'
 

00:59:23.719 --> 00:59:27.157
To this, one of my companions
replied, 'It's the fault of

00:59:27.157 --> 00:59:29.427
Señor Miguel de
Cervantes' nag,

00:59:29.427 --> 00:59:31.699
which is somewhat
long-stepping.'

00:59:31.699 --> 00:59:34.811
Scarcely had the student heard
the name Cervantes when he

00:59:34.811 --> 00:59:38.313
dismounted from his pack animal
sending his saddlebags flying in

00:59:38.313 --> 00:59:40.760
one direction and his valise in
another.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.768
He traveled so completely
outfitted and rushed up to me,

00:59:44.768 --> 00:59:46.579
seizing my left hand and
saying, 'Yes,

00:59:46.579 --> 00:59:49.934
yes, this is the complete
cripple, the completely famous

00:59:49.934 --> 00:59:53.349
and comic writer and lastly the
delight of the muses.'

00:59:53.349 --> 00:59:57.802
I, who in so short a space of
time saw such great complements

00:59:57.802 --> 01:00:00.788
in my praise,
felt it would have been

01:00:00.788 --> 01:00:03.760
discourteous not to respond to
them,

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.260
and so, embracing him around
the neck,

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:07.329
where by I destroyed his collar
all together,

01:00:07.329 --> 01:00:10.101
I said to him,
'That is an error into which

01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:13.070
many of my uninformed admirers
have fallen.

01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.775
I sir, am Cervantes,
but not the delight of the

01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:19.010
muses or any other foolish
things that you mentioned.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:21.536
Round up your ass,
mount up, and let's pass the

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:24.780
brief remainder of our journey
in pleasant conversation.'

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:27.329
The obliging student did just
that;

01:00:27.329 --> 01:00:30.972
we reigned in slightly and then
resumed our trip at a more

01:00:30.972 --> 01:00:32.059
leisurely pace.
 

01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:34.760
As we traveled,
we talked about my illness,

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:37.483
and the good student
immediately diagnosed me a

01:00:37.483 --> 01:00:40.072
hopeless case,
saying, 'This sickness is

01:00:40.072 --> 01:00:43.806
dropsy incurable even if you
were to drink all of the waters

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.769
of the ocean sea made sweet.
 

01:00:45.769 --> 01:00:48.992
Señor Cervantes, sir,
you should limit your drinking

01:00:48.992 --> 01:00:51.849
and don't forget to eat,
for thereby you will recovery

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.440
without any other medicine.'
 

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.559
'That's what many have told
me', I replied,

01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:58.588
'but I just can't give up the
pleasure of drinking all I want

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:00.659
for it almost seems I was born
to it.

01:01:00.659 --> 01:01:04.237
My life's race is slowing at
the rate of my pulse,

01:01:04.237 --> 01:01:08.036
and by this Sunday at the
latest it will complete its

01:01:08.036 --> 01:01:10.300
course and with it my life.
 

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:12.840
You sir, have made my
acquaintance at a difficult

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.648
moment, for there isn't enough
time left to express my

01:01:15.648 --> 01:01:18.190
gratitude for the goodwill
you've shown me.'

01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:20.231
At this point,
we arrived at the Toledo

01:01:20.231 --> 01:01:23.670
bridge, where I crossed into the
city and he road off to enter by

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:24.800
the Segovia road.
 

01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.376
As to what may be said of this
incident fame will take care to

01:01:28.376 --> 01:01:30.806
report it,
my friends will take pleasure

01:01:30.806 --> 01:01:33.909
in telling it and I even more
pleasure in hearing it.

01:01:33.909 --> 01:01:37.577
Once again, we embraced each
other, he spurred his mount and

01:01:37.577 --> 01:01:40.932
left me just as ill at ease as
he was in trying to be a

01:01:40.932 --> 01:01:42.550
gentleman on that ass.
 

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:45.628
He had afforded my pen a great
opportunity to be witty,

01:01:45.628 --> 01:01:49.219
but you can't always make one
moment what you can of another.

01:01:49.219 --> 01:01:52.813
The time had come perhaps when
I shall tie up this broken

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:56.534
thread and say what I fail to
hear and what would have been

01:01:56.534 --> 01:01:58.335
fitting,
goodbye humor,

01:01:58.335 --> 01:02:00.889
goodbye wit,
goodbye merry friends,

01:02:00.889 --> 01:02:04.945
for I am dying and hope to see
you soon happy in the life to

01:02:04.945 --> 01:02:05.840
come."
 

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:13.289
Here we find the same Cervantes
of the Quixote prologues.

01:02:13.289 --> 01:02:17.980
These are the five points that
I want to make.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:22.260
One, the prologue as dialogue,
as in Part I,

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.652
and throughout Cervantes' work,
instead of an expository piece

01:02:26.652 --> 01:02:30.335
in the first person,
he needs to create another to

01:02:30.335 --> 01:02:32.570
tell the story of his own self.
 

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:34.389
Why?
 

01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:38.989
Do these dialogues reflect
those going on in his own mind?

01:02:38.989 --> 01:02:43.014
They do reflect his ironic
stance before his own sense of

01:02:43.014 --> 01:02:46.275
self,
and before his own sense of the

01:02:46.275 --> 01:02:48.530
truth,
because it is sort of this

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.510
perspectivism that we have seen.
 

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:54.965
Two, here, as so many times in
the Quixote,

01:02:54.965 --> 01:02:59.693
we have another student,
with hilarious details about

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:01.239
his clothing.
 

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:05.429
Students are seekers of
knowledge, readers which are of

01:03:05.429 --> 01:03:09.000
great interest to Cervantes,
as we all know.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.748
The details,
as all details in Cervantes,

01:03:11.748 --> 01:03:14.840
are revealing of character,
of personality.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.554
This is a very economical way
of talking about this guy's

01:03:18.554 --> 01:03:22.269
personality by showing his
vanity with all of his clothes

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:23.730
that he's wearing.
 

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:30.199
Three, the scene takes place on
the road, symbol of time and of

01:03:30.199 --> 01:03:33.539
life as in the Quixote.
 

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:36.702
Four--and I think this is the
subtlest and this is why I

01:03:36.702 --> 01:03:40.268
wanted you to hear it in my
interrupted reading in Spanish--

01:03:40.268 --> 01:03:45.384
the rhythm of prose,
and of the story itself seems

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:49.349
to echo that of the trotting
horses;

01:03:49.349 --> 01:03:53.333
this trotting of the horses and
the various paces that the

01:03:53.333 --> 01:03:58.643
horses follow are marking time,
and time, its fleetingness is

01:03:58.643 --> 01:04:04.815
the theme of the piece life's
race and life's journey coalesce

01:04:04.815 --> 01:04:10.378
as death approaches and is
marked by the trotting of the

01:04:10.378 --> 01:04:14.730
horses and by the rhythm of the
prose.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:19.331
Five, Cervantes deals
ironically with his late fame,

01:04:19.331 --> 01:04:22.489
which comes when he's near
death.

01:04:22.489 --> 01:04:26.074
It's something out of rhythm
because now it is of little

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:28.159
consolation or profit for him.
 

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:32.978
So we have here the same self
deprecating Cervantes that we

01:04:32.978 --> 01:04:34.889
have learned to love.
 

01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:39.260
Now, it is in that same spirit
that I ask him,

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:44.893
or wherever he happens to be,
and I ask you forgiveness for

01:04:44.893 --> 01:04:49.460
my own shortcomings in
commenting his work.

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:51.789
Thank you very much.
 

01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:59.000

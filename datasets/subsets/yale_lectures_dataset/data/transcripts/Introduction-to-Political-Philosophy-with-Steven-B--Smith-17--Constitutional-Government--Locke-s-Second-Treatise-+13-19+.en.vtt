00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.280
Professor Steven Smith:
I want to look at two sets of

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.928
issues.
I want to in,

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:10.209
a way, conclude my
interpretation,

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.250
my reading of the Second
Treatise,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.458
by focusing on the role of
executive power in Locke's

00:00:17.458 --> 00:00:20.752
theory of government,
Locke's theory of the

00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:24.094
constitutional state,
particularly focusing on the

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:27.908
role of the executive,
vis-a-vis the legislative

00:00:27.908 --> 00:00:31.787
branch of government,
and then I want to turn a

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:36.509
little more speculatively to
thinking about Locke and the

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:42.160
American regime and the current
state of political philosophy,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.240
modern contemporary American
political philosophy.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.623
But let me start first by going
back and sticking with the

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:53.888
Second Treatise by
talking a little bit about the

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:56.500
role of legislative and
executive power.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.478
The last time,
I think, I was concluding by

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:05.119
arguing that Locke doesn't
endorse necessarily one

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.760
particular form of government
from any other.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.254
He is an advocate of what we
have come to call limited

00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:16.090
government, of constitutional
government.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.273
There is that important passage
where he ridicules the Hobbesian

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:26.538
sovereign as a lion and tells us
we did not enter into the social

00:01:26.538 --> 00:01:31.953
compact to be devoured by lions.
He says, the form of government

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:36.384
must be limited although he's
relatively open or at least

00:01:36.384 --> 00:01:40.256
non-committal,
agnostic you might say,

00:01:40.256 --> 00:01:46.080
as to what particular form that
government may take.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.608
One feature of this form of
government that he thinks is

00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:54.230
very important,
is that it must in some sense

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.760
embody a separation of powers,
powers must be made to check

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.415
one another, what he calls in
the book the subordination of

00:02:05.415 --> 00:02:07.685
powers.
This is Locke's doctrine and

00:02:07.685 --> 00:02:10.508
you will see it there.
We often associate it with

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:14.430
Montesquieu or sometimes with
the federalist authors but,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.195
in fact, Locke himself is a
strong advocate of what he calls

00:02:19.195 --> 00:02:22.750
the subordination or separation
of powers,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.569
not exactly the same as we'll
see between our understanding of

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.099
executive legislative and
judicial,

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.110
but nevertheless a separation
nonetheless.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.838
However, in the first instance,
Locke emphasizes and in fact he

00:02:42.838 --> 00:02:48.196
continually affirms nevertheless
the primacy of legislative

00:02:48.196 --> 00:02:52.027
authority.
In England, in the England at

00:02:52.027 --> 00:02:56.665
his time and even today,
that means a doctrine of what

00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:01.303
is called parliamentary
supremacy but he says that the

00:03:01.303 --> 00:03:06.554
first and fundamental positive
law of all constitutions is in

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:10.930
establishing that of the
legislative power.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.435
The first act,
after the completion of the

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.125
social contract,
he says, is establishing the

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:20.069
legislative power.
It is the lawmaking authority

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:25.000
of government that is supreme,
he wishes to emphasize.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.584
This seems to push Locke,
you might, say more in the

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.729
small â€˜d' democratic
direction.

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.899
It is not so much executive
power, the power of a prince,

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:43.530
but rather the legislature,
the parliament that is supreme.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.974
There is nothing more
important, in Locke's theory of

00:03:46.974 --> 00:03:51.033
constitutional government,
than the existence of what he

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:54.680
continually refers to as settled
or known laws,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.590
settled laws that serve against
arbitrary rule.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.193
In many ways,
the purpose of government for

00:04:03.193 --> 00:04:08.170
Locke is much less to offset the
dangers of returning to an

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.318
anarchic state of nature as it
was for Hobbes than to prevent

00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:19.410
the possibility of the emergence
of tyrannical or despotic power,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.454
tyrannical or despotic
sovereign, and of course,

00:04:23.454 --> 00:04:28.532
Locke's writing is very much
bound up with the big and major

00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:33.438
constitutional crisis of his
time leading to the overthrow

00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:39.269
and expulsion of a king,
James II.

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:42.497
Yet in many ways,
even though Locke is the great

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:44.970
advocate of legislative
supremacy,

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.185
he obviously cannot and does
not wish to dispense altogether

00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:53.279
with the role of executive
power.

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:58.867
He often treats the executive,
whether that be in the form of

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:04.176
a prince, a monarch or perhaps
even a body in a cabinet of

00:05:04.176 --> 00:05:09.002
chief officers as it were.
He treats them often simply as

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:12.323
if they were an agent of the
legislative or of the

00:05:12.323 --> 00:05:15.355
legislature.
The purpose of the executive,

00:05:15.355 --> 00:05:19.385
he sometimes seems to write,
is merely that of carrying out

00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:23.341
the will of the legislature.
In Locke's language,

00:05:23.341 --> 00:05:28.116
"the executive power is
ministerial and subordinate to

00:05:28.116 --> 00:05:32.079
the legislature," section 153,
I believe.

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:35.977
The executive,
again, on some aspects of

00:05:35.977 --> 00:05:41.473
Locke's writing seems to be
little more than a cipher in

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:47.069
comparison to the doctrine of
legislative supremacy.

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:51.010
And yet, Locke here is not
altogether consistent,

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.786
one has to say,
because he understands in every

00:05:54.786 --> 00:05:59.958
community there is a need for a
distinctive branch of government

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:03.569
dealing with matters of war and
peace.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.790
Locke calls this the federative
power.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.597
Every community,
he says, like Hobbes,

00:06:09.597 --> 00:06:13.694
is to every other community
what every individual is to

00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:17.487
every other individual in the
state of nature and a

00:06:17.487 --> 00:06:21.432
distinctive federative or
war-making power within the

00:06:21.432 --> 00:06:25.226
government is necessary for
dealing with matters of

00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:29.370
international conflict,
conflict between states.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.990
And in a remarkable passage,
Locke notes that this power,

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.529
he says, cannot be bound by
antecedent standing positive

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.279
laws but it must be left to,
quote, "the prudence and wisdom

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:47.769
of those whose hands it is in to
be managed for the public good."

00:06:47.769 --> 00:06:50.792
In other words,
Locke seems to suggest that

00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:54.389
this particular kind,
this branch of government,

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:58.420
this federative branch which
falls to some degree under the

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.728
executive, must have a certain
latitude even apart from the law

00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:05.768
that relies,
he says, on the prudence and

00:07:05.768 --> 00:07:09.626
wisdom of those whose hands it
is in to manage it for the

00:07:09.626 --> 00:07:11.945
public good.
In other words,

00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:17.343
matters of war and peace cannot
be left to the legislature or to

00:07:17.343 --> 00:07:20.448
standing laws,
as he calls them,

00:07:20.448 --> 00:07:25.586
alone but requires the
intervention of strong leaders,

00:07:25.586 --> 00:07:30.919
what he calls in an absolutely
stunning passage god-like

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:34.449
princes,
section--if you don't believe

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:38.230
me, section 166.
Locke's reference here to

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.818
god-like princes seems to recall
Machiavelli in many ways,

00:07:43.818 --> 00:07:47.740
Machiavelli's talk of armed
prophets.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.498
It is necessary,
in extreme situations,

00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:56.839
for such princes to call on
their prerogative power.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.277
It is impossible,
Locke writes,

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:03.909
to foresee and so by laws to
provide for all the accidents

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:09.110
and necessities that may concern
the public and that during,

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.555
in other words,
contingencies or emergency

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:17.850
situations the executive must be
empowered with this prerogative

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.800
power to act for the good of the
community.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.756
For this reason it seems,
the executive is not simply a

00:08:25.756 --> 00:08:29.420
tool or an agent of the
legislature but he says,

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:33.488
again, must have the power to
act according to discretion,

00:08:33.488 --> 00:08:36.772
that is to say,
according to his own discretion

00:08:36.772 --> 00:08:40.770
for the public good without the
prescription of law,

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:46.242
those are Locke's own words.
How to balance his argument for

00:08:46.242 --> 00:08:51.203
constitutional government and
legislative supremacy with this

00:08:51.203 --> 00:08:56.081
doctrine of prerogative power
and what seems to be a kind of

00:08:56.081 --> 00:09:00.628
power of what he calls in no
uncertain term the god-like

00:09:00.628 --> 00:09:05.009
princes and their need to
exercise this power?

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:07.729
Locke's prerogative is,
in many ways,

00:09:07.729 --> 00:09:11.884
the result of simply the
inability of law to foresee all

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:16.039
possible circumstances,
all possible contingencies.

00:09:16.039 --> 00:09:19.404
That's an argument that goes as
far back as Aristotle,

00:09:19.404 --> 00:09:22.202
we've seen.
Our inability to make rules

00:09:22.202 --> 00:09:26.514
that can apply to all possible
events, makes it necessary to

00:09:26.514 --> 00:09:31.044
leave some discretionary power
in the hands of the executive to

00:09:31.044 --> 00:09:35.688
act for the public safety.
One of the examples that Locke

00:09:35.688 --> 00:09:39.970
gives of the use of this power
is in fact a domestic,

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.756
not an international issue,
which is to say,

00:09:43.756 --> 00:09:49.039
in the case of a fire in a city
it is sometimes necessary,

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:53.545
he says, in his day for the
fire department to tear down the

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:58.202
house of an innocent person to
prevent the fire from spreading

00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:01.818
to other houses.
This is acting for the public

00:10:01.818 --> 00:10:05.419
good of the community,
even while in some ways it's

00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:09.379
clearly a violation of rights of
property and so on.

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:13.665
He understands this as a piece
of prerogative power acting for

00:10:13.665 --> 00:10:16.332
the public good.
In fact, the example is not so

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:18.991
far fetched.
Think today for example about

00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:22.010
arguments we have today.
Even in Connecticut,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:25.949
there's a big argument going on
about the right of what's called

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:30.481
"eminent domain,"
the right of the government to

00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:36.169
absorb or to take over private
properties whenever,

00:10:36.169 --> 00:10:40.993
usually for things like schools
or airports but also for general

00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:45.970
improvement when it is thought
it will enhance the public good.

00:10:45.970 --> 00:10:49.697
There's a big debate going on
right now out in New London and

00:10:49.697 --> 00:10:53.113
in Brooklyn also with the
argument about the creation of

00:10:53.113 --> 00:10:55.853
some civic center,
some sports arena that will

00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:58.649
require the demolition of
certain neighborhood houses.

00:10:58.649 --> 00:11:01.600
And there's a big debate about
this eminent domain.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.897
What is that,
but in a way Locke's example of

00:11:04.897 --> 00:11:08.570
prerogative power,
acting, doing something that is

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.842
somehow said to be for the
public good but that represents

00:11:12.842 --> 00:11:16.289
some kind of extra
constitutional power?

00:11:16.289 --> 00:11:19.747
But the question for Locke,
as for any constitutional

00:11:19.747 --> 00:11:23.669
lawyer, is what are the limits
of this prerogative power?

00:11:23.669 --> 00:11:28.743
What check, if any,
is there on this power to

00:11:28.743 --> 00:11:34.260
prevent their abuse?
Well, Locke doesn't exactly say.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.340
Yes.
Right.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.749
He doesn't exactly say.
He raises this question to be

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:44.700
sure, of fundamental importance
for constitutional government.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.811
Does executive authority,
he asked us,

00:11:47.811 --> 00:11:52.690
extend to all things even or
especially in times of war?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:58.378
Think about the debates that
are going on now about detainees

00:11:58.378 --> 00:12:04.256
at Guantanamo or the issues of
domestic spying when it comes to

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:09.203
issues of the war on terror.
Are these examples of

00:12:09.203 --> 00:12:12.209
prerogative power,
that is to say,

00:12:12.209 --> 00:12:17.220
the executive acting outside
the limits or the bounds of

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:22.777
constitutional authority for the
sake of protecting the public

00:12:22.777 --> 00:12:28.789
good or are these examples of
kind of political absolutism?

00:12:28.789 --> 00:12:32.942
Is the invocation of this
power, in some ways,

00:12:32.942 --> 00:12:38.480
going down the slippery slope
to despotism and absolutism?

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.468
I will leave it to you or your
sections to try to discuss these

00:12:43.468 --> 00:12:47.892
matters but Locke himself
praises those who he calls the

00:12:47.892 --> 00:12:52.478
wisest and best princes of
England as being those who have

00:12:52.478 --> 00:12:56.420
exercised the largest
prerogative on behalf of the

00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.730
public good.
This is beginning to sound more

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.435
and more in respects like
Machiavelli than the advocate

00:13:05.435 --> 00:13:10.942
of, again, limited government.
This power comes into play,

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:16.110
he says, especially during
times of national crisis or

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:22.057
emergency when it is necessary
to act for the public safety in

00:13:22.057 --> 00:13:25.710
some ways.
And again, this seems to have

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:30.394
special resonance for us today
as we face issues like states of

00:13:30.394 --> 00:13:33.190
emergency and states of
exception.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:38.133
There are in fact political
theorists, one name comes to

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:43.885
mind, a twentieth-century German
legal philosopher by the name of

00:13:43.885 --> 00:13:49.008
Carl Schmitt who argued that the
state of emergency or the

00:13:49.008 --> 00:13:54.401
exceptional situation is the
essence of politics and that the

00:13:54.401 --> 00:14:00.154
person or body who has the power
to declare the exception is none

00:14:00.154 --> 00:14:05.675
other than the sovereign.
So from Schmitt's point of view

00:14:05.675 --> 00:14:09.967
you might say this idea of
prerogative is a kind of extra

00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:14.258
constitutional power that the
statesman must of necessity

00:14:14.258 --> 00:14:18.320
utilize when ordinary
constitutional operations,

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.410
like the rule of law,
prove to be inadequate.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:30.625
But consider another example if
you like, that prerogative

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:35.454
power, about prerogative powers
that maybe granted by the

00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:39.212
Constitution.
Consider Lincoln's famous

00:14:39.212 --> 00:14:44.440
suspension of habeas
corpus during the Civil War.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.008
Lincoln, interestingly,
did not take this extraordinary

00:14:49.008 --> 00:14:53.577
step by appealing to an
extra-constitutional power that

00:14:53.577 --> 00:14:58.493
obtains in times of crisis.
Rather, Lincoln argued quite

00:14:58.493 --> 00:15:03.079
forcefully that this sort of
prerogative power is already

00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:07.419
deeply embedded within the
structure of constitutional

00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:09.595
government.
He cites the

00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:14.069
Constitution when it came
to the suspension of habeas

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:17.567
corpus.
The Constitution writes,

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:21.979
"The privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus shall not be

00:15:21.979 --> 00:15:26.632
suspended unless when in cases
of rebellion or invasion the

00:15:26.632 --> 00:15:30.483
public safety requires it."
In other words,

00:15:30.483 --> 00:15:35.020
the Constitution itself
seems to allow for this

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:40.241
extraordinary kind of action at
least in cases of rebellion or

00:15:40.241 --> 00:15:45.120
invasion when it says the public
safety requires it.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.803
The Constitution seems
to embody within itself,

00:15:48.803 --> 00:15:52.920
our constitution that is,
this Lockean power of

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.895
prerogative that comes into
effect or can be legitimately

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:03.909
exercised in times of rebellion
or invasion.

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:07.960
Are we living in that kind of
age now, not rebellion perhaps

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.299
but invasion?
Well, think about that again.

00:16:12.299 --> 00:16:18.678
Are these arguments applicable
to our situation today,

00:16:18.678 --> 00:16:23.973
in some sense,
when it comes to debates about

00:16:23.973 --> 00:16:31.314
the extent of executive power to
embark on these extraordinary

00:16:31.314 --> 00:16:35.455
measures?
And yet at the same time,

00:16:35.455 --> 00:16:41.058
Locke is aware clearly of the
potential abuse of this kind of

00:16:41.058 --> 00:16:44.510
prerogative.
He asks, who will judge,

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:49.208
who can judge whether the
discretion of the executive is

00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:54.675
being used for the public safety
or the public good or whether it

00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:58.519
is simply a kind of usurpation
of power?

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:03.325
In these moments of high
constitutional crisis between

00:17:03.325 --> 00:17:07.587
conflicting powers of
government, in such cases,

00:17:07.587 --> 00:17:11.940
Locke says there shall be no
judge on earth.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:16.658
He says the people have no
other remedy in this but to

00:17:16.658 --> 00:17:20.849
appeal to Heaven.
This is in section 168.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:26.289
How much is contained in that
term "appeal to Heaven?"

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:30.466
What does Locke mean in terms
of high constitutional crisis

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:34.931
when he says there is no judge
on earth, the people must appeal

00:17:34.931 --> 00:17:38.566
to Heaven?
Does that mean they should fall

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:43.650
down on their knees and begin to
pray, what they should do?

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.943
Unlikely.
By an appeal to Heaven,

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:56.059
Locke means the people's right
to dissolve their government.

00:17:56.059 --> 00:17:59.859
He raises this question at the
very end of the book.

00:17:59.859 --> 00:18:04.232
When a conflict between the
people or their representatives

00:18:04.232 --> 00:18:08.604
and the executive becomes so
great that the very conditions

00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:11.620
of social trust have been
dissolved,

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.539
who will be judge?
And he answers emphatically:

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:20.785
the people will be judge.
Locke affirms here a right of

00:18:20.785 --> 00:18:23.826
revolution.
An appeal to Heaven,

00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:28.575
or what he calls an appeal to
Heaven really refers to an

00:18:28.575 --> 00:18:31.734
appeal to arms,
to rebellion,

00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:37.410
and the need to create a new
social covenant.

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.344
Locke, you can see,
is attempting to hold together

00:18:41.344 --> 00:18:45.519
a belief in the sanctity of law
and the necessity for

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:50.417
prerogative that may sometimes
have to circumvent the rules of

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:53.408
law.
Are these two doctrines

00:18:53.408 --> 00:18:56.978
incompatible?
I think in many respects or at

00:18:56.978 --> 00:19:01.323
least in some respects they are.
Can the prerogative power of

00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:04.955
the executive be in a way
constitutionalized so that it

00:19:04.955 --> 00:19:08.519
does not threaten the liberty of
its own citizens?

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:14.164
Locke alerts us to this
timeless as well as this very

00:19:14.164 --> 00:19:18.503
timely problem.
One of the best sources for

00:19:18.503 --> 00:19:23.859
thinking about many of these
constitutional issues today,

00:19:23.859 --> 00:19:29.255
regarding privacy rights and
other kinds of citizen rights,

00:19:29.255 --> 00:19:32.309
can be found in,
I would say the last five

00:19:32.309 --> 00:19:35.070
chapters or so of Locke's
Second Treatise.

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:41.839
I can't think of a better
source.

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:46.284
So in the end Locke's appeal to
Heaven or Locke says the people

00:19:46.284 --> 00:19:50.518
have an appeal to Heaven,
that is to say an appeal to

00:19:50.518 --> 00:19:55.709
arms, an appeal to revolution,
suggests that at the end of the

00:19:55.709 --> 00:20:00.731
day Locke was a revolutionary
but I would say also a sort of

00:20:00.731 --> 00:20:05.742
cautious and moderate one,
if this is not a complete

00:20:05.742 --> 00:20:10.672
contradiction in terms.
I won't go through chapter 19,

00:20:10.672 --> 00:20:14.208
the famous chapter on
revolution in full,

00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:19.070
to talk about the conditions
under which he believed the

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:22.960
people can rightfully appeal to
Heaven,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.383
as it were, but Locke's
doctrine of consent and

00:20:27.383 --> 00:20:32.191
legislative supremacy,
this should make him in many

00:20:32.191 --> 00:20:36.589
ways a hero to Democrats,
to radical Democrats.

00:20:36.589 --> 00:20:39.901
His beliefs about limited
government, the rights of

00:20:39.901 --> 00:20:43.940
property should make him a hero
to in some ways constitutional

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.589
conservatives and even
libertarians.

00:20:46.589 --> 00:20:51.529
In the end, I think Locke was
neither or both.

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:54.512
Like all of the great thinkers
in some ways,

00:20:54.512 --> 00:20:56.940
he defines--he defies,
excuse me,

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.983
simple classification but there
is no doubt that Locke gave the

00:21:01.983 --> 00:21:07.190
modern constitutional state its
definitive form of expression.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.271
And the problems of our state,
the problems,

00:21:10.271 --> 00:21:14.498
the legal, the constitutional
and political problems that we

00:21:14.498 --> 00:21:17.794
experience are very much
problems rooted in the

00:21:17.794 --> 00:21:21.735
philosophy of John Locke and are
unthinkable without the

00:21:21.735 --> 00:21:25.537
influence of Locke.
So that takes me to a theme

00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:28.581
that I want to talk about for a
little while,

00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:32.039
which is Locke's America,
John Locke's America.

00:21:32.039 --> 00:21:34.348
No one who reads Locke,
even superficially,

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:37.425
and I would not accuse anyone
here of being a superficial

00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:41.847
reader,
after all, but no one can fail

00:21:41.847 --> 00:21:47.700
to be impressed by the harmony,
in many ways,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.374
between Locke's writings and
those of the American Republic

00:21:52.374 --> 00:21:56.491
that he helped to found.
His conception of natural law,

00:21:56.491 --> 00:22:00.600
rights, government by consent,
the right to revolution and all

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.710
are all part of the cornerstone
of our founding documents.

00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:08.427
To some degree,
as I've just been suggesting,

00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:12.735
a judgment on America is very
much a judgment on the

00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:16.029
philosophy of Locke and vice
versa.

00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:18.978
In many ways,
if anyone is,

00:22:18.978 --> 00:22:24.988
I think Locke has the title to
be considered America's

00:22:24.988 --> 00:22:30.318
philosopher-king.
So how should we think of Locke

00:22:30.318 --> 00:22:35.549
after more or less three
centuries of consistent Lockean

00:22:35.549 --> 00:22:39.059
rule?
How should we think of Locke?

00:22:39.059 --> 00:22:42.265
For many years and for many
people, even today,

00:22:42.265 --> 00:22:45.191
the affinity,
the affiliation between Locke

00:22:45.191 --> 00:22:49.860
and America has been regarded in
a largely although not wholly,

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.353
largely positive light.
For many historians and

00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:56.576
political theorists,
our stability,

00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:58.930
our system of limited
government,

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:05.601
our market economy has been the
result of a sort of broad

00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:09.890
consensus over Lockean
principles,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.334
over Lockean first principles.
But for many other readers of

00:23:14.334 --> 00:23:18.563
American history,
this relationship has been seen

00:23:18.563 --> 00:23:21.883
as more problematic.
In the 1950s,

00:23:21.883 --> 00:23:26.657
a book written by a famous
political theorist and

00:23:26.657 --> 00:23:31.612
historian, named Louis Hartz,
a book called The Liberal

00:23:31.612 --> 00:23:34.839
Tradition in America,
complained of America's,

00:23:34.839 --> 00:23:37.569
what he called "irrational
Lockeanism."

00:23:37.569 --> 00:23:41.147
That was Hartz's line,
that was Hartz's quote,

00:23:41.147 --> 00:23:45.757
"irrational Lockeanism," by
which he meant a kind of closed

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:50.526
commitment to Lockean principles
and ideals that shut off all

00:23:50.526 --> 00:23:54.740
other political alternatives and
possibilities.

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:58.395
Hartz was someone very much
interested in the question,

00:23:58.395 --> 00:24:01.509
as many political theorists
have been since,

00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:05.948
why has there been no socialism
in America, why did America not

00:24:05.948 --> 00:24:10.244
evolve or develop along European
lines with social democratic

00:24:10.244 --> 00:24:14.611
parties and socialist parties
like the English Labor Party and

00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:19.296
other kinds of labor movements.
And Hartz's argument was that

00:24:19.296 --> 00:24:23.720
we were sort of arrested in this
Lockean phase of development,

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:29.240
what he called our irrational
Lockeanism that closed off in

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.551
many ways other principles.
And for still other thinkers,

00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:39.039
more or less on the left,
Locke legitimized what was

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:43.000
called an ethic of what was
called "possessive

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.273
individualism,"
particularly Locke's focus on

00:24:47.273 --> 00:24:52.039
property and the rights of
private property that focuses

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:57.413
entirely on market relations or
puts the market values ahead of

00:24:57.413 --> 00:25:00.998
all other things.
And for still others,

00:25:00.998 --> 00:25:05.233
in many ways more recently,
thinkers of a more sort of

00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:09.781
communitarian direction or bent,
Locke's emphasis upon rights

00:25:09.781 --> 00:25:12.845
and the protection,
that government should protect

00:25:12.845 --> 00:25:15.410
natural or certain unalienable
rights,

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.690
suggests a purely or overly
legalistic conception of

00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:24.474
politics that has no language
for talking about the common

00:25:24.474 --> 00:25:27.298
good,
the public good or other sort

00:25:27.298 --> 00:25:32.045
of collective goods or benefit.
So my point is that Locke's

00:25:32.045 --> 00:25:37.160
influence has not been
altogether accepted by everyone.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:42.211
There has been much ground for
criticism of this peculiar

00:25:42.211 --> 00:25:46.000
affinity between Lockeanism and
America.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.737
But today, I would say that
Locke's theory of liberalism or

00:25:49.737 --> 00:25:52.250
Locke's theory of limited
government,

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.436
constitutional government,
is confronted by another

00:25:55.436 --> 00:25:57.539
alternative that,
in many ways,

00:25:57.539 --> 00:26:00.867
has deep roots in the very
tradition which Locke

00:26:00.867 --> 00:26:04.903
himself---the very liberal
tradition in many ways of which

00:26:04.903 --> 00:26:08.497
Locke himself is the founder.
And I am referring,

00:26:08.497 --> 00:26:11.475
in particular,
to a book that many of you will

00:26:11.475 --> 00:26:14.519
read at some point in your Yale
experience,

00:26:14.519 --> 00:26:19.146
a book, widely read and widely
acclaimed book by a recently

00:26:19.146 --> 00:26:23.853
deceased political philosopher
by the name of John Rawls who

00:26:23.853 --> 00:26:28.559
wrote a book in 1973 called A
Theory of Justice.

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:33.018
In many ways,
Rawls' book was an attempt to

00:26:33.018 --> 00:26:37.369
update the liberal theory of the
state.

00:26:37.369 --> 00:26:41.061
He invokes the idea of a state
of nature, an original

00:26:41.061 --> 00:26:45.180
condition, as he calls it,
a theory of rights although he

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:49.299
does so in many ways through the
techniques of contemporary

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:53.346
philosophy and game theory and
Rawls' book is probably the

00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:56.968
single most important
contribution to Anglo-American

00:26:56.968 --> 00:27:00.589
political philosophy in the last
generation.

00:27:00.589 --> 00:27:03.698
It is a book that situates
itself within the liberal

00:27:03.698 --> 00:27:07.314
tradition beginning with Locke,
developed by people like

00:27:07.314 --> 00:27:11.057
Immanuel Kant and John Stuart
Mill in which Rawls himself

00:27:11.057 --> 00:27:12.939
hoped to,
in many ways,

00:27:12.939 --> 00:27:15.680
bring to completion in his
book.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.029
A theory of justice,
as he calls it,

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:22.124
stands or falls on its theory
of rights from which all else is

00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:25.804
derived.
And what I want to do for a few

00:27:25.804 --> 00:27:30.069
minutes is to contrast Rawls'
general theory,

00:27:30.069 --> 00:27:33.674
so powerful and influential
today, from that of John

00:27:33.674 --> 00:27:38.410
Locke's, the original founder of
the liberal theory of the state,

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:43.761
and see how they have diverged.
Consider the following

00:27:43.761 --> 00:27:45.529
propositions,
if you will.

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:48.516
Here is John Locke,
section 27 of the Second

00:27:48.516 --> 00:27:51.968
Treatise.
"Every man has property in his

00:27:51.968 --> 00:27:55.244
own person.
This nobody has any right to

00:27:55.244 --> 00:27:59.406
but himself and where there is
property," he writes,

00:27:59.406 --> 00:28:02.670
"there can be justice and
injustice."

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.942
Here is John Rawls,
one of the opening pages of his

00:28:05.942 --> 00:28:09.809
Theory of Justice.
"Each person," Rawls writes,

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:14.234
"possesses an inviolability
founded on justice that even the

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:17.910
welfare of society as a whole
cannot override.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.591
For this reason," he continues,
"justice denies that the loss

00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:27.039
of freedom for some is made
right by a greater good shared

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.910
to others."
Okay.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:33.450
So far, so good, in other words.
Both of them present their

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.979
theories of justice as justified
in terms of the liberal

00:28:37.979 --> 00:28:42.929
principles of equality,
freedom and the sanctity of the

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:46.009
individual and individual
rights.

00:28:46.009 --> 00:28:49.711
Both regard the purpose of
government, in many ways,

00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:53.848
as securing the conditions of
justice as deriving from the

00:28:53.848 --> 00:28:56.624
consent,
or the informed consent,

00:28:56.624 --> 00:29:00.909
of the governed but both it
seems to me go on to differ

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:05.590
profoundly about the source of
rights and therefore the role

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.589
that government has in securing
the conditions of justice.

00:29:10.589 --> 00:29:12.970
Let me explain a little bit
more what I mean.

00:29:16.799 --> 00:29:21.100
For Locke, going back to
chapter 5 of the Second

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.885
Treatise,
rights derived from a theory of

00:29:24.885 --> 00:29:28.208
self-ownership.
According to his view,

00:29:28.208 --> 00:29:31.968
you will remember,
everybody has a property in his

00:29:31.968 --> 00:29:35.049
or her own person.
That is to say,

00:29:35.049 --> 00:29:40.440
no one has a claim on our
bodies other than ourselves.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.274
It is on the rock of
self-ownership,

00:29:43.274 --> 00:29:47.000
the fact that we have property
in ourselves,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.231
it is on the rock of
self-ownership that Locke builds

00:29:50.231 --> 00:29:54.829
his edifice of natural rights,
justice, and limited government.

00:29:54.829 --> 00:29:58.772
To put it in a slightly
different way perhaps,

00:29:58.772 --> 00:30:03.239
a person has an identity,
what we might call today a

00:30:03.239 --> 00:30:08.583
moral personality or an identity
by the fact that we alone are

00:30:08.583 --> 00:30:12.000
responsible for making
ourselves.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.331
He uses this metaphor of the
work of the body and the labor

00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:18.318
of our hands but we are
literally the products of our

00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:22.045
own making.
We create ourselves through our

00:30:22.045 --> 00:30:26.760
activity and our most
characteristic activity is our

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:30.279
work.
Locke's fundamental doctrine is

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:35.480
that the world is the product of
our own free creativity,

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:40.594
not nature but the self,
the individual is the source of

00:30:40.594 --> 00:30:44.009
all value for Locke.
It is this self,

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:47.432
the I, the me,
the ego that is the unique

00:30:47.432 --> 00:30:52.481
source of rights and the task of
government is to secure the

00:30:52.481 --> 00:30:58.130
conditions of our property in
the broadest sense of the term,

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.099
namely, everything that is
proper to us.

00:31:03.099 --> 00:31:11.900
Now, using that as a sort of
shorthand, contrast this to

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.579
Rawls' idea.
Rawls adds to his idea of

00:31:16.579 --> 00:31:22.631
justice something that he calls
the "difference principle," the

00:31:22.631 --> 00:31:28.779
DP as it's sometimes referred to
in the literature on Rawls.

00:31:28.779 --> 00:31:31.309
What is the difference
principle?

00:31:31.309 --> 00:31:36.426
This principle maintains that
our natural endowments,

00:31:36.426 --> 00:31:39.279
our talents,
our abilities,

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:41.802
our family backgrounds,
our history,

00:31:41.802 --> 00:31:45.190
our unique histories,
our place, so to speak,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:49.207
in the social hierarchy,
all of these things are from a

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:53.150
moral point of view something
completely arbitrary.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.960
None of these are ours in any
strong sense of the term.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:03.043
They do not belong to us but
are the result of a more or less

00:32:03.043 --> 00:32:07.448
kind of random or arbitrary
genetic lottery or social

00:32:07.448 --> 00:32:13.210
lottery of which I or you happen
to be the unique beneficiaries.

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.336
The result of this,
in other words,

00:32:16.336 --> 00:32:21.577
is that no longer can I be
regarded as the sole proprietor

00:32:21.577 --> 00:32:26.726
of my assets or the unique
recipient of the advantages or

00:32:26.726 --> 00:32:30.680
disadvantages I may accrue from
them.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.314
Fortune, luck,
Machiavellian fortuna,

00:32:34.314 --> 00:32:38.539
in that way, is utterly
arbitrary and therefore,

00:32:38.539 --> 00:32:42.370
Rawls concludes,
I should not be regarded as the

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:46.690
possessor but merely the
recipient of what talents,

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:52.330
capacities and abilities that I
may, again, purely arbitrarily

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:57.657
happen to possess.
So what does that mean in terms

00:32:57.657 --> 00:33:02.369
of social policy or theory of
government?

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:07.356
The result of Rawls' difference
principle and its fundamental

00:33:07.356 --> 00:33:12.342
difference with that of John
Locke could not be more striking

00:33:12.342 --> 00:33:17.265
from this point of view.
The Lockean theory of justice,

00:33:17.265 --> 00:33:20.638
broadly speaking,
supports a meritocracy

00:33:20.638 --> 00:33:25.309
sometimes referred to as
"equality of opportunity,"

00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:29.987
that is, what a person does
with his or her natural assets

00:33:29.987 --> 00:33:34.561
belongs exclusively to them,
the right to rise or fall

00:33:34.561 --> 00:33:39.318
belongs exclusively to them.
No one has the moral right to

00:33:39.318 --> 00:33:43.536
interfere with the products of
our labor, the products

00:33:43.536 --> 00:33:48.311
of--which may also include not
just in a primitive sense what

00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:52.609
we do with our hands and bodies
but what we do with our

00:33:52.609 --> 00:33:56.349
intelligence and our natural
endowments.

00:33:56.349 --> 00:34:00.073
For Rawls, again,
on the other hand,

00:34:00.073 --> 00:34:06.029
our endowments are never really
our own to begin with.

00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:11.255
They are part of a common or
collective possession to be

00:34:11.255 --> 00:34:17.556
shared by society as a whole,
the capacities of hard work,

00:34:17.556 --> 00:34:23.309
ambition, intelligence and just
good luck that,

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:26.485
for example,
got you to a place like Yale,

00:34:26.485 --> 00:34:30.202
on Rawls' account,
do not really belong to you or

00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:34.694
at least the fruits of those
ambitions and intelligence and

00:34:34.694 --> 00:34:39.453
good luck do not belong to you.
Again they are somewhat

00:34:39.453 --> 00:34:43.570
arbitrary as a result of
upbringing and genetics.

00:34:43.570 --> 00:34:47.697
They're not yours or mine,
in any strong sense of the

00:34:47.697 --> 00:34:51.269
term, but rather,
a collective possession that

00:34:51.269 --> 00:34:56.110
can be or should be the fruits
of which distributed to society

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.688
as a whole.
Consider the following passage

00:34:59.688 --> 00:35:03.414
from Rawls.
"The difference principle," he

00:35:03.414 --> 00:35:08.609
writes, "represents in effect an
agreement to regard the

00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:14.372
distribution of natural talents
as a common asset and to share

00:35:14.372 --> 00:35:19.379
in the benefits of this
distribution whatever it turns

00:35:19.379 --> 00:35:25.097
out to be."
Your intelligence or your drive

00:35:25.097 --> 00:35:30.928
or your endowments are,
again, what he calls a

00:35:30.928 --> 00:35:36.219
collective asset.
Think about that.

00:35:36.219 --> 00:35:40.864
And it is this conception of
common assets that underwrites

00:35:40.864 --> 00:35:45.829
Rawls' theory of distributive
justice and the welfare state,

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:50.636
just as Locke's theory of
self-ownership justifies his

00:35:50.636 --> 00:35:56.349
conception of limited government
in the constitutional state.

00:35:56.349 --> 00:36:00.353
According to Rawls,
again, justice requires that

00:36:00.353 --> 00:36:04.783
social arrangements be
structured for the benefits of

00:36:04.783 --> 00:36:09.809
the least advantaged in the
genetic lottery of society.

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:14.939
His thought experiment that he
calls "the original condition"

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:20.069
specifies that nobody would know
in advance in this condition

00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:24.430
what their particular endowment
intellectually,

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:29.382
in many other ways, would be.
Therefore, every individual

00:36:29.382 --> 00:36:34.897
would, in contracting with the
whole, would agree to share

00:36:34.897 --> 00:36:41.090
equally in the benefits of this,
as it were, genetic lottery.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:45.032
So redistributing our common
assets does not violate,

00:36:45.032 --> 00:36:48.671
on Rawls' account,
the sanctity of the individual

00:36:48.671 --> 00:36:53.371
because again the fruits of our
labor were never really ours to

00:36:53.371 --> 00:36:55.683
begin with.
Unlike Locke,

00:36:55.683 --> 00:37:00.407
whose theory of self-ownership
provides a moral justification

00:37:00.407 --> 00:37:03.065
for the individual,
for the self,

00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:06.838
for our moral personality,
Rawls' difference principle

00:37:06.838 --> 00:37:11.110
maintains that we never again
belong to ourselves at all.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:16.478
We never really have ownership
in ourselves but are always part

00:37:16.478 --> 00:37:20.555
of a larger social "we,"
a social collective,

00:37:20.555 --> 00:37:25.301
a collective consciousness
whose common assets can be

00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:29.500
redistributed for the benefit of
the whole.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:33.180
Locke and Rawls,
the point I'm trying to make

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.533
is, they represent two radically
different visions of the liberal

00:37:38.533 --> 00:37:41.908
state,
one broadly libertarian,

00:37:41.908 --> 00:37:47.620
the other broadly welfarist,
one emphasizing liberty,

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:53.314
the other emphasizing equality.
Interestingly,

00:37:53.314 --> 00:37:57.292
again, this transition,
this evolution represents a

00:37:57.292 --> 00:38:01.669
change which has gone on within
in many ways the liberal

00:38:01.669 --> 00:38:05.152
tradition itself.
Unlike some of these other

00:38:05.152 --> 00:38:09.084
critics, Rawls does not come to
be claiming from a tradition

00:38:09.084 --> 00:38:13.016
outside of liberalism but to be
developing certain arguments

00:38:13.016 --> 00:38:16.681
from within the liberal
tradition and yet has moved in a

00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:20.880
way clearly very different from
its Lockean formulation.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.974
Both of these views,
again, they begin from common

00:38:23.974 --> 00:38:27.070
premises but move in very
different directions.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:31.095
Locke's theory of
self-ownership regards the

00:38:31.095 --> 00:38:36.900
political community in largely
negative terms as protecting our

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:42.050
antecedent individual selves and
individual rights.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.156
Rawls' theory of common assets
regards the community in a far

00:38:46.156 --> 00:38:50.262
more positive sense as taking an
active role in reshaping and

00:38:50.262 --> 00:38:54.505
redistributing the products of
our individual endeavors for the

00:38:54.505 --> 00:38:58.040
common interests.
The question for you,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.454
just like the question for any
of us, is which of these two

00:39:03.454 --> 00:39:08.869
views is more valid or which of
the two strikes you as more

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:12.577
powerful or plausible?
My own view,

00:39:12.577 --> 00:39:18.314
and I loathe to editorialize,
but my own view is far closer

00:39:18.314 --> 00:39:21.974
to American theory,
to Locke's theory,

00:39:21.974 --> 00:39:26.477
which I think--than Rawls'.
The Declaration of

00:39:26.477 --> 00:39:29.025
Independence,
the charter of American

00:39:29.025 --> 00:39:32.273
liberty, states that each
individual is endowed with

00:39:32.273 --> 00:39:35.139
unalienable rights among which
are life,

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:37.539
liberty, the pursuit of
happiness.

00:39:37.539 --> 00:39:41.287
The very indeterminacy of the
last phrase, the pursuit of

00:39:41.287 --> 00:39:45.169
happiness, with its emphasis
upon the individual's right to

00:39:45.169 --> 00:39:47.780
determine happiness for
themselves,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.135
suggests a form of government
that allows for ample diversity

00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:55.982
for our natural talents and
abilities and although the

00:39:55.982 --> 00:40:00.192
Declaration certainly
intends that the establishment

00:40:00.192 --> 00:40:04.329
of justice is one of the first
tasks of government,

00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:09.983
nowhere does it imply that this
requires the wholesale

00:40:09.983 --> 00:40:15.530
redistribution of our individual
goods and assets.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:19.282
And second, although Rawls is
clearly attractive,

00:40:19.282 --> 00:40:23.737
excuse me, Rawls is clearly
attentive to the moral ills of

00:40:23.737 --> 00:40:28.271
inequality and we will turn to
that problem emphatically on

00:40:28.271 --> 00:40:32.727
Wednesday when we look at
Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Essay

00:40:32.727 --> 00:40:36.496
on Inequality.
There has never been a more

00:40:36.496 --> 00:40:40.097
powerful, passionate and
persuasive critic of the ills of

00:40:40.097 --> 00:40:43.634
inequality than Jean-Jacques
Rousseau but while Rawls is

00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:47.300
certainly attentive to the moral
ills of inequality,

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.766
he seems very naive about the
mechanisms, the actual political

00:40:51.766 --> 00:40:55.719
mechanisms, by which
inequalities will be rectified.

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:59.923
Rawls wants government to work
for the benefit of the least

00:40:59.923 --> 00:41:03.909
advantaged but this will require
the extensive and often

00:41:03.909 --> 00:41:08.402
arbitrary use of judicial power
to determine who has a right to

00:41:08.402 --> 00:41:12.251
what,
far in excess of the powers of

00:41:12.251 --> 00:41:15.005
the court.
The result would be,

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:19.340
I think if we follow Rawls'
teachings to their letter,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.920
the result would be not a class
of philosopher-kings,

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.276
but rather a class of chief
justices endowed with the power

00:41:28.276 --> 00:41:32.633
to rearrange and redistribute
our collective assets for the

00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:37.139
sake of achieving the maximum
degree of social equality.

00:41:37.139 --> 00:41:41.539
It is no surprise that the
warmest reception that Rawls'

00:41:41.539 --> 00:41:45.219
writing gets today is in the
schools of law,

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:49.801
is in the law schools where he
has had an enormous influence on

00:41:49.801 --> 00:41:54.161
shaping the education of the
current and the next generation

00:41:54.161 --> 00:41:58.191
of lawyers,
judges and possibly chief

00:41:58.191 --> 00:42:04.619
justices who may be looking to
again, looking not to the

00:42:04.619 --> 00:42:11.047
Constitution but to
Rawls' theory of justice as a

00:42:11.047 --> 00:42:18.409
litmus or a tool for bringing
about social redistribution.

00:42:18.409 --> 00:42:22.331
So, I leave you on that
sobering note but a return to

00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:25.799
Locke such as it is,
even if such a return were

00:42:25.799 --> 00:42:29.157
possible,
is by no means a panacea to

00:42:29.157 --> 00:42:31.955
what ails us.
I am not suggesting for a

00:42:31.955 --> 00:42:34.710
moment that Locke is some kind
of cure all.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.672
Some historians,
let me just mention again,

00:42:37.672 --> 00:42:41.482
Louis Hartz was but the most
famous, treat America as a

00:42:41.482 --> 00:42:45.079
nation uniquely built upon
Lockean foundations.

00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:49.114
America, he believed,
remained something of a Lockean

00:42:49.114 --> 00:42:51.210
remnant--a Lockean,
yeah,

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:55.481
remnant, fossil in some ways,
in a world increasingly

00:42:55.481 --> 00:42:59.260
governed by more radical forms
of modernity.

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.987
In fact, it has been our sort
of stubborn Lockeanism that has,

00:43:03.987 --> 00:43:07.471
in many ways,
prevented the kinds of extreme

00:43:07.471 --> 00:43:11.340
ideological polarization and
conflict that one sees

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.899
throughout much of the
nineteenth and twentieth

00:43:14.899 --> 00:43:18.383
centuries.
But Locke's effort to build a

00:43:18.383 --> 00:43:22.870
kind of modern republican
government on the low but solid

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:27.758
foundations of self-interest and
self-ownership and the desire

00:43:27.758 --> 00:43:32.485
for comfortable preservation
could not help but generate its

00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:36.535
own forms of dissatisfaction.
Can a regime,

00:43:36.535 --> 00:43:41.644
dedicated to the pursuit of
happiness or to the protection

00:43:41.644 --> 00:43:46.753
of property ever satisfy the
deepest longings of the human

00:43:46.753 --> 00:43:48.458
soul?
Can a regime,

00:43:48.458 --> 00:43:51.816
devoted to the rational
accumulation of property answer

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:55.050
those higher order needs or
higher order virtues,

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:58.449
like honor, nobility and
sacrifice?

00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:01.712
Can a regime,
devoted to the avoidance of

00:44:01.712 --> 00:44:06.198
pain, discomfort and anxiety,
produce anything more than

00:44:06.198 --> 00:44:10.440
contemporary forms of
Epicureanism and Nihilism?

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.898
In any case,
I'm suggesting no more than any

00:44:13.898 --> 00:44:18.241
other land could America
insulate itself from the great

00:44:18.241 --> 00:44:22.423
heights as well as the great
depths of later forms of

00:44:22.423 --> 00:44:26.075
modernity.
America, as a former teacher of

00:44:26.075 --> 00:44:29.203
mine once said,
is the land where the many

00:44:29.203 --> 00:44:33.553
facets, the many faces of
modernity are working themselves

00:44:33.553 --> 00:44:37.603
out.
We are but a moment in the kind

00:44:37.603 --> 00:44:42.376
of comprehensive
self-dissatisfaction that is

00:44:42.376 --> 00:44:47.150
modernity so that a return to
Lockeanism,

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:50.637
in many ways,
is not so much a cure for the

00:44:50.637 --> 00:44:55.142
pathologies of modernity.
I would suggest that those

00:44:55.142 --> 00:44:59.231
pathologies are themselves
already rooted in the

00:44:59.231 --> 00:45:03.620
pathologies of Locke.
I will end on that sober note

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:07.984
and encourage you to take
Rousseau's advice about loving

00:45:07.984 --> 00:45:11.000
one's country seriously on
Tuesday.

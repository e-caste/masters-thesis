00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:03.200
WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So we're
getting started on

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.367
The Sound and the Fury.

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:12.567
And I just want to show you
a few images of Faulkner's

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:15.433
Oxford, Oxford, Mississippi.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:20.833
So this is Rowan Oak,
Faulkner's house.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:28.833
And this is actually the old
Faulkner family house.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:32.633
And you notice that actually
quite a few American authors

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.467
changed the spelling
of the name.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:41.233
So Hawthorne used to be
H-A-T-H-O-R-N-E, so the W

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:42.500
isn't added on.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.100
And likewise, Faulkner used to
be spelled F-A-L-K-N-E-R. So

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.467
it's just an interesting fact.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:49.033
But this is the

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:53.167
Trigg-Doyle-Falkner House in
1904.

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:56.433
And the little boy on the pony,
that's actually Faulkner

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:57.967
right there.

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:05.400
So this is his statue in the
Courthouse Square in Oxford.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.967
And keep this square in mind,
because in fact it will come

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:13.367
back at the very end of The
Sound and the Fury.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:17.600
The Confederate monument in that
square is very important

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.333
to the plot of The Sound
and the Fury.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:25.333
So it is the most important
place in the Central Square in

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:27.100
Oxford, so it's very
important.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.467
And Faulkner is sitting
right there.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.233
And this is an image
of him at work.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.733
And you'll see that he was
a very bookish author,

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:41.000
surrounded by books
as he wrote.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.800
And so we have to keep in mind
that authors are also readers

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.333
as well, and what they
read makes a

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.267
difference to how they write.

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:57.633
So both the creator of his own
writings but also a reader of

00:01:57.633 --> 00:01:59.733
other people's writings.

00:01:59.733 --> 00:02:08.800
And this is the mythic
Yoknapatawpha County--

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.400
I always have trouble
saying this--

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.067
and it's mapped by
Faulkner himself.

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:17.400
And it's obviously completely
made up but very

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.333
much based on Oxford.

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:25.233
And this is Jefferson,
Mississippi,

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.667
in Faulkner's works.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:31.567
So it's just a really
interesting fact of Faulkner's

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:36.233
writings that he should create
not just a mythology but also

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:39.300
a whole landscape that
goes with that.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.667
And talking about Faulkner as
a reader, not just an author

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:49.267
but also a reader, "the sound
and the fury," the phrase, is

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:52.300
taken from Macbeth,
Act V, Scene 5.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.900
And it turns out that there's
another phrase that's also

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.933
very important to him as well.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:57.300
So--

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.633
"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and
tomorrow,/ creeps in this

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.533
petty pace from day to day,/
to the last syllable of

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:11.067
recorded time./ And all our
yesterdays have lighted fools/

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:13.733
the way to dusty death.

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:19.367
Out, out brief candle!/ Life's
but a walking shadow, a poor

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:25.500
player,/ that struts and frets
his hour upon the stage,/ and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.033
then is heard no more.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:32.500
It is a tale/ told by an idiot,
full of sound and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.033
fury,/ signifying nothing."

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:40.600
So the title of the novel is
taken from the phrase "sound

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.167
and fury." But today's Benjy
section is obviously a tale

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:50.000
told by an idiot, and that's
really the challenge that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.200
Faulkner takes upon himself is
to use mental retardation as a

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.333
constraint on narration and to
take up the challenge that

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:05.033
comes from that constraint.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:11.267
And here, I want to read you two
accounts of Faulkner's own

00:04:11.267 --> 00:04:15.400
description of how The Sound
and the Fury began.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.000
And one is much less precise
than the other.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.967
And I'll say a little bit about
your upcoming paper in

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:26.400
that context, but first, let's
look at the two accounts that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.733
Faulkner himself offers.

00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:31.933
"That began as a short story.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:36.600
It was a story without plot,
of some children being sent

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.767
away from the house during the
grandmother's funeral.

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:44.633
They were too young to be told
what was going on, and they

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:49.200
saw things only incidentally
to the childish games they

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.733
were playing."

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:55.533
So this is a fine description.

00:04:55.533 --> 00:04:59.033
It's an OK summary of The
Sound and the Fury.

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.867
It's about children at the
beginning of The Sound and the

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:04.400
Fury being sent away
from the house.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.867
But this strange centrality
given to the grandmother's

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:13.400
funeral and not being able to
figure out what's going on,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.167
that is not not in there.

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:19.333
It is very much in there in The
Sound and the Fury, but

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:23.167
our experience of readingf
Benjy's section isn't really

00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.667
revolving around that
particular event.

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:29.033
So Faulkner obviously
has moved away from

00:05:29.033 --> 00:05:31.133
that initial account.

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:34.867
So let's look at his second
account, much more precise,

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:36.800
much closer to what
we actually see

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.433
in the Benjy section.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:44.333
"And then the idea struck me to
see how much more I could

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:49.500
have got out of the idea of the
blind self-centeredness of

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.800
innocence typified by children,
if one of those

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.467
children had been truly
innocent, that is, an idiot.

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:03.767
So the idiot was born, and then
I became interested in

00:06:03.767 --> 00:06:09.067
the relationship of the idiot
to the world that he was in

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:14.367
but would never be able to cope
with and just where could

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:17.333
he get the tenderness,
the help, to

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:21.000
shield him in his innocence.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.300
I mean 'innocence' in the sense
that God had stricken

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.000
him blind at birth, that
is, mindless at birth."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.433
So I'll come back to this
particular very precise, very,

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:37.733
very good summary of
the Benjy section.

00:06:37.733 --> 00:06:41.933
But I just wanted to stop for
a moment and talk about one

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:45.400
strategy to keep in mind as you
write your papers, because

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.000
this is a writing, WR, class.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.933
So I want to emphasize how
important it is to know

00:06:57.933 --> 00:07:00.967
exactly what you're trying
to do in a paper.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:02.700
That is the most important
thing.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.200
Knowing what you want to say
is just about the most

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.867
important thing, as important
as having something to say.

00:07:09.867 --> 00:07:15.400
So that's why there are two
assignments that accompany the

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.900
first paper.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:20.167
One is the outline in which
you name, you itemize, you

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:23.033
enumerate all the things that
you plan to do in the paper.

00:07:23.033 --> 00:07:25.100
That's very important.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.100
And the other is a more
unusual requirement.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.067
It's a cover page that
accompanies your first paper

00:07:34.067 --> 00:07:38.867
that will both describe what
you're trying to do, the

00:07:38.867 --> 00:07:41.600
problems that you've run into
in the course of writing the

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.833
paper, and what you would
do differently if

00:07:45.833 --> 00:07:46.933
you have more time.

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.867
So it's recognizing the fact
that you guys have constraints

00:07:49.867 --> 00:07:51.833
on you as well, time
constraints.

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:53.267
You just have to turn
the paper in.

00:07:53.267 --> 00:07:57.000
But if you had more time,
what else would you do?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.733
What would you do differently?

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:02.600
This is to cultivate a
self-consciousness about the

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.900
paper as a paper, what goes into
the paper, what you are

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.600
free and able to put into the
paper at one moment and what

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.100
future projects, what future
versions of the paper you

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.967
might want to do.

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:21.967
As well as a recognition of what
you are trying to do that

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:25.300
you haven't quite succeeded
in doing.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.867
So that is as important as well
is realizing that you're

00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:32.700
trying to do something, but
you haven't quite done it.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.300
But knowing that that's
really what you

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.133
should try to achieve.

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:39.267
So that self-awareness of the
slight gap between what you

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:42.800
set out to do and what you've
actually achieved, the

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.267
self-awareness of that gap is
crucial to you on your way to

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:51.333
becoming the writer that
you want to be.

00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:55.800
So recognizing writing as a
process, you can get there

00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:01.200
maybe 3/5 of the way, still
another third or maybe more

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.167
than that, maybe
3/4 of the way.

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:06.700
But you're not completely
there.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.733
But what else do you need to do,
in your own estimation, to

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:12.367
get to be exactly where
you'd like?

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:16.800
So I would just encourage you
to give a lot of thought to

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.333
those two additional
requirements of the first

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:20.533
writing assignment.

00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:26.333
But now let's come back to
Faulkner and this very good,

00:09:26.333 --> 00:09:28.867
very precise account of The
Sound and the Fury.

00:09:28.867 --> 00:09:31.900
And we notice a number
of things.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.433
First of all, that he is
defining idiocy in a very

00:09:35.433 --> 00:09:36.467
peculiar way.

00:09:36.467 --> 00:09:40.267
He is defining idiocy
as the blind

00:09:40.267 --> 00:09:42.633
self-centeredness of innocence.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:46.467
He's not using the word "mental
retardation." That's

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:48.700
very, very important
to keep in mind.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.033
It's not necessarily a
simple deficiency.

00:09:54.033 --> 00:09:56.800
It is blind, so it
has that aspect.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.000
It is self-centered.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.700
And we'll think about what that
means for "idiocy" to be

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.900
a form of self-centeredness.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:11.000
But also, more than anything
else, it is a kind of

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.567
innocence, which is a good
word for most of us.

00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:16.800
So what does it mean
for "idiocy" to

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.767
be a kind of innocence?

00:10:18.767 --> 00:10:20.567
We'll think about that.

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:23.833
And in fact an argument that I
would like to make is that not

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.967
only is Benjy himself innocent,
but innocence is

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:30.567
also what he demands
from the world.

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:35.067
Innocence is the impossible
demand that he puts upon the

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:37.300
person that he loves
the most, Caddy.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:42.333
And it is that impossible demand
that Caddy is not able

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:44.333
to fulfill in the end.

00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:46.233
And what Faulkner
does about that.

00:10:46.233 --> 00:10:51.567
The novel is both about Caddy
not being able to supply that

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:57.200
requisite, that demanded
innocence that is coming from

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.367
Benjy, the demand made upon her,
not being able to fulfill

00:11:01.367 --> 00:11:07.867
it finally, and Faulkner
actually stepping in to supply

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:12.000
that lack by his narrative
experimentation.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.667
So this is what I'll
try to show in the

00:11:15.667 --> 00:11:17.800
course of this lecture.

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.167
But I want to contextualize
Faulkner against a number of

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:27.933
thinkers who also thought about
mental retardation or

00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:31.933
the various ways of designating
that condition.

00:11:31.933 --> 00:11:36.833
And one of the most important is
the philosopher John Locke.

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:40.100
And this is what he says in
a very, very influential--

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.533
this is one of the most
influential texts written in

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:46.867
the end of the 17th century,
very, very influential in the

00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:50.900
18th century and 19th
century as well.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:51.533
John Locke--

00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:56.700
"Herein seems to lie the
difference between idiots and

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:02.700
madmen, that madmen put wrong
ideas together and reason from

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.800
them, but idiots make very few
or no propositions and reason

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.667
scarce at all."

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:15.167
So we almost recognize something
else in what John

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.033
Locke is describing.

00:12:17.033 --> 00:12:21.267
Madmen put wrong ideas together
and reason from them.

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:24.567
Actually, he's describing
a lot of the characters

00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:26.600
in Edgar Allen Poe.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.767
So we recognize that.

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.933
But idiots-- and this is really
a very good description

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:34.733
of what Faulkner is
trying to create--

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:38.800
idiots put very few or
no propositions and

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.167
reason scarce at all.

00:12:41.167 --> 00:12:44.467
So not being able to put the
two and two together, not

00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:47.933
being able to go from
point A to point B,

00:12:47.933 --> 00:12:49.233
that is Benjy's problem.

00:12:49.233 --> 00:12:52.467
So point A and point B are
always going to be completely

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:55.467
separate, discrete,
unconnected dots.

00:12:55.467 --> 00:13:00.200
He's not able to connect all
the dots of the world.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.733
So it really goes back to John
Locke in some sense.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:11.533
And in the 19th century,
the institution--

00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:13.167
well, it was called
a lunatic asylum.

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.867
It's not called by that
designation now.

00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:18.733
"Mental institution"
is the word we use.

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:22.733
But when it first started in the
mid 19th century, it was

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:25.400
called a lunatic asylum.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.400
And this is the one in
Jackson, Mississippi.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.633
And Jackson, Mississippi, is
very resonant and loaded

00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:33.100
within Faulkner.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.833
Sending someone to Jackson just
means sending him to the

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:38.967
lunatic asylum.

00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:41.233
And it comes up in The
Sound and the Fury.

00:13:41.233 --> 00:13:43.967
It comes up in As I Lay Dying.

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:49.667
So this is the large-scale
housing concentration of the

00:13:49.667 --> 00:13:53.267
mentally retarded in
just one place.

00:13:53.267 --> 00:13:59.533
And as we move on to the early
20th century, we're beginning

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:02.467
to get a new kind of taxonomy.

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.600
Sciences proceed by
way of taxonomy.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:11.500
So we get this 1910 taxonomy
from the American Association

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.900
on Mental Deficiency.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.300
So we're moving closer and
closer to our own time, to

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.200
mental deficiency.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:24.533
So there are three ways to
categorize or classify mental

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:25.900
deficiency.

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.100
The most severe form is the
word "idiot." So actually

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:32.467
Faulkner is taking his word
from that classification.

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:36.633
Idiot is development arrested
at age two.

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:42.333
"Imbecile" for us is just a word
of course, really, that

00:14:42.333 --> 00:14:44.133
we throw at other people.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.133
It actually has a clinical
definition, arrested between

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:49.200
two and seven.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.900
And "moron," again, a word that
we use without thinking

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:55.400
about it, has a clinical
definition, arrested between

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.933
seven and 12.

00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:04.733
So as you can see, by the
early 20th century, the

00:15:04.733 --> 00:15:09.700
scientific thinking about mental
retardation was moving

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.733
more and more towards a
quantitative approach.

00:15:13.733 --> 00:15:19.367
So we see the numbers right
there, ages two to seven, and

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:25.400
then ages seven and 12 to
quantify at what developmental

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.533
stage it was arrested, your
mental capacities were

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:34.767
arrested, and how that would
correlate with various degrees

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.000
of mental retardation.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.200
The person who was instrumental,
who was probably

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.800
the most important figure in
turning a quantitative

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.700
approach into standard practice
was Henry Goddard.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.267
And his quantitative approach
took a number of forms. First

00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:02.467
of all, he was very important as
the director of research at

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.533
the Vineland Training School
for Feeble-Minded Girls and

00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:08.800
Boys, one of the first and one
of the most important for 12

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:12.000
years, 1906 to 1918.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.233
And then, even more important
than that, he was actually a

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:20.633
pioneer in IQ testing, so the
1908 translation of Binet's

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:22.833
intelligence testing.

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:27.500
It was invented by a French
psychologist, Binet, and

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.967
Goddard translated that from
the French and was

00:16:30.967 --> 00:16:34.400
instrumental in getting it
to be widely adopted.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.733
So what we know as IQ tests
really dated from that time,

00:16:38.733 --> 00:16:41.333
once again, completely
quantitative, numerical

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:42.533
measurement.

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:45.567
And then in 1912, he wrote the
book called The Kallikak

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:46.833
Family and Inheritance
of Feeblemindedness.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:54.167
So this is Goddard's
contribution to and widely

00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:58.600
used understanding of
mental retardation.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:04.000
Faulkner can be seen in many
ways as a rejoinder and maybe

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.133
a dissent, a departure from this
quantitative approach.

00:17:09.133 --> 00:17:13.000
His is very much a
non-quantitative approach.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.467
The quantitative approach not
only emphasizes numerical

00:17:16.467 --> 00:17:21.067
measurement but is very much
an objective look at mental

00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:23.667
retardation from the outside.

00:17:23.667 --> 00:17:27.733
It is people who are not
retarded looking at people who

00:17:27.733 --> 00:17:30.500
are retarded and seeing where
they're deficient.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.400
So the deficiency index, the
numerical index, is a

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.367
measurement of how deficient
they are as defined by people

00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:40.567
who are not retarded.

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:44.567
Faulkner's tale told by an idiot
is very much a tale told

00:17:44.567 --> 00:17:47.633
from inside the mind
of an idiot.

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:51.667
It is not told by someone from
the outside looking at Benjy

00:17:51.667 --> 00:17:52.567
from the outside.

00:17:52.567 --> 00:17:57.867
It is told from inside the
consciousness of an idiot with

00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:00.900
the blind self-centeredness
of innocence

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.500
being front and center.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:08.633
That is the defining ground
of Benjy's world.

00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:13.167
So what we get is the very
recognizable modernist

00:18:13.167 --> 00:18:16.100
technique, stream of
consciousness, and in this

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.567
case allowing for extreme
subjectivity.

00:18:18.567 --> 00:18:21.400
So as supposed to the
objectivity of the

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.233
quantitative approach, this
is extreme subjectivity.

00:18:25.233 --> 00:18:29.033
And we see a number of features
associated with this

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:31.133
extreme subjectivity.

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:34.100
One is-- we've seen this before,
refresh your memory

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.067
about this--

00:18:35.067 --> 00:18:38.867
is that the past and the
present are juxtaposed.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:41.967
And we can call it by a
different name, and that is

00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:44.600
nonlinear chronology.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.033
We've also seen the primacy of
smell, and we'll see how that

00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:54.700
really is the basis on which
Faulkner tells the central

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:57.333
story in the Benjy section.

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:58.833
And another interesting
feature is

00:18:58.833 --> 00:18:59.767
the incomplete syntax.

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:01.767
I'll talk about all of this.

00:19:01.767 --> 00:19:04.533
But first, just this
is a passage that

00:19:04.533 --> 00:19:06.067
we looked at before.

00:19:06.067 --> 00:19:08.833
I just want to bring it back.

00:19:08.833 --> 00:19:14.933
This is very early in the Benjy
section, juxtaposing two

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:20.400
moments that might not seem
connected to the rest of us,

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.933
but they are connected
in Benjy's mind.

00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:28.200
"'Did you come to meet Caddy?'
she said, rubbing my hands.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.300
'What is it?

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.933
What are you trying to tell
Caddy?' Caddy smelled like

00:19:32.933 --> 00:19:37.267
trees and like when she
says we were asleep.

00:19:37.267 --> 00:19:39.067
'What are you moaning
about?' Luster said.

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:41.367
'You can watch them again when
we get to the branch.

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:41.933
Here.

00:19:41.933 --> 00:19:43.467
Here's you a jimson weed.'"

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:49.233
So very counter-intuitive
yoking together of two

00:19:49.233 --> 00:19:53.367
experiential moments for Benjy,
yoking together one

00:19:53.367 --> 00:19:56.700
episode having to deal with his
sister, Caddy, the young

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.500
white girl, and the other having
to do with Luster, a

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:01.467
young black servant.

00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.100
So those two are connected.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.700
Benjy makes no racial
distinctions.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:10.333
Very important to register
this fact, no racial

00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:12.000
distinction in Benjy's mind.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.800
That might be one way why an
idiot might not be completely

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.600
deficient in Faulkner's
estimation.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.100
But in any case, he's not making
the usual distinction,

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:29.267
but he is making instead
a connection through

00:20:29.267 --> 00:20:30.633
the sense of smell.

00:20:30.633 --> 00:20:34.667
So Caddy smelt like trees.

00:20:34.667 --> 00:20:37.667
Luster doesn't exactly smell
like trees, but he's coming up

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:41.700
with a good enough substitute,
the jimson weed.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:45.233
So this is Faulkner's
way of substitution.

00:20:45.233 --> 00:20:49.300
The logic of substitution is
also playing out in Faulkner.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.633
And Luster is almost
good enough.

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:54.233
And it's the sense of smell
that connects those two

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:56.533
moments in Benjy's mind.

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:03.233
So here I want to bring up
another psychiatrist,

00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:08.267
psychologist that you would
recognize right away and that

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:12.167
in some sense Faulkner is also
departing from, and this is

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.333
Sigmund Freud.

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:20.200
And in his classic on
Civilization and Its

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:27.867
Discontents, Freud argues that
the development of human

00:21:27.867 --> 00:21:35.467
sexuality makes it less and less
dependent on the sense of

00:21:35.467 --> 00:21:41.533
smell, that the sense of smell
becomes less and less central

00:21:41.533 --> 00:21:45.567
to the demonstration and the

00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:48.233
articulation of human sexuality.

00:21:48.233 --> 00:21:50.700
So this is what Freud says.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:55.600
"The development of human
sexuality seems most likely to

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.333
be connected with the diminution
of the olfactory

00:22:00.333 --> 00:22:05.633
stimuli by means of which the
menstrual process produces an

00:22:05.633 --> 00:22:09.133
effect on the male psyche.

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:16.133
The role was taken over by
visual excitations, which, in

00:22:16.133 --> 00:22:21.767
contrast to the intermittent
olfactory stimuli, were able

00:22:21.767 --> 00:22:23.767
to have a permanent effect."

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:30.200
So we soon recognize the truth
of what Freud is saying, that

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.067
usually we're not attracted
to people because of

00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:33.333
the way they smell.

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:36.367
Usually, the first thing that
gets us is the way they look.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.033
I hope I'm not overly
generalizing, but I think that

00:22:42.033 --> 00:22:46.867
that's probably true of lots
of people is that the first

00:22:46.867 --> 00:22:50.900
factor they register is how that
person looks, not the way

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.533
they smell.

00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:53.200
So Freud is not--

00:22:56.233 --> 00:22:57.467
this is not untrue.

00:22:57.467 --> 00:23:03.433
But the way that he denigrates
the importance of the sense of

00:23:03.433 --> 00:23:08.333
smell is something that one
might take issue with.

00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:15.300
And it turns out that Faulkner
actually is taking issue with

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.100
that denigration of the
sense of smell.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.367
The Sound and the Fury is
obviously about hearing--

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:24.567
that's announced in the
title of the novel--

00:23:24.567 --> 00:23:27.600
but the sense of smell is
actually very important.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:33.167
So what I'd like to do today is
to use the sense of smell

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:36.667
as the index, as the connecting
thread through

00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:41.433
which Faulkner tells
a dramatic story.

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:45.367
And a dramatic story is
obviously Caddy's story told

00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:49.267
through the eyes of her brother,
who loves her, but

00:23:49.267 --> 00:23:52.667
who is completely blind and
completely self-centered in

00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:54.333
his love for Caddy.

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:57.600
So the story goes something
like this.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.133
The innocence, sexual innocence
of Caddy is

00:24:02.133 --> 00:24:04.600
threatened, but it's restored.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.067
It's precariously
restored twice.

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:12.400
And then it is threatened yet
again, and there's no

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.100
restoration this time.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.300
It is lost. It's gone forever.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.833
And that loss does something
to Benjy.

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.367
And we see it in the way that
his syntax becomes incomplete.

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:26.133
And then there's something
else that is

00:24:26.133 --> 00:24:29.333
lost to Benjy as well.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:36.033
But Faulkner, knowing that
innocence has to be sheltered

00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:40.800
through acts of tenderness, is
able through his narrative to

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.900
supply that act of tenderness
that is not coming anymore

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:47.500
from Caddy.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:50.233
So it's a very complicated
story.

00:24:50.233 --> 00:24:52.967
It's actually completely--

00:24:52.967 --> 00:24:56.100
it makes complete sense,
actually, to me.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.667
So in that sense, Faulkner's
telling an extremely coherent

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:04.800
story through complicated,
nonlinear chronology of

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:06.800
Benjy's section.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.133
But it is a story that we have
to reconstruct by following

00:25:13.133 --> 00:25:17.967
one particular phrase that has
to do with the sense of smell.

00:25:17.967 --> 00:25:23.833
So let's go to the first step
of innocence becoming

00:25:23.833 --> 00:25:28.667
dangerously in jeopardy
but being restored

00:25:28.667 --> 00:25:30.267
in the nick of time.

00:25:30.267 --> 00:25:31.867
So--

00:25:31.867 --> 00:25:37.367
"And Caddy put her arms around
me, and her shining veil, and

00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:42.233
I couldn't smell the trees
anymore, and I began to cry.

00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:45.533
'Benjy,' Caddy said. 'Benjy.'
She put her arms around me

00:25:45.533 --> 00:25:47.067
again, and I went away.

00:25:47.067 --> 00:25:48.767
'What is it, Benjy?' she said.

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:51.933
'Is it this hat?' She took
her hat off and came

00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:54.400
again, and I went away.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.867
'Benjy,' she said. 'What
is it, Benjy?

00:25:56.867 --> 00:26:00.567
What has Caddy done?' I went
to the bathroom door.

00:26:00.567 --> 00:26:02.533
I could hear the water.

00:26:02.533 --> 00:26:05.067
I listened to the water.

00:26:05.067 --> 00:26:09.767
I couldn't hear the water, and
Caddy opened the door.

00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:11.433
'Why, Benjy?' she said.

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:13.800
She looked at me, and
I went, and she put

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.133
her arms around me.

00:26:15.133 --> 00:26:18.167
'Did you find Caddy
again?' she said.

00:26:18.167 --> 00:26:22.667
'Did you think Caddy had run
away?' Caddy smelled like

00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:23.767
trees."

00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:28.400
So that is the phrase that is
going to be our guide in the

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:35.200
reconstruction of the drama that
Faulkner is giving us.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.267
And we notice right away that
Caddy is the supplier of

00:26:39.267 --> 00:26:44.033
tenderness for a good part
of Benjy's section.

00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:48.900
Her characteristic gesture is
putting her arms around Benjy.

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.567
And we can think of it both in
terms of the physical act of

00:26:52.567 --> 00:26:57.167
putting her arms around Benjy
but also wrapping her mind

00:26:57.167 --> 00:27:00.533
around Benjy, someone
who's not able to

00:27:00.533 --> 00:27:02.433
tell her what is wrong.

00:27:02.433 --> 00:27:06.200
So Caddy is trying to figure
out what it is that is

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.500
making Benjy cry.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:11.300
And we should remember that all
this time when Benjy is

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.333
crying, it's actually making
this incredible noise.

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:17.000
It's this bellowing that's
just filling up the whole

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.767
house, unbearable.

00:27:18.767 --> 00:27:24.267
So just like the noise in
Hemingway's "Indian Camp,"

00:27:24.267 --> 00:27:27.167
this is unbearable noise
coming from Benjy.

00:27:27.167 --> 00:27:32.633
So just to stop that noise,
Caddy has to figure out what

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:36.233
it is that is upsetting
Benjy to this extent.

00:27:36.233 --> 00:27:38.733
And she tries out a number
of explanations.

00:27:38.733 --> 00:27:41.433
So is it this hat that I'm
wearing that you don't like,

00:27:41.433 --> 00:27:43.267
that's making you so upset?

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:45.633
Wrong answer.

00:27:45.633 --> 00:27:50.333
Caddy figures out the answer,
and it has to do with

00:27:50.333 --> 00:27:54.467
something that requires going to
the bathroom and turning on

00:27:54.467 --> 00:27:55.567
the faucet.

00:27:55.567 --> 00:28:01.100
So this is the only thing that
Benjy is going to tell us is

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.233
that Caddy has figured
out what it is.

00:28:03.233 --> 00:28:04.200
She goes to bathroom.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.867
He hears the water running.

00:28:05.867 --> 00:28:07.300
The water runs for a while.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.167
Can't hear the water anymore.

00:28:09.167 --> 00:28:11.867
Caddy comes out.

00:28:11.867 --> 00:28:13.933
Everything is OK again.

00:28:13.933 --> 00:28:16.867
Caddy puts her arm
around Benjy.

00:28:16.867 --> 00:28:18.700
Caddy smells like trees.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.567
Everything is OK.

00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:22.333
Innocence has been restored.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:27.800
So what is it that was really
upsetting Benjy?

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.733
We find out very soon--
next page, actually.

00:28:30.733 --> 00:28:35.367
Faulkner actually isn't
so impossible to read.

00:28:35.367 --> 00:28:42.133
This is fairly close cluing
in of what exactly was

00:28:42.133 --> 00:28:44.000
upsetting to Benjy.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.633
"'Dilsey,' Caddy said, 'Benjy's
got a present for

00:28:47.633 --> 00:28:53.000
you.' She stooped down and put
the bottle in my hand.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.500
'Hold it up to Dilsey now.'
Caddy held my hand, and Dilsey

00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.767
took the bottle.

00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:02.167
'Well, I declare,'
Dilsey said.

00:29:02.167 --> 00:29:06.467
'If my baby ain't give Dilsey
a bottle of perfume.

00:29:06.467 --> 00:29:10.733
Just look here, Roskus.' Caddy
smelled like trees.

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:14.067
'We don't like perfume
ourselves,' Caddy said.

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:16.000
She smelled like trees."

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
So that is what was upsetting
Benjy is the use of perfume, a

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.167
sign that Caddy is
on her way to

00:29:25.167 --> 00:29:28.800
losing her sexual innocence.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.500
And what is really interesting
is that on this occasion,

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.633
Caddy is able to do exactly
what is needed.

00:29:36.633 --> 00:29:41.633
She gives away the perfume, and
she uses the pronoun "we."

00:29:41.633 --> 00:29:44.000
We don't like perfume anymore.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.200
There's this fusing of herself
and Benjy, even though it

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.600
really is Benjy who objects
to the perfume.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.433
In her act of putting her
arm both physically and

00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:58.067
metaphorically around Benjy,
Caddy uses the more

00:29:58.067 --> 00:30:01.767
encompassing pronoun "we."
That is the syntactic

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:04.500
equivalent to the physical
act of putting

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.300
her arm around Benjy.

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:11.400
So this is one moment when we
can see this clear danger,

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.833
that the danger has
been averted.

00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:15.300
Innocence has been restored.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.933
Let's look at one other moment
when that happens again.

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:27.900
"It was two now, and then
one in the swing.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.500
Caddy came fast, white
in the darkness.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.367
'Benjy,' she said, 'how
did you slip out?

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:39.100
Where's Versh?' She put her arms
around me, and I hushed

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:42.933
and held to her dress and
tried to pull her away.

00:30:42.933 --> 00:30:44.567
Caddy and I ran.

00:30:44.567 --> 00:30:49.400
We ran up the kitchen steps,
onto the porch, and Caddy

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.667
knelt down in the dark
and held me.

00:30:52.667 --> 00:30:57.300
I could hear her and feel her
chest. 'I won't,' she said.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.833
'I won't anymore, ever.

00:30:58.833 --> 00:30:59.733
Benjy.

00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:03.767
Benjy.' Then she was crying, and
I cried, and we held each

00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:06.333
other. 'Hush,' she
said. 'Hush.

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:11.300
I won't anymore.' So I hushed,
and Caddy got up.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.133
And we went into the kitchen and
turned the light on, and

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:19.533
Caddy took the kitchen soap and
washed her mouth at the

00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:21.000
sink, hard.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.367
Caddy smelled like trees."

00:31:23.367 --> 00:31:27.700
Once again, that very
reliable thread that

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.200
Faulkner is giving us.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:33.500
So we've just looked at one
kind of arithmetic in the

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:39.433
earlier use of the pronoun "we."
Caddy and Benjy being

00:31:39.433 --> 00:31:44.333
two different people but being
turned into a single unit by

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:48.733
that first-person plural, "we."
The two of them had

00:31:48.733 --> 00:31:51.233
become one in that
earlier moment.

00:31:51.233 --> 00:31:55.533
Here, it's the repetition of
that kind of logic, except

00:31:55.533 --> 00:32:00.333
that it is not Benji who's
being fused with Caddy.

00:32:00.333 --> 00:32:06.800
"It was two now, and then one
in the swing." Caddy and her

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:10.833
beau in the swing, the two
of them becoming one.

00:32:10.833 --> 00:32:16.733
And it is that sight that is
unbearable to Benjy, so that's

00:32:16.733 --> 00:32:19.033
why he's crying.

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:21.133
And Caddy this time doesn't
have to guess.

00:32:21.133 --> 00:32:23.900
She knows exactly what
it is that is

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.833
upsetting Benjy so much.

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:31.533
So once again, she tries her
best to make things OK for

00:32:31.533 --> 00:32:32.467
Benjy again.

00:32:32.467 --> 00:32:36.500
She puts her arm around Benjy.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.300
And then she does what is
needed one more time.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:45.667
And it is within her capacity
to do what is needed.

00:32:45.667 --> 00:32:48.533
So she goes to the kitchen--

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:52.133
it's not the bathroom, but it's
really the equivalent,

00:32:52.133 --> 00:32:54.633
functional equivalent,
of the bathroom--

00:32:54.633 --> 00:32:59.933
turns the light on, turns on the
faucet one more time, the

00:32:59.933 --> 00:33:02.767
necessary ingredient-- all
those other necessary

00:33:02.767 --> 00:33:06.533
ingredients to the restoration
of innocence--

00:33:06.533 --> 00:33:10.933
faucet, soap, and water--
washing out her mouth so that

00:33:10.933 --> 00:33:13.433
she once again smells
like trees.

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:20.033
So we can see that Caddy is
doing everything that Benjy is

00:33:20.033 --> 00:33:24.100
demanding from her, but I think
that we can also see how

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:26.700
unreasonable Benjy is.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:32.933
So let's not romanticize Benjy
and just call him innocent.

00:33:32.933 --> 00:33:36.633
He is innocent, but this is an
innocence that is not only

00:33:36.633 --> 00:33:39.733
blind to the needs of Caddy--

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:42.233
she is going to become
a woman.

00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:45.933
She's not going to be able to
wash herself clean every time

00:33:45.933 --> 00:33:48.133
with soap and water.

00:33:48.133 --> 00:33:52.567
And Benjy simply has no
recognition of Caddy as a

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:57.733
separate person who has her
own developmental path.

00:33:57.733 --> 00:34:01.033
She's going to turn from a
young girl to a woman.

00:34:01.033 --> 00:34:04.233
That's her developmental path.

00:34:04.233 --> 00:34:07.933
And because Benjy is arrested
at age two, he wants

00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:08.800
everybody--

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.033
or whatever, age two
or age four--

00:34:12.033 --> 00:34:15.900
because he's arrested at such
an early age, he wants

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.667
everybody to be developmentally
arrested at

00:34:19.667 --> 00:34:22.867
that age as well, with that
degree of innocence.

00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:26.933
And that, Caddy is not able
to to do for him.

00:34:26.933 --> 00:34:37.833
So it is a very impossible, very
self-centered demand that

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:43.133
Benjy is imposing on Caddy, and
in that sense, sowing the

00:34:43.133 --> 00:34:45.533
seed of his own destruction.

00:34:45.533 --> 00:34:52.333
It is a demand that Caddy can
never meet in the long run.

00:34:52.333 --> 00:34:55.833
It's almost like the impossible
demand that Gatsby

00:34:55.833 --> 00:34:57.633
is putting on Daisy.

00:34:57.633 --> 00:35:01.500
We're beginning to see actually
a pattern of people

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.467
who love intensely, but in the
very intensity of the love,

00:35:06.467 --> 00:35:10.733
putting an impossible demand
on the loved object.

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:16.133
Just no human being is capable
of meeting that demand.

00:35:16.133 --> 00:35:24.967
So not surprisingly, we see this
time Caddy failing Benjy.

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:28.567
And see what's in this
passage and what

00:35:28.567 --> 00:35:30.733
is not in this passage.

00:35:30.733 --> 00:35:32.767
"We were in the hall.

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:35.333
Caddy was still looking at me.

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:37.667
Her hand was against
her mouth.

00:35:37.667 --> 00:35:40.800
She stopped again, against
the wall, looking

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.000
at me, and I cried.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.067
And she went on, and
I came on, crying.

00:35:46.067 --> 00:35:49.800
And she shrank against the
wall, looking at me.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.767
She opened the door
to her room, but I

00:35:51.767 --> 00:35:53.033
pulled at her dress.

00:35:53.033 --> 00:35:56.233
And we went to the bathroom,
and she stood against the

00:35:56.233 --> 00:35:58.567
door, looking at me.

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:04.367
Then she put her arm across her
face, and I pushed at her,

00:36:04.367 --> 00:36:06.267
crying."

00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:11.833
So the characteristic gesture
coming from Caddy putting her

00:36:11.833 --> 00:36:17.333
arms around Benjy, that is
not here in this passage.

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:21.533
And instead, she's putting her
arm across her own face.

00:36:21.533 --> 00:36:24.100
And she's doing this because
Benjy is trying to get her to

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:31.067
go to the bathroom to achieve
that previously tried solution

00:36:31.067 --> 00:36:32.933
that worked before.

00:36:32.933 --> 00:36:35.967
Benjy thought it would
work one more time.

00:36:35.967 --> 00:36:40.667
This time, that solution
isn't going to work.

00:36:40.667 --> 00:36:45.800
So we see it in the
nonappearance of that gesture

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.900
coming from Caddy's
arms around Benjy.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.533
She's not able to do that.

00:36:50.533 --> 00:36:53.500
And we also see the
nonappearance of that phrase,

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.633
"Caddy smelled like trees." She
doesn't smell like trees

00:36:56.633 --> 00:37:00.533
anymore, and she never will
smell like trees again.

00:37:00.533 --> 00:37:06.633
So this is Faulkner's way of
telling the story of lost

00:37:06.633 --> 00:37:10.533
sexual innocence completely
through the sense of smell and

00:37:10.533 --> 00:37:16.033
through this very indirect way
of channeling it through the

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:20.300
mind of someone who's mentally
retarded, who can't name their

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:25.133
condition, can't really name
that loss, but who registers

00:37:25.133 --> 00:37:28.367
that loss as a sensory loss.

00:37:28.367 --> 00:37:35.100
So he's not able to reason, but
his senses tell him what

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:36.133
actually has happened.

00:37:36.133 --> 00:37:39.433
So this is one way in which
Benjy actually both

00:37:39.433 --> 00:37:41.967
knows and not knows.

00:37:41.967 --> 00:37:44.700
He knows really in the sense
that his reaction says that he

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.200
knows, but he doesn't know in
the sense that he can't give

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.233
the reason, can't name
the condition.

00:37:51.233 --> 00:37:58.100
So let's look at the
consequences of that loss on

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.900
Caddy's part.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:05.133
What happens to Benjy when he
loses Caddy in this way?

00:38:05.133 --> 00:38:09.333
And the way Faulkner is telling
that story is by this

00:38:09.333 --> 00:38:14.433
technique of Benjy not finishing
his sentences.

00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:19.167
So let's look at this incomplete
syntax all the way

00:38:19.167 --> 00:38:22.633
through the Benjy section,
but especially

00:38:22.633 --> 00:38:25.600
striking in this moment.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.700
"They came on.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.933
I opened the gate,
and they stopped.

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:30.867
turning.

00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:36.367
I was trying to say, and I
caught her, trying to say.

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:41.033
And she screamed, and I was
trying to say and trying.

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.333
And the bright shapes
began to stop.

00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:45.567
And I tried to get up.

00:38:45.567 --> 00:38:49.333
I tried to get it off of my
face, but the bright shapes

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:50.900
were going again.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:54.700
They were going up the hill to
where it fell away, and I

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.200
tried to cry.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.400
But when I breathed in,
I couldn't breathe

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.167
out again to cry.

00:39:00.167 --> 00:39:03.233
And I tried to keep from falling
off the hill, and I

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:08.100
fell off the hill into the
bright, whirling shapes."

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:11.867
So it's told as a jumble
of sensations.

00:39:11.867 --> 00:39:15.600
This is the only way Benjy can
tell the story, but we can

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.133
know roughly what is going on.

00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.433
We need more to know that
someone had left a gate open.

00:39:24.433 --> 00:39:29.767
So some schoolgirls were going
by, and Benjy had lost Caddy

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:30.900
at this point.

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.000
He sees the schoolgirls.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.800
He's always looking for
substitutes for Caddy, so he

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.200
grabs one of those
schoolgirls.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:43.033
"I caught her, trying to say."
And we can almost see that

00:39:43.033 --> 00:39:45.867
this is the consequence of what
happens to Benjy when

00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:49.300
there's not Caddy there
to complete his

00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:51.600
sentences for him.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.167
Caddy putting her arm around
Benjy is her way of finishing

00:39:56.167 --> 00:39:59.733
his sentences, saying what he
cannot say for himself.

00:39:59.733 --> 00:40:02.933
She's not there to
do that for him.

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:08.600
So Benjy's sentences are left
hanging incomplete, always

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.667
"trying to say," without the
predicate, without an object,

00:40:13.667 --> 00:40:17.600
without just this grammatical
complement to

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:20.100
finishing that sentence.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:26.500
And that's just how things are
going to be for him forever,

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:31.733
trying to say something, trying
to express himself to

00:40:31.733 --> 00:40:34.200
the world without the resources
of language and

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:36.200
without the manual capacity
to do so.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:39.967
So we also know what happens
when that really--

00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:42.733
this is the moment where
Faulkner is actually

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:44.700
registering mental deficiency.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.467
Something is lacking, something
is missing from

00:40:47.467 --> 00:40:49.267
Benjy's world.

00:40:49.267 --> 00:40:52.800
And something is happening
to Benjy as well.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.067
It looks like something is
being put on his face, he

00:40:56.067 --> 00:41:00.700
can't breathe, that he is
fighting it, but this thing is

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.600
happening to him.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:06.767
So what is it that's happening
to Benjy at this moment?

00:41:06.767 --> 00:41:10.500
We see the physical
manifestation of what's

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:13.000
happening to him just
a little later.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:22.167
"I got undressed, and I looked
at myself, and I began to cry.

00:41:22.167 --> 00:41:26.567
'Hush,' Luster said.

00:41:26.567 --> 00:41:30.600
'Looking for them ain't
going to do no good.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:33.433
They're gone.'"

00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:37.100
So that is what happens
to Benjy.

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.767
I think that we know what
happens, that people who are

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.767
mentally retarded,
who are a threat

00:41:46.767 --> 00:41:48.533
to others, get castrated.

00:41:48.533 --> 00:41:51.067
This still happens.

00:41:51.067 --> 00:42:00.700
So it is a very graphic
rendition of the loss that

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:04.433
comes to Benjy when
he loses Caddy.

00:42:04.433 --> 00:42:09.800
But I would say, even though
it's a horrible fate, and

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.967
Benjy can't really bear to look
at himself-- so he really

00:42:12.967 --> 00:42:16.367
has that degree of
self-consciousness--

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:21.000
but I have to say that it
actually shows some degree of

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.300
narrative tenderness on
the part of Faulkner.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.100
And I really want to emphasize
this, because thematically,

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.000
the tenderness is not going
to come from Caddy.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.400
She's lost that ability.

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:37.900
So something else has to supply
that tenderness that

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.733
will shield and shelter Benjy.

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:43.233
And Faulkner is the one
who's doing this.

00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:46.733
So on the one hand, it is
terrible that there should be

00:42:46.733 --> 00:42:52.567
that loss coming to Benjy, but
at the same time, that loss

00:42:52.567 --> 00:42:57.767
once again establishes a bond
between Benjy and Caddy.

00:42:57.767 --> 00:43:01.333
They do have something in
common, even though Caddy

00:43:01.333 --> 00:43:04.333
doesn't know it, and Benjy is
the last person to be able to

00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:06.467
say it, to name that
condition.

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:07.967
Nonetheless, there is a bond.

00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:13.300
It's almost as if Caddy has
suffered this terrible thing

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.600
that she's devastated by.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:22.633
But this is a point in time
where to have that loss is a

00:43:22.633 --> 00:43:30.167
incredible statement on Caddy,
when something ruins her life,

00:43:30.167 --> 00:43:35.300
and Benjy's life is also ruined,
devastated, in a

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:37.133
parallel fashion.

00:43:37.133 --> 00:43:39.033
So the two of them actually
do have--

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:41.533
I wouldn't push this point
so far, it's really not a

00:43:41.533 --> 00:43:44.533
consolation to anyone to have
that particular thing in

00:43:44.533 --> 00:43:50.767
common -- but this is the
symmetry that Faulkner is

00:43:50.767 --> 00:43:54.500
creating for Benjy and Caddy.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.867
We'll look at one
other moment--

00:43:57.867 --> 00:44:02.967
and this is the very end
of the Benjy section--

00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:11.533
in which we see maybe a more
compelling, more persuasive

00:44:11.533 --> 00:44:20.033
way in which a shelter could be
devised for Benjy without

00:44:20.033 --> 00:44:21.800
Caddy being physically there.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.500
So this is the very end
of the Benjy section.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.500
And I'm telling you what I want
to say, but obviously

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:32.833
we're back to the
experimentation

00:44:32.833 --> 00:44:34.933
on the part of Faulkner.

00:44:34.933 --> 00:44:36.800
But let's just look at his.

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:41.133
"Father went to the door
and looked at us again.

00:44:41.133 --> 00:44:45.600
Then the dark came back, and
he stood black in the door,

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.200
and then the door turned
black again.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:52.833
Caddy held me, and I could hear
us all in the darkness,

00:44:52.833 --> 00:44:56.167
and something I could smell.

00:44:56.167 --> 00:44:57.633
And then I could see
the windows, where

00:44:57.633 --> 00:44:59.567
the trees were buzzing.

00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:03.867
Then the dark began to go in
smooth, bright shapes, like it

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:10.100
always does, even when Caddy
says that I have been asleep."

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.767
This is coming at the very end
of Benjy's section, when he's

00:45:13.767 --> 00:45:17.900
33 and he's back again to
being the young boy.

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:24.100
So finally it is revealed
to us what the nonlinear

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:26.900
chronology is doing for Benjy.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:30.600
Being 33 is no place
for Benjy to be.

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.867
It's a terrible place.

00:45:32.867 --> 00:45:35.467
No one wants in his
condition--

00:45:35.467 --> 00:45:39.167
of course, the age when Christ
was crucified, obviously, that

00:45:39.167 --> 00:45:40.833
is the reference.

00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:45.967
So Benjy is going to be
crucified at age 33.

00:45:45.967 --> 00:45:53.300
And Faulkner wants that
crucification to happen and to

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:54.700
be registered.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.533
But he doesn't want
that to be the

00:45:57.533 --> 00:46:01.600
experiential ending for Benjy.

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:05.833
So because he's telling the
story in a nonlinear fashion,

00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:10.733
he can choose to end the story
at a much earlier point.

00:46:10.733 --> 00:46:14.000
And he can do that because past
and present are always

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.600
juxtaposed in Benjy's mind
anyways, and he can't tell the

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.900
difference between
past and present.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.300
So at the very end of Benjy's
section, he actually goes

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:26.600
back-- there's a bit of time
travel for Benjy-- he gets to

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.833
go back to a very satisfying
moment in time.

00:46:29.833 --> 00:46:33.933
And let's look at how this
moment reconstitutes all those

00:46:33.933 --> 00:46:36.867
things that are dear to Benjy.

00:46:36.867 --> 00:46:38.267
The dark comes back.

00:46:38.267 --> 00:46:39.300
The trees are buzzing.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:45.567
So there's this sight and sound
fuse that really is the

00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:50.300
defining feature of Benjy's
world, and of no explanation

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:55.867
at all, but very reassuring
visual images, the father

00:46:55.867 --> 00:46:58.567
still alive, black in the
door, and then the door

00:46:58.567 --> 00:46:59.400
turning black.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.500
And that's how Benjy wants it
to be, wants to be asleep,

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:05.967
wants to be in bed with
Caddy holding him.

00:47:05.967 --> 00:47:11.400
And he could smell something.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.900
What is really interesting is
that there's almost no need to

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:19.600
mention that Caddy smells
like trees.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.200
And that actually is
the best condition.

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.267
Even that phrase "Caddy smelled
like trees" already

00:47:27.267 --> 00:47:31.900
suggests that she's in danger
of not smelling like trees.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:35.667
Benjy needs to mention that
Caddy smelled like trees when

00:47:35.667 --> 00:47:38.533
she stopped smelling like
trees for a moment.

00:47:38.533 --> 00:47:42.300
And so even the appearance of
that phrase signals that

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:44.067
there's already a
danger present.

00:47:44.067 --> 00:47:47.033
And maybe it's been averted, but
the danger has been there.

00:47:47.033 --> 00:47:49.667
Not being able to name that--
and she actually also smells

00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:52.567
of mud at that point,
her muddy drawers.

00:47:52.567 --> 00:47:54.433
She was completely muddy
from fighting in

00:47:54.433 --> 00:47:56.633
the water with Quentin.

00:47:56.633 --> 00:48:00.767
So he smells trees, he smells
mud, the smell of an innocent

00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:01.400
young girl.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:07.400
And that is the smell that Benjy
wants to die smelling.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.800
So he gets to smell that.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.400
But what is also interesting
is that there's a backward

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:16.867
reference to the previous
traumatic moment, the smooth

00:48:16.867 --> 00:48:17.233
bright shapes.

00:48:17.233 --> 00:48:23.600
If we just go back to that
horrible, traumatic moment,

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:30.733
those are the bright, whirling
shapes that were forced upon

00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:34.333
Benjy at this moment when he's
completely helpless, when he's

00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:38.933
pinned down when Caddy is
nowhere to be seen.

00:48:38.933 --> 00:48:44.067
Those bright, whirling shapes
at this supremely traumatic

00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:50.733
moment, those have been
reconstituted as comforting

00:48:50.733 --> 00:48:56.767
shapes that he just doesn't know
why they're there, but

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:57.867
he's falling asleep.

00:48:57.867 --> 00:49:00.133
And Caddy is telling him that
he's falling asleep.

00:49:00.133 --> 00:49:03.900
He doesn't even have the word
to talk about, describe the

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:07.100
condition of being asleep,
but it's OK.

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.733
This is really one moment when
not having language is

00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:12.633
completely OK.

00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:17.400
And Faulkner has managed to
bring Benjy back to the point

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:21.533
where life actually is
bearable and in fact

00:49:21.533 --> 00:49:23.967
satisfying.

00:49:23.967 --> 00:49:25.633
Faulkner can't really
do more than that.

00:49:25.633 --> 00:49:29.033
He can't really bring
true happiness,

00:49:29.033 --> 00:49:31.400
actual objective happiness.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:35.800
He can't bring objective
happiness to Benjy at 33.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:39.800
The only way he can bring is
subjective satisfaction to

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:45.933
Benjy at the age 33, acting as
if he were much younger and

00:49:45.933 --> 00:49:47.600
still having Caddy there.

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.367
So the narrative experimentation
is really

00:49:52.367 --> 00:49:56.833
completely thematically
consequential as well.

00:49:56.833 --> 00:50:00.200
And that really is the story
that Faulkner's telling.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.833
So we'll move on next
time to Quentin's

00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:05.100
section, section two.

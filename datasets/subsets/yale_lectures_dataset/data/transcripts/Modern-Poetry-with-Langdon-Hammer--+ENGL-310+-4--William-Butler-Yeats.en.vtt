00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.418
Professor Langdon
Hammer: For Wednesday--This

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:22.950
is my--our first Yeats lecture.
 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.500
We're going to have three of
them.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:34.460
For the next class I'd like you
to, well, I'd like you to do a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.310
few things.
I know that your teaching

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.580
fellows will have handed out a
meter exercise for you.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.360
I'd like you to work on
something else.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.365
You don't have to do this for
Wednesday but let's say for next

00:00:52.365 --> 00:00:56.140
Monday, and that is:
I'd like you to memorize a

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.079
short poem by Yeats or by Frost,
either one.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.978
And this poem could be the
basis of a first paper,

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:07.627
a topic for one.
It doesn't have to be but it

00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:11.472
might be.
And on Wednesday I'll also hand

00:01:11.472 --> 00:01:14.819
out a topic for paper number
one.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:21.934
In class I'll talk about
"Easter 1916," "The Magi," "The

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:26.849
Second Coming," "Leda and the
Swan,"

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.708
and I'd like you to pay special
attention to these special

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:34.010
Yeatsian words:
"tumult,"

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.470
"turbulence," "bestial."
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.545
Think about also that phrase
"terrible beauty" in "Easter

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.681
1916."
And finally,

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:52.090
in your RIS packet you'll see a
timeline that charts significant

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.794
dates in modern poetry that
tells you something about when

00:01:58.794 --> 00:02:04.909
the different poets we're
reading were working,

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.979
and helps you perhaps keep
track of them;

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.807
because confusingly,
although the course has a kind

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:17.171
of rough chronological order,
we do move back and forth in

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:19.313
time.
And in fact today,

00:02:19.313 --> 00:02:23.674
right now, we're going to move
back the furthest we go,

00:02:23.674 --> 00:02:28.681
all the way into the nineteenth
century to talk about the early

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.137
Yeats.
Yeats's career is maybe the

00:02:32.137 --> 00:02:35.370
most famous one in modern
poetry;

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.861
that is, a career that has been
seen as a kind of representative

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:45.880
story about modern poetry as a
whole.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.310
What's that story?
 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.778
Well, Yeats begins as a
Romantic visionary and a late

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:59.924
nineteenth-century aesthete,
and under the pressure of

00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:05.332
political and social crisis he
breaks with the artificial

00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:10.644
rhetoric of his early poems and
becomes a kind of heroic

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:15.450
realist.
Now, there's something to this

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.841
story but it is also a kind of
cliché, and I'll try to

00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:25.838
introduce,
I think, a more true and also

00:03:25.838 --> 00:03:29.569
more interesting way of
understanding Yeats's

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.350
development today,
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.660
 
 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.330
starting with this picture.
 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.900
This is an unlikely picture.
 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.827
The face there,
if you have seen him before,

00:03:45.827 --> 00:03:48.750
you will recognize as Yeats's.
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.030
This is Yeats as King Goll.
 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.247
This is Yeats in costume,
costumed as a figure from Irish

00:03:59.247 --> 00:04:03.577
myth, as an ancient bard,
mad King Goll,

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:09.240
which is the furthest thing
from a modern poet.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.174
It's a late Victorian image of
an archaic singer rendered in

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:16.375
the melodramatic manner of
Pre-Raphaelite art and

00:04:16.375 --> 00:04:20.509
thoroughly removed from the
aesthetic values of modernism,

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.528
such as naturalism,
formal clarity,

00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:26.370
emotional restraint and so on.
 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.170
It's an image that was created
by Yeats's father,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.670
the painter John Yeats.
 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.062
You could also say that it was
created by the late

00:04:37.062 --> 00:04:40.246
nineteenth-century culture that
Yeats's father,

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:43.569
John, represented and
introduced to his son.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:48.425
It's an image of Yeats that
modern poetry eventually forgot,

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:52.787
Yeats as an un-modern,
nineteenth-century poet hamming

00:04:52.787 --> 00:04:55.358
it up.
But this poet is,

00:04:55.358 --> 00:05:00.399
in fact, important to the one
that Yeats became.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:05.509
In a way, Yeats is always in
costume.

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:11.258
His poetic identity is forged
through identification with the

00:05:11.258 --> 00:05:17.014
heroic characters of his poems,
characters who are sometimes

00:05:17.014 --> 00:05:20.906
surrogates for the poet,
such as King Goll,

00:05:20.906 --> 00:05:26.374
the warrior Cuchulain or the
mysterious Michael Robartes –

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:29.339
all characters you'll meet.
 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:33.709
Or who are sometimes simply
versions of the poet himself;

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:39.314
that is, the poet rendering
himself for us in stylized

00:05:39.314 --> 00:05:42.684
roles;
that is, Yeats the public man,

00:05:42.684 --> 00:05:46.050
Yeats the lover,
Yeats the mad old man.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.232
Yeats is always creating
himself in his poems and

00:05:50.232 --> 00:05:54.589
creating himself as a kind of
version of a type.

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:00.252
And he does the same thing,
in fact, to those around him,

00:06:00.252 --> 00:06:03.898
famously to his lover,
Maude Gonne,

00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:09.686
who becomes Helen of Troy in
"No Second Troy" and in other

00:06:09.686 --> 00:06:12.820
poems.
The martyrs in the Easter

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.995
Rebellion of 1916 become ancient
Irish warriors,

00:06:16.995 --> 00:06:20.459
and we'll talk about that next
time.

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:25.698
There are many other instances
of this myth-making imagination

00:06:25.698 --> 00:06:28.790
that Yeats is always working
with.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:33.968
Yeats takes on self-consciously
staged identities,

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:38.830
requiring costumes,
and he sees other people in

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.269
similarly theatrical and mythic
terms.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.554
His poetry is,
in fact, deeply

00:06:45.554 --> 00:06:49.335
autobiographical,
but it doesn't necessarily help

00:06:49.335 --> 00:06:54.219
to know that because his life is
not a reliable key for reading

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.922
the poems,
exactly because he treated his

00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:05.005
life as art, raising the
particulars of his experience

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:11.667
into general symbols,
working the narrative of his

00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:16.576
life into myth.
This is a way of conceiving his

00:07:16.576 --> 00:07:20.547
activity as a poet but it's
also, as we'll see,

00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:24.518
a way of conceiving,
in fact, culture and human

00:07:24.518 --> 00:07:26.589
history in general.
 

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:31.069
In Yeats, people are always
particulars who are fitted to

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:35.709
types, which are new versions of
old identities that travel

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:39.058
across time.
In a certain sense,

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:43.739
Yeats, I think,
really felt that he was King

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:46.744
Goll.
Now, the story of King Goll is

00:07:46.744 --> 00:07:48.835
interesting.
It's a longish poem,

00:07:48.835 --> 00:07:51.807
not in your anthology,
but you can find it in The

00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:55.612
Complete Yeats,
and I've given you on this

00:07:55.612 --> 00:07:59.686
handout page just a couple
stanzas from it,

00:07:59.686 --> 00:08:02.500
so you have a sense of it.
 

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.510
King Goll is a mythical Irish
ruler who goes mad in the heat

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.217
of battle.
He becomes distracted by an

00:08:11.217 --> 00:08:17.287
inward fire that draws him into
the woods where he wanders and

00:08:17.287 --> 00:08:20.970
sings, full of unfulfilled
desire.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:27.427
Finally, he destroys his harp,
in the scene represented by

00:08:27.427 --> 00:08:30.600
Yeats's father's portrait.
 

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:35.718
This story is a certain version
of Yeats's own early ambition to

00:08:35.718 --> 00:08:40.511
become a particular kind of
figure--not an Irish king but an

00:08:40.511 --> 00:08:44.333
Irish poet,
which would mean consolidating

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:49.368
in himself a sense of national
identity and explaining that

00:08:49.368 --> 00:08:51.613
identity,
representing it,

00:08:51.613 --> 00:08:56.501
embodying it in all senses;
representing and embodying

00:08:56.501 --> 00:09:02.491
Irishness, for an English
speaking readership in Ireland,

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:06.450
but also in England and
elsewhere.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.409
The nationality of that
identity is important;

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:13.909
that is, Yeats's Irishness,
and so is Yeats's audience.

00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:19.916
His ambition is to become the
first major Irish poet writing

00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:22.233
in English.
Significantly,

00:09:22.233 --> 00:09:26.560
this picture of Yeats as King
Goll was used as an illustration

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.320
for his first appearance in an
English periodical,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.879
a magazine of art and ideas
called The Leisure Hour.

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:42.241
Yeats bridges Irish and English
cultures, and he is importantly

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:49.009
Protestant with social and
family ties to English life.

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:53.240
The ambition that I'm
describing is a public and

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.495
political one.
But paradoxically,

00:09:56.495 --> 00:10:02.545
perhaps, for the young Yeats
this ambition drew him away from

00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:08.596
the social and political world
into the charmed landscapes of

00:10:08.596 --> 00:10:13.024
Irish myth,
maybe in the same way as King

00:10:13.024 --> 00:10:17.780
Goll is drawn away from,
lured away from battle,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.330
to wander in the Irish wood.
 

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:27.229
All of Yeats's early poetry
takes place in a symbolic,

00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:31.291
mythic domain.
King Goll's madness and the

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:36.362
destruction of his instruments
are perhaps warnings about the

00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:41.940
dangers of a poetry that would
be confined to a symbolic world,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.980
as if to fully enter it,
to fully enter a mythical

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:50.929
world, to write a kind of pure
poetry that was archaic in its

00:10:50.929 --> 00:10:55.299
aims and its sources – this
would be to go mad,

00:10:55.299 --> 00:11:00.277
to give sway to dangerously
inward passions that can't be

00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:04.009
satisfied, to be cut off from
the world.

00:11:04.009 --> 00:11:08.676
Being cut off from the world in
some kind of higher or separate

00:11:08.676 --> 00:11:14.057
reality is a lure and threat,
opened up for Yeats by the

00:11:14.057 --> 00:11:20.854
particular ambition that he had
to write a mythic poetry on

00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:25.444
Irish themes.
Now, something else is worth

00:11:25.444 --> 00:11:31.261
highlighting about King Goll as
a way to understand who Yeats

00:11:31.261 --> 00:11:34.779
was.
King Goll is a singer.

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:39.916
Identifying with him,
Yeats identifies poetry with

00:11:39.916 --> 00:11:42.073
song;
in particular,

00:11:42.073 --> 00:11:47.261
with songs of passion in
which--songs in which sound

00:11:47.261 --> 00:11:51.330
takes over, is ravishing,
enchanting.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:58.110
Yeats's early poetry has those
aspects of song as its aim.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:04.427
They suggest verbal and oral
equivalents for the poetry's

00:12:04.427 --> 00:12:08.149
cognitive concern with symbols.
 

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:12.291
That is, in sound,
just as in theme,

00:12:12.291 --> 00:12:18.563
Yeats's poetry is idealized,
purified, sensually rich,

00:12:18.563 --> 00:12:21.640
and yet also abstract.
 

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.849
Contrast Frost.
Yeats's poetry dominated the

00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:31.279
poetry world in which Frost
began writing and publishing.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:36.728
Yeats publishes "King Goll" in
The Leisure Hour,

00:12:36.728 --> 00:12:42.782
and Frost mocks the ideal of
poetry as the "dream of the gift

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:47.681
of idle hours";
he mocks the idea of poetry as

00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:53.843
"easy gold at the hand of fay or
elf" in "Mowing" –characters

00:12:53.843 --> 00:12:57.620
that come right out of early
Yeats.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.192
Frost's realism,
his roughness,

00:13:00.192 --> 00:13:04.650
which is part of his
sensibility – it's part of the

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:11.221
sound of his poetry – well,
it contrasts quite directly

00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:19.675
with the smoothness sought by
Yeats and the kind of simulation

00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:24.789
of ease.
You could go to Yeats's poem

00:13:24.789 --> 00:13:32.226
"Adam's Curse" to see the poet
talking about this aesthetic

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:36.744
ideal.
Yeats there in "Adam's Curse,"

00:13:36.744 --> 00:13:43.024
which is in your anthology,
calls specifically for a kind

00:13:43.024 --> 00:13:49.408
of simulation of ease in poetry,
which is a traditionally

00:13:49.408 --> 00:13:54.427
aristocratic ideal,
one which hides one's labor in

00:13:54.427 --> 00:13:59.139
order to make accomplishments
seem natural.

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:03.351
Yeats, in "Adam's Curse,"
regrets that the beautiful is

00:14:03.351 --> 00:14:08.419
something to be labored for and
he wants to conceal that labor.

00:14:08.419 --> 00:14:12.960
The contrast with Frost is
powerful.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:18.077
Yeats once said that he wanted
the natural words in the natural

00:14:18.077 --> 00:14:22.699
order, but he had a very highly
cultured sense of what is

00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:26.576
natural,
and his poetry is full of

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:31.528
verbal archaism.
It's characterized by a kind of

00:14:31.528 --> 00:14:33.649
high, formal bearing.
 

00:14:33.649 --> 00:14:38.686
It has a careful decorum,
a kind of high sheen,

00:14:38.686 --> 00:14:42.080
especially this early poetry.
 

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:49.157
Metrically, Yeats's attitudes
result in a kind of superb

00:14:49.157 --> 00:14:53.379
regularity.
In the early Yeats you find

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:58.194
smooth, unbroken lines,
a diction that's elegant and

00:14:58.194 --> 00:15:02.348
seemingly easy,
without ever deigning to seem

00:15:02.348 --> 00:15:04.519
merely colloquial.
 

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:10.430
The sound of Yeats was,
and was meant to be,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.698
seductive.
The poems are,

00:15:13.698 --> 00:15:20.173
in fact, very often about kinds
of seduction – a child,

00:15:20.173 --> 00:15:23.779
a king,
the poet, these figures are

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:28.769
drawn away from society or from
family towards secret,

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:33.373
sacred places,
magical places of love that are

00:15:33.373 --> 00:15:39.819
frequently imaged in these poems
as an island or the center of a

00:15:39.819 --> 00:15:42.946
wood;
in short, places of privacy

00:15:42.946 --> 00:15:47.687
that shut the world out and that
stand for Yeats's ideal of

00:15:47.687 --> 00:15:51.657
poetic autonomy,
his desire to create and

00:15:51.657 --> 00:15:56.190
inhabit self-sufficient,
imaginative worlds.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.029
"The Lake Isle of Innisfree,"
"Who Goes with Fergus?"

00:16:01.029 --> 00:16:06.810
"The Hosting of the Sidhe":
these are all poems from your

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:12.384
anthology that exemplify this
idea, and there are many,

00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:16.331
many more.
These poems come from a phase

00:16:16.331 --> 00:16:20.213
in Yeats's career,
the climax of which is this

00:16:20.213 --> 00:16:25.303
book published in 1899 that I
showed you the cover of in the

00:16:25.303 --> 00:16:29.038
first class,
The Wind Among the

00:16:29.038 --> 00:16:34.440
Reeds, with its gorgeous
Celtic aestheticism.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:38.542
Here's the title page,
reminding us,

00:16:38.542 --> 00:16:45.224
again, that this gorgeous
Celtic aestheticism is published

00:16:45.224 --> 00:16:52.340
and put up for sale in London,
which is important again.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:58.357
And here's the table of
contents, which you can't read,

00:16:58.357 --> 00:17:00.919
that has on it,
well,

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:05.135
the first poem,
"The Hosting of the Sidhe,"

00:17:05.135 --> 00:17:08.849
"The Song of the Wandering
Aengus,"

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:13.759
and other famous poems from
Yeats's early career.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:17.578
I'd like to look with you at
"The Song of the Wandering

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:21.609
Aengus" as a kind of model of
the kind of poem I'm talking

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:23.660
about and its aesthetics.
 

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.940
It's on page 98.
 

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:31.670
 
 

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:38.750
Yeats says:
I went out to the hazel

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:44.519
wood [Yeats says--that is to
say, Aengus says;

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:49.430
it's a dramatic monologue for
Aengus],

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:58.380
Because a fire was in my head,
And cut and peeled a hazel wand,

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:02.470
And hooked a berry to a thread
[If you're having problems

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.802
identifying
iambic pentameter this

00:18:04.802 --> 00:18:07.253
should--well,
it's not quite pentameter,

00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:14.098
but if you
want to get an iambic rhythm in

00:18:14.098 --> 00:18:21.007
your head, this'll do it];
And when white moths were on

00:18:21.007 --> 00:18:23.135
the wing,
And moth-like stars were

00:18:23.135 --> 00:18:28.089
flickering out,
I dropped the berry in a stream

00:18:28.089 --> 00:18:32.250
And caught a little silver
trout.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:37.579
When I had laid it on the floor
I went to blow the fire a-flame,

00:18:37.579 --> 00:18:39.849
But something rustled on the
floor,

00:18:39.849 --> 00:18:42.240
And someone called me by my
name:

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:49.090
It had become a glimmering girl
With apple blossom in her hair

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:54.373
Who called me by my name and ran
And faded through the

00:18:54.373 --> 00:18:59.759
brightening air.
Though I am old with wandering

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:03.299
Through hollow lands and hilly
lands,

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:06.750
I will find out where she is
gone,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.599
And kiss her lips and take her
hands;

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:13.880
And walk among long dappled
grass,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:18.420
And pluck till time and times
are done,

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:22.435
The silver apples of the moon,
The golden apples of the

00:19:22.435 --> 00:19:22.960
sun.
 

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:27.109
 
 

00:19:27.109 --> 00:19:31.918
It's rhymed iambic tetrameter,
four beats per line,

00:19:31.918 --> 00:19:34.130
with some variations.
 

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.200
It is a popular song form in
English.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:47.580
It's the way Puck and other
folk characters speak in

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:52.301
Shakespeare.
Its smoothness and its

00:19:52.301 --> 00:19:57.236
simplicity are associated with
folk forms, perhaps with the

00:19:57.236 --> 00:20:00.470
condition of enchantment or
trance,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:04.970
into which the speaker,
Aengus, falls.

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:07.259
The poem is a fairy tale.
 

00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:11.865
It's the story of Aengus'
longing and quest for union with

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:14.369
a fairy girl whom he desires.
 

00:20:14.369 --> 00:20:18.801
Yeats spoke of the poem as a
mad song, maybe not a kind of

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:23.776
mad song we would--it's not what
we would think of as a mad song,

00:20:23.776 --> 00:20:27.390
necessarily.
The poem imagines,

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:35.289
through a dramatic character,
Yeats's own coming to poetry,

00:20:35.289 --> 00:20:39.296
which he represents here both
as the undertaking of a

00:20:39.296 --> 00:20:43.842
specifically erotic quest and as
a sort of fury in the mind:

00:20:43.842 --> 00:20:47.700
"a fire was in my head,"
Aengus begins.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.220
Yeats wants us to share in,
as we attend to the sound of

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.740
his poem, a certain state of
enchantment and longing,

00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.124
which includes a feeling of
monotony, as we listen to those

00:21:01.124 --> 00:21:05.886
repeated phrases and images and
syntactic structures that always

00:21:05.886 --> 00:21:09.589
seem on the verge of redundance
in this poem.

00:21:09.589 --> 00:21:13.151
Think about how generalized,
how abstract,

00:21:13.151 --> 00:21:16.539
how unnatural nature is in this
poem.

00:21:16.539 --> 00:21:21.610
But then, it's exactly a poem
about nature transformed:

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.647
the fish who turns into the
glimmering girl,

00:21:25.647 --> 00:21:30.529
who, like any really marvelous
catch, gets away.

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:33.769
The transformation here,
importantly,

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:37.099
interrupts the eating of the
fruit;

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:40.309
consummation of desire is
deferred.

00:21:40.309 --> 00:21:45.119
Appetite gets sublimated and at
the same time deferred,

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:46.990
held in suspension.
 

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:50.530
The glimmering girl then calls
Aengus by name.

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.651
She names him.
She, in a sense,

00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:55.700
makes him Aengus.
 

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:01.235
Aengus is the Celtic name,
the Celtic master of love,

00:22:01.235 --> 00:22:05.920
a certain kind of Irish version
of Apollo.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.799
He's also a mortal who ages.
 

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:14.093
The poem describes a vocational
moment when the poet is called

00:22:14.093 --> 00:22:17.975
to his calling,
called to his calling in a way

00:22:17.975 --> 00:22:22.808
that amounts to a kind of
seduction, that lures him out

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:27.047
into the woods,
wandering as he follows this

00:22:27.047 --> 00:22:31.740
fish-woman and fairy girl,
who is a kind of muse,

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:36.067
or mother, too.
The quest is without end,

00:22:36.067 --> 00:22:38.789
it's even without direction.
 

00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:44.422
It has a goal,
however, that's described in

00:22:44.422 --> 00:22:46.970
that last stanza.
 

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:51.452
Contrast Yeats's old age and
the freshness of his desire in

00:22:51.452 --> 00:22:54.218
this poem.
He holds in dream the

00:22:54.218 --> 00:22:59.470
possibility of satisfied desire,
possession of the beloved;

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.364
meaning specifically physical
possession of her,

00:23:03.364 --> 00:23:07.921
which would be an apocalyptic
event, the end of time and

00:23:07.921 --> 00:23:11.872
times.
Yeats represents that moment of

00:23:11.872 --> 00:23:18.319
consummation as the plucking of
the silver and the gold apples.

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:24.097
Yeats was trained in the occult
disciplines of Theosophy and

00:23:24.097 --> 00:23:28.944
Gnosticism.
Those traditions merge in his

00:23:28.944 --> 00:23:35.601
early work with European
symbolism, and also with Irish

00:23:35.601 --> 00:23:38.559
cultural nationalism.
 

00:23:38.559 --> 00:23:43.720
Here, the gold and silver
apples are specifically

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.954
alchemical symbols of body and
soul, and a kind of mystical

00:23:49.954 --> 00:23:53.180
image of earthly paradise.
 

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.070
 
 

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.619
That's a nice touch.
 

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:02.080
But don't worry about these
symbols;

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.539
don't worry about them too much.
 

00:24:04.539 --> 00:24:10.221
Here, as elsewhere in Yeats'
poetry, it's not essential for

00:24:10.221 --> 00:24:15.902
you to be able to pursue his
occult learning and decode his

00:24:15.902 --> 00:24:19.819
symbols in order to read his
poetry.

00:24:19.819 --> 00:24:23.986
Jahan Ramazani,
who is the editor of The

00:24:23.986 --> 00:24:29.477
Norton and a great Yeatsian,
he himself has decided that all

00:24:29.477 --> 00:24:33.440
this is too much to explain and
you don't really need it.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:37.327
And fair enough.
The point is simply to

00:24:37.327 --> 00:24:41.423
recognize that the apples are
occult symbols,

00:24:41.423 --> 00:24:44.960
which is to say they're not
apples.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.000
They are rather images,
symbols, artifacts.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.182
And isn't that clear already
from their colors,

00:24:52.182 --> 00:24:53.890
the material that they're made
of?

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.666
Gold and silver,
these colors marked them as

00:24:57.666 --> 00:25:02.496
fashioned, precious objects,
inorganic, and in all these

00:25:02.496 --> 00:25:06.799
ways beyond time and nature,
growth or decay.

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:10.171
When Aengus or Yeats pursue
their desires,

00:25:10.171 --> 00:25:13.049
the object of desire – that
is,

00:25:13.049 --> 00:25:17.097
when they pursue a kind of
hoped for unity of being that

00:25:17.097 --> 00:25:20.996
the merging with the beloved
would constitute – this

00:25:20.996 --> 00:25:25.559
carries them out of the natural
world into a realm of high art,

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:29.416
of symbols.
The realization of desire for

00:25:29.416 --> 00:25:34.089
this young Yeats is something
only possible in art.

00:25:34.089 --> 00:25:40.670
In many ways Yeats retained
this aesthetic bias.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:45.813
This is Yeats rather later,
still dressed,

00:25:45.813 --> 00:25:51.960
however, in his study as an
aesthete and dandy.

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:58.450
You can see that wonderful coat
and silk bowtie.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:02.804
He began and ended his career
as a decadent,

00:26:02.804 --> 00:26:07.537
I suppose;
a reader of Walter Pater and

00:26:07.537 --> 00:26:11.886
Oscar Wilde.
Nonetheless – Oscar Wilde,

00:26:11.886 --> 00:26:17.028
a friend of Yeats –
nonetheless, Yeats's poetry does

00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:22.170
undergo an important and notable
stylistic change.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:25.431
When I said that there's a
story about Yeats's career that

00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:28.119
makes him out to be an exemplary
modern poet,

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:32.761
I had in mind how over the
course of this long career he

00:26:32.761 --> 00:26:38.163
leaves behind him that idealized
world of late nineteenth-century

00:26:38.163 --> 00:26:42.186
art for a more fully human,
realist poetry,

00:26:42.186 --> 00:26:46.501
one that, rhetorically,
strips away Yeats's own

00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:51.191
poeticisms and locates his
subjects in contemporary

00:26:51.191 --> 00:26:53.630
politics and history.
 

00:26:53.630 --> 00:27:00.451
This was the kind of
generalized story of Yeats's

00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:04.234
career.
Pound – Ezra Pound – is

00:27:04.234 --> 00:27:06.460
Yeats's younger friend.
 

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:09.378
Pound, you'll see,
keeps turning up in all of

00:27:09.378 --> 00:27:13.449
these stories.
He had a role in pushing Yeats

00:27:13.449 --> 00:27:16.960
in the direction in which he
went.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.349
He had also a big role in
publicizing Yeats's development.

00:27:22.349 --> 00:27:28.324
Here's a copy of a letter to
Pound by Yeats when they were

00:27:28.324 --> 00:27:30.839
both living in London.
 

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:37.970
This is at the Beinecke among
Pound's papers.

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:41.430
Oh, and here's the--This is
Yeats's letter.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.145
He's living,
at this point,

00:27:44.145 --> 00:27:47.904
at Woburn Place,
Yeats is, in London,

00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:54.380
where one of the bombs went off
in London two summers ago,

00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.150
right outside Yeats's house.
 

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:58.190
"My Dear Pound,
here is the poem.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:03.950
Many thanks for taking so much
trouble with it.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:08.640
Yours, W.B. Yeats."
 

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.961
Pound goes to work on Yeats,
goes to work on his poetry and

00:28:13.961 --> 00:28:17.757
helps modernize him,
although I think in lots of

00:28:17.757 --> 00:28:21.180
ways the influence went just as
much the other way.

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:26.686
The period of Pound's influence
coincides with Yeats's

00:28:26.686 --> 00:28:32.089
significantly titled book
Responsibilities.

00:28:32.089 --> 00:28:36.595
This is published in 1914,
which is the same year as

00:28:36.595 --> 00:28:39.509
Frost's North of Boston.
 

00:28:39.509 --> 00:28:43.799
These two books are coming out
at the same moment in London.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:48.480
Some of the poems in this book
dramatize, dramatize and

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:52.900
describe the stylistic changes
I'm talking about.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:57.028
For instance,
the short poem,

00:28:57.028 --> 00:29:01.355
"A Coat."
Here it is; it's in your

00:29:01.355 --> 00:29:05.360
anthology as well:
I made my song a coat

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.560
Covered with embroideries
Out of old mythologies

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.400
From heel to throat;
But the fools caught it,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.970
Wore it in the world's eye
As though they'd wrought it.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.530
Song, let them take it
For there's more enterprise

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:27.632
In walking naked.
Yeats is throwing off his early

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:31.839
work as if throwing off a kind
of costume.

00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:36.430
All that King Goll crap that he
had on, he's tossing it off.

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:41.150
The embroidery and decoration,
all that now seems inauthentic,

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.555
something that,
in fact, Yeats's audience had

00:29:44.555 --> 00:29:49.128
failed to value properly;
he's complaining here in this

00:29:49.128 --> 00:29:51.976
poem.
In this short poem,

00:29:51.976 --> 00:29:58.703
he is referring to the vexed
efforts by himself and his

00:29:58.703 --> 00:30:00.946
collaborators,
J.M.

00:30:00.946 --> 00:30:08.171
Synge and Lady Augusta Gregory,
to create an Irish national

00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:13.418
theater.
Yeats sought a popular audience

00:30:13.418 --> 00:30:18.430
for his poetry,
in part through his work in the

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:23.116
theater, but he became
disenchanted with the

00:30:23.116 --> 00:30:28.731
theater-going public;
with imitators and detractors,

00:30:28.731 --> 00:30:32.069
too, all of whom,
as he puts it here,

00:30:32.069 --> 00:30:34.109
caught at his coat.
 

00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:44.140
This is a poem that declares
nakedness as a poetic value.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.460
It's a kind of semi-official
announcement that Yeats is

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:53.099
giving up his early manner,
precisely because it seems like

00:30:53.099 --> 00:30:55.339
a manner and a disguise.
 

00:30:55.339 --> 00:30:59.466
In doing so,
Yeats might have seemed to be

00:30:59.466 --> 00:31:03.089
moving closer to the Irish
people,

00:31:03.089 --> 00:31:08.576
in a move something like
Frost's foreswearing of the

00:31:08.576 --> 00:31:12.880
poetry of dream and elves and
fairies,

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:19.049
in favor of a poetry of fact.
 

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:26.267
And let's keep in mind Frost's
own wish to create a poetry that

00:31:26.267 --> 00:31:33.950
would reach ordinary people and
would reach all kinds and sorts.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:39.715
Again, it might seem that Yeats
is interested in something like

00:31:39.715 --> 00:31:43.807
this too and,
again, in this same moment that

00:31:43.807 --> 00:31:47.900
Frost is publishing his work in
England.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.569
But there's a difference in
Yeats.

00:31:50.569 --> 00:31:56.532
He adopts this ideal of
nakedness precisely as a

00:31:56.532 --> 00:32:01.099
repudiation of a popular
audience.

00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:04.199
It's a kind of dare,
demonstrating not just his

00:32:04.199 --> 00:32:08.040
indifference to the crowd but in
fact his scorn for it.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.370
"I'm going to walk naked.
 

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.970
I'm not going to dress for you."
 

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:17.972
Yeats's early poetry is elite
because it is high,

00:32:17.972 --> 00:32:22.349
aristocratic,
ideal in character.

00:32:22.349 --> 00:32:25.870
The middle poetry,
the poetry that begins with the

00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:29.319
volume Responsibilities,
remains elite;

00:32:29.319 --> 00:32:32.299
only now, its elitism will be
expressed differently.

00:32:32.299 --> 00:32:35.553
It will be expressed in a
rhetoric of nakedness,

00:32:35.553 --> 00:32:38.460
or what Yeats will also call
"coldness."

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:44.349
 
 

00:32:44.349 --> 00:32:51.817
"The Fisherman":
"The Fisherman" is another poem

00:32:51.817 --> 00:33:00.873
from this volume that both
comments on and exemplifies the

00:33:00.873 --> 00:33:07.069
transformation that I'm
describing,

00:33:07.069 --> 00:33:13.940
the transformation of Yeats's
style and values.

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:19.279
It suggests both the difference
between the earlier Yeats and

00:33:19.279 --> 00:33:22.610
the middle Yeats,
but also, importantly,

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:27.085
the kinds of continuity between
them, the ways in which Yeats

00:33:27.085 --> 00:33:29.770
remained very much the same
poet.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:30.860
Let me read it for you.
 

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:37.759
 
 

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:40.230
Although I can see him
still

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:44.900
The freckled man who goes
To a grey place on a hill

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:51.820
In grey Connemara clothes
At dawn to cast his flies,

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.240
It's long since I began
To call up to the eyes

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:59.330
This wise and simple man.
 

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:05.630
All day I'd looked in the face
What I had hoped 'twould be

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:11.960
To write for my own race
And the reality;

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.450
The living men that I hate,
The dead man that I loved,

00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:22.930
The craven man in his seat,
The insolent unreproved

00:34:22.930 --> 00:34:27.320
And no knave brought to book
Who has won a drunken cheer,

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.090
The witty man and his joke
Aimed at the commonest ear,

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:37.190
The clever man who cries
The catch-cries of the clown,

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:43.460
The beating down of the wise
And great Art beaten down.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:50.456
Well, Yeats begins in scorn of
an audience that's unable to

00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:55.039
recognize true wisdom and great
art.

00:34:55.039 --> 00:35:01.342
In scorn of that audience,
he imagines another audience,

00:35:01.342 --> 00:35:06.383
another audience to write for
and to emulate,

00:35:06.383 --> 00:35:11.540
an audience represented by the
fisherman.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.570
What is the fisherman like?
 

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.360
What does he represent?
 

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.710
What values does he embody?
 

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:28.624
Grayness – grayness that
suggests the color of a land and

00:35:28.624 --> 00:35:35.719
a culture, the color of stone,
of peasant clothes.

00:35:35.719 --> 00:35:41.795
He, the fisherman,
is a solitary figure in a

00:35:41.795 --> 00:35:47.164
landscape of stone,
stone that is dark,

00:35:47.164 --> 00:35:52.815
resistant, apparently
non-ideal; that is,

00:35:52.815 --> 00:35:56.085
real.
Contrast this place,

00:35:56.085 --> 00:36:00.288
this way of imagining Ireland,
what Ireland means,

00:36:00.288 --> 00:36:03.719
with the sensual landscape of
Aengus,

00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:09.150
with the unreality of the world
of that earlier poem.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:13.522
In a sense, the earlier poem,
"The Song of the Wandering

00:36:13.522 --> 00:36:18.610
Aengus," transformed the Irish
landscape into a place of myth,

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:25.306
in the same way that the poem
is describing the transformation

00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:28.489
of the trout into the girl.
 

00:36:28.489 --> 00:36:34.401
Yeats seems to be reversing
this trick in "The Fisherman,"

00:36:34.401 --> 00:36:39.380
seems to be converting myth back
into reality,

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:46.130
the ideal object of desire from
a glimmering girl back into a

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.291
trout.
The poem represents a kind of

00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:53.737
– as does the short poem,
"A Coat" – represents a kind

00:36:53.737 --> 00:36:57.710
of ascetic move,
an active imaginative and

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.400
rhetorical stripping-down.
 

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:06.765
The landscape itself in,
here in Yeats's poem,

00:37:06.765 --> 00:37:12.989
seems naked,
barren, probably un-tillable,

00:37:12.989 --> 00:37:17.888
and the poetry that Yeats wants
from this place will be,

00:37:17.888 --> 00:37:21.540
as it seems,
as he goes on to describe,

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.910
cold and passionate.
 

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.620
Let me finish the poem here.
 

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:32.170
Maybe a twelvemonth since
Suddenly I began,

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:36.682
In scorn of this audience [that
Yeats has been describing,

00:37:36.682 --> 00:37:40.606
this audience
associated with the Dublin

00:37:40.606 --> 00:37:44.710
middle class and theater-going
public]

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:48.770
Imagining a man,
And his sun-freckled face,

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:53.440
And grey Connemara cloth,
Climbing up to a place

00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.840
Where stone is dark under froth,
And the down turn of his wrist

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:02.710
When the flies drop in the
stream;

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:08.430
A man who does not exist,
A man who is but a dream;

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.120
And cried, "Before I am old
I shall have written him one

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:16.342
Poem maybe, as cold
And passionate as the

00:38:16.342 --> 00:38:20.727
dawn."
The poetry that Yeats wants

00:38:20.727 --> 00:38:25.613
from this place,
the place that the fisherman

00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:29.832
takes him to,
it's going to be cold and

00:38:29.832 --> 00:38:33.829
passionate, as he describes it.
 

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:37.732
You can see him,
in a sense – Yeats,

00:38:37.732 --> 00:38:43.639
cooling the fire in the head of
Aengus at this moment.

00:38:43.639 --> 00:38:49.781
The poem identifies also cold
and passion with dawn,

00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:55.681
the moment of awakening,
which is also a moment of

00:38:55.681 --> 00:39:01.099
coming into reality from dream
and sleep.

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:07.491
Yeats--the kind of rhetorical
and stylistic transformation I'm

00:39:07.491 --> 00:39:12.519
describing identified with
Yeats's modernness,

00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:18.964
his coming into modernity,
has these qualities and is

00:39:18.964 --> 00:39:24.170
associated here powerfully with
morning.

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:29.369
Importantly,
though, morning and dawn are

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:33.789
also seen as moments of passion.
 

00:39:33.789 --> 00:39:40.004
If Aengus is a figure of
passion, so, interestingly,

00:39:40.004 --> 00:39:42.320
is the fisherman.
 

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:47.980
It's only what it means to
write a poetry of passion that

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.619
Yeats is now beginning to
rethink.

00:39:51.619 --> 00:39:58.025
Passion seems to lie in
coldness rather than heat,

00:39:58.025 --> 00:40:06.130
lies exactly in the restraining
and disciplining of passion.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.270
In this sense,
"The Fisherman" is not,

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:14.362
after all, a poem that's very
different from "The Song of the

00:40:14.362 --> 00:40:16.230
Wandering Aengus."
 

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:22.139
In fact, Yeats is still writing
about a solitary fisherman.

00:40:22.139 --> 00:40:28.682
And just as in that earlier
poem, the act of fishing is

00:40:28.682 --> 00:40:31.590
symbolically resonant.
 

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:35.947
"The Fisherman" is an image of
man searching the depths of the

00:40:35.947 --> 00:40:40.520
world for the wisdom that hides
beneath the surface of things.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:45.949
 
 

00:40:45.949 --> 00:40:51.660
Fishing is seen here,
as in the earlier poem,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:57.630
as an image of quest and an
image of desire.

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.862
For all these reasons,
"The Fisherman" is really a

00:41:01.862 --> 00:41:05.750
re-writing and even a kind of
continuation,

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:10.837
rather than a repudiation,
of "The Song of the Wandering

00:41:10.837 --> 00:41:14.630
Aengus" and the poems from that
period.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:23.500
In fact, as Yeats declares,
the fisherman does not exist.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.739
It's a wonderful sentence,
isn't it?

00:41:25.739 --> 00:41:32.210
"A man who does not exist,
/ a man who is but a dream."

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:37.510
Yeats is still writing dream.
 

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:42.599
The man is not a real man,
the man is a symbol;

00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:45.571
only this time,
a symbol of the real,

00:41:45.571 --> 00:41:50.359
a symbol of the actual and
local, of the Irish race and the

00:41:50.359 --> 00:41:53.566
reality.
And the poetry that he stands

00:41:53.566 --> 00:41:57.541
for – that the fisherman
stands for – like all of

00:41:57.541 --> 00:42:01.210
Yeats's poetry,
is a poetry again of symbols.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:05.728
The fisherman is also
representative of the Irish

00:42:05.728 --> 00:42:11.753
peasantry to whom Yeats turns in
scorn of the urban audience that

00:42:11.753 --> 00:42:15.989
he had tried to write for in the
theater.

00:42:15.989 --> 00:42:18.808
This is, again,
not a break with the

00:42:18.808 --> 00:42:23.881
aristocratic values of the early
poetry but an aligning of those

00:42:23.881 --> 00:42:28.552
values with an ideal image of
the peasant classes with whom

00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:32.659
Yeats creates a kind of
imaginative bond against the

00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:37.007
bourgeois people who seem to
represent the new order of

00:42:37.007 --> 00:42:40.389
things – modernity and Dublin.
 

00:42:40.389 --> 00:42:47.352
Yeats's sense of modern
history, of the crisis of his

00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:55.385
moment – this is something we
can describe and explore next

00:42:55.385 --> 00:42:59.000
time, in "Easter 1916."
 

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:10.024
Before we finish today,
let me just connect "The

00:43:10.024 --> 00:43:24.099
Fisherman" and its images of
cold passion to another poem –

00:43:24.099 --> 00:43:34.624
the elegy for Robert Gregory,
Yeats's friend,

00:43:34.624 --> 00:43:43.908
Augustus Gregory's son,
who dies in the First World

00:43:43.908 --> 00:43:52.349
War, an airman.
Yeats here evokes Gregory as a

00:43:52.349 --> 00:44:01.190
kind of fallen representative of
Irish culture and of

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:07.312
aristocratic culture,
in particular,

00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:16.210
in which art and eloquence and
political and cultural life all

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:24.380
co-exist and all combine and
form a passionate heart.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:33.532
Yeats evokes Gregory's death
and sees it in relation to other

00:44:33.532 --> 00:44:41.159
friends and collaborators of
Yeats's early life,

00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:45.989
including Lionel Johnson and
Synge and others.

00:44:45.989 --> 00:44:52.510
This is, again,
Gregory representing a kind of

00:44:52.510 --> 00:45:00.335
aristocratic elegance and
culture that is juxtaposed to

00:45:00.335 --> 00:45:09.030
– will be juxtaposed to –
the revolutionary violence that

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:17.435
comes to shatter the Irish
capitol in 1916 and in many ways

00:45:17.435 --> 00:45:25.695
reshapes Yeats's career as he
encounters what he calls the

00:45:25.695 --> 00:45:33.809
"terrible beauty" of that
explosive rebellion.

00:45:33.809 --> 00:45:40.339
Well, that's enough for today,
and we'll continue with Yeats

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:42.000
on Wednesday.

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.304
Professor John Rogers:
Readers typically finish

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:08.790
the last books of Paradise
Lost with -- I don't know,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.967
I certainly had this experience
the first time I read it and,

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:18.799
I think, actually many times
since then -- with something

00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:23.911
like a sense of disappointment,
and the disappointment that has

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:28.161
traditionally accompanied these
last books is usually associated

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.590
with the question of their
style.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.582
Michael's prophetic vision of
future history is laid out

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:38.866
before Adam with -- and you get
this sense -- with a kind of

00:00:38.866 --> 00:00:41.770
labored and painstaking
didacticism.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.339
We so miss Raphael, I think.
The affable Raphael had charmed

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.496
us with that endearing
uncertainty that he had about

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.220
the structure of the cosmos,
for example.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.000
Was Ptolemy right?
Was Copernicus right?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.605
Who cares?
Raphael made an art out of his

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.889
uncertainty, and he seemed to
place his blessing thereby on

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.804
all of the ambiguities and all
of the ambivalences and

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:10.310
uncertainties that filled nearly
every line of the poem.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.016
But everything,
or nearly everything,

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:19.680
changes with the appearance of
the Archangel Michael.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.345
Michael's speech is much less
open -- there's no question

00:01:23.345 --> 00:01:27.470
about this -- to a proliferation
of signifying possibilities.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.830
He speaks in labored,
declarative sentences and his

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.460
purpose seems above all to
provide Adam with a powerful

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.594
sense of his culpability,
Adam's culpability,

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:39.900
for the hell that is future
history.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.948
I mean actually hell quite
literally because there's an

00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:46.336
important way in which the last
two books of Paradise Lost

00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:49.950
provide us with a kind of
mirror of the first two books.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.272
The catalog of fallen history
that we have at the poem's

00:01:53.272 --> 00:01:56.655
conclusion reproduces and
rehearses a lot of the patterns

00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:59.615
of behavior that were
established in the first two

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.532
books.
David's lecture on Friday has

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:07.069
made me think of the ways in
which sometimes what seems to be

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.758
the futility of human action and
human behavior in the last two

00:02:11.758 --> 00:02:16.068
books also harkens back to an
earlier time even before the

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:20.530
events recounted in Books One
and Two -- and that's,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.840
of course, the war in heaven.
The pointlessness of the war in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.672
heaven on some level gets
reproduced in -- in the sense

00:02:28.672 --> 00:02:33.001
that we have sometimes of-- the
pointlessness of life [laughs]

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.408
after the Fall in the last
couple of books of the

00:02:36.408 --> 00:02:39.460
poem.But like the war in
heaven,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.510
there is a kind of heroism
that's possible in the last two

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.975
books of Paradise Lost.
I won't be talking about

00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:49.504
this at any length,
but it's an important part of

00:02:49.504 --> 00:02:52.613
Milton's conception of history
and it's often referred to as

00:02:52.613 --> 00:02:55.090
Milton's "one just man" theory
of history.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.546
Every generation seems to have
one man who is willing to stand

00:02:59.546 --> 00:03:03.710
alone and stand apart from the
corruption of the crowd,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.107
and that man will do everything
he possibly can -- on some level

00:03:08.107 --> 00:03:12.504
it's still going to be futile --
to advance the civilization and

00:03:12.504 --> 00:03:16.063
the level of spiritual
excellence of the people that

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:19.639
much further.
The one just man in the war in

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.240
heaven was, of course,
the angel Abdiel with whom

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.290
Milton himself felt himself so
identified.Well,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.496
in any case, think of Book Ten.
Book Ten had been filled with a

00:03:31.496 --> 00:03:35.629
catalog of the punishments that
Adam and Eve had to endure as a

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.186
consequence of their behavior,
but it seems at times as if the

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:44.746
harshest punishment of all that
comes as a consequence of the

00:03:44.746 --> 00:03:49.306
Fall will be Adam's subjection
to the catechism of Michael in

00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:53.322
Books Eleven and Twelve.
Adam is subjected to an

00:03:53.322 --> 00:03:57.500
instructor, an instructor whose
grim sense of humor,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.186
whose abrasive sarcasm,
and whose unfeeling didacticism

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:03.780
all contribute,
at least to my mind,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.381
to a sensibility utterly
foreign to that of the first

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:10.240
[laughs]
ten books.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.926
If we as the sons and daughters
of Adam and Eve are to be

00:04:14.926 --> 00:04:19.528
punished, it seems as if we,
too, are to be punished for

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:22.310
that original sin.
How are we punished?

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.399
We're punished because if we
want to finish this stupid poem

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:33.870
we have an obligation to read
and experience Michael's

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.972
uncompromising pedagogy,
his teaching of Adam.Now,

00:04:38.972 --> 00:04:43.702
the literary style of the last
books may be that aspect of them

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:46.829
that first incites our
disappointment,

00:04:46.829 --> 00:04:50.251
but it's certainly not the only
disappointing element of those

00:04:50.251 --> 00:04:52.158
books.
We're also disappointed with

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:55.126
the actual content -- I'm
disappointed with the content of

00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:59.163
Michael's history.
I will continually be harkening

00:04:59.163 --> 00:05:04.766
back to Raphael who seems so
much more affable in retrospect

00:05:04.766 --> 00:05:09.967
than maybe he did at the time.
We remember Raphael's teasing

00:05:09.967 --> 00:05:12.820
account of future history in
Book Five.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.936
You'll remember this.
If Adam and Eve could only

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:17.162
remain sinless,
if they could only remain

00:05:17.162 --> 00:05:20.172
obedient,
then their future might consist

00:05:20.172 --> 00:05:24.178
of that grand but slow
transmutation into the ethereal

00:05:24.178 --> 00:05:28.075
matter of angels.
It was really quite beautiful,

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:31.414
but Adam and Eve,
of course, did not remain

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:35.788
sinless and their future history
necessarily has to look

00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:40.161
disappointingly different from
that natural history that

00:05:40.161 --> 00:05:45.250
Raphael had been able to
anticipate.Now most critics,

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.086
most Milton scholars writing
about the last two books of

00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:50.768
Milton's poem have invested
their time -- and you can

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:53.966
understand why this is necessary
-- have invested their time in

00:05:53.966 --> 00:05:56.029
defending books Eleven and
Twelve,

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:00.050
and there's a certain kind of
nervousness about the

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.910
unpleasantness of the conclusion
of this poem.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.114
Critics are continually -- and
I think this is misguided,

00:06:07.114 --> 00:06:10.147
but I understand it nonetheless
-- they're continually

00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:13.466
attempting to shelter the poem
from the accusation that its

00:06:13.466 --> 00:06:17.300
ending represents something like
a disappointing falling off.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.914
Now I think these critics are
right, they're absolutely right,

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:26.378
to insist that the last books
are supremely artful creations

00:06:26.378 --> 00:06:30.841
-- that's undeniable -- and that
Milton displays in them his

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:34.623
sophisticated engagement of
biblical history and of

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:38.413
theology.
Milton takes extraordinary care

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:42.936
in crafting the process of the
education to which Adam is

00:06:42.936 --> 00:06:46.807
subjected in the last books.
That said, I think it's a

00:06:46.807 --> 00:06:50.198
mistake, or I'm convinced it's a
mistake, to deny the fact that

00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:52.550
these books are,
in addition to all of that,

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.310
disappointing.
So I think we can profitably

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.945
examine why it is that Milton
ends his poem with these last

00:07:01.945 --> 00:07:04.911
books,
Michael's severe treatise on

00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:09.169
scriptural history.Now,
these last books mark Milton's

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.801
only attempt in Paradise Lost
to represent what we would

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:16.639
think of as actual human
history.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:20.720
In order to understand why this
section of the poem is so

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.588
troubled and so worrisome,
we have to understand Milton's

00:07:24.588 --> 00:07:27.695
own brush with history,
his own participation in the

00:07:27.695 --> 00:07:31.230
disappointing history of the
failed Puritan Revolution.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:35.415
Now Milton has taken great
pains to keep from his poem

00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:40.312
anything like a direct allusion
to the political turmoil of his

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:43.275
own day,
but what I am hoping I'll be

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:46.369
able to do, at least for a few
minutes here,

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:50.472
is to show one of the ways in
which Michael's treatment of

00:07:50.472 --> 00:07:54.358
scriptural history is still
intimately connected to the

00:07:54.358 --> 00:07:58.820
contemporary political history
that Milton was himself enmeshed

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.178
in.Now,
you may have noticed that the

00:08:02.178 --> 00:08:05.816
work of Milton's political prose
by far that I have most

00:08:05.816 --> 00:08:09.586
consistently cited over the
course of these lectures -- or

00:08:09.586 --> 00:08:12.364
written little things on the
board [laughs]

00:08:12.364 --> 00:08:15.540
in quotation of it -- is
Areopagitica,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.023
 the speech against
licensing that Milton had

00:08:19.023 --> 00:08:22.317
printed in 1644.
There's a way in which that

00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:25.702
exuberant liberalism of
Areopagitica was

00:08:25.702 --> 00:08:29.750
continually resurfacing in the
most interesting and,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.899
in a lot of cases,
the most daring passages of the

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:35.914
entire poem.
We remember instances in which

00:08:35.914 --> 00:08:39.721
Belial and, at another point,
Eve seemed to be actually

00:08:39.721 --> 00:08:43.599
alluding to Areopagitica
or certainly reproducing

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.559
arguments that Milton had made
there,

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:47.914
and so I devoted a lot of
attention to

00:08:47.914 --> 00:08:50.745
Areopagitica;
but in doing so I think I've

00:08:50.745 --> 00:08:53.710
also distorted,
maybe kind of drastically,

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.471
the truth about Milton's
political sensibility in the

00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:00.436
very years that he was writing
Paradise

00:09:00.436 --> 00:09:05.210
Lost.Milton's epic poem
appeared over twenty years,

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.875
or twenty-three years,
after the treatise on

00:09:07.875 --> 00:09:12.243
licensing;
I've given you a sketch of this

00:09:12.243 --> 00:09:17.269
history before,
but it's worth looking at at

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:20.282
another time.
In the mid 1640s,

00:09:20.282 --> 00:09:24.381
Milton was really at the height
of what we can think of as his

00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:28.480
liberalism, even though that
word wasn't yet in existence.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.900
Milton was wildly optimistic
about the success of what he

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:34.100
felt to be the Puritan
Revolution,

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.290
and he seemed genuinely
confident that something like a

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:41.009
rational, spiritual,
Puritan utopia could actually

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:46.371
be established on English soil.
At the center of his political

00:09:46.371 --> 00:09:51.666
optimism was his faith in the
political category that Milton

00:09:51.666 --> 00:09:55.318
called "the people."
When he was writing in Latin,

00:09:55.318 --> 00:09:57.510
he would use the Latin for
people,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.833
which is populus.
Throughout the 1640s,

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:05.309
up to 1650, Milton was
confident, really exuberantly

00:10:05.309 --> 00:10:08.363
confident,
that God had infused the power

00:10:08.363 --> 00:10:12.382
of reason and virtue into every
single human individual and that

00:10:12.382 --> 00:10:16.018
this God-given capacity for
reason and virtue would enable

00:10:16.018 --> 00:10:19.051
the English people,
the populus,

00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:23.240
to govern themselves in an
entirely non-authoritarian,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:27.983
almost completely egalitarian
political structure.I think

00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:32.883
you can see most dramatically --
and this is a treatise that we

00:10:32.883 --> 00:10:37.223
haven't read in this course,
but it's included in the

00:10:37.223 --> 00:10:41.027
Hughes -- you can see
this faith in the self-rule of

00:10:41.027 --> 00:10:43.649
the people in Milton's 1649
treatise,

00:10:43.649 --> 00:10:46.438
really the greatest of all of
what we call the regicide

00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:49.330
treatises: The Tenure of
Kings and Magistrates,

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.483
 in which Milton
actually actively advocates the

00:10:53.483 --> 00:10:55.784
regicide.
There's almost a sense in

00:10:55.784 --> 00:10:59.044
The Tenure of Kings and
Magistrates that you don't

00:10:59.044 --> 00:11:02.536
even really need any kind of
formal governmental structure at

00:11:02.536 --> 00:11:05.804
all.
The people are actually going

00:11:05.804 --> 00:11:10.347
to be able to govern themselves
without any other

00:11:10.347 --> 00:11:14.889
edifice.There turned out to
be a problem,

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:17.576
however, with Milton's
political idealism,

00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:21.246
and that problem no doubt
involved the fact that Milton's

00:11:21.246 --> 00:11:25.112
political idealism seemed to
have had no basis whatsoever in

00:11:25.112 --> 00:11:28.575
reality.
Milton may have been convinced

00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:33.155
that God had infused every
single human individual with

00:11:33.155 --> 00:11:36.210
this power of rational
self-rule,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.440
but the actual people,
the actual populus of

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.799
England, turned out not to be so
easily convinced.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:46.192
The real English people
themselves were considerably

00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:50.448
more conservative than the small
Puritan elite who had pushed for

00:11:50.448 --> 00:11:54.439
the execution of Charles the
First in 1649 and who had placed

00:11:54.439 --> 00:11:57.100
themselves at the head of the
new,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.899
non-monarchic,
republican government.

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:02.763
If anything,
the majority of the English

00:12:02.763 --> 00:12:06.139
people themselves were in favor
of monarchy,

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:09.659
and so Milton found himself,
as so often,

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:13.970
compelled to modify his own
political idealism.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:19.370
By 1650, Milton wasn't able to
say that the English should be

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.610
governed by the people -- by
1651,

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:25.527
I should say,
he was no longer able to say

00:12:25.527 --> 00:12:29.513
that, that on some level the
people obviously couldn't be

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:33.569
trusted any longer to get it
right.So he had to weaken

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:38.480
his claim that the people were
all rational and self-governing.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:43.129
He began to forward a much less
idealistic principle of

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:48.295
government, and that was the
government of England by a small

00:12:48.295 --> 00:12:52.169
elected body of people called
Parliament.

00:12:52.169 --> 00:12:54.985
Parliament had existed well
before Milton,

00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:58.830
before this new turn in
Milton's political philosophy,

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:03.372
but Milton was placing an
entirely new importance on this

00:13:03.372 --> 00:13:05.673
body.
So maybe the people themselves

00:13:05.673 --> 00:13:09.139
aren't all that rational and
virtuous and self-determining,

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:12.835
capable of self-government,
but surely Parliament -- this

00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:16.530
is the new turn in Milton's
thinking -- an elite group of

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.861
the people,
can be counted on to uphold

00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:25.152
Milton's own value of rational
self-determination and rational

00:13:25.152 --> 00:13:29.090
self-rule.Well,
the republican decade wears on,

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.019
the 1650s, and by the time we
get to the end of the decade,

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:35.958
the kingless government of
England -- under the rule of

00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.223
Oliver Cromwell and later under
the rule of Cromwell's son --

00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:42.434
this republican government is
getting closer and closer to a

00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:45.555
complete collapse.
There's a widespread popular

00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:49.121
movement: it's a movement
fomented by the people seeking

00:13:49.121 --> 00:13:51.519
the return of the Stuart
monarchy,

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:54.955
and this time it's not only the
common people who are calling

00:13:54.955 --> 00:13:58.913
for the return of their king.
It's also Parliament who has --

00:13:58.913 --> 00:14:02.716
from Milton's perspective,
Parliament has entirely sold

00:14:02.716 --> 00:14:04.744
out;
and so by late 1659,

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:09.425
there is a majority now even in
Parliament desiring -- this is

00:14:09.425 --> 00:14:14.182
again Milton's construction of
it -- desiring to re-subject the

00:14:14.182 --> 00:14:18.786
English people to the tyranny of
monarchy.So in 1659 when

00:14:18.786 --> 00:14:22.929
Milton is writing his final
political treatise,

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:26.225
he's compelled to alter his
views once again,

00:14:26.225 --> 00:14:30.120
and he finds very little
evidence of the rational,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.295
virtuous, ethical principles
that he had been so confident

00:14:33.295 --> 00:14:36.936
about in Areopagitica,
this idea that all human

00:14:36.936 --> 00:14:41.437
individuals possess the virtue
and the reason and the spirit

00:14:41.437 --> 00:14:44.870
that he had previously
attributed to them.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:50.240
It starts to seem as if all men
are actually not created equal

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:55.523
and that very few of them have
anything like divine virtue or

00:14:55.523 --> 00:14:59.309
divine reason infused into them
by God.

00:14:59.309 --> 00:15:03.244
So now the people that Milton
had once so wonderfully and

00:15:03.244 --> 00:15:06.198
movingly idealized,
he's able to refer to -- and

00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:08.679
it's really kind of jarring and,
just frankly,

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:12.022
it's depressing -- Milton's now
able to refer to the people as

00:15:12.022 --> 00:15:14.049
the -- and I'm quoting here
–

00:15:14.049 --> 00:15:18.220
"the rude and inconsiderate
multitude," the unruly mob.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:26.413
You have a whole elaborate
lexicon of invectives concerning

00:15:26.413 --> 00:15:35.453
the people in the last political
treatises of Milton's.Milton

00:15:35.453 --> 00:15:39.363
imagines,
because he can't even count on

00:15:39.363 --> 00:15:43.649
Parliament -- he comes to insist
that the unruly and irrational

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:45.507
English,
these masses,

00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:48.629
are ungovernable even by
Parliament.

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:52.750
So the governing body is going
to have to be an even smaller

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.221
group, a collection of England's
most rational and most spiritual

00:15:57.221 --> 00:15:58.943
men,
men of course,

00:15:58.943 --> 00:16:02.352
who look exactly like John
Milton himself:

00:16:02.352 --> 00:16:06.842
so a group of men more
excellent than the far-too-large

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.750
mass of people that constitute
Parliament.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.720
You have something like what's
essentially a spiritual elite.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.596
This spiritual elite would have
to govern England,

00:16:17.596 --> 00:16:20.590
and Milton thinks of them as a
council of saints;

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.659
he refers to them as a council
of saints.

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:27.882
So in a little more than a
decade this political idealist

00:16:27.882 --> 00:16:32.709
has shifted from his celebration
of the power and the liberty due

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:37.158
to the people to a depressingly
shriveled sense -- and it is

00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:41.456
pretty shrunk and pretty pitiful
thing -- of the power and

00:16:41.456 --> 00:16:45.981
liberty only due to a very small
group of like-minded Puritan

00:16:45.981 --> 00:16:50.732
revolutionaries.So a lot of
the liberal confidence of a work

00:16:50.732 --> 00:16:55.331
like Areopagitica just
disappears by the time we get to

00:16:55.331 --> 00:17:01.444
Milton's late political prose.
Just how depressing this shift

00:17:01.444 --> 00:17:07.312
is will become clear to you when
-- have I assigned The Ready

00:17:07.312 --> 00:17:12.435
and Easy Way to Establish a Free
Commonwealth on the

00:17:12.435 --> 00:17:15.722
syllabus?
I may have taken it off this

00:17:15.722 --> 00:17:20.042
year because I did not want to
depress you, but you should not

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:24.362
let my attempt to protect you
from what might seem the ugliest

00:17:24.362 --> 00:17:28.469
parts of Milton from taking
advantage of Hughes's inclusion

00:17:28.469 --> 00:17:31.656
of that important and
interesting text in your

00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:34.364
edition.
Milton will argue in The

00:17:34.364 --> 00:17:37.539
Ready and Easy Way that he
wrote in 1659 that this new

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:41.314
spiritual council,
the council of saints,

00:17:41.314 --> 00:17:47.353
they should actually be
permitted to deploy military

00:17:47.353 --> 00:17:55.049
force if necessary to subject
the unruly masses to their will.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:17:59.057
This is how the argument goes,
and it's a disconcerting one:

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:03.269
the people are now so little to
be trusted that they have to be

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:07.616
forced to recognize,
at gunpoint if necessary,

00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:12.723
their God-given liberty and
their God--;[laughs]

00:18:12.723 --> 00:18:17.824
given capacity for self-rule.
Of course, it goes without

00:18:17.824 --> 00:18:20.509
question there's a horrible
paradox there.

00:18:20.509 --> 00:18:23.703
Milton seems to be arguing that
the people will govern

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:27.628
themselves -- goddammit!
-- even if they have to be

00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:32.798
forced to do it.So this
final plan -- this is Milton's

00:18:32.798 --> 00:18:37.605
final political scheme -- is
something like a junta of

00:18:37.605 --> 00:18:41.535
Puritan saints.
Of course, the scheme was never

00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:44.079
enacted.
Shortly after Milton proposed

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:47.937
it, the republican government
completely collapsed in early

00:18:47.937 --> 00:18:50.103
1660,
and Charles the Second,

00:18:50.103 --> 00:18:53.654
the dead king's son,
was returned to the throne and

00:18:53.654 --> 00:18:57.170
monarchy was restored.
And Milton -- think about the

00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.384
position that he's in.
Milton was actually placed in

00:19:00.384 --> 00:19:03.799
prison for a while for his
writings against the king,

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:07.348
and he was generally living in
some degree of poverty and

00:19:07.348 --> 00:19:11.276
certainly in disgrace.All of
this is a very long-winded way

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:15.078
of saying we have come a long
way by the time we get actually

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:17.930
to the composition of
Paradise Lost.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:21.866
We've come a very long way
from the moving idealism of

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:24.995
Areopagitica.
Milton has endured an

00:19:24.995 --> 00:19:29.294
entire decade of political
disappointment and I think it's

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:33.820
possible to see the relation
between the fall of Milton's own

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.270
political idealism over the
course of a decade and a half or

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:43.549
so and the fall of man as it's
represented in Paradise Lost.

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:47.555
Milton's able to use the
narrative of the fall of

00:19:47.555 --> 00:19:50.019
paradise in some way,
I think,

00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:55.476
to map his own experience with
the loss of the English

00:19:55.476 --> 00:19:59.800
commonwealth,
the English commonwealth that

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.257
Milton had really seen as
something like a paradise of

00:20:05.257 --> 00:20:11.331
Puritan saints.You could
think of Adam and Eve after the

00:20:11.331 --> 00:20:14.347
Fall,
in a lot of ways at least,

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.959
as a version of the English
people for Milton in the late

00:20:17.959 --> 00:20:20.688
1650s.
They show surprisingly few

00:20:20.688 --> 00:20:25.730
signs of internalized divine
reason and internalized virtue,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:31.057
and so this is why -- at least,
I think this is why Milton has

00:20:31.057 --> 00:20:35.861
to introduce into his narrative
this irritable Archangel

00:20:35.861 --> 00:20:38.967
Michael,
and this is why Milton stages

00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:42.657
this scene of angelic
instruction so differently from

00:20:42.657 --> 00:20:45.779
the way he staged the scene with
Raphael.

00:20:45.779 --> 00:20:48.589
I only need to mention Eve's
role in all of this.

00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:52.414
Eve, you'll remember,
decided on her own not to stick

00:20:52.414 --> 00:20:55.650
around for Raphael's lessons in
astronomy.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.243
She'd just as soon learn it,
she told us,

00:20:58.243 --> 00:20:59.799
[laughs]
later from Adam,

00:20:59.799 --> 00:21:03.559
whose pedagogy was a little
more interesting than Raphael's

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:07.190
because Adam interspersed his
lessons with kisses.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:10.091
That was Eve's choice,
and Milton goes out of his way

00:21:10.091 --> 00:21:12.099
to represent that as Eve's
choice;

00:21:12.099 --> 00:21:15.730
but after the Fall,
Eve is not given that choice.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.646
She's forced to absent herself
here and Adam,

00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:24.630
who gets to stay -- it's not
clear what kind of privilege

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:29.971
that is -- is subjected to the
severity of Michael's teaching

00:21:29.971 --> 00:21:34.866
on some level because he can't
be trusted to behave as a

00:21:34.866 --> 00:21:37.846
rational,
self-governing individual after

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:40.376
the Fall.
Someone is going to have to

00:21:40.376 --> 00:21:44.259
teach him, and in fact teach him
quite forcefully,

00:21:44.259 --> 00:21:50.275
how to understand life in the
fallen world.So Michael

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:56.289
enters onto the scene and -- I
think this is his goal,

00:21:56.289 --> 00:22:00.500
at least -- to instill in Adam
the powers of reason and virtue.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.072
He does this by means of a
history lesson,

00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:06.774
something that before the Fall,
Adam seems to have possessed

00:22:06.774 --> 00:22:10.385
instinctively -- or rather,
it was a kind of reason and

00:22:10.385 --> 00:22:12.729
virtue that he possessed
instinctively,

00:22:12.729 --> 00:22:14.950
but now it needs to be
instilled.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.402
Michael presents Adam with the
sweep of Christian history and

00:22:18.402 --> 00:22:21.452
with the promise of man's
eventual redemption from the

00:22:21.452 --> 00:22:24.664
Fall,
and it's this entire lesson

00:22:24.664 --> 00:22:30.552
that Adam is going to have to
internalize, literally take in

00:22:30.552 --> 00:22:33.203
to himself.
The last two books of

00:22:33.203 --> 00:22:35.948
Paradise Lost,
I think in a lot of ways,

00:22:35.948 --> 00:22:39.230
represent something like a
drama of internalization.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:43.163
One of the important aspects of
these books is what they have to

00:22:43.163 --> 00:22:45.979
tell us, I think,
about the complicated

00:22:45.979 --> 00:22:50.480
psychological process of the
internalization of any kind of

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:54.981
authoritative wisdom.So
we're finally now in a position

00:22:54.981 --> 00:23:00.400
actually to look at the poem.
Look at page 442 in the

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:05.960
Hughes. This is Book
Eleven, line 411.

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.375
Michael's history lesson is
really quite extraordinarily,

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:14.075
carefully organized.
It's broken up into two

00:23:14.075 --> 00:23:17.663
discrete sections,
books Eleven and Twelve,

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:22.960
and these two discrete sections
proceed along entirely distinct

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.398
lines.
The first half of the lesson,

00:23:25.398 --> 00:23:28.394
which takes us up to the moment
of God's destruction of the

00:23:28.394 --> 00:23:32.660
world with Noah's flood,
is presented to Adam as a

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:39.089
vision, and Adam sees this early
history unfold itself.

00:23:39.089 --> 00:23:43.200
This is something that comes to
him through the access of his

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.497
eyes.
The second half of the lesson,

00:23:45.497 --> 00:23:48.829
which is the entirety of the
lesson as it exists in Book

00:23:48.829 --> 00:23:51.980
Twelve, is not presented to Adam
visually at all.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.460
Michael simply describes it to
Adam.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.823
He relates it in the form of a
narrative.This shift from

00:23:59.823 --> 00:24:02.559
vision to narrative has
everything,

00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:05.632
I think, to do with the
psychological process of

00:24:05.632 --> 00:24:09.619
internalization that Milton is
exploring in the last books.

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:13.015
I think it has everything to do
as well with the shift in

00:24:13.015 --> 00:24:16.774
literary style to which Milton
subjects the ending of his great

00:24:16.774 --> 00:24:19.565
epic.
The turn to the new style of

00:24:19.565 --> 00:24:23.975
books Eleven and Twelve is in a
lot of ways analogous to

00:24:23.975 --> 00:24:28.465
Michael's turn to didactic
narrative in Book Twelve after

00:24:28.465 --> 00:24:32.260
the grand tableaus,
after all of the visual

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:37.302
splendor that he has conjured in
the visions -- the masques the

00:24:37.302 --> 00:24:41.206
tableau vivant
essentially -- that Michael

00:24:41.206 --> 00:24:45.752
presents to Adam in Book XI.
This new style is geared even

00:24:45.752 --> 00:24:49.220
more intensely toward the
project of internalization.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.356
It places a greater and greater
burden on Adam and certainly on

00:24:54.356 --> 00:24:59.410
the reader to ascertain its
significance.Traditionally,

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.619
the truths of history could
actually be seen,

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:03.677
but eventually,
by the time we get to Book

00:25:03.677 --> 00:25:05.839
Twelve,
they can only be heard.

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:11.950
Adam has to become increasingly
active in his own education.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:21.450
So let's look first at the
visionary aspect of Book Eleven.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.700
I don't know what to do with
this passage.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.356
This is line 411:
Michael leads Adam to the top

00:25:26.356 --> 00:25:30.597
of the highest hill in paradise,
a hill so high -- explain this

00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:35.229
to me -- that Adam can see the
location of every great Western

00:25:35.229 --> 00:25:39.710
city that will come to establish
itself in future years,

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.869
but simply seeing all of these
locations isn't sufficient.

00:25:43.869 --> 00:25:47.098
Michael's pedagogy has to be
more thoroughgoing even than

00:25:47.098 --> 00:25:50.788
that, and so he inspires Adam to
see the actual scenes of history

00:25:50.788 --> 00:25:52.980
unfold themselves before his
eyes.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.960
This is what we're told at line
411:

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.779
…
[B]ut to nobler sights

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:01.970
Michael from Adam's eyes the
Film remov'd

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.510
Which that false Fruit that
promis'd clearer sight

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:09.786
Had bred;
then purg'd [Michael having

00:26:09.786 --> 00:26:11.950
purged Adam's eyes]
with

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.613
Euphrasy and Rue
The visual Nerve,

00:26:14.613 --> 00:26:18.424
for he had much to see;
And from the Well of Life three

00:26:18.424 --> 00:26:20.913
drops instill'd.
So deep the power of these

00:26:20.913 --> 00:26:24.317
Ingredients pierc'd,
Ev'n to the inmost seat of

00:26:24.317 --> 00:26:27.601
mental sight,
That Adam now enforc't to close

00:26:27.601 --> 00:26:31.066
his eyes,
Sunk down and all his Spirits

00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:35.693
became intranst…
There's something about the

00:26:35.693 --> 00:26:39.439
ophthalmological specificity
about this passage that really

00:26:39.439 --> 00:26:42.262
gets me.
This account of what Milton is

00:26:42.262 --> 00:26:46.488
telling us was actually done to
Adam's eyes in order to allow

00:26:46.488 --> 00:26:49.940
him to see the unfolding of
Christian history.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:54.320
The ingestion of the forbidden
fruit seems to have weakened his

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.277
eyesight, and so the new film
that has come to cover over

00:26:58.277 --> 00:27:01.810
Adam's eyes has to be purged
with these herbs,

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:05.441
Euphrasy and Rue.
Michael goes even further than

00:27:05.441 --> 00:27:09.097
that and adds for good measure
three drops from the well of

00:27:09.097 --> 00:27:12.816
life in order to permit Adam to
see in his mind's eye sights

00:27:12.816 --> 00:27:15.842
impossible even before the
Fall.This scene of

00:27:15.842 --> 00:27:18.806
inspiration,
I think, is strange,

00:27:18.806 --> 00:27:22.781
but of course it has a powerful
charge for us,

00:27:22.781 --> 00:27:28.168
not least because for so much
of the poem the poet himself has

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:33.380
claimed to be inspired in his
composition of the poem,

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:37.103
and we know this:
Milton was blind and he was

00:27:37.103 --> 00:27:42.011
convinced that something -- or
at least this is the William

00:27:42.011 --> 00:27:46.749
Kerrigan argument that I
exfoliated for you all -- he was

00:27:46.749 --> 00:27:52.165
convinced that something that he
had eaten had on some level been

00:27:52.165 --> 00:27:57.242
responsible for the vaporous
film that seemed to have covered

00:27:57.242 --> 00:28:00.800
his eyes.
In the invocation to Book

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.326
Three, you'll remember Milton
bids the muse Urania to purge

00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:08.915
him of that film:
"all mist from thence / purge

00:28:08.915 --> 00:28:12.208
and disperse,
that I may see and tell / of

00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:14.569
things invisible to mortal
sight."

00:28:14.569 --> 00:28:17.473
Milton's clearly drawing a
connection here between his own

00:28:17.473 --> 00:28:20.681
inspiration to write Paradise
Lost and Adam's preparation

00:28:20.681 --> 00:28:22.973
to witness the vision that is
future Christian

00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:25.276
history.That much,
I think, is clear,

00:28:25.276 --> 00:28:27.420
but what exactly does this
connection mean?

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:33.204
What is the relation between
Michael's vision in Book XI and

00:28:33.204 --> 00:28:38.890
the inspired epic poem that
Urania -- the heavenly muse,

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:41.812
the heavenly spirit,
or whatever we're supposed to

00:28:41.812 --> 00:28:45.450
call that entity -- that this
entity helps Milton to write?

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:50.763
I welcome other possibilities,
but I think the relation seems

00:28:50.763 --> 00:28:54.039
to be something like an ironic
one,

00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:58.194
and that irony is suggested,
I think, by the weird chemical

00:28:58.194 --> 00:29:01.274
exactitude of Milton's
description of Adam's

00:29:01.274 --> 00:29:04.574
inspiration.
We have an actual scene of

00:29:04.574 --> 00:29:09.215
medically induced inspiration at
the very moment that the

00:29:09.215 --> 00:29:13.939
inspiration of the poem itself
seems to have been lost and

00:29:13.939 --> 00:29:17.896
comes to a stop,
the loss of innocence that has

00:29:17.896 --> 00:29:22.106
brought with it the loss of
Milton's -- or what I think we

00:29:22.106 --> 00:29:25.873
were associating with and
identifying as Milton's --

00:29:25.873 --> 00:29:30.380
inspired poetry.Milton
carefully crafts his account,

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:36.055
I think, of this vision of
poetry in a poetic style that

00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:42.039
can only with great difficulty
be described as inspired.

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:45.646
It's these last two books are
amazing works of art,

00:29:45.646 --> 00:29:49.974
but we don't have anything like
that extravagant and dramatic

00:29:49.974 --> 00:29:54.374
rhetorical lushness that had so
characterized the previous ten

00:29:54.374 --> 00:29:57.998
books.
What you have in Book Eleven is

00:29:57.998 --> 00:30:00.757
Milton's enactment,
in some way,

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:05.829
of the birth of what we can
think of as modern poetry,

00:30:05.829 --> 00:30:11.820
a poetry that's been purged of
excess and purged of all of that

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.800
open-ended figuration.
Think of the Renaissance and

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.349
the literature of Spenser and
Shakespeare.

00:30:18.349 --> 00:30:24.486
The Renaissance called the
amplitude of its great writers

00:30:24.486 --> 00:30:28.390
copia.
We no longer have that copia

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:33.322
here in the last two books.
We have a poetics that is given

00:30:33.322 --> 00:30:38.579
to Puritan austerity and simple
declarations of moral facts,

00:30:38.579 --> 00:30:41.517
and you will see that the
poetic mode of Paradise

00:30:41.517 --> 00:30:43.130
Regained and,
in fact,

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:47.478
the poetic mode of a lot of
later poets -- I'm thinking of

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:51.902
the discursive poetry of a
Romantic poet like Wordsworth --

00:30:51.902 --> 00:30:55.793
has been heavily influenced by
the last two books of

00:30:55.793 --> 00:31:00.599
Paradise Lost.So Adam
has to be chemically induced to

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:05.176
see future Christian history
because all other inspiration in

00:31:05.176 --> 00:31:10.370
the poem is no longer operative.
Adam has to be compelled,

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.432
literally compelled,
to see how this history unfolds

00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:19.210
itself in the manner of little
pageants and little skits.

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:23.045
He has to see it,
of course, because he's not

00:31:23.045 --> 00:31:27.751
able at this stage in his
development to understand its

00:31:27.751 --> 00:31:32.720
import through the non-visual
faculty of imagination.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.869
I think Milton,
the inspired prophet,

00:31:35.869 --> 00:31:40.505
has an incredibly and
troublingly complicated relation

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:45.520
to Adam at this point -- Adam,
who is so uninspired in this

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.966
poem that Milton has claimed to
be so overly inspired to write

00:31:49.966 --> 00:31:53.296
in the first place.
My guess is that the blind

00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:56.018
poet, Milton,
is actually scornful on some

00:31:56.018 --> 00:32:00.201
level of the fact that Adam has
to be inspired merely to see the

00:32:00.201 --> 00:32:04.121
events of future years.
Milton's own prophetic powers

00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:08.173
presumably entirely transcended
the entire category of the

00:32:08.173 --> 00:32:10.589
visual.Okay,
let's move on.

00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:13.859
Look at the top of page 446 in
the Hughes.

00:32:13.859 --> 00:32:17.789
This is Book Eleven,
line 556.

00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:20.967
This is Milton's description
[laughs]

00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:24.849
of the cities of the plain that
Adam sees,

00:32:24.849 --> 00:32:29.094
and the emphasis is everywhere
in this account on those things

00:32:29.094 --> 00:32:33.130
that can be discerned through
acts of visual perception.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.688
So line 556: 
He look'd and saw a

00:32:37.688 --> 00:32:39.550
spacious Plain,
whereon

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:42.750
Were Tents of various hue;
by some were herds

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.930
Of Cattel grazing:
others, whence the sound

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.099
Of Instruments that made
melodious chime

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:51.829
Was heard, of Harp and
Organ…

00:32:51.829 --> 00:32:54.236
And here Milton goes on to
describe the player of that

00:32:54.236 --> 00:32:56.154
organ;
this is the first human

00:32:56.154 --> 00:32:59.967
musician.
Presumably, this is the first

00:32:59.967 --> 00:33:05.510
human artist of any kind.
He hears the chime but also: 

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:08.516
[W]ho mov'd
Thir stops and chords was seen:

00:33:08.516 --> 00:33:10.967
his volant touch
Instinct through all

00:33:10.967 --> 00:33:15.191
proportions low and high
Fled and pursu'd transverse the

00:33:15.191 --> 00:33:19.317
resonant fugue.
Now we might reasonably expect

00:33:19.317 --> 00:33:22.950
that Milton's one and only
representation of a human

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:26.688
musician in the poem,
a figure whose artistic touch

00:33:26.688 --> 00:33:29.765
is a lot like Milton's,
"instinct through all

00:33:29.765 --> 00:33:33.892
proportions low and high" -- we
might expect that this would

00:33:33.892 --> 00:33:38.369
appear in a favorable context.
Why would we not?

00:33:38.369 --> 00:33:41.347
But, as in so many [laughs]
other instances throughout

00:33:41.347 --> 00:33:42.920
these final books,
Milton,

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.451
who has so absolutely become
our stereotype of him as the

00:33:47.451 --> 00:33:51.393
humorless Puritan,
is turning on -- he's really

00:33:51.393 --> 00:33:56.205
betraying the very art of sound
that constitutes one of his

00:33:56.205 --> 00:34:00.563
poem's greatest achievements.
There has to be something

00:34:00.563 --> 00:34:03.698
self-wounding here in this
derogation of music,

00:34:03.698 --> 00:34:07.720
and I don't care that it's
fallen music.Nonetheless,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.013
this is beautiful music that
Milton knows that he's

00:34:11.013 --> 00:34:14.175
representing here,
but the beautiful music of the

00:34:14.175 --> 00:34:17.929
organ is nonetheless
inextricably linked to the Fall.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:22.166
The organist's fingers flee and
pursue the resonant fugue just

00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:25.500
as Adam and Eve will soon be
fleeing paradise,

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:31.409
pursued, of course,
by a band of armed cherubim.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:36.219
Like the beautiful sounds that
are heard, beautiful sights that

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:40.254
are seen are necessarily
unvaryingly suspect in these

00:34:40.254 --> 00:34:42.655
books.
It's really not until books

00:34:42.655 --> 00:34:46.269
Eleven and Twelve that we get
the full sense of just how much

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:48.497
[laughs]
of a surly Puritan Milton has

00:34:48.497 --> 00:34:50.619
become,
just how much of the

00:34:50.619 --> 00:34:53.559
suspiciousness,
the general suspiciousness,

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:57.550
that the Puritans had of the
whole aesthetic category,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.410
how much of that he has adopted
for himself.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.620
Look down at line 580.
These men on the cities of the

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.887
plain:
Long had not walkt,

00:35:07.887 --> 00:35:11.440
when from the Tents behold
A Beavy of fair Women,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.620
richly gay
In Gems and wanton dress;

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.456
to the Harp they sung
Soft amorous Ditties,

00:35:17.456 --> 00:35:21.625
and in dance [laughs]
I love this phrase and I don't

00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:26.937
really know if it
meant then what it means now]

00:35:26.937 --> 00:35:32.010
came on [isn't that
wonderful?]:

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:36.659
The Men though grave,
ey'd them, and let thir eyes

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:40.539
Rove without rein,
till in the amorous Net

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:44.860
Fast caught,
they lik'd, and each his liking

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.519
chose…
So the faculties of perception

00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:51.309
here are nothing more than the
vehicles of deception.

00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:54.717
They're implicated in this
endless replaying of the sexual

00:35:54.717 --> 00:35:58.630
seduction that is now viewed,
mistakenly of course,

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.869
as the cause of the
Fall.Well,

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:07.168
dopey Adam here is still at an
early stage in Michael's

00:36:07.168 --> 00:36:12.599
achingly long lesson in history.
Of course, Adam thinks that

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:16.598
things with his descendants are
starting to look pretty good,

00:36:16.598 --> 00:36:20.730
and so that's what he tells
Michael at the top of page 447.

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:25.043
This is line 598:
"True opener of mine eyes,

00:36:25.043 --> 00:36:29.256
prime Angel blest,
/ Much better seems this

00:36:29.256 --> 00:36:32.531
Vision,
and more hope / Of peaceful

00:36:32.531 --> 00:36:36.150
dayes portends,
then those two past…"

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:40.378
As so often -- and this is a
pattern that will repeat itself

00:36:40.378 --> 00:36:44.750
until the book is done -- Adam
has completely missed the point

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.273
of Michael's lesson.
He mistakes the pleasant

00:36:48.273 --> 00:36:52.329
appearance of this scene with
moral rectitude itself,

00:36:52.329 --> 00:36:55.889
and so when Adam tells Michael,
"Much better seems this

00:36:55.889 --> 00:36:59.712
Vision," he's really no better
than the men who live on the

00:36:59.712 --> 00:37:03.601
plain who are eying the bevy of
fair women and letting their

00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:07.489
eyes rove without rein.It's
the fact that this beauty is

00:37:07.489 --> 00:37:10.389
apprehended solely through the
eyes,

00:37:10.389 --> 00:37:13.506
solely through the senses,
that, of course,

00:37:13.506 --> 00:37:16.400
lies at the heart of the danger
here.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.201
Adam has to learn to exercise
his reason, and this is one of

00:37:21.201 --> 00:37:25.840
the things that Michael gets him
to perform eventually.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.758
All things beautiful are by
definition here suspect,

00:37:28.758 --> 00:37:31.389
and this is one of the lessons
derived from,

00:37:31.389 --> 00:37:36.249
I think, the most elaborate of
all of the classes that Michael

00:37:36.249 --> 00:37:40.950
offers Adam -- and that's the
history of the great flood.

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:45.349
Look at page 452.
This is line 826.

00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:48.397
This story is so important that
it's one that's actually

00:37:48.397 --> 00:37:52.113
narrated twice.
We have first the narrator's

00:37:52.113 --> 00:37:57.859
description of the prophetic
reenactment of the flood -- or

00:37:57.859 --> 00:37:59.856
rather,
it's not a reenactment,

00:37:59.856 --> 00:38:02.570
it's a pre-enactment because it
actually hasn't happened yet.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:05.909
This is the version that Adam
actually sees.

00:38:05.909 --> 00:38:09.010
Then second,
we have Michael's long,

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:14.324
play-by-play accounting to Adam
of what it is exactly that he

00:38:14.324 --> 00:38:18.309
has just seen at line 826 of
Book Eleven.

00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:21.820
This is the narrated section of
the story of the flood.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:26.939
Michael is describing for Adam
the terrible rain that will undo

00:38:26.939 --> 00:38:30.489
all of the work of the earth's
creation:

00:38:30.489 --> 00:38:31.949
…
[A]ll fountains of the Deep

00:38:31.949 --> 00:38:34.909
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean
to usurp

00:38:34.909 --> 00:38:38.130
Beyond all bounds,
till inundation rise

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:41.679
Above the highest Hills:
then shall this Mount

00:38:41.679 --> 00:38:45.110
Of Paradise by might of Waves
be mov'd

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.300
Out of his place,
push'd by the horned flood,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:52.260
With all his verdure spoil'd,
and Trees adrift

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.480
Down the great River to the
op'ning Gulf,

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:04.519
And there take root an Island
salt and bare

00:39:04.519 --> 00:39:11.355
[This line:]
The haunt of Seals and Orcs,

00:39:11.355 --> 00:39:17.912
and Sea-mews' clang.
Michael's describing the effect

00:39:17.912 --> 00:39:21.582
of the flood on Eden.
This is the mount of paradise,

00:39:21.582 --> 00:39:26.326
which, like all other things,
will be moved out of its place

00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:30.426
by the flood and washed into the
opening gulf of the

00:39:30.426 --> 00:39:35.331
ocean.Now this particular
image teaches us a lot more than

00:39:35.331 --> 00:39:39.030
simply the extent of this mighty
flood.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:44.376
The point here is the ultimate
insignificance of all tangible

00:39:44.376 --> 00:39:49.989
things, of anything whose beauty
we had been appreciating by our

00:39:49.989 --> 00:39:53.268
senses.
Adam has been permitted by an

00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:58.262
extraordinary administration of
magic eyedrops to see a scene of

00:39:58.262 --> 00:40:01.750
future history whose point is
the vanity,

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:06.364
the emptiness,
of all those things that can be

00:40:06.364 --> 00:40:11.389
seen, and the lesson is
absolutely devastating.

00:40:11.389 --> 00:40:14.906
The garden of paradise -- whose
lush vegetation,

00:40:14.906 --> 00:40:19.245
whose wandering rivers we have
had described for us in such

00:40:19.245 --> 00:40:23.809
powerfully visual terms and in
such powerfully seductive verse

00:40:23.809 --> 00:40:28.148
-- this garden will one day be
pulled into the sea where it

00:40:28.148 --> 00:40:31.739
will "take root an Island salt
and bare,

00:40:31.739 --> 00:40:36.520
/ the haunt of Seals and Orcs,
and Sea-mews' clang."The

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:41.713
effect here is not simply on our
visual memory of the vegetative

00:40:41.713 --> 00:40:46.740
splendor of Milton's paradise:
Milton's assaulting as well our

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:50.449
aural memory of the sounds of
paradise,

00:40:50.449 --> 00:40:55.039
our memory of the beauty of the
poetic verse that had produced

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:59.402
in us our visual sense of the
gorgeousness of the Garden of

00:40:59.402 --> 00:41:02.092
Eden.
In the repressive Puritan

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:06.923
regime of the last two books,
the resonant organ tones of the

00:41:06.923 --> 00:41:11.110
poem's earlier books also have
to be washed away.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:20.654
So in that amazing line,
"the haunt of Seals and Orcs,

00:41:20.654 --> 00:41:31.640
and Sea-mews' clang," Milton
creates an onomatopoetic line.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.154
What does it do?
It actually enacts with a kind

00:41:35.154 --> 00:41:39.513
of strident horror the
squawking, horrible sounds of

00:41:39.513 --> 00:41:44.447
these sea creatures.
It offers us a sonic emblem of

00:41:44.447 --> 00:41:49.195
the general stridency,
I think, of the concluding

00:41:49.195 --> 00:41:55.032
books: the uncompromising tone
of severity that instructs us

00:41:55.032 --> 00:42:01.263
not to overvalue the lush beauty
of the previous books -- not to

00:42:01.263 --> 00:42:07.298
overvalue the beauty of paradise
but also not to overvalue the

00:42:07.298 --> 00:42:13.530
beauty of the poetry of
Paradise Lost.Well,

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:20.027
a question presents itself at
this point and it's one that I

00:42:20.027 --> 00:42:24.594
think is inescapable.
Why does Eden have to be

00:42:24.594 --> 00:42:28.082
destroyed at all?
"Why is it washed away in

00:42:28.082 --> 00:42:33.469
Noah's flood?"
we ask.

00:42:33.469 --> 00:42:36.397
The paradise that was lost,
it turns out,

00:42:36.397 --> 00:42:40.668
wasn't the significant one.
This is an incredibly important

00:42:40.668 --> 00:42:45.599
part of Michael's lesson.
Look at how Michael explains

00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:50.741
this at line 836:
paradise is destroyed -- he's

00:42:50.741 --> 00:42:55.100
talking to Adam:
"To teach thee that God

00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:59.460
attributes to place / no
sanctity,

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.977
if none be thither brought / by
Men who there frequent,

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:07.636
or therein dwell."
Now think of what Michael has

00:43:07.636 --> 00:43:10.143
just said.
The Garden of Eden will become

00:43:10.143 --> 00:43:13.651
an "Island salt and bare" at
least a thousand years after the

00:43:13.651 --> 00:43:17.510
moment that Michael is currently
related this prophecy to Adam.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:22.935
Eden will be destroyed in order
to teach Adam at this very

00:43:22.935 --> 00:43:28.170
moment in the present time that
places aren't divine,

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:31.522
only the people that live in
them.This is an

00:43:31.522 --> 00:43:36.159
extraordinarily bizarre temporal
disjunction that we have here.

00:43:36.159 --> 00:43:40.260
Paradise isn't going to be
destroyed for another millennium

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:45.087
or so in the time of Noah,
but it will be destroyed in

00:43:45.087 --> 00:43:51.519
order to make good on Michael's
prophecy of its destruction.

00:43:51.519 --> 00:43:55.635
Paradise has to be destroyed so
that Michael's prophecy of that

00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:59.285
event can have its proper
pedagogical effect on Adam now

00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:02.139
in the present moment of the
narration.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:06.487
Michael attempts -- it's an
amazing way to compel the

00:44:06.487 --> 00:44:11.337
internalization of paradise by
forcing Adam to confront its

00:44:11.337 --> 00:44:15.455
real-life destruction.Now,
at the conclusion of these

00:44:15.455 --> 00:44:18.349
lessons in history -- this is
near the end of Book Twelve,

00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:23.655
page 467, line 585 -- Michael
states in much more formal terms

00:44:23.655 --> 00:44:26.960
just this lesson of
internalization.

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.650
So, "having listened to my
history," Michael tells Adam:

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.340
"hen wilt thou not be loath /
To leave this Paradise,

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.159
but shalt possess / A Paradise
within thee, happier far."

00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:44.393
Once Adam pictures the terrible
destruction of paradise,

00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:47.685
he'll come to understand that
an internalized paradise is

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:51.456
superior,
and it's a happy compensation

00:44:51.456 --> 00:44:55.569
for the lost place of Eden.
Readers of Milton,

00:44:55.569 --> 00:44:59.196
and certainly scholars of
Milton, have taken Michael at

00:44:59.196 --> 00:45:03.429
his word when he tells Adam that
the paradise that dwells within

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:07.392
will be happier far than the
paradise in which he himself is

00:45:07.392 --> 00:45:10.079
currently dwelling and will
soon,

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:13.403
of course, be forced to
leave.There's an important

00:45:13.403 --> 00:45:16.851
sense in which we have to see
the inward paradise as the

00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:20.300
greater and more consequential
Miltonic phenomenon.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.369
As a radical Protestant,
Milton had always insisted on

00:45:23.369 --> 00:45:26.960
the superiority of inward human
reason and of the inward spirit

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.203
over anything like the visual
splendor of churches or the

00:45:30.203 --> 00:45:33.909
sanctity of so-called holy
places -- or the written codes,

00:45:33.909 --> 00:45:37.670
for that matter,
of church doctrine.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:42.914
From a doctrinal point of view,
there is no question Michael is

00:45:42.914 --> 00:45:47.066
beyond reproach here;
but I still want to apply,

00:45:47.066 --> 00:45:51.733
because this is what I do,
a little bit of skepticism to

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:57.260
this little bit of dogma.
How convincing is Michael here?

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.809
Does our learning in one line
that the paradise within us is

00:46:00.809 --> 00:46:04.480
actually happier far -- does it
really undo our investment,

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:07.219
the readers' investment,
in this place,

00:46:07.219 --> 00:46:11.400
this paradise which has been so
lovingly and so beautifully

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.510
described in the thousands of
lines that preceded it?

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:18.340
When Michael describes the
"Seals and Orcs and Sea-Mews'

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.480
clang" that will literally take
over the place of paradise,

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.232
can we help but look back with
regret at the liberal beauties

00:46:26.232 --> 00:46:30.588
of this poem before this
strident archangel had taken it

00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:35.340
over essentially -- taken the
poem into receivership with his

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.409
unyielding dogmatism?From
the aesthetic point of view,

00:46:40.409 --> 00:46:46.489
I think Michael's discourse is
a complete disaster.

00:46:46.489 --> 00:46:50.544
We experience it as a form of
loss, and Milton compels us as

00:46:50.544 --> 00:46:53.727
readers, I think,
to experience along with Adam

00:46:53.727 --> 00:46:56.639
and Eve something like the loss
of paradise.

00:46:56.639 --> 00:47:01.136
We are compelled to undergo the
loss of what we loved about

00:47:01.136 --> 00:47:04.320
Paradise Lost.
We are compelled to undergo

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.190
the aesthetic fall that is taken
by this very poem.

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:10.195
This is, I think,
Milton's way of precipitating

00:47:10.195 --> 00:47:14.179
our internalization of his
poem.As I mentioned earlier,

00:47:14.179 --> 00:47:18.180
in the late 1650s Milton was no
longer able to justify the

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.619
extension of political liberties
to the people.

00:47:21.619 --> 00:47:23.916
The English people,
to his mind,

00:47:23.916 --> 00:47:28.509
had fallen and Milton could no
longer imagine granting them the

00:47:28.509 --> 00:47:32.065
kind of freedom of
self-determination that he had

00:47:32.065 --> 00:47:35.325
described so rhapsodically in a
treatise like

00:47:35.325 --> 00:47:40.205
Areopagitica.
You can see a related hardening

00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:45.453
of sensibility really in the
last books of Paradise Lost

00:47:45.453 --> 00:47:50.429
in the fallen reader
and the fallen poet.

00:47:50.429 --> 00:47:53.983
We can no longer afford the
moral and theological

00:47:53.983 --> 00:47:58.055
uncertainty that had been
fostered and really celebrated

00:47:58.055 --> 00:48:01.980
by the sublime poetic style that
we can now call,

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:06.695
now that it's gone, Miltonic.
It's as if we can no longer

00:48:06.695 --> 00:48:10.199
afford the indulgence in all of
those stylistic elements of the

00:48:10.199 --> 00:48:13.703
earlier books that have been so
carefully purged from Michael's

00:48:13.703 --> 00:48:17.200
lessons in history.
It's as if we can't afford to

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:20.447
indulge in those ethically
ambiguous similes,

00:48:20.447 --> 00:48:25.170
the delectable allusions to the
full range of pagan classics,

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:28.794
and those extraordinary flights
of the poet's own original

00:48:28.794 --> 00:48:32.292
myth-making -- all of those
elements that have made this

00:48:32.292 --> 00:48:35.090
poem so grand but that have
continually,

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.634
as we've charted,
threatened to unhinge the story

00:48:38.634 --> 00:48:42.990
from anything like its basis in
moral doctrine or scriptural

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:47.495
certainty.The poetic effect
that we have here is primarily

00:48:47.495 --> 00:48:51.704
one of loss and it's a type of
loss that we've encountered

00:48:51.704 --> 00:48:55.167
before in Milton.
I'm just about at my

00:48:55.167 --> 00:48:59.939
conclusion, but I want to remind
you of Milton's first poem,

00:48:59.939 --> 00:49:03.741
his first great poem,
the Nativity Ode of

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:05.983
1629.
Milton, you'll remember,

00:49:05.983 --> 00:49:08.730
had described the triumphant
entry of Christ.

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:13.386
His destruction of all of the
evil pagan gods and the onset of

00:49:13.386 --> 00:49:17.280
the Christian era was celebrated
as a joyous one;

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.990
but of course it brought with
it a loss that Milton at that

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:24.346
time was willing to measure.
The pagan nymphs,

00:49:24.346 --> 00:49:27.557
you'll remember,
felt the pain of their

00:49:27.557 --> 00:49:32.712
banishment from the beautiful
forests of classical literature:

00:49:32.712 --> 00:49:37.529
"With flower-inwov'n tresses
torn / the Nimphs in twilight

00:49:37.529 --> 00:49:40.909
shade of tangled thickets
mourn."

00:49:40.909 --> 00:49:44.385
That poem of religious
celebration made a brief,

00:49:44.385 --> 00:49:47.269
but it was potent,
detour into elegy,

00:49:47.269 --> 00:49:51.164
and Milton seemed almost to
recognize the painfulness of the

00:49:51.164 --> 00:49:55.190
loss of classical literature and
the loss of the poetic beauty

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.821
with which we associate
classical literature.I think

00:49:58.821 --> 00:50:02.583
there's a related sense of loss
that attends the otherwise

00:50:02.583 --> 00:50:06.081
triumphant conclusion of the
theological doctrine that

00:50:06.081 --> 00:50:09.579
Michael presents at the end of
Book Twelve.

00:50:09.579 --> 00:50:13.622
On the doctrinal level,
Michael does end on a painfully

00:50:13.622 --> 00:50:18.337
optimistic note -- I know that's
an oxymoron but it still brings

00:50:18.337 --> 00:50:22.903
me pain -- the way in which he
represents the promise of man's

00:50:22.903 --> 00:50:26.676
eventual redemption.
But on an aesthetic level,

00:50:26.676 --> 00:50:30.611
you have almost the plangency,
I think, of elegy -- a sad

00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:34.476
consciousness of all of those
pleasures and all of those

00:50:34.476 --> 00:50:38.199
liberties that now have to be
forsaken.Okay.

00:50:38.199 --> 00:50:42.101
I'm ending the lecture there,
but I just want to remind you

00:50:42.101 --> 00:50:45.599
that that, of course,
is not the end of the story.

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:48.550
The poem will change a final
time.

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.510
Once again, in its last hundred
lines or so you will have the

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:56.670
reemergence of a lot of things
that we associate with Milton.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:00.514
Certainly we'll have the
reemergence of the epic simile,

00:51:00.514 --> 00:51:04.150
which we'll pay attention to
closely on Wednesday.

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:09.000
So focus for the next class on
the poem's ending.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.833
(mysterious electronic music)

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.890
- Okay everyone, greetings.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.450
Nice to see you all.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.400
Welcome to the fourth lecture.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.400
As you'll remember,
section starts this week.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.630
Somewhat incredibly we
have a Pole, a Ukrainian,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.600
and a Lithuanian TF-ing in this class,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.780
which honestly could not have been,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.130
I mean, if I'd tried to do that,

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.720
there's no way that could
have actually happened.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.740
So your TFs will be the
beautiful and talented,

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.173
Zhenia Monastyrskyi.

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:44.010
Zhenia, say hello.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.030
There you go, that's Zhenia.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.650
- [Zhenia] We already met.
- Oh, okay.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.413
The equally beautiful and
talented Wiktor Babinski,

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.859
and the no less beautiful
and talented Maksimas Milta.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:56.040
These are your three TFs.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.510
Get to know them, get to love them,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.370
figure out what the bribery culture is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.210
in their various countries,
and adapt yourself to it.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.954
Lots of laughter from the
Ukrainians there, that's a clue.

00:01:05.954 --> 00:01:08.580
(audience laughing)

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.413
That's a clue.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.780
I do not have time for
funny bribery stories.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.830
If there's time at the end of the lecture,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.150
I'll tell you a funny bribery story.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.660
Okay, so welcome.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.720
We are working our way now
towards proper history.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.850
I've been trying to set
up some of the concepts

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.070
because the longer I've
been doing this job,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.470
the more it seems to me
that we have to think about

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
what history is before we
jump into doing the subject.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.830
And so I've been using the fact

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.050
that we're in the moment
in the middle of a war

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.540
to try to help the, I've
been trying to use the war

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.400
to like shake up the concepts

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.980
and to help us think about
how things are fluid,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.510
and also help us to think about

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.760
how we talk and how we think about things

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.930
may influence the world
more than we realize, right?

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.000
That the unthinking or half thinking ways

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.590
that we approach the past

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.020
will affect the decisions
that we make in the future

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280
by determining how we see
things in the present.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.780
But this is also really important,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.750
because Ukraine is, you
know, for many of you,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.583
a new subject.

00:02:07.583 --> 00:02:09.660
And even for those of you
who it's not a new subject,

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.940
it's unlikely that you've
actually had a class

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.440
that was just about Ukrainian history.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.030
Did anybody check how many classes

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.580
in Ukrainian history there are?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.860
- [Student] I couldn't find any.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.610
- Okay, so I'm holding one lecture class

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.670
in the United States of
America on modern Ukraine,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.560
which is an extraordinary thing, right?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.700
If you think about it.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.310
It raises the question of
what has gone wrong with us

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.750
in general, right?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.380
Like, no, why is it that what we do

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.590
is so mismatched with the
world around us, right?

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.000
Like don't you feel ill served?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.380
If you're going to any, I mean,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.140
okay, not everybody at
Yale is in this class,

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.090
but isn't it odd to
think that if you were at

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.800
any other university in the United States,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.182
you wouldn't even be able
to take a class in Ukraine,

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:53.880
even though, right?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.890
And that raises the larger question of

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.410
why is it, in the 21st century,

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.210
where we supposedly have
access to all this data

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.120
all the time, and we all
know everything instantly,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.970
why are we always
surprised by things, right?

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.240
Why is it that things
that happen in the world

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.490
always seem to catch us unprepared?

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.870
And so you know what my
answer for that is gonna be,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:13.770
my answer for that is gonna be

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.570
that you should all be history majors.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.980
Because if you're a history
major, or just take,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.150
I don't care whether
you're a major or not,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.130
just take a bunch of history classes,

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.620
because you'll be less
likely to be surprised

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.613
by the things that happen to you

00:03:23.613 --> 00:03:24.870
over the course of your life.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.220
Like, if nothing else, it'll
help you not be surprised

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.720
by stuff that happens.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.010
Okay, our job today is to set up Europe.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.330
You know, if you're looking at it from

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.010
the point of view of today
you could be thinking, well,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.440
is Ukraine Europe, is Europe Ukraine.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.850
We're not there yet.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.430
We're thinking about
the world before Europe,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.680
because Ukraine, Kyivan Rus,

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.480
which we're gonna get
to in the next lecture,

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.820
Kyivan Rus is coming into being at a time

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.920
when the notion of Europe
doesn't really exist yet,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.920
and wouldn't really make any sense.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.240
So I'm gonna start by talking

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.770
about a couple of ways that people look at

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.870
the sequence of events that led to Europe.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.250
Then I'm gonna move on to the things

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.110
which really were there before Europe.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.790
I'm gonna talk about language for a bit,

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.060
I'm gonna talk about
pre-Christian religion for a bit,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.910
and then I'm going to
move towards the story

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.860
of how this state came into being.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.600
So there are, if you are
in, broadly speaking,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.570
the trajectory of Western Europe,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.970
the United States, or North America,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.970
the way that the trajectory
of European history is taught

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.850
begins with ancient Greece.

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.710
And I'm not gonna change that here.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.830
We're also gonna be talking
about ancient Greece.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.323
I'm just gonna be messing
with it a little bit.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.650
I did the whole thing with the olive tree

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.084
and the trident already, right?

00:04:48.084 --> 00:04:50.100
Did I do that in an earlier
lecture? No, I didn't do that?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.933
Okay.

00:04:50.933 --> 00:04:52.350
So I did or I didn't?

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.810
You're the only one
who remembers it, okay.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.880
Maybe the entire class has
switched out since then,

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.713
and you're the only,

00:04:57.713 --> 00:04:59.310
like this was a really
aggressive shopping period,

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.143
they're all new.

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:05.143
Okay, so just to remind
you, of Athens itself,

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.860
the founding story of Athens itself,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.410
involves an olive tree and a trident.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.970
It involves a contest between
Athena, the goddess Athena,

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.580
and Poseidon, who gets to be the namesake.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.470
You know the answer because
the city is not called,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.050
you know, Poseidon, it's called Athens.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.080
So Athena wins because
she gives the Athenians

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.670
an olive tree, and the Athenians say

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.090
this is very nice,
shade, olive oil, right?

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.280
Poseidon strikes his
trident on the ground,

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.190
and seawater springs
forward, springs forth.

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.960
And the Athenians say that
doesn't taste very good,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.860
we're not really into that.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.810
That's the way the story goes, right?

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.370
That's the way the story goes.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.860
And it brings you an image of Athens

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.720
which is peaceful and contemplative

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.790
and maybe tending
towards consumer society.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.840
It's a certain image of democracy, right?

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.160
Whereas Poseidon is offering, you know,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.310
strife, and sea commerce, and war,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.650
and navies, and things like that.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:03.150
Now, underneath that story is a question.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.070
Because, you know, all societies

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.380
in the way that they tell
their story of founding

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.300
are hiding something, right?

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.970
And this little story, what's being hidden

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.470
is the answer to the question:

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.980
how can you possibly live
just on olive oil, right?

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.813
You can't.

00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:22.260
I mean, no, yes?

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.420
I mean, at least you need a little bread

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.770
at least with the olive oil.

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.740
And so where was the bread coming from?

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.360
I'm now gonna see if
anybody was at this lecture.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.710
Where was the bread coming from?

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.770
Where were the calories
actually coming from?

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.603
The grain?

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.760
Yes.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.380
- [Student] The Southern Ukraine, right?

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.889
- Right, what's now Southern Ukraine.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.190
The northern coast.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.410
So the ancient world,
the ancient Greek world,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.823
includes the Black Sea,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.150
up to and including the
north Black Sea coast,

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.710
which is now Southern Ukraine.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.870
That's where the calories came from.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.660
And so you can plant
your little city state

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.070
full of olive trees,

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.970
because you're engaged in
an international trade,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.030
and you're getting your
calories from somewhere else.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.880
So this isn't just mark
that, that's important,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:10.530
because the connection
of our part of the world

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.450
with other parts of the world
by way of food and calories

00:07:15.523 --> 00:07:16.356
is enduring.

00:07:16.356 --> 00:07:17.850
So for the ancient Greeks,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.950
what we're calling Ukraine was a place.

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:22.950
And if you did your reading
of the Serhii Plokhy

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.580
you'll know that for Herodotus,
who was a major source,

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.320
the ancient historian Herodotus,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.120
along with Thucydides the two, you know,

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.673
the two people who found history, as such.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.380
Herodotus maps what we call
Ukraine in a certain way,

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:42.380
correctly, which is sea,
coast, steppe, and forest,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.220
moving from south to north, right?

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.670
Sea, coast, steppe and forest.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:51.510
And the further north you go,
the more exotic it is, right?

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.120
So from the point of view
of that civilization,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.130
northward means more exotic.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:57.660
And so it's in the North

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.620
that a lot of the Greek
mythology is located,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.710
a lot of like the
Elysian Fields are there,

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.680
and the Mountains of Hyperborea are there,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.350
griffins are there, all
kinds of stuff is there.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.850
The Scythians, they locate,

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.970
I didn't write the Scythians,
the Scythians are also there.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.620
The Scythians are, in fact, real.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.580
And they did inhabit what's
now Ukraine at the time

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.100
and they did fantastic work in gold.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.440
So that part, the part about Ukraine

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.540
being rich in gold is not entirely false.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.160
The treasures of the
Scythians still exist,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.460
they're still in museums,
they're being looted in this war.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.740
So there are a lot of ways in which

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.600
what happens in the war
actually reminds us of things

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.100
that were a couple of thousand years ago,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.840
like the Scythians, for example.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.930
There's a museum in
Ukraine which was looted,

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.350
and the Scythian gold work has
now been taken off to Russia.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.350
Okay, so the Greeks are already
looking at the territory

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.130
that we think of as Ukraine,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.310
and they already have a certain
geographical view of it,

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.520
which is south to north. And I
want you to think about this,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.580
because we are, you
know, we are in the West,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.260
and so when we look at
Ukraine we're thinking, okay,

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.700
West Ukraine, East Ukraine.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.740
But from the point of view of our story,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.590
south to north and north to south

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.090
is actually much more important,

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.700
at least for the first
few weeks of this class.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.070
Okay, so if you're looking,

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.580
so taking ancient Greece
as a starting point,

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.850
if you're now looking at
this whole thing from today,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.340
but from a Western point of view,

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.330
there's a certain way that
ancient Greece connects to you,

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.130
and this will be familiar to you probably,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.090
it goes like this:

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.630
there was Greece, and then there was Rome,

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.437
and then Rome fell, right?

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.290
Very dramatic, it fell.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.330
Imagine all the buildings falling, right?

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.403
It's a very dramatic image, Rome fell.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.330
It was overrun by barbarians,
it ceased to exist, right?

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.163
Very dramatic.

00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:57.300
And then nothing happened for a while,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.710
and then there was a Renaissance,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.470
or there were Dark Ages and
then there was a Renaissance,

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.480
and then that Renaissance miraculously,

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.950
the clever Europeans discovered

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.080
all those things that were lost.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.820
They discovered the Greek
stuff, and the Roman stuff,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.010
and they, so I told you before,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:12.930
always be skeptical of
this rebirth metaphor,

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.760
because if you think about
rebirth for one second,

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.320
it's really creepy, right?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.120
I mean, just birth itself, honestly.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.100
Like, I don't know how
many of you have seen one,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.960
but it's a thing.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.450
And then think about
doing it twice with the,

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.810
I mean it's just, so be
suspicious of rebirth metaphors,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.100
including the Renaissance.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.130
So anyway, this is a
Western perspective, right?

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.960
Greece, Rome, Rome falls,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.480
then there's a Renaissance where
everything is rediscovered,

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.790
and then after the
Renaissance comes nations,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.620
and the nations, the French, the Italians,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.640
the British, and so on,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.670
all in some way look back to
ancient Greece to this pattern.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:48.390
If you're in our part of the
world, this looks different.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.880
You can still start with
ancient Greece, as I say.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.700
There's Rome, there's
ancient Greece, there's Rome.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.570
So far, so good.

00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.623
Does Rome fall?

00:10:56.787 --> 00:10:58.320
- [Student] No.
- No, never falls.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.320
Yeah, okay (laughs).

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:06.140
There's like one solid supporter
of Byzantium over here.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.200
I'm glad.
(students laughing)

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.960
That's right, Rome does not fall, right?

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.090
Rome doesn't fall, the
buildings don't all fall,

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.800
the Colosseum doesn't
fall, it's still there,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.450
you can visit it today, trust me.

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:16.590
It doesn't all fall down,

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.840
the barbarians don't all
come rushing in one day

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.070
and have a barbarian party.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.123
That never happens.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.760
Part of the Roman Empire

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.970
slowly falls under the
influence of others.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.130
The capital of Rome moves to the city

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:31.020
which is today known as Istanbul,

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.240
but which for a long time
was known as Constantinople.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.240
And the Roman Empire continues
as Byzantium, as Byzantium.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.280
It continues for another thousand years,

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.960
which let's face it,
even if we're cynical,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.330
is a pretty long time.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.550
And that thing which is
called the Renaissance,

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.120
where the clever Europeans
like rediscover all the things,

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.380
the Renaissance is possible,
you know, in large measure,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.590
because Rome never fell
in the first place,

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:59.423
because there was, there's no,

00:11:59.423 --> 00:12:02.250
I'm not gonna say the
Byzantium preserved everything

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.780
of ancient Greece and
ancient Rome, it didn't,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.910
but it preserved a lot of things,

00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:08.250
like for example the Iliad.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.900
So if you've had like any kind of like,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.850
if you've done, you know, DS here,

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.190
have had any kind of
that sort of education,

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:15.810
the Iliad only exists,

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.150
that's the story of the
Trojan War with Achilles

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.120
and all these figures,
the Iliad only exists

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.790
because people for a
thousand years in Byzantium

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.460
hand copied the thing over,
and over, and over, and over,

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.350
and over, and over, and
over, and over, and over,

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:30.690
and over, and over, and over again, right?

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.990
Until late in the day copies
were transferred to Italy

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.040
right before Byzantium
was overcome, let's say.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.560
And then they were printed
in Italy and translated

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.790
and then it becomes a classic text.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.890
And so therefore, because of Byzantium,

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.770
we have Achilles, we have the
Iliad, we have Homer, right?

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.570
And we can say, oh, we rediscovered it,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.403
isn't that wonderful?

00:12:49.403 --> 00:12:50.910
And we can do that kind
of time travel magic

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.350
where we leap back to ancient Greece.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.390
But it's less time travel magic

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.520
if you remember that
Byzantium was actually around

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.020
for another thousand years.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.740
And for our story, for
our East European story,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.970
you just can't do without
Byzantium in the middle.

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.730
If you're telling this story
from a Western point of view

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.150
it's kind of awkward that
Byzantium is still there, right?

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.140
It's kind of awkward.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.030
It's like you're trying
to like date a new person

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:16.500
but you're still going
out with the other person

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.050
but it's like, I'm not
really, you know, not really,

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:21.927
like you know, she's not, not, you know?

00:13:21.927 --> 00:13:24.180
And that's what Byzantium is
like in the Western story.

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.830
Like okay, there's this
huge thing over there,

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.840
and it calls itself Rome,
and they're speaking Greek,

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.940
but it's not really Europe.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.990
It's not really there.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:32.610
Let's just look the other way, right?

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:33.900
That's what Byzantium is

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.700
if you're doing the West European thing.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:38.490
But if you're not, if you're
trying to figure out Ukraine,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.108
or for that matter Russia or Belarus,

00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:42.060
but the fact that Byzantium

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.770
is there the whole time is important.

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.830
It's not marginal, it's not
some kind of unwanted appendage,

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:48.240
it's not this confusing thing.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.210
It's part of this
unbroken tradition, right?

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.100
So I was just in central Kyiv

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.690
and I was looking at the cathedral,

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:57.330
which is spectacularly
beautiful, St. Sophia,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.170
and it was built, you know,
that was built in 1037, right?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.100
It was built, you know,

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.070
it was built while
Byzantium was still around.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.370
It was built three centuries
before Notre Dame, right?

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:09.870
Three centuries before Notre Dame.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.480
The daughter of the guy who
had it built, by the way,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.620
was Queen of France.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.970
And she went to France and she said

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.320
this place is backward and dirty,

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.240
and I really wanna go home, right?

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.700
So that gives you, and that's
not just the kind of thing

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.080
that makes Ukrainians proud,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.080
but it also just gives you a sense that,

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.830
for quite a while, this Byzantine story

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.256
was a heartier and more interesting story

00:14:31.256 --> 00:14:33.180
than the West European story.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.910
Okay, so there's a different story

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.470
starting with ancient Greece,

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.650
which is, in a way, more
robust and continuous.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.110
I'm not saying it had to be that way.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:44.070
I'm not saying that Ukraine

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.900
had to be part of the Byzantine tradition.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.370
Other things could have happened,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:49.590
but that is in fact how it turned out.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.673
Okay, so language here
then becomes important.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:59.310
In the West European version,
or the Western version,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.883
there's Greek, right, then there's Latin,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.920
and then from Latin you
get the Romance languages,

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:12.900
Portuguese, Romanian,
French, Spanish, Italian.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.650
So the Romance languages
they're called, Rome.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.710
And then you have the Germanic languages.

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:21.780
So the Germanic peoples
were some of the ones

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:25.800
who overwhelmed Rome, replaced
Rome actually kind of slowly.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.783
So, you know, Danish, and Dutch,
and Swedish, German, right?

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.170
So in Western Europe, the
Western Europe is dominated,

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.300
oh English is a Germanic language, forgot.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.870
So Western Europe is
dominated by these Germanic

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.720
and these Romance languages.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.490
In Eastern Europe we have
a different trajectory,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:48.363
which is Greek, more Greek,

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.720
a language called Old Church Slavonic,

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.700
which we'll explain more about

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.870
at the end of this lecture and next week,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.630
and then Slavic languages.

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.060
Now Slavic languages, which
we're gonna move into,

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.660
they are par excellence something
which comes before Europe.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.240
It has always been and is still frankly

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.380
a little mysterious

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.870
why so many people speak
Slavic languages, right?

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.520
The Slavic languages are actually

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.620
the dominant language group of Europe

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.450
if you count the people, right?

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:16.283
If you count the people,

00:16:16.283 --> 00:16:18.600
or especially if you count the territory

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.480
where more people speak
it than any other, right?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.570
Slavic languages cover
a lot more territory

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.900
than Germanic ones do
or than Romance ones do.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.300
And the Slavic languages that were spoken

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:33.600
a thousand years ago are not,

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.570
are clearly related to
the Slavic languages

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:37.560
that are spoken now.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.393
Okay.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.310
Okay, what am I doing with my hand?

00:16:45.697 --> 00:16:48.300
- [Student] Punching.
- Punching, okay.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.280
So if you had a drink, if you had a drink,

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.840
I'm not saying that you did,

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:54.060
but if you had a drink on Saturday night,

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.490
and it was in a big bowl,
had some alcohol in it,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.230
some other stuff, what was that called?

00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:59.063
- [Student] Punch.

00:16:59.063 --> 00:17:00.900
- Okay, why, has it ever occurred to you,

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:04.353
like why is this and the,
why is that the same word?

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.460
That's never occurred to you, okay.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.510
But you know the answer.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.410
- [Student] No, I don't, I just,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.367
if you drink a lot of the
punch, maybe you're more likely-

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:15.060
(Timothy laughing)

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.963
- All right.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.498
That is what is known as a folk etymology.

00:17:19.498 --> 00:17:20.580
(students laughing)

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:21.510
Like, and the thing is like,

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:23.100
now that's gonna be on the internet,

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.990
and next week it's gonna be true.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.970
(students chuckling)
It's gonna cover the,

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.650
you're gonna have taken
over the cognitive space

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.670
to that explanation.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:34.200
So the reason why, okay, is that a punch

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.260
is a drink that has five ingredients.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:42.260
And a punch like this, count
'em, five fingers, okay.

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:46.886
How do you, anyone know
how to say five in Russian?

00:17:46.886 --> 00:17:47.719
- [Student] Pyat.

00:17:47.719 --> 00:17:49.185
- How do you say five in Polish?

00:17:49.185 --> 00:17:50.018
- [Student] Piec.

00:17:50.018 --> 00:17:50.910
- Five in Ukrainian?

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:53.133
- [Student] Pyat.
- Okay.

00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:55.980
That's why, all right?

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:59.820
It's a rare example of a base Slavic word

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.240
coming into our language, right?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.180
So the reason why punch and punch,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.490
we have that word, is from
Slavic languages' five,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.460
the word for five, that's
where it comes from.

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.040
And so, interestingly, so
that raises the question

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.440
like are you speaking the
language, or is it speaking you?

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.380
Because you didn't have
to know why it's a punch,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.750
like you would've gone through your,

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.070
if you hadn't taken this class, amazingly,

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.150
you would've gone through your whole lives

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.340
without knowing, right, why it's a punch,

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.190
and why I'm throwing a punch,
or why I'm drinking punch.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.300
So are you speaking the language,

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.100
or does the language speak you, right?

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:33.450
Language is interesting because, I mean,

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:37.170
how many of us actually invent
a word and have it stick?

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.003
Relatively few.

00:18:38.003 --> 00:18:39.570
Even in the age of the
internet, relatively few of us.

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:41.940
The language is there for us, we speak it,

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.590
or does it speak us?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:44.760
And it outlasts us.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.630
I mean when we're gone,

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.450
the language that we speak
is still going to be there.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.050
So it's important to
kind of, it's important,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:53.280
what I'm starting to say is,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.420
to disaggregate the
language from the people.

00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.940
So I'm gonna be talking about the Slavs,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.140
and the Slavic language,

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.910
but it's important to remember that

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.250
it's not that there's a language

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:06.930
biologically connected to people.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.880
The language is there
when people are born.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.740
And whether they end up
speaking that language

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.240
or other languages are gonna depend upon

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.720
what happens to them over the
course of their lives, right?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.213
So just to take a very easy example,

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:22.320
more people are speaking
Ukrainian in public now

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.070
than when I was there the last
time a year ago, noticeably.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.470
That's not, that's because
of something that's changed

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:29.760
in the world, right?

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.410
It's because something
that's changed in the world.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.810
Language is not, so
it's not the same thing,

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.510
like when languages move,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.450
it's not necessarily
because people have moved.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.890
It's not as simple as that.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.290
So the way that historians tell the story

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.260
in terms of the movements of people

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.630
is not the same way that
the historical philologists

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:50.670
tell the story with the
movements of languages.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.830
And historical philologists are probably,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:54.810
I think, are probably right.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.580
So language does change,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.920
but it changes more
slowly than we do, right?

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.180
So, I mean, we can still,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.680
we can all read Shakespeare, right?

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.860
If you're Polish, you can
easily read the Polish

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.430
of 400 years ago.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.230
And if you're Russian or Ukrainian

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:08.242
or Belorussian or whatever,

00:20:08.242 --> 00:20:10.680
you can read texts from
several hundred years ago

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.750
with just a little bit of effort.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.300
And although it's weird to
think about vice versa, right?

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.650
Like if you could time travel people

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.870
from like 500 years ago to now,

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.490
they would understand our conversations,

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.560
at least with a little bit of work.

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.110
So the language is there
before you get there.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:27.900
An example that's relevant
for our class is the Vikings.

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.170
The Vikings are speaking,
obviously, you know,

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.770
proto-Swedish, Scandinavian
languages, a Germanic language.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:36.510
They arrive in Kyiv.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.070
Don't worry, there's a
whole lecture about this,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.903
it's the next one.

00:20:38.903 --> 00:20:41.790
They arrive in Kyiv and the
dominant language around them

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:42.900
is a Slavic language.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.733
And what do they do?

00:20:43.733 --> 00:20:44.850
They learn it, right?

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.400
They learn it, and they take it on,

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.530
they change their own names

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:51.480
so that their name sounds Slavic, right?

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:54.420
So what could sound more
Slavic than Yaroslav, right?

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.470
Yaroslav.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.680
But if I say Jarisleif, you
might think for a second,

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.880
say, oh, Jarisleif,

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.010
that sounds like somebody
in an Icelandic saga,

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.830
and you would be right,
and it's the same person.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.200
Or if I say Volodymyr, you'll think, well,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.880
that's the President
of Ukraine, Volodymyr,

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.620
that sounds very Slavic.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:12.810
But what if I say Valdamar, right?

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.070
Then we're somewhere completely different.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:16.620
And the guy who is
remembered by the Ukrainians

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.930
as Volodymyr, or by the
Russians as Vladimir,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.943
was actually called Valdamar, right?

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.960
And certainly like when he, you know,

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.390
talked to his Scandinavian relatives,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:28.223
that's what he was called.

00:21:28.223 --> 00:21:29.820
So they learn the language,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:33.504
they adapt their own
names to this language,

00:21:33.504 --> 00:21:36.030
and then this language
also speaks us, right?

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.140
Then this language speaks us.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.450
Like I was on American
television last night,

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.430
with an American, you
know, asking me questions.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.830
And he's talking about Vladimir Putin

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.650
and Volodymyr Zelenskyy
and I'm thinking, you know,

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.360
more than a thousand years ago,

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.970
a Scandinavian called Valdamar, you know,

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.300
got himself baptized and
now we are saying Volodymyr.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.520
Like it hasn't, my point is that

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.720
it hasn't changed that much,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.640
and we can even kind of
explain why it changed.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.900
Like the guy who was called Valdamar,

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.080
he took on the name, in
this language at that time

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.720
was probably something
like Voldemar, right?

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.690
But he took on a name, and
now a thousand years later

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.140
we're still, these names
are speaking through us.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:14.403
Okay, you get the point.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.530
So language is there between us

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.490
and language is helping to make us.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.710
Now this is only possible because

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.700
some institutions outside of individuals

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.740
are keeping the language going, right?

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.730
And we're gonna talk a little about

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.010
what those institutions might have been.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:38.760
But the big institutional
change is whether there are,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.530
whether there's a written language or not,

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.300
and whether some institution

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.947
is propagating the written language.

00:22:43.947 --> 00:22:46.140
And so a big moment of historical change

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.390
for any language is when literacy comes,

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.730
and that's where we're
gonna be edging towards.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.940
So the conversion, in
around 988, to Christianity

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:56.160
is also the moment when a written language

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.340
emerges on these territories.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.200
But, that said, you know,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.720
it's important that there
was a Slavic language,

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.080
that it was spoken, that it
was not so terribly different

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.050
from the Slavic languages
that are spoken now.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.377
This is a, so this is a continuity.

00:23:12.377 --> 00:23:15.360
This is something which was
there before Kyivan Rus,

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.220
before any idea of Europe.

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.560
If there was a time traveler
from a thousand years ago

00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.170
and heard Ukrainian or Russian
for that matter being spoken,

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:23.613
they would understand that there was,

00:23:23.613 --> 00:23:27.120
that this language had something
to do with their language.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.060
Now, by the way, I'm not trying to say

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.820
that Slavic was the only kind of language

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.050
being spoken then, right?

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:35.400
Other languages are being spoken

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.900
on the territory of Ukraine as well,

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.583
like Greek, for example.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.630
But it was the main language then,

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.090
just as it is the main language now.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.300
And so here we have a very
significant continuity.

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.160
Okay, what was that language,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.200
and what can that language tell us

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.450
about the people we're concerned with?

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:58.020
Slavic language, so how
do we call each other?

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.940
When I was in Kyiv, I was
overhearing, as one does,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.220
it's like an important, you
know, scientific method,

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.960
you listen in to other
people's conversations.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.360
I was listening to a
couple of military officers

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:10.775
talking about like one of their colleagues

00:24:10.775 --> 00:24:12.690
who's going off for training.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:14.070
And the first guy said, you know,

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:18.390
he went, he said he went do Germaniyu.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.180
And then he corrected himself,
do Nimechchyny, right?

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.770
So what was happening there is that

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:24.930
do Germaniyu is not really, that's like,

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:28.233
kind of, so that's not really Ukrainian.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:30.980
It's kind of Russian.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.190
Do Nimechchyny is Ukrainian,
to Germany is what it means.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.963
Nimechchyny, Nimechchyna.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.210
Why is that country called that,

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.060
why is Germany called
that in Slavic languages?

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.160
You've taken classes before.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.073
Have you taken classes before?
Okay, why is it called that?

00:24:46.073 --> 00:24:48.930
- [Student] Well Nemets
means kind of mute in Russian

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.610
and they couldn't understand the Germans.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:51.443
- Very good.

00:24:51.443 --> 00:24:54.840
Yeah, so a Nemets, sorry, Nemets,

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.610
it's the same in a bunch
of Slavic languages,

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.250
is somebody who can't hear you,
can't understand you, right?

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:00.613
So in a lot of these languages up till now

00:25:00.613 --> 00:25:01.770
a Neme or something like that

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.930
means mute or maybe deaf,

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:06.570
someone who can't talk
or can't who can't hear.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.330
So there's, so that, like that tells you

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.040
that there is this ancient barrier

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.260
between people who speak Slavic

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.420
and people who speak Germanic languages,

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.040
and that line is still there, right?

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.080
It's not where it always was.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.430
It's probably, I'm sure
it's occurred to you,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.010
if it hasn't it's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life,

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:27.393
Berlin isn't really a
very German name, right?

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.420
It's not, it's a Slavic name, right?

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:32.880
A lot of the toponyms
in what's now Germany

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.850
are actually Slavic names because the line

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:37.680
between the two languages
used to be further

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.390
to the west than it is now.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:42.480
So the way people use
languages starts to tell us

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.370
where they think they are,
where they think they start,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.110
where they think they stop.

00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:49.230
The word for Slav, which
we're just gonna use Ukrainian

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.670
'cause this is a class on Ukraine,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.270
but if I say Slav in
Ukrainian it's Slovyan,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.980
and the word for word is Slovo, okay?

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:02.070
So as best as we can make out,

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.140
the Slavs thought of themselves

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:05.700
as the people who could talk, right?

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.540
The people of the word.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.060
As opposed to the Germans
who you can't figure out

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.170
what they're saying, and you know,

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:11.670
they don't understand you.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:16.350
So it, so like Slovyanska,
or in Polish Slowianska,

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:19.170
these are people, these are
the people who have the word.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.540
And this, like this broader name,

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.660
it survived into the nations

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.760
that named themselves the latest.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.910
So like the Slovenes
and the Slovaks, right?

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.300
Those were the Slavs who
took on national names late.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.970
And so basically they
just took the name Slav

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.590
as opposed to other people.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.590
Now, that word, Slav, for self,

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.220
which means people of the word

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.320
might mean something else to other people.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:52.190
So in, if you are an Arab
speaking slave trader

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.410
that word means something
entirely different.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:02.970
Al-Saqaliba means slaves, means slaves,

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:06.120
and that Arabic word then becomes the,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.030
goes into the West
through German as Sklavin

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.370
and becomes the English word slave.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.260
So it's actually not a coincidence

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.110
that the English word slave
sounds like the word Slav

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.776
that we're talking about.
It's not a coincidence at all.

00:27:17.776 --> 00:27:20.220
It's historically revealing

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.223
because the people that
we're talking about

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:27.223
were enslaved, right, between
the Baltic and the Black Sea,

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:31.500
usually by slavers coming
from the north to the south,

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.660
and so an Arabic word to describe them

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.220
then comes into our language, right?

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:38.040
With a very different meaning.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.530
It's very different to say
I'm the people of the word

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.680
as opposed to the people
who can be enslaved.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.540
And although, like with the punch thing

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.000
that you could probably
do without the word punch,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.910
but you can't really do
without the word slave.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.770
And so here you have an example of how

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.757
the language is speaking you

00:27:53.757 --> 00:27:55.770
and the language is carrying knowledge

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:56.850
of something that happened,

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:58.227
as it happens in our part of the world,

00:27:58.227 --> 00:28:00.210
the language is carrying
knowledge of something

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:01.410
that happened in our part of the world

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.270
a thousand years ago or more, right?

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.190
And now you know what that knowledge is.

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:07.650
The knowledge is that the pagan Slavs

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.780
that we're talking
about, for a long while,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.530
were enslaved, they were
legitimately enslaved.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:14.430
Why do I say legitimately?

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.780
That's not a good word.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.740
It's because the monotheistic
religions in general

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:22.380
did not enslave their own people.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.420
So they might enslave other people

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.580
who are believers of other
monotheistic religions,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.780
but not themselves.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:32.340
But if you were a pagan, everyone
could enslave you, right?

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.280
If you were a Christian,
Muslims might, and pagans might,

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.080
and so on, but if you're a pagan,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.260
then everyone might enslave
you, including the other pagans.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.740
And so that's an important
point that raises the stakes

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.330
of this whole monotheism.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.943
When we get to the conversion
it's not just this, like,

00:28:47.943 --> 00:28:50.220
it's not just that people
are becoming Christian.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.170
I mean in a way like that's
the least important thing,

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:53.670
and it takes a while to happen.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:56.580
You're, but when you
join the Christian world

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.580
it means that other Christians
aren't going to enslave you.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.020
And it means that you're, you know,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.733
you're part of a larger group.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.730
But don't worry, we'll
talk more about that later.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.730
Okay, so the Slavs, from
their own point of view,

00:29:12.237 --> 00:29:13.350
are the people of the word.

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:15.570
From the point of view
of people around them,

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:19.263
for a while at least, they are
people who can be enslaved.

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.120
So this brings us to what
I want to talk about next,

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.340
which is who they were at the time.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.480
So again, before Europe,
before the conversion,

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.953
means before literacy,

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.340
so we know less about them, right?

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.950
So, I mean the history,

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:42.510
this may seem like a bit of a cop out,

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.490
but history is based on written records,

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:46.830
and so, you know, we have the history

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:50.550
of ancient Mesopotamia and
history of ancient Egypt,

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.463
legitimately the history,
because they left documents.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:57.060
We don't have the history of
their neighbors necessarily

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.120
because their neighbors
didn't leave behind documents.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.700
So when we're talking about
the history of the Slavs

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.070
up to this point where
the sources we're using

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.790
are Jewish travelers or
Arabic travelers, right?

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.830
Or maybe Christian missionaries,

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.230
and just the most basic principles

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.630
of source criticism would tell you that

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:17.820
these monotheistic visitors are gonna have

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.090
a certain kind of bias towards
the pagans that they see.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.740
But those are the kind of
written sources we have

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:25.290
up until the Christian conversions.

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.793
But we know some things, but
we know less than we might.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.490
We know something about the paganism,

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:34.620
but because these people were not literate

00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:36.900
and because they didn't have temples,

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.320
and they were an aniconic,
that is they didn't have icons.

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:42.480
They only started to
have temples and icons,

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:45.513
that is physical instantiations
of their divinities,

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.333
very late in the day

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:49.560
when they were influenced
by the Christians.

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.300
But on their own, they didn't.

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.220
And so there isn't
really a physical trace,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:54.240
not just not a written trace,

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:55.860
but there isn't really a physical trace

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.820
of how they worshiped.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.983
But we know something.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.360
We know that they were, as I've
said, that they were pagans.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:08.130
That means that there
were a number of gods

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:11.070
and the gods were not necessarily divinity

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:12.030
separate from the world.

00:31:12.030 --> 00:31:15.543
On the contrary, they were
connected to the world.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.300
They were connected with things
that happened in the world.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:22.770
This will be familiar from
Greek or Scandinavian mythology.

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:25.710
There, actually there's
pretty strong similarities

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:27.330
between this and Scandinavian mythology,

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:31.110
so if you think of Thor, not
in the most recent movie,

00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:33.510
not that Thor, like I
thought the most recent one

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.250
didn't really work, I don't
know about the rest of you.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:37.350
Like I was in Vienna and I
was with a seven year old

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:39.060
and a 10 year old and I took them to see

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.070
the most recent Thor movie and like

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:43.230
it turns out that it was like 17 and over.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.430
Seemed weird to me.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.010
And I said like together they're 17,

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.548
and they're like, okay.
(students laughing)

00:31:48.548 --> 00:31:49.381
And they looked away.

00:31:49.381 --> 00:31:51.450
And I took them, but it wasn't really,

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.000
I don't think that last Thor
movie really worked, yeah.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.290
Anyway, but if you think of
Thor, the Scandinavian divinity,

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:00.390
you're not far away from Perun

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.770
who is a central divinity
in the Slavic pantheon,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:08.160
a god of thunder associated
with the thunderbolt

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.100
also associated with the oak tree.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.050
Another important god was called Svarog

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.960
who was associated with
the sun and with the crops,

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.990
but the spirits and
divinities were everywhere.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.880
So that's the thing about,
like, about monotheism,

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.470
it's not just that there's one god,

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.780
it's that that one God is often located

00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:26.790
somewhere else besides Earth,

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.200
which is a very strange thought

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.960
if you're not used to it, right?

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.730
Like there's something,
there's something very,

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.550
there's something very ascetic
and demanding and disciplined

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:36.570
about monotheism,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.180
where you put God somewhere
else besides here.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:40.740
Like there's a way in which
it's much more comforting,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.500
actually, to have the gods
kind of around all the time.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.333
Right?

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.770
Okay, so the gods were everywhere
and the notion was that

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.320
you are in constant
relationships with them,

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.520
which explains things that we
now treat as superstitions.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.530
The things that we now
treat as superstitions,

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:03.153
the little physical actions,
are gestures towards the gods.

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.300
Sacrifice, human sacrifice,

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.830
would be part of these relationships,

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.590
sacrificing the right kind of
person at the right kind of,

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.530
at the right time.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.510
If you spent any time in the Slavic world,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:13.380
and you think about it,

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.740
you'll notice that the sacrifices to,

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.590
the spring sacrifices
and the summer sacrifices

00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:23.313
to water and to flame are both
still present in the culture.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:26.160
They're now ritualized
and nobody gets hurt,

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.110
but the rituals are still there.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.993
We can talk more about that if you want.

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:33.540
The dead are still with you.

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.870
That's another part of
this pagan religion.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:40.140
The ancestors will help
you, or they will hurt you.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.150
Your kin relationships extend

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.920
to the dead members of
your family as well,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.690
and so you're supposed to continue to do

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:48.450
certain rituals in their direction,

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.810
which is not really so
strange if you think about it.

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:56.810
At the end, very important
was the end of life.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.840
The end of life is
something that had to be

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:04.770
very carefully met, very
carefully looked after,

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.770
because if not then the dead are angry,

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.530
or the dead are irritated and the dead

00:34:10.530 --> 00:34:12.120
don't do the things that
they're supposed to do,

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.590
instead they do other things,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.290
which is a very fruitful
source, by the way,

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.790
for our own culture.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.790
And probably more fruitful all the time.

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.270
The, if death is not handled properly,

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.080
then the dead are unquiet, and how,

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.730
what's an improper death?

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.450
If you're drowned, if you commit suicide,

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:35.400
if you're hanged, all these things,

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.053
if you die during childbirth,

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:41.490
if you die on your wedding
day, which frankly, I get it.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:43.863
I mean, that's, that
does seem like bad news.

00:34:49.095 --> 00:34:51.690
And if you're not
cremated properly, right?

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:56.070
So religions have ways of
physically handling death,

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.270
not just narratively, but physically,

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.570
and so cremation is
what's supposed to follow.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.510
The female unquiet death, unquiet dead,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.580
this is still quite
popular in the Czech lands

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:07.230
like if you're have anything
to do with Czech culture

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.833
you'll have heard of
these creatures, Rusalki.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:16.080
Rusalki are water
spirits or meadow spirits

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.230
that, again, like a lot of,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.400
actually like a lot of pagan stuff

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.100
this shows up in Tolkien,
things like this.

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.800
Like, if you know about Slavic paganism

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:26.850
and then you reread Tolkien,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:29.490
there'll be a lot of things
which pop out at you.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.750
But they sing you, or they
lure you into the marshes,

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.430
the Rusalki, so they're very beautiful

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:36.360
and they're very attractive

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.203
and they know how to draw
you in, and then you drown.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.830
The, or sometimes they
tickle you to death.

00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.760
I don't know what to make of that,

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.773
but that's a possibility too.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.303
The male unquiet dead
are, it's an easy one,

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.563
what's from Eastern Europe, still with us?

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:57.900
Yeah.
- [Student] Is it vampire?

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.890
- Yes, vampires.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.410
The male, a male unquiet
dead is a vampire, right?

00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:04.050
So, and you know what vampires do.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.572
The vampires, they come back,

00:36:05.572 --> 00:36:08.190
they feed on the blood of the living,

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.830
they take the souls away, they
start with the family, right?

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:12.840
So when Bram Stoker brought the vampire

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.030
into Victorian culture he was working with

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.700
an actually existing pagan tradition.

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.780
And the reason why, so it
appears, and this is now,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:23.280
again, this is not from
historical evidence

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.440
'cause we don't have it, but it's from,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.230
it's actually from archeological evidence.

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:32.850
It appears that when the Slavs
did convert to Christianity,

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:34.380
which, again, don't worry,

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.090
we're gonna talk more about
it in the next lecture,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.040
but when they did convert to Christianity,

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.290
there was a vampire crisis,
which you can imagine, right?

00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.050
Because suddenly nobody was being,

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.350
like even if you do convert,
and remember conversion,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.140
like when conversion is
presented retrospectively,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.930
it's like boom, like the leader
dunked himself in the water

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.820
and suddenly everybody was Christian

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.620
and you know, that's it.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.930
But it actually takes
generations or centuries

00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.490
and there's usually lots of backtracking

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:00.780
and rebellion and so on.

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.780
And even if you convert,
it's a pretty dramatic thing.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.170
And it's very unlikely that
you will instantly get rid of

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.850
all of your previous convictions, right?

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:15.210
And when the convictions are
very high stake convictions,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.910
oh, sorry for the pun,
it was not intended,

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.230
but when the convictions are very,

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:22.770
like when they're very
significant convictions,

00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.300
like will my loved ones come
back after death or not,

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.220
you may want to hedge
your bets a little bit.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.860
So when the Christians
came the Christians said

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.420
no, no don't cremate, inhume, bury.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.770
Right, bury.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.420
But that's not a proper way to die, right?

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:40.860
That's not a proper way for,

00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.850
and so the way that the Slavs handled this

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:47.673
was to keep, in order to
keep the male dead down,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.170
they put stakes through the bodies

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.580
so that the vampires couldn't come,

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:57.900
just in case, just in case, right?

00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.540
And so hence the notion that
the way to stop a vampire

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.270
is to put a stake
through the heart, right?

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.650
So these, you know, these things

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.660
are very old and very interesting.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.590
All right.

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:12.590
So how do we get then
from no written language

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:16.320
to written language?

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.450
How do we get from
paganism to Christianity?

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.790
I'm gonna talk about the
details of this next time,

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.070
but what I want you to see now is that

00:38:26.106 --> 00:38:29.850
the Slavic world was being prepared

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:33.243
for conversion to
Christianity somewhere else.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:38.793
The first Slavic state is
the Grand Duchy of Moravia,

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.500
which is first mentioned in the year 822,

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:48.180
and the first Slavic state, so
Moravia is now in the middle,

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.530
the northern part of
what's the Czech Republic.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.860
And it was being contested
between Byzantium

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.783
and Western Christianity.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:03.680
So Byzantium, the Byzantine
Empire, sent missionaries

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.270
and these missionaries were Slavs,

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:09.420
because remember there were
Slavic languages are spoken

00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:11.640
all over Europe until you
get to Central Europe.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.260
It's a huge amount of territory

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:14.880
where people speak Slavic languages.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.610
So there were a couple of men,

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.640
you might have heard of
them, Cyril and Methodius,

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:23.310
who were Slavic speakers,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:26.343
from probably what's now Macedonia.

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:31.893
They were sent north to
Moravia to convert the Czechs.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.750
And in order to convert them, you know,

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.980
their tool was a written language, right?

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.360
So as Slavic speakers, they
generated a Slavic language,

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.240
which we now call Old Church Slavonic,

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:51.330
and they translated some of
the Bible into this language,

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.973
passages of the Bible, and
brought them with them.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.590
And so in the attempt
to convert the Czechs,

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:02.010
which fails, eventually
it fails, but the attempt

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:04.323
to convert the Czechs
generates this language,

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.640
and this language is accepted by the Pope,

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.300
for a while anyway, as a
third legitimate language

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:15.540
aside from Greek and Latin.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:20.253
So Cyril and Methodius, it's
a long story, but they fail.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.600
Cyril never leaves Rome,
he's buried in the basement

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:26.160
of a little church called San Clemente,

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.340
which if you visit like lots
of people from the Balkans

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:30.640
leave their candles there.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.610
Cyril never leaves Rome,

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.650
Methodius does get back to the Slavs,

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.800
but he fails to convert the Czechs.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.800
But, and he dies in Moravia.

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:43.860
But here's the interesting thing,

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.040
just as a spoken language
is there when you arrive

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.110
and it's there after you die,

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.150
if you can create a written language,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.220
it's also gonna be there after you die.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:58.110
So Cyril and Methodius die,
but Church Slavonic goes on,

00:40:58.110 --> 00:41:02.190
the written language
goes on, it's taken on,

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:06.570
it's taken up in Bulgaria
by people actually

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.650
who are trying to set themselves up

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:10.410
as rival to the Byzantines,
it's taken up in Bulgaria.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.043
The Tsars, as they call themselves,
of Bulgaria, support it.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:19.920
In Bulgaria, this language
shifts to a different alphabet.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.790
The original alphabet
was called Glagolitic,

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.210
but the new alphabet was called Cyrillic.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:28.800
Not because Cyril invented it, he didn't,

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:31.680
it was, he was dead, it
was named after Cyril.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.110
So Cyrillic, which is gonna
be familiar to all of you.

00:41:34.110 --> 00:41:36.780
If it's not familiar, some
of the words on the sheet

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:39.580
are written in Cyrillic, like
I wrote, what did I write?

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:42.780
Oh, I wrote Slovo, I wrote Slovian,

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.790
I wrote Nimecy, Nimechchyna.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:45.960
That's Cyrillic, right?

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.600
That's Cyrillic as it was invented,

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.290
more or less as it was
invented, circa 893, right?

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.290
So you can, if you invent
a language, it can last,

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:57.840
and if you invent an alphabet, right,

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.490
that can really endure.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:03.120
I mean, so the people in
Bulgaria who set down Cyrillic,

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.940
if they picked this up,
they could read it, right?

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:06.773
They could read it.

00:42:06.773 --> 00:42:09.090
So that's something which was there

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:12.450
before the conversion happens,
and it's very important

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.580
that it's there before
the conversion happens

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:18.630
because when Kyiv converts to Christianity

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:22.980
this civilizational package,
Old Church Slavonic,

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:26.640
which is a Slavic written
language, the Cyrillic alphabet,

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.310
which allows you to write things down,

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:32.400
is going to be available
with Eastern Christianity.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.140
And so, you know, not that things

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.490
don't change along the way,

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.920
but here we are more than
a thousand years later,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.530
and it's still, it's an
Eastern Christian country

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:43.530
using the Cyrillic alphabet.

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:47.010
Okay, so that is all generated
for different reasons,

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.050
and those different reasons have to do

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.140
not just with Byzantium
wanting to convert people.

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.680
I mean that's normal,
you would expect that,

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.460
but it also has to do with a competition,

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.230
which we'll talk more about next time,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:06.230
between the Byzantines and
the Western Christians.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:10.050
So this whole, in this, in our class,

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.170
we're generally residing
in this trajectory

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:18.170
which goes Greece, Byzantium, Kyiv, right?

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.910
But there is this other
trajectory, which is real.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.960
And the other trajectory
there is Greece, Rome,

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.263
and then the creation
of this new model state,

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:30.870
this new model state, which has become,

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:32.700
gonna become very important in the world,

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.120
where church and state
are sort of separated,

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.190
where the states are Christian

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.290
but the Pope is not in charge.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.820
That model of state.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:43.830
And the first important
model of that state

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:48.120
is founded by the Franks,
who we'll talk more about,

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:52.020
but the Franks are the ones
who essentially establish

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.633
the political version
of Western Christianity.

00:43:55.650 --> 00:44:00.650
The Franks are the ones who stop Islam

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.190
at the Battle of Poitiers.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:07.190
This is like the kind of
thing, so Poitiers is 722,

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.773
so this is really, so I'm
not sure to wrote that down.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.970
When I say before Europe,
one of the things I mean is

00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:20.910
before the Classical world,

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.940
which is a Mediterranean
world and a Black Sea world

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:28.050
becomes a world which is
north of the Mediterranean.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:30.810
The Classical world is
just as much about Africa

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.160
and what we now think of as the Near East

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.840
as it is about the European coast.

00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:37.560
And insofar as it's about
Europe, it's about the coast,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.940
the northern coast of the Mediterranean,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.040
the northern coast of the Black Sea.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.770
It's not about most of
what we think of as Europe.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:48.390
So before Europe also means
before it gets established

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.920
that north of the Mediterranean

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:53.430
people are going to be
Christians, not Muslims,

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.350
and one of the ways that gets established

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:56.940
is at the Battle of Poitiers in 722

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.470
when the Muslims are stopped.

00:44:58.470 --> 00:45:00.720
In our part of the world
at about the same time,

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.947
it'll be the Khazars who
stop, in the Caucasus,

00:45:03.947 --> 00:45:06.213
who stop Muslim armies.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.230
Another way that Europe becomes Europe

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.760
is not just that Islam is stopped,

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:15.360
but that Christianity
spreads northward, right?

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.823
Christianity spreads northward.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:21.690
The Franks, the other thing that they do

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:26.460
is that they provoke the people

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.130
who we remember as the Vikings.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:30.900
Okay, so much as I'd like to,

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:32.910
I can't completely keep
Western Europe outta the story,

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.130
because the West Europeans
do do some important things

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.610
like Poitiers and like
provoking the Vikings.

00:45:38.610 --> 00:45:41.460
So it's, the Vikings like if you just have

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.053
a cartoon image of the Vikings,

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:46.200
the Vikings come and they destroy, right?

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.840
Like they're just there to take
the gold from the churches.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.420
But the Vikings were responding to

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:53.940
the emergence of the Franks as a power.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.940
And they responded to the
dominance of the Franks on land

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.051
by their superior naval technology, right?

00:46:02.051 --> 00:46:05.100
The way that they fought
and the way that they sailed

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.810
was a response to the power of the Franks.

00:46:06.810 --> 00:46:07.920
This is how history works.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.870
You run into somebody else
who's strong in one way,

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.340
you become strong in a different way.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.370
So the Viking Age, which
begins in the eighth century,

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:16.260
is a response to the power of the Franks.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:20.370
And the Viking Age, although
it includes North America

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:23.670
and Greenland and Iceland
and of course Scandinavia

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.100
and of course Normandy,
the north of France,

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:29.520
and by way of Normandy
the remaking of England

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.500
into the form that we now
know it, all those things,

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.570
the Viking Age is very
important for Europe,

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.133
Northern Europe, North America,

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:38.190
our class is also part
of the Viking Age, right?

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.160
Because when the Vikings
bump into the Franks

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:44.400
and then set all, and become a
kind of counter power, right?

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.860
The power that uses the boats,

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.533
the power that's in charge,
that can move, right?

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:53.103
One of the places they get to is Kyiv.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.990
Getting to Kyiv in the eighth
century, the ninth century,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:59.340
is part of the Viking Age.

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.600
So another thing that the Franks do

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.130
is they set off the Viking Age

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:03.420
and the Viking Age leads to Kyiv.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.010
So that brings us to where we need to be

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.410
when we start the next time.

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.940
Byzantium is trying to
convert from the south.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.700
Byzantium is in a contest with the Franks

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.640
about which kind of Christianity,
under who's domination.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:20.550
Meanwhile, the Vikings have been released

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.590
and are moving around the north

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.310
and are trying to find a
way from the Baltic Sea

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.030
down to the Black Sea in their boats.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:31.410
And the reason why they're doing this,

00:47:31.410 --> 00:47:34.530
one of the reasons, is
because of the slave trade,

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.510
the economics of the slave trade.

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:38.070
They're capturing and they're enslaving

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.140
the people who live, are Slavs, right?

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.220
They're capturing those people

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:42.690
and they're bringing them down.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:46.170
So the metamorphosis
that's going to happen

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:51.170
is when these Vikings have an
encounter with the Byzantines

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:54.780
and decide to become Christians,

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.760
and as they become Christians,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:01.530
the people around them become,
not potential commodities,

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:04.560
but rather become people
to be ruled by law.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:07.710
And at that point then we can
start to talk about a state.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.050
So I've tried to line up the
things that we need to have,

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:12.240
the religion, the language, right,

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:13.890
a little bit of the economics,

00:48:13.890 --> 00:48:15.960
before we get to this
very important moment,

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:19.350
which is the conversion of the
people who are ruling Kyiv,

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:20.569
which is next time.

00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:21.423
Okay, thank you.

00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:28.708

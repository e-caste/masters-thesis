00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.790
Prof: So we know
something about all these

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.501
powerful tools that had been
developed: quantum mechanics

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:12.961
around 1925, '26 actually;
and then all these much more

00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:14.958
modern things,
including scanning probe

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:17.270
microscopy, which is really
quite recent.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.760
But the most powerful tool in
organic chemistry,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.180
for everyday practice,
and certainly for anybody who's

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.181
not a professional chemist and
into quantum mechanics and stuff

00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:32.463
like that, is bonds;
this amazing invention of

00:00:32.463 --> 00:00:36.694
bonds, and how people knew what
things were like before any of

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.566
these tools were dreamt of.
 

00:00:38.566 --> 00:00:39.260
Right?
 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.575
And, for that,
we go back in time and look at

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.720
these guys in the nineteenth
century who invented it.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.580
And we begin with what's called
-- whoops -- we begin with --

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.278
sorry, here we go again -- okay,
we begin with the Chemical

00:00:56.278 --> 00:00:57.169
Revolution.
 

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:58.060
Right?
 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.976
That's a name that historians
of science have given this

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:04.468
period, beginning with
Lavoisier.

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:06.810
So really that's where we'll
start.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.540
But he didn't just spring from
nowhere.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.224
There was a long tradition of
some kinds of chemistry before

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:15.819
that, and we're going to just
review that very briefly.

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:21.049
There's a background in ancient
art and lore.

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:21.819
Okay?
 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:24.470
So, for example,
here's a mosaic from Montreale,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.331
in Sicily, of Noah,
as making wine and then falling

00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:36.780
victim to it and having his
shame hidden by his sons.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.569
Okay?
 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.459
And here's his flask, right?
 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:41.110
Student:  Oh no.
 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.900
Prof: This is like 3000
years ago.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.175
The mosaic is about 1000 years;
it's twelfth century,

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.500
it's 800 or 900 hundred years
old.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.190
Okay?
 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.220
Here is a Roman glass perfume
vial, that's 2000 years old.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.956
So they made perfume,
obviously, and extracted the

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:06.000
stuff from flowers and whatever
that would do that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.310
Okay?
 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.593
There's the Chemical Research
Building when it was five days

00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:12.030
old.
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.758
Okay?
 

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:15.061
And we already saw Francis
Bacon who said:

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:18.430
"All the philosophy of
nature which is now received,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.379
is either the philosophy of the
Grecians,

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.169
or that of the alchemists."
 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:24.840
So the alchemists are in a
sense our ancestors.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.990
He didn't have a very high
opinion of them.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.824
He said: "The one is
gathered out of a few vulgar

00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:33.443
observations"
(that's the Greek philosophers)

00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:36.758
"and the other out of a few
experiments of a furnace.

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:39.597
The one never faileth to
multiply words,

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:43.378
and the other ever faileth to
multiply gold."

00:02:43.378 --> 00:02:46.732
So even at this time,
when science was beginning to

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.609
get underway,
modern science,

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.090
alchemy was already in
disrepute.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.690
But it did contribute some
things.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.728
It didn't contribute much to
theory, because the theory

00:02:57.728 --> 00:03:01.242
depended on Greek,
well on the Greek antecedents

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:04.460
and authority,
rather than observation.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.650
But they did fiddle around.
 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.120
Here's a painting of an
alchemist from 1663.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.085
And remember,
Newton did more work in alchemy

00:03:15.085 --> 00:03:17.157
than he did in physics.
 

00:03:17.157 --> 00:03:17.970
Right?
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.104
And he wrote an enormous amount
but never published anything

00:03:21.104 --> 00:03:21.688
about it.
 

00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:25.352
There's a great website now,
from the University of Indiana,

00:03:25.352 --> 00:03:29.139
of all Newton's alchemical
works, and you can look at them.

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.120
But this was to be kept a
secret.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.520
That was the idea of alchemy,
that it was occult,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.319
it was hidden.
 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.000
Okay?
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.458
And in fact there's a show
that's coming up on alchemy at

00:03:43.458 --> 00:03:47.764
the Beinecke Library,
in January, of their holdings

00:03:47.764 --> 00:03:50.804
in alchemy,
and the title of the show is

00:03:50.804 --> 00:03:52.831
"The Book of Secrets."
 

00:03:52.831 --> 00:03:53.340
Right?
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.750
And that's Harry Potter
as well, right?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.660
&gt;
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.848
So here's one of the things
that's going to be shown.

00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:02.729
It's part of a really long
scroll, which is the Visio

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.408
Mystica of Arnold of
Villanova,

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:10.057
who was a thirteenth century
alchemist who was into medicine

00:04:10.057 --> 00:04:15.098
and was considered the greatest
medical authority of its time.

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:18.209
This particular scroll was
written in England in 1570.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.259
So a lot of it's in English.
 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.983
It says, "the red sea,
the red lune ,

00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.173
the red sol ."
 

00:04:27.173 --> 00:04:28.209
Right?
 

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:30.470
All sorts of mystical things.
 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.192
And then, and you see here is
the corpus, the body,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:39.029
which is earth;
and here's the soul,

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:42.668
which is oil;
and here's the spirit or the

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.120
air, the breath,
which is water.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.199
So there was -- everything was
a symbol for something else.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.495
Or if you look at the four
corners of this,

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:55.666
on the bottom right we have
air.

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:56.690
Right?
 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.632
"Eeyre",
it says, "is hott and

00:04:58.632 --> 00:04:59.250
moyst."
 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.870
Right?
 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.240
Or on the top left is earth,
which is cold and dry;

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.959
the opposite of air.
 

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:11.410
And down here is fire,
which is hot and dry.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.661
And up there is water,
which is cold and moist.

00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:18.750
Right?
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.826
So this was supposed to be
something profound and

00:05:22.826 --> 00:05:23.930
mysterious.
 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.990
Another thing they're going to
show is this book,

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.310
On the Philosopher's
Stone, which was written in

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.470
the thirteenth century.
 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.459
The particular copy they have
is from 1571.

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:35.254
But it looks like somebody's
organic chemistry text,

00:05:35.254 --> 00:05:38.490
after they've highlighted it in
preparation for the exam.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.139
Every word is underlined.
 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:41.050
&gt;
 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.480
Right?
 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.285
And all in the margin are these
fingers pointing to important

00:05:45.285 --> 00:05:45.728
things.
 

00:05:45.728 --> 00:05:46.300
Right?
 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.879
And if you look there,
you'll see great words like

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.240
alchemy there,
you see elixir.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.769
I forget, there are a lot of
key words.

00:05:56.769 --> 00:06:00.528
But fundamentally it's all
nonsense, all the theory.

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:03.267
The reason people kept it
secret, really,

00:06:03.267 --> 00:06:06.144
was, I think,
not to keep other people from

00:06:06.144 --> 00:06:09.088
finding it out,
but to hide the fact that it

00:06:09.088 --> 00:06:10.389
was nonsense.
 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.620
That's just my own theory,
so maybe that's wrong.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.230
Okay, but Paracelsus,
in the early 1500s,

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.490
was an alchemist,
a traveling physician,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.028
and he developed what had been
long before that,

00:06:25.028 --> 00:06:27.500
which was the Doctrine of
Sympathies,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.490
and one aspect of that was in
nature,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.807
antidotes for poisons are to be
found near the source of the

00:06:35.807 --> 00:06:36.528
illness.
 

00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:37.339
Right?
 

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:40.019
So, for example,
you know what that is?

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.620
Student:  Poison ivy.
 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.660
Prof: Poison ivy. Right?
 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.069
But near poison ivy you're
likely to find jewelweed,

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.095
which is an antidote for poison
ivy.

00:06:53.095 --> 00:06:53.959
Right?
 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:57.952
Or -- poison ivy is a New World
thing, so that didn't interest

00:06:57.952 --> 00:07:01.028
the alchemists -- but this one
certainly did.

00:07:01.028 --> 00:07:05.067
Willow -- Salix is the Latin
name for willow -- which is

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:07.050
found in malarial swamps.
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.528
So you go into a swamp,
you get malaria,

00:07:09.528 --> 00:07:11.879
but you also find the willow
there.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:15.249
And the willow bark,
extracting from the willow bark

00:07:15.249 --> 00:07:17.363
you can get Salicin,
a glycoside,

00:07:17.363 --> 00:07:20.336
which is a sugar plus an
aromatic thing there.

00:07:20.336 --> 00:07:21.129
Right?
 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:25.935
And if you hydrolyze that to
get the sugar off,

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:30.322
and oxidize that to make a
carboxylic acid,

00:07:30.322 --> 00:07:32.100
you get this.
 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.440
What's that?
 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.250
Students:
 Salicylic acid.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.940
Prof: Right.
 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.348
Salicylic acid,
from alix.

00:07:37.348 --> 00:07:38.120
Right?
 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.209
So it's good for fevers and so
on, for your malaria.

00:07:41.209 --> 00:07:44.079
Okay, so that's a theory.
 

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.610
This is another thing they're
going to show,

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.440
a Vade Mecum -- come
along with me --

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.526
which is a lab manual that was
kept by Caspar Harttung vom

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:54.199
Hoff,
in 1557, in Austria.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:56.800
So you can see he draws various
-- what he's,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.230
he's reading various things,
and writing extracts and notes

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.649
to himself about it.
 

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.012
It's like your pre-lab
preparation.

00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:04.569
Right?
 

00:08:04.569 --> 00:08:10.680
Okay, and you notice who he's
quoting up here?

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.658
Arnold, that guy from the
thirteenth century who did the

00:08:13.658 --> 00:08:15.012
thing we've showed first.
 

00:08:15.012 --> 00:08:15.500
Right?
 

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.740
Arnold of Villanova.
 

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:20.740
Okay, but he shows distillation
apparatus.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.069
These things are called
pelicans.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:24.430
Isn't that interesting?
 

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.379
And here's a lamp.
 

00:08:27.379 --> 00:08:30.105
And here's somebody,
he's filtering something

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:32.830
through some kind of screen or
grid there.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.490
Okay?
 

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:39.451
So they developed tools that
were of great use to chemistry,

00:08:39.451 --> 00:08:42.178
once chemistry got going.
 

00:08:42.178 --> 00:08:45.303
So there was a lot of -- even
though the theory was nonsense

00:08:45.303 --> 00:08:48.585
-- there was a lot of practical
background in preparing various

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:49.750
elixirs and so on.
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.440
So this was crucial.
 

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:55.610
Now here is a lab that could
easily be mistaken for an

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.309
alchemical laboratory,
but in fact it's an early

00:08:59.309 --> 00:09:01.200
chemical laboratory.
 

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.990
And I'll show it to you here.
 

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:08.440
It's this book,
it's this picture here from

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:14.408
1777, from a book about Air
and Fire.

00:09:14.408 --> 00:09:18.129
And it reports the discovery of
a new element,

00:09:18.129 --> 00:09:19.370
in this book.
 

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:27.600
And it's by Carl Wilhelm
Scheele, who was in Uppsala;

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.158
"Upsala", in Sweden.
 

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:34.807
What do you think he discovered
with light and fire -- or pardon

00:09:34.807 --> 00:09:38.250
me, with air and fire;
Luft und dem Feuer?

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.190
Student:  Oxygen.
 

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:45.529
Prof: Ah ha, we'll see.
 

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:48.017
So that's his laboratory,
Scheele's laboratory,

00:09:48.017 --> 00:09:50.450
or at least some artist's
impression of it.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.158
And here he is.
 

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:55.163
He's before the Chemical
Revolution, but he's an

00:09:55.163 --> 00:09:57.337
important precedent,
as you'll see,

00:09:57.337 --> 00:09:59.320
to the Chemical Revolution.
 

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.080
He was by practice a pharmacist
but he spent most of his time

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.649
doing what is really chemical
research.

00:10:05.649 --> 00:10:09.865
Here's a picture of a stamp,
a Swedish stamp,

00:10:09.865 --> 00:10:11.590
showing Scheele.
 

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.918
Except it's not Scheele.
 

00:10:12.918 --> 00:10:16.759
It turns out the costume he's
wearing wouldn't have been

00:10:16.759 --> 00:10:20.178
developed until forty years
after Scheele died.

00:10:20.178 --> 00:10:25.806
Okay, but he purified organic
compounds, that weren't easy to

00:10:25.806 --> 00:10:29.370
purify;
in particular, carboxylic acids.

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.529
So he got an acid from -- that
he called lactic acid;

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:35.110
which we now know has that
structure.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.000
Where did he get it?
 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.379
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:39.159
Prof: From sour milk.
 

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:39.870
Okay?
 

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:45.048
So here's his paper about that,
"On Milk and its

00:10:45.048 --> 00:10:47.340
Acid" from 1780.
 

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.399
So he purified these acids as
salts that he could crystallize.

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:53.139
That was the method of
purifying.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:56.429
So here's several reports in
that paper.

00:10:56.429 --> 00:10:59.618
Item 7: "Bismuth, cobalt,
antimony, tin,

00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:03.168
mercury, silver and gold were
attacked by lactic acid,

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:06.057
either by digestion"
(that's just sitting there

00:11:06.057 --> 00:11:07.870
under it) "or by boiling.
 

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.195
After standing over tin,
the acid caused a black

00:11:11.195 --> 00:11:14.662
precipitate to form in a
solution of gold and aqua

00:11:14.662 --> 00:11:16.288
regia." Right?
 

00:11:16.288 --> 00:11:19.403
So this is not mysterious
writing.

00:11:19.403 --> 00:11:20.158
Right?
 

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:22.831
It's talking in language that
we can understand,

00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.220
even though it's translated
from German.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:29.154
Iron and zinc were dissolved
with a formation of flammable

00:11:29.154 --> 00:11:29.570
air.
 

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:33.028
What do you suppose -- he
reacted acid with zinc and he

00:11:33.028 --> 00:11:34.309
got flammable air.
 

00:11:34.309 --> 00:11:36.090
What do you suppose that was?
 

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.460
Student:  Hydrogen gas.
 

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.120
Prof: Hydrogen, right?
 

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.441
"The iron solution was
brown and gave no

00:11:41.441 --> 00:11:44.232
crystallization,
but the zinc solution

00:11:44.232 --> 00:11:45.970
crystallized."
 

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:47.548
Why was that important?
 

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:50.908
Student:  He could
purify it.

00:11:50.908 --> 00:11:53.648
Prof: Because he could
purify it if it crystallized,

00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:54.735
and get just that salt.
 

00:11:54.735 --> 00:11:55.158
Right?
 

00:11:55.158 --> 00:11:57.855
So that's how he got pure
samples of acids.

00:11:57.855 --> 00:11:58.370
Right?
 

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.749
"With copper,
our solution first took on a

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:02.870
blue color, then green,
finally dark blue,

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.110
but did not crystallize";
unfortunately.

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.129
And 10: "Lead dissolved
after several days of digestion.

00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:11.755
The solution acquired a sweet,
tart taste,"

00:12:11.755 --> 00:12:13.210
&gt;
 

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:15.033
"but did not
crystallize."

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:15.450
Right?
 

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.667
So what do you do when you
don't have IR and NMR,

00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:20.370
right?
 

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.159
Student:  Eat.
 

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:21.940
Student:  Taste.
 

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.379
Prof: Sure.
 

00:12:22.379 --> 00:12:24.909
So he tasted all these things.
 

00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:27.649
Cyanide too.
 

00:12:27.649 --> 00:12:29.549
Okay, so he got citric acid.
 

00:12:29.549 --> 00:12:31.279
Where did he get that?
 

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:32.049
Student:  Lemons.
 

00:12:32.049 --> 00:12:34.759
Prof: From lemons, okay?
 

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:39.789
And he got uric acid;
obvious.

00:12:39.789 --> 00:12:42.120
He got tartaric acid.
 

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.514
Tartaric acid,
his discovery,

00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:48.529
turns out to one of the --
probably the single most

00:12:48.529 --> 00:12:50.129
important,
maybe the second,

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:52.731
no probably the most important
compound in the nineteenth

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.159
century,
as you'll see.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:55.548
Okay?
 

00:12:55.548 --> 00:12:58.971
That comes from tartar,
which is the deposit on the

00:12:58.971 --> 00:13:02.529
inside of wine casks,
after you've fermented wine.

00:13:02.529 --> 00:13:03.048
Okay?
 

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:09.046
Benzoic acid came from gum
benzoin, a product of the Far

00:13:09.046 --> 00:13:09.809
East.
 

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:10.710
Okay?
 

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.350
And oxalic acid.
 

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:18.389
Where do you think that came
from?

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:21.590
It came from rhubarb.
 

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.330
Now why oxalic;
why oxy?

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:28.009
Oxy means sharp.
 

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:36.798
So what does sharp have to do
with it, with rhubarb?

00:13:36.798 --> 00:13:38.029
Student:  It has a sharp
taste?

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:41.235
Prof: Yes,
so you know oxy as a

00:13:41.235 --> 00:13:42.840
root, meaning sharp.
 

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.418
Oxymoron doesn't mean a stupid
ox.

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:50.700
What it means is sharp,
and moron means dull.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:53.658
So it's a sharp dullness,
is an oxymoron.

00:13:53.658 --> 00:13:56.825
It's a self-contradictory word.
 

00:13:56.825 --> 00:13:57.539
Right?
 

00:13:57.539 --> 00:14:01.840
So what's sharp about rhubarb?
 

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.600
Student:  Its taste.
 

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.379
Prof: Its taste;
it tastes acidic.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:07.538
In fact, the word acidic
comes from the Latin

00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:09.957
acidus;
which comes from acre,

00:14:09.957 --> 00:14:11.384
to be sour;
which comes from,

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.450
the root is ac,
which means sharp.

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.110
So it's the same thing,
acid and oxy.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.250
Okay?
 

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:19.059
So look at all these things.
 

00:14:19.059 --> 00:14:22.090
They have what?
 

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.746
The carboxylate group,
which makes them acidic.

00:14:24.746 --> 00:14:25.210
Right?
 

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:26.668
And we know why it makes it
acidic;

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:29.509
this is a review from last
time, this functional group.

00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:33.990
It's not a carbonyl alcohol,
it's a carboxylic acid.

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.210
The high HOMO is stabilized in
the acid.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:40.172
But it's even more stabilized
when it's an anion,

00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:42.210
because you have a higher HOMO.
 

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.102
So it changes the acidity,
the ease of dissociation of

00:14:47.102 --> 00:14:49.687
H^+, by a factor of 10^11th.
 

00:14:49.687 --> 00:14:50.519
Right?
 

00:14:50.519 --> 00:14:54.830
Which depends on the energy
difference between those two.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:58.860
So if you more stabilize the
anion product than you stabilize

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.150
the starting material,
then you shift the reaction

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.232
toward product,
here by 10^11th;

00:15:04.232 --> 00:15:05.509
a big change.
 

00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:06.940
Okay?
 

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.832
But actually there's more to it
than just that resonance,

00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:11.590
just that HOMO/LUMO
interaction.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:14.491
There's a thing called
"inductive effects"

00:15:14.491 --> 00:15:16.370
that we'll talk about later on.
 

00:15:16.370 --> 00:15:19.298
But a large part of it is due
to that.

00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:21.940
Okay, but you notice there's
one exception here.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:33.649
Uric acid doesn't have a
carboxylate group in it.

00:15:33.649 --> 00:15:35.529
So there's what it has.
 

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:40.058
And notice that it has an
unshared-pair on nitrogen.

00:15:40.058 --> 00:15:43.070
Like an amide,
it's stabilized by a carbonyl;

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:48.077
in fact, it's stabilized by two
carbonyls, two adjacent LUMOs to

00:15:48.077 --> 00:15:49.269
stabilize it.
 

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:53.625
Now if that were just stable,
it wouldn't be a reason to get

00:15:53.625 --> 00:15:55.840
rid of it, to lose a proton.
 

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.174
But the anion that you get if
you lose the proton from

00:15:59.174 --> 00:16:01.000
nitrogen has a higher HOMO.
 

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.139
So it's even more stabilized.
 

00:16:03.139 --> 00:16:06.653
The same trick as in carboxylic
acid, but even more so,

00:16:06.653 --> 00:16:08.019
as you'll see here.
 

00:16:08.019 --> 00:16:11.580
The pK_a of this compound is
5.8.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.389
It's pretty acidic. Right?
 

00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:18.208
But a normal amine,
like ammonia losing a proton,

00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:19.916
has a pK_a of 38.
 

00:16:19.916 --> 00:16:20.820
Right?
 

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.426
So this is thirty-two powers of
ten helped out,

00:16:24.426 --> 00:16:28.110
because it has such a high HOMO
on the nitrogen,

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.090
and two carbonyls to stabilize
it.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:36.490
Okay, so uric acid is indeed an
acid, like carboxylic acids.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.009
Okay, now Scheele not only did
these organic acids,

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:42.542
he also discovered,
or co-discovered,

00:16:42.542 --> 00:16:43.879
seven elements.
 

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:46.500
They're listed here according
to what row of the periodic

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.389
table they're in.
 

00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:51.452
Notice down at the bottom here
you have tungsten.

00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:52.129
Right?
 

00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:53.909
Tungsten comes from Swedish.
 

00:16:53.909 --> 00:16:54.759
He was Swedish.
 

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:56.206
It's "tung"
"sten",

00:16:56.206 --> 00:16:56.740
heavy stone.
 

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.870
Being way down,
it's got lots of protons and

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.201
neutrons and is very,
very dense.

00:17:02.201 --> 00:17:02.928
Right?
 

00:17:02.928 --> 00:17:05.808
So it's heavy -- the stones
that it comes from are very

00:17:05.808 --> 00:17:06.130
heavy.
 

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:06.608
Right?
 

00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:10.828
But by contrast,
these up here are gases.

00:17:10.828 --> 00:17:15.970
And in fact that's what got the
19th Century chemistry going.

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.695
That's what launched the
Chemical Revolution,

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:20.990
was the ability to work with
gases.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.775
Because to be a gas,
something has to be a small

00:17:24.775 --> 00:17:29.848
molecule and therefore simple,
or at least relatively simple.

00:17:29.848 --> 00:17:33.490
So you had to start with simple
things before you could get the

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.428
complex ones,
like salicylic acid,

00:17:35.428 --> 00:17:37.190
in terms of understanding.
 

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:40.499
Now Scheele,
in 1771, had heated silver

00:17:40.499 --> 00:17:45.288
carbonate, and he found that he
got CO_2 out of them;

00:17:45.288 --> 00:17:48.799
he didn't know it was CO_2,
but the gas came out.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:50.509
Okay?
 

00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:55.249
And if you heated that still
more, greater than 340 Celsius,

00:17:55.249 --> 00:17:58.864
then you get silver,
and oxygen comes out from

00:17:58.864 --> 00:18:02.355
silver oxide;
this gas, this

00:18:02.355 --> 00:18:06.609
feuerluft,
fire air.

00:18:06.609 --> 00:18:08.599
That's what the book is about.
 

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:09.440
Okay?
 

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.750
So he wrote the book.
 

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:17.868
But the book starts,
as I'll show you here --

00:18:17.868 --> 00:18:21.108
sorry, there we go -- the book
starts with an introduction,

00:18:21.108 --> 00:18:26.690
a
"vorbericht",

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.440
which is translated,
it says, from Swedish.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.858
And let's see where it says
here.

00:18:31.858 --> 00:18:36.348
And it's by Torbern Bergman,
written in 1777.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:40.779
He had this book written for
two years, waiting for this

00:18:40.779 --> 00:18:42.230
preface to come.
 

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.029
Bergman was a busy guy. Right?
 

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:47.980
And during the time that this
book was sitting,

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:51.382
ready, the manuscript was
sitting ready to be printed,

00:18:51.382 --> 00:18:54.269
Priestley, in England,
discovered oxygen.

00:18:54.269 --> 00:18:56.568
So this book came out after
Priestley.

00:18:56.568 --> 00:19:01.952
But there's no doubt that
Scheele had discovered it

00:19:01.952 --> 00:19:03.029
earlier.
 

00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:05.269
His lab books from 1771 show it.
 

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:10.757
And here, in 1774,
is his draft of a letter that

00:19:10.757 --> 00:19:13.210
he wrote to France.
 

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:16.424
And it begins -- or it actually
begins with a couple of words on

00:19:16.424 --> 00:19:18.174
the previous sheet --
but it says:

00:19:18.174 --> 00:19:20.670
"â€¦since I have no
large burning glass,

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.568
I beg you to try with
yours..."

00:19:22.568 --> 00:19:25.511
Because he had to do this by
heating things in an oven,

00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:28.400
at a really high temperature,
which was hard to do.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.631
But if you could do it with a
focused light of the sun to heat

00:19:31.631 --> 00:19:33.910
it, then it would be much more
practical.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.071
And, in France,
they had such a big magnifying

00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:41.308
glass, that would allow to do
it.

00:19:41.308 --> 00:19:43.970
But that letter,
although it was sent,

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:45.480
was never answered.
 

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.078
And you know who it was sent
to, presumably.

00:19:50.078 --> 00:19:53.755
Lavoisier, the founder of the
Chemical Revolution,

00:19:53.755 --> 00:19:56.380
and another discoverer of
oxygen.

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.818
Okay?
 

00:19:57.818 --> 00:20:01.516
Okay, so now we're going to
talk about Lavoisier,

00:20:01.516 --> 00:20:05.980
who was -- wasn't a perfect
person, but he was really very,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:07.058
very good.
 

00:20:07.058 --> 00:20:09.660
Okay, now the Chemical
Revolution.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.210
You can say it started in 1789,
the Chemical Revolution.

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:17.351
And that's not the only
revolution that started in

00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:18.313
France in 1789.
 

00:20:18.313 --> 00:20:18.890
Right?
 

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.579
Do you know what this is?
 

00:20:20.579 --> 00:20:21.950
What?
 

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:22.710
Student:  Tennis Court
Oath.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:23.750
Prof: It's the Tennis
Court Oath,

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.228
when the legislators,
so to say, gathered to say that

00:20:28.228 --> 00:20:33.051
they wouldn't disband until the
king granted them certain

00:20:33.051 --> 00:20:35.675
things;
and you know what that led to,

00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:36.180
in 1789.
 

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.529
The only guy that didn't agree
was this guy here.

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:43.430
He's the only one that didn't
sign it.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:48.029
But at any rate, it was radical.
 

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:51.536
Now there's an Indo-European
word, that's the root of many

00:20:51.536 --> 00:20:55.234
words, called Werad;
and it gives words in all sorts

00:20:55.234 --> 00:20:56.099
of languages.
 

00:20:56.099 --> 00:20:59.339
Like it means root.
 

00:20:59.339 --> 00:21:01.118
Okay?
 

00:21:01.118 --> 00:21:03.720
And Wurzel,
in German, means root;

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.242
and wort,
like St.

00:21:05.242 --> 00:21:06.829
John's wort,
is a root.

00:21:06.829 --> 00:21:09.876
Licorice;
glukos rhiza,

00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:12.910
Greek, the rhiza is
root;

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.069
sweet root it means.
 

00:21:14.069 --> 00:21:14.599
Okay?
 

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:18.935
Race;
razza in Italian is the

00:21:18.935 --> 00:21:20.788
root of your being.
 

00:21:20.788 --> 00:21:21.569
Right?
 

00:21:21.569 --> 00:21:23.910
Rutabaga.
 

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:29.022
Radix in Latin;
and you know lots of words come

00:21:29.022 --> 00:21:31.630
from radix,
like radish is a root.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:36.358
Or eradicate,
what does that mean?

00:21:36.358 --> 00:21:38.670
Prof: It means to pull
it out by the roots.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.589
Okay?
 

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:42.654
Or radical;
something that's radical is

00:21:42.654 --> 00:21:45.958
something that goes right to the
root, back to the very origin of

00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:46.630
something.
 

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.766
And that word,
used in that way,

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:51.797
if you look in the Oxford
English Dictionary,

00:21:51.797 --> 00:21:55.450
it was coined in mathematics in
the 16th Century.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.828
The root of a number is its
origin.

00:21:57.828 --> 00:21:58.390
Right?
 

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:01.576
If you take the square root of
a number, and multiply it by

00:22:01.576 --> 00:22:03.170
itself, you get the number.
 

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:06.868
So it's the root of the number;
the radical. Right?

00:22:06.868 --> 00:22:09.263
Or in politics,
it was used in 18th Century in

00:22:09.263 --> 00:22:10.836
England,
and in chemistry,

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:14.009
in 18th Century in France,
the idea of radical as the root

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:15.910
of things,
began to be used;

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.920
which we'll see.
 

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.622
Okay, so 1787,
radical was introduced as a

00:22:19.622 --> 00:22:22.653
political term,
according to the Oxford English

00:22:22.653 --> 00:22:25.619
Dictionary, by J. Jebb,
whoever he was;

00:22:25.619 --> 00:22:28.338
presumably a politician.
 

00:22:28.338 --> 00:22:31.085
Or in 1787, there was this
radical document,

00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:32.744
"We the People."
 

00:22:32.744 --> 00:22:33.318
Right?
 

00:22:33.318 --> 00:22:37.828
But that same year,
1787, radical was introduced as

00:22:37.828 --> 00:22:41.616
a chemical term,
by Louis Bernard Guyton de

00:22:41.616 --> 00:22:42.700
Morveau.
 

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:48.502
And it was in the context of
developing nomenclature for

00:22:48.502 --> 00:22:49.769
chemistry.
 

00:22:49.769 --> 00:22:52.693
So he, together with Berthollet
and Fourcroy,

00:22:52.693 --> 00:22:56.349
developed a new method for
nomenclature in chemistry.

00:22:56.349 --> 00:22:58.058
And here's a book.
 

00:22:58.058 --> 00:23:01.358
This is not the original
French, but it's the first

00:23:01.358 --> 00:23:04.526
English translation,
which you see comes from the

00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:07.099
Yale University Library,
back when.

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:10.950
It's from 1788.
 

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.410
Okay?
 

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.786
So A Method of Chemical
Nomenclature,

00:23:14.786 --> 00:23:18.398
by Guyton de Morveau,
Lavoisier, Berthollet and

00:23:18.398 --> 00:23:19.420
Fourcroy.
 

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:25.194
So the fourth author of this
new method of chemical

00:23:25.194 --> 00:23:28.430
nomenclature is Lavoisier.
 

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.950
So there's Lavoisier with his
wife.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:33.606
This is part of an enormous
picture that's in the

00:23:33.606 --> 00:23:34.750
Metropolitan.
 

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.030
It was commissioned by
Lavoisier and his wife,

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:41.240
who hired Jacques-Louis David
to paint it.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.990
And they paid 7000 pounds,
to the artist to paint it;

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.380
which is the equivalent of
$300,000 today.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.240
They were quite well-to-do.
 

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.592
They had an income of the order
of a million dollars a year,

00:23:52.592 --> 00:23:55.309
or the equivalent;
it depends on how you translate

00:23:55.309 --> 00:23:56.549
numbers, of course.
 

00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:57.618
It's hard.
 

00:23:57.618 --> 00:24:02.288
So here he is at the age of 45,
in 1789,

00:24:02.288 --> 00:24:05.118
and he's working on drafting --
so these guys,

00:24:05.118 --> 00:24:06.690
when they had their portraits
painted,

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.309
always put something important
in it.

00:24:09.309 --> 00:24:11.019
So what did he choose to have?
 

00:24:11.019 --> 00:24:15.656
He chose to be working on a
manuscript, and the manuscript

00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:19.400
he's working on is the
manuscript of this book,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.538
from 1789.
 

00:24:20.538 --> 00:24:23.144
It's called Traité
Élémentaire de

00:24:23.144 --> 00:24:26.405
Chimie;
the Elementary Treatise on

00:24:26.405 --> 00:24:27.778
Chemistry.
 

00:24:27.778 --> 00:24:34.603
And the other stuff he put in
the picture is the equipment he

00:24:34.603 --> 00:24:35.400
used.
 

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.525
So here you see various
equipment from one of the plates

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:41.400
at the end of the book.
 

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.680
And you can see these items in
the picture.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.930
There's that bell jar.
 

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:50.170
There's that device.
 

00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:56.401
There's that big sixteen-pint
flask, with a brass fitting on

00:24:56.401 --> 00:24:56.930
it.
 

00:24:56.930 --> 00:25:01.849
There's that valve that you
attach to the bottom of the

00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:02.578
flask.
 

00:25:02.578 --> 00:25:06.135
And over here is a portfolio,
and the portfolio says,

00:25:06.135 --> 00:25:09.145
down in the corner,
"Paulze Lavoisier

00:25:09.145 --> 00:25:10.720
sculpsit."
 

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:13.448
That means this was drawn by
Paulze Lavoisier,

00:25:13.448 --> 00:25:14.598
who was his wife.
 

00:25:14.598 --> 00:25:18.157
She was his assistant in the
laboratory, kept all the

00:25:18.157 --> 00:25:19.923
notebooks;
read English for him,

00:25:19.923 --> 00:25:21.450
because he couldn't read
English.

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.519
So if he had to do anything
with Priestley,

00:25:23.519 --> 00:25:24.849
she would read it to him.
 

00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:25.950
But she drew all these things.
 

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:29.155
She studied with David,
drawing, in order to be able to

00:25:29.155 --> 00:25:29.750
do this.
 

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:36.859
Okay, she painted this portrait
of their family friend.

00:25:36.859 --> 00:25:37.838
Who's that?
 

00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:38.818
Student:  Benjamin
Franklin.

00:25:38.818 --> 00:25:40.078
Prof: Yes,
Benjamin Franklin.

00:25:40.078 --> 00:25:42.846
I showed you that picture
earlier, said we'd refer to it

00:25:42.846 --> 00:25:43.250
again.
 

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:46.830
So this is that particular
plate in the book,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.680
and it relates to weighing a
gas.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.788
It'll turn out that the most
important thing for Lavoisier,

00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:58.804
and for the whole 19th Century
-- all this development that led

00:25:58.804 --> 00:26:01.069
to bonds and their arrangement
--

00:26:01.069 --> 00:26:03.789
weighing was the key thing.
 

00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:05.710
But how do you weigh a gas?
 

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.506
So you need gases so they're
simple enough to deal with,

00:26:09.506 --> 00:26:10.817
and easy to purify.
 

00:26:10.817 --> 00:26:11.440
Right?
 

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.970
But you need to weigh them.
 

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.358
So how can you weigh a gas?
 

00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:19.150
Well you can collect a gas,
as shown in this picture,

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:23.592
by generating it in this retort
G, and it comes and it bubbles

00:26:23.592 --> 00:26:26.910
up,
displacing water or mercury,

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:30.200
most often mercury,
from a bell jar.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.839
You've done this kind of thing?
 

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:31.970
Student:  Yes.
 

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:33.029
Prof: Some of you.
 

00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:34.150
But you can see how it would
work;

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.809
as it bubbles up the mercury
comes down.

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:36.410
Okay.
 

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.130
So now you have the gas.
 

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.442
Now we'll shift attention down
to the bottom right here,

00:26:41.442 --> 00:26:42.950
and see how this works.
 

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.420
So we have this bell jar on the
bottom,

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.509
which is fitted with valves on
the top,

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:50.529
is filled with mercury,
and it's in a pool of mercury,

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:55.369
and then this big sixteen-pint
flask is evacuated.

00:26:55.369 --> 00:26:56.838
You use one of these pumps.
 

00:26:56.838 --> 00:27:01.847
Remember, 100 years before
this, Hooke -- or 130 years

00:27:01.847 --> 00:27:07.328
before this -- Hooke made a
great vacuum pump for Boyle.

00:27:07.328 --> 00:27:11.632
Boyle is the only person on the
front of the building older than

00:27:11.632 --> 00:27:12.315
Lavoisier.
 

00:27:12.315 --> 00:27:12.930
Right?
 

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:15.750
And that was dealing with gases
and Boyle's Law,

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.630
how pressure and volume relate
to one another.

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.027
Okay, so anyhow,
he could evacuate that with a

00:27:22.027 --> 00:27:25.500
pump, then seal it off,
turn the valves off.

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.759
And he's got mercury in that
thing.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:29.990
And now he puts a tip
underneath it and generates gas.

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:36.358
And it bubbles up and fills
this container with a gas.

00:27:36.358 --> 00:27:39.086
And it's sitting in a mercury
pool so that it's not

00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:41.923
communicating with the
atmosphere, other than through

00:27:41.923 --> 00:27:44.269
the pressure,
through the mercury pool.

00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:48.009
Okay, so now he opens the
valves.

00:27:48.009 --> 00:27:52.038
So the vacuum starts sucking up
the mercury;

00:27:52.038 --> 00:27:55.134
that is, pulling the air in,
up to a certain point.

00:27:55.134 --> 00:27:55.630
Right?
 

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.099
Then the mercury stops rising.
 

00:27:57.099 --> 00:27:58.519
Okay?
 

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:02.788
And now, at this point you know
that the pressure of that gas is

00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:06.314
atmospheric pressure,
less whatever the height of the

00:28:06.314 --> 00:28:07.534
mercury column is.
 

00:28:07.534 --> 00:28:08.279
Right?
 

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:11.150
That's how a barometer works.
 

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:16.740
So he knows how much gas,
what volume of gas he has in A.

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:20.960
He filled it with water first
and weighed it to see what its

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.890
volume was.
 

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.230
Now he knows the volume,
he knows the pressure.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.335
So he knows how much gas there
would be, at atmospheric

00:28:27.335 --> 00:28:27.852
pressure.
 

00:28:27.852 --> 00:28:28.368
Right?
 

00:28:28.368 --> 00:28:31.410
And now, of course,
he just turns off these things,

00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.633
unscrews one,
the thing on top,

00:28:34.633 --> 00:28:38.625
and weighs it,
and sees how much heavier it is

00:28:38.625 --> 00:28:41.068
than it was when it was
evacuated.

00:28:41.068 --> 00:28:42.598
And that's how much the air
weighs.

00:28:42.598 --> 00:28:45.308
And he knows how much volume,
how much pressure.

00:28:45.308 --> 00:28:48.490
So he knows how much whatever
gas he collected weighed.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:50.390
So he could weigh a gas.
 

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:53.029
Pretty clever, huh?
 

00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:57.358
Okay, here he is working with
one of these bell jars.

00:28:57.358 --> 00:29:02.160
Now these bell jars were filled
with mercury.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.338
I don't know if you've -- here,
would you help me out Wilson?

00:29:07.338 --> 00:29:09.430
Lift this up and show it to the
class.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.119
But don't lift it high,
hold it above the thing.

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.279
Did it surprise you?
 

00:29:14.279 --> 00:29:14.838
Student:  Yes.
 

00:29:14.838 --> 00:29:17.528
Prof: He said it
surprised him.

00:29:17.528 --> 00:29:20.205
And you can come up afterwards,
if you want to,

00:29:20.205 --> 00:29:23.000
and be surprised yourself,
by lifting this up.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.471
But keep it over this,
because people are so panicked

00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:26.660
about mercury nowadays.
 

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.492
I heard on the way over to
class, while I was bringing

00:29:28.492 --> 00:29:30.710
this,
I heard there's a new law in

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:34.866
the European Union that it's
going to be illegal to transport

00:29:34.866 --> 00:29:37.500
mercury over international
borders.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.759
Go figure.
 

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:42.894
Anyhow, there's Lavoisier doing
an experiment with this big

00:29:42.894 --> 00:29:44.107
thing of mercury.
 

00:29:44.107 --> 00:29:44.750
Right?
 

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.390
He must've been a stout person.
 

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.348
Okay?
 

00:29:48.348 --> 00:29:52.298
This is him in his library,
with Madame Lavoisier taking

00:29:52.298 --> 00:29:55.460
his dictation,
as he does his experiments.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:56.657
Okay, so here's the
Traité

00:29:56.657 --> 00:29:58.130
Élémentaire de
Chimie,

00:29:58.130 --> 00:30:02.390
and I'll show you the -- this
actually is a facsimile,

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:04.568
not the real thing.
 

00:30:04.568 --> 00:30:11.170
But here's the title page of
the first volume.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:12.910
Okay.
 

00:30:12.910 --> 00:30:14.460
So you can look at that if you
want to.

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.848
And at the end,
I'll just note here,

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:22.259
at the end of the second
volume, are all these pages,

00:30:22.259 --> 00:30:27.480
which are devices -- like
here's this is the one we just

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.619
looked at.
 

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:30.828
Okay?
 

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:33.170
So if you want to look at them,
feel free.

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.289
Don't handle the other one
though;

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:36.920
it's real.
 

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.980
Okay, so Elementary Treatise
of Chemistry,

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.538
Presented in a New Order
-- this is the Revolution --

00:30:44.538 --> 00:30:46.039
According to Modern
Discoveries,

00:30:46.039 --> 00:30:49.788
With Figures;
as I just showed you.

00:30:49.788 --> 00:30:55.617
And 1789 is the date,
the same as the French

00:30:55.617 --> 00:30:57.380
Revolution.
 

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.063
Okay, you notice he's a member
of all different academies,

00:31:00.063 --> 00:31:01.240
including Philadelphia.
 

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.503
Why in the world would he have
been a member of the Scientific

00:31:03.503 --> 00:31:04.470
Academy of Philadelphia?
 

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.019
He never went there.
 

00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:06.680
Student:  Ben Franklin
was --

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.630
Prof: Right, his pal.
 

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:10.078
Okay, 1789.
 

00:31:10.078 --> 00:31:12.849
So it has the most wonderful
Introduction,

00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:16.230
called "Discours
Préliminaire."

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.720
And he says:
"My only object,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.249
when I began this work" --
or, "I had no other object

00:31:22.249 --> 00:31:25.819
when I began the following work,
than to extend and explain more

00:31:25.819 --> 00:31:27.945
fully the memoir,
which I read at the public

00:31:27.945 --> 00:31:30.460
meeting of the Academy of
Science in the month of April,

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:33.838
1787" (remember when
radical was introduced and so

00:31:33.838 --> 00:31:37.405
on) "on the necessity of
reforming and completing the

00:31:37.405 --> 00:31:39.660
nomenclature of Chemistry."
 

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:43.804
So that's all he was trying to
do was get a proper nomenclature

00:31:43.804 --> 00:31:46.744
that would be useful,
in contrast to all this

00:31:46.744 --> 00:31:48.349
alchemical nonsense.
 

00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:48.880
Okay?
 

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.640
"While engaged in this
employment,

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.090
I perceived,
better than I had ever done

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.284
before,
the justice of the following

00:31:55.284 --> 00:31:58.357
maxims of the Abbé
de Condillac and his System of

00:31:58.357 --> 00:32:00.369
Logic and some other
works."

00:32:00.369 --> 00:32:02.230
So this is what Condillac said.
 

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:04.705
"We think,
only through the medium of

00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:05.190
words.
 

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.380
Languages are true analytical
methods.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.088
Algebra, which is adapted to
its purpose in every species of

00:32:12.088 --> 00:32:13.903
expression,
in the most simple,

00:32:13.903 --> 00:32:15.818
most exact, and best manner
possible,

00:32:15.818 --> 00:32:20.380
is at the same time a language
and an analytical method.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.275
The art of reasoning is nothing
more than language,

00:32:25.275 --> 00:32:27.430
well arranged."
 

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.382
So Lavoisier goes on to say:
"Thus, while I thought

00:32:31.382 --> 00:32:34.578
myself employed only in forming
a Nomenclature,

00:32:34.578 --> 00:32:37.567
and while I proposed to myself
nothing more than to improve the

00:32:37.567 --> 00:32:41.300
chemical language,
my work transformed itself by

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:43.413
degrees,
without my being able to

00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:45.715
prevent it,
into a treatise upon the

00:32:45.715 --> 00:32:47.730
Elements of Chemistry."
 

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.021
So in the process of reforming
the language,

00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:55.078
he reformed the whole
understanding of the science.

00:32:55.078 --> 00:32:58.477
"The impossibility of
separating nomenclature of a

00:32:58.477 --> 00:33:02.008
science from the science itself,
is owing to this,

00:33:02.008 --> 00:33:06.538
that every branch of physical
science must consist of three

00:33:06.538 --> 00:33:09.195
things;
the series of facts

00:33:09.195 --> 00:33:11.940
which are the object of the
science,

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:15.568
the ideas which
represent these facts,

00:33:15.568 --> 00:33:20.028
and the words by which
the ideas are expressed.

00:33:20.028 --> 00:33:24.557
Like three impressions of the
same seal, the word ought to

00:33:24.557 --> 00:33:28.369
produce the idea,
and the idea to be a picture of

00:33:28.369 --> 00:33:29.880
the fact."
 

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.691
So all these things have to be
harmonious.

00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:33.240
Right?
 

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.769
Three impressions of the same
seal.

00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:40.215
"And, as ideas are
preserved and communicated by

00:33:40.215 --> 00:33:43.291
means of words,
it necessarily follows that we

00:33:43.291 --> 00:33:47.117
cannot improve the language of
any science without at the same

00:33:47.117 --> 00:33:49.440
time improving the science
itself;

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.541
neither can we,
on the other hand,

00:33:51.541 --> 00:33:54.601
improve a science,
without improving the language

00:33:54.601 --> 00:33:57.150
or nomenclature which belongs to
it.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:00.338
However certain the facts of
any science may be,

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:04.460
however just the ideas we may
have formed of these facts,

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.329
we can only communicate false
impressions to others,

00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:11.309
while we want words by which
these may be properly

00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:12.282
expressed."
 

00:34:12.282 --> 00:34:12.829
Right?
 

00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:17.650
So clarity, as opposed to
obscurity, was his goal;

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.119
as opposed to Newton or the
alchemists.

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:20.639
Right?
 

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:26.088
Facts, ideas and words,
and they all have to tie into

00:34:26.088 --> 00:34:30.909
one another as impressions of
the same seal.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:31.659
Okay?
 

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.313
So he presented things,
as he had advertised,

00:34:34.313 --> 00:34:36.753
in a new order;
very different from any book on

00:34:36.753 --> 00:34:38.579
chemistry that had been written
before.

00:34:38.579 --> 00:34:42.309
First was doctrine,
-- that is, the theory -- the

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:46.429
first part of the book,
which is a two-volume book.

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:50.019
So almost all of the first --
no, about two-thirds,

00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:53.179
I think, of the first volume
are doctrine.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.518
And then nomenclature;
that's what he had set out to

00:34:56.518 --> 00:34:56.760
do.
 

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.371
And finally operations,
how you can actually repeat

00:35:00.371 --> 00:35:03.909
this stuff for yourself,
what devices you need.

00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:07.429
Of course, he was very wealthy
and could employ people to

00:35:07.429 --> 00:35:10.070
manufacture all the equipment he
needed;

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:12.579
not everybody could do that.
 

00:35:12.579 --> 00:35:16.155
But he showed exactly how it
was done and gave great -- it's

00:35:16.155 --> 00:35:18.639
easy to understand exactly what
he did.

00:35:18.639 --> 00:35:22.472
Now, one of the first things he
turned his attention to was

00:35:22.472 --> 00:35:23.199
elements.
 

00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:26.175
He says:
"â€¦if by the name

00:35:26.175 --> 00:35:28.920
elements we mean to designate
the simple,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.617
indivisible molecules"
(molecule just means little

00:35:32.617 --> 00:35:35.630
thing, right?) "that make
up substances,

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:39.329
it is probable we do not know
what they are."

00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:41.619
(They're just too small. Right?)
 

00:35:41.619 --> 00:35:43.445
"But if,
on the contrary,

00:35:43.445 --> 00:35:46.090
we associate with the name of
elements,

00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:50.001
or the principles of
substances, the idea of the

00:35:50.001 --> 00:35:53.829
furthest stage to which analysis
can reach,

00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:58.067
all substances that we have so
far found no means to decompose

00:35:58.067 --> 00:36:02.027
are elements for usâ€¦
they behave with respect to us

00:36:02.027 --> 00:36:04.320
like simple substances."
 

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.971
So it's an operational,
not a philosophical,

00:36:07.971 --> 00:36:10.010
definition of element.
 

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.342
If you can't break it apart,
consider it an element until

00:36:13.342 --> 00:36:14.829
you can break it apart.
 

00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:17.349
We have elements here,
the chemical elements.

00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:22.045
Are they elements,
according to Lavoisier's

00:36:22.045 --> 00:36:23.500
definition?
 

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.307
Like here we see cerium,
praseodymium,

00:36:26.307 --> 00:36:29.420
neodymium, promethium,
samarium, europium,

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.559
gadolinium.
 

00:36:30.559 --> 00:36:33.329
Are they elements,
according to Lavoisier?

00:36:33.329 --> 00:36:33.989
Students:  No.
 

00:36:33.989 --> 00:36:34.750
Prof: Why not?
 

00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:35.518
Students:
 You can break them.

00:36:35.518 --> 00:36:38.333
Prof: You can break them
apart, into nuclei and

00:36:38.333 --> 00:36:38.969
electrons.
 

00:36:38.969 --> 00:36:41.936
The nuclei you can break apart
into protons and neutrons,

00:36:41.936 --> 00:36:45.170
and you can break these things
apart into quarks and so on.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.181
But, for Lavoisier,
or for chemists,

00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:49.885
those are elements,
because you don't break them

00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:50.460
apart.
 

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:52.320
Okay?
 

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:54.989
So here's a table of simple
substances,

00:36:54.989 --> 00:36:56.889
in the first English
translation of the

00:36:56.889 --> 00:36:59.090
Traité
Élémentaire de

00:36:59.090 --> 00:36:59.840
Chimie.
 

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.827
So here's a table of the
elements: "Simple

00:37:01.827 --> 00:37:04.159
substances belonging to all the
kingdoms of nature,

00:37:04.159 --> 00:37:07.018
which may be considered as the
elements of bodies."

00:37:07.018 --> 00:37:10.396
So what are the first two
elements, things that you can't

00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:11.239
break apart?
 

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:13.518
Student:  Light.
 

00:37:13.518 --> 00:37:17.163
Prof: Light and heat are
the first two elements -- which

00:37:17.163 --> 00:37:19.690
we don't see in Mendeleev's
table, right?

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.460
Because they're fundamentally
different from the other

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.920
elements, because they don't
have any weight.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.851
You can weigh a gas but you
can't weigh light,

00:37:28.851 --> 00:37:31.210
and you can't weigh heat.
 

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.949
Okay?
 

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:36.429
So he gives new names to these
things -- light and caloric --

00:37:36.429 --> 00:37:38.518
and what the old name was.
 

00:37:38.518 --> 00:37:41.552
Light used to be called light
too, but in his new system he's

00:37:41.552 --> 00:37:44.079
going to keep the old name;
or "caloric",

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:46.429
he's going to use for what used
to be called heat;

00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:48.550
or "the principle or
element of heat";

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.980
or "fire";
or "igneous fluid";

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:52.750
or "the matter of fire or
heat".

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.382
Those were terms people had
used before, but he's going to

00:37:55.382 --> 00:37:56.860
call them "caloric".
 

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.659
Okay?
 

00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:01.869
Now, if you have caloric,
you must be able to measure it.

00:38:01.869 --> 00:38:04.239
If you can't weigh it,
what you can do;

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:06.523
you can use a
"calorimeter"

00:38:06.523 --> 00:38:07.539
to measure it.
 

00:38:07.539 --> 00:38:10.940
And this is the calorimeter
manufactured and used by

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:12.737
Lavoisier;
and also Laplace,

00:38:12.737 --> 00:38:15.909
a younger man who was his
colleague, who became a great

00:38:15.909 --> 00:38:18.199
mathematician,
as you probably know.

00:38:18.199 --> 00:38:19.349
So here's the thing.
 

00:38:19.349 --> 00:38:20.739
It's big.
 

00:38:20.739 --> 00:38:23.579
That's a three-foot rule.
 

00:38:23.579 --> 00:38:25.577
So this thing stood this high
off the table,

00:38:25.577 --> 00:38:25.949
right?
 

00:38:25.949 --> 00:38:27.389
Okay?
 

00:38:27.389 --> 00:38:28.210
Now here's what it is.
 

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.360
There's a lamp that's going to
make fire.

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.268
There's oil in the well of the
lamp.

00:38:33.268 --> 00:38:36.775
You're going to measure how
much heat you get out of burning

00:38:36.775 --> 00:38:37.429
that oil.
 

00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:41.518
So you put it inside this
bucket, and you put the bucket

00:38:41.518 --> 00:38:44.420
in this mesh cage and put the
lid on.

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.485
Then you put that cage,
and its lid,

00:38:47.485 --> 00:38:49.150
up into this can.
 

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:50.039
Okay?
 

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:54.579
And now you light the flame,
in there.

00:38:54.579 --> 00:38:55.960
You want to measure how much
heat it gives.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.500
How do you measure the heat?
 

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:03.320
What you do is surround it by
melting ice.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.920
So the heat will melt the ice.
 

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.809
Now there's going to be a
problem.

00:39:07.809 --> 00:39:10.559
Obviously the more heat,
the more ice you melt.

00:39:10.559 --> 00:39:13.320
But that's not the only place
heat's coming from.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:15.920
Where else will it come from,
to melt the ice?

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:16.409
Students:  Outside.
 

00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:17.960
Prof: From outside.
 

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:20.420
So this is where the thing is
clever.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.347
So there's another can,
outside that can,

00:39:23.347 --> 00:39:26.789
and you fill it with ice,
which is an insulator,

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:28.179
for the inside.
 

00:39:28.179 --> 00:39:31.164
So no heat comes from the --
any heat that comes from the

00:39:31.164 --> 00:39:33.989
outside, melts the outside ice,
not the inside ice.

00:39:33.989 --> 00:39:36.579
Only the flame will melt the
inside ice.

00:39:36.579 --> 00:39:39.739
Okay, and notice that the lids
also are covered with ice too.

00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:43.248
So it's completely surrounded
by ice, and then by another

00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:44.190
layer of ice.
 

00:39:44.190 --> 00:39:47.295
So your flame burns,
burns, burns,

00:39:47.295 --> 00:39:48.050
burns.
 

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:51.409
And you fill -- water comes up
as they melt in both of them.

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:55.405
And then you put that thing
underneath and turn the tap,

00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:58.019
and see how much water was
melted;

00:39:58.019 --> 00:40:00.949
only by the flame, right?
 

00:40:00.949 --> 00:40:03.280
And that measures how much heat.
 

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.000
Pretty clever, huh?
 

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.237
Okay, so that's a fact,
is measuring how much heat

00:40:11.237 --> 00:40:12.190
there is.
 

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.210
But analysis in general is it.
 

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:18.523
This is from the Oxford English
Dictionary, which Yale has a

00:40:18.523 --> 00:40:19.840
subscription to.
 

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.150
So you can look up words to
your heart's content.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.510
It's a lot of fun.
 

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.393
This year is the 80th
anniversary of the Oxford

00:40:26.393 --> 00:40:27.710
English Dictionary.
 

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.726
There was a symposium,
down the hill,

00:40:29.726 --> 00:40:32.697
sponsored by the library,
including the guy that wrote

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:35.219
that The Professor and the
Madman.

00:40:35.219 --> 00:40:37.960
Has anyone read that book about
the Oxford English Dictionary?

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:41.628
It's a wonderful short book,
and the madman was a Yale

00:40:41.628 --> 00:40:42.389
graduate.
 

00:40:42.389 --> 00:40:43.789
Really, it's an interesting
story.

00:40:43.789 --> 00:40:47.425
And the other guy was one who
read the Oxford English

00:40:47.425 --> 00:40:51.480
Dictionary, cover to cover,
20 volumes, within one year.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.739
He wrote a book about that,
during the last year.

00:40:53.739 --> 00:40:54.510
It was a fun thing.
 

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.235
But anyhow, this is -- it's fun
to look up things in the Oxford

00:40:57.235 --> 00:40:58.159
English Dictionary.
 

00:40:58.159 --> 00:41:00.909
And here's analysis.
 

00:41:00.909 --> 00:41:05.963
So you see it comes from
ana, and I think it's

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:10.019
lisein;
but I can get some help on that.

00:41:10.019 --> 00:41:11.309
Student:  luein.
 

00:41:11.309 --> 00:41:12.920
Prof: luein, okay.
 

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.293
Anyhow, but it means "to
loose," according to the

00:41:15.293 --> 00:41:16.440
Oxford English Dictionary.
 

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:19.983
So it's to loose back;
to take things apart is the

00:41:19.983 --> 00:41:20.820
sense of it.
 

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.349
And generally it's the
resolution or breaking up of

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:28.018
anything complex into its
various simple elements.

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:32.769
So you can analyze a passage in
literature.

00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:34.360
Okay?
 

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.550
It's the opposite of synthesis.
 

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.150
Okay?
 

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:45.204
"The exact determination
of the elements or components of

00:41:45.204 --> 00:41:48.474
anything complex;
specifically in chemistry,

00:41:48.474 --> 00:41:52.128
the resolution of a chemical
compound into its proximate,

00:41:52.128 --> 00:41:54.150
or ultimate,
elements."

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:56.820
Now, proximate and ultimate,
what does that mean?

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.155
You can see down in the
historical uses of it what

00:41:59.155 --> 00:42:00.920
proximate and ultimate
mean.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.550
1791, this same time -- 1789,
remember,

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.786
was the Traité
Élémentaire

00:42:05.786 --> 00:42:07.581
--
said, "the quantity of

00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:10.443
charcoal,
which something yields by

00:42:10.443 --> 00:42:11.860
analysis."
 

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.768
So you find out how much
charcoal is in it.

00:42:13.768 --> 00:42:16.949
That's the word -- we now say
carbon.

00:42:16.949 --> 00:42:18.730
So that's elemental analysis.
 

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.693
That's ultimate analysis;
take things all apart to the

00:42:21.693 --> 00:42:24.268
chemical elements,
see how much of each one.

00:42:24.268 --> 00:42:26.719
But there's also this thing
called proximate

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:28.851
analysis,
which you can see from this

00:42:28.851 --> 00:42:29.809
quote in 1831.
 

00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:32.166
"Sugar,
starch and gum are proximate

00:42:32.166 --> 00:42:34.820
principles, and these we
obtained by proximate

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:35.940
analysis."
 

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.628
So you can take some foodstuff
and see what percentage of

00:42:38.628 --> 00:42:41.268
protein, what percentage of
sugar, or what percentage of

00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:42.949
this, that and the other thing.
 

00:42:42.949 --> 00:42:46.072
So what you read on a candy
bar, or something like that,

00:42:46.072 --> 00:42:48.342
that's proximate analysis,
not elemental,

00:42:48.342 --> 00:42:49.820
not ultimate analysis.
 

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.974
So both kinds are important in
Lavoisier's work,

00:42:53.974 --> 00:42:55.300
as we'll see.
 

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.650
Okay, so we looked at light and
caloric.

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:01.782
Now let's look at a few of
these elements,

00:43:01.782 --> 00:43:03.289
the ultimate elements here.
 

00:43:03.289 --> 00:43:09.139
He had the fact,
the theory and the word for

00:43:09.139 --> 00:43:11.179
these things.
 

00:43:11.179 --> 00:43:14.039
So how about Azote?
 

00:43:14.039 --> 00:43:17.179
Why is that word -- that's the
French name for --

00:43:17.179 --> 00:43:21.170
the French still call nitrogen
azote,

00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:25.487
and in this English translation
it was called that in 1790 or

00:43:25.487 --> 00:43:25.920
'91.
 

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:30.070
Okay, where does that word come
from?

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:34.269
What does the prefix a
mean?

00:43:34.269 --> 00:43:37.039
Student:  Without.
 

00:43:37.039 --> 00:43:38.050
Prof: Without.
 

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:39.719
And how about zo?
 

00:43:39.719 --> 00:43:42.420
It's great we have somebody
taking Greek.

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.190
Student:  Life.
 

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.099
Prof: Without life.
 

00:43:45.099 --> 00:43:48.911
In what sense is that an
appropriate name,

00:43:48.911 --> 00:43:51.980
a meaningful name for nitrogen?
 

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:53.510
Alex?
 

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:54.943
Student:  I think they
performed the tests on nitrogen

00:43:54.943 --> 00:43:56.389
first and it was --
Prof: What kind of tests?

00:43:56.389 --> 00:43:57.788
Student:  They would
suffocate like a bird in

00:43:57.788 --> 00:43:58.090
nitrogen.
 

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.485
Prof: Yes,
if you put a mouse in an

00:44:01.485 --> 00:44:04.880
atmosphere of nitrogen,
it's azote.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.710
Right?
 

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.610
So that's what the name meant.
 

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:11.132
It used to be called
phlogisticated air,

00:44:11.132 --> 00:44:15.106
or gas, or mephitis,
or the base of mephitis.

00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:16.010
Right?
 

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:20.000
Azote is the name that
Lavoisier decided to use for it.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.090
Or hydro-gen.
 

00:44:24.090 --> 00:44:26.559
How about it, help us out?
 

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:30.349
Student:  Hdor
would've been water.

00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:31.530
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.409
Student:  Water.
 

00:44:32.409 --> 00:44:34.210
Prof: What about water?
 

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:34.739
Hydro is water.
 

00:44:34.739 --> 00:44:37.440
What's gen?
 

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:39.550
Student:  To leave water.
 

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.454
Prof: It makes water.
 

00:44:41.454 --> 00:44:41.929
Right?
 

00:44:41.929 --> 00:44:46.440
So if you burn hydro-gen,
you generate water.

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:47.260
Right?
 

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.739
So hydrogen.
 

00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:49.760
Okay.
 

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.820
How about oxy-gen?
 

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.730
What does it generate?
 

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:57.289
Students:  Acid.
 

00:44:57.289 --> 00:44:59.429
Prof: Acid, sourness.
 

00:44:59.429 --> 00:45:02.590
So oxygen is the element that
generates sourness,

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:04.039
that generates acid.
 

00:45:04.039 --> 00:45:08.148
And that is the key element in
Lavoisier's theory,

00:45:08.148 --> 00:45:11.000
the oxygen theory of
combustion.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.096
Okay, so oxygen,
plus a base,

00:45:14.096 --> 00:45:16.530
or radical -- right?
 

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:19.938
So these two terms meant the
same thing to Lavoisier,

00:45:19.938 --> 00:45:23.284
the fundamental radical,
the root of some substance,

00:45:23.284 --> 00:45:23.940
right?
 

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:27.634
And you react it with oxygen
and it makes the stuff into an

00:45:27.634 --> 00:45:28.079
acid.
 

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:32.951
Can you think of an example of
an element that you react with

00:45:32.951 --> 00:45:35.550
oxygen and it becomes an acid?
 

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:37.880
Well let's just look in his
table.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:41.550
Sulfur;
you burn it and it becomes

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.344
sulfuric acid,
or sulfurous acid.

00:45:44.344 --> 00:45:45.130
Right?
 

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.449
Phosphorous generates
phosphoric acid.

00:45:47.449 --> 00:45:49.530
Carbon generates carbonic acid.
 

00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.518
Muriatic radical -- which we
don't know;

00:45:53.518 --> 00:45:56.849
they haven't discovered the
muriatic radical yet,

00:45:56.849 --> 00:46:01.150
the base of that acid -- but if
you burn it and combine it with

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.510
oxygen, you get muriatic acid.
 

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:06.079
Does anybody know what muriatic
acid is?

00:46:06.079 --> 00:46:06.539
Student:  Hydrochloric
acid.

00:46:06.539 --> 00:46:07.389
Prof: Hydrochloric acid.
 

00:46:07.389 --> 00:46:09.099
How much oxygen is in it?
 

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:09.780
Student:  None.
 

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:11.210
Prof: None, right?
 

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.115
But that was the theory,
that you take a base,

00:46:13.115 --> 00:46:14.980
you react it with oxygen,
you get an acid.

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:19.360
So there must have been a
muriatic radical.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.039
Okay?
 

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:21.949
Unfortunately that part of it
was wrong.

00:46:21.949 --> 00:46:25.519
The same for fluoric radical.
 

00:46:25.519 --> 00:46:25.980
Okay?
 

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.302
But then there were also
compound radicals,

00:46:29.302 --> 00:46:33.260
radicals that were only
proximate, not ultimate;

00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:37.561
radicals that had several other
elements in them.

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:38.280
Right?
 

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:41.980
And here were some of those,
a list of those radicals,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.889
with the names that Lavoisier
decided to use for them.

00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:48.539
And many of them,
all the ones indicated by an

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.719
arrow, are ones that Scheele had
already discovered;

00:46:51.719 --> 00:46:54.094
like tartaric,
citric, oxalic,

00:46:54.094 --> 00:46:55.570
benzoic, lactic.
 

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.376
Lithic acid was another one
that I didn't mention before,

00:46:58.376 --> 00:47:02.420
which comes from stones;
see, it's from urinary calculus.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.579
Okay, so those were compound
radicals.

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:09.469
And that's the end of today's
lecture.

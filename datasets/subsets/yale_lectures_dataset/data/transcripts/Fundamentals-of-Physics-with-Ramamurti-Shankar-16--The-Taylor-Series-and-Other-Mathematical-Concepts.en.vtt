00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.711
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ok,

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:06.767
so today, it's again a brand
new topic, so if you like

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.650
relativity you would be in grief
and mourning.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.945
If it got to be really nasty,
you'll be relieved that that's

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:17.000
behind us now.
And let me remind you one more

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.843
time that the problem set for
relativity was quite challenging

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.930
because I had to make up most of
the problems.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.932
And they're not from the book,
so they're a little more

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:30.026
difficult.
The exam will be much more

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:33.200
lenient compared to the
homework.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.330
That's generally true,
but particularly true in this

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.100
case.
Okay.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.340
So, today I'm going to
introduce you to some

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.297
mathematical tricks.
As you've probably noticed by

00:00:46.297 --> 00:00:49.380
now, a lot of physics has to do
with mathematics,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.630
and if you're not good in one,
you're not going to be good in

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.765
the other.
And I just thought I would

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:57.590
spend some time introducing you
to some tricks of the trade,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.860
and then we'll start using
them.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.172
First important trick is to
know what's called a Taylor

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:12.251
series [laughter].Okay,
I see this is greeted by boos

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:17.132
and hissing sounds.
I'm not sure what your past

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:21.842
experience with Taylor series
was, and why it leaves you so

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:25.064
scarred and unhappy.
My experience with Taylor

00:01:25.064 --> 00:01:28.045
series has been positively
positive, and I don't think I

00:01:28.045 --> 00:01:31.079
can carry on any of my things
without knowledge of Taylor

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.185
series.
But I'll tell it to you,

00:01:33.185 --> 00:01:35.551
Taylor series,
as we guys in the Physics

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:40.708
Department tend to use it.
The philosophy of the Taylor

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:46.169
series is the following:
That if some function

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:52.480
f(x)--and I'm going to
draw that function,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.541
something like this--but I'm
going to imagine that you don't

00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:57.410
have access to the whole
function.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.778
You cannot see the whole thing.
You can only zero-in on a tiny

00:02:01.778 --> 00:02:05.730
region around here.
And the question is,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.300
as you try to build a good
approximation to the function,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.053
how will you set it up so that
you can write an approximation

00:02:15.053 --> 00:02:19.268
for this whole function,
valid near the point x =

00:02:19.268 --> 00:02:23.220
0, where you know something.
So, suppose I block out the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.939
whole function--you've got to
imagine mentally.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.210
I don't show you anything
except what's happening here.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.230
In other words,
I show you only f(0).

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.250
That's all you're told.
The value of the function is 92.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.590
What should we do away from
x = 0?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.945
Well, you've got no information
about this function,

00:02:44.945 --> 00:02:47.440
you don't know if it's going
up, if it's going down.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.440
All I tell you is one number,
what it's doing now.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.617
It's clear the best
approximation you can make is a

00:02:53.617 --> 00:02:55.735
flat line.
There's no reason to tilt it

00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:58.349
one way or the other,
given the information you have.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.410
So, the first approximation of
the function you will say is,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.590
f(x) equal to that
[f(0)].

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.608
It's not equal to;
you can put some symbol that

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:11.868
means approximately equal to.
It's like saying,

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:16.806
"Temperature today is 92,
now what's it going to be

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:20.456
tomorrow?"
Well, if you don't know

00:03:20.456 --> 00:03:25.087
anything else,
you cannot tell what it's going

00:03:25.087 --> 00:03:28.473
to be tomorrow.
But if you know that this is

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:30.991
fall, that the temperature's
always going down,

00:03:30.991 --> 00:03:33.839
and somebody tells you,
"I know the rate of change of

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.183
temperature.
I know that as of today,

00:03:36.183 --> 00:03:39.069
the rate of change of
temperature is something."

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.837
Then you can use that
information to make a prediction

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:45.889
on what it will be tomorrow.
That is to say,

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.280
for values of x not
equal to 0.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.137
And let's denote by this
following symbol:

00:03:52.137 --> 00:03:56.465
f prime of 0 is the
derivative, which is

00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:01.274
df/dx at x = 0.
And you'll multiply it by

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:05.297
x, and that's your best
bet for what the function is,

00:04:05.297 --> 00:04:08.728
away from x = 0.
What that does is to

00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:13.454
approximate the function by a
straight line with the right

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:17.316
intercept and the right slope.
By "right" I mean,

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:20.319
matches what you know about the
exact function.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:24.466
And if it turns out the
function really was a straight

00:04:24.466 --> 00:04:27.801
line, you are done.
It's not even an approximation,

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:30.529
it'll track the function all
the way to eternity.

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.182
But it can happen,
of course, that the function

00:04:33.182 --> 00:04:36.354
decides to curve upwards,
as I've shown in this example,

00:04:36.354 --> 00:04:38.949
and this will not work if you
go too far.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.433
For a while,
you'll be tangent to the

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:42.329
function, but then it'll bend
away from you.

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:44.764
So, it's really good for a very
small x and you can say,

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.160
"Well, I want to do a little
better when I go further out."

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.571
Well, what this doesn't tell
you, this approximation,

00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:54.310
is that the rate of change
itself has a rate of change.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.097
This assumes the rate of change
is a fixed rate of change,

00:04:57.097 --> 00:04:59.250
which is the rate of change at
the origin.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.741
And the rate of change of the
rate of change is the second

00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.686
derivative.
So, if somebody told you,

00:05:03.686 --> 00:05:06.220
"Look, here's one more piece of
information."

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.687
I know the second derivative of
the function,

00:05:09.687 --> 00:05:14.180
which I'm going to write as
f double prime at 0.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.539
Well, with that information,
you can build a better

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.087
approximation to the function,
and you will put that in

00:05:19.087 --> 00:05:22.341
x^(2).
But the key thing is you've got

00:05:22.341 --> 00:05:25.900
to divide by 2,
but if you like 2 factorial.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.100
And the way you divide by the
2, because your goal is take

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.115
this approximation and make sure
that that's whatever you know

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:40.550
about the function built into
it.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.889
Right?
Let's check this approximation

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.889
and see if it satisfies those
properties.

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.205
First of all,
at x = 0,

00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:50.704
let's compare the two sides.
At x = 0,

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:53.120
the left hand side is
f(0).

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.709
On the right hand side,
when you put x = 0,

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.300
you kill this and you kill this
and it matches.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.620
So, you've certainly got the
right value of the function.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.585
Then you say,
"What if I take the derivative

00:06:03.585 --> 00:06:06.000
of the function at x =
0?"

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.566
Let's take the derivative of
this trial function,

00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:10.920
or the approximate function on
both sides.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.998
When I take the derivative,
that being a constant,

00:06:14.998 --> 00:06:20.957
does not contribute.
This derivative of x is

00:06:20.957 --> 00:06:22.328
1.
In the next one,

00:06:22.328 --> 00:06:24.905
the derivative of x^(2)
is 2x,

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:28.141
2x cancels the 2,
so I get f double prime

00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:31.182
of 0 times x.
But now, evaluate the

00:06:31.182 --> 00:06:35.001
derivative at x = 0.
That gets rid of this guy,

00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:39.068
and the derivative of my test
function matches the derivative

00:06:39.068 --> 00:06:42.074
of the actual function,
because this is the actual

00:06:42.074 --> 00:06:43.750
derivative of the actual
function.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.735
Now, it follows that if you
want to say, "How about the

00:06:47.735 --> 00:06:50.540
second derivative of this
function?"

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.649
let's take the test function I
have, or the approximation.

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:57.578
Take a second derivative,
and make sure that comes out

00:06:57.578 --> 00:06:59.374
right.
I don't feel like writing this

00:06:59.374 --> 00:07:01.089
out, but try to do this in your
head.

00:07:01.089 --> 00:07:04.100
Take two derivatives on the
left-hand side and see what

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.788
happens on the right hand side.
Well, if you take one

00:07:06.788 --> 00:07:09.415
derivative, this guy's gone.
If you take two derivatives,

00:07:09.415 --> 00:07:12.380
this guy's gone.
And then, if you take the first

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.407
derivative, you get 2x,
you take the second derivative

00:07:16.407 --> 00:07:20.920
you get 2, the 2 cancels the 2.
Now, if you put x = 0.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.413
If you do, you find that
f(0) here matches the

00:07:24.413 --> 00:07:28.310
second derivative of the
function on the left-hand side.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.863
So, this 2 factorial is there
to make sure that the function

00:07:31.863 --> 00:07:35.477
you have cooked up has the right
value of the function at the

00:07:35.477 --> 00:07:37.622
origin,
has the right slope at the

00:07:37.622 --> 00:07:40.759
origin, has the right rate of
change of the slope at the

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:42.736
origin.
Well, it's very clear what we

00:07:42.736 --> 00:07:45.507
should do.
If you had a whole bunch of

00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:49.898
derivatives, then the
approximation we will write will

00:07:49.898 --> 00:07:53.129
look like, f n-th
derivative.

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:56.520
I cannot draw n primes
there, so n means

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:59.718
n such primes,
x to the n over

00:07:59.718 --> 00:08:03.310
n factorial.
And you go as far as you can.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.730
If you know 13 derivatives,
put 13 derivatives here.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.325
That's an approximation.
That's not called a Taylor

00:08:10.325 --> 00:08:12.470
series, that's the approximation
to the function.

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.595
Now, it may happen that
sometimes you hit the jackpot,

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:19.319
and you know all the
derivatives.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.361
Someone tells you all the
derivatives of the function,

00:08:22.361 --> 00:08:24.850
then why stop?
Add them all up.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.653
Then, you will get the sum
going from the 0 derivative all

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:33.634
the way up to infinity.
And if you do the summation of

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:36.570
every value of x,
you will get a value,

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.193
and if that summation is
meaningful and gives you a

00:08:39.193 --> 00:08:40.820
finite number,
that, in fact,

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.540
is exactly the function you
were given.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:48.710
That is the Taylor series.
The Taylor series is a series

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.412
of infinite number of terms
which, if you sum up -- and sum

00:08:52.412 --> 00:08:56.113
up to something sensible -- will
actually be as good as the

00:08:56.113 --> 00:08:59.900
left-hand side.
So, let me give you one example.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.436
Here's a famous example.
1 over 1 minus x is the

00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:07.943
real function.
You and I know this function,

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:10.760
we know how to put it in a
calculator;

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.285
we know how to plot it.
You give me an x and I

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:15.270
stick it in the denominator,
subtract it from 1,

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.529
invert it;
that's the function.

00:09:17.529 --> 00:09:20.784
But instead,
suppose this function was

00:09:20.784 --> 00:09:25.442
revealed to us in stages.
We were told f(0)--what

00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:29.267
is f(0) here?
Put the x equal to 0,

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:32.935
f(0) is 1.
Now, let's take the derivative

00:09:32.935 --> 00:09:35.320
of this function,
df/dx.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.436
df/dx has a minus 1
because it's 1 minus x to

00:09:41.436 --> 00:09:46.485
the minus 1, times a square;
then the derivative of what's

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:49.019
inside this, that gives you a
minus 1.

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:52.604
This is simple calculus,
how to take the derivative of

00:09:52.604 --> 00:09:56.059
this fellow here.
Having taken the derivative,

00:09:56.059 --> 00:09:59.313
evaluate it at x = 0,
this vanishes,

00:09:59.313 --> 00:10:01.870
that becomes 1,
and you get 1.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:05.430
If you now take the second
derivative of this function,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:10.439
which I don't feel like doing,
and I evaluate that at x

00:10:10.439 --> 00:10:14.929
= 0, then I'll find it is equal
to 2 factorial.

00:10:14.929 --> 00:10:17.679
In fact, I'll find the
nth derivative at the

00:10:17.679 --> 00:10:21.940
origin to be n factorial.
Well, that's very nice.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.489
Because then,
my approximation to the

00:10:25.489 --> 00:10:30.321
function begins as 1 plus
x times the first

00:10:30.321 --> 00:10:33.656
derivative,
which happens to be 1 plus

00:10:33.656 --> 00:10:37.870
x^(2) over 2 factorial
times the second derivative,

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:42.477
which happens to be 2 factorial
plus x^(3) over 3

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:47.287
factorial times 3 factorial,
so you can see where this guy

00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:51.518
is going.
It looks like 1 + x + x^(2),

00:10:51.518 --> 00:10:56.640
et cetera.
The Taylor series is its

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.823
infinite sum.
In practice,

00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:03.840
you may be happy to just keep a
couple of terms.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.144
So, let's get a feeling for
what those couple of terms can

00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:12.650
do for us.
So, let me take x = 0.1.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:18.398
x equal to point 1;
the real answer is 1 over 1

00:11:18.398 --> 00:11:22.097
minus point 1,
which is 1 over point 9,

00:11:22.097 --> 00:11:24.920
which is 1.1111,
etcetera.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.600
That's the target.
What do you do with the series?

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.472
The series starts at 1,
times one-tenth,

00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:37.749
plus 1 over 100,
plus 1 over 1000,

00:11:37.749 --> 00:11:40.107
and so on.
And you can see,

00:11:40.107 --> 00:11:43.616
as I keep more and more terms,
I keep just filling up these

00:11:43.616 --> 00:11:46.811
ones.
If you stop at 1 over 1000,

00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:51.345
you stop right there.
So, this is the exact answer,

00:11:51.345 --> 00:11:54.417
this is the approximation.
But it's clear to you,

00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:56.808
perhaps in a simple example,
that if you kept all the terms

00:11:56.808 --> 00:11:59.649
of the series,
you really will get this

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:02.680
infinite number of recurring
1's.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:06.417
So, that is the function.
That is the Taylor

00:12:06.417 --> 00:12:09.381
approximation.
We'll just chop it off whenever

00:12:09.381 --> 00:12:11.572
you want, and it's a good
approximation,

00:12:11.572 --> 00:12:15.820
and that's the Taylor series.
The series means sum everything.

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.230
Now, summing an infinite number
of numbers is a delicate issue.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.965
I don't want to go there at
all, I discuss that in this math

00:12:22.965 --> 00:12:24.802
book.
But sometimes a sum makes no

00:12:24.802 --> 00:12:29.220
sense, then you've got to quit.
For example, put x = 2.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:35.529
The correct function is 1 - 2,
which is -1.

00:12:35.529 --> 00:12:44.580
Our approximation for x
= 2 looks like 1 + 2 + 4 + 8.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.580
Fist of all,
this sum is going to grow to

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:49.679
infinity, because the numbers
are getting bigger and bigger.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:51.269
This sum seems to be all
positive;

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:53.000
that is the correct answer is
negative.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.850
Obviously, the series doesn't
work.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.723
So, the next lesson of our
Taylor series is,

00:12:58.723 --> 00:13:02.332
you can write down the series,
but it may not sum up to

00:13:02.332 --> 00:13:05.340
anything sensible beyond a
certain range.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.105
So, if you're doing a Taylor
series at x = 0,

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.870
and you go to x = 2,
it just doesn't work.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.220
So, you can ask,
"How far can I go from the

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.394
origin?"
Well, in this simple example,

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:18.289
we know that x = 1,
the function just going to

00:13:18.289 --> 00:13:20.850
infinity, that's why you
couldn't go there.

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.409
And you cannot go to the
right-hand side of that point.

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:26.662
The function is well defined on
the other side,

00:13:26.662 --> 00:13:28.914
but this series,
this knowledge of the function

00:13:28.914 --> 00:13:31.509
here, is not enough to get you
on the other side.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:36.114
So, this is a case where there
are obvious problems at x

00:13:36.114 --> 00:13:38.502
= 1.
But if I wrote a function like

00:13:38.502 --> 00:13:41.286
1 over 1 plus x^(2),
that's a nice function,

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:44.818
got no troubles anywhere.
And yet, if you took the Taylor

00:13:44.818 --> 00:13:47.258
series for it,
you will find if you go beyond

00:13:47.258 --> 00:13:50.639
absolute value at x = 1,
the series makes no sense.

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:54.789
So, I don't want to do that
mathematical theory of series.

00:13:54.789 --> 00:13:58.303
I just want to tell you that
functions can be approximated by

00:13:58.303 --> 00:14:00.098
series.
And if you're lucky,

00:14:00.098 --> 00:14:03.650
you can do the whole sum if you
know all the derivatives,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.330
and the whole sum may converge
to give a finite answer.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.529
In which case,
it's as good as the function.

00:14:09.529 --> 00:14:11.820
One guy can use 1over 1 minus
x;

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.893
the other one can use the
infinite series,

00:14:13.893 --> 00:14:16.524
and they're morally and
mathematically in every sense

00:14:16.524 --> 00:14:18.692
equal,
as long as they don't stray

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:22.080
outside the region of validity
of the infinite series.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.724
Ok, so the most popular example
that I've been using in the

00:14:27.724 --> 00:14:31.519
class, remember,
is 1 + x^(n).

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:34.950
That's a function we can do
with Taylor series.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.783
f(0) is 1.
What's the derivative of the

00:14:39.783 --> 00:14:42.269
function?
It's n times 1 plus

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:46.915
x^(n) minus 1.
The x is n times

00:14:46.915 --> 00:14:52.262
1 plus x^(n) minus 1;
if I evaluate it at x =

00:14:52.262 --> 00:14:55.418
0, it is just n.
That's why we get this famous

00:14:55.418 --> 00:14:57.330
result we've been using all the
time.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.660
If x is small enough you
stop there, because the next

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.370
time it's going to involve an
x^(2) and an

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:05.405
x^(3),
then if x is tiny,

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.730
we have no respect for
x^(2) and x^(3),

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.597
we just cut it off.
But if you want the next

00:15:09.597 --> 00:15:11.669
term--one of you guys even asked
me, "What happens next?"

00:15:11.669 --> 00:15:13.360
we'll take the second
derivative.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.515
You can see it's n times n
minus 1, times 1 plus x^(n)

00:15:17.515 --> 00:15:19.882
minus 2.
If you put x = 0,

00:15:19.882 --> 00:15:22.652
you'll get n times
n minus 1,

00:15:22.652 --> 00:15:24.960
x^(2),
and don't forget the 2

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.078
factorial.
So, what I've been doing is

00:15:28.078 --> 00:15:30.916
I've been saying 1 plus
x^(n),

00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:34.805
approximately equal to this.
But even if you keep that,

00:15:34.805 --> 00:15:37.360
it's still approximate.
But it's a good approximation;

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.039
how many terms you want to keep
depends on how tiny x is.

00:15:41.039 --> 00:15:44.517
Ok, so it's good to know
there's an infinite series,

00:15:44.517 --> 00:15:48.677
but it's also good to know you
can chop it off and do business

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:52.750
with a few terms.
In fact, all of relativity we

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.705
reduce as follows.
The energy of a particle is

00:15:56.705 --> 00:16:01.157
this, which we can write as
mc^(2) times 1 minus

00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:05.279
v^(2) over c^(2)
to the minus ½.

00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:09.150
If you expand this in a power
series, you're going to get

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.570
mc^(2) + ½
mv^(2),

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.922
plus stuff involving v
to the 4th over c to the

00:16:14.922 --> 00:16:17.740
4th times c^(2).
We dropped all this,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.361
and for 300 years we did
mechanics keeping just this

00:16:21.361 --> 00:16:23.792
term.
We just kept that first

00:16:23.792 --> 00:16:27.517
non-trivial term,
and all of our collisions and

00:16:27.517 --> 00:16:30.999
so on that we did,
used only that up to that

00:16:30.999 --> 00:16:33.134
point.
So, the approximations have

00:16:33.134 --> 00:16:35.116
really been useful,
and they describe nature

00:16:35.116 --> 00:16:36.857
approximately.
If you say, "Well,

00:16:36.857 --> 00:16:39.570
I want to be exact," you can go
back and use this.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.415
Unfortunately,
generally somebody tells you,

00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:43.469
"That's not exactly.
There in quantum mechanics,

00:16:43.469 --> 00:16:44.990
tells you the whole thing is
wrong."

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.901
At every stage,
you will have to give up

00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:49.389
something.
So, I have a lot of respect for

00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:51.741
approximations.
If you could not describe the

00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:54.010
world approximately,
you couldn't have come where

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:56.403
you've come.
Because no one knows the exact

00:16:56.403 --> 00:16:58.759
answer to a single question you
can pose.

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:00.743
Ask me a question,
and the answer is,

00:17:00.743 --> 00:17:03.426
"I don't know."
Second part of the answer is,

00:17:03.426 --> 00:17:05.971
"Nobody knows."
Because if your question says

00:17:05.971 --> 00:17:09.080
give an answer to arbitrary
precision, any question asked,

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.760
we just don't know.
Newtonian mechanics works for

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.491
small velocities.
All of relativistic mechanics

00:17:16.491 --> 00:17:19.968
works for any velocity,
but not for really tiny

00:17:19.968 --> 00:17:22.241
objects.
Then you've got to use quantum

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:25.228
mechanics.
So, always theories give way to

00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:28.638
new theories,
and so approximations are very

00:17:28.638 --> 00:17:30.880
important.
So, you have to learn this.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:36.755
Okay.
So now, I'm going to consider

00:17:36.755 --> 00:17:41.690
the following function:
e^(x).

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.432
Now ,this guy is something you
all know and love,

00:17:51.432 --> 00:17:54.089
because it's one nice thing
about the function,

00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:56.400
is every derivative is
e^(x).

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.349
Right?
Every child knows e^(x)

00:17:59.349 --> 00:18:02.030
has got e^(x) as its
derivative.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:05.112
Why do we like that here?
That means all the derivatives

00:18:05.112 --> 00:18:07.798
are sitting in front of you.
They're e^(x),

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:10.621
and at x = 0,
e to the 0 is 1,

00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:14.173
so every derivative is 1.
And the function is very easy

00:18:14.173 --> 00:18:17.317
to write down.
It is really 1 + x +

00:18:17.317 --> 00:18:22.252
x^(2) over 2 factorial,
plus x to the 3 over 3

00:18:22.252 --> 00:18:26.349
factorial, x to the 4
over 4 factorial.

00:18:26.349 --> 00:18:28.915
You can go on like this,
and if you like to use a

00:18:28.915 --> 00:18:31.481
compact notation,
it's x^(n) over n

00:18:31.481 --> 00:18:34.651
factorial,
and going from 0 to infinity,

00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:37.740
that 0 factorial is defined to
be 1.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.864
That's e^(x).
If you ever forget the value of

00:18:42.864 --> 00:18:46.779
e, and I need to know the
value of e,

00:18:46.779 --> 00:18:50.365
because when I lock my suitcase
and check it into the airport,

00:18:50.365 --> 00:18:52.539
I use either e or
π,

00:18:52.539 --> 00:18:55.429
because they're the only two
numbers I can remember--So,

00:18:55.429 --> 00:18:57.319
if I forget the value of
e,

00:18:57.319 --> 00:19:02.445
I just say e is the same
as e to the 1,

00:19:02.445 --> 00:19:06.289
so I've got 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1
over 6,

00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:10.623
and pretty soon I'm telling the
guy scanning my luggage,

00:19:10.623 --> 00:19:14.132
"That's my code."
And it's much better than any

00:19:14.132 --> 00:19:17.185
other code because I cannot
reconstruct, say,

00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:19.930
my grandfather's name.
I may not get it right.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.630
I may not construct my house
address, or my phone address.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.373
This doesn't change.
I've been moving around all

00:19:25.373 --> 00:19:27.849
over the world,
this is a very reliable number.

00:19:27.849 --> 00:19:30.565
Now, π is a good
number, but rules for computing

00:19:30.565 --> 00:19:32.539
π are somewhat more
difficult.

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:35.003
π also can be computed
as an infinite series,

00:19:35.003 --> 00:19:37.947
but this guy is very easy.
There's 2 point in 7-7

00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:41.390
something, that is e.
Okay.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:44.240
Now, here is the very nice
property of this series.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.293
It is good for any x.
You remember the series for 1

00:19:48.293 --> 00:19:52.040
over 1 minus x crashed
and burned at x = 1.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.137
This series -- always good.
You put x = 37 million,

00:19:56.137 --> 00:19:59.008
you've got 37 million,
37 million cubed,

00:19:59.008 --> 00:20:02.410
37 million at the 4th power;
don't worry.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.429
These factorials downstairs
will tame it down and make it

00:20:05.429 --> 00:20:08.556
converge, and will give you
e to the whatever number

00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:10.573
I give.
That's something I'm not

00:20:10.573 --> 00:20:12.946
proving, but the series for
e^(x),

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:16.259
no limits on validity.
All right.

00:20:16.259 --> 00:20:18.279
Then, we take the function,
cos x.

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:24.560
Now, cos x,
we all know and love as this

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.428
guy.
That's got a period of

00:20:26.428 --> 00:20:29.416
2π.
But we can write a series for

00:20:29.416 --> 00:20:33.157
it because it's a function.
And what do I need to know to

00:20:33.157 --> 00:20:35.936
write the series for it?
I need to know the value of the

00:20:35.936 --> 00:20:39.619
function at the origin.
So, we know cosine of 0 is 1.

00:20:39.619 --> 00:20:45.064
If you take the derivative you
get minus sine,

00:20:45.064 --> 00:20:50.168
and its value at 0 is 0.
You take one more derivative,

00:20:50.168 --> 00:20:52.869
you get minus cosine 0,
which is minus 1,

00:20:52.869 --> 00:20:55.569
and I think by now you get the
point.

00:20:55.569 --> 00:20:58.923
Every other derivative will
vanish, and the remaining

00:20:58.923 --> 00:21:02.470
derivatives will alternate in
sine from 1 to minus 1.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.868
That means, if you crank it
out, you will get 1,

00:21:04.868 --> 00:21:07.573
you won't have anything linear
in x because the

00:21:07.573 --> 00:21:10.380
coefficient of that is
sin 0 which vanishes;

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.818
then you'll get x^(2)
over 2 factorial plus x

00:21:13.818 --> 00:21:16.130
to the 4 over 4 factorial,
and so on.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.686
This is cos x.
If you cut it off after some

00:21:25.686 --> 00:21:30.059
number of terms,
it's not going to work.

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:31.927
In the beginning,
1 minus x^(2) looks very

00:21:31.927 --> 00:21:33.626
good.
This is 1 minus x^(2)

00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:35.664
over 2, looks like this.
But eventually,

00:21:35.664 --> 00:21:38.775
this approximation will go bad
on you, because x to the

00:21:38.775 --> 00:21:41.890
4th is just x to the 4th.
It'll grow without limit.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.624
No one's telling you this
approximation has a property

00:21:44.624 --> 00:21:47.588
that cosine is less than 1.
It doesn't satisfy that,

00:21:47.588 --> 00:21:50.769
because you're not supposed to
use it that far out.

00:21:50.769 --> 00:21:53.813
But if you keep all the terms,
then in fact,

00:21:53.813 --> 00:21:57.210
even though x to the 4th
is taking off,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.925
x to the minus 6 is
saying hey, come down,

00:21:58.925 --> 00:22:00.319
x to the 8th is saying,
go up.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:03.827
You add them all together,
remarkably, you will reproduce

00:22:03.827 --> 00:22:07.101
this function.
Very hard to imagine that the

00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:10.860
cosine that we know as
oscillatory is really this

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.528
function.
And I hope all of you know

00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:16.119
enough to know how to find the
series.

00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:19.214
You should know the derivative
of cosine is minus sine,

00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.220
the derivative of sine is
cosine.

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.359
And evaluate them at the origin;
I say you can build up the

00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:27.130
series.
Then, if you do similar tricks

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.549
for sin x,
sin of 0 is 0,

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:32.827
derivative of sin is cosine,
and of course,

00:22:32.827 --> 00:22:36.050
n of 0 is 1.
So, the first derivative is 1;

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:38.367
that gives you this term.
Next one won't give you

00:22:38.367 --> 00:22:40.547
anything, the one after that
will give you this,

00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:42.450
and this guy will go on like
this one.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:50.206
Okay.
So, these are series for

00:22:50.206 --> 00:22:51.741
e^(x),
cos x,

00:22:51.741 --> 00:22:54.279
and sin x,
good for all x.

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.320
So, there's no restriction on
this.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.437
One of the really interesting
things to do when you are bored,

00:23:05.437 --> 00:23:08.242
or stranded somewhere in an
airport, is to take cosine

00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:11.383
squared plus sine squared.
Squared the whole thing,

00:23:11.383 --> 00:23:14.750
add the squared of the whole
thing and add them up.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.842
You'll find,
by miracle, you will get the

00:23:16.842 --> 00:23:19.877
one from squaring the one and
every other power of x

00:23:19.877 --> 00:23:22.447
will keep on vanishing.
Of course, you'll have to

00:23:22.447 --> 00:23:24.900
collect powers of x by
expanding the bracket.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.449
But it will all cancel.
That's what I meant by saying

00:23:27.449 --> 00:23:29.299
this series is as good as this
function.

00:23:29.299 --> 00:23:32.130
It will obey all the identities
known.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.539
Okay.
Now, for the punch line.

00:23:36.539 --> 00:23:39.596
I think everyone--Some of you
may know what the punch line is,

00:23:39.596 --> 00:23:41.299
the punch line is the
following.

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:45.188
Let us introduce,
without any preamble right now,

00:23:45.188 --> 00:23:49.077
the number i,
which is the squared root of

00:23:49.077 --> 00:23:52.148
minus 1.
All I expect of i is

00:23:52.148 --> 00:23:55.180
that when I squared it,
I get minus 1.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:59.304
If I cube it,
i^(3) is i^(2)

00:23:59.304 --> 00:24:03.630
times i,
so that's minus i,

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:07.607
and i to the 4th is back
to plus 1 because i to

00:24:07.607 --> 00:24:10.590
the 4th is i^(2) times
i^(2),

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.461
and i^(2) is minus 1.
So, if you take powers of

00:24:13.461 --> 00:24:15.789
i, it'll keep jumping
between these values.

00:24:15.789 --> 00:24:17.292
It'll be i,
it'll become minus 1,

00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:19.450
it'll become minus i,
then it'll become plus 1.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.599
That's the set of possible
values for powers of i.

00:24:22.599 --> 00:24:24.250
It'll be one of these four
values.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:29.052
Well.
Then we are told,

00:24:29.052 --> 00:24:36.437
if you now consider the
following rather strange object,

00:24:36.437 --> 00:24:40.019
e^(ix).
Now, e^(ix),

00:24:40.019 --> 00:24:42.619
you have to agree,
is really bizarre.

00:24:42.619 --> 00:24:45.557
e is some number,
you want to raise it to 2,

00:24:45.557 --> 00:24:47.839
that's fine.
Number times number.

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:50.440
i is a strange number,
right?

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.497
It's the squared root of minus
1, and you wanted me to raise

00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:58.259
e to a complex power.
What does that even mean?

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:01.410
Multiply e by itself
ix times?

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:03.880
Well, that definition of powers
is no good.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.878
But the series for e^(x)
defines it for all x,

00:25:08.878 --> 00:25:13.113
then we boldly define
e^(x) for even complex

00:25:13.113 --> 00:25:17.180
values of x as simply
this thing too,

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.670
with ix plugged in place
of x.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.240
And by that fashion,
we define exponential.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.372
So, the exponential function is
simply defined as,

00:25:27.372 --> 00:25:31.589
suppose you write e
raised to dog.

00:25:31.589 --> 00:25:35.958
e raised to dog
is 1 plus dog plus

00:25:35.958 --> 00:25:39.994
dog^(2) over 2.
e raised to anything is

00:25:39.994 --> 00:25:43.095
a code for this series.
And now we raise e to

00:25:43.095 --> 00:25:44.584
various things.
Real numbers,

00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:46.970
complex numbers,
matrices, whatever you want.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.956
Your pet, you can put that up.
Of course, you've got to be a

00:25:49.956 --> 00:25:51.514
little careful.
You cannot raise e

00:25:51.514 --> 00:25:53.559
raised to dog,
because the units don't match.

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:56.365
But there's a dog here
and dog^(2),

00:25:56.365 --> 00:25:59.346
so you should divide it by some
standard dog,

00:25:59.346 --> 00:26:01.450
like President's dog
[laughter].

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.113
Take some standard.
Napoleon's dog,

00:26:03.113 --> 00:26:04.923
divide it, then you've got
something dimensionless

00:26:04.923 --> 00:26:06.859
[laughter].
Then it will work.

00:26:06.859 --> 00:26:09.901
So, as long as it's some
dimensionless object,

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:13.279
this is what we mean by
e raised to that.

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:17.079
That's a fantastic leap of
imagination.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:20.070
How to raise e to
whatever power you like;

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:21.970
take the series.
Let's do the series.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:29.208
So, I'm going to get 1 plus
ix, plus (ix)^(2)

00:26:29.208 --> 00:26:33.097
over 2 factorial,
plus (ix)^(3) over 3

00:26:33.097 --> 00:26:36.190
factorial, and I'm going to stop
after this last term,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.730
(ix)^(4) over 4
factorial.

00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:41.920
Keep going, then what do you
get?

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.319
Let's take the 1 from here,
leave this alone for a minute.

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:50.788
You write i times
x, go here,

00:26:50.788 --> 00:26:54.999
i^(2) is minus 1,
so I get minus x^(2)

00:26:54.999 --> 00:26:58.220
over 2 factorial,
then I come here.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:01.469
I cubed is minus i,
so I write here,

00:27:01.469 --> 00:27:04.410
minus x^(3) over 3
factorial.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.102
Then, I go back here and write
x to the 4th over 4

00:27:07.102 --> 00:27:09.337
factorial.
By now, everybody knows what's

00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:12.238
going on.
Everybody knows that this is

00:27:12.238 --> 00:27:14.670
just cos x + i sin x.

00:27:19.299 --> 00:27:22.270
Okay, this is a super duper
formula.

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.867
Life cannot go on without this.
You want to draw a box around

00:27:26.867 --> 00:27:30.274
this one, draw it.
Because without this formula,

00:27:30.274 --> 00:27:32.610
we cannot do so many things we
do.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.693
It says that the trigonometric
functions and the exponential

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.920
functions are actually very
intimately connected.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.379
And if they're all defined by
the power series,

00:27:47.379 --> 00:27:50.322
you're able to prove it.
So, this is the formula proven

00:27:50.322 --> 00:27:53.029
by Euler.
And it's considered a very

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:56.903
beautiful formula,
and here is the particularly

00:27:56.903 --> 00:28:00.440
beautiful special case of this
formula.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:05.028
If you put x = π,
I get the result e^(iπ)

00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:08.388
equal the cos π,
which is minus 1,

00:28:08.388 --> 00:28:11.420
plus i sin π,
which is 0.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:17.259
I get the result e^(iπ)
+ 1 = 0.

00:28:17.259 --> 00:28:20.976
Now, everybody agrees this has
got to be one of the most

00:28:20.976 --> 00:28:24.828
beautiful formulas you can
imagine involving numbers or in

00:28:24.828 --> 00:28:28.200
mathematics.
Why is it such a great formula?

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:31.918
Look at this formula here.
π, defined from the

00:28:31.918 --> 00:28:34.731
Egyptian times,
is a ratio of circle to

00:28:34.731 --> 00:28:37.551
diameter.
i is square root to

00:28:37.551 --> 00:28:39.980
minus 1.
1 is the basis for all integers.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:42.200
e is the basis for the
logarithm.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.484
Here is a formula in which all
the key numbers appear in one

00:28:46.484 --> 00:28:50.058
single compact formula.
The fact that these numbers

00:28:50.058 --> 00:28:53.054
would have a relationship at all
is staggering,

00:28:53.054 --> 00:28:56.049
and this is the nature of the
relationship.

00:28:56.049 --> 00:29:00.557
This is voted the formula most
likely to be remembered,

00:29:00.557 --> 00:29:03.210
this formula.
Now, we are going to use not

00:29:03.210 --> 00:29:05.710
only the special case,
but we are going to use this

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:10.420
all the time.
So, how many people have seen

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.170
this?
Okay.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.930
If you have not seen this,
then you've got more work than

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.677
people who have seen this.
You've got to go and you've got

00:29:19.677 --> 00:29:22.500
to do all the intermediate steps
so you get used to this thing.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.380
Now, let's do the following two
other variations,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.210
and then I'll move on.
If I change x to minus

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:32.259
x, then I get
e^(-ix).

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:34.858
Cosine of minus x is
cosine x,

00:29:34.858 --> 00:29:37.880
and sin of minus x is
minus sin x.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.320
So, I can get that relation.

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:48.736
Then, I'm going to combine
those two to do the following:

00:29:48.736 --> 00:29:53.222
I'm going to say that cos
x = e^(ix) +

00:29:53.222 --> 00:29:57.369
e^(-ix) over 2,
you can check that.

00:29:57.369 --> 00:30:05.153
And sin x =
e^(ix) - e^(-ix)

00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:09.869
over 2i.
You just add and subtract these

00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:11.830
two formulas and you get that.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.039
Okay.
So, what does this mean?

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:26.730
It means that trigonometric
functions, you don't need them.

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.136
If you've got exponential
functions, you can manufacture

00:30:29.136 --> 00:30:30.799
trigonometric functions out of
them,

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:34.686
provided you're not afraid to
go to exponents with complex

00:30:34.686 --> 00:30:38.850
number i in them.
And all the identities about

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:42.349
sines and cosines will follow
from this.

00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:44.924
For example,
if you take cosine squared plus

00:30:44.924 --> 00:30:47.380
sine squared,
you're supposed to get 1.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:50.028
Well, you can square the right
hand side, you can square the

00:30:50.028 --> 00:30:51.690
left hand side,
and you will get 1.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.210
To get the 1,
you better remember the

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:58.130
following: e^(ix) times
e^(-ix) is what?

00:31:01.559 --> 00:31:03.319
You know how you come by an
exponent?

00:31:03.319 --> 00:31:07.659
You raise it to one power times
the same thing raised to another

00:31:07.659 --> 00:31:11.516
power, is e raised to ix minus
x, which is e raised to 0,

00:31:11.516 --> 00:31:14.460
which is 1.
So, when you raise the number

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.280
to a power, you multiply it by
the number times a different

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.430
power, the product is a number
to the sum of the two powers.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.907
Powers combine.
2 cubed times 2 to the 4th is 2

00:31:25.907 --> 00:31:28.200
to the 6th.
That's true for 2;

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.859
it's true for e;
it's true for everything.

00:31:29.859 --> 00:31:33.197
Exponents add when you multiply
them, that's why e^(ix)

00:31:33.197 --> 00:31:35.549
and e^(-ix) combine to
give you 1.

00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:37.990
Once you know that,
you can prove this.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:44.876
Okay.
Now, I'm going to do a little

00:31:44.876 --> 00:31:49.041
more of complex numbers,
so maybe I'll leave this alone

00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:51.742
for now.
I introduced you the number

00:31:51.742 --> 00:31:55.309
i by saying it's the
square root of minus 1,

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:59.839
and complex numbers entered our
life, even though we didn't go

00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:02.920
looking for them.
You can write down equations

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.202
with real numbers with no
intention of invoking anything

00:32:06.202 --> 00:32:08.938
fancy,
like this, and you find there

00:32:08.938 --> 00:32:12.918
is no solution to this equation.
Even though everything there is

00:32:12.918 --> 00:32:15.016
completely real.
So, you can say,

00:32:15.016 --> 00:32:19.597
"Well, x^(2) is minus
1," and you can manufacture a

00:32:19.597 --> 00:32:23.375
number i,
with a property i^(2) is

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:25.205
minus 1;
then, of course,

00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:28.199
you can have x equal to
plus and minus i as your

00:32:28.199 --> 00:32:30.339
answer.
So, complex numbers arose by

00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:32.519
trying to solve quadratic
equations.

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:37.977
So, let me write you a slightly
more interesting quadratic

00:32:37.977 --> 00:32:41.519
equation, x^(2) + x + 1 =
0.

00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:45.059
So, there's no funny business,
all real numbers.

00:32:45.059 --> 00:32:51.650
We want to solve this equation,
so we go back to our good old

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:58.461
sandbox days when we knew what
the answer for this was--minus 3

00:32:58.461 --> 00:33:01.024
over 2.
And we already have a problem

00:33:01.024 --> 00:33:03.920
because we don't know what to do
with square root of minus 3.

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:10.896
So, we will write it as square
root of minus 1 times square

00:33:10.896 --> 00:33:14.046
root of 3.
Square root of minus 1 we will

00:33:14.046 --> 00:33:16.492
call i,
and we will say this equation

00:33:16.492 --> 00:33:20.271
has two roots.
x plus/minus (there are

00:33:20.271 --> 00:33:25.705
) two roots, which are minus 1
plus or minus square root of

00:33:25.705 --> 00:33:31.229
3i over 2.
So, one root is 1 minus 1,

00:33:31.229 --> 00:33:37.785
plus root 3i over 2.
And the other root is minus 1

00:33:37.785 --> 00:33:43.833
minus root 3i over 2.
These are solutions formerly to

00:33:43.833 --> 00:33:48.029
this equation in the following
sense.

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:49.759
Take this x that I'm
giving you;

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:53.216
put that into that equation,
square the x and add the

00:33:53.216 --> 00:33:54.915
x to it,
and add the 1,

00:33:54.915 --> 00:33:57.200
it'll in fact satisfy the
equation.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.228
All you will have to know when
you manipulate it is that

00:34:00.228 --> 00:34:02.997
i^(2) is minus 1.
Using the one property,

00:34:02.997 --> 00:34:05.440
you can now solve the quadratic
equation.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.818
So, people realize if you
enlarge numbers to include

00:34:08.818 --> 00:34:11.336
complex numbers,
then you can solve any

00:34:11.336 --> 00:34:14.980
polynomial equation with that
many number of roots.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:16.609
If it's quadratic,
it'll have two roots,

00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:18.280
if it's cubic,
it'll have three roots.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.646
They may not all be real;
they may involve the complex

00:34:21.646 --> 00:34:25.513
number i.
Now, a very important point to

00:34:25.513 --> 00:34:30.889
notice is that this whole thing,
minus 1 plus root 3i

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:35.809
over 2, the whole thing is a
single complex number.

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:37.280
Don't think of it as the sum of
two numbers;

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.884
it's a single complex number.
For example,

00:34:39.884 --> 00:34:44.787
if this had been plus instead
of minus, you'd get something

00:34:44.787 --> 00:34:48.000
like 1 plus or minus root 3 over
2.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.817
Take the positive root,
you don't think of it as two

00:34:50.817 --> 00:34:52.980
numbers.
This is a single number.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.760
And that continues to be true
even if it's a complex number.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.904
So, you should think of the
whole combination as a single

00:35:00.904 --> 00:35:05.123
entity which you can add to
others as entities and square,

00:35:05.123 --> 00:35:07.070
and so on.
Okay.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.960
So, that's what we are going to
do now.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.030
We're going to generalize this
particular case and introduce

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.431
now a complex number z.
And we're going to write every

00:35:18.431 --> 00:35:21.733
complex number z as a
part that has no i in it,

00:35:21.733 --> 00:35:23.989
and a part that has an i
in it.

00:35:23.989 --> 00:35:29.327
The example I had here,
x is equal to--in this

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:35.486
example, x was minus 1
over 2 and y was plus or

00:35:35.486 --> 00:35:39.471
minus root 3 over 2.
And we're going to visualize

00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.460
that complex number as a point
in the xy plane.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.131
We just measure x
horizontally and y

00:35:45.131 --> 00:35:48.131
vertically, put a dot there,
that's your complex number,

00:35:48.131 --> 00:35:48.840
z.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.128
Then, we say the new complex
number called z star [*]

00:35:58.128 --> 00:36:02.399
and it's defined to be x -
iy, is called the complex

00:36:02.399 --> 00:36:03.430
conjugate;

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.494
complex conjugate of z.
It's obtained by changing the

00:36:11.494 --> 00:36:13.484
sign of i.
So, if you like,

00:36:13.484 --> 00:36:16.486
if z is sitting here,
z star is sitting there,

00:36:16.486 --> 00:36:18.420
reflected around the x
axis.

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:31.130
So, how does one work with
complex numbers?

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.977
You add them,
you subtract them,

00:36:32.977 --> 00:36:35.659
and you multiply them,
and you divide them.

00:36:35.659 --> 00:36:38.290
If you know how to do that,
you can do with complex numbers

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:40.059
everything you did with real
numbers.

00:36:40.059 --> 00:36:44.120
So if z_1 is a
complex number that is equal to

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.739
x_1 +
iy_1,

00:36:46.739 --> 00:36:49.461
and z_2 is a
complex number that is

00:36:49.461 --> 00:36:51.969
x_2 +
iy_2,

00:36:51.969 --> 00:36:55.187
we will define
z_1 +

00:36:55.187 --> 00:36:59.477
z_2 to be
x_1 +

00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:03.052
x_2 times
i times

00:37:03.052 --> 00:37:07.789
y_1 plus
y_2.

00:37:07.789 --> 00:37:11.217
If you draw pictures,
then if z_1 is

00:37:11.217 --> 00:37:14.052
that number and
z_2 is that

00:37:14.052 --> 00:37:17.235
number [pointing to the board],
then z_1 +

00:37:17.235 --> 00:37:19.019
z_2 it really
is like adding vectors.

00:37:19.019 --> 00:37:22.880
This number is z_1
+ z_2.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.269
It's exactly like adding
vectors.

00:37:25.269 --> 00:37:30.597
But you don't think of this
plus that as two disjoined

00:37:30.597 --> 00:37:34.820
numbers, but as forming a single
entity.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:41.171
In a complex number z,
x is called a real part

00:37:41.171 --> 00:37:47.199
of z, and is denoted by
symbol "real z."

00:37:47.199 --> 00:37:50.176
If you want to get z,
if you want to get the real

00:37:50.176 --> 00:37:53.206
part of a complex number
z, you add to its complex

00:37:53.206 --> 00:37:56.830
conjugate and divide by 2.
Because you are adding x +

00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:00.209
iy to x - iy,
you get 2x and you

00:38:00.209 --> 00:38:04.172
divide by 2, you get that.
If you want to get the

00:38:04.172 --> 00:38:09.167
y, which is called the
imaginary part of z,

00:38:09.167 --> 00:38:13.360
you take z - z star and divide
by 2i.

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:19.010
It's like saying find the
x component of a vector.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.440
It's whatever multiplies
i.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.690
y component of a vector
is whatever multiplies j.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:25.549
Similarly, a complex number can
be broken down into the part

00:38:25.549 --> 00:38:28.360
which is real and the part that
multiplies the i.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.852
To extract the real part,
add to it the conjugate divided

00:38:30.852 --> 00:38:33.611
by 2, to extract the imaginary
part, subtract the conjugate and

00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:37.574
divide by 2i.
Again, if you have seen this,

00:38:37.574 --> 00:38:40.654
you don't need this.
If you haven't seen it,

00:38:40.654 --> 00:38:43.903
it may look a little fast.
But that's why I posted all the

00:38:43.903 --> 00:38:47.348
notes on the website,
chapter 5 from this math book,

00:38:47.348 --> 00:38:51.222
which has got all this stuff.
So, you can go home and you can

00:38:51.222 --> 00:38:54.877
read it.
Ok, the next question is what

00:38:54.877 --> 00:39:00.539
is z_1 times
z_2?

00:39:00.539 --> 00:39:03.780
Well, that's very easy to
calculate.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:06.602
x_1 +
iy_1 times

00:39:06.602 --> 00:39:09.760
x_2 +
iy_2.

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.881
Just open all the brackets and
remember i^(2) is minus

00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:14.530
1.
That's all you've got to do.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.819
So, that gives me
x_1x

00:39:15.819 --> 00:39:17.827
_2;
then, let me multiply the

00:39:17.827 --> 00:39:20.659
iy_1 times the
iy_2.

00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:23.253
And that gives me minus
y_1y

00:39:23.253 --> 00:39:26.365
_2,
because i^(2) is minus 1

00:39:26.365 --> 00:39:28.699
plus i times
x_1y

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.969
_2 +
x_2y

00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:33.971
_1.
This is how you multiply two

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:34.810
complex numbers.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.023
That's something very nice that
happens when you multiply a

00:39:43.023 --> 00:39:45.679
number z by its complex
conjugate.

00:39:45.679 --> 00:39:49.675
What happens when you multiply
z by its conjugate,

00:39:49.675 --> 00:39:52.100
you are saying,
take x + iy,

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:55.239
multiply it by x minus
iy;

00:39:55.239 --> 00:39:59.039
a + b times a - b =
a^(2) - b^(2).

00:39:59.039 --> 00:40:01.460
But remember,
b is iy.

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:05.220
So, when you take the square of
that, you should keep track of

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.920
all the signs and you will find
it's x^(2) + y^(2).

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:15.278
We denote that as this,
and this thing is called the

00:40:15.278 --> 00:40:19.830
modulus of z [|z|].
It's the length of the complex

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.280
number z,
just given by Pythagoras'

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:21.670
theorem.

00:40:30.789 --> 00:40:32.945
You should know,
whenever you take a complex

00:40:32.945 --> 00:40:34.800
number, multiply by each
conjugate,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.695
by its complex conjugate,
the result will be a real

00:40:37.695 --> 00:40:40.822
number equal to the square of
the length of the complex

00:40:40.822 --> 00:40:43.473
number.
Because I'm going to use that

00:40:43.473 --> 00:40:46.181
now to do the last of the
manipulations,

00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:49.514
which is, what is
z_1 divided by

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.151
z_2?
How do you divide these crazy

00:40:53.151 --> 00:40:55.254
numbers?
So, on the top I write

00:40:55.254 --> 00:40:57.835
x_1 +
iy_1,

00:40:57.835 --> 00:41:00.416
the bottom, I write
x_2 +

00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:02.974
iy_2.
If I only had

00:41:02.974 --> 00:41:05.970
x_2,
I know how to divide.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:07.661
It's just a number.
Divide that by

00:41:07.661 --> 00:41:09.239
x_2 and that by
x_2.

00:41:09.239 --> 00:41:11.237
But I've got the sum of these
two numbers in the bottom,

00:41:11.237 --> 00:41:12.980
and you can ask,
"How do you do the division?"

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:15.980
So, the trick,
always, when you run into this

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.800
problem, is to multiply the top
and bottom by the complex

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.044
conjugate of the bottom.
Multiply it by x_2

00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:24.680
- iy_2,
top and bottom.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:30.920
Then, something nice happens to
the denominator,

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.771
because the denominator then
becomes x_2^(2) +

00:41:33.771 --> 00:41:36.566
y_2^(2),
which is an ordinary real

00:41:36.566 --> 00:41:38.750
number, nothing complex about
that.

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:40.889
The numerator,
you can open out the brackets.

00:41:40.889 --> 00:41:42.159
I don't know if I want to do
that;

00:41:42.159 --> 00:41:47.011
it's just going to be
x_1x_2 +

00:41:47.011 --> 00:41:52.328
y_1y_2 +
i times y_1x

00:41:52.328 --> 00:41:55.594
_2 -
y_2x

00:41:55.594 --> 00:41:59.101
_1.
Now, don't worry about all the

00:41:59.101 --> 00:42:00.329
details.
All it means is,

00:42:00.329 --> 00:42:02.737
if you know how to multiply two
complex numbers,

00:42:02.737 --> 00:42:04.940
you can also divide by a
complex number.

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.309
That's the key point.
Why?

00:42:07.309 --> 00:42:09.506
Because if you've got a complex
number denominator,

00:42:09.506 --> 00:42:11.616
you don't like it,
multiply top and bottom by the

00:42:11.616 --> 00:42:15.005
complex conjugate of this guy,
the denominator turns into a

00:42:15.005 --> 00:42:18.465
purely real number.
So, this whole thing could be

00:42:18.465 --> 00:42:21.385
36, for example.
Well, we know how to divide the

00:42:21.385 --> 00:42:22.690
numerator by 36,
right?

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.970
x_1x_2 +
y_1y_2

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.310
some number, maybe 9;
then you divide by 36.

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:30.440
One-fourth.
This could be i times 18.

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.260
It would be 36,
you get i over 2.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:37.489
So, this number could have been
one fourth plus i over 2.

00:42:37.489 --> 00:42:39.400
So, dividing by a complex
number is not a problem.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:50.590
Now, why did I do all that
stuff today about e^(ix)?

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:54.693
You're going to see that now.
The rationale for going through

00:42:54.693 --> 00:42:59.640
that math is the following.
Let's take this complex number

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:04.719
that goes from here to here,
that is x + iy.

00:43:04.719 --> 00:43:08.307
And let's introduce,
just like we would for an

00:43:08.307 --> 00:43:11.895
ordinary vector,
this angle θ and that

00:43:11.895 --> 00:43:15.098
length r.
Whenever you have a vector,

00:43:15.098 --> 00:43:18.136
you can talk about the
Cartesian components x

00:43:18.136 --> 00:43:20.186
and y,
or you can talk about the

00:43:20.186 --> 00:43:22.159
length of the vector and the
angle it makes.

00:43:22.159 --> 00:43:26.668
Then, it's clear that x = r
cos θ, and y = r sin

00:43:26.668 --> 00:43:31.020
θ, where θ is now
an angle associated with a

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:35.840
complex number which tells you
at what angle it's located,

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.840
and r is the length of
the complex number.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.940
It's called the polar form of
the complex number.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.356
Then, you can see that
z, which is x +

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:50.807
iy, is equal to r
times cos θ + i sin θ

00:43:50.807 --> 00:43:56.539
which you can now write as
r times e^(iθ).

00:43:56.539 --> 00:44:00.068
That's why we did all that
work, to tell you that a complex

00:44:00.068 --> 00:44:02.320
number can be written in this
form.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:06.065
You can either write this x
+ iy, or else

00:44:06.065 --> 00:44:09.044
re^(iθ).
They both talk about the same

00:44:09.044 --> 00:44:10.920
number.
One talks about how much real

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.070
part and how much imaginary part
it has, other way of writing it

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:15.970
talks about how long the vector
is,

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:19.329
and at what angle it is located.
It contains the same

00:44:19.329 --> 00:44:21.904
information.
So, that r is equal to--

00:44:21.904 --> 00:44:25.514
the inverse of this formula is
that r is square root of

00:44:25.514 --> 00:44:28.000
x squared plus y
squared,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.139
and θ is tan
inverse y over x.

00:44:33.139 --> 00:44:35.012
In other words,
tan θ is y over

00:44:35.012 --> 00:44:36.542
x.
This is y,

00:44:36.542 --> 00:44:37.930
and this is x.

00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:46.403
Now, the advantage of writing a
complex number in polar form is

00:44:46.403 --> 00:44:49.065
the following.
Suppose I give you two complex

00:44:49.065 --> 00:44:51.621
numbers, z_1 is
r_1e

00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:54.864
^(iθ)_1,
and z_2 is

00:44:54.864 --> 00:44:56.510
r_2
e^(iθ

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.017
)_2.
The product z_1z

00:44:59.017 --> 00:45:02.325
_2 is very easy to
calculate in this form because

00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:04.726
r_1r
_2 multiply to

00:45:04.726 --> 00:45:08.800
give you this,
and the exponentials combine.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:13.701
It's a lot easier to multiply
them in this form than when I

00:45:13.701 --> 00:45:17.525
multiplied them somewhere here.
See, if I write it in this

00:45:17.525 --> 00:45:18.840
Cartesian form,
it's a big mess.

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.748
In polar form, it's very easy.
So, the rule is,

00:45:21.748 --> 00:45:25.171
if you want to multiply two
numbers, multiply the lengths to

00:45:25.171 --> 00:45:28.711
get the length of the new number
and add the angles to get the

00:45:28.711 --> 00:45:32.040
angle of the product.
So, what I'm telling you is

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.884
that if z_1
looks like this guy with some

00:45:35.884 --> 00:45:38.651
angle θ 1,
and z_2 is

00:45:38.651 --> 00:45:41.805
that guy with an angle θ
2, the number z_1z

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:44.708
_2 has a length
equal to the product of these

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:47.168
two lengths,
and that angle equal the sum of

00:45:47.168 --> 00:45:49.347
these two angles,
so it will look like that

00:45:49.347 --> 00:45:52.433
[writing graph on board].
To go from this to that,

00:45:52.433 --> 00:45:55.769
you multiply the lengths and
you add the angles.

00:45:55.769 --> 00:45:59.939
So, the polar form is very well
suited for multiplying,

00:45:59.939 --> 00:46:03.260
and it's even better suited for
dividing.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.446
If I say, "Give me
z_1 over

00:46:05.446 --> 00:46:08.242
z_2," well,
you can all do that in your

00:46:08.242 --> 00:46:09.839
head.
It's r_1,

00:46:09.839 --> 00:46:11.329
e^(iθ
)_1,

00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:12.687
divided by
r_2,

00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:14.440
e^(iθ
)_2.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:17.558
The modulus of the new number
is just r_1

00:46:17.558 --> 00:46:20.280
over r_2.
And how about this?

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.822
e^(iθ
)_1 divided by

00:46:21.822 --> 00:46:23.119
e^(iθ
)_2.

00:46:23.119 --> 00:46:25.500
Dividing by
e^(iθ) is the

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.429
same as multiplying by
e^(-iθ).

00:46:28.429 --> 00:46:31.510
So, this is really
e^(iθ

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:37.343
)_1 - θ 2.
So, I'm assuming you guys can

00:46:37.343 --> 00:46:42.281
figure this part out,
1 over e^(iθ) is

00:46:42.281 --> 00:46:45.889
the same as
e^(-iθ).

00:46:45.889 --> 00:46:49.114
Well, if you doubt me,
multiply--cross multiply,

00:46:49.114 --> 00:46:53.367
and all I'm telling you is that
1 = e^(iθ) times

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:56.776
e^(-iθ),
which you know is true when you

00:46:56.776 --> 00:46:58.565
combine the angles.
When you've got

00:46:58.565 --> 00:47:01.077
e^(iθ)
downstairs, you can take it

00:47:01.077 --> 00:47:04.829
upstairs with the reverse angle.
And that's a useful trick;

00:47:04.829 --> 00:47:06.490
I hope you will remember that
useful trick.

00:47:09.659 --> 00:47:12.647
So, there is one part of this
thing that I want you to carry

00:47:12.647 --> 00:47:14.217
in your head,
because it's very,

00:47:14.217 --> 00:47:17.850
very important.
When you take a complex number,

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:21.639
it's got a length and it's got
a direction.

00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.039
Then, you multiply by a second
complex number,

00:47:24.039 --> 00:47:26.599
you're able to do two things at
the same time.

00:47:26.599 --> 00:47:29.860
You're able to rescale it,
and you're able to rotate it.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:32.523
You rescale by the length of
the second factor,

00:47:32.523 --> 00:47:35.940
and you rotate by the angle
carried by the second factor.

00:47:40.269 --> 00:47:43.640
The fact that two operations
are done in one shot is the

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:47.194
reason complex numbers play an
incredibly important role in

00:47:47.194 --> 00:47:49.293
physics,
and certainly in engineering

00:47:49.293 --> 00:47:50.560
and mathematical physics.

00:47:59.079 --> 00:48:04.558
I'm going to now change gears,
but I want to stop a little bit

00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:08.420
and answer any questions any of
you have.

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.300
So, how many people have seen
all of this before?

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.539
So, if you saw something,
you saw the whole thing.

00:48:14.539 --> 00:48:18.126
But look, that's not such a big
number, so I am cognizant of the

00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:20.460
fact that not many of you have
seen it.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.570
But you will have to go and
learn this today.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:28.591
I'm going to post the problem
set for this sometime in the day

00:48:28.591 --> 00:48:32.414
so you can start practicing.
Don't wait, the problem set has

00:48:32.414 --> 00:48:35.507
nothing to do with next
Wednesday, it has a lot to do

00:48:35.507 --> 00:48:38.080
with today.
When I assign a problem today,

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.866
I imagine you're going
breathlessly to your room,

00:48:40.866 --> 00:48:43.477
not able to wait,
jumping into the problem set

00:48:43.477 --> 00:48:46.081
and working it out.
That's the only way you're

00:48:46.081 --> 00:48:48.877
going to find out what these
things mean if you've never seen

00:48:48.877 --> 00:48:50.800
them.
If you've seen them before in

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.847
high school, or taken a math
course and you've got lots of

00:48:53.847 --> 00:48:56.039
practice, then I'm not talking
to you.

00:48:56.039 --> 00:48:58.696
But I'm going to use this at
some point, so you should

00:48:58.696 --> 00:49:01.262
understand complex numbers.
And I'm telling you,

00:49:01.262 --> 00:49:04.322
there are very few branches of
any science where complex

00:49:04.322 --> 00:49:08.188
numbers will not be used.
Now, you may not believe this

00:49:08.188 --> 00:49:11.606
now, but that is true.
If an electrical engineer,

00:49:11.606 --> 00:49:14.487
it's an absolute must.
If you solve any kind of

00:49:14.487 --> 00:49:18.303
differential equation which can
occur in biology and chemistry,

00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:22.670
that's a must.
So, it's very, very important.

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:26.982
All right.
So now, I'm going back to

00:49:26.982 --> 00:49:29.651
physics.
Going back from mathematics to

00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:33.787
physics, and the physics of this
topic for today has to do with

00:49:33.787 --> 00:49:36.590
something very different from
the past,

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:38.559
so forget all the relativity
now.

00:49:38.559 --> 00:49:41.579
You're going back to Newtonian
days.

00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:43.769
Kinetic energy is ½
mv^(2).

00:49:43.769 --> 00:49:47.143
It's a little difficult to go
back and forget what you

00:49:47.143 --> 00:49:48.479
learned.
On the other hand,

00:49:48.479 --> 00:49:50.188
for some of you,
it may not be so hard if you

00:49:50.188 --> 00:49:52.707
didn't learn anything.
Well then, you are that much

00:49:52.707 --> 00:49:55.443
ahead of the other guys.
But remember now,

00:49:55.443 --> 00:49:58.469
the truth is the relativistic
theory.

00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:00.769
We're going to go back to
Newtonian days,

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:03.989
and the reason we do it that
way is to give you something

00:50:03.989 --> 00:50:07.284
interesting,
hopefully, compared to what you

00:50:07.284 --> 00:50:10.686
normally do.
So, what we're going to study

00:50:10.686 --> 00:50:13.923
now is what's called small
oscillations,

00:50:13.923 --> 00:50:17.677
or simple harmonic motion.
It's a ubiquitous fact,

00:50:17.677 --> 00:50:21.193
that if you took any mechanical
system which is in a state of

00:50:21.193 --> 00:50:24.650
equilibrium, and you give it a
little kick, it vibrates.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:27.530
Now, if you've got a pillar,
ceiling to floor,

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.090
you hit it with a hammer,
it vibrates.

00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:34.070
If you take a gong and hit it,
it also vibrates.

00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:38.554
If you've got a rod hanging
form the ceiling through a pivot

00:50:38.554 --> 00:50:43.570
-- it's hanging there -- if you
pull it, it goes back and forth.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:47.940
The standard example everyone
likes to use is if you've got a

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.508
particle in a bowl,
it's very happy sitting in the

00:50:51.508 --> 00:50:54.729
bottom.
If you push it up a little bit,

00:50:54.729 --> 00:50:58.164
it'll go back and forth.
And the example that we're

00:50:58.164 --> 00:51:00.219
going to consider is the
following.

00:51:00.219 --> 00:51:03.129
If you have a mass,
m, connected to a

00:51:03.129 --> 00:51:06.715
spring, and the spring is not
stretched or contracted,

00:51:06.715 --> 00:51:09.954
it's very happy to be there.
That's what I mean by

00:51:09.954 --> 00:51:12.321
equilibrium.
Equilibrium means the body has

00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:14.420
all the forces on it adding up
to 0;

00:51:14.420 --> 00:51:16.894
it has no desire to move.
The question is,

00:51:16.894 --> 00:51:19.150
if you give it a little kick,
what'll happen?

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.969
Well, there are two situations
you can have.

00:51:21.969 --> 00:51:24.719
You can have a situation where
the particle's on top of a hill.

00:51:24.719 --> 00:51:27.804
That's called unstable
equilibrium because if you give

00:51:27.804 --> 00:51:31.469
that a kick, it's going to come
down and never return to you.

00:51:31.469 --> 00:51:34.159
That's equilibrium,
but unstable equilibrium.

00:51:34.159 --> 00:51:35.489
I'm talking about stable
equilibrium.

00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:38.090
That's because there are
restoring forces.

00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.441
If you stray away from the
equilibrium, there are forces

00:51:41.441 --> 00:51:44.873
bringing you back.
And in the case of the mass and

00:51:44.873 --> 00:51:47.730
spring system,
the force, md 2..

00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:49.989
ma, is equal to
-kx.

00:51:49.989 --> 00:51:52.587
And what this equation tells
you is if you stray to the

00:51:52.587 --> 00:51:55.755
right, x is positive,
[I will apply a force to the

00:51:55.755 --> 00:51:57.850
left.]
Remember, this is ma,

00:51:57.850 --> 00:52:01.307
and this is F.
F is such that it always

00:52:01.307 --> 00:52:03.860
sends you back to your normal
position.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:13.720
So, we want to understand the
behavior of such a problem.

00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:18.500
We want to solve this problem.
How do you solve this problem?

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:21.762
Well, I did it for you along
back, when I gave you a typical

00:52:21.762 --> 00:52:24.140
paradigm for how you apply
Newton's laws;

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.223
I gave you this example.
So, I'm going to go through it

00:52:27.223 --> 00:52:29.930
somewhat fast.
Our job is to find the function

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.409
x that satisfies this
equation.

00:52:32.409 --> 00:52:36.734
And we would like to write it
as follows: d^(2)x over

00:52:36.734 --> 00:52:40.400
dt^(2) is equal to minus
Ω^(2) x,

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.641
where Ω is the
shorthand for squared root of

00:52:44.641 --> 00:52:48.265
k over m.
By the way, I'm using big

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:51.788
X and small x like
crazy, so it's just small

00:52:51.788 --> 00:52:54.105
x.
I don't mean anything

00:52:54.105 --> 00:52:56.730
significant between this and
this.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:59.298
They're all the same.
If you want,

00:52:59.298 --> 00:53:03.776
you can take this--pardon me?
[inaudible question]

00:53:03.776 --> 00:53:07.639
This is k,
and this guy is k.

00:53:07.639 --> 00:53:11.812
And the other equations you use
to follow the lecture today is,

00:53:11.812 --> 00:53:14.370
[x=X]
these are all the same.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.063
Okay?
So, don't say what happened

00:53:17.063 --> 00:53:19.219
there, when you move from one to
the other.

00:53:19.219 --> 00:53:21.570
Alright, so what did I say we
should do?

00:53:21.570 --> 00:53:25.034
You can make it a word problem
and say, "I'm looking for a

00:53:25.034 --> 00:53:27.829
function which,
when I take two derivatives,

00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:32.430
looks like minus itself,
except for this number."

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.804
And we just saw that today.
Trigonometric functions have

00:53:35.804 --> 00:53:38.480
the property that you take two
derivatives, they return to

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.550
minus themselves.
So, you can take a guess that

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.223
x looks like cos t
but it won't work,

00:53:45.223 --> 00:53:48.469
that I showed you before.
So, I'm not going to go through

00:53:48.469 --> 00:53:50.792
that again.
If you took this guess--but

00:53:50.792 --> 00:53:54.587
x is not a number,
x is a function of time

00:53:54.587 --> 00:53:57.528
[x(t)].
If you took this function of

00:53:57.528 --> 00:54:00.181
time, it, in fact,
will obey this equation,

00:54:00.181 --> 00:54:04.033
provided the Ω that you
put in is the Ω that's

00:54:04.033 --> 00:54:08.290
in the equation.
Why?

00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:12.078
Because, take two derivatives.
First time you get -Ω,

00:54:12.078 --> 00:54:14.695
sin Ω.
The second time you get -

00:54:14.695 --> 00:54:17.014
Ω ^(2) cos Ωt,
which means it's minus

00:54:17.014 --> 00:54:20.261
Ω ^(2),
times your x itself,

00:54:20.261 --> 00:54:22.550
and it is whatever you like.

00:54:25.579 --> 00:54:28.300
Then I said,
"Let's plot this guy."

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.160
When you plot this guy it looks
like this.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.940
And A is the amplitude.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:43.535
What is Ω?
Well, Ω is related to

00:54:43.535 --> 00:54:47.150
the time of the frequency of
oscillations as follows:

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:51.389
If I start with t = 0
over the x = A,

00:54:51.389 --> 00:54:54.719
how long do I have to wait
'till I come back to A?

00:54:54.719 --> 00:54:58.286
I think everybody should know
that I have to wait at time

00:54:58.286 --> 00:55:01.534
capital T so that
Ω times T is

00:55:01.534 --> 00:55:03.969
2π.
Because that's when the cosine

00:55:03.969 --> 00:55:06.746
returns to 1.
That means the time that you

00:55:06.746 --> 00:55:09.949
have to wait is 2π over
Ω.

00:55:09.949 --> 00:55:13.228
Or you can say Ω is
2π over T,

00:55:13.228 --> 00:55:16.760
or you can also write it a
2π times frequency,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.593
where frequency is what you and
I would call frequency,

00:55:19.593 --> 00:55:21.849
how many oscillations it does
per second.

00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:24.449
That's the inverse of the time
period.

00:55:24.449 --> 00:55:30.842
So, if you pull a mass and you
let it go, it oscillates with a

00:55:30.842 --> 00:55:37.760
frequency which is connected to
the force constant and the mass.

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:40.022
If the spring is very stiff and
k is very large,

00:55:40.022 --> 00:55:42.860
frequency is very high.
If the mass is very big and the

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.690
motion is very sluggish,
f is diminished.

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.860
So, all that stuff comes out of
the equation.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.386
One really remarkable part of
the equation is that you can

00:55:52.386 --> 00:55:56.660
pick any A you like.
Think about what that means.

00:55:56.660 --> 00:55:59.664
What is the meaning of A?
A is the amount by which

00:55:59.664 --> 00:56:01.139
you pulled it when you let it
go.

00:56:01.139 --> 00:56:05.299
You are told whether you pull
the spring by one inch or by ten

00:56:05.299 --> 00:56:09.118
inches, the time it takes to
finish a full back and forth

00:56:09.118 --> 00:56:11.710
motion is independent of
A.

00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:15.210
This frequency here is
independent of A.

00:56:15.210 --> 00:56:16.848
Yes?
Student:

00:56:16.848 --> 00:56:18.693
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:56:18.693 --> 00:56:23.150
Shankar: This t here?
Here?

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:23.619
Student:
[inaudible]

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:24.306
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Ah,

00:56:24.306 --> 00:56:25.140
very good.
That's correct.

00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.773
So, let's be careful.
This is the t axis

00:56:26.773 --> 00:56:29.242
[pointing at graph on board];
this is a particular time,

00:56:29.242 --> 00:56:30.400
capital T.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:39.442
So, the remarkable property of
simple harmonic motion is that

00:56:39.442 --> 00:56:42.309
the amplitude does not determine
the time period.

00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:44.777
If you pull it by two inches,
compared to one inch,

00:56:44.777 --> 00:56:47.929
it's got a long way to go.
But because you pulled it by

00:56:47.929 --> 00:56:51.719
two inches, the spring is going
to be that much more tense,

00:56:51.719 --> 00:56:54.439
and it's going to exert a
bigger force so that it'll go

00:56:54.439 --> 00:56:57.750
faster for most of the time,
that's very clear.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:00.742
But the fact that it goes
faster in exactly the right way

00:57:00.742 --> 00:57:02.880
to complete the trip at the same
time,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:06.824
is rather a miraculous property
of the fact that this equation

00:57:06.824 --> 00:57:10.242
has this particular form.
If you tamper with this,

00:57:10.242 --> 00:57:13.934
if you add to this a little
bit, like 1 over 100 times

00:57:13.934 --> 00:57:17.070
x^(3),
then all these bets are off.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:21.310
It's got to be that equation
for that result to be true.

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.977
Okay.
So, this is simple harmonic

00:57:23.977 --> 00:57:26.278
motion.
Then, you can do the following

00:57:26.278 --> 00:57:29.519
variant of this solution,
which I will write down now.

00:57:29.519 --> 00:57:36.019
Suppose I set my clock to 0,
right there.

00:57:36.019 --> 00:57:38.370
You set your clock to 0 here,
but I can say,

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:40.609
"You know what?
I just got up and I'm looking

00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:42.190
at the mass, I set my clock to
0."

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:44.369
When it hits 0,
it's not at the maximum.

00:57:44.369 --> 00:57:47.650
But it's the same physics,
it's the same equation.

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:51.311
And that really comes from the
fact that we had one more

00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:54.840
latitude here of adding a
certain number φ,

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.530
which is called a "phase," to
the oscillator.

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:03.599
Whatever you pick for
φ, it'll still work.

00:58:03.599 --> 00:58:05.286
And whatever you pick for
capital A,

00:58:05.286 --> 00:58:07.400
it'll still work.
So, whenever you have an

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.876
oscillator, namely,
a mass and spring system,

00:58:09.876 --> 00:58:12.971
and you want to know what
x is going to be at all

00:58:12.971 --> 00:58:16.114
times,
you need to somehow determine

00:58:16.114 --> 00:58:19.833
the amplitude and the phase.
Once you know that,

00:58:19.833 --> 00:58:22.850
you can calculate x at
all future times.

00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:28.828
So, let me give you an example.
Suppose an oscillator has

00:58:28.828 --> 00:58:35.910
x = 5 and velocity equal
to 0, at t equal to 0.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:39.554
So what does that mean?
I pulled it by 5 and I let it

00:58:39.554 --> 00:58:41.547
go.
I tell you the spring constant

00:58:41.547 --> 00:58:43.865
k and I tell you the
mass, and I say,

00:58:43.865 --> 00:58:46.898
"What's the future x?"
You've got to come back to this

00:58:46.898 --> 00:58:50.425
equation.
And you've got to say,

00:58:50.425 --> 00:58:55.790
5 = A cosine of 0 +
φ.

00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:59.230
And how about the velocity?
Velocity is supposed to be 0;

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:05.140
that is minus ΩA sin
Ωt + φ.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:09.170
But t is 0.
So, that tells me 0 is minus

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:12.500
Ω a sin φ.
Ω is not 0,

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:16.266
A is not 0.
Therefore sin φ is 0,

00:59:16.266 --> 00:59:20.596
that means φ is 0 if
you get rid of that,

00:59:20.596 --> 00:59:25.920
so the subsequent motion is
x = 5 cos Ωt.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.440
This is a problem where we did
not need φ.

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:32.244
But it could have been that
when you joined the experiment,

00:59:32.244 --> 00:59:35.081
you were somewhere here;
then, the mass is actually

00:59:35.081 --> 00:59:36.975
moving.
Then I will say at t =

00:59:36.975 --> 00:59:38.840
0, velocity was some other
number.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.311
Maybe 6.
Then, you've got to go back and

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.297
write two equations.
One for x:

00:59:43.297 --> 00:59:47.044
take the derivative which looks
like this, and instead of

00:59:47.044 --> 00:59:50.034
putting 0, you put 6.
You've got two unknowns,

00:59:50.034 --> 00:59:52.481
A and φ.
You've got to juggle them

00:59:52.481 --> 00:59:54.943
around, and you've got to solve
for A and φ,

00:59:54.943 --> 00:59:57.982
given these two numbers.
It's a simple exercise to solve

00:59:57.982 --> 01:00:01.218
for them, and when you do,
you have completely fit the

01:00:01.218 --> 01:00:02.739
problem.
In other words,

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:05.966
simply to be told a mass is
connected to a spring of known

01:00:05.966 --> 01:00:09.364
mass and force constant is not
enough to determine the future

01:00:09.364 --> 01:00:11.926
of the spring.
You have to be told--For

01:00:11.926 --> 01:00:15.457
example, if nobody pulled the
mass, it's just going to sit

01:00:15.457 --> 01:00:17.572
there forever.
If you pulled it by 10,

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.019
it's going to go back and forth
from 10 to minus 10.

01:00:20.019 --> 01:00:23.915
So, you have to be told further
information to nail down these

01:00:23.915 --> 01:00:26.354
two numbers.
They're called free parameters

01:00:26.354 --> 01:00:28.272
in the solution.
On the other hand,

01:00:28.272 --> 01:00:31.515
no matter how much you pulled
it and how you released it,

01:00:31.515 --> 01:00:34.005
this Ω,
and therefore the frequency,

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.039
are not variable.
Yes?

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:37.860
Student:
[inaudible]

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:41.570
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: If you start it at

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.735
rest,
indeed, it will be 0,

01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:47.758
because the velocity at
t = 0 is minus ΩA sin

01:00:47.758 --> 01:00:49.561
φ.
If you want to kill that,

01:00:49.561 --> 01:00:52.361
the only way is φ = 0.
You could put φ = π if

01:00:52.361 --> 01:00:54.260
you like, but if you put 0,
that'll do.

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:02.264
Okay.
So, this is the elementary

01:01:02.264 --> 01:01:05.916
parts of this thing.
And I already told you the

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:09.781
following things.
If x(t) is equal to

01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:14.860
A cos Ωt--let's
put φ = 0.

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.250
In other words,
we'll agree that since there's

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.694
only one oscillator,
it is perverse to set your

01:01:19.694 --> 01:01:22.775
clock to 0 at any time other
than when the oscillator is at

01:01:22.775 --> 01:01:25.673
one extreme point.
If there are two oscillators

01:01:25.673 --> 01:01:28.398
oscillating out of step,
it's impossible to make

01:01:28.398 --> 01:01:31.534
φ = 0 for both of them.
Because if you can sync your

01:01:31.534 --> 01:01:33.988
clock when one of them is at a
maximum, that may not be when

01:01:33.988 --> 01:01:36.684
the other one's at a maximum.
But with one oscillator,

01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:39.300
to choose φ other than
0 is perverse.

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.307
It's like saying,
"I'm doing a projectile

01:01:41.307 --> 01:01:43.776
problem.
I'll pick the place where I

01:01:43.776 --> 01:01:46.690
launch the projectile to be x =
y = 0."

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:49.389
You can pick some other crazy
origin, but it doesn't help.

01:01:49.389 --> 01:01:52.380
So, we'll assume φ is 0
in this problem.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.780
If that is x,
what is velocity at time

01:01:55.780 --> 01:01:59.117
t?
Take the derivative of this,

01:01:59.117 --> 01:02:02.849
you get minus Ω A
sin Ωt.

01:02:02.849 --> 01:02:07.170
That means the velocity is also
oscillating sinusiodally but the

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:11.010
amplitude for oscillation is
Ω times A.

01:02:11.010 --> 01:02:13.543
So, if A is the range of
variation for x,

01:02:13.543 --> 01:02:16.639
Ω times A is the
range of variation for velocity.

01:02:16.639 --> 01:02:19.612
Velocity will go all the way
from plus Ω A to minus

01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:21.488
Ω A.
The acceleration,

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:24.690
which is one more derivative,
is minus Ω

01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:26.869
^(2)A,
cos Ωt.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:30.989
Which is really minus Ω
^(2) times x itself.

01:02:30.989 --> 01:02:35.455
So, the amplitude for
oscillation for the acceleration

01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:39.035
is Ω^(2) times A.
So, I think you should

01:02:39.035 --> 01:02:41.349
understand if Ω is very
large;

01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:44.425
then, the velocity will have
very big excursions and the

01:02:44.425 --> 01:02:47.110
acceleration will have even
bigger excursions,

01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.925
because the range of,
this A really means if

01:02:49.925 --> 01:02:52.739
you plot x,
it's going to look like this,

01:02:52.739 --> 01:02:54.550
going from A to minus
A.

01:02:54.550 --> 01:02:58.235
This says if you plot the
velocity, it's going to look

01:02:58.235 --> 01:03:01.239
like this.
The range will go from Ω

01:03:01.239 --> 01:03:04.502
A to minus Ω A.
If you plot the acceleration,

01:03:04.502 --> 01:03:06.537
it'll go from Ω
^(2)A to minus Ω

01:03:06.537 --> 01:03:07.140
^(2)A.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.460
Last thing you want to verify
is the Law of Conservation of

01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.643
Energy.
I think I mentioned this to you

01:03:17.643 --> 01:03:20.049
when I studied energy,
but let me repeat one more

01:03:20.049 --> 01:03:21.544
time.
If you take,

01:03:21.544 --> 01:03:24.826
in this problem,
½ mv^(2) +½

01:03:24.826 --> 01:03:30.570
kx^(2)--I did that for
you--You can also verify this.

01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:34.671
Okay?
½ kx^(2) is going to

01:03:34.671 --> 01:03:39.489
involve A^(2) cosine
squared Ωt.

01:03:39.489 --> 01:03:41.842
½ mv^(2) is going to
involve something,

01:03:41.842 --> 01:03:43.989
something, something sin^(2)
Ωt.

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:45.418
And by magic,
sin^(2) and

01:03:45.418 --> 01:03:47.630
cos^(2) will have the
same coefficient,

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.645
so you can use the identity to
set them equal to 1,

01:03:50.645 --> 01:03:53.600
and get an answer that does not
depend on time.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.209
That's the beauty.
Even though position and

01:03:56.209 --> 01:03:59.020
velocity are constantly
changing, this combination,

01:03:59.020 --> 01:04:01.720
if you crank it out,
will not depend on time.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:05.558
And what can it possibly be?
If it doesn't depend on time,

01:04:05.558 --> 01:04:07.320
I can calculate it whenever I
like.

01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.215
So, let me go to the instant
when the mass has reached one

01:04:11.215 --> 01:04:13.880
extremity and is about to swing
back.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:16.360
At that instant it has no
velocity;

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:19.146
it only has an x,
which is equal to amplitude,

01:04:19.146 --> 01:04:21.414
or motion.
So, that's the energy of an

01:04:21.414 --> 01:04:24.415
oscillator, ½ kA^(2).
When v = 0,

01:04:24.415 --> 01:04:27.935
x will be plus or minus
A, but any other

01:04:27.935 --> 01:04:30.858
intermediate point you can find
the velocity,

01:04:30.858 --> 01:04:34.429
if you give me the x.
We did that too.

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:41.280
So, this is all I want to say
about the linear oscillator.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:45.088
But let me mention to you
another kind of oscillation,

01:04:45.088 --> 01:04:50.909
which is very interesting.
Suppose you suspend a rod from

01:04:50.909 --> 01:04:55.679
the ceiling like this.
It's hanging there.

01:04:55.679 --> 01:05:00.051
If you give it a twist,
then it'll go twisting back and

01:05:00.051 --> 01:05:03.371
forth, like that.
That's also a simple harmonic

01:05:03.371 --> 01:05:06.810
motion, except what's varying
with time is not the linear

01:05:06.810 --> 01:05:09.086
coordinate,
but the angle θ by

01:05:09.086 --> 01:05:14.421
which the rod has been twisted.
What's the equation in this

01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:17.860
case?
The equation here is I,

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:21.380
d 2θ over
dt^(2).

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.829
You guys remember now,
that's the analog of ma?

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:25.800
That's going to be equal to the
torque.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:35.349
Now, what'll happen in the
problems we consider is that

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:39.238
θ is a small number,
and the torque will be such

01:05:39.238 --> 01:05:42.550
that it brings you back to
θ = 0.

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:47.442
So, this number will be
approximately equal to minus

01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:51.280
some number κ times
θ.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:55.050
That's the analog of minus
kx.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:58.928
Little k was the
restoring force divided by the

01:05:58.928 --> 01:06:01.928
displacement,
which produced the restoring

01:06:01.928 --> 01:06:04.044
force.
Little κ is the

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:07.836
restoring torque divided by the
angle at which you twisted it to

01:06:07.836 --> 01:06:12.130
get that torque.
So, this isn't always true.

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:15.324
For small oscillations,
sin τ vanishes at

01:06:15.324 --> 01:06:17.688
θ = 0;
it will look like some number

01:06:17.688 --> 01:06:19.067
times θ.
If you like,

01:06:19.067 --> 01:06:21.900
it's the Taylor series for
τ for small angles.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.039
If you knew this κ you
are done, because

01:06:25.039 --> 01:06:27.911
mathematically,
this equation is the same as

01:06:27.911 --> 01:06:31.051
md 2 x over
dt^(2) is minus

01:06:31.051 --> 01:06:34.267
kx.
Because the Ω for this

01:06:34.267 --> 01:06:37.989
guy will be square root of
κ over I.

01:06:37.989 --> 01:06:40.682
You can steal the whole answer,
because mathematically,

01:06:40.682 --> 01:06:43.575
mathematicians don't care if
you're talking about θ

01:06:43.575 --> 01:06:45.570
or if you're talking about
x.

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:49.146
Now, if you compare this
equation to this equation,

01:06:49.146 --> 01:06:52.938
md 2 x over
dt^(2) equal to minus

01:06:52.938 --> 01:06:55.539
kx,
if the Ω there was the

01:06:55.539 --> 01:06:58.633
root of k over m,
the Ω here would be

01:06:58.633 --> 01:07:02.410
root of κ over I.
So, you may be thinking,

01:07:02.410 --> 01:07:06.788
"Give me an example where
τ looks like κ

01:07:06.788 --> 01:07:09.078
times θ."
I'm going to give you that

01:07:09.078 --> 01:07:09.320
example.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.060
So, that example is going to be
the following simple pendulum.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.890
Take a pendulum like this.
It's got a mass m.

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.710
It's got some length l;
it's hanging from the ceiling.

01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:41.115
It's a rigid rod,
not a string,

01:07:41.115 --> 01:07:43.360
but a rigid,
massless rod.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.179
And the mass m is at the
bottom.

01:07:46.179 --> 01:07:50.770
So, it's happy to hang like
this, but suppose you give it a

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.966
kick, so you push it over there
to an angle θ,

01:07:54.966 --> 01:08:01.634
which is whatever you like.
What is the torque in this

01:08:01.634 --> 01:08:05.579
particular case?
Let's find out.

01:08:05.579 --> 01:08:08.888
The force is mg,
and the angle between the

01:08:08.888 --> 01:08:12.402
force--and you're trying to do
rotations around this

01:08:12.402 --> 01:08:15.780
point--this angle here is the
same θ.

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:23.720
So, torque is really minus
mgl sin θ.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.811
That's the formula for torque.
It's the force times the

01:08:28.811 --> 01:08:32.549
distance of the lever arm or the
distance over which the force is

01:08:32.549 --> 01:08:36.112
from the rotation axis times the
sine of the angle between the

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:39.850
direction of the force and the
direction of the separation.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:44.456
So, the equation for the
pendulum really is the

01:08:44.456 --> 01:08:50.765
following: Id^(2) θ over
dt^(2) is equal to minus

01:08:50.765 --> 01:08:56.621
mgl sin θ.
Now, we cannot do business with

01:08:56.621 --> 01:08:59.252
this equation.
This equation is a famous

01:08:59.252 --> 01:09:02.090
equation, but you and I don't
know how to solve it with what

01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:03.855
we know.
But we have learned,

01:09:03.855 --> 01:09:07.439
even earlier today--look at the
formula for sin x.

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.267
Sin x begins with
x minus x^(3) over

01:09:10.267 --> 01:09:13.786
3 factorial, and so on.
So, if θ is small,

01:09:13.786 --> 01:09:16.649
then you may write
mglθ.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:20.113
So, for small angles,
sin θ is

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:23.577
θ, and the restoring
torque, in fact,

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:27.119
is linear in the angle of the
coordinate.

01:09:27.119 --> 01:09:31.449
So, by comparison now,
we know that this fellow is our

01:09:31.449 --> 01:09:34.229
κ.
So, κ for the pendulum

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:36.329
is mgl.
So, κ may not be

01:09:36.329 --> 01:09:39.130
universal in every problem,
in each problem you've got to

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:41.676
find κ.
You find that by moving the

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:44.970
system off equilibrium,
finding the restoring torque,

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:47.430
and if you're doing it right,
restoring torque will always

01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:49.764
look like something,
something, something times

01:09:49.764 --> 01:09:51.564
θ.
Everything multiplying

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:55.259
θ is our κ.
So, let's now calculate

01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:58.529
Ω for the simple
pendulum.

01:09:58.529 --> 01:10:03.094
I've shown you this is
κ over I,

01:10:03.094 --> 01:10:07.720
and κ was mgl.
And what's I?

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:13.560
It's equal to moment of inertia
of this mass around this point.

01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.314
The rod is massless.
For a single point mass,

01:10:16.314 --> 01:10:18.556
we know the moment of inertia
is just m times

01:10:18.556 --> 01:10:21.555
l^(2).
So, you find Ω is equal

01:10:21.555 --> 01:10:26.221
to square root of g over
l, and that is 2π

01:10:26.221 --> 01:10:29.308
over T.
So, you get back the famous

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:32.627
formula you learned,
T is 2π square

01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:37.555
root of l over g.
This is the origin of the

01:10:37.555 --> 01:10:42.087
formula you learned in school.
It comes from small

01:10:42.087 --> 01:10:47.170
oscillations of a pendulum.
So, think about this problem.

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:50.579
If you pulled a pendulum by an
angle so large that sin

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:53.478
θ is no longer
approximated by θ but

01:10:53.478 --> 01:10:57.001
you need a θ^(3) over 6
term -- it can happen for large

01:10:57.001 --> 01:11:00.723
enough θ – then,
the equation to solve is no

01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.320
longer this.
What that means is,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.537
if you took a real pendulum
with a massless rod and a bob at

01:11:08.537 --> 01:11:11.361
the end,
the time it takes to finish an

01:11:11.361 --> 01:11:14.569
oscillation, in fact,
will depend on the amplitude.

01:11:14.569 --> 01:11:16.735
But only for small
oscillations,

01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:20.787
when sin θ can
be approximated by θ,

01:11:20.787 --> 01:11:24.909
you will find whether you do
that the time is the same.

01:11:24.909 --> 01:11:27.561
But if you go too far,
the other terms in sin

01:11:27.561 --> 01:11:30.162
θ will kick in,
and the result is no longer

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:31.776
true.
The period of a pendulum,

01:11:31.776 --> 01:11:34.345
in fact, is not just a function
of l and g,

01:11:34.345 --> 01:11:36.180
but also a function of the
amplitude.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:40.079
Only for small amplitudes,
you get this marvelous result.

01:11:40.079 --> 01:11:42.760
There's one problem I want you
to think about.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:46.478
I may do it myself.
I think you should try to read

01:11:46.478 --> 01:11:49.460
up on it, and I will try to
explain it next time.

01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:58.277
I'll give the problem to you
and I will do it for you next

01:11:58.277 --> 01:12:00.020
time.
I want you to think about it.

01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.460
Here is a hoop,
like a hula hoop.

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:06.140
It's hanging on the wall with a
nail.

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:08.600
And it's very happy to be where
it is.

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.770
Now, I come and give it a
little push.

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:13.630
It'll start oscillating.
It'll look like that,

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.829
and some time later it'll look
like that, it's going back and

01:12:16.829 --> 01:12:19.092
forth.
Your job is to find the

01:12:19.092 --> 01:12:21.030
Ω for that hoop.

01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:28.763
So, you move it a little bit,
and you find the restoring

01:12:28.763 --> 01:12:30.539
torque.
And you're done.

01:12:30.539 --> 01:12:33.720
But you've got to do two things
right to get the right answer.

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.667
You've got to find the moment
of inertia for circular loop not

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:38.890
around the center,
but around the point and the

01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:41.000
circumference.
So, you guys know the magic

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.750
words you've got to use.
Parallel Axis theorem.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.470
And to find the restoring
torque, here is the part that

01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:49.622
blows everybody's mind.
When the loop goes to that

01:12:49.622 --> 01:12:52.170
position, where is gravity
acting?

01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:54.750
Gravity's acting at the center
of mass.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:58.359
The center of mass is somewhere
here in the middle of the loop,

01:12:58.359 --> 01:13:00.630
even though there is no matter
there.

01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:05.950
So, center of mass of a body
need not lie on the body.

01:13:05.950 --> 01:13:09.568
The ring is a perfect example.
So, if you remember the center

01:13:09.568 --> 01:13:12.757
of mass of a loop is in the
center of the loop and put the

01:13:12.757 --> 01:13:15.191
mg there,
you will get the right torque,

01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:16.699
and everything will just
follow.

01:13:16.699 --> 01:13:21.819
By the way, my offer to you is
always open.

01:13:21.819 --> 01:13:25.157
If there's something about the
class you want to change,

01:13:25.157 --> 01:13:27.888
you find it's hard,
this, that, you can always

01:13:27.888 --> 01:13:30.099
write to me.
I want your feedback,

01:13:30.099 --> 01:13:32.814
because I just don't know which
parts are easy,

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:34.939
which parts are hard,
which are slow,

01:13:34.939 --> 01:13:37.825
which are fast.
But if you haven't had enough

01:13:37.825 --> 01:13:41.235
math and you need some help,
send me some e-mail and I will

01:13:41.235 --> 01:13:43.101
try my best to answer them.

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.598
Prof: What is the
significance of the real date on

00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:09.920
Sancho's letter,
one wonders?

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.875
I don't have a ready answer for
it, but remember that it does

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:15.260
have the real date.
 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.311
It is obviously the date when
Cervantes is writing this part

00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:20.960
of the Quixote.
 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.279
It may be a way of emphasizing
that the novel is dealing with

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.866
current history and situating
the novel chronology in a

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.940
specific way.
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.570
This is why the letter is given
a date.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.270
It didn't have to have a date,
but I think that that is the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.100
reason why.
 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.979
I think that's the best answer
that I can give to the question

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.332
of why that letter,
what the significance--what

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:58.716
that date on the letter,
and what the significance of it

00:00:58.716 --> 00:00:59.000
is.
 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.489
But this is the sort of detail
that I want you to look for.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.144
Remember my mantra:
details, details,

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:09.159
details.
 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.590
Literature is made of specific
concrete details,

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.968
not of abstractions,
like philosophy,

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:18.640
and this is why it is important
to remember,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.998
to notice details,
and to base your

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.260
interpretations on the details.
 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.632
Now, as we move closer to the
end the Quixote I would

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:35.822
like to make some general
comments and revisit some of the

00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:39.920
themes that I have touched upon
earlier,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.156
as a way of summing up our
reading of this great classic

00:01:45.156 --> 00:01:49.060
that we have been reading all
semester.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.765
In the last lecture I talked
about the increasing presence of

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:58.730
Virgil and of his Aeneid,
and suggested that Cervantes is

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.242
hinting at the significant
responsibility that his

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:06.040
protagonist is assuming,
which is quite different from

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.456
that of the ancient hero,
but no less important:

00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:14.846
to conquer himself,
to come to grips and control

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:18.687
his madness,
and to assimilate his new won

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:25.012
realization of the vanity of his
dreams and the futility of his

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:25.930
quest.
 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.995
His task is to bring himself to
harmony with the world in which

00:02:31.995 --> 00:02:35.157
he lives,
full of imperfections and

00:02:35.157 --> 00:02:39.375
disappointments,
and to assume a resigned

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:45.990
attitude towards it and prepare
for his impending death.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.780
If at the beginning of the
semester I quoted Lukács,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.050
George Lukács,
the Hungarian critic,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.295
to the effect that the
Quixote was the epic of a

00:02:56.295 --> 00:03:00.834
world abandoned by God,
Don Quixote's epic task within

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:04.900
the novel is to cope with such a
world,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.408
to conquer such a world,
as it were.

00:03:09.408 --> 00:03:13.681
His is a very modern condition
in that sense,

00:03:13.681 --> 00:03:17.470
but not necessarily a
despairing one.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.264
This, I think,
is what the novel shows as the

00:03:21.264 --> 00:03:26.269
hero begins his return home,
and this is why I'm asking you

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.340
to try to finish it.
 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.087
Don Quixote's change is gradual
and it began with,

00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:43.489
I think, Dulcinea's enchantment
by Sancho, the shock of seeing

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:49.726
this peasant woman as Dulcinea;
and it peaked,

00:03:49.726 --> 00:03:55.086
I think, during the descent to
the cave of Montesinos,

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:57.008
as we mentioned.
 

00:03:57.008 --> 00:04:05.139
I think that he will display,
or he is displaying now,

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.197
a deepened kind of wisdom,
nowhere more memorably than in

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:17.343
the counsel he gives Sancho,
as his squire is prepared to

00:04:17.343 --> 00:04:22.730
take over the government of the
island of Barataria--

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.927
you remember that episode when
Don Quixote takes Sancho aside

00:04:28.927 --> 00:04:32.189
and,
after telling him not to gloat

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.541
about his great fortune,
but to thank God,

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.540
that this happened to him
without his really even trying,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.269
evincing, somewhat a little bit
of envy,

00:04:44.269 --> 00:04:46.949
good old Don Quixote.
 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.779
Here he takes him aside to give
him some counsel.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:56.781
This passage of the
Quixote is one of the more

00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:01.588
anthologized ones in the
Spanish-speaking world.

00:05:01.588 --> 00:05:07.711
I know a judge in Puerto Rico
who has these pages framed in

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:12.670
gold in his office,
and he shows them proudly to

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.259
anyone who happens to be near.
 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:23.274
They are wonderful--this
wonderful advice that Don

00:05:23.274 --> 00:05:29.437
Quixote gives Sancho,
and there are obvious

00:05:29.437 --> 00:05:37.360
philosophical and literary
sources to Don Quixote's wisdom,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.432
and there are also obvious
critical statements that refer

00:05:44.432 --> 00:05:51.000
to the current situation in
Spain and its empire,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.944
particularly,
the counsel regarding the

00:05:53.944 --> 00:05:57.819
corruption of people in power
and in government.

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:04.014
These are barbs at the
situation, at the Spanish

00:06:04.014 --> 00:06:05.860
bureaucracy.
 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.264
Don Quixote's advices have
bookish sources,

00:06:12.264 --> 00:06:18.519
but they also sound deeply
felt, and also,

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:25.230
as if they were,
grounded in experience.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:30.954
This is the knowledge of a
mature man, and Don Quixote is

00:06:30.954 --> 00:06:35.512
more than a mature man;
he's an old man by the

00:06:35.512 --> 00:06:39.699
standards of the age,
so he is in a position to

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.702
counsel Sancho,
who's younger and,

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.160
of course, his squire.
 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.293
The counterparts to Don
Quixote's wisdom are Sancho's

00:06:52.293 --> 00:06:57.180
proverbs,
which express a folksy kind of

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.500
astuteness and knowledge of
humankind,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:08.281
and, as we have seen,
Sancho can spew proverbs at the

00:07:08.281 --> 00:07:10.370
drop of a hat.
 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.762
Proverbs have been taken to be
the accumulated wisdom of the

00:07:16.762 --> 00:07:20.000
ages,
stored in the common memory of

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.512
mankind,
and were of great interest to

00:07:22.512 --> 00:07:26.144
Renaissance thinkers,
Renaissance thinkers,

00:07:26.144 --> 00:07:32.505
who were keenly attracted by
language and the knowledge that

00:07:32.505 --> 00:07:36.661
it contained,
both as a system of

00:07:36.661 --> 00:07:41.283
communications,
that is, language as grammar,

00:07:41.283 --> 00:07:46.019
and also for the contents of
the lore that it stored;

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:48.509
not only Latin and Greek,
the classics,

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.762
as the humanists were
interested and,

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:53.389
of course, as we know,
in the classics,

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:54.899
and in Latin,
and Greek, and Hebrew,

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:59.726
but also in the vernacular
languages in which they were

00:07:59.726 --> 00:08:00.709
immersed.
 

00:08:00.709 --> 00:08:02.730
They were very,
very interested in that.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.341
And, in fact,
there is a whole science of the

00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:14.242
study of proverbs whose name is,
in Spanish--I don't know if the

00:08:14.242 --> 00:08:21.288
word exists in English--
paramiología,

00:08:21.288 --> 00:08:25.069
the study of proverbs.
 

00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:28.052
There seem to be many more in
Spanish than in English,

00:08:28.052 --> 00:08:30.149
anyway;
I feel that way,

00:08:30.149 --> 00:08:35.320
but probably because Spanish is
my native language.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:41.779
But I remember summer nights at
the square in Salamanca,

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:44.259
a beautiful town square in
Salamanca,

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:46.240
sitting around with professors
of language,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.980
and seeing who could say more
proverbs,

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.260
and then, also,
we invented the game that one

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.268
would say the first part of a
proverb and another one would

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:57.431
say the second part of another
one that had nothing to do with

00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:02.085
it,
so it was a really great game

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:03.940
of proverbs.
 

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.330
Try it.
 

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.480
It's fun.
 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.760
So what I'm saying is that
proverbs are very much a part of

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.855
the language,
and they are a kind of a

00:09:13.855 --> 00:09:15.269
storehouse of wisdom.
 

00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:21.445
This is the counterpart of Don
Quixote's more bookish kind of

00:09:21.445 --> 00:09:22.678
knowledge.
 

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:25.090
The interest in grammar,
of course,

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.490
was that it was thought that
grammar and rhetoric could

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.240
reveal the very workings of the
human mind,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.759
and this is why humanists were
interested in it.

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:44.043
So now, in the end,
Sancho's wisdom is not going to

00:09:44.043 --> 00:09:50.668
be different from that of Don
Quixote.

00:09:50.668 --> 00:09:55.480
And it is certainly not
inferior, and in practice proves

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.580
to be quite effective.
 

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.460
Of course, Don Quixote's advice
extends to Sancho's appearance,

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:06.778
mode of dress,
to clip his fingernails,

00:10:06.778 --> 00:10:10.690
and what to wear on different
occasions,

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.927
how to have his wife behave so
that she won't show that she's

00:10:14.927 --> 00:10:17.320
just a peasant,
and all of that.

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.480
That is the funny part of the
advice.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:24.192
But Sancho's knowledge,
Sancho's wisdom is up to the

00:10:24.192 --> 00:10:24.840
task.
 

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:30.173
Sancho's acumen is sufficient
for him to deal with the

00:10:30.173 --> 00:10:35.509
challenges of government,
as it is for him to face the

00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:38.629
challenges of his own life.
 

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:42.750
Sancho is endowed with natural
reason.

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:47.279
This is a medieval concept that
I have mentioned before,

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.182
that courses through the
Renaissance and reaches the

00:10:50.182 --> 00:10:53.975
Enlightenment,
where it will be instrumental

00:10:53.975 --> 00:10:59.139
in the elaboration of modern
ideas about democracy,

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:02.408
ideas that we all share today.
 

00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:08.428
It is, ultimately,
as I have said several times,

00:11:08.428 --> 00:11:12.932
a common Christian doctrine,
that we are all endowed by God

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:16.970
with enough intelligence to make
it in the world,

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.658
no matter what our station in
life or level of education.

00:11:20.658 --> 00:11:25.159
But at the end of the episode,
unsuccessful through no fault

00:11:25.159 --> 00:11:29.813
of his own, Sancho rues that he
was not born to be a governor,

00:11:29.813 --> 00:11:30.730
he says.
 

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:34.950
He accepts the social order,
which was based,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.418
in spite of what I've just said
about natural reason,

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:41.942
was based strictly on the
ideology that a person's social

00:11:41.942 --> 00:11:45.186
station was determined by God,
and that it was best,

00:11:45.186 --> 00:11:48.291
as Sancho says,
to stick to what you are and to

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:51.080
the condition into which you
were born.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:57.158
This is a conflictive moment in
the novel,

00:11:57.158 --> 00:12:02.580
but the fact is that he has
done very well as governor,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.813
and only the deceptions of the
duke and his minions rob him of

00:12:06.813 --> 00:12:10.203
his real achievements,
real achievements in this

00:12:10.203 --> 00:12:13.379
fictional world in which he
accomplished them,

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:14.990
we must remember.
 

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:19.532
Now, in connection to this,
remember Auerbach's theory

00:12:19.532 --> 00:12:24.590
about the birth of realism and
the sermo humilis,

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.940
that is, the common discourse
of Christianity.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.610
So you can see that all of this
is connected,

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.496
but the contradiction,
of course, is that within the

00:12:37.496 --> 00:12:39.658
society,
which is a society that is

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.695
crumbling,
as I have been saying,

00:12:41.695 --> 00:12:44.793
this distinction,
these social distinctions,

00:12:44.793 --> 00:12:45.918
are important.
 

00:12:45.918 --> 00:12:49.952
They're crumbling because,
look, the most clever fellow in

00:12:49.952 --> 00:12:52.570
this whole episode is the
steward,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.142
who, after all,
is a servant,

00:12:55.142 --> 00:12:59.000
and Sancho does very well as a
governor.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.774
So this is the overall theme of
today's class,

00:13:02.774 --> 00:13:06.884
has to be, that is,
that the social structures are

00:13:06.884 --> 00:13:08.058
crumbling.
 

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:16.320
So we move to the island of
Barataria.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:22.460
Let us begin by talking about
the name.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.110
In the original,
Sancho refers to the island as

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.164
"í
;nsula,"

00:13:32.164 --> 00:13:38.798
let me put it as small so you
can see the accent,

00:13:38.798 --> 00:13:40.214
in lower case,
"í

00:13:40.214 --> 00:13:41.110
;nsula."
 

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.457
Now, of course,
by this time,

00:13:42.457 --> 00:13:45.202
the word for "island"
in Spanish was already the

00:13:45.202 --> 00:13:47.288
current word,
which is

00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:53.538
"isla,"
from the Latin.

00:13:53.538 --> 00:13:56.467
In the Latin,
when you had two consonants

00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:58.985
like that,
the tendency in the romance

00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:02.288
language is for the second one
to absorb the first one,

00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:03.371
so therefore,
from "í

00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:04.105
;nsula"
you get

00:14:04.105 --> 00:14:05.538
"isla,"
and in French you get

00:14:05.538 --> 00:14:06.428
"île."
 

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:11.970
Now, that's a little bit of
philology.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.272
So Sancho repeats
"í

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:22.269
;nsula,"
unaware that it is an archaic

00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:28.273
word then for island,
that Don Quixote uses because

00:14:28.273 --> 00:14:32.960
he has learned it reading the
romances of chivalry.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:37.543
Something that you lose
completely in the translation is

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:42.751
the fact that Don Quixote,
whenever the issue of chivalry

00:14:42.751 --> 00:14:45.120
arises,
or of Dulcinea,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.100
lapses into a kind of archaic
Spanish;

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.470
this is not done in the
translation.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:04.918
Meaning, he will say,
for instance,

00:15:04.918 --> 00:15:11.345
"fermosa"
for "hermosa,"

00:15:11.345 --> 00:15:17.318
which was by then already the
current Spanish word for

00:15:17.318 --> 00:15:20.250
"beautiful."
 

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.216
"Hermosa,"
if you want a little more

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:26.418
philology,
comes from the Latin from

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:28.929
"forma,"
"formosa,"

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:30.863
"shapely,"
in how the island of

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:32.409
"Formosa."
 

00:15:32.409 --> 00:15:36.120
Philology is fascinating.
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:41.899
So, whenever Don Quixote talks
about chivalric things,

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:45.059
he uses
"fablar"

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:49.110
for "hablar"
because,

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:51.883
by the sixteenth century,
the "f"

00:15:51.883 --> 00:15:55.120
of the Latin had become a
silent "h."

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:03.534
So Sancho uses "í
;nsula,"

00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:07.075
as the one,
he wants to rule an

00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:08.960
"í
;nsula,"

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.712
an island,
and he's using this archaic

00:16:12.712 --> 00:16:13.370
word.
 

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:15.428
So "ínsula
Barataria."

00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:17.700
Because of this usage in the
Quixote,

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:19.818
the word "í
;nsula"

00:16:19.818 --> 00:16:22.663
has a currency in Spanish now
and there is even a famous

00:16:22.663 --> 00:16:25.298
journal in Madrid called
Ínsula,

00:16:25.298 --> 00:16:30.879
after this archaic word used by
Don Quixote and Sancho.

00:16:30.879 --> 00:16:34.509
Now, "Barataria."
 

00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:41.639
Barataria--I can never find
the--here it is.

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:46.304
"Barataria"
comes from

00:16:46.304 --> 00:16:52.926
"barato,"
"barato"

00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:57.139
means "cheap."
 

00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:01.730
So this would be
"cheap-island."

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:07.769
Both because of its low cost
and its shoddy fragile

00:17:07.769 --> 00:17:12.358
construction,
it is like a stage set to

00:17:12.358 --> 00:17:18.519
perform the play that the
steward has prepared.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:22.057
It is cheap then also in the
sense that the island is not

00:17:22.057 --> 00:17:22.500
real.
 

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.279
I think that a better
translation, if we were going to

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:28.167
translate everything,
would be something like

00:17:28.167 --> 00:17:31.848
"Chintzy Island"
would be the name of it.

00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:35.298
Of course, Sancho does not
pierce through the name,

00:17:35.298 --> 00:17:40.058
to realize that this is not a
very promising name for his

00:17:40.058 --> 00:17:44.140
kingdom to be ruling "cheap
island."

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.507
He doesn't know exactly--he
doesn't know at all what it

00:17:47.507 --> 00:17:49.501
means, but this is what it
means,

00:17:49.501 --> 00:17:51.558
"Barataria."
 

00:17:51.558 --> 00:18:00.198
Now, let us begin by pointing
out the sources of the steward's

00:18:00.198 --> 00:18:04.502
invention,
the practice of making someone

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:09.430
king for a day was common in
carnival celebrations throughout

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:15.170
Europe since the Middle Ages,
and further back to saturnalias.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:20.807
The joke, that is,
the humor, was in seeing how a

00:18:20.807 --> 00:18:26.798
low class dolt would act out his
role as a king,

00:18:26.798 --> 00:18:32.259
or to have someone play the
role of someone from the lower

00:18:32.259 --> 00:18:35.710
classes trying to act like a
king.

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:39.786
It could also be just a skit,
but part of the carnival

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:43.710
practice was to make somebody a
king for the day.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.079
This involved,
in saturnalias,

00:18:46.079 --> 00:18:49.922
and in these kinds of
carnivals, an inversion of

00:18:49.922 --> 00:18:50.740
roles.
 

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:57.630
We have echoes of that in
today's secret societies here,

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:01.933
in fraternities,
when they have that day where

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:06.240
the pledges are in charge of the
brothers,

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:09.720
all of those things that I'm
sure you have heard about are

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.140
atavistic retentions of this
carnival type of ritual,

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:18.700
where you make someone a king
for a day.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.470
In fact, in the 1950s there was
a TV show called Queen for a

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:24.711
Day,
I don't know if you ever heard

00:19:24.711 --> 00:19:29.001
of it,
in which a common housewife was

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:34.000
crowned queen for the day in the
show,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.089
and she got to rule over
people, and to have anything she

00:19:39.089 --> 00:19:41.509
wanted,
and so forth.

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:47.009
Yes, television incorporated
some of these carnivalesque

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:48.210
practices.
 

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.950
Now, the practice extends to
other cultures beyond the

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:54.740
western tradition.
 

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:00.696
Besides, the practice of making
a stranger king and then

00:20:00.696 --> 00:20:04.884
deposing him,
is one so prevalent that Sir

00:20:04.884 --> 00:20:07.830
James Frazer--
I have mentioned him before but

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.865
you've got to remember his name,
Sir James Frazer,

00:20:11.865 --> 00:20:19.656
F-R-A-Z-E-R--devoted many pages
of his classic The Golden

00:20:19.656 --> 00:20:23.618
Bough to this practice.
 

00:20:23.618 --> 00:20:29.167
The idea was to punish the
ruler for the perquisites that

00:20:29.167 --> 00:20:34.487
he enjoyed while being king,
and for not having been able to

00:20:34.487 --> 00:20:36.829
solve problems,
such as droughts and other

00:20:36.829 --> 00:20:37.769
natural catastrophes.
 

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:41.828
We'll see this later,
when I quote Freud.

00:20:41.828 --> 00:20:48.702
So the steward is basing his
elaborate prank on a traditional

00:20:48.702 --> 00:20:54.200
routine, though he does take it
to an extreme.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.880
This not just king for a day,
but for several days,

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.528
and it's consistent in this
expansion,

00:21:01.528 --> 00:21:05.720
and this exaggeration with the
Baroque character of Part II.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.157
The point is that the whole
thing is supposed to be a joke

00:21:10.157 --> 00:21:14.128
at Sancho's expense,
and it is part of the merriment

00:21:14.128 --> 00:21:17.009
at the duke and duchess's
palace.

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:22.492
It also part of the merriment
for the participants in this

00:21:22.492 --> 00:21:26.534
whole charade,
they are acting it out as if

00:21:26.534 --> 00:21:28.940
this were a carnival.
 

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:38.420
There are other traditional
elements in the episode,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.098
traditional acts,
traditional scenes,

00:21:43.098 --> 00:21:47.083
for instance,
the one in which Sancho passes

00:21:47.083 --> 00:21:51.900
judgment on several cases that
come up before him.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:55.630
It's a traditional one that
goes back even to the Bible--

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:02.568
King Solomon--and also in folk
traditions,

00:22:02.568 --> 00:22:06.900
the traditions of riddles that
rulers,

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.788
or wise men,
are supposed to solve.

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:15.230
The tradition of oracles,
back to the Greeks,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:21.108
and so Sancho solves several
complicated cases,

00:22:21.108 --> 00:22:25.130
every single one of them coming
from folk tradition,

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:31.002
but hilarious at the same time,
probably because of it they are

00:22:31.002 --> 00:22:32.140
hilarious.
 

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.425
For instance,
Sancho solves a case involving

00:22:37.425 --> 00:22:39.640
an alleged rape.
 

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:47.846
This is the very funny episode
where the man is accused of

00:22:47.846 --> 00:22:53.921
having raped this woman;
the man, furthermore,

00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:59.474
is the lowest of the lowest;
presumably these are all people

00:22:59.474 --> 00:23:00.380
acting out.
 

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:04.529
He's a hog herder, a pig keeper.
 

00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:08.338
I mean, this is the lowest;
remember, in the first part,

00:23:08.338 --> 00:23:10.210
when the keeper of pigs
arrives,

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:12.857
and even the mention of the
word "puerco"

00:23:12.857 --> 00:23:15.366
in Spanish has to be followed
by "excuse me,"

00:23:15.366 --> 00:23:17.180
"puerco"
for pig,

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:22.028
and he's supposed to have
forced himself on this woman,

00:23:22.028 --> 00:23:31.459
and Sancho has to decide,
and he asks if the man gave her

00:23:31.459 --> 00:23:36.009
a bag of money,
and when she's leaving,

00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:40.236
he says, take it from her,
and she fights like an animal

00:23:40.236 --> 00:23:43.718
so as not to give up the money,
and then, he says,

00:23:43.718 --> 00:23:46.270
well if you had defended like
yourself like that there would

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.180
have been no rape.
 

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:51.778
But this is a case,
remember, that I mentioned this

00:23:51.778 --> 00:23:55.162
in--
when I talked about the

00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:59.226
prisoner of sex:
this is a case of

00:23:59.226 --> 00:24:03.781
"fornicatio
simplex,"

00:24:03.781 --> 00:24:07.970
a case of simple fornication.
 

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.430
The Inquisition and Spanish law
had classified fornication.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.220
The Inquisition and its laws,
and all of that,

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.734
followed scholastic practice of
classifications very

00:24:19.734 --> 00:24:21.775
Aristotelic,
so there was simple

00:24:21.775 --> 00:24:24.210
fornication, and then qualified
fornication,

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:27.420
of which there were several
kinds depending on whether--

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.923
simple fornication is sex
between two people who are

00:24:30.923 --> 00:24:35.180
unmarried and of different sex,
and then complex fornication

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.130
comes when the people are of the
same sex;

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.498
one is married,
both are married but to other

00:24:41.498 --> 00:24:43.259
people, and so forth.
 

00:24:43.259 --> 00:24:48.351
So this is a case of
fornicatio simplex that

00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:53.240
Sancho, the judge,
is passing his sentence on;

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.328
it is one of the traditional
stories.

00:24:57.328 --> 00:25:04.157
Now, then he has to--he is
presented with a very

00:25:04.157 --> 00:25:10.259
complicated case about Clara
Perlerina,

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:12.588
"Clara,"
clear,

00:25:12.588 --> 00:25:15.083
"Perlerina"
derived from "pearl,"

00:25:15.083 --> 00:25:18.338
"clear pearl";
she's quite a pearl.

00:25:18.338 --> 00:25:23.880
Remember, this is the young
woman, presumably,

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.910
in this completely made up
story within the made up story,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:33.521
the usual receding sequence in
Cervantes who is half beautiful

00:25:33.521 --> 00:25:35.690
and half horrible.
 

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:44.415
If you turn to your page 769:
"'I say then' quoth the

00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:46.994
countryman,
'that this son of mine,

00:25:46.994 --> 00:25:49.222
who is to be the bachelor,
fell in love,

00:25:49.222 --> 00:25:53.279
in the same village with a
damsel called Clara Perlerina,

00:25:53.279 --> 00:25:57.650
daughter of Andrés
Perlerino,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.767
a very rich farmer;
and this name of Perlerino came

00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:03.469
not to them by lineal,
or any other descent,

00:26:03.469 --> 00:26:07.048
but because all of that race
are subject to the palsy;

00:26:07.048 --> 00:26:10.558
and to mend the name,
they call them Perlerines;

00:26:10.558 --> 00:26:16.038
though to say the truth,
the damsel is like any oriental

00:26:16.038 --> 00:26:21.915
pearl, and, looked at on the
right side, seems a very flower

00:26:21.915 --> 00:26:25.053
of the field;
but, on the left,

00:26:25.053 --> 00:26:28.692
she is not quite so fair;
for, on that side,

00:26:28.692 --> 00:26:31.714
she wants an eye,
which she lost by the

00:26:31.714 --> 00:26:34.440
small-pox;
and, though the pits in her

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.944
face are many and deep,
her admirers say,

00:26:36.944 --> 00:26:39.010
they are not pits,
but sepulchres,

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:42.078
wherein the hearts of her
lovers are buried.

00:26:42.078 --> 00:26:44.992
She is so cleanly,
that, to prevent defiling her

00:26:44.992 --> 00:26:48.538
face,
she carries her nose so crooked

00:26:48.538 --> 00:26:51.051
up,
that it seems to be flying from

00:26:51.051 --> 00:26:54.769
her mouth: and for all of that
she looks extremely well;

00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:58.836
for she has a large mouth;
and, did she not lack half a

00:26:58.836 --> 00:27:03.038
score or a dozen teeth and
grinders, she might pass,

00:27:03.038 --> 00:27:06.498
and make a figure,
among ladies of the best

00:27:06.498 --> 00:27:07.568
fashion.
 

00:27:07.568 --> 00:27:09.549
I say nothing of her
lips...'"

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:10.640
And so on...
 

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.250
Sancho sees through all of
this, as something made up,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.050
and refuses to grant this,
but this is a very interesting

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.248
figure,
because, I have mentioned in

00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:21.676
the last class,
the figure of the monster who's

00:27:21.676 --> 00:27:26.440
made up of contrasting features,
of opposing features.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.872
In the case of Trifaldín
it was the black robe and the

00:27:29.872 --> 00:27:32.413
white beard,
black and white,

00:27:32.413 --> 00:27:37.150
and here, it is extreme beauty
on one half,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.519
and on the other,
this horrendous face,

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:43.720
pockmark, and lacking an eye,
and all of that;

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.019
the two very opposites clashing
in one figure.

00:27:48.019 --> 00:27:53.640
This is in reference to this
Baroqueness of Part II,

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:59.256
but also, to show Sancho's
sharp wit to see through this

00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:05.076
prank that they are trying to
play on him within the prank

00:28:05.076 --> 00:28:08.548
that he is already undergoing.
 

00:28:08.548 --> 00:28:11.491
If you compare Clara to
Maritornes you see that

00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:13.858
Maritornes is not that
symmetrical.

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:20.826
Maritornes is ugly from the top
down, and--whereas here,

00:28:20.826 --> 00:28:26.019
we have a perfect symmetry,
as it were.

00:28:26.019 --> 00:28:29.980
Now, you have to remember,
always, and I keep insisting on

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.151
this, this is all made up by the
steward who is the author of

00:28:34.151 --> 00:28:35.750
this whole charade.
 

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:48.804
Now, the gist of the episode is
given by the steward himself,

00:28:48.804 --> 00:28:55.113
when he says,
in page 798,781,

00:28:55.113 --> 00:29:00.773
when he says:
"â€˜My lord governor,'

00:29:00.773 --> 00:29:03.318
quoth the steward,
'speaks so well,

00:29:03.318 --> 00:29:07.635
that I wonder to hear a man,
so void of learning as your

00:29:07.635 --> 00:29:09.236
worship,
who, I believe,

00:29:09.236 --> 00:29:13.566
cannot so much as read,
say such and so many things,

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:17.500
and all so sententious and
instructive,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.439
and so far beyond all that
could be expected from your

00:29:20.439 --> 00:29:23.490
worship's former understanding
by those who sent us,

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.058
and by us, who are come hither.
 

00:29:26.058 --> 00:29:28.308
But every day produces new
things;

00:29:28.308 --> 00:29:31.583
jests turn into earnest,
and jokers are joked

00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:35.262
upon.'"
It is good to remember here,

00:29:35.262 --> 00:29:41.029
and I'm going to repeat a quote
from that American hispanist,

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:44.156
Ruth El-Saffar,
that is very appropriate at

00:29:44.156 --> 00:29:48.368
this point,
and I'll repeat it.

00:29:48.368 --> 00:29:52.497
She wrote: "All of Part II
is based on the mistaken

00:29:52.497 --> 00:29:55.650
assumption on the part of the
would-be,

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.790
all-controlling character
authors that they can deal with

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.820
the fictional character and
maintain at the same time a

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.131
distance which allows them never
to slip into that fictional

00:30:05.131 --> 00:30:08.328
world with which they plan to
entertain themselves.

00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:11.090
Like Sansón,
they are trapped from two

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.353
directions,
they are controlled to some

00:30:13.353 --> 00:30:16.479
extent from within their play by
the very characters whom they

00:30:16.479 --> 00:30:20.148
intend to manipulate,
and from without by an author

00:30:20.148 --> 00:30:24.846
of whom they are unaware but
whose will and whose hand all

00:30:24.846 --> 00:30:27.730
that they do is contrived."
 

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.240
And this is the case here,
of course,

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.073
of the steward who is himself
acknowledging that the things

00:30:33.073 --> 00:30:37.038
have turned out not quite the
way that he had planned it,

00:30:37.038 --> 00:30:39.328
that he and the duke and
duchess had planned it,

00:30:39.328 --> 00:30:42.971
which was, of course,
to have fun at the expense of

00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:44.743
Sancho,
but Sancho turns out,

00:30:44.743 --> 00:30:49.404
on the contrary,
to be quite a good governor,

00:30:49.404 --> 00:30:53.440
and so the tables are turned.
 

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:57.295
This is another one of these
inversions that are happening

00:30:57.295 --> 00:31:00.338
regularly in Part II of the
Quixote.

00:31:00.338 --> 00:31:07.288
It is also good to notice that
the steward is aware of both of

00:31:07.288 --> 00:31:13.669
his construction of this whole
episode and of its sort of

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:15.150
collapse.
 

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:21.070
Now, in a larger sense,
Barataria has to do with the

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:27.457
breakdown of aristocratic
authority and the emergence of

00:31:27.457 --> 00:31:31.868
the common man as potential
ruler.

00:31:31.868 --> 00:31:36.713
Sancho proves to be wise,
beyond all expectations,

00:31:36.713 --> 00:31:42.152
and in spite of all of the
pranks that he and his master

00:31:42.152 --> 00:31:43.240
endure.
 

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:46.739
As with Clavileño,
the episode that we discussed

00:31:46.739 --> 00:31:50.304
in the last class,
his dignity remains untouched,

00:31:50.304 --> 00:31:53.609
and the mockers are the ones
who are mocked.

00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:59.646
Sancho became a good governor;
this is this the ironic result,

00:31:59.646 --> 00:32:03.419
a counter intuitive resolution
that thwarts the designs of the

00:32:03.419 --> 00:32:06.449
duke and duchess and that
undermines the authorial

00:32:06.449 --> 00:32:09.849
intentions of the steward who
obviously wanted Sancho to

00:32:09.849 --> 00:32:12.509
provide the humor by acting
stupid,

00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:17.328
and this is,
in part, and this is something

00:32:17.328 --> 00:32:21.460
that I have not mentioned
before,

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:29.240
but that is easy to figure out,
these are misreadings of Part

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.304
I,
on the part of characters in

00:32:32.304 --> 00:32:33.078
Part II.
 

00:32:33.078 --> 00:32:39.115
They assume that the characters
are going to act in a certain

00:32:39.115 --> 00:32:41.462
way,
by the way they have

00:32:41.462 --> 00:32:45.615
interpreted Part I,
and they have interpreted Part

00:32:45.615 --> 00:32:50.396
I with Sancho as a buffoon,
Sancho as just a comic

00:32:50.396 --> 00:32:57.598
character, which is the way that
Avellaneda interpreted Sancho,

00:32:57.598 --> 00:33:00.618
if we remember the class on
Avellaneda,

00:33:00.618 --> 00:33:06.053
so it's good to keep this in
mind, that these are misreadings

00:33:06.053 --> 00:33:10.038
on the part of the steward,
on the part of the duke and

00:33:10.038 --> 00:33:12.285
duchess,
who expect Don Quixote and

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:17.188
Sancho to act in a certain way,
so these are mistakes in the

00:33:17.188 --> 00:33:18.038
reading.
 

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:27.928
Now, besides the folkloric
sources that I have mentioned of

00:33:27.928 --> 00:33:38.670
Barataria, the background is
also literary and philosophical.

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:46.338
It is a self contained society,
presumably to be well run.

00:33:46.338 --> 00:33:49.788
This is the humanistic theme of
utopia.

00:33:49.788 --> 00:33:56.220
Going back to Thomas
More--remember,

00:33:56.220 --> 00:34:03.673
I have been mentioning all
along the names of important

00:34:03.673 --> 00:34:08.780
Renaissance figures that you
must--

00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:11.219
that you should remember.
 

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:22.960
Of course, it's easy for you to
just check it out in Wikipedia.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:30.699
More was the author of
Utopia,

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:33.199
the book of the same name,
just published in 1516,

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:50.840
also, Tommaso Campanella,
1568-1639,

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.710
who published City of the
Sun in 1602,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.489
which was also a utopia.
 

00:34:55.489 --> 00:35:00.655
This is the idea that the
perfect society can be

00:35:00.655 --> 00:35:06.809
established on this earth
following a rational design.

00:35:06.809 --> 00:35:11.775
The concept goes back,
of course, to Plato's

00:35:11.775 --> 00:35:15.679
Republic,
and to all of the treatises

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:19.159
that begin to appear in the
Renaissance about the art of

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:20.811
government,
including, of course,

00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:21.949
Machiavelli's The
Prince,

00:35:21.949 --> 00:35:24.170
that I have mentioned several
times here.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:30.900
The Prince is also in
the background here,

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.480
because Sancho is trying to act
like the perfect prince,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.019
like the perfect ruler,
and hence Machiavelli's The

00:35:37.019 --> 00:35:40.360
Prince is in the background
of this episode.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.489
So see how many important
Renaissance thinkers are behind

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:48.460
in this episode.
 

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.500
But what does it mean?
 

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:53.969
I mean, utopia--these utopias,
by the way,

00:35:53.969 --> 00:35:56.840
are the origin of modern
political systems,

00:35:56.840 --> 00:36:01.184
or the idea that with the
political system you can create

00:36:01.184 --> 00:36:04.909
or improve a society to make it
like a utopia.

00:36:04.909 --> 00:36:07.719
In the eighteenth century,
particularly,

00:36:07.719 --> 00:36:13.260
these ideas will become a
reality and they have become,

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:15.873
of course, as we know,
nightmares in the twentieth

00:36:15.873 --> 00:36:17.800
century,
some of these utopias have

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.760
turned out to be quite the
opposite,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:25.556
to the point that you've had to
have walls to keep the people

00:36:25.556 --> 00:36:27.199
inside of them.
 

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:34.115
But--so this is the idea that
you can rationally create a

00:36:34.115 --> 00:36:39.920
perfect society,
and so, what is it here in this

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:44.119
episode of the Quixote?
 

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:48.900
Is it a parody of these notions
of utopia?

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:54.164
I mean, Barataria is a mock
utopia, of course,

00:36:54.164 --> 00:36:59.197
with a fake king,
and it all ends in a great

00:36:59.197 --> 00:37:01.070
catastrophe.
 

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:08.909
Is it a parody showing the
futility of such attempts?

00:37:08.909 --> 00:37:11.289
It could be.
 

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:15.365
I think that the episode is
important enough and given

00:37:15.365 --> 00:37:20.056
enough relevance in the book to
invite interpretations of this

00:37:20.056 --> 00:37:20.750
kind.
 

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:24.567
Now, Barataria,
being an island,

00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:29.369
reflects other things,
three of them.

00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:32.137
For instance,
one, the idea of self

00:37:32.137 --> 00:37:35.070
containment and self
sufficiency,

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.838
of roundness,
as is it were,

00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:39.195
and at one point it is referred
to as

00:37:39.195 --> 00:37:41.750
"redonda,"
round,

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:44.472
the island is round,
and islands tend to be self

00:37:44.472 --> 00:37:47.057
contained because,
of course, they're surrounded

00:37:47.057 --> 00:37:47.530
by water.
 

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:51.806
Two, I think,
Barataria also reflects the

00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:56.940
recently discovered islands of
the Caribbean,

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.699
recently, you know,
late fifteenth century,

00:38:00.699 --> 00:38:04.898
early sixteenth century,
where the Spaniards attempted

00:38:04.898 --> 00:38:08.780
to create societies almost from
the ground up,

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:21.409
in Hispaniola and in Cuba,
and also the wished for,

00:38:21.409 --> 00:38:24.170
but never reached,
islands of the classical

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.960
tradition.
 

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:35.900
These were called,
I'm going to put it in English,

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:42.090
"ante-islands,"
this is where you get the name

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:46.820
for "Antilles,"
the Antilles,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.583
comes from those "before
islands,"

00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:50.963
those islands;
these were fugitive islands,

00:38:50.963 --> 00:38:53.128
that is,
islands that you saw in the

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:55.188
distance,
and you were supposed to arrive

00:38:55.188 --> 00:38:57.322
at,
and like the oasis in the

00:38:57.322 --> 00:39:01.690
desert, as you came closer,
they got further and further

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:06.168
away, suggesting that these were
islands that you wanted to

00:39:06.168 --> 00:39:09.085
reach,
and that perhaps you would find

00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:12.079
utopia,
or an oasis, or something.

00:39:12.079 --> 00:39:15.847
Of course, on this level,
the island has that quality of

00:39:15.847 --> 00:39:19.480
elusiveness that one would
associate with Atlantis.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:24.347
So, if you can see,
the depth of this episode in

00:39:24.347 --> 00:39:29.110
the Quixote by dint of
the many sources,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.460
ideas and books that it has
behind it.

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.275
Now, Freud mentions this
episode in Totem and

00:39:38.275 --> 00:39:44.630
Taboo, and his take on this
episode is very instructive.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.788
Now, remember,
I mentioned,

00:39:45.788 --> 00:39:49.170
I think in an earlier class,
that Freud was a devoted reader

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.019
of Cervantes,
and that as an adolescent he

00:39:52.019 --> 00:39:55.512
created a Cervantes club with
several friends to read

00:39:55.512 --> 00:39:58.067
Cervantes and discuss it,
and so forth,

00:39:58.067 --> 00:40:00.916
and they even gave themselves
names from characters in some of

00:40:00.916 --> 00:40:04.789
The Exemplary Stories,
and all of that.

00:40:04.789 --> 00:40:09.956
Now, as you will see,
Freud interprets this episode

00:40:09.956 --> 00:40:15.228
by sort of reducing it to his
own system, of course,

00:40:15.228 --> 00:40:18.639
and thinkers tend to do that.
 

00:40:18.639 --> 00:40:23.719
Freud examines the suffering a
king must undergo to pay for his

00:40:23.719 --> 00:40:28.061
exalted position in the
traditions that I have already

00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:30.929
mentioned--in Frazer,
remember.

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:35.740
To Freud, this is played out
chiefly in the hilarious scene

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:38.230
where Sancho is denied food.
 

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:45.594
Freud is drawing an analogy
between certain neurosis and the

00:40:45.594 --> 00:40:50.414
behavior of primitives,
focusing on the ambivalent

00:40:50.414 --> 00:40:54.172
attitude towards kings and its
analog in their relationships of

00:40:54.172 --> 00:40:58.005
children to their fathers;
people to the king,

00:40:58.005 --> 00:41:00.300
children to fathers.
 

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.438
He says--I quote:
"Here the importance of a

00:41:03.438 --> 00:41:06.018
particular person is
extraordinarily heightened,

00:41:06.018 --> 00:41:09.503
and his omnipotence is raised
to the improbable in order to

00:41:09.503 --> 00:41:12.865
make it easier to attribute to
him the responsibility for

00:41:12.865 --> 00:41:15.809
everything painful that happens
to a patient.

00:41:15.809 --> 00:41:19.458
Savages really do not act
differently towards their rulers

00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:22.980
when they ascribe to them power
over rain and shine,

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.244
wind and weather,
and then dethrone or kill them

00:41:25.244 --> 00:41:28.280
because nature has disappointed
their expectation of a good hunt

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:29.630
or a ripe harvest."
 

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.750
Of course, you can see the
figure of the father,

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:38.851
the omnipotent father,
and hence, all of the theories

00:41:38.851 --> 00:41:42.679
Freud had about the Oedipal
complex,

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:47.219
and all of that. He goes on:
"Thus, also the taboo

00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:51.534
ceremonial of kings is nominally
an expression of the highest

00:41:51.534 --> 00:41:55.920
veneration [because the relation
to the father is an ambiguous

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.637
one,
of veneration and hostility]

00:41:58.637 --> 00:42:00.780
and a means of guarding them.
 

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.900
Actually, it is the punishment
for their elevation,

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.018
the revenge which their
subjects take upon them.

00:42:07.018 --> 00:42:11.630
The experiences which Cervantes
makes Sancho Panza undergo as

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:15.858
governor of his island have
evidently made him recognize

00:42:15.858 --> 00:42:20.471
this interpretation of courtly
ceremonial as the only correct

00:42:20.471 --> 00:42:21.239
one.
 

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.898
It is very possible that this
point would be corroborated if

00:42:24.898 --> 00:42:28.742
we could induce kings and rulers
of today to express themselves

00:42:28.742 --> 00:42:30.170
on the point."
 

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:32.086
Here, Freud,
of course, is being ironic:

00:42:32.086 --> 00:42:34.791
let's ask kings and rulers
today if they want to undergo

00:42:34.791 --> 00:42:36.018
this kind of process.
 

00:42:36.018 --> 00:42:40.309
Then, he goes on,
to make the unavoidable

00:42:40.309 --> 00:42:44.280
comparison with the Christian
myth.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.375
He goes: "Why the
emotional attitude towards

00:42:47.375 --> 00:42:50.922
rulers should contain such a
strong unconscious share of

00:42:50.922 --> 00:42:53.760
hostility is a very interesting
problem.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:57.360
We have already referred to the
infantile father complex.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:42:59.940
We may add that an
investigation of the early

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:03.460
history of kingship would bring
the decisive explanations.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.043
Frazer, [Sir James Frazer,
whom I mentioned]

00:43:06.043 --> 00:43:09.768
has an impressive discussion of
the theory that the first kings

00:43:09.768 --> 00:43:12.679
were strangers,
who, after a short reign,

00:43:12.679 --> 00:43:16.235
were destined to be sacrificed
at solemn festivals as

00:43:16.235 --> 00:43:19.849
representatives of their deity,
but Frazer himself does not

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:21.929
consider these facts all
together convincing.

00:43:21.929 --> 00:43:25.572
Christian myths are said to
have been still influenced by

00:43:25.572 --> 00:43:29.018
the after effects of this
evolution of kings."

00:43:29.018 --> 00:43:31.998
Look at the idea of the slaying
of Jesus Christ,

00:43:31.998 --> 00:43:34.280
the king of the Jews and so
forth.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:38.001
But you can see how this
illuminates what is going on in

00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:42.195
Barataria with Sancho Panza,
how Freud's take on this help

00:43:42.195 --> 00:43:44.869
us understand better the
mechanisms.

00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:49.000
Now, this is part of the
traditional background,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.726
but also, of course,
the nightmare of finally

00:43:53.726 --> 00:43:58.063
getting what you crave,
and not being able to quite get

00:43:58.063 --> 00:43:58.960
your hands on it.
 

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.130
You know, those wish
fulfillment dreams,

00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:04.577
where you have that cake--let's
put it in those terms and not

00:44:04.577 --> 00:44:08.197
give it an erotic twist--
that pie or something that you

00:44:08.197 --> 00:44:10.585
want,
and that you're about to get,

00:44:10.585 --> 00:44:14.635
and you don't quite get;
but also the disappointment of

00:44:14.635 --> 00:44:16.079
achieving things.
 

00:44:16.079 --> 00:44:20.170
Things are never quite that we
imagined or desired,

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.780
but they say,
be careful of what you wish,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:25.989
because you may get it,
and once you get it,

00:44:25.989 --> 00:44:28.780
it may turn out to be not
exactly what you expected,

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:31.300
and there is something of that
here, too.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:35.099
This is the strong
desengaño element,

00:44:35.099 --> 00:44:37.760
of these episodes on this
island.

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.851
The scene that so fascinated
Freud, in which Pedro Recio de

00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:50.469
Agüero--that's a name that
we might want to also unpack.

00:44:50.469 --> 00:44:52.762
This is the doctor,
the very funny doctor,

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:54.440
who keeps saying,
"No, no,

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.880
no, you can't eat that;
that's the worst you can eat!

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:05.619
No, no, no, you cannot eat
that."

00:45:05.619 --> 00:45:09.639
"Recio"
means "hard."

00:45:09.639 --> 00:45:10.949
Hard."
 

00:45:10.949 --> 00:45:12.961
"Me llevas
recio,"

00:45:12.961 --> 00:45:17.507
you're treating me hard,
you say in Spanish,

00:45:17.507 --> 00:45:22.940
"de
Agüero."

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.898
It can be a last name,
but

00:45:23.898 --> 00:45:26.050
"agüero"
means "omen."

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.800
"Omen";
"mal aguero,"

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:34.010
a bad omen, and he is a
"natural de

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:35.920
Tirteafuera."
 

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:42.730
That's the name of the town he
comes from;

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.000
it means "keep you
out";

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.739
this is what it means,
keep you out.

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:52.492
When I was a kid,
and you wanted to get rid of a

00:45:52.492 --> 00:45:55.355
kid,
an adult would tell him,

00:45:55.355 --> 00:45:59.534
"Go see so-and-so and ask
her to give you some

00:45:59.534 --> 00:46:03.650
tenteallá,
keep you there.

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.099
Tell her to give you some
tenteallá,

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:07.250
keep you there."
 

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:09.210
So Tirteafuera is more or less
like that.

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.650
This is quite a remarkable
character, this doctor.

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.730
This is a very
Molière-like scene.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.313
If you've read Molière,
in Molière there is

00:46:20.313 --> 00:46:23.567
always,
this hilarious criticism of

00:46:23.567 --> 00:46:26.338
doctors,
who are always going around

00:46:26.338 --> 00:46:30.199
with a huge enema trying to give
an enema to somebody and that

00:46:30.199 --> 00:46:33.018
sort of thing,
or whenever the situation is

00:46:33.018 --> 00:46:37.119
difficult,
they begin declining Latin

00:46:37.119 --> 00:46:40.199
nouns and verbs,
because, of course,

00:46:40.199 --> 00:46:42.690
the idea is to know Latin well
to be able to read the sources,

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:47.530
because medicine was at this
point still very scholastic,

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.670
based on all of this on
sources, on written sources,

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:52.869
more than on experience.
 

00:46:52.869 --> 00:46:53.860
Some of it was on experience.
 

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:58.956
See, part of the Baroque is the
clash between the scholastic

00:46:58.956 --> 00:47:03.536
traditional knowledge that does
not stand up to actual

00:47:03.536 --> 00:47:07.230
experience,
and this is why the critique of

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:10.360
medicine is so important and so
relevant.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:12.128
It's not just funny,
because this scene is

00:47:12.128 --> 00:47:14.300
hilarious,
it's very, very funny,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:18.771
but it's also very significant
because it reflects a condition

00:47:18.771 --> 00:47:19.869
of the time.
 

00:47:19.869 --> 00:47:29.320
Now, the end of Sancho's
government is catastrophic,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.043
as you know,
and it's one episode in which

00:47:32.043 --> 00:47:35.875
like the fall from the horse,
where the horse explodes,

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:37.650
he may have been injured.
 

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:48.088
Now, Barataria is also like a
laboratory experience on

00:47:48.088 --> 00:47:53.800
fiction, on fiction making.
 

00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:59.969
How does one create a fictional
world coherent within itself.

00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:03.061
All fiction,
all novels, or stories,

00:48:03.061 --> 00:48:07.476
are the creation of a coherent
world within itself,

00:48:07.476 --> 00:48:10.480
one that is round,
as it were.

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.679
The fiction obviously gets out
of hand of the steward,

00:48:15.679 --> 00:48:17.690
and he cannot quite stand
outside of it,

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:22.099
like a puppeteer,
and this is parallel to Master

00:48:22.099 --> 00:48:27.081
Peter and his puppet show,
and perfection,

00:48:27.081 --> 00:48:36.429
of course, of this fictional
world cannot be quite achieved,

00:48:36.429 --> 00:48:38.230
and this is parallel to,
of course,

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:40.914
Cervantes's situation
vis-à-vis the

00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:41.768
Quixote.
 

00:48:41.768 --> 00:48:45.483
One way that I imagine,
it is, I mean if this is the

00:48:45.483 --> 00:48:48.735
world of fiction,
the creator,

00:48:48.735 --> 00:48:55.320
the steward,
is here trying to control it,

00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:59.030
but he winds up here,
and once he is inside,

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.960
he does not have the all
encompassing perspective,

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.965
and he has all of the problems
that the characters he has

00:49:04.965 --> 00:49:05.768
created have.
 

00:49:05.768 --> 00:49:10.550
So that is the--this is where
the irony comes in and this is

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:13.445
where--
but on the other hand,

00:49:13.445 --> 00:49:18.329
this effort to create,
this self contained coherent

00:49:18.329 --> 00:49:20.400
fiction anticipates...
 

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.019
What?
 

00:49:23.019 --> 00:49:24.710
Macondo!
 

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.820
The fictional village in One
Hundred Years of Solitidue;

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.512
Comala, the fictional village
in Rulfo's Pedro

00:49:31.512 --> 00:49:35.445
Páramo--
if you're not aware of this

00:49:35.445 --> 00:49:39.800
Rulfo, Juan Rulfo,
the great Mexican writer,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:46.659
and his novel that I--
Pedro Páramo.

00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:51.063
So, from the idea of utopia,
to also to the idea of creating

00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:54.349
a fictional world,
you see the connection?

00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:58.949
This is all behind the island
of Barataria.

00:49:58.949 --> 00:50:09.570
Now, we are going to talk next,
in the next class,

00:50:09.570 --> 00:50:13.063
about Altisidora,
this mock Dido that I hope you

00:50:13.063 --> 00:50:16.454
are reading,
and also about Dueña

00:50:16.454 --> 00:50:20.018
Rodríguez;
this is the one whose daughter

00:50:20.018 --> 00:50:23.519
is impregnated,
and whose boyfriend refuses to

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:28.202
marry her and they don't put
pressure on him because he's the

00:50:28.202 --> 00:50:33.039
son of the peasant who lends
money to the duke and duchess.

00:50:33.039 --> 00:50:36.179
She's a very interesting
character;

00:50:36.179 --> 00:50:39.592
she's the one who reveals the
physical defects of the duchess

00:50:39.592 --> 00:50:40.730
and of Altisidora.
 

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:42.730
What are the physical defects
of these women?

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.630
The duchess,
who is sort of the beautiful

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:49.440
huntress and all of that,
apparently has some sores on

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:54.746
her legs that--
from which some liquid flows,

00:50:54.746 --> 00:50:59.329
and Altisidora has bad breath.
 

00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:02.710
This beautiful Altisidora,
who sings,

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.800
and all of that,
Dueña Rodríguez,

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.873
with great resentment,
says she has "un

00:51:08.873 --> 00:51:12.860
aliento cansado,"
a tired breath,

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.480
so she has that.
 

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:18.643
These are defects that we would
not have found in the idealized

00:51:18.643 --> 00:51:22.505
women of Part I,
and so this is significant

00:51:22.505 --> 00:51:27.380
about Dueña
Rodríguez and the things

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.369
that she reveals.
 

00:51:29.369 --> 00:51:37.018
But I want to finish by talking
about Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:51:37.018 --> 00:51:43.340
the pair, because I came across
two recent articles on the two

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:49.659
of them as a pair that I want to
sort of summarize for you.

00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:52.869
One is by Antonio
Carreño Rodríguez.

00:51:52.869 --> 00:52:02.289
I emphasize the "rs"
and the

00:52:02.289 --> 00:52:08.909
"eñes."
 

00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:13.802
And Antonio Carreño
talks about the influence of Don

00:52:13.802 --> 00:52:17.599
Quixote and Sancho on modern
comedy pairs,

00:52:17.599 --> 00:52:21.920
such as Abbott and Costello,
Oliver and Hardy,

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:28.210
and even takes it all the way
up to characters in Seinfeld,

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:35.869
a show that I have to confess I
have never in my life seen,

00:52:35.869 --> 00:52:42.760
but he has a picture here,
of characters from that show,

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:49.115
that apparently show a decided
influence from Don Quixote and

00:52:49.115 --> 00:52:50.070
Sancho.
 

00:52:50.070 --> 00:52:53.885
He also gives the folkloric
background of these pairs,

00:52:53.885 --> 00:52:58.132
going back to the Middle Ages,
and projected then forward on

00:52:58.132 --> 00:52:59.500
to the present.
 

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:03.072
I mean, Abbott and Costello,
one is fat, the straight man,

00:53:03.072 --> 00:53:06.581
and then the other--you can
see, immediately the moment I

00:53:06.581 --> 00:53:07.960
mentioned it,
yes!

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.179
This is Don Quixote and Sancho
in film.

00:53:10.179 --> 00:53:17.679
The other is an article by my
friend Edwin Williamson,

00:53:17.679 --> 00:53:21.682
who's a distinguished Oxford
hispanist and it has to do with

00:53:21.682 --> 00:53:26.230
what it terms the power struggle
between Don Quixote and Sancho,

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:29.760
which is resolved ultimately in
favor of the squire,

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.914
because Don Quixote is having
to beg him to please give

00:53:33.914 --> 00:53:38.070
himself the lashes necessary to
disenchant Dulcinea.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.085
He mentions four episodes:
the fulling hammers,

00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:43.840
when Don Quixote hits him over
the head;

00:53:43.840 --> 00:53:51.947
and the enchanted Dulcinea,
when there is an inversion of

00:53:51.947 --> 00:53:56.117
roles,
and Sancho is now the one

00:53:56.117 --> 00:54:03.112
creating the chivalric kind of
reality out of normal every day

00:54:03.112 --> 00:54:05.594
life;
Merlin's prophecy,

00:54:05.594 --> 00:54:10.554
when he states that it is
Sancho who must give himself the

00:54:10.554 --> 00:54:14.730
lashes on his behind to
disenchant Dulcinea,

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:19.268
which then makes Don Quixote
dependent on Sancho;

00:54:19.268 --> 00:54:23.528
and finally,
a chapter that you--an episode

00:54:23.528 --> 00:54:27.889
you may not have read yet in
chapter LX,

00:54:27.889 --> 00:54:31.063
the fight between the two of
them, when Don Quixote tries to

00:54:31.063 --> 00:54:34.293
force Sancho to give himself
lashes and takes his clothes off

00:54:34.293 --> 00:54:37.442
to give him the lashes,
and Sancho wrestles Don Quixote

00:54:37.442 --> 00:54:39.717
to the ground,
and puts his knee on his chest,

00:54:39.717 --> 00:54:41.329
and says that he will not do
that.

00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:49.065
Williamson gives and
appropriately political reading

00:54:49.065 --> 00:54:55.889
to this power struggle,
with which I agree.

00:54:55.889 --> 00:55:00.643
I think he's unduly harsh about
the end, when he says that

00:55:00.643 --> 00:55:06.150
Sancho is being totally cynical,
even at Don Quixote's deathbed.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:08.750
I think that Williamson went a
little bit too far there,

00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.715
but I want to,
in conclusion,

00:55:11.715 --> 00:55:15.530
today to read you his
conclusion,

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:20.193
because it is very much in tune
with what I have been saying

00:55:20.193 --> 00:55:25.094
about Barataria and the rise of
the common man to a position of

00:55:25.094 --> 00:55:27.547
government:
"Cervantes,

00:55:27.547 --> 00:55:31.554
moreover [says Williamson]
was not unaware of the wider

00:55:31.554 --> 00:55:35.860
political dimension of the power
struggle that he had first

00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:40.313
adumbrated as far back as the
fulling mills [fulling hammers]

00:55:40.313 --> 00:55:42.170
episode in Part I.
 

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:45.938
In the final crisis,
when the knight has been forced

00:55:45.938 --> 00:55:50.141
to the ground by his squire,
Sancho's defiant assertion,

00:55:50.141 --> 00:55:54.288
'Ayúdome a mí,
que soy mi señor,'

00:55:54.288 --> 00:55:58.090
'I help myself because I am my
own master,' inevitably carries

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:01.922
political resonances,
for it implies a conscious

00:56:01.922 --> 00:56:06.903
rejection of the traditional
basis of authority and status

00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:11.449
and portends the emergence of a
different world,

00:56:11.449 --> 00:56:15.380
a world that Cervantes himself
must have imagined with

00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:18.960
disquiet,
if not with dread.

00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.056
Thus, at the heart of the
Quixote there is an

00:56:22.056 --> 00:56:23.210
intriguing irony.
 

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:27.431
Cervantes may well have started
out on his adventure of writing

00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:30.632
with the purely literary aim of
discrediting the

00:56:30.632 --> 00:56:33.969
máquina mal
fundada of the chivalric

00:56:33.969 --> 00:56:37.851
romances but by a series of
logical steps arising from the

00:56:37.851 --> 00:56:41.733
interaction of master and
servant he was lead to undermine

00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:46.023
the principle hierarchy that was
the cornerstone of the ideology

00:56:46.023 --> 00:56:48.000
of his day."
 

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.619
We will continue with this and
other themes in the next class.

00:56:52.619 --> 00:56:58.000

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.730
Prof: Okay,
let's start up.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.960
So last time we got to the
point of asking the question,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.430
are there atoms and molecules
-- and well,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.890
I anticipate that the answer is
yes --

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.370
and what force holds the atoms
together?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.310
Because if we really understand
the force that holds them,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.170
we've got chemistry all solved.
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.919
So when you come to the idea of
forces, in the first place,

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:34.750
one goes back to Newton and
Principia Mathematica.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.145
And he had the idea,
or developed the idea,

00:00:38.145 --> 00:00:40.490
the mathematics of gravity.
 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.185
And the interesting thing about
it was there was no mechanism

00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:44.740
for it.
 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.943
There were no springs or
strings that connected the

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:48.520
things.
 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.720
It was action at a distance.
 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.670
So there were other ideas.
 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.817
Like, Descartes had the idea
that gravity resulted from

00:00:57.817 --> 00:01:01.075
blocked repulsion,
that the universe was full of

00:01:01.075 --> 00:01:03.798
particles zipping around and
bombarding things.

00:01:03.798 --> 00:01:07.558
So like the moon would be
bombarded by particles from all

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:11.516
directions, but there'd be no
net force on it because they'd

00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:12.860
all balance out.
 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.256
However, if you put the earth
in the way, there'd be a shadow,

00:01:17.256 --> 00:01:21.652
and now you'd have more things
hitting the moon from the right

00:01:21.652 --> 00:01:23.310
than from the left.
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.549
So it would seem to be
attracted to the earth.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.780
So that's a great mechanism.
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.839
Now, it was important for
Newton that the force be

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:42.280
proportional to r^2,
to inverse r^2,1/r^2.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.450
Does this work for that?
 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.800
If you pulled the earth back,
how would you change things?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.440
What do you say?
 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.030
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.860
It doesn't work for this.
 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.209
Prof: It doesn't work?
 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:59.599
Would it block more or fewer
things if you pulled it back?

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.879
Students:  Fewer.
 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:03.030
Prof: How many fewer?
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.727
Suppose you made it twice as
far back, how many fewer would

00:02:06.727 --> 00:02:08.960
be blocked from hitting the
moon?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.409
Student:  Wouldn't it be
r^2?

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.819
Prof: It would be 1/r^2.
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.620
You can think about that.
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.938
So that aspect of it would work.
 

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:23.003
How about -- you know gravity
is proportional to the mass of

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:23.680
the things.
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.560
How does that figure?
 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.520
You can think about that
yourselves, okay?

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.068
But anyhow, there were other
ideas.

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:33.444
But Newton didn't think about
the mechanism,

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:37.056
he thought about the law,
that it was 1/r^2 and

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.490
proportional to the masses.
 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.532
Now in 1717,
he published the Second Edition

00:02:44.532 --> 00:02:46.878
of Opticks.
 

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:51.663
He published the First Edition
in 1704, and the reason he

00:02:51.663 --> 00:02:56.620
published it in 1704 was that
Robert Hooke died in 1703.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.812
He'd actually -- Newton had
done this work in the 1660s and

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:04.358
'70s,
but he didn't publish it until

00:03:04.358 --> 00:03:07.893
Hooke died because he didn't
want Hooke to get on his case,

00:03:07.893 --> 00:03:08.990
criticizing it.
 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.383
But in the Second Edition,
in 1717, he put some additional

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:14.468
material;
you see, "with Additions.

00:03:14.468 --> 00:03:17.502
" And the additional
material, even though the book

00:03:17.502 --> 00:03:19.817
is about optics,
the additional material is

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:20.919
about chemistry.
 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:27.215
And it's at the end,
and posed not as hypotheses but

00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:30.913
as questions,
because Baconian people,

00:03:30.913 --> 00:03:34.504
following Francis Bacon,
weren't supposed to make

00:03:34.504 --> 00:03:37.160
hypotheses,
but they could ask questions.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.430
So here are some of the
questions.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.111
Question thirty-one,
the one that has most to do

00:03:42.111 --> 00:03:44.446
with chemistry:
"Have not the small

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:46.460
Particles of Bodies certain
Powers,

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.520
Virtues, or Forces by which
they act at a distance,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.180
not only on the Rays of Light
to reflect,

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.912
refract and inflect them,
but also upon one another for

00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:02.990
producing a great part of the
Phaenomena of Nature?"

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.521
(And this attraction between
the particles or repulsion)

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:10.375
"For it's well known that
Bodies act upon one another by

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.098
the Attractions of Gravity,
Magnetism and Electricity;

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:17.689
and these Instances shew the
Tenor and Course of Nature,

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.084
and make it not improbable but
that there may be more

00:04:21.084 --> 00:04:23.240
attractive Powers than these.
 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.939
For Nature is very consonant
and conformable to her self.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:33.238
How these Attractions may be
perform'd, I do not here

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:34.360
consider.
 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.851
What I call Attraction may be
perform'd by

00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:42.870
impulse…"
Where did he get that idea?

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.899
Where did he get the idea that
there are impulses that can

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:46.910
cause attraction?
 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.879
Student:
&gt;

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.168
Prof: That was
Descartes' idea,

00:04:53.168 --> 00:04:55.389
that we just explained.
 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.959
"…or by some other
means unknown to me.

00:04:57.959 --> 00:05:02.670
I use that Word here to signify
only in general any Force by

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.980
which Bodies tend toward one
another, whatsoever be the

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:07.778
Cause.
 

00:05:07.778 --> 00:05:12.562
For we must learn from the
Phaenomena of Nature what Bodies

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:16.382
attract one another,
and what are the Laws and

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:20.581
Properties of attraction,
before we enquire the Cause by

00:05:20.581 --> 00:05:23.480
which the Attraction is
perform'd."

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.336
(So get the law first so you
can do mathematics on it,

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:30.028
and then worry about how it
works.)

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:32.994
"The Attractions of
Gravity, Magnetism and

00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:36.732
Electricity, react to very
sensible distances…"

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:40.211
(He doesn't mean reasonable,
he means ones that you can

00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.050
sense.)
 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.560
"…and so have been
observed by vulgar Eyes."

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.995
(You can see the distances over
which electrostatic attraction

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:53.470
works, obviously gravity,
magnetism.)

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.492
"And there may be others
which reach to so small

00:05:57.492 --> 00:06:01.050
distances as hitherto to escape
observation;

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.053
and perhaps electrical
Attraction may reach to such

00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:06.757
small distances,
even without being excited by

00:06:06.757 --> 00:06:07.899
Friction."
 

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:10.918
(So you know that friction can
generate static electricity

00:06:10.918 --> 00:06:14.935
that'll make things attract,
but maybe even without friction

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:19.382
you can get things that'll
attract a very short distance by

00:06:19.382 --> 00:06:20.610
electricity.)
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.886
"The Parts of all
homogeneal hard Bodies which

00:06:23.886 --> 00:06:26.704
fully touch one another,
stick together very

00:06:26.704 --> 00:06:27.949
strongly."
 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:31.848
Did you ever have that
experience of having two really

00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:36.113
flat things, put them together
and they're very hard to get

00:06:36.113 --> 00:06:37.860
apart;
what?

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.129
Student: Slides.
 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.850
Student:  Small things.
 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.850
Prof: Microscope slides.
 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.949
Ever take out new microscope
slides?

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.180
They can be very hard to get
apart.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.483
"And for explaining how
this may be, some have invented

00:06:49.483 --> 00:06:52.839
hooked Atoms,
which is begging the Question;

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:56.139
and others tell us that Bodies
are glued together by rest,

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.410
that is, by an occult Quality,
or rather by nothing,

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.439
and others that they stick
together by conspiring motions,

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:06.079
that is by relative rest among
themselves."

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.230
(These are other theories that
are sort of complicated;

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.899
we don't need to go into it.)
 

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:14.750
"I had rather infer from
their Cohesion,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.350
that their Particles attract
one another by some Force,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:24.060
which in immediate Contact is
exceeding strong,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.004
at small distances performs the
chymical Operations above

00:07:28.004 --> 00:07:31.163
mention'd,
and reaches not far from the

00:07:31.163 --> 00:07:34.529
Particles with any sensible
Effect."

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:39.670
(So a very short-range,
a very strong attraction.)

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:43.281
"…reaches not far
from the Particles with any

00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.829
sensible Effect."
 

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:49.230
So maybe it's even more
dramatic than 1/r^2.^( )1/r^2

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.209
changes very rapidly when r gets
very small,

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:56.500
but maybe it's even a law
that's more distance dependant

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.447
than that,
but only works at really,

00:07:58.447 --> 00:07:59.569
really small distances.
 

00:07:59.569 --> 00:08:03.492
"The Attraction"
(and he's talking about between

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:07.759
glass plates separated by a thin
film of the Oil of Oranges;

00:08:07.759 --> 00:08:09.394
so you know,
microscope slides,

00:08:09.394 --> 00:08:12.062
they put a little drop of
something and stick them

00:08:12.062 --> 00:08:15.221
together and they're really hard
to get apart) "may be

00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:18.163
proportionally greater"
(the attraction) "and

00:08:18.163 --> 00:08:21.485
continue to increase until the
thickness do not exceed that of

00:08:21.485 --> 00:08:23.720
a single Particle of Oil."
 

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:29.444
(Imagine Newton,
350 years ago or 300 years ago

00:08:29.444 --> 00:08:35.419
here, thinking about a single
particle of oil.

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:40.649
Could he possibly measure that?
 

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:42.549
We'll think about that later.
 

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:44.168
Okay.)
 

00:08:44.168 --> 00:08:47.883
"There are therefore
Agents in Nature able to make

00:08:47.883 --> 00:08:51.458
the Particles of Bodies stick
together by very strong

00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:52.558
Attractions.
 

00:08:52.558 --> 00:08:56.663
And it is the business of
experimental Philosophy to find

00:08:56.663 --> 00:08:57.908
them out."
 

00:08:57.908 --> 00:09:01.182
That's what we need to
find, what is it that holds

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:02.759
these particles together?
 

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:05.390
"Experimental
philosophy"

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.629
means science.
 

00:09:06.629 --> 00:09:09.697
And we're going to engage in
this business,

00:09:09.697 --> 00:09:13.936
and it'll take us about five
weeks to figure out what it is

00:09:13.936 --> 00:09:16.639
that holds these things
together.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.402
Now, let's just look,
from physics,

00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:24.437
at the amount of binding energy
you get from different kinds of

00:09:24.437 --> 00:09:25.168
laws.
 

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:27.817
First there's Coulomb's law;
so it charges over the

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:28.399
distance.
 

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:30.690
I think you all know that one.
 

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.610
Then there's magnetic
interaction, two magnetic

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:39.639
dipoles, and the energy is
1/r^3, falls off very rapidly.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.703
Then there's the
"strong"

00:09:41.703 --> 00:09:45.529
binding that holds particles
together in the nuclei of atoms.

00:09:45.529 --> 00:09:48.840
And gravitation, of course.
 

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.009
And the chemical bond.
 

00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:54.707
So here's a scale of energies,
and we use, in this course,

00:09:54.707 --> 00:09:56.914
the old fashioned
kilocalories/mol,

00:09:56.914 --> 00:10:00.028
which American organic chemists
like to use.

00:10:00.028 --> 00:10:02.759
Some day it'll change to
kilojoules/mol,

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:05.629
but for me it's still
kilocalories/mol.

00:10:05.629 --> 00:10:08.977
Okay, this is a logarithmic
scale, so it covers a very wide

00:10:08.977 --> 00:10:09.440
range.
 

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.664
Now Coulomb,
if you have a proton and an

00:10:11.664 --> 00:10:14.347
electron,
as far apart as the distance of

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:17.986
the carbon-carbon bond,
that's 216 kilocalories/mol,

00:10:17.986 --> 00:10:21.428
right in the middle of this,
or near the middle.

00:10:21.428 --> 00:10:24.269
Magnetic interaction is much
weaker.

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:28.730
If you have two electron spins,
at the same distance from one

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.110
another, their energy is what?
 

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.793
One, two, three,
four, five orders of magnitude

00:10:35.793 --> 00:10:38.440
smaller, 10^5th smaller.
 

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.708
The "strong"
binding that holds a proton and

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:42.850
a neutron together is in the
deuterium nucleus,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:46.950
that is within the nucleus,
not at 1.54 Ångstroms,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:52.070
is 10^5th stronger than
Coulombic interaction.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:55.019
And gravity is ever so much
weaker.

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:58.836
If you had two carbon atoms,
that were at that distance,

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:02.028
the energy would be 10^-32
kilocalories/mol.

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:06.210
So forget gravity as a way of
holding things together.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:11.956
But then we have Coulombic up
or down by 5 orders of

00:11:11.956 --> 00:11:13.309
magnitude.
 

00:11:13.309 --> 00:11:16.548
Now what is a chemical bond;
how strong is it?

00:11:16.548 --> 00:11:20.888
A chemical bond is about -- the
carbon-carbon bond is about 90

00:11:20.888 --> 00:11:22.240
kilocalories/mol.
 

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.110
So not so far from the Coulomb
energy, from electrostatic

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.009
attraction.
 

00:11:27.009 --> 00:11:30.216
So maybe this hints that
electrostatic attraction has

00:11:30.216 --> 00:11:31.820
something to do with it.
 

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.548
But maybe not,
maybe it's something entirely

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:34.928
new.
 

00:11:34.928 --> 00:11:40.590
And we haven't talked about
kinetic energy.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.990
Does that have anything to do
with the strength of the bond?

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.269
So we'll get back to that later
on.

00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:51.707
Okay, so is there a chemical
force law, the thing that Newton

00:11:51.707 --> 00:11:53.038
was looking for?
 

00:11:53.038 --> 00:11:55.288
Now here's an interesting way
to phrase that.

00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:58.937
Suppose you had a chain of
atoms, a thread that was single

00:11:58.937 --> 00:12:02.840
atoms bonded to one another,
and you started stretching it.

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.668
It would stretch,
and at some point it would pop.

00:12:07.668 --> 00:12:11.206
Now let's just take three of
the atoms and we'll put stiff

00:12:11.206 --> 00:12:14.620
rods on the outer ones and we'll
start stretching it.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:22.182
So it'll stretch,
stretch, stretch,

00:12:22.182 --> 00:12:25.519
stretch, pop.
 

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:30.720
Now the question is how far do
you stretch it before it pops?

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.928
What determines how far you
stretch it before it pops?

00:12:34.928 --> 00:12:38.636
Okay, this must have to do with
the force law between atoms,

00:12:38.636 --> 00:12:42.029
which then will have to do with
molecular structure.

00:12:42.029 --> 00:12:44.958
So it could be like springs,
Hooke's law,

00:12:44.958 --> 00:12:47.009
Ut tensio,
sic vis.

00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:48.695
Okay, so the force is
proportional to the

00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:51.066
displacement,
and the energy to the square of

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:53.200
the displacement and the energy
then,

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.330
the potential energy,
is a parabola.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.770
We define zero when they're at
the standard,

00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.440
unstretched distance,
and then you stretch it or

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.620
compress it and the energy goes
up, like a parabola.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:10.440
Now the slope of that parabola
tells you what?

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:10.960
Student:  The force.
 

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.879
Prof: The force.
 

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:12.428
That's what's linear.
 

00:13:12.428 --> 00:13:17.009
As we stretch it further and
further, the slope gets bigger.

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:20.678
The force is proportional to
the displacement.

00:13:20.678 --> 00:13:24.932
Okay, now there could be other
kinds of force laws,

00:13:24.932 --> 00:13:28.928
like electrical charges,
Coulomb, or gravity.

00:13:28.928 --> 00:13:35.332
So that's a different force
law, inverse square force law,

00:13:35.332 --> 00:13:39.938
and the energy then is
proportional to the

00:13:39.938 --> 00:13:43.309
displacement,
in this way.

00:13:43.309 --> 00:13:43.408
So very different.
 

00:13:43.408 --> 00:13:47.035
Notice the zero of this one's
at the top when -- zero defined

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:48.850
when they're very far apart.
 

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:52.139
Here it's zero when they're at
the standard distance.

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:55.914
And so as you bring oppositely
charged particles together,

00:13:55.914 --> 00:13:59.226
the energy goes down
infinitely, as they get really

00:13:59.226 --> 00:13:59.889
close.
 

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:04.977
Okay, and now if we look at the
force here, as we go out the

00:14:04.977 --> 00:14:08.860
force gets smaller,
the slope gets smaller.

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:12.162
Now suppose you had a particle
that was connected to a spring

00:14:12.162 --> 00:14:14.364
on each side,
as in this chain that we're

00:14:14.364 --> 00:14:15.190
stretching.
 

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:19.803
And just to be general I made
the second string -- oh I say

00:14:19.803 --> 00:14:24.283
stronger, it's in fact weaker;
it doesn't go up as rapidly --

00:14:24.283 --> 00:14:25.960
I'll have to change that.
 

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.850
Okay now, but at some point the
slopes of the red and the blue,

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.293
at some distance,
some position,

00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:35.740
will be equal and opposite.
 

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.908
There.
 

00:14:37.908 --> 00:14:41.360
Okay, what's the force on the
central particle at that point?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.440
Students:  Zero.
 

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.210
Prof: Zero.
 

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:44.210
They balance.
 

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.857
So if we added those two
energies together to get the sum

00:14:49.857 --> 00:14:55.809
of the two, on this central
particle, it looks like that.

00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:58.360
So there's a balanced minimum.
 

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:02.222
There's a well defined position
where the particle in the center

00:15:02.222 --> 00:15:05.471
of this chain will just sit
there and it'll be hard to

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:06.269
displace.
 

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:07.759
So it can vibrate.
 

00:15:07.759 --> 00:15:09.629
Okay?
 

00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:11.070
Now how about in the other case?
 

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:14.407
How about if it were electrical
charges or gravity or something

00:15:14.407 --> 00:15:17.960
like that, an inverse square law
that's holding things together?

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.306
Then the second one is going to
look like that,

00:15:20.306 --> 00:15:22.038
and that one is indeed
stronger.

00:15:22.038 --> 00:15:25.619
So they're two flanking bodies
and we're interested in the

00:15:25.619 --> 00:15:27.879
position of the one in the
middle.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:31.567
And again, there'll be some
point where they balance,

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:34.051
right there,
where they're equal and

00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:35.470
opposite slopes.
 

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.370
How will this differ from the
first case?

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:42.803
Can you see what's going to
happen when we add these two

00:15:42.803 --> 00:15:43.889
together?
 

00:15:43.889 --> 00:15:46.399
Is it going to look more or
less like the one on the left?

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:47.798
Student: 
&gt;

00:15:47.798 --> 00:15:51.370
Prof: It's going to look
like that.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:55.440
And now there is no balanced
minimum in the middle.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:59.711
There's not a position where
the thing will just sit there,

00:15:59.711 --> 00:16:02.804
because it's always more
strongly affected,

00:16:02.804 --> 00:16:06.120
and attracted,
by the one it's closer to.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.631
There's some place where
there's zero force but it's not

00:16:09.631 --> 00:16:10.908
a stable position.
 

00:16:10.908 --> 00:16:15.288
Because if it displaces ever so
slightly, it'll keep on going.

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:19.303
So that one is a -- for the two
of them -- is a single minimum,

00:16:19.303 --> 00:16:21.570
and this one is a double
minimum.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:26.980
And for the people who came
early, there was a contest that

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.620
if you won it,
you could get an A in the

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.980
course, and the contest is this.
 

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:46.659
Here's a magnet, hanging here.
 

00:16:46.659 --> 00:16:55.529
And I'll stop it.
 

00:16:55.529 --> 00:17:00.075
Okay, and here are two magnets,
the ones that will flank that

00:17:00.075 --> 00:17:00.528
one.
 

00:17:00.528 --> 00:17:04.838
And if I get it just right,
it'll just sit there,

00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:08.788
the attraction to the two will
balance it.

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:22.108
So I'll put it on here,
and try to get my A.

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:28.289
So I'll get the string where it
would balance right there.

00:17:28.289 --> 00:17:44.910
Ah.
 

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:45.769
Okay?
 

00:17:45.769 --> 00:17:47.890
There is no stable position.
 

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:50.910
Nobody got their A that way.
 

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.538
Right?
 

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:57.375
Because it's an inverse law,
so it's always more strongly

00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:00.710
attracted to the closer thing.
 

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:05.768
So you can't win with that,
you can't get a balanced

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:06.858
position.
 

00:18:06.858 --> 00:18:10.210
Now I'm going to get these off
here.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:28.240
And back to the show.
 

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.053
So with springs you might be
able to make a stable polyatomic

00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:36.135
molecule from point atoms --
we saw a spring model before in

00:18:36.135 --> 00:18:40.845
the last lecture --
but you can't do it with ions

00:18:40.845 --> 00:18:44.720
and you can't do it with
magnets.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.826
However, Hooke's law can't do
it -- it can't be springs,

00:18:48.826 --> 00:18:51.440
because Hooke's law never
breaks.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.880
So we need a different kind of
force law.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:58.981
Does anybody know a force law
-- what it looks like -- the

00:18:58.981 --> 00:19:03.372
form of the force between atoms
or the energy for stretching a

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:04.019
bond?
 

00:19:04.019 --> 00:19:05.660
You ever seen a picture of such
a thing?

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:07.490
Student: 
&gt;

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.471
Prof: It's called the
Morse potential,

00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:12.130
or one form of it at least is
called the Morse potential.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:14.993
And it's not something
fundamental, it's not a law of

00:19:14.993 --> 00:19:15.490
nature.
 

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.770
It was thought up by a
physicist at Princeton in 1929,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.308
because it's mathematically
convenient;

00:19:21.308 --> 00:19:24.961
so you could solve quantum
mechanical problems if you used

00:19:24.961 --> 00:19:26.180
Morse potentials.
 

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.930
And the idea is this.
 

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:31.166
You have two neighbors and you
look at the position of the one

00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:34.192
on the right and it could be
there and the energy would be

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:36.940
minimum;
that's the bond distance, right?

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:39.430
And if you move it further to
the right, the energy goes up;

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.640
move it to the left,
the energy goes up.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.941
Okay, that's the Morse
potential, and we're just

00:19:43.941 --> 00:19:45.950
holding the neighbor on the left
fixed.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.194
Now we could put another
neighbor on the other side and

00:19:49.194 --> 00:19:51.480
have another curve of the same
sort;

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.288
stretching the second bond.
 

00:19:54.288 --> 00:19:57.864
Or we could have it be a chain
and have both neighbors there,

00:19:57.864 --> 00:20:01.380
and the sum of those two now
has a minimum in the middle.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.420
It's a single minimum,
like we got with Hooke's law.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:08.440
So that means that atom in the
middle would just stay there.

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.247
And now we're going to grab
those sticks on either side and

00:20:12.247 --> 00:20:14.019
pull the neighbors apart.
 

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:18.680
So if we pull them apart,
it's still a single minimum.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.131
And if we pull them apart
further, it's still a single

00:20:22.131 --> 00:20:24.410
minimum, although it's very
flat.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.943
And if we pull it further,
it pops and it becomes a double

00:20:28.943 --> 00:20:29.740
minimum.
 

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.390
And if we keep going the double
minimum gets more pronounced.

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:35.920
Now here's an interesting
question.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.996
At what point -- how far do you
have to stretch it before it

00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:40.480
pops?
 

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.400
That's the question we were
asking, right?

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:49.424
How can you look at those
curves and tell how far apart

00:20:49.424 --> 00:20:54.670
you have to stretch it before
the chain pops?

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.348
Shai?
 

00:20:55.348 --> 00:20:57.880
Student:  The bottom is
flat.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.384
So when the curve and the plot
was flat, then that's as far as

00:21:02.384 --> 00:21:05.811
it could go because --
Prof: What do you mean

00:21:05.811 --> 00:21:06.140
flat?
 

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.509
There's a name for a thing like
that in graphs.

00:21:08.509 --> 00:21:09.528
Student:  Inflection.
 

00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:10.980
Prof: It's the
inflection point.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.829
It's when the curvature changes
from being this way,

00:21:15.829 --> 00:21:19.157
like Hooke's law,
to being this way,

00:21:19.157 --> 00:21:20.108
right?
 

00:21:20.108 --> 00:21:24.308
So when the inflection points
cross, then the chain pops.

00:21:24.308 --> 00:21:27.273
Okay, so force laws are going
to make a lot of difference in

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:30.059
how atoms behave,
and if really knew the force

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:33.940
law we'd be in a great position
for understanding chemistry.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:38.662
It snaps at the inflection
point where it changes from a

00:21:38.662 --> 00:21:43.470
direct to an inverse dependence
on distance for force.

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:45.460
Okay, but what
are bonds?

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.997
Newton said,
"We'll look for the

00:21:46.997 --> 00:21:47.509
law."
 

00:21:47.509 --> 00:21:49.818
And it's sort of,
the law is sort of like Morse,

00:21:49.818 --> 00:21:51.118
but we don't know where it came
from,

00:21:51.118 --> 00:21:52.779
because we don't know how it
works,

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:54.338
we don't know what it really is.
 

00:21:54.338 --> 00:21:57.009
So can we find out what it
really is?

00:21:57.009 --> 00:22:02.970
Well in the nineteenth century
they discovered bonds.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.150
And this is a picture from
1861, we'll talk about this

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:06.630
later.
 

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:10.675
It's one of the first
depictions that's recognizable

00:22:10.675 --> 00:22:13.930
by people today of bonds between
atoms.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.413
So there are different numbers
of these lines,

00:22:17.413 --> 00:22:19.890
valences, for different atoms.
 

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.981
Hydrogen has one;
carbon has four;

00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:25.700
oxygen two; nitrogen three.
 

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.140
Why do the elements differ?
 

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.980
Why don't they all have the
same valence?

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:36.102
And even more complicated,
sometimes nitrogen is three and

00:22:36.102 --> 00:22:38.078
sometimes it's five.
 

00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:41.407
For example,
you have NH_3_ but

00:22:41.407 --> 00:22:45.403
you also have NH_4Cl,
where there are five things

00:22:45.403 --> 00:22:48.150
associated with the nitrogen.
 

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:50.160
So how do you understand the
valence?

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.150
That was the challenge for
people.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.548
They had figured out that there
was valence, but why?

00:22:56.548 --> 00:23:00.519
How could you predict the
valence of a new element?

00:23:00.519 --> 00:23:05.969
Well Gertrude and Robert
Robinson published a paper in

00:23:05.969 --> 00:23:11.109
1917 which showed this picture
of ammonia, NH_3.

00:23:11.109 --> 00:23:13.289
What's the loop?
 

00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:14.618
Pardon me?
 

00:23:14.618 --> 00:23:16.960
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.462
Prof: Someone said --
hold your hand up so that people

00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:20.089
can hear you.
 

00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:20.910
Okay yes.
 

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.259
Student:  A lone pair on
nitrogen.

00:23:22.259 --> 00:23:26.710
Prof: A lone pair on
nitrogen -- wrong.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:31.163
It looks like the lone pair on
nitrogen but the lone pair

00:23:31.163 --> 00:23:33.548
didn't come along that soon.
 

00:23:33.548 --> 00:23:36.681
What the loop means,
if you look at it in the

00:23:36.681 --> 00:23:40.240
context, is what makes NH_3_
reactive?

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.067
In this term,
this is what they wrote:

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:46.886
"It may reasonably be
assumed that the partial

00:23:46.886 --> 00:23:51.319
dissociation is a stage in the
complete process."

00:23:51.319 --> 00:23:52.818
So the bonds begin to break.
 

00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:57.565
This loop begins to break to
become a weaker loop and two

00:23:57.565 --> 00:24:01.038
other partial valences,
in this theory.

00:24:01.038 --> 00:24:05.821
And those valences begin to
associate with partial valences

00:24:05.821 --> 00:24:06.730
from HCl.
 

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:09.930
Right?
 

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.461
The loop is a
"latent"

00:24:12.461 --> 00:24:13.279
valence.
 

00:24:13.279 --> 00:24:15.640
You know what 'latent' means?
 

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.910
Latent is the opposite of
patent.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.470
Latent means hidden;
patent is revealed.

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.355
When you get a patent on
something it means that you tell

00:24:27.355 --> 00:24:30.445
everybody how to do it but the
government protects your right

00:24:30.445 --> 00:24:32.609
to do it for a certain period of
time.

00:24:32.609 --> 00:24:34.990
Latent means it's hidden.
 

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:37.805
So there's a hidden valence,
these loops,

00:24:37.805 --> 00:24:40.548
but they can become available,
right?

00:24:40.548 --> 00:24:43.202
It must be assumed in some
cases, as for example the

00:24:43.202 --> 00:24:45.700
combination of ammonia with
hydrochloric acid.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.329
Now, so you can get a reaction
and get the product,

00:24:49.329 --> 00:24:52.670
which has all five valences of
nitrogen now.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.180
But how do you know there's not
another loop on nitrogen,

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.207
that you could break open and
make it seven valent,

00:25:01.207 --> 00:25:03.058
or nine, or eleven?
 

00:25:03.058 --> 00:25:07.990
Or maybe you could break a loop
into three.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:11.843
So might latent valence loop
explain the trivalence and

00:25:11.843 --> 00:25:15.838
pentavalence of nitrogen,
or the amine-HCl reactivity?

00:25:15.838 --> 00:25:18.109
The trouble is it's too
slippery a concept.

00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:19.509
It explains everything.
 

00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:21.019
You could explain anything you
wanted to.

00:25:21.019 --> 00:25:23.950
You could explain eighty-four
valence of nitrogen or

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:24.640
something.
 

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.673
Anything that comes along,
you'd say, "Ah ha,

00:25:26.673 --> 00:25:28.500
there are that many latent
valences."

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.509
But how do you know there are
not more?

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:33.359
Why do you have latent valences?
 

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.858
When do you have them?
 

00:25:35.858 --> 00:25:38.548
When and why do you have
partial dissociation?

00:25:38.548 --> 00:25:43.132
This thing didn't explain
anything, or explained

00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:44.400
everything.
 

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:52.253
Now, at this point I want you
to smile so I can learn who you

00:25:52.253 --> 00:25:53.038
are.
 

00:25:53.038 --> 00:27:13.510
&lt;&lt;Professor McBride takes
pictures of the class

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:39.818
members&gt;&gt;
 

00:27:39.818 --> 00:27:44.970
Prof: So the electron
was discovered in 1897.

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.808
So maybe that has something to
do with it.

00:27:46.808 --> 00:27:50.643
And the guy who had associated
electrons with valence was

00:27:50.643 --> 00:27:51.670
G.N. Lewis.
 

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:59.430
And this is a picture of him as
a Harvard undergraduate in 1894.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.001
And this is eight years later,
when he was an instructor at

00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:05.115
Harvard,
and he then went to establish

00:28:05.115 --> 00:28:07.984
the Chemistry Department at the
University of California at

00:28:07.984 --> 00:28:08.529
Berkley.
 

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:09.220
Student:  Yay!
 

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:13.460
&gt;
 

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.940
Prof: But when he was at
Harvard in 1902 he used these

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.115
lecture notes,
and what he was trying to

00:28:21.115 --> 00:28:25.115
explain was the periodic table,
why you go across in eight and

00:28:25.115 --> 00:28:27.048
then another eight and another
eight,

00:28:27.048 --> 00:28:32.541
and so on, and why you have
electron transfers from some

00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:34.838
atoms to other atoms.
 

00:28:34.838 --> 00:28:40.301
And he said if the electrons in
an atom are arranged at the

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:43.728
corners of a cube,
then you -- eight is this very

00:28:43.728 --> 00:28:46.614
special number,
because that occupies all the

00:28:46.614 --> 00:28:48.108
corners of the cube.
 

00:28:48.108 --> 00:28:50.318
So if there's a desire,
for some reason,

00:28:50.318 --> 00:28:53.608
to complete octets,
then you can explain

00:28:53.608 --> 00:28:58.332
periodicity and see why some
atoms give up an electron to

00:28:58.332 --> 00:29:03.477
lose the outer shell and others
gain one to complete the outer

00:29:03.477 --> 00:29:04.490
shell.
 

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:09.251
Okay, so but it also could
explain how you get bonding,

00:29:09.251 --> 00:29:13.789
if you like to have octets;
not just electron transfer but

00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:15.970
the formation of covalent bonds.
 

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.440
So, for example,
here's two chlorines.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.460
Each has only seven;
the octet isn't complete.

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:26.999
But if you bring them together
and they share an edge,

00:29:26.999 --> 00:29:29.740
then both octets are complete.
 

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.411
He doesn't say
why octets should

00:29:32.411 --> 00:29:35.736
be so great, but if they're
octets then you could explain

00:29:35.736 --> 00:29:36.329
bonds.
 

00:29:36.329 --> 00:29:39.019
How about double bonds?
 

00:29:39.019 --> 00:29:42.740
Suppose you had two oxygen
atoms.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.569
What do you do now?
 

00:29:43.569 --> 00:29:44.839
Anybody see?
 

00:29:44.839 --> 00:29:45.710
What?
 

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.858
Student:  Put the faces
together.

00:29:46.858 --> 00:29:51.031
Prof: Put faces
together, share two edges,

00:29:51.031 --> 00:29:53.640
and then both have an octet.
 

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.580
Now, suppose you want to put
nitrogens together and form a

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.549
triple bond.
 

00:29:58.549 --> 00:30:00.349
Now how do you do it?
 

00:30:00.349 --> 00:30:02.910
Student:  Squish it.
 

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.259
Prof: Push it hard,
force it like a picture puzzle?

00:30:07.259 --> 00:30:07.910
Student:  Yes.
 

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:08.509
Prof: Put it in there.
 

00:30:08.509 --> 00:30:09.789
Student: You need to
push it.

00:30:09.789 --> 00:30:11.950
Student:  You did it.
 

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:15.390
Prof: It won't do it.
 

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.990
But about ten years later he
figured out how to do it.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:25.048
What you do is take the
electrons -- nitrogen has 5 --

00:30:25.048 --> 00:30:30.776
but instead of using an octet,
you contract it along opposing

00:30:30.776 --> 00:30:32.588
edges this way.
 

00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:35.598
So what was an octet,
what was a cube,

00:30:35.598 --> 00:30:36.819
becomes what?
 

00:30:36.819 --> 00:30:38.140
Student:  A tetrahedron.
 

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:41.308
Prof: A tetrahedron.
 

00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:46.031
And now if you take two
tetrahedra, you can put a face

00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:49.240
together and complete both
octets.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.200
But this wasn't such a great
development.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.374
He did this,
published this,

00:30:54.374 --> 00:30:55.180
in 1916.
 

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:58.593
But the tetrahedral
distribution of the bonds in

00:30:58.593 --> 00:31:03.022
carbon had been known by organic
chemists for 40 years by that

00:31:03.022 --> 00:31:07.021
time,
that the tetrahedron was a very

00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:09.240
important structure.
 

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.286
So a good theory should be
realistic and it should be

00:31:14.286 --> 00:31:15.160
simple.
 

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:18.048
But there's a tension between
these things.

00:31:18.048 --> 00:31:22.761
It should at least be as simple
as possible, but that may not be

00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:26.088
very simple;
that's why it takes us five

00:31:26.088 --> 00:31:26.680
weeks.
 

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:29.959
In regard to the facts it
should allow a number of

00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:30.829
properties.
 

00:31:30.829 --> 00:31:32.568
It should allow prediction.
 

00:31:32.568 --> 00:31:35.670
You should be able to say how
will these atoms react;

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.423
how will this molecule react;
what valence should nitrogen

00:31:39.423 --> 00:31:43.165
have;
how can it be both pentavalent

00:31:43.165 --> 00:31:44.880
and trivalent?
 

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:48.006
A little below this on the
scale of desirability is

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:48.818
suggestion.
 

00:31:48.818 --> 00:31:52.355
A theory may -- even if it
doesn't give you the proper

00:31:52.355 --> 00:31:56.558
thing, may at least suggest some
experiment that would be really

00:31:56.558 --> 00:31:57.558
good to do.
 

00:31:57.558 --> 00:32:03.422
Below that is explanation --
according to my theory all these

00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:08.501
known facts fit together,
but who knows about any new

00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:09.480
thing.
 

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:13.240
And lowest is classification
and remembering;

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.736
like Roy G. Biv allows you to
remember the colors of the

00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:20.358
spectrum, but there's nothing
fundamental about that.

00:32:20.358 --> 00:32:24.093
So even if you have a crummy
thing it might allow you to at

00:32:24.093 --> 00:32:27.440
least remember some facts and
organize them maybe.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.827
Okay, but those last two are
not prediction,

00:32:30.827 --> 00:32:34.211
they're post-diction;
you only use it to explain

00:32:34.211 --> 00:32:37.838
things that are already known as
a way of remembering them.

00:32:37.838 --> 00:32:41.955
So from the number of valence
electrons we'd like to predict

00:32:41.955 --> 00:32:45.722
how many atoms of different
types come together to form

00:32:45.722 --> 00:32:46.700
molecules.
 

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.420
That's constitution -- the
nature and the sequence of bonds

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.130
-- and the valence.
 

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.661
We'd like to know the structure
of molecules,

00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:57.788
the distance between atoms,
angles.

00:32:57.788 --> 00:33:00.798
We'd like to know how charge is
distributed within molecules.

00:33:00.798 --> 00:33:03.608
Are some regions positive and
others negative?

00:33:03.608 --> 00:33:05.630
We'd like to know what the
energy of the molecule is.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.957
Is this arrangement of the
atoms better or worse than an

00:33:08.957 --> 00:33:10.528
alternative arrangement?
 

00:33:10.528 --> 00:33:14.720
And we'd like to know about
reactivity.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.423
So Lewis explains constitution,
the nature and the sequence of

00:33:18.423 --> 00:33:18.910
bonds.
 

00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.170
"Nature"
means like single,

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.512
double, triple,
and "sequence"

00:33:23.512 --> 00:33:27.200
means which atoms are connected
to which.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:32.894
So he has electrons,
valence, and also he added

00:33:32.894 --> 00:33:35.000
unshared pairs.
 

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.779
So you count up how many,
from the atomic weight or the

00:33:37.779 --> 00:33:40.558
atomic number or the position in
the periodic table.

00:33:40.558 --> 00:33:44.044
You get how many valence
electrons, how many of these

00:33:44.044 --> 00:33:45.720
outer octets are there.
 

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:49.633
And then you can figure that
the valence of hydrogen should

00:33:49.633 --> 00:33:51.792
be one, boron three,
carbon four,

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:54.559
but then down again,
three, two, one.

00:33:54.559 --> 00:33:58.420
So here's ammonia, NH_3.
 

00:33:58.420 --> 00:34:00.410
It works fine and it has an
unshared pair.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:04.640
But why do you have octets?
 

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.440
Why not sextets?
 

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:13.389
And why do you have a pair for
hydrogen?

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:18.570
Why not an octet for hydrogen
also?

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:21.980
Okay, so let's just apply it to
HCN.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.905
So if carbon has four,
that makes possible a single

00:34:25.905 --> 00:34:29.360
bond to hydrogen,
a triple bond to carbon.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.989
Everybody has their octet
except hydrogen that only wants

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:33.380
two.
 

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:34.630
So everybody's happy.
 

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:38.050
And we can abbreviate it this
way, and leave the dot.

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:40.556
Lewis actually thought of
drawing a colon,

00:34:40.556 --> 00:34:43.309
a pair of dots,
to denote an unshared pair.

00:34:43.309 --> 00:34:45.530
So that's his notation.
 

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:47.730
So NH_3.
 

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:49.030
Bingo!
 

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.460
How about BH_3?
 

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:53.059
Just fine.
 

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:54.980
But here's something new.
 

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.277
The organic chemists would
already have known this,

00:34:57.277 --> 00:34:58.750
they knew the valence numbers.
 

00:34:58.750 --> 00:35:01.876
The electrons just added
something to it but didn't say

00:35:01.876 --> 00:35:03.150
anything really new.
 

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:09.166
But here's something new,
that BH_3_ reacts

00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:12.869
with NH_3, to give a new bond.
 

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:16.570
Now here's a puzzle.
 

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:23.380
It's also true that BH_3 reacts
with BH_3_.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:29.570
That doesn't look like
Lewis.

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.907
And the bond is reasonably
strong, it's half as strong as a

00:35:33.907 --> 00:35:35.480
carbon-carbon bond.
 

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.219
So what's the glue that holds
B_2H_6 together?

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:44.699
And we'll come back to that
fourteen lectures from now.

00:35:44.699 --> 00:35:45.579
But there's another thing.
 

00:35:45.579 --> 00:35:49.492
There's bookkeeping that you do
with Lewis structures to assign

00:35:49.492 --> 00:35:52.543
what's called formal charges;
not real charges,

00:35:52.543 --> 00:35:56.402
just what charges you write in
the formula, and you hope they

00:35:56.402 --> 00:35:57.559
mean something.
 

00:35:57.559 --> 00:36:01.213
And the bookkeeping scheme you
use is that each atom is

00:36:01.213 --> 00:36:04.260
assigned half interest in the
bonding pair.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:07.706
So if there's a bonding pair,
for bookkeeping purposes you

00:36:07.706 --> 00:36:09.518
assign one electron to each.
 

00:36:09.518 --> 00:36:13.474
It may be they aren't evenly
shared, but the bookkeepers

00:36:13.474 --> 00:36:14.409
don't care.
 

00:36:14.409 --> 00:36:16.514
Incidentally,
speaking of bookkeepers not

00:36:16.514 --> 00:36:19.365
caring,
there's -- people have had a

00:36:19.365 --> 00:36:23.518
lot of nonsense trying to get
signed up for lab,

00:36:23.518 --> 00:36:28.288
because the people who run the
system don't allow teachers to

00:36:28.288 --> 00:36:32.739
have access to the thing to see
the problems you face.

00:36:32.739 --> 00:36:35.340
So I have no way of telling --
I can't get on to your system.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.849
Has everybody figured out how
to sign up for lab by now?

00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:38.869
Student:  Yes.
 

00:36:38.869 --> 00:36:40.380
Prof: If anybody still
has problems,

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.416
after class Dr. DiMeglio can
take you to the computer center

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:44.550
here and help you.
 

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.969
So next year presumably it'll
be easier.

00:36:47.969 --> 00:36:49.840
This is a new system this year.
 

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:54.230
But anyhow, back to the
bookkeepers here.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.639
So these formal charges are not
necessarily real charges,

00:36:57.639 --> 00:37:01.110
they're just what you write
when you draw the formulas.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:06.047
Okay, so we split the BN
electrons between the B and the

00:37:06.047 --> 00:37:10.090
N, and we split the hydrogen
bonds as well.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:16.494
So nitrogen now has those four
electrons, where it brought five

00:37:16.494 --> 00:37:19.179
to the table originally.
 

00:37:19.179 --> 00:37:22.079
So it has a positive charge.
 

00:37:22.079 --> 00:37:26.079
Tetravalent nitrogen is
positive in the Lewis structure.

00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:27.320
Why?
 

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:31.425
Because in forming a fourth
bond, it gave up half-interest

00:37:31.425 --> 00:37:35.530
in one of its electron ,
the ones in the unshared pair.

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.922
So it lost a charge,
a negative charge,

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.369
and becomes positive.
 

00:37:39.369 --> 00:37:41.987
By the same token,
what else can you write in this

00:37:41.987 --> 00:37:42.630
structure?
 

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:45.030
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.969
Student:  It's negative.
 

00:37:45.969 --> 00:37:49.431
Prof: A negative charge
on boron, because it got

00:37:49.431 --> 00:37:51.099
half-interest in a pair.
 

00:37:51.099 --> 00:37:54.320
But that's just bookkeeping.
 

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.786
So when you write a Lewis
structure you'd write plus on

00:37:58.786 --> 00:38:01.269
nitrogen and minus on boron.
 

00:38:01.269 --> 00:38:02.929
Now is it real?
 

00:38:02.929 --> 00:38:07.324
Is there a positive charge on
nitrogen and negative charge on

00:38:07.324 --> 00:38:07.909
boron?
 

00:38:07.909 --> 00:38:12.641
Well we'll get later on to know
about what a surface potential

00:38:12.641 --> 00:38:13.030
is.
 

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:18.121
Surface potential is the energy
a proton would have if it was on

00:38:18.121 --> 00:38:21.679
different points on the
molecular surface.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:29.353
For this purpose you have to
define what the surface is of

00:38:29.353 --> 00:38:30.429
BNH_6.
 

00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:33.215
There's a way of doing that;
we won't talk about it now,

00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:34.590
that's jumping the gun.
 

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:39.018
But that's the surface,
and it's color coded to show

00:38:39.018 --> 00:38:44.056
the energy a proton would have
if it were on the surface at

00:38:44.056 --> 00:38:45.360
that point.
 

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.472
So what you see is that the
energy of the proton would be

00:38:49.472 --> 00:38:52.630
high, if it's here,
where it's very blue.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:58.251
The energy of the proton would
be low if it's in this region

00:38:58.251 --> 00:38:58.920
here.
 

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:01.659
Is that consistent with what we
were talking about?

00:39:01.659 --> 00:39:02.619
Student:  Yes.
 

00:39:02.619 --> 00:39:06.730
Prof: Where would a
proton be low in energy?

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:10.277
Where there's negative charge,
and it would be high in energy

00:39:10.277 --> 00:39:12.170
when there is positive charge.
 

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:15.789
So this molecule,
according to quantum mechanics,

00:39:15.789 --> 00:39:19.710
is positive on the left and
negative on the right.

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:23.077
And that's exactly what we
have, it's consistent with what

00:39:23.077 --> 00:39:23.670
we have.
 

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:27.699
And now Lewis also explains
where pentavalent nitrogen comes

00:39:27.699 --> 00:39:30.980
from, because there's an ionic
bond there too.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.760
Tetravalent nitrogen is plus.
 

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.257
So there's just a Coulombic
attraction between ammonium and

00:39:37.257 --> 00:39:38.110
chloride.
 

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:39.610
So that's a great contribution.
 

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:42.338
Now there are other things you
can understand in terms of Lewis

00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:42.909
structures.
 

00:39:42.909 --> 00:39:46.952
Like you have an amine and it
can react with an oxygen to give

00:39:46.952 --> 00:39:49.934
an amine oxide,
which is positive on nitrogen,

00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:51.460
negative on oxygen.
 

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:56.199
Or you can have a sulfide,
which can react with an oxygen,

00:39:56.199 --> 00:39:58.030
to give a sulfoxide.
 

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:02.121
Or what else can happen,
with a sulfur,

00:40:02.121 --> 00:40:05.460
what additionally can happen?
 

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.159
Student:  Another oxygen.
 

00:40:06.159 --> 00:40:09.126
Prof: It could do
another oxygen,

00:40:09.126 --> 00:40:11.940
and give a sulfone,
as it's called.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.110
So Lewis explains this.
 

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:19.159
So there are problems to drill
on Lewis structures.

00:40:19.159 --> 00:40:21.679
They're on the Web,
go look at them.

00:40:21.679 --> 00:40:26.130
One of them is draw Lewis dot
structures for HNC,

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:29.840
in that order,
H then N -- we did HCN;

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.389
but do HNC.
 

00:40:33.389 --> 00:40:38.369
And then try HCNO with CNO in
all six linear orders;

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:41.438
that is, nitrogen in the
middle, carbon in the middle,

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:44.215
oxygen in the middle,
and then hydrogen on either

00:40:44.215 --> 00:40:44.679
end.
 

00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:47.570
And it's also possible to make
a ring of CNO and put the

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.409
hydrogen on any of the
positions.

00:40:49.409 --> 00:40:54.010
So just practice drawing Lewis
structures of those.

00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:56.559
And start memorizing functional
groups.

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:59.155
We do precious little
memorizing in this course,

00:40:59.155 --> 00:41:01.639
compared to most organic
chemistry courses.

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:05.137
We try to figure out how things
work so that you can predict

00:41:05.137 --> 00:41:06.559
without memorizing it.
 

00:41:06.559 --> 00:41:08.896
But there are some things you
have to know,

00:41:08.896 --> 00:41:10.400
like the names of groups.
 

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.619
Otherwise it takes forever to
talk about them.

00:41:12.619 --> 00:41:15.579
So here are the ones you have
to learn,

00:41:15.579 --> 00:41:18.764
and on the fist exam,
coming up in three weeks or

00:41:18.764 --> 00:41:21.490
whatever,
I'll give you a question where

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.159
you have to draw one of these
structures from the name,

00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:27.380
or give the name for a
structure.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.762
These are all on the webpage;
you don't have to copy them

00:41:29.762 --> 00:41:30.000
down.
 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.820
But those are simple functional
groups.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.349
&gt;
 

00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:37.340
And here are -- whoops,
oh there you go,

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.159
sorry.
 

00:41:38.159 --> 00:41:40.559
&gt;
 

00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:42.179
There.
 

00:41:42.179 --> 00:41:44.690
They're also conjugated
functional groups.

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.570
So you could run it yourself.
 

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.679
Okay, now the final question
here, for today,

00:41:51.679 --> 00:41:54.630
is a thing that comes up when
you talk about Lewis structures,

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:57.639
or structures in general,
Lewis structures in particular,

00:41:57.639 --> 00:41:59.730
is equilibrium and resonance.
 

00:41:59.730 --> 00:42:02.119
How many people know what
resonance is?

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:06.900
What is it?
 

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:10.215
Student:  Like the same
molecule but different

00:42:10.215 --> 00:42:10.980
structure.
 

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.268
Prof: Speak up a little
bit.

00:42:12.268 --> 00:42:15.043
Student:  It's the same
molecule but a different

00:42:15.043 --> 00:42:15.659
structure.
 

00:42:15.659 --> 00:42:17.550
Prof: The same molecule
but a different structure.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.300
But isn't structure a molecule?
 

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:23.139
Student: But with that I
guess --

00:42:23.139 --> 00:42:25.436
Prof: You know like,
let me just interject a minute

00:42:25.436 --> 00:42:25.719
here.
 

00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:29.840
Like, one of the problems is
HCNO in any order.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:32.621
So there would be different
molecules with C in the middle,

00:42:32.621 --> 00:42:34.300
N in the middle,
O in the middle.

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.550
Is that what you mean?
 

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.719
Student:  No.
 

00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:39.980
I mean like it's -- if you have
a double or a triple bond,

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.469
it's in a different location,
it's around the central atom.

00:42:43.469 --> 00:42:47.358
Prof: Ah,
now let's -- actually resonance

00:42:47.358 --> 00:42:51.989
is one of those things where
people try to hide ignorance

00:42:51.989 --> 00:42:53.480
from ignominy.
 

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.920
And let me show you what I mean
by that.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.690
So here's the structure for
HCNO.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.940
And here it has all octets.
 

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.449
If you go through you'll figure
that out.

00:43:04.449 --> 00:43:08.369
It has charge separation though.
 

00:43:08.369 --> 00:43:10.460
You don't like to have that in
your structures.

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:14.030
You like not to have charges if
you can avoid it.

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:19.230
Obviously in BNH_6 you can't
avoid it.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.324
Okay, now but you can get rid
of the charge separation by

00:43:22.324 --> 00:43:25.420
shifting that electron pair
that's on oxygen to be shared

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:29.045
between oxygen and nitrogen;
then you don't have the charge

00:43:29.045 --> 00:43:30.219
on oxygen anymore.
 

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:31.300
Everybody see that?
 

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.469
Student:  Yeah sure.
 

00:43:32.469 --> 00:43:34.639
Prof: What's the problem
when you do that?

00:43:34.639 --> 00:43:38.570
Nitrogen now has too many
electrons.

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:43.697
So you could shift a pair from
-- that's in the CN bond,

00:43:43.697 --> 00:43:47.800
onto the carbon,
in your drawing you make.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:53.614
Okay, so you get this structure
shown below which has all

00:43:53.614 --> 00:43:54.550
octets.
 

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.318
But there's still charge
separation, and in fact it's

00:43:58.318 --> 00:44:02.157
worse because the negative
charge, instead of being on

00:44:02.157 --> 00:44:04.260
oxygen, is now on carbon.
 

00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.527
So there are these two
different Lewis structures you

00:44:07.527 --> 00:44:11.237
can draw and each has its own
properties, or good things and

00:44:11.237 --> 00:44:12.179
bad things.
 

00:44:12.179 --> 00:44:17.577
Now what are the geometric
implications of there being two

00:44:17.577 --> 00:44:18.809
structures?
 

00:44:18.809 --> 00:44:22.559
It could mean that in the
middle one, in the lower one,

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:26.240
nitrogen is exactly halfway
between carbon and oxygen,

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.949
because they are both double
bonds.

00:44:28.949 --> 00:44:31.929
But in the top one,
nitrogen is much closer to

00:44:31.929 --> 00:44:33.518
carbon than to oxygen.
 

00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:39.949
That could be the meaning of
this.

00:44:39.949 --> 00:44:44.510
So that if you draw a picture
of the energy,

00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:48.630
as a function of the position
of the nitrogen,

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.409
you could get two different
structures,

00:44:51.409 --> 00:44:54.289
one where it's further to the
left,

00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:57.190
where the nitrogen is further
to the left you have this

00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:59.675
structure,
and when the nitrogen's in the

00:44:59.675 --> 00:45:01.579
middle you have that structure.
 

00:45:01.579 --> 00:45:04.860
And you have to go up hill in
energy, it'll click;

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.449
as you start pushing the
nitrogen it starts,

00:45:07.449 --> 00:45:09.739
it'll click,
and it's the other one.

00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:11.289
Okay?
 

00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:15.130
That could be the way the atoms
really behave.

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:20.268
That's called a double minimum;
we already saw a double minimum

00:45:20.268 --> 00:45:21.018
today.
 

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:24.809
But maybe in truth it's not
this way.

00:45:24.809 --> 00:45:28.909
Maybe it's a single minimum.
 

00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:33.313
Maybe the best position for the
nitrogen is neither to the left

00:45:33.313 --> 00:45:35.869
nor in the middle,
but in between;

00:45:35.869 --> 00:45:39.550
maybe that's the lowest energy.
 

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:42.929
And that is what resonance is.
 

00:45:42.929 --> 00:45:47.561
Resonance is when you -- the
true structure is in between the

00:45:47.561 --> 00:45:49.260
structures you draw.
 

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:54.820
So really what it is,
is a failure of the notation.

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:59.510
Does everybody see how that's
so?

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.474
It's that the notation you use
doesn't show the right

00:46:03.474 --> 00:46:07.286
structure, and when that happens
there's said to be

00:46:07.286 --> 00:46:11.182
"resonance";
although actually all it is is

00:46:11.182 --> 00:46:13.925
that the true structure is a
single minimum,

00:46:13.925 --> 00:46:17.559
not the double minimum you'd
expect from your drawing.

00:46:17.559 --> 00:46:20.639
It's a failure of the way you
draw.

00:46:20.639 --> 00:46:25.123
And notice that for resonance
you use a double headed arrow

00:46:25.123 --> 00:46:28.139
whereas if I back up a second
here --

00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:30.219
equilibrium,
when you have a double minimum,

00:46:30.219 --> 00:46:34.480
there are two arrows,
two different structures.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.639
So the question is which is it?
 

00:46:36.639 --> 00:46:39.699
Is the real molecule a double
minimum;

00:46:39.699 --> 00:46:43.188
or the real molecules a double
minimum, are there two

00:46:43.188 --> 00:46:44.059
structures?
 

00:46:44.059 --> 00:46:47.730
Or is there in truth only one
structure?

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:49.150
So you need to choose.
 

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:53.440
The choice between whether
there's resonance or equilibrium

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.581
must be based on experimental
facts or on a theory that's

00:46:57.581 --> 00:47:02.166
better than Lewis's theory,
to be able to know which is

00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:04.637
true;
something that can distinguish

00:47:04.637 --> 00:47:07.210
between a single and a double
minimum.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:11.137
So equilibrium is two arrows,
and there are two structures

00:47:11.137 --> 00:47:14.585
that go back and forth,
and resonance is a single

00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:17.657
structure,
that our notation isn't very

00:47:17.657 --> 00:47:19.039
good at drawing.
 

00:47:19.039 --> 00:47:24.117
So two real species,
or one real species but two

00:47:24.117 --> 00:47:30.601
reasonable formulas we could
draw for it, or that Lewis would

00:47:30.601 --> 00:47:32.329
draw for it.
 

00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:38.818
So really what it is,
resonance is a failure of

00:47:38.818 --> 00:47:45.025
simplistic notation,
and it's associated with

00:47:45.025 --> 00:47:48.130
unusual stability.
 

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:55.771
Now when I say 'unusual,' that
implies that you know what usual

00:47:55.771 --> 00:47:57.619
stability is.
 

00:47:57.619 --> 00:48:01.369
So compared to what is it
unusual?

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:05.280
And we'll address that question
later on.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.068
So let me just give you finally
an example of equilibrium versus

00:48:10.068 --> 00:48:10.980
resonance.
 

00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:13.559
So this, as you'll learn when
you learn functional groups,

00:48:13.559 --> 00:48:16.483
is a carboxylic acid,
and you could have the hydrogen

00:48:16.483 --> 00:48:19.800
attached to this oxygen or it
could be attached to the other

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:20.420
oxygen.
 

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.429
So these are not just the same
thing upside down.

00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:25.827
It's the hydrogen being
attached to one or being

00:48:25.827 --> 00:48:28.019
attached to the other of the two
oxygens.

00:48:28.019 --> 00:48:31.030
And, in fact, it is that way.
 

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:34.092
There are two structures and
you go back and forth between

00:48:34.092 --> 00:48:39.360
them;
two species.

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:43.106
But how about if you take the
hydrogen atom away and have this

00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:45.440
thing that's called a free
radical,

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.018
where you don't have a complete
octet on this oxygen?

00:48:49.018 --> 00:48:52.449
There are only two,
four, six, seven electrons

00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:53.059
there.
 

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:56.030
It has the ability to form
another bond by sharing an

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.659
electron.
 

00:48:56.659 --> 00:49:00.710
Is that two different species?
 

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:05.829
Or is it one species -- watch
-- with an intermediate geometry

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:10.360
where you don't really have
double and single bonds but

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.460
something in between?
 

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.610
And how do you know which it is?
 

00:49:14.610 --> 00:49:18.030
The only way is to do some
experiment that tells you.

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:21.434
And there is an experiment that
tells you it's only one nuclear

00:49:21.434 --> 00:49:22.039
geometry.
 

00:49:22.039 --> 00:49:25.331
And we don't have time in the
last thirty seconds to tell you

00:49:25.331 --> 00:49:27.721
how that proof works,
but I'll tell you that the

00:49:27.721 --> 00:49:29.492
technique is electron
paramagnetic resonance

00:49:29.492 --> 00:49:31.139
spectroscopy
&gt;

00:49:31.139 --> 00:49:36.581
, shows that in truth,
although this is two species,

00:49:36.581 --> 00:49:38.929
this is one species.
 

00:49:38.929 --> 00:49:42.170
So there's equilibrium at the
top and resonance at the bottom.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:45.827
And if you add an extra
electron to make a carboxylate

00:49:45.827 --> 00:49:49.898
anion, infrared spectroscopy
tells you that it's symmetrical

00:49:49.898 --> 00:49:50.449
too.
 

00:49:50.449 --> 00:49:52.699
There's resonance in this case.
 

00:49:52.699 --> 00:49:55.130
It's an intermediate structure.
 

00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:58.659
But that is "lore."
 

00:49:58.659 --> 00:50:01.230
You didn't predict that from
Lewis structure ahead of time.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.974
It could've been either way,
and in fact there were many

00:50:03.974 --> 00:50:06.420
people who thought it was one
way or the other.

00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:08.789
It's only experiment that does
it.

00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:11.869
So, next time we'll talk more
about lore.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.530
Professor John Rogers:
In the poem that we looked

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.530
at last time -- that was the
poem "Ad Patrem" that Milton had

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.930
addressed to his father --
Milton was attempting,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.130
as you remember,
to justify to his father his

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.705
own interest in becoming a poet.
And so I'm going to ask you to

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.312
turn back to "Ad Patrem."
This is page eighty-three of

00:00:18.312 --> 00:00:21.226
the Hughes edition.
This is where Milton is

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:26.250
accounting for himself in his
choice of a poetic career.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.151
In the second verse paragraph,
Milton tells his father:

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:41.330
"do not despise divine poetry,
creation of the prophetic bard.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.382
Nothing better shows our
heavenly origins,

00:00:44.382 --> 00:00:47.062
our divine seed,
our human intellect,

00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:50.190
those holy traces of Promethean
fire."

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.680
And look a little further down
in the same paragraph.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.280
Milton continues his defense of
what he calls the poet's task.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.765
Poets are not only due the
highest respect imaginable here

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.150
on earth, Milton's explaining to
his dad.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.730
Poets are rewarded as well in
heaven.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.357
And so Milton writes (this is
page eighty-three):

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:15.258
"And when we return to our
native Olympus" -- and in a

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:18.324
classically oriented poem such
as this a phrase like "our

00:01:18.324 --> 00:01:21.498
native Olympus" would always
serve to signify the Christian

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.935
heaven.
[And w]hen we return to

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:27.000
our native Olympus and the
everlasting ages of immutable

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.886
eternity are established,
we [and he means "we poets"]

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:35.539
shall walk, crowned with gold,
through the temples of the

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.276
skies and with the harp's soft
accompaniment we shall sing

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:45.012
sweet songs to which the stars
shall echo and the vault of

00:01:45.012 --> 00:01:48.819
heaven from pole to pole.
Unbelievable.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.295
Now Milton –
and he's being serious here,

00:01:51.295 --> 00:01:53.986
and we are given every
rhetorical cue possible that

00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:58.132
Milton is being serious –
has conjured one of the most

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:01.849
extraordinary rewards
conceivable for a poet.

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:06.421
Forget the paltry crown of
laurel placed atop the heads of

00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.870
great writers in the classical
tradition.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.460
What good is that going to do
you?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.430
Milton is actually talking
about heaven here.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.467
And the reward for the poet's
sacrifice here on earth is not

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:25.590
simply eternal fame that had
long been a privileged image.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.810
It's a priority status in the
great hereafter.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.443
This is Milton's argument.
And if heaven is going to be

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.919
segregated, as Milton seems to
believe it would be,

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:38.851
into hierarchies and classes,
then surely poets would enjoy

00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.849
the privileges of the highest
class of all as they "walk,

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.776
crowned with gold,
through the temples of the

00:02:45.776 --> 00:02:49.500
skies" and "with the harp's soft
accompaniment…

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.251
sing sweet songs."Now we
have to ask: where could Milton

00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:57.150
have come by such an idea as
this?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.230
This image of a special reward
in heaven for certain types of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.379
behavior does of course have
some sort of scriptural basis,

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.259
but there's certainly nothing
in the Bible to suggest that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.729
it's poets who are issued the
crowns of gold and,

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.870
especially, a prominent place
as they enter the pearly gates.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.529
And so often,
and this is something that

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.348
we'll get very used to here,
Milton is incorporating into

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:27.166
his own text a biblical text on
a subject almost entirely

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:31.189
different from the one of his
own idiosyncratic poem.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.903
And as so often Milton has no
choice but to wrench and to

00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:40.954
violate the biblical text to
force it to say what he wants it

00:03:40.954 --> 00:03:43.881
to say,
or to force it to say what he

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:47.677
needs it to say.Now this
allusion here in this verse

00:03:47.677 --> 00:03:51.335
epistle to his father is to a
passage from the book of

00:03:51.335 --> 00:03:54.307
Revelation.
Milton's alluding to what he

00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:58.175
took to be the divinely inspired
prophesy of Saint John the

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.710
Divine that ends the New
Testament.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.901
I've put this on the handout.
This is from chapter 14 of the

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:08.264
book of Revelation.
…I heard the voice

00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:10.560
of harpers harping with their
harps:

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.348
And they sung as it were
a new song before the

00:04:12.348 --> 00:04:14.366
throne…
and no man could learn that

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:16.180
song.
[I've skipped a little bit.]

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.468
but the hundred and forty and
four thousand,

00:04:18.468 --> 00:04:20.810
which were redeemed from the
earth.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.310
These are they which were
not defiled with women;

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.553
for they are virgins.
So according to John,

00:04:29.553 --> 00:04:32.620
the presumed author of
Revelation, it's not

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.710
poets who get to wed
their songs to the soft voice

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.335
streams.
It's not poets who are crowned

00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:42.629
with gold as they learn the song
no other men could learn.

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.550
These are honors reserved
exclusively for virgins,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.610
honors reserved only for those
who do not defile themselves

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.088
with the sins of the flesh.
And so it's as if something in

00:04:55.088 --> 00:04:59.627
the figurative world of Milton's
poem to his father has -- I

00:04:59.627 --> 00:05:03.608
don't know, how do we put it?
-- has gone awry and unless

00:05:03.608 --> 00:05:06.420
we're willing to concede,
and we're probably not,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.743
that all poets are necessarily
male virgins,

00:05:09.743 --> 00:05:14.071
you can pretty much safely say
that there's a significant

00:05:14.071 --> 00:05:17.858
disjunction here between
Milton's own text and the

00:05:17.858 --> 00:05:19.978
passage,
the text in the book of

00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:21.560
Revelation, that he's alluding
to.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.688
This is an opportunity for us
-- this is what I get paid to do

00:05:25.688 --> 00:05:28.259
and what you're getting credit
[laughs]

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.504
for learning to do –
it's this type of signifying

00:05:32.504 --> 00:05:37.408
gap that compels us as literary
critics to dive in and to begin

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:40.810
to explore.So the first
question is,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.839
how do we understand the
slippage here from the biblical

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:52.540
virgin to the Miltonic poet --
and more generally,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.315
what could poetry
possibly have to do with

00:05:56.315 --> 00:05:59.801
virginity?
I hope you remember from the

00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:03.712
Sixth Elegy, the Sexta
Elegia, that we read a few

00:06:03.712 --> 00:06:08.193
classes ago that Milton had told
his friend Charles Diodati that

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:11.819
an aspiring epic poet should
only drink water;

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.410
two, should refrain from eating
meat;

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.379
and three, should keep his body
chaste.

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:20.924
And the figure of the poetic
rewards for chastity continues

00:06:20.924 --> 00:06:24.449
to surface throughout Milton's
early works.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.020
You remember the "Letter to a
Friend" that we looked at for

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.688
the last time.
Milton seemed to have decided

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:33.201
against marriage as he was
making the decision to wed

00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:38.106
himself to his poetry instead.
And in the group of poems that

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:43.816
were assigned for a section last
week, you saw Milton alluding to

00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:47.484
just this passage,
although you might not have

00:06:47.484 --> 00:06:51.205
known it, in Revelation 14
whenever he would speak of the

00:06:51.205 --> 00:06:54.608
music of the spheres.
So in "At a Solemn Music" and

00:06:54.608 --> 00:06:57.851
in the poem "Arcades,"
Milton turns to what he

00:06:57.851 --> 00:07:01.468
considered to be the greatest
song of all: the music of the

00:07:01.468 --> 00:07:05.393
heavenly spheres.
And he indicated that there are

00:07:05.393 --> 00:07:10.088
only a few just men -- just,
honorable men -- who can even

00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:15.061
hear those celestial notes.
It would appear that Milton's

00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:19.720
suggesting that it's chastity
that actually establishes

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.724
something like a precondition
for hearing and learning that

00:07:24.724 --> 00:07:29.987
inspired song that's actually
sung before the throne of God in

00:07:29.987 --> 00:07:33.298
Revelation.
So true poetry for Milton,

00:07:33.298 --> 00:07:36.478
true prophetic poetry,
the kind of song that can

00:07:36.478 --> 00:07:40.470
actually vie with the most
perfect music of the spheres,

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.000
is only accessible,
and presumably only producible,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.889
by the virgin.Now we can't
neglect the first question here,

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:54.870
which is at least for me:
did Milton really believe this?

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.972
Could Milton actually have
believed that poetic success was

00:07:57.972 --> 00:08:00.699
in some way contingent on what
it is that you do,

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.160
or what it is you don't do,
with your body?

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.129
And obviously we don't have him
here.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:10.522
Who knows the degree of honesty
that he would bring to our

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:14.868
question if he were here?
We can never know the answer to

00:08:14.868 --> 00:08:18.490
the question of Milton's actual
beliefs;

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:23.158
but we know how Milton wanted
to represent those

00:08:23.158 --> 00:08:27.134
youthful beliefs,
which is exactly what he does

00:08:27.134 --> 00:08:32.235
in the prose treatise with the
wonderful title An Apology

00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:34.309
[for]
Smectymnuus.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:35.490
Don't be put off by the
name.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.608
Smectymnuus is a made-up
name, though Milton didn't make

00:08:39.608 --> 00:08:42.194
it up.
It's an acronym comprised of

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:45.349
the initials of five
Presbyterian ministers,

00:08:45.349 --> 00:08:46.999
which,
when combined,

00:08:46.999 --> 00:08:50.110
forms the name -- it almost
sounds obscene --

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.291
Smectymnuus.So the
Apology [for]

00:08:53.291 --> 00:08:56.190
Smectymnuus was written in
1642.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.980
It's about eight years after
Comus.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.255
I know we haven't gotten to
Comus yet,

00:09:00.255 --> 00:09:02.480
but I'm trying to put this in
to context.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.336
In this pamphlet,
this prose treatise,

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:10.122
Milton is looking back at this
exuberant affection for the very

00:09:10.122 --> 00:09:14.059
idea of chastity that he had
held in his youth.

00:09:14.059 --> 00:09:17.365
You'll note -- and there's no
reason you need to read more of

00:09:17.365 --> 00:09:20.451
this, but the Hughes edition
only includes a small

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:24.196
portion of the actual pamphlet.
So this treatise as a whole is

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:27.889
Milton's defense of these six
Presbyterian ministers who wrote

00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:31.279
a treatise criticizing the
authoritarian structure of the

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:34.666
English church.
Milton was also at this time

00:09:34.666 --> 00:09:39.019
becoming an opponent of the
Anglican church government,

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:43.517
and he was writing and
publishing attacks on the church

00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:47.764
alongside those of the
Smectymnuus group.Now the

00:09:47.764 --> 00:09:52.845
Church of England establishment
always countered these puritan

00:09:52.845 --> 00:09:56.509
treatises in attack of their
position.

00:09:56.509 --> 00:10:00.642
In a particularly vicious
critique of so-called

00:10:00.642 --> 00:10:05.044
Smectymnuus,
an anonymous Anglican opponent

00:10:05.044 --> 00:10:09.806
attacked not only these six
Presbyterian ministers but

00:10:09.806 --> 00:10:15.022
attacked Milton as well.
I think this might be the first

00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:18.379
time that John Milton is
actually attacked or brought to

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:21.309
the attention of the English
people in print.

00:10:21.309 --> 00:10:24.311
So we have this anonymous
attacker who dismisses Milton's

00:10:24.311 --> 00:10:28.458
earlier political treatises,
especially The Reason of

00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:32.690
Church Government and other
early works.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.793
He dismisses Milton in an
unscrupulous ad hominem

00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:39.917
attack.
He argued that this John Milton

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:43.870
fellow simply couldn't be heeded
on matters of the church,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.234
or on matters of the state,
because Milton himself had

00:10:48.234 --> 00:10:52.410
absolutely no moral authority.
He accused Milton of

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.107
frequenting playhouses,
and also of frequenting .

00:10:56.107 --> 00:10:56.570
.
.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:03.879
bordellos.
We ask ourselves, "Milton?!

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:06.779
Our John Milton frequent a
bordello?!"

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:10.949
You must agree with me that
although Milton may have had

00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:14.210
some wayward,
bordello-oriented thoughts,

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:19.200
there is no way in hell that
this unspeakably self-controlled

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.190
young man would actually find
himself in a whorehouse.The

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.164
accusation is absurd,
and Milton knew it was absurd,

00:11:28.164 --> 00:11:30.500
but he loves the attack
nonetheless.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.872
You can tell he does because it
gives him this extraordinarily

00:11:33.872 --> 00:11:37.409
happy opportunity of defending
himself and justifying himself,

00:11:37.409 --> 00:11:41.071
which is what he does with a
special vigor -- this is on page

00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:44.000
695 of the Hughes -- in
the Apology.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.312
Milton explains the
preposterous of the idea that he

00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:50.618
has ever visited a prostitute.
In fact, he claims,

00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:54.462
he was so far from such
debauchery that he had devoted

00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:58.669
his entire early life to the
ideal of virginity.

00:11:58.669 --> 00:12:02.730
Now Milton knows that this
might sound a little silly

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:06.408
coming from a young man.
And he acknowledges here

00:12:06.408 --> 00:12:10.254
finally that the ideal of
virginity is an ideal for which

00:12:10.254 --> 00:12:14.032
women are typically
praised -- and of course this

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:18.056
goes without saying.
In patriarchal societies there

00:12:18.056 --> 00:12:22.437
tends to be an inordinate degree
of interest placed on the

00:12:22.437 --> 00:12:27.436
virginity of young women.
It matters more for women than

00:12:27.436 --> 00:12:30.576
for men.
It's as if the commodity of the

00:12:30.576 --> 00:12:34.855
bride is deemed truly valuable
only if it can be guaranteed

00:12:34.855 --> 00:12:39.281
pure and untouched.Milton
recognizes that way of thinking

00:12:39.281 --> 00:12:42.154
as a double standard,
and he isn't satisfied with

00:12:42.154 --> 00:12:45.605
this vulgar double standard;
so he comes up with a vulgar

00:12:45.605 --> 00:12:50.291
double standard of his own.
This is the argument:

00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:56.429
Since men are clearly what he
calls "the perfecter sex,"

00:12:56.429 --> 00:12:59.973
surely they should be held to
even higher standards of bodily

00:12:59.973 --> 00:13:03.622
purity even than women.
So given the elevated status of

00:13:03.622 --> 00:13:07.898
men, it's all the more important
that men should remain

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:11.246
pure and chaste.
And so we have Milton arguing

00:13:11.246 --> 00:13:15.210
-- this is on the top of page
695 and I'm quoting here:

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.801
[I]f unchastity in a
woman, whom St.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:21.530
Paul terms the glory of man,
be such a scandal and dishonor,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.291
then certainly in a man,
who is both the image and glory

00:13:25.291 --> 00:13:28.440
of God, it must,
though commonly not so thought,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.529
be much more deflowering and
dishonorable;

00:13:31.529 --> 00:13:33.814
in that he sins both against
his own body,

00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:36.490
which is the perfecter sex,
and his own glory,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.200
which is in the woman,
and that which is worst,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.380
against the image and glory of
God,

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:45.264
which is in himself.
Nor did I slumber over that

00:13:45.264 --> 00:13:49.378
place [and he's referring to
that text in the Bible that we

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:52.641
just looked at]
expressing such high rewards of

00:13:52.641 --> 00:13:57.038
ever accompanying the Lamb with
those celestial songs to others

00:13:57.038 --> 00:14:00.562
inapprehensible,
but not those who were not

00:14:00.562 --> 00:14:04.158
defiled with women...
Now the place in the Bible over

00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:07.125
which Milton couldn't slumber
was obviously the passage from

00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:10.526
Revelation 14.
It has to be said that the

00:14:10.526 --> 00:14:15.620
young Milton lost a lot of sleep
over this passage.

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.546
Milton, we know,
was seriously looking forward

00:14:18.546 --> 00:14:22.513
-- or we have to assume he was
seriously looking forward -- to

00:14:22.513 --> 00:14:25.960
high rewards in heaven as a
virgin and as a poet.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.869
He would hear and sing those
songs to others inapprehensible,

00:14:30.869 --> 00:14:34.286
the celestial music.
We can see that Milton astutely

00:14:34.286 --> 00:14:37.468
exploits -- it's brilliant --
the sexist implications of Saint

00:14:37.468 --> 00:14:41.113
John's treatment of virginity.
For both John of the book of

00:14:41.113 --> 00:14:45.234
Revelation and for John Milton,
it's the superior male of the

00:14:45.234 --> 00:14:49.286
species that's been singled out
for the glorious practice of

00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:53.820
sexual abstinence.Now this
passage that we're looking at,

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.801
the passage from the
Apology, has been

00:14:55.801 --> 00:14:57.648
written, well,
after all of the poems that

00:14:57.648 --> 00:15:00.348
we're reading for today.
Milton is writing here from a

00:15:00.348 --> 00:15:03.275
slightly different -- we can
think of it as a more mature --

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:05.448
perspective.
So in 1642, you see Milton

00:15:05.448 --> 00:15:08.031
softening a bit,
in part because he's interested

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.878
in getting married himself and,
in fact he's married within a

00:15:11.878 --> 00:15:15.289
month of the actual publication
of this treatise.

00:15:15.289 --> 00:15:18.573
This is why he tells us
parenthetically that marriage

00:15:18.573 --> 00:15:23.421
must not be called a defilement.
He's beginning to change his

00:15:23.421 --> 00:15:25.835
mind.
But at the time period that we

00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:28.465
are examining,
the period in which he writes

00:15:28.465 --> 00:15:30.771
Comus,
the early 1630s,

00:15:30.771 --> 00:15:35.015
Milton seems very much
interested in remaining virginal

00:15:35.015 --> 00:15:38.500
forever,
avoiding even the sanctioned

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:43.179
loss of virginity which is the
state of marriage.

00:15:43.179 --> 00:15:49.146
Milton's college nickname as he
tells us in the Prolusion Six --

00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:54.638
this is a college exercise --
Milton's college nickname was

00:15:54.638 --> 00:15:57.939
the Lady.
Now it's true that Milton's

00:15:57.939 --> 00:16:01.465
skin -- and he tells us this
innumerable times,

00:16:01.465 --> 00:16:06.140
and it's vouched by others --
his skin was very fair and he to

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.820
an unusual degree wore his hair
quite long.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.053
He must have had,
it is conjectured,

00:16:12.053 --> 00:16:14.990
a rather ladylike appearance as
a young man.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.680
But I suspect that it was
primarily Milton's intense

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.166
interest in his college years in
his own virginity that led our

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:26.639
young poet's classmates at
Christ's College,

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:32.994
Cambridge to call him The Lady
of Christ's.It's too easy --

00:16:32.994 --> 00:16:38.938
and you know where I'm going
with this -- it's too easy but

00:16:38.938 --> 00:16:45.293
it's also too delicious
to take this little biographical

00:16:45.293 --> 00:16:50.930
fact of Milton's college
nickname and use it in some way

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:55.440
as a tool for reading A
Mask.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.723
This is a brief theatrical
piece that Milton writes in 1634

00:16:59.723 --> 00:17:03.746
and which he publishes in 1637.
The heroine of the masque,

00:17:03.746 --> 00:17:05.825
as you know,
doesn't seem to have a

00:17:05.825 --> 00:17:09.529
Christian name.
She's not Britney or Lindsay.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:13.758
We're only asked to think of
her as the Lady,

00:17:13.758 --> 00:17:16.679
by her title.
And while it would be

00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:20.907
ridiculous for us to read the
entire masque as the poet's own

00:17:20.907 --> 00:17:24.430
completely unfettered
autobiographical fantasy,

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:28.437
there is clearly -- and this is
undeniable -- a Miltonic set of

00:17:28.437 --> 00:17:32.381
interests and a Miltonic set of
anxieties charging and fueling

00:17:32.381 --> 00:17:36.389
this work.But first we need
to establish a few things about

00:17:36.389 --> 00:17:39.880
the occasion for this piece and
about the genre,

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:41.640
the literary genre of the
masque in general.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.208
Milton's masque was the
product of a commission and as

00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:48.479
its full title suggests -- A
Mask Presented at Ludlow

00:17:48.479 --> 00:17:51.512
Castle -- it was
commissioned to be performed at

00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:54.435
a specific locale,
obviously, Ludlow Castle,

00:17:54.435 --> 00:17:57.068
which is in the west of
England, still there,

00:17:57.068 --> 00:18:00.180
near Wales -- on the border of
England and Wales,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:04.721
and this piece was performed
only once on the religious

00:18:04.721 --> 00:18:09.215
holiday of Michelmas night.
Now the theatrical form of the

00:18:09.215 --> 00:18:13.052
masque differs in a number of
ways from the more familiar

00:18:13.052 --> 00:18:17.471
dramatic form of the play,
with which we're all obviously

00:18:17.471 --> 00:18:20.972
much more comfortable with.
In the first place,

00:18:20.972 --> 00:18:23.890
a masque is nearly
always occasional.

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:27.662
It's nearly always commissioned
by the king to be performed at

00:18:27.662 --> 00:18:30.940
court before a private audience
of select nobility,

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:34.527
or it's commissioned -- as in
the case of this masque -- it's

00:18:34.527 --> 00:18:38.115
commissioned by an aristocratic
family to be performed at the

00:18:38.115 --> 00:18:41.883
aristocratic family's estate to
honor or to celebrate a specific

00:18:41.883 --> 00:18:44.798
occasion.
And so in the case of A Mask

00:18:44.798 --> 00:18:48.703
here, it's the Lord John
Egerton, the Earl of Bridgewater

00:18:48.703 --> 00:18:52.349
who commissioned Milton to write
a piece honoring his own

00:18:52.349 --> 00:18:55.734
inauguration in his new role as
the Lord President of

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:59.575
Wales.So Milton wrote this
masque with a specific

00:18:59.575 --> 00:19:02.569
cast and a specific audience in
mind.

00:19:02.569 --> 00:19:06.537
He wrote it to be performed by
Bridgewater's three children:

00:19:06.537 --> 00:19:09.564
the Lady Alice,
who obviously played the Lady,

00:19:09.564 --> 00:19:12.119
and Bridgewater's two sons
–

00:19:12.119 --> 00:19:15.417
they're John and Thomas -- and
they play the Elder Brother and

00:19:15.417 --> 00:19:17.309
the second brother,
respectively.

00:19:17.309 --> 00:19:21.889
Alice is fifteen years old at
the time, not an entirely

00:19:21.889 --> 00:19:26.976
unreasonable age for an actress
or an amateur actress playing

00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:31.980
the maidenly but strong-headed
Lady of Milton's masque.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.915
But her brothers were -- and
this is a little sillier -- her

00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:39.650
brothers were eleven and nine:
unusually young actors,

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:41.665
we might think,
to be engaged in such

00:19:41.665 --> 00:19:44.801
high-flying philosophical
debates as these two characters

00:19:44.801 --> 00:19:49.377
find themselves in.
Whatever awkwardness of casting

00:19:49.377 --> 00:19:54.785
we have in this original
performance we'll cast that

00:19:54.785 --> 00:19:57.207
aside.
We have no choice but to

00:19:57.207 --> 00:20:00.141
understand that Milton's
masque is serious

00:20:00.141 --> 00:20:03.380
business.The whole
production is one of the utmost

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.103
seriousness.
The music for the masque,

00:20:06.103 --> 00:20:09.589
which still exists at least,
the melody still exists,

00:20:09.589 --> 00:20:12.289
was written by Henry Lawes,
the most important musician

00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:14.912
working in England.
He had just come from writing

00:20:14.912 --> 00:20:18.003
the music for a number of
masques by the celebrated

00:20:18.003 --> 00:20:20.390
playwright and masque-writer Ben
Johnson.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.395
It seems that Lawes himself
actually played the role of the

00:20:23.395 --> 00:20:25.797
attendant spirit,
that beneficent,

00:20:25.797 --> 00:20:31.378
slightly frightening figure who
hovers over the entire landscape

00:20:31.378 --> 00:20:34.892
of the masque.
Now it's been conjectured

00:20:34.892 --> 00:20:38.498
-- this is for 100 or 150 years
now -- that the actor playing

00:20:38.498 --> 00:20:41.984
Comus in this first and only
performance in the seventeenth

00:20:41.984 --> 00:20:45.410
century was none other than our
John Milton himself.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:50.437
I am quite sure that there are
no historical grounds whatsoever

00:20:50.437 --> 00:20:55.465
for this conjecture other than
our perfectly perverse desire to

00:20:55.465 --> 00:20:59.149
imagine the young,
self-described virginal Milton

00:20:59.149 --> 00:21:01.997
uttering the wanton and
absolutely beautifully

00:21:01.997 --> 00:21:04.720
lascivious speeches of the
magician and,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.170
of course, would-be molester
Comus.

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.538
And who could deny the
satisfaction of hearing our

00:21:12.538 --> 00:21:15.391
buttoned-up young Milton
[laughs]

00:21:15.391 --> 00:21:20.205
speaking one of Comus'
magnificently sly and suggestive

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:24.306
lines such as -- with all that
false innocence:

00:21:24.306 --> 00:21:28.140
"What hath night to do with
sleep?"

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:31.130
he asks -- Comus asks -- the
Lady.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:36.027
As excited -- as aroused -- as
we might find ourselves by this

00:21:36.027 --> 00:21:39.640
imagining of Milton actually
playing Comus,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.744
of course his performance in
that role can't be asserted in

00:21:43.744 --> 00:21:47.000
any way definitively.Now as
I mentioned,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.968
the title of this piece was
originally A Mask Presented

00:21:50.968 --> 00:21:54.509
at Ludlow Castle,
 and it seems actually

00:21:54.509 --> 00:21:58.323
to have been known by the
reading public by this title for

00:21:58.323 --> 00:22:01.820
a good hundred years or so.
But at some point in the

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.492
eighteenth century,
the masque seemed

00:22:04.492 --> 00:22:07.349
informally to acquire an
alternative title,

00:22:07.349 --> 00:22:10.930
Comus, and it's as
Comus that all readers since

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.690
have almost always referred to
the masque -- and this,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.570
of course, is a mistake.
It's a misnomer,

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:22.584
but the historical
transmutation of Milton's title

00:22:22.584 --> 00:22:27.752
we have to take as instructive.
So I want to propose that the

00:22:27.752 --> 00:22:33.011
literary traditions' renaming of
this piece from A Mask to

00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:36.380
Comus is more than just a
slip,

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.380
or more than just a random
shift of terms or of names.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:45.849
On the face of things,
to call this masque Comus

00:22:45.849 --> 00:22:49.740
is absurd.
Comus is obviously the villain.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.820
And for those of you who have
read Paradise Lost,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:55.529
you'll notice that the
characterization of Comus

00:22:55.529 --> 00:22:58.397
prepares Milton in a lot of
important ways for his much

00:22:58.397 --> 00:23:01.160
later characterization of the
character Satan.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.630
Comus and Satan are both
seductive.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.628
They're both rhetorically
gifted tempters,

00:23:06.628 --> 00:23:11.017
and they actually share a lot
of rhetorical figures and moral

00:23:11.017 --> 00:23:14.180
concerns in common.
At times when we read

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:18.411
Paradise Lost it seems
almost as if Satan were quoting

00:23:18.411 --> 00:23:21.019
or alluding to Comus.But
it's,

00:23:21.019 --> 00:23:25.819
of course, the Lady
who's the heroine of this piece.

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:31.027
If we were asked to refer to
the masque by the name of

00:23:31.027 --> 00:23:34.692
one of its characters,
I think we'd feel obliged to

00:23:34.692 --> 00:23:37.912
call it The Lady,
or maybe The Trials and

00:23:37.912 --> 00:23:41.359
Tribulations of the Lady or
The Ultimate Triumph of the

00:23:41.359 --> 00:23:45.307
Lady -- something like that,
and we would name the masque

00:23:45.307 --> 00:23:49.083
after the Lady because it's
she who represents the moral and

00:23:49.083 --> 00:23:52.680
doctrinal message that the
masque itself espouses.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:00.402
The Lady is at the dogmatic
heart of this relentlessly

00:24:00.402 --> 00:24:07.104
didactic work of
literature.What did I just

00:24:07.104 --> 00:24:08.270
say?

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:36.148
Did I say that the Lady is at
the dogmatic heart of this

00:24:36.148 --> 00:24:40.220
relentlessly didactic work of
literature?

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.521
Is it possible to say that the
Lady successfully -- does that

00:24:44.521 --> 00:24:47.670
make any sense?
Is it possible to say that she

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:51.208
successfully conveys a moral
program that we can any way

00:24:51.208 --> 00:24:54.490
identify as the official
doctrine of the masque?

00:25:04.289 --> 00:25:07.318
The casual renaming of the
masque, which happened

00:25:07.318 --> 00:25:10.589
well after Milton's death,
suggests that readers have been

00:25:10.589 --> 00:25:13.713
perhaps less persuaded by the
moral vision relayed by the

00:25:13.713 --> 00:25:16.600
Lady,
and that they've been perhaps

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.059
overly persuaded by the subtle
temptations of Comus.

00:25:21.059 --> 00:25:24.576
And this confusion,
I think, has everything to do

00:25:24.576 --> 00:25:28.898
with the fact that this is no
ordinary moral that we have in

00:25:28.898 --> 00:25:33.009
this work of literature.
The focus of the masque

00:25:33.009 --> 00:25:37.604
is the loaded -- you'll
grant me this -- and the always

00:25:37.604 --> 00:25:42.269
awkward subject of chastity.
The actual morality of the kind

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:45.690
of chastity that the Lady
believes in, I think,

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:51.055
raises a lot of questions about
the clarity of the distinction

00:25:51.055 --> 00:25:54.750
being formed here between good
and evil.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:59.261
So I'm partially going to
retract what I had said about

00:25:59.261 --> 00:26:04.190
the Lady's place at the very
heart of this work.Okay.

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:12.751
Look at line 205,
page ninety-five in the

00:26:12.751 --> 00:26:17.778
Hughes.
We're treated to the Lady's

00:26:17.778 --> 00:26:22.061
singular investment in the
integrity of her body in her

00:26:22.061 --> 00:26:25.080
first speech.
Of course, the Lady is alone.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.907
Why is she alone?
Because her brothers have

00:26:26.907 --> 00:26:29.779
naturally done what any brother
would do accompanying a sister

00:26:29.779 --> 00:26:33.702
in a dangerous forest at night.
They have abandoned her to pick

00:26:33.702 --> 00:26:37.072
berries or any such cooling
fruit as the kind,

00:26:37.072 --> 00:26:39.680
hospitable woods provide.
[laughs]

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.829
Dr.
Samuel Johnson,

00:26:40.829 --> 00:26:43.765
the greatest of all
eighteenth-century literary

00:26:43.765 --> 00:26:47.148
critics, is absolutely
flabbergasted that Milton would

00:26:47.148 --> 00:26:50.339
have these brothers do something
so stupid.

00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:53.566
It's so dark in the woods all
alone that the Lady can

00:26:53.566 --> 00:26:57.008
see nothing.
But nonetheless she can

00:26:57.008 --> 00:27:02.028
hear the riot and
ill-managed merriment of Comus

00:27:02.028 --> 00:27:06.198
and his riotous crew.
And I'm going to ask you to

00:27:06.198 --> 00:27:10.507
think of all of the images here,
the figurations of listening

00:27:10.507 --> 00:27:14.907
and hearing in the masque.
The Lady is overwhelmed not by

00:27:14.907 --> 00:27:18.460
what she can't see but by what
she can hear:

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.877
 A thousand fantasies
Begin to throng into my

00:27:30.877 --> 00:27:35.509
memory, Of calling shapes
and beck'ning shadows dire,

00:27:35.509 --> 00:27:39.759
And airy tongues that syllable
men's names

00:27:39.759 --> 00:27:46.460
On Sands and Shores and desert
Wildernesses.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:51.051
Now I submit that the Lady
would appear to be less in

00:27:51.051 --> 00:27:55.732
control of her fantasies than
she is of her rigorously

00:27:55.732 --> 00:27:58.987
disciplined behavior.
However unyielding her

00:27:58.987 --> 00:28:01.653
dedication to her virginity,
and we have to say that it's

00:28:01.653 --> 00:28:04.158
unyielding,
the Lady is incapable of

00:28:04.158 --> 00:28:07.069
disciplining utterly her
imagination.

00:28:07.069 --> 00:28:11.256
And the rudeness and swill
insolence of Comus' band of evil

00:28:11.256 --> 00:28:15.731
pranksters are almost matched --
perhaps they're even bested --

00:28:15.731 --> 00:28:19.701
by the uncontrollable shapes
that throng into the Lady's

00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:23.632
memory.
It's almost as if the Lady were

00:28:23.632 --> 00:28:27.299
in some way harboring her own
demons.

00:28:27.299 --> 00:28:30.630
It's as if we have an instance
here of what –

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.415
{this is an idea that I got
from the Milton lecture that I

00:28:34.415 --> 00:28:36.740
took when I was a sophomore
here;

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.628
my professor suggested that
this is an instance of what) --

00:28:40.628 --> 00:28:43.779
Freud would call the return of
the repressed.

00:28:43.779 --> 00:28:47.933
As the Lady labors to preserve
her virginity,

00:28:47.933 --> 00:28:53.126
she conjures a menacing but
nonetheless sensual image of

00:28:53.126 --> 00:28:58.130
"airy tongues that syllable
men's names."Now,

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.460
being the Lady,
she pulls her socks up.

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:04.388
She quickly recovers from this
brief lapse, a momentary lapse,

00:29:04.388 --> 00:29:07.653
into sensual reverie.
She addresses all of those

00:29:07.653 --> 00:29:10.260
virtues that she cherishes so
highly.

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:14.536
Look at line 213: 
O welcome pure-ey'd

00:29:14.536 --> 00:29:18.259
Faith, white-handed Hope,
Thou hov'ring Angel girt with

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:21.201
golden wings,
And thou, unblemish't form of

00:29:21.201 --> 00:29:23.630
Chastity,
I see ye visibly,

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.922
and now believe
That he, the Supreme good,

00:29:26.922 --> 00:29:30.585
t' whom all things ill
Are but as slavish officers of

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:32.898
vengeance,
Would send a glist'ring

00:29:32.898 --> 00:29:37.445
Guardian, if need were,
To keep my life and honor

00:29:37.445 --> 00:29:40.809
unassailed.
This lady doesn't need the --

00:29:40.809 --> 00:29:42.309
who cares where her brothers
are?

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:46.316
-- she doesn't need their
protection because God prizes

00:29:46.316 --> 00:29:50.693
chastity above all things and
would gladly send a glistering

00:29:50.693 --> 00:29:53.809
guardian to keep her honor
unassailed.

00:29:53.809 --> 00:30:00.491
Now we might agree that this is
a reasonable enough fantasy of

00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:04.274
female invulnerability,
but of course,

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:08.450
there is nothing in our sad
experience with sexual menace

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.999
that actually bears the theory
behind this fantasy out.But

00:30:12.999 --> 00:30:16.727
think of how the Lady has
expressed this sentiment:

00:30:16.727 --> 00:30:19.331
"O welcome,
pure-ey'd Faith,

00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:23.193
white-handed Hope,
/ And thou, unblemish't form of

00:30:23.193 --> 00:30:30.510
Chastity…"
Faith, hope and chastity.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:37.099
Do we read this right?
You may recognize the allusion.

00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:41.074
The allusion here is obviously
to the passage in 1 Corinthians

00:30:41.074 --> 00:30:43.420
that you can find on your
handout.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.740
This is one of the most famous
verses in the Christian Bible.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.918
Saint Paul enumerates what we
now call the cardinal virtues:

00:30:51.918 --> 00:30:55.165
"And now abideth faith,
hope, charity,

00:30:55.165 --> 00:30:59.252
these three;
but the greatest of these is

00:30:59.252 --> 00:31:01.234
charity."
Now we're not,

00:31:01.234 --> 00:31:05.039
of course, surprised by Paul's
list of the virtues.

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:08.488
Charity, or what he seems to
have been thinking of as the

00:31:08.488 --> 00:31:12.160
selflessness of Christian love,
is a virtue generous and

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:16.400
capacious enough to encompass
all of the others -- but faith,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:20.527
hope and chastity?
"And the greatest of these is

00:31:20.527 --> 00:31:24.067
chastity"--?!?
It's as if in some way we're

00:31:24.067 --> 00:31:28.058
being invited to measure the
Lady's speech against the

00:31:28.058 --> 00:31:32.500
scriptural text that supplies
its rhetorical foundation.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.631
And I think it's impossible not
to see that when Milton

00:31:35.631 --> 00:31:38.588
substitutes [laughs]
the virtue charity with the far

00:31:38.588 --> 00:31:41.430
more circumscribed -- however
virtuous it is,

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:44.941
it's the much more
circumscribed -- ideal of

00:31:44.941 --> 00:31:47.125
chastity.
There's something at least a

00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:50.361
little peculiar going on.
The Lady, it could be said,

00:31:50.361 --> 00:31:54.066
appears to overvalue her
chastity, and it's in the

00:31:54.066 --> 00:31:58.074
general overvaluation of
chastity that we can best see

00:31:58.074 --> 00:32:02.486
the ways in which this text,
Comus, begins to burst

00:32:02.486 --> 00:32:06.119
loose of the orthodox Christian
morality that we tend to

00:32:06.119 --> 00:32:09.621
associate with pious Christian
literature like this --

00:32:09.621 --> 00:32:13.651
especially the literature of the
masque.Now it's the Elder

00:32:13.651 --> 00:32:17.880
Brother in the masque who
offers us an even more -- if you

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.712
can imagine it -- even more
magnified view of the virtue of

00:32:21.712 --> 00:32:24.721
virginity.
The Lady herself had argued

00:32:24.721 --> 00:32:27.785
that heaven would send a
glistering guardian down to

00:32:27.785 --> 00:32:31.209
defend her physical -- her
bodily -- integrity or physical

00:32:31.209 --> 00:32:33.831
innocence.
But the Elder Brother goes

00:32:33.831 --> 00:32:37.507
further even than that.
And it's his theory of the

00:32:37.507 --> 00:32:42.003
rewards due virginity that
really just flings this masque

00:32:42.003 --> 00:32:46.178
far from the reaches even of
anything even resembling

00:32:46.178 --> 00:32:49.390
mainstream protestant orthodoxy
or,

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:51.880
for that matter,
orthodoxy of any kind.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:57.732
This is the Elder Brother,
line 453, page 100 in the

00:32:57.732 --> 00:33:03.700
Hughes, chatting with his
younger brother:

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:05.789
So dear to Heav'n is
Saintly chastity,

00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:08.740
That when a soul is found
sincerely so,

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.519
A thousand liveried Angels
lackey her,

00:33:11.519 --> 00:33:14.819
Driving far off each thing of
sin and guilt,

00:33:14.819 --> 00:33:18.797
And in clear dream and solemn
vision Tell her of things

00:33:18.797 --> 00:33:23.049
that no gross ear can hear,
Till oft converse with heav'nly

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:25.914
habitants..
And Milton, or the Elder

00:33:25.914 --> 00:33:27.991
Brother here,
is clearly thinking of

00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:30.947
Revelation 14,
in which it's only the pure

00:33:30.947 --> 00:33:35.346
spirit -- or the virgin -- that
can even begin to hear the new

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:38.519
song being sung before the
throne of God.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.529
The Elder Brother is explaining
that these angels will:

00:33:41.529 --> 00:33:44.958
Begin to cast a beam on
th'outward shape, The

00:33:44.958 --> 00:33:49.266
unpolluted temple of the mind,
And turns it by degrees to the

00:33:49.266 --> 00:33:56.380
soul's essence,
Till all be made immortal.

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.991
It was one thing for the Lady
to imagine -- you know,

00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:03.046
crazy as it was,
for the Lady to imagine -- a

00:34:03.046 --> 00:34:07.352
rescue squad of angels to zip to
her aid at the first hint of a

00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:11.289
physical assault.
And it was okay for Saint John

00:34:11.289 --> 00:34:15.813
to suggest that virgins are
granted the best perquisites in

00:34:15.813 --> 00:34:17.574
eternity.
But think of what the Elder

00:34:17.574 --> 00:34:20.706
Brother has just given us.
He's staged a scenario far

00:34:20.706 --> 00:34:24.610
beyond the wildest theological
conjectures.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.026
As the critic William Kerrigan
has helped us to understand,

00:34:27.026 --> 00:34:29.235
the Elder Brother is arguing
that so dear to heaven is

00:34:29.235 --> 00:34:31.651
saintly chastity that heaven
doesn't even permit virgins to

00:34:31.651 --> 00:34:33.999
die.
The thousand liveried angels

00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:37.747
begin to cast their special beam
on the virgin's outward shape --

00:34:37.747 --> 00:34:40.914
that's her body,
the unpolluted temple that

00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:44.694
houses her virginal mind.
This angelic laser begins

00:34:44.694 --> 00:34:48.487
slowly the gradual process in
some kind of extraordinary

00:34:48.487 --> 00:34:52.695
science-fiction sort of way of
transforming the virginal human

00:34:52.695 --> 00:34:55.730
body to the essence of the soul
itself.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.284
It's as if this celestial laser
beam were designed so as to

00:35:00.284 --> 00:35:04.681
actually shift the atomic
structure of the pure corporeal

00:35:04.681 --> 00:35:09.550
frame of the virgin's body until
that body is so rarefied,

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:16.710
so pure and ethereal,
that it's nothing but soul.

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:22.670
She's been transmogrified from
body to soul.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:28.498
She's safe!Now never mind
that our own experience with

00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:34.327
virgins has failed to afford us
such a spectacle of bodily

00:35:34.327 --> 00:35:37.483
transformation.
The Elder Brother is issuing

00:35:37.483 --> 00:35:39.086
this theory without any
consideration,

00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:42.067
obviously,
whatsoever of earthly reality

00:35:42.067 --> 00:35:46.820
and we're shocked by -- I don't
know how else to put it.

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:50.341
Because this is a theological
conjecture, I think we're

00:35:50.341 --> 00:35:54.124
shocked by what is almost the
heretical daring of what this

00:35:54.124 --> 00:35:56.845
brother has just said.
Unfortunately,

00:35:56.845 --> 00:35:59.847
your editor,
Merritt Hughes -- and in this

00:35:59.847 --> 00:36:04.460
respect he's like all editors of
Milton -- does his very best to

00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:08.780
tame the outrageousness of the
Elder Brother's speech.

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:12.350
He follows the old editorial
wisdom that holds that Milton

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.670
can't possibly mean what he's
actually saying here.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:19.510
Hughes tells us that Milton's
thinking of Plato and that the

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:23.220
Elder Brother is referring to
the platonic theory that the

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.800
noble spirit is released from
the body after death.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.691
But -- and this will be our
mantra, I hope,

00:36:29.691 --> 00:36:33.684
for the rest of this semester
-- we must not permit Merritt

00:36:33.684 --> 00:36:37.608
Hughes or any Milton editor to
prevail in their efforts at

00:36:37.608 --> 00:36:41.050
papering over the implications
of a passage such as

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.856
this.There is,
of course, no mention

00:36:43.856 --> 00:36:46.614
whatsoever here of a soul being
released from a body after

00:36:46.614 --> 00:36:48.849
death.
That would be an entirely

00:36:48.849 --> 00:36:53.170
orthodox image and we wouldn't
be startled by its presence.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.512
But what the Elder Brother is
saying is that the virginal body

00:36:56.512 --> 00:36:58.650
is actually transmogrified into
soul.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:02.379
The dirty business of physical
death never has to take place at

00:37:02.379 --> 00:37:05.265
all.
True virginity can provide the

00:37:05.265 --> 00:37:10.401
body with the release even from
that seemingly inexorable fact

00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:14.354
of death.Well,
we're prepared in no way to

00:37:14.354 --> 00:37:17.994
respond meaningfully to a speech
such as that,

00:37:17.994 --> 00:37:22.605
and clearly the second brother
joins us in his bafflement:

00:37:22.605 --> 00:37:25.760
[laughs]
the magnificent non sequitur

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.129
that he gives [laughs]
in response to the speech of

00:37:30.129 --> 00:37:35.603
his brother's.
The second brother says at line

00:37:35.603 --> 00:37:40.500
475: "How charming is divine
Philosophy!"

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.855
The Elder Brother has obviously
upped the ante in the

00:37:43.855 --> 00:37:46.760
masque's overvaluation of
virginity.

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:50.572
It's possible that in this
general drama of overvaluation

00:37:50.572 --> 00:37:54.589
that Milton's working -- just
because this whole thing is so

00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:58.675
extreme -- to distance himself
from his own youthful interest

00:37:58.675 --> 00:38:03.139
in the virtues of virginity.
That's one conjecture at least.

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:06.948
There seems to be something
like a gentle parody,

00:38:06.948 --> 00:38:11.036
maybe even a mocking tone,
that fills the lines of the

00:38:11.036 --> 00:38:14.285
Elder Brother's ecstatic
speech.In any case,

00:38:14.285 --> 00:38:18.225
the question of value and
valuation is an important one in

00:38:18.225 --> 00:38:21.365
Comus,
 and it's important in

00:38:21.365 --> 00:38:25.353
part because the rhetoric of the
masque is saturated in

00:38:25.353 --> 00:38:27.280
the economic,
the commercial,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.804
and the financial imagery that
we were looking at in the last

00:38:30.804 --> 00:38:33.670
lecture.
Milton we know -- we know this

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.331
already -- gives pride of place
to the images of money and trade

00:38:38.331 --> 00:38:41.070
that he inherited from his
father;

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.893
and so we're not surprised that
the central conflict in Comus

00:38:45.893 --> 00:38:49.798
is loaded with the
rhetorical tokens of commerce

00:38:49.798 --> 00:38:54.590
and exchange.
Look at line 679 of the poem.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:58.582
This is page 106 in the
Hughes. Comus is

00:38:58.582 --> 00:39:03.183
marshaling a series of serious
and perfectly ingenious

00:39:03.183 --> 00:39:07.349
arguments in his attempt to
seduce the Lady,

00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:10.516
which is really simply an
attempt, ostensibly,

00:39:10.516 --> 00:39:14.739
to get her to drink from the
glass of cordial julep which she

00:39:14.739 --> 00:39:18.490
has steadfastly refused.
"Drink up though," he tells her.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:21.960
And this is line 679: 
Why should you be so

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.044
cruel to yourself,
And to those dainty limbs which

00:39:25.044 --> 00:39:28.750
nature lent
For gentle usage and soft

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.931
delicacy?
But you invert the cov'nants of

00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:34.964
her trust,
And harshly [to nature's trust]

00:39:34.964 --> 00:39:39.290
deal like an ill borrower
With that which you receiv'd on

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:43.050
other terms…
"So nature has lent you your

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.848
dainty limbs for a purpose,"
Comus tells her,

00:39:45.848 --> 00:39:49.409
"but you're inverting the
covenant of nature's trust,

00:39:49.409 --> 00:39:53.082
refusing to use and to spend
those gifts that nature has

00:39:53.082 --> 00:39:55.166
given you."
According to Comus,

00:39:55.166 --> 00:39:57.469
the Lady is an ill
borrower.

00:39:57.469 --> 00:40:02.835
She doesn't spend her bodily
wealth and fulfill the terms of

00:40:02.835 --> 00:40:06.359
nature's loan.
And so for Comus,

00:40:06.359 --> 00:40:12.812
the Lady is hoarding the
natural asset of her physical

00:40:12.812 --> 00:40:18.210
beauty.
Look down further, line 739.

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:22.350
"Beauty is" -- Comus continues: 
Beauty is nature's coin,

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:25.300
must not be hoarded,
But must be current [in

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:29.623
currency], and the good thereof
Consists in mutual and partak'n

00:40:29.623 --> 00:40:35.451
bliss,
Unsavory in th'enjoyment of

00:40:35.451 --> 00:40:39.330
itself.
With this phrase,

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:43.318
"mutual and partak'n bliss," we
develop an overwhelming sense

00:40:43.318 --> 00:40:47.307
that Comus seems to be trying to
get the Lady to do something

00:40:47.307 --> 00:40:51.096
more simply than drink a sip of
the cordial julep from his

00:40:51.096 --> 00:40:54.474
charmed cup.
The discussion is obviously in

00:40:54.474 --> 00:40:57.645
some way really about sex,
and it's the Lady's

00:40:57.645 --> 00:41:00.675
virginity,
of course, that's at stake

00:41:00.675 --> 00:41:03.055
here.
With this accusation of the

00:41:03.055 --> 00:41:06.530
misuse of borrowed funds,
we recognize the strange and,

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.135
I think in this context,
rather ill-fitting subtext

00:41:10.135 --> 00:41:14.172
behind Comus' seduction.
Comus is adopting the language

00:41:14.172 --> 00:41:18.423
from that parable in Matthew
(Matthew 25) that had proven so

00:41:18.423 --> 00:41:21.522
significant and,
I think, so painful for the

00:41:21.522 --> 00:41:24.809
young Milton.
For Comus, nature is just like

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:28.787
the harsh master who had given
each of his servants a portion

00:41:28.787 --> 00:41:31.440
of money and who expects those
coins,

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:36.190
who expects those talents,
to be put to use.

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:39.582
The Lady's talent has to be
spent -- it has to be invested

00:41:39.582 --> 00:41:42.855
-- in order to fulfill the
covenant of the trust between

00:41:42.855 --> 00:41:47.026
the master and the servant.
But the Lady is hoarding that

00:41:47.026 --> 00:41:51.519
natural gift just as that
unprofitable servant had buried

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:55.050
his talent in the earth.Now
the Lady,

00:41:55.050 --> 00:41:59.573
it's been noted before,
is never really able to respond

00:41:59.573 --> 00:42:02.840
to Comus' accusation of her
hoarding.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:05.975
She discusses what she would
like to say in response to

00:42:05.975 --> 00:42:09.460
Comus, but she doesn't then go
on significantly to say it.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.590
She says nothing after this
encounter, remaining silent or

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:18.190
speechless for the rest of the
masque,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:21.253
 but Milton clearly
finds, I think,

00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:26.729
something threatening here.
If Comus can be seen to pose a

00:42:26.729 --> 00:42:32.466
genuine threat to the Lady,
it could very well be the

00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:38.314
threat posed by the power of
Comus' particular kind of

00:42:38.314 --> 00:42:43.719
poetry.I should have put on
the handout,

00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:47.352
and I failed to do that,
the name of a couple of works

00:42:47.352 --> 00:42:51.463
of Milton criticism that are
especially valuable with respect

00:42:51.463 --> 00:42:55.369
to what I'm about to argue and
to which I'm indebted.

00:42:55.369 --> 00:42:58.582
One is the chapter on Comus
in a book by John Guillory

00:42:58.582 --> 00:43:02.973
called Poetic Authority,
 and the other is the

00:43:02.973 --> 00:43:08.220
entire book by Angus Fletcher on
Milton's Comus,

00:43:13.139 --> 00:43:16.059
titled The Transcendental
Mask.

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:21.449
Both Guillory and Angus
Fletcher are examining the

00:43:21.449 --> 00:43:27.940
troubled relation of Milton to
one of his favorite poets.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.302
It's surely not insignificant
that Milton's Comus

00:43:31.302 --> 00:43:35.059
contains more echoes of
Shakespeare than anything else

00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:38.101
that Milton wrote,
and it's surely not

00:43:38.101 --> 00:43:43.210
insignificant that the Lady's
first song is actually addressed

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:46.705
to the nymph Echo.
The masque is all about

00:43:46.705 --> 00:43:49.425
the act of hearing song and the
ethics of proper

00:43:49.425 --> 00:43:53.070
listening.The Lady's first
line in the masque is,

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:57.820
in fact, about the music that
Comus is producing that she

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:03.743
hears: "This way the noise was,
if mine ear be true,

00:44:03.743 --> 00:44:08.821
/ my best guide now."
Comus and the Lady are

00:44:08.821 --> 00:44:12.030
continually listening to each
other's songs,

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.984
and the Lady's goal is in some
way to develop a way of

00:44:15.984 --> 00:44:20.461
listening that isn't at the same
time overwhelming or perhaps

00:44:20.461 --> 00:44:23.947
deafening.
Now what the Lady listens to

00:44:23.947 --> 00:44:26.719
might well be overwhelming
indeed.

00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:31.503
It's the speeches of Comus far
more than those of any other

00:44:31.503 --> 00:44:36.203
character that are filled with
echoes and allusions to the

00:44:36.203 --> 00:44:40.782
great plays of Shakespeare.
Shakespeare presents himself as

00:44:40.782 --> 00:44:44.305
something like a powerful
temptation in this masque.

00:44:44.305 --> 00:44:48.155
We remember that Milton's
anonymous attacker in 1642 had

00:44:48.155 --> 00:44:51.939
not only claimed that Milton
could be found skulking around

00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:54.809
the back alleys of London's
brothels.

00:44:54.809 --> 00:44:58.748
Milton was also a denizen,
it was alleged in this attack

00:44:58.748 --> 00:45:01.969
-- he was a denizen of London's
playhouses.

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:05.166
You can't help but notice that
Milton in the Apology for

00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:08.033
Smectymnuus doesn't even
begin to respond to that

00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:10.082
accusation.
It's like the Lady with the

00:45:10.082 --> 00:45:13.577
accusation of hoarding.
Shakespeare in the theater

00:45:13.577 --> 00:45:19.224
seemed to represent a temptation
greater even than promiscuous

00:45:19.224 --> 00:45:24.111
sex -- or perhaps akin to sex.
It's as if Milton places the

00:45:24.111 --> 00:45:27.905
beautiful poetry of Shakespeare
into the mouth of this evil

00:45:27.905 --> 00:45:31.699
magician so as to dismiss all
the more easily the easy,

00:45:31.699 --> 00:45:36.101
"L'Allegro"-mode of poetry that
Shakespeare seems for Milton to

00:45:36.101 --> 00:45:40.007
embody.Now we've been
charting for a couple of weeks

00:45:40.007 --> 00:45:43.840
now Milton's long-standing
project to purge his lips of

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.172
secular interests and to cleanse
his literary consciousness of

00:45:48.172 --> 00:45:52.289
the tempting influence of
secular literary voices,

00:45:52.289 --> 00:45:56.250
and one of those voices is
obviously Shakespeare's.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:46:00.563
And so it's an understandable
ploy on Milton's part that he

00:46:00.563 --> 00:46:05.099
needs to vilify Shakespeare by
identifying that great poet,

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:10.289
his older contemporary,
with Comus.

00:46:10.289 --> 00:46:13.397
But the standoff between Milton
and Shakespeare,

00:46:13.397 --> 00:46:16.636
much like the standoff between
Comus and the Lady,

00:46:16.636 --> 00:46:20.139
is not as easily resolved as it
might seem to be.

00:46:20.139 --> 00:46:23.842
The logic, the beauty,
of Comus' rhetoric seems often

00:46:23.842 --> 00:46:27.687
to overpower the Lady's own,
which is itself admittedly

00:46:27.687 --> 00:46:31.421
beautiful and powerful.
And we see in the poem itself

00:46:31.421 --> 00:46:35.231
an anticipation of the struggle
that results eventually in the

00:46:35.231 --> 00:46:38.730
eighteenth century in the new
title of the masque.

00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:41.682
Comus has successfully
[laughs]

00:46:41.682 --> 00:46:46.357
-- eventually –
edged the Lady out as the

00:46:46.357 --> 00:46:50.493
center of the entire work.
In the play itself,

00:46:50.493 --> 00:46:54.160
in the fiction of the play,
Comus' argument simply leaves

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.630
the Lady in silence -- and more
than just silence.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:01.314
She's actually incapable of --
she's capable,

00:47:01.314 --> 00:47:06.339
but only partially capable --
of speaking, but she's actually

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:11.217
physically incapable of moving.
Most awkwardly,

00:47:11.217 --> 00:47:16.670
the Lady is physically stuck to
her seat.

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:23.738
She's stuck to a -- this is
remarkable: she's stuck to a

00:47:23.738 --> 00:47:31.450
"marble venomed seat smeared
with gums of glutinous heat."

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.196
Think about that.
All this, Comus explains (this

00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:38.400
is line 658):
Nay Lady, sit;

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.852
if I but wave this wand,
Your nerves are all chain'd up

00:47:41.852 --> 00:47:45.390
in Alabaster,
And you a statue;

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.677
or as Daphne was,
Root-bound that fled

00:47:48.677 --> 00:47:52.043
Apollo.
Now this isn't the first time

00:47:52.043 --> 00:47:56.470
that we have in Milton the
representation of the turning of

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:59.839
a person to marble.
This is actually a recurrent

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:03.277
figure in the early poems,
a figure of frozenness or of --

00:48:03.277 --> 00:48:06.716
isn't it wonderful that there's
a term for being turned to

00:48:06.716 --> 00:48:09.840
marble?
Marmorialization.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:13.389
This marmorialization appears
in a lot of the early poems.

00:48:13.389 --> 00:48:15.914
I'm thinking of "On
Shakespeare," the poem "The

00:48:15.914 --> 00:48:18.986
Passion," as well as
"L'Allegro" and "Il

00:48:18.986 --> 00:48:21.933
Penseroso."
And there's a moment in a

00:48:21.933 --> 00:48:25.741
lot of these poems in which the
speaker finds himself

00:48:25.741 --> 00:48:29.550
motionless, immobile -- actually
turned to stone.

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:37.737
In "On Shakespeare" it seemed
to be the specter of Shakespeare

00:48:37.737 --> 00:48:45.791
that elicited this set of terms
and images, the idea of being

00:48:45.791 --> 00:48:51.450
frozen or marmorialized.
"ost make us Marble with too

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.980
much conceiving," Milton had
told Shakespeare in that

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:58.849
poem.The Lady in Milton's
masque is placed in a

00:48:58.849 --> 00:49:02.989
similar predicament by the
Shakespearean power of Comus.

00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:08.199
She's rendered motionless and
she's finally unable to speak.

00:49:08.199 --> 00:49:13.107
She's unable to speak except to
hint at a doctrine of virginity

00:49:13.107 --> 00:49:18.093
that finally she is incapable of
articulating but -- and this is

00:49:18.093 --> 00:49:22.526
where we have to end this
session -- the Lady does by the

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:25.929
end of the poem get up from her
seat.

00:49:25.929 --> 00:49:28.604
She's released from her
paralysis and she proceeds

00:49:28.604 --> 00:49:31.279
happily with her brothers,
by the end of the poem,

00:49:31.279 --> 00:49:35.132
to honor their father in Wales.
And if we wish to continue this

00:49:35.132 --> 00:49:38.829
analogy, and I certainly do,
between the poet Milton and the

00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:41.638
virgin Lady,
we can see that this is a

00:49:41.638 --> 00:49:46.046
release that John Milton the
poet has been waiting some time

00:49:46.046 --> 00:49:48.345
for.
And so it only stands to reason

00:49:48.345 --> 00:49:51.725
that we pay some attention --
and we'll have to do this next

00:49:51.725 --> 00:49:54.360
week -- to how this release
actually works.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.832
Just briefly,
a supernatural figure,

00:49:56.832 --> 00:50:00.365
the nymph: it looks like
Sabrina, but it was likely

00:50:00.365 --> 00:50:04.399
pronounced Sabrina.
The nymph Sabrina rises from a

00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:09.377
stream and unglues -- unglues --
the Lady from her seat.Now

00:50:09.377 --> 00:50:13.955
the mysterious mechanics of
Sabrina's magic are profoundly

00:50:13.955 --> 00:50:18.209
mysterious,
and so I'm going to ask you to

00:50:18.209 --> 00:50:23.751
look especially closely for the
next class at the Sabrina

00:50:23.751 --> 00:50:26.891
episode.
I also want you to look closely

00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:29.869
at the lines that are noted on
the syllabus.

00:50:29.869 --> 00:50:33.646
These are lines that were added
a couple of years after the

00:50:33.646 --> 00:50:37.270
performance of Comus.
These are lines added when

00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:41.260
Milton actually gets around to
publishing the masque in 1637.

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.170
So this is my final thought
here.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:48.248
If Milton as a poet who had
never really published anything

00:50:48.248 --> 00:50:52.889
significant thinks of himself as
a virginal writer,

00:50:52.889 --> 00:50:57.740
then there's an important way
in which Milton loses his

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:03.400
virginity with his published
version of Comus in 1637.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.796
So for next week -- no,
for Wednesday,

00:51:06.796 --> 00:51:07.796
reread Comus.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.807
Professor Steven Smith:
Today I have the impossible

00:00:05.807 --> 00:00:10.501
task of finishing the parts of
the Republic that I have

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:15.093
assigned for the class.
And in the past sometimes,

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:20.410
I've assigned a full two weeks
to the Republic,

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.785
which would be four lectures,
but because I wanted to do some

00:00:23.785 --> 00:00:25.980
other things with the course as
well,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.111
I had to cut the
Republic by one lecture,

00:00:29.111 --> 00:00:31.510
and now I'm paying for that
today.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.109
So I'm going to try to rush
through, unfortunately,

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.212
a number of the major themes
regarding the creation of the

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:42.438
just city,
the creation of Kallipolis and

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.544
then try to end the class by
talking about,

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:48.280
as I like to do for every
thinker,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.340
what does in this case,
what does Plato,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.400
what are his views on modern
America.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.690
What does Plato say to us today?
But I want to start with what

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.443
is one of the grand themes of
the Republic,

00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:07.501
it is indicated in Book II by
Adeimantus' speech about

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:11.923
self-control.
It is introduced further by the

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:17.323
claims of Socrates to control,
to censor, to control the

00:01:17.323 --> 00:01:22.727
poetry and the arts of the city.
And this is the big theme of

00:01:22.727 --> 00:01:26.310
what one might call "the control
of the passions."

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.894
This is the theme of every
great moralist from Spinoza to

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:36.390
Kant to Freud.
How do we control the passions?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.150
And it is certainly a large
theme of Plato's theory of

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.346
justice in the Republic.
Every great moral philosopher

00:01:43.346 --> 00:01:48.554
has a strategy for helping us
submit our passions to some kind

00:01:48.554 --> 00:01:53.250
of control, to some kind of
supervening moral power.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.512
And again, recall this is the
theme raised at the beginning of

00:01:57.512 --> 00:02:01.519
Book II by Adeimantus,
who puts forward an idea of

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:04.022
self-control,
or what he calls

00:02:04.022 --> 00:02:09.683
self-guardianship as his goal.
How can we protect ourselves

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:15.481
from the passion for injustice?
And one of the things Socrates

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:20.300
emphasizes is that the most
powerful of those passions,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.595
the most powerful passion is
that Socratic passion that he

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:31.339
calls thumos,
or what our translator has as

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:36.313
spiritedness,
anger, maybe what biblical

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:41.071
translators call heart,
having a big heart,

00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:44.560
having thumos and all of
that implies.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.936
This is for Plato,
the political passion par

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:53.568
excellence.
It is a kind of fiery love of

00:02:53.568 --> 00:03:00.640
fame, love of distinction that
leads men and women of a certain

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.230
type to pursue their ambitions
in public life,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.166
in the public space.
It is clearly connected this

00:03:11.166 --> 00:03:16.213
notion of spiritedness or this
thumotic quality to our

00:03:16.213 --> 00:03:20.879
capacities for heroism and for
self-sacrifice.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.651
But it is also connected to our
desires for domination and the

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:30.530
desire to exercise tyranny over
others.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.639
Thumos has a kind of
dual component to it.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.888
It can lead us to a sense of
kind of righteous indignation

00:03:37.888 --> 00:03:40.720
and anger at the sight of
injustice,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.629
but it can also lead us in a
rather contradictory way to

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.970
desire to dominate and tyrannize
over others.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.118
This is the quality that
Socrates regards as being

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:57.030
possessed by every great
political leader and statesman,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.233
but it is also clearly a
quality possessed by every

00:04:01.233 --> 00:04:04.349
tyrant.
And the question posed by the

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.708
Republic,
in many ways,

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:11.590
the question around which the
book as a whole gravitates,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.219
is whether this thumotic
quality can be controlled.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:19.076
Can it be re-directed,
can it be re-channeled in the

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:23.723
service of the public good?
Socrates introduces the problem

00:04:23.723 --> 00:04:28.393
of thumos by a story,
a particularly vivid story that

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:33.638
I hope you all remember,
where in Book IV he tells the

00:04:33.638 --> 00:04:37.389
story about Leontius at the
walls.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.917
"Leontius," he writes,
"was proceeding from the

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:45.595
Piraeus outside the north wall
when he perceived corpses lying

00:04:45.595 --> 00:04:49.501
near the public executioner.
At the same time,

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:53.302
he desired to see them.
He wanted to see this grotesque

00:04:53.302 --> 00:04:55.449
sight, these dead bodies lying
there.

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.067
And to the contrary,
he felt disgust and turned

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:04.022
himself away and for a while he
battled with himself and hid his

00:05:04.022 --> 00:05:06.774
face.
But eventually overpowered by

00:05:06.774 --> 00:05:11.144
desire, he forced his eyes open
and rushing towards the corpses

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:16.596
said 'see you damn wretches,
take your fill of this

00:05:16.596 --> 00:05:23.482
beautiful sight'" 439c.
That story that Socrates tells

00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:29.020
here is not one of reason
controlling the passions,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.222
but rather one of intense
internal conflict that Leontius

00:05:35.222 --> 00:05:39.108
felt.
We see his conflicting emotions

00:05:39.108 --> 00:05:43.770
both to see and not to see,
a sense that he wished to

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.316
observe and yet he is at,
in some ways,

00:05:47.316 --> 00:05:50.186
at war with himself,
knowing to gawk,

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:53.882
to stare at this sight.
There's something shameful

00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:57.925
about it and he felt shame.
One example I particularly like

00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:02.515
of this was suggested last year,
I think, by Justin Zaremby who

00:06:02.515 --> 00:06:06.957
said it's the emotion we all
feel when we're driving down the

00:06:06.957 --> 00:06:10.452
highway,
right, and we see a car crash

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:14.470
or we go by a wreck and
everybody slows down,

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.870
right, they all want to see.
What are they hoping to see?

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.820
Well, they want to see blood,
they want to see if there's a

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.720
body, they want to see how much
damage has been caused.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.642
And we've all been in this,
where we know that it's

00:06:26.642 --> 00:06:29.288
shameful to look at this,
just drive on,

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:33.641
as Socrates would say "mind
your own business," and yet at

00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:37.987
the same time we feel,
even against our will,

00:06:37.987 --> 00:06:42.420
compelled to look and think
about that.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.952
And think about that and this
case of Leontius the next time

00:06:46.952 --> 00:06:50.870
you, for those of you who have
driver's licenses,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:56.519
are next driving on the highway
and see something like that.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:07:00.993
It is the thumos that is
the cause of--that should be the

00:07:00.993 --> 00:07:04.259
cause of your shame at slowing
down to look.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.223
Sometimes we can't help but
slow down because everybody is

00:07:07.223 --> 00:07:09.720
slowed down in front of us,
we have no choice.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.244
But anyway, that incident,
that story that Socrates

00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:19.944
relates is connected to the fact
that Leontius is a certain kind

00:07:19.944 --> 00:07:23.438
of man.
He regards himself as proud,

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:26.828
independent,
someone who wants to be in

00:07:26.828 --> 00:07:30.129
control of his emotions but
isn't.

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:34.173
He is a soul at war with
himself, and potentially

00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:38.671
therefore, at war with others.
And what the Republic

00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:42.338
tries to do is to offer us
strategies, maybe we might even

00:07:42.338 --> 00:07:45.834
call it a therapy,
for dealing with thumos,

00:07:45.834 --> 00:07:49.709
for submitting it to the
control of reason and helping us

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:52.200
to achieve some level of
balance,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.931
of self-control and moderation.
And these are the qualities

00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.201
taken together that Socrates
calls justice,

00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:04.638
that can only be achieved when
reason is in control of the

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:09.929
appetites and desires.
Again, a question the book asks

00:08:09.929 --> 00:08:15.895
is whether that ideal of justice
can be used as a model for

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:20.330
politics.
Can it serve as a model for

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.324
justice in the city?
This connection he has

00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:28.222
established between justice in
the city and justice in the

00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:30.687
soul,
what are the therapies or

00:08:30.687 --> 00:08:35.596
strategies for solving injustice
in the soul or imbalance of some

00:08:35.596 --> 00:08:38.765
kind in the soul?
Can those be transferred or

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:42.521
translated in some way to public
justice, to political justice,

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.400
justice in the polis?

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.350
Right?
You with me on that so far?

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.645
So, on the basis of this,
Socrates proposes how to

00:08:58.645 --> 00:09:03.729
proceed with the construction of
Kallipolis, and he does so

00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:07.059
through what he calls three
waves.

00:09:07.059 --> 00:09:10.527
There are three waves,
three waves of reform,

00:09:10.527 --> 00:09:13.600
so to speak,
that will contribute to the

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.541
creation of the city.
The first of these waves is,

00:09:17.541 --> 00:09:20.358
you remember,
the restrictions on private

00:09:20.358 --> 00:09:24.019
property, even the abolition of
private property.

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:28.718
The second, the abolition of
the family, and the third wave

00:09:28.718 --> 00:09:32.850
being the establishment of the
philosopher kings.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.701
Each of these waves is regarded
as in some way necessary for the

00:09:37.701 --> 00:09:40.549
proper construction of a just
city.

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:42.995
And I'm not going to speak
about all of them,

00:09:42.995 --> 00:09:45.440
but I do want to speak a little
bit about,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.239
because it has particular
relevance for us,

00:09:49.239 --> 00:09:53.762
his proposals for the
co-education of men and women

00:09:53.762 --> 00:09:57.110
that is a great part of his
plan,

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.684
especially related to the
abolition of the family,

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:06.260
that men and women be educated
in the same way,

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:06.960
right.

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:18.459
The core of Socrates' proposal
for equal education is presented

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:26.509
in a context that he knows to be
or suggests will be laughable.

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:30.044
It will certainly be seen that
way, he suggests,

00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:33.457
by Glaucon and Adeimantus.
There is no job,

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:37.951
he states, that cannot be
performed equally well by both

00:10:37.951 --> 00:10:42.799
men and women.
Is Socrates a feminist?

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.527
Gender differences,
he says, are no more relevant

00:10:46.527 --> 00:10:50.799
when it comes to positions of
political rule than is the

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:54.759
distinction between being bald
and being hairy.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:58.606
Socrates is not saying that men
and women are the same in every

00:10:58.606 --> 00:11:01.212
respect, he says,
but equal with respect to

00:11:01.212 --> 00:11:07.094
competing for any job at all.
There will be no glass ceilings

00:11:07.094 --> 00:11:11.105
in Kallipolis.
The first, in many ways,

00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:15.237
great defender,
the first great champion of the

00:11:15.237 --> 00:11:19.190
emancipation of women from the
household.

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:21.730
But this proposal comes at
certain costs,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.632
he tells us.
The proposal for a level

00:11:24.632 --> 00:11:28.909
playing field demands,
of course, equal education.

00:11:28.909 --> 00:11:34.577
And here he says that men and
women, being submitted to the

00:11:34.577 --> 00:11:38.675
same regime, will mean,
among other things,

00:11:38.675 --> 00:11:43.554
that they will compete with one
another in co-educational

00:11:43.554 --> 00:11:46.676
gymnasia.
They will compete with each

00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:51.289
other in the nude because that
is the way Greeks exercised.

00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:57.441
They will compete naked in
co-educational gymnasia,

00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:59.410
think of that.

00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:09.408
Furthermore,
their marriages and their

00:12:09.408 --> 00:12:11.655
procreations will be,
he tells us,

00:12:11.655 --> 00:12:15.651
for the sake of the city.
There is nothing like romantic

00:12:15.651 --> 00:12:18.750
love among the members of the
guardian class.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.885
Sexual relations will be
intended purely for the sake of

00:12:23.885 --> 00:12:28.740
reproduction and unwanted
fetuses will be aborted.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.827
The only exception to this
prohibition is for members of

00:12:36.827 --> 00:12:40.600
the guardian class who are
beyond the age of reproduction,

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.143
he tells us,
and they, he says,

00:12:43.143 --> 00:12:48.230
can have sex if they're still
able, with anyone they like.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.948
A kind of version of
recreational sex as a reward for

00:12:52.948 --> 00:12:57.854
a lifetime of self-control.
Child-bearing may be inevitable

00:12:57.854 --> 00:13:02.550
for women but the rearing of the
child will be the responsibility

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.879
of the community or at least a
class of guardians and common

00:13:06.879 --> 00:13:11.041
daycare centers.
A sort of variation of Hillary

00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:16.546
Clinton's book that "it takes a
village to raise a child," comes

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:21.460
right out of Plato apparently.
No child should know their

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:25.990
biological parents and no parent
should know their child.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.575
The purpose of this scheme
being to eliminate senses of

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:35.754
mine and me, to promote a kind
of common sense of esprit de

00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:40.340
corps among the members of
the guardian class,

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:46.239
"a community of pleasure and
pain," Socrates calls it at

00:13:46.239 --> 00:13:49.213
464a.
What we are creating is a

00:13:49.213 --> 00:13:54.489
community of pleasure and pain.
I will feel your pains,

00:13:54.489 --> 00:13:58.080
and of course you will feel
mine.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.554
The objections to Socrates,
are of course,

00:14:01.554 --> 00:14:05.707
you know, raised as early as by
Aristotle himself,

00:14:05.707 --> 00:14:10.857
in the very next generation.
How can we care for things,

00:14:10.857 --> 00:14:15.370
how can we truly care for
things that are common?

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.944
We learn to care for things
that are closest to us,

00:14:18.944 --> 00:14:23.322
that are in some way our own.
We can only show proper love

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:27.647
and concern for things that are
ours, not things that are

00:14:27.647 --> 00:14:30.328
common.
Common ownership,

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:35.155
Aristotle argues,
will mean a sort of common

00:14:35.155 --> 00:14:39.371
neglect.
Children will not be raised

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:46.219
better by putting them under the
common care of guardians or in

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:51.409
daycares but they will be
equally neglected.

00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:53.559
But it is in this,
and you can think about that,

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:55.159
about whether that's true or
not,

00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:59.311
but it is in the same context
of his treatment of men and

00:14:59.311 --> 00:15:03.537
women that something else often
goes unnoticed and that is

00:15:03.537 --> 00:15:07.169
Socrates' efforts to rewrite the
laws of war,

00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:11.712
because of course the guardians
are being trained and educated

00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:14.149
to be guards,
to be warriors,

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:17.230
to be members of a military
class.

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:19.994
In the first place,
he tells us,

00:15:19.994 --> 00:15:23.649
children must be taught the art
of war.

00:15:23.649 --> 00:15:27.105
This must be the beginning of
their education,

00:15:27.105 --> 00:15:30.485
Socrates says,
making the children spectators

00:15:30.485 --> 00:15:33.121
of war.
Children will be taken,

00:15:33.121 --> 00:15:36.703
he seems to suggest,
to battles and to sites of

00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:42.090
where fighting is going on,
to be spectators for them to

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:48.846
become used to and habituated to
seeing war and what everything

00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:52.926
that goes on.
Not only is expulsion from the

00:15:52.926 --> 00:15:56.509
ranks of the guardians penalty
for cowardice,

00:15:56.509 --> 00:16:01.377
but Socrates suggests there
should be, listen to this,

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:05.970
"erotic rewards for those who
excel in bravery."

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.059
Erotic rewards for excellence
in bravery.

00:16:09.059 --> 00:16:13.578
Consider the following
remarkable proposal at 468c,

00:16:13.578 --> 00:16:18.000
"and I add to the laws of war,"
Socrates writes,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.240
"that as long as they,
the guardians,

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.200
are on campaign,
no one whom he wants to kiss

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:30.583
should be permitted to refuse.
So that if a man happens to

00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:33.479
love someone,
either male of female,

00:16:33.479 --> 00:16:38.029
he would be more eager to win
the rewards of valor."

00:16:38.029 --> 00:16:43.801
That is to say as a reward for
bravery, exhibited bravery,

00:16:43.801 --> 00:16:49.977
the hero should be allowed to
kiss anyone they like while they

00:16:49.977 --> 00:16:55.120
are on patrol,
male or female.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.830
A particularly puritanical
editor of Plato from the

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.059
twentieth century writes in a
footnote to that passage,

00:17:03.059 --> 00:17:08.163
"this is almost the only
passage in Plato that one would

00:17:08.163 --> 00:17:12.308
wish to blot out,"
his sensibilities were offended

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:15.024
by this notion.
But I wonder what kind of,

00:17:15.024 --> 00:17:18.330
if this might even make a
powerful incentive for military

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:19.570
recruitment today.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.880
What do you think?

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.400
Well, think about it.
I don't know.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.750
So, at long last,
we move from the education of

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:43.067
the guards to justice.
What is justice,

00:17:43.067 --> 00:17:46.930
we've been questioning asking
ourselves throughout this book

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.335
in which Plato has been,
Socrates has been teasing us

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.438
with.
At long last we come to this

00:17:52.438 --> 00:17:55.204
thing.
The platonic idea of justice

00:17:55.204 --> 00:17:57.694
concerns harmony,
he tells us,

00:17:57.694 --> 00:18:02.160
both harmony in the city and
harmony in the soul.

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.039
We learn that the two are
actually homologous in some way.

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:10.545
Justice is defined as what
binds the city together and

00:18:10.545 --> 00:18:13.559
makes it one.
Or he puts it another way,

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:16.972
consists of everyone and
everything performing those

00:18:16.972 --> 00:18:20.049
functions for which they are
best equipped.

00:18:20.049 --> 00:18:22.738
Each of the other citizens,
Socrates says,

00:18:22.738 --> 00:18:25.952
must be brought to that which
naturally suits him,

00:18:25.952 --> 00:18:28.771
which naturally suits him,
one man, one job,

00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:32.036
he says.
So that each man practicing his

00:18:32.036 --> 00:18:35.670
own which is one,
will not become many but one.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.692
Thus you see,
he says, the whole city will

00:18:38.692 --> 00:18:43.004
naturally grow up together.
Justice seems to mean adhering

00:18:43.004 --> 00:18:45.686
to the principal,
justice in the city,

00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:49.309
adhering to the principal of
division of labor.

00:18:49.309 --> 00:18:53.930
One man, one job,
everyone doing or performing

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:58.549
the task that naturally fits or
suits them.

00:18:58.549 --> 00:19:01.352
One can, of course,
as you've already imagined,

00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:04.764
raise several objections to
this view and again Aristotle

00:19:04.764 --> 00:19:08.577
seems to take the lead.
Plato's excessive emphasis on

00:19:08.577 --> 00:19:12.837
unity would seem to destroy the
natural diversity of human

00:19:12.837 --> 00:19:18.080
beings that make up a city.
Is there one and only one thing

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:24.283
that each person does best?
And if so, who could decide

00:19:24.283 --> 00:19:27.277
this?
Would such a plan of justice

00:19:27.277 --> 00:19:31.632
not be overly coercive in
forcing people into predefined

00:19:31.632 --> 00:19:35.305
social roles?
Shouldn't individuals be free

00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:40.199
to choose for themselves their
own plans of life wherever it

00:19:40.199 --> 00:19:43.482
may take them?
But however that may be,

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:47.618
Plato believes he has found in
the formula of one man,

00:19:47.618 --> 00:19:51.910
one job, a certain foundation
for political justice.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.287
That is to say,
the three parts of the cities,

00:19:55.287 --> 00:19:57.839
workers, auxiliaries,
guardians,

00:19:57.839 --> 00:20:02.196
each of them all work together
and each by minding their own

00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:05.150
business, that is doing their
own job,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:10.559
out of this a certain kind of
peace and harmony will prevail.

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.818
And since the city,
you remember,

00:20:12.818 --> 00:20:16.842
is simply the soul at large,
the three classes of the city

00:20:16.842 --> 00:20:20.160
merely express the three parts
of the soul.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.474
The soul is just,
he tells us,

00:20:22.474 --> 00:20:25.027
when the appetites,
spiritedness,

00:20:25.027 --> 00:20:27.980
and reason cooperate with
reason,

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:31.944
ruling, spirit and appetite,
just as in the polis,

00:20:31.944 --> 00:20:36.049
the philosopher-king rules the
warriors and the workers.

00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:40.491
The result, he tells us,
is a kind of balance of the

00:20:40.491 --> 00:20:42.930
parts of the whole,
right.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:47.059
Justice is a kind of harmony in
which the three parts of the

00:20:47.059 --> 00:20:51.329
city and the three parts of the
soul are direct expressions of

00:20:51.329 --> 00:20:52.450
one another.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:04.801
But that formula forces us to
return to the original Socratic

00:21:04.801 --> 00:21:11.480
question about the harmony of
the soul and the city.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.443
Is the structure of a city
identical to the structure of a

00:21:15.443 --> 00:21:17.740
soul?
Are they really identical?

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:21.990
Well, maybe, maybe not.
For example,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:26.583
every individual consists of
three parts, of appetite,

00:21:26.583 --> 00:21:31.389
spirit, and reason.
Yet each of us will be confined

00:21:31.389 --> 00:21:36.160
it seems to only one task in the
social hierarchy.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:41.299
I assume what Socrates means by
that is though each individual

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:45.092
will, each of us,
embody all three features of

00:21:45.092 --> 00:21:47.755
soul, appetite,
spirit, and reason,

00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:52.609
only one of these will be the
dominate trait in each of us.

00:21:52.609 --> 00:21:57.828
Some of us will be dominantly
appetitive personalities,

00:21:57.828 --> 00:22:02.369
others will be dominantly
spirited and so on.

00:22:02.369 --> 00:22:06.562
But even still when we think of
it, if I am a member of the

00:22:06.562 --> 00:22:10.460
money making class,
I am still more than simply a

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:15.631
bundle of desires and appetites,
just as a member of the warrior

00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:20.392
class would be clearly more than
mere thumos or mere

00:22:20.392 --> 00:22:24.575
spiritedness.
So, to confine the individual,

00:22:24.575 --> 00:22:29.984
it seems, to one and only one
sphere of life would seem to do

00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:35.124
an injustice to the internal
psychological complexity that

00:22:35.124 --> 00:22:40.330
makes each of us who we are.
Let's examine that problem from

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.920
a slightly different point of
view.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.673
Socrates tells us repeatedly
that justice in the city

00:22:46.673 --> 00:22:50.851
consists of each member,
each citizen fulfilling his

00:22:50.851 --> 00:22:56.220
task in the social division of
labor, in the social hierarchy.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.819
But this seems to be a very far
cry, does it not,

00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:03.944
from the kind of justice he
talks about in the soul that

00:23:03.944 --> 00:23:08.595
consists in what we might think
of as sort of rational autonomy

00:23:08.595 --> 00:23:12.869
or self-control where reason
controls the passions and the

00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:16.993
appetites.
In fact, the vast majority of

00:23:16.993 --> 00:23:21.871
citizens in even the
platonically just city will not

00:23:21.871 --> 00:23:26.079
necessarily have platonically
just souls.

00:23:26.079 --> 00:23:30.159
The harmony and self-discipline
of the city will not be due,

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:34.030
it seems, to each and every
member of the city but rather

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.223
will rely on the guardian class,
that special class of

00:23:38.223 --> 00:23:42.360
philosopher kings who will rule,
let it be recalled,

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:47.101
through selective lies,
myths, and other various kinds

00:23:47.101 --> 00:23:51.115
of deception.
So how can it be the case if at

00:23:51.115 --> 00:23:56.326
all, that you could have a just
city, that is to say a city

00:23:56.326 --> 00:24:00.549
where everyone is performing
their own task,

00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:04.964
they're following the division
of labor, and yet very few of

00:24:04.964 --> 00:24:07.793
those members will have,
so to speak,

00:24:07.793 --> 00:24:10.663
platonically just souls,
that is to say,

00:24:10.663 --> 00:24:13.827
souls dominated by a kind of
self-control or

00:24:13.827 --> 00:24:18.308
self-guardianship?
That would certainly not be

00:24:18.308 --> 00:24:23.988
true of the members of the
artisan class or the military

00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:27.766
class for that reason.
So the question,

00:24:27.766 --> 00:24:31.429
that question is posed,
that objection is posed by

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:35.690
Adeimantus, you remember,
at the beginning of Book IV.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.861
"What would your apology be
Socrates," Adeimantus says,

00:24:38.861 --> 00:24:42.092
"if it were objected that
you're hardly making these men

00:24:42.092 --> 00:24:46.221
happy,
these people just," he says at

00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:48.597
419a.
Adeimantus is concerned that

00:24:48.597 --> 00:24:52.349
Socrates is being unfair to the
auxiliaries and the guardians,

00:24:52.349 --> 00:24:55.799
giving them all the
responsibilities but none of the

00:24:55.799 --> 00:24:59.992
rewards, none of the pleasures
that would seem to be the reward

00:24:59.992 --> 00:25:04.460
of responsibility.
How can a citizen of Kallipolis

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:10.230
live a just or happy life if he
or she is deprived of most of

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:13.980
the goods or pleasures that we
seek?

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:18.589
Socrates gives a rather lame
response.

00:25:18.589 --> 00:25:22.263
In founding the city,
he says, we are not looking to

00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:26.801
the exceptional happiness of any
one individual or any group but

00:25:26.801 --> 00:25:31.437
rather to the city as a whole.
And Adeimantus appears to

00:25:31.437 --> 00:25:35.286
accept that response,
oh yes, I forgot we are

00:25:35.286 --> 00:25:40.359
concerned with the happiness,
the justice of the whole.

00:25:40.359 --> 00:25:45.661
But his question is still one
that lingers and one that Plato

00:25:45.661 --> 00:25:51.258
includes for a purpose.
What about, how can you have a

00:25:51.258 --> 00:25:56.114
platonically just city if most
people in it,

00:25:56.114 --> 00:26:02.778
certainly most people of the
auxiliary class are deprived of

00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:08.200
the pleasures and the goods that
we desire?

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.994
It's a question that lingers
and one might wonder whether

00:26:12.994 --> 00:26:17.359
Socrates ever successfully
answers that question.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:23.236
He silences Adeimantus in some
way as he silences Thrasymachus

00:26:23.236 --> 00:26:26.452
earlier;
that is not always to say that

00:26:26.452 --> 00:26:29.230
their objections have been
answered.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:33.706
And that leads,
as it were, to the third and

00:26:33.706 --> 00:26:39.744
final wave of paradox of the
Kallipolis which is the famous

00:26:39.744 --> 00:26:43.700
proposal for the
philosopher-king.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.039
What is Plato without the
philosopher-king?

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:48.369
What is the Republic
without the philosopher-king?

00:26:48.369 --> 00:26:52.686
Unless the philosophers rule as
kings or those now called kings,

00:26:52.686 --> 00:26:57.301
genuinely philosophize,
there will be no rest from the

00:26:57.301 --> 00:27:00.880
ills for the cities,
he says, right?

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:03.188
Socrates presents this
proposal, again,

00:27:03.188 --> 00:27:06.506
as outlandish.
He says he expects to be

00:27:06.506 --> 00:27:11.121
drowned in laughter.
And this has led some readers

00:27:11.121 --> 00:27:16.950
to suggest that the proposal for
philosophers' kings is ironical.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:22.176
That it is intended as a kind
of joke to, in many ways,

00:27:22.176 --> 00:27:28.176
discredit the idea of the just
city or at least to indicate its

00:27:28.176 --> 00:27:33.130
extreme implausibility.
The question is why does

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:38.102
Socrates regard philosophic
kingship as required for

00:27:38.102 --> 00:27:43.829
Kallipolis, for the just city?
Let me say, I am by no means

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:48.580
convinced that the idea for the
philosopher-king is an

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:53.509
impossibility or is intended as
a kind of absurdity.

00:27:53.509 --> 00:27:57.167
Plato himself,
remember, made a number of

00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:02.470
trips to Sicily to serve as the
advisor to a king there,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:07.397
Dionysius, and all of these
missions failed and left him

00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:11.754
deeply dispirited.
The ambition in some ways to

00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:17.065
unite philosophy and politics
has been a recurring dream of

00:28:17.065 --> 00:28:20.819
political philosophy ever since
Plato.

00:28:20.819 --> 00:28:24.413
Socrates says he will be
drowned in laughter but many

00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:28.352
other people have taken this
dream or this aspiration very

00:28:28.352 --> 00:28:30.583
seriously.
Consider one thinker,

00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:33.951
and I will, I'm going to read
you a short passage and I'm

00:28:33.951 --> 00:28:37.440
going to come back to this again
later in the semester,

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.292
from Thomas Hobbes'
Leviathan,

00:28:40.292 --> 00:28:44.968
chapter 31 of Leviathan,
where Hobbes gives us a very

00:28:44.968 --> 00:28:50.039
personal statement about his
intention in writing this book.

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:53.667
Hobbes wrote,
"I am at the point of believing

00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:58.202
that my labors will be as
useless as the commonwealth of

00:28:58.202 --> 00:29:00.443
Plato."
He seems to be rather

00:29:00.443 --> 00:29:04.190
despairing about whether this
book is actually going to have

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.634
any affect.
"I'm in the point of believing

00:29:06.634 --> 00:29:09.380
it will be as useless as the
commonwealth of Plato,"

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.696
for he also is of the opinion
that it is impossible for the

00:29:13.696 --> 00:29:18.384
disorders of state and change of
government by civil war ever to

00:29:18.384 --> 00:29:22.180
be taken away until sovereigns
be philosophers.

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.793
But after admitting his despair
about the possibility of

00:29:26.793 --> 00:29:29.730
realizing his ideas and
practice,

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.533
Hobbes continues as follows,
"I recover some hope," he says,

00:29:34.533 --> 00:29:39.074
"that one time or other,
this writing of mine may still

00:29:39.074 --> 00:29:43.194
fall into the hands of a
sovereign who will consider

00:29:43.194 --> 00:29:47.396
himself without the help of any
interested or envious

00:29:47.396 --> 00:29:51.048
interpreter.
And by the exercise of entire

00:29:51.048 --> 00:29:55.055
sovereignty in protecting the
public teaching of it,

00:29:55.055 --> 00:29:59.141
convert this truth of
speculation into the utility of

00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:02.071
practice."
So there you have Hobbes

00:30:02.071 --> 00:30:06.305
talking about his own book,
expecting or at least hoping it

00:30:06.305 --> 00:30:10.319
will fall into the hands of a
sovereign who one day,

00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:14.852
again, without envious or
self-interested interpreters

00:30:14.852 --> 00:30:19.727
may, may one day become a
practical source of guidance for

00:30:19.727 --> 00:30:22.636
statecraft.
Here it is Hobbes taking

00:30:22.636 --> 00:30:26.363
Plato's suggestion very
seriously, and we see this again

00:30:26.363 --> 00:30:30.362
very much in the history of
political philosophy in thinkers

00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:33.582
like Rousseau,
or Marx, or Nietzsche,

00:30:33.582 --> 00:30:38.063
or Machiavelli all of whom
sought to gain the ear of

00:30:38.063 --> 00:30:43.159
political leaders and convert
their ideas into some kind of

00:30:43.159 --> 00:30:47.149
practice.
But most of the objections to

00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:52.953
Plato's particular form of the
philosophic kingship really are

00:30:52.953 --> 00:30:57.140
centered on the practicality of
his idea.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.067
And beyond this,
there is the problem with the

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:04.346
very cogency of the idea itself.
Consider the following,

00:31:04.346 --> 00:31:08.660
can philosophy and politics
actually be united?

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.790
It would seem that the needs of
philosophy are quite different

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.380
from the demands or requirements
of political rule.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:21.120
Can you imagine Socrates
willingly giving up one of his

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:26.037
conversations for the tedious
business of legislation and

00:31:26.037 --> 00:31:29.990
public administration?
Can one imagine that?

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.234
The philosopher is described by
Plato as someone with knowledge

00:31:34.234 --> 00:31:37.794
of the eternal forms,
lying behind or beyond the many

00:31:37.794 --> 00:31:41.750
particulars.
But just how does that kind of

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:46.993
knowledge help us deal with the
constant ebb and flow of

00:31:46.993 --> 00:31:50.445
political life?
It seems not enough that the

00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:54.228
philosopher have knowledge of
the forms but this knowledge has

00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.460
to be supplemented by
experience,

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.549
by judgment and by a kind of
practical rationality.

00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:05.250
Was Plato simply unaware of
this, I can't believe that.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.470
I don't believe that.
So the question is,

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:13.206
what kind of unity was he
expecting of philosophy and

00:32:13.206 --> 00:32:16.484
politics?
Anyway, philosophers are not

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:20.698
purely thinking machines but
they are also human beings

00:32:20.698 --> 00:32:23.195
composed of reason,
spiritedness,

00:32:23.195 --> 00:32:27.286
and appetite.
Will not even philosophers,

00:32:27.286 --> 00:32:31.067
one might ask,
given the possibility of

00:32:31.067 --> 00:32:36.440
absolute power be tempted to
abuse their positions?

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:43.492
Maybe, maybe not, who knows.
So these are the questions,

00:32:43.492 --> 00:32:47.279
these are at least among the
questions that Socrates or

00:32:47.279 --> 00:32:50.258
Plato,
the author of the book,

00:32:50.258 --> 00:32:54.240
deliberately poses for us to
consider.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:58.871
So what is the doctrine of the
philosopher-king intended to

00:32:58.871 --> 00:33:01.340
prove?
Must the massive effort to

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.635
construct the city in speech in
order to understand justice in

00:33:05.635 --> 00:33:08.864
the soul?
Is it a philosophical

00:33:08.864 --> 00:33:12.589
possibility?
Does he hold it out as a real

00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:17.011
possibility or must it be
considered a failure in some way

00:33:17.011 --> 00:33:21.666
or that if the dialogue does end
in failure what can we learn

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:25.557
from that?
Those are questions I want you

00:33:25.557 --> 00:33:27.920
to consider.
But for now,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:33.819
what I want to do is talk about
Plato's democracy and ours.

00:33:33.819 --> 00:33:38.650
What does Plato teach us about
our own regime?

00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:43.589
Could Plato have imagined such
a regime?

00:33:43.589 --> 00:33:47.230
I think in many ways he can and
he did.

00:33:51.369 --> 00:33:54.029
In one sense,
the Republic,

00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:57.655
and I've given some indications
of this today,

00:33:57.655 --> 00:34:01.281
seems to be the most
anti-democratic book ever

00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:04.408
written.
Its defense of philosophic

00:34:04.408 --> 00:34:08.250
kingship is itself a direct
repudiation of Athenian

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.436
democracy.
Its conception of justice,

00:34:11.436 --> 00:34:15.471
minding one's own business,
is a rejection of the

00:34:15.471 --> 00:34:20.432
democratic belief that citizens
have sufficient knowledge to

00:34:20.432 --> 00:34:24.300
participate in the offices of
government.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:31.139
To be sure, Athenian democracy
is not American democracy.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:35.796
Plato thought of democracy as a
kind of rule by the many that he

00:34:35.796 --> 00:34:40.305
associated with the unrestricted
freedom to do everything that

00:34:40.305 --> 00:34:43.474
one likes.
This seems in many ways to be

00:34:43.474 --> 00:34:46.785
quite far from the American
democracy based on

00:34:46.785 --> 00:34:50.945
constitutional government,
systems of checks and balances,

00:34:50.945 --> 00:34:53.820
protection of individual
rights, and so on.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:57.910
The differences between Athens
and Washington seem to be very

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.958
far.
And yet, in many ways,

00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:06.475
Socrates diagnoses very
powerfully an important

00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:13.191
condition of modern democratic
life with which we are all

00:35:13.191 --> 00:35:17.472
familiar.
Consider this passage in Book

00:35:17.472 --> 00:35:23.037
VIII of the Republic that
I encourage you to read but is

00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:28.298
not on your assigned list.
Socrates writes in Book VIII,

00:35:28.298 --> 00:35:31.782
561c, "speaking of the
democratic soul,

00:35:31.782 --> 00:35:36.309
the democratic man,
he also lives along day by day

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:39.655
gratifying the desire that
occurs to him,

00:35:39.655 --> 00:35:44.703
at one time,
drinking and listening to the

00:35:44.703 --> 00:35:47.773
flute."
Today we have different kinds

00:35:47.773 --> 00:35:51.960
of music to substitute for the
flute but you get the point.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.396
Drinking and listening to the
flute, at another time downing

00:35:57.396 --> 00:36:01.271
water and dieting,
now practicing gymnastics and

00:36:01.271 --> 00:36:04.915
again idling and neglecting
everything, and sometimes

00:36:04.915 --> 00:36:08.278
spending his time as though he
were occupied with

00:36:08.278 --> 00:36:12.065
philosophizing.
Often, he engages in politics

00:36:12.065 --> 00:36:15.767
and jumping up,
says and does whatever chances

00:36:15.767 --> 00:36:19.313
to come to his mind.
And if he ever admires any

00:36:19.313 --> 00:36:21.730
soldiers, he turns in that
direction.

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:26.775
And if money-makers in that one
and there is neither order nor

00:36:26.775 --> 00:36:31.159
necessity in this life but
calling this life sweet,

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:35.800
free, and blessed,
he follows it throughout.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:40.900
Is that image of life at all
familiar to us?

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.902
Doing anything you like,
it seems to be the opposite of

00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:51.091
the platonic understanding of
justice as each one doing a

00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:56.650
special function or fulfilling
or doing a special craft.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:37:01.165
Just doing whatever you like
and calling that sweet,

00:37:01.165 --> 00:37:05.464
free, and blessed throughout.
This account should be

00:37:05.464 --> 00:37:09.491
instantly recognizable as the
state of modern democracy in

00:37:09.491 --> 00:37:11.480
some ways.
There exists,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:16.504
as Plato and Socrates clearly
understand, a very real tendency

00:37:16.504 --> 00:37:20.869
within democracy to identify the
good human being,

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:23.376
the good man with,
you might say,

00:37:23.376 --> 00:37:25.804
the good sport,
the regular guy,

00:37:25.804 --> 00:37:29.501
the cooperative fellow,
you know, someone who goes

00:37:29.501 --> 00:37:31.570
along and gets along with
others.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:35.707
By educating citizens to
cooperate with each other in a

00:37:35.707 --> 00:37:38.389
friendly manner,
democracy seems,

00:37:38.389 --> 00:37:42.202
so Plato is suggesting,
they stand in danger of

00:37:42.202 --> 00:37:46.429
devaluing people who are
prepared to stand alone,

00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:53.805
of rugged individualists who
will go down with the ship if

00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:57.465
need be.
It is precisely this kind of

00:37:57.465 --> 00:38:01.097
creeping conformism,
this kind of easy going

00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:04.864
toleration,
this sort of soft nihilism that

00:38:04.864 --> 00:38:09.199
democracies tend to foster in
which not only Plato,

00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:12.775
but modern thinkers like
Emmerson, and Tocqueville,

00:38:12.775 --> 00:38:17.619
and Mill, John Stewart Mill,
very much warned about.

00:38:17.619 --> 00:38:22.085
What bothers Socrates most
about our democracy is a certain

00:38:22.085 --> 00:38:26.383
kind of instability,
its tendency to be pulled

00:38:26.383 --> 00:38:31.694
between extremes of anarchy,
between lawlessness and

00:38:31.694 --> 00:38:34.958
tyranny.
It is in this section of the

00:38:34.958 --> 00:38:37.380
Republic,
Adeimantus asks,

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:41.769
won't we with Aeschylus say
whatever comes to our lips?

00:38:41.769 --> 00:38:45.139
Won't we say with Aeschylus
whatever comes to our lips?

00:38:45.139 --> 00:38:50.272
The idea of having the liberty
to say whatever comes to our

00:38:50.272 --> 00:38:54.519
lips sounds to Plato like a kind
of blasphemy.

00:38:54.519 --> 00:38:58.771
The view that nothing is
shameful, that everything should

00:38:58.771 --> 00:39:01.883
be permitted,
to say whatever comes to our

00:39:01.883 --> 00:39:05.907
lips… There is a kind of
license that comes from the

00:39:05.907 --> 00:39:09.779
denial of any restraints on our
desires or a kind of

00:39:09.779 --> 00:39:14.333
relativistic belief that all
desires are equal and all should

00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:18.275
be permitted.
Plato's views on democracy were

00:39:18.275 --> 00:39:20.400
not all negative,
to be sure.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.210
He wasn't only a critic of
democracy.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.285
It was, after all,
a democracy that produced

00:39:27.285 --> 00:39:31.289
Socrates and allowed him to
philosophize freely until his

00:39:31.289 --> 00:39:34.477
seventieth year.
Would this have been permitted

00:39:34.477 --> 00:39:36.820
in any other city of the ancient
world?

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.732
And he surely would not be
allowed to philosophize in many

00:39:42.732 --> 00:39:48.183
cities and countries today.
Remember the letter that Plato

00:39:48.183 --> 00:39:53.152
wrote near the end of his life,
when he compares the democracy

00:39:53.152 --> 00:39:56.871
to a golden age,
at least in comparison to what

00:39:56.871 --> 00:40:00.101
went after.
Plato here seems to agree with

00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:04.982
Winston Churchill that democracy
is the worst regime except for

00:40:04.982 --> 00:40:06.400
all the others.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.737
It's the worst that's been
tried except for everything

00:40:15.737 --> 00:40:17.780
else.
So what is the function of

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.530
Kallipolis, this perfect,
this beautiful city?

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:24.648
What purpose does it serve?
The philosopher-king,

00:40:24.648 --> 00:40:28.358
he tells us,
may be an object of hope or

00:40:28.358 --> 00:40:33.877
wish but Plato realizes that
this possibility is not really

00:40:33.877 --> 00:40:37.667
to be expected.
The philosophic city is

00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:42.755
introduced as a metaphor to help
us understand the education of

00:40:42.755 --> 00:40:46.219
the soul.
The reform of politics may not

00:40:46.219 --> 00:40:51.014
be within our power but the
exercise of self-control always

00:40:51.014 --> 00:40:54.139
is.
The first responsibility of the

00:40:54.139 --> 00:40:59.482
individual who wishes to engage
in political reform is to reform

00:40:59.482 --> 00:41:05.191
themselves.
All reform seems to begin at

00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:08.643
home.
And we see this very vividly

00:41:08.643 --> 00:41:13.078
when we look at so many
politicians today in public

00:41:13.078 --> 00:41:18.222
scolds who teach us and who are
hectoring us about living a

00:41:18.222 --> 00:41:21.733
certain way of life,
living a certain,

00:41:21.733 --> 00:41:26.224
living according to their likes
and then we will find out of

00:41:26.224 --> 00:41:29.650
course something very shameful
about them.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:33.430
I'm thinking of a couple of
people in particular,

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.289
I won't mention any names in
the public sphere.

00:41:37.289 --> 00:41:43.276
Plato's judgment seems to be
"you need to reform yourself

00:41:43.276 --> 00:41:48.300
before you can think about
reforming others."

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:52.712
This is a point that is often
lost in the Republic,

00:41:52.712 --> 00:41:57.280
that it is first of all a work
on the reform of the soul.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:00.988
That is not to say at all that
it teaches withdrawal from

00:42:00.988 --> 00:42:03.769
political responsibilities,
it does not.

00:42:03.769 --> 00:42:08.037
Philosophy and certainly
Socratic philosophy requires

00:42:08.037 --> 00:42:10.909
friends, comrades,
conversations.

00:42:10.909 --> 00:42:14.769
It is not something that can
simply be pursued in isolation.

00:42:14.769 --> 00:42:19.559
Socrates understands that those
who want to reform others must

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:22.857
reform themselves,
but many who've tried to

00:42:22.857 --> 00:42:25.920
imitate him have been less
careful.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.841
It is easy to confuse,
as many people have done,

00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:33.929
the Republic, with a
recipe for tyranny.

00:42:33.929 --> 00:42:37.760
The twentieth century,
and even the beginnings of our

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.737
own, is littered with the
corpses of those who have set

00:42:41.737 --> 00:42:44.610
themselves up as
philosopher-kings,

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.620
Lenin, Stalin,
Hitler, Mao,

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:53.409
Khamenei, to name just some of
the most obvious.

00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:56.550
But these men are not
philosophers.

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.251
Their professions to justice
are just that,

00:43:00.251 --> 00:43:04.746
they are professions or
pretensions expressing their

00:43:04.746 --> 00:43:09.373
vanity and their ambition.
For Plato, philosophy was in

00:43:09.373 --> 00:43:12.916
the first instance,
a therapy for our passions in a

00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:15.750
way of setting limits to our
desires.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:19.702
And this is precisely the
opposite of the tyrant who Plato

00:43:19.702 --> 00:43:23.516
describes as a person of
limitless desires who lacks the

00:43:23.516 --> 00:43:26.290
most rudimentary kind of
governance,

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:30.344
namely self-control.
The difference between the

00:43:30.344 --> 00:43:33.929
philosopher and the tyrant
illustrate two very different

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:38.042
conceptions of philosophy.
For some, philosophy represents

00:43:38.042 --> 00:43:42.058
a form of liberation from
confusion, from unruly passions

00:43:42.058 --> 00:43:44.639
and prejudices,
from incoherence.

00:43:44.639 --> 00:43:48.738
Again, a therapy of the soul
that brings peace and

00:43:48.738 --> 00:43:51.750
contentment and a kind of
justice.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:55.580
And yet for others,
philosophy is the source of the

00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:59.778
desire to dominate.
It is the basis of tyranny in

00:43:59.778 --> 00:44:04.508
the great age of ideologies
through which we are still

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.490
passing.

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:13.507
The question is that both
tendencies are at work within

00:44:13.507 --> 00:44:18.234
philosophy and how do we
encourage one side but not the

00:44:18.234 --> 00:44:21.717
other.
As that great philosopher Karl

00:44:21.717 --> 00:44:24.933
Marx once asked,
"Who will educate the

00:44:24.933 --> 00:44:28.536
educators?"
It's the wisest thing he ever

00:44:28.536 --> 00:44:32.051
said.
Who will educate the educators,

00:44:32.051 --> 00:44:37.038
who do we turn to for help?
There is obviously no magic

00:44:37.038 --> 00:44:41.806
solution to this question but
the best answer I know of is

00:44:41.806 --> 00:44:45.194
Socrates.
He showed people how to live,

00:44:45.194 --> 00:44:49.469
and just as importantly,
he showed them how to die.

00:44:49.469 --> 00:44:55.284
He lived and died not like most
people but better,

00:44:55.284 --> 00:45:01.930
and even his most vehement
critics will admit to that.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:06.962
Thank you very much.
I'll see you next Wednesday,

00:45:06.962 --> 00:45:08.762
and we'll start Aristotle.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.930
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.248
Moving then as quickly as
possible into our subject matter

00:00:08.248 --> 00:00:13.212
for today,
we begin a series of lectures

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:19.530
on various aspects of
twentieth-century formalism--

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.630
a big word.
 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.626
At the end of our run through
the varieties of

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:30.160
twentieth-century formalism,
I hope it doesn't seem quite as

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.679
big and that its many meanings--
yet a finite number of

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:42.990
meanings--have been made clear
to you.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.285
That is to say,
what we're taking up this week,

00:00:45.285 --> 00:00:48.480
is as much really the history
of criticism as literary theory.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.245
You remember in the first
lecture I said there's a

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:52.263
difference between the history
of criticism and theory of

00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:54.872
literature,
one difference being that the

00:00:54.872 --> 00:00:58.797
history of criticism has a great
deal to do with literary

00:00:58.797 --> 00:01:03.078
evaluation: that is to say,
why do we care about literature

00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:06.885
and how can we find means of
saying that it's good or not

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:07.430
good?
 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.415
This is an aspect of thought
concerning literature that tends

00:01:11.415 --> 00:01:15.269
to fall out of literary theory
but not out of the materials

00:01:15.269 --> 00:01:17.530
that we are reading this week.
 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.849
You can see that when Wimsatt
and Beardsley talk about the

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.890
"success"
of the poem,

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.250
they understand the whole
critical enterprise,

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.188
including its theoretical
underpinnings--

00:01:27.188 --> 00:01:33.063
the question of what is a poem,
the question of how should we

00:01:33.063 --> 00:01:36.293
best read it--
to be still geared toward

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.690
literary evaluation.
 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.580
That makes the subject matter
that we'll be discussing this

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.531
week, as I say,
as much a part of the history

00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:47.550
of criticism as it is of
literary theory.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.818
We're going to be
reading it with a theoretical

00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:51.250
spin.
 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.845
That is to say,
we're going to focus on the

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:56.750
question of what a poem is and
the question,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.734
"What criteria should we
invoke in order to read it for

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.828
the best and correctly?"
 

00:02:02.828 --> 00:02:06.340
But there are other ways of
approaching this material.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.370
In any case, then, Wimsatt.
 

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.104
Beardsley by the way was
actually a philosopher who

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:14.949
taught at Temple University,
a good friend of his.

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:17.772
In the book in which the essay
"The Intentional

00:02:17.772 --> 00:02:21.186
Fallacy" appeared,
a book called The Verbal

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:24.712
Icon, Wimsatt collaborated
with Monroe Beardsley on three

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:27.348
essays,
and this is one of them.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:30.604
So we try to remember to say
"Wimsatt and

00:02:30.604 --> 00:02:33.786
Beardsley"
even though it is Wimsatt who

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.160
taught at Yale.
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.468
That in itself needn't be
significant except that the New

00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:40.865
Critics,
the school of critics to which

00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:43.794
he belonged,
have always been identified

00:02:43.794 --> 00:02:47.478
with Yale and indeed
consolidated here a kind of

00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:51.473
teaching method and attitude
toward literature which

00:02:51.473 --> 00:02:55.846
constituted the first wave--
the first of two waves--of

00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:59.625
involvement in literary theory
which amounts to the Yale

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:03.265
English and comparative
literature departments' claims

00:03:03.265 --> 00:03:04.158
to fame.
 

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:08.794
Many of those figures who
belong to the New Critics did

00:03:08.794 --> 00:03:13.860
much of their important work
before they arrived at Yale.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.174
Others never were at Yale,
and yet at the same time it's a

00:03:18.174 --> 00:03:22.110
movement closely associated with
this institution.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.870
When I arrived at Yale,
Wimsatt was still teaching,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.449
Cleanth Brooks was still
teaching, and so I feel a kind

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:35.538
of personal continuity with
these figures and understand,

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:38.220
as we all will more fully later
on,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.780
the way in which the style,
and emphasis on the style,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.912
of close reading that evolved
within the New Criticism

00:03:47.912 --> 00:03:52.591
meaningfully and importantly
left its mark on much subsequent

00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:57.502
criticism and theory that hasn't
in fact always acknowledged the

00:03:57.502 --> 00:04:02.258
New Criticism perhaps to the
extent that it might have.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:06.447
Much of this should be reserved
for next time when I talk about

00:04:06.447 --> 00:04:10.229
Cleanth Brooks and return to the
whole subject of the New

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:14.348
Criticism and the way in which
it's viewed historically--

00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:17.339
so much of it can be reserved
for next time.

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:19.410
But what I do want to say now
is this.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.834
If it weren't for the New
Critics, none of you probably

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:26.386
would have been able to sit
patiently through any of your

00:04:26.386 --> 00:04:29.050
middle or high school English
classes.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.059
When Cleanth Brooks and Robert
Penn Warren published a book

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:37.545
called Understanding Poetry,
first published in 1939 and

00:04:37.545 --> 00:04:41.887
then subsequently reissued again
and again and again as it swept

00:04:41.887 --> 00:04:45.745
the country,
suddenly schoolteachers had a

00:04:45.745 --> 00:04:51.069
way of keeping kids in the
classroom for fifty minutes.

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.584
Close reading,
the idea that you could take a

00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:58.927
text and do things with it--
that the interpretation of a

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:01.569
text wasn't just a matter of
saying,

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.007
"Oh, yes,
it's about this and isn't it

00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:06.470
beautiful?"--
reciting the text,

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.800
emoting over it,
enthusing about it,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.620
and then looking around for
something else to say--

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.949
it was no longer a question of
doing that.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.406
It was a question of
constructing an elaborate formal

00:05:18.406 --> 00:05:22.350
edifice to which everybody could
contribute.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.829
Students got excited about it.
 

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:26.875
They saw certain patterns or
certain ways of elaborating

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:29.810
patterns that the teachers were
talking about and,

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.593
lo and behold,
the fifty minutes was over and

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:35.060
everybody had had a pretty good
time.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.569
This had never happened in an
English class before.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:40.459
&gt;
 

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:42.050
&gt;
 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.673
Seriously, you're English
majors because of the New

00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:46.982
Criticism--I admit,
especially if you went to

00:05:46.982 --> 00:05:47.980
private school.
 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.062
This way of teaching did not
perhaps quite so much for a

00:05:52.062 --> 00:05:55.850
variety of reasons permeate
public school literature

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:58.026
teaching,
but it was simply,

00:05:58.026 --> 00:06:00.870
as a result of Understanding
Poetry,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.209
the way to go.
 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:04.699
It took time.
 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.016
If you had more than
fifty minutes,

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:09.389
you could actually make ample
use of it.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.951
T.S. Eliot,
who was in many ways associated

00:06:11.951 --> 00:06:14.942
with the New Criticism,
one of its intellectual

00:06:14.942 --> 00:06:18.120
forebears, nevertheless took a
somewhat dim view of it and

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.910
called it "lemon squeezer
criticism."

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.389
What this meant is it takes
time.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:27.250
You've got to squeeze
absolutely everything out of it,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.699
and so it was ideal from the
standpoint of teaching and was,

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.793
it seems to me,
also wonderfully galvanizing

00:06:34.793 --> 00:06:38.678
intellectually because it really
did make people think:

00:06:38.678 --> 00:06:43.139
"look how intricate what I
thought was simple turns out to

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:44.220
be."
 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.321
The New Criticism,
incontestably and without

00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:51.149
rival,
created an atmosphere in which

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:54.495
it was okay to notice that
things were a little more

00:06:54.495 --> 00:06:57.449
difficult than they'd been
supposed to be.

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:01.526
This in itself was
extraordinarily useful and

00:07:01.526 --> 00:07:04.625
constructive,
not just for subsequent

00:07:04.625 --> 00:07:07.783
literary theory,
I think, but for the way in

00:07:07.783 --> 00:07:12.129
which English teaching actually
can help people think better.

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:16.879
All of this the New Criticism
had a great deal to do with--

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.646
and when I talk next time about
the way in which it's been

00:07:19.646 --> 00:07:21.879
vilified for the last
&gt;

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:25.858
forty or fifty years,
naturally I will have this in

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:27.610
the back of my mind.
 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:32.762
So in any case,
where did this preoccupation

00:07:32.762 --> 00:07:36.601
with form--
because we're beginning to

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:41.869
think about the way in which
theory can preoccupy itself with

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:44.440
form--
where does it come from?

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.608
Well, needless to say,
I'm about to say it goes back

00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:48.790
to the beginning.
 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.500
When Plato writes his
Republic and devotes Book

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.036
Ten,
as I'm sure most of you know,

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:58.708
to an argument in effect
banishing the poets from the

00:07:58.708 --> 00:08:01.884
ideal republic,
part of the argument is that

00:08:01.884 --> 00:08:03.850
poets are terrible imitators.
 

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:10.000
They imitate reality as badly
as they possibly can.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.228
They are three times removed
from the ideal forms of objects

00:08:15.228 --> 00:08:16.379
in reality.
 

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:17.569
They're a hopeless mess.
 

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:18.689
They get everything wrong.
 

00:08:18.689 --> 00:08:22.334
They think that a stick
refracted in the water is

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:24.459
therefore a crooked stick.
 

00:08:24.459 --> 00:08:28.281
They are subject to every
conceivable kind of illusion,

00:08:28.281 --> 00:08:31.889
not to be trusted,
and Socrates calls them liars.

00:08:31.889 --> 00:08:33.129
Okay.
 

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:37.740
Now when Aristotle writes his
Poetics he does so--

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.053
and this is true and rewards
scrutiny if one thinks carefully

00:08:43.053 --> 00:08:47.356
about the Poetics--
he does so very consciously

00:08:47.356 --> 00:08:51.288
in refutation of Plato's
arguments in the Republic,

00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:57.586
and perhaps the keystone of
this refutation is simply this:

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:00.940
Plato says poets imitate badly.
 

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.255
Aristotle says this is a
category mistake because poets

00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:06.158
don't imitate reality.
 

00:09:06.158 --> 00:09:09.172
Poets don't imitate,
says Aristotle,

00:09:09.172 --> 00:09:10.980
things as they are.
 

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.168
They imitate things as they
should be.

00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:19.322
In other words,
the business of poets is to

00:09:19.322 --> 00:09:22.399
organize,
to bring form to bear,

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.320
on the messiness of reality
and,

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.602
in so doing,
to construct not an alternate

00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:33.328
reality in the sense that it has
nothing to do with the real

00:09:33.328 --> 00:09:34.775
world--
that is to say,

00:09:34.775 --> 00:09:36.590
it doesn't mention anything in
the real world,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.279
or it somehow or other invents
human beings made out of

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.740
chocolate or something like
that--

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:47.620
instead, it idealizes the
elements existing in the real

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:53.046
world such that its object is
something other than reality as

00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:53.860
such.
 

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.149
This is really the origin of
formalism.

00:09:57.149 --> 00:10:02.926
Aristotle is considered the
ancestor of the varying sorts of

00:10:02.926 --> 00:10:06.309
thought about form,
and it's this move,

00:10:06.309 --> 00:10:09.158
this move that he makes in the
Poetics,

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:11.850
that engenders this
possibility.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:15.629
Now turning to your sheet,
in the early,

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:18.970
early modern period the poet
and courtier,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:21.178
Sir Philip Sidney,
wrote an elegant,

00:10:21.178 --> 00:10:23.918
really wonderfully written
defense of poetry,

00:10:23.918 --> 00:10:27.178
in one edition called The
Apology for Poesie.

00:10:27.178 --> 00:10:31.274
In this edition he,
while actually a fervent

00:10:31.274 --> 00:10:36.280
admirer of Plato,
nevertheless develops this idea

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:42.284
of Aristotle with remarkable
rhetorical ingenuity and I think

00:10:42.284 --> 00:10:48.990
very impressively lays out the
case that Aristotle first makes,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.048
here in the first passage on
your sheet.

00:10:51.048 --> 00:10:54.678
Sidney's talking about the
various kinds of discourse:

00:10:54.678 --> 00:10:57.287
divinity,
hymnody, science,

00:10:57.287 --> 00:11:00.500
philosophy, history--
in other words,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:04.047
all the ways in which you can
contribute to human betterment

00:11:04.047 --> 00:11:05.308
and human welfare.
 

00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:09.163
He says in the case of all but
one of them, each discourse is a

00:11:09.163 --> 00:11:11.028
"serving science."
 

00:11:11.028 --> 00:11:14.269
That is to say,
it is subservient to the

00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:18.019
natural world;
its importance is that it

00:11:18.019 --> 00:11:20.149
refers to that world.
 

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:24.256
The first sentence of your
passage: "There is no art

00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:28.219
but one delivered to mankind
that hath not the works of

00:11:28.219 --> 00:11:31.298
nature for his principal
object."

00:11:31.298 --> 00:11:34.299
This by the way-- although what
they serve is not exactly a work

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:37.570
of nature--
is why even that which is

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.129
incontestably better than
secular poetry,

00:11:42.129 --> 00:11:46.217
in other words hymnody,
and also divine knowledge or

00:11:46.217 --> 00:11:48.332
theology--
even these fields,

00:11:48.332 --> 00:11:53.120
which are the supreme fields,
are also serving sciences.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.557
They are subservient to an idea
that they have to express,

00:11:57.557 --> 00:12:01.528
which is the idea of God,
right, and God is real.

00:12:01.528 --> 00:12:07.245
There's no sense that we're
making God up in this kind of

00:12:07.245 --> 00:12:08.470
discourse.
 

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:15.418
Sidney is a devoutly religious
person and there's no semblance

00:12:15.418 --> 00:12:21.152
of doubt in his attitude,
and yet he is saying something

00:12:21.152 --> 00:12:26.491
very special about the poet who
is somewhere in between divinity

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:30.899
and the other sorts of discourse
with which poetry is

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:34.289
traditionally in rivalry:
science,

00:12:34.289 --> 00:12:36.320
philosophy and history.
 

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.389
And he says this is what's
unique about poetry.

00:12:39.389 --> 00:12:44.702
Only the poet disdaining to be
tied to any such subjection

00:12:44.702 --> 00:12:47.985
[subjection,
in other words,

00:12:47.985 --> 00:12:53.999
to things as they are],
lifted up with the vigor of his

00:12:53.999 --> 00:12:57.796
own invention,
doth grow in effect another

00:12:57.796 --> 00:12:58.740
nature....
 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.169
He nothing affirms and
therefore never lieth.

00:13:04.169 --> 00:13:05.970
In other words, Plato is wrong.
 

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:10.195
The poet is not a liar because
he's not talking about anything

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:12.620
that's verifiable or
falsifiable.

00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:17.885
He is simply talking about the
parameters of the world he has

00:13:17.885 --> 00:13:19.730
brought into being.
 

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:22.649
Sidney thinks of it as a kind
of magic.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:27.240
He invokes, for example,
the science of astrology.

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.442
The poet, he says,
ranges freely within the zodiac

00:13:31.442 --> 00:13:32.899
of his own wit.
 

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:39.812
He also invokes the
pseudoscience of alchemy when he

00:13:39.812 --> 00:13:46.048
says that the poet inhabits a
brazen world,

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:48.960
and of this--"brazen"
means brass--

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.710
of this brazen world,
he makes a golden world.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.899
In other words,
poetry is transformational.

00:13:55.899 --> 00:14:00.152
In representing not things as
they are but things as they

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:02.809
should be, it transforms
reality.

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:04.250
All right.
 

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:06.928
So this is an argument which in
outline,

00:14:06.928 --> 00:14:12.509
once again, justifies the idea
of literature as form,

00:14:12.509 --> 00:14:17.965
as that which brings form to
bear on the chaos and messiness

00:14:17.965 --> 00:14:19.259
of the real.
 

00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:25.148
Now I don't mean to say things
just stood still as Sidney said

00:14:25.148 --> 00:14:28.428
they were until you get to Kant.
 

00:14:28.428 --> 00:14:32.188
A great deal happens,
but one aspect of Kant's famous

00:14:32.188 --> 00:14:35.442
"Copernican
revolution" in

00:14:35.442 --> 00:14:39.346
the history of philosophy
is his ideas about

00:14:39.346 --> 00:14:43.828
aesthetics and the beautiful and
about the special faculty that

00:14:43.828 --> 00:14:47.589
he believes has to do with and
mediates our aesthetic

00:14:47.589 --> 00:14:51.285
understanding of things,
a faculty which he calls

00:14:51.285 --> 00:14:54.613
"the judgment";
so that in The Critique of

00:14:54.613 --> 00:14:58.721
Judgment of 1790,
he outlines a philosophy of the

00:14:58.721 --> 00:15:03.347
beautiful and of the means
whereby "the judgment"

00:15:03.347 --> 00:15:06.220
makes judgments of the
beautiful.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.547
He does a great deal else in
it, but I'm isolating this

00:15:09.547 --> 00:15:13.428
strand, which is what's relevant
to what we're talking about.

00:15:13.428 --> 00:15:16.804
In many ways Kant,
without knowing anything about

00:15:16.804 --> 00:15:20.672
Sidney, nevertheless follows
from Sidney particularly in

00:15:20.672 --> 00:15:22.360
this, as you'll see.
 

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.351
I'm going to look sort of with
some care at these passages so

00:15:25.351 --> 00:15:28.136
all will become clear,
but particularly in this:

00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:31.457
Sidney--and I didn't exactly
quote the passage in which

00:15:31.457 --> 00:15:35.210
Sidney does this but I urged you
to believe that he does--

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.511
Sidney actually ranks poetry
somewhere between divinity and

00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:41.070
the other sciences.
 

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.423
In other words,
poetry is not the supreme thing

00:15:44.423 --> 00:15:46.100
that a person can do.
 

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.582
Sidney believed this so much in
fact that when he knew himself

00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:52.217
to be dying,
having been mortally wounded in

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:54.597
a battle,
he ordered that all of his own

00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:55.590
poems be burned.
 

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.706
From the standpoint of a devout
person, he had no doubt that

00:15:59.706 --> 00:16:02.080
poetry was inferior to divinity.
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.808
Now in a way that's what Kant's
saying, too.

00:16:05.808 --> 00:16:10.412
In the passages you'll read,
you'll see that the point is

00:16:10.412 --> 00:16:15.342
not that art and the judgment of
the beautiful is the supreme

00:16:15.342 --> 00:16:18.960
thing that humanity can be
engaged with.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:23.621
The point is only that it has a
special characteristic that

00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:25.149
nothing else has.
 

00:16:25.149 --> 00:16:29.815
That's the point that this
whole tradition is trying to

00:16:29.815 --> 00:16:30.418
make.
 

00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:33.303
This is the way Kant puts it,
turning first to the second

00:16:33.303 --> 00:16:36.679
passage:
The pleasant and the good both

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:42.394
have a reference to the faculty
of desire [The pleasant is the

00:16:42.394 --> 00:16:46.889
way in which our appetency,
our sensuous faculty--which

00:16:46.889 --> 00:16:49.245
Kant calls "the
understanding,"

00:16:49.245 --> 00:16:51.879
by the way--
understands things.

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:55.038
Things are either pleasant or
unpleasant.

00:16:55.038 --> 00:16:58.292
The good, on the contrary,
is the way in which our

00:16:58.292 --> 00:17:01.395
cognitive and moral faculty--
which Kant calls "the

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:03.610
reason"--
understands things.

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.868
Things are either to be
approved of or not to be

00:17:06.868 --> 00:17:09.366
approved of,
but in each case,

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:13.053
as Kant argues,
they have a reference to the

00:17:13.053 --> 00:17:16.865
faculty of desire--
I want, I don't want,

00:17:16.865 --> 00:17:21.490
I approve, I disapprove],
and they bring with them the

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:24.396
former [that is to say,
the pleasant],

00:17:24.396 --> 00:17:27.430
a satisfaction pathologically
conditioned;

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.990
the latter a pure,
practical, purposeful

00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:36.834
satisfaction which is determined
not merely by the representation

00:17:36.834 --> 00:17:41.499
of the object [that is to say,
by the fact that the

00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:44.068
represented object exists for
me,

00:17:44.068 --> 00:17:47.021
right]
but also by the represented

00:17:47.021 --> 00:17:52.479
connection of the subject with
the existence of the object [in

00:17:52.479 --> 00:17:56.150
other words,
by the way in which I want it

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.902
or don't want it,
approve of it or don't approve

00:17:58.902 --> 00:17:59.259
of it].
 

00:17:59.259 --> 00:18:01.720
My subjective wishes,
in other words,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.464
determine my attitude toward
it, whereas what Kant is saying

00:18:06.464 --> 00:18:11.532
is that my attitude toward that
which simply stands before us as

00:18:11.532 --> 00:18:14.670
what is neither pleasant nor
good,

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:21.220
but is rather something else,
doesn't exist for me.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.798
It exists in and for itself.
 

00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:28.355
The next passage:
"Taste is the faculty of

00:18:28.355 --> 00:18:32.992
the judging of an object or a
method of representing it by an

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:35.853
entirely disinterested
satisfaction or

00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:39.950
dissatisfaction." 
In other words,

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.410
yeah, I still like it or don't
like it,

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:48.348
but my liking has nothing to do
either with desire or with

00:18:48.348 --> 00:18:50.740
approval--
moral, political,

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.618
or however the case may be.
 

00:18:52.618 --> 00:18:56.539
I just like it or I just don't
like it according to principles

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:59.883
that can be understood as
arising from the faculty of

00:18:59.883 --> 00:19:03.740
judgment and not from the
faculty of the understanding,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.039
which is appetitive,
and the faculty of reason,

00:19:06.039 --> 00:19:07.900
which is moral.
 

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:13.788
So with that said,
perhaps just to add to that,

00:19:13.788 --> 00:19:18.067
the fourth passage:
"Beauty is the form of the

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:22.942
purposiveness of an object so
far as it is perceived in it

00:19:22.942 --> 00:19:27.220
without any representation of a
purpose."

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:30.289
You say, "Whoa,
what is this?"

00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.869
&gt;
 

00:19:30.869 --> 00:19:31.788
&gt;
 

00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:35.980
Kant makes a distinction
between the purposive and the

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.009
purposeful.
 

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:38.420
What is the distinction?
 

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.932
The purposeful is the purpose
of the object in practical

00:19:42.932 --> 00:19:43.589
terms.
 

00:19:43.589 --> 00:19:45.049
What can it do?
 

00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:47.000
What can it do for me?
 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.450
How does it go to work in the
world?

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:53.529
What is its function among
other objects?

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:58.538
What bearing does it have
on--in particular--my life?

00:19:58.538 --> 00:20:04.877
But the purposiveness of the
object is the way in which it is

00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:07.519
sufficient unto itself.
 

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:11.901
It has its own purpose,
which is not a purpose that has

00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:15.390
any bearing necessarily on
anything else.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:19.788
It has, in other words,
an internal coherence.

00:20:19.788 --> 00:20:25.842
It has a dynamism of parts that
is strictly with reference to

00:20:25.842 --> 00:20:27.859
its own existence.
 

00:20:27.859 --> 00:20:29.420
It is a form.
 

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.609
It is a form and that form,
because we can see it has

00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:38.041
structure and because we can see
it has organization and

00:20:38.041 --> 00:20:40.380
complexity, is purposive.
 

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:44.570
That is to say,
it manifests its

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:47.140
self-sufficiency.
 

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.788
So that's Kant's famous
distinction between the

00:20:50.788 --> 00:20:54.404
purposive,
which is the organization of an

00:20:54.404 --> 00:20:57.818
aesthetic object,
and the purposeful,

00:20:57.818 --> 00:21:03.595
which is the organization of
any object insofar as it goes to

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:06.578
work in the world or for us.
 

00:21:06.578 --> 00:21:10.910
An aesthetic object can
be purposeful;

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:14.098
that is to say we can view it
as purposeful.

00:21:14.098 --> 00:21:17.897
I see a naked body,
which the art historians call a

00:21:17.897 --> 00:21:18.430
nude.
 

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.308
Let's say I don't accept that
it's merely a nude.

00:21:21.308 --> 00:21:24.971
I want it or I disapprove of it
and, lo and behold,

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:26.950
it's no longer aesthetic.
 

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.808
I'll come back to that in a
moment, but I hope you can see

00:21:30.808 --> 00:21:34.534
that that is a distinction
between the purposive and the

00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:35.548
purposeful.
 

00:21:35.548 --> 00:21:40.808
Now just in order to reprise
these important distinctions,

00:21:40.808 --> 00:21:46.450
I want to turn to a passage in
Samuel Coleridge who is,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.140
at least on this occasion,
a disciple of Kant and is,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:54.262
I think, usefully paraphrasing
the arguments of Kant that we

00:21:54.262 --> 00:21:56.220
have just been engaged in.
 

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:59.068
This is the fifth passage on
your sheet:

00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:03.141
The beautiful [says Coleridge]
is at once distinguished both

00:22:03.141 --> 00:22:07.144
from the agreeable which is
beneath it [and notice the sort

00:22:07.144 --> 00:22:11.214
of stationing of the beautiful
as Sidney stations it between

00:22:11.214 --> 00:22:14.390
what's beneath it and what's
above it]--

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.892
from the agreeable which is
beneath it and from the good

00:22:17.892 --> 00:22:21.876
which is above it,
for both these necessarily have

00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:24.440
an interest attached to them.
 

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:29.550
Both act on the will and excite
a desire for the actual

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:34.000
existence of the image or idea
contemplated,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.779
while the sense of beauty rests
gratified in the mere

00:22:38.779 --> 00:22:43.559
contemplation or intuition
regardless whether it be a

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:47.328
fictitious Apollo or a real
Antinous.

00:22:47.328 --> 00:22:51.930
In other words,
the judgment of beauty does not

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:58.029
depend on the existence of the
object for its satisfaction.

00:22:58.029 --> 00:23:01.714
Now Oscar Wilde,
ever the wag and a person who

00:23:01.714 --> 00:23:06.547
generated more good literary
theory in ways that didn't seem

00:23:06.547 --> 00:23:10.961
like literary theory at all,
perhaps, in the entire history

00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:14.770
of thinking about the subject,
says in the famous series of

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:18.238
aphorisms which constitute his
"Preface"

00:23:18.238 --> 00:23:21.140
to The Picture of Dorian
Gray--

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.009
he concludes this series of
aphorisms by winking at us and

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:27.472
saying,
"All art is quite

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:28.690
useless."
 

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:33.301
I hope that after reading these
passages and enduring the

00:23:33.301 --> 00:23:38.327
explication of them that you've
just heard you can immediately

00:23:38.327 --> 00:23:43.269
see what Wilde means by saying
all art is quite useless.

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:49.319
He's appropriating a term of
opprobrium in the utilitarian

00:23:49.319 --> 00:23:51.375
tradition--
oh, my goodness,

00:23:51.375 --> 00:23:52.808
that something would be
useless,

00:23:52.808 --> 00:23:57.454
right?–he's appropriating
a term of opprobrium and

00:23:57.454 --> 00:24:02.017
pointing out that it is an
extraordinarily unique thing

00:24:02.017 --> 00:24:06.135
about art that it's useless;
in other words,

00:24:06.135 --> 00:24:11.327
that it appeals to no merely
appetitive or other form of

00:24:11.327 --> 00:24:13.500
subjective interest.
 

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:16.509
We don't have to have an
"interest"

00:24:16.509 --> 00:24:19.480
in it in the sense of owning
part of a company.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.009
We don't have to have an
interest in it in order to

00:24:24.009 --> 00:24:25.460
appreciate it.
 

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.759
In other words,
we can be objective about it.

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:34.740
We can distance ourselves from
our subjective wants and needs

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:40.468
and likes and dislikes,
and we can coexist with it in a

00:24:40.468 --> 00:24:47.029
happy and constructive way that
is good for both of us,

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:52.951
because if we recognize that
there are things in the world

00:24:52.951 --> 00:24:58.873
which have intrinsic value and
importance and what we call

00:24:58.873 --> 00:25:02.755
beauty,
and yet are not the things that

00:25:02.755 --> 00:25:08.665
we covet or wish to banish,
we recognize in ourselves the

00:25:08.665 --> 00:25:12.470
capacity for disinterestedness.
 

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:17.077
We recognize in ourselves a
virtue which is considered to be

00:25:17.077 --> 00:25:21.528
the cornerstone of many systems
of moral understanding.

00:25:21.528 --> 00:25:25.730
To realize that we're not
interested in everything and

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.250
merely because we're interested
take a view of things,

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:36.259
but that there are things that
we don't have to have that kind

00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:40.888
of interest in and can
nevertheless recognize as

00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:45.519
self-sufficient and valuable,
is important.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:48.598
Wilde's suggestion,
but I think also Kant's

00:25:48.598 --> 00:25:51.680
suggestion before him,
is important for our

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.098
recognition of our own value.
 

00:25:54.098 --> 00:25:58.247
By the same token,
all this harping on the

00:25:58.247 --> 00:26:01.240
autonomy of art--
that is to say,

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:05.215
the self-sufficiency of art,
the way in which it's not

00:26:05.215 --> 00:26:08.571
dependent on anything,
or as Sidney says,

00:26:08.571 --> 00:26:13.703
the way in which it's not a
serving science existing merely

00:26:13.703 --> 00:26:17.420
to represent things other than
itself,

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.880
right?--the way in which this
is possible for art is,

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:27.098
as also our own capacity to be
disinterested is,

00:26:27.098 --> 00:26:32.432
a way of acknowledging that
freedom exists:

00:26:32.432 --> 00:26:38.276
that I am free,
that things are free from my

00:26:38.276 --> 00:26:44.592
instrumental interest in them,
so that in general what's

00:26:44.592 --> 00:26:50.269
implicit in this view of art and
this view of human judgment,

00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:54.160
and what makes it so important
in the history of thought,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.032
is that once again--and this is
not the first time we've brought

00:26:58.032 --> 00:27:01.170
this up in these lectures and
won't be the last--

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:06.643
it's a way of recognizing that
in addition to all the other

00:27:06.643 --> 00:27:12.230
things that we are,
some of them wonderful,

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.980
we are also free.
 

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:22.144
There is in us at least an
element that is free,

00:27:22.144 --> 00:27:26.413
independent,
serving nothing,

00:27:26.413 --> 00:27:28.700
autonomous.
 

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:34.797
This idea of our freedom,
and by implication of the

00:27:34.797 --> 00:27:41.406
freedom of other things,
from our instrumental interests

00:27:41.406 --> 00:27:46.009
is what sustains the formalist
tradition,

00:27:46.009 --> 00:27:51.432
and against various kinds of
criticism and objection that

00:27:51.432 --> 00:27:56.180
we'll be taking up in turn as
the case arises,

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:04.034
sustains and keeps bringing
back into the history of thought

00:28:04.034 --> 00:28:11.488
on these subjects the notion
that form simply for its own

00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:14.876
sake--
as the notorious Aestheticism

00:28:14.876 --> 00:28:18.779
movement at the end of the
nineteenth century put it--

00:28:18.779 --> 00:28:20.160
is valuable.
 

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.710
All right.
 

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.343
Now John Crowe Ransom,
who was never at Yale but is

00:28:26.343 --> 00:28:31.253
nevertheless one of the founders
or first members of a

00:28:31.253 --> 00:28:36.258
self-identified school of
figures who called themselves

00:28:36.258 --> 00:28:39.930
the New Critics,
published a book called The

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.009
New Criticism, and
that's &gt;

00:28:43.009 --> 00:28:45.992
where the term "the New
Critics"

00:28:45.992 --> 00:28:46.940
comes from.
 

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.220
You may have noticed in your
Wimsatt essay that there is a

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.558
footnote to somebody named Joel
Spingarn who wrote an essay

00:28:53.558 --> 00:28:55.574
called "The New
Criticism"

00:28:55.574 --> 00:28:56.380
in 1924.
 

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.308
Not to worry.
 

00:28:57.308 --> 00:28:58.960
That has nothing to do with the
New Criticism.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.016
That just means criticism which
is recent,

00:29:01.016 --> 00:29:02.220
&gt;
 

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.068
a different matter altogether.
 

00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:08.087
By the same token,
there is the work of Roland

00:29:08.087 --> 00:29:11.838
Barthes and some of his
contemporaries--

00:29:11.838 --> 00:29:16.000
Poulet, whom I mentioned,
Jean Starobinski and others--

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.717
that was called in the French
press La Nouvelle

00:29:18.717 --> 00:29:19.548
Critique.
 

00:29:19.548 --> 00:29:24.309
That, too then is an instance
of the New Criticism being used

00:29:24.309 --> 00:29:29.150
as a term, but that too has
nothing to do with our subject.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:32.000
The New Critics,
the American New Critics as

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.323
they are sometimes identified,
were a school--and I use that

00:29:36.323 --> 00:29:40.808
term advisedly because they are
self-identified as a group--

00:29:40.808 --> 00:29:48.094
a school of people who evolved
this idea of the independent

00:29:48.094 --> 00:29:50.896
status--
Ransom calls it a

00:29:50.896 --> 00:29:54.720
"discrete ontological
object"--

00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.365
of the work of art and the
means whereby it can be

00:30:00.365 --> 00:30:06.588
appreciated as independent in
all of its complexity.

00:30:06.588 --> 00:30:10.759
Our first foray into the
thinking of this school will be

00:30:10.759 --> 00:30:14.323
our reading of Wimsatt and
Beardsley's "The

00:30:14.323 --> 00:30:16.977
Intentional
Fallacy,"

00:30:16.977 --> 00:30:20.009
which I'll get to in a
minute;

00:30:20.009 --> 00:30:23.853
but, simply as a reprise,
take a look at the two passages

00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:28.038
from Ransom which complete
what's on your sheet and which,

00:30:28.038 --> 00:30:31.211
I think you can see,
create a link between the sort

00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:35.144
of thinking you've encountered
in reading "The Intentional

00:30:35.144 --> 00:30:38.887
Fallacy" and the
tradition that I've been trying

00:30:38.887 --> 00:30:40.029
to describe.
 

00:30:40.029 --> 00:30:44.171
Passage seven ought to be
completely transparent to you

00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:48.313
now because it is simply a
paraphrase of the passages I

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:52.838
have given you from Kant and
Coleridge: "The experience

00:30:52.838 --> 00:30:55.906
[says Ransom]
called beauty is beyond the

00:30:55.906 --> 00:31:00.278
powerful ethical will precisely
as it is beyond the animal

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:01.660
passion.
 

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:05.630
Indeed, these last two are
competitive and

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.470
coordinate."
 

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.009
In other words,
what they have in common with

00:31:10.009 --> 00:31:12.492
each other, ethical will and
animal passion,

00:31:12.492 --> 00:31:15.150
is that they're both grounded
in interest.

00:31:15.150 --> 00:31:15.848
Right?
 

00:31:15.848 --> 00:31:18.411
That's the point of Sir Kenneth
Clark's word,

00:31:18.411 --> 00:31:19.633
"the nude."
 

00:31:19.633 --> 00:31:22.368
&lt;&lt;pronounced
"nyewd"&gt;&gt;

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:28.996
For the naked human being,
as viewed both by the appetites

00:31:28.996 --> 00:31:33.134
and by moral reason,
as a common term from the

00:31:33.134 --> 00:31:35.653
standpoint both of what Kant
calls "the

00:31:35.653 --> 00:31:38.173
understanding"
and from what Kant calls

00:31:38.173 --> 00:31:41.042
"the reason,"
the expression "naked

00:31:41.042 --> 00:31:45.633
body" is just fine;
but if we do believe there is

00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:48.417
another category,
the aesthetic,

00:31:48.417 --> 00:31:51.737
viewed by an independent
faculty called "the

00:31:51.737 --> 00:31:54.779
judgment,"
we need another word for what

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.965
we're looking at--
modern painters like Philip

00:31:57.965 --> 00:32:01.160
Pearlstein and Lucian Freud
would strongly disagree,

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.490
but in a way that's the point.
 

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:05.123
When we're looking at a
painting of a naked body

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.928
we don't say,
"Oh, that's a naked

00:32:06.928 --> 00:32:07.660
body."
 

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.548
We say, "That's a
nyewd," and that

00:32:11.548 --> 00:32:16.217
distinction is what,
as it were, bears out the

00:32:16.217 --> 00:32:19.480
implicit way,
the semiconscious way,

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:24.147
in which all of us acknowledge
there to be a category that we

00:32:24.147 --> 00:32:26.558
call the aesthetic judgment.
 

00:32:26.558 --> 00:32:29.313
On the other hand,
a lot of people think it's all

00:32:29.313 --> 00:32:31.674
hokum,
and in fact the predominant

00:32:31.674 --> 00:32:35.640
view in the twentieth century
has been that there's no such

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.984
thing as disinterestedness,
that whatever we are looking at

00:32:40.984 --> 00:32:45.460
we have an interest in and form
views of,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:50.301
and that this Kantian moment of
dispassionate or disinterested

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:54.669
contemplation is what the early
twentieth-century critic

00:32:54.669 --> 00:32:58.241
I.A. Richards called a
"phantom aesthetic

00:32:58.241 --> 00:32:59.828
state."
 

00:32:59.828 --> 00:33:03.102
The predominant view is of this
kind of--but,

00:33:03.102 --> 00:33:06.894
just to do it justice in
passing, there is a certain

00:33:06.894 --> 00:33:08.680
sense, is there not?
 

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.680
in which we suddenly find
ourselves,

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.209
without meaning to and without
being simply victims of any sort

00:33:15.209 --> 00:33:18.444
of cultural tyranny,
standing in front of something,

00:33:18.444 --> 00:33:21.392
clasping our hands,
tilting our head and feeling

00:33:21.392 --> 00:33:25.176
somehow or another different
from the way we feel when we

00:33:25.176 --> 00:33:27.068
typically look at things.
 

00:33:27.068 --> 00:33:30.858
And that, too,
is an intuitive way of saying,

00:33:30.858 --> 00:33:36.440
"Yeah, however rigorously
we can define it or defend it,

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.661
something like this does seem
to go on in our minds at certain

00:33:40.661 --> 00:33:43.358
kinds of moments of
experience."

00:33:43.358 --> 00:33:48.823
We just feel differently
looking at a certain work of art

00:33:48.823 --> 00:33:54.089
or a certain landscape,
let's say, than we feel looking

00:33:54.089 --> 00:33:56.920
at other sorts of things.
 

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.828
Maybe we don't know why.
 

00:33:58.828 --> 00:34:01.781
Maybe we doubt that the
difference is absolute in the

00:34:01.781 --> 00:34:03.940
way that Kant wants to insist it
is.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:06.670
Nevertheless,
we have in tendency feelings of

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:10.268
this kind and we should
acknowledge them because again,

00:34:10.268 --> 00:34:16.885
at least in terms of a weak
understanding of these

00:34:16.885 --> 00:34:21.820
positions,
it does tend to justify them.

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:25.525
At least it explains to us why
people can have had such

00:34:25.525 --> 00:34:26.280
thoughts.
 

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:26.889
Okay.
 

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:34.469
Wimsatt--I keep saying Wimsatt.
 

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.809
Again it's Wimsatt and
Beardsley, but I already

00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:38.030
explained how that is.
 

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.137
Wimsatt right off the bat
attacks what he calls "the

00:34:42.137 --> 00:34:45.440
Romantic understanding of
literature."

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.768
Now what does he mean by
Romantic?

00:34:47.768 --> 00:34:50.405
It's the attitude which
supposes that a

00:34:50.405 --> 00:34:53.733
"poem,"
and that's Wimsatt's privileged

00:34:53.733 --> 00:34:58.472
word which I'll try to explain,
that a poem is an

00:34:58.472 --> 00:35:03.001
expression--
that is to say,

00:35:03.001 --> 00:35:09.434
is the expression of some
passion or profound genius

00:35:09.434 --> 00:35:15.884
working its way into a form,
but that the important thing is

00:35:15.884 --> 00:35:17.130
the expression.
 

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:20.652
This much, by the way,
Wimsatt has in common with

00:35:20.652 --> 00:35:22.860
Gadamer,
because Gadamer doesn't talk

00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:26.014
much about authors either,
and Gadamer is interested in

00:35:26.014 --> 00:35:28.634
what he calls meaning,
the subject matter,

00:35:28.634 --> 00:35:29.690
die Sache.
 

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:30.690
Right?
 

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.918
He's not interested in
your sort of expression

00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:37.518
of that meaning or my
expression of that meaning.

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:41.036
He's interested in the way in
which a reader can come to terms

00:35:41.036 --> 00:35:43.170
with a meaning conveyed by a
text,

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:45.170
and that much,
as I say, despite the

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:47.969
profoundly different nature of
their projects,

00:35:47.969 --> 00:35:51.059
Wimsatt and Gadamer have in
common.

00:35:51.059 --> 00:35:56.920
So a poem is not an expression
but an independent object with a

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.726
self-contained meaning,
and if this meaning is not

00:36:01.726 --> 00:36:07.054
self-evident to the attentive
reader then we don't judge the

00:36:07.054 --> 00:36:08.679
poem a success.
 

00:36:08.679 --> 00:36:11.210
This is where evaluation comes
in.

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:17.402
The success or failure of a
poem depends on the realization

00:36:17.402 --> 00:36:18.789
of meaning.
 

00:36:18.789 --> 00:36:22.309
It doesn't depend on our going
to the archive,

00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:25.889
finding out what the author
said in his letters about it,

00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:27.989
finding out what he told his
friends,

00:36:27.989 --> 00:36:29.510
or what he told the newspapers.
 

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.800
It doesn't involve any of that.
 

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:37.041
If the meaning is not clear in
the poem, we judge the poem a

00:36:37.041 --> 00:36:37.929
failure.
 

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:42.360
We don't refer--we have no
reason to refer,

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.679
if we respect the autonomy of
the poem as such,

00:36:46.679 --> 00:36:52.518
we don't refer--we don't appeal
to an authorial intention.

00:36:52.518 --> 00:36:56.498
Hence, on page 811,
the left-hand column,

00:36:56.498 --> 00:37:00.797
about a third of the way down:
"…

00:37:00.797 --> 00:37:05.085
[T]he design or intention of
the author is neither available

00:37:05.085 --> 00:37:09.664
nor desirable as a standard for
judging the success of a work of

00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:16.235
literary art…"
It follows from this that even

00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:19.815
a short poem,
even a short lyric poem--and

00:37:19.815 --> 00:37:22.623
here you could see
Wimsatt "following"

00:37:22.623 --> 00:37:24.789
Foucault,
though obviously not following

00:37:24.789 --> 00:37:27.273
but anticipating Foucault,
and again they have nothing to

00:37:27.273 --> 00:37:30.771
do with each other,
but there is this overlap--even

00:37:30.771 --> 00:37:34.650
a short poem doesn't really have
an author.

00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:41.659
It has a "speaker,"
a figure speaking in the poem,

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:44.469
that needs to be understood
dramatically,

00:37:44.469 --> 00:37:48.804
that is to say as though the
poem were one of Browning's or

00:37:48.804 --> 00:37:52.840
T.S. Eliot's dramatic
monologues--in other words,

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:58.405
so that the speaker of any poem
on Wimsatt's view is a speaker

00:37:58.405 --> 00:38:01.690
endowed with a certain
character,

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.081
a certain viewpoint,
a certain argument to be put

00:38:05.081 --> 00:38:07.855
forward,
and our concern about the

00:38:07.855 --> 00:38:12.565
speaker has to be a concern
within the poem about the way in

00:38:12.565 --> 00:38:15.679
which this character is
elaborated,

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:19.105
and not reinforced,
somehow, by biographical

00:38:19.105 --> 00:38:23.565
reference to that which is not
the speaker but the author

00:38:23.565 --> 00:38:27.550
standing back there somewhere
behind the poem.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:34.150
Now why focus on the
"poem"?

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.039
Notice that we never hear about
literature.

00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:40.250
We never even hear about
"poetry."

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:45.666
The object of attention for an
analysis of this kind is the

00:38:45.666 --> 00:38:46.320
poem.
 

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:50.541
Well, the poem is,
as John Donne puts it,

00:38:50.541 --> 00:38:53.920
a little world made cunningly.
 

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.949
It's a microcosm.
 

00:38:55.949 --> 00:38:59.510
It is a distillation or
quintessence.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:04.364
It is a model in other words
for the way in which literature

00:39:04.364 --> 00:39:07.409
can be understood as
world-making--

00:39:07.409 --> 00:39:11.411
not a representation,
again, of things as they are

00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:16.657
but of things as they should be;
whereby "things as they

00:39:16.657 --> 00:39:20.710
should be"
is not necessarily an ideal but

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:25.376
rather that which is formal,
that which is organized,

00:39:25.376 --> 00:39:28.838
and that which has a coherence
and makes sense

00:39:28.838 --> 00:39:31.840
self-sufficiently and within
itself.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.815
That's why the poem,
the lyric poem,

00:39:34.815 --> 00:39:40.000
is privileged among the forms
of literary discourse in the New

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.190
Criticism.
 

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.896
All literature is by
implication a "poem,"

00:39:43.896 --> 00:39:45.170
&gt;
 

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:51.099
but the poem is the privileged
site of analysis whereby this

00:39:51.099 --> 00:39:55.922
broader statement can be made to
seem reasonable,

00:39:55.922 --> 00:39:59.440
hence the emphasis on the poem.
 

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:03.626
The absence of the Romantic
word "poetry"

00:40:03.626 --> 00:40:06.389
is therefore not insignificant.
 

00:40:06.389 --> 00:40:09.099
Poetry is that which just sort
of spills out of me.

00:40:09.099 --> 00:40:13.309
It's the spontaneous overflow
of powerful feelings.

00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:14.239
(Never mind that.)
 

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:17.670
The New Criticism isn't
interested in spontaneous

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:20.030
overflows of powerful feelings.
 

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.106
Wimsatt has his little joke
about drinking a pint of beer,

00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:23.969
taking a walk.
 

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:28.963
So the New Criticism just isn't
interested in those sorts of

00:40:28.963 --> 00:40:30.909
spontaneous overflow.
 

00:40:30.909 --> 00:40:32.260
Sorry.
 

00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:32.860
&gt;
 

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.880
I won't go there.
 

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.489
&gt;
 

00:40:34.489 --> 00:40:40.230
But in any case, he goes on.
 

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:43.000
He goes on to say,
"All right.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.369
If we're focused on the work of
art in and of itself,

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:49.784
on the poem,
we obviously in thinking about

00:40:49.784 --> 00:40:54.175
what it means need to come to
terms with three kinds of

00:40:54.175 --> 00:40:55.719
evidence."
 

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:58.402
That is to say,
some things have a bearing on

00:40:58.402 --> 00:41:00.719
what it means and some things
don't.

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:03.659
What does have a bearing is
language--

00:41:03.659 --> 00:41:07.201
that is to say,
words in the public domain

00:41:07.201 --> 00:41:12.643
which all of us share and which
we can study in order to come to

00:41:12.643 --> 00:41:16.530
terms with the exact meaning of
the poem.

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.306
A certain word--this is,
of course, what kept you in

00:41:19.306 --> 00:41:22.739
your high school classes for so
long--a certain word has five or

00:41:22.739 --> 00:41:24.210
six different meanings.
 

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.630
The New Criticism delights in
showing how all five or six of

00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:30.878
those meanings do have some
bearing on the meaning of the

00:41:30.878 --> 00:41:31.400
poem.
 

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.268
That's all legitimate evidence.
 

00:41:33.268 --> 00:41:37.529
That is what one uses to build
up the structure of the

00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:39.860
interpretation of the poem.
 

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.976
What is not relevant is what
I've mentioned already:

00:41:43.976 --> 00:41:48.579
what the author said about the
poem in letters to friends,

00:41:48.579 --> 00:41:50.840
to newspapers and so on.
 

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.659
That has no relevance.
 

00:41:52.659 --> 00:41:56.373
Then Wimsatt acknowledges that
there's a sort of messy third

00:41:56.373 --> 00:41:59.900
category of evidence which has
to do with language and is

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.809
therefore legitimate to a point,
but also has to do with the

00:42:03.809 --> 00:42:06.152
author's idiosyncrasies--
that is to say,

00:42:06.152 --> 00:42:08.900
the way that author in
particular used language,

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:12.173
certain coterie words,
or simply a private

00:42:12.173 --> 00:42:15.050
misunderstanding of certain
words.

00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:19.235
You've got to know when you're
reading Whitman what he means by

00:42:19.235 --> 00:42:20.789
"camerado."
 

00:42:20.789 --> 00:42:22.190
It's not exactly
&gt;

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:25.030
what the rest of us typically
mean when we--well,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:27.340
we don't use that word exactly,
but it's

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.760
&gt;
 

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.360
&gt;
 

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:33.601
what we typically mean when we
speak of comrades or

00:42:33.601 --> 00:42:34.510
comradeship.
 

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:37.748
In other words,
the word is loaded in ways

00:42:37.748 --> 00:42:39.351
that--
Wimsatt would probably

00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:41.748
acknowledge--
need to be taken into account

00:42:41.748 --> 00:42:44.940
if we're going to understand
what Whitman is up to.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.085
Now this is very tricky,
and he spends the rest of his

00:42:49.085 --> 00:42:53.465
essay talking about the murky
boundaries between types of

00:42:53.465 --> 00:42:56.242
evidence,
type of evidence number two

00:42:56.242 --> 00:43:00.168
which is out of play and type of
evidence number three which may

00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:03.909
be in play but has to be dealt
with in a gingerly and careful

00:43:03.909 --> 00:43:04.469
way.
 

00:43:04.469 --> 00:43:08.530
But I'm more interested,
actually,

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:13.858
in a footnote which arises from
this argument about the

00:43:13.858 --> 00:43:19.974
idiosyncratic nature of language
as a particular author may use

00:43:19.974 --> 00:43:24.280
it because the footnote says,
you know what?

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:28.018
That's just one consideration
we bring to bear on the function

00:43:28.018 --> 00:43:29.489
of language in a poem.
 

00:43:29.489 --> 00:43:33.346
This footnote,
number eleven at the bottom of

00:43:33.346 --> 00:43:37.655
page 814 over to 815,
is just about as devastating

00:43:37.655 --> 00:43:41.282
and counterintuitive a
pronouncement as is made

00:43:41.282 --> 00:43:47.202
anywhere in our entire syllabus,
the most earth-shattering

00:43:47.202 --> 00:43:54.726
pronouncement that anybody could
ever possibly make in the New

00:43:54.726 --> 00:43:56.329
Criticism.
 

00:43:56.329 --> 00:43:59.143
Well, look at this footnote:
And the history of words

00:43:59.143 --> 00:44:03.186
after a poem is written
may contribute meanings which if

00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:07.099
relevant to the original pattern
should not be ruled out by a

00:44:07.099 --> 00:44:08.989
scruple about intention.
 

00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:10.650
That is bold.
 

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:15.579
The great creator raised his
plastic arm, right?

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:19.782
Everybody knows Akenside didn't
mean polymers,

00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:24.547
but now we're all into
cyberborgs and we take all of

00:44:24.547 --> 00:44:26.789
this very seriously.
 

00:44:26.789 --> 00:44:30.085
In a way it's a tribute to the
great creator and also an

00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:33.800
acknowledgement of the fact that
the great creator lives in the

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.940
Eternal Moment.
 

00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:36.860
He's not subject to history.
 

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.570
The great creator knew in the
eighteenth century that some day

00:44:40.570 --> 00:44:42.760
plastic would mean polymer,
right?

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.179
Obviously that's one of the
divine attributes.

00:44:47.179 --> 00:44:51.360
Therefore, if the great creator
chooses to raise his prosthetic

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.806
limb,
that is simply a way of

00:44:53.806 --> 00:44:57.869
understanding what it is like to
be everything,

00:44:57.869 --> 00:45:01.480
omnipotent and omniscient in
the Eternal Moment.

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.831
In other words,
if you take Wimsatt's eleventh

00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:08.737
footnote seriously,
that is a perfectly legitimate

00:45:08.737 --> 00:45:13.425
way not to ironically undermine
Akenside's line but actually to

00:45:13.425 --> 00:45:18.036
reinforce it and to give it a
kind of formal richness which it

00:45:18.036 --> 00:45:20.230
does not otherwise have.
 

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:24.262
I realize that I'm out of time,
and so I'll begin the next

00:45:24.262 --> 00:45:28.364
lecture by talking about a poem
of Yeats called "Lapis

00:45:28.364 --> 00:45:33.034
Lazuli" written in 1935,
in which he talks about the way

00:45:33.034 --> 00:45:37.347
in which people who build up
things that have been destroyed

00:45:37.347 --> 00:45:39.539
are always "gay."
 

00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:44.025
And of course,
if we invoke intention,

00:45:44.025 --> 00:45:51.059
Yeats doesn't mean that they're
always gay in our sense.

00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:54.362
He is using the English
translation of the German

00:45:54.362 --> 00:45:58.489
word froehlich from
Nietzsche's The Gay Science.

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:02.451
Yeats is an astute and
careful reader of Nietzsche and

00:46:02.451 --> 00:46:06.760
in some ways is elaborating on
what Nietzsche says in that book

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:09.610
in his poem "Lapis
Lazuli."

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.643
At the beginning of the next
lecture we will do the same

00:46:12.643 --> 00:46:14.518
thing with the word
"gay"

00:46:14.518 --> 00:46:17.442
that we've just done with the
word "plastic"

00:46:17.442 --> 00:46:20.641
and then we will go ahead and
consider the essay of Cleanth

00:46:20.641 --> 00:46:23.619
Brooks and other aspects of the
New Criticism.

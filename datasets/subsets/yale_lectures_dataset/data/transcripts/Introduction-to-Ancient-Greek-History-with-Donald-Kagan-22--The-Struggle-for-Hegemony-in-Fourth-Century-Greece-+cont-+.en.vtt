00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.286
Professor Donald
Kagan: In the year 401 the

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:17.644
prince of Persia,
Cyrus, who was a younger son

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:25.820
and had recently succeeded the
King of Persia,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.570
Artaxerxes, his older brother,
was in power.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.198
Cyrus had always been ambitious
for achieving the job of Shah in

00:00:36.198 --> 00:00:41.039
Persia and his mother had worked
on his behalf,

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:46.342
but it hadn't paid off.
He was not prepared to accept

00:00:46.342 --> 00:00:51.693
the verdict and so he set out in
the year 401 to launch a scheme

00:00:51.693 --> 00:00:55.770
that would bring him to the
throne of Persia,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.590
and his scheme was to hire a
good sized army of Greek

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.859
mercenaries and to trick them
into becoming the army that

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:13.680
would defeat the army of his
brother Artaxerxes,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.580
and make him king.
As it turned out,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.197
one of the men who joined up on
that expedition was an Athenian

00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:26.640
cavalryman by the name of
Xenophon,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.386
and he left an account of that
experience in a work that is

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.858
called in Greek,
the Anabasis,

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:41.379
which means "the march back."
But it's the story of how

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:47.050
this body of roughly 10,000
Greek hoplite mercenaries,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.758
marched into the heart of the
Persian Empire,

00:01:50.758 --> 00:01:55.900
defeated the army of the great
king--but in the process Prince

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.620
Cyrus himself was killed and
since the whole point of the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.425
expedition was to make him king
there wasn't any point any

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:08.167
longer.
The great question--I've told

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:11.020
you about this earlier in the
semester, what should these

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.017
10,000 Greeks do?
They end up,

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:17.090
after their generals are put to
death by treachery,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.490
to elect new generals and to
fight their way out of the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.990
empire back to the Black Sea,
which was the easiest way for

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.795
them to get home,
and then to do whatever it was

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:29.810
they would do.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.834
It was a very important
event because--and I think

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.120
Xenophon's account of it was
very,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.312
very important because it
planted in the minds of many

00:02:43.312 --> 00:02:46.160
Greeks a new notion that the
vast,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.381
powerful, wealthy empire of the
Persians was remarkably

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:53.430
vulnerable, and that it was
possible,

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.598
and many thought highly
desirable, for the Greeks to

00:02:56.598 --> 00:03:00.085
turn the tables on the Persians,
to invade Persia,

00:03:00.085 --> 00:03:02.755
and to take from it,
to subdue it,

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:07.689
and to take from it the vast
wealth that the Persians had,

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.352
and we shall see down through
the years of the fourth century

00:03:12.352 --> 00:03:17.170
different speakers will come out
and speak or write urging that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.954
the Greeks do exactly this.
Isocrates, the Athenian teacher

00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:26.626
of rhetoric, was the foremost
figure who kept seeking somebody

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:31.793
who would undertake this chore.
One of the reasons that he

00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:36.750
gave for it more than once was
that Greece was suffering,

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.406
and, of course,
had been for some time,

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:43.460
from poverty produced by war
and most particularly by civil

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.374
wars between democrats and
oligarchs that became more and

00:03:47.374 --> 00:03:50.169
more common in the fourth
century,

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.150
and his solution was if you
need money, steal it.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.284
So, take it from the Persians
and that would put an end to the

00:03:58.284 --> 00:03:59.916
troubles.
Well, of course,

00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:03.019
none of the Greek city states
was capable of establishing

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.400
leadership in Greece during the
period we're studying now,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.819
so that it could carry out
Isocrates' wishes.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.647
So, he turned to a man that the
rest of the Greeks regarded as,

00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:16.610
or many of the Greeks regarded
as a barbarian,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.043
the King of Macedon Philip,
and urged him to take on that

00:04:21.043 --> 00:04:25.793
course, and apparently whether
it was Isocrates or simply the

00:04:25.793 --> 00:04:30.180
idea itself,
Philip himself did intend to do

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.709
exactly that,
to conquer the Persian Empire,

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:39.703
but he was killed before he
could do it and the job was left

00:04:39.703 --> 00:04:43.591
to his quite young son,
Alexander, who in fact

00:04:43.591 --> 00:04:46.449
accomplished it;
but we're looking down the road.

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:51.352
Let's go back to 401 and
there we see this expedition of

00:04:51.352 --> 00:04:55.839
10,000 Greeks accomplishing what
I mentioned to you.

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.999
That there could be 10,000
Greek hoplites available for

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:02.451
such a purpose I think is a
consequence of the Peloponnesian

00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:05.510
War.
It shows us how much that war

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.870
had helped to uproot people and
to impoverish many of them,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.068
so that the idea of becoming a
mercenary soldier for a Persian

00:05:15.068 --> 00:05:19.129
prince was attractive enough to
take them away from home,

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:23.542
something that would have been
less likely in the prosperous

00:05:23.542 --> 00:05:26.310
years before the Peloponnesian
War.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.265
Well, of course,
that aside, that is a kind of a

00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:35.074
side show, it doesn't very much
affect what is happening to the

00:05:35.074 --> 00:05:39.650
Greek cities on the coast of
Asia Minor who remain the issue

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.987
as to what will happen.
You remember,

00:05:42.987 --> 00:05:47.754
these were under Athenian
control during the Peloponnesian

00:05:47.754 --> 00:05:50.670
War,
and when the war was over they

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.009
were taken over in many cases by
Lysander.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.729
What was to happen to them
ultimately still had to be

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.806
decided, because the King of
Persia claimed that territory

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:05.511
still for his own.
The Spartans had really agreed

00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.703
to that in the treaties they
made with the great king during

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:13.585
the Peloponnesian War,
but now Lysander didn't see any

00:06:13.585 --> 00:06:17.728
reason for carrying out those
promises and so there was at the

00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:21.484
very least conflict.
Of course, what the cities

00:06:21.484 --> 00:06:26.125
would have liked best of all was
to achieve autonomy for

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:31.441
themselves and they claimed that
and regarded the rule either by

00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:35.829
Persian or by Spartan as
improper and something to be

00:06:35.829 --> 00:06:39.617
resisted.
Well, Tissaphernes the

00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:44.680
satrap of the region of
Lydia and to the west,

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.686
the ones that included the
Greek cities,

00:06:47.686 --> 00:06:51.695
attacked those cities,
which he claimed for the great

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:55.009
king but which cities were
holding out.

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.059
Those cities in turn,
because the great menace to

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:02.046
them for the moment was Persian,
turned to Sparta the great

00:07:02.046 --> 00:07:05.560
victorious power,
and asked the Spartans to help.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:11.657
In the year 400 and 399 the
Spartans sent an army under a

00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:17.796
general by the name of Thibron,
who recruited about 6,000 of

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:23.524
those 10,000 men who had marched
into the Persian Empire and who

00:07:23.524 --> 00:07:28.435
still sought service as
mercenaries rather than go home

00:07:28.435 --> 00:07:32.842
to poverty,
plus about 5,000 or so

00:07:32.842 --> 00:07:37.696
Peloponnesians.
All of the overseas activities

00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:43.470
of the Spartans in these years
include practically no Spartans.

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:48.570
They are just too short of
troops to be risking them in

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.310
overseas ventures.
So, they use their

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:56.685
Peloponnesian allies,
they sometimes use mercenaries,

00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:01.900
and they also use some of these
folks I told you about the last

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.350
time who were neither this nor
that.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.233
The ones that they used on
these campaigns are the ones

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:12.110
that we are calling
neodamodes,

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:16.297
people who had been helots,
but who were liberated and

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:19.300
permitted to fight for the
Spartans,

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.705
and the notion of sending
neodamodes overseas to

00:08:22.705 --> 00:08:25.480
fight was very attractive to the
Spartans,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.985
because it got them out of
Laconia, for one thing,

00:08:28.985 --> 00:08:31.990
and provided them with soldiers
as well.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:35.954
So, that kind of army is the
one that Thibron is now using to

00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:40.188
fight against the Persians,
who just a few years ago had

00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:45.322
been the allies of the Spartans
for control of the Greek cities

00:08:45.322 --> 00:08:49.218
of Asia Minor.
Now, meanwhile we have to

00:08:49.218 --> 00:08:54.452
turn our attention to the sea,
and especially to the island of

00:08:54.452 --> 00:08:56.864
Cyprus.
It's a Persian possession,

00:08:56.864 --> 00:09:00.333
but on that island there are
some cities that have a degree

00:09:00.333 --> 00:09:04.654
of autonomy.
One of them has as its king a

00:09:04.654 --> 00:09:10.322
man called Evagoras,
and he is very ambitious for

00:09:10.322 --> 00:09:18.282
himself and for the Cypriotes,
and so he is eager to fight

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:25.503
against the Spartans,
presumably on behalf of the

00:09:25.503 --> 00:09:29.351
great king,
although his motives are not

00:09:29.351 --> 00:09:33.524
made clear by our sources.
Reasonable guess is that he may

00:09:33.524 --> 00:09:37.708
have hoped by achieving
something great for the great

00:09:37.708 --> 00:09:42.133
king he might receive back
thanks from the great king in

00:09:42.133 --> 00:09:46.279
whatever form you can imagine.
It might be allowing him to

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:48.347
rule over Cyprus,
it might mean to give him

00:09:48.347 --> 00:09:51.262
wealth,
who knows, but also on the

00:09:51.262 --> 00:09:56.666
island of Cyprus where he had
taken refuge was the Athenian

00:09:56.666 --> 00:09:59.816
Admiral Conon,
who had been one of the

00:09:59.816 --> 00:10:02.879
admirals at the final defeat at
Aegospotomi.

00:10:02.879 --> 00:10:08.146
He had escaped from that
battle and had not gone home to

00:10:08.146 --> 00:10:10.798
Athens;
he felt that the air there

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:14.494
would not be healthy for
somebody who lost the entire

00:10:14.494 --> 00:10:18.120
fleet at Aegospotomi and so he
went to Evagoras,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.009
who it took good care of Conon
and he was a great sailor.

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:27.983
One of the very most
distinguished admirals in Greek

00:10:27.983 --> 00:10:32.761
history, and he too now
continued his feeling that

00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.624
Sparta was the enemy.
So, he joined Evagoras in

00:10:37.624 --> 00:10:43.540
urging the great king to build a
navy, which would then defeat

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.812
the Spartan navy,
which would by itself rid Asia

00:10:47.812 --> 00:10:52.710
of the menace of Sparta and be a
great thing for the Persians.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:56.864
Conon, I suspect,
had some other hopes out of

00:10:56.864 --> 00:11:00.642
this activity,
which in fact will come to

00:11:00.642 --> 00:11:05.929
fruition and I'll tell you about
them in due course.

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:11.049
Well, the Spartans have their
fleet out there and the king

00:11:11.049 --> 00:11:15.629
agrees and he starts building a
fleet of his own,

00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:20.710
which will ultimately be a very
large one indeed--some 300

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.789
ships, and the king puts Conon
in charge of that fleet,

00:11:25.789 --> 00:11:29.269
which is smart in a way because
Conon is a great admiral.

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:35.080
Maybe not so smart if you look
at what Conon is really up to.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.312
In the face of these
activities, the Spartans decided

00:11:39.312 --> 00:11:44.149
to raise the ante and they sent
an expedition into Asia Minor.

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:47.995
Thibron had not done very well
and after about a year the

00:11:47.995 --> 00:11:51.841
Spartans replaced him with
another general by the name of

00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:54.149
Dercyllidas,
who does better,

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:57.399
but there's no decisive victory
out there.

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:04.956
The war is dragging on and so
they choose to send the new King

00:12:04.956 --> 00:12:09.539
Agesilaus, who is the son of
Aegis,

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:13.461
whose characteristics are among
other things,

00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:17.499
that he was born lame;
he probably would not have been

00:12:17.499 --> 00:12:20.870
allowed to live had he not come
from the royal family,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:27.570
but he did and he grew to be an
ambitious, aggressive Spartan

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:33.112
King, who I suspect--I mean,
a cheap psychology when you

00:12:33.112 --> 00:12:37.903
have a handicap like that in a
society which values physical

00:12:37.903 --> 00:12:41.903
valor and strength,
and military success so highly

00:12:41.903 --> 00:12:45.519
as the Spartans did,
you're twice as aggressive,

00:12:45.519 --> 00:12:48.639
and twice as ambitious as an
ordinary Spartan.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:51.325
In any case,
that was the way Agesilaus

00:12:51.325 --> 00:12:55.365
turned out to be.
Another interesting thing about

00:12:55.365 --> 00:13:00.650
Agesilaus is that he had been
the tent mate of Lysander and

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:05.115
it's hard to believe that
Lysander could ever have

00:13:05.115 --> 00:13:08.669
achieved the eminence that he
did,

00:13:08.669 --> 00:13:12.787
the command that was given to
him, had he not been a friend of

00:13:12.787 --> 00:13:16.500
the young man that people looked
to as the next king,

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.552
or possibly the next king.
But as yet, Agesilaus,

00:13:20.552 --> 00:13:24.780
being a much younger man than
Lysander, he seemed to be

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.556
deferential and everything was
okay and so he was very keen on

00:13:29.556 --> 00:13:34.257
doing what the Spartans did,
which was to send Agesilaus out

00:13:34.257 --> 00:13:38.355
with a new expedition to win the
war against the Persians out

00:13:38.355 --> 00:13:41.368
there.
Agesilaus, it is plain,

00:13:41.368 --> 00:13:47.940
had extremely lofty plans for
himself and for this expedition.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:55.283
The way the expedition worked,
Agesilaus chose to leave with

00:13:55.283 --> 00:14:01.756
his fleet from the town of
Aulis, which is located in

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:05.984
Boeotia.
Does anybody recognize the name

00:14:05.984 --> 00:14:11.629
and think why Agesilaus should
have wanted to leave from Aulis?

00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:13.350
Tell us about
it.Student:

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.350
[inaudible]Professor
Donald Kagan: That's right.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:19.662
Agamemnon took off for the
Trojan War at Aulis,

00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:22.470
and you remember how the legend
goes.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.295
The winds were against the
Greeks, they wouldn't let the

00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:29.285
ships get away,
and they asked a holy man to

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:33.250
tell them what the gods were up
to and the gods said,

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.921
well you can't go until you
sacrifice your daughter,

00:14:37.921 --> 00:14:43.509
your little daughter Iphigenia
to the god for that purpose.

00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:47.801
So Agamemnon did and the winds
relented, and Agamemnon would

00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:50.929
pay the price when he got back
from Troy.

00:14:50.929 --> 00:14:55.473
But it is precisely that the
Greek fleet against the

00:14:55.473 --> 00:14:58.679
barbarian, against the
non-Greeks,

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:02.402
the most important ones in all
of their legends,

00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:06.204
namely the Trojans,
it was at all Aulis that they

00:15:06.204 --> 00:15:10.639
left and Agesilaus wanted to
bring that to the mind.

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:17.632
He was the new Agamemnon and he
was not leading a Spartan fleet

00:15:17.632 --> 00:15:23.159
against the Persians,
he was the spokesman for the

00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:27.034
Greeks.
He was the leader of the Greeks

00:15:27.034 --> 00:15:31.879
revenging that original offense,
whatever that might be.

00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:36.129
He was trying to make the case
for a panhellenic motive for

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:40.599
what was absolutely a strictly
Spartan one and raising himself

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:43.309
to a legendary level
practically.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:47.460
Well, that turned out to be a
mistake, because the Thebans

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.456
happened at that moment to be,
as far as we can tell,

00:15:51.456 --> 00:15:55.700
led by a faction that was very
hostile to the Spartans.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:16:00.271
So, as Agesilaus' people were
setting up the altars for

00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:04.803
sacrifices before they took off,
along the road came a Theban

00:16:04.803 --> 00:16:08.288
army, knocked over all of the
altars, and asked them who the

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.360
hell invited him into Boeotia in
the first place,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:16.797
to get the hell out of there,
grossly insulting Agesilaus and

00:16:16.797 --> 00:16:20.059
forcing him to skulk out of
Aulis,

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:23.649
not in the grand way that he
had imagined.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.820
This turned out to be very
significant.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:31.001
Agesilaus took it personally.
He didn't like that,

00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:37.553
and I suppose--well,
never mind I was about to make

00:16:37.553 --> 00:16:42.985
a bad joke, let it go.
It had an enormous impact

00:16:42.985 --> 00:16:47.148
on him because for the rest of
his life Agesilaus will be

00:16:47.148 --> 00:16:50.881
hostile to Thebes,
and when he could he would

00:16:50.881 --> 00:16:56.059
promote a policy of attacking
Thebes, of trying to defeat it,

00:16:56.059 --> 00:17:00.118
to subject it to Sparta,
and a whole piece of Spartan

00:17:00.118 --> 00:17:03.709
foreign policy,
which was to be very costly and

00:17:03.709 --> 00:17:08.158
damaging to Sparta was the
result of Agesilaus' attempt at

00:17:08.158 --> 00:17:10.890
vendetta against the Thebans.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:17.440
Well, he goes to Asia and
begins to encounter the

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.277
Persians.
He does pretty well,

00:17:19.277 --> 00:17:22.321
as always, Greek hoplites if
they can get the Persians to

00:17:22.321 --> 00:17:25.039
fight them in a nice flat field
will beat them,

00:17:25.039 --> 00:17:29.453
and he did that on several
occasions, but he was never able

00:17:29.453 --> 00:17:33.029
to bring a large force of
Persians to battle,

00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:37.450
so that he could really destroy
a good chunk of Persian power in

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.170
the region so that the victories
were not decisive.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.279
They could not win the war,
he could win the battles,

00:17:44.279 --> 00:17:47.329
but you couldn't win the war,
at least he didn't.

00:17:47.329 --> 00:17:52.014
Meanwhile,
things turned around against

00:17:52.014 --> 00:17:57.369
the Spartans from the side that
you might expect,

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:01.049
that is to say,
from the sea.

00:18:01.049 --> 00:18:05.652
Conon, with the Persian fleet,
sailed against the very

00:18:05.652 --> 00:18:10.950
important Island of Rhodes and
captured it and brought it back

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.380
to--took it away from the
Spartans in any case.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.628
Where the Spartans went,
you will remember,

00:18:17.628 --> 00:18:19.769
they establish oligarchic
governments,

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:24.831
and in this case the victorious
Athenian admiral removed the

00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:30.579
oligarchic government and in its
place there rose up a democracy.

00:18:30.579 --> 00:18:33.783
I'm sure the great king didn't
care what kind of regime it was

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:36.041
for the moment,
he just wanted to get rid of

00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:37.670
the Spartans,
which he did.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.529
But it was, of course,
on the Greek scene,

00:18:40.529 --> 00:18:44.714
it was a great defeat for the
Spartans and it was a challenge

00:18:44.714 --> 00:18:47.707
to the Spartans.
It was obvious that Conon,

00:18:47.707 --> 00:18:51.026
at least, and who knew what
might happen on the part of

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:53.984
other Greeks,
were going to resist Spartan

00:18:53.984 --> 00:18:56.240
power and Spartan
aggressiveness,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.920
and that if he wanted to come
back,

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.180
then he would have to have a
navy.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.554
The Spartans set out to
increase their navy to meet this

00:19:05.554 --> 00:19:09.039
challenge and just to look ahead
a few years,

00:19:09.039 --> 00:19:14.833
as I think we need to at this
moment, it was that Spartan

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:20.627
fleet that Conon defeated
thoroughly and decisively a few

00:19:20.627 --> 00:19:25.490
years later in 394 at the Battle
of Cnidus,

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:31.261
which really puts an end for
considerable time the whole idea

00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:34.819
of Sparta fighting at sea
entirely.

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:38.797
It really means that that
approach--remember we were

00:19:38.797 --> 00:19:43.164
talking last time about the
three different possibilities

00:19:43.164 --> 00:19:46.440
that the Spartans had to choose
among,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.651
and they chose for a while this
thoroughly aggressive one

00:19:49.651 --> 00:19:52.549
overseas, that's out now.
If you had been defeated at

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:55.549
sea, you don't have a navy that
can challenge your opponents,

00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:58.904
you can't do it.
As a matter of fact it will not

00:19:58.904 --> 00:20:03.171
be very much longer when events
in Greece compel them to

00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:07.283
withdraw their army under
Agesilaus and bring him back

00:20:07.283 --> 00:20:11.859
home and no Spartan army ever
goes back to Asia again.

00:20:11.859 --> 00:20:16.633
We're looking ahead but the
action that caused that was the

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:18.280
victory at Cnidus.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:24.143
Now, of course,
with the Spartans being

00:20:24.143 --> 00:20:27.827
defeated in that part of the
world, the Greek cities that

00:20:27.827 --> 00:20:31.709
have been under Spartan rule now
typically rebel against the

00:20:31.709 --> 00:20:35.415
Spartan rule,
and we must imagine that for a

00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:40.491
few years there are really quite
confused conditions in Asiatic

00:20:40.491 --> 00:20:43.659
Greece.
Some places may have continued

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:47.887
to be under Spartan rule,
some may have continued to be

00:20:47.887 --> 00:20:50.942
under Persian rule,
no doubt about it,

00:20:50.942 --> 00:20:54.839
some of them became autonomous.
We just don't know what the

00:20:54.839 --> 00:20:58.013
numbers were and there could
have been mixtures of things

00:20:58.013 --> 00:21:01.462
going on too.
I make that point because when,

00:21:01.462 --> 00:21:05.400
later on, a final settlement is
produced there,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:10.829
it is imposed upon a condition
of confusion rather than simply

00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:16.259
overthrowing a single thing that
was characteristic across the

00:21:16.259 --> 00:21:20.263
board.
Still, many of those towns as I

00:21:20.263 --> 00:21:24.279
say did return to Persian rule
as well.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:29.260
That's the situation which
leads us to the next great event

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.609
in Hellenic history across the
board.

00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:36.432
The Corinthian War,
as it is called,

00:21:36.432 --> 00:21:41.430
which breaks out in 395 and
runs down to 387-386,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:46.383
so called because the bulk of
the fighting on land was around

00:21:46.383 --> 00:21:51.720
the city of Corinth.
But it was a war that engaged

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:58.760
all of the major cities of
Greece right around its core and

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:03.511
its center.
I think a fair way to see it is

00:22:03.511 --> 00:22:09.220
the cause of that war was,
in its most fundamental sense,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.451
Sparta's tyrannical behavior
towards the other Greek cities

00:22:14.451 --> 00:22:18.059
which produces a variety of
reactions.

00:22:18.059 --> 00:22:21.953
Let me remind you of some and
tell you about some others that

00:22:21.953 --> 00:22:25.459
we haven't talked about.
Remember there were these

00:22:25.459 --> 00:22:29.898
grievances that lingered from
the end of the Peloponnesian War

00:22:29.898 --> 00:22:33.973
when Spartan allies like Corinth
and Thebes had been very

00:22:33.973 --> 00:22:38.339
dissatisfied with the way the
booty had been shared that came

00:22:38.339 --> 00:22:41.250
from the defeat of the
Athenians,

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.500
and you remember those two
cities were aggrieved also

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.125
because the Spartans ignored
their wishes as to what should

00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:51.500
happen to Athens and went their
own way there too.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.846
I think I mentioned as well
that in all contacts with

00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:58.877
non-Spartans in this period,
the Spartans seemed to be very

00:22:58.877 --> 00:23:03.652
arrogant, very hard to get along
with, and they certainly inspire

00:23:03.652 --> 00:23:06.860
considerable unhappiness and
discontent.

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.543
Those things you know about.
Now in 402, the Spartans

00:23:11.543 --> 00:23:16.847
launched a war against the
polis of Elis located up

00:23:16.847 --> 00:23:21.500
in the northwestern corner of
the Peloponnesus.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:27.150
Olympia is included in that
area, just to help you fix it in

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.156
your mind.
Now, the Spartans called upon

00:23:31.156 --> 00:23:35.491
their allies to join them in
this expedition,

00:23:35.491 --> 00:23:39.042
as is their right,
according to the traditional

00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:41.529
rules of the game in the
Peloponnesian League.

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:46.849
Thebes and Corinth refuse to
send their contingents.

00:23:46.849 --> 00:23:54.329
That is practically an act of
rebellion against the Spartans.

00:23:54.329 --> 00:23:58.714
It's a violation of their
treaty agreements and it shows

00:23:58.714 --> 00:24:02.940
you how much irritation there
existed between them.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:06.500
The whole campaign seemed to
these states very annoying

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.599
because why were the Spartans
attacking Elis,

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:12.674
partly because they had a
continuing debate,

00:24:12.674 --> 00:24:15.750
a conflict with them about a
border town,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.307
the old stuff.
But also I think as an act

00:24:19.307 --> 00:24:23.420
of revenge, because the Elians
had been disloyal during the

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.971
Peloponnesian War,
during the Peace of Nicias

00:24:26.971 --> 00:24:31.887
after 421, Aulis was one of the
four democracies that joined up

00:24:31.887 --> 00:24:36.724
in this new separate league that
ended up fighting against the

00:24:36.724 --> 00:24:41.034
Spartans for a period of time.
At the great Battle of

00:24:41.034 --> 00:24:44.732
Mantinea, in which the very
existence of Sparta was at

00:24:44.732 --> 00:24:48.640
issue, Elis was on the side of
the enemies of Sparta.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.066
So, that was why the Spartans
suddenly decided to attack them

00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:55.493
and the allies didn't think that
was right, the ones who were

00:24:55.493 --> 00:24:58.906
discontented in any case.
So, that's in the

00:24:58.906 --> 00:25:03.422
background, and all these other
irritations that I have

00:25:03.422 --> 00:25:06.468
mentioned,
but it wasn't enough because

00:25:06.468 --> 00:25:10.524
even if you were as mad as you
could be at the Spartans and

00:25:10.524 --> 00:25:14.580
determined to try to undo their
effort at hegemony over the

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:18.238
Greeks,
there was no easy way to think

00:25:18.238 --> 00:25:23.511
of fighting them successfully.
All of these states that were

00:25:23.511 --> 00:25:27.663
discontented Thebes,
Corinth, and as we will quickly

00:25:27.663 --> 00:25:32.059
see, Athens as well,
were isolated from each other.

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:36.567
They didn't belong to any
common activity and they all

00:25:36.567 --> 00:25:39.628
were not strong enough,
individually,

00:25:39.628 --> 00:25:44.058
to take on the Spartans.
Moreover, there was the problem

00:25:44.058 --> 00:25:47.958
if you wanted to fight these
people, it would require money,

00:25:47.958 --> 00:25:51.660
and all of them were short of
funds for that purpose.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.563
So the critical element
necessary to create a coalition

00:25:56.563 --> 00:26:01.556
that could undertake a war
against Sparta--that decision

00:26:01.556 --> 00:26:05.782
was made by the Persians.
The King of Persia

00:26:05.782 --> 00:26:09.475
presumably, although it very
much looks like the new

00:26:09.475 --> 00:26:12.589
satrap in that
region--there were two

00:26:12.589 --> 00:26:16.571
satraps in the western
part of the Persian Empire

00:26:16.571 --> 00:26:19.580
remember;
the one whose capital is at

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.457
Sardis in Lydia,
and the one whose capital,

00:26:22.457 --> 00:26:26.569
or whose territory is along the
Hellespont and the straits in

00:26:26.569 --> 00:26:28.396
general,
Pharnabazus,

00:26:28.396 --> 00:26:32.531
our old friend Pharnabazus from
the Peloponnesian War,

00:26:32.531 --> 00:26:38.146
and a new sIatrap in Sardis,
both want this to happen and so

00:26:38.146 --> 00:26:44.126
they find a Rhodian Greek and
give him a batch of money and

00:26:44.126 --> 00:26:49.796
send him to the Greek cities
seeking out those factional

00:26:49.796 --> 00:26:55.776
leaders who were known to be
hostile to Sparta and offering

00:26:55.776 --> 00:27:01.859
to give them some of the money
that he was carrying,

00:27:01.859 --> 00:27:05.167
which was not in itself a vast
amount and certainly not enough

00:27:05.167 --> 00:27:08.392
to fight in any war,
but was obviously a sign of

00:27:08.392 --> 00:27:12.984
good faith saying the King of
Persia and his satraps in

00:27:12.984 --> 00:27:17.350
this region are against the
Spartans and would like for you

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:22.092
to put an end to the things you
don't like that are happening in

00:27:22.092 --> 00:27:26.759
the Greek world and he will
support you with his money.

00:27:26.759 --> 00:27:29.683
That, I think,
turned out to be an absolutely

00:27:29.683 --> 00:27:32.775
critical act.
He went to a town I have

00:27:32.775 --> 00:27:37.264
not mentioned that belongs in
the company of the anti-Spartan

00:27:37.264 --> 00:27:40.134
people at this point,
of course is Argos,

00:27:40.134 --> 00:27:43.585
the traditional enemy of Sparta
running back at least into the

00:27:43.585 --> 00:27:46.299
eighth century and perhaps
further than that,

00:27:46.299 --> 00:27:51.358
who seem to find themselves in
a war with the Spartans at least

00:27:51.358 --> 00:27:56.416
once a century and it looks like
this is the time in the fourth

00:27:56.416 --> 00:27:59.546
century for them.
Argos is a democracy too,

00:27:59.546 --> 00:28:01.869
and as you know that is a
relevant fact.

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:06.451
Corinth is not a democracy,
but they are so angry they want

00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:09.932
to play too and they join up.
Thebes, again,

00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:13.029
it's hard to tell what the
government is.

00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:16.595
It looks throughout this entire
period as oligarchy and

00:28:16.595 --> 00:28:20.359
democracy may well have been
very close to one another,

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:24.017
so that at any time one faction
or the other may have the upper

00:28:24.017 --> 00:28:25.612
hand.
And, of course,

00:28:25.612 --> 00:28:28.450
Athens, which is a democracy
again.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:32.041
Now, the Athenians have been
very, very reluctant to do

00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:35.700
anything to annoy the Spartans
for very good reasons.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.530
They have no navy,
they have no walls,

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:42.891
and they have no money so to
buck the Spartans would be an

00:28:42.891 --> 00:28:46.384
act almost of suicide,
because all the Spartans needed

00:28:46.384 --> 00:28:49.490
to do was coming marching into
Attica and they have no defense.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.761
Up to now therefore they've
been very, very careful not to

00:28:52.761 --> 00:28:55.715
annoy.
In fact in 402 when the Thebans

00:28:55.715 --> 00:29:00.359
and Corinthians refused to go to
Elis with the Spartans,

00:29:00.359 --> 00:29:04.571
the Athenians sent their force,
as they were required to do by

00:29:04.571 --> 00:29:09.060
their treaty with the Spartans.
But the new situation changed

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:13.711
things in Athens just as it did,
perhaps even more than it did

00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:16.877
in other cities.
Now the great king--the

00:29:16.877 --> 00:29:20.909
Persians were not the enemy,
the Persians were going to

00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:24.418
support the war,
if they were ready to launch it

00:29:24.418 --> 00:29:27.790
against the Spartans.
There was no war yet I should

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:30.109
point out when this money is
being handed out.

00:29:30.109 --> 00:29:34.039
This is an effort to stir up
that kind of activity.

00:29:34.039 --> 00:29:39.394
Of course, the enemies of the
policy refer to these transfers

00:29:39.394 --> 00:29:44.569
of money as bribes and there's
nothing in Greek practice or

00:29:44.569 --> 00:29:49.924
Greek tradition to reject the
idea that some of these Persian

00:29:49.924 --> 00:29:56.259
coins ended up in the pockets of
the men that they were given to,

00:29:56.259 --> 00:30:00.000
but I don't think we really
should think of them as bribes.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.674
Most of the money was used for
the purpose for which it was

00:30:04.674 --> 00:30:09.188
intended, to help these leaders
stir up support for a war

00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:12.831
against Sparta.
It was something they believed

00:30:12.831 --> 00:30:17.126
in anyway, it was a source of
their ability to carry out their

00:30:17.126 --> 00:30:18.588
wishes.
But as I say,

00:30:18.588 --> 00:30:22.091
the Greeks didn't think there
was anything wrong with picking

00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:27.756
up a few bucks along the way.
Now, a war breaks out on the

00:30:27.756 --> 00:30:35.214
frontier between Phocis and
Locris, two towns in central

00:30:35.214 --> 00:30:39.661
Greece,
both of which are quite close

00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:44.140
to Boeotia, the land ruled by
the Thebes.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.385
The Spartans,
and I think this was

00:30:47.385 --> 00:30:51.615
probably--well,
I'm pretty confident that it

00:30:51.615 --> 00:30:56.631
was what--motivated by the
Spartan unhappiness about

00:30:56.631 --> 00:31:00.672
Thebes,
the Spartans assist Phocis

00:31:00.672 --> 00:31:05.348
against Locris,
knowing that Thebes is allied

00:31:05.348 --> 00:31:08.539
to Locris,
and that this would be,

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:12.000
they believed and hoped,
a pretext for war.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.459
This was their chance to get
even with the Thebans for all

00:31:15.459 --> 00:31:19.161
the things that the Thebans had
done that irritated them since

00:31:19.161 --> 00:31:23.259
the war.
So, Sparta invaded Boeotia;

00:31:23.259 --> 00:31:26.599
their strategy to win this war
was that they would invade

00:31:26.599 --> 00:31:29.966
Boeotia from two sides.
One army coming from central

00:31:29.966 --> 00:31:32.915
Greece, from the region of
Phocis and Locris,

00:31:32.915 --> 00:31:35.730
where they were assisting the
Phocians,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:41.140
and another army being sent up
from the Peloponnesus itself;

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:46.979
they do finally meet in 395 at
a town in western Boeotia called

00:31:46.979 --> 00:31:50.369
Haliartus where there is a
battle,

00:31:50.369 --> 00:31:55.342
and where by the way,
Lysander is killed in the

00:31:55.342 --> 00:31:59.450
fighting and removed from the
scene.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:03.128
But even before that
happened, as it was clear that

00:32:03.128 --> 00:32:05.990
the Spartans meant to fight the
Thebans,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:10.486
the Thebans went to Athens and
asked the Athenians for help and

00:32:10.486 --> 00:32:14.329
of course they had a case that
was very attractive.

00:32:14.329 --> 00:32:17.396
First of all,
they certainly reminded the

00:32:17.396 --> 00:32:22.148
Athenians of the roll Thebes had
played in liberating Athens by

00:32:22.148 --> 00:32:26.747
giving a home to Thrasybulus and
his free Athenians when they

00:32:26.747 --> 00:32:30.963
were in the position of
defeating the Thirty Tyrants and

00:32:30.963 --> 00:32:34.510
driving them out.
I have a feeling they didn't

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.063
remind the Athenians about that
little congress they had after

00:32:38.063 --> 00:32:41.325
the war in which they suggested
that they destroy all the

00:32:41.325 --> 00:32:44.703
Athenians and take away their
land and turn the whole place

00:32:44.703 --> 00:32:48.262
into a great big cattle farm.
I think they probably didn't

00:32:48.262 --> 00:32:51.098
remember to mention that.
But they had that reason,

00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:54.470
but more important than that,
was what they were saying,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.193
you have a chance now to escape
from your bondage to the

00:32:58.193 --> 00:33:01.579
Spartans, where the Athenians
certainly were and to

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:05.371
re-establish yourself as an
autonomous polis along

00:33:05.371 --> 00:33:09.568
with us and all the others who
want to take away power from the

00:33:09.568 --> 00:33:12.584
Spartans,
which they are abusing so

00:33:12.584 --> 00:33:16.205
terribly.
Now, the remarkable thing

00:33:16.205 --> 00:33:21.064
to me is that Xenophon,
who very likely was there,

00:33:21.064 --> 00:33:26.419
reports that the Athenian
assembly voted unanimously in

00:33:26.419 --> 00:33:29.888
favor.
Well, it's worth pointing out,

00:33:29.888 --> 00:33:34.250
of course, that the number one
advocate of doing that,

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.759
of joining the rebellion
against Sparta,

00:33:37.759 --> 00:33:43.250
was Thrasybulus the great hero
of the time that certainly made

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:47.373
a big difference.
Thrasybulus had been one of the

00:33:47.373 --> 00:33:51.337
cautious leaders before who had
been against getting the

00:33:51.337 --> 00:33:54.550
Spartans mad,
because he knew Athens was

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:59.147
incompetent to fight them now,
but with the Persian support

00:33:59.147 --> 00:34:04.140
and with the prospect of forming
a coalition against Sparta,

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:07.270
the strategic situation had
changed and Thrasybulus now came

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:09.179
out a hundred percent for the
war.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:13.388
But unanimous vote in favor of
the war, I can't imagine the

00:34:13.388 --> 00:34:17.015
Athenian assembly giving
unanimous vote in favor of

00:34:17.015 --> 00:34:21.610
getting a drink of water.
It's just so incredible to me.

00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:26.199
So, how do I explain it?
Well, I got to make it up.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.426
I think if there was an
overwhelming sentiment in favor

00:34:29.426 --> 00:34:33.072
obviously the attractions were
great but there were reasons to

00:34:33.072 --> 00:34:35.327
fear.
If you lose the price could be

00:34:35.327 --> 00:34:38.593
very, very high.
But I think what happened was

00:34:38.593 --> 00:34:43.339
that the emotion was so strong
at the moment that once it was

00:34:43.339 --> 00:34:48.559
evident that there was a large
majority in favor of the motion,

00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:53.090
nobody wanted to be seen as
being against it.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.429
It would had the look of
cowardice, of a lack of

00:34:56.429 --> 00:34:59.840
patriotism, and people in these
circumstances,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:04.046
it has been my experience,
hate to seem not to be going

00:35:04.046 --> 00:35:07.942
along when everybody is
enthusiastically going in a

00:35:07.942 --> 00:35:12.253
particular direction.
So that's how I interpret

00:35:12.253 --> 00:35:18.210
Xenophon's remarkable testimony,
but whatever the truth of it,

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:21.835
what is clear is the great
enthusiasm, overwhelming

00:35:21.835 --> 00:35:26.329
majority, they are prepared to
fight for their true autonomy in

00:35:26.329 --> 00:35:27.780
the war to come.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:33.170
So, the coalition is
finally formed.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.789
Athens, Thebes,
Corinth, Argos,

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:38.030
those are the main states on
the mainland and they'll do most

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.015
of the fighting,
but it's worth pointing out

00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:44.050
that there are other places that
join too.

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:49.449
Euboea, the island to the east
of Attica, not surprising;

00:35:49.449 --> 00:35:52.489
they're so thoroughly
influenced by the Athenians.

00:35:52.489 --> 00:35:55.661
That's not a great surprise but
it's interesting that many a

00:35:55.661 --> 00:35:57.650
town up in the north of the
Aegean,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:03.634
on the Chalcidice also joined
in this anti-Spartan coalition,

00:36:03.634 --> 00:36:07.523
and likewise,
the region in the west on the

00:36:07.523 --> 00:36:12.146
Ionian Sea of Acarnania also
join, which I think suggests

00:36:12.146 --> 00:36:16.933
that there was quite a lot of
anti-Spartan sentiment in the

00:36:16.933 --> 00:36:24.836
Greek world at this time,
which very often comes about if

00:36:24.836 --> 00:36:33.239
any state seems to be too
strong, too powerful,

00:36:33.239 --> 00:36:36.462
too much of a threat to what
everybody else wants,

00:36:36.462 --> 00:36:41.244
people tend to cut it down.
Political scientists tend

00:36:41.244 --> 00:36:46.796
to formulize this into the
notion of--if you join up with

00:36:46.796 --> 00:36:52.150
the most powerful state that's
called bandwagoning,

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:56.292
what do they call it if you're
against the--balancing,

00:36:56.292 --> 00:36:59.172
that's the word.
Sorry, I am weak in my

00:36:59.172 --> 00:37:03.373
political science technology.
Balancing is what's supposed to

00:37:03.373 --> 00:37:05.307
happen;
the truth of the matter is that

00:37:05.307 --> 00:37:07.558
you never can tell which way
states will go in these

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:10.291
situations and there you are.
But in this case I'm simply

00:37:10.291 --> 00:37:13.375
making the point that there was
a lot of hostility to Sparta out

00:37:13.375 --> 00:37:15.920
there and some people you
wouldn't think of joined in

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.187
this,
but it's the big four that

00:37:18.187 --> 00:37:22.219
really matter and they do most
of the fighting in the war.

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:26.860
Well, there's no point in going
through the war in great detail;

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.400
just a few highlights,
I think, need to be mentioned.

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.373
The largest highlight of all
being how in the world are you

00:37:34.373 --> 00:37:38.003
supposed to win this war,
what is the strategy on each

00:37:38.003 --> 00:37:41.035
side?
It's remarkable how similar

00:37:41.035 --> 00:37:44.479
they are.
The Spartans want to gain

00:37:44.479 --> 00:37:49.489
control of the isthmus of
Corinth, it's Corinth and Megara

00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:53.110
especially,
so that they can get out into

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:57.725
central Greece and defeat their
opponents individually in

00:37:57.725 --> 00:38:02.258
Boeotia for the Thebans and
Attica for the Athenians and

00:38:02.258 --> 00:38:05.260
Corinth,
of course, right there in the

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.298
isthmus.
The other folks,

00:38:07.298 --> 00:38:10.355
the big four,
want to push into the

00:38:10.355 --> 00:38:15.660
Peloponnesus where they can
raise up rebellion of the helots

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:20.964
and the perioikoi and
defeat the Spartans right there

00:38:20.964 --> 00:38:25.909
and strip away their allies in
the Peloponnesus.

00:38:25.909 --> 00:38:31.006
So, each side basically has to
gain control of the isthmus and

00:38:31.006 --> 00:38:35.853
then move forward to carry out
the conclusion of the war in

00:38:35.853 --> 00:38:39.929
their favor,
and the bottom line is neither

00:38:39.929 --> 00:38:44.559
side is able to do it.
The bulk of the fighting

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:51.199
throughout the years of that war
surround the city of Corinth,

00:38:51.199 --> 00:38:54.597
walls are put up by the
Corinthians meant to keep the

00:38:54.597 --> 00:38:57.472
Spartans out,
they do so for a great chunk of

00:38:57.472 --> 00:38:59.711
time,
Spartans can take part of the

00:38:59.711 --> 00:39:03.013
walls but they can't manage to
take everything and to punch

00:39:03.013 --> 00:39:05.000
through,
and so for all these years

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.046
that's what happens.
There are some big battles

00:39:08.046 --> 00:39:10.755
that are fought.
There's one in 394,

00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:14.472
soon after the beginning of the
war at Nemea,

00:39:14.472 --> 00:39:18.190
which is located to the south
of Corinth.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:22.435
It's a very big tough standard
hoplite battle,

00:39:22.435 --> 00:39:27.718
both sides having strong
armies, both sides fighting well

00:39:27.718 --> 00:39:30.979
and determinedly.
The Spartans technically

00:39:30.979 --> 00:39:34.071
winning--it's one of those
victories where you know who won

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:37.217
because they put up the trophy
and they were able to collect

00:39:37.217 --> 00:39:39.630
their dead,
and the other guys had to ask

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.460
permission to collect their
debt.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.779
But it was another one of these
victories that did not have

00:39:44.779 --> 00:39:48.054
strategic consequences,
neither side had been able to

00:39:48.054 --> 00:39:51.107
destroy the other,
neither side could now advance

00:39:51.107 --> 00:39:54.732
into the region that they had to
get to in order to make a

00:39:54.732 --> 00:39:59.920
difference,
so that I think is the major

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.306
story of that war.
There's another event in there

00:40:05.306 --> 00:40:09.482
that has interesting
consequences for future Greek

00:40:09.482 --> 00:40:12.550
warfare that deserves
mentioning.

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:16.856
At a certain point in that
war the Athenians,

00:40:16.856 --> 00:40:22.150
under an extraordinary general
by the name of Iphicrates,

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:27.466
had put together a force of
light-armed troops,

00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:32.204
not hoplites,
people without hoplite armor

00:40:32.204 --> 00:40:38.329
and shields who threw missiles
at the other side,

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:42.536
probably mainly slingers,
but they also would have been

00:40:42.536 --> 00:40:45.730
spear throwers,
throwers not thrusters,

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:50.267
and bowmen, and these guys
could never confront the phalanx

00:40:50.267 --> 00:40:55.196
in the normal way and they would
normally not even be able to do

00:40:55.196 --> 00:40:58.170
much harm in an extraordinary
way,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:04.257
but what was new was that
Iphicrates had trained them as a

00:41:04.257 --> 00:41:09.195
professional force,
so that they could move swiftly

00:41:09.195 --> 00:41:14.672
and together as a body in such a
way as to be as effective as it

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:20.150
was possible for light-armed
troops to be against a phalanx.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:25.760
It happened that Iphicrates was
able to maneuver a whole

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.983
division of Spartan soldiers in
such a way that they got stuck

00:41:31.983 --> 00:41:36.169
in a dead end,
in a cal du sac,

00:41:36.169 --> 00:41:42.503
and were absolutely victimized
by Iphicrates light-armed forces

00:41:42.503 --> 00:41:48.633
and about 600 men making up this
division of the Spartan army

00:41:48.633 --> 00:41:53.833
called a mora,
were wiped out and the Greek

00:41:53.833 --> 00:41:59.193
world was astonished by this,
because no such thing had ever

00:41:59.193 --> 00:42:04.119
happened before,
and it led to the increased use

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:08.971
of well trained,
light-armed infantry who play a

00:42:08.971 --> 00:42:12.283
larger role.
They never replace the

00:42:12.283 --> 00:42:16.217
phalanx as the major form of
land warfare but things become

00:42:16.217 --> 00:42:20.151
more complicated in the fourth
century as they have already

00:42:20.151 --> 00:42:23.000
begun to be in the Peloponnesian
War,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.656
as you have different branches
that are able to perform more

00:42:26.656 --> 00:42:30.002
usefully than they were
typically expected to do in the

00:42:30.002 --> 00:42:30.560
past.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.572
Perhaps as big an event as any
that occurred in that war was

00:42:41.572 --> 00:42:50.422
the event I mentioned earlier.
Conon, using the Persian fleet,

00:42:50.422 --> 00:43:02.930
defeating the Spartan fleet at
the Battle of Cnidus in 394.

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.775
But what does he do?
Conon takes his victorious

00:43:06.775 --> 00:43:11.022
fleet, sails back to Athens,
the Athenians have already

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:14.719
begun the process of rebuilding
their walls,

00:43:14.719 --> 00:43:18.455
but now with the help of
Conon's men and the money that

00:43:18.455 --> 00:43:22.671
he carries and gives to them,
they are building those walls

00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:27.028
at a much faster clip and before
the war is over the Athenians

00:43:27.028 --> 00:43:29.599
will once again be a walled
city,

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:32.820
with a walled port,
and with long walls connecting

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.409
them.
In other words,

00:43:34.409 --> 00:43:38.549
the basis for having an
independent naval policy will be

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:41.409
in place thanks to Conon's
victory.

00:43:41.409 --> 00:43:44.572
On top of which,
he takes the Persian fleet and

00:43:44.572 --> 00:43:48.431
goes to the Athenians and says,
this is now your fleet and

00:43:48.431 --> 00:43:52.451
suddenly the Athenians have
again probably the biggest fleet

00:43:52.451 --> 00:43:55.579
in the Greek world,
just like that.

00:43:55.579 --> 00:43:59.003
Similarly, or rather as a
consequence of all this,

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:02.985
because for a while at least
they are able to dominate the

00:44:02.985 --> 00:44:07.247
Aegean Sea with these forces and
with Conon around they regain

00:44:07.247 --> 00:44:11.090
those famous islands that are so
crucial to them,

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:15.491
the stepping stones to the
Hellespont: Lemnos,

00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:19.989
Imbros, Skyros--become Athenian
owned again.

00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:24.355
They also gain control of the
scared Island of Apollo at

00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:28.042
Delos.
They also make an alliance with

00:44:28.042 --> 00:44:33.852
the important Island of Chios
and suddenly you have what are

00:44:33.852 --> 00:44:38.874
the bare beginnings of the
reconstruction of the old

00:44:38.874 --> 00:44:43.697
Athenian naval alliance;
you might want to call it an

00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:46.415
empire.
Let me make it very clear that

00:44:46.415 --> 00:44:50.440
even when they become far more
powerful in years to come,

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.679
they are never able to recreate
the old Athenian Empire.

00:44:54.679 --> 00:44:59.821
They never reach the point
which was so decisive for their

00:44:59.821 --> 00:45:04.962
power where it is truly an
empire where almost every state

00:45:04.962 --> 00:45:08.570
in the league is contributing
money,

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:13.823
which allows the Athenians to
not only build but to sustain in

00:45:13.823 --> 00:45:18.732
peace time and war time the
biggest navy and the best navy

00:45:18.732 --> 00:45:20.900
around.
They never get there.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.332
They do become very
important as a naval power

00:45:23.332 --> 00:45:26.360
again, they are going to be a
very significant state again,

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.476
but even though they are
turning in that other direction

00:45:29.476 --> 00:45:32.058
they never get there.
But I think we need to remember

00:45:32.058 --> 00:45:34.449
that probably there's a very
good chunk of the Athenians,

00:45:34.449 --> 00:45:38.988
who regard those days as the
good old days and as the natural

00:45:38.988 --> 00:45:42.223
state of things,
and is the place to which they

00:45:42.223 --> 00:45:44.659
ought to be going towards that
empire.

00:45:44.659 --> 00:45:47.810
Certainly a lot of their
behavior in the Corinthian war

00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:51.369
and afterwards suggests that
that was a widespread opinion.

00:45:51.369 --> 00:45:55.018
There was, undoubtedly,
also hostility to that opinion

00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:59.010
as people look back on the
experience of what happened last

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:03.289
time, look at the consequences.
There were important

00:46:03.289 --> 00:46:08.335
socioeconomic political
significance of pursuing such a

00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:10.724
policy;
it meant democracy,

00:46:10.724 --> 00:46:14.704
it meant a naval democracy,
it meant the most extreme

00:46:14.704 --> 00:46:17.900
democracy,
and a lot of people's memories,

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:22.159
especially those of the rich
were of the mistakes and defeats

00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:25.070
that that democracy had brought
about.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.798
When you read Plato,
particularly about the Athenian

00:46:28.798 --> 00:46:33.567
democracy, or even Aristotle,
I think you have to remember

00:46:33.567 --> 00:46:38.616
that these people were very,
very critical of what the

00:46:38.616 --> 00:46:43.570
Athenian democracy had done in
the fifth century,

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.850
blamed the democracy for that
defeat, and then that was tied

00:46:47.850 --> 00:46:52.203
up with their political views in
general that democracy was a

00:46:52.203 --> 00:46:55.769
very bad wicked thing,
and that should help you

00:46:55.769 --> 00:47:00.250
understand this very strong bias
against democratic government on

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.140
the part of such people.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:09.362
Another special event in the
course of the Corinthian War,

00:47:09.362 --> 00:47:12.796
which would have some
consequence for Greek life later

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:15.862
on,
during that war there was a

00:47:15.862 --> 00:47:20.409
union between the cities of
Corinth and Argos.

00:47:20.409 --> 00:47:24.101
It was brought about by a
special emergency situation

00:47:24.101 --> 00:47:28.503
created by the war in which all
the fighting was around Corinth

00:47:28.503 --> 00:47:32.195
in which there was terrible
destruction of Corinthian

00:47:32.195 --> 00:47:35.303
property,
in which poverty came to be a

00:47:35.303 --> 00:47:39.110
problem with Corinth in a way
that it had never been.

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:41.500
There was a topsy-turvy
situation.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.371
It had been throughout the
whole fifth century back into

00:47:45.371 --> 00:47:48.610
the sixth century--an oligarchic
government,

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:52.246
a broad oligarchic government,
one that was widely thought to

00:47:52.246 --> 00:47:55.736
be a good government,
and that so far as we know was

00:47:55.736 --> 00:47:59.859
never touched until sometime
here in the Corinthian War when

00:47:59.859 --> 00:48:03.352
these extreme conditions
produced what looks like a

00:48:03.352 --> 00:48:06.643
democratic faction,
which seized power,

00:48:06.643 --> 00:48:11.909
which murdered the leaders of
the opposition in a brutal way.

00:48:11.909 --> 00:48:17.732
By the way, on a holy day,
it was a memorable and horrible

00:48:17.732 --> 00:48:22.527
event.
So, it was after that event had

00:48:22.527 --> 00:48:29.070
taken place that you see this
union between Argos,

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:32.607
which is a democracy,
and this democratic government

00:48:32.607 --> 00:48:36.699
in Corinth, which is under siege
for the reasons that I have

00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:39.577
suggested,
and what they do is they

00:48:39.577 --> 00:48:44.268
arrange for a new situation
where citizens of one state will

00:48:44.268 --> 00:48:47.130
be citizens of the other as
well.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:49.959
So, theoretically,
if you lived in Corinth and you

00:48:49.959 --> 00:48:53.596
wanted to go to Argos to sit in
on the Argive Assembly you could

00:48:53.596 --> 00:48:58.162
do it and vice versa.
This is something absolutely

00:48:58.162 --> 00:49:00.889
new.
The idea of anything but a

00:49:00.889 --> 00:49:04.650
polis being by itself or
being on top of other

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:08.000
poleis,
but the notion of their being a

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.284
sharing of a regime
interpoleis sharing of

00:49:11.284 --> 00:49:14.500
governmental responsibilities is
really new,

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.119
and it becomes more usual in
the course of the next century

00:49:19.119 --> 00:49:23.639
and the century after that.
This one hardly lasts at all;

00:49:23.639 --> 00:49:26.128
it's just a few years as a
consequence of the war,

00:49:26.128 --> 00:49:28.159
and it's undone at the end of
the war.

00:49:28.159 --> 00:49:32.127
But it's an indication of what
people might be thinking about

00:49:32.127 --> 00:49:35.830
and we shall see that in the
course of this century there

00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.599
will grow up federations--that's
something different,

00:49:39.599 --> 00:49:41.550
but still it's the same thing
in a way.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:45.939
A federation is a political
union that allows for the

00:49:45.939 --> 00:49:50.497
maintenance of local powers on
the part of the original

00:49:50.497 --> 00:49:54.465
members,
but also takes some powers for

00:49:54.465 --> 00:49:58.800
a central body,
which is made up of more than

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:01.472
one.
We Americans of course have

00:50:01.472 --> 00:50:04.477
some idea about that,
but there was the Arcadian

00:50:04.477 --> 00:50:07.860
League that came into being,
and the Achaean League that

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.194
came into being,
and the Aetolian League which

00:50:10.194 --> 00:50:13.268
came into being,
and as a matter of fact our

00:50:13.268 --> 00:50:16.903
founding fathers read very
carefully about these

00:50:16.903 --> 00:50:21.002
experiments in federal
government as they were writing

00:50:21.002 --> 00:50:25.019
the American Constitution,
we have hard evidence about

00:50:25.019 --> 00:50:27.879
that.
The best evidence for those

00:50:27.879 --> 00:50:33.619
confederations does not occur in
our period, it occurs later,

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:37.144
typically in the third and the
second centuries B.C.,

00:50:37.144 --> 00:50:40.940
and the accounts of them are in
the works of Polybius,

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.012
if you're ever interested.
So, Polybius was a very

00:50:45.012 --> 00:50:48.660
important figure for the
American founding fathers who

00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:52.942
wrote the Constitution.
But the first seed of this kind

00:50:52.942 --> 00:50:57.365
of interstate cooperation on a
basis that was not merely

00:50:57.365 --> 00:51:00.550
alliance,
but was co-citizenship is in

00:51:00.550 --> 00:51:05.070
the case of Corinth and Argos in
the course of this war.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:10.434
Well, as the war dragged
on, it became clearer and

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:15.900
clearer that neither side had
any way of prevailing.

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:19.768
But another thing that happened
that was to play a very

00:51:19.768 --> 00:51:23.779
important part in how the war
came to an end was that the

00:51:23.779 --> 00:51:28.148
Athenian control of the sea was
rapidly making Athens stronger

00:51:28.148 --> 00:51:31.694
and stronger,
and more like that scary thing

00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:35.917
which Athens had been to its
neighbors and its opponents in

00:51:35.917 --> 00:51:39.589
the fifth century B.C.,
such that the Persians,

00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:42.916
who after all,
had started the war by virtue

00:51:42.916 --> 00:51:47.790
of encouraging the anti-Spartan
factions to get together and had

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:51.659
been supporting it to some
degree during the war in

00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:55.280
general,
began to feel that maybe Athens

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.962
was becoming more frightening
from the Persian point of view

00:51:59.962 --> 00:52:02.917
than Sparta was.
After all, Sparta was out of

00:52:02.917 --> 00:52:05.966
the navy business now and they
were not likely to be able to

00:52:05.966 --> 00:52:08.632
get back into it,
and if you don't have a navy

00:52:08.632 --> 00:52:11.954
you really can't threaten Persia
very much, at least until

00:52:11.954 --> 00:52:15.159
Alexander came along and figured
out a way to do it.

00:52:15.159 --> 00:52:19.994
So, all of that gives the
Spartans, who really want to get

00:52:19.994 --> 00:52:23.217
out of this war,
because it isn't going

00:52:23.217 --> 00:52:26.980
anywhere,
the hope that they can bring

00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:32.204
about a peace and so the
Spartans try to make peace with

00:52:32.204 --> 00:52:36.547
the aid of Persia.
There's a Spartan political

00:52:36.547 --> 00:52:41.090
figure by the name of Antalcidas
who emerges on this scene,

00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:45.823
and we shall see in his life,
the few times we hear about him

00:52:45.823 --> 00:52:49.925
he's always engaged in
attempting to contain Sparta's

00:52:49.925 --> 00:52:52.922
ambitions,
to certainly exclude the

00:52:52.922 --> 00:52:57.260
possibility of overseas
commitments and I would argue,

00:52:57.260 --> 00:53:01.291
I think most scholars would
agree, even not to be engaged

00:53:01.291 --> 00:53:04.099
outside of the Peloponnesus very
far.

00:53:04.099 --> 00:53:08.124
He seems to represent a
traditionalist point of view,

00:53:08.124 --> 00:53:11.840
which obviously comes to the
fore as this war,

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.902
which the Spartans have started
really as part of Agesilaus'

00:53:15.902 --> 00:53:19.090
aggressive policy,
isn't working.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:22.117
The Spartans are having to
constantly fight,

00:53:22.117 --> 00:53:26.341
they are suffering casualties,
their allies are becoming more

00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:29.322
and more restive,
and look what's happened,

00:53:29.322 --> 00:53:32.206
suddenly Sparta which was
absolutely in charge of

00:53:32.206 --> 00:53:34.969
everything is practically on the
defensive.

00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:38.414
So, for all these reasons
there's opposition to the bold

00:53:38.414 --> 00:53:40.920
policy and Antalcidas represents
that.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.265
He gets the Spartan assembly or
the Spartan gerousia in

00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:49.611
efforts to support a mission to
the King of Persia in which he

00:53:49.611 --> 00:53:54.976
tries to negotiate a peace.
It doesn't work in large

00:53:54.976 --> 00:54:00.726
part, because the enemies,
that is Athens and Thebes

00:54:00.726 --> 00:54:04.368
particularly,
and perhaps the others--sorry

00:54:04.368 --> 00:54:07.475
Corinth and Argos also,
and I'll tell you why in a

00:54:07.475 --> 00:54:09.730
moment,
are not ready to do what is

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.250
necessary from the Spartan point
of view.

00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:16.852
What the Spartans really want
is to break up this coalition

00:54:16.852 --> 00:54:21.530
and all anti-Spartan coalitions.
That's really the bottom line

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:23.836
for Sparta.
There's no sense making peace,

00:54:23.836 --> 00:54:25.570
if you leave these people in
tact.

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.437
What's to stop the whole thing
from happening again in the

00:54:28.437 --> 00:54:31.159
future?
That's the bottom line and they

00:54:31.159 --> 00:54:35.259
are unable to persuade the
Greeks to make the concessions

00:54:35.259 --> 00:54:39.592
that are necessary.
So, the war continues and

00:54:39.592 --> 00:54:44.820
nothing really changes except
things get worse.

00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:50.988
This time Antalcidas again
negotiates a peace and he really

00:54:50.988 --> 00:54:55.880
negotiates it with the great
King of Persia.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:00.347
The King of Persia has
changed his mind about where the

00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:04.238
great threat comes from.
Thrasybulus in the 390s,

00:55:04.238 --> 00:55:08.881
in the latter part of the 390s,
engages in a series of naval

00:55:08.881 --> 00:55:13.524
campaigns all around the Aegean
Sea in which he recovers one

00:55:13.524 --> 00:55:18.403
city after another that used to
be under Athenian rule and once

00:55:18.403 --> 00:55:21.630
again puts it under Athenian
rule.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.719
He even once again starts
collecting money from them.

00:55:24.719 --> 00:55:28.050
He did something also that the
Athenians had done late in the

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.183
Peloponnesian War;
he establishes a customs house

00:55:31.183 --> 00:55:34.691
in the Hellespont in the
Bosporus and every ship that

00:55:34.691 --> 00:55:37.659
goes through pays a tax to the
Athenians.

00:55:37.659 --> 00:55:41.450
So, there's a real feeling in
Persia obviously that the

00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:45.099
Athenians are coming back to
rebuild their empire,

00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:48.814
and we better stop them and the
Spartans are safer from our

00:55:48.814 --> 00:55:51.760
point of view having been
chasing by events,

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:56.605
and so I think that's probably
the single most important reason

00:55:56.605 --> 00:55:59.809
why the great king comes out and
backs,

00:55:59.809 --> 00:56:04.254
and as we shall see,
insists on a peace in Greece

00:56:04.254 --> 00:56:09.625
which meets Sparta's needs and
the needs are that all these

00:56:09.625 --> 00:56:14.440
international organizations
should be broken up.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.425
Obviously,
the league of four states that

00:56:18.425 --> 00:56:23.136
have conducted the war must
stop, but on top of that,

00:56:23.136 --> 00:56:28.389
the union between Argos and
Corinth must be broken up;

00:56:28.389 --> 00:56:31.080
that's especially critical to
the Spartans.

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.883
That's right next door.
Argos would be strengthened by

00:56:34.883 --> 00:56:38.377
its association with Corinth and
if it were allowed to continue,

00:56:38.377 --> 00:56:40.540
it would be a problem in the
future.

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:43.361
So, it had to be broken up.
Thebes, of course,

00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:48.391
was a great problem for the
Spartans and they insisted that

00:56:48.391 --> 00:56:53.434
before peace was to come,
the Thebans had to give up

00:56:53.434 --> 00:56:57.861
their control of Boeotia.
They had used the war as an

00:56:57.861 --> 00:57:01.349
opportunity to reconstruct the
old Boeotian League,

00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:05.563
which left Thebes at the head
and in control of the bulk of

00:57:05.563 --> 00:57:10.429
Boeotia that was to be broken up
in order to reduce Theban power.

00:57:10.429 --> 00:57:12.924
Originally,
the Spartans had wanted the

00:57:12.924 --> 00:57:16.488
Athenians to give up the things
that they had acquired in the

00:57:16.488 --> 00:57:19.340
course of the war but they
couldn't do that.

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:23.627
Athens was still too strong in
the one field that they couldn't

00:57:23.627 --> 00:57:27.707
be challenged in easily -- their
control of the sea and so a

00:57:27.707 --> 00:57:31.579
compromise had to be made if a
peace was to be made.

00:57:31.579 --> 00:57:36.390
Athens would not join unless it
was allowed to keep Lemnos,

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:40.070
Skyros, Imbros.
So, that was permitted.

00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:45.481
So the peace came and the
critical part--Xenophon reports

00:57:45.481 --> 00:57:51.569
the exact language of a message
that King Artaxerxes sent to the

00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:57.849
Greeks that was in effect the
instrument that made the peace.

00:57:57.849 --> 00:58:02.451
Here's what it said,
"King Artaxerxes thinks it just

00:58:02.451 --> 00:58:07.232
that the cities in Asia,
and the islands of Klazomenai

00:58:07.232 --> 00:58:12.630
and Cyprus shall belong to him.
Further, that all the other

00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:15.038
Greek cities,
small and great,

00:58:15.038 --> 00:58:17.954
shall be autonomous."
Listen to that word,

00:58:17.954 --> 00:58:21.134
that's critical.
This peace is associated with

00:58:21.134 --> 00:58:25.511
the principle of autonomy,
there shall be no breach of

00:58:25.511 --> 00:58:28.427
autonomy except,
says the king,

00:58:28.427 --> 00:58:33.915
"Lemnos, Imbros and Skyros
which shall belong to Athens as

00:58:33.915 --> 00:58:38.039
in the past.
If any refuse to accept this

00:58:38.039 --> 00:58:44.068
peace, I shall make war on them,
along with those who are of the

00:58:44.068 --> 00:58:48.684
same purpose,
both by land and sea and with

00:58:48.684 --> 00:58:53.084
both ships and money."
Ancient writers and modern

00:58:53.084 --> 00:58:57.670
writers have disagreed as to
what is the name of this peace,

00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.972
some of them speak of the Peace
of Antalcidas,

00:59:00.972 --> 00:59:05.008
more of them I think speak,
and I think they're right in

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:09.840
this decision,
as the King's Peace.

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.117
This is not the product of
a negotiation and the king is

00:59:13.117 --> 00:59:15.340
very careful even though it
really is,

00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:17.812
but he's very careful to make
it clear that that's not the way

00:59:17.812 --> 00:59:20.950
he sees it.
This is a command leveled by

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:26.730
the king at the Greek states
saying, this is how you will be,

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:31.400
I say so, and if you don't like
it I will beat the hell out of

00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:34.360
you.
That's the message that comes.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:37.200
But, of course,
the reason he can say that,

00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:41.327
with as much confidence as he
does, is that his partner in the

00:59:41.327 --> 00:59:44.631
peace is Sparta.
This is a peace that will

00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:48.534
benefit Persia and benefit
Sparta at the expense of

00:59:48.534 --> 00:59:52.206
everybody else.
The Spartans take it as a

00:59:52.206 --> 00:59:56.920
license to run Greece in the way
that they see fit.

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.428
Notice nobody says that the
Spartans have to break up the

01:00:00.428 --> 01:00:04.529
Peloponnesian League,
that doesn't count as any kind

01:00:04.529 --> 01:00:09.582
of a violation of autonomy and
so that's the nature of the

01:00:09.582 --> 01:00:13.130
peace,
whether among the results are

01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:18.442
that the Asiatic Greeks are
abandoned by the Greek states

01:00:18.442 --> 01:00:22.520
once and for all,
and of course that means Sparta

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.669
mainly, until finally Alexander
will impose his rule when he

01:00:26.669 --> 01:00:30.696
conquers the Persian Empire.
The Boeotian League is

01:00:30.696 --> 01:00:35.240
dissolved, Argos and Corinth are
split, and Athens loses all that

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.074
has been gained except for those
three islands that are

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:41.670
mentioned.
Sparta regains,

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:46.772
and in a certain sense,
gets greater control of the

01:00:46.772 --> 01:00:51.962
mainland Greek situation.
It is the hegemon of

01:00:51.962 --> 01:00:56.539
Greece now as a kind of a
partner of the great king,

01:00:56.539 --> 01:00:59.173
and the great king leaves
Greece essentially to the

01:00:59.173 --> 01:01:01.070
Spartans without any
interference.

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:03.818
How did he do that?
In the same way that they did

01:01:03.818 --> 01:01:07.672
it to win the Peloponnesian War.
An enemy of the Spartans would

01:01:07.672 --> 01:01:12.537
say because they were Medizers,
they had done the work of the

01:01:12.537 --> 01:01:15.152
Persians;
they had collaborated with the

01:01:15.152 --> 01:01:18.276
Persians against the Greeks.
That's now how the Spartans saw

01:01:18.276 --> 01:01:20.393
it of course;
they would have something

01:01:20.393 --> 01:01:23.297
like--I guess there's a crack in
Plutarch somewhere,

01:01:23.297 --> 01:01:27.627
it says, we have not Medized;
it's the Persians who have

01:01:27.627 --> 01:01:33.219
Spartanized, but that's a very
kind way of looking at it.

01:01:33.219 --> 01:01:36.677
It is without question,
if you look back on it,

01:01:36.677 --> 01:01:41.113
we're talking just about 100
years after the Persian war and

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:44.119
it's a reversal of the Persian
Wars.

01:01:44.119 --> 01:01:47.341
The Greeks won the Persian
Wars and the proof of it was

01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:49.730
they chased the great king out
of Europe,

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.969
eager to stay alive and
completely unable to do anything

01:01:53.969 --> 01:01:58.825
about what the Greeks were to do
with the coastal regions of the

01:01:58.825 --> 01:02:02.889
Persian Empire.
Now the King of Persia is

01:02:02.889 --> 01:02:06.840
telling the Greeks what they
must do.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:12.736
It was widely seen as a cause
for great shame and by those

01:02:12.736 --> 01:02:18.943
people who were not friendly to
Sparta a great cause of anger

01:02:18.943 --> 01:02:23.826
against the Spartans,
who were responsible for this

01:02:23.826 --> 01:02:27.375
condition of things.
But the Spartans didn't care

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:31.549
much, because they were now in a
position to exercise the power

01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:34.039
that the dominant force in
Sparta,

01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:37.929
who is Agesilaus and his
supporters, wanted to do.

01:02:37.929 --> 01:02:48.900
So, in 385 we see the Spartans
attacking the city of Mantinea.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.927
Once again, the story is very
much like the story of Aulis in

01:02:52.927 --> 01:02:55.166
402.
This time Mantinea had been

01:02:55.166 --> 01:02:59.316
again, one of those states in
the Peloponnesus that had joined

01:02:59.316 --> 01:03:02.650
in a quadruple alliance against
Sparta in 421,

01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:07.304
the great battle that so much
threatened Spartan existence in

01:03:07.304 --> 01:03:11.260
418 had been fought on the
territory of Mantinea.

01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.719
It had a democratic history and
democratic tendencies.

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:20.585
So, with no pretext really
at all, the Spartans invaded

01:03:20.585 --> 01:03:23.690
their territory,
besieged the city,

01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:28.643
managed finally to defeat
Mantinea by diverting the waters

01:03:28.643 --> 01:03:33.597
of a river that ran through
Mantinea to the point where it

01:03:33.597 --> 01:03:38.030
undermined the walls and they
had to surrender.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:42.141
Xenophon learns an important
lesson about warfare from this

01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:46.039
event and he concludes his
account of this by saying,

01:03:46.039 --> 01:03:49.458
well, that shows you that you
should not build your city

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:52.754
around the river.
So, if any of you are planning,

01:03:52.754 --> 01:03:54.050
keep that in mind.

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:02.456
Then soon afterwards,
the Spartans turn on another

01:04:02.456 --> 01:04:06.326
city in the Peloponnesus,
the city of Phlyus,

01:04:06.326 --> 01:04:10.548
which is to the southwest of
Corinth, not a very big city but

01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:15.024
not a small tiny one either,
and what it turns out here is

01:04:15.024 --> 01:04:19.139
that the thing that the
Phylasians have done that the

01:04:19.139 --> 01:04:24.044
Spartans don't like is that they
have been a democracy for part

01:04:24.044 --> 01:04:26.970
of the time.
King Agesilaus basically

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:30.923
removes the government after
fighting a war and besieging the

01:04:30.923 --> 01:04:33.538
city.
It was not an easy task,

01:04:33.538 --> 01:04:38.237
it was expensive and time
consuming, but they do gain a

01:04:38.237 --> 01:04:43.633
victory and Agesilaus puts in a
new government made up not just

01:04:43.633 --> 01:04:47.193
of oligarchs,
which of course they were,

01:04:47.193 --> 01:04:50.949
but they were the personal
friends of Agesilaus.

01:04:50.949 --> 01:04:54.648
If you look at it,
historically it resembles the

01:04:54.648 --> 01:04:59.290
stuff that Lysander was doing at
the end of the Peloponnesian War

01:04:59.290 --> 01:05:03.859
and afterwards in placing these
decarchies of his friends

01:05:03.859 --> 01:05:07.317
in the cities,
so that they would not be only

01:05:07.317 --> 01:05:11.332
pro-Spartan but pro-Lysander,
and here Agesilaus did the same

01:05:11.332 --> 01:05:15.280
thing in Phylus and it's not the
only place that he did.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:21.171
Then enormity followed enormity
as the Spartan power was

01:05:21.171 --> 01:05:24.920
unchecked in this period of
time.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:29.561
Up in the north the city of
Olynthus, in the Chalcidic

01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:33.940
peninsula was gaining control of
that peninsula,

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:38.077
basically establishing itself
as the hegemonal power over

01:05:38.077 --> 01:05:42.560
cities in that region.
In 383, a couple of cities up

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:47.421
in that region came to Sparta
complaining of what the

01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:53.309
Olynthians were doing and urging
the Spartans to defend them and

01:05:53.309 --> 01:05:58.761
to undo these things,
using as the basis for their

01:05:58.761 --> 01:06:03.839
appeal the King's Peace.
This was a violation of their

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:06.552
autonomy;
the Spartans were to be the

01:06:06.552 --> 01:06:10.546
upholders of Greek autonomy
according to the King's Peace,

01:06:10.546 --> 01:06:13.349
and so they ought to send a
force up.

01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:19.743
The Spartans did so and in
the course of that war which

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:24.807
lasted from 382 to 379,
they defeated Olynthos,

01:06:24.807 --> 01:06:30.425
dissolved the confederacy,
and destroyed again any notion

01:06:30.425 --> 01:06:34.940
of a league other than the
Spartan League.

01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:39.827
There was an event that was
connected with that movement up

01:06:39.827 --> 01:06:43.148
towards the northeast,
up to the Chalcidice,

01:06:43.148 --> 01:06:46.240
which was the most famous,
I think--there's a small

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.590
competition for a couple of
events,

01:06:48.590 --> 01:06:51.734
but one of the most famous
anyway in this period

01:06:51.734 --> 01:06:55.949
illustrating the arrogance and
power of the Spartan hegemony,

01:06:55.949 --> 01:07:01.575
a Spartan force was sent off
ostensibly to reinforce their

01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:05.719
Spartan army up there in the
Chalcidice.

01:07:05.719 --> 01:07:08.699
It was led by a general named
Phoebidas.

01:07:08.699 --> 01:07:13.063
As he was moving north on a
route that would not have been

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:17.631
the normal route to take,
a route that took him right

01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:22.540
past the city of Thebes,
he camped out at night and on

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:28.191
his way there he was contacted
by an important official in the

01:07:28.191 --> 01:07:32.619
government of Thebes,
an oligarch, a friend of Sparta.

01:07:32.619 --> 01:07:38.276
The next day the Spartan army
seized the Acropolis of Thebes,

01:07:38.276 --> 01:07:41.670
which is called the
Cadmea.

01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:46.536
They did so on a sacred day,
a holiday was being celebrated,

01:07:46.536 --> 01:07:51.320
everybody was in the same shape
people are on a holiday.

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:56.670
Nobody was ready,
they took the city;

01:07:56.670 --> 01:08:01.153
the enemies of the dominant
party that had invited the

01:08:01.153 --> 01:08:05.551
Spartans in were put to death,
if they could not flee

01:08:05.551 --> 01:08:09.396
successfully.
The Spartans left a

01:08:09.396 --> 01:08:15.780
garrison on the Cadmea
and took control of the city and

01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:20.489
had their stooges run the city
thereafter.

01:08:20.489 --> 01:08:24.043
Now, this had not been
determined by the Spartan

01:08:24.043 --> 01:08:28.429
assembly, this was not the
consequence of a policy decision

01:08:28.429 --> 01:08:32.210
that the Spartan officials or
people had made.

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:36.216
When Phoebidas came back to
Sparta he was put on trial and

01:08:36.216 --> 01:08:40.293
there was great anger against
him and there was great anger

01:08:40.293 --> 01:08:44.229
against Sparta of course
throughout the Greek world.

01:08:44.229 --> 01:08:48.773
There was no real case for him,
but surprisingly enough,

01:08:48.773 --> 01:08:53.399
even though he was not a member
of Agesilaus' faction.

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:56.617
Agesilaus got up at the trial
and simply said,

01:08:56.617 --> 01:09:00.119
you guys are all talking about
the wrong thing.

01:09:00.119 --> 01:09:03.907
There's only one question that
should be asked about the

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:10.647
behavior of Phoebidas.
Was what he did good or bad for

01:09:10.647 --> 01:09:14.859
Sparta?
Well, it was obviously good.

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.289
Why in the world do you want to
punish him?

01:09:17.289 --> 01:09:21.529
He was not punished with any
severity;

01:09:21.529 --> 01:09:24.739
a mild fine or at least a fine
was imposed.

01:09:24.739 --> 01:09:26.720
We don't know if he ever paid
it.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.608
In any case,
the critical thing was what

01:09:29.608 --> 01:09:32.720
would Sparta do about the action
itself?

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:36.569
The fact that it had a garrison
up there on the Cadmea.

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.274
If they thought it had been the
wrong thing to do,

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:42.199
if it had been the idea that
Phoebidas and what didn't

01:09:42.199 --> 01:09:44.902
represent Spartan policy,
then they should have withdrawn

01:09:44.902 --> 01:09:46.921
the garrison.
The garrison stayed,

01:09:46.921 --> 01:09:51.334
so that Sparta now--this was
something that rang all around

01:09:51.334 --> 01:09:54.659
the Greek world.
This was the worst thing

01:09:54.659 --> 01:09:59.125
anybody could remember in peace
time with no allegation of

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:02.038
cause,
they had simply seized another

01:10:02.038 --> 01:10:04.614
city, an ancient city,
a great city,

01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:06.970
and they refused to back off.

01:10:10.159 --> 01:10:17.310
Finally there's one other
example of this same kind of

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:20.566
behavior.
The government in Thebes was

01:10:20.566 --> 01:10:23.649
tyrannical, imposed upon an
unwilling people;

01:10:23.649 --> 01:10:28.604
some of the people who had fled
did a reverse of what happened

01:10:28.604 --> 01:10:32.340
in the time of the Thirty
Tyrants in Athens.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.191
They fled to Athens,
and, of course,

01:10:35.191 --> 01:10:39.591
the Athenians gave them
support, and protected them and

01:10:39.591 --> 01:10:44.398
then in 379 a small number of
these exiles launched a clever

01:10:44.398 --> 01:10:49.286
plot that allowed them to sneak
into Thebes and to make their

01:10:49.286 --> 01:10:54.256
way to the Cadmea and to
kill the oligarchic leaders of

01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:59.307
the city in the dark when nobody
could really do anything about

01:10:59.307 --> 01:11:03.076
it,
and to drive away a number of

01:11:03.076 --> 01:11:06.149
the Spartans and to free the
city.

01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:09.612
Thebes became free,
it became democratic too,

01:11:09.612 --> 01:11:13.652
because these people now
belonged to a democratic faction

01:11:13.652 --> 01:11:16.374
and more and more,
if you're a democrat,

01:11:16.374 --> 01:11:18.643
you're anti-Spartan,
if you're an oligarch,

01:11:18.643 --> 01:11:21.749
you're a pro-Spartan,
and so all of this is the

01:11:21.749 --> 01:11:25.730
beginning of what we will get to
next time, which is the

01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:29.826
flowering of Theban power.
It's going to happen as they

01:11:29.826 --> 01:11:33.461
get stronger and stronger,
but the event I wanted to

01:11:33.461 --> 01:11:37.810
mention as the twin of the
Phoebidas thing is that in 379,

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:43.909
a Spartan harmost of the
one of the garrisons in Boeotia

01:11:43.909 --> 01:11:48.729
by the name of Sphodrias took a
force by night,

01:11:48.729 --> 01:11:52.866
marched into Attica,
ostensibly his plan was to

01:11:52.866 --> 01:11:58.531
reach the Piraeus and then that
would allow them to take control

01:11:58.531 --> 01:12:01.408
of Athens,
because they could cut them off

01:12:01.408 --> 01:12:04.729
from their port at the sea.
He didn't get it quite right.

01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:08.760
By the time morning broke and
they were visible he was still

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:11.962
miles and miles,
and miles away from the Piraeus

01:12:11.962 --> 01:12:15.590
and so all he could do was to do
some harm to the Athenian

01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:19.293
territory and then to go home.
Well, when he got home again he

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:22.345
hadn't gotten any vote from the
Spartan assembly or from the

01:12:22.345 --> 01:12:25.449
gerousia or from the
ephors to do anything,

01:12:25.449 --> 01:12:28.550
another thing that he had
apparently done on his own.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:34.306
So, there was another trial and
this time the only thing he had

01:12:34.306 --> 01:12:39.992
going for him apparently--well,
he still had Agesilaus' general

01:12:39.992 --> 01:12:44.729
approach, but he was the lover
of the son of Agesilaus,

01:12:44.729 --> 01:12:49.468
and so Agesilaus who ostensibly
was hostile to what had happened

01:12:49.468 --> 01:12:54.132
was made to speak in his defense
and this time his argument was

01:12:54.132 --> 01:12:57.211
simply,
Sparta has too few men of

01:12:57.211 --> 01:13:01.895
quality to be able to execute
any for whatever reason

01:13:01.895 --> 01:13:07.210
whatsoever and so we shouldn't
do anything to Sphodrias.

01:13:07.210 --> 01:13:11.560
So, they didn't.
That was yet another signal and

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:16.781
it had fantastic consequences.
In Athens they had been

01:13:16.781 --> 01:13:21.474
holding some Spartan ambassadors
when the Sphodrias' raid had

01:13:21.474 --> 01:13:25.385
taken place and they were
holding them in effect as

01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:27.848
hostages,
but the Spartans said,

01:13:27.848 --> 01:13:31.580
look we had nothing to do with
it, this was--Sphodrias did it

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.731
all on his own,
and he'll certainly be

01:13:33.731 --> 01:13:35.560
condemned when he gets back to
Sparta.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.399
So, the Athenians said okay,
you can go home,

01:13:38.399 --> 01:13:42.143
and then he wasn't and so the
Athenians now were determined

01:13:42.143 --> 01:13:44.789
that they would have to fight
Sparta.

01:13:44.789 --> 01:13:48.866
In the process,
they set about organizing an

01:13:48.866 --> 01:13:53.890
alliance, a general alliance,
meant against Sparta,

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.885
which they were able to do in
considerable part,

01:13:56.885 --> 01:14:00.071
because of all of the
irritation that had been felt

01:14:00.071 --> 01:14:03.194
all around Greece by these
terrible actions of the

01:14:03.194 --> 01:14:06.483
Spartans,
and as I think I'll tell you

01:14:06.483 --> 01:14:11.483
next time, they put together
what we call the Second Athenian

01:14:11.483 --> 01:14:15.672
Confederation,
and they made an alliance with

01:14:15.672 --> 01:14:20.375
the newly liberated Thebes.
Thebes, which is going to get

01:14:20.375 --> 01:14:24.241
stronger and stronger,
and stronger and so we have now

01:14:24.241 --> 01:14:28.326
a threat once again to the
Spartan hegemony which will be

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:31.330
very serious,
but of a different kind from

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:33.629
the one we had before.
I'll tell you about it next

01:14:33.629 --> 01:14:34.629
time.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.120
Prof: As you undoubtedly
have noticed,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.211
most of the course has been--I
sort of have a global focus and

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.967
mostly focused on foreign
countries with a fair amount on

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:16.120
Europe and very little actually
on America.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.526
Now we've come to the part of
the course where we're going to

00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:22.990
discuss social issues and those
are very country dependent.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.839
What's a hot social issue
depends on the cultural context

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.620
and so we're going to use that
to do American issues.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.552
With respect to reproduction,
one of the main--there are a

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:37.630
couple of main issues.
 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.941
One, which is not quite as hot
as it was a decade ago,

00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:46.850
but it's teen sex and teen
pregnancy.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.734
Both as an ethical,
moral issue and as a practical

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:56.220
economic issue about the
children of teens.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.082
How are they going to get
supported and what does it do to

00:01:00.082 --> 00:01:03.539
poverty of the mother,
and you have some really good

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.030
readings on those.
 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.226
The other one--the other topic
which will come next after this

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:10.537
is abortion;
we're going to spend two

00:01:10.537 --> 00:01:11.718
lectures on that.
 

00:01:11.718 --> 00:01:16.123
There's going to be a nice long
discussion of that because that

00:01:16.123 --> 00:01:17.970
is really the hot topic.
 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.920
Today is teen sexuality and
teen pregnancy.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.132
Just to start with some data
and keep it local,

00:01:25.132 --> 00:01:30.080
this is from The Hartford
Courant, last November

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.180
19,2008.
 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.185
There's a national youth risk
behavior survey that monitors

00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:41.120
health risk among high school
kids,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.769
9^(th) through 12^(th) graders
all over the United States.

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:51.235
In Connecticut 42.4% of the
kids have had sexual intercourse

00:01:51.235 --> 00:01:57.810
of high school kids and it says
31.8% are sexually active.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.243
I don't know exactly what
active means so I guess they're

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:00.810
continuing.
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.359
There's a few percent that
didn't like it or something,

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:10.669
but there's quite a lot of both
onetime early sexuality and than

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.030
a continuing bout of it.
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.740
As part of the problem,
of those that have had sex,

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.126
or are sexually active,
37.3% reported that they did

00:02:22.126 --> 00:02:27.286
not use any kind of protection
at the last act of intercourse

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:31.930
and therefore they're at great
risk for pregnancy.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.001
That's just real sexual
intercourse, I guess as Bill

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.090
Clinton defines it.
 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.514
When you go to oral sex you get
another set of numbers,

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:50.038
and oral sex as you may,
or may not, know has become the

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:52.550
big thing in America.
 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.389
I'm sure that--we don't really
know the causes of it,

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.720
I'm not aware of any real
academic literature on that,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.620
but the fear of AIDS there's a
perception,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.096
which is true,
that oral sex is less likely

00:03:04.096 --> 00:03:05.586
to--
not zero likely,

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:08.000
but less likely to transmit
AIDS.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.770
And also because,
maybe--I don't know how much

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.442
you're aware of this,
but during the Bill Clinton

00:03:13.442 --> 00:03:15.945
trials,
a very conservative prosecutor

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:19.000
Kenneth Star,
was talking about oral sex all

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.735
the time and everybody in
America learned about it and he

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.470
sort of popularized it.
 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.716
As is often the case,
people that want to push an

00:03:28.716 --> 00:03:32.962
idea in one direction,
end up having pushed it in

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:36.060
exactly the opposite direction.
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.810
Oral sex is alive and well in
New Haven.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.312
I sometimes teach teachers how
to talk in their classes about

00:03:46.312 --> 00:03:50.585
the kind of population issues,
the kind of issues we talk

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:54.099
about in this class,
and they give me a lot of

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.378
information.
 

00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:57.875
One day I'm talking to these
teachers and they say,

00:03:57.875 --> 00:04:00.718
'oh, something interesting has
happened in the school.'

00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:05.591
In one of the local high
schools, a freshman girl,

00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:11.854
was caught in the stairwell was
providing oral sex for a line of

00:04:11.854 --> 00:04:12.750
boys.
 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.528
They were standing there
waiting, a few of them with

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:19.862
their pants down,
and this girl was doing them

00:04:19.862 --> 00:04:21.639
one after the other.
 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.069
This is a freshman in the local
high school.

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.209
The New Haven Register
had a headline,

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:32.841
"Teens Turn To Oral
Sex," 10^(th) grade

00:04:32.841 --> 00:04:35.310
students so that's high school
sophomores,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.641
40% of the boys and girls
reported that they had engaged

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:42.581
in oral sex in the last year,
and about 25% that they had

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:47.399
three or more different oral sex
partners in the previous year,

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:53.490
so sex among teenagers is alive
and well,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.089
as they say.
 

00:04:57.089 --> 00:05:01.139
Here's your anecdote for the
day.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.127
A teenager--so Hartford,
as you know,

00:05:03.127 --> 00:05:06.276
is a very bad--there are a lot
of poor people in Hartford,

00:05:06.276 --> 00:05:07.990
let's just put it that way.
 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.545
Planned Parenthood has set up a
clinic in the northeast part of

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:16.882
Hartford, a very poor part of
Hartford, and this is from one

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:18.939
of the counselors there.
 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:22.093
A teenager, a teenage girl,
comes into the Planned

00:05:22.093 --> 00:05:24.410
Parenthood clinic there and
says,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.310
'I'm pregnant,' and the
counselor says,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.009
'oh how do you know that?'
 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.702
She says, 'I not only know
that, I know exactly when I got

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:33.480
pregnant.'
 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.519
'Oh?'
 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:38.302
'Well I know that if you
only--if your boyfriend comes

00:05:38.302 --> 00:05:41.300
only once, you can't get
pregnant."

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.569
But, on such and such a day,
and she named the date,

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.531
"we did it twice and I
allowed him to come the second

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:49.560
time and that's when I got
pregnant,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.589
I know that's when I got
pregnant."

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:55.916
Because she was of the belief
that one time can't do it,

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:57.569
but two times will.
 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.500
Well they took the test and
indeed she -- yes?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.449
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.951
Prof: Indeed she took
the test and indeed she was

00:06:05.951 --> 00:06:08.497
pregnant but she had been
pregnant like two months before

00:06:08.497 --> 00:06:09.589
she thought she was.
 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:12.540
She had it completely wrong.
 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.401
Student:  My mother
worked in the National Health

00:06:14.401 --> 00:06:16.699
Service Corps in the 1970s--
Prof: Shout.

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:19.435
Student:  My mother
worked in the National Health

00:06:19.435 --> 00:06:20.083
Service Corp.
 

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:23.069
in the 1970s in rural Colorado
and she had a 12-year-old come

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:25.605
in who was in labor and she
didn't know that she was

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:27.000
pregnant at the time.
 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.730
Prof: Did not?
 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.759
Yeah so that's--I don't know
that you heard all that;

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.543
her mother worked in Colorado
and a 12-year-old came in,

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:37.259
in labor, and she didn't even
know she was pregnant.

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.666
That's a story,
Colorado, Hartford,

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:42.470
it's all around.
 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.690
In 1999, which was sort of the
peak of this concern about

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.887
teenage pregnancy,
450 Hartford teenagers gave

00:06:51.887 --> 00:06:52.819
birth.
 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:55.610
How many completed high school?
 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:59.694
332 girls graduated from
Hartford City schools in that

00:06:59.694 --> 00:07:00.620
same year.
 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.898
So, one-third more girls became
mothers than graduated from high

00:07:04.898 --> 00:07:05.509
school.
 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:09.689
You can imagine this was
considered a serious problem.

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:12.463
Now what is this--the
social--the political,

00:07:12.463 --> 00:07:15.689
the social, the school response
to this problem?

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.699
Well they're kind of hamstrung.
 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:21.660
A nurse practitioner at a
Hartford school clinic said that

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.273
she's allowed to test and treat
students for sexually

00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:28.875
transmitted diseases,
but she can do nothing about

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:30.800
the possibility of pregnancy.
 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.197
She may not prescribe birth
control or even distribute

00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:37.190
condoms in the school.
 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.586
There was a proposal in the
city council to allow the

00:07:42.586 --> 00:07:49.230
schools to distribute condoms,
and it was roundly turned down.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.139
What is--why is--what is the
political concern here.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:59.660
The political concern is what
you can see here,

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:06.702
that people who are opposed to
providing contraception for

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:10.369
teenagers,
including politicians,

00:08:10.369 --> 00:08:15.035
this is an advocacy ad,
this is not an academic sort of

00:08:15.035 --> 00:08:15.560
thing.
 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.127
This is actually true,
that people believe that even

00:08:20.127 --> 00:08:24.069
discussing sex will tend to
encourage it,

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:29.512
and certainly handing out birth
control will facilitate

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:31.829
teenagers having sex.
 

00:08:31.829 --> 00:08:35.339
This is the political;
this is the opinion,

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:39.767
the kind of attitude that is
opposed to it and why the

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:44.529
Hartford school system and many
other school systems can't

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:46.870
provide contraception.
 

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.734
Of course this gets discussed a
lot and it's a topic of

00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:55.100
discussion not only for the
parents but for the teenagers,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.340
and one nice quote from Maritza
Lopez,

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.929
who was a Hartford public
school high school junior,

00:09:01.929 --> 00:09:03.408
and she was already a mother.
 

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:08.597
She dismissed this idea saying,
"All the girls I know are

00:09:08.597 --> 00:09:10.129
sexually active.
 

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:12.941
Most started in the 6^(th) or
7^(th) grade,

00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:16.019
they're going to do it no
matter what."

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:19.440
Now I experienced this same
kind of attitude.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.537
I was again teaching the
teachers, sort of teacher

00:09:22.537 --> 00:09:26.710
training kind of stuff and I was
new at it, a little naīve.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:29.340
This was Connecticut teachers
from all over the state.

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.153
Before I started,
I said, look,

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:34.174
we're going to discuss some
pretty heavy stuff here

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:37.557
involving sex and everything,
and I don't know how much of

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:39.360
this you can talk to your kids
about.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.500
They roared with laughter!
 

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.899
What they all told me was
"all of our kids"--

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:46.980
they exaggerated,
I'm sure it wasn't all,

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.490
but the way they expressed it
was 'all of our kids were into

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:50.129
sex already'.
 

00:09:50.129 --> 00:09:54.034
I can say anything that I want,
there's nothing that they're

00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:55.690
going to be shocked by.
 

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.149
Some schools can do a decent--a
proper sex education;

00:10:04.149 --> 00:10:07.600
some schools are not allowed to
do proper sex education.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.311
A problem, even in the schools
where it's allowed,

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:15.580
is often the choice of
teachers.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.009
It can be the Health Ed.
 

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:20.048
teacher or someone who may be a
jock, that has said,

00:10:20.048 --> 00:10:22.730
okay it's your job to teach sex
education.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.087
It's rarely that a teacher gets
to volunteer,

00:10:25.087 --> 00:10:28.089
that they survey all the
teachers and say this is a tough

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:29.590
job, who wants to do it?
 

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:31.928
No, somebody gets assigned to
do that.

00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:36.490
Then, you get the--very often,
the teacher herself may not

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.009
approve of sex education for the
children.

00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:42.936
She may think it's not a proper
topic for a school for whatever

00:10:42.936 --> 00:10:44.730
grade she's supposed to teach it
in.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:47.620
She may--and I say she,
it may be she or he,

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.269
the teacher may be
uncomfortable talking about sex,

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:55.539
may not be well-educated on how
to handle questions about sex or

00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:58.600
about contraception,
may also, very likely now,

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.313
be afraid of legal
complications or disciplinary

00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:04.950
actions from the school if they
handle it wrong and they say the

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:07.322
wrong thing,
and parents start objecting,

00:11:07.322 --> 00:11:10.485
which certainly happens,
and it happens in Connecticut

00:11:10.485 --> 00:11:13.538
and I've been involved in some
of that stuff.

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:17.917
Parents coming in and screaming
and yelling at him or

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:21.788
threatening to sue the teacher,
it--happens.

00:11:21.788 --> 00:11:25.048
In any case,
most sex education teachers,

00:11:25.048 --> 00:11:28.330
as far as one has data,
which is very skinny,

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:33.423
the teaching of this subject is
just not coming from a person's

00:11:33.423 --> 00:11:34.000
guts.
 

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.470
They're fulfilling a curriculum
assignment,

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:38.918
it's something that they are
assigned to do,

00:11:38.918 --> 00:11:41.678
and if, in something of this
nature,

00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:45.950
the teacher is not really--this
is not coming from her soul,

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:50.950
then its guarantee to be an
unsuccessful program.

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:53.750
We've seen things like this
before.

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.442
Remember when we talked about
the family planning program in

00:11:56.442 --> 00:11:57.629
Pakistan and Bangladesh.
 

00:11:57.629 --> 00:12:00.918
They started with the Daiyis
when it was one country,

00:12:00.918 --> 00:12:02.936
when it was Pakistan,
and the Daiyis were the

00:12:02.936 --> 00:12:05.548
traditional birth attendants who
themselves were not using

00:12:05.548 --> 00:12:07.322
contraception,
didn't believe in it,

00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:10.524
didn't know anything about it,
and could make more money

00:12:10.524 --> 00:12:12.350
doing--attending births.
 

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:16.489
The program was a complete
failure until they changed and

00:12:16.489 --> 00:12:19.815
started hiring women who
themselves were using

00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:22.770
contraception,
some were high status and

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.868
really approved of it,
and then the program became a

00:12:25.868 --> 00:12:26.700
great success.
 

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:28.070
You have to have consistency.
 

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:30.686
If you make a law,
or try to have a policy,

00:12:30.686 --> 00:12:34.485
the people that are supposed to
carry out the policy must want

00:12:34.485 --> 00:12:35.418
to do that.
 

00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:38.837
If they don't really want to do
that, whatever your policy is,

00:12:38.837 --> 00:12:41.639
in any area of activity,
it's not going to work.

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:50.971
Now this doesn't mean that it's
necessarily terribly difficult

00:12:50.971 --> 00:12:53.210
to be effective,
the sex education.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:55.173
Planned Parenthood,
for instance,

00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:58.490
I used them as an example
because I know about them.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.710
They do a lot of sex education
for the schools,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:03.903
and often when the school is
uncomfortable doing it or

00:13:03.903 --> 00:13:06.178
doesn't have anybody that they
think wants to do it,

00:13:06.178 --> 00:13:08.639
or is qualified to do it,
they will call in Planned

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:11.788
Parenthood or one of a number of
other kinds of organizations.

00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:14.639
Planned Parenthood has the
flexibility to hire people;

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:17.643
they don't have licensing and
so forth requirements--who are

00:13:17.643 --> 00:13:19.730
really committed to this kind of
thing.

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:23.360
They did what they call a
seminar for high school

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.769
students,
again in Connecticut here,

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:29.174
I think it was also Hartford
and they got a letter back from

00:13:29.174 --> 00:13:31.259
one of the students:
"Hello,

00:13:31.259 --> 00:13:33.830
my name is Kelly and I was in
your seminar.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.998
I would like to thank you for
making me aware of some of the

00:13:36.998 --> 00:13:38.178
consequences of sex.
 

00:13:38.178 --> 00:13:41.599
Because of your seminar I got
the courage to ask my mother for

00:13:41.599 --> 00:13:45.073
birth control before something
happened that I would regret for

00:13:45.073 --> 00:13:46.418
the rest of my life.
 

00:13:46.418 --> 00:13:49.466
I also got the courage to ask
my boyfriend to use a condom

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:50.590
instead of nothing.
 

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:54.081
Thank you so much,
you've really honestly changed

00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:54.808
my life.
 

00:13:54.808 --> 00:13:57.957
I guess when the information
doesn't come from the teacher it

00:13:57.957 --> 00:13:59.059
actually hits home.
 

00:13:59.059 --> 00:14:01.120
Thank you, Kelly."
 

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.200
Now this is a teenager's letter
and its one anecdote,

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.871
so you can't make an awful lot
out of it, but you have to think

00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:08.879
a little bit.
 

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:12.264
She says, "making me aware
of some of the consequences of

00:14:12.264 --> 00:14:12.928
sex."
 

00:14:12.928 --> 00:14:15.639
Well, do you think she really
didn't know you could get

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:18.000
pregnant from sex,
that you can get diseases?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.934
No, she knew that,
that she had misidentified what

00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:23.139
was going on.
 

00:14:23.139 --> 00:14:26.613
I doubt--I'd be flabbergasted
if she didn't know that by the

00:14:26.613 --> 00:14:28.379
time she was in high school.
 

00:14:28.379 --> 00:14:29.000
What do you think?
 

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.070
You have a more recent
experience in high school;

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.970
don't all the kids know that
you get pregnant from sex?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:38.500
Yes, and all know that you can
get a disease--an STD from sex?

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.899
Not so sure,
all right maybe Kelly

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:47.769
was--maybe I'm wrong and Kelly
was right, I don't know.

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:49.188
The thing is,
it's all in the way it's

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:49.649
presented.
 

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:51.657
If it's presented by someone
that really cares about it and

00:14:51.657 --> 00:14:54.528
wants to do it,
there's just a whole different

00:14:54.528 --> 00:14:58.798
atmosphere and kids minds open
up to this kind of thing.

00:14:58.798 --> 00:15:04.422
Anyway, America is generally in
a mess with respect to sex

00:15:04.422 --> 00:15:07.480
education and sex in general.
 

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:12.580
It's quite different than the
European countries.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:17.220
So, here is a typical graph
that is presented frequently.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.389
This shows the number of
children born to teenagers,

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:23.778
this is again at the peak of
the problem,

00:15:23.778 --> 00:15:25.618
and here's France,
here's Germany,

00:15:25.618 --> 00:15:27.389
here's Japan,
here's Great Britain,

00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:30.038
and, Whooops,
here's the United States.

00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:32.226
Student:  Is there a
graph adjusted for population

00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:32.538
sizes?
 

00:15:32.538 --> 00:15:34.639
Prof: Perfect,
that was the next question and

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:36.408
I'm glad one of you caught it
right away.

00:15:36.408 --> 00:15:40.735
This is again--usually
presented like this,

00:15:40.735 --> 00:15:43.309
it's an advocacy thing.
 

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:46.327
It wants to scare you;
it wants to show you how much

00:15:46.327 --> 00:15:49.168
worse the United States is than
everybody else.

00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:52.437
As we just got told,
the United States has a much

00:15:52.437 --> 00:15:55.570
larger population then any of
these places,

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:58.602
so this is not really a
legitimate way of presenting the

00:15:58.602 --> 00:15:58.990
data.
 

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:04.009
Of course, your dutiful teacher
redid it and here is when you

00:16:04.009 --> 00:16:09.111
divide out by population and you
see it's not as severe as the

00:16:09.111 --> 00:16:12.953
illegitimate graph,
but--the United States is still

00:16:12.953 --> 00:16:15.313
more than twice,
has more than twice the

00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:18.080
percentage problem;
anyways it's still serious.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.897
In fact, they didn't have to
use the improper data they could

00:16:23.897 --> 00:16:29.519
have used data like this and
still the problem becomes very

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:30.490
clear.
 

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:34.798
From a lot of studies of these
kinds of things,

00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:39.297
it turns out countries that
have a very liberal attitude

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:43.549
toward sexuality have the lowest
teen birthrates,

00:16:43.549 --> 00:16:47.889
teen pregnancy rates.
 

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:50.519
A place like the Netherlands,
probably in the west,

00:16:50.519 --> 00:16:53.490
either Denmark,
or Sweden, or Netherlands is

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:57.841
probably the most liberal and in
those countries it's considered

00:16:57.841 --> 00:17:01.434
a perfectly normal part of
teenage experience and the

00:17:01.434 --> 00:17:04.958
teenagers are expected and
encouraged to bring their

00:17:04.958 --> 00:17:09.380
girlfriend or boyfriend home and
sleep in the same room.

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:12.102
That may be starting to happen
in America--how many of your

00:17:12.102 --> 00:17:13.368
parents would allow that?
 

00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:19.539
A few all right we're--she's
married.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:25.351
The U.S.
 

00:17:25.351 --> 00:17:30.759
rate is 54 per 1,000 teens,
about one out of 20 each year,

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.598
and in the Netherlands the
figure is 7,

00:17:32.598 --> 00:17:37.366
so eight times lower,
and it's a huge difference

00:17:37.366 --> 00:17:41.019
depending on the country
attitude.

00:17:41.019 --> 00:17:46.278
In academical discussions,
these things get terribly mixed

00:17:46.278 --> 00:17:46.740
up.
 

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.938
There is a bunch of issues
which usually people don't

00:17:50.938 --> 00:17:52.150
separate out.
 

00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.059
One is teen pregnancy and
that's very different than

00:17:55.059 --> 00:17:58.484
teen--can be different than teen
childbearing because not all

00:17:58.484 --> 00:18:00.538
those pregnancies come to birth.
 

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.211
There's teen sex,
then you have sex,

00:18:02.211 --> 00:18:04.601
you might get pregnant,
and if you get pregnant you

00:18:04.601 --> 00:18:06.368
might actually have a live
birth.

00:18:06.368 --> 00:18:09.898
So there's three different
steps, and when you're looking

00:18:09.898 --> 00:18:12.608
at statistics you have to
separate those.

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:17.176
Another is the whole idea of
out-of-wedlock births,

00:18:17.176 --> 00:18:21.380
births born to mothers that are
not married.

00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:26.202
You can combine all
pregnancies, you combine those

00:18:26.202 --> 00:18:30.038
two, out-of-wedlock teen
pregnancies.

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:33.429
When you read discussions of
this, try to figure out what

00:18:33.429 --> 00:18:36.880
they're talking--which of these
problems they're about.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:40.452
It's often not made very clear,
but it's very important to keep

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:41.259
it straight.
 

00:18:41.259 --> 00:18:47.691
I'll try to talk about these
different things and make it

00:18:47.691 --> 00:18:48.608
clear.
 

00:18:48.608 --> 00:18:53.304
When you discuss this--one
issue is--what do the statistics

00:18:53.304 --> 00:18:57.674
you're looking at refer to,
and I hope I've always been

00:18:57.674 --> 00:18:59.779
clear in these slides.
 

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:04.711
The other, when you go across
nationally, like to other

00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:10.098
countries, and it's not always
clear what marriage means.

00:19:10.098 --> 00:19:14.746
In other cultures--in the West
in general and the United States

00:19:14.746 --> 00:19:18.211
in particular,
a marriage is a legal statement

00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:21.180
and it's an all or nothing sort
of thing.

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.676
You either have a marriage
certificate and you are married,

00:19:23.676 --> 00:19:26.002
or you don't have a marriage
certificate and you're not

00:19:26.002 --> 00:19:26.519
married.
 

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:28.560
And if you have one,
and you get divorced,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.099
then you--in terms of you don't
have one anymore.

00:19:31.099 --> 00:19:32.779
It's an on or off kind of thing.
 

00:19:32.779 --> 00:19:36.500
Everyone really knows whether
they are married or they are not

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.108
married.
 

00:19:37.108 --> 00:19:40.323
In other cultures,
marriage is quite variable,

00:19:40.323 --> 00:19:43.750
it's a stage thing,
and it may have various steps

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.180
in the marriage.
 

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:48.579
For instance,
in Nigeria among the Fulani,

00:19:48.579 --> 00:19:52.479
at circumcision,
a boy who's age seven to ten at

00:19:52.479 --> 00:19:56.710
this time, is then betrothed to
an infant girl.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.670
Sometimes betrothed is
translated as married to.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.009
When the future husband--But
they don't live together.

00:20:05.009 --> 00:20:09.604
When the future husband's
father learns from the girl's

00:20:09.604 --> 00:20:12.162
parents,
who are living separately,

00:20:12.162 --> 00:20:15.717
that she has begun menstruation
and then is believed to be

00:20:15.717 --> 00:20:18.703
capable of childbirth,
the girl then moves into her

00:20:18.703 --> 00:20:22.088
husband's--
her future husband's compound.

00:20:22.088 --> 00:20:25.328
So they're still betrothed,
she's now menstruating,

00:20:25.328 --> 00:20:27.939
so she moves in with the
husband, and it's still the

00:20:27.939 --> 00:20:31.111
future husband and she's treated
as a daughter of the husband's

00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:35.192
father's household,
she's treated like a sister of

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.048
the boy.
 

00:20:36.048 --> 00:20:39.914
The boy and girl sleep
together, they have sex in the

00:20:39.914 --> 00:20:42.038
open,
and the boy is usually in this

00:20:42.038 --> 00:20:44.303
culture,
it's a herding culture,

00:20:44.303 --> 00:20:48.345
they sleep outside near the
corral to guard the cattle

00:20:48.345 --> 00:20:52.538
against raiders and wolves and
whatever kind of predator

00:20:52.538 --> 00:20:54.750
animals they have there.
 

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.490
That's all done,
of course, very openly.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.807
They still have the status of
an unmarried youth and a maiden,

00:21:01.807 --> 00:21:05.700
where she is not a virgin
anymore but she's a maiden.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:10.161
When the girl becomes pregnant,
she moves back to her father's

00:21:10.161 --> 00:21:14.476
household and she stays there
for three wet seasons and they

00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:17.619
have wet and dry seasons there,
so it's a

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:21.191
geological--climatological thing
and that takes two to two and a

00:21:21.191 --> 00:21:23.970
half years depending on when
they've started,

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.952
and then she returns to the boy
and only then are they

00:21:27.952 --> 00:21:29.528
considered married.
 

00:21:29.528 --> 00:21:32.233
There are so many different
steps and then they are

00:21:32.233 --> 00:21:33.369
officially married.
 

00:21:36.288 --> 00:21:39.900
Using our definition of
marriage applied to the Fulani,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.492
since they always have that
first child and until it's two

00:21:43.492 --> 00:21:45.925
or three,
when they're not married,

00:21:45.925 --> 00:21:49.950
basically all Fulani first
births are illegitimate births,

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:53.180
by our accounting of it.
 

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.440
Among the Dogon people,
which is Mali and Burkina Faso,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:00.377
a girl doesn't move into her
spouse's home until the birth of

00:22:00.377 --> 00:22:02.190
the second or even the third
child.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.829
Speaking of that,
in Sweden, I lived in Sweden

00:22:08.829 --> 00:22:11.500
and we have a guest whose son is
in Sweden,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.491
when I was there,
the tradition was building up

00:22:14.491 --> 00:22:18.200
that you get married on the
birth of your second child.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.250
Is that still happening or--
Student:  No,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.230
they actually don't marry
before the first child.

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:28.041
Prof: Her own son,
but that's because he is a

00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:28.940
foreigner.
 

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.328
In China they have an
interesting system.

00:22:32.328 --> 00:22:34.551
In the old days,
in some places,

00:22:34.551 --> 00:22:39.221
that I don't think I described,
where they have child marriage,

00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:43.255
they marry a boy to an older
girl and the older girl then

00:22:43.255 --> 00:22:47.502
acts as a kind of nanny and
takes care of the boy until they

00:22:47.502 --> 00:22:48.440
grow up.
 

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.346
But they're legally married,
but he's five years or old or

00:22:51.346 --> 00:22:53.713
something,
and she takes care of him until

00:22:53.713 --> 00:22:56.959
he becomes--
she's a surrogate mother until

00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:59.318
he becomes sexually mature.
 

00:22:59.318 --> 00:23:03.055
One of the explanations for the
low rate of Chinese fertility

00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:06.666
within marriage is that boys
rarely have sexual interest in

00:23:06.666 --> 00:23:09.490
their sisters,
at least not for long,

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:12.548
and so this kid grows up and
this girl,

00:23:12.548 --> 00:23:15.018
older girl, has been taking
care of him and by the time they

00:23:15.018 --> 00:23:17.318
get married there's no sexual
interest hardly at all.

00:23:17.318 --> 00:23:21.653
So the rate of intercourse is
very low and the birthrate is

00:23:21.653 --> 00:23:25.240
very low and we talked quite a
bit about that.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.178
Also in traditional China men
can take many wives and men can

00:23:30.178 --> 00:23:31.660
take concubines.
 

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.568
And they can take slaves,
and the distinction among all

00:23:35.568 --> 00:23:38.318
these categories is not very
clear,

00:23:38.318 --> 00:23:41.731
since marriage is usually not a
government function but they go

00:23:41.731 --> 00:23:44.430
to the local Buddhist shrine and
do a variety--

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.929
or Taoist shrine and do a
variety of different practices

00:23:47.929 --> 00:23:49.519
depending on the woman.
 

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:52.318
One of the most common ways--so
the marriage--

00:23:52.318 --> 00:23:54.480
the first--There will often be
a first wife,

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.970
not necessarily the first woman
that's taken into the household

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.236
for the sexual relations with
the husband but what's called

00:24:01.236 --> 00:24:03.769
the first wife and she will be
prominent.

00:24:03.769 --> 00:24:06.838
And then there will be all
kinds--depending on how rich the

00:24:06.838 --> 00:24:08.848
person is, a variety of other
women.

00:24:08.848 --> 00:24:13.977
Apparently one of the frequent
things is that the degree of

00:24:13.977 --> 00:24:18.486
importance of the marriage
depends on how public the

00:24:18.486 --> 00:24:19.990
ceremony was.
 

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:23.994
If there's a big public
ceremony with lots of relatives

00:24:23.994 --> 00:24:27.305
and neighbors invited,
then it's very clear,

00:24:27.305 --> 00:24:30.845
this is a very clear--
this is what we would call a

00:24:30.845 --> 00:24:31.538
marriage.
 

00:24:31.538 --> 00:24:34.016
In other cases,
a woman is just taken in the

00:24:34.016 --> 00:24:37.529
middle of the night and brought
in the house and there's never

00:24:37.529 --> 00:24:41.258
anything public done whatsoever,
and she lives there as a sexual

00:24:41.258 --> 00:24:44.404
partner for the husband and you
can call it married or call it

00:24:44.404 --> 00:24:49.959
not married,
she lives in the house probably

00:24:49.959 --> 00:24:52.400
until she dies.
 

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:58.088
This marriage again is not an
all or nothing kind of thing,

00:24:58.088 --> 00:25:00.650
it will start out with
different levels of status,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:03.045
and then during the course of
the marriage the status can

00:25:03.045 --> 00:25:03.430
change.
 

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:07.330
The husband may become enamored
of the wife and in various ways

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:10.730
raise her status or degrade her
status and so forth.

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:14.848
Now in poor communities,
everywhere--

00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:18.381
you read about this in Brazil
and among people of the United

00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:20.528
States,
a formal marriage has,

00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:24.402
sort of, almost disappeared and
it's replaced by various

00:25:24.402 --> 00:25:25.740
informal unions.
 

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:31.094
And these informal unions,
where there's no legal status

00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:35.157
whatsoever no--
the word marriage is just not

00:25:35.157 --> 00:25:37.826
used,
the state of the relationship

00:25:37.826 --> 00:25:42.068
between the man and the woman is
sort of negotiated daily.

00:25:42.068 --> 00:25:47.638
It can change all the time,
that it's not--again not a

00:25:47.638 --> 00:25:53.420
fixed thing but a very floating
kind of relationship.

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.327
Even in the United States of
course marriage is not a uniform

00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:58.500
legal situation.
 

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.920
Each--marriage has a state law,
it's not a federal--

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:04.259
you don't get married in a
federal situation,

00:26:04.259 --> 00:26:05.509
you get married in a state
situation,

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:08.528
and so there's 50 different
situations altogether,

00:26:08.528 --> 00:26:13.096
and we have prenuptial
agreements which arrange the

00:26:13.096 --> 00:26:18.118
financial relationship between
the man and his wife,

00:26:18.118 --> 00:26:21.528
or vice versa,
and so that can be different.

00:26:21.528 --> 00:26:25.551
In other places even more
issues than just financial are

00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:27.818
arranged by private contract.
 

00:26:27.818 --> 00:26:31.173
It's not set by law,
but by private contract between

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:34.262
the marrying parties,
or more likely between the

00:26:34.262 --> 00:26:35.710
marrying families.
 

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:39.539
A friend of mine,
whose daughter went to college

00:26:39.539 --> 00:26:43.858
in Egypt, went to The American
University in Cairo.

00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:46.471
I was going to say she fell in
love with an Egyptian guy,

00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:47.588
but I don't know that.
 

00:26:47.588 --> 00:26:50.159
They had sex,
I don't know whether they fell

00:26:50.159 --> 00:26:52.728
in love or not,
but she got pregnant and the

00:26:52.728 --> 00:26:54.640
girl decided to get married.
 

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.661
Her parents were divorced and
the girl's father wanted to have

00:26:57.661 --> 00:26:58.848
nothing to do with it.
 

00:26:58.848 --> 00:27:01.960
So, there was the mother,
she had to do something about

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.380
it, and she was opposed to the
marriage.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.029
But the girl didn't listen,
so they were going to go ahead

00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.960
with the marriage.
 

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:10.337
Now in Egypt,
at that time,

00:27:10.337 --> 00:27:15.642
you have to have a marriage
contract and that specifies all

00:27:15.642 --> 00:27:19.210
kinds of rights that the woman
has.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.170
What rights does she have in
her children?

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.223
Without that specified in the
marriage contract,

00:27:24.223 --> 00:27:25.710
they were totally the
husband's.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:28.243
If there's any divorce or
anything, the husband gets them,

00:27:28.243 --> 00:27:29.799
there's no legal case
whatsoever.

00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:31.720
What are her rights to travel?
 

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.240
Can she travel by herself?
 

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.108
Can she go abroad?
 

00:27:35.108 --> 00:27:36.920
Can she travel around Egypt by
herself?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.509
What are her rights to
residence?

00:27:38.509 --> 00:27:42.019
What are her rights to child
custody and so forth?

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:45.606
All of this had to be specified
and there was no husband to do

00:27:45.606 --> 00:27:48.951
it,
so guess who played--ersatz,

00:27:48.951 --> 00:27:55.682
I played the role of the father
and helped negotiate this thing,

00:27:55.682 --> 00:27:57.818
very interesting.
 

00:27:57.818 --> 00:28:03.660
Each marriage means something
different in many places.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.450
You can see that in the DHS
surveys,

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.088
The Demographic and Health
Surveys that I've shown you,

00:28:09.088 --> 00:28:12.842
it never uses the word
marriage, it says 'in union,'

00:28:12.842 --> 00:28:17.109
that's because 'marriage' means
so many different things or

00:28:17.109 --> 00:28:18.950
means nothing at all.
 

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:24.068
Now it's often perceived that
teenage pregnancy and related

00:28:24.068 --> 00:28:28.150
social problems are--
from graphs like that are

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.579
either uniquely American or more
extreme in America,

00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:34.368
but it's not the case.
 

00:28:34.368 --> 00:28:37.833
For instance,
in Japan, of women who are

00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:42.894
teenagers at their first birth,
82% became pregnant before

00:28:42.894 --> 00:28:44.048
marrying.
 

00:28:44.048 --> 00:28:49.880
Of women age 20 to 24,58%
became pregnant before marrying.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.550
And, of all women,
26% became pregnant before

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.470
marrying.
 

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:57.457
In other words,
if a Japanese woman got

00:28:57.457 --> 00:29:02.251
pregnant before her late 20s she
was probably unmarried at the

00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:04.690
time that she got pregnant.
 

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:12.758
These numbers are--well are
numbers that have actual--have

00:29:12.758 --> 00:29:14.740
live births.
 

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.154
As you'll see in the next
lecture, Japan has an extremely

00:29:18.154 --> 00:29:21.621
high rate of abortion,
so these numbers are way--these

00:29:21.621 --> 00:29:25.190
are the women who carry the
birth to term and probably,

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:28.931
at least these are
underestimates by a factor of

00:29:28.931 --> 00:29:33.230
two because this doesn't take
into account abortion.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.662
I've assigned you reading that
discusses this issue from a

00:29:36.662 --> 00:29:41.404
whole variety of perspectives,
and I guess I don't have to

00:29:41.404 --> 00:29:46.608
tell you what it is because
you'll do the reading.

00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:50.423
A little bit of the biological
background to these issues and

00:29:50.423 --> 00:29:53.027
some of this,
I don't have to tell you about,

00:29:53.027 --> 00:29:55.640
because you were teenagers
yourself very recently.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.663
Several things happen at
puberty and there are tremendous

00:29:59.663 --> 00:30:02.538
physical changes,
you've noticed this.

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:04.660
There are tremendous
physiological changes,

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.617
I'm sure you've noticed that,
and there are even tremendous

00:30:07.617 --> 00:30:10.423
emotional changes which of
course you guys wouldn't know

00:30:10.423 --> 00:30:13.381
anything about because you've
been studying too hard to pay

00:30:13.381 --> 00:30:14.808
any attention to this.
 

00:30:14.808 --> 00:30:19.852
Evolution has clearly designed
to have this incredible eruption

00:30:19.852 --> 00:30:22.778
of the ability to get
infatuated,

00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:25.200
to fall in-love,
to have sexual emotions,

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.710
and it all comes on like a ton
of bricks at puberty.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:30.750
This is not by chance,
this is not by culture;

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:35.172
this is straight old mother
evolution doing these things to

00:30:35.172 --> 00:30:35.630
you.
 

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.182
Simultaneously with this,
especially in males,

00:30:39.182 --> 00:30:42.891
there's an eruption--it's not
absent in females,

00:30:42.891 --> 00:30:47.470
a great eruption of revolt
against parental authority.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:49.981
When you were a little kid you
did whatever mommy says,

00:30:49.981 --> 00:30:50.680
more or less.
 

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.460
When you're a teenager,
no go, there's competitiveness,

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.769
there's aggressiveness,
there's violence,

00:30:57.769 --> 00:31:03.176
it onsets at puberty and all of
this is to set a place in the

00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:05.160
dominance hierarchy.
 

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.923
Of course we are,
in the West,

00:31:06.923 --> 00:31:10.632
well aware of these incredible
emotional outbursts and there's

00:31:10.632 --> 00:31:14.403
tons of literature about this of
which probably the most famous

00:31:14.403 --> 00:31:16.410
is Romeo and Juliet.
 

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:18.818
Anybody take a Shakespeare
class?

00:31:18.818 --> 00:31:21.548
How old are Romeo and Juliet
supposed to be?

00:31:21.548 --> 00:31:26.560
13,14, something like that and
what did their great

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:30.269
overpowering love cause them to
do?

00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:32.240
They killed themselves over it.
 

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.478
Very purposely,
they could not live without the

00:31:35.478 --> 00:31:37.450
other--with their partner.
 

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:43.357
This emotion is extraordinarily
strong, even stronger then the

00:31:43.357 --> 00:31:45.490
desire to have life.
 

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.959
Now adolescent sexuality is
more or less disruptive

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:52.910
depending a lot on the culture.
 

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.707
Probably the one most important
variable, is,

00:31:55.707 --> 00:31:58.058
how much teen sexuality is
allowed?

00:31:58.058 --> 00:32:00.970
Does one have an outlet for
these emotions?

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:05.500
If the culture allows an
outlet, in of a variety of ways,

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.191
then it's probably easier for
the adolescent to accommodate

00:32:10.191 --> 00:32:10.920
this.
 

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.011
If, like our culture,
in principle,

00:32:13.011 --> 00:32:15.780
we're not supposed to have an
outlet for this,

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:19.289
then the tensions build up and
strange things happen.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.799
Different societies handle
adolescent sexuality very

00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:27.740
differently.
 

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:32.836
You read the Om Gad
story about the Egyptian woman

00:32:32.836 --> 00:32:37.932
and that is one way in which
traditional societies handle

00:32:37.932 --> 00:32:38.660
sex.
 

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:42.019
You remember that her sexual
initiation began very early;

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:44.710
it began before puberty,
if you remember that.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:48.463
It was introduced with what she
perceived to be a fair amount of

00:32:48.463 --> 00:32:49.118
violence.
 

00:32:49.118 --> 00:32:53.806
Remember on her wedding night
she had no clue what was going

00:32:53.806 --> 00:32:57.856
on and the women come and
investigate her before the

00:32:57.856 --> 00:33:03.019
marriage ceremony and it must be
an extremely scary business.

00:33:03.019 --> 00:33:05.690
Even before that,
the women in Egypt,

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:08.130
all those--well that was only
one woman you read about,

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:11.395
they all had clitorectomies,
which again you read about

00:33:11.395 --> 00:33:11.880
there.
 

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.955
There's a lot of violence
involved in teenage sexuality in

00:33:16.955 --> 00:33:18.558
a lot of places.
 

00:33:18.558 --> 00:33:22.284
It's moderately common,
at least in traditional times,

00:33:22.284 --> 00:33:26.078
that marriage and first
intercourse precede puberty.

00:33:26.078 --> 00:33:30.307
In Iran, for instance,
a few years ago Iran raised the

00:33:30.307 --> 00:33:33.740
legal age of marriage to the age
of nine.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:35.769
I may have mentioned this in a
previous lecture,

00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:38.519
and the conservatives were very
upset about this,

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:41.732
and they were opposed to this
because they considered that

00:33:41.732 --> 00:33:45.173
raising of the marriage age to
be much too liberal for Iranian

00:33:45.173 --> 00:33:45.848
society.
 

00:33:45.848 --> 00:33:50.069
The reason that they chose the
age of nine was that Mohammed

00:33:50.069 --> 00:33:53.075
married his favorite wife,
his second wife,

00:33:53.075 --> 00:33:55.150
Aisha, when she was nine.
 

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:58.554
Again, I warn you,
that getting married doesn't

00:33:58.554 --> 00:34:02.328
necessarily mean the onset of
sexual intercourse.

00:34:02.328 --> 00:34:04.769
We don't have any idea what
happened there,

00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:07.310
but getting married,
like the five year old boys in

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.161
China getting married does not--
you don't know what the means

00:34:11.161 --> 00:34:12.699
with respect to sex.
 

00:34:12.699 --> 00:34:16.653
Just that a contract has been
decided upon and,

00:34:16.653 --> 00:34:20.521
at some stage,
sex will take place between the

00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:21.210
two.
 

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:27.000
With respect to this bill,
parliament actually passed it--

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.878
later on they did raise it to
nine and then a further bill

00:34:30.878 --> 00:34:35.099
came in to raise the age from 9
to 13, but that was blocked.

00:34:35.099 --> 00:34:37.565
The Guardian Council,
which is the conservative

00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:41.382
religious body,
and they thought since Mohammed

00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:46.722
got married at nine that you
couldn't do anything different

00:34:46.722 --> 00:34:47.920
than that.
 

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.880
Now in many parts of the world,
until very recently,

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:56.295
if a girl got into her late
teens or certainly early 20s

00:34:56.295 --> 00:35:00.300
without being married,
it was considered a disaster.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.927
Then she was--by 20,
much too old and she would

00:35:03.927 --> 00:35:07.793
never get married,
she would be a spinster for the

00:35:07.793 --> 00:35:09.449
rest of her life.
 

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:18.177
These cultures had--most
traditional cultures had various

00:35:18.177 --> 00:35:21.840
prescriptions against premarital
sex,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.949
sex before marriage,
and this has several very

00:35:25.949 --> 00:35:27.960
important functions.
 

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.835
One is to ensure the paternity,
if you're married and you got

00:35:31.835 --> 00:35:34.364
pregnant,
then the society can be pretty

00:35:34.364 --> 00:35:37.101
sure of,
or at least can assume legally,

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.943
that the father--
that they know the father,

00:35:39.943 --> 00:35:43.440
and therefore the economic
responsibility for the child is

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.300
very clear.
 

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:49.847
That's one the reasons to have
a fixed legal status of

00:35:49.847 --> 00:35:51.000
marriage.
 

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.760
Back then marriage and puberty
were essentially the same,

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.867
pre-pubescent girls were
all--post pubescent girls they

00:35:59.867 --> 00:36:02.909
got married at puberty and
that's it,

00:36:02.909 --> 00:36:05.376
so a lot of these languages
don't have words that

00:36:05.376 --> 00:36:08.306
distinguish between maiden,
in the sense of a young girl

00:36:08.306 --> 00:36:11.030
and virgin in the sense of a
girl who has not had sex.

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:15.702
There's a large theological
discussion in the Bible when the

00:36:15.702 --> 00:36:18.958
Virgin Mary--
was she a maiden or a virgin

00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:23.315
and the language maybe doesn't
distinguish between these two

00:36:23.315 --> 00:36:24.719
kinds of things.
 

00:36:24.719 --> 00:36:28.500
Another prohibition against
premarital sex,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.570
since puberty and marriage were
often very tightly tied,

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:36.916
that the prohibition against
premarital sex was really

00:36:36.916 --> 00:36:39.128
intended,
in many cases,

00:36:39.128 --> 00:36:42.639
to protect girls from
pre-pubertal sex.

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:47.699
What was--had originally that
goal,

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:51.851
to deal with pre-pubertal sex,
if you retain the legal aspect

00:36:51.851 --> 00:36:54.760
of it until the women marry much
later,

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:01.250
it doesn't anymore have that
kind of function whatsoever.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:07.914
Teenage childbearing was very
common, illegitimacy was very

00:37:07.914 --> 00:37:14.922
common, so the earliest records
we have are from the 1600s and

00:37:14.922 --> 00:37:20.762
the Chesapeake Bay Colony;
way back then guess what

00:37:20.762 --> 00:37:26.045
fraction of women were pregnant
when they got married,

00:37:26.045 --> 00:37:30.829
of married women what fraction
were pregnant?

00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:34.619
Make a guess for the 1600s,
Chesapeake Bay Colony.

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:35.610
Student:  Eighty-five
percent.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.199
Prof: What?
 

00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:37.039
Student:  Eighty-five
percent.

00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:39.699
Prof: Thirty percent,
which is very similar to the

00:37:39.699 --> 00:37:41.869
numbers that we've had until
recently,

00:37:41.869 --> 00:37:44.179
it just seems to be almost a
constant.

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:48.358
They have fairly decent records
through American history and a

00:37:48.358 --> 00:37:52.538
lot of histories and the rates
of premarital pregnancy seem to

00:37:52.538 --> 00:37:53.840
go up and down.
 

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.338
There seem to be large
increases in the late 1600s and

00:37:57.338 --> 00:38:01.034
around 1725 to the earliest
booms of premarital pregnancy

00:38:01.034 --> 00:38:04.929
and I don't have any idea what
the cause of those are,

00:38:04.929 --> 00:38:08.344
but you can go to our professor
of colonial history and try to

00:38:08.344 --> 00:38:08.960
find out.
 

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.072
How were these--why were these
not a social problem these

00:38:13.072 --> 00:38:14.909
premarital pregnancies?
 

00:38:14.909 --> 00:38:18.670
Because what happened then?
 

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:23.840
They got married and those
kinds of marriages are called?

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.159
Shotgun weddings.
 

00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:28.590
Have you all not heard that
word 'shotgun weddings'?

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.972
You get pregnant first then--in
principle the image comes from

00:38:32.972 --> 00:38:36.349
the girl's father carrying a
shotgun saying,

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:38.090
'You're going to marry my
daughter aren't you?'

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:42.449
Those are standardly called
'shotgun weddings'.

00:38:42.449 --> 00:38:45.239
I think I've mentioned to you
that if the mother didn't get

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.992
married,
either because of her

00:38:46.992 --> 00:38:49.500
unwillingness or the guy's
unwillingness,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.664
then she had a real problem,
because in the Anglo-American

00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:55.940
tradition it was not the family
that had responsibility,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:00.070
the village had responsibility
for the unwed child to--

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.500
both the mother and the child
it had to support,

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.213
and for all these villages
living on the edge of

00:39:05.213 --> 00:39:09.599
subsistence this was not--
this was a very big burden.

00:39:09.599 --> 00:39:12.485
I think I mentioned this,
the stories of pregnant women

00:39:12.485 --> 00:39:15.585
being chased from village to
village so that they would not

00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:18.150
have the child in the village
because then,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.409
ever thereafter,
that child is the

00:39:20.409 --> 00:39:22.599
responsibility of the village.
 

00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:30.170
Another thing to keep in mind,
that we talk now a lot about,

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:34.179
is single parent families and
what a bad problem this is.

00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:38.550
It turns out that the
prevalence of single parent

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:41.920
families has always been very
high.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.922
In the 1700s,
for instance,

00:39:43.922 --> 00:39:46.929
this is a quote from a history
book,

00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:49.427
"One the main
characteristics of European

00:39:49.427 --> 00:39:52.481
urban households in the
eighteenth century was the large

00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:55.090
proportion that were headed by
women."

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.829
In Rheims under the Ancien
Regime,

00:39:57.829 --> 00:39:59.929
in France before the French
Revolution,

00:39:59.929 --> 00:40:06.471
one out of four homes was
headed by a woman and 15% to 25%

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:12.440
in all the towns for which they
have data on this.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.943
In the U.S.,
the prevalence--the big divorce

00:40:21.943 --> 00:40:25.920
boom came after the 1950s in
America,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.902
but it turns out that the
prevalence of single parent

00:40:28.902 --> 00:40:32.117
households at the end of the
twentieth century was almost

00:40:32.117 --> 00:40:34.985
identical to that at the
beginning of the twentieth

00:40:34.985 --> 00:40:35.789
century.
 

00:40:35.789 --> 00:40:38.268
What was the difference?
 

00:40:38.268 --> 00:40:43.326
At the end of the century,
single parent households were

00:40:43.326 --> 00:40:47.739
caused by either lack of
marriage or divorce,

00:40:47.739 --> 00:40:51.440
but at the beginning of the
century death,

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:52.840
death of one of the parents.
 

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.887
What has happened is that
marriages on average didn't last

00:40:56.887 --> 00:41:00.934
very long in traditional times,
because one of the parents

00:41:00.934 --> 00:41:03.989
would die;
the death rates were so high.

00:41:03.989 --> 00:41:07.980
They coped with single parent
families because of death,

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.170
and now people psychologically,
apparently,

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:12.829
are not attuned to staying
together for long times,

00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:14.369
or even getting married in the
first place.

00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:17.873
So, now that situation has
changed so that now it's sort of

00:41:17.873 --> 00:41:20.771
voluntary single-parent
families, but the numbers

00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:23.309
surprisingly have changed very
little.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.661
It's another one of these
things that I've talked about in

00:41:30.661 --> 00:41:34.590
history where things change from
being outside of human control,

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:35.960
like whether you're married or
not,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.360
whether you're going to be a
single parent--

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.469
outside of human control are
brought into human control,

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:44.219
it's in some sense under human
choice.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:52.494
What has changed in the modern
West with respect to all of

00:41:52.494 --> 00:41:54.838
this,
and is now spreading everywhere

00:41:54.838 --> 00:41:57.855
is that children are not
supposed to get married as

00:41:57.855 --> 00:41:58.639
teenagers.
 

00:41:58.639 --> 00:42:01.960
If you had gotten married in
high school, probably every

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:05.706
single one of your parents would
have really been very upset by

00:42:05.706 --> 00:42:06.250
that.
 

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:09.235
Of course in the old--In the
essence, it has to do with

00:42:09.235 --> 00:42:09.900
education.
 

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:12.349
In the old days you were a
peasant,

00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:14.351
you were a farmer,
and things were done the way

00:42:14.351 --> 00:42:16.309
they had always been done and
little kids,

00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:18.867
starting at age five,
six, seven started going into

00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:21.119
the fields with his mother or
his father,

00:42:21.119 --> 00:42:23.652
or both of them,
and watching how the farming is

00:42:23.652 --> 00:42:24.030
done.
 

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:27.768
By the time he was a teenager
he had probably learned how you

00:42:27.768 --> 00:42:30.510
do things because it's done
traditionally.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.831
There was no science to it,
there was no quantification or

00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:35.579
arithmetic involved in this.
 

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:36.679
This is the way you did it.
 

00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:39.335
When the moon is at such and
such a phase,

00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:42.317
they have to do this,
you start planting and so

00:42:42.317 --> 00:42:44.518
forth, and you learn all that.
 

00:42:44.518 --> 00:42:48.525
There was no need for the--no
economic need to have a lot of

00:42:48.525 --> 00:42:49.340
education.
 

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.300
Now of course that's turned
around completely.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.746
Even farmers definitely do not
do things in a traditional

00:42:54.746 --> 00:42:57.003
manner;
it requires a lot of education

00:42:57.003 --> 00:43:00.114
to be a very efficient farmer,
and so we need a lot of

00:43:00.114 --> 00:43:04.565
schooling for whatever we do,
so we're not supposed to get

00:43:04.565 --> 00:43:08.530
married until our schooling is
finished.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.777
Your parents would not only
have been mortified if you got

00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:14.284
married in high school,
but they probably would be

00:43:14.284 --> 00:43:16.610
mortified if you got married
before you graduated college.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:20.170
How many of you think your
parents would be very happy if

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.570
you got married now?
 

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.360
How many of you are married?
 

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.376
One, two sorry,
two of the TAs are married and

00:43:27.376 --> 00:43:30.768
they're--TAs are moderately
married.

00:43:30.768 --> 00:43:34.668
Now mostly I teach biology
majors and we all know when the

00:43:34.668 --> 00:43:36.380
biology majors grow up.
 

00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:44.315
Is it when the get their MD or
is it when they finish their

00:43:44.315 --> 00:43:45.059
residency?
 

00:43:45.059 --> 00:43:51.516
That's the big issue and they
generally don't get married

00:43:51.516 --> 00:43:53.130
before that.
 

00:43:53.130 --> 00:44:00.228
Now we have to do a little
quantification of all of this,

00:44:00.228 --> 00:44:07.579
so here is the crux of the
problem, and this is in 1890.

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:11.231
Menarche of course is the onset
of the menses,

00:44:11.231 --> 00:44:16.262
and presumably more or less the
time of beginning of fertility,

00:44:16.262 --> 00:44:19.670
and that was at about 15 years
of age.

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.139
Now with presumably increased
nutrition,

00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:26.440
although the reasons are still
somewhat questionable,

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:31.389
the age of menarche is now
12.5, so this period has been

00:44:31.389 --> 00:44:33.099
extended forward.
 

00:44:33.099 --> 00:44:37.795
The age at marriage was 22 in
1890, the average age of

00:44:37.795 --> 00:44:41.340
marriage for women,
this is for women.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.217
The period was still
fairly--between the onset

00:44:45.217 --> 00:44:49.610
presumably of sexual desire and
the "legitimate

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:52.110
realization"
of it,

00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:55.710
at marriage,
was about 7.5 years and then

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.400
very rapidly a first birth would
occur.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.835
Now what happens is you go to
1988, menarche becomes earlier

00:45:03.835 --> 00:45:08.195
and marriage becomes a lot
later, and now both these things

00:45:08.195 --> 00:45:10.300
have expanded even more.
 

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:16.463
Now the period of time between
the onset of adolescence and

00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:21.827
sexual desires and marriage,
becomes longer and as time goes

00:45:21.827 --> 00:45:26.099
on this gets longer and longer
and it's the same story for men.

00:45:26.099 --> 00:45:29.554
We don't have good early data
on spermarche,

00:45:29.554 --> 00:45:34.376
but marriage is even later than
for women, so for men is 12.5

00:45:34.376 --> 00:45:35.179
years.
 

00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:39.891
That's a very long period of
time in the lifecycle of a man

00:45:39.891 --> 00:45:43.356
especially,
not much less for a woman,

00:45:43.356 --> 00:45:48.280
and especially during the
fertile years say 15 to 40,

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:53.150
like 25 fertile years this
is--or 35 this is half or

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:58.306
somewhat less than half of your
total fertile period is

00:45:58.306 --> 00:45:59.739
premarital.
 

00:45:59.739 --> 00:46:03.527
Quantitatively,
that's probably where the

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.800
social issue comes up.
 

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:09.018
Way before 1890s,
in traditional societies,

00:46:09.018 --> 00:46:12.320
menarche and marriage come at
the same time,

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:15.101
there's no real interval there
so there's not a social problem

00:46:15.101 --> 00:46:18.262
of what to--
the social problem is what to

00:46:18.262 --> 00:46:21.829
do with sexuality in this
interval here.

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:24.385
In traditional times,
when our religions grew up and

00:46:24.385 --> 00:46:26.789
most of our cultural
presuppositions grew up,

00:46:26.789 --> 00:46:29.929
there was no period,
or extremely little period,

00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:35.289
between the onset of
adolescence and marriage.

00:46:35.289 --> 00:46:39.208
As time goes on and the need
for education increases,

00:46:39.208 --> 00:46:43.581
that period between onset of
adolescence and marriage grows

00:46:43.581 --> 00:46:45.239
longer and longer.
 

00:46:45.239 --> 00:46:49.260
There becomes this very long
social period in which,

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.199
by some social conventions,
you're not supposed to have

00:46:52.199 --> 00:46:54.637
sex,
the child is still a child in a

00:46:54.637 --> 00:46:56.925
sense,
not supposed to have sex but

00:46:56.925 --> 00:47:00.750
the biology is telling them that
yes they want it very much.

00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:03.619
Societies have had,
Western societies especially,

00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:05.840
but the rest of the world is
not any different,

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.398
have had a long--have had a lot
of trouble and are still in the

00:47:09.398 --> 00:47:12.898
middle of having difficulty with
deciding what to do with this

00:47:12.898 --> 00:47:13.530
period.
 

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.750
What are the morals,
what are the ethics,

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.969
what's the religious attitudes
that should take place about

00:47:18.969 --> 00:47:20.690
sexuality in these periods.
 

00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:25.951
This whole lecture basically,
this whole problem of teenage

00:47:25.951 --> 00:47:29.670
sexuality is due to that problem
there.

00:47:38.539 --> 00:47:42.197
Now if you look at the time
what has happened,

00:47:42.197 --> 00:47:46.099
what has happened to sexuality
in this period?

00:47:46.099 --> 00:47:50.744
Well what do you think has
happened to the frequency of sex

00:47:50.744 --> 00:47:53.869
among teenagers,
unmarried teenagers?

00:47:53.869 --> 00:47:57.458
Up, well yes that is correct,
here's data,

00:47:57.458 --> 00:48:02.623
this data is not--you want to
bring the data more up to date

00:48:02.623 --> 00:48:05.250
but we just don't have it.
 

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:11.159
Here's women starting in 1956,
after World War II,

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:15.240
there's a very conservative
period in America where the war

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.940
was very disruptive,
they had the big depression,

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:18.480
then the war.
 

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.983
People wanted to go back to a
traditional way of living:

00:48:20.983 --> 00:48:22.760
a little white house in the
suburbs,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.737
a man and a wife,
and a white picket fence around

00:48:25.737 --> 00:48:28.750
it,
and the fraction of teenage

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.666
women--this is teenagers,
having sex was like still a

00:48:33.666 --> 00:48:36.300
quarter--
more than a quarter so it was

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.719
not zero by any means.
 

00:48:37.719 --> 00:48:42.092
Then as time goes on it goes
higher and higher and now it's

00:48:42.092 --> 00:48:44.130
sort of doubled the rate.
 

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:48.695
Not now, this is 1980,
late 1980s, so we've progressed

00:48:48.695 --> 00:48:54.036
another 20,30 years since then
and it's just continued to creep

00:48:54.036 --> 00:48:54.639
up.
 

00:48:54.639 --> 00:48:59.137
This is for females and this is
for males showing the same

00:48:59.137 --> 00:48:59.768
thing.
 

00:48:59.768 --> 00:49:03.500
So, yes, indeed,
sex has increased.

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.340
No question about that.
 

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.500
What do you think has happened
to the teen birthrate?

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:11.619
This is really what people
don't realize.

00:49:11.619 --> 00:49:15.824
During that same period,
when the frequency of teen sex

00:49:15.824 --> 00:49:20.574
was rising quite noticeably,
the teen birthrate went from 80

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:23.590
or even 90 in the middle 1950s
during--

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.139
where that other graph started
in the middle of this

00:49:26.139 --> 00:49:29.139
conservative period there was a
very high teen birthrate,

00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:33.349
and then it's gone down and
it's continued on down,

00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:37.090
it's now down to about this
level, about 40 currently.

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:41.436
These graphs were all done
during this period of peak--its

00:49:41.436 --> 00:49:44.030
being at peak as a social issue.
 

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.603
This bump here,
where it raised temporarily,

00:49:47.603 --> 00:49:49.099
was significant.
 

00:49:49.099 --> 00:49:54.762
You're going from 50 to 60 or
something, which is a 20%

00:49:54.762 --> 00:49:57.489
increase in teen births.
 

00:49:57.489 --> 00:50:02.538
No one really knows what that
is, but sort of the presumption

00:50:02.538 --> 00:50:06.829
it was the Reagan and Bush 'just
say no' period,

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:10.639
where social programs to combat
pregnancy,

00:50:10.639 --> 00:50:12.670
largely sex education,
were frowned upon,

00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:16.239
were put down and the result
was an increase.

00:50:16.239 --> 00:50:19.717
That's very conjectural,
we really don't have a way of

00:50:19.717 --> 00:50:23.657
finding out what caused that but
since that's over--it's come

00:50:23.657 --> 00:50:28.547
back down and continued to fall;
every year basically the rate

00:50:28.547 --> 00:50:33.079
of teen pregnancy gets less than
the previous year.

00:50:33.079 --> 00:50:35.639
It's still a big problem.
 

00:50:35.639 --> 00:50:39.592
Of course I showed you in the
first graph, there's still about

00:50:39.592 --> 00:50:42.768
a half a million teenage
pregnancies each year.

00:50:42.768 --> 00:50:47.929
That is, in the American
context, about half what it used

00:50:47.929 --> 00:50:51.342
to be,
but in the world--it's

00:50:51.342 --> 00:50:58.268
middling, it's more than in
Europe and less than in a lot of

00:50:58.268 --> 00:51:00.500
other countries.
 

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.885
If you break this down,
this decline in teen

00:51:02.885 --> 00:51:05.715
childbearing you can average it
out, it's 1% a year,

00:51:05.715 --> 00:51:07.989
kind of continually,
since the 1950s.

00:51:07.989 --> 00:51:11.657
In the last 50 years teenage
pregnancy has dropped on average

00:51:11.657 --> 00:51:13.860
1% a year very,
very consistently.

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.250
You can break it down.
 

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.889
It's dropped in all 50 states.
 

00:51:16.889 --> 00:51:19.117
If you break it down
geographically,

00:51:19.117 --> 00:51:22.556
it's dropped in all ethnic
groups, you pick your ethnic

00:51:22.556 --> 00:51:25.550
groups, the teen pregnancy rate
has fallen.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.251
Especially during the peak of
the crisis, there was a special

00:51:29.251 --> 00:51:32.583
worry about poor teenagers,
and at that time that meant

00:51:32.583 --> 00:51:34.250
mostly black teenagers.
 

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:39.398
The rate of drop of teen
pregnancy among black teenagers

00:51:39.398 --> 00:51:44.081
has been about twice the rate of
drop among whites,

00:51:44.081 --> 00:51:47.920
so they've come much closer
together.

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:51.090
It's not only childbearing,
but actual pregnancy rates.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.909
This is childbearing rates,
if I put up pregnancy rates it

00:51:54.909 --> 00:51:57.190
would look pretty much the same.
 

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.230
Now we've got a problem here.
 

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:04.041
We've said that the rate of
teen pregnancy something like

00:52:04.041 --> 00:52:07.681
doubled and the rate of teen--
sorry the rate of teen

00:52:07.681 --> 00:52:12.514
sexuality somewhat doubled,
yet the rate of teen childbirth

00:52:12.514 --> 00:52:16.047
went in half,
so there's a factor of four

00:52:16.047 --> 00:52:18.018
that we have to explain.
 

00:52:18.018 --> 00:52:22.155
What we think should have
doubled in fact went down by a

00:52:22.155 --> 00:52:23.360
factor of two.
 

00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.489
What is the factor here?
 

00:52:28.489 --> 00:52:32.019
What do teens start to do?
 

00:52:32.019 --> 00:52:33.269
What?
 

00:52:33.269 --> 00:52:34.590
Student:  Married more.
 

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:35.480
Prof: They what?
 

00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.260
Student:  Married.
 

00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.954
Prof: No,
no marriage--I'll show you

00:52:38.954 --> 00:52:40.429
marriage in a minute.
 

00:52:40.429 --> 00:52:43.947
In fact I will show you
marriage, good that's a good

00:52:43.947 --> 00:52:44.500
point.
 

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:49.686
This is marriage rates for
different ages and here is women

00:52:49.686 --> 00:52:52.460
in the prime age of marriage.
 

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:56.768
This is the marriage rate--in
1960 marriage disappears,

00:52:56.768 --> 00:53:00.199
marriage falls off the face of
the cliff.

00:53:00.199 --> 00:53:01.429
Student:  Birthrate.
 

00:53:01.429 --> 00:53:04.659
Prof: I'm sorry
birthrate, yes sorry my mistake.

00:53:04.659 --> 00:53:10.822
The birthrate drops
tremendously and what happens in

00:53:10.822 --> 00:53:14.690
the early 1960s to cause that?
 

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.639
Student:  The pill.
 

00:53:16.639 --> 00:53:19.333
Prof: The pill,
the birth control pill,

00:53:19.333 --> 00:53:21.789
so this is a pure technological
effect.

00:53:21.789 --> 00:53:24.911
This kind of drop,
we've seen this for China,

00:53:24.911 --> 00:53:28.599
and when Mexico legalized
contraception you get these

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:29.309
drops.
 

00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:33.193
This is 15 years it goes from
250 down to less than 125,

00:53:33.193 --> 00:53:37.429
it drops by a factor of two in
15 years, an enormous drop.

00:53:37.429 --> 00:53:43.824
This is all a technological
drop due to the availability of

00:53:43.824 --> 00:53:49.449
modern contraception,
and the pill in particular.

00:53:49.449 --> 00:53:52.030
We've seen that kind of--That
means that,

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:55.123
at this point in time,
when the birthrate was one out

00:53:55.123 --> 00:53:58.099
of every four women every year
of fertile ages,

00:53:58.099 --> 00:53:59.900
that's a very--that's a pretty
high rate.

00:53:59.900 --> 00:54:03.130
That means that--I mean the
other social indicators don't

00:54:03.130 --> 00:54:05.304
change so much,
like the economy or the amount

00:54:05.304 --> 00:54:06.969
of female education or anything
like that,

00:54:06.969 --> 00:54:08.030
not so rapidly.
 

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.630
So this means that at that time
there must have been a fairly

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:13.849
large desire to stop
childbearing,

00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:17.534
but there wasn't the technology
available and so as soon as the

00:54:17.534 --> 00:54:20.268
technology is available the
birthrate drops.

00:54:20.268 --> 00:54:23.271
Now for teenagers,
here's age 15 to 19,

00:54:23.271 --> 00:54:28.012
you also get a drop also at the
same time, but it's much more

00:54:28.012 --> 00:54:28.960
gradual.
 

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.360
Why is that?
 

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:33.047
That's--
Student:  I'm sorry,

00:54:33.047 --> 00:54:35.483
if I could ask you a question,
have you factored in the

00:54:35.483 --> 00:54:37.739
legalization of abortion which
took place in--

00:54:37.739 --> 00:54:41.097
Prof: The legalization
of abortion is probably this

00:54:41.097 --> 00:54:42.099
blip down here.
 

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.413
No, that's later,
that was 1973 so that's down

00:54:49.413 --> 00:54:51.817
here,
the fertility drop

00:54:51.817 --> 00:54:58.210
is--contraception gets legalized
in 1965 and abortion in 1973,

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:02.313
so it's too late for that but
the availability of

00:55:02.313 --> 00:55:05.989
contraception and the
legalization of it.

00:55:05.989 --> 00:55:12.844
So, in 1960 contraception
between married people is not

00:55:12.844 --> 00:55:13.860
legal.
 

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.077
It was in 1965,
so partway through this drop,

00:55:17.077 --> 00:55:20.880
that it became legal but it was
used very heavily.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:23.824
As in China,
with the one child policy was

00:55:23.824 --> 00:55:26.340
just rampant ignoring of the
law.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.030
It was the Supreme Court case
that was fought--

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:32.338
there was a Connecticut case,
the Planned Parenthood of

00:55:32.338 --> 00:55:34.849
Connecticut did the
contraception law,

00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:38.250
did the case that made
contraception legal for married

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:41.971
people and it was later that
unmarried people got the right

00:55:41.971 --> 00:55:43.639
to have contraception.
 

00:55:43.639 --> 00:55:48.599
The birthrate drops for married
women,

00:55:48.599 --> 00:55:52.719
but for teenagers it drops much
more slowly,

00:55:52.719 --> 00:55:58.250
and that's the tradeoff between
that they're having more sex so

00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:01.782
you expect it to go up,
but they're using

00:56:01.782 --> 00:56:04.280
contraception,
so it's going down.

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.556
Whereas these women,
married women at that age were

00:56:06.556 --> 00:56:09.661
having sex before this period,
so what you see is all the

00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:13.547
contraceptive effect and there's
no increase in sexual frequency

00:56:13.547 --> 00:56:15.150
to counterbalance that.
 

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:19.179
This is you would expect--well
this would be--

00:56:19.179 --> 00:56:21.130
this is the full contraceptive
effect,

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:25.588
this is the contraceptive
effect minus the increased

00:56:25.588 --> 00:56:27.250
sexuality effect.
 

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.041
We know that something like
three-quarters of sexually

00:56:37.041 --> 00:56:40.264
active teenagers,
and this is for a long time,

00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:44.268
used contraception and they're
amazingly good--

00:56:44.268 --> 00:56:45.929
they're not dumb about it at
all.

00:56:45.929 --> 00:56:49.126
They, in general,
use contraception at least as

00:56:49.126 --> 00:56:51.699
effectively as adults and in
many--

00:56:51.699 --> 00:56:56.202
in several of the studies,
they used contraception more

00:56:56.202 --> 00:56:58.369
effectively than adults.
 

00:56:58.369 --> 00:57:03.699
If contraception hadn't come in
at that time,

00:57:03.699 --> 00:57:07.675
you would have seen a
tremendous rise in teen

00:57:07.675 --> 00:57:10.112
pregnancy,
in teen births,

00:57:10.112 --> 00:57:13.230
whereas, in fact,
you saw a gentle,

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:17.429
a 1% a year,
a gentle drop in teen births.

00:57:22.768 --> 00:57:30.617
Cross-national studies show
quite convincingly that the

00:57:30.617 --> 00:57:34.766
drop--
that the moderation of this

00:57:34.766 --> 00:57:41.181
drop that why teen pregnancy
didn't rise when teen sex rose

00:57:41.181 --> 00:57:44.280
was due to contraception.
 

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.163
In Canada, U.S.,
Sweden, France,

00:57:46.163 --> 00:57:48.896
Great Britain,
the age of sexual debut doesn't

00:57:48.896 --> 00:57:52.300
change very much when you go
across these countries.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:56.246
About 40% of the 15 to 17 year
olds have already have

00:57:56.246 --> 00:58:00.726
intercourse and this rises to
70% to 80% among 18 to 19 year

00:58:00.726 --> 00:58:01.409
olds.
 

00:58:01.409 --> 00:58:02.630
In fact, the U.S.
 

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:06.364
had a significantly lower
percentage of girls who had

00:58:06.364 --> 00:58:10.530
intercourse in the past three
months than--at the year this

00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:12.686
was taken, say 59% in the U.S.
 

00:58:12.686 --> 00:58:14.409
and 79% in Sweden.
 

00:58:14.409 --> 00:58:16.920
So we had less sexuality than
the other countries.

00:58:16.920 --> 00:58:23.099
Even though we had a lower
amount of sexual activity,

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:26.599
the teen pregnancy rate,
the teen birthrate,

00:58:26.599 --> 00:58:30.159
the teen sexually transmitted
disease rates were much higher,

00:58:30.159 --> 00:58:34.637
and again, if you compare the
use of contraception in Europe

00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:39.344
it's much better than here and
that explains all these problems

00:58:39.344 --> 00:58:41.090
with the sexuality.
 

00:58:41.090 --> 00:58:46.391
Non-use of contraception in the
United States was five times as

00:58:46.391 --> 00:58:51.692
great as that of Great Britain
and three times as great as that

00:58:51.692 --> 00:58:52.889
in Sweden.
 

00:58:52.889 --> 00:58:56.018
The effect is not concentrated
in lower economic groups,

00:58:56.018 --> 00:58:59.039
that's a somewhat interesting
fact,

00:58:59.039 --> 00:59:01.280
almost everything else breaks
out by economic groups,

00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:05.612
and contraception use among
teenagers doesn't vary that much

00:59:05.612 --> 00:59:08.110
among different economic groups.
 

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:16.280
Now--so what's the problem here?
 

00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:20.476
We start out that there was
or--and still there appears to

00:59:20.476 --> 00:59:23.789
be a huge problem with teen
pregnancy and--

00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:26.440
but we see that in actual fact
the data contradicts that.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:29.621
Teen pregnancy has been
declining rather steadily,

00:59:29.621 --> 00:59:33.650
1% a year for the last 50 years
and is now half of what it used

00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:34.300
to be.
 

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:42.654
There's a whole discussion,
we can discuss teenage abortion

00:59:42.654 --> 00:59:46.666
rates, but what has happened is
the disappearance of shotgun

00:59:46.666 --> 00:59:47.550
weddings.
 

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:50.380
This data is pre-maritally
pregnant women,

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.800
this is a somewhat wider age
range,

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:57.327
not teenage but 15 to 29,
and what fraction got married

00:59:57.327 --> 00:59:59.940
before the birth of their first
child?

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.360
They're pregnant before this
graph happens,

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.010
sometime later they may,
or may not,

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.465
get married,
what fraction of them get

01:00:06.465 --> 01:00:08.119
married before the birth of
their child?

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:09.829
They're pregnant,
the child's born,

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:11.690
and do they get married in
between?

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:17.907
Traditional shotgun wedding and
here--there it is,

01:00:17.907 --> 01:00:20.320
it's getting bad.
 

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:24.630
You can see it was fairly
stable for many years and then

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:29.237
boom it just falls off,
that's white women,

01:00:29.237 --> 01:00:35.449
here's total women you can see,
Hispanic, and black women.

01:00:35.449 --> 01:00:38.621
What disappears,
it's not an issue with sexual

01:00:38.621 --> 01:00:41.369
activity it's an issue with
marriage.

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:47.713
That the problem is that
marriage drops much faster than

01:00:47.713 --> 01:00:53.019
the teenagers or anybody else
can cope with.

01:00:56.829 --> 01:00:59.476
What happens,
and here is the source of the

01:00:59.476 --> 01:01:01.597
problem,
that even though the teen

01:01:01.597 --> 01:01:04.110
birthrate during this period is
declining,

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:07.880
the non-martial teen birthrate
is rising and that's one of the

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.219
things that people always don't
distinguish between.

01:01:11.219 --> 01:01:14.599
It was this,
the non-marital teen birthrate,

01:01:14.599 --> 01:01:17.429
that was making real social
issue.

01:01:17.429 --> 01:01:21.099
It was not the total birthrate,
but the unmarried birthrate.

01:01:27.039 --> 01:01:30.510
This was enough of a social
problem,

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.599
but without the teen use of
contraception,

01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:37.855
the problem--remember we
thought we should have seen a

01:01:37.855 --> 01:01:41.949
doubling of teen pregnancy and
we saw a halving,

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:44.563
a cutting in half,
so there is a factor of four

01:01:44.563 --> 01:01:47.193
difference,
this would have risen four

01:01:47.193 --> 01:01:50.860
times as fast without teenage
use of contraception.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.340
Again that's the--we started
with it--that's one of the big

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.440
social issues:
Should teens be given

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.518
contraception?
 

01:01:57.518 --> 01:02:00.199
And I think the data here shows
that,

01:02:00.199 --> 01:02:03.190
I don't make any kind of moral
statement or ethical statement,

01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:07.175
but that if they don't have it
than non-martial teen birthrate

01:02:07.175 --> 01:02:08.940
is going to be fantastic.
 

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.780
Question, I thought somebody
raised their hand?

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.610
No.
 

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:19.476
Okay now you have the
reading--there's all kinds of

01:02:19.476 --> 01:02:27.992
programs that are supposed to do
something about teen pregnancy

01:02:27.992 --> 01:02:32.250
and you'll read about this.
 

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:36.021
One of these is virginity
pledges, the abstinence only

01:02:36.021 --> 01:02:39.010
programs, various conservative
measures.

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:45.907
There's now good studies of all
of these and none of them work

01:02:45.907 --> 01:02:51.449
and the information on that is
in your reading.

01:02:51.449 --> 01:02:55.675
Here is the story on--with this
drop in marriage,

01:02:55.675 --> 01:02:59.989
and this is all women,
it's not just teenagers.

01:02:59.989 --> 01:03:04.250
Look at the rise in unmarried
births.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:09.273
It's about a third of all
births are to unmarried women of

01:03:09.273 --> 01:03:14.650
all ages and that's continued on
in a slow rise since then.

01:03:14.650 --> 01:03:22.679
This is kind of a huge sea
change in American childbearing

01:03:22.679 --> 01:03:24.369
practices.
 

01:03:24.369 --> 01:03:30.231
It's going from almost always
within marriage to a very large

01:03:30.231 --> 01:03:33.260
fraction outside of marriage.
 

01:03:33.260 --> 01:03:39.416
Here--so this is the
birthrate--so mostly among older

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:45.219
women, it's rising,
over 40 its low but rising.

01:03:45.219 --> 01:03:48.309
35 to 39 it's rising.
 

01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:51.360
30 to 34 slightly rising.
 

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:55.010
25 to 29 a little bit rising.
 

01:03:55.010 --> 01:04:01.126
And the only group that's
having a lower birthrate are the

01:04:01.126 --> 01:04:03.380
15 to 19 year olds.
 

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:08.510
You can see that their line is
definitely sloping down,

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:14.452
so this marriage problem--this
is the change in birthrates and

01:04:14.452 --> 01:04:19.615
the only one that's having a
smaller birthrate are the

01:04:19.615 --> 01:04:20.980
teenagers.
 

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:26.449
This is now the unmarried
birthrate and here you see,

01:04:26.449 --> 01:04:31.780
again 35 to 39 year old women
very much increased,

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.539
again the 30 to 34--the
different ages,

01:04:35.539 --> 01:04:38.420
all the ages of women have an
increasing rate,

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:40.630
an unmarried birthrate,
except the teenagers.

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:44.889
Here's the 15 to 17 year olds,
they are falling down,

01:04:44.889 --> 01:04:48.199
and here this dark blue line is
18 to 19 year olds,

01:04:48.199 --> 01:04:53.746
so whether it's 15 to 19 that's
the only group in America in

01:04:53.746 --> 01:04:57.599
which unwed childbearing is
going down.

01:04:57.599 --> 01:05:00.375
Student:  Is this a
percentage or is this just a

01:05:00.375 --> 01:05:02.019
proportion, or a total number?
 

01:05:02.019 --> 01:05:04.800
Prof: Rate per thousand.
 

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.789
I don't know if you can see
this, its rate per thousand,

01:05:07.789 --> 01:05:09.909
ten per 1000,20 per 1000,40 per
1000.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:20.980
Student:  Do you know if
the programs from 15 to 18 year

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:24.070
olds is successful at all or is
it--

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:27.092
Prof: No,
the data has been--most of the

01:05:27.092 --> 01:05:29.590
programs work on younger kids
and--

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:32.797
Student:  Is that why
it's not going up as much as the

01:05:32.797 --> 01:05:33.280
others?
 

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.889
Prof: That is in debate.
 

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.518
No, no the abstinence programs
no.

01:05:37.518 --> 01:05:39.360
There's two sets of programs
competing,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:42.244
one are abstinence type
programs, virginity pledges and

01:05:42.244 --> 01:05:45.291
the other is sex education
programs and you have to have a

01:05:45.291 --> 01:05:48.068
very good study to figure out
what's going on for any

01:05:48.068 --> 01:05:49.940
particular group of students.
 

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.168
I put in your reading packet
some of the best studies of

01:05:53.168 --> 01:05:53.579
this.
 

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:55.840
Here's another interesting sort
of factor,

01:05:55.840 --> 01:06:00.454
that if you break teenage
birthrates out by state in

01:06:00.454 --> 01:06:03.969
America,
the red states have the ten

01:06:03.969 --> 01:06:07.610
highest rates and they are the
south,

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:09.659
the south belt here.
 

01:06:09.659 --> 01:06:13.346
The most conservative and
most--and the ones with the

01:06:13.346 --> 01:06:17.411
lowest it's New England,
New Jersey, upper Midwest,

01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:22.375
the most conservative and the
most religious parts of America

01:06:22.375 --> 01:06:26.760
are the ones that have the
highest teen birthrate.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:30.360
Again, you have to be careful
about over-interpreting this

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.331
data because what you might--
they get married young there

01:06:34.331 --> 01:06:38.570
also, so a fair amount of this
is marital teen birthrate,

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:41.690
and again the data isn't
readily available.

01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:44.045
At least I haven't been able to
find it--what you're worried

01:06:44.045 --> 01:06:46.282
about is the un--or you think
you're worried about is the

01:06:46.282 --> 01:06:47.440
unmarried teen birthrate.
 

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.289
Not a lot of people--some are
worried about teen birthrate,

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:52.840
period, because it means people
are not getting it--

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:56.239
the teenagers are not getting
education and so forth.

01:06:56.239 --> 01:07:02.108
Like most other things that the
social practices in the more

01:07:02.108 --> 01:07:07.480
conservative regions of the
country lead to a very--

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:14.795
a lower age of when people have
births and not surprising at

01:07:14.795 --> 01:07:15.539
all.
 

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:28.960
Now I want to expand this
internationally a little bit,

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.768
so we've talked about America.
 

01:07:30.768 --> 01:07:39.719
Here is the country and this is
teenagers--

01:07:39.719 --> 01:07:44.840
who have ever had sex,
two different columns,

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:48.309
and one column is male and one
column is female,

01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:51.409
and I cut off by mistake which
sex it was.

01:07:51.409 --> 01:07:58.960
Is it obvious which sex is
which here?

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.387
The left column you'll notice
is consistently larger than the

01:08:03.387 --> 01:08:06.601
right column,
so it should be pretty easy to

01:08:06.601 --> 01:08:09.719
figure out which is male and
which is female.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:10.960
Student:  Male is left.
 

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.534
Prof: Male is on the
left, how many people agree with

01:08:13.534 --> 01:08:13.840
that?
 

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.788
How many people think it's
going to be the opposite?

01:08:16.788 --> 01:08:19.000
Why do you think it's going to
be the opposite?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.886
Student:  Because when
they're consistently get married

01:08:20.886 --> 01:08:22.210
and have--
Prof: What?

01:08:22.210 --> 01:08:23.854
Student:  Women are
going to consistently get

01:08:23.854 --> 01:08:25.404
married and have sex,
whereas men in a polygamous

01:08:25.404 --> 01:08:26.630
society might have to wait
longer.

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:29.550
Prof: Right,
exactly right.

01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:32.012
Here it is, the first column is
indeed women,

01:08:32.012 --> 01:08:35.148
so you see now the point is
very different considerations

01:08:35.148 --> 01:08:35.819
come in.
 

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.270
This is all an effect of age at
marriage,

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:44.130
and so here is the complete
graph as it was published,

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:49.289
and notice the fraction of
teenage men that are in union,

01:08:49.289 --> 01:08:50.390
almost none.
 

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:55.479
Remember we talked about that,
that the old men keep the young

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:59.893
guys from getting married,
and these are about 25% across

01:08:59.893 --> 01:09:03.350
the countries are in union with
men who are older,

01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:07.273
therefore they've had more sex
than the young males who have

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.800
not had the opportunity to have
sex.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.225
So this is part of what I've
described before about the power

01:09:13.225 --> 01:09:15.340
structure and the money
structure,

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:20.332
that the old men keep the young
men in a kind of a state of

01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:24.380
frustration and the females have
sex earlier.

01:09:31.948 --> 01:09:36.632
Now you can look at different
countries and a lot of people

01:09:36.632 --> 01:09:40.099
again,
this discussion of sexuality is

01:09:40.099 --> 01:09:45.402
very often tied in with ideas of
religious morals and you can

01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:49.060
look at Ireland,
you can look at religion,

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:53.676
you can look around the world
at countries that have different

01:09:53.676 --> 01:09:58.064
religions and one of the most
Catholic countries is Ireland

01:09:58.064 --> 01:10:02.829
and more than half of all babies
are born to mothers under 25 so

01:10:02.829 --> 01:10:07.712
they have a low age of birth,
and about half of those are

01:10:07.712 --> 01:10:09.720
born outside of marriage.
 

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:12.722
If half your babies are born
before you're 25 and half of

01:10:12.722 --> 01:10:15.779
those are illegitimate that
means that all the babies,

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.810
just from the young women
having babies,

01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:20.538
that's 25% of your total babies
are illegitimate.

01:10:20.538 --> 01:10:26.192
When you add in the
illegitimacy of children born to

01:10:26.192 --> 01:10:32.841
women over 25 then it--the Irish
comes to equal or exceed the

01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:33.284
U.S.
 

01:10:33.284 --> 01:10:36.500
rate of about one-third.
 

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.476
If you compare the Irish
illegitimacy rate to white

01:10:40.476 --> 01:10:43.175
American women,
which is in some sense the

01:10:43.175 --> 01:10:46.627
proper comparison group,
the Irish rate's way higher,

01:10:46.627 --> 01:10:49.828
about 50% higher than the
American rate.

01:10:49.828 --> 01:10:52.530
Now you go to the other side,
New Zealand is an old fashion

01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:53.510
Protestant country.
 

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:59.670
It has the--a very retro
feeling when you visit it.

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:05.869
She was--you've been there
yes--they--38% of all births in

01:11:05.869 --> 01:11:09.460
New Zealand are out of wedlock.
 

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:14.402
In England it's nearly 40% of
births and they have the same

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:17.072
problem,
a third of marriages end in

01:11:17.072 --> 01:11:20.729
divorce and ever-increasing
numbers of people see marriage

01:11:20.729 --> 01:11:23.810
as just an irrelevant thing and
don't bother.

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:27.252
In Japan, I think I gave you
these things,

01:11:27.252 --> 01:11:31.618
26% of first births are to
women who conceived before

01:11:31.618 --> 01:11:32.710
marriage.
 

01:11:36.908 --> 01:11:38.819
In Japan, and I guess I
mentioned this before;

01:11:38.819 --> 01:11:42.618
they have such a high rate of
abortion that you can't tell

01:11:42.618 --> 01:11:45.618
very much from the actual
childbirth rates.

01:11:45.618 --> 01:11:48.703
We're coming to the end,
we are at the end,

01:11:48.703 --> 01:11:50.979
and there's lots more to say.
 

01:11:50.979 --> 01:11:53.270
Let me tell you one more thing.
 

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.670
The whole pattern of
childbearing is changing

01:11:55.670 --> 01:11:58.288
drastically, especially in
poorer communities.

01:11:58.288 --> 01:12:01.960
It's very difficult for poor
people to bring up children

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.229
because they just have no money.
 

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:07.529
What's happening is who
actually brings up,

01:12:07.529 --> 01:12:10.750
say, largely black children in
America?

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:12.698
Is it the mothers?
 

01:12:12.698 --> 01:12:15.310
It's the grandmother,
a very common pattern.

01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:19.944
I don't know if--it's that the
grandmothers are bringing up the

01:12:19.944 --> 01:12:24.282
children and we get up--the
white dominant group gets upset

01:12:24.282 --> 01:12:25.180
by this.
 

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:28.131
But actually it's a split
between the biological act of

01:12:28.131 --> 01:12:31.630
parenting and the psychological
and economic act of parenting.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:34.518
The kids get married--get
pregnant quite young,

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:37.532
but they're probably
biologically very capable of

01:12:37.532 --> 01:12:40.859
pregnancy at the ages at which
they get pregnant.

01:12:40.859 --> 01:12:42.908
In some sense,
from a biological point of

01:12:42.908 --> 01:12:45.146
view,
getting pregnant in your late

01:12:45.146 --> 01:12:47.479
teenage maybe a biological
optimum,

01:12:47.479 --> 01:12:49.595
but they are not
psychologically prepared to be a

01:12:49.595 --> 01:12:51.845
parent and they're not
economically prepared to be a

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:52.328
parent.
 

01:12:52.328 --> 01:12:56.300
Who is most stable
psychologically is probably the

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:58.841
mother's mother,
the grandmother,

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:02.720
who will be 35 or 40 in a time
when you're sort of more or less

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:05.332
emotionally stable,
you haven't gotten into old age

01:13:05.332 --> 01:13:06.746
yet,
and whatever degree of economic

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:09.177
stability you're going to have,
which is never going to be very

01:13:09.177 --> 01:13:12.479
great,
is strongest at that age.

01:13:12.479 --> 01:13:16.637
In a sense, it's a very
rational kind of split that you

01:13:16.637 --> 01:13:18.408
do in your lifecycle.
 

01:13:18.408 --> 01:13:20.595
You do your biological
reproduction at the age when

01:13:20.595 --> 01:13:23.693
you're most capable of that,
and, at a later stage,

01:13:23.693 --> 01:13:28.130
when you're most psychically
and economically capable,

01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:31.220
you do your psychological and
economic parenting.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:35.381
There's also this and because
of that, there's been big

01:13:35.381 --> 01:13:38.078
debates in America about
welfare.

01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:41.917
Does welfare encourage
illegitimate births and they go

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:43.439
on the public dole.
 

01:13:43.439 --> 01:13:46.645
This is especially discussed,
either openly or covertly,

01:13:46.645 --> 01:13:50.319
always referring to poor people
and often to minority people.

01:13:50.319 --> 01:13:52.582
Well, if you actually look at
the economics,

01:13:52.582 --> 01:13:55.738
the amount that women get on
welfare is really very small.

01:13:55.738 --> 01:13:58.922
Where is the major--And not
enough to allow you to stay

01:13:58.922 --> 01:14:00.810
alive and bring up your child.
 

01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:03.198
Where is the economic
sustenance coming from?

01:14:03.198 --> 01:14:05.000
It's coming from the
grandmother.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.115
It's the grandmother,
the young girl and certainly

01:14:07.115 --> 01:14:09.189
the baby will often live with
the grandmother.

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:11.260
She pays the rent,
she has a job.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:13.920
The welfare is not coming from
the government,

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.340
that's a small amount.
 

01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.408
The welfare is coming from the
grandmother.

01:14:17.408 --> 01:14:22.332
There is welfare involved but
it's a within-the-family kind of

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.140
welfare.
 

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:27.622
It's really this system of
having the grandmother take care

01:14:27.622 --> 01:14:32.027
of the kids and economically
support the kids that is what

01:14:32.027 --> 01:14:36.432
enables a large degree of unwed
teen pregnancy in poor and

01:14:36.432 --> 01:14:38.520
minority communities.
 

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:43.668
Okay we will--from that lecture
we will go on to abortion next

01:14:43.668 --> 01:14:44.260
time.

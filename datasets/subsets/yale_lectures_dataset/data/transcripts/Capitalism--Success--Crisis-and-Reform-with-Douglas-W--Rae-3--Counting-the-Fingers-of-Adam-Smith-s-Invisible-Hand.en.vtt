00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:08.875
Prof: Since we are still
in the shopping period and some

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.018
turnover,
I thought it might be good if I

00:00:12.018 --> 00:00:15.177
spent the first three or four
minutes recapitulating from

00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:18.656
meeting one,
and then a little more on

00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:22.102
meeting two,
and then we'll feather that

00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:28.901
into today's topic,
which is the great work of

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:34.440
economics,
and the great--the greatest and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.680
most thoughtful normative tract
about markets and capitalism.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.387
I will--I'll begin,
as I said, with a

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:47.610
recapitulation.
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.024
Then we'll talk about some
basic components of Smith's

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:56.757
argument,
then I'll turn the slides off

00:00:56.757 --> 00:01:00.130
for awhile and we'll talk
informally,

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.593
and I'll include Jim Alexander
in the conversation about the

00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:12.400
way Smith and Smithism plays out
in today's world,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.111
and how it contradicts in many
respects what the great man

00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.420
actually said and meant to say.
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.840
Before meeting two, meeting one.
 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.426
Meeting one really just said
this: That the enormous surge in

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:40.793
human wealth over the past 250
years has a great deal to do

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:45.917
with capital,
with the intelligent use of

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:50.580
accumulated wealth in fresh
production.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.989
That capitalism is a subset of
the ways you can use capital,

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:06.218
even socialism uses capital,
even fascism uses capital,

00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:10.986
even squirrels and spiders in
some sense or another use

00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:11.870
capital.
 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.512
But capitalism is the
subspecies where wealth

00:02:16.512 --> 00:02:21.787
accumulated is deployed so as to
create new wealth,

00:02:21.787 --> 00:02:26.639
and to do so in a competitive
environment.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.305
And that second piece,
capitalism, was not invented by

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:39.068
some smart guy like Adam Smith,
but rather evolved organically

00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:45.410
by trial and error,
by experimentation, by failure.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.870
Indeed, if you look at a market
society, one of its great

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.330
features is that its history is
littered with failure.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.176
Learning to analyze past
success and past failure becomes

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:04.840
a key part of it.
 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.584
That's the--one last point,
and the "ism"

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:15.463
in capitalism is not something,
which originally was invented

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:18.938
by its friends,
by rather by its enemies.

00:03:18.938 --> 00:03:24.229
It was Marxism and other left
wing movements in the early and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:29.342
middle nineteenth century whence
the rhetoric of capitalism

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.490
appeared.
 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.022
Indeed the word had no
appearance whatever before that

00:03:36.022 --> 00:03:36.650
era.
 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:48.686
In meeting two we looked at the
kinetic structure of the world

00:03:48.686 --> 00:03:50.660
economy.
 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.580
With this Hans Rosling diagram
animated,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.758
it's still today,
but animated so that life

00:04:01.758 --> 00:04:08.127
expectancy and income per capita
could be seen moving dynamically

00:04:08.127 --> 00:04:14.354
across years,
we discovered that the typical

00:04:14.354 --> 00:04:20.269
story is a surge north in the
diagram,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.160
representing increased life
expectancy,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.139
with slow progress in income
per capita,

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.610
and then a surge around the
horn, so to speak,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.603
into the area upper right of
long lives and relative

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:39.779
affluence.
 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.600
And I asserted,
and many of you agreed,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.487
that there's something
unambiguously good about that

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:50.355
change,
that the world is a better

00:04:50.355 --> 00:04:53.269
place because that change
happened.

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:58.721
Now I didn't in the lecture lay
any great stress on the caveats

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.800
that people might attach to
that.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.639
One of them is that it was
accomplished,

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.363
in considerable measure,
through capital intensive

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:13.516
industry,
and highly capital intensive

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:16.629
forms of transportation.
 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.653
And that these were,
first of all,

00:05:19.653 --> 00:05:23.319
disruptive of the natural
environment.

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.930
There could be no doubt
whatever that the revolution in

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.439
the world economy left the
planet more fragile than it

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:35.790
found it.
 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:41.204
Indeed, poverty is a marvelous
environmental policy,

00:05:41.204 --> 00:05:46.726
because where there is no
demand there is very little

00:05:46.726 --> 00:05:48.319
disruption.
 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:57.690
Now we also looked at the world
demographic transition.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.829
The world demographic
transition, representing changes

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:07.403
in rates of birth and death,
death here in purple and birth

00:06:07.403 --> 00:06:10.961
in green,
and the old Malthusian world,

00:06:10.961 --> 00:06:16.012
which still exists on parts of
the globe but hasn't existed in

00:06:16.012 --> 00:06:20.319
the western world for a couple
of hundred years,

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:24.730
was characterized by very high
birthrates and very high death

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:25.319
rates.
 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.262
So you have essentially static
total population,

00:06:29.262 --> 00:06:32.449
and very few people lived to be
old.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:37.459
Then you have the change in the
death rate occasioned by

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:39.920
infrastructure,
most of all,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.379
related to clean water.
 

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:47.560
And when the death rate falls,
the birthrate doesn't track

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.470
with it.
 

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.079
The birthrate lags in its
change so there is a period,

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:56.995
Phase II here,
when deaths are falling sharply

00:06:56.995 --> 00:07:00.040
and births are statically high.
 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.880
In that period you get an
enormous surge,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.930
you get indeed population
growth at an increasing rate.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.603
You get the spike,
which brought world population

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:18.632
to its present level,
is occasioned largely by Phase

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:19.459
II.
 

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:28.271
Phase III is the period during
which the birthrate adjusts to

00:07:28.271 --> 00:07:30.769
the death rate.
 

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:33.898
You still get growing
population, but now at a

00:07:33.898 --> 00:07:35.220
diminishing rate.
 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.425
At Stage IV there's an
equilibrium between births and

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:44.029
deaths, and both have lower
rates.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:51.720
So population is again static,
and lives are much longer.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:59.779
Underneath that process,
and this I merely hinted in

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:05.163
meeting two,
is a surge in the supply of

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:11.971
labor, which occurs in Stages II
and III and creates a buyer's

00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:14.649
market for employers.
 

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:20.247
And by creating a buyer's
market for employers it drives

00:08:20.247 --> 00:08:21.569
down wages.
 

00:08:21.569 --> 00:08:26.774
Real wages are really quite low
during Phase II and Phase III in

00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:29.170
the history of the country.
 

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:35.970
Capital, which is only in part
related to demography,

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.440
it has an independent life of
its own,

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:42.860
but capital begins to
appreciate and be agglomerated

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:47.019
in large quantities only late in
this history.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:52.192
The places where you get huge
build up of capital are

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:58.360
typically places which are
beginning or well into Stage IV,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.960
and if you want to be precise
about it there is a Stage V,

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.166
which is where the birthrate
has actually fallen below the

00:09:07.166 --> 00:09:10.269
death rate,
so that, as with Japan,

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:13.469
Italy, Russia,
and much of Eastern Europe,

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:15.750
you have falling total
population.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.668
Now there is another aspect to
this that we'll pick up a month

00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:23.586
from now, which has to do with
the age profile of the existing

00:09:23.586 --> 00:09:24.548
population.
 

00:09:24.548 --> 00:09:28.403
You can yourself what
percentage of all the people in

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:30.850
the country are of working age?
 

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.230
You can figure from that a
so-called dependency ratio.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.754
How many people too old to work
and too young to work have to be

00:09:40.754 --> 00:09:44.918
supported by those who can work,
who are of working age?

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:50.629
And that ratio turns out to be
a big determinant of economic

00:09:50.629 --> 00:09:51.500
growth.
 

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.043
Whereas with China today,
Ireland in the very recent

00:09:58.043 --> 00:10:01.277
past,
you have a demographic sweet

00:10:01.277 --> 00:10:05.928
spot where there are relatively
few old and young people,

00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:08.610
and almost everybody is in the
working years.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:14.850
It's--that's a really low
resistance profile.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.908
And then at the other side,
the Japanese,

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:22.558
where the number of elderly
people who need to be supported

00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:27.288
is out of proportion to the size
of the actual workforce.

00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:35.528
Beneath this--these curves
related to capital and labor are

00:10:35.528 --> 00:10:42.629
just a few other things you want
to think about.

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:46.759
One is that you get much higher
incomes in Phase IV than in

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.970
earlier phases.
 

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:51.200
It's partly because of capital
concentration,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:57.889
but it's also because human
capital in the form of trained

00:10:57.889 --> 00:11:01.014
ability,
educated people,

00:11:01.014 --> 00:11:08.580
it becomes much easier to build
a massive educational apparatus,

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.658
a formal apparatus,
and also an applied apparatus

00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:17.335
in the workforce where in 40
years of working in a given

00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:22.570
trade,
people get really good at it.

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:27.259
So that--that's another way in
which the later stages of the

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:32.028
world demographic transition are
profitable, quite literally,

00:11:32.028 --> 00:11:33.379
to a country.
 

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:38.350
Inequality tends to be highest
in the emerging markets,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:43.139
because typically what you get
is a mass of very poor people,

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:47.793
and relatively small elite,
which has found its way into

00:11:47.793 --> 00:11:49.908
capitalist development.
 

00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:53.413
Labor abundant,
capital scarce,

00:11:53.413 --> 00:11:56.100
we talked about that.
 

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:04.440
Insourcing and outsourcing,
this is a very obvious point;

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.488
Stage IV countries outsource
tasks to Stage II and III

00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:13.490
countries because labor is much
cheaper.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:20.740
The obverse of that is
insourcing at the other end.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.864
And the main movement in Stage
II and III countries actually

00:12:24.864 --> 00:12:27.659
has two parts:
One is from countryside to

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:30.684
city,
because the opportunities of

00:12:30.684 --> 00:12:35.418
capital intensive enterprise are
concentrated in cities;

00:12:35.418 --> 00:12:41.202
and from an out of Stage II and
II countries into Stage IV

00:12:41.202 --> 00:12:42.418
countries.
 

00:12:42.418 --> 00:12:47.384
This is a classic pattern,
which is highly visible today

00:12:47.384 --> 00:12:52.890
with the borders of the United
States and Europe being crowded

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.779
and not entirely controlled.
 

00:12:55.779 --> 00:12:59.120
And it was the same story 100
years ago,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.890
when southern and Eastern
Europe were in Stage III and the

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:10.663
United States was approaching
Stage IV and immigration was

00:13:10.663 --> 00:13:11.980
enormous.
 

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:14.114
My own family,
on my father's side,

00:13:14.114 --> 00:13:17.190
were immigrants in the early
twentieth century.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.298
Okay, so Smith's invisible hand.
 

00:13:22.298 --> 00:13:31.899
The question is:
If its invisible how can we

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:35.918
know it's there?
 

00:13:35.918 --> 00:13:41.481
There are various--there are
several good New Yorker

00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:44.360
cartoons about that problem.
 

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.854
One shows a group of
well-dressed people gathered in

00:13:47.854 --> 00:13:52.033
a farm field Darien Connecticut
looking out with binoculars to

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:55.318
find the invisible hand,
which has been reported to have

00:13:55.318 --> 00:13:55.990
appeared there.
 

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:01.149
Another is a store with a sign
across the front,

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:03.591
"Store closing,"
and then a caption under the

00:14:03.591 --> 00:14:05.988
"store closing"
sign: "Bitch-slapped by

00:14:05.988 --> 00:14:07.298
the invisible hand."
 

00:14:07.298 --> 00:14:22.883
The condition under which the
invisible hand works is

00:14:22.883 --> 00:14:27.895
actually--
there are several things that

00:14:27.895 --> 00:14:30.581
have to be there for it to
happen and let's just kind of

00:14:30.581 --> 00:14:31.509
inventory those.
 

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:36.860
First is, you have to have an
open market.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.734
It has to be a market where
people can come in and begin to

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:43.538
produce, or arrive and begin to
consume.

00:14:43.538 --> 00:14:47.169
If it is regulated,
for example,

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:53.610
by tariffs or by a mafia,
then that is the visible hand,

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:59.700
and the invisible hand is
blocked from its work.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:06.548
There needs to be no seller big
enough to drive down--to control

00:15:06.548 --> 00:15:10.678
prices by, say,
withholding product.

00:15:10.678 --> 00:15:17.778
There needs,
third, to be no buyer--I've

00:15:17.778 --> 00:15:29.610
left out a step--no seller and
no buyer able to control prices.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:34.051
What would make that--what kind
of distribution of production

00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:37.159
and buying would be required to
do that?

00:15:37.159 --> 00:15:41.570
Somebody near a mic.
 

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:50.409
Got a mic?
 

00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:51.480
Student:  A monopoly.
 

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.153
Prof: A--
Student:  A monopsony

00:15:55.153 --> 00:15:55.870
and a monopoly.
 

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:57.538
Prof: Okay,
those are the things you don't

00:15:57.538 --> 00:15:59.032
want if you want the invisible
hand to work,

00:15:59.032 --> 00:15:59.379
right?
 

00:15:59.379 --> 00:16:02.058
What you want is somebody else?
 

00:16:02.058 --> 00:16:04.840
Student:  Perfect
competition.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.940
Prof: Yes?
 

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.620
Student:  Perfect
competition.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.932
Prof: Okay,
and perfect competition occurs

00:16:08.932 --> 00:16:09.259
when what?
 

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:12.384
Student:  When no buyer
is big enough to control the

00:16:12.384 --> 00:16:12.870
market.
 

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.960
Prof: Okay,
but that's circular.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.558
So we need to put one step in
between there.

00:16:18.558 --> 00:16:20.418
Student:  When prices
are independent.

00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:22.538
So the market itself sets the
price.

00:16:22.538 --> 00:16:26.240
Prof: Well let's work at
this.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:31.861
I showed a picture when I
started this of a wheat field

00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:38.110
and I didn't show a picture of a
car factory or Microsoft.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:42.740
The key fact is that you have a
fine grain division of

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.283
production and consumption so
there are thousands and

00:16:47.283 --> 00:16:51.111
thousands of producers,
thousands and thousands of

00:16:51.111 --> 00:16:54.505
consumers,
no one of them big enough to

00:16:54.505 --> 00:16:56.178
game the market.
 

00:16:56.178 --> 00:17:01.366
If you're making--if you're
producing wheat or rice,

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:05.435
and you say,
"The world price is too

00:17:05.435 --> 00:17:06.250
low.
 

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:10.336
I'm going to drive it up by
withholding this year's crop

00:17:10.336 --> 00:17:13.308
from my 100 acres,"
that's like,

00:17:13.308 --> 00:17:16.981
"Hit my hand,"
because you have no market

00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:17.568
power.
 

00:17:17.568 --> 00:17:21.730
No producer holds a pivotal
private technology.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:30.210
And it's pretty obvious what's
meant by that;

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.102
a patented technology,
or a trade secret which allows

00:17:34.102 --> 00:17:38.144
one producer to differentiate
him or herself from other

00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:40.990
producers and dominate the
market.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.960
There are the buyers.
 

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.663
And perfect information,
more or less truthful

00:17:48.663 --> 00:17:54.204
information across the whole
market, and government to

00:17:54.204 --> 00:17:57.759
enforce property and contract.
 

00:17:57.759 --> 00:18:04.488
So with all those conditions in
place, what Smith says about the

00:18:04.488 --> 00:18:07.798
invisible hand is,
more or less,

00:18:07.798 --> 00:18:08.759
true.
 

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:12.700
Let's see if I can find the
quote.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:22.390
He talks about producers who
are in this,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.394
"And many other cases,
led by an invisible hand to

00:18:25.394 --> 00:18:28.792
promote the end,
which they have no part of in

00:18:28.792 --> 00:18:29.608
intention.
 

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:34.301
By pursuing his own interest,
he frequently promotes that of

00:18:34.301 --> 00:18:38.596
society more effectually than
when he really intends to

00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:39.788
promote it.
 

00:18:39.788 --> 00:18:43.582
I have never known much good to
come from people trading in the

00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:45.538
name of the public good."
 

00:18:45.538 --> 00:18:51.884
The--on both the producer and
the consumer side,

00:18:51.884 --> 00:18:56.608
there is a peculiar power
vacuum.

00:18:56.608 --> 00:19:01.617
There is no one who can be said
to have set the price of the

00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:04.420
good or determined its quality.
 

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:10.153
It is decided collectively,
and the Smithian idea there is

00:19:10.153 --> 00:19:16.490
actually the idea of general
equilibrium in a market economy.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.598
The next phase of economic
theory,

00:19:18.598 --> 00:19:22.638
neoclassical economics,
formalizes this idea and makes

00:19:22.638 --> 00:19:26.686
it mathematically precise,
and we'll look at it in a

00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:30.316
little while,
but here it's important,

00:19:30.316 --> 00:19:36.737
first, just to get the context
in which Smith writes about the

00:19:36.737 --> 00:19:42.000
invisible hand in The Wealth
of Nations.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.473
Anybody able to provide us with
the exact point he's trying to

00:19:45.473 --> 00:19:45.930
prove?
 

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:56.798
Is there a hand somewhere?
 

00:19:56.798 --> 00:20:02.190
You're trying to set this guy
up, I know that.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.359
Was there?
 

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:06.079
Wave it please.
 

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:11.828
Yes, you need the mic.
 

00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:14.910
Come on, guys,
we got to manage the mic

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:15.640
better.
 

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.720
Where is it?
 

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.650
Student:
&gt;

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:22.318
Prof: Just--it doesn't
work without the mic.

00:20:22.318 --> 00:20:29.203
Would one of you guys,
just, kind of,

00:20:29.203 --> 00:20:36.279
stay standing and get it to
people?

00:20:36.279 --> 00:20:37.068
Student: 
&gt;

00:20:37.068 --> 00:20:38.460
point that nations shouldn't
impose tariffs.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.859
Prof: Okay,
he's arguing against tariffs

00:20:41.859 --> 00:20:43.930
and for free trade,
right?

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:49.500
And why do--why is that an
argumentative point for him?

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:50.880
Why are there tariffs?
 

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:53.603
Student:  Because the
nations thought that they were

00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:55.387
protecting their economies by
enforcing

00:20:55.387 --> 00:20:56.750
&gt;
 

00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:58.818
Prof: Okay,
and who were they helping to

00:20:58.818 --> 00:21:00.933
reach that--who helped the
nations to reach that

00:21:00.933 --> 00:21:01.608
conclusion?
 

00:21:01.608 --> 00:21:04.338
Student:  Other
economists?

00:21:04.338 --> 00:21:07.750
Prof: Well,
yeah, sort of.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.818
I'm fishing for something a
little different.

00:21:09.818 --> 00:21:12.930
Let's pass the mic over to--is
it "The violin

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.009
question?"
 

00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:18.140
"The viola question;"
okay, my wife is a violist.

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:20.304
Student:  Well,
I guess the predominant

00:21:20.304 --> 00:21:23.286
economic philosophy at the time
when Adam Smith was writing was

00:21:23.286 --> 00:21:25.650
mercantilism--
Prof: Mercantilism, yes.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.818
Student: 
&gt;

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:28.748
mercantilism,
which is, you know,

00:21:28.748 --> 00:21:29.848
accumulate as much gold as
possible;

00:21:29.848 --> 00:21:31.963
become the richest,
you know, individual through

00:21:31.963 --> 00:21:33.435
that regard,
which means,

00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.960
you know, not really importing
much,

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:39.720
and thus, really focusing on
supporting domestic development.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.660
Prof: Okay,
good, that's excellent.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.329
Smith was anti-mercantilist.
 

00:21:44.329 --> 00:21:46.470
He was a free trader.
 

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:51.665
And the people who had a
concrete interest in tariff

00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:57.779
imposition--who would have a
strong self interest in that?

00:21:57.779 --> 00:21:59.298
Let's get the mic over here.
 

00:21:59.298 --> 00:22:02.712
I think one of you TAs really
needs to just stand up and MC

00:22:02.712 --> 00:22:03.420
the thing.
 

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.210
Student:  Domestic
merchants and manufacturers.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:09.082
Prof: Well,
certainly manufacturers,

00:22:09.082 --> 00:22:09.630
right?
 

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:13.219
Domestic manufacturers,
who are in some way or another,

00:22:13.219 --> 00:22:15.278
not competitive with imports.
 

00:22:15.278 --> 00:22:19.809
And Smith has this wonderful
passage, I think it's near this,

00:22:19.809 --> 00:22:23.357
where he talks about how you
could, in Scotland,

00:22:23.357 --> 00:22:25.019
produce good wine.
 

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:29.794
You'd have to have hot houses
and many other special and very

00:22:29.794 --> 00:22:34.652
expensive accoutrements.
But for about thirty times the

00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:37.809
price--the production price of
France, Spain,

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:41.038
or Italy, you could produce
Scottish wine.

00:22:41.038 --> 00:22:46.411
But it would be a foolish
betrayal of the public interest

00:22:46.411 --> 00:22:51.782
to put up a tariff so that you
could then sell that wine,

00:22:51.782 --> 00:22:53.990
worth $2, for $200.
 

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:58.058
And that's the center of his
argument, right.

00:22:58.058 --> 00:23:02.357
He begins at the micro level
with the butcher,

00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:07.708
the baker, and the brewer,
which is a metaphor that rings

00:23:07.708 --> 00:23:10.670
true for most of us,
right?

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:16.200
Why is the produce fresh in the
little market on Orange Street

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.558
in New Haven?
 

00:23:17.558 --> 00:23:22.308
The main reason is because
there are two little markets in

00:23:22.308 --> 00:23:23.308
New Haven.
 

00:23:23.308 --> 00:23:27.199
If it were just one,
thirty-six hour old lettuce

00:23:27.199 --> 00:23:29.019
would be marketable.
 

00:23:29.019 --> 00:23:32.194
But with two,
one of whom drives to New York

00:23:32.194 --> 00:23:35.740
every morning at 3:00,
that just doesn't work.

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:42.439
So that Smith talks about the
self-interest axiom as the

00:23:42.439 --> 00:23:47.190
driver for promoting the common
good.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:52.538
Now I'm going to invite Jim
Alexander to come on up and

00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:57.690
we'll just stand and--let's
actually sit and talk.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:04.167
Some of you have been
introduced to Jim Alexander,

00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:09.588
and for others,
I'll introduce him now.

00:24:09.588 --> 00:24:14.877
Jim is a good friend,
and was--had a twenty year

00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:21.378
career in investment banking,
and after that a stint as Chief

00:24:21.378 --> 00:24:25.493
Financial Officer of Enron
Global Power &amp;

00:24:25.493 --> 00:24:29.628
Pipeline,
which was indeed one of the

00:24:29.628 --> 00:24:34.279
famous partnerships in the Enron
meltdown.

00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:41.013
He was a straight shooter;
as the best book on the Enron

00:24:41.013 --> 00:24:45.602
meltdown calls him,
the "fly in the

00:24:45.602 --> 00:24:49.584
ointment,"
and went off to co-found

00:24:49.584 --> 00:24:53.957
Spinnaker Exploration,
which later became a public

00:24:53.957 --> 00:24:54.529
company.
 

00:24:54.529 --> 00:25:01.176
Jim is going to be part of this
course from time to time and I

00:25:01.176 --> 00:25:06.873
thought maybe,
to bring the discussion down

00:25:06.873 --> 00:25:11.730
from the clouds here,
I would ask Jim:

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:17.147
Is the ghost of Adam Smith
alive in the boardroom in

00:25:17.147 --> 00:25:19.380
corporate America?
 

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.906
Jim Alexander:
 Well, the self-image of

00:25:24.906 --> 00:25:27.608
Adam Smith is alive.
 

00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:31.940
The ideology that would be
espoused is that of Adam Smith.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.936
The substance is not there,
I believe, but most of the

00:25:36.936 --> 00:25:42.406
people would pass the polygraph
test that they believe it's

00:25:42.406 --> 00:25:43.349
there.
 

00:25:43.349 --> 00:25:45.230
Prof: Okay, that's good.
 

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.670
Now let's--here's an
interesting exercise.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.730
There are about a dozen MBAs in
the group here.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:26:01.890
Every MBA--every MBA period,
has learned the Porter Forces.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:05.710
What are the Porter Forces?
 

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:09.943
The Porter Forces are the rules
of thumb you need to make above

00:26:09.943 --> 00:26:12.130
average profits within a firm.
 

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.075
One of them is:
You don't want too much

00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:17.710
competition--direct competition.
 

00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.250
Direct competition erodes
profits.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.519
You want high barriers to entry.
 

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:28.611
You don't want powerful buyers
who can drive down your price

00:26:28.611 --> 00:26:30.509
through negotiating.
 

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:33.340
For example,
tire companies face very

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:36.960
powerful buyers in automobile
manufacturers.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.818
You want to avoid situations
like that.

00:26:39.818 --> 00:26:43.779
You also want to be able to
control your suppliers so they

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:47.880
can't see you making profits and
then demand their share.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.430
Now just think for a second.
 

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.997
How do the Porter Forces align
with the conditions that I

00:26:54.997 --> 00:26:58.756
sketched five minutes ago for
the operation of the invisible

00:26:58.756 --> 00:26:59.328
hand?
 

00:26:59.328 --> 00:27:03.644
In the back,
you've got to be really loud

00:27:03.644 --> 00:27:06.730
because the--
Student:  They're the

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:07.509
exact opposite.
 

00:27:07.509 --> 00:27:10.730
Prof: They are
essentially the exact opposite.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:16.265
The name in business speak for
operating under the control of

00:27:16.265 --> 00:27:20.970
the invisible hand is
"commodity hell."

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:26.582
Commodity hell being that
you're producing something which

00:27:26.582 --> 00:27:30.618
thousands of other people can
produce,

00:27:30.618 --> 00:27:33.509
and they can produce it as
cheaply and as well as you can,

00:27:33.509 --> 00:27:39.170
and so the available pricing
strategies to you are--

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.118
none of them involve high
profits.

00:27:41.118 --> 00:27:47.730
One of the fundamental axioms
of business management--

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.950
and I'm not making a moral
condemnation,

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.134
I'm just making an observation
that there is a strong tension

00:27:53.134 --> 00:27:57.861
here--
that the pursuit of actual--the

00:27:57.861 --> 00:28:03.690
actual submission to the
invisible hand--

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:10.250
is contrary to the very basis
of corporate strategy.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:18.306
Jim, talk a little from your
experience about the intelligent

00:28:18.306 --> 00:28:25.423
use of the Porter Forces by
management strategists--or

00:28:25.423 --> 00:28:27.838
unintelligent.
 

00:28:27.838 --> 00:28:30.660
Jim Alexander:
 Well from the latter--

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.402
but basically no one ever wants
to get into an Adam Smith type

00:28:34.402 --> 00:28:36.291
of market,
and if you're in it,

00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:37.329
you get out of it.
 

00:28:37.329 --> 00:28:40.259
Because there's--it's ruinous.
 

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:49.131
And the only way you can affect
change in that type of market is

00:28:49.131 --> 00:28:56.154
to do what Adam Smith suggested,
and that is make some sort of

00:28:56.154 --> 00:29:01.290
national security argument why--
in fact, while Smith's views

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.828
are very well and fine in
general,

00:29:04.828 --> 00:29:08.220
you need, and the country more
especially needs,

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:14.170
to have defense against foreign
imports or ruinous competition.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.916
I think the sugar producers
were able to pull that off

00:29:16.916 --> 00:29:19.923
pretty neatly and can make a
national security argument for

00:29:19.923 --> 00:29:24.478
it for sugar quotas,
but you never tolerate an Adam

00:29:24.478 --> 00:29:27.519
Smith level of competition.
 

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:30.608
Prof: Okay,
and if you look at--

00:29:30.608 --> 00:29:34.150
I ordered Thank You For
Smoking,

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:37.509
Christopher Buckley's book,
as an option for this course,

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:40.549
but I'm told all of you have
seen the movie,

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:42.170
which I haven't.
 

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:44.480
Is the movie any good?
 

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.828
Student:  Yes.
 

00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:47.336
Prof: Okay,
you should all look at the

00:29:47.336 --> 00:29:47.608
movie.
 

00:29:47.608 --> 00:29:53.269
And the book is all about the
way corporations,

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:56.200
including those which make,
in this case,

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.951
cigarettes, booze,
and firearms,

00:29:58.951 --> 00:30:03.461
but mostly cigarettes,
have elaborate representation

00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:08.440
in Washington and promote their
own interests through the law.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:09.848
It's not a big surprise.
 

00:30:09.848 --> 00:30:17.172
But the tension between the
idealized theory of the market

00:30:17.172 --> 00:30:22.440
and that practice is a very
strong one.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.070
Incidentally,
Smith was very critical of the

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.990
corporations,
which existed in his time,

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:35.323
and he was critical of them for
partly the reason we just

00:30:35.323 --> 00:30:41.883
articulated: That they can
control pricing and impose their

00:30:41.883 --> 00:30:45.048
product by that method.
 

00:30:45.048 --> 00:30:48.531
But more, Smith thought,
that the people running the

00:30:48.531 --> 00:30:51.536
corporations,
which existed at that time were

00:30:51.536 --> 00:30:53.380
thoroughly incompetent.
 

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:56.577
And that's, of course,
because the Yale School of

00:30:56.577 --> 00:30:59.108
Management had not yet been
founded.

00:30:59.108 --> 00:31:03.637
In actual fact there is a
fundamental problem about

00:31:03.637 --> 00:31:07.532
corporations and their
management called the

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:10.160
principal-agency problem.
 

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:16.078
The gist of that problem is
that managers,

00:31:16.078 --> 00:31:21.703
left to their own devices,
will tend to take a company

00:31:21.703 --> 00:31:24.443
where--
in a direction which is best

00:31:24.443 --> 00:31:28.204
for them individually and not
necessarily for the broad body

00:31:28.204 --> 00:31:32.692
of shareholders,
and so the control over that

00:31:32.692 --> 00:31:38.888
tendency gets to be one of the
major dramatic themes in

00:31:38.888 --> 00:31:40.838
business life.
 

00:31:40.838 --> 00:31:46.365
Jim you've been near some
management, which had rent

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:48.640
seeking tendencies.
 

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.596
Jim Alexander:
 Well, let me come back to

00:31:51.596 --> 00:31:56.046
something else,
and that is that at least one

00:31:56.046 --> 00:32:02.450
of the sections Smith has
revolves around the butcher,

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:07.098
the brewer, and the baker,
and how it's much more reliable

00:32:07.098 --> 00:32:11.750
to rely on their self interest
than their benevolence,

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:14.358
which is true.
 

00:32:14.358 --> 00:32:17.727
There is--I think there is an
embedded assumption which he

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:20.490
doesn't go into,
and that is:

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:26.575
he cites examples of what are--
at least at the time,

00:32:26.575 --> 00:32:31.125
where a single proprietor sort
of business is marketing a

00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:35.836
product which was directly
consumed by individuals who knew

00:32:35.836 --> 00:32:39.950
the proprietors well,
and understood what good meat

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:42.068
was from meat that wasn't good.
 

00:32:42.068 --> 00:32:50.828
And that also is increasingly
irrelevant since his time,

00:32:50.828 --> 00:32:53.930
because one of the most
important things,

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:57.241
I thought, in one of your
slides, was that there be

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.700
perfect information.
 

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:01.853
And on top of that,
an embedded assumption there is

00:33:01.853 --> 00:33:04.942
that there has to be perfect
information perfectly

00:33:04.942 --> 00:33:05.890
understood.
 

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:07.660
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.608
Jim Alexander:
 In fact one of the--

00:33:09.608 --> 00:33:13.795
and having come from finance,
it's sort of the highest form

00:33:13.795 --> 00:33:17.762
of art is to have information
which in retrospect can be

00:33:17.762 --> 00:33:21.698
defended as reliable,
but prospectively is virtually

00:33:21.698 --> 00:33:22.588
meaningless.
 

00:33:22.588 --> 00:33:27.226
One of the ways we can--that it
really becomes very important in

00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:29.932
practice,
forget about Smithian ideals,

00:33:29.932 --> 00:33:33.328
is to make sure that you have
colorable information,

00:33:33.328 --> 00:33:36.855
colorable voluntary
transactions,

00:33:36.855 --> 00:33:41.233
but in fact,
they are, practically speaking,

00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:44.426
not voluntary,
and, practically speaking,

00:33:44.426 --> 00:33:45.390
not informed.
 

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:49.670
On top of that you start having
principal-agent issues.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.720
Let's take the butcher,
for example,

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.368
one butcher in a little village
deals with people he knows,

00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:00.528
so there's social constraints,
and there's also--

00:34:00.528 --> 00:34:02.170
it's fairly easy if it's one
butcher,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:06.460
to trace any illnesses that
result.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:10.253
And he has a relatively
unmarketable asset,

00:34:10.253 --> 00:34:14.949
which is his interest in his
private butcher shop;

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:18.744
very hard to sell,
so he must count on long term

00:34:18.744 --> 00:34:23.469
profit maximization;
not short term, but long term.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:28.168
Now let's imagine that you had
a--I don't think (inaudible)

00:34:28.168 --> 00:34:32.949
processer is public at this
point but let's imagine that you

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:37.650
had a butcher business which was
owned by the public,

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.539
controlled by a small group of
managers.

00:34:39.539 --> 00:34:43.333
And furthermore let's assume,
and it's actually a pretty good

00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:45.726
assumption,
that you had a group of

00:34:45.726 --> 00:34:49.525
semi-knowledgeable mutual fund
managers who rewarded people

00:34:49.525 --> 00:34:53.389
with huge gains in their share
value if they were able,

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:57.871
reliably, to hit their
quarterly earnings estimate and

00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:00.275
punish them,
of course, if anything went

00:35:00.275 --> 00:35:00.570
wrong.
 

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:04.061
Under those circumstances,
assuming that the investing

00:35:04.061 --> 00:35:08.280
public really didn't understand
the dynamics of the business,

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:14.139
and assuming that you could
make satisfactory short term

00:35:14.139 --> 00:35:17.344
goals,
maybe making 100 times the

00:35:17.344 --> 00:35:22.349
average income of the typical
worker every couple weeks,

00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:27.268
then you would be incentivized,
unless you were very risk

00:35:27.268 --> 00:35:29.432
adverse to,
for example,

00:35:29.432 --> 00:35:34.019
being able to buy tainted meat
and then be able to make some

00:35:34.019 --> 00:35:36.534
extra pennies,
beat your numbers,

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.639
get a big upgrade in your
stock,

00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:41.219
if you have a lot of options
you have a very highly leveraged

00:35:41.219 --> 00:35:43.853
wealth situation,
then make enough money in the

00:35:43.853 --> 00:35:46.889
short term,
where you could live--maybe buy

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.155
a small country or live with
gravy for the rest of your life

00:35:51.155 --> 00:35:54.552
on a basis which was
sufficiently confusing that

00:35:54.552 --> 00:35:57.300
you're unlikely to be
prosecuted.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:59.940
That's my experience as to how
it works.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.456
I realize that it's a small
sliver and it is oriented toward

00:36:04.456 --> 00:36:06.871
finance,
which is the worst part of

00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:09.889
American business,
but that's in fact how I've

00:36:09.889 --> 00:36:10.829
seen it work.
 

00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:13.429
No theories,
it's just how it works,

00:36:13.429 --> 00:36:16.766
so people believe,
and yet the same people who

00:36:16.766 --> 00:36:21.289
would do this would spout and
believe every bit of it the same

00:36:21.289 --> 00:36:25.960
type of Smithian idealism you
see here: the invisible hand.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.643
My experience is that the
invisible hand typically is

00:36:28.643 --> 00:36:31.070
picking someone's pocket,
not creating value.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:36.143
And in fact,
the last--I remember talking to

00:36:36.143 --> 00:36:43.103
the senior Republic staffer at
The House Energy and Commerce

00:36:43.103 --> 00:36:47.273
Committee and making--
Prof: Jim is,

00:36:47.273 --> 00:36:49.440
by the way, I believe you are a
Republican.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.989
Jim Alexander:
 Used to be.

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:52.190
Prof: Okay.
 

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:53.349
Jim Alexander:
 Used to be;

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:55.539
this is kind of why I used to
be.

00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:58.664
I'm up talking to the lead
Republican staffer at The House

00:36:58.664 --> 00:37:01.789
Energy and Commerce Committee
and saying at one point that

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:04.530
capitalism justifies itself by
creating real,

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:05.949
not illusory, value.
 

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:08.173
To which he replied,
"Well you're nothing but a

00:37:08.173 --> 00:37:08.960
communist."
 

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.570
That, in fact, is the problem.
 

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:17.849
Under Smithian assumptions
about long-term honesty,

00:37:17.849 --> 00:37:21.445
long-term interests in real
value creation,

00:37:21.445 --> 00:37:23.500
it worked perfectly.
 

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.244
It's just that when those
assumptions start to erode,

00:37:27.244 --> 00:37:29.260
it turns into a nightmare.
 

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.139
Prof: Okay terrific.
 

00:37:32.139 --> 00:37:34.804
Georgios, I'm going to call on
you in a moment for a one

00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:35.579
sentence read.
 

00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:39.079
Here's the proposition that we
now want to look at.

00:37:39.079 --> 00:37:44.510
Smith--here's an apparent but
not real paradox.

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:50.190
Adam Smith says self-interest
is the main motive for what

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.320
people actually do.
 

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:57.050
And yet, he led a life,
which didn't begin to maximize

00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:59.639
his own material interests.
 

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:04.449
He lived modestly,
he worked diligently,

00:38:04.449 --> 00:38:13.032
and he never became a wealthy
man, so if he believed it for

00:38:13.032 --> 00:38:16.585
mankind,
how come he didn't practice it

00:38:16.585 --> 00:38:17.420
for himself?
 

00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:21.313
Well, Richard--
Student:  I just wanted

00:38:21.313 --> 00:38:24.579
to add I think it's probably the
way you define self-interest.

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:27.659
Self-interest to one person may
not be the same to another,

00:38:27.659 --> 00:38:31.889
so while you just associate it
with wealth and material goods,

00:38:31.889 --> 00:38:34.070
to someone else it's not
necessarily someone else's

00:38:34.070 --> 00:38:35.380
definition of self interest.
 

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:37.150
Prof: Fair enough,
that's a good point.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.659
The other side of it is that
Wealth of Nations was

00:38:40.659 --> 00:38:43.666
Smith's second main book,
and it wasn't the book,

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:46.550
which made him famous in his
own lifetime.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.231
The Theory of Moral
Sentiments is the book,

00:38:49.231 --> 00:38:51.639
which made him famous in his
own lifetime.

00:38:51.639 --> 00:38:54.960
And Georgios,
will you read us,

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:01.378
please, in good strong voice,
the first sentence of Smith's

00:39:01.378 --> 00:39:03.039
first book?
 

00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:14.179
Thanks very much Leslie.
 

00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:16.367
Student:  "How
selfish, so ever,

00:39:16.367 --> 00:39:18.605
man may be supposed,
there are evidently some

00:39:18.605 --> 00:39:21.657
principles in his nature which
interest him in the fortune of

00:39:21.657 --> 00:39:24.512
others,
and render their happiness

00:39:24.512 --> 00:39:27.362
necessary to him,
though he derives nothing from

00:39:27.362 --> 00:39:29.199
it except the pleasure of seeing
it."

00:39:29.199 --> 00:39:32.130
Prof: Okay,
now read it one more time.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.909
Student:  "How
selfish,

00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:37.585
so ever, man may be supposed,
there are evidently some

00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:41.746
principles in his nature which
interest him in the fortune of

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:44.231
others,
and render their happiness

00:39:44.231 --> 00:39:47.349
necessary to him,
though he derives nothing from

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:50.090
it except the pleasure of seeing
it."

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:54.179
Prof: Okay,
so Smith actually believed that

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:58.518
we were a complicated mix,
and I think he's right.

00:39:58.518 --> 00:40:02.963
He believed that there is a
pro-social element in almost

00:40:02.963 --> 00:40:04.579
every human being.
 

00:40:04.579 --> 00:40:10.059
There is an innate sympathy for
others, which almost everyone

00:40:10.059 --> 00:40:15.266
has, and at the same time,
a tendency to feather one's own

00:40:15.266 --> 00:40:16.090
nest.
 

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.730
Now I don't know anyone who is
just one of those two things.

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:25.380
I don't know anyone who is a
pure egotist.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:27.719
Jim Alexander:  Me.
 

00:40:27.719 --> 00:40:29.440
Prof: You do?
 

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:36.427
My goodness;
not even generous to his aged

00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:39.385
mother or--
Jim Alexander:

00:40:39.385 --> 00:40:40.579
 What's she done for him?
 

00:40:40.579 --> 00:40:44.914
Prof: Okay,
well there may be some but

00:40:44.914 --> 00:40:47.969
there aren't a hell of a lot.
 

00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:51.940
Smith--this is characteristic
of Smith--Smith is not a

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:52.840
dogmatist.
 

00:40:52.840 --> 00:41:00.467
Smith is a careful observer who
draws as much from the evidence

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:02.190
as is there.
 

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:07.971
Now this is a map which links
Smith forward to the next

00:41:07.971 --> 00:41:14.099
historical period,
namely the period when world

00:41:14.099 --> 00:41:18.159
trade got serious,
and the period,

00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:21.768
which we will discuss in
Monday's class,

00:41:21.768 --> 00:41:24.467
when Marx and Engels were
writing The Communist

00:41:24.467 --> 00:41:25.349
Manifesto.
 

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:30.650
The picture on the board is the
world railroad grid,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:36.097
and if you think about Smith's
story about how wealth depends

00:41:36.097 --> 00:41:40.353
on the division of labor,
it works only where you have a

00:41:40.353 --> 00:41:43.389
large market,
and he makes that point at

00:41:43.389 --> 00:41:44.059
length.
 

00:41:44.059 --> 00:41:47.503
In the period,
which begins in the middle

00:41:47.503 --> 00:41:50.739
1800s,
it really begins about 1840,

00:41:50.739 --> 00:41:55.574
in that period really large
markets became accessible to

00:41:55.574 --> 00:42:01.199
everyone located in the dense
part of the world railway grid.

00:42:01.199 --> 00:42:06.726
And toward the end of the
semester, we'll be dealing with

00:42:06.726 --> 00:42:11.563
the problem of economic
development in places like

00:42:11.563 --> 00:42:12.550
these.
 

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:18.144
If you look at the way the
railroads developed there,

00:42:18.144 --> 00:42:24.170
they all developed to reach
ocean ports for the export of

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:27.400
products to world markets.
 

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:31.989
The density of connection
required for the internal

00:42:31.989 --> 00:42:37.130
development of large markets was
by and large missing.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:44.481
Okay, now--I think I'll just
finish with Adam Smith's story

00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:50.186
about the pin making,
and what happened in the

00:42:50.186 --> 00:42:52.849
pin-making story.
 

00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:56.507
I actually didn't have you read
this because it's something

00:42:56.507 --> 00:43:00.420
everybody--I think everybody
learns this one in high school.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:05.413
The division of labor for Smith
is illustrated by a group of

00:43:05.413 --> 00:43:07.360
artisans making pins.
 

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:14.150
One person gets really good at
drawing the wire out straight,

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.630
another person at hammering a
head onto the wire,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.210
another person at making the
point sharp,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.360
another person at polishing the
shaft.

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:27.440
And by division of labor and
development of expertise,

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:31.173
they can produce more pins of
higher quality than a single

00:43:31.173 --> 00:43:34.711
artisan doing each of those
operations by himself could

00:43:34.711 --> 00:43:36.219
possibly have done.
 

00:43:36.219 --> 00:43:39.849
It's a good illustration.
 

00:43:39.849 --> 00:43:44.925
And if you think about all the
professions and occupations in

00:43:44.925 --> 00:43:48.635
an economy,
that kind of profiting--that

00:43:48.635 --> 00:43:52.693
way of profiting from
specialized expertise is

00:43:52.693 --> 00:43:56.030
foundational to market
societies,

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:58.239
foundational to their wealth.
 

00:43:58.239 --> 00:44:02.708
Now the actual fate of the pin
machine is interesting,

00:44:02.708 --> 00:44:05.070
and personal to my family.
 

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:11.519
It turns out that in 1831,
a New York physician named John

00:44:11.519 --> 00:44:17.518
Ireland Howe began to tinker
with the idea of making a

00:44:17.518 --> 00:44:24.309
machine where wire went in one
end and polished pins came out

00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:28.268
the other in their thousands.
 

00:44:28.268 --> 00:44:33.219
By 1851 he perfected what was
called the Howe Pin Machine.

00:44:33.219 --> 00:44:37.079
There's a room in the
Smithsonian to this day where a

00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:41.309
Howe Pin Machine sits and a
movie of its operation goes on

00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:42.349
behind it.
 

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:44.759
Well John Ireland Howe,
I won't brag again in this

00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:47.268
semester,
was my five over great

00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:50.500
grandfather,
and the family began pissing

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.414
away the money right away,
and completed the task just in

00:44:54.414 --> 00:44:55.619
time for my birth.
 

00:44:55.619 --> 00:45:02.389
The slides include a
formalization of equilibrium

00:45:02.389 --> 00:45:10.289
theory with an Edgeworth box and
indifference curves,

00:45:10.289 --> 00:45:12.425
and all that,
but I don't think we have time

00:45:12.425 --> 00:45:15.172
to do them here,
and I urge you to review them

00:45:15.172 --> 00:45:20.230
before the midterm,
on ClassesV2.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.518
On Wednesday--on Monday,
rather, we'll do The

00:45:23.518 --> 00:45:28.346
Communist Manifesto,
and on Wednesday we'll do Hayek

00:45:28.346 --> 00:45:32.230
and The Constitution of
Liberty,

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:36.945
so we'll see two ends of the
ideological perspective in a

00:45:36.945 --> 00:45:40.197
single week,
and after that we'll spend four

00:45:40.197 --> 00:45:42.380
straight weeks on business
cases.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.000
back to top
 

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000

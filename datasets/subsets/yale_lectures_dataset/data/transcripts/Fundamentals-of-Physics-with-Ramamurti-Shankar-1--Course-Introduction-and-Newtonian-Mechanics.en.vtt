00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.270
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: This is a first

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.322
part of the year-long course
introducing you to all the major

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:13.859
ideas in physics,
starting from Galileo and

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.742
Newton right up to the big
revolutions of the last century,

00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:23.290
which was on relativity and
quantum mechanics.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.150
The target audience for this
course is really very broad.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.116
In fact, I've always been
surprised at how broad the

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:33.870
representation is.
I don't know what your major is;

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.661
I don't know what you are going
to do later so I picked the

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:41.060
topics that all of us in physics
find fascinating.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.000
Some may or may not be useful,
but you just don't know.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.865
Some of you are probably going
to be doctors and you don't know

00:00:50.865 --> 00:00:54.730
why I'm going to do special
relativity or quantum mechanics,

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.640
but you don't know when it will
come in handy.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.070
If you're a doctor and you've
got a patient who's running away

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.209
from you at the speed of light,
you'll know what to do.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:12.394
Or, if you're a pediatrician
with a really small patient who

00:01:12.394 --> 00:01:16.026
will not sit still,
it's because the laws of

00:01:16.026 --> 00:01:20.269
quantum mechanics don't allow an
object to have a definite

00:01:20.269 --> 00:01:24.018
position and momentum.
So these are all things you

00:01:24.018 --> 00:01:27.096
just don't know when they will
come in handy,

00:01:27.096 --> 00:01:31.293
and I teach them because these
are the things that turn me on

00:01:31.293 --> 00:01:35.420
and got me going into physics
and whether or not you go into

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.356
physics,
you should certainly learn

00:01:38.356 --> 00:01:42.563
about the biggest and most
interesting revolutions right up

00:01:42.563 --> 00:01:45.099
to present day physics.
All right.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.201
So that's what the subject
matter's going to be,

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:52.028
and I'm going to tell you a
little bit about how the course

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:54.548
is organized.
First thing is,

00:01:54.548 --> 00:01:57.720
this year it's going to be
taped.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.974
You can see some people in the
back with cameras as part of an

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:06.019
experimental pilot program
funded by the Hewlett Foundation

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:09.925
and at some point they will
decide what they will do with

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:13.478
these lectures.
Most probably they'll post them

00:02:13.478 --> 00:02:17.587
somewhere so people elsewhere
can have the benefit of what you

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:22.455
have sitting in the classroom.
So I've been told that from now

00:02:22.455 --> 00:02:27.150
on we just ignore the camera and
do business as usual.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.456
Nothing's going to be changed.
I tried to negotiate a laugh

00:02:31.456 --> 00:02:34.834
track so that if the jokes don't
work we can superimpose some

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:37.190
laughter.
I was told "no."

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.220
I just got to deal with it as
it happens.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.718
So it's going to be--it's like
one of the reality shows where

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:49.291
things are going to be as they
are and hopefully after a while

00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:53.865
we'll learn to act and behave
normally and not worry about its

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.406
presence.
Then, coming to the rest of the

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.472
details of the course.
By the way, there are more

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:03.409
details on the website that I
posted, that was given to me by

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.773
the university,
if you want to know more about

00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:10.541
what all this is about.
The course organization is

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.489
fairly simple.
We're going to meet Monday and

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.090
Wednesday in this room,
11:30-12:45.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.279
I will give you some problems
to do on Wednesday and I'll post

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.477
them on the website.
You guys should get used to

00:03:25.477 --> 00:03:29.210
going to the class' website.
I'm really, really dependent on

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.699
that now.
I finally learned how to use it.

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:35.468
I will use that to post
information, maybe once in a

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:38.349
while send e-mail to the whole
class.

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.501
If you want to get those
e-mails, you got to sign up for

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:44.710
the course because I push a
button and it goes to anybody

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.125
who's signed up there.
The homework will be given on

00:03:49.125 --> 00:03:55.280
Wednesday and it's due before
class the following Wednesday.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.627
Let me introduce you to our
head TA, Mara Daniel,

00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:03.970
who's recently Mara Baraban.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.472
So Mara's going to be the
person who will see you after

00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:17.558
class and she will take the
problem sets that you have

00:04:17.558 --> 00:04:21.952
submitted before class and
she'll give you the graded ones

00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:24.089
after class.
Okay?

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:27.029
That will be sorted up,
it'll be up there.

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:30.827
So you should drop the homework
before you come into class,

00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:33.970
rather than furiously work on
it during class,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.610
and the solutions will be
posted the same afternoon.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.220
So there is not much point in
giving homework that's late.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.642
But once in a while,
you know, you will come up with

00:04:45.642 --> 00:04:47.589
a reason that I just cannot
argue with.

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:51.037
You got married,
you're getting a transplant,

00:04:51.037 --> 00:04:53.730
whatever it is.
That's fine.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.924
You got a transplant,
I want to see the old body

00:04:56.924 --> 00:04:58.732
part.
You got married,

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:02.358
I want to see your spouse.
If something happened to a

00:05:02.358 --> 00:05:05.064
grandparent, I'm counting.
Up to four I don't get

00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:06.637
suspicious.
Go five, six,

00:05:06.637 --> 00:05:09.406
seven, eight,
I will have to look into the

00:05:09.406 --> 00:05:11.488
family tree.
But, you know,

00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:14.769
any reasonable excuse will be
entertained.

00:05:14.769 --> 00:05:19.833
Relative importance given to
these different things,

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:24.527
there's 20% for your homework,
30% for the Midterm,

00:05:24.527 --> 00:05:28.930
which will be sometime in
October, and 50% for the Final.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.636
That'll be the weighted average.
But I have another plan called

00:05:33.636 --> 00:05:38.208
the "Amnesty Plan" in which I
also compare just your final

00:05:38.208 --> 00:05:40.760
grade,
what you did on the Final exam,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.067
and whichever is higher of the
two is what I will take to

00:05:44.067 --> 00:05:46.370
determine your overall course
grade.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.720
This is something I used to
announce near the end but then

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.247
some people felt that it's not
fair not to know this from the

00:05:53.247 --> 00:05:55.744
beginning.
So, I'm telling you from the

00:05:55.744 --> 00:05:59.333
beginning, but don't dream and
think that somehow the Final's

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:02.743
going to be so much different
from your regular day-to-day

00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:05.571
performance,
but to give you some reason to

00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.629
live after the Midterm.
So, you feel there is hope.

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:10.580
I can change everything
overnight;

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.244
it does happen.
I put that in for a reason

00:06:13.244 --> 00:06:16.279
because sometimes some of you
have not taken a physics course

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.212
and you don't know how to do
well in physics and slowly you

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.500
catch on and by the time it's
Final exam you crack the code;

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.174
you know how to do well.
As far as I'm concerned,

00:06:25.174 --> 00:06:28.551
that's just fine.
If at the end of the semester

00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:32.956
you take a three-hour exam in a
closed environment and you

00:06:32.956 --> 00:06:35.704
answer everything,
I don't care what you did in

00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:38.069
your homework or your Midterm.
That's not relevant.

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:40.720
So that's how the grading will
be done.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.329
We have Mara's group of TAs.
She is the head TA and she's

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:48.339
the one you should write to
whenever you have a problem.

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:51.500
Then we also have two faculty
members.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.720
One is a Postdoctoral Fellow,
Mark Caprio.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.581
So he will have a discussion
section on Tuesdays between

00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:04.278
1:00-2:00 in Sloane Lab.
And Steve Furlanetto--I don't

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:07.417
know if Steve is here or not.
There's Steve,

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:10.994
our new Assistant Professor.
He will have his section on

00:07:10.994 --> 00:07:14.439
Tuesday night in Dunham Lab,
in Room 220.

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:17.673
Tuesday night is the night when
you people realize homework is

00:07:17.673 --> 00:07:19.789
due on Wednesday.
So we know that,

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.948
so he will be there to comfort
you and give you whatever help

00:07:23.948 --> 00:07:26.740
you need.
All right.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.959
My own office hours I've not
determined yet.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:31.720
I will have to find out when it
is good for you.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.607
You know, I live and work out
of Sloane Lab up on the hill and

00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:39.495
it was easy to have office hours
before or after class but now

00:07:39.495 --> 00:07:43.562
you have to make a special trip.
So, just give me a little bit

00:07:43.562 --> 00:07:47.230
of time to find out maybe by
soliciting e-mail responses from

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.470
you what would be a good time
for my office hours.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.750
But for any procedural things,
like, you know,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.930
this problem set was not graded
properly,

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.162
and so on, there's no point
e-mailing me because I'm going

00:07:58.162 --> 00:08:01.658
to send it to Mara anyway.
So directly deal with the

00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:05.761
powers that be.
Okay, finally I want to give

00:08:05.761 --> 00:08:12.244
you some tips on how to do well
in this course and what attitude

00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:16.650
you should have.
First, I advise that you should

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:20.310
come to the lectures.
It's not self-serving;

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.904
it's not so much for my benefit.
I think there is something

00:08:25.904 --> 00:08:29.509
useful about hearing the subject
presented once orally.

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.783
Secondly, the book,
you can see,

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:38.908
one of you had a book here,
it's about 1,100 pages and when

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:43.659
I learned physics it was,
like 300 pages.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:46.870
Now, I look around this room,
I don't see anybody whose head

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:50.058
is three times bigger than mine,
so I know that you cannot

00:08:50.058 --> 00:08:51.879
digest everything the books
have.

00:08:51.879 --> 00:08:55.081
So I have to take out what I
think is the really essential

00:08:55.081 --> 00:08:57.159
part and cover them in the
lecture.

00:08:57.159 --> 00:09:00.120
So, you come to class to find
out what's in and what's not in.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.087
If you don't do that,
there's a danger you will learn

00:09:03.087 --> 00:09:06.169
something you don't have to,
and we don't want that.

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:10.029
Okay, so that's why you come to
class.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:12.891
Second thing,
most important thing for doing

00:09:12.891 --> 00:09:15.620
well in physics,
is to do the homework.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.541
The 20% given to the homework
is not a real measure of how

00:09:19.541 --> 00:09:22.786
important it is.
Homework is when you really

00:09:22.786 --> 00:09:26.129
figure out how much you know and
don't know.

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:28.039
If you watch me do the thing on
the blackboard,

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:30.756
it looks very reasonable.
It looks like you can do it but

00:09:30.756 --> 00:09:33.692
the only way you're going to
find out is when you actually

00:09:33.692 --> 00:09:35.936
deal with the problem.
That's the only time you're

00:09:35.936 --> 00:09:38.292
going to find out.
So, I ask you to do the

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:41.000
problems as and when they're
posted.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.686
So if I post it on Wednesday to
cover the material for that

00:09:44.686 --> 00:09:48.626
week, then you should attempt it
as quickly as possible because

00:09:48.626 --> 00:09:52.376
I'm going to assume you have
done the problems when you come

00:09:52.376 --> 00:09:56.375
for the next few lectures.
And in doing the homework,

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:59.399
it is perfectly okay to work in
groups.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.460
You don't have to do it by
yourself.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.036
That's not how physics is done.
I am now writing a paper with

00:10:05.036 --> 00:10:07.545
two other people.
They are my experimental

00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:10.087
colleagues who write papers with
400 other people,

00:10:10.087 --> 00:10:13.338
maybe even 1,000 other people.
When they do the big collider

00:10:13.338 --> 00:10:16.308
experiments in Geneva or
Fermilab, collaborations can run

00:10:16.308 --> 00:10:19.005
into hundreds.
So, it's perfectly okay to be

00:10:19.005 --> 00:10:22.163
part of a collaboration,
but you've got to make sure

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:26.113
that you're pulling your weight.
You've got to make sure that if

00:10:26.113 --> 00:10:28.759
you explain to others how to do
this problem,

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:31.283
then somebody else contributes
to something else,

00:10:31.283 --> 00:10:34.070
but you know what everybody
contributed in the end.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.370
So the game is not just to
somehow or other get the

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.085
solution to the problem set but
to fully understand how it's

00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:41.224
done,
and the TAs will be there to

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:44.133
help you.
Every day there's going to be a

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:48.480
TA in the undergraduate lounge.
I would urge you to use that.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:51.087
That's a beautiful new lounge
that the Provost's Office

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:53.357
allowed us to build for
physicists and chemists,

00:10:53.357 --> 00:10:55.529
or whoever happens to be in the
building.

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:58.030
If you go there on the third
floor of Sloane,

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.440
you may run into other people
like you who are trying to work

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.472
on problems.
You may run into upper-class

00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:05.999
students, students who are more
advanced, you will run into your

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:07.639
TA.
So that's a good climate.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:10.133
There are coffee machines and
there are lounge sofas and

00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:12.212
everything else.
There are computers,

00:11:12.212 --> 00:11:14.800
there are printers,
so it's a good lounge,

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:18.588
and I think if you go there one
day a week to do your problem

00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:20.853
sets,
more often that's a good

00:11:20.853 --> 00:11:23.100
meeting place,
I recommend that.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:27.679
The final piece of advice,
this is very important so

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:33.067
please pay attention to this,
which is, I ask you not to talk

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.389
to your neighbors during
lecture.

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:38.646
Now, this looks like a very
innocuous thing,

00:11:38.646 --> 00:11:41.113
but you will find out,
it is the only thing that

00:11:41.113 --> 00:11:44.188
really gets my back up.
Most of the time I don't really

00:11:44.188 --> 00:11:45.657
care.
I'm really liberal,

00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:48.557
but this disturbs me because I
am looking at you,

00:11:48.557 --> 00:11:52.060
I'm trying to see from your
reaction how much of my lecture

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.446
you are following,
and then it's very distracting

00:11:55.446 --> 00:12:00.669
when people are talking.
So please don't do that.

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:03.639
If you talk,
I am going to assume you are

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.535
talking about me.
If you laugh,

00:12:05.535 --> 00:12:07.179
I'm going to assume you are
laughing at me.

00:12:07.179 --> 00:12:11.121
That's not really what I think,
but that's how disturbing it is

00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:14.854
when people talk,
and very nice students who do

00:12:14.854 --> 00:12:19.379
not realize this often disrupt
my line of thinking.

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.149
So I ask you to keep that to a
minimum.

00:12:21.149 --> 00:12:24.384
Once in a while you'll have to
talk to your neighbor and say,

00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:27.350
"Can you please pass me my
pacemaker that fell down?"

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.966
That's fine.
Then you go back to your

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:33.009
business.
But don't do too much of that.

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:37.419
Finally, there is this ancient
issue about sleeping in class.

00:12:37.419 --> 00:12:40.006
Now, my view is,
it's just fine,

00:12:40.006 --> 00:12:42.766
okay.
I know you guys need the rest

00:12:42.766 --> 00:12:46.218
and interestingly,
the best sleepers are in the

00:12:46.218 --> 00:12:49.090
first couple of rows.
I haven't met you guys.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.930
It's not personal.
I have found some people really

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.961
have to come to the first and
second row because they claim

00:12:54.961 --> 00:12:58.149
that if they don't hear me they
cannot really go to sleep.

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:01.454
Now, that was true in Sloane
but I think Luce has got very

00:13:01.454 --> 00:13:04.470
good acoustics so you can
stretch out in the back.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.663
But my only criterion is if you
talk in your sleep,

00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:11.240
now that's not allowed because
talking is not allowed.

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:15.279
Next, if you're going to sleep,
I ask you to sit between two

00:13:15.279 --> 00:13:18.223
non-sleepers because sometimes
what happens,

00:13:18.223 --> 00:13:21.919
the whole row will topple over.
We don't want the domino effect.

00:13:21.919 --> 00:13:26.298
Now, it's going to be captured
on tape and that's going to be

00:13:26.298 --> 00:13:30.677
really bad for my reputation,
so spread yourself around other

00:13:30.677 --> 00:13:32.799
people.
All right.

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:36.580
So that's it in terms of class,
you know, logistics and

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.372
everything.
I'm going to start going into

00:13:39.372 --> 00:13:42.204
the physics proper.
I will try to finish every

00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:44.742
lecture on time,
but sometimes if I'm in the

00:13:44.742 --> 00:13:47.929
middle of a sentence or the
middle of a derivation,

00:13:47.929 --> 00:13:49.850
I may have to go over by a
couple of minutes;

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.710
there's no need to shuffle your
feet and move stuff around.

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.678
I know what time it is.
I also want to get out like you

00:13:55.678 --> 00:13:57.549
guys, but let me finish
something.

00:13:57.549 --> 00:14:00.139
Other days I may finish a few
minutes before time.

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:03.639
That's because the ideas of
physics don't fall into

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:08.120
75-minute segments and sometimes
they spill over a little bit.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.326
Also, I'm used to teaching this
course three times a week and

00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:14.864
now it's suddenly twice a week,
and so things that fell into

00:14:14.864 --> 00:14:18.605
nice 50-minute units are now
being snipped up different ways

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:21.371
so it's pretty difficult.
So, even for me,

00:14:21.371 --> 00:14:25.150
some of it will be new and the
timing may not be just right.

00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:32.198
I should tell you first of all
that in this class,

00:14:32.198 --> 00:14:35.239
the taping is not going to
affect you because the camera is

00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.588
going to be behind your head.
I mentioned to you in the

00:14:38.588 --> 00:14:42.665
website that this is not the big
opportunity you've been looking

00:14:42.665 --> 00:14:45.913
for to be a star.
Only the back of your head will

00:14:45.913 --> 00:14:47.268
be seen.
In some cases,

00:14:47.268 --> 00:14:50.647
the back of the head could be
more expressive than the front,

00:14:50.647 --> 00:14:54.139
in which case this is your
opportunity and I wish you luck.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:14:56.328
But otherwise,
just don't worry about it

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:59.960
because you will be only heard.
You may not even be heard.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.220
So, I've been asked that if a
question is not very clear,

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:06.364
I should repeat it so that
people listening to it later

00:15:06.364 --> 00:15:08.460
will know what the question was.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:16.149
Let me make one thing very
clear.

00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:18.596
That is, I'm not in favor of
your talking to each other

00:15:18.596 --> 00:15:22.116
because you're distracting.
Your stopping me at any time is

00:15:22.116 --> 00:15:24.343
just fine.
I welcome that because I've

00:15:24.343 --> 00:15:26.909
seen this subject for God knows
how many years.

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:29.381
The only thing that makes it
different for me is the

00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:33.088
questions that you people have.
You can stop me any time and

00:15:33.088 --> 00:15:37.832
you should not feel somehow you
are stopping the progress of the

00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:39.789
class.
There is no fixed syllabus.

00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:43.522
We can move things around and
it's far more exciting for me to

00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:46.520
answer your questions than to
have a monologue.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.595
So, don't worry about that.
So stop me anytime you don't

00:15:50.595 --> 00:15:53.224
follow something,
and don't assume that you're

00:15:53.224 --> 00:15:56.672
not following something because
there's something wrong with

00:15:56.672 --> 00:15:59.287
your level of comprehension.
Quite often,

00:15:59.287 --> 00:16:02.495
you guys come up with questions
that never cross my mind,

00:16:02.495 --> 00:16:05.903
so it's very interesting.
And things we've been repeating

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:08.695
year after year after year,
because they sound so

00:16:08.695 --> 00:16:10.969
reasonable,
suddenly sound unreasonable

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:14.159
when some of you point out some
aspect of it that you didn't

00:16:14.159 --> 00:16:16.143
follow.
So, it could be very

00:16:16.143 --> 00:16:20.620
interesting for all of us to
have issues to discuss in class,

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.277
and quite often some questions
are very common and your

00:16:23.277 --> 00:16:26.230
classmates will be grateful to
you that you brought it up.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:29.169
Otherwise, you know,
TAs get ten e-mails,

00:16:29.169 --> 00:16:32.540
all with the same question.
Okay.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:39.073
So I'm going to start now.
Anybody have any questions

00:16:39.073 --> 00:16:42.480
about class?
The format?

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.990
The Midterm?
The exams?

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.929
All right.
Yes?

00:16:47.929 --> 00:16:51.376
Student:
You said there's going to be

00:16:51.376 --> 00:16:54.335
two hours to be announced.
How do we wait for [inaudible]

00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:55.242
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh,

00:16:55.242 --> 00:16:58.360
you mean my office hours?
Student: No.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.058
I thought there was an
[inaudible]

00:17:00.058 --> 00:17:02.014
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:17:02.014 --> 00:17:04.536
the discussion sections are
Tuesday afternoon from

00:17:04.536 --> 00:17:07.044
1:00-2:00,
and Tuesday night from

00:17:07.044 --> 00:17:11.790
8:00-10:00, and the website has
got all the details on when and

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.299
where.
Yes?

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:14.690
Student:
So the lab times will still be

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:15.710
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.371
Shankar: Yeah.
There are many,

00:17:17.371 --> 00:17:21.430
many lab times and you have to
go to the website for the lab.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.079
And, by the way,
that reminds me.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:26.502
I've got here lots of flyers
given to me by the director of

00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:30.161
the laboratories which will tell
you which lab is the right lab

00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:32.677
for you,
and they're offered many times

00:17:32.677 --> 00:17:33.890
a week.
Yes?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.331
Student:
As far as knowing the material,

00:17:36.331 --> 00:17:38.984
just from your class,
how important is taking a lab

00:17:38.984 --> 00:17:41.221
concurrent with this class?
Professor Ramamurti

00:17:41.221 --> 00:17:42.700
Shankar: I think it's a good
idea to take the lab,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:47.071
particularly in this particular
class because I don't have any

00:17:47.071 --> 00:17:49.998
demonstrations.
They're all in the other

00:17:49.998 --> 00:17:52.147
building.
So, this will remind you that

00:17:52.147 --> 00:17:54.776
physics is, after all,
an experimental science and you

00:17:54.776 --> 00:17:57.900
will be able to see where all
the laws of physics come from.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.887
So, if you're going to take it,
you should take it at the same

00:18:00.887 --> 00:18:02.180
time.
Yes?

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.486
Student:
Could you please talk about

00:18:04.486 --> 00:18:07.177
when you expect [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:08.880
Shankar: Ah,
very good.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.720
This is a calculus-based class
and I expect everyone to know at

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.390
least the rudiments of
differential calculus.

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:19.849
What's a function,
what's a derivative,

00:18:19.849 --> 00:18:23.280
what's a second derivative,
how to take derivatives of

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.970
elementary functions,
how to do elementary integrals.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.801
Sometime later,
I will deal with functions of

00:18:29.801 --> 00:18:33.212
more than one variable,
which I will briefly introduce

00:18:33.212 --> 00:18:35.605
to you,
because that may not be a

00:18:35.605 --> 00:18:39.516
prerequisite but certainly
something you will learn and you

00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:43.089
may use on and off.
But there are different ways of

00:18:43.089 --> 00:18:46.468
doing physics.
Mine is to demonstrate over and

00:18:46.468 --> 00:18:50.900
over how little mathematics you
need to get the job done.

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.247
There are others who like to
show you how much mathematics

00:18:54.247 --> 00:18:57.359
you could somehow insinuate into
the process, okay.

00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:59.890
There are different ways of
playing the game,

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.399
and some of us find great pride
in finding the most simple way

00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:06.250
to understand something.
That's certainly my trademark;

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.119
that's how I do my research
also.

00:19:08.119 --> 00:19:11.119
So, if you feel there's not
enough math used,

00:19:11.119 --> 00:19:14.801
I guarantee you that I
certainly know enough eventually

00:19:14.801 --> 00:19:17.529
to snow the whole class,
but that's not the point.

00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:22.173
I will use it in moderation and
use it to the best effect

00:19:22.173 --> 00:19:26.320
possible rather than use it
because it is there.

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.175
Okay.
So I don't know your

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:32.054
mathematical background,
but the textbook has an

00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:35.668
appendix, which is a reasonable
measure of how much math you

00:19:35.668 --> 00:19:37.862
should know.
You've got to know your

00:19:37.862 --> 00:19:39.866
trigonometry,
you've got to know what's a

00:19:39.866 --> 00:19:41.982
sine and what's a cosine.
You cannot say,

00:19:41.982 --> 00:19:45.053
"I will look it up."
Your birthday and social

00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:48.250
security number is what you look
up.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:50.930
Trigonometry functions you know
all the time.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.030
Okay.
I will ask you, and you do.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.295
All right.
And of course,

00:19:54.295 --> 00:19:56.457
there's trigonometric
identities you know from high

00:19:56.457 --> 00:19:58.156
school.
Pages and pages of them,

00:19:58.156 --> 00:20:00.796
so no one expects you to know
all those identities,

00:20:00.796 --> 00:20:03.330
but there are a few popular
ones we will use.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:07.080
All right.
Anything else?

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.551
Yes?
Student:

00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:11.474
This may be a bit early,
but when will we be having our

00:20:11.474 --> 00:20:12.311
Midterm?
Professor Ramamurti

00:20:12.311 --> 00:20:14.644
Shankar: Yeah.
Midterm will be sometime around

00:20:14.644 --> 00:20:18.495
20th of October.
I have to find out exactly the

00:20:18.495 --> 00:20:21.603
right time.
We have 24 lectures for this

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:25.960
class and the first 12 roughly
will be part of the Midterm,

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.093
but after the 12th lecture I
may wait a week so that you have

00:20:29.093 --> 00:20:31.599
time to do the problems and get
the solutions.

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:33.350
Then I will give you the
Midterm.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.492
Yes?
Student:

00:20:36.492 --> 00:20:38.263
If wanting one of the two lab
courses, which one do you

00:20:38.263 --> 00:20:39.504
recommend?
Professor Ramamurti

00:20:39.504 --> 00:20:41.170
Shankar: Yeah,
this tells you in detail.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.319
This flyer answers exactly that.
Okay, there was one more

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:47.799
question from somebody?
Yes?

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:49.859
Student:
A few people I've talked to

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:52.800
have recommended that we start
taking the lab second semester

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.105
instead of first.
Would that be advisable or

00:20:56.105 --> 00:20:59.079
should we take both
concurrently?

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.091
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I don't have a

00:21:00.091 --> 00:21:02.290
strong view.
I think you should take the lab

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.987
sometime but I don't know how
many semesters that you have to

00:21:05.987 --> 00:21:08.567
take.
But I would say the advice of

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.230
your predecessors is very
important.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.432
If they tell you this is what
works, that's better than what

00:21:14.432 --> 00:21:17.670
somebody like me can tell you.
Also, you should talk to

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.170
Stephen Irons,
who is the director of the

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.096
labs.
He has seen every possible

00:21:22.096 --> 00:21:24.620
situation.
He will give you good advice.

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.410
Let's start now.
Okay.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:34.824
So we are going to be studying
in the beginning what's called

00:21:34.824 --> 00:21:39.002
Newtonian mechanics.
It's pretty remarkable that the

00:21:39.002 --> 00:21:43.386
whole edifice is set up by just
one person – Newton -- and he

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:46.992
sent us on the road to
understanding all the natural

00:21:46.992 --> 00:21:50.740
phenomena until the year
18-hundred-and-something when

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:54.912
Maxwell invented the laws of
electromagnetism and wrote down

00:21:54.912 --> 00:21:59.685
the famous Maxwell equations.
Except for electromagnetism,

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:03.783
the basics of mechanics,
which is the motion of billiard

00:22:03.783 --> 00:22:08.700
balls and trucks and marbles and
whatnot, was set up by Newton.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:13.113
So that's what we are going to
focus on, and you will find out

00:22:13.113 --> 00:22:17.309
that the laws of physics for
this entire semester certainly

00:22:17.309 --> 00:22:21.433
can be written on one of those
blackboards or even half of

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:25.171
those blackboards.
And the purpose of this course

00:22:25.171 --> 00:22:29.241
is to show you over and over and
over again that starting with

00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:32.716
those one or two laws,
you can deduce everything,

00:22:32.716 --> 00:22:36.119
and I would encourage you to
think the same way.

00:22:36.119 --> 00:22:39.334
In fact, I would encourage you
to think the way physicists do,

00:22:39.334 --> 00:22:41.599
even if you don't plan to be a
physicist,

00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:44.463
because that's the easiest way
to do this subject,

00:22:44.463 --> 00:22:47.620
and that is to follow the
reasoning behind everything I

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.454
give you.
And my purpose will be not to

00:22:50.454 --> 00:22:54.031
say something as a postulate,
but to show you where

00:22:54.031 --> 00:22:57.225
everything comes from,
and it's best for you if you

00:22:57.225 --> 00:23:00.121
try to follow the logic.
That way, you don't have to

00:23:00.121 --> 00:23:02.309
store too many things in your
head.

00:23:02.309 --> 00:23:04.641
In the early days when there
are four or five formulas,

00:23:04.641 --> 00:23:07.317
you could memorize all of them
and you can try each one of them

00:23:07.317 --> 00:23:09.625
until something works,
but after a couple of weeks you

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:12.150
will have a hundred formulas and
you cannot memorize all of them.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:13.650
You cannot resort to trial and
error.

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.609
So you have to know the logic.
So the logical way is not just

00:23:16.609 --> 00:23:19.589
the way the physicists do it,
it's the easier way to do it.

00:23:19.589 --> 00:23:22.569
If there is another way that it
will work for non-physicists,

00:23:22.569 --> 00:23:25.597
I won't hesitate to teach it to
you that way if that turns out

00:23:25.597 --> 00:23:29.802
to be the best way.
So try to follow the logic of

00:23:29.802 --> 00:23:31.779
everything.
Okay.

00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:35.640
So, Newtonian mechanics is our
first topic.

00:23:43.329 --> 00:23:46.300
So, Newtonian mechanics has two
parts.

00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:54.430
All of physics is a two-part
program.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:58.470
The plan, every time,
is to predict the future given

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.559
the present.
That's what we always do.

00:24:01.559 --> 00:24:03.470
When we do that right,
we are satisfied.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.046
So the question is,
"What do you mean by ‘predict

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:09.210
the future?'"
What do you mean by the future?

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:13.564
What do you mean by the present?
By "present," we mean--we will

00:24:13.564 --> 00:24:18.869
pick some part of the universe
we want to study and we will

00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:21.894
ask,
"What information do I need to

00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:25.074
know for that system at the
initial time,

00:24:25.074 --> 00:24:27.543
like,
right now, in order to be able

00:24:27.543 --> 00:24:30.467
to predict the future?"
So, for example,

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:35.295
if you were trying to study the
motion of some object,

00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:38.290
here is one example.
[throws a piece of candy for

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:39.545
someone to catch]
Professor Ramamurti

00:24:39.545 --> 00:24:41.057
Shankar: See,
that's an example of Newtonian

00:24:41.057 --> 00:24:42.931
mechanics.
I'll give you one more

00:24:42.931 --> 00:24:45.466
demonstration.
Let's see who can catch this

00:24:45.466 --> 00:24:46.241
one.
[throws another piece]

00:24:46.241 --> 00:24:47.314
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: That's a good

00:24:47.314 --> 00:24:48.996
example.
So, that was Newtonian

00:24:48.996 --> 00:24:51.740
mechanics at work,
because what did I do?

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.952
I released a piece of candy,
threw it from my hand,

00:24:55.952 --> 00:25:01.092
and the initial conditions have
to do with where did I release

00:25:01.092 --> 00:25:05.876
it and with what velocity.
That's what he sees with his

00:25:05.876 --> 00:25:09.366
eyes.
Then that's all you really need

00:25:09.366 --> 00:25:11.892
to know.
Then he knows it's going to go

00:25:11.892 --> 00:25:14.811
up, it's going to curve,
follow some kind of parabola,

00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.069
then his hands go there to
receive it.

00:25:17.069 --> 00:25:19.420
That is verification of a
prediction.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.438
His prediction was,
the candy's going to land here,

00:25:21.438 --> 00:25:23.745
then he put his hand there.
He also knew where the candy

00:25:23.745 --> 00:25:25.610
was going to land,
but he couldn't get his hand

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.563
there in time.
But we can always make

00:25:27.563 --> 00:25:29.771
predictions.
But this is a good example of

00:25:29.771 --> 00:25:32.703
what you need to know.
What is it you have to know

00:25:32.703 --> 00:25:35.463
about this object that was
thrown, I claim,

00:25:35.463 --> 00:25:39.799
is the initial location of the
object and the initial velocity.

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:42.864
The fact that it was blue or
red is not relevant,

00:25:42.864 --> 00:25:46.885
and if I threw a gorilla at him
it doesn't matter what the color

00:25:46.885 --> 00:25:49.569
of the gorilla is,
what mood it is in.

00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:52.309
These are things we don't deal
with in physics.

00:25:52.309 --> 00:25:55.789
There is a tall building,
a standard physics problem.

00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:58.170
An object falls off a tall
building.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:03.499
Object could be a person.
So we don't ask why is this guy

00:26:03.499 --> 00:26:06.307
ending it all today?
We don't know,

00:26:06.307 --> 00:26:10.490
and we cannot deal with that.
So we don't answer everything.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.682
We just want to know when he's
going to hit the pavement,

00:26:14.682 --> 00:26:17.809
and with what speed.
So we ask very limited

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:21.710
questions, which is why we brag
about how accurately we can

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.030
predict the future.
So, we only ask limited goals

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.140
and we are really successful in
satisfying them.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.589
So, we are basically dealing
with inanimate objects.

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:36.563
So the product of Newtonian
mechanics of predicting the

00:26:36.563 --> 00:26:40.690
future given the present,
has got two parts,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:45.336
and one is called kinematics
and the other is called

00:26:45.336 --> 00:26:49.539
dynamics.
So, kinematics is a complete

00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:54.849
description of the present.
It's a list of what you have to

00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:57.680
know about a system right now.
For example,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.571
if you're talking about the
chalk--if I throw the chalk,

00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:03.829
you will have to know where it
is and how fast it's moving.

00:27:03.829 --> 00:27:08.041
Dynamics then tells you why the
object goes up,

00:27:08.041 --> 00:27:13.810
why the object goes down and
why is it pulled down and so on.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:16.652
That's dynamics.
The reason it comes down is

00:27:16.652 --> 00:27:18.847
gravity is pulling it.
In kinematics,

00:27:18.847 --> 00:27:21.210
you don't ask the reason behind
anything.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:25.785
You simply want to describe
things the way they are and then

00:27:25.785 --> 00:27:30.359
dynamics tells you how they
changed and why they changed.

00:27:30.359 --> 00:27:35.517
So, I'm going to illustrate the
idea of kinematics by taking the

00:27:35.517 --> 00:27:39.331
simplest possible example.
That's going to be the way I'm

00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:41.309
going to do everything in this
course.

00:27:41.309 --> 00:27:44.557
I'm going to start with the
simplest example and slowly add

00:27:44.557 --> 00:27:48.029
on bells and whistles and make
it more and more complicated.

00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:52.449
So, some of you might say,
"Well, I've seen this before,"

00:27:52.449 --> 00:27:55.370
so maybe there is nothing new
here.

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.770
That may well be.
I don't know how much you've

00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:01.122
seen, but quite often the way
you learned physics earlier on

00:28:01.122 --> 00:28:03.850
in high school is probably
different from the way

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:06.349
professional physicists think
about it.

00:28:06.349 --> 00:28:09.274
The sense of values we have,
the things that we get excited

00:28:09.274 --> 00:28:11.694
about are different,
and the problems may be more

00:28:11.694 --> 00:28:14.152
difficult.
But I want to start in every

00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:17.218
example, in every situation that
I explain to you,

00:28:17.218 --> 00:28:20.660
with the simplest example,
and slowly add on things.

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:26.681
So, what we are going to study
now is a non-living object and

00:28:26.681 --> 00:28:31.900
we're going to pick it to be a
mathematical point.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.970
So the object is a mathematical
point.

00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:37.066
It has no size.
If you rotate it,

00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:38.849
you won't know.
It's not like a potato.

00:28:38.849 --> 00:28:40.629
You take a potato,
you turn it around,

00:28:40.629 --> 00:28:42.820
it looks different.
So, it's not enough to say the

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.868
potato is here.
You've got to say which way the

00:28:44.868 --> 00:28:47.394
nose is pointing and so on.
So, we don't want to deal with

00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:49.187
that now.
That comes later when we study

00:28:49.187 --> 00:28:52.829
what we call "rigid bodies".
Right now, we want to study an

00:28:52.829 --> 00:28:55.599
entity which has no spatial
extent.

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:59.130
So just a dot,
and the dot can move around all

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.164
over space.
So we're going to simplify that

00:29:02.164 --> 00:29:04.881
too.
We're going to take an entity

00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:07.849
that lives along the x
axis.

00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:10.410
[draws a line with integrals]
It moves along a line.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:13.982
So you can imagine a bead with
a wire going through it and the

00:29:13.982 --> 00:29:16.150
bead can only slide back and
forth.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:19.049
So, this is about the simplest
thing.

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:21.160
I cannot reduce the number of
dimensions.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:23.923
One is the lowest dimension.
I cannot make the object

00:29:23.923 --> 00:29:26.460
simpler than being just a
mathematical point.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:30.066
Then, you've got to say,
"What do I have to know about

00:29:30.066 --> 00:29:34.253
this object at the initial time?
What constitutes the present,

00:29:34.253 --> 00:29:38.130
or what constitutes maximal
information about the present?"

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:43.175
So what we do is we pick an
origin, call it zero,

00:29:43.175 --> 00:29:47.904
we put some markers there to
measure distance,

00:29:47.904 --> 00:29:53.160
and we say this guy is sitting
at 1,2, 3,4, 5.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.701
He is sitting at x = 5.
Now, of course,

00:29:57.701 --> 00:30:01.731
we've got to have units and the
units for lengths are going to

00:30:01.731 --> 00:30:05.245
be meters.
The unit for time will be a

00:30:05.245 --> 00:30:09.770
second, and time will be
measured in seconds.

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.729
Then we'll come to other units.
Right now, in kinematics,

00:30:15.729 --> 00:30:19.368
this is all you need.
Now, there are some tricky

00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:22.682
problems in the book.
Sometimes they give you the

00:30:22.682 --> 00:30:24.968
speed in miles per hour,
kilometers per year,

00:30:24.968 --> 00:30:27.150
pounds per square foot,
whatever it is.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.163
You've got to learn to
transform them,

00:30:29.163 --> 00:30:31.431
but I won't do them.
I think that's pretty

00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:34.062
elementary stuff.
But sometimes I might not write

00:30:34.062 --> 00:30:37.266
the units but I've earned the
right to do that and you guys

00:30:37.266 --> 00:30:40.250
haven't so you'll have to keep
track of your units.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.559
Everything's got to be in the
right units.

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:45.603
If you don't have the units,
then if you say the answer is

00:30:45.603 --> 00:30:48.370
19, then we don't know what it
means.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.579
Okay.
So here's an object.

00:30:50.579 --> 00:30:53.410
At a given instant,
it's got a location.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:58.597
So what we would like to do is
to describe what the object does

00:30:58.597 --> 00:31:03.450
by drawing a graph of time
versus space and the graph would

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:08.074
be something like this.
You've got to learn how to read

00:31:08.074 --> 00:31:10.374
this graph.
I'm assuming everyone knows how

00:31:10.374 --> 00:31:11.822
to read it.
[draws a graph of x

00:31:11.822 --> 00:31:13.472
versus t]
This doesn't mean the object is

00:31:13.472 --> 00:31:15.829
bobbing up and down.
I hope you realize that.

00:31:15.829 --> 00:31:19.549
Even though the graph is going
up and down, the object is

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:22.523
moving from left to right.
So, for example,

00:31:22.523 --> 00:31:25.864
when it does this,
it's crossed the origin and is

00:31:25.864 --> 00:31:29.913
going to the left of the origin.
Now, at the left of the origin,

00:31:29.913 --> 00:31:32.827
it turns around and starts
coming to the origin and going

00:31:32.827 --> 00:31:35.506
to the right.
That is x versus

00:31:35.506 --> 00:31:38.121
t.
So, in the language of

00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:43.391
calculus, x is a function
of time and this is a particular

00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:46.010
function.
This function doesn't have a

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:47.536
name.
There are other functions which

00:31:47.536 --> 00:31:48.962
have a name.
For example,

00:31:48.962 --> 00:31:51.915
this is x = t,
x = t^(2),

00:31:51.915 --> 00:31:56.345
you're going to have x = sin
t and cos t and log

00:31:56.345 --> 00:31:58.493
t.
So some functions have a name,

00:31:58.493 --> 00:31:59.960
some functions don't have a
name.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.229
What a particle tries to do
generally is some crazy thing

00:32:03.229 --> 00:32:06.149
which doesn't have a name,
but it's a function x

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:08.635
(t).
So you should know when you

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:11.480
look at a graph like this what
it's doing.

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:17.829
So, the two most elementary
ideas you learn are what is the

00:32:17.829 --> 00:32:24.288
average velocity of an object,
as then ordered by the symbol

00:32:24.288 --> 00:32:28.271
v-bar.
So, the average is found by

00:32:28.271 --> 00:32:32.672
taking two instants in time,
say t_1 and

00:32:32.672 --> 00:32:37.751
later t_2,
and you find out where it was

00:32:37.751 --> 00:32:41.879
at t_2 minus
where it was at

00:32:41.879 --> 00:32:46.289
t_1 and divide
by the time.

00:32:46.289 --> 00:32:51.680
So, the average velocity may
not tell you the whole story.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.036
For example,
if you started here and you did

00:32:55.036 --> 00:32:59.070
all this and you came back here,
the average velocity would be

00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.070
zero, because you start and end
at the same value of x,

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:06.190
you get something;
0 over time will still be 0.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.556
So you cannot tell from the
average everything that happened

00:33:09.556 --> 00:33:12.923
because another way to get the
same 0 is to just not move at

00:33:12.923 --> 00:33:14.869
all.
So the average is what it is.

00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:17.052
It's an average,
it doesn't give you enough

00:33:17.052 --> 00:33:19.889
detail.
So it's useful to have the

00:33:19.889 --> 00:33:23.748
average velocity.
It's useful to have the average

00:33:23.748 --> 00:33:26.682
acceleration,
which you can find by taking

00:33:26.682 --> 00:33:29.329
similar differences of
velocities.

00:33:29.329 --> 00:33:33.420
But before you even do that,
I want to define for you an

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.693
important concept,
which is the velocity at a

00:33:36.693 --> 00:33:41.103
given time, v (t).
So this is the central idea of

00:33:41.103 --> 00:33:44.097
calculus, right?
I am hoping that if you learned

00:33:44.097 --> 00:33:46.479
your calculus,
you learned about derivatives

00:33:46.479 --> 00:33:49.359
and so on by looking at x
versus t.

00:33:49.359 --> 00:33:53.041
So, I will remind you,
again, this is not a course in

00:33:53.041 --> 00:33:55.453
calculus.
I don't have to do it in any

00:33:55.453 --> 00:33:58.334
detail.
I will draw the famous picture

00:33:58.334 --> 00:34:03.322
of some particle moving and it's
here at t of some value

00:34:03.322 --> 00:34:06.509
of x.
A little later,

00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:12.149
which is t + Δt.
So Δt is going to stand

00:34:12.149 --> 00:34:15.469
always for a small finite
integral of time;

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.190
infinitesimal interval of time
not yet 0.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:23.206
So, during that time,
the particle has gone from here

00:34:23.206 --> 00:34:27.836
to there, that is x +
Δx, and the average

00:34:27.836 --> 00:34:32.659
velocity in that interval is
Δ x/ Δt.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:35.655
Graphically,
this guy is Δ x and

00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:39.572
this guy is Δt,
and Δx over Δt is a

00:34:39.572 --> 00:34:40.340
ratio.

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.079
So in calculus,
what you want to do is to get

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:50.269
the notion of the velocity right
now.

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:53.400
We all have an intuitive notion
of velocity right now.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.407
When you're driving in your
car, there's a needle and the

00:34:56.407 --> 00:34:58.894
needle says 60;
that's your velocity at this

00:34:58.894 --> 00:35:01.357
instant.
It's very interesting because

00:35:01.357 --> 00:35:05.407
velocity seems to require two
different times to define it --

00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:08.039
the initial time and the final
time.

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.559
And yet, you want to talk about
the velocity right now.

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:13.937
That is the whole triumph of
calculus is to know that by

00:35:13.937 --> 00:35:17.971
looking at the position now,
the position slightly later and

00:35:17.971 --> 00:35:22.071
taking the ratio and bringing
later as close as possible to

00:35:22.071 --> 00:35:24.706
right now,
we define a quantity that we

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.219
can say is the velocity at this
instant.

00:35:27.219 --> 00:35:33.320
So v of t,
v(t) is the limit,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:41.018
Δt goes to 0 of
Δx over Δt and

00:35:41.018 --> 00:35:47.989
we use the symbol dx/dt
for velocity.

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:52.275
So technically,
if you ask what does the

00:35:52.275 --> 00:35:58.210
velocity stand for--Let me draw
a general situation.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:01.486
If a particle goes from here to
here, Δx over

00:36:01.486 --> 00:36:04.951
Δt, I don't know how
well you can see it in this

00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:07.601
figure here,
is the slope of a straight line

00:36:07.601 --> 00:36:10.618
connecting these two points,
and as the points come closer

00:36:10.618 --> 00:36:13.252
and closer,
the straight line would become

00:36:13.252 --> 00:36:16.515
tangent to the curve.
So the velocity at any part of

00:36:16.515 --> 00:36:19.579
the curve is tangent to the
curve at that point.

00:36:19.579 --> 00:36:24.173
The tangent of,
this angle, this θ,

00:36:24.173 --> 00:36:31.391
is then Δx over Δt.
Okay, once you can take one

00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:35.388
derivative,
you can take any number of

00:36:35.388 --> 00:36:39.991
derivatives and the derivative
of the velocity is called the

00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:43.631
acceleration,
and we write it as the second

00:36:43.631 --> 00:36:47.534
derivative of position.
So I'm hoping you guys are

00:36:47.534 --> 00:36:52.047
comfortable with the notion of
taking one or two or any number

00:36:52.047 --> 00:36:54.587
of derivatives.
Interestingly,

00:36:54.587 --> 00:36:57.949
the first two derivatives have
a name.

00:36:57.949 --> 00:37:00.630
The first one is velocity,
the second one is acceleration.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.596
The third derivative,
unfortunately,

00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:07.579
was never given a name,
and I don't know why.

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:11.054
I think the main reason is that
there are no equations that

00:37:11.054 --> 00:37:13.570
involve the third derivative
explicitly.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.564
F = ma.
The a is this fellow

00:37:16.564 --> 00:37:19.909
here, and nothing else is given
an independent name.

00:37:19.909 --> 00:37:22.901
Of course, you can take a
function and take derivatives

00:37:22.901 --> 00:37:27.623
any number of times.
So you are supposed to know,

00:37:27.623 --> 00:37:32.127
for example,
if x(t) is t^(n),

00:37:32.127 --> 00:37:39.510
you're supposed to know
dx/dt is nt^(n-1).

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.958
Then you're supposed to know
derivatives of simple functions

00:37:42.958 --> 00:37:46.334
like sines and cosines.
So if you don't know that then,

00:37:46.334 --> 00:37:49.670
of course, you have to work
harder than other people.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:52.330
If you know that,
that may be enough for quite

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:53.040
some time.

00:37:56.949 --> 00:38:01.514
Okay, so what I've said so far
is, a particle moving in time

00:38:01.514 --> 00:38:05.306
from point to point can be
represented by a graph,

00:38:05.306 --> 00:38:09.323
x versus t.
At any point on the graph you

00:38:09.323 --> 00:38:12.503
can take the derivative,
which will be tangent to the

00:38:12.503 --> 00:38:15.593
curve at each point,
and its numerical value will be

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:18.362
what you can call the
instantaneous velocity of that

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:21.403
point and you can take the
derivative over the derivative

00:38:21.403 --> 00:38:26.356
and call it the acceleration.
So, we are going to specialize

00:38:26.356 --> 00:38:31.948
to a very limited class of
problems in the rest of this

00:38:31.948 --> 00:38:35.493
class.
A limited class of problems is

00:38:35.493 --> 00:38:39.850
one in which the acceleration is
just a constant.

00:38:47.059 --> 00:38:49.041
Now, that is not the most
general thing,

00:38:49.041 --> 00:38:52.242
but I'm sure you guys have some
idea of why we are interested in

00:38:52.242 --> 00:38:54.824
that.
Does anybody know why so much

00:38:54.824 --> 00:38:57.190
time is spent on that?
Yes?

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:57.892
Student:
[inaudible]

00:38:57.892 --> 00:38:59.190
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.166
Student:
[inaudible]

00:39:00.166 --> 00:39:01.820
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right.

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.527
The most famous example is that
when things fall near the

00:39:04.527 --> 00:39:07.530
surface of the Earth,
they all have the same

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.966
acceleration,
and the acceleration that's

00:39:10.966 --> 00:39:15.730
constant is called g,
and that's 9.8

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:21.416
meters/second^(2).
So that's a very typical

00:39:21.416 --> 00:39:23.552
problem.
When you're falling to the

00:39:23.552 --> 00:39:25.698
surface of the Earth,
you are describing a problem of

00:39:25.698 --> 00:39:28.568
constant acceleration.
That's why there's a lot of

00:39:28.568 --> 00:39:32.312
emphasis on sharpening your
teeth by doing this class of

00:39:32.312 --> 00:39:34.905
problems.
So, the question we are going

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:38.211
to ask is the following,
"If I tell you that a particle

00:39:38.211 --> 00:39:40.659
has a constant acceleration
a,

00:39:40.659 --> 00:39:44.130
can you tell me what the
position x is?"

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:50.533
Normally, I will give you a
function and tell you to take

00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:52.450
any number of derivatives.
That's very easy.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.152
This is the backwards problem.
You're only given the particle

00:39:56.152 --> 00:39:59.494
has acceleration a,
and you are asked to find out

00:39:59.494 --> 00:40:02.326
what is x?
In other words,

00:40:02.326 --> 00:40:08.467
your job is to guess a function
whose second derivative is

00:40:08.467 --> 00:40:12.295
a,
and this is called integration,

00:40:12.295 --> 00:40:15.566
which is the opposite of
differentiation,

00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:18.510
and integration is just
guessing.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.960
Integration is not an
algorithmic process like

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.424
differentiation.
If I give you a function,

00:40:24.424 --> 00:40:26.030
you know how to take the
derivative.

00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:28.533
Change the independent
variable, find the change in the

00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:30.989
function, take the ratio and
that's the derivative.

00:40:30.989 --> 00:40:33.179
The opposite is being asked
here.

00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:36.318
I tell you something about the
second derivative of a function

00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:38.119
and ask you what is the
function.

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:42.171
The way we do that is we guess,
and the guessing has been going

00:40:42.171 --> 00:40:44.916
on for 300 years,
so we sort of know how to

00:40:44.916 --> 00:40:47.529
guess.
So, let me think aloud and ask

00:40:47.529 --> 00:40:49.750
how I will guess in this
problem.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:52.255
I would say,
okay, this guy wants me to find

00:40:52.255 --> 00:40:55.867
a function which reduces to the
number a when I take two

00:40:55.867 --> 00:40:59.345
derivatives,
and I know somewhere here,

00:40:59.345 --> 00:41:03.359
this result,
which says that when I take a

00:41:03.359 --> 00:41:06.639
derivative,
I lose a power of t.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:09.960
In the end, I don't want any
powers of t.

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.000
It's very clear I've got to
start with a function that looks

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.056
like t^(2).
This way when I take two

00:41:17.056 --> 00:41:20.219
derivatives, there will be no
t left.

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:22.393
Well, unfortunately,
we know this is not the right

00:41:22.393 --> 00:41:24.522
answer, because if you take the
first derivative,

00:41:24.522 --> 00:41:27.735
I get 2t.
If I take the second derivative

00:41:27.735 --> 00:41:31.260
I get 2, but I want to get
a and not 2.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.533
Then it's very clear the way
you patch it up is you multiply

00:41:35.533 --> 00:41:38.719
it by this constant and now
we're all set.

00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:42.690
This function will have the
right second derivative.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.112
So, this certainly describes a
particle whose acceleration is

00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:49.510
a.
The a is not dependent

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.880
on time.
But the question is,

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.582
is this the most general
answer, or is it just one

00:41:55.582 --> 00:41:59.889
answer, and I think you all know
that this is not the most

00:41:59.889 --> 00:42:02.760
general answer.
It is one answer.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.518
But I can add to this some
number, like 96,

00:42:05.518 --> 00:42:08.868
that'll still have the property
that if you take two

00:42:08.868 --> 00:42:11.253
derivatives,
you're going to get the same

00:42:11.253 --> 00:42:13.857
acceleration.
So 96 now is a typical

00:42:13.857 --> 00:42:18.702
constant, so I'm going to give
the name c to that

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:21.470
constant.
Everyone knows from calculus

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.135
that if you're trying to find a
function about which you know

00:42:25.135 --> 00:42:28.368
only the derivative,
you can always add a constant

00:42:28.368 --> 00:42:31.519
to one person's answer without
changing anything.

00:42:31.519 --> 00:42:35.602
But I think here,
you know you can do more,

00:42:35.602 --> 00:42:38.148
right?
You can add something else to

00:42:38.148 --> 00:42:41.809
the answer without invalidating
it, and that is anything with

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:43.700
one power of t in it,

00:42:47.159 --> 00:42:49.448
because if you take one
derivative it'll survive,

00:42:49.448 --> 00:42:51.070
but if you take two
derivatives,

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:56.933
it'll get wiped out.
Now, it's not obvious but it is

00:42:56.933 --> 00:43:00.610
true that you cannot add to this
anymore.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:05.471
The basic idea in solving these
equations and integrating is you

00:43:05.471 --> 00:43:08.187
find one answer,
so then when you take enough

00:43:08.187 --> 00:43:10.889
derivatives, the function does
what it's supposed to do.

00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:14.088
But then having found one
answer, you can add to it

00:43:14.088 --> 00:43:17.989
anything that gets killed by the
act of taking derivatives.

00:43:17.989 --> 00:43:20.113
If you're taking only one
derivative you can add a

00:43:20.113 --> 00:43:21.587
constant.
If you're taking two

00:43:21.587 --> 00:43:24.431
derivatives you can add a
constant and something linear in

00:43:24.431 --> 00:43:26.109
t..
If you knew only the third

00:43:26.109 --> 00:43:28.050
derivative of the function,
you can have something

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.190
quadratic in t without
changing the outcome.

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:35.506
So, this is the most general
position for a particle of

00:43:35.506 --> 00:43:38.996
constant acceleration,
a. Now,

00:43:38.996 --> 00:43:43.664
you must remember that this
describes a particle going side

00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:46.282
to side.
I can also describe a particle

00:43:46.282 --> 00:43:48.359
going up and down.
If I do that,

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:51.676
I would like to call the
coordinate y,

00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:54.389
then I will write the same
thing.

00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:58.838
You've got to realize that in
calculus, the symbols that you

00:43:58.838 --> 00:44:02.909
call x and y are
completely arbitrary.

00:44:02.909 --> 00:44:05.569
If you know the second
derivative of y to be

00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:07.909
a, then the answer looks
like this.

00:44:07.909 --> 00:44:10.524
If you knew the second
derivative of x,

00:44:10.524 --> 00:44:14.911
the answer looks like that.
Now, we have to ask what are

00:44:14.911 --> 00:44:19.060
these numbers,
b and c. So let

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.630
me go back now to this
expression,

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:32.340
x(t) = at^(2)/ 2 + c +
bt.

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:38.071
It is true mathematically,
you can add two numbers,

00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.086
but you've got to ask yourself,
"What am I doing as a physicist

00:44:41.086 --> 00:44:43.760
when I add these two numbers?"
What am I supposed to do with

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.953
a and b?
I mean, with the b and

00:44:45.953 --> 00:44:48.059
c?
What value should I pick?

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:51.513
The answer is that simply
knowing the particle has an

00:44:51.513 --> 00:44:55.565
acceleration is not enough to
tell you where the particle will

00:44:55.565 --> 00:44:56.835
be.
For example,

00:44:56.835 --> 00:45:00.461
let's take the case where the
particle is falling under

00:45:00.461 --> 00:45:03.306
gravity.
Then you guys know,

00:45:03.306 --> 00:45:07.519
you just told me,
acceleration is -9.8,

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:11.846
my g is -9.8.
We call it "minus" because it's

00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:14.825
accelerating down and up was
taken to be the positive

00:45:14.825 --> 00:45:17.376
direction.
In that case,

00:45:17.376 --> 00:45:24.326
y(t) will be
-1/2gt^(2) + c + bt. So,

00:45:24.326 --> 00:45:28.017
the point is,
every object falling under

00:45:28.017 --> 00:45:31.289
gravity is given by the same
formula, but there are many,

00:45:31.289 --> 00:45:34.654
many objects that can have many
histories, all falling under

00:45:34.654 --> 00:45:37.961
gravity, and what's different
from one object and the other

00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:40.151
object is,
when was it dropped,

00:45:40.151 --> 00:45:43.420
from what height,
and with what initial speed.

00:45:43.420 --> 00:45:46.800
That's what these numbers are
going to tell us and we can

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.106
verify that as follows.
If you want to know what the

00:45:50.106 --> 00:45:53.120
number c is,
you say, let's put time t

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.648
= 0. In fact,
let me go back to this equation

00:45:56.648 --> 00:45:58.982
here.
You'll put time t =

00:45:58.982 --> 00:46:01.847
0, x(0) doesn't
have this term,

00:46:01.847 --> 00:46:05.099
doesn't have this term,
and it is c. So I

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:08.349
realize that the constant,
c, is the initial

00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:12.611
location of the object,
and it's very common to denote

00:46:12.611 --> 00:46:18.098
that by x_0. So
the meaning of the constant c is

00:46:18.098 --> 00:46:21.870
where was the object at the
initial time?

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.213
It could've been anywhere.
Simply knowing the acceleration

00:46:25.213 --> 00:46:27.889
is not enough to tell you where
it was at the initial time.

00:46:27.889 --> 00:46:30.559
You get to pick where it was at
the initial time.

00:46:30.559 --> 00:46:35.552
Then, to find the meaning of
b, we take one derivative

00:46:35.552 --> 00:46:38.971
of this, dx/dt,
that's velocity as a function

00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:41.570
of time, and if you took the
derivative of this guy,

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:47.739
you will find as at + b.
That's the velocity of the

00:46:47.739 --> 00:46:51.937
object.
Then, you can then understand

00:46:51.937 --> 00:46:59.587
that v(0) is what
b is, which we write as

00:46:59.587 --> 00:47:07.625
v_0. Okay,
so the final answer is that

00:47:07.625 --> 00:47:16.177
x(t) looks like
x_0 + v_0

00:47:16.177 --> 00:47:23.758
t + 1/2 at^(2). Okay.
So what I'm saying here is we

00:47:23.758 --> 00:47:27.554
are specializing to a limited
class of motion where the

00:47:27.554 --> 00:47:30.085
particle has a definite
acceleration,

00:47:30.085 --> 00:47:33.295
a.
Then, in every situation where

00:47:33.295 --> 00:47:37.524
the body has an acceleration
a, the location has to

00:47:37.524 --> 00:47:39.659
have this form,
where this number

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:41.918
(x_0) is where
it was initially,

00:47:41.918 --> 00:47:44.695
this (v_0 )
was the initial velocity of the

00:47:44.695 --> 00:47:47.195
object.
So, when I threw that thing up

00:47:47.195 --> 00:47:50.356
and you caught it,
what you are doing mentally was

00:47:50.356 --> 00:47:54.420
immediately figuring out where
it started and at what speed.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:59.490
That was your initial data.
Then in your mind,

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:03.971
without realizing it,
you found the trajectory at all

00:48:03.971 --> 00:48:07.193
future times.
Now, there is one other

00:48:07.193 --> 00:48:10.400
celebrated formula that goes
with this.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:13.540
I'm going to find that,
then I'll give you an example.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:22.078
Now, I'm fully aware that this
is not the flashiest example in

00:48:22.078 --> 00:48:25.760
physics, but I'm not worried
about that right now.

00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:28.776
You'll see enough things that
will confound you,

00:48:28.776 --> 00:48:32.305
but right now I want to
demonstrate a simple paradigm of

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:35.963
what it means to know the
present and what it means to say

00:48:35.963 --> 00:48:38.980
this is what the future behavior
will be.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.070
We want to do that in the
simplest context,

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.758
then we can make the example
more and more complicated,

00:48:43.758 --> 00:48:45.750
but the phenomenon will be the
same.

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:49.359
So, what we have found out so
far, I'm purposely going from

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:52.782
x to y because I
want you to know that the

00:48:52.782 --> 00:48:56.516
unknown variable can be called
an x or can be called a

00:48:56.516 --> 00:48:58.760
y.
It doesn't matter,

00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:02.110
as long as the second
derivative is a;

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:06.100
that's the answer.
Now there's a second formula

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:09.249
one derives from this.
You guys probably know that too

00:49:09.249 --> 00:49:12.559
from your days at the daycare,
but I want to derive the

00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:15.929
formula and put it up,
then we'll see how to use it.

00:49:15.929 --> 00:49:20.232
Second formula tries to relate
the final velocity of some time,

00:49:20.232 --> 00:49:23.633
t, to the initial
velocity and the distance

00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:26.340
traveled with no reference to
time.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:31.519
So the trick is to eliminate
time from this equation.

00:49:31.519 --> 00:49:33.610
So let's see how we can
eliminate time.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:38.420
You know that if you took a
derivative of this,

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:43.857
you will find v(t) is
v_0 + at. What

00:49:43.857 --> 00:49:47.527
that means is,
if you know the velocity of the

00:49:47.527 --> 00:49:50.180
given time and you know the
initial velocity,

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:52.661
you know what time it is.
The time, in fact,

00:49:52.661 --> 00:49:55.389
is v - v_0
over a.

00:49:55.389 --> 00:49:57.713
If I don't show you any
argument for v,

00:49:57.713 --> 00:50:00.605
it means v at time
t and the subscript of 0

00:50:00.605 --> 00:50:03.596
means t is zero.
So what this says is,

00:50:03.596 --> 00:50:07.170
you can measure time by having
your own clock.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.220
A clock tells you what time it
is, but you can also say what

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.271
time it is by seeing how fast
the particle is moving because

00:50:13.271 --> 00:50:15.340
you know it started with some
speed.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:17.630
It's gaining speed at some rate
a.

00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:20.886
So, if the speed was so and so
now, then the time had to be

00:50:20.886 --> 00:50:22.885
this.
So time can be indirectly

00:50:22.885 --> 00:50:27.019
inferred from these quantities.
Then you take that formula here

00:50:27.019 --> 00:50:31.045
(t) and you put it here,
(y(t)) to see a

00:50:31.045 --> 00:50:33.930
times t,
you put this expression.

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.019
So what will you get?
We'll get an expression in

00:50:36.019 --> 00:50:39.111
which there is no t;
t has been banished in

00:50:39.111 --> 00:50:41.013
favor of v.
So, I'm not going to waste your

00:50:41.013 --> 00:50:42.710
time by asking what happens if
you put it in.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:44.139
I will just tell you want
happens.

00:50:44.139 --> 00:50:49.145
What happens is,
you will find that v^(2) =

00:50:49.145 --> 00:50:55.929
v_o^(2) + 2a times
(y- y_0).

00:50:55.929 --> 00:50:58.215
[Note: The Professor said x
when he meant y]

00:50:58.215 --> 00:51:00.660
How many people have seen this
thing before?

00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:02.610
Okay.
That's a lot.

00:51:02.610 --> 00:51:06.235
Look, I know you've seen this.
At the moment,

00:51:06.235 --> 00:51:09.648
I have to go through some of
the more standard material

00:51:09.648 --> 00:51:12.809
before we go to the more
non-standard material.

00:51:12.809 --> 00:51:16.911
If this part's very easy for
you, there's not much I can do

00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:19.559
right now.
So let me draw a box.

00:51:19.559 --> 00:51:24.110
Drawing a box to you guys means
important.

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:26.570
These are the two important
things.

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.769
Remember, I want you to
understand one thing.

00:51:33.769 --> 00:51:35.780
How much of this should you
memorize?

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.559
Suppose you've never seen this
in high school.

00:51:37.559 --> 00:51:39.079
How much are you supposed to
memorize?

00:51:39.079 --> 00:51:41.125
I would say,
keep that to a minimum,

00:51:41.125 --> 00:51:44.747
because what the first formula
tells you should be so intuitive

00:51:44.747 --> 00:51:46.909
that you don't have to cram
this.

00:51:46.909 --> 00:51:49.530
We are talking about particles
of constant acceleration.

00:51:49.530 --> 00:51:52.183
That means, when I take two
derivatives, I want to get

00:51:52.183 --> 00:51:55.187
a, then you should know
enough calculus to know it has

00:51:55.187 --> 00:51:57.139
to be something like
at^(2),

00:51:57.139 --> 00:51:59.199
and half comes from taking two
derivatives.

00:51:59.199 --> 00:52:01.903
The other two you know are
stuff you can add,

00:52:01.903 --> 00:52:04.669
and you know where you're
adding those things,

00:52:04.669 --> 00:52:07.250
because the particle has a head
start.

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.979
It's got an initial position.
Even at = 0,

00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:13.161
and it has an initial velocity,
so even without any

00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:16.560
acceleration,
it will be moving from y^(0)

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:19.888
to y^(0) + vt.
The acceleration gives you an

00:52:19.888 --> 00:52:23.205
extra stuff, quadratic in time.
Once you've got that,

00:52:23.205 --> 00:52:25.656
one derivative will give you
the velocity,

00:52:25.656 --> 00:52:28.824
then in a crunch you can
eliminate t and put it

00:52:28.824 --> 00:52:31.474
into this formula.
But most people end up

00:52:31.474 --> 00:52:34.659
memorizing these two because you
use it so many times.

00:52:34.659 --> 00:52:37.512
It eventually sticks in you but
you shouldn't try to memorize

00:52:37.512 --> 00:52:40.771
everything.
So, we are now going to do one

00:52:40.771 --> 00:52:46.142
standard problem where we will
convince ourselves we can apply

00:52:46.142 --> 00:52:51.250
this formulae and predict the
future given the present.

00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:55.822
So the problem I want to
do--there are many things you

00:52:55.822 --> 00:52:59.978
could do but I just picked one,
and this is the one with round

00:52:59.978 --> 00:53:01.940
numbers so I can do it without a
calculator.

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:06.269
Here's the problem.
There is this building and it's

00:53:06.269 --> 00:53:10.964
going to be 15 meters high,
and I'm going to throw

00:53:10.964 --> 00:53:15.849
something and it's going to go
up and come down.

00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:19.370
It's something I throw up has
an initial speed of 10 meters

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.160
per second.

00:53:28.949 --> 00:53:31.987
So we have to ask now,
now that my claim is,

00:53:31.987 --> 00:53:36.297
you can ask me any question you
want about this particle and I

00:53:36.297 --> 00:53:39.502
can answer you.
You can ask me where it will be

00:53:39.502 --> 00:53:42.207
nine seconds from now,
eight seconds from now,

00:53:42.207 --> 00:53:45.889
how fast will it be moving.
I can answer anything at all.

00:53:45.889 --> 00:53:50.894
But what I needed to do this
problem was to find these two

00:53:50.894 --> 00:53:53.269
unknowns.
So, you've got to get used to

00:53:53.269 --> 00:53:55.893
the notion of what will be given
in general and what is

00:53:55.893 --> 00:53:59.758
tailor-made to the occasion.
So, we know in this example the

00:53:59.758 --> 00:54:04.172
initial height should be 15
meters and the initial velocity

00:54:04.172 --> 00:54:07.025
should be 10,
and for acceleration,

00:54:07.025 --> 00:54:10.919
I'm going to use -g and
to keep life simple,

00:54:10.919 --> 00:54:13.916
I'm going to call it -10.
As you know,

00:54:13.916 --> 00:54:17.588
the correct answer is 9.8,
but we don't want to use the

00:54:17.588 --> 00:54:20.239
calculator now so we'll call it
-10.

00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:25.716
Consequently,
for this object the position

00:54:25.716 --> 00:54:33.996
y, at any time t
is known to be 15 + 10t -

00:54:33.996 --> 00:54:41.610
5t^(2). That is the full
story of this object.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:44.440
Of course, you've got to be a
little careful when you use it.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:48.773
For example,
let's put t equal to

00:54:48.773 --> 00:54:52.630
10,000 years.
What are you going to get?

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.147
When t is equal to
10,000 years or 10000 seconds,

00:54:55.147 --> 00:54:57.940
you're going to find y
is some huge negative number.

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:02.494
You know, that's not right,
what's wrong with that

00:55:02.494 --> 00:55:04.193
reasoning?
Student:

00:55:04.193 --> 00:55:05.478
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:55:05.478 --> 00:55:07.736
Shankar: So you cannot use
the formula once it hits the

00:55:07.736 --> 00:55:09.449
ground because once it hits the
ground,

00:55:09.449 --> 00:55:13.940
the fundamental premise that
a was a constant of -9.8

00:55:13.940 --> 00:55:16.545
or -10 is wrong.
So that's another thing to

00:55:16.545 --> 00:55:18.386
remember.
Once you get a formula,

00:55:18.386 --> 00:55:21.593
you've got to always remember
the terms under which the

00:55:21.593 --> 00:55:24.550
formula was derived.
If you blindly use it beyond

00:55:24.550 --> 00:55:26.766
its validity,
you will get results which

00:55:26.766 --> 00:55:29.363
don't make any sense.
Conversely, if you get an

00:55:29.363 --> 00:55:32.272
answer and it doesn't seem to
make sense, then you've got to

00:55:32.272 --> 00:55:34.579
go back and ask,
am I violating some of the

00:55:34.579 --> 00:55:37.635
assumptions, and here you will
find the assumption that the

00:55:37.635 --> 00:55:40.743
particle had that acceleration
a is true as long it's

00:55:40.743 --> 00:55:44.219
freely falling under gravity but
not when you hit the ground.

00:55:44.219 --> 00:55:49.667
Now, if you dug a hole here
until there, and of course it

00:55:49.667 --> 00:55:53.170
may work until that happens,
okay.

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:56.483
But you've got them every time.
This is so obvious in this

00:55:56.483 --> 00:55:59.550
problem, but when you see more
complicated formula,

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:02.561
you may not know all the
assumptions that went into the

00:56:02.561 --> 00:56:05.629
derivation and quite often you
will be using it when you

00:56:05.629 --> 00:56:06.989
shouldn't.
All right.

00:56:06.989 --> 00:56:10.123
See, this you agree,
is a complete solution to this

00:56:10.123 --> 00:56:12.630
miniature, tiny,
Mickey-Mouse problem.

00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:15.619
You give me the time and I'll
tell you where it is.

00:56:15.619 --> 00:56:18.635
If you want to know how fast
it's moving at a given time,

00:56:18.635 --> 00:56:20.519
if you want to know the
velocity,

00:56:20.519 --> 00:56:25.502
I just take the derivative of
this answer, which is 10 -

00:56:25.502 --> 00:56:29.389
10t.
So let me pick a couple of

00:56:29.389 --> 00:56:33.891
trivial questions one can ask.
One can ask the following

00:56:33.891 --> 00:56:38.290
question.
How high does it go?

00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:42.059
How high will it rise?
To what height will it rise?

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:45.170
So, we know it's going to go up
and turn around and come down.

00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:48.329
We're trying to see how high
that is.

00:56:48.329 --> 00:56:53.774
So, that is a tricky problem to
begin with because if you take

00:56:53.774 --> 00:56:58.030
this formula here,
it tells you y if you

00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:02.090
know t,
but no, we're not saying that.

00:57:02.090 --> 00:57:05.346
We don't know the time and we
don't know how high it's rising

00:57:05.346 --> 00:57:07.843
so you can ask,
"How am I supposed to deal with

00:57:07.843 --> 00:57:10.359
this problem?"
Then you put something else

00:57:10.359 --> 00:57:13.666
that you know in your mind,
which is that the highest point

00:57:13.666 --> 00:57:17.030
is the point when it's neither
going up nor coming down.

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:19.380
If it's going up,
that's not the highest point.

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.889
If it's coming down,
that's not the highest point.

00:57:21.889 --> 00:57:24.586
So at the highest point it
cannot go up and it cannot go

00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:27.401
down.
That's the point where velocity

00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:29.286
is 0.
If you do that,

00:57:29.286 --> 00:57:35.101
let's call the particular time
t*, then 10t* - 10

00:57:35.101 --> 00:57:39.510
= 0, or t*
is 1 second.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:46.127
So we know that it'll go up for
one second then it will turn

00:57:46.127 --> 00:57:51.009
around and come back.
Now, we are done because now we

00:57:51.009 --> 00:57:56.964
can ask how high does it go,
and you go back to your,

00:57:56.964 --> 00:58:02.690
and y (1) is 15 + 10 -
5, which is what?

00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:07.400
Twenty meters.
By the way, you will find that

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:11.050
I make quite a lot of mistakes
on the blackboard.

00:58:11.050 --> 00:58:13.753
You're going to find out,
you know, one of these years

00:58:13.753 --> 00:58:16.711
when you start teaching that
when you get really close to a

00:58:16.711 --> 00:58:18.650
blackboard, you just cannot
think.

00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:22.227
There's definitely some inverse
correlation between your level

00:58:22.227 --> 00:58:25.159
of thinking and the proximity to
the blackboard.

00:58:25.159 --> 00:58:29.510
So if you find me making a
mistake, you've got to stop me.

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:31.230
Why do you stop me?
For two reasons.

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.399
First of all,
I'm very pleased when this

00:58:33.399 --> 00:58:36.459
happens, because I'm pretty
confident that I can do this

00:58:36.459 --> 00:58:38.907
under duress,
but I may not do it right every

00:58:38.907 --> 00:58:41.013
time.
But if my students can catch me

00:58:41.013 --> 00:58:43.277
making a mistake,
it means they are following it

00:58:43.277 --> 00:58:45.300
and they are not hesitating to
tell me.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.646
Secondly, as we go to the more
advanced part of the course,

00:58:48.646 --> 00:58:51.820
we'll take a result from this
part of the blackboard,

00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:54.230
stick it into the second part
and keep manipulating,

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.687
so if I screwed up in the
beginning and you guys keep

00:58:56.687 --> 00:58:58.326
quiet,
we'll have to do the whole

00:58:58.326 --> 00:59:01.954
thing again.
I would ask you when you follow

00:59:01.954 --> 00:59:07.260
this thing to do it actively.
Try to be one step ahead of me.

00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:10.507
For example,
if I'm struck by lightning,

00:59:10.507 --> 00:59:13.466
can you do anything?
Can you guess what I'm going to

00:59:13.466 --> 00:59:15.765
say next?
Do you have any idea where this

00:59:15.765 --> 00:59:17.949
is going?
You should have a clue.

00:59:17.949 --> 00:59:21.212
If I die and you stop,
that's not a good sign,

00:59:21.212 --> 00:59:22.860
okay.
You've got to keep going a

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:25.139
little further because you
should follow the logic.

00:59:25.139 --> 00:59:27.549
So, for example,
you know, I'm going to

00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:30.150
calculate next when it hits the
ground.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:32.889
You should have some idea of
how I'll do it.

00:59:32.889 --> 00:59:34.989
But this is not a spectator
sport.

00:59:34.989 --> 00:59:37.280
If you just watch me,
you're going to learn nothing.

00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.890
It's like watching the U.S.
Open and thinking you're some

00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:42.040
kind of a player.
You will have to shed the tears

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.907
and you've got to bang your head
on the wall and go through your

00:59:44.907 --> 00:59:47.940
own private struggle.
I cannot do that for you.

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:50.864
I cannot even make it look hard
because I have memorized this

00:59:50.864 --> 00:59:53.400
problem from childhood,
so there is no way I can make

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.800
this look difficult.
That's your job.

00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.433
All right.
So, we know this point at one

00:59:59.433 --> 01:00:02.810
second is 20 meters,
so let's just ask one other

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:06.465
question and we'll stop.
One other question may be,

01:00:06.465 --> 01:00:09.700
"When does it hit the ground
and at what speed?"

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:13.440
-- a typical physics question.
So when does it hit the ground?

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:20.119
Well, I think you must know now
how to formulate that question.

01:00:20.119 --> 01:00:23.439
"When does it hit the ground"
is "When is y =

01:00:23.439 --> 01:00:26.169
0"?
By the way, I didn't tell you

01:00:26.169 --> 01:00:30.405
this but I think you know that I
picked my origin to be here and

01:00:30.405 --> 01:00:34.573
measured y positively to
be upwards and I called that 15

01:00:34.573 --> 01:00:37.340
meters.
You can call that your origin.

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:41.106
If you call that your origin,
your y_0 will

01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:43.980
be 0, but ground will be called
-15.

01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.385
So, in the end,
the physics is the same but the

01:00:46.385 --> 01:00:48.530
numbers describing it can be
different.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.570
We have to interpret the data
differently.

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:55.119
But the standard origin for
everybody is the foot of the

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:58.372
building.
You can pick your origin here,

01:00:58.372 --> 01:01:01.050
some crazy spot.
It doesn't matter.

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:04.483
But some origins are more equal
than others because there is

01:01:04.483 --> 01:01:07.914
some natural landmark there.
Here, the foot of the building

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:11.580
is what I call the origin.
So, in that notation,

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.369
I want to ask,
when is y = 0?

01:01:15.369 --> 01:01:21.591
I ask when y = 0,
then I say 0 = 15 +

01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:27.134
10t - 5t^(2).
Or I'm canceling the 5

01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:32.675
everywhere and changing the sign
here I get t^(2) - 2t

01:01:32.675 --> 01:01:36.430
- 3 = 0.
That's when it hits the ground.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.429
So let's find out what the time
is.

01:01:42.429 --> 01:01:52.449
So t is then 2 + or -
or + 12 over 2,

01:01:52.449 --> 01:02:03.269
which is 2 + or - 4 over
2, which is -1 or 3.

01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:07.320
Okay, so you get two answers
when it hits the ground.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:11.680
So it's clear that we should
pick 3.

01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:19.916
But you can ask,
"Why is it giving me a second

01:02:19.916 --> 01:02:23.420
solution?"
Anybody have an idea why?

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.504
Student:
Because there was an entire

01:02:26.504 --> 01:02:29.589
parabola [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:33.559
Shankar: That's correct.
So her answer was,

01:02:33.559 --> 01:02:38.510
if it was a full parabola,
then we know it would've been

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:42.469
at the ground before I set my
clock to 0.

01:02:42.469 --> 01:02:44.401
First of all,
negative time should not bother

01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:46.499
anybody;
t = 0 is when I set the

01:02:46.499 --> 01:02:49.707
clock, I measured time forward,
but yesterday would be t

01:02:49.707 --> 01:02:50.980
= -1 day,
right?

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.360
So we don't have any trouble
with negative times.

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.426
So the point is,
this equation,

01:02:56.426 --> 01:03:00.309
it does not know about the
building.

01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:03.361
Doesn't know the whole song and
dance that you went to a

01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:05.970
building and you threw up a rock
or anything.

01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:10.153
What does the mathematics know?
It knows that this particle

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:15.940
happened to have a height of 15,
a time 0, and a velocity of 10,

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.895
a time 0, and it is falling
under gravity with an

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:22.010
acceleration of -10.
That's all it knows.

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:26.035
If that's all it knows,
then in that scenario there is

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:30.641
no building or anything else;
it continues a trajectory both

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:35.294
forward in time and backward in
time, and it says that whatever

01:03:35.294 --> 01:03:37.903
seconds,
one second before you set your

01:03:37.903 --> 01:03:40.519
clock to 0, it would've been on
the ground.

01:03:40.519 --> 01:03:44.364
What it means is if you'd
release a rock at that location

01:03:44.364 --> 01:03:48.690
one second before with a certain
speed that we can calculate,

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:51.757
it would've ended up here with
precisely the position and

01:03:51.757 --> 01:03:54.659
velocity it had at the beginning
of our experiment.

01:03:54.659 --> 01:03:59.052
So sometimes the extra solution
is very interesting and you

01:03:59.052 --> 01:04:03.369
should always listen to the
mathematics when you get extra

01:04:03.369 --> 01:04:06.480
solutions.
In fact, when a very famous

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.506
physicist, Paul Dirac,
was looking for the energy of a

01:04:10.506 --> 01:04:14.000
particle in relativistic quantum
mechanics,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.877
he found the energy of a
particle is connected to its

01:04:16.877 --> 01:04:19.700
momentum, this p is what
we call momentum,

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:27.764
and its mass by this relation.
It's a particle of mass

01:04:27.764 --> 01:04:30.982
m and momentum p
has this energy so you solve for

01:04:30.982 --> 01:04:32.800
the energy, you get two answers.

01:04:37.409 --> 01:04:40.815
Now, your temptation is to keep
the first answer because you

01:04:40.815 --> 01:04:43.239
know energy is not going to be
negative.

01:04:43.239 --> 01:04:45.590
Particle's moving,
it's got some energy and that's

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:47.337
it.
But the mathematicians told

01:04:47.337 --> 01:04:50.743
Dirac, "You cannot ignore the
negative energy solution because

01:04:50.743 --> 01:04:53.982
it tells you there's a second
solution and you cannot throw

01:04:53.982 --> 01:04:56.593
them out,"
and it turns out the second

01:04:56.593 --> 01:05:00.600
solution, with negative energy,
was when the theory is telling

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:02.652
you,
hey, there are particles and

01:05:02.652 --> 01:05:05.666
there are anti-particles,
and the negative energy when

01:05:05.666 --> 01:05:08.680
properly interpreted will
describe anti-particles.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:12.519
So the equations are very smart.
The way the physics works is

01:05:12.519 --> 01:05:15.619
you will find some laws of
motion in mathematical form,

01:05:15.619 --> 01:05:17.387
you put in the initial
conditions of whatever,

01:05:17.387 --> 01:05:19.470
you solve the equations,
and the answer that comes,

01:05:19.470 --> 01:05:22.023
you have no choice.
You have to accept the answer,

01:05:22.023 --> 01:05:24.576
but there are new answers
besides the one you were looking

01:05:24.576 --> 01:05:26.295
for.
You've got to think about what

01:05:26.295 --> 01:05:28.965
they mean, and that's one of the
best things about physics

01:05:28.965 --> 01:05:32.010
because here's a person who is
not looking for anti-particles.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:35.122
He was trying to describe
electrons, but the theory said

01:05:35.122 --> 01:05:38.065
there are two roots in the
quadratic equation and the

01:05:38.065 --> 01:05:41.800
second root is mathematically as
interesting as the first one.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.428
It has to be part of a theory,
and then trying to adjust it so

01:05:45.428 --> 01:05:48.639
it can be incorporated,
you discover anti-particles.

01:05:48.639 --> 01:05:52.569
So always amazing to us how we
go into the problem,

01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:56.420
our eye or mind can see one
class of solutions,

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.787
but the math will tell you
sometimes there are new

01:05:58.787 --> 01:06:01.492
solutions and you've got to
respect it and understand and

01:06:01.492 --> 01:06:03.280
interpret the unwanted
solutions,

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.043
and this is a simple example
where you can follow what the

01:06:07.043 --> 01:06:09.420
meaning of the second solution
is.

01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:12.992
It means that to the problem
you pose, there's more than the

01:06:12.992 --> 01:06:16.664
answers that you could imagine.
Here it meant particle that was

01:06:16.664 --> 01:06:18.500
released from the ground
earlier.

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:21.334
There it meant something much
more interesting,

01:06:21.334 --> 01:06:24.230
mainly anti-particles
accompanying particles.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:27.515
They are going to accompany
particles surely as every

01:06:27.515 --> 01:06:29.980
quadratic equation has two
solutions.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:34.971
All right, so now in this
problem, we can do something

01:06:34.971 --> 01:06:39.492
slightly different,
and let's use this expression

01:06:39.492 --> 01:06:41.564
here,
and I will do that,

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:45.484
then I'll stop for today.
If you were asking questions,

01:06:45.484 --> 01:06:49.819
like, how high does it go,
but you don't ask when does it

01:06:49.819 --> 01:06:53.200
go to the highest point,
then you don't have to go

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:56.092
through the whole process of
finding the time at which it

01:06:56.092 --> 01:06:58.277
turned around.
I don't know where that is,

01:06:58.277 --> 01:07:00.748
that disappeared on the
blackboard, then putting the

01:07:00.748 --> 01:07:02.880
time equal to 1 second into this
formula.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.128
If the question of time is not
explicitly brought up,

01:07:06.128 --> 01:07:09.690
then you should know that you
have to use this formula.

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:15.510
So how do we get it here?
Well, we say at the top of the

01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:20.139
loop, when it goes up and comes
down the velocity is 0.

01:07:20.139 --> 01:07:26.586
Therefore, you say 0^(2)
= initial velocity^(2)

01:07:26.586 --> 01:07:32.465
+ 2 times -g,
that's my acceleration,

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:38.407
times y - y_0.
If you solve for that,

01:07:38.407 --> 01:07:43.401
you find y - y_0 =
v_0^(2) over

01:07:43.401 --> 01:07:46.347
2g,
and if you put in the

01:07:46.347 --> 01:07:50.393
v_0 I gave you,
which was what,

01:07:50.393 --> 01:07:54.150
10?
That's 100 over 20,

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:59.809
which is 5 meters.
So y = y_0 + 5

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:03.789
meters, and that was the height
to which it rises.

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:05.909
I think we got it somewhere
else.

01:08:05.909 --> 01:08:08.530
We found the maximum height to
be 20 meters.

01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:16.720
Another thing you can do is you
can find the speed here.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:21.050
If you want to find the speed
there, you put the equation

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:25.071
v^(2) = v_0^(2)
+ 2 times -g (y -

01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:27.766
y_0).
What is y -

01:08:27.766 --> 01:08:30.663
y_0?
The final y is 0,

01:08:30.663 --> 01:08:34.244
the initial y is
15. You solve for that

01:08:34.244 --> 01:08:37.619
equation and you will find the
final velocity.

01:08:37.619 --> 01:08:42.909
So, if time is not involved,
you can do it that way.

01:08:42.909 --> 01:08:46.190
I want to derive the last
result in another way,

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:49.401
then I will stop,
and that's pretty interesting

01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:53.239
because it tells you the use and
abuse of calculus.

01:08:53.239 --> 01:08:58.400
So I'm going to find for you
this result using calculus in a

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:04.470
different way.
So, from the calculus we know

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:09.697
dv/dt = a.
Now, multiply both sides by

01:09:09.697 --> 01:09:10.560
v.

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.482
Now you have to know from
elementary calculus that

01:09:19.482 --> 01:09:24.066
v times dv/dt is
really d by dt of

01:09:24.066 --> 01:09:28.091
v^(2) over 2.
Now, I hope you guys know that

01:09:28.091 --> 01:09:31.424
much calculus,
that when you take a derivative

01:09:31.424 --> 01:09:35.211
of a function of a function,
namely v^(2) over 2 is a

01:09:35.211 --> 01:09:37.375
function of v,
and v itself is a

01:09:37.375 --> 01:09:39.863
function of t,
then the rule for taking the

01:09:39.863 --> 01:09:42.483
derivative is first take the
v derivative of this

01:09:42.483 --> 01:09:44.359
object,
then take the d by

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.710
dt of t,
which is this one.

01:09:46.710 --> 01:09:52.204
On the right-hand side,
I'm going to write as a

01:09:52.204 --> 01:10:00.250
dx/dt.
This much is standard.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:05.493
I'm going to do something which
somehow we are told never,

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:10.369
ever to do, which is to just
cancel the dts.

01:10:10.369 --> 01:10:13.343
You all know that when you do
dy/dx,

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:16.600
you're not supposed to cancel
that d.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.895
That's actually correct.
You don't want to cancel the

01:10:18.895 --> 01:10:20.960
d in the derivative.
But this happens to be

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.323
completely legitimate,
so I'm going to assume it's

01:10:23.323 --> 01:10:25.878
true and I'll maybe take a
second and explain why it's

01:10:25.878 --> 01:10:28.656
legitimate.
What this really means is in a

01:10:28.656 --> 01:10:32.202
given time, Δt,
the change in this quantity is

01:10:32.202 --> 01:10:35.279
a times the change in
this quantity.

01:10:35.279 --> 01:10:38.565
Therefore, you can multiply
both sides by the Δt,

01:10:38.565 --> 01:10:41.909
but the only thing you should
understand is Δt,

01:10:41.909 --> 01:10:45.685
as long as it's small and
finite, will lead to some small

01:10:45.685 --> 01:10:49.336
infinite errors in the formula,
because the formula is really

01:10:49.336 --> 01:10:52.239
the limit in which Δx
and Δt both go to 0.

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:54.688
So what you have to do is
multiply both sides by

01:10:54.688 --> 01:10:57.813
Δt, but remember it's
got to be in the end made to be

01:10:57.813 --> 01:11:00.902
vanishingly small.
As long as we understand that,

01:11:00.902 --> 01:11:04.918
we can do this cancellation and
this says on the left-hand side

01:11:04.918 --> 01:11:08.609
the change in the quantity
v^(2) over 2 is a

01:11:08.609 --> 01:11:12.430
times the change in the quantity
x. So add up all the

01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:15.280
changes or what you mean by
integral.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.510
Same thing.
Add up all the changes.

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:22.005
The change in v^(2) over
2 will be the final v^(2)

01:11:22.005 --> 01:11:25.358
over 2 - the initial
v^(2) over 2 and the

01:11:25.358 --> 01:11:29.140
other side will be a
times change in x;

01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:34.991
x - x^(0) and that's the
formula I wrote for you:

01:11:34.991 --> 01:11:40.279
v^(2) is
v_0^(2) + 2a

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:45.059
(x - x^(0)). So,
the point is whenever you have

01:11:45.059 --> 01:11:49.219
derivatives with something over
dt, do not hesitate to

01:11:49.219 --> 01:11:53.587
cancel the dts and think
of them as Δv^(2) over 2

01:11:53.587 --> 01:11:57.608
is equal to a times
Δ of x. This will

01:11:57.608 --> 01:12:01.630
be actually true as long as both
quantities are vanishingly

01:12:01.630 --> 01:12:04.160
small.
They will become more and more

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.296
true as Δx and
Δv^(2) become

01:12:06.296 --> 01:12:09.124
vanishingly small,
in the limit in which they are

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:10.909
approaching 0,
the two will be,

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.453
in fact, equal.
If Δx is a finite

01:12:13.453 --> 01:12:16.459
amount, like 1 second,
this will not be true because

01:12:16.459 --> 01:12:19.673
in the starting equation,
Δx and Δt and

01:12:19.673 --> 01:12:22.529
Δv^(2) were all assumed
to be infinitesimal.

01:12:22.529 --> 01:12:26.373
So don't hesitate to do
manipulations of this type,

01:12:26.373 --> 01:12:30.738
and I will do them quite often.
So you've got to understand

01:12:30.738 --> 01:12:33.380
when it's okay and when it's not
okay.

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:36.073
What this means is,
in a time Δt,

01:12:36.073 --> 01:12:38.699
this quantity changes by some
amount,

01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:40.980
and in the same time,
Δt, that quantity

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.460
changes by some amount,
then keeping the Δt

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:46.237
equal to some number we may
equate the changes of the two

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.913
quantities,
provided it is understood that

01:12:48.913 --> 01:12:52.457
Δv^(2) over 2 is a
change in v^(2) over 2 in

01:12:52.457 --> 01:12:55.880
the same time in which the
particle moved a distance,

01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:58.265
Δx.
Adding the differences,

01:12:58.265 --> 01:13:01.470
we eliminate time and we get
this final result.

01:13:01.470 --> 01:13:05.612
All right.
So if you go to your website

01:13:05.612 --> 01:13:09.034
today, you will find I've
assigned some problems and you

01:13:09.034 --> 01:13:13.010
should try to do them.
They apply to this chapter.

01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:15.656
Then next week we'll do more
complicated problems that

01:13:15.656 --> 01:13:18.252
involve motion in higher
dimensions, how to go to two

01:13:18.252 --> 01:13:20.385
dimensions or three dimensions.

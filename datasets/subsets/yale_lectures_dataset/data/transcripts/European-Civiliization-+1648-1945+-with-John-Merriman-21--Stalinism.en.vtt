00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.202
Prof: Today I want to
talk about Stalinism,

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:08.050
and,
in doing so--fifteen years ago,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.990
lots of what we now know about
the Soviet Union through its

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.445
entire history we didn't know,
because the archives weren't

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:19.890
open.
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.704
When the Soviet Union
collapsed, fell apart,

00:00:24.704 --> 00:00:30.750
disintegrated in the early
1990s, gradually lots of the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.550
archives were opened.
 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:40.887
What I have to say today--I
don't work in the Soviet

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:47.650
Union--draws upon the work of
Peter Holquist.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.795
He used to teach at Cornell and
now teaches at Princeton,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:01:00.158
and more recent work on
Stalinism by Sheila Fitzpatrick.

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:06.200
Let me just lay out the
overview at the beginning.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.721
I sent around this morning--I
didn't get home until real late

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:11.590
last night,
so I sent along at about 12:30

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.802
in the morning various terms,
but I forgot a

00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:17.938
couple--democratic centralism,
right opposition,

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:21.530
and Bukharin--but this stuff is
all in the book.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.040
I hope you're able to get that.
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.540
I'll do the same for next time.
 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:34.215
The question remains:
did Lenin inevitably lead to

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:35.810
Stalin?
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.000
That's a hard one.
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.025
I guess basically the structure
of what morphed into the Soviet

00:01:47.025 --> 00:01:51.671
regime was set,
the way that the Bolshevik

00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:56.769
party operated,
even before taking power.

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:59.890
The fundamental concept was
democratic centralism.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.131
That is the way that the Soviet
state became organized as a

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:14.122
top-down way of making decisions
and sending out relevant

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:16.370
communication.
 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.763
In principle,
it was supposed to involve

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:22.460
debate at the highest levels.
 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.346
Then, once decisions were
taken, then they were

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:29.979
communicated through the
Communist Party.

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.740
But, of course,
the sheer paranoia of

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.810
Stalin--he was,
as you know,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.650
a clinical paranoid.
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.690
His paranoia led to the deaths
of millions of people.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.830
Debate itself became,
as a concept under Stalinism,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.060
identified with anti-Soviet
behavior.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.322
Essentially,
what had begun as a popular

00:02:55.322 --> 00:03:00.132
revolution on behalf of working
people--also,

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:03.026
to an extent,
on behalf of

00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:06.734
nationalities--became the
dictatorship not of the

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.068
proletariat,
not of the proletariat but of

00:03:10.068 --> 00:03:13.782
the Communist Party,
of the Bolshevik Party

00:03:13.782 --> 00:03:19.474
transformed into the Communist
Party and the dictatorship of

00:03:19.474 --> 00:03:20.438
Stalin.
 

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:28.220
Of course, as his paranoia
increased the purges followed.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.440
The big show trials,
some of which where people,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.902
Western communists went in,
and sat and listened to hear

00:03:37.902 --> 00:03:43.038
people confess to having been in
cahoots with Nazis,

00:03:43.038 --> 00:03:47.128
or with English royalists,
or whomever,

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.603
and confess to things that they
certainly had never done not

00:03:50.603 --> 00:03:52.370
long before their execution.
 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.289
One of the points to be made
today is,

00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:02.668
following Peter Holquist,
that the structure of the

00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:09.578
Stalinist terror--there were
antecedents that one could see

00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:16.041
in the civil war,
and in the period of Lenin's

00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:23.259
domination in the early years of
the Soviet Union.

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:31.636
But very early on,
the people who imagined that

00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:40.740
nationalities would have
autonomy, those hopes were

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.839
destroyed quite quickly.
 

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:49.574
Stalin, he had been minister,
or whatever they called the

00:04:49.574 --> 00:04:51.509
Commissar of Nationalities.
 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.345
The idea that workers'
self-management,

00:04:54.345 --> 00:04:56.644
self-control,
control of the means of

00:04:56.644 --> 00:05:00.297
production,
would be implemented in this

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:06.785
new brave world was shattered
rather quickly with strikes and

00:05:06.785 --> 00:05:14.089
protests by workers,
smashed by the police,

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:16.060
by the Soviet state.
 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.786
The illusion would be
perpetuated in the 1920s,

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:26.026
and even in the 1930s,
that this was a true workers'

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:30.649
paradise, and that everything
was groovy.

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:34.160
But the talk was always about
the "radiant future."

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.379
Radiant was a word that they
used a lot.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:39.269
I'll talk more about this in a
while.

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:40.819
The future would be radiant.
 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:41.800
It would be glorious.
 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.629
But the sacrifices had to be
made now,

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.680
and they had to be made now to
protect the revolution against

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.519
the Americans,
against the French,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:53.959
and against the British,
and the powers of capitalism,

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:54.949
etc., etc.
 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.240
Of course, as you all know,
it never came to be.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.329
That's the tragedy of the
Russian Revolution.

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:13.528
Well, more about this in a
while.

00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:18.399
First of all,
as backdrop to all of this,

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:22.726
because of the civil war,
and because of famine

00:06:22.726 --> 00:06:25.805
conditions,
and because of just enormous

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:32.189
economic hardship,
trying to have a state--;it was

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:39.000
not clear how this could
possibly be done.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.870
You've got a country with all
these nationalities,

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.374
which is basically still
essentially a country of

00:06:45.374 --> 00:06:47.872
peasants,
despite the industrial work in

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:51.379
the Ural mountains,
and in the mines,

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:57.822
and in the town of Petrograd
that became Leningrad,

00:06:57.822 --> 00:07:00.269
obviously, later.
 

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:01.810
You're going to know how to do
this.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.127
The war itself,
as in all of the countries that

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:09.240
participated in World War I,
had done enormous ravages.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.129
The Germans are fighting inside
Russia,

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.721
and the subsequent civil war
that decimated large parts of

00:07:18.721 --> 00:07:24.509
the countryside left the country
barely able to function.

00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:29.906
In 1921 and 1922,
this is in what you're reading,

00:07:29.906 --> 00:07:36.764
more than seven million people
died of starvation and sickness

00:07:36.764 --> 00:07:39.350
during that period.
 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.139
Remember, the wars go on.
 

00:07:41.139 --> 00:07:45.129
The war against Poland goes on
until finally the situation is

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:49.319
resolved with the Treaty of Riga
in 1921, which I don't think is

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.449
in your book.
 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:56.750
Lenin implemented the New
Economic Policy.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:04.572
As he and the other Soviet
leaders grappled with a country

00:08:04.572 --> 00:08:12.918
in virtual collapse,
he recognized that the ideology

00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:17.997
of communism,
which called for the abolition

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.110
of private property,
private ownership,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.129
and the destruction of the free
market,

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:28.250
would have to be sacrificed for
the future.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.449
You simply had to be able to
feed people.

00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:35.041
You had to have peasants not
hoarding what they produced,

00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:37.029
or waiting for higher prices.
 

00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:39.259
You needed to have a free
market system,

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:45.371
at least for a while,
because of the fact that people

00:08:45.371 --> 00:08:49.368
resisted,
which was what was called war

00:08:49.368 --> 00:08:52.798
communism,
which was sort of a shock

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:57.960
communist therapy that had
proved not to really work at

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.629
all.
 

00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:04.087
So, the New Economic Policy is
promulgated in March of 1921,

00:09:04.087 --> 00:09:08.158
and the features of it you can
read about.

00:09:08.158 --> 00:09:13.120
Basically, the state maintains
its centralized control over the

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.130
economy,
and there's still centralized

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:20.182
planning,
but the NEP allowed peasants to

00:09:20.182 --> 00:09:25.416
use their land as if it was
their own, and largely,

00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:31.695
in most cases it still was,
and allowed them to market

00:09:31.695 --> 00:09:37.686
their products,
and sell them at market prices

00:09:37.686 --> 00:09:43.830
in order to get food to people
who needed it.

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:46.090
Otherwise, they too would have
died.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:51.570
The state maintained its
control over heavy industry.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:58.513
But this is all going to be
just a small retreat along the

00:09:58.513 --> 00:10:00.950
road to socialism.
 

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.360
It succeeded.
 

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.960
It succeeded.
 

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.360
It works.
 

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:11.934
Gradually the production of
food reached prewar levels,

00:10:11.934 --> 00:10:17.778
and small-scale industrial
production revives.

00:10:17.778 --> 00:10:23.527
Another name I should have
written on the board--I was so

00:10:23.527 --> 00:10:28.658
tired when I did all this last
night--is Kulaks.

00:10:28.658 --> 00:10:33.918
Two groups of people who
profited during this period,

00:10:33.918 --> 00:10:38.490
these two groups of people
would,

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:41.720
in the long memory of the
communist leadership,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:47.690
get theirs during the Five Year
Plan.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:50.340
The first are those people who,
for example,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.090
were small merchants--not in
size,

00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:00.798
but they sold products on the
free market and did very,

00:11:00.798 --> 00:11:05.029
very well during this period of
the New Economic Policy.

00:11:05.029 --> 00:11:07.370
They became known as NEP men.
 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.894
NEP is the New Economic Policy,
and the NEP men were people who

00:11:10.894 --> 00:11:12.600
did well during this period.
 

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.080
The other, and it's a term,
as we'll see in a while,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.048
that became a term of
denigration,

00:11:18.048 --> 00:11:22.408
and indeed could lead you
straight to the gulag if you

00:11:22.408 --> 00:11:27.259
were lucky and weren't executed
before that, were Kulaks.

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:31.379
Kulaks basically were
prosperous peasants.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:33.190
They were well-off peasants.
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.070
During the period of the New
Economic Policy the Kulaks,

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.250
the people with land who had
something to sell,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:43.990
did well indeed,
because their goods fetched

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.308
good prices and they did very
well.

00:11:48.308 --> 00:11:54.288
With the gradual ending of the
New Economic Policy,

00:11:54.288 --> 00:11:58.500
which sort of trickles to an
end after Lenin,

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.758
they would become targets in
the mass collectivization

00:12:03.758 --> 00:12:08.519
campaign that accompanied the
Five Year Plan,

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:16.166
that is 1928 to 1933,
and would be themselves victims

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:20.298
of the purges as we'll see.
 

00:12:20.298 --> 00:12:25.048
The tragedy of the Russian
Revolution.

00:12:25.048 --> 00:12:28.356
There's a quote in there
from--I guess it was somebody in

00:12:28.356 --> 00:12:31.309
the Red Army who said,
"Did we do all this?

00:12:31.309 --> 00:12:32.918
Did we fight in the civil war?
 

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:36.475
Did we try to save the
revolution against some really

00:12:36.475 --> 00:12:40.371
basically horrible legions and
the white armies during the

00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:41.330
civil war?
 

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:45.428
Did we save the revolution in
order to round up Kulaks,

00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:48.200
and put them in the middle of a
field,

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:51.408
and line them up in the middle
of a field,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:54.389
and gun them down with machine
guns to kill them?

00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:58.485
Did we do all of this to
eliminate from the face of the

00:12:58.485 --> 00:13:02.589
earth these people who had,
despite being relatively

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:05.740
privileged,
had struggled,

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.720
and had managed to survive the
whole thing?"

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.940
Sadly, the answer is yes.
 

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.639
It came to that.
 

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:14.729
The question is:
To what extent was this

00:13:14.729 --> 00:13:19.798
automatically--was this part of
the system from the beginning?

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:23.850
I'll give you some examples
that Holquist cites in a minute.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:31.888
He says you can see this coming
if you look at the first years

00:13:31.888 --> 00:13:34.918
of the Soviet people.
 

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:41.288
Let me give you some examples
of this.

00:13:41.288 --> 00:13:51.509
This is before the period where
Stalin becomes a success.

00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:59.450
Stalin worked very hard to make
it seem--as Lenin had one stroke

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:07.013
and then another--Stalin tried
to keep access closed to other

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.399
people.
 

00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:13.830
He worked feverishly to make it
seem that Stalin was the chosen

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:15.668
successor of Lenin.
 

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:21.566
There are some famous doctored
photographs where Stalin has had

00:14:21.566 --> 00:14:27.059
himself inserted next to Lenin,
in famous poses of Lenin,

00:14:27.059 --> 00:14:30.259
who was a pretty good speaker,
but nothing like Trotsky.

00:14:30.259 --> 00:14:31.835
Trotsky, with Jean
Jaurès,

00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:34.149
was the greatest orator of the
entire period.

00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:36.519
But Lenin wasn't too bad.
 

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:41.245
Stalin literally had himself
stuck into pictures where he

00:14:41.245 --> 00:14:42.678
would be there.
 

00:14:42.678 --> 00:14:48.152
He also took some of Lenin's
writings and sort of

00:14:48.152 --> 00:14:53.625
"updated"
them to make it seem like the

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:56.019
mantle was there.
 

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:59.240
As everybody knows who follows
this stuff at all,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:05.610
Lenin was, in his final days,
most concerned that comrade

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:10.158
Stalin's leadership was
potentially very dangerous.

00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:17.399
He expressed those fears in the
letter,

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:20.081
if I remember correctly,
written with a very shaky hand

00:15:20.081 --> 00:15:23.620
of a man who had a stroke,
a very serious stroke,

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.288
and who was close to death.
 

00:15:26.288 --> 00:15:32.139
He had his doubts about comrade
Stalin, not exactly from the

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:33.330
beginning.
 

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:38.529
Also, it's important to note
that Trotsky--whom as I said the

00:15:38.529 --> 00:15:43.557
other day would finally be
tracked down and assassinated in

00:15:43.557 --> 00:15:48.672
a garden in Mexico City--the
differences between Trotsky and

00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:51.620
Stalin went beyond ideology.
 

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.991
Trotsky, in what became known
as the "left

00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:58.071
opposition,"
that was pushing for more

00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:01.663
active instigation of
revolutions in other places,

00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:05.990
and, ironically,
was pushing even more for

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:09.370
collectivization even early on.
 

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.028
But it went more than that.
 

00:16:12.028 --> 00:16:14.926
There was a rivalry between two
men who both were

00:16:14.926 --> 00:16:17.220
extraordinarily sure of
themselves,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:24.365
and who thought that they were
the person who should first

00:16:24.365 --> 00:16:26.190
save,
and then lead,

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.418
the Soviet Union.
 

00:16:28.418 --> 00:16:34.120
Trotsky's role in the Red Army
as a strategist was extremely

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.279
important.
 

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.908
But there was more than that
also.

00:16:36.908 --> 00:16:43.618
There was more than a small
trace of anti-Semitism in

00:16:43.618 --> 00:16:44.779
Stalin.
 

00:16:44.779 --> 00:16:47.221
When he would refer to
"cosmopolitan

00:16:47.221 --> 00:16:49.538
enemies,"
and things like that.

00:16:49.538 --> 00:16:54.046
Cosmopolitanism was sort of a
code word for Jews,

00:16:54.046 --> 00:16:57.519
for Jewish people within the
party.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:59.288
There was more than that to
that.

00:16:59.288 --> 00:17:05.257
Trotsky is expelled from the
party, and then finally is

00:17:05.257 --> 00:17:08.130
tracked down and killed.
 

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.200
Some of these that you know
from reading Orwell,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.887
some of these factions and
these differences play

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:16.689
themselves out in this
anticipation of World War II

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:18.650
that was the Spanish Civil War.
 

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:23.271
The followers of Trotsky are a
very important faction in the

00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:24.838
Spanish Civil War.
 

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:28.902
You know from reading Orwell
the role of the Stalinists in

00:17:28.902 --> 00:17:29.900
all of this.
 

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:35.726
Just a few things before I turn
to Holquist's argument about how

00:17:35.726 --> 00:17:40.348
you can see some of the horrors
coming early on.

00:17:40.348 --> 00:17:47.000
Let me just define Stalinism as
a term.

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:53.997
It's a set of tenets,
policies, and practices that

00:17:53.997 --> 00:17:56.930
characterize the Soviet
government during the period

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.538
when Stalin is in power.
 

00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:04.713
Stalinism lasts until Stalin
finally dies--when is it?

00:18:04.713 --> 00:18:05.529
1953.
 

00:18:05.529 --> 00:18:07.269
That is when Stalin dies.
 

00:18:07.269 --> 00:18:13.330
The beginning of the Five Year
Plan, that is 1928 to 1933,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.009
is really the real beginning of
Stalinism.

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:21.390
You can anticipate some of
this, as we'll see in a minute.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:26.941
Stalinism not only takes a sort
of democratic centralism of

00:18:26.941 --> 00:18:31.121
decision making,
but what it does is it employs

00:18:31.121 --> 00:18:33.973
state coercion,
and more than this,

00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:38.390
state terror,
with the goal of transforming

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:45.273
this still relatively backward
society into a Soviet state that

00:18:45.273 --> 00:18:49.738
could sustain itself,
that could build heavy

00:18:49.738 --> 00:18:50.660
industries.
 

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:55.298
This was the obsession of
Stalin and Stalinism,

00:18:55.298 --> 00:18:57.960
that heavy industries would
have to be built,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.500
and that they would be built on
the backs of the peasantry,

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:06.230
who would lose their land and
become industrial workers.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:09.594
There's a massive urbanization,
as we'll see,

00:19:09.594 --> 00:19:12.730
in the Soviet Union during this
period.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:16.269
The obvious central
characteristics of Stalinism,

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:19.671
as you've already seen,
are the abolition of private

00:19:19.671 --> 00:19:23.609
property, first of all,
and the end of free trade,

00:19:23.609 --> 00:19:24.880
the end of the market.
 

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.660
The market is to disappear.
 

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:32.759
If you're abolishing private
property in a vast,

00:19:32.759 --> 00:19:36.647
vast state,
in which two generations before

00:19:36.647 --> 00:19:40.430
you still had serfs,
what you want to do from their

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.440
point of view is collectivize
agriculture.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.220
The massive collectivization of
agriculture.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.662
This would, as you know,
become a characteristic of the

00:19:51.662 --> 00:19:55.906
satellite states in Eastern
Europe and Eastern Central

00:19:55.906 --> 00:20:01.519
Europe with varying degrees,
varying degrees in those states.

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:03.568
The economy is planned.
 

00:20:03.568 --> 00:20:10.030
It's run in a centralized
fashion and predicated upon mass

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.338
industries, rapid
industrialization.

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:21.326
Part of this was the
liquidation--not a nice word--of

00:20:21.326 --> 00:20:26.163
those "exploiting
classes,"

00:20:26.163 --> 00:20:32.209
that is the bourgeois,
the NEPmen, the Kulaks,

00:20:32.209 --> 00:20:38.318
the aristocrats,
and the clergy.

00:20:38.318 --> 00:20:42.587
This involves deporting people
to the gulags,

00:20:42.587 --> 00:20:48.603
or incarcerating them wherever
they were, or incarcerating them

00:20:48.603 --> 00:20:50.349
in the gulags.
 

00:20:50.349 --> 00:20:56.096
The purge, the terror,
the political terror against

00:20:56.096 --> 00:20:59.830
alleged enemies,
including those who disagreed

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:03.930
with Stalin within the
leadership of the Soviet Union.

00:21:03.930 --> 00:21:08.153
Thus, the purges that you can
read about of the left

00:21:08.153 --> 00:21:12.707
opposition of Zinoviev and
Trotsky, and Bukharin's right

00:21:12.707 --> 00:21:13.950
opposition.
 

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:19.400
With this comes the cult of
personality.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:25.853
Stalin himself becomes,
and I say this in quotes,

00:21:25.853 --> 00:21:30.288
"a czar-like figure."
 

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:35.298
There are still truck drivers
in Russia who have pictures of

00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:39.630
Stalin in their trucks,
and other people as well.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.917
This leads, obviously,
to kind of half-baked political

00:21:43.917 --> 00:21:48.609
scientists' interpretations,
"Well, you have a czarist

00:21:48.609 --> 00:21:49.420
state.
 

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.519
You have an autocracy.
 

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:54.232
Inevitably it becomes another
autocracy with a czar-like

00:21:54.232 --> 00:21:57.609
figure, the cult of personality
of Stalin."

00:21:57.609 --> 00:22:00.239
When you think of Mao's China,
and there the cult of

00:22:00.239 --> 00:22:03.344
personality, if anything,
was even more than that with

00:22:03.344 --> 00:22:06.230
the Little Red Book and
all of this business.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:11.900
To repeat the obvious,
the Soviet Union was the

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.180
dictatorship of the Communist
Party,

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:19.457
and the dictatorship of the
Communist Party was the

00:22:19.457 --> 00:22:25.521
dictatorship of Joseph Stalin,
and the paranoia of Joseph

00:22:25.521 --> 00:22:26.519
Stalin.
 

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:30.787
Now, ironically,
Stalin, as I'm sure you know,

00:22:30.787 --> 00:22:36.458
was not Russian,
even though the Soviet Empire,

00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:40.516
and it was that,
was largely run in the interest

00:22:40.516 --> 00:22:41.859
of Russia and Russians.
 

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:44.348
Stalin was a Georgian.
 

00:22:44.348 --> 00:22:49.590
He was from the country in
which all these things have

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:54.240
happened in just the last five
or six months.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.910
He started out as a seminary
student.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.980
He was expelled for reading
Marxist tracts.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.720
Like a lot of these people,
he took aliases,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:08.200
because he robbed banks to get
money for the Bolshevik party.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.920
Stalin means in Russian
"man of steel."

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.009
That was his alias.
 

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:16.859
That wasn't his original name.
 

00:23:16.859 --> 00:23:19.809
Remember, he's a Georgian.
 

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:21.759
As I just said,
he becomes the administrator,

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:26.191
the Commissar of Nationalities,
but determined to snap the head

00:23:26.191 --> 00:23:32.114
off of the "hydra,"
of the danger of nationalist

00:23:32.114 --> 00:23:34.920
revival in these states.
 

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.623
Communism, in theory,
was antithetical to

00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:41.026
nationalism;
although, ironically,

00:23:41.026 --> 00:23:43.290
as you all know,
it doesn't really work that

00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:43.660
way.
 

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:48.394
There were strongly nationalist
communist states that still

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:51.170
retained--Hungary,
for example,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.328
or Czechoslovakia that
retained,

00:23:56.328 --> 00:23:58.630
even within the satellite
nature,

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:04.125
kind of a pride in trying to
make it work even in 1968,

00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:07.960
as Dubcek,
before the tanks roll into

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:12.330
Prague,
tries to make a human-faced

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.519
socialism with a Czech and
Slovak face.

00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:21.190
Of course, it doesn't work.
 

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.109
Through the whole period,
as everybody knows,

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:28.140
they execute millions of
people.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.454
In World War II,
the figures of the number of

00:24:31.454 --> 00:24:35.901
Soviets who die in World War II
is about twenty-five million

00:24:35.901 --> 00:24:36.730
people.
 

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.068
If you're thinking about
Stalingrad,

00:24:39.068 --> 00:24:41.210
and thinking about the siege of
Leningrad,

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:46.970
which goes on and on and on and
takes a million lives,

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.240
but within that twenty-five
million,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:51.130
lots of those people are people
who died in the gulags.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.568
They did not die from reasons
of war.

00:24:54.568 --> 00:24:58.732
They died in the gulags,
and many of them were executed

00:24:58.732 --> 00:25:01.586
for being a Kulak,
or being a NEP man,

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:02.819
or whatever.
 

00:25:02.819 --> 00:25:04.950
Can you see this coming?
 

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.358
Can one see this coming?
 

00:25:07.358 --> 00:25:09.160
Just a couple of points along
the way.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.934
During World War I,
states had increased their

00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:17.123
power,
their ability to control what

00:25:17.123 --> 00:25:22.625
became sort of command economies
to mobilize the resources of the

00:25:22.625 --> 00:25:23.400
state.
 

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.369
In Russia in World War I,
the imperial government,

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:31.623
Holquist writes,
"initiated a deportation

00:25:31.623 --> 00:25:34.960
of â€˜the Jewish
element'--remember,

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:40.165
the rabid anti-Semitism of the
czar and Alexandra--;"on

00:25:40.165 --> 00:25:43.342
the borderlines as
â€˜pernicious,

00:25:43.342 --> 00:25:45.929
harmful,
and dangerous to the Russian

00:25:45.929 --> 00:25:52.357
people,'"
and thus in wartime they are,

00:25:52.357 --> 00:25:55.868
just as in Italy.
 

00:25:55.868 --> 00:25:59.186
Italy went to war in part so
that they had the idea that they

00:25:59.186 --> 00:26:02.006
could somehow make citizens
Italian, feel themselves

00:26:02.006 --> 00:26:02.670
Italian.
 

00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:07.123
There is this nature as the war
is being fought in Russia that

00:26:07.123 --> 00:26:10.992
you will increase the
Russianness of the effort of the

00:26:10.992 --> 00:26:12.741
empire,
even though all these other

00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:15.769
nationalities are involved,
by excluding people,

00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:17.759
by excluding people.
 

00:26:17.759 --> 00:26:22.011
They're not excluding people by
putting them up on the wall and

00:26:22.011 --> 00:26:23.108
shooting them.
 

00:26:23.108 --> 00:26:30.990
Nonetheless,
the language is somewhat there.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:33.221
For example,
they describe the Whites,

00:26:33.221 --> 00:26:35.394
who were a nasty group,
many of them,

00:26:35.394 --> 00:26:37.445
and just nasty,
bloodthirsty group,

00:26:37.445 --> 00:26:39.858
not all of them,
but many of them.

00:26:39.858 --> 00:26:47.430
They describe the Jews as
"microbes."

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.894
This is the Whites describing
the Jews as "microbes"

00:26:51.894 --> 00:26:55.480
and Bolshevism as a
"social disease."

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.590
The kind of disease metaphors,
the next step is if you have a

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.880
disease, if you have a cancer,
you cut it out.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.490
You exclude it by cutting it
out.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:10.430
The language of exclusion is
already there.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:15.171
At one point the Soviets,
in the very first part of the

00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:17.855
Soviet Union,
began a program of what they

00:27:17.855 --> 00:27:20.048
called
"dekazakhization."

00:27:20.048 --> 00:27:22.894
They want to remove an entire
Kazakh population,

00:27:22.894 --> 00:27:25.740
which they viewed as
potentially disloyal to the

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.650
revolution.
 

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.048
But you can't do that.
 

00:27:28.048 --> 00:27:32.561
It's just too hard to do that
when all these other things are

00:27:32.561 --> 00:27:35.118
going on, so they can't do that.
 

00:27:35.118 --> 00:27:37.392
In the early years,
the Lenin years,

00:27:37.392 --> 00:27:39.338
you still find these things.
 

00:27:39.338 --> 00:27:43.200
In 1920, when there's a
campaign against banditism,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.253
that is bandits or people who
don't support the

00:27:46.253 --> 00:27:49.640
Communists--that term is often
used, by the way,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:54.440
in France under Vichy,
that the resistors are bandits,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.890
or they're terrorists, etc. etc.
 

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.440
Bandits become a dangerous
epidemic.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.548
Again, the disease metaphor.
 

00:28:01.548 --> 00:28:04.710
They're dangerous because they
are.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:09.440
In 1920, Stalin informed
Trotsky, Holquist found,

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.234
that an order would soon come
directing "the total

00:28:13.234 --> 00:28:16.680
extermination of the White
officer corps."

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.670
Of course, total extermination
is pretty strong language.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:25.880
That's not just simply putting
people in jail or in a

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.500
re-education camp.
 

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.380
That is getting rid of them.
 

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.471
They create camps which were
called "filter

00:28:32.471 --> 00:28:35.038
spaces,"
where people could be kept

00:28:35.038 --> 00:28:38.000
until they had seen the light,
etc., etc.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.328
They had all these White
prisoners, some of whom

00:28:43.328 --> 00:28:50.700
executed, and the Cheka are the
police who oversee all of this.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:52.519
That's an obvious term.
 

00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:57.670
Examples from the civil war,
in Holquist's words,

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.490
"show the project of
fashioning society by excising

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:05.518
particular elements was an
intrinsic aspect of Soviet power

00:29:05.518 --> 00:29:07.880
from the very beginning."
 

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:10.858
But it's not on the scale that
would come later.

00:29:10.858 --> 00:29:18.512
There are lists of people drawn
up in the early 1920s that would

00:29:18.512 --> 00:29:24.710
be used in 1937 and 1938,
during the Great Purge.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.779
So, when the campaigns of
collectivization,

00:29:28.779 --> 00:29:31.838
which are bloody,
which are massacres,

00:29:31.838 --> 00:29:38.078
come along,
the dekulakization campaign,

00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:41.348
get rid of the Kulaks,
in 1929-1930,

00:29:41.348 --> 00:29:46.200
becomes on a more urgent and
more paranoid scale.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.690
This is the kind of stuff that
we now know from the archives.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.719
A memorandum from March 15 1931
states that with regard to the

00:29:53.719 --> 00:29:56.016
Kulaks,
the goal of deportation from

00:29:56.016 --> 00:29:59.700
all regions was "to totally
cleanse them of Kulaks."

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.080
Another, slightly earlier,
in February,

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.338
calls for them to be
"immediately liquidated.

00:30:05.338 --> 00:30:09.500
We will exile the Kulak by
thousands and when necessary

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.349
shoot the Kulak breed.
 

00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:13.640
We will make soap of the Kulaks.
 

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.661
Our class enemy must be wiped
off from the face of the

00:30:16.661 --> 00:30:17.460
earth."
 

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.180
Strong language.
 

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.553
Thus, in 1930,
more than 20,000 Kulaks were

00:30:22.553 --> 00:30:24.240
sentenced to death.
 

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.509
Many more are gunned down when
they protest.

00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:28.650
And they protest.
 

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:33.836
They kill their animals rather
than turn them over to the

00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:35.039
commissars.
 

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:38.809
They burn their harvest.
 

00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:40.048
They burn their farm.
 

00:30:40.048 --> 00:30:43.712
These are "weapons of the
weak," as my dear friend,

00:30:43.712 --> 00:30:46.460
Jim Scott in the political
science department,

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.559
would call it.
 

00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:49.358
Weak indeed they were.
 

00:30:49.358 --> 00:30:53.710
They're confronting these
enormous military forces.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.700
But they fight back.
 

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:55.750
They fight back.
 

00:30:55.750 --> 00:31:05.759
They just don't go down in a
heap without fighting.

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:10.730
One of the interesting things
about this is just as one of the

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:15.048
key trends in the end of the
nineteenth century is the

00:31:15.048 --> 00:31:18.880
origins of
sociology--intellectual trends,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.390
the idea of counting,
and figuring,

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:23.170
and thinking about contemporary
society,

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:26.480
Max Weber and all that.
 

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.200
Really important stuff,
positivism and all of this.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.259
These kinds of censuses
developed way before all this.

00:31:36.259 --> 00:31:39.548
The first really accurate
census in France,

00:31:39.548 --> 00:31:42.680
outside of municipal ones,
is in 1941.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:48.132
But what they do is they use
sort of modern tools of

00:31:48.132 --> 00:31:52.087
censuses, surveys,
and questionnaires,

00:31:52.087 --> 00:31:57.220
to get information on the
entire population.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.987
You'd better be damn careful
when you write down who you are

00:32:00.987 --> 00:32:02.519
on one of these forms.
 

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:03.553
When they say,
"Who is your

00:32:03.553 --> 00:32:04.220
grandfather?"
 

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:06.359
"What did your grandfather
do?"

00:32:06.359 --> 00:32:09.118
What are you going to write?
 

00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:13.309
You can't write down he was an
industrial worker if he wasn't.

00:32:13.309 --> 00:32:15.119
What if he's a Kulak?
 

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:17.099
What if he's a noble?
 

00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:20.359
What if he's an Orthodox priest?
 

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:22.950
You're guilty by association.
 

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:26.602
Once a Kulak,
once a clergyman,

00:32:26.602 --> 00:32:31.960
once an aristocrat,
by class identity you are

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.299
guilty.
 

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:34.920
You are guilty.
 

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:42.150
They used the censuses of 1926,
and 1937,

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.740
and the last one before the war
of 1939,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:49.362
as a way of deciding who should
get passports and who shouldn't

00:32:49.362 --> 00:32:55.127
get passports,
and who should be sent off to

00:32:55.127 --> 00:32:56.680
wherever.
 

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:03.508
By 1934, twenty-seven million
people in the Soviet Union had

00:33:03.508 --> 00:33:08.368
been monitored and given state
ID cards.

00:33:08.368 --> 00:33:10.740
The French, you had to have an
ID card, also,

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.588
to go from one department to
the next,

00:33:12.588 --> 00:33:17.864
to go from Marseilles to Nice
you had to have an internal

00:33:17.864 --> 00:33:18.900
passport.
 

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.440
What they do,
it's the same state thrust,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.069
except that it has a murderous
outcome.

00:33:26.069 --> 00:33:30.480
If you're classifying people,
if you're counting people,

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.173
if you're registering people,
this is way before "the

00:33:34.173 --> 00:33:36.221
quiet violence of the
computer,"

00:33:36.221 --> 00:33:38.440
as Michelle Perrot memorably
put it.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:44.079
The outcome is very different.
 

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:45.380
They use archivists.
 

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.950
Some of my friends were
archivists.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:48.470
They're not going to be doing
this kind of thing.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.670
These are French archivists.
 

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.808
But they're using archivists
who are fearful for their lives.

00:33:54.808 --> 00:33:58.873
If you're an archivist with
writing and reading skills,

00:33:58.873 --> 00:34:03.387
you're potentially an enemy of
the state, because you're from

00:34:03.387 --> 00:34:05.420
the wrong social class.
 

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:09.510
They say, "We want to look
at your archives.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.181
We want you to find out who's
in what category in your

00:34:13.181 --> 00:34:14.219
region."
 

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:15.989
You better do it.
 

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:19.855
Archivists in 1939,
according to Holquist,

00:34:19.855 --> 00:34:23.719
identify 108,000 enemies of the
people.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:29.563
Once you're classified as an
enemy of the people,

00:34:29.563 --> 00:34:32.000
baby you're toast.
 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.260
That's it.
 

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.940
You're toast.
 

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:42.210
Sheila Fitzpatrick is a
wonderful historian.

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:48.349
She was one of the first to
study what she calls "the

00:34:48.349 --> 00:34:53.518
extraordinary everydayness"
of Stalinism.

00:34:53.518 --> 00:34:59.469
What was life like in a place
where the only way of getting

00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:03.612
anything,
and potentially the only way of

00:35:03.612 --> 00:35:07.070
surviving,
is your relationship to a

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.030
bureaucratic figure?
 

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:13.364
Stalinism, the essence of state
collectivization,

00:35:13.364 --> 00:35:17.791
of state totalitarianism,
is you have to have this

00:35:17.791 --> 00:35:20.050
enormous bureaucracy.
 

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:26.119
It's the bureaucracy that calls
the shots.

00:35:35.429 --> 00:35:42.039
Let me put some of the points
that are important.

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:46.168
In getting by,
who are apt to be the militants

00:35:46.168 --> 00:35:47.730
in all of this?
 

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:52.128
Who are apt to be the true
believers in all of this,

00:35:52.128 --> 00:35:56.960
the most loyal to the project
of creating this new world,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.980
this new world that never came?
 

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:04.960
The answer is young people,
younger people.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:09.402
There were many cases of
younger people denouncing their

00:36:09.402 --> 00:36:13.360
parents, being asked to denounce
their parents.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.931
But the most militant and the
most faithful were people who

00:36:17.931 --> 00:36:21.480
had not,
who in the 1930s, for example,

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.849
if they were twenty-five years
old,

00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:24.949
they didn't really remember the
old regime.

00:36:24.949 --> 00:36:27.829
They didn't remember the
czarist autocracy.

00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:31.889
They are more likely to think
that there's nothing wrong with

00:36:31.889 --> 00:36:36.289
trying to decide who still has
religious icons on their walls,

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:41.969
whose parents religiously went
to church.

00:36:41.969 --> 00:36:50.936
The young people were more apt
to be the militants in all of

00:36:50.936 --> 00:36:52.000
this.
 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.702
If you were a militant,
what you did was you denounced

00:36:54.702 --> 00:36:57.170
class enemies,
these Kulaks and the priests,

00:36:57.170 --> 00:37:00.150
members of the
pre-revolutionary nobility,

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:01.639
former capitalists.
 

00:37:01.639 --> 00:37:04.579
Again, once a capitalist,
you are always a capitalist.

00:37:04.579 --> 00:37:07.329
Once a Kulak,
you are always a Kulak.

00:37:07.329 --> 00:37:12.695
People who had been declared as
"non-toilers,"

00:37:12.695 --> 00:37:17.574
that is people who are not
really workers or really

00:37:17.574 --> 00:37:20.000
peasants,
who are Kulaks,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.963
they are deprived of the vote,
not that elections subsequently

00:37:23.963 --> 00:37:25.880
meant anything in the Soviet
Union,

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.940
as early as the constitution of
1918.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:36.768
These young militants undertake
a war on bourgeois specialists.

00:37:36.768 --> 00:37:39.751
One of the problems with the
campaign for rapid

00:37:39.751 --> 00:37:42.539
industrialization is they're
really torn.

00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:45.012
You need these bourgeois
specialists, because they're

00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:45.679
technocrats.
 

00:37:45.679 --> 00:37:51.119
They're the ones that have to
keep up the production count.

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.190
They have to keep it up there.
 

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.047
Then you go into this period
and you say, "You can't

00:37:54.047 --> 00:37:55.509
have a bunch of bourgeois
specialists who are

00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:56.139
educated."
 

00:37:56.139 --> 00:38:00.086
So, those people get
liquidated, maybe not killed but

00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:01.150
get removed.
 

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:03.855
Then they will bring in and
replace them with peasants who

00:38:03.855 --> 00:38:06.512
sometimes had absolutely no
education, which is not their

00:38:06.512 --> 00:38:07.320
fault at all.
 

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.409
The Soviets do educate people
in this period.

00:38:10.409 --> 00:38:13.239
There's a huge increase in
literacy in this period.

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:16.860
But they're turning over
important management positions

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:19.822
within the Soviet Union,
in this push for rapid

00:38:19.822 --> 00:38:21.974
industrialization,
to people who can't read and

00:38:21.974 --> 00:38:25.007
write,
and really just don't have the

00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:29.449
kind of finesse or the kind of
ability to do it.

00:38:29.449 --> 00:38:32.739
That causes all sorts of
problems.

00:38:32.739 --> 00:38:37.989
The bureaucracy is increasingly
filled with people who are not

00:38:37.989 --> 00:38:42.980
competent, but are there because
of their party loyalty.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.000
If you weren't loyal to the
party, there was nowhere you

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.389
were going to go.
 

00:38:48.389 --> 00:38:51.000
How does this affect ordinary
Soviet citizens?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.039
There's constant propaganda,
talk about the radiant future,

00:38:55.039 --> 00:38:59.150
that enormous sacrifices now
will be worth it in the end.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.835
Marx, after all,
said scientific socialism is

00:39:02.835 --> 00:39:05.179
going to take a long time.
 

00:39:05.179 --> 00:39:10.335
Thus, if you see these,
and I've been in the Moscow

00:39:10.335 --> 00:39:15.905
subway a long time ago,
but these sort of heroic murals

00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:20.340
of the Soviet worker,
the Stakhanovite.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:21.119
Don't write it down.
 

00:39:21.119 --> 00:39:23.929
I think he's in the book,
but this guy,

00:39:23.929 --> 00:39:26.978
Stakhanov,
was a guy who had apparently

00:39:26.978 --> 00:39:31.753
set a world record by extracting
the most coal any human had ever

00:39:31.753 --> 00:39:32.349
done.
 

00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:33.619
It was basically made up.
 

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:36.289
But he became this kind of
image of hard work.

00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:38.748
I'll tell you,
you'll see a lot of these art

00:39:38.748 --> 00:39:40.750
deco murals in Detroit,
Michigan.

00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:44.097
Or, for example,
I'm not making this as an

00:39:44.097 --> 00:39:46.179
analogy,
but there was the equivalent

00:39:46.179 --> 00:39:48.090
under National Socialism,
also,

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.420
the idea of the German worker
toiling away and all that,

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:53.289
with the interests of the state.
 

00:39:53.289 --> 00:39:57.623
Basically it's the idea that
Russia could be moved by hard

00:39:57.623 --> 00:40:01.730
work out of backwardness toward
this radiant future.

00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:05.690
It does keep people going.
 

00:40:05.690 --> 00:40:08.266
There's always this contrast
between "then,"

00:40:08.266 --> 00:40:10.989
the bad old days when these
folks ruled--the NEP men,

00:40:10.989 --> 00:40:13.760
and the Kulaks,
and the aristocracy,

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.690
and all of that--and the
inevitable future.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.360
The landlords were gone.
 

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.304
There's collective ownership of
the means of production,

00:40:22.304 --> 00:40:24.179
so everything has got to be
okay.

00:40:24.179 --> 00:40:27.266
The motto is,
"The party is always

00:40:27.266 --> 00:40:30.760
right," and you'd better
believe it.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:37.309
The state shaped the way people
lived.

00:40:37.309 --> 00:40:42.570
Part of it, those people lived
through the purge.

00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:44.849
I'll tell you a story.
 

00:40:44.849 --> 00:40:49.219
I had this colleague a long,
long time ago when I first came

00:40:49.219 --> 00:40:52.329
here who grew up in Moscow in
the 1930s.

00:40:52.329 --> 00:40:56.809
His father was the Persian
ambassador to Moscow.

00:40:56.809 --> 00:41:00.860
In the purges people were now
seeing their parents,

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.820
and people were being taken
away in the night,

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.369
and there were boots in the
hall,

00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:06.130
and it was a pretty damn scary
time to live.

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.969
One day he was in this big
school.

00:41:07.969 --> 00:41:09.650
He was in
collège,

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:10.518
middle school.
 

00:41:10.518 --> 00:41:12.590
He's twelve years old,
basically.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.646
He is sitting in one of these
big buildings there,

00:41:15.646 --> 00:41:19.389
and the bell rings to go from
one class to the next class.

00:41:19.389 --> 00:41:23.474
The bell rang and the guy who
was sitting in front of him,

00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:25.840
a twelve-year-old boy,
gets up.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.976
He puts his cartable
down, his book carrier down,

00:41:29.976 --> 00:41:31.329
and he goes out.
 

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.420
They're on the fifth floor.
 

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.092
He goes to the stairwell and he
jumps over to his death,

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:35.920
just like that.
 

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.730
He stepped over the thing and
fell.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.139
If you're twelve years old
you're going to remember that

00:41:41.139 --> 00:41:41.550
kind of thing.
 

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:44.893
He didn't know,
because you didn't discuss such

00:41:44.893 --> 00:41:46.768
things,
whether he had denounced his

00:41:46.768 --> 00:41:49.793
parents and felt badly about it,
or whether his parents had been

00:41:49.793 --> 00:41:52.260
taken away and he didn't have
any idea where they were.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:55.969
This was one of the tragedies
also.

00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:59.889
A lot of it is self-deception.
 

00:41:59.889 --> 00:42:02.949
These were very poor people.
 

00:42:02.949 --> 00:42:04.739
You believe in the radiant
future.

00:42:04.739 --> 00:42:07.210
This is a very, very poor place.
 

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.639
You saw these Stalin
skyscrapers.

00:42:09.639 --> 00:42:12.972
There's a big debate in Warsaw
whether the one that's there

00:42:12.972 --> 00:42:13.949
should be kept.
 

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:16.199
You saw more literacy.
 

00:42:16.199 --> 00:42:19.659
You saw sometimes products on
the market.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:21.719
But the deception was there.
 

00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:23.469
The great hopes were there.
 

00:42:23.469 --> 00:42:25.170
The reality was completely
different.

00:42:25.170 --> 00:42:26.949
You would have bizarre things
happen.

00:42:26.949 --> 00:42:28.590
Suddenly, you have state
planning.

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:32.367
For a while there were all
these red female stockings on

00:42:32.367 --> 00:42:33.260
the market.
 

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:34.489
That was supposed to be cool.
 

00:42:34.489 --> 00:42:37.492
You had a lot of Western
visitors who had seen these same

00:42:37.492 --> 00:42:39.800
female red stockings,
which were very much

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.639
"in"
in Paris and Berlin.

00:42:41.639 --> 00:42:43.190
But this wasn't Paris and
Berlin.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.550
This was Moscow.
 

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.880
Suddenly, you have a lot of
that.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:48.146
Someone thought,
"Ketchup will look good to

00:42:48.146 --> 00:42:49.929
the outsiders when they
come."

00:42:49.929 --> 00:42:51.570
So, they start producing
ketchup.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.929
There's nothing to put the
ketchup on.

00:42:52.929 --> 00:42:55.460
The most ridiculous example
I've ever heard is that they

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.210
started producing lots of
bathtubs,

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:59.210
because people are waiting in
line to get apartments,

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:01.110
which was true until 1992.
 

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.132
They're waiting in line to get
apartments, though things got a

00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:07.969
lot better after World War II,
but still.

00:43:07.969 --> 00:43:10.947
If you're going to have an
apartment that is of progress,

00:43:10.947 --> 00:43:13.659
the radiant future,
you've got to have a bathtub.

00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:17.755
So, they produce all these
bathtubs, but they forget to

00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:19.880
produce corks or stoppers.
 

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.641
So, for a long time you had
people that were lucky enough to

00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:24.746
have bathtubs,
but the water just runs out and

00:43:24.746 --> 00:43:26.900
they could show them off to
their friends.

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.880
It simply doesn't work.
 

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.300
But there is the illusion,
and I'm going to have to end

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.320
with this, because I went too
long earlier.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.860
There's more to say but there's
always more to say.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.289
There was the illusion.
 

00:43:39.289 --> 00:43:43.463
There were lots of true
believers and people who also

00:43:43.463 --> 00:43:45.550
wanted a radiant future.
 

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.592
In the late 1960s,
please, not the early ones,

00:43:50.592 --> 00:43:55.297
and the 1970s,
we were all dealing with our

00:43:55.297 --> 00:43:58.099
ideology of the weak.
 

00:43:58.099 --> 00:44:01.983
I had an uncle who meant a
great deal to me who was a

00:44:01.983 --> 00:44:02.880
communist.
 

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.099
He was trained in Berlin as a
psychoanalyst.

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:10.679
He worked for a Communist
newspaper, and he claimed to

00:44:10.679 --> 00:44:15.949
have know Georgie Dimitrov,
the Bulgarian communist leader.

00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:18.380
He was a true believer always.
 

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.536
At the end of his life he ended
up passing, or having his wife

00:44:21.536 --> 00:44:23.139
pass Save the Will petitions.
 

00:44:23.139 --> 00:44:25.469
He was no longer a communist.
 

00:44:25.469 --> 00:44:27.940
But I remember when I was a
little boy him telling me that

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:30.539
the people trying to escape from
communism were psychotic.

00:44:30.539 --> 00:44:33.914
That people trying to get over
the wall in Berlin were

00:44:33.914 --> 00:44:37.289
psychotic for trying to leave
this radiant future of a

00:44:37.289 --> 00:44:38.690
workers' paradise.
 

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:40.469
There were a lot of true
believers.

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:42.117
These people,
a lot of them,

00:44:42.117 --> 00:44:45.048
and I'm not dissing my uncle
whom I loved deeply,

00:44:45.048 --> 00:44:49.079
and who meant a great deal in
my life, and especially my aunt.

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:51.219
They believed.
 

00:44:51.219 --> 00:44:53.831
People would go to these show
trials and they would see people

00:44:53.831 --> 00:44:56.349
saying,
"Yes, I was in cahoots

00:44:56.349 --> 00:45:00.610
with Romanian fascists,"
or with Dutch fascists,

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:04.320
or with Georgian nationalists,
or something like that.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.161
They would admit to all sorts
of things, possibly hoping it

00:45:07.161 --> 00:45:08.730
was going to save their lives.
 

00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.280
It didn't. It never did.
 

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.320
They were executed.
 

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:13.079
Stalin executed them all.
 

00:45:13.079 --> 00:45:16.659
He executed the entire general
staff practically of the army.

00:45:16.659 --> 00:45:21.159
One of the most amazing things
about the Second World War is

00:45:21.159 --> 00:45:24.362
how the Red Army not only
survived but won,

00:45:24.362 --> 00:45:26.269
and retrained people.
 

00:45:26.269 --> 00:45:27.460
There weren't any admirals left.
 

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.800
There was nobody left.
 

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.869
He killed them all.
 

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:31.230
He killed them all.
 

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.559
But people continued to believe.
 

00:45:33.559 --> 00:45:35.199
They believed.
 

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.648
The whole phrase,
maybe you've heard of the

00:45:37.648 --> 00:45:40.039
phrase, "a Potemkin
village."

00:45:40.039 --> 00:45:43.820
I guess that's a good place to
end--a Potemkin village.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.414
For example,
if you're watching an old TV

00:45:45.414 --> 00:45:46.969
western and you see a
façade,

00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:50.000
you've got the bar,
and you've got Miss Kitty,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.088
and you've got all of this,
and a few people punching each

00:45:53.088 --> 00:45:55.019
other out;
there's nothing behind it.

00:45:55.019 --> 00:45:56.550
It's just all a fraud.
 

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.489
It's nothing.
 

00:45:57.489 --> 00:46:01.076
They would bring these visitors
from the West in this brave new

00:46:01.076 --> 00:46:03.737
industrial world,
and they'd see parts of towns

00:46:03.737 --> 00:46:05.300
that had been reshaped.
 

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:09.960
They meet the first literate
people in a family.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.880
It was very true.
 

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:14.510
Some good things happened, too.
 

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:17.559
But they were far outweighed by
the bad things.

00:46:17.559 --> 00:46:20.911
But a Potemkin village would
be, you'd go and you'd see this

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:23.469
façade and you'd be
whisked through.

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:25.827
"This is where the
children's railroad will

00:46:25.827 --> 00:46:26.380
be."
 

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.010
"This is where the
kindergarten is going to

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:30.860
be."
 

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.510
It's always the "going to
be," and it never happened.

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.659
That, I suppose,
is the tragedy of the Russian

00:46:37.659 --> 00:46:38.860
Revolution.
 

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:47.168
Arguably, maybe,
who knows, a good idea gone

00:46:47.168 --> 00:46:48.768
terribly, terribly bad.

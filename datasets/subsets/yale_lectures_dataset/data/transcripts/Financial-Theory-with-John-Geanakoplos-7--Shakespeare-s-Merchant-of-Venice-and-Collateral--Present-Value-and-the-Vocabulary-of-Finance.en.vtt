00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.000
So, so far where have we gotten
to?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.920
We started summarizing what
general equilibrium was.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.539
We saw that Irving Fisher of
Yale reinvented general

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.450
equilibrium in order to study
finance,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.105
and we saw just by
reinterpreting the variables of

00:00:19.105 --> 00:00:22.140
general equilibrium we could
start to say a lot of things

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.426
about finance,
and in particular we had the

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:28.944
idea of free markets,
an argument in favor of free

00:00:28.944 --> 00:00:29.480
markets.
 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.339
We had the idea of arbitrage
and no arbitrage so you could

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:36.793
deduce a lot of prices without
solving for the whole

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:40.450
equilibrium just by knowing what
other prices are.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.914
And we also learned that the
price of many things is going to

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:47.610
have to do with the utility and
marginal utilities of people,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.746
and that's going to have a lot
to do with what their impatience

00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:52.819
is,
and whether they're rich people

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:55.402
or poor people,
redistributions of wealth,

00:00:55.402 --> 00:00:58.875
who's got the money and how
impatient the people who have

00:00:58.875 --> 00:00:59.930
the money are.
 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.209
So those are the basic lessons
that we're going to now carry

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:04.209
into the course.
 

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.281
And so for several lectures now
I'm going to leave the abstract

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:12.155
theory of general equilibrium
and start teaching you some of

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:16.161
the basic vocabulary of finance
that you have to know and that

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.970
everybody in finance knows like
what is a mortgage,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.080
what's an annuity and stuff
like that.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.364
So before I go there,
though, I want to remind you of

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:33.360
what Shakespeare had done 300
years before Irving Fisher.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.302
So Irving Fisher,
remember, he cleared up the

00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:38.510
confusion of what interest was.
 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.069
He said interest is
crystallized impatience.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.420
It's not some horribly unjust
thing.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.578
It's not, as Marx thought,
exploitation,

00:01:47.578 --> 00:01:52.360
but Shakespeare had discovered
all this 300 years before.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.476
Now, when I was your age or a
little bit younger than you in

00:01:55.476 --> 00:01:58.910
high school we all had to read
the Merchant of Venice.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.140
I have two Indian coauthors who
are vaguely my age,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.091
maybe a little older,
but anyway they sort of grew up

00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:10.840
in India and they had to learn
the Merchant of Venice,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.550
and actually they learned it a
lot better than I did.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.438
They both have memorized the
Merchant of Venice.

00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:18.098
They can recite almost the
entire thing by heart.

00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:20.956
But anyway, when I was in high
school it was completely typical

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:22.938
to study the Merchant of
Venice.

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.008
I wonder how many of you have
actually read it.

00:02:25.008 --> 00:02:27.039
Who's read the Merchant of
Venice?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.430
Whoa this is Yale, I'm shocked.
 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.770
So a quarter of you have read
it.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.514
Well, I recommend to the other
three-quarters that you do read

00:02:35.514 --> 00:02:35.740
it.
 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.226
Now, when it's taught nowadays,
especially at Yale,

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:43.690
it's taught as a love story and
a commentary on anti-Semitism.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.098
Now, of course, it's both.
 

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.590
It is a love story and
commentary on anti-Semitism.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.669
Shylock the lender is Jewish.
 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.318
And remember what we heard
about the great religions?

00:02:54.318 --> 00:02:58.663
They were all forbidding
lending at interest except for

00:02:58.663 --> 00:03:03.408
Judaism which let you loan money
at interest to non-Jews.

00:03:03.408 --> 00:03:04.508
So Shakespeare [correction:
Shylock],

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:07.656
who's the money lender,
is Jewish and lending it to

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:11.181
Christians and that plays a big
role in the play and what

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:14.268
happens to him,
and what people say about

00:03:14.268 --> 00:03:17.120
Judaism is a big element of the
story.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.645
But the way the play is read
now that's the whole story,

00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:21.530
and I don't think it's the
whole story.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.068
In fact, I think it's quite an
unimportant part of the story.

00:03:24.068 --> 00:03:28.620
I think the heart of the story
is Shakespeare's commentary on

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.530
economics.
 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.470
And so I'm going to try and
argue in the next ten minutes

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.780
that Shakespeare was not only a
great writer,

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.300
a great psychologist,
but a great economist.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.466
And you're going to see that
almost all the elements of the

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:43.464
course are in this play,
and that if you read it the way

00:03:43.464 --> 00:03:47.006
I think you should read it,
it should be obvious that it's

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:50.039
really about economics and not
about love.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:52.288
So how do you know that?
 

00:03:52.288 --> 00:03:55.592
Well, the very first line of
the play, Antonio walks in and

00:03:55.592 --> 00:03:58.211
he says, "In sooth,
I know not why I am so

00:03:58.211 --> 00:03:59.008
sad."
 

00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:02.174
And there's an interlocutor,
a minor character,

00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:05.407
whose name I've forgotten,
Salario or something,

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:08.710
says well it must be that
you're so nervous.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.960
All your riches are on these
boats and they're at risk,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.245
and so anyone who had so much
money at risk on boats would

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.300
naturally be nervous and
therefore maybe depressed.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.120
And Antonio says,
no, no, no, no,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.363
I'm not worried about the boats
because every boat is on a

00:04:26.363 --> 00:04:28.810
different ocean and so I'm not
worried.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.346
They are on a different ocean
and they're sailing at different

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:31.680
times.
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.720
I'm not worried about my boats.
 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.918
And so then the interlocutor
says, well then you must be

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:38.139
worried about love.
 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.389
And he says,
no, no, that's not it at all.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:43.350
So what do we see at the very
beginning of the play?

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.889
It's business first,
love second;

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.569
and secondly,
he understands diversification.

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.490
Now, what is the plot of play?
 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.505
Bassanio, who Harold Bloom--so
it happens that went to talk to

00:05:01.505 --> 00:05:03.480
Harold Bloom--
I saw him in the Whitney

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.100
Humanities Center--
one of Yale's greatest scholars.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.803
He's a polymath,
he knows about everything,

00:05:09.803 --> 00:05:13.603
but including about Shakespeare
and he has a much advertised

00:05:13.603 --> 00:05:15.149
photographic memory.
 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:19.829
So I happened to run into him
at the Whitney Humanities

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:24.596
Center, actually in the men's
room of Whitney Humanities

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:25.550
Center.
 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.136
While we were there I asked him
about the Merchant of

00:05:29.136 --> 00:05:32.850
Venice and whether he
happened to remember the rate of

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.180
interest that Shylock ends of
charging Antonio,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.579
and he said, "Dear boy,
I remember almost everything,

00:05:41.579 --> 00:05:42.980
but that I've forgotten."
 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.480
It was so unimportant to him
that he didn't even remember the

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.589
rate of interest.
 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.288
But he said,
"I happen to be lecturing

00:05:49.288 --> 00:05:51.430
about the Merchant of
Venice in my class this

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.331
afternoon,"
so I went and heard his lecture

00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:54.990
on the Merchant of
Venice.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.125
So Bassanio,
who's one of the heroes of the

00:05:58.125 --> 00:06:02.160
play, according to Harold Bloom
is a complete loser.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.848
He's the one who needs the
money to woo Portia,

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:10.180
who's this beautiful woman
living outside of Venice.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.370
And so he's got to borrow a
huge amount of money.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.983
So when he enters he's
described as a Venetian,

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:16.459
a scholar and a soldier.
 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.815
Now, whenever Shakespeare says
a scholar and a soldier,

00:06:19.815 --> 00:06:23.360
sometimes it's not a Venetian,
when he says that the guy's

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.790
always a great guy.
 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.889
So this occurs repeatedly.
 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.689
So anyway, Bassanio comes in as
a star.

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.329
He's a Venetian,
a scholar, a soldier.

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:32.259
What more can you want to be?
 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.446
And so he needs the money to
woo Portia and he's got a

00:06:35.446 --> 00:06:36.949
business plan to do it.
 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.886
He's tried wooing her before
and it's come to nothing and

00:06:39.886 --> 00:06:41.040
he's lost his money.
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.596
But he says,
"If you shoot an arrow and

00:06:43.596 --> 00:06:45.836
you lose it,
shoot an arrow again the same

00:06:45.836 --> 00:06:48.577
way and then follow the second
arrow more closely and you'll

00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:50.759
figure out where the first arrow
goes."

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.230
So he's a man on a business
venture with a business plan.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.310
So here's Bassanio,
and here's Shylock and Antonio.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.045
Now, he needs 3,000 ducats and
he doesn't have any collateral

00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:05.149
or anything.
 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:09.500
And so he goes to Antonio,
who's an older man,

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.875
and according to Harold Bloom
there's some potential gay

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:16.434
relationship and maybe they're
lovers and maybe they're not

00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:17.110
lovers.
 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.339
That's half the lecture.
 

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:24.639
Anyway, so Shylock lends the
money,

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.192
3,000 ducats,
and it's so much money he has

00:07:27.192 --> 00:07:30.841
to borrow it from another money
lender named Tubal who's even

00:07:30.841 --> 00:07:32.180
richer than he is.
 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.779
So they argue over what the
interest rate has got to be.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:40.870
And so Antonio says--oh dear
I've forgotten to change this,

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.235
so this is out of order--so
they argue over what the

00:07:44.235 --> 00:07:47.932
interest rate should be and
Antonio and Shylock make this

00:07:47.932 --> 00:07:48.790
argument.
 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.870
Antonio says,
it's disgusting that you want

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.629
to charge me interest.
 

00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:55.459
I mean, good Christians never
charge interest.

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:56.449
I'm appalled at you.
 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:58.620
It's because you're Jewish
you're charging me interest.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.425
So he's throwing up epithets
and insults at Shylock,

00:08:01.425 --> 00:08:04.009
but really he just wants a low
interest rate.

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:06.884
And so he says,
Antonio says,

00:08:06.884 --> 00:08:10.975
"Shylock,
I would neither borrow nor lend

00:08:10.975 --> 00:08:15.055
by taking or giving interest,
but to supply the ripe wants of

00:08:15.055 --> 00:08:17.129
my friend I'll break a
custom."

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.737
So "ripe wants of my
friend" that's saying

00:08:19.737 --> 00:08:22.396
because Bassanio was so
impatient to get his hands on

00:08:22.396 --> 00:08:24.961
the money to find Portia,
she's going to get married if

00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:26.490
he doesn't hurry up and marry
her himself.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.802
Because of his impatience he's
willing to pay a high rate of

00:08:29.802 --> 00:08:30.420
interest.
 

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:34.923
And Shylock says you're always
complaining about me that I

00:08:34.923 --> 00:08:39.740
charge interest--I've left out a
whole bunch of stuff--but I'm

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.690
patient.
 

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.879
All of us are patient.
 

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:43.428
That's the badge of our tribe.
 

00:08:43.428 --> 00:08:46.690
We're patient and so that's why
I'm willing to lend you the

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:47.139
money.
 

00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:51.073
So here Shakespeare has laid
out, and it goes over five pages

00:08:51.073 --> 00:08:52.779
patience and impatience.
 

00:08:52.779 --> 00:09:03.230
So then they get an argument,
again, about interest.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.058
So I forgot a slide.
 

00:09:04.058 --> 00:09:07.759
So the argument is Shylock
tells a story.

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:11.452
He says even in the Bible,
you say that it's un-Christian

00:09:11.452 --> 00:09:15.057
to lend at interest,
but don't you know the story in

00:09:15.057 --> 00:09:17.750
the Bible where Jacob was asked
to do,

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.960
perform a service in the field,
using his fields.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.610
Somebody wanted to use his
fields for a while,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.038
and so Jacob said okay you can
use my fields but I have to

00:09:27.038 --> 00:09:30.590
charge you a fee and the fee's
going to be that however many

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:34.019
spotted lambs are born those are
the ones that I get.

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:37.048
And so it turned out that there
was a huge number of spotted

00:09:37.048 --> 00:09:39.586
lambs,
and so although Jacob had lent

00:09:39.586 --> 00:09:44.019
some of his sheep and his fields
to the person who wanted them he

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:47.759
got back vastly more than he
lent at the beginning.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:52.513
And so Antonio answers,
well, this isn't interest this

00:09:52.513 --> 00:09:53.590
is a risk.
 

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.759
Jacob got so much more because
he took a risk.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:58.889
Who would have known how many
lambs were going to be born.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:03.210
And so you don't really charge
interest, you're an investor.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.782
So they haggle over this for a
while and they come to the

00:10:06.782 --> 00:10:09.778
conclusion that he's going to
lend the money.

00:10:09.778 --> 00:10:12.279
And so what is the interest
that they actually end up

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:15.070
charging, the thing that Harold
Bloom couldn't remember?

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.440
Well, 0.
 

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.609
"I'll lend you the money
and take no doit of usance for

00:10:20.609 --> 00:10:22.971
my monies,"
not a single interest for my

00:10:22.971 --> 00:10:23.509
money.
 

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:26.274
But they have to negotiate
something else,

00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:29.038
something besides the rate of
interest.

00:10:29.038 --> 00:10:31.190
They have to negotiate the
collateral.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.320
And so they say,
"Go with me (blah,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.606
blah, blah, blah),
and then if you don't pay let

00:10:37.606 --> 00:10:41.873
the forfeit be an equal pound of
your fair flesh to be cut off

00:10:41.873 --> 00:10:45.928
and taken in what part of your
body pleaseth me."

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:48.996
The other half of the--there
were two lectures by Harold

00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:51.197
Bloom,
the second half of the first

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:55.019
lecture was what part of the
body is he really talking about,

00:10:55.019 --> 00:10:59.889
and there seemed to be only two
possibilities,

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:02.605
the heart and another
possibility, and Harold Bloom

00:11:02.605 --> 00:11:04.399
favored the second possibility.
 

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:07.477
But anyway, it's collateral
that they're putting up for the

00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:07.850
loan.
 

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.548
So there's collateral.
 

00:11:11.548 --> 00:11:14.900
So now what we found is that
Shakespeare has understood the

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.750
impatience theory of interest.
 

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:19.798
You've got an impatient
borrower and a patient lender,

00:11:19.798 --> 00:11:23.261
and it's the tradeoff between
patience and impatience which is

00:11:23.261 --> 00:11:25.928
going to decide what the rate of
interest is.

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:28.200
So that's already Irving
Fisher's biggest message.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.860
And then the second thing he's
noticed,

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:31.590
which Irving Fisher didn't
notice at all,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.710
and this is going to be a large
part of the rest of the course,

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.190
how do we know these people are
going to keep their promises.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.009
Why is Antonio going to keep
his promises?

00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:41.058
Well, it's because he's putting
up collateral.

00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:44.909
And Antonio is stepping in for
Bassanio because his collateral

00:11:44.909 --> 00:11:46.928
is worth more than Bassanio's.
 

00:11:46.928 --> 00:11:49.947
Shylock wants his pound of
flesh, not Bassanio's pound of

00:11:49.947 --> 00:11:50.379
flesh.
 

00:11:50.379 --> 00:11:53.011
So all right,
so that's the beginning by the

00:11:53.011 --> 00:11:53.379
way.
 

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:54.879
Just how does the play unfold?
 

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:55.769
It gets more interesting.
 

00:11:55.769 --> 00:11:59.904
So what happens is after
getting his money Bassanio then

00:11:59.904 --> 00:12:01.860
goes to woo fair Portia.
 

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.918
And how does he woo her?
 

00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:06.418
Well, it turns out the way that
her fabulously wealthy father

00:12:06.418 --> 00:12:09.394
has set up the marriage is,
there are three caskets,

00:12:09.394 --> 00:12:12.404
a gold one,
a silver one and a lead one,

00:12:12.404 --> 00:12:16.024
and he has to pick one,
and one of them contains her

00:12:16.024 --> 00:12:17.991
picture,
and if you get the one with her

00:12:17.991 --> 00:12:19.370
picture you get to marry her.
 

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.350
If you pick the wrong one,
and here's the shocking thing,

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.476
if you get the wrong one you
swear before you choose if you

00:12:25.476 --> 00:12:28.389
choose wrong never to speak to
lady afterward in way of

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:29.090
marriage.
 

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.158
So not only don't you get
Portia, you don't get anybody.

00:12:32.158 --> 00:12:37.769
So what is the purpose of this
absurd contract?

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:40.605
Well, the purpose is maybe to
make sure that people really

00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:41.600
want to marry her.
 

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.283
Maybe the father set it up so
that only someone who really

00:12:44.283 --> 00:12:46.966
wanted to marry her would bother
to enter this competition

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:50.431
because the risk is so high,
but another way of saying it is

00:12:50.431 --> 00:12:53.575
it gives an excuse to
Shakespeare to talk about risk

00:12:53.575 --> 00:12:57.273
and return and how people who
have a higher risk are going to

00:12:57.273 --> 00:12:59.000
expect a higher return.
 

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.129
So they talk about risk and
return.

00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:04.961
And Aragon basically says she's
really not that good looking to

00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:06.629
justify such a high risk.
 

00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:10.638
But anyway, all those other
guys picked the wrong casket and

00:13:10.638 --> 00:13:14.918
Bassanio picks the lead one and
gets her, and so she becomes the

00:13:14.918 --> 00:13:15.528
wife.
 

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:16.830
Now, of course,
she's delighted by this.

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.868
He's the one she wanted all
along, and so she says,

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:24.100
"Let me give you this
ring."

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.158
This is yet a third contract.
 

00:13:27.158 --> 00:13:29.399
The first contract is the loan
of Shylock.

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:33.024
The second contract is the
choosing the caskets and a

00:13:33.024 --> 00:13:37.070
contract that you won't marry
again if you choose wrong.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.150
And now we have a third
contract, which is Portia

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.940
deciding that she gives a ring
to Bassanio and she says,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.389
"Let this ring represent
your love."

00:13:45.389 --> 00:13:47.328
And he says,
"When this ring parts from

00:13:47.328 --> 00:13:49.450
this finger then parts life from
hence."

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.330
I'll never lose this ring.
 

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:51.519
I'll never give it up.
 

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:53.120
I love you so much.
 

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.960
So, of course,
the boats appear to sink.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.678
Calamity appears.
 

00:13:57.678 --> 00:14:00.693
"My ships have all
mis-credited [correction:

00:14:00.693 --> 00:14:01.950
miscarried]."
 

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.580
Shylock wants his collateral.
 

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.711
So Portia now,
who turns out to be incredibly

00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:11.269
wealthy--so we realize,
again, the play's not about

00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.908
love.
 

00:14:11.908 --> 00:14:14.639
She's beautiful,
but she's fabulously rich,

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:18.408
much richer than Shylock is,
much richer than Tubal was.

00:14:18.408 --> 00:14:21.070
They had to scrounge around to
get the 3,000 ducats.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.258
She hands 6,000 ducats,
and then 12,000 ducats,

00:14:25.258 --> 00:14:27.168
then 36,000 ducats.
 

00:14:27.168 --> 00:14:29.808
Says, look, offer Shylock all
this money.

00:14:29.808 --> 00:14:31.480
Tell him, here,
I've got the money.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.678
Tell him not to take his pound
of flesh.

00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:36.913
So they hold the trial to
decide whether Shylock should

00:14:36.913 --> 00:14:38.830
get his pound of flesh or not.
 

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.206
And so Shylock,
by this time,

00:14:41.206 --> 00:14:44.772
is incredibly pissed off,
to say the least,

00:14:44.772 --> 00:14:47.149
at Antonio and Bassanio.
 

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:48.558
And why is he so angry?
 

00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:52.216
Because among other things his
daughter Jessica has run off

00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:55.620
with a Christian named Lorenzo
and stolen his money.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.116
And so he yells,
"My daughter,

00:14:57.116 --> 00:14:57.908
my ducats."
 

00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:03.090
And so she sold his wife's ring
for a monkey,

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:09.330
or his ring that was given to
him by his wife Leah.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.302
And he says,
"I had it of Leah when I

00:15:11.302 --> 00:15:12.120
was a bachelor.
 

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.798
I would not have given it for a
wilderness of monkeys."

00:15:14.798 --> 00:15:17.720
So Shylock believes in keeping
his promise.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.928
He would never have broken a
promise.

00:15:19.928 --> 00:15:22.653
He never would have given away
the ring that was given to him

00:15:22.653 --> 00:15:23.289
by his wife.
 

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.649
He absolutely wouldn't do it.
 

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:29.408
He believes in keeping promises
unlike everybody else in the

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:33.038
play, his daughter,
everybody as we'll see.

00:15:33.038 --> 00:15:37.591
So Lancelot says,
"This making of Christians

00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:41.100
will raise the price of
hogs."

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.446
This Jewish girl Jessica has
become a Christian so now she's

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:47.678
going to be able to eat pork so
it's going to increase the

00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:50.970
demand for pork and therefore
raise the price of hogs.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.009
So Shakespeare--the play is
full of economics.

00:15:54.009 --> 00:15:55.649
It's all about teaching
economics.

00:15:55.649 --> 00:16:03.384
So anyway, they go to the trial
and Shylock thinks the guy is a

00:16:03.384 --> 00:16:05.379
complete fool.
 

00:16:05.379 --> 00:16:06.960
He doesn't understand interest.
 

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.404
He doesn't understand the whole
point of a lending contract and

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:13.072
getting interest,
and basically he says--I've got

00:16:13.072 --> 00:16:15.240
to skip over this a little
quickly.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.960
He says, we've got a contract.
 

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.681
Your city, the greatest
commercial city in the world at

00:16:22.681 --> 00:16:26.264
that time, can't possibly
survive if you don't uphold

00:16:26.264 --> 00:16:27.230
contracts.
 

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.259
So, "If you deny me,
fie upon your law.

00:16:30.259 --> 00:16:32.179
There's no force in the decrees
of Venice.

00:16:32.179 --> 00:16:33.389
I stand for judgment."
 

00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:36.769
I stand for keeping promises
and the law is supposed to

00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:37.960
enforce promises.
 

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:40.350
I stand for law is what Shylock
says.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.080
Now, at the trial,
who turns out to be the judge?

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.458
Well Portia has disguised
herself as the judge and she's

00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:47.750
actually the judge.
 

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:50.047
And so she comes in and she has
this famous line,

00:16:50.047 --> 00:16:52.918
"Who is the Merchant here
and which is the Jew?"

00:16:52.918 --> 00:16:54.928
So, again, this confirms to me
it's about economics.

00:16:54.928 --> 00:16:57.878
If it was about Judaism it
would be, who's the Christian

00:16:57.878 --> 00:16:58.950
and who's the Jew?
 

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:00.496
She's saying,
who's the borrower,

00:17:00.496 --> 00:17:01.610
and who's the lender.
 

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.788
That's how she comes in.
 

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:04.703
And so then she says,
"You've got to show

00:17:04.703 --> 00:17:05.298
mercy."
 

00:17:05.298 --> 00:17:06.813
And this is the most famous
line in the play,

00:17:06.813 --> 00:17:08.119
"The quality of
mercy," blah,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.430
blah.
 

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.009
You all remember it who've seen
it.

00:17:10.009 --> 00:17:13.247
And he says,
and then Bassanio says look,

00:17:13.247 --> 00:17:15.190
I've got 6,000 ducats.
 

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.730
I've got more than that,
take that.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.650
And he says a contract is a
contract.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:22.200
You've humiliated me,
all kinds of humiliations have

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.049
happened to me.
 

00:17:23.049 --> 00:17:23.970
I've got feelings too.
 

00:17:23.970 --> 00:17:24.920
I've been humiliated.
 

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.965
I want the contract and the
contract says that I should get

00:17:27.965 --> 00:17:29.068
the pound of flesh.
 

00:17:29.068 --> 00:17:32.951
And so Bassanio says,
"To do a great right do a

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.549
little wrong."
 

00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:37.289
So let him default.
 

00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:41.119
So what does Portia say?
 

00:17:41.119 --> 00:17:42.019
What is the judgment?
 

00:17:42.019 --> 00:17:44.200
She has to play the judge.
 

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.454
It seems like the whole city
depends on enforcing contracts

00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:50.150
and here it seems like a
horrible thing to do.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.868
You're going to have to kill
somebody.

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:55.170
So what judgment can she
possibly make?

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.414
She says, well,
the state has to enforce

00:17:57.414 --> 00:17:58.740
contracts, of course.
 

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.615
Contracts have to be enforced,
but only good contracts should

00:18:02.615 --> 00:18:03.519
be enforced.
 

00:18:03.519 --> 00:18:05.519
And so what's wrong with the
contract?

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:10.691
Does she say we're going to
reduce what you owe from 3,000

00:18:10.691 --> 00:18:11.690
to 1,500?
 

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:13.808
That's principal forgiveness.
 

00:18:13.808 --> 00:18:18.710
Does she say you don't have
to--what does she say?

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.505
What she says is that what was
wrong is, the contract wasn't

00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:23.019
right.
 

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.759
It wasn't the interest rate
that was wrong.

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:27.509
It wasn't the amount you owe
that was wrong.

00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:29.288
It was the collateral that was
wrong.

00:18:29.288 --> 00:18:32.930
So she says the right
collateral was a pound of flesh,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.711
but not a drop of blood,
and so the state intervenes not

00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:38.915
to change the interest rate,
not to change the principal,

00:18:38.915 --> 00:18:40.670
but to change the collateral.
 

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.604
So all right,
that's going to turn out to be,

00:18:44.604 --> 00:18:46.838
the leverage was wrong.
 

00:18:46.838 --> 00:18:50.096
So then the play ends with
Bassanio asking the judge,

00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:53.166
he's so pleased that things
have turned out right,

00:18:53.166 --> 00:18:55.108
if he can reward the judge.
 

00:18:55.108 --> 00:18:56.348
He doesn't know who the judge
is.

00:18:56.348 --> 00:18:58.631
And he says,
I've got all these ducats that

00:18:58.631 --> 00:19:01.075
I've just gotten,
why don't I give you some of

00:19:01.075 --> 00:19:01.890
the ducats?
 

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.066
And the judge says,
well no, I don't want the

00:19:04.066 --> 00:19:06.836
ducats, but I notice you've got
this ring on your finger,

00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:08.368
why don't you give me that?
 

00:19:08.368 --> 00:19:11.153
And he says,
well I can't do that,

00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:13.430
my Portia, I've promised.
 

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.430
And the judge says,
well, give it to me anyway and

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:19.390
he gives her the ring.
 

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.701
And so the play finally ends
with her revealing herself and

00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:26.068
he's incredibly embarrassed that
he's given her the ring.

00:19:26.068 --> 00:19:28.910
So this is another contract
broken, another default.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.507
And then he says,
but I'm never going to default

00:19:31.507 --> 00:19:31.950
again.
 

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.230
And Antonio steps in and says
I'll guarantee again that he'll

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.088
never default again,
and of course,

00:19:37.088 --> 00:19:39.440
we all know that he's going to
default.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:43.949
So the whole play is just about
contracts and breaking

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:44.970
contracts.
 

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.598
And so at first it's about what
the rate of interest should be,

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:50.439
then it switches to,
should contracts always be

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:52.317
enforced,
and yes they should be

00:19:52.317 --> 00:19:55.009
enforced, but the enforcement
should be the taking of

00:19:55.009 --> 00:19:58.009
collateral and sometimes the
amount of collateral put up is

00:19:58.009 --> 00:19:58.578
wrong.
 

00:19:58.578 --> 00:20:02.045
So that's going to be the
conclusion of this course that

00:20:02.045 --> 00:20:05.635
what went wrong in the last two
years or three years was a

00:20:05.635 --> 00:20:09.480
horrible mistake about how much
collateral to be put up,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.278
and the Fed instead of just
monitoring the interest rate,

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:14.464
which is what you're taught in
macroeconomics it's supposed to

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.705
do,
should be monitoring collateral

00:20:17.705 --> 00:20:21.710
as well and maybe even most
importantly.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:27.150
So with that introduction to
the rest of the course--

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.397
I don't know how convinced you
are about Shakespeare the

00:20:29.397 --> 00:20:33.685
economist,
but anyway, let's now switch to

00:20:33.685 --> 00:20:39.140
learning some of the basic words
of finance.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:47.660
So I'm going to now follow
pretty closely what the notes

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.588
are.
 

00:20:48.588 --> 00:20:51.989
All right, so let's imagine a
world where we've solved for the

00:20:51.989 --> 00:20:52.769
equilibrium.
 

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:55.563
This could be the real world or
one of our models,

00:20:55.563 --> 00:20:58.355
and there are many time
periods, not just two time

00:20:58.355 --> 00:20:59.038
periods.
 

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:02.180
So let's suppose that there,
as there are as we're going to

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:05.604
see in great detail later,
suppose it's possible to pay

00:21:05.604 --> 00:21:08.848
money today in order to get a
dollar next year,

00:21:08.848 --> 00:21:11.628
or pay some amount of money
today in order to get a dollar

00:21:11.628 --> 00:21:13.606
in two years,
or pay a different amount of

00:21:13.606 --> 00:21:15.490
money today to get a dollar in
three years.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:19.102
So pi_t is the amount
of money you pay today to get a

00:21:19.102 --> 00:21:20.210
dollar at time t.
 

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:24.230
That's called a zero because
there's no coupon.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:25.990
You just get something at the
end.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:29.576
And so we'll see next class
we're going to start talking

00:21:29.576 --> 00:21:33.750
about real markets and what the
prices of all those zeros are.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.553
So anyway, that pi_t
is something that is traded in

00:21:36.553 --> 00:21:39.261
the market and everybody at
every hedge fund and every Wall

00:21:39.261 --> 00:21:41.411
Street bank knows what
pi_t is at the

00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:42.720
beginning of each day.
 

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.153
Now, Fisher said,
well don't get too lost

00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:47.099
thinking about pi_t.
 

00:21:47.099 --> 00:21:48.589
Think about p_t.
 

00:21:48.589 --> 00:21:50.519
Take out inflation.
 

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:52.990
You have to make an expectation
about what inflation is,

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.420
but assuming you're right you
can figure out from these

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.308
pi_t's what
p_t is,

00:21:57.308 --> 00:22:01.097
the present value price:
how much would you pay today in

00:22:01.097 --> 00:22:03.440
goods to get an apple at time t?
 

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.672
Not a dollar at time t,
but an apple at time t,

00:22:05.672 --> 00:22:08.487
so it involves knowing what
inflation is and what the price

00:22:08.487 --> 00:22:10.380
of apples is going to be at time
t.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:12.570
So Fisher said,
there's a lot of stuff you can

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.518
do, but the
pi_ts--there's also

00:22:14.518 --> 00:22:17.440
more important stuff you can do
with the p_ts.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.130
You should always keep those in
mind.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:25.930
So let's take the simplest case
where pi_t is a

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:28.519
constant interest rate.
 

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:30.548
There's a constant interest
rate i.

00:22:30.548 --> 00:22:34.939
So if you ask what's a dollar
worth today in terms of how many

00:22:34.939 --> 00:22:37.890
dollars you can get next year
it's 1 i.

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.410
What's a dollar worth today in
two years is (1 i) squared.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:44.490
So putting it backwards,
a dollar in two years--the

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.509
price of it today must be 1 over
(1 i) squared.

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:49.388
So a dollar in t years,
the value today is 1 i over t

00:22:49.388 --> 00:22:50.980
[correction: 1 over (1 i) to the
power t].

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.358
So this is just a
simplification.

00:22:52.358 --> 00:22:56.972
So we'll see that lots of the
jargon of economics assumes that

00:22:56.972 --> 00:23:01.284
there's this constant interest
rate that's determining all

00:23:01.284 --> 00:23:02.568
these prices.
 

00:23:02.568 --> 00:23:08.888
So the first thing to realize
is what Fisher calls the present

00:23:08.888 --> 00:23:10.338
value price.
 

00:23:10.338 --> 00:23:14.210
If there were some asset that
paid off money in the future,

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.970
m_1 through
m_T,

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:19.194
you don't have to solve the
whole equilibrium to figure out

00:23:19.194 --> 00:23:22.808
what its price would be if you
knew the prices of these zeros,

00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:24.380
pi_1 through
pi_T.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:27.297
Because to get m_2
dollars at time 2 just cost you

00:23:27.297 --> 00:23:29.818
pi_2 times
m_2 dollars today.

00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:32.678
So you add up the cost of
buying all the cash flows or the

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:33.078
asset.
 

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.818
That has to be the price of the
asset today.

00:23:35.818 --> 00:23:39.818
And if the prices of the zeros
are given just by the interest

00:23:39.818 --> 00:23:44.019
rate discounting it then it's
just m_1 over (1 i),

00:23:44.019 --> 00:23:47.494
m_2 over (1 i)
squared, and m_T over

00:23:47.494 --> 00:23:48.568
(1 i) to the T.
 

00:23:48.568 --> 00:23:53.855
I see there's a typo here--oh
no, no there's no typo--it's (1

00:23:53.855 --> 00:23:55.088
i) to the T.
 

00:23:55.088 --> 00:23:57.848
They're all these (1 i) to the
T.

00:23:57.848 --> 00:24:03.061
So and now if the price weren't
that, if the price of this bond

00:24:03.061 --> 00:24:05.920
were, let's say,
smaller than this,

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.769
what would you do?
 

00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:10.768
You would buy the bond and at
the same time you'd sell

00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:12.634
promises to deliver
m_1,

00:24:12.634 --> 00:24:14.784
m_2,
and m_T in the

00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:15.519
future.
 

00:24:15.519 --> 00:24:18.321
If you sold those promises and
nobody doubted that you would

00:24:18.321 --> 00:24:20.988
keep your promise--
so this is something

00:24:20.988 --> 00:24:24.660
Shakespeare would have been
suspicious of--

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.162
but if you made those promises
and no one doubted you'd keep

00:24:28.162 --> 00:24:31.367
them you could raise this much
money by selling all the

00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:32.140
promises.
 

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.489
So you'd get this much money
and if the bond cost less than

00:24:35.489 --> 00:24:37.798
that you could make all the
promises,

00:24:37.798 --> 00:24:39.472
get all the money,
buy the bond,

00:24:39.472 --> 00:24:42.438
have money left over,
and then you'd have to keep all

00:24:42.438 --> 00:24:44.718
your promises,
but the bond itself would be

00:24:44.718 --> 00:24:47.758
paying you money in the future
that you could use to keep all

00:24:47.758 --> 00:24:48.618
your promises.
 

00:24:48.618 --> 00:24:51.960
So it has to be that this is
the price of the bond provided

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.529
that everybody will allow you to
borrow and lend at those rates

00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:57.922
of interest,
because if it weren't you would

00:24:57.922 --> 00:25:00.108
either buy the bond and sell all
the promises,

00:25:00.108 --> 00:25:03.099
or in the other case were the
prices higher you'd sell the

00:25:03.099 --> 00:25:07.279
bond,
get all this money and then use

00:25:07.279 --> 00:25:11.890
that money to buy all those
promises.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:15.657
Then you could make the
payments of the bond because the

00:25:15.657 --> 00:25:17.920
promises would come due to you.
 

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.431
So in that case you'd have to
believe people who made promises

00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:21.950
to you.
 

00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.188
So as long as nobody's doubting
the other people keeping their

00:25:25.188 --> 00:25:27.630
promises it has to be that by no
arbitrage,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.588
the price of a bond is just the
discounted cash flow.

00:25:30.588 --> 00:25:33.460
That was Fisher's main
principle.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:34.769
So we saw that last time.
 

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:36.828
We're just going to do it.
 

00:25:36.828 --> 00:25:40.410
So we're now going to introduce
a few vocabularies.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.828
So the first thing is the
doubling rule.

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:45.722
So I think at least half of you
probably know this,

00:25:45.722 --> 00:25:49.079
but it's much better if you can
do things in your head than

00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:50.990
having to calculate them all.
 

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.624
So the doubling rule says how
many years at i percent interest

00:25:54.624 --> 00:25:56.769
does it take to double your
money.

00:25:56.769 --> 00:26:01.328
So you can just solve this.
 

00:26:01.328 --> 00:26:06.083
So (1 i) to the n means that if
you take the logs of both sides

00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:08.920
and you know that log of 2 is
.69,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.480
then you take the log of both
sides,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:20.528
n log (1 i) has to be log of 2,
so n = .69 over log of (1 i).

00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:26.509
So now log of (1 i) is
approximately i.

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:27.250
Why is that?
 

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.338
So this is Taylor's rule.
 

00:26:28.338 --> 00:26:31.544
You don't actually have to know
this if you've never seen

00:26:31.544 --> 00:26:32.858
Taylor's rule before.
 

00:26:32.858 --> 00:26:37.250
But an approximation of log of
(1 i)--

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.942
for any function F of X,
it's F of A F prime of A times

00:26:40.942 --> 00:26:44.980
(X - A) 1 half F double prime of
A times (X - A) squared.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.740
That's the standard Taylor's
rule thing.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.358
So therefore log of (1 i) is,
you know log of 1 is 0,

00:26:51.358 --> 00:26:56.048
so it's going to be 0 i because
the derivative of the log is 1

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.970
over X and if X = 1 that's 1
over 1.

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.273
So it's 0 i,
and then the second derivative

00:27:02.273 --> 00:27:06.759
is minus 1 over X squared,
and if X = 1 that's minus 1.

00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:12.815
So with the half here log (1 i)
is approximately 0 i - i squared

00:27:12.815 --> 00:27:13.680
over 2.
 

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.690
So you can replace log of 1 i
with,

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:25.278
I mean .69 over log of 1 i with
.69 over i - i squared over 2,

00:27:25.278 --> 00:27:30.336
so for very small interest
rates i squared is practically

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:31.240
nothing.
 

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:41.978
So .69 over i if the interest
rate is .023 percent and .69

00:27:41.978 --> 00:27:46.500
divided by .023 is 30.
 

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.113
So it says that at 2.3 percent
interest you double your money

00:27:51.113 --> 00:27:52.190
in 30 years.
 

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:57.362
Well, if i is 7 percent,
say, then i squared is starting

00:27:57.362 --> 00:28:00.089
to get a little bit bigger.
 

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:03.598
So i - i squared over 2 is .07.
 

00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:08.480
i squared .0049 over 2 that's
.0675.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.670
So if I put in i = .07 it's .69
over .0675.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.048
That's around 69 over 67.
 

00:28:18.048 --> 00:28:21.038
There's a decimal thing,
so it's a little over 10,

00:28:21.038 --> 00:28:21.710
say 10.2.
 

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:27.890
That's like .72 over .07,
so .72 is the doubling rule.

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:30.961
To get for interest rates
around 7 percent,

00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:32.863
or 6 percent,
or 4 percent,

00:28:32.863 --> 00:28:36.594
something like that,
you're going to divide not into

00:28:36.594 --> 00:28:38.130
69 but into 72.
 

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.950
The interest rate is .07, right?
 

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.039
The interest rate is a percent,
so it's a decimal thing.

00:28:43.039 --> 00:28:47.358
So .06 is like 72 over 6.
 

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:51.210
So at 6 percent it takes 12
years to double your money.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:53.031
So the rule,
the basic rule is,

00:28:53.031 --> 00:28:56.737
if you want to know how long it
takes at 6 percent interest to

00:28:56.737 --> 00:29:00.260
double your money you just take
72 divided by 6 and it's 12

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:00.990
years.
 

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:04.598
If it's 8 percent interest 72
over 8 is about 9 years.

00:29:04.598 --> 00:29:08.807
If it's 10 percent interest
it's a little over 7 years to

00:29:08.807 --> 00:29:10.308
double your money.
 

00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:14.340
And so that rule is incredibly
useful to keep in your head

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.373
because you can shock and amaze
people by how fast you can

00:29:18.373 --> 00:29:21.910
compute things if you just
remember that rule.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:27.180
So let's just check the rule,
by the way.

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.402
So suppose that you have 24
dollars in the bank,

00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:36.180
and you have 6 percent
interest.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.460
So here I took the 24 dollars.
 

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.580
You look at the top you see
that's the B1 number,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:44.702
and I've just multiplied it by
the interest rate,

00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:46.980
1.06, and so I keep doing that.
 

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.288
Here I've multiplied the thing
above it by 1.06 again.

00:29:50.288 --> 00:29:53.142
So I keep investing the money
at 6 percent interest,

00:29:53.142 --> 00:29:56.608
and over here I've invested the
money at 7 percent interest.

00:29:56.608 --> 00:30:02.027
So anyway, after 12 years you
see that 24 dollars,

00:30:02.027 --> 00:30:06.781
this is year 1,
so at year 12,24 dollars has

00:30:06.781 --> 00:30:08.328
become 48.
 

00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:10.420
So it's a very good
approximation.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:14.250
And so 7 percent it's supposed
to take a little over 10 years.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.701
So at 10 years you're not quite
there, but 11 years you're past

00:30:17.701 --> 00:30:17.980
it.
 

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.080
So you can see how we're
starting with 24,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.410
you can see how good the
doubling rule is.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:27.598
So that's just something to
keep--so we can now do in class

00:30:27.598 --> 00:30:30.625
lots of concrete examples
without having to take out our

00:30:30.625 --> 00:30:33.923
calculators and stuff because we
can do them in class in your

00:30:33.923 --> 00:30:34.529
head.
 

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:45.630
All right, so let's just do
that now.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:49.269
Okay, so in fact why did I pick
24 dollars?

00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:52.130
Well, this is a famous story
you hear in second grade.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.977
The Indians sold Manhattan for
24 dollars in 1646,

00:30:56.977 --> 00:31:01.430
so how bad a deal was that for
the Indians?

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:05.061
It looks incredibly stupid,
but actually interest

00:31:05.061 --> 00:31:07.028
accumulates pretty fast.
 

00:31:07.028 --> 00:31:12.795
So if you look at 6 percent
interest, so 360 years gets you

00:31:12.795 --> 00:31:13.788
to 2006.
 

00:31:13.788 --> 00:31:16.970
That's a sort of round number
at 6 percent.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:19.180
So at 6 percent how long does
it take to double?

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.890
It takes 12 years to double.
 

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:23.981
So that means at 6 percent
interest you're doubling every

00:31:23.981 --> 00:31:24.588
12 years.
 

00:31:24.588 --> 00:31:29.180
So in 360 years you're going to
double 30 times.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:33.356
So in your head you can figure
out that doubling 30 times is 2

00:31:33.356 --> 00:31:36.644
to the thirtieth,
and of course 2 to the tenth is

00:31:36.644 --> 00:31:38.700
something you should know.
 

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.170
It's 1,024.
 

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.558
So I'm sure you know that
number, right,

00:31:43.558 --> 00:31:46.294
2 to the--anyway,
that's a good one to remember 2

00:31:46.294 --> 00:31:50.116
to the tenth is about 1,000,
so 1,000 cubed is about a

00:31:50.116 --> 00:31:53.818
billion, so basically 24 becomes
24 billion.

00:31:53.818 --> 00:31:57.270
So at 6 percent interest they
sold Manhattan for 24 billion in

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.288
today's dollars.
 

00:31:58.288 --> 00:32:02.213
So that's pitifully low,
but if you look at 7 percent

00:32:02.213 --> 00:32:05.460
interest you can do the same
calculation.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.960
So at 7 percent interest you
should do this in your head now.

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.950
So it's going to double every
72 over 7 years.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.801
So there are 360 years,
about, 360 is a very round

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:21.951
number, so 360 divided by 72
over 7 that's 5 times 7,

00:32:21.951 --> 00:32:23.140
it's 35.
 

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.729
So 2 to the thirty-fifth,
well it's like a billion times

00:32:27.729 --> 00:32:30.150
2 to the fifth which is 32.
 

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:35.625
So 1 dollar becomes 32 billion,
but we started with 24 dollars

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:37.598
so it's 768 billion.
 

00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:41.606
So now you're starting to get a
little bit closer to what the

00:32:41.606 --> 00:32:43.210
value of Manhattan is.
 

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:46.255
I mean, the value of all the
real estate in the country,

00:32:46.255 --> 00:32:49.298
all the houses in the country
used to be 20 trillion.

00:32:49.298 --> 00:32:50.930
I'm not sure how far they've
gone down now.

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.720
Let's say they're 15 trillion.
 

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.279
So 15 trillion you add
commercial real estate,

00:32:56.279 --> 00:33:00.315
maybe in the whole country
that's worth 25 trillion,

00:33:00.315 --> 00:33:04.430
but that went down too so let's
say 20 trillion.

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:07.053
Now how much of the 20 trillion
could possibly be in New York

00:33:07.053 --> 00:33:07.358
City?
 

00:33:07.358 --> 00:33:10.048
I've actually got no idea,
but it can't be that much

00:33:10.048 --> 00:33:12.210
more--the whole country is 20
trillion.

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.778
New York can't be worth more
than 1 or 2 trillion of the 20

00:33:15.778 --> 00:33:18.180
trillion, so you're not that far
off.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.413
So the deal's not that
spectacularly bad although it

00:33:20.413 --> 00:33:21.288
sounds ridiculous.
 

00:33:21.288 --> 00:33:23.348
Anyway, the point is you can do
this in your head.

00:33:23.348 --> 00:33:28.830
So now the next thing that you
realize in this example is how

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:32.119
huge a difference a percent
makes.

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:34.920
So why is that so important?
 

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.974
Well, managers,
hedge funds,

00:33:36.974 --> 00:33:39.640
we all charge a percent
interest.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.220
So look at what's happening.
 

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.047
I mean, if you look at our
Indian investment of 24 and you

00:33:46.047 --> 00:33:49.740
look--I don't know how many
years you want to look over,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.088
but you can look over 36 years.
 

00:33:52.088 --> 00:33:54.085
That's a sort of
typical--you're young and making

00:33:54.085 --> 00:33:54.750
an investment.
 

00:33:54.750 --> 00:34:02.509
When you get old what's the
difference?

00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:06.325
This was the 6 percent growth
and this was the 7 percent

00:34:06.325 --> 00:34:06.950
growth.
 

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.889
This is the difference and this
is the, I guess,

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:11.639
the percentage difference.
 

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:15.500
So it's 28 percent.
 

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:23.032
Of course I didn't label these,
but yeah so this is the

00:34:23.032 --> 00:34:29.730
difference and this is the
percent difference.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.510
So the percent difference I
just showed it to you.

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:38.559
Over 36 years it's a 28.6
percent difference.

00:34:38.559 --> 00:34:41.389
So a typical--you're putting
money away right now.

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:42.900
You might be giving it to some
fund.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:46.079
You might be investing
it--whatever fund you're

00:34:46.079 --> 00:34:48.637
investing in,
they could be charging 1

00:34:48.637 --> 00:34:50.090
percent interest.
 

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:51.862
And it seems,
what's 1 percent,

00:34:51.862 --> 00:34:54.639
it's a tiny amount,
1 percent, but over 30 years

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.829
they're taking 28 percent of
your money, 36 years.

00:34:57.829 --> 00:35:00.896
With the Indians over 360 years
we saw that it was an

00:35:00.896 --> 00:35:03.079
astronomical amount that they
took.

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:05.260
They took almost all your
money, right?

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:15.000
So look at the percentage that
got taken, so 768 billion versus

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.969
24 billion, I mean,
it's astounding.

00:35:20.969 --> 00:35:23.967
So giving 1 percent away to a
money manager is giving away a

00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:26.813
fortune if you think you're
going to stick with the money

00:35:26.813 --> 00:35:29.050
manager for a reasonable amount
of time.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:31.311
So if you want the secret to
how hedge funds make money

00:35:31.311 --> 00:35:33.949
that's the first way they make
it and the most important way.

00:35:33.949 --> 00:35:37.083
They charge a fee that sounds
small, but it adds up over a few

00:35:37.083 --> 00:35:39.599
years and it amounts to a huge
amount of money.

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:41.849
Now, you can make it much
smaller.

00:35:41.849 --> 00:35:43.510
Why does it amount to so much
money?

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.103
Because the money that you put
in the fund you're keeping in

00:35:46.103 --> 00:35:48.389
the fund, so it's growing and
growing and growing.

00:35:48.389 --> 00:35:51.320
So they're taking 1 percent of
your 24 dollars today.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:53.873
That sounds like nothing,
but the money is still there

00:35:53.873 --> 00:35:56.572
and now 40 years later they're
taking 1 percent of a much

00:35:56.572 --> 00:35:57.440
bigger number.
 

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:01.119
That's why that number gets to
be so large.

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:04.110
So that's the second thing.
 

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:05.710
So now, let's keep going.
 

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.650
So that's the basic thing.
 

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:10.594
So now let's go to define a few
terms that everybody should

00:36:10.594 --> 00:36:10.949
know.
 

00:36:10.949 --> 00:36:12.940
What's a coupon bond?
 

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.027
A coupon bond is the simplest
kind of bond,

00:36:16.027 --> 00:36:20.289
the first one that was created,
and it pays a fixed coupon,

00:36:20.289 --> 00:36:23.230
dollars, every period for T
periods.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:24.760
The T's called the maturity.
 

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.923
So it's defined by the coupon
which is the fixed payment it

00:36:27.923 --> 00:36:31.143
makes every year until period T
which is the maturity of the

00:36:31.143 --> 00:36:32.880
bond,
and then it also,

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.248
at the end of period T,
pays a principal which is

00:36:37.248 --> 00:36:41.230
usually how the bond is
denominated--

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.572
the face value of the bond--it
pays the principal or face

00:36:44.572 --> 00:36:45.050
value.
 

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:47.639
That's usually 100 or 1,000.
 

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:53.489
So a coupon might be 6,6,
6,6, 106.

00:36:53.489 --> 00:36:56.369
That would be a 6 percent
coupon bond.

00:36:56.369 --> 00:37:00.005
You can also define the coupon
by the percentage of the face

00:37:00.005 --> 00:37:02.409
that it pays every year as a
coupon,

00:37:02.409 --> 00:37:07.610
so little c is the percentage,
so .06 times 100 is 6,

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:08.739
6,6, 6,6, 6.
 

00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:11.840
I could use big C as 6 dollars.
 

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.882
So it's defined by its
percentage, by the face and by

00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:17.050
the maturity.
 

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:22.003
So the first obvious thing to
say is if the interest rate is 6

00:37:22.003 --> 00:37:27.121
percent and the bond is paying a
6 percent coupon then it has to

00:37:27.121 --> 00:37:30.364
be worth its face--
so let's always assume the face

00:37:30.364 --> 00:37:30.719
is 100.
 

00:37:30.719 --> 00:37:35.159
So why is that?
 

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:39.295
It doesn't seem totally obvious
because the formula is you take

00:37:39.295 --> 00:37:43.099
100 times c (that's the first
payment) divided by 1 i,

00:37:43.099 --> 00:37:47.050
then 100 times c divided by (1
i) squared etcetera.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.722
It's not so obvious that's
going to turn out to be equal to

00:37:49.722 --> 00:37:50.000
100.
 

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.789
But so you just have to think
for a second why that should be.

00:37:52.789 --> 00:37:56.375
And the way to think of this is
if you had 100 dollars in the

00:37:56.375 --> 00:38:00.139
bank at 6 percent interest you
get 106 dollars the next year.

00:38:00.139 --> 00:38:03.456
Take the 6 and spend it,
you'd still have 100 dollars in

00:38:03.456 --> 00:38:04.119
the bank.
 

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:06.130
That would give you 6 dollars
again the next year.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.586
You could take that 6 dollars
and spend it,

00:38:07.586 --> 00:38:09.079
you'd still have 100 dollars in
the bank.

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:12.585
You keep doing that until the
last year when you've got 106

00:38:12.585 --> 00:38:13.190
dollars.
 

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:16.384
So at 6 percent interest
putting the money in the bank

00:38:16.384 --> 00:38:20.000
and spending the coupons would
give you exactly the same cash

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.050
flow as the bond's giving you.
 

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:25.097
So therefore whether you put
the money at the bank at 6

00:38:25.097 --> 00:38:28.485
percent interest or buy the bond
you're getting the same cash

00:38:28.485 --> 00:38:30.550
flow,
so it has to be by no arbitrage

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:32.440
that the initial outlay was the
same,

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.820
so it has to be 100 dollars.
 

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:38.250
Well, that's obvious.
 

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.360
Now you can prove it many
different ways.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.454
Now you can also imagine
keeping a bond forever paying 6

00:38:44.454 --> 00:38:45.869
percent interest.
 

00:38:45.869 --> 00:38:49.423
Then you get--a 100 dollars at
6 percent interest would give

00:38:49.423 --> 00:38:50.869
you 6 dollars forever.
 

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:54.056
So if there was 6 percent
interest and you were getting 12

00:38:54.056 --> 00:38:57.467
dollars forever,
how much would that be worth at

00:38:57.467 --> 00:39:00.793
6 percent interest,
12 dollars forever,

00:39:00.793 --> 00:39:04.085
6 percent interest,
you get 12 dollars every year

00:39:04.085 --> 00:39:06.679
forever,
what's that?

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:10.579
How many dollars is that worth
originally?

00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:12.929
If the interest rate that all
banks are giving,

00:39:12.929 --> 00:39:15.527
and the whole world's agreeing
6 percent is the rate of

00:39:15.527 --> 00:39:18.414
interest and someone is offering
to give you 12 dollars every

00:39:18.414 --> 00:39:21.489
year forever,
how much money in present value

00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:23.199
terms is he giving you?
 

00:39:23.199 --> 00:39:24.539
Student: 200.
 

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:25.679
Prof: 200, right?
 

00:39:25.679 --> 00:39:30.134
Because 200 at 6 percent would
give you 12 dollars every year,

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:34.150
so these are the most basic
formulas to keep in mind.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:38.416
So those you may be hearing
these things for the first time

00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:41.360
so it takes a second to adjust
to it,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.530
but there's no cleverness
involved in figuring these out.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:50.838
Now, so we've got the doubling
rule, we've got coupon bonds,

00:39:50.838 --> 00:39:52.869
so that's simple.
 

00:39:52.869 --> 00:39:55.619
Now, somewhat subtler thing is
an annuity.

00:39:55.619 --> 00:40:02.034
So an annuity pays you a fixed
amount for a fixed number of

00:40:02.034 --> 00:40:02.920
years.
 

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:06.260
So it doesn't pay the principal
at the end, so it pays that C.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.340
That's supposed to be a capital
C.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:11.621
It pays C, C,
C, C for a fixed number of

00:40:11.621 --> 00:40:12.500
years.
 

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.789
So it's a T period annuity.
 

00:40:14.789 --> 00:40:19.329
Now annuities also can be
changed in two important ways.

00:40:19.329 --> 00:40:22.480
They can be indexed to
inflation.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.849
That's a much better annuity
because now you're protected

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:28.409
against inflation.
 

00:40:28.409 --> 00:40:31.530
It also could be timed to last
the rest of your life.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.721
So we're going to come to this
when we talk about Social

00:40:33.721 --> 00:40:34.159
Security.
 

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:37.697
The most important annuity by
far in the whole economy is the

00:40:37.697 --> 00:40:39.230
Social Security annuity.
 

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.652
Once you retire and you're in
Social Security they figure out

00:40:43.652 --> 00:40:46.969
what your coupon is going to be
every year.

00:40:46.969 --> 00:40:49.730
I'll tell you the formula in a
couple of classes.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:52.581
So depending on how much you've
contributed they calculate what

00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:53.869
your coupon is every year.
 

00:40:53.869 --> 00:40:58.289
So from the day you turn 65 for
the rest of your life you get

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.719
the same C inflation corrected.
 

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:03.077
So we're going to have to talk
about why they decided on that

00:41:03.077 --> 00:41:03.510
contract.
 

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.929
But anyway, that's an annuity.
 

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:07.849
So it depends on the length of
life.

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:11.550
So these annuities are famous
in history.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.713
Jane Austen in Sense and
Sensibility said it was a

00:41:14.713 --> 00:41:17.822
disaster because whenever you
give someone an annuity they

00:41:17.822 --> 00:41:18.750
live forever.
 

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.791
And she said that,
some character says her mother

00:41:22.791 --> 00:41:27.927
gave the servants in the houses
annuities after their husbands

00:41:27.927 --> 00:41:31.969
died and she figured that they
were so old--

00:41:31.969 --> 00:41:32.940
she gave the annuities.
 

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.853
They were the servants of her
mother's and she gave them the

00:41:35.853 --> 00:41:37.679
annuity after their husbands
died,

00:41:37.679 --> 00:41:40.273
and since they were so old she
figured she'd pay them a few

00:41:40.273 --> 00:41:41.929
years and that'd be the end of
it,

00:41:41.929 --> 00:41:43.510
and they just went on and on
and on,

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.630
and she got tired of giving
them all the money.

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.690
But anyway, so obviously when
you're giving a life annuity you

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.550
have to calculate how long the
person's going to live,

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.309
and so we're going to come back
to that,

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:56.590
the selection of who takes
annuities.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:58.349
Do they know that they're going
to live longer or not?

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:00.550
Anyway, that market's all
screwed up and we're going to

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.342
come to that later,
but it's a famous market,

00:42:02.342 --> 00:42:03.280
the annuity market.
 

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.909
Now, how can you figure out the
value of an annuity?

00:42:07.909 --> 00:42:14.670
So this is a very simple thing
to do once you've come this far.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.539
So this is the next thing to
remember.

00:42:16.539 --> 00:42:20.469
So remember,
an annuity's paying C,

00:42:20.469 --> 00:42:23.360
C, C, C up to period T.
 

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.989
Here are the periods T.
 

00:42:25.989 --> 00:42:30.240
So how much should this be
worth, the present value,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:33.909
what is the present value today
at time 0?

00:42:33.909 --> 00:42:38.931
Well, we know that if it
actually went forever,

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:44.829
C, C like that it would
be--forever, it would go C over

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:47.449
the interest rate i.
 

00:42:47.449 --> 00:42:50.527
Annuities are often inflation
corrected so I wrote r for the

00:42:50.527 --> 00:42:51.780
real rate of interest.
 

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:53.835
So you could call it C over r
for the real rate of interest,

00:42:53.835 --> 00:42:54.219
whatever.
 

00:42:54.219 --> 00:42:55.619
Let's say it's nominal.
 

00:42:55.619 --> 00:42:59.244
Let's keep to i even though I
haven't used that notation

00:42:59.244 --> 00:43:00.630
there, so C over i.
 

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:05.768
If you get C dollars forever
it's called a perpetuity.

00:43:05.768 --> 00:43:09.010
So a perpetuity we already know
how to value.

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.889
We said C over i, right?
 

00:43:10.889 --> 00:43:13.434
At 6 percent if you're getting
12 dollars every year,

00:43:13.434 --> 00:43:14.659
it's worth 200 dollars.
 

00:43:14.659 --> 00:43:16.929
Now, what if it gets cutoff at
T?

00:43:16.929 --> 00:43:20.346
It sounds like there's going to
be a very complicated formula to

00:43:20.346 --> 00:43:23.219
calculate, but actually it's a
very simple formula.

00:43:23.219 --> 00:43:24.469
Why is that?
 

00:43:24.469 --> 00:43:34.679
Because the T period--so here's
the perpetuity and the T period

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:44.393
annuity equals the perpetuity
minus a perpetuity starting at

00:43:44.393 --> 00:43:56.092
time T--
minus perpetuity contracted at

00:43:56.092 --> 00:44:00.460
time T--
right?

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.460
So why is that?
 

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.809
Here we have a perpetuity.
 

00:44:03.809 --> 00:44:07.989
At time 0 you say to someone,
the state, the government says,

00:44:07.989 --> 00:44:11.820
we'll pay you and your
descendants C dollars forever.

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:14.630
So we know what that's worth,
C over i.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:18.447
Now we say suppose the state
tells you we're going to pay you

00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:19.530
C until time T?
 

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:20.510
What's that worth?
 

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.309
Well, it's worth this,
the whole thing,

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:27.148
minus this part of it,
but looked at from this point

00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:31.889
of view here the whole part of
it is just a perpetuity again.

00:44:31.889 --> 00:44:39.630
So it's just the perpetuity
which is C over i - C over i,

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.353
another perpetuity here,
but as of time T because that's

00:44:43.353 --> 00:44:45.338
like the 0 time--
the money's coming,

00:44:45.338 --> 00:44:46.820
the next period,
forever.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.269
Just like at time 0 the money
came starting at period 1

00:44:49.269 --> 00:44:52.175
forever,
so at time T starting 1 period

00:44:52.175 --> 00:44:57.505
later forever,
so therefore it's this divided

00:44:57.505 --> 00:45:00.070
by (1 i) to the T.
 

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:07.280
So it's just C over i times (1
- (1 over (1 i) to the T)).

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.599
So this is the next thing you
have to memorize,

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:11.869
unfortunately,
but there are only a few things

00:45:11.869 --> 00:45:13.130
you have to memorize.
 

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.949
So this is a very famous
formula for the value of an

00:45:16.949 --> 00:45:17.699
annuity.
 

00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:24.070
So let's just do an example.
 

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:27.719
Suppose somebody--maybe I can
just do the same examples,

00:45:27.719 --> 00:45:30.440
so you've got the proof of
that, right?

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:36.969
This is no surprise?
 

00:45:36.969 --> 00:45:39.440
Remember the whole perpetuity
is obviously,

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440
it's 6 percent.
 

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.409
Let's just think of something
at 6 percent.

00:45:43.409 --> 00:45:45.739
So let's do the 6 percent
annuity.

00:45:45.739 --> 00:46:10.940
At 6 percent interest a 12
dollar perpetuity is worth 200

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:15.440
dollars.
 

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.980
That's what we said before.
 

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:24.639
So what is a 36 year?
 

00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:29.009
So at 6 percent interest a 12
dollar perpetuity is worth 200

00:46:29.009 --> 00:46:29.750
dollars.
 

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:40.317
So at 6 percent interest what
is a 12 dollar 30 year annuity

00:46:40.317 --> 00:46:41.750
worth?
 

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:47.920
It's worth what?
 

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.599
How much is that worth?
 

00:46:52.599 --> 00:46:56.409
So if it went on forever it
would be worth $200 dollars.

00:46:56.409 --> 00:47:07.206
If we cut it off after 30
years--30 years is a bad time to

00:47:07.206 --> 00:47:09.670
cut it off.
 

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:21.530
Let's cut if off after 24 years.
 

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.889
So you have 6 percent interest.
 

00:47:23.889 --> 00:47:26.681
You get 12 dollars,
not for every year in the

00:47:26.681 --> 00:47:29.789
future, but for 24 years,
how much is it worth?

00:47:29.789 --> 00:47:32.199
Well, it can't be worth 200
dollars because it would be

00:47:32.199 --> 00:47:33.940
worth 200 dollars if it went
forever.

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:37.510
So it's worth less than 200
dollars, but how much less?

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.489
So my uncle died,
left my sister an annuity.

00:47:40.489 --> 00:47:45.699
She just had no idea what the
annuity was worth.

00:47:45.699 --> 00:47:49.840
So do you have any idea what
it's worth?

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.030
Yep?
 

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.530
Student: 150 bucks.
 

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:55.030
Prof: It is,
and how did you get that?

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:58.704
Student: The doubling
rule at 6 percent interest it

00:47:58.704 --> 00:48:02.317
takes 12 years to double your
money so in 24 years you're

00:48:02.317 --> 00:48:04.510
going to quadruple your money.
 

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:07.360
So then you just put that 4
into the equation.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:11.925
Prof: So it's 1 - 1
quarter, so that's 3 quarters,

00:48:11.925 --> 00:48:15.920
and 3 quarters times the 200 we
got before is 150,

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:16.900
exactly.
 

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:18.019
Exactly right what he said.
 

00:48:18.019 --> 00:48:22.489
So does everybody get that?
 

00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:24.429
Let's try another one.
 

00:48:24.429 --> 00:48:40.429
So let's suppose I pay 8
dollars.

00:48:40.429 --> 00:48:49.199
Let's see, how long is this
going to be?

00:48:49.199 --> 00:48:52.742
Let me say that again just in
case you didn't follow that

00:48:52.742 --> 00:48:56.539
because I'm going to give a
slightly harder one this time.

00:48:56.539 --> 00:48:58.670
So he's saying how do you
figure out the value of an

00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:59.090
annuity?
 

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.260
Something by next class you'll
be able to do in your head.

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.947
It's going to be,
take the cash flow that you get

00:49:04.947 --> 00:49:05.619
over here.
 

00:49:05.619 --> 00:49:08.204
If it went forever it'd be so
easy to figure out what the

00:49:08.204 --> 00:49:08.760
value was.
 

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:11.757
If it's 12 dollars at 6 percent
interest that's like having 200

00:49:11.757 --> 00:49:14.657
dollars in the bank because then
at 6 percent interest you're

00:49:14.657 --> 00:49:16.929
going to get 12 dollars every
year forever.

00:49:16.929 --> 00:49:20.576
So we know that 12 dollars a
year forever is clearly 200

00:49:20.576 --> 00:49:21.239
dollars.
 

00:49:21.239 --> 00:49:24.869
That's C over i,
12 over .06 is 200 dollars,

00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:28.500
but it's going to get cut off
in year 24.

00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.869
So we're going to lose all this
future stuff,

00:49:30.869 --> 00:49:32.969
but the future's not worth very
much.

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:34.670
Why isn't it worth very much?
 

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:37.824
Because by the time we get here
we've already discounted by a

00:49:37.824 --> 00:49:38.139
lot.
 

00:49:38.139 --> 00:49:41.592
So a dollar starting here is
actually only 1 quarter of a

00:49:41.592 --> 00:49:44.597
dollar starting back here,
because in 24 years at 6

00:49:44.597 --> 00:49:46.630
percent interest you've doubled
twice,

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.018
so it's worth 1 quarter.
 

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:50.679
So you just take 1 quarter of
the same annuity.

00:49:50.679 --> 00:49:56.650
So it's 1 - 1 quarter of the
same annuity.

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.112
So the one that ends in 24
years is like 3 quarters of the

00:50:00.112 --> 00:50:03.090
value of the perpetuity,
3 quarters of 200 is 150,

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:04.610
that's how we did it.
 

00:50:04.610 --> 00:50:07.829
So let's reverse the thing.
 

00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:13.929
Suppose we know the present
value's 100.

00:50:13.929 --> 00:50:16.802
You're now the company,
and you're trying to figure out

00:50:16.802 --> 00:50:17.760
how much to pay.
 

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:20.150
So what is the C going to be?
 

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:25.925
Let's say it's 8 percent
interest, and I'll just do the

00:50:25.925 --> 00:50:28.920
same example in the notes.
 

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:35.288
In 30 years a typical thing,
so it's not going to work out

00:50:35.288 --> 00:50:40.092
exactly evenly,
so 8 percent interest for 30

00:50:40.092 --> 00:50:41.210
years.
 

00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:47.110
So we know it's worth 100.
 

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:50.050
So let's get rid of all the
irrelevant stuff so you don't

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:51.469
have the board cluttered.
 

00:50:51.469 --> 00:50:56.730
We've got something that's
worth 100.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.440
There's the formula down here.
 

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.679
So the thing is worth 100.
 

00:51:02.679 --> 00:51:06.967
You know the interest rate is 8
percent now, and it's a 30 year

00:51:06.967 --> 00:51:07.659
annuity.
 

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:09.947
So if somebody tells you the
interest rate's 8 percent these

00:51:09.947 --> 00:51:11.614
days, you're going to get a 30
year annuity,

00:51:11.614 --> 00:51:13.050
you've got 100 dollars to
invest.

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:15.380
You go to the annuities
company, the insurance company,

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.690
you tell them,
"I want an annuity,"

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:19.739
how much do they give you every
year?

00:51:19.739 --> 00:51:21.929
Well, you just have to figure
out what C is.

00:51:21.929 --> 00:51:29.440
So you put C over .08,
so what does that tell you?

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:33.840
What would that be?
 

00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:45.179
What would they be paying you
if it was a perpetuity?

00:51:45.179 --> 00:51:47.750
If it was a perpetuity what
would they be paying you?

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:49.650
They'd be paying 8 dollars a
year, right?

00:51:49.650 --> 00:51:52.775
So but they're only going to
pay you for 30 years,

00:51:52.775 --> 00:51:56.349
so how much are they going to
pay you, (1 I) to the T.

00:51:56.349 --> 00:52:03.117
So this is 1.08 to the
thirtieth, and what's 1.08 to

00:52:03.117 --> 00:52:05.239
the thirtieth?
 

00:52:05.239 --> 00:52:08.768
Well, 1.08 to the thirtieth by
our rule is what?

00:52:08.768 --> 00:52:12.690
It's equal to 1.08 to the
twenty-seventh--

00:52:12.690 --> 00:52:15.469
in 9 years at 8 percent
interest it'll double,

00:52:15.469 --> 00:52:19.980
so after 27 years it's going to
double 3 times,

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:24.550
1.08 to the third power.
 

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:28.070
So after 27 years it's going to
double 3 times,

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:32.380
so that's eight,
right, 2 to the third power is

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.815
8 and then at 8 percent over 3
years it's 108 goes to about

00:52:37.815 --> 00:52:40.021
116,
goes to about 124,

00:52:40.021 --> 00:52:44.487
but you know it's going to grow
a little faster because 1.08

00:52:44.487 --> 00:52:49.179
times 1.08 is a little bit more
than 1.16 so it's going to grow

00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:55.130
to like 1.25 instead of 1.24,
so that's 10.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:58.039
So this is just 1 over 10.
 

00:52:58.039 --> 00:53:00.039
So the whole thing is 9 tenths.
 

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:03.940
So basically you get almost all
the value.

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.949
After 30 years at 8 percent
interest it's such a high

00:53:06.949 --> 00:53:10.364
interest rate that after 30
years you're getting 9 tenths of

00:53:10.364 --> 00:53:13.489
the value of the annuity
[correction: perpetuity].

00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:17.768
So you're going to have to get
paid 10 ninths,

00:53:17.768 --> 00:53:19.670
the 8,000 dollars.
 

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.364
It would have been 8,000
dollars if it were a

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:23.518
perpetuity--you have to pay the
guy a little bit more.

00:53:23.518 --> 00:53:25.903
You have to get a little bit
more because you're only getting

00:53:25.903 --> 00:53:26.619
it for 30 years.
 

00:53:26.619 --> 00:53:29.681
But because the interest rate's
so high the stuff after 30 years

00:53:29.681 --> 00:53:30.800
isn't very important.
 

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.139
You have to be given an extra
tenth.

00:53:34.139 --> 00:53:39.327
So it's 10 ninths times 8,000
so it's 8,888 is what your

00:53:39.327 --> 00:53:42.630
annuity's going to be every
year.

00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:46.889
So just to summarize it,
to say it all again,

00:53:46.889 --> 00:53:49.949
we know how to compute
perpetuities with ease,

00:53:49.949 --> 00:53:51.885
and so if you want 100
[thousand]

00:53:51.885 --> 00:53:54.851
dollars and a coupon forever,
and the interest rate's 8

00:53:54.851 --> 00:53:56.130
percent this is 8,000 forever.
 

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.097
If you only get it for a
shorter amount of time,

00:53:58.097 --> 00:53:59.480
obviously you have to get more.
 

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.730
How much more?
 

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:01.820
Well, it depends.
 

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.326
Each year for only 30 years it
depends on how much you're

00:54:04.326 --> 00:54:05.400
giving up at that end.
 

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:09.846
And at 8 percent you're only
giving up a tenth of the whole

00:54:09.846 --> 00:54:10.460
value.
 

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:16.478
So you have to be compensated
for that each year by getting 10

00:54:16.478 --> 00:54:20.722
ninths of what you would have
gotten before,

00:54:20.722 --> 00:54:23.190
so we're up to 8,888.
 

00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:27.610
So those are the words that
everybody has to know.

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:32.061
So now let's just do a couple
more simple computations here

00:54:32.061 --> 00:54:36.130
just to give you an idea of how
Fisher helped here.

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.480
So I'm going to do a few
mortgage things.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.719
I haven't defined mortgage yet.
 

00:54:40.719 --> 00:54:44.960
Why didn't I do that?
 

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:51.510
So a mortgage is just a 30 year
annuity.

00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:53.610
So one more thing--a mortgage
is an annuity.

00:54:53.610 --> 00:55:08.873
A fixed mortgage,
a fixed rate mortgage is

00:55:08.873 --> 00:55:18.179
defined by a principal.
 

00:55:18.179 --> 00:55:21.547
So when we talk about the
crisis this word principal will

00:55:21.547 --> 00:55:22.929
come up all the time.
 

00:55:22.929 --> 00:55:33.445
So that's the face value,
a principal,

00:55:33.445 --> 00:55:45.099
a mortgage coupon rate,
and a maturity.

00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:45.980
This is a fixed rate mortgage.
 

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:50.110
So the most common kind of
maturity is 30 years,

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:54.445
30 years is the most common and
then sometimes there are 15 year

00:55:54.445 --> 00:55:56.375
mortgages,
and then there's a whole host

00:55:56.375 --> 00:55:58.516
of other mortgages we're going
to come to later where there's

00:55:58.516 --> 00:55:59.480
floating interest rates.
 

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.130
So the 30 year mortgage,
how much do you have to pay?

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:07.949
Well, if it were on an annual
payment and it were an 8 percent

00:56:07.949 --> 00:56:12.340
mortgage for 30 years on a
100,000 dollars,

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:19.405
so if it was a 100,000 dollar
principle at 8 percent coupon

00:56:19.405 --> 00:56:26.960
for 30 years we just calculated
that you would have to pay,

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:32.369
the payment would be 8,888
dollars a year,

00:56:32.369 --> 00:56:38.420
because 8,888 dollars a year
discounted at 8 percent is going

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.639
to give you 100,000.
 

00:56:40.639 --> 00:56:42.059
So that's how the mortgage
works.

00:56:42.059 --> 00:56:45.326
So whenever you hear about a
mortgage you always hear the

00:56:45.326 --> 00:56:47.659
mortgage rate,
that's the coupon rate.

00:56:47.659 --> 00:56:50.510
The maturity is usually 30
years.

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.469
Then you'd have to be told how
much the mortgage is for.

00:56:53.469 --> 00:56:56.878
Then you can figure out what
does the guy have to pay every

00:56:56.878 --> 00:56:57.289
year.
 

00:56:57.289 --> 00:57:00.722
You just figure out the annuity
payment that at this interest

00:57:00.722 --> 00:57:04.039
rate makes his payments have
present value at this interest

00:57:04.039 --> 00:57:05.869
rate equal to the principal.
 

00:57:05.869 --> 00:57:08.949
So we just saw it was 8,888 a
year.

00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:12.380
And there's one more little
twist with mortgages.

00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.449
So that's not literally true
what I said.

00:57:14.449 --> 00:57:21.489
Mortgages have monthly payments.
 

00:57:21.489 --> 00:57:32.795
There are monthly payments and
so the monthly rate--at monthly

00:57:32.795 --> 00:57:39.840
rate equal the coupon divided by
12.

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.242
So if it's an 8 percent
mortgage then it means that

00:57:43.242 --> 00:57:47.467
they're taking 2 thirds--
so in this case we'd have 8

00:57:47.467 --> 00:57:52.070
percent over 12 which equals 2
thirds of a percent.

00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:58.092
So the mortgage would be .67
percent, and so then you do the

00:57:58.092 --> 00:58:00.340
monthly calculation.
 

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:02.449
So you have to figure out the C.
 

00:58:02.449 --> 00:58:10.423
So it's the summation over 1 2
thirds percent so that's 1.067

00:58:10.423 --> 00:58:14.411
in other words,
1.067 to the t,

00:58:14.411 --> 00:58:18.929
t = 1 to 360 has to = 100,000.
 

00:58:18.929 --> 00:58:21.768
That's how much you'd have to
pay every month.

00:58:21.768 --> 00:58:31.298
And so it wouldn't be 8,888 a
year it'd be slightly more than

00:58:31.298 --> 00:58:36.699
8,888 divided by 12 every month.
 

00:58:36.699 --> 00:58:39.530
This is the last of these
definitions for today's class.

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:43.137
So everybody who's on Wall
Street knows what a perpetuity

00:58:43.137 --> 00:58:47.070
is, and they know how to compute
its value at a given interest

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:47.650
rate.
 

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.523
They know what an annuity is
and how to compute its present

00:58:50.523 --> 00:58:50.920
value.
 

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.340
A mortgage is almost the same
thing as an annuity,

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:59.396
the only twist is that the
mortgage is computed monthly

00:58:59.396 --> 00:59:03.175
instead of annually,
using a monthly interest rate,

00:59:03.175 --> 00:59:05.670
but when they say the monthly
interest rate,

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:08.402
instead of telling you the
monthly interest rate they tell

00:59:08.402 --> 00:59:10.369
you the monthly interest rate
times 12.

00:59:10.369 --> 00:59:12.730
It's just a convention.
 

00:59:12.730 --> 00:59:16.130
All right, so those are all the
things you have to memorize.

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:21.643
Now, let's try to use the way
we can think and do some

00:59:21.643 --> 00:59:24.349
practical problems here.
 

00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:29.034
So here's one of the simplest
and most important ones is let's

00:59:29.034 --> 00:59:31.340
say you're a Yale professor.
 

00:59:31.340 --> 00:59:33.309
I gave this example on the very
first day of class.

00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:34.909
You're a Yale professor.
 

00:59:34.909 --> 00:59:38.972
When I first gave the example a
few years ago when I wrote the

00:59:38.972 --> 00:59:41.369
notes the average Yale
professor,

00:59:41.369 --> 00:59:43.739
so this was quite a few years
ago, eight or nine years ago,

00:59:43.739 --> 00:59:45.969
was making 115,000 a year.
 

00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:50.164
And as it happens the average
Yale salary now is 150,000 a

00:59:50.164 --> 00:59:50.679
year.
 

00:59:50.679 --> 00:59:53.940
But anyway, when I wrote it,
it was 115,000 a year.

00:59:53.940 --> 01:00:05.596
So let's suppose this year's
professors are making 115,000

01:00:05.596 --> 01:00:17.456
and let's say your salary will
go up at 3 percent inflation

01:00:17.456 --> 01:00:22.262
every year,
and that's inflation that's

01:00:22.262 --> 01:00:24.079
equal to the general inflation.
 

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:27.137
So your salary is keeping pace
with general inflation and no

01:00:27.137 --> 01:00:27.500
more.
 

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:30.889
So professors,
we're not doing that well.

01:00:30.889 --> 01:00:33.110
So the salary is 115,000.
 

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:35.701
Now it would be 150,000,
but anyway it was 115,000 on

01:00:35.701 --> 01:00:38.541
average and let's say you're
just going to be kept up with

01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:39.239
inflation.
 

01:00:39.239 --> 01:00:41.938
You're going to be told every
year you have a 3 percent raise,

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.329
but that's just going to keep
you up with inflation.

01:00:44.329 --> 01:00:50.326
Now you know you're going to
work for 30 years,

01:00:50.326 --> 01:00:55.150
let's say, and retire for 30
years.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:57.097
That's a little ambitious about
how long you're going to live,

01:00:57.097 --> 01:00:58.599
but let's just suppose that's
what you think.

01:00:58.599 --> 01:01:00.340
You're going to live for 30
years after that.

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:03.420
So how much should you spend
every year?

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:10.518
Well, you can't answer
that--and let's say you want

01:01:10.518 --> 01:01:14.070
level real consumption.
 

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.123
So you want to consume the same
amount every year for the rest

01:01:17.123 --> 01:01:19.126
of your life,
which is going to 60 years,

01:01:19.126 --> 01:01:20.480
30 at Yale, 30 retired.
 

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.780
So how much do you spend every
year in consumption?

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:26.179
Well, you can't answer that
until you know the interest

01:01:26.179 --> 01:01:26.489
rate.
 

01:01:26.489 --> 01:01:34.175
So let's say the interest rate,
the nominal interest rate

01:01:34.175 --> 01:01:39.117
equals, let's say,
5.3 percent about,

01:01:39.117 --> 01:01:44.469
a little bit more than 5.3
percent.

01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:47.260
So if the nominal interest rate
is 5.3 percent,

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.798
inflation you know is going to
be 3 percent and you've got

01:01:50.798 --> 01:01:54.090
115,000 coming going up with
inflation every year,

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:56.878
how are you ever going to
figure out how much to spend

01:01:56.878 --> 01:01:59.090
starting next year when your job
starts?

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:00.789
It looks like a hopeless thing.
 

01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:03.532
You'd have to say,
well, if I get 115,000 next

01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:05.099
year,
I consume some of it,

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:08.335
I put the rest in the bank,
it makes interest,

01:02:08.335 --> 01:02:11.755
it grows at 5.3 percent,
but then inflation is 3

01:02:11.755 --> 01:02:13.938
percent, so I take that into
account and I figure out how

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:15.420
much to spend the year after
that,

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:17.972
but then I'm going to get
115,000 more of that so I'll

01:02:17.972 --> 01:02:20.682
save something,
maybe more from my next thing

01:02:20.682 --> 01:02:23.989
and then I'll deposit that at
another 5.3 percent,

01:02:23.989 --> 01:02:26.170
and I have to take into account
inflation at 3 percent.

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:28.110
It sounds like it's going to
get very complicated.

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.909
How are you going to figure
this out?

01:02:29.909 --> 01:02:33.356
But in fact it's very simple,
and Irving Fisher pointed the

01:02:33.356 --> 01:02:36.268
way to do it and we can now do
it in our heads.

01:02:36.268 --> 01:02:38.722
So Fisher said,
don't figure out all this year

01:02:38.722 --> 01:02:41.556
by year stuff and don't get
mixed up with the rate of

01:02:41.556 --> 01:02:42.320
inflation.
 

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:45.239
You don't care about inflation.
 

01:02:45.239 --> 01:02:47.786
You're going to look through
the inflation and only care

01:02:47.786 --> 01:02:49.130
about the real consumption.
 

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.518
So the fact is you care about
the real rate of interest.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:59.648
So the real rate of interest 1
r = 1 i over the rate of

01:02:59.648 --> 01:03:07.438
inflation which equals 1.053
over 1.03 which is about 1.023,

01:03:07.438 --> 01:03:08.760
right?
 

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:12.391
We're doing things in our head
now so we have to be a little

01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:14.300
bit approximating,
so, right?

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.568
If I divide this by this these
numbers are so close to 1 that

01:03:17.568 --> 01:03:20.512
I'm basically just subtracting
the bottom from the--the

01:03:20.512 --> 01:03:22.420
denominator from the numerator.
 

01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:29.460
If I multiply 1 g times 1 i,
all right,

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:36.927
1 g times 1 r that's going to
equal 1 g r rg and if this is

01:03:36.927 --> 01:03:44.525
.02 and this is .03 then the
multiplication is .0006 so this

01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:48.389
is practically irrelevant.
 

01:03:48.389 --> 01:03:50.972
So multiplying numbers like
this, or dividing them,

01:03:50.972 --> 01:03:52.780
is just like adding these
things.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:56.619
So it's just like taking this
term and subtracting that.

01:03:56.619 --> 01:03:59.791
So when you get a number near 1
divided by another number near 1

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.663
you just take the difference
from 1 in the numerator minus

01:04:02.663 --> 01:04:04.929
the difference from 1 in the
denominator.

01:04:04.929 --> 01:04:07.389
It's pretty close to doing
actually the division.

01:04:07.389 --> 01:04:11.380
So this is about 2.3 percent
interest.

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:14.750
So the real interest rate is
about 2.3 percent.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:17.836
So Fisher would say,
ah ha, use the real rate of

01:04:17.836 --> 01:04:18.559
interest.
 

01:04:18.559 --> 01:04:22.985
You're getting 115,000 real
payments every year for 30 years

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:27.485
at a real interest rate of 2.3
percent, but we know what that

01:04:27.485 --> 01:04:28.010
is.
 

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:33.914
So what is 115,000 of real
dollars every year at a real

01:04:33.914 --> 01:04:36.429
rate of .023 percent?
 

01:04:36.429 --> 01:04:37.969
Well, remember what our formula
was.

01:04:37.969 --> 01:04:39.980
It's the cash you're getting
every year--

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.768
if it were a perpetuity,
you got it every year forever,

01:04:43.768 --> 01:04:47.483
it would just be the cash
you're getting divided by the

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.239
interest.
 

01:04:48.239 --> 01:04:52.106
So 115,000, that's over a tenth
of a million every year forever

01:04:52.106 --> 01:04:55.039
at 2.3 percent interest that
would be worth--

01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:59.208
that's 5 million so far,
but you're not getting it every

01:04:59.208 --> 01:04:59.739
year.
 

01:04:59.739 --> 01:05:02.219
You're getting it for 30 years.
 

01:05:02.219 --> 01:05:10.639
So 1 - [1 over]
1.023 to the thirtieth,

01:05:10.639 --> 01:05:16.400
so what's that equal to?
 

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:22.467
It's no longer 5 million
because that would be getting

01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:28.420
the money forever,
1.023 to the thirtieth is what?

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.929
Student: It's like
&gt;

01:05:29.929 --> 01:05:34.693
Prof: So we said that
2.3 percent interest,

01:05:34.693 --> 01:05:38.289
2.3 into 72 is--2.3 times 30 is
69.

01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:42.570
So because it's close to 0 the
69 rule almost works.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:46.237
So anyway, an approximation
would say 2.3 into 72 is just a

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:49.759
little bit over 30,
so it doubles every 30 years

01:05:49.759 --> 01:05:55.730
and you've got it for 30 years,
so it's just going to be 2.

01:05:55.730 --> 01:06:00.039
This number's about 2,
right, 2.3 percent into 72 is

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:03.588
approximately 30,
so every 30 years at this

01:06:03.588 --> 01:06:06.039
interest rate it doubles.
 

01:06:06.039 --> 01:06:13.518
So therefore you've got 115,000
over .023 times 1 - 1 half.

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:17.179
You've lost half the value by
not getting it forever.

01:06:17.179 --> 01:06:19.550
So that's 2.5 million.
 

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:22.179
So Fisher says,
look, remember the budget set.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:24.090
In GE we studied budget sets.
 

01:06:24.090 --> 01:06:28.420
We put P_1
X_1 P_2

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:32.750
X_2 P_60
X_60,

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:36.614
that's on the left hand side,
is less than or equal to

01:06:36.614 --> 01:06:40.259
P_1 endowment 1
P_2 endowment 2

01:06:40.259 --> 01:06:43.030
P_30 times endowment
30.

01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:47.909
You're getting 115,000 of real
goods every year for 30 years.

01:06:47.909 --> 01:06:50.639
P_1 is 1 over 1.023.
 

01:06:50.639 --> 01:06:54.179
P_2 is 1 over 1.023
squared etcetera.

01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:59.601
So this revenue on the right is
just the annuity of 30 years of

01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:01.699
115,000 of real goods.
 

01:07:01.699 --> 01:07:06.492
So it's worth 5 million reduced
because it's not a perpetuity,

01:07:06.492 --> 01:07:10.737
it's only an annuity for 30
years and so it's worth 2.5

01:07:10.737 --> 01:07:11.679
million.
 

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:13.550
So we've got the right hand
side.

01:07:13.550 --> 01:07:17.840
That's this, 2.5 million.
 

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.210
That's how much the present
value is.

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:23.318
So that's what a professor at
Yale can look forward to his

01:07:23.318 --> 01:07:25.603
entire,
her entire career if she

01:07:25.603 --> 01:07:28.079
started 10 or 20 years ago would
be,

01:07:28.079 --> 01:07:30.760
she'll make 2 and 1 half
million in present value terms.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.840
If she'd gone to Wall Street,
in five years,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.438
if she were a Yale
undergraduate and went to Wall

01:07:36.438 --> 01:07:38.217
Street,
in five or ten years she'd be

01:07:38.217 --> 01:07:39.670
making more than that every
year.

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:44.159
So well, not everybody,
but anyway.

01:07:44.159 --> 01:07:50.556
So how much should she spend
every single year of her 60,

01:07:50.556 --> 01:07:51.699
or life?
 

01:07:51.699 --> 01:07:55.969
Well, so we have to figure out
this number C,

01:07:55.969 --> 01:07:57.909
the coupon, right?
 

01:07:57.909 --> 01:08:04.947
We have to figure out how much
can she spend every year of her

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:11.987
life, what C can she spend at
2.3 percent interest where now I

01:08:11.987 --> 01:08:14.179
have a 60 here?
 

01:08:14.179 --> 01:08:19.376
So it's an annuity of 60 years
of constant consumption at this

01:08:19.376 --> 01:08:22.868
interest rate,
so how much is it worth?

01:08:22.868 --> 01:08:29.189
Well, I have to just figure out
1.023 to the sixtieth,

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:35.747
1.023 to the thirtieth was
2,1.023 to the sixtieth is 4,

01:08:35.747 --> 01:08:38.609
so this is 1 fourth.
 

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:41.868
So we have 3 quarters here.
 

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:47.659
So this is C over .023 times 3
quarters.

01:08:47.659 --> 01:08:48.698
That's what we have.
 

01:08:48.698 --> 01:08:52.198
So we multiply 4 thirds by 2.5
million.

01:08:52.198 --> 01:09:09.863
You get 10 million--this is
.023 divided by 3 times 10

01:09:09.863 --> 01:09:14.529
million = C.
 

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:20.604
So that's like 76,000
something, 3 into .023 is 76 and

01:09:20.604 --> 01:09:27.826
then you have to figure out what
decimal place you're at and you

01:09:27.826 --> 01:09:32.868
know it's going to be less than
115,000.

01:09:32.868 --> 01:09:37.167
So it's got to be some number,
some reasonable percentage of

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:39.789
115,000 so it works out to
76,000.

01:09:39.789 --> 01:09:40.350
So that's it.
 

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.460
You can do that in your head.
 

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.390
I mean, not today but after
looking at it by next time

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.658
you'll be able to do that in
your head.

01:09:46.658 --> 01:09:49.789
So this professor can figure
out what you should do.

01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:50.899
It seems like a hard problem.
 

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:51.810
It's life.
 

01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:55.679
You've got to figure out what
to do every year and now you

01:09:55.679 --> 01:09:59.819
know how to do it very easily,
so any questions about this?

01:09:59.819 --> 01:10:03.979
I want to do one more little
example.

01:10:03.979 --> 01:10:08.750
All right, so let's do a harder
example.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:11.399
It's easier computationally,
but harder conceptually.

01:10:11.399 --> 01:10:16.421
When I just got tenure at Yale,
actually I had tenure for a few

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:18.859
years;
you'll see why this is relevant.

01:10:18.859 --> 01:10:21.135
The President,
Benno Schmidt,

01:10:21.135 --> 01:10:24.302
of Yale said,
"A horrible thing has

01:10:24.302 --> 01:10:25.359
happened.
 

01:10:25.359 --> 01:10:29.800
Generations of Yale presidents
before me have not realized that

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:33.310
the buildings were not getting
the proper care.

01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:35.020
There's deferred maintenance.
 

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:38.279
Generation after generation did
no fixing up of the buildings.

01:10:38.279 --> 01:10:41.534
I'm the first president who's
going to act responsibly and fix

01:10:41.534 --> 01:10:42.868
up the buildings."
 

01:10:42.868 --> 01:10:50.341
And he said,
"I'm going to fix up the

01:10:50.341 --> 01:10:54.493
buildings,
and I can tell you that I've

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:58.551
hired these planners,
and they've come and done an

01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:04.292
exhaustive study and we have to
spend 100 million a year for 10

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:08.409
years,
each year for 10 years,

01:11:08.409 --> 01:11:13.960
to fix up the buildings
properly."

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.220
So that plan,
by the way, is the thing that

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:18.590
got turned into fixing one
college a year.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:22.010
"So 100 million for 10
years that's what we need.

01:11:22.010 --> 01:11:24.590
These presidents before me have
overlooked it.

01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:26.899
They've spent as if we don't
have to keep up the buildings.

01:11:26.899 --> 01:11:28.399
I've recognized the problem.
 

01:11:28.399 --> 01:11:29.738
I'm going to correct it.
 

01:11:29.738 --> 01:11:32.100
This is a huge expense they
didn't take into account.

01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:33.810
We have to reduce the
budget."

01:11:33.810 --> 01:11:35.840
So how much do you reduce the
budget by?

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.750
How many cuts should he have
made in that first year?

01:11:40.750 --> 01:11:42.930
How would you have figured out
what to do?

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:46.113
So what he did is he
recommended firing 15 percent of

01:11:46.113 --> 01:11:48.868
the faculty which didn't go over
very well.

01:11:48.868 --> 01:11:52.052
And the faculty,
it was an amazing thing,

01:11:52.052 --> 01:11:54.520
there's no structure at Yale.
 

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.989
The president runs Yale.
 

01:11:55.989 --> 01:11:57.460
There's no senate.
 

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.529
There's no labor union.
 

01:11:58.529 --> 01:11:59.659
There's no nothing.
 

01:11:59.659 --> 01:12:00.760
It's just the president.
 

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.735
Suppose the president
announces, "I'm going to

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.238
get rid of 15 percent of
faculty,"

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:05.779
what is the faculty supposed to
do?

01:12:05.779 --> 01:12:07.908
There's no mechanism.
 

01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:10.376
So what happened is,
the old deans who are no longer

01:12:10.376 --> 01:12:12.987
deans, they were just old,
almost all of them were men,

01:12:12.987 --> 01:12:14.390
again, I guess,
old guys.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:16.479
They got together and said,
"Well, we have no power.

01:12:16.479 --> 01:12:19.109
We have no position,
but we used to be deans at

01:12:19.109 --> 01:12:19.510
Yale.
 

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:21.319
It's up to us to do something.
 

01:12:21.319 --> 01:12:24.100
We're going to appoint the
committee who's going to examine

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.020
the logic of the president's
decision.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:28.972
So we're going to appoint six
people that we're going to pick

01:12:28.972 --> 01:12:31.581
out of the blue and they're
going make a report to the

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.600
faculty and tell us what to
do."

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:39.894
So I was one of the six and the
other five guys were pretty

01:12:39.894 --> 01:12:40.979
nervous.
 

01:12:40.979 --> 01:12:43.934
Well, we all were nervous about
actually getting up in front of

01:12:43.934 --> 01:12:46.792
the president and the provost
and the dean and saying that it

01:12:46.792 --> 01:12:48.890
was all wrong and he shouldn't
do this,

01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:54.002
but we had tenure so we could
get up and say whatever the hell

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.260
we wanted to.
 

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.430
So what did I say?
 

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:58.479
What would you have said if you
were me?

01:12:58.479 --> 01:13:06.677
Now the whole budget of Yale
was--1 billion equals annual

01:13:06.677 --> 01:13:13.118
budget, and a lot of things you
can't cut.

01:13:13.118 --> 01:13:18.261
So notice 1 hundred million a
year is 10 percent of the annual

01:13:18.261 --> 01:13:19.020
budget.
 

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.867
So he basically said,
"Well, we've got 100

01:13:21.867 --> 01:13:22.920
million a year.
 

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.810
We ought to cut out 10 percent
of the budget,

01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:27.840
and since there are some things
we can't get rid of,

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.649
we've got to keep making fixed
payments and the faculty is

01:13:30.649 --> 01:13:32.458
something--
of course I'm not going to fire

01:13:32.458 --> 01:13:34.666
the tenured faculty,
I'm going to fire people who

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:37.715
aren't tenured and when faculty
retire I just won't hire anyone

01:13:37.715 --> 01:13:38.649
to replace them.
 

01:13:38.649 --> 01:13:40.119
That's how I'm going to get rid
of the faculty."

01:13:40.119 --> 01:13:41.659
That's how he got to 15 percent.
 

01:13:41.659 --> 01:13:44.350
So what would you have done?
 

01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:45.810
What would you have said if you
were me?

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.985
"Don't do it,"
but what else would you have

01:13:47.985 --> 01:13:48.279
said.
 

01:13:48.279 --> 01:13:51.350
What calculation could you do?
 

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:55.539
So you know now what to say yet
you can't think of what to say.

01:13:55.539 --> 01:13:57.250
So what would you say?
 

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:03.069
I'll come to you in a second.
 

01:14:03.069 --> 01:14:04.090
What's a reasonable number?
 

01:14:04.090 --> 01:14:10.359
How would you think of a
reasonable number?

01:14:10.359 --> 01:14:12.229
Let's take his facts as correct.
 

01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:14.529
In fact they didn't turn out to
be that far off.

01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:21.255
The people he hired were pretty
good at assessing how much stuff

01:14:21.255 --> 01:14:23.390
needed to be done.
 

01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:24.069
Yes?
 

01:14:24.069 --> 01:14:26.869
Student: Well,
I guess the first thing you do

01:14:26.869 --> 01:14:30.329
is figure out what a 10 year 100
million dollar annuity would be

01:14:30.329 --> 01:14:30.880
worth.
 

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.670
Prof: Yeah,
and then what?

01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:36.220
Student: I don't know.
 

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.078
Prof: So that's a good
start.

01:14:38.078 --> 01:14:42.069
He says the first thing he'd do
is he'd think about what a 10

01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:45.659
year annuity at 100 million
dollars a year is worth.

01:14:45.659 --> 01:14:46.909
So why would he want to do that?
 

01:14:46.909 --> 01:14:47.710
So that's good.
 

01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:49.380
That's what he should do.
 

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:53.114
That's how I started,
but what's the relevance of

01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:53.659
that?
 

01:14:53.659 --> 01:14:54.569
Yep?
 

01:14:54.569 --> 01:14:58.560
Student: Then if he got
that lump sum now he could

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:01.840
afford it without needing to
fire everybody.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.770
Prof: So he could say
alumni,

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:06.109
please do something about,
you know,

01:15:06.109 --> 01:15:08.606
it's 1 billion dollars,
not quite, something less than

01:15:08.606 --> 01:15:09.550
1 billion dollars.
 

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:10.770
We'll figure it out in a minute.
 

01:15:10.770 --> 01:15:14.747
So alumni please hand over 3
quarters of 1 billion dollars

01:15:14.747 --> 01:15:17.399
and I won't have to fire my
faculty.

01:15:17.399 --> 01:15:19.529
He could try that.
 

01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:22.310
What if the alumni didn't come
through?

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.188
I know you're going to say
something, but I want to give a

01:15:24.188 --> 01:15:25.539
couple more people a chance back
there.

01:15:25.539 --> 01:15:26.488
Yep?
 

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:30.971
Student: It might be
cheaper to short an annuity,

01:15:30.971 --> 01:15:35.046
and that way it definitely
turns out to be less and

01:15:35.046 --> 01:15:37.408
&gt;
 

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.659
Prof: So you'd short a
10 year annuity.

01:15:39.659 --> 01:15:41.010
Student: Yes.
 

01:15:41.010 --> 01:15:42.810
Prof: What were you
going to say?

01:15:42.810 --> 01:15:45.439
Student: We're going to
have to pay for the colleges for

01:15:45.439 --> 01:15:47.635
like 10 years or 12 years,
however many years you're

01:15:47.635 --> 01:15:49.826
renovating them,
but the faculty are like

01:15:49.826 --> 01:15:50.698
perpetuities.
 

01:15:50.698 --> 01:15:52.408
You have to pay for them the
entire time.

01:15:52.408 --> 01:15:57.153
So if you calculate the C over
i for a professor it's probably

01:15:57.153 --> 01:16:00.029
a lot more than he was
estimating,

01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:04.358
and see how many of those it
would take to compensate for the

01:16:04.358 --> 01:16:05.078
annuity.
 

01:16:05.078 --> 01:16:08.319
Prof: Now we're on the
right track, exactly.

01:16:08.319 --> 01:16:09.810
So I'm going to go a step
further.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:10.788
I went a step further.
 

01:16:10.788 --> 01:16:14.000
I said, "Yale is
forever."

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:19.278
So what he's telling us is that
we need to catch up to where we

01:16:19.278 --> 01:16:23.788
should be to make up for all
that lost maintenance.

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:26.262
He's not saying,
by the way, that the presidents

01:16:26.262 --> 01:16:29.368
who built the colleges in the
1920s and stuff weren't paying

01:16:29.368 --> 01:16:31.210
attention to the physical plan.
 

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:33.880
He was talking about the few
generations before him.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:37.863
So once we make up for those
losses and then return to a

01:16:37.863 --> 01:16:42.353
steady state after spending the
100 million a year for 10 years

01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:45.539
we'll be back to Yale in a
steady state.

01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:47.578
Yale's going to go on forever.
 

01:16:47.578 --> 01:16:51.127
So the point is,
why should the next 10

01:16:51.127 --> 01:16:56.167
years-generation pay for
something that's going to make

01:16:56.167 --> 01:17:01.210
Yale better for the whole
infinite future of Yale.

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:04.738
So I said, "How much would
every generation,

01:17:04.738 --> 01:17:07.362
not just today,
but forever in the future have

01:17:07.362 --> 01:17:11.149
to consume less in order to make
up for this one shot problem,

01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:14.546
this deferred maintenance that
a couple generations of Yale

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:16.479
presidents didn't put in?"
 

01:17:16.479 --> 01:17:23.047
So in other words,
I would figure out the present

01:17:23.047 --> 01:17:28.658
value of the 10 year $100 mil
annuity,

01:17:28.658 --> 01:17:37.189
and then I would set that equal
to what coupon perpetuity gives

01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:41.180
you the same present value.
 

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:43.819
So how can you figure that out?
 

01:17:43.819 --> 01:17:47.377
So in other words,
if you lose 100 million for ten

01:17:47.377 --> 01:17:51.658
years that's equivalent to how
much less for every year,

01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:55.069
so it turns out to be quite a
big difference.

01:17:55.069 --> 01:17:57.158
So it depends on what the
interest rate is.

01:17:57.158 --> 01:18:01.310
Now, it happens that Yale has
an interest rate.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.720
Yale always uses this 5 percent
rule.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:08.255
So if you take R = 5 percent
that's supposedly the money

01:18:08.255 --> 01:18:12.625
Yale, after inflation,
is confident that it can get on

01:18:12.625 --> 01:18:14.109
its endowment.
 

01:18:14.109 --> 01:18:15.510
Usually it thinks it can get
more.

01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:19.470
You'd figure out what the
annuity value is of 100 million.

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:20.340
So I'm overtime.
 

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:23.173
So anyway, we're going to have
to--so the punch line is it

01:18:23.173 --> 01:18:25.760
comes to 32 million a year not
100 million a year.

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.698
We'll do this calculation next
time.

01:18:27.698 --> 01:18:31.382
And you don't need to fire 15
percent of the faculty to get 32

01:18:31.382 --> 01:18:32.409
million a year.
 

01:18:32.409 --> 01:18:33.800
So we'll start next time.
 

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:39.000

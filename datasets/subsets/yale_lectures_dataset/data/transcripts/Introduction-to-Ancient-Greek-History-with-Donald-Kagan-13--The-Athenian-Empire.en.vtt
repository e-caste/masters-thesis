00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.124
Professor Donald
Kagan: The period in which

00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:10.882
the Greek poleis were
left essentially to their own

00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:16.141
devices came to an end with the
clash between the Persian Empire

00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:19.480
and some of the Greek city
states,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.511
but which came to involve
Athens at the famous Battle of

00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.719
Marathon in 490,
and I'd like to tell you today

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.470
about the rise of the Persian
Empire,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.940
and its conflict with the
Greeks, and concluding with the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.490
account of that battle.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.608
First, some terminology.
The Persians were what the

00:00:46.608 --> 00:00:52.040
Greeks called them and that was
appropriate.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.698
They were very close cousins of
the people, who lived right next

00:00:57.698 --> 00:01:01.469
to them or among them,
called the Medes.

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.257
In fact, the Medes were the
first of that group--I guess we

00:01:07.257 --> 00:01:12.935
could call them Aryan peoples.
Again, that's a term that has

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:17.219
been abused throughout the
nineteenth and twentieth

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.989
century, as though it was a
racial group.

00:01:20.989 --> 00:01:25.952
The term is a linguistic one,
and they spoke a branch of the

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:28.980
Indo-European family of
languages,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.361
which is designated as Aryan,
and that's all that that really

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.390
means, but they're very,
very close.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.440
In fact,
the Greeks really couldn't

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.342
distinguish between the Persians
and the Medes,

00:01:45.342 --> 00:01:49.499
and so they called them
sometimes Medes,

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.526
and sometimes Persians.
It really doesn't matter

00:01:54.526 --> 00:01:59.530
because, although the Medes took
the lead in forming a national

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.291
kingdom out of a tribal society
and were the first to be the

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:08.810
dominant family on the Iranian
plateau where these people

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.613
finally settled down,
the Persians then overthrew

00:02:13.613 --> 00:02:19.075
them and established themselves
as the ruling group in that

00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:25.697
family under Cyrus the Great,
as he was called back probably

00:02:25.697 --> 00:02:28.762
in 559.
He was called Cyrus the Great,

00:02:28.762 --> 00:02:32.196
because he was a great
conqueror, first making his

00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:37.277
tribal associates the Persians,
the dominant force in Iran and

00:02:37.277 --> 00:02:42.402
then expanding the extent and
the power of what we can now

00:02:42.402 --> 00:02:48.080
call the Persian Empire,
an extraordinary distance.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.621
If we look at the end of
the lifetime of Cyrus,

00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:54.808
one man's lifetime,
is when this extraordinary

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:58.419
expansion, much of it,
most of it, takes place.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:05.530
If you look at the Near East in
the year 550 B.C.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.725
what you find is the Kingdom of
Medea, the Kingdom of Babylonia,

00:03:11.725 --> 00:03:18.020
which is the most powerful one
in the Tigris Euphrates Valley,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.497
what is now Iraq,
the Kingdom of Lydia occupying

00:03:22.497 --> 00:03:26.689
sort of the western portion of
Asia Minor,

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.856
excluding at first the coast,
which was occupied by Greeks,

00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:36.576
but which the Lydians then
conquered the Greeks in the

00:03:36.576 --> 00:03:42.136
540s--that's the picture.
Then there is the people of

00:03:42.136 --> 00:03:48.860
Persia, the Persians themselves
who are of not much account.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.274
But when Cyrus becomes King in
559 he is a member of the

00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:58.410
dynasty which is the Achaemenid
Dynasty,

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.306
and he conquers his fellow
Aryans, the Medes in about 550,

00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:06.569
and very swiftly conquers
Babylonia,

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.231
Armenia, Syria,
Cappadocia, which is another

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:17.429
kingdom in central Asia Minor,
and has already expanded this

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:23.170
kingdom to something pretty much
unexampled up to that time.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:29.659
Now, meanwhile in Lydia,
the dynasty that began back in

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:35.253
the seventh century,
finds that the King Croesus is

00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:40.407
the monarch at that point.
You will have remembered,

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:44.361
of course, that Herodotus'
first book pretty much begins

00:04:44.361 --> 00:04:49.350
its story with King Croesus,
and his decision to attack the

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.490
Persian Empire which is now on
his frontier.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.324
You all remember the story that
Herodotus tells so charmingly

00:04:58.324 --> 00:05:00.682
â€“
the story of how Croesus

00:05:00.682 --> 00:05:03.811
decides he wants to conquer the
Persian Empire,

00:05:03.811 --> 00:05:07.893
consults the Oracle of Apollo
at Delphi to see how he's going

00:05:07.893 --> 00:05:10.032
to make out;
the oracle gives a

00:05:10.032 --> 00:05:13.306
characteristically enigmatic
answer, but he doesn't recognize

00:05:13.306 --> 00:05:17.643
the enigma.
He says, "What will happen if I

00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:24.558
cross the Halys River," that's
the boundary between Lydia and

00:05:24.558 --> 00:05:28.914
the Persian territory.
The oracle answers,

00:05:28.914 --> 00:05:33.181
"A great empire will be
destroyed," and of course he had

00:05:33.181 --> 00:05:36.440
in mind, destroying the Persian
Empire.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.944
Instead the Persians destroyed
his empire, and of course,

00:05:39.944 --> 00:05:43.635
that shows you you've got to
ask the right question and keep

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.140
answering it until you get an
answer you understand.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:54.941
Well, Croesus attacks in 547;
his capital of Sardis falls

00:05:54.941 --> 00:05:58.120
into the hands of the Persians
in the next year,

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:04.111
and so now the Persians are in
control of the Lydian Empire and

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:09.523
on the frontiers of the Greek
cities on the coast of Asia

00:06:09.523 --> 00:06:13.561
Minor.
The conquest of those cities

00:06:13.561 --> 00:06:17.620
takes place in the years 546 to
539;

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.198
539 is a very big year for the
Persians, because in that year

00:06:22.198 --> 00:06:24.870
they conquer the city of
Babylon,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.740
and thereby gain control of all
of Mesopotamia,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.620
another one of the major
expansions of this vast empire.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.351
The successor to Cyrus is
Cambyses and in the years

00:06:40.351 --> 00:06:44.339
between 530 and 522,
he conquers,

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:49.699
amazingly enough,
the Kingdom of Egypt.

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.747
Perhaps the oldest,
but if not, almost the oldest

00:06:53.747 --> 00:06:58.217
of the kingdoms of that region,
fantastically wealthy,

00:06:58.217 --> 00:07:02.350
and in its own right formally a
great empire.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.686
Now, if you stop in 522,
when Cambyses dies,

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:12.635
you see that the Persian Empire
extends on the west from the

00:07:12.635 --> 00:07:17.980
Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean
Sea to the west,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.220
all the way to the Indus River
in what is now Pakistan.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:33.663
From the south really to what
is now Sudan at the southern end

00:07:33.663 --> 00:07:38.686
of the Nile River,
and up north to include the

00:07:38.686 --> 00:07:44.676
European coast of the Hellespont
and the region and the waters of

00:07:44.676 --> 00:07:49.447
the straits,
and the European coast of the

00:07:49.447 --> 00:07:56.529
Aegean Sea and he comes right up
as far as the Danube River,

00:07:56.529 --> 00:08:00.850
nor is that the end of what he
would like to do.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:05.645
Cambyses launches an
invasion of the territory beyond

00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:11.039
the Danube, which was not in the
shape of any kind of a national

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:14.019
kingdom yet,
just an area filled with

00:08:14.019 --> 00:08:18.110
different kinds of tribes which
the Greeks called Scythians,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.399
pushing all the way back into
Russia, all the way back to the

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.259
Caucuses Mountains and perhaps
beyond.

00:08:25.259 --> 00:08:29.990
These horse-riding,
tribal people called the

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:36.370
Scythians, who didn't even
really engage in agriculture,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:41.899
but were still in the business
of living off herds of animals.

00:08:41.899 --> 00:08:46.744
Well, the expedition goes
forward, and it ends up gaining

00:08:46.744 --> 00:08:50.551
the straits in Macedon,
as I told you before,

00:08:50.551 --> 00:08:54.789
or I should have told you those
names anyway.

00:08:54.789 --> 00:09:00.379
The story is told that one of
the generals of the Persian army

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:04.635
is a certain Miltiades.
Miltiades was originally an

00:09:04.635 --> 00:09:09.003
Athenian, but his family had
been expelled in the time of the

00:09:09.003 --> 00:09:13.298
tyrant--or rather they had been
sent to govern the Gallipoli

00:09:13.298 --> 00:09:17.880
Peninsula,
the Thracian Chersonnese as the

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.488
Greeks called.
So, he lived up there,

00:09:20.488 --> 00:09:22.870
and then when the Persians came
and took that territory,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.294
he became a subject of the
great king and he became a

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:28.600
general in the great king's
army.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.412
He and some others were
given the task of guarding the

00:09:32.412 --> 00:09:35.889
bridges across the Danube,
while the king was chasing

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:40.020
Scythians on the other side.
Well, he was unable to defeat

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.765
the Scythians,
who used Scythian tactics,

00:09:42.765 --> 00:09:46.483
which is to say,
on cavalry, stayed away,

00:09:46.483 --> 00:09:52.315
avoided a direct conflict and
did damage with missiles at a

00:09:52.315 --> 00:09:58.046
distance and ran away when they
were about to face a great

00:09:58.046 --> 00:10:02.269
Persian army which could defeat
them.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.066
So, he was gone a long time,
and while he was gone,

00:10:06.066 --> 00:10:09.179
Miltiades said,
"He'll never come back.

00:10:09.179 --> 00:10:12.737
Why don't we just break down
these bridges to make sure he

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.546
never gets back,
and then we'll be free of the

00:10:15.546 --> 00:10:18.672
Persians."
Well, it didn't work out that

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:22.091
way and the Scythian campaign
didn't succeed,

00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:26.907
but the Persian army came back
and Miltiades had to run off and

00:10:26.907 --> 00:10:30.043
escape,
because there was certainly a

00:10:30.043 --> 00:10:33.613
price on his head,
and he ended up going back to

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:36.879
Athens where we will run into
him again.

00:10:36.879 --> 00:10:44.357
So that is the situation
when we get to the turn of the

00:10:44.357 --> 00:10:49.235
fifth century.
The Persians are in control,

00:10:49.235 --> 00:10:55.669
they have gained mastery of all
the Greek states of Asia Minor.

00:10:55.669 --> 00:10:59.121
The typical relationship
between those cities and the

00:10:59.121 --> 00:11:02.639
King of Persia was the same as
all of his subjects.

00:11:02.639 --> 00:11:04.879
He insisted,
in every case,

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:10.048
that the defeated states who
came under his power should give

00:11:10.048 --> 00:11:14.442
earth and water to him as a
symbol of their complete

00:11:14.442 --> 00:11:17.931
subjection to him.
There was no kind of

00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:21.913
relationship to the great king,
except of one of complete

00:11:21.913 --> 00:11:24.771
subjugation.
The Greeks regarded that

00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:27.160
relationship as one of slavery.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.168
But as a matter of fact,
the Persians were not harsh

00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:36.222
rulers for the most part.
All they required of the

00:11:36.222 --> 00:11:39.868
subject peoples was that they
should pay a tribute to the

00:11:39.868 --> 00:11:43.710
king, and it was obviously not
one that couldn't be met.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.247
Obviously, nobody likes to pay
a tax, especially to a foreign

00:11:47.247 --> 00:11:50.312
conqueror, but it wasn't
something that destroyed the

00:11:50.312 --> 00:11:53.823
economy,
and to do military or naval

00:11:53.823 --> 00:11:59.429
service at his command and under
his command as well.

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:04.940
So, if you did that,
they left you alone.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:08.528
At this point,
at the characteristic regime

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:13.741
was to have a tyranny appointed
by the great king of Persia in

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:17.293
each Greek city.
Remember, you should use that

00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:20.320
word in its original concept.
It doesn't mean they were harsh;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.200
it doesn't mean they were
particularly cruel.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.647
They were satraps,
the representatives of the king

00:12:26.647 --> 00:12:30.379
in the region,
and they had absolute control,

00:12:30.379 --> 00:12:34.737
but we don't hear about any
specially harsh treatment of

00:12:34.737 --> 00:12:37.144
anybody.
That's the situation,

00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:41.601
when we will come very shortly
to the beginning of conflict

00:12:41.601 --> 00:12:46.289
between the Greeks of the
mainland and the Persian Empire,

00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:50.100
when the Ionian rebellion
breaks out.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:53.092
But before that happens we need
to go back to Greece and see

00:12:53.092 --> 00:12:56.791
what's going on there.
Remember in Athens,

00:12:56.791 --> 00:13:01.539
the Cleisthenic revolution has
taken place.

00:13:01.539 --> 00:13:09.052
The new hoplite democracy that
I have described to you is brand

00:13:09.052 --> 00:13:15.407
new and very insecure.
Fearful that there are enemies

00:13:15.407 --> 00:13:22.417
within, some of them friends of
the aristocratic families that

00:13:22.417 --> 00:13:27.931
have been defeated and fled,
some of them friends,

00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:33.693
relatives of the tyrants whose
loyalty to the new regime is not

00:13:33.693 --> 00:13:36.429
clear.
So, that's one fear.

00:13:36.429 --> 00:13:40.744
Another fear is that the
Spartans will not accept their

00:13:40.744 --> 00:13:44.259
expulsion, the expulsion of
their friends,

00:13:44.259 --> 00:13:47.396
but will come back again with
an army to try to conquer Athens

00:13:47.396 --> 00:13:49.350
and turn it over to the
aristocrats.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.786
Yet, a third problem,
Athenian neighbors with whom

00:13:52.786 --> 00:13:56.854
the Athenians have old quarrels
may take advantage of their

00:13:56.854 --> 00:13:59.800
beleaguered situation and attack
them.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:04.394
So, that has to be remembered.
Athens is in a very

00:14:04.394 --> 00:14:09.394
insecure spot,
and Herodotus tells us that in

00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:15.645
these circumstances the
Athenians attempt to get help by

00:14:15.645 --> 00:14:20.759
sending a mission to the king of
Persia,

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:25.658
asking for an alliance with
Persia as a way of fending off

00:14:25.658 --> 00:14:30.001
these troubles.
Of course, the king only knows

00:14:30.001 --> 00:14:33.460
one relationship with other
states.

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:37.566
He doesn't know anything about
alliances that have any equality

00:14:37.566 --> 00:14:41.529
associated with them.
He asks the ambassadors of

00:14:41.529 --> 00:14:46.597
Athens to give him earth and
water and then they can be

00:14:46.597 --> 00:14:49.785
friends.
The ambassadors say okay we'll

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:54.095
do that, but when they come back
to Athens, the Athenians are

00:14:54.095 --> 00:14:59.269
outraged that they have done so.
They punish the embassy and

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:05.080
there is no relationship between
Persia and the Athenians.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.990
Indeed, what they feared
happens.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:11.584
The Spartans invade Attica
and as they are doing that,

00:15:11.584 --> 00:15:16.420
they are joined by other states
who have their own grievances

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.764
with Attica,
Boeotia, led by Thebes,

00:15:19.764 --> 00:15:24.408
Chalcis which is a city in
Euboea just to the east of

00:15:24.408 --> 00:15:29.409
Attica and Corinth just down the
road on the isthmus.

00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:34.273
They are all going to attack
the Athenians,

00:15:34.273 --> 00:15:40.990
but it turns out that the
Corinthians balk at this idea,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:45.891
and what they don't like they
say is the notion of installing

00:15:45.891 --> 00:15:48.750
some kind of a tyranny in
Athens.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:53.054
They have had the experience of
tyranny, they have expelled the

00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:55.970
tyranny not so very long ago
they claim,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:01.340
and they are not about to join
anybody in doing the same thing.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:05.575
So, that's one source of
division that prevents this

00:16:05.575 --> 00:16:08.980
coalition from attacking the
Athenians.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.596
But there's also a quarrel
between the two Spartan kings,

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:16.341
Cleomenes who has been there
before and who very much wants

00:16:16.341 --> 00:16:20.279
to take Athens and return it to
his aristocratic friends,

00:16:20.279 --> 00:16:23.701
and King Demoratis,
who for whatever reason,

00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:27.892
is not willing to do that.
Demoratis loses the

00:16:27.892 --> 00:16:32.500
argument, charges are brought
against him and he flees,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.534
and next we will find Demoratis
in the Persian Empire at the

00:16:37.534 --> 00:16:43.753
elbow sometimes of the king,
giving him advice as to how to

00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:48.528
deal with the situation.
Well, because of these things,

00:16:48.528 --> 00:16:52.180
there is no invasion.
The Athenians are now free to

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:56.409
turn against their neighbors who
have threatened them,

00:16:56.409 --> 00:17:01.533
against the Boeotian cities led
by Thebes, against Chalcis and

00:17:01.533 --> 00:17:04.809
the Athenians defeat their
opponents.

00:17:04.809 --> 00:17:10.190
In Chalcis, on the island of
Euboea, the Athenians take away

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:14.840
a chunk of land from the
Chalcidians and plant 4,000

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:20.403
Athenian settlers on that land,
and they do so not as a colony

00:17:20.403 --> 00:17:25.715
in the traditional sense,
not as an apoikia but as

00:17:25.715 --> 00:17:28.761
what the Greeks call a
kleruchy,

00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:32.288
which is this:
these 4,000 Athenians who take

00:17:32.288 --> 00:17:36.297
the land, settle there
permanently, but they remain

00:17:36.297 --> 00:17:39.053
Athenians.
They are still Athenian

00:17:39.053 --> 00:17:41.862
citizens;
they are really functioning as

00:17:41.862 --> 00:17:46.192
an Athenian garrison to see to
it that things in Boeotia are

00:17:46.192 --> 00:17:47.804
okay.
In this way,

00:17:47.804 --> 00:17:52.328
they very closely resemble the
Roman idea of a colony,

00:17:52.328 --> 00:17:56.510
which was typically a
collection of veterans after

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:00.009
conquering some other town in
Italy,

00:18:00.009 --> 00:18:03.170
they would take some of that
land, give it to Roman

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:07.089
legionaries and let them settle
permanently there as a garrison

00:18:07.089 --> 00:18:12.355
on behalf of the Romans.
Well, that's what the Athenians

00:18:12.355 --> 00:18:17.668
do in the case of Chalcis.
Herodotus sort of sings an

00:18:17.668 --> 00:18:21.223
aria at this point about the
wonders of freedom,

00:18:21.223 --> 00:18:25.685
in which he says the Athenians
were no better than any other

00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:29.240
Greeks at warfare before they
became free.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.447
But once having liberated
themselves from tyranny and

00:18:32.447 --> 00:18:35.099
establishing this new
Cleisthenic regime,

00:18:35.099 --> 00:18:39.881
they were able to defeat all of
their opponents,

00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:43.849
and so much for Herodotus'
prejudice,

00:18:43.849 --> 00:18:49.037
but of course as you read his
history, you will realize that

00:18:49.037 --> 00:18:53.962
in one sense at least the
history of Herodotus is a paean

00:18:53.962 --> 00:18:59.150
to the wonders of freedom and
the greatness of freedom,

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:03.330
and the centrality of freedom
as the story of the Greeks.

00:19:06.859 --> 00:19:09.773
By the way, he also praises not
just freedom,

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.812
eleutheria is the Greek
word, but in the case of Athens

00:19:13.812 --> 00:19:20.388
he praises its isegoria.
That word really means equality

00:19:20.388 --> 00:19:23.599
of speech.
He characterizes this new

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:26.590
Cleisthenic regime not by the
word democracy,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.990
which is apparently not really
been coined yet,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:33.330
but rather as what
characterizes it,

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:38.771
is that all citizens are free,
equally able to address the

00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:43.466
populous in the assembly,
and thereby to take an active

00:19:43.466 --> 00:19:47.639
role in their own government.
So he's really praising

00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:51.838
autonomy, self government,
not merely freedom from an

00:19:51.838 --> 00:19:55.003
alien people,
but freedom within the city for

00:19:55.003 --> 00:19:57.240
all the people to govern
themselves.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.029
He thinks that's one of the
reasons why the Athenians have

00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:04.619
become so good at warfare,
because of these changes.

00:20:04.619 --> 00:20:09.278
Now, a new coalition emerges,
also hostile to this new

00:20:09.278 --> 00:20:13.375
Athenian regime;
it includes Athens' old enemy

00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:16.519
â€“
the island of Aegina,

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:23.283
which sits in the Saronic Gulf,
right opposite the Athenian

00:20:23.283 --> 00:20:25.624
coast and,
as I say they,

00:20:25.624 --> 00:20:28.981
have been fighting each other
now for more than a century,

00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:31.220
and quarreling about this and
that.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:36.981
So, the Aeginetans join with
the Spartans and now they are

00:20:36.981 --> 00:20:42.742
openly attempting to destroy
this regime and to replace it

00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:47.190
with a return to the tyranny of
Hippeis.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:52.432
Hippeis has also fled to
the Persians and is protected by

00:20:52.432 --> 00:20:54.180
the king, so that,

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:03.078
if the Persians get involved,
they too will want to put

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:07.073
Hippeis on the throne in Athens,
but the Spartans want to do the

00:21:07.073 --> 00:21:10.337
same thing, and again the
Corinthians will have none of

00:21:10.337 --> 00:21:13.359
that because of their attitude
towards tyranny.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:20.764
Now, threatened even more
severely, the Athenians send a

00:21:20.764 --> 00:21:26.801
second mission to Persia,
and this time the Persian king

00:21:26.801 --> 00:21:31.444
makes it very clear that will
require that the Athenians to

00:21:31.444 --> 00:21:36.568
put down their newly established
democracy and restore Hippeis to

00:21:36.568 --> 00:21:40.535
his tyranny in Athens,
which would make Athens like

00:21:40.535 --> 00:21:44.274
the other Greek city states,
the ones that are on the coast

00:21:44.274 --> 00:21:47.692
of Asia Minor,
part of the Persian Empire,

00:21:47.692 --> 00:21:52.251
and Hippeis in his relationship
to Persia would be the

00:21:52.251 --> 00:21:57.240
satrap of the great king
governing his own city,

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.744
which was, I think,
commonly what was happening in

00:22:00.744 --> 00:22:03.319
Asia Minor on the Greek coast
too.

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:11.924
That's where we are when
the Ionian rebellion breaks out

00:22:11.924 --> 00:22:17.376
in the year 499.
The start comes in the city of

00:22:17.376 --> 00:22:22.935
Miletus, which was of course a
leading city of the Greeks of

00:22:22.935 --> 00:22:28.522
that area for some long time,
a place you will remember that

00:22:28.522 --> 00:22:33.924
was filled with new ideas where
we first hear about the kinds of

00:22:33.924 --> 00:22:36.920
quasi scientific,
but in any case,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.799
rationalistic revolution that
challenges the traditional Greek

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:46.760
way of thinking based largely on
mythology and on theology,

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:51.770
with pure reason.
I don't want to suggest that

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.660
the Milesian philosophers were
without religion.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.366
I'm simply saying they're
introducing something new that

00:22:58.366 --> 00:23:02.103
stands on the side of religion,
and when it comes to their

00:23:02.103 --> 00:23:05.130
attempt to explain what they are
trying to explain,

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:09.943
the physical universe for the
most part--it really does put

00:23:09.943 --> 00:23:14.673
aside religious concepts and
replace them with observation

00:23:14.673 --> 00:23:17.910
and reason as the way to do
things.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.680
So, what we are seeing of
course in Miletus is the birth

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:25.451
of philosophy at the same time
as we are seeing the birth of

00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:29.221
natural science,
and these do not get separated

00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:32.460
until many, many,
many years later on;

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.436
they are together.
That's the city where the

00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:37.434
rebellion starts.
It has nothing to do with

00:23:37.434 --> 00:23:40.163
philosophers;
it has to do with the tyrant of

00:23:40.163 --> 00:23:43.477
Miletus, a Milesian by the name
of Aristagoras,

00:23:43.477 --> 00:23:46.720
who gets into trouble with the
great king.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.262
He has talked the great king
into an expedition that he

00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:56.057
wanted to launch against the
island of Naxos in the Aegean

00:23:56.057 --> 00:23:59.270
Sea.
He says Naxos is a cinch;

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.887
it's a nice fat place.
They're not ready,

00:24:01.887 --> 00:24:05.521
and if we sail now secretly,
I'll be able to quickly take

00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:08.540
the island,
and the great king will have

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.289
another expansion of his empire,
and of course Aristagoras would

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:17.448
benefit both financially,
and also by the presumed honor

00:24:17.448 --> 00:24:20.180
that he would gain from the
great king.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:25.485
Unfortunately,
the security procedures were

00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:32.635
inadequate and what he was up to
got to Naxos before he did and

00:24:32.635 --> 00:24:37.897
the Naxians were ready.
He was defeated,

00:24:37.897 --> 00:24:42.730
and the great king was not
pleased.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:47.140
Aristagoras knew he was in a
lot of trouble and so he decided

00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:51.623
that this was the time for the
Greeks of Asia Minor to acquire

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:56.045
their freedom from the Persians,
and he was obviously a very

00:24:56.045 --> 00:24:59.530
persuasive talker and went
around to the various Greek

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.343
cities and was able to persuade
most of them to join in the

00:25:03.343 --> 00:25:05.608
rebellion,
which is indicative,

00:25:05.608 --> 00:25:09.124
of course, of the fact that
they were not happy in their

00:25:09.124 --> 00:25:11.809
position as subjects of the
great king.

00:25:11.809 --> 00:25:14.861
So, they rebel against the
tyrants who have been

00:25:14.861 --> 00:25:18.391
collaborating with the great
king and this is an interesting

00:25:18.391 --> 00:25:21.319
point.
They establish democracies.

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:24.964
Now, as far as we know there is
no democracy in the world,

00:25:24.964 --> 00:25:28.801
and there never has been before
the one established in Athens

00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:32.382
just a few years ago.
I think there's a lot of reason

00:25:32.382 --> 00:25:35.900
to think that the idea of doing
that came from Athens,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:39.469
and that is easily believable
when you realize that Athens,

00:25:39.469 --> 00:25:43.349
as I've told you before,
is an Ionian city just as these

00:25:43.349 --> 00:25:46.657
cities, Miletus,
and the other towns that they

00:25:46.657 --> 00:25:50.224
get to join them at first,
are Ionian cities,

00:25:50.224 --> 00:25:54.368
and the Athenians are
recognized by the other Ionians

00:25:54.368 --> 00:25:59.289
as the leading Ionian city.
So all of that makes me think

00:25:59.289 --> 00:26:04.173
that it's hard to avoid the
conclusion that it's Athenian

00:26:04.173 --> 00:26:09.930
democracy that is the model for
these rebellious Ionian states.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:13.730
But Aristagoras knows that
he's going to be facing a

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.529
formidable enemy in the forces
of the Persian Empire,

00:26:17.529 --> 00:26:22.423
and so he goes back to mainland
Greece to seek help for his

00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:26.980
undertaking, and the first place
you're going to go,

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.064
if you want military assistance
in the Greek world of course is

00:26:31.064 --> 00:26:33.369
Sparta, and there indeed he
goes.

00:26:33.369 --> 00:26:37.690
Again, charming stories that
Herodotus tells about it;

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:40.874
he goes to King Cleomenes,
and he tells him what he's

00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:44.549
trying to do and he tells them
how rich the Persian Empire is

00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:48.223
and how if they are successful
in this rebellion they will be

00:26:48.223 --> 00:26:52.081
able to seize some of the wealth
in the territory of the Persian

00:26:52.081 --> 00:26:55.756
king and won't that be nice for
Cleomenes and perhaps for the

00:26:55.756 --> 00:26:58.934
Spartans as well.
Cleomenes says,

00:26:58.934 --> 00:27:03.871
"Well, I don't know."
He sort of scratches his head

00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:09.459
and he says, "How far is the
capital of Persia from your city

00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:15.286
on the coast of the Aegean Sea?"
Aristagoras is a shrewd cookie,

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:19.093
and so he says,
"I'm glad you asked you me this

00:27:19.093 --> 00:27:22.810
question."
He pulls out the first recorded

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:27.411
map in all of Greek history,
and presumably unrolls it,

00:27:27.411 --> 00:27:31.228
and he shows it.
"You see, here's Miletus and

00:27:31.228 --> 00:27:35.626
then here's this royal road and
if you take it down here,

00:27:35.626 --> 00:27:39.160
here is Susa,
the capital of the Persian."

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.647
He says, "How far is that?
How long will it take me to

00:27:42.647 --> 00:27:46.539
march from the coast to there?"
He says, "Three months."

00:27:46.539 --> 00:27:50.658
Cleomenes says,
"Stranger get out of town by

00:27:50.658 --> 00:27:53.074
dark."
The idea of suggesting to the

00:27:53.074 --> 00:27:56.680
Spartans that they should launch
an expedition across a sea,

00:27:56.680 --> 00:28:01.433
which will then take their army
three months to march away from

00:28:01.433 --> 00:28:04.500
the coast, not to mention from
Sparta,

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.722
leaving the city,
of course, open to a helot

00:28:07.722 --> 00:28:10.569
rebellion all the time they're
gone,

00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:13.750
that is not a very welcome
suggestion.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:16.334
So, Aristagoras says,
well, you know it's not really

00:28:16.334 --> 00:28:18.584
so bad;
they got this good road,

00:28:18.584 --> 00:28:22.620
besides I have here some
several minae of silver

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.329
that I'm glad to give to you,
you might want to think again;

00:28:27.329 --> 00:28:30.909
and he keeps raising the amount
that he's prepared to bribe

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.063
Cleomenes.
At a certain point,

00:28:33.063 --> 00:28:37.229
Cleomenes' little daughter,
Gorgo, has been sitting there

00:28:37.229 --> 00:28:40.901
all the time,
and being a Spartan girl,

00:28:40.901 --> 00:28:46.559
she gets up to her father and
says, father ask this man to

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:50.529
leave at once or he will corrupt
you.

00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:54.560
Cleomenes accepted the
admonition from his nine year

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.799
old daughter and sent
Aristagoras away.

00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:01.650
So, the effort to gain Spartan
support in this rebellion

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.765
failed.
Well, Aristagoras says,

00:29:04.765 --> 00:29:08.584
okay I'll try Athens;
now, Athens of course he's got

00:29:08.584 --> 00:29:12.409
a much better shot.
The first place Athens is an

00:29:12.409 --> 00:29:16.259
Ionian city, unlike the Dorian
Spartans;

00:29:16.259 --> 00:29:20.311
second place Athens sits on the
seashore closer to Persia,

00:29:20.311 --> 00:29:24.538
right on the Aegean Sea,
and obviously can feel that

00:29:24.538 --> 00:29:29.823
there is a certain danger that
might be coming from Persia in

00:29:29.823 --> 00:29:32.653
any case,
just because the Persians keep

00:29:32.653 --> 00:29:36.140
expanding and they're now
sitting right on the Aegean Sea.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:39.769
So, for these reasons,
and perhaps others,

00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:44.904
maybe they were already--I was
going to suggest--maybe they

00:29:44.904 --> 00:29:49.774
were already involved with
Aristagoras and the rebels of

00:29:49.774 --> 00:29:57.819
the Greek cities of Asia Minor,
because of the democracy idea.

00:29:57.819 --> 00:30:00.395
That gives me the suggestion
that there's been some

00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:03.938
communication.
Anyway, whether that's true or

00:30:03.938 --> 00:30:09.466
not, the Athenians vote to send
a fleet and soldiers to assist

00:30:09.466 --> 00:30:14.450
Miletus and the other cities in
their rebellion and they

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.327
send--well,
I'll come back to what they

00:30:17.327 --> 00:30:20.424
send in a moment.
Herodotus decides it's time

00:30:20.424 --> 00:30:24.019
to make a point;
he says, this shows how much

00:30:24.019 --> 00:30:28.512
easier it is to deceive many
people, rather than one,

00:30:28.512 --> 00:30:32.660
because by this count it has
got to be wrong;

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:37.880
there were 30,000 Athenians who
were involved in this decision.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:42.279
That's certainly far too many,
and they were fooled by

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:45.267
Aristagoras, whereas,
King Cleomenes,

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:48.521
the one man was not.
However that may be,

00:30:48.521 --> 00:30:51.740
what the Athenians voted was to
send twenty ships.

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:56.779
Now, some scholars would have
said, only 20 ships.

00:30:56.779 --> 00:30:59.759
The "only" is really,
I think, a mistake.

00:30:59.759 --> 00:31:04.449
They are led to that by knowing
that later in the fifth century

00:31:04.449 --> 00:31:08.079
the Athenians will end up having
400 triremes,

00:31:08.079 --> 00:31:11.442
but that's many years later,
that's after a victory over the

00:31:11.442 --> 00:31:13.789
Persians.
That's in a totally new world.

00:31:13.789 --> 00:31:19.326
Best guess I would have now is
that all the ships the Athenians

00:31:19.326 --> 00:31:24.353
had were maybe fifty.
So, sending twenty was not a

00:31:24.353 --> 00:31:28.920
trivial contribution.
Why did they do it?

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.953
Well, for all the reasons
I've suggested,

00:31:30.953 --> 00:31:34.776
they care about the Ionians.
They are their relatives in

00:31:34.776 --> 00:31:37.776
their own mind.
Moreover, they are not very

00:31:37.776 --> 00:31:41.235
friendly to Persia after the
exchanges they have had with the

00:31:41.235 --> 00:31:44.636
great king in which it's clear
the only way to deal with the

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:47.000
great king is to become his
subject,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.910
something they're not eager to
do.

00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:53.206
Another thing that we need to
take into account is that the

00:31:53.206 --> 00:31:57.428
Athenians, remember at least
back to the time of Solon and

00:31:57.428 --> 00:32:01.678
possibly before,
have been increasingly engaged

00:32:01.678 --> 00:32:05.186
in trade with the east,
that is to say,

00:32:05.186 --> 00:32:08.371
with Asia Minor,
with the Hellespont,

00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:10.376
Sea of Marmara,
the Bosporus,

00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:14.013
beyond that into the Black Sea;
in other words,

00:32:14.013 --> 00:32:18.827
into territory bordering on the
Persians so that they have to

00:32:18.827 --> 00:32:23.480
feel that if the Persians are
unfriendly or if the Persians

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:26.849
just do what comes naturally to
them,

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:30.692
they soon may be interfering
with things that we need,

00:32:30.692 --> 00:32:34.369
we increasingly need.
The Athenians will be

00:32:34.369 --> 00:32:40.109
increasingly dependent on grain
and fish from those waters.

00:32:40.109 --> 00:32:45.329
So, all of that can explain
why the Athenians are willing to

00:32:45.329 --> 00:32:49.970
take this enormously risky
decision when the Spartans,

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:54.009
of course, wouldn't think of
doing it.

00:32:54.009 --> 00:32:58.687
Herodotus has this wonderful
phrase to describe the Athenian

00:32:58.687 --> 00:33:02.790
decision.
These ships were the beginning

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.420
of evils to the Greeks and the
barbarians.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:11.677
I guess what he's really saying
is, here we have the beginning

00:33:11.677 --> 00:33:14.049
of the Persian Wars,
my subject.

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:16.857
The Ionian rebellion is one
thing, theoretically,

00:33:16.857 --> 00:33:19.956
if the Athenians had minded
their own business and not

00:33:19.956 --> 00:33:22.994
assisted the rebels,
then there need not have been a

00:33:22.994 --> 00:33:25.324
Persian War.
Heaven knows what would have

00:33:25.324 --> 00:33:27.128
come next.
But in any case,

00:33:27.128 --> 00:33:31.183
I think Herodotus is saying
once the Athenians decided to

00:33:31.183 --> 00:33:34.645
participate,
assist the rebellion of their

00:33:34.645 --> 00:33:38.578
relatives in Ionia,
this was the beginning of the

00:33:38.578 --> 00:33:43.675
Persian Wars for Athens.
Well, the twenty Athenian

00:33:43.675 --> 00:33:49.345
ships land in Miletus and their
soldiers march inland very

00:33:49.345 --> 00:33:53.234
swiftly,
and reach the city of Sardis,

00:33:53.234 --> 00:33:57.376
which is the capital of the
Satrap of Lydia,

00:33:57.376 --> 00:34:03.114
which now a Persian province,
and are successful in defeating

00:34:03.114 --> 00:34:08.593
the forces that come out against
them and set fire to the city of

00:34:08.593 --> 00:34:11.110
Sardis.
So, they've done real harm.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.530
Having done that the
Athenians--forgive me,

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:17.869
I left out a small but
important point.

00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:23.145
The Athenians were joined by a
few ships provided by the city

00:34:23.145 --> 00:34:27.190
of Eretria, another town in
northern Euboea,

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:34.242
an old time rival and enemy
of--what's that other town up

00:34:34.242 --> 00:34:35.250
there?

00:34:38.289 --> 00:34:40.640
I just mentioned it a moment
ago;

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.300
it's gone right out of my head.

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:49.465
Chalcis, thank you very much.
They're old enemies of Chalcis

00:34:49.465 --> 00:34:52.878
and that may account for why
they are eager to help the

00:34:52.878 --> 00:34:55.869
Athenians,
because the Athenians have

00:34:55.869 --> 00:35:00.460
defeated Chalcis and are keeping
the Chalcideans down;

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.817
in any case they do.
A few Eretrians,

00:35:03.817 --> 00:35:08.769
twenty ships of Athenians
accomplish this deed of doing

00:35:08.769 --> 00:35:14.730
considerable harm to the great
king's position there in Lydia.

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.812
Well now,
the Persians launch a thorough

00:35:18.812 --> 00:35:23.274
going expedition,
with the intention of subduing

00:35:23.274 --> 00:35:27.641
their Ionian subjects and
bringing them back to

00:35:27.641 --> 00:35:31.130
subjugation.
Well, it's not all that easy.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.260
This rebellion takes place in
499;

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:43.039
the war against Persia doesn't
end until 494.

00:35:43.039 --> 00:35:46.794
What the Persians are doing is
laying siege to the cities one

00:35:46.794 --> 00:35:49.110
by one, and taking them one by
one,

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:54.380
and then attacking from the sea
and that was critical.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:58.580
If they could defeat the fleets
of the Greek cities having

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.750
already surrounded them on the
land side,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.451
those cities were out of
business and would have to

00:36:04.451 --> 00:36:07.364
surrender.
In 494, the fleet that the

00:36:07.364 --> 00:36:12.590
Persians gathered--the Persians
of course were land lovers;

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:17.914
they had no navy of their own,
but they had a very

00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:23.130
considerable navy provided by
the Phoenicians,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:27.114
who were among the earliest of
the sailors of the eastern

00:36:27.114 --> 00:36:30.315
Mediterranean,
whom the Persians had conquered

00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:34.300
and the Egyptians who had a
naval tradition as well.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:37.545
So, there was a big Egyptian
contingent, a big Phoenician

00:36:37.545 --> 00:36:40.559
contingent, and when they were
under Persian rule,

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:44.679
the Ionians provided ships for
the great king too.

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:45.969
They weren't available
right now;

00:36:45.969 --> 00:36:48.843
they were going to be fighting
against the great king,

00:36:48.843 --> 00:36:51.119
but that's where he got his
forces from.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:55.213
They were numerically superior
and they were very good sailors

00:36:55.213 --> 00:36:59.622
and horsemen.
So, finally at the Battle of

00:36:59.622 --> 00:37:06.793
Lade, off the coast--that is on
the coast of Asia Minor near

00:37:06.793 --> 00:37:10.835
Miletus,
the Persians destroyed the

00:37:10.835 --> 00:37:15.829
fleet of the Greeks and put down
the rebellion.

00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:20.963
Then they took vengeance for
the whole thing by laying waste

00:37:20.963 --> 00:37:26.193
the city of Miletus entirely,
burning it to the ground as

00:37:26.193 --> 00:37:29.760
best one could do that in those
days.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:34.059
So, the Ionian rebellion has
come to an inglorious

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:37.579
conclusion.
What next?

00:37:37.579 --> 00:37:41.576
What next is determined in
considerable part by the

00:37:41.576 --> 00:37:44.610
internal affairs of the city of
Athens.

00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.043
The Athenians are going to be
the most troubled by what has

00:37:48.043 --> 00:37:51.300
happened, and also they have a
reason to be troubled.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.643
The great king like--this is
true of most any great empire,

00:37:55.643 --> 00:37:59.912
or any great power that has
been attacked or even insulted

00:37:59.912 --> 00:38:04.332
by some smaller state,
you just can't let that go by,

00:38:04.332 --> 00:38:09.195
you must punish that action to
deter similar behavior in the

00:38:09.195 --> 00:38:12.123
future.
So, the Athenians had every

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:16.564
reason to fear an invasion or
some sort of attack from the

00:38:16.564 --> 00:38:20.493
Persians in the future.
I think that is critical for

00:38:20.493 --> 00:38:24.300
understanding what's going on in
Athens in these years.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.818
We do have a few glimpses,
just a few glimpses that are

00:38:27.818 --> 00:38:31.336
difficult to interpret,
but may possibly make a certain

00:38:31.336 --> 00:38:34.914
amount of sense.
It is interesting,

00:38:34.914 --> 00:38:40.495
I think, that in the year
496-5, which is to say before

00:38:40.495 --> 00:38:44.837
the battle of Lade,
while the rebellion is still

00:38:44.837 --> 00:38:49.415
on, the man who is elected the
eponymous archon for that

00:38:49.415 --> 00:38:52.929
year is Hipparchus,
the son of Karmas,

00:38:52.929 --> 00:38:56.184
a relative of the
Peisistratids,

00:38:56.184 --> 00:39:02.574
and he is precisely the man,
who tradition says the first

00:39:02.574 --> 00:39:06.380
ostracism was allegedly aimed
at.

00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.562
What is going on here?
Why is the Peisistratids

00:39:10.562 --> 00:39:15.539
Hipparchus being elected at this
point, when in fact,

00:39:15.539 --> 00:39:19.764
we know that the Persians have
said that they wish to put his

00:39:19.764 --> 00:39:22.440
relative Hippeis back on the
throne?

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.269
Why would the Athenians elect
this guy?

00:39:25.269 --> 00:39:28.825
Well, the only interpretation
that makes any sense to me,

00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:32.762
is that you remember that fairy
tale I told you last time about

00:39:32.762 --> 00:39:35.823
the law on ostracism,
and about how I imagined

00:39:35.823 --> 00:39:39.384
Cleisthenes telling Hipparchus
that he could avoid a lot of

00:39:39.384 --> 00:39:41.668
trouble,
if he would join up with

00:39:41.668 --> 00:39:43.652
Cleisthenes.
I think he did,

00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:48.250
and I think his election to the
Archonship demonstrates that.

00:39:48.250 --> 00:39:52.570
It's still Cleisthenes regime
that is in power.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.508
If Hipparchus gets elected
archon,

00:39:55.508 --> 00:39:58.079
it must be because he's on
board.

00:39:58.079 --> 00:40:01.919
All of this is hypothesis,
but it seems to me to make

00:40:01.919 --> 00:40:05.321
sense.
The next event that we hear

00:40:05.321 --> 00:40:11.035
about in Athens that's relevant
to our story is that in the year

00:40:11.035 --> 00:40:14.344
493,
the Athenian tragedian

00:40:14.344 --> 00:40:20.666
Phrynicus presents his play
called, The Capture of

00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:24.469
Miletus.
We don't have the play but we

00:40:24.469 --> 00:40:27.949
have stories about it,
including one in Herodotus,

00:40:27.949 --> 00:40:32.782
and what the stories say is
that the play showed the scene

00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:38.037
of the taking of Miletus and the
destruction of the city by the

00:40:38.037 --> 00:40:41.905
Persians,
and that the play was so moving

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:46.722
the Athenians were made so
unhappy by seeing this story

00:40:46.722 --> 00:40:52.164
that they took measures against
the playwright for making them

00:40:52.164 --> 00:40:59.651
so miserable,
and fined him heavily for doing

00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:02.090
so.
What's that all about?

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.704
Well, there are various
possible interpretations,

00:41:05.704 --> 00:41:09.846
but I think the one that's most
persuasive to me is that

00:41:09.846 --> 00:41:14.213
Phrynicus knew perfectly well
that when he put on this play

00:41:14.213 --> 00:41:18.280
that it would cause great
unhappiness in Athens,

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.670
and great anger.
I think he hoped it would

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:27.530
raise, anger against the
Persians, and it would support

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:32.389
the idea of the Athenians
preparing for war against the

00:41:32.389 --> 00:41:35.453
Persians,
either in the likelihood that

00:41:35.453 --> 00:41:38.749
the Persians would invade,
or that the Athenians would

00:41:38.749 --> 00:41:41.671
have to do something
aggressively against Persia

00:41:41.671 --> 00:41:43.489
somehow.
That's, I think,

00:41:43.489 --> 00:41:46.895
that's the interpretation that
strikes me as being more

00:41:46.895 --> 00:41:49.039
plausible than other
possibilities,

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.500
but again, it's only a
hypothesis.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:58.054
In the same year,
Miltiades comes back to Athens,

00:41:58.054 --> 00:42:05.492
having traveled from his home
in the Gallipoli peninsula and

00:42:05.492 --> 00:42:11.845
he is--think of it for a moment.
What's his position going to be

00:42:11.845 --> 00:42:16.198
vis-à-vis Persia?
It has to be anti-Persia,

00:42:16.198 --> 00:42:20.559
because he has betrayed the
king of Persia;

00:42:20.559 --> 00:42:22.559
he's obviously got a price on
his head.

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:27.797
If the Persians succeed in
putting Hippeis on the throne,

00:42:27.797 --> 00:42:32.941
and making Persia boss of
Athens, his life isn't worth a

00:42:32.941 --> 00:42:36.904
nickel.
So, he's got to be anti-Persian

00:42:36.904 --> 00:42:42.680
and I think what happens next
has to be understood in terms of

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:48.550
the political struggle in Athens
in which--by no means were all

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:53.757
Athenians convinced that it
would be a good thing to war

00:42:53.757 --> 00:42:58.039
against Persia.
I mean it's crazy.

00:42:58.039 --> 00:43:01.425
What I want to communicate to
you is the idea of fighting

00:43:01.425 --> 00:43:04.870
against Persia now is insane.
The Persians have conquered

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:08.360
most of the known world as far
as the Greeks are concerned.

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.257
They have just bashed their
fellow Greeks without a lot of

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:17.784
trouble in Asia Minor.
Why would you want to take

00:43:17.784 --> 00:43:21.241
these fellows on?
What you would want is to avoid

00:43:21.241 --> 00:43:24.404
conflict with them to try to
find some means of coming to

00:43:24.404 --> 00:43:27.838
terms with the Persians.
I'm sure there must have

00:43:27.838 --> 00:43:30.906
been Athenians,
and Herodotus says there were,

00:43:30.906 --> 00:43:34.723
who would have preferred
accepting Hippeis back as tyrant

00:43:34.723 --> 00:43:38.949
and having the Persians be the
real rulers of their land,

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:42.896
rather than all getting killed,
when the Persians decided to

00:43:42.896 --> 00:43:45.624
come after them.
So, you've got these two

00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:47.771
factions;
one pro-Persian,

00:43:47.771 --> 00:43:50.890
one anti-Persian,
and the fact is,

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:55.615
apart from hypothesis,
that Miltiades is brought to

00:43:55.615 --> 00:44:00.343
trial in Athens.
The official charge against him

00:44:00.343 --> 00:44:05.210
is of having been a tyrant in
the Gallipoli peninsula,

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.263
when he was in charge of it
there, and he is in fact

00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:12.757
acquitted of the charge,
which may suggest,

00:44:12.757 --> 00:44:17.041
if the jury was influenced by
popular opinion and had a

00:44:17.041 --> 00:44:20.431
political view,
that the majority of Athenians

00:44:20.431 --> 00:44:23.503
were not willing to take the
tyranny back in any

00:44:23.503 --> 00:44:26.380
circumstances and were prepared
to fight.

00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.920
Now that--interpretation again
is hypothesis.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:33.389
The fact of the trial and the
acquittal are there.

00:44:33.389 --> 00:44:38.985
Another interesting event
is that in the 493-2--that was

00:44:38.985 --> 00:44:41.829
one big year,
that year 493.

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:45.671
Themistocles is elected the
archon,

00:44:45.671 --> 00:44:49.699
the eponymous archon for
the year,

00:44:49.699 --> 00:44:53.684
and we shall see that
Themistocles will play a very

00:44:53.684 --> 00:44:57.670
large role in the great Persian
invasion of 480,

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:03.028
and he will be a participant in
the Battle of Marathon too,

00:45:03.028 --> 00:45:07.739
and Themistocles is a great
champion of the navy.

00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:12.584
He has concluded for varieties
of reasons, that Athens must

00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:16.510
have a much larger navy than she
already has,

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:20.723
and he also is obviously a
member of that faction that

00:45:20.723 --> 00:45:25.095
thinks the Persians will be
coming and that wishes to be

00:45:25.095 --> 00:45:29.309
ready,
and is eager to fight against

00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:32.312
the Persians.
So, Themistocles is on the

00:45:32.312 --> 00:45:35.435
scene and one of the things he
does that looks forward to the

00:45:35.435 --> 00:45:39.253
rest of his career,
is that he wants to move the

00:45:39.253 --> 00:45:42.882
naval base of Athens from
Phaleron bay,

00:45:42.882 --> 00:45:46.148
which is just a beach,
unfortified,

00:45:46.148 --> 00:45:49.369
completely open to attack if
anybody comes.

00:45:49.369 --> 00:45:52.959
So, the Athenian fleet,
presumably, would be drawn up

00:45:52.959 --> 00:45:55.719
on the sands of the beach at
Phaleron,

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:59.490
where you can go swimming to
this very day,

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:03.710
and if those ships are up there
on the sands,

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.949
a Persian fleet comes sailing
up they're stuck.

00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:10.243
What he wants to do is what
he begins to do,

00:46:10.243 --> 00:46:13.327
to make Piraeus,
about five miles up the road

00:46:13.327 --> 00:46:16.954
into the port of Athens,
the naval base of Athens,

00:46:16.954 --> 00:46:20.349
It has three of its own harbors
readily protected.

00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:24.570
If you build walls around them,
if you fortify the Piraeus,

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.010
then you have a port that will
be secure against an attack,

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:32.590
and also be a very good base
for moving out of.

00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:37.938
So, Themistocles demonstrates
what will be his policy for the

00:46:37.938 --> 00:46:43.109
rest of his life in regard to
Athens and the fact that he's

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:48.280
chosen Archon may be indicative
of the mood in Athens,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:53.374
which is increasingly unwilling
to accept the idea of a return

00:46:53.374 --> 00:46:58.190
of Hippeis and of Persian rule,
and is ready to fight about it.

00:46:58.190 --> 00:47:03.084
Well, by now the King of
Persia has decided that he must

00:47:03.084 --> 00:47:08.311
avenge all that has happened and
he must go after the people who

00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:13.152
have done him harm,
Athens number one the little

00:47:13.152 --> 00:47:16.190
town of Eretria,
number two.

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:20.971
He takes a great Persian fleet,
accompanied by a great Persian

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:24.969
army, and starts marching along
the Aegean coast,

00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:30.805
first the east coast and then
crosses the Hellespont and goes

00:47:30.805 --> 00:47:35.658
over onto the northern coast.
He himself is not doing it,

00:47:35.658 --> 00:47:38.110
his General Mardonius is in
charge.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:42.450
He conquers the regions of
Thrace and Macedon on the north

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:47.855
short of the Aegean Sea.
But in 492, while his fleet is

00:47:47.855 --> 00:47:53.679
lying off the peninsula that
contains Mount Athos,

00:47:53.679 --> 00:47:58.099
one of those terrible Aegean
storms that can come up very

00:47:58.099 --> 00:48:01.730
suddenly, does indeed come up
very suddenly,

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:05.369
and pretty well wrecks the
Persian fleet.

00:48:05.369 --> 00:48:10.397
So serious is the damage that
the Persians have to abandon

00:48:10.397 --> 00:48:14.896
their invasion of Greece,
heading for Athens at this

00:48:14.896 --> 00:48:18.211
time.
This, I should point out,

00:48:18.211 --> 00:48:23.658
is precisely the route the
Persians will take for their

00:48:23.658 --> 00:48:27.469
major invasion in 480,
but for the time being,

00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:31.000
that has been put off thanks to
the intervention of the storm,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.280
or as the Greeks might put it,
of the gods.

00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:41.173
Now, as the Persians have
actually begun to make their

00:48:41.173 --> 00:48:45.378
invasion, the Greek cities are
aware the Persians are coming,

00:48:45.378 --> 00:48:49.809
the Persians are coming.
The question is what to do?

00:48:49.809 --> 00:48:53.361
Well the Island of Aegina,
which is unfriendly to Athens,

00:48:53.361 --> 00:48:56.993
you remember from way back.
They decide we're not going to

00:48:56.993 --> 00:49:00.520
be swept away with the Athenians
when the Persians get here,

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:03.210
and they give earth and water
to the king.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:07.139
They have in fact become
Persian subjects.

00:49:07.139 --> 00:49:11.769
At this point,
Cleomenes changes his mind;

00:49:11.769 --> 00:49:15.969
he does not want to sit there
quietly while the Persians come

00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:19.503
and invade Greece,
and so he now goes to the

00:49:19.503 --> 00:49:22.235
island of Aegina,
takes hostages,

00:49:22.235 --> 00:49:25.820
delivers the hostages to the
Athenians,

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.440
and in so doing creates a
rapprochement,

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.865
between Sparta and Athens.
And now the Spartans and the

00:49:33.865 --> 00:49:36.554
Athenians are allies.
That doesn't mean that the

00:49:36.554 --> 00:49:38.869
Athenians have joined the
Peloponnesian League;

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:42.362
they just established friendly
relations after being at odds

00:49:42.362 --> 00:49:44.020
for such a period of time.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:50.192
There is a quarrel between
the two kings,

00:49:50.192 --> 00:49:52.569
as I've told you,
and it's at this time that

00:49:52.569 --> 00:49:56.106
Demaratus is sent into exile and
Cleomenes himself comes out very

00:49:56.106 --> 00:49:59.514
badly.
So, both kings will be in some

00:49:59.514 --> 00:50:04.820
degree of disgrace at the time
of the battle of Marathon.

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:10.186
Well, let us turn then to the
Persian invasion that culminates

00:50:10.186 --> 00:50:15.909
in the battle of Marathon.
The purpose is very simple,

00:50:15.909 --> 00:50:22.669
to punish those cities that
have insulted and damaged the

00:50:22.669 --> 00:50:26.081
great king,
Athens and Eretria,

00:50:26.081 --> 00:50:31.155
to restore Hippeis to the
tyranny in Athens from where he

00:50:31.155 --> 00:50:34.869
can serve as the king's
satrap,

00:50:34.869 --> 00:50:39.791
and surely also,
to gain a foothold in Greece on

00:50:39.791 --> 00:50:43.769
the way to conquering all of
Greece.

00:50:43.769 --> 00:50:46.860
Why should he want to conquer
all of Greece?

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.508
Herodotus tells the story
about his relative,

00:50:49.508 --> 00:50:51.881
he tells him,
for God's sake why do you want

00:50:51.881 --> 00:50:54.606
to go Greece?
There's nothing there but a lot

00:50:54.606 --> 00:50:57.025
rocks.
What is the point of conquering

00:50:57.025 --> 00:50:59.637
the place?
It's one thing to conquer all

00:50:59.637 --> 00:51:03.039
of these rich places Egypt,
Babylonia--that's fine,

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:05.394
there's wealth there,
there's huge populations,

00:51:05.394 --> 00:51:08.651
there's a lot of good stuff.
It's just Greeks and rocks,

00:51:08.651 --> 00:51:11.329
why in the world do you want to
go there?

00:51:11.329 --> 00:51:14.683
The answer, I think in part,
would be Sir Edmund Hilary's

00:51:14.683 --> 00:51:19.387
answer, because they're there,
and that's part of the answer,

00:51:19.387 --> 00:51:24.869
because we must understand that
the ancient idea--in fact,

00:51:24.869 --> 00:51:27.546
I'm willing to say,
the idea that dominated

00:51:27.546 --> 00:51:31.051
thinking about such matters
right down probably into the

00:51:31.051 --> 00:51:33.409
nineteenth century in many
cases,

00:51:33.409 --> 00:51:38.720
but certainly before the advent
of Christianity was this.

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:43.101
That conquest is good.
It's good to be strong,

00:51:43.101 --> 00:51:46.820
it's good to be rich,
it's good to be powerful.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.208
Therefore, it's good to be
stronger, richer,

00:51:49.208 --> 00:51:52.108
and more powerful.
If there's somebody on your

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:55.684
frontier, take them over,
and that by the way will make

00:51:55.684 --> 00:51:59.260
you still more glorious,
because conquest is glory.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:05.190
Now, we in the west--that's
not our natural attitude;

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:08.414
our natural attitude is shaped
in considerable part,

00:52:08.414 --> 00:52:11.260
whatever your religious
association may be,

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.569
by Christianity,
which has been the dominant

00:52:14.569 --> 00:52:18.340
force in shaping people's
thinking in the west,

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.205
as I say, whatever religion you
belong to, and that aspect of

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:26.263
Christianity that it violates is
the one that's increasingly the

00:52:26.263 --> 00:52:28.840
one that's emphasized by
Christians,

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:31.019
and that is the Sermon on the
Mount.

00:52:31.019 --> 00:52:34.439
The one that says the meek
shall inherit the earth,

00:52:34.439 --> 00:52:36.422
not the strong,
and the tough,

00:52:36.422 --> 00:52:38.882
and so on.
The one that says if your enemy

00:52:38.882 --> 00:52:41.740
strikes you, turn the other
cheek so he can strike you there

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.818
too.
Now, if the Greeks had heard

00:52:43.818 --> 00:52:47.170
that, they would have said these
people are lunatics.

00:52:47.170 --> 00:52:49.928
Send them away.
Greek morality said,

00:52:49.928 --> 00:52:53.946
be good to your friend,
do good to your friend and harm

00:52:53.946 --> 00:52:58.559
to your enemies and the second
part is just as important as the

00:52:58.559 --> 00:53:02.199
first part.
So, you need to understand

00:53:02.199 --> 00:53:06.689
that the sort of the ethical
underpinnings to all of our

00:53:06.689 --> 00:53:11.179
natural thinking in the west are
as odd and strange,

00:53:11.179 --> 00:53:15.493
and crazy as they can be for
everybody else in the human

00:53:15.493 --> 00:53:18.570
race, so far as I can see.
There are exceptions.

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.120
I am missing some eastern
religions which have ideas that

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.480
are not altogether in anathema
to what I am saying,

00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:29.089
but what I'm trying to say is
nobody in the ancient would have

00:53:29.089 --> 00:53:32.333
ever had such an idea.
Of course, if you can conquer

00:53:32.333 --> 00:53:35.981
somebody who's your neighbor,
you do and so there was every

00:53:35.981 --> 00:53:39.000
reason to know that the Persians
were coming.

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:47.880
How many?
We don't know.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:53.251
The estimate that most people
would accept is somewhere

00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:57.230
between 20,000 and 30,000
infantrymen.

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:02.409
So, for the sake of splitting
the difference I always assume

00:54:02.409 --> 00:54:07.150
something like 25,000
infantrymen, and some cavalry.

00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:10.175
That's very important even
though the cavalry does not play

00:54:10.175 --> 00:54:12.469
any part in the actual battle of
Marathon,

00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:17.138
but Herodotus makes it very
clear that there was a Persian

00:54:17.138 --> 00:54:21.725
cavalry, that the Persians
picked the site of Marathon to

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:24.962
fight in,
in part, because it was a good

00:54:24.962 --> 00:54:28.795
place for cavalry to fight.
So, there is Persian cavalry on

00:54:28.795 --> 00:54:31.590
board the ships anyway,
alongside the infantry.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:35.590
The two Persian generals are
Datis and Artaphernes.

00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:40.409
They have with them Hippeis.
Hippeis, of course,

00:54:40.409 --> 00:54:44.663
must have been all these years
urging the great king to make

00:54:44.663 --> 00:54:47.599
some such campaign,
and he probably would have

00:54:47.599 --> 00:54:49.519
said, Marathon is the place to
land.

00:54:49.519 --> 00:54:53.506
You remember that's the
territory of the Peisistratids,

00:54:53.506 --> 00:54:57.149
that's where Peisistratus
landed on his last return to

00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:59.830
Athens when he made himself
tyrant,

00:54:59.830 --> 00:55:03.375
that's where his people were;
that's where his forces would

00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:06.091
gather.
I'm sure Hippeis said what all

00:55:06.091 --> 00:55:10.191
such exiles always say.
All I need do is set foot on

00:55:10.191 --> 00:55:14.292
the beach at Marathon,
and my people will rise up as

00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:17.570
one and join me.
You won't even have to fight in

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:20.449
Athens, because they'll be so
glad to see me back.

00:55:20.449 --> 00:55:24.529
This is what King James,
I'm sure, told Louis the XIV

00:55:24.529 --> 00:55:28.822
about getting back to England.
One hears that all the time,

00:55:28.822 --> 00:55:31.750
but it's a very important part
of this story.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:34.720
I don't think we can
understand what happens at

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:38.403
Marathon, if we don't know that
everybody thought it was highly

00:55:38.403 --> 00:55:40.719
possible that there were
Athenians,

00:55:40.719 --> 00:55:44.909
who were eager to restore
Hippeis to the throne,

00:55:44.909 --> 00:55:50.079
and would be willing to engage
in treasonous activities,

00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:54.341
or to defect from the
democracy, and join Hippeis,

00:55:54.341 --> 00:55:57.820
if the circumstances were
appropriate.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.439
So, that's in the back of
everybody's mind or in the

00:56:00.439 --> 00:56:02.871
front.
I think when the Persians got

00:56:02.871 --> 00:56:07.055
there, their strategy included
the belief that there would be

00:56:07.055 --> 00:56:11.029
treason in Athens that would
turn the city over to them if

00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:15.223
the circumstances were right.
So, that force starts this

00:56:15.223 --> 00:56:18.869
time, not along the coast,
as I told you last time.

00:56:18.869 --> 00:56:23.369
It takes the shortest route,
directly across the Aegean Sea,

00:56:23.369 --> 00:56:27.201
hopping from island to island.
Stops at Naxos,

00:56:27.201 --> 00:56:32.396
remember Naxos annoyed the king
by successfully resisting

00:56:32.396 --> 00:56:36.849
Aristagoras' invasion and they
destroy Naxos.

00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:41.048
Next they come to the
island of Delos in the middle of

00:56:41.048 --> 00:56:45.026
the Aegean, the islands sacred
to Apollo and his sister

00:56:45.026 --> 00:56:47.967
Artemis,
a very sacred place indeed for

00:56:47.967 --> 00:56:50.320
the Greeks.
What do the Persians do?

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:56.614
They treat the Delians and the
priests of Apollo at Delos with

00:56:56.614 --> 00:57:00.019
great respect,
do them no harm;

00:57:00.019 --> 00:57:02.650
this is typical Persian
conquests.

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:06.506
They do not impose religions.
Their religion is different

00:57:06.506 --> 00:57:09.210
from that of most of the others
in this area.

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:14.196
They are Zoroastrians;
they are sun worshippers of a

00:57:14.196 --> 00:57:17.530
certain kind,
but they don't impose their

00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:19.637
religion.
They don't interfere with the

00:57:19.637 --> 00:57:21.996
religion.
They get a very nice write up

00:57:21.996 --> 00:57:24.518
in the Old Testament,
if you remember,

00:57:24.518 --> 00:57:27.449
because they don't mistreat the
Hebrews,

00:57:27.449 --> 00:57:32.426
and they particularly don't
compel them to abandon their own

00:57:32.426 --> 00:57:36.389
religious practices as the other
invaders do.

00:57:36.389 --> 00:57:41.739
So, what are the Persians
saying by these actions?

00:57:41.739 --> 00:57:44.337
They are saying we are not
at war with the Greek gods,

00:57:44.337 --> 00:57:46.159
we're not even at war with the
Greeks,

00:57:46.159 --> 00:57:52.024
we are simply punishing these
two miscreant towns that have

00:57:52.024 --> 00:57:56.218
attacked us.
They then turn to the southern

00:57:56.218 --> 00:58:01.219
tip of the island of Euboea,
to the town of Carystus;

00:58:01.219 --> 00:58:04.692
the Persians may be not at war
with the Greeks but they expect

00:58:04.692 --> 00:58:07.937
all Greeks who are along the way
to behave the way they're

00:58:07.937 --> 00:58:11.654
supposed too to the great king,
and so they asked the

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:16.580
Carystians to give earth and
water, the Carystians refuse and

00:58:16.580 --> 00:58:19.699
the Persians obliterate their
city,

00:58:19.699 --> 00:58:23.389
and take their people into
slavery.

00:58:23.389 --> 00:58:28.427
Now, they push their way,
take their sail along the coast

00:58:28.427 --> 00:58:31.449
of Euboea to Eretria in the
north,

00:58:31.449 --> 00:58:35.320
and now here are 4,000
Athenians settled there,

00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:40.668
you remember in a cleruchy.
So, they get their armor on and

00:58:40.668 --> 00:58:46.486
they stand in front and prepare
to die fighting for the freedom

00:58:46.486 --> 00:58:48.883
of Eretria,
because of their wonderful

00:58:48.883 --> 00:58:51.110
friendship to Athens.
Wrong.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:58:54.650
The 4,000 Athenians go home to
Attica.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:58.563
Why?
Well, I suppose the immediate

00:58:58.563 --> 00:59:01.924
answer is why not.
But it's an embarrassment,

00:59:01.924 --> 00:59:05.258
and Herodotus,
I think we have to realize,

00:59:05.258 --> 00:59:10.219
is very friendly to Athens all
throughout his own history.

00:59:10.219 --> 00:59:13.739
I mean, there's no doubt that
he spent time in Athens;

00:59:13.739 --> 00:59:17.119
he seems to have been a friend
of Pericles in later years.

00:59:17.119 --> 00:59:20.698
He was kindly,
although he himself comes from

00:59:20.698 --> 00:59:25.415
Halicarnassus in Asia Minor,
but he did spend a lot of time

00:59:25.415 --> 00:59:29.969
in Athens and there seems to be
a pro-Athenian cast.

00:59:29.969 --> 00:59:33.368
One thing also,
is that many of his sources

00:59:33.368 --> 00:59:36.840
were Athenians,
who told the story their way.

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.452
So, their answer was the
Athenians were ready to fight to

00:59:40.452 --> 00:59:44.000
save Eretria but the Eretrians
said there's no point.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:46.900
Why should you get killed too;
it's not your town.

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.830
Why don't you go home.
If you can believe that,

00:59:49.830 --> 00:59:52.400
you can believe anything,
but I don't.

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:56.404
I think the Athenians realized
there was nothing but disaster,

00:59:56.404 --> 00:59:59.056
if they stayed,
and they could believe if we

00:59:59.056 --> 01:00:01.525
get back to Attica,
we might be able to make a

01:00:01.525 --> 01:00:03.610
contribution to defending our
city.

01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:07.910
Okay, so now here they are at
Eretria, the Athenians are gone;

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:13.001
it's time for the invasion.
The site of the battle,

01:00:13.001 --> 01:00:15.417
where did they go?
Well, they picked Marathon,

01:00:15.417 --> 01:00:18.179
as they say in part,
because it's very near Eretria.

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:21.370
Secondly, as Herodotus says,
because it's a good place for

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.651
cavalry;
thirdly, as I've already told

01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:26.619
you, because it's the stronghold
of Peisistratus,

01:00:26.619 --> 01:00:30.319
the place which would be
natural for an army trying to

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:33.390
establish Hippeis on the throne
of Athens;

01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:36.517
that's why they're there.
Their plan,

01:00:36.517 --> 01:00:40.949
I think, is to go to Marathon.
If the Athenians come out and

01:00:40.949 --> 01:00:45.070
challenge them to a fight,
they will crush the Athenians.

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:48.311
But they didn't expect that.
They thought the Athenians

01:00:48.311 --> 01:00:50.840
would be afraid,
and that what would happen is

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.920
they would stay there in
Marathon,

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:57.577
until they got the news that
there was a revolution in Athens

01:00:57.577 --> 01:01:00.760
prepared to turn the city over
to them.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.060
That's what Hippeis,
I think, led them to believe,

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.484
and that's what they hoped for.
They were prepared to fight,

01:01:06.484 --> 01:01:10.099
of course, but they thought it
wouldn't be necessary.

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:16.460
So, on August 4^(th),
they land in the year 490 at

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.482
Marathon.
We know these dates,

01:01:19.482 --> 01:01:23.568
because there is an eclipse
associated with this,

01:01:23.568 --> 01:01:28.250
which allows astronomers to fix
it pretty precisely.

01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:30.730
The Athenians,
of course, when they knew that

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.887
the Persians were coming and
that news would have come to

01:01:33.887 --> 01:01:36.030
them the minute they got to
Naxos.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:39.146
Ships would have come to
Athens, so the Athenians were

01:01:39.146 --> 01:01:42.026
well warned;
they went to their new friends

01:01:42.026 --> 01:01:44.699
Sparta to ask them for help of
course.

01:01:44.699 --> 01:01:48.000
This is where there are
wonderful stories;

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.783
they sent the great runner
whose name comes down to us in

01:01:51.783 --> 01:01:55.617
the manuscripts as Pheidippides,
chances are his real name was

01:01:55.617 --> 01:01:58.267
probably Philippides,
but there was an error in the

01:01:58.267 --> 01:01:59.791
manuscript.
But we'll call him

01:01:59.791 --> 01:02:01.354
Pheidippides,
because that's what the

01:02:01.354 --> 01:02:02.180
manuscripts say.

01:02:06.030 --> 01:02:09.889
He races to Sparta as fast
as he could go;

01:02:09.889 --> 01:02:13.657
it took him less than two days,
where he came to the Spartans

01:02:13.657 --> 01:02:17.487
and he said, the Persians are
coming, the Persians are coming,

01:02:17.487 --> 01:02:20.185
please help us.
The Spartans said we would love

01:02:20.185 --> 01:02:22.710
to come and help you,
nothing would please us more,

01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:25.719
unfortunately,
we are in the midst of our holy

01:02:25.719 --> 01:02:30.701
religious ceremony the Carnea,
and we are not allowed to leave

01:02:30.701 --> 01:02:36.750
our hometown until the next full
moon, which is a matter of fact,

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:42.105
the night of August 11^(th),
12^(th), in other words,

01:02:42.105 --> 01:02:47.460
a whole week after the Persians
are going to land.

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:51.610
I can't go speculating as to
what are we to make of this.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:55.038
Is this just an excuse?
Are the Spartans serious about

01:02:55.038 --> 01:02:56.830
this?
Our tendency I suppose,

01:02:56.830 --> 01:03:00.220
being modern and cynical,
would be to say it's only an

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.355
excuse.
I'm more inclined to think that

01:03:03.355 --> 01:03:06.990
they were sincere about it.
It's not that they couldn't

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.801
find ways to get round such
things, but they really took

01:03:09.801 --> 01:03:14.739
their religion quite seriously,
and it may be that that did

01:03:14.739 --> 01:03:17.780
play a role.
Be that as it may,

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:20.510
two things that the Athenians
now know.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:23.872
They know the Spartans have
promised to come but not for

01:03:23.872 --> 01:03:26.988
another week.
Both of those things should be

01:03:26.988 --> 01:03:29.920
on your minds as you try to
understand.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:34.724
Now, Herodotus says that the
Athenian army marched out from

01:03:34.724 --> 01:03:38.426
Athens and went to Marathon,
and then they had an argument

01:03:38.426 --> 01:03:40.900
about what they should do,
but I don't think that's right.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.600
There must have been a debate.
There had to be a debate in

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.840
Athens.
You couldn't take an army out

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.659
of town without having an
assembly to argue the question,

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:52.118
should we send an army,
and if we should send an army

01:03:52.118 --> 01:03:55.160
how big should the army be,
and having decided that,

01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.589
who should be in command.
All those things had to be

01:03:58.589 --> 01:04:00.769
settled by the assembly in
Athens;

01:04:00.769 --> 01:04:03.730
so, that is where the debate
took place.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:09.650
Some favored defending the
city of Athens.

01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:15.698
Now, we don't know how well the
city of Athens was walled,

01:04:15.698 --> 01:04:21.639
defended by fortification at
this time in its history.

01:04:21.639 --> 01:04:24.829
It may not have had any walls,
but I would be surprised.

01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:29.508
But it certainly did not have a
wall that was guaranteed to be

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:33.655
effective against an attack,
and so I think we should

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:37.269
understand that is not going to
be successful.

01:04:37.269 --> 01:04:40.952
To stay home and defend Athens
means to allow the Persians to

01:04:40.952 --> 01:04:43.960
run all around Attica doing
anything they want,

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.668
causing all the harm they
could, remember something over

01:04:47.668 --> 01:04:50.956
seventy five percent,
maybe as many as ninety percent

01:04:50.956 --> 01:04:53.590
of the Athenians had farms out
in the country,

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:57.104
had houses out in the country
that would have been exposed to

01:04:57.104 --> 01:05:00.385
the Persians and so there was
good reason for them not to

01:05:00.385 --> 01:05:04.577
think that was a great idea.
The alternative was to send

01:05:04.577 --> 01:05:07.642
an army out to allow the
Persians to land,

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:11.016
because they couldn't stop it;
they didn't know where the

01:05:11.016 --> 01:05:12.898
Persians were going to come,
but as they heard that the

01:05:12.898 --> 01:05:16.116
Persians had landed,
just send an army there and

01:05:16.116 --> 01:05:19.250
meet them at the place of
landing.

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:23.559
Miltiades emerges as the
leading figure here.

01:05:23.559 --> 01:05:28.590
I mean, he is a general,
but that's not the only reason;

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:32.072
it's because everybody knows
Miltiades is the resident

01:05:32.072 --> 01:05:35.542
Persian expert.
He has been a general in the

01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:39.155
Persian army,
and so that gives him a reason

01:05:39.155 --> 01:05:42.370
to be listened to,
but he's obviously also a

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:45.503
person of great merit and
quality, and proves it at the

01:05:45.503 --> 01:05:49.108
Battle of Marathon.
He must have been an impressive

01:05:49.108 --> 01:05:51.049
fellow.
So, for all these reasons

01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:54.157
whatever his formal position
was, and I think it was simply

01:05:54.157 --> 01:05:57.662
one of the generals,
de facto he had much

01:05:57.662 --> 01:06:01.364
more influence than others for
these reasons,

01:06:01.364 --> 01:06:06.497
and his argument was let us go
out and meet the Persians where

01:06:06.497 --> 01:06:10.309
they land.
Other reasons were we don't

01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:13.847
want them to be able to get to
the Spartans,

01:06:13.847 --> 01:06:17.897
but beyond that,
there was fear that if we stay

01:06:17.897 --> 01:06:20.966
home and wait,
and let the Persians do

01:06:20.966 --> 01:06:25.497
whatever they're going to do,
every day that passes,

01:06:25.497 --> 01:06:30.190
it increases the danger of
treason from those people who

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:35.063
want to turn the city over.
It's also so completely against

01:06:35.063 --> 01:06:38.868
the ethic of the Greek warrior,
and I would say more

01:06:38.868 --> 01:06:41.630
specifically,
the hoplite warrior.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:45.300
You don't let your enemy ravage
your countryside.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.019
You don't let them destroy your
farms.

01:06:48.019 --> 01:06:51.239
This in a way goes all the way
back to Homer,

01:06:51.239 --> 01:06:53.800
the notion of
arête,

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.402
a man must have courage,
you must stand up against an

01:06:57.402 --> 01:07:00.470
enemy who invades his country,
and then again,

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:03.758
beyond that you move to the
world of the hoplite and you're

01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:06.139
talking about defending your
homestead;

01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:09.550
all of that argued for going
out there.

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:13.849
So, the modern terminology
I would use to explain what the

01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:18.289
Athenian strategy was to go out
and to contain the beachhead,

01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:21.683
go out confront the Persians
where they are,

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:25.550
don't let them get inland from
where they land.

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:30.920
So, they do land at Marathon
with about 25,000 infantry.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.339
Now remember,
their infantry are not

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:36.829
hoplites.
They do not have heavy armor.

01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:47.323
There are vases that showed the
Persian soldiers at Marathon,

01:07:47.323 --> 01:07:54.494
and they are wearing pants,
as I told you,

01:07:54.494 --> 01:08:01.139
but they're not wearing any
armor.

01:08:01.139 --> 01:08:04.513
Their shield is a kind of
wicker shield,

01:08:04.513 --> 01:08:09.530
so that their armament is much
inferior to the hoplites,

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:12.946
and keep in mind too,
that the Persian army has

01:08:12.946 --> 01:08:17.180
always been made up of a
collection of subject peoples.

01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:20.743
Yes there will be some
Persians, but there will also be

01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:23.779
lots of folks who are not
Persians in there.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:27.140
So, they lack that unity that
the Greeks will have.

01:08:45.659 --> 01:08:50.114
Miltiades' plan is this,
there are something like 10,000

01:08:50.114 --> 01:08:55.111
Greeks, about 9,000 Athenians,
about 1,000 Eretrians against

01:08:55.111 --> 01:09:00.184
let us say 25,000 Persians,
and so as the thing begins the

01:09:00.184 --> 01:09:04.723
map here shows you the rough
picture of the field at

01:09:04.723 --> 01:09:08.791
Marathon.
Here the Persians landed right

01:09:08.791 --> 01:09:13.400
here and had their ships drawn
up at this place.

01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.893
They had their camp behind here.
This marsh ought to be a little

01:09:16.893 --> 01:09:20.210
more over this way;
it's a very serious marsh.

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:22.500
It'll play an important role in
what happens.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.921
The Greeks come out--they
probably came marching in

01:09:25.921 --> 01:09:29.069
through this way and here we
have mountains.

01:09:29.069 --> 01:09:32.149
This wavy line indicates the
line of the mountains.

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:35.583
Here you have a really flat
plain, but here you have

01:09:35.583 --> 01:09:39.487
mountains, and somewhere up on
the hills here there was the

01:09:39.487 --> 01:09:42.112
Greek camp near the modern
church of St.

01:09:42.112 --> 01:09:45.432
Demetrius.
This little dot reflects

01:09:45.432 --> 01:09:49.917
the mound where the dead,
the Greek dead at Marathon will

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:55.134
after the battle be buried,
and that is likely to be about

01:09:55.134 --> 01:09:59.449
the place where the main
fighting took place,

01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:04.859
which helps us to place where
the actual battle took place,

01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:10.454
so the idea of the Athenians
was to try to hold them there as

01:10:10.454 --> 01:10:15.059
long as they could.
The Greeks have the upper hill,

01:10:15.059 --> 01:10:20.748
the Persians are down below.
If the Persians want to start a

01:10:20.748 --> 01:10:26.869
fight, then they will have to
come running up the hill.

01:10:26.869 --> 01:10:29.804
Well, that is not a very
attractive proposition and so

01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:32.020
the Greeks feel,
let them come for us.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:34.760
It's our country.
So, they're sitting here.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.859
They've got to do something;
we don't.

01:10:36.859 --> 01:10:40.770
Meanwhile, the Persians are
waiting for treason,

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:44.680
so that the city will be
surrendered to them.

01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.876
A week goes by with the two
sides looking at each other and

01:10:49.876 --> 01:10:53.286
doing nothing.
I always like to compare the

01:10:53.286 --> 01:10:57.310
Athenian strategy to an old
fashioned football strategy,

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:02.257
which I haven't seen done now
in decades, which used to be

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:05.989
kick on first down and wait for
a fumble.

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:08.285
In other words,
give the ball to the Persians

01:11:08.285 --> 01:11:12.217
and let them make a mistake.
I think that's what was in

01:11:12.217 --> 01:11:14.476
Miltiades mind.
Well finally,

01:11:14.476 --> 01:11:17.466
time passes,
and the Persians realize we

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:20.824
can't sit here forever.
For one thing they're going to

01:11:20.824 --> 01:11:22.827
run out of food and water,
for another thing,

01:11:22.827 --> 01:11:24.920
the great king will want to
hear something.

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.859
Well, how did you do?
What did you do?

01:11:26.859 --> 01:11:28.250
We sat there and watched the
Athenians;

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:31.592
no good.
So, the plan that the Persians

01:11:31.592 --> 01:11:35.234
made, I think was this,
that they would take--let us

01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:39.059
say for the sake of argument,
10,000 troops,

01:11:39.059 --> 01:11:44.555
put them on the ships,
load up the cavalry onto the

01:11:44.555 --> 01:11:50.822
ships too and send those ships
around Attica to come up to

01:11:50.822 --> 01:11:55.109
Phaleron Bay straight into
Athens,

01:11:55.109 --> 01:11:58.636
and meanwhile take the 15,000
that are left,

01:11:58.636 --> 01:12:03.557
march them up as close as you
could get to the Greeks and fix

01:12:03.557 --> 01:12:07.773
the Greeks there,
so that they can't go back and

01:12:07.773 --> 01:12:10.693
defend Athens.
So, there's no army to protect

01:12:10.693 --> 01:12:13.076
Athens.
So if those guys get off the

01:12:13.076 --> 01:12:16.672
ships, come sailing into the
harbor, walk up to town,

01:12:16.672 --> 01:12:19.470
it's theirs.
If the Athenians are crazy

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:23.466
enough, from the Persian point
of view, to come running down

01:12:23.466 --> 01:12:26.853
the hill or walking down the
hill or whatever to be

01:12:26.853 --> 01:12:30.849
outnumbered three to two by
us--and anyway we're Persians we

01:12:30.849 --> 01:12:34.492
always beat Greeks,
we've got nothing to worry

01:12:34.492 --> 01:12:37.989
about, then let them do it.
So they come.

01:12:37.989 --> 01:12:41.609
Now, Miltiades is in charge
on the day of the battle.

01:12:41.609 --> 01:12:45.655
He's got the problem that they
have 5,000 more troops than he

01:12:45.655 --> 01:12:47.486
has.
He's worried about being

01:12:47.486 --> 01:12:50.927
outflanked.
So, what he decides to do is to

01:12:50.927 --> 01:12:56.206
weaken the depth of his line
because he must cover the length

01:12:56.206 --> 01:13:00.035
of the Persian line.
Well, the danger with that is,

01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:03.464
of course, that when they hit
each other the Persians will

01:13:03.464 --> 01:13:07.279
break through the Greek line.
So, instead of making it even,

01:13:07.279 --> 01:13:11.122
he loaded up the wings and left
the center even weaker than it

01:13:11.122 --> 01:13:14.676
would otherwise have been.
His hope and strategy was that

01:13:14.676 --> 01:13:18.185
the Athenians would win on the
wings before the Persians could

01:13:18.185 --> 01:13:21.638
break through the middle and
then the Athenians could turn on

01:13:21.638 --> 01:13:24.399
the center of the Persians and
defeat them,

01:13:24.399 --> 01:13:27.579
and just barely that's what
happened.

01:13:27.579 --> 01:13:30.538
The Persians did break
through the center but they were

01:13:30.538 --> 01:13:33.142
too late.
By that time the Greek wing,

01:13:33.142 --> 01:13:36.569
the Athenian wings were
successful and drove the

01:13:36.569 --> 01:13:40.901
Persians before them,
the Persians ran away like mad,

01:13:40.901 --> 01:13:45.814
but they ran into the great
swamp and that made their escape

01:13:45.814 --> 01:13:50.257
much more difficult.
So, the Athenians were able to

01:13:50.257 --> 01:13:54.806
kill great numbers of them,
and finally that battle was

01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:56.820
over.
Now, the battle was over,

01:13:56.820 --> 01:13:59.983
let's imagine that it took a
couple of hours that would be a

01:13:59.983 --> 01:14:03.045
long time.
The Athenians had time now to

01:14:03.045 --> 01:14:08.183
have a meal, take a little rest,
and march back across to Attica

01:14:08.183 --> 01:14:11.119
before the ships could get
there,

01:14:11.119 --> 01:14:15.850
and I like to imagine the scene
when it all happened.

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:19.528
The Persians coming around
the last bend of the bay as they

01:14:19.528 --> 01:14:22.376
come into Phaleron,
expecting to see a nice empty

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:24.689
beach and seeing the Athenian
army.

01:14:24.689 --> 01:14:31.021
I like to imagine with their
left foot in the breakers,

01:14:31.021 --> 01:14:38.290
and their shields and spears up
with the sun gleaming off their

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:44.270
shields and blinding the
Persians as they came.

01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:46.718
At which point,
you can't force a landing

01:14:46.718 --> 01:14:49.109
against an army;
it just can't be done in the

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:51.094
ancient world.
These guys had to go home and

01:14:51.094 --> 01:14:53.593
start thinking about what
they're going to tell the great

01:14:53.593 --> 01:14:57.883
king.
The Athenians won the battle,

01:14:57.883 --> 01:15:03.310
very large casualties for the
Persians.

01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:08.962
Only 192 Greeks killed in the
battle and allowed the

01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:15.390
extraordinary honor of being
buried on the field where they

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:19.055
fought.
Next day 2,000 Spartans

01:15:19.055 --> 01:15:23.342
come marching into Attica;
that proves they were serious

01:15:23.342 --> 01:15:26.895
and were told what had happened.
They asked permission--can we

01:15:26.895 --> 01:15:29.857
go to the battlefield and look
at it, and there they saw all

01:15:29.857 --> 01:15:32.718
these dead Persians and no one
had ever seen anything like

01:15:32.718 --> 01:15:34.759
that.
No Greeks had ever beat

01:15:34.759 --> 01:15:37.839
Persians before,
and great was the glory of the

01:15:37.839 --> 01:15:40.117
Athenians.
So I've described very

01:15:40.117 --> 01:15:42.740
inadequately and too swiftly the
battle.

01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:46.569
So what?
What is the significance of

01:15:46.569 --> 01:15:51.494
this silly little battle 10,000
Greeks against 15,000 Persians

01:15:51.494 --> 01:15:55.449
back a billion years ago,
what does it matter?

01:15:55.449 --> 01:15:58.800
Lots of folks will tell you
that, especially these days.

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:03.974
But I remember in 1936 there
was a wonderful conference of

01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:10.109
pacifists, who met in England,
at which the dominant theme of

01:16:10.109 --> 01:16:14.092
the speakers was,
no war ever made any

01:16:14.092 --> 01:16:17.446
difference.
What I like about that was that

01:16:17.446 --> 01:16:19.770
the place of the meeting was
Hastings.

01:16:24.279 --> 01:16:27.513
The battle was seen
throughout the rest of Greek

01:16:27.513 --> 01:16:30.874
history, first of all,
as a great victory for hoplites

01:16:30.874 --> 01:16:35.003
as opposed to their opponents.
In later Greek history,

01:16:35.003 --> 01:16:39.295
when the navy becomes a big
thing, it is the party,

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:44.101
the old fashioned and more
conservative party that thinks

01:16:44.101 --> 01:16:47.619
about Marathon as the great
victory,

01:16:47.619 --> 01:16:51.579
the day that those hoplite
farmers saved Greece.

01:16:51.579 --> 01:16:54.481
The navy guys,
the poor like to think about

01:16:54.481 --> 01:16:56.899
Salamis, the naval battle in
480.

01:16:56.899 --> 01:17:00.410
It was seen as a victory for
democracy;

01:17:00.410 --> 01:17:04.991
it was the Athenian democrats.
Later on I'm sure they were

01:17:04.991 --> 01:17:08.669
glad the Spartans never got
there, because they could claim

01:17:08.669 --> 01:17:11.585
it as their own,
and as a victory for democracy

01:17:11.585 --> 01:17:13.797
as well.
It was also the first,

01:17:13.797 --> 01:17:16.319
as I say, Greek defeat of the
Persians.

01:17:16.319 --> 01:17:19.680
As Herodotus says,
for up until then even the name

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:23.109
Persians was a fearful thing for
Greeks to hear.

01:17:23.109 --> 01:17:27.539
It was a source of
tremendous national pride and

01:17:27.539 --> 01:17:31.621
glory for Athens,
and scholars have compared the

01:17:31.621 --> 01:17:36.484
impact of the Battle of Marathon
on the Athenian image of

01:17:36.484 --> 01:17:40.827
themselves with the defeat of
the Spanish Armada by

01:17:40.827 --> 01:17:45.864
Elizabeth's English fleet and
the beginning of the glory of

01:17:45.864 --> 01:17:50.749
the Elizabethan Era.
It was seen as a victory for

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:55.552
freedom, because the price of
defeat would have been slavery

01:17:55.552 --> 01:17:58.890
in every sense,
as they understood it.

01:17:58.890 --> 01:18:01.981
Greek civilization,
and I'll come back to this in a

01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.949
minute, could have been
strangled in its infancy,

01:18:04.949 --> 01:18:08.997
because it is in its infancy.
But again, we ought to pay

01:18:08.997 --> 01:18:13.629
attention to those people who
suggest that people like me are

01:18:13.629 --> 01:18:17.489
over-embellishing the
significance of all this.

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:22.148
One English statesman said
war wins nothing,

01:18:22.148 --> 01:18:25.420
cures nothing,
settles nothing;

01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.619
the speaker was Neville
Chamberlain.

01:18:29.619 --> 01:18:33.739
In 1936 Bertrand Russell would
declare, disarmament and

01:18:33.739 --> 01:18:37.859
complete pacifism is
indisputably the wisest policy,

01:18:37.859 --> 01:18:41.963
and he urged the gradual
disbanding of the British Army,

01:18:41.963 --> 01:18:45.878
Navy and Air Force,
as Hitler was moving into the

01:18:45.878 --> 01:18:49.192
Rhineland.
Does victory in war make a

01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:53.088
difference?
I would say ask the losers,

01:18:53.088 --> 01:18:56.792
the victims,
and the survivors of the

01:18:56.792 --> 01:19:00.507
Holocaust.
Ask the descendants of the

01:19:00.507 --> 01:19:04.640
slaves in the American south.
Remember this,

01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:10.203
if the Athenians had lost at
Marathon--Aeschylus had just

01:19:10.203 --> 01:19:13.779
begun his career as a
playwright,

01:19:13.779 --> 01:19:17.833
Sophocles hadn't written a
play, Euripides of course hadn't

01:19:17.833 --> 01:19:22.460
either, nor had Aristophanes.
Socrates, if I got this

01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:27.596
right--Socrates wasn't born yet,
much less Plato,

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:31.700
Aristotle, Phidius.
There was no Parthenon,

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:35.504
none of those glorious
buildings that make us think

01:19:35.504 --> 01:19:40.069
about the greatness that was
Greece had been constructed.

01:19:40.069 --> 01:19:44.603
There would be no
democracy, because this was the

01:19:44.603 --> 01:19:48.090
only place where it had any
existence.

01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:54.031
The scientific revolution which
was beyond its infancy in terms

01:19:54.031 --> 01:19:57.960
of being new would have been
wiped out.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:00.798
There would be no memory;
there would be no record of any

01:20:00.798 --> 01:20:03.070
of this.
Therefore, no Western

01:20:03.070 --> 01:20:05.968
civilization,
no political freedom,

01:20:05.968 --> 01:20:10.828
for all these have occurred in
no other culture in all the

01:20:10.828 --> 01:20:15.691
years since that time.
That's why I wanted you to know

01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:20.896
a little bit about the battle of
Marathon because I think all of

01:20:20.896 --> 01:20:25.357
us alive today here owe a very
great debt to the 10,000

01:20:25.357 --> 01:20:29.571
marathonomachoi,
the fighters of Marathon who

01:20:29.571 --> 01:20:33.620
fought for Greek freedom and for
ours too.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:34.620
Thank you.

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.460
Professor John Merriman:
Let's go.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.281
Oh, Charles rocks.
Wasn't that good the other day,

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:05.580
Charles Keith,
you liked that lecture?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.748
He's excellent.
He did a seminar on imperialism

00:00:08.748 --> 00:00:14.068
last year, which was very good.
Before I start I just wanted

00:00:14.068 --> 00:00:21.650
to--just to give you a visual
idea of the new imperialism,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.979
that is the period he was
talking about,

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.190
from the mid 1880s,
let's say 1884,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.227
1885 to 1914.
So, what to focus on is

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:32.430
just--when you're looking at
this thing, is there's Africa.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.170
So, you got a few little
splotches, and there weren't

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
even maps of much of the
internal part of Africa.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.170
So, that's 1880.
And now look at this.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.579
That's 1914.
So, something just happened in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.612
between which is that the
scramble for colonies has

00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:58.080
literally eaten up the entire
continent,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.286
and the places that Charles was
talking about was obviously West

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.163
Africa, basically,
here West Africa,

00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:07.962
and now Mali,
and Senegal,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.409
and Algeria,
obviously Morocco,

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.880
and Tunisia,
and that sort of thing.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.189
And then the rest you just see.
But it's an extraordinary

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.877
contrast in there.
And there's Fashoda which is

00:01:25.877 --> 00:01:29.750
where the two expeditionary
forces stumble into each other,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.925
and there's a thought of war,
and they settle it there with a

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:40.273
few drinks, but then the foreign
ministers go wild and it's all

00:01:40.273 --> 00:01:44.110
that.
So, just to remind you of the

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.954
context.
So, that's what I'm going to

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:47.500
talk about today.
I don't know if you're

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.750
recording yet but we can--yes,
okay, allez.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.738
So, just to put this in context
of the diplomatic origins of

00:01:55.738 --> 00:02:00.102
World War One,
because the traditional image

00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:06.129
of all this isn't a bad one.
It's the entangling alliances

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:11.688
that create this kind of house
of cards that when war first

00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:15.111
breaks out,
or for that matter when the

00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:19.120
Russian Empire declares
mobilization of its armies,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.657
that the house of cards will
collapse and the great powers,

00:02:23.657 --> 00:02:28.430
minus Italy which will wait for
the highest bidder in 1915,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
go to war.
So, how does this all happen;

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.940
briefly, in forty-five minutes,
how does this happen?

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.473
And towards the end of the
hour, towards the end of the

00:02:43.473 --> 00:02:46.678
forty-five minutes I'll talk a
little bit about one specific

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:49.775
affair that kind of demonstrates
the intensity of what had

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:52.837
happened,
and the shift away from England

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:56.680
being perceived as arguably
France's greatest enemy,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.168
despite Alsace-Lorraine,
to that of Germany,

00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:04.382
and that's the Saverne Affair,
Saverne, s-a-v-e-r-n-e or,

00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:08.520
in German, Zabern,
z-a-b-e-r-n.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.277
But, of course lots of the
diplomatic history of this

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:18.766
period at first revolves around
the enmity between France and

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:24.117
Germany and specifically,
as you've heard over and over

00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:28.549
again, Alsace-Lorraine.
And one can debate,

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.294
as historians have,
to what extent revenge

00:03:33.294 --> 00:03:38.039
permeated the ranks of French
society,

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.678
thoughts of taking back
Alsace-Lorraine through the

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.961
whole period.
And, as I said a few minutes

00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:46.210
ago, if you'd asked people in
the 1890s who France would go to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.495
war against,
if they had polls in those

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:51.808
days, most people would've said
Britain--more about that in

00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:54.208
awhile.
But it was always there,

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:58.628
it was always there for Otto
von Bismarck as he's trying to

00:03:58.628 --> 00:04:03.124
assure that if Germany does go
to war it won't have to fight

00:04:03.124 --> 00:04:07.650
his worst nightmare,
that is a war on two fronts;

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.198
and that's exactly what happens
when the French and the Russians

00:04:13.198 --> 00:04:17.572
get together.
And, so, that's a major issue

00:04:17.572 --> 00:04:23.994
in Western Europe--is obviously
the relationship between these

00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:28.584
folks and Alsace,
and the parts of Lorraine that

00:04:28.584 --> 00:04:31.980
had been annexed into the German
Empire;

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.769
annexed rather uncomfortably,
as we'll see in awhile.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:38.960
And the other--I just have to
dodge these peripherally,

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.822
but it's important to at least,
and I'm sure you know about

00:04:42.822 --> 00:04:47.213
them anyway--but the other thing
that it's going to hinge on is

00:04:47.213 --> 00:04:51.180
really the hatred between Russia
and Austria-Hungary,

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.981
and the fact that the Russians
see themselves as the protector

00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:59.174
of the Slavic peoples,
in the Balkans,

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:03.437
and the fact that the
Austro-Hungarian Empire is a

00:05:03.437 --> 00:05:06.553
polyglot empire,
that is you've got at least,

00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:09.482
depending how you count them,
fifteen major nationalities

00:05:09.482 --> 00:05:13.728
within the Empire,
and that although German is the

00:05:13.728 --> 00:05:18.300
language of the Empire that
Austria-Hungary,

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.729
these ethnic minorities and
their claims for national

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.243
independence exist as a
perpetual destabilizing factor

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:31.869
in Austria-Hungarian politics,
particularly when Russia,

00:05:31.869 --> 00:05:35.744
which has always dreamt of
Constantinople and controlling

00:05:35.744 --> 00:05:40.412
the access to the Black Sea,
is fanning the flames of

00:05:40.412 --> 00:05:46.507
nationalism, of pan-Slavism,
but also of nationalism within

00:05:46.507 --> 00:05:50.659
these various states,
which destabilizes,

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.259
potentially,
the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.810
And the Austro-Hungarian Empire
became the dual monarchy,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.410
before this course starts,
but in 1867.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.722
It's run out of Vienna,
which is that city which is

00:06:03.722 --> 00:06:07.697
left by the Treaty of Versailles
and the other treaties after

00:06:07.697 --> 00:06:11.892
World War One,
is this enormous capital of a

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:16.240
tiny country,
when the Empire disappears.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.774
But that is rushing the story,
rushing to the end of the

00:06:23.774 --> 00:06:28.668
story.
But by 1900 Russia is fanning

00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:36.788
the flames of pan-Slav fervor in
the mountainous territories of

00:06:36.788 --> 00:06:40.690
Bosnia-Herzegovina,
which include,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.385
as you know,
from the tragedies of the

00:06:43.385 --> 00:06:47.935
ethnic cleansing of the 1990s,
Serbs, Muslims,

00:06:47.935 --> 00:06:53.164
and Catholic Croats.
Now, the alliance system of the

00:06:53.164 --> 00:06:57.040
late nineteenth century,
which in its own way helps--is

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.060
one of the causes of World War
One--there are others,

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.218
too, that I'll discuss in
awhile--but it hinges on German

00:07:05.218 --> 00:07:09.629
and French antagonism,
and it hinges on the competing

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:14.449
interests of Austro-Hungary and
Russia in the Balkans,

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.287
and--here I'm
summarizing--Germany's fear of

00:07:18.287 --> 00:07:23.819
being attacked from both east
and west by Russia and France.

00:07:23.819 --> 00:07:27.635
So, at the beginning you've
got--those are three--there are

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:30.142
five big powers,
and Bismarck once said,

00:07:30.142 --> 00:07:32.787
and uses a French phrase,
which is interesting,

00:07:32.787 --> 00:07:35.949
because French was always the
language of diplomacy,

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.868
he says the most important
thing is to be "à

00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:40.431
trios," to be three.
If there are five you want to

00:07:40.431 --> 00:07:43.800
be three.
But what you have basically is

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:49.139
two potential free agents,
free agents with a big appetite

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:53.601
but very bad teeth,
as some wag once put it--Italy,

00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:57.630
here, which would go to the
highest bidder in 1915,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.750
and Great Britain.
Now, Great Britain,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.638
it's not a natural given that
Great Britain was going to ally

00:08:04.638 --> 00:08:08.668
with France,
its great enemy for centuries,

00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:13.866
or ally with Russia,
because Britain and Russia have

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:18.759
been fighting for a very long
time what some,

00:08:18.759 --> 00:08:22.462
another wag once called the
Great Game, which is for control

00:08:22.462 --> 00:08:26.102
along places we hear much about
these days such as Northern

00:08:26.102 --> 00:08:29.153
India,
Pakistan, all the way along

00:08:29.153 --> 00:08:33.107
into South Asia.
So, they are rivals for

00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:38.702
influence in all sorts of
different parts of this huge

00:08:38.702 --> 00:08:42.924
mass of Asia,
in the largest sense of the

00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:45.395
word.
So, one thing you have to ask,

00:08:45.395 --> 00:08:48.179
if you're just thinking about
it from the point of France,

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:52.463
is how does it happen that in
1914 that France finds itself

00:08:52.463 --> 00:08:56.821
allied with Great Britain and
with Great Britain's sometimes

00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:59.360
enemy,
that is Russia.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.673
And also from the point of
view, if you were a French

00:09:01.673 --> 00:09:04.343
Republican or you were a French
socialist who's a believer in

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:06.951
the Republic,
and most of them were,

00:09:06.951 --> 00:09:11.580
how do you explain how a
Republican state is allied with

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.002
the czar,
a czarist regime,

00:09:14.002 --> 00:09:17.659
an autocracy,
repressor of all of the peoples

00:09:17.659 --> 00:09:20.899
and among other things
orchestrator,

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:26.276
encourager, facilitator,
enabler of vicious pogroms

00:09:26.276 --> 00:09:30.942
against the Jews?
So, how this happens is

00:09:30.942 --> 00:09:37.553
extremely interesting and it
means that these powers are on

00:09:37.553 --> 00:09:44.394
the search for allies who are
going to give them an advantage

00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:49.575
should Europe go to war.
Now, later on I will make the

00:09:49.575 --> 00:09:53.519
case, and it's an obvious one to
make, is that most people who

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.269
followed such things expected a
war in their lifetimes.

00:09:57.269 --> 00:10:02.912
There had not been a major,
major conflagration since

00:10:02.912 --> 00:10:06.219
Waterloo, basically.
You had wars,

00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:10.675
you had fighting after the 1848
revolutions, the intervention of

00:10:10.675 --> 00:10:13.794
the Russian army,
you have the Crimean War,

00:10:13.794 --> 00:10:17.000
off in Crimea appropriately
enough, 1853,1856.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.269
You have Prussia fighting
Austria in 1866.

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:24.520
You have the Franco-Prussian
war, as you know,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.106
in 1870/71.
But basically this period is

00:10:27.106 --> 00:10:30.282
sometimes referred to in
textbooks-- I don't know if in

00:10:30.282 --> 00:10:33.694
mine it is or not--but as the
Pax Britannica because

00:10:33.694 --> 00:10:36.610
England rules the waves,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.948
But most people thought there
would be a war in their

00:10:39.948 --> 00:10:42.580
lifetime, because of these
antagonisms.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.606
More than that,
many people,

00:10:44.606 --> 00:10:49.109
how many it's difficult to say,
wanted a war--more about that

00:10:49.109 --> 00:10:52.102
later.
They expected a war but nobody

00:10:52.102 --> 00:10:56.662
expected a war that would carry
away four empires and millions

00:10:56.662 --> 00:10:59.417
of lives,
and would last way over four

00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:01.872
years, and would,
as I've said before,

00:11:01.872 --> 00:11:04.990
unleash the demons of the
twentieth century.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:11.771
So, in 1879 Bismarck forges the
cornerstone alliance between

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:17.891
Germany and Austria-Hungary.
And it's predicated on German

00:11:17.891 --> 00:11:21.759
support for Austria,
Hungary, and Hungarian

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:27.010
resistance against Russia's
activities in the Balkans.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:34.159
And, so, that's a key alliance.
And one of the continuities of

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.896
this entire period,
from 1879 to 1914,

00:11:36.896 --> 00:11:39.782
is this alliance,
which will become more

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:44.845
formalized later.
And this explains why it was in

00:11:44.845 --> 00:11:50.830
July of 1914 the Germans give
the famous blank check,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:53.972
and that's a good way of
putting it, a blank check to

00:11:53.972 --> 00:11:57.235
Austria-Hungary after the
assassination of the Archduke

00:11:57.235 --> 00:12:02.269
Francis-Ferdinand in Sarajevo,
on the 28th of June, 1914.

00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:05.124
And they say,
"you can do whatever you want

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:08.250
to Serbia and we will back you
all the way";

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:11.447
and back you all the way,
that's a big statement because

00:12:11.447 --> 00:12:15.110
that means we will back you even
if it involves eventually going

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.597
to war with these guys,
with the Russian army,

00:12:18.597 --> 00:12:22.520
the Russian masses,
the Russian nationality.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:25.684
And nobody really knew;
the Russian army had been

00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:29.884
defeated, and navy as well,
humiliated by the Japanese in

00:12:29.884 --> 00:12:33.110
the Russo-Japanese War of 1904
and 1905.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.337
So, nobody really knows what
this is going to be like but

00:12:36.337 --> 00:12:40.025
they all know it's going to take
two weeks for Russia to mobilize

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:42.038
its armies.
How do you get all these people

00:12:42.038 --> 00:12:44.826
from here to there?
You got one railroad line

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:48.345
running--which would cost them
in 1904/1905,

00:12:48.345 --> 00:12:53.009
running to Vladivostok,
the port on the Pacific Ocean;

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:56.110
or I don't know if it's on the
Yellow Sea or the Pacific Ocean,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.560
but it's way,
way far away.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.345
I've never been to Vladivostok.
But anyway this is the key,

00:13:01.345 --> 00:13:04.199
the first chip,
or the first part,

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:08.870
or the first block of this
alliance, and it's 1879.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:14.667
Now, a year later Italy allies
itself also with Austro-Hungary

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:19.799
and with Germany but there are
all sorts of what-if,

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:23.190
what-if, but-if,
but-ifs attached to that

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:27.090
alliance and Italy basically is
a freelance,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:34.450
a loose cannon,
during the entire period.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.490
Now, the last thing that
Bismarck wants--and remember

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.567
Bismarck's out of there;
you may not know this,

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:44.019
but he's out of there in about
1894, isn't that--?

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:46.420
He dies, I think in 1894,
if I remember right.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.407
So, he's not around.
But his nightmare is Germany

00:13:50.407 --> 00:13:53.916
being encircled.
And the last thing that he

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:58.416
wanted to see happen in his
lifetime or in the lifetimes of

00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:02.372
his somewhat hapless
successors--at the very end the

00:14:02.372 --> 00:14:06.483
man with so much authority over
foreign policy is this

00:14:06.483 --> 00:14:09.492
lugubrious,
sad man called Bethmann

00:14:09.492 --> 00:14:13.417
Hollweg, whose name you can
forget, who was convinced--he

00:14:13.417 --> 00:14:16.605
once tells his son,
"don't plant a lot of trees on

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.951
our estates because the Russians
eventually will come and take

00:14:19.951 --> 00:14:22.419
these estates and they won't do
any good."

00:14:22.419 --> 00:14:26.034
And he had this sort of
fatalism that he was convinced

00:14:26.034 --> 00:14:28.490
that there would have to be a
war,

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.621
and he once says that
necessity--a chilling phrase

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:35.319
that is echoed in our own time,
indeed in own country

00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:38.120
sometimes--"necessity knows no
law."

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.890
But, anyway,
all of the successors of

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.585
Bismarck, the last thing they
want to do is to see France ally

00:14:45.585 --> 00:14:49.950
with these guys here.
Now how does that happen?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:54.014
If you go to Paris and you go
to one of the more beautiful

00:14:54.014 --> 00:14:57.034
bridges in Paris,
from the end of the nineteenth

00:14:57.034 --> 00:15:00.251
century, is the Pont Alexandre
III, the Bridge of Alexander

00:15:00.251 --> 00:15:02.010
III,
which is sort of beautiful;

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.465
it has art nouveau touches.
And here was this odd scene of

00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:09.595
the czar, repressor of all the
peoples, showing up and having

00:15:09.595 --> 00:15:13.726
to teach the French Marine Band
how to play the theme song of

00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:15.650
the Czar,
whatever that is,

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:18.870
and the Russian Military Band
learning the Marseillaise;

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.706
how incongruous since the last
thing that the Russian Czar

00:15:21.706 --> 00:15:24.691
would ever contemplate was the
kind of government that France

00:15:24.691 --> 00:15:26.650
has.
How does that happen?

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.527
That is really extraordinary.
Well, it has to do with fear of

00:15:30.527 --> 00:15:34.622
Germany, but there are other
things that I should mention

00:15:34.622 --> 00:15:38.937
just briefly that drive these
two improbable powers together

00:15:38.937 --> 00:15:41.789
and-- besides the cultural
factor,

00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:44.338
because lots of people,
lots of the Russian elite,

00:15:44.338 --> 00:15:46.940
some spoke German,
depending on where they live.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.899
In Konigsburg and places like
that they spoke German.

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:52.471
But lots of them spoke French
and you had these sort of

00:15:52.471 --> 00:15:55.073
cultural ties.
My mother, who grew up in

00:15:55.073 --> 00:15:57.359
Battle Creek,
Michigan, of all places,

00:15:57.359 --> 00:16:00.181
Kellogg's of Battle Creek,
she was taught French,

00:16:00.181 --> 00:16:02.525
though not very well,
by a Russian--a member of the

00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:05.385
Russian Royal Family who--all
these people when they--and they

00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:08.223
have to go after the Russian,
the Bolshevik Revolution,

00:16:08.223 --> 00:16:11.008
they come to the United States
and lots of them (I have a

00:16:11.008 --> 00:16:13.693
student working on this
now)--and of being taxi drivers

00:16:13.693 --> 00:16:16.045
in Paris,
and some of them come to the

00:16:16.045 --> 00:16:18.646
United States,
and the more well-heeled ones,

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:21.070
some are getting jobs teaching
French.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.675
But that enough is the old
cultural connection,

00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:26.903
it isn't all that important,
and that's not going to drive

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:30.452
them together at all.
But there are other forces

00:16:30.452 --> 00:16:33.979
besides after 1879 a potential
common enemy,

00:16:33.979 --> 00:16:37.900
particularly this one.
And one of them is economic

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.263
investment, is that one of those
things I mentioned before about

00:16:42.263 --> 00:16:46.142
French investors is that those
with capital to invest are

00:16:46.142 --> 00:16:49.190
frequently investing outside of
France,

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.419
and they invest heavily in
Russia.

00:16:52.419 --> 00:16:57.118
There is still some suit
somewhere in which some French

00:16:57.118 --> 00:17:02.250
company is trying to get from
the Russia of Putin money back

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.990
lost in 1917.
It is still going on.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.884
And, so, lots of money was
invested in Russia,

00:17:08.884 --> 00:17:12.000
particularly in Russian
railroads;

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.264
they invest in Spanish
railroads, and in Italian

00:17:14.264 --> 00:17:16.240
railroads, and in other things
as well.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.859
But there is this conduit;
and money has a big influence

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.752
in diplomatic matters,
and if you're trying to explain

00:17:25.752 --> 00:17:28.690
why it is that the French
ambassador,

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.530
a totally forgettable guy
called Maurice

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:35.099
Paléologue,
is chasing around in the garden

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:40.203
representatives of the czar,
trying to firm up the details

00:17:40.203 --> 00:17:44.028
that Russia will,
if France is invaded by

00:17:44.028 --> 00:17:47.384
Germany,
move its armies in this

00:17:47.384 --> 00:17:52.895
direction and attack Russia--you
have to go back to that

00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:58.952
fundamental fact;
it is that these economic ties

00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:06.788
help solidify the sort of great
power arrangements that are

00:18:06.788 --> 00:18:10.058
being made.
And, so, in 1889,

00:18:10.058 --> 00:18:14.114
the year of the centenary of
the French Revolution,

00:18:14.114 --> 00:18:18.575
here is the Czar of Russia
showing up in Paris and being

00:18:18.575 --> 00:18:23.560
welcomed enthusiastically.
And of course the socialists

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.413
don't like it all because
of--and this wasn't even--this

00:18:28.413 --> 00:18:31.589
was before the pogrom in 1905
in,

00:18:31.589 --> 00:18:36.119
particularly in Crimea but in
other places as well.

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:40.819
And, so, in 1892 France and
Russia sign a military treaty by

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:45.119
which each pledge a military
response if the other were

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:49.579
attacked by Germany or by one or
more of its allies.

00:18:49.579 --> 00:18:53.589
And there's a formal alliance
in 1894.

00:18:53.589 --> 00:18:57.204
Now, formal alliances are not
published in Figaro or in

00:18:57.204 --> 00:18:59.160
Le Temps,
in newspapers;

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.755
but, everybody knows the rough
outlines of this,

00:19:01.755 --> 00:19:05.425
everybody knows.
Nobody has any illusions,

00:19:05.425 --> 00:19:10.347
in London, in Vienna,
in Berlin about what this

00:19:10.347 --> 00:19:15.406
treaty means.
And what this does is it ends

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:21.637
what Bismarck had intended,
the diplomatic isolation of

00:19:21.637 --> 00:19:26.829
France, and now these guys are
surrounded.

00:19:26.829 --> 00:19:30.109
Now, how did Britain get into
this?

00:19:30.109 --> 00:19:35.642
Briefly, well Britain gets into
this in the following way,

00:19:35.642 --> 00:19:41.271
that Germany basically becomes
a much bigger economic rival

00:19:41.271 --> 00:19:45.073
than anyone else,
that the German economy,

00:19:45.073 --> 00:19:48.599
particularly industrial
economy, grows rapidly.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:52.948
They, virtually they're nipping
at the British heels in terms of

00:19:52.948 --> 00:19:55.825
steel production,
they're cranking out huge

00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:59.269
battleships, which are called
dreadnought battleships,

00:19:59.269 --> 00:20:02.846
or that's just the size of the
ship, and its advantage in the

00:20:02.846 --> 00:20:06.483
military thing is to have the
latest guns and the latest ships

00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:10.670
as opposed to ones made older,
and that sort of thing.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.213
So, they're nipping at their
heels and in some aspects even

00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:17.107
in steel production increasing.
And they go way ahead in

00:20:17.107 --> 00:20:20.188
chemistry;
the Germans are without any

00:20:20.188 --> 00:20:24.612
question the leading power in
chemical production and chemical

00:20:24.612 --> 00:20:28.023
experimentation,
and the universities play a

00:20:28.023 --> 00:20:32.722
major role in that.
So, and that with this economic

00:20:32.722 --> 00:20:38.180
rivalry is--which has things,
is involved in Africa,

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.959
imperial rivalry there,
et cetera, et cetera--goes the

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:48.369
naval rivalry that heats up
after the turn of the century.

00:20:48.369 --> 00:20:52.695
And in both Germany and in
Britain, as in France,

00:20:52.695 --> 00:20:57.276
you've got these naval leagues,
you've got these groups of

00:20:57.276 --> 00:21:00.921
citizens who invite admirals to
dinner, they give thundering

00:21:00.921 --> 00:21:04.505
speeches about defeating the
perfidious Albion or defeating

00:21:04.505 --> 00:21:07.376
whomever,
they all-- but what they really

00:21:07.376 --> 00:21:10.807
want to do is to get their
countries to build more big

00:21:10.807 --> 00:21:12.071
ships;
and, of course,

00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:15.776
industrialists just love that.
And the stuff that Charles was

00:21:15.776 --> 00:21:20.140
talking about the other day,
bring an explorer to lunch,

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.366
and then have him talk about
how awful the horrible Huns are,

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.595
that is the Germans,
the borschts and

00:21:25.595 --> 00:21:28.429
all that, in the French case.
And it all--and so they have

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:32.390
this big, big rivalry going on
because Britain's control of the

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.009
seas has basically been for
centuries.

00:21:35.009 --> 00:21:37.738
In World War One there was only
one naval battle of any

00:21:37.738 --> 00:21:39.859
consequence, which was basically
a draw,

00:21:39.859 --> 00:21:44.879
but in which the British navy
forces the Germans back--this is

00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:49.570
in the next war--will force the
Germans back into port,

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:52.390
a battle up here.
So, the last thing they do,

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:55.347
that the British think that
they can do is lose control of

00:21:55.347 --> 00:21:58.206
the seas,
and all these big German ships

00:21:58.206 --> 00:22:02.380
in kind of an aggressive way,
that they're inaugurated by

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:07.116
this--Nicholas or by the Kaiser,
Wilhelm II banging bottles of

00:22:07.116 --> 00:22:11.223
German champagne over these
ships, and giving more heated

00:22:11.223 --> 00:22:15.550
speeches about Germany's destiny
and place in the world,

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.684
et cetera, et cetera.
And, so, what happens is that

00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:21.452
basically the British
government, which has for a long

00:22:21.452 --> 00:22:22.379
time,
has said, "well,

00:22:22.379 --> 00:22:23.747
we're not going to,
we don't need to make an

00:22:23.747 --> 00:22:27.365
alliance with anyone else,
with anyone at all," now as

00:22:27.365 --> 00:22:33.057
tension, economic tension,
followed by political and naval

00:22:33.057 --> 00:22:37.849
tension between Germany and
Britain increase,

00:22:37.849 --> 00:22:43.599
they begin looking across the
channel to zee French.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:48.363
And, I said earlier,
that in the 1890s--and the

00:22:48.363 --> 00:22:52.280
Fashoda incident is in what?
1898 or '99,

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.387
I can't remember,
it doesn't matter--if you ask

00:22:55.387 --> 00:22:58.359
people in Paris or Lyon or some
big city,

00:22:58.359 --> 00:23:00.216
or Bordeaux,
where the next war was going to

00:23:00.216 --> 00:23:02.160
be they would say it's against
the British.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.210
Well, let me give you an
example of that.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.319
There were--and since lots of
people expected wars,

00:23:07.319 --> 00:23:10.430
there are these folks writing
future war novels,

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:14.115
and it's just Jules Verne and
all of that, and there were

00:23:14.115 --> 00:23:17.603
these sort of science inspired
novels and writing that

00:23:17.603 --> 00:23:21.750
reflected electricity and sort
of space wars kind of stuff,

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.519
but there were also future war
novels.

00:23:23.519 --> 00:23:27.329
And one of the more ridiculous
ones, the author of which

00:23:27.329 --> 00:23:31.070
escapes me, was a novel
published that had some success

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:34.463
in England in the 1890s,
and it involves a future war

00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:36.398
against whom?
Not the Germans but against the

00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:38.125
French.
And the novel goes something

00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:41.157
like this--one would never want
to read such a thing--is that

00:23:41.157 --> 00:23:44.175
the people in Dover,
down here, the white cliffs of

00:23:44.175 --> 00:23:47.329
Dover, one day they wake up on
Sunday morning and,

00:23:47.329 --> 00:23:51.280
"my God, the French have
arrived," and in their sneaky

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.155
ways they had been digging a
tunnel under the English

00:23:55.155 --> 00:23:57.440
Channel.
Now, Napoleon wanted to dig a

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.069
tunnel under the English
Channel.

00:23:59.069 --> 00:24:01.299
We now have a tunnel under the
English Channel.

00:24:01.299 --> 00:24:05.099
I was in there again about five
weeks ago or six weeks ago,

00:24:05.099 --> 00:24:07.130
very rapidly,
the fast train,

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.768
that finally after all these
years the British finally did

00:24:09.768 --> 00:24:12.499
their part and now the train
actually runs fairly fast after

00:24:12.499 --> 00:24:14.666
it arrives at Dover,
instead of just sort of

00:24:14.666 --> 00:24:17.009
slinking along in the mud until
it gets to London.

00:24:17.009 --> 00:24:19.918
But, so these folks go out to
have their greasy eggs,

00:24:19.918 --> 00:24:23.273
and chips, and all this kind of
stuff on a Sunday morning and

00:24:23.273 --> 00:24:26.070
they suddenly see zee
French are there,

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:29.124
and they are armed.
And they have been--they have

00:24:29.124 --> 00:24:33.109
snuck through this tunnel that's
been being built underneath,

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:36.335
in their sneaky ways,
and then they pop up with their

00:24:36.335 --> 00:24:38.074
guns.
And the thing that's so

00:24:38.074 --> 00:24:41.362
ludicrous, talk about national
stereotypes, is that in this

00:24:41.362 --> 00:24:44.225
novel the soldiers,
at least the avant-garde,

00:24:44.225 --> 00:24:47.778
the first people arriving,
are dressed as French waiters

00:24:47.778 --> 00:24:50.750
and under their large dirty
napkins--again,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.299
this is the British image of
the French, those large--are

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:58.230
sneaky weapons that they have
been building and then hiding.

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.134
And, of course,
they rush out,

00:25:00.134 --> 00:25:03.023
they seize Dover,
and then the British people

00:25:03.023 --> 00:25:05.140
rally,
and of course they call out the

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.060
constables and they drive them
back into the tunnel and plug up

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.849
the tunnel,
and that's the end of that.

00:25:09.849 --> 00:25:12.755
But of course it's a call for
more military preparation,

00:25:12.755 --> 00:25:15.344
et cetera.
There's another similar novel

00:25:15.344 --> 00:25:19.119
written in about 1904 or 1905
and it's simply--it doesn't

00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:22.648
involve people in Dover,
it involves people up in Whitby

00:25:22.648 --> 00:25:24.908
and Scarborough in the
northeastern coast,

00:25:24.908 --> 00:25:27.663
where the wind is always
horizontal and the rain is

00:25:27.663 --> 00:25:30.640
pounding on you from every
conceivable direction.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.706
And they wake up and what they
see are these huge dreadnought

00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:35.700
battleships, lobbing enormous
shells,

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.117
and destroying British homes
and British people with big

00:25:40.117 --> 00:25:42.160
guns.
And the point of the novel,

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.342
outside of putting people to
sleep, was to get to encourage

00:25:45.342 --> 00:25:48.029
yet more military preparations
to fight a war,

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:52.960
not against the French anymore,
but against the Germans.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.854
And events in 1905,
the first Moroccan crisis,

00:25:55.854 --> 00:25:59.200
which you can read about in
Chip Sowerwine's book,

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.000
followed inevitably in 1911 by
the second Moroccan crisis.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.781
What this has to do with is
German saber rattling in

00:26:08.781 --> 00:26:11.875
Morocco, in Tangiers
specifically,

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:16.563
in the second case,
and in which the Kaiser himself

00:26:16.563 --> 00:26:19.952
shows up.
And what this does is it

00:26:19.952 --> 00:26:24.991
convinces the British that maybe
allying with the French isn't

00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:29.364
such a dumb idea after all.
And, so, they begin to have

00:26:29.364 --> 00:26:33.295
informal military talks that
become formal military talks

00:26:33.295 --> 00:26:36.285
that become an entente,
same word in English,

00:26:36.285 --> 00:26:38.895
an understanding,
that's a formal understanding,

00:26:38.895 --> 00:26:42.004
where they're sitting down and
saying the obvious things:

00:26:42.004 --> 00:26:43.449
"you,
the British Navy,

00:26:43.449 --> 00:26:46.640
will take care of the English
Channel, you'll take care of the

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.266
North Sea;
we, the French Navy,

00:26:49.266 --> 00:26:54.228
in Toulon, down here,
we will be responsible for the

00:26:54.228 --> 00:26:58.993
defense of the Mediterranean."
And this is of course

00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:02.026
more--this is,
because of the influence of

00:27:02.026 --> 00:27:04.896
Germany in Turkey,
and Turkey will finally come

00:27:04.896 --> 00:27:07.200
in, as you know,
in the war, on the German side;

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.484
thus Gallipoli where the
British officers send all the

00:27:10.484 --> 00:27:14.140
Australians and New Zealanders
to die this certain death,

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.349
up a hill that couldn't
possibly be conquered.

00:27:16.349 --> 00:27:20.130
They sent British soldiers too,
they sent everybody.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.092
But, anyway,
so it's more--there was a

00:27:22.092 --> 00:27:24.692
reason, also because
Austro-Hungry then did have a

00:27:24.692 --> 00:27:27.840
port.
So, this is no mere gesture

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.943
toward the French.
But this explains how it was

00:27:31.943 --> 00:27:36.549
that these two also fairly
unlikely powers come together.

00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:40.244
Moreover, remember what I've
come back to two or three times,

00:27:40.244 --> 00:27:44.016
the birthrate.
The French realized that if the

00:27:44.016 --> 00:27:48.240
war, if it's more than just a
short encounter,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:52.351
and Lord knows it would become
that--more about this during

00:27:52.351 --> 00:27:56.180
World War One--that their
birthrate is so miniscule,

00:27:56.180 --> 00:28:00.380
compared to the rest of Europe,
that you better have allies;

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.357
if you're going to be fighting
the Germans you better have

00:28:02.357 --> 00:28:03.762
allies.
And everybody knew what the

00:28:03.762 --> 00:28:05.619
birthrates were.
Here are just some examples.

00:28:05.619 --> 00:28:11.383
This is live births per 1,000
inhabitants, 1908,1913,

00:28:11.383 --> 00:28:14.930
so a key period:
France, 19.5;

00:28:14.930 --> 00:28:25.290
England, 24.9;
Germany, 29.5;

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:34.140
European Russia, 45.6;
and Italy, 32.4.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:38.650
So, military planners know this
stuff, they know that exactly.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.105
And that means it's all that
more important for the French,

00:28:42.105 --> 00:28:44.250
if they're contemplating this
war,

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:49.980
to take that space back to
count on all of these people.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.413
But it will take these people,
as I said, two weeks to

00:28:54.413 --> 00:28:58.680
mobilize, and that's why the act
of mobilization,

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:03.779
the decree of the Czar,
is tantamount to an act of war.

00:29:03.779 --> 00:29:08.056
Because what this does is--this
is leaping ahead and I'll come

00:29:08.056 --> 00:29:12.193
back to it, but it's important
enough that it's worth coming

00:29:12.193 --> 00:29:16.540
back to--this tells the Germans
they have two weeks in order to

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.887
defeat France--they're sure they
can do it--and then you better

00:29:20.887 --> 00:29:25.023
stop because this big bear is
going to have mobilized all of

00:29:25.023 --> 00:29:28.880
these people in Central Asia and
other parts,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:32.019
and they're going to be
lumbering towards you.

00:29:32.019 --> 00:29:36.560
So, you better stop them,
in two weeks.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.700
How are you going to do that?
The French have big forts,

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.989
all along here,
here and there and everywhere,

00:29:43.989 --> 00:29:47.643
the way--and you know they're
going to want to move

00:29:47.643 --> 00:29:51.151
immediately into
Alsace-Lorraine--more about this

00:29:51.151 --> 00:29:54.265
again later.
So, the way to do it,

00:29:54.265 --> 00:29:58.621
and not for the last time,
they are willing to violate

00:29:58.621 --> 00:30:01.843
Belgian neutrality,
and Dutch neutrality,

00:30:01.843 --> 00:30:04.400
though that disappears from the
plan.

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.077
The Schlieffen Plan,
which I'll come back to,

00:30:07.077 --> 00:30:09.876
written in 1905,
is predicated on the fact that

00:30:09.876 --> 00:30:12.980
the French are going to invade
Alsace-Lorraine,

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.765
and so you'll just sweep into a
neutral country,

00:30:17.765 --> 00:30:22.329
Belgium, neutral since 1831.
Now, what does that do?

00:30:22.329 --> 00:30:27.413
That guarantees that without
any question at all,

00:30:27.413 --> 00:30:32.180
guarantees that the British
will go to war.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.952
Why?
For the British it seemed bad

00:30:35.952 --> 00:30:39.682
enough to have the French across
the channel, but what if you

00:30:39.682 --> 00:30:44.029
have the Germans in Belgium,
in Austen, which is a short hop

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:47.854
across the channel,
and really is the shortest way

00:30:47.854 --> 00:30:51.680
or one of the two shortest ways
to get across.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.861
So, that's impossible,
you can't have that,

00:30:54.861 --> 00:30:59.121
so you're going to go to war.
Now, was that a risk--why was

00:30:59.121 --> 00:31:02.220
that a risk that Germans were
willing to take?

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.674
Because the English,
the British do not have a

00:31:05.674 --> 00:31:08.490
conscript army.
They have a tiny army,

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:12.610
it's called an expeditionary
force, and will take them a long

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.305
time,
months and maybe longer,

00:31:15.305 --> 00:31:20.846
to raise the kind of army that
could make any difference in the

00:31:20.846 --> 00:31:24.599
long run here in France and in
Belgium.

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:27.709
So, these cards,
this house of cards is there,

00:31:27.709 --> 00:31:30.680
these entangling lines are sort
of there.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:35.575
And, so, that's basically what
happens in 1914 is when--and I

00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:39.900
remember going to Sarajevo
before it was destroyed,

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.371
in the '90s,
and I remember putting my feet

00:31:42.371 --> 00:31:44.490
where the sixteen-year-old
gunner,

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.375
Princip, put his feet as
he--when Archduke

00:31:47.375 --> 00:31:51.598
Francis-Ferdinand-- the driver
had the bad idea of backing up

00:31:51.598 --> 00:31:55.352
after having missed a turn,
after they tried to kill him

00:31:55.352 --> 00:31:58.834
once, and then Princip suddenly
finds himself with the Archduke

00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:01.654
and his wife there,
and he blows them away,

00:32:01.654 --> 00:32:04.587
right there.
This leads to the blank check

00:32:04.587 --> 00:32:08.029
and it's going to-- and you can
read about this,

00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:13.463
you already know it from high
school history--it brings Europe

00:32:13.463 --> 00:32:17.961
into this dreadful war.
Now, some more things,

00:32:17.961 --> 00:32:19.820
some more things.

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:27.270
Let me just give you--do I have
time for that?

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:31.636
Yes.
Let me give you an example of

00:32:31.636 --> 00:32:36.430
how the stakes get--the tension
gets heated up.

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:40.155
Now, again, like revolutions,
wars don't necessarily break

00:32:40.155 --> 00:32:44.141
out according to the hydraulic
model where things are awful in

00:32:44.141 --> 00:32:46.470
1910;
in 1911 it's even more tense;

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.184
in 1912, "oh my God";
1913,1914, it's got to come--it

00:32:50.184 --> 00:32:54.319
doesn't work like that.
You have the Balkan Wars going

00:32:54.319 --> 00:32:58.029
on down in the Balkans,
appropriately enough,

00:32:58.029 --> 00:33:02.920
a couple of years before World
War One and all of that.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:06.252
But there are these moments,
like 1905 the first Moroccan

00:33:06.252 --> 00:33:08.930
affair, in 1911 the second
Moroccan affair,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.569
that raise the tensions between
these countries and make it

00:33:12.569 --> 00:33:16.490
possible for the popular press,
and sort of the culture of war

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.759
to target the "enemy," the enemy
for the future war.

00:33:19.759 --> 00:33:24.873
And in this incident,
Saverne, is at least

00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:30.736
interesting enough to--no,
in German, in French,

00:33:30.736 --> 00:33:38.220
to discuss because it leads to
this increase in tension.

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.808
And this is 1913.
Now, Alsace and parts of

00:33:42.808 --> 00:33:48.173
Lorraine are annexed in 1871.
But the German government

00:33:48.173 --> 00:33:52.600
doesn't really trust Alsatians;
in fact, they don't have the

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.589
same statute within the Empire
as the other parts of Germany,

00:33:55.589 --> 00:33:57.140
such as Bavaria,
or Vienenburg,

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.207
or Hanover, that they have,
or Pomerania,

00:33:59.207 --> 00:34:01.460
or Brandenburg,
or any of the other states.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.779
They are part of the empire but
they don't have all the rights.

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:10.243
As a matter of fact the
representatives in the Reichstag

00:34:10.243 --> 00:34:13.895
from Alsace and Lorraine cannot
vote on certain key foreign

00:34:13.895 --> 00:34:17.547
policy matters and all of that.
So, there's a lot of tension

00:34:17.547 --> 00:34:20.233
there.
But again, showing the sort of

00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:23.099
people can have multiple
identities.

00:34:23.099 --> 00:34:28.573
To be sure, many people left
Alsace and Lorraine and moved to

00:34:28.573 --> 00:34:32.364
Paris, and moved to Belfort,
and all sorts of--Nancy,

00:34:32.364 --> 00:34:34.956
and all sorts of places after
1871, because they didn't want

00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:38.905
to be German.
But Alsace is basically--and

00:34:38.905 --> 00:34:44.469
Lorraine is basically German
speaking, in 1913.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:49.857
The total, just to give you an
example, of the number of

00:34:49.857 --> 00:34:53.873
communes in--administrative
units in 1913:

00:34:53.873 --> 00:34:57.703
385 spoke French,
where French is the majority

00:34:57.703 --> 00:35:03.579
language in 385;
1,225 are German speaking;

00:35:03.579 --> 00:35:06.909
and eighty-six,
no one has a majority.

00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:09.982
So, in other words
seventy-seven percent of the

00:35:09.982 --> 00:35:14.056
communes in Alsace and the parts
of Lorraine that were annexed

00:35:14.056 --> 00:35:16.723
are German speaking.
Yet many people,

00:35:16.723 --> 00:35:20.114
not all but many people,
and we don't know how many,

00:35:20.114 --> 00:35:24.170
consider themselves French,
even though they spoke German.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.645
Well, why not?
There were lots of people who

00:35:26.645 --> 00:35:29.203
had multiple identities;
we've talked about--who were

00:35:29.203 --> 00:35:31.289
Basques who feel that they're
French, or Gascon,

00:35:31.289 --> 00:35:33.154
or Provençal,
or Flemish, et cetera,

00:35:33.154 --> 00:35:36.099
et cetera.
So, you've got this sort

00:35:36.099 --> 00:35:39.652
of--that situation.
Alsace is terribly important

00:35:39.652 --> 00:35:42.780
because when you go up to the
border between Alsace,

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.016
old French Alsace and German
Alsace, you've got this

00:35:46.016 --> 00:35:49.190
crêtes,
or these--what do you say?;

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:51.030
crêtes,
I can't even think what it is.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:55.494
In English you have these
mountains, these summits really,

00:35:55.494 --> 00:35:59.380
and you've got this road,
a military road all along the

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.190
top, and so it's an important
frontier point.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:04.771
And, so, for the point of view
of the German military,

00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:07.110
in particular,
they don't trust the Alsatians,

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:13.424
even though they speak German,
they speak the same German that

00:36:13.424 --> 00:36:18.290
is spoken across the Rhine River
in Freiberg,

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:22.506
for example.
And what this incident that

00:36:22.506 --> 00:36:27.225
takes place in 1913 does is it
confirms the image of German

00:36:27.225 --> 00:36:31.828
aggressiveness.
And there's a chance it

00:36:31.828 --> 00:36:35.780
could've brought war;
it doesn't.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:39.761
But here are other reasons,
too, why Berlin does not trust

00:36:39.761 --> 00:36:41.789
Alsatians.
Why?

00:36:41.789 --> 00:36:44.157
One reason is that remember
Bismarck was totally

00:36:44.157 --> 00:36:46.273
anti-Catholic,
and he wages this war on the

00:36:46.273 --> 00:36:48.489
Catholics called the
kulturkampf,

00:36:48.489 --> 00:36:51.849
or the cultural war against the
Catholics.

00:36:51.849 --> 00:36:54.982
And within the German Empire
you've got Catholics in the

00:36:54.982 --> 00:36:57.886
Rhineland, you've got Catholics
dominant in Bavaria,

00:36:57.886 --> 00:37:00.849
and you've got Catholics where?
In Alsace.

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:02.639
And this is part of the
problem, too.

00:37:02.639 --> 00:37:10.207
So, you've got these tensions
between German officers and

00:37:10.207 --> 00:37:14.389
Alsatian citizens.
And finally in 1911

00:37:14.389 --> 00:37:19.216
Alsace-Lorraine is recognized as
a federal state but they still

00:37:19.216 --> 00:37:22.019
have to abstain on issues of
war,

00:37:22.019 --> 00:37:24.219
treaties, and constitutional
amendments.

00:37:24.219 --> 00:37:26.560
So, you've got this little town
called Saverne,

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:28.698
which is a very pretty place,
8,000 people,

00:37:28.698 --> 00:37:30.530
with a canal running through
it.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.635
You've got your basic German
officers with their dueling

00:37:34.635 --> 00:37:39.039
scars and lots of tension
between civilians and soldiers.

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:42.600
And the tension was made worse
when a German officer,

00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.956
indeed speaking to some
Alsatian soldiers who were

00:37:45.956 --> 00:37:50.201
there--they tried to bring the
soldiers from other parts of the

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:55.018
Empire to be soldiers there,
the way that you would never

00:37:55.018 --> 00:37:59.105
find Castilian,
or you'd never find the Catalan

00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:03.348
soldiers guarding Barcelona,
you'd find Castilian

00:38:03.348 --> 00:38:07.590
soldiers--he refers to all
Alsatians in an extraordinarily

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.270
scatological and pejorative
term,

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.956
in German slang.
And people don't like that,

00:38:12.956 --> 00:38:15.019
there's a lot of tension,
and that word spreads.

00:38:15.019 --> 00:38:18.895
And then an officer says,
"I don't care if you kill these

00:38:18.895 --> 00:38:23.047
bastards, what a good thing that
would be," or something like

00:38:23.047 --> 00:38:25.280
that.
And, so, word spreads.

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.662
And it turned out there was a
junior officer who had had the

00:38:28.662 --> 00:38:31.986
very bad idea of sleeping with a
fourteen-year-old Alsatian

00:38:31.986 --> 00:38:33.852
woman,
and so some of the Alsatian

00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:36.627
guys get a little drunked up,
and then they pull him out of

00:38:36.627 --> 00:38:38.590
the room and beat the hell out
of him.

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:41.344
And, so, things get--it was
probably a good idea,

00:38:41.344 --> 00:38:43.410
but they shouldn't have done
that.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:47.304
But it goes from there;
going from there,

00:38:47.304 --> 00:38:51.066
and then the German High
Command and the newspapers get

00:38:51.066 --> 00:38:53.586
involved in this,
and they make it seem like

00:38:53.586 --> 00:38:56.013
there have been insults to the
German flag, to the German

00:38:56.013 --> 00:38:58.417
emperor,
by these people who cannot be

00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:01.739
trusted because they are who
they are, et cetera.

00:39:01.739 --> 00:39:03.960
And, of course,
the French say well these are

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:06.179
real French people who are being
attacked,

00:39:06.179 --> 00:39:09.102
and indeed molested,
in one case,

00:39:09.102 --> 00:39:13.030
child rape essentially,
at least legally,

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:17.976
by these horrible Huns.
And everything just--the

00:39:17.976 --> 00:39:21.647
tension level goes up.
Now, they don't go to war,

00:39:21.647 --> 00:39:24.110
but it confirms these kinds of
stereotypes that you would see

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:26.039
by the way in the first year of
the war too,

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:29.761
where the images of the brutal
German--and there were

00:39:29.761 --> 00:39:33.840
atrocities, there were
atrocities committed by Germans,

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.403
more than were committed by
other people on the western

00:39:36.403 --> 00:39:39.971
front, that's without question;
and all these rumors that kind

00:39:39.971 --> 00:39:43.440
of confirmed this image that is
in many ways false,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:46.267
but there was enough of a grain
of truth in it that it goes back

00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:48.664
to this incident.
So, this minor incident,

00:39:48.664 --> 00:39:51.688
what's essentially a shouting
match and a fight,

00:39:51.688 --> 00:39:54.969
in a small town in Alsace has
huge implications.

00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:59.017
And what it does is it helps
confirm not only the image of

00:39:59.017 --> 00:40:03.206
the Other, but it confirms these
military plans that for the

00:40:03.206 --> 00:40:06.401
French it's going to be very,
very important,

00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:08.161
for the home front
particularly,

00:40:08.161 --> 00:40:10.375
that you better,
when the war starts get

00:40:10.375 --> 00:40:12.590
yourself into Alsace and
Lorraine,

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:15.467
and take Alsace-Lorraine back.
Some of them think,

00:40:15.467 --> 00:40:17.835
"well, we can't really--they're
not going to really go through

00:40:17.835 --> 00:40:19.626
Belgium, are they?"
They think that maybe they're

00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:22.911
going to be fighting them here;
of course, that all will happen

00:40:22.911 --> 00:40:25.369
later.
But, so, in 1914 there really

00:40:25.369 --> 00:40:28.799
aren't any surprises,
the way it--and the people who

00:40:28.799 --> 00:40:31.490
tried to stop the war,
like Sir Edward Grey,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.897
who said "the lights are going
out all over Europe,

00:40:33.897 --> 00:40:36.159
they will not be lit again in
our lifetime."

00:40:36.159 --> 00:40:39.341
Man, did he ever have that
right, absolutely right,

00:40:39.341 --> 00:40:42.904
because the war--1914 to 1944
is basically one continuous

00:40:42.904 --> 00:40:45.848
poisonous war,
a new, terrible Thirty Years

00:40:45.848 --> 00:40:48.826
War.
But once this had all been set

00:40:48.826 --> 00:40:52.900
up there wasn't much could
happen to stop it,

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:55.618
and the way the war,
the way the military planning

00:40:55.618 --> 00:40:59.114
goes is it helps explain--and I
will explain next Monday--how it

00:40:59.114 --> 00:41:02.221
was that this war that was
supposed to be over before the

00:41:02.221 --> 00:41:04.362
leaves fall,
over before Christmas,

00:41:04.362 --> 00:41:06.699
home before Christmas,
et cetera, et cetera;

00:41:06.699 --> 00:41:09.831
not Berlin, not Paris,
à Berlin,

00:41:09.831 --> 00:41:13.590
goes on for years and years,
and carries away an entire

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.266
generation of people,
of young men,

00:41:16.266 --> 00:41:19.479
an entire generation.
It's built into the planning,

00:41:19.479 --> 00:41:21.390
and we will see how that
happens.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.732
It's a terribly important story.
And then certainly there is no

00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:28.825
event in the twentieth century
in which there was so much been

00:41:28.825 --> 00:41:31.710
written on this,
on how the war started.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.076
I remember my uncle,
my great-uncle,

00:41:34.076 --> 00:41:36.714
who fought for America,
he was American,

00:41:36.714 --> 00:41:39.690
and he fought in 1917,1918 and
all that.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.590
I remember, and I was a little
teeny guy when he died.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:45.888
But they gave me the book of
the documents showing that the

00:41:45.888 --> 00:41:48.680
Germans started it all.
But the Germans didn't start it

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.156
all, and that would have a huge
impact on what happens in

00:41:51.156 --> 00:41:53.809
Germany in the '20s and '30s,
and thus be very important.

00:41:53.809 --> 00:41:56.829
But that's why this is an
important subject.

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:59.179
And just in conclusion,
what else can we say?

00:41:59.179 --> 00:42:04.520
Obviously, it's not only these
diplomatic factors and not only

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.810
this military planning that
brings about this war,

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:13.502
there's more to it than that.
And Charles alluded very

00:42:13.502 --> 00:42:17.633
effectively, very cleverly,
to some of the other factors

00:42:17.633 --> 00:42:21.072
the other day,
and I barely need to repeat

00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:25.237
them, but that the imperial
rivalry helps create this

00:42:25.237 --> 00:42:30.203
culture of popular imperialism
which feeds into this culture of

00:42:30.203 --> 00:42:35.090
popular aggressive nationalism
that--in which the Other,

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:40.610
whether it be an indigenous
person who dares stand up for

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.559
his or her rights in Mali,
or somewhere like that;

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:49.540
the next stage is identifying
the Other, the dangerous Other,

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:54.430
as being one's enemy,
traditional enemy in some--in

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:59.570
the case of Germany and France,
on the continent.

00:42:59.570 --> 00:43:02.891
And we call this jingoism,
from kind of a poem that was in

00:43:02.891 --> 00:43:06.154
a British newspaper--I think
that's where it started--"by

00:43:06.154 --> 00:43:08.523
jingo we'll get them,"
et cetera, et cetera,

00:43:08.523 --> 00:43:11.368
"by jingo we get them."
And jingoism basically means

00:43:11.368 --> 00:43:16.156
aggressive nationalism.
And it's this expectation that

00:43:16.156 --> 00:43:19.554
war will come,
which not only the

00:43:19.554 --> 00:43:23.800
military--Joffre said,
one of the high command in

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.858
France, he said he
anticipated--every day he dreamt

00:43:26.858 --> 00:43:29.277
of the next war,
of what it would be like,

00:43:29.277 --> 00:43:31.239
that it would be wonderful,
thrilling.

00:43:31.239 --> 00:43:35.544
And the whole--and the Social
Darwinist idea that you got the

00:43:35.544 --> 00:43:39.073
survival of the fittest.
But if you're going to show

00:43:39.073 --> 00:43:42.152
you're the fittest,
what a better way to do it than

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:45.664
instead of just dueling with
some guy in your own national

00:43:45.664 --> 00:43:48.364
team,
getting a dueling scar on some

00:43:48.364 --> 00:43:52.186
general that you quarreled with
over a woman in a tavern

00:43:52.186 --> 00:43:55.005
sometime,
now you're going to show that

00:43:55.005 --> 00:43:58.360
you feel a nationality--the
British, the French,

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.052
the Germans,
the Russians,

00:44:00.052 --> 00:44:03.910
you name it--that you're the
best and you're going to show

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.183
them,
and you're going to show them

00:44:06.183 --> 00:44:08.602
on the battlefield.
And, so, the point of view of

00:44:08.602 --> 00:44:11.147
the French, what one has to keep
in mind is the French were

00:44:11.147 --> 00:44:12.517
invaded;
the French did not invade

00:44:12.517 --> 00:44:14.293
Germany, the Germans invaded
France, c'est tout,

00:44:14.293 --> 00:44:18.075
quoi.
But nonetheless there was this

00:44:18.075 --> 00:44:23.780
expectation of war and the way
it fits into these,

00:44:23.780 --> 00:44:26.504
the equivalent of Boys
Life magazines and popular

00:44:26.504 --> 00:44:29.940
novels about the future war,
painting the map of the world

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.640
the color of your particular
country, red in the case of

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.719
Britain,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:44:35.719 --> 00:44:39.524
All of this comes together and
it helps us try to explain this

00:44:39.524 --> 00:44:42.342
great enthusiasm,
at least in the big cities,

00:44:42.342 --> 00:44:45.606
at the Bonhoeffer in Berlin,
or at the Gare de l'est in

00:44:45.606 --> 00:44:47.619
Paris,
for this war.

00:44:47.619 --> 00:44:50.703
Now, whether people in other
parts of France and Germany and

00:44:50.703 --> 00:44:53.159
other places were enthusiastic
about the war,

00:44:53.159 --> 00:44:56.086
it's a very moot question
that's been hotly debated,

00:44:56.086 --> 00:44:59.530
and in many places obviously
they had better things to do.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.204
They had to get the harvest in,
which would be one problem on

00:45:02.204 --> 00:45:04.879
the home front and every place,
because the war starts in the

00:45:04.879 --> 00:45:08.250
summer.
But the expectation of war and

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:14.300
the culture of war closely tied
to the culture of nationalism,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.459
aggressive nationalism,
tied to imperialism and

00:45:16.459 --> 00:45:18.289
economic rivalry and everything
else,

00:45:18.289 --> 00:45:21.550
helps explain how this war came
about.

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.872
And the idea of how people
accepted the war is more

00:45:24.872 --> 00:45:28.261
complicated, and dependent on
where the armies were,

00:45:28.261 --> 00:45:31.118
and all of this.
And that's a remarkable story,

00:45:31.118 --> 00:45:34.073
and it's to that I'll turn in
the second lecture next week,

00:45:34.073 --> 00:45:36.404
the home front.
The first lecture next week

00:45:36.404 --> 00:45:39.336
will be how we ended up with
this trench warfare that has

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:42.059
been so dominant in the visual
images of the war,

00:45:42.059 --> 00:45:45.418
in the museums about the war,
and in that great literature

00:45:45.418 --> 00:45:48.069
about the war,
some of which you'll be reading

00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:52.000
when you read Barbusse.
Allez.

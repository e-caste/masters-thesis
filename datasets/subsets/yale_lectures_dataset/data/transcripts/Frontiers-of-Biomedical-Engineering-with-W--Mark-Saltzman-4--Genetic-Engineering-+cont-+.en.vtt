00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.571
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, we're going to continue

00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:17.832
talking today about DNA.
In particular,

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.240
we're going to focus today on
sort of how to manipulate and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.662
use DNA in some applications,
and this is a huge area of

00:00:25.662 --> 00:00:29.047
science and technology.
You know this,

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:33.492
you can - it's hard to pick up
a newspaper or a news magazine

00:00:33.492 --> 00:00:37.790
without hearing some new
application of DNA technology.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.197
What I'm going to do is focus
on a couple basic things that

00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:46.680
turn out to be really important
for general applications,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.000
and then I'll talk not in too
much detail about a few

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.022
applications of DNA that you're
probably familiar with to try to

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:56.640
give you a framework to hang
this on.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.328
This, I think Chapter 3,
describes fairly well the

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:05.875
things we'll talk about today.
You've probably already noticed

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.975
that there's some material
that's set aside from the text

00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:10.727
in boxes,
and I encourage you to

00:01:10.727 --> 00:01:13.250
particularly look at those boxes
for this chapter.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.557
There's one on DNA
fingerprinting,

00:01:15.557 --> 00:01:18.283
for example,
that gives you a little bit

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:21.500
more detail about that specific
technique;

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.580
another one on production of
therapeutic proteins.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.448
I'll talk about these both a
bit today but I encourage you to

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:32.238
read those for more information.
I want to start where we

00:01:32.238 --> 00:01:35.776
left off last time.
We talked about the structure

00:01:35.776 --> 00:01:41.065
of DNA, how it works in terms of
a physical chemical model of the

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:44.199
DNA molecules.
We talked about base pairing

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:47.780
and how that leads to this
process of hybridization or very

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.930
specific matching between
complimentary strands.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.030
We talked very superficially
about the biological process

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.600
going from DNA to protein,
so the process of

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.193
transcription,
RNA processing,

00:02:04.193 --> 00:02:07.769
and translation to produce a
protein.

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:13.616
I ended with this picture that
shows you a little bit about

00:02:13.616 --> 00:02:18.590
control of gene expression.
The important concept is that,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.758
while every cell in your body
has the capability of making all

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:26.379
the proteins that are needed
throughout your body,

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.659
not every cell is doing that at
any given time.

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.209
Only certain genes are being
expressed and it's the family of

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.470
genes that are being expressed
in a cell,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.304
likewise the family that are
not being expressed,

00:02:41.304 --> 00:02:44.340
that determines what a cell is
like,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.519
how it functions.
What's called the phenotype of

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.478
a cell and we'll talk more about
this next week when we start

00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:55.569
talking about cells and a little
bit about cell physiology.

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.741
There are multiple
mechanisms that a cell can use

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:02.217
to decide which genes it is
expressing at any one time and

00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:05.799
which ones are not expressed.
I showed you this in this

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.692
picture here and those levels of
control can be at the level of

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:13.187
transcription.
There are molecules in cells

00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:18.389
that give the DNA the signal
that it's time to transcribe and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.490
express a gene,
those are called transcription

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.750
factors, we'll talk about them a
bit later.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.470
There's interfering with RNA
processing, and I'm going to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.443
talk about that in the next
couple of slides because there's

00:03:33.443 --> 00:03:38.500
a couple of new methods for - or
potentially interfering with

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.305
gene expression in living
animals that have been developed

00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:48.446
based on changing - interfering
with DNA transcription and the

00:03:48.446 --> 00:03:52.830
ability of messenger RNA to be
translated.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.666
You could interfere at these
later levels as well,

00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.189
for example,
by augmenting RNA degradation.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:04.075
If the messenger RNA for
protein is not present in a

00:04:04.075 --> 00:04:07.579
cell, then that can't be
translated, obviously,

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.603
and the protein can't be made.
These two new medical

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:18.347
therapies that I mentioned are
based on interfering with the

00:04:18.347 --> 00:04:22.368
biology of RNA,
and one is older than the other

00:04:22.368 --> 00:04:25.879
and the older one is called
anti-sense therapy.

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:29.970
When you think about a gene or
a transcript,

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.300
the messenger RNA copy of a
gene,

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.727
you know that for every
sequence of a nucleic acid

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:40.889
there's a complimentary
sequence.

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.445
Now of the two complimentary
sequences, one of them encodes

00:04:45.445 --> 00:04:48.004
the gene.
One of them has the right

00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:52.002
sequence of codons to specify
the amino acid sequence of the

00:04:52.002 --> 00:04:56.000
protein, and the other one has a
complimentary sequence.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.446
You know from our discussion
last time that these two

00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:03.490
complimentary strands are not
mirror images of one another,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.740
they're not identical,
they're complimentary.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.131
They face in the opposite
direction and you could predict

00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:12.825
the properties of one from base
pairing rules of the other but

00:05:12.825 --> 00:05:16.350
they're not the same.
One of the strands encodes the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.970
protein, encodes for the
protein, the other does not.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.398
The one that does is called the
sense strand and the other one

00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:26.693
is called the anti-sense strand,
anti meaning it's the

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:29.790
compliment and it will hybridize
to the sense.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.360
What if you knew what the
sequence of a gene was?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.829
A gene, let's say it's the gene
for insulin.

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:42.040
I'll use that one as the
example because it's a familiar

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.717
one to most people and you know
that the protein insulin is made

00:05:45.717 --> 00:05:49.220
only in your pancreas and
certain cells of the pancreas.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.730
So that means those cells are
continually making messenger RNA

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.009
and that messenger RNA is being
converted into protein.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.753
Well, what if you knew the
sequence for the messenger RNA

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:03.563
that made insulin and you
designed another single stranded

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:07.040
DNA or RNA molecule that was the
exact opposite,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.568
or the exact compliment,
I should say,

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:12.898
of that strand?
So you made somehow an

00:06:12.898 --> 00:06:19.208
anti-sense polynucleotide to the
insulin gene or some fraction of

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:23.116
the insulin gene.
Well, that anti-sense

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:27.997
strand is shown here as the red
and the cell is naturally making

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:32.412
the blue or sense strand of
messenger RNA for a particular

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:35.365
protein.
If somehow you could take your

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:39.516
anti-sense molecules that you've
made and you could get them into

00:06:39.516 --> 00:06:41.945
cells,
then by this process of

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:46.600
hybridization they would
naturally form a pair like this.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.228
They would naturally hybridize
and form a duplex,

00:06:51.228 --> 00:06:54.699
or a double stranded nucleic
acid.

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.348
When it's double stranded this
gene can't be translated,

00:06:59.348 --> 00:07:04.250
because you have to have the
single strand in order for the

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:09.153
transfer RNA to bind and for
this process of translation to

00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:12.262
take place.
What you could do then,

00:07:12.262 --> 00:07:16.551
if you could deliver these red
colored molecules here is you

00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:20.622
could stop specifically the
expression of this particular

00:07:20.622 --> 00:07:24.381
gene in these particular cells.
Now, what are the

00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:26.693
challenges there?
You've got to be able to make

00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:29.222
this stuff and you've got to be
able to make it in large

00:07:29.222 --> 00:07:31.935
quantities and we'll talk about
how to make nucleic acids in

00:07:31.935 --> 00:07:34.509
large quantities a little bit
later in the lecture.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:37.769
You've also got to get it into
the cell.

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:41.538
It turns out that getting large
molecules like this,

00:07:41.538 --> 00:07:45.603
particularly large charged
molecules like nucleic acids,

00:07:45.603 --> 00:07:49.518
inside of cells is not so easy.
We'll talk about that a little

00:07:49.518 --> 00:07:52.084
bit later as well.
In fact, we'll talk about that

00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:55.014
concept throughout the course
because one of the big

00:07:55.014 --> 00:07:58.635
challenges of making these sort
of new biological therapies work

00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:02.198
in people to treat diseases is
getting the right molecules into

00:08:02.198 --> 00:08:05.600
the right cells,
at the right period of time.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.014
Now I gave you the example
of insulin and you probably

00:08:09.014 --> 00:08:11.589
wouldn't want to stop insulin
production.

00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:14.250
That might not be a good thing
to do.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:18.259
What if this is a gene that's
causing a cell to be cancerous?

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:22.383
It was a gene that was causing
a cell to be malignant and to

00:08:22.383 --> 00:08:25.040
divide without control,
for example.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.221
Then you could imagine blocking
gene expression would be a

00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:28.780
therapy.

00:08:34.269 --> 00:08:35.468
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:08:35.468 --> 00:08:36.588
Mark Saltzman:
You wouldn't want to stop

00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:38.739
insulin, for example.
In fact what you might prefer

00:08:38.739 --> 00:08:41.478
to do is start insulin
production and we'll talk about

00:08:41.478 --> 00:08:43.340
ways to do that in just a
minute.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:46.062
These are ways to stop a gene
from being expressed,

00:08:46.062 --> 00:08:49.220
and there turns out there's lot
of applications in that,

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.906
lots of diseases result from
the unwanted expression of

00:08:52.906 --> 00:08:56.524
certain kinds of genes and
cancer is probably the best

00:08:56.524 --> 00:09:00.929
example of that,
but there are many.

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:04.905
A newer version of this
that works in a similar way but

00:09:04.905 --> 00:09:07.990
a different way is called RNA
interference,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.252
and it turns out that this is a
natural mechanism that cells

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:14.241
have.
It's a mechanism that they have

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:18.940
evolved in order to prevent
foreign genes from entering a

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.185
cell and being expressed.
You have mechanisms inside your

00:09:24.185 --> 00:09:29.603
natural mechanisms inside your
cell that allow the cells to

00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:34.440
degrade unwanted RNA sequences.
Those mechanisms are called RNA

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.513
interference.
You might have heard about this

00:09:38.513 --> 00:09:43.980
because it's been quite an
active area of science.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.240
It turns out to activate
RNA interference,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.460
you deliver double stranded
RNA.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:57.558
Certain double stranded RNA
sequences will cause in the cell

00:09:57.558 --> 00:10:03.450
a process of degradation of very
specific RNA sequence.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.523
This involves mechanisms that
are still being understood,

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:11.306
but if you've studied some
biology or read about this

00:10:11.306 --> 00:10:15.379
you've heard about the protein
complex called Dicer.

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:21.259
Dicer is an internal cellular
mechanism for degrading RNA's.

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:26.199
You might have also heard about
the RISC complex,

00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:31.054
or the RNA silencing complex,
and these are the biological

00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:34.443
mechanisms that are involved
here and only shown by orange

00:10:34.443 --> 00:10:37.694
arrows on this slide.
The end result is you can

00:10:37.694 --> 00:10:41.779
design now very specific double
stranded RNA sequences,

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:46.333
that when delivered into cells
again will activate this process

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:50.299
of natural degradation of an
existing messenger RNA.

00:10:50.299 --> 00:10:54.687
Of course, if you degrade the
messenger RNA at a rapid rate

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:57.940
than you'll stop expression of
the cells.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.597
Now the nice thing about
this is that the degradation

00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:05.059
mechanisms seem to persist for
some period of time,

00:11:05.059 --> 00:11:09.919
beyond the time at which you
deliver the double stranded RNA;

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.850
whereas, obviously,
this mechanism here is only

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.355
going to exist for as long as
the anti-sense sequence is

00:11:16.355 --> 00:11:19.817
present.
So this might be a longer

00:11:19.817 --> 00:11:26.399
lasting, more permanent form of
elimination of expression of a

00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.450
particular gene.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:35.113
I just wanted to introduce
those concepts because you've

00:11:35.113 --> 00:11:37.733
read about them;
we'll be talking more about RNA

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:40.899
interference in particular as we
go on through the course.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:44.327
The rest of the time I want to
talk about expression of genes,

00:11:44.327 --> 00:11:46.253
of new genes.
Taking foreign genes,

00:11:46.253 --> 00:11:49.039
genes that aren't naturally
expressed or might not even

00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:52.032
exist inside a cell and putting
them there and putting them

00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:55.792
there in a way where they work,
and by work meaning the gene

00:11:55.792 --> 00:11:58.850
gets expressed or translated
into a protein.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.766
I'm going to start by
talking about a very specific

00:12:02.766 --> 00:12:07.046
and interesting form of double
stranded DNA called a plasmid

00:12:07.046 --> 00:12:12.294
and plasmids occur in nature.
Plasmids turn out to be one of

00:12:12.294 --> 00:12:17.146
the most powerful and simplest
examples of a vector,

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:22.570
what's called a vector for
delivering DNA into a cell.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.946
Now the challenge is not just
to get the DNA that encodes a

00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:29.704
gene into a cell,
the challenge is to get it into

00:12:29.704 --> 00:12:31.669
the cell in a form where the
cell can use it,

00:12:31.669 --> 00:12:34.860
can express it and make
proteins from it.

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.149
The plasmid has some features
which allow it to do that.

00:12:39.149 --> 00:12:42.237
Now to start with,
the plasmid is usually shown in

00:12:42.237 --> 00:12:46.393
a diagram like this as a circle.
It's a double stranded circular

00:12:46.393 --> 00:12:48.990
piece of DNA,
meaning that the 3尧,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.269
5尧
ends that hang off are joined

00:12:52.269 --> 00:12:56.320
back together again to form a
continuous loop.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.049
Again, these plasmids occur
naturally in nature;

00:13:00.049 --> 00:13:03.858
they were discovered
particularly in micro-organisms

00:13:03.858 --> 00:13:08.340
have plasmids that confer
biological properties onto them.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.840
This particular example of
a plasmid has several regions.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.324
Now, in your book,
there's an example of plasmid

00:13:16.324 --> 00:13:20.624
where I've given you the exact
sequence of nucleotides that

00:13:20.624 --> 00:13:24.480
makes up the whole double
stranded DNA molecule.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.808
I just give you one of those,
right, because you could write

00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:31.081
down the other one because you
know the other complimentary

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:34.205
sequence from base pairing?
One of the things about these

00:13:34.205 --> 00:13:37.099
plasmids that makes them very
useful is that their entire base

00:13:37.099 --> 00:13:40.837
pair sequences is known.
So you know everywhere on this

00:13:40.837 --> 00:13:45.425
picture you could write down
exactly what the sequence of

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:49.029
nucleotides are that make up
this vector.

00:13:49.029 --> 00:13:52.715
This region here of this
particular plasmid is called the

00:13:52.715 --> 00:13:55.049
ori or origin of
replication.

00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:58.381
Remember we talked about how
DNA replicates itself and that

00:13:58.381 --> 00:14:01.591
there are enzymes,
DNA polymerase that bind to the

00:14:01.591 --> 00:14:03.720
double stranded DNA,
separate it,

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.314
denature it locally,
and then start the process of

00:14:07.314 --> 00:14:09.683
replication.
One of the properties that you

00:14:09.683 --> 00:14:12.666
would like a plasmid to have is
you'd like for cells to be able

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.879
to replicate it,
to make more copies of it.

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:18.048
That way you could deliver a
small number of vectors and they

00:14:18.048 --> 00:14:20.529
could amplify into a large
number of vectors.

00:14:20.529 --> 00:14:24.806
So having a place that the cell
knows - where the cell knows how

00:14:24.806 --> 00:14:28.743
to replicate is important and so
plasmids have an origin of

00:14:28.743 --> 00:14:31.611
replication.
The blue region here is a

00:14:31.611 --> 00:14:33.577
gene.
It's a gene that's on the

00:14:33.577 --> 00:14:36.836
plasmid, and this particular
gene confers a specific

00:14:36.836 --> 00:14:40.478
biological property to cells
that have the plasmid and can

00:14:40.478 --> 00:14:44.521
use it properly.
The property it gives here is

00:14:44.521 --> 00:14:48.620
called AMP^(R) or resistance to
Ampicillin.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:52.562
Ampicillin is an antibiotic.
Antibiotics are chemicals,

00:14:52.562 --> 00:14:57.377
usually small organic molecules
that will kill micro-organisms

00:14:57.377 --> 00:15:01.990
like bacteria.
If a cell has a gene that makes

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:06.949
it resistant to Ampicillin,
that means that that

00:15:06.949 --> 00:15:13.595
micro-organism can survive being
exposed to this normally deadly

00:15:13.595 --> 00:15:18.853
chemical without dying.
This is one of the biological

00:15:18.853 --> 00:15:22.666
properties, the naturally
occurring properties of

00:15:22.666 --> 00:15:25.646
plasmids,
is that they exist in microbial

00:15:25.646 --> 00:15:29.699
populations and they confer on
them resistance from toxins that

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.095
would ordinarily kill them.
So being a micro-organism that

00:15:33.095 --> 00:15:35.679
got a plasmid that give you
resistance to an antibiotic

00:15:35.679 --> 00:15:38.550
would be a good thing - that
gave you resistance to something

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:41.612
that naturally killed cells like
you in your environment would be

00:15:41.612 --> 00:15:44.666
a good thing.
We're going to use that

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:49.316
Ampicillin resistance in
technological ways and I'll

00:15:49.316 --> 00:15:53.228
describe that in a minute.
The rest of this,

00:15:53.228 --> 00:15:56.672
this sort of beige part of the
molecule here is called the

00:15:56.672 --> 00:15:59.160
polylinker part.
This is where - this is the

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.940
region of the plasmid where
we're going to insert the DNA

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.203
that we're interested in.
We're going to have DNA that we

00:16:05.203 --> 00:16:08.465
would like to make lots of
copies of, or we're going to

00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:11.970
have DNA that we would like to
get expressed in a cell,

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.754
and we're going to put it in
this region that's called the

00:16:14.754 --> 00:16:17.776
polylinker.
How we do that will be clear in

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:20.777
a few minutes,
but this polylinker as is

00:16:20.777 --> 00:16:25.550
described down here is a site
where you can clone in genes.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:33.778
Let's assume that we have
this plasmid cloning vector and

00:16:33.778 --> 00:16:37.779
we have some pieces of DNA that
we would like to put into a

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:41.159
plasmid that we would like to
make copies of.

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:44.752
DNA cloning,
or any kind of cloning just

00:16:44.752 --> 00:16:48.830
means 'making copies of'.
So the process of cloning DNA

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.230
is taking a few strands of DNA
of a gene that you're interested

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.259
in and making many copies of
them,

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.154
that's cloning,
you like to make identical

00:16:57.154 --> 00:16:59.266
copies.
This vector is going to allow

00:16:59.266 --> 00:17:02.210
us to do this.
The first step in the

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.659
process is to take our plasmid
which we've selected,

00:17:06.659 --> 00:17:10.759
and to insert the gene that we
want into it.

00:17:10.759 --> 00:17:13.359
For a minute just assume that
we can do this and I'm going to

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.180
show you how to do it on the
next slide.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.820
The first step is to take the
DNA fragments that we're

00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:23.148
interested in and put them into
this vector by basically cutting

00:17:23.148 --> 00:17:27.476
open the double stranded DNA and
inserting the gene that we like

00:17:27.476 --> 00:17:32.771
in the region where we've cut.
Then we're going to take the

00:17:32.771 --> 00:17:37.306
newly formed vectors that now
are recombinant,

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:42.950
they're combined from at least
two different sources.

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.851
The sources are:
one, the plasmid vector that

00:17:45.851 --> 00:17:48.622
we've picked,
and the second is these genes

00:17:48.622 --> 00:17:51.589
that for some reason we're
interested in.

00:17:51.589 --> 00:17:53.904
They might have come from two
completely different places,

00:17:53.904 --> 00:17:56.341
from two completely different
species from different parts of

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:59.899
the world,
and they're put together in a

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:05.259
new way and that's why it's
called recombinant DNA.

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:09.981
Then we're going to take these
plasmid vectors and we're going

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:14.547
to somehow put them in contact
with cells in such a way that

00:18:14.547 --> 00:18:18.029
the cells ingest the DNA and
they use it.

00:18:18.029 --> 00:18:21.867
In this particular example
here we're exposing these

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:26.045
plasmids to bacterial cells.
That's shown in this diagram as

00:18:26.045 --> 00:18:29.880
little colonies of bacteria that
are growing on a plate.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:33.462
You've probably seen agar
plates, if you smear a solution

00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:36.150
that's contaminated with
bacteria on it,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.864
then that bacteria will grow on
this agar rich medium and you'll

00:18:39.864 --> 00:18:43.342
get many, many copies of the
bacteria that you've smeared at

00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:46.877
low density onto the plate.
That's a way of culturing or

00:18:46.877 --> 00:18:49.927
propagating bacteria.
Well, if you do that under the

00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:52.716
situation where you've put your
plasmid into these

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:55.904
micro-organisms then you're
going to have little colonies

00:18:55.904 --> 00:18:58.750
that grow many copies of the
bacterial cells.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.493
Hopefully each one of those
cells is containing one or more

00:19:01.493 --> 00:19:04.047
of the plasmids that you're
interested in and those are

00:19:04.047 --> 00:19:07.745
being copied as well.
So what you get on the plate is

00:19:07.745 --> 00:19:12.940
many copies of the small number
of plasmids that you've put in.

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:16.554
Now how do you find those
colonies on a plate that have

00:19:16.554 --> 00:19:20.865
the plasmid that you want?
Well, that's a trick and there

00:19:20.865 --> 00:19:25.581
are multiple ways to do that.
One way is to allow these

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:31.004
bacteria to grow on a plate that
is loaded with antibiotics like

00:19:31.004 --> 00:19:34.102
Ampicillin.
If this plate has Ampicillin in

00:19:34.102 --> 00:19:37.643
it, then the only cells that
would be able to grow here are

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:40.329
cells that have resistance to
Ampicillin.

00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:44.556
If you selected the cells right
than the only ones that have

00:19:44.556 --> 00:19:48.782
that resistance to Ampicillin
are the ones that successfully

00:19:48.782 --> 00:19:53.509
got your plasmid and are using
this Ampicillin resistant gene.

00:19:53.509 --> 00:19:57.891
You could imagine strategies
where you have multiple

00:19:57.891 --> 00:20:02.448
resistance genes on a plasmid,
resistance to Ampicillin,

00:20:02.448 --> 00:20:05.488
to Penicillin,
to Erythromycin for example,

00:20:05.488 --> 00:20:09.757
and you design strategies for
separating out which cells are

00:20:09.757 --> 00:20:13.519
carrying the plasmid that you're
interested in.

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:19.803
This process of using a
biological event like resistance

00:20:19.803 --> 00:20:26.429
to Ampicillin in order to pick
out the cell population that

00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:31.569
you're interested in is called
selection.

00:20:31.569 --> 00:20:35.048
If we grew these cells on a
plate loaded with Ampicillin and

00:20:35.048 --> 00:20:38.349
we could select cells that have
Ampicillin resistance,

00:20:38.349 --> 00:20:42.105
and this process of selection
and cell culture is very

00:20:42.105 --> 00:20:45.720
important and we'll talk about
it more next week.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.081
How did we put our gene
fragments into this plasmid DNA

00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:54.820
in order to make multiple copies
of it, or to clone the gene?

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:59.761
Well, it involves several steps.
The first step is we had to be

00:20:59.761 --> 00:21:03.831
able to take this circular DNA
and cut it to create a site for

00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:09.296
our new gene to be added.
That cutting is done by special

00:21:09.296 --> 00:21:13.589
proteins called restriction
enzymes.

00:21:13.589 --> 00:21:16.205
Restriction enzymes are just a
kind of enzyme,

00:21:16.205 --> 00:21:19.750
enzymes are protein molecules
that make a chemical reaction go

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.420
faster,
and the chemical reaction that

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:25.059
restriction enzymes do is
cutting DNA.

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:29.614
They do that in a very special
way in that they - restriction

00:21:29.614 --> 00:21:34.244
enzymes are able to identify a
particular sequence of bases in

00:21:34.244 --> 00:21:37.017
a gene.
There's whole families of

00:21:37.017 --> 00:21:40.033
restriction enzymes.
There are hundreds,

00:21:40.033 --> 00:21:44.703
thousands of them known now,
and each one has a specific

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:50.053
character and one aspects of its
character is that it only binds

00:21:50.053 --> 00:21:53.960
and cuts at a particular
sequence of DNA.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:59.034
This particular restriction
enzyme here recognizes this

00:21:59.034 --> 00:22:03.649
sequence, GAATTC.
When it sees that sequence in a

00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:08.759
double stranded DNA it will bind
there and it will cut.

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:12.024
Now another property of
restriction enzymes is that they

00:22:12.024 --> 00:22:14.220
always cut the DNA in the same
way.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.511
In this case,
this particular restriction

00:22:17.511 --> 00:22:22.859
enzyme cuts symmetrically like
this, but not at the same point.

00:22:22.859 --> 00:22:26.953
It doesn't cut straight across
the double stranded DNA but it

00:22:26.953 --> 00:22:30.742
cuts in this jagged fashion.
That is, it cuts between the G

00:22:30.742 --> 00:22:33.297
and the A here,
and it cuts between the G and

00:22:33.297 --> 00:22:36.672
the A here.
When it cuts it leaves sticky

00:22:36.672 --> 00:22:41.973
ends or un-base paired single
stranded regions on each end of

00:22:41.973 --> 00:22:47.451
the part its cut and that's just
a property of many restriction

00:22:47.451 --> 00:22:50.847
enzymes;
not all, some cut blunt,

00:22:50.847 --> 00:22:57.347
just right down the middle.
Most restriction enzyme also

00:22:57.347 --> 00:23:05.380
recognize symmetric sequences of
DNA, GAATTC for example.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.790
If you do the base pairing goes
exactly the same sequence

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.943
backwards down here.
That's an example of symmetric

00:23:11.943 --> 00:23:15.388
sequence and it happens that
most restriction enzymes also

00:23:15.388 --> 00:23:19.555
recognize those spaces.
If you cut and you open up

00:23:19.555 --> 00:23:24.140
a segment of DNA then you've
left these sticky ends,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.655
for example,
and these sticky ends are

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:30.056
capable of recognizing each
other by the process of

00:23:30.056 --> 00:23:33.248
hybridization.
These will naturally want to

00:23:33.248 --> 00:23:37.326
reform and they'll want to
reform to re-establish this base

00:23:37.326 --> 00:23:39.912
pairing.
They could be pasted back

00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:43.974
together, and the pasting
process takes advantage of this

00:23:43.974 --> 00:23:47.599
natural process of complimentary
hybridization.

00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:50.769
This gives you a biological
mechanism for cutting,

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:55.087
using restriction enzymes,
and then you denature so that

00:23:55.087 --> 00:23:58.891
it falls apart,
and then you renature so that

00:23:58.891 --> 00:24:02.973
it comes back together.
Cutting involves enzymes

00:24:02.973 --> 00:24:06.574
called restriction endonucleases
or restriction enzymes,

00:24:06.574 --> 00:24:09.980
which I've already mentioned
and they have names.

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:13.320
Restriction enzymes have names,
the particular one that does

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.718
this function here is called
EcoRI. The names all look

00:24:16.718 --> 00:24:19.832
- they're all italicized and
they're capital letters and

00:24:19.832 --> 00:24:23.740
small letters so that they won't
be easy for you to understand,

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.884
but they are - if you know the
nomenclature,

00:24:26.884 --> 00:24:29.699
easy to understand.
This restriction enzyme was

00:24:29.699 --> 00:24:31.738
found in a natural source,
it was found in a

00:24:31.738 --> 00:24:35.035
micro-organism called E.
coli. The first three

00:24:35.035 --> 00:24:39.579
letters of E.
Coli are Eco, so Eco.

00:24:39.579 --> 00:24:41.779
It was found in strain R,
a particular strain of E.

00:24:41.779 --> 00:24:45.779
coli, and it was the first
one found, so EcoRI .

00:24:45.779 --> 00:24:47.549
There's a nomenclature that's
evolved for this.

00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:50.172
Now we know so much about
these, they've turned out to be

00:24:50.172 --> 00:24:53.124
so useful in biotechnology.
There are whole catalogs that

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:55.390
you go to and buy restriction
enzymes.

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.305
You can look up in the catalog.
What are the properties of this

00:24:58.305 --> 00:25:01.081
restriction enzymes?
What base sequence does it

00:25:01.081 --> 00:25:03.019
recognize?
How does it cut?

00:25:03.019 --> 00:25:05.960
What concentration do I need to
use to achieve that?

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.967
So if you have plasmid where
you know all the base pairings

00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:12.182
than you could go through that
plasmid and say I want to cut it

00:25:12.182 --> 00:25:15.089
right here.
What restriction will do that?

00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:20.044
Or you could ask the question,
I have this restriction enzyme,

00:25:20.044 --> 00:25:23.779
at what regions on this plasmid
will it cut?

00:25:23.779 --> 00:25:27.438
The pasting back together
occurs partly naturally by this

00:25:27.438 --> 00:25:30.304
process of hybridization,
but hybridization only

00:25:30.304 --> 00:25:34.229
re-establishes the base pairing.
You know that these molecules

00:25:34.229 --> 00:25:37.688
are also linked in another way,
by the phosphate bonds that

00:25:37.688 --> 00:25:40.290
connect the 3尧
and the 5尧

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.805
carbons of adjacent nucleotides.
That doesn't heal naturally but

00:25:43.805 --> 00:25:46.678
can be reformed by other enzymes
called ligases,

00:25:46.678 --> 00:25:49.490
ligases re-established the
phosphate bonds.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.616
How would I put a gene that
I'm interested in into a

00:25:57.616 --> 00:26:00.209
plasmid?
Well the first step would be to

00:26:00.209 --> 00:26:03.710
cut open the plasmid with a
particular restriction enzyme,

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.882
and then what if I take that
same restriction enzyme and I

00:26:07.882 --> 00:26:10.809
cut up the DNA that I'm
interested in.

00:26:10.809 --> 00:26:15.330
If I cut both the plasmid and
my DNA of interest with the same

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:19.999
restriction enzyme I'm going to
end up with the same sticky ends

00:26:19.999 --> 00:26:23.329
on both molecules.
Now if I put them in contact

00:26:23.329 --> 00:26:26.181
with one another,
the plasmid that's been opened

00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:29.397
and fragments of the DNA -
special fragments that I've

00:26:29.397 --> 00:26:32.250
produced with the same
restriction enzyme,

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:34.919
they'll have the same sticky
ends, they will naturally

00:26:34.919 --> 00:26:37.554
hybridize with one another.
I apply ligase,

00:26:37.554 --> 00:26:42.485
and I've got the plasmid that I
had before but now with my gene,

00:26:42.485 --> 00:26:44.990
colored green here,
inserted.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.092
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:26:55.092 --> 00:26:56.243
Mark Saltzman: That's a
really good question because if

00:26:56.243 --> 00:26:58.165
I open this up,
why wouldn't it just reform

00:26:58.165 --> 00:27:01.200
with itself, why would it want
to have this in here?

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.891
The answer is it will want to
reform with itself,

00:27:03.891 --> 00:27:07.424
and if I have these in solution
than how many reform with itself

00:27:07.424 --> 00:27:10.789
and how many reform with the
molecule I'm interested probably

00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:13.705
depends on the relative
concentrations of both in the

00:27:13.705 --> 00:27:16.510
solution and what conditions I
have it at.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:19.498
It's a statistical process.
Some are going to reform and

00:27:19.498 --> 00:27:22.615
some are going to reform with
the gene in, and some probably

00:27:22.615 --> 00:27:25.731
aren't going to reseal at all
under the conditions that I've

00:27:25.731 --> 00:27:29.323
used.
Not every plasmid in your test

00:27:29.323 --> 00:27:35.859
tube is going to have the right
gene inserted in the right way.

00:27:35.859 --> 00:27:42.286
One way that you can look
for that gene that you want is

00:27:42.286 --> 00:27:48.168
by making the cut in your
plasmid inside of a gene that

00:27:48.168 --> 00:27:55.029
encodes for some property like
resistance to an antibiotic.

00:27:55.029 --> 00:27:58.723
If this reforms,
so the plasmid reforms back to

00:27:58.723 --> 00:28:01.935
its native state,
that resistance will be

00:28:01.935 --> 00:28:04.964
recovered.
So bacteria that get an

00:28:04.964 --> 00:28:10.099
unloaded plasmid are going to
have resistance to antibiotics.

00:28:10.099 --> 00:28:12.675
If your gene goes in,
you've interrupted the gene for

00:28:12.675 --> 00:28:15.796
antibiotic resistance and those
new organisms aren't going to be

00:28:15.796 --> 00:28:19.374
resistant to antibiotic anymore.
So you could use sort of

00:28:19.374 --> 00:28:23.859
negative selection in order to
find the ones that you want.

00:28:23.859 --> 00:28:28.289
I don't know if that makes
sense or not but -

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:32.919
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:28:32.919 --> 00:28:37.284
Mark Saltzman: Some do,
but there's an advantage to

00:28:37.284 --> 00:28:40.279
having the sticky end there and
that you can put things back on,

00:28:40.279 --> 00:28:44.207
but there are also methods to
chemically produce a sticky end

00:28:44.207 --> 00:28:47.807
where you can take blunt ends
and you could add specific

00:28:47.807 --> 00:28:51.930
nucleotides onto one of the DNA
chains by either doing chemistry

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.089
on a 3尧
or the 5尧

00:28:54.089 --> 00:28:56.490
end and create your own sticky
end.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.915
Sometimes a blunt cut is useful
if you want to sort of grow a

00:29:01.915 --> 00:29:06.514
sticky end of your choice on it.
You're starting to see that

00:29:06.514 --> 00:29:10.070
there's all different ways that
one could take advantage of this

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.779
fairly simple process of cutting
and pasting.

00:29:12.779 --> 00:29:16.495
That's why molecular biology,
one of the reasons why it's

00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:19.150
turned out to be such a powerful
tool,

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.873
because if you can think
creatively you can find all

00:29:21.873 --> 00:29:24.758
different ways to using these
very simple principles to

00:29:24.758 --> 00:29:28.546
recombine molecules,
to make unique new DNA

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:29.800
sequences.

00:29:34.049 --> 00:29:36.539
Where does the DNA sequence
come from?

00:29:36.539 --> 00:29:38.440
I want to spend a little time
talking about that.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.287
Say we've got a human gene that
we want to make and let's say

00:29:41.287 --> 00:29:44.230
it's the human gene for insulin
that we want to produce now.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:48.500
All the cells in your body have
the gene for insulin in them.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.181
Only cells in the pancreas,
some cells in the pancreas are

00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:55.865
making insulin.
One way I could try to find the

00:29:55.865 --> 00:30:00.869
gene for human insulin is to
take any cells from any of us,

00:30:00.869 --> 00:30:05.076
skin cells let's say,
and I could identify where on

00:30:05.076 --> 00:30:09.619
the chromosomal DNA that insulin
is likely to occur.

00:30:09.619 --> 00:30:12.945
I could cut that up into
fragments, and I could search in

00:30:12.945 --> 00:30:16.389
these fragments to try to find
the one that has the insulin

00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:19.058
gene on it.
Now the problem with that

00:30:19.058 --> 00:30:22.799
is a problem I mentioned before,
that most human genes are not

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:26.478
just a straight sequence from
beginning to end of the protein

00:30:26.478 --> 00:30:29.841
that you're interested in.
There are encoding regions

00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:32.708
called exons and those are
interrupted by non-coding

00:30:32.708 --> 00:30:36.503
regions called introns.
If I cut up just DNA from the

00:30:36.503 --> 00:30:40.929
chromosome, what's called
genomic DNA, then I'm going to

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:45.274
have both exons and introns
within the fragments that I

00:30:45.274 --> 00:30:48.137
create.
That might be a good way to do

00:30:48.137 --> 00:30:52.059
it but it's going to be more of
a challenge because you might -

00:30:52.059 --> 00:30:55.854
you're going to have a lot of
these non-coding sequences that

00:30:55.854 --> 00:30:58.895
are in the way.
An alternate way is to go

00:30:58.895 --> 00:31:02.140
to the cell that's making the
protein that you want.

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.398
If it's making the protein you
want, it must be producing

00:31:05.398 --> 00:31:07.609
messenger RNA with that gene one
it.

00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:11.223
That messenger RNA that's being
used has already gone through

00:31:11.223 --> 00:31:14.957
the RNA splicing mechanism and
so the introns have already been

00:31:14.957 --> 00:31:17.426
removed.
If I could isolate that

00:31:17.426 --> 00:31:21.906
messenger RNA - messenger RNA is
just a copy of the DNA from

00:31:21.906 --> 00:31:26.007
which it came - so if I could do
the process of reverse

00:31:26.007 --> 00:31:28.606
transcription,
that is instead of

00:31:28.606 --> 00:31:32.076
transcription which goes from
DNA to RNA, if I could go

00:31:32.076 --> 00:31:35.559
backwards from RNA to DNA,
I could recover a DNA version

00:31:35.559 --> 00:31:37.569
of the gene that I'm interested
in.

00:31:37.569 --> 00:31:40.500
It turns out that we can do
that now because we have an

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.420
enzyme called reverse
transcriptase,

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.116
which is able to take single
stranded messenger RNA and make

00:31:47.116 --> 00:31:50.542
DNA out of it.
Now you've heard about reverse

00:31:50.542 --> 00:31:53.339
transcriptase someplace before,
right?

00:31:53.339 --> 00:31:56.269
Anybody heard of reverse
transcriptase?

00:31:56.269 --> 00:31:58.329
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:31:58.329 --> 00:32:00.119
Mark Saltzman:
 HIV, HIV is a natural

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:01.910
virus that contains an enzyme in
it.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.039
Why does it contain reverse
transcriptase in it?

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:09.423
Because HIV is an RNA virus and
if it enters your cell the only

00:32:09.423 --> 00:32:13.725
way it can replicate,
it can put its DNA into your

00:32:13.725 --> 00:32:18.089
cells, is by first making DNA
out of its RNA genome.

00:32:18.089 --> 00:32:19.920
We're going to talk more about
this later.

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.276
Reverse transcriptase is a
naturally occurring protein,

00:32:24.276 --> 00:32:27.130
it has a biological function in
HIV,

00:32:27.130 --> 00:32:31.450
but we can use it for a
technical logical function here

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:35.849
by going backwards on the
biological path from messenger

00:32:35.849 --> 00:32:38.834
RNA to DNA.
Now DNA that's produced this

00:32:38.834 --> 00:32:42.593
way is not called genomic DNA
because this doesn't match the

00:32:42.593 --> 00:32:45.079
DNA in your genome,
on your chromosomes,

00:32:45.079 --> 00:32:47.029
right?
The introns are gone now.

00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:50.150
It's called cDNA or
complimentary DNA to indicate

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.009
that it's a copy,
a complimentary copy of the

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:55.817
messenger RNA.
This is a much more

00:32:55.817 --> 00:33:00.162
efficient way to get DNA for a
gene that you're interested for

00:33:00.162 --> 00:33:02.884
a couple of reasons.
One is the processing has

00:33:02.884 --> 00:33:04.966
already been done so the introns
are already out,

00:33:04.966 --> 00:33:07.439
so you don't have to figure out
what's exon and what's the

00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:09.180
intron,
it's already done for you.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.891
Plus, if you're looking for
insulin, if you're looking for

00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:16.603
the gene for insulin you're
going to cells that are making

00:33:16.603 --> 00:33:19.403
it already,
they have abundant messenger

00:33:19.403 --> 00:33:22.985
RNA so it's much easier to
separate out and identify the

00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:26.398
gene that you're interested in.
You're not fishing through a

00:33:26.398 --> 00:33:28.411
whole chromosome in order to
find what you want,

00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:30.980
but you're going to a cell
that's already enriched in it.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.340
Does that make sense?

00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.538
I want to talk about one other
technique and then I'm going to

00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:42.556
give you some examples about how
to use these in the last few

00:33:42.556 --> 00:33:44.892
minutes.
The technique I want to talk

00:33:44.892 --> 00:33:47.799
about is one called Polymerase
Chain Reaction.

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:51.450
This is another way to clone or
make many copies of a gene of

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.942
interest.
Now one of the big advantages

00:33:53.942 --> 00:33:57.273
of plasmids, I already
mentioned, is that you can take

00:33:57.273 --> 00:34:00.981
this plasmid and a plasmid is
one - you can think of it as a

00:34:00.981 --> 00:34:03.809
highly tuned machine for copying
itself.

00:34:03.809 --> 00:34:07.453
A plasmid is a highly tuned
machine for making copies of

00:34:07.453 --> 00:34:09.230
itself.
You take that plasmid;

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.604
you put in the micro-organism
you're going to make many,

00:34:11.604 --> 00:34:14.358
many copies of that plasmid.
We're cloning a gene of

00:34:14.358 --> 00:34:17.529
interest to us by sort of
hijacking that biological

00:34:17.529 --> 00:34:21.334
mechanism by putting our gene on
this plasmid and so our gene

00:34:21.334 --> 00:34:24.945
gets copied many times,
as the plasmid gets copied many

00:34:24.945 --> 00:34:27.260
times.
That's a way of cloning DNA.

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.559
Here's another - that's a
biological way of cloning it.

00:34:30.559 --> 00:34:33.780
We're using biological
mechanisms and we're growing

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.721
cells in order to accomplish it.
Here's a way that you can

00:34:37.721 --> 00:34:41.285
do it in a test tube without
using any cells by this process

00:34:41.285 --> 00:34:43.460
called Polymerase Chain
Reaction.

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:47.630
I'll describe how it works here.
You have a fragment of some

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:51.530
kind of DNA that you would like
to clone or make many copies of.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.719
Now in general these are small
fragments.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:35:00.016
They're not whole genomes,
but they're some small piece of

00:35:00.016 --> 00:35:04.507
DNA maybe the size of a protein.
You put this chromosomal DNA or

00:35:04.507 --> 00:35:08.362
this DNA that you're interested
in, double stranded into a test

00:35:08.362 --> 00:35:10.287
tube.
You do that together with

00:35:10.287 --> 00:35:13.427
primers and with nucleotides,
because if you're going to

00:35:13.427 --> 00:35:16.340
synthesize DNA you need the raw
material of DNA,

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:18.280
you need the individual
nucleotides.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.932
You add a special DNA
polymerase called Taq

00:35:21.932 --> 00:35:25.309
polymerase is a polymerase that
was identified,

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:28.460
a DNA polymerase that was
identified from an organism that

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.555
lives in regions of the earth
that are constantly at high

00:35:31.555 --> 00:35:33.615
temperature.
Taq stands for

00:35:33.615 --> 00:35:36.582
thermos aquaticus,
it's a marine micro-organism

00:35:36.582 --> 00:35:39.213
that lives near these
hydrothermal events in the

00:35:39.213 --> 00:35:42.740
bottom of the sea and they live
under very high temperatures and

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.213
pressures all the time.
So their enzymes are tuned,

00:35:46.213 --> 00:35:49.270
unlike our enzymes,
which are tuned for working

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:53.037
most efficiently at 37°
centigrade, Taq is used

00:35:53.037 --> 00:35:55.920
to living at 90°
centigrade.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.116
So its enzymes operate most
efficiently at this elevated

00:35:59.116 --> 00:36:02.407
temperature.
You take advantage of that,

00:36:02.407 --> 00:36:06.802
you put it in a test tube,
together with nucleotides and

00:36:06.802 --> 00:36:10.378
primers and your DNA.
Now you start a process,

00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:13.419
a cyclic process,
where the first step in the

00:36:13.419 --> 00:36:17.380
process is denaturing the DNA.
You can do that by gently

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:21.145
adding heat and making it basic,
but you make the two DNA

00:36:21.145 --> 00:36:23.986
strands separate.
When they separate,

00:36:23.986 --> 00:36:28.634
the primers that you've added
automatically bind through the

00:36:28.634 --> 00:36:32.387
process of hybridization,
and then you turn up the

00:36:32.387 --> 00:36:36.190
temperature to the optimum for
Taq polymerase and DNA

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:40.355
synthesis starts.
The polymerase starts a process

00:36:40.355 --> 00:36:43.880
of replication of your DNA
sequences.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.180
You first separated your DNA,
let the primers bind,

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:52.911
then turn on the enzyme,
and it makes copies of each one

00:36:52.911 --> 00:36:55.612
of these.
You then denature again,

00:36:55.612 --> 00:36:59.174
each one of these strands gets
separated, primers bind,

00:36:59.174 --> 00:37:02.340
turn on the polymerase,
a new strand is made.

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:06.416
If you repeatedly go through
this cycle of denaturing,

00:37:06.416 --> 00:37:09.801
synthesizing,
denaturing, synthesizing you'll

00:37:09.801 --> 00:37:13.569
get many, many copies of DNA.
The number of copies you get

00:37:13.569 --> 00:37:15.590
depends on how many times you do
the cycling.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:20.212
If you start with only one,
you have two pieces of DNA,

00:37:20.212 --> 00:37:25.604
then you'll get 2 to the N^(th)
fragments after N cycles because

00:37:25.604 --> 00:37:29.199
each cycle you're doubling the
number.

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:32.775
This has turned out to be a
very powerful technique because

00:37:32.775 --> 00:37:36.542
it's relatively rapid.
It's totally synthetic,

00:37:36.542 --> 00:37:42.241
there's no micro-organism
involved in making the DNA for

00:37:42.241 --> 00:37:45.200
you,.
You can do it very rapidly in a

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.949
laboratory, and fairly
expensively now.

00:37:47.949 --> 00:37:51.939
It's really been a powerful
tool in molecular biology

00:37:51.939 --> 00:37:56.235
because I might have a very
small copy of a gene that I'm

00:37:56.235 --> 00:38:00.684
interested in and I can make
enough copies that I can start

00:38:00.684 --> 00:38:05.142
to do something else with it.
You can also use PCR to

00:38:05.142 --> 00:38:10.150
identify specific genes that are
present in a biological sample.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:12.731
You can use PCR for
fingerprinting as well,

00:38:12.731 --> 00:38:15.497
for looking in some unknown
fluid for example,

00:38:15.497 --> 00:38:18.139
is a gene that I'm interested
in there?

00:38:18.139 --> 00:38:22.466
You could use PCR to do that
because if you amplify a gene in

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:26.360
PCR, that gene had to be present
from the beginning.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:35.440
Well let's talk about some
mechanisms for using this and

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:40.555
I'll start with a simple example
of how one can detect a gene in

00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:43.505
a fluid,
in a blood sample for example,

00:38:43.505 --> 00:38:47.019
where that gene is unknown.
This takes advantage of the

00:38:47.019 --> 00:38:50.050
very specific properties of
restriction enzymes.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.298
This particular example
involves the gene for sickle

00:38:53.298 --> 00:38:56.054
cell anemia.
Sickle cell anemia is a disease

00:38:56.054 --> 00:38:58.519
that affects a subset of the
population.

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:04.174
It's a single gene defect and
we know exactly where the

00:39:04.174 --> 00:39:07.840
genetic defect is in sickle
cell.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:12.235
It's on the gene for hemoglobin
and the hemoglobin that you

00:39:12.235 --> 00:39:16.478
produce if you have sickle cell
anemia is not quite right

00:39:16.478 --> 00:39:19.510
because there's one base
difference.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:25.630
If you have normal hemoglobin
you have this sequence here,

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:30.343
CCTGAGGAG.
In sickle hemoglobin you have a

00:39:30.343 --> 00:39:35.260
sequence that's only slightly
different within the gene,

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:38.860
CCTGTGGAG,
so there's a thymine that's

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:43.116
substituted for an alanine and
that results in making

00:39:43.116 --> 00:39:47.780
hemoglobin that's not quite
right that doesn't function in

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:52.199
the same way as the normal
hemoglobin gene does.

00:39:52.199 --> 00:39:56.893
How could I identify in a
chromosomal DNA sample whether

00:39:56.893 --> 00:40:02.149
the sickle gene is present?
Well one way you could do it is

00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:07.764
by saying 'if I have this one
base pair difference then this

00:40:07.764 --> 00:40:13.854
sequence is going to be cut by a
specific restriction enzyme that

00:40:13.854 --> 00:40:17.469
recognizes the sequence
CTGAGGA'.

00:40:17.469 --> 00:40:21.435
That restriction enzyme,
there is a restriction enzyme

00:40:21.435 --> 00:40:26.229
that does that and it's MST-3.
If I took this same restriction

00:40:26.229 --> 00:40:30.408
enzyme and tried to cut the
chromosomal DNA of a sickle

00:40:30.408 --> 00:40:33.558
patient,
it wouldn't cut at that point

00:40:33.558 --> 00:40:36.489
because the wrong sequence is
there.

00:40:36.489 --> 00:40:39.820
Here's - how can I find that,
right?

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:44.060
Here's the difference between
normal hemoglobin and sickle

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:48.449
hemoglobin, I can make - I can
see a chemical difference,

00:40:48.449 --> 00:40:50.119
I can exploit it,
how can I find it?

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:53.275
Well the way to find it is
by using a process called

00:40:53.275 --> 00:40:55.570
electrophoresis and Southern
blotting.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:58.335
Electrophoresis is described in
the chapter here,

00:40:58.335 --> 00:41:01.559
I'll just describe it briefly.
If you have DNA fragments,

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:04.372
so this is DNA that you've cut
up into fragments using

00:41:04.372 --> 00:41:08.461
restriction enzymes for example.
You load them into the top of a

00:41:08.461 --> 00:41:12.852
gel and a gel is - in this case
it's synthetic polymer gel but

00:41:12.852 --> 00:41:17.347
it looks very much like Jell-O.
I'm sure some of you have dealt

00:41:17.347 --> 00:41:21.575
with electrophoresis gels in the
past and it's really just a slab

00:41:21.575 --> 00:41:25.604
of something like Jell-O where
you can put a sample at one end

00:41:25.604 --> 00:41:29.550
of the Jell-O,
your sample of fragmented DNA.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.610
Now you apply electrical charge
across that Jell-O.

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.482
Because it's a gel electricity
is going to move through the gel

00:41:36.482 --> 00:41:40.354
because there are ions in it the
same way - for the same reason

00:41:40.354 --> 00:41:44.039
you don't drop an electrical
device into the bathtub because

00:41:44.039 --> 00:41:47.349
charge moves through water that
has ions in it.

00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:50.168
Charge is going to move
through this gel and DNA is

00:41:50.168 --> 00:41:52.906
charged.
It's loaded with phosphates

00:41:52.906 --> 00:41:56.916
which are negatively charged.
They're going to move from a

00:41:56.916 --> 00:42:00.065
negative pole to a positive
pole, so they're going to move

00:42:00.065 --> 00:42:02.170
through this gel.
Well if you've created

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.626
fragments here and they're
fragments of different size,

00:42:04.626 --> 00:42:07.400
the small ones are going to
move faster than the big ones.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:11.639
So the DNA is going to get
spread out on this gel according

00:42:11.639 --> 00:42:16.025
to size, with the small ones
going farther and the large ones

00:42:16.025 --> 00:42:19.429
not going as far.
If I can run the gel for

00:42:19.429 --> 00:42:22.434
some period of time,
run the electrical field,

00:42:22.434 --> 00:42:26.608
spread it out.
Now if I can stain in some way,

00:42:26.608 --> 00:42:32.391
if I can somehow label the DNA
fragments that I'm interested

00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:34.934
in,
I could find out where those

00:42:34.934 --> 00:42:38.723
fragments are on this gel.
I would be able to predict

00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:43.264
their size, because how far they
moved depended on how big they

00:42:43.264 --> 00:42:47.380
were.
How would I label this DNA?

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:52.546
The best way to label this DNA
is by designing probes or labels

00:42:52.546 --> 00:42:57.546
that hybridize with specific
sequences that you're interested

00:42:57.546 --> 00:43:00.020
in.
This label is DNA that might be

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:03.314
made radioactive or made
fluorescent, and it has a base

00:43:03.314 --> 00:43:06.974
pair sequence that is from some
other region of the gene that

00:43:06.974 --> 00:43:10.768
you're interested in.
It's only going to bind to

00:43:10.768 --> 00:43:14.590
fragments that contain that
piece of the gene,

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:19.602
and it will make those visible
to you in some way so you can

00:43:19.602 --> 00:43:23.591
see where your gene traveled.
Now something similar to

00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:25.125
this is the basis of DNA
fingerprinting,

00:43:25.125 --> 00:43:27.210
that's described in one of the
boxes in your book.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:29.360
In the specific example,
what are we going to do?

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.138
We're going to take a
chromosomal DNA,

00:43:31.138 --> 00:43:33.829
we're going to digest it with
this restriction enzyme,

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:36.598
we're going to put it in this
tube and run it on a gel,

00:43:36.598 --> 00:43:39.059
and we're going to see what
results down here.

00:43:39.059 --> 00:43:42.918
In a normal cell DNA that DNA
in the normal cell - this DNA

00:43:42.918 --> 00:43:45.380
gets cut by the restriction
enzyme,

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:49.240
so the sickle gene ends up - so
that hemoglobin gene ends up in

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:52.459
two pieces.
One that's .2 kilobases long

00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:57.710
and one that's 1.1 kilobases
long - kilobase is 1,000 bases.

00:43:57.710 --> 00:44:01.887
When I look for it here I'm
going to see two pieces,

00:44:01.887 --> 00:44:06.147
one that's nearly the same
length and one that's much

00:44:06.147 --> 00:44:08.684
shorter.
If this was a sickle

00:44:08.684 --> 00:44:12.635
patient, so they had this gene
instead it wouldn't get cut and

00:44:12.635 --> 00:44:16.327
when I went to look for that
presence of that gene on this

00:44:16.327 --> 00:44:19.293
gel,
it would appear as one large

00:44:19.293 --> 00:44:23.550
segment instead of a large one
and a smaller one.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.271
The absence of this smaller
region tells you that this

00:44:27.271 --> 00:44:29.800
sample came from a sickle
patient.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.459
You can imagine other ways of
doing this, or ways of doing

00:44:33.459 --> 00:44:35.769
this same thing in different
ways.

00:44:35.769 --> 00:44:38.544
It takes advantage of the
specificity of the restriction

00:44:38.544 --> 00:44:41.420
enzymes, the fact that we know
what the gene sequence that

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.724
we're looking for,
and using this technological

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:48.877
process of electrophoresis to
identify changes that we

00:44:48.877 --> 00:44:49.740
predict.

00:44:53.909 --> 00:44:57.313
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:44:57.313 --> 00:45:01.088
Mark Saltzman: Yeah,
this is just one particular

00:45:01.088 --> 00:45:04.812
example of how to do it,
but you could - so you have to

00:45:04.812 --> 00:45:08.006
identify something that's unique
about it and then design a

00:45:08.006 --> 00:45:10.429
method for identifying that
unique thing.

00:45:10.429 --> 00:45:15.008
Here the unique thing was that
there's a restriction site

00:45:15.008 --> 00:45:19.995
inside that is present in normal
DNA and not present in sickle

00:45:19.995 --> 00:45:22.283
DNA.
If you could identify some

00:45:22.283 --> 00:45:24.670
other change you could do it as
well.

00:45:28.659 --> 00:45:32.795
Another example of using
this technique is to produce

00:45:32.795 --> 00:45:37.300
therapeutic proteins from cloned
DNA and I'm going to describe

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:39.979
this one.
It'll probably be the last

00:45:39.979 --> 00:45:44.079
example I have time for and so
I'll go through the rest of them

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:47.924
quickly in the next lecture.
But here, for example,

00:45:47.924 --> 00:45:52.491
the idea is to make many copies
of a protein for use as a

00:45:52.491 --> 00:45:55.208
pharmaceutical.
Here's an example where we'd

00:45:55.208 --> 00:45:57.303
like to make insulin,
or having the insulin gene

00:45:57.303 --> 00:45:59.325
would be useful,
but if we could take the

00:45:59.325 --> 00:46:02.018
insulin gene and make many
copies of the insulin protein

00:46:02.018 --> 00:46:03.829
that would be a very useful
thing.

00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:06.732
It turns out that there's lots
of proteins that have value as

00:46:06.732 --> 00:46:09.634
therapeutics and there's a list
of them here and some of them

00:46:09.634 --> 00:46:11.641
you'll recognize.
Erythropoietin,

00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:15.212
commonly called Epo and its
function is to treat anemia

00:46:15.212 --> 00:46:18.320
because it stimulates blood cell
production.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:22.007
You might think that its
function is to make you more - a

00:46:22.007 --> 00:46:25.300
better cyclist but that's not
its only function.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.142
It's used to treat people that
have - you've heard about Epo

00:46:29.142 --> 00:46:30.380
and blood doping,

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.562
but it's a therapeutic protein
as well and very useful for

00:46:39.562 --> 00:46:44.021
patients with anemia.
How do you make many copies of

00:46:44.021 --> 00:46:46.652
cloned DNA?
Well one way is to do just

00:46:46.652 --> 00:46:48.820
exactly what we talked about
before.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.587
Take a plasmid,
cut it open,

00:46:50.587 --> 00:46:54.582
insert a gene that we want into
the plasmid, and then put that

00:46:54.582 --> 00:46:58.380
plasmid in a host cell,
and let the host replicate it.

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.787
Now in this case the host - you
want the host not only to

00:47:01.787 --> 00:47:05.012
replicate all the DNA,
you want it also to express the

00:47:05.012 --> 00:47:07.583
gene.
You're not just trying to clone

00:47:07.583 --> 00:47:11.631
the DNA, you're trying to also
clone or make many copies of the

00:47:11.631 --> 00:47:14.279
protein.
So that's a slightly different

00:47:14.279 --> 00:47:17.437
thing, right?
We want not only for the cell

00:47:17.437 --> 00:47:21.952
to be able to synthesize the
DNA, you want it to be able to

00:47:21.952 --> 00:47:25.300
express the protein off the DNA
as well.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.813
That requires design at a
different level,

00:47:27.813 --> 00:47:31.431
not only does it have to have
an origin of replication which

00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:34.190
works so that you can synthesize
the DNA,

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:37.509
the gene has to be inserted
together with a promoter and

00:47:37.509 --> 00:47:42.030
that promoter is a sequence,
a DNA sequence that the host

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:47.645
will recognize as a signal to
transcribe and translate this

00:47:47.645 --> 00:47:49.823
protein.
We'll talk more about

00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:52.230
promoters as they go on,
for now let's just assume that

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.769
we have a promoter that works in
this particular cell.

00:47:54.769 --> 00:47:59.213
The promoter in this case is
called the lac promoter

00:47:59.213 --> 00:48:04.040
and normally in micro-organisms
that lac promoter is used

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:07.795
to produce a gene called
lacZ which makes a

00:48:07.795 --> 00:48:10.860
protein called
beta-galactosidase.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:14.072
What we're going to do is take
this plasmid,

00:48:14.072 --> 00:48:18.329
with its promoter gene
construct in it and engineer it,

00:48:18.329 --> 00:48:21.576
to take out the lacZ
gene, leaving in the promoter

00:48:21.576 --> 00:48:24.880
and putting in the protein that
we want - the gene for the

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.276
protein that we want.
In this case,

00:48:27.276 --> 00:48:30.697
it says it's GCSF,
but it could also be insulin,

00:48:30.697 --> 00:48:34.403
for example.
Now when we put insulin in

00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:39.368
this place behind the right
promoter, the cell thinks that

00:48:39.368 --> 00:48:44.507
it still has the lacZ
gene present which it needs for

00:48:44.507 --> 00:48:48.644
its metabolism.
So it's going to express this

00:48:48.644 --> 00:48:53.765
gene, but you've put a foreign
gene in the place of the natural

00:48:53.765 --> 00:48:58.389
gene, and so the foreign gene
gets expressed instead.

00:48:58.389 --> 00:49:01.351
In this case,
GCSF, or it could be insulin

00:49:01.351 --> 00:49:05.396
and now if I take this cell and
I grow it under the right

00:49:05.396 --> 00:49:08.891
conditions,
that is, under conditions in

00:49:08.891 --> 00:49:14.059
which the cell would normally
express the lacZ gene,

00:49:14.059 --> 00:49:18.587
it's going to express our gene
instead and presumably,

00:49:18.587 --> 00:49:22.090
hopefully, make large
quantities of it.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:26.649
This was a process that was
perfected on an industrial scale

00:49:26.649 --> 00:49:30.630
by the company Genentech in
California, in the 1970s.

00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:34.673
The first therapeutic protein
that was produced was insulin to

00:49:34.673 --> 00:49:36.293
treat diabetes.
Before that,

00:49:36.293 --> 00:49:38.557
diabetics had been treated with
insulin that came from a

00:49:38.557 --> 00:49:40.990
different source,
usually from pigs,

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:46.179
so by harvesting and purifying
insulin from pig pancreas.

00:49:46.179 --> 00:49:50.936
Now most diabetics take human
insulin made,

00:49:50.936 --> 00:49:55.580
not in humans,
but made in micro-organisms

00:49:55.580 --> 00:50:01.130
that are growing in a
manufacturing facility.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:03.537
That is a way of putting a
cloned gene into a

00:50:03.537 --> 00:50:06.595
micro-organism and than using
that micro-organism as sort of a

00:50:06.595 --> 00:50:09.693
factory for the protein.
You could do the same thing in

00:50:09.693 --> 00:50:12.289
mammals and here's one quick
example of that,

00:50:12.289 --> 00:50:16.796
using a different kind of a
vector, but inserting a gene

00:50:16.796 --> 00:50:19.910
into the fertilized egg of a
mammal,

00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:22.400
in this case, a sheep.
The biology of this is more

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.682
complicated than what I
described before,

00:50:24.682 --> 00:50:28.048
but you can inject this DNA
into a fertilized egg of a sheep

00:50:28.048 --> 00:50:31.643
and then implant that fertilized
egg with the foreign DNA that's

00:50:31.643 --> 00:50:35.340
been micro-injected into it,
into a foster mother.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:40.893
If that leads to the birth of a
young sheep, hopefully that

00:50:40.893 --> 00:50:45.489
sheep has this gene encoded in
its genome now,

00:50:45.489 --> 00:50:48.980
and it will express the protein
that you wanted.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.349
One example of a way people
have used this,

00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:54.491
is that they've taken the gene
that ordinarily produces a milk

00:50:54.491 --> 00:50:57.426
protein.
They put a gene like the

00:50:57.426 --> 00:51:01.385
insulin gene in place of the
milk protein,

00:51:01.385 --> 00:51:07.659
but behind the promoter that is
used to produce milk proteins.

00:51:07.659 --> 00:51:11.438
So this gene is going to be
turned on in the sheep when it

00:51:11.438 --> 00:51:14.820
makes milk, under conditions
where it makes milk.

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.907
If the sheep grows up in the
right way, and people have shown

00:51:17.907 --> 00:51:20.303
that this will work,
you can milk the sheep,

00:51:20.303 --> 00:51:22.940
the sheep has milk,
the milk has insulin in it.

00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:27.677
Here's an example of using a
large animal by inserting the

00:51:27.677 --> 00:51:32.060
gene that you're interested in,
you can make this animal into a

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.289
factory for the kind of protein
that you would like to make.

00:51:35.289 --> 00:51:38.453
I'll finish talking about these
examples at the beginning of

00:51:38.453 --> 00:51:42.210
lecture on Tuesday.
I'll see you this afternoon in

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:43.210
section.

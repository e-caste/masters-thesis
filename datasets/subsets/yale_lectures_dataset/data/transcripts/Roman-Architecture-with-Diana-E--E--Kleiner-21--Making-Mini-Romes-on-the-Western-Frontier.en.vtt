00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:03.100
Prof: Good morning
everybody.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.553
In the last couple of lectures
we have looked at what happened

00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:11.057
when Rome took over
civilizations that were older

00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:14.856
than Rome's own,
and arguably even more advanced

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:16.100
than Rome's own.
 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.150
And what happened,
of course, was an interesting

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.303
mix between the architecture and
the architectural forms that the

00:00:23.303 --> 00:00:26.856
Romans brought with them,
and what they found in these

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:30.860
highly developed civilizations,
and the interesting mix that

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.970
came about because of that.
 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.251
But we've also taken a look at
what happens when Rome went out

00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:40.550
and created cities essentially
from scratch,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.370
built cities where there had
been no cities before.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.631
And what happened as a result
tended to be cities that looked

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.350
very much in the Roman stamp.
 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.970
And we're going to look at a
number of those cities today,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.870
in the western provinces of the
Empire,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.847
in fact, to see what happens
again when Rome builds cities

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:03.780
from scratch in that part of the
world,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.430
and, as I mentioned already,
the distinctive stamp,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.218
this distinctive Roman stamp
that they had.

00:01:09.218 --> 00:01:12.736
But at the same time there is
always some impact from the

00:01:12.736 --> 00:01:15.917
local civilization,
and to mention in passing that,

00:01:15.917 --> 00:01:18.584
at least in the part of the
world that we'll be

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:21.879
concentrating on today,
especially in Gaul,

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:25.888
ancient Gaul,
the Celtic tribes were foremost

00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:28.915
there,
and we do see that some of the

00:01:28.915 --> 00:01:31.950
impact of those tribes makes
itself felt,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.617
as well as tribes in other
parts of this part of the

00:01:35.617 --> 00:01:37.200
ancient Roman world.
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.156
Just as a reminder,
I want to show you again a

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:43.769
couple of the monuments that we
looked at last time,

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:47.117
when we were talking about
Greece and about Athens under

00:01:47.117 --> 00:01:47.910
the Romans.
 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.468
And I remind you,
for example on the left-hand

00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:54.346
side of the screen,
of this Temple of Olympian

00:01:54.346 --> 00:02:00.022
Zeus, the Olympieion in Athens,
which was begun already in the

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:03.353
Archaic period,
the Greek Archaic period,

00:02:03.353 --> 00:02:08.252
continued to be built up--
those, the patrons tried to

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:10.936
complete it,
in the course of the

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:13.848
Hellenistic period into the
Augustan period,

00:02:13.848 --> 00:02:15.330
and ultimately,
as you'll remember,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.889
it was completed under the
emperor Hadrian.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.216
So a building with a very long
history and a very distinctive

00:02:22.216 --> 00:02:22.658
style.
 

00:02:22.658 --> 00:02:24.740
And when it was completed under
Hadrian,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.729
of course, you'll recall that
it looked entirely Greek --

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.383
very similar to what it would
have been in the Hellenistic

00:02:32.383 --> 00:02:33.120
period.
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.812
So those--again,
the Greeks holding very

00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:40.037
tenaciously to their own plans,
to their building materials,

00:02:40.037 --> 00:02:43.925
and indeed to the kinds of
architects and artisans to carve

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:45.949
them,
that had been carving them for

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:46.470
centuries.
 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.913
We also took a look at the
building on the right-hand side

00:02:49.913 --> 00:02:52.330
of the screen,
which is the Horologion of

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.870
Andronicus, or the Tower of the
Winds.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.353
And you'll remember in this
case that the civilization that

00:02:58.353 --> 00:03:01.836
had impact on it was another
firmly entrenched civilization

00:03:01.836 --> 00:03:03.639
and that is that of Egypt.
 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.449
We talked about the fact that
while the date of this monument

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.534
is controversial--
it might be second century

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:14.003
B.C., it might be Caesarian,
or even into the Augustan

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:17.329
period--it's controversial,
but we talked about the fact

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.110
that even though the date is
controversial,

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.370
that the monument itself was
built under very strong

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.479
influence from Ptolemaic Egypt.
 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.090
The Ptolemaic Egyptians
particularly intrigued,

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.526
for example,
by clocks--this was a water

00:03:31.526 --> 00:03:34.018
clock,
as you'll remember--and by

00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:37.617
these abstruse,
identifications of abstruse

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:41.268
winds, male winds,
that we see in the uppermost

00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:41.680
part.
 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.288
So again, the impact of two
very high civilizations--

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:49.610
the Greek civilization and the
Egyptian civilization--

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.970
on Roman architecture in the
eastern part of the world.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.721
Today we're going to go west,
and we're going to look at

00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:59.788
Roman architecture in a variety
of places,

00:03:59.788 --> 00:04:02.240
including--and some beautiful
places--

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.840
including the south of France:
a series of cities--

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.219
and I'll point those out to you
in a moment--

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.500
in the north of Italy.
 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.610
So the north of Italy,
the south of France,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.468
into Spain, into what is now
Spain.

00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:20.050
And then also we will dip into
an area called Istria,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.250
which is the uppermost part of
what is now Croatia,

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.949
where a place by the name of
Pola is located.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:30.728
So those western provinces will
be the area that we're going to

00:04:30.728 --> 00:04:32.129
concentrate on today.
 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.341
Now any of you who've traveled
in this part of the world know

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.430
that it is extraordinarily
beautiful.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.579
And I show you just one example
of that.

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.509
When you go along the French
Riviera,

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.504
for example,
you see places as sophisticated

00:04:45.504 --> 00:04:48.906
as Monte Carlo,
with its yachts moored here,

00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:52.742
and of course with its
glittering nightlife and its

00:04:52.742 --> 00:04:58.310
extremely famous casino,
the Casino at Monte Carlo.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.540
There are also other wonderful
cities to visit along here,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.379
modern cities,
such that of Villefranche,

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.745
which you see here,
and its fabulous pastel colored

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:12.665
houses,
with boats that are not quite

00:05:12.665 --> 00:05:15.560
as magnificent as those at Monte
Carlo,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.560
but nonetheless very
picturesque, a wonderful place

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.220
to visit.
 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.560
So it's not a hardship to have
to travel and look at Roman

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.379
antiquities in the south of
France.

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:29.807
I want to begin though with
northern Italy,

00:05:29.807 --> 00:05:34.543
with a city in the north of
Italy, a city at a place called

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.360
Aosta.
 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.420
It's the first on your Monument
List for today.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.569
A city that was founded by the
Romans in 24 B.C.,

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:45.360
in the time of Augustus.
 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.918
And therefore it won't surprise
you to hear that its ancient

00:05:49.918 --> 00:05:53.858
Roman name was Augusta
Praetoria: Augusta Praetoria,

00:05:53.858 --> 00:05:56.100
the modern city of Aosta.
 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.240
And it was the last colony that
the Romans founded in Italy;

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.430
the last colony.
 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.209
And it's interesting to see
therefore that this last Roman

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:10.055
colony in Italy takes almost
exactly the shape of the first

00:06:10.055 --> 00:06:11.778
Roman colony in Italy.
 

00:06:11.778 --> 00:06:15.194
You'll remember the city of
Ostia, which the Romans founded

00:06:15.194 --> 00:06:18.255
in 350 B.C., and the way in
which it conformed to the

00:06:18.255 --> 00:06:20.139
typical castrum plan.
 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.160
We see the same thing here.
 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.593
We see this typical
castrum plan for Aosta:

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:27.836
a rectangle,
a regular rectangle,

00:06:27.836 --> 00:06:31.410
laid out according to Roman
surveying practice.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:34.779
We see that the two major
streets of the city,

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.509
the cardo and the
decumanus,

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.072
meet in the center,
and that at that intersection

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:43.709
of those two main streets we see
the location,

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:45.718
as it should be,
of the forum,

00:06:45.718 --> 00:06:46.690
most likely.
 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.057
You'll see a question mark
there, so we're not absolutely

00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:51.339
sure, but we think that the
forum was located there.

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:53.889
If you look around at the rest
of the city,

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:57.776
it was very regularly laid out,
with a series of buildings that

00:06:57.776 --> 00:07:01.600
we've become accustomed to
seeing in a typical Roman city,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.970
when a typical Roman city is
built from the basics.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:06.620
You see the baths here.
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.600
You see a temple up there,
with a cryptoporticus.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.810
You see a theater and you see
an amphitheater.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.370
This site, by the way,
spectacularly located in the

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:17.439
Italian Alps.
 

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:21.139
It's at the intersection of two
major trade routes,

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:21.879
in the St.
 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:25.134
Bernard passes,
as you can see from this plan

00:07:25.134 --> 00:07:27.649
that comes from Ward-Perkins.
 

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:31.055
And what you can also see,
that's typical of these cities

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.524
that the Romans build from
scratch around the western part

00:07:34.524 --> 00:07:36.875
of the Empire,
is the fact that the city is

00:07:36.875 --> 00:07:39.605
ringed with walls,
and that it has a series of

00:07:39.605 --> 00:07:43.913
gates, the openings of which you
can also see in this excellent

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:44.470
plan.
 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.394
Now I can show you also from
the city of Aosta a surviving

00:07:50.394 --> 00:07:54.060
Roman arch,
one of those gateways in fact,

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.980
from the city,
that we know dates to the age

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:57.759
of Augustus.
 

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:59.920
So we give it a date,
the same date,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:00.970
roughly 24 B.C.
 

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.949
You see it here.
 

00:08:02.949 --> 00:08:06.398
You see, if you remember the
arches that we've discussed from

00:08:06.398 --> 00:08:11.019
the Augustan period in the past,
you'll note right off that this

00:08:11.019 --> 00:08:15.399
is very consistent with other
Augustan arch design.

00:08:15.399 --> 00:08:19.449
By that I mean it has one
single arcuated bay,

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:22.045
in the center,
flanked on either side by

00:08:22.045 --> 00:08:25.553
pedestals,
wide pedestals that have a set

00:08:25.553 --> 00:08:28.639
of double columns on either
side,

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.879
as you can see here.
 

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:33.360
The major difference between
this and an arch that might have

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.678
been put up in Rome at the same
time,

00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:39.205
in the Augustan period,
is the fact that it is made out

00:08:39.205 --> 00:08:42.182
of local stone,
which is characteristic of so

00:08:42.182 --> 00:08:44.668
much of provincial Roman
architecture,

00:08:44.668 --> 00:08:48.461
and will be the case for most
of the buildings that we look at

00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:48.960
today.
 

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.950
The attic is gone.
 

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.259
There's a modern roof on top of
the structure.

00:08:53.259 --> 00:08:55.000
The ancient attic is gone.
 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.482
But you can imagine that it
would've had a fairly

00:08:57.482 --> 00:09:00.991
traditional attic,
with an inscription at the apex

00:09:00.991 --> 00:09:05.369
and probably some kind of
sculpture crowning the monument

00:09:05.369 --> 00:09:06.620
in antiquity.
 

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.644
Now there's one detail that has
to do with the orders that are

00:09:10.644 --> 00:09:14.734
used here that is different from
any other arch that we've seen

00:09:14.734 --> 00:09:15.460
before.
 

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.149
And I wonder if any of you
notice what that is.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:25.659
The columnar orders.
 

00:09:25.659 --> 00:09:28.049
They are what?
 

00:09:28.049 --> 00:09:30.419
Doric, Ionic or Corinthian?
 

00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:30.940
Students:  Corinthian.
 

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.200
Prof: Corinthian.
 

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.139
Okay, everyone agrees they're
Corinthian.

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:34.120
You're absolutely correct.
 

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.942
But what is strange about the
fact--if you look above those

00:09:37.942 --> 00:09:41.038
Corinthian columns,
what do you see that doesn't

00:09:41.038 --> 00:09:43.610
usually go with Corinthian
columns?

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.570
Student:  Oh,
the triglyphs.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.798
Prof: The triglyphs and
the metopes;

00:09:47.798 --> 00:09:50.831
the triglyphs and the metopes
that tend to accompany the Doric

00:09:50.831 --> 00:09:51.230
order.
 

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.629
So this is very interesting.
 

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:56.322
We see this mixing of the
orders here, the use of

00:09:56.322 --> 00:10:00.556
Corinthian columns but a Doric
frieze with triglyphs and

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:01.480
metopes.
 

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.200
You'd never see that in Rome
itself.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.219
But what it is,
is an interesting playing

00:10:07.219 --> 00:10:11.975
around with the canonical orders
that have been passed from Rome

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:14.240
to this part of the world.
 

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.178
This particular architect or
patron,

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:18.575
or the city itself,
whoever was the patron of this

00:10:18.575 --> 00:10:21.364
particular monument,
made the decision to go in a

00:10:21.364 --> 00:10:22.908
somewhat different route.
 

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:24.750
So an interesting mixing of the
orders --

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:28.668
an eccentric arch in that
regard, but in every other

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:33.048
conforming quite closely to what
we would see in Rome,

00:10:33.048 --> 00:10:35.720
the city of Rome
contemporaneously.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.840
I want to go from Aosta,
in the north of Italy,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.668
to the south of France,
to Provence,

00:10:43.668 --> 00:10:49.220
to take a look at the original
town plan of the city of Arles,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.740
the well-known city of Arles.
 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:53.456
And those of you who know it,
or have been there,

00:10:53.456 --> 00:10:56.908
know it probably primarily as
the city of Vincent van Gogh.

00:10:56.908 --> 00:11:00.210
It's in the city of Arles he
spent a good deal of time.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.480
He went to this particular
café so often that it has

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.721
borne his name for some time,
the Café

00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:08.678
Van Gogh.
 

00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:13.437
And you see another view of a
lovely piazza in the city of--or

00:11:13.437 --> 00:11:15.700
plaza in the city of Arles.
 

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.500
And then the famous painting of
Van Gogh,

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.570
the panting that he made of
this particular café,

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.558
that he used to spend so much
time in,

00:11:23.558 --> 00:11:25.860
a café
again, as you see here,

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.844
that is still there,
and where you can yourselves go

00:11:29.844 --> 00:11:32.500
and sip an aperitif or whatever.
 

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.980
This part, the city of Arles,
a wonderful place to go.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.288
It has a very--I'm not going to
show it to you in any detail,

00:11:40.288 --> 00:11:42.990
just a glimpse here of its
famous amphitheater.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:45.710
It has a very well-preserved
Roman amphitheater.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.058
And the fact that France is so
close--

00:11:48.058 --> 00:11:50.320
as you can see in that map I
showed you before--

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.745
to Spain, has led to quite a
bit of Spanish influence coming

00:11:55.745 --> 00:11:59.240
into this particular part of
France.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.125
And this amphitheater is used
today not only for other kinds

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:05.760
of performances,
but even for bullfights,

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.750
as you see.
 

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.168
This is actually a bullfight in
Madrid,

00:12:08.168 --> 00:12:11.719
not in Arles,
but nonetheless it's the sort

00:12:11.719 --> 00:12:16.703
of thing that has been performed
even in the Amphitheater at

00:12:16.703 --> 00:12:17.549
Arles.
 

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.240
Here's the map again.
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.870
Before I show you the city plan
of Arles as it would've looked,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.383
I just wanted to remind you of
these towns in relationship to

00:12:26.383 --> 00:12:27.320
one another.
 

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.120
So we've come up from Rome.
 

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.653
We've looked at Aosta in the
north of Italy,

00:12:31.653 --> 00:12:32.480
in the Alps.
 

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.960
We're making our way now into
the south of France.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.524
And I wanted to point out the
proximity of northern Italy with

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:40.808
the south of France.
 

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:44.711
Because we do believe that a
lot of the impact of Rome was

00:12:44.711 --> 00:12:46.945
felt through the--
on south of France,

00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:48.629
or what is now the south of
France--

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:54.413
was passed through the
intermediary of the north of

00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:56.873
Italy;
that there were certain kinds

00:12:56.873 --> 00:13:00.202
of architectural forms that were
developed in the north of Italy

00:13:00.202 --> 00:13:02.899
that were transferred into the
south of France,

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:05.740
because of the proximity of one
to the other.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:07.850
We're going to be looking at
Arles.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.220
We're going to be looking at
Nîmes.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.320
We're going to look at a
building in La Turbie.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.470
We'll be looking at
Saint-Rémy,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.910
and at Orange,
the great theater at Orange,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.340
as well as a temple at Vienne
-- so all of those sites.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.418
We're going to dip into Spain.
 

00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:24.196
We're going to look at a
famous, famous,

00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:28.039
spectacular aqueduct at
Segovia, and a less spectacular

00:13:28.039 --> 00:13:31.600
but very well-preserved aqueduct
at Tarragona.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.480
And then we're also going to
make our way,

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.370
as I mentioned before,
into Istria,

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.490
part of what was formerly
Yugoslavia,

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:42.409
to the site called Pola,
that is now in,

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:46.129
as you know, Croatia.
 

00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:49.154
I want to begin with the city
plan of Arles,

00:13:49.154 --> 00:13:52.038
as it would've looked in
ancient times.

00:13:52.038 --> 00:13:56.399
And I show you here the city
plan of--

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:59.668
excuse me, not the city plan,
I want to show you the forum,

00:13:59.668 --> 00:14:03.498
to give you a sense of what
fora looked like in the western

00:14:03.498 --> 00:14:06.668
provinces during this period,
especially in Gaul.

00:14:06.668 --> 00:14:10.460
I want to show you the forum
plan of the city of Arles.

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.519
And I show it to you here,
with the modern streets

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.269
superimposed on top of it.
 

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:17.330
Because much of it is
underground;

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:19.600
you can't see too much of it
today.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.499
But it has been explored
underground enough where

00:14:22.499 --> 00:14:26.109
scholars have been able--
archaeologists have been able

00:14:26.109 --> 00:14:30.136
to reconstruct the fact that it
was a large open rectangular

00:14:30.136 --> 00:14:32.464
space,
surrounded by columns,

00:14:32.464 --> 00:14:35.828
as we have seen is
characteristic of all Roman

00:14:35.828 --> 00:14:39.086
forum design,
from the Forum in Pompeii that

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:42.600
we looked at at the very
beginning of this semester.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.917
And although you can't see it
on this particular plan,

00:14:45.917 --> 00:14:49.798
there was also a temple on one
short end, as well as a basilica

00:14:49.798 --> 00:14:51.740
that was part of this plan.
 

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.529
And I think it's interesting to
think back,

00:14:53.529 --> 00:14:57.250
especially as you review from
what we've done from the midterm

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:01.033
through the second midterm,
it's interesting to think about

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:04.525
basilican architecture,
because it was usually a part

00:15:04.525 --> 00:15:07.130
of forums,
and when it was a part of--and

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:09.643
in what buildings,
in what fora it was

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:12.250
incorporated:
think back to Pompeii,

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:15.298
think to the Forum of Trajan in
Rome.

00:15:15.298 --> 00:15:18.889
But think of the fact that both
the Forums of Julius Caesar and

00:15:18.889 --> 00:15:22.304
the Forum of Augustus in Rome
did not have basilicas as part

00:15:22.304 --> 00:15:23.000
of them.
 

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.990
Here already in the Augustan
period in--

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:29.690
because that's when this
dates--in the Augustan period we

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.059
see a basilica incorporated into
the forum plan,

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:35.370
in what was ancient Gaul.
 

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.346
I mentioned that there's a
well-preserved--there's a

00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:40.447
well-preserved
cryptoporticus,

00:15:40.447 --> 00:15:43.600
an underground storage area,
around the colonnade.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.649
And you see a view of it here:
extremely well preserved.

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:49.580
And it should remind you of
those cryptoportici that

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.711
we looked at very early in the
semester at the sanctuaries that

00:15:52.711 --> 00:15:56.638
we explored: the sanctuaries,
you know, at Tivoli and

00:15:56.638 --> 00:16:00.320
Hercules Victor;
Hercules Victor at Tivoli and

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.220
Jupiter Anxur at Terracina,
for example;

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.950
very similar with its
barrel-vaulted corridors.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.220
This one was used for storage
within the forum.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.423
So they would store salt and
fuel and other items that they

00:16:13.423 --> 00:16:15.379
would need for daily use.
 

00:16:15.379 --> 00:16:18.168
But it also became
eventually--and you can get an

00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:20.840
inkling of that from this view
on the left--

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.673
it eventually became a dump for
architectural members that were

00:16:24.673 --> 00:16:26.802
no longer needed--
as you can see here,

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:29.190
columns and capitals--
but also for sculpture.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.538
And one of the most famous
portraits of the emperor

00:16:32.538 --> 00:16:36.019
Augustus was found in this
cryptoporticus,

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:40.538
dumped there at some later
period, and it's now on display

00:16:40.538 --> 00:16:43.710
in the Archaeological Museum in
Arles.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.636
I want to turn now to the
Theater at Orange,

00:16:46.636 --> 00:16:50.312
which is one of the most
spectacular monuments that I'm

00:16:50.312 --> 00:16:52.220
going to show you today.
 

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:56.370
And you see it in this
extraordinary view from the air;

00:16:56.370 --> 00:17:00.606
a building that you can see
from your Monument List was put

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:03.308
up in the late first century
B.C.,

00:17:03.308 --> 00:17:06.172
early first century A.D.,
and it is really something

00:17:06.172 --> 00:17:08.637
special,
not only in its own right,

00:17:08.637 --> 00:17:11.910
but also because of how well
preserved it is.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:17.356
And you can see in this view
not only the typical scheme that

00:17:17.356 --> 00:17:20.576
we have seen,
we've become accustomed to,

00:17:20.576 --> 00:17:24.109
for Roman theater design:
the semicircular orchestra;

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:27.566
the semicircular cavea;
the division into these

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:30.190
wedge-shaped sections or
cunei;

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:33.880
the outer wall of the structure.
 

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.218
And you should be immediately
struck by this outer wall of the

00:17:37.218 --> 00:17:39.449
structure,
because the outer wall of the

00:17:39.449 --> 00:17:42.540
structure is better preserved
than any other outer wall that

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.900
we've seen in the course of this
semester.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.108
It's preserved to its full
height.

00:17:47.108 --> 00:17:50.589
It is very severe,
but that severity would have

00:17:50.589 --> 00:17:55.207
been lessened in antiquity by
the incorporation of a colonnade

00:17:55.207 --> 00:17:57.779
on the front of the structure.
 

00:17:57.779 --> 00:18:01.940
So this very important
building, in that regard,

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:04.880
because we again have this very
well-preserved wall,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.768
which gives us a good sense of
what these walls would've looked

00:18:07.768 --> 00:18:08.700
like in antiquity.
 

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:14.909
And you have to imagine here
again that alleviation of this

00:18:14.909 --> 00:18:17.798
severity by that portico.
 

00:18:17.798 --> 00:18:22.037
You can also see here though
something very interesting about

00:18:22.037 --> 00:18:25.640
this particular theater that
makes it connected--

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.948
although it's Roman in every
way--that connects it also to

00:18:28.948 --> 00:18:31.269
earlier Greek theatrical
architecture.

00:18:31.269 --> 00:18:34.671
Because you'll remember that
the major difference between

00:18:34.671 --> 00:18:37.951
Roman theaters and Greek
theaters was that Romans built

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:40.259
their theaters on their own
hill,

00:18:40.259 --> 00:18:43.075
made of concrete,
but the Greeks built their

00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:45.630
theaters on actual natural
hillsides.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.992
And if you look very carefully
at this excellent view from the

00:18:48.992 --> 00:18:50.998
air,
you will see the way in which

00:18:50.998 --> 00:18:54.384
this particular theater,
at Orange, is actually built

00:18:54.384 --> 00:18:55.558
into a hillside.
 

00:18:55.558 --> 00:18:59.321
They happened to have a natural
hillside perfect for this kind

00:18:59.321 --> 00:19:02.097
of construction,
right where they wanted it to

00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:02.528
be.
 

00:19:02.528 --> 00:19:06.338
So they took advantage of that
hillside and they placed--

00:19:06.338 --> 00:19:10.054
they supported the cavea
of this structure by that

00:19:10.054 --> 00:19:13.460
hillside,
as you can see extremely well.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:18.006
The interior of the Theater at
Orange is also extremely well

00:19:18.006 --> 00:19:20.549
preserved, as you can see here.
 

00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:24.220
You can see the stage.
 

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.288
You can see the semicircular
orchestra.

00:19:27.288 --> 00:19:30.618
You can see the stone seats of
the cavea,

00:19:30.618 --> 00:19:33.779
and you can also see that the
stage building--

00:19:33.779 --> 00:19:36.539
and because the wall,
the outside retaining wall is

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:39.568
so well preserved,
you can also see that the

00:19:39.568 --> 00:19:43.009
interior of the wall still
stands, obviously.

00:19:43.009 --> 00:19:46.420
And this wall had one giant
niche in the center,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.250
with a projecting element also
in the center,

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.309
and then would've had three
tiers of columns,

00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:55.240
one on top of one another.
 

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.808
Most of those are unfortunately
no longer there,

00:19:57.808 --> 00:20:01.009
but you can see one set of two
pairs here--

00:20:01.009 --> 00:20:04.871
the lowest tier with two
columns, the upper tier with two

00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:09.671
partial columns above that--
which gives you some sense of

00:20:09.671 --> 00:20:13.910
what this would've looked like
in antiquity.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.607
Again we think the tiers,
the columns,

00:20:15.607 --> 00:20:16.710
were on three stories.
 

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:19.976
Remember the date of this,
late-first century B.C.

00:20:19.976 --> 00:20:20.710
probably.
 

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:25.787
And so this does post-date some
of the 60 to 50 to 40 B.C.

00:20:25.787 --> 00:20:30.329
paintings that we looked at
that show these kinds of

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.981
multi-storied,
scaenae frontes with

00:20:33.981 --> 00:20:35.230
columns.
 

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:38.869
We speculated about the fact
that some of those may have been

00:20:38.869 --> 00:20:41.480
based on actual theatrical
architecture,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.700
but that it didn't survive from
that early on,

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.130
but it may have been made out
of wood.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:51.088
But here we see a fairly early
example, in the Augustan period,

00:20:51.088 --> 00:20:55.088
in the south of France,
and it is very important in

00:20:55.088 --> 00:20:56.368
that regard.
 

00:20:56.368 --> 00:21:00.895
I want to turn from theater
architecture in the western

00:21:00.895 --> 00:21:03.828
provinces to temple
architecture.

00:21:03.828 --> 00:21:06.922
And just as in Rome,
and just as in every city that

00:21:06.922 --> 00:21:09.335
we've looked at,
temple architecture was

00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:10.818
extremely important.
 

00:21:10.818 --> 00:21:12.828
The temples that I'm going to
show you--

00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:14.269
and I'm going to show you two
of them,

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:17.441
one at Vienne,
in France, and one at

00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.869
Nîmes,
also in France--are among our

00:21:20.869 --> 00:21:23.440
best preserved Roman temples
today.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.551
And it's important to keep in
mind that both of them were part

00:21:28.551 --> 00:21:29.808
of complexes.
 

00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:34.481
They stand in isolation today,
but in antiquity they were part

00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:39.000
of a complex -- probably some
kind of forum or central space

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.380
for that city.
 

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:46.614
This is the one at Vienne,
which I show to you first,

00:21:46.614 --> 00:21:51.049
that dates to,
probably to before A.D.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.890
14.
 

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:56.588
And it is a temple that was put
up to Augustus and Roma.

00:21:56.588 --> 00:22:00.121
It may have been--the
dedication may have been changed

00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:03.319
to Augustus and his wife Livia,
at some point;

00:22:03.319 --> 00:22:04.630
we're not absolutely sure.
 

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:07.951
But you see it here in a very
good general view of what it

00:22:07.951 --> 00:22:09.058
looks like today.
 

00:22:09.058 --> 00:22:13.152
It's one of these buildings
that has been preserved in large

00:22:13.152 --> 00:22:16.759
part because it has been
used--for later purposes.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:20.440
It was used as a marketplace.
 

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.778
It was used as a museum at one
point.

00:22:22.778 --> 00:22:25.098
And that is what has helped to
preserve it.

00:22:25.098 --> 00:22:27.880
We see it again here,
and it's interesting,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.951
I think, to compare it to the
restored view of the Temple of

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:36.160
Mars Ultor that was part of the
Forum of Augustus in Rome,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.358
because the dates are roughly
comparable to one another.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:42.722
And I think that you will see
that it is a typical Roman

00:22:42.722 --> 00:22:45.474
temple, in fact,
almost indistinguishable from

00:22:45.474 --> 00:22:48.348
what we would see in Rome at the
same time.

00:22:48.348 --> 00:22:51.900
So here's an example again of
what happens when you go--

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:55.057
when the Romans go into a part
of the world that isn't already

00:22:55.057 --> 00:22:57.798
inhabited by a very highly
developed civilization,

00:22:57.798 --> 00:23:01.400
that they make buildings that
look very similar to those that

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:03.798
were put up contemporaneously in
Rome.

00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:06.390
The Temple at Vienne is no
exception.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:10.330
If we look at this temple,
we see it has the typical

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.426
Greco-Roman plan with the tall
podium, the deep porch,

00:23:14.426 --> 00:23:17.750
the freestanding columns in
that porch.

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:21.578
And we see that the order that
is used here is the Corinthian

00:23:21.578 --> 00:23:22.088
order.
 

00:23:22.088 --> 00:23:25.200
Some of the temple is made out
of local limestone.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.700
Some of it is made out of
marble.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:30.095
But what we see here that's
very interesting

00:23:30.095 --> 00:23:33.104
vis-à-vis what was
happening at the same time in

00:23:33.104 --> 00:23:34.328
Rome is the cella.
 

00:23:34.328 --> 00:23:37.772
You can see that the cella is
actually very shallow,

00:23:37.772 --> 00:23:40.880
much more shallow than the
cella usually is;

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.160
and you can see that quite well
in this view over here.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:49.472
And that same shallow cella we
find at the Temple of Mars Ultor

00:23:49.472 --> 00:23:50.328
in Rome.
 

00:23:50.328 --> 00:23:53.859
The other similarity is the
fact that at the Temple of Mars

00:23:53.859 --> 00:23:56.660
Ultor in Rome we have
freestanding columns--

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.769
columns all the way up to the
back here--

00:24:00.769 --> 00:24:05.347
and those columns--and there's
space between those columns and

00:24:05.347 --> 00:24:07.150
the wall of the cella.
 

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:11.295
And that creates a type of
temple design that we refer to

00:24:11.295 --> 00:24:14.700
today as a temple with
alae or wings;

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.481
wings one on either side of the
cella, formed by that space

00:24:18.481 --> 00:24:22.460
between the wall of the cella
and the freestanding columns.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.509
And we see exactly the same
thing over here,

00:24:25.509 --> 00:24:28.558
this design of a temple with
alae.

00:24:28.558 --> 00:24:33.330
There is no question that this
temple in Vienne was built under

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:38.410
the very strong influence of the
Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome --

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:41.650
all of those features--I mean,
they wouldn't have come upon

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.112
those features by accident;
it is clearly being closely

00:24:45.112 --> 00:24:46.750
based one on the other.
 

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.430
Here are two more views of the
Temple of Augustus and

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.073
Roma/Livia at Vienne,
where we see all of the

00:24:55.073 --> 00:24:57.588
features that I've already shown
you,

00:24:57.588 --> 00:24:59.920
but where you can see
particularly well the shallow

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.116
cella,
the plain--the back wall here

00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:04.568
that has pilasters rather than
columns.

00:25:04.568 --> 00:25:09.508
And then if you go around the
back you will see it has a plain

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:14.041
flat back, which was the case
also for the Temple of Mars

00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:15.500
Ultor in Rome.
 

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:19.068
A more famous temple,
an even more famous temple,

00:25:19.068 --> 00:25:22.104
if that's possible,
an even better preserved

00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:24.359
temple,
is the one that you now see on

00:25:24.359 --> 00:25:26.170
the left-hand side of the
screen,

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.278
which is the famous Maison
Carrée at Nîmes.

00:25:29.278 --> 00:25:33.721
It too, it too has been reused
in ancient times as a museum and

00:25:33.721 --> 00:25:34.509
the like.
 

00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:37.703
It's still a small museum
today, which is one of the main

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.930
reasons that it is so well
preserved.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:43.509
It is an extraordinary work of
Roman architecture.

00:25:43.509 --> 00:25:47.050
I think it's interesting to
compare it to the Temple of

00:25:47.050 --> 00:25:50.328
Portunus that we saw much
earlier this semester.

00:25:50.328 --> 00:25:53.093
The major difference,
of course, between the two,

00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:54.818
the materials that are used.
 

00:25:54.818 --> 00:25:57.430
This is local limestone with
marble.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:26:00.819
This--well we won't remind
ourselves, but tufa and

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:04.348
travertine and so on and so
forth, that we looked at

00:26:04.348 --> 00:26:06.910
earlier--this is an Ionic
temple;

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.000
this is a Corinthian temple.
 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.161
But once again it seems to be
the Temple of Mars Ultor that

00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:16.963
was the main model for the
Maison Carrée or the

00:26:16.963 --> 00:26:19.259
Square House at Nîmes.
 

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:21.730
And I show you another view of
it here.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.222
Because you'll see,
just like the Temple of

00:26:24.222 --> 00:26:26.953
Portunus, it has a
pseudo-peripteral colonnade,

00:26:26.953 --> 00:26:29.328
and you can see that extremely
well.

00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:32.519
Yes, the columns encircle the
entire monument,

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:36.795
including the back wall,
but those columns are engaged

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:40.910
or attached to the wall going
all the way around.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.579
Here you can again see the
opus quadratum blocks of

00:26:44.579 --> 00:26:47.798
this local limestone that's used
for the walls,

00:26:47.798 --> 00:26:51.717
and then marble used for the
columns and also for the

00:26:51.717 --> 00:26:55.861
capitals of this glorious and
very well- preserved Roman

00:26:55.861 --> 00:26:56.690
temple.
 

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.820
And here some spectacular
details of the capitals of the

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.460
Maison Carrée at
Nîmes,

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.906
and the frieze,
and also the decoration up

00:27:08.906 --> 00:27:09.578
above.
 

00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:11.650
And what's interesting about
these capitals,

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.265
if you look at them in detail
you will see that not only are

00:27:15.265 --> 00:27:18.575
they Corinthian,
and we can see the spiral

00:27:18.575 --> 00:27:23.380
volutes growing out of the
acanthus leaves down below,

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.308
but if you compare these
capitals to a capital,

00:27:27.308 --> 00:27:32.328
a preserved capital from the
Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome,

00:27:32.328 --> 00:27:36.019
you will see that not only are
these based on these,

00:27:36.019 --> 00:27:39.279
but that they are so close,
so close,

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:41.500
that there is absolutely no
question,

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:45.257
I believe--well this was not
suggested by me but by a scholar

00:27:45.257 --> 00:27:48.450
who studied these in great
detail and determined and

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:50.763
suggested,
and all of us have believed it

00:27:50.763 --> 00:27:53.121
ever since--
that these are not only based

00:27:53.121 --> 00:27:56.077
on those,
but that the same workshop

00:27:56.077 --> 00:28:01.355
worked these capitals for the
Maison Carrée as for the

00:28:01.355 --> 00:28:04.170
Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome.
 

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.148
Now that works well
chronologically,

00:28:06.148 --> 00:28:09.541
because you'll remember that
the Temple of Mars Ultor in Rome

00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:11.068
was dedicated in 2 B.C.
 

00:28:11.068 --> 00:28:13.529
This building,
as you can see from your

00:28:13.529 --> 00:28:15.990
Monument List,
was built in around A.D.

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:16.380
5.
 

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.278
So there was perfect--it was
perfect timing for those

00:28:20.278 --> 00:28:25.000
architects and artisans who had
been successful at the Temple of

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.951
Mars Ultor in Rome,
this major commission,

00:28:27.951 --> 00:28:31.203
allowed themselves,
we believe, to be hired out to

00:28:31.203 --> 00:28:35.872
those in the south of France,
to make the trip to Nîmes

00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:40.598
in order to build a temple in
the model of the Temple of Mars

00:28:40.598 --> 00:28:43.200
Ultor in Rome,
at Nîmes;

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.098
the result, the Maison
Carrée.

00:28:46.098 --> 00:28:49.798
So this is--I've made this
point in other lectures about

00:28:49.798 --> 00:28:53.901
the fact that there are certain
times when we can document not

00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:57.397
only the exchange of
architectural ideas but even the

00:28:57.397 --> 00:29:00.288
exchange of architects and
artisans,

00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:03.069
going from one part of the
Roman world to another,

00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:04.880
in search of commissions.
 

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:08.424
And this is one of those times
where we can document with

00:29:08.424 --> 00:29:12.096
certainty that artists working
in the employ of the emperor

00:29:12.096 --> 00:29:15.250
himself,
Augustus, made their way to the

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.759
south of France to create this
amazing temple from scratch.

00:29:19.759 --> 00:29:23.826
Once again, a temple very much
in the model of the most famous

00:29:23.826 --> 00:29:28.127
temple of its day in Rome,
and that is the Temple of Mars

00:29:28.127 --> 00:29:30.880
Ultor,
in the Forum of Augustus.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.920
One more detail.
 

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:35.768
Here's the Mars Ultor capital
again, and over here the

00:29:35.768 --> 00:29:38.598
capitals of the Maison
Carrée.

00:29:38.598 --> 00:29:41.891
And I show you above the
frieze, which is extremely well

00:29:41.891 --> 00:29:44.314
preserved,
and you see this flowering

00:29:44.314 --> 00:29:47.134
acanthus plant,
that should immediately remind

00:29:47.134 --> 00:29:49.460
you of contemporary decoration
in Rome;

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:53.497
think of the flowering acanthus
plants of the Ara Pacis

00:29:53.497 --> 00:29:54.318
Augustae.
 

00:29:54.318 --> 00:29:58.097
So once again proof that there
is a very close connection to

00:29:58.097 --> 00:30:01.684
what's going on in Rome at this
time, and in the south of

00:30:01.684 --> 00:30:02.390
France.
 

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:07.730
Here's another spectacular view
of the Maison Carrée,

00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:10.990
as it looks in its location
today.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.284
In the center of a plaza,
surrounded by the daily life of

00:30:15.284 --> 00:30:19.885
Nîmes, as you can see so
well here -- still very much a

00:30:19.885 --> 00:30:21.650
part of daily life.
 

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.788
And very interesting is the
fact that if you look across the

00:30:24.788 --> 00:30:27.098
street,
from the Maison Carrée,

00:30:27.098 --> 00:30:30.997
you see a building that was
designed by the very famous and

00:30:30.997 --> 00:30:34.288
very talented British architect,
Norman Foster.

00:30:34.288 --> 00:30:37.832
It's also a museum,
and it's a play on the name of

00:30:37.832 --> 00:30:41.736
the Maison Carrée,
it's called the Carrée

00:30:41.736 --> 00:30:42.460
d'Art.
 

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:47.273
It's a museum that has modern
art, and it mostly exhibits its

00:30:47.273 --> 00:30:49.200
permanent collections.
 

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.298
But you can see--and I'm going
to show you a detail in a moment

00:30:52.298 --> 00:30:55.307
to bring this point home--
you can see that Norman Foster

00:30:55.307 --> 00:30:57.280
has really looked at,
and studied,

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.835
the Maison Carrée,
and has created a modern

00:31:00.835 --> 00:31:05.548
version, a very modern version
of the Maison Carrée.

00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:09.420
If you look at the Maison
Carrée and its deep porch

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.680
and its high podium and its
single staircase,

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.006
this façade orientation,
all the usual Roman elements,

00:31:16.006 --> 00:31:19.798
and look at this building,
you will see that he too has

00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:22.308
created a kind of portico in the
front.

00:31:22.308 --> 00:31:25.730
They're not actual columns,
they're piers,

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.710
but piers--and very slender and
elegant piers--

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:32.335
but piers nonetheless that are
clearly being played off the

00:31:32.335 --> 00:31:34.710
columns of the Maison
Carrée.

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:39.650
And look at the way in which he
has done the glass exterior.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:44.240
He has divided it into a series
of panels that are clearly,

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.544
I believe, reflecting--and I'm
sure he knew he was doing this

00:31:47.544 --> 00:31:50.739
at the time--
clearly reflecting the panels

00:31:50.739 --> 00:31:55.151
of the ashlar masonry of the
walls of the actual Maison

00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:56.539
Carrée.
 

00:31:56.539 --> 00:31:58.170
So this is very interesting.
 

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:00.058
We see not only dialogue
happening,

00:32:00.058 --> 00:32:02.720
you know, within Roman
buildings themselves,

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.838
in Rome itself and in various
parts of the world,

00:32:05.838 --> 00:32:09.746
but this ongoing dialogue
between ancient monuments and

00:32:09.746 --> 00:32:12.640
modern buildings in cities like
Rome--

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.700
the Ara Pacis in the Meier
building is one example--

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.650
but also in some of these other
cities,

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.568
like Nîmes in the south
of France.

00:32:21.568 --> 00:32:24.092
And, by the way,
you can go up -- there's a roof

00:32:24.092 --> 00:32:26.890
garden that you can go up to,
on the top of this,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.832
of the Carrée d'Art,
in order to see a spectacular

00:32:30.832 --> 00:32:34.390
view from above of the Maison
Carrée.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:39.176
Now one of the most important
elements of the Romanization of

00:32:39.176 --> 00:32:43.884
the Empire was the fact that as
the Romans went in and built

00:32:43.884 --> 00:32:47.256
these new cities,
in East and also in West,

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:51.068
they supplied it with amenities
that weren't there before.

00:32:51.068 --> 00:32:53.683
And this was especially
important in the western

00:32:53.683 --> 00:32:56.686
provinces where again the
civilization had not been all

00:32:56.686 --> 00:32:58.690
that high, prior to this period.
 

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.747
So the Romans come in and they
build aqueducts with a vengeance

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:06.393
in the western provinces,
in the south of France,

00:33:06.393 --> 00:33:11.358
in Spain, in order to provide
these towns with a water supply.

00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:15.356
And I want to show you a couple
of examples of our best

00:33:15.356 --> 00:33:19.946
preserved and most spectacular
Roman aqueducts anywhere in what

00:33:19.946 --> 00:33:22.390
was the ancient Roman Empire.
 

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:26.055
I want to begin with perhaps
the--with certainly the most

00:33:26.055 --> 00:33:28.868
famous of these,
the so-called Pont du Gard,

00:33:28.868 --> 00:33:30.440
also at Nîmes.
 

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:34.625
And I show you first a map,
which gives you a sense of what

00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:36.068
was going on here.
 

00:33:36.068 --> 00:33:38.678
The patron, by the way,
of the Pont du Gard at

00:33:38.678 --> 00:33:41.345
Nîmes was none other than
Marcus Agrippa:

00:33:41.345 --> 00:33:44.592
Marcus Agrippa whom we've
talked about several times this

00:33:44.592 --> 00:33:46.656
semester,
the close friend,

00:33:46.656 --> 00:33:51.364
confidant, right-hand man,
son-in-law, hoped-for heir of

00:33:51.364 --> 00:33:53.840
Augustus,
who we saw was building

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.000
buildings in Rome.
 

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.838
He built the baths that bear
his name,

00:33:57.838 --> 00:34:01.068
the Baths of Agrippa,
and he also built that first

00:34:01.068 --> 00:34:03.900
Pantheon,
that first temple to all the

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.160
gods, with its caryatid porch.
 

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.630
We saw that he was active as a
builder in Athens,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:12.239
where he built the Odeon of
Agrippa,

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:16.597
and where he was honored with a
statue on top of a pier on the

00:34:16.597 --> 00:34:18.170
Acropolis in Athens.
 

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:22.230
He also was active in the south
of France as a great builder,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.155
and it was here that he was
responsible for commissioning an

00:34:26.155 --> 00:34:30.280
aqueduct that would bring water
from thirty-one miles away,

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:32.222
up in the mountains,
down to the city of

00:34:32.222 --> 00:34:32.920
Nîmes.
 

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:36.898
And this map gives you a very
good sense of exactly how that

00:34:36.898 --> 00:34:37.639
was done.
 

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:42.143
The source was up there,
at the top, the top pink circle

00:34:42.143 --> 00:34:46.400
up here, made its way all the
way down to the city of

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.119
Nîmes here.
 

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:53.210
Now the Romans were very clever
about how they built aqueducts.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.298
They let gravity and the change
in terrain essentially do the

00:34:57.298 --> 00:34:58.389
work for them.
 

00:34:58.389 --> 00:35:02.780
They placed terracotta pipes
underground,

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.250
for the most part,
on sloping ground,

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:08.672
and allowed the water to come
from the hillsides or the

00:35:08.672 --> 00:35:12.469
mountains down into the city,
just as they did here.

00:35:12.469 --> 00:35:18.206
On occasion they allowed those
terracotta tubes to be carried

00:35:18.206 --> 00:35:19.639
by low walls.
 

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:24.112
But sometimes they got to a
point where they had to cross a

00:35:24.112 --> 00:35:27.041
body of water,
and that is exactly what

00:35:27.041 --> 00:35:28.429
happened here.
 

00:35:28.429 --> 00:35:31.599
The River Gard of the city of
Nîmes,

00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:34.710
of the area of Nîmes,
goes through--is located at

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:39.034
this particular point,
and so the aqueduct system had

00:35:39.034 --> 00:35:40.730
to cross the river.
 

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:41.949
How did they do that?
 

00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:44.748
They couldn't tunnel it
underground, they couldn't place

00:35:44.748 --> 00:35:47.039
it on a low wall,
so what they did was build a

00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:49.594
bridge;
they built a bridge to carry

00:35:49.594 --> 00:35:52.230
that water across the body of
water.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.518
And the result of that is what
you see here.

00:35:55.518 --> 00:35:58.699
This is the famous Pont du Gard
at Nîmes.

00:35:58.699 --> 00:36:03.500
This is the bridge that serves
to carry the water across.

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:08.097
They place the terracotta pipes
in the aqueduct itself,

00:36:08.097 --> 00:36:12.268
and that water is carried
across that aqueduct.

00:36:12.268 --> 00:36:14.778
Now what's particularly
extraordinary about this

00:36:14.778 --> 00:36:17.940
monument,
besides that feat of taking

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:22.585
that water across the river,
is the fact that it is--well if

00:36:22.585 --> 00:36:24.789
you look at the building
technique,

00:36:24.789 --> 00:36:28.429
you can tell that it is made of
ashlar masonry;

00:36:28.429 --> 00:36:31.300
ashlar masonry that is local
stone,

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.090
in this particular case,
as we have seen is the case,

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.855
for the most part,
in architecture in the south of

00:36:38.855 --> 00:36:41.039
France,
in the Roman period.

00:36:41.039 --> 00:36:44.018
But what is amazing about this
particular aqueduct,

00:36:44.018 --> 00:36:46.389
besides this great engineering
feat,

00:36:46.389 --> 00:36:50.447
is the fact that the architects
have paid enormous attention to

00:36:50.447 --> 00:36:54.175
the exact measurements,
not only of the arch itself,

00:36:54.175 --> 00:36:55.840
but of the arcuations.
 

00:36:55.840 --> 00:37:01.561
And they have worked up all
kinds of elaborate mathematical

00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:07.284
theorems in order to get to the
point where they play these

00:37:07.284 --> 00:37:10.179
shapes,
and the sizes of these shapes,

00:37:10.179 --> 00:37:11.889
well off against one another.
 

00:37:11.889 --> 00:37:16.295
The larger arcuations below are
perfectly mathematically worked

00:37:16.295 --> 00:37:20.630
out, so that they work well with
the smaller ones up above.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.670
And we see in a building like
this,

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.465
I think, something that is
really impressive:

00:37:25.465 --> 00:37:27.690
not only a sign of
Romanization--

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:31.226
I mean this is--when you talk
about Roman imperialism and the

00:37:31.226 --> 00:37:34.469
Romans taking over the world in
ancient Roman times,

00:37:34.469 --> 00:37:36.300
one could think about that,
in part,

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.909
in a negative way.
 

00:37:37.909 --> 00:37:41.489
I mean, imperialism and taking
over and creating an empire can

00:37:41.489 --> 00:37:42.840
be viewed negatively.
 

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.260
But one of the positive things
that the Romans brought,

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.496
one of the many positive things
that the Romans brought to these

00:37:48.496 --> 00:37:50.449
under-developed parts of the
world,

00:37:50.449 --> 00:37:54.099
was what we call Romanization;
bringing these amenities,

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:58.077
bringing things like water to a
city, so that it could live at a

00:37:58.077 --> 00:38:01.110
higher level than it was able to
live before.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.989
But besides that,
when you look at an aqueduct

00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:06.550
like the Pont du Gard at
Nîmes,

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.489
I think you'll agree that
although we would call this a

00:38:09.489 --> 00:38:12.465
feat of Roman engineering,
first and foremost,

00:38:12.465 --> 00:38:15.110
the Romans have been adept
enough,

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:18.300
both through paying attention
to these mathematical

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:21.619
considerations,
but also to carving the stone,

00:38:21.619 --> 00:38:25.090
to making the stone really work
aesthetically,

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.869
that they have essentially,
in this aqueduct,

00:38:27.869 --> 00:38:31.860
transformed engineering into
architecture,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:36.369
into what we would define as
architecture.

00:38:36.369 --> 00:38:38.400
I want to show you two other
aqueducts.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.597
The first--both of them in
Spain--the first at Tarragona

00:38:44.597 --> 00:38:48.090
and the other one at Segovia.
 

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:52.550
First a reminder of the fact
that Spain, as you'll recall,

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:57.012
was extremely important in the
Roman period because two of

00:38:57.012 --> 00:39:01.097
Rome's emperors came from Spain;
think of Trajan,

00:39:01.097 --> 00:39:04.184
who was born in Spain,
and also Hadrian,

00:39:04.184 --> 00:39:06.719
whom we see here on the left.
 

00:39:06.719 --> 00:39:10.639
A map of Spain showing the
locations of Italica,

00:39:10.639 --> 00:39:13.592
where Hadrian was born,
but also the two sites that

00:39:13.592 --> 00:39:17.050
we're going to look at,
Tarragona, Tárraco,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.679
which was located very close to
Barcelona,

00:39:19.679 --> 00:39:21.699
near the sea,
as you can see here,

00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:23.780
and then further inland
Segovia;

00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.860
Segovia which is near Madrid,
the city of Madrid.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.351
So very accessible;
for any of you traveling Spain,

00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:33.983
these are sites that are
extremely accessible,

00:39:33.983 --> 00:39:36.849
and especially Segovia,
well worth looking at.

00:39:36.849 --> 00:39:40.179
I just want to show you the
aqueduct at Tarragona briefly.

00:39:40.179 --> 00:39:44.791
You can see it here on the
screen, an aqueduct that dates

00:39:44.791 --> 00:39:46.849
to the Augustan period.
 

00:39:46.849 --> 00:39:51.199
And it's a handsome work of
architecture.

00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:54.929
It has ashlar blocks,
as you can see:

00:39:54.929 --> 00:39:56.380
local stone.
 

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.480
But it doesn't have the finesse.
 

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.929
I think you can see here now
how great the Pont du Gard is,

00:40:01.929 --> 00:40:03.750
because it doesn't--it's
attractive,

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.969
it does the job,
it's a great engineering feat--

00:40:05.969 --> 00:40:10.739
but it doesn't have the
aesthetic values that the Pont

00:40:10.739 --> 00:40:14.867
du Gard does,
with its arches that are the

00:40:14.867 --> 00:40:17.655
same size,
on the lower story,

00:40:17.655 --> 00:40:22.219
and then in the upper story it
doesn't have the appeal

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:25.822
aesthetically,
visually, that the Pont du Gard

00:40:25.822 --> 00:40:26.820
does;
but it does its job.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:32.130
However, the aqueduct at
Segovia is quite another story.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.041
The aqueduct at Segovia is
right up there with the Pont du

00:40:36.041 --> 00:40:39.677
Gard at Nîmes as one of
the great works of Roman

00:40:39.677 --> 00:40:42.559
engineering and of Roman
architecture.

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:46.387
And what makes it all the more
spectacular is how much of it is

00:40:46.387 --> 00:40:47.130
preserved.
 

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.119
And I think you can see that
extremely well here,

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:54.289
in this amazing view of the
aqueduct marching--

00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:58.711
making its way across the
center of the city of modern

00:40:58.711 --> 00:41:02.159
Segovia,
in this truly spectacular image.

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:04.586
As you can see from your
Monument List,

00:41:04.586 --> 00:41:08.420
the date of the aqueduct at
Segovia is very controversial.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.239
There are some people who think
it's first century;

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.889
there's some people who think
it's second century.

00:41:11.889 --> 00:41:15.903
I think it is most likely to be
second century,

00:41:15.903 --> 00:41:19.831
and probably put up during the
time of Trajan,

00:41:19.831 --> 00:41:21.840
the emperor Trajan.
 

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.849
But we're not sure about that.
 

00:41:23.849 --> 00:41:28.172
Whenever it was put up,
it is an incredible example of

00:41:28.172 --> 00:41:32.170
aqueduct engineering and
aqueduct architecture.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:35.474
And it does allow us to see a
couple of things that we--it's

00:41:35.474 --> 00:41:37.489
very distinctive in its own
right;

00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:39.336
it's beautiful,
but beautiful in a very

00:41:39.336 --> 00:41:41.282
different way,
as we see from the Pont du

00:41:41.282 --> 00:41:41.719
Gard.
 

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:45.498
But it does allow us to look at
a couple of other features of

00:41:45.498 --> 00:41:49.025
Roman aqueduct planning and
design that I think are worth

00:41:49.025 --> 00:41:50.159
talking about.
 

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:55.222
I show you here another view of
the aqueduct at Segovia,

00:41:55.222 --> 00:42:00.469
and you see here that it is for
the most part a two-tiered

00:42:00.469 --> 00:42:02.309
aqueduct system.
 

00:42:02.309 --> 00:42:04.940
But what they've done here to
vary it,

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.809
and to make it much more
interesting aesthetically than

00:42:07.809 --> 00:42:11.257
the aqueduct at Tarragona,
is to make those two stories

00:42:11.257 --> 00:42:12.690
different in height.
 

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:16.481
So the lower story is much
higher, as you can see,

00:42:16.481 --> 00:42:19.190
with much more attenuated
arches;

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:26.480
and then the upper tier is
lower, with much smaller arches.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.577
The other thing that they've
done -- using local stone --

00:42:29.577 --> 00:42:32.619
they have left the stone in a
somewhat rougher state.

00:42:32.619 --> 00:42:35.101
It isn't quite as rough,
perhaps, as Claudius'

00:42:35.101 --> 00:42:37.875
buildings--
but left in a fairly rough

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:40.800
state, which gives it a real
sense,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.630
as you look at it,
of the texture of that stone,

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.947
of the materiality of that
stone, in a way that makes this

00:42:47.947 --> 00:42:52.340
particular building extremely
attractive and impressive.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.594
And you can see here--this view
is also very helpful because you

00:42:56.594 --> 00:43:00.510
can see people standing below
which gives you some sense of

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:04.090
the very large scale of this
particular aqueduct.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.000
Here's another view.
 

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.130
This is one of my favorite
views of the aqueduct at

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.527
Segovia,
because I think here you can

00:43:10.527 --> 00:43:13.699
really get a sense of the
coloration of the stone,

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:17.039
of the texture of this slightly
rough stone,

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:19.887
and of the way,
even in the architecture of

00:43:19.887 --> 00:43:21.510
aqueducts--
again mainly,

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.590
an aqueduct is built mainly for
a practical purpose,

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:29.353
to bring water from one
part--one place to another

00:43:29.353 --> 00:43:31.557
place,
to provide an amenity,

00:43:31.557 --> 00:43:35.182
as we've talked about it,
a significant and important

00:43:35.182 --> 00:43:36.659
day-to-day amenity.
 

00:43:36.659 --> 00:43:40.351
But even with that,
even though it is essentially a

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.894
practical building,
aesthetics are never far from

00:43:43.894 --> 00:43:45.518
the Romans' minds.
 

00:43:45.518 --> 00:43:48.659
And when this particular
aqueduct was designed,

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:52.132
not only did the designer have
in mind the texture of the stone

00:43:52.132 --> 00:43:54.539
and the way in which the light
of Spain,

00:43:54.539 --> 00:43:57.740
this particular part of Spain,
hits that stone at any given

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.255
time of day,
but the whole concept of vista

00:44:00.255 --> 00:44:00.650
again.
 

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.722
When you wander along this
particular aqueduct--because it

00:44:03.722 --> 00:44:06.016
goes on for quite awhile;
you can do that,

00:44:06.016 --> 00:44:08.630
and you're not on top of a body
of water as well.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:12.634
So you can walk along it down
below and see what you see as

00:44:12.634 --> 00:44:14.360
you meander through it.
 

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:18.371
And it is amazing aesthetically
again how they have set up a

00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:22.248
series of views and vistas,
from one part of this aqueduct

00:44:22.248 --> 00:44:23.268
to another.
 

00:44:23.268 --> 00:44:25.909
As you stand here and you look
at it,

00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:29.239
making its way,
almost marching its way--

00:44:29.239 --> 00:44:32.094
in fact, I like to think it's
Trajanic because it's almost

00:44:32.094 --> 00:44:35.050
like Trajan's army marching
through the city of Segovia,

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:38.889
off to some military exploit in
the far reaches,

00:44:38.889 --> 00:44:42.050
because--the way it marches
through the city,

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.159
as you can see here.
 

00:44:43.159 --> 00:44:47.137
But all of these wonderful
views and vistas and panoramas

00:44:47.137 --> 00:44:50.047
that one can see,
depending upon where one stands

00:44:50.047 --> 00:44:52.289
in the city,
where one stands beneath the

00:44:52.289 --> 00:44:54.800
arches themselves,
is really spectacular,

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.465
and clearly was very much in
the minds of the architect who

00:44:58.465 --> 00:44:59.539
designed this.
 

00:44:59.539 --> 00:45:03.099
Here's another very good view
where if you stand below the

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:05.871
aqueduct and look up,
this is the sort of view that

00:45:05.871 --> 00:45:08.067
you see,
with the rough stones,

00:45:08.067 --> 00:45:11.501
even in the vaults of the
arches themselves:

00:45:11.501 --> 00:45:13.260
an incredible work.
 

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.650
And again, the fact that it is
as well preserved as it is,

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.090
is really something to be
grateful for.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:23.322
Here's a very interesting view,
because it also shows you what

00:45:23.322 --> 00:45:27.210
happens with aqueduct design
when the terrain changes.

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.943
So in the center of the
city--in the views that we

00:45:29.943 --> 00:45:32.697
looked at just before--
they were able to build,

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.619
the ground level was low
enough,

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:38.268
that they were able to build
the aqueduct in two stories,

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:41.670
with that very high first story
and then the lower second story.

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:44.289
But what happens when the
terrain shifts,

00:45:44.289 --> 00:45:47.407
when you go--because again
they're taking advantage of a

00:45:47.407 --> 00:45:49.449
source that is located higher
up,

00:45:49.449 --> 00:45:54.195
with the hope that gravity will
do the work for them and allow

00:45:54.195 --> 00:45:57.230
that water to flow from that
source,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:58.550
down into the city.
 

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.500
And that is exactly what they
did here.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.239
The source is farther away and
it's high.

00:46:03.239 --> 00:46:07.492
So the water has to be piped
into this structure and make its

00:46:07.492 --> 00:46:10.400
way down from the hillside to
the city.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:15.090
So you see the ground rising
here, to go up that hill.

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:19.259
And what happens is that they
have to adjust the aqueduct

00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:21.940
according to the changing
terrain.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.329
So if you look at this
particular section,

00:46:24.329 --> 00:46:27.420
you will see that the bottom
story is just an arch.

00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:31.956
The arch rests on the ground,
so that they--because it has to

00:46:31.956 --> 00:46:36.039
be much shorter at this juncture
than anywhere else.

00:46:36.039 --> 00:46:39.536
And you see the same--well you
see it changing somewhat here,

00:46:39.536 --> 00:46:40.820
as it makes its way.
 

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.550
But you see it rounding the
corner,

00:46:42.550 --> 00:46:44.699
and the way they have had to
make these adjustments,

00:46:44.699 --> 00:46:49.157
and made them so well,
without losing the impressive

00:46:49.157 --> 00:46:53.440
aesthetic quality of this
particular structure.

00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.447
Once again, a tribute to the
fact that these Roman architects

00:46:57.447 --> 00:47:01.456
were not only great engineers
but also, without any question,

00:47:01.456 --> 00:47:03.260
world-class architects.
 

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.130
There's an interesting monument
that is located--

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:09.309
you can see the aqueduct of
Segovia in the back left there--

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:14.094
there's an interesting monument
that was put up to celebrate the

00:47:14.094 --> 00:47:17.360
bi-millennium of the aqueduct in
Segovia.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:22.480
And it's interesting to see
what they put at the top:

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:27.992
the she-wolf suckling Romulus
and Remus to underscore the

00:47:27.992 --> 00:47:34.000
close connections between
ancient Roman Segovia and Rome.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.594
Another very interesting
building in France is the one

00:47:38.594 --> 00:47:42.409
that I show you now,
which was a fountain.

00:47:42.409 --> 00:47:47.619
These aqueducts brought not
only water for daily use but fed

00:47:47.619 --> 00:47:48.679
fountains.
 

00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:53.561
And I want to show you one
fountain from Roman Gaul,

00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:59.210
from what is France today,
the so-called Temple of Diana.

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:01.539
It wasn't a temple,
it was a fountain,

00:48:01.539 --> 00:48:04.184
as I mentioned,
and it was built during the

00:48:04.184 --> 00:48:06.829
Hadrianic period,
between 100 and 130.

00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:09.914
What makes this fountain
particularly interesting is if

00:48:09.914 --> 00:48:11.914
we just looked at this--
if I asked you,

00:48:11.914 --> 00:48:13.833
if I put this up and said to
you: "What do you think

00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:14.449
this was?"
 

00:48:14.449 --> 00:48:16.739
you would be unlikely to say a
fountain;

00:48:16.739 --> 00:48:19.925
because you can see that this
structure is in the form of a

00:48:19.925 --> 00:48:20.530
basilica.
 

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:24.083
It's a barrel-vaulted central
chamber, with side aisles that

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.650
are also barrel-vaulted.
 

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:28.289
You can see the barrel vault of
this side aisle over here.

00:48:28.289 --> 00:48:30.829
You can see a barrel vault of
the central space here.

00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:34.280
You can see that there are
columns on tall bases.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.858
You can make out,
over here, a triangular

00:48:36.858 --> 00:48:38.730
pediment on top of a niche.
 

00:48:38.730 --> 00:48:41.418
There were a series of niches
along the wall,

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:44.719
with alternating triangular and
segmental pediments.

00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:49.590
But most interesting of all is
the central space,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:53.148
the central barrel-vaulted
space, with these barrel-vaulted

00:48:53.148 --> 00:48:55.737
side aisles,
which is exactly the scheme of

00:48:55.737 --> 00:48:56.849
a typical basilica.
 

00:48:56.849 --> 00:48:59.815
And it's another example of
something I've shown you

00:48:59.815 --> 00:49:02.376
throughout the semester,
that I've called the

00:49:02.376 --> 00:49:05.519
interchangeability of form;
the way in which certain

00:49:05.519 --> 00:49:07.994
building types,
in this case a basilica,

00:49:07.994 --> 00:49:11.614
built initially as a civic
structure for the trying of law

00:49:11.614 --> 00:49:14.981
cases,
becomes a plan that is used in

00:49:14.981 --> 00:49:18.032
other contexts;
whether it's in residential

00:49:18.032 --> 00:49:20.096
architecture,
as we've already seen,

00:49:20.096 --> 00:49:22.809
and in this case in the form of
a fountain.

00:49:22.809 --> 00:49:24.420
So that's particularly
interesting.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.936
Also interesting is the fact
that although this is a

00:49:26.936 --> 00:49:30.126
barrel-vaulted structure,
it is made entirely out of

00:49:30.126 --> 00:49:33.253
local stone --
no concrete whatsoever in this

00:49:33.253 --> 00:49:35.130
particular part of France.
 

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.679
No concrete, stone construction.
 

00:49:37.679 --> 00:49:40.893
It's a masterwork when you
consider that this was all done

00:49:40.893 --> 00:49:43.150
out of stone,
and done extremely well.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.280
Look how smooth the stones are.
 

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:49.905
And look, the designers have
even been talented enough to

00:49:49.905 --> 00:49:54.119
create ribs, with stone,
in that stone barrel vault,

00:49:54.119 --> 00:49:56.679
for this amazing structure.
 

00:49:56.679 --> 00:49:58.894
And you should be reminded,
when I talk about the

00:49:58.894 --> 00:50:01.885
interchangeability of form,
of the underground basilica

00:50:01.885 --> 00:50:05.047
that we looked at way back when,
in the time of Claudius,

00:50:05.047 --> 00:50:08.103
which was built underground,
made out of concrete,

00:50:08.103 --> 00:50:10.672
faced with stucco,
as you'll recall,

00:50:10.672 --> 00:50:15.208
but used for a secret sect,
and in this case the use of

00:50:15.208 --> 00:50:21.139
this basilican structure for a
fountain in Roman France.

00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:25.217
Up to this point we have looked
at monuments that were made

00:50:25.217 --> 00:50:29.436
possible by Rome's subjugation
of this particular part of the

00:50:29.436 --> 00:50:32.967
world;
the subjugation we know of at

00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:36.090
least forty-four Alpine tribes.
 

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:39.367
And so while all of these
buildings that I've shown you

00:50:39.367 --> 00:50:43.130
come because of that subjugation
and subsequent Romanization of

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.454
the area,
there is one monument,

00:50:45.454 --> 00:50:48.329
spectacularly sited,
that actually celebrates,

00:50:48.329 --> 00:50:51.501
honors, that very subjugation,
and it's to that that I now

00:50:51.501 --> 00:50:52.219
want to turn.
 

00:50:52.219 --> 00:50:55.557
It is, as I mentioned
spectacularly sited,

00:50:55.557 --> 00:50:59.057
along the French Riviera,
not far from Nice,

00:50:59.057 --> 00:51:01.420
not far from Monte Carlo.
 

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:03.090
You see it here.
 

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:08.768
It is the Trophy of Augustus,
the Tropaeum Augusti,

00:51:08.768 --> 00:51:10.139
as you'll see on your Monument
List,

00:51:10.139 --> 00:51:14.347
that is located in a town
called La Turbie and you can see

00:51:14.347 --> 00:51:18.260
it rising up in the midst of
modern La Turbie here.

00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:24.070
It dates, we believe,
to 7 to 6 B.C.,

00:51:24.070 --> 00:51:27.239
and thus in the age of
Augustus, and celebrates,

00:51:27.239 --> 00:51:29.972
quite specifically,
Augustus'--and the inscription

00:51:29.972 --> 00:51:32.737
tells us this--
Augustus' subjugation of

00:51:32.737 --> 00:51:37.360
forty-four Alpine tribes in this
particular part of the world:

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:41.530
a monument put up to honor that
victory of Augustus.

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.960
So essentially a trophy
monument.

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:46.730
You can see that it is only
partially preserved.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:51.152
And I show you here a view of
it down the street,

00:51:51.152 --> 00:51:54.469
the modern street,
as it looks today,

00:51:54.469 --> 00:51:59.260
where you can see it rising up
over that street.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:02.681
And if you look very carefully,
you will see that the stone

00:52:02.681 --> 00:52:05.809
that the structure is made out
of is very similar--

00:52:05.809 --> 00:52:09.487
in fact exactly the same--as
the stone used for the local

00:52:09.487 --> 00:52:10.079
houses.
 

00:52:10.079 --> 00:52:12.579
Now this is very interesting,
because what--

00:52:12.579 --> 00:52:15.893
the monument did not look--even
though it's only partially

00:52:15.893 --> 00:52:19.581
preserved today,
even less of it was preserved

00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:23.815
earlier on,
and it was in the 1930s that an

00:52:23.815 --> 00:52:29.369
American patron decided that he
wanted to reconstruct,

00:52:29.369 --> 00:52:33.998
as best that could be done,
the Trophy Monument at La

00:52:33.998 --> 00:52:34.800
Turbie.
 

00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:38.353
Because there was recognition
that the monument at La Turbie

00:52:38.353 --> 00:52:41.771
had served as a quarry,
essentially for the local

00:52:41.771 --> 00:52:44.626
inhabitants,
and that over the years they

00:52:44.626 --> 00:52:48.065
had been taking the stone from
the Victory Monument of

00:52:48.065 --> 00:52:50.088
Augustus,
and using it--that's why it's

00:52:50.088 --> 00:52:52.690
the same stone--
using it in their houses.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:55.239
And this American wanted to
rectify it,

00:52:55.239 --> 00:53:02.409
so he donated the funds that
enabled them to tear down,

00:53:02.409 --> 00:53:05.092
to demolish,
thirty-two houses,

00:53:05.092 --> 00:53:10.550
and come up with 3000 fragments
from the Victory Monument,

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.045
the trophy at La Turbie,
and reconstruct it as best as

00:53:14.045 --> 00:53:16.289
they could from those fragments.
 

00:53:16.289 --> 00:53:18.050
And that's what you see there
now.

00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:21.559
Here's a view of it as it looks
today, as well as a model.

00:53:21.559 --> 00:53:24.597
And what you can see from both
of these is not only the

00:53:24.597 --> 00:53:26.849
inscription and the trophy in
relief,

00:53:26.849 --> 00:53:28.722
on this side,
that mentions the forty-four

00:53:28.722 --> 00:53:31.119
Alpine tribes,
but the monument itself.

00:53:31.119 --> 00:53:34.920
And this model makes it very
clear what the general form was:

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:37.911
a round structure,
with columns encircling it,

00:53:37.911 --> 00:53:40.369
on a base,
and then the whole thing placed

00:53:40.369 --> 00:53:42.545
on a very large--
a tall pedestal,

00:53:42.545 --> 00:53:45.340
with a pyramidal element at the
top,

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:48.119
and a crowing statue at the
very apex.

00:53:48.119 --> 00:53:51.965
This scheme of placing a
rotunda on top of a tall base is

00:53:51.965 --> 00:53:55.813
something that we have seen as
characteristic of funerary

00:53:55.813 --> 00:53:59.420
architecture,
from the age of Augustus.

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:02.360
Think of the Tomb of Caecilia
Metella, for example.

00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.059
And it is that scheme that is
used here.

00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:08.500
So another example of this
interchangeability of form --

00:54:08.500 --> 00:54:13.376
that a form that was used for
mausoleum architecture now used

00:54:13.376 --> 00:54:16.646
for a trophy monument,
of the same time,

00:54:16.646 --> 00:54:19.409
but in a different part of the
world.

00:54:19.409 --> 00:54:24.432
The model also shows you that
there were niches around the

00:54:24.432 --> 00:54:26.989
central circular structure.
 

00:54:26.989 --> 00:54:31.384
Those had in them portraits of
Augustus' lieutenants,

00:54:31.384 --> 00:54:36.369
who helped him placate this
particular part of the world.

00:54:36.369 --> 00:54:40.634
And then at the top of the
stepped pyramidal structure,

00:54:40.634 --> 00:54:45.530
a portrait, a bronze statue of
the emperor Augustus himself.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:50.154
Here's a detail of the Victory
Monument at La Turbie,

00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:55.134
with all of those stones from
those thirty-two demolished

00:54:55.134 --> 00:54:58.780
houses reused here to
reconstruct it.

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.755
There is concrete used here,
but it's a Gallo-Roman form of

00:55:02.755 --> 00:55:03.510
concrete.
 

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:06.474
You'll see in Ward-Perkins that
he refers to this work as

00:55:06.474 --> 00:55:10.659
petit appareil,
p-e-t-i-t a-p-p-a-r-e-i-l,

00:55:10.659 --> 00:55:14.788
petit appareil,
which is essentially a

00:55:14.788 --> 00:55:17.969
Gallo-Roman version of concrete
construction,

00:55:17.969 --> 00:55:21.130
with stone facing,
little work,

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:25.059
little pieces of stone,
that are very similar to

00:55:25.059 --> 00:55:28.141
opus incertum,
but different enough and

00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:33.320
distinctively French enough to
be called petit appareil.

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.608
The victories,
Augustus' victories and

00:55:35.608 --> 00:55:38.889
pacification of this part of the
world also led to the

00:55:38.889 --> 00:55:40.559
construction of arches.
 

00:55:40.559 --> 00:55:44.268
And I want to turn to a couple
of those now.

00:55:44.268 --> 00:55:45.407
The Arch at St.
 

00:55:45.407 --> 00:55:48.519
Rêmy, also in the south
of France.

00:55:48.519 --> 00:55:49.409
You see it here.
 

00:55:49.409 --> 00:55:53.820
It dates to around 20 B.C.,
and it probably served as both

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:57.534
an arch in honor of these
victories that Augustus

00:55:57.534 --> 00:56:00.768
celebrated here,
but also as a gateway into the

00:56:00.768 --> 00:56:01.090
city.
 

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:02.329
It's very simple.
 

00:56:02.329 --> 00:56:05.375
It looks very much like we've
come to know Augustan arches

00:56:05.375 --> 00:56:07.338
are,
with a single arcuated bay in

00:56:07.338 --> 00:56:09.947
the center,
columns, in this case,

00:56:09.947 --> 00:56:13.150
on two separate bases,
fluted columns.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:16.065
The capitals are not preserved,
so we don't know if they were

00:56:16.065 --> 00:56:18.400
Corinthian, but they were
probably Corinthian.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:21.487
A very elaborate archivolt,
as you can see here,

00:56:21.487 --> 00:56:24.510
with the coffering extremely
well preserved.

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:27.244
And then if you look very
closely at the decoration,

00:56:27.244 --> 00:56:30.139
you see a couple of figures
standing on either side.

00:56:30.139 --> 00:56:32.507
These are actually--they're
headless now--but they're

00:56:32.507 --> 00:56:34.688
actually figures of captives;
of captives,

00:56:34.688 --> 00:56:37.766
of local captives,
to make reference again to the

00:56:37.766 --> 00:56:41.217
fact that this was military,
a military operation,

00:56:41.217 --> 00:56:43.679
that allowed Augustus to take
over,

00:56:43.679 --> 00:56:46.949
to subjugate these forty-four
Alpine tribes,

00:56:46.949 --> 00:56:50.340
and others in this particular
area,

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:54.219
and that that subjugation is
referred to here by the

00:56:54.219 --> 00:56:57.719
representation of those captured
barbarians.

00:56:57.719 --> 00:57:01.380
A much more important and more
interesting arch is this one.

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:06.827
It's an arch that is located in
Orange--back to Orange--also in

00:57:06.827 --> 00:57:08.760
the south of France.
 

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:11.222
The date of this monument is
very controversial,

00:57:11.222 --> 00:57:13.425
and I think by looking at the
general view,

00:57:13.425 --> 00:57:15.469
and also a detail,
you can see why.

00:57:15.469 --> 00:57:18.880
It is a triple-bayed arch,
with a large central arch,

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:22.291
two smaller ones on either
side, with columns on tall

00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:25.309
bases, Corinthian columns in
between them.

00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:28.572
You can see that the central
element, with its pediment,

00:57:28.572 --> 00:57:30.650
projects into the viewer's
space.

00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:34.463
You can also see that every
inch of space is completely

00:57:34.463 --> 00:57:37.757
covered with decoration--
figural decoration,

00:57:37.757 --> 00:57:40.750
piles of arms and armor from
the enemy--

00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:44.840
so much so that it tends to
dematerialize the arch.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:48.030
These are all characteristics
of later Roman architecture--

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:50.039
think the Arch of Septimius
Severus,

00:57:50.039 --> 00:57:52.000
which I'll show you again in a
moment--

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.184
which has led some scholars to
date this as late as A.D.

00:57:56.184 --> 00:57:57.021
200 or A.D.
 

00:57:57.021 --> 00:58:01.739
203,204, at the same time as
the Arch of Septimius Severus.

00:58:01.739 --> 00:58:05.733
And it was long thought to be
that also because no one could

00:58:05.733 --> 00:58:09.795
concede that this idea of the
triple-bayed arch could turn up

00:58:09.795 --> 00:58:12.909
in let's say Augustan or
Tiberian France,

00:58:12.909 --> 00:58:16.940
Gaul, before it turned up in
Rome.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:20.070
So getting back to that issue
I've raised on several occasions

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:21.559
about center and periphery.
 

00:58:21.559 --> 00:58:22.909
Does everything flow from the
center,

00:58:22.909 --> 00:58:26.164
or are forms sometimes
developed in the periphery and

00:58:26.164 --> 00:58:28.920
then make their way back into
the center,

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:32.760
is an age-old and very
interesting question to ask.

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.222
But I think you can see the
reasons why scholars,

00:58:36.222 --> 00:58:39.396
some scholars,
have dated this to the Severan

00:58:39.396 --> 00:58:40.190
period.
 

00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:42.760
Here's a view--and I'll say
more about that in a moment--

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.494
a view here,
another view showing an

00:58:45.494 --> 00:58:48.322
engraving,
giving you a sense of the kind

00:58:48.322 --> 00:58:52.010
of sculptural decoration that
would've been placed at the top:

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.550
the omnipresent figure in the
chariot,

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:57.619
four-horse, or in the
case--four-horse,

00:58:57.619 --> 00:58:59.320
I think, in this case, chariot.
 

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:07.329
And then figures of captured
barbarians, as well as trophies

00:59:07.329 --> 00:59:09.230
on the apex.
 

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:12.231
Here's our comparison with the
Arch of Septimius Severus in the

00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:12.909
Roman Forum.
 

00:59:12.909 --> 00:59:16.027
And I think you can see the
close association between the

00:59:16.027 --> 00:59:19.641
two: the triple bay,
the profusion of decoration

00:59:19.641 --> 00:59:24.389
that we see in the arch on the
left-hand side as well.

00:59:24.389 --> 00:59:28.335
Here's a detail of the attic,
which shows you an interesting

00:59:28.335 --> 00:59:32.349
battle scene where the figures
are very heavily outlined,

00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:34.260
as you can see here,
which is unusual.

00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:37.659
Scholars have suggested,
and I think correctly,

00:59:37.659 --> 00:59:41.268
that the reason for that is
that these artists,

00:59:41.268 --> 00:59:45.693
in this part of Gaul,
were probably working from copy

00:59:45.693 --> 00:59:48.452
books,
or copy scrolls I guess I

00:59:48.452 --> 00:59:51.639
should say: drawings of battle
scenes,

00:59:51.639 --> 00:59:55.550
typical Greco-Roman battle
scenes, that they could use--

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:59.074
Hellenistic battle scenes
perhaps, or early Roman battle

00:59:59.074 --> 01:00:00.869
scenes-- that they copied.
 

01:00:00.869 --> 01:00:05.007
And these were drawings,
and consequently they copied

01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:08.905
them quite exactly,
by showing the outlines around

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.179
the figures.
 

01:00:10.179 --> 01:00:13.067
It's a speculation,
but I think it's an interesting

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:16.242
speculation, in this very
frenzied battle scene from the

01:00:16.242 --> 01:00:17.340
uppermost part.
 

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.731
With regard to the date of this
monument though,

01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:20.750
the plot thickens.
 

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:21.690
Oh, one other detail.
 

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:25.791
If you look at the side of the
arch, you see an arcuated

01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:27.059
element inside.
 

01:00:27.059 --> 01:00:30.101
You can barely see the
triangular pediment,

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:34.012
but there's an arcuation inside
an unbroken, a complete

01:00:34.012 --> 01:00:35.750
triangular pediment.
 

01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:39.074
So that scheme of placing the
arcuation also tends to be a

01:00:39.074 --> 01:00:39.949
late feature.
 

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:43.244
However, scholars who've spent
a lot of time looking at the

01:00:43.244 --> 01:00:45.630
sculptural decoration of this
monument,

01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:48.889
at the piles of arms and armor
that one finds there--

01:00:48.889 --> 01:00:51.606
which, by the way,
includes piles of arms and

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:54.677
armor from a naval victory,
which is interesting,

01:00:54.677 --> 01:00:58.159
as well as piles of arms and
armor from victories on land,

01:00:58.159 --> 01:01:01.623
which has made some scholars
speculate that this refers to a

01:01:01.623 --> 01:01:05.155
kind of generic victory,
to victory on land and sea,

01:01:05.155 --> 01:01:07.030
by whomever this honored.
 

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:14.088
But very interesting is the
fact that there is one armament

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:21.027
that is inscribed with the name
Sacrovir, S-a-c-r-o-v-i-r,

01:01:21.027 --> 01:01:22.610
Sacrovir.
 

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:27.349
Sacrovir we know was someone
who was living and active in the

01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:28.849
time of Tiberius.
 

01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:32.842
He led a revolt in this part of
Gaul, in A.D.

01:01:32.842 --> 01:01:37.652
21, against the local Roman
governor and his excessive

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:38.559
taxes.
 

01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:42.760
And it has been speculated that
that Sacrovir,

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:45.809
who is mentioned here,
is that very same Sacrovir,

01:01:45.809 --> 01:01:50.404
and that it is very conceivable
therefore that this arch was put

01:01:50.404 --> 01:01:52.518
up in the time of Tiberius.
 

01:01:52.518 --> 01:01:54.550
I've given you a date of A.D.
 

01:01:54.550 --> 01:01:54.829
25.
 

01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:58.632
I believe that myself,
although it does defy

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.992
imagination,
to a certain extent,

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:03.536
to think of an arch,
with all of these features that

01:02:03.536 --> 01:02:07.016
I've described today,
as early in the south of France

01:02:07.016 --> 01:02:07.565
as A.D.
 

01:02:07.565 --> 01:02:07.960
25.
 

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:12.003
But it's something for you to
think about in terms of our

01:02:12.003 --> 01:02:15.759
whole question of the
relationship between center and

01:02:15.759 --> 01:02:16.768
periphery.
 

01:02:16.768 --> 01:02:20.460
I want to show you the last
group relatively quickly,

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:24.239
just to dip into Istria,
as I said I would,

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:27.900
to the uppermost part of what
is today Croatia,

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:30.487
to look at one more arch,
in a different part of the

01:02:30.487 --> 01:02:33.378
Roman world,
but during the same period,

01:02:33.378 --> 01:02:37.480
the end of the first century
B.C., an arch at Pola.

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.389
I show you the location here of
Pola,

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:44.829
or Pula, at the very uppermost
part of Croatia,

01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:47.389
very close, exactly at,
I mean it's just--

01:02:47.389 --> 01:02:50.389
when I went there once,
you literally,

01:02:50.389 --> 01:02:52.539
you go across the border and
there you are,

01:02:52.539 --> 01:02:54.849
the Italian border,
you're in Pola.

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:57.219
And you see the rest of Croatia
here,

01:02:57.219 --> 01:02:59.268
with the other great site of
Split,

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:02.740
which we'll look at next time,
and of course the famous city

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.329
of Dubrovnik at the base.
 

01:03:04.329 --> 01:03:07.199
You see the arch extremely well
preserved.

01:03:07.199 --> 01:03:10.523
Another typical Augustan arch:
single bayed,

01:03:10.523 --> 01:03:12.766
two columns,
Corinthian order,

01:03:12.766 --> 01:03:14.389
on a shared base.
 

01:03:14.389 --> 01:03:17.079
If you look at the attic,
the attic is interesting.

01:03:17.079 --> 01:03:18.420
Local stone once again.
 

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.594
Look at the attic,
you'll see bases that are

01:03:20.594 --> 01:03:23.010
inscribed at the top,
and those bases are very

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:26.159
helpful in terms of telling us
something quite extraordinary,

01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:28.980
and that is that this arch was
put up by a woman.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.353
We know her name:
Salvia Postuma,

01:03:32.353 --> 01:03:36.889
Salvia Postuma,
Sa-l-v-i-a P-o-s-t-u-m-a.

01:03:36.889 --> 01:03:39.242
Salvia Postuma,
who put this monument up to

01:03:39.242 --> 01:03:41.260
three male members of her
family,

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:45.047
who were involved in military
operations at this particular

01:03:45.047 --> 01:03:48.402
time,
died, and then were honored by

01:03:48.402 --> 01:03:49.820
this monument.
 

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:53.976
I show you a reconstruction of
what the uppermost part probably

01:03:53.976 --> 01:03:57.599
looked like when there were
statues of those three male

01:03:57.599 --> 01:04:00.927
members of the family,
possibly in their military

01:04:00.927 --> 01:04:02.936
costumes,
although we don't know for

01:04:02.936 --> 01:04:04.829
sure, at the apex of the
structure.

01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:08.297
Here's a detail of it also over
here, where you see victories in

01:04:08.297 --> 01:04:11.010
the spandrels;
you see the Corinthian capitals;

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:13.070
you see cupids carrying
garlands;

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:14.719
all the kind of decoration.
 

01:04:14.719 --> 01:04:18.476
You see some acanthus leaves,
very much like those in the Ara

01:04:18.476 --> 01:04:21.481
Pacis: all the kinds of
decoration that have been

01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:23.860
transported from Rome to be
used,

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:27.664
in this case,
in the north of former

01:04:27.664 --> 01:04:30.599
Yugoslavia for this arch.
 

01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:32.760
We see the Corinthian capitals
here.

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.420
We see the victories here.
 

01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:37.789
We see the cupids with the
garlands over there.

01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:40.090
We see a chariot scene here.
 

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:42.661
The chariot scene is an
interesting reference to the

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:45.563
race of life,
a reference to victory in

01:04:45.563 --> 01:04:49.365
athletic competition,
as well as victory over--you

01:04:49.365 --> 01:04:51.780
see the bucrania there
also;

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.139
clearly another touch of Rome,
of the Ara Pacis.

01:04:55.139 --> 01:04:57.494
But this interesting--we've
seen this throughout the

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.456
semester,
the close correlation in the

01:04:59.456 --> 01:05:01.869
minds of the Romans between
victory in battle,

01:05:01.869 --> 01:05:05.788
victory in athletic
competition, victory in the

01:05:05.788 --> 01:05:08.659
hunt,
and also victory over death.

01:05:08.659 --> 01:05:12.469
And all of that comes together
well in the arch here.

01:05:12.469 --> 01:05:15.199
If you look up into the vault,
it's very well preserved.

01:05:15.199 --> 01:05:20.262
In the center a representation
of an eagle, with a serpent,

01:05:20.262 --> 01:05:24.123
holding a serpent;
this is probably a reference to

01:05:24.123 --> 01:05:25.420
death and rebirth.
 

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:27.610
And remember,
this is Augustan in date,

01:05:27.610 --> 01:05:30.840
so it predates the vault of the
Arch of Titus in Rome.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.822
But this whole idea of placing
in the vault a scene of death

01:05:34.822 --> 01:05:38.806
and rebirth, leads ultimately,
I think, to that divinization

01:05:38.806 --> 01:05:40.090
scene of Titus.
 

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:44.724
I want to take you very quickly
to show you an important tower

01:05:44.724 --> 01:05:46.472
tomb in the city of St.
 

01:05:46.472 --> 01:05:50.195
Rêmy--we're back in the
south of France--St.

01:05:50.195 --> 01:05:53.920
Rêmy, the ancient Glanum,
G-l-a-n-u-m;

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.340
ancient Glanum,
which was a very highly

01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:59.079
developed town,
also in the Greek period.

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:01.199
So here we see some overlay.
 

01:06:01.199 --> 01:06:03.768
We have local Celtic custom.
 

01:06:03.768 --> 01:06:08.050
The Greeks infiltrated here,
then the Romans;

01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:11.170
all of that piled one on top of
another, to make a very

01:06:11.170 --> 01:06:12.268
distinctive city.
 

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:15.005
You can also see from the
remains, there are extensive

01:06:15.005 --> 01:06:17.768
remains at Glanum,
more than most of these ancient

01:06:17.768 --> 01:06:20.963
French towns,
where you can see baths and

01:06:20.963 --> 01:06:25.820
temples and parts of houses and
peristyles and so on,

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.389
quite well preserved.
 

01:06:27.389 --> 01:06:29.760
I show you here,
for example,

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.639
some honorific bases and
altars.

01:06:32.639 --> 01:06:35.637
And over here a hypocaust from
one of the baths,

01:06:35.637 --> 01:06:38.764
looking very much like a
hypocaust we would see in

01:06:38.764 --> 01:06:40.360
Pompeii of like date.
 

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:42.824
I also want to mention,
in case any of you are making

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:45.099
your way to the south of France
anytime soon,

01:06:45.099 --> 01:06:47.027
it is located,
the city of Glanum,

01:06:47.027 --> 01:06:50.239
located very close to the
wonderful town of Les Baux;

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:52.512
in fact, Glanum is in the
shadow of Les Baux,

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:54.579
that lies in the mountains on
the top.

01:06:54.579 --> 01:06:56.844
A fabulous place to
just--nothing to do with Roman

01:06:56.844 --> 01:06:58.969
antiquity but just a great place
to wander,

01:06:58.969 --> 01:07:01.679
as you can see here,
and every one of the caves,

01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:04.789
and there are a lot of them,
have places for wine tasting.

01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:07.150
So it's a fun place to go.
 

01:07:07.150 --> 01:07:08.289
Here are the two monuments.
 

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:09.420
We saw the arch already.
 

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.710
This is the tower tomb.
 

01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:13.920
These are referred to by the
locals as Les Antiques,

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.960
Les Antiques;
the arch--the antiquities--the

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.480
arch and the tower tomb.
 

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.530
And the fact that they are in
close proximity;

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:22.909
I mentioned the arch may well
have been a city gate.

01:07:22.909 --> 01:07:26.349
The Romans always buried their
dead outside the city gate.

01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:28.369
City gate, cemetery right
outside.

01:07:28.369 --> 01:07:30.449
Extremely well preserved.
 

01:07:30.449 --> 01:07:34.190
Tower tomb, tower tomb because
it's taller than it is wide.

01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:37.708
This area of France is
particularly famous because of

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:39.739
Vincent van Gogh,
one again.

01:07:39.739 --> 01:07:43.373
Van Gogh spent his last years
in an insane asylum,

01:07:43.373 --> 01:07:45.597
as many of you may know,
in St.

01:07:45.597 --> 01:07:46.710
Rêmy.
 

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.860
This insane asylum--which you
can see;

01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:52.067
this is a Van Gogh painting of
that asylum in which he spent

01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:55.164
those last days--is located
exactly across the street from

01:07:55.164 --> 01:07:56.469
Les Antiques.
 

01:07:56.469 --> 01:07:57.960
So if you make the pilgrimage
there,

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.603
I hope you'll make the
pilgrimage not only to see Van

01:08:00.603 --> 01:08:02.268
Gogh,
but I hope that you're

01:08:02.268 --> 01:08:05.130
aficionados now of--
in fact, I hope that you go to

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:08.675
see Les Antiques and then
also go to see the asylum of Van

01:08:08.675 --> 01:08:09.119
Gogh.
 

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:14.931
Here's the monument of the
Julii, a tower tomb that was put

01:08:14.931 --> 01:08:15.831
up in St.
 

01:08:15.831 --> 01:08:19.840
Rêmy in 30 to 20 B.C.,
so the cusp,

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:24.750
the late-Caesarian into the
Augustan period.

01:08:24.750 --> 01:08:28.000
And we think the Julii
represented here are in fact

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.899
veterans of Julius Caesar's
army, who have taken his name.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:35.646
Julius Caesar,
all of his great military

01:08:35.646 --> 01:08:39.328
exploits in Gaul,
referred to here by his

01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:43.990
veterans who have taken his name
and have settled here on land

01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:48.119
that they were given in reward
for their good work.

01:08:48.119 --> 01:08:51.220
Again it's a tower tomb;
taller than it is wide;

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:54.725
a stepped base;
a socle with sculptural figural

01:08:54.725 --> 01:08:57.560
frieze;
a quadrifrons up here;

01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:00.851
Corinthian columns;
and then at the very apex a

01:09:00.851 --> 01:09:04.239
tholos that has two
statues inside that

01:09:04.239 --> 01:09:05.520
tholos.
 

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.380
This is pretty much the
best-preserved Roman tomb that

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:08.920
we have.
 

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.408
Everything is intact here.
 

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:13.740
We believe--remember I
mentioned way at the beginning

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:17.328
that we think that a lot of
these Roman ideas came to the

01:09:17.328 --> 01:09:20.827
south of France via North Italy,
and we think this was indeed

01:09:20.827 --> 01:09:21.229
the case.
 

01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:24.850
In North Italy we know they put
up a lot of these tower tombs,

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:28.550
and we think it's likely that
this sort of thing imitates some

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:31.279
of those tower tombs in the
north of Italy.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:35.016
I show you a detail of two of
the figural friezes from the

01:09:35.016 --> 01:09:38.229
socle of the monument,
which you can see represent

01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:39.408
battle scenes.
 

01:09:39.408 --> 01:09:41.630
And you can also see those deep
outlines,

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:45.024
just as we saw at the Orange
Arch, which once again suggest

01:09:45.024 --> 01:09:48.534
to us that these artists are
looking at drawings of this kind

01:09:48.534 --> 01:09:51.520
of thing that come from the
Greco-Roman world,

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:53.340
and they are copying what they
see.

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:55.109
I don't have time to go into it
here,

01:09:55.109 --> 01:09:57.430
but if you look with care at
some of these,

01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:58.770
when you're studying this
monument,

01:09:58.770 --> 01:10:02.288
you will see that there are
some figures--

01:10:02.288 --> 01:10:03.880
while for the most part it
makes sense--

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.520
there are some figures in this
crowded scene that don't work.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.082
For example,
here's a figure on the ground,

01:10:10.082 --> 01:10:13.377
with a shield above his head,
trying to protect himself

01:10:13.377 --> 01:10:15.270
obviously from a combatant.
 

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:16.930
But there is no combatant there.
 

01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.663
And that seems to underscore
again that they are using copy

01:10:19.663 --> 01:10:21.880
books, that they are looking at
these things.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:23.380
They're copying what they like.
 

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:25.547
They're copying the scene for
the most part,

01:10:25.547 --> 01:10:27.817
throwing in some other figures
that they like,

01:10:27.817 --> 01:10:30.439
that don't--sometimes don't
even make any sense.

01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:32.622
A detail up here of the
tholos,

01:10:32.622 --> 01:10:33.979
with the two statues.
 

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:38.301
I spent about six weeks at this
monument at one point,

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:39.850
in that area at St.
 

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:44.578
Rêmy, in a little place
near Les Antiques.

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:48.362
And I remember when I was there
that there was this wonderful

01:10:48.362 --> 01:10:51.198
headline in the local newspaper
that said--

01:10:51.198 --> 01:10:53.930
there was a huge storm,
with lightening and so on,

01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:56.826
and the next morning there was
a headline that said "Has

01:10:56.826 --> 01:10:58.948
Gaius Lost His
Head?" Because the

01:10:58.948 --> 01:11:01.460
locals want to believe that this
is a monument,

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.198
not of local army veterans,
but of the Augustan family,

01:11:04.198 --> 01:11:07.626
and that the two figures at the
uppermost part were Gaius and

01:11:07.626 --> 01:11:08.538
Lucius Caesar.
 

01:11:08.538 --> 01:11:10.761
Well they were not Gaius and
Lucius Caesar,

01:11:10.761 --> 01:11:12.189
they were local veterans.
 

01:11:12.189 --> 01:11:16.720
But nonetheless the myth has
continued on.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.380
I want to show you lastly,
for just the minute or so that

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.615
remains,
to try to underscore that

01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:26.314
point, that the north of Italy
may have been a source for this

01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:28.497
kind of tower tomb that we see
at St.

01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:31.470
Rêmy, just by showing you
one example.

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.853
It's by no means exactly the
same, but it's the best that I

01:11:34.853 --> 01:11:38.470
can do, because most of these
tower tombs no longer survive.

01:11:38.470 --> 01:11:41.631
But it is a tholos tomb
from Aquileia,

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:45.439
in the north of Italy that
dates to the early Augustan

01:11:45.439 --> 01:11:46.229
period.
 

01:11:46.229 --> 01:11:49.670
And you can see that it has a
large base,

01:11:49.670 --> 01:11:52.908
with a figural sculptural
decoration here--

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.488
this Isles of the Blessed kind
of imagery--

01:11:55.488 --> 01:11:58.920
with a tholos at the top
that includes a statue,

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.805
and then a pyramidal roof with
a decorative element at the

01:12:03.805 --> 01:12:06.918
uppermost part,
and then, as you can see,

01:12:06.918 --> 01:12:10.118
some lion statues out in front
to guard that tomb.

01:12:10.118 --> 01:12:13.408
It's by no means the same thing
as what I've shown you,

01:12:13.408 --> 01:12:15.984
but it gives you an idea that
these kind of tholos

01:12:15.984 --> 01:12:17.804
tombs,
on decorated bases,

01:12:17.804 --> 01:12:20.538
were popular in the north of
Italy,

01:12:20.538 --> 01:12:26.123
and the idea may have made its
way to the south of France via

01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:29.010
these north Italian examples.
 

01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:31.680
And lastly, just one last
monument,

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.560
because we've tended to be
looking at tombs in isolation,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.470
individual tombs,
rather than tomb complexes,

01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:41.222
because it's the individual
tombs and not the complexes

01:12:41.222 --> 01:12:43.109
themselves that are well
preserved.

01:12:43.109 --> 01:12:46.539
But I want to show you one
excellent example from the north

01:12:46.539 --> 01:12:49.309
of Italy,
again from this wonderful town

01:12:49.309 --> 01:12:52.466
called Aquileia:
an early Augustan set of altar

01:12:52.466 --> 01:12:56.515
tombs that are still preserved
in the actual original burial

01:12:56.515 --> 01:12:58.555
plots,
which gives you a very good

01:12:58.555 --> 01:13:01.078
idea of what one of these plots
would have looked like.

01:13:01.078 --> 01:13:04.105
These are, of course,
not monumental tombs but small

01:13:04.105 --> 01:13:06.479
tomb markers in the shapes of
altars,

01:13:06.479 --> 01:13:11.908
and then other smaller items,
as you can see very well here.

01:13:11.908 --> 01:13:14.880
But it shows you the way in
which the Romans had,

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.798
just as one has today,
these burial plots for the

01:13:17.798 --> 01:13:20.050
family: these family burial
plots,

01:13:20.050 --> 01:13:23.679
that have individual markers of
different family members in

01:13:23.679 --> 01:13:26.873
them,
and then has a kind of stone

01:13:26.873 --> 01:13:31.300
fence that encircles and
protects their plot.

01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:33.609
And you can see that stone
fence down here,

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:36.935
a stone fence that should
immediately remind you of some

01:13:36.935 --> 01:13:40.382
of the stone fences that we saw
in Second Style Roman wall

01:13:40.382 --> 01:13:42.042
painting,
for example;

01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:46.038
that were omnipresent in Second
Style Roman wall painting.

01:13:46.038 --> 01:13:48.277
And the last point I'll make
today is just to

01:13:48.277 --> 01:13:50.717
underscore--once again,
I think there are lots of

01:13:50.717 --> 01:13:52.659
examples of it today;
the tholoi,

01:13:52.659 --> 01:13:53.890
for example,
the tholos,

01:13:53.890 --> 01:13:56.761
and these fences,
as well as the theatrical

01:13:56.761 --> 01:14:01.101
architecture we saw at Orange--
that underscore once again the

01:14:01.101 --> 01:14:04.850
close association between
architecture and painting,

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:08.969
from the Republic,
all the way up to the Augustan

01:14:08.969 --> 01:14:11.310
age,
and still beyond.

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.359
Thank you all.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.070
Prof: Okay,
let's get going.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.602
This first slide really is just
an update on the content of my

00:00:06.602 --> 00:00:08.977
lecture last time,
and it actually has two

00:00:08.977 --> 00:00:11.107
messages;
there's the direct message and

00:00:11.107 --> 00:00:12.530
then there's the meta-message.
 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.678
Andrea interpreted my lecture
last time as me making the claim

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:22.151
that parents usually don't
intervene in fights between

00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:23.840
their offspring.
 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.633
And so she had this nice paper
that she'd read on hyenas that

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.984
showed that actually mother
hyenas do intervene in the

00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:33.450
squabbles between the baby
hyenas,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.518
and that they do so probably
because in some seasons they're

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:38.390
actually able to get enough
food--

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.450
if there are twins born,
say that are sisters,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.483
that are fighting with each
other in the first week of

00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:44.500
life--
to actually rear both of them.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.680
And that's an important
qualification.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.400
So I want you all to know about
it.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.690
But the meta-message is this.
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.620
I really appreciate being
informed about things like this.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.312
I have to cover an incredibly
broad range of biology in this

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:02.191
course, and I can't read all of
the latest literature in all of

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:02.630
it.
 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.799
And so if any of you feel
moved, by the work that you have

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.176
done on your papers,
to increase my knowledge by

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:13.370
sending in a little qualifier on
one of my lectures,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.010
I would be delighted to receive
it;

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.549
then my lectures next time
around will be a little bit more

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.159
current.
 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:19.739
So.
 

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:21.450
Student:  Can you check
your microphone?

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.180
Is it on or off?
 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.370
Prof: Open to all kinds
of criticism.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.620
&gt;
 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.268
Okay, today we're going to talk
about alternative breeding

00:01:34.268 --> 00:01:35.099
strategies.
 

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:38.983
And I asked Alex actually to
come up with one of his

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:43.905
incredibly neat videos today,
and he had trouble on YouTube,

00:01:43.905 --> 00:01:47.751
and other places,
finding a really neat video of

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.010
alternative breeding strategies,
in males.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.550
You'll see some slides.
 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.530
They are dramatic,
and they really are all focused

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.266
around one basic idea,
and I just want to show-

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.108
indicate that at the beginning.
 

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:06.132
And it's actually in the
simplest example,

00:02:06.132 --> 00:02:08.050
in the bullfrog example.
 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.250
Okay?
 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.433
And the whole issue of having
an alternative breeding strategy

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.110
revolves around frequency
dependence.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.933
So the usual scenario is that
at some point in the

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:28.353
evolutionary past a male has
achieved a dominant mating

00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:32.045
status,
and that sexual selection has

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:36.970
then driven the evolution of his
behavior and his morphology--

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.514
the mating system,
polygeny, polyandry,

00:02:41.514 --> 00:02:44.186
whatever;
in which case it would be a

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.900
female who would achieve the
dominant mating status--

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.208
so that there was a focal pair,
and that that biology got

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.440
pushed to a certain degree.
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.247
But once it evolved,
it created the opportunity for

00:02:58.247 --> 00:02:59.690
alternatives.
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.788
And so that's the theme of the
whole lecture;

00:03:01.788 --> 00:03:05.639
okay, it's alternative ways of
getting a mating.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:09.629
And as you'll see there are
quite a few issues that are

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.990
interesting, and it covers a
pretty broad range of different

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.688
kinds of organisms.
 

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:18.720
So this is the paradigmatic
example.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.658
And this often happens in
various kinds of frogs,

00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:25.870
not just bullfrogs,
that the male calls,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.389
the female hears the male
calling, moves toward the pond,

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.495
and the male will then grasp
the female with incredibly

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.530
strong forearms.
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.794
And if any of you are
interested in frogs,

00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:43.943
or had one in your pocket,
you may have noticed that males

00:03:43.943 --> 00:03:46.210
have different forearms than
females.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.887
They really have Popeye the
Sailorman, bulked up,

00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:53.565
steroid forearms,
and once they get onto a female

00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:57.318
it's actually extremely hard to
pry them off.

00:03:57.318 --> 00:03:59.652
You might be two hundred times
their weight,

00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.799
but boy they are hard to get
off, and that's because that's

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.348
where all of their reproductive
success is.

00:04:05.348 --> 00:04:08.835
If they can stay locked onto
her when she releases her eggs,

00:04:08.835 --> 00:04:10.430
they will get the babies.
 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.673
Of course what then happens is
that a small male will jump on,

00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:20.879
on top of the large male.
 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.579
If a small male gets onto the
female first,

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:27.439
the large male will grab both
of them and practically squeeze

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.240
the small male to death.
 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.045
Now the point of this is that
the behavior of the dominant

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:37.512
male,
and the female who's attracted

00:04:37.512 --> 00:04:40.848
to him,
created the opportunity for the

00:04:40.848 --> 00:04:44.509
alternative behavior of the
small male.

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:50.226
If that hadn't already been
there, the alterative wouldn't

00:04:50.226 --> 00:04:51.029
exist.
 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.927
In the spring in the meadow
that was behind our house in

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:57.601
Switzerland,
when the male frogs started

00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:00.410
calling in the pond in our
neighbor's garden,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.490
and the females started coming
down through the meadow,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.649
the male frogs that were
waiting for the females to move

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:09.408
by would jump onto them,
and then the females would have

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:10.850
to carry those guys on their
backs,

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.689
around 100 meters,
to get to the pond;

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:16.471
during which time,
you know, other frogs would be

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:17.629
trying to jump on.
 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.976
So it's a very--part of the
intensity of this is driven by

00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:24.339
the ephemerality of the pond.
 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.394
If it weren't the case that the
pond was only going to be there

00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:29.851
for a little while,
and only really suitable for

00:05:29.851 --> 00:05:31.810
raising baby frogs for a little
while,

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.389
it wouldn't be so intense.
 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.730
But that's the case,
and it is incredibly intense.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.105
It all happens in a period of
about twenty-four to forty-eight

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:40.680
hours.
 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.927
Now a similar kind of
alternative--well similar in the

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.459
abstract sense;
a similar alternative mating

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.870
strategy has evolved in figs and
fig wasps.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.684
And figs and fig wasps are one
of the wonders of ecology and

00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:56.459
evolution.
 

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:01.982
There are--I don't want to be
precise because in fact I don't

00:06:01.982 --> 00:06:04.100
think we really know.
 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.139
But let's say there are more
than 500 species of figs in the

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.290
world--many of them in tropical
rainforests;

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.596
many of them critical
ecological resources providing

00:06:14.596 --> 00:06:18.290
food throughout seasons when
other trees are not providing

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.048
food--
and each one of these species

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:25.785
of figs,
in general, has its own fig

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:30.129
wasp, and if it didn't have that
fig wasp,

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:32.040
it couldn't get pollinated.
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:37.824
So what's going on here is that
the figs are sacrificing some of

00:06:37.824 --> 00:06:43.060
their own seeds to raise the
wasps that pollinate them.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.161
And this clearly has evolved
from an ancestral situation in

00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:53.000
which the wasps were actually
parasitizing the figs,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.377
and ripping them off,
but now has evolved into a

00:06:56.377 --> 00:07:00.689
mutualistic and very complicated
mutualistic relationship.

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.060
The strategies of both the figs
and the wasps vary.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.559
You'll see in a minute that
sometimes the figs are

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:10.649
monoecious, sometimes they're
diecious;

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.783
in other words,
sometimes they are producing

00:07:12.783 --> 00:07:15.413
fruits that only have male
flowers or only have female

00:07:15.413 --> 00:07:18.240
flowers,
and sometimes they're producing

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.319
fruits that have both kinds of
flowers in the same fruit.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:27.117
And the wasps have really
highly differentiated strategies

00:07:27.117 --> 00:07:32.170
that depend on whether they're
copulating inside the fig,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.851
outside the fig,
and so forth,

00:07:33.851 --> 00:07:37.158
and sometimes you get both
kinds of strategies in the same

00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:38.319
species of wasp.
 

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:42.785
So here's a fig,
and here are some of the wasps

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:45.600
that would be living on it.
 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.790
And this is about how big they
are.

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:49.690
Okay?
 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.500
So they're pretty small.
 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.319
And in fact if you've gone to a
nice organic store,

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.970
and you have eaten figs from a
nice organic store,

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.473
there is a certain probability
that you've increased your

00:08:01.473 --> 00:08:05.141
protein intake,
and you probably haven't even

00:08:05.141 --> 00:08:05.930
noticed.
 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:13.379
Now, the figs can make either
long or short styled flowers.

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:19.480
And what that means is that
they are making flowers which

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:26.019
are going to be targeted by fig
wasps, or not targeted by fig

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:29.069
wasps, for their babies.
 

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:33.779
And if we--if you work through
this diagram,

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:38.251
you'll see that the figs that
have long styled flowers are

00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:42.432
going to be getting pollinated,
and there aren't going to be

00:08:42.432 --> 00:08:44.110
any larvae developing on them.
 

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.259
These are the ones that are
going to make new figs.

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.389
Okay?
 

00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:50.881
And the figs that make short
styled flowers are going to be

00:08:50.881 --> 00:08:53.735
chosen--in this species of fig;
this isn't for all,

00:08:53.735 --> 00:08:55.970
but this is for one of the 600
species of figs--

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.830
they will be chosen by the wasp
that will oviposit in them,

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.110
and the wasps will eclose.
 

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.817
They will mate;
in many cases they will mate

00:09:05.817 --> 00:09:09.943
inside the fig,
and then when the females leave

00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:12.916
the fig,
the timing of the fig's flower

00:09:12.916 --> 00:09:17.227
maturation is such that as the
females force their way out of a

00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:19.945
narrow aperture,
there are flowers bearing

00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:22.649
pollen right next to that
aperture on the inside,

00:09:22.649 --> 00:09:26.807
and the female takes them out,
and then she flies off to

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:30.634
oviposit in another fig,
which is how the pollination is

00:09:30.634 --> 00:09:31.210
achieved.
 

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:35.259
So they had to set up two
separate ways of making seeds;

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:40.000
the ones that the wasps would
use and the ones that would make

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.090
future figs.
 

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.669
Other fig species have
partitioned this in other ways.

00:09:43.669 --> 00:09:44.908
Okay?
 

00:09:44.908 --> 00:09:48.369
So there's an interesting
complexity of evolution that's

00:09:48.369 --> 00:09:50.320
gone on in this relationship.
 

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.726
Now the alternative mating
strategies are that there will

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:56.158
be fighting males or dispersing
males.

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.250
You don't need to pay too much
attention to this;

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.897
this just shows that the more
winged males there are,

00:10:00.897 --> 00:10:03.850
the more females get mated by a
winged male, that's all.

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.990
But there is a frequency
dependent thing going on inside

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.830
one of those figs,
as the males are hatching out.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.538
If they fight with each other
and kill each other,

00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:21.080
then the survivor will be the
only male who is in that fig,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.889
or one of the few males in that
fig,

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:26.710
who can mate with the females
that are coming out.

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.658
So there is--you know,
if you commit to that strategy,

00:10:29.658 --> 00:10:34.000
you are committing to an
extremely aggressive,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.928
live by the sword die by the
sword,

00:10:35.928 --> 00:10:38.322
kind of existence,
and it all gets carried out in

00:10:38.322 --> 00:10:40.874
a dark little fig,
and you're just waiting for the

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:43.690
first female to hatch out so
that you can mate with her,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.149
and you get as many as you can,
and then you never fly,

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:47.669
because you don't have any
wings.

00:10:47.669 --> 00:10:49.019
You die in the fig.
 

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:53.418
So that's your protein intake;
it's dead males.

00:10:53.418 --> 00:10:56.605
On the other hand a certain
number of the females are going

00:10:56.605 --> 00:11:00.009
to manage to get out of the fig
without being mated inside,

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:02.840
and if you can go out and find
them,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.000
outside, then you don't have to
commit to fighting.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.581
However, there are very strong
morphological tradeoffs between

00:11:09.581 --> 00:11:11.110
the two kinds of things.
 

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.644
You can't do both well;
so you're committing to doing

00:11:13.644 --> 00:11:14.840
one or the other well.
 

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.308
And how much each pays depends
on the local biology.

00:11:20.308 --> 00:11:23.229
How likely is it that the
female will be able to get out

00:11:23.229 --> 00:11:25.732
of a seed,
an eclose, and get her wings

00:11:25.732 --> 00:11:28.186
ready to go,
and get out of there before one

00:11:28.186 --> 00:11:30.629
of these fighting males comes
over and gets her?

00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:33.798
So that's what creates the
frequency dependence.

00:11:33.798 --> 00:11:37.690
And you can see these things
are radically morphologically

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:39.668
different from one another.
 

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:43.419
This is a case in which the
alternative reproductive tactics

00:11:43.419 --> 00:11:47.297
are really resulting in changes
that you could just pick up by

00:11:47.297 --> 00:11:48.950
looking at the things.
 

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.629
You might need a hand glass to
see it very clearly,

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:54.629
because these guys are down
about one millimeter long.

00:11:54.629 --> 00:12:00.440
But it has resulted in major
morphological change.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.886
And, by the way,
these, from an evo-devo

00:12:02.886 --> 00:12:06.337
perspective, this is neat
because all of these forms are

00:12:06.337 --> 00:12:09.350
elicited essentially from the
same genotype.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:11.269
These guys are haploid;
these are the males.

00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:13.538
This is the female;
she's diploid.

00:12:13.538 --> 00:12:16.980
Otherwise they have the same
genotype,

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.650
and these alternatives here are
probably being determined just

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.649
by one autosomal locus with two
alleles,

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:30.543
that are determining whether or
not you are a type that flies

00:12:30.543 --> 00:12:33.788
out of the nest or stays in the
nest and fights.

00:12:33.788 --> 00:12:38.046
And you can see that the female
is equipped with really a

00:12:38.046 --> 00:12:42.378
beautiful, exquisitely long
ovipositor to get her egg into

00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:43.669
the fig seed.
 

00:12:43.669 --> 00:12:45.168
Okay.
 

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:50.519
So we've seen that bullfrogs
and fig wasps--the bullfrog

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:54.408
biology is relatively
straightforward;

00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:58.548
the fig wasp biology is almost
arbitrarily complex.

00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:03.164
But they both create situations
in which alternative male mating

00:13:03.164 --> 00:13:04.850
tactics are possible.
 

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:10.428
And the thing that drives that
is that there is a very well

00:13:10.428 --> 00:13:13.339
developed,
evolved, prior biology,

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:17.378
that means an alternative has
an opportunity to insinuate

00:13:17.378 --> 00:13:18.100
itself.
 

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.052
You can think of the
alternatives as being parasites

00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:23.990
on the prior condition.
 

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:29.395
Now, there is probably no group
of organisms in which the

00:13:29.395 --> 00:13:35.188
diversity of mating tactics and
parental styles has been more

00:13:35.188 --> 00:13:39.918
broadly and diversely developed
than in fish.

00:13:39.918 --> 00:13:44.361
If you're interested in this
stuff, the fish hold more

00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:49.558
material for investigation than
practically any other group.

00:13:49.558 --> 00:13:53.596
A survey of alternate male
mating tactics in fish came up

00:13:53.596 --> 00:13:57.293
with these kinds of definitions,
and I want to run through them

00:13:57.293 --> 00:13:59.268
for a moment,
just so you have those words

00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:00.259
clear in your head.
 

00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:04.668
So there are three different
kinds of parasitic male

00:14:04.668 --> 00:14:06.830
reproductive behaviors.
 

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:11.755
So the sneakers are using speed
or stealth to get access to a

00:14:11.755 --> 00:14:12.658
spawning.
 

00:14:12.658 --> 00:14:15.269
So they don't necessarily look
like a female.

00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:17.716
They just kind of hang back,
let the spawning start,

00:14:17.716 --> 00:14:18.870
and then they whip in.
 

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:22.625
The female mimics actually
deceive the territorial or

00:14:22.625 --> 00:14:26.886
guarding males into thinking
that they are something to mate

00:14:26.886 --> 00:14:29.562
with,
and then a female comes in and

00:14:29.562 --> 00:14:33.142
when she spawns the female
mimics then reveal their true

00:14:33.142 --> 00:14:35.740
colors and release sperm,
rather than eggs;

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.058
surprise, surprise.
 

00:14:37.058 --> 00:14:41.515
And the pirate males are males
that steal fertilization by

00:14:41.515 --> 00:14:43.080
being big bullies.
 

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.025
So they let some other guy do
all the work of cleaning a

00:14:46.025 --> 00:14:49.187
territory and setting up a nest
and going through all of the

00:14:49.187 --> 00:14:51.918
trouble of displaying and
attracting a female,

00:14:51.918 --> 00:14:54.110
and then just as she arrives
they whip in,

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.100
and because they're bigger and
tougher they push him out.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.419
So that's a pirate.
 

00:14:58.419 --> 00:14:59.320
Okay?
 

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.740
Now there are also cooperative
male reproductive behaviors.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:10.658
Satellite males can display and
can contribute to territorial

00:15:10.658 --> 00:15:13.418
defense and parental care.
 

00:15:13.418 --> 00:15:19.948
And so we don't have to view
this as strictly a short-term,

00:15:19.948 --> 00:15:23.440
selfish kind of exploitation.
 

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:26.129
There can be cooperative mating
going on,

00:15:26.129 --> 00:15:29.820
and it will stabilize if it's
really win-win,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.404
so that everybody in it is
winning something from the

00:15:33.404 --> 00:15:34.370
interaction.
 

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:38.360
So if you just look at these
morphologies,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.907
the satellites,
the sneakers and the mimics are

00:15:40.907 --> 00:15:43.509
usually lacking sexually
selected ornaments,

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:47.440
and the guards and the pirates
usually have such ornaments.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.000
Okay?
 

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.788
So the pirates kind of look
like the guards.

00:15:49.788 --> 00:15:52.907
They're not so much
morphologically differentiated

00:15:52.907 --> 00:15:55.580
as they are behaviorally
differentiated.

00:15:59.168 --> 00:16:02.450
This is a phylogenetic
distribution of these

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.120
alternative reproductive
tactics.

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.500
And the white is group spawning;
the grey is mate

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:14.320
monopolization,
with no alternatives reported;

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.070
the stripes are an equivocal,
unresolved ancestral state;

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.385
and the black ones are the
alternative male reproductive

00:16:22.385 --> 00:16:22.990
tactics.
 

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.389
Now you can see that there have
been quite a few.

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:28.809
I can read off--you can't
probably see all of this,

00:16:28.809 --> 00:16:32.120
but those are cyprinids there;
some of those have alternative

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.649
tactics.
 

00:16:32.649 --> 00:16:34.798
Some gobies have alternative
tactics.

00:16:34.798 --> 00:16:37.668
The wrasses here are in the
Labridae.

00:16:37.668 --> 00:16:41.258
But there are some alternative
reproductive tactics in the

00:16:41.258 --> 00:16:42.769
cichlids and so forth.
 

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:44.408
You can see--the interesting
thing,

00:16:44.408 --> 00:16:47.038
and the take-home point from
that picture is hey,

00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:49.684
fish do a lot of different
things, and they have

00:16:49.684 --> 00:16:52.779
independently converged on
alternative male reproductive

00:16:52.779 --> 00:16:56.732
tactics multiple times;
which you can see from the fact

00:16:56.732 --> 00:17:00.500
that the black is spottily
distributed across the

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.149
phylogenetic tree.
 

00:17:02.149 --> 00:17:06.510
Now if you go through that tree
and you analyze it--we assume

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:10.509
that we're usually starting from
mate monopolization;

00:17:10.509 --> 00:17:13.150
so a guarding male and one
female.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.720
And then you ask yourself,
well what happens from that?

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.806
And it looks like out of that
ancestral state there has been

00:17:19.806 --> 00:17:22.298
some evolution of group
spawning,

00:17:22.298 --> 00:17:24.563
and there's been some
transition from that back

00:17:24.563 --> 00:17:26.038
through mate monopolization.
 

00:17:26.038 --> 00:17:28.952
There seems to have been some
move from group spawning

00:17:28.952 --> 00:17:31.808
directly over to alternative
reproductive tactics.

00:17:31.808 --> 00:17:37.239
And if we take a closer look at
where you go into alternative

00:17:37.239 --> 00:17:41.943
reproductive tactics,
it looks like the most frequent

00:17:41.943 --> 00:17:44.838
one is that sneakers pop up.
 

00:17:44.838 --> 00:17:48.622
That seems to be the easiest,
at least the most frequent

00:17:48.622 --> 00:17:50.410
evolutionary transition.
 

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.473
And from sneakers,
or from mate monopolization,

00:17:53.473 --> 00:17:57.269
you can get female mimics;
you can get satellite males.

00:17:57.269 --> 00:17:58.548
So this is the cooperative one.
 

00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:01.250
And then the pirates are not so
common.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.123
So I'm going to step through a
case which is pretty well

00:18:09.123 --> 00:18:10.019
analyzed.
 

00:18:10.019 --> 00:18:14.078
It's in one way more
complicated than the simple

00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:19.346
situation, and in another way,
in terms of the kinds of things

00:18:19.346 --> 00:18:22.368
you can measure,
rather simple.

00:18:22.368 --> 00:18:25.717
So this is a wrasse that lives
in the Mediterranean,

00:18:25.717 --> 00:18:28.211
and Suzanne Alonzo,
in this department,

00:18:28.211 --> 00:18:29.786
studied it for her Ph.D.
 

00:18:29.786 --> 00:18:31.690
thesis and her post-doc.
 

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:33.690
And Suzanne gave me these
slides.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.001
It is a case in which the
nesting males are providing

00:18:38.001 --> 00:18:40.788
parental care;
so the guarding males,

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:41.650
if you like.
 

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:42.769
They are the ones that build
the nest.

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:46.741
There are smaller non-nesting
males that come in and sneak

00:18:46.741 --> 00:18:47.369
spawns.
 

00:18:47.369 --> 00:18:49.180
A nest takes about ten days.
 

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.730
So you can go out and get a
pretty good sample.

00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:54.230
You can fly over to Corsica,
put on your wetsuit,

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:55.880
get in the water,
stay there for three months,

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.160
you're going to go through a
whole bunch of nesting cycles.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.135
About one-third of all nests
are deserted,

00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:05.693
and they can be deserted either
because there's an

00:19:05.693 --> 00:19:09.470
intra-specific or an
inter-specific interaction.

00:19:09.470 --> 00:19:14.059
And it is the females that
choose spawning situations.

00:19:14.059 --> 00:19:14.598
Okay?
 

00:19:14.598 --> 00:19:16.818
They're not really choosing
males or territories;

00:19:16.818 --> 00:19:21.964
they're choosing to go into a
situation in which they see one

00:19:21.964 --> 00:19:25.567
male, many males,
a certain kind of general

00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:28.569
topography, that kind of thing.
 

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:32.200
So this is Suzanne.
 

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:38.490
This is a male on his nest,
and he is nesting in algae.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.150
Okay?
 

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:43.702
So this is a big mat of algae,
and he has cleared out a hole

00:19:43.702 --> 00:19:44.318
in it.
 

00:19:44.318 --> 00:19:49.670
This is a female,
and the nest is below her.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.779
By the way, these guys are
about that big.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:57.519
And here's a bunch of female
mimics.

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:03.795
And often if you go to a
nesting site you will see oh

00:20:03.795 --> 00:20:10.068
anywhere from two to ten of
these, hanging around.

00:20:10.068 --> 00:20:14.720
So one of the questions you can
ask yourself--and this is where

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:19.519
Suzanne used evolutionary game
theory in kind of a simple way;

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:24.585
it's pretty much a cost-benefit
analysis--should you guard or

00:20:24.585 --> 00:20:26.190
should you sneak?
 

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.387
In other words,
should you invest your energy

00:20:29.387 --> 00:20:32.949
in guarding your nest and in
guarding your female,

00:20:32.949 --> 00:20:37.019
or should you try to increase
your sperm production?

00:20:37.019 --> 00:20:37.630
Okay?
 

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.788
So that's the basic assumption.
 

00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:42.048
Either it's guarding or it's
sperm production.

00:20:42.048 --> 00:20:45.289
If you guard,
one assumes that's decreasing

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.759
the risk of sperm competition.
 

00:20:47.759 --> 00:20:51.368
If you do get into the sperm
production racket,

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:54.298
then it's thought to be a fair
lottery,

00:20:54.298 --> 00:20:57.882
which means that the
probability of a fertilization

00:20:57.882 --> 00:21:02.467
is just directly proportional to
what frequency your sperm are in

00:21:02.467 --> 00:21:05.618
the pool of sperm that's being
produced.

00:21:05.618 --> 00:21:09.183
And these fish have external
fertilization,

00:21:09.183 --> 00:21:14.444
so you can pretty much estimate
that by analyzing a sample of a

00:21:14.444 --> 00:21:18.009
cloud of sperm produced at a
spawning.

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:22.576
The guarding males don't know
if they're in sperm competition,

00:21:22.576 --> 00:21:26.019
because the female mimics look
like females.

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:26.868
Okay?
 

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:30.075
So the male is guarding and he
thinks he may have a number of

00:21:30.075 --> 00:21:32.640
females around him,
and it's hard for him to know

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.509
whether they're females or not.
 

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:38.200
That's not true of the female
mimics;

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.210
they know that they're going to
be in sperm competition.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.749
So this just gives you an
example of how a behavioral

00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:45.849
ecologist would think about that
problem.

00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:46.390
Okay?
 

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.830
You do a Cartesian reduction,
you break it down into its

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.434
elements,
and you write down what would

00:21:53.434 --> 00:21:56.650
be your reproductive success if
you were guarding mates.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.200
Well there would be some risk
of sperm competition.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.797
There would be the amount of
sperm that you as the guarder

00:22:01.797 --> 00:22:02.798
produced per mating.
 

00:22:02.798 --> 00:22:05.598
There would be the sperm from
other males.

00:22:05.598 --> 00:22:11.319
Just this is the assumption of
equal frequency.

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:11.769
Okay?
 

00:22:11.769 --> 00:22:15.040
So this is the proportion of
eggs you'll get if you do that,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:18.588
and this is the probability of
no sperm competition over here.

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.440
So that's your reproductive
success.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.151
If there's no sperm
competition, you'll get them

00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:22.368
all.
 

00:22:22.368 --> 00:22:25.828
If there is sperm competition,
you'll get this proportion.

00:22:25.828 --> 00:22:28.508
And if you look at it--if
you're allocating the sperm

00:22:28.508 --> 00:22:30.883
production,
which is what you might be

00:22:30.883 --> 00:22:33.490
concentrating on if you were a
sneaker,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:37.087
well this would be your risk;
proportion fertilized,

00:22:37.087 --> 00:22:39.789
probability of no sperm
competition and so forth.

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:40.640
Okay?
 

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:45.416
So basically if you're a
guarder, and you're considering

00:22:45.416 --> 00:22:51.150
the allocation within your own
body to these two possibilities,

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.832
you just ask,
"When am I going to get

00:22:52.832 --> 00:22:55.087
more out of guarding than I am
going to get out of sperm

00:22:55.087 --> 00:22:55.950
production?"
 

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.471
And that simplifies to this;
which is that the relative cost

00:22:59.471 --> 00:23:02.512
of mate guarding has got to be
smaller than the relative cost

00:23:02.512 --> 00:23:03.680
of sperm production.
 

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:10.057
So that's the--I just--this is
presented actually not to have

00:23:10.057 --> 00:23:14.500
you try to write down equations,
or replicate them,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.380
or think that they're going to
be on the test.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:21.891
It is presented to show you
that when you approach a new

00:23:21.891 --> 00:23:25.598
problem you use very simple
logic,

00:23:25.598 --> 00:23:27.720
and you try to keep it as
simple as you can,

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.563
and you just try to see if
there might be any surprises

00:23:32.563 --> 00:23:36.328
that arise from using very
simple logic.

00:23:36.328 --> 00:23:40.222
And I hope that that is a
motivating comment,

00:23:40.222 --> 00:23:45.534
because you can actually get
quite far in these circumstances

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:48.720
just by using very simple logic.
 

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.019
You don't have to think that
scientific research is based on

00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:57.538
things that are so technically
obtuse that you won't be able to

00:23:57.538 --> 00:23:59.068
see through them.
 

00:23:59.068 --> 00:24:02.308
So to get back to our fish,
back from the algebra to the

00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:05.606
fish, the nesting males don't
know if they'll be in sperm

00:24:05.606 --> 00:24:06.548
competition.
 

00:24:06.548 --> 00:24:09.214
The female mimics know they're
always going to be in sperm

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:09.868
competition.
 

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:13.660
And the fertilization rates are
about 100%.

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.108
So the nesting males are able
to reduce their risk of sperm

00:24:17.108 --> 00:24:19.250
competition through mate
guarding.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.950
And there really is evidence.
 

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.278
This is the proportion of
spawns that are snuck;

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:27.890
this is the number of mimicking
males at the nest.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.940
And the number of--if you just
go out there,

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.250
you know, with your mask and
snorkel,

00:24:33.250 --> 00:24:35.529
and you're writing down how
many males are at the nest,

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:38.731
what this kind of work does is
it tells you that the number of

00:24:38.731 --> 00:24:41.987
males that you see at the nest
actually is a rough predictor of

00:24:41.987 --> 00:24:45.618
the amount of sperm competition,
which is going on.

00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:51.266
And the proportion of spawns
which are actually successfully

00:24:51.266 --> 00:24:57.008
snuck does increase with the
number of mimicking males at the

00:24:57.008 --> 00:24:57.868
nest.
 

00:24:57.868 --> 00:25:00.730
Okay, so what's going on with
sperm competition?

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:07.410
Well this is sperm per spawn,
times a million.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:09.828
And if there's just--and
you--by the way,

00:25:09.828 --> 00:25:11.848
the way that you do this is you
watch the spawn,

00:25:11.848 --> 00:25:15.440
and you go down there with a
sampling device,

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.813
which is a plastic tube,
that will take in a liter or so

00:25:18.813 --> 00:25:20.962
of water,
and you put the mouth into the

00:25:20.962 --> 00:25:22.957
middle of the spawn,
and you suck in a sample,

00:25:22.957 --> 00:25:25.630
and then you take it back,
spin it down and analyze it.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:27.410
So that's how you get the data.
 

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.732
If a pair is spawning,
the male has produced

00:25:30.732 --> 00:25:34.920
relatively little sperm,
and if there are sneakers that

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.681
are going in--
so this is a pair plus one

00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:40.136
sneaker--
this is the additional amount

00:25:40.136 --> 00:25:43.048
of sperm that he is putting into
the spawning.

00:25:43.048 --> 00:25:47.012
So he has obviously taken
advantage of the fact that he

00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:51.490
doesn't have to put energy into
guarding, and he has allocated

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.180
that into spawning.
 

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:59.896
However, because of the
behavior and the dominance of

00:25:59.896 --> 00:26:03.276
the guarding male,
who is larger,

00:26:03.276 --> 00:26:05.608
he is usually able to get
closer to the female,

00:26:05.608 --> 00:26:10.528
and in fact he is actually
getting more offspring out of

00:26:10.528 --> 00:26:15.088
his 1.5 million sperm than the
sneaker is out of his

00:26:15.088 --> 00:26:18.130
approximately 5 million sperm.
 

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:26.269
So these males are actually
getting well paid by investing

00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:30.588
in guarding, rather than
allocating the sperm.

00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:34.349
And the model is predicting
that mate guarding should lead

00:26:34.349 --> 00:26:37.962
to higher success;
that's by an analysis that

00:26:37.962 --> 00:26:42.640
actually includes more data than
I have put up here.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.192
So the sneakers are essentially
males that are making the best

00:26:46.192 --> 00:26:48.404
of a bad job,
and they suffer from high

00:26:48.404 --> 00:26:50.210
variance in mating success.
 

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.349
So they try,
and they go from one male to

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:55.828
another, and they try repeatedly
over the course of the season.

00:26:55.828 --> 00:26:58.971
And the percentage of eggs
they're able to fertilize is

00:26:58.971 --> 00:27:01.588
going up and down a lot with
each spawning;

00:27:01.588 --> 00:27:06.720
whereas the guarding males are
getting less variance and a

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:12.118
better geometric mean of total
eggs fertilized throughout the

00:27:12.118 --> 00:27:13.920
spawning season.
 

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.170
Now that's an interesting view
of the world,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.994
and I think that it's the basic
view of the world that comes out

00:27:21.994 --> 00:27:26.436
of almost every analysis of
frequency dependence using game

00:27:26.436 --> 00:27:27.278
theory.
 

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:33.348
It is a world in which there
isn't an optimal solution.

00:27:33.348 --> 00:27:36.529
It's a world in which there are
losers.

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:38.940
It's a world in which there is
conflict.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:43.628
And certainly this is a mating
system in which long-term

00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:47.038
conflict is always going to be
there,

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:51.970
and it's basically because the
more guarders there are,

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.160
the more opportunities there
are for sneakers;

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.705
and the more sneakers there
are, the lower the mating

00:27:57.705 --> 00:28:00.230
success of sneakers is going to
be.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:02.857
So they will always be
maintained at intermediate

00:28:02.857 --> 00:28:04.940
frequency and they'll never go
away.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.829
It's a nice habitat.
 

00:28:06.829 --> 00:28:08.750
The water is pretty clear.
 

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:11.920
It's fairly chilly.
 

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.950
It's about 18 to 20 degrees
Centigrade.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:20.050
So it's not the warmest place
in the world to work,

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.538
but it's good clear water for
observation.

00:28:24.538 --> 00:28:30.207
Now one of the interesting
parts of behavioral ecology that

00:28:30.207 --> 00:28:36.265
has received a lot of emphasis
in the last- increasingly in the

00:28:36.265 --> 00:28:42.029
last twenty years is the
behavioral ecology of gametes.

00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:45.622
So what's actually going on
when we consider the alternative

00:28:45.622 --> 00:28:48.329
tactics of sperm,
or the alternative tactics of

00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:50.395
eggs,
and can we actually see

00:28:50.395 --> 00:28:54.700
alternative tactics reflected at
the level of the sperm,

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.548
as well as the level of the
adult?

00:28:56.548 --> 00:28:58.900
And this is a case in which we
can.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.050
So the sperm that are produced
by males that are adopting

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.500
different tactics actually have
different swimming speeds.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.180
So the open circles are pirates;
the boxes are territorial males;

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.068
the sneakers are these filled
dots;

00:29:16.068 --> 00:29:18.318
and the triangles are satellite
males.

00:29:18.318 --> 00:29:22.090
And this is a cichlid fish from
Lake Tanganyika that broods in

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.740
shells, and has this range of
alternative male behaviors.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.829
And if you look at how fast the
sperm can swim,

00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:35.165
they have, in the first minute,
they all have better swimming

00:29:35.165 --> 00:29:38.990
speeds than after about a minute
or so.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.834
So what happens is they go
through their energy stores

00:29:41.834 --> 00:29:44.060
really quickly--
it's like that first minute is

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.952
really important,
so they all sprint for a

00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:52.009
minute--but then the sneakers
manage to hang on better over

00:29:52.009 --> 00:29:54.798
the next five or six minutes.
 

00:29:54.798 --> 00:30:00.740
So this is an interesting case
where the whole organism,

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:05.200
alternative morphology and
behavior,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:12.526
is associated with a syndrome
at the gamete level of changes

00:30:12.526 --> 00:30:15.009
in swimming speed.
 

00:30:15.009 --> 00:30:17.744
This hasn't been much
investigated,

00:30:17.744 --> 00:30:22.574
and my guess is that there's a
lot more stuff like this going

00:30:22.574 --> 00:30:25.309
on than we already know about.
 

00:30:25.309 --> 00:30:28.038
Well how about other fish?
 

00:30:28.038 --> 00:30:31.807
Well a lot of the things that
you're probably familiar with

00:30:31.807 --> 00:30:35.576
happen to be species in which
alternative male reproductive

00:30:35.576 --> 00:30:37.588
tactics are well described.
 

00:30:37.588 --> 00:30:41.890
One of the classic ones is the
bluegill sunfish,

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:45.548
and another are the West Coast
salmon.

00:30:45.548 --> 00:30:50.568
So this is male bluegill,
and this is a male Coho.

00:30:50.568 --> 00:30:56.579
And these numbers here are
actually years.

00:30:56.579 --> 00:30:57.759
Okay?
 

00:30:57.759 --> 00:31:02.390
So the bluegill is a fairly
long-lived sunfish,

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:07.932
and the female is born and
matures at- grows up and matures

00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:12.307
at about four years,
and then has probably about

00:31:12.307 --> 00:31:16.338
another three to four years of
reproductive life.

00:31:16.338 --> 00:31:23.058
The male makes a decision after
say late in its first year.

00:31:23.058 --> 00:31:26.490
So if it's born say in June,
then a year later,

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.253
in August or September,
the male is making a decision

00:31:29.253 --> 00:31:31.858
either to become a sneaker and a
female mimic,

00:31:31.858 --> 00:31:36.990
or to commit to growing for
another five years before it

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.750
will mature into the dominant
guarding male form.

00:31:45.548 --> 00:31:47.690
Now these are pictures of
what's going on.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.808
The bluegills like,
by the way, most centrarchids,

00:31:50.808 --> 00:31:54.565
dig a nest and deposit- and the
male is going to be guarding

00:31:54.565 --> 00:31:56.730
eggs that are deposited there.
 

00:31:56.730 --> 00:32:00.663
And the sneaker will come in
and basically come into a

00:32:00.663 --> 00:32:04.176
breeding assemblage,
and actually get in between the

00:32:04.176 --> 00:32:07.050
male and the female,
while the eggs and sperms are

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.930
being released.
 

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.964
He actually pushes in between
them, he's sandwiched in between

00:32:11.964 --> 00:32:14.480
them when he releases his own
sperm.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.011
In West Coast salmon,
which are genus

00:32:18.011 --> 00:32:22.028
Oncorhynchus,
Pacific salmon,

00:32:22.028 --> 00:32:27.538
the difference in size is even
more dramatic,

00:32:27.538 --> 00:32:30.538
and the difference in life
history is huge.

00:32:30.538 --> 00:32:33.828
So again in the summer of,
you know,

00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:37.694
following say the first
birthday, the male is making a

00:32:37.694 --> 00:32:41.269
decision either to stay at home
in the stream,

00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:43.769
or go to sea.
 

00:32:43.769 --> 00:32:48.586
And let me remind you that
salmon are anadromous they run

00:32:48.586 --> 00:32:50.480
up streams to spawn.
 

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:54.057
They lay their eggs into well
aerated gravel reds in the

00:32:54.057 --> 00:32:55.618
spring, in the stream.
 

00:32:55.618 --> 00:32:57.743
When they hatch out,
depending on the species,

00:32:57.743 --> 00:33:00.859
they either spend a little time
or a lot of time in fresh water.

00:33:00.859 --> 00:33:03.078
Many of them go to sea.
 

00:33:03.078 --> 00:33:05.868
And what they get by going to
sea--which by the way is a very

00:33:05.868 --> 00:33:07.328
risky thing to do;
it's dangerous;

00:33:07.328 --> 00:33:10.430
you run a gauntlet of predators
going downstream;

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:13.421
you get out into the North
Pacific and you have to deal

00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:16.964
with seals and killer whales and
all kinds of things that want to

00:33:16.964 --> 00:33:21.423
eat you while you're growing up;
and you may very well swim 3000

00:33:21.423 --> 00:33:25.795
miles out of a river anywhere
from California to Alaska,

00:33:25.795 --> 00:33:28.259
out into the Gulf of Alaska.
 

00:33:28.259 --> 00:33:31.200
What you get for that is rapid
growth.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.863
You can eat all kinds of stuff
in the ocean that's not

00:33:33.863 --> 00:33:35.220
available in fresh water.
 

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:39.894
So you take a huge mortality
risk to get the benefit of

00:33:39.894 --> 00:33:41.279
growing large.
 

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:47.990
Then when you come back,
the female will basically make

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.848
a nest in the stream.
 

00:33:50.848 --> 00:33:53.279
They have fantastic homing
ability.

00:33:53.279 --> 00:33:56.300
It has been calculated that a
salmon say swimming up the

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.472
Fraser River,
or the Columbia,

00:33:58.472 --> 00:34:03.567
and it's smelling the different
tributaries that are coming into

00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:06.557
the river,
it can detect a difference of

00:34:06.557 --> 00:34:10.144
one molecule concentration
between its left and its right

00:34:10.144 --> 00:34:10.849
nostril.
 

00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:14.003
So it will tack the right way,
going up stream,

00:34:14.003 --> 00:34:17.909
to get into the particular
ground where it's going to make

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:18.869
this nest.
 

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:21.583
And when it makes the nest,
you have a fish which is

00:34:21.583 --> 00:34:24.427
probably about this big,
which is tossing boulders,

00:34:24.427 --> 00:34:26.666
which are about this big,
out of the way,

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:29.360
to dig out its nest and
excavate a place where it can

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.190
lay its eggs.
 

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.318
And in comes a male,
who has gone out to sea and

00:34:33.318 --> 00:34:36.449
weathered all of those
tribulations and whatnot,

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:38.780
and he is coming home to spawn.
 

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.463
And lurking there on the
sidelines are these guys that

00:34:41.463 --> 00:34:42.780
never went to the ocean.
 

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.679
They're tiny,
weenie little guys.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:49.219
They never took the risk,
but they run in and sneak a

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:50.179
spawning.
 

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:51.860
Okay?
 

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.000
This is the size difference,
on the spawning ground.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
And the eggs are released and
they fall down into the gravel,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.900
and actually the insemination
is going to go on down in the

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.449
gravel.
 

00:35:02.449 --> 00:35:05.300
So it's not as though this is
something that's easy to

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:05.840
control.
 

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.346
Doubtless, if you are an adult
ocean going male,

00:35:08.346 --> 00:35:11.492
you are a bit irritated to have
these little whippersnappers

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:13.679
there stealing your matings from
you.

00:35:13.679 --> 00:35:17.961
But they're so small that they
can actually go down and hide in

00:35:17.961 --> 00:35:18.860
the gravel.
 

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.869
So, in fact,
it's a stable polymorphism.

00:35:22.869 --> 00:35:27.400
Both--the female would never
actually release her eggs if

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:30.800
there weren't a big guarding
male there.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.222
These little guys just don't
elicit that kind of reaction

00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:33.699
from her.
 

00:35:33.699 --> 00:35:39.429
So his presence is creating
this opportunity for them.

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:41.340
Okay?
 

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:48.018
Now it turns out that there are
sneakers and guarders also in

00:35:48.018 --> 00:35:52.286
dung beetles;
you know, just go across the

00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:57.849
entire Tree of Life and you will
find almost every chink in a

00:35:57.849 --> 00:36:00.909
mating system being exploited.
 

00:36:00.909 --> 00:36:04.822
So if you look across sixteen
different species of dung

00:36:04.822 --> 00:36:07.014
beetles,
that have sneakers,

00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:11.130
you can document that the
sneakers have larger testes,

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.077
and that sneaker frequency
actually influenced male

00:36:15.077 --> 00:36:17.210
expenditure on ejaculate.
 

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.472
So this is a case in which the
guarding males can see that

00:36:20.472 --> 00:36:23.708
there's a sneaker there,
and if there is a sneaker

00:36:23.708 --> 00:36:27.760
there, they up the amount that
they put into the ejaculate.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.190
So there is a flexible local
response that's triggered by

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.869
this.
 

00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:38.389
This is one such species.
 

00:36:38.389 --> 00:36:43.789
Now why is it that I've been
talking about males?

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.409
Why haven't I been talking
about females?

00:36:59.539 --> 00:37:01.590
Student: Is it because
the males are usually the ones

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:03.940
that left. 
Prof: Usually they are.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:07.362
And so in what kind of a mating
system do you think you might

00:37:07.362 --> 00:37:10.387
have the potential for the
evolution of an alternative

00:37:10.387 --> 00:37:12.269
female reproductive strategy?
 

00:37:12.269 --> 00:37:19.099
Student: Well poly--
Prof: Yes, polyandry.

00:37:19.099 --> 00:37:21.500
Something like this.
 

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:24.983
This is a pair;
this is a male and a female

00:37:24.983 --> 00:37:25.480
jacana.
 

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.440
They are in the Amazon.
 

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.940
My wife took the picture,
from the front of a Zodiac.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:36.498
And she's got about four or
five of these guys,

00:37:36.498 --> 00:37:38.679
that she's guarding.
 

00:37:38.679 --> 00:37:41.693
So she has a territory that's
about an acre,

00:37:41.693 --> 00:37:44.987
on which four or five males are
sitting on eggs,

00:37:44.987 --> 00:37:47.579
and she is defending all of
them.

00:37:47.579 --> 00:37:52.731
And you can see that her
fighting spurs here on her wings

00:37:52.731 --> 00:37:57.789
are a bit larger than the
male's, and she takes the lead

00:37:57.789 --> 00:37:59.170
in defense.
 

00:37:59.170 --> 00:38:03.387
So she actually charged the
Zodiac and tried to drive off a

00:38:03.387 --> 00:38:06.150
boat that was 1000 times her
weight.

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.467
In this kind of a situation you
might think that an alternative

00:38:11.467 --> 00:38:15.070
female reproductive tactic could
evolve.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:20.023
In fact, polyandry is so rare
in the animal world that there's

00:38:20.023 --> 00:38:22.460
very little evidence for it.
 

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.588
But certainly abstractly that's
the sort of situation in which

00:38:25.588 --> 00:38:26.460
it could occur.
 

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:29.000
The other naturally is more
cultural.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.320
That would be in the harems of
the great dynasties;

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.590
lots of alternative female
reproductive tactics there.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.853
So the main issues that we see
in alternative breeding

00:38:40.853 --> 00:38:45.440
strategies are first this idea
of frequency dependence.

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.992
And if there's anything you
remember, you know,

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:50.547
from this lecture,
when you're fifty-years-old,

00:38:50.547 --> 00:38:51.380
this is it.
 

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:52.199
Okay?
 

00:38:52.199 --> 00:38:57.632
It's that once you get a
guarding male and a female well

00:38:57.632 --> 00:39:00.826
evolved,
they then form a focus for

00:39:00.826 --> 00:39:05.766
further evolution that creates
the opportunity for a frequency

00:39:05.766 --> 00:39:10.396
dependent minority behavior,
like sneaking or pirates or

00:39:10.396 --> 00:39:11.530
female mimics.
 

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.590
The condition dependence of
this is well established;

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.360
and let me talk about that for
a minute.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.255
Several times I have mentioned
with the fish that it's in the

00:39:21.255 --> 00:39:23.201
late summer,
right after their first

00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:25.565
birthday, that they're making a
decision to go one way or

00:39:25.565 --> 00:39:26.030
another.
 

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:29.206
That decision,
whether you're going to grow

00:39:29.206 --> 00:39:31.449
up,
develop into a guarder or into

00:39:31.449 --> 00:39:34.822
a sneaker or a female mimic,
is often determined by your

00:39:34.822 --> 00:39:36.289
condition at that point.
 

00:39:36.289 --> 00:39:39.280
Have you been able to grow fast
or are you growing slowly?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.960
And if you are at the upper end
of your growth cohort,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.800
if you're one of the really
good growers,

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.369
you probably commit,
if you're a salmon,

00:39:49.369 --> 00:39:52.170
to going to sea;
if you are a bluegill sunfish

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.644
to growing up,
spending another five years to

00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:57.451
become a guarder;
and if you're at the lower end

00:39:57.451 --> 00:40:00.532
of that, you will commit to
becoming a female mimic or a

00:40:00.532 --> 00:40:01.150
sneaker.
 

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:06.250
And it's important to see that
that's a condition-dependent

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.559
strategy, and it can depend on a
lot of things.

00:40:10.559 --> 00:40:13.670
It doesn't necessarily depend
just on the genetic quality of

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.722
that particular individual;
it can depend on the growth

00:40:16.722 --> 00:40:20.106
history, the local environment,
anything that's going to lead

00:40:20.106 --> 00:40:22.590
to either a rapid or a slow
growth curve.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:27.230
So condition-dependence in
these situations is well

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.530
established.
 

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:31.530
Female choice is often an open
issue.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:40.829
You might think that females
might want to favor one or the

00:40:40.829 --> 00:40:44.793
other of two male morphs,
but in fact I think if you

00:40:44.793 --> 00:40:48.429
think about it for a minute,
there may not be much reason

00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:49.969
for female choice.
 

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:54.840
Can anybody tell me why there
might not be?

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.389
There you are, you're a female.
 

00:40:56.389 --> 00:40:59.884
You've got thousands of years
of evolutionary history to

00:40:59.884 --> 00:41:01.409
inform your decisions.
 

00:41:01.409 --> 00:41:03.940
You see the guarder and the
sneaker.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:05.389
Should you prefer one?
 

00:41:05.389 --> 00:41:05.659
Yes Blake?
 

00:41:05.659 --> 00:41:08.114
Student: Super male is
more successful and manages to

00:41:08.114 --> 00:41:10.257
fertilize her eggs,
since they're more fit,

00:41:10.257 --> 00:41:13.619
and you want your sons to have
that &gt;.

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:14.889
Prof: That's right.
 

00:41:14.889 --> 00:41:19.099
But what happens in the
frequency dependence of the two?

00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:22.259
What happens to the frequency
of the two morphs,

00:41:22.259 --> 00:41:24.409
the sneakers and the guarders?
 

00:41:24.409 --> 00:41:27.269
Let's suppose they're at
evolutionary equilibrium.

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:31.010
What's the relative fitness?
 

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.030
They'll be equal.
 

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:34.820
So if you're looking at two
guys that actually because of

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:37.762
the frequency dependent process
have come to an evolutionary

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:39.626
equilibrium,
and you're scratching your head

00:41:39.626 --> 00:41:41.570
and trying to decide,
should I make a choice between

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:41.809
them?
 

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:43.960
The answer is evolution doesn't
care.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.284
Those guys are going to give
you the same number of

00:41:46.284 --> 00:41:47.030
grandchildren.
 

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.219
That's another factor that
stabilizes this interaction.

00:41:53.219 --> 00:41:56.902
It's not just the fact that
males are competing with each

00:41:56.902 --> 00:41:58.547
other;
it's that once their

00:41:58.547 --> 00:42:01.565
competition has come to an
equilibrium, there isn't any

00:42:01.565 --> 00:42:04.639
reason for the females to prefer
one over the other.

00:42:04.639 --> 00:42:07.536
They're going to get the same
number of grandchildren out of

00:42:07.536 --> 00:42:07.880
both.
 

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:08.909
Yes?
 

00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:11.083
Student: But if the
female is more prepared and

00:42:11.083 --> 00:42:12.190
&gt;
 

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:17.384
with really big males,
and the females will only spawn

00:42:17.384 --> 00:42:22.677
when they see one of those,
not when they see the small

00:42:22.677 --> 00:42:23.559
guys.
 

00:42:23.559 --> 00:42:26.391
Prof: The females,
remember, have an evolutionary

00:42:26.391 --> 00:42:28.730
history of having started out in
that situation,

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:34.306
and so the lack of female
preference is probably more that

00:42:34.306 --> 00:42:38.219
they're not chasing away the
sneakers.

00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:42.231
And they do,
by the way, want to get their

00:42:42.231 --> 00:42:44.090
eggs into a nest.
 

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:44.440
Right?
 

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.809
And only the guarder is going
to do that for them.

00:42:46.809 --> 00:42:49.509
So in that sense they have to
prefer the guarder because he'll

00:42:49.509 --> 00:42:50.659
take care of their eggs.
 

00:42:50.659 --> 00:42:53.650
But when they're actually in
the mating situation,

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:56.193
and they have the option of
going five inches to the left or

00:42:56.193 --> 00:42:59.047
five inches to the right,
and they can see that they're

00:42:59.047 --> 00:43:01.889
surrounded by a guarder and a
bunch of sneakers,

00:43:01.889 --> 00:43:05.199
they don't--in that situation
they don't care.

00:43:05.199 --> 00:43:08.329
Because their eggs are going to
get into that guarder's nests,

00:43:08.329 --> 00:43:11.510
whether they're fertilized by
the guarder or by the sneaker.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.266
But I take your point,
they do have to get the eggs

00:43:16.266 --> 00:43:18.550
into a guarder's nest.
 

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:21.833
So sperm adaptations are quite
interesting, and they're

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:23.719
increasingly well understood.
 

00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:27.030
There is a growing literature
on gamete evolution,

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.407
and it turns out that gamete
evolution can be quite

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:31.489
complicated.
 

00:43:31.489 --> 00:43:34.255
I think some of you have run
into the concept of Kamikaze

00:43:34.255 --> 00:43:37.117
sperm or sperm that themselves
have split up into different

00:43:37.117 --> 00:43:39.389
tactics in the female
reproductive tract,

00:43:39.389 --> 00:43:40.530
and things like that.
 

00:43:40.530 --> 00:43:43.460
That's an interesting thing to
look into.

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:45.409
So that's it for today.
 

00:43:45.409 --> 00:43:47.980
And next time is the last
lecture, and I'm going to talk

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.130
about selfishness,
altruism and cooperation.

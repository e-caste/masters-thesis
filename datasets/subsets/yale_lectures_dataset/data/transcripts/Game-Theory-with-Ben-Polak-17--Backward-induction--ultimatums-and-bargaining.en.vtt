00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.214
Professor Ben Polak:
So today I want to look at

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:08.280
two kinds of games and then
we'll change topic a bit.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.900
The games I want to look at are
about ultimatums and bargaining.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.176
And we'll start with ultimatums
and we'll move smoothly through,

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.140
and we'll see why that's an
easy transition in a while.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:29.525
So the game we're going to play
involves two players,

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:39.260
1 and 2 and the game is this.
Player 1 is going to make a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:48.460
take it or leave it offer to
Player 2 and this offer is going

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:57.660
to concern a pie and let's make
the pie worth $1 for now.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.356
We'll probably play this for
real in a bit so we'll play it

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:04.279
for $1.
So it's a split of a pie,

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:09.352
we can think of the split as
offering S to Player 1 and

00:01:09.352 --> 00:01:15.854
(1--S) to Player 2.
Player 2 has two choices:

00:01:15.854 --> 00:01:25.609
2 can accept this offer,
and if 2 accepts the offer then

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:33.975
they get exactly the offer.
Player 1 gets S and Player 2

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:37.544
gets (1--S).
Alternatively,

00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:44.776
Player 2 can reject,
and if Player 2 rejects the

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:54.010
offer then both players get 0,
both players gets nothing.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.440
So a very simple game,
there's a dollar on the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.573
table--I'll take it out in a
minute--so there's a dollar on

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:01.960
the table,
and our two players are going

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.939
to bargain for this,
but it isn't much of a bargain.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.484
Player 1's basically going to
announce what the division's

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:10.017
going to be.
2 can either accept that

00:02:10.017 --> 00:02:12.720
division or no one gets
anything.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.202
Everyone understand the game?
So I thought we'd start off by

00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:20.123
playing this game for real a
couple of times,

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:22.780
so why don't I come down and do
that.

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.580
So why don't we play with some
people in this row.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.025
I've been playing with that row
all the time,

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:34.360
so Ale's going to help me find
somebody.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.960
You found somebody okay,
so the person behind you?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.870
Your name is?
You have to shout out,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.099
this doesn't make a noise.
Equia, thank you.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.534
So you'll be Player 1,
and Player 2 will be this

00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:53.990
gentleman here whose name is?
Student: Noah.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.000
Professor Ben Polak:
Noah, okay.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.340
So Equia, do you know each
other?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.310
Okay, so Equia can make any
offer she wants.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.403
We'll play this for real money,
so there's a real dollar at

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:07.102
stake.
You can make any offer you

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:09.941
want--it can be in fractions of
pennies if you like--of the

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:12.830
amount of the dollar that you're
going to offer to Noah,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.069
and the amount you're going to
keep yourself.

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.863
There you go,
shout it out so everyone can

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:22.928
hear.
Stand up, this is your moment

00:03:22.928 --> 00:03:28.590
in the lights all right.
Will you stand up as well?

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.759
There we go.
Student: I'm going to

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.150
offer him a penny.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.713
You're going to offer him a
penny, and Noah are you going to

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:34.466
take a penny?
Student: No.

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:35.461
Professor Ben Polak:
Noah's not going to take a

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.441
penny.
So I didn't lose any money on

00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:40.410
that: so no one made any money.
I didn't lose any money.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.449
that seems pretty good.
Let's try a different couple.

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.810
Let's move around the room a
little bit.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.780
So Ale why don't you take the
guy behind here who name is?

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.129
Shout out.
Student: Gary.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.221
Professor Ben Polak:
Gary, all right so Gary why

00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:57.911
don't you stand up,
and we'll let Gary play with

00:03:57.911 --> 00:03:59.970
the gentleman in here,
what's your name in here?

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.755
Student: Anish.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:01.755 --> 00:04:03.490
Anish, all right stand up,
do you know each other?

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.250
So why don't we let Anish be
Player 1 this time.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.440
You understand the rule of the
game?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.196
So make your offer.
Student: $.30.

00:04:13.196 --> 00:04:16.320
I'm offering him $.30.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.810
You're offering him $.30?
He's saying no as well.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.360
Okay, so let's raise the stakes
a bit.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.076
Let's make it $10,
since we're not getting much

00:04:26.076 --> 00:04:28.640
acceptance here.
Let me try a third couple,

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.775
working my way back,
so how about you,

00:04:30.775 --> 00:04:32.899
what's your name?
Student: Courtney.

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.032
Professor Ben Polak:
So why don't you stand up

00:04:34.032 --> 00:04:36.290
as well.
We'll let Courtney be Player 1.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.889
Actually why don't you sit down
so I can do it from here,

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.149
and you are?
Student: Danny.

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:41.440
Professor Ben Polak:
Danny, all right so

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.151
Courtney's going to be Player 1
and Danny's going to be Player

00:04:43.151 --> 00:04:44.523
2.
These weren't our dating couple

00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:46.000
from earlier right?
We're safe on that?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.600
Okay good, so Courtney what are
you going to offer?

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.477
Student: $5.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:51.670
$5, which is half of the
$10.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.201
Student: Accept.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.379
All right accept,
all right.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.546
So it turned out in this game
that a lot of people were

00:04:59.546 --> 00:05:01.925
rejecting offers.
Let's have a look at it on the

00:05:01.925 --> 00:05:03.994
board a second.
Let's think about it a second

00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:06.109
and we'll come back,
we're not done with this

00:05:06.109 --> 00:05:07.560
couple.
We're not going to need new

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.069
couples, we're going to come
back to you.

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:15.148
So in this game--it's pretty
simple to analyze this game by

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:19.070
backward induction.
By backward induction,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.606
we're going to start with the
receiver of the offer and the

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:27.908
receiver of the offer is
choosing between the offer made

00:05:27.908 --> 00:05:31.350
to them which in our notation is
(1-S).

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.152
And in our three examples that
was a penny, then it was $.30

00:05:35.152 --> 00:05:39.019
and then it was half of it,
so $.50 just to be consistent.

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:41.826
We actually saw two of those
offers rejected,

00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:44.250
but according to backward
induction,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.224
assuming that people are trying
to maximize their dollar payoffs

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:52.620
here, what should we see the
receiver do?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.516
They should accept even the
somewhat insulting offer of a

00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:59.855
penny that was made:
even that somewhat insulting

00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:02.430
offer should be accepted by
Noah.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.065
So Noah didn't accept the offer
of a penny and let's come back

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.602
over there.
So Noah didn't accept the offer

00:06:08.602 --> 00:06:12.014
a penny, and I forget who it was
but our second player didn't

00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:14.854
accept an offer of $.30,
but we've just argued that they

00:06:14.854 --> 00:06:17.764
should have been accepted.
In fact, when Equia made the

00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:21.314
offer of one penny to Noah,
I think she assumed that Noah

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:23.470
would accept it,
is this right?

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.230
Why did you think Noah would
accept it?

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.884
Student: Because I felt
he would be better off with a

00:06:27.884 --> 00:06:29.402
penny than nothing.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:06:29.402 --> 00:06:30.596
He'd be better off with a
penny than nothing,

00:06:30.596 --> 00:06:31.840
right.
Then we saw an offer.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.180
The offer came up a bit.
Who was my second offerer?

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.760
You were my second offerer,
you offered a bit more.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.209
Why did you offer more?
Student: I felt $.30 was

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:40.879
a pretty fair share.
It's a lot better than nothing.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.885
Professor Ben Polak:
Thirty cents is better than

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:44.297
nothing, although not
necessarily fair,

00:06:44.297 --> 00:06:45.819
but I guess it's better than
nothing.

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:48.480
Where was my rejector of the
second offer?

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.290
Who rejected the second offer?
Why did you reject $.30?

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.490
Student: Just a pride
thing.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.209
Professor Ben Polak:
It's a pride thing.

00:06:55.209 --> 00:06:59.548
Pretty soon we converged onto
$.50, which notice is no where

00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:02.918
near backward induction.
So the third offer,

00:07:02.918 --> 00:07:06.680
which is Courtney,
why did you offer half of it?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.279
Student: Because half is
better for me than nothing.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.926
Professor Ben Polak:
Half is better for you than

00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:12.603
nothing, and you figured he's
going to reject otherwise,

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:14.189
and in fact he didn't reject.
Why didn't you reject?

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:15.394
Student: Because $5 is
better than nothing.

00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:16.769
Professor Ben Polak:
$5 is better than nothing.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.243
But the $5 is better than
nothing argument would have

00:07:19.243 --> 00:07:21.670
argued against making any
rejection in this game.

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:24.253
Is that right?
So here's a game where backward

00:07:24.253 --> 00:07:27.220
induction is giving a very clear
prediction.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.719
The clear prediction is,
first of all,

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:33.569
the second player will accept
whatever's given to them;

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:37.359
and second, given that,
the first player should offer

00:07:37.359 --> 00:07:41.660
them essentially nothing,
should offer them just a penny.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:48.881
So backward induction predicts
that the offer will be

00:07:48.881 --> 00:07:57.353
essentially, let's say $.99 and
$.01, or even virtually $1 and

00:07:57.353 --> 00:08:00.693
nothing.
But in fact we don't get that,

00:08:00.693 --> 00:08:03.202
we get a lot of rejection of
these low offers,

00:08:03.202 --> 00:08:06.103
and often we get offers made
much, much higher in the

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:08.022
vicinity of half.
Now why?

00:08:08.022 --> 00:08:13.560
Why are we seeing a failure of
backward induction in this game?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.199
I think this is not necessarily
you guys.

00:08:15.199 --> 00:08:18.819
It's a very reliable result in
experimental data.

00:08:18.819 --> 00:08:23.340
So why do we see so many people
in this ultimatum game both

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.912
offer more, and,
more importantly,

00:08:25.912 --> 00:08:30.134
reject less than small amounts.
So let's talk about it,

00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:32.669
so one person said it's a pride
thing.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.257
Let's try the other aisle here,
so what's the smallest offer

00:08:38.257 --> 00:08:42.190
you would have accepted.
What's your name first of all?

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:48.633
Student: Jeff. A cent.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:50.720
So there are some backward
induction players in the room.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:58.470
Who would have rejected a cent?
Who would have rejected $.10?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:02.647
We should be going down at
least, who would have rejected

00:09:02.647 --> 00:09:04.607
$.30?
Few people rejected $.30,

00:09:04.607 --> 00:09:07.970
not many actually.
How many people would have

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:10.552
rejected $.50?
One person even would have

00:09:10.552 --> 00:09:12.460
rejected $.50,
but essentially no one.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.318
So what's happening here?
Why do people think people are

00:09:16.318 --> 00:09:18.782
rejecting what is essentially
money from my pocket,

00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:21.740
there's nothing going on here,
I'm just giving you money.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.279
Why are they rejecting being
given money?

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:26.745
Student: Overall the
stakes are really low,

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:29.210
so if you have any value on
sort of like pride,

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.578
what people said,
you know it's not worth a penny

00:09:32.578 --> 00:09:34.351
or $.10.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.260
All right,
so it may be pride going on

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.450
here, so certainly one thing is
about pride.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.898
It turns out that people do
this even in quite high stakes

00:09:40.898 --> 00:09:43.090
games, but you're right,
certainly that trade off is

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.113
going to start to bite.
What else is going on?

00:09:45.113 --> 00:09:46.920
So I agree, pride is part of
what's going on.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.826
What else is going on here?
Let's try and get some

00:09:49.826 --> 00:09:51.412
conversation going.
Somebody in here,

00:09:51.412 --> 00:09:53.524
if I can get the mike in,
shout out your name and really

00:09:53.524 --> 00:09:54.850
shout.
Student: Peter.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.409
Professor Ben Polak:
Go on.

00:09:56.409 --> 00:09:58.019
Student: Change is
cumbersome.

00:09:58.019 --> 00:10:00.544
Professor Ben Polak:
Change is cumbersome,

00:10:00.544 --> 00:10:02.857
you didn't want the change,
okay fair enough,

00:10:02.857 --> 00:10:05.750
but if the stakes go up that
would get rid of that.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.566
Student: Maybe people
are tying their own outcomes to

00:10:08.566 --> 00:10:10.379
the other player's outcomes as
well.

00:10:10.379 --> 00:10:11.883
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so maybe people have

00:10:11.883 --> 00:10:13.815
different payoffs here.
Maybe people are comparing

00:10:13.815 --> 00:10:16.429
their payoff to the other
person's payoff that certainly

00:10:16.429 --> 00:10:18.899
seems like a plausible thing to
be going on here.

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:23.132
You might feel less happy about
getting $.20 knowing the other

00:10:23.132 --> 00:10:25.629
person's getting $.80 for
example.

00:10:25.629 --> 00:10:27.815
Student: You want to try
to teach them a lesson to get

00:10:27.815 --> 00:10:29.235
them to offer more.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:29.235 --> 00:10:30.972
Right, you might be trying
to set a sort of moral standard

00:10:30.972 --> 00:10:32.437
here.
So there's some notion of

00:10:32.437 --> 00:10:35.310
indignation or even teaching
people that they really should

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.960
offer people more.
What else could be going on

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.949
here?
Student: If people know

00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:46.689
I'm not going to accept less
than $.50 then they should give

00:10:46.689 --> 00:10:50.123
me $.50 by backward induction.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:10:50.123 --> 00:10:52.029
Right, so part of what's
going on here--actually this

00:10:52.029 --> 00:10:53.799
game was a one shot game,
we just played it once.

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:56.586
We could have played it--in
fact they often do play this

00:10:56.586 --> 00:10:59.625
this way in the lab--you could
have played it without anybody

00:10:59.625 --> 00:11:01.500
knowing who the other player
was.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.620
But particularly in this
setting where everyone can see

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.144
everyone else--even in the lab
where people actually can't see

00:11:08.144 --> 00:11:10.165
people,
but they might imagine that the

00:11:10.165 --> 00:11:12.757
game is really repeated--you
could imagine people trying to

00:11:12.757 --> 00:11:15.000
establish a reputation.
Is that right?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.269
So there's lots of these
reasons, these sort of moral

00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:19.364
indignation reasons or teaching
a lesson reasons,

00:11:19.364 --> 00:11:21.734
pride reasons.
There's also this basic reason

00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:24.797
that people might be thinking,
I should play this game as I

00:11:24.797 --> 00:11:27.808
would a similar situation in
life where I might want to be

00:11:27.808 --> 00:11:30.920
establishing reputation.
So there's a certain amount of

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.922
confusion going on in the game,
and there's also a certain

00:11:33.922 --> 00:11:36.029
amount of a lot of things make
sense.

00:11:36.029 --> 00:11:39.876
Now notice that once we've
established that people are

00:11:39.876 --> 00:11:43.070
going to reject small offers in
this game,

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.935
once we've established people
are going to reject small

00:11:45.935 --> 00:11:49.173
offers, it makes perfectly good
sense to offer a lot more than

00:11:49.173 --> 00:11:50.897
nothing.
So it's not that surprising

00:11:50.897 --> 00:11:53.313
that once we've established the
idea that people are going to

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:55.711
reject small offers,
we're going to see people

00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:58.006
making offers that are
reasonably large,

00:11:58.006 --> 00:12:00.420
although not usually larger
than $.50.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:08.130
Why is $.50 so focal here?
Why is $.50 so focal?

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.481
It's not a trick question.
I'm just asking you why do

00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:13.783
people think $.50 is so focal?
I think it's typical that

00:12:13.783 --> 00:12:16.480
people end up offering around
$.50, why?

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.250
It sounds fair, it seems fair.
There's some notion of fairness.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:23.279
It's not clear by the way,
what ethical principal is

00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:25.842
involved here.
It's not clear that if you're

00:12:25.842 --> 00:12:29.121
walking along the streets and
you happen to find a dollar at

00:12:29.121 --> 00:12:32.290
your feet that you should pick
it up and anyone else you'd

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.570
happen to see at that moment you
should give $.50 too.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:37.269
That's essentially what the
situation is,

00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:39.860
and you just chanced upon this
dollar that I just gave you.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.218
It isn't clear that there's any
particularly great moral claim

00:12:42.218 --> 00:12:45.225
to give it to someone else,
but I think people read this as

00:12:45.225 --> 00:12:48.508
a situation about splitting a
cake in an environment of

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:51.202
distributional justice.
They view it as a larger

00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:53.070
picture.
Is that right?

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.289
So it turns out there's a large
literature on this.

00:12:55.289 --> 00:12:58.199
There's a large experimental
literature on the ultimatum

00:12:58.199 --> 00:12:59.983
game.
And there's an even larger

00:12:59.983 --> 00:13:03.136
literature on an even simpler
game in which I give people a

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:04.893
dollar,
I say you can give whatever

00:13:04.893 --> 00:13:07.501
share you want to the other
person, and they don't even get

00:13:07.501 --> 00:13:10.409
a chance to accept or reject.
That's called a dictator game.

00:13:10.409 --> 00:13:13.378
In the dictator game,
literally, you're just simply

00:13:13.378 --> 00:13:17.000
given a dollar and you can give
whatever share you want to the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.327
other person.
It turns out that even in the

00:13:19.327 --> 00:13:21.144
dictator game,
people give quite a lot of

00:13:21.144 --> 00:13:23.778
money and that suggests that
there really is some notion of

00:13:23.778 --> 00:13:26.367
fairness or some notion of
distributional justice going on

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.460
in people's heads here,
rightly or wrongly.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.927
So one thing this should tell
us is, even in extremely simple

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:38.542
games, we should be a little bit
careful about reading backward

00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:43.009
induction into what's going to
happen in the real world.

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:44.785
Part of this is because,
as we mentioned the very first

00:13:44.785 --> 00:13:46.331
day of the class,
people care about other things

00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.447
than just the obvious payoffs,
and part of it is about more

00:13:49.447 --> 00:13:52.730
complicated things like
reputation and so on.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.098
All right, having said that,
let's nevertheless for the

00:13:56.098 --> 00:13:58.905
purpose of today,
act as if we are going to do

00:13:58.905 --> 00:14:01.914
backward induction,
and let's embed this into a

00:14:01.914 --> 00:14:05.589
slightly more complicated game.
So the more complicated game is

00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:06.290
as follows.

00:14:15.789 --> 00:14:24.259
So we're going to have a two
period bargaining game.

00:14:24.259 --> 00:14:25.988
In this two period,
bargaining game,

00:14:25.988 --> 00:14:28.360
the beginning of the game is
exactly the same.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:36.141
So there's a dollar on the
table and Player 1 makes an

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:40.203
offer to 2.
And once again we can call this

00:14:40.203 --> 00:14:43.259
offer S and 1 - S,
just the same as before.

00:14:43.259 --> 00:14:49.016
And, just as before,
Player 2 can accept the offer,

00:14:49.016 --> 00:14:55.578
and if they accept the offer
then this is indeed what they

00:14:55.578 --> 00:14:58.700
get.
But now if 2 rejects,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.938
which is 2's other
alternative--if Player 2 rejects

00:15:03.938 --> 00:15:07.710
the offer then we flip the
roles.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:12.009
We play the game again but we
flip the roles.

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:15.062
So we go to stage two,
everything we've said up here

00:15:15.062 --> 00:15:15.960
is stage one.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:29.952
And down here we go to stage
two, and in stage two,

00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:37.820
Player 2 gets to make an offer
to 1.

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:43.409
And once again we can call
this--we better be careful.

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:46.985
Let's put ones here just to
indicate we're in the first

00:15:46.985 --> 00:15:50.230
round and twos to indicate we're
in the second.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:55.564
So they make an offer is S2 and
(1-S2) where S2 is that that

00:15:55.564 --> 00:16:00.990
goes to Player 1 and (1-S2) is
that that goes to Player 2.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.183
So 2 gets to make an offer to
Player 1 and now 1 can accept or

00:16:06.183 --> 00:16:10.372
reject.
If she accepts then she gets

00:16:10.372 --> 00:16:16.868
her share from here.
The offer is accepted,

00:16:16.868 --> 00:16:24.009
and if she rejects then we get
nothing.

00:16:24.009 --> 00:16:27.170
So this game is exactly the
same as playing the previous

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.215
game, except we flip roles,
but we're going to add one

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:32.594
catch.
The catch is this,

00:16:32.594 --> 00:16:37.307
in the first round the money on
the table is $1,

00:16:37.307 --> 00:16:42.120
but if we end up going into the
second round,

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.886
so the first offer is not
accepted and we go into the

00:16:45.886 --> 00:16:49.289
second round,
then part of the money is lost.

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:53.316
In particular,
we'll assume that the money on

00:16:53.316 --> 00:16:57.130
the table is δ.
If you think of δ

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.550
as being just some number less
than 1--so if you want a

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.480
concrete example think of this
as being $.90.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.333
So the idea here is if you get
into the second round,

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:13.039
time has past,
it's costly,

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:15.672
and so money in the second
round is--I think of it as money

00:17:15.672 --> 00:17:18.214
in the second round as being
worth less or could actually

00:17:18.214 --> 00:17:19.940
think of this cake being eaten
up,

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.940
some of it's thrown away,
some of it's wasted.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:27.298
Everyone understand the game?
So this is very similar to the

00:17:27.298 --> 00:17:30.400
previous game,
but we've got this second stage

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.640
coming in, and we've got
discounting.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.839
So this is the idea of
discounting.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:42.549
How many of you have heard the
term discounting before?

00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:46.859
You probably saw it in a
finance class or a macro class

00:17:46.859 --> 00:17:50.930
where we think about there being
a value of time.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.234
Money today is worth more than
money tomorrow,

00:17:53.234 --> 00:17:56.152
partly because you could put
the money today into the bank

00:17:56.152 --> 00:17:59.264
and it could earn interest,
partly because you're simply

00:17:59.264 --> 00:18:02.039
impatient to get that money and
go and have lunch,

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:04.259
particularly on the day in
which the clocks changed.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:09.472
Okay, so let's try this game
again and let's just play it for

00:18:09.472 --> 00:18:13.430
real, so let's come down again.
Everyone understand the game?

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:16.563
Basically the same rules except
we're just flipping around and

00:18:16.563 --> 00:18:19.029
with the possibility that the
cake may shrink.

00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:21.305
Let's see what people have
learned, so who were our first

00:18:21.305 --> 00:18:24.586
pair?
Our first pair were Equia and

00:18:24.586 --> 00:18:28.573
Noah all right.
So Equia, what are you going to

00:18:28.573 --> 00:18:30.523
offer?
You're Player 1 here but if

00:18:30.523 --> 00:18:33.740
your offer is rejected Noah's
going to get to make an offer to

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.149
you.
All right so what are you going

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:39.990
to offer this time?
Student: $25.99,

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.519
so $.25, $.46.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:45.033
$.46 okay,
so he gets $.46 if he accepts

00:18:45.033 --> 00:18:46.617
the offer, is that right?
Student: Yes.

00:18:46.617 --> 00:18:48.342
Professor Ben Polak:
$.46 if he accepts the

00:18:48.342 --> 00:18:49.346
offer.
Student: I accept that.

00:18:49.346 --> 00:18:50.129
Professor Ben Polak:
He accepts that,

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:57.521
okay that was easy.
So Equia got $.54 and Noah got

00:18:57.521 --> 00:19:00.500
$.46.
Who was our second pair?

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.692
So that was,
I've forgotten,

00:19:02.692 --> 00:19:05.940
Anish right and?
Student: Gary.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.172
Professor Ben Polak:
Gary.

00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:09.059
So Anish what are you going to
offer this time?

00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:09.943
Student: I'll offer
$.43.

00:19:09.943 --> 00:19:11.454
Professor Ben Polak:
$.43, you're going to push

00:19:11.454 --> 00:19:12.889
the envelope a little bit.
Student: All right.

00:19:12.889 --> 00:19:13.714
Professor Ben Polak:
All right,

00:19:13.714 --> 00:19:16.583
that one got accepted as well.
Okay, so people are converging

00:19:16.583 --> 00:19:19.654
here.
What about our third offerer,

00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:22.996
receiver it was Courtney and?
Student: Danny.

00:19:22.996 --> 00:19:23.906
Professor Ben Polak:
Danny.

00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:26.054
So Courtney?
Student: $.30.

00:19:26.054 --> 00:19:30.680
Professor Ben Polak:
$.30, so it's $.30 for him.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.429
Student: I'll accept.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:19:32.429 --> 00:19:33.630
Three acceptances,
all right.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.728
Let's find out something here,
so I was hoping to get into the

00:19:36.728 --> 00:19:39.611
second round.
Okay so you accepted,

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:44.460
that's fine--no chicken sounds
around the room.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.329
So, it's Danny right?
Student: Yeah.

00:19:47.329 --> 00:19:49.369
Professor Ben Polak:
So Danny had you

00:19:49.369 --> 00:19:52.262
rejected--you acceptedbut had
you accepted what would you have

00:19:52.262 --> 00:19:54.948
offered in the second round?
Student: $.45.

00:19:54.948 --> 00:19:57.340
Professor Ben Polak:
$.45, all right,

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.623
and would you have accepted
that in the second round if $.30

00:20:00.623 --> 00:20:02.873
hadn't been accepted?
Courtney: Yes.

00:20:02.873 --> 00:20:04.788
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, so you might have

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:07.372
done better it turns out.
Let's go back through to the

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.750
other rejections,
to the other acceptances.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.810
So my second couple you offered
$.43, is that right?

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.054
You said yes to $.43.
Had you rejected $.43 what

00:20:17.054 --> 00:20:19.220
would you have offered back in
return?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.196
Student: $.43.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:20:21.196 --> 00:20:24.539
$.43, the same thing back.
Would you have accepted it?

00:20:24.539 --> 00:20:26.090
Student: He gets $.47?
Professor Ben Polak: He

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.009
would have got $.47 in that
case.

00:20:27.009 --> 00:20:28.992
Student: Yeah.
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:20:28.992 --> 00:20:30.250
would have accepted that,
okay.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.170
Equia went first and she
offered $.45 to Noah.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:35.234
And Noah had,
in fact, you rejected,

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:36.299
what would you have offered
back?

00:20:36.299 --> 00:20:37.529
Student: I would have
also done $.45.

00:20:37.529 --> 00:20:39.015
Professor Ben Polak:
Same thing back and would

00:20:39.015 --> 00:20:40.159
you have accepted it?
Student: Yes.

00:20:40.159 --> 00:20:40.890
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.702
So we can see here that the
decision to accept or reject

00:20:43.702 --> 00:20:46.976
partly depends on what you think
the other side is going to do in

00:20:46.976 --> 00:20:48.950
the second round,
is that right?

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.975
So here you are,
if you're in the middle of this

00:20:51.975 --> 00:20:54.029
game.
If you're Player 2 you've

00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:56.960
received an offer.
None of these offers sounded

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.690
crazy.
$.30 was the lowest one,

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.662
but none of them sounded crazy.
And you're trying to decide

00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:03.890
whether you should accept or
reject this offer.

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:08.015
And one thing you should have
in mind is what would I offer if

00:21:08.015 --> 00:21:11.125
I reject.
And will that offer that I then

00:21:11.125 --> 00:21:14.712
offer in the next round be
accepted or rejected,

00:21:14.712 --> 00:21:17.660
is that right?
So if we just work backwards we

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.960
can see what you should offer in
the first round should be just

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.942
enough to make sure it's
accepted knowing that the person

00:21:23.942 --> 00:21:27.189
who's receiving the offer in the
first round is going to think

00:21:27.189 --> 00:21:30.650
about the offer they're going to
make in the second round,

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:32.915
and they're going to think
about whether you're going to

00:21:32.915 --> 00:21:35.140
accept or reject in the second
round, is that right?

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.761
So that sounds like a bit of a
mouthful but that mouthful of

00:21:38.761 --> 00:21:41.340
reasoning is exactly backward
induction.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:43.786
It's exactly backward induction.
It's saying:

00:21:43.786 --> 00:21:46.956
to figure out what I should do
in the first round or what I

00:21:46.956 --> 00:21:50.178
should offer in the first round,
I need to figure out whether

00:21:50.178 --> 00:21:52.000
Player 2 is going to accept or
reject.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.436
And to figure out whether he or
she is going to accept or

00:21:54.436 --> 00:21:56.829
reject, and I have to put myself
in his or her shoes,

00:21:56.829 --> 00:21:59.879
and figure out what he or she
would offer if she did reject,

00:21:59.879 --> 00:22:02.773
and what he or she thinks I
would do if I got that second

00:22:02.773 --> 00:22:04.551
round offer.
Is that right?

00:22:04.551 --> 00:22:08.223
All right, so let's try and
analyze this as if backward

00:22:08.223 --> 00:22:12.030
induction was going to work
here, as if we didn't have to

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.750
worry about things like pride
here.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:19.030
So this is the game we're
actually playing,

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.330
so let's keep that one and
actually analyze it on the

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:25.350
board.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:33.102
I want to walk us from a
largely mundane game of take it

00:22:33.102 --> 00:22:36.752
or leave it offers to a more
complicated game in which there

00:22:36.752 --> 00:22:41.269
can be several rounds of offers.
But we're going to go slowly so

00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:43.780
we'll start just with two
rounds.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:53.820
So first of all let's just look
at the stage one game,

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:59.240
and let's keep in track what
the offer is and what the

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.482
receiver.
This is the offerer and this is

00:23:04.482 --> 00:23:08.057
the receiver.
In the one stage game,

00:23:08.057 --> 00:23:12.493
the game only has one stage,
then we know from backward

00:23:12.493 --> 00:23:15.779
induction what the results
should be.

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:18.117
It isn't what we'd find in the
lab, it isn't what we find in

00:23:18.117 --> 00:23:20.019
the classroom,
but we know what we should get.

00:23:20.019 --> 00:23:23.840
The offerer should offer to
keep everything essentially or

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.130
maybe $.99 but let's call it $1
and the receiver gets nothing.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.526
So again I'm approximating a
little bit because it could be

00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:33.722
$.99 and a penny but who cares.
Let's just call it a $1 or

00:23:33.722 --> 00:23:36.119
nothing if it's a one stage
game.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:39.670
So now let's consider a two
stage game.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:44.153
In the two stage game the
person who's making the offer in

00:23:44.153 --> 00:23:47.299
the first stage needs to look
forward,

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:52.652
anticipate what would happen if
her offer was rejected by Player

00:23:52.652 --> 00:23:57.070
2 and Player 2 went forward into
the second stage.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.876
Is that right?
So in the two stage game,

00:23:59.876 --> 00:24:04.579
in the first stage of the two
stage game, the person making

00:24:04.579 --> 00:24:09.525
the offer wants to anticipate
what the receiver would offer in

00:24:09.525 --> 00:24:14.390
the second round were the
receiver to reject her offer.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.049
But we can do that by backward
induction.

00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:22.564
We know that in the second
round if the receiver rejects

00:24:22.564 --> 00:24:27.900
the offer, then the second round
of the two stage game is what?

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.559
It's a one stage game,
and we've just argued,

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:33.400
at least if we believe in
backward induction,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.863
in that case,
Player 2 who is then the

00:24:36.863 --> 00:24:40.420
offerer, will offer $1 and
Player 1,

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.490
who is now the receiver,
will accept it and get nothing.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:49.650
So Player 1 in the first round
of the two stage game wants to

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:54.811
make an offer that's just enough
to get Player 2 to accept it

00:24:54.811 --> 00:24:59.980
now.
So let's think about this.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:08.519
So if Player 1 offers 2
something more than what?

00:25:08.519 --> 00:25:13.230
Tomorrow Player 2 can get $1
but that's $1 tomorrow.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:16.610
So $1 tomorrow is worth how
much today if we're discounting?

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.579
It's just worth δ right.
It's just worth δ.

00:25:19.579 --> 00:25:23.994
So if Player 1 offers Player 2
more than δ

00:25:23.994 --> 00:25:28.312
x $1, which is what Player 2
can get tomorrow,

00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:30.520
then 2 will accept.

00:25:34.349 --> 00:25:40.053
If Player 1 offers 2 less than
δ x $1--because you can get

00:25:40.053 --> 00:25:45.572
a $1 tomorrow but that's only
worth $δ--a $1 tomorrow is

00:25:45.572 --> 00:25:50.079
worth just $δ
today--then 2 will reject.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:55.161
So the offer has to be exactly
enough to get accepted,

00:25:55.161 --> 00:26:01.565
which is exactly $δ.
So Player 2 knows that she can

00:26:01.565 --> 00:26:08.686
get $1 tomorrow so you need to
offer her at least $δ

00:26:08.686 --> 00:26:16.190
today to make it as good for
her as getting $1 tomorrow.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:21.843
So we know the receiver must be
offered at least $δ

00:26:21.843 --> 00:26:27.496
tomorrow, which means the
offerer is going to keep $[1 -

00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:31.981
δ].
So in the first round of the

00:26:31.981 --> 00:26:36.858
two stage game,
Player 1 should offer $[1 -

00:26:36.858 --> 00:26:40.341
δ]
for herself and $δ

00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:46.263
for Player 2 and Player 2
should accept that because

00:26:46.263 --> 00:26:52.650
$δ dollars today is as good
as $1 tomorrow.

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.084
Now, another way to see that is
in a picture,

00:26:55.084 --> 00:26:56.800
so let's just draw a picture.

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:05.884
Let's put the payoff of Player
1 here and the payoff of Player

00:27:05.884 --> 00:27:08.455
2 on this axis.
And we're going to assume that

00:27:08.455 --> 00:27:10.605
they're just going to maximize
dollars where there's no pride

00:27:10.605 --> 00:27:14.377
in here.
And if we just look at the one

00:27:14.377 --> 00:27:19.670
stage game, we're simply looking
at this line.

00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:23.389
The offers in the one stage
game: it could be that Player 1

00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:26.980
gets everything herself and
gives nothing to Player 2,

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.862
it could be that Player 2 keeps
everything, ends up getting

00:27:29.862 --> 00:27:31.799
everything and Player 1 gets
nothing,

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:34.890
and it could be any combination
in between.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.550
We argued by backward
induction--although not in

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:42.690
reality--in backward induction,
in the one stage game,

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:46.544
Player 1 makes an offer to
Player 2 which is kind of an

00:27:46.544 --> 00:27:50.521
insulting offer.
Player 1 says I get everything

00:27:50.521 --> 00:27:53.610
and you get a $.01.
So this is the one stage game.

00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:03.467
In the two stage,
if things are settled in the

00:28:03.467 --> 00:28:09.169
first stage this line represents
the possible divisions between

00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:13.734
Player 1 and Player 2.
But if we end up going into the

00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:16.049
second stage,
the pie is shrunk.

00:28:16.049 --> 00:28:19.941
The pie is shrunk,
instead of going from $1 to $1,

00:28:19.941 --> 00:28:22.799
it goes from $δ1 to
$δ1.

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:25.372
Or if you like,
if δ is .9 it goes from

00:28:25.372 --> 00:28:28.210
$.9 to $.9.
So let's draw that line in.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:33.917
So if we head into the second
stage, we'll end up being here,

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:37.817
and this goes from $δ
here to $δ

00:28:37.817 --> 00:28:43.620
here where these dollars are
being evaluated at time one.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.933
All right so the pie has shrunk.
If we get into the second stage

00:28:47.933 --> 00:28:52.374
then, by backward induction,
Player 2 is in an ultimatum

00:28:52.374 --> 00:28:54.368
game,
Player 2 will be making the

00:28:54.368 --> 00:28:57.114
offer and Player 2 says:
whatever cake is left I'm going

00:28:57.114 --> 00:28:59.960
to take all of it and you're
just going to get a $.01.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:06.959
So if we get into the second
stage then Player 2 will make

00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:12.541
this offer to Player 1.
Player 2 will say I'm going to

00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:17.145
keep the whole of the pie,
which in first period dollars

00:29:17.145 --> 00:29:20.377
is worth $δ.
So I'm going to end up with a

00:29:20.377 --> 00:29:22.900
payoff of δ
and you're going to end up with

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.599
a payoff of essentially nothing.
Player 2 knows that they can

00:29:27.599 --> 00:29:31.728
therefore get at least
$δ--or $δ

00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:36.562
in current day dollars
worth--from rejecting your

00:29:36.562 --> 00:29:39.783
offer.
Since they can get at least

00:29:39.783 --> 00:29:44.009
$δ current day offers from
rejecting your offer,

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:48.211
the lowest offer you can make
to them is an offer that gives

00:29:48.211 --> 00:29:52.538
them at least $δ.
So the offer you're going to

00:29:52.538 --> 00:29:57.120
make is this offer:
this is the two stage offer.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.569
It happens in the first stage.
Player 1 makes an offer that

00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:05.339
gives Player 2 what Player 2
could get in the second round,

00:30:05.339 --> 00:30:09.536
so gives Player 2 $δ
and keeps $[1 - δ]

00:30:09.536 --> 00:30:12.059
for herself.
Everyone understand the picture?

00:30:12.059 --> 00:30:15.279
So this picture is just
corresponding to this table.

00:30:15.279 --> 00:30:18.326
The thing people tend to get
confused about here,

00:30:18.326 --> 00:30:21.880
I think, is they get confused
between current dollars and

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.198
discounted dollars,
so we're going to do all the

00:30:25.198 --> 00:30:28.650
analysis here in terms of the
first period dollars,

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.089
dollars tomorrow are going to
be worth δ.

00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:33.619
There's a hand up,
can I get a shouting out?

00:30:33.619 --> 00:30:36.403
Yeah?
Student: [Inaudible]

00:30:36.403 --> 00:30:39.970
Professor Ben Polak:
Yes, sorry.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:47.853
So this is the outcome if it
was a one stage game and this is

00:30:47.853 --> 00:30:53.240
the outcome if it was a two
stage game.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.096
The offer is made and accepted.
Let's roll it forward,

00:30:57.096 --> 00:31:00.490
let's look at a three stage
game.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.380
Let's keep this picture handy
and think about a three stage

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.904
game.
So the beginning of the game is

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:10.858
the same.
We're going to look at three

00:31:10.858 --> 00:31:14.021
stage bargaining,
and the rules in three stage

00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:18.660
bargaining are pretty much the
same as in two stage bargaining,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.289
but now there's two possible
flips.

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:28.977
In three stage bargaining,
in the first period,

00:31:28.977 --> 00:31:35.228
in period one,
1 makes the offer and if it's

00:31:35.228 --> 00:31:42.066
accepted the game is over.
In period two,

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:49.848
if we reject,
then we go to period two when 2

00:31:49.848 --> 00:31:57.630
makes the offer and if it's
rejected now,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.029
this time by Player 1,
then we go to period three

00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:05.420
where once again 1 makes the
offer.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:09.363
So you can see where we're
heading, we're heading towards

00:32:09.363 --> 00:32:12.039
an alternate offer bargaining
model.

00:32:12.039 --> 00:32:13.668
I'm going to make an offer,
Jake's going to either accept

00:32:13.668 --> 00:32:15.529
or reject, then he'll make an
offer and we'll flip to and fro.

00:32:15.529 --> 00:32:18.744
There's a question,
let me try and get a mike out

00:32:18.744 --> 00:32:19.950
to the question.

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.818
Yeah?
Student: I have a

00:32:25.818 --> 00:32:29.305
question about the two player
game, if δ

00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:34.140
is the best that Player 2 can
get tomorrow then why wouldn't 1

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.390
offer Player 2 δ
discounted by δ

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:39.809
today?
Professor Ben Polak:

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:41.574
Good.
Right so I think I was

00:32:41.574 --> 00:32:44.250
confusing about it,
so let me make it clear.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:47.799
So tomorrow Player 2 can get
everything, everything that

00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:50.457
there is.
So whatever pie is left

00:32:50.457 --> 00:32:53.589
tomorrow Player 2 can get all of
it.

00:32:53.589 --> 00:32:59.315
So call that pie tomorrow 1 and
evaluate it in period one

00:32:59.315 --> 00:33:05.119
dollars as being worth $δ.
Does that make sense?

00:33:05.119 --> 00:33:08.220
Okay, so I think I misspoke on
that, so let me say it again.

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.732
So every period there's this
pie and every period,

00:33:11.732 --> 00:33:14.599
if it was the last period of
the game,

00:33:14.599 --> 00:33:18.422
the person making the offer is
going to get the whole pie,

00:33:18.422 --> 00:33:21.440
but if I view that pie tomorrow
from today,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.874
a pie of $1 tomorrow is only
worth $δ

00:33:25.874 --> 00:33:28.734
today.
A pie of $1 the day after

00:33:28.734 --> 00:33:33.203
tomorrow is only worth $δ
tomorrow and $δ²

00:33:33.203 --> 00:33:35.957
today and so on.
So that's the way in which

00:33:35.957 --> 00:33:37.670
we're going to do discounting
here.

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:42.114
Good, all right.
So in this game,

00:33:42.114 --> 00:33:45.710
if 1 makes an offer,
if it's accepted it's over.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:50.779
If it's accepted then we're
done.

00:33:50.779 --> 00:33:52.359
And if this offer's accepted
then we're done.

00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:53.920
And if this offer's accepted
then we're done.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.489
And in the third round,
if it's rejected then both

00:33:59.489 --> 00:34:04.039
players get nothing.
Once again we're going to

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:07.400
assume that the players are
discounting.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.409
So what does it mean to say
they're discounting?

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.639
It means that dollars in period
one are worth dollars,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:17.550
dollars in period two are
discounted by δ,

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:22.324
and dollars in period three are
discounted by δ

00:34:22.324 --> 00:34:26.349
x δ, or if you like by
δ².

00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:29.062
Just to put this into real
notions of money,

00:34:29.062 --> 00:34:31.460
if you think of δ
as being 90%,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.432
then $1 in period one is worth
$1, a $1 in period two viewed

00:34:36.432 --> 00:34:42.545
from period one is worth $.90,
and a $1 in period three viewed

00:34:42.545 --> 00:34:47.791
from period one is worth $.81.
Okay, so what do we think is

00:34:47.791 --> 00:34:50.597
going to happen here?
Well, once again we can do

00:34:50.597 --> 00:34:51.650
backward induction.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.790
Here we are in our picture.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:07.460
Let's look at the three-stage
game.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.092
Once again, when we analyze,
as always when we analyze these

00:35:11.092 --> 00:35:14.909
games using backward induction,
we want to start at the end.

00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:18.735
If we start at the end,
we know that the last stage,

00:35:18.735 --> 00:35:22.934
that's the third stage of the
three stage game looks like

00:35:22.934 --> 00:35:25.639
what?
It looks like a one stage game.

00:35:25.639 --> 00:35:30.539
In the one stage game we know
the offerer will get everything.

00:35:30.539 --> 00:35:33.918
Say it again,
so the last stage of the three

00:35:33.918 --> 00:35:38.475
stage game, we know the person
who makes the offer who this

00:35:38.475 --> 00:35:42.090
time will be Player 1 will get
everything.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.171
However, that everything is
only worth δ

00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:51.088
in period two dollars and it's
only worth δ²

00:35:51.088 --> 00:35:55.010
in period one dollars.
So in period one,

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:59.809
in the first period of this
game, we know that if their

00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:04.429
offer is rejected we know what's
going to happen.

00:36:04.429 --> 00:36:06.846
Say it again,
in the first period of this

00:36:06.846 --> 00:36:09.625
three stage game,
if the offer is rejected then

00:36:09.625 --> 00:36:13.927
we'll go into a two stage game,
and we already know what

00:36:13.927 --> 00:36:17.898
happens in a two stage game.
In a two stage game,

00:36:17.898 --> 00:36:21.484
the person who gets to make an
offer gets $[1 - δ]

00:36:21.484 --> 00:36:25.070
and the person who receives the
offer gets $δ.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:29.440
So we know in the first stage
of the game that the person who

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.664
receives the offer always has
the outside option of saying,

00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:37.565
no I reject.
And we know that that person

00:36:37.565 --> 00:36:42.856
tomorrow will get $[1 - δ].
But $[1 - δ]

00:36:42.856 --> 00:36:46.990
tomorrow is worth how much
today?

00:36:46.990 --> 00:36:54.547
It's worth $δ[1 - δ].
Tomorrow they're going to get

00:36:54.547 --> 00:36:58.816
$[1 - δ],
so today that's worth

00:36:58.816 --> 00:37:03.602
$δ[1--δ].
So the offer I have to make in

00:37:03.602 --> 00:37:07.806
the first round to make sure
that the other person accepts it

00:37:07.806 --> 00:37:11.099
has to be just better in
discounted dollars,

00:37:11.099 --> 00:37:12.340
than what they're going to get
tomorrow.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.075
They're going to get $[1 -
δ]

00:37:15.075 --> 00:37:19.219
tomorrow, so I have to give
them $δ[1--δ]

00:37:19.219 --> 00:37:24.690
today, which means I keep for
myself $[1 - δ[1--δ]].

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.914
And if you don't like the
algebra let's look at the

00:37:26.914 --> 00:37:28.854
picture.
In the picture,

00:37:28.854 --> 00:37:33.039
in the one stage game,
this is the offer.

00:37:33.039 --> 00:37:35.559
In the two stage game,
we know if we get to the second

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:38.554
round, Player 2 gets everything
so we have to give him that much

00:37:38.554 --> 00:37:41.916
today.
And if we get into the third

00:37:41.916 --> 00:37:46.865
round, now we're looking at
δ² here and

00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:49.030
δ² here.

00:37:52.219 --> 00:37:55.928
We know that if we get into the
third round the person who makes

00:37:55.928 --> 00:37:58.929
the offer in the third round
will get everything,

00:37:58.929 --> 00:38:02.239
so we can actually work our way
along.

00:38:02.239 --> 00:38:05.300
In the third round,
the person who makes the third

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:08.711
offer will get everything,
so in the second round you'd

00:38:08.711 --> 00:38:11.973
have to give them that much,
so in the first round you'd

00:38:11.973 --> 00:38:15.355
have to give Player 2 that much.
Say it again,

00:38:15.355 --> 00:38:20.073
in period three,
the person making the offer can

00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:23.050
get everything.
So in period two,

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:26.839
they must be getting δ
times that, so in period one

00:38:26.839 --> 00:38:29.869
you have to give them at least
this much.

00:38:29.869 --> 00:38:35.440
And this here is the offer
you'd make in the three stage

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.150
game.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.030
So in the picture we're just
doing a little zigzag;

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:49.600
on the chart we're also always
working across the diagonal.

00:38:53.079 --> 00:38:55.207
So we've done the one stage
game: the one stage game,

00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:57.090
the person making the offer
gets everything.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:00.246
In the two stage game,
the person making the offer

00:39:00.246 --> 00:39:04.111
offers just enough to get the
offer accepted which is $δ

00:39:04.111 --> 00:39:07.010
because that's what $1 is worth
tomorrow.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.561
In the three stage game,
the person making the offer

00:39:08.561 --> 00:39:09.960
makes just enough to get the
offer accepted,

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.465
which is δ
times what the receiver would

00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:15.418
get tomorrow.
What they get tomorrow is $[1 -

00:39:15.418 --> 00:39:17.990
δ], so they get
$δ[1--δ]

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.530
today.
How about the four stage game?

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:25.036
Let's see if we can do that.
So if we go to the four stage

00:39:25.036 --> 00:39:30.115
game now, in the four stage game
if the person receiving the

00:39:30.115 --> 00:39:35.561
offer rejects the offer,
then tomorrow they can get $[1

00:39:35.561 --> 00:39:40.467
- δ[1--δ]].
So I need to offer them enough

00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:45.441
now in current dollars so they
will prefer that to getting

00:39:45.441 --> 00:39:48.670
$[1--δ[1 - δ]]
tomorrow,

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:56.390
so how much must I offer them?
I have to offer them at least

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:00.817
δ times that much,
so I have to offer them

00:40:00.817 --> 00:40:04.860
$[δ x [1 - δ
x [1--δ]]].

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:13.059
Again, I'll keep the rest for
myself so I'll get $[1 -

00:40:13.059 --> 00:40:20.656
δ[1--δ[1--δ]]].
And so the principle is always

00:40:20.656 --> 00:40:25.860
give people just enough today so
they'll accept the offer,

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:30.140
and just enough today is
whatever they get tomorrow

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.110
discounted by δ.

00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:40.269
So actually this backward
induction isn't so bad.

00:40:40.269 --> 00:40:42.905
What makes it a little bit
easier is you don't actually,

00:40:42.905 --> 00:40:45.781
when you go through an extra
stage of this you don't actually

00:40:45.781 --> 00:40:47.889
have to go all the way to the
beginning,

00:40:47.889 --> 00:40:50.733
you could actually start where
you were last time and just

00:40:50.733 --> 00:40:52.280
discount once more by δ.

00:40:55.789 --> 00:41:00.120
Let's see if we can see any
kind of pattern emerging in this

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.010
algebra, so let's just multiply
out these brackets.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:10.439
In the four stage game,
this thing is actually equal

00:41:10.439 --> 00:41:15.986
to--just multiplying
through--it's 1 - δ

00:41:15.986 --> 00:41:21.281
+ δ²
- δ³--I hope it is

00:41:21.281 --> 00:41:24.489
anyway.
That's what this is.

00:41:24.489 --> 00:41:34.027
And this thing is equal to
δ - δ²

00:41:34.027 --> 00:41:41.941
+ δ³,
just multiplying out the

00:41:41.941 --> 00:41:46.928
brackets.
Does anyone see a pattern

00:41:46.928 --> 00:41:52.170
emerging here in these offers?
We had offers of 1 and then

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:54.291
1--δ.
We could also multiply out this

00:41:54.291 --> 00:41:58.544
one.
It might be helpful to do so:

00:41:58.544 --> 00:42:03.449
This is 1 - δ
+ δ².

00:42:03.449 --> 00:42:08.950
Anyone see a pattern what these
offers look like?

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:15.331
They kind of alternate.
So let's have a look,

00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:22.240
rather than do every stage.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.473
Should I do one more stage to
see if we can see a pattern

00:42:33.473 --> 00:42:36.098
emerging or should I jump
straight to ten stages and see

00:42:36.098 --> 00:42:38.670
what happens?
Go straight to ten people say?

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:43.010
Let's do one more,
nah, let's jump through to ten.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:47.696
So imagine that this game
actually had ten rounds,

00:42:47.696 --> 00:42:52.957
so this is a ten stage game,
and let's just continue our

00:42:52.957 --> 00:42:59.282
chart down here.
So here's--need a bit more

00:42:59.282 --> 00:43:06.070
space here--ten stages:
ten stage game.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:11.641
I'm going to continue my chart
and my chart says in the ten

00:43:11.641 --> 00:43:15.099
stage game what am I going to
get?

00:43:15.099 --> 00:43:22.733
So the offer is going to
be--it's going to be the same

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:27.486
pattern--1 - δ
+ δ²

00:43:27.486 --> 00:43:35.120
- δ³…
+ δ^(8) - δ^(9),

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.245
everyone see that?
So what I'm doing is I'm

00:43:38.245 --> 00:43:41.039
continuing the pattern from
above.

00:43:41.039 --> 00:43:44.163
So if I had ten stages,
I always start with a 1,

00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:47.221
the positive and negative terms
just alternate,

00:43:47.221 --> 00:43:51.010
and I have as many terms as 1
minus the stage I'm in.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:53.866
So in the four stage game,
I ended up with δ³,

00:43:53.866 --> 00:43:56.620
so in the ten stage game I'll
end up at δ^(9).

00:43:56.620 --> 00:44:03.306
Everyone happy with that?
So the four [error:

00:44:03.306 --> 00:44:05.489
ten]
stage offer is this slightly

00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:07.945
ugly thing, 1 - δ
+ δ²

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:11.630
- δ³…
+ δ^(4) - δ^(5),

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:17.790
etc., + δ^(8) - δ^(9).
That's a pretty ugly thing,

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:21.682
but fortunately some point in
high school you learned how to

00:44:21.682 --> 00:44:25.599
sum that thing.
Do you remember what this is?

00:44:25.599 --> 00:44:27.860
What do you call objects like
this in high school?

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:31.125
Anyone remember?
Objects like 1,

00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:34.197
δ, δ²,
δ³,

00:44:34.197 --> 00:44:37.360
δ^(4) what are they
called?

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:39.508
They're called geometric series
right, they're called geometric

00:44:39.508 --> 00:44:44.539
series.
Anyone remember how to sum them?

00:44:44.539 --> 00:44:51.486
We know that S is equal to
this, this is what the offer is,

00:44:51.486 --> 00:44:55.940
if there is ten rounds.
We know the offer is accepted.

00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:00.636
So the way to remember how to
sum it, the trick for summing it

00:45:00.636 --> 00:45:04.870
is to multiple both sides of
this equation by the common

00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:09.389
ratio,
so multiply both sides by

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:11.572
δ.
So if I multiply this side by

00:45:11.572 --> 00:45:13.469
δ, I'm going to multiply
the other side by δ.

00:45:13.469 --> 00:45:18.812
And this 1 will become a
δ, this δ

00:45:18.812 --> 00:45:24.278
will become a δ²,
this δ²

00:45:24.278 --> 00:45:29.783
will become a δ³,
this δ³

00:45:29.783 --> 00:45:33.090
will become a
δ^(4)….

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:38.420
There will be a -δ^(8)
coming from the seventh term.

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:44.181
There will be a +δ^(9)
coming from the δ^(8) term,

00:45:44.181 --> 00:45:47.600
and there will be a
-δ^(10).

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:50.250
Everyone okay with that?
I just multiplied everything

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.486
through by δ
and I just shifted along one

00:45:52.486 --> 00:45:54.534
for convenience.
What do I do now,

00:45:54.534 --> 00:45:58.800
anyone remember?
Add the two lines together.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:10.115
So by summing this side I get
[1 + δ]

00:46:10.115 --> 00:46:13.545
S^(10).
On the other side,

00:46:13.545 --> 00:46:16.120
what's kind of convenient is
everything cancels.

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:21.966
The 1 comes through, I get a 1.
These two terms cancel and

00:46:21.966 --> 00:46:23.880
these two terms cancel,
and these two terms cancel,

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:30.609
and so on and so on,
all the way up to the end where

00:46:30.609 --> 00:46:34.139
I get -δ^(10).
Everyone okay.

00:46:34.139 --> 00:46:36.309
All the other terms have
cancelled out.

00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:42.747
 So now just sorting out my
algebra a bit--I'm going to take

00:46:42.747 --> 00:46:48.572
it on the other side--I'm going
to have that the offer you

00:46:48.572 --> 00:46:54.907
make--this is what you're going
to get to keep--so the amount I

00:46:54.907 --> 00:47:01.345
claim I should keep in the first
round is [1 - δ^(10])/[1 +

00:47:01.345 --> 00:47:03.991
δ].
Just be a bit careful with the

00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:05.880
notation here because it may be
a little bit confusing.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.245
The 10 here doesn't mean to the
tenth power, it's just the offer

00:47:09.245 --> 00:47:11.650
in the tenth round [error:
ten-round game],

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:15.519
whereas the 10 here really does
mean in the tenth power.

00:47:15.519 --> 00:47:20.546
So if we play this game for ten
rounds, the offer you'd make

00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.783
would be [1 - δ^(10)]/[1 +
δ]

00:47:23.783 --> 00:47:28.980
which means the amount you're
offering to the other side,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:41.010
which is 1 - S would be [δ
+ δ^(10)]/[1 + δ].

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.774
So to summarize where we are:
we started off by considering a

00:47:47.774 --> 00:47:50.154
very simple game,
a one stage take it or leave it

00:47:50.154 --> 00:47:51.725
offer.
We know that,

00:47:51.725 --> 00:47:56.191
in that take it or leave it
offer, Player 1 is going to

00:47:56.191 --> 00:48:01.320
claim everything for herself and
offer nothing to Player 2.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:05.605
Then we considered a two stage
game which was the same as the

00:48:05.605 --> 00:48:09.820
one stage game except that if
Player 2 rejects the offer,

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.789
he--let's call player 2,
"he"--he gets to make an offer

00:48:14.789 --> 00:48:18.010
to Player 1 in the second
period.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:21.276
We know that in the second
period of that two stage game

00:48:21.276 --> 00:48:23.829
Player 2 can keep everything for
himself.

00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:27.666
Everything for himself tomorrow
is worth δ

00:48:27.666 --> 00:48:31.503
today, so you have to offer him
at least δ

00:48:31.503 --> 00:48:35.090
today and keep 1 - δ
for yourself.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.260
Then we looked at a three stage
game.

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.997
In this three stage game,
if Player 2 rejects in the

00:48:39.997 --> 00:48:43.003
first round, Player 2 can make
you an offer in the second

00:48:43.003 --> 00:48:45.017
round,
but now if you're Player 1 and

00:48:45.017 --> 00:48:47.823
you reject in the second round
you get to make an offer to

00:48:47.823 --> 00:48:51.245
Player 2 in the third round.
We argued that in the second

00:48:51.245 --> 00:48:54.563
round of this game,
if Player 2 rejects you in the

00:48:54.563 --> 00:48:58.219
first round and makes an offer
in the second round,

00:48:58.219 --> 00:49:03.762
it'll be in a two stage game
and they'll be able to keep 1 -

00:49:03.762 --> 00:49:07.050
δ of the pie for
themselves.

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.772
So you have to offer them at
least δ x [1--δ]

00:49:09.772 --> 00:49:12.544
today for them to accept the
offer, keeping the rest for

00:49:12.544 --> 00:49:14.724
yourself.
Then we looked at a four stage

00:49:14.724 --> 00:49:16.405
game.
In the four stage game if

00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:19.429
Player 2 rejects your offer,
he can make you an offer,

00:49:19.429 --> 00:49:21.438
but if you reject the offer you
can make him an offer,

00:49:21.438 --> 00:49:23.559
but if he rejects that offer he
can make you an offer.

00:49:23.559 --> 00:49:27.233
And once again we asked how
much do I have to offer Player 2

00:49:27.233 --> 00:49:29.599
now for him to accept the offer
now?

00:49:29.599 --> 00:49:35.366
He knows that if he rejects the
offer, he can get this amount

00:49:35.366 --> 00:49:38.730
1--δ x [1--δ]
tomorrow.

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.803
So I have to offer him δ
times that today,

00:49:42.803 --> 00:49:46.699
and once again I keep the same
for myself.

00:49:46.699 --> 00:49:48.030
That's just a summary of what
we did.

00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:49.929
And then what we did was we
cheated.

00:49:49.929 --> 00:49:51.723
We jumped to the tenth stage
[error: ten stages],

00:49:51.723 --> 00:49:53.329
just noticing that a pattern
had emerged,

00:49:53.329 --> 00:49:55.367
and we found that in the tenth
stage [error:

00:49:55.367 --> 00:49:57.452
ten-stage game],
this is the offer you'd make

00:49:57.452 --> 00:49:59.300
just according to the same
pattern.

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.463
And it was this horrible thing,
and then we used a little bit

00:50:02.463 --> 00:50:04.730
of high school math to simply
this thing.

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.508
And it turns out this is the
amount you keep for yourself and

00:50:08.508 --> 00:50:11.280
this is the offer you'll make to
Player 2.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.559
In each case I've accepted--Did
I make a math mistake?

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:18.289
Thank you.
Let's put a superscript in

00:50:18.289 --> 00:50:21.880
here.
good.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.167
So what do we observe here?
So the first thing to observe

00:50:26.167 --> 00:50:29.742
is in the one stage game if we
believe backward induction you

00:50:29.742 --> 00:50:32.840
certainly want to be the person
making the offer.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.360
In the one stage game,
in the ultimatum game,

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.480
there's a huge first-mover
advantage.

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.250
In the two stage game it's not
clear if you want to make the

00:50:42.250 --> 00:50:44.269
offer, it depends on how large
δ is,

00:50:44.269 --> 00:50:47.867
but if δ
is a big number like .9 you'd

00:50:47.867 --> 00:50:51.550
rather be the person receiving
the offer.

00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:56.187
In the three stage game,
it looks like you'd probably

00:50:56.187 --> 00:51:00.380
rather make the offer,
but it's not so clear.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.304
So where does it go to as we go
down the path,

00:51:03.304 --> 00:51:06.230
as it goes down towards the ten
stage game?

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.454
It looks like in the ten stage
game you'd probably still prefer

00:51:10.454 --> 00:51:13.170
to make the offer than not,
but they're certainly much

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:14.280
closer together than they were
before.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.440
Some of that initial bargaining
power has been washed out by the

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:23.976
fact that there are ten stages.
So let's try and push this just

00:51:23.976 --> 00:51:28.298
a little bit harder.
Instead of looking at the tenth

00:51:28.298 --> 00:51:32.130
stage offer, what if we look at
the infinite stage offer.

00:51:32.130 --> 00:51:41.429
So in principle we look at the
infinite stage of this game.

00:51:41.429 --> 00:51:43.243
So I can make you an offer,
you can say no and make me an

00:51:43.243 --> 00:51:44.960
offer, and then I can reject and
make you an offer,

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.861
and then you can reject and
make me an offer,

00:51:47.861 --> 00:51:51.300
and so on and so forth.
So we look at this term.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.258
If in principle and you can
make an infinite number of

00:51:54.258 --> 00:51:57.607
offers--so, what's this term
going to look like if I can make

00:51:57.607 --> 00:52:01.984
an infinite number of offers?
So I claim it's going to look

00:52:01.984 --> 00:52:06.004
like this [1 - δ^(∞)]
/ [1 + δ]

00:52:06.004 --> 00:52:09.936
and over here,
at least it's going to converge

00:52:09.936 --> 00:52:14.671
towards this.
We'll be a bit more formal,

00:52:14.671 --> 00:52:20.642
and over here we'll have
[δ + δ^(∞)]

00:52:20.642 --> 00:52:25.626
/ [1 + δ].
However now I get a little bit

00:52:25.626 --> 00:52:30.699
simpler.
What is δ^(∞)?

00:52:30.699 --> 00:52:34.500
It's 0 right,
so .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x.

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.269
9 x .9 x .9 x .9 x …
is 0.

00:52:37.269 --> 00:52:45.569
So this last term disappears as
does this one,

00:52:45.569 --> 00:52:51.286
and we just get 1 / [1 +
δ]

00:52:51.286 --> 00:52:58.929
and δ / [1 + δ].
So if we make alternating offer

00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:02.943
bargaining--a bargaining game
where in each round I make you

00:53:02.943 --> 00:53:05.328
an offer,
you can accept it or you can

00:53:05.328 --> 00:53:08.633
reject and make me an offer,
and we imagine there's no bound

00:53:08.633 --> 00:53:11.685
to this game,
it just goes on arbitrarily

00:53:11.685 --> 00:53:15.037
long--then our prediction is
that Player 1,

00:53:15.037 --> 00:53:19.906
the person who makes the first
offer will get 1 / [1 + δ]

00:53:19.906 --> 00:53:23.577
of the initial pie and Player 2
will get δ

00:53:23.577 --> 00:53:26.849
/ [1 + δ]
of the initial pie.

00:53:26.849 --> 00:53:29.969
Let's try and get a handle
about what those numbers are.

00:53:29.969 --> 00:53:34.422
So if you imagine these offers
can be made fairly rapidly,

00:53:34.422 --> 00:53:37.389
for example,
I can make offer today,

00:53:37.389 --> 00:53:39.730
you can make an offer back to
me in half an hour's time,

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.156
and then I can make an offer
back to you in half an hour's

00:53:42.156 --> 00:53:44.487
time,
then it's reasonable to assume

00:53:44.487 --> 00:53:47.150
that the pie is not shrinking
very fast.

00:53:47.150 --> 00:53:51.139
The discount factor is not a
big deal here.

00:53:51.139 --> 00:53:54.010
So these offers can be made in
rapid succession,

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:57.429
but we might think that δ
itself is approximately 1:

00:53:57.429 --> 00:53:59.750
the pie isn't shrinking very
fast.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:04.526
If δ is approximately 1,
and if we take δ

00:54:04.526 --> 00:54:10.163
to 1 here--the time isn't that
valuable given how rapidly we

00:54:10.163 --> 00:54:16.659
can make offers to and fro--then
what does this make this equal?

00:54:16.659 --> 00:54:20.019
In the case where δ
is equal to 1 what do we get?

00:54:20.019 --> 00:54:29.739
We get 1/2, which means this
will also be 1/2.

00:54:29.739 --> 00:54:32.110
So we learned something from
this which is kind of

00:54:32.110 --> 00:54:33.889
surprising.
If you do alternating

00:54:33.889 --> 00:54:36.572
offers--the sort of standard,
very natural game of

00:54:36.572 --> 00:54:39.912
bargaining--sort of the kind of
bargaining you might do in the

00:54:39.912 --> 00:54:41.329
bazaar,
in a market,

00:54:41.329 --> 00:54:44.748
or the kind of bargaining you
might imagine going on in

00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:48.293
negotiations between baseball
players or their agents and

00:54:48.293 --> 00:54:50.166
teams,
or general managers of

00:54:50.166 --> 00:54:53.323
teams--in which offers just go
to and fro and they go to and

00:54:53.323 --> 00:54:55.802
fro fairly rapidly,
and in principle they could

00:54:55.802 --> 00:55:00.069
make lots and lots of offers.
In principle--what this moral

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:05.610
tells us is, in principle,
we're going to end up with each

00:55:05.610 --> 00:55:10.179
side splitting whatever the pie
was equally.

00:55:10.179 --> 00:55:13.714
Very, very different from the
ultimatum game where all the

00:55:13.714 --> 00:55:17.560
bargaining power was on the
person who made the first offer.

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:21.230
So what are the lessons here?

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.340
What can we conclude from this?

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:38.597
We've looked at alternating
offer bargaining,

00:55:38.597 --> 00:55:45.529
and we've concluded,
under special conditions,

00:55:45.529 --> 00:55:52.769
we've concluded that you get an
even split.

00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:56.088
You get an even share,
an even split,

00:55:56.088 --> 00:56:00.420
a fifty-fifty split if three
things are true.

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:06.841
The first thing is there's
potentially infinitely many

00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:11.930
offers: potentially can bargain
forever.

00:56:15.929 --> 00:56:21.619
And if discounting is not a big
deal.

00:56:21.619 --> 00:56:23.659
What does discounting really
not being a big deal means?

00:56:23.659 --> 00:56:26.710
It means those offers can be
made in rapid succession.

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:33.866
So no discounting,
or if you like,

00:56:33.866 --> 00:56:38.596
rapid offers.
If you have to wait a year

00:56:38.596 --> 00:56:41.945
between every offer then that
discount factor would be a big

00:56:41.945 --> 00:56:44.238
deal.
But I actually made a third

00:56:44.238 --> 00:56:47.440
assumption, and I made it
without telling you.

00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.280
What was the third assumption I
made?

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.400
I snuck the third assumption
past you without telling you.

00:56:53.400 --> 00:57:01.539
What was that third assumption?
Let me get the mike here.

00:57:01.539 --> 00:57:03.780
So I claim I snuck a third
assumption.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.900
There's somebody,
let me start over here.

00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.827
What was the third assumption?
Student: I don't know if

00:57:07.827 --> 00:57:09.293
this is what you're looking for
but they know how big the pie

00:57:09.293 --> 00:57:10.269
is.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:10.269 --> 00:57:11.528
They know how big the pie is,
that's true,

00:57:11.528 --> 00:57:13.025
that's a big deal actually.
That's true,

00:57:13.025 --> 00:57:15.040
but there's something else
going on here.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.452
What is it?
Student: We assume that

00:57:17.452 --> 00:57:18.943
both players were rational.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:57:18.943 --> 00:57:19.863
We assumed that.
That's true,

00:57:19.863 --> 00:57:22.262
but we've kind of been assuming
that throughout backward

00:57:22.262 --> 00:57:24.190
induction.
You're right none of this

00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:27.454
backward induction would apply
so cleanly if we didn't assume

00:57:27.454 --> 00:57:31.250
that.
What else do I assume?

00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:33.719
It's hidden actually,
I snuck it in.

00:57:33.719 --> 00:57:36.430
We assume the discount factor
is a constant,

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:38.762
that's true,
but not just constant but

00:57:38.762 --> 00:57:40.920
something else.
You're on the right lines.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:44.247
They're the same.
I've assumed here,

00:57:44.247 --> 00:57:49.121
implicitly, I've assumed that
both people are equally

00:57:49.121 --> 00:57:55.605
impatient,
they have the same discount

00:57:55.605 --> 00:58:05.160
factor, δ_1 =
δ_2.

00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.827
Why does that matter?
Well let's just think about it

00:58:07.827 --> 00:58:10.650
intuitively a second.
Suppose that one of these

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:13.160
players is very,
very impatient.

00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:16.220
They need the money now.
If it's cake,

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:20.005
they need the cake now.
They're very impatient,

00:58:20.005 --> 00:58:22.840
and the other person is very
patient.

00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.420
They can wait forever to get
this bargain to come across.

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:29.810
Who do you think is going to do
better, the patient player or

00:58:29.810 --> 00:58:33.766
the impatient player?
The patient player is going to

00:58:33.766 --> 00:58:35.972
do better.
The way we ended up,

00:58:35.972 --> 00:58:39.054
the way we did all this
analysis is we assumed that

00:58:39.054 --> 00:58:41.519
those discount factors were the
same.

00:58:41.519 --> 00:58:44.843
We assumed that each person was
discounting time at the same

00:58:44.843 --> 00:58:48.224
rate, perhaps because they were
facing the same bank with the

00:58:48.224 --> 00:58:50.501
same interest rate.
But in practice,

00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:54.057
often one side is going to be
in a hurry to get the dispute

00:58:54.057 --> 00:58:57.429
resolved, and the other side can
sit around forever.

00:58:57.429 --> 00:59:00.445
In that world,
the side who could sit around

00:59:00.445 --> 00:59:03.039
forever is going to do much
better.

00:59:03.039 --> 00:59:08.187
Now, we're going to look at
relaxing this assumption and

00:59:08.187 --> 00:59:13.521
this assumption in particular
we're going to relax it on a

00:59:13.521 --> 00:59:17.886
homework exercise.
So in your homework exercise

00:59:17.886 --> 00:59:23.075
you're going to try redoing part
of this analysis--good practice

00:59:23.075 --> 00:59:27.276
anyway--but doing it in a
setting where the discount

00:59:27.276 --> 00:59:31.524
factors are different.
So one thing we learned here

00:59:31.524 --> 00:59:35.935
was: yes, you get an even split,
but it depends on these three

00:59:35.935 --> 00:59:38.741
assumptions.
It's kind of important because

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:42.299
when you think about bargaining,
I think a lot of people simply

00:59:42.299 --> 00:59:45.570
assume intuitively that whatever
the bargain is about,

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.510
people will eventually split in
the middle.

00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:49.175
When you're bargaining about a
house, or the price you're going

00:59:49.175 --> 00:59:50.539
to pay for a house,
all these things,

00:59:50.539 --> 00:59:53.264
you kind of implicitly have
this assumption you're going to

00:59:53.264 --> 00:59:56.055
end up splitting the difference.
What I'm arguing here is you

00:59:56.055 --> 00:59:58.469
will split the difference in
this natural bargaining game,

00:59:58.469 --> 01:00:02.822
but only under very special
assumptions, and in particular,

01:00:02.822 --> 01:00:05.900
the assumption of patience is
critical.

01:00:10.269 --> 01:00:12.951
There's another remarkable
thing here though,

01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:15.543
it's also hidden.
So not only did we end up with

01:00:15.543 --> 01:00:17.599
an even split,
but something else remarkable

01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:19.320
happened in this bargaining
game.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.862
What was the other thing?
Somewhat amazingly,

01:00:21.862 --> 01:00:25.377
a very unrealistic thing that
occurred in this bargaining

01:00:25.377 --> 01:00:27.219
game?
See if you can spot it.

01:00:27.219 --> 01:00:30.813
So one thing was an assumption
I made and the other is actually

01:00:30.813 --> 01:00:32.030
a prediction.
Yeah.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:34.063
Student: The first offer
will be the offer that's

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.097
accepted.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:36.579
Good.
Did everyone see that?

01:00:36.579 --> 01:00:39.923
So in this bargaining game,
I set it up as alternating

01:00:39.923 --> 01:00:42.762
offer bargaining,
so the image you had in your

01:00:42.762 --> 01:00:45.422
mind was of haggling.
I made an offer,

01:00:45.422 --> 01:00:47.790
you guys thought about this
offer.

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:49.929
Should I take this offer or not.
Maybe I won't take this offer.

01:00:49.929 --> 01:00:53.564
You make an offer back to me,
and we kind of haggled to and

01:00:53.564 --> 01:00:54.821
fro.
But actually,

01:00:54.821 --> 01:00:58.550
in the equilibrium of the game,
none of that happened.

01:00:58.550 --> 01:01:01.578
That all happened in our mind.
We thought about what offer we

01:01:01.578 --> 01:01:04.325
would make, and we thought about
what offer you would make back

01:01:04.325 --> 01:01:07.159
to me if I made you this offer
and you rejected it and so on.

01:01:07.159 --> 01:01:10.592
We did this backward induction
exercise but it was all in our

01:01:10.592 --> 01:01:16.231
heads.
In this game the actual

01:01:16.231 --> 01:01:24.566
prediction is:
the very first offer is

01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:29.483
accepted.
There's no haggling,

01:01:29.483 --> 01:01:34.369
there's no bargaining.
Now that doesn't seem very

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:37.250
realistic, there's no haggling.

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:48.799
Backward induction suggests
that we should never see

01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:52.889
bargaining, never see the actual
process of bargaining.

01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:57.170
What you should see is an offer
is made and it's accepted.

01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:02.110
Now what is it about the real
world that allows for haggling

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:05.036
to take place?
If this was a model of the real

01:02:05.036 --> 01:02:07.237
world and we believed in
backward induction,

01:02:07.237 --> 01:02:10.131
then we're done.
So why is it in fact in the

01:02:10.131 --> 01:02:13.619
real world we see people make
offers to and fro?

01:02:13.619 --> 01:02:18.480
What's different about the real
world than this model?

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.803
Let's talk about it a bit.
You must have all bargained for

01:02:23.803 --> 01:02:26.486
something in the real world.
None of you have probably

01:02:26.486 --> 01:02:28.594
bargained for a house yet,
but you might have bargained

01:02:28.594 --> 01:02:31.217
for a car or something.
In the real world you make

01:02:31.217 --> 01:02:33.010
offers go to and fro,
right?

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:35.334
What's going on?
Why are we getting offers in

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:38.020
the real world whereas we don't
in this game?

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:45.821
What are we missing?
Student: In the real

01:02:45.821 --> 01:02:47.452
world you don't actually know
what the other person's discount

01:02:47.452 --> 01:02:49.078
factor is,
therefore, you have uncertainly

01:02:49.078 --> 01:02:51.099
as to what your highest possible
offer could be.

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:53.145
Professor Ben Polak:
Good.

01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:56.405
So in the real world,
unlike the model on the board,

01:02:56.405 --> 01:02:59.729
not only are those discount
factors different but you

01:02:59.729 --> 01:03:04.139
probably don't know how patient
or impatient the other side is.

01:03:04.139 --> 01:03:06.967
You can get some ideas about
how patient or impatient the

01:03:06.967 --> 01:03:09.442
other side is by looking at
their characteristics,

01:03:09.442 --> 01:03:10.713
for example.
For example,

01:03:10.713 --> 01:03:12.800
if you know that the person
you're bargaining with over

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.925
their car--you're trying to buy
their car--and they're a

01:03:14.925 --> 01:03:16.780
graduate student who's just a
got a job in,

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:18.468
I don't know,
Uzbekistan or something,

01:03:18.468 --> 01:03:21.070
and they aren't going to be
taking their car with them,

01:03:21.070 --> 01:03:24.179
and they're leaving next week,
you know they're in a hurry.

01:03:24.179 --> 01:03:26.297
So there's times when you're
going to know something about

01:03:26.297 --> 01:03:28.716
other people's discount factors,
how patient they are,

01:03:28.716 --> 01:03:31.139
but lots of times you're not
going to know.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:35.187
So one thing is you just don't
know what the discount factor

01:03:35.187 --> 01:03:37.489
is.
By the way, what else might you

01:03:37.489 --> 01:03:43.719
not know about the other side?
What else might you not know?

01:03:43.719 --> 01:03:45.869
Student: How big the
surplus is they were splitting.

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:47.080
Professor Ben Polak:
Good.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.010
You might not know this good
that you're selling.

01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:52.501
We've been talking about the
big one pie which you're carving

01:03:52.501 --> 01:03:55.119
up, and everyone knows the size
of the pie.

01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:58.421
But in the real world,
I might not know this object

01:03:58.421 --> 01:04:01.590
that's being sold,
I might not know how much this

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:04.099
object is worth to the other
side,

01:04:04.099 --> 01:04:08.050
and he or she may not know how
much it's worth to me.

01:04:08.050 --> 01:04:12.988
So that lack of information is
going to change the game

01:04:12.988 --> 01:04:15.536
considerably.
In particular,

01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:20.661
I might want to turn down some
offers in this game in order to

01:04:20.661 --> 01:04:24.875
appear like a patient person.
Why I might want to turn down

01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:27.978
some offers in the game in order
to appear like somebody who

01:04:27.978 --> 01:04:30.239
doesn't really value this all
very much.

01:04:30.239 --> 01:04:33.647
And in so doing,
I'm going to try and get you to

01:04:33.647 --> 01:04:37.126
make me a better offer.
So what's going on in haggling

01:04:37.126 --> 01:04:39.292
and bargaining,
according to this model,

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:42.476
what's missing in this model,
is the idea that you don't know

01:04:42.476 --> 01:04:44.019
who it is you're bargaining
with.

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:47.215
You don't know how much they
value the objects in question.,

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:50.302
You don't know how impatient
they are to get away with the

01:04:50.302 --> 01:04:53.135
cash.
So it's a big assumption here,

01:04:53.135 --> 01:04:57.199
a very big assumption,
is that everything is known.

01:04:57.199 --> 01:05:11.895
So both the size of the pie,
let's call it the value of the

01:05:11.895 --> 01:05:25.070
pie, and the value of time is
assumed to be known,

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.807
but in the real world you
typically don't know the value

01:05:27.807 --> 01:05:31.631
of the pie on the other side,
and you typically don't know

01:05:31.631 --> 01:05:34.664
how much they value time.
So that produces a whole

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.683
literature on bargaining,
none of which we really have

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:38.615
time to do in this class,
which is a pity because

01:05:38.615 --> 01:05:41.269
bargaining's kind of important.
So instead, I want to spend the

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:43.748
last five minutes just
introducing, is it really worth

01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:46.179
introducing a new topic in the
last five minutes?

01:05:46.179 --> 01:05:50.160
No, I think it is,
let me talk a little bit more

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.210
about bargaining rather than
that.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:58.046
So what does this suggest if
we're going out in the real

01:05:58.046 --> 01:06:00.857
world?
I'm actually taking this to

01:06:00.857 --> 01:06:03.521
reality.
So one thing it suggests is

01:06:03.521 --> 01:06:07.153
people for whom it's known that
they're going to be

01:06:07.153 --> 01:06:11.730
impatient--people for whom it's
known that they desperately need

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:15.507
this deal to go through--are
going to do less well in

01:06:15.507 --> 01:06:17.973
bargains.
We already know people may do

01:06:17.973 --> 01:06:20.535
less well in bargaining because
they're less sophisticated

01:06:20.535 --> 01:06:22.351
players,
but here it isn't that they're

01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:24.731
less sophisticated--they can be
as sophisticated as you

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:26.889
like--but they're just going to
be in a hurry.

01:06:26.889 --> 01:06:30.933
We already talked about the
graduate student whose leaving

01:06:30.933 --> 01:06:33.771
for Uzbekistan,
but who else typically in

01:06:33.771 --> 01:06:36.679
bargaining is going to need cash
now?

01:06:36.679 --> 01:06:38.811
Who else is going to be in a
weaker position in their

01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:40.370
bargaining, socially in our
society?

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.429
Student: When labor
management disputes labor.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:51.349
Professor Ben Polak:
So that's a good question.

01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:53.965
That's a good question in labor
management disputes--there's one

01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:56.289
going on right now in
Hollywood--it's not clear there.

01:06:56.289 --> 01:06:59.863
It could be,
it could be the management side

01:06:59.863 --> 01:07:04.933
who's in a hurry because they
just need right now to get David

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:08.774
Letterman's script written.
That would tend to favor labor,

01:07:08.774 --> 01:07:11.700
but it could be the labor side.
Why might it be the labor side?

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.140
Does everyone know this?
There's a writer's strike going

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.771
on in Hollywood right now,
so the people on the management

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:19.449
side who are in the weakest
position are the people who are

01:07:19.449 --> 01:07:21.480
in the most hurry to get this
resolved,

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:24.095
and those are the guys with the
fewest scripts in the pipeline,

01:07:24.095 --> 01:07:25.909
and that tends to be late night
TV shows.

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:27.929
So those guys really want this
thing settled fast.

01:07:27.929 --> 01:07:30.349
They're in a weak bargaining
position.

01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:32.142
On the other hand,
there may be a reason why

01:07:32.142 --> 01:07:33.809
labor's in a weak bargaining
position.

01:07:33.809 --> 01:07:37.456
Why might labor be in a weak
bargaining position relative to

01:07:37.456 --> 01:07:38.260
management?

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.941
They have rents to pay.
They have immediate demands on

01:07:44.941 --> 01:07:47.723
their cash.
The typical worker is typically

01:07:47.723 --> 01:07:50.593
poorer than your typical
manager, not always but

01:07:50.593 --> 01:07:53.280
typically, and they have to pay
the rent.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.590
They have to feed their
children.

01:07:56.590 --> 01:07:58.489
So there's a more general idea
there.

01:07:58.489 --> 01:08:01.914
More generally in bargaining,
the people who are poorer,

01:08:01.914 --> 01:08:05.090
typically--it isn't just poor
in terms of income,

01:08:05.090 --> 01:08:08.228
it's poor in terms of
wealth--are going to be more

01:08:08.228 --> 01:08:10.469
impatient to get things
resolved;

01:08:10.469 --> 01:08:14.019
and that's going to put them in
a weaker bargaining position.

01:08:14.019 --> 01:08:18.894
So in bilateral bargaining,
having low wealth and being

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:24.039
known to have low wealth puts
you in a weaker position.

01:08:24.039 --> 01:08:27.516
And that means that typically
people who are poorer are going

01:08:27.516 --> 01:08:30.239
to do less well,
although the late night TV show

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:33.351
may be an exception.
It makes you think a little bit

01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:36.682
about whether adjusting up a
bargaining position makes things

01:08:36.682 --> 01:08:38.981
equal for everybody.
Any other thoughts about who

01:08:38.981 --> 01:08:40.770
has strength and who has
weakness in bargaining?

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:45.859
What other kind of stunts do we
see people do in bargaining?

01:08:45.859 --> 01:08:47.688
What else is kind of missing
here when you think about a

01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.683
particular--what we want to do
in this class is develop these

01:08:49.683 --> 01:08:51.079
ideas and take them to the real
world,

01:08:51.079 --> 01:08:57.939
so what other real world things
here are kind of missing?

01:08:57.939 --> 01:09:00.547
Student: Usually people
will make their first offer a

01:09:00.547 --> 01:09:03.109
lot higher than what they're
actually willing to accept.

01:09:03.109 --> 01:09:05.641
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so typically,

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:08.010
you're right,
typically bargaining isn't just

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:11.585
a series of random numbers,
typically people start out high

01:09:11.585 --> 01:09:15.090
and then they concede towards
the middle, is that right?

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:18.234
So if I'm the buyer I start out
with a low price and come up,

01:09:18.234 --> 01:09:21.326
and if you're the seller you
start off with a high price and

01:09:21.326 --> 01:09:24.191
come down.
So again that seems to be about

01:09:24.191 --> 01:09:28.042
establishing reputation and
trying to indicate how much I

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:30.840
want this good.
There's something worth saying

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.441
here which we haven't got time
to do in this class,

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:36.770
and I hope you all have time to
take the follow up class 156.

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:40.366
We can actually show formally
that in a setting in which

01:09:40.366 --> 01:09:42.720
buyers and sellers are
bargaining,

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:46.319
and buyers and sellers do not
know how much the good is worth

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:49.319
to the buyer or how much it
costs to the seller,

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:52.830
typically you cannot expect to
get efficiency.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:54.862
Let me say it again.
So it's kind of an important

01:09:54.862 --> 01:09:57.740
economic fact that's missing
from 115 and unfortunately

01:09:57.740 --> 01:10:00.536
missing from this class,
but if we go to a more real

01:10:00.536 --> 01:10:03.250
world setting in which people's
values are not known,

01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:05.886
not only are the offers not
accepted immediately and not

01:10:05.886 --> 01:10:08.714
only is there some inequity in
that the poor tend to be more

01:10:08.714 --> 01:10:12.188
impatient and do less well,
but also you get bad

01:10:12.188 --> 01:10:14.833
inefficiency.
The inefficiency occurs

01:10:14.833 --> 01:10:18.158
essentially because the sellers
want to seem like they're hard

01:10:18.158 --> 01:10:20.829
and the buyers want to seem like
they're hard,

01:10:20.829 --> 01:10:25.750
and you get a failure for deals
to be made.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:28.495
So some deals are actually
going to be lost or take a long

01:10:28.495 --> 01:10:30.373
time in coming,
you're going to get some

01:10:30.373 --> 01:10:33.359
strikes before the deals occur
and that's all inefficient.

01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:35.566
So bargaining,
not in this model,

01:10:35.566 --> 01:10:39.289
but in the real world tends to
lead to inefficiency.

01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:41.415
So I'll leave it there,
we'll have an earlyish lunch

01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:44.000
since we're all starving because
of the clock change anyway.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.337
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Today I wanted

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:08.499
to begin with that question I
left you with:

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.691
What does Housekeeping
have to do with the Identity

00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.915
Plot?
Did you see elements of the

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:22.540
Identity Plot in this novel?
Who did and what did you see?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.213
Yes.
What did you

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:25.615
see?Student:
Ohâ€¦Professor

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:26.360
Amy Hungerford:
Oh.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.957
Now you have to make good.
Yeah.

00:00:28.957 --> 00:00:32.727
Student:
Well--Professor Amy

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:36.330
Hungerford: I can come back
to you.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.993
Student:
Would you?Professor

00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:37.510
Amy Hungerford:
Yes, I would.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.360
I would be quite happy to do
that.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.713
Is someone else more ready to
say what this novel has to do

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:46.824
with the Identity Plot?
Yes.Student:

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:50.397
Well, outwardly speaking
Ruth struggles with her own

00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:54.425
identity and how to fit it into
societal conceptions of what it

00:00:54.425 --> 00:00:57.887
means to be a normal person,
to have a home and function in

00:00:57.887 --> 00:01:00.390
society.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Absolutely.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.976
And what details,
for you, most mark that

00:01:05.976 --> 00:01:09.857
conflict in Ruth?
Where do you see that

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:13.014
happening?Student:
Well, you see it a lot in

00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:15.227
her hair and in her dress.
Professor Amy Hungerford:

00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:16.209
In her hair and her dress.
Yes.

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:21.725
So, by contrast with Ruth,
you see Lucille doing a lot of

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.959
work on her hair,
trying to make clothes,

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.818
become close with the home
economics teacher,

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:34.905
chiding Ruth for not looking
normal when they walk down the

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:37.569
street.
So, you really do see it in

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.025
that dynamic,
especially between the two

00:01:40.025 --> 00:01:42.480
sisters, and,
as you say, in clothes and

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.629
hair.
Where else do you see this?

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:51.080
That sense of being at odds is
one part of it.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.523
Where else do you see it?
Okay.

00:01:54.523 --> 00:01:56.770
You're not talkative today.
Let's try something easier.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.564
I'd like to read the first
sentence of the novel:

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:12.814
"My name is Ruth."
What can we say about that

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:16.560
sentence as the opening sentence
of a novel?

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.169
Any thoughts or observations
about it?

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:21.228
Yes.
Student: It recalls

00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:22.533
Moby-Dick.
Professor Amy

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:24.919
Hungerford: Yes.
It absolutely does.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.763
And what's the first line of
Moby-Dick?

00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:28.729
Students:
"Call me Ishmael."

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.044
Professor Amy
Hungerford: "Call me--" Oh,

00:02:30.044 --> 00:02:30.870
in chorus.
That was beautiful.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.745
So, you may have read
Moby-Dick, even if

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:38.572
you didn't read this.
So, "call me Ishmael." Okay.

00:02:38.572 --> 00:02:41.822
Absolutely.
Marilynne Robinson,

00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:44.201
as is going to emerge in my
lecture today,

00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:47.449
is very much preoccupied with
the nineteenth century.

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:51.363
She is very interested,
especially, in these classic

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:56.045
American writers of the American
transcendentalist school--and

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:59.484
that's Melville,
Hawthorne, Emerson,

00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:03.695
Thoreau--also very interested
in Dickinson,

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:08.077
Emily Dickinson.
She has a sensibility that maps

00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:12.472
very closely with theirs,
and I'll get into that towards

00:03:12.472 --> 00:03:17.719
the end of my lecture today.
But, just as a narrative

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:24.295
strategy, how is "Call me
Ishmael" different from "My name

00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:27.229
is Ruth"?
Anyone have ideas about that?

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:32.340
What's different about those
two sentences?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.729
Yeah.Student:
Well, "Call me Ishmael"

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.577
sounds like it's more of a
choice on the character's part

00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:39.858
to identify themselves,
where Ruth is something that

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:41.318
was given to her,
and it wasn't something that

00:03:41.318 --> 00:03:42.649
she chose for
herself.Professor Amy

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:43.850
Hungerford: Okay.
Very good.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.819
Yeah.
So, Ishmael says,

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.494
"Here's what I want you to call
me," and Ruth says to us,

00:03:50.494 --> 00:03:53.500
"This is what people do call
me."

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.352
Yes.
Student:

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:56.949
One is interactive and one
is declarative?Professor

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:57.840
Amy Hungerford:
Absolutely.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.038
Yes.
So the "Call me" implies a

00:04:02.038 --> 00:04:04.757
"you."
It reaches out of the text and

00:04:04.757 --> 00:04:08.060
uses that implied second person
"you", "Call me Ishmael."

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.060
"My name is Ruth," simple
declarative sentence.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.246
It gives you that sense that
Ruth is more separate from you,

00:04:18.246 --> 00:04:22.439
perhaps, as a reader,
than Ishmael is.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.928
Ishmael wants to enter into
dialog with you,

00:04:25.928 --> 00:04:28.930
wants you to reach out towards
him.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.488
Ruth offers you herself as
something like the objective

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:39.120
contemplation of a stranger,
as a stranger.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.260
That's what a stranger says to
you: "Hi.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.418
My name is Amy."
That's the kind of address a

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.754
stranger gives you.
What else do you notice about

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:52.637
those two sentences?
Any other differences you can

00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:57.529
think of, or similarities,
even, between the two?

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.560
What about those names,
Ruth and Ishmael?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.089
Yes.
Is your hand up?

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:04.780
Your hand is,
yes, dangerously floating.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.969
Yes, you.
Student:

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:07.913
Both biblical
names?Professor Amy

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:09.470
Hungerford: Yeah.
Absolutely.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.761
Both biblical names,
and they have certain

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:12.880
similarities,
too.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.409
Yes.
Student:

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.528
Well, both Ruth and Ishmael
were sort of strangers in the

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.510
cultures that they lived in.
Professor Amy

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.981
Hungerford: Absolutely.
Can you explain more about

00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:25.809
that?Student:
Well, Ishmael was the first

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.959
son of Abraham,
but he was not really brought

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:31.752
into the family,
and eventually he was left in

00:05:31.752 --> 00:05:34.055
the wilderness.
The story is that from him

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:36.151
sprang up the Arabic
tribe.Professor Amy

00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:39.339
Hungerford: That's right.
So he's Hagar's son.

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:46.639
He is the son of Abraham's--or
Sarah's--serving woman.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.905
So, Abraham is unable to
conceive a child with Sarah,

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:54.925
so he sleeps with Hagar and
Hagar bears him a son,

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:58.102
Ishmael.
So, he's from the family of

00:05:58.102 --> 00:06:01.350
Abraham, but he is outside that
family.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.870
Now what about Ruth?
Do you want to continue?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.483
Yeah.
Student:

00:06:05.483 --> 00:06:07.600
Ruth married into a Jewish
family.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.029
She herself was not from a
Jewish family.

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.424
She was from another genetic
tribe, but, when her husband

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:19.647
died and her father-in-law died,
instead of returning to her own

00:06:19.647 --> 00:06:21.359
people she stayed with her
mother-in-law.Professor

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:22.459
Amy Hungerford:
That's right.

00:06:22.459 --> 00:06:24.845
So she stays with her
mother-in-law,

00:06:24.845 --> 00:06:28.050
Naomi, and they go back to the
land of Judah,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.065
and there she becomes known as
a righteous woman,

00:06:33.065 --> 00:06:37.139
a humble, loving and righteous
woman.

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.585
She is a daughter to her
mother-in-law,

00:06:39.585 --> 00:06:42.211
Naomi.
She in fact stays with Naomi

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:45.906
because she loves her,
and there is this beautiful

00:06:45.906 --> 00:06:49.548
line,
when Naomi urges her to go back

00:06:49.548 --> 00:06:54.449
to her own mother and stay in
Moab, her own land.

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.273
She says to Naomi,
"Where you go,

00:06:57.273 --> 00:06:59.559
I will go."
It's probably a line you've

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.235
heard, and it goes on.
It's a very beautiful--I

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:06.358
actually meant to bring my Bible
with me but I seem to have

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:09.129
forgotten it--a very beautiful
line.

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:12.079
So, it highlights her
faithfulness.

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:18.621
It's faith to Naomi that brings
her into the realm of Judah

00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:25.726
under the protection of the God
of the Israelites and causes her

00:07:25.726 --> 00:07:31.389
to become married to Boaz,
who is of a noble family.

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:36.332
And Ruth, finally,
is the great-grandmother of

00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:39.454
King David.
So, she is an alien,

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:44.706
a stranger, who comes into the
Israelite fold and ends up being

00:07:44.706 --> 00:07:48.180
in the lineage of their greatest
king.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:53.029
And, in the New Testament,
of course, that also means that

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:57.963
she is of the House of Jesus,
because Jesus is of the House

00:07:57.963 --> 00:08:02.079
of David.
So, in Christian teaching,

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:08.791
the story of Ruth is about the
foreshadowing of the gentile

00:08:08.791 --> 00:08:13.189
inclusion of the Jewish
redemption.

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:17.718
So, the Jewish messiah is the
world's redeemer,

00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:21.952
and the presence of the alien,
the stranger,

00:08:21.952 --> 00:08:27.860
in his bloodline suggests that
expansion of the promise.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.589
So, Ruth is a very
important character.

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:36.112
She is identified both by her
status as a stranger and by her

00:08:36.112 --> 00:08:40.070
absolute centrality to a strong
identity,

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:46.998
either as Israelite or as
Christian, in these two versions

00:08:46.998 --> 00:08:53.144
of this story of lineage.
It is no accident that this is

00:08:53.144 --> 00:08:58.299
the name that Robinson has
chosen for this character.

00:08:58.299 --> 00:09:03.470
Lots of elements of that story
enter into Ruth's story.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:10.019
So Ruth, like her namesake,
cleaves to a woman relative,

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:15.212
and this is Sylvie.
She cleaves to and becomes

00:09:15.212 --> 00:09:20.184
faithful to Sylvie,
her aunt, in place of her own

00:09:20.184 --> 00:09:23.308
mother.
So, there is an exchange,

00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:27.986
as in the biblical story,
between the mother that she has

00:09:27.986 --> 00:09:32.330
lost, in this novel through the
mother's suicide.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:38.016
She is replaced with an aunt.
There is also that sense that

00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:42.259
she follows the aunt into a
wandering life.

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:45.583
So, in the biblical story,
the wandering has a very clear

00:09:45.583 --> 00:09:49.726
end.
It's a wandering back to the

00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:54.730
mother-in-law's land,
back to Judah.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:59.467
You will have to think about,
as you get to the end of this

00:09:59.467 --> 00:10:03.469
novel, whether there is an end
to the wandering in

00:10:03.469 --> 00:10:07.671
Housekeeping,
 or whether it is an

00:10:07.671 --> 00:10:12.241
unmitigated wandering.
Related to that question is

00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.675
another one about narrative,
and that is:

00:10:15.675 --> 00:10:18.679
where does this voice come
from?

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:21.750
What account of this voice are
we given?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:27.070
Who is speaking to us and from
what position in the world?

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.080
This is a question I will get
to.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.870
By the end of this lecture,
we will come to an

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:39.552
understanding of that question.
So, the biblical reference,

00:10:39.552 --> 00:10:45.679
as well as the Melvillian
reference, suggests wandering.

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:49.171
And it suggests a complex
picture of identity,

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:54.059
and I think that's what you get
in the novel that connects it to

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:57.240
the conventions of the Identity
Plot.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.854
So, there is one element,
which is the whole theme of

00:11:00.854 --> 00:11:03.844
Lucille and Ruth,
which I was talking about,

00:11:03.844 --> 00:11:07.769
coming from your comment.
That's the simple version.

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:12.107
There is a more complicated
version that I just want to show

00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:13.210
you on 96,97.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:30.370
This is when Lucille and Ruth
are playing hooky from school.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.169
They've made their summer very
long, starting at March.

00:11:33.169 --> 00:11:35.539
I don't recommend this,
by the way.

00:11:35.539 --> 00:11:40.021
And they are walking around by
the railroad tracks,

00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:44.950
and they come upon some hobos.
This is the top of 96: 

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.361
We in our plaid dresses
and Orlon sweaters and velveteen

00:11:49.361 --> 00:11:53.700
shoes and they in their suit
coats with the vestigial collars

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.678
turned up and the lapels closed
might have been marooned

00:11:57.678 --> 00:12:00.860
survivors of some lost pleasure
craft.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:05.243
We and they alone might have
escaped the destruction of some

00:12:05.243 --> 00:12:09.330
sleek train [That's an Ishmael
reference right there.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.061
Ishmael is the only person to
escape the Pequod to come back

00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:16.540
and tell the story,
so there's an element of that

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.135
Melville reference right here,
too.]

00:12:19.135 --> 00:12:22.620
some flying shuttle of business
or commerce.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:27.024
Lucille and I might have been
two of a numerous family off to

00:12:27.024 --> 00:12:31.503
visit a grandmother in Lapwai
and they might have been touring

00:12:31.503 --> 00:12:34.659
legislators or members of a
dance band.

00:12:34.659 --> 00:12:38.035
Then our being there on a
bitter morning in ruined and

00:12:38.035 --> 00:12:40.837
unsuitable clothes,
wordlessly looking at the

00:12:40.837 --> 00:12:43.639
water, would be entirely
understandable.

00:12:43.639 --> 00:12:48.112
As it was, I thought of telling
them that our grandfather still

00:12:48.112 --> 00:12:52.440
lay in a train that had slid to
the lake floor long before we

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.845
were born.
Perhaps we all awaited a

00:12:54.845 --> 00:12:57.702
resurrection.
Perhaps we expected a train to

00:12:57.702 --> 00:13:00.357
leap out of the water,
caboose foremost,

00:13:00.357 --> 00:13:04.442
as if in a movie run backward
and then to continue across the

00:13:04.442 --> 00:13:06.782
bridge.
The passengers would arrive

00:13:06.782 --> 00:13:09.769
sounder than they departed,
accustomed to the depth,

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:12.420
serene about their restoration
to the light,

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.934
disembarking at the station in
Fingerbone with a calm that

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.399
quieted the astonishment of
friends.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:22.378
Say that this resurrection was
general enough to include my

00:13:22.378 --> 00:13:24.779
grandmother and Helen,
my mother.

00:13:24.779 --> 00:13:28.856
Say that Helen lifted our hair
from our napes with her cold

00:13:28.856 --> 00:13:32.230
hands and gave us strawberries
from her purse.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:36.193
Say that my grandmother pecked
our brows with her whiskery lips

00:13:36.193 --> 00:13:39.710
and then all of them went down
the road to our house,

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:42.634
my grandfather,
youngish and high-pocketed,

00:13:42.634 --> 00:13:46.743
just outside their conversation
like a difficult memory or a

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:49.182
ghost.
Then Lucille and I could run

00:13:49.182 --> 00:13:51.921
off to the woods,
leaving them to talk of old

00:13:51.921 --> 00:13:55.282
times and make sandwiches for
lunch and show each other

00:13:55.282 --> 00:13:59.416
snapshots.
There's a lovely movement in

00:13:59.416 --> 00:14:03.947
that passage.
So, first she moves from a

00:14:03.947 --> 00:14:10.902
fantasy that would make the
hobos and Lucille and Ruth part

00:14:10.902 --> 00:14:16.653
of comprehensible wholes,
comprehensible social groups,

00:14:16.653 --> 00:14:21.607
going to identifiable places,
moving through spaces that made

00:14:21.607 --> 00:14:24.848
sense.
So, if they were legislators,

00:14:24.848 --> 00:14:29.501
members of a dance band,
or the girls were part of some

00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:32.282
large family,
if they were all on some

00:14:32.282 --> 00:14:34.328
pleasure craft,
it would explain the

00:14:34.328 --> 00:14:37.308
inappropriateness of their
clothes and how they were

00:14:37.308 --> 00:14:39.759
ruined,
if there had been a disaster.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:46.860
All these are ways of imagining
a stable and socially legible

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:53.486
identity for all the people in
the scene, hobos and girls

00:14:53.486 --> 00:14:57.492
alike.
Then it slips into this moment

00:14:57.492 --> 00:15:02.950
where the difference between
Ruth and Lucille and the hobos

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.023
is insisted upon when she says,
"As it was, I thought of

00:15:08.023 --> 00:15:12.159
telling them that our
grandfather still lay in a train

00:15:12.159 --> 00:15:16.919
that had slid to the lake floor
long before we were born."

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:20.521
By turning to the hobos,
and in her mind addressing

00:15:20.521 --> 00:15:24.700
them, she pushes them further
away from her and Lucille,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:28.620
and begins to craft a
distinction between them.

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.363
They, Ruth and Lucille,
are rooted in Fingerbone by the

00:15:33.363 --> 00:15:38.809
very weight of their family
lying at the bottom of the lake.

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:42.775
So, it gives them a rootedness
to the place that the hobos

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:45.546
can't claim.
The hobos' transience is

00:15:45.546 --> 00:15:48.990
highlighted by this imagined
address to them.

00:15:53.539 --> 00:15:58.790
When she further dreams of
the resurrection of the whole

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.240
train, all the family at the
bottom of the lake,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.429
it allows her to imagine
herself and Lucille in this

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:11.289
warm, coherent embrace in a more
fulsome way.

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:14.461
So, the family,
then, isn't just imagined to

00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:19.455
distinguish them from the hobos,
but to imagine a more fully

00:16:19.455 --> 00:16:24.243
alive presence to her,
a family that will restore her

00:16:24.243 --> 00:16:28.110
identity and her legibility to
herself,

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.410
not just to the hobos or the
town.

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:38.943
And I love this repeated
structure, verbal structure,

00:16:38.943 --> 00:16:42.683
"say": the proposition,
"Say that Helen lifted our

00:16:42.683 --> 00:16:47.102
hair," a very intimate gesture,
"Say that my grandmother pecked

00:16:47.102 --> 00:16:49.740
our brows with her whiskery
lips,"

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:55.431
so that it invites us in to the
sensual commerce of a family,

00:16:55.431 --> 00:17:00.080
and that's what she uses her
imagination to do.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.835
But then, how it ends,
you can't miss this:

00:17:04.835 --> 00:17:09.930
"Lucille and I could run off to
the woods."

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.823
The restoration of the family,
the resurrection,

00:17:12.823 --> 00:17:16.455
is precisely what then will
liberate them to do exactly what

00:17:16.455 --> 00:17:20.393
they're doing now,
running off to the woods,

00:17:20.393 --> 00:17:24.374
being truant.
So, in this beautifully crafted

00:17:24.374 --> 00:17:28.871
passage, where we see Ruth's
imagination moving from one

00:17:28.871 --> 00:17:33.094
fantasy to another,
you see how the act of trying

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:37.609
to restore her own legibility
through this narrative,

00:17:37.609 --> 00:17:41.205
through that repeated "say,"
the propositions,

00:17:41.205 --> 00:17:45.039
finally gets her back to where
she was before.

00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:50.141
So that the restoration of a
secure identity in a family is,

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:55.328
in fact, what then propels her
out, to imagine once again her

00:17:55.328 --> 00:17:59.564
separateness from it.
So, what Robinson gives us,

00:17:59.564 --> 00:18:03.044
I think, in this version,
not so much in the story of

00:18:03.044 --> 00:18:06.590
Lucille and Ruth and the
difference between the two of

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.482
them,
which parses the problem as

00:18:09.482 --> 00:18:14.255
being those who conform and can
be legible to the world and

00:18:14.255 --> 00:18:19.769
those who are not and have to be
separate from the social world.

00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:22.170
Lucille goes to the home
economics teacher.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:27.539
Ruth goes with Sylvie.
That's a very simple split.

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:31.163
This passage,
and the way Ruth's mind works,

00:18:31.163 --> 00:18:35.966
makes it much more complex,
so that it's the identity that

00:18:35.966 --> 00:18:41.593
allows for the final alienation.
The identity or the security in

00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:45.693
the family is what allows for
the finding of one's

00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:50.464
separateness in the woods.
So, there are two kinds of

00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:54.611
identity at issue,
the single and the communal,

00:18:54.611 --> 00:18:59.390
or you could say the
contemplative and the social.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.974
I think it's ultimately the
contemplative,

00:19:02.974 --> 00:19:07.433
or the singular person,
that interests Robinson even

00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:10.688
more.
But I will say that in the

00:19:10.688 --> 00:19:15.377
initial reception of this
novel--because the Identity Plot

00:19:15.377 --> 00:19:20.395
is so fixed in the pattern of
literary work in this period and

00:19:20.395 --> 00:19:25.332
also fixed in the concerns of
critics--early readings of this

00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:29.445
novel really were all about that
simpler version of

00:19:29.445 --> 00:19:33.936
identification.
People read this as a feminist

00:19:33.936 --> 00:19:38.886
novel that was really all about
women being liberated from a

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:42.997
confining domesticity and
finding their individual

00:19:42.997 --> 00:19:47.359
identity out there in the world
some other way,

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:52.108
so that housekeeping and
its rejection were the major

00:19:52.108 --> 00:19:56.140
terms of the criticism.
And, if you've ever seen the

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:00.107
film "Thelma and Louise," you
can sort of see the way it

00:20:00.107 --> 00:20:04.508
chimes with a lot of what was
being thought in popular culture

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:08.833
on these questions.
You can think of Helen sailing

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:13.759
off the cliff into the lake,
which was seen as empowering,

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:16.581
in her car.
It did not take long for

00:20:16.581 --> 00:20:19.575
readers of this novel to abandon
that, because of the

00:20:19.575 --> 00:20:23.259
predominance of the themes that
I'm going to talk about next,

00:20:23.259 --> 00:20:27.128
and that's the question of:
how can you be a coherent

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:30.529
person in this world?
What does that look like?

00:20:30.529 --> 00:20:35.849
Ruth is very troubled by this
quality.

00:20:35.849 --> 00:20:43.715
It comes though in tiny ways,
like on 78, with other

00:20:43.715 --> 00:20:47.509
characters.
Lucille, we are told,

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:50.406
is caught cheating,
by her teacher,

00:20:50.406 --> 00:20:51.600
on a test:

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.103
Lucille was much too
indifferent to school ever to be

00:20:59.103 --> 00:21:02.061
guilty of cheating,
and it was only an evil fate

00:21:02.061 --> 00:21:06.026
that had prompted her to write
Simon Bolivar and the girl in

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:09.655
front of her to write Simon
Bolivar when the answer was

00:21:09.655 --> 00:21:13.888
obviously General Santa Anna.
This was the only error either

00:21:13.888 --> 00:21:17.069
of them made and so their papers
were identical.

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:20.380
Lucille was astonished to find
that the teacher was so easily

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.551
convinced of her guilt,
so immovably persuaded of it,

00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:27.135
calling her up in front of the
class and demanding that she

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:29.359
account for the identical
papers.

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:33.013
Lucille writhed under this
violation of her

00:21:33.013 --> 00:21:36.714
anonymity.
What does it mean to call that

00:21:36.714 --> 00:21:39.490
instance a violation of her
anonymity?

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:43.310
Well, what's imagined here is
that two minds,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.347
by some mysterious process,
sort of melded with one another

00:21:48.347 --> 00:21:53.490
and produced the same answers,
the exact, identical exams.

00:21:57.029 --> 00:22:04.435
Lucille is so easy with the
idea of that kind of melding

00:22:04.435 --> 00:22:10.089
that she is stunned by being
called out,

00:22:10.089 --> 00:22:16.938
not as a violation of her
honor, but as a violation of her

00:22:16.938 --> 00:22:20.884
anonymity.
She wanted to be without name,

00:22:20.884 --> 00:22:23.280
essentially.
That's what being anonymous

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.809
means.
You're without a name.

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:27.869
You kind of blend in with the
crowd.

00:22:27.869 --> 00:22:30.911
That's exactly what she was
doing when her mind blended with

00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:33.952
that of the girl in front of her
and they produced identical

00:22:33.952 --> 00:22:36.190
papers.
It's a funny little logic.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.895
It's a tiny detail that you can
see, now, "rhyming" with other

00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:44.045
details in the novel.
If you think of the

00:22:44.045 --> 00:22:48.389
conversation between Lily and
Nona, the two maiden aunts that

00:22:48.389 --> 00:22:51.140
take care of the girls for a
while,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:56.363
that funny conversation on page
38, where, essentially,

00:22:56.363 --> 00:23:02.360
these are two women who have
totally melded into each other.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.458
They say the same things.
Their conversations are just

00:23:05.458 --> 00:23:09.187
the ritual assurance of a shared
thread of thought:

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:11.500
"Someone filled the teapot."

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.509
"Children are hard for anybody."
"The Hartwick has always kept

00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:22.430
them out."
"And I understand that."

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:23.750
"I don't blame them."
"No."

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:24.980
"No."
And it goes on.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:29.068
These are two people who,
like Lucille and the girl in

00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:32.010
front of her,
their minds have melded this

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:36.407
time by long habit,
by long living together,

00:23:36.407 --> 00:23:40.300
and by their love for each
other.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.210
It gets darker, though, on 105.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:53.440
It's hard, as it turns out,
to maintain your separateness,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:58.638
or to maintain a sense that you
really are an entity as a

00:23:58.638 --> 00:23:59.660
person.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:08.922
"Where's Lucille?"
[says Sylvie to Ruth,

00:24:08.922 --> 00:24:13.657
having woken up on a bench.]
"Home," [says Ruth.]

00:24:13.657 --> 00:24:17.210
"Well, that's fine," Sylvie
said.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.789
"I'm glad to have a chance to
talk to you.

00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:20.980
You're so quiet,
it's hard to know what you

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.764
think."
Sylvie had stood up,

00:24:22.764 --> 00:24:25.000
and we began to walk toward
home.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.080
"I suppose I don't know what I
think."

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.025
This confession embarrassed me.
It was a source of both terror

00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:36.025
and comfort to me then that I
often seemed

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:39.318
invisible--incompletely or
minimally existent,

00:24:39.318 --> 00:24:42.394
in fact.
It seemed to me that I made no

00:24:42.394 --> 00:24:45.651
impact on the world,
and that in exchange I was

00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:50.212
privileged to watch it unawares.
But my allusion to this feeling

00:24:50.212 --> 00:24:54.310
of ghostliness sounded peculiar,
and sweat started all over my

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:58.140
body, convicting me on the spot
of gross corporeality.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:01.309
"Well, maybe that will change,"
Sylvie said.

00:25:01.309 --> 00:25:03.710
We walked a while without
speaking.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:07.240
"Maybe it won't."
I dropped a step behind and

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.009
watched her face.
She always spoke to me in the

00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:12.140
voice of an adult dispensing
wisdom.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:15.144
I wanted to ask her if she knew
what she thought,

00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:18.836
and if so, what the experience
of that sort of knowledge was

00:25:18.836 --> 00:25:22.574
like,
and if not, whether she too

00:25:22.574 --> 00:25:27.630
felt ghostly as I imagined she
must.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:34.785
This is an instance where what
Ruth experiences might be said

00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:40.390
to be total identity,
a very stable identity.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:45.211
She cannot alienate herself
from herself to know what she is

00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:48.896
thinking.
So, if you think about that

00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:53.438
construction,
"I don't know what I think," it

00:25:53.438 --> 00:25:57.670
posits an "I" who could know the
self.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:03.428
That's two entities, not one.
So, if you don't know what you

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:07.946
think, maybe it's because there
isn't that objective distance

00:26:07.946 --> 00:26:12.449
between an "I" and a self.
You're not self-alienated in

00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:16.093
that way that,
remember, Ambrose always is in

00:26:16.093 --> 00:26:19.434
Lost in the Funhouse.
That's his curse,

00:26:19.434 --> 00:26:22.065
that he is alienated from
himself, and he can never

00:26:22.065 --> 00:26:25.291
integrate.
So, it's like he's Lily and

00:26:25.291 --> 00:26:29.716
Nona in one person,
two entities but somehow the

00:26:29.716 --> 00:26:32.982
same.
Ruth, on the other hand,

00:26:32.982 --> 00:26:38.113
is like an indivisible
substance, but because it's

00:26:38.113 --> 00:26:42.825
indivisible it seems,
the logic here imagines,

00:26:42.825 --> 00:26:47.871
it's ghostly.
Somehow, it's like an essence

00:26:47.871 --> 00:26:53.867
or something unsubstantive,
because it doesn't have that

00:26:53.867 --> 00:26:59.461
alienation built into it.
How can you exist in the

00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:03.909
company of other people,
if the structure for even

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:08.720
knowing oneself doesn't seem to
exist in the mind?

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:15.840
There are other manifestations
that have more to do with

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:22.054
nature, and you can find one of
these on 115,116,

00:27:22.054 --> 00:27:27.149
the bottom of 116- 15.
This is when Lucille and Ruth

00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:30.902
spend the night outside.
It's one of two very important

00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:34.220
moments when Ruth spends the
night outside.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:39.375
Here's one with Lucille,
and there'll be one right after

00:27:39.375 --> 00:27:43.500
the page where I asked you to
stop for today,

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.590
with Sylvie.
For a while she [Lucille]

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.567
sang "Mockingbird Hill," and
then she sat down beside me in

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:51.894
our ruined stronghold,
never still,

00:27:51.894 --> 00:27:57.119
never accepting that all our
human boundaries were overrun.

00:27:57.119 --> 00:28:00.509
Lucille would tell this story
differently.

00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:04.359
She would say I fell asleep,
but I did not.

00:28:04.359 --> 00:28:09.234
I simply let the darkness in
the sky become coextensive with

00:28:09.234 --> 00:28:13.200
the darkness in my skull and
bowels and bones.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.174
Everything that falls upon the
eye is apparition,

00:28:16.174 --> 00:28:19.210
a sheet dropped over the
world's true workings.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:22.719
The nerves and the brain are
tricked, and one is left with

00:28:22.719 --> 00:28:26.535
dreams that these specters loose
their hands from ours and walk

00:28:26.535 --> 00:28:28.937
away,
the curve of the back and the

00:28:28.937 --> 00:28:32.760
swing of the coat so familiar as
to imply that they should be

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.538
permanent fixtures of the world,
when in fact nothing is more

00:28:37.538 --> 00:28:40.753
perishable.
Say that my mother was as tall

00:28:40.753 --> 00:28:44.859
as a man, and that she sometimes
set me on her shoulders,

00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:48.364
so that I could splash my hands
in the cold leaves above our

00:28:48.364 --> 00:28:50.887
heads.
Say that my grandmother sang in

00:28:50.887 --> 00:28:54.719
her throat while she sat on her
bed and we laced up her big

00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.464
black shoes.
Such details are merely

00:28:57.464 --> 00:29:01.099
accidental.
Who could know but us?

00:29:01.099 --> 00:29:04.425
And since their thoughts were
bent upon other ghosts than

00:29:04.425 --> 00:29:06.920
ours, other darknesses than we
had seen,

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.597
why must we be left,
the survivors picking among

00:29:10.597 --> 00:29:13.569
flotsam, among the small,
unnoticed,

00:29:13.569 --> 00:29:17.451
unvalued clutter that was all
that remained when they

00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:20.960
vanished, that only catastrophe
made notable?

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.423
Darkness is the only solvent.
While it was dark,

00:29:25.423 --> 00:29:28.801
despite Lucille's pacing and
whistling, and despite what must

00:29:28.801 --> 00:29:32.009
have been dreams (since even
Sylvie came to haunt me),

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:35.463
it seemed to me that there need
not be relic,

00:29:35.463 --> 00:29:38.289
remnant, margin,
residue, memento,

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:43.065
bequest, memory,
thought, track or trace if only

00:29:43.065 --> 00:29:48.349
the darkness could be perfect
and permanent.

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:53.447
So, Ruth feels her boundaries
overrun when the content of her

00:29:53.447 --> 00:29:58.630
mind and the quality of the
world become indistinguishable,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.135
the darkness in the mind and
the body indistinguishable from

00:30:02.135 --> 00:30:06.361
the darkness outside her.
And this is a positive

00:30:06.361 --> 00:30:11.128
condition for her,
insofar as it seems to

00:30:11.128 --> 00:30:16.730
eliminate the need for things
like memories,

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.299
traces, remnants,
that list that we're given.

00:30:20.299 --> 00:30:24.541
And I'm going to talk much more
about the question of loss on

00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:26.845
Wednesday.
That's the theme for that

00:30:26.845 --> 00:30:29.815
lecture on this novel,
so I'm going to leave that as

00:30:29.815 --> 00:30:32.960
something for you to think
about: what is the status of

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.551
loss in the novel?
But for now what I want to note

00:30:37.551 --> 00:30:43.321
is how the overrun boundaries of
the self is imagined as

00:30:43.321 --> 00:30:47.046
redemptive.
So, the loss of identity,

00:30:47.046 --> 00:30:51.650
as against some other outside
thing--be it nature,

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.784
another person,
another piece of the community,

00:30:54.784 --> 00:30:58.463
another group--that is imagined
not as a problem but as

00:30:58.463 --> 00:31:00.440
something to be embraced.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.574
These observations about
Ruth's permeability,

00:31:07.574 --> 00:31:11.630
and the general permeability of
persons one to another,

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:14.869
brings us back to that question
that I asked a little while ago.

00:31:14.869 --> 00:31:19.750
Where does Ruth's voice come
from?

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:27.382
And here I want to note that
language is imagined to be all

00:31:27.382 --> 00:31:32.910
mixed up with the material of
the world.

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.220
And, if you look on page 85,
you can see one example of

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:35.520
this.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:48.841
(Oops.
Sorry.

00:31:48.841 --> 00:31:56.369
I think that's not the-- Sorry.
Yes, this is the one I want.)

00:31:56.369 --> 00:31:59.760
I remember Sylvie walking
through the house with a scarf

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:02.039
tied around her hair,
carrying a broom.

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:04.451
Yet this was the time that
leaves began to gather in the

00:32:04.451 --> 00:32:06.609
corners.
There were leaves that had been

00:32:06.609 --> 00:32:09.270
through the winter,
some of them worn to a net of

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.367
veins.
There were scraps of paper

00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:15.117
among them, crisp and strained
from their mingling in the cold

00:32:15.117 --> 00:32:17.759
brown liquors of decay and
regeneration,

00:32:17.759 --> 00:32:22.000
and on these scraps there were
sometimes words.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.601
One read Powers Meet,
and another,

00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:28.568
which had been the flap of an
envelope, had a penciled message

00:32:28.568 --> 00:32:31.690
in an anonymous hand:
I think of you.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:35.470
Perhaps Sylvie when she swept
took care not to molest them.

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.004
Perhaps she sensed a Delphic
niceness in the scattering of

00:32:40.004 --> 00:32:43.664
these leaves and paper,
here and not elsewhere,

00:32:43.664 --> 00:32:48.718
thus and not otherwise.
Words are all bound up in the

00:32:48.718 --> 00:32:52.988
material of the world,
the stuff that gathers in the

00:32:52.988 --> 00:32:55.940
corners of a house.
And, moreover,

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.621
they are words that are very
evocative, "Powers Meet," as if

00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:05.302
somehow language and leaves
meeting in the corner of a house

00:33:05.302 --> 00:33:09.903
signifies the various powers of
the cosmos coming together:

00:33:09.903 --> 00:33:14.341
"Powers Meet."
"I think of you" and its

00:33:14.341 --> 00:33:21.039
anonymity, its character as
coming from an envelope flap,

00:33:21.039 --> 00:33:23.602
the kind of piece of paper that
travels from one person to

00:33:23.602 --> 00:33:25.400
another, suggests a
communicativeness,

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:32.197
a general intent surrounding
these pieces of matter,

00:33:32.197 --> 00:33:37.121
leaves and paper.
So, two things associated

00:33:37.121 --> 00:33:40.007
with language,
the words themselves,

00:33:40.007 --> 00:33:44.130
and also intention,
gather around these debris.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:48.865
If that is true,
we might also think of 126,

00:33:48.865 --> 00:33:53.380
the dictionary full of pressed
flowers.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.305
This is another beautiful image.
So, Lucille has asked Ruth to

00:33:57.305 --> 00:34:01.402
look up "pinking shears" in the
dictionary, because she's trying

00:34:01.402 --> 00:34:04.913
to make her dress and she
doesn't know what the pinking

00:34:04.913 --> 00:34:08.230
shears are that are called for
in the pattern.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.489
And so she asks Ruth to look it
up.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:16.176
Ruth finds, pressed in to old
dictionary, flowers that her

00:34:16.176 --> 00:34:20.765
grandfather has gathered,
all filed under their

00:34:20.765 --> 00:34:25.064
alphabetical name.
And, she is much more concerned

00:34:25.064 --> 00:34:29.002
with the flowers than she is
with getting the definition of

00:34:29.002 --> 00:34:32.210
"pinking shears."
So, here you have two visions

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.400
of language: one--the "pinking
shears," language,

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.123
the horde of words--is for
identifying things so you can do

00:34:40.123 --> 00:34:43.220
practical tasks.
And, in this case,

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.475
the practical task is Lucille's
effort to blend in with the

00:34:48.475 --> 00:34:52.984
town.
Ruth's conception of language

00:34:52.984 --> 00:34:59.639
is that it is a horde of
expressive gems or (Well,

00:34:59.639 --> 00:35:04.876
that's not a good way of
putting it) it's a vocabulary of

00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:10.300
the world that includes not only
words but also flowers.

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:16.147
And that there are beauties of
each, all in their place,

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:20.769
in this dictionary.
So, if language comes,

00:35:20.769 --> 00:35:23.527
almost viscerally,
from nature,

00:35:23.527 --> 00:35:28.857
here we can see exactly how
Robinson is in the realm of the

00:35:28.857 --> 00:35:32.809
nineteenth-century
Transcendentalists,

00:35:32.809 --> 00:35:36.860
and here I'm going to read you
a little bit from Emerson's

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:42.063
essay Nature.
This is what he says about

00:35:42.063 --> 00:35:46.938
being in the woods.
Within these plantations

00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:51.381
of God a decorum and sanctity
reign, a perennial festival is

00:35:51.381 --> 00:35:54.704
dressed,
and the guest sees not how he

00:35:54.704 --> 00:35:58.230
should tire of them in a
thousand years.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.849
In the woods we return to
reason and faith.

00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:05.688
There I feel that nothing can
befall me in life,

00:36:05.688 --> 00:36:09.118
no disgrace,
no calamity leaving me my eyes

00:36:09.118 --> 00:36:13.641
which nature cannot repair.
Standing on the bare ground,

00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:17.839
my head bathed by the blithe
air, and uplifted into infinite

00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:20.400
space, all mean egotism
vanishes.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.280
I become a transparent eyeball.
I am nothing.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.538
I see all.
The currents of the universal

00:36:27.538 --> 00:36:32.420
being circulate through me.
I am part or parcel of God.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.921
The name of the nearest friend
sounds then foreign and

00:36:35.921 --> 00:36:37.846
accidental.
To be brothers,

00:36:37.846 --> 00:36:40.548
to be acquaintances,
master or servant,

00:36:40.548 --> 00:36:43.250
is then a trifle and a
disturbance.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:46.420
I am the lover of uncontained
and immortal beauty.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.808
In the wilderness I find
something more dear and connate

00:36:49.808 --> 00:36:53.259
than in streets or villages in
the tranquil landscape and

00:36:53.259 --> 00:36:56.340
especially in the distant line
of the horizon.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.714
Man beholds somewhat as
beautiful as his own

00:37:00.714 --> 00:37:03.933
nature.
So, the transparent eyeball,

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:07.279
"I am nothing.
I see all," that is the sense

00:37:07.279 --> 00:37:11.737
you get of Ruth's voice,
that Ruth's voice is like the

00:37:11.737 --> 00:37:14.849
voice of that transparent
eyeball.

00:37:14.849 --> 00:37:19.295
The difference between
Emerson's vision and Robinson's,

00:37:19.295 --> 00:37:23.822
I think, is the way Robinson is
willing to let the human

00:37:23.822 --> 00:37:27.444
environment,
the built environment,

00:37:27.444 --> 00:37:33.520
the house, become part and
parcel of that woodsy whole that

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:37.920
Emerson so wants to immerse
himself in.

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:41.260
So, the house is opened to
leaves;

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.019
leaves are mixed up with pieces
of paper with words.

00:37:45.019 --> 00:37:50.794
And so, you get that sense of a
creation that is saying

00:37:50.794 --> 00:37:56.575
something to this consciousness,
in the same way that Emerson

00:37:56.575 --> 00:37:59.639
imagines, but it can happen in a
house.

00:37:59.639 --> 00:38:06.610
She embellishes this vision of
a speaking, material world.

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:16.227
So, Ruth's sense of self
mirrors that fluidity that you

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:25.510
get in the transparent eyeball.
There is also something that

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.074
you can see.
(Wait.

00:38:28.074 --> 00:38:33.239
Hold on.
I'm now trying to find the page

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:39.199
number that I need.
This is 16 through 19.

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:43.668
Here it is.) That fluidity of
consciousness that the

00:38:43.668 --> 00:38:49.101
transparent eyeball gives you is
beautifully on display in this

00:38:49.101 --> 00:38:53.219
passage towards the beginning of
the novel,

00:38:53.219 --> 00:38:57.510
when Ruth is thinking about how
her grandmother responded to the

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:01.460
death of her husband and the
departure of her daughters.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:03.954
I'm not going to read this
whole thing because it would

00:39:03.954 --> 00:39:06.172
simply take too long,
but I just want to show you

00:39:06.172 --> 00:39:08.019
what happens over these three
pages.

00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:12.422
So, on the top of 16,
this is another one of those

00:39:12.422 --> 00:39:15.530
hypotheticals:
One day my grandmother

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.972
must have carried out a basket
of sheets to hang in the spring

00:39:18.972 --> 00:39:21.531
sunlight,
wearing her widow's black,

00:39:21.531 --> 00:39:25.800
performing the rituals of the
ordinary as an act of faith.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.125
Say there were two or three
inches of hard old snow on the

00:39:29.125 --> 00:39:32.508
ground, with earth here and
there oozing through the broken

00:39:32.508 --> 00:39:34.741
places,
and that there was warmth in

00:39:34.741 --> 00:39:37.128
the sunlight,
when the wind did not blow it

00:39:37.128 --> 00:39:38.878
all away.
And say she stooped

00:39:38.878 --> 00:39:42.140
breathlessly in her corset to
lift up a sodden sheet by its

00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.094
hems,
and say that when she had

00:39:44.094 --> 00:39:47.405
pinned three corners to the
lines it began to billow and

00:39:47.405 --> 00:39:50.023
leap in her hands,
to flutter and tremble,

00:39:50.023 --> 00:39:53.202
and to glare with the light,
and that the throes of the

00:39:53.202 --> 00:39:56.851
thing were as gleeful and strong
as if a spirit were dancing in

00:39:56.851 --> 00:39:58.739
its cerements.
That wind!

00:39:58.739 --> 00:40:01.493
she would say,
because it pushed the skirts of

00:40:01.493 --> 00:40:04.980
her coat against her legs and
made the strands of her hair

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:06.779
fly.
It came down the lake,

00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:10.349
and it smelled sweetly of snow,
and rankly of melting snow,

00:40:10.349 --> 00:40:13.611
and it called to mind the
small, scarce stemmy flowers

00:40:13.611 --> 00:40:17.179
that she and Edmund would walk
half a day to pick.

00:40:17.179 --> 00:40:21.156
Did you catch that little
transition there,

00:40:21.156 --> 00:40:26.269
transition from proposition,
"Say that this happens,

00:40:26.269 --> 00:40:30.877
say this is what my grandmother
did and saw and smelled," to a

00:40:30.877 --> 00:40:34.050
seamless inhabitation through
that free,

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:37.844
indirect discourse.
Ruth enters the mind of her

00:40:37.844 --> 00:40:42.782
grandmother and starts to
inhabit her memories of her

00:40:42.782 --> 00:40:48.099
husband from long before the
time when Ruth was born.

00:40:48.099 --> 00:40:51.444
We smell the wind,
with Ruth, through the

00:40:51.444 --> 00:40:56.711
grandmother, and we know that it
reminds her of the flowers that

00:40:56.711 --> 00:41:00.982
she and Edmund would pick.
And then, you get a long

00:41:00.982 --> 00:41:05.314
meditation of the most private
thoughts that the grandmother

00:41:05.314 --> 00:41:08.765
has about her husband,
and what he's like in the

00:41:08.765 --> 00:41:11.834
springtime.
And this is at the bottom of

00:41:11.834 --> 00:41:16.030
17, and it concludes with this
line: "At such timesâ€¦."

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:21.708
She's just imagined him as a
primitive man rather than formal

00:41:21.708 --> 00:41:24.558
Edmund.
At such times he was as

00:41:24.558 --> 00:41:28.073
forgetful of her as he was of
his suspenders and his

00:41:28.073 --> 00:41:30.772
Methodism,
but all the same it was then

00:41:30.772 --> 00:41:34.250
that she loved him best,
as a soul all unaccompanied,

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.541
like her own.
It's that "soul all

00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:44.090
unaccompanied" that most
concerns Robinson as a writer.

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:50.508
And here Ruth imagines a kind
of free access to that other

00:41:50.508 --> 00:41:56.722
soul that is her grandmother.
And, if you look in the middle

00:41:56.722 --> 00:42:01.349
of 18, there is one of these
amazing tense shifts.

00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:07.809
Ruth is going from meditating
on her early widowhood as a

00:42:07.809 --> 00:42:12.769
memory, to a time a little less
far back,

00:42:12.769 --> 00:42:16.529
to the wake of her daughters'
departures, the grandmother's

00:42:16.529 --> 00:42:20.328
grief at their departure.
And now [That's the "now"

00:42:20.328 --> 00:42:22.442
referred to in the middle of
18.]

00:42:22.442 --> 00:42:26.473
And now to comfort herself my
grandmother would not reflect on

00:42:26.473 --> 00:42:30.570
the unkindness of her children
or of children in general.

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:33.661
She had noticed many times
always that her girls' faces

00:42:33.661 --> 00:42:37.097
were soft and serious and inward
and still when she looked at

00:42:37.097 --> 00:42:40.590
them just as they had been when
they were small children,

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.650
just as they were now when they
were sleeping.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.761
If a friend was in the room,
her daughters would watch his

00:42:46.761 --> 00:42:50.092
or her face intently and tease
or soothe or banter and any one

00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:53.095
of them could gauge and respond
to the finest changes of

00:42:53.095 --> 00:42:56.074
expression or tone,
even Sylvie if she chose to,

00:42:56.074 --> 00:42:59.648
but it did not occur to them to
suit their words and manners to

00:42:59.648 --> 00:43:02.070
her looks and she did not want
them to.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:06.160
In fact, she was often prompted
or restrained by the thought of

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.800
saving this unconsciousness of
theirs.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.789
She was then a magisterial
woman not only because of her

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:15.042
height and her large,
sharp face, not only because of

00:43:15.042 --> 00:43:17.948
her upbringing,
but also because it suited her

00:43:17.948 --> 00:43:21.888
purpose to be what she seemed to
be so that her children would

00:43:21.888 --> 00:43:25.827
never be startled or surprised
and to take on all the postures

00:43:25.827 --> 00:43:29.250
and vestments of matron to
differentiate her life from

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.609
theirs so that her children
would never feel intruded

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:36.130
upon.
She's careful to guard their

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:38.545
separateness.
And then, you get this

00:43:38.545 --> 00:43:42.209
wonderful meditation--quite
mysterious, and I don't actually

00:43:42.209 --> 00:43:45.748
have a full account of it--why
the grandmother finding the

00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:49.659
potatoes in the garden comes to
be a moment of revelation.

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:51.590
Maybe this is something you can
think about.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.609
Why is it specifically that
detail that Robinson chooses to

00:43:56.609 --> 00:44:01.370
make a moment of epiphany when
the grandmother says:

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.929
"What have I seen?
What have I seen?

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:07.657
The earth and the sky and the
garden not as they always are,"

00:44:07.657 --> 00:44:11.446
and she saw her daughters' faces
not as they always were or as

00:44:11.446 --> 00:44:15.359
other people's were and she was
quiet and aloof and watchful not

00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:20.088
to startle the strangeness away.
She had never taught them to be

00:44:20.088 --> 00:44:24.459
kind to her.
So, in that three-page passage,

00:44:24.459 --> 00:44:29.450
Ruth's voice inhabits her
grandmother's mind at widely

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:33.217
varied moments in the
grandmother's life:

00:44:33.217 --> 00:44:36.443
important,
extremely intimate moments,

00:44:36.443 --> 00:44:39.869
even the strange moment of
epiphany in the garden.

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:41.699
No one is anywhere near or
around.

00:44:41.699 --> 00:44:44.300
It's a very mysterious kind of
epiphany.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.300
Who knows, really,
what it means?

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.929
And yet Ruth can tell us about
it.

00:44:50.929 --> 00:44:56.049
Robinson has described her
writerly project as giving us

00:44:56.049 --> 00:45:01.082
access to the kinds of things
that people would say if they

00:45:01.082 --> 00:45:03.887
could,
and I just want to read you

00:45:03.887 --> 00:45:07.976
this quotation from Robinson:
"One of the primary mistakes

00:45:07.976 --> 00:45:12.497
people make is to take people's
spoken language to be equivalent

00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:18.072
to the level of their thinking.
I think it's one of the oddest

00:45:18.072 --> 00:45:21.726
errors."
What she takes herself to be

00:45:21.726 --> 00:45:27.535
doing is to be providing for
Ruth's mind a language that can

00:45:27.535 --> 00:45:33.639
match the flexibility of this
young person's consciousness,

00:45:33.639 --> 00:45:42.174
its range, its permeability,
and also in that very supple

00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:49.989
voice to be her identity,
so the voice becomes who Ruth

00:45:49.989 --> 00:45:52.514
is.
So, no matter how far she

00:45:52.514 --> 00:45:57.591
ranges across her boundaries of
person, no matter how indistinct

00:45:57.591 --> 00:46:02.910
the darkness in her mind is from
the darkness outside her body,

00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:08.674
that voice can still be heard.
And it can still be identified

00:46:08.674 --> 00:46:12.900
as hers, even as it ranges in
and out of her grandmother's

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.178
thoughts,
in and out of Sylvie's

00:46:15.178 --> 00:46:17.828
thoughts, in and out of
Lucille's thoughts,

00:46:17.828 --> 00:46:20.289
in and out of her mother's
thoughts.

00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:24.830
So that, in the end,
is what constitutes something

00:46:24.830 --> 00:46:29.229
like identity in this novel.
Now, on Wednesday,

00:46:29.229 --> 00:46:33.645
in the very short time I will
have, I'll talk about what that

00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:37.547
voice has to do with the
question of loss which haunts

00:46:37.547 --> 00:46:41.891
this novel in every sentence,
as I'm sure you've noticed,

00:46:41.891 --> 00:46:44.210
very elegiac sense to this
novel.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.783
So, I'm going to reconcile this
argument that I've made today

00:46:47.783 --> 00:46:51.000
with an analysis of what that is
doing in the novel.

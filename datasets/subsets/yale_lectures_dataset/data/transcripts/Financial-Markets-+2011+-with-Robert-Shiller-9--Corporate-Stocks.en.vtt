00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.580
We're talking about corporate
stocks this time.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.140
We've talked already about
them a little bit.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.690
We talked about how people would
set up a corporation and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.890
then divide it up into shares.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:21.210
And then, the company grows,
more shares are issued, and

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.010
some people sell their shares.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.010
It's a way of creating an
organization that works.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.670
We talked about the first real
corporation with traded

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.450
shares, that was the Dutch East
India Company in 1602.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.360
It was an idea that took hold
and became a scheme for

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.410
organization of business and has
become extremely important

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.650
around the world.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.880
I actually had my own
personal experience.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.345
I've created two corporations
in my life.

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:04.020
The first time, it was one of
my students here at Yale,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.760
Allan Weiss.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.480
Actually, he was not
an undergraduate.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:13.260
He was getting an MBA from
the School of Management.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.680
But he came to me after he
graduated and said, I see that

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.900
you create home price indexes.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.370
I'd like to start a company
and sell them.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.770
And so, he wanted me to
advise the company.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.260
And then we decided to make
it a corporation.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.880
We brought in my colleague, Chip
Case, who's at Wellesley

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.990
College, and it's called Case
Shiller Weiss Incorporated.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.760
We brought in a fourth, a real
businessman, but he said it

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.380
would be ridiculous to have four
names on the company, so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.120
he generously allowed
his name.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.340
It's Chuck Longfield.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.680
But then we set up the company,
and I remember

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.645
saying, I'm not going
to be that involved.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:01:59.890
I'll be somewhat involved, but
I'm going to keep teaching at

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.260
Yale and I can't do more than
a day a week at most

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.210
or less than that.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.365
So, we had to decide how
many shares we got.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.860
The only guy who gave it money
was the businessman.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.520
That's how you do it.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.880
He put money into the company.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.050
The rest of us just agreed
to put in time.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.540
So, the question is, how do
we divide up the company?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.500
Who gets how many shares?

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.850
The businessman put in money.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.330
I'm putting in time.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.970
How do we do that?

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.330
And I know I'm not going to put
in as much time as Allan

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.990
Weiss, who is actually
running the company.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.780
But you know what we did?

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.440
We just divided it four
ways and we set it up.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.880
And it's not a big company,
but I'm saying it, because

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.870
it's my own personal experience
having done this.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.040
That was 1991.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.040
We sold it in 2002 to Fiserv,
Inc. And at that time we had

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.785
12 employees.

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:03.760
It never got that big.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.140
But then later on, S&amp;P
bought the index.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.320
The home price index is called
the S&amp;P/ Case-Shiller Indices,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.905
which are now quoted a lot.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.365
I thought, it was a success.

00:03:15.365 --> 00:03:19.310
It didn't get really big,
but it was a success.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.010
One thing that I learned from
this experience is, have

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.110
appreciation for lawyers.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.230
Because I had never funded a
company before and I didn't

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.070
know what kind of things
would happen.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.440
Incidentally, in dividing up
the company, I think it was

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.560
just fairness.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.000
We thought, we'll
all make our own

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.480
contribution in our own way.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.770
We can't decide who's
more important.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:42.960
But you know, honestly,
I didn't really

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.780
care about the money.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.180
For me, it was just
a new experience.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.910
It was like, we could all
be in this together.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.200
We're all trying to make money
and making something big.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.160
It was just a kind of a story
for me, that made it a little

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.020
bit of an adventure.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.390
I was in it for the fun of it,
because I really don't feel

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.230
like I need any money.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.230
I have a job.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.530
I don't aspire to a mansion
or anything like that.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.260
But we just did it.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.329
It was fun.

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.230
The reason why I appreciated
lawyers is that they seemed to

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.340
anticipate all of our conflict
and they wrote things.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.850
We had a corporate charter, a
long document, but it actually

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.780
made sense, because we did
get into some conflicts.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.350
This is what happens
in a company.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.500
Somebody isn't working as hard
as somebody else, and then

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.890
some resentment develops.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.140
So, what do you do?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.880
The salve is more shares.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.530
If one guy's doing more than
another, it gets brought up at

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.890
the board meeting, and someone
says, well let's give this guy

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.330
more shares.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.010
It's called a bonus, right?

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.520
So, we discovered the wisdom
of this system.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.850
And I think a lot of people
around the world have

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.090
discovered it, and that's why
corporations are such an

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.620
important component
of our economy.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.980
So, that's just my own personal
story, but I wanted

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.840
to talk about big and important

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.970
corporations, not mine.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.490
But first, I wanted to give you
some sense of perspective

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.450
on how important corporations
are.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:30.030
Corporate stock as traded
on stock markets.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.370
So, I have data here from
the World Bank.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.590
And that's the website.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.660
You can get all the countries
of the world

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.440
from it if you want.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.050
And the latest data
they have is 2008.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.950
And for various countries or
various regions of the world

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.680
they have the value of the stock
market, of the listed

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.625
stocks in those countries in
trillions of U.S. dollars.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.670
That's this column, the
trillions of dollars.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.180
They also have the fraction of
GDP represented by the stock

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.230
markets in that country.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.060
So, you can see that the biggest
stock market in the

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.250
world is the United States.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.730
So, it's $11.7 trillion
in 2008 according

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.810
to the World Bank.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.030
Second biggest is the euro-area,
$5 trillion.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.650
And U.K. is very big, because
the United Kingdom was very

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.630
early to become a financial
center.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.150
And it's an enormous financial
center now.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.010
The interesting thing though
is as a fraction of GDP.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.560
People are confused when we talk
about fraction of GDP,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.770
because it's one year's GDP
we're talking about.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.700
We're comparing a stock
with the flow.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.950
A stock of wealth in the stock
market, dividing that by one

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.680
year's GDP.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.010
So, it shows here that the
United States' stock market in

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.070
2008 was worth almost a year's
GDP and it was higher than any

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.080
other major country.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.170
Again, this is a symbol
of capitalism.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.360
If you want to invest in stocks
anywhere you live in

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.790
the world, you're going to
probably come to the United

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.970
States, because it's
much higher.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.350
I mean, you could do Asia.

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:38.760
Asia and the Pacific, $3
trillion, but the U.S. is

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.050
almost four times as large.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.560
That's because of the
long history.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.135
This is a capitalist country.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.730
And as I was saying, the New
York corporate law of 1811 got

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:57.420
this ball rolling, and so it
has led the world on that.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.030
But I think if we look at this
chart again in ten 10 or 20

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.220
years, it's going to look
different, because stock

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.560
markets are growing around
the world, as a form of

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.040
organization for enterprise.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.050
So, these numbers on the rest of
the world are all going up,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:24.520
and we'll see more and
more value elsewhere.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.730
And the reason is,
because it works.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.549
The system coordinates
the activity.

00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:31.890
It allows people to
work together.

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:38.169
And it allows them to avoid
conflicts and motivate people

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.880
to work and get things done.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.990
And it creates wealth,
and people like that.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:48.560
And so, it seems like something
that was learned.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.150
We had a big grand experiment
with socialism obviously in

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.850
many places of the world, and
the socialists gave up on it.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.770
They decided, this
works better.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.366
That's why we have in China
now market socialism.

00:09:02.366 --> 00:09:04.650
It's still socialism
in a sense.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.615
It's transformed and it's
different, but it does have a

00:09:08.615 --> 00:09:13.730
stock market and it's growing
rapidly there.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.930
But I don't want to exaggerate
the importance of these,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.940
either, because the total value
here for the United

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:24.240
States is only 82% of
one year's GDP.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.040
Another way of putting
it is this.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.820
Let's round that to $12
trillion, and there were about

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:36.240
300 million Americans in 2008.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.470
That's $40,000 per capita
as the total value

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:40.910
of the stock market.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.540
Now does that sound like
a lot of money to you?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.030
Well, think of it this way.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.760
For a family of four,
that's $160,000.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:55.830
That won't buy you a house,
so it's not that big.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.160
It's big, but it's
not that big.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.900
What you have to remember is
that corporate stocks are

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:05.870
claims on the profits of
corporations, but most of what

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.160
corporations do is, take money
in and pay it out.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.990
They pay it out to their
employees and to other people,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.540
bondholders and taxes,
lots of other places

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.730
that money goes to.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.120
So, the actual value of the
stock market, I think most

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.270
people exaggerate it
in their mind.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.710
It's not that big.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:27.290
It's big, but not that big.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.030
It's smaller in other
countries.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.430
You might wonder, why
is it that in Europe

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:37.680
it's only 38% of GDP?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.290
That sounds funny, right?

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:48.570
In Europe, they're moving I
think in the direction of more

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:53.830
modern corporations with big
exchange traded corporations,

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:59.750
but they often do things on
a smaller scale still.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.860
So, for example in Germany.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.250
You notice that often companies
in Germany, after

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.790
the end of their name
they have AG.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.070
That stands for
Aktiengesellschaft, and that

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.270
means stock market company.

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.300
But others have GmbH.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.460
Do I have that capitalized
right?

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:25.880
Gesellschaft mit beschraenkter
Haftung.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.470
That means a family company.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.480
It's a company that's not traded
on the stock exchange.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.690
What we're looking at here
are traded stocks.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.430
Actually, my company that I was
just telling you about was

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.830
never traded.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.830
That's called private equity.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.880
If it's on the stock exchange,
it's public equity.

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:56.350
And if it's not traded,
it's private.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.080
So, this is private,
and this is public.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.270
And there are similar
distinctions in other

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:06.360
countries, but this
is Germany.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.940
I just wanted to be clear
about one thing.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:16.270
The word equity has many
different meanings, but the

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:22.500
meaning that we have here is
shares in a corporation.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.200
I was curious about how far
back that term goes.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.270
That word equity, referring to
shares, was not coined until I

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.800
think it was 1904 according to
the Oxford English Dictionary.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.030
And it was American.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.120
That's an American term that's
now spread over the world.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.690
But we use equity.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.880
I was trying to think, why
do we call it equity?

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.400
I think equity means equality
and fairness, and so, what it

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.970
means is, each share is equal.

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:55.910
I think that's what it means.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:58.175
We're treating people
with equality.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.250
So, that's what we have. We have
an equitable division of

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:11.070
profits among owners
of a corporation.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:15.130
By the way, I was making
a comparison.

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.520
I said the value of shares in
the United States is $40,000

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.460
per capita, and it must be
much less in Europe, like

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.180
$20,000 or less of
traded stocks.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:30.630
I just want to compare
that with houses.

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.440
I said $160,000 would be the
share of a family of four in

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.330
that value of the U.S.
stock market.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.800
Actually, it is quite clear that
the value of houses in

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.160
the United States is greater
than the value

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.700
of the stock market.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:52.430
According to the Federal
Reserve, the total value of

00:13:52.430 --> 00:14:02.850
houses in the United States
in 2010 was $18 trillion.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:07.640
That's quite a bit higher than
the value of the stock market.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.550
Incidentally, the Federal
Reserve estimates the total

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:15.760
assets of households in the
United States, and in 2010

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:18.390
that was $69 trillion.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.880
So, people own a lot of other
things besides stocks.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.810
So, I'm minimizing the
importance of the topic of my

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:28.840
lecture, because stocks
aren't that valuable.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.970
We couldn't solve the poverty
problem by redistributing the

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.420
stocks among all the people.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.950
Suppose we did that,
all right?

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.380
Supposed we said, let's grab
all of the stocks away from

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.850
the wealthy people and let's
just share them equally among

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:43.660
the whole people.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:48.530
So, some poor family would get
$160,000 one time only, right?

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:49.610
Remember, one time only.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.890
It's a stock, it's not
a per year amount.

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:55.810
So, would that lift them
out of poverty?

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.750
Not if you have to live the rest
of your life on $160,000.

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.660
You'd still be in poverty.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.080
So, the solution to poverty is
not redistributing stocks.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.860
I think the solution to poverty
is instead making

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:13.450
these markets work better,
so that we produce more.

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.110
OK.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:18.810
So, I'm going to talk about
stocks and the different kinds

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:25.520
of stocks and the laws of the
stock market here today.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.900
And then, I'm going to come at
the end with a couple of

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.830
examples of companies.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:38.100
I have an example of Xerox and
Microsoft, both high-flying

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.430
companies in their days.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:52.330
Another term that I just want
to use is corporation.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.520
Corporation comes from the Latin
corpus, meaning body.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.740
The idea of a corporation
is like a legal person.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.690
The lawyers say natural
person.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:14.010
Each one of you is a natural
person, but there are

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.260
artificial persons as well, and
the corporation is called

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:23.670
an artificial person, even
though it really

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.040
only is owned by people.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:32.120
It's like a slave belonging
to the shareholders.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.100
So, that's the origin
of the term.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.170
Actually, corporations go back
to ancient Rome where they

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:47.020
were called publicani, and they
had a stock market in the

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:53.420
Roman forum, but they were never
allowed to proliferate.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.840
The laws encouraging them
did not create a

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.440
swell of new companies.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.050
They were very few of them.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.020
It wasn't until the 19th century
that corporations

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.584
really became important.

00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:17.490
Now, a corporation is owned by
the shareholders, and in most

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:21.230
corporations all the
shareholders are equal.

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.140
That's why we call it equity.

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.850
And they all have one vote.

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.860
It's one share, one vote.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.570
Not always.

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:29.680
There have been exceptions.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:35.020
There are non-voting shares,
but usually they all vote.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.540
And the idea is that the
shareholders vote to elect a

00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.280
board of directors.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.540
This is what they call
shareholder democracy.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.680
It's inspired by political
democracy.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.000
They were going to set up a
company that's democratic, but

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.910
it's not democratic in
that every person

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:54.260
has a right to vote.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.030
It's each share has
a right to vote.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.060
And so, that's the
essential idea.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.910
When you form a company in the
United States, you have to

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:12.620
choose a state to
incorporate in.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:15.940
And then, each state has
its own corporate laws.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.240
So, my company, we did
it in Massachusetts.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.880
A lot of people like to do it in
Delaware, because they like

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.800
those laws of Delaware and
the taxes of that state.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.960
So, you choose, and then the
state will dictate some basic

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.670
rules, typically that you have
to have an annual shareholders

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.990
meeting where you vote.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:40.450
That's the idea.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:41.965
And you know, we did that.

00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:43.100
I remember.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.520
We followed the law.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.150
Someone had a plan,
and it worked.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.750
And so, what do you do at the
shareholders meeting?

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:57.050
Well, according to the bylaws in
the company, certain things

00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:59.250
have to be decided there,
but not many.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.090
The basic thing you
do is you hire a

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.050
chief executive officer.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.180
You agree to hire that person.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.700
And then this chief executive
officer reports to the board

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.280
as an employee of the company.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.070
And in the U.S., the chief
executive officer has by

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.150
tradition often been named the
chairman of the board, but in

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.540
Europe, that's less likely.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:31.800
There are some different
traditions in

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.630
the rest of the world.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.170
A lot of people say it's not
good to have the CEO as

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.420
chairman of the board.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:42.000
The board of directors
are not generally

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.760
working at the company.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.930
The board of directors are
people who were brought

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:50.880
together to give wisdom
to the company.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.030
And this is what happens.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.830
You're setting up a company and
you don't know where to go

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.350
and what to do.

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:58.200
You need someone to
run the company.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.140
That's the CEO.

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.050
And the CEO is probably a gung
ho guy who is going to work 80

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:05.750
hours a week and he's
ready to go.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.270
But he needs guidance, he
or she needs guidance.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.410
So, you get people with
different perspectives,

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:15.210
someone who ran a business years
ago and is retired or

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.830
any number of different
kinds of people.

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.150
And the board will meet more
regularly than the

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.500
shareholders.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.220
Shareholders don't want to get
involved typically, because

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.360
they typically own
many companies.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.540
They don't have time
to worry about it.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.510
If you keep a board small
enough, so there's not too

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:39.790
many people, like 6 to 10
people, and they know

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.530
everything about the company,
they're privy to all the

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:45.810
information.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.830
And they talk to each other at
regular big meetings and they

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.570
call each other up
on weekends.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:56.540
It's part of the concept of a
director that you just take

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.920
responsibility for
this company.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.140
You don't run it, but you're
responsible for it.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.830
The law says in the United
States that if you join the

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:10.270
board of directors, you have
a duty of loyalty to the

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.520
shareholders.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:20.230
That you were elected by the
shareholders to be on the

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:26.180
board, and you have a duty.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:29.090
You may not own any shares
in the company.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.870
Typically, you don't.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.040
And a member of the
board is paid some

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.620
token amount of money.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.620
You wonder why people do it.

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:41.400
They often do it just
to stay involved and

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.030
keep themselves learning.

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.930
They can make substantial money,
but they're not the

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:46.890
owners of the company.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.240
They don't get rich by it.

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.790
They're the wise people
that were brought in.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.040
You know, you joined
the board.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.340
You're taking on a
responsibility.

00:21:56.340 --> 00:22:00.280
You're not taking on a massive
responsibility.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:05.670
You only meet a minimum, maybe,
of four times a year.

00:22:05.670 --> 00:22:07.380
You'll be on phone calls.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:08.600
But you have some

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.960
responsibility for the company.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.450
And some people like that.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.140
They sense that, well, I'm a
productive part of society.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.240
I have this company.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.840
I'll learn all about and think
about it in a broader

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.090
perspective.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.840
So, that seems to work.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.230
This sort of organization seems
to work really well.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:31.310
You know what will happen?

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:36.100
The board will be talking
informally among themselves

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.170
and they'll say, is this CEO
really doing a good job?

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:41.360
And they think about it.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.730
I want to just ask around
with our customers.

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.220
What do they think?

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:52.250
And so, someone might say, we
could just get a new CEO.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.530
Let's do it.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.650
And then the guy's out
immediately, if they vote at

00:22:56.650 --> 00:22:57.990
the board meeting.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:02.090
This is a structure that keeps
companies really good.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:07.940
In one of the previous
semesters, I had Carl Icahn

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:11.320
come, who is a notorious
board breaker.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.530
Well, he comes in --

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:20.320
he told our class here that he
likes to buy enough shares in

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.060
a company to get himself on the
board, and he loves to go

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.900
and show up at board meetings.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.760
He buys companies, where there's
relatively ineffective

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.170
boards and the board is not
really paying attention.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:35.520
They're kind of lazy.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.060
And he comes in and makes
shocking statements, like fire

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.240
the CEO right now.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.930
This guy's a loser.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.550
And the board gets all
upset, because they

00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:46.480
kind of like the guy.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.870
It's cozy.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.110
But Icahn says, you
know I can do it.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:53.210
I go in there and I
lay it all out.

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.330
And it may take a
few meetings.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:57.620
I can bring them around
and get the company

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.970
straightened out.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:01.920
So, this is shareholder
democracy, how it works well.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.420
Not everyone agrees with Carl
Icahn's interpretation.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:13.490
He's a controversial guy.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.120
Now, another thing I want to
say, there are basically two

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.290
kinds of corporations.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.446
There's for-profit
and nonprofit.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.990
I've been talking about
for-profit.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:29.120
And all these people
[correction: companies]

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.310
I had on the screen as listed
shares are for-profit.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.470
That means they have
shareholders.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.360
There's another kind
of a corporation,

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.610
which is called nonprofit.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.630
And we're standing
in one right now.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:45.500
It's called Yale University.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.060
It's a nonprofit corporation.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.350
And it has a board
of directors.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.430
They call it the Corporation.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.350
They meet regularly.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.870
It's like other corporations,
but there are no shareholders.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.590
So, how can that be?

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.700
Who owns Yale?

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.420
Well, it's a person.

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.960
Yale University, like other
universities, is a legal

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.210
person, and its rights
are defined by law.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:22.430
And the profits go back to Yale
and accumulate there and

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:27.560
are spent for a cause, namely
education and research.

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:32.350
So, the board of directors of
Yale has a different purpose.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.490
They don't have any duty of
loyalty to shareholders,

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.330
because there are
no shareholders.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:43.040
I mean we could call you
shareholders as students here,

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.000
but that's not what you're
called, and you don't have any

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.320
right to the profits.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.350
The profits are spent
for good causes.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.360
So, you wonder, well, those
two sound very different,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.270
don't they?

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.730
Because a for-profit is trying
to make money, and the

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.270
nonprofit is doing something
for a cause.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.040
That seems totally different.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.440
But they're not always totally
different, because a lot of

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:12.800
what happens in corporations is
determined by the sociology

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.735
or the organizational
structure.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.750
Some people serve on
multiple boards.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:24.360
They'll be on Yale University
and they'll be on some other

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:29.670
company, for-profit, but the
same person probably behaves

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.640
similarly in both places.

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:37.040
So, oddly enough, for-profit
and nonprofit don't

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:38.590
often mean that much.

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:42.330
We're going to come back to
nonprofits later in this

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:47.940
semester, but I'm really talking
about for-profit.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:52.690
Now, that sounds kind of
selfish in a sense.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.280
A lot of us like nonprofits
better.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.000
They have a different cachet
in our society.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.770
I was talking to Peter Tufano,
who's a professor at Harvard

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:07.310
Business School, who set up
a nonprofit company called

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:10.730
''Doorways to Dreams.'' That's
the name of his company.

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:11.460
There's a website.

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.040
Search on Doorways to Dreams.
And it's all about finance for

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.650
the poor, the less represented
people.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.600
And he said setting up a
nonprofit was the greatest

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:30.530
thing he ever did, because
it opens doors for him.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:34.390
He walks in and says, I'm
running a nonprofit to benefit

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.310
poor people in the United
States, getting their

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.580
financial things in order.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.740
He said, everyone respects me.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:46.390
If I say I'm trying to make a
profit, they were skeptical.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.220
We have one professor in our
econ department, Dean Karlan,

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:57.260
who set up a big nonprofit
at Yale.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.510
That's kind of rare.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.310
His is called ''Innovations for
Poverty Action.'' And just

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.670
last night, I had a door-to-door
surprise.

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:14.940
I had a young Yale freshman come
by asking me to donate

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.190
here in New Haven.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.740
I guess Yale gets donations.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:24.740
It's all ambiguous, but private
companies don't get

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:25.990
donations generally.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.580
All right, the value of a share
in the company is equal

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:34.470
to the total value of the
company divided by

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.720
the number of shares.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.170
So, the market cap of a company
is equal to the value

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.030
per share times the
number of shares.

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:56.480
Market cap is short for market
capitalization, and that is

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.730
the value of the company.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:10.490
The key thing you have to know
about a company is, how many

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:13.990
shares are there and how
many shares do I have?

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.690
Maybe I'm repeating myself,
but if there's a million

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:25.240
shares outstanding and I own
1,000 shares, I own 1/1000 of

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:29.415
everything the company owns
after their debt.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:37.080
But if there's 10 million shares
and I own 1,000 shares,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.810
then I own only 1/10,000.

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.760
So, you have to know the
number of shares.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.640
The number of shares that you
own is meaningless, unless you

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:48.950
know the total number of
shares in the company.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:52.290
And all the different shares
are treated equally.

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.860
If they pay out any money to one
shareholder, they've got

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.030
to pay it out to all the other
shareholders in proportion to

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.110
the number of shares.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.550
Now, companies issue
dividends.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:15.870
A dividend is paid to
shareholders when the board of

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.720
directors decides to do it.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.380
And the board of directors
doesn't have to do it.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:24.340
I'm talking now exclusively
about for-profit, all right?

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.050
So, at a board meeting,
they can say,

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.450
hey, let's pay a dividend.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.550
I remember this, because we had
exactly this meeting at

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:34.950
our little company.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.400
We gave shares to all of our
employees to motivate them.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.010
Everyone's a shareholder.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.550
But they had tiny numbers.

00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:43.670
Some of them had very
little shares.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:46.460
And we had a board meeting and
we said, you know we've never

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:48.880
paid a dividend.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:49.680
Should we do it?

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.440
Should we pay a dividend?

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:55.070
And then we had a discussion,
and someone said, well, you

00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.440
know all these employees wonder
if their shares are

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:58.510
worth anything.

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.150
Maybe, if they got a check in
the mail, they'd feel better.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.600
But you see, the dividend is
subject to the discretion of

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.740
the company.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.473
Ultimately, people own shares
to get dividends.

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.990
The dividend is the distribution
of profits.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:22.290
If a company never distributed
dividends, it would be like a

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:24.120
nonprofit --

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.340
if they kept all the profits.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.150
They can do that.

00:31:27.150 --> 00:31:29.110
There's no law saying
that they have

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.330
to distribute dividends.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.210
They can just keep it in the
company and, like Yale

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:37.120
University, get a huge endowment
and just let it get

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.370
bigger and bigger.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.590
But the whole purpose
of a for-profit

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.200
company is to pay dividends.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.760
And so, sooner or later they
do it, but typically young

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.720
companies don't pay dividends.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.460
Why not?

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.360
Because everybody knows that
our money is in the future.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.230
We're starting up.

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.540
We're not making
a lot of money.

00:31:56.540 --> 00:32:00.430
In the future, we'll have a
lot of money, so let's pay

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:03.500
dividends later.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.850
For example Microsoft, that I'm
going to describe, went

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.590
through decades without ever
paying a dividend.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.580
They just kept plowing it
back into the company.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.130
Now, if you knew that they would
never pay a dividend,

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:17.660
then you wouldn't want to
own Microsoft shares.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.010
But you think, well, eventually
they're going to,

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.950
so that's why you
own the company.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.410
This is a very common
misunderstanding.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.330
A lot of people think that you
buy stocks because the price

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.840
will go up.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.690
Well, the price will go up
only because people think

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:35.320
there are more dividends
coming.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.810
At least in theory, that's
the way it should be.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.090
The price ought to be --

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:42.280
and we'll question
this later --

00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:45.650
the present value of expected
future dividends.

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:47.800
So, the true value
of a company is

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:49.640
entirely in the dividends.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.670
It seems a little funny, because
you think, well, the

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.520
board of directors doesn't have
to pay a dividend and

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.220
they could just get nasty
and never pay it out.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:01.830
But remember, you elect the
board of directors.

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.910
And so, if you're frustrated
that our company is

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.650
accumulating lots of money and
it's not paying it out.

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.160
I want the money, right?

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.130
So, I'm not going to vote
for this board.

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:13.100
I'll put Carl Icahn on
or someone else.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.460
Pay it out.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.040
And then that's what happens,
they start paying it out.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.570
When they pay out a dividend,
the share price falls

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:24.030
generally, right?

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:24.890
Very simple.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.360
Why would the share price fall
when they pay out a dividend?

00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.170
Well, because the company
is worth less.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.610
They had this money and they
paid it out, so it should fall

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.460
by the amount they paid
out divided by

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:38.490
the number of shares.

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:40.590
And companies do
that routinely.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.880
When they declare a dividend,
price falls.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.590
It's called the ex-dividend
price, and they show it in

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.710
newspapers.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.000
They used to show it
in newspapers.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.010
Now, it would be
on the website.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:55.360
They put a little x by the stock
price on the day after a

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.840
dividend is paid to tell you
that the price decline that

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.050
you just saw is not anything
to worry about.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.469
It doesn't mean there's bad
news about the company.

00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:07.830
It just means they just
paid a dividend.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.190
So, the price routinely
goes down by the

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.719
amount of the dividend.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:14.699
It doesn't mean anything.

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:18.820
Some stockbrokers have tried
to alarm investors about

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.310
dividend payment dates
and mislead them.

00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:28.409
Some stockbrokers would say,
why don't you buy the stock

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:30.550
right now, because if you
buy it right now,

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:31.170
you'll get a dividend.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.400
They're going to pay a dividend
in three days.

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.659
Hurry up and buy it and you'll
get the dividend.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.969
That's called selling dividends
and it's considered

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:43.530
unethical for a broker ever to
tell you that, because it

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.110
really doesn't matter.

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:48.290
Because if you buy it later,
you won't get the dividend,

00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:49.545
but you'll get the
share cheaper.

00:34:49.545 --> 00:34:53.350
And it all comes out
to about the same.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.520
You don't have to worry about
dividend payment dates,

00:34:55.520 --> 00:35:02.330
because the stock price jumps
down right after a dividend.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:04.760
Except maybe for some
second-order effects, it

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:13.736
doesn't matter whether you buy
before or after a dividend.

00:35:13.736 --> 00:35:16.130
All right, so, you see
the idea here.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:21.200
The idea of a corporation is we
have these shares, and the

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.080
shares are always salable.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:27.330
So, let's say four of us young
people form a company.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.910
And then after a couple of
years, one of us says, I've

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.800
got another job.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.870
I'm tired of this.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.740
I want out.

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.460
And you say, fine.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.490
We'll buy your shares back.

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.200
And we agree on a price.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.030
So, it's very fair and easy.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.510
People can get in and
out as they please.

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:46.240
And the only people involved
are people

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.440
who want to be involved.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.060
And then you'll find
some new person.

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.880
The four of us set
up a company.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.460
There's some new guy who
just heard of us.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.910
And he thinks, this
a great idea.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:58.340
I want in.

00:35:58.340 --> 00:35:59.270
So, then you say, all right.

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.590
We'll sell you shares
in the company.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.560
But maybe the price
has changed.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.880
When we started, we might have
been worth a lot less.

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:10.260
The guy has to come in at a new
price, and the price is

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.930
changing every day.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.210
It makes very good sense.

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:17.570
So moreover, if the company
needs to raise money to do

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:17.810
business --

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:21.150
So, we've started a company
and we need to build a new

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.470
factory, let's say, to
expand our operation.

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.690
Well, we can go out
and issue more

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:30.270
shares to buy the factory.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:33.810
So, we go to a stockbroker,
who is like a real estate

00:36:33.810 --> 00:36:38.990
broker, who deals in
markets for shares.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.190
I'm talking about a small
company, so I'm thinking of a

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:45.270
private company for which
there's no stock market price.

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.820
But the stockbroker can go out
and say, I'll find a buyer.

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.750
I have various contacts.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:56.820
I know people who deal with
wealthy individuals looking

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.610
around for an investment.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.520
Maybe this person will buy some
shares, and then you'll

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.700
get the money.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:04.770
That's an alternative.

00:37:04.770 --> 00:37:06.930
That's called equity
financing.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.670
That's an alternative to
financing by debt.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.710
Your company could also go to
a bank and ask for a loan,

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.700
called a corporate loan.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.130
Or your company could borrow
money on the bond market, by

00:37:21.130 --> 00:37:21.980
issuing bonds.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:24.220
You can go to a broker
and say, we want to

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.090
sell corporate bonds.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.770
But the difference of those is
that it's at a fixed interest

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:33.870
rate and it's not a share
in the profits.

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:39.530
So, equity financing tends to
attract lively investors who

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.230
take risks.

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:47.950
If a company gets debt, then the
debt leverages up the risk

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:52.260
of the company, because you as
a shareholder now are paid

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.650
only after the debtors
are paid.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.640
You own the value of the
company, which is the assets

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.730
minus the liabilities,
as a shareholder.

00:38:01.730 --> 00:38:05.040
But you've got to subtract
off the liabilities.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.400
So, companies have a choice
of how to finance their

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.630
operations.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.890
Typically they start
out with equity.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.800
I guess they could start out
with debt as well, but in our

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.610
case of our little company, it
was all equity at first, and

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:25.330
then we got bank loans and so
we started to get leveraged.

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:29.780
And that's what happens.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:31.980
Big companies do
the same thing.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.150
I'd like to talk about the
simple company that you might

00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.490
set up with your friends,
because it seems so personal

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:40.440
and you can imagine
doing that, right?

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.930
You can imagine the kind of
conflicts that you would have.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.890
But these little companies have
a way of growing really,

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:47.500
really big.

00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.580
So, I'm going to talk about a
little company set up by Bill

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.190
Gates and Paul Allen in 1975.

00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:58.490
Bill Gates was an undergraduate
at Harvard and

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.930
he saw an opportunity
and he dropped out.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:03.870
He was right.

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.060
He never got his
Harvard degree.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:10.260
I suggest that if you see such
an opportunity, you do the

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:10.910
same thing.

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.160
I hate to say it.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.550
If you can see an opportunity
like that.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:19.620
It started out with just
Bill and Paul and

00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:20.810
their little company.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:23.300
But they have a way to grow into
bigger and bigger things.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.810
The question is, are they
really different later?

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.810
So, one important question is
about whether big companies

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:37.810
really use equity financing.

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:40.370
Are they still functioning
the way I'm describing?

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.470
See, I set the idea of a company
up as a structure that

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.840
lawyers invented that allows
people to work together and

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.990
allows them to get in and
out of the company.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:54.960
Does it really still work that
way for really big companies?

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.580
There's been a complaint about
the stock market, that the

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.880
companies generally don't issue
any more shares once

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:04.590
they're big.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.360
This is a complaint.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.890
I'm not saying it's right.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:10.310
And that the stock market
ends up as a market

00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:11.655
for existing shares.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:20.250
The idea is, are the stock
markets of the world

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.450
functioning to make capitalism
work better?

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:27.620
Well, I could say, they should
be, because the price of a

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.140
share of a company is an
indicator of the value of the

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.900
company and it directs
resources.

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.360
I mean, people look at that
price and they decide where to

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:39.410
invest. But if they're
not issuing any more

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:42.760
shares, does it matter?

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.840
I had a quote from
Karl Marx here.

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.016
You've heard of Karl Marx,
the founder of communism.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.685
In his book, Capital, Das
Kapital, his classic

00:40:55.685 --> 00:41:00.550
work, he said: --

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.560
I'm quoting Marx --

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.080
"Since property here exists
in the form of stock, its

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:10.310
movement and transfer become
purely a result of gambling on

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:13.880
the stock exchange, where the
little fish are swallowed by

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.450
the sharks and the lambs
by the stock

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.740
exchange wolves." OK.

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:23.620
That was Marx's view, but even
in communist countries, that

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.070
view doesn't seem to be
holding sway anymore.

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:33.530
The thing that lent some
credibility to these theories

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:37.920
is that it often seems that big
companies don't issue many

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.800
shares anymore.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.600
I'm going to qualify that.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:50.480
But there was a very influential
article written by

00:41:50.480 --> 00:42:00.060
Stewart Myers, who's a professor
of finance at MIT.

00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:07.900
And that was in the Journal
of Finance in 1984.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.990
And he gave some statistics.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:15.570
This was an influential article,
making it sound like

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.700
shares don't really matter
for a big company.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:29.470
He said, how do companies really
finance their needs?

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.695
And he came up with data.

00:42:30.695 --> 00:42:37.790
This is Myers's data
from 1973 to 1982.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:47.790
And he found that 62% of
corporate financing needs came

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:51.560
from, in the United States,
retained earnings.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:59.450
What he's saying is, companies
didn't sell new shares, they

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.810
just accumulated profits.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.280
And then, when they had to build
a new factory, they went

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.670
to their own piggyback and they
bought the new factory or

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.890
whatever it was they needed.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:13.287
And only 6% was equity issued.

00:43:13.287 --> 00:43:17.040
This is for the whole
U.S. stock market.

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:20.390
And the rest was debt that they
would borrow money for.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:25.560
So, Stewart Myers said, you know
all this idea that stock

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:29.930
markets function to allocate
resources and the share market

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.340
means something is really
misleading.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.904
So, what he proposed is
what he called the

00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:37.305
Pecking Order Theory.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.880
What he meant is, companies
really don't want

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.140
to issue new shares.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.320
They just don't want to do it.

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.380
We own this company.

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.710
We're not letting
more people in.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:52.500
So, what they first do
is they just try to

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.590
save their own money.

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.270
This is Myers' explanation.

00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:59.630
Companies save money and when
they have money, they spend it

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.880
on expanding.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.460
That's the highest on
the pecking order.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:07.960
They like that the best. But if
they really need money and

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:11.660
they can't save enough to
expand, they have a lot of

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:13.370
expansion opportunity.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.900
They'll go to a bank
and borrow.

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:18.600
They'll go to an investment
bank and issue bonds.

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.530
And then, only if it's really,
really important and they

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:24.740
can't get enough money,
they will go to

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.940
selling their shares.

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.290
So, I don't know if Stewart
Myers said Karl Marx was

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.350
right, but he seemed to be
saying that equity issuance

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.620
just wasn't that important.

00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.960
However, I think that
is misleading.

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.790
I'm going to refer now to
another article that came in

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.990
much later criticizing Myers.

00:44:47.990 --> 00:45:00.850
And the article is by Eugene
Fama and Kenneth French, at

00:45:00.850 --> 00:45:04.710
Chicago and Dartmouth
respectively.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:14.510
They wrote an article in 2005.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:19.450
This is in the Journal of
Financial Economics in 2005.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:22.710
They said that the problem with
Myers's Pecking Order

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:27.300
Theory is that Myers was looking
at aggregate data and

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.270
he was looking at a time
period when there was

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:32.410
relatively little issuance
of equity.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:36.800
When Myers said only 6% of
corporate financing comes from

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.080
equity issuance, they were
talking about net equity,

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:47.340
that's total new sales of shares
by companies minus

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.340
repurchases of shares
by companies.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.280
And so, it averaged out
to be a low number.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:59.600
But in fact, as Fama and French
point out, in the same

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:09.590
years that Myers studied, from
1973 to '82, 67% of U.S.

00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:15.040
companies issued new
shares each year.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:20.460
And also in subsequent years,
the percentage went up.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:29.130
From 1993 to 2002, it was 86%.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.070
So, they're all issuing
shares.

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:33.030
It's just that some
are issuing and

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:35.000
some are buying back.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:43.650
So, I think that we should
conclude that companies really

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:48.820
do use equity financing,
even big companies.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:51.850
And the stock market
is important

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.380
for the price discovery.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.840
I wanted to remind you
of the term dilution.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.600
Dilution refers to what happens
when a company issues

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.820
more shares.

00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:08.740
So, imagine that you
are showing up at a

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.432
shareholders meeting.

00:47:09.432 --> 00:47:10.682
The board has decided
to issue --

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.750
Let's say our company has a
million shares outstanding.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:19.180
They've decided to
issue another

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.310
million at $10 a share.

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.670
And so, what do you
think about that?

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:28.470
Well, if the company had a
million shares, and I owned

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:33.310
1,000 shares, then I own 1/1,000
of the company, right?

00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.460
If they issue another million
shares, then there'll be two

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:41.100
million shares, and I'll own
only 1/2,000 of the company.

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:43.620
So, my first thought is
I don't like that.

00:47:43.620 --> 00:47:45.540
I owned 1/1,000 of the
company, and now

00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:47.220
I'm falling in half.

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:49.100
But they would say, on the
other hand, look, we're

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:52.555
selling them for $10 a share,
so the company will have $10

00:47:52.555 --> 00:47:57.350
million to invest. So, even
though your fraction of the

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.390
company has been diluted, the
company is worth more.

00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.360
Then, you have to decide whether
$10 a share is a good

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.200
enough price.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.360
Is it worth that?

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.230
And so, it's never obvious.

00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:11.820
You always have to consider
dilution, because anything

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:15.780
that expands the number of
shares decreases your interest

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.550
in the company.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.140
The opposite of dilution occurs
when the company buys

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.860
back its shares.

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:29.490
That's repurchase of shares
by a company.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:30.620
A company can always do that.

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:32.820
They can decide to
go either way.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.240
If they need more money, they
can issue shares, and if they

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:44.480
want to get money out, they
can buy back shares.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.770
And these things are
very common.

00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:49.740
There are statistics, like what
Fama and French showed

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.840
for equity issuance,
which show that

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.250
repurchases are very common.

00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:03.820
And it happens all the
time in the market.

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.500
That's what makes the stock
market so active.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.480
One reason traditionally
for share

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.900
repurchases is tax reasons.

00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:21.730
If a company pays a dividend,
that goes in as income to the

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.390
shareholders and it's taxed.

00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:26.950
It used to be taxed at a higher
rate than capital

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:29.310
gains, so there was an
advantage to share

00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.090
repurchases.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:34.490
Instead of paying dividends, I
should just buy back shares.

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:41.050
And then the shareholders would
have a better tax --

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:44.070
they would be taxed at a
more advantageous rate.

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.260
But now the tax rate on
dividends and the tax rate on

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.570
capital gains is the same, but
still there's always going to

00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:52.200
be complicated tax issues.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:56.910
And so, issues of taxation may
still motivate some decisions

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.560
about share repurchase.

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.940
But you have to understand that
it's getting money out of

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.870
the company.

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:06.050
And as a shareholder, if the
company wants to send me a

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.700
dividend, I say fine,
I've got money.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.150
If the company says I want to
buy some of your shares back,

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.720
you say fine, I've got money.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.330
I don't care.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:22.990
And so, if they buy back 5% of
all their shares, then the

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.490
total number of shares
goes down.

00:50:24.490 --> 00:50:26.631
My fraction of the company is
the same [correction: the

00:50:26.631 --> 00:50:28.630
fraction increases],
and I've got money.

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:30.070
It's the same as getting
a dividend.

00:50:30.070 --> 00:50:33.130
So, you can be confused
by these things.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.540
Dilution and repurchase are
neither good nor bad.

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.900
It depends on circumstances.

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:43.610
And you have to look at the
business and what's being done

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:44.860
with the money.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:49.280
I wanted to mention, there's
another kind of

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.306
share called preferred.

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:57.210
I've been talking here
about common stock.

00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:06.530
Common stock is the real
ownership in the company.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.420
In other words, you take
all the profits.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:13.730
They're the ultimate owners
of the company.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:17.570
Nobody is above them
in the hierarchy.

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.210
But there's something
close that's

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:21.140
considered close but different.

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.300
It's called preferred stock.

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.966
And preferred stock has
a set dividend.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.770
The contract says that the
dividend is so many dollars

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:45.090
per year, and the board doesn't
have to pay it.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:50.120
But typically, the contract
says they cannot pay a

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:53.360
dividend to the common
shareholders until all the

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:56.990
dividends to the preferred
shareholders are paid up.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.630
And the preferred shareholders
typically don't have a vote.

00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:01.500
OK.

00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.340
So, this is it.

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.030
You could buy preferred stock
in some company and then you

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:07.640
would know exactly what
your dividend is.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.010
Usually, they just
pay a dividend.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.990
It's like owning a bond.

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.500
And it's always the
same amount.

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.400
So, you're not betting on the
company doing better or worse

00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:19.960
generally, but if it does badly,
you might lose your

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.910
dividend for a while.

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.360
If a company goes bankrupt,
well, then you're out.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.575
But if the company starts doing
well again, they've got

00:52:28.575 --> 00:52:32.210
to go back and make up for all
the dividends they missed.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:38.300
So, preferred shares are safer
than common shares, but they

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:39.900
lack the upside potential.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:43.820
They're not as exciting
as common shares.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:50.540
So, when General Motors got
into a crisis, the U.S.

00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:53.430
government bailed out
General Motors.

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.830
What they did was
to buy preferred

00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.800
shares in General Motors.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.510
So, the U.S. government was
a preferred stockholder in

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.250
General Motors.

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:06.900
Why did the U.S. government
do that?

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:10.090
Why did they buy preferred
shares rather than common?

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:13.030
Well, they now do have common
shares as well.

00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:16.190
I think the government wanted
to not be a stockholder, not

00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:19.370
to be a voter in GM.

00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.730
They wanted to keep
their distance,

00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:22.840
because this is America.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:24.450
This is a capitalist country.

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:28.820
If the U.S. bought common shares
in General Motors, it's

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.780
like nationalizing the
company, right?

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.800
The government would
be on the board.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.690
They would have the votes.

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:37.460
They just didn't want to go
that far, so they bought

00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:39.450
preferred shares in
General Motors.

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.500
Later, General Motors got on its
feet again and bought back

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:45.920
the government's preferred
shares.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:49.680
So, the government is no longer
a preferred shareholder

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.800
in General Motors.

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:57.240
Common is much more important
than preferred.

00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.170
OK.

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:05.400
Now, I'm going to talk a little
bit about dividends.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.070
What determines whether
a firm pays dividends?

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.400
There's a famous article
by John Lintner.

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:22.210
John Lintner was a professor at
the Harvard Business School

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:26.320
and also one of the inventors
of the Capital

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:29.750
Asset Pricing Model.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:35.060
He wrote an article in --

00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:35.750
when was it?

00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:38.450
It was a long time ago --

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:42.170
about why firms pay dividends.

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:46.480
Remember, it's a judgment call
by the board of directors.

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.490
So, he interviewed people who
were involved in those

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:53.190
judgments and asked them, why
do you pay dividends?

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.270
Why did you decide to pay a
dividend of a certain amount?

00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:59.090
And he wrote a long article
about this.

00:54:59.090 --> 00:55:01.420
And he found out that it was
impossible to summarize

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.730
everything they said.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.970
They said so many different
things.

00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:09.260
Corporations are very complex,
and there's a lot of different

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.950
people, who have different
feelings.

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.200
And we're trying to
keep people happy.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.180
And you want the company to do
well and be perceived well.

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.640
One thing he learned is that
companies think that our job

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:25.740
is to pay dividends.

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.770
You don't have to earn
an income now.

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:29.150
You're young, right?

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.730
Eventually people are going to
get fed up with you if you

00:55:31.730 --> 00:55:33.160
don't earn an income.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:33.990
So, it's the same thing.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.780
As a company matures, it's
part of life's passage.

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.010
You start paying dividends and
you take pride that you're

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.670
paying dividends and people are
getting money out of you.

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:45.450
You hear a lot of generalities
like that,

00:55:45.450 --> 00:55:48.060
but what really decides?

00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:50.740
And one thing he learned from
them is, they told him, you

00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:52.220
know one thing we don't
ever want to

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.810
do is cut our dividends.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:57.590
Once we start paying a dividend,
if we stopped, it'll

00:55:57.590 --> 00:55:58.980
get a lot of attention.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:01.550
Well, it's like for you.

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:02.600
You're young people.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.920
You don't have a job.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:05.590
Nobody is complaining.

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:07.620
You could go for a while
like this and say,

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.740
you're still young.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:14.500
But once you start at a job and
then you quit, it looks

00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.170
bad, right?

00:56:15.170 --> 00:56:18.240
If you're 40 years old and you
say, I'm just dropping out, it

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.310
looks worse than if you
do it at your age.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.570
It's the same for companies.

00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.470
Once they start paying a
dividend, they've got

00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:24.600
to keep paying it.

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:26.890
Otherwise people get angry.

00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.380
So, that was one theme.

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:33.060
But Lintner said, even that
doesn't tell the whole story.

00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:33.950
So, he tried to build a

00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:38.070
mathematical model of dividends.

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:41.450
And the model that he came up,
which he then fit to the data,

00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:46.810
and found that it worked very
well, was that these boards of

00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:51.420
directors have a target payout
ratio of earnings basically.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.060
This is the bottom line.

00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.360
They think they should pay out
a certain fraction of their

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:59.640
earnings, because the
shareholders will get mad if

00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.420
we're making a lot of
money and we're not

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:02.820
sharing it with you.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.800
So, maybe we'll pay out half of
our earnings, and the other

00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.960
half we'll keep as retained
earnings so that we don't have

00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.510
to go out and issue new equity
or borrow money.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.430
It all sounds reasonable.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.140
And then, because they don't
like to cut a dividend, they

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:19.170
don't want to adjust upward
quickly if earnings shoot up.

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.220
Because, if they go up and raise
their dividend, then

00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:23.810
they might have to cut it if
earnings go back down.

00:57:23.810 --> 00:57:28.010
So, this is the Lintner model.

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:33.550
And it is that the dividends
at time t --

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:38.370
year t, let's say -- minus
dividends at year t minus one

00:57:38.370 --> 00:57:42.530
equals rho times a number
tau -- that's the

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:44.450
Greek letter tau --

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:51.320
times earnings per share minus
dividend per share at time t

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:57.130
minus one plus noise.

00:57:57.130 --> 00:58:01.590
And tau is between 0 and 1.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.430
So, they have some fraction
of earnings that

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:06.470
they want to pay out.

00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:12.330
And if earnings per share
rise, so that tau times

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:14.470
earnings per share is greater
than dividends, then they

00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:16.020
increase their dividends.

00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:19.320
And rho is between 0 and 1.

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.270
That's the Lintner model.

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:24.640
And he showed with the data that
it pretty much summarizes

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.250
what firms are doing.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:30.300
So, they have a payout ratio
out of earnings.

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:32.110
And the payout ratio
has been declining

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:33.000
over the last century.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.830
It used to be typically
60% to 70%.

00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:40.095
In 1900, shareholders were
impatient with companies.

00:58:40.095 --> 00:58:42.210
They wanted to see the
money, but they let

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:44.200
them keep 30% or 40%.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:47.650
But now we've become more and
more believers in the stock

00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:52.360
market and we allow companies
to do better things.

00:58:55.010 --> 00:58:57.410
So, I said I would
talk about some

00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:01.360
examples of specific companies.

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.040
Let me get back to
my slides here.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.380
I wanted to start with Xerox.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.590
Xerox Corporation, you've
heard of it?

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:16.020
You've heard of Xerox?

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:16.740
It's still there.

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.650
It exists.

00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:22.860
Xerox Corporation was
founded in 1906.

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:24.970
It wasn't called Xerox.

00:59:24.970 --> 00:59:30.820
It was called the Haloid
Photographic Company, and they

00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.370
produced photographic
equipment.

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:39.720
But they had a big impetus
forward when they met Chester

00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.625
Carlson, who was an inventor.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:52.390
And what Chester Carlson
invented was a copying machine

00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:54.700
that used plain paper.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.230
They used to have copying
machines going all the way

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:01.590
back to 1906, but they
were very expensive.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.576
To get a copy of something, a
photographic copy, it would

01:00:05.576 --> 01:00:09.760
cost you maybe $1 a page, which
was extremely expensive

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.260
for that time.

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:14.500
But what Carlson invented
was a dry copier.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.120
It used to be that what they
had to do was take a

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.970
photograph of the document that
you wanted a copy of and

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:24.310
then process it through
the different

01:00:24.310 --> 01:00:25.655
chemicals that they use.

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:29.420
It comes out wet, and you
have to hang it out.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:31.910
That was expensive
and inconvenient.

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:34.040
They did have copying machines,
they just didn't

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.070
work very well.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.990
But he invented this process
that you could take any paper

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:41.830
and put it through, plain paper,
and it would come out

01:00:41.830 --> 01:00:45.760
hot and dry, and cheap.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.710
So, Xerox became an overnight
success, because they had a

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:52.900
patent on Carlson's thing.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:58.770
It became the glamour company
of the 1960's and 1970's.

01:00:58.770 --> 01:01:04.270
So, it was one of
the Nifty Fifty.

01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:09.120
People were very impressed
with Xerox in its day.

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:12.030
So, Xerox means dry in Greek.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:14.330
It's a dry copier.

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:18.340
And it was considered a high
tech company, moving forward

01:01:18.340 --> 01:01:23.510
rapidly, but then it
suffered a problem.

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.150
Do you know what the
problem was?

01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:28.970
It was doing really well, until
sometime in the 1990's

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:30.850
when another invention came.

01:01:30.850 --> 01:01:32.680
And it wasn't Xerox's.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.790
It's called digital copying
machines, where the machine

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:40.900
would have a computer that would
scan in the document and

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:41.990
then produce a copy.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:46.130
And it had a lot of advantages
over the Xerox copier.

01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:50.250
So, the company almost
went under.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:52.650
What I've got here
is the balance

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:56.510
sheet from Xerox Company.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:02:02.920
And this comes from a website,
sec.gov. And I got this from

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.130
the 10-Q report.

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:10.350
Xerox is a public company,
not a private company.

01:02:10.350 --> 01:02:12.460
It's traded on stock
exchanges.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:18.020
So, U.S. law says, any public
company must file a quarterly

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.920
report with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and they

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.190
put it up on their website.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:25.540
This is the website.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:30.140
So, any public company's balance
sheet is on the web.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:33.250
And it's there updated
every three months.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:34.710
And I've got a couple
of them here.

01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:39.630
I've got 1999 and 2010.

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:42.150
My little company, Case Shiller
Weiss Incorporated, it

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.890
was not public, so our balance
sheet was never up there on

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:50.790
sec.gov. That's one of the
disadvantages, many people

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.460
say, of becoming public.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.370
If you start out as a private
company and you want to get

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:58.820
listed on the stock exchange,
that's called going public.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.450
When you go public, the SEC is
on your back and it says, you

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:07.220
now have to file those quarterly
balance sheets.

01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:08.360
So, this is what I've got.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:13.720
So, this is Xerox, and it's all
up there on sec.gov. I've

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.040
got it for 1999.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.940
This was right at the time
when they were really in

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.660
trouble, because the digital
revolution was killing Xerox.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.410
And I just wanted to show a
balance sheet of a company,

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:32.170
because there's two sides
to the balance sheet.

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:34.350
There's assets and
liabilities.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:36.690
Assets are things the
company owns.

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:39.750
Liabilities are debts
the company has.

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.760
So, this is one side of the
balance sheet, but I've got it

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.420
for two years.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:45.710
And everything is in millions.

01:03:48.230 --> 01:04:04.360
Xerox had $126 million in cash
in 1999 and they picked up.

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.600
The company was dying in 1999.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:13.390
In 2001, they hired a new CEO,
Anne Mulcahy, and she is

01:04:13.390 --> 01:04:17.860
credited with saving Xerox,
turning the company around.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.730
So, by 2010, at least in terms
of cash, they are doing

01:04:21.730 --> 01:04:23.870
better, but maybe not
a lot better.

01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:28.740
She saved it from extinction,
but she didn't move it back on

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.990
to the Nifty Fifty.

01:04:32.770 --> 01:04:34.940
So, I just wanted to look at
what a company owns, and this

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.560
is just an example of
a balance sheet.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.900
So, Xerox owned $15 billion
of receivables in 1999.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.710
It was a much lower
number in 2010.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:46.200
I don't know.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.670
It might reflect time of
the year or something.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:51.950
Receivables is money that's
owed to them.

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:54.350
They ship their copying
machine to someone.

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.360
The guy says, I'll pay
you in three months.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.610
That's a receivable.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.720
And they had inventories.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:07.260
That means, probably, copying
machines ready to be sent out.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.880
And they own buildings.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.625
The buildings, it looks like
it went down under Mulcahy.

01:05:13.625 --> 01:05:18.160
It went down from $2.4 billion
to $1.6 billion.

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.300
And then, there's a lot
of other things.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.740
So, the value of everything that
the company owns wasn't

01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.440
much changed.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:32.050
$28.8 billion went up
to $30 billion.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:37.170
So, at least she stopped the
company from failing.

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:38.860
But now that's only half
of the balance sheet.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:40.800
I have to go to the
other half.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.640
And these are the liabilities.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:49.610
This is what the company owes.

01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:51.650
So, it has short-term debt.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:52.930
Let's talk about 2010.

01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:55.000
$1.6 billion.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.180
Long-term debt of
$7.8 billion.

01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.750
Deferred taxes.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.715
That means taxes that they know
they have to pay that

01:06:00.715 --> 01:06:01.500
they haven't paid.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:04.640
They didn't have any in 2010.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.470
And preferred stock.

01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:10.460
They did have a small amount
of preferred stock

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:14.060
outstanding, which counts
as a liability.

01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.520
All right.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.350
And then, other liabilities.

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.760
I put them all into
one category.

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.450
Now, this last liability
is unique,

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:25.795
because it's the residual.

01:06:25.795 --> 01:06:28.620
It's called shareholders'
equity.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:31.200
This number, the total
liabilities, has to equal the

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.240
total assets.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.090
This is the same number
that I showed you on

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.030
the preceding page.

01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.830
What's the difference?

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:38.820
It's the shareholders equity.

01:06:38.820 --> 01:06:39.630
OK?

01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:47.770
So, it's $11.9 billion in 2010,
up from $4.9 billion.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:51.610
So, by this measure,
it's a success.

01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:54.430
Now what is shareholders'
equity?

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:56.180
Is this the value
of the company?

01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.320
No, it's the value of the
company on the books.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.650
So, according to
their books --

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:03.480
I'll go back to it.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.410
They have all these
assets, including

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.370
buildings and equipment.

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.350
Where did they come up
with this number?

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:12.050
How do they know what
their buildings and

01:07:12.050 --> 01:07:13.530
equipment are worth?

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:16.770
It's an estimate, because
who knows what they

01:07:16.770 --> 01:07:18.020
could sell them for.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:24.070
So, in principle, this
shareholders' equity is what

01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:29.100
the shares are worth, all of
the shares, $11.9 billion.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.730
Because if you bought the
company and you sold all the

01:07:32.730 --> 01:07:34.790
assets and paid off all
the debts, that's

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:36.100
what would be left.

01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.620
So, you divide that by the
number of shares and you can

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.070
get an estimate of the
value of a share.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:43.300
But I say an estimate.

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:46.790
It's not the same as
the market value.

01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:50.890
In 2010, there were
1.4 billion shares

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:53.880
outstanding in Xerox.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:57.130
The price per share
of a Xerox common

01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:01.810
share in 2010 was $11.80.

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:04.770
So, if I multiply the number
of shares by the price per

01:08:04.770 --> 01:08:11.680
share, the market cap for
Xerox is $16.4 billion.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:14.319
Compare that with the
shareholders'

01:08:14.319 --> 01:08:18.310
equity of $11.9 billion.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.910
So, the company is worth more
than its shareholders equity.

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.760
And you might ask, why
would that be?

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.090
OK?

01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:30.880
Well, I think the answer is, you
wouldn't buy this company

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.620
to shut it down.

01:08:32.620 --> 01:08:36.790
You could buy the company for
$16 billion and then shut it

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.319
down, sell off all the assets,
pay off all the debts, and

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:42.500
you'd have $11 billion.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.649
So, that's a sign of Anne
Mulcahy's success.

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:50.410
Her company is not going
to be shut down.

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:54.850
If the stock price falls below
the shareholders' equity, it

01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:57.779
becomes at risk for
being shut down.

01:08:57.779 --> 01:09:01.330
Somebody buys the company and
shuts it down, because I can

01:09:01.330 --> 01:09:01.729
make money.

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:03.225
If the company were
selling for $5

01:09:03.225 --> 01:09:05.520
billion, I might do that.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.640
Well, not me.

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:10.590
Somebody who arranges these
things could do that.

01:09:10.590 --> 01:09:12.640
So, I buy the company
for $5 billion.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.670
I tell everybody, you're
all fired.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:16.189
We're going out of business.

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:17.040
I sell it.

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:18.680
I get $11.9 billion.

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:20.160
I've doubled my money.

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:22.620
All right.

01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.580
Now, a company can sell for less
than the shareholders'

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.229
equity, because the
shareholders' equity is kind

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.670
of a funny number.

01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:32.500
It's also called stockholders'
equity by some

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.399
people, same thing.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:36.910
It's a funny number,
because it involves

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:37.899
all kinds of estimates.

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:40.340
And if you really try to sell
that real estate for what it

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:42.270
says here, you might
find problems.

01:09:42.270 --> 01:09:49.780
So, the market capitalization
can follow below shareholders'

01:09:49.780 --> 01:09:53.030
equity, but probably
not too far below.

01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:56.830
And this is what worries
boards and CEOs.

01:09:56.830 --> 01:09:59.810
They watch their stock price
every day and they've got in

01:09:59.810 --> 01:10:02.170
their mind that shareholders'
equity.

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:05.180
And if the stock is falling
below that, then they're in

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:06.280
danger of liquidation.

01:10:06.280 --> 01:10:08.240
So, they worry.

01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.820
And that's why every morning, if
you are a CEO, if you're a

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:16.560
CEO of a public company, you
will be watching your market

01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:20.000
cap every day and comparing that
with shareholders equity.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.680
So, Xerox is an example
of a company that's

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.590
doing all right now.

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:27.210
I'll show you its price.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.740
I don't have it all the way
back to 1906, but this is

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:34.920
Xerox price per share, and it's
corrected for splits and

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:40.850
other special factors,
from 1977 to 2001.

01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:46.180
And you can see the incredible
crash they took after digital

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.530
copying came in.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:51.210
In the 1990's, they
were soaring.

01:10:51.210 --> 01:10:52.870
They looked great.

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:56.120
They must have been doing
something right, but they had

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:57.800
their heyday and it's over.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.850
So, Anne Mulcahy came in when
the company was utterly

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:03.615
collapsing, and I guess
she's a success.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:11.510
But it's not its former self,
it's limping along.

01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:16.190
I wanted to tell you now
about Microsoft.

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:19.270
So, that was founded
in 1975 by two

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:21.010
people your age, I guess.

01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:31.470
As of 2000, it had assets
totaling $52 billion, and in

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:34.060
the last ten years, it's almost
doubled it, so its

01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.450
assets are $92 billion.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:39.490
What does it own?

01:11:39.490 --> 01:11:43.630
Well, it has cash of about
$4 billion or $5 billion.

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:48.155
Short-term investments, a lot of
short-term investments, $37

01:11:48.155 --> 01:11:50.780
billion of short-term
investments.

01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:54.320
This is a company that's
doing well.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:58.430
It's not on the end
of its life.

01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:59.770
And it has property.

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:04.920
They have this nice campus
in Redmond, Washington.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.820
They call it a ''campus.''
It's fun.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.070
Fun place.

01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.860
Anyway, it's not
that expensive.

01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.820
All of their real estate now is
only about $8 billion, and

01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:22.070
that's all of their computers
and equipment.

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:26.450
And then, they own stock.

01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:28.140
This is really different
from Xerox.

01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:29.510
Xerox doesn't own any stock.

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.630
They're trying to limp by.

01:12:31.630 --> 01:12:33.350
They're trying to get
back in stride.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.400
Maybe they have gotten
back in stride.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.980
But they've got $10 billion
in the stock market, other

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.440
companies they own.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.030
They own all sorts of stuff.

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:45.260
This is a company that didn't
pay a dividend until recently.

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:50.130
And Bill Gates and Paul Allen
were still there running it.

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.340
Maybe there's a little
bit of truth in this

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:53.320
Pecking Order Model.

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.740
They just wanted to save their
own money and they thought

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.450
their shareholders
would understand.

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:00.790
Microsoft is doing so well.

01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:03.220
Are you really expecting us
to pay you a dividend out?

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:05.740
We have all of these
opportunities, so

01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.330
we'll keep the money.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:13.470
And people had enough faith in
these guys to let them do it.

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.815
So, by this account, the total
assets to the company were $92

01:13:16.815 --> 01:13:19.570
billion, but we have to
look at liabilities.

01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:22.390
Remember, the shareholders'
equity subtracts off

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:24.550
liabilities.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:30.810
So, here are their
liabilities.

01:13:30.810 --> 01:13:35.890
They have some income taxes that
have to be paid, but it's

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:36.800
only $1 billion.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.880
That's like small
change, right?

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.260
It's because of some
timing effects.

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.790
Accounts payable, this is some
money that they owe.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:50.000
They do owe money, because every
company delays paying

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.890
their bills for a little
while anyway.

01:13:51.890 --> 01:13:53.150
So they had something.

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:54.400
Unearned revenue.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:05.710
Typical case is, they've
sold a Windows system.

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:07.380
They've got the money, but they
really haven't completely

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.860
earned it yet, because you're
going to be calling up with

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.100
complaints and they're going
to have to do things in the

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:16.270
future for the revenue that
they've already earned.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:18.480
So, they count that
as a liability.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.950
They didn't have any
debt in 2000.

01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:22.540
This is strange, right?

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:24.380
You think they were making
so much money,

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.990
why should they borrow?

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:30.010
For some reason, it's now
up to about $10 billion.

01:14:30.010 --> 01:14:32.460
I can't explain that.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.585
And so, you add all these up
and subtract them from $92

01:14:35.585 --> 01:14:38.010
billion and their shareholders'

01:14:38.010 --> 01:14:42.300
equity is $48 billion.

01:14:42.300 --> 01:14:44.090
So, they're doing pretty well.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.300
They're much bigger.

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:48.380
But is that the way to
measure Microsoft?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.250
This is a measure
of the value.

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:52.990
It's really the liquidation
value of Microsoft.

01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:59.360
So, you could imagine buying
Microsoft and then selling all

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:02.820
those assets, shutting it
down, firing everybody.

01:15:02.820 --> 01:15:05.140
Would that be a smart
thing to do?

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:06.380
You fire everybody.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:08.380
You sell the Redmond campus.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.430
You sell all of their
computers.

01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:13.180
And what do you end up
with? $48 billion.

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:18.020
Well, let's compare that with
the market cap of Microsoft.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:24.060
They have 8,497 million shares
outstanding, and the price per

01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:27.750
share at the end of
2010 was $26.

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:30.595
So, the market cap
is $221 billion.

01:15:30.595 --> 01:15:34.880
So, that's over five times their
shareholders equity.

01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.520
That means that they have
some other value.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:40.450
I think I'm running
out of time.

01:15:40.450 --> 01:15:44.640
It's interesting what happens
in the world.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.190
I'll stop with this.

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:51.040
This is the price per
share of Microsoft.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.870
I should disclose.

01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:54.770
I'm now a shareholder.

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:58.920
I wish I were a shareholder
back then.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.160
Nobody believed it.

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.830
This only goes back
to '86, but the

01:16:01.830 --> 01:16:03.220
company maybe was private.

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:04.610
I forget when it went public.

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:05.970
So, we don't have prices
[addition: before '86],

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:07.820
but we have prices in '86.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:13.450
It really had a run until 2000,
and then something broke

01:16:13.450 --> 01:16:15.940
with Microsoft as well.

01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.580
It looks a little bit like
Xerox, doesn't it?

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.710
I think it was the end of
the high tech bubble.

01:16:19.710 --> 01:16:23.430
This was a bubble in
tech prices, and

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:25.430
Microsoft rode the bubble.

01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:27.690
But it's still doing
very well.

01:16:27.690 --> 01:16:29.440
It's just not going up lately.

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:30.720
Anyway, this is an example.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:34.320
We're going to talk about real
estate, the other asset class

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.390
that I've mentioned, which is
even bigger than the stock

01:16:36.390 --> 01:16:38.940
market, in our next lecture
on Wednesday.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.075
Professor David Blight:
So what is the engine of

00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:08.550
history?
I beg your attention.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.608
There's a simple question for
you, what is the engine of

00:00:14.608 --> 00:00:18.012
history?
Don't you like unanswerable

00:00:18.012 --> 00:00:21.972
questions?
Is the engine of history

00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:28.018
politics, the inherent,
natural, eternal quest of

00:00:28.018 --> 00:00:34.820
people to bend other people's
wills and take power?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.707
Or is the engine of history
economics, the grinding,

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:45.266
on-the-ground process by which
people carve out livelihoods

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:50.154
over against other people's
competition for the same

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:55.114
livelihoods?
It doesn't seem to matter what

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:58.995
history you study,
or where you look,

00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:04.709
history always somehow comes
around to this nexus,

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.580
this collision,
between forces of political

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.421
power and forces of economics,
and our job is always somehow

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.640
to discern between them and how
they mix.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.775
Now often, of course,
the answer is that it's all one

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:31.170
and the same thing.
Listen to this passage by a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.780
freedman in the South named
Bailey Wyatt.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.550
He got up and made a speech at
a freedmen's political meeting.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.299
This was actually an early
Union League meeting,

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.341
in 1866.
It was about political

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:53.044
organizing in the South.
But know what Bailey gets up

00:01:53.044 --> 00:01:57.714
and says, as it was recorded.
It was a meeting in Yorktown,

00:01:57.714 --> 00:01:59.520
Virginia.
Bailey Wyatt,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.843
former slave,
he's sort of announcing the

00:02:02.843 --> 00:02:07.329
freed people's grievances at a
political gathering.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.661
He says: "We now as a people
desires to be elevated,

00:02:11.661 --> 00:02:15.568
and we desires to do all we can
to be educated,

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:20.069
and we hope our friends will
aid us all they can.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.391
I may state to all our friends
and to all our enemies that we

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:29.560
has a right to the land where we
are located.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.430
Why?
I'll tell you.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.361
Our wives, our children,
our husbands,

00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:39.876
has been sold over and over
again to purchase the lands we

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:44.309
now locates upon.
For that reason we have a

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:48.778
divine right to the land.
And then didn't we clear the

00:02:48.778 --> 00:02:51.786
lands and raise the crops of
corn and of cotton and of

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:54.849
tobacco and of rice and of sugar
and of everything?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.698
And then didn't them large
cities in the North grow up on

00:02:58.698 --> 00:03:02.409
the cotton and the sugars and
the rice that we made?

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.472
Yes, I appeal to the South and
to the North,

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:10.629
if I hasn't spoken the words of
the truth.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.990
I say they have grown rich,
and my people are poor."

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.706
At a political rally,
he makes an aggressive economic

00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:29.789
speech about the labor theory of
value.

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.509
He didn't need to read to John
Locke.

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:35.020
He'd never read Second
Treatise on Government.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.698
He hadn't had a political
philosophy course,

00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:43.411
but he absolutely understood.
He called it the divine

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:46.460
right--the labor theory of
value.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.379
If I labor to improve that
land, it's mine.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.876
In that, in the simplicity,
in the agony and the beauty of

00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:03.309
Bailey Wyatt's statement,
you have a lot of what was at

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:08.480
stake in Reconstruction,
and you have a lot about what

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.934
the political dilemma was,
in delivering on Bailey Wyatt's

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:19.259
claim to a divine right to the
land.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:24.009
All right, back to Washington,
back to the politics,

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:28.828
at least for a few minutes,
and then I want to shift us

00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:32.907
south to this story of the
on-the-ground economics of

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:36.192
Reconstruction,
especially this massive

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:41.157
transformation of a slave labor
economy into some kind of free

00:04:41.157 --> 00:04:44.250
labor economy that quickly
evolves,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.749
of course--and you know this,
at least the contours of it,

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:50.449
from reading Foner--it evolves
eventually,

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:54.219
rather quickly,
into a system of tenant farming

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.891
and a system of sharecropping
and a system ultimately of a

00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:02.335
kind of debt peonage.
But in Washington,

00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:06.677
the political triumph of the
Radical Republicans comes in

00:05:06.677 --> 00:05:11.252
that veto-proof Congress they
produced in the fall elections

00:05:11.252 --> 00:05:15.817
of 1866.
And in 1867 they passed the

00:05:15.817 --> 00:05:21.747
First Reconstruction Act,
followed after that,

00:05:21.747 --> 00:05:26.304
in '67 and early '68,
by three more Reconstruction

00:05:26.304 --> 00:05:28.694
Acts, simply called the Second,
Third, and Fourth

00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:32.075
Reconstruction Acts.
And it was this system by which

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:35.393
the southern states,
the ex-Confederate states,

00:05:35.393 --> 00:05:38.350
were actually readmitted to the
Union.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.798
The great possibilities--Foner
addresses over and over--in this

00:05:44.798 --> 00:05:50.087
experiment in racial democracy,
this experiment in increasing

00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:54.060
democratic forms of government
and institutions in the South,

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.848
through the transplanting of
the Republican Party into those

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:01.889
ex-Confederate states,
is rooted in this document.

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.501
Those are the five--I don't
know if you can read it in the

00:06:04.501 --> 00:06:07.932
back, can read that in the back?
Yeah, all right,

00:06:07.932 --> 00:06:13.079
I love this machine,
it makes me look good.

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.367
But those are the five--I'm not
going to, well,

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:18.812
maybe I will.
The first part of the First

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:21.558
Reconstruction Act divided the
South into five military

00:06:21.558 --> 00:06:23.732
districts.
The Second said that each

00:06:23.732 --> 00:06:27.483
district would be commanded by a
General, not below the rank of

00:06:27.483 --> 00:06:30.689
Brigadier-General,
and an adequate military force.

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:35.901
That part will never really
come off, and it wasn't even

00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:38.228
begun.
The Third, the Commanding

00:06:38.228 --> 00:06:41.868
General would supervise--a
General would supervise election

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:44.190
of delegates to state
conventions,

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.598
and those new state conventions
would write these new state

00:06:47.598 --> 00:06:49.950
constitutions for the Southern
states.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.583
Note the process now.
This is not Lincoln's Ten

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:54.672
Percent Plan,
and it sure as hell isn't

00:06:54.672 --> 00:06:57.640
Andrew Johnson's "that portion
who are loyal" plan.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.770
All adult males,
regardless of color,

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.009
who were not disfranchised for
participation in the war,

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:11.146
were eligible to vote,
and the constitutions had to

00:07:11.146 --> 00:07:16.610
provide for male Negro suffrage,
in the South.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.825
You'll note,
the Republicans,

00:07:18.825 --> 00:07:22.543
as I've said before,
are stepping clear of black

00:07:22.543 --> 00:07:25.657
suffrage in the North,
and they're going to do it

00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:27.040
again in the Fifteenth
Amendment;

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.009
we'll come back to that
Thursday.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.017
And finally,
when a majority of the voters

00:07:33.017 --> 00:07:36.685
ratified a constitution,
and when Congress approved

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:40.500
it--the President has virtually
no role in this,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.680
this is Congressional
Reconstruction;

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.009
when a state had ratified the
Fourteenth Amendment,

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.740
no choice, the equal protection
clause,

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:56.270
the citizenship amendment--you
must accept, then and only then,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.800
a state would be readmitted to
the Union.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.296
If you put it all in one large
pill, it's a very big pill for

00:08:05.296 --> 00:08:08.220
the ex-Confederate states to
swallow,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.003
and at least politically,
on the surface,

00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:14.621
it is exactly what they had to
swallow in order to be

00:08:14.621 --> 00:08:18.831
readmitted to the Union.
And between 1866--actually

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.353
Tennessee was readmitted before
this act even passed,

00:08:23.353 --> 00:08:26.050
in a shifty,
strange manner;

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.902
it had to be readmitted again
after that--but between '66 and

00:08:30.902 --> 00:08:34.623
1870, the eleven former
Confederate states were

00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:39.475
readmitted to the Union under
the Radical Reconstruction Plan

00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:42.629
of the Congressional
Republicans.

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:45.979
Now, those three subsequent
Reconstruction Acts are very

00:08:45.979 --> 00:08:47.570
important.
And by the way,

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.724
every one of these acts,
including the renewal each year

00:08:50.724 --> 00:08:54.196
of the Freedmen's Bureau,
the renewal--I mean,

00:08:54.196 --> 00:08:58.861
the first Civil Rights
Act--fifteen different bills

00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:02.220
developing a Reconstruction
plan,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.299
passed by Congress,
were all vetoed between 1866

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:10.420
and '68 by Andrew Johnson.
I may have said this before,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.742
more vetoes by a president of
the United States than all

00:09:13.742 --> 00:09:16.460
previous American presidents put
together.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.500
You could call this a
constitutional crisis;

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.580
it was.
You could call it a breakdown

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.783
in federalism.
You could call it whatever you

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:25.726
want.
But it's government by veto and

00:09:25.726 --> 00:09:28.435
override of veto.
Every time A.J.

00:09:28.435 --> 00:09:32.673
vetoed a Reconstruction Act,
Congress, in its two-thirds

00:09:32.673 --> 00:09:37.220
majority, Republicans in both
houses, overrode his veto.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:39.861
We've never had a government
operate like this,

00:09:39.861 --> 00:09:42.388
with this many vetoes,
an override of vetoes,

00:09:42.388 --> 00:09:44.799
in such a concentrated period
of time.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:48.323
That's how Reconstruction was
actually put in place

00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:50.737
politically.
The Second Reconstruction Act

00:09:50.737 --> 00:09:53.199
gave details for how those
military commanders were

00:09:53.199 --> 00:09:55.120
supposed to conduct their
districts.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.932
The Third Reconstruction Act,
passed summer of '67,

00:09:58.932 --> 00:10:02.440
set up what were called
registration boards,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:06.757
which were empowered to deny
voting rights to anyone they

00:10:06.757 --> 00:10:10.690
felt were not taking loyalty
oaths in good faith;

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:13.590
they're still trying to enforce
this loyalty oath.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.846
And the Fourth Reconstruction
Act, not passed until spring of

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:23.576
'68, simply said that a majority
of votes cast would be

00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:28.220
sufficient to put a new
constitution into effect,

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:35.289
not a majority of those
Southerners who had voted in

00:10:35.289 --> 00:10:38.917
1860.
You'll note some erosion there,

00:10:38.917 --> 00:10:42.259
in the radicalism of the
radical plan.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:45.531
There are a lot of reasons for
that, not the least of which is

00:10:45.531 --> 00:10:47.515
they were in the midst,
at that point,

00:10:47.515 --> 00:10:49.659
of trying to impeach Andrew
Johnson.

00:10:49.659 --> 00:10:54.248
Now, I wish I had an entire
lecture--well I do have an

00:10:54.248 --> 00:10:59.010
entire lecture--to give you on
the impeachment of Andrew

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.897
Johnson,
but I'm going to do it quickly,

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:05.414
and I'd be more than happy in
our review session in a couple

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:09.199
of weeks,
or any other time,

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:13.996
to come back to it.
It's the first great model we

00:11:13.996 --> 00:11:16.339
have of the impeachment of a
President, of course,

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:19.529
in our history.
We've had another one, since.

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:24.059
We used to think it would
never, ever, ever happen again

00:11:24.059 --> 00:11:30.043
after the Nixon debacle.
Here I go, I'm straying into my

00:11:30.043 --> 00:11:33.292
tangent.
Believe it or not I was--I'm

00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:37.785
giving away my age here--but I
was a high school teacher the

00:11:37.785 --> 00:11:41.059
year Richard Nixon was almost
impeached,

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:46.491
and I had prepared for months
to teach my students about

00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:50.539
impeachment, and then the SOB
resigned.

00:11:50.539 --> 00:11:53.688
[Laughter]
And it just took all the fun

00:11:53.688 --> 00:11:56.564
out of the early 1970s.
[Laughter]

00:11:56.564 --> 00:11:59.299
But it was a great civics
lesson.

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:04.097
We got that civics lesson over
again because of Bill Clinton's

00:12:04.097 --> 00:12:06.850
affair with a White House
intern,

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.847
and because of what "is" or
"was" or whatever the hell it

00:12:09.847 --> 00:12:12.922
was he said to the Grand Jury.
You need to know a couple of

00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:14.673
things though about the
Constitution,

00:12:14.673 --> 00:12:17.864
if you don't already know it.
There actually are four,

00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:22.019
well five, provisions about
impeachment in the Constitution.

00:12:22.019 --> 00:12:25.181
It's the most awesome power in
the Constitution,

00:12:25.181 --> 00:12:27.737
in some ways,
and it isn't wielded very

00:12:27.737 --> 00:12:30.224
often.
The authority to impeach,

00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:34.000
of course, rests with the House
of Representatives.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.273
It is the House of
Representatives,

00:12:36.273 --> 00:12:39.549
through its judiciary
committee, that investigates

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:43.493
grounds for impeachment of a
president or a cabinet official

00:12:43.493 --> 00:12:46.521
or a Supreme Court justice.
It is the House of

00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:49.169
Representatives that then brings
articles of impeachment,

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:53.373
which in effect are like an
indictment, although they are a

00:12:53.373 --> 00:12:57.142
political indictment and never
intended to be a legal

00:12:57.142 --> 00:12:59.876
indictment.
The third part of the

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:02.541
Constitution,
Article 1, Section 3,

00:13:02.541 --> 00:13:06.775
Clause 6, gives the U.S.
Senate the power to sit as the

00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:10.773
jury, the judicial function of
trying a person under

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:15.298
impeachment charges.
The House charges,

00:13:15.298 --> 00:13:18.950
the Senate judges.
Only the Senate,

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.074
in its collective vote,
can determine guilt or

00:13:22.074 --> 00:13:26.170
innocence, and it takes--they
kept this an awesome power and

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.988
difficult to use--it takes a
two-thirds vote of the U.S.

00:13:29.988 --> 00:13:34.570
Senate to impeach and remove a
president or other official.

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:37.392
And then comes the punishment
clause, Article 1,

00:13:37.392 --> 00:13:39.734
Section 3, Clause 7 of the
Constitution:

00:13:39.734 --> 00:13:42.617
judgment in cases of
impeachment shall not extend

00:13:42.617 --> 00:13:45.139
further than to removal from
office,

00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:48.546
and disqualification to hold
and enjoy any other office of

00:13:48.546 --> 00:13:50.100
honor, trust,
or profit,

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.958
under the United States,
but the party convicted shall

00:13:52.958 --> 00:13:55.710
nevertheless be liable and
subject to indictment,

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:00.279
trial, judgment and punishment
according to law.

00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:05.864
You could still be tried in a
criminal court after you're

00:14:05.864 --> 00:14:10.850
impeached, although we've never
gotten that far.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.519
But the only power the Senate
has is removal.

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:17.440
And that is exactly what the
Radical Republicans are trying

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:22.208
to do to Andrew Johnson,
and that he provokes them to

00:14:22.208 --> 00:14:27.519
do, over and over,
in 1867 and early 1868.

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:30.597
There is one other feature in
the Constitution,

00:14:30.597 --> 00:14:33.942
and that is of course the
President's pardon power:

00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:38.090
the President shall have the
power to pardon in all cases,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:43.266
except impeachment.
Now, I don't--you don't

00:14:43.266 --> 00:14:46.910
remember Gerald Ford's pardon of
Richard Nixon.

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:47.240
I do.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:55.580
Probably cost Gerald Ford
election.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.688
All right, in brief,
what happened in the Johnson

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:02.769
impeachment--and he was
impeached,

00:15:02.769 --> 00:15:07.551
he simply wasn't removed from
office--is what you had is a

00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:12.499
process, through four and five
different--depends on how you

00:15:12.499 --> 00:15:17.029
count them--stages in the
political development of this

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:21.390
crisis of authority and power
over who's going to run

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:25.336
Reconstruction.
Now there are numerous

00:15:25.336 --> 00:15:28.636
theories, historical
interpretations,

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:34.320
about why Johnson was finally
impeached by the Republicans.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.705
It never would have happened if
Andrew Johnson would've,

00:15:38.705 --> 00:15:43.489
in any way, just backed off and
admitted that he was probably

00:15:43.489 --> 00:15:46.519
going to be a lame duck
president.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.995
One theory is Johnson's
personal behavior,

00:15:48.995 --> 00:15:51.409
as an explanation for his
impeachment.

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:54.250
His personal habits were hardly
fetching.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:59.249
His Swing Around the Circle in
the fall of 1866 was an utter

00:15:59.249 --> 00:16:04.500
embarrassment to the presidency.
His likening himself to Jesus;

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:11.196
his constant ranting on the
Radical Republicans as traitors,

00:16:11.196 --> 00:16:16.286
calling them Judas.
He is called in the press a

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:21.799
"presidential ass," at various
times during that tour.

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:25.442
That's one part of it,
the sort of personal

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:29.727
provocations of his style.
But a second explanation,

00:16:29.727 --> 00:16:34.111
that I think holds much more
weight, is that Johnson and the

00:16:34.111 --> 00:16:38.049
Radical Republicans simply had
fundamentally different

00:16:38.049 --> 00:16:42.433
constitutional conceptions of
the meaning of the war and the

00:16:42.433 --> 00:16:46.519
meaning and the nature of
Reconstruction policy.

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:48.888
Johnson, you'll remember,
wanted a rapid,

00:16:48.888 --> 00:16:51.730
quick, presidential,
executive Reconstruction,

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.311
with virtually no alteration of
the Constitution and utterly no

00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:59.710
changes in black civil and
political rights.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:04.146
His fifteen vetoes and the
overrides of those vetoes--in

00:17:04.146 --> 00:17:07.049
that process of veto and
override,

00:17:07.049 --> 00:17:11.258
you really have the origins,
the roots, the essence of why

00:17:11.258 --> 00:17:15.761
the Radicals finally decided the
best thing in their political

00:17:15.761 --> 00:17:19.970
interest to do with Andrew
Johnson was to remove him.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.088
A third theory is--and there's
something to this,

00:17:23.088 --> 00:17:26.791
although I don't think it
explains it all by any means--is

00:17:26.791 --> 00:17:30.559
what one historian has called
the radical plot thesis,

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:35.519
just sheer partisan politics,
just sheer partisan hatreds.

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:39.536
This guy was an old Jacksonian
Democrat, he was a southern

00:17:39.536 --> 00:17:42.841
Democrat, as the president,
and the Republicans not only

00:17:42.841 --> 00:17:45.410
wanted him out of the way of
their Reconstruction plans,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.146
they wanted the Democratic
Party ruined,

00:17:48.146 --> 00:17:52.359
if they could do it.
Some of them did want that.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:54.894
Some of the leaders of the
impeachment movement in the

00:17:54.894 --> 00:17:56.759
House--James Ashley,
Benjamin Butler,

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:59.871
George Boutwell and
others--were sometimes referred

00:17:59.871 --> 00:18:02.049
to, even in their friendly
press,

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:06.733
as one Republican paper put it,
"as baleful a trio of buzzards

00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:10.650
as ever perched in the House of
Representatives."

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.216
And they were accused,
as sometimes politicians are

00:18:14.216 --> 00:18:16.569
accused today,
of a witch-hunt.

00:18:16.569 --> 00:18:19.184
They investigated everything
about Johnson,

00:18:19.184 --> 00:18:22.109
his bank accounts,
allegations that he had tried

00:18:22.109 --> 00:18:25.284
to betray Tennessee during the
Civil War--which were

00:18:25.284 --> 00:18:28.832
nonsense--and even that he had
somehow participated in the

00:18:28.832 --> 00:18:32.380
Booth conspiracy to kill
Lincoln--utter nonsense.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.002
The real explanation here,
if there's smoke--I mean if

00:18:37.002 --> 00:18:40.665
there's fire,
where the smoke comes from on

00:18:40.665 --> 00:18:44.589
this radical plot thesis against
Johnson,

00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:48.200
is this idea that there were
some Radical Republicans here

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.513
who saw a big opening,
not only to remake the South,

00:18:51.513 --> 00:18:54.915
to Yankeeize the South--and
they are interested in doing

00:18:54.915 --> 00:18:58.599
that,
and not always of bad motives;

00:18:58.599 --> 00:19:02.059
the South needed schools,
desperately;

00:19:02.059 --> 00:19:05.190
it needed some kind of economic
revival, desperately;

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.109
it needed its harbors dredged
desperately.

00:19:07.109 --> 00:19:09.250
It needed an activist
government to do all of this.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.816
But there were some Radical
Republicans who saw a chance

00:19:12.816 --> 00:19:15.539
here to rearrange constitutional
powers,

00:19:15.539 --> 00:19:19.482
to use the feeling abroad
against Andrew Johnson,

00:19:19.482 --> 00:19:23.589
to tip the balance of power
toward the Congress,

00:19:23.589 --> 00:19:27.742
as never before,
in the nature of the federal

00:19:27.742 --> 00:19:30.296
government.
Removing Johnson would be

00:19:30.296 --> 00:19:33.162
removing an obstacle to
congressional hegemony over the

00:19:33.162 --> 00:19:34.330
federal government.

00:19:39.319 --> 00:19:42.326
And now there's some element
here too, of the fact that you

00:19:42.326 --> 00:19:45.488
need to remember who actually
would've replaced Andrew Johnson

00:19:45.488 --> 00:19:47.510
if he had been removed from
office.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:49.889
There is no vice-president.
He had been Lincoln's

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:52.200
vice-president.
There is no vice-president.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.985
We didn't have the amendment,
which comes later,

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.126
in the twentieth century,
which allows a new president

00:19:58.126 --> 00:20:01.029
who takes over to appoint his
vice-president.

00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:03.545
So in the absence of any
vice-president,

00:20:03.545 --> 00:20:06.957
who would've become president?
Come on, that's a great trivia

00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:08.710
question, use this one out at
the bar.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:14.519
No one will know it.
Louder, I can't hear you.

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:16.029
Students: Speaker of the
House.

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:20.619
Professor David Blight:
No.

00:20:20.619 --> 00:20:25.053
President Pro Tem of the
Senate--bingo--who was Benjamin

00:20:25.053 --> 00:20:30.052
Wade, a Radical Republican from
Ohio, and one of the leaders of

00:20:30.052 --> 00:20:35.099
the impeachment movement;
a little unsavory.

00:20:35.099 --> 00:20:36.460
You're organizing to impeach
the president;

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:40.599
oh by the way,
I'll be the next president.

00:20:40.599 --> 00:20:42.513
And fourth and last,
but not least,

00:20:42.513 --> 00:20:44.934
what's at stake in the
impeachment of Andrew

00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:48.029
Johnson--and I'm going to spare
you all the sordid,

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:51.478
wonderful, tasty,
lovely details of the

00:20:51.478 --> 00:20:57.014
corruption and skullduggery and
scandal and payments that went

00:20:57.014 --> 00:20:59.341
on,
in the final vote in the

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:03.077
Senate, that moved seven
Republicans over to acquittal

00:21:03.077 --> 00:21:08.315
and saved A.J.'s hide.
I'm going to spare you all that

00:21:08.315 --> 00:21:11.789
wonderful, lovely,
corruption.

00:21:11.789 --> 00:21:15.350
It's really beautiful,
awful, ugly stuff.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.060
Money, offices.
If you read John Kennedy's

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:23.215
Profiles in Courage.
We all love to love Jack

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:26.579
Kennedy, and Ted Sorenson,
who was his speech writer,

00:21:26.579 --> 00:21:28.156
was one of the greatest speech
writers ever,

00:21:28.156 --> 00:21:29.440
and Ted Sorenson wrote that
book,

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.133
Profiles in Courage,
then they put Jack Kennedy's

00:21:32.133 --> 00:21:34.542
name on it.
And one of his chapters is,

00:21:34.542 --> 00:21:38.613
of course, about Andrew Johnson
being persecuted by the Radical

00:21:38.613 --> 00:21:45.240
Republicans in Reconstruction.
Blah, God they got that wrong.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.098
But last, but not least,
Andrew Johnson was impeached

00:21:49.098 --> 00:21:52.734
and the Radicals kept going
after him because A.J.

00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:55.431
wouldn't quit;
he kept provoking them,

00:21:55.431 --> 00:21:57.976
provoking them,
provoking them and provoking

00:21:57.976 --> 00:22:01.534
them, and not just with words.
They would appoint a General in

00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:04.380
one of the five districts in the
South, he'd fire him.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:08.402
Congress would appoint a whole
new series of Freedman's Bureau

00:22:08.402 --> 00:22:10.710
agents for Texas,
he'd fire them.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:14.059
You can't run a government like
that.

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:16.230
He would veto the Freedmen's
Bureau, they'd override the

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:18.400
Freedmen's Bureau and they'd put
the budget in place,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.052
and he'd say,
"Just go and try to enforce

00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:24.424
it."
Now what do you do with a

00:22:24.424 --> 00:22:28.875
president, if you're running the
Congress and you're trying to

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:32.632
put a policy in place?
But at the heart here was a

00:22:32.632 --> 00:22:36.711
struggle between a group of
politicians capable of serious

00:22:36.711 --> 00:22:40.650
corruption in their own way,
but nevertheless who were

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.609
actually trying to defeat white
supremacy.

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:47.045
They were actually really
trying to create some kind of

00:22:47.045 --> 00:22:50.099
black civil and political rights
in the South.

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:54.240
Sure, they wanted those blacks
to be Republican voters;

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.537
what else is new?
But Andrew Johnson stood fast

00:22:59.537 --> 00:23:04.642
against them at every turn to
try to preserve his own

00:23:04.642 --> 00:23:08.570
particular vision of white
supremacy.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:12.477
Note just one passage.
In his State of the Union

00:23:12.477 --> 00:23:16.900
Message, December 1867--this is
after three attempts;

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.140
three investigations of him
have already been done by the

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.171
House Judiciary Committee,
and the House Judiciary

00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:26.854
Committee has brought possible
impeachment articles to a vote

00:23:26.854 --> 00:23:30.229
and yet voted it down because
they didn't quite have any

00:23:30.229 --> 00:23:33.473
smoking guns yet.
And what does he do in his

00:23:33.473 --> 00:23:35.877
State of the Union,
December 1867,

00:23:35.877 --> 00:23:39.240
among other things?
He says: "In the progress of

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.762
nations,"--I quote--"Negroes
have shown less capacity for

00:23:42.762 --> 00:23:45.529
government than any other race
of people.

00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:48.779
No independent government of
any form has ever been

00:23:48.779 --> 00:23:53.319
successful in their hands.
Wherever they have been left to

00:23:53.319 --> 00:23:57.178
their own devices,
they have shown a constant

00:23:57.178 --> 00:24:00.600
tendency to relapse into
barbarism."

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:05.694
And it got worse from there.
Stephens, Sumner,

00:24:05.694 --> 00:24:10.967
Wade and the host of the
Republicans in Congress kept

00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:16.748
hearing this over and over and
over, and finally they went

00:24:16.748 --> 00:24:21.371
after him.
The House finally voted in

00:24:21.371 --> 00:24:26.023
February 1868,
by a vote of about 140 to

00:24:26.023 --> 00:24:29.839
50-something,
to impeach him.

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:33.322
The trouble was they
actually--they wrote eleven

00:24:33.322 --> 00:24:37.841
articles of impeachment but in
essence the first nine were all

00:24:37.841 --> 00:24:42.138
about the technical violation of
two laws that Congress had

00:24:42.138 --> 00:24:46.196
passed that ultimately will be,
and should have been,

00:24:46.196 --> 00:24:49.665
declared unconstitutional.
They are called the Tenure of

00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:52.359
Office Act and the Command of
the Army Act.

00:24:52.359 --> 00:24:56.683
The Tenure of Office Act was a
law passed in essence saying the

00:24:56.683 --> 00:25:00.796
President of the United States
could not fire members of his

00:25:00.796 --> 00:25:03.755
own cabinet [laughs].
The Commander of the Army,

00:25:03.755 --> 00:25:05.624
the Act said,
the president of the United

00:25:05.624 --> 00:25:08.811
States as Commander-in-Chief,
cannot issue orders to the

00:25:08.811 --> 00:25:12.519
armies without passing those
orders through the General of

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:15.010
the Army;
which was the nineteenth

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:18.289
century version of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:22.851
They were literally trying to
strip constitutional powers away

00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:26.740
from--not the presidency--but
from Andrew Johnson.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.130
He violated the Tenure of
Office Act, he violated the

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.936
Command of the Army Act,
he willfully did it,

00:25:31.936 --> 00:25:37.193
and that's the grounds on which
they actually impeached him and

00:25:37.193 --> 00:25:40.510
put him on trial.
Now, in the end he was

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.677
acquitted, not just because of
skullduggery,

00:25:43.677 --> 00:25:49.838
corruption, and payments;
not entirely because of that at

00:25:49.838 --> 00:25:51.818
all.
He was acquitted,

00:25:51.818 --> 00:25:55.230
in part, because it was the
spring of 1868.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.838
The Republican Party was about
to hold its nominating

00:25:59.838 --> 00:26:02.940
convention for the 1868
election,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.488
and they were about to
nominate, everybody knew it,

00:26:05.488 --> 00:26:07.680
if they could just convince him
to do it,

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.319
Ulysses Grant as the next
presidential candidate.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:14.953
Grant had been Johnson's
General of the Army and Johnson

00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:18.058
kept embarrassing Grant,
over and over and over,

00:26:18.058 --> 00:26:21.165
until Grant resigned.
And the Republicans were

00:26:21.165 --> 00:26:24.500
suddenly frightened politically
in the spring of 1868,

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.022
if they really removed Johnson
and put Ben Wade in the

00:26:28.022 --> 00:26:31.809
presidency and just literally
took over the government,

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:35.159
that it might really hurt them
at the polls,

00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:38.201
in the fall.
And that Democratic Party was

00:26:38.201 --> 00:26:42.104
doing everything under the sun,
including using the Ku Klux

00:26:42.104 --> 00:26:46.233
Klan to a tremendous extent,
as we'll see in the next two

00:26:46.233 --> 00:26:50.029
weeks, to revive itself and
oppose the Republicans in

00:26:50.029 --> 00:26:54.632
election after election;
and will they ever in that '68

00:26:54.632 --> 00:26:57.974
election.
In the spring of '68 good old

00:26:57.974 --> 00:27:00.950
A.J.
promised better behavior too.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.599
He said he'd cool it,
he'd back off,

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:07.840
he'd get out of the way,
and he would never run again;

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.954
which wasn't quite true.
He was acquitted,

00:27:11.954 --> 00:27:15.917
he served out his term.
He went home to East Tennessee

00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:20.246
and did as old Andy Johnson
always had, he got back on the

00:27:20.246 --> 00:27:23.738
stump and he got himself
re-elected to the U.S.

00:27:23.738 --> 00:27:26.460
Senate.
He will die in 1875.

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.353
He's buried in Greenville,
Tennessee, to this day,

00:27:29.353 --> 00:27:32.838
and we're told he was buried
with a copy of the Constitution

00:27:32.838 --> 00:27:35.259
on his chest,
held down by his hands.

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:37.809
He used to say he stood on the
Constitution;

00:27:37.809 --> 00:27:42.158
he's buried with the
Constitution I guess standing on

00:27:42.158 --> 00:27:45.956
him.
Goodbye Andrew Johnson,

00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:53.575
it's been so good to know you.
Now, that fall the American

00:27:53.575 --> 00:27:58.750
people had a pivotal
presidential election.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.172
I know we say that about all
great elections,

00:28:01.172 --> 00:28:03.980
but let me give you the quick
and dirty, on 1868.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:10.839
Foner covers this nicely.
Grant was a war hero, of course.

00:28:10.839 --> 00:28:14.420
He was going to be now the
candidate of harmony.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.313
We've had a lot of generals in
our history run for president as

00:28:18.313 --> 00:28:21.947
candidates of harmony.
When informed of his

00:28:21.947 --> 00:28:28.970
nomination, which was only a few
weeks after the acquittal trial,

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:32.047
in the Senate,
of Andrew Johnson,

00:28:32.047 --> 00:28:36.759
when informed on May 20,1868 of
his--excuse me,

00:28:36.759 --> 00:28:40.890
in early June,
1868 of his nomination,

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:47.142
he issued a public statement
which read: "I shall have no

00:28:47.142 --> 00:28:54.509
policy of my own to interfere
against the will of the people."

00:28:54.509 --> 00:28:58.460
And I'm going to repeat that,
you tell me what it means.

00:28:58.460 --> 00:29:03.546
"I shall have no policy of my
own to interfere against the

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:08.684
will of the people."
I will not take a stand,

00:29:08.684 --> 00:29:13.245
he said, in effect.
He didn't exactly mean that,

00:29:13.245 --> 00:29:17.212
but the slogan--and he ended
that statement with the famous

00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:21.590
slogan that would become the
slogan of his election campaign,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:25.933
"Let us have peace."
This splendidly ambiguous

00:29:25.933 --> 00:29:30.223
slogan, "Let us have peace."
And God knows the whole

00:29:30.223 --> 00:29:33.544
country's yearning for peace,
but what they would have in

00:29:33.544 --> 00:29:38.128
1868 is by far the most racist,
white supremacist election in

00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:41.848
American history,
and by far, to that date,

00:29:41.848 --> 00:29:44.904
the most violent.
Grant had committed to

00:29:44.904 --> 00:29:47.766
congressional control of
Reconstruction and to the

00:29:47.766 --> 00:29:51.698
Reconstruction Acts.
But the party platform in '68

00:29:51.698 --> 00:29:56.695
now retrenched into being a
political persuasion of order

00:29:56.695 --> 00:30:02.049
and stability and no longer of
revolution and experiment.

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:06.515
They would now be protectors of
the status quo they had created,

00:30:06.515 --> 00:30:10.130
rather than the innovators and
the experimenters.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.016
They were now pilloried by
their opponents,

00:30:14.016 --> 00:30:16.422
the Democrats,
as radicals,

00:30:16.422 --> 00:30:20.680
as amalgamationists,
as miscegenationists.

00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:24.434
Black suffrage,
the right to vote for black men

00:30:24.434 --> 00:30:27.700
became the issue of the 1868
election.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.695
If you think the Democratic
Party in the 1960s under LBJ,

00:30:31.695 --> 00:30:35.119
which passes the '64 and '65
Civil Rights Act,

00:30:35.119 --> 00:30:40.385
put itself on a course of near
destruction in the South because

00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:44.206
of its liberal racial
views--which it did--the

00:30:44.206 --> 00:30:48.792
Republicans of 1868 are now
running as the party of the

00:30:48.792 --> 00:30:51.510
black man's right to vote.

00:31:01.299 --> 00:31:06.545
Now they did say that they were
going to leave the right to vote

00:31:06.545 --> 00:31:10.148
to the whims of the states,
in the North,

00:31:10.148 --> 00:31:14.173
but in the South,
in that Reconstruction Act,

00:31:14.173 --> 00:31:18.380
and by swallowing the
Fourteenth Amendment,

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.730
the black man's right to vote
was supposed to be sacrosanct.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:25.650
The Democratic Party had its
convention in July of '68.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:30.259
It nominated Horatio Seymour of
New York, its former governor.

00:31:30.259 --> 00:31:32.728
Now Seymour had,
among other things--the

00:31:32.728 --> 00:31:36.272
Democrat's candidate for
president--the vice-presidential

00:31:36.272 --> 00:31:39.564
candidate gets worse--but the
Democrat's presidential

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:43.456
candidate in '68,
Seymour, had openly supported

00:31:43.456 --> 00:31:48.077
the draft rioters in 1863 in New
York City, who were out

00:31:48.077 --> 00:31:51.269
slaughtering people in the
streets.

00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:54.204
He was on record for having
opposed the Civil War,

00:31:54.204 --> 00:31:56.299
for having been a Peace
Democrat,

00:31:56.299 --> 00:31:59.377
a McClellan supporter,
a man who would've sued for

00:31:59.377 --> 00:32:02.392
peace with the South,
and he chose as his running

00:32:02.392 --> 00:32:05.918
mate Francis "Frank" Blair,
for vice-president,

00:32:05.918 --> 00:32:09.573
from Missouri,
who was not only an open white

00:32:09.573 --> 00:32:12.749
supremacist,
but he declared that the

00:32:12.749 --> 00:32:15.965
Democrats would,
if elected, announce the

00:32:15.965 --> 00:32:18.940
Reconstruction Acts null and
void,

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.580
they would repeal them,
and they would return the South

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.190
as immediately as possible to
home rule.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.238
In other words,
if the Democrats were elected

00:32:31.238 --> 00:32:35.930
in '68 they would crush the
Reconstruction plans.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:44.428
And Blair, in his blustery
ways, even threatened a second

00:32:44.428 --> 00:32:50.269
civil war;
a little stupid there.

00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:54.894
There were rhetoric and reality
in '68, but what was at stake in

00:32:54.894 --> 00:32:57.829
'68 were the results of the
Civil War.

00:32:57.829 --> 00:33:02.859
It was a memory-laden peace
that was at stake.

00:33:02.859 --> 00:33:06.519
The Democrats wanted to take
the Constitution backward.

00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:09.106
The New York Herald,
a Democratic paper,

00:33:09.106 --> 00:33:11.523
asked, quote,
"Was it the Constitution as it

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:13.660
was or the Constitution as it
is?"

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:22.162
That's Andrew Johnson's slogan.
Now I want to just give you an

00:33:22.162 --> 00:33:28.633
example or two of just how
racist this campaign was in

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.585
1868.
There were bloody shirts waving

00:33:31.585 --> 00:33:33.900
everywhere.
"Your people killed my people."

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.049
"The blood on your hands is the
blood of my son."

00:33:37.049 --> 00:33:39.925
There were Southern bloody
shirts, Northern bloody shirts,

00:33:39.925 --> 00:33:43.778
Democratic Party bloody shirts,
Republican Party bloody shirts,

00:33:43.778 --> 00:33:46.319
and African-American bloody
shirts;

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:49.035
symbolically,
and in some cases literally,

00:33:49.035 --> 00:33:51.964
people would hold them up.
Here's Blair,

00:33:51.964 --> 00:33:54.774
the vice-president,
the attack dog,

00:33:54.774 --> 00:33:58.469
on the campaign trail.
Republicans had oppressed the

00:33:58.469 --> 00:34:01.729
South, claimed Blair in one
speech, by subjecting it to the

00:34:01.729 --> 00:34:05.200
rule of a,
quote, "semi-barbarous race of

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:10.682
blacks who are polygamist and
destined to subject white women

00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:15.315
to their unbridled lust."
"Let White Men Rule America,"

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:18.679
screamed a headline in a
Louisville newspaper,

00:34:18.679 --> 00:34:22.401
arguing that Republicans
preferred, quote,

00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:25.670
"native negroes to native
whites."

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:30.334
And everywhere Democrats
labeled the Republican Party as

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.199
the party of,
quote,

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:40.315
"the amalgamation of the races,
the monstrous negro equality

00:34:40.315 --> 00:34:45.130
doctrine," and on and on it
went.

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:49.762
A Georgia Democrat,
who got himself elected to the

00:34:49.762 --> 00:34:52.787
U.S.
Senate, named Benjamin Hill,

00:34:52.787 --> 00:34:58.080
said the South was now under
the rule of a foreign power,

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.320
driven by hate and determined
to dishonor an unarmed people.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:08.720
And in language understood
across, you might say,

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.480
all the white class lines in
the South,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:15.695
he announced that if the
Radicals controlled

00:35:15.695 --> 00:35:18.910
Reconstruction,
southern whites would become

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:24.310
America's new slaves.
They were, said Benjamin Hill,

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:28.430
quote, "becoming the new
negroes."

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:34.502
And on and on it went.
Now, the Republicans gave it

00:35:34.502 --> 00:35:38.904
back, not quite in kind,
but they certainly waved their

00:35:38.904 --> 00:35:41.778
bloody shirts.
Here's Wendell Phillips,

00:35:41.778 --> 00:35:44.693
the old abolitionist in Boston,
who said, quote,

00:35:44.693 --> 00:35:47.483
in this election,
"We have just finished a war

00:35:47.483 --> 00:35:50.900
between two ideas.
We sent our armies into South

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:55.122
Carolina to carry our ideas.
If we had no right to carry our

00:35:55.122 --> 00:35:58.219
ideas, we had no right to send
our armies.

00:35:58.219 --> 00:36:02.864
If the Democrats"--no,
he said, "If Seymour wins this

00:36:02.864 --> 00:36:07.420
election it is as if Lee
triumphs at Appomattox."

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:13.099
And that makes it pretty clear.
Or take this example of a kind

00:36:13.099 --> 00:36:16.452
of a black bloody shirt.
This is Benjamin Tanner,

00:36:16.452 --> 00:36:18.159
the editor of The Christian
Recorder,

00:36:18.159 --> 00:36:20.699
the largest circulation black
newspaper in the United States.

00:36:20.699 --> 00:36:25.754
It was the weekly newspaper of
the African Methodist Episcopal

00:36:25.754 --> 00:36:29.249
Church.
And he put it into a kind of

00:36:29.249 --> 00:36:32.684
little parable.
And he says what's at stake in

00:36:32.684 --> 00:36:36.289
the '68 election--this is very
gendered of course--when you

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:39.459
think about the power and
significance of black male

00:36:39.459 --> 00:36:42.630
suffrage you know exactly what
he's aiming at.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:47.750
He says Negro manhood is what
is at stake in '68.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:51.754
Here's the way he put it.
"Negro manhood says 'I am an

00:36:51.754 --> 00:36:55.468
American citizen.'
Modern Democracy," meaning the

00:36:55.468 --> 00:36:57.909
Democratic Party,
"says 'you are not.'

00:36:57.909 --> 00:37:00.533
Negro manhood says 'I demand
all my rights,

00:37:00.533 --> 00:37:03.999
civil and political.'
Modern Democracy says 'you have

00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:07.010
no rights, except what I choose
to give you.'

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.708
Negro manhood says 'I must
build churches for myself and

00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:15.215
schoolhouses for my children.'
Modern Democracy says 'if you

00:37:15.215 --> 00:37:19.534
do, I will burn them down.'
Negro manhood says 'I will

00:37:19.534 --> 00:37:26.080
exercise the rights vouchsafed.'
Modern Democracy says 'if you

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.685
do I will mob and murder you.'"
Now, you think our political

00:37:32.685 --> 00:37:38.921
campaigns get ugly.
God, we are so tame,

00:37:38.921 --> 00:37:45.317
compared to this.
As someone once said,

00:37:45.317 --> 00:37:51.470
politics, it's just war by
other means, and there's never a

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:55.820
time when that is more true than
1868.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.900
The Ku Klux Klan came into its
own in 1868.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:05.026
I'm going to lecture in full
about violence and the Klan come

00:38:05.026 --> 00:38:10.728
next Thursday and next week.
But 1868 was their first real

00:38:10.728 --> 00:38:14.142
coming out.
There was a reign of terror in

00:38:14.142 --> 00:38:17.548
five or six southern states in
this election,

00:38:17.548 --> 00:38:20.799
especially in Louisiana,
Georgia, Arkansas,

00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:23.942
and Tennessee.
All across the South,

00:38:23.942 --> 00:38:27.684
in '67 and especially that
election year of '68,

00:38:27.684 --> 00:38:31.904
as blacks are beginning to
evolve into this process of

00:38:31.904 --> 00:38:34.929
tenant farming and
sharecropping,

00:38:34.929 --> 00:38:39.080
and trying somehow to eke out
livings, they went to the polls

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.540
in extraordinary numbers and
risked their lives,

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:47.006
and many of them died doing it.
There were all kinds of

00:38:47.006 --> 00:38:51.813
auxiliaries of the Democratic
Party that really were the Ku

00:38:51.813 --> 00:38:56.047
Klux Klan or its imitators.
There were more than 200

00:38:56.047 --> 00:38:59.543
political murders in the State
of Arkansas alone,

00:38:59.543 --> 00:39:03.036
in this election.
The death toll in Georgia was

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:07.039
lower, but intimidation at the
polls was very effective.

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:12.610
In twenty-two Georgia counties,
with a total of 9,300 black men

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:17.821
listed on the voting rolls,
Grant tallied only eighty-seven

00:39:17.821 --> 00:39:20.600
votes.
Student: Professor

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:25.190
Blight, the students of Civil
War have suffered long enough.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:27.410
Let my people go!

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.520
Professor David Blight:
You're free to leave.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:37.040
[Laughter] Nice hair.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.320
I hope he doesn't have a gun.

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:10.280
[Laughter]
At least he could've sung the

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:10.510
lyric.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.780
Seriously, has that guy left?

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.130
And the suffering continues.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.248
[Laughter]
In Louisiana,

00:40:36.248 --> 00:40:39.750
more than 1000 people died in
political violence,

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.879
in this one election year,
almost all of them black,

00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:49.230
all between April and November
1868.

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:53.223
In Louisiana,
twenty-one parishes that had

00:40:53.223 --> 00:40:59.164
previously had a Republican vote
in 1867, totaling some 28,000

00:40:59.164 --> 00:41:03.840
black voters,
only 501 black votes got cast.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.982
And these are just some
examples of how intimidation

00:41:08.982 --> 00:41:12.293
worked.
Grant carried all of the North

00:41:12.293 --> 00:41:16.458
in '68, except three states,
if you count Oregon as a

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:19.593
northern state.
The only northern states that

00:41:19.593 --> 00:41:22.862
Seymour and the Democrats
carried were New Jersey and New

00:41:22.862 --> 00:41:25.772
York.
Seymour won three border

00:41:25.772 --> 00:41:29.742
states, Delaware,
Maryland and Kentucky,

00:41:29.742 --> 00:41:34.730
and he won only two of the nine
reconstructed,

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:39.918
ex-Confederate states--eight,
excuse me--that were already

00:41:39.918 --> 00:41:44.383
readmitted by 1868.
Grant won in the electoral

00:41:44.383 --> 00:41:48.412
college 214 to 80.
The important thing is--two

00:41:48.412 --> 00:41:52.736
things--the Republicans
sustained in the fall elections

00:41:52.736 --> 00:41:55.860
of 1868 a clear veto-proof
Congress;

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.590
two-thirds in the House and
four-fifths in the Senate.

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:05.117
And without the approximately
half million African-American

00:42:05.117 --> 00:42:10.550
men who voted for Grant in those
ex-Confederate states,

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:13.110
Grant would never have been
elected.

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:18.139
It was the first time in
American history when the black

00:42:18.139 --> 00:42:20.699
vote mattered,
it counted;

00:42:20.699 --> 00:42:25.635
and so many of them voted in
the face of threats to their

00:42:25.635 --> 00:42:28.746
lives.
Now, on the ground in the

00:42:28.746 --> 00:42:34.039
South, in the midst of all this
politics and violence,

00:42:34.039 --> 00:42:44.097
which we'll hear more about in
time, a new level of--did he say

00:42:44.097 --> 00:42:50.930
suffering?--went in place.
There was a speech made by a

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:55.594
former Confederate General at
the American Cotton Planters

00:42:55.594 --> 00:42:58.540
Association meeting in late
1865;

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.793
December '65 to be exact.
And at that meeting--

00:43:02.793 --> 00:43:06.254
ironically it isn't exactly
clear what he intended-- but at

00:43:06.254 --> 00:43:09.059
this meeting the former
Confederate General,

00:43:09.059 --> 00:43:12.609
whose name was Robert
Richardson, said,

00:43:12.609 --> 00:43:18.307
quote, "The emancipated slaves
own nothing because nothing but

00:43:18.307 --> 00:43:24.172
freedom has been given to them."
They own nothing because

00:43:24.172 --> 00:43:28.239
nothing but freedom was given to
them.

00:43:28.239 --> 00:43:33.278
In the absence of slavery what
did the freedmen--now think with

00:43:33.278 --> 00:43:36.610
me--what did the freedmen
actually own?

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:41.650
They owned their bodies and
they owned their labor.

00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:44.583
The freed people,
as a mass of people,

00:43:44.583 --> 00:43:49.022
at the end of the Civil War
now--the jubilee has come but

00:43:49.022 --> 00:43:53.707
what do they actually have?
They lacked physical

00:43:53.707 --> 00:43:58.831
capital--money,
land, to some extent tools--and

00:43:58.831 --> 00:44:04.289
they lacked to a certain degree
human capital,

00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:06.941
which means education,
literacy, and certain kinds of

00:44:06.941 --> 00:44:09.888
skills.
Now a lot of slaves came out of

00:44:09.888 --> 00:44:13.260
slavery, of course,
with enormous skills.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.219
Blacks' economic freedom
though, like their political

00:44:18.219 --> 00:44:23.465
freedom, was largely at the
mercy of the regime of white

00:44:23.465 --> 00:44:27.272
society,
or of white supremacy itself,

00:44:27.272 --> 00:44:31.451
however it would survive.
And the primary goal of white

00:44:31.451 --> 00:44:34.108
Southerners, from day one of
Reconstruction,

00:44:34.108 --> 00:44:37.999
all the way through,
was to try to sustain what they

00:44:37.999 --> 00:44:42.780
most needed, what whites most
needed, which was a landless,

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:51.110
dependent, agricultural labor
force that would stay put.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:57.058
They wanted black people to
remain, if not slaves in status,

00:44:57.058 --> 00:45:02.100
landless, dependent and
stationary, as agricultural

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:04.838
workers.
Put another way,

00:45:04.838 --> 00:45:10.760
American freedom for American
slaves brought no freedom dues.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.872
If you learned about indentured
servitude in the past,

00:45:13.872 --> 00:45:17.161
in the eighteenth century,
in all the colonies there were

00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:19.570
always something called freedom
dues.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:24.064
When an indenture ended,
a former indentured servant got

00:45:24.064 --> 00:45:26.924
a suit of clothing,
a piece of cash,

00:45:26.924 --> 00:45:31.450
and usually a piece of land.
It didn't happen.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:36.302
There were attempts at this;
we'll see more about this in

00:45:36.302 --> 00:45:40.529
the coming two weeks.
There was the Freedmen's Bureau

00:45:40.529 --> 00:45:43.570
efforts to redistribute land,
to some extent.

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.290
There was Thaddeus Stephens'
bill in 1867 which would've--it

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.073
didn't pass--but it would've
called for forty acres and fifty

00:45:51.073 --> 00:45:53.663
dollars;
there was no mention of a

00:45:53.663 --> 00:45:57.403
mule--forty acres and fifty
dollars be given to each

00:45:57.403 --> 00:46:01.950
freedmen family by the federal
government across the South;

00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.515
forty acres.
It actually is sometimes

00:46:06.515 --> 00:46:09.250
referred to as the first
reparations bill;

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.644
didn't pass.
There was Frederick Douglass's

00:46:12.644 --> 00:46:15.585
idea, a little bit later,
of a national freedmen's loan

00:46:15.585 --> 00:46:17.882
agency,
a federal loan agency

00:46:17.882 --> 00:46:22.639
subsidized by the federal
government, by taxpayer money,

00:46:22.639 --> 00:46:25.882
to which freedmen would apply
for loans, perhaps three-year

00:46:25.882 --> 00:46:30.269
loans, five-year loans,
low interest loans, to buy land.

00:46:30.269 --> 00:46:33.500
It's the simplest idea in
banking.

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.722
Didn't happen.
What did happen was a fourth

00:46:37.722 --> 00:46:41.489
effort that became known as the
Freedmen's Bank.

00:46:41.489 --> 00:46:46.170
The Freedmen's Bank was
chartered in late 1865.

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:50.543
It lasted eight, nine years.
It died in 1874 with

00:46:50.543 --> 00:46:55.381
obligations to approximately
61,000 depositors,

00:46:55.381 --> 00:47:00.172
all former slaves,
or virtually all former slaves,

00:47:00.172 --> 00:47:04.587
and the bank died on Frederick
Douglass's watch as its

00:47:04.587 --> 00:47:08.172
president,
because it could not make good

00:47:08.172 --> 00:47:13.094
on its payments.
It was a good idea,

00:47:13.094 --> 00:47:19.103
that really wasn't tried.
The Freedmen's Bank,

00:47:19.103 --> 00:47:21.954
by the way, did have some
Congressional support,

00:47:21.954 --> 00:47:24.260
it did have some federal
subsidies,

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:27.700
but never enough to make a go
or make it work.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:33.928
Today we bail out Bear Stearns.
In 1874, the federal government

00:47:33.928 --> 00:47:37.677
and the politics of 1874,
as we'll see,

00:47:37.677 --> 00:47:41.230
just let the Freedmen's Bank
die.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:46.519
Now, let me leave you with this.
I have I think a minute or so.

00:47:46.519 --> 00:47:49.760
We've learned a great deal,
I think, from the First and the

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:52.666
Second Reconstructions in
American history--if we can

00:47:52.666 --> 00:47:55.292
refer to the Civil Rights
Movement as the Second

00:47:55.292 --> 00:47:58.700
Reconstruction--we've learned a
great deal about how political

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.550
liberty can be achieved:
the right to vote,

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.893
right to hold office,
serve on a jury,

00:48:03.893 --> 00:48:06.869
engage in the political
culture, in spite of the

00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:09.909
hostility and the violence and
intimidation.

00:48:09.909 --> 00:48:12.604
We've learned a great deal
about what can be achieved with

00:48:12.604 --> 00:48:16.511
political liberty,
but we've also learned a lot

00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:22.646
about what is often not achieved
in any kind of concomitant

00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:27.221
economic power.
What happens now in the South

00:48:27.221 --> 00:48:32.380
is a rapid process from slave
labor to a whole new set of

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.710
economic arrangements in the
contract realm.

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:42.680
What blacks most wanted to get
away from, to kill off if they

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.860
could, was any old system of
gang labor.

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:50.450
They wanted control over the
labor and lives of their women.

00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:54.772
They wanted out of gang labor.
They wanted plots of land of

00:48:54.772 --> 00:48:57.448
their own.
But they faced essentially

00:48:57.448 --> 00:49:01.739
these three great obstacles.
And I'll leave you with this.

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:05.928
One is that they had inherited
almost nothing from slavery with

00:49:05.928 --> 00:49:10.764
which to buy land.
Two, they lived in an almost

00:49:10.764 --> 00:49:16.486
non-existent credit market.
Long-term loans were simply not

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:20.762
available anywhere;
and show me a farmer anywhere,

00:49:20.762 --> 00:49:25.578
in a capitalist economy,
who can survive without his

00:49:25.578 --> 00:49:28.761
bank loans.
And three, they face an

00:49:28.761 --> 00:49:33.375
enormously hostile regime of
white supremacy that does not

00:49:33.375 --> 00:49:38.070
believe black people should have
economic independence.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:41.224
And initially what we see
happening is that tenant

00:49:41.224 --> 00:49:43.670
farming, and then working on
halves,

00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:48.471
or thirds and then halves,
and working in a sharecropping

00:49:48.471 --> 00:49:53.178
system, becomes a compromise.
It becomes a compromise because

00:49:53.178 --> 00:49:57.144
paying wages to former slaves
doesn't work in an economy that

00:49:57.144 --> 00:50:01.933
is so cash poor.
There's no cash to pay anybody

00:50:01.933 --> 00:50:04.365
with.
So blacks actually begin to

00:50:04.365 --> 00:50:07.049
embrace this idea of being a
tenant farmer,

00:50:07.049 --> 00:50:09.670
because you get your own plot
of land,

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:13.156
you have some control over your
own labor, you plant your seeds,

00:50:13.156 --> 00:50:16.000
you own your own tools,
or you think you do.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.402
At the end of the crop season
you're going to share half of

00:50:19.402 --> 00:50:22.512
that crop with the owner of the
land and then with the

00:50:22.512 --> 00:50:25.611
furnishing merchant,
this new institution that

00:50:25.611 --> 00:50:28.676
evolves.
But you get to keep half,

00:50:28.676 --> 00:50:34.374
and you can at least hope that
in that half comes something

00:50:34.374 --> 00:50:40.042
like cash that you can keep.
What it really is going to

00:50:40.042 --> 00:50:43.472
become, however,
for most, not all,

00:50:43.472 --> 00:50:47.911
is a dead end,
to some extent a dead end kind

00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:51.884
of debt peonage.
What we do know is this:

00:50:51.884 --> 00:50:56.057
over the next twenty to thirty
years, by about 1890 and

00:50:56.057 --> 00:50:59.474
certainly by 1900,
about fifteen to percent

00:50:59.474 --> 00:51:03.960
percent of American freedmen,
and their sons and daughters,

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:11.273
will own their own land.
It means about eight percent to

00:51:11.273 --> 00:51:18.190
eight-five percent did not.
I'll leave you there;

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.190
and suffer on.

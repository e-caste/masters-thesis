00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
(tense music)

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.310
- Greetings everyone.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.540
Thanksgiving is coming,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.670
less students are coming.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.170
Today, we have a wonderful
opportunity to...

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.610
To close the historical part

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.510
of History of Ukraine course,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.470
with guest lecturer, Professor Marci Shore.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.200
She is Assistant Professor...

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.100
Associate Professor of history already

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.090
here at Yale.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.320
Professor Marci Shore
teaches European cultural

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.420
and intellectual history.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
She graduated with a bachelor's
and PhD from Stanford,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.020
and holding master's degree

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.970
from University of Toronto.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.670
She wrote it extensively on

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.310
intellectual history of
Eastern Central Europe.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.370
And recently, she published book

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.000
on history of Euromaidan (indistinct)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.184
was submitted to read,

00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:11.883
"The Ukrainian Night: An
Intimate History of Revolution"

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.330
And today, we'll be particularly talking

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.560
about the years coming to Euromaidan,

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.480
and revolution itself,
and its consequences.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.100
Marci, the floor is yours.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.933
- Oh, thank you.

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:30.420
Thank you, it's nice to see you.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.090
I'm recognizing some of you,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.690
so I think some of you have listened

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780
to me talk before, or taken my classes,

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.573
so hopefully this won't be too repetitive.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.280
Let me start...

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.130
Let me start just briefly with...

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.340
With the fall of communism in 1989,

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.200
'cause this was also reminding me of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.193
when I was younger.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.110
One of the things Maidan
did was bring me back

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.530
to that moment when I
first became enchanted

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.760
with this whole part of the world,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760
with Eastern Europe.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.805
And in 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell,

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:12.376
it was one of those things that felt

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:14.790
inconceivable and impossible

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.710
until the moment that it happened.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.730
And then, in retrospect,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.050
it seemed inevitable,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.190
which I think is a lesson

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.960
for historians in general,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.980
that the thing that seems

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.550
impossible and inconceivable
will seem that way

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.440
until the moment that it happens,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.030
and then it will retrospectively seem

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.770
to be inevitable.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.410
The Soviet Union seemed like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.030
it would go on forever.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.290
The one thing that struck me

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.990
when I first started
going to Eastern Europe

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.070
in the early 1990s was

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.327
how many people said to me,

00:02:43.327 --> 00:02:47.280
"I never thought I would
see it end in my lifetime."

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.540
People who were dissidents,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.800
people who sat in prison,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.880
people who did everything

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.720
they could to protest,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.710
people who did nothing,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.760
people who were content,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.440
people who went along with it;

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.857
Everybody said, "We never thought

00:02:56.857 --> 00:02:59.100
"we would see it end in our lifetime."

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.110
And I know that you've all, by now,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.120
sat through this whole course on Ukraine,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.770
so you know a lot by now about

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.600
the Soviet experience.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.999
So I'll just say, as a reminder,

00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.770
in some sense to myself as well,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.770
that the Soviet project was arguably

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.570
the largest, deepest,

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.730
most far reaching experiment

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.140
in social engineering

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.275
that has ever been performed on mankind.

00:03:28.275 --> 00:03:29.520
And in some sense,

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.590
we are still grappling with

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.710
the sheer scope of the experiment,

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.470
and the sheer magnitude of the failure,

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.943
of the catastrophe.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.050
It was not just an attempt

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.400
to remake a government,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.780
and it wasn't even just an attempt

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.920
to remake a society.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.260
It was an attempt to remake human beings.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.880
It was an attempt to create

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.353
a new kind of human being.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.790
And I was...

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.980
I was the last generation to grow up

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.270
during the Cold War.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.103
The war was...

00:04:01.103 --> 00:04:02.970
the world was divided into two camps.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.672
There was an Iron Curtain,

00:04:04.672 --> 00:04:06.090
not literal,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.500
although in the case of the Berlin Wall,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.170
there was actually physical wall.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.297
The world was divided into those two sides

00:04:12.297 --> 00:04:13.380
and you were never gonna see

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.790
what was on the other side.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.680
Sorry, I'm trying to avoid
moving around too much,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.910
which is my usual practice

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.740
because I see that there's a camera there,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.060
so I'm gonna try to be disciplined

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.083
and stay right here.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.400
And then, one day, it was over

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.290
and the wall fell, and the world opened.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.320
And soon enough afterwards,

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.990
the Soviet Union seemed to dissolve.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.533
Kind of, just dissolve into pieces.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.033
Ukraine, as you probably heard,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.370
got its independence,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.890
to a certain extent, by default,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.180
but also with some agitation,

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.120
and with some desire on the part

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.830
of the population.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.623
And in the West, we were celebrating.

00:04:55.623 --> 00:04:57.067
"The wicked witch is dead

00:04:57.067 --> 00:04:58.920
"and now we all live happily ever after,"

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.300
that was the paradigm.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.920
I always think of the Wizard of Oz,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.450
and "Ding Dong, the witch is dead."

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.567
You've all seen the Wizard of Oz, yes?

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:06.240
"Ding dong, the witch is dead."

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.190
There was a sense that
the wicked witch is dead,

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.400
and now we were all gonna
live happily ever after.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.966
Ironically, or perhaps paradoxically,

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:17.469
the Hegelian narrative that had been

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.600
underlying communism
all these years gave way

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.510
to what was also a Hegelian narrative

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.143
about a liberal teleology of progress,

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:30.480
that now that communism had failed

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.030
and now we knew that, in fact,

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.010
the locomotive of history was leading

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.019
towards liberal democracy.

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:41.045
And there was a sense that
liberalism, democracy,

00:05:41.045 --> 00:05:43.290
free market neoliberalism,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.410
they were all part of, what
Adam Michnik has called,

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.020
the "utopian capitalist package."

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.430
They were going together as part

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.080
of a harmonious whole,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.640
and now, we were all going
to move on that train

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.473
and live happily ever after.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.490
There had been wonderful
existentialist metaphysics

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.650
among dissidents and philosophers

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.570
in the 80s and 90s...

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.770
Or 70s and 80s, especially after 1968.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.780
That kind of disappeared in the 90s

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.990
because everybody was
celebrating the end of history,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.760
as Francis Fukuyama called it,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.460
and the triumph of neoliberalism.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.560
There was something
kind of smug about that.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.230
Our smug Western triumphalism that,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.063
yes, we were right,

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:28.503
now everybody lives happily ever after.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.770
Now, in some sense,

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.420
that was a narrative that,

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.370
on both sides of the Iron Curtain,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.055
was very deeply felt.

00:06:37.055 --> 00:06:40.846
But something we perhaps
didn't appreciate so much,

00:06:40.846 --> 00:06:43.856
being on the former capitalist side,

00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:45.630
or the still capitalist side,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.430
of the Iron Curtain was just

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.140
how brutal the 1990s were

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.080
for the societies that were
coming out of communism.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.890
Nobody really knew how you go

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.710
and undo the communist experiment,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.170
and try to get back on that locomotive.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.110
Nobody really knew how you
made those transitions.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.000
There were lots of theories.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.220
There was shock therapy in Poland.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.680
There was a faith that even if it were...

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.634
However rough it might be,

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:18.300
there were gonna be
some bumps in the road,

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.583
but now we knew where the road was going.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.750
And the 1990s, I mean,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:26.880
not only in the former Soviet space,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.740
perhaps more dramatically in

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.000
the former Soviet space

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.500
than in the rest of Eastern Europe,

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.500
which was also quite rough.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.720
One of my graduate students now,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.690
who's from Albania, said,
there's an expression Albanian,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.768
that's "it's not the 1990s,"

00:07:41.768 --> 00:07:44.820
that references that you're
continually referencing

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.290
the trauma of the 1990s.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.360
It took us a long time, I think,

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.977
in the West to understand that

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:52.320
the 1990s were traumatic.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.090
There was a kind of wildness to it,

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.900
a sense that the old
rules no longer obtained

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.310
and nobody knew what the new rules were.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.880
The coming of capitalism
came as a kind of what,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.000
in American history we've called
"robber baron capitalism."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.730
Capitalism as a wild free-for-all

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:13.590
with no rules.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.330
It left open the possibility

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.420
of former communist apparatchiks

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.880
very quickly transitioning

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:24.390
into gangster-style neoliberals

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.869
who managed to monopolize

00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:30.240
and steal a lot of the state resources.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.330
The transition was not
particularly gentle,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.330
and not necessarily
particularly fair at all.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.603
So Ukraine was languishing
under these conditions,

00:08:39.603 --> 00:08:42.573
as were other places.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.090
It was called...

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.430
The Ukraine of the 1990s was called

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.567
by the American political
scientist, Keith Darden,

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:51.540
"The blackmail state,"

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.105
which was a term that got taken up.

00:08:55.105 --> 00:08:57.720
Was mired in corruption scandals,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.540
you probably heard a bit
from Professor Snyder

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.280
already about Leonid Kravchuk,

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.310
who came through the Communist Party.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.710
And then, his successor, Leonid Kuchma,

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.290
who was entering politics around 1990,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.473
and just mired in corruption scandals.

00:09:13.473 --> 00:09:16.342
This omnipresence of corruption,

00:09:16.342 --> 00:09:20.070
of this lawlessness that is accompanying

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.434
the transition to capitalism.

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:23.880
I mean, I still remember the transition

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.137
to capitalism even in so-called

00:09:26.137 --> 00:09:27.780
"gentle places," like Prague,

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.282
where you just got in a cab

00:09:29.282 --> 00:09:33.210
and they could charge
you any amount of money.

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.010
There was no in there being

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.540
any kind of limitation,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.910
or any kind of commitment to rates

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:39.750
that were pro...

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:40.740
That were posted.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:42.360
I mean, you just felt
constantly vulnerable

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.133
because there were no rules.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.250
In the year...

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.020
In September 2000,

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.750
this era is probably personified,

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:55.505
or symbolized, by a brutal murder,

00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:59.970
an assassination of a
Georgian-Ukrainian journalist...

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.800
Young Georgian-Ukrainian
journalist, Georgiy Gongadze,

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.843
who had been reporting on corruption,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.353
who was assassinated
during Kuchma's reign.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.900
There wasn't widespread violence en masse

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.130
against the population,

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.350
but if you were a dissident journalist

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:22.890
or if you were making
trouble in particular,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.790
then you were clearly very vulnerable.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.620
And Ukraine languished this way

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.040
until the elections of 2004,

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.190
which is really where I
wanna pick up for today.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.440
And the elections of 2004,

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.880
the presidential elections,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.060
were the elections between two Viktors.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.920
My kids are always complaining that

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.060
all of these people we know

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.740
in various Slavic speaking countries,

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.300
their names repeat too much.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.120
There are many Agnieszkas
in Poland and Romania.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.950
There are many Viktors,

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.270
there are many Sashas.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.643
So this is an election
between two Viktors;

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.213
Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Yushchenko.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.197
And Viktor Yanukovych was your

00:11:04.197 --> 00:11:06.840
post-Soviet gangster type.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.710
I mean, not really "type,"

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:09.540
I mean, he was a gangster.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.460
I mean, and not...

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.440
My friend, Ivan Krastev,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.910
the Bulgarian political scientist,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.747
said to me once, "Marci,
it's not just that

00:11:16.747 --> 00:11:17.797
"he's a gangster,

00:11:17.797 --> 00:11:20.220
"he's a petty gangster."

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.907
To which Radek Sikorski answered,

00:11:21.907 --> 00:11:23.377
"the sums of money involved were

00:11:23.377 --> 00:11:24.627
"really not so petty."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.220
Post-Soviet gangster type,

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.720
close to the Kremlin,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.120
representing continuity with

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.280
what had come before.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.290
The presidency would clearly enrich

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:40.020
himself and his circle of friends.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.850
And then, there was Viktor Yushchenko,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:44.370
who seemed to be the person

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.870
who was Westward-looking,

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:48.540
who was looking towards Europe,

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.880
who was going to take Ukraine,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.040
or had visions of taking Ukraine,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.643
on a path towards eventual
European Union integration.

00:11:57.478 --> 00:12:00.720
And the short version of

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.460
this particular story is
that Yanukovych's team tries

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.390
to poison Viktor Yushchenko with dioxin.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.770
Not only tries,

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.163
they do poison use Yushchenko with dioxin.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:16.650
The doctors save him,

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:20.340
but his face is grotesquely disfigured.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.630
And in some ways,

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:23.400
that disfigured face,

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.530
the images of Yushchenko

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:28.080
as a victim of this dioxin poisoning,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.020
becomes the face of those elections,

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.420
and a symbol of the brutality

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:34.443
and the corruption.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.370
Not only do they poison Yushchenko,

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.263
but then they cheat in the elections.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.070
In a way, not so dissimilar

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.580
from the way that Lukashenko, in Belarus,

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.560
cheated in the elections two years ago.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.090
It was quite obvious to people

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.150
that they had forged the election results.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:54.983
And at that point,

00:12:54.983 --> 00:12:57.696
Ukrainians come out onto the streets.

00:12:57.696 --> 00:13:01.680
And in particular, they
come out to the main square

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.260
in the center of Kyiv.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:05.970
And the main square in the center

00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.100
of Kyiv is called the Maidan.

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.859
I just wanna say about the Maidan,

00:13:10.859 --> 00:13:14.850
it's an unusually large city square,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.850
and it's an unusually
complex geographical space.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.450
So for those of you who are interested

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.410
in what is visual,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.690
who are interested in
what is architectural,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:26.910
it's multi-leveled,

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.039
which is not so typical for a city square.

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:32.864
And there's a underground part,

00:13:32.864 --> 00:13:36.450
with a subway and with
some underground shopping.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.612
So it's large and complex,

00:13:38.612 --> 00:13:42.300
and architecturally offers possibilities

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.980
for things to happen on this square.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.930
So for those of you
who haven't been there,

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.300
that physical space is significant

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.260
to the rest of the story

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.700
that I'm going to tell.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.950
And hopefully, you all go some day.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.049
Hopefully, after the victory when

00:13:55.049 --> 00:13:57.156
(speaking foreign language).

00:13:57.156 --> 00:13:57.989
As they say Ukrainian,

00:13:57.989 --> 00:14:00.657
"We can all go back and do
fun things on the Maidan."

00:14:02.169 --> 00:14:04.650
Ukrainians go to the Maidan,

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.470
to the central square in Kyiv,

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:11.580
and they protest in November 2004.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.240
They protest forged elections.

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.230
And Kyiv is very...

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.060
It gets very cold in the winter.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.620
It's fairly far north,

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.420
not as far north as Petersburg,

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.040
but quite far north.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.750
For three weeks, people stand there

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.850
and they freeze and they shout.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.890
It's completely nonviolent,

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.353
but they insist on free elections.

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:37.530
And somewhat miraculously, it works,

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.390
Under pressure to some extent

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.070
from other European countries,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.670
but the elections are done over.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.910
This time, Yushchenko
is declared the winner.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.477
And people are happy and they go home.

00:14:51.477 --> 00:14:53.970
And as you can probably guess,

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:56.845
this is not going to
be happily ever after.

00:14:56.845 --> 00:14:59.280
We're still waiting for
that moment in history

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.540
when happily ever after comes,

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.898
it's never come,

00:15:01.898 --> 00:15:05.707
so we don't want to anticipate too much.

00:15:05.707 --> 00:15:07.030
People go home,

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.347
and there's a sense of,

00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:10.710
"Now, we are on the right path."

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.930
But the short version of this story is

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.200
that Yushchenko turns out
to be a disappointment.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.400
And hopefully, you'll have some time

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.020
to talk in your discussion sections

00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:21.240
in more detail about why he turns out

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.890
to be a disappointment.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.330
Was he never quite the same

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:25.740
after the dioxin poisoning?

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.320
Was he never actually the Messiah figure

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.150
that he was projected to be?

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.060
Was it because of infighting on his team?

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.440
Did it have to do with the falling out

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.687
with the Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko?

00:15:36.687 --> 00:15:39.240
Was he always a little
bit self-interested?

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.970
Did he always have certain
nationalist leanings?

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.450
For overdetermined reasons that will...

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:46.980
We will never be able to know,

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:49.785
with certainty, exactly what was causal.

00:15:49.785 --> 00:15:52.200
It doesn't work out well.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.430
And again, I hope you'll have some time

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.230
to talk about this in
your discussion sessions

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:57.240
'cause it was an interesting moment.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.847
And in the meantime, Yanukovych,

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:01.230
it had seemed absolutely impossible

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.090
that this man could ever come back.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:03.923
I mean, first of all,

00:16:03.923 --> 00:16:05.973
he was hardly very
inspiring to begin with.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.280
He was...

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.700
He had a past that was
a past as a gangster,

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.690
he was involved in robbery,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:13.830
he was involved in assault,

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.417
stealing state resources,

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:17.520
being his usual gangster self.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.410
There's nothing particularly
appealing about him.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.870
I realize I'm being very biased here.

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:26.405
And it was publicly exposed

00:16:26.405 --> 00:16:29.520
that he poisoned his opponent with dioxin

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.480
and cheats in the election,

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.530
so you think, really, he's out of there.

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.370
But somehow, he's still lurking around

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:37.140
in the background,

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.080
and he doesn't give up.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.227
And he finds out that in Washington,

00:16:44.227 --> 00:16:46.560
there are some Americans who have

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.124
a little boutique industry going

00:16:49.124 --> 00:16:53.280
for gangsters with presidential ambitions.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.630
I mean, really, American capitalism,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.743
you can find anything.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:59.340
And so, he decides he's going to hire

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.920
one of these public relations consultants

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.110
who specializes in gangsters

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.613
with presidential ambitions.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.820
And so, this guy,

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:10.860
whose name was Paul Manafort,

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.397
you may have heard of him,

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:16.050
comes over to Ukraine from Washington.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:18.270
He doesn't know Ukrainian,

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.100
he doesn't know Russian,

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.954
but he knows how to play golf.

00:17:21.954 --> 00:17:24.318
He has opinions about suits,

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:26.795
he has opinions about haircuts,

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:31.076
he has opinions about facial
expressions on television,

00:17:31.076 --> 00:17:35.706
and they hang out and he grooms...

00:17:35.706 --> 00:17:38.100
Manafort grooms Yanukovych

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.750
and gives him a makeover.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:41.070
Now, again, I realize I'm not

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:42.960
a very objective source
of information here

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.140
because I find Yanukovych
somewhat repulsive.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.167
I didn't really see the transformation.

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:50.790
Nothing seemed to be

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:52.853
particularly enchanting about him

00:17:52.853 --> 00:17:55.590
after Manafort worked on him.

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.500
But somehow, he comes back

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:03.000
and in 2010, genuinely wins the election.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.033
And this time, nobody
disputes the election results.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.874
And as a thank you gift,

00:18:08.874 --> 00:18:11.118
he presents Paul Manafort

00:18:11.118 --> 00:18:14.283
with a $30,000 jar of black caviar.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.070
I don't even know what one does

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.080
with a $30,000 jar of black caviar

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:20.370
but again, I'm speaking as somebody

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.660
who doesn't like caviar.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.760
So again, for overdetermined reasons,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.060
I'm not impressed by this.

00:18:26.536 --> 00:18:29.160
In any case...

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.570
You can tell I'm not really

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.180
a neutral observer to this story.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:34.140
I'm not Ukrainian,

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:35.880
but I'm also not a neutral observer.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.290
It's hard to maintain your stance

00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.413
as a neutral observer
for a very long time.

00:18:41.672 --> 00:18:43.590
In any case, Yanukovych is the president,

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.890
he's being his usual gangster-like self,

00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:49.110
not particularly inspiring.

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.710
He's not offering anyone
some kind of grand narrative.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.177
I mean, he's not one
of these dictators with

00:18:55.177 --> 00:18:57.570
"I am going to restore you to greatness."

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.370
There's no eschatology,

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:00.720
there's no teleology.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.757
It's just like "the next
gangster could be worse,

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:04.957
"so you better kind of shut up

00:19:04.957 --> 00:19:06.690
"and go along with me."

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:08.640
He's not using widespread violence

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.990
against the population,

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.820
unless you really get in his way,

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.003
and then people could be
eliminated here and there.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.650
And he's dangling out the carrot

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:24.650
of eventually, slowly perhaps, one day,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.940
putting Ukraine on a path

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.893
towards European Union integration.

00:19:31.478 --> 00:19:33.750
And this, for the people,

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.500
especially the people
who are exactly your age,

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.333
was...

00:19:38.333 --> 00:19:39.547
Meant everything.

00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:42.060
Whether or not, if you were...

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.140
If you were 15, or 18, or 22, or 25,

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.730
whether or not Europe was going

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.480
to be open to you meant everything

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.030
about what kind of future you could have.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.010
Would you be able to
learn foreign languages?

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.570
Would you be able to study abroad?

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.790
Would you be eligible
for Erasmus exchanges?

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:03.030
Would you be eligible to
do internships in Brussels?

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.440
Would you be able to travel,

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.520
and go to conferences,

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.170
and meet with other young people

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.020
without spending months
waiting in long lines,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.160
and humiliating yourself,

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.090
and paying lots of money

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.080
and pleading for a visa

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.210
that you might or might not get?

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.920
So this, whether or not the doors

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.420
of Europe would be open,

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.250
was enormously important,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.500
especially to young people,

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:23.850
and especially to students,

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.250
especially to people who
were looking at their future,

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:27.870
who were upwardly mobile,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.790
who wanted to learn languages,

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.233
who wanted to see the world.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.680
In November 2013,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.010
Yanukovych was due to sign this

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:41.310
very long anticipated
association agreement

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.050
with the European Union.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.170
Now, it was not a fantastic agreement,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.390
and I think that the TFs can tell you

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:50.440
more about the details of this agreement.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.390
It would have involved Ukraine undertaking

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.640
costly reforms to get in line

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.310
with European Union regulations.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.960
It almost definitely would
have provoked retaliation

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.793
from the Kremlin,

00:21:04.793 --> 00:21:06.930
who did not want Ukraine associating

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.210
more closely with the European Union.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:10.680
And at the end of the day,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.426
it didn't make any promises

00:21:12.426 --> 00:21:15.210
about European Union membership.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:16.740
This was an association agreement,

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.016
it wasn't a membership agreement.

00:21:19.016 --> 00:21:22.507
But it was a foot in the door.

00:21:22.507 --> 00:21:26.460
It was symbolically of
enormous significance.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:29.627
It was a sign that Ukraine had intentions

00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:34.080
of getting in line with European
standards for integration.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.630
And it was a sign that, potentially,

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:38.430
even if contingently,

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.102
if everything went well,

00:21:40.102 --> 00:21:42.450
Europe was open to the possibility

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.286
of accepting Ukraine.

00:21:44.286 --> 00:21:47.160
And so, for an agreement that,

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:49.260
on the face of it and in the details,

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.270
didn't seem so spectacular,

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:53.310
it was of enormous symbolic

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:55.440
and existential significance,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.903
especially to a certain demographic.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.680
At the 11th hour, when the ceremony had...

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.850
There was a signing ceremony.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.110
It was set up in Vilnius.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.620
Everything was all arranged
for the end of November.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.880
And at the very last minute

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.440
on November 21st,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.407
Yanukovych suddenly said,
"No, I'm not gonna sign."

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.790
And then there was a feeling of

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.820
sudden shock and devastation.

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.790
Again, not equally
throughout the population.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.410
And I keep emphasizing that

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.030
because it's very different from the war

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.740
that's going to come later.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.030
The people who were...

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.610
The part of Ukraine that
was truly devastated

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.627
by the association agreement was

00:22:34.627 --> 00:22:37.650
a more distinct demographic than

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.600
the part of Ukraine devastated by the war,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.850
which is a whole country.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:44.818
At that point, still,

00:22:44.818 --> 00:22:46.710
nothing might have happened.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.543
It's one of the lessons

00:22:47.543 --> 00:22:49.260
about historical contingency.

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.430
People were very depressed,

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.570
people were very upset,

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.713
people were angry.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.140
Had not a 32 year old
Afghan-Ukrainian journalist,

00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.970
named Mustafa Nayyem,

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.320
not posted on Facebook, in Russian,

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.890
a little note on November 21st,

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.901
saying, "Hey, let's be serious.

00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:12.967
"If you're really upset,

00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:16.507
"come out to the Maidan
by midnight tonight."

00:23:16.507 --> 00:23:19.887
And he said, "likes do not count."

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.760
Interestingly, that "likes do not count"

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.880
initially often got
mistranslated to English,

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.170
which I found odd because

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:30.990
it's one of the rare,
serendipitous moments

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:32.400
when the Slavic translates

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.750
perfectly into English.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:36.177
It was literally "likes do not count."

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.370
And as a historian,

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:39.984
that really captured me

00:23:39.984 --> 00:23:41.917
because I thought, "Wow,

00:23:41.917 --> 00:23:43.927
"that's a sentence that would have made

00:23:43.927 --> 00:23:46.350
"no sense before Facebook."

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.183
Like, student...

00:23:47.183 --> 00:23:48.360
I mean, literally, it would've been devoid

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.790
of any semantic meaning before Facebook.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:53.280
And now, "Likes do not
count" is going to become

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.563
a revolutionary slogan
for the 21st century.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.960
People come out to the Maidan that night.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.940
Mostly, although not exclusively,

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.290
young people, students,

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.030
people exactly your age,

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.740
quite similar to yourselves,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.840
they go out to the square.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.550
It's November, it's cold,

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.410
not as cold as it's
going to get in January,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:14.243
but cold.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.640
They hold hands, they sing,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.290
they play music,

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.349
they're completely peaceful.

00:24:21.349 --> 00:24:24.665
They're not interested in ethnic politics,

00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:28.110
they're not interested
in language politics,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.659
they're not interested in
opposition political parties,

00:24:31.659 --> 00:24:34.710
they're not talking about elections.

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:38.370
Their slogan is "Ukraine is Europe."

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.203
That's it.

00:24:39.203 --> 00:24:40.650
"Ukraine is Europe."

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:43.319
And they call themselves "Euromaidan."

00:24:43.319 --> 00:24:45.963
They want Europe to be open to them.

00:24:47.014 --> 00:24:50.167
And there are, at any given time,

00:24:50.167 --> 00:24:52.260
anywhere from several hundred

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:55.320
to a couple thousand
of them on this square.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.770
They stay there for about nine days.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.650
Again, completely peacefully,

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:03.333
hanging out, dancing,

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.467
declaring that "Ukraine is Europe."

00:25:08.957 --> 00:25:12.090
And then, at four in the morning

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.563
on November 30th,

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:16.710
Yanukovych suddenly,

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.030
or not so suddenly,

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:18.900
we don't really know,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.210
I have no privileged
epistemological access

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.610
to what was going on inside his head,

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:25.290
perhaps under pressure from Putin,

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:28.320
he decides to send out his riot police,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.730
called Berkut,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.653
to brutally beat up the students.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:36.270
And this was a shock.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.250
It was a shock because there had been

00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:40.611
a tacit social contract that

00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:43.886
however much corruption there had been,

00:25:43.886 --> 00:25:47.460
however weak the rule of law had been,

00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:51.630
however much that people's livelihoods

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.600
and resources had been stolen from them,

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.360
however a journalist may
have been assassinated

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.250
here or there if they were too critical,

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.980
since 1991, in independent Ukraine,

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:04.440
the regime had not used mass violence

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.619
against its own population.

00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:08.580
And there was a sense that

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.883
that was a line that was
impermissible to cross.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.580
Nobody was killed,

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.897
although that was initially unclear,

00:26:16.897 --> 00:26:19.620
but the beatings were really quite brutal

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.770
and a lot of people
were seriously injured.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:26.748
It seems that Yanukovych was counting

00:26:26.748 --> 00:26:30.840
on the fact that if you
shock people this way,

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.070
not enough to kill people

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.170
but enough to terrify them,

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:35.820
the parents will freak out

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.120
and they will pull their
kids off the streets.

00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:42.090
And one of the people I talked to

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:46.140
about this afterwards was
a great Ukrainian novelist

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.240
who writes in the genre
of magical realism,

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.647
Taras Prokhasko,

00:26:49.647 --> 00:26:51.300
you should all read him, if you haven't,

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.450
there's quite a bit that's
been translated into English.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:58.560
His son, Markian, who was
a young journalism student,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.120
was on the Maidan in Kyiv at the time.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.880
And Taras was in Ivano-Frankivsk,

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.020
so he was not there.

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.182
He was an overnight train ride away.

00:27:10.182 --> 00:27:12.990
But his son, who was a student, was there.

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:15.450
And Markian had been
there for several days.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.950
And just coincidentally,

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.450
at like two in the morning

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:21.385
before Berkut came onto the square,

00:27:21.385 --> 00:27:25.350
he went to a friend's
apartment and fell asleep.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.210
And he had been on the
square day and night

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.470
for the past couple days.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.230
He turned off his phone and went to sleep.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.616
And there's this sudden
outbreak of brutality.

00:27:35.616 --> 00:27:36.980
People call...

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:38.880
Phone calls are being made.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.310
Taras gets a phone call,

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.520
a message from a girl who knows his son,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.530
and he's trying to get ahold of his son

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:47.363
and he can't.

00:27:47.363 --> 00:27:49.017
He's calling, and calling, and calling,

00:27:49.017 --> 00:27:51.870
and Markian is not answering the phone.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.040
And he's getting more and more distraught.

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.330
I know you guys are too
young to have children,

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.426
but it's like...

00:27:58.426 --> 00:27:59.880
As soon as you do, you are like...

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.350
I already had children by the time

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.183
that Maidan came,

00:28:02.183 --> 00:28:04.170
and you can feel it under your skin,

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.000
this terror about like not being able

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.070
to find your children at such a moment.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.060
He's calling hospitals,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.050
he's calling police stations,

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:11.880
he's calling everybody he knows in Kyiv,

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.740
and Markian is not answering the phone,

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.153
nobody else can find him.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.748
Finally, Markian wakes up,

00:28:18.748 --> 00:28:21.990
turns on the phone, finds out...

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.640
Finds hundreds of messages,

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:24.840
sees that...

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.450
Finds out what's happened.

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.740
Calls his girlfriend, now his wife,

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.210
she posted a message on Facebook

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.860
that says he's alive.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.000
He talks to his mother,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.930
talks to his father,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.040
the things you're supposed to do,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:35.910
like a good child,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.370
when your parents have been
hysterically worried about you.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.600
Keep that in mind if you're ever

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.713
in such a situation.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.700
And Taras immediately gets in his car

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.860
and starts driving...

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:47.943
Driving to Kyiv.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.640
And as I said,

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.950
it seems that Yanukovych is counting

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:55.800
on the fact that you do something violent,

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.380
and shocking, and you terrify parents,

00:28:58.380 --> 00:28:59.370
like Taras.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:00.600
And of course, he was not

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.280
the only parent who was terrified.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.360
I'm just telling you his story

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.880
because I happened to talk to him.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.601
And he thought they would then pull

00:29:08.601 --> 00:29:09.990
their kids off the streets.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:12.360
They're not gonna expose
their children to this,

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.160
And so, Taras is one of the parents

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.470
who runs to find their children.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:18.483
And when he finds Markian,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.780
he doesn't pull him off the street,

00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.863
he joins him there.

00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.133
And that's the moment
when everything turns

00:29:29.133 --> 00:29:33.660
because that is en masse
what the parents do.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.360
So you go from having had

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.930
several hundred to a
couple thousand people

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.310
on the streets of Kyiv,

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.320
to, a day and a half later,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.410
you have hundreds of thousands of people

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.180
on the streets of Kyiv.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.497
Nobody has ever seen that many people

00:29:50.497 --> 00:29:52.350
on the streets of Kyiv.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:54.367
And now, they're not just shouting,

00:29:54.367 --> 00:29:55.819
"Ukraine is Europe."

00:29:55.819 --> 00:29:57.802
Now, they're shouting,

00:29:57.802 --> 00:30:01.955
"We will not permit you
to beat our children."

00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:04.440
And interestingly, I heard this also

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.170
from people who didn't
have children there per se,

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.097
but they all became our children.

00:30:09.097 --> 00:30:11.730
"We will not permit you
to beat our children."

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.787
And that was the moment that

00:30:13.787 --> 00:30:17.280
when I talked to the...

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.170
Vasily Cherepanin, who is one of

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.067
the leading leftist intellectuals,

00:30:21.067 --> 00:30:24.750
who was probably in his
early 30s at the time,

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.280
he said "That was the moment
when Euromaidan became Maidan,"

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.020
with no prefix.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.540
And it was no longer just about

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.085
the European Union.

00:30:35.085 --> 00:30:40.020
It was now a revolt against...

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.270
Against something that, in Russian,

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.530
is called (speaking foreign language).

00:30:43.530 --> 00:30:45.750
This is a word we don't have in English,

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:47.580
but during the Trump Administration,

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:48.900
I was suggesting that we needed

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.700
to introduce it in English

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.383
because it was missing,

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.973
which is this idea of
arbitrariness tinged with tyranny.

00:30:57.893 --> 00:30:59.820
The sense of helplessness

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.100
in the face of power.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.410
The feeling that the powers that be can do

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.330
whatever they want to you,

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:07.860
and you are helpless.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.530
That you are being
treated as a play thing,

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.330
as a thing and not as a human being,

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.203
as an object and not as a subject.

00:31:15.203 --> 00:31:17.340
And the maidan became a revolt

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.870
against (speaking foreign language).

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:21.180
It became an insistence on being treated

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.430
as a person and not as a thing,

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:26.070
as a subject and not as an object,

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.497
and they began to call themselves,

00:31:29.497 --> 00:31:31.767
"On the Maidan, the
Revolution of Dignity."

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.080
And "dignity" here...

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:35.160
I really...

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.030
You're gonna...

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:38.460
I'm now exposing myself as
the intellectual historian

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:40.057
who teaches a lot of philosophy.

00:31:40.057 --> 00:31:42.840
"Dignity" here in the Kantian sense.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.670
So for those of you who
haven't been subjected

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.410
to reading Kant with me,

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.740
and if my husband hasn't
told you enough about Kant,

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.890
Kant has a famous
definition of a human being.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.677
Kant says that "Whatever can be exchanged

00:31:56.677 --> 00:32:00.578
"for something of equivalent
value has a price.

00:32:00.578 --> 00:32:03.367
"Whatever is beyond all price

00:32:03.367 --> 00:32:07.807
"and bears of no equivalent has dignity.

00:32:07.807 --> 00:32:09.847
"Human beings are distinguished

00:32:09.847 --> 00:32:12.247
"in that we possess dignity.

00:32:12.247 --> 00:32:14.817
"We do not have a price,
we possess dignity."

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.460
And from this comes Kant's
categorical imperative,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.980
which is the basis of
his moral philosophy,

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.410
which is you always treat a human being

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:27.660
as an ends and never as a means,

00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:31.140
always as a subject and not as an object.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.442
In this sense, the Maidan was
a very Kantian revolution.

00:32:34.442 --> 00:32:36.960
I realized most of the
political commentators were

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.220
not talking about Kant

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:39.840
but I said, I'm intellectual historian,

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.850
so I feel compelled to talk about Kant.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.350
It was a Kantian revolution.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.780
We wanna be treated as human beings

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.830
and we are going to insist

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.330
on being treated with dignity.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.370
It was a remarkable moment for me

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.020
as a historian because

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:58.110
so many revolutions have been emplotted

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.270
as oedipal rebellions.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.470
You can emplot, in fact,

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.134
the whole history of communism

00:33:03.134 --> 00:33:05.790
as a series of oedipal rebellions,

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.830
where each generation rises up

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:10.770
and turned against the fathers.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:14.490
So the fact that suddenly
you have parents joining

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:16.260
their children on the streets,

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:19.230
and that is the moment that
creates the revolution,

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.130
was just an extraordinary thing to witness

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:24.510
in real time.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.220
And then, when I was working on the book,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.570
I became very interested
in interviewing people

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.700
in the same family of multiple generations

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:33.960
who went to the Maidan,

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:35.340
because people then started going

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.720
to the Maidan with their children,

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.040
with their parents,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.360
sometimes with their parents

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.440
and their grandparents.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.230
You would have multiple generations going.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:45.630
And one of the...

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.381
One of the people I interviewed,

00:33:47.381 --> 00:33:49.230
together with his father,

00:33:49.230 --> 00:33:51.690
was this young kid.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.590
I mean, literally a kid.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.480
He was 16, he wasn't even at university,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.070
he was still in secondary school,

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.679
named Roman Ratushnyi,

00:33:57.679 --> 00:34:00.930
who was on the Maidan from the beginning.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.910
His shoulder was battered in

00:34:02.910 --> 00:34:05.503
on November 30th from Berkut.

00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:07.770
But he was determined to go back.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.421
He kept going back.

00:34:09.421 --> 00:34:13.620
And I was talking at this cafe in Kyiv,

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.950
and it must have been December 2014,

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.650
to Roman, to his father, Taras.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.260
And Roman was living with
his mother at the time.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.753
And I said, "Your m..."

00:34:23.753 --> 00:34:25.890
I mean, he seemed so young to me,

00:34:25.890 --> 00:34:30.397
and I said, "Your mother
must have been very upset,

00:34:30.397 --> 00:34:32.187
"but she let you go back."

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:35.263
And he said, "My mother?

00:34:35.263 --> 00:34:37.597
"My mother was making Molotov cocktails

00:34:37.597 --> 00:34:39.020
"on her (indistinct)."

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:43.770
Yes.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.990
One of the horrific pieces of news

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.660
I got in the spring early in this war was

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.170
that Roman, before his 25th birthday,

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.060
was killed in June,

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.263
fighting in the East.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.217
After that, within a couple days,

00:35:01.217 --> 00:35:05.280
the Maidan became a whole parallel polis.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:08.430
Parallel polis was a
concept that was developed

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:11.040
by the Czech dissident
philosopher, Vaclav Benda,

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.230
in the late 1970s.

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:18.030
And it was the idea that
to oppose the regime,

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.798
to oppose tyranny,

00:35:19.798 --> 00:35:22.867
was not just, or should not be primarily,

00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:24.960
"we're going to have a political protest."

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.450
It was to create an alternative space,

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:29.046
an alternative society,

00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:31.170
with your own institutions,

00:35:31.170 --> 00:35:33.606
in which you live according to the values

00:35:33.606 --> 00:35:36.270
as you wish to see them instituted

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:39.240
in the society as you wish to imagine it.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.150
The Maidan became a parallel polis.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:45.435
Within 48, 72 hours,

00:35:45.435 --> 00:35:49.230
there were elaborate kitchens running,

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.850
there was a whole infrastructure.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.130
People were cooking soup in cauldrons,

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.450
they were making tea,

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.560
they were making coffee,

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.990
there was clothing distribution points,

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.930
a piano, a stage, a library,

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.140
an open university, medical clinics.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.840
There was a whole world going on

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.080
in the Maidan.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.660
People were living on the Maidan.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.820
People were coming
every day to the Maidan.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.080
Some of them were coming in shifts

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.100
to the Maidan,

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.990
walking around the Maidan.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.760
It was getting colder and colder,

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:18.930
so you couldn't stand still,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:20.190
you had to keep walking.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:21.753
There were cleanup crews.

00:36:23.802 --> 00:36:26.190
One of the other young students

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:27.150
who was on the Maidan,

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.100
who now is fighting in the East,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.460
and who I worry about every
day, Misha Martynenko,

00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.147
said "the Maidan was so clean

00:36:34.147 --> 00:36:35.760
"you could eat off the pavement."

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.640
Everybody was taking care of this space.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.328
This was their space.

00:36:40.328 --> 00:36:43.590
People were suddenly not drinking alcohol,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.570
which was extremely unusual,

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:48.780
like in Kyiv in the winter.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:50.160
There were performances,

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.240
there were lectures,

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.950
there were discussion groups,

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:55.353
there was a whole world
that took place there.

00:36:56.733 --> 00:37:01.733
It was a masterpiece of self-organization.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.700
And interestingly, there was a sense

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.950
of an explosion of civil society,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.526
of self-organization,

00:37:09.526 --> 00:37:12.780
in a way that hadn't been anticipated.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:15.810
But I found when I pushed,

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.420
that you could find the origins

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.760
in these much smaller instances,

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.210
or more modest instances of civil society,

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.830
that had been percolating

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:27.313
beneath the surface.

00:37:27.313 --> 00:37:30.210
At one point, my friend, Katya Mischenko,

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.680
who was shuttling back and forth

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.000
at the time between Vienna,

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.670
where she had a fellowship, and Kyiv,

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:36.503
who was...

00:37:36.503 --> 00:37:37.336
Among other things,

00:37:37.336 --> 00:37:38.700
she was guarding patients

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.590
at hospitals from being kidnapped

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.210
by Yanukovych's people,

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.580
which was something he liked to do.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.640
Protestors would be injured by Berkut,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.020
and then while they were vulnerable

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.853
in the hospital,

00:37:49.853 --> 00:37:52.290
they would be kidnapped and taken away.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.420
And Katya was...

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.142
Came back to Vienna one day,

00:37:56.142 --> 00:37:58.740
and all of us were jumping on her

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.857
and say, "Okay, tell us what's going on.

00:37:59.857 --> 00:38:00.870
"Tell us what's going on."

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.630
And she was talking about
guarding people at the hospital,

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:05.910
and how they had organized teams,

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.040
and there was an SOS hotline

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.540
and if you saw somebody taken away,

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.920
you could call this number.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.390
And there were these people with cars,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.890
and they were on this program.

00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.337
And I said, "Katya, how'd you guys get

00:38:15.337 --> 00:38:17.527
"an SOS hotline overnight,

00:38:17.527 --> 00:38:18.667
"in a couple hours?

00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:20.608
"How did you get it so fast?"

00:38:20.608 --> 00:38:23.557
And she said, "Oh, well,
there was an LGBT group

00:38:23.557 --> 00:38:26.310
"that had a confidential hotline."

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.140
It was small, it was under the radar.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.560
You could call and discuss
personal issues, but...

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.760
And so, they just turned it over

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.840
to the Maidan.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.098
And I found that an interesting detail

00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:37.832
because it suggests that

00:38:37.832 --> 00:38:40.170
even if something is kind of...

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.943
Is in a very nascent, modest stage,

00:38:42.943 --> 00:38:45.342
any little bit of infrastructure,

00:38:45.342 --> 00:38:47.010
once it's there,

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:49.440
then becomes a jumping off point.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.180
You've already got a hotline set up.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.410
Maybe it's a small hotline,

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:53.520
maybe it doesn't get many calls,

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.420
but it's there.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.910
And once these little
pockets of things were there,

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.980
it turned out that there was a springboard

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.557
that was unanticipated.

00:39:00.557 --> 00:39:04.290
It was an extraordinary thing to watch.

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:07.800
There was also this sense of

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:11.130
what Europe meant changed.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:13.408
I think Europe was no longer,

00:39:13.408 --> 00:39:18.123
first and foremost, the highly imperfect,

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.480
contingent empirical manifestation

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.430
that was the European Union.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.110
Europe was Europe,

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.030
in the kind of platonic essence

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:28.260
of Europe-ness.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:30.450
Europe represented human dignity,

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.100
it represented human rights,

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:33.985
it represented the rule of law.

00:39:33.985 --> 00:39:37.560
It represented western civilization

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:40.158
in the sense that Gandhi meant

00:39:40.158 --> 00:39:41.370
when he was one...

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:43.290
Gandhi was once famously asked

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.561
what he thought about
Western civilization,

00:39:45.561 --> 00:39:47.340
and he gives this answer,

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.967
which some of you may have heard,

00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.997
"I think it would be a very good thing."

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:52.920
I mean that Europe,

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:54.570
that would be a very good thing,

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.450
was the Europe that was
at stake on the Maidan.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.249
The essence of what it would be

00:39:59.249 --> 00:40:01.860
to live under a regime of human rights

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:02.860
and the rule of law.

00:40:04.009 --> 00:40:07.710
The other thing I wanna talk about

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.333
that was so remarkable to me,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.330
and goes back to the idea

00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:15.300
of the overcoming of
a generational divide,

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.073
is this overcoming of boundaries.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.240
And I should say, my perspective
on this was influenced

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:22.500
by the fact that I was...

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.420
I was an American in Vienna,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.280
watching this livestreamed.

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.320
And the people in the
Maidan set up cameras

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.420
to live stream themselves,

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.360
so the Maidan was live
streamed 24 hours a day

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.410
on the internet,

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:37.650
which is also an uncanny, trippy thing.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.320
People turned the cameras on themselves.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.153
You were kind...

00:40:41.153 --> 00:40:43.770
It was a self-violation
of one's own privacy

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.623
in an effort to assert
one's own narrative.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.590
And so, I was an American,

00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.420
watching this livestream from Vienna,

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.400
but in some ways, I was watching it,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.410
above all, through Polish eyes.

00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.560
I mean, I was following the
press in different languages,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.930
including in English and German.

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:03.870
But the coverage I was
somehow clinging to most was

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:05.880
the coverage coming from Poland.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:09.210
And in particular, what
my friends in Poland,

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.380
who had been veterans of Solidarity

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.250
in the 70s and 80s,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.420
and who had sat in prison under communism,

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.790
were writing.

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.990
And maybe, I'll just take
a little brief detour here

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:23.430
to say something about that.

00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:24.300
So there's...

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:26.490
There are two remarkable Polish films,

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.840
which you should all watch,

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.440
by the great director, Andrzej Wajda.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:33.697
They're in a series
starring Krystyna Janda,

00:41:33.697 --> 00:41:36.510
"Man of Marble" and "Man of Iron."

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.570
And in the second one, "Man of Iron,"

00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:40.530
it...

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.550
Early in the film,

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.950
we are in 1968 in Poland.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.020
In 1968 in Poland,

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.850
the students lead protest

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.223
against communist government censorship,

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.660
and many of them end up in prison,

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.000
including many of those
people who were still...

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.320
Who were watching the Maidan,

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:01.590
and who I was in close
touch with watching this.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.720
And in the film, one...

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.480
Which is fictional, but
based on real events.

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.860
A young man, a student,

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:09.960
goes to his father, who
is a shipyard worker,

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.930
in 1968, as the communist
secret police are coming

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.310
and battering the students,

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:17.160
and asks his father to
bring out the workers

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.324
in solidarity with the students.

00:42:19.324 --> 00:42:21.900
And the father refuses,

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.188
and he locks the son in his room,

00:42:24.188 --> 00:42:28.087
and he says, "Someday,
when the time is right,

00:42:28.087 --> 00:42:29.493
"we'll march together."

00:42:29.493 --> 00:42:31.210
And the son is livid.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:34.927
And he says, "No, I
will never forgive you.

00:42:34.927 --> 00:42:37.260
"We will never march together."

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.351
And two years later, in Poland,

00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:43.160
it's the shipyard workers who demonstrate

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.120
against the regime.

00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.380
And in the film,

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.420
in Wajda's film, "Man of Iron,"

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.640
the father then comes to his son

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.680
and ask him to bring
him and his friends out

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.810
in solidarity with the workers.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:56.520
And at that time,

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.757
the son basically says,

00:42:57.757 --> 00:42:59.497
"Hey, you let us down two years ago,

00:42:59.497 --> 00:43:00.657
"now you go to hell."

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.440
And what Solidarity was in Poland,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.410
both in its proto form,

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.578
as the Committee for the
Defense of the Workers,

00:43:09.578 --> 00:43:12.180
which was spearheaded by Adam Michnik

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.100
and others in 1976,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.572
and then the form it evolves into

00:43:16.572 --> 00:43:20.250
through 1980 and 1981,

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:23.670
was this remarkable moment
of the coming together

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.560
of the fathers and the sons,

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.623
and the workers and the intellectuals,

00:43:27.623 --> 00:43:31.680
and the Catholics and the Marxist,

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.320
and the Jews and the Poles,

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.633
and all of these hitherto
existing boundaries.

00:43:37.592 --> 00:43:41.100
And that was what happened on the Maidan.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.450
You had people who never

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:44.760
in their lives would have
encountered one another,

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.350
who wouldn't have necessarily been

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.747
on the same side,

00:43:47.747 --> 00:43:49.770
who wouldn't have shared a common way

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:51.450
of understanding the world,

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.320
suddenly encounter one another

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:56.681
with this kind of openness

00:43:56.681 --> 00:44:00.570
that people would not have expected.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.060
And it was watching...

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.990
I think part of my captivation was seeing

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.240
how people like Konsta Gebert,

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.490
and Adam Michnik, and Aleksander Smolar,

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:16.170
and these veterans of Solidarity
were watching the Maidan

00:44:16.170 --> 00:44:19.591
because they knew better than anybody else

00:44:19.591 --> 00:44:22.080
that that Solidarity,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.320
that Solidarność
in Poland represented it,

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:26.940
that it lasted 20 seconds

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.907
after communism fell.

00:44:28.907 --> 00:44:32.220
But they also knew that it was

00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.785
this extraordinarily precious thing

00:44:34.785 --> 00:44:38.340
that most people never experience,

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:40.260
and they never counted on living

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.930
to see a second time in their lifetimes.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.130
And they appreciated it,

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.750
they knew what it meant.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.340
They knew that it was that miracle

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.413
that most people never experience.

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:54.330
And that that was what
the Poles understood

00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:55.163
about the Maidan.

00:44:55.163 --> 00:44:58.830
I think that's why the
coverage was so different.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.060
In the German press,

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.970
people were talking
about the kids in Kyiv,

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.170
supportively, but in a
slightly condescending way.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:08.400
In the Polish press,

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.764
they were talking about
powstanie.

00:45:10.764 --> 00:45:12.390
powstanie,
which is insurrectionary.

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:14.910
It's like this romantic, lofty,

00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:16.230
noble word in Poland,

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:18.097
to talk about powstanie.

00:45:18.097 --> 00:45:21.090
"Those who fight for
our freedom and yours."

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:21.923
Okay, I see I'm...

00:45:21.923 --> 00:45:23.280
Okay, I see I'm running out of time,

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.113
so let me...

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.100
People stay on the Maidan.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.333
They stay all winter.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.403
They stay and freeze,

00:45:33.403 --> 00:45:36.194
and the stakes get higher and higher,

00:45:36.194 --> 00:45:38.910
and the government violence becomes

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.323
more and more severe.

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.910
Peoples disappear.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:47.643
Sometimes their bodies are found,

00:45:47.643 --> 00:45:50.145
having been tortured and frozen

00:45:50.145 --> 00:45:51.603
in the woods.

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:58.910
Activists are frozen and
battered with fire hoses.

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:04.853
There are...

00:46:04.853 --> 00:46:08.193
There's a sense that the
violence is only increasing.

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:13.327
And again, it seems to be
that Yanukovych is saying,

00:46:13.327 --> 00:46:15.037
"If you keep raising the stakes,

00:46:15.037 --> 00:46:17.190
"it's going to stop."

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:19.806
But it has the opposite effect

00:46:19.806 --> 00:46:21.865
because at a certain point,

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:26.349
you can push people to
the other side of fear.

00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:28.530
You can push them to the point

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:30.111
where they feel that

00:46:30.111 --> 00:46:32.197
"no one will ever be safe

00:46:32.197 --> 00:46:34.237
"as long as this man is in power.

00:46:34.237 --> 00:46:36.037
"The only way any of us are going

00:46:36.037 --> 00:46:37.717
"to be able to breathe again is

00:46:37.717 --> 00:46:38.850
"if he's overthrown."

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.703
The stakes become all or nothing.

00:46:44.014 --> 00:46:45.660
Remarkably...

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.670
I mean, even watching from a distance,

00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:49.170
even watching this livestream,

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:52.980
you could feel a kind of
existential transformation.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.990
When those students went out

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:57.188
to the Maidan in November,

00:46:57.188 --> 00:46:59.992
nobody was thinking,
"We're gonna die here,"

00:46:59.992 --> 00:47:02.400
or "We're ready to die here."

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.950
And by the second half of January,

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.440
you could feel, almost palpably,

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.940
and even from a distance

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:10.710
that something had turned,

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.740
and a critical mass of people was ready

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.889
to die there if need be.

00:47:15.889 --> 00:47:17.640
And then, you were kind of...

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.740
You were just waiting for the end game.

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:22.560
You knew that more
violence was going to come,

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:25.890
and you knew that those
people were not gonna leave.

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:28.770
And there was this sense
of voyeuristic terror

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:31.170
that I was watching this with,

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:33.603
and many people were watching this with.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.640
This happened in the second
half of February 2014,

00:47:42.557 --> 00:47:46.170
where Yanukovych's regime unleashes

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.605
a sniper massacre,

00:47:47.605 --> 00:47:51.993
and there are snipers on
buildings firing down.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:59.940
And this is all being live streamed,

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.901
so you are watching people being killed

00:48:02.901 --> 00:48:04.350
in real time.

00:48:04.350 --> 00:48:06.500
You're watching these
battles in real time.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:12.090
More and more reinforcements
start coming to Kyiv.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:15.150
In Lviv, there's a former
real estate agent...

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:16.860
Or she's still a real estate agent now,

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.507
but she turned herself into

00:48:19.507 --> 00:48:21.899
a committee to organize buses.

00:48:21.899 --> 00:48:24.240
They were just putting people on buses

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.095
and sending people to Kyiv.

00:48:26.095 --> 00:48:27.659
And people wanted to go.

00:48:27.659 --> 00:48:29.400
More people wanted to go

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:31.023
than they could produce buses.

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:37.650
Radek Sikorski, who was
the Polish Prime Minister

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:40.050
at the time during this massacre,

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.850
flies over to Kyiv

00:48:41.850 --> 00:48:44.070
to try to negotiate a ceasefire.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:46.049
He goes to the presidential palace

00:48:46.049 --> 00:48:48.120
to talk to Yanukovych.

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.820
The presidential palace is very close

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.500
to the Maidan.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.600
I mean, Radek gets there

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.520
and you can smell the smoke.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.780
I mean, things are burning,

00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.950
buildings are burning,

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:00.150
people are burning.

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:01.230
You can smell the smoke

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.550
in the presidential palace.

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:05.400
He goes in to talk to Yanukovych.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:06.334
I found this...

00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:09.540
I found this kind of extraordinary

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:10.530
because I thought...

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:11.790
When I talked to him afterwards,

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:12.787
I thought, "Radek, you're sitting there,

00:49:12.787 --> 00:49:14.107
"talking to this man.

00:49:14.107 --> 00:49:15.337
"You know that with every

00:49:15.337 --> 00:49:17.137
"additional five minutes that takes,

00:49:17.137 --> 00:49:19.066
"more people are being killed.

00:49:19.066 --> 00:49:21.397
"And you know you're talking to someone

00:49:21.397 --> 00:49:22.747
"for whom other people's lives

00:49:22.747 --> 00:49:24.217
"just don't have any value.

00:49:24.217 --> 00:49:26.737
"I mean, was he at all concerned about

00:49:26.737 --> 00:49:28.087
"these people who were being killed

00:49:28.087 --> 00:49:29.850
"as you were talking to him?"

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.907
And Radek is like,

00:49:30.907 --> 00:49:33.697
"Marci, he doesn't have much
of an emotional imagination.

00:49:33.697 --> 00:49:34.627
"He's not that bright.

00:49:34.627 --> 00:49:37.260
"No, he didn't seem concerned at all."

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:41.338
But finally, they managed
to negotiate a ceasefire,

00:49:41.338 --> 00:49:43.650
and a call for early elections.

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:45.960
Yanukovych agrees to early elections.

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.080
Not immediately, but
several months from then.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.404
People in the Maidan do not wanna sign it.

00:49:51.404 --> 00:49:53.100
They don't trust the president.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.020
They've just seen their people die.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.180
Radek takes a very hard line stance

00:49:57.180 --> 00:49:58.357
and says, "Hey, listen,

00:49:58.357 --> 00:50:00.577
"I grew up in Poland under Solidarity.

00:50:00.577 --> 00:50:03.476
"We underestimated the
strength of the regime,

00:50:03.476 --> 00:50:06.997
"and we got martial
law and mass detention.

00:50:06.997 --> 00:50:08.377
"So you accept this now.

00:50:08.377 --> 00:50:09.697
"Later, you push for more.

00:50:09.697 --> 00:50:11.017
"Otherwise, you're gonna get the army,

00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:11.917
"you're gonna get martial law,

00:50:11.917 --> 00:50:13.267
"you're all gonna be dead."

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:16.080
And they sign.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.510
But it's clear that
people are just furious.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:22.650
I mean, they're carrying
corpses in caskets

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.120
through the Maidan,

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.055
and Yanukovych flees.

00:50:26.055 --> 00:50:28.953
He flees across the border to Russia.

00:50:30.074 --> 00:50:32.679
And Paul Manafort is out of a job.

00:50:32.679 --> 00:50:36.663
We all know what he does next.

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:39.960
Little green men

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.750
in unmarked camouflage appear

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:44.820
on the Crimean Peninsula,

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.627
sent by the Kremlin.

00:50:46.627 --> 00:50:49.860
While no one has had a
chance to catch their breath,

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.360
one president has fled,

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.174
he's been deposed.

00:50:53.174 --> 00:50:55.740
There's an interim government,

00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:57.450
but they haven't had elections yet

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:00.265
and nobody really knows what's going on.

00:51:00.265 --> 00:51:03.390
And Putin capitalizes on, particularly,

00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:06.480
that moment to try to take Crimea...

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.320
To take Crimea,

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:12.067
and to instigate separatist rebellions

00:51:12.067 --> 00:51:15.540
throughout eastern and
southeastern Ukraine.

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:19.113
So-called "Russian tourist"
come across the border.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.260
They have been told various stories,

00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.750
one of which is that the Maidan was

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:28.470
a CIA-sponsored conspiracy,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.200
and that Ukrainian Nazis
are now heading east

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.603
to kill all the Russian speakers.

00:51:35.152 --> 00:51:37.668
I don't have time to go into,

00:51:37.668 --> 00:51:39.360
unfortunately, the rest of that story,

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.137
but I'm sure after the break,

00:51:41.137 --> 00:51:43.620
you will be caught up as to what happens

00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:45.270
after the annexation of Crimea

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:48.423
and the beginning of
the war in the Donbas.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.873
Let me just...

00:51:50.873 --> 00:51:53.430
Maybe if I can say something philosophical

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.696
and existential at the end.

00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:59.940
So I'm not really a
political historian per se.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.920
One of the things that struck me most

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.300
about the accounts people were giving

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.450
on the Maidan was how
everybody started talking about

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:08.370
how they lost track of time.

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:09.960
Something happens to time

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.160
during a revolution.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.450
It changes its form.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.970
You can't remember what
happened an hour ago,

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:16.110
what happened the day before,

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:17.730
what happened a week before.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:19.230
I mean, one of the principles

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.720
of revolution is that the state of affairs

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.000
that obtained five
minutes ago could become

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.340
completely irrelevant five minutes later.

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:28.470
That anything can change at any moment.

00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:30.390
That suddenly, there was an effacing

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:32.460
of the boundary between night and day.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.792
You could call anyone at any time.

00:52:34.792 --> 00:52:35.828
(That)

00:52:35.828 --> 00:52:38.850
That was true if you were
15 or if you were 75,

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:41.130
that the experience of time changed.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.570
And I became very interested

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:44.100
in thinking about time.

00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:45.600
Time and revolution.

00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.340
And one of the things I learned

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:48.630
from the Maidan,

00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:50.820
or learned from the accounts of the Maidan

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.140
that I was getting from my friends,

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.310
and colleagues, and other people

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:54.731
who were there,

00:52:54.731 --> 00:52:58.320
was an appreciation of
Sartre's idea of time,

00:52:58.320 --> 00:52:59.340
of the present.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.988
The present is a border.

00:53:00.988 --> 00:53:03.524
The present is a border between...

00:53:03.524 --> 00:53:06.750
Between what Sartre
calls "the inward self."

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.730
Facticity, what has already happened,

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.710
who you have been up to this moment,

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:12.720
what cannot be changed,

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:14.220
and "the forward self."

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.630
What is coming in the future,

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:17.610
what is not yet determined,

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.040
what is the possibility for transcendence,

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.380
to go beyond what has been

00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:25.200
and who you have been up to this moment.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.270
And that border is with us,

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:28.800
every moment of our lives.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.880
The present is the moment

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.380
of that crossing of the border

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:32.760
from what has already been

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:33.930
and who we have been

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:35.820
to the possibility of going beyond,

00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.470
but we normally don't feel it,

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.600
we normally don't turn
our attention to it.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.160
And revolution is that moment

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.070
when you suddenly shine a glaring light

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.210
on that border,

00:53:45.210 --> 00:53:48.975
and you are shaken into
understanding the present

00:53:48.975 --> 00:53:52.830
as the moment of the
possibility of going beyond.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.004
Thank you.

00:53:54.004 --> 00:53:57.171
(audience applauding)

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.677
(calm music)

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.745
Professor Charles
Bailyn: So,

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:06.696
we've been talking about
transits and I want to say a

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:09.930
couple things more just to round
out that discussion.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.518
You'll recall how this works.
Transits--you get light

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:24.180
blocked--light from the star
blocked by the planet.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.367
And in order for this to occur,
the orbit has to be exactly

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:31.097
edge-on;
otherwise, the planet doesn't

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.560
actually get in the way between
you and the star.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.440
So, must be edge-on.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.772
And so, what you see,
basically, although you're too

00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:46.568
far away to see it in this kind
of detail, looks something like

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:49.018
this.
Here's a star,

00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:54.308
it's got this big,
bright, shining disc,

00:00:54.308 --> 00:01:02.990
and then crossing that star is
a darker disc from the planet.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.930
So, it looks like you have a
little spot there.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.551
And it's clear,
just from the geometry of this

00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:12.769
situation, how much light is
obscured.

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:17.680
It's basically the ratio of the
cross-section of the planet to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.682
that of the star.
So, the depth of the transit,

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:25.773
and by that I mean,
you know, the fraction of the

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:27.990
light that is obscured,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.733
is equal to--that will be,
the cross-section of the planet

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:49.040
divided by the cross-section of
the star.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.739
And the cross-section is just
the projected area.

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.088
And so, what that means in
practice is, here's the radius

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:07.010
of the star, and there's an
equivalent radius of the planet.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.550
And it's just the ratio of the
projected areas.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.900
Now, the area of a circle,
projected area of a sphere is a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.946
circle.
The area of a circle,

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:18.990
you probably remember from
geometry, is πr^(2).

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.774
And som what this is going to
be is πr of the planet

00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:28.396
squared, divided by πr
of the star squared and the

00:02:28.396 --> 00:02:33.148
πs cancel.
So, it's the ratio of the

00:02:33.148 --> 00:02:37.303
squares of the radii.
Okay, so to take an

00:02:37.303 --> 00:02:42.342
example--supposing you were an
astronomer in some distant place

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:46.729
and you're looking at the--at
our own Solar System.

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.814
And you're fortunate enough to
be in a place where you can see

00:02:49.814 --> 00:02:52.900
our Solar System edge-on.
What would you see when the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.074
Earth transits the Sun?
So the Earth's--so here's an

00:02:58.074 --> 00:03:02.630
example: Earth transiting the
Sun.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.535
The radius of the Earth,
it turns out,

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:13.539
is something like 7 x 10^(6)
meters.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:17.984
The radius of the Sun is about
100 times that,

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:25.055
7 x 10^(8) meters.
And so, the depth of such a

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:34.870
transit is the square of the
ratios of these radii.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:47.931
(7 x 10^(6)) / (7 x 10^(8))^(2)
That's (10 ^(-2))^(2) = 10^(-4)

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:53.264
, or 0.01%.
So, that's a lot less than what

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:58.120
you found in section yesterday
for a Jupiter-like planet.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.359
And the key is in this
r^(2) factor,

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.678
until the Earth is about
1/10--has about 1/10 the radius,

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.610
is about 1/10 the size of
Jupiter.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.569
But that tenth gets squared,
so that's 100.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.560
And so, instead of getting a 1%
dip in the light,

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.240
or approximately 1%,
you get a 1/100 of 1%.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.781
1/100 x 1% = 10^(-4).
So, as the planet gets smaller

00:04:29.781 --> 00:04:34.040
you--it becomes harder and
harder to see these transits.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.967
And, if you think back on the
pictures of these light curves,

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:41.741
the graphs that were made,
in the observations from the

00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:45.833
ground, you really needed to
have about a 1% dip in order to

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:48.817
be able to see it.
From space you can do a lot

00:04:48.817 --> 00:04:50.824
better.
Things are much more stable,

00:04:50.824 --> 00:04:53.765
and you might well be able to
see something like this,

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:57.040
but only from space and not
necessarily from the ground.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.709
Now, having done this little
calculation, of course,

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.300
in real life,
you do it backwards.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.374
What I did here was I assumed
that I knew what the radius is,

00:05:06.374 --> 00:05:08.680
and I calculated what the
transit would be.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.566
That isn't how it works with
extra solar planets because,

00:05:11.566 --> 00:05:13.990
of course, you don't know what
the radius is.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.821
And instead,
what happens is,

00:05:15.821 --> 00:05:18.445
you see the transit.
And you see the transit,

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.259
and you work backwards to
figure out what the radius is.

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.929
You have to make some
assumption about what the radius

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:27.002
of the star is likely to be.
And so, basically,

00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:32.209
observing a transit is a way to
get the radius of the star.

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:38.050
So transits give you the
radius--and this is nice,

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.459
because the radial velocity
method,

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:46.086
the Doppler shift
method--Doppler measurements –

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:49.120
also give you something about
the star.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.550
But it's the mass not the
radius.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.047
And then, if you have both of
these things,

00:05:54.047 --> 00:05:57.377
then you get to put them
together and figure out what the

00:05:57.377 --> 00:05:59.920
density is.
And that's why observing both

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.709
of these things in the same
system is so useful.

00:06:02.709 --> 00:06:05.870
So let's do this again for the
Earth.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.329
The mass of the Earth is 6 x
10^(24) kilograms.

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:17.069
The radius of the Earth we just
figured out, 7 x 10^(6) meters.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.349
And, our hypothetical
astronomers out there in the

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:23.762
rest of the galaxy somewhere
would have been able to

00:06:23.762 --> 00:06:26.640
determine this if they saw the
transit.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.356
So now, what is the density?
Density is this Greek letter

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:36.189
ρ, symbolically,
and that is equal to mass over

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:41.560
volume, which is equal to mass
over (4/3πr) ^(3).

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.997
π = 3.
So that cancels,

00:06:43.997 --> 00:06:47.380
which is helpful.
And let's see,

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.786
so the mass on top,
6 x 10^(24) divided by 4,

00:06:52.786 --> 00:06:57.430
times this quantity cubed.
Now, what do we do about that?

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.298
7 x 7 = 50, right?
So, this is 7 x 50,

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:07.924
which is 350.
So let's see,

00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:15.395
this is equal to (6 x 10^(24))
/ (4 x 350 x (10^(6))^(3)),

00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:19.590
which is 10^(18),
6 x 3 = 18.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.700
And so what's this?
Oh!

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.360
I don't know;
this is 1,400.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.168
And so this,
then, in turn,

00:07:29.168 --> 00:07:37.664
is equal to (6 x 10^(24)) /
(1.4 x 10^(21)) because this is

00:07:37.664 --> 00:07:43.536
1.4 x 10^(3) x 10^(18).
6 / 1.4 = 4,

00:07:43.536 --> 00:07:48.009
give or take,
times 10^(3).

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.310
And that's the answer,
that's the density.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.310
In what units?
Let's see, this had better be

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.750
kilograms per meter cubed.
It's an MKS calculation.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.454
Why?
Because that's what I started

00:08:01.454 --> 00:08:05.360
with, kilograms and meters.
4 x 10^(3) kilograms per meter

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.910
cubed, what does that tell you?
What does that tell you?

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.690
Four times more dense than
water, excellent.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:24.946
So, this is 4 times water.
Water is defined to be 10^(3)

00:08:24.946 --> 00:08:29.524
kilograms per meter
cubed--density of water--or

00:08:29.524 --> 00:08:32.980
rather,
a kilogram is defined so that

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:35.950
water has that particular
density.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.688
It's 4 times water.
That makes it a rocky planet,

00:08:40.688 --> 00:08:46.779
because the ices and the gases
that make up a typical gas giant

00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:52.279
planet don't get--don't achieve
that kind of density.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.297
And so, our hypothetical
astronomers observing this

00:08:55.297 --> 00:08:58.616
transit would have determined
not only that the Earth is

00:08:58.616 --> 00:09:01.037
there,
but also that it's got to be

00:09:01.037 --> 00:09:04.382
made out of rocks.
And that is an additional piece

00:09:04.382 --> 00:09:08.333
of information that's really
useful in trying to figure out

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:11.399
what's going on in these kinds
of systems.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:18.213
Okay, now, it turns out that
there are some other methods for

00:09:18.213 --> 00:09:22.870
identifying planets around other
stars.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:25.169
And I want to talk about one of
them.

00:09:25.169 --> 00:09:28.481
And the reason I haven't talked
about this one more is because

00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:31.629
it hasn't yet discovered any
planets around other stars.

00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:35.050
There have been lots of planets
discovered by the radial

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:38.178
velocity method.
There have been lots of planets

00:09:38.178 --> 00:09:41.611
discovered now by transits,
now with the latest Hubble

00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:45.353
Space Telescope results,
but those are not the first

00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:48.011
methods that were tried.
For a long time,

00:09:48.011 --> 00:09:49.938
people have been trying
something else,

00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:53.465
and it hasn't really worked.
And this is called astrometry,

00:09:53.465 --> 00:09:55.160
so here's another method.

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:08.919
Astrometry means "measuring
stars" in Greek.

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:12.430
And basically what this is,
is it's determining the

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.799
positions of stars to extremely
high accuracy.

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:18.955
Remember, the whole game here
is that the star moves,

00:10:18.955 --> 00:10:20.640
too.
And we've been using Doppler

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.188
shift measurements to measure
the velocity of the star,

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:25.641
the radial velocity of the
star, as it goes round and

00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:27.030
round.
But you could,

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.581
in principle,
also try and figure out that

00:10:29.581 --> 00:10:33.750
the actual position of the star
in space moves a little bit too.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:42.064
So, observing change in
position of the star--now that

00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:47.078
change is quite small.
And you'll recall that we

00:10:47.078 --> 00:10:49.276
started out a few weeks ago
saying, you know,

00:10:49.276 --> 00:10:51.873
you don't see the star all that
accurately because of

00:10:51.873 --> 00:10:54.370
atmospheric distortion and
optical problems in your

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.919
telescope.
You just see this big blob of

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:59.647
light.
And the key point here is that

00:10:59.647 --> 00:11:03.200
it is actually not--if you have
enough light,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.110
you can determine the center of
a big blob of light really quite

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:16.968
accurately.
Determine the center of a blob

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:29.139
of light to much greater
accuracy than the extent of the

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:31.769
blob.
So, you know,

00:11:31.769 --> 00:11:35.603
I take a picture of a star and
I see something that kind of

00:11:35.603 --> 00:11:38.488
looks like this.
And that's big and ugly and

00:11:38.488 --> 00:11:40.598
hard to deal with,
except, you know,

00:11:40.598 --> 00:11:44.276
the accuracy of the position of
that blob isn't limited by the

00:11:44.276 --> 00:11:46.414
extent.
You know that the center is

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.803
somewhere around here.
And if that blob were to move

00:11:49.803 --> 00:11:54.621
slightly so that the center took
a little--went around in circles

00:11:54.621 --> 00:11:57.184
like this,
you'd actually be able to see

00:11:57.184 --> 00:11:59.970
that as this big blob sort of
moves slowly around.

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.419
And that's the trick with
astrometry.

00:12:03.419 --> 00:12:06.274
So, you do these repeated
measurements of the precise

00:12:06.274 --> 00:12:09.128
position of the star,
and you ought to be able to see

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:11.968
it going around in circles.
So, we have,

00:12:11.968 --> 00:12:17.850
in fact, all the equations we
need to deal with this already.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:24.752
And so, let's just go straight
to a particular exercise,

00:12:24.752 --> 00:12:30.681
a calculation.
How big a change in the Sun's

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:38.524
position due to the planet
Jupiter, because that's the most

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:44.610
massive and will make the most
difference,

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:52.065
would you see if you're on
Alpha Centauri?--would an Alpha

00:12:52.065 --> 00:12:57.127
Centauri astronomer observe?
So here's the situation:

00:12:57.127 --> 00:12:58.740
you're sitting on Alpha
Centauri.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.937
You're looking back--which is
the nearest star,

00:13:00.937 --> 00:13:03.299
you may recall.
You're looking back at the

00:13:03.299 --> 00:13:05.741
Solar System,
and you're hoping to see the

00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:09.018
change in movement of the Sun
due to the presence of the

00:13:09.018 --> 00:13:13.030
planet Jupiter.
So, the first thing to say

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:17.587
about this is,
what do we mean by change in

00:13:17.587 --> 00:13:23.000
position?
Change in position.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.750
What we're talking about is an
angle.

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.320
We talked about this in a
different context before.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:33.049
Here's the observer.
Here's the star.

00:13:33.049 --> 00:13:36.049
And the star's moving,
it's going to move up to here.

00:13:36.049 --> 00:13:39.669
And what we want is to draw
this triangle,

00:13:39.669 --> 00:13:43.393
and we want an angle.
And then D_2

00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:46.138
over here is the amount by which
the star moves,

00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:49.759
D_1 over here
is the distance to the star.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:56.373
And we want the angular change
in position, because that's what

00:13:56.373 --> 00:14:02.240
we mean when we make a position
measurement in space.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.899
Okay, so that's the first thing
is to understand what the answer

00:14:05.899 --> 00:14:08.811
ought to look like.
It's got to be some kind of

00:14:08.811 --> 00:14:10.907
angle.
And then the second thing is,

00:14:10.907 --> 00:14:14.335
I've done my usual trick here
of not giving you a whole bunch

00:14:14.335 --> 00:14:16.850
of information that you're going
to need.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:21.747
And so, the first thing you
have to do in order to line

00:14:21.747 --> 00:14:27.097
up--try and set up the answer is
you have to figure out some

00:14:27.097 --> 00:14:29.939
actual answer.
So, the mass of the Sun is

00:14:29.939 --> 00:14:31.800
obviously equal to the mass of
the Sun;

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.771
that's easy.
The mass of Jupiter is equal to

00:14:36.771 --> 00:14:42.983
2 x 10^(27) kilograms,
that's 1/1000 of the mass of

00:14:42.983 --> 00:14:47.260
the Sun.
The distance from Alpha Cen to

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:52.500
us--Sun--from Alpha Cen to the
Sun is about 1 parsec.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.891
I think I mentioned that
before, because this is the

00:14:55.891 --> 00:15:00.782
closest star that there is.
And the semi-major axis of

00:15:00.782 --> 00:15:06.480
Jupiter's orbit is equal to 5
Astronomical Units.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.399
I wrote that down on the first
day of class.

00:15:10.399 --> 00:15:12.680
So you're going to need all
this information.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.929
Now, here's the trick;
here's Jupiter doing its 5

00:15:16.929 --> 00:15:22.080
Astronomical Unit thing,
and then the Sun in the middle.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:28.590
Here's the center of mass,
center of mass.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.430
And the Sun is doing a little
circuit in the other direction,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:38.432
always making sure that it's on
the other side of the center of

00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:42.276
mass from the planet.
That's what a center of mass

00:15:42.276 --> 00:15:46.233
means, right?
And then we can take--at one

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:51.994
point here's the--let's say,
here's the Sun and here's

00:15:51.994 --> 00:15:55.615
Jupiter.
And we take this little line

00:15:55.615 --> 00:15:59.254
here, and the whole of the
distance here is

00:15:59.254 --> 00:16:03.045
a_total.
And the distance from the

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:06.159
planet to the center of mass is
a_planet,

00:16:06.159 --> 00:16:09.710
and this tiny little distance
here is a_star.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.261
And what we need to look for is
a_star in this

00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:14.607
case, because we're watching the
star go round in circles,

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:17.209
not the planet.
And then, the usual equations

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:21.035
apply where M_star
a_star is

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:23.105
equal to
M_planet

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.630
a_planet.
We've seen this equation in

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.558
dealing with velocities,
but it's the same thing in

00:16:29.558 --> 00:16:32.418
distances,
because, the time that it takes

00:16:32.418 --> 00:16:36.479
to go around these circles is
one orbital period--is the same

00:16:36.479 --> 00:16:39.098
in both cases.
So, if the velocity is slower,

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.021
then you cover less ground.
Or, to put it a different way,

00:16:42.021 --> 00:16:44.916
if you're going in a smaller
circle, you're not moving as

00:16:44.916 --> 00:16:47.650
fast.
So, it's the same equation.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.101
And so, let's do this.
a_star =

00:16:50.101 --> 00:16:53.171
(M_planet /
M_star) x

00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:56.460
a_planet.
That's 5 A.U.

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:58.379
in the case of--in this
particular case.

00:16:58.379 --> 00:17:02.132
And I've already said that the
mass of the planet is equal to

00:17:02.132 --> 00:17:04.760
10^(-3) times the mass of the
star here.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.256
So, this is 10^(-3).
So, this is 5 x 10^(-3)

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:13.956
Astronomical Units.
That's how far the--that's the

00:17:13.956 --> 00:17:19.389
radius of the Sun's orbit around
the center of mass with Jupiter,

00:17:19.389 --> 00:17:22.700
if you want to think of it that
way.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.050
But that's not the answer we
want.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:24.950
We want an angle.

00:17:29.299 --> 00:17:32.940
And this in A.U.,
and this, here,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.400
in parsecs, will give us angle
in arc seconds.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.170
And this is a particularly easy
one.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.944
We already have 5 x 10^(-3)
A.U., and the distance is 1

00:17:44.944 --> 00:17:50.196
parsec.
And so, this is 5 x 10^(-3) arc

00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:53.099
seconds.
Five milli-arc seconds.

00:17:53.099 --> 00:17:57.334
Now, that's much smaller than
the size of the blob of light

00:17:57.334 --> 00:17:59.825
from Alpha Centauri.
But, as I said,

00:17:59.825 --> 00:18:03.190
you can see the motion of the
center of a blob of light to

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.965
fairly high accuracy,
and this is pretty readily

00:18:05.965 --> 00:18:06.910
observable.

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:16.091
So, folks sitting on Alpha
Centauri would know that

00:18:16.091 --> 00:18:19.775
the--who have our kind--our
level of technology would

00:18:19.775 --> 00:18:23.599
already know that Jupiter exists
from this method.

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:27.627
Interestingly,
we can look at Alpha Centauri,

00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:29.776
right?
You can do this backwards and

00:18:29.776 --> 00:18:32.659
you get exactly the same answer,
because Alpha Centauri is a

00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:35.651
Sun-like star,
has exactly the same mass,

00:18:35.651 --> 00:18:39.890
and we don't observe any such
motion in Alpha Cen.

00:18:47.549 --> 00:18:53.168
And so, there is no
Jupiter-like planet around Alpha

00:18:53.168 --> 00:18:54.980
Cen.
We know that because if there

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.243
had been, we would have seen it
through this--through this

00:18:57.243 --> 00:18:57.640
method.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.344
Now, you can do the same thing,
let me do it quickly,

00:19:06.344 --> 00:19:08.799
for the Earth.
Supposing you want to detect

00:19:08.799 --> 00:19:10.100
the Earth in this way.
So

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.039
a_planet--so
this is for Earth.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:17.620
a of the planet is now 1
A.U.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:23.022
instead of 5 A.U.s.
Mass of the planet is 6 x

00:19:23.022 --> 00:19:27.989
10^(24).
So mass of the planet over mass

00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:33.480
of the star is (6 x 10^(24)) /
(2 x 10^(30)).

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:42.379
That's 3 x 10^(-6).
And so the a of the Sun

00:19:42.379 --> 00:19:47.697
due to the Earth now,
not due to Jupiter,

00:19:47.697 --> 00:19:53.188
is equal to 1 A.U.
That's the size of the planet

00:19:53.188 --> 00:19:58.119
times the ratio of the masses,
which is 3 x 10^(-6).

00:19:58.119 --> 00:20:03.970
So it's 3 x 10^(-6) A.U.,
much less than for Jupiter,

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:08.095
which was 5 x 10^(-3).
And then, Alpha equals

00:20:08.095 --> 00:20:11.010
D_2 /
D_1.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:18.380
(3 x 10^(-6)) / 1.
Three micro-arc seconds.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:22.700
This is not observable,
at least not with current

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.174
technology.
So, our friends on Alpha

00:20:25.174 --> 00:20:28.380
Centauri, who know that there's
Jupiter, don't yet know that

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.049
Earth exists,
because this is so much smaller

00:20:32.049 --> 00:20:36.106
than the effect due to Jupiter.
And it's smaller for two

00:20:36.106 --> 00:20:39.108
different reasons.
One reason is that the mass of

00:20:39.108 --> 00:20:41.880
Earth is small,
so this ratio is small.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.129
The other is that the Earth's
orbit is shorter,

00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:47.480
so it's 1 A.U.
instead of 5 A.U.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.460
So, you're multiplying two
numbers together.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:54.641
Instead of multiplying 5 by
10^(-3), you're multiplying 1 by

00:20:54.641 --> 00:20:57.121
10^(-6).
And so, both of those numbers

00:20:57.121 --> 00:20:59.498
are smaller.
And so, the effect is that much

00:20:59.498 --> 00:21:02.385
smaller.
So we can't yet--our friends on

00:21:02.385 --> 00:21:06.109
Alpha Centauri can't tell
whether we have Earths,

00:21:06.109 --> 00:21:10.376
and likewise we can't tell
whether Alpha Centauri has an

00:21:10.376 --> 00:21:12.730
Earth.
So, one of the interesting

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:16.078
things about the astrometry
method, and this is why I bring

00:21:16.078 --> 00:21:19.080
the whole thing up,
is that it favors big orbits.

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.245
The bigger the orbit,
the bigger the motion of both

00:21:28.245 --> 00:21:32.595
the star and the planet.
This is exactly opposite to

00:21:32.595 --> 00:21:35.960
what happens with the radial
velocity method.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.214
Radial velocity method favors
small orbits,

00:21:38.214 --> 00:21:40.416
because in small orbits,
things go faster,

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:42.509
and you're looking at the
velocity.

00:21:42.509 --> 00:21:49.046
So, this favors big orbits,
and that's the opposite of

00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:55.802
radial velocity measurements.
And it also favors massive

00:21:55.802 --> 00:22:02.345
planets: the more massive the
planet, the better off you'll

00:22:02.345 --> 00:22:08.549
be, which is the same as the
radial velocity method.

00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:10.715
And so, this is useful,
one of the--if you're trying to

00:22:10.715 --> 00:22:12.640
figure out what kinds of things
are out there,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.447
it's helpful to be looking with
several different methods,

00:22:16.447 --> 00:22:20.121
which select for different
kinds of objects that you can

00:22:20.121 --> 00:22:23.393
look for.
And so, you can call these

00:22:23.393 --> 00:22:25.888
selection effects.
And, you know,

00:22:25.888 --> 00:22:29.000
if you're looking at radial
velocities, you're going to miss

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.942
all the large orbit stars.
And so, it would be nice to

00:22:32.942 --> 00:22:38.034
also look with astrometry,
so that you can see other kinds

00:22:38.034 --> 00:22:41.250
of stars--other kinds of
planets.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.434
Now, let's see.
The astrometry method has one

00:22:46.434 --> 00:22:54.579
other feature that it
needs--star needs to be nearby.

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:58.345
This is a--this is a question
that doesn't arise in radial

00:22:58.345 --> 00:23:01.120
velocity, and it's because of
this term.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:04.740
It's because of this term here.
You're looking for alpha.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.335
So, even once you figure it
out, how much the star moves,

00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:11.609
you've got to divide by the
distance of the star.

00:23:11.609 --> 00:23:14.680
So, for example,
if you're looking at something

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.685
10 parsecs away instead of 1
parsec away then you've got only

00:23:18.685 --> 00:23:21.875
1/10 the effect.
And so, while people sitting on

00:23:21.875 --> 00:23:24.630
Alpha Centauri can see the
effect of Jupiter,

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.830
people ten times further away,
on some other star,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.900
which is still quite close in
galactic terms,

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.771
would not be able to see that
exact same effect even though,

00:23:33.771 --> 00:23:36.643
of course, the Sun's moving the
same way regardless of who's

00:23:36.643 --> 00:23:39.142
looking at it.
The further away you get,

00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:43.244
the smaller the effect becomes.
That's why nobody's--largely,

00:23:43.244 --> 00:23:47.571
I think, that's why nobody has
successfully used the astrometry

00:23:47.571 --> 00:23:50.061
effect,
because it only works out well

00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:52.868
on very nearby stars,
and there's just a limited

00:23:52.868 --> 00:23:57.570
number of those to look at.
And so, let me summarize all

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:01.519
these different methods now--oh
good.

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:04.862
By just making a little table
of the so-called selection

00:24:04.862 --> 00:24:05.470
effects.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:14.490
These are what kinds of things
are easy to see and what kinds

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.809
of things are not so easy to see
for a given method.

00:24:18.809 --> 00:24:21.456
And we've got three different
methods, so let's make a little

00:24:21.456 --> 00:24:23.200
table here.
Method;

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.259
what kind of orbits get picked
out;

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:29.780
what kind of planets get picked
for a given orbit;

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:34.230
and other considerations.
And here we go.

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.440
So, the first one we talked
about was radial velocities.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:47.108
This is the Doppler shift,
and this picks out short or

00:24:47.108 --> 00:24:50.656
small orbits.
Short if you're thinking about

00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:53.897
the period, small if you're
thinking about the semi-major

00:24:53.897 --> 00:24:56.140
axis,
because the smaller the orbit,

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.990
the faster the planet has to
go, and therefore,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.319
the faster the star has to
respond.

00:25:01.319 --> 00:25:06.005
It picks out massive planets,
because the more massive the

00:25:06.005 --> 00:25:10.279
planet, the greater the reflex
motion of the star.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:14.761
And you'll recall that it does
make a difference how the thing

00:25:14.761 --> 00:25:20.694
is oriented.
If it's less than edge-on you

00:25:20.694 --> 00:25:29.827
see only part of the motion,
so it helps a little to be

00:25:29.827 --> 00:25:35.092
close to edge-on.
Now, for the next method,

00:25:35.092 --> 00:25:38.857
which are transits,
where the star gets in the way,

00:25:38.857 --> 00:25:42.547
this criteria that you have to
be edge-on is much,

00:25:42.547 --> 00:25:46.058
much more important.
Because, in the case of the

00:25:46.058 --> 00:25:48.412
radial velocity,
you know, if you're not

00:25:48.412 --> 00:25:51.247
edge-on, it sort of gradually
becomes a smaller,

00:25:51.247 --> 00:25:53.480
and smaller,
and smaller effect.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.784
But gradually,
there's no big moment where you

00:25:56.784 --> 00:26:00.183
can't see it at all.
But with transits,

00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:04.839
if you're not edge-on,
you don't see anything.

00:26:04.839 --> 00:26:08.864
It's not that the effect gets
smaller, it's that the effect

00:26:08.864 --> 00:26:13.236
disappears altogether if you're
not sufficiently edge-on so that

00:26:13.236 --> 00:26:17.469
the planet gets away--gets in
the way of your line of sight to

00:26:17.469 --> 00:26:23.843
the star.
This also favors short or small

00:26:23.843 --> 00:26:27.160
orbits.
But--and that's because it has

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:30.886
to be edge-on.
How close to edge-on you have

00:26:30.886 --> 00:26:36.020
to be depends on how far the
star is from the planet.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.031
Here's what I mean.
Here's the star and here's

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:46.654
the--here's you.
And, supposing there's a planet

00:26:46.654 --> 00:26:53.109
here, then that will just get in
the way.

00:26:53.109 --> 00:26:56.650
But if there's a planet here a
little further away on that

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.756
same--in the same kind of orbit,
only more distant,

00:26:59.756 --> 00:27:05.715
then it doesn't get in the way.
And so more distant--let me

00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:14.005
phrase that differently.
Larger semi-major axis makes it

00:27:14.005 --> 00:27:19.740
harder to have a transit.
You have to--closer to edge-on.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.390
If you were out here,
you'd have to--see here,

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:28.420
anything within this little
angle here will cause a transit.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:32.394
But if you're out here,
let's see, it would have to be

00:27:32.394 --> 00:27:35.170
anything within this smaller
angle.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.415
Does that make sense?
Yeah, it's just,

00:27:44.415 --> 00:27:49.183
the further away you hold your
thumb from your eye,

00:27:49.183 --> 00:27:55.000
the less you have to move your
arm to cover a given thing.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.527
All right.
And also, in this case,

00:27:57.527 --> 00:28:00.755
for transits,
let's see, the planet has to be

00:28:00.755 --> 00:28:03.910
large, physically,
in terms of its size.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.963
And so, it's not so much the
mass, but the size of the thing

00:28:06.963 --> 00:28:09.136
that matters.
So, if you have a big,

00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:11.485
but light, planet,
a big fluffy thing,

00:28:11.485 --> 00:28:15.104
that'll work well for transits,
but not so well for radial

00:28:15.104 --> 00:28:17.346
velocities.
Then, finally,

00:28:17.346 --> 00:28:22.689
this astrometry method I just
described favors large orbits in

00:28:22.689 --> 00:28:27.354
contrast to the other effects.
It is irrelevant whether it's

00:28:27.354 --> 00:28:30.475
edge-on, because if it's
face-on, then the star goes

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:32.556
around in a circle,
like this, and,

00:28:32.556 --> 00:28:34.584
you can see it.
If it's edge-on,

00:28:34.584 --> 00:28:36.695
the star goes around in a
circle like this,

00:28:36.695 --> 00:28:39.661
and you see it moving back and
forth as if it was in a line,

00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:44.469
so you can do it either way.
So, that's irrelevant,

00:28:44.469 --> 00:28:49.910
but has to be nearby--must be
nearby.

00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:54.390
And, like the radial velocity
method, you favor massive

00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:57.804
planets.
So, these are three of the

00:28:57.804 --> 00:29:01.980
methods that are commonly being
used now.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:03.776
Yes, question?
Student: So,

00:29:03.776 --> 00:29:06.544
does the orbit have to be
larger between methods so that

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:08.910
the center of mass is
sufficiently far away?

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:09.519
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Yes.

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:11.200
So the--yes,
that's exactly right.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.738
The orbit has to be large so
that the center of mass has to

00:29:14.738 --> 00:29:17.240
be sufficiently far away from
the star,

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.520
so that it travels a big enough
distance to be able to see.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.060
That's exactly right.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.641
There's one more method that's
commonly in use called

00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:31.589
"microlensing," which is really
cool,

00:29:31.589 --> 00:29:35.039
but I'm not going to talk about
it, because it's a relativistic

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:38.099
method and so we haven't talked
about relativity yet.

00:29:38.099 --> 00:29:42.269
We'll cycle back and talk about
this later on in the course.

00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:45.881
And this has actually worked,
and I will restrain myself from

00:29:45.881 --> 00:29:49.191
trying to explain it in the
remaining fifteen minutes of

00:29:49.191 --> 00:29:51.720
this particular segment of the
course.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.514
We'll come back to it.
But this sort of set of

00:29:55.514 --> 00:29:58.554
selection effects is a good
thing to know,

00:29:58.554 --> 00:30:01.232
because then,
if you do all of these things

00:30:01.232 --> 00:30:04.115
and you compare them to each
other, and each method has a

00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:07.544
different selection effect,
then you have a fighting chance

00:30:07.544 --> 00:30:11.252
of figuring out what's actually
out there rather than what you

00:30:11.252 --> 00:30:14.961
are simply able to see because
of the particular method you're

00:30:14.961 --> 00:30:17.082
using.
S,o it's a good idea to be

00:30:17.082 --> 00:30:19.430
trying to do all of these things
at once.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:26.918
Okay, let me end this segment
by talking about some space

00:30:26.918 --> 00:30:30.930
missions--yes,
question yes?

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.280
Student: So essentially
there's--if there's a similar

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.113
tech--people of technology
somewhere out there,

00:30:35.113 --> 00:30:36.070
they can't see this?

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.621
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We can--yes,

00:30:41.621 --> 00:30:44.746
so there--if there's people
elsewhere with our technology,

00:30:44.746 --> 00:30:48.403
they can't detect the Earth.
That is the same as saying we

00:30:48.403 --> 00:30:51.030
can't detect Earths around other
stars.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:55.995
That is the case right now.
However, technology marches on,

00:30:55.995 --> 00:30:58.798
and, as I'll show you,
in ten, fifteen years,

00:30:58.798 --> 00:31:02.853
that may no longer be true.
So, if the aliens out there are

00:31:02.853 --> 00:31:06.240
even fifteen years further
advanced than we are in

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.490
technology, they might know that
we're here.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.064
Other questions, yes?
Student: Even supposing

00:31:12.064 --> 00:31:14.099
that we could detect the Earth
around another star,

00:31:14.099 --> 00:31:17.524
would the presence of a more
massive planet sort of mess that

00:31:17.524 --> 00:31:19.991
up so that we can't?
Professor Charles

00:31:19.991 --> 00:31:23.748
Bailyn: Would the presence
of a more massive planet disrupt

00:31:23.748 --> 00:31:26.900
our potential detections of an
Earth-like planet?

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.314
Not necessarily.
Remember, I showed you

00:31:29.314 --> 00:31:32.563
that--the radial velocity curves
where they had detected several

00:31:32.563 --> 00:31:35.390
planets in the same system?
What you do is you take the

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.093
effect of the massive planet,
you figure out what the mass

00:31:38.093 --> 00:31:40.180
and orientation of the massive
planet is,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:43.178
and you remove that from your
data and then you look for the

00:31:43.178 --> 00:31:45.509
little wiggles left over.
And you could do that

00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:47.289
effectively with any of these
methods.

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:49.969
The example I showed was the
radial velocity thing,

00:31:49.969 --> 00:31:52.220
where there were superposed
sine curves,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.009
but you could also do it--there
could be three different

00:31:55.009 --> 00:31:57.900
transits, and so you'd get a big
lump for the big star,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:31:59.509
and then a little lump for the
little star.

00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:01.584
And if the little star's
closer, you'd get them more

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:02.575
often.
And, similarly,

00:32:02.575 --> 00:32:04.438
in astrometry,
you could get it moving back

00:32:04.438 --> 00:32:06.079
and forth due to a massive
planet,

00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:09.490
and then a motion on top of
that due to some other planet.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:14.193
So it--for--in all of these
cases the effect of one massive

00:32:14.193 --> 00:32:19.140
planet could be taken out so
that you could see the result.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:21.777
Now, what's perhaps more
important is,

00:32:21.777 --> 00:32:25.912
the presence of the massive
planet could screw up the orbit

00:32:25.912 --> 00:32:29.503
of the Earth-like planet.
This whole migration idea--this

00:32:29.503 --> 00:32:32.059
Jupiter comes cruising into the
Inner Solar System,

00:32:32.059 --> 00:32:35.378
and then us earthlings are in
trouble because our orbit gets

00:32:35.378 --> 00:32:37.460
disrupted and we fall into the
Sun,

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.911
or something like that.
So, the bigger problem is not

00:32:39.911 --> 00:32:41.998
detecting it,
but whether it permits the

00:32:41.998 --> 00:32:45.110
planet to be there at all.
Other questions?

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.313
Yes?
Student: Will we get our

00:32:47.313 --> 00:32:48.337
problem sets back?
Professor Charles

00:32:48.337 --> 00:32:48.980
Bailyn: Will you get your
problem set back?

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.570
Yes, that's an easy question,
end of the class.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.579
Other questions?
Yeah.

00:32:55.579 --> 00:32:57.962
Student: Will you be
posting the slides before the

00:32:57.962 --> 00:32:59.362
test?
Professor Charles

00:32:59.362 --> 00:33:02.173
Bailyn: We'll post these
slides before the test,

00:33:02.173 --> 00:33:04.799
yes, yeah.
Other things, yes?

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:07.500
Student: Why is it that
when you calculate a it's

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.940
not actually--this was the
method you were just doing,

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.567
the astrometry method--why is
it not 2a because it's

00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:15.150
going from one side of the
center of mass to the other?

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:17.558
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:33:17.558 --> 00:33:21.000
the--a is defined as the
semi-major axis.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.742
It's just a definition thing.
Student: But isn't the

00:33:23.742 --> 00:33:24.904
star going [inaudible]
Professor Charles

00:33:24.904 --> 00:33:27.289
Bailyn: Yes,
so the star travels a circle

00:33:27.289 --> 00:33:29.880
with radius a,
so you're right.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.131
It goes from one side to the
other, so the distance the star

00:33:33.131 --> 00:33:36.328
goes is actually 2a. And
so that's just a definition

00:33:36.328 --> 00:33:39.690
question of-- Student:
But is it--can't you observe the

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:42.153
star at one point or another?
Professor Charles

00:33:42.153 --> 00:33:42.980
Bailyn: Yes,
you're right.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.228
So that the total angular
change is--you're right,

00:33:46.228 --> 00:33:49.932
is actually 2a.
And what I was calculating

00:33:49.932 --> 00:33:54.157
there is the radius of the
little circle that it goes

00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:56.536
around.
But you're absolutely right

00:33:56.536 --> 00:33:59.959
the--in fact the distance--it's
like for the radial velocity

00:33:59.959 --> 00:34:01.938
method,
the actual change in radial

00:34:01.938 --> 00:34:05.201
velocity is from the peak to the
trough, but the number we quote

00:34:05.201 --> 00:34:07.170
is the amplitude of the sine
curve,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:13.280
so you're right about that.
Other questions?

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.445
Okay, let me show you some
things in--work in progress,

00:34:18.445 --> 00:34:23.611
and in particular space
missions that are being planned

00:34:23.611 --> 00:34:28.931
to explore this further.
So, the first of these is the

00:34:28.931 --> 00:34:33.576
so-called Kepler Mission,
which is going to look for

00:34:33.576 --> 00:34:36.798
transits.
I showed you the Hubble Space

00:34:36.798 --> 00:34:39.660
Telescope, transit curve,
which is much,

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:43.769
much better than anything you
can do from the ground.

00:34:43.769 --> 00:34:46.699
So, obviously the place to look
for transits is in space.

00:34:46.699 --> 00:34:49.903
From space you could see
transits the size of Earths--of

00:34:49.903 --> 00:34:52.815
planets the size of Earth,
whereas from the ground,

00:34:52.815 --> 00:34:54.969
you wouldn't be able to see
that.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.407
And also--and so what they want
to do is send up a mission

00:34:58.407 --> 00:35:02.146
that's going to do nothing but
make high precision measurements

00:35:02.146 --> 00:35:04.739
of stars in order to look for
transits.

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:07.504
So, the problem with the space
telescope is everybody wants to

00:35:07.504 --> 00:35:09.805
use it for all kinds of things.
There's relatively

00:35:09.805 --> 00:35:12.670
little--limited amounts of time
for any one particular project.

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:16.123
It's also not perfectly
designed for making these kinds

00:35:16.123 --> 00:35:19.361
of transits observations,
so this is going to be a

00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:23.202
mission which is set up for the
express purpose of making very

00:35:23.202 --> 00:35:27.170
high precision measurements of
the brightness of stars over,

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.989
and over, and over again.
And the problem with this is

00:35:30.989 --> 00:35:35.401
just the general problem with
transits: that you only see the

00:35:35.401 --> 00:35:38.409
ones that are edge-on.
So, you've got to look at lots

00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:40.718
and lots of stars.
Even if lots of them have

00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:43.289
planets, you'll only see a few
transits.

00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:45.627
But this is designed to carry
out that mission,

00:35:45.627 --> 00:35:48.219
so they're going to be lots of
transits observed,

00:35:48.219 --> 00:35:51.738
including transits from
Earth-like--from Earth-sized

00:35:51.738 --> 00:35:53.726
stars.
So, this will be the first

00:35:53.726 --> 00:35:56.929
moment when this thing gets
launched that we'll really have

00:35:56.929 --> 00:36:00.409
a good handle on being able to
detect an Earth-sized planet.

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:03.625
So, if the aliens have launched
their equivalent of Kepler,

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:05.510
they're looking at us right
now,

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:09.016
provided our Solar System
happens to be exactly edge-on

00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:12.651
from their perspective.
This is due to launch in a year

00:36:12.651 --> 00:36:14.539
or two.
It's under construction.

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:17.674
It's ready to roll,
and this thing will be up in

00:36:17.674 --> 00:36:21.343
space taking data by the
time--within the next couple of

00:36:21.343 --> 00:36:24.096
years.
So, that's an exciting thing to

00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:27.081
look forward to.
A little bit further into the

00:36:27.081 --> 00:36:30.128
future is something called SIM,
this is the Space

00:36:30.128 --> 00:36:33.429
Interferometry Mission,
and this does astrometry.

00:36:33.429 --> 00:36:37.659
And it's going to improve the
accuracy of positions of stars

00:36:37.659 --> 00:36:41.190
from what we now have,
which is in the milli-arc

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.870
second range,
1/1000 of an arc second,

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:49.389
to the micro-arc second range,
1/1,000,000 of an arc second.

00:36:49.389 --> 00:36:54.533
And again, as we just did in
that little calculation,

00:36:54.533 --> 00:36:58.984
that will, in principle,
enable us to look for

00:36:58.984 --> 00:37:03.115
Earth-like systems.
Now, the limitation on this is

00:37:03.115 --> 00:37:06.951
that--is this business that for
astrometry, you have to look at

00:37:06.951 --> 00:37:09.240
nearby stars,
and the nearer the star,

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.428
the better.
And if you get far out into

00:37:12.428 --> 00:37:16.581
these--into the galaxy,
then the method becomes less

00:37:16.581 --> 00:37:19.193
sensitive.
It's also true that,

00:37:19.193 --> 00:37:23.774
you know, this method favors
long orbits, and space missions

00:37:23.774 --> 00:37:26.570
tend not to last for forty
years.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.884
And so, if you're looking for
Neptune, which has,

00:37:29.884 --> 00:37:32.440
you know, a many-decade-long
orbit,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.894
it's not clear that this is
going to be around for long

00:37:34.894 --> 00:37:36.940
enough to actually make those
measurements.

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.335
So, this astrometry thing is
kind of squeezed between the

00:37:40.335 --> 00:37:43.487
requirement of the method to
have long orbits and the

00:37:43.487 --> 00:37:46.943
requirement of human beings to
get results in a relatively

00:37:46.943 --> 00:37:49.439
short amount of time.
Nevertheless,

00:37:49.439 --> 00:37:53.142
this will be a factor of a
thousand improvement over what

00:37:53.142 --> 00:37:56.670
we can do from the ground.
This mission is authorized.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.109
It's kind of under
construction,

00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:00.755
but it's one of those things
where it's going to launch in

00:38:00.755 --> 00:38:03.798
five to seven years.
That was also true five to

00:38:03.798 --> 00:38:06.716
seven years ago.
And it will probably--on our

00:38:06.716 --> 00:38:10.265
pessimistic days we think it
will still be true five to seven

00:38:10.265 --> 00:38:12.894
years from now.
It's always five years in the

00:38:12.894 --> 00:38:15.807
future, both for technical
reasons, and for funding and

00:38:15.807 --> 00:38:18.821
political reasons.
But there's some feeling that

00:38:18.821 --> 00:38:22.650
one of these days they'll
actually get around to doing it.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:25.893
But it's certainly further in
the future than the Kepler

00:38:25.893 --> 00:38:28.736
Mission is.
And then, the great granddaddy

00:38:28.736 --> 00:38:32.680
of all planet missions is
something called the Terrestrial

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.480
Planet Finder,
the TPF.

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.828
This is a huge NASA commitment,
and they want to directly image

00:38:39.828 --> 00:38:42.107
the planet.
So, this is fundamentally

00:38:42.107 --> 00:38:44.928
different from everything else.
This is--we're going to

00:38:44.928 --> 00:38:48.070
actually take a picture of the
light from the planet.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.642
We're going to give up this
silly business of observing the

00:38:50.642 --> 00:38:52.550
star to infer the presence of
the planet.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:54.980
We're actually going to look at
the planet itself.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.510
In order to do that,
you have to get rid of the

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:00.257
light from the star.
You have to blank out the light

00:39:00.257 --> 00:39:03.283
of the star, because otherwise,
as we saw, it'll drown out the

00:39:03.283 --> 00:39:04.966
planet.
And there are a couple of

00:39:04.966 --> 00:39:09.329
different ways you can do it.
One is basically just masking.

00:39:09.329 --> 00:39:13.779
You just put a big opaque thing
somewhere in the optical path of

00:39:13.779 --> 00:39:16.524
the telescope,
and it just blocks out the

00:39:16.524 --> 00:39:19.317
light of the star,
but it's carefully sized so

00:39:19.317 --> 00:39:22.670
that the light of stuff around
it can still get in.

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:25.335
There are also more
sophisticated optical

00:39:25.335 --> 00:39:28.199
methods--something called
interferometry,

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:31.163
which I won't explain right
now, which can have the same

00:39:31.163 --> 00:39:33.750
effect of nulling out the light
from the star.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.920
And so, we then observe the
planetary light directly.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.942
The best way to do this is not
in optical light but in

00:39:39.942 --> 00:39:42.776
infrared.
Optical light is where stars

00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:46.911
give out most of their light.
Planets give out most of their

00:39:46.911 --> 00:39:49.259
light in the infrared.
You may be aware,

00:39:49.259 --> 00:39:52.401
we all glow in the dark,
but we glow in the dark in the

00:39:52.401 --> 00:39:54.593
infrared,
that's why the military uses

00:39:54.593 --> 00:39:57.579
those interesting infrared
goggles, which turn everything

00:39:57.579 --> 00:40:00.568
green.
What those do is they take

00:40:00.568 --> 00:40:05.489
infrared photons and they ingest
infrared photons.

00:40:05.489 --> 00:40:08.847
And they emit green light so
that you can see infrared,

00:40:08.847 --> 00:40:12.079
and that's how they do these
night vision goggles.

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:15.230
And that's because at the
temperatures on ordinary

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.480
planets, we glow in the
infrared,

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:20.969
which is why you don't see each
other glowing in the dark,

00:40:20.969 --> 00:40:23.539
because your eyes don't detect
infrared.

00:40:23.539 --> 00:40:25.582
But if you're going to be
looking for planets,

00:40:25.582 --> 00:40:28.396
you're much better off looking
in the infrared than in ordinary

00:40:28.396 --> 00:40:30.252
light.
And then, once you can see the

00:40:30.252 --> 00:40:32.449
light from a planet,
you get to do a really cool

00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:34.807
thing,
which is, you get to examine

00:40:34.807 --> 00:40:39.028
the spectrum of that planet to
find out what the atmosphere is

00:40:39.028 --> 00:40:41.687
made of.
And we talked a little bit

00:40:41.687 --> 00:40:45.702
about spectral features,
which come from different atoms

00:40:45.702 --> 00:40:48.503
or molecules.
And once you actually see the

00:40:48.503 --> 00:40:51.940
light from the planet as opposed
to the light from the star,

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.915
you can actually study in
detail what that star's--what

00:40:54.915 --> 00:40:57.010
that planet's atmosphere is made
of.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.430
This, by the way,
is how one goes about detecting

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.986
life on planet Earth.
There was a very cute

00:41:02.986 --> 00:41:05.885
experiment a little while ago.
They were sending a mission to

00:41:05.885 --> 00:41:08.873
Jupiter, the Galileo Mission,
which is now at Jupiter doing

00:41:08.873 --> 00:41:11.107
science.
But the way they did it was

00:41:11.107 --> 00:41:13.571
funny.
They sent it not outward toward

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:15.800
Jupiter, but inward toward
Venus.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.755
It took a swing around Venus.
It turns out,

00:41:17.755 --> 00:41:20.300
if you do it right,
and you swing around a planet,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.405
you can pick up extra speed.
And so, to get this thing out

00:41:23.405 --> 00:41:25.571
to Jupiter, they had it swing
around Venus,

00:41:25.571 --> 00:41:28.150
then come back to Earth and
swing around Earth.

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.054
And each time it did one of
these swings,

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:32.340
it picked up speed,
so it got to Jupiter actually

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:35.150
faster that way--a very clever
bit of orbital dynamics.

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.983
But the consequence of it was
that this mission,

00:41:37.983 --> 00:41:41.479
one of our prime missions to
look at other planets with all

00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:45.096
the various instruments that we
like to look at other planets

00:41:45.096 --> 00:41:47.710
with,
swung by near to Earth.

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:50.940
And so, somebody had the very
clever idea, let's use our

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.346
standard suite of exploration
instruments and see if we can

00:41:54.346 --> 00:41:57.458
detect the existence of life on
Earth using one of the

00:41:57.458 --> 00:42:00.689
satellites that we used to
explore the rest of the Solar

00:42:00.689 --> 00:42:02.656
System.
And people had all kinds of

00:42:02.656 --> 00:42:04.710
thoughts about what would be
detectable--you know,

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:06.894
cities at night,
you know, you would be able to

00:42:06.894 --> 00:42:10.004
see lights on the dark side,
the Great Wall of China,

00:42:10.004 --> 00:42:12.320
you would be able to
detect--no.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:16.867
Turns out that the strongest
sign of life on Earth is the

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:20.440
fact that the atmosphere
contains methane.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.940
Now, the atmosphere,
of course, has a lot of oxygen.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.886
Methane, you may recall,
is CH4, and if you put a little

00:42:26.886 --> 00:42:29.779
bit of methane into an oxygen
atmosphere it immediately

00:42:29.779 --> 00:42:32.887
dissociates and you get water
and carbon dioxide because of

00:42:32.887 --> 00:42:35.640
all the free oxygen.
So there shouldn't be any

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.761
methane in the atmosphere,
but there is,

00:42:37.761 --> 00:42:40.808
and you can detect it by
looking at the infrared spectrum

00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:43.187
of the atmosphere.
Now, what does it mean that

00:42:43.187 --> 00:42:44.650
there's methane in our
atmosphere?

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:48.315
It means there's a continuous
source of methane pumping into

00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:51.680
the atmosphere all the time.
What is the source of that

00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.114
methane?
It is, as Carl Sagan,

00:42:54.114 --> 00:42:57.580
delicately put it,
bovine flatulence.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.496
Cow farts.
And just digestion,

00:43:00.496 --> 00:43:04.626
in general, has an output of
methane, which is continually

00:43:04.626 --> 00:43:08.237
piping into the atmosphere.
And if that weren't happening,

00:43:08.237 --> 00:43:10.967
that happens from biological
activity, and if that weren't

00:43:10.967 --> 00:43:12.976
happening,
there wouldn't be any methane

00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:15.401
observable in the atmosphere.
So, what you do is,

00:43:15.401 --> 00:43:18.531
if you find some other planet,
if you look at the atmospheric

00:43:18.531 --> 00:43:20.677
chemistry,
and you see if there's

00:43:20.677 --> 00:43:24.814
something in there that's out of
equilibrium that could only be

00:43:24.814 --> 00:43:28.150
continually replenished by
biological activity.

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:32.355
And having both oxygen and
methane at the same time is one

00:43:32.355 --> 00:43:35.048
such indicator.
So, the hope would be that we

00:43:35.048 --> 00:43:37.230
could not only see the light
from the planet,

00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:40.255
but we'd be able to detect the
presence of biological activity

00:43:40.255 --> 00:43:42.225
as well.
So how do you go about doing

00:43:42.225 --> 00:43:45.289
this?
Bovine flatulence equals

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:51.196
life--words to live by.
Let's see, so here's how you do

00:43:51.196 --> 00:43:52.728
it.
You need to have very high

00:43:52.728 --> 00:43:54.687
resolution;
you need to be able to separate

00:43:54.687 --> 00:43:57.237
the light from the star,
from the light from the planet,

00:43:57.237 --> 00:43:58.860
to the greatest extent
possible.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.733
Turns out, the way you do this
is you have space telescopes

00:44:02.733 --> 00:44:06.451
spaced pretty widely apart.
That gives you the best handle

00:44:06.451 --> 00:44:09.255
on the resolution.
But they have to know where

00:44:09.255 --> 00:44:12.918
each other is to a precision
very substantially greater than

00:44:12.918 --> 00:44:16.269
the wavelength of the light that
they're observing.

00:44:16.269 --> 00:44:20.084
And so, they need to be able to
tell the distance apart of these

00:44:20.084 --> 00:44:23.717
things to tiny fractions of a
meter--"picometer metrology" is

00:44:23.717 --> 00:44:27.252
the technical word.
A picometer is 10^(-12) meters

00:44:27.252 --> 00:44:31.179
and metrology is just measuring
how far apart you are.

00:44:31.179 --> 00:44:34.642
So, they need to be able to
figure out--to formation fly,

00:44:34.642 --> 00:44:38.537
and know how far apart they are
to about the width of an atom or

00:44:38.537 --> 00:44:40.332
so.
You want to image in the

00:44:40.332 --> 00:44:43.216
infrared.
Mid-infrared imaging wants you

00:44:43.216 --> 00:44:47.122
to--pushes you beyond Jupiter.
The problem is that inside the

00:44:47.122 --> 00:44:49.441
orbit of Jupiter,
there's all this warm dust in

00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:51.844
our Solar System.
And so, it's like the sky is

00:44:51.844 --> 00:44:54.333
bright all the time from all the
infrared emission,

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:57.012
from the dust.
So, you've got to go out into

00:44:57.012 --> 00:45:00.110
the colder parts of the Solar
System to do this.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.577
So we're--what we're going to
do, the plan is,

00:45:02.577 --> 00:45:05.320
you're going to build a half
dozen or so things,

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.353
each of which is about ten
times the size of the space

00:45:08.353 --> 00:45:10.835
telescope.
We're going to move them out

00:45:10.835 --> 00:45:14.875
beyond Jupiter and formation fly
them in this--to this extremely

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:17.537
high precision.
This is not something we're

00:45:17.537 --> 00:45:20.544
capable of doing right now.
But there is a twenty-five

00:45:20.544 --> 00:45:22.831
year-old;
twenty-five year so-called

00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:25.695
roadmap, a series of missions
along the way,

00:45:25.695 --> 00:45:28.891
which is going to
simultaneously be good missions

00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:32.030
in their own right,
and develop the technology.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.383
SIM is one of these missions.
It's going to develop the high

00:45:36.383 --> 00:45:39.539
precision spatial imaging that
you need for this.

00:45:39.539 --> 00:45:43.986
JWST is the acronym for the
next-generation space telescope,

00:45:43.986 --> 00:45:46.849
which is due to be launched in
2012.

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:50.724
That's basically one such
telescope, but orbiting the

00:45:50.724 --> 00:45:52.420
Earth.
That's a milestone.

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.230
And there are various other
milestones along this roadmap.

00:45:55.230 --> 00:45:57.942
And the hope is that in
twenty-five years,

00:45:57.942 --> 00:46:00.588
with, you know,
25 to 50 billion dollars,

00:46:00.588 --> 00:46:02.969
we could actually do this
thing.

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:06.684
And so, here's the little
artist's conception of these

00:46:06.684 --> 00:46:10.820
guys flying in formation outside
of the orbit of Jupiter.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.207
Then, I guess this represents
the Sun down in the middle of

00:46:13.207 --> 00:46:15.647
the Solar System.
They're looking out this way,

00:46:15.647 --> 00:46:19.516
finding life on other planets.
And the big problem with this

00:46:19.516 --> 00:46:23.852
whole mission is that it's been
cancelled, because a decision

00:46:23.852 --> 00:46:27.250
has been made that it's--this is
a very big,

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.083
expensive mission,
and the decision has been made

00:46:29.083 --> 00:46:31.260
that if you're going to do
something big and expensive,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:32.750
you ought to go to Mars,
instead.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:36.237
Put people on Mars, instead.
However, this is a twenty-five

00:46:36.237 --> 00:46:38.733
year time scale.
Things get cancelled and

00:46:38.733 --> 00:46:42.442
un-cancelled every three or four
years, so, who knows exactly

00:46:42.442 --> 00:46:46.207
what's going to happen.
And I think this may reappear

00:46:46.207 --> 00:46:49.630
in the NASA plan at some point
in the future.

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:54.444
And that's sort of the ultimate
that people can think of now in

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:58.559
terms of find--studying planets
around other stars.

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:02.725
Okay, that's what I got to say
about this, and a test on

00:47:02.725 --> 00:47:03.725
Thursday.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.210
Prof: Good morning
everyone.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.720
Augustus founded the
Julio-Claudian dynasty.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.494
The name says it all:
Julio-Claudian,

00:00:10.494 --> 00:00:14.888
Julio for the Julian side of
the family, Julius Caesar and

00:00:14.888 --> 00:00:18.896
Augustus;
the Claudian for the Claudian

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:20.970
side of the family.
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.652
That was Augustus' wife
from--her side of the family,

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:31.570
excuse me, the Claudian side of
the family.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.840
And there were four emperors in
the Julio-Claudian dynasty.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.418
These were Tiberius,
Caligula, Claudius,

00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:41.710
and Nero.
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.612
Every one of them,
all four, made an important

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:48.160
contribution to the evolution of
Roman architecture,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.211
and we'll talk about the
contributions of those four

00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:51.690
today.
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.345
But we'll also see that the
single most important

00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:56.779
contribution,
from the standpoint of Roman

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:58.985
architecture,
was by Nero,

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:04.537
the notorious emperor Nero,
which is why I do call this

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:09.239
lecture "Notorious Nero and
His Amazing Architectural

00:01:09.239 --> 00:01:10.560
Legacy."
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.031
An architectural legacy that
would have been impossible

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:17.504
without some of the earlier
concrete constructions that

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:20.593
we've already discussed,
specifically the

00:01:20.593 --> 00:01:25.569
frigidaria of Pompeii and
also the thermal bath at Baia,

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.209
which I remind you of here.
 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.748
The so-called Temple of
Mercury, we see it again with

00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:33.605
its dome made out of concrete
construction,

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:35.580
a view from the exterior.
 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.105
And down here,
at the left,

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.569
a view of the interior of the
monument,

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:43.973
and I remind you of the way in
which is that designed so that

00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:48.010
light streams through the
oculus in the dome,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.279
down onto the sides of the
wall, creating light effects:

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:57.170
a circle that corresponds to
the shape of the opening above,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.929
and then falling initially on
the pool of water that would

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.688
have been located there,
as well as across the walls,

00:02:04.688 --> 00:02:07.019
which probably would have
been--

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.758
that were certainly stuccoed
over--and probably would have

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:12.530
been covered with mosaic.
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.818
So a very spectacular interior
indeed,

00:02:15.818 --> 00:02:18.530
and one again that had an
important impact,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.502
as we'll see,
on the architectural designs of

00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:24.758
the Roman emperor Nero.
 

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:27.604
I want to begin though with the
first of the Julio-Claudian

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.470
emperors, and that is with
Tiberius.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.242
And you see a portrait of
Tiberius now on the screen,

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:34.910
just to give you a sense of
what he looked like.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.089
Tiberius, again the son of
Livia by a former marriage,

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.479
the elder son of Livia by a
former marriage,

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:46.660
who becomes emperor of Rome
right after Augustus.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.453
And the portrait that you see
here is a marble portrait of

00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:53.980
Tiberius that is now in the Ny
Carlsberg Glyptothek in

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:54.979
Copenhagen.
 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:00.129
Tiberius was emperor of Rome
from 14 to 37 A.D.,

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.527
and with regard to
architecture,

00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:08.348
he completed projects begun by
Augustus.

00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:13.038
He also was responsible for
restoring Republican buildings

00:03:13.038 --> 00:03:17.479
that had fallen into severe
disrepair by his reign,

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:21.000
and this included several
temples, a basilica,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.590
warehouses, and also a theater.
 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.188
Tiberius also initiated some
new building projects in Rome.

00:03:29.188 --> 00:03:32.930
These included a Temple to the
Divine Augustus,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.419
Temple to Divus
Augustus,

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.209
his divine adoptive father,
because Augustus was made a

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.099
god, as Caesar had been before
him,

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.538
at his death.
 

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:47.873
Tiberius also put up a series
of arches to his relatives,

00:03:47.873 --> 00:03:51.970
and also a camp for the
Praetorian Guard.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.258
But what we'll see about
Tiberius is that his real

00:03:55.258 --> 00:03:59.020
passion was not the public
architecture that Augustus had

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.204
been so fond of--
think the Forum of Augustus and

00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:05.545
the Temple of Mars Ultor,
or the Ara Pacis Augustae,

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:09.758
which were among Augustus' most
important building projects.

00:04:09.758 --> 00:04:15.560
Tiberius was interested instead
in private architecture--

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.608
architecture in a sense for
himself and his nearest and

00:04:18.608 --> 00:04:21.951
dearest--
and he began a palace on the

00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:23.410
Palatine Hill.
 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.819
He did not think the small,
modest House of Augustus,

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:29.560
despite the fact that it had
those nicely painted walls,

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.189
he did not think that that
befit his own grandeur,

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.279
and he began a major palace on
the Palatine Hill,

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.740
on the northwest side of the
Palatine Hill.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.050
And he renovated and built
villas elsewhere,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.564
outside of Rome,
especially on the spectacular

00:04:48.564 --> 00:04:50.569
Island of Capri.
 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.259
And indeed, during the reign of
Augustus,

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:56.720
and also the reign of Tiberius,
that family,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.540
the Augustan and Julio-Claudian
family,

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.420
built twelve villas--count
them, twelve villas--

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.464
on the Island of Capri,
one more spectacular than the

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:08.009
next.
 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.521
It's worth mentioning,
by the way, that Augustus'

00:05:10.521 --> 00:05:13.189
taste, even in villas,
was somewhat more modest than

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.870
Tiberius.
 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.379
Augustus used to decorate his
villa,

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:18.891
we are told,
with dinosaur bones and things

00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:21.718
like that,
of historical interest,

00:05:21.718 --> 00:05:26.531
whereas Tiberius spared no
expense in introducing every

00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:29.649
luxury possible into his villas.
 

00:05:29.649 --> 00:05:33.754
With regard to the palace on
the Palatine Hill,

00:05:33.754 --> 00:05:38.928
the so-called Domus Tiberiana,
I just want to mention it in

00:05:38.928 --> 00:05:40.000
passing.
 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.096
There's very little that
survives of the substructures

00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:45.610
that Tiberius was responsible
for beginning,

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.779
for that palace.
 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.509
They were made out of concrete
construction,

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.709
and you can see here what's
called the Clivus Palatinus,

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:55.779
which is a ramp way leading
from the Roman Forum,

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.940
up to the Palatine Hill.
 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.079
And you can see some of the
remains of those substructures

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:01.740
over here.
 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.420
The ones that we see were
probably restored later and may

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.180
or may not date to the Tiberian
period,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.069
but they give you some idea of
the sort of construction that he

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.889
began on the Palatine Hill.
 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.317
And I mention this just because
we'll see that Caligula and some

00:06:17.317 --> 00:06:20.420
of the other emperors continued
to add to this palace,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.452
and then the entire Palatine
Hill is redesigned by the

00:06:24.452 --> 00:06:28.180
emperor Domitian in the late
first century A.D.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.911
Much more interesting and much
more--and there's much more

00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.708
information for us to look
at--are the villas on the island

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:36.560
of Capri.
 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.490
And I'm going to show you one,
the best preserved,

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.956
from that island,
the so-called Villa Jovis:

00:06:42.956 --> 00:06:45.894
the Villa Jovis,
the Villa of Jupiter,

00:06:45.894 --> 00:06:49.514
which is an interesting name,
when you think about it,

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:51.959
for a villa for the emperor
Tiberius.

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:55.357
The Villa Jovis,
which was put up sometime in

00:06:55.357 --> 00:06:58.600
the years in which Tiberius was
emperor;

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.790
that is, from 14 to 37 A.D.
 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.459
It's a spectacular place,
beautifully situated.

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:08.189
And I'm going to take you there
today.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.579
Now the only way to get to the
island of Capri,

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:13.490
which by the way is one of my
very favorite places in the

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.487
world;
I don't know how many of you've

00:07:15.487 --> 00:07:18.060
been there, but it's quite
extraordinary--the island of

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.490
Capri.
 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.240
You can't jet to the Island of
Capri,

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.470
you have to arrive there by
boat, and most people take a

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.716
boat,
unless they have a private

00:07:25.716 --> 00:07:28.110
yacht, but those of us who
don't,

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.670
have to take a boat either from
Naples,

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.160
usually a hydrofoil--although
they have larger boats as well--

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.639
a hydrofoil from Naples or from
Positano.

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.005
And I actually show you--this
is a view on the left-hand side

00:07:41.005 --> 00:07:43.699
of the screen of Positano on the
Amalfi Coast.

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.632
You go down to the beach;
there's a place where you can

00:07:46.632 --> 00:07:47.509
pick up a hydrofoil.
 

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.040
It takes a very short time,
half an hour or so,

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.899
less, a little bit less,
to get over to the Island of

00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:54.220
Capri from Positano.
 

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.490
So we're sitting on one of
those hydrofoils--

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.254
or at least eight of us are,
because that's usually what

00:07:58.254 --> 00:08:01.199
they fit--
and we're making our way from

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.230
Positano toward Capri.
 

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.620
As you go there,
if the weather is good enough,

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.906
and if the sea is calm enough,
they will take you to see the

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.891
famous grottos,
the Green Grotto and also the

00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:13.778
Blue Grotto.
 

00:08:13.778 --> 00:08:18.089
And again I can just give you a
little sense here of--in this

00:08:18.089 --> 00:08:20.100
view--of how blue is blue.
 

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.887
I mean, it's really a neon
blue, when you go to see the

00:08:22.887 --> 00:08:23.610
Blue Grotto.
 

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:27.307
It's a spectacular sight and a
very special color blue that you

00:08:27.307 --> 00:08:30.050
really don't see anywhere else
in the world.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.959
So they'll drive you around in
the hydrofoil to see the

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.840
grottos,
and then you eventually get to

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.273
the dock at Capri,
and this is what you see as you

00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:44.818
get off the boat at the island
of Capri: again a very beautiful

00:08:44.818 --> 00:08:46.340
spot to visit.
 

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.452
As you go up,
you make your way from the dock

00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:51.009
up to the funicular.
 

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:53.943
You take the funicular up to
the main part of town,

00:08:53.943 --> 00:08:57.759
and one of the first things you
see is the popular Bar Tiberio.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:00.725
I show it to you,
not to--it's a fun place to

00:09:00.725 --> 00:09:02.985
go--
but I show it to you mainly

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:06.904
because it's one of these
examples of the way in which the

00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:10.000
Roman emperors have had a
lasting impact,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.155
even today, that so many of
these bars and restaurants and

00:09:14.155 --> 00:09:17.000
so on are named for Rome's
emperors,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.755
or for some of the monuments
that we've been studying in the

00:09:18.755 --> 00:09:19.528
course of this semester.
 

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:22.703
And this bar is no exception,
and in fact if you go through

00:09:22.703 --> 00:09:25.548
the doors that lead into the
interior of the bar,

00:09:25.548 --> 00:09:30.629
you will see a portrait of
Tiberius etched on the doorway.

00:09:30.629 --> 00:09:36.601
So Tiberius very much lives and
thrives in the center of

00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:39.750
downtown Capri still today.
 

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:42.460
What most tourists go to Capri
to see,

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.285
besides just to walk around a
magnificent island and to test

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:48.046
out some of the beaches,
which tend to be on the rocky

00:09:48.046 --> 00:09:51.190
side,
is to see the most famous rocks

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:52.090
of Capri.
 

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.269
And these are the so-called
Faraglioni.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:55.519
You see them here.
 

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:59.408
You go up to the so-called
Gardens of Augustus,

00:09:59.408 --> 00:10:04.990
and then up to a spot where you
can see these particularly well.

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.970
They're magnificent.
 

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.990
They are the landmark spot on
the island of Capri,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:14.990
and they have survived coastal
landslides and sea erosion,

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.960
to look as wonderful as they
still do today.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.167
And this is,
of course, the photo op on the

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:21.639
island.
 

00:10:21.639 --> 00:10:24.793
I don't think there's anyone
who visits Capri who doesn't

00:10:24.793 --> 00:10:27.835
take a photo or have a photo
taken of themselves at the

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:28.678
Faraglioni.
 

00:10:28.678 --> 00:10:33.135
The villa that I want to show
you is again the best preserved

00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:35.288
villa of Tiberius on Capri.
 

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:38.822
And again I mentioned that it's
called the Villa Jovis,

00:10:38.822 --> 00:10:40.850
and it dates to 14 to 37 A.D.
 

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.909
It's a trek to get up there.
 

00:10:43.909 --> 00:10:46.710
You have to walk essentially.
 

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.245
The streets are such that there
are no cabs or cars that can get

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:52.110
you there.
 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:53.980
You have to make it on your own.
 

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.658
And there are two paths.
 

00:10:55.658 --> 00:10:58.769
I've made the mistake of taking
the more arduous path,

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:01.649
which looks like this,
to get up to the top,

00:11:01.649 --> 00:11:05.200
but there's another path also
that takes you by some very

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.590
attractive houses and villas,
which are fun to see.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:11.500
And you will see the largest
lemons--

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.629
has anyone ever been on the
island of Capri?--

00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:17.220
you'll see the largest lemons
on Capri,

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.970
as well as on the Amalfi Coast
in general,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.629
that you've ever seen anywhere:
gigantic lemons on lemon trees,

00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:31.048
as you make your way up to the
Villa of the Villa Jovis.

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:33.293
Now here is a plan of the Villa
Jovis, as well as a

00:11:33.293 --> 00:11:35.450
cross-section,
from the Ward-Perkins textbook.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.256
And if we look first at the
cross-section,

00:11:38.256 --> 00:11:42.091
at the uppermost part of the
screen, you will see the way

00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:43.940
this building was made.
 

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.960
You will see that the
architects have taken advantage

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.328
of developments in concrete
construction to create a series

00:11:50.328 --> 00:11:54.250
of barrel vaults in tiers,
and those barrel vaults in

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.842
tiers are where--
are the cisterns of the villa,

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:02.019
where the water was kept to
supply the baths and the kitchen

00:12:02.019 --> 00:12:04.519
and so on,
of the villa.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:07.980
You see those there,
and in this plan down here you

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.202
can see the cisterns again and
the way in which a pavement has

00:12:12.202 --> 00:12:16.080
been placed on top of those
tiers of barrel vaults,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.778
to create a very large court
here.

00:12:18.778 --> 00:12:23.950
The entranceway into Tiberius'
villa on Capri was over here.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:27.955
You can see a series of
columns, four in total,

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:33.178
that you see as you make your
way into the entranceway of the

00:12:33.178 --> 00:12:34.048
villa.
 

00:12:34.048 --> 00:12:37.635
Along this side of the villa,
which is the southern side of

00:12:37.635 --> 00:12:39.596
the villa,
you see the baths--not

00:12:39.596 --> 00:12:41.860
surprisingly placed on the
southern side--

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.779
extensive bath structure for
the emperor.

00:12:45.779 --> 00:12:52.403
On the western side you see a
series of rooms that are for the

00:12:52.403 --> 00:12:55.009
entourage of Tiberius.
 

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:58.210
The kitchen is located on this
side as well.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.330
And then perhaps the most
important room of the house,

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.399
from our standpoint,
the hall or the aula--

00:13:04.399 --> 00:13:09.158
a-u-l-a--the aula of
Tiberius' villa at Capri.

00:13:09.158 --> 00:13:11.658
And you can see the shape of
that aula.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:16.738
It's a kind of hemicycle with
large picture windows that allow

00:13:16.738 --> 00:13:18.820
views that lie outside.
 

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.114
And it should remind you of the
second phase of the Villa of the

00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:24.986
Mysteries in Pompeii,
where we also saw that

00:13:24.986 --> 00:13:28.590
attractive bay window with the
panoramic views,

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.870
out beyond.
 

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.931
The panoramic views were much
more spectacular here than even

00:13:33.931 --> 00:13:38.431
from the Villa of the Mysteries,
because as I think you can see

00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:42.284
also from this site plan,
that this is located right at

00:13:42.284 --> 00:13:44.019
the edge of a promontory.
 

00:13:44.019 --> 00:13:50.277
It's in fact 1,095 feet above
sea level, and you get some

00:13:50.277 --> 00:13:56.647
incredible views of the sea and
of other islands from this

00:13:56.647 --> 00:13:58.100
location.
 

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.062
On this side,
the northern side of the

00:14:01.062 --> 00:14:05.067
structure, is where the
apartments of Tiberius were

00:14:05.067 --> 00:14:07.808
located;
a series of rooms for the

00:14:07.808 --> 00:14:11.690
emperor himself,
and including also an imperial

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.831
loggia,
where he could walk out and get

00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:18.490
some attractive panoramas
privately on his own.

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.291
You can also see that there is
a corridor that leads from the

00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:25.269
private apartment to this very
long walkway,

00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:28.408
that is located right at the
edge of the cliff on this side.

00:14:28.408 --> 00:14:32.590
This is called technically an
ambulatio

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:37.327
--a-m-b-u-l-a-t-i-o,
an ambulatio--and it was

00:14:37.327 --> 00:14:39.000
just for that.
 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.172
It was for taking pleasant
walks, getting nice views of the

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:44.633
sea from there,
especially for the emperor and

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:46.110
special invited guests.
 

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.908
And right in the center was a
triclinium--

00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:53.393
you see it right here--a
triclinium or dining room

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:58.437
where the emperor could dine and
could look out again over views

00:14:58.437 --> 00:15:02.519
that were possible from this
particular locale.

00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:07.028
This is a view unfortunately in
black and white,

00:15:07.028 --> 00:15:09.793
but it's the only one that I
have that gives you a sense of

00:15:09.793 --> 00:15:13.070
the remains today from above,
the extent of those remains.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.628
And you can see again the
concrete construction I think

00:15:16.628 --> 00:15:19.504
quite well from this,
as well as the fact that

00:15:19.504 --> 00:15:21.990
although all the foundation
walls are there,

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.519
there's no decoration,
the ceilings are missing,

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:26.639
and so on and so forth.
 

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:31.043
You see the cistern here,
the location of the aula

00:15:31.043 --> 00:15:34.738
up here, the area for the
entourage of Tiberius,

00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:38.120
and the private apartment on
that side.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.413
A church and a statue on a base
were added later,

00:15:41.413 --> 00:15:44.710
and so of course you need to
think those away.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.070
This is a view of some of the
remains as they look today,

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.548
just to give you a sense that
when you're actually up there

00:15:51.548 --> 00:15:53.048
and wandering around.
 

00:15:53.048 --> 00:15:57.220
The walls don't go up all that
far,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:03.304
but you can also see that they
do preserve the entire plan of

00:16:03.304 --> 00:16:06.086
the structure,
which is why we have such a

00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:08.394
good idea of what it looked like
in antiquity and how all of

00:16:08.394 --> 00:16:09.528
those pieces fit together.
 

00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:13.543
You can see that the
construction is concrete and the

00:16:13.543 --> 00:16:16.246
facing is stone,
irregular stonework,

00:16:16.246 --> 00:16:19.153
the kind of opus
incertum work that we've

00:16:19.153 --> 00:16:21.009
seen elsewhere in Campania.
 

00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:23.960
Because remember this is an
island, but it's off the coast

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.206
of Naples, Pompeii and Oplontis;
it is in that same general area

00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:29.009
of Italy.
 

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:32.745
And this is one view and one--I
have many more spectacular ones

00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:35.452
than this one--
but this is one that gives you

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:37.808
a sense of the sort of thing you
can see.

00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:40.302
This one I took right from,
I think from near the

00:16:40.302 --> 00:16:43.308
aula;
just to give you an idea of

00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:45.419
what you see from there.
 

00:16:45.419 --> 00:16:46.960
Beautiful views of the sea.
 

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:51.072
In some areas you can see the
rocky outcroppings as you look

00:16:51.072 --> 00:16:54.839
down, and then views of some
other islands in the area,

00:16:54.839 --> 00:16:57.210
for example Ischia,
and so on.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:04.788
The successor to Tiberius was a
man by the name of Caligula.

00:17:04.788 --> 00:17:11.118
Caligula became emperor at the
death of Tiberius.

00:17:11.118 --> 00:17:14.644
And we see a portrait of him
here, on the right-hand side of

00:17:14.644 --> 00:17:17.990
the screen, just again to give
you a sense of the man.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.662
He had a very short--he was
very young when he became

00:17:20.662 --> 00:17:23.900
emperor of Rome--he had a very
short reign, only three years.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.813
And he was somewhat unbalanced,
and it was not long after he

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:31.130
became emperor--oh,
by the way, he was very popular

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.690
when he was a boy;
he was a prince, very popular.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.769
He used to run around the
military camps with his family,

00:17:37.769 --> 00:17:41.444
in a little military costume,
and he wore these distinctive

00:17:41.444 --> 00:17:44.170
military boots called the
caliga,

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:47.230
c-a-l-i-g-a;
which is how he got the

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:50.000
nickname Caligula,
from those boots.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.732
He was extremely popular with
everyone, and everyone was quite

00:17:52.732 --> 00:17:54.569
excited when he became emperor
of Rome.

00:17:54.569 --> 00:17:58.038
But his power went to his head.
 

00:17:58.038 --> 00:18:00.324
He became a despot,
and he spent most of his time

00:18:00.324 --> 00:18:01.990
cavorting with his three
sisters.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:07.201
I show you them here on a coin,
and they're all named:

00:18:07.201 --> 00:18:10.303
Agrippina,
Julia, and--Drusilla was his

00:18:10.303 --> 00:18:12.026
favorite,
so of course she's in the

00:18:12.026 --> 00:18:13.730
center there--
Drusilla.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:18.452
And he also did strange things
like conduct faux wars

00:18:18.452 --> 00:18:23.266
essentially, faux wars with faux
enemies: for example,

00:18:23.266 --> 00:18:26.990
his war against Britain,
so to speak.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:31.708
And he also spent a good deal
of time trying to work it out so

00:18:31.708 --> 00:18:34.800
that his horse,
Incitatus, could become a

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.730
senator.
 

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.095
So this gives you some idea of
the kind of man we're dealing

00:18:39.095 --> 00:18:39.779
with here.
 

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:42.483
He was occupied with all of
that and really not that much

00:18:42.483 --> 00:18:43.450
with architecture.
 

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.018
And again, he was only emperor
for a very short time,

00:18:46.018 --> 00:18:48.489
so there was a limit to what
kinds of architectural

00:18:48.489 --> 00:18:50.069
contributions he could make.
 

00:18:50.069 --> 00:18:51.630
But he didn't make none.
 

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.257
I mean, he made some,
and in fact one of them is

00:18:54.257 --> 00:18:57.164
particularly important,
and I want to emphasize those

00:18:57.164 --> 00:18:58.058
to you here.
 

00:18:58.058 --> 00:19:02.730
So again, Caligula was emperor
between 37 and 41 A.D.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:04.828
He had little public building.
 

00:19:04.828 --> 00:19:08.226
Again, he continued the
tradition of Tiberius,

00:19:08.226 --> 00:19:12.452
and that is in having much more
interest in private villa

00:19:12.452 --> 00:19:15.848
architecture than in public
architecture.

00:19:15.848 --> 00:19:19.796
But again it's only fair--as we
judge him in terms of his

00:19:19.796 --> 00:19:23.007
architectural contribution,
I think it's only fair to

00:19:23.007 --> 00:19:25.463
remind ourselves that again he
was only emperor for three

00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:25.858
years.
 

00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:29.519
If he had been emperor longer,
perhaps his contribution would

00:19:29.519 --> 00:19:30.740
have been greater.
 

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.200
He did finish several
buildings, begun by Tiberius--

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.670
and we're going to see this as
a pattern,

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:39.345
that is, emperors coming to the
fore and completing buildings by

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.568
their predecessors.
 

00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:45.096
And he did build a couple of
new things, including two new

00:19:45.096 --> 00:19:50.098
aqueducts and a circus located
near what is now Vatican City.

00:19:50.098 --> 00:19:54.010
He thought the Domus Tiberiana
was a terrific idea and

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.890
consequently he added to that
palace;

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.653
that's the palace that Tiberius
began on the slopes of the

00:20:00.653 --> 00:20:01.710
Palatine Hill.
 

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:05.089
But his main interest was
villas outside Rome.

00:20:05.089 --> 00:20:06.670
He built a number of those.
 

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.259
I'm not talking about Capri
now, those were already built,

00:20:09.259 --> 00:20:12.278
and he could go down and enjoy
those as emperor of Rome,

00:20:12.278 --> 00:20:15.759
but he wanted to ring Rome with
a series of villas,

00:20:15.759 --> 00:20:17.400
and he began that work.
 

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.086
And later on,
according to Pliny the Elder,

00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:23.476
Rome was ringed with the
villas, not only of Caligula,

00:20:23.476 --> 00:20:24.818
but also of Nero.
 

00:20:24.818 --> 00:20:29.318
So these were going up apace
around the city of Rome itself.

00:20:29.318 --> 00:20:32.883
The single most important
contribution though that

00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:36.161
Caligula made,
and it is very significant,

00:20:36.161 --> 00:20:38.630
is to alter--
it was during his reign,

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.098
during his brief reign,
that the recipe for Roman

00:20:42.098 --> 00:20:44.900
concrete construction was
altered.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:50.230
What they did was make the
decision to lighten it up,

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.862
and they did that by taking the
stone rubble that had been used

00:20:53.862 --> 00:20:56.440
in the mixture of concrete for
some time,

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.009
taking that stone rubble and
dispensing with it,

00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:02.318
getting rid of it,
because it was too heavy,

00:21:02.318 --> 00:21:06.298
and mixed the liquid mortar
instead with a very porous,

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:09.528
yellow tufa,
and also with pumice,

00:21:09.528 --> 00:21:14.028
which is a soft light stone
resembling cork.

00:21:14.028 --> 00:21:17.648
So when you think of replacing
heavy rubble with something that

00:21:17.648 --> 00:21:20.276
resembles cork,
you get the sense that that is

00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:23.932
going to lead to lighter domes;
lighter domes are going to lead

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.380
to domes that are able to span
greater spaces.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.519
So this is no small
accomplishment.

00:21:28.519 --> 00:21:30.868
This is very, very significant.
 

00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:33.490
It happens during the reign of
Caligula,

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:37.224
and we'll see already today
that the so-called Golden House

00:21:37.224 --> 00:21:40.680
or Domus Aurea of Nero,
would not have been possible,

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:44.488
the span of that dome would not
have been possible without this

00:21:44.488 --> 00:21:48.480
change in the recipe in concrete
that happened under Caligula.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.535
The other development under
Caligula that I want to make

00:21:51.535 --> 00:21:54.980
reference to really has more to
do with religious practice,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.640
but it also has an important
impact on architecture,

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.009
and that is the impact of
mystery cults on Roman religion.

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:07.375
I think I've mentioned to you
already that the Romans

00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:10.355
practiced a state religion,
and that state religion was

00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:13.710
considered the religion that
everyone should adhere to.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:16.443
But over time,
because of Rome's connections

00:22:16.443 --> 00:22:21.265
to other parts of the empire,
especially the Eastern Empire,

00:22:21.265 --> 00:22:25.630
a whole host of different kinds
of religions,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.819
mystery religions,
exotic religions,

00:22:27.819 --> 00:22:30.278
began to infiltrate Rome.
 

00:22:30.278 --> 00:22:33.461
They came back through the
army, they came back through

00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:34.640
commerce, to Rome.
 

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.759
And initially they were not
accepted.

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:41.298
You were not allowed to
practice these openly.

00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:44.948
And so we saw an example with
the Villa of the Mysteries where

00:22:44.948 --> 00:22:47.880
the woman of the house created a
special room,

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.573
room number five,
for the celebration of the cult

00:22:52.573 --> 00:22:55.661
of Dionysus,
because that was considered a

00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:58.009
secret religion at that
particular point.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.979
But these mystery religions,
Caligula himself showed some

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:03.517
interest in them,
and it began to look as if

00:23:03.517 --> 00:23:06.356
perhaps they would be able to
begin to come up from

00:23:06.356 --> 00:23:07.210
underground.
 

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:10.938
They didn't during his reign,
but I think again his

00:23:10.938 --> 00:23:14.890
contribution in that way was
also an important one.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.180
They did continue to have to
meet in secret.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.868
And one sect in particular I
want to make reference to today,

00:23:20.868 --> 00:23:23.608
the so-called Neo-Pythagorean
sect,

00:23:23.608 --> 00:23:28.419
because we'll see in the next
monument that I want to show

00:23:28.419 --> 00:23:30.733
you,
that it was that sect that was

00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:34.413
celebrated in a very interesting
underground basilica that I want

00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:35.450
to turn to now.
 

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.759
It doesn't date to the time of
Caligula;

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:40.779
in fact, it's a little bit
later, in the reign of Claudius.

00:23:40.779 --> 00:23:42.578
But I want to show it to you
here,

00:23:42.578 --> 00:23:47.095
because again it was Caligula's
beginning to be more accepting

00:23:47.095 --> 00:23:50.722
of these kinds of things that
led in part to their

00:23:50.722 --> 00:23:54.263
proliferation,
initially underground and then

00:23:54.263 --> 00:23:55.828
above ground as well.
 

00:23:55.828 --> 00:23:57.869
This is the so-called
Underground Basilica,

00:23:57.869 --> 00:23:59.619
because it is located
underground.

00:23:59.619 --> 00:24:03.028
It dates to around A.D. 50.
 

00:24:03.028 --> 00:24:07.259
And you can see from this site
plan its location.

00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.480
You can see it marked
"basilica"

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.752
up there,
and you can see that it's near

00:24:11.752 --> 00:24:13.808
a street we've already talked
about,

00:24:13.808 --> 00:24:17.858
the Via Praenestina in Rome,
which you'll remember is one,

00:24:17.858 --> 00:24:21.077
along with the Via Labicana,
that came and converged on the

00:24:21.077 --> 00:24:23.740
Tomb of the Baker that we looked
at last time.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.563
In fact, if you look at this
site plan, you see the

00:24:26.563 --> 00:24:29.670
trapezoidal plan of the Tomb of
the Baker right here.

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.920
And when we discussed the Tomb
of the Baker,

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.420
I made the point to you that it
was located,

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.640
or it was sited,
in front of a great gate,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.051
the so-called Porta Maggiore,
or the great gate that spanned

00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:43.519
two aqueducts.
 

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:46.982
And I said to you,
I urged you to think away that

00:24:46.982 --> 00:24:49.868
great gate because it was built
later.

00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:51.375
It was built,
in fact, during the reign of

00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:51.779
Claudius.
 

00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:53.930
We're going to look at it
momentarily.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.267
So you see the great gate here,
and you see the Tomb of the

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:01.173
Baker,
and that gives you a sense of

00:25:01.173 --> 00:25:06.096
the location of the basilica,
the Underground Basilica of 50

00:25:06.096 --> 00:25:06.519
A.D.
 

00:25:06.519 --> 00:25:09.826
If you look at that basilica,
you see the plan is exactly

00:25:09.826 --> 00:25:12.190
like the basilica in a civic
context--

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.210
the basilica at Pompeii,
for example--

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.680
with a central nave and two
side aisles,

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.700
divided by that nave,
that central space,

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:25.712
through architectural members,
in this case through piers

00:25:25.712 --> 00:25:28.818
rather than columns;
and then at the end,

00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:32.796
to give some emphasis to one
short side of the space,

00:25:32.796 --> 00:25:35.548
an apse, that you also see
there.

00:25:35.548 --> 00:25:39.640
This underground basilica was
used for religious worship.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.489
So we see once again what I've
referred to as the

00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:45.873
interchangeability of form:
the idea of creating a certain

00:25:45.873 --> 00:25:48.130
building plan for a civic
center,

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.911
the law court or basilica,
and then using it in other

00:25:51.911 --> 00:25:52.420
ways.
 

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:56.074
We already saw the basilican
plan being used in house design

00:25:56.074 --> 00:25:58.490
at Herculaneum as a banqueting
hall,

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:03.403
and here we see it as a
religious, a place for religious

00:26:03.403 --> 00:26:07.961
worship underground:
a basilican form being used for

00:26:07.961 --> 00:26:11.000
religious worship underground.
 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.160
The Underground Basilica is
miraculously preserved.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.048
Why?
 

00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:21.426
Because it's underground and it
didn't--it consequently was kept

00:26:21.426 --> 00:26:23.088
in very good shape over time.
 

00:26:23.088 --> 00:26:26.305
It's very difficult to get
permission to go down and see

00:26:26.305 --> 00:26:29.403
it, but it is a marvel,
as you can see from this image

00:26:29.403 --> 00:26:29.930
here.
 

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:33.618
How did they create this
Underground Basilica?

00:26:33.618 --> 00:26:35.858
How did they make this building
underground?

00:26:35.858 --> 00:26:42.029
Well they cut trenches in the
tufa rock, in the tufa rock;

00:26:42.029 --> 00:26:45.551
remember we've talked about how
ubiquitous tufa rock was in

00:26:45.551 --> 00:26:48.346
Rome, both on the hillsides,
like the Palatine,

00:26:48.346 --> 00:26:49.440
and elsewhere.
 

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:52.009
So they cut trenches in the
tufa rock,

00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:57.148
and then they poured concrete
into those trenches to create

00:26:57.148 --> 00:27:02.818
the walls and also the barrel
vault that you see so well here.

00:27:02.818 --> 00:27:07.525
And once that concrete had
dried, they cut it out in such a

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:12.473
way as to create the piers that
you also see very well in this

00:27:12.473 --> 00:27:13.608
structure.
 

00:27:13.608 --> 00:27:16.009
So we're looking at that
central space;

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:20.038
we're looking at the piers,
the arches above those piers,

00:27:20.038 --> 00:27:23.588
and then that's supporting a
barrel vaulting ceiling,

00:27:23.588 --> 00:27:27.848
as well as a semi-vault in the
apse of this structure.

00:27:27.848 --> 00:27:32.082
Another view gives you a sense
of the relationship of the

00:27:32.082 --> 00:27:34.348
central space to the aisles.
 

00:27:34.348 --> 00:27:37.406
It's a fairly small structure
but nonetheless it is quite

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.090
light and airy,
as I think you can see here,

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.372
as we look from the central
nave toward one of the side

00:27:43.372 --> 00:27:43.980
aisles.
 

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.596
You can see the piers and the
arches above those piers,

00:27:46.596 --> 00:27:49.700
and you can also see the way in
which the walls are decorated.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.434
They're made out of concrete
but they're stuccoed over and

00:27:53.434 --> 00:27:57.432
divided into a series of panels
that are decorated with pretty

00:27:57.432 --> 00:27:59.990
strong resemblance to Third
Style,

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:03.636
and that resemblance becomes
even clearer as we look up to

00:28:03.636 --> 00:28:04.788
the vault above.
 

00:28:04.788 --> 00:28:11.310
This is how we surmise that
this building was put up to the

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.159
Neo-Pythagorean cult,
because of the figures that we

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:16.730
see floating in the central
panels here.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:19.641
Those who have a good
understanding of the

00:28:19.641 --> 00:28:23.262
Neo-Pythagorean cult have
suggested that these track

00:28:23.262 --> 00:28:27.170
extremely well the beliefs of
this particular cult.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.176
But interesting for us is again
the close resemblance of this to

00:28:30.176 --> 00:28:31.799
Third Style Roman wall painting.
 

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:33.118
It's done in stucco.
 

00:28:33.118 --> 00:28:35.892
The stucco is painted,
but you can see it's divided

00:28:35.892 --> 00:28:39.328
into a series of panels with
floating mythological figures,

00:28:39.328 --> 00:28:42.049
or floating religious figures
in this case,

00:28:42.049 --> 00:28:43.818
inside the panels.
 

00:28:43.818 --> 00:28:48.140
And look then very carefully at
some of the floral decorations,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.198
which you will see also
resemble very closely the flimsy

00:28:52.198 --> 00:28:56.478
candelabra and so on that are
characteristic of Third Style

00:28:56.478 --> 00:28:57.880
Roman painting.
 

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.900
This shouldn't surprise you.
 

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.078
The date of 50 A.D.
 

00:29:00.078 --> 00:29:01.970
is still well within the Third
Style.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.568
We've talked about the very
long life of the Third Style,

00:29:04.568 --> 00:29:07.470
that it was used already in the
late first century B.C.,

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.450
but that it didn't really go
out until about 62 A.D.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.500
So 50 was still in that period
of the Third Style;

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.535
it doesn't surprise us to see
decoration like this,

00:29:19.535 --> 00:29:23.410
in this very interesting
Underground Basilica.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:30.537
Caligula was murdered in 41,
and his wife and daughter--he

00:29:30.537 --> 00:29:37.538
had one daughter--were also
murdered at the same time.

00:29:37.538 --> 00:29:41.357
He had no family member to
succeed him, and his uncle

00:29:41.357 --> 00:29:45.029
Claudius was chosen as the next
emperor of Rome.

00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:48.137
Many of you may know the
interesting story,

00:29:48.137 --> 00:29:52.060
quite captivating story,
of how Claudius was chosen as

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:52.950
emperor.
 

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.527
He was someone who was not
highly respected by his

00:29:55.527 --> 00:29:58.210
family--and I'll say more about
that in a moment;

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.368
no one ever thought he was
going to amount to anything.

00:30:00.368 --> 00:30:04.070
And when, after Caligula's
death, Claudius was such,

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.410
kind of timid,
that he hid behind a curtain.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.808
But as the Praetorian Guard
wandered through the palace,

00:30:10.808 --> 00:30:13.972
trying to figure out who in the
world they were going to appoint

00:30:13.972 --> 00:30:17.071
as Caligula's successor,
they saw a pair of feet

00:30:17.071 --> 00:30:18.740
underneath a curtain.
 

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:21.054
They pulled open that curtain
and they saw Claudius,

00:30:21.054 --> 00:30:23.186
and they thought,
"Well he's going to be no

00:30:23.186 --> 00:30:24.049
trouble at all.
 

00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:25.298
No one thinks much of him.
 

00:30:25.298 --> 00:30:28.307
We're going to be able to get
everything we want if we appoint

00:30:28.307 --> 00:30:29.690
Claudius as emperor."
 

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.296
And so they did,
they bowed down,

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.900
and they said,
"You are now--",

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.088
or they put him up on their
shoulders,

00:30:34.088 --> 00:30:36.308
"You are now emperor of
Rome."

00:30:36.308 --> 00:30:39.669
Well Claudius surprised them
because he was a very smart

00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:41.930
individual indeed,
as we shall see.

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.864
This is a cameo,
a famous cameo that represents

00:30:44.864 --> 00:30:46.828
Claudius,
just for you to get some sense

00:30:46.828 --> 00:30:49.086
of what he looked like,
over here on the left,

00:30:49.086 --> 00:30:51.497
with his wife,
and then possibly--these two

00:30:51.497 --> 00:30:53.529
figures over here are
controversial--

00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:57.866
possibly with Tiberius or some
other member of the imperial

00:30:57.866 --> 00:30:58.538
family.
 

00:30:58.538 --> 00:31:02.028
This is blown up into colossal
size.

00:31:02.028 --> 00:31:04.772
It's a fairly small but very
beautiful cameo,

00:31:04.772 --> 00:31:08.451
and these cameos were used as
presentation pieces in ancient

00:31:08.451 --> 00:31:09.450
Roman times.
 

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.142
Claudius was emperor of Rome
between A.D.

00:31:13.142 --> 00:31:14.250
41 and 54.
 

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:18.788
I mentioned that his family did
not have much respect for him.

00:31:18.788 --> 00:31:23.885
They thought he was weak and
sickly, and they thought he was

00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:25.009
dim-witted.
 

00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.123
And the only reason they
thought he was dim-witted,

00:31:27.123 --> 00:31:29.446
because the poor fellow
stammered, and they thought that

00:31:29.446 --> 00:31:31.180
that reflected an undisciplined
mind.

00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.740
Not at all, he was very,
very intelligent indeed,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.519
and he surprised them.
 

00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.747
He surprised not only the
Praetorian Guard but also his

00:31:39.747 --> 00:31:41.720
family, when he became emperor.
 

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.380
He turned out to be a unique
individual with a predilection,

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:49.490
as we shall see,
for an entirely new kind of,

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.660
and very distinctive form of
architecture,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:57.057
and one that I believe--and
I'll try to make the case to you

00:31:57.057 --> 00:32:00.509
today--
reflected his very distinctive

00:32:00.509 --> 00:32:01.528
intellect.
 

00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:05.208
We need to know therefore
something about him and how he

00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:09.422
came--how he had trained himself
intellectually before he became

00:32:09.422 --> 00:32:10.759
emperor of Rome.
 

00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:13.618
He was fifty-years-old when he
became emperor.

00:32:13.618 --> 00:32:16.856
He had been,
in the years prior to that,

00:32:16.856 --> 00:32:20.094
a scholar, an historian,
an antiquarian,

00:32:20.094 --> 00:32:21.338
a linguist.
 

00:32:21.338 --> 00:32:24.608
He wrote a history of Rome by
himself--it was not

00:32:24.608 --> 00:32:27.471
ghostwritten--and he wrote
several volumes,

00:32:27.471 --> 00:32:30.058
also on his own,
on the Etruscans;

00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:32.868
he was particularly interested
in the Etruscans.

00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:36.605
We know he added a few letters
to the Latin alphabet to give it

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:39.319
more range,
and he was the last Roman,

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:43.157
as far as we know,
to be able to read and also

00:32:43.157 --> 00:32:44.578
write Etruscan.
 

00:32:44.578 --> 00:32:47.150
This gives you a very good
sense of the man.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:51.523
With regard to architecture,
he rejected categorically the

00:32:51.523 --> 00:32:56.130
interests of Tiberius and
Caligula in villa architecture,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.960
and he returned to the
construction of public

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.701
architecture--
he looked to Augustus as a

00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:08.109
model for this--
and especially to public works.

00:33:08.109 --> 00:33:09.430
Let me show you one example.
 

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:16.000
You see on the screen a site
plan of the port of Rome.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.410
I've already mentioned the fact
that the port of Rome was

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.271
located at Ostia,
Ostia the city at the mouth of

00:33:22.271 --> 00:33:23.490
the Tiber River.
 

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.544
We saw the plan of Ostia,
a colony already founded in the

00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:30.390
mid-fourth century B.C.,
in around 350,

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:33.759
and it grew over time and it
had its efflorescence,

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:36.796
as we'll see in a later
lecture, in the second century

00:33:36.796 --> 00:33:37.140
A.D.
 

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.220
Here the plan of Ostia over
here.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.046
The Tiber River,
and then at the mouth of the

00:33:44.046 --> 00:33:46.950
Tiber River,
at a place that we call Portus,

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.578
a location that we call Portus
or Porto--

00:33:49.578 --> 00:33:54.170
it's on the Monument List for
you--the actual harbor itself.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:57.660
What we're looking at above is
a coin of the emperor Nero.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:01.832
You see Nero on the obverse and
on the reverse a representation

00:34:01.832 --> 00:34:05.130
of what we think is the port
built by Claudius.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:09.268
We have a description of the
port of Claudius by Suetonius in

00:34:09.268 --> 00:34:10.579
his Lives.
 

00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:16.632
Suetonius tells us that the
port had curving breakwaters,

00:34:16.632 --> 00:34:19.010
curving breakwaters.
 

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:23.324
And if we look at this coin of
Nero that was struck by the

00:34:23.324 --> 00:34:28.324
emperor between 64 and 68 A.D.,
we see on the back what is

00:34:28.324 --> 00:34:34.010
clearly a port,
with curving breakwaters.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.094
So we believe that this must be
a depiction of the port built by

00:34:38.094 --> 00:34:40.882
Claudius sometime during his
reign, that is,

00:34:40.882 --> 00:34:42.309
between 41 and 54.
 

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:47.688
What does that coin tell us
about what that port must have

00:34:47.688 --> 00:34:49.010
looked like?
 

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.547
We can see that there is a
large statue in the upper

00:34:50.547 --> 00:34:50.820
center.
 

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:54.871
There is a river god reclining
below, probably the Tiber

00:34:54.871 --> 00:34:59.143
himself, to locate this port,
and also a series of boats in

00:34:59.143 --> 00:35:00.250
the center.
 

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.300
But most important again are
the curving breakwaters,

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.530
which you can see are made up
of a series of columns;

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.972
they look like colonnades,
one on either side,

00:35:09.972 --> 00:35:11.579
curving colonnades.
 

00:35:11.579 --> 00:35:16.615
This plan down here shows us
the likely plan of the Claudian

00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:18.742
harbor,
roughly circular,

00:35:18.742 --> 00:35:21.739
again with breakwaters on
either side,

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:23.980
with columns on either side.
 

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.342
This area was added to by the
emperor Trajan,

00:35:27.342 --> 00:35:29.940
in the early second century
A.D.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:36.184
He added a five-sided port as
well, and you can see that here,

00:35:36.184 --> 00:35:38.539
in this plan as well.
 

00:35:38.539 --> 00:35:39.829
But think that away for now.
 

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:43.201
All that would've been there
was Claudius' port with the

00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:44.550
curving breakwaters.
 

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.889
This is a painting of both of
those ports, that's on the wall

00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:50.119
in the Vatican.
 

00:35:50.119 --> 00:35:54.702
I've walked by it many times
and only recently really noticed

00:35:54.702 --> 00:35:58.280
it and took a picture of it,
and I think it'll be helpful to

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.699
you today because it gives you a
sense of what this port looked

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:01.518
like in antiquity.
 

00:36:01.518 --> 00:36:04.518
We see the later port of Trajan
over here.

00:36:04.518 --> 00:36:07.704
But again think that away for
now and concentrate on the

00:36:07.704 --> 00:36:10.018
curving breakwaters of Claudius'
port.

00:36:10.018 --> 00:36:14.188
You see here this colossal
statue, possibly of Neptune,

00:36:14.188 --> 00:36:18.432
over here, a lighthouse,
over here, and the boats in the

00:36:18.432 --> 00:36:19.900
center of this.
 

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.916
But most important for us again
are those curving breakwaters

00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:25.380
and the fact that they were made
up of columns.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.322
The columns are all that
survive today,

00:36:28.322 --> 00:36:31.190
and what a set of columns they
are.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:35.369
I show a detail of some of them
to you here.

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:37.847
And you should be struck by
these columns,

00:36:37.847 --> 00:36:41.291
because these are columns
unlike any other columns that we

00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:44.010
have seen in the course of this
semester.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:45.768
If you look at these columns
very carefully,

00:36:45.768 --> 00:36:49.840
you will see that the capitals
on the top,

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.143
which are very severe--they're
not exactly the Doric order but

00:36:53.143 --> 00:36:56.030
they resemble the Doric order--
very severe,

00:36:56.030 --> 00:37:00.384
and they are finished;
you can identify them as

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:01.320
capitals.
 

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.760
And the bases,
I'll show you a view of the

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.556
bases in a moment,
the bases, as we'll also see,

00:37:06.556 --> 00:37:09.949
are also finished with very
nice moldings down below.

00:37:09.949 --> 00:37:13.150
But in between the bases and
the capitals,

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:16.690
we see something again that
we've never seen before,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:19.780
and that is a series of drums,
of column drums,

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.110
piled one on top of another.
 

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:25.606
But those drums are not
finished, or they're left in a

00:37:25.606 --> 00:37:27.849
rough state -- one or the other.
 

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:31.175
They have either been
deliberately left in a rough or

00:37:31.175 --> 00:37:33.989
rusticated state,
or they were unfinished.

00:37:33.989 --> 00:37:35.679
Why might they have been
unfinished?

00:37:35.679 --> 00:37:41.599
They might have been unfinished
because the project was late,

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.550
they were rushing it,
they wanted to get it done,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.250
they needed to use the harbor,
and so they said,

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:49.628
"Look, to save time just
put those columns up the way

00:37:49.628 --> 00:37:52.652
they are and don't bother
finishing the drums of the

00:37:52.652 --> 00:37:53.659
column."
 

00:37:53.659 --> 00:37:57.353
Or one could argue that it
might have had to do with

00:37:57.353 --> 00:37:59.411
expense,
that it was getting too

00:37:59.411 --> 00:38:02.920
expensive, and that they decided
not to finish the drums for that

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.469
reason.
 

00:38:03.469 --> 00:38:06.592
Or it might have been
deliberate, or it might have

00:38:06.592 --> 00:38:09.460
been deliberate:
the idea to leave those drums

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.010
rough, to make them look
rusticated.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:14.722
I'm going to make a case today
that it's the last,

00:38:14.722 --> 00:38:18.320
that this was a deliberate move
on Claudius and his architects.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.679
And one of the main reasons I
can make that--

00:38:20.679 --> 00:38:23.130
if this is all we had,
if we had only this port of

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.005
Claudius,
only these columns in this

00:38:25.005 --> 00:38:27.559
style, it would be very
difficult to make the case.

00:38:27.559 --> 00:38:30.367
But as we're going to see,
when we move from this to that

00:38:30.367 --> 00:38:32.036
great gate,
or the Porta Maggiore,

00:38:32.036 --> 00:38:33.530
which was put up under
Claudius,

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.057
and then not today but next
time, to a building that was put

00:38:37.057 --> 00:38:39.510
up in Claudius' honor after his
death,

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:44.106
we will see that all three of
those have these rusticated

00:38:44.106 --> 00:38:47.994
columns or piers in common,
which suggests to us--it

00:38:47.994 --> 00:38:51.443
suggests to me for sure--
that these are--that leaving

00:38:51.443 --> 00:38:55.385
them in this rusticated state
was deliberate on the part of

00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:57.630
the patron and his architects.
 

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:03.083
And I'm also going to suggest
that it had to do with Claudius'

00:39:03.083 --> 00:39:06.864
peculiar personality,
and especially his interest in

00:39:06.864 --> 00:39:08.331
antiquarianism,
in the past,

00:39:08.331 --> 00:39:11.099
in the history of Rome,
and the history of the

00:39:11.099 --> 00:39:12.739
Etruscans, and so on.
 

00:39:12.739 --> 00:39:18.090
Here's another detail of one of
the columns over here,

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.463
where you can see the rough
drum, and then down below the

00:39:20.463 --> 00:39:22.554
base on which that sits,
a molded base,

00:39:22.554 --> 00:39:24.110
very carefully molded.
 

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:25.882
The architects,
the designers,

00:39:25.882 --> 00:39:29.614
the artisans could finish these
columns perfectly well if they

00:39:29.614 --> 00:39:30.409
chose to.
 

00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:32.739
They did it on the base,
they did it in the capitals,

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:33.679
but not in between.
 

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:36.974
Here's another one where you
can see a series of columns

00:39:36.974 --> 00:39:40.030
engaged into a wall,
and again you can see the rough

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:41.469
or rusticated drums.
 

00:39:41.469 --> 00:39:46.349
Then down below the molded and
finished bases.

00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:50.039
So this difference between what
we call finished masonry or

00:39:50.039 --> 00:39:53.722
dressed--
d-r-e-s-s-e-d--dressed masonry,

00:39:53.722 --> 00:39:58.532
or rusticated masonry:
masonry that is deliberately

00:39:58.532 --> 00:39:59.880
left rough.
 

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.690
Again, in order to underscore
this point,

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:08.472
I want to turn now to the great
gate or the Porta Maggiore in

00:40:08.472 --> 00:40:13.043
Rome,
also built by Claudius between

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:15.010
41 and 54 A.D.
 

00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.293
You already know its location,
near the Tomb of Eurysaces,

00:40:18.293 --> 00:40:21.809
near the Underground Basilica
that we also discussed today.

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:26.728
And I had mentioned to you
already that the purpose of this

00:40:26.728 --> 00:40:31.393
gate was to serve as a crossing
point for two aqueducts:

00:40:31.393 --> 00:40:35.039
aqueducts that had been begun
earlier,

00:40:35.039 --> 00:40:37.670
were worked on by Caligula,
and then completed by Claudius.

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.400
And there were two of them that
crossed at this very point,

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:45.018
and they needed something to
mask that crossing,

00:40:45.018 --> 00:40:48.409
and so they built this great
gate, the Porta Maggiore.

00:40:48.409 --> 00:40:51.487
If you look at this general
view of the Porta Maggiore,

00:40:51.487 --> 00:40:54.510
you will see much of what I
have already described.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:55.860
It has two open archways.
 

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.699
The uppermost part,
which is the attic,

00:40:58.699 --> 00:41:01.050
which has an inscription--it's
a three-tiered attic,

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:03.469
as you can see,
and if you look carefully you

00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:05.889
will see it has an extensive
inscription,

00:41:05.889 --> 00:41:08.889
making reference to Claudius
and to the aqueducts and so on.

00:41:08.889 --> 00:41:13.005
Down below we see a series of
smaller arcuations,

00:41:13.005 --> 00:41:17.891
surrounded by columns on either
side, supporting pediments

00:41:17.891 --> 00:41:18.750
above.
 

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:22.420
If you look closely you can see
that the pediments are finished,

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.750
the pediments are finished,
the lintels are finished,

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.199
the capitals are finished,
but the blocks of the column

00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:32.777
and the blocks of the rest of
the structure are left in a

00:41:32.777 --> 00:41:34.119
rusticated state.
 

00:41:34.119 --> 00:41:37.047
They are not finished,
and we see that very stark

00:41:37.047 --> 00:41:39.976
difference between the
rusticated masonry and the

00:41:39.976 --> 00:41:42.539
finished masonry:
the smooth masonry,

00:41:42.539 --> 00:41:47.010
the dressed masonry and the
rough masonry in this structure.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:50.442
This gate, by the way,
is made out of

00:41:50.442 --> 00:41:55.018
travertine--travertine cut stone
construction.

00:41:55.018 --> 00:41:58.775
Here's another view that I
think shows you better the way

00:41:58.775 --> 00:42:03.000
in which this gate masks the
crossing of those two aqueducts.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.824
You can see two channels there,
and one would have had pipes

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:10.715
running through it one way and
the other would have had pipes

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:13.179
running through it the other
way,

00:42:13.179 --> 00:42:17.010
and that's how they crossed in
antiquity.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.795
And I'll show you a model that
may make that even clearer in a

00:42:18.795 --> 00:42:19.059
moment.
 

00:42:19.059 --> 00:42:22.838
You can also see the location
of the Tomb of the baker

00:42:22.838 --> 00:42:26.760
Eurysaces right next to the
so-called Porta Maggiore.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:29.081
Here's the model that I showed
you when we looked at the Tomb

00:42:29.081 --> 00:42:31.007
of Eurysaces,
the way in which the

00:42:31.007 --> 00:42:34.804
Praenestina and the Labicana
come into Rome and converge at

00:42:34.804 --> 00:42:37.030
the façade of that tomb.
 

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:40.449
Here you see the great gate or
Porta Maggiore behind it.

00:42:40.449 --> 00:42:43.824
And this is the best
illustration I can give of the

00:42:43.824 --> 00:42:48.556
way in which those two,
the pipes of the two aqueducts,

00:42:48.556 --> 00:42:52.110
cross behind the attic of the
gate,

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.400
which is one of the reasons it
had to be as tall as it did,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.489
and one of the reasons it had
to have tiers was in order--

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:59.550
because it was separated behind.
 

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:03.414
You can see that very well
here, as well as the rusticated,

00:43:03.414 --> 00:43:06.744
the contrast between the
rusticated masonry and the

00:43:06.744 --> 00:43:09.409
finished masonry of this great
gate.

00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:18.010
This combination of the two is
a very mannered thing to do,

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.112
and it's interesting that later
Renaissance architects in

00:43:20.112 --> 00:43:22.266
Italy--
and for those of you who are

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:26.257
aficionados of the Renaissance,
you may know the work of an

00:43:26.257 --> 00:43:30.362
architect by the name of Giulio
Romano who created the famous

00:43:30.362 --> 00:43:32.280
Palazzo del Te in Mantua.
 

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.969
And I show you a detail of the
Palazzo del Te,

00:43:34.969 --> 00:43:36.809
just to make the point,
the more general point--

00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:38.960
you don't have to worry about
Giulio--

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.039
but just to make the general
point that these Renaissance

00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:44.217
architects,
like Giulio Romano,

00:43:44.217 --> 00:43:48.664
looked back to buildings like
the Porta Maggiore in Rome when

00:43:48.664 --> 00:43:52.815
they also conceived of buildings
in which they contrasted

00:43:52.815 --> 00:43:56.150
rusticated masonry with smooth
masonry,

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:57.920
as you can also see so well.
 

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:01.440
And here are two last details
of the Porta Maggiore,

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:04.710
and I think these show you,
almost more than anything else

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:07.353
I have thus far,
this incredible contrast

00:44:07.353 --> 00:44:10.590
between the finished and the
unfinished masonry,

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.969
between the smooth and the
rough.

00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:16.039
And here you see,
you can see a detail of the

00:44:16.039 --> 00:44:18.690
pediment, of the smoothness of
that;

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:21.445
of the lintel down below;
of the capital,

00:44:21.445 --> 00:44:24.994
which is completely finished;
and then even of the uppermost

00:44:24.994 --> 00:44:25.630
part of the column.
 

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.610
And this is a particularly
interesting detail,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:29.639
I think, because it gives me
the sense,

00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:32.818
as I look at it,
that what the patron and

00:44:32.818 --> 00:44:37.664
architects are trying to do is
give us a sense that the column

00:44:37.664 --> 00:44:41.400
actually lives inside the
rusticated drums.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:45.048
I get the sense as I look at
this that this finished column

00:44:45.048 --> 00:44:49.076
is just--is very anxious to bust
out of the rusticated masonry in

00:44:49.076 --> 00:44:53.661
which it is confined;
it's very anxious to emerge

00:44:53.661 --> 00:44:57.010
from that rusticated masonry.
 

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.021
And I can't help but think of
the Renaissance again,

00:45:00.021 --> 00:45:01.969
and especially of Michelangelo.
 

00:45:01.969 --> 00:45:05.324
For any of who've seen his
slaves in the Accademia in

00:45:05.324 --> 00:45:07.657
Florence,
the slaves that seem to--he

00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:10.079
took these big blocks of Carrara
marble,

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:13.967
and he represents the slaves as
if they are still immersed in

00:45:13.967 --> 00:45:17.684
that marble,
but trying to break free from

00:45:17.684 --> 00:45:20.873
that marble,
as if these images of human

00:45:20.873 --> 00:45:24.599
beings were somehow located
inside that marble and just

00:45:24.599 --> 00:45:28.186
waiting for the genius
Michelangelo to free them from

00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:29.360
that marble.
 

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.219
It's the same sense that I get
here when I look at this,

00:45:32.219 --> 00:45:35.320
and it makes me think again
that a very intelligent,

00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:41.268
a very refined mind is behind
sorting out this kind of thing,

00:45:41.268 --> 00:45:44.130
and conceiving of something of
this nature.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:47.606
And given the education and the
bent of Claudius,

00:45:47.606 --> 00:45:51.518
he is just the kind of man who
might have done that.

00:45:51.518 --> 00:45:54.460
And I think we need to see the
architecture of Claudius,

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.320
this rusticated architecture of
Claudius,

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:00.532
which is contrasted to the
smooth and finished

00:46:00.532 --> 00:46:03.251
architecture,
at the same time,

00:46:03.251 --> 00:46:07.059
as something that really is
reflective of the peculiar

00:46:07.059 --> 00:46:09.000
personality of this man.
 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.311
I think it's also important to
say though that this kind of

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:13.795
architecture,
at this time,

00:46:13.795 --> 00:46:15.280
is very old-fashioned.
 

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.860
The whole idea of using cut
stone travertine construction,

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.309
after what we've seen is going
on in concrete construction,

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:24.559
is a very old-fashioned thing
to do,

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:27.219
and again shows us a man who is
looking to the past,

00:46:27.219 --> 00:46:28.840
who's looking to the history of
Rome,

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.860
to the history of the
Etruscans, perhaps rather than

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.199
to the present.
 

00:46:34.199 --> 00:46:38.735
But, on the positive side,
one could also say that what he

00:46:38.735 --> 00:46:41.757
is doing here,
he is using stone construction,

00:46:41.757 --> 00:46:44.179
but he is using it in a very
different way,

00:46:44.179 --> 00:46:46.659
and indeed an almost
anti-classical way,

00:46:46.659 --> 00:46:48.760
to the way in which Augustus
used it.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:50.489
Think of Augustus' Ara Pacis.
 

00:46:50.489 --> 00:46:54.461
Think of Augustus' Temple of
Mars Ultor in the Forum of

00:46:54.461 --> 00:46:55.860
Augustus in Rome.
 

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.960
Both of those marble buildings,
in that case Luna or Carrara

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.018
marble, based on ancient Greek
prototypes.

00:47:03.018 --> 00:47:04.856
This is also stone
architecture,

00:47:04.856 --> 00:47:07.047
and in that sense again
old-fashioned,

00:47:07.047 --> 00:47:09.179
but it's travertine,
not marble.

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:13.722
But it is anti-classical in its
use of this rusticated,

00:47:13.722 --> 00:47:16.079
as well as smooth masonry.
 

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:21.235
So I do want you to ponder this
architecture of Claudius and

00:47:21.235 --> 00:47:26.043
think for yourselves about
whether you think again it is

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.909
due,
the form that it takes is due

00:47:28.909 --> 00:47:33.068
to the very interesting and
unusual personality of this one

00:47:33.068 --> 00:47:33.570
man.
 

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:37.695
From Claudius,
I want to turn to the notorious

00:47:37.695 --> 00:47:41.820
Nero, and his amazing
architectural legacy.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:47.117
And you see a portrait of Nero
here, on the right-hand side of

00:47:47.117 --> 00:47:51.719
the screen, and a coin with his
mother on the left.

00:47:51.719 --> 00:47:54.960
The mother of Nero was
Agrippina the Younger.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:58.619
Agrippina the Younger was the
last wife of Claudius,

00:47:58.619 --> 00:48:02.615
and it was rumored that
Agrippina the Younger murdered

00:48:02.615 --> 00:48:06.010
Claudius with a bowl of poisoned
mushrooms.

00:48:06.010 --> 00:48:08.710
We don't know if that's true or
not, it may be just rumor

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:09.289
mongering.
 

00:48:09.289 --> 00:48:12.293
But it's perfectly conceivable
because she certainly had a

00:48:12.293 --> 00:48:14.239
motive,
and that is she thought she

00:48:14.239 --> 00:48:16.500
would have more power if her
teenage son--

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:19.449
because he was only about
17-years-old at the time--

00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:22.789
was on the throne of Rome,
instead of her older husband.

00:48:22.789 --> 00:48:25.614
And this coin that you see on
the left-hand side of the

00:48:25.614 --> 00:48:28.860
screen, of the young Nero and
Agrippina I think says it all;

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.469
I mean, mother and son almost
nose to nose.

00:48:31.469 --> 00:48:38.039
This gives real meaning to
being 'in your face';

00:48:38.039 --> 00:48:40.476
as you can see here,
Agrippina is certainly in the

00:48:40.476 --> 00:48:41.869
face of Nero on this coin.
 

00:48:41.869 --> 00:48:46.425
And she was with regard to his
life, dominating him in the very

00:48:46.425 --> 00:48:48.409
early years of his reign.
 

00:48:48.409 --> 00:48:51.460
Nero was born in A.D. 37.
 

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:54.340
He was emperor between 54 and
68.

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:57.746
At his death,
his murder--he was forced to

00:48:57.746 --> 00:49:02.427
commit suicide actually in 68--
he suffered a damnatio

00:49:02.427 --> 00:49:06.807
memoriae,
which was a condemnation by the

00:49:06.807 --> 00:49:10.010
Senate of him,
a damnation of his memory;

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:12.829
and an attempt to destroy his
portraits,

00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:14.809
and also his architectural
monuments,

00:49:14.809 --> 00:49:18.672
followed that damnatio
memoriae. Nero was the last

00:49:18.672 --> 00:49:20.949
of the Julio-Claudian emperors.
 

00:49:20.949 --> 00:49:24.760
He was the adoptive son of
Claudius, and as I've already

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.878
mentioned the real son of
Claudius' last wife,

00:49:27.878 --> 00:49:29.610
Agrippina the Elder .
 

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.286
I mentioned already that
Agrippina--or I gave you the

00:49:33.286 --> 00:49:37.032
sense--that Agrippina was a
quite aggressive woman who

00:49:37.032 --> 00:49:39.719
aggravated Claudius and Nero
both.

00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:42.110
We talked about the poisoned
mushroom stories,

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:46.010
and the fact that when her son
became emperor,

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.219
she received,
at least for a while,

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:52.039
enhanced power in Rome.
 

00:49:52.039 --> 00:49:54.626
But Nero eventually paid his
mother back by having her

00:49:54.626 --> 00:49:55.407
murdered in A.D.
 

00:49:55.407 --> 00:49:55.699
59.
 

00:49:55.699 --> 00:49:59.945
He also got rid of his wife
Octavia, a beautiful young girl

00:49:59.945 --> 00:50:02.070
whom he had murdered in 62.
 

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.849
So by the age of 25,
Nero had gotten rid of the

00:50:05.849 --> 00:50:07.996
women,
the two women,

00:50:07.996 --> 00:50:12.411
who had dominated his youth,
and his much-touted madness--he

00:50:12.411 --> 00:50:15.349
was not unlike Caligula in some
of the wild things that he did--

00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:18.219
his much-touted madness began
to appear.

00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:22.840
That said, despite his madness,
he was absolutely adored by the

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:23.659
populace.
 

00:50:23.659 --> 00:50:27.108
It was a great show to watch
Nero, and people liked seeing

00:50:27.108 --> 00:50:28.559
what he would do next.
 

00:50:28.559 --> 00:50:30.239
He was adored by the populace.
 

00:50:30.239 --> 00:50:34.057
He was however hated by the
aristocracy and in 68,

00:50:34.057 --> 00:50:38.188
he was hunted down by his
enemies and he was forced to

00:50:38.188 --> 00:50:39.670
commit suicide.
 

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:46.750
I would call Nero a patron of
architecture extraordinaire.

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:49.786
His contribution to the
development of Roman

00:50:49.786 --> 00:50:52.539
architecture is indeed
extraordinary.

00:50:52.539 --> 00:50:56.442
He had a passion for the arts,
which undoubtedly led to his

00:50:56.442 --> 00:50:57.989
devotion to building.
 

00:50:57.989 --> 00:51:00.010
He wrote and he sang poems.
 

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:01.250
Nero was a musician.
 

00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.360
He collected Greek works of art.
 

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.300
He traveled to Greece to
participate in the Olympics.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:09.885
Whenever he did that,
they were always fixed in his

00:51:09.885 --> 00:51:10.460
favor.
 

00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:13.230
When he traveled around Greece
and Asia Minor,

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:15.817
he stole--if he saw a work of
art he liked,

00:51:15.817 --> 00:51:18.402
he stole it,
and he brought it back to Rome

00:51:18.402 --> 00:51:19.449
to display.
 

00:51:19.449 --> 00:51:23.701
He interwove his life with his
art, in the same manner as

00:51:23.701 --> 00:51:24.840
Claudius did.
 

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:29.110
He took advantage of that very
famous fire in Rome,

00:51:29.110 --> 00:51:33.637
which took place in 64 A.D.,
to--legend has it that he

00:51:33.637 --> 00:51:36.199
fiddled while Rome burned.
 

00:51:36.199 --> 00:51:39.818
He wasn't fiddling actually but
he was participating in some

00:51:39.818 --> 00:51:42.860
sort of musical performance;
we know that.

00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.556
And after the fire raged
through the city and caused

00:51:46.556 --> 00:51:49.599
incredible havoc and great
destruction,

00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:54.210
what Nero did was instead of
rebuilding the land for the

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:59.327
people of Rome,
he just expropriated 300 to 350

00:51:59.327 --> 00:52:04.679
acres of prime real estate in
downtown Rome,

00:52:04.679 --> 00:52:08.650
and he used it to build his own
villa,

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.030
his own palace,
in the center of Rome,

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.840
the famous Domus Aurea or
Golden House,

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:15.730
because it had a gilded
façade.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:19.471
Nero's architecture was
intimately bound up with the

00:52:19.471 --> 00:52:23.798
vicissitudes of his life and his
distinctive, if not warped,

00:52:23.798 --> 00:52:26.219
personality,
as we shall see.

00:52:26.219 --> 00:52:31.349
Nero built two palaces in Rome,
and I'd like to begin with the

00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:36.059
one--I'd like to deal with those
in consecutive order.

00:52:36.059 --> 00:52:38.472
The first of these,
as you can see from the

00:52:38.472 --> 00:52:41.356
Monument List,
is the so-called Domus

00:52:41.356 --> 00:52:44.831
Transitoria--
the less well-known one and

00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:48.393
less well-preserved one--
the Domus Transitoria in Rome

00:52:48.393 --> 00:52:50.400
that was built sometime before
the fire,

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:51.306
before A.D.
 

00:52:51.306 --> 00:52:55.762
64, because it was very
significantly destroyed in that

00:52:55.762 --> 00:52:56.751
fire of A.D.
 

00:52:56.751 --> 00:52:57.329
64.
 

00:52:57.329 --> 00:53:02.318
I'm showing you a Google Earth
image of the part of Rome in

00:53:02.318 --> 00:53:05.329
which this building found
itself.

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:07.809
We are looking down--we've seen
this one before--

00:53:07.809 --> 00:53:09.699
we are looking down at the
Roman Forum,

00:53:09.699 --> 00:53:12.719
the Colosseum in the uppermost
part there,

00:53:12.719 --> 00:53:15.489
the Palatine Hill over here.
 

00:53:15.489 --> 00:53:19.945
And if we follow the Roman
Forum toward the Colosseum and

00:53:19.945 --> 00:53:23.130
toward the later Arch of
Constantine,

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:27.190
we will see that there is a
spur hill over,

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:31.255
and that spur hill is located
between the Palatine Hill and

00:53:31.255 --> 00:53:34.844
one of Rome's other hills,
the Esquiline--E-s-q

00:53:34.844 --> 00:53:37.489
-u-i-l-i-n-e--the Esquiline
Hill.

00:53:37.489 --> 00:53:43.485
Nero's dream was to link the
buildings that were going up on

00:53:43.485 --> 00:53:45.010
the Palatine.
 

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:47.391
We've already talked about the
Imperial Palace,

00:53:47.391 --> 00:53:49.619
begun by Tiberius,
continued by Caligula.

00:53:49.619 --> 00:53:50.989
Claudius had no interest in
that.

00:53:50.989 --> 00:53:55.045
But then Nero returns to it,
and he's continuing to build

00:53:55.045 --> 00:53:57.219
this palace on the Palatine.
 

00:53:57.219 --> 00:54:01.088
But his dream is to link that
with property that he also owns

00:54:01.088 --> 00:54:04.739
on the Esquiline Hill,
and to make one truly grandiose

00:54:04.739 --> 00:54:07.110
palace that links those two
hills,

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.139
across a spur hill called the
Velia,

00:54:10.139 --> 00:54:13.601
V-e-l-i-a, which is in this
uppermost part of the Roman

00:54:13.601 --> 00:54:16.599
Forum,
closest to the Colosseum.

00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:20.554
That was his dream,
and he began to try to realize

00:54:20.554 --> 00:54:22.250
it prior to 64 A.D.
 

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.670
The building is called the
Domus Transitoria because it

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:29.219
served as a point of transit
between those two hills,

00:54:29.219 --> 00:54:32.320
between the Palatine and the
Esquiline Hills.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.929
Again, because it was so
seriously destroyed in fire,

00:54:35.929 --> 00:54:40.505
and also because it was
deliberately destroyed by later

00:54:40.505 --> 00:54:44.320
emperors who were following the
damnation,

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.199
the damnatio memoriae,
the damnation of Nero's memory,

00:54:48.199 --> 00:54:51.039
and felt that it was their
right, in a sense,

00:54:51.039 --> 00:54:52.360
to destroy his buildings.
 

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.000
So those two things together,
deliberate destruction plus the

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:59.639
fire, essentially destroyed most
of the Domus Transitoria.

00:54:59.639 --> 00:55:02.159
But a couple of sections are
preserved underground,

00:55:02.159 --> 00:55:05.971
and they're very important for
us to look at because they give

00:55:05.971 --> 00:55:09.469
us insight into the later Golden
House or Domus Aurea.

00:55:09.469 --> 00:55:12.193
I want to show you the two
sections that are still

00:55:12.193 --> 00:55:15.697
preserved in restored views that
you will find in your textbook,

00:55:15.697 --> 00:55:16.809
in Ward-Perkins.
 

00:55:16.809 --> 00:55:20.469
One of these is located beneath
the--

00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:23.288
while this is still on the
screen, if you look at the

00:55:23.288 --> 00:55:25.505
Palatine Palace here,
just a little bit up beyond

00:55:25.505 --> 00:55:28.722
where my finger is,
there is the dining hall of the

00:55:28.722 --> 00:55:30.739
later first century A.D.
 

00:55:30.739 --> 00:55:33.840
palace that we'll look at soon,
next week.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.309
You see it there.
 

00:55:35.309 --> 00:55:39.858
And one of the buildings,
a fountain of Nero's Domus

00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:43.159
Transitoria, is located under
that.

00:55:43.159 --> 00:55:46.266
And then over here,
this temple that you see right

00:55:46.266 --> 00:55:49.625
close to the Colosseum,
is a later Hadrianic Temple of

00:55:49.625 --> 00:55:50.829
Venus and Roma.
 

00:55:50.829 --> 00:55:54.090
The domed room that I'm going
to show you, is under that.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.762
So both of these are
underground, beneath later

00:55:57.762 --> 00:55:58.800
structures.
 

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:03.144
This is a restored view from
Ward-Perkins of the fountain,

00:56:03.144 --> 00:56:06.652
the fountain court of Nero's
Domus Transitoria,

00:56:06.652 --> 00:56:10.159
and we see a number of
important features.

00:56:10.159 --> 00:56:13.780
We see an open court with a
pool, with columns around it.

00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:19.610
On the northern wall over here,
we see the fountain itself.

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:22.900
We see that what the architects
have done is create,

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.380
using a niche,
a place in that niche,

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:29.425
a series of other niches,
that served as the location of

00:56:29.425 --> 00:56:33.250
the actual water from which the
fountain emerged,

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:37.840
and the water would cascade
over this wall down here,

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.469
and then end up in a long basin
in front of it.

00:56:40.469 --> 00:56:42.130
The wall is what's most
interesting.

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.527
If you look at it,
you will see that it is

00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:48.110
essentially scalloped,
with columns in the front and

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.550
then additional columns in the
receding bays,

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:53.360
creating a kind of in-and-out
effect,

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:56.610
very similar to theater
architecture,

00:56:56.610 --> 00:57:00.010
and I show you a restored view
of a typical theater,

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:03.039
of earlier date,
just to give you a sense of

00:57:03.039 --> 00:57:04.730
what this is based on.
 

00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:08.090
You can also see that opening
up off this central court,

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.961
screened by columns,
are barrel-vaulted rooms on

00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:11.940
either side.
 

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.500
These were used as special
dining areas;

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:18.849
so special dining areas with
beautiful views out onto this

00:57:18.849 --> 00:57:20.730
fountain court on either side.
 

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:24.155
And then this restored view
also gives you a sense that the

00:57:24.155 --> 00:57:27.699
pavements were variegated,
were done in different designs.

00:57:27.699 --> 00:57:30.161
And we know that these
pavements were made out of

00:57:30.161 --> 00:57:32.929
marble and that the walls were
revetted with marble.

00:57:32.929 --> 00:57:35.530
This isn't the faux marble of
the First Style,

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:40.217
this is real marble,
and it's our first example in

00:57:40.217 --> 00:57:44.809
Rome of a room that was revetted
with marble,

00:57:44.809 --> 00:57:48.228
brought from all parts of the
world: marble brought from

00:57:48.228 --> 00:57:50.442
Africa,
marble brought from Egypt,

00:57:50.442 --> 00:57:53.750
marble brought from Asia Minor
and also from Greece,

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:58.019
in various colors,
to decorate the fountain court

00:57:58.019 --> 00:58:00.690
of Nero's Domus Transitoria.
 

00:58:00.690 --> 00:58:03.144
The other room,
and perhaps the more important

00:58:03.144 --> 00:58:05.980
of the two,
is the domed room--definitely

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.362
more important of the two--
the domed room in the Domus

00:58:09.362 --> 00:58:10.440
Transitoria of Nero.
 

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.840
And you see a restored view of
it here.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.710
What are we dealing with?
 

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:18.313
We are dealing with a structure
that is clearly based on the

00:58:18.313 --> 00:58:21.980
thermal bath at Baia and the
frigidaria of Pompeii.

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.769
It is a concrete structure.
 

00:58:23.769 --> 00:58:25.768
It looks as if it's round.
 

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:29.882
In fact, you can see a circle
inscribed in the pavement,

00:58:29.882 --> 00:58:31.230
down here below.
 

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.469
The structure is made out of
concrete.

00:58:33.469 --> 00:58:35.949
It has a dome and an
oculus.

00:58:35.949 --> 00:58:38.849
But even though it is inscribed
in a circle,

00:58:38.849 --> 00:58:40.590
if you look carefully at the
walls,

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:42.518
you will see that although they
are curved--

00:58:42.518 --> 00:58:44.760
they follow the curvature of
the circle--

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.739
there are eight sides to this
wall.

00:58:46.739 --> 00:58:51.119
So the architect is starting to
explore the idea of an octagon.

00:58:51.119 --> 00:58:55.230
This is not an octagon--it's a
circle inscribed in an octagon,

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:59.175
in a sense--but it is an
exploration into an eight-sided

00:58:59.175 --> 00:59:01.621
form,
that we're going to see is

00:59:01.621 --> 00:59:06.157
very, very important for a later
development in the Golden House

00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:06.949
of Nero.
 

00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:10.599
Also what we see here that's
very interesting,

00:59:10.599 --> 00:59:13.565
that's a further development of
the frigidarium and

00:59:13.565 --> 00:59:16.813
thermal bath idea,
is instead of this circular

00:59:16.813 --> 00:59:21.679
structure and an octagon ending
with these radiating apses,

00:59:21.679 --> 00:59:24.360
the four radiating apses that
we saw at Baia,

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.489
for example,
we see that they extend into

00:59:27.489 --> 00:59:31.617
corridors on either side,
which expands the space in a

00:59:31.617 --> 00:59:33.969
way that we have not seen
before.

00:59:33.969 --> 00:59:37.987
You see, they don't end on
either side with these apses

00:59:37.987 --> 00:59:41.085
with walls,
they expand into these long

00:59:41.085 --> 00:59:42.842
corridors,
as you can see,

00:59:42.842 --> 00:59:47.029
creating a kind of cross shape,
and certainly adding to the

00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:50.826
interesting spatial
relationships and spatial

00:59:50.826 --> 00:59:54.244
possibilities,
and the use again of vista and

00:59:54.244 --> 00:59:56.420
panorama,
as we've seen.

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.592
We see here also,
on either side here,

00:59:59.592 --> 01:00:03.365
a series of columns with metal
grills on top:

01:00:03.365 --> 01:00:07.824
so wonderful views through
those columns to what lies

01:00:07.824 --> 01:00:08.940
beyond.
 

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.039
And then on this side,
a small pool that had white

01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:14.949
marble and then colored marbles
around that.

01:00:14.949 --> 01:00:18.648
So you have to imagine again
the overall appearance of this

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:21.409
in antiquity,
when light would have streamed

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.730
through the dome of the central
space,

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:26.929
onto the walls that probably
had mosaic on them,

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:29.369
through the grills and the
columns,

01:00:29.369 --> 01:00:32.518
onto the water of the white
pool here,

01:00:32.518 --> 01:00:35.780
which was also surrounded with
variegated marbles --

01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.480
these same marbles brought from
all over the world.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.268
The view must have been quite
spectacular.

01:00:40.268 --> 01:00:45.373
This is certainly again a form
of ostentatious palatial

01:00:45.373 --> 01:00:49.059
architecture that Augustus
eschewed,

01:00:49.059 --> 01:00:52.119
but was becoming of increasing
interest to the likes of

01:00:52.119 --> 01:00:55.268
Tiberius,
Caligula, and ultimately Nero.

01:00:55.268 --> 01:00:58.230
And again, just to make the
same point again,

01:00:58.230 --> 01:01:01.398
we can trace this back to the
experiments of the

01:01:01.398 --> 01:01:05.579
frigidaria at Pompeii:
that's the Stabian Baths too,

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:09.010
the thermal bath,
the Temple of Mercury at Baia.

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:12.597
But look at the difference that
it makes when you extend those

01:01:12.597 --> 01:01:16.168
apses into corridors,
creating a much freer spatial

01:01:16.168 --> 01:01:20.561
situation and adding to the
vista and panorama idea that has

01:01:20.561 --> 01:01:23.422
been so popular,
as we've long seen,

01:01:23.422 --> 01:01:24.650
with the Romans.
 

01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:30.730
In the time that remains,
I want to turn to Nero's most

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:35.010
important architectural
commission,

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:38.233
and I can't over-emphasize the
significance of this structure

01:01:38.233 --> 01:01:41.443
that I'm going to show you now,
the so-called Domus Aurea or

01:01:41.443 --> 01:01:44.887
the Golden House of Nero,
again because of its gilded

01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:46.059
façade.
 

01:01:46.059 --> 01:01:49.264
We've already talked about the
fire that raged through Rome in

01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:50.782
64,
and that when that fire,

01:01:50.782 --> 01:01:52.889
when the smoke from that fire
died down,

01:01:52.889 --> 01:01:58.315
that Nero expropriated 300 to
350 acres in prime downtown

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:00.844
Rome,
for his own use,

01:02:00.844 --> 01:02:05.239
for a private palace,
the so-called Golden House.

01:02:05.239 --> 01:02:08.590
We see a site plan here,
also from Ward-Perkins,

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:11.701
where you can get a sense,
not only of the extent of

01:02:11.701 --> 01:02:15.184
this--
look how it covers ground from

01:02:15.184 --> 01:02:18.605
the Circus Maximus,
all the way across,

01:02:18.605 --> 01:02:22.750
to the Esquiline Hill,
as you can see so well here.

01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:25.086
So the Palatine Hill,
the Esquiline Hill,

01:02:25.086 --> 01:02:27.599
and also even the Caelian Hill
over here.

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:30.961
He dug an artificial -- or he
had his architects dig an

01:02:30.961 --> 01:02:34.760
artificial lake in the center of
this, as you can see here.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.360
And the Golden House was very
extensive.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:41.500
There's only one part of it
that remains today,

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.510
under the--or as part of the
Esquiline Hill in Rome,

01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:49.344
and we therefore call it the
Esquiline Wing of the Domus

01:02:49.344 --> 01:02:50.460
Aurea of Nero.
 

01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:55.099
This palace had an incredible
set of gimmicks,

01:02:55.099 --> 01:02:57.797
gimmicks that were so
noteworthy that the names of the

01:02:57.797 --> 01:03:01.175
architects have come down to us,
the architect and engineer who

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:02.559
are responsible for this.
 

01:03:02.559 --> 01:03:05.646
And I think it is largely they
came down to us largely because

01:03:05.646 --> 01:03:08.380
of these incredible gimmicks
that they created for this

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.090
structure.
 

01:03:09.090 --> 01:03:12.079
Their names were Severus and
Celer;

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:13.719
Severus and Celer.
 

01:03:13.719 --> 01:03:17.838
And I believe I have put their
names on the Monument List for

01:03:17.838 --> 01:03:18.250
you.
 

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.110
Yes I have, underneath the plan
of the Esquiline Wing.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:24.929
So Severus and Celer;
their names suggest to us that

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:28.050
they were Roman architects,
in fact.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:34.039
And these gimmicks included a
125-foot statue of Nero himself,

01:03:34.039 --> 01:03:36.619
a colossal stature--or the
Colossus,

01:03:36.619 --> 01:03:42.083
as it is designated here--a
colossal statue of Nero

01:03:42.083 --> 01:03:47.414
assimilated to the sun god Sol,
S-o-l, the sun god Sol,

01:03:47.414 --> 01:03:51.840
and it was done in bronze and
it was done by a famous artist,

01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:54.260
whose name we also know,
Zenodorus--

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:57.989
I've also put his name on the
Monument List for you--

01:03:57.989 --> 01:04:00.550
Zenodorus, who was a very
famous bronze caster.

01:04:00.550 --> 01:04:05.230
So Zenodorus' Colossus,
the gilded façade.

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:08.951
And what were some of the
gimmicks that Severus and Celer

01:04:08.951 --> 01:04:10.480
added to this palace?
 

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:13.516
When you ate in the dining
hall, if you were invited as a

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:17.034
special guest to eat with Nero,
while you were eating the

01:04:17.034 --> 01:04:21.119
coffered ceilings of one of the
dining rooms would drop on you

01:04:21.119 --> 01:04:24.869
all kinds of wonderful
fragrances and flower petals,

01:04:24.869 --> 01:04:26.409
while you ate.
 

01:04:26.409 --> 01:04:32.726
There was also a bath that gave
you a choice of sea water and

01:04:32.726 --> 01:04:38.730
salt water and water from the
sulfur springs of Tivoli;

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:42.835
you had your choice,
if you were bathing at Nero's

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:44.010
Domus Aurea.
 

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:46.373
And most spectacularly of all,
and I think what Severus and

01:04:46.373 --> 01:04:49.972
Celer had particular fame for,
was they created a banqueting

01:04:49.972 --> 01:04:52.768
room that had a revolving
ceiling,

01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:55.838
supposedly, a ceiling that
revolved with the heavenly

01:04:55.838 --> 01:04:56.369
bodies.
 

01:04:56.369 --> 01:04:59.829
So an incredible array of
gimmicks,

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:03.989
as I said before,
in this extraordinary palace,

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:07.090
but all of them clearly
possible vis-à-vis

01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:08.900
architecture at this time.
 

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:12.539
I'm showing you here a plan of
the Esquiline Wing.

01:05:12.539 --> 01:05:15.260
This is the one part of the
palace that survives today.

01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:18.407
We'll talk about what happened
to this palace in a later

01:05:18.407 --> 01:05:20.409
lecture, but you can see it
here.

01:05:20.409 --> 01:05:24.134
Dozens and dozens of rooms
around a five-sided court,

01:05:24.134 --> 01:05:26.570
as you can see at this
location.

01:05:26.570 --> 01:05:31.630
And then here,
what is the so-called octagonal

01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:38.039
room of Nero's Domus Aurea,
which is a remarkable room.

01:05:38.039 --> 01:05:41.538
And I think it's fair to say
the single most important room

01:05:41.538 --> 01:05:44.856
that I will have shown you thus
far this semester is the

01:05:44.856 --> 01:05:47.329
octagonal room of Nero's Domus
Aurea.

01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:50.010
And you see it here.
 

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:52.534
You can see the plan of the
octagon, and then the radiating

01:05:52.534 --> 01:05:53.449
spaces out from it.
 

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.300
I'll return to that plan in
just a moment.

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:59.088
Just to mention though,
by using Google Earth again,

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:03.472
I can show you the particular
location of the Esquiline Wing

01:06:03.472 --> 01:06:05.849
on the Esquiline Hill today.
 

01:06:05.849 --> 01:06:08.389
What happened to it
eventually--and again I'm not

01:06:08.389 --> 01:06:11.619
going to go into the details now
but I will in the future--

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:14.869
after Nero's damnatio
memoriae,

01:06:14.869 --> 01:06:18.342
some of this was destroyed and
much of it was incorporated into

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:19.349
later buildings.
 

01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:23.985
Eventually a bath of the
emperor Trajan ended up on this

01:06:23.985 --> 01:06:26.661
site,
and the emperor covered over

01:06:26.661 --> 01:06:29.380
what remained of Nero's Domus
Aurea,

01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:30.679
what hadn't been razed to the
ground,

01:06:30.679 --> 01:06:33.530
and incorporated some of it
into his later bath.

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:37.226
And, in fact,
this hemicycle of Trajan's

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:42.061
Baths is actually the
entranceway today of the Domus

01:06:42.061 --> 01:06:43.010
Aurea.
 

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.902
You can see it right here,
and you can see that the other

01:06:45.902 --> 01:06:49.105
remains of both Trajan's Baths
and of the Domus Aurea have been

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:51.119
incorporated into a modern
garden,

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:55.451
a very attractive garden where
you can wander and see some of

01:06:55.451 --> 01:06:57.039
the remains of both.
 

01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:58.793
And actually what you see
here--it just shows how amazing

01:06:58.793 --> 01:07:00.454
Google Earth is--
this circle that you see here

01:07:00.454 --> 01:07:02.297
is actually--
it has a grate on top

01:07:02.297 --> 01:07:05.588
today--but it is actually the
oculus of Nero's

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.786
octagonal room,
which is down below,

01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:09.280
which is located underground.
 

01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:12.039
So if you visit the Domus
Aurea, which is,

01:07:12.039 --> 01:07:13.480
as you can see,
right near the Colosseum,

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.028
you go into the entranceway
through the hemicycle of

01:07:17.028 --> 01:07:20.326
Trajan's later baths,
and you find yourself in a

01:07:20.326 --> 01:07:21.639
series of corridors.
 

01:07:21.639 --> 01:07:24.576
We've talked about these
corridors before,

01:07:24.576 --> 01:07:28.516
because we talked about the
paintings that Fabullus did,

01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:32.527
for Nero's Domus Aurea;
first the Third Style paintings

01:07:32.527 --> 01:07:35.010
and then the Fourth Style
paintings.

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:37.603
And you'll remember that the
Domus Aurea was described as

01:07:37.603 --> 01:07:39.998
Fabullus' prison,
because there were so many

01:07:39.998 --> 01:07:43.219
rooms and corridors that it
would take a whole lifetime to

01:07:43.219 --> 01:07:44.010
paint them.
 

01:07:44.010 --> 01:07:47.248
And you see some of those here:
barrel vaulted corridors,

01:07:47.248 --> 01:07:49.737
stuccoed over,
and then painted in the Third

01:07:49.737 --> 01:07:51.010
and Fourth styles.
 

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:55.068
Another gimmick that you see
throughout the Domus Aurea are a

01:07:55.068 --> 01:07:59.331
series of bridges that are built
to carry water from one part of

01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:01.090
the palace to another.
 

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:04.239
Another view here showing one
of the corridors,

01:08:04.239 --> 01:08:06.710
and what you see here is
something that we have not

01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.322
discussed yet,
but is the wave of the future,

01:08:09.322 --> 01:08:11.630
and that is concrete faced with
brick.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:13.699
After the fire there was
realization--

01:08:13.699 --> 01:08:17.011
the fire of 64--there was
realization that stone burned

01:08:17.011 --> 01:08:19.515
too easily,
it was not an effective facing

01:08:19.515 --> 01:08:21.832
any longer,
and that they needed to come up

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:22.920
with something else.
 

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:25.420
Brick worked better with fire.
 

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.601
So the decision was taken to
move--and this is not the tile

01:08:28.601 --> 01:08:31.460
brick in Pompeii,
this is real brick--and the

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:35.501
decision was taken to begin to
use brick-faced construction for

01:08:35.501 --> 01:08:36.738
these buildings.
 

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:40.108
At this time it was stuccoed
over, as you can see here:

01:08:40.108 --> 01:08:42.229
stucco, and then painted on
top.

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:45.140
So you wouldn't have actually
seen the brick in antiquity,

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:48.354
but we'll see it was not long
until the Romans recognized that

01:08:48.354 --> 01:08:51.359
brick was a very attractive
material in its own right,

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:52.739
and began to leave it exposed.
 

01:08:52.739 --> 01:08:53.948
But we're not there yet.
 

01:08:53.948 --> 01:08:56.807
The paintings,
the Fourth Style paintings of

01:08:56.807 --> 01:08:57.538
Fabullus.
 

01:08:57.538 --> 01:09:01.010
You'll remember this one that
we've already looked at,

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:03.475
with the reintroduction of
architectural fragments and the

01:09:03.475 --> 01:09:05.250
architectural cages in the Domus
Aurea.

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:08.010
This is the single--as I've
already said--

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.649
the single most remarkable and
important room that I've shown

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:14.570
you thus far this semester,
the octagonal room in Nero's

01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:15.779
Domus Aurea.
 

01:09:15.779 --> 01:09:20.060
You see this cross-section
plan, an axonometric view from

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.590
Ward-Perkins here.
 

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.159
And you can get a very good
sense of this.

01:09:23.159 --> 01:09:25.680
This is truly an octagonal room.
 

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.323
The experiment in the domed
room, where they had inscribed a

01:09:29.323 --> 01:09:32.663
circle into an octagon,
gave them the idea that they

01:09:32.663 --> 01:09:36.134
were going to try to make an
actual octagonal room out of

01:09:36.134 --> 01:09:38.868
concrete,
and they succeed here.

01:09:38.868 --> 01:09:40.479
You can see the eight sides of
this room.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.319
You can see it has a series of
radiating alcoves,

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:46.869
but much bigger alcoves than we
saw in the frigidaria at

01:09:46.869 --> 01:09:49.375
Pompeii,
or in the thermal bath at Baia,

01:09:49.375 --> 01:09:52.429
and differently shaped ones--
not all the same,

01:09:52.429 --> 01:09:56.729
but a couple are cross-shaped
and others are rectangular--

01:09:56.729 --> 01:09:57.729
different shapes.
 

01:09:57.729 --> 01:10:01.845
And then the axonometric view
shows you that within those

01:10:01.845 --> 01:10:06.253
alcoves there are additional
niches in some of the walls that

01:10:06.253 --> 01:10:10.222
give more of a sculptural
quality to this than has been

01:10:10.222 --> 01:10:11.840
the case before.
 

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.264
And this again was no small
feat on the part of these

01:10:15.264 --> 01:10:16.118
architects.
 

01:10:16.118 --> 01:10:20.583
Why is the Domus Aurea so
important--excuse me--the

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:24.960
octagonal room of the Domus
Aurea so important?

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.840
The octagonal room of the Domus
Aurea--

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:29.810
and I've given you a number of
bullet points here--

01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.979
represents a break from the
tyranny of the rectangle,

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:37.279
the tyranny of the rectangle
that we know from Greek and

01:10:37.279 --> 01:10:38.720
Etruscan architecture.
 

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.500
It enables vistas to be created
in every direction,

01:10:41.500 --> 01:10:45.060
and you know the importance to
Romans of vistas and panoramas.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:49.341
It creates one continuous
envelope around an interior

01:10:49.341 --> 01:10:50.000
space.
 

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.100
It fully realizes--this
development has been long in

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:57.554
coming but we're finally there--
it fully realizes the technical

01:10:57.554 --> 01:11:02.170
and expressive potentiality of
Roman concrete construction.

01:11:02.170 --> 01:11:07.538
It represents a switch of
emphasis from solids to voids --

01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:11.279
from walls and roofs that we
saw in such buildings as the

01:11:11.279 --> 01:11:15.279
Temple of Portunus,
to the insubstantial space that

01:11:15.279 --> 01:11:17.238
they enclose and shape.
 

01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:20.908
It is the interior space,
not the walls that matter now.

01:11:20.908 --> 01:11:24.118
And in this new interior
architecture,

01:11:24.118 --> 01:11:28.369
light plays a key role:
natural light that creates

01:11:28.369 --> 01:11:31.319
drama, as well as illuminates.
 

01:11:31.319 --> 01:11:36.789
The importance of the octagonal
room of Nero's Domus Aurea

01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:39.189
cannot be overstated!!!
 

01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:45.094
The octagonal room heralds the
Roman architectural revolution

01:11:45.094 --> 01:11:50.899
that we saw already beginning at
places like Palestrina,

01:11:50.899 --> 01:11:53.880
but it is finally here,
in its full-blown form;

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:58.128
whereas I said the potentiality
of the expressiveness of Roman

01:11:58.128 --> 01:12:00.149
concrete is fully realized.
 

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:02.109
This is the room itself,
as it looks today.

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:06.380
We can see the octagon,
we can see the dome.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.860
We can see the way in which the
octagon becomes the dome,

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:13.467
the eight sides and the way it
is shaped to become the dome

01:12:13.467 --> 01:12:14.090
above.
 

01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:16.788
We can see some of the niches
here.

01:12:16.788 --> 01:12:21.027
We can see the way in which the
spaces expand from the central

01:12:21.027 --> 01:12:23.875
space, and we can see niches
within those,

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:27.140
to give a greater sculptural
quality to it.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.538
And you can get a little bit of
the sense of the light here.

01:12:29.538 --> 01:12:32.015
This would have been
elaborately decorated in

01:12:32.015 --> 01:12:32.689
antiquity.
 

01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:34.140
I show you a restored view.
 

01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.287
All of those same marbles,
from Egypt, from Africa,

01:12:37.287 --> 01:12:39.051
from Asia Minor,
from Greece,

01:12:39.051 --> 01:12:42.279
all brought together here;
lots of different colors.

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:45.244
This is what those Pompeians
wished their walls actually

01:12:45.244 --> 01:12:46.000
looked like.
 

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.010
But you see real marble
revetted walls,

01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:51.399
marble pavements,
and then up above --

01:12:51.399 --> 01:12:54.881
in all kinds of colors -- and
then up above the ceiling

01:12:54.881 --> 01:12:57.010
stuccoed over and also painted.
 

01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:02.090
One can only imagine Nero
entering into this octagonal

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:05.350
room, and how he must have felt.
 

01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:10.038
And, in fact,
we have a quote from Nero,

01:13:10.038 --> 01:13:12.934
in which he says that when the
Domus Aurea in Rome was

01:13:12.934 --> 01:13:15.207
finished--
or he's reported to have said,

01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:17.578
when the Domus Aurea in Rome
was finished--

01:13:17.578 --> 01:13:19.063
he's reported to have said,
and I quote:

01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:22.204
"At last,
at last, I am going to be able

01:13:22.204 --> 01:13:25.448
to be housed like a human
being."

01:13:25.448 --> 01:13:29.029
That was the way Nero thought
about this.

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:31.016
He achieved his goal,
undoubtedly,

01:13:31.016 --> 01:13:34.569
at least for a short period of
time before he died in 68.

01:13:34.569 --> 01:13:37.020
And I believe--and I'm sure you
agree with me--

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:39.560
I believe that it is for the
Domus Aurea,

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:43.180
especially for the octagonal
room of the Domus Aurea,

01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:45.470
that Nero would have liked to
be remembered,

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:48.369
and indeed he achieved his goal.
 

01:13:48.369 --> 01:13:48.920
Thank you.

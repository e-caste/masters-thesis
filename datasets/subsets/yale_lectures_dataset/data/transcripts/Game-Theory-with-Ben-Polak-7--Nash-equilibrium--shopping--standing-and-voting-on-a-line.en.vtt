00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:08.929
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so last time we started

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.475
to study imperfect competition.
We looked at the Cournot model,

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:20.563
but the bigger theme is the
study of how firms compete

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:25.842
outside of the sort of easy
cases that you study in 115:

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:29.970
so outside of the example of
monopoly,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.159
where there is only one firm
and so there's not much

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.691
competition;
and outside the case of perfect

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:38.553
competition where there are so
many firms, it's as if each firm

00:00:38.553 --> 00:00:41.406
is a price taker.
We're going to continue with

00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:44.734
that today, and in fact you're
going to continue with it on

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.009
into the homework.
So last time,

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:51.601
we looked at Cournot.
It was the model we started

00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:53.722
with.
We looked at two firms

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:57.095
competing in quantities.
And just to review a little bit

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.889
what we did last time,
the kind of exercise there--so

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.033
I think,
is this right,

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.890
I think probably went a little
fast last time.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.938
I was kicking myself afterwards.
People can nod or shake their

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:07.738
heads.
I think I went a bit fast,

00:01:07.738 --> 00:01:10.514
so I'm sorry for that.
If there was a time to go too

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:13.554
fast it was probably last time,
because it turns out this is

00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:16.079
something that's covered well in
the textbook,

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.599
so it's covered in chapter six
of the textbook.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:22.613
But the kind of exercise we did
last time is a useful exercise

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:25.180
for those of you who are Econ
majors.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.866
The way we solved that Cournot
model was we did three kinds of

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:31.215
things.
We did something very nerdy,

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:34.440
namely, we just played with
calculus and algebra.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.722
That was sort of mathy.
We did something a little bit

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:40.152
less nerdy, that is,
we drew some pictures that

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.992
represented what we'd found.
And we did a third thing,

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:45.973
which we tried to match this up
to the economic intuition about

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.994
monopoly,
and perfect competition,

00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:49.800
and demand curves,
and so on.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.977
And this exercise of being able
to work in these three different

00:01:52.977 --> 00:01:56.139
modes, economic intuition,
graphs, and kind of nerdy high

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:59.462
school math is a lot of what we
want to get you used to as

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:01.953
Economic Majors,
just to be able to translate

00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:04.373
easily between those.
Again, I apologize for going

00:02:04.373 --> 00:02:06.706
too fast but it's still a useful
exercise I think,

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:08.419
so have a look at it in the
book.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.228
Now back to the lessons and
away from the nerdiness a

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:14.413
second, what did we learn?
Well at the end of the day we

00:02:14.413 --> 00:02:17.530
learned that in the Cournot
Equilibrium, things were,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.295
as we perhaps might have
anticipated--things sat

00:02:21.295 --> 00:02:24.340
naturally between the extreme
cases.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.867
So the amount of output
produced by the industry was

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:29.742
somewhere between the case that
would be under monopoly and

00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:32.326
under perfect competition.
It was more than under

00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:34.370
monopoly, less than perfect
competition.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.157
Prices in the industry,
if we'd gone back and checked,

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:39.483
would sit between.
They would be lower than the

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:41.439
monopoly prices,
but higher than the perfect

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:44.135
competitive prices.
Industry profits would be in

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:45.639
between.
Industry profits would be less

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.722
than monopoly.
They must be less than

00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:48.229
monopoly, since that's the
highest they could ever be.

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.464
And they're higher than perfect
competition, which of course,

00:02:51.464 --> 00:02:54.174
has zero profits in this case.
Consumer surplus,

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:57.069
the benefits flowing to
consumers lie in between.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.225
So in fact the model,
in addition to the sort of

00:02:59.225 --> 00:03:01.565
nerdiness of the model,
it ended up with a result we

00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:03.934
kind of believe in.
If you have imperfect

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:07.563
competition, it's somewhere
between perfect competition and

00:03:07.563 --> 00:03:10.580
no competition.
But, what's the "but"?

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.584
The "but" is that there are
other ways we could model

00:03:13.584 --> 00:03:16.358
imperfect competition,
and, as we're going to see

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.669
today, they yield different
answers.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:24.939
So the first thing we're going
to do today is look at a

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:31.092
different form of competition
which is called Bertrand

00:03:31.092 --> 00:03:38.531
competition.
The Cournot was competing in

00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:48.099
quantities and Bertrand is
competing in prices.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.288
Just a quick check and this is
not for the camera,

00:03:50.288 --> 00:03:52.790
how many of you have seen
Bertrand competition before?

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.839
So, a good many of you.
So this is going to be review

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:57.452
still again, and for those of
you for whom it isn't review

00:03:57.452 --> 00:04:00.243
don't worry.
We'll do this relatively

00:04:00.243 --> 00:04:05.240
quickly but I hope I won't rush
it like I did last time.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.205
If it's any consolation,
when I feel I've rushed a

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:08.650
lecture, I have a sleepless
night.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.666
So if you had a sleepless night
because you're worried about it,

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.599
I'm having a sleepless night
too about that.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.885
So there's two firms,
just as there was before,

00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:22.670
and just as there was
before--so the players are those

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.129
two firms,
and just as there was last

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:33.250
time, they're producing an
identical product.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.909
So the products we mentioned
last time were Coke and Pepsi,

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.506
but you could think of other
products that are pretty much

00:04:40.506 --> 00:04:44.524
identical.
Just as last time,

00:04:44.524 --> 00:04:53.752
we're going to assume that
costs are constant marginal

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.343
costs.
We'll assume that constant

00:04:56.343 --> 00:04:58.470
marginal cost just as it was
last time is equal to C.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.623
Just to remind those people who
are not Economics Majors what

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:04.566
that means, it means if I
produce 1 unit then it costs me

00:05:04.566 --> 00:05:08.146
C to produce,
if I produce two units it costs

00:05:08.146 --> 00:05:11.180
me 2C, 100 units a 100C and so
on.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.360
Now what's different here from
last time?

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.149
I've already told you but I'll
repeat it.

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.751
This time, however,
instead of setting quantities,

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.831
instead of just deciding how
much Coke and Pepsi to produce

00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:24.177
and spewing it out in the market
and letting prices take care of

00:05:24.177 --> 00:05:27.353
themselves,
this time the firms are going

00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:31.899
to set prices and let quantities
take care of themselves.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:40.149
So the strategy sets this time
are prices.

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:43.643
Again, so as we don't get
confused, normally we use S for

00:05:43.643 --> 00:05:46.699
strategy, but let's use P since
they're prices.

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:51.347
So they're going to P1,
will the price of Firm 1,

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:54.930
and P2 will be the price of
Firm 2.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.045
This strategy set--formally,
let's just simplify it

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:04.230
here--let's assume that for each
Firm i they can set their price

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.510
anything bigger than 0 and
anything less than 1,

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:13.595
just to keep life simple.
So this is a little bit more

00:06:13.595 --> 00:06:16.974
realistic perhaps.
Perhaps more realistic to think

00:06:16.974 --> 00:06:20.865
of firms actually thinking about
what prices to set and then

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:25.019
adjusting the quantities they
actually ship based on demand.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.388
Depends on--I don't want to be
too rigorous about that because

00:06:27.388 --> 00:06:28.980
you could imagine the other way
around,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:33.585
but if you talk to managers
this sounds more realistic,

00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:37.680
at least for retail goods like
Coke and Pepsi.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.343
So we know how prices are set,
they're set by the firms,

00:06:41.343 --> 00:06:45.339
so the next question is where
do the quantities come from?

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.709
So how do--where do the
quantities from?

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:48.269
And they're going to come from
demand.

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:53.312
And let me use a big Q(P) to be
the total quantity

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:59.589
produced--sorry--the total
quantity demanded in the market.

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:04.487
So this will be total quantity
of goods produced by Firm 1 and

00:07:04.487 --> 00:07:08.100
goods produced by Firm 2 that
are consumed.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.259
So this is the total quantity
of Coke plus Pepsi.

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:14.292
Now we're going to--notice
there's no subscript on this P

00:07:14.292 --> 00:07:18.178
and you'll see why in a second.
So we'll assume just to make

00:07:18.178 --> 00:07:22.750
life simple, that the total
quantity produced is 1 –P.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.563
And I'll say this and then
write it more carefully,

00:07:26.563 --> 00:07:29.689
where P is the lower of the two
prices.

00:07:29.689 --> 00:07:35.319
So total quantity demand is 1
-P where P is the lower of the

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.533
two prices.
Now to make that

00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:41.064
lower-of-the-two-prices comment
a little bit more rigorous,

00:07:41.064 --> 00:07:44.290
let's figure out what the
demand actually is for these

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:49.300
firms.
So what's going on here?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.453
So let's look at the demand for
Firm 1, which is going to end up

00:07:55.453 --> 00:07:58.970
being the quantity that they
sell.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.800
So that's going to be Q1 and
what's that going to be?

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.910
Well it's going to 1 -P1 if
they're the low price firm.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.053
So if P1 is less than P2--so if
they're the low price firm--if

00:08:13.053 --> 00:08:17.129
Coke is the low price firm,
only Coke sells in the market.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:22.413
There's no Pepsi in the market
and 1 -P1 quantity of Coke is

00:08:22.413 --> 00:08:27.391
sold.
It's going to be 0 if P1 is

00:08:27.391 --> 00:08:32.333
bigger than P2.
So if Pepsi is the low price

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:36.470
drink in the market then no Coke
is sold at all.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:44.809
It's going to be (1 -P1)/2 in
the case where Coke and Pepsi

00:08:44.809 --> 00:08:49.555
cost exactly the same.
These should really be--realize

00:08:49.555 --> 00:08:51.059
that this is not exactly
realistic.

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:53.473
We're making a lot of very
strong assumptions here,

00:08:53.473 --> 00:08:55.789
but nevertheless,
it's going to be instructive to

00:08:55.789 --> 00:08:57.864
look at this model.
So we've got the firms,

00:08:57.864 --> 00:08:59.876
they're the players,
I know what their strategies

00:08:59.876 --> 00:09:01.852
are,
I know a little bit about the

00:09:01.852 --> 00:09:04.869
structure of the market,
and I still need to tell you

00:09:04.869 --> 00:09:07.996
what payoffs are.
And just as last time the firms

00:09:07.996 --> 00:09:10.470
are going to try and maximize
profits.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.320
So what's the profit for Firm 1
going to be?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.958
I won't bother to write it
separately for Firm 2,

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:20.582
it's going to be the quantity
it sells times the price it gets

00:09:20.582 --> 00:09:24.728
for that quantity,
minus that quantity it sells

00:09:24.728 --> 00:09:29.419
times the cost it incurs in
producing that quantity.

00:09:29.419 --> 00:09:35.438
So again, for Firm 1 it's the
quantity it sells times the

00:09:35.438 --> 00:09:41.241
price, this is its revenue,
minus the quantity it sells

00:09:41.241 --> 00:09:45.539
times C, the cost,
this is his cost.

00:09:45.539 --> 00:09:55.340
I can rewrite that a little bit
more simply as Q1[P1 -C].

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.132
Where Q1, let's keep it in
square brackets,

00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:06.578
this Q1 is this object here.
Does everyone understand what's

00:10:06.578 --> 00:10:07.981
going on?
I mean the algebra doesn't

00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:10.046
really help the intuition here.
The intuition is pretty

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:11.967
straightforward.
Coke and Pepsi are producing

00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:13.870
this stuff.
They're setting prices.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.970
If Pepsi is the low price then
Coke sells nothing.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:21.053
If Coke is the low price it
sells this amount and its

00:10:21.053 --> 00:10:23.840
profits are basically given by
this equation.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.289
It's basically just revenues
minus costs.

00:10:28.289 --> 00:10:31.502
So what we want to do is we
want to figure out what the Nash

00:10:31.502 --> 00:10:33.679
Equilibrium looks like in this
market.

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:37.604
Just before we go any further,
notice that really this is the

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:40.220
same basic market we looked at
before.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.000
Both times there's a demand
curve out there.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.451
In one model we thought of the
firms setting quantities and the

00:10:46.451 --> 00:10:49.388
market determining prices,
and here we have the firms

00:10:49.388 --> 00:10:52.250
setting prices and the market
determining quantities,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:57.535
but the basic underlying
economic structure of this is

00:10:57.535 --> 00:11:01.432
very, very similar.
So to find the Nash Equilibrium

00:11:01.432 --> 00:11:03.990
we're going to have to find best
responses.

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:08.394
So what we're going to do
together is to figure out what

00:11:08.394 --> 00:11:13.120
these best responses look like
and let's try and do that.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.313
So I want to figure out the
best response of Firm 1 as a

00:11:17.313 --> 00:11:20.440
function of the price chosen by
Firm 2.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.203
Best price for Firm 1 to choose
given that Firm 2 is choosing

00:11:25.203 --> 00:11:27.583
P2.
I want to do this carefully and

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:31.357
slowly, and before I even start,
let me point out in passing

00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:34.299
that calculus is not going to
help us here.

00:11:34.299 --> 00:11:36.555
So for those of you who are
nerdy enough to understand the

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:37.940
next sentence let me just say
it.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.441
This is a discontinuous payoff
function, so differentiating

00:11:42.441 --> 00:11:46.058
isn't going to get you very far.
For people whom that didn't

00:11:46.058 --> 00:11:47.289
mean anything,
it doesn't matter.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:51.210
We're not going to calculus
today.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.019
Okay, so there were different
cases to think about.

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:59.891
So one case to think about is
what if the other firm,

00:11:59.891 --> 00:12:04.633
you're Coke,
what if Pepsi is pricing below

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:06.508
cost?
You're Coke,

00:12:06.508 --> 00:12:10.583
what should you price as if
you're trying to maximize your

00:12:10.583 --> 00:12:12.461
profits?
Somebody try and wave their

00:12:12.461 --> 00:12:14.159
hands in the air if they know
the answer.

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:18.409
Pepsi's pricing below cost,
what's your best response?

00:12:18.409 --> 00:12:21.710
The guy in there,
do you want to shout out?

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.542
Student: Just get out of
the market because it's not

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:24.679
worth it for you to sell
anything.

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:26.463
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, I've forgotten your name,

00:12:26.463 --> 00:12:28.250
I should know it by now.
Your name is?

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.080
Student: Sudipta.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.279
Sudipta says get out of the
market.

00:12:31.279 --> 00:12:34.113
If the other guy is pricing
below costs, you don't want to

00:12:34.113 --> 00:12:36.299
sell anything,
that's the right intuition.

00:12:36.299 --> 00:12:40.519
How in this game do I "get out
of the market?"

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:42.785
You're absolutely right,
I don't want to be involved in

00:12:42.785 --> 00:12:45.009
this market if the other guy is
selling below cost.

00:12:45.009 --> 00:12:46.980
How do I operationalize that in
this game?

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.413
How do I actually manage?
Ale is there somebody here,

00:12:50.413 --> 00:12:53.759
just wait for the mike a second
and now shout it out.

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:55.875
Student: You could set
your price above his price and

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.667
then no one will buy.
Professor Ben Polak: The

00:12:57.667 --> 00:12:59.009
answer was set your price above
his price.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:03.572
So the other guy is pricing
below costs, the way which I

00:13:03.572 --> 00:13:08.299
avoid making losses is to set my
price above his price.

00:13:08.299 --> 00:13:10.940
Let's just make sure we
understand this,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.798
if the other guy is selling
below cost, the only way I can

00:13:14.798 --> 00:13:17.980
make any sales is to price below
his price.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:22.167
I will then make sales but each
of those sales I'm making a loss

00:13:22.167 --> 00:13:23.983
on.
I don't want to make losses,

00:13:23.983 --> 00:13:26.951
so I just "get out of the
market," and the way I "get out

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:29.760
of the market," is by pricing
above the other guy.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.477
Everyone understand that?
Okay, so now more

00:13:34.477 --> 00:13:39.343
interestingly,
we leave a little gap here,

00:13:39.343 --> 00:13:45.039
what if the other guy is
pricing above costs?

00:13:45.039 --> 00:13:46.838
What do I want to do if the
other guy is pricing above

00:13:46.838 --> 00:13:49.355
costs?
Can I get the guy with the

00:13:49.355 --> 00:13:54.019
beard here, shout it out.
Student: You set price

00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:57.190
below his but above or equal to
cost.

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.109
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, so if the other guy is

00:14:00.109 --> 00:14:03.413
pricing above costs,
I want to set prices below his

00:14:03.413 --> 00:14:08.179
so that I steal the whole of the
market and make profits on those

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.755
sales.
So where is--Suppose he's

00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:14.491
pricing--We'll say the prices
are between 0 and 1,

00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:18.836
suppose he's pricing at .8,
what would be a good price for

00:14:18.836 --> 00:14:23.259
me to set?
Same guy, yeah.

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:25.388
Student: As small an
amount below his price as you

00:14:25.388 --> 00:14:28.500
can do.
Professor Ben Polak: As

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:32.379
small an amount below his price
as I can.

00:14:32.379 --> 00:14:36.179
So basically what I'm going to
do here is I'm going to set my

00:14:36.179 --> 00:14:38.822
price to equal his price,
minus a little bit,

00:14:38.822 --> 00:14:41.669
and I'll use the letter ε
to mean just a little bit.

00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:45.223
I'll just undercut him a little
bit and by just undercutting him

00:14:45.223 --> 00:14:47.523
a little bit,
I'm going to get the whole of

00:14:47.523 --> 00:14:50.730
the market and I'll make as much
money as I can on those sales.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.844
Now that's almost right.
That's kind of ninety percent

00:14:56.844 --> 00:14:59.009
of right, but it's not quite
right.

00:14:59.009 --> 00:15:01.350
I need to be a little bit
careful.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.049
Now why do I need to be a
little bit careful?

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:04.690
This is almost right but it's
not quite right.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.994
Yeah, same guy.
Student: You want it,

00:15:08.994 --> 00:15:10.980
your price, to be at or above
cost.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:12.371
Professor Ben Polak:
That's certainly true,

00:15:12.371 --> 00:15:14.870
okay.
So that's true, fair enough.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.293
So I want to make sure this
ε is not so big,

00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:20.070
so as it pushes me below cost,
that's certainly true.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:25.164
That's correct.
There's another little issue

00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:27.048
here.
So here's the other issue,

00:15:27.048 --> 00:15:29.656
there's a price in this market,
we might want to think of as

00:15:29.656 --> 00:15:31.909
the kind of focal price as an
interesting price,

00:15:31.909 --> 00:15:37.399
and that's the price at which,
the price I would choose were I

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:40.430
the monopolist.
Suppose the other guy didn't

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.377
exist, suppose Pepsi didn't
exist, so Coke has the whole

00:15:43.377 --> 00:15:45.950
market, then we would solve out
this problem.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.820
We would solve out what the
monopoly price is.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.700
That's an exercise you did in
115.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:57.095
And notice that if Pepsi has
priced above the monopoly price,

00:15:57.095 --> 00:16:02.581
suppose Pepsi has priced this
good so high that it's above the

00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:06.587
monopoly price,
then, as the gentleman said,

00:16:06.587 --> 00:16:11.509
I can capture the whole market
by pricing just below Pepsi.

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:14.392
However, then I'll have the
whole market,

00:16:14.392 --> 00:16:18.787
it's as if I'm a monopolist but
suddenly I'm pricing above the

00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:21.669
monopoly price,
that can't be right.

00:16:21.669 --> 00:16:23.684
I never want to price above the
monopoly price,

00:16:23.684 --> 00:16:26.224
because I know the monopoly
price, when I'm the monopolist,

00:16:26.224 --> 00:16:28.020
is the most profit I could ever
make.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:30.410
Is that right?
So we need to be a little bit

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:33.900
careful.
This answer that says I just

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:39.110
undercut Pepsi,
that's true provided that Pepsi

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.639
hasn't gone above the monopoly
price.

00:16:43.639 --> 00:16:50.149
If he's gone above the monopoly
price we need to be a little bit

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.899
more careful.
If P2 is actually above the

00:16:54.899 --> 00:17:00.349
monopoly price,
then what's my best response in

00:17:00.349 --> 00:17:03.129
that case?
What's my best response in that

00:17:03.129 --> 00:17:05.759
case?
Yeah, can we get Katie who's in

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:08.444
green there, shout out.
Student: Pricing at the

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:09.383
monopoly price.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:17:09.383 --> 00:17:11.992
Pricing at the monopoly price.
So if Pepsi is dumb enough to

00:17:11.992 --> 00:17:15.584
price above monopoly,
sure I will undercut Pepsi but

00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:18.190
I won't undercut Pepsi by a
penny,

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.838
I'll undercut Pepsi all the way
down to the monopoly price and

00:17:20.838 --> 00:17:22.980
make monopoly profits.
I'll be very happy.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:25.625
I'll be wondering what on earth
is Pepsi up to,

00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:29.563
but that's fine.
So here my best response is to

00:17:29.563 --> 00:17:35.143
price at the monopoly price.
There's one other possibility

00:17:35.143 --> 00:17:41.073
here I've missed which is what
if Pepsi prices at marginal cost

00:17:41.073 --> 00:17:44.067
itself?
That's the one missing case

00:17:44.067 --> 00:17:46.142
here.
What if Pepsi prices at

00:17:46.142 --> 00:17:51.397
marginal cost?
What's my best response in this

00:17:51.397 --> 00:17:53.632
case?
Pepsi's pricing exactly at

00:17:53.632 --> 00:17:55.820
marginal cost,
what's my best response?

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.326
Yeah, wait for the mike.
This is Henry I think,

00:17:59.326 --> 00:18:01.003
shout out.
Student: To price at

00:18:01.003 --> 00:18:02.448
marginal cost as well.
Professor Ben Polak: I

00:18:02.448 --> 00:18:03.390
could price at marginal cost as
well.

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:06.798
How much profits will I make if
I price at marginal cost as

00:18:06.798 --> 00:18:07.888
well?
Zero profits,

00:18:07.888 --> 00:18:10.498
I'll make zero profits,
so that certainly is a best

00:18:10.498 --> 00:18:12.900
response, pricing at marginal
cost as well.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.190
What else would be a best
response?

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:18.317
That's correct,
but what else would be a best

00:18:18.317 --> 00:18:20.279
response?
Price above that.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:24.768
It doesn't really matter,
as long as I don't price below

00:18:24.768 --> 00:18:28.440
it, I'm not going to make any
money anyway.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.960
If I price below it I'm going
to lose money.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.913
So this best response actually
is a pretty complicated object,

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:36.026
and we could,
if we're going to go like we

00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:38.206
did last time,
we could take the time to draw

00:18:38.206 --> 00:18:40.782
this thing,
but it's a bit of a mess so I

00:18:40.782 --> 00:18:43.380
won't worry about doing that
right now.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.549
So the best response is
actually pretty complicated.

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:48.238
Even though the best response
is pretty complicated--and by

00:18:48.238 --> 00:18:51.019
the way, obviously the things
are symmetric for Player II.

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:54.090
Even though these best
responses are pretty complicated

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.388
it turns out that there's only
one Nash Equilibrium in this

00:18:57.388 --> 00:18:59.480
game.
What's the Nash Equilibrium?

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.560
Somebody, what's the Nash
Equilibrium?

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.256
Raise your hands.
All you guys,

00:19:02.256 --> 00:19:05.542
there's a huge number of hands
who said they had seen it

00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:08.769
before.
Who saw this model before?

00:19:08.769 --> 00:19:11.350
Fewer hands go up when they
know there's a question coming.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:14.328
There's a different incentive.
Who remembers what the Nash

00:19:14.328 --> 00:19:16.048
Equilibrium is?
Yeah, there's a guy,

00:19:16.048 --> 00:19:17.890
Tae there's a guy right by you
there.

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.790
Student: At C.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:20.560
Shout out, even I can't hear
you.

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.977
Student: At C.
Professor Ben Polak: At

00:19:23.977 --> 00:19:29.413
C okay, so the Nash Equilibrium
here, the Nash Equilibrium is

00:19:29.413 --> 00:19:34.940
for both firms to set their
prices equal to marginal cost.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.595
You can check that both firms
are then playing a best

00:19:37.595 --> 00:19:42.117
response, so that's all right.
If Firm II is charging C,

00:19:42.117 --> 00:19:48.470
then a best response for Firm 1
is to set price equal to

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.289
marginal costs,
and if Firm 1 is pricing at

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:55.189
marginal cost,
then conversely a best response

00:19:55.189 --> 00:19:57.960
for Firm 2 is to price at
marginal cost.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:01.583
Slightly harder exercise is to
check that nothing else is a

00:20:01.583 --> 00:20:03.972
Nash Equilibrium.
Well let's think about that for

00:20:03.972 --> 00:20:09.372
a second.
Suppose Firm 1 is pricing at

00:20:09.372 --> 00:20:19.218
marginal cost and Firm 2 is
pricing at something higher,

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:26.200
at C + 3ε,
a little bit higher.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:32.132
Suppose Firm 1 is pricing at
marginal cost and Firm 2 is

00:20:32.132 --> 00:20:37.849
pricing at C + 3ε,
is this a Nash Equilibrium?

00:20:37.849 --> 00:20:42.550
Let's think about Firm 2,
first of all,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:48.240
is Firm 2 playing a best
response to Firm 1?

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.660
So I claim it is,
let's just check carefully.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.112
Firm 1 is pricing at marginal
cost, the best response if the

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:59.641
other guy is pricing at marginal
cost is to price at marginal

00:20:59.641 --> 00:21:02.041
cost or above.
Now this is marginal cost or

00:21:02.041 --> 00:21:03.380
above so this is the best
response.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:08.430
So if Firm 2 is playing a best
response, this is a best

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.640
response for Firm 2,
given that P1 is at C.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.280
What's the problem here?
Nevertheless I claim this is

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.013
not a Nash Equilibrium.
Why is it not a Nash

00:21:17.013 --> 00:21:19.160
Equilibrium?
Who has an incentive to deviate?

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.500
Can we get the guy way at the
back by the door.

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.259
Go ahead;
shout out.

00:21:25.259 --> 00:21:28.559
Student: Firm 1's going
to want to produce at C +

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:30.624
2ε.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:21:30.624 --> 00:21:33.070
Exactly, exactly.
This is not a best response.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:42.251
This is not a best response.
The reason is that the best

00:21:42.251 --> 00:21:47.186
response for Firm 1,
if Firm 2 is charging C +

00:21:47.186 --> 00:21:52.559
3ε is to price at C +
2ε, thank you.

00:21:52.559 --> 00:22:00.204
So it turns out it's pretty to
check that this is the only Nash

00:22:00.204 --> 00:22:06.302
Equilibrium in the game.
Now what's the lesson we're

00:22:06.302 --> 00:22:10.791
going to draw from this?
Well, as an exercise in Game

00:22:10.791 --> 00:22:13.250
Theory, that really wasn't very
hard.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.824
As an exercise in finding Nash
Equilibrium, by this stage in

00:22:15.824 --> 00:22:17.963
the course most of you are
looking at that saying,

00:22:17.963 --> 00:22:20.410
that wasn't hard.
So what's the point here?

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:25.445
The point is that in this game
in which firms competed in

00:22:25.445 --> 00:22:31.019
prices, even though there were
only two firms in the market,

00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:35.044
only one firm more than
monopoly, we get a dramatically

00:22:35.044 --> 00:22:38.099
different result than we had
last time.

00:22:38.099 --> 00:22:41.926
In particular,
we find that prices in the

00:22:41.926 --> 00:22:45.369
market are equal to marginal
cost.

00:22:45.369 --> 00:22:51.450
We find that profit in
equilibrium is equal to what?

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.277
Zero.
And we find there's lots of

00:22:54.277 --> 00:22:56.695
consumer surplus because the
prices are really as low as they

00:22:56.695 --> 00:22:59.126
ever could be.
In fact, the outcome here,

00:22:59.126 --> 00:23:02.819
this equilibrium here is for
all intents and purposes,

00:23:02.819 --> 00:23:05.924
the same equilibrium we would
have had had there been

00:23:05.924 --> 00:23:09.566
thousands of firms in the market
and had this been a perfectly

00:23:09.566 --> 00:23:12.881
competitive market.
So even though there's only two

00:23:12.881 --> 00:23:16.390
firms here, with price
competition, identical products,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:20.521
we end up with an outcome that
looks exactly like perfect

00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:24.799
competition, except for the fact
there's only two firms.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:42.091
The outcome is like perfect
competition even though there's

00:23:42.091 --> 00:23:48.980
only two firms.
That's a pretty surprising

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.189
result.
It would suggest,

00:23:50.189 --> 00:23:51.450
think of this as a policy
thing.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.255
So if you believe this model,
if you think is really an

00:23:54.255 --> 00:23:57.241
accurate model of society,
and you're a regulator working

00:23:57.241 --> 00:24:00.100
in the Department of Justice,
or you're a judge trying to

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.086
judge some monopoly case,
or you're a commissioner on the

00:24:03.086 --> 00:24:05.998
European Court or whatever
trying to judge some competition

00:24:05.998 --> 00:24:07.905
case,
all you'd worry about is

00:24:07.905 --> 00:24:11.793
getting one competitor in each
market, two firms in each market

00:24:11.793 --> 00:24:16.224
and you'd be done.
You wouldn't worry about entry

00:24:16.224 --> 00:24:22.768
beyond two.
Now my guess is we don't

00:24:22.768 --> 00:24:27.323
believe that.
We'll come back to that in a

00:24:27.323 --> 00:24:30.199
second, but let me make a
different remark before we get

00:24:30.199 --> 00:24:32.200
there.
Is it me doing that.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:38.630
Let me move this down.
Still doing it okay.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:50.388
It's probably the wire.
Let me just remove it,

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:53.670
I'll shout.
Okay, I'm going to shout now,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:57.650
can people still hear me?
Yep, okay thank you.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:00.970
So we'll have to turn down the
other mike a bit.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.274
So another thing to remark here
is, even though we looked at

00:25:05.274 --> 00:25:09.359
essentially the same market as
we looked at last time,

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:12.515
and we didn't make any really
significant change--we just said

00:25:12.515 --> 00:25:15.670
instead of thinking of them
pricing and setting quantities,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.914
think of them setting prices
(happens to be just thought

00:25:18.914 --> 00:25:22.630
experiments)--we ended up with a
radically different outcome.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:34.427
So another lesson here is:
the same setting as last time,

00:25:34.427 --> 00:25:44.539
as Cournot, but with a
different strategy set,

00:25:44.539 --> 00:25:52.816
a different way of thinking
about what they're doing led to

00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:58.470
a very different outcome.
That's worrying.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:01.435
It's worrying because you can't
go away feeling comfortable

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.002
about this.
You can't think that it really

00:26:04.002 --> 00:26:07.872
could make so much difference in
the real world how prices and

00:26:07.872 --> 00:26:09.634
quantities,
and welfare,

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:13.715
and profit is going to work out
depending on some thought

00:26:13.715 --> 00:26:17.650
experiment about how I think
about my strategy set.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:22.450
So there's a little worry going
in about not just this example

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.992
but about the course,
about the whole theme of

00:26:25.992 --> 00:26:30.910
learning Game Theory.
So what's going to save us here?

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:34.783
What's going to save us is if
we inject a little bit more

00:26:34.783 --> 00:26:38.656
reality back in the model,
we're going to get back a more

00:26:38.656 --> 00:26:41.537
sensible result.
So what we're going to do now

00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:44.791
is we're going to relax some of
the assumptions of this Bertrand

00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:47.269
model and it's going to do two
things for us.

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:50.339
First, it's going to give us an
outcome that we believe.

00:26:50.339 --> 00:26:53.584
The outcome we believe I think,
is that imperfect competition

00:26:53.584 --> 00:26:56.234
should look something between
monopoly and perfect

00:26:56.234 --> 00:26:58.411
competition,
it shouldn't look like perfect

00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:00.411
competition.
I think most of us don't

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:03.514
believe that two firms is enough
to make it a perfect

00:27:03.514 --> 00:27:07.213
competition, that the regulator
shouldn't worry about the third

00:27:07.213 --> 00:27:09.334
firm.
The second thing it's going to

00:27:09.334 --> 00:27:11.418
do, from a more theoretical
point of view,

00:27:11.418 --> 00:27:14.315
is it's going to suggest to us
that actually things aren't

00:27:14.315 --> 00:27:18.242
quite as bad we thought.
In fact, if we model this more

00:27:18.242 --> 00:27:23.230
carefully, we'll get roughly the
same prediction either way.

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:25.769
So what's the assumption we're
going to change?

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:29.288
Well before I say that,
I should say I'm not going to

00:27:29.288 --> 00:27:32.065
change it, you are.
So rather than go through this

00:27:32.065 --> 00:27:34.459
again a whole third time,
I've gone through it once in

00:27:34.459 --> 00:27:38.171
quantities and once in prices,
I'm going to get you guys to do

00:27:38.171 --> 00:27:42.400
it this time by having you do it
on a homework assignment.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:44.671
Well why?
Partly because I think it's a

00:27:44.671 --> 00:27:46.535
good exercise,
but also I don't want this

00:27:46.535 --> 00:27:48.539
class to be a class where you
sit there,

00:27:48.539 --> 00:27:51.487
with your cup of Willoughby's
coffee if needed to keep awake,

00:27:51.487 --> 00:27:54.188
and you watch me solve models
because that's not how you

00:27:54.188 --> 00:27:55.929
learn.
What I want this class to be is

00:27:55.929 --> 00:27:58.105
a class where at least
sometimes, like on this homework

00:27:58.105 --> 00:28:00.107
assignment,
I set up a model for you,

00:28:00.107 --> 00:28:03.213
set up the story for you,
and then you have to actually

00:28:03.213 --> 00:28:06.722
figure out how do I set this up
properly and how do I solve it

00:28:06.722 --> 00:28:08.480
out?
Because at the end of the day,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.837
if Game Theory is going to be
useful for you in your later

00:28:10.837 --> 00:28:12.617
lives,
whether it's in dating or in

00:28:12.617 --> 00:28:15.029
running a company or whatever it
happens to be,

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:19.250
you need to able to go from the
story to the model.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.081
Having said that,
I'll tell you what the homework

00:28:21.081 --> 00:28:24.573
assignment's going to be about.
The assumption we're going to

00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:28.269
change is the idea that products
are identical.

00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:38.008
So we're going to look at a
case, I'll use a new board,

00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:44.500
where products are
differentiated.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.771
I'm going to claim that
assuming that products are not

00:28:48.771 --> 00:28:53.043
identical, is a pretty safe
assumption for most of the

00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:54.865
world,
for most things that you're

00:28:54.865 --> 00:29:01.189
going to see in the world.
So we're going to look at what

00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:07.559
are called differentiated
products.

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:11.136
In particular,
we're going to look at a

00:29:11.136 --> 00:29:16.878
particular version of this that
we're going to call the linear

00:29:16.878 --> 00:29:19.518
city model.
So what do I mean by products

00:29:19.518 --> 00:29:21.828
being differentiated?
So I started off with an

00:29:21.828 --> 00:29:24.586
example that's pretty bad for
this story, namely,

00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:26.643
Coke and Pepsi.
Now be honest,

00:29:26.643 --> 00:29:30.298
how many of you in a blind
taste test can taste the

00:29:30.298 --> 00:29:34.320
difference between ordinary Coke
and ordinary Pepsi?

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.164
Quite a few.
That's good for my case,

00:29:36.164 --> 00:29:39.130
so a number of you think those
are different products.

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:41.087
So a number of you,
even if the price was just a

00:29:41.087 --> 00:29:43.627
tiny bit different might have a
preference for one rather than

00:29:43.627 --> 00:29:44.978
the other,
so without getting in trouble

00:29:44.978 --> 00:29:46.489
by putting the camera on you,
how many of you would have a

00:29:46.489 --> 00:29:48.527
preference,
if the prices were essentially

00:29:48.527 --> 00:29:51.749
the same how many of you would
have a strict preference for

00:29:51.749 --> 00:29:53.781
Pepsi?
How many would have a strict

00:29:53.781 --> 00:29:56.775
preference for Coke?
How many would have a strict

00:29:56.775 --> 00:29:59.597
preference for Diet Coke?
That's amazing,

00:29:59.597 --> 00:30:05.250
that stuff's--oh never mind.
Okay but you're making my point.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:11.769
The point I'm trying to make
is, products are not identical.

00:30:11.769 --> 00:30:14.392
For the most part there's a
little bit of difference between

00:30:14.392 --> 00:30:16.569
products and that's actually
going to--that is,

00:30:16.569 --> 00:30:19.458
if we inject that little bit of
realism into the world--it's

00:30:19.458 --> 00:30:21.903
actually going to help us.
So what we would like,

00:30:21.903 --> 00:30:24.772
what would we like?
We would like a model in which

00:30:24.772 --> 00:30:28.747
firms set prices because for the
most part we think firms do set

00:30:28.747 --> 00:30:31.839
prices not quantities:
not always but for the most

00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:34.165
part.
But we'd like a model that

00:30:34.165 --> 00:30:37.555
yields an outcome that
looks--that when you only have

00:30:37.555 --> 00:30:41.011
two firms looks somewhere
between monopoly and perfect

00:30:41.011 --> 00:30:43.611
competition.
So we'd like an outcome that

00:30:43.611 --> 00:30:46.913
looks a little bit like Cournot,
but we'd like the strategy set

00:30:46.913 --> 00:30:49.044
to be prices,
and this is going to do the

00:30:49.044 --> 00:30:50.734
trick.
This is going to turn out to do

00:30:50.734 --> 00:30:52.799
the trick as you'll find out in
your homework assignment.

00:30:52.799 --> 00:30:55.190
So how are we going to model
this on the homework?

00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:58.354
The way we're going to model
differentiated products is to

00:30:58.354 --> 00:31:00.630
imagine, just to take a simple
example,

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:05.385
imagine a city and this city
has one long straight road

00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:08.369
through it.
So this city is not a city in

00:31:08.369 --> 00:31:12.365
New England, it's a city in the
Midwest, where everything's flat

00:31:12.365 --> 00:31:15.220
and the roads just go completely
straight.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.049
You can think of this as being
a mile long.

00:31:17.049 --> 00:31:20.993
It doesn't really matter,
let's just think of it as being

00:31:20.993 --> 00:31:25.030
a mile long.
We're going to assume that

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:30.309
consumers are evenly spread
along this city.

00:31:30.309 --> 00:31:33.824
So there's basically consumers
everywhere, they're evenly

00:31:33.824 --> 00:31:37.839
distributed and we're going to
assume that one of these firms,

00:31:37.839 --> 00:31:47.020
let's call it Firm 1 sits at
point 0 and the other firm,

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:52.338
Firm 2, sits at point 1.
Now, this is what you're going

00:31:52.338 --> 00:31:54.000
to do in the homework
assignment, but I'm just going

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.989
to make the argument that you
could also imagine firms sitting

00:31:55.989 --> 00:31:58.806
somewhere between 0 and 1.
We could do a more general job

00:31:58.806 --> 00:32:00.492
if we wanted to,
but for now,

00:32:00.492 --> 00:32:04.226
let's assume that one of these
firms has its shop at one end of

00:32:04.226 --> 00:32:07.654
the town,
and the other one has its shop

00:32:07.654 --> 00:32:12.255
at the other end of the town.
So let's think about a

00:32:12.255 --> 00:32:16.561
particular consumer,
so suppose this consumer is

00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:22.759
here, at point Y say.
So notice that this consumer is

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:30.350
a distance Y away from Firm 1.
So if she consumes from Firm 1

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:36.921
she has to walk a distance of Y.
She's a distance of 1 -Y from

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:43.667
Firm 2, is that right?
So if she consumes from Firm 2

00:32:43.667 --> 00:32:48.774
she has to walk 1 -Y.
That's going to turn out to be

00:32:48.774 --> 00:32:51.190
key in our model as we'll see in
a second.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:59.119
So firms, as before,
are going to set prices.

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:01.236
I won't write everything down
because it's all written down on

00:33:01.236 --> 00:33:03.109
the homework assignment which is
already on the web,

00:33:03.109 --> 00:33:05.309
but in fact firms are going to
maximize profits,

00:33:05.309 --> 00:33:07.509
aim to maximize profits,
firms are going to have

00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:10.113
constant marginal costs.
We'll make one other assumption

00:33:10.113 --> 00:33:14.434
to keep life simple.
We'll assume that each consumer

00:33:14.434 --> 00:33:20.113
buys one and only one product.
Each consumer is going to buy

00:33:20.113 --> 00:33:23.809
one product, either from Firm 1
or from Firm 2.

00:33:23.809 --> 00:33:28.898
So the issue is going to be
which firm does each consumer go

00:33:28.898 --> 00:33:33.187
and buy their product from.
Which firm does each consumer

00:33:33.187 --> 00:33:40.786
choose?
We'll assume that each consumer

00:33:40.786 --> 00:33:52.478
chooses the product whose,
and I'll be careful here,

00:33:52.478 --> 00:34:01.190
whose total cost to her is
smaller.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.700
What do we mean by total cost?
Well let's look at the consumer

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.379
at point Y.
For example,

00:34:09.379 --> 00:34:21.651
for the consumer at point Y,
if they buy from Firm 1 then

00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:28.782
they pay the price P1,
which is set by Firm 1,

00:34:28.782 --> 00:34:31.799
but they also have to pay a
transport cost,

00:34:31.799 --> 00:34:36.109
the cost to them of having to
walk all the way there and walk

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:39.568
all the way back.
We'll give a name to that

00:34:39.568 --> 00:34:46.110
transport cost.
We'll say it's TY².

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:51.843
So Y is the distance they have
to travel and TY²

00:34:51.843 --> 00:34:59.127
is their transport cost.
So this object here we could

00:34:59.127 --> 00:35:08.018
think of as a transport cost.
If the same consumer buys from

00:35:08.018 --> 00:35:15.920
Firm 2 she pays P2 + T times
again the distance squared,

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:22.541
so that's going to be (1
–Y)²

00:35:22.541 --> 00:35:31.369
and once again this last term
is a transport cost.

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:34.309
Notice that these transport
costs go up in the distance you

00:35:34.309 --> 00:35:36.540
have to travel and they go up
pretty fast.

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:42.998
They go up at rates squared.
So what you're going to do on

00:35:42.998 --> 00:35:45.219
the homework assignment is solve
out this market.

00:35:45.219 --> 00:35:48.198
You're going to assume that
firms set prices to maximize

00:35:48.198 --> 00:35:49.867
profits.
You're going to know what

00:35:49.867 --> 00:35:52.365
firm's costs are.
You're going to work out what

00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:55.854
firm's demands are going to look
for each possible price they

00:35:55.854 --> 00:35:58.182
could set.
And you're going to solve out

00:35:58.182 --> 00:36:01.313
the whole Nash Equilibrium.
And then we're going to look at

00:36:01.313 --> 00:36:03.759
that Nash Equilibrium and you're
going to think,

00:36:03.759 --> 00:36:06.725
how does that compare to what I
saw in the Cournot case we

00:36:06.725 --> 00:36:12.633
solved.
So that's on the homework

00:36:12.633 --> 00:36:16.432
assignment.
But before I leave this,

00:36:16.432 --> 00:36:19.537
let me just point out that this
is a little bit more general

00:36:19.537 --> 00:36:23.720
than it might appear.
So here I've treated what makes

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:29.090
products different as being
where the shops are located.

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:32.696
So here I've interpreted these
terms here as transport costs,

00:36:32.696 --> 00:36:36.302
and I've interpreted what makes
the products different is the

00:36:36.302 --> 00:36:40.329
fact that one of them is selling
at one of the end of the town,

00:36:40.329 --> 00:36:45.449
and the other one is selling at
the whitehead end of town.

00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:49.131
But actually,
we could consider this model

00:36:49.131 --> 00:36:52.991
more generally,
and let's just do so briefly

00:36:52.991 --> 00:36:55.560
here.
So let me just redraw the town;

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:01.729
here's my town again.
I don't have to regard this

00:37:01.729 --> 00:37:06.139
product, this line as being
distance along the high street

00:37:06.139 --> 00:37:08.594
of the town.
It could be something else

00:37:08.594 --> 00:37:10.401
about the product.
So, for example,

00:37:10.401 --> 00:37:13.308
in whatever it is you guys
imagine makes Coke and Pepsi

00:37:13.308 --> 00:37:15.300
different, it could be that
thing.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.429
Don't quite know what that is,
but whatever that is.

00:37:17.429 --> 00:37:19.392
Let me take an example that I
understand better than I

00:37:19.392 --> 00:37:23.989
understand Coke and Pepsi.
So imagine we're talking about

00:37:23.989 --> 00:37:30.159
beer, think about beer,
so this is the beer market.

00:37:30.159 --> 00:37:34.060
This distance here could be
something like the alcohol

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:36.710
content or the flavor of the
beer.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:38.765
You can imagine different
products therefore,

00:37:38.765 --> 00:37:40.914
that are on the market,
positioning themselves,

00:37:40.914 --> 00:37:43.530
or being positioned at
different points on the line.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.180
So, for example,
up here if you want beer flavor

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:50.907
this might be Guinness,
which I can't even spell,

00:37:50.907 --> 00:37:54.452
but you know what I mean.
If we think about the drinks

00:37:54.452 --> 00:37:56.900
industry more generally here,
rather than just beer,

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.398
this would be Guinness,
this would be Poland Spring,

00:38:01.398 --> 00:38:06.780
this is water and everything
else would be in between here.

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:12.602
So if we just go a tiny
distance in here,

00:38:12.602 --> 00:38:18.515
this is Bud Light and so on.
You could put everything on

00:38:18.515 --> 00:38:21.950
this line, I think there may be,
I'm not really allowed to do

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:25.042
this on this model,
the one thing I can't do is,

00:38:25.042 --> 00:38:28.510
part of the truth is that Bud
Light might be down here

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:31.389
somewhere but I'm not allowed to
do that.

00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:34.252
So leaving aside the specific
example of beer,

00:38:34.252 --> 00:38:38.069
you think about some product
that has some dimension on which

00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:41.130
it varies,
and we can use this model to

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:45.239
see how competition is going to
work in that market.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:49.123
But now notice that this
transport cost is going to be a

00:38:49.123 --> 00:38:52.658
different interpretation.
Now, instead of being the cost

00:38:52.658 --> 00:38:55.482
of traveling that distance to go
and buy the product,

00:38:55.482 --> 00:38:58.872
what's it going to be?
It's going to be that if my

00:38:58.872 --> 00:39:02.260
preferred beer flavor is here
say, this is me,

00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.969
my preferred beer flavor is
here,

00:39:04.969 --> 00:39:07.698
then if I end up having to
consume Guinness,

00:39:07.698 --> 00:39:11.252
I have to pay the price of
Guinness and I also incur some

00:39:11.252 --> 00:39:14.870
costs because Guinness isn't the
perfect beer for me,

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:19.243
it's a little bit too strong.
If I consume Bud Light,

00:39:19.243 --> 00:39:22.869
then I have to pay for the Bud
Light, I think it typically

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:25.448
costs less,
the price, the raw price is

00:39:25.448 --> 00:39:29.201
less than Guinness but I also
pay an additional cost from the

00:39:29.201 --> 00:39:32.136
fact that Bud Light,
when I drink it,

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:36.721
causes me "disutility":
we'll put it politely like

00:39:36.721 --> 00:39:38.484
that.
So basically,

00:39:38.484 --> 00:39:42.854
that transport cost is now the
lack of pleasure caused by

00:39:42.854 --> 00:39:46.599
drinking a product that isn't
perfect for me.

00:39:46.599 --> 00:39:49.610
Does everyone understand the
story here?

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.923
So you're going to figure out
what happens in this story very

00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:53.349
generally, well not very
generally,

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:55.896
but in the particular case
actually on the homework

00:39:55.896 --> 00:39:58.799
assignment, but I want you to
understand that there's this

00:39:58.799 --> 00:40:01.039
much more general story
underlying this,

00:40:01.039 --> 00:40:05.480
and this is a pretty good model
of a lot of markets.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:11.770
It's the kind of model that
you'd see again if you went onto

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.572
graduate school.
Now I want to spend the rest of

00:40:15.572 --> 00:40:17.940
today doing something quite
different.

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:21.099
But you'll see it isn't all
that different.

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:23.838
I'm going to go away from
studying imperfect competition

00:40:23.838 --> 00:40:26.925
and go back and visit something
we studied almost the first day

00:40:26.925 --> 00:40:30.409
or maybe the second day,
and that's elections.

00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:33.237
I want to go back to elections
and why do I want to go back at

00:40:33.237 --> 00:40:35.326
this point?
Well one reason I want to go

00:40:35.326 --> 00:40:38.513
back is you'll notice I've been
putting up these lines on the

00:40:38.513 --> 00:40:41.539
board and when we visited
elections on the second day,

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:46.689
we said that you could think of
that line on the board,

00:40:46.689 --> 00:40:51.385
as being not just left wing,
right wing politics but also

00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:55.188
some dimension of products.
So I want to go back again,

00:40:55.188 --> 00:40:59.636
now we're considering the line
on the board as being flavor in

00:40:59.636 --> 00:41:01.423
beer,
or location in a town,

00:41:01.423 --> 00:41:04.430
and I want to go back to
politics now and go back to the

00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:08.189
interpretation we started with,
so that left and right will end

00:41:08.189 --> 00:41:11.619
up being left-wing politics
versus right-wing politics.

00:41:11.619 --> 00:41:16.693
So I'm going to take the same
basic idea back to the politics

00:41:16.693 --> 00:41:18.868
model.
We'll spend the rest of today

00:41:18.868 --> 00:41:21.946
in politics.
So we're going to be doing

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:27.591
Political Science or Political
Science as it meets Game Theory

00:41:27.591 --> 00:41:36.305
for the rest of the day.
We're going to study something

00:41:36.305 --> 00:41:43.349
called The Candidate-Voter
Model.

00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:47.612
This model is going to look a
lot like the models we looked at

00:41:47.612 --> 00:41:50.343
already a few weeks ago.
In particular,

00:41:50.343 --> 00:41:53.148
as advertised,
there will be a line and this

00:41:53.148 --> 00:41:57.323
line will go from 0 to 1 and the
left hand side of this line will

00:41:57.323 --> 00:42:01.432
represent the left wing and the
right hand side of the line will

00:42:01.432 --> 00:42:05.889
represent the right wing,
so that's the same as before.

00:42:05.889 --> 00:42:09.065
As before, as in the Downs or
Hoteling model,

00:42:09.065 --> 00:42:11.880
we discussed already a few
weeks ago,

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.535
we're going to assume that
voters are evenly spread along

00:42:16.535 --> 00:42:23.089
the line.
So we're going to assume even

00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:30.090
distribution of voters on the
line.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:39.223
We're also going to assume,
just as we did last time,

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:49.409
that voters are going to vote
for the closest candidate.

00:42:49.409 --> 00:42:53.074
So all of these assumptions are
the same assumptions we studied

00:42:53.074 --> 00:42:55.142
two weeks ago,
or two and a half weeks ago,

00:42:55.142 --> 00:42:57.228
and which you actually studied
in your first homework

00:42:57.228 --> 00:42:59.460
assignment.
Is that right?

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.999
But I want to go back there
because what I want to do now

00:43:02.999 --> 00:43:06.349
is, I want to change some
critical assumptions of that

00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:09.320
model and see that by making
those changes,

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.610
we're going to get some very
different outcomes.

00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:20.036
So, in particular,
the new things here,

00:43:20.036 --> 00:43:30.980
two things, one the number of
candidates is not fixed.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:37.393
So the number of candidates in
this model is going to be

00:43:37.393 --> 00:43:40.374
endogenous.
Previously, we looked at models

00:43:40.374 --> 00:43:43.304
where there were two candidates
or on your homework assignment,

00:43:43.304 --> 00:43:46.310
three candidates.
Now we're going to allow the

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:49.179
number of candidates to adjust
itself.

00:43:49.179 --> 00:43:53.444
The second assumption we're
going to make which is new is

00:43:53.444 --> 00:43:58.090
that we're going to assume that
candidates cannot choose their

00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:59.914
position.
So the idea is,

00:43:59.914 --> 00:44:02.197
any candidate who stands in
this election,

00:44:02.197 --> 00:44:06.218
you know who that candidate is,
you know whether they're right

00:44:06.218 --> 00:44:09.623
wing or left wing,
so they can't tell you they're

00:44:09.623 --> 00:44:20.224
something else.
So candidates cannot choose

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:27.203
their position.
So this is a subtle thing

00:44:27.203 --> 00:44:29.761
because you think about the
current election,

00:44:29.761 --> 00:44:32.610
there's a debate about whether
Hilary Clinton,

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:35.077
for example,
can choose right now to be at

00:44:35.077 --> 00:44:38.628
the center of the democratic
party given her past history of

00:44:38.628 --> 00:44:41.110
votes,
for example, on the Iraq War.

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:44.051
Or on the other side,
there's a debate about whether

00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:47.146
Mitt Romney can choose to be,
I guess he's trying to choose

00:44:47.146 --> 00:44:49.849
himself to be on the right hand
wing of the republic party,

00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:52.839
given he has a record of
governance, as being Governor of

00:44:52.839 --> 00:44:56.150
Massachusetts when he provided
state healthcare for example.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.434
So it's quite difficult in the
real world for candidates to

00:44:59.434 --> 00:45:02.317
position themselves.
Voters tend to know that those

00:45:02.317 --> 00:45:05.039
candidates have track records.
That's something we've

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:07.285
mentioned already three weeks
ago, two weeks ago,

00:45:07.285 --> 00:45:08.969
we're going to take that fix
now,

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:14.059
we're going to assume you know
who these candidates are.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:17.750
So what are we actually going
to assume?

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.553
We're going to assume that each
voter in the model is a

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:25.590
potential candidate.
So this is, I think,

00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:28.130
a nice idealized version of
American politics.

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:30.389
Each of you,
who is above 18 and is an

00:45:30.389 --> 00:45:33.259
American citizen,
and was born in America (maybe

00:45:33.259 --> 00:45:35.579
you have to be more than above
18,

00:45:35.579 --> 00:45:36.983
above whatever it is,
whatever the rule is,

00:45:36.983 --> 00:45:38.119
whatever the Constitution
says),

00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:41.724
each of you can potentially
stand up now and say you're

00:45:41.724 --> 00:45:44.804
going to run for President.
I'm guessing all of you are

00:45:44.804 --> 00:45:46.736
ruled out by age actually.
There's some rule in the

00:45:46.736 --> 00:45:47.655
Constitution,
but never mind,

00:45:47.655 --> 00:45:57.253
let's pretend that's not there.
So the idea of the model is

00:45:57.253 --> 00:46:08.880
each voter is a potential
candidate.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:15.066
That's a very appealing
assumption I think in a

00:46:15.066 --> 00:46:17.634
democracy.
So what I want to do is,

00:46:17.634 --> 00:46:20.059
I want to lay this out a little
bit more formally as a game,

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:24.585
and then, since we haven't done
anything like this for a week or

00:46:24.585 --> 00:46:27.099
so, we're going to play the
game.

00:46:27.099 --> 00:46:30.449
So you're about to play this
game, so pay attention please.

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:35.280
So who are the voters,
who are the players?

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:41.502
The players are the voters.
The voters, or candidates,

00:46:41.502 --> 00:46:47.232
whatever you want to call them,
depending on where they stand,

00:46:47.232 --> 00:46:50.989
in this game they're going to
be you.

00:46:50.989 --> 00:46:54.080
The key strategy here,
essentially the strategy is

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:57.493
going to be very simple.
The strategy is:

00:46:57.493 --> 00:47:00.672
do you run or not?
The reason that's going to be

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:02.780
the strategy is that voting's
not going to be difficult.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.148
You're always going to end up
voting for the candidate who's

00:47:06.148 --> 00:47:10.819
closest.
So the only really relevant

00:47:10.819 --> 00:47:19.929
strategy is to run or not to
run, to stand or not to stand.

00:47:19.929 --> 00:47:31.776
So just to make that clear,
voters vote for the closest

00:47:31.776 --> 00:47:39.529
running candidate first.
And second, what did it mean to

00:47:39.529 --> 00:47:42.054
win?
Well assume that we're in a

00:47:42.054 --> 00:47:46.524
plurality election here,
so the winner is the person who

00:47:46.524 --> 00:47:52.799
gets a plurality.
You win if you get the most

00:47:52.799 --> 00:47:59.196
votes, in other words.
We'll assume that if there's a

00:47:59.196 --> 00:48:03.501
tie that we flip a fair coin or
a Supreme Court judge,

00:48:03.501 --> 00:48:06.750
whatever you want to take,
whichever.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:19.204
Flip if tie.
The payoffs in this game are as

00:48:19.204 --> 00:48:24.602
follows.
We'll assume that there's a

00:48:24.602 --> 00:48:30.966
prize for winning.
So if you win the election you

00:48:30.966 --> 00:48:36.573
get a prize equal to B.
We'll also assume that there's

00:48:36.573 --> 00:48:41.030
a cost of running,
so if you enter this election,

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:49.750
win or not, you incur a cost of
C, and we'll assume that B is

00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:56.667
greater than or equal to 2C,
and actually for today,

00:48:56.667 --> 00:49:03.339
let's just keep things simple,
and assume it's actually equal

00:49:03.339 --> 00:49:05.446
to 2C.
But that's not the only part of

00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:07.440
the payoffs.
There's also a part of the

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.914
payoffs that's analogous to
forcing me to drink Bud Light or

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:13.800
forcing the Pepsi drinkers to
drink Coca-Cola.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.712
What's that?
That's if, regardless of

00:49:16.712 --> 00:49:20.829
whether I run or not,
if some other candidate is

00:49:20.829 --> 00:49:25.385
elected other than me,
then they're not going to have

00:49:25.385 --> 00:49:29.147
my ideal policies.
So it's going to cause me

00:49:29.147 --> 00:49:33.622
unhappiness, it's going to cause
me disutility having a candidate

00:49:33.622 --> 00:49:40.645
win, who's far away from me.
So there's going to be an extra

00:49:40.645 --> 00:49:50.198
thing and, so if you're position
is X, if you are at X on that

00:49:50.198 --> 00:49:57.559
line and the winner of the
election is at Y,

00:49:57.559 --> 00:50:01.315
than you pay a cost of
–|X –Y|,

00:50:01.315 --> 00:50:06.860
the absolute distance between
you and the winning candidate.

00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:11.031
So again, if you're at X and
the winner is at Y,

00:50:11.031 --> 00:50:15.469
it hurts you minus the distance
between X and Y,

00:50:15.469 --> 00:50:18.762
in terms of your unhappiness,
about having a winner who's far

00:50:18.762 --> 00:50:21.449
away from you,
winning.

00:50:21.449 --> 00:50:36.777
So let's do an example,
just want to make sure we

00:50:36.777 --> 00:50:45.886
understand the payoffs.
So Example 1,

00:50:45.886 --> 00:50:49.179
if you're at X,
let's just call you Mr.

00:50:49.179 --> 00:50:51.866
X, just to make it clear,
so Mr.

00:50:51.866 --> 00:50:58.691
X is the person at position X.
If he enters the election and

00:50:58.691 --> 00:51:06.405
he wins the election then his
payoff is B because he entered

00:51:06.405 --> 00:51:09.203
-C,
--sorry B because he won,

00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:12.989
-C because he had to pay his
election expense.

00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:17.093
But the winning candidate is
him so he gets no disutility

00:51:17.093 --> 00:51:20.610
from the winning candidate being
someone else.

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:25.195
Second possibility,
if Mr.

00:51:25.195 --> 00:51:32.899
X enters but Mr.
Y wins, then X's payoff is

00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:38.717
what?
He still incurred -C because he

00:51:38.717 --> 00:51:46.514
ran and he also has a cost of
|X-Y| because he doesn't like

00:51:46.514 --> 00:51:48.800
Mr.
Y winning.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:54.774
Third, if Mr.
X stays out but Mr.

00:51:54.774 --> 00:52:02.989
Y wins then Mr.
X's payoff, he doesn't win so

00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:09.843
he doesn't get B,
he doesn't lose C because he

00:52:09.843 --> 00:52:15.814
didn't run, but he still has
this disutility -|X –Y|

00:52:15.814 --> 00:52:19.690
because he doesn't like Y
winning.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:23.460
Does everyone understand this
game?

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:29.233
Everyone understand the game?
Anyone not understand the game

00:52:29.233 --> 00:52:31.248
at this point?
In principle,

00:52:31.248 --> 00:52:34.948
we could play this with the
whole class, but let's single

00:52:34.948 --> 00:52:38.779
out a particular row of the
class so I'm going to come down

00:52:38.779 --> 00:52:43.110
here and I guess eventually,
well I'll grab it in a minute.

00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:50.969
So I'm going to use this row,
I think, everyone in this row

00:52:50.969 --> 00:52:56.389
stand up a second,
and this row stand up,

00:52:56.389 --> 00:53:01.810
this is the row of potential
voters.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:04.731
They're the voters.
They're also the potential

00:53:04.731 --> 00:53:07.193
candidates.
So we need to have a convention

00:53:07.193 --> 00:53:10.279
here, whether we're viewing this
from the perspective of people

00:53:10.279 --> 00:53:12.369
behind them or people in front
of them,

00:53:12.369 --> 00:53:13.710
let's view it from the
perspective of the people in

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:15.143
front of them.
So I got an R,

00:53:15.143 --> 00:53:17.510
I'll do it the other way
around.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:19.409
People from behind that have
the perspective.

00:53:19.409 --> 00:53:24.809
So this gentleman here who's
name is Andy.

00:53:24.809 --> 00:53:31.453
So Andy is our crazy right-wing
guy and Sudipta is our crazy

00:53:31.453 --> 00:53:36.519
left-wing guy,
everyone else is in between.

00:53:36.519 --> 00:53:39.407
There's 1,2,
3,4, 5,6, 7,8,

00:53:39.407 --> 00:53:43.849
9,10, 11,12,
13,14, 15,16 people here.

00:53:43.849 --> 00:53:48.263
Let me add, let me make it 17
people so we have an odd number,

00:53:48.263 --> 00:53:52.655
so go and sit in that row.
Okay, now we have 17 people

00:53:52.655 --> 00:53:56.750
it's a bit easier.
Just want to avoid obvious ties.

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.867
So how is this going to work?
Everybody sit down again but

00:53:58.867 --> 00:54:01.606
don't put your--keep your books
handy because this is going to

00:54:01.606 --> 00:54:04.518
be pretty aerobic.
So these are the potential

00:54:04.518 --> 00:54:09.062
voters and each of them is in
the position that Fred Thompson

00:54:09.062 --> 00:54:11.982
was in,
two weeks ago in the Republican

00:54:11.982 --> 00:54:15.539
Primary, when he's deciding
whether to run or not.

00:54:15.539 --> 00:54:18.254
But in the real world that's a
sequential game,

00:54:18.254 --> 00:54:21.558
people decide to run in some
order, we're going to assume

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:25.159
this is all simultaneous.
So what we're going to do is

00:54:25.159 --> 00:54:28.059
we're going to hold essentially
this game.

00:54:28.059 --> 00:54:30.715
We're going to ask everybody in
this row whether they want to

00:54:30.715 --> 00:54:32.909
enter or not.
Let's make some real numbers.

00:54:32.909 --> 00:54:38.472
Let's assume that B is equal to
$2, so the spoils of government

00:54:38.472 --> 00:54:42.690
are $2 and entering costs you
$1, so C is $1.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:46.798
And we'll assume that the
amount of disutility you get

00:54:46.798 --> 00:54:50.752
from being far away from the
winner is 1/17th of the

00:54:50.752 --> 00:54:52.804
distance,
each of these,

00:54:52.804 --> 00:54:55.490
each place is worth 1/17th of a
$1.

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:58.655
Everyone understand?
So whatever 1/17th of a $1,

00:54:58.655 --> 00:55:02.239
roughly $.05 for each position
away.

00:55:02.239 --> 00:55:04.960
Everyone understand in this row
what we're doing?

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.151
I'm not getting any nods,
you guys over here you

00:55:07.151 --> 00:55:10.594
understand what we're doing?
So on the count of three,

00:55:10.594 --> 00:55:15.420
anybody who's entering this
election is going to stand up.

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:25.769
Ready?
One, two, okay what?

00:55:25.769 --> 00:55:27.741
That's the opposite of what's
happening with the Florida

00:55:27.741 --> 00:55:29.510
Primary.
Yeah question?

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:32.163
Student: I'm sorry,
who stands up on the count of

00:55:32.163 --> 00:55:33.342
three?
Professor Ben Polak: You

00:55:33.342 --> 00:55:34.340
guys have to decide whether you,
okay.

00:55:34.340 --> 00:55:36.850
So if you're going to,
if you're running you stand up.

00:55:36.850 --> 00:55:48.139
If you're standing you stand.
Let's try again one, two, three.

00:55:48.139 --> 00:55:53.360
Stay standing and I'll come
around a second.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.403
So here's our election,
and it's between a,

00:55:56.403 --> 00:55:59.492
which way do I want to do it?
This is our left wing

00:55:59.492 --> 00:56:01.939
candidate, this is our moderate
left wing candidate whose name

00:56:01.939 --> 00:56:04.010
is?
Student: Alex.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:05.590
Professor Ben Polak: Our
kind of centrist candidate,

00:56:05.590 --> 00:56:06.980
maybe even this centrist
candidate who's name is?

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.961
Student: Beatrice.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:11.816
Beatrice.
So this is the election,

00:56:11.816 --> 00:56:15.139
who's going to win this
election?

00:56:15.139 --> 00:56:16.430
Beatrice is going to win this
election.

00:56:16.430 --> 00:56:22.857
Let's just check that.
Beatrice is going to get all of

00:56:22.857 --> 00:56:29.280
these right wing votes.
Beatrice is also going to get

00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:34.281
one and a half of the votes in
the middle, so this vote and

00:56:34.281 --> 00:56:38.211
half the Pierson guy's vote and,
I've forgotten your name

00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:39.831
already, again?
Alex is going to get all the

00:56:39.831 --> 00:56:41.420
left wing votes,
but there aren't enough left

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.360
wing votes here,
right?

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:47.867
So Beatrice is going to win.
So Beatrice won this election,

00:56:47.867 --> 00:56:51.220
is this array a Nash
Equilibrium?

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:55.130
Is this an equilibrium?
How do we know it's not an

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.043
equilibrium?
Katie, how do we know this is

00:56:58.043 --> 00:57:01.105
not an equilibrium?
Student: Because Alex's

00:57:01.105 --> 00:57:03.679
best response to her running is
to not run.

00:57:03.679 --> 00:57:04.289
Professor Ben Polak:
Absolutely.

00:57:04.289 --> 00:57:06.852
So Alex here,
Alex ends up with a payoff of

00:57:06.852 --> 00:57:09.346
what?
Alex ended up with a payoff of

00:57:09.346 --> 00:57:13.272
-C, actually more than that,
-C minus the distance between

00:57:13.272 --> 00:57:15.769
him and Beatrice,
so that's another $1,

00:57:15.769 --> 00:57:17.796
$.05, $.10 or even $.20
whatever it is,

00:57:17.796 --> 00:57:20.409
and he would have done better
to have not run.

00:57:20.409 --> 00:57:22.439
If he hadn't run,
Beatrice would still have won,

00:57:22.439 --> 00:57:24.943
but it would still have cost
him the $.20 of unhappiness at

00:57:24.943 --> 00:57:27.060
Beatrice winning,
but at least he would have

00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:29.050
saved himself the C of running.
Everyone see that?

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.603
Let's try it again.
Okay, same row,

00:57:31.603 --> 00:57:35.210
but don't hesitate so much this
time.

00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:36.929
Count of three,
you're just going to go or not.

00:57:36.929 --> 00:57:39.461
Everybody in this row close
their eyes so you can't look

00:57:39.461 --> 00:57:41.418
around you.
Close your eyes,

00:57:41.418 --> 00:57:46.090
you can do all sorts of nasty
things, close your eyes.

00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.270
Myrto you're still in this row
okay.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:58:00.691
So one, two, three.
You can open your eyes again,

00:58:00.691 --> 00:58:04.159
so now what happened,
we ended up with two centrist

00:58:04.159 --> 00:58:06.086
candidates.
Let's see what happened,

00:58:06.086 --> 00:58:08.120
so we have Beatrice and your
name is Claire Elise.

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.085
Student: Claire Elise.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:58:11.085 --> 00:58:12.539
Claire Elise is going to get her
own vote plus 1,

00:58:12.539 --> 00:58:16.661
2,3, 4,5, 6,7,
8,8 votes and Beatrice is

00:58:16.661 --> 00:58:21.523
getting 1,2, 3,4,
5,6, 7, how did I end up with

00:58:21.523 --> 00:58:23.429
eight,
I thought I had an odd number.

00:58:23.429 --> 00:58:26.243
1,2, 3,4, 5,6,
7 there must have been an odd

00:58:26.243 --> 00:58:29.309
number before.
So Claire Elise is going to win

00:58:29.309 --> 00:58:32.239
this election because she got
one more vote.

00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:35.340
Now here we ended up with two
centrist candidates,

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.137
which is a result pretty close
to what we saw in the Hoteling

00:58:39.137 --> 00:58:42.800
model, is that right?
Is this an equilibrium?

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:48.377
So check that I counted right,
1,2, 3,4, 5,6,

00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:51.800
7,8 and 1,2,
3,4, 5,6, 7.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:54.025
I guess I did count right,
so Claire Elise turned out to

00:58:54.025 --> 00:58:55.360
win this.
I counted that correctly.

00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:59.251
There's another vote hidden
behind there,

00:58:59.251 --> 00:59:02.020
I didn't see you.
Let's try again.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.680
So 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7,8.
I apologize Beatrice won this

00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:09.940
election, I apologize.
Beatrice won this election.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:18.008
Is this an equilibrium?
How do we know this isn't an

00:59:18.008 --> 00:59:20.897
equilibrium?
Because Claire Elise would

00:59:20.897 --> 00:59:22.679
rather not have run,
is that right?

00:59:22.679 --> 00:59:26.502
Let's try once more,
down again, close your eyes

00:59:26.502 --> 00:59:30.732
again, just to keep life
interesting, let's switch to

00:59:30.732 --> 00:59:33.730
this row.
Can we switch to this row okay?

00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:36.590
So this is our row now,
everyone understand this.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.351
Close your computer so you can
get up without destroying

00:59:39.351 --> 00:59:41.210
thousands of dollars of
technology.

00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:45.156
This is our row and at the
count of three we're going to

00:59:45.156 --> 00:59:49.870
see who's going to run.
Everyone understand the game?

00:59:49.870 --> 01:00:08.179
Close your eyes, 1,2,3.
It's obvious he's going to win

01:00:08.179 --> 01:00:10.219
this election,
is that right?

01:00:10.219 --> 01:00:17.950
Just to ask the question,
is this an equilibrium?

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:20.305
Let's count.
1,2, 3,4, 5,6,

01:00:20.305 --> 01:00:26.396
7,8, 9 he's going to get 10
votes, including himself there

01:00:26.396 --> 01:00:29.996
are 10 votes here.
I can't count correctly,

01:00:29.996 --> 01:00:32.427
1,2, 3,4, 5,6,
is he actually the center guy

01:00:32.427 --> 01:00:34.500
here?
I don't think he is the center

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.947
guy here.
So I claim, if I've counted

01:00:36.947 --> 01:00:40.619
correctly, that this actually
isn't an equilibrium.

01:00:40.619 --> 01:00:44.480
Who can deviate and do better
here?

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.340
This guy, stand up a second,
whose name is?

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.382
Student: John.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:00:49.382 --> 01:00:51.062
Had John entered,
if I've counted correctly,

01:00:51.062 --> 01:00:53.792
let's pretend I have,
John would actually have won

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:57.940
this election because John is
actually further to the center.

01:00:57.940 --> 01:01:00.849
Okay, so let's,
thanks for a second guys,

01:01:00.849 --> 01:01:03.539
I'll come back to this in a
second.

01:01:03.539 --> 01:01:07.500
Let's try and figure out how to
analyze this game.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.908
We've played it three times,
let's try and figure out what

01:01:10.908 --> 01:01:13.420
the equilibria looked like in
this game.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.631
This game that's going on more
or less right now in the

01:01:16.631 --> 01:01:20.199
primaries, well I guess the
entry stage of it is gone now.

01:01:20.199 --> 01:01:25.378
So first of all,
is there a Nash Equilibrium in

01:01:25.378 --> 01:01:31.153
which no candidates stand?
Is there a Nash Equilibrium in

01:01:31.153 --> 01:01:33.389
which nobody stands?
No.

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.880
How do we know that's not a
Nash Equilibrium?

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.296
Somebody?
Yeah, how do we know that's not

01:01:38.296 --> 01:01:40.280
a Nash Equilibrium?
Shout it out.

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.404
Student: Because then
somebody's definitely better off

01:01:43.404 --> 01:01:45.337
by standing up.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:01:45.337 --> 01:01:47.160
Right, if nobody stands,
each and every possible

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.789
candidate would do better
individually,

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:52.760
so any particular voter would
do better standing.

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.010
They would win the election.
Is that right?

01:01:56.010 --> 01:01:59.400
So clearly it's not an
equilibrium for nobody to stand.

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:02.019
That's good because we don't
see that very often.

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:12.690
Is there a Nash Equilibrium in
which one and only one candidate

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:15.175
stands?
Student: If they're

01:02:15.175 --> 01:02:17.462
directly in the center.
Professor Ben Polak: All

01:02:17.462 --> 01:02:20.489
right, so given that we chose an
odd number of people in the row,

01:02:20.489 --> 01:02:25.630
if exactly one candidate stands
and that candidate is the center

01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:28.809
candidate,
then that's an equilibrium.

01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:31.340
How do we know that's an
equilibrium?

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:33.269
Somebody give me the argument
why that's an equilibrium?

01:02:33.269 --> 01:02:36.739
It's a good,
in fact, it's a correct guess.

01:02:36.739 --> 01:02:37.970
But how do we know that's an
equilibrium?

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:42.099
That's the guess part.
How do we check that's an

01:02:42.099 --> 01:02:45.903
equilibrium?
Student: If anybody on

01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:49.849
either side of them chose to
run, they would lose.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:50.636
Professor Ben Polak:
They would lose,

01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:52.811
exactly.
So if anybody on either side of

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:55.510
them runs, that person would
simply lose.

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:57.909
It wouldn't make any difference
to the outcome.

01:02:57.909 --> 01:03:00.469
If a person on the right stood,
so let's just try it again.

01:03:00.469 --> 01:03:05.429
So we figured out that,
Beatrice stand up a second.

01:03:05.429 --> 01:03:08.634
So here's our potential
equilibrium with just Beatrice

01:03:08.634 --> 01:03:10.750
standing, and if somebody to
the,

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.986
which way do we do it,
somebody to the right of

01:03:12.986 --> 01:03:15.710
Beatrice was to stand,
so ma'am if you stand a second,

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:16.809
and your name is?
Student: Stacy.

01:03:16.809 --> 01:03:18.297
Professor Ben Polak: So
if Stacy stands,

01:03:18.297 --> 01:03:19.850
it doesn't make any difference
she just loses.

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:22.818
Beatrice wins anyway;
it just costs Beatrice some

01:03:22.818 --> 01:03:25.817
money.
Conversely, if Beatrice doesn't

01:03:25.817 --> 01:03:30.079
stand and the woman who's one in
from the side there,

01:03:30.079 --> 01:03:32.609
sit down a second Stacy and if
this person stands,

01:03:32.609 --> 01:03:34.392
and your name is?
If Sarah stands,

01:03:34.392 --> 01:03:36.700
it doesn't help Sarah at all,
she just loses.

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.007
Is that right?
So there is an equilibrium with

01:03:40.007 --> 01:03:43.429
exactly one candidate,
the center candidate.

01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:47.530
Now that's looking a little bit
like the median voter model.

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:51.796
It says there is an equilibrium
with only one candidate standing

01:03:51.796 --> 01:03:55.250
and that candidate would be the
median candidate,

01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:59.316
just like it was in the model
we saw on your homework

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:05.857
assignment and also in class.
However, we're not done yet,

01:04:05.857 --> 01:04:10.710
there could be other
equilibria.

01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:13.047
So let's just try and think
about whether there are other

01:04:13.047 --> 01:04:15.349
equilibria.
So, for example suppose now,

01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:18.429
just to make life a little bit
more interesting,

01:04:18.429 --> 01:04:22.350
suppose that the voters were
actually two rows and just allow

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:26.205
me the suspension of disbelief
that these rows have the same

01:04:26.205 --> 01:04:29.530
number of people in them,
I know they don't really.

01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:33.975
So now what I want you to think
of is that at every political

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:37.828
position there are two voters,
and hence two possible

01:04:37.828 --> 01:04:40.161
candidates.
There's two people at every

01:04:40.161 --> 01:04:42.106
position, these two people at
this position,

01:04:42.106 --> 01:04:43.780
these two people at this
position.

01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:46.505
Everyone understand that?
Let's just assume that the rows

01:04:46.505 --> 01:04:48.998
are the same even though they're
not and let's examine the

01:04:48.998 --> 01:04:52.236
following thing.
Suppose Beatrice stands again,

01:04:52.236 --> 01:04:55.765
sorry Beatrice,
and the gentleman in front of

01:04:55.765 --> 01:04:59.167
her whose name is?
Robert stands as well,

01:04:59.167 --> 01:05:03.426
so stand a second.
So now we have two candidates

01:05:03.426 --> 01:05:07.159
standing who are identical,
politically,

01:05:07.159 --> 01:05:10.978
they're identical.
They're right on top of each

01:05:10.978 --> 01:05:17.190
other.
Now is that an equilibrium?

01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:20.988
After all that looks a lot like
the Downs-Hoteling model,

01:05:20.988 --> 01:05:24.108
we've got two candidates
exactly at the middle,

01:05:24.108 --> 01:05:28.809
is that an equilibrium?
Let me try the guy up here?

01:05:28.809 --> 01:05:30.590
Student: No,
because if someone on either

01:05:30.590 --> 01:05:32.786
side of them were to stand up
that person on the side would

01:05:32.786 --> 01:05:34.814
win.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:05:34.814 --> 01:05:38.072
Good, this can't be an
equilibrium because look what

01:05:38.072 --> 01:05:40.820
happens if Claire Elise stands a
second.

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:45.739
Claire Elise is going to win
all of the right wing votes,

01:05:45.739 --> 01:05:50.834
ranging from crazy to moderate,
and these guys are going to

01:05:50.834 --> 01:05:56.145
split the left wing votes.
So the total sum of right wing

01:05:56.145 --> 01:06:01.139
votes is going to beat out half
of the left wing votes.

01:06:01.139 --> 01:06:03.827
So it can't be an equilibrium,
the exact prediction of the

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:06.515
Downs model, two guys right on
top of each other is not an

01:06:06.515 --> 01:06:11.090
equilibrium.
Sit down again guys.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:14.579
Let's go back to one row again
because it's easy to work with.

01:06:14.579 --> 01:06:16.969
Let's try a slightly different
pattern.

01:06:16.969 --> 01:06:20.899
So suppose, assuming I counted
right, suppose that the

01:06:20.899 --> 01:06:25.686
following candidates enter.
So Claire Elise enters and I'm

01:06:25.686 --> 01:06:30.606
sorry I don't know your name,
Jean enters so let's have a

01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:34.333
look at this array.
Assume I got it right and

01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:43.309
Beatrice is actually the center.
Now is that an equilibrium?

01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:45.969
Who thinks that is an
equilibrium?

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:48.050
Who thinks it's not an
equilibrium?

01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:51.580
Who's waiting to see how other
people vote?

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:55.959
Well let's check.
So there's three possible types

01:06:55.959 --> 01:06:58.340
of deviation here that we need
to check.

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.833
We need to check another
entrant from the outside,

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:05.256
left wing or right wing,
we need to check another

01:07:05.256 --> 01:07:08.368
entrant in the middle,
there is only one possible one

01:07:08.368 --> 01:07:10.969
there, and there's a third kind
of deviation we should check,

01:07:10.969 --> 01:07:13.800
what's the third type of
deviation?

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:17.671
One of these might choose not
to run, one of you might choose

01:07:17.671 --> 01:07:19.760
not to run.
Let's do them in turn.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.744
So suppose that we consider a
deviation in which,

01:07:22.744 --> 01:07:26.350
and again I've forgotten your
name in which Stacy stands as

01:07:26.350 --> 01:07:29.460
well.
Stacy, just stand a second.

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.380
So is this a profitable
deviation for Stacy?

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:35.892
No it's not.
Why isn't it a profitable

01:07:35.892 --> 01:07:38.379
deviation for Stacy?
So two reasons:

01:07:38.379 --> 01:07:42.984
one is that she loses,
she's not going to win this

01:07:42.984 --> 01:07:46.652
election by standing.
But there's a second reason why

01:07:46.652 --> 01:07:49.105
this is a really bad deviation.
Why is it, what's the second

01:07:49.105 --> 01:07:51.059
reason?
Yes sir.

01:07:51.059 --> 01:07:52.709
Student: The winner is
going to be farther away from

01:07:52.709 --> 01:07:54.383
her.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:07:54.383 --> 01:07:57.780
Good, so by standing not only
does she not win the election,

01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:01.869
but she actually causes the
election to be won for sure by

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:04.380
Jean who's further away from
her.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.834
So Stacy's going to pick up the
right wing votes,

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:10.347
she's going to split.
The crazy right wing votes

01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:12.702
she's going to pick up.
The moderate right wing votes

01:08:12.702 --> 01:08:16.095
she's going to split with Claire
Elise, and Jean's going to have

01:08:16.095 --> 01:08:18.815
all the left wing votes,
extreme and moderate,

01:08:18.815 --> 01:08:22.189
and so from Stacy's point of
view this is a double bad.

01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:25.364
She doesn't get to be
President, sorry and you end up

01:08:25.364 --> 01:08:28.540
with a left wing President,
which you didn't like.

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:31.403
Everyone see that?
So clearly, that's not,

01:08:31.403 --> 01:08:33.921
thank you, that's not a
profitable deviation and it's

01:08:33.921 --> 01:08:36.730
also not a profitable deviation
for people on the left.

01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.217
Hang on a second.
So I think it's probably

01:08:40.217 --> 01:08:43.560
obvious why it's not a good
strategy for Beatrice to enter

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.240
here.
If Beatrice enters she loses.

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:48.602
Everyone can see that?
The person in the middle if

01:08:48.602 --> 01:08:51.669
they enter here loses,
so they're not going to want to

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:54.343
enter.
So the other possible deviation

01:08:54.343 --> 01:08:57.747
we have to consider,
is a deviation of the form of

01:08:57.747 --> 01:09:02.284
one of these guys dropping out.
So let's consider it,

01:09:02.284 --> 01:09:08.903
so come back to Claire Elise.
Is Claire Elise doing better in

01:09:08.903 --> 01:09:12.833
or out?
Is Claire Elise doing better in

01:09:12.833 --> 01:09:16.581
this election or out?
Let's think it through a

01:09:16.581 --> 01:09:19.449
second, if she stays in what's
her payoff?

01:09:19.449 --> 01:09:23.930
She wins B with probability a
half.

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:28.399
She costs C for sure,
that's a wash because B,

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:32.472
the way we've worked things
out, B was $2,

01:09:32.472 --> 01:09:37.259
C was $1, so B/2-C is a wash.
In terms of the benefits

01:09:37.259 --> 01:09:40.718
of--the spoils of government
versus the cost of running,

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:44.430
it's a wash for Claire Elise,
whether she enters or not.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:49.250
But by entering she has a half
chance of winning the election.

01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:52.718
So one way to think about it
is, is the expected distance

01:09:52.718 --> 01:09:55.010
from her of the winning
candidates,

01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:58.336
is: with probability of a half
it's herself so that's nothing,

01:09:58.336 --> 01:10:01.032
no distance,
and with probability of a half

01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:04.064
it's two places away.
So in expectation it's one

01:10:04.064 --> 01:10:06.111
place away.
If she drops out,

01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:09.787
Jean wins for sure,
so the expected distance away

01:10:09.787 --> 01:10:13.539
from her of the winning
candidate is two away.

01:10:13.539 --> 01:10:15.888
Just to say it again,
so the cost and direct benefits

01:10:15.888 --> 01:10:17.470
of government are a wash for
her.

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:21.189
But by dropping out she insures
that somebody further away from

01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:24.652
her wins for sure.
That's bad so she's going to

01:10:24.652 --> 01:10:27.175
stay in.
The same argument goes the

01:10:27.175 --> 01:10:29.800
other way, so this is an
equilibrium.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.916
Now we're not done and of
course we're out of time,

01:10:31.916 --> 01:10:34.329
so what are we going to do when
we come back next week?

01:10:34.329 --> 01:10:37.060
Don't pack up yet,
what are we going to do?

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.358
We're going to come back to
this row and we're going to

01:10:39.358 --> 01:10:41.869
figure out not just this
equilibrium, but all equilibria.

01:10:41.869 --> 01:10:43.789
Before you go though,
let's just think about it a

01:10:43.789 --> 01:10:46.270
second, so you can think about
it and talk about it at home,

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:49.702
so what we just saw was an
election in which we saw two

01:10:49.702 --> 01:10:51.989
candidates, Jean and Claire
Elise,

01:10:51.989 --> 01:10:55.649
who both stood very close to
each other.

01:10:55.649 --> 01:10:59.994
But a different question
is--before you go:

01:10:59.994 --> 01:11:05.682
stand up my very left-wing guy,
Sudipta, way at the end,

01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:09.819
and stand up my very right-wing
guy.

01:11:09.819 --> 01:11:13.557
Here's a candidate--here's an
outcome with two entrants in it,

01:11:13.557 --> 01:11:17.050
an extreme right-wing guy and
an extreme left-wing guy.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:20.265
Is that an equilibrium?
Think about it until we come

01:11:20.265 --> 01:11:21.331
back on Monday.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.060
Today we had ordinarily
expected Paulo Zanoni,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.780
who is a senior partner of
Goldman Sachs,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.184
to be with us,
and it turns out we are a lower

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:23.048
priority than a new merger deal,
and we will have him a month

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:28.015
from today,
which gives us time to pull

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:36.538
together a bunch of important
details about the institutional

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:42.991
foundations of capitalism,
and I'm going to use the term

00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:46.090
"wealth maximizing
law" today.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.490
If you think about what courts
do,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.633
and what legislators,
at any level from New Haven to

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.640
the Congress of the United
States,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.954
they set rules which create
incentives and disincentives

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:08.629
that affect how people behave.
 

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:15.459
We're going to do four topics
today, but they're all ways of

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.890
talking about that.
 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.667
I'm going to start with the
Coase Theorem,

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:24.323
which is not in your reading
packet, and neither is it,

00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:26.560
strictly speaking,
a theorem.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.813
But it is a foundational set of
concepts that Hernando de Soto's

00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:38.650
book, which we are reading,
is built on.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.316
De Soto has,
in effect, taken the Coase

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:47.816
Theorem, which is sixty years
back, and it won Ron Coase a

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:51.580
Nobel Prize about thirty years
ago;

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.226
has taken the Coase Theorem and
applied it to reality in a very

00:01:57.226 --> 00:01:58.410
lively way.
 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.230
The theorem is a good thing to
have in the background.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.783
Second, and very briefly,
we're going to look at a law

00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:07.484
case,
which is actually in the

00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:09.330
syllabus for a little later in
term,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.081
but I'm going to bring it
forward because this is really a

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:16.750
good place to show its result.
 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.908
It's a case about whaling off
Cape Cod in the 1980s

00:02:19.908 --> 00:02:21.300
[correction: 1880s].
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.215
And what's important about it
is not the facts of the case,

00:02:25.215 --> 00:02:28.318
but the way the judge reasoned
his decision.

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:33.300
Third, we're going to do de
Soto in America,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.500
which was the assignment in
this book for today's class,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.491
and finally,
we're going to look at some of

00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:47.766
the finer grained distinctions
in the way you can structure a

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.620
business organization.
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.979
Coase Theorem.
 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:58.068
It's about this story,
this is a story we've all been

00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:00.060
through, right?
 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.580
About disputed ownership of
property.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:12.516
Now I've noticed a pattern
here, and let's see if I've got

00:03:12.516 --> 00:03:17.944
it right or not,
that you're always in that

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:22.620
third chair from the end of this
row,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.069
and I think all three of you
are always in this orientation,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.538
am I right?
 

00:03:28.538 --> 00:03:30.000
Student: 
&gt;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.580
Prof: Okay,
and how would it work out if,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.084
let's say Leslie here,
came a little early next

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:40.970
Wednesday and sat in one of
those three chairs?

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.690
Student:  That would be
horrible.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.590
Prof: It would be
horrible.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.710
Okay, now what would be
horrible about it?

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.250
You're all co-equally students
in the course;

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.788
the chairs, so far as I can
tell, are identical,

00:03:56.788 --> 00:03:58.569
except that this one is broken.
 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.908
What's up?
 

00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:06.106
Student:  Well I'd that
this is sort of acknowledged as

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:06.960
my seat.
 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.643
Prof: Okay,
it's acknowledged as your seat

00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:13.110
and the other two of you would
say something very like that?

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.569
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.689
Prof: You own this one?
 

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:18.779
Student:  Yes.
 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.300
Student:  Yes.
 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.620
Prof: Okay.
 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.209
What we have here is an
informal set of property rights.

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:34.321
There isn't a law of any kind
which refers to these rights,

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:40.083
but they are the folk way,
folk way norms of our

00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:41.800
classroom.
 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.394
Now if we press further,
let's take--do you live in your

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:47.230
college?
 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.639
Student:  Do I what?
 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:49.629
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:50.240
Rae:  In your college.
 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.949
Student:  In my college?
 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.050
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.910
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.430
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.310
Rae:  Do you live there?
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.019
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:56.997
Prof: Are there property
rights in and around your

00:04:56.997 --> 00:04:59.180
entryway, and in your suite,
and so on?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.709
Student:  Yes.
 

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:02.836
Prof: Are they ones
written down by the Dean's

00:05:02.836 --> 00:05:03.899
Office or by the Master?
 

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:05.720
Student:  I presume.
 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.660
Prof: Are they?
 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.420
Student:  I believe so.
 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.057
Prof: Well,
I mean, aren't there some that

00:05:11.057 --> 00:05:11.810
aren't written down?
 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.759
Student:  Among our
students perhaps.

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:21.269
Prof: Well can you--I'm
trying to draw you out on this.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:24.750
Student:  For example,
right here is a corner of the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.930
common room, and dedicated to
his desk and his chairs,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:28.649
studies.
 

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:31.209
Prof: Would you think of
sitting there?

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:32.110
Student:  No.
 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.430
Prof: Okay.
 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.432
Ray, how does it--does your
friend here have any rights or

00:05:38.432 --> 00:05:38.750
not?
 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.964
Student:  I guess I
would say no,

00:05:41.964 --> 00:05:43.779
not where you go in.
 

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:51.370
Prof: I think we're not
doing that one this afternoon.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.600
It's actually very suggestive,
right?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.779
That there is--that beneath
government,

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:05.127
outside the actions of the
state, there is an enormously

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:10.767
intricate system of informal
property which governs the way

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:13.199
we actually function.
 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:18.649
That system of property can be
good,

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:20.990
bad, or indifferent,
it can be just or unjust,

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.079
it can be notoriously
inefficient, and in fact,

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:32.120
if you think about the failure
of socialist regimes,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.512
one important explanation is
that the underlying informal

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:43.098
norms about what people do with
their work lives were never

00:06:43.098 --> 00:06:49.069
integrated with the planned
economies in an effective way.

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:55.040
Now--so that's something about
formality and informality.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.857
I also have here a watch,
it says on the top Movado,

00:07:01.857 --> 00:07:09.209
it's really very handsome and I
really don't need it.

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:10.689
I'm thinking of selling it.
 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:18.740
Does anybody have any--does
anybody need a watch?

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.089
You do?
 

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:23.879
You don't?
 

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:29.680
What does a standard Movado
watch sell for in a jewelry

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.540
store?
 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.329
I actually don't know.
 

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:35.430
I should have done my homework.
 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:41.608
I think its low hundreds and
I'd be willing to part with this

00:07:41.608 --> 00:07:43.050
one for $20.
 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.050
Student:  Deal.
 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.740
Prof: Who says deal?
 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.810
Be careful.
 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.084
Is it conceivable that the
proper retail price of this is

00:07:57.084 --> 00:07:58.019
less than $20?
 

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.639
Student:  I think you're
a pretty trustworthy guy.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:06.526
Prof: Remember what I'm
trying to demonstrate is

00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:08.699
information asymmetry.
 

00:08:08.699 --> 00:08:16.384
This watch is worth about $8,
and it's a--and if I sold it to

00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:23.942
you what I would be doing is
stealing from the manufacturer,

00:08:23.942 --> 00:08:26.889
stealing the brand.
 

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:32.128
One of the curious things about
watches these days--by the way,

00:08:32.128 --> 00:08:33.480
it works fine.
 

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.879
Somebody gave it to me for my
birthday as a joke,

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:42.320
it keeps, as far as I can tell,
perfect time,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.759
possibly better time than a
real Movado,

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:48.870
and there's an interesting
problem about watches,

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.830
right?
 

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:56.581
Which is better,
a $9 Casio, the cheapest

00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:05.522
imaginable Casio or Timex;
or a Rolex, if the question is

00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:08.190
keeping good time?
 

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.779
Student:  The Casio.
 

00:09:10.779 --> 00:09:11.320
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.820
Student:  Probably the
Casio.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.256
Prof: Yeah,
the Rolex is a mechanical

00:09:15.256 --> 00:09:18.375
movement of brilliantly designed
and executed mechanical

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.995
movement,
and it's not as good as an

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:27.577
ordinary electronic watch;
doesn't keep time as well,

00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:33.486
and yet people are willing to
pay thousand to one multiples

00:09:33.486 --> 00:09:37.460
for the social meaning of the
brand.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.865
That means that there's an
enormous market for cheaply made

00:09:43.865 --> 00:09:46.676
watches,
gray market watches,

00:09:46.676 --> 00:09:52.557
or even black market watches,
which knock off a brand name

00:09:52.557 --> 00:09:59.735
and which people sometimes buy
really thinking that it's the

00:09:59.735 --> 00:10:02.897
real deal,
but more often,

00:10:02.897 --> 00:10:09.019
just thinking it's kind of fun
to buy an expensive brand for,

00:10:09.019 --> 00:10:10.570
say, $20.
 

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:21.730
Well the Coase Theorem is about
those issues plus the one where

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:25.509
this girl is vexed.
 

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:31.176
And the one where she's vexed
is that the property rights to

00:10:31.176 --> 00:10:34.250
that toy are unclearly marked.
 

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:41.115
I have a granddaughter who got
the boss gene from her mother

00:10:41.115 --> 00:10:45.995
and she's a first--
kindergartner and her first day

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:49.932
at school they got out--
they brought out little plastic

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:53.750
ants for the children to learn
basic arithmetic with and they

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.485
put a pile of them on the--
in the middle of each table,

00:10:57.485 --> 00:10:58.788
and than four kids.
 

00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:05.523
And my granddaughter came home
complaining that the other kids

00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:07.509
had been to her.
 

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:11.700
So her mother talked to the
teacher the next day,

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.655
and the story was that our
grandchild had taken all the

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:24.605
ants and put them in a pile and
then begun negotiating bilateral

00:11:24.605 --> 00:11:30.120
agreements to give some to the
other students.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.450
They didn't like that.
 

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:40.663
Well, the Coase Theorem boiled
down is that if you have three

00:11:40.663 --> 00:11:45.517
conditions,
clear initial entitlements to

00:11:45.517 --> 00:11:51.089
property and this is what's
stressed most in the de Soto

00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:54.389
book;
clear entitlements to property;

00:11:54.389 --> 00:12:01.565
a high degree of transparency,
which is what's missing in the

00:12:01.565 --> 00:12:05.990
story about the bogus Movado
watch;

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:13.528
and low transaction costs.
 

00:12:13.528 --> 00:12:17.320
The Nobel Prize in Economics,
announced today--

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:23.504
they announced two of them,
but one of them went to Ollie

00:12:23.504 --> 00:12:26.912
Williamson,
formerly a colleague of ours

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:31.149
here at Yale,
for inventing and elaborating

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:35.620
the idea of transaction cost
economics.

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.010
By trans--have we talked a
little about transaction costs

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:40.558
here?
 

00:12:40.558 --> 00:12:45.879
About how hard it is to do--to
get a deal made?

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:51.187
You know what deal you want to
make, but the--all the red tape

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:56.408
that gets in the way makes it
very difficult to get there.

00:12:56.408 --> 00:13:05.269
Coase's principal point is that
in that tiny segment in the

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:13.270
middle of the Ven diagram,
where these three conditions

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:16.913
all obtain,
we should expect people to

00:13:16.913 --> 00:13:21.260
reach efficient allocations of
property no matter what the

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.940
initial allocation.
 

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.808
Now notice I didn't say,
and he doesn't say,

00:13:26.808 --> 00:13:30.678
fair or just allocations,
just efficient.

00:13:30.678 --> 00:13:36.524
And efficient in the sense that
people will trade to a point

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:41.178
where there are no further
opportunities to--

00:13:41.178 --> 00:13:45.114
for mutual gain,
and you get to a so called

00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:49.330
Pareto efficient or contract
curve outcome.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:54.032
And I'm going to--I don't do
this to you very often,

00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:59.379
but we're going to do this with
a graphic demonstration.

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:01.399
This is an Edgeworth box.
 

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:06.345
I used one once before--does
anybody have any trouble about

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.159
how an Edgeworth box is set up?
 

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:11.379
Hum if you are.
 

00:14:11.379 --> 00:14:15.840
Okay, so Smith is here,
Voltaire is there.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:20.581
Smith gets that much paper and
that quantity of pens,

00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:24.139
Voltaire gets the obverse
quantities.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:28.577
If we start at the red dot,
Voltaire's entitlements are

00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:33.178
shown by the blue lines and
Smith's by the pink lines.

00:14:33.178 --> 00:14:40.153
Voltaire would prefer
anything--any outcome beyond

00:14:40.153 --> 00:14:46.129
this indifference curve going
this way,

00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:53.390
away from his point of origin,
and Smith would prefer anything

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.629
that way from the pink
indifference curve.

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:04.522
So there is a set of outcomes
which are clearly superior to

00:15:04.522 --> 00:15:10.413
the starting point and they're
in that set, that lozenge in

00:15:10.413 --> 00:15:11.428
shape.
 

00:15:11.428 --> 00:15:15.793
And so they will trade to that,
and if we just set it up as

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:20.234
this is a rank order account of
what Smith wants and of what

00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:26.556
Voltaire wants,
S is that set of outcomes and

00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:30.370
those two--
S in the two diagrams is the

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.149
same thing.
 

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:35.428
Ultimately they'll get to an
outcome where the indifference

00:15:35.428 --> 00:15:38.379
curves are at tangency to one
another;

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:41.690
there's no further gain from
trade,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:47.316
and there will be a whole set
of outcomes that fit that

00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:52.548
description,
forming the contract curve,

00:15:52.548 --> 00:15:57.975
all those points,
and the contract curve will be

00:15:57.975 --> 00:16:03.666
equivalent to this possibility
frontier in the other style of

00:16:03.666 --> 00:16:04.710
diagram.
 

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:13.600
The--it's a really simple idea.
 

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.409
The way to use the Coase
Theorem though is backward.

00:16:18.409 --> 00:16:20.649
The Coase Theorem is boring.
 

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:25.090
Incidentally,
I was talking to my TA's this

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:31.432
morning about the first round of
memos, and they had only one

00:16:31.432 --> 00:16:35.980
complaint: that they were often
boring.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.181
Not bad, but there was none of
the author's personality in most

00:16:41.181 --> 00:16:42.019
of them.
 

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:48.326
You've all learned long since
how to write papers in college

00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:52.707
and get good grades,
but you ought to just

00:16:52.707 --> 00:16:56.769
occasionally put yourself into
it.

00:16:56.769 --> 00:17:03.028
Don't do it the standard way,
just go out on a limb.

00:17:03.028 --> 00:17:06.915
Now that's especially true if
you don't think you need to go

00:17:06.915 --> 00:17:09.420
to law school,
med school or an MBA.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.951
It's actually--I remember
making all the exact same

00:17:15.951 --> 00:17:21.308
calculations when I was where
you are,

00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:26.849
but a little risk taking in
writing actually endears you to

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:34.430
those who read the work,
and often actually pays off.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.367
An interesting thing about
writing: After your B.A.,

00:17:38.367 --> 00:17:43.078
taking risks with your writing
turns out to be the only way of

00:17:43.078 --> 00:17:44.470
getting ahead.
 

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:49.750
Standard issue writing pays up
to the B.A., and by and large

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.539
doesn't pay after.
 

00:17:51.539 --> 00:17:53.019
It's interesting.
 

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:55.989
At any rate,
I don't mean to alarm you about

00:17:55.989 --> 00:18:00.269
your grades, but I think it's
actually worth thinking about.

00:18:00.269 --> 00:18:05.400
I've mislabeled this.
 

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.250
The top label should read
Ghen v.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:16.234
Rich, and this is a case
about thinking out the

00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:23.778
incentives to make people behave
in productive ways.

00:18:23.778 --> 00:18:29.480
The story goes as follows:
Ghen is a whaler;

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:35.068
he operates out of Wellfleet,
Massachusetts.

00:18:35.068 --> 00:18:43.845
It is 1881 and he spots a
finback whale and sends the

00:18:43.845 --> 00:18:53.970
little boats out with his crew
and they harpoon the whale.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.765
Finbacks are big,
fast, aggressive,

00:18:57.765 --> 00:19:04.016
and they have one further
peculiarity, when you kill them

00:19:04.016 --> 00:19:08.368
they sink to the bottom of the
sea.

00:19:08.368 --> 00:19:14.723
Virtually all whales float when
killed and the general rule of

00:19:14.723 --> 00:19:20.869
property in whaling is finder's
keepers, loser's weepers.

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.848
You've all heard of that.
 

00:19:23.848 --> 00:19:30.538
The specific method is that
after you kill a whale you

00:19:30.538 --> 00:19:37.098
either lash it to your ship and
tow it to harbor,

00:19:37.098 --> 00:19:44.390
or slice it up and process it
at sea,

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.529
but these boats by and large
weren't big enough for that.

00:19:46.529 --> 00:19:50.933
Or you leave it floating and
put a marker on it,

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:54.868
and the marker is your--it's
your brand.

00:19:54.868 --> 00:19:58.094
It's like branding cattle,
and everybody then is compelled

00:19:58.094 --> 00:20:00.640
by law to acknowledge that it's
your whale.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:06.242
The finback presents a dilemma
because neither of those

00:20:06.242 --> 00:20:12.470
strategies is available to the
whaler who kills a finback.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:16.863
What happened to this
particular finback is that it

00:20:16.863 --> 00:20:22.487
floated up a day or two later on
the beach near Wellfleet on Cape

00:20:22.487 --> 00:20:23.190
Cod.
 

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:30.993
And a gentleman came along and
found it, and conducted a quick

00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:34.960
auction, and Ellis bought it.
 

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:41.478
Ellis bought the whale and
processed it into whale oil and

00:20:41.478 --> 00:20:46.082
other by products,
put them on the market and at

00:20:46.082 --> 00:20:50.000
this point,
Ghen returned from his voyage

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.730
and wanted his whale back.
 

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:59.808
He sued Ellis--Rich,
rather, sorry;

00:20:59.808 --> 00:21:02.250
Ellis is the guy on the beach
who found it.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.846
He sued Rich,
who had processed the oil for

00:21:06.846 --> 00:21:08.160
his money.
 

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.045
What happened was that the
judge ruled in favor of Ghen and

00:21:14.045 --> 00:21:18.105
reasoned--well,
let me not tell the whole

00:21:18.105 --> 00:21:19.118
story.
 

00:21:19.118 --> 00:21:25.818
Let's suppose you were hired as
attorney for the finback whales.

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:31.319
The finback whales hire you as
a lawyer and they want to get

00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:36.820
this case to come out so that
they will be safe from whaling

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.500
in the future.
 

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500
How would they have the judge
decide the case?

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:50.415
Back--
Student:  Decide in

00:21:50.415 --> 00:21:54.180
favor of Rich
&gt;

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:57.078
Prof: Okay,
exactly, and why?

00:21:57.078 --> 00:21:59.642
Student:  Because the
whalers were taking all the risk

00:21:59.642 --> 00:22:01.605
and all the time,
but they were not going to be

00:22:01.605 --> 00:22:02.930
able to bring the whale in.
 

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:06.144
And Rich gets all the--or
whoever finds the whale's body

00:22:06.144 --> 00:22:09.358
two days later gets all the
profit, why harpoon them?

00:22:09.358 --> 00:22:11.079
It's completely
&gt;

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:11.269
Prof: Okay, perfect.
 

00:22:11.269 --> 00:22:15.098
The judge reasoned,
just as suggested,

00:22:15.098 --> 00:22:20.326
that only by honoring the
relatively indirect claim to

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:23.780
property,
which Ghen was urging,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:29.769
could the industry of whaling
for whalebacks be incented so

00:22:29.769 --> 00:22:33.588
that it would go on in the
future.

00:22:33.588 --> 00:22:41.529
Now a lot of things we're doing
and thinking about are analogous

00:22:41.529 --> 00:22:42.788
to that.
 

00:22:42.788 --> 00:22:49.473
Structuring incentives so that
people behave in ways which

00:22:49.473 --> 00:22:56.509
increase the wealth of society
while trying to increase their

00:22:56.509 --> 00:23:03.077
own wealth in effect creating
conditions analogous to the

00:23:03.077 --> 00:23:09.880
invisible hand in Smith is what
the judge was doing.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.800
It's actually--you should
Google it, it's only three pages

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.140
long, and just read the opinion.
 

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:21.134
Because it brings out the
fundamental issues that we're

00:23:21.134 --> 00:23:23.170
trying to deal with.
 

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:26.400
Now de Soto in America.
 

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:33.990
De Soto talks in the early
parts of the book which we read

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.318
at the opening of term.
 

00:23:37.318 --> 00:23:43.259
De Soto talks mainly about
emerging market countries.

00:23:43.259 --> 00:23:51.058
The gist is that they are
loaded with dead capital.

00:23:51.058 --> 00:23:56.630
Can somebody help us with the
notion of dead capital?

00:23:56.630 --> 00:24:04.338
Here we go.
 

00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:10.083
Student:  De Soto argues
that why capital serves both as

00:24:10.083 --> 00:24:15.269
purpose as a house and kind of
second like is to serve to

00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:18.420
backing of future investments.
 

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.438
Like in a country where you
have a legal right over your

00:24:22.438 --> 00:24:25.578
house, it can't serve the second
purpose.

00:24:25.578 --> 00:24:30.887
Prof: Okay so the
house--let's take the chair you

00:24:30.887 --> 00:24:31.950
own here.
 

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:35.618
Is it dead capital or live
capital?

00:24:35.618 --> 00:24:40.080
Student:  Well it's not
alive to me because I don't own

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.298
it but to the university maybe
it's alive.

00:24:43.298 --> 00:24:44.769
Prof: Okay,
that's well put.

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:50.320
We will in fact look at the
title to this room in a few

00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.348
minutes.
 

00:24:51.348 --> 00:24:59.058
The--de Soto's idea is that in
an informal system of property

00:24:59.058 --> 00:25:06.510
which has not been integrated
with a governmental system of

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.894
property,
people have capital,

00:25:09.894 --> 00:25:14.012
but it is dead in the sense
that it can't be used for

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:18.715
collateral against a loan,
and if it is sold,

00:25:18.715 --> 00:25:26.082
there is no way to enforce the
contract on the sale except

00:25:26.082 --> 00:25:30.470
mafia style,
and mafia style often doesn't

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.390
work out all that well.
 

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:41.088
The chapter we read for today
is about the proposition that

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:49.940
the advanced economies didn't
get to having live capital all

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.740
at once.
 

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:56.519
It came through a long process,
and de Soto,

00:25:56.519 --> 00:26:00.571
in this chapter,
talks through the informal

00:26:00.571 --> 00:26:05.685
practices of property which grew
up in mining camps in

00:26:05.685 --> 00:26:10.054
California,
in agricultural communities in

00:26:10.054 --> 00:26:13.348
Iowa and other Midwestern
states,

00:26:13.348 --> 00:26:21.680
in claims to land in colonial
America.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:29.867
What I'd like to do is start at
the present and then work our

00:26:29.867 --> 00:26:31.368
way back.
 

00:26:31.368 --> 00:26:40.509
This is a property map of our
present neighborhood.

00:26:40.509 --> 00:26:46.788
This is an official government
map from the place where deeds

00:26:46.788 --> 00:26:53.486
are kept at 200 Orange Street in
New Haven and in every community

00:26:53.486 --> 00:26:59.137
in the United States you will
find a set of deeds and a

00:26:59.137 --> 00:27:04.578
corresponding set of maps
similar to this one.

00:27:04.578 --> 00:27:08.868
I'll dissect this and enlarge
parts of it and so on as we go.

00:27:08.868 --> 00:27:16.170
You'll find these maps are
quite ubiquitous.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.710
Now this one has the
peculiarity that in some parts

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:24.170
of the city they've drawn in the
buildings and it turns out that

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:26.858
that's--
that has happened where there

00:27:26.858 --> 00:27:30.220
is a wealthy institution that
paid to have it done,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:34.665
familiar to all of us and not
where there isn't a wealthy

00:27:34.665 --> 00:27:38.240
institution that would pay to
have it done.

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.332
The green lines represent
property parcels and all this is

00:27:44.332 --> 00:27:49.842
entirely accessible if you go--
if you Google Visionappraisal,

00:27:49.842 --> 00:27:53.042
one word,
Visionappraisal New Haven,

00:27:53.042 --> 00:27:58.941
you'll get all these files and
you'll get a photograph of every

00:27:58.941 --> 00:28:01.509
structure to go with it.
 

00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:08.709
Here we have a particular
parcel that includes and

00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:12.528
surrounds this building.
 

00:28:12.528 --> 00:28:19.788
There's a close up of the
building and we're in the--you

00:28:19.788 --> 00:28:23.220
can see the match there.
 

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:29.011
Let's look at three properties
first and then we'll look at

00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:34.405
some more and we'll see how
structures of ownership get

00:28:34.405 --> 00:28:39.299
built around the formalized
property parcels;

00:28:39.299 --> 00:28:43.048
61 High Street is this building.
 

00:28:43.048 --> 00:28:45.630
Anybody know what 64 High
Street is?

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:51.740
No idea?
 

00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:55.143
What's the small stone--small
brownstone building across the

00:28:55.143 --> 00:28:55.490
way?
 

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.568
Student:  Skull and
bones.

00:28:57.568 --> 00:29:02.066
Prof: Skull and bones,
and skull and bones turns out

00:29:02.066 --> 00:29:06.328
for property purposes to be
called The Russell Trust and

00:29:06.328 --> 00:29:09.480
we'll look at that,
and 41 High Street?

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:15.496
I was just there,
is Starbuck's and some other

00:29:15.496 --> 00:29:18.170
property above it.
 

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:37.960
Let's look at--well I--1066
Chapel is actually Starbuck's,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.298
I was mistaken in what I said a
minute ago,

00:29:40.298 --> 00:29:44.058
41 High is the building right
behind Starbuck's.

00:29:44.058 --> 00:29:46.950
This is what you find on the
land records.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:55.710
This building is Parcel 14188,
map 261, block 252.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:02.076
It has an effective total area,
and this means places you could

00:30:02.076 --> 00:30:06.594
do anything with,
and this would count every

00:30:06.594 --> 00:30:10.480
square foot of indoor or outdoor
space,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.578
and it totals a little over
100,000,

00:30:14.578 --> 00:30:18.640
of which 9,259 is heated indoor
space.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:28.151
Its asserted value from the
city is $2.68 million for the

00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:31.646
land,
$4.97 million for the building,

00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:35.440
$7.65 million all together and
of that $7.65 million,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:42.038
$7.65 million is exempt from
taxes in the city,

00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:44.720
and that's a point of interest
to the city.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.304
What I'm trying to get you to
do is just get into the details

00:30:49.304 --> 00:30:52.818
of this stuff and see how
interesting it is.

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:58.359
The net value to the city for
tax purposes is zero,

00:30:58.359 --> 00:31:01.019
owner Yale University.
 

00:31:01.019 --> 00:31:08.499
Now compare this to 1066 Chapel
where the numbers are smaller

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:15.604
because the buildings are
smaller and they're nowhere near

00:31:15.604 --> 00:31:17.098
as good.
 

00:31:17.098 --> 00:31:24.528
The net taxable value is
$500,000.

00:31:24.528 --> 00:31:28.690
The owner is something called
Chapel Investments,

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:29.210
LLC.
 

00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:37.009
Chapel Investments,
LLC is owned by people I know,

00:31:37.009 --> 00:31:43.117
the Warrick family,
and they own four parcels over

00:31:43.117 --> 00:31:45.497
there,
including the one in which

00:31:45.497 --> 00:31:48.108
Caesar Pelli has his
architectural office and so on,

00:31:48.108 --> 00:31:52.808
and it is organized as a
taxable corp--

00:31:52.808 --> 00:31:59.674
a taxable LLC which is--this is
a hybrid form which we'll get to

00:31:59.674 --> 00:32:02.400
at the end of the hour.
 

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.903
Now let's take the value of
this building and the way it

00:32:06.903 --> 00:32:09.278
looks to Yale and the city.
 

00:32:09.278 --> 00:32:15.256
If we wanted to mark-to-market
Lindsey Chittenden Hall,

00:32:15.256 --> 00:32:20.236
we want to say,
"What would this building

00:32:20.236 --> 00:32:22.450
really sell for?
 

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:27.619
This building and the land in
question."

00:32:27.619 --> 00:32:30.650
How would we go about that?
 

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:32.058
Who's got an estimate?
 

00:32:32.058 --> 00:32:36.200
More or less than $7.65 million
dollars?

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.430
More, who said more?
 

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:49.890
Okay there we go.
 

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.759
Why do you think so?
 

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.558
(32:55--starts to get
choppy--audio is fine).

00:32:53.558 --> 00:32:55.192
Student:  It's a
building that has a lot of

00:32:55.192 --> 00:32:57.058
history and a lot of alumni
might be interested in it.

00:32:57.058 --> 00:33:00.761
It has beautiful artwork,
nice carving,

00:33:00.761 --> 00:33:04.269
you know, you could put a pool
in.

00:33:04.269 --> 00:33:07.310
Prof: Okay,
does it look like it's well

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:08.190
maintained?
 

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.838
Student:  Yeah,
very well maintained.

00:33:09.838 --> 00:33:13.763
Prof: Might buying this
have any resemblance to buying a

00:33:13.763 --> 00:33:15.980
Movado watch of this
description?

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:21.573
Let's suppose I want to run
a--some kind of a commercial

00:33:21.573 --> 00:33:26.834
educational institution,
what would this building be

00:33:26.834 --> 00:33:31.064
worth if I were--
suppose I were going to run

00:33:31.064 --> 00:33:36.173
something which was aimed at
wealthy kids with bad test

00:33:36.173 --> 00:33:37.118
scores.
 

00:33:37.118 --> 00:33:40.272
Student:  It would be
nice to be associated with the

00:33:40.272 --> 00:33:40.980
Yale brand.
 

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.660
Prof: Yeah I might name
it Rae College at Yale.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.990
That has a ring to it, right?
 

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:54.231
The building--use that--that
might be the highest and best

00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:55.868
use of the building.
 

00:33:55.868 --> 00:33:59.121
Anybody else got a thought
about what--yes,

00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:00.048
Tom is it?
 

00:34:00.048 --> 00:34:02.111
Student:  You're going
to have to start paying taxes on

00:34:02.111 --> 00:34:02.279
it?
 

00:34:02.279 --> 00:34:02.900
Prof: I am.
 

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.971
Well, unless I can get it made
into a 501(c)(3),

00:34:06.971 --> 00:34:11.476
nonprofit corporation,
in which case I might get away

00:34:11.476 --> 00:34:13.730
with not paying taxes.
 

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:20.699
Any other use anybody can
imagine for this thing?

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:26.119
Come on--yes.
 

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:29.780
Student:  I would
actually argue that property

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.807
value would be lower because the
building is

00:34:32.807 --> 00:34:34.849
&gt;
 

00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:43.396
that in some ways it's unlikely
to find anybody who would value

00:34:43.396 --> 00:34:49.739
it as much as this
&gt;

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:54.244
Prof: Well I--can we
think of anything unrelated to

00:34:54.244 --> 00:34:57.010
education you could do with
this?

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:03.018
Could it be a resort?
 

00:35:03.018 --> 00:35:07.110
Student:  I'd make it a
movie theatre.

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:07.690
Prof: Pardon.
 

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.289
Student:  I'd make it a
movie theatre.

00:35:09.289 --> 00:35:11.389
Prof: You would make it
a movie theatre.

00:35:11.389 --> 00:35:14.079
Well I got to tell you I think
that's a really bad idea.

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:21.572
If you study the current
economics of movie theatres,

00:35:21.572 --> 00:35:23.590
don't do it.
 

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.210
Anybody else?
 

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:29.929
Student:  You don't have
to look at the alternatives,

00:35:29.929 --> 00:35:32.545
you can look at how much Yale
invested in renovating this

00:35:32.545 --> 00:35:35.393
building as an indication of how
much Yale values it and so if

00:35:35.393 --> 00:35:37.449
Yale didn't own it it would be
able to--

00:35:37.449 --> 00:35:39.329
it would be willing to pay a
tremendous amount of money,

00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:41.570
I think, to buy it and that
would give it a lot of value.

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.510
Prof: Well,
that's right and that,

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:47.206
by the way, is a good reason to
think that they're not going to

00:35:47.206 --> 00:35:50.844
sell it for any price that we
could even imagine capturing the

00:35:50.844 --> 00:35:51.739
value from.
 

00:35:51.739 --> 00:35:54.199
I think that's right.
 

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:59.369
Now, the other property is
probably already--

00:35:59.369 --> 00:36:04.090
the Starbuck's one is probably
already pretty much at highest

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.710
and best use and is therefore
uninteresting.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:11.934
Now let's think about the
properties on the other end of

00:36:11.934 --> 00:36:16.389
the block across Chapel Street,
the end down toward the New

00:36:16.389 --> 00:36:17.619
Haven green.
 

00:36:17.619 --> 00:36:21.840
There's a large assembly,
there are about fifteen parcels

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:22.820
down there.
 

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.059
I picked out three.
 

00:36:24.059 --> 00:36:30.860
They all look like this.
 

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.199
They all belong to something
called The Chapel Company.

00:36:33.199 --> 00:36:37.730
Who can make a guess what The
Chapel Company might be?

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:43.719
Well I'll tell you--yes?
 

00:36:43.719 --> 00:36:45.449
Student:  I was going to
say possibly Yale.

00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:48.440
Prof: How perceptive.
 

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.166
Here's the story:
Twenty-five years ago,

00:36:53.166 --> 00:37:00.438
a Yale college alum named Joel
Schiavone, who is an irascible

00:37:00.438 --> 00:37:03.469
and brilliant fellow.
 

00:37:03.469 --> 00:37:07.663
He has the same educational
pattern as Jim Alexander here,

00:37:07.663 --> 00:37:10.900
Yale College,
and Harvard Business School.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:17.039
He bought--it was a slum,
all these--this whole area down

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:20.219
here was a commercial slum.
 

00:37:20.219 --> 00:37:25.273
The buildings were in
disrepair, they were being used

00:37:25.273 --> 00:37:30.610
for very marginal purposes,
and he bought the whole thing

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:34.449
up for not very much and began
renovating it.

00:37:34.449 --> 00:37:37.510
The renovation model was small
retail.

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:42.405
Small retail with quality
residential on the second and

00:37:42.405 --> 00:37:47.574
third floors and we're talking
about places like The Union

00:37:47.574 --> 00:37:53.981
League and Claire's Cornercopia,
and The Schubert Theatre and

00:37:53.981 --> 00:37:58.449
The Taft Hotel now The Taft
Condominium.

00:37:58.449 --> 00:38:03.387
He fixed it all up and made it
really sing and one of his

00:38:03.387 --> 00:38:08.588
precepts was every property
should be leased to somebody who

00:38:08.588 --> 00:38:13.878
owns their own business and is
willing to work really hard at

00:38:13.878 --> 00:38:15.730
making it work.
 

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:19.960
He didn't go after chains he
went after entrepreneurs.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.302
The thing really worked
beautifully but Schiavone is one

00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:29.199
these guys who--he's got the
spirit of Schumpeter about him.

00:38:29.199 --> 00:38:30.750
He can never leave well enough
alone.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.096
He gets interested in other
things and leverages the new

00:38:35.096 --> 00:38:39.679
things by taking further
mortgages on all this property.

00:38:39.679 --> 00:38:46.719
Then in the 1980s there is a
huge real estate recession,

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:51.896
and he loses it all to a
federal--the federal government

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:57.639
buys all the property for very
little and then auctions it off

00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:03.157
for something called the RTC,
and Yale hires a guy named Joe

00:39:03.157 --> 00:39:07.331
Fahey who was a student of mine
at SOM at the time this

00:39:07.331 --> 00:39:08.260
happened.
 

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.570
He now runs all of Disney's
real estate,

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:18.164
and Fahey invented The Chapel
Company and bought all of

00:39:18.164 --> 00:39:25.246
Schiavone's property on Yale's
behalf for about $.25 on the

00:39:25.246 --> 00:39:26.590
dollar.
 

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.909
Yale has had the good judgment,
in my opinion,

00:39:30.909 --> 00:39:33.527
to leave it all functioning as
if it were private commercial

00:39:33.527 --> 00:39:36.338
property,
and the neighborhood is

00:39:36.338 --> 00:39:42.483
strengthened enormously by that
and Yale does not make a lot of

00:39:42.483 --> 00:39:46.672
money at it,
but it indirectly gets a lot of

00:39:46.672 --> 00:39:51.543
benefit by having a strong
commercial neighborhood abutting

00:39:51.543 --> 00:39:52.719
the campus.
 

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:55.530
We're not quite ready for that.
 

00:39:55.530 --> 00:40:04.150
Well let's not use the maps but
let's do--let's talk about

00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:11.409
properties further up in the
middle of campus.

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:16.230
I'd like you to focus on 140
High Street and 306 York Street.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:22.585
140 High Street is the Yale Law
School ,and its taxable value is

00:40:22.585 --> 00:40:27.326
$42 million dollars,
that's the building not the

00:40:27.326 --> 00:40:28.940
institution.
 

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:35.577
Across York Street is Mory's,
or more exactly,

00:40:35.577 --> 00:40:38.380
The Mory's Trust.
 

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.579
What do you think Mory's is
worth?

00:40:42.579 --> 00:40:50.530
Well the tax estimate is
$400,000 and a little bit.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.210
Who would be prepared to buy
Mory's for $400,000?

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.809
No takers?
 

00:40:58.809 --> 00:41:03.139
Anybody tempted?
 

00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:11.420
Okay, why are we so cautious
about Mory's?

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.239
Student: 
&gt;

00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:12.958
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:41:12.958 --> 00:41:14.179
Student:  Why are we
what?

00:41:14.179 --> 00:41:16.789
Prof: Why are cautious
about Mory's?

00:41:16.789 --> 00:41:19.429
Student:  Well,
because it's failing right now.

00:41:19.429 --> 00:41:22.570
Prof: It closed its
doors on December 19 last year,

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.949
what's wrong with that?
 

00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:29.780
Student:  It would make
me skeptical about the area,

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.394
like maybe there's something
wrong with the business around

00:41:33.394 --> 00:41:35.114
it,
or what's around it would make

00:41:35.114 --> 00:41:36.909
it less valuable as a commercial
space.

00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:40.052
Prof: Okay,
yeah, it's sure a rundown

00:41:40.052 --> 00:41:41.150
neighborhood.
 

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.873
You've got the Yale Hall of
Graduate Studies,

00:41:43.873 --> 00:41:45.050
Morrison, Stiles.
 

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:49.097
Student:  No,
I mean as opposed to the Chapel

00:41:49.097 --> 00:41:54.021
area where there's a whole area
that is like a commercial area,

00:41:54.021 --> 00:41:56.800
and maybe sort of out of place.
 

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.914
I would consider buying it
personally because I think it

00:41:59.914 --> 00:42:04.005
could be used effectively
Prof: I am the chairman

00:42:04.005 --> 00:42:06.929
of the group that in fact owns
it.

00:42:06.929 --> 00:42:13.862
I'm going to try not to take
offense at the way you guys

00:42:13.862 --> 00:42:15.250
value it.
 

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:20.938
We're investing $3 million
dollars in it over the next four

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:26.920
months and we plan to open it
and have all of you clamoring to

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:31.172
get through the front door,
or the backdoor,

00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:33.610
which will be the Whiffenpoof
Bar.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:39.599
Now in evaluating it you do
have to take into account lots

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:46.007
of things that aren't bricks and
mortar, and I'm glad you said

00:42:46.007 --> 00:42:47.900
what you said.
 

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.983
You're blaming the neighborhood
for what is in fact a

00:42:50.983 --> 00:42:53.119
spectacularly mismanaged
business.

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:58.579
Did anybody eat in Mory's last
year?

00:42:58.579 --> 00:43:04.012
Can you--can we get the
microphone to this lady,

00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:09.215
we're going to a--on a one to
five star basis,

00:43:09.215 --> 00:43:11.760
what's the rating?
 

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.193
Student:  You mean,
compared to dining hall food

00:43:14.193 --> 00:43:17.009
or--
Prof: Compared to food

00:43:17.009 --> 00:43:21.750
that costs about the same thing
on the private market.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:26.836
Student:  I mean,
I was never paying but--I mean

00:43:26.836 --> 00:43:27.780
a three.
 

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:29.940
Prof: A three?
 

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.820
Student:  The food's not
that good but it's really fun.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.260
Student:  I'd say a one.
 

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:37.052
Prof: Okay the fun part
was the singing,

00:43:37.052 --> 00:43:39.239
the memorabilia,
the cockroaches .

00:43:39.239 --> 00:43:45.449
no, I'm kidding but the food
was notorious.

00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:48.309
It was really bad.
 

00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:50.280
How well did they do at serving
drinks?

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.170
Student:  Very well.
 

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.090
Prof: I mean, horrible.
 

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:59.802
There was no bar,
the tables down at Maury's had

00:43:59.802 --> 00:44:05.115
no bar, and it failed partly
because it was very badly

00:44:05.115 --> 00:44:06.320
managed.
 

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.284
It was managed by fifteen Yale
alumni, not one of whom knew

00:44:11.284 --> 00:44:13.510
anything about business.
 

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.639
That's a little harsh.
 

00:44:16.639 --> 00:44:21.907
Not one of whom knew anything
about business except for being

00:44:21.907 --> 00:44:25.418
a stockbroker,
which is a pretty abstract

00:44:25.418 --> 00:44:26.559
business.
 

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:31.869
There are no cooks in a
brokerage house.

00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:37.184
The other side of it,
and we'll actually do this case

00:44:37.184 --> 00:44:39.230
before we're done.
 

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:46.405
The other side of it was a
highly restrictive labor union

00:44:46.405 --> 00:44:53.326
contract with Local 217,
here and that contract doesn't

00:44:53.326 --> 00:44:57.940
go away when you close the door.
 

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:03.329
It turns out under Connecticut
labor law that the contract,

00:45:03.329 --> 00:45:08.233
if you reopen a restaurant
there, you would normally expect

00:45:08.233 --> 00:45:11.530
you would have to honor the
contract.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.512
Now it turns out we have a
loophole that's going to get us

00:45:15.512 --> 00:45:17.750
more--a better deal than that.
 

00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:21.855
I'll give you an idea of what
the--so what that means is that

00:45:21.855 --> 00:45:26.166
given the labor law the value of
the building is affected by the

00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:28.630
existence of the union contract.
 

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:34.590
It becomes almost like paint in
the way it adheres to the thing.

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:36.565
It included,
for example,

00:45:36.565 --> 00:45:41.590
the provision that there should
be four people called cashiers

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:47.503
who count the cash each night;
only one on duty each night,

00:45:47.503 --> 00:45:49.059
they rotated.
 

00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:50.739
They were all part timers.
 

00:45:50.739 --> 00:45:54.630
One of them was s full time
teacher at a local high school,

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.460
and they were required that
you--we were required to pay

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:02.222
them four hours for each
appearance and each appearance

00:46:02.222 --> 00:46:05.436
was--
how much cash do you think you

00:46:05.436 --> 00:46:09.659
take in these days in a
restaurant of that kind?

00:46:09.659 --> 00:46:13.594
None;
there might on a good night be

00:46:13.594 --> 00:46:18.485
$100 to count but the contract
obliged Mory's to employ these

00:46:18.485 --> 00:46:22.559
guys, and worse yet,
to pay them vacation time.

00:46:22.559 --> 00:46:28.793
We have a high school teacher
being paid five days of vacation

00:46:28.793 --> 00:46:34.210
time by Mory's while he is on
vacation, paid vacation,

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:37.889
from The Branford School
System.

00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:39.289
That's a deal.
 

00:46:39.289 --> 00:46:45.635
Analyzing what gets built on
this framework is a little

00:46:45.635 --> 00:46:46.809
complex.
 

00:46:46.809 --> 00:46:58.538
Let's go through the big story
in de Soto about the informal

00:46:58.538 --> 00:47:06.489
property systems in the United
States.

00:47:06.489 --> 00:47:11.369
Can anybody summarize it for us
in 100 words?

00:47:11.369 --> 00:47:15.199
Got a taker out there?
 

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:23.070
Are you headed for a taker?
 

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:29.699
Okay I'll do it.
 

00:47:29.699 --> 00:47:37.518
The system of property is built
on nation states.

00:47:37.518 --> 00:47:39.480
Nation states are the
underlying unit.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:45.144
When you have a frontier
society, which the United States

00:47:45.144 --> 00:47:50.530
remained until about 1880,
you have a vast area where

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:56.563
there is effectively no state or
if there is a state it is a very

00:47:56.563 --> 00:48:01.559
weak state with very limited
capacities to enforce any

00:48:01.559 --> 00:48:03.539
property system.
 

00:48:03.539 --> 00:48:06.791
The key Green v.
 

00:48:06.791 --> 00:48:13.639
Bittle case,
which arose in Kentucky,

00:48:13.639 --> 00:48:18.090
asserted the following.
 

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:22.119
It said informal property
rights count for nothing,

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:27.074
only formal property rights
issued by a part of the United

00:48:27.074 --> 00:48:30.072
States Government,
at either the federal or the

00:48:30.072 --> 00:48:32.250
state level,
count as real.

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:38.530
This provoked a rebellion that
included violence.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:43.659
It also created an enormous
inefficiency because the

00:48:43.659 --> 00:48:48.791
existing informal system of
property rights based on

00:48:48.791 --> 00:48:54.527
preemption and occupation,
so called Tomahawk rights or

00:48:54.527 --> 00:48:57.525
cornfield rights;
you occupy the land,

00:48:57.525 --> 00:49:00.619
improve the land,
demonstrate that you're making

00:49:00.619 --> 00:49:03.780
a living from the land,
and it becomes yours.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.909
Homesteading was the name for
it.

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:14.313
In 1862, The Homestead Act,
adopted into Federal law that

00:49:14.313 --> 00:49:23.469
system of informal law and made
an integration between the two

00:49:23.469 --> 00:49:25.119
levels.
 

00:49:25.119 --> 00:49:36.599
The wealth that was built in
the United States in the--

00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:41.021
in everything outside the
original East Coast colonies is

00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:45.760
built up on that peace treaty
between formal and informal.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:50.300
The--he does a brilliant job,
de Soto does,

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:55.009
with the mining camps in
California and with the land

00:49:55.009 --> 00:49:58.360
claim associations in the
Midwest,

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.820
and you can read the details
for yourselves.

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:06.349
The gist is that a well
functioning system of property

00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:12.715
will have both the formal and
the informal rights in sync with

00:50:12.715 --> 00:50:17.449
one another,
not in tension with one another.

00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:25.186
If we go finally to the finer
details of business

00:50:25.186 --> 00:50:29.699
structure--we're done now.
 

00:50:29.699 --> 00:50:32.449
I'll use this at the beginning
of class on Wednesday.

00:50:32.449 --> 00:50:36.960
I'll talk about how Mory's is
being restructured and you

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:40.010
should--
the case as scheduled for

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:45.719
Wednesday is the one about the
mortgage meltdown in Cleveland,

00:50:45.719 --> 00:50:51.099
Ohio and the URL has been
posted on Classes V2.

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:56.000

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.750
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.318
I have to get started because
there is, of course,

00:00:08.318 --> 00:00:12.750
a lot to be said about Sigmund
Freud.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.227
Actually it's a shame I have
only fifty minutes for it and

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:23.900
not two or three lectures.
 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.422
Just before I get into Freud,
I just want to tell you that I

00:00:30.422 --> 00:00:35.960
did send the questions already;
emailed it to you.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.935
So if you check your email,
you have the questions for next

00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:39.500
Thursday.
 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.256
And I strongly encourage you to
attend the lectures and the

00:00:44.256 --> 00:00:46.060
discussion sections.
 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.420
Those questions are not
necessarily very easy.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.687
So you may want to get more
exposure beyond the readings to

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:58.140
have a good handle on it.
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.220
And let me just very,
very briefly come back to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.420
Nietzsche, before we go on to
Freud.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.299
Though I have enough on Freud,
more than enough for today.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.933
But I would like to still kind
of wrap it up and to say what

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:17.938
the bottom line is.
 

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:23.159
And the big question is,
to start with,

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.280
what is genealogical method?
 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.640
What is new in Nietzsche's
approach?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.819
And it should be clear from the
writings and from the lecture,

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.819
and I think from the discussion
sections--

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:45.057
right?--that what he's
suggesting, that in the

00:01:45.057 --> 00:01:50.047
genealogical method you will
take an ideal and a moral

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:54.352
principle,
what you think is the right

00:01:54.352 --> 00:02:00.891
idea, and then he will show that
one can think about this idea

00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:04.155
differently;
and historically they did think

00:02:04.155 --> 00:02:04.849
differently.
 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.020
And his major example is good.
 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.750
You think an idea of what good
is;

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.020
it's uncontestable,
easy to agree?

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.470
Well I will show you that in
history the notion of good--and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.486
it's opposite,
what is not good--has been

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:24.598
constructed differently.
 

00:02:24.598 --> 00:02:28.044
So the point of departure,
first of all:

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:32.461
well, there is the
Judeo-Christian morality of good

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:33.610
and evil.
 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.056
I will show--I will go back to
time, I'll go back to the

00:02:38.056 --> 00:02:42.342
antiquity--and I will show that
the notion of good was

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:44.039
completely different.
 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.930
Right?
 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.699
That is the genealogical method.
 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:54.693
But to do it consistently,
he really should be claiming

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:58.690
that going back to the
antiquity--

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.903
I'm not suggesting that the
good in antiquity was the real

00:03:02.903 --> 00:03:03.274
good.
 

00:03:03.274 --> 00:03:03.938
Right?
 

00:03:03.938 --> 00:03:08.837
It's just a comparative study,
which relativizes the idea of

00:03:08.837 --> 00:03:14.092
good in your mind today,
to make you aware that good has

00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:19.050
been thought about differently
in different times.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.205
And, in particular,
of course, his main focus is on

00:03:24.205 --> 00:03:28.639
the notion of morality in modern
society.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.294
And he said well there is
something unique about this

00:03:32.294 --> 00:03:36.842
modern society;
namely that morality somehow is

00:03:36.842 --> 00:03:42.858
internalized into us,
and we kind of accept our own

00:03:42.858 --> 00:03:49.794
subjugation and our oppression
because these values are so

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:53.080
deeply invested into us.
 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.471
So that is, in a
way--right?--the genealogical

00:03:55.471 --> 00:03:56.865
method;
not to have,

00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.830
as I said in the lecture,
a critical vantage point.

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.836
Try to get a way that I will
give you the real universal

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:09.848
definition of good,
and I will criticize any

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:14.789
question of morality from a
universal concept of morality.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:17.778
That's not what he does. Right?
 

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:24.350
His major aim is to show that
all moralities,

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.317
all conceptions of
moralities--all conceptions what

00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:34.846
is justice,
what is fair,

00:04:34.846 --> 00:04:39.699
what is humane--has been
manufactured--

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.540
right?--in the workshop of
ideals.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.555
And this workshops of ideals is
a dark place where actually

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:55.119
coercion, torture,
is being used to manufacture

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:58.990
these seemingly great ideas.
 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.990
It's all about control over
humans.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.985
That's in a
nutshell--right?--what Nietzsche

00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:07.240
is trying to do.
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.855
So let me just make a step back
to Marx and foreshadow a step

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.949
forward to Freud.
 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.684
So this Nietzsche has really
little disagreement with Marx's

00:05:21.684 --> 00:05:23.920
theory of alienation.
 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.437
He said, "Well,
as long as Marx is saying that

00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:31.238
in the modern world we are
alienated because we are not

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:35.920
masters of our own fate,
I agree with him." Right?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.067
We are alien in this world and
we do not have power over our

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:40.560
life.
 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.103
External conditions act like as
if it were nature,

00:05:45.103 --> 00:05:49.000
a thunderstorm,
and determines our life.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.540
He agrees with this
diagnosis--right?--of modernity.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.303
His problem with Marx is that
Marx comes to a solution.

00:05:58.303 --> 00:05:59.009
Right?
 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.564
Marx says, "Well,
I know what human emancipation

00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:04.439
will be.
 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.341
I know what good society will
be, and I know who will get us

00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:09.730
there." Right?
 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.860
"The proletariat."
 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.490
And he said,
"This is churlish;

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.129
that's no good." Right?
 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:22.350
"I won't do that.
 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.959
I won't fall into this
trap." Right?

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:27.310
"I will not manufacture
another ideal,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.452
because my workshop,
where ideals would be

00:06:30.452 --> 00:06:34.505
manufactured,
would be also a workshop which

00:06:34.505 --> 00:06:37.488
smells"--
right?--"and which is full

00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:42.589
with coercion,
and I would subject others to

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:46.810
torture--
mental or physical torture?

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.399
In the good old days it was
physical torture.

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:54.266
Today it's worse:
it is mental torture."

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:54.970
Right?
 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.406
That's in a
nutshell--right?--what he's

00:06:57.406 --> 00:06:58.690
trying to achieve.
 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.728
And, of course,
there is no Freud,

00:07:01.728 --> 00:07:05.411
there is no Weber,
and there is no Michel

00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.822
Foucault;
there is really no modern and

00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:13.019
post-modern social theory
without Nietzsche's insight.

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:16.932
This is a radicalization of
critical theory.

00:07:16.932 --> 00:07:17.660
Right?
 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.391
Critical theory--we talked
about this, from Hegel to

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:24.319
Marx--was a critique of
consciousness;

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.579
that what is in our mind is a
distortion of the reality.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:29.199
Right?
 

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:33.812
And therefore they were trying
to subject human consciousness

00:07:33.812 --> 00:07:35.579
to critical scrutiny.
 

00:07:35.579 --> 00:07:38.509
Nietzsche does it the most
radical way.

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:41.190
He said, "I am capable to
show"--

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.540
right?--"the shortcomings
of our consciousness,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.968
without showing you what is the
right consciousness."

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:49.589
Right?
 

00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:51.589
That's the project.
 

00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:55.439
Now Sigmund Freud has a lot of
similarities with this.

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.019
Right?
 

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:59.187
He's also a critical theorist,
and he says,

00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:03.713
"Well, what is in our mind
comes very deep down from the

00:08:03.713 --> 00:08:04.769
repressed.
 

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:08.788
And I will show
you"--right?--"how,

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:13.992
if this causes you neurotic
responses, I can actually cure

00:08:13.992 --> 00:08:17.958
you, by the way;
just I let you understand what

00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.375
has been repressed in your life
experience, and then you can do

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.800
something about yourself."
 

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.389
So that's in a nutshell Sigmund
Freud's contribution.

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:36.840
So it basically follows closely
to Nietzsche's ideas.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.240
And in the piece particularly
what I asked you to read today--

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.345
one of the pieces,
right?--Civilization and its

00:08:44.345 --> 00:08:47.312
Discontents,
he's struggling very much with

00:08:47.312 --> 00:08:49.779
the problem Nietzsche is
struggling with.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:53.928
He shows modern civilization as
repression.

00:08:53.928 --> 00:08:54.720
Right?
 

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.779
At the same time he does not
want to reject civilization.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:08:59.360
Right?
 

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:06.428
And he's tormented--right?--how
to evaluate civilization.

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:07.440
Right?
 

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:14.033
And well he probably is not
going as far as Nietzsche,

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:16.149
Nietzsche does.
 

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:17.870
We will see that when it comes.
 

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.750
Okay, this is Sigmund Freud.
 

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:25.230
And it's good advertising:
don't smoke.

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.490
You have his cigar.
 

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.870
He has actually oral cancer.
 

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:35.934
He was suffering from it during
the last twenty years of his

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:38.759
life, and eventually committed
suicide;

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:42.740
and the cancer obviously had
something to do with his cigars.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.710
So don't smoke. Right?
 

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:51.514
Well Freud was one of the
giants of nineteenth and early

00:09:51.514 --> 00:09:54.470
twentieth century thought.
 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:00.011
Many people who would name the
intellectual giants of this

00:10:00.011 --> 00:10:03.062
time,
nineteenth century,

00:10:03.062 --> 00:10:07.970
would name three names:
Charles Darwin,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.210
Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud.
 

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:12.019
Right?
 

00:10:12.019 --> 00:10:17.850
These are the three thinkers
which made us rethink ourself--

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:23.705
who we are, where we come from,
and what is the nature of the

00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:28.220
society we live in?--
the most radical ways.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:37.450
Okay, let me talk very briefly
about Freud's life.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.835
He was born in 1856,
in what is now the Czech

00:10:40.835 --> 00:10:44.220
Republic, Moravia,
southern part of the Czech

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.759
Republic, in a small city called
Freiberg.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:53.500
His father was a Jewish wool
merchant;

00:10:53.500 --> 00:11:00.715
he was already married to his
third wife--was about twenty

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:03.120
years his junior.
 

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.379
He was a pretty dominating
figure.

00:11:07.379 --> 00:11:10.267
The mother was,
on the other hand,

00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:12.980
a very sensitive human being.
 

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:20.176
In some ways Freud's troubled
relationship with the aging

00:11:20.176 --> 00:11:25.548
authoritarian father,
and with the soft-spoken,

00:11:25.548 --> 00:11:29.038
kind, forthcoming,
and warm mother,

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:34.850
does explain a lot about his
thinking about human life.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:40.808
Very soon after he was born,
they moved away from Freiberg.

00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:45.636
First briefly they were in
Leipzig and then they moved to

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:50.033
Vienna, and this is where
Sigmund Freud received his

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:51.240
education.
 

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.909
In 1873 he enrolled at the
University of Vienna.

00:11:56.909 --> 00:11:59.309
He was studying law for awhile.
 

00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:01.190
He got very bored with it.
 

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.250
So he shifted into medical
school, and received his medical

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:08.844
degree in '81,
and worked in the major

00:12:08.844 --> 00:12:14.049
university hospital in Vienna,
which is called General

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:14.860
Hospital.
 

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:25.158
In '85, very briefly he went to
study to Paris.

00:12:25.158 --> 00:12:30.615
And this was very crucial for
his change because he became

00:12:30.615 --> 00:12:35.951
interested here in neurology,
and especially became

00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:42.440
interested in a therapy what
French psychiatrists was use,

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.450
and that was hypnosis,
to treat hysteria.

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:52.288
And sort of he came back to
Vienna and he decided that he

00:12:52.288 --> 00:12:57.114
will now become a neurologist,
interested particularly in

00:12:57.114 --> 00:13:01.284
hysteria,
and will use hypnosis as a

00:13:01.284 --> 00:13:02.440
therapy.
 

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.870
He also married in '86--it was
a lifelong and,

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:15.278
you know, very peaceful
marriage--Martha Bernays,

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:20.798
who was a granddaughter of the
chief rabbi of Hamburg.

00:13:20.798 --> 00:13:25.139
So he's coming from a deeply
Jewish family,

00:13:25.139 --> 00:13:30.408
but he himself had very little
faith in his life.

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:34.693
He began to practice
psychotherapy,

00:13:34.693 --> 00:13:40.240
and he set up an office in
Bergstrasse 19;

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:45.538
19 Bergstrasse in central
Vienna.

00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:52.124
Here it is the house today
where Sigmund Freud started to

00:13:52.124 --> 00:13:57.178
practice, and practiced there
until 1938.

00:13:57.178 --> 00:14:02.515
And this is where
psychoanalysis was born--so an

00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:04.558
important house.
 

00:14:04.558 --> 00:14:12.474
So after '86--right?--he began
to collaborate with another

00:14:12.474 --> 00:14:16.639
psychologist,
Joseph Breuer.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:24.649
And Breuer was not using the
hypnotic method.

00:14:24.649 --> 00:14:28.816
What he did,
he did something what he called

00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:31.820
"the talking cure."
 

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.226
This is something what you
occasionally do,

00:14:35.226 --> 00:14:37.499
or your friends do with you.
 

00:14:37.499 --> 00:14:38.230
Right?
 

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.957
If something is on your chest,
then you call your friend and

00:14:41.957 --> 00:14:44.928
you say, "I need somebody
to talk to."

00:14:44.928 --> 00:14:45.558
Right?
 

00:14:45.558 --> 00:14:49.450
There is some real big trouble
in you;

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.706
you want somebody to listen.
 

00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:52.269
Right?
 

00:14:52.269 --> 00:14:54.168
Now this is exactly what Breuer
did.

00:14:54.168 --> 00:14:58.399
He did ask his patients to talk
to him.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:14:59.288
Right?
 

00:14:59.288 --> 00:15:04.336
And it turned out that this
talking cure was very effective,

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:07.244
as you've probably all
experienced.

00:15:07.244 --> 00:15:08.100
Right?
 

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.285
When something is on your chest
and you have a good friend who's

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:16.139
willing to listen and does not
rush to give you advice--

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:18.085
right?--this is whom you want.
 

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:18.538
Right?
 

00:15:18.538 --> 00:15:21.624
Just to listen and nod,
to be sympathetic,

00:15:21.624 --> 00:15:24.784
and try to understand you and
let you talk,

00:15:24.784 --> 00:15:28.547
and ask the good questions,
but not to give advice.

00:15:28.547 --> 00:15:29.450
Right?
 

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.278
That's what Breuer discovered.
 

00:15:31.278 --> 00:15:36.386
Well in 1895 they co-authored
the book Studies in

00:15:36.386 --> 00:15:37.889
Hysteria.
 

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:43.868
And now they actually in the
book suggest that there must be

00:15:43.868 --> 00:15:45.490
a new therapy.
 

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:50.350
Don't put people asleep but
make them talk and let them

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:53.769
freely associate,
and through this free

00:15:53.769 --> 00:15:56.918
association you throw words in.
 

00:15:56.918 --> 00:16:01.096
And then they're beginning to
freely associate to this world,

00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:04.230
you actually can
uncover--they're beginning to

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:06.320
use the term--unconscious.
 

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:09.914
There is an unconscious level
in each individual,

00:16:09.914 --> 00:16:13.660
and with this free association
you can dip into the

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:14.860
unconscious.
 

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.868
And, in fact,
it was Freud who,

00:16:18.868 --> 00:16:24.240
in doing this,
practicing this with patients,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.751
also began to understand that a
lot of stuff in the subconscious

00:16:30.751 --> 00:16:34.678
has something to do with
sexuality;

00:16:34.678 --> 00:16:37.470
that it is, you know,
unsatisfied,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:41.951
unachieved sexual desires,
which are kind of repressed

00:16:41.951 --> 00:16:44.149
into the subconscious.
 

00:16:44.149 --> 00:16:47.860
And when, through these free
associations,

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:52.111
he was digging into the
unconscious, he began to

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:55.279
discover a lot of sexual stuff.
 

00:16:55.279 --> 00:17:00.649
And then one year later it
is--right?--a very important day

00:17:00.649 --> 00:17:04.538
in the history of modern social
thought.

00:17:04.538 --> 00:17:10.099
In 1896 he finally has a name
for what he does,

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.089
and he calls it psychoanalysis.
 

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:18.670
And here it is.
 

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.369
If you have not seen this
picture yet, you should.

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.430
This was the famous couch.
 

00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.700
That's where the patient had to
lay down,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:31.243
and Freud was sitting in an
armchair and listening to what

00:17:31.243 --> 00:17:36.492
they got to say,
and asking just a couple of

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:39.118
probing questions.
 

00:17:39.118 --> 00:17:42.865
But the essence of
psychoanalysis is--right?--that

00:17:42.865 --> 00:17:46.460
you do not solve the problem for
the patient.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.950
The patient has to find its own
solution.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:55.118
The psychoanalysis will know
what the problem is eventually,

00:17:55.118 --> 00:17:58.348
will lead you there,
bring it from the subconscious

00:17:58.348 --> 00:18:01.020
into the conscious,
and then it is,

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:05.103
as it becomes conscious,
you suddenly realize you can

00:18:05.103 --> 00:18:06.058
deal with it.
 

00:18:06.058 --> 00:18:11.359
Now about the later work,
just very briefly;

00:18:11.359 --> 00:18:13.170
it's voluminous.
 

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.077
In 1899 he published a book
which is called

00:18:18.077 --> 00:18:22.048
Interpretation of Dreams.
 

00:18:22.048 --> 00:18:27.461
And it's to a large extent his
analysis of his own dreams,

00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:31.828
but also the dreams of some of
his patients.

00:18:31.828 --> 00:18:36.096
His father just passed away,
and with the death of the

00:18:36.096 --> 00:18:40.605
father he had a great deal of
guilt, why he had this hate

00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:42.700
feeling of his father.
 

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.727
It was a hate/love
relationship,

00:18:45.727 --> 00:18:48.950
but strongly motivated by hate.
 

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:54.980
And he began to analyze himself
and trying to figure out what

00:18:54.980 --> 00:19:00.394
his problem with his father was,
and what his relationship with

00:19:00.394 --> 00:19:02.098
the mother and father was.
 

00:19:02.098 --> 00:19:05.174
And Interpretation of
Dreams is a very important

00:19:05.174 --> 00:19:06.598
step in this direction.
 

00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:10.712
And the fundamental idea in
this path-breaking book,

00:19:10.712 --> 00:19:14.019
that in fact dreams are not
accidental.

00:19:14.019 --> 00:19:18.142
Dreams are the time of this
little window of opportunity

00:19:18.142 --> 00:19:22.565
when some of the stuff from the
unconscious tries to come up

00:19:22.565 --> 00:19:24.288
into the conscious.
 

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:27.768
So therefore what he did,
he made people to remember

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:31.265
their dreams,
and then he tried to help them,

00:19:31.265 --> 00:19:35.298
from the material which was
surfacing from dreams,

00:19:35.298 --> 00:19:39.029
to understand their
subconscious.

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:44.980
In 1905 there is another major
breakthrough.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:49.362
He's publishing The
Pathology of Everyday Life

00:19:49.362 --> 00:19:54.250
in which--you all know this
term--the Freudian slippage;

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:56.669
when somebody,
just by accident,

00:19:56.669 --> 00:20:00.180
got something wrong,
slips his tongue and says

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.380
something differently than it
should.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.469
Freud does show that very often
it's actually also the

00:20:08.469 --> 00:20:11.828
subconscious putting his head
up;

00:20:11.828 --> 00:20:15.013
and it's an indication what is
in your subconscious,

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.700
what is repressed in you.
 

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.142
It was just not an error what
you did.

00:20:19.142 --> 00:20:19.670
Right?
 

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.940
Beyond these errors he can see
the subconscious coming up.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.423
And then, of course,
the same year another major

00:20:27.423 --> 00:20:30.990
breakthrough--
probably next to the discovery

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.653
of psychoanalysis,
the most important

00:20:33.653 --> 00:20:36.756
breakthrough--the "Three
Essays on the Theory of

00:20:36.756 --> 00:20:37.890
Sexuality".
 

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:44.026
And now he is moving towards
what some will say--call a

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:48.798
pan-sexualist understanding of
the mind.

00:20:48.798 --> 00:20:53.048
Well it's probably pushing it
too far;

00:20:53.048 --> 00:20:55.618
most who are do not believe in
Freud.

00:20:55.618 --> 00:20:58.805
But there are still many,
many people who do believe in

00:20:58.805 --> 00:20:59.159
Freud.
 

00:20:59.159 --> 00:20:59.690
Right?
 

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:02.250
There are people who practice
psychoanalysis.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:06.127
You know, just ten,
twenty years ago,

00:21:06.127 --> 00:21:08.930
everybody has his analyst.
 

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:09.900
Right?
 

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.855
Interestingly,
I think somehow this is a

00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.358
little going out of fashion.
 

00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:16.019
But I think there are still
people--

00:21:16.019 --> 00:21:18.049
you must know
people--right?--who have their

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:20.950
analyst--
right?--and they go every other

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.709
week to the analyst,
lay down on the couch and they

00:21:24.709 --> 00:21:27.354
speak their mind,
and then they're kind of

00:21:27.354 --> 00:21:27.910
relieved.
 

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:32.154
Well I would say if you have
problems of depression,

00:21:32.154 --> 00:21:34.068
why don't you try it?
 

00:21:34.068 --> 00:21:39.692
Actually I think it certainly
does you less damage than taking

00:21:39.692 --> 00:21:42.643
these bloody pills,
what can--no,

00:21:42.643 --> 00:21:47.529
not that psychoanalysis cannot
cause you trouble.

00:21:47.529 --> 00:21:50.858
Because these psychoanalysts,
of course,

00:21:50.858 --> 00:21:55.200
all know because of Freud's
theory of sexuality,

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:02.608
that all these problems in us
is depressed sexual desires,

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:05.175
and everything has to do
something with our early

00:22:05.175 --> 00:22:10.419
childhood experiences;
for boys, with the love of your

00:22:10.419 --> 00:22:17.569
mother, and jealousy of your
father and--right?--and with

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:21.528
girls, the other way around.
 

00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:25.154
Well so if you go to an
analyst, in no time you will

00:22:25.154 --> 00:22:29.278
start figuring out why you
really, really hate your father,

00:22:29.278 --> 00:22:31.269
or you hate your mother.
 

00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:36.420
And well I'm not so sure that's
the best thing what can happen

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.180
to you.
 

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.150
But anyway, that's what he was
doing.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:44.855
And he--in fact,
he discovers I think an

00:22:44.855 --> 00:22:49.037
intriguing idea--
and I think psychologists to

00:22:49.037 --> 00:22:54.180
this day are struggling with it,
how much truth there is to it--

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.029
the so-called Oedipus complex.
 

00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:59.440
And you know what the Oedipus
complex is.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.538
King Oedipus,
by accident,

00:23:01.538 --> 00:23:05.987
marries his own wife--own
mother--and it turns out own

00:23:05.987 --> 00:23:09.511
mother--and that's of course a
big tragedy.

00:23:09.511 --> 00:23:10.519
Right?
 

00:23:10.519 --> 00:23:16.356
You are not supposed to--this
is incest, which is--virtually

00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:19.920
all civilizations prohibit
incest.

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:27.559
Well, and this is Oedipus
complex, that we are always in

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:33.256
love with our parents of the
opposite sex,

00:23:33.256 --> 00:23:37.561
and jealous of the other
parent.

00:23:37.561 --> 00:23:39.230
Right?
 

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:43.413
And the Oedipus complex also
means that we have a desire to

00:23:43.413 --> 00:23:46.660
kill our father in order to have
the love--

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:50.000
in fact, sexual love--of our
mother,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.298
if we are boys,
and vice-versa for girls.

00:23:52.298 --> 00:23:56.990
Well I think everybody would
agree this probably pushed the

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.105
idea a bit too far,
but there is clearly an

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.173
interesting--
a very important insight in the

00:24:03.173 --> 00:24:03.900
argument.
 

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.909
Then, in the later work,
he is moving more towards

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:09.298
metapsychology.
 

00:24:09.298 --> 00:24:13.385
Now he tries to explain the
functioning of society,

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:16.410
rather than just individual
psyche.

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:20.277
The first major step in this
direction is 1913,

00:24:20.277 --> 00:24:24.650
when he published the book
Totem and Taboo.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.544
And this is about the origins
of a fairly primitive

00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:33.374
society--the transformation from
a kinship network to a tribal,

00:24:33.374 --> 00:24:35.400
larger tribal society.
 

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:41.191
And he explains in this book
the origins of first complex

00:24:41.191 --> 00:24:46.981
society as the brothers come
together and they kill their

00:24:46.981 --> 00:24:48.118
father.
 

00:24:48.118 --> 00:24:53.616
And the father exercised in the
kinship relationship absolute

00:24:53.616 --> 00:24:54.348
power.
 

00:24:54.348 --> 00:24:57.469
And in fact he also believed
that in these early

00:24:57.469 --> 00:25:01.318
kinship-based societies,
there was even no incest taboo.

00:25:01.318 --> 00:25:07.788
So the father actually could
have sex with his daughters as

00:25:07.788 --> 00:25:08.568
well.
 

00:25:08.568 --> 00:25:12.075
Now the brothers come together,
they kill the father,

00:25:12.075 --> 00:25:14.838
and they create the first
civilization.

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:22.144
They're beginning to repress
desires and share power among

00:25:22.144 --> 00:25:23.809
themselves.
 

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:26.650
That's Totem and Taboo.
 

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:32.160
Then he writes two important
conceptual pieces,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.769
"Beyond the Pleasure
Principle",

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:36.058
1920, and "Ego and
Id".

00:25:36.058 --> 00:25:40.596
And I asked you to read some of
it, 1923, which are kind of

00:25:40.596 --> 00:25:43.098
important conceptual elements.
 

00:25:43.098 --> 00:25:48.082
And I think this all cumulated
in his Civilization and its

00:25:48.082 --> 00:25:51.288
Discontents,
1930, which arguably,

00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:55.711
if you are not interested in
individual psychology but the

00:25:55.711 --> 00:25:59.630
theory of society,
this is his most important book.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.900
It was a very big success and
has not been out of print ever

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:04.480
since.
 

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.430
'38, he has to leave Vienna.
 

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.644
He had a similar hate/love
relationship to the city of

00:26:12.644 --> 00:26:16.700
Vienna as towards his father,
as many people did.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:21.038
But by '38, the Nazis took it
over.

00:26:21.038 --> 00:26:26.078
Gestapo actually interviewed
his daughter,

00:26:26.078 --> 00:26:31.609
beloved daughter,
Anna, and sort of he saw the

00:26:31.609 --> 00:26:34.559
writing on the wall.
 

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:36.861
It's time to leave;
if you are Jewish,

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:39.348
you don't want to live in the
Third Reich.

00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:42.862
And he moves to London,
and just a year later he

00:26:42.862 --> 00:26:44.880
actually commits suicide.
 

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.900
It is an assisted suicide.
 

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.422
His doctor helped him to get
rid of the pain he was

00:26:52.422 --> 00:26:55.950
struggling with for a very long
time.

00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:00.250
Well, a bit about the
psychoanalytic movement.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.009
Freud's ideas were,
of course, outrageous ideas,

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:05.690
very controversial.
 

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:10.038
Nevertheless very early on,
already in 1902,

00:27:10.038 --> 00:27:13.500
there were a group of very
young and able people,

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:18.237
which included people like
Sandor Ferenczi and Carl Jung

00:27:18.237 --> 00:27:23.808
and Ernest Jones,
who wrote a wonderful biography

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:26.423
of--
the definite biography--of

00:27:26.423 --> 00:27:26.960
Freud.
 

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:31.297
If you want,
of course, a very pro-Freudian

00:27:31.297 --> 00:27:36.769
perspective, but read it,
it's a great book indeed.

00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:40.047
And they start together,
in Bergstrasse 19,

00:27:40.047 --> 00:27:42.308
in Vienna, every Wednesday.
 

00:27:42.308 --> 00:27:45.440
This was called the Wednesday
Psychological Circle.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.609
Then in 1908 this becomes the
Vienna Psychological Society--a

00:27:50.609 --> 00:27:55.779
bit of a misnomer because in no
time it's beginning to spread

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:57.588
around the world.
 

00:27:57.588 --> 00:28:01.630
And there are psychoanalytic
societies all over the world,

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:03.190
until this very day.
 

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:07.867
And if you want to become an
analyst, it's not enough to have

00:28:07.867 --> 00:28:11.973
a medical degree;
you have to go through years of

00:28:11.973 --> 00:28:16.038
very rigorous training,
what these psychoanalytic

00:28:16.038 --> 00:28:18.240
societies will monitor.
 

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:23.788
Freud was also a very difficult
person to get along.

00:28:23.788 --> 00:28:29.088
He basically had fallouts with
everybody.

00:28:29.088 --> 00:28:32.538
First, probably the most
important of his early

00:28:32.538 --> 00:28:37.250
associates, Adler;
already in 1911 they break up.

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:40.980
Then with Jung.
 

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:43.707
Adler, Jung;
next to Adler are the dominant

00:28:43.707 --> 00:28:47.900
figures of psychology in the
first two or three decades of

00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.740
the twentieth century.
 

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.896
Then even later on he breaks
with Ferenczi,

00:28:52.896 --> 00:28:57.106
who was a pretty loyal guy,
was not easy to get a fallout

00:28:57.106 --> 00:29:00.190
with him, but Freud managed this
one.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.259
He could make enemies
everywhere.

00:29:02.259 --> 00:29:10.951
Okay, then really the person
who was running the show became

00:29:10.951 --> 00:29:16.596
his daughter,
Anna Freud, who lived a long

00:29:16.596 --> 00:29:22.465
life and held up the torch and
carried the cause of

00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:24.578
psychoanalysis.
 

00:29:24.578 --> 00:29:28.807
So let me have a look at the
book on The

00:29:28.807 --> 00:29:33.126
Ego--not Ergo,
I'm sorry, it's The

00:29:33.126 --> 00:29:35.148
Ego and the Id.
 

00:29:35.148 --> 00:29:36.160
Right?
 

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.960
This is a Freudian slippage,
right?

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.759
&gt;
 

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:45.420
I have to correct this one.
 

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.758
Well there are,
he said--here is beginning to

00:29:48.758 --> 00:29:49.288
move.
 

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:54.242
The initial idea is there is
subconscious or unconscious and

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:59.029
conscious elements what
constitute the human sexuality.

00:29:59.029 --> 00:30:02.496
And now he wants to have a
clearer conceptual apparatus to

00:30:02.496 --> 00:30:03.528
deal with this.
 

00:30:03.528 --> 00:30:08.568
And he has, well our perception
system has three components.

00:30:08.568 --> 00:30:12.075
One is the ego,
the other one is id,

00:30:12.075 --> 00:30:15.278
and the third one is superego.
 

00:30:15.278 --> 00:30:18.604
And we will deal with all of
this.

00:30:18.604 --> 00:30:19.410
Right?
 

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:22.068
And therefore what is
interesting, what is the

00:30:22.068 --> 00:30:24.608
interaction between ego,
id and superego.

00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:27.795
And Discontents and
Civilization deals with this

00:30:27.795 --> 00:30:28.680
a great deal.
 

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.796
He's also talking about the two
classes of instincts,

00:30:32.796 --> 00:30:36.436
what guides life,
and that's also important for

00:30:36.436 --> 00:30:39.920
Civilization and its
Discontents.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.281
Well he said initially we made
a distinction between the

00:30:44.281 --> 00:30:46.818
conscious and the unconscious.
 

00:30:46.818 --> 00:30:51.294
And the idea of unconscious
came from the theory of

00:30:51.294 --> 00:30:56.215
repression, that we have
unconscious because some of the

00:30:56.215 --> 00:31:00.219
experiences we do not recall;
for instance,

00:31:00.219 --> 00:31:04.902
our sexual desire towards our
mother, which was prohibited,

00:31:04.902 --> 00:31:07.890
it's pushed into our
subconscious;

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:11.642
and other unpleasant
experiences in our life we want

00:31:11.642 --> 00:31:14.660
to forget and we put into
subconscious.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:16.150
That's repression.
 

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.480
We repress undesired experience.
 

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.057
Here
unconscious--right?--coincided

00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:29.738
with what is latent and what
wants to become conscious,

00:31:29.738 --> 00:31:33.210
wants to enter the conscious.
 

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.752
It's only suppressed,
and it is psychoanalysis which

00:31:36.752 --> 00:31:39.880
helps you to bring this into
consciousness.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.106
But he said,
"well all that is

00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:46.240
repressed is unconscious."
 

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.490
That's quite true.
 

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:49.298
You know?
 

00:31:49.298 --> 00:31:53.285
If you had bad memories,
you tend to forget it and put

00:31:53.285 --> 00:31:55.240
it into the unconscious.
 

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:01.009
But--the big discovery was--but
not all that is unconscious is

00:32:01.009 --> 00:32:03.278
necessarily repressed.
 

00:32:03.278 --> 00:32:07.079
There are stuff in the
unconscious which was there

00:32:07.079 --> 00:32:09.640
before it was in consciousness.
 

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:13.800
He said the later,
which is unconscious only

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.865
descriptively,
not dynamically--dynamically

00:32:17.865 --> 00:32:20.480
meant it was depressed.
 

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:24.575
But there is an element of
subconscious which is there only

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.564
descriptively.
 

00:32:25.564 --> 00:32:26.200
Right?
 

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.288
This is what he called
preconsciousness;

00:32:29.288 --> 00:32:32.914
before--it was never in the
conscious.

00:32:32.914 --> 00:32:33.700
Right?
 

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.009
It is just deep down in you.
 

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:41.288
And well and he said,
"We restrict the term

00:32:41.288 --> 00:32:45.659
unconscious to the
dynamically unconscious

00:32:45.659 --> 00:32:47.480
repressed."
 

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:51.397
And now the two,
this repressed unconscious and

00:32:51.397 --> 00:32:54.976
the preconscious,
together will constitute,

00:32:54.976 --> 00:32:56.848
I suppose, the id.
 

00:32:56.848 --> 00:33:03.368
Now we can now turn,
have different concepts now,

00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:08.528
Freud said, conscious,
preconscious and unconscious,

00:33:08.528 --> 00:33:13.079
and the question is what is the
relationship between those?

00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:14.480
So what is ego?
 

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.880
He said, "Each individual,
there is a coherent

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:23.632
organization of the mental
process, and this is what we

00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:24.952
call ego."
 

00:33:24.952 --> 00:33:25.920
Right?
 

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:33.250
Well it is to this ego that
consciousness is attached.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.338
What is consciousness in us is
what is ego.

00:33:37.338 --> 00:33:40.230
He said, "It is also a
mental agency"--

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:45.692
right?--"which supervises
and constitutes the process of

00:33:45.692 --> 00:33:49.654
thinking";
he said, "which goes to

00:33:49.654 --> 00:33:54.488
sleep, but, at the same time,
exercises control even over

00:33:54.488 --> 00:33:56.299
your dreams."
 

00:33:56.299 --> 00:33:57.838
That's your ego.
 

00:33:57.838 --> 00:34:03.509
And the ego is the agents of
repression.

00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:07.707
The ego will repress stuff
which is in the way of the ego

00:34:07.707 --> 00:34:11.380
to act, that will push it into
the unconscious.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.864
Well he said,
"Therefore our therapy was

00:34:15.864 --> 00:34:21.880
to try to bring into the ego
what was unconscious"--

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.159
right?--"and what was
repressed."

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:29.739
But there is something else
which is not repressed,

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:35.654
which also has a very important
drive, and this is id.

00:34:35.654 --> 00:34:36.768
Right?
 

00:34:36.768 --> 00:34:41.512
Id is what is deeply down in
your--those desires,

00:34:41.512 --> 00:34:44.969
the drives which come out of
you.

00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:48.831
And they are not-- some of it
is not, has never been

00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:49.739
repressed.
 

00:34:49.739 --> 00:34:54.610
It is just by nature in you,
for instance sexual drives.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.320
Right?
 

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.889
"So I propose to call the
entity,

00:34:58.889 --> 00:35:03.797
which starts out from the
system preconscious and begins

00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:08.168
by the preconscious,
the ego, and call the other

00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:11.927
part of the mind,
into which this entity extends

00:35:11.927 --> 00:35:15.969
and which behaves through it as
if it were unconscious,

00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:17.079
the id."
 

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:20.400
It's unconscious but not
repressed;

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.820
or a combination of repressed
and preconscious.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:31.202
Well he said,
"The ego is very sharply

00:35:31.202 --> 00:35:34.849
separated from the id.
 

00:35:34.849 --> 00:35:41.199
It's really the id is below the
ego."

00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:44.400
And that's a very--this is
probably the best to grasp,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.240
what he said:
"The ego's relationship to

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:52.170
the id is like a man on a
horseback"--

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.711
right?--"after the rider
is obliged to guide the horse

00:35:56.711 --> 00:36:00.079
where the horse wants to
go." Right?

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.650
This is the id. Right?
 

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:07.860
So the ego will be on the
horse--the horse is the id--

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:10.889
but occasionally if you don't
want to follow the horse,

00:36:10.889 --> 00:36:13.152
you let the horse go where the
horse wants to go.

00:36:13.152 --> 00:36:13.530
Right?
 

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:17.159
You try to control the horse,
but there is so much you can

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.559
do, about the horse.
 

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:22.380
It's a very important idea in
mature Freud.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.085
And then there comes the
superego.

00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:24.500
Right?
 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.025
He said, "The ego is not
merely a part of the id."

00:36:29.025 --> 00:36:29.639
Right?
 

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:36.030
"There also exists a grade
in the ego which may be called

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.802
the ego-ideal,
or the superego."

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:40.849
Right?
 

00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:46.759
And the part of this ego is
firmly connected to the

00:36:46.759 --> 00:36:48.650
consciousness.
 

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:52.590
 
 

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.530
And well the
superego--right?--is the,

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:05.865
he said, "is part residue
of earlier object choices of the

00:37:05.865 --> 00:37:09.400
id,
but it represents an energetic

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:13.610
reaction formation against those
choices."

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:18.119
It is what tells you what you
should be, not what you are.

00:37:18.119 --> 00:37:20.438
The ego tells you who you are.
 

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:20.980
Right?
 

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:25.577
The ego tests the world of
reality and tests what you can

00:37:25.577 --> 00:37:28.778
achieve under the conditions of
reality.

00:37:28.778 --> 00:37:29.599
Right?
 

00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:34.110
The superego is that part of
your consciousness which

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:38.101
actually will tell you that what
you should be.

00:37:38.101 --> 00:37:38.969
Right?
 

00:37:38.969 --> 00:37:42.876
Adam Smith, you remember Adam
Smith, the theory of moral

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:43.730
sentiment.
 

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:47.387
There is somebody inside of you
who is watching you and makes a

00:37:47.387 --> 00:37:50.280
judgment on you whether this is
right or wrong.

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:57.916
The idea of superego is very
similar--right?--to this Adam

00:37:57.916 --> 00:38:00.059
Smithian idea.
 

00:38:00.059 --> 00:38:03.900
Well psychoanalysis,
he said, was criticized for

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.476
ignoring the higher values in
human life and talking only

00:38:08.476 --> 00:38:11.500
about sex and so on and so
forth.

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.949
He said, "This is all
wrong;

00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:16.880
we are very aware of the
existence of the superego.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:21.610
And there is a complex
interaction between ego,

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:24.079
id and superego."
 

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:29.949
Well the ego is essentially
repressive.

00:38:29.949 --> 00:38:33.679
It essentially represents the
external reality,

00:38:33.679 --> 00:38:36.030
the external world as such.
 

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.782
The superego,
on the other hand,

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:41.527
represents the internal world,
your own view what you would

00:38:41.527 --> 00:38:43.925
want to be,
though you cannot be,

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:46.980
partially because your drives
are dirty--

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:53.192
right?--and your ego does not
let you to achieve that.

00:38:53.192 --> 00:38:54.130
Right?
 

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.918
So actually what belonged to
the lowest part of the mental

00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:01.255
life--
right?--this suppressed stuff,

00:39:01.255 --> 00:39:06.400
is turned into what is the
highest in the human mind--

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.130
right?--the superego.
 

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.530
Well there are also two classes
of instincts.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.009
One instinct,
what he discovered early in the

00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:16.389
work,
is what he calls

00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:23.025
libido--right?--the sexual
desire and the desire to live

00:39:23.025 --> 00:39:27.489
and survive and
self-preservation.

00:39:27.489 --> 00:39:29.369
But there is another instinct
in us;

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:34.192
he discovers it somewhat later
in life, and this is the death

00:39:34.192 --> 00:39:35.880
instinct, Thanatos.
 

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.409
So there are Eros and Thanatos.
 

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.420
One is what makes us live.
 

00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.860
The other is destructive,
wants to bring us to death.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:50.458
And the human life and the
human history can be understood

00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:54.681
as a struggle between the Eros
and Thanatos,

00:39:54.681 --> 00:39:55.860
as such.
 

00:39:55.860 --> 00:40:03.300
Sadism is a good example of
Thanatos, he said.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.467
Okay, let me move to
Civilization and

00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:07.929
Discontents.
 

00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:12.117
And there are the major
highlights: about ego

00:40:12.117 --> 00:40:16.400
development, religion and
purposes of life.

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:23.599
Civilization as restriction of
sexual life.

00:40:23.599 --> 00:40:25.929
About ego development.
 

00:40:25.929 --> 00:40:32.518
There is not that much I have
to add or interpret here.

00:40:32.518 --> 00:40:37.429
Well he said the ego eventually
evolves in us;

00:40:37.429 --> 00:40:39.768
it's not just given in us.
 

00:40:39.768 --> 00:40:40.400
Right?
 

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:43.340
It's sharply differentiated.
 

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.079
I can say, "This person
has a strong ego."

00:40:46.079 --> 00:40:52.003
You present your ego very
strongly, and your id is being

00:40:52.003 --> 00:40:56.204
hidden from, if I can put it
with Erving

00:40:56.204 --> 00:41:01.590
Goffman,--right?--the id is in
the back stage.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:09.054
You don't show it--right?--the
id, but what you want to present

00:41:09.054 --> 00:41:10.739
is your ego.
 

00:41:10.739 --> 00:41:13.871
But this evolves
gradually--right?--in the

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.239
process of human development.
 

00:41:16.239 --> 00:41:21.851
You can see as ego gradually
develops in a child and takes

00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:23.820
the form as it is.
 

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:28.472
And one important process in
this, as you move away from the

00:41:28.472 --> 00:41:31.940
pleasure principles to the
reality principle.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:32.730
Right?
 

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.628
"Is there a purpose of
human life?",

00:41:34.628 --> 00:41:35.050
he asks.
 

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:39.184
"Well only religion can
answer, talk to you about the

00:41:39.184 --> 00:41:40.489
purpose of life.
 

00:41:40.489 --> 00:41:44.396
I, as a psychologist or a
social analyst or social

00:41:44.396 --> 00:41:48.543
scientist, I cannot tell you
what the purpose of life

00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:49.579
is."
 

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:51.480
What is the purpose of life now?
 

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.269
He comes very close to the
utilitarian idea.

00:41:54.269 --> 00:41:54.789
Right?
 

00:41:54.789 --> 00:42:00.820
We almost hear John Stuart Mill
speaking to him.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.195
Happiness; we are all striving
to be happy.

00:42:04.195 --> 00:42:04.840
Right?
 

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:10.228
But unfortunately the problem
is it is much easier to be

00:42:10.228 --> 00:42:12.677
unhappy than to be happy.
 

00:42:12.677 --> 00:42:13.559
Right?
 

00:42:13.559 --> 00:42:18.670
And, because we are confronted
with the problems,

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:24.847
that in fact unhappiness is
much likely to be our fate than

00:42:24.847 --> 00:42:29.320
achieve what we want to be,
happiness.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:34.356
This pleasure principle is
transformed into a reality

00:42:34.356 --> 00:42:35.518
principle.
 

00:42:35.518 --> 00:42:39.326
We say, "Well,
that is the reality what we

00:42:39.326 --> 00:42:41.230
have to accept."
 

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:42.980
And we have to escape this.
 

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.230
We need to have this reality
principle to bring our

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.610
unhappiness under control.
 

00:42:49.610 --> 00:42:53.322
To be able to survive the
sufferings, we have to have a

00:42:53.322 --> 00:42:54.630
sense of reality.
 

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:57.550
And this is the taming of the
ego.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:03.965
This now becomes very close to
Nietzsche, as close as Freud

00:43:03.965 --> 00:43:05.403
ever will be.
 

00:43:05.403 --> 00:43:06.400
Right?
 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.829
And the sublimation of
instincts--that's all what

00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:11.686
civilization is all about.
 

00:43:11.686 --> 00:43:12.329
Right?
 

00:43:12.329 --> 00:43:17.951
The feeling of happiness is
derived from the satisfaction of

00:43:17.951 --> 00:43:22.619
wild intellectual impulses,
untamed by the ego.

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:26.927
The blond beast--right?--that's
where the real pleasure comes

00:43:26.927 --> 00:43:27.429
from.
 

00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:30.679
But it has to be tamed. Right?
 

00:43:30.679 --> 00:43:32.139
Here it comes. Right?
 

00:43:32.139 --> 00:43:33.929
Very much the Nietzschean idea.
 

00:43:33.929 --> 00:43:40.675
And this is happening through
the--if you want to escape it,

00:43:40.675 --> 00:43:44.447
then you do it,
you become maniac,

00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:46.619
or intoxicated.
 

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:53.672
If you cannot face the reality,
then you drink.

00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:54.900
Right?
 

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:58.101
It was too much,
so I go to the pub and I order

00:43:58.101 --> 00:44:00.954
a double scotch--right?--and
then I relax.

00:44:00.954 --> 00:44:01.650
Right?
 

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:05.920
Intoxication is the way how to
avoid reality;

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:07.280
I get drunk.
 

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.929
Many people get drunk.
 

00:44:09.929 --> 00:44:13.800
A very bad idea because
actually it will make it worse.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.784
Your unhappiness,
as soon as the first few

00:44:17.784 --> 00:44:22.739
minutes of happiness is past,
will be just worse.

00:44:22.739 --> 00:44:27.829
Well, and another way to do it
is sublimation--

00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:32.001
right?--of the instinct--to
suppress and ennoble in some

00:44:32.001 --> 00:44:37.202
ways these instincts that were--
actually you move into the

00:44:37.202 --> 00:44:41.942
sphere of fantasies;
you fantasize rather than live

00:44:41.942 --> 00:44:44.389
out your depressed desires.
 

00:44:44.389 --> 00:44:48.407
And this is the mechanism of
fantasy, which creates art and

00:44:48.407 --> 00:44:51.130
science;
and the most noble human

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:54.940
activities are actually
sublimated unsatisfied

00:44:54.940 --> 00:45:00.190
desires--right?--which came from
the ego--came from the id;

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:05.806
the ego confronted with reality
and then suppressed it,

00:45:05.806 --> 00:45:11.320
and then was sublimated into
these higher elements.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.362
Well he has a very nice
quotation from Goethe on an

00:45:16.362 --> 00:45:20.096
unpublished poem,
and not surprisingly

00:45:20.096 --> 00:45:21.710
unpublished.
 

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:32.369
This says: "The people who
have science and art also do

00:45:32.369 --> 00:45:35.260
have religion.
 

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.989
Those who do not have either
science or art have to have

00:45:40.989 --> 00:45:42.760
religion."
 

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.679
Well it's a very interesting
idea.

00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:49.534
In fact, I don't think it is
totally obvious how you have to

00:45:49.534 --> 00:45:52.989
interpret it,
especially the first part.

00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:57.717
I think there's a way one can
interpret the first sentence:

00:45:57.717 --> 00:46:02.768
Wer Wissenschaft und Kunst
Besitzt hat auch Religion.

00:46:02.768 --> 00:46:06.215
It basically means well,
you know, science and art is a

00:46:06.215 --> 00:46:09.023
sort of a religion,
and if you are actually a

00:46:09.023 --> 00:46:12.280
scientist or an artist,
you have your religion;

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.768
you even don't have to be
religious.

00:46:14.768 --> 00:46:18.748
But if you have no science or
no art, in order to make sense

00:46:18.748 --> 00:46:20.771
of the life you need religion.
 

00:46:20.771 --> 00:46:21.380
Right?
 

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:26.188
And that's--I think it's not
surprising that he never

00:46:26.188 --> 00:46:28.130
published the poem.
 

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.159
Well Freud pushes far.
 

00:46:31.159 --> 00:46:35.514
He's also anti-religious,
and he said well indeed

00:46:35.514 --> 00:46:40.619
religion is just mass delusion,
because it does create the

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:44.233
impression--
right?--that you can actually

00:46:44.233 --> 00:46:47.021
mold reality;
that there is purpose of

00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:51.106
life--probably not on this earth
but beyond that--and you will be

00:46:51.106 --> 00:46:52.639
able to achieve that.
 

00:46:52.639 --> 00:46:55.170
That's why he calls it 'mass
delusion'.

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.931
You don't confront reality.
 

00:46:56.931 --> 00:46:57.389
Right?
 

00:46:57.389 --> 00:47:04.610
You do not develop your reality
principle sufficiently.

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:08.739
And, of course,
he also calls this infantile;

00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:12.284
infantile because you create
the figure of the god,

00:47:12.284 --> 00:47:13.489
the father god.
 

00:47:13.489 --> 00:47:17.760
And he said this is exactly the
young infant's reaction how to

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.476
respond to danger,
and the reality,

00:47:20.476 --> 00:47:24.840
to hope that you will get
protections from your father.

00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.230
And he said this is exactly
what religions are calling upon.

00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:32.525
My--you know,
when you address God as

00:47:32.525 --> 00:47:35.389
"My Father."
 

00:47:35.389 --> 00:47:41.389
Okay, there are different
sources of unhappiness.

00:47:41.389 --> 00:47:45.262
First of all the nature is a
source of our unhappiness--is

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:46.010
superior.
 

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:49.293
And one part of nature is
particularly a source of

00:47:49.293 --> 00:47:51.170
unhappiness: our own body.
 

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.463
And, you know,
if you are getting sick and

00:47:53.463 --> 00:47:56.146
old, like Freud did,
you will appreciate more and

00:47:56.146 --> 00:47:59.000
more how much unhappiness comes
from your body;

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.521
what you don't necessarily feel
right now, but wait fifty more

00:48:03.521 --> 00:48:05.079
years and you will.
 

00:48:05.079 --> 00:48:09.722
Okay, and there is--the biggest
unhappiness actually comes from

00:48:09.722 --> 00:48:11.070
human relations.
 

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:16.775
It's again something which
resembles very much the young

00:48:16.775 --> 00:48:21.545
Marx--alienation,
as alienated from your fellow

00:48:21.545 --> 00:48:23.309
human beings.
 

00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:26.202
And, of course,
very much to

00:48:26.202 --> 00:48:32.630
Nietzsche--right?--that the
problem is in human relations.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:38.313
Well now the question is how on
earth we can solve this problem

00:48:38.313 --> 00:48:40.239
of human relations?
 

00:48:40.239 --> 00:48:44.545
And because we have this big
problem--right?--in human

00:48:44.545 --> 00:48:48.121
relations, people start blaming
civilization,

00:48:48.121 --> 00:48:49.989
like Nietzsche did.
 

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:55.217
And well but he said it is,
in fact, conceivable that man

00:48:55.217 --> 00:48:59.045
in earlier ages,
rather than in modernity,

00:48:59.045 --> 00:49:03.340
actually were happier than they
are today.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.297
Well yes, noble
savages--right?--the happiness

00:49:06.297 --> 00:49:08.599
in the state of nature,
Rousseau.

00:49:08.599 --> 00:49:12.530
He said, "Well that's not
an unreasonable argument."

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.268
But how does civilization
develop?

00:49:15.268 --> 00:49:20.132
Well he said--suggests,
he's proceeding towards more

00:49:20.132 --> 00:49:24.329
and more control over the
external world,

00:49:24.329 --> 00:49:28.369
but also towards extension of
the number of people included in

00:49:28.369 --> 00:49:31.778
the community;
therefore more and more control

00:49:31.778 --> 00:49:33.143
over other people.
 

00:49:33.143 --> 00:49:33.750
Right?
 

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:36.887
This is sort of civilization is
a technology,

00:49:36.887 --> 00:49:39.739
how to be able to control more
people;

00:49:39.739 --> 00:49:43.630
control nature and more people.
 

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:47.300
Yes, we already talked about
Totem and Taboo.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.429
You will see these on the
internet.

00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:54.179
Anyway, all culture,
all civilizations,

00:49:54.179 --> 00:49:56.280
are coming from repression.
 

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:58.650
And this is a very important
insight;

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:03.980
very similar to Nietzsche's
critique--right?--of morality.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:09.139
And in particular civilization
restricts sexual life.

00:50:09.139 --> 00:50:12.077
Well the important aim of
civilization,

00:50:12.077 --> 00:50:15.710
to bring many people together
into a society.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:21.443
And the limit of uninhabited
sexual love.

00:50:21.443 --> 00:50:22.590
Right?
 

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:26.090
It restricts sexual life.
 

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:29.744
He said this was--the high mark
was reached in Western European

00:50:29.744 --> 00:50:30.630
civilization.
 

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:35.079
It's again almost--you read
almost Nietzsche--right?--here.

00:50:35.079 --> 00:50:40.485
A choice of an object is
restricted to the opposite sex,

00:50:40.485 --> 00:50:45.594
and most extra-genital
satisfactions are forbidden as

00:50:45.594 --> 00:50:47.070
perversion.
 

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:52.960
But even heterosexual genital
love is restricted.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.710
Only sexual relationship,
on the basis of solitary,

00:50:56.710 --> 00:51:02.010
indissoluble bond between one
man and one woman is what is

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.360
accepted in Western
civilization,

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.440
not in other civilization.
 

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:13.067
And that is the most repressive
system of sexuality.

00:51:13.067 --> 00:51:13.949
Right?
 

00:51:13.949 --> 00:51:18.289
Well--right?
 

00:51:18.289 --> 00:51:21.793
And there is actually more to
it, rather than repression of

00:51:21.793 --> 00:51:22.519
sexuality.
 

00:51:22.519 --> 00:51:23.840
You know?
 

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:29.534
It has to restrict all other
kind of drives which is coming

00:51:29.534 --> 00:51:30.909
from the id.
 

00:51:30.909 --> 00:51:37.423
It teaches you--right?--to love
your neighbor and even your

00:51:37.423 --> 00:51:43.039
enemy, which is in his
view--right?--impossible.

00:51:43.039 --> 00:51:51.389
But well we have to control
somehow aggressivity.

00:51:51.389 --> 00:51:57.021
Homo homini lupus;
man is the wolf of man.

00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:57.960
Right?
 

00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:02.465
This is kind of Hobbesian
theory of human nature--deeply

00:52:02.465 --> 00:52:04.349
down we are actually.
 

00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:06.018
There is also a critique of
Marx.

00:52:06.018 --> 00:52:08.030
Marx thinks there is an easy
solution.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:11.693
You eliminate private ownership
and homo homini lupus

00:52:11.693 --> 00:52:12.750
will be solved.
 

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:15.909
He said this is naīve,
this does not happen.

00:52:15.909 --> 00:52:20.208
Well I don't have time to work
on this, though it's a very

00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:23.527
interesting idea:
Nazism, and why you dislike

00:52:23.527 --> 00:52:26.469
particularly which is close to
you.

00:52:26.469 --> 00:52:31.277
Well I think I'll probably just
have to leave this here,

00:52:31.277 --> 00:52:36.436
and just finish with the note
suggesting that he is actually

00:52:36.436 --> 00:52:38.010
very troubled.
 

00:52:38.010 --> 00:52:42.041
He shows the repressive nature
of civilization,

00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:47.213
but he does not want to buy
into the Nazi anti-civilization.

00:52:47.213 --> 00:52:48.090
Right?
 

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:51.422
And he said,
"Well I am not suggesting

00:52:51.422 --> 00:52:56.496
the superego is not necessary--
superego is necessary--but I'm

00:52:56.496 --> 00:53:00.672
concerned about the superego to
be tyrannical."

00:53:00.672 --> 00:53:01.409
Right?
 

00:53:01.409 --> 00:53:03.708
"And let's try to find a
middle

00:53:03.708 --> 00:53:07.650
way"--right?--"in
which let's not be naīve.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:12.911
The id gives bad impulses and
they have to be controlled by

00:53:12.911 --> 00:53:16.902
the superego,
but the superego can go too far

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:18.989
and too much."
 

00:53:18.989 --> 00:53:25.528
So kind of tries to walk a
narrow way between Marx and

00:53:25.528 --> 00:53:27.010
Nietzsche.
 

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:28.480
All right? Thank you.
 

00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:34.000

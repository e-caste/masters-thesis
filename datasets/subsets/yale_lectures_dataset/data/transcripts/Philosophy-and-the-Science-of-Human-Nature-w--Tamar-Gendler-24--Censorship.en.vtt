00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.860
PROFESSOR: So our topic today
is the general question of

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.620
what sort of non-rational
persuasion is legitimate for a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.190
government to engage in if we're
willing to accept the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.220
kind of social contract
argument that we were

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.990
considering in the last few
weeks of the course.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.350
So you'll recall that starting
with the account of justice

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.510
that's offered in Plato's
Republic, and continuing with

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.540
the account of the state of
nature that we get in Hobbes,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.390
each of our authors has
suggested that it is in our

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.690
self interest, in a way that we
would reflectively endorse

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.250
governmental structures, to give
up some of our freedoms

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.680
in order to guarantee a certain
sort of stability.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.910
But the sorts of constraints
that we considered in the

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.040
earlier discussions of this
concerned explicit laws.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.130
They concerned ways in which we
contract into regulations

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.169
that we recognize as holding
upon us, and that we endorse

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:20.660
because we see the rational
reason for

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.030
contracting into them.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.150
The argument that Hobbes makes
appeals to the notion of The

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.970
Prisoner's Dilemma, which is
a paradox of rationality.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.460
It's a problem that arises when
self interests conflict

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.550
in particular ways and interact
with incentives in

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.250
particular ways.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.410
What we looked at, at the end
of last lecture, and what

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.360
we'll look at in today's lecture
are the ways in which

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.350
human beings are complex.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.130
They have, as we know from our
early lectures, not only

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.330
reason but also parts of their
soul which are affected by

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.390
things other than reason.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.630
And that, too, turns out to
have implications for what

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.710
political structures
end up being

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.420
rational for us to endorse.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.370
In particular, what we'll look
at in today's lecture, is on

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.680
the one hand Plato's argument
that in the ideal state there

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.220
would be rather radical
censorship of what sort of

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.540
fictional representations were
permitted, and Cass Sunstein's

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.910
argument that one of the duties
of the government is to

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:47.090
establish norms that affect
people implicitly in how it is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.440
that they structure
their behavior.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.300
So in the context of a lecture
on this topic it seems

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.530
appropriate to begin with
a couple of stories.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.770
True stories about false stories
and their effects.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.450
So in 1992, right around the
time when many of you were

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.660
being born, there was also born
on television a young boy

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.530
who was born to a television
character named Murphy Brown.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.690
Now that's not in itself
newsworthy.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.560
What is newsworthy is
that Murphy Brown at

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.370
the time was unmarried.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.630
Indeed she didn't have
a long-term partner.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:40.890
And the then-Vice President of
the United States, Dan Quayle,

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.410
famously gave a speech in San
Francisco in 1992 at which he

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.820
said, "Marriage is a moral issue
that requires consensus

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.150
and the use of social
sanction.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.180
It doesn't help matters when
prime time television has

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.610
Murphy Brown, a character who
supposedly epitomizes today's

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.720
intelligent highly paid
professional woman, mocking

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.880
the importance of a father by
bearing a child alone and

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.300
calling it just another
lifestyle choice."

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.630
Now in fact Dan Quayle slightly
misrepresented what

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.830
happened on the show.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.940
Murphy Brown, though she lacked
a long-term partner and

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.710
did bear a child without the
support of a second adult

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.550
figure, didn't call it just
a lifestyle choice.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.690
But he was correct in that the
show did not go on to depict

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.490
in any way what the costs were
to Murphy Brown's life of

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.780
having to reconfigure her
life in a way that

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.840
she became a caregiver.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.930
What's interesting, of course,
is that this is a real person,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.410
Dan Quayle, the real Vice
President of the real country,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.850
the United States of America,
calling into question the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.010
imaginary birth of a child who
was not in fact the child of

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.490
the actress who played
Murphy Brown --

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.160
in such a way that he
saw it as eroding

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.040
values that are important.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.130
Moreover, this debate hit the
news in an extraordinary way.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.240
It was on the cover of Time.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.700
It was on the cover of the New
York Post. "Dan rips Murphy

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.770
Brown." The New York Daily News
said, "Quayle to Murphy

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.950
Brown: You Tramp!" The New York
Times ran an article some

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.070
months later when, in an act of
enormous post-modern irony,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.590
Murphy Brown the character on
television responded to Dan

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.090
Quayle the actual
Vice President.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.500
And the New York Times offered
an article that began with the

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.560
paragraph, "Almost everyone
who watches television is

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.780
aware that Murphy Brown responds
tonight to Vice

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.910
President Dan Quayle, who helped
push family values to

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.170
the forefront of the 1992
presidential campaign by

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.120
criticizing the show's leading
character last spring for

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.730
having a child out of
wedlock." That's

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.650
story number one.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.890
Here's story number two.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.370
A little more recently.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:31.890
In 2002 the television show 24
had depicting the President of

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:38.910
the United States a man
of African descent.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.210
In 2007 that same show depicted
the President of the

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.140
United States as a woman.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.720
In 2008, as all of you know, the
two leading candidates for

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.420
the presidential nomination in
the Democratic party were a

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.920
man of African descent
and a woman.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:12.640
And the commentators who look
at elections, were commonly

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:19.690
saying things like this blog
from Newsweek says.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:24.260
What it points out is that the
availability in fictional

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.640
representation of a character
who served as President and

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.970
was of African descent or who
served as President and was a

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:39.770
woman, played some role in
allowing actual citizens in

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.890
the real world--

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.820
not imaginary people on TV--

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:49.240
to have conceptual space
available for the possibility

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.590
of there being a President
of that kind.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:08:00.580
Now Dan Quayle and the
commentators speaking about 24

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.190
were, as you know from your
readings for today--

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:09.590
channeling our friend Plato.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.280
Dan Quayle essentially said,
if we want the guardians of

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.690
our city, that is the citizens
who are in a position to

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:21.050
govern and select leadership,
if we want the guardians of

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.520
our city to think that it's
shameful to be easily provoked

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.840
into hating another--

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.690
read: shameful to bear a
child out of wedlock--

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.200
"then we mustn't allow stories
about the gods," says Plato--

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.950
stories about attractive
characters on television says

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.420
Dan Quayle--

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:43.550
"warring or plotting against
one another." That is,

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.700
engaging in the activity
that we want to forbid.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.590
So when Plato says "if we want
the guardians of our city to

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.280
think that it's shameful to be
easily provoked into hating

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.940
one another, we mustn't allow
stories about gods warring or

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.500
plotting against one another,"
he's making an argument that

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.500
Dan Quayle picks up on
2000 years later.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.290
And to the extent that our
Newsweek commentators and

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.290
others in their discussion of
the 2008 presidential election

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:21.000
were pleased to see an opening
up of the range of candidates

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.700
who were being taken seriously
as potential leaders of this

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:30.040
nation, they too were channeling
Plato, who right

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:33.590
after the remark that we just
quoted, continues by saying,

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.600
"If we're to persuade our people
that no citizen has

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.960
ever hated one another and that
it's impious to do so,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:45.490
then that's what should be told
in our story." That is

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.710
stories, fictional
representations, imaginary

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:55.190
experiences that become part of
the cultural conversation

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.660
can provide role models
that are both

00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:01.820
problematic and inspiring.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.260
Now the puzzle that this raises
if we think only in

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:12.590
terms of rationality
is the following.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:17.030
How can something that we know
to be fictional affect our

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.350
actual behaviors
and attitudes?

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.760
It's not as if people watching
24 thought that David Palmer

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.100
was actually the president
of the United States.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:34.980
It's not that people watching
Murphy Brown thought that the

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.440
character played by
Candice Bergen had

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.090
actually had a child.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:44.150
People were profoundly aware
that these were fictional

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.990
representations.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:51.310
And even young children are
remarkably good at separating

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.020
pretense from reality.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:58.760
If you engage in an imaginary
tea party with a young child

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:04.410
where you pour imaginary tea
into a series of cups out of

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:09.610
an actually empty teapot, the
children are perfectly ready

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.240
to agree that the cups
are full in the

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.990
context of the pretense.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.500
But no child who is thirsty
thinks that you can actually

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:25.770
get something to drink lifting
one of those up and bringing

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:27.670
it to your mouth.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:31.990
If you engage in a game with a
child where you make cookies

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:39.730
out of Play Dough, children are
shocked and upset if you

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:44.540
actually try to bite into one.

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.850
And adults, too, have the
capacity to determine what's

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:54.280
merely imaginary and
what's actual.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:12:01.110
Well they have the capacity with
one part of their soul.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:05.860
The response to the puzzle
that gives rise to the

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.530
concerns that Plato and Dan
Quayle and our bloggers

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:16.490
articulate, is that the way that
fiction causes problems

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.430
is by affecting the non-rational
parts of the soul

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:25.340
in ways that are not easily
subject to rational regulation

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.360
or control.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.040
Now this structure is already
familiar to us from our

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.570
general discussions of
parts of the soul.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:39.460
We know from our lecture in
January that if I stand on a

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.120
glass surface above the Grand
Canyon and look down beneath

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:48.970
me and see the roaring Colorado
River, though my

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:54.080
rationality tells me that I am
safe, the non-rational parts

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.300
of my soul are affected by this
visual stimulus in a way

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.220
that causes me to tremble.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.100
And even if I tell you and
convince you that what looks

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:10.440
to be a box of kitty litter is
in fact a box containing

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:14.370
chocolate cake covered with
coconut and Tootsie Rolls,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:19.140
though the rational part of your
soul may believe me, it

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:24.730
has a rather difficult time
regulating the other parts.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.610
So too in the series of puzzles
that we looked at in

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:34.060
the context of the heuristics
and biases tradition.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.300
If I present you with a choice
where you're trying to get a

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:42.470
red ball between a bowl that
contains nine white balls and

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:47.210
one red one, or a bowl that
contains 92 white balls and 8

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.740
red ones, through the rational
part of your soul is

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:55.070
profoundly aware that you have
a 10% chance over here and an

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.080
8% chance over there, it is
nonetheless the case that if I

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.290
put you under cognitive load
in such a way that your

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:06.750
rational part isn't in a
position to make the decision,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:12.360
you will be drawn towards the
bowl with more rather than

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.040
towards the bowl with
a higher proportion.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.890
Reason isn't sufficient to
regulate the non-rational

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.660
parts of the soul.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:28.080
And again in the context of our
discussion of temptation,

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.030
of weakness of the will.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:32.220
Here's Ulysses tied
to the mast --

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.300
rationally committed to making
his way past the Sirens but

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.300
unable to do so without either
blocking his ears to prevent

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.740
himself from hearing the
temptation or tying himself to

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:51.230
the mast in such a way that
he's unable to act on it.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.870
Plato says roughly this when
he identifies what it is

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:59.710
that's so problematic about
fictional representations.

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:06.190
He says, "the imitative poet
appeals to a part of the soul

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.820
that is inferior." Recall
Plato has the hierarchy

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.700
reason, spirit, appetite.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.910
"He arouses, nourishes and
strengthens this part of the

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.060
soul and so destroys
the rational one.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:25.190
He puts a bad constitution in
the soul of each individual by

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:29.990
gratifying the irrational
part of the soul."

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:35.470
So the fact that we know
something to be fictional with

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:40.460
the reason part of our soul
isn't sufficient to prevent it

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:44.620
from affecting us
in other ways.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:51.220
In particular, Plato is worried
about three ways that

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.020
fiction can problematically
affect the soul.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.850
And, importantly, willing
to forgive a fourth.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:04.210
And looking through the details
of that will allow us

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:08.500
to get a better sense
of Plato's picture.

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:12.470
So what is it that Plato is
worried about when he's

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.770
worried about fiction's
capacity to affect the

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:18.550
non-rational parts
of the soul?

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.260
He's worried first of all about
that sort of thing that

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.710
Dan Quayle was worried about.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:28.260
That observing a particular
circumstance in a fictional

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:32.079
representation and then
reasoning about it as an

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:38.840
available way of life may lead
to mischosen role models.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:43.770
He's worried even more
profoundly when we observe

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:47.850
something in a fictional
context and because we

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.890
explicitly recognize it as
fictional, allow ourselves to

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.290
respond to it in a way different
than we would if it

00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:02.810
were actual but such that
it affects us profoundly

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:07.530
emotionally in a way that
changes our attitudes of

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:11.150
approval or disapproval.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.480
What he's not worried about--

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.420
and this will be crucial
to the larger

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.520
argument that I'm making--

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.740
is playful imitation.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.150
Cases where not just at the
level of rationality, but also

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:32.580
with regard to the parts of
our response system that

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:38.590
aren't subject to rational
regulation, we engage with the

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:42.960
material somehow
at a distance.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:48.860
There is available to us,
recognizes Plato, a capacity

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.890
for playful imitation.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.820
And it's the contrast between
this and the fourth, the thing

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:59.280
that Plato finds most
problematic, that will help us

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.480
get to the heart of
Plato's picture.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.580
Because what's most

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.910
problematic on Plato's picture--

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.370
and we'll give some contemporary
analogues of this

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.840
in a moment--

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:16.070
are cases where imitation of
imaginary figures plus

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.520
habituation to that mode of
behavior leads to what

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:25.730
Aristotle warns us so profoundly
against: a

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:31.550
misguided repertoire of
automatic responses.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.010
So in order to make sense of
this rather subtle argument of

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:41.160
Plato, it's helpful for us to
take a step back and remember

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.020
where it is situated in
the argument of the

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.760
Republic as a whole.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.050
So you'll remember that at
the very beginning of the

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:58.770
semester, back in January, we
started off by reading the

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:04.340
opening pages of book two of
Plato's Republic in which the

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.590
character Glaucon, in alliance
with his brother Adeimantus,

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:12.960
challenges Socrates to answer
the question, why

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.620
should we be just?

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.920
And Glaucon and Adeimantus
together present three kinds

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.240
of arguments, three kinds of
contentions in favor of the

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:32.940
view that justice is not
something that we engage in

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.840
for intrinsic reasons,

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.030
but only something that we
engage in because as a matter

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.860
of contingency it happens to
be instrumentally valuable.

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.130
Famously, Glaucon gives an
argument categorizing justice

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.910
into the kind of good that we
value only because of its

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.670
reputational benefits and goes
on to offer something like a

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:57.240
Prisoners' Dilemma analysis of
justice being everybody's

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.800
second-best choice.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:04.070
He then presents a fictional
story --

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:07.620
the story of the ring of Gyges
followed by the story of the

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.010
pair of statues --

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:13.640
which is meant to persuade
in a different way.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:18.620
And finally, Adeimantus points
out a continuity between

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.080
what's represented in the
context of the fictional

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.950
stories and what's represented
in the

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.230
context of common sayings.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.780
Where does the argument
that Socrates

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:35.450
provides back then begin?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.410
Does Socrates respond directly
to one and two and three?

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:43.420
To the three rather precise
arguments that Glaucon and

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.590
Adeimantus have presented?

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:46.740
No.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:52.220
What he does is to introduce
the larger framework for

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.990
thinking about these questions,
the analogy between

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:58.100
the person and the city.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.600
A discussion subsequently in
Book Two that we didn't read

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.120
of two kinds of cities
there might be.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.940
And then ultimately in the
context of Book Four, he

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:11.340
introduces the three parts of
the city and the three parts

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.840
of the soul.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:17.220
There he says that just as in
the ideal city there are

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.360
guardians and soldiers and
workers, so too in the

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:26.110
individual, there is reason,
spirit and appetite.

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.770
And you may remember back when
there was so much snow on the

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.820
ground that there was no way
to represent humanity other

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.260
than in the form of a snowman,
that we looked at this

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.640
parallel in some detail.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.570
We looked at the way in which
the smallest directive part of

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.210
the soul is reason.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.510
The middle is spirit.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:50.660
The bottom is appetite.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:56.410
And that corresponding to these
auxiliaries, soldiers

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:59.340
and guardians.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:05.130
Now in order to see what's going
on in the discussion in

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.980
Books Three and Four that we
read for today about the

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:13.680
censorship of poetry and the
discussion in Book Ten about

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.930
the censorship of poetry, we
need to recognize something

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:23.630
really extremely interesting
about what happens

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.150
next in Book Two.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.580
So remember, we have Glaucon's
challenge, why

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.430
should we be just?

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:35.495
And Socrates' rather bizarre
answer, which involves the

00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:40.670
invocation of the city-state
analogy.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:47.390
What happens next is that
Socrates goes on to provide an

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:55.800
account of how it is that the
guardians should be educated.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.890
And the kind of education that
he is concerned with is the

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:09.420
education of the non-rational
parts of the guardians' soul.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:16.280
What's going on here is Plato's
recognition that,

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:22.940
given the picture he has of the
state, just as "argument

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.690
alone," as Aristotle would say,
"is not enough to make

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:30.790
men good:" rather we must
cultivate in them certain

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:33.300
kinds of habits.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.690
So too suggests Plato, by
putting the education of the

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:42.000
guardians immediately after the
discussion of the nature

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.830
and value of justice, so too
is it crucial in thinking

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:52.900
about the structure of the state
to think not only about

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.540
what laws look like--

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.990
that which regulates
by means of reason.

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:05.100
But also what non-rational
influences look like.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:10.560
So, says Plato, turning to the
education of the guardians,

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:15.180
the very first question we
need to ask when we think

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.010
about what the ideal state looks
like is the question,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.370
what does the early education,
the cultivation of appropriate

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.000
spirit and appetite in the
guardians look like?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.010
And only once that is in place
are we in a position to turn

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:38.190
to that which is most valorized
by Plato in his

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:42.660
discussion, the cultivation
of reason.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:45.260
So let's hear exactly
what Plato has to

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:48.010
say about early education.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.030
And in pointing this out to you,
I want to remind you of

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:55.810
something that I mentioned last
lecture about the Nozick

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.770
and the Rawls.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:01.360
You'll recall that I mentioned
to you that in the entire

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.500
index of A Theory of Justice
and in the entire index of

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:11.110
Anarchy, State, and Utopia,
there are two

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:14.080
references to children.

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:19.970
There are basically no
discussions of education,

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:25.970
whereas the very first thing
that Plato starts with in his

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:30.070
discussion of the ideal
state is this.

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:33.775
For the guardians, he asks, what
will their education be?

00:25:33.775 --> 00:25:38.490
"You know, don't you, that the
beginning of any process is

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.510
most important.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:42.570
Especially for anything
young and tender.

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:47.400
It's at that time that it is
most malleable and takes on

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.680
any pattern one wishes
to impress on it.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.380
Shall we carelessly allow the
children to hear any old

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.240
stories and to take beliefs
into their souls that are

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:02.390
opposite to the ones we think
they should hold when they are

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:06.450
grown up?" And, this being
a Socratic dialogue, his

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:11.340
interlocutor says, "We certainly
won't." And Socrates

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.030
continues, "Then we
must first of all

00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:17.210
supervise the story tellers.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.820
We'll select their stories
whenever they are fine or

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.280
beautiful and reject them
when they aren't.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:26.940
Nurses and mothers will shape
their children's souls with

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.340
their stories much more than
they shape their bodies with

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.910
their handling."

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:40.590
There was recently a
conversation about this

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:49.700
familiar character, Mister
Cookie Monster, who, in

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:56.110
keeping with remarks like the
one Socrates just made, began

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:03.770
singing songs like, "A Cookie
is a Sometimes Thing" and

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:11.900
began appearing in videos
about healthy foods.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.050
It is the recognition that
early narratives play a

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:22.970
strangely formative role in the
attitudes of young people

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:29.750
that would lead to this
sort of change.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:34.490
So Plato's first concern is
the one that I identified.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.290
The idea that you will be
presented with a role model,

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.510
whom you will problematically
accept as a

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.620
reasonable way of existence.

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:48.680
When the poets tell stories,
he says, where "heroes do

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:52.060
terrible and impious deeds,"
these stories are harmful to

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:53.470
the people who hear them.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.840
For "everyone will be ready to
excuse himself when he is bad

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.010
if he is persuaded that
similar things have

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.020
been done by heroes.

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:08.760
For that reason, we must put a
stop to such stories lest they

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:14.390
produce in youth a strong
inclination" to do bad things.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:18.800
If it's available to you to
say, here's a character--

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.760
real or imaginary--

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:26.400
who behaved in a particular way,
says Plato, you are at

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.850
risk of viewing your behavior
through that light.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:39.330
Even more dangerous, however,
is the fact it is possible

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.350
because of our complicated
relation to fiction, to

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:50.070
respond to something imaginary
in a way just different enough

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:57.070
to distort our experience but
just similar enough to affect

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.680
us implicitly.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.080
"Listen and consider," says
Plato famously in Book Ten,

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.680
"when even the best of us hear
Homer or some other tragedian

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.200
imitating one of the heroes or
making a long lamenting speech

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.020
or beating his breast,
we enjoy it.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.090
We give ourselves up
to following it.

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.690
We sympathize with the hero
and we take his suffering

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:27.870
seriously." And we do so, says
Socrates, even when that runs

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:32.470
counter to how it is that on
reflection we think we ought

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.800
to behave.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.650
"When one of us," he continues,
"suffers a private

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.630
loss, you realize the
opposite happens.

00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:43.810
We pride ourselves if we're
able to master our grief.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.720
Is it right to look at someone
behaving in a way we would

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.880
consider unworthy and shameful
and enjoy and praise it rather

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.430
than being disgusted by it?" And
he goes through and runs

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.250
with another series of
emotions about this.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.650
He says, just as we can do this
for sadness, so too we

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:12.290
appreciate in the context of
fiction buffoonish humor.

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:16.880
We appreciate in the context
of fiction certain kinds of

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.120
outrageous behavior.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:27.110
But we are, he says, exactly the
wrong distance to be safe.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.680
Our relation to fiction in this
regard is paradoxical.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.330
On the one hand, there is
sufficient difference between

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:43.760
fiction and reality that we let
our emotions run loose.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:47.450
Reason says: it's just
imagination.

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:50.390
It doesn't matter how
I respond to it.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.390
This isn't reality.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:57.690
This isn't reflective of who I.
Am But to the extent that

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:02.460
there is sufficient similarity
between the two cases, to the

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.250
extent that the distancing
happens only at the level of

00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:11.120
reason, there is a risk
of contagion.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:16.020
And we can see that perhaps most
profoundly by contrasting

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.580
the sort of cases that Plato is
worried about with the sort

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:25.100
of cases that he is
ostensibly not.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:30.220
So in Book Three Plato concedes
that there are

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:37.990
certain contexts in which it
seems to be OK to engage with

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:41.180
imagination, to engage
with fiction.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:44.900
He writes, when he-- he's now
speaking of the guardians--

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.450
comes upon a character unworthy
of himself, he'll be

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:51.780
unwilling to make himself
seriously resemble the

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.770
inferior character.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:59.410
Rather, he'll be "ashamed to do
something like that unless

00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:06.390
it is in play." And
it does seem--

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.010
and it's an extremely
interesting

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.640
fact about human beings--

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:17.100
that we are capable in some
contexts of taking a genuinely

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:19.940
play stance.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:26.180
In my section, when I played
prisoners' dilemma games, the

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:29.250
poor freshman who played against
me-- who's seated here

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.040
in the third row--

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.080
didn't understand that I was
playing for play, which meant

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.110
that I was playing for real,
which meant that I defected

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:42.330
every single round.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.850
And she lost a lot of money
and I gained a lot.

00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:53.380
Now in so doing, it is my
sense that I had removed

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:58.780
myself from a domain where
contagion was a risk.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.550
That not just at the level of
thinking about my engagement,

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:07.650
but even in the engagement
itself there was a sort of

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.226
ironic distance.

00:33:10.226 --> 00:33:15.760
Some fictional representations
cause us to bear that to at

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.980
least part of their content.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.960
In Monty Python, when you watch
Sir Lancelot chop off

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.650
the arms and then the legs of
the Black Knight, who is

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:31.080
leaping around bleeding,
it is not--

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:36.710
I take it-- the case that there
is even a small risk of

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:42.000
contagion to actual cases
of lost limbs.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.820
But rather that a certain
kind of playful

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.820
stance is being taken.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:55.199
At least that is until
it is disrupted.

00:33:55.199 --> 00:34:01.139
I was, for very good reason,
taken to task on the feedback

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:06.350
page by one of the students in
this class for presenting

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.880
playfully in lecture, in the
context of our discussion of

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.610
punishment, an example of
somebody who aimed to shoot

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:22.890
somebody and failed or succeeded
at his aim on a day

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:27.680
after there had been a shooting
in New Haven.

00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:33.430
Sometimes the reality that
surrounds a situation makes it

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:35.460
almost impossible --

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.550
because of the way in which it
permeates our non-rational

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.840
responses --

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:46.750
makes it almost impossible for
us to take a playful stance.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.120
But the fact that we're able
to move in and out of this

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.380
attitude is, I think, one of
the most perplexing and

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:59.410
interesting facts about
human beings.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:04.130
What's undeniable is that in
addition to being able to

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:09.370
engage in this sort of distant
imitation, this sort of

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:15.740
playful, non-habituating
copying, we are also capable

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:20.690
of engaging in imitation that
gives rise to habituation.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.650
So, Plato writes, "Our guardians
must imitate from

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:27.575
childhood what is appropriate
to them." Namely, people who

00:35:27.575 --> 00:35:30.890
are "courageous, self-controlled
and pious.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:34.460
They mustn't be clever at doing
shameful actions, lest

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:36.450
from enjoying the imitation
they come

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.180
to enjoy the reality.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.280
Or haven't you noticed that
imitations practiced from

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:47.190
youth become part of nature
and settle into habits of

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:53.300
gesture, voice and
thought?" Crazy?

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:57.340
Well, here's an article from
last week's New York Times

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:02.812
discussing the video
game Madden NFL 12.

00:36:02.812 --> 00:36:07.430
Do any of you play
this online game?

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.670
Excellent.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:15.190
So what is the feature of Madden
NFL 12 that struck the

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.760
New York Times as interesting?

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.620
It was this.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:27.440
In the new version of Madden
NFL 12, a player who gets a

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.770
concussion is automatically
eliminated from play.

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:34.810
"Ever since the seriousness of
concussions became apparent on

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:38.220
the national scale," reads this
article from April 2,

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.620
"the primary message for young
football players -- if you get

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.110
a concussion get off the field
for the rest of the day--

00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.950
has been one of the most
difficult for youngsters to

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.770
accept and execute.

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:52.870
That reality will soon be aided
by fantasy," -- it's

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:54.890
like it's channeling Plato --

00:36:54.890 --> 00:36:58.730
"Madden NFL 12, the coming
version of the eerily

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:02.090
true-to-life NFL video game
played by millions of gamers,

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.760
will be realistic enough, not
only" it says, "to show

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.390
players receiving the
concussions, but also to show

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:11.420
that any player who sustains one
is sidelined for the rest

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.290
of the game, no exceptions."

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:21.140
So fantasy in the aid of
social regulation.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.440
Here's another example.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:32.310
How does the US military train
soldiers for the battlefield?

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.710
Some of what it does is
obviously to cultivate their

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:39.610
bodies in such a way that they
have the strength and stamina

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.670
to engage in certain
sorts of behaviors.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:47.900
But one of the primary
modes of training is

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:51.480
through video games.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:59.160
So here is a group of soldiers
playing a game that was

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.150
initially just used as a part of
a recruiting video for the

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.440
US army, a recruiting tool
called America's Army.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.620
And subsequently got developed
into a training tool for

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.570
soldiers themselves.

00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:14.760
Here's a group of soldiers
engaging

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.500
in video game practice.

00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.840
And here's an article in
the Washington Post

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.030
from a few years ago.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.880
"Virtual reality play prepares
soldiers for real war.

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.520
One blistering afternoon in Iraq
while fighting insurgents

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:36.550
in the northern town of Mosul,
Sgt. Sinkway Sualez opened

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.570
fire with his 50-caliber.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:43.200
That was only the second time,
he says, that he ever shot an

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.740
enemy, a human enemy.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.340
'It felt like I was in a big
video game,' he said. 'It

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.860
didn't even faze me,
shooting back.

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.940
It was just a natural
instinct.

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:57.160
Boom, boom, boom,' remembers
Sualez, a fast-talking

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.500
deep-voice, barrel-chested
29-year-old from

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.730
Chesterfield, Virginia.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:04.490
He was a combat engineer in
Iraq for nearly a year.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.050
And Sualez continues, 'the
insurgents were firing from

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:08.260
the other side the bridge.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.940
We called in a helicopter
for an airstrike.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.100
I couldn't believe I
was seeing this.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.830
It was like Halo.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:17.720
It didn't seem real.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.670
But it was real.'"

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:26.700
And later in the article, the
reporter goes on to quote an

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:31.100
Army official from the office
of Defense Modeling and

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:35.790
Simulation who says, "The
technology in games has

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:41.750
facilitated a revolution
in the art of warfare.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.400
When the time came for him"--

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.340
meaning Sualez--

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.200
says this officer, "to fire his
weapon he was ready to do

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.880
that and capable of doing it.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.720
His experience leading up
to that time through the

00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:00.540
on-the-ground training and the
playing of Halo and whatever

00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.510
else, enabled him to execute.

00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:07.930
His situation awareness
was up.

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:10.620
He knew what he had to do.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:16.570
He had done it before or
something like it up to that

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:19.170
point."

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:28.260
So Plato's argument starts to
feel like it has some force.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.290
What exactly does the
argument look like?

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.650
The argument that we've
been considering in

00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:38.570
Plato runs as follows.

00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:42.160
Plato suggests that fiction
affects the non-rational parts

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.280
of the soul in such a way that
they are potentially

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:50.340
disharmonious with the
rational part.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:54.790
That is, fiction may cause us to
find appealing things that

00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.760
on reflection we find
unappealing, or to find

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.050
unappealing things that on
reflection we find appealing.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.550
It may, of course, also allow
us to cultivate things that

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:09.400
are in harmony with
our commitment.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:13.520
Therapy can use exactly the
same techniques that video

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.540
game training in the Army does
to bring our non-rational

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.950
responses in line with
our rational ones.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:26.520
But it is certainly a risk that
fiction will affect the

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.370
non-rational parts of the soul
in a way that renders them

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:32.310
disharmonious with the
rational part.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:36.310
We, says Plato, reflectively
desire--

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:39.360
for all the reasons that we
discussed in the first part of

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.790
this course--

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:46.680
to have our souls, at least for
the most part, in harmony.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.320
When we are not instinctively
reacting in ways that we're

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.750
reflectively committed to act,
it is costly to us and

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.330
undesirable.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:02.990
But what we might think of as
the easy way out of this

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:07.180
problem, just saying to
ourselves, "it's only Halo,

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:14.440
it's only a video game," turns
out not to be sufficient.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:20.860
Individuals, says Plato, even
the best of us, cannot

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.610
regulate these effects
internally

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:26.390
through our own reason.

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:35.060
We are not fully in control of
the parts of ourselves through

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:37.450
reason alone.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:42.860
Instead, he says, it is possible
to regulate these

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:48.590
effects externally by letting
society make decisions for us

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:53.800
about what we are and
are not exposed to.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:43:00.550
Consequently, in an argument
much like the one we see in

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:09.680
Hobbes, Plato is suggesting in
Book Ten that what rationality

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:16.040
requires, given our recognition
of limits that it

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.720
hits up against, is a
willingness to restrict our

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.730
freedom in certain ways.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:30.720
Just as Hobbes argues that the
coordination problem to which

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.530
the Prisoner's Dilemma gives
rise, means that we need to

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:39.370
subject ourselves to a sovereign
who takes control

00:43:39.370 --> 00:43:46.180
and enforces contracts, so too
does Plato suggest that we

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:55.450
need to subject ourselves to a
regulation by reflection of

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.890
aspects of experience that will
affect us in ways that

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:03.770
from a distance we know to be
dangerous, but from up close

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:08.510
we're unable to protect
ourselves from.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:14.120
Now, that's not an easy argument
to take on board.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.320
It raises all sorts
of questions about

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:19.340
who does the deciding.

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:22.320
It raises all sorts of questions
about whether

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:28.410
non-rational manipulation is in
fact the role of the state.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.880
But it also reminds us that if
we are trying to think about

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.090
what political structures need
to look like for complicated

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:42.930
creatures such as ourselves,
there will, in the end, be no

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.840
easy answers.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:51.450
And in next Tuesday's lecture,
I'll begin with what I'm going

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.580
to ask as the first question.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.260
Which is, what does this have
to do with Sunstein?

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:01.630
But I will, in the meantime,
post the slides that are

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.730
associated with Sunstein so that
if you want to get a head

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:09.470
start on that second question,
about how non-rational

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:13.060
persuasion might happen in
society, you can take a look

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.380
at those over the weekend.

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:18.480
Thanks very much and I'll see
those of you who are not

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.080
visiting Bulldogs on Tuesday.

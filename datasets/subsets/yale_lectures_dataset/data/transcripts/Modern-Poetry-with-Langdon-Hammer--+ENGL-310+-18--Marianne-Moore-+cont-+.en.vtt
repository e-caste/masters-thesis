00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.258
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Let's see,

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:09.441
last time I wanted to talk to
you about Moore as a woman poet,

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:13.350
as an American poet,
and as a nature poet.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.240
I didn't get very far with the
latter.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.587
I started talking about that
long, really tough poem,

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:27.290
"An Octopus," about Mount
Rainier.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.349
I'd like to go back there and
to work through a little bit of

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.120
that poem with you.
 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.883
I suggested that this octopus
that Moore is writing about,

00:00:43.883 --> 00:00:51.420
this mountain,
is at once something other,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.921
something out there,
and an emblem of the power of

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.350
the natural world.
 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.489
And on the other hand,
something that Moore identifies

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.706
with: certain qualities of the
mountain – its energy,

00:01:04.706 --> 00:01:07.966
its force.
The image of the octopus

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.849
itself, the glacier on top of
Mount Rainier,

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:14.738
has, I think,
sort of eight arms,

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:18.439
and that's what she is playing
with.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.713
And I suggested that there's
something octopus-like about

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:23.000
Marianne Moore,
too,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.829
with those long lines that
snake out and seem to grasp onto

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.377
all sorts of stuff,
producing this poetry of

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:40.739
collage and multiple voices.
 

00:01:40.739 --> 00:01:44.876
Let me see if I can work
through the end of the poem with

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:49.490
you, from around;
well, there's a long last

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.167
stanza, or paragraph,
whatever you would like to call

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:03.230
it, that begins on page 444 at
the bottom, line 161.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.322
Moore is talking about here,
maybe confusingly or

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:19.479
unhelpfully, Greek aesthetics,
while she's also talking about

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:28.044
the creatures and people that
inhabit this place that she's

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:32.770
writing about,
Mount Rainier.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.690
She says on the middle of page
445 about the Greeks--it's hard

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.639
to quote from this poem.
 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:46.175
It's hard to enter it at any
point because each thing is

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:49.518
connected to the other,
and to make sense of anything

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:51.190
you have to work back.
 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.257
She says:
Well, how do you approach

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:00.347
nature?
In a sense, that's the great

00:03:00.347 --> 00:03:01.759
question of the poem.
 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:06.553
Here, the brochure is telling
us, well, we shouldn't approach

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.110
it with guns,
nets, et cetera;

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.080
we won't be welcome there.
 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.979
Moore is going to develop this
idea a little bit further.

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:22.504
She says, in a sense,
why bother putting all that

00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:26.091
down?
Moore prodigiously includes

00:03:26.091 --> 00:03:31.964
these quotations from a hiking
handbook, and then includes

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:37.940
lyrical language like "this
fossil flower concise without a

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.380
shiver,"
shifting between these

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.440
registers of diction,
and then sees the mountain as,

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.368
in that sense,
as some kind of special flower

00:03:50.368 --> 00:03:52.690
"intact when it is cut."
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.037
And then she calls the mountain
"damned for its sacrosanct

00:03:56.037 --> 00:04:00.285
remoteness";
that is, she's saying people

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:07.748
damn this mountain because it's
too high and far and remote to

00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:11.702
climb.
"Sacrosanct remoteness":

00:04:11.702 --> 00:04:15.030
that's a suggestive phrase.
 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.348
It would seem to imply that the
mountain was being damned for

00:04:21.348 --> 00:04:27.351
possibly what we would recognize
as ethical qualities in a

00:04:27.351 --> 00:04:30.979
person;
that is, some kind of eliteness

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.898
and some kind of reserve;
in fact, properties that you

00:04:34.898 --> 00:04:38.595
might find in an author "like
Henry James's damned by the

00:04:38.595 --> 00:04:42.941
public for decorum.'"
Here, Moore makes a strange and

00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:47.839
wild association between the
mountain and Henry James,

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:53.787
as if the mountain were somehow
a kind of image of that great

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:59.388
early modernist prose writer,
"damned by the public for

00:04:59.388 --> 00:05:03.587
decorum";
that is, damned for his elite

00:05:03.587 --> 00:05:08.643
posture, the demands he placed
upon the reader,

00:05:08.643 --> 00:05:13.480
and his high level of decorum
in writing.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.393
And then she corrects herself,
she says: "not decorum,

00:05:18.393 --> 00:05:22.417
but restraint."
That's what James exemplifies

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:26.299
and that's what the mountain,
it seems, exacts,

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:27.699
too.
She continues,

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.069
and now she's talking about
Henry James.

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:34.255
it is the love of [well,
and moving out of Henry James

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:36.311
into a general
principle]

00:05:36.311 --> 00:05:42.119
doing hard things [whether it's
climbing the mountain or reading

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:45.389
late James]
that rebuffed and wore them out

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.220
[the public]--a public out of
sympathy with neatness.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.794
"Neatness."
She arrives here,

00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:59.046
substituting one term for
another: first "remoteness,"

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:03.220
then "decorum;"
not "decorum" but "restraint;"

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.329
not "restraint" precisely,
necessarily or only,

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:11.260
but "neatness," a kind of
ascetic quality.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.960
"Neatness of finish!
 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.759
Neatness of finish!"
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.225
she says, she exclaims,
those two exclamation points

00:06:21.225 --> 00:06:25.339
following as if,
well, how does she say them?

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.908
Is it in a spirit of
exasperation with this public

00:06:28.908 --> 00:06:33.424
that's worn out by the demands
placed on them by a certain kind

00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:36.920
of writing or by a certain kind
of mountain?

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:45.326
Is she here mocking the idea of
"neatness of finish" or raising

00:06:45.326 --> 00:06:50.750
it as a kind of banner and
battle cry?

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.490
Now she moves back again to the
mountain.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.339
Relentless accuracy [and
here she'll name it "the

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.940
octopus" again]
is the

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.750
nature of this octopus
with its capacity for

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.074
fact.
She's talking about the

00:07:12.074 --> 00:07:16.604
mountain, but the mountain
itself seems now to be the

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:20.089
embodiment of a certain kind of
mind,

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:26.346
a certain kind of imagination
that grasps at and absorbs and

00:07:26.346 --> 00:07:29.209
comes to assimilate fact.
 

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:38.685
And then she will turn herself
over in these closing lines to a

00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:47.244
series of quotations that
describe the mountain and do so

00:07:47.244 --> 00:07:56.414
with a lyric exultation that
climbs to the romantic "sublime"

00:07:56.414 --> 00:08:03.750
and does so in this strange
collage form:

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:10.143
It's an extraordinary kind of
celebration and declaration,

00:08:10.143 --> 00:08:16.760
a celebration of the frankly
savage forces that the mountain

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:21.920
both embodies and endures at its
altitude.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:28.401
And as she does,
she suggests that there are

00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:36.692
similar forces of primal
violence and intensity that are

00:08:36.692 --> 00:08:46.490
contained and indeed expressed
in the writing of Henry James,

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:52.455
in the aesthetic project of
restraint that she herself

00:08:52.455 --> 00:08:59.546
engages in and that she calls us
to and calls "the love of doing

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:03.532
hard things,"
whether that's climbing a

00:09:03.532 --> 00:09:05.769
mountain or reading poems.
 

00:09:05.769 --> 00:09:12.706
This closing passage is so
powerful and interesting because

00:09:12.706 --> 00:09:19.523
Moore moves from a kind of
writing which is often ascribed

00:09:19.523 --> 00:09:25.368
to her or identified with her,
that is, description:

00:09:25.368 --> 00:09:28.757
precise observation of the
natural world,

00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:33.332
a kind of writing that is
frequently seen as limited in

00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:36.889
its ambition and its emotional
power,

00:09:36.889 --> 00:09:42.260
but that, amassed here in this
sequence, in fact,

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:48.750
takes on a kind of remarkable
force and lyric intensity.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:55.828
It makes Moore seem not at all
like the restrained or prudish,

00:09:55.828 --> 00:10:02.558
virginal poet that many of her
peers and subsequent readers

00:10:02.558 --> 00:10:05.460
have found her to be.
 

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.009
 
 

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:14.457
The fastidiousness,
decorum, restraint---these

00:10:14.457 --> 00:10:20.091
aesthetic and ethical values in
short are here attached to

00:10:20.091 --> 00:10:25.922
powers and intensity that we
don't ordinarily associate with

00:10:25.922 --> 00:10:27.010
them.
 

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.759
 
 

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:33.433
The volcano,
its whiteness,

00:10:33.433 --> 00:10:37.854
that's important:
"the white volcano with no

00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:43.611
weather side" because the
weather side of the volcano has

00:10:43.611 --> 00:10:47.929
been broken off in an ancient
blast.

00:10:47.929 --> 00:10:55.919
The volcano signifies a kind of
virginal force.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:11:02.311
It is a specifically female
version of elemental power and

00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:07.470
of the Sublime,
of Emersonian self-reliance,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:14.999
that comes to Moore via Emily
Dickinson, who has her volcanoes

00:11:14.999 --> 00:11:17.548
too.
Self-reliance:

00:11:17.548 --> 00:11:23.619
by "self-reliance" I mean
Moore's hardy American

00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:29.690
insistence on self-sufficiency,
on independence,

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.789
and on originality.
 

00:11:32.789 --> 00:11:35.898
And she is, again,
the most radically original of

00:11:35.898 --> 00:11:39.330
all the poets we read,
the least like anybody else,

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:46.971
and this, interestingly,
despite her reliance on

00:11:46.971 --> 00:11:53.149
quotation as her distinctive
medium.

00:11:53.149 --> 00:12:01.423
There's a powerful tradition of
American romanticism that's

00:12:01.423 --> 00:12:08.269
present in Moore,
with feminist ramifications.

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:14.369
And it's interestingly in Moore
joined to a modernist and

00:12:14.369 --> 00:12:18.399
Eliotic aesthetic of
impersonality,

00:12:18.399 --> 00:12:24.289
which we've seen defined in
Eliot's essay on "Tradition and

00:12:24.289 --> 00:12:28.250
the Individual Talent" and
elsewhere.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:33.824
Eliot's modernist aesthetics
were attractive to Moore,

00:12:33.824 --> 00:12:39.398
I think, in part because
Eliot's idea of impersonality

00:12:39.398 --> 00:12:43.500
was compatible with female
modesty,

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.940
with Christian virtue.
 

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:54.109
Let me turn to another poem,
a poem in your RIS packet,

00:12:54.109 --> 00:13:00.350
as helpfully concise as "An
Octopus" is long.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.240
And that's the poem "Silence."
 

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:11.990
And you'll hear a kind of echo
of the lines I just read.

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:15.960
Another, I think, powerful poem.
 

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:22.424
We saw Moore correct herself in
"An Octopus," saying "not

00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:25.309
decorum but restraint."
 

00:13:25.309 --> 00:13:30.379
Here she says "not in silence,
but restraint."

00:13:30.379 --> 00:13:36.195
"The deepest feeling," she
says, "shows itself" in

00:13:36.195 --> 00:13:41.082
restraint.
"Shows itself" in restraint:

00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:47.019
somehow the very act of
restraint is allied to an

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:51.100
expressive act of
self-disclosure,

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.440
paradoxically perhaps.
 

00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:01.511
The keys to our deep identity
are disclosed in some of the

00:14:01.511 --> 00:14:05.730
ways in which they are withheld.
 

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:11.196
This is a theme from one of the
poems behind this poem,

00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:15.649
which I've quoted for you on
your handout,

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:19.448
from Longfellow,
from his poem of grief called

00:14:19.448 --> 00:14:22.909
"Resignation":
"by silence sanctifying,

00:14:22.909 --> 00:14:27.710
not concealing,
/ the grief that must have

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.858
way."
Moore's writing,

00:14:30.858 --> 00:14:37.844
though remote in form from
Longfellow or Emerson,

00:14:37.844 --> 00:14:43.400
for that matter,
or Holmes, another poet we'll

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:48.211
look at later today,
is nonetheless deeply involved

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:52.059
in nineteenth-century American
poems.

00:14:52.059 --> 00:15:00.979
Here, the poem's silence itself
seems to be an example of what

00:15:00.979 --> 00:15:07.049
it's talking about;
that is, it reveals something

00:15:07.049 --> 00:15:11.909
about Moore silently through
what is not said,

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:18.461
or rather through the ways that
what is said gestures towards

00:15:18.461 --> 00:15:23.341
what is not.
It's a poem that presumes to

00:15:23.341 --> 00:15:29.206
speak or presents itself as
speaking for the poet,

00:15:29.206 --> 00:15:31.960
in the first person.
 

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:37.689
"My father used to say";
well, curiously Moore is really

00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:44.997
not in at least an explicit way
speaking about her father or

00:15:44.997 --> 00:15:47.970
what her father said.
 

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.713
Moore included in her
Selected Poems notes that

00:15:52.713 --> 00:15:57.546
disclose some of the sources
that she was quoting from,

00:15:57.546 --> 00:16:00.590
borrowing from,
and collaging.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:08.207
And this particular poem bares
a note that attributes much of

00:16:08.207 --> 00:16:12.270
this quotation to a certain A.M.
 

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:17.983
Homans, who is,
in fact, a distant relative of

00:16:17.983 --> 00:16:22.299
my colleague Margaret Homans.
 

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:25.952
This Miss Homans,
who supplies most of what's in

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:30.149
the quotation there,
is not Marianne Moore's father,

00:16:30.149 --> 00:16:36.391
so she's sort of borrowed words
for her father from another

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:39.262
source.
And yet at the same time

00:16:39.262 --> 00:16:44.019
there's real poignancy in this
and an expressive poignancy.

00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:47.309
Moore is telling us something
about herself.

00:16:47.309 --> 00:16:53.232
She's being silent about the
very early death of her own

00:16:53.232 --> 00:16:59.116
father who was therefore,
in fact, a silent presence in

00:16:59.116 --> 00:17:05.069
her life, who told no stories to
her and said no sayings,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:10.569
and whom she couldn't,
in fact, quote in this manner.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:16.854
"Silence," this short poem,
is at once a modernist poem

00:17:16.854 --> 00:17:23.371
that Eliot would have understood
and admired and close to

00:17:23.371 --> 00:17:30.819
nineteenth-century poems in its
ethical values and concerns.

00:17:30.819 --> 00:17:35.361
It suggests too,
I think, some of Moore's

00:17:35.361 --> 00:17:40.925
perhaps ambivalent,
certainly complex relationship

00:17:40.925 --> 00:17:46.035
to her male peers:
a topic that I talked about

00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:52.279
last time with her poem "A
Grave" in front of us,

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:57.109
which was connected to that
correspondence with Pound.

00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:03.436
I also mentioned her
correspondence with Hart Crane

00:18:03.436 --> 00:18:11.155
who submitted his poems to her
in her role as editor at The

00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:14.307
Dial,
where she was,

00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:18.470
in fact, in a very powerful
position in literary culture.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.170
In certain ways,
Moore had a kind of established

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:28.069
authority in that culture that
Crane never had.

00:18:28.069 --> 00:18:32.255
Here, she had an important job
picking poems,

00:18:32.255 --> 00:18:36.059
editing writing,
reviewing, and otherwise

00:18:36.059 --> 00:18:41.766
shaping the tastes of American
readers through this important

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:44.809
magazine, The Dial.
 

00:18:44.809 --> 00:18:50.616
And yet, at the same time,
Moore always has a kind of

00:18:50.616 --> 00:18:57.539
marginal and combative relation
to her major male peers that is

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:04.240
suggested in "A Grave" and in
her irritation at the man who's

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.920
blocking her view.
 

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:11.929
When you read Elizabeth
Bishop's memoir of Moore –

00:19:11.929 --> 00:19:16.250
Elizabeth Bishop,
Moore's great protégé –

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:22.144
that really wonderful bit of
both biography and autobiography

00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:27.939
that I asked you to read for
this class called Efforts of

00:19:27.939 --> 00:19:33.007
Affection,
in there you see Moore

00:19:33.007 --> 00:19:40.935
interacting with the male poets
of her era in interesting and

00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:45.959
comical ways.
Remember how some of them

00:19:45.959 --> 00:19:50.668
appear.
Bishop notes the presence of

00:19:50.668 --> 00:19:58.361
Ezra Pound in the Moores's
apartment when Moore notes that

00:19:58.361 --> 00:20:04.839
Pound had burned the banister
with his cigar.

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:08.412
He had to keep his cigar out of
Mrs.

00:20:08.412 --> 00:20:12.699
Moore's apartment,
and this sort of flaming

00:20:12.699 --> 00:20:16.680
phallic object burns the
staircase.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:22.719
Bishop also tells about seeing
a valentine that T.S.

00:20:22.719 --> 00:20:27.220
Eliot had written to Marianne
Moore;

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.779
Pound with a cigar and Eliot
with his valentine.

00:20:31.779 --> 00:20:36.909
And then there's an account of
a reading where Bishop heard

00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:42.127
Moore read with William Carlos
Williams who – Williams did

00:20:42.127 --> 00:20:47.079
– made "loud" and "realistic"
"sea monster" roars.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:53.548
All of these are kind of comic,
and yet suggestive,

00:20:53.548 --> 00:21:01.309
symbolic representations of
phallic power through display,

00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:07.690
imposition, condescension,
et cetera, all of which Moore

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:13.605
seemed to manage to keep at
arm's length through her

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:20.115
distinctive life choices,
which entailed living with her

00:21:20.115 --> 00:21:26.302
mother in an apartment in the
Village and then on Cumberland

00:21:26.302 --> 00:21:28.609
Street in Brooklyn.
 

00:21:28.609 --> 00:21:33.337
Moore's literary life,
her imagination,

00:21:33.337 --> 00:21:40.055
was rooted in this domestic
space that Bishop describes

00:21:40.055 --> 00:21:45.279
powerfully and minutely in her
memoir;

00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:51.957
a domestic space that had all
sorts of eccentric rituals and

00:21:51.957 --> 00:21:57.503
charms, a specifically
female-centered world where

00:21:57.503 --> 00:22:04.408
Moore could admit men like Pound
but where mother and daughter

00:22:04.408 --> 00:22:10.293
could lead their cultured
literary lives very much on

00:22:10.293 --> 00:22:17.329
their own terms,
without any men to answer to.

00:22:17.329 --> 00:22:22.381
Moore's poem,
evoked in Bishop's essay,

00:22:22.381 --> 00:22:30.890
is a version you could say of
the many shelters that you find,

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:36.164
or shells or protective armor,
that you encounter in Moore's

00:22:36.164 --> 00:22:38.045
poems.
She admires,

00:22:38.045 --> 00:22:43.192
is always fascinated by,
armored animals and the kinds

00:22:43.192 --> 00:22:47.660
of protection they seem to carry
with them.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:53.000
"The Pangolin" is one example.
 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.660
Poems are also for Moore forms
of shelter, I would say.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.766
They're spaces in which she
could construct a world,

00:23:03.766 --> 00:23:07.550
or parts of a world,
again, very much on her own

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.609
terms, according to her own
rules.

00:23:10.609 --> 00:23:16.398
Like her home,
her writing was made safe,

00:23:16.398 --> 00:23:23.054
habitable, strong,
and pleasurable by virtue of

00:23:23.054 --> 00:23:30.289
the limitations that she imposed
upon herself.

00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:36.675
This is connected powerfully to
Moore's ethical ideas and to her

00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:42.162
feminism.
Bishop writes about Moore in

00:23:42.162 --> 00:23:50.439
"Efforts of Affection"
often expressing ways in

00:23:50.439 --> 00:23:54.730
which she,
Bishop, as a young writer

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:59.974
chafed under the curious rules
and disciplines of the Moore

00:23:59.974 --> 00:24:03.620
household.
And yet, she seems to

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:10.210
understand the power that was in
those rules for Moore.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:15.937
And Bishop defends Moore's
feminism specifically against

00:24:15.937 --> 00:24:22.081
the kinds of attacks made on
Moore or dismissals of Moore by

00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:27.080
specifically sixties and
seventies feminism.

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:34.529
Bishop says:
Do they know that [that

00:24:34.529 --> 00:24:40.551
is, feminist critics of Moore]
Marianne Moore was a feminist

00:24:40.551 --> 00:24:43.653
in her day?
Or that she paraded with the

00:24:43.653 --> 00:24:46.625
suffragettes…?
Once, Marianne told me,

00:24:46.625 --> 00:24:51.384
she "climbed a lamppost" in a
demonstration for votes for

00:24:51.384 --> 00:24:53.990
women.
What she did up there,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:57.922
what speech she delivered,
if any, I don't know,

00:24:57.922 --> 00:25:02.857
but climb she did in a long
skirt and petticoats and a large

00:25:02.857 --> 00:25:06.039
hat… [She,
Bishop, continues:]

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:09.837
Now that everything can be
said, and done,

00:25:09.837 --> 00:25:14.839
have we anyone who can compare
with Marianne Moore,

00:25:14.839 --> 00:25:19.386
who was at her best when she
made up her own rules and when

00:25:19.386 --> 00:25:23.619
they were strictest--the reverse
of "freedom"?

00:25:23.619 --> 00:25:26.473
She puts that as a question,
but it's not really a question,

00:25:26.473 --> 00:25:29.406
is it?
She's really making a strong

00:25:29.406 --> 00:25:34.954
defense of Moore and of the ways
in which Moore used rules and

00:25:34.954 --> 00:25:39.683
disciplines to exercise a
certain kind of freedom and

00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:44.140
certainly to obtain a certain
kind of power.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:50.913
Moore has her own version of
that statement in that essay at

00:25:50.913 --> 00:25:57.457
the back of the anthology called
"Humility, Concentration,

00:25:57.457 --> 00:26:02.618
and Gusto."
"Gusto" is the sort of virtue

00:26:02.618 --> 00:26:07.717
of, let's say,
energy that Moore approves in

00:26:07.717 --> 00:26:11.664
writing and art,
above all, in certain ways,

00:26:11.664 --> 00:26:15.179
and she says at the bottom of
the page: "Gusto thrives on

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:18.950
freedom,
and freedom in art, as in life."

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:23.724
And art and life are always
versions of each other for

00:26:23.724 --> 00:26:27.958
Moore, "is the result of a
discipline imposed by

00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:30.710
ourselves."
"Freedom in art,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.174
as in life, is the result of a
discipline imposed by

00:26:35.174 --> 00:26:40.056
ourselves."
I've been talking today so far

00:26:40.056 --> 00:26:47.369
about forms of self-effacement
or restraint that one finds,

00:26:47.369 --> 00:26:54.516
let's say, fanatically in Moore
where she is impersonal in her

00:26:54.516 --> 00:27:00.486
self-presentation,
where she quotes and creates

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:08.647
her own voice by quoting others,
and where she seems to withhold

00:27:08.647 --> 00:27:13.440
the first person in multiple
ways.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.906
The most obvious and vivid and
visible form of the rules that

00:27:18.906 --> 00:27:24.099
she sets herself is of course
the way these poems look.

00:27:24.099 --> 00:27:28.055
"An Octopus" and "Silence" are
very unusual poems for Moore

00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:30.509
because they are free-verse
poems.

00:27:30.509 --> 00:27:36.889
By and large Moore's poems are
always organized into these

00:27:36.889 --> 00:27:43.941
complex syllable counts and the
crazy patterns that they produce

00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:47.214
such as in,
well, let's say,

00:27:47.214 --> 00:27:53.193
just look at "The Steeplejack"
or "The Pangolin" on pages 447

00:27:53.193 --> 00:27:57.233
and 449,
or "The Paper Nautilus," which

00:27:57.233 --> 00:28:03.415
I'll talk about in a moment –
poems that have intricate visual

00:28:03.415 --> 00:28:05.769
patterns on the page.
 

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:13.966
They are examples and instances
of Moore making up her own rules

00:28:13.966 --> 00:28:17.869
and finding freedom in them.
 

00:28:17.869 --> 00:28:21.371
They are also images of what
she calls in "An Octopus" a

00:28:21.371 --> 00:28:23.789
"neatness of finish," you could
say.

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:30.223
They present the poems as
highly crafted almost--not just

00:28:30.223 --> 00:28:34.359
visual but almost tactile
objects.

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:41.439
"Ecstasy affords the occasion
and expediency determines the

00:28:41.439 --> 00:28:47.451
form," she said about her poems,
again, referring to those two

00:28:47.451 --> 00:28:51.494
different moments of composition
that she mentions in her letter

00:28:51.494 --> 00:28:54.190
to Pound that I talked about
last time,

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:59.592
where poems seem to come in a
kind of vatic inspiration,

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:05.290
producing a certain pattern
which then she determines quite

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:09.220
consciously to reproduce and
extend.

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:13.109
Let's look at "The Fish" for a
moment.

00:29:13.109 --> 00:29:18.570
It's one of the most intricate
and distinctive and strangest,

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.170
on 436.
And wait a minute, whoa!

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.392
She's rhyming.
This is actually a rhymed poem,

00:29:26.392 --> 00:29:29.930
too, something you might not
immediately hear.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:34.250
But yes, but look at it:
the fish "wade / through black

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.650
jade" or "an / injured fan".
 

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:41.734
This is really adding an extra
twist of the rules,

00:29:41.734 --> 00:29:48.272
making the challenge of writing
that much harder and in so doing

00:29:48.272 --> 00:29:52.230
you might say,
to quote "An Octopus,"

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:56.410
expressing "the love of doing
hard things."

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:03.559
Remember Pound,
his idea of the image.

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:07.130
He wanted to give you direct
presentation of the thing.

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.309
What did he think about this?
 

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:16.358
Here, you've got poems that are
so conspicuously artificial,

00:30:16.358 --> 00:30:20.723
that stress a kind of
discontinuity between form and

00:30:20.723 --> 00:30:23.639
content,
and that really present

00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:28.323
themselves as arbitrary and
constructed, rather than given

00:30:28.323 --> 00:30:30.940
and necessary.
In this way,

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.636
Moore is calling attention
formally to the contingency of

00:30:36.636 --> 00:30:40.400
all her statements and
utterances.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:46.180
She's also calling attention to
the fact that these are made

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:51.569
objects and that they are the
record of their making.

00:30:51.569 --> 00:30:59.042
They're the record of a motive,
what I call "the love of doing

00:30:59.042 --> 00:31:05.902
hard things," or which Moore
just as often might refer to

00:31:05.902 --> 00:31:13.568
simply as love.
Let me point us to a couple of

00:31:13.568 --> 00:31:16.950
other Moore poems.
 

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:21.825
"To a Snail" for example,
on page 446,

00:31:21.825 --> 00:31:27.624
another short,
free verse poem written in the

00:31:27.624 --> 00:31:35.267
two- or three-year period where
she wrote free verse poems,

00:31:35.267 --> 00:31:39.259
around 1924.
If "compression is the

00:31:39.259 --> 00:31:44.119
first grace of style,"
you [snail] have it.

00:31:44.119 --> 00:31:47.125
Compression,
"contractility":

00:31:47.125 --> 00:31:52.170
these are virtues,
"as modesty is a virtue," and

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:57.386
they're forms of modesty:
What we value in writing in

00:31:57.386 --> 00:32:01.895
style is the principle that is
hid, a kind of animating motive

00:32:01.895 --> 00:32:06.408
that informs what we have,
what's there before us,

00:32:06.408 --> 00:32:12.381
but which is necessarily in
some sense silent and expressed

00:32:12.381 --> 00:32:15.779
through restraint,
as it were.

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:23.860
A compressed style such as
Moore's seems to compress and

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:29.150
contain an important human
motive.

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:33.998
Another poem about the
aesthetics of style that,

00:32:33.998 --> 00:32:40.497
again, moves between principles
in art and principles in life is

00:32:40.497 --> 00:32:46.790
the poem in your RIS packet
called "When I Buy Pictures,"

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:54.791
in which Moore says:
And then she gives a number of

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:56.940
different examples.
 

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:01.180
Further down,
she starts to generalize again.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.679
She says:
The shelters,

00:33:03.679 --> 00:33:07.335
the objects,
the artworks that Moore finds

00:33:07.335 --> 00:33:11.079
exemplary that she wants to care
about,

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:16.290
that she wants us to care about
and that she wants her poems to

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:20.240
exemplify, would be forms of
acknowledgement,

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.975
acknowledging the spiritual
forces that have brought them

00:33:23.975 --> 00:33:27.309
into being: the principles that
are hid in them,

00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:32.088
those forces about which they
are ultimately and can only ever

00:33:32.088 --> 00:33:33.890
be ultimately silent.
 

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:41.019
 
 

00:33:41.019 --> 00:33:46.152
Those spiritual forces,
they have a kind of energy,

00:33:46.152 --> 00:33:50.420
they have light.
They're lit by "piercing

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.849
glances into the life of
things."

00:33:53.849 --> 00:33:59.253
That "life of things," that
phrase, that's Wordsworthian,

00:33:59.253 --> 00:34:01.569
a rich, simple phrase.
 

00:34:01.569 --> 00:34:06.809
She means by it the life of
things.

00:34:06.809 --> 00:34:12.147
Those things that have life in
that sense are not merely things

00:34:12.147 --> 00:34:16.710
but creations that are infused
with creative force.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:21.192
Artworks for Moore,
like God's creation,

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:27.054
carry a kind of burden of
acknowledgement to give us

00:34:27.054 --> 00:34:34.179
access to and honor the forces
that bring them into being.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.993
The really great poem,
I think, on this theme is "The

00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:43.412
Paper Nautilus."
And let me end our

00:34:43.412 --> 00:34:51.210
contemplation of Moore with this
poem on page 451.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:59.425
It suggests a way to understand
the specifically female artist

00:34:59.425 --> 00:35:05.465
that Moore is.
It's a kind of shell left

00:35:05.465 --> 00:35:12.770
behind that protects the eggs of
the sea animal,

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:16.190
the paper nautilus.
 

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:24.289
It's a beautiful object and I
wish I had the images of it to

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:29.387
show you.
She begins in this first stanza

00:35:29.387 --> 00:35:33.900
maybe a little confusingly by
saying:

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.966
In other words,
why does the paper nautilus

00:35:37.966 --> 00:35:42.130
make its beautiful art that is
its shell?

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:48.899
Does it do so for celebrity,
money, tea-time fame,

00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:52.630
the comfort of commuters?
 

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:58.125
No, no, none of these things,
none of these potential and

00:35:58.125 --> 00:36:01.070
base motives for making art.
 

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:07.349
No, the paper nautilus's shell
is something else:

00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:09.582
The shell is,
first of all,

00:36:09.582 --> 00:36:13.190
made not for popular or genteel
reasons.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:17.102
It is specifically a perishable
because all art,

00:36:17.102 --> 00:36:20.099
everything we make,
is perishable;

00:36:20.099 --> 00:36:23.090
it is a perishable "souvenir of
hope."

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:28.860
It's such a beautiful phrase,
"souvenir of hope."

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:36.460
It is a memory of our desire
and wish and aspiration for a

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:40.713
future.
This is what the shell holds

00:36:40.713 --> 00:36:44.067
and contains.
It's not immortal,

00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:47.570
it's material;
it's delicate and perishable.

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:52.318
It carries a memory of desire,
of hope that strives towards

00:36:52.318 --> 00:36:57.230
the future, and of a belief in
the worthiness of striving.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:02.425
It exemplifies the "love of
doing hard things," carries this

00:37:02.425 --> 00:37:05.773
into the future.
The shell is maternal,

00:37:05.773 --> 00:37:09.539
or the sign of the maternal,
let's say rather.

00:37:09.539 --> 00:37:13.980
It is a kind of shelter for the
future.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:19.110
It carries hope in the specific
form of the creature's eggs.

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:23.070
This, you could say,
is a kind of revision of the

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:26.699
earlier image of female power as
volcanic.

00:37:26.699 --> 00:37:31.286
Again, there's something inside
of great power,

00:37:31.286 --> 00:37:37.070
but it's another way of
rendering or imaging this power.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.912
And interestingly,
this creature,

00:37:40.912 --> 00:37:44.754
like the mountain,
is an octopus,

00:37:44.754 --> 00:37:51.958
viewed as if it were a poem or
as a kind of version of what a

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:56.824
poem is.
You could say that the shell

00:37:56.824 --> 00:38:01.373
Moore's writing about,
like a Moore poem,

00:38:01.373 --> 00:38:06.150
gives birth to images of heroic
action,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:10.067
and her poems are full of
heroic characters:

00:38:10.067 --> 00:38:13.530
some human, some,
many more, animal;

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.139
all of whom in certain ways,
like Hercules here,

00:38:17.139 --> 00:38:19.289
are "hindered to succeed."
 

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:22.061
And that's a wonderful and
interesting phrase,

00:38:22.061 --> 00:38:23.539
"hindered to succeed."
 

00:38:23.539 --> 00:38:28.870
I think it means "hindered to
succeed" in the sense of held

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:30.800
back or restrained.
 

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.796
But when something is
restrained in such a way,

00:38:34.796 --> 00:38:38.619
it is restrained in order that
it succeed;

00:38:38.619 --> 00:38:44.102
"hindered to succeed," in that
sense, restrained in order to

00:38:44.102 --> 00:38:47.539
succeed, to overcome its
hindrance,

00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:52.132
and to overcome its
self-imposed rules and

00:38:52.132 --> 00:38:58.965
guidelines or stanza forms in
order to produce the future that

00:38:58.965 --> 00:39:02.559
it dreams of.
Ultimately, those eggs,

00:39:02.559 --> 00:39:06.820
they free themselves and free
the shell at the same time.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:12.182
The shell in its freedom is a
model of the poem as a kind of

00:39:12.182 --> 00:39:16.320
autonomous object,
a thing that stands on its own

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:19.723
– impersonal,
taken away and apart from the

00:39:19.723 --> 00:39:23.699
maker.
It is strong and it's delicate.

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:29.585
It acknowledges and points to
the spiritual forces that made

00:39:29.585 --> 00:39:31.880
it or illuminated it.
 

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.680
"The Paper Nautilus" is
actively revising the famous

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:40.300
poem by Oliver Wendell Holmes
that I've given you a copy of,

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:46.554
"The Chambered Nautilus," which
celebrates the maker,

00:39:46.554 --> 00:39:51.485
you could say,
and the energy of the maker

00:39:51.485 --> 00:39:57.980
that moves on to its ever more
beautiful mansions.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:02.782
Moore celebrates,
rather, the made object,

00:40:02.782 --> 00:40:08.989
because it refers us back to
the process of making,

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:13.616
which is not a process of will
only but a process in which the

00:40:13.616 --> 00:40:18.721
will is hindered or restrained,
in which aspiration meets

00:40:18.721 --> 00:40:23.255
resistance.
Look at the final lines of the

00:40:23.255 --> 00:40:26.539
poem, they're very beautiful.
 

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:30.730
The shell is described as
having:

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:35.980
…wasp-nest flaws
of white on white, and close-

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:43.907
laid Ionic chiton-folds
And there she's seeing the

00:40:43.907 --> 00:40:47.860
white shell as if it were a
Greek marble.

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:53.440
And it puts her in mind of the
Elgin marbles that decorated the

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.862
Parthenon:
The shell is ultimately

00:40:57.862 --> 00:41:04.084
compared to a horse which has
lost its rider,

00:41:04.084 --> 00:41:11.579
whose arms no longer go around
it and restrain it.

00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:17.334
Well, there's an analogy
between the horse and an implied

00:41:17.334 --> 00:41:21.752
absent rider,
and the shell and the creature

00:41:21.752 --> 00:41:28.236
that was once inside it,
and the poem and the poet who

00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:31.902
wrote it.
Hope, here at the end of the

00:41:31.902 --> 00:41:35.104
poem, is renamed love,
a force imaged,

00:41:35.104 --> 00:41:38.219
again, through a kind of
silence,

00:41:38.219 --> 00:41:42.300
through its absence,
or rather through the traces of

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.696
its continuing presence,
which are the traces that we

00:41:47.696 --> 00:41:54.210
see in the strength and beauty
of the object which is,

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:59.010
I think, ultimately the
difference between silence and

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:03.540
restraint: that is,
love is present in the poem.

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.460
It's not merely silent.
 

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:10.650
It's present through its
restrained expression.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.580
And what remains in the poem,
in the shell,

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:20.288
and in the Parthenon horse is a
kind of acknowledgement of the

00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:25.809
spiritual forces that brought
these objects into being.

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:37.566
Well, we will go on and talk
about Moore's great peer,

00:42:37.566 --> 00:42:44.000
Wallace Stevens,
next week.

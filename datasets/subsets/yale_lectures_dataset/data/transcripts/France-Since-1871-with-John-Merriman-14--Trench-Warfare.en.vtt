00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.582
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, I want to talk about the

00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:11.066
war up through 1916 today,
and then followed by 1917 and

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:15.040
1918 on Wednesday.
On the last day of his life

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.126
Jean Jaurès was troubled
about what he was going to write

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:25.499
in L'Humanité,
the paper of the Socialist

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:32.342
Party, about whether workers of
France should go to war against

00:00:32.342 --> 00:00:36.480
workers of Germany,
and his decision,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.613
which for that matter had been
taken earlier anyway,

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:46.609
not just that evening,
reflects what is called the

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.281
sacred union,
union sacrée,

00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:55.790
that the political parties put
aside their differences in the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.762
war effort,
in the mobilization of the

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:03.899
total war that World War One
would become.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.963
And, so, he did,
he wrote an article with a

00:01:06.963 --> 00:01:09.590
headline called "En
Avant,"

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.070
"forward," or "let's go," and
he went out to eat in a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.378
café called Le Croissant,
which is still there,

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:22.055
it's not called Le Croissant
anymore, and he was having a

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.994
meal and about to go back to his
newspaper offices right near

00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:29.080
there--it's near the Boulevard
Montmartre,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.921
where a lot of the newspaper
offices still are--and a

00:01:32.921 --> 00:01:36.690
right-wing nut put a pistol
through from outside,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.069
through the curtain into the
restaurant, and blew him away.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.194
There was this tremendous sort
of turmoil in the street,

00:01:46.194 --> 00:01:51.013
and people who remembered it,
including the writer Roger

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:55.232
Martin du Gard,
remembered this sort of swell

00:01:55.232 --> 00:01:58.780
of chaos but also of
apprehension.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.356
In a sense it's easy to read
this backwards,

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:04.890
nostalgia, but the sense that
things would never be the same

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.901
again,
and Jaurès,

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.879
Jaurès,
Jaurès forever.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.520
And Jaurès died and the
world went to war.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.949
And the way the war started,
it started as if the--in the

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.379
way that the military planners
had wanted it to start.

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.419
I left you last time with the
Schlieffen Plan;

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.300
and Schlieffen literally on his
deathbed said that the last

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.834
German soldier,
his sleeve should touch the

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:39.829
Manche,
the English Channel,

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:44.693
and that in order to put France
into a headlock,

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:48.729
put Paris into a headlock like
that,

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.719
you should sweep this way,
through Belgium--they'd

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.379
eliminated the Netherlands as
part of that invasion route,

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.933
that would come in World War
II, but they didn't need the

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.622
Netherlands in this case--that
they would march into neutral

00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:03.026
Belgium,
neutral since 1831,

00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:08.985
knowing that this would bring
the British into the war because

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:13.772
the British could never have
Belgium occupied by a

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:19.781
potentially very hostile power.
And, so, Germany is under

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.842
pressure to win the war quickly.
They, as I said at the end of

00:03:24.842 --> 00:03:26.492
the last time,
last lecture,

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:30.037
they anticipated about two
weeks it's going to take the big

00:03:30.037 --> 00:03:32.910
Russian bear to bring all of
these forces,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.072
in many cases using that single
track railroad that went all the

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:42.337
way to Vladivostok,
to prepare to invade Germany,

00:03:42.337 --> 00:03:49.289
or to defend against German
incursions into Russia.

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:53.670
And, so, it was if--someone
once said, and I don't remember

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.976
who--as if Schlieffen's dead
hand automatically pulled the

00:03:57.976 --> 00:04:02.130
trigger when the Belgian
government on the 2nd of August

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.511
rejected German demands that its
armies could march through

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:10.249
Belgium.
And the Belgium Army fought

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:15.965
bravely, indeed very heroically,
against overpowering military

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:18.615
strength.
The big fortress of

00:04:18.615 --> 00:04:22.951
Liège--when I get so
close here I can't see--but

00:04:22.951 --> 00:04:28.412
Liège there falls,
and falls to the young--not so

00:04:28.412 --> 00:04:33.338
young, but--commander,
Ludendorff, after a huge

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:40.310
bombardment on the 16th,
followed by the fall of Namur.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.510
And once the Germans get
through the hills of eastern

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.279
Belgium then they move fairly
quickly.

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:56.195
But the German commander,
Von Moltke, m-o-l-t-k-e,

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:01.011
the younger Moltke,
uses some divisions to try to

00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:05.979
pin down the Belgians,
and he also is having doubts

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:10.949
with a view toward the home
front of wanting--of fearing how

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.162
far the French in their
inevitable penetration into

00:05:15.162 --> 00:05:19.904
Alsace-Lorraine would go.
And, so, indeed France advances

00:05:19.904 --> 00:05:24.048
in Alsace, although they had
been anticipated by Schlieffen

00:05:24.048 --> 00:05:28.621
as inevitable and not crucial to
the winning of the war in a very

00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:32.782
timely fashion,
now lead von Moltke to transfer

00:05:32.782 --> 00:05:37.893
troops, fearing that the home
front might despair of French

00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:41.990
advances there.
And, so, what this means is

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.289
that the Germans have basically
fewer troops than had been

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.310
anticipated in the original plan
by von Schlieffen.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.663
And sure enough the British
Expeditionary Force,

00:05:57.663 --> 00:06:04.156
which was not a large army,
finally arrives on the 20th of

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:07.459
August, Mons,
in Belgium.

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:12.754
But everybody is fairly sure
that the war is going to be over

00:06:12.754 --> 00:06:16.192
fairly soon.
But one of the things that

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:21.021
happens immediately--one of the
things that happens almost

00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:26.188
immediately is that the Germans
are marching so quickly and so

00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:30.678
rapidly that they become
fatigued by the pace of their

00:06:30.678 --> 00:06:33.933
march,
and also problems with

00:06:33.933 --> 00:06:36.686
communications.
And, indeed,

00:06:36.686 --> 00:06:42.419
the army--the army is commanded
by a forgettable guy called

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:47.560
Kluck-- is spread too thinly
across a wide front,

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.815
and that thinness made more
serious by the departure of

00:06:52.815 --> 00:06:58.096
troops to fight in Alsace,
and also by troops still left

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:03.649
in chasing down and rounding up
the Belgian forces in Belgium.

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:07.700
But he sends four divisions to
Russia, also,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.881
because the Russians have
advanced far more rapidly than

00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:18.500
he thought was ever possible.
And, so, one of the things that

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.278
the German High Command does is
instead of going all the way

00:07:23.278 --> 00:07:27.850
this way,
they turn down south and then

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:34.430
southeast, quicker than had been
originally planned.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.170
And despite huge losses,
on both sides,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.910
the German side and the French
side,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.297
and with the British also
getting into the action,

00:07:46.297 --> 00:07:51.490
the German forces are within
thirty-five miles of Paris,

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.464
thirty-five miles,
within Paris,

00:07:53.464 --> 00:07:56.329
so that you could hear the
cannon in Paris,

00:07:56.329 --> 00:08:01.670
from the fighting just east and
north of the capital.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.776
Now, if one wants an
explanation for how the French

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:09.389
home front was able to hold
spectacularly,

00:08:09.389 --> 00:08:12.739
through the entire war,
that is, one of two key

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:15.579
factors, and it's the most
important,

00:08:15.579 --> 00:08:20.067
is that the Germans are so
close to Paris that they can

00:08:20.067 --> 00:08:24.306
bombard Paris on Easter Sunday
1918--more about that

00:08:24.306 --> 00:08:29.691
later--with this huge gun,
Big Bertha as it was called by

00:08:29.691 --> 00:08:35.090
the English, firing way down
from up here in the north,

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.350
lobbying these huge shells all
the way.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:44.009
So, the pressure is there and
the response is heroic.

00:08:44.009 --> 00:08:46.468
The second factor,
which is often forgotten,

00:08:46.468 --> 00:08:48.641
is that the Sacred Union,
this Union

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:51.882
Sacrée,
is extremely effective in

00:08:51.882 --> 00:08:56.245
mobilizing through propaganda
but also through extremely

00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:59.189
intelligent action,
bringing help,

00:08:59.189 --> 00:09:02.701
for example,
to people trying to bring the

00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.990
harvest in, using troops,
and when they have them fairly

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.769
soon, capture German soldiers to
help bring the harvest in,

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:14.215
and they also begin to give
allocations familiales,

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:18.984
or sort of family allocations,
family resources I guess is a

00:09:18.984 --> 00:09:23.774
way of putting that,
to families who the departure

00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:26.702
of sons,
brothers, and fathers was

00:09:26.702 --> 00:09:28.688
catastrophic;
but, of course,

00:09:28.688 --> 00:09:32.979
they hadn't seen anything yet.
But they're very shrewd in

00:09:32.979 --> 00:09:37.460
this, and the home front,
unlike Berlin--and that's

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:42.747
another story--but the home
front in France holds throughout

00:09:42.747 --> 00:09:46.301
the entire war.
There are some exceptions in

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.320
that, and I'm going to talk
about that next week,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.340
and it's fairly--I mean on
Wednesday--it's fairly

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.906
interesting.
And, so, as the Germans are

00:09:55.906 --> 00:10:01.547
trying to drive to Paris in what
became known as the Battle of

00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:05.124
the Marne,
at the dawn of air warfare,

00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:08.818
planes--their first use was
reconnaissance,

00:10:08.818 --> 00:10:12.600
they're not used for--really as
weapons,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.785
in the very beginning.
There are attempts to drop

00:10:15.785 --> 00:10:19.159
small bombs and things like
that, and the French do this

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:21.884
fairly early on in Germany,
in German cities,

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:23.600
and the Germans do this as
well.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.808
But there's a guy flying around
up there who,

00:10:26.808 --> 00:10:30.600
a reconnaissance pilot,
who notices that Kluck's army

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.292
is changing directions,
leaving its flank open as it

00:10:35.292 --> 00:10:38.889
moves to a point southeast of
Paris.

00:10:38.889 --> 00:10:42.745
And, so, at that point the
French rush every conceivable

00:10:42.745 --> 00:10:45.480
soldier into the Battle of the
Marne,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.901
which takes place basically
between Lagny,

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:51.990
which is a town you can't see
here,

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.157
and Champagne,
basically in

00:10:54.157 --> 00:10:58.659
Châlons-en-Champagne,
the Battle of the Marne.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:00.795
And everybody knows this as a
famous story,

00:11:00.795 --> 00:11:03.490
and there's of course a metro
stop named after him,

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:06.797
inevitably, but the commander
of the military defense of the

00:11:06.797 --> 00:11:09.039
Paris Region is a guy called
Gallieni,

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:14.466
g-a-l-l-i-e-n-i,
and he conscripts the taxis of

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:17.658
Paris.
And, so, the Parisian taxis

00:11:17.658 --> 00:11:22.406
literally carry soldiers out to
fight in the Battle of the

00:11:22.406 --> 00:11:26.653
Marne, which can be clearly
heard, to repeat myself,

00:11:26.653 --> 00:11:29.449
in Paris;
that there was a sense of

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:31.210
impending doom,
obviously.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:37.700
But the miracle occurs and the
British pour through another gap

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:43.822
in the German armies further up,
along the Aisne River,

00:11:43.822 --> 00:11:50.230
a-i-s-n-e, and force them to
retreat forty miles back.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:55.615
And that's the largest exchange
of real estate that would occur

00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:59.350
until 1918, because of what
happens next.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.932
And on September 14th along the
Aisne River the Germans begin to

00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:08.919
fortify their position by
digging trenches,

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:14.043
and rather like the Battle of
Valmy in the French Revolution,

00:12:14.043 --> 00:12:19.265
in 1792, the sans-culottes,
that is the ordinary people who

00:12:19.265 --> 00:12:23.958
defended the revolution,
the Battle of the Marne saves

00:12:23.958 --> 00:12:28.120
Paris and without any question
saves France.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.821
So, then what you've got
is--and you have to--again I

00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.885
always give ridiculous sports
analogies since most of what I

00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:36.898
did over the weekend was watch
football--it works anyway in

00:12:36.898 --> 00:12:38.895
this case.
And what you have to do is

00:12:38.895 --> 00:12:41.539
imagine somebody trying to get
outside in a football game,

00:12:41.539 --> 00:12:46.189
Mike Hart or somebody trying to
get outside, and as the guards

00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:49.389
pull and as you move toward the
outside,

00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:51.592
the defense,
and above all the linebackers,

00:12:51.592 --> 00:12:53.480
and everybody kind of moves
along.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.279
And what you have basically is
you have a race to the sea.

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:59.532
They're trying to outflank each
other, where the Germans are

00:12:59.532 --> 00:13:02.730
going back to the strategy
penned by Schlieffen in 1905,

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.977
they're trying to get around to
go around, and then put this

00:13:06.977 --> 00:13:10.276
headlock.
And of course what the French

00:13:10.276 --> 00:13:15.462
and the British are doing is
they're racing along also to try

00:13:15.462 --> 00:13:18.790
to hold their ports,
the French ports,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:22.340
and also to keep them from
being outflanked.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.593
And, so, then you have the
famous Western Front--and

00:13:25.593 --> 00:13:28.909
that's--we're not talking about
the Eastern Front.

00:13:28.909 --> 00:13:31.307
There's a lot of good work done
recently on the Eastern Front,

00:13:31.307 --> 00:13:33.468
but you have this Western Front
that's generated so much

00:13:33.468 --> 00:13:36.411
magnificent literature,
some of which you're reading in

00:13:36.411 --> 00:13:39.688
Barbusse, as well as the
inevitable All Quiet on the

00:13:39.688 --> 00:13:42.419
Western Front by Erich Maria
Remarque,

00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:47.399
and Siegfried Sassoon,
and the British war poets.

00:13:47.399 --> 00:13:50.630
Now, there were a few
journalists--I can't remember if

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.470
I mentioned this or not--who had
followed the Russo-Japanese War

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.231
in 1904 and 1905,
and they had noticed that in

00:13:57.231 --> 00:14:00.299
some of these very prolonged
battles that trenches had been

00:14:00.299 --> 00:14:03.029
dug,
and in the mud and just

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:08.157
horribly bad weather,
that two forces stared across

00:14:08.157 --> 00:14:11.850
no-man's land against each
other.

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.529
And that's exactly what happens
in World War I;

00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.950
and that is,
to make a very long story,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.072
complicated story,
and sometimes overly-simplified

00:14:21.072 --> 00:14:24.345
story very short,
that's exactly what happens on

00:14:24.345 --> 00:14:27.700
the Western Front is that the
spade and the shovel,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.987
along with the machinegun,
which is a defensive weapon,

00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:36.592
along with ultimately gas and
flamethrowers--there were new

00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:40.799
ways of dying too--become the
weapons of the war,

00:14:40.799 --> 00:14:44.686
along with artillery,
and artillery kills more people

00:14:44.686 --> 00:14:48.669
than any other weapon,
followed by machineguns.

00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:52.591
And, so, basically,
as you can see from this map,

00:14:52.591 --> 00:14:56.840
that the trenches go all the
way from Switzerland,

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.017
literally, to the English
Channel, and that is where la

00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:06.649
jeunesse of France and these
other countries,

00:15:06.649 --> 00:15:08.378
where the youth,
the young men,

00:15:08.378 --> 00:15:11.030
and some older men,
too, of these countries,

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.851
died.
That was the end,

00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:19.455
where their short lives ended,
in the vast majority of the

00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:23.070
cases.
And attempts in the Fall of

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:28.732
1914 to break through simply
don't work, and it's not too

00:15:28.732 --> 00:15:32.980
hard to figure out why they
don't work,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.735
you don't have to be a
specialist in military warfare

00:15:35.735 --> 00:15:38.809
to know that if you're going to
break through like this,

00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:41.848
and you're going to--either
side, you pick your side and

00:15:41.848 --> 00:15:45.279
you're going to get across.
The question is how are you

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:48.958
going to do that?
Because by--very quickly the

00:15:48.958 --> 00:15:52.480
Germans have lines behind.
Here's from the point of view

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.106
of the French,
they're building railroads,

00:15:54.106 --> 00:15:56.904
they can supply.
And if you're going to go

00:15:56.904 --> 00:16:01.238
across and break through these
are sort of rubber band

00:16:01.238 --> 00:16:04.101
defenses,
and in order to break through

00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:07.864
with the strategy that they
adopt really throughout the war

00:16:07.864 --> 00:16:10.460
is what are called creeping
barrages,

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.128
is that with all of these tens
of thousands of cannons you have

00:16:15.128 --> 00:16:19.571
to soften up your opposition by
killing as many as people as

00:16:19.571 --> 00:16:21.643
possible.
So, you're shelling,

00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:24.048
you're anticipating where
you're going to go,

00:16:24.048 --> 00:16:27.000
and this of course tips off
your opponent and says,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.370
"ah-ha, that's where they're
going to go this time;

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.173
last time they went down there
and this time they're coming

00:16:32.173 --> 00:16:34.583
here."
And, so, all this does--anybody

00:16:34.583 --> 00:16:37.260
can see this,
and you'll see it in awhile,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:39.288
got live here,
or not so live,

00:16:39.288 --> 00:16:42.595
but we'll see it on your
screen--is that these creeping

00:16:42.595 --> 00:16:45.214
barrages,
besides killing lots of--the

00:16:45.214 --> 00:16:49.184
Americans invented the term
"friendly fire"--besides killing

00:16:49.184 --> 00:16:52.612
their own people,
but what they do is they create

00:16:52.612 --> 00:16:55.836
these enormous craters,
craters of death that are

00:16:55.836 --> 00:17:00.136
filled with just awful pestilent
waters and make it impossible to

00:17:00.136 --> 00:17:04.480
really get to the other side.
Because once you--once somebody

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.069
goes up and blows the whistle,
and says, "follow me,"

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:11.139
and you jump out of the
trenches, you've got to carry

00:17:11.139 --> 00:17:13.146
sixty pounds,
sixty pounds worth of

00:17:13.146 --> 00:17:16.452
equipment--now that's a lot of
equipment--down into these

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.458
things,
come through these craters,

00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:20.890
and then what you do is you
find these machine guns,

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.855
layers of them,
aimed right low,

00:17:22.855 --> 00:17:26.279
and they just take you out,
one right after another.

00:17:26.279 --> 00:17:29.454
I've been to the Imperial War
Museum in London various times,

00:17:29.454 --> 00:17:32.470
and I just went about six weeks
ago for the hell of it.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.395
They've made it--they've
really--it's not as good as it

00:17:35.395 --> 00:17:38.019
used to be.
But there used to be this one

00:17:38.019 --> 00:17:41.526
clip where you could see these
guys, these three guys,

00:17:41.526 --> 00:17:45.648
and one of them is an officer.
The officer has his whistle and

00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.523
he blows the whistle,
that is, en avant,

00:17:48.523 --> 00:17:51.212
here we go, let's go,
allez les gars,

00:17:51.212 --> 00:17:53.232
let's go guys.
And you see him,

00:17:53.232 --> 00:17:55.730
he gets one foot over there and
he's shot dead;

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.000
so you see his body slumped
down.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.318
You see the second guy,
you can imagine the terror in

00:18:01.318 --> 00:18:03.011
his eyes;
you can't see him,

00:18:03.011 --> 00:18:05.984
his eyes, you don't see him
very long because then he's

00:18:05.984 --> 00:18:09.617
killed to.
And then you see the third guy

00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:11.811
get over;
and you don't know what happens

00:18:11.811 --> 00:18:13.230
to him, his odds weren't very
good.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:18.251
But this is a story of the war.
Now, there's a vigorous

00:18:18.251 --> 00:18:21.150
historical debate always on did
they know what they were doing?

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.784
The image that you will see of
course in the movie,

00:18:24.784 --> 00:18:28.667
The Paths of Glory,
is that there they are drinking

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:31.884
champagne in somebody's
confiscated chateau and sending

00:18:31.884 --> 00:18:35.732
runners,
who were the people who carried

00:18:35.732 --> 00:18:41.500
messages to the trenches,
and organizing these attacks.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.041
And thus the most famous--just
killing fields,

00:18:45.041 --> 00:18:49.134
basically, of the war,
and there's some really famous

00:18:49.134 --> 00:18:52.395
ones like Paschendaele,
which is in Belgium,

00:18:52.395 --> 00:18:55.743
and when you go through this
idyllic sort of part of Belgium

00:18:55.743 --> 00:18:58.865
near Ypres you can't imagine
tens of thousands of people

00:18:58.865 --> 00:19:00.809
dying there,
poisoned.

00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:02.690
That's where the Germans first
used poison gas.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:06.416
Or the Somme is the obvious
example that everybody uses and

00:19:06.416 --> 00:19:10.760
I will use again in awhile.
Or the Battle of Verdun where

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:15.635
you're fighting a hand-to-hand,
hand-to-hand combat in the

00:19:15.635 --> 00:19:18.800
forts of Verdun that--and it
goes,

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.322
simply goes on, and on, and on.
And there's now the revisionist

00:19:23.322 --> 00:19:26.086
interpretations of the Battle of
Paschendaele--don't write down

00:19:26.086 --> 00:19:28.656
Paschendaele,
it's impossible to spell

00:19:28.656 --> 00:19:31.905
anyway--that,
say, well if they'd redefined

00:19:31.905 --> 00:19:34.690
the idea of the creeping
barrage,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.280
and if they'd managed to just
take one hundred yards,

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.421
and hold that,
and then the next one hundred

00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:41.160
yards,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:44.091
But increasingly--it was just
clear, it was obvious to the

00:19:44.091 --> 00:19:47.075
soldiers and it was clear to
most anybody that there wasn't

00:19:47.075 --> 00:19:49.720
going to be a breakthrough,
but the High Command,

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.420
the German High Command,
and the French High Command,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:56.720
and the British High Command
keep insisting that the next one

00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:00.089
will be the time we will truly
break through.

00:20:00.089 --> 00:20:02.856
But there isn't any
breakthrough until the Germans

00:20:02.856 --> 00:20:06.243
break through in the spring of
1918 and the bodies get higher

00:20:06.243 --> 00:20:08.623
and higher.
Now, on the Eastern Front,

00:20:08.623 --> 00:20:10.923
what you had,
some trench situations but

00:20:10.923 --> 00:20:13.990
basically it's a more wide-open
kind of fighting.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:17.774
There were so many people
killed that one of the Russian

00:20:17.774 --> 00:20:20.243
generals despaired,
he said, "we don't have any

00:20:20.243 --> 00:20:22.670
idea how many people were killed
because the bodies just stack up

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.059
so high we can't see anything
and it's impossible to guess."

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:28.636
On the Italian front,
on the Italian-Austrian front,

00:20:28.636 --> 00:20:32.575
Austro-Hungarian front,
there are ten different battles

00:20:32.575 --> 00:20:36.099
named after the same river,
the same small river.

00:20:36.099 --> 00:20:40.908
And, so, real estate is
exchanged in terms of yards,

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:46.565
not in terms of--it's won or
lost at the expense of all these

00:20:46.565 --> 00:20:51.279
lives in a matter of not
kilometers but yards;

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:56.176
and kilometers,
gains of a couple of kilometers

00:20:56.176 --> 00:21:02.029
are celebrated by the hysterical
press on both sides.

00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:05.765
And these are very old stories,
but it's still true that things

00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.898
appeared, for example--and the
French press had their

00:21:08.898 --> 00:21:11.910
counterparts elsewhere--that
French bodies that are

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.405
decomposing don't smell the way
that German bodies that are

00:21:15.405 --> 00:21:18.319
decomposing,
that was one story.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:22.044
Or that the German shells are
so badly made--the expression

00:21:22.044 --> 00:21:24.997
was Gerry-made,
that is an expression that came

00:21:24.997 --> 00:21:27.905
out of World War II also,
made by the Germans,

00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:29.996
because Gerries was a
derogative term for

00:21:29.996 --> 00:21:32.819
Germans--that they're just kind
of like playthings,

00:21:32.819 --> 00:21:34.957
they just kind of blow up and
go poof and that's the end of

00:21:34.957 --> 00:21:38.483
it, that they don't really kill.
And reports put in the civilian

00:21:38.483 --> 00:21:41.710
press about the hardy,
vigorous life of these

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:43.670
soldiers,
because they're in such good

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:45.907
shape, because they're eating
well--which was obviously not

00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:48.901
the case,
they're eating frozen potatoes,

00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:53.310
and when Pétain
increases the rum ration so they

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:58.373
could go over the top a little
tipsy to get killed in Verdun in

00:21:58.373 --> 00:22:00.343
1916.
So, there was this

00:22:00.343 --> 00:22:04.380
enormous--and this is one of the
scenes in the literature of the

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.392
war--there's this huge
discontinuity between the

00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:11.302
civilian life and the soldiers.
And the soldiers can't talk

00:22:11.302 --> 00:22:14.506
about it when they come back,
and they say things like,

00:22:14.506 --> 00:22:17.146
"what do they imagine?
That we jump up every morning

00:22:17.146 --> 00:22:19.140
and say, 'long live France,'
'long live Germany,'

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.221
'long live Italy'?"--depending
on your case--and jump over the

00:22:23.221 --> 00:22:25.630
top heroically in order to get
to,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.875
you name the city,
Moscow, Berlin,

00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:31.413
Paris, Saint Quentin,
wherever you want to talk about

00:22:31.413 --> 00:22:33.447
it.
And, so, there's discontinuity,

00:22:33.447 --> 00:22:36.461
the soldiers when they go on
leave, when the soldiers go back

00:22:36.461 --> 00:22:38.269
to the whorehouses of
Montmartre,

00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:42.385
or the bars of Montparnasse,
or anywhere else,

00:22:42.385 --> 00:22:46.226
or back to Lyon,
or Rennes, or anywhere you

00:22:46.226 --> 00:22:48.770
want,
it's impossible for them to

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.314
even discuss what has happened.
And, indeed,

00:22:51.314 --> 00:22:53.793
one of the interesting things
about this whole thing is lots

00:22:53.793 --> 00:22:55.809
of the really great literature
after the war,

00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:57.756
about the war,
does not come in the first two

00:22:57.756 --> 00:22:59.100
years.
Barbusse does,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.142
that's a fact,
I think he starts in the war,

00:23:02.142 --> 00:23:06.458
but All Quiet on the Western
Front isn't really written

00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:09.896
until late in the 1920s,
and then of course the Nazis

00:23:09.896 --> 00:23:12.718
try to keep it from being shown,
because it's obviously an

00:23:12.718 --> 00:23:18.819
anti-war film,
in German theaters.

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:21.979
So, in terms of--in 1914 you
could--these statistics,

00:23:21.979 --> 00:23:25.382
you could just give all these
statistics and you can read

00:23:25.382 --> 00:23:27.428
charts in any book,
including mine,

00:23:27.428 --> 00:23:30.066
and it's just--these are real
people, which is very hard--it's

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:31.840
an obvious thing to say but it's
hard,

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.129
the figures are so numbing.
By the end of 1914,

00:23:36.129 --> 00:23:39.564
so you're talking about half a
year, the British,

00:23:39.564 --> 00:23:43.428
the German and French forces
had combined casualties of

00:23:43.428 --> 00:23:47.292
300,000 killed--that's three
times the number of people

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:50.584
filling up the L.A.
Coliseum, or the Rose Bowl,

00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:55.023
or Michigan Stadium;
that's a lot of people--600,000

00:23:55.023 --> 00:23:57.785
wounded.
And these are in many cases

00:23:57.785 --> 00:24:01.627
just devastating wounds,
and so it's not so hard to

00:24:01.627 --> 00:24:06.098
imagine why the Paris metro,
and the subway in the 1920s was

00:24:06.098 --> 00:24:09.400
full of people begging with one
arm, or one leg,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.372
or no legs, or coughing out
their lungs because of gas

00:24:12.372 --> 00:24:14.611
attacked.
The British 7th Division

00:24:14.611 --> 00:24:18.598
arrived in France in October
1914 with four hundred officers

00:24:18.598 --> 00:24:21.841
and 12,000 soldiers,
after fighting around Ypres,

00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:25.220
which Ypres is right over the
Belgium border,

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.980
up by the English--not far away
from the English Channel;

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.306
a beautiful old textile town
that was destroyed for obvious

00:24:31.306 --> 00:24:34.584
reasons during the war.
They had four hundred officers

00:24:34.584 --> 00:24:37.769
and 12,000 soldiers,
four hundred officers,

00:24:37.769 --> 00:24:42.024
12,000 soldiers.
At the end, after eighteen

00:24:42.024 --> 00:24:47.653
days, they had forty-four
officers and 2,336 soldiers

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:50.729
left.
Figure out your odds,

00:24:50.729 --> 00:24:54.518
if you're eighteen,
nineteen, twenty,

00:24:54.518 --> 00:24:57.569
twenty-one, male,
in 1914.

00:24:57.569 --> 00:25:00.687
And there's a recent movie
which I can't remember the name

00:25:00.687 --> 00:25:04.213
of, my wife has seen it,
but it's about in 1914 there

00:25:04.213 --> 00:25:08.871
was an attempt on Christmas Day
for people to say "ça

00:25:08.871 --> 00:25:12.438
suffit largement";
this is just enough of this

00:25:12.438 --> 00:25:16.094
crap, let's sing to each other.
And the Welsh were singing

00:25:16.094 --> 00:25:18.766
their ballads,
and the Germans were singing

00:25:18.766 --> 00:25:22.011
doleful Lutheran hymns,
and the Catholic French were

00:25:22.011 --> 00:25:26.106
singing this and that.
And then somebody said,

00:25:26.106 --> 00:25:29.619
"well, let's play some
football."

00:25:29.619 --> 00:25:33.223
So, they got soccer players and
they're out playing and kicking

00:25:33.223 --> 00:25:35.307
the ball around.
Then they went back to try to

00:25:35.307 --> 00:25:37.588
kill each other again.
In 1915 a British soldier

00:25:37.588 --> 00:25:40.096
suggested, said,
"hey, let's do that again,"

00:25:40.096 --> 00:25:43.596
because he was lucky enough to
be around when they were doing

00:25:43.596 --> 00:25:45.793
it in 1914;
they put him up against the

00:25:45.793 --> 00:25:47.289
wall and shot him,
for treason.

00:25:47.289 --> 00:25:49.394
And one of the things that
happens during this,

00:25:49.394 --> 00:25:51.910
and because these people
were--everybody knows all these

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.538
stories.
You hear people dying,

00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:59.640
you hear them slowly expire,
between--in the craters,

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.253
between the trenches,
and so there are all these

00:26:02.253 --> 00:26:05.422
rumors that there are all these
people that had managed to

00:26:05.422 --> 00:26:08.980
survive with light wounds,
and that there was this huge

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.950
underground cavern where
Germans, and French,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.380
and British were all hanging
out,

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.005
and they were going out and
getting wine and champagne where

00:26:17.005 --> 00:26:19.570
they could find it,
and they were coming and taking

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.726
food rations,
and they were the smart ones

00:26:21.726 --> 00:26:25.577
because they were down there.
And it was the kind of rumor

00:26:25.577 --> 00:26:29.336
that just went on and on.
But the proximity of death and

00:26:29.336 --> 00:26:31.839
the proximity of the war was
always there.

00:26:31.839 --> 00:26:34.705
Again, another famous
example--if you were an officer

00:26:34.705 --> 00:26:38.067
in the British Army you could
have lunch in the Officer's Club

00:26:38.067 --> 00:26:41.184
at Victoria Station,
where many of you have been,

00:26:41.184 --> 00:26:45.157
and you could take the train to
the front and you could be dead

00:26:45.157 --> 00:26:48.258
by--in the same front,
you could be dead,

00:26:48.258 --> 00:26:52.420
fini, crevé,
by the end of the day.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:56.455
When Welsh miners tunneled
under this big promontory in

00:26:56.455 --> 00:27:01.163
Belgium, the explosion could be
heard across the English Channel

00:27:01.163 --> 00:27:03.590
in Kent.
The war was so close.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.275
That's what made it terrifying.
But that's what makes--also

00:27:07.275 --> 00:27:10.739
because the people lost people,
lost family,

00:27:10.739 --> 00:27:15.654
everybody lost family--that war
was the dominant experience of

00:27:15.654 --> 00:27:19.385
the twentieth century,
at least the first half of the

00:27:19.385 --> 00:27:23.067
twentieth century.
And again, you can look at the

00:27:23.067 --> 00:27:26.575
whole period,
1914 to 1945 as this long,

00:27:26.575 --> 00:27:31.251
horrible, thirty years war,
because the soldiers just

00:27:31.251 --> 00:27:35.789
simply kept marching.
But they weren't doing much

00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:40.839
marching in the trenches because
there wasn't anywhere to go.

00:27:40.839 --> 00:27:45.691
Your marching was running out
and hoping that you were somehow

00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:49.588
going to make it back,
after yet another "let's go

00:27:49.588 --> 00:27:51.771
over the top."
And to repeat,

00:27:51.771 --> 00:27:54.779
machineguns had first been
used--if I remember right they

00:27:54.779 --> 00:27:57.680
were called Gatling guns in the
American Civil War;

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:00.259
I think they were used at
Gettysburg, if I'm correct.

00:28:00.259 --> 00:28:04.556
They were slowly perfected,
at least to the level of World

00:28:04.556 --> 00:28:07.100
War One.
And they, after shelling,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.825
after these big shells
launching tens of thousands of

00:28:10.825 --> 00:28:14.909
shells--when they're softening
up the opponent as to where

00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:18.690
they're going to go;
these things go on for days.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.912
And that's where--the whole
syndrome of shellshock is a term

00:28:21.912 --> 00:28:25.062
that comes out of World War One,
too, because a lot of

00:28:25.062 --> 00:28:28.817
people--there are all sorts of
estimates about how many people

00:28:28.817 --> 00:28:32.509
really lost their mental
capacity because of all of this.

00:28:32.509 --> 00:28:35.545
But not only new ways of dying,
but new ways of just having

00:28:35.545 --> 00:28:38.320
your head exploding time,
and time, and time again;

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.970
living among dead bodies;
comrades who have disappeared;

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.340
rats, huge rats,
huge aggressive rats;

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.500
mice;
lice and everything else.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.152
And then there were
flamethrowers,

00:28:52.152 --> 00:28:57.136
and there are tanks--more about
tanks--tanks aren't any good at

00:28:57.136 --> 00:28:58.818
all,
basically, till 1917,

00:28:58.818 --> 00:29:01.638
because if you have a tank,
no matter--no tank can go over

00:29:01.638 --> 00:29:03.676
these craters,
they just get stuck in their

00:29:03.676 --> 00:29:06.240
whatever, not their wheels (I
don't know, you call them their

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.816
treads),
just sort of spin around and

00:29:08.816 --> 00:29:18.579
there they are.
And so there was new misery.

00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:21.805
You could send packages,
little care packages,

00:29:21.805 --> 00:29:26.319
to the soldiers with a little
cheese from the Ardèche,

00:29:26.319 --> 00:29:30.022
or a little cheese from Savoie
or maybe a bottle of wine from

00:29:30.022 --> 00:29:33.172
Burgundy or something like that,
and hoped it didn't get

00:29:33.172 --> 00:29:34.846
pilfered.
One soldier wrote back,

00:29:34.846 --> 00:29:38.019
"before you can have a drink
you have to chip away the ice.

00:29:38.019 --> 00:29:41.624
The meat is frozen and solid,
the potatoes are bonded by ice,

00:29:41.624 --> 00:29:45.289
and even hand grenades are
welded together in their cases."

00:29:45.289 --> 00:29:51.529
That's another weapon too that
comes up in World War One.

00:29:51.529 --> 00:29:55.401
A French soldier remembered,
"we all had on us the stench of

00:29:55.401 --> 00:29:57.575
dead bodies.
The bread we ate,

00:29:57.575 --> 00:30:01.638
the stagnant water we drank,
everything we touched had a

00:30:01.638 --> 00:30:04.680
rotten smell.
Death simply numbed."

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.880
An Austrian soldier--here's
some examples I took from the

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.710
other front, too,
but why not?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.792
A violinist wrote,
"a certain fierceness arises in

00:30:12.792 --> 00:30:16.754
you, an absolute indifference to
anything the world holds except

00:30:16.754 --> 00:30:20.227
your duty of fighting.
You're eating a crust of bread

00:30:20.227 --> 00:30:23.289
and a man is shot dead in the
trench next to you.

00:30:23.289 --> 00:30:25.887
You look at him calmly for a
moment and then you go on eating

00:30:25.887 --> 00:30:27.660
your bread.
Why not?

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.219
There's nothing to be done,
il n'y a rien à

00:30:30.219 --> 00:30:32.992
faire.
In the end you talk of your own

00:30:32.992 --> 00:30:37.004
death with as little excitement
as you would at a luncheon

00:30:37.004 --> 00:30:39.671
engagement."
A British--one of the war poets

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:42.686
wrote--I can't remember which
one, but the line sticks with

00:30:42.686 --> 00:30:44.712
you--he wrote,
"I didn't want to die,

00:30:44.712 --> 00:30:47.567
at least anyway until I'd
finished reading The Return

00:30:47.567 --> 00:30:50.675
of the Native."
And then he went on,

00:30:50.675 --> 00:30:54.410
and the dead filled up these
craters.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.046
Airplanes, just as an
insertion, as I said,

00:30:58.046 --> 00:31:01.250
were first used for
reconnaissance.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:08.829
Pilots carry pistols and fire
at their opponents;

00:31:08.829 --> 00:31:12.122
and again there was this sort
of esprit de corps that these

00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:15.188
were--so the brave fighting guys
up there are providing

00:31:15.188 --> 00:31:18.140
amusements for the people in the
trenches below,

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:20.667
and when one of the aces would
get shot down the other planes

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:24.610
would fly over and drop flowers,
and Baron von Richthofen and

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.452
all these big ace guys,
most of whom were killed in the

00:31:29.452 --> 00:31:31.489
end,
they get the good idea of

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:34.589
instead of putting a machinegun
on a plane that fires,

00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:37.536
and then they found that the
machinegun bullets are sent back

00:31:37.536 --> 00:31:40.089
killing the pilot by the
propeller-- someone says,

00:31:40.089 --> 00:31:41.680
"ah-ha, let's time it to the
propeller";

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.099
so they create ways,
they create bigger bombs that

00:31:44.099 --> 00:31:48.141
you can drop and all of that.
But air force planes are

00:31:48.141 --> 00:31:52.327
basically used for
reconnaissance planes,

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:56.200
and the war simply goes on and
on.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.494
One of the reasons why it goes
on and on, by the way,

00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:02.599
is that atrocity stories
on--that's not one of the

00:32:02.599 --> 00:32:05.758
reasons it goes on and on,
but it's one of the things that

00:32:05.758 --> 00:32:08.152
sort of would--if you're going
over the top again would give

00:32:08.152 --> 00:32:10.019
you some reason to want to go
over the top,

00:32:10.019 --> 00:32:13.189
besides simply trying to
survive and not wanting to be

00:32:13.189 --> 00:32:15.940
shot as a deserter,
is the atrocity stories.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.997
Of course for the Germans who
had--in the Franco-Prussian War

00:32:19.997 --> 00:32:22.429
there were some cases,
not very many,

00:32:22.429 --> 00:32:25.492
of them being gunned down by
civilians who were called

00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:28.006
franc tireurs,
just civilian sort of

00:32:28.006 --> 00:32:30.420
sharpshooters,
and the Germans go into the war

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:33.531
with a sense that they better
watch it because the Belgians

00:32:33.531 --> 00:32:36.589
are going to shoot you down from
buildings and so will the

00:32:36.589 --> 00:32:39.101
French.
Most of the atrocities on the

00:32:39.101 --> 00:32:42.990
western front were committed by
the Germans, not by the French.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.424
There were five hundred Belgian
civilians executed,

00:32:47.424 --> 00:32:50.839
most famously the nurse,
Edith Cavell,

00:32:50.839 --> 00:32:55.535
who is executed with a couple
of other people accused of

00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:58.569
treasons.
There were cases of rape

00:32:58.569 --> 00:33:03.426
perpetuated by German troops,
but rape had not yet become a

00:33:03.426 --> 00:33:09.599
weapon of war;
that would wait until later in

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:15.741
that very sad century.
But these stories passed very

00:33:15.741 --> 00:33:20.831
quickly and were seized upon by
propagandists on both sides,

00:33:20.831 --> 00:33:24.110
and that sort of keeps folks
going.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.840
Okay, now what about Verdun?

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.130
Anyway, this is from Verdun.
Now, Verdun,

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.210
why do the Germans go after
Verdun in 1916?

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:54.581
They know they're not going to
break through,

00:33:54.581 --> 00:33:59.410
but again it has ultimately to
do with that French birthrate,

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.535
is that they know,
because they have more

00:34:02.535 --> 00:34:06.990
children, they can afford to
lose more German soldiers;

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:11.714
that is, if you were German,
you guys, then the French,

00:34:11.714 --> 00:34:14.513
that is you guys,
or the British,

00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:19.150
you guys, if you were French or
you were British.

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:21.971
And by the way to say "guys,"
it's not at all to denigrate the

00:34:21.971 --> 00:34:24.894
role of women in the war,
more about that next lecture,

00:34:24.894 --> 00:34:27.319
to a great extent,
because that's extremely

00:34:27.319 --> 00:34:29.186
important,
because somebody had to step up

00:34:29.186 --> 00:34:30.409
in the factories and all of
that.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:33.240
But General Falkenhein,
the commander,

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:36.223
simply says,
"we will bleed them so that

00:34:36.223 --> 00:34:40.659
they will be forced to negotiate
and to sue for peace.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:44.183
They cannot afford to lose all
of the hundred thousands of

00:34:44.183 --> 00:34:46.469
people that we can afford to
lose."

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.485
So, the Battle of Verdun,
the town of Verdun,

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:54.410
in the Meuse,
northeast, you know from maps,

00:34:54.410 --> 00:34:58.699
itself was virtually destroyed
by shelling.

00:34:58.699 --> 00:35:01.620
And the forts of Verdun are off
to the north and to the east,

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.541
and there are two of them--the
names don't matter but they're

00:35:04.541 --> 00:35:06.720
interesting,
and someday you should go there;

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.416
Vaux, v-a-u-x is one;
and the other is called

00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:13.538
Douaumont, which may be the only
French commune that no longer

00:35:13.538 --> 00:35:17.460
exists.
Douaumont should be- d-u-- I

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.480
can't remember,
d-o-u-a-m-e-n-t;

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.966
anyway, it doesn't matter.
But one of the things when you

00:35:23.966 --> 00:35:26.676
go there you'll see these
plaques that people put up after

00:35:26.676 --> 00:35:28.605
the war,
and I think I mentioned this

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:31.064
the very first day,
and the hardest to take is one

00:35:31.064 --> 00:35:33.702
guy at Vaux he went up,
made a--in '21 or '22,

00:35:33.702 --> 00:35:36.427
a plaque that says,
"To my son, since his eyes

00:35:36.427 --> 00:35:38.849
closed mine have not ceased to
weep."

00:35:38.849 --> 00:35:42.624
And, so, the fighting in the
mists of these forests was some

00:35:42.624 --> 00:35:46.398
of the worst ever seen in any
war and would take hundreds of

00:35:46.398 --> 00:35:48.780
thousands of lives,
as you know.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.538
This is--remember the stuff
about the craters,

00:35:51.538 --> 00:35:54.971
this is an aerial view of Fort
Douaumont, the area around

00:35:54.971 --> 00:35:57.239
there, and those are all
craters.

00:35:57.239 --> 00:36:00.179
It looks like it's your classic
lunar landscape.

00:36:00.179 --> 00:36:04.311
This is the south entrance to
the Fort of Douaumont,

00:36:04.311 --> 00:36:08.200
which has just been destroyed
by German shelling,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.153
as you can see.
And here you have--these are

00:36:12.153 --> 00:36:14.353
the entrance.
You can go, as a tourist you

00:36:14.353 --> 00:36:16.470
can go right into there.
These are not where these

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.227
plaques are all put up around
here, like they're inside a

00:36:19.227 --> 00:36:22.389
church.
That's what it looked like then.

00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:25.069
You can see the mont
left from Douaumont,

00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:27.520
there, the Douau is
ça n'en existe

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.630
plus, it's not there
anymore.

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:33.021
And as a matter of fact when
you go to where the commune was,

00:36:33.021 --> 00:36:36.130
the shelling is such that there
are these huge hills;

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:41.077
enormous hills have been
created simply by this land

00:36:41.077 --> 00:36:45.539
being blown apart,
and that you're in--this,

00:36:45.539 --> 00:36:48.187
you lived in the fort as you
lived in these trenches,

00:36:48.187 --> 00:36:50.421
and the trenches were,
as the forts,

00:36:50.421 --> 00:36:55.014
are accommodated as best they
can to make things livable for

00:36:55.014 --> 00:37:00.574
those who are about to die.
And here is an infirmary where

00:37:00.574 --> 00:37:05.090
you have your instant
amputations, there.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:10.486
And that's what it looked like;
and you've seen pictures of the

00:37:10.486 --> 00:37:13.619
Somme, which I'll talk about
maybe next time a little bit.

00:37:13.619 --> 00:37:19.070
They had to build these
walkways to get you over all of

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.284
the mud.
And the weather in northern

00:37:21.284 --> 00:37:24.139
France, whether you're talking
about Boulogne or anywhere else,

00:37:24.139 --> 00:37:26.801
anywhere in the Channel but all
the way really into the northern

00:37:26.801 --> 00:37:28.940
part of Alsace,
is pretty dreadful.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.530
And here again are these
craters.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:34.180
You've going to carry sixty
pounds through that stuff?

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:37.292
Not very easy.
And barbed wire,

00:37:37.292 --> 00:37:42.326
which I should have mentioned
also, is one of those defensive

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.347
weapons of war,
along with your basic

00:37:45.347 --> 00:37:47.463
machinegun.
And, of course,

00:37:47.463 --> 00:37:50.353
one of the things that adds to
the weight carried by each

00:37:50.353 --> 00:37:53.191
soldier is you had to have
barbed wire clippers that are

00:37:53.191 --> 00:37:55.719
going to succeed in cutting the
barbed wire.

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:57.230
And the war poets,
one of them,

00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:59.646
I can't remember,
maybe it was Isaac Rosenberg or

00:37:59.646 --> 00:38:02.164
one of them said that,
well, "where's the finest of

00:38:02.164 --> 00:38:03.905
Devonshire?
They're hung up,

00:38:03.905 --> 00:38:06.229
they're hung up,
hung up on that old barbed

00:38:06.229 --> 00:38:09.605
wire"--because it was easy to
get caught up on the barbed wire

00:38:09.605 --> 00:38:13.863
and simply perish there.
And there's your basic real

00:38:13.863 --> 00:38:17.936
live trench, with the helmets.
The French troops,

00:38:17.936 --> 00:38:21.300
by the way, who'd gone into the
war wearing--this is true,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:27.174
I couldn't invent this--bright
red pants that could be seen

00:38:27.174 --> 00:38:33.150
through the mists by troops
changed to more subtle colors by

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:37.760
the end of the war,
to give them a better chance.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.864
And, so, that was the trench,
and when you were going to

00:38:40.864 --> 00:38:43.969
attack what you would do is
climb up over the trench,

00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:48.467
and then face this machinegun
fire, and get as far as you

00:38:48.467 --> 00:38:52.444
could.
Many did not get very far at

00:38:52.444 --> 00:38:55.544
all.
And there is--get your head

00:38:55.544 --> 00:38:59.070
down and hope it doesn't land on
you.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.382
That's how most people died,
the majority of people died

00:39:02.382 --> 00:39:04.971
through shelling,
in these kinds of creeping

00:39:04.971 --> 00:39:09.022
barrages or just basic shelling.
Sharpshooters were also a

00:39:09.022 --> 00:39:10.913
problem.
That's how--many of you have

00:39:10.913 --> 00:39:13.513
read All Quiet on the Western
Front, and that's how he

00:39:13.513 --> 00:39:16.947
gets killed at the end,
because he puts his head up and

00:39:16.947 --> 00:39:20.676
someone blows it away.
But generally they used these

00:39:20.676 --> 00:39:24.500
kind of periscopes to look up
and to survey the scene.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:27.475
And if you went out into the
trenches it was--went out at

00:39:27.475 --> 00:39:30.929
night as reconnaissance patrols,
and that was pretty dangerous.

00:39:30.929 --> 00:39:34.086
Or, if you were particularly
heroic, and many of these people

00:39:34.086 --> 00:39:38.050
in the infirmary service were,
you went out to try to bring

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.900
back the wounded before they
died.

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:45.041
And that's what--you have to
imagine this as being everything

00:39:45.041 --> 00:39:47.940
from Switzerland to the English
Channel.

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:51.590
And there they are preparing
grenades.

00:39:54.719 --> 00:39:57.371
Again, a lot of people in
France and in Germany are

00:39:57.371 --> 00:39:59.440
hunters and they're used to
shooting,

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.517
but the idea of throwing a
grenade, there's not--there

00:40:02.517 --> 00:40:04.840
weren't sports in France then--I
mean,

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.736
this is a lame,
and I apologize for this lame

00:40:06.736 --> 00:40:08.719
analogy, but the idea of
throwing a grenade;

00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:11.477
Americans throw baseballs and
stuff like that,

00:40:11.477 --> 00:40:14.971
but it was--even that gesture
of throwing something took a

00:40:14.971 --> 00:40:20.255
little of getting used to.
But here they are getting ready

00:40:20.255 --> 00:40:22.340
to go again.
An incoming.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.737
Going out at night.
And the other thing,

00:40:31.737 --> 00:40:33.453
if you went out at night,
you couldn't see,

00:40:33.453 --> 00:40:35.619
that was part of it,
because you couldn't be seen.

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:38.866
And, of course,
that's where you can get hung

00:40:38.866 --> 00:40:43.589
up on barbed wire that you don't
know or encounter another patrol

00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:47.153
from the other side.
And they tried to fool each

00:40:47.153 --> 00:40:51.203
other to get people that grew up
in Alsace to speak German and

00:40:51.203 --> 00:40:54.676
all of that.
And there's of course a

00:40:54.676 --> 00:41:00.383
machinegun in placement,
the second big way of getting

00:41:00.383 --> 00:41:02.938
killed.
Go there sometime,

00:41:02.938 --> 00:41:08.030
go into Vaux and Douaumont and
try to imagine what it's like.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.599
It must have been just
something.

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:13.409
And also the weather is
so--it's heavy weather so they

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:16.708
were dressed rather heavily.
These are sort of binocular

00:41:16.708 --> 00:41:21.350
type things there.
And, well, voilà.

00:41:24.449 --> 00:41:26.466
And that's sleeping
accommodations,

00:41:26.466 --> 00:41:29.776
such as you would find.
If you look at that you could

00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:33.178
also imagine being in a
submarine, because much of this

00:41:33.178 --> 00:41:36.017
is underground there.
And then that's where you

00:41:36.017 --> 00:41:38.937
slept, and you tried to figure
out who didn't come back,

00:41:38.937 --> 00:41:41.380
after the--when the night
patrol came back.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.128
The telephone systems,
the Germans had a huge

00:41:44.128 --> 00:41:47.940
advantage in the east because
the Russian telephone system,

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.032
they'd managed to figure out
how it worked so they could hear

00:41:50.032 --> 00:41:52.940
every single call,
if they were within range.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:58.389
But the French system worked
better.

00:41:58.389 --> 00:42:00.710
And also we're dealing with
telegraphs.

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:05.493
This is modern warfare.
What made it total warfare was

00:42:05.493 --> 00:42:10.193
the mobilization of an entire
society, of its productive

00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:14.124
capacity, to fight this war on,
and on, and on,

00:42:14.124 --> 00:42:16.081
and on.
And, of course,

00:42:16.081 --> 00:42:19.558
how the war ends with the
German troops way inside France

00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:23.408
will have enormous repercussions
for the poisoning of the 1920s

00:42:23.408 --> 00:42:25.417
and 1930s,
because it became easy for

00:42:25.417 --> 00:42:27.281
Hitler to say--and for other,
he was just one,

00:42:27.281 --> 00:42:29.270
there were lots of rightwing
leaders--to say,

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.760
"we were winning the war.
How did we lose it?

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:35.598
We were inside France.
We were stabbed in the back,

00:42:35.598 --> 00:42:38.323
by who?
The Jews, the Communists,

00:42:38.323 --> 00:42:40.588
the Socialists,
the weak ones,

00:42:40.588 --> 00:42:45.198
not part of the true national
Volkish community," et cetera,

00:42:45.198 --> 00:42:48.923
et cetera.
And bringing somebody back--I'm

00:42:48.923 --> 00:42:52.382
sorry to say the man looks a
little peaked,

00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:56.218
hauling him back.
And these are armed soldiers,

00:42:56.218 --> 00:42:59.010
so this is not your infirmary
group.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.908
There was some respect of the
Red Cross insignia and the white

00:43:03.908 --> 00:43:06.960
flag, people tended to respect
that.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:10.010
And also across--there were
these images.

00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:12.824
In a place called Albert,
like Albert,

00:43:12.824 --> 00:43:16.780
a town in the Somme that was
completely destroyed,

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:20.293
there was a statue of the
Virgin Mary, on top of a church,

00:43:20.293 --> 00:43:24.497
and it was hit by a shell,
and it was hanging by a thread,

00:43:24.497 --> 00:43:27.773
and soldiers on both sides
could see that,

00:43:27.773 --> 00:43:30.889
the Virgin Mary hanging by a
thread,

00:43:30.889 --> 00:43:33.294
and every day people think it's
going to get hit again,

00:43:33.294 --> 00:43:36.376
and it's going to fall down.
And it became--that too became

00:43:36.376 --> 00:43:39.927
sort of a myth about if it falls
it's going to sign--show that

00:43:39.927 --> 00:43:42.429
France is going to lose and all
of that.

00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:47.667
And a lot of these towns like
Arras and Reims--that's how the

00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:50.763
Cathedral of Reims,
which is one of the great

00:43:50.763 --> 00:43:52.682
cathedrals in Europe,
or anywhere else,

00:43:52.682 --> 00:43:55.310
was destroyed because they're
right on the front,

00:43:55.310 --> 00:43:59.458
right on the front.
And again infirmary,

00:43:59.458 --> 00:44:02.470
there's infirmary guys there.

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:09.749
And I don't know what these
people--oh, they're distributing

00:44:09.749 --> 00:44:11.850
water, that's what they're doing
they're distributing water.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:17.850
Getting ready to go.
Charge over that.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:25.761
The ones who didn't make it.
There's still a whole trench

00:44:25.761 --> 00:44:28.614
with bayonets sticking up that
they more or less left the way

00:44:28.614 --> 00:44:30.205
it was.
You can see that too,

00:44:30.205 --> 00:44:33.707
they removed the bones.
And that's a night patrol going

00:44:33.707 --> 00:44:36.150
out, crawling over those
craters.

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:39.210
It gives you a pretty good idea.
See the movie.

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:43.590
The explosions,
voilà.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.281
That last one,
by the way, was simply called

00:44:46.281 --> 00:44:49.159
Verdun Hell,
which is the way it was.

00:44:49.159 --> 00:44:54.032
So, we're going to pass on to
not necessarily more cheery

00:44:54.032 --> 00:44:58.678
subjects next time,
but we'll talk about why 1917

00:44:58.678 --> 00:45:03.149
was the big year,
and talk about the end of the

00:45:03.149 --> 00:45:04.909
war,
and what all that meant.

00:45:04.909 --> 00:45:08.857
And, again, to discuss the
impact of all of this on French

00:45:08.857 --> 00:45:11.000
society.
See you Wednesday.

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:04.600
PAUL FREEDMAN: OK, so Islam,
Part Two.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:12.667
I know there's a lot of new
terminology, new narratives.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:18.400
The things that I want you to
keep in mind are what we're

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.033
really going to focus on today
and that is the Islamic

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:28.167
conquests, which certainly take
place partly because of

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:32.967
religious motivation, but
nevertheless are not

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:38.200
accompanied by some fanatical
desire to convert the world.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.333
The Muslim conquests have to
be understood in terms of

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.467
religious motivation but not in
terms of a determination to

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.467
wipe out Judaism and
Christianity.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:55.133
What appears to be a paradox
makes this era a little hard

00:00:55.133 --> 00:00:56.133
to understand.

00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:00.067
Namely, the paradox being that
you would have such a rapid

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.667
expansion of the Arabs and the
religion that they carried,

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:08.700
which eventually would extend
from Spain to India.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:17.533
And at the same time that the
Islamic population would be a

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.133
minority in most of those

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:23.267
conquered regions for centuries.

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:29.167
There is not a demand for the
conversion of the population

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:32.667
to Islam, and that although
the conversion does take

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:38.533
place, in many, in most parts
of this imperial caliphate.

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.367
It doesn't take place
immediately and it doesn't

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.667
take place under
great pressure.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:46.167
I say apparent paradox because,
in fact, the two

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:47.633
things are different.

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:53.300
The motivation provided by the
religion to conquer does not

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.800
necessarily mean that you
require that everybody that

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.167
you conquer embrace
the religion.

00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:03.133
Indeed, in part, this is
because, as Berkey emphasizes,

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:10.133
the distinctiveness of the
religion was worked out over

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:12.633
the course of its first century,
beginning as we said

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:16.733
last time in Medina but not
fully articulated until the

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:22.600
change of dynasty in 750 from
the Umayyad to the Abbasids.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400
But the other reason is that
there's no logical connection

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.933
between conquest
and conversion.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:32.933
It's perfectly possible to be a
motivated conqueror and not

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:35.900
to require that other people
embrace your religion and this

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.933
is for reasons that we'll see.

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:42.267
The other apparent paradox, and
here I think there really

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:45.367
is a paradox, is that the
Islamic conquests are

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:47.267
accompanied by internal
division within

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:53.300
Islam from 650 AD.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.800
By the time of the Abbasid
succession, it is a century

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.667
later these two parties
can be identified

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:00.900
as Sunni and Shiite.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.300
And you've read that and
you're aware that this

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.733
continues to be a division that
defines an awful lot of

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.200
the Islamic world today.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.033
It is particularly a problem
in those countries such as

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:17.067
Iraq, for example, that have
both Sunni and Shiite

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:18.167
populations.

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:24.733
It's not a problem in Morocco
where everybody is Sunni.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:30.767
And it is less of a problem in
contemporary Iran where a very

00:03:30.767 --> 00:03:33.167
large majority is Shiite.

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:40.867
But it is a problem that
defines both Islam as a

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:44.300
religion and the politics of
many countries to this day.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.967
And so one of the things we
have to talk about in a

00:03:46.967 --> 00:03:50.467
lecture entitled "Islamic
Conquest and Civil War" is the

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:52.833
origins of the split
within Islam.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:56.967
The paradox is that the
conquests keep on going even

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:59.167
while it would seem
that religious

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:00.467
unity is falling apart.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:10.400
Now as you remember, I hope,
after Mohammed's death, there

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.233
was no clear succession.

00:04:12.233 --> 00:04:15.600
He didn't have a son, and it
wasn't clear what anyone would

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.333
succeed to.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.800
If he was the seal of the
prophets, then you couldn't

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.233
succeed to prophecy.

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:27.933
Was he a religious ruler, was he
a military ruler, was he a

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.167
judicial arbitrator?

00:04:31.433 --> 00:04:35.000
His father-in-law, Abu Bakr,
who we saw was one of the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.867
first of his followers, was
elected caliph--, caliph

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:43.200
meaning "successor," simply.

00:04:46.567 --> 00:04:49.967
Succeeding to what was not
defined, but to some kind of

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:54.033
combination of religious
and secular rule.

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:57.467
As we said last time, religious
and secular rule

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:01.900
are, in a fundamental way, not
separated in Islam, although

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.667
as we're going to start to see
and as you've read, there are

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:09.033
some ways in which they do
start to separate out,

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:15.133
particularly in the later
Abbasid period.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.833
Abu Bakr was elected, that is
the followers of Mohammed, the

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:24.233
people who were thought to have
some sort of original

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:26.100
religious authority,
elected him.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.933
His rival was Ali, the cousin
of Mohammed and the

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:34.500
son-in-law, at the same
time of Mohammed.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.633
Ali had married Fatima, the
daughter of Mohammed.

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.267
But this election was not
recognized by many of the

00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:48.200
tribes that had regarded their
loyalty to Mohammed as

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.500
personal loyalty to Mohammed,
not to some institution and

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.167
not to some permanent coterie
of caliphs or successors.

00:06:00.167 --> 00:06:04.700
So they refused to recognize Abu
Bakr's authority and there

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.467
ensued what's called the ridda,
R-I-D-D-A, or apostasy

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:15.467
, where the tribes rejected the
authority of Abu Bakr and

00:06:15.467 --> 00:06:20.933
Abu Bakr militarily compelled
them back into submission or

00:06:20.933 --> 00:06:23.233
recognition of his authority.

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:27.867
Abu Bakr ruled for less than two
years, but he had already

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:35.100
started on a key aspect of the
ridda, the apostasy , and,

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.033
that is, turning the resistance
to the apostasy

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:41.533
into a war against
external enemies.

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:45.933
In other words, the military
energy that had to be devoted

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:49.133
to bringing these tribes back
in, once they were brought in,

00:06:49.133 --> 00:06:53.667
was continued to turn their
military energies outward.

00:06:53.667 --> 00:06:59.100
And outward means to the north,
out of the Arabian

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.733
desert and to the direct north
and slightly northeast,

00:07:03.733 --> 00:07:06.700
meaning Persia, to the
northwest meaning the

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.067
Byzantine Empire.

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:15.133
And already under Abu Bakr ,
it was discovered that the

00:07:15.133 --> 00:07:18.267
Byzantine Empire and the Persian
Empire were hollowed

00:07:18.267 --> 00:07:22.267
out and that what began
as raids to keep these

00:07:22.267 --> 00:07:28.133
discontented tribes happy with
a spot of plunder turned into

00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:32.067
a conquest. And as success
breeds success,--

00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:35.000
and I don't think there's
anymore dramatic lesson of

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.433
that cliche,--

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:40.000
the ambitions of the conquerors
changed very

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.833
quickly; well the ambitions of
the raiders changed very

00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:49.533
quickly, from booty to conquest,
from plunder to an

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:50.767
expansion of territory.

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:58.833
Remember that the Persians and
the Byzantines had fought each

00:07:58.833 --> 00:08:03.767
other, that in 626 Persia
besieged Constantinople

00:08:03.767 --> 00:08:05.433
unsuccessfully--

00:08:05.433 --> 00:08:08.533
626, four years after
the Hegira.

00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:11.800
So from the Islamic/ Muslim/
Arab point of view,

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.167
the timing was great.

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:16.067
These two great empires had
exhausted each other

00:08:16.067 --> 00:08:19.400
militarily and to some extent
spiritually as well.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.833
In 634, in other words two
years after the death of

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:32.633
Mohammed, the city of Damascus
fell to the Arabs.

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:37.967
Damascus, the capital of
Byzantine Syria, indeed one of

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:41.000
the oldest cities in the world,
mentioned in the Old

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.900
Testament of the Bible, an
extremely important center of

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:54.333
government, commerce,
and religion fell.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:57.500
The Byzantine Empire was
defeated near Jerusalem.

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:05.467
Abu Bakr died in 634 and again
Ali was passed over in another

00:09:05.467 --> 00:09:10.633
election in favor of another
companion of Mohammed, Umar,

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:16.033
another one of those original
followers that we mentioned in

00:09:16.033 --> 00:09:17.767
the last lecture.

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:20.400
Umar would rule from
634 to 644.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.967
He was a startlingly
effective ruler.

00:09:23.967 --> 00:09:28.167
In the ten years of his
caliphate, the Arabs conquered

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:31.200
the Persian Empire entirely.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.233
An empire that had lasted for
centuries, that had been one

00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:45.667
of the great world empires,
collapsed and was taken over

00:09:45.667 --> 00:09:47.833
by Islam, by the Arabs.

00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:53.433
The Byzantine Empire didn't
completely collapse, but in

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:57.833
this period it lost Syria,
Palestine, and then its

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:02.767
richest agricultural
province, Egypt.

00:10:02.767 --> 00:10:05.967
Alexandria, capitol of
Egypt at the time,

00:10:05.967 --> 00:10:10.533
surrendered in 642.

00:10:10.533 --> 00:10:15.033
We can list the factors that
favor the Arab conquest,

00:10:15.033 --> 00:10:19.533
though they're mostly sort of
favorable soil, as it were,

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:22.133
not the plant itself.

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:23.567
Weakness of Persia
and Byzantium,

00:10:23.567 --> 00:10:25.600
I've already mentioned.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.233
A mastery of desert warfare.

00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:32.233
We'll see this with
the Vikings at

00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:33.267
the end of the course.

00:10:33.267 --> 00:10:36.433
There are peoples who have been
able to take advantage of

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:39.800
an adverse environment that they
are able easily to swim

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:48.600
through, travel through, and
that a less mobile adversary

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.167
cannot deal with.

00:10:50.167 --> 00:10:55.267
So the similarity between the
sea and the rivers of Europe

00:10:55.267 --> 00:11:00.533
and the desert of the Near East
is that you can pick and

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:01.967
choose your battles.

00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:04.467
You appear off the
coast. "Uh oh.

00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:05.567
There's an army there.

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:08.633
We'll just go back and then
we'll raid somewhere else."

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:10.100
The same is true
of the desert.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.967
You appear out of the desert
where the urban dwellers

00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:16.500
cannot easily field an army.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.000
And you discover that there's
nobody defending the city and

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.567
you take it.

00:11:19.567 --> 00:11:22.133
Or you discover there is
somebody defending the city.

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:23.167
You go right back into the

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:25.033
desert; they can't pursue
you there and you

00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:26.533
pick somewhere else.

00:11:26.533 --> 00:11:29.800
So the mastery of desert warfare
is in part a question

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:36.133
of mobility and the ability
to move in the

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:39.833
desert freely, easily.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:44.267
Another aspect of the weakness
of Persia and Byzantium is the

00:11:44.267 --> 00:11:47.400
discontent of their religious
minorities.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.033
Persia was ruled by a
Zoroastrian elite and had

00:11:50.033 --> 00:11:54.500
other religious groups that
felt, if not persecuted, at

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.467
least discriminated against.
And as we've seen, the

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.867
Byzantine Empire had a
substantial Monophysite

00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:04.967
population that was persecuted
by the orthodox.

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:10.633
These people might not exactly
fight for the invader but they

00:12:10.633 --> 00:12:14.400
certainly weren't unhappy when
the invader showed up.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.533
Indeed, remember that
I said that in 655,

00:12:18.533 --> 00:12:21.733
there was a naval battle.

00:12:21.733 --> 00:12:26.333
How could the Arabs have sailors
if they hadn't seen a

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:32.700
year-round river until a few
years before this battle?

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:37.400
Their sailors were, most of
them, from Monophysite

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.533
populations of Egypt
and Syria.

00:12:39.533 --> 00:12:42.200
They were able to recruit people
who would fight for

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.933
them who were not Muslim.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:50.667
The third is the channeling of
a war-like society towards

00:12:50.667 --> 00:12:51.900
external fighting.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.467
This is like a problem of
conservation of energy.

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:03.700
You have a certain amount of
energy that is being expended

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.267
in external fighting.

00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:09.000
If you can turn all those
electrons or whatever in the

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.767
same direction and make them
go outward, they will be

00:13:13.767 --> 00:13:15.367
extremely powerful.

00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:19.200
Limits of my scientific
knowledge, unfortunately, you

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.033
see displayed.

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:22.333
But you understand what
I'm talking about.

00:13:22.333 --> 00:13:25.667
That is, the internecine warfare
is now turned outside

00:13:25.667 --> 00:13:28.267
because the plunder is better,
the motivation is better.

00:13:28.267 --> 00:13:32.467
And then motivation is
a fourth reason.

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:37.533
Religious motivation is this
thing that is called jihad.

00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:39.467
Everybody knows what
this means.

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:43.600
And we're going to have to
grapple with it because our

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.433
understanding of it is perhaps
partial and distorted.

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:52.400
Jihad means struggle.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.333
It is a struggle against other
religions or against other

00:13:58.333 --> 00:14:00.133
tendencies within Islam.

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:05.733
There's plenty of energy, as we
will see, devoted to fights

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:07.133
within Islam.

00:14:07.133 --> 00:14:13.333
Internecine religious fighting
if not tribal feuding.

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:17.033
So we use the term jihad
with some reservations.

00:14:17.033 --> 00:14:23.100
It is wrong to think of the Arab
conquest as an expression

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:27.133
of jihad in the sense that
guys with knives in their

00:14:27.133 --> 00:14:33.700
teeth ride out and offer a
terrorized population the

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.933
choice of death or conversion.

00:14:36.933 --> 00:14:43.033
Once again, it is possible to
have a religious motivation

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:48.433
and yet not necessarily want
to kill or convert the

00:14:48.433 --> 00:14:49.900
conquered people.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.700
The Quran itself has plenty of
information about the jihad

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.467
but it is not completely
consistent.

00:14:58.467 --> 00:15:01.967
Certainly there is
a sense that the

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:05.167
unbelievers must be combated.

00:15:05.167 --> 00:15:09.467
A sense of martyrdom even--
that those who died in the

00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:11.933
struggle to advance
the religion will

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:15.667
receive special favor.

00:15:15.667 --> 00:15:20.700
But there is also a respect
accorded to people of other

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.300
religions, in particular,
Jews and Christians.

00:15:27.233 --> 00:15:30.367
And if you think about it, it is
psychologically possible to

00:15:30.367 --> 00:15:34.667
be convinced that God
is following you.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:35.933
God must be following you.

00:15:35.933 --> 00:15:39.267
After all, you just conquered
Jerusalem, you just conquered

00:15:39.267 --> 00:15:44.567
Alexandria, you just came out of
the desert and have started

00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:48.400
to a roll like a tsunami- an
image I don't think is really

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.267
in the Quran.--

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:53.567
Well, let's say roll like the
sands of the desert over

00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:54.567
ancient civilization.

00:15:54.567 --> 00:15:57.433
So God must be with you.

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:59.767
But the fact that God is with
you may indicate that you're

00:15:59.767 --> 00:16:03.300
an elite and that the people
that you conquered are simply

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.367
going to stay that way.

00:16:04.367 --> 00:16:07.333
Or that if they want to become
Muslim, that makes sense.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:10.067
Obviously Got favors Islam.

00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:13.567
If they don't want to become
Muslim, that's their lookout.

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:15.833
So it does not mean
that you have a

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.333
hostile conquest policy.

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:23.700
Jihad is, in this context, not
incompatible with tolerance.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.233
"Tolerance" is a word I use
with caution as well.

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:30.833
Because it's not as if they
have a modern ideal of

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:34.333
tolerance, of individuality, of
"You have your religion, I

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:42.800
have my religion." It is more
that they are not bothered by

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.200
the presence of people
of other religions.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.933
And we'll see some
of why that is.

00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:54.467
So, number five, a policy of
allowing conquered people to

00:16:54.467 --> 00:16:57.233
maintain their religion,
livelihood, and private lives.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.900
So there are other rapid
conquests in world history,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.967
and there are other rapid
conquests by people who are

00:17:07.967 --> 00:17:12.100
technologically or culturally
or certainly economically

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.500
behind the people that
they conquer.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:20.733
The Mongols conquer an
incredible territory.

00:17:20.733 --> 00:17:24.467
The Vikings, which we will end
the course with, are certainly

00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:29.467
less developed, economically,
less civilized, than the

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:32.500
Carolingian Empire that
they plunder.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:36.400
What is unusual about Islam, and
I reiterate something that

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.767
I've said already, perhaps more
than once is that it has

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:41.167
a permanent effect.

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:45.567
Rather than disappearing back
into their yurts, like the

00:17:45.567 --> 00:17:51.433
Mongols, or disappearing back
into the tundra- well that's

00:17:51.433 --> 00:17:53.833
an unfair description of
Scandinavia- but disappearing

00:17:53.833 --> 00:18:00.767
back into the north like the
Vikings, the Islamic powers

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:07.400
not only stay as occupiers
but become, themselves, a

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.433
cultivated, wealthy, highly
civilized empire.

00:18:13.433 --> 00:18:16.567
What is unusual about the Arabs,
then, is their ability

00:18:16.567 --> 00:18:22.000
to consolidate and to hold
onto their conquests.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.367
OK, I think I said before there
are three startling

00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:28.433
things about Islam: the career
of Mohammed, the rapidity and

00:18:28.433 --> 00:18:31.167
extent of the conquests, and
this business of the cultural

00:18:31.167 --> 00:18:33.833
adaptability, consolidation,
of the Arab conquerors.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:39.967
Questions so far?

00:18:39.967 --> 00:18:43.267
I think that the conquest part
of this is clearer than the

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:45.600
internal divisions.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.900
So let's proceed with the
conquests rapidly.

00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:57.000
There's no single regime,
there's no rule issued by the

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.433
Caliphate for conquest policy.

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:04.933
In general, if the population
surrendered on terms the way

00:19:04.933 --> 00:19:08.500
Alexandria had in 642,
that was fine.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:15.033
Then the people were allowed to
keep their local customs.

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:17.833
In other words, they were
allowed to keep their houses,

00:19:17.833 --> 00:19:21.567
their jobs, their religion,
their property.

00:19:24.533 --> 00:19:27.900
The Arabs were intent
on plunder, however.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.000
Why didn't they just pillage
these people?

00:19:32.533 --> 00:19:36.433
Some of it is just wisdom.

00:19:36.433 --> 00:19:37.933
They are thinking they're going
to have to govern these

00:19:37.933 --> 00:19:41.533
places and that they might as
well harness the industry and

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:44.733
enterprise of the population
rather than kill them or

00:19:44.733 --> 00:19:46.767
disperse them.

00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:50.700
Some of it was, I think, that
they had so much plunder

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.533
available to them from other
sources that they didn't have

00:19:53.533 --> 00:19:59.867
to bother with some middle-class
artisan's wealth.

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.567
They could plunder churches.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:03.433
They could seize Church lands.

00:20:03.433 --> 00:20:06.100
They could take the
state treasury.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:11.333
Between them, the state and the
Church held so much wealth

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:15.700
that the Arab conquerors didn't
really want to bother

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.067
with mere private property.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.533
The leading nobles
tended to flee.

00:20:24.533 --> 00:20:26.833
They allied their interests
with the state.

00:20:26.833 --> 00:20:29.733
They were very large property
owners; that land could be

00:20:29.733 --> 00:20:32.667
confiscated.

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:36.300
And the reward to the conquerors
was to be settled

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:39.333
on lands of their own, with
tenants of their own, and

00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:44.067
these lands tended to have
belonged to the state or to

00:20:44.067 --> 00:20:46.167
the Church.

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:51.033
They received long leases for
these lands from the Caliphate

00:20:51.033 --> 00:20:55.700
and they paid a religious tax, a
kind of tithe, as members of

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.433
the umma, the religious
community.

00:21:00.433 --> 00:21:04.033
Non-Muslims were allowed to
keep their property, their

00:21:04.033 --> 00:21:08.833
land and other property, but
they had to pay two taxes that

00:21:08.833 --> 00:21:10.133
Muslims did not.

00:21:10.133 --> 00:21:14.333
They had to pay what is called
in the English-speaking world

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:18.233
a poll tax, which is basically
just a head tax.

00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:23.033
Every person or every household
pays a certain

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:23.733
amount of money.

00:21:23.733 --> 00:21:27.300
It's actually kind of like a
flat tax, but it has nothing

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.233
to do with income.

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:33.833
It is simply that you as a
person living in this polity

00:21:33.833 --> 00:21:36.800
pay this as a tax.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.967
And then a land tax.

00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:42.467
Land tax obviously more variable
depending on how much

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:43.267
land you own.

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:46.333
If you own x amount of
land, you pay a tax.

00:21:46.333 --> 00:21:50.167
If you own 8x amount of land,
you pay eight times that tax,

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:51.433
at least that is the theory.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:58.100
And given that, as we said, as
far back as Diocletian, you

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:03.600
need to have very good records
to keep track of taxes, then

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.000
they kept on the old officials
who had those records.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.067
So the language of
administration in Syria

00:22:10.067 --> 00:22:13.400
remains Greek for quite a while;
in Egypt, it remains

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.567
Greek; in Persia, it remains
Persian, because the guys that

00:22:16.567 --> 00:22:19.333
are running it are basically the
same guys who are running

00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:21.367
it under the old empire.

00:22:21.367 --> 00:22:23.633
Why would the Arabs want
to get rid of them?

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:26.633
They would want to get rid of
the high officials, the

00:22:26.633 --> 00:22:33.700
nobles, but the functionaries,
the bureaucrats, stayed on.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:38.800
Most people who were Christians
or Jews paid no

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.000
more tax to the conquerors than
they had to the Byzantine

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.500
or Persian Empire.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.800
In other words, they were
conquered, their lives did not

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:53.000
radically change, their
taxes did not go up.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.333
They didn't really miss
the Persian or

00:22:55.333 --> 00:22:58.700
Byzantine imperial regimes.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.700
The question, however, is why
are the Arabs so tolerant?

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:05.533
And this surprises people who
assume that Islam has always

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:09.367
been spread with a kind of
totalizing militancy.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.100
In fact, for a time, the
conquerors didn't encourage

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.733
conversion because you can see
the consequences of conversion

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:22.233
for taxation.

00:23:22.233 --> 00:23:24.600
If eighty percent percent of the
population is Jewish and

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.167
Christian, then eighty percent
of the population is in a high

00:23:27.167 --> 00:23:28.867
tax bracket.

00:23:28.867 --> 00:23:32.167
If you are running things, it's
to your interests that

00:23:32.167 --> 00:23:35.733
they not convert to that very
low ten percent tax bracket or

00:23:35.733 --> 00:23:40.233
whatever the zakat, the
religious tax is.

00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:43.167
"Go ahead and have fun.

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:47.333
It's Sunday go to church, don't
bother me, pay your

00:23:47.333 --> 00:23:52.800
taxes," would be a fairly common
attitude on the part of

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.067
the conquerors.

00:23:56.567 --> 00:23:59.333
And of course there's a respect
for Christianity and

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:02.833
Judaism that I've already
mentioned.

00:24:02.833 --> 00:24:05.600
Some of it is confidence
eventually people are just

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.633
going to see that Islam
is more successful.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.967
Up until the Abbasid regime,
750, a vast majority of the

00:24:20.967 --> 00:24:24.767
conquered territory remained
in the religion that it had

00:24:24.767 --> 00:24:29.233
had before the conquest. In
other words, in Egypt in 750,

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:32.233
a majority of the population
were Christian.

00:24:32.233 --> 00:24:35.567
And indeed in Egypt, to this
day, ten percent of the

00:24:35.567 --> 00:24:36.933
population is Christian.

00:24:39.433 --> 00:24:41.733
Certainly, Islam would gain.

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:49.700
And certainly now, ironically,
much more than in 800 AD or

00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:56.533
1200 AD or 1500 AD or 1900
AD, it's tough to be a

00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:58.200
Christian in Egypt.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:04.133
This is a problem of modernity,
not of the period

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:07.533
we are dealing with.

00:25:07.533 --> 00:25:10.167
So the process of conquest
is very rapid.

00:25:10.167 --> 00:25:12.733
The process of Islamization
is not.

00:25:12.733 --> 00:25:14.000
They are not to be confused.

00:25:20.467 --> 00:25:23.600
Amidst all these triumphs, the
caliph experiences divisions

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:32.767
that culminated in a civil
war between 656 and 661.

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:37.633
And the origins of it seems
to be the murder of

00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:41.400
Caliph Umar in 644.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.667
He was murdered by a
Persian Christian.

00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:51.767
So it's not a Muslim
assassination.

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:55.367
But it ushered in another
disputed election.

00:25:55.367 --> 00:26:01.233
And Ali, poor guy, presented
himself yet again as the

00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:03.633
successor of Mohammed.

00:26:03.633 --> 00:26:09.700
And again he was defeated,
this time by Uthman.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:16.033
Uthman, along with Abu Bakr and
Umar, we mentioned him as

00:26:16.033 --> 00:26:22.533
one of the original followers
of Mohammed.

00:26:22.533 --> 00:26:36.167
Uthman was a member of a
prominent clan, the Umayyads,

00:26:36.167 --> 00:26:39.200
a high status Mecca family.

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:46.033
High status, but the Umayyads
had opposed Mohammed.

00:26:46.033 --> 00:26:50.967
Uthman was an exception but his
family were among those

00:26:50.967 --> 00:26:56.133
people of Mecca who had been the
most steadfast in opposing

00:26:56.133 --> 00:26:58.233
this upstart guy.

00:27:05.067 --> 00:27:11.000
So to some, especially the
followers of Ali, Uthman

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.467
appeared to be a representative
of a not really

00:27:18.467 --> 00:27:20.733
staunch Islamic family.

00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:25.833
They were not fervent
new followers.

00:27:28.967 --> 00:27:31.367
Why was Ali passed over
so many times?

00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:32.767
It's not clear.

00:27:32.767 --> 00:27:38.567
Here again, we are in a very
controversial area in which a

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:41.900
lot of later tradition
elaborates reasons for things

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.533
that may not have anything
to do with what the

00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:50.133
reality was in 644.

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:57.167
You start to have pro-Ali
parties or traditions.

00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:03.767
This is what would become the
Shiite party and pro-Umayyad

00:28:03.767 --> 00:28:08.300
or pro-Caliphate traditions,
that of the Sunnis.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.433
Neither of which is completely
to be relied on because

00:28:11.433 --> 00:28:13.100
obviously they are biased.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.233
Under Uthman, the pace of
conquest continues.

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:29.067
This naval battle in 655
took place,-- the

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:30.200
Battle of the Masts,--

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:34.833
in which the Byzantine navy was
defeated by the Arab navy.

00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:39.067
This meant that islands in
the Mediterranean start

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:41.300
to fall to the Arabs.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:47.467
Cyprus was conquered in
649, Rhodes in 654.

00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:51.033
Meanwhile, in the former Persian
Empire, the eastern

00:28:51.033 --> 00:28:57.567
part of Iraq, tending over
towards Persia, was conquered

00:28:57.567 --> 00:29:00.367
in 651 - 653.

00:29:00.367 --> 00:29:06.433
Armenia, north and west of
Persia, east of Anatolia, the

00:29:06.433 --> 00:29:09.933
area where the earthquake
was recently, was

00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:14.867
conquered in 653 - 655.

00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:19.633
But Uthman was particularly
disliked by much of the

00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:20.767
population.

00:29:20.767 --> 00:29:26.633
Unlike Umar, unlike the early
caliphs, he was regarded as

00:29:26.633 --> 00:29:32.567
lethargic and as a sensualist
let's say.

00:29:32.567 --> 00:29:38.333
Lethargic and profligate, a
lover of luxury, a monarch

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:42.500
rather than a leader,
a corrupt ruler.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:56.700
And he was murdered by
a Muslim in 656.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.400
Here we have the first
assassination of a caliph by

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.600
another member of
the faithful.

00:30:06.433 --> 00:30:08.667
And Ali was proclaimed
as caliph.

00:30:13.133 --> 00:30:17.433
The problem here is that Ali was
proclaimed caliph by the

00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:19.567
people who had assassinated
Uthman.

00:30:19.567 --> 00:30:24.967
Or at least he was perceived as
taking the title from the

00:30:24.967 --> 00:30:28.300
bloodied hands of assassins.

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:30.833
Whether he knew in advance
of the plot

00:30:30.833 --> 00:30:34.067
against Uthman is doubtful.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.500
But he starts off in a somewhat

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:42.000
false position as caliph.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:45.667
He is opposed bitterly by
the Umayyad family.

00:30:45.667 --> 00:30:48.800
But more than that, his claim to
the caliph is tarnished by

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:53.033
the circumstances under
which he came into it.

00:30:53.033 --> 00:31:00.633
And an Umayyad rose up against
him and starts the first civil

00:31:00.633 --> 00:31:02.733
war of Islam.

00:31:02.733 --> 00:31:12.533
This is Mu'awiya, the governor
of Syria who revolts in

00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:18.833
Damascus and leads a party
against Caliph Ali.

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:25.733
In fact, this gives rise to a
militant group of people who

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.967
hate both claimants.

00:31:28.967 --> 00:31:33.067
Ali is assassinated, and
Mu'awiya is wounded.

00:31:33.067 --> 00:31:38.433
Now Mu'awiya survives but the
tendency within Islam to

00:31:38.433 --> 00:31:44.467
dispose of enemies by violent
means has been sanctioned by

00:31:44.467 --> 00:31:45.767
the events of this period.

00:31:49.233 --> 00:31:52.067
So 661, the civil war is over.

00:31:52.067 --> 00:31:57.767
Mu'awiya moves the capital
from Medina to Damascus.

00:31:57.767 --> 00:32:02.267
He establishes the Umayyads as a
dynasty, and they would rule

00:32:02.267 --> 00:32:06.533
as caliphs until 750.

00:32:06.533 --> 00:32:09.500
What does this move from Medina
to Damascus mean?

00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:20.267
It certainly is a part of the
de-Arabization of the

00:32:20.267 --> 00:32:22.233
definition of the caliphate.

00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:26.367
Damascus is not an Arab city,
at least in its origin.

00:32:26.367 --> 00:32:30.633
It was part of the
Byzantine Empire.

00:32:30.633 --> 00:32:34.633
It is more centrally located
than Medina in terms of

00:32:34.633 --> 00:32:36.233
administering the Empire.

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:38.700
It's also more cosmopolitan.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.933
It has a lot of different
kinds of people.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:50.567
So the move is away from the
Arab heartland to a place

00:32:50.567 --> 00:32:58.133
where the population is
not necessarily Arab.

00:32:58.133 --> 00:33:02.967
It is part of the transformation
of the caliph

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:08.167
from what we would call
religious leadership to that

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:13.833
of a kind of monarch, king.

00:33:13.833 --> 00:33:15.167
The caliph lives in a city.

00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:17.000
He lives in a palace.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.233
He has an immense entourage.

00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:26.000
The days of the tents in Arabia
or of quasi-nomadic

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.767
followers of Mohammed are
definitively over with the

00:33:29.767 --> 00:33:32.100
defeat of Ali.

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:35.367
Defeat, but it's not
a complete defeat.

00:33:38.733 --> 00:33:44.233
Sh'ia means party or to
its opponents faction.

00:33:48.367 --> 00:33:53.567
And for a long time, the Shiites
are like the perpetual

00:33:53.567 --> 00:33:58.967
losers who cannot at the same
time be eliminated.

00:33:58.967 --> 00:34:03.133
They are a minority
within Islam.

00:34:03.133 --> 00:34:09.267
They are, at various times,
seemingly overwhelmed by the

00:34:09.267 --> 00:34:13.100
wealth, armies power
of the caliphs.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.133
But they never go away and
they never abandon their

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:21.900
claims. They form, thus, a
permanent dissenting group

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.167
within Islam.

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:29.800
What is the nature
of that dissent?

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:33.033
What don't they like
about Islam as it's

00:34:33.033 --> 00:34:37.133
practiced by the majority?

00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:45.533
Any sense of that from this
admittedly busy reading?

00:34:48.167 --> 00:34:53.100
It's key that you understand
what Shiism is and what its

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:54.133
grievances are.

00:34:54.133 --> 00:35:00.100
STUDENT: Do they reject the
caliph as a religious figure?

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.567
PROFESSOR: They
reject the caliph as a

00:35:01.567 --> 00:35:02.233
religious figure.

00:35:02.233 --> 00:35:04.433
Do they reject him because
he's not the

00:35:04.433 --> 00:35:05.667
descendant of Ali?

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.533
Partly.

00:35:09.533 --> 00:35:12.133
Part of this is a succession
question.

00:35:12.133 --> 00:35:15.033
They reject the caliph because
he's illegitimate.

00:35:15.033 --> 00:35:17.733
So it's kind of like a
dynastic question.

00:35:17.733 --> 00:35:20.267
The only real caliphs--

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:22.133
and they don't use
the term caliph.

00:35:22.133 --> 00:35:27.067
They start to use the term
"imam" as you've read.

00:35:27.067 --> 00:35:31.133
The only real religious leader
is not the guy sitting in

00:35:31.133 --> 00:35:36.033
Damascus in his palace with the
splish-splashing fountains

00:35:36.033 --> 00:35:38.400
and scented perfumes
everywhere.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.000
But to what extent do they
reject the caliphate as such

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
apart from the dynastic
question?

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.100
How would you describe Shiite
political theory?

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:04.067
If the Sunnis are monarchical,
if they are comfortable with a

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:08.767
caliph who rules over an Empire
of unbelievable extent,

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:11.200
what might the Shiites
prefer to see?

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.000
OK, Spencer?

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:12.333
STUDENT: The government of the
consensus of the umma, the

00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:13.600
community of the faithful.

00:36:18.333 --> 00:36:20.433
PROFESSOR: And
something more informal.

00:36:20.433 --> 00:36:24.433
Indeed, although I hesitate
to use this term, they are

00:36:24.433 --> 00:36:26.933
republican.

00:36:26.933 --> 00:36:31.700
Republican, not in the
twenty-first or twentieth

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:32.900
century American sense.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.867
What does republican mean
in this context?

00:36:37.767 --> 00:36:43.267
STUDENT: Choosing
representatives to then carry

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.700
out the will of the people.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:48.033
PROFESSOR: Yes,
anti-monarchical.

00:36:48.033 --> 00:36:52.200
They regard the caliph as a
sort of George III of the

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.200
Muslim world.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.733
They don't want to have a
single ruler who is a

00:36:58.733 --> 00:37:00.200
political ruler.

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:03.733
They're comfortable
with rulership in

00:37:03.733 --> 00:37:05.900
at least some sense.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.400
But the rulership should be
either elected or inspired.

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:20.933
They are radicals, in part
because they're dissenters.

00:37:20.933 --> 00:37:22.700
They're on the out.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:28.333
In part because they are
really angry and they

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:33.333
countenance violent tactics
of opposition.

00:37:33.333 --> 00:37:37.767
They are egalitarian and that's
sort of what I mean by

00:37:37.767 --> 00:37:38.967
republican.

00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:41.300
It's not so much that they
necessarily believe in a

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.167
representative system as that
they believe in a system in

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:53.533
which one class of believers is
not exalted over another.

00:37:53.533 --> 00:38:00.533
And one person is not ruling
merely because he comes from a

00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:02.133
certain background.

00:38:07.533 --> 00:38:10.767
Now what happens when religious
movements are

00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:12.233
frustrated?

00:38:12.233 --> 00:38:16.833
That is, when they are objects
of repression?

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:20.700
Because indeed the Shiites
were not particularly

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.867
tolerated by the caliph.

00:38:24.867 --> 00:38:30.333
Often, such religious groups
become fixated on a future in

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:31.867
which their claims will
be vindicated.

00:38:34.933 --> 00:38:36.200
This certainly makes sense.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.167
The Christians persecuted under
the Roman Empire wrote

00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:45.533
the granddaddy of all prophetic
texts, prophetic of

00:38:45.533 --> 00:38:47.467
the destruction of your
enemies, the Book of

00:38:47.467 --> 00:38:49.000
Revelations.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.567
I suggest that you take a look
at that anyway as it's always

00:38:52.567 --> 00:38:54.500
interesting reading.

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.067
And it is the book of the
Bible that has the most

00:38:58.067 --> 00:39:03.133
relevance, for better or worse,
to the current world we

00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:07.133
live in because it's the one
that talks constantly about

00:39:07.133 --> 00:39:10.133
the future and what's
going to happen.

00:39:10.133 --> 00:39:15.333
Is that future the Apple
computer future where

00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:19.133
everybody's wonderfully
connected and we all can just

00:39:19.133 --> 00:39:24.867
float in some kind of great
brain that we participate in?

00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:28.733
Or is the future some terrible
ecological disaster in which

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:32.733
we'll be cannibals and stuff?

00:39:32.733 --> 00:39:37.500
Or is the future the visitation
of those angels,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:42.300
those candlesticks, those
flowing rivers of molten metal

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.500
as in the book of Revelations?

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.233
Trumpets all over the place.

00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:49.900
Will one-third of the population
be wiped out one

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.967
day and then another
third the next day?

00:39:52.967 --> 00:39:56.400
The narrator of the Book of
Revelations cannot wait for

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.600
this to happen.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.533
It is in the nature of
apocalyptic thinking that it

00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:05.867
is violent because your enemies,
who are right now

00:40:05.867 --> 00:40:08.167
persecuting you, are going
to be confounded.

00:40:08.167 --> 00:40:10.500
And they're not going to be
confounded in the, "Oh gee,

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.367
I'm really sorry I persecuted
you," sense.

00:40:13.367 --> 00:40:18.067
They are going to be split
apart and pulverized.

00:40:18.067 --> 00:40:20.067
And you're going to be watching
and you're going to

00:40:20.067 --> 00:40:22.267
be applauding while they're
split apart and

00:40:22.267 --> 00:40:24.033
pulverized and tortured.

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:26.500
That's the nature of

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.467
messianic, apocalyptic thinking.

00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:32.200
Apocalyptic meaning the end of
the world in some kind of

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.833
conflagration, messianic
meaning the

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.100
presence of a savior.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.400
The two are not the same thing,
but they tend to go

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:43.633
together because there's going
to be somebody who's going to

00:40:43.633 --> 00:40:49.333
come and, amidst the bloodshed
and the fire, usher in a

00:40:49.333 --> 00:40:51.167
millennial world.

00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:53.367
That is to say, a world
in which bad

00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:55.467
things have been purged.

00:40:55.467 --> 00:41:01.233
And that messiah may be Jesus
Christ at the second coming.

00:41:01.233 --> 00:41:03.967
It may be the messiah
of Jewish tradition.

00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:10.133
Or in Shiite Islam, it
may be the imam, the

00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:12.900
rightly guided imam.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.267
The Shiites have a leader.

00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:17.700
I just said that they are
republican and egalitarian,

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:23.367
but they're not some kind of
Occupy Wall Street, we don't

00:41:23.367 --> 00:41:26.367
have any leaders,
anarchic group.

00:41:26.367 --> 00:41:32.267
They have leaders but they are
leaders who are inspired not

00:41:32.267 --> 00:41:35.600
merely administrators of
a huge bureaucracy.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.500
And these imams succeed each
other and are recognized by

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:48.000
the Shiite faction until the
death of the eleventh imam--

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.733
the death of the eleventh imam
without any obvious successor.

00:41:51.733 --> 00:41:53.367
Who is the twelfth imam?

00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:56.800
And we enter into this period
of what the book calls

00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:05.400
"occultation." Not a word
that you find used.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.467
Well, it's got some sort
of medical meaning too.

00:42:10.467 --> 00:42:11.733
Occultation, meaning what?

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.567
Come on, this is
in the reading.

00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:20.433
He's gone into hiding.

00:42:20.433 --> 00:42:23.733
Occult means hidden.

00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:24.767
There is a twelfth imam.

00:42:24.767 --> 00:42:25.967
We just don't know
where he is.

00:42:25.967 --> 00:42:29.033
He's in a cave somewhere.

00:42:29.033 --> 00:42:33.767
And there are imams and
imams after him.

00:42:33.767 --> 00:42:37.600
Either he is deathless or there
are other imams. But

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:41.467
they're all hidden because
they're not ready yet.

00:42:41.467 --> 00:42:45.867
But when they are ready,
centuries of grievance are

00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:48.067
going to be revenged.

00:42:51.667 --> 00:42:55.133
So there's a notion of a corrupt
and misguided Islamic

00:42:55.133 --> 00:43:08.400
establishment and of a true
subterranean occult, righteous

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:18.433
level of the practice
of the religion.

00:43:18.433 --> 00:43:25.033
So Shiism tends to apocalyptic
thinking, to prophecy.

00:43:25.033 --> 00:43:29.533
It exalts Ali and
his followers.

00:43:29.533 --> 00:43:32.433
And it feels that it is in
touch with the original

00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:36.233
desert, austere, egalitarian
roots of Islam that have been

00:43:36.233 --> 00:43:42.233
corrupted by the monarchical,
suspect purity

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:46.133
of the Sunni caliphate.

00:43:46.133 --> 00:43:47.367
Who becomes a Shiite?

00:43:50.133 --> 00:43:53.867
This is a hard question to
answer because it is more than

00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:55.100
just a party or faction.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.800
If it was just a party or
faction, it could not have

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:01.100
lasted into the contemporary
world with the

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:02.333
force that it has.

00:44:05.333 --> 00:44:10.300
Who is discontent under Islam?

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.733
It would seem logical that the
people who would be discontent

00:44:14.733 --> 00:44:21.967
would be non-Arabs because there
is increasingly, as the

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:28.433
Islamic world takes shape, a
population of people who do

00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:32.500
convert to Islam who
were not Arabs.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:36.300
We've said that the pace of
Islamization was slow but,

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.333
nevertheless, it was persistent
and logical.

00:44:41.333 --> 00:44:43.700
It's logical that people should
have converted to

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:47.333
Islam, not only because it is
a religion that to this day

00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:51.633
attracts lots of converts
because it has a religious

00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:59.267
appeal and, as I have argued,
it's a doable religion.

00:44:59.267 --> 00:45:01.467
It's a religion that does not
have a huge number of

00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:03.667
self-mortifying precepts.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:08.333
It is a way of living a
righteous life in the world

00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:12.567
and performing certain duties
that are not tremendously

00:45:12.567 --> 00:45:17.633
onerous or very subtle and
involve a lot of mental

00:45:17.633 --> 00:45:20.900
internal dialogue.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.233
So people are converting
to Islam.

00:45:23.233 --> 00:45:30.667
These people are known
collectively as mawali,

00:45:30.667 --> 00:45:31.933
singular, mawal.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.600
A mawal is a non-Arab Muslim.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:44.567
In the early years, by
definition, a convert.

00:45:44.567 --> 00:45:49.267
The day that Damascus fell,
there were no Muslims in

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:51.533
Damascus except maybe for
some Arab traders.

00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:59.767
As of the death of Mohammed,
all Muslims were Arabs.

00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:03.867
But within decades of this,
with the conquests and

00:46:03.867 --> 00:46:09.200
conversion, there are lots of
non-Arab Muslims. They may

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.067
need to learn Arabic to
understand the Koran.

00:46:13.067 --> 00:46:15.800
They're supposed to go to
Mecca and so forth.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:17.967
But they are not Arabs.

00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:23.267
Are they equal to Arabs?

00:46:23.267 --> 00:46:25.600
Well, Arabs are always, to
this day, going to feel

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.867
themselves to have a special
relationship, a special status

00:46:29.867 --> 00:46:33.100
should we say, because Mohammed
was an Arab and the

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.667
movement starts in Arabia.

00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:40.000
But as I'm sure you know, the
largest countries from the

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.267
point of view of population
that are Islamic are not

00:46:44.267 --> 00:46:46.733
Arabic, almost at all.

00:46:46.733 --> 00:46:50.667
Indonesia is the largest Muslim
country in the world.

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:54.800
India is the second largest
Muslim country in the world

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.933
even though its population is
so large that Islam is a

00:46:57.933 --> 00:46:58.700
minority there.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.033
Pakistan is the third
largest, I think.

00:47:02.033 --> 00:47:06.433
These all are countries
without Arabs.

00:47:06.433 --> 00:47:08.933
Iran is not Arabic.

00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:15.033
It is, as we all know,
an Islamic republic.

00:47:15.033 --> 00:47:18.200
The world of Arabs is very
numerous but the world of

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:20.667
non-Arab Muslims is more so.

00:47:20.667 --> 00:47:24.433
And it is starting to become
that way in the period that

00:47:24.433 --> 00:47:26.100
we're talking about.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.533
The Arabs are simply a small
number of conquerors.

00:47:29.533 --> 00:47:33.933
And particularly in Persia,
where the pace of conversion

00:47:33.933 --> 00:47:37.333
is faster than that of say Egypt
or Syria, there are a

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:38.567
lot of mawali.

00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:44.433
At some point, some of the
benefits of conversion, the

00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:50.533
fiscal benefits of conversion,
are eliminated because the

00:47:50.533 --> 00:47:54.567
state, the Caliphate can't
afford to have a population

00:47:54.567 --> 00:47:58.200
that is only paying the
low religious tax.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.933
So it would seem that the moment
at which you say, "OK,

00:48:02.933 --> 00:48:05.300
we're happy that you're
becoming a Muslim.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.433
You're still paying land and
poll taxes because we can't

00:48:09.433 --> 00:48:12.633
actually aspire to make all
Muslims equal from a fiscal

00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:15.533
point of view." At that point
you would have some angry

00:48:15.533 --> 00:48:17.900
malawi, at least so
one would think.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:22.567
And so, one would think, these
would be proto-Shiites or

00:48:22.567 --> 00:48:26.567
Shiite recruiting grounds.

00:48:26.567 --> 00:48:28.467
There's a lot of debate
about this.

00:48:28.467 --> 00:48:32.133
Berkey kind of skirts
over this issue.

00:48:32.133 --> 00:48:35.067
Other scholars doubt that
this is the case.

00:48:35.067 --> 00:48:37.667
They don't actually think
there's such a close

00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:43.833
connection between the Shiite
party and discontented people.

00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:46.167
Or at least there is a
connection between the Shiite

00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:48.567
party and discontented people,
but the discontented people

00:48:48.567 --> 00:48:51.067
are not discontent because
of their tax position.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:58.900
The presence of discontent
within Islam is a constant.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:03.700
The presence of prophecy within
Islam is a constant,

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:08.233
even though the teaching of
the religion has been that

00:49:08.233 --> 00:49:10.867
Mohammed is the last prophet.

00:49:10.867 --> 00:49:17.000
It's very hard to put a stop to
prophecy in the Christian

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.800
religion, in the Jewish
religion,

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.833
in the Muslim religion.

00:49:20.833 --> 00:49:23.733
Once you have started to talk
about inspired religious

00:49:23.733 --> 00:49:29.367
leaders, they're going to crop
up even after you've declared

00:49:29.367 --> 00:49:32.867
an end of religious charisma.

00:49:32.867 --> 00:49:35.767
And the consequences of
that and the splendor,

00:49:35.767 --> 00:49:39.833
nevertheless, of the Abbasid
Empire will form our subject

00:49:39.833 --> 00:49:41.800
for the next lecture.

Professor Ben Polak:
So last time we covered a

00:00:04.181 --> 00:00:06.987
whole bunch of new ideas,
and it was really quite a lot

00:00:06.987 --> 00:00:10.422
of ideas for one class.
Here's some of the ideas we

00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:12.836
covered.
We talked about information

00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:16.375
sets, and these were ways to
allow us to model imperfect

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:19.300
information.
So what's imperfect information?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.324
It's a way of being able to
capture both simultaneity in

00:00:23.324 --> 00:00:26.690
moves and sequential moves in
the same game.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.339
So it's a way that's going to
allow us to meld the lessons

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.540
from before the mid-term and
after the mid-term.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.616
Then we talked about what
strategies meant in this

00:00:36.616 --> 00:00:39.378
context, and the basic idea is
strategies are

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:42.705
instructions--strategies for
each player--give them an

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:45.970
instruction at each of their
information sets.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.145
Then we talked about what
sub-games were,

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:49.940
and, leaving aside
technicalities,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.280
sub-games were just games
within games.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.095
And finally we introduced the
idea of sub-game perfection

00:00:56.095 --> 00:00:59.979
which is our new solution
concept that refines the idea of

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:02.803
Nash equilibrium.
What sub-game perfection is

00:01:02.803 --> 00:01:05.798
going to do is it's going to
instruct the players to play a

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.760
Nash equilibrium in every
sub-game.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.571
Another way of saying it is,
a sub-game equilibrium is a

00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.590
Nash equilibrium in the whole
game, but in each sub-game it

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.781
induces Nash play as well.
Now, we're going to see today

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.236
examples.
If we have time I'll go through

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:25.354
three different examples,
and I'll tell you at the end of

00:01:25.354 --> 00:01:28.529
each example what it is I'm
hoping to be able to take away

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:31.590
from that example.
So, last time was a lot of

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.000
formal stuff.
Today is going to be a lot of

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.130
examples.
Okay, that's our agenda.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.080
Here's a game.
Here's our first example.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.445
And I call this example,
I call this game,

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:47.560
"don't screw up," for reasons
we'll see in a minute.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.319
So this is a game in which
Player 1 has to choose between

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.095
Up and Down.
If Player 1 chooses Up then

00:01:56.095 --> 00:02:01.650
Player 2 gets to move and
chooses between left and right.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.661
And if Player 2 chooses left
then Player 1 gets to move again

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.170
and Player 1 chooses between up
or down.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.000
Everyone looking at that game?
So why don't we play this game

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.009
since we haven't played a game
for a while.

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.780
We'll play a couple of games
today.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.960
So what I'm going to do is
let's divide the class in two.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.210
So if I just draw a line down
the middle of the class,

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.828
everybody to my left (to your
right), everybody on this side

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:32.650
of the class is a Player 1.
Okay you're all Player 1's.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.942
And everyone on this side of
class you're Player 2,

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:40.090
including you guys hiding from
the camera, you're Player 2's.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.479
Okay, so let's figure out what
we're going to do.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.509
Everyone had the time to look
at the game?

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:51.465
So Player 1's you get to move
first, those of you who are

00:02:51.465 --> 00:02:55.270
going to choose Down raise your
hand now.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.099
Raise your hand.
Wave it in the air.

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.080
Keep it up so the camera can
see you.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.160
And those of you who are going
to choose Up raise your hands.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.294
Lots more Ups.
Those of you who chose Up why

00:03:07.294 --> 00:03:09.639
don't you all stand up.
I don't want to do all the

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.332
exercise here,
so all those who chose Up,

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:11.840
stand up.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.445
So you can see that choosing
down ends the game,

00:03:17.445 --> 00:03:20.099
so this many people are still
playing the game.

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.463
Everyone who is still sitting
down, everyone who sat down here

00:03:23.463 --> 00:03:25.975
has exited.
All right, Player 2's you get

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:27.720
to move now.
So Player 2's,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.615
those of you who choose right,
including the people on this

00:03:31.615 --> 00:03:34.592
aisle,
those people who choose right

00:03:34.592 --> 00:03:38.110
raise your hand now--one right
over there.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.660
Those of you who choose left
raise your hands.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.747
Why don't you guys all stand
up, just to get you awake on a

00:03:45.747 --> 00:03:48.990
Monday morning,
everyone's sleepy otherwise.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:54.319
Let's go back to Player
2's--sorry Player 1--those of

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.090
you who are still in the game.
So those of you who chose Up

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.738
the first time,
how many of you now choose

00:04:03.738 --> 00:04:05.833
down?
Raise your hand if you choose

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:08.579
down;
and raise your hand if you

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.936
choose up.
Just to get a sample of this,

00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:13.660
let's get the 2's to sit down
again so people can see them.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.677
So 2's sit down.
Those of you Player 1's who are

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:22.220
still in the game who were
choosing up raise your hand now.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.720
I think that's everybody,
is that correct?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.847
Okay, you can all sit down.
So let's just talk about this

00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:28.740
game for a while and then we'll
analyze it.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.778
Now, this is not a difficult
game from the point of view of

00:04:31.778 --> 00:04:33.769
stuff we've done since the
mid-term.

00:04:33.769 --> 00:04:36.833
It's pretty clear what we
should do in this game by

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:39.810
backward induction.
So why don't we start there.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.491
Okay, so by backward induction,
we find that if Player 1 gets

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:48.861
to move a second time then
they're choosing between 4 and

00:04:48.861 --> 00:04:51.819
3,
and they're going to choose 4.

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.041
Player 2, if they get to move,
knowing that Player 1 is going

00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.320
to choose up tomorrow,
they're going to be choosing

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.779
between 3 if they choose left or
2 if they choose right.

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:07.234
So they're going to stay in the
game and choose left,

00:05:07.234 --> 00:05:08.130
which is what most of you did.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:14.271
Finally, Player 1 at the
beginning of the game,

00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:18.044
knows that Player 2 is going to
choose left whereupon she's

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:21.197
going to choose up,
so if she chooses Up she's

00:05:21.197 --> 00:05:24.702
going to end up getting 4,
and if she chooses Down she's

00:05:24.702 --> 00:05:27.490
going to get 2,
so she's going to choose Up.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.024
So it's clear what backward
induction does in this game and

00:05:30.024 --> 00:05:31.860
that's what most people did in
the game.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.050
Is that right?
However, not everybody did it.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.410
Some of the Player 1's
actually, why don't you raise

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.166
your hand, those people who
chose Down--the ones who chose

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.664
down.
There were more than that.

00:05:45.664 --> 00:05:47.899
You can all stand up.
Those of you who didn't stand

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:50.085
up just now raise your hands.
People are hiding now,

00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:52.182
but that's okay.
Those people who chose Down,

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:54.668
they may have had a reason for
choosing Down,

00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:58.002
and their reason for choosing
Down might have been that they

00:05:58.002 --> 00:06:01.336
thought--even though they can do
backward induction--so even

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:04.444
though they know that by
backward induction Up gets them

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:08.569
the better answer--they might be
worried that if they choose Up,

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.879
Player 2 will screw up and
choose right.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.554
Notice that if Player 2 chooses
right then Player 1 only gets 1,

00:06:16.554 --> 00:06:20.231
whereas Down yielded 2.
So in some sense Down was the

00:06:20.231 --> 00:06:24.189
"safe" thing to do for Player 1
given that they might be worried

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:27.467
that Player 2 might screw up.
Does that roughly--just nod if

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:29.495
this is the case:
for those people who chose down

00:06:29.495 --> 00:06:31.269
is that kind of what you were
thinking?

00:06:31.269 --> 00:06:33.833
Some people are shaking their
heads, but some people are

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.120
nodding.
That's a good sign.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.050
Now why might Player 2 in fact
screw up and choose right.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.251
Because Player 2 might,
themselves, think that Player 1

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:47.379
might screw up at this stage.
If Player 1 were to screw up at

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:51.883
the last stage and choose down,
then Player 2 by choosing left

00:06:51.883 --> 00:06:55.654
would only get 1,
and for him the safe option

00:06:55.654 --> 00:06:58.629
therefore is right which yields
2.

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.990
So, to get the backward
induction answer here--which

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.679
most of us did--to get the
backward induction answer here

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:09.105
relies on Player 1 trusting
Player 2 to play backward

00:07:09.105 --> 00:07:12.029
induction,
and that requires Player 1 to

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.027
have trust in Player 2 trusting
Player 1 not to screw up in the

00:07:16.027 --> 00:07:17.802
last stage.
So say it again,

00:07:17.802 --> 00:07:21.127
Player 1 needs Player 2 not to
screw up, and that means Player

00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:24.670
1 needs to trust that Player 2
will trust her not to screw up.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.999
Everyone see the game?
Okay, so let's try and analyze

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:33.649
this game using what we learned
last time and see what we find.

00:07:33.649 --> 00:07:37.207
So the first thing to do is
let's look at strategies in this

00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.271
game.
So Player 2 just has two

00:07:39.271 --> 00:07:43.101
strategies, left and right,
because Player 2 only has one

00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.068
information set--and notice this
game is actually a game of

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:50.829
perfect information so it's
going to be very easy.

00:07:50.829 --> 00:07:55.956
Player 1 has two information
sets, this information set and

00:07:55.956 --> 00:07:59.860
that information set.
At each of them Player 1 has

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.399
two choices so she must have
four strategies in all.

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:10.410
So this game when we put it in
its matrix form is going to be a

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.029
4 x 2 game.
Here it is.

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:16.727
And the strategies for Player 1
are (Up, up),

00:08:16.727 --> 00:08:19.499
(Up, down), (Down,
up), and (Down,

00:08:19.499 --> 00:08:23.860
down).
And the strategies for Player 2

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.217
are just left and right.
And now we can put the payoffs

00:08:28.217 --> 00:08:29.861
in.
So ((Up, up),

00:08:29.861 --> 00:08:37.750
left) gets us (4,3).
((Up, up), right) gets us (1,2).

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:44.460
((Up, down),
left) gets us (3,1).

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.735
((Up, up, right) gets us (1,2)
again: we end up exiting the

00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:52.031
game here.
(Down, up) is easy because it's

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:56.697
just exiting the game at the
first stage, so all of these are

00:08:56.697 --> 00:09:00.350
going to be just (2,1).
Everyone happy with that?

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.230
So what I've done is translated
the game into its matrix form.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:10.009
And let's look for Nash
equilibria in this game.

00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:12.870
Let me do it at the board since
it's quite easy at this stage.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.802
So to look for Nash equilibria,
let's just worry about pure

00:09:15.802 --> 00:09:20.093
strategy equilibria for now.
So if Player 2 was choosing

00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:24.716
left then Player 1's best
response is the (Up,

00:09:24.716 --> 00:09:28.130
up) strategy.
And if Player 2 is choosing

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.541
right, then Player 1's best
response is either (Down,

00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:33.049
up) or (Down,
down).

00:09:33.049 --> 00:09:34.330
That's exactly the conversation
we just had.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.975
If Player 2 was going to "screw
up" and choose right then Player

00:09:37.975 --> 00:09:40.580
1 wants to get out of the game
immediately.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.259
Conversely, if Player 1 is
choosing (Up,

00:09:44.259 --> 00:09:49.354
up) then Player 2 is happy and
is going to choose left,

00:09:49.354 --> 00:09:53.876
trusting Player 1.
If Player 1 was going to choose

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:57.821
(Up, down), however,
that's Player 1 screwing up at

00:09:57.821 --> 00:10:01.170
the second stage.
So in that case Player 2 wants

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.590
to get out of the game and
choose right.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:07.424
If Player 1 is choosing (Down,
up) then Player 2 is

00:10:07.424 --> 00:10:11.259
actually--it doesn't matter
they're indifferent.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:14.315
And if Player 2 is choosing
(Down, down) then once again

00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:17.759
Player 2 is indifferent since
they don't get to move at all.

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:23.503
So from this we see that there
are three Nash equilibria,

00:10:23.503 --> 00:10:26.580
let me call them 1,2,
and 3.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:33.139
So one Nash equilibrium is
((Up, up), left).

00:10:33.139 --> 00:10:40.730
Another Nash equilibrium is
((Down, up, right):

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:45.527
that's here.
And the third equilibrium is

00:10:45.527 --> 00:10:47.570
((Down, down),
right).

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.912
So there are three pure
strategy Nash equilibria in this

00:10:53.912 --> 00:10:56.149
game.
Let's just see what they do.

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.331
So the first one ((Up,
up), left) is Up,

00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:05.813
left, up so it gets us to here.
So this one is the same

00:11:05.813 --> 00:11:10.040
equilibrium as corresponds to
backward induction.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.221
Is that right?
This one's the backward

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:15.523
induction equilibrium,
and the other two are

00:11:15.523 --> 00:11:17.390
different.
((Down, up),

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.071
right) and ((Down,
down), right) both end up down

00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:25.679
here exiting the game
immediately,

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:29.661
so both of these other
equilibria fail backward

00:11:29.661 --> 00:11:33.118
induction.
So let's put backward induction

00:11:33.118 --> 00:11:36.785
with a line through it:
they're failing backward

00:11:36.785 --> 00:11:39.730
induction.
So you might ask why are they

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:41.946
equilibria?
We've seen examples like this

00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:43.899
before, for example,
in the entry game.

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:45.840
We looked at some examples last
time.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.180
So, in this game,
the reason these are equilibria

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.494
even though they fail backward
induction exactly coincides with

00:11:53.494 --> 00:11:57.600
that conversation we just had
about worrying about the other

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.083
person screwing up.
So, in particular,

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:06.991
if Player 1 thinks that Player
2 is choosing right--that is to

00:12:06.991 --> 00:12:09.201
say,
thinks that Player 2 is going

00:12:09.201 --> 00:12:12.107
to screw up--then Player 1
doesn't want to travel up the

00:12:12.107 --> 00:12:14.960
tree because she knows she'll be
carried down here,

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.580
and instead she just chooses
the safe option and gets 2.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.695
So from Player 1's point of
view, if Player 2 was going to

00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:24.935
choose right,
then getting out of the game

00:12:24.935 --> 00:12:28.159
doing the safe thing is the best
response for Player 1.

00:12:28.159 --> 00:12:31.192
And for Player 2's point of
view, if Player 1's exiting the

00:12:31.192 --> 00:12:34.277
game it really doesn't matter
what Player 2 says she's going

00:12:34.277 --> 00:12:37.115
to do,
because she doesn't get to move

00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:40.700
anyway so that's why these are
both equilibria.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.663
Okay, so what we're going to do
next, we've translated this into

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.291
a tree.
We've written down the

00:12:46.291 --> 00:12:48.751
strategies.
We want to actually see which

00:12:48.751 --> 00:12:51.800
of these Nash equilibria are
sub-game perfect?

00:12:55.429 --> 00:12:58.163
Let me give myself a bit more
room here because I want to keep

00:12:58.163 --> 00:13:02.494
this in sight.
So let's get rid of this and

00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:04.560
raise this one.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.763
So the next question is which
of these three Nash equilibria

00:13:13.763 --> 00:13:17.840
are sub-game perfect?
To do that we need to start by

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.302
identifying the sub-games.
And, of course,

00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:22.475
just having hoisted that board
up there, I have to hoist it

00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:24.801
down again.
Okay, so what are the sub-games

00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:28.450
here?
Well the simplest sub-game is

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:35.049
this simple sub-game at the end,
in which Player 1 moves.

00:13:35.049 --> 00:13:38.720
That's a very obvious sub-game,
is that right?

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.470
That's a little game within a
game, it's a rather trivial game

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.769
because it's a one player game,
but it is a game.

00:13:43.769 --> 00:13:48.889
So let's examine that one
first, that's the last sub-game.

00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:54.650
So the last sub-game here is a
somewhat trivial sub-game.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.162
It looks like this.
Player 1 is the only mover and

00:13:58.162 --> 00:14:02.160
they're choosing either up or
down and the payoffs are (4,3)

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.293
and (3,1): and frankly we don't
really care at this point what

00:14:06.293 --> 00:14:10.155
Player 2's payoffs are because
Player 1 is the only person

00:14:10.155 --> 00:14:13.806
who's playing in this sub-game.
But nevertheless,

00:14:13.806 --> 00:14:18.629
let's put them there.
And if we write this up as a

00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:24.440
matrix--here it is as a matrix.
Since Player 1 is the only

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.946
mover they're choosing between
up and down, and the payoffs are

00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:32.290
(4,3) and (3,1),
and of course Player 2 doesn't

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:35.779
get to move so Player 2 is
irrelevant here.

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:41.718
And clearly the only Nash
equilibria in this game is for

00:14:41.718 --> 00:14:45.487
Player 1 to choose up.
Player 2, it doesn't really

00:14:45.487 --> 00:14:47.711
matter what they choose,
there's nothing they can do

00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:50.570
about it anyway,
but for Player 1 to choose up

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.671
is the Nash equilibria.
So the Nash equilibria in this

00:14:54.671 --> 00:14:57.820
trivial sub-game is 1 just
chooses up.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.549
Is that right?
So let's look at the play

00:15:01.549 --> 00:15:06.148
induced by our three candidate
Nash equilibria in this

00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:09.765
sub-game.
So each of our candidate Nash

00:15:09.765 --> 00:15:13.940
equilibria--here they are,
this one, this one,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.585
and this one--have an
instruction of how Player 1

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:21.549
should play in this sub-game.
And let me just pause a second.

00:15:21.549 --> 00:15:25.431
The reason that these three
equilibria have an instruction

00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:29.585
for how Player 1 should play in
the sub-game is because of our

00:15:29.585 --> 00:15:34.070
definition of a strategy.
Each strategy tells the player

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.259
how they should move at every
information set of that player.

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:42.912
So even if the strategy is such
that that information set won't

00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:46.448
be reached, the strategy still
has to tell you what you would

00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:49.295
do when you got there.
And now for the first time

00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:52.179
perhaps we're going to see why
that redundancy helps us.

00:15:52.179 --> 00:15:53.830
So let's look at the
instructions.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.309
Each of them gives an
instruction.

00:15:55.309 --> 00:16:07.389
The first one tells us to play
up in this sub-game.

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:18.570
The second one says up again,
and notice this was redundant.

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:21.722
Once you've chosen Down you
know you're not going to get to

00:16:21.722 --> 00:16:24.606
make a choice at the third node,
or your second node,

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:27.560
but nevertheless there's the
instruction and it says up.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:38.290
The third one says down.
So this is the instructions of

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.019
these three equilibria in this
little sub-game.

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:47.242
This is the play prescribed by
these three equilibria in this

00:16:47.242 --> 00:16:50.398
sub-game.
Two of them say up and those

00:16:50.398 --> 00:16:54.480
ones are going to induce the
Nash equilibrium in this

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.620
sub-game, but the third one does
not.

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:00.549
The third one says down and
that's not allowed.

00:17:00.549 --> 00:17:04.516
That's not allowed in a
sub-game perfect equilibrium

00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:08.716
because a sub-game perfect
equilibrium has to prescribe

00:17:08.716 --> 00:17:11.750
play in every sub-game that's
Nash,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.533
and here the third equilibrium
is telling Player 1 to choose

00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:19.060
down which is not a Nash
equilibrium in the sub-game.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:24.359
So what are we doing here?
Let's make it clear.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.569
We're finding the sub-game
perfect equilibria.

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:43.725
And what we've done is:
number 3 is eliminated because

00:17:43.725 --> 00:18:00.819
it induces play in this sub-game
that is not Nash equilibrium,

00:18:00.819 --> 00:18:03.759
not a Nash equilibrium in the
sub-game.

00:18:03.759 --> 00:18:05.822
We're really putting stuff
together now:

00:18:05.822 --> 00:18:07.779
to be able to draw this
conclusion,

00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:12.277
we really used the fact that
strategy 3 contained a redundant

00:18:12.277 --> 00:18:16.700
instruction, an instruction down
at this node that was never

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.962
reached.
But that helped us get rid of

00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:22.970
it.
So that one's gone: 3 is gone.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:27.324
Let's proceed.
I'm going to run out of board

00:18:27.324 --> 00:18:29.960
space here.
Have people got this one down?

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:36.620
I'll bring it back in a second,
almost, let me give it a

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.047
second.
What I want to do now is look

00:18:40.047 --> 00:18:43.123
at the next sub-game.
Maybe what I can do if I just

00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:45.281
remove this comment,
I can work on the right hand

00:18:45.281 --> 00:18:47.170
board, that'll allow you to look
at it.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.369
So all that comment said was 3
is eliminated.

00:18:50.369 --> 00:18:52.896
Let me work now on the right
hand half of this board,

00:18:52.896 --> 00:18:55.180
that'll allow it to be up there
a bit longer.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.989
Okay, so let's now look at the
next sub-game,

00:18:57.989 --> 00:19:00.990
and again, we're going to work
from the back.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:05.995
So the next sub-game back is
the sub-game that starts from

00:19:05.995 --> 00:19:10.650
this node, the sub-game that
starts from that node.

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:16.670
So let's identify that in a
different color.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:18.720
I used blue so let me use pink.

00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:26.908
So now we're going to look at
this sub-game,

00:19:26.908 --> 00:19:33.036
this big pink sub-game,
and again in this pink sub-game

00:19:33.036 --> 00:19:39.176
this game looks like this.
It starts with Player 2

00:19:39.176 --> 00:19:46.670
choosing between left and right,
and then Player 1 has to choose

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:53.569
up or down, and the payoffs are
(1,2), (4,3) and (3,1).

00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:56.545
Once again let's look at the
matrix form of this sub-game,

00:19:56.545 --> 00:19:59.363
and this is a little bit less
trivial than the last one

00:19:59.363 --> 00:20:02.130
because now there are really two
players playing.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:07.960
So here's the matrix that goes
along with this.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:16.164
Player 1 is choosing between up
or down and Player 2 is choosing

00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:20.434
between left or right.
And this is slightly,

00:20:20.434 --> 00:20:23.595
slightly cheating because in
fact, Player 1 of course knows

00:20:23.595 --> 00:20:26.920
what Player 2 is going to have
done by the time she moves,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.539
but never mind it'll do for now.
Let's just put the payoffs in.

00:20:30.539 --> 00:20:38.610
So (up, left) is (4,3) and
(down, left) is (3,1) and (up,

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:45.240
right) is (1,2) and this must
also be (1,2).

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.720
Everyone happy with that?
Just putting the payoffs in.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.202
And let's just look again at
pure-strategy Nash equilibria

00:20:52.202 --> 00:20:53.999
here.
There are actually mixed ones,

00:20:53.999 --> 00:20:56.099
but let's just worry about pure
ones for now.

00:20:56.099 --> 00:21:02.393
So the pure Nash equilibria
here in this little sub-game are

00:21:02.393 --> 00:21:03.950
what?
Well, let's just see.

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:13.190
If 2 chose left then 1 wants to
choose up.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.962
If 2 chooses right it doesn't
really matter what 1 chooses

00:21:16.962 --> 00:21:20.140
because she isn't going to get
to move anyway.

00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:26.869
Conversely, if 1 chooses up
then 2 wants to choose left.

00:21:26.869 --> 00:21:30.221
That's the example of 1 not
screwing up, so 2 wants to stay

00:21:30.221 --> 00:21:32.930
in the game.
But if 1 was to choose down

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.239
then Player 2 would like to get
out of the game,

00:21:36.239 --> 00:21:40.182
so if Player 2 thinks 1 is
going to screw up she wants to

00:21:40.182 --> 00:21:43.152
exit the game.
Very quickly we can see there

00:21:43.152 --> 00:21:46.930
are two equilibria here.
One of them is (up,

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:52.170
left) and the other one is
(down, right).

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:57.167
They correspond to playing down
this way, that's (down,

00:21:57.167 --> 00:22:01.240
right) and (up,
left) playing up this way.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:05.656
Once again, let's look at our
three equilibria in the parent

00:22:05.656 --> 00:22:08.717
game.
Here's our three equilibria in

00:22:08.717 --> 00:22:12.439
the parent game,
and let's see what play they

00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:16.997
induced in this little sub-game.
So we'll do exactly what we did

00:22:16.997 --> 00:22:19.163
before.
So 1,2, and 3:

00:22:19.163 --> 00:22:24.549
these are our three equilibria
from above.

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:29.984
And equilibrium number 1,
((Up, up), left) in this game

00:22:29.984 --> 00:22:32.400
prescribes (up,
left).

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:38.839
Is that right?
Equilibrium number 2,

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:47.288
((Down, up),
right) here prescribes up,

00:22:47.288 --> 00:22:51.866
right.
And equilibrium number 3,

00:22:51.866 --> 00:22:56.299
((Down, down),
right) here prescribes (down,

00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:57.330
right).

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.896
So which of these are
prescribing Nash equilibria in

00:23:04.896 --> 00:23:07.048
the sub-game?
Well (up, left) is an

00:23:07.048 --> 00:23:08.380
equilibrium.
It's that one.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:11.019
(up, left) is an equilibrium so
this is okay.

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:14.835
And (down, right) was an
equilibrium, so 3 is okay in

00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:22.410
this sub-game.
But (up, right) is not a Nash

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.925
equilibrium.
So in this sub-game,

00:23:26.925 --> 00:23:30.381
Nash equilibrium number 2,
the ((Down, up),

00:23:30.381 --> 00:23:34.577
right) equilibrium is
prescribing play that is not a

00:23:34.577 --> 00:23:39.349
Nash equilibrium in the
sub-game: so it's eliminated.

00:23:39.349 --> 00:23:42.349
It can't be a sub-game perfect
equilibrium.

00:23:42.349 --> 00:23:56.314
So here 2 is eliminated since
it induces non-Nash equilibrium

00:23:56.314 --> 00:24:01.900
play in this sub-game.

00:24:05.589 --> 00:24:08.500
Now we're done,
we know about the whole thing.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.606
So what we did here we started
with the whole game,

00:24:11.606 --> 00:24:14.339
we found there were three Nash
equilibria,

00:24:14.339 --> 00:24:17.840
we found that only one of them
agreed with backward induction.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.020
We then looked at the sub-games.
We first of all looked at that

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.829
blue sub-game and we found that
one of the equilibria,

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:25.950
equilibrium number 3,
was eliminated.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.521
Equilibrium number 3 is not
prescribing Nash behavior in

00:24:29.521 --> 00:24:32.884
this sub-game.
Then we looked at the slightly

00:24:32.884 --> 00:24:36.450
more complicated sub-game,
the pink sub-game,

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.514
and we found that equilibrium
number 2 prescribes the behavior

00:24:40.514 --> 00:24:43.779
(up, right) which is not Nash in
this sub-game.

00:24:43.779 --> 00:24:47.218
At this stage we've eliminated
two of the three equilibria and

00:24:47.218 --> 00:24:51.116
we're just left with one.
And the one we're left with,

00:24:51.116 --> 00:24:55.021
the only sub-game perfect
equilibrium, the only

00:24:55.021 --> 00:24:59.520
equilibrium that wasn't
eliminated by the fact that it

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.509
would prescribe bad behavior in
sub-games,

00:25:03.509 --> 00:25:08.622
the only SPE is number 1:
which is (Up,

00:25:08.622 --> 00:25:12.670
up) and left.
What do we notice?

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.775
We notice that that's the
equilibrium, that's the play

00:25:15.775 --> 00:25:18.470
that backward induction would
have selected.

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:31.610
So notice this is the backward
induction prediction.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.697
So what are the lessons here?
The lessons here are that our

00:25:40.697 --> 00:25:44.985
new idea, the idea of sub-game
perfect equilibrium is pretty

00:25:44.985 --> 00:25:48.775
easy to go about finding.
You just look at sub-games and

00:25:48.775 --> 00:25:52.170
check that the play in each
sub-game has to be Nash play.

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.434
If you start at the back,
you construct it by rolling

00:25:55.434 --> 00:25:58.509
backwards, much like we did
backward induction.

00:25:58.509 --> 00:26:01.089
Start at the last sub-game and
work backwards.

00:26:01.089 --> 00:26:03.979
The second thing is--not
surprisingly given that

00:26:03.979 --> 00:26:06.992
remark--not surprisingly,
where backward induction

00:26:06.992 --> 00:26:09.456
applies,
for example in this game,

00:26:09.456 --> 00:26:12.564
the sub-game perfect
equilibrium will find the

00:26:12.564 --> 00:26:16.569
equilibrium that is consistent
with backward induction.

00:26:16.569 --> 00:26:18.480
Remember that was our aim last
week.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.895
We wanted a way of refining
Nash equilibrium to throw away

00:26:21.895 --> 00:26:25.311
those Nash equilibria that were
inconsistent with backward

00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:27.571
induction.
So sub-game perfect equilibrium

00:26:27.571 --> 00:26:29.912
has done that.
It tells us now if backward

00:26:29.912 --> 00:26:32.851
induction applies,
the Nash equilibria you should

00:26:32.851 --> 00:26:35.789
focus on are the sub-game
perfect equilibria.

00:26:35.789 --> 00:26:41.365
Indeed, most people in the
class played that equilibrium

00:26:41.365 --> 00:26:43.818
just now.
Okay so that was really what I

00:26:43.818 --> 00:26:46.272
wanted to say about this
example, but let me just make a

00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:48.162
remark in passing.
I made this remark in the

00:26:48.162 --> 00:26:49.609
middle, so let me just make it
again.

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:54.510
When we write down strategies,
those strategies tell us what

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.540
seem to redundant moves.
But being forced to write down

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.280
those redundant moves is useful
because it allows us to model

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.834
what other people think you
would have done at those later

00:27:05.834 --> 00:27:08.274
nodes.
And sometimes I have to think

00:27:08.274 --> 00:27:11.844
what you think I would have done
at this later node before I

00:27:11.844 --> 00:27:14.809
decide not to go down that
branch of the tree.

00:27:14.809 --> 00:27:17.587
So being able to write down
everything in a strategy allows

00:27:17.587 --> 00:27:20.413
us to have everything in front
of us and makes that analysis

00:27:20.413 --> 00:27:22.306
simple;
and that's exactly what we did

00:27:22.306 --> 00:27:24.303
here.
So this was a fairly mundane

00:27:24.303 --> 00:27:27.690
example, because in particular
we didn't use any kind of

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:30.334
information set.
So next let's look at an

00:27:30.334 --> 00:27:33.100
example that does use some
information sets.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:37.030
So: new example.
Let me clean this off.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.750
Once again, I want to play this
example.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:58.416
But what I'd really like to
do--we're going to call this

00:27:58.416 --> 00:28:05.568
game the matchmaker game--and
what I'd actually like to find

00:28:05.568 --> 00:28:12.356
out is: do we still have our
couple we tried to send on a

00:28:12.356 --> 00:28:15.508
date?
Our hapless couple we tried to

00:28:15.508 --> 00:28:17.690
send on a date at about week
three.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.253
Are you guys still here?
There's the guy,

00:28:19.253 --> 00:28:20.720
what's your name again?
Student: David.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.129
Professor Ben Polak:
David, and what was the--is

00:28:24.129 --> 00:28:26.660
she hiding?
There she is thank you.

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.970
Your name was?
Student: Nina.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.119
Professor Ben Polak:
Nina and David.

00:28:30.119 --> 00:28:33.980
Good, can we get some mikes to
Nina and David actually?

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:39.767
Let me do it.
I'll go on talking while I'm

00:28:39.767 --> 00:28:43.322
doing this–.
Where's David,

00:28:43.322 --> 00:28:48.370
and Ale can you get a mike to
Nina?

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:50.944
That would be great thank you.
All right, so for weeks we've

00:28:50.944 --> 00:28:53.119
been trying to get this couple
to go on a date.

00:28:53.119 --> 00:28:57.611
It's our attempt to get
economics majors to become real

00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:59.998
people.
It's a hard thing to do and

00:28:59.998 --> 00:29:03.336
they're kind of the hapless
couple because first we sent

00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:07.220
them to the movies and they end
up going to different movies;

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.501
and then we sent them off for a
romantic weekend in New England

00:29:09.501 --> 00:29:11.009
and they end up doing different
things,

00:29:11.009 --> 00:29:12.961
one went to the theatre and
another one apple picking,

00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:14.250
I forget which way around it
was.

00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:17.156
And at this point,
I figure I'm a pretty bad

00:29:17.156 --> 00:29:19.859
matchmaker so what I'm going to
do is.

00:29:19.859 --> 00:29:23.271
I'm going to introduce a third
player into the game as the

00:29:23.271 --> 00:29:25.321
matchmaker.
So first of all I'll write down

00:29:25.321 --> 00:29:27.826
what the game is.
So the game at this point--the

00:29:27.826 --> 00:29:31.768
game is going to look like this.
Player 1 is the matchmaker,

00:29:31.768 --> 00:29:35.986
we can call him Player M if you
like, and he has a choice,

00:29:35.986 --> 00:29:42.246
he or she has a choice.
She could not send the couple

00:29:42.246 --> 00:29:50.920
out on a date or she could send
the couple out on a date.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:55.132
But being a better matchmaker
than me, if she sends them out

00:29:55.132 --> 00:29:59.487
on a date, she's going to stake
some money, she'll pay for the

00:29:59.487 --> 00:30:02.164
date.
And in the date once again

00:30:02.164 --> 00:30:05.138
they're trying to meet,
and once again,

00:30:05.138 --> 00:30:08.582
unfortunately,
they haven't figured out where

00:30:08.582 --> 00:30:10.606
to meet.
We'll put the payoffs in,

00:30:10.606 --> 00:30:12.859
in a second and we'll tell you
what the strategies are.

00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:18.433
So what I'm going to assume
here is I'm going to let Jake

00:30:18.433 --> 00:30:21.319
our T.A.
be our matchmaker.

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:24.299
And the reason I'm choosing
Jake is I think he's the nearest

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:27.430
thing I have in mind in this
class to being a Jewish mother.

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:30.343
I mean: he's neither Jewish--I
think he's not Jewish and he's

00:30:30.343 --> 00:30:32.375
not my mother,
but he is the T.A.,

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:36.275
who's responsible for bringing
some drink everyday in case I

00:30:36.275 --> 00:30:38.795
pass out in the lecture.
So that's the nearest thing I

00:30:38.795 --> 00:30:40.528
can think of.
So Jake's going to be our

00:30:40.528 --> 00:30:43.010
Jewish mother,
and Jake's going to either send

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.904
these guys on a date or not.
And Jake's smarter than me at

00:30:45.904 --> 00:30:47.579
this: he's actually good at
matchmaking.

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.340
And what he's going to do is,
he's going to send them

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.439
somewhere where they really--he
knows Yale students better than

00:30:51.439 --> 00:30:53.301
I do--and he's going to send
them really somewhere where

00:30:53.301 --> 00:30:55.589
they're going to meet.
So he's going to send them to

00:30:55.589 --> 00:30:58.267
go to the same lecture class
next year, and then they'll be

00:30:58.267 --> 00:31:00.992
sitting in the aisles in this
huge lecture class and they're

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:02.920
bound to meet.
All of you have sat next to

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.730
other people at some point.
So that seems like a good idea.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:08.709
So the classes he thinks of
sending them to--he says go to a

00:31:08.709 --> 00:31:11.706
large lecture class.
So they're either going to go

00:31:11.706 --> 00:31:14.829
to the Gaddis class which is
called "Cold War";

00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:17.549
or to the Spence class which is
called "China."

00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:19.730
Everyone know a little bit
about these classes?

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.955
These seem like reasonable
classes to go to meet your--to

00:31:23.955 --> 00:31:27.653
have a date--to meet somebody.
I mean the Cold War can be a

00:31:27.653 --> 00:31:29.852
fun class, I mean,
you hope it isn't a prediction

00:31:29.852 --> 00:31:32.740
of the future relationship but
the Cold War seems all right.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.799
And China is,
by all accounts,

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:36.894
a fantastic class.
It involves,

00:31:36.894 --> 00:31:40.376
something involving 20 million
people, most of them were in the

00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:42.960
class together,
so it's a pretty big class.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.432
So let's do that.
Unfortunately Jake makes the

00:31:46.432 --> 00:31:48.413
same mistake I do,
he's not going to tell them

00:31:48.413 --> 00:31:51.599
which class to go to.
So they have to decide whether

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:54.934
to take Gaddis or Spence,
and once again they're

00:31:54.934 --> 00:31:59.589
coordinating.
We'll call them Players 2 and 3.

00:31:59.589 --> 00:32:02.855
So here they are trying to
coordinate, and the payoffs are

00:32:02.855 --> 00:32:05.549
as follows.
So let's put in Jake's payoffs

00:32:05.549 --> 00:32:07.536
first of all.
So if they manage to

00:32:07.536 --> 00:32:10.280
coordinate, first of all,
if Jake doesn't send them,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.613
everybody gets nothing.
And if Jake does send them and

00:32:13.613 --> 00:32:17.287
they coordinate Jake makes 1
because he feels really happy

00:32:17.287 --> 00:32:19.687
about this.
After all there must be some

00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:21.559
motivation for people
matchmaking.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:24.741
So if they coordinate down here
Jake gets 1 as well,

00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:28.293
but if they fail to coordinate,
Jake feels rotten about it,

00:32:28.293 --> 00:32:30.892
particularly because he paid
for them to go this

00:32:30.892 --> 00:32:33.934
class--whatever the cost of a
class at Yale is--which is

00:32:33.934 --> 00:32:37.740
probably quite a lot actually.
So okay we'll call it 1 though

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.480
and otherwise the payoffs are
exactly the same as the payoffs

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.470
we used when we looked at this
game earlier on in the course.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:50.278
So the payoffs are going to be
(2,1) here and (0,0) if they

00:32:50.278 --> 00:32:53.855
fail to coordinate;
and (0,0) here if they fail to

00:32:53.855 --> 00:32:58.000
coordinate;
and (1,2), (1,2) here.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.892
So the implication of this is
that Player 2 who we'll assume

00:33:02.892 --> 00:33:08.033
is David, so David would like to
meet Nina but all other things

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:10.796
being equal,
he'd like to meet her at the

00:33:10.796 --> 00:33:13.069
Cold War.
And Nina would like to meet

00:33:13.069 --> 00:33:16.913
David, but all things being
equal, she would like to meet in

00:33:16.913 --> 00:33:18.773
China.
Not literally in China,

00:33:18.773 --> 00:33:21.670
but in the class.
So this is our game and we're

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:25.405
going to analyze this game,
but before we analyze it let's

00:33:25.405 --> 00:33:29.056
try and play it.
So what we need to do is first

00:33:29.056 --> 00:33:32.505
of all let's make sure things
work smoothly,

00:33:32.505 --> 00:33:36.677
let's have David write down
which class he's going to

00:33:36.677 --> 00:33:39.121
choose,
and Nina write down which class

00:33:39.121 --> 00:33:42.170
she's going to choose.
I've lost sight of Nina.

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:43.390
Somebody has to point
out--there she is.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.260
Write down which class you are
going to choose.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:49.461
Something been written down?
Jake you got your mikethere,

00:33:49.461 --> 00:33:54.269
so Jake are you going to send
this hapless couple or not?

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:57.405
Student: So I have Dave
in my section actually and I

00:33:57.405 --> 00:34:00.810
hear how much he's been talking
about Nina, so I'm going to roll

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.111
the dice and send them.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.232
He's going to send them
good, so we have them going off

00:34:05.232 --> 00:34:07.280
to this class and now let's see
what they wrote down.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:11.049
So Dave what did you write down?
Student: I'm going to

00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.833
give in and go to China.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:34:12.833 --> 00:34:13.990
You're going to go to China
and Nina?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:15.603
Student: I chose S.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:17.860
Great, so they managed to
meet, so it's a successful date.

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:18.510
So let's give them a round of
applause.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.588
I hear it's a great class too.
And in fact,

00:34:25.588 --> 00:34:27.293
I don't think it's going to
happen forever because I think

00:34:27.293 --> 00:34:28.400
he must be approaching
retirement.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.600
So that seems a pretty good
choice.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.079
So good: that worked very well.
Let's have a look now at this.

00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:36.130
Let's analyze this game and see
what we can do with this game.

00:34:36.130 --> 00:34:37.820
So how are we going to analyze
this game?

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.902
So no surprise we're going to
use the idea of a sub-game

00:34:40.902 --> 00:34:43.593
perfect equilibrium,
I'll collect the mikes later

00:34:43.593 --> 00:34:46.363
don't worry.
So we're going to use the idea

00:34:46.363 --> 00:34:48.550
of a sub-game perfect
equilibrium.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:52.050
So how do we figure out how to
work out what a sub-game perfect

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:54.614
equilibrium is?
We're going to use the same

00:34:54.614 --> 00:34:58.062
basic idea that we used--what
we've been using all along in

00:34:58.062 --> 00:35:00.911
backward induction.
It's the same idea in the game

00:35:00.911 --> 00:35:03.877
we just looked at just now.
What we're going to do is,

00:35:03.877 --> 00:35:07.519
rather than start from the last
decision node (we can't do that

00:35:07.519 --> 00:35:10.780
anymore) and work backwards,
instead of doing that,

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.118
we're going to start from the
last sub-game and work

00:35:14.118 --> 00:35:16.881
backwards.
In this example it's pretty

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:19.360
obvious what the last sub-game
is.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.050
The last sub-game,
the game within a game--there

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:27.605
is only really one--the game
within the game is this object

00:35:27.605 --> 00:35:30.193
here, is that right?
This is the game within the

00:35:30.193 --> 00:35:31.894
game.
Now, I could at this stage,

00:35:31.894 --> 00:35:35.313
I could do something else.
I could write down the whole

00:35:35.313 --> 00:35:39.260
matrix for the whole game and
have Jake choose the matrix,

00:35:39.260 --> 00:35:42.187
and Dave and Nina choose the
row and the column,

00:35:42.187 --> 00:35:44.429
but that's going to get us
astray.

00:35:44.429 --> 00:35:46.559
So I mean we could do that but
let's not worry about that.

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:48.639
Let's just start doing things
backwards.

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:52.444
So when we do things backwards
we'll start at the last sub-game

00:35:52.444 --> 00:35:55.327
and that last sub-game is an old
friend of ours,

00:35:55.327 --> 00:35:58.310
it looks exactly like this.
Let's just write it in.

00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:06.138
So it involves Players 2 and 3.
And 2 was choosing between

00:36:06.138 --> 00:36:09.498
Gaddis and Spence.
And 3 was choosing between

00:36:09.498 --> 00:36:14.032
Gaddis and Spence.
And their payoffs were--let me

00:36:14.032 --> 00:36:18.795
leave a space here--so it was
(2,1), (1,2),

00:36:18.795 --> 00:36:21.814
(0,0), (0,0).
So here are the payoffs of the

00:36:21.814 --> 00:36:24.264
relevant players in the game but
while we're here why don't we

00:36:24.264 --> 00:36:28.988
put in Jake's payoffs as well.
So Jake's payoffs were 1 here,

00:36:28.988 --> 00:36:32.500
1 here, -1 here,
and -1 there.

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.393
So the only relevant players
here are Players 2 and 3,

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:38.122
but I've put Player 1's payoffs
in as well because:

00:36:38.122 --> 00:36:40.469
why not, why not just keep
track of it.

00:36:40.469 --> 00:36:44.692
Everyone happy that that
exactly describes this little

00:36:44.692 --> 00:36:46.857
game?
For all intents and purposes we

00:36:46.857 --> 00:36:49.190
can forget the first payoff but
there it is.

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:52.030
This is a game we've seen many
times so far.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:55.635
It's the battle of the sexes,
or the battle of Dave and Nina,

00:36:55.635 --> 00:36:59.179
and in this game we already
know what the equilibria are.

00:36:59.179 --> 00:37:03.477
So the equilibria here,
let me just underline the best

00:37:03.477 --> 00:37:07.407
responses.
So if Nina is choosing Gaddis

00:37:07.407 --> 00:37:12.803
then Dave chooses Gaddis.
If Nina is choosing Spence then

00:37:12.803 --> 00:37:17.139
Dave would like to choose Spence
and conversely.

00:37:17.139 --> 00:37:19.136
So I've just underlined the
best responses for the players

00:37:19.136 --> 00:37:21.133
who are actually involved in the
game and haven't bothered

00:37:21.133 --> 00:37:23.129
underlining anything for Jake
because he isn't a player in

00:37:23.129 --> 00:37:24.699
this game.
Does that make sense?

00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:33.394
So the pure Nash equilibria in
this game are essentially

00:37:33.394 --> 00:37:39.560
(Gaddis, Gaddis) or (Spence,
Spence).

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:44.431
That's pretty easy.
From Jake's point of view,

00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:50.070
each of these pure strategy
Nash equilibria yield a payoff

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:53.219
for him of what?
What does he get?

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:55.717
If they go to (Gaddis,
Gaddis), he's happy that they

00:37:55.717 --> 00:37:57.873
met and he gets 1 and if they
choose (Spence,

00:37:57.873 --> 00:38:00.420
Spence), he's happy that they
met and he gets 1.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.181
Jake himself doesn't really
mind whether Dave and Nina learn

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:06.860
about China or learn about the
Cold War.

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:12.280
He just wants them to meet.
So, both of these yield 1 for

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:18.709
Jake.
They both yield a value of 1

00:38:18.709 --> 00:38:24.059
for Player 1,
who is Jake.

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:29.239
So from Jake's point of view,
going back a stage--what we're

00:38:29.239 --> 00:38:32.030
going to do now,
just as we did with backward

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.019
induction, we're going to roll
the game back.

00:38:34.019 --> 00:38:37.328
So we started by analyzing this
sub-game and now we're going to

00:38:37.328 --> 00:38:39.942
roll it back a stage,
just as we did with backward

00:38:39.942 --> 00:38:43.286
induction.
So when we roll back Jake is

00:38:43.286 --> 00:38:49.034
moving here, if Jake chooses not
to send them then we get (0,0,

00:38:49.034 --> 00:38:54.227
0) but the key part of this is
the first 0, that's Jake's

00:38:54.227 --> 00:38:58.711
payoff.
And if Jake sends them,

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:07.068
then what Jake gets is the
value to Jake--I'll put in Jake

00:39:07.068 --> 00:39:14.692
but value to Player 1--okay
value to Jake of the Nash

00:39:14.692 --> 00:39:20.698
equilibria in this sub-game.
Not a big thing to write,

00:39:20.698 --> 00:39:23.336
but that's what Jake gets.
And the others do too:

00:39:23.336 --> 00:39:26.032
the others get that as well.
In this case,

00:39:26.032 --> 00:39:30.240
rather than writing that long
piece, this is just equal to 1.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.209
Is that right?
So if Jake sends them he knows

00:39:34.209 --> 00:39:37.606
that they're going to play a
Nash equilibrium in this

00:39:37.606 --> 00:39:39.404
sub-game,
or he believes they're going to

00:39:39.404 --> 00:39:40.780
play a Nash equilibrium in this
sub-game.

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:46.437
And either of those two Nash
equilibria in the sub-game yield

00:39:46.437 --> 00:39:49.870
a payoff to Jake of 1.
So actually,

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.357
one of them is 1,
one of them yields payoffs of

00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:57.243
(1,1,2);
and the other yields payoffs of

00:39:57.243 --> 00:39:59.220
(1,2,1).
But since Jake is the only

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.340
mover here, let's just focus on
Jake.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:05.206
So from Jake's point of view
he's really choosing between 0

00:40:05.206 --> 00:40:07.739
and 1, so he's going to choose
send.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:14.093
So the sub-game perfect
equilibrium therefore--there are

00:40:14.093 --> 00:40:19.522
actually two of them here--one
is (send, Spence,

00:40:19.522 --> 00:40:24.489
Spence), that's what actually
happened.

00:40:24.489 --> 00:40:29.510
But there's another one which
is (send, Gaddis,

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:35.730
Gaddis) that would also have
been a pure strategy sub-game

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.434
perfect equilibrium.
So in either case,

00:40:39.434 --> 00:40:41.664
what we did,
just to remind ourselves,

00:40:41.664 --> 00:40:45.280
we first of all solved the
equilibrium down the sub-game,

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.670
the equilibrium in this blue
sub-game.

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.720
We figured how much that
equilibrium was worth for

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:53.210
everybody--but in particular for
Jake,

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.760
but for everybody--and then we
rolled that payoff back and

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.094
looked at Jake's choice.
In this particular case that

00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:02.422
game has two equilibria,
(send, Spence,

00:41:02.422 --> 00:41:04.750
Spence) and (send,
Gaddis, Gaddis).

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.256
However, some of you must be
suspecting at this point that

00:41:08.256 --> 00:41:11.456
there's actually another
sub-game perfect equilibrium

00:41:11.456 --> 00:41:12.940
here.
How do we know that?

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.260
Well let's just think about
this game.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.760
We've been trying to send this
couple on a date all semester.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.679
They haven't gone on a date all
semester.

00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:21.199
I'm embarrassing them,
but they haven't gone on a date

00:41:21.199 --> 00:41:22.536
all semester.
So there must be some

00:41:22.536 --> 00:41:24.610
possibility that they would fail
to coordinate.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:27.082
It would be a pretty weird
notion of equilibrium that

00:41:27.082 --> 00:41:29.745
concluded that they always
manage to coordinate and hence

00:41:29.745 --> 00:41:32.530
Jake always wants to send them.
Is that right?

00:41:32.530 --> 00:41:35.210
So let's also look at the other
equilibria here.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.344
Now the reason there's another
equilibrium in this

00:41:52.344 --> 00:41:54.618
sub-game--sorry,
the reason there's another

00:41:54.618 --> 00:41:57.652
equilibrium in the whole
game--the reason there's another

00:41:57.652 --> 00:42:00.955
sub-game perfect equilibrium in
the whole game is that there's

00:42:00.955 --> 00:42:03.610
another Nash equilibrium in the
sub-game.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:06.340
What's the other Nash
equilibrium in the sub-game?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:14.618
They could mix.
So it turns out that in the

00:42:14.618 --> 00:42:27.360
sub-game (here it is) there's
also a third mixed equilibrium.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:37.829
There is a mixed Nash
equilibrium.

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:40.090
Now we know how to work that
out.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.912
We could write down a P and a
Q, and we could look for those

00:42:42.912 --> 00:42:44.969
indifference conditions and
solve it out.

00:42:44.969 --> 00:42:46.842
But this is a sub-game,
sorry this is a game,

00:42:46.842 --> 00:42:49.353
this sub-game corresponds to a
game we've seen many times in

00:42:49.353 --> 00:42:51.051
this class so far,
and I think we probably

00:42:51.051 --> 00:42:52.210
remember what that equilibrium
is.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.003
Is that right?
I do anyway,

00:42:54.003 --> 00:42:55.690
so let's see if you remember it
as well.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:57.739
I'll write it down and we'll
see if you all looked alarmed.

00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:04.767
So I claim the equilibrium,
the other equilibrium has Dave

00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:11.548
playing with probability
(2/3,1/3), and has Nina playing

00:43:11.548 --> 00:43:16.952
with probability (1/3,2/3).
So this is another equilibrium

00:43:16.952 --> 00:43:18.971
in the sub-game.
People remember that this was

00:43:18.971 --> 00:43:20.480
an equilibrium in battle of the
sexes?

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.710
Yeah, people are nodding at me,
yeah okay.

00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:25.882
So it isn't too unintuitive.
We all know how we'd work it

00:43:25.882 --> 00:43:27.630
out.
We could go back and put in the

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:30.466
P and the Q, but it isn't too
unintuitive, it has Dave going

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:33.446
more often to the lecture course
that he would prefer all other

00:43:33.446 --> 00:43:35.691
things being equal;
and it has Nina going more

00:43:35.691 --> 00:43:38.126
often to the lecture course that
she would prefer all other

00:43:38.126 --> 00:43:40.388
things being equal.
And they do so in just such a

00:43:40.388 --> 00:43:42.280
way as to make each of them
indifferent.

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:48.489
Now, this sub-game induces a
different value for Jake.

00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:51.991
So suppose Jake thinks:
"I trust Dave and Nina to play

00:43:51.991 --> 00:43:55.822
a Nash equilibrium in their
sub-game but I don't know which

00:43:55.822 --> 00:44:00.050
one it is and I think maybe
they're going to play this one."

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.825
So suppose Jake thinks that
this is the equilibrium that

00:44:03.825 --> 00:44:09.061
Dave and Nina are going to play.
So now should Jake send them or

00:44:09.061 --> 00:44:11.289
not?
Well let's work it out.

00:44:11.289 --> 00:44:19.971
So now if he sends them,
if Jake sends Dave and Nina,

00:44:19.971 --> 00:44:29.320
or more anonymously if Player 1
sends Players 2 and 3,

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:34.190
then with what probability will
they meet?

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:43.199
Well this is just a little math
exercise, let's have a look at

00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:49.237
the game again.
So Dave is playing 2/3,1/3,

00:44:49.237 --> 00:44:59.579
is that right?
Nina is playing 2/3,1/3,

00:44:59.579 --> 00:45:06.545
is that right?
So the probability of their

00:45:06.545 --> 00:45:11.475
meeting is the probability of
this box, they could meet at

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:14.083
Gaddis,
plus the probability of this

00:45:14.083 --> 00:45:17.010
box, they could meet at Spence,
is that right?

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:22.821
So the probability of this box
is 1/3 x 2/3 so this box has

00:45:22.821 --> 00:45:28.332
probability 2/9 and the
probability of this box is 2/3 x

00:45:28.332 --> 00:45:32.340
1/3 so this box has probability
2/9.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:37.768
So the probability of their
meeting is 2/9 + 2/9 that makes

00:45:37.768 --> 00:45:39.949
4/9.
Everyone okay with that?

00:45:39.949 --> 00:45:44.971
So if Jake sends Dave and Nina
and they play this mixed

00:45:44.971 --> 00:45:51.660
strategy equilibrium,
then they meet with probability

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:59.292
2/9 + 2/9,2/9 at Gaddis,
2/9 at Spence for a total of

00:45:59.292 --> 00:46:04.091
4/9,
which means they failed to meet

00:46:04.091 --> 00:46:11.026
with probability--well if
they're meeting with probability

00:46:11.026 --> 00:46:17.718
of 4/9 what must be the
probability that they're failing

00:46:17.718 --> 00:46:21.289
to meet?
5/9, thank you.

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:26.380
So they fail to meet with
probability of 5/9.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:31.280
So Jake's expected payoff if he
sends them, the value for Jake

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:40.710
of this equilibrium is what?
So the value to Jake of this

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:49.236
Nash equilibrium,
if he sends them,

00:46:49.236 --> 00:47:00.520
is 4/9 x 1 + 5/9 x -1 for a
total of -1/9.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.797
Everyone okay with that?
So if Jake sends them they fail

00:47:05.797 --> 00:47:09.800
to meet 5/9 of the time and he
gets -1 each of those times.

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:13.267
They succeed in meeting 4/9 of
the time, he gets +1 each of

00:47:13.267 --> 00:47:15.539
those times, so his expected
payoff,

00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:19.911
his expected value from sending
Dave and Nina on the date is

00:47:19.911 --> 00:47:22.658
-1/9.
So from Jake's point of view,

00:47:22.658 --> 00:47:26.885
what this game looks like,
if he thinks that this is the

00:47:26.885 --> 00:47:31.342
Nash equilibrium being played:
if he doesn't send he gets 0

00:47:31.342 --> 00:47:37.008
and if he does,
he gets the value of this Nash

00:47:37.008 --> 00:47:42.650
equilibrium, which in this case
is -1/9.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:52.597
So he's not going to send and
the SPE here is (not send,

00:47:52.597 --> 00:47:59.469
"mix," "mix") where this is the
mix.

00:47:59.469 --> 00:48:03.049
So there's a third equilibrium
here in which our matchmaker

00:48:03.049 --> 00:48:06.813
says this hapless couple is just
too hapless: they're going to

00:48:06.813 --> 00:48:09.960
play the mixed strategy
equilibrium in which case it

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.170
isn't worth my while sending
them on the date.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:15.227
You guys were lucky because
Jake chose the other

00:48:15.227 --> 00:48:16.934
equilibrium.
He figured you were playing the

00:48:16.934 --> 00:48:18.557
other equilibrium,
which it turned out that you

00:48:18.557 --> 00:48:20.685
were.
So in this game there were

00:48:20.685 --> 00:48:24.447
three sub-game perfect
equilibria, one for each of the

00:48:24.447 --> 00:48:28.210
Nash equilibria in the sub-game,
as it turned out.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.961
There was one in which Jake
sent them and they coordinated

00:48:31.961 --> 00:48:35.449
on the pure strategy equilibrium
in the game (S,S).

00:48:35.449 --> 00:48:38.630
There was one in which Jake
sent them and they coordinated

00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:41.809
on the pure strategy equilibrium
in the sub-game (G,G).

00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:45.149
And there's one in which Jake
didn't send them,

00:48:45.149 --> 00:48:47.690
but had he had in fact sent
them,

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:51.034
they would have both mixed,
and hence, for a lot of the

00:48:51.034 --> 00:48:56.170
time, failed to coordinate.
Now, what's the big lesson here?

00:48:56.170 --> 00:48:59.339
The big lesson of the first
game we saw this morning was

00:48:59.339 --> 00:49:02.163
that sub-game perfect
equilibrium implies backward

00:49:02.163 --> 00:49:04.225
induction.
The big lesson of this

00:49:04.225 --> 00:49:07.707
game--other than the fact that
we're getting closer to getting

00:49:07.707 --> 00:49:11.189
Dave and Nina on their date--the
big lesson of this game is to

00:49:11.189 --> 00:49:14.099
show that to find sub-game
perfect equilibria,

00:49:14.099 --> 00:49:18.443
all you have to do is keep your
head and solve out the Nash

00:49:18.443 --> 00:49:21.289
equilibria in each of the
sub-games,

00:49:21.289 --> 00:49:25.310
roll the payoffs back up,
and then look for behavior up

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.761
the tree.
Once again, you look for the

00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:31.490
Nash equilibria in each of these
sub-games, roll the payoffs back

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.899
up,
and then see what the optimal

00:49:33.899 --> 00:49:38.299
moves are higher up the tree.
So we have time to do one more

00:49:38.299 --> 00:49:42.535
example, and the third example I
want to do is more of an

00:49:42.535 --> 00:49:43.670
application.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.110
So far we've seen some fairly
simple examples.

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.930
Now I want to do an application.

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:08.942
The application I want to do is
kind of a classic business

00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:12.379
school case if you like,
or a mini case involving

00:50:12.379 --> 00:50:14.170
strategic investment.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:25.900
The game is this,
or the setting is this.

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:29.869
There are two firms,
we'll call them A and B.

00:50:29.869 --> 00:50:33.239
And these two firms,
initially, before we start

00:50:33.239 --> 00:50:36.974
considering what we're actually
going to talk about,

00:50:36.974 --> 00:50:40.710
initially they are playing
Cournot competition.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:49.199
So two firms and they're
playing Cournot competition.

00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:55.329
And we can imagine that they're
producing fertilizer.

00:50:55.329 --> 00:51:03.107
And let's be specific here,
let's assume that the prices in

00:51:03.107 --> 00:51:11.152
this market are given by the
following demand curve 2 - 1/3 x

00:51:11.152 --> 00:51:15.221
[qA + qB],
so this is the demand curve

00:51:15.221 --> 00:51:21.631
that they face.
We'll assume that costs,

00:51:21.631 --> 00:51:30.150
marginal costs,
c is equal to $1 a ton.

00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:36.501
So this is the price in dollars
per ton, and the costs are $1

00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:39.191
per ton.
In a minute what we're going to

00:51:39.191 --> 00:51:41.980
do is we're going to consider a
change in this game,

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.146
but before we do that let's
just remind ourselves what the

00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:47.980
Cournot equilibrium of this game
would look like.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.816
Let's do a bit of a review.
So it's been a while since

00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.800
we've seen Cournot,
so let's remind ourselves.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:52:01.737
So I claim that the quantity,
the Cournot quantity chosen Q*

00:52:01.737 --> 00:52:08.110
has the formula [a--c]/ 3b.
Is that right?

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:09.909
If you go back in your notes
you'll find it.

00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:11.950
I'm not going to re-solve it
here.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:14.402
We've done it many times.
So [a--c]/3b trust me,

00:52:14.402 --> 00:52:18.530
is what came out of our
calculation before the mid-term.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.831
What I want to do is,
I just want to make sure we can

00:52:20.831 --> 00:52:22.380
translate that into numbers
here.

00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:24.921
Sorry for having it in letters,
but let's translate it into

00:52:24.921 --> 00:52:27.709
numbers.
So in particular,

00:52:27.709 --> 00:52:32.269
this a is this 2,
is that right?

00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:44.310
This c is this 1 and this b is
this 1/3, is that right?

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:52.081
So let's just put that down.
So in this case this is

00:52:52.081 --> 00:53:01.686
[2--1]/[3 x 1/3],
so this says that this is a

00:53:01.686 --> 00:53:06.818
million tons.
So the quantity here,

00:53:06.818 --> 00:53:10.330
the Cournot quantity is a
million tons each.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:13.965
So: one each.
So in this equilibrium,

00:53:13.965 --> 00:53:17.940
each of these two firms is
producing a million tons of

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:22.239
fertilizer.
What else do we know?

00:53:22.239 --> 00:53:24.840
We know therefore what prices
must be.

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:27.079
Let's just do that before we
even get started.

00:53:27.079 --> 00:53:31.922
So prices must be [2 - 1/3]
times the quantity that the

00:53:31.922 --> 00:53:37.034
first firm produces plus the
quantity that the second firm

00:53:37.034 --> 00:53:40.208
produces.
So that's 2 - 2/3 so that

00:53:40.208 --> 00:53:43.182
should be 4/3,
if I've got that right,

00:53:43.182 --> 00:53:51.491
or one and a third.
So prices here are $1.33 per

00:53:51.491 --> 00:53:58.900
ton.
Finally profits.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.694
So profit for each firm here,
in this equilibrium,

00:54:01.694 --> 00:54:05.059
before we even start the game,
or start the more interesting

00:54:05.059 --> 00:54:07.170
part of the game,
profit is what?

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:12.489
So they're going to get $1 and
1/3 for every ton they produce.

00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:17.572
It's going to cost them $1 to
produce each ton and they're

00:54:17.572 --> 00:54:21.139
producing one million of these
things.

00:54:21.139 --> 00:54:30.029
So their profits are 1/3,
if these are millions,

00:54:30.029 --> 00:54:38.730
their profits are 1/3 of $1
million dollars.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:42.449
So this is their per period
profit, in each period they're

00:54:42.449 --> 00:54:46.168
doing this, each year they're
doing this and this is their

00:54:46.168 --> 00:54:49.059
profits in each period.
So this is a simple model that

00:54:49.059 --> 00:54:50.837
we've done many times before.
This is Cournot,

00:54:50.837 --> 00:54:52.820
and now we're going to make it
more interesting.

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:59.339
If the algebra here was a bit
quick don't worry about it,

00:54:59.339 --> 00:55:01.242
check it at home,
it's just basic,

00:55:01.242 --> 00:55:05.876
basic algebra.
So now suppose that you are the

00:55:05.876 --> 00:55:10.433
manager of Firm A.
So it's a classic business

00:55:10.433 --> 00:55:12.351
school case.
I'm looking at my

00:55:12.351 --> 00:55:14.139
business-school students in the
balcony.

00:55:14.139 --> 00:55:19.991
You're the manager of Firm A
and you have to choose whether

00:55:19.991 --> 00:55:24.329
to accept an offer to rent a new
machine.

00:55:24.329 --> 00:55:28.260
So this new machine has two
features.

00:55:33.539 --> 00:55:39.212
The first--well three
features--the first feature is

00:55:39.212 --> 00:55:42.518
it only works for A.
So this machine is being

00:55:42.518 --> 00:55:45.068
offered to you.
It wouldn't fit in to Firm B's

00:55:45.068 --> 00:55:48.300
technology, so this is only
being offered for A.

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:55.654
The second feature of this
machine is it costs $0.7 million

00:55:55.654 --> 00:55:59.777
dollars in rental.
So each year you rent this

00:55:59.777 --> 00:56:02.770
machine, you'd have to pay $0.7
million dollars.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:12.704
But that's the bad news.
The good news is it will lower

00:56:12.704 --> 00:56:20.679
A's costs to $0.50 a ton.
So classic business-school

00:56:20.679 --> 00:56:22.829
situation.
You're the manager of a firm.

00:56:22.829 --> 00:56:25.534
You're involved in competition
with another firm,

00:56:25.534 --> 00:56:27.320
B.
And suddenly an opportunity

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.690
comes along to rent some new
technology.

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:33.886
It's going to cost you $0.7 a
year to rent this machine,

00:56:33.886 --> 00:56:37.320
but it will lower your costs by
$.50 a ton.

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:40.518
So this is a classic thing that
you might be asked in your

00:56:40.518 --> 00:56:42.820
interview for Morgan Stanley
next week.

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.537
How many of you are
interviewing with investment

00:56:44.537 --> 00:56:46.409
banks?
No one's going to admit it.

00:56:46.409 --> 00:56:49.195
In a couple of years,
when you're interviewing with

00:56:49.195 --> 00:56:51.280
these guys.
So what's the obvious question?

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:55.305
The obvious question is,
should you go ahead and rent

00:56:55.305 --> 00:57:01.280
this new technology or not?
Should you rent it or not?

00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.930
To rent or not to rent?

00:57:08.369 --> 00:57:12.089
Less dramatic than it's
equivalent question in the

00:57:12.089 --> 00:57:15.429
English class,
but important nevertheless.

00:57:15.429 --> 00:57:19.238
This board is stuck
unfortunately,

00:57:19.238 --> 00:57:23.969
so I'll have to write there a
bit more.

00:57:23.969 --> 00:57:29.311
So what I want to do is I want
to analyze this three times and

00:57:29.311 --> 00:57:33.370
each time I analyze it,
I want us to see what I'm

00:57:33.370 --> 00:57:37.710
doing--what mistakes I'm
making--because I want you guys,

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:40.151
when you interview with Morgan
Stanley about this kind of

00:57:40.151 --> 00:57:42.855
thing, to impress them so that
they tell lots of people to come

00:57:42.855 --> 00:57:45.210
to Yale and preferably give lots
of money to Yale.

00:57:45.210 --> 00:57:48.409
So we're going to look at this
way three different times.

00:57:48.409 --> 00:57:51.190
And the first thing we're going
to do, the first way we're going

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:53.750
to look at this is look at it as
if we were accountants.

00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:00.241
We're going to look at the
accountants' answer to this

00:58:00.241 --> 00:58:02.162
question, and some of you may
decide you don't want to

00:58:02.162 --> 00:58:03.829
interview with Morgan Stanley or
McKinsey,

00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:07.704
you might want to interview
with some accounting firm when

00:58:07.704 --> 00:58:10.699
you leave Yale.
God forbid, but you might.

00:58:10.699 --> 00:58:14.257
So let's have a look at how the
accountants would answer this

00:58:14.257 --> 00:58:16.450
question.
So I think the accountants

00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:20.255
would do this.
They would say--but before we

00:58:20.255 --> 00:58:24.706
do this let's have a poll.
How many people think you

00:58:24.706 --> 00:58:26.547
should rent?
You've had some time to think

00:58:26.547 --> 00:58:28.301
about it now.
So how many people think you

00:58:28.301 --> 00:58:31.369
should rent the new machine?
How many people think you

00:58:31.369 --> 00:58:35.173
should not rent the new machine?
You're not allowed abstensions

00:58:35.173 --> 00:58:36.267
here.
Let's try it again:

00:58:36.267 --> 00:58:38.911
no abstentions right.
You can't abstain in an

00:58:38.911 --> 00:58:41.226
interview.
So you're on the spot,

00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:44.876
you're in the boardroom,
how many think you should rent

00:58:44.876 --> 00:58:46.680
the new machine?
Raise your hands.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.486
Wave them in the air.
How many people think you

00:58:49.486 --> 00:58:53.008
should not rent the new machine?
So we're split kind of down the

00:58:53.008 --> 00:58:56.129
middle, I'm looking at my MBA
students to see which they

00:58:56.129 --> 00:58:57.971
voted.
Which did you guys vote,

00:58:57.971 --> 00:59:00.809
rent or not rent?
Rent, the MBA's seem to think

00:59:00.809 --> 00:59:02.429
rent.
We'll see if that's right.

00:59:02.429 --> 00:59:05.909
So let's move forward,
so accountant's answer.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:08.503
So I think what the
accountant's going to say is

00:59:08.503 --> 00:59:11.273
this.
They're going to say,

00:59:11.273 --> 00:59:16.949
right now you're producing a
million tons a year.

00:59:16.949 --> 00:59:22.280
The new machine saves you--so,
let's put per annum--let's try

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:26.190
and be fancy--so a million tons
per annum.

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:33.750
The new machine saves you $.50
per ton.

00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:37.497
So if you rent this new
machine, you're producing a

00:59:37.497 --> 00:59:41.170
million tons a year,
it's going to save you $.50 a

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:46.411
ton.
So it's going to save you half

00:59:46.411 --> 00:59:52.599
of one million a year in
variable cost.

00:59:52.599 --> 00:59:56.218
Those people who were in 115 or
150 will know what I mean by

00:59:56.218 --> 00:59:58.837
variable cost.
It's the cost you're going to

00:59:58.837 --> 01:00:01.659
save in the actual production of
your fertilizer.

01:00:01.659 --> 01:00:05.219
So it saves you half a million
a year.

01:00:05.219 --> 01:00:13.500
Unfortunately,
it costs you the cost of the

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:24.539
machine, which is a fixed cost
of $0.7 million a year.

01:00:24.539 --> 01:00:29.370
And .7 is bigger than .5,
so you should not rent.

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:42.000
So .5 is less than .7 so don't
rent the machine.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.070
How many of you said no?
That's kind of the back of the

01:00:45.070 --> 01:00:47.619
envelope calculation you were
doing, is that right?

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:50.359
Kind of the back of the
envelope calculation that

01:00:50.359 --> 01:00:53.480
accountants do.
So what's going on here?

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.614
Our business school student up
in the balcony says you should

01:00:56.614 --> 01:00:57.789
rent.
He took accounting.

01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:59.795
I know he did that because you
have to take accounting at

01:00:59.795 --> 01:01:01.500
business school.
So what's wrong?

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.740
Did he fail accounting,
or is this answer wrong?

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:09.291
The answer is wrong.
There's two things you need to

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.376
know about accountants.
One is that they're usually

01:01:12.376 --> 01:01:16.449
boring, and the other is that
they're often wrong.

01:01:16.449 --> 01:01:20.589
They're more often boring than
wrong, but they're almost always

01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:22.799
boring.
So this answer is kind of

01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:25.440
boring, and it happens also to
be wrong.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:29.938
Why is it wrong?
It's wrong because we made an

01:01:29.938 --> 01:01:33.329
assumption here that's not a
good assumption.

01:01:33.329 --> 01:01:38.528
We made the assumption that
you're going to go on producing

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:43.546
the same amount per year after
you've invested in the new

01:01:43.546 --> 01:01:48.386
machine that lowers marginal
costs as you are producing

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:51.619
beforehand.
We made the assumption that it

01:01:51.619 --> 01:01:54.811
would lower--we know it lowers
your costs--and we assumed

01:01:54.811 --> 01:01:58.630
implicitly that you would go on
producing a million tons a year,

01:01:58.630 --> 01:02:01.599
but that's not right.
So let's try and have a more

01:02:01.599 --> 01:02:03.915
sophisticated answer,
and if you want to be more

01:02:03.915 --> 01:02:06.329
sophisticated and less boring
than accounting,

01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:08.079
what class would you want to
take?

01:02:08.079 --> 01:02:11.023
Economics probably right,
so let's have a look at an

01:02:11.023 --> 01:02:13.769
Economics answer.
Let's look at an Economics 115

01:02:13.769 --> 01:02:14.210
answer.

01:02:18.210 --> 01:02:20.139
How many of you have taken
Economics 115?

01:02:20.139 --> 01:02:24.110
How many of you are in 115 at
the moment?

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.503
Quite a few,
okay so let's have a look at

01:02:26.503 --> 01:02:30.387
the Economics answer.
Let's see why that previous

01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:37.657
answer was wrong.
So here is qA and here is cost

01:02:37.657 --> 01:02:44.559
of a $1, your new cost will be
$.50.

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:48.900
So I'm putting prices and costs
on this axis.

01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:53.210
And here is your residual
demand curve.

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:57.226
This is the demand curve you
face after the other guy has

01:02:57.226 --> 01:03:00.812
finished producing,
so this is your residual demand

01:03:00.812 --> 01:03:02.874
curve.
It's the demand curve on that

01:03:02.874 --> 01:03:05.517
part of the market you're
supplying, or not being supplied

01:03:05.517 --> 01:03:08.771
by the other side of the market.
And to figure out your optimal

01:03:08.771 --> 01:03:11.980
quantity on your residual demand
curve what you should do.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:17.423
It's like you're a monopolist
on this residual demand curve,

01:03:17.423 --> 01:03:21.049
so you should set what?
If the answer isn't backward

01:03:21.049 --> 01:03:23.875
induction it's probably marginal
revenue equals marginal cost

01:03:23.875 --> 01:03:25.360
right?
So let's try that.

01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:30.726
So here's the marginal revenue
curve roughly speaking,

01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:35.992
should be twice as steep.
This is residual marginal

01:03:35.992 --> 01:03:40.550
revenue and here's what you used
to produce.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:45.170
So we know what this is:
this was a million tons.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:47.389
This was marginal revenue
hitting marginal cost.

01:03:47.389 --> 01:03:52.816
Now your costs have gone down
so notice that your quantity,

01:03:52.816 --> 01:03:58.028
your new quantity has gone up.
Your new quantity has gone up

01:03:58.028 --> 01:04:02.158
because you slid down the
marginal revenue curve as the

01:04:02.158 --> 01:04:06.300
marginal cost curve dropped.
Is that clear to everybody?

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.542
So this is the kind of picture
that you probably saw a lot of

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:13.957
in 115, is that right?
Or in 150 for that matter,

01:04:13.957 --> 01:04:16.586
is that correct?
So notice in this picture we

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.739
can actually see the
accountant's answer,

01:04:18.739 --> 01:04:22.786
the boring answer.
The boring answer is this

01:04:22.786 --> 01:04:27.115
rectangle.
This rectangle,

01:04:27.115 --> 01:04:35.957
this is the accounting answer.
This rectangle is 0.5 x 1,

01:04:35.957 --> 01:04:41.150
so it comes out as a 1/2 and
that was the accountant's

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:43.270
answer.
And what did they miss.

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:52.949
What did the accountant's miss?
They missed the triangle.

01:04:52.949 --> 01:04:56.058
So I told you they were boring,
they were a little bit square,

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:59.312
so they tend to miss triangles.
So here's the triangle that

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:02.320
they missed.
So we missed this triangle.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.203
And how big is this triangle?
Well we could do it at home,

01:05:11.203 --> 01:05:13.880
it's 1/2 base x height.
So we could figure this out.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:17.191
We know the slope of this line.
We know the slope of this line

01:05:17.191 --> 01:05:19.883
is 1/3.
We know the slope of this line

01:05:19.883 --> 01:05:22.737
is 2/3.
We know that the height of this

01:05:22.737 --> 01:05:25.814
triangle is 1/2.
We could figure out what the

01:05:25.814 --> 01:05:28.976
width is as well,
therefore we could do half base

01:05:28.976 --> 01:05:33.966
times height.
Turns out that this has area--I

01:05:33.966 --> 01:05:42.219
did this at home so let me just
write it down--it has area 3/16.

01:05:42.219 --> 01:05:44.941
So again, everyone could figure
out the area of a triangle at

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.273
home, is that right?
You all know that from your

01:05:47.273 --> 01:05:49.150
probably junior high school
geometry.

01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:54.253
So assuming I did it correctly
at home, this is 3/16 which is

01:05:54.253 --> 01:06:01.420
approximately 0.19.
So we missed this 0.19.

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:06.121
So how are we doing now?
So we know from the accounting

01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:12.258
answer we had a 1/2 in savings.
We know from the Economics

01:06:12.258 --> 01:06:18.088
answer that we should add
another 0.19 to this--that's the

01:06:18.088 --> 01:06:24.224
triangle--for a total of 0.69
but unfortunately this is still

01:06:24.224 --> 01:06:29.440
less than .7 which is the cost
of the machine,

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:31.889
the per annum cost of the
machine.

01:06:31.889 --> 01:06:34.360
So it looks like we should
still not rent.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.826
So even after taking Economics
115, which is a good thing to

01:06:41.826 --> 01:06:44.796
do--it is much less boring than
accounting and will get you the

01:06:44.796 --> 01:06:47.670
accounting answer anyway if you
do things carefully--we still

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.730
end up concluding you shouldn't
rent.

01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:53.588
But our guy from the business
school said you should rent,

01:06:53.588 --> 01:06:55.693
right?
So did he fail Economics as

01:06:55.693 --> 01:06:58.300
well as accounting,
or is this answer wrong?

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.010
This answer is still wrong.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.830
[I didn't really want to delete
that.

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:26.630
That's a shame.
Oh well, I've done it now.

01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:28.360
People've got those numbers
somewhere.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:37.630
I hope they are in my notes.]
This answer is still wrong.

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:42.510
We need to get the right answer.
So what we need is a third

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:49.596
answer which is the Game Theory
answer, which is also known as

01:07:49.596 --> 01:07:51.920
the right answer.

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.352
What are we missing?
What's wrong with the Economics

01:08:01.352 --> 01:08:03.659
answer?
Somebody?

01:08:03.659 --> 01:08:06.760
Everyone knew it was wrong,
why is it wrong?

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.290
It looked pretty good,
what's wrong with it?

01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:11.873
Let's bounce down here.
Somebody in the front row will

01:08:11.873 --> 01:08:14.869
help me.
What did I do wrong?

01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:17.109
Student: Firm B also
changes its quantity.

01:08:17.109 --> 01:08:20.425
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, in the accounting

01:08:20.425 --> 01:08:24.130
answer, we assumed that Firm A
kept its quantity fixed,

01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:25.949
that we kept our quantity
fixed, and that was wrong.

01:08:25.949 --> 01:08:28.847
But in addition,
Firm B is going to change its

01:08:28.847 --> 01:08:31.649
quantity, isn't it?
Firm B is going to change its

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.050
quantity.
Let's remind ourselves why.

01:08:34.050 --> 01:08:41.408
We're still playing Cournot
competition, here's our Cournot

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:46.768
diagram with qA and qB.
So prior to making this

01:08:46.768 --> 01:08:50.100
investment the model is
symmetric.

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:54.641
Here it is.
And this is the old best

01:08:54.641 --> 01:09:01.163
response of Firm A,
and this is the best response

01:09:01.163 --> 01:09:06.856
of Firm B.
What we learned just now in the

01:09:06.856 --> 01:09:11.969
Economics answer is what?
We learned that Firm A,

01:09:11.969 --> 01:09:15.687
as its costs go down,
will produce more for each

01:09:15.687 --> 01:09:19.010
possible quantity that Firm B
produces.

01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:24.572
So regardless of what generated
this residual demand curve as

01:09:24.572 --> 01:09:29.950
the costs go down for Firm A,
it increases its quantity.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:34.170
So we know that.
So what's that telling us?

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:43.672
It's telling us that the new
best response of Firm A is

01:09:43.672 --> 01:09:49.856
shifted to the right.
This is the new best response

01:09:49.856 --> 01:09:51.699
for Firm A.
It's shifted to the right.

01:09:51.699 --> 01:09:55.372
It now produces more for any
given quantity that Firm B

01:09:55.372 --> 01:09:59.750
produces.
So qA has gone up.

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:00.550
That was our Economics answer.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:12.160
But that leads Firm B to do
what?

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:17.350
To produce less.
That leads to qB producing less.

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:22.813
Notice we slid down Firm B's
best response line from the old

01:10:22.813 --> 01:10:26.239
equilibrium to the new
equilibrium,

01:10:26.239 --> 01:10:31.210
and at the new equilibrium Firm
B's production has gone down.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:35.521
By the way, what kind of game
is it where as Firm A increases

01:10:35.521 --> 01:10:38.540
its strategy,
Firm B decreases its strategy

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:41.381
in response?
Strategic substitutes,

01:10:41.381 --> 01:10:44.035
right.
So because this is a game of

01:10:44.035 --> 01:10:47.403
strategic substitutes--good
interview word,

01:10:47.403 --> 01:10:51.733
good word to mention in an
interview--because this is a

01:10:51.733 --> 01:10:57.103
game of strategic substitutes,
we know that Firm B reduces its

01:10:57.103 --> 01:11:00.349
quantity.
As Firm B reduces its quantity

01:11:00.349 --> 01:11:05.220
is that good for A or bad for A?
It's good for A, right?

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:17.529
This is good for Firm A,
it softens competition.

01:11:17.529 --> 01:11:21.606
As a consequence,
it leads to an increase in

01:11:21.606 --> 01:11:24.223
profit.
Again--we don't have time

01:11:24.223 --> 01:11:28.386
today--but what we could do is
we could go back and we could

01:11:28.386 --> 01:11:31.420
recalculate the new Cournot
equilibrium.

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:38.111
We could calculate this--we
could as a homework exercise try

01:11:38.111 --> 01:11:44.690
it--calculate the new Nash
equilibrium and notice this is a

01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:51.529
Nash equilibrium in a sub-game.
Why is this a sub-game?

01:11:51.529 --> 01:11:55.779
Because Firm A made its
decision whether to buy this new

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:59.409
machine or not,
and then they played Cournot.

01:11:59.409 --> 01:12:01.743
So the Cournot game,
the game up here,

01:12:01.743 --> 01:12:07.000
what is this?
This is the sub-game.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.140
This is the diagram of the
sub-game, if you like.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.180
It's the best responses of the
sub-game.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.997
So what sub-game perfection
tells us to do here is first of

01:12:21.997 --> 01:12:25.159
all, work out the new
equilibrium in the sub-game,

01:12:25.159 --> 01:12:29.540
work out how much that new
equilibrium is worth for Firm A

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:33.460
and then roll it back to the
investment decision.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:46.229
It turns out when we do that we
get an extra $.31 million.

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:51.090
So we could do it at home,
we get an extra $.31 million.

01:12:51.090 --> 01:12:53.962
So it turns out that our MBA
student was right,

01:12:53.962 --> 01:12:58.250
good.
It turns out that if you add

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:04.162
this .31 to the .69 we had
already we get 1,

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:12.274
which of course is much bigger
than .7 and indeed you should

01:13:12.274 --> 01:13:17.070
rent the machine.
Now, I want you to have two

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:19.300
take away lessons from this
game.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:21.939
The first take away lesson is
this.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:25.282
When you're analyzing a game
like this, be it in the real

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:28.743
world or in a job interview,
the first thing you want to do

01:13:28.743 --> 01:13:30.630
is what?
You want to look at the

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.566
sub-game.
You want to look at what would

01:13:33.566 --> 01:13:37.611
happen if you did invest and
solve out the new Nash

01:13:37.611 --> 01:13:42.504
equilibrium in that sub-game.
Then you want to roll back the

01:13:42.504 --> 01:13:47.191
value of that sub-game back into
the initial decision which is

01:13:47.191 --> 01:13:51.263
the strategic investment
decision whether to rent this

01:13:51.263 --> 01:13:55.587
machine or not.
So schematically,

01:13:55.587 --> 01:14:02.474
the game looks like this:
rent or not rent,

01:14:02.474 --> 01:14:08.870
and in either case you play
Cournot.

01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:13.176
There's a sub-game in each case.
In this case you play symmetric

01:14:13.176 --> 01:14:16.890
Cournot, when you both have the
same costs;

01:14:16.890 --> 01:14:22.485
and here you play asymmetric
Cournot, where you have

01:14:22.485 --> 01:14:25.841
different costs.
And the way we analyze this

01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:28.041
game is, we solve out the
symmetric Cournot,

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:31.341
we actually did that up front.
We now solve out the new

01:14:31.341 --> 01:14:34.228
equilibrium in this asymmetric
Cournot game,

01:14:34.228 --> 01:14:38.470
this one here.
This is the old one and this is

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.770
the new one.
Solve it out.

01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:42.890
Work out how much profit you're
going to get.

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:47.536
And roll that back remembering
that it costs you $.7 million to

01:14:47.536 --> 01:14:50.338
make this step.
So that's the first take away

01:14:50.338 --> 01:14:52.328
lesson.
But the second take away lesson

01:14:52.328 --> 01:14:54.504
is more general,
so let me just pause to get

01:14:54.504 --> 01:14:56.630
everyone to wake up again so I
make it.

01:14:56.630 --> 01:15:01.090
The second take away lesson is
this., What tips the balance

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:05.396
here from the Economics answer
and the accounting answer,

01:15:05.396 --> 01:15:10.470
were the strategic effects.
It was the strategic effect.

01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.060
This is a strategic effect.

01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:24.932
It was the effect of the other
firm or other players changing

01:15:24.932 --> 01:15:28.509
their behavior.
And the most common mistake to

01:15:28.509 --> 01:15:32.819
make when you're thinking about
strategic decisions is what?

01:15:32.819 --> 01:15:34.800
It's to forget that they're
strategic.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:38.505
It's to forget that the other
players are going to change

01:15:38.505 --> 01:15:40.750
their behavior.
In this example,

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:44.739
the other firm cuts back its
production so much as to make

01:15:44.739 --> 01:15:48.423
that investment profitable.
But let me give you two other

01:15:48.423 --> 01:15:50.529
examples.
Example number one.

01:15:50.529 --> 01:15:53.689
You're designing a tax policy
for the U.S..

01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:58.598
The dumb way to analyze this is
to say look at what people are

01:15:58.598 --> 01:16:02.300
doing now, push through the new
tax numbers,

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:05.491
and act like an accountant and
crunch out how much money the

01:16:05.491 --> 01:16:08.760
government's going to make.
Why is that wrong?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:12.653
Because you're forgetting that
as you change the tax code

01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:16.199
people's behavior changes.
Incentives change and people's

01:16:16.199 --> 01:16:18.420
behavior changes.
It leads to a mistake in

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:21.465
designing the tax code.
You need to take into account

01:16:21.465 --> 01:16:23.989
strategic effects:
how behavior changes.

01:16:23.989 --> 01:16:27.010
Example number two,
closer to home.

01:16:27.010 --> 01:16:29.369
You're designing a new
curriculum for Yale.

01:16:29.369 --> 01:16:33.033
So you change the rules of the
curriculum and when analyzing it

01:16:33.033 --> 01:16:36.578
you say--I wouldn't say this but
some people on the committee

01:16:36.578 --> 01:16:39.060
might say this--under these new
rules,

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:42.217
if we look at what people used
to do, they will now do more of

01:16:42.217 --> 01:16:44.698
this and less of that,
and they'll learn this and

01:16:44.698 --> 01:16:46.439
learn that.
What are you missing?

01:16:46.439 --> 01:16:50.304
You're missing that students
are players and students change

01:16:50.304 --> 01:16:53.710
their behavior as you change the
curriculum rules.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:57.220
So the biggest lesson of
today's class is don't be like

01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:00.079
an accountant,
partly because it's boring and

01:17:00.079 --> 01:17:03.684
you won't go on your date,
and partly because you'll miss

01:17:03.684 --> 01:17:06.000
out on these important strategic
effects.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:09.000
We'll come back and look at
more on Wednesday.

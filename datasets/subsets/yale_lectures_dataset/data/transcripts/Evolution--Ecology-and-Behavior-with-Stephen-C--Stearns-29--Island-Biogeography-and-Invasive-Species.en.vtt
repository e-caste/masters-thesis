00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.479
Prof: You guys had a
little bit of fun getting

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.100
dressed up and doing some stuff
up on stage last Friday,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.871
and so I though that I would
actually have a little fun

00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.500
myself.
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.644
And I was unable,
as you know,

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:16.860
to decide which section had
actually done the best job.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.460
So I decided that you would all
get a reward.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.590
And in order to understand the
reward,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.767
I want to give you the
background, which actually comes

00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:29.204
from a very,
of course, deep theoretical

00:00:29.204 --> 00:00:35.260
investigation of the kind that I
always want you to know about.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.530
Right?
 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.330
So let me get this up there.
 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.780
Here we go.
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.040
I want you to understand the
Swiss theorem.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.720
Okay?
 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.574
And the Swiss theorem is really
a very essential part of

00:00:54.574 --> 00:00:56.810
population biology.
 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.670
Basically it tells you that the
partial derivative of happiness,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.570
with respect to an increase in
chocolate intake,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.581
is positive across the entire
reaction norm of the human

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:06.239
condition.
 

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.000
Okay?
 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.750
So chocolate makes you happier,
right?

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.210
And the Swiss,
as is usual,

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.525
claim priority for something
which is in fact a contribution

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:17.730
of another major civilization,
which is the Mexicans.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.135
Now, you will notice that I
have had the teaching fellows

00:01:22.135 --> 00:01:26.620
divvy up the chocolate onto
paper plates and distribute it

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.688
in small qualities around the
room.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:33.554
This is because the
homogenization of fitness within

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:37.947
groups promotes group benefit
and causes a general increase

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:39.540
in-group success.
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.578
Because the only way then that
the group can improve is that if

00:01:43.578 --> 00:01:46.640
the performance of the
individuals increases the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.920
performance of the whole group.
 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.992
Now, that's about all that I
really want to say,

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:58.280
except that I want to thank you
very much for participating in

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.879
that exercise last Friday.
 

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.129
I thought it was interesting.
 

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.890
I enjoyed it.
 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.700
I hope you've had a chance to
look at it.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.000
And the only issue that now
faces me is whether I should

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.818
continue to give the lecture in
this costume.

00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:14.224
I have been told by my teaching
fellows that I absolutely have

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:14.840
to do it.
 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.770
Right?
 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.926
But I have difficulty believing
that you'll believe me if I look

00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:20.720
like this.
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.979
Will you believe me?
 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:23.960
Students:  Yes.
 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.349
Prof: You want me to
leave it on?

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.840
Students:  Yes.
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.889
Prof: All right,
all right.

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:28.400
Let's go.
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
Okay?
 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.810
So we're actually now going to
go back to--

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.751
oh by the way,
there is a pedagogical message

00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:37.323
in this costume,
and that is if you can't play

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.530
like a child,
you can't be creative.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.120
Okay?
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.370
It's about playfulness.
 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.030
Okay.
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.740
Have you all got your chocolate?
 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.770
Are you happy?
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:51.560
Students:  Yes.
 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.720
Prof: Or let me put it
this way, are you happier?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.348
&gt;
 

00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:02.862
It looks like we have some
leftovers, and so you're all

00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:06.038
welcome to grab some on the way
out.

00:03:06.038 --> 00:03:09.032
The basket, by the way,
is a working basket from a

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:12.514
market in the Ivory Coast,
and when people make baskets to

00:03:12.514 --> 00:03:15.080
work with, they make them really
well.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.979
So I don't want the basket to
disappear.

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:20.560
Okay?
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.758
Now for today's lecture.
 

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:27.857
What we're looking at now is
the impact of space on

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:31.790
communities and on the
distribution of plants and

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.250
animals around the planet.
 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.506
So I'm going to talk today
about island biogeography and

00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:39.900
metapopulations.
 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.645
And I want you to start
thinking of the world as

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:45.160
fragmented, okay?
 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.660
So, as spatially heterogeneous.
 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.760
There are islands,
there are mountains,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.310
there are lakes and oases.
 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.340
And a lot of the world is
becoming fragmented by humans.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.567
So one of the big ways that
humans are having impact on the

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.961
planet, and changing life on the
planet, is by fragmenting the

00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.740
landscape.
 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.336
So the issue today is what is
determining biodiversity in a

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:08.210
fragment?
 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.280
What happens when we break the
world up?

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.696
Here are some sketches of what
happened in Cadiz Township,

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:24.250
Wisconsin, between 1831 and
1950.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.745
So before the settlers go out,
we had an Eastern Hardwood

00:04:27.745 --> 00:04:30.065
Forest,
and as the area got

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:33.843
settled--this is 1882,
1902,1950--you can see the

00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:37.738
forest disappears and there are
little blocks of tress that are

00:04:37.738 --> 00:04:41.230
left as forest fragments,
scattered across the landscape.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.574
And this is where the birds and
the rodents and the coyotes and

00:04:45.574 --> 00:04:49.709
everything else now--and the
deer--have to try to make their

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:50.480
living.
 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.220
And if we now look at Wisconsin
from space--

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.120
so this is in the early part of
this century--

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.000
you can see a picture which
actually has cities in it,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.540
in red, and a landscape,
which is largely agricultural,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.778
with some little dark blocks of
forest scattered through it.

00:05:09.778 --> 00:05:11.670
So this is mostly agriculture
here;

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.899
this would be forest.
 

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:15.660
Let's take another look.
 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.130
Another kind of natural
fragmentation,

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.670
of course, is archipelagos,
islands.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.680
Now we're getting towards
island biogeography.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.574
This is an observation made by
Robert MacArthur and Ed Wilson

00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:31.838
that plots on the Y-axis,
on a log scale,

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:35.019
the number of species on an
island;

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:39.990
and on the X-axis the area of
the island, in square miles.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.790
And this is for the Sunda
Islands;

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.230
so this is in Indonesia.
 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.699
And up here you've got the
Philippines and New Guinea,

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:49.600
added to the Sunda Islands.
 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.916
So what you see is that on a
log-log plot,

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:54.459
the bigger the island the more
the species.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:57.459
And this is the part of the
world we're talking about.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:06:00.350
Komodo dragons come from Komodo
here.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.670
The little dwarf Homo erectus
was found on Flores.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.610
This is Timor.
 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.588
New Guinea is going to be off
here somewhere.

00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:11.019
Java is over there,
and Krakatoa is down here.

00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:14.180
So these are the Sunda Islands.
 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.399
And they have lots of different
surface areas.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:19.812
I mean, if you just look at
this little one and compare it

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:22.326
to this big one,
you're going to have a lot

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:25.139
fewer birds on there than you
are on there.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.209
So in trying to come up with a
general theory of biogeography,

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:34.391
MacArthur and Wilson did the
standard Cartesian analytical

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:37.283
reduction of saying,
"What are the essential

00:06:37.283 --> 00:06:38.360
features of that system?
 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.220
What are the fewest things that
we have to pay attention to,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.680
that will tell us something,
a take-home message,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.685
some key message,
that we can pull out of the

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:49.370
system?"
 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.091
And they thought,
well let's suppose that there

00:06:53.091 --> 00:06:57.120
isn't any evolution going on,
and that all of the species

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.004
we're considering already exist
on some big continental

00:07:00.004 --> 00:07:02.473
landmass,
and that they're getting onto

00:07:02.473 --> 00:07:04.800
islands in a process of
immigration,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.728
and they're dying out on
islands in a process of

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:08.540
extinction.
 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.925
And this is the number of
species that are present on the

00:07:11.925 --> 00:07:12.470
island.
 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.540
Okay?
 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.637
So they argued that in such a
situation the number of species

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.709
on the island will come to an
equilibrium--

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:23.180
there'll be species that are
coming off of the continents,

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.310
that are flying,
drifting, getting blown,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.494
whatever, out onto the
islands--and the immigration

00:07:28.494 --> 00:07:29.959
rate will start high.
 

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:33.519
When the island is empty,
everything that shows up on it

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:34.750
is a new species.
 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.430
But the immigration rate must
inevitably fall down to zero

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.305
when the number of species on
the island equals the number in

00:07:42.305 --> 00:07:44.629
the source pool on the mainland.
 

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:45.899
Okay?
 

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:47.940
Because we're just counting
species;

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.930
we're not counting number of
individuals arriving.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.494
I mean, if a hundred birds fly
in and their species already

00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.978
exists on the island,
that doesn't count for

00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:59.341
immigration,
because that species is already

00:07:59.341 --> 00:07:59.730
there.
 

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.519
So that's the way this axis is
constructed.

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:07.278
So this goes down and this goes
up.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:10.648
The number of species on the
island is going to be affecting

00:08:10.648 --> 00:08:13.160
the extinction rate,
probably in two ways.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.201
The simplest is the more
species there are,

00:08:15.201 --> 00:08:17.875
the greater the chance that one
of them will go extinct,

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:18.800
just at random.
 

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.564
So that curve's going to go up,
just because there are more

00:08:21.564 --> 00:08:22.709
species on the island.
 

00:08:22.709 --> 00:08:26.384
However, if there are
interactions among the species

00:08:26.384 --> 00:08:28.817
on the island,
such that predation,

00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:32.200
disease, whatever is going to
drive one to extinction,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.759
you can see that it might bend
upward.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.110
So it's not just going to be
linear, it's going to go up;

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.808
so that's how they argued the
curves.

00:08:38.808 --> 00:08:40.668
And they said where the curves
intersect,

00:08:40.668 --> 00:08:42.870
the number coming in will equal
the number going out,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.639
and that's the number we should
expect to find on the island.

00:08:45.639 --> 00:08:49.389
So far so good;
this is all just a priori.

00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:54.493
Well what's going to affect the
rates of immigration and

00:08:54.493 --> 00:08:55.700
extinction?
 

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.339
Well first they argued that
immigration will decrease from

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:02.979
islands that are near the
mainland out to islands that are

00:09:02.979 --> 00:09:04.639
far from the mainland.
 

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:07.190
So you could construct a series
of curves;

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.932
so this would be the curve for
an island close to the mainland

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:12.899
and this would be the curve for
an island far from the mainland.

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:15.350
And that's just because it's
harder to get out there.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.404
On the other hand,
they argued that extinction

00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:22.547
rates will increase as you go
from large islands down to small

00:09:22.547 --> 00:09:24.817
islands,
basically because there's more

00:09:24.817 --> 00:09:27.144
space on the big island,
more different niches,

00:09:27.144 --> 00:09:29.333
more places,
habitats, where organisms can

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:30.886
live;
more different kinds of things

00:09:30.886 --> 00:09:31.759
could survive there.
 

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.070
But also as you get onto a
small island,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:36.750
the intensity of the biotic
interactions are going to get

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:38.514
bigger,
and it's going to be harder to

00:09:38.514 --> 00:09:41.702
get away from a predator,
or harder to get away from a

00:09:41.702 --> 00:09:42.428
parasite.
 

00:09:42.428 --> 00:09:45.969
And so you could imagine that
as you shrank an island,

00:09:45.969 --> 00:09:48.038
extinction rates would go up.
 

00:09:48.038 --> 00:09:51.270
So they predicted,
hey, we could have an

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:55.912
equilibrium over here on an
island which is small and far

00:09:55.912 --> 00:09:59.291
from the coast,
or that we could have it here

00:09:59.291 --> 00:10:02.200
if it was a small island close
to the continent.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.004
And similarly if we have a
large island which is far away

00:10:06.004 --> 00:10:08.572
from the continent,
we might be down here,

00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:11.350
and a large island close to the
continent would be here.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.899
A big one close to a continent,
by the way, would be Trinidad.

00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:16.923
Trinidad has almost the
biodiversity of neighboring

00:10:16.923 --> 00:10:17.649
Venezuela.
 

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:21.070
A small one,
far away from a continent--

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.190
so with a very low
biodiversity--might be something

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.927
like,
you would think,

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:30.340
an isolated oceanic island like
Easter Island or Hawaii.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.480
So why is this important?
 

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.623
Well for a long time,
from the mid-1960s up to about

00:10:38.623 --> 00:10:44.080
1985,
1990, this was the only game in

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.303
town,
and there weren't alternative

00:10:47.303 --> 00:10:50.379
ways of thinking about these
processes,

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:53.394
and it played a big role in the
design of natural parks and

00:10:53.394 --> 00:10:54.330
nature reserves.
 

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.440
Essentially it said,
because of the area,

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.649
the effect of area on
biodiversity,

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:04.620
it's better to have a big park
than a small one,

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.432
and because of the effect of
immigration rate on

00:11:07.432 --> 00:11:10.217
biodiversity,
it said it's better to provide

00:11:10.217 --> 00:11:12.840
corridors to connect landscape
fragments,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.160
if you possibly can,
so that things can immigrate

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.960
and move back and forth.
 

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.580
So it was used a lot.
 

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.293
However, when we summarize it,
you'll see it's an equilibrium

00:11:27.293 --> 00:11:30.278
between colonization and
extinction;

00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:32.950
it assumes there's a source
population.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.488
So evolution isn't going on;
there's a source population out

00:11:36.488 --> 00:11:38.960
there, that's where all the
species are.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:41.240
There's no speciation occurring
on islands.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.120
There are just two effects that
you're worried about:

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.000
how big the island is and how
far away it is from the

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:47.720
mainland.
 

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.032
Extinction is driven by area,
and colonization is driven by

00:11:52.032 --> 00:11:52.850
distance.
 

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.139
Okay?
 

00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:58.230
Now all of these things that
I've just written down here will

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.980
be important for you to remember
if you are asked how to

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.868
reconstruct the equilibrium
number of species on an island

00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:08.049
in a certain circumstance.
 

00:12:08.049 --> 00:12:09.639
Okay?
 

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:11.450
I want to emphasize that.
 

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:14.820
That's the kind of thing that
might turn up on a midterm.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:21.620
If you're on a small island,
a long way from the mainland,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.783
you'll have low species
diversity, and a big island

00:12:23.783 --> 00:12:26.250
close to the mainland will have
high species diversity.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.668
And that seems to be an
intuitive point,

00:12:28.668 --> 00:12:31.894
but I've given you an
analytical framework from which

00:12:31.894 --> 00:12:32.950
to derive it.
 

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:39.682
Now, as you'll see in a minute,
I am now going to blast this

00:12:39.682 --> 00:12:42.649
theory out of the water.
 

00:12:42.649 --> 00:12:46.174
I'm going to take it apart and
show that it makes a whole

00:12:46.174 --> 00:12:50.330
series of assumptions and claims
that are demonstrably not true.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.347
And before I do that,
I want to signal to you that

00:12:53.347 --> 00:12:55.745
I'm going to come back,
after I do that,

00:12:55.745 --> 00:12:59.090
and say, "Hey,
it was still a good thing."

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.460
Okay?
 

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.090
So the theory is dealing only
with the number of species,

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.490
not with the number of
individuals;

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.110
there's no population dynamics.
 

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.120
I mean, if you've got ten of
them on the island,

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.647
or a thousand of them on the
island, you count them the same

00:13:13.647 --> 00:13:13.990
way.
 

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.653
That seems to be a little
silly, because the probably of

00:13:17.653 --> 00:13:21.649
extinction should be related to
the number that are there.

00:13:21.649 --> 00:13:25.097
All the species are considered
together, and there's just kind

00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:28.830
of one general immigration rate
and one general extinction rate.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.350
You know, it's kind of fun to
wave my arms when I've got this

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.769
gown on.
 

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.110
&gt;
 

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:36.750
But the probabilities of
immigration and extinction are

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:38.799
different;
I mean, it's going to be

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:41.693
different for birds and ants and
mosses and paramecia and

00:13:41.693 --> 00:13:43.244
elephants and stuff like that.
 

00:13:43.244 --> 00:13:43.710
Okay?
 

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:47.110
So they must some ways differ
systematically.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.297
The island biogeographic
theory, kind of like the

00:13:50.297 --> 00:13:53.552
Hardy-Weinberg theory,
it's an equilibrium theory.

00:13:53.552 --> 00:13:54.149
Okay?
 

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:55.788
It doesn't allow for history.
 

00:13:55.788 --> 00:13:59.020
But if we just look at what's
happened in the Western Pacific

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.927
in the last 10,000 years,
as the Polynesians came out and

00:14:01.927 --> 00:14:04.628
colonized those islands,
we know that 25% of the birds

00:14:04.628 --> 00:14:07.000
that were on them have already
gone extinct.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.351
So you send your budding
biogeographer out there to get a

00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:13.524
sample from the Sunda Islands or
from Guam or from the

00:14:13.524 --> 00:14:17.029
Philippines or Micronesia,
and they come back with a count

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:19.480
of the number of bird species on
the island,

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.552
it's a very misleading count
because 25% extinction has

00:14:23.552 --> 00:14:26.269
already happened on those
islands.

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:29.274
And that's where those data
came from, that I showed you.

00:14:29.274 --> 00:14:29.649
Okay?
 

00:14:29.649 --> 00:14:35.120
This effect has not been
compensated for in that dataset.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.018
The theory doesn't allow for
speciation and adaptive

00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:38.700
radiation.
 

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.508
And you take one pair of
cardueline finches from Central

00:14:42.508 --> 00:14:45.139
America and fly them out to
Hawaii,

00:14:45.139 --> 00:14:46.730
fifteen or twenty million years
ago,

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.850
and voilà,
this is what they produce--

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.149
okay?--bunches of species.
 

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:55.570
So that's going on,
and that's not in the theory.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.990
It assumes that the probability
of being able to immigrate

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:02.289
doesn't depend on how many
species are already there.

00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:03.570
Okay?
 

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:06.283
But the presence of some
species is probably a

00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:09.899
prerequisite for that of others,
and the presence of some may

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:11.769
keep others from coming in.
 

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:14.668
So those are probably effects
to worry about.

00:15:14.668 --> 00:15:18.308
It's actually empirically
difficult to decide when an

00:15:18.308 --> 00:15:20.200
immigration has occurred.
 

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.399
So you're sitting here,
out in the Thimble Islands,

00:15:22.399 --> 00:15:24.365
okay, off Branford,
Connecticut,

00:15:24.365 --> 00:15:27.671
and it's spring,
and a Bay-breasted Warbler

00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:29.450
comes flying through.
 

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.840
Do you count it?
 

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.899
Well it's going to just stop
off, eat a few insects,

00:15:33.899 --> 00:15:35.279
and fly on to Canada.
 

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:37.029
It's just passing through.
 

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:37.860
Is that immigration?
 

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.500
Probably not.
 

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.145
So you have to actually find
the species that breed on the

00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:47.690
island;
that's not so easy.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.029
We assume the system's at
equilibrium.

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:53.480
But how can we recognize an
equilibrium when we've got one?

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.350
There's not a clear prediction
on how fast this turnover would

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.120
occur.
 

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.436
Or do we have to wait ten
generation, a hundred

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.350
generations, a thousand
generations?

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:08.038
And hey, what about the problem
that generation time is fast for

00:16:08.038 --> 00:16:10.379
little things and slow for big
things?

00:16:10.379 --> 00:16:13.928
That makes that issue pretty
complicated.

00:16:13.928 --> 00:16:17.193
Then if it is at equilibrium,
the assumption is that every

00:16:17.193 --> 00:16:20.572
time a new species comes in,
one that was already there goes

00:16:20.572 --> 00:16:21.259
extinct.
 

00:16:21.259 --> 00:16:24.720
Well that seems to be a little
unrealistic.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.150
That's a very tight coupling of
immigration and extinction,

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.340
and the real relationship's
weaker.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:34.240
So the major assumption of the
theory,

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.664
which is that there's a
turnover of species that

00:16:36.664 --> 00:16:39.759
produces an equilibrium between
immigration and extinction is

00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:40.379
correct.
 

00:16:40.379 --> 00:16:43.320
That's been tested
experimentally on small islands.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:48.090
But the observed turnover is
often of casual species,

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.450
not the ones that breed with
established populations,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.740
and there's nothing in the
theory to tell us what

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.649
proportion should be in each
category.

00:16:54.649 --> 00:17:00.788
So the theory is a failure;
the theory is a failure if the

00:17:00.788 --> 00:17:02.909
goal is to be right.
 

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:04.798
Okay?
 

00:17:04.798 --> 00:17:08.348
But hey, the goal is not to be
right;

00:17:08.348 --> 00:17:12.288
the goal is to try to explore
Nature in such a way that we

00:17:12.288 --> 00:17:13.740
discover the truth.
 

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.862
And the theory is a great
success if that's what we want

00:17:16.862 --> 00:17:17.430
to know.
 

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.630
We can only operate with a
working hypothesis--

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.858
for a long time this was the
only game in town--

00:17:21.858 --> 00:17:25.701
and the criterion of success is
how much work gets stimulated by

00:17:25.701 --> 00:17:29.090
the idea-- okay?;
you'll see shortly that a lot

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.784
was stimulated by it--and how
rapidly can it be constructively

00:17:33.784 --> 00:17:37.400
falsified and replaced with a
better theory?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.702
The pages of science are
littered with the corpses of

00:17:40.702 --> 00:17:41.720
dead theories.
 

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.916
And sometimes a theory has the
delightful adaptation that it

00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:48.058
contains within itself the seeds
of its own destruction.

00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:51.023
And the seeds of destruction of
a theory are often how

00:17:51.023 --> 00:17:54.548
fascinated people get by it and
how hard they're willing to work

00:17:54.548 --> 00:17:55.779
to try to test it.
 

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:57.880
And that's what happened to
island biogeography;

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.420
it was a good one.
 

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:04.394
So we can look at MacArthur as
a Dionysiac, a creative

00:18:04.394 --> 00:18:05.368
enthusiast.
 

00:18:05.368 --> 00:18:08.506
We can look at Mark Williamson
as an Apollonian objective

00:18:08.506 --> 00:18:09.009
critic.
 

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:11.388
And if you like that dichotomy,
then you ought to go back and

00:18:11.388 --> 00:18:13.690
read Friedrich Nietzsche's
The Birth of Tragedy,

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.545
which he wrote when he was
still a Ph.D.

00:18:16.545 --> 00:18:19.618
student and only
twenty-three-years-old.

00:18:19.618 --> 00:18:24.670
That was long before,
by the way, he went crazy.

00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.538
Okay, so that's one view of the
universe;

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:30.130
that's the island biogeography
view of the universe.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.228
Now I want to do
metapopulations,

00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:36.162
because this is the other major
alternative way of looking at

00:18:36.162 --> 00:18:39.308
spatial dynamics of species and
populations.

00:18:39.308 --> 00:18:46.127
So a metapopulation is a set of
local populations that are

00:18:46.127 --> 00:18:48.640
linked by movement.
 

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.971
And, as with island
biogeography,

00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:55.564
the dynamics of metapopulations
are driven by extinction and re-

00:18:55.564 --> 00:18:57.970
colonization,
or immigration.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.329
So I'm going to be talking a
bit about some of these

00:19:00.329 --> 00:19:01.821
species--
okay?--frogs,

00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:03.940
butterflies,
thyme plants,

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:09.500
pathogen populations living in
us, things like that.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.359
So here's the basic conceptual
framework.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:19.601
Here we have a local population
and it's got reproduction going

00:19:19.601 --> 00:19:20.390
on in it.
 

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.548
It's producing an excess of
organisms,

00:19:22.548 --> 00:19:24.720
and they're moving out into the
environment,

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.992
because it's getting crowded
locally and they want to find a

00:19:26.992 --> 00:19:27.608
place to live.
 

00:19:27.608 --> 00:19:32.538
They go out and they can find
an empty patch to colonize.

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:35.060
And sometimes,
for one reason or another,

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:38.338
their population will go
extinct in a local patch.

00:19:38.338 --> 00:19:41.672
So if you just take a big
sample of patches across the

00:19:41.672 --> 00:19:44.088
landscape,
each of which is a population,

00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:47.289
you will find some of them with
thriving biology going on,

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:51.820
and some of them are empty;
and they can be empty because

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.894
they went extinct or they can be
empty because they were never

00:19:54.894 --> 00:19:55.548
colonized.
 

00:19:55.548 --> 00:19:59.810
And all of them have the
conditions that the organisms

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.500
need to survive in.
 

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.557
So if you build a simple
metapopulation model,

00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:10.426
you can pull out some pretty
important, straightforward

00:20:10.426 --> 00:20:11.599
messages.
 

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:14.358
One of them is this.
 

00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:18.657
Even if every single local
population is likely to go

00:20:18.657 --> 00:20:23.534
extinct, the metapopulation can
survive in a balance between

00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:26.180
extinction and colonization.
 

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.622
So basically you should think
of it as, oh my heavens,

00:20:29.622 --> 00:20:31.960
we're about to go extinct
locally;

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:35.012
I'd better get up and fly out,
and go find a new place,

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:36.368
and just keep hopping.
 

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:41.721
And if a population manages to
do that, it can keep itself

00:20:41.721 --> 00:20:46.414
going, even though it leaves
behind a long trail of

00:20:46.414 --> 00:20:48.950
consistent extinctions.
 

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.579
The landscape is important in
this, and of course that's very

00:20:52.579 --> 00:20:56.150
attractive because it gets
people into landscape ecology;

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:59.920
it gets them into photographs
taken from space;

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.500
it gets them into geographic
information systems.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:08.598
And it's actually created--that
whole area is now a new field of

00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:09.490
analysis.
 

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.108
So the landscape features that
are going to effect extinction

00:21:13.108 --> 00:21:16.547
and colonization then are going
to be things that are very

00:21:16.547 --> 00:21:18.900
important for regional
persistence.

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:21.574
So, you know,
if we're dealing with say

00:21:21.574 --> 00:21:24.528
Daphnia living in ponds in
Connecticut,

00:21:24.528 --> 00:21:28.050
and in any particular pond in
Connecticut Daphnia is likely to

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.153
go extinct,
but we look across the whole

00:21:30.153 --> 00:21:32.368
state and we see that there are
100,000 ponds,

00:21:32.368 --> 00:21:35.767
Daphnia actually ends up
probably doing just fine in

00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:36.700
Connecticut.
 

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:40.981
And if you doubt that,
I suggest you just take a

00:21:40.981 --> 00:21:43.930
beaker of pond water--
not city water,

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:46.108
city water's got a lot of
chlorine in it--

00:21:46.108 --> 00:21:49.367
take a beaker of good natural
pond water and put it on top of

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:52.029
your residential college in
downtown New Haven.

00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:56.009
And go back six months later,
you will find in it rotifers,

00:21:56.009 --> 00:21:59.265
algae and copepods,
and they will have fallen into

00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:02.243
it out of the air,
because these guys fly around

00:22:02.243 --> 00:22:05.115
in the air;
you might not think so but they

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.828
manage to get up there.
 

00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:10.598
Another message is that there
is a ratio between colonization

00:22:10.598 --> 00:22:13.299
and extinction,
above which a metapopulation

00:22:13.299 --> 00:22:14.180
can exist.
 

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.480
So if you're concerned with the
question,

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.644
is there an analytically
determinable threshold for our

00:22:18.644 --> 00:22:22.336
daphnia population in the State
of Connecticut that will tell us

00:22:22.336 --> 00:22:25.675
how much they have to move
around in order to stay here in

00:22:25.675 --> 00:22:26.788
the long run?
 

00:22:26.788 --> 00:22:28.585
The model will give us that.
 

00:22:28.585 --> 00:22:28.970
Okay?
 

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:31.675
That's the threshold ratio
between colonization and

00:22:31.675 --> 00:22:32.380
extinction.
 

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.650
And it's kind of a simple
number.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.029
It tells us those are the rates
we have to worry about.

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:41.298
And you can interpret that in
terms of the proportion of

00:22:41.298 --> 00:22:44.328
patches that are occupied and
average patch size.

00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:47.015
So there's actually something
you can go out and measure that

00:22:47.015 --> 00:22:48.940
will give you an estimate of
this ratio,

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.598
which will tell you will the
thing persist or not?

00:22:51.598 --> 00:22:55.430
So if you're concerned with
population viability analysis,

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.279
if you're concerned with
conservation and with the

00:22:58.279 --> 00:23:01.404
threats to biodiversity,
this is something that you can

00:23:01.404 --> 00:23:04.750
actually go out to measure,
and then construct an argument

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.153
with;
and you can back your argument

00:23:07.153 --> 00:23:11.288
up with a literature that has
now some rather impressive logic

00:23:11.288 --> 00:23:11.900
in it.
 

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.000
So here are a few insights.
 

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.828
It's perfectly normal to have
some local empty patches.

00:23:19.828 --> 00:23:22.979
You know, in my village in
Switzerland they were very

00:23:22.979 --> 00:23:26.551
worried about their carabid
beetles, because that's all they

00:23:26.551 --> 00:23:28.631
have left;
and they had some carabid

00:23:28.631 --> 00:23:31.536
beetles, they had a few toads
and they had some salamanders,

00:23:31.536 --> 00:23:33.950
and there wasn't very much left
in the forest.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.563
And locally people would get
very desperate about their local

00:23:37.563 --> 00:23:41.297
pond not having any salamanders
in it anymore or something like

00:23:41.297 --> 00:23:43.601
that,
whereas if they would back up

00:23:43.601 --> 00:23:47.063
and they would look at say a
chunk of landscape that was 100

00:23:47.063 --> 00:23:49.577
kilometers on a side,
they could relax,

00:23:49.577 --> 00:23:53.153
because local things are often
going extinct but then being

00:23:53.153 --> 00:23:54.140
re-colonized.
 

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.750
And you actually need to be
able to back up and look at it,

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.878
at a fairly large spatial
scale, and a pretty long

00:23:59.878 --> 00:24:02.333
timescale,
before you can discern the

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:03.269
overall trend.
 

00:24:03.269 --> 00:24:06.125
This places a big demand on
data collection,

00:24:06.125 --> 00:24:09.910
but it leads to a lot more
realism in making forecasts.

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.922
So you need to look at the
region and the landscape,

00:24:12.922 --> 00:24:14.990
rather than the local
population.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.412
But there is something that's
hard to measure and that's the

00:24:17.412 --> 00:24:18.109
migration rate.
 

00:24:18.109 --> 00:24:18.740
Okay?
 

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.259
It's just hard to see.
 

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:22.915
After all, if I were a
salamander, I would do it on a

00:24:22.915 --> 00:24:25.930
rainy night--right?--at about
two o'clock in the morning;

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.779
and who's going to be out there
tracking me around?

00:24:27.779 --> 00:24:32.420
So this is hard to measure.
 

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:36.650
Is there evidence that in fact
Nature is organized this way?

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.742
Well we know that population
size is significantly affected

00:24:40.742 --> 00:24:43.847
by migration,
and we can see that in both the

00:24:43.847 --> 00:24:46.529
source effect and the sink
effect.

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:49.769
So you put a fence around a
population, and if it's a source

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:52.131
it will increase,
and if it's a sink it will

00:24:52.131 --> 00:24:52.900
disappear.
 

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:57.827
And that can only happen if the
source would normally be

00:24:57.827 --> 00:25:01.266
exporting migrants,
immigrants that are going out,

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:04.240
and the sink would only happen,
it would only disappear,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:06.170
when the fence is put around
it,

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.190
if it had been previously
maintained by stuff coming in

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.028
from sources.
 

00:25:10.028 --> 00:25:13.519
So that's experimentally
demonstrable.

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:18.022
We know that population density
is affected by the area and the

00:25:18.022 --> 00:25:19.838
isolation of the patch.
 

00:25:19.838 --> 00:25:23.561
Big patches tend to have
slightly higher densities,

00:25:23.561 --> 00:25:27.358
and distant patches tend to
have lower densities.

00:25:27.358 --> 00:25:29.996
If it's really a
metapopulation,

00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:34.333
then population density should
be going up and down,

00:25:34.333 --> 00:25:36.119
out of synchrony.
 

00:25:36.119 --> 00:25:37.220
Okay?
 

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.496
If it's really tightly linked,
and there's a tremendous amount

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:41.138
of immigration,
then you could just treat the

00:25:41.138 --> 00:25:42.519
thing as just one big
population.

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.470
But if it's a metapopulation,
and some things are doing okay

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.318
and some things are going
extinct,

00:25:47.318 --> 00:25:50.760
then doing okay means going up,
and going extinct means going

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.299
down,
at the same time.

00:25:52.299 --> 00:25:56.579
So they would be asynchronous;
and that is often observed.

00:25:56.579 --> 00:25:58.808
Is there a population turnover?
 

00:25:58.808 --> 00:26:03.087
Do local populations go extinct
and then get re-colonized from a

00:26:03.087 --> 00:26:03.700
source?
 

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.016
And that's been observed,
at least in one case,

00:26:06.016 --> 00:26:08.028
for snails living in ponds in
the U.K.

00:26:08.028 --> 00:26:11.127
And that's done by taking
samples of the mud in the bottom

00:26:11.127 --> 00:26:14.499
of the ponds and going back over
many years and looking for the

00:26:14.499 --> 00:26:15.750
presence of snails.
 

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.728
And they disappear and they
come back, and they disappear

00:26:17.728 --> 00:26:18.470
and they come back.
 

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:27.964
If you're a good naturalist and
you know where your beast likes

00:26:27.964 --> 00:26:33.394
to live, then one often sees
that suitable habitat is

00:26:33.394 --> 00:26:36.318
present, but it's empty.
 

00:26:36.318 --> 00:26:39.756
And both in a plant population
and in a butterfly

00:26:39.756 --> 00:26:42.905
metapopulation,
both of these metapopulations

00:26:42.905 --> 00:26:46.200
persist, despite lots of local
extinction.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.512
So the butterfly population is
in Finland, and the plant

00:26:49.512 --> 00:26:53.019
population is in Provence;
its thyme in Provence.

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:56.084
And both of these--by the way,
if you like metapopulation

00:26:56.084 --> 00:26:58.766
biology, you get to do lots of
neat field biology,

00:26:58.766 --> 00:27:01.009
and do it in wonderful
circumstances.

00:27:01.009 --> 00:27:04.768
And since the French use the
thyme in their cooking,

00:27:04.768 --> 00:27:08.305
and the butterflies are
beautiful, this is a nice

00:27:08.305 --> 00:27:10.588
sensory experience as well.
 

00:27:10.588 --> 00:27:15.434
The risk of extinction in a
metapopulation does depend on

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:16.558
patch size.
 

00:27:16.558 --> 00:27:18.821
If you're in a small one,
it's much more likely that

00:27:18.821 --> 00:27:21.130
you'll go extinct than if you're
in a large patch.

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:23.558
So the evidence for that is
pretty strong.

00:27:23.558 --> 00:27:27.400
And the colonization rate
depends on patch isolation;

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.150
and that's true for most
species.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:33.491
I would like to note here that
if you take the Max

00:27:33.491 --> 00:27:38.896
Planck-Gesselschaft A330 up for
a little tour around the globe

00:27:38.896 --> 00:27:42.373
at 35,000 feet,
and you put out a--you slow the

00:27:42.373 --> 00:27:45.338
plane down enough so you can put
out a plankton net,

00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:48.858
and you troll for aerial
plankton up in the stratosphere,

00:27:48.858 --> 00:27:53.380
you will find baby spiders and
fern spores covering the planet,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.848
up in the stratosphere.
 

00:27:54.848 --> 00:27:57.720
You can do that over the South
Pole,

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.938
at 35,000 feet,
and you will find,

00:27:59.938 --> 00:28:02.203
in a state,
believe me, of deep

00:28:02.203 --> 00:28:06.175
hibernation, little tiny baby
spiders rafting along at -70

00:28:06.175 --> 00:28:09.808
degrees Celsius,
and they're still alive.

00:28:09.808 --> 00:28:11.980
Fern spores will do the same
thing.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:15.630
So, in fact,
these are exceptions.

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:19.074
The colonization rate,
depending on patch isolation,

00:28:19.074 --> 00:28:22.181
however, would be very
important for elephants,

00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.950
rhinoceroses,
bears, stuff like that.

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:26.190
Okay?
 

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.317
So you can see that there's a
gradation based on dispersal

00:28:29.317 --> 00:28:32.328
ability, body size;
lots of biology.

00:28:32.328 --> 00:28:35.490
Small isolated patches are
likely to be empty.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.900
Big connected patches are
likely to be full.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.666
Lots of evidence for that;
that's certainly a

00:28:40.666 --> 00:28:43.259
straightforward prediction of
the model.

00:28:43.259 --> 00:28:46.910
And a fugitive competitor can
exist in a metapopulation.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.541
A fugitive competitor is one
that if you just put them into a

00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:54.743
local equilibrium population,
they will get beaten out by the

00:28:54.743 --> 00:28:56.788
other species that's there.
 

00:28:56.788 --> 00:28:59.259
But if they are better at
dispersing, while the other one

00:28:59.259 --> 00:29:01.553
is better at competing,
they can keep jumping out and

00:29:01.553 --> 00:29:02.700
getting ahead of that.
 

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:06.332
And that's been well
investigated with Daphnia in the

00:29:06.332 --> 00:29:07.798
Finish Archipelago.
 

00:29:07.798 --> 00:29:10.579
Furthermore,
I'm going to show you a shot of

00:29:10.579 --> 00:29:14.588
a prey species that would go
extinct in a local population,

00:29:14.588 --> 00:29:18.368
but it can co-exist with its
predator in a metapopulation;

00:29:18.368 --> 00:29:21.509
and I'll show that for two
mites living in greenhouses.

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:27.123
Now, the point that is made
here is that when you shift from

00:29:27.123 --> 00:29:31.690
the equilibrium local population
perspective,

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.720
up to the metapopulation
perspective,

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.656
the complexities of spatial
distribution will allow a lot

00:29:37.656 --> 00:29:40.608
more things to co-exist with
each other.

00:29:40.608 --> 00:29:43.778
And that's true both for
competition theory and it's true

00:29:43.778 --> 00:29:45.078
for predation theory.
 

00:29:45.078 --> 00:29:48.960
So here's the Finnish
Archipelago.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.798
It is, by the way,
continuing to emerge from the

00:29:53.798 --> 00:29:58.019
water, because there's glacial
rebound.

00:29:58.019 --> 00:29:59.940
After the Pleistocene,
glaciers melted.

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.977
They had depressed the
underlying continental crust,

00:30:02.977 --> 00:30:05.420
and it is now rebounding and
rising up.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.880
So these islands continue to
come out of the water.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.244
And they are a lovely kind of
fairytale kind of landscape,

00:30:11.244 --> 00:30:14.019
filled with all sorts of
interesting biology.

00:30:14.019 --> 00:30:16.087
They have on them,
for example,

00:30:16.087 --> 00:30:19.740
six-foot long water snakes,
that are about that thick,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:23.118
and they have lots of birds and
other things.

00:30:23.118 --> 00:30:25.825
And on them they have little
pools of fresh water,

00:30:25.825 --> 00:30:28.971
surrounded by this part of the
Baltic, which is not really

00:30:28.971 --> 00:30:30.960
seawater, it's kind of brackish.
 

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:34.630
But the Daphnia can't really
survive in the sea;

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:38.618
the salinity is still too high
for them.

00:30:38.618 --> 00:30:42.015
So they move around among
pools, on these islands,

00:30:42.015 --> 00:30:44.817
in places like this;
this little island here might

00:30:44.817 --> 00:30:46.230
have ten or twenty pools on it.
 

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:48.588
And they are moving around,
among these islands,

00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:54.068
probably having their ephippia,
which are their resting stages,

00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:57.910
borne on the feet of shorebirds
that are flying.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.858
And there are at least two
species of Daphnia that live in

00:31:02.858 --> 00:31:05.028
the Finish Archipelago.
 

00:31:05.028 --> 00:31:06.680
One of them is a better
competitor,

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.626
one of them is a better
disperser, and they co-exist

00:31:09.626 --> 00:31:12.460
because what one lacks in
competition ability,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.650
it makes up in dispersal
ability.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.421
So if you have that kind of a
tradeoff, you can generate a

00:31:18.421 --> 00:31:21.730
persistent metapopulation in a
system like that.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:24.273
I strongly recommend,
by the way, if you're ever in

00:31:24.273 --> 00:31:27.124
Stockholm or in Helsinki,
that you go out into the Baltic

00:31:27.124 --> 00:31:29.743
Archipelagos;
they are just beautiful

00:31:29.743 --> 00:31:30.660
landscapes.
 

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.858
The other is mites in a
greenhouse.

00:31:34.858 --> 00:31:38.500
And this is Carl Huffaker's
experiment,

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:42.671
and he had a brilliant idea for
a model system in which you

00:31:42.671 --> 00:31:46.339
could investigate the impact of
spatial structure on

00:31:46.339 --> 00:31:48.568
predator/prey interactions.
 

00:31:48.568 --> 00:31:54.059
He had a herbivorous mite that
likes to eat oranges;

00:31:54.059 --> 00:31:57.400
and these are oranges, okay?
 

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.528
And he had a predatory mite
that eats the herbivorous mite.

00:32:02.528 --> 00:32:06.413
And what he did was he
constructed a model ecosystem

00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:10.982
that consisted of a whole bunch
of oranges, interspersed with

00:32:10.982 --> 00:32:14.222
billiard balls;
well obviously the herbivorous

00:32:14.222 --> 00:32:17.690
mite can't eat a billiard ball,
but it can eat an orange.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:22.491
And then he altered the
migration rates of the species

00:32:22.491 --> 00:32:26.568
by putting grease down,
in between the two.

00:32:26.568 --> 00:32:29.233
So he had a system that you
could actually put in your

00:32:29.233 --> 00:32:31.852
kitchen cabinet,
that had a complete spatial

00:32:31.852 --> 00:32:35.170
ecosystem in it,
and he could play with the

00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:36.190
parameters.
 

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.262
And what Huffaker discovered is
that he could have persistence

00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:44.135
of a predator and prey with
spatial structure where if they

00:32:44.135 --> 00:32:48.410
were confined to a single orange
they would both go extinct;

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:52.056
first the prey would go extinct
and then the predator would

00:32:52.056 --> 00:32:52.558
start.
 

00:32:52.558 --> 00:32:56.070
Okay, so back to a comparison
between the two ways of looking

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.950
at the world.
 

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:01.009
If you look at the number of
publications per year,

00:33:01.009 --> 00:33:04.381
using say Web of Science,
you can see that interest in

00:33:04.381 --> 00:33:07.752
island biogeography peaked in
the mid-80s and then has

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:09.813
declined;
it's not gone to zero,

00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:10.990
but it's going down.
 

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:14.076
But since 1985,
there's been an explosion of

00:33:14.076 --> 00:33:16.230
interest in metapopulations.
 

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:20.710
And there are really two
reasons for that.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:24.714
One of them is that it is
obvious that the landscape

00:33:24.714 --> 00:33:29.109
really is fragmented,
and so metapopulation theory

00:33:29.109 --> 00:33:34.400
has become an organizing concept
in conservation biology,

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.066
where people try to maintain
biodiversity at a landscape

00:33:38.066 --> 00:33:38.599
scale.
 

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:42.848
We can see it all around us.
 

00:33:42.848 --> 00:33:47.000
It's much easier to study and
manipulate a metapopulation than

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.519
it is to manipulate an
archipelago.

00:33:49.519 --> 00:33:52.096
So there's been a lot more
progress doing experiments,

00:33:52.096 --> 00:33:54.868
like the ones that I showed you
that Carl Huffaker did.

00:33:54.868 --> 00:33:57.029
That was actually before the
theory came up;

00:33:57.029 --> 00:34:00.440
he was sort of a prophet way
ahead of his time.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.156
And there's an analogy to
epidemiology,

00:34:03.156 --> 00:34:06.843
and it's quite compelling;
and we know that epidemiology

00:34:06.843 --> 00:34:07.250
works.
 

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.559
So I now want to show you the
analogy with epidemiology.

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:18.126
And this is a connection now
between ecology and infectious

00:34:18.126 --> 00:34:19.260
disease.
 

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.219
So the host is a local patch.
 

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:26.226
Here's a local patch;
that looks like a good one to

00:34:26.226 --> 00:34:26.710
infect.
 

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:27.949
Here's another one.
 

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.159
Boy am I going to get her in
the dorm.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.159
You know?
 

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.909
Pathogens have local
populations within hosts.

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:38.039
Now what would constitute
extinction?

00:34:38.039 --> 00:34:40.864
Well extinction would be either
you kill your host,

00:34:40.864 --> 00:34:43.635
so you die with it,
or the host develops an immune

00:34:43.635 --> 00:34:44.369
response.
 

00:34:44.369 --> 00:34:44.840
Okay?
 

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.500
So you get--you can go extinct
for either reason;

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:50.277
and by the way,
if you're a pathogen,

00:34:50.277 --> 00:34:52.130
either is equally bad.
 

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:57.331
The disease transmission rate
is equivalent to the migration

00:34:57.331 --> 00:34:57.949
rate.
 

00:34:57.949 --> 00:35:01.193
And if we look at that--I'm now
going to go back and I'm going

00:35:01.193 --> 00:35:04.224
to re-rehearse this issue of
measles on islands and in big

00:35:04.224 --> 00:35:04.809
cities.
 

00:35:04.809 --> 00:35:09.041
It was mentioned last Friday,
briefly, but it's an important

00:35:09.041 --> 00:35:13.130
example, and I feel entirely
unashamed about mentioning an

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:17.210
important example twice;
there might even be a better

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:21.650
chance of it being remembered a
week or twenty years later.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.010
So measles in big cities are a
huge metapopulation with a

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:30.371
continual input of young hosts
that don't have any immune

00:35:30.371 --> 00:35:31.929
defense: babies.
 

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:34.480
Okay?
 

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:40.518
Luscious little susceptible
babies, ripe for infection.

00:35:40.518 --> 00:35:44.960
On islands--an island is a tiny
little metapopulation.

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:48.224
You know, look at the Falkland
Islands or the Orkneys or

00:35:48.224 --> 00:35:51.949
something like that;
Pitcairn Island, Easter Island.

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.039
Very few hosts.
 

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:57.670
And if measles could get onto
an island like that,

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.105
or any other infectious disease
that causes a sterilizing immune

00:36:02.105 --> 00:36:04.126
response,
as measles does,

00:36:04.126 --> 00:36:07.730
then it'll sweep in a wave
through that island,

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:11.393
and everybody will become
immune before enough babies can

00:36:11.393 --> 00:36:13.619
be born to maintain the disease.
 

00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:17.510
So repeated extinction occurs.
 

00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:22.789
Here is the incidence of
measles in big cities and on

00:36:22.789 --> 00:36:27.588
islands between 1921 and 1940--
so this is before measles

00:36:27.588 --> 00:36:30.949
vaccine, when you could study
this as a natural process--

00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:35.639
and zero years with a month of
no cases in the big cities.

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:38.050
And as we go from fairly large
islands,

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.869
down to smaller islands,
we have more and more months

00:36:41.869 --> 00:36:44.369
with no cases,
until you get to the Falkland

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:46.230
Islands,
and over that nineteen year

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.356
period there wasn't a single
case of measles in the Falkland

00:36:49.356 --> 00:36:49.940
Islands.
 

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.521
They must've been pretty
worried about a ship coming in

00:36:52.521 --> 00:36:55.297
that had somebody with measles
on it, but there was no case

00:36:55.297 --> 00:36:56.780
during that nineteen years.
 

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.239
So here's a guy with measles.
 

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:02.210
Here's the pathogen.
 

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:07.858
This is the situation in a big
city, and here is the Falkland

00:37:07.858 --> 00:37:08.800
Islands.
 

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.518
As you can see,
the density that you have in a

00:37:11.518 --> 00:37:14.237
big city just makes for
wonderful transmission

00:37:14.237 --> 00:37:15.989
possibilities;
fantastic.

00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:20.259
So diseases will tend to go
extinct on little islands,

00:37:20.259 --> 00:37:24.931
and host populations will then
lose both their acquired and

00:37:24.931 --> 00:37:27.429
their inherited resistance.
 

00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:32.384
And if then after many years
the disease is reintroduced,

00:37:32.384 --> 00:37:36.099
the epidemic can really be
catastrophic.

00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:39.550
So I think you already know
that on Hispaniola,

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:42.360
between--that's the Dominican
Republic and Haiti--

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.543
between 1492 and the
late-1500s, a population of

00:37:46.543 --> 00:37:52.239
about half a million indigenous
Americans was reduced to 300,

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:54.730
by measles and by other
diseases.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:59.764
Also when the Conquistadores
landed at Veracruz and started

00:37:59.764 --> 00:38:04.538
marching on Mexico City,
the wave, the epidemic preceded

00:38:04.538 --> 00:38:06.748
them;
so the Aztec army was being

00:38:06.748 --> 00:38:08.969
decimated by disease when they
got there.

00:38:08.969 --> 00:38:11.021
But, you know,
the Aztecs really weren't--it's

00:38:11.021 --> 00:38:13.940
not the only explanation--the
Aztecs were not very well liked;

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.271
this habit of ripping people's
hearts out and eating them on

00:38:17.271 --> 00:38:20.489
altars hadn't endeared them to
the captives that they got,

00:38:20.489 --> 00:38:22.070
and the subject peoples.
 

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:26.179
And so actually it only took
900 Conquistadores to defeat the

00:38:26.179 --> 00:38:29.907
Aztec army,
because they had 200,000 local

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:32.989
allies that said,
"Yeah, we want to beat 'em

00:38:32.989 --> 00:38:33.590
up too."
 

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:37.623
So it was both that effect,
and the disease effect,

00:38:37.623 --> 00:38:40.690
that allowed the conquest of
Mexico.

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:44.730
In a city what's going on is
that the pathogen population is

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.360
being rescued by the
colonization of empty habitat.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.717
So this is the rescue effect in
a metapopulation and it's the

00:38:51.717 --> 00:38:53.510
rescue effect in epidemiology.
 

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.657
And that--basically the
pathogens are being rescued by

00:38:57.657 --> 00:39:01.260
babies, and the babies are born
susceptible;

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.219
they do not yet have an
acquired immune reaction,

00:39:04.219 --> 00:39:07.550
they haven't built up the
population of cells that will

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.768
target that particular pathogen.
 

00:39:09.768 --> 00:39:13.840
And so that rescues the disease
before it goes extinct.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:19.289
And there are enough of these
babies coming in,

00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:24.139
in a city, so that the
colonization rate,

00:39:24.139 --> 00:39:29.148
the transmission rate,
and the number of occupiable

00:39:29.148 --> 00:39:32.192
sites,
is high enough to keep that

00:39:32.192 --> 00:39:33.619
population going.
 

00:39:33.619 --> 00:39:37.768
So the take-home point on this
lecture,

00:39:37.768 --> 00:39:41.260
besides the fact that the
professor is crazy and wearing a

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.478
mask,
is that geography is very

00:39:44.478 --> 00:39:48.679
important in ecology,
and there have been a number of

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:51.952
pretty big attempts to create
analytical systems to deal with

00:39:51.952 --> 00:39:52.280
it.
 

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:56.909
A lot of the world is
fragmented.

00:39:56.909 --> 00:40:00.442
I think even the Abyssal Plain
is getting fragmented as

00:40:00.442 --> 00:40:03.190
trawlers start going deeper and
deeper,

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:06.010
and if we undertake mining
operations in the North Pacific,

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:09.719
to pick up little modules of
molybdenum and things like that,

00:40:09.719 --> 00:40:15.909
we're going to just continue to
disrupt the entire planet.

00:40:15.909 --> 00:40:19.047
Movement by organisms,
among fragments,

00:40:19.047 --> 00:40:22.929
creates a dynamic across the
whole landscape.

00:40:22.929 --> 00:40:26.693
And local extinctions and
re-colonizations may be an

00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:29.815
entirely normal thing,
and you can't really see that

00:40:29.815 --> 00:40:31.929
until you look at a big enough
chunk of space,

00:40:31.929 --> 00:40:35.000
in a long enough period of
time, to establish a

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.670
metapopulation dynamic.
 

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.378
And then finally I'd like to
emphasize that the spread of

00:40:39.378 --> 00:40:40.873
disease,
epidemiology,

00:40:40.873 --> 00:40:44.139
can be viewed as a
metapopulation dynamic,

00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:47.052
and can be viewed as a model
system within which to test

00:40:47.052 --> 00:40:48.590
metapopulation assumptions.
 

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.329
And when you do that,
it seems to work pretty well.

00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:55.215
Okay, so next time I'm going to
talk about the flow of energy

00:40:55.215 --> 00:40:57.289
and matter through ecosystems.
 

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:00.829
And if I can get my costume
off, I am available to go to

00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:01.730
lunch today.

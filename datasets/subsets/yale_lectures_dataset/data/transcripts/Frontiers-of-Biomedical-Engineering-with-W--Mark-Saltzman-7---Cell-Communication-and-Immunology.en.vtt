00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.620
Professor Mark Saltzman:
Good morning.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.370
So, this is kind of a
transition week.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.210
We've been talking about more
basic, more biological subjects.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.579
Starting this week we're going
to sort of mix physiology and

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.504
Biomedical Engineering,
and that's going to start sort

00:00:30.504 --> 00:00:34.795
of this week and next.
The topic for this week is self

00:00:34.795 --> 00:00:37.772
communication:
how mechanisms that cells

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:42.503
within a complex organism use to
communicate with each other at

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:45.480
short distances or long
distances.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.945
Then we're going to talk about
two physiological systems just

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:53.667
briefly, where cell
communication sort of dominates

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:58.552
the behavior of the organ.
That's in the immune system and

00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:02.916
in the nervous system.
This will lead us into a

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:07.110
discussion of sort of
bioengineering of the immune

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.390
system, in particular,
and we're going to talk next

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.681
week about vaccines.
This will be the first real

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:20.302
example where we've talked about
the physiology of an organ

00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:25.003
system together with engineering
approaches to modulate that

00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:27.579
organ,
and that will continue

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.589
throughout the semester.
You'll notice that the chapters

00:01:31.589 --> 00:01:35.011
because of this go out of
sequence, so we're reading

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:38.499
Chapter 6 this week and next
week we'll read parts of

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:41.540
Chapters 14 and 15,
that's because the book has a

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.639
different kind of organization.
It talks about the basics,

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.504
then it talks about physiology
in the second part,

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:50.134
and then it talks about
Biomedical Engineering

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:52.353
separately.
But we're going to in class

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:55.300
treat the physiology and the
Biomedical Engineering together.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.060
Any questions about that,
or that makes some sense?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.525
Cell communication and
immunology is what we're going

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.711
to - is the topic for this week.
I don't need to say too much

00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:14.395
probably about why cells need to
communicate with each other but

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:18.800
this is a schematic version.
One way to draw sort of a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.085
schematic diagram of the
operation of the human body

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:28.125
where it shows separated organ
systems and tries to show them

00:02:28.125 --> 00:02:30.895
in context.
The respiratory system,

00:02:30.895 --> 00:02:32.692
for example,
the renal system,

00:02:32.692 --> 00:02:36.422
the digestive system,
these are examples - three

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:40.736
examples of organ systems that
contact the external

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:43.582
environment.
We've talked about the

00:02:43.582 --> 00:02:47.606
interesting way in which the
digestive system contacts the

00:02:47.606 --> 00:02:51.092
external environment.
Depending on what you call

00:02:51.092 --> 00:02:54.677
external and internal
environment, this path that I'm

00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:57.539
tracing here,
deep within your digestive

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:01.328
system, is really directly
connected to the outside world

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:05.143
through both ends.
Of course when molecules

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:09.587
get absorbed through the
intestinal tract they become

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:12.750
part of your internal
environment.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.225
We've talked about one the main
concepts in physiology being

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:21.776
homeostasis, that is 'how do you
maintain a constant internal

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:24.587
environment?
We need to have conditions

00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:27.658
internally that are relatively
constant in terms of

00:03:27.658 --> 00:03:30.315
temperature,
and pH, and chemical

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:33.699
composition in order for us to
thrive.

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:38.463
In order for life to proceed,
you need to maintain a constant

00:03:38.463 --> 00:03:41.760
internal environment.
That's achieved - in fact

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.760
that's the main goal of many of
these organ systems,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.794
right?
The main goal of the

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:50.681
respiratory system is to bring
fresh in so that you can extract

00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:54.106
oxygen from it,
and blow used air out so that

00:03:54.106 --> 00:03:58.541
you can rid of carbon dioxide
which is the end product of

00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:01.629
carbon metabolism inside our
bodies.

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.165
The respiratory system plays an
important role in maintaining

00:04:06.165 --> 00:04:10.248
our internal environment at the
proper level of oxygen,

00:04:10.248 --> 00:04:12.969
by bringing the right amount
in.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.810
You regulate your breathing
rate in order to accomplish that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.000
and we'll talk about this in a
couple of weeks.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.825
The renal system has an
equally important function in

00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:30.610
that way, in maintaining your
water balance.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.487
The amount of water that you
need to have the optimal sort of

00:04:34.487 --> 00:04:38.042
concentrations of things is
determined by how much urine

00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:41.920
your kidneys produce and how
much they excrete each day.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.745
In addition,
the kidney controls the

00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:48.540
composition of your body of many
important ions,

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.658
sodium bicarbonate which is
important in pH balance,

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:55.715
potassium.
By determining how many of

00:04:55.715 --> 00:04:59.790
those molecules to hold onto,
how many to keep in the body,

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.734
how many to release determines
the internal composition with

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:09.083
regard to that ion.
The digestive system,

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:11.748
of course, is responsible for
bringing in sort of fresh

00:05:11.748 --> 00:05:14.196
nutrients,
fresh substrates for cellular

00:05:14.196 --> 00:05:18.060
metabolism, fresh quantities of
amino acids, and nucleotides,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.120
and the things that we can't
generate internally.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.604
So, these are all involved with
our ability to maintain

00:05:26.604 --> 00:05:31.885
homeostasis by exchanging
materials with the external

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:34.616
environment.
There are some organ

00:05:34.616 --> 00:05:36.230
systems that are totally
internal.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.974
The circulatory system which
we'll talk about in a couple of

00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:42.487
weeks, the heart,
the blood vessels,

00:05:42.487 --> 00:05:46.338
and the blood work together to
form a totally internal

00:05:46.338 --> 00:05:49.286
function.
There's no point where the

00:05:49.286 --> 00:05:53.997
circulatory system crosses the
boundary between being inside

00:05:53.997 --> 00:05:57.910
you and outside of you,
it's totally internal.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.408
Its role is to move molecules
around in the body so that

00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:04.779
they're available to cells
everywhere within your body

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.960
regardless of how close they are
to your skin,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.956
and we'll talk about that.
The nervous system,

00:06:10.956 --> 00:06:14.521
the endocrine system which
we'll start talking about a

00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.556
little bit today is the system
that's responsible for sending

00:06:18.556 --> 00:06:22.389
signals back and forth between
tissues of your body.

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.550
The nervous system does the
same thing in a different way.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.067
These two systems which are
shown in the core of this

00:06:33.067 --> 00:06:40.463
diagram really are responsible
for regulating and exchanging

00:06:40.463 --> 00:06:46.480
information between the other
organ systems.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.860
How do your lungs know what
your heart is doing?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.061
How do your kidneys know what
the status is of inside your

00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:57.139
blood, for example?
They know that because they

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:00.313
receive signals from the
endocrine system and the nervous

00:07:00.313 --> 00:07:02.141
system.
These are primarily

00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:05.858
communication systems which act
to allow your other organ

00:07:05.858 --> 00:07:09.760
systems to work in concert.
We're going to talk about

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.660
the mechanisms by which these
work as well.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.626
Now there's something very
wrong about this diagram,

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:18.999
in that it's showing these
functions as sort of centralized

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:21.297
in the core,
and of course that's not how

00:07:21.297 --> 00:07:24.362
your body is organized.
It's not that all these layers

00:07:24.362 --> 00:07:28.399
are wrapped around the nervous
system and the endocrine system.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:32.190
These systems are dispersed
throughout your body and their

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.781
dispersal is important,
and so we'll talk about that as

00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:36.380
well.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:45.752
Take a step way back and
think about what's the basic

00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:49.079
mechanism by which cells receive
signals.

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:53.395
It turns out that cells receive
signals or information from the

00:07:53.395 --> 00:07:56.180
rest of the body in a variety of
ways,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.571
but there's one way in
particular that's a very useful

00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:03.410
way for thinking about how cells
receive most information.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.250
It's shown schematically on
this diagram here.

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.709
On the side over here shows a
cell membrane and so this is

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:15.033
outside the cell above it,
and this is inside the cell

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:19.300
below, and this is the lipid
bilayer that separates the

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.329
outside of the cell from the
inside of the cell.

00:08:23.329 --> 00:08:26.630
I've already mentioned many
times that the lipid bilayer,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.459
the cell membrane,
isn't just a lipid bilayer.

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:34.110
That there are other molecules
in the lipid bilayer and they're

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.534
important for cells getting
information or getting molecules

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:41.597
from outside.
We've talked about one

00:08:41.597 --> 00:08:44.965
class of molecules,
they're transporters that move

00:08:44.965 --> 00:08:47.440
molecules from inside to
outside,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.784
or outside to in,
that wouldn't ordinarily be

00:08:49.784 --> 00:08:51.809
transported through a cell
membrane.

00:08:51.809 --> 00:08:55.353
Glucose is a great example of
that and we're going to come

00:08:55.353 --> 00:08:58.399
back to that a little bit later
in the lecture.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:02.059
If a cell membrane was indeed
just a lipid bilayer,

00:09:02.059 --> 00:09:06.085
then glucose could never enter
the cell because it can't

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:11.364
permeate through cell membranes.
Glucose has to get into cells,

00:09:11.364 --> 00:09:16.125
that's the main source of
energy source that cells use,

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:20.101
metabolism of glucose.
It does so because there are

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:24.087
some molecules in the surface of
the membrane that allow glucose

00:09:24.087 --> 00:09:26.642
to move in and out.
Those are called glucose

00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:29.205
transporters.
There's another whole

00:09:29.205 --> 00:09:32.600
family of molecules that sit in
the surface.

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.963
They're not responsible
necessarily for moving molecules

00:09:35.963 --> 00:09:38.715
inside and out,
but they sit at the outside of

00:09:38.715 --> 00:09:41.100
the cell and they wait for
signals.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.034
When they receive the signal
they make - they change in a

00:09:45.034 --> 00:09:49.391
very specific way and the cell
can recognize this change that's

00:09:49.391 --> 00:09:54.087
occurred at the cell surface.
That general class of molecules

00:09:54.087 --> 00:09:58.382
is called receptors and its
shown here just as a block of

00:09:58.382 --> 00:10:01.450
material living in the cell
membrane.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:05.151
We're going to talk about
different classes of receptors

00:10:05.151 --> 00:10:08.582
in just a minute.
For now, just picture it in

00:10:08.582 --> 00:10:12.570
this simple way as a molecule,
usually a protein,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:17.729
that's embedded in the cell
membrane and many receptors have

00:10:17.729 --> 00:10:21.139
a part of them that is
extracellular.

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:25.248
They go across the membrane -
this is the trans-membrane part

00:10:25.248 --> 00:10:28.740
of the receptor that's going
across the membrane.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:33.044
Then there's a part that's
inside the cell sticking down

00:10:33.044 --> 00:10:36.857
into the cell cytoplasm.
So, this is called the

00:10:36.857 --> 00:10:41.464
extracellular region or domain,
this is the trans-membrane

00:10:41.464 --> 00:10:45.020
region or domain,
and this is the cytoplasmic

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.086
region.
Because these molecules can

00:10:48.086 --> 00:10:51.399
span across the membrane from
outside to inside,

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:54.616
they're in just the right
position to take messages that

00:10:54.616 --> 00:10:58.067
they receive from outside the
cell and transmit them through

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:01.050
the membrane into the cells
internal apparatus,

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.978
and that's what they do.
The signal comes in the form of

00:11:04.978 --> 00:11:09.394
molecules which we're going to
call throughout the lecture here

00:11:09.394 --> 00:11:12.722
'ligands'.
This terminology 'ligand' and

00:11:12.722 --> 00:11:16.120
'receptor' you've probably heard
before.

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.284
It refers to usually
'receptors' that are fixed in a

00:11:20.284 --> 00:11:23.932
cell, on a cell membrane,
and 'ligands' which are

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:27.570
dispersed throughout the body
and free to diffuse around,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.399
and occasionally will find the
cell.

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:34.225
When they do find the cell
they're capable of interacting

00:11:34.225 --> 00:11:38.187
with the receptor forming some
kind of chemical interaction

00:11:38.187 --> 00:11:40.985
with the receptor.
Now, usually this is a

00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:44.066
non-covalent interaction.
There's not actually chemical

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:47.332
covalent bonds that are formed
but it's a non-covalent

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:50.659
interaction, usually dominated
by hydrogen bonding.

00:11:50.659 --> 00:11:54.964
We're going to talk about this
kind of non-covalent interaction

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.019
more when we talk about the
immune system,

00:11:58.019 --> 00:12:01.667
because one example of ligand
and receptors that's important

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:05.129
in the immune system are
antigens - foreign molecules,

00:12:05.129 --> 00:12:09.210
and antibodies - molecules that
we produce.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:12.309
Today let's think about it
more generally as ligands and

00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:15.354
receptors.
The ligands are bringing some

00:12:15.354 --> 00:12:19.600
message, they transmit the
message by binding to the

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.724
receptor.
When they bind,

00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:25.996
they produce some change in the
receptor molecule which is

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:29.881
experienced inside the cell.
The way that the cell

00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:34.269
experience it is through some
sort of biochemical changes.

00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:36.950
Those changes usually involve
enzymes.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.893
They often involve the
generation of what are called

00:12:40.893 --> 00:12:45.378
'second messenger' molecules
which carry the signal further

00:12:45.378 --> 00:12:49.167
into the cell.
They often involve networks of

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:53.802
reactions, not just one enzyme
but a series of enzymes that

00:12:53.802 --> 00:12:58.740
serve to amplify each other.
A reaction performed by one

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:04.116
enzyme creates a product that
stimulates another enzyme that

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:08.048
creates a product,
and stimulates another enzyme,

00:13:08.048 --> 00:13:11.950
and through this cascade of
reactions you amplify and carry

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:16.467
the signal forward.
That's what's illustrated

00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:22.855
here with the end result being
that there's some change in the

00:13:22.855 --> 00:13:26.429
life of the cell.
What would that change be?

00:13:26.429 --> 00:13:31.340
Well, it might be that this
signal is a signal to divide.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.778
'It's time for you to
reproduce', and so the cellular

00:13:34.778 --> 00:13:39.543
response would be mitosis.
It could be that that signal is

00:13:39.543 --> 00:13:44.711
'you need more glucose',
and so the cellular response is

00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:49.222
to create more glucose
transporters to bring more

00:13:49.222 --> 00:13:53.166
glucose into the cell.
It could be the response is

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.720
'there's something dangerous in
the environment,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.922
we got to move away',
and so the response is for the

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.559
cell to crawl in the opposite
direction.

00:14:01.559 --> 00:14:06.699
There's a diverse range of
responses that might occur,

00:14:06.699 --> 00:14:12.615
but that response is initiated
by this simple chemical process

00:14:12.615 --> 00:14:16.299
of a ligand binding to a
receptor.

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:19.055
Now, the other thing to
keep in mind is that for any

00:14:19.055 --> 00:14:21.510
cell there's not just one
receptor on the cell,

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.571
there are thousands,
or hundreds of thousands of

00:14:29.571 --> 00:14:32.649
receptors.
All of them could potentially

00:14:32.649 --> 00:14:36.200
be receiving signals from a
ligand or a chemical.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.861
So, this pathway might not be
the only one that's being

00:14:39.861 --> 00:14:42.980
activated inside the cell at any
given time.

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.762
It might be getting a signal
from this receptor and a signal

00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:47.696
from this receptor,
and a signal from this

00:14:47.696 --> 00:14:51.254
receptor.
What the cell needs to be able

00:14:51.254 --> 00:14:56.750
to do is to integrate that
information into a response.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:00.486
You need to be able to
integrate that information into

00:15:00.486 --> 00:15:04.222
a response, and that happens
through these biochemical

00:15:04.222 --> 00:15:06.987
reactions.
I hope that makes sense as

00:15:06.987 --> 00:15:10.423
background, and I'm just going
to basically illustrate that

00:15:10.423 --> 00:15:13.682
basic concept with a few
examples throughout the rest of

00:15:13.682 --> 00:15:16.933
the lecture.
The other thing that's on this

00:15:16.933 --> 00:15:21.047
slide here is sort of a simple
analogy that I've already

00:15:21.047 --> 00:15:23.921
described.
If you think about receptor

00:15:23.921 --> 00:15:26.809
ligand system as an input into
the cell.

00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:31.588
If it was sound that was being
received that might be beating

00:15:31.588 --> 00:15:35.809
of a drum, for example,
that sound gets transduced.

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:39.299
We're used to thinking about
sound being tranduced;

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:43.178
for example,
being converted by acoustic

00:15:43.178 --> 00:15:49.045
waves into electrical signals
that can be recognized by your

00:15:49.045 --> 00:15:52.357
iPods.
This same thing happens here,

00:15:52.357 --> 00:15:56.193
there's a transduction,
one kind of a signal gets

00:15:56.193 --> 00:15:59.470
converted to another kind of a
signal.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.858
In the case of a
ligand-receptor,

00:16:01.858 --> 00:16:06.111
a chemical signal in the form
of a concentration of ligand

00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:09.470
gets converted into a
biochemical signal.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.325
That signal is carried here,
for example,

00:16:12.325 --> 00:16:16.609
by the concentration of second
messengers - the concentration

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.498
of something else.
Often that signal gets

00:16:19.498 --> 00:16:23.033
amplified so it can be used,
same thing happens inside cells

00:16:23.033 --> 00:16:25.670
and there's some output that's
generated.

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:33.298
What are - one of the -
this understanding of

00:16:33.298 --> 00:16:38.670
receptor-ligand interactions has
been really the biological basis

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.279
of much of the pharmaceutical
industry.

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:47.524
Much of the work that
pharmaceutical companies do in

00:16:47.524 --> 00:16:53.797
terms of searching for drugs is
searching for new ligands that

00:16:53.797 --> 00:16:59.556
activate receptors and create
biological responses inside

00:16:59.556 --> 00:17:02.522
cells.
There are two classes,

00:17:02.522 --> 00:17:06.775
two broad classes of drug sort
of type ligands that are

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:09.690
defined, agonists and
antagonists.

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:14.680
An agonist is a substance that
mimics the action of a natural

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.920
ligand, and I show you a couple
of examples of agonists here.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.651
Now, sometimes the agonist is
the natural ligand itself and

00:17:23.651 --> 00:17:27.769
that's - an example of that is
when you use insulin as a drug.

00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:30.445
Insulin is a naturally
occurring hormone,

00:17:30.445 --> 00:17:34.325
it's a protein hormone that
circulates in all of our bodies

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:36.799
and regulates glucose
metabolism.

00:17:36.799 --> 00:17:40.307
When you don't produce enough
insulin yourself,

00:17:40.307 --> 00:17:44.043
as diabetics do not,
then you can use insulin as a

00:17:44.043 --> 00:17:46.957
drug.
What insulin is doing inside

00:17:46.957 --> 00:17:51.571
your body is acting as a ligand
for insulin receptors which

00:17:51.571 --> 00:17:55.470
stimulate certain kinds of
cellular responses.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:56.619
I'll talk about that more in a
minute.

00:17:56.619 --> 00:17:59.831
Another example is in the
nervous system,

00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:04.065
patients that have Parkinson's
disease have too little of a

00:18:04.065 --> 00:18:08.725
natural ligand called dopamine.
That can be supplied by an

00:18:08.725 --> 00:18:13.423
antagonist called Aldopa - which
is not exactly the same as

00:18:13.423 --> 00:18:16.420
dopamine, it's slightly
different.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:20.419
It turns out when you give
Aldopa to people,

00:18:20.419 --> 00:18:26.279
it gets converted biochemically
into natural dopamine which then

00:18:26.279 --> 00:18:31.504
serves as its own agonist.
Sometimes you can design drugs

00:18:31.504 --> 00:18:35.968
that act like a natural ligand
without being the natural

00:18:35.968 --> 00:18:38.392
ligand.
We've identified many drugs

00:18:38.392 --> 00:18:41.079
that stimulate insulin
receptors, for example,

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.170
but they're not exactly
insulin,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.390
and those can potentially be
used as agonist type drugs.

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:50.490
An alternate is to design
an antagonist.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:54.430
This would an example of a
substance that inhibits the

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.040
action of a natural ligand and
they can inhibit in a variety of

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.375
ways.
Sometimes they inhibit by just

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:07.529
preventing the ligand from
interacting with its receptor.

00:19:07.529 --> 00:19:11.302
They prevent the ligand from
reaching its natural receptor,

00:19:11.302 --> 00:19:14.814
and so that antagonizes or
inhibits the function of the

00:19:14.814 --> 00:19:17.888
natural ligand.
Sometimes they act by actually

00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:21.638
binding to the receptor.
They bind sometimes better than

00:19:21.638 --> 00:19:25.574
the natural ligand does,
but they don't create the right

00:19:25.574 --> 00:19:29.484
biological reaction.
So, they bind to the receptor -

00:19:29.484 --> 00:19:33.941
they occupy the receptor so now
the natural ligand can't enter

00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:38.033
it but they don't create the
same sequence of biochemical

00:19:38.033 --> 00:19:41.629
events.
An example of a drug that works

00:19:41.629 --> 00:19:46.628
like that is the anti-cancer
drug Tamoxifen which binds to

00:19:46.628 --> 00:19:51.190
estrogen receptors and blocks
estrogen signaling.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.230
Many types of cancers,
particularly breast cancers,

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.940
many breast cancers but not
all, are sensitive to estrogen.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.910
Estrogen is a natural signal
for cells to grow.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.990
It's a natural signal for cells
to grow.

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.922
and if you design a drug that
blocks estrogen interaction you

00:20:07.922 --> 00:20:10.722
stop growth.
Stopping growth in tumors can

00:20:10.722 --> 00:20:14.680
be a very beneficial thing.
There's a whole class of

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:19.189
antagonistic drugs that have
been designed to influence your

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:22.888
cardiovascular system.
One class of them is

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:26.644
beta-blockers,
they bind to beta-adrenergic

00:20:26.644 --> 00:20:31.563
receptors, which are receptors
that exchange information

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:36.750
between your nervous system and
the contractile system that

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:41.579
beats your heart and that causes
the heartbeat.

00:20:41.579 --> 00:20:45.358
They can antagonize that
reaction, and a result they

00:20:45.358 --> 00:20:47.925
affect blood rate.
More importantly,

00:20:47.925 --> 00:20:51.693
they can affect blood pressure
as well, the strength of your

00:20:51.693 --> 00:20:55.270
heartbeat and the pressure that
your heart generates.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:59.709
These are just some examples.
I mentioned earlier,

00:20:59.709 --> 00:21:02.909
we thought about receptors as
being these blocks and membranes

00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:05.480
but there are different families
of receptors.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.086
One useful thing about
separating receptors into types

00:21:09.086 --> 00:21:12.964
or families is that we found
that many different receptors

00:21:12.964 --> 00:21:16.230
work by the same basic
underlying mechanism.

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:19.152
They might have different
ligands which stimulate them,

00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:22.019
but once they're stimulated
they work the same way.

00:21:22.019 --> 00:21:28.340
Understanding this has really
led to lots of advances in

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.359
biology.
We'll talk about that as we

00:21:31.359 --> 00:21:34.168
come to it.
What I want to do in here

00:21:34.168 --> 00:21:37.990
is just introduce some of the
basic kinds of receptors.

00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:41.543
The one that's on the top here
is called ligand-gated ion

00:21:41.543 --> 00:21:45.541
channel and an ion channel is a
protein that sits in the surface

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.668
of a cell.
It can exist in - a gated ion

00:21:48.668 --> 00:21:51.910
channel - can exist in one or
two states.

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.409
A state where it's closed,
so imagine a channel with a lid

00:21:55.409 --> 00:21:58.127
on top of it;
when it's closed nothing can go

00:21:58.127 --> 00:22:01.028
through the channel,
when it's open then things can

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.458
go through.
Now, these are special channels

00:22:03.458 --> 00:22:06.539
in that they only allow certain
molecules to pass through.

00:22:06.539 --> 00:22:10.415
The ones that are most
important in physiology are ones

00:22:10.415 --> 00:22:13.429
that only allow ions to go
through: sodium,

00:22:13.429 --> 00:22:16.730
potassium, chloride,
calcium, bicarbonate.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.403
We'll see just briefly in this
course if you go onto study

00:22:20.403 --> 00:22:25.532
physiology you learn much more,
about how these channels cause

00:22:25.532 --> 00:22:31.237
changes in the electrical
potential of cells which lead to

00:22:31.237 --> 00:22:34.940
events like conduction of a
nerve,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.309
or contraction of a muscle,
or beating of the heart.

00:22:39.309 --> 00:22:41.180
We'll talk a little bit about
that but not much.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.763
For these purposes think
about a channel,

00:22:43.763 --> 00:22:46.700
it only allows sodium to go
through for example.

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.797
It has a gate on it and that
gate is in open or close state

00:22:50.797 --> 00:22:54.329
depending on whether a ligand is
present or not.

00:22:54.329 --> 00:22:57.150
If a ligand comes and interacts
with a receptor,

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.951
it opens up;
if the ligand goes away,

00:22:59.951 --> 00:23:03.246
it closes.
In the presence of this ligand,

00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:06.647
this molecule,
it's open, it allows transport

00:23:06.647 --> 00:23:10.589
of this ion, when the ligand is
gone it doesn't.

00:23:10.589 --> 00:23:13.420
That changes a cell and here's
some examples of it.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.652
Many neurotransmitters that
carry signals between neurons in

00:23:17.652 --> 00:23:21.498
your brain work this way.
The cells that take an

00:23:21.498 --> 00:23:25.748
electrical signal,
which is coming down your nerve

00:23:25.748 --> 00:23:30.779
and convert it into a muscle
contraction work this way,

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:36.934
so 'neuro' nerve,
muscle junctions act based on

00:23:36.934 --> 00:23:42.243
ligand-gated ion channels.
Another family is called

00:23:42.243 --> 00:23:45.340
the G-protein coupled receptor.
It's called the G-protein

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.432
coupled receptor because it's a
receptor, like the one shown

00:23:48.432 --> 00:23:51.053
here, that's coupled to a
special molecule called a

00:23:51.053 --> 00:23:53.513
G-protein.
When the ligand is present it

00:23:53.513 --> 00:23:56.919
binds to the receptor outside
the cell and it activates this

00:23:56.919 --> 00:23:59.689
G-protein.
The G-protein then goes on to

00:23:59.689 --> 00:24:03.519
create some other biochemical
changes inside the cell.

00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:05.716
We're not going to talk about
this in any detail,

00:24:05.716 --> 00:24:08.369
there's a little bit more
detail described in your book.

00:24:08.369 --> 00:24:11.970
These are fascinating molecules
that turn out to be ubiquitous.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:16.517
They're everywhere in cells
throughout your body and they

00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:21.064
are responsible for lots of the
biochemistry of cell/cell

00:24:21.064 --> 00:24:25.392
interaction and signaling.
Another family is receptor

00:24:25.392 --> 00:24:28.356
tyrosine kinases,
I'll show another picture in a

00:24:28.356 --> 00:24:31.700
moment that tells you more about
what a kinase is,

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.436
but a kinase is basically an
enzyme that can add a

00:24:35.436 --> 00:24:40.367
phosphorous to another molecule.
It can 'phosphorylate' or add a

00:24:40.367 --> 00:24:45.407
phosphorous to another protein.
This is a signal - this passing

00:24:45.407 --> 00:24:50.322
of phosphorous - is a signal
that's used very frequently in

00:24:50.322 --> 00:24:53.865
intracellular communication.
I'll talk a little bit more

00:24:53.865 --> 00:24:55.724
about that in a minute.
In this case,

00:24:55.724 --> 00:25:00.623
a receptor tyrosine kinase is a
receptor molecule that binds a

00:25:00.623 --> 00:25:05.120
ligand at its surface outside
the cell and initiates this

00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:09.136
enzyme activity - this kinase
activity - and causes

00:25:09.136 --> 00:25:12.589
phosphorylation of another
molecule.

00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:16.534
This is - there are also other
receptors that are linked to

00:25:16.534 --> 00:25:20.372
other enzymes besides kinases.
I've included that as a general

00:25:20.372 --> 00:25:22.821
family here.
So, these are receptors,

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.815
for example,
that bind the ligand and then

00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:29.757
liberate an enzyme which
promotes some sort of reaction

00:25:29.757 --> 00:25:35.397
inside the cell,
often it's kinases but doesn't

00:25:35.397 --> 00:25:39.162
have to be.
One of the enzymes that

00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:43.251
often gets activated is an
enzyme which converts ATP,

00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:47.339
a small molecule that is inside
all of our cells.

00:25:47.339 --> 00:25:54.110
ATP is famous for its ability
to store energy but it's also a

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:58.388
messenger molecule.
When a certain enzyme is

00:25:58.388 --> 00:26:02.204
activated inside cells,
ATP gets converted into a

00:26:02.204 --> 00:26:06.876
molecule called cyclic AMP,
and cyclic AMP is an example of

00:26:06.876 --> 00:26:10.490
one of these molecules called
second messengers.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:16.016
It gets produced in response to
a signal so there's a binding of

00:26:16.016 --> 00:26:20.780
a ligand to a receptor,
the enzyme that does this

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.539
conversion is activated and more
cycle AMP is released.

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:29.561
As cyclic AMP levels rise
inside the cell,

00:26:29.561 --> 00:26:32.509
something about cell behavior
changes.

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:35.806
Now, one of the advantages
of having second messengers is

00:26:35.806 --> 00:26:38.828
this is one way that you can
integrate between different

00:26:38.828 --> 00:26:41.630
receptor systems that are acting
inside a cell.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.493
If you have two different
ligands stimulating two

00:26:45.493 --> 00:26:49.357
different receptors,
and one causes activation of

00:26:49.357 --> 00:26:52.980
this enzyme and generation of
cyclic AMP,

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.539
cyclic AMP levels will start to
rise.

00:26:56.539 --> 00:27:01.485
If another receptor operating
from a different ligand does the

00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:06.106
same thing, generates an enzyme
which causes cyclic AMP to

00:27:06.106 --> 00:27:09.876
increase,
the rate of cyclic AMP increase

00:27:09.876 --> 00:27:15.660
is going to go up faster than if
only one of these was activated.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.489
The cell is going to experience
something different inside

00:27:19.489 --> 00:27:23.519
because both receptors were
activated instead of just one.

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:28.316
Sometimes second messengers
collect signals from a variety

00:27:28.316 --> 00:27:33.275
of different receptor systems,
translate them into one kind of

00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:36.563
internal change,
and the cell then just has to

00:27:36.563 --> 00:27:39.340
know about that one thing
changing.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:44.678
Does that make sense?
This is another example of a

00:27:44.678 --> 00:27:47.420
second messenger,
the inositol lipid pathway.

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.089
These are molecules that exist
naturally in cell membranes and

00:27:51.089 --> 00:27:54.457
are activated by certain enzymes
and kinases generated by

00:27:54.457 --> 00:27:56.986
receptors.
More is said about this in the

00:27:56.986 --> 00:28:00.246
book I just include it here as
an example, but it's sort of

00:28:00.246 --> 00:28:03.450
beyond the scope of what I
wanted to talk about today.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.843
I did want to say a little
bit more about kinases because

00:28:06.843 --> 00:28:09.897
they're so important in
intracellular communication and

00:28:09.897 --> 00:28:13.120
kinases take advantage of the
fact that proteins can often

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:16.947
exist in more than one state,
and that's what makes them

00:28:16.947 --> 00:28:21.327
useful molecules inside cells.
That's what makes proteins

00:28:21.327 --> 00:28:25.430
useful in transmitting or
responding to signals.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:29.877
Often the state of a protein
depends on whether it's

00:28:29.877 --> 00:28:33.877
phosphorylated or not.
Now, being phosphorylated means

00:28:33.877 --> 00:28:37.200
that a phosphate group has been
added to the protein,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.915
and phosphate groups can only
be added to certain amino acids

00:28:40.915 --> 00:28:44.695
along a protein.
Proteins are only susceptible

00:28:44.695 --> 00:28:50.025
to phosphorylation if they have
certain kinds of amino acid

00:28:50.025 --> 00:28:53.435
sequences.
One of the amino acids that can

00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:56.579
be phosphorylated is tyrosine,
for example.

00:28:56.579 --> 00:29:00.625
So, a protein that has tyrosine
and it has tyrosine in a

00:29:00.625 --> 00:29:04.744
position such that it's on the
outside of the protein and

00:29:04.744 --> 00:29:09.009
accessible to chemical reaction
can be phosphorylated.

00:29:09.009 --> 00:29:13.036
What a kinase enzyme does is
that it recognizes this protein,

00:29:13.036 --> 00:29:15.854
and for example,
the tyrosine that's on the

00:29:15.854 --> 00:29:19.243
protein.
It performs a chemical reaction

00:29:19.243 --> 00:29:22.910
on the protein,
taking a phosphorous from ATP

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.910
and moving that phosphorous onto
the protein.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:31.622
Now, you know already,
or you could review in Chapter

00:29:31.622 --> 00:29:36.082
4 that I provided to you,
something about how proteins

00:29:36.082 --> 00:29:38.931
work.
You know that the function of a

00:29:38.931 --> 00:29:42.170
protein is intimately related to
its structure.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:46.656
Proteins have three dimensional
structures in solution and their

00:29:46.656 --> 00:29:49.220
structure determines what they
do.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:52.845
Sometimes subtle changes in the
structure of a protein can

00:29:52.845 --> 00:29:56.470
convert it from an active state
into an inactive state.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:01.132
That's one of the beauties of
proteins as working molecules is

00:30:01.132 --> 00:30:05.259
that their structure can be
changed by subtle means.

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:09.952
Sometimes that subtle change
can lead to a big change in the

00:30:09.952 --> 00:30:15.566
function of the protein.
Well, imagine if that change in

00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:21.743
structure could be switched on
and off by addition of a

00:30:21.743 --> 00:30:25.605
phosphorous;
and in fact it can in many

00:30:25.605 --> 00:30:28.274
proteins.
Some proteins can be switched

00:30:28.274 --> 00:30:31.836
from an 'off' position where
they don't do anything to an

00:30:31.836 --> 00:30:35.588
'on' position where they now do
something by only a chemical

00:30:35.588 --> 00:30:38.960
reaction like this where a
phosphorous is added.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.362
Kinases can,
in many cases,

00:30:41.362 --> 00:30:45.287
serve as a mechanism for
switching a protein on or

00:30:45.287 --> 00:30:49.282
switching a protein off.
If that protein is an enzyme

00:30:49.282 --> 00:30:52.349
then you've - and you've
switched it from an 'off'

00:30:52.349 --> 00:30:55.792
position where it's not
catalyzing a reaction to an 'on'

00:30:55.792 --> 00:30:59.419
position where it is,
you've changed the biochemical

00:30:59.419 --> 00:31:02.417
state of the cell,
you've changed the chemical

00:31:02.417 --> 00:31:05.350
reactions that can occur within
the cell,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:10.000
and you've changed its behavior.
That's a very simplified

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.339
version of why kinases are
important.

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:17.626
Well, if this kinase
happens to turn this protein on

00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:20.972
then you would like to have a
mechanism to turn it off as

00:31:20.972 --> 00:31:23.514
well.
The other beauty about -

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:28.191
beautiful thing about proteins
is that if you make subtle

00:31:28.191 --> 00:31:32.033
conformational changes,
often those changes are

00:31:32.033 --> 00:31:34.811
reversible.
Now, you all know that we can

00:31:34.811 --> 00:31:37.744
make irreversible changes in
proteins, you can denature them

00:31:37.744 --> 00:31:40.357
completely,
that's what happens when you

00:31:40.357 --> 00:31:44.709
cook an egg for example.
You've taken all the proteins

00:31:44.709 --> 00:31:48.350
inside the white of the egg,
for example,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:52.747
you raise the temperature.
Tou make not small changes in

00:31:52.747 --> 00:31:55.900
their chemistry but big changes
in their chemistry.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.099
Tou denature them,
you can watch them denature

00:31:59.099 --> 00:32:03.650
because the egg white turns from
clear to white and it doesn't go

00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:06.561
back.
You've irreversibly changed

00:32:06.561 --> 00:32:11.691
that substance because you've
changed the structure of all the

00:32:11.691 --> 00:32:15.031
proteins inside.
That - irreversible changes

00:32:15.031 --> 00:32:18.458
happen all the time too but here
I'm talking about very subtle

00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:21.548
small changes where you're
changing the structure of the

00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:24.920
protein but only a little bit
such that it can go back.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:28.232
One way that you could switch
this on and off inside the cell

00:32:28.232 --> 00:32:30.220
is by taking off this
phosphorous,

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.989
proteins enzymes that do this
opposite reaction,

00:32:33.989 --> 00:32:38.160
the opposite to kinases are
called phosphokinases.

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.741
You could imagine a protein
that's existing inside a cell at

00:32:42.741 --> 00:32:46.071
some level of abundance.
There are 100 of these

00:32:46.071 --> 00:32:49.825
molecules, when a receptor gets
activated a kinase activity gets

00:32:49.825 --> 00:32:52.769
activated,
the kinase acts on the protein,

00:32:52.769 --> 00:32:56.900
the protein gets switched on,
something new starts to happen

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.775
inside the cell.
Another receptor eventually

00:33:00.775 --> 00:33:05.865
activates a phosphatase,
that phosphatase now turns the

00:33:05.865 --> 00:33:09.012
protein off.
It's a switch that from outside

00:33:09.012 --> 00:33:11.360
can be used to change the life
of a cell.

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:18.852
That was some,
not too complicated,

00:33:18.852 --> 00:33:25.266
but hopefully understandable
description of a whole area of

00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:29.579
biology called signal
transduction.

00:33:29.579 --> 00:33:32.001
If you hear about signal
transduction in biology,

00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:34.725
people that study signal
transduction are studying just

00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:39.473
these things we talked about,
how biochemical messages get

00:33:39.473 --> 00:33:44.099
transferred into cells and
through cells.

00:33:44.099 --> 00:33:47.816
I want to look at a slightly
higher level of magnification

00:33:47.816 --> 00:33:51.990
now and think about different
kinds of cellular communication.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.619
One kind of cellular
communication occurs by similar

00:33:55.619 --> 00:33:58.680
mechanisms to what we were
talking about.

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.369
Here, there are receptors on
one cell and the ligand that

00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:05.400
they experience is not a
dissolved molecule,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:10.400
but actually a molecule that's
attached to another cell.

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.298
Sometimes signals are
transmitted between cells by

00:34:14.298 --> 00:34:17.587
cell/cell contact.
By cell/cell contact,

00:34:17.587 --> 00:34:22.599
I mean that there's a receptor
in one cell that makes some kind

00:34:22.599 --> 00:34:27.530
of a chemical interaction with a
receptor in another cell.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:30.806
Depending on which cell you are
you would call one the

00:34:30.806 --> 00:34:33.280
'receptor' and the other the
'ligand'.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.812
This is a mode of communication
that's used very frequently in

00:34:37.812 --> 00:34:40.710
the immune system as we'll see
later.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.256
It's the way,
for example,

00:34:42.256 --> 00:34:45.721
that foreign molecules or
antigens get presented to cells

00:34:45.721 --> 00:34:49.433
of your immune system in order
to start the process of making

00:34:49.433 --> 00:34:53.782
an immune response,
so sometimes a cell/cell

00:34:53.782 --> 00:34:56.607
interaction.
The rest of these examples

00:34:56.607 --> 00:34:59.352
refer to receptors as I've been
describing them and ligands that

00:34:59.352 --> 00:35:01.269
are soluble and can move around
the body.

00:35:01.269 --> 00:35:04.548
It's useful to separate these
kinds of signals into three

00:35:04.548 --> 00:35:07.103
categories.
One is shown at the top here,

00:35:07.103 --> 00:35:09.429
its call autocrine.
This is, maybe,

00:35:09.429 --> 00:35:13.135
the strangest because the
ligand that stimulates the

00:35:13.135 --> 00:35:16.260
receptor is produced by the cell
itself;

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:21.110
so sometimes cells make signals
that they receive.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.493
This is commonly used in the
immune system as well,

00:35:24.493 --> 00:35:27.199
but it's a way of amplifying a
signal.

00:35:27.199 --> 00:35:30.406
For example,
what if I activated this cell

00:35:30.406 --> 00:35:34.630
by encouraging it to produce
this particular ligand?

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.970
That ligand was one for which
the cell had a receptor that

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:45.030
further encouraged it to produce
more of the ligand.

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.645
Well, then you could imagine a
cycle here where activation of

00:35:48.645 --> 00:35:51.960
the receptor is leading to
production of more ligand,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.727
is leading to activation of the
receptor and production of a

00:35:54.727 --> 00:35:57.287
ligand.
That's an example of a process

00:35:57.287 --> 00:36:01.105
called positive feedback.
The more the receptor gets

00:36:01.105 --> 00:36:04.809
activated the more feedback it
gets to activate.

00:36:04.809 --> 00:36:09.510
That can be a very strong
amplifying response,

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:15.150
and that happens in the immune
system in many cases.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:18.081
An example is production of
certain molecules called

00:36:18.081 --> 00:36:20.840
cytokines by T-cells that
activate themselves.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.809
Another example is called
paracrine.

00:36:24.809 --> 00:36:28.111
Here, what's different between
autocrine and paracrine is that

00:36:28.111 --> 00:36:31.088
there's some distance between
the cell that produces the

00:36:31.088 --> 00:36:33.739
signal and the cell that
receives the signal,

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:36.544
but it's not too great a
distance because the blood

00:36:36.544 --> 00:36:38.619
system doesn't have to be
involved.

00:36:38.619 --> 00:36:42.577
Molecules are produced here and
they flow directly over,

00:36:42.577 --> 00:36:46.320
usually by diffusion,
to the neighboring molecule.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.167
'Para' means near,
'paracrine' means 'a signal

00:36:50.167 --> 00:36:53.880
from nearby'.
Endocrine are signals that

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.960
get carried through the blood
system.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:00.310
The cell that's producing the
signal produces enough of the

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:02.909
molecule so that it enters the
bloodstream,

00:37:02.909 --> 00:37:05.666
it circulates throughout your
body, eventually it reaches a

00:37:05.666 --> 00:37:08.988
cell at a great distance,
which has a receptor for that

00:37:08.988 --> 00:37:11.590
ligand and the signal gets
received.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.643
An example of that is,
of course, insulin which is

00:37:14.643 --> 00:37:18.008
produced by cells of the
pancreas and acts on cells all

00:37:18.008 --> 00:37:20.815
over the body.
Adrenaline is another one,

00:37:20.815 --> 00:37:24.444
produced by cells in your
adrenal gland but used by cells

00:37:24.444 --> 00:37:25.870
all over your body.

00:37:30.769 --> 00:37:34.483
Well, the endocrine system
is a body organ system that is

00:37:34.483 --> 00:37:38.321
specialized in producing these
kinds of signals that are used -

00:37:38.321 --> 00:37:42.159
that accumulate in the blood and
are used by cells all over the

00:37:42.159 --> 00:37:44.702
body.
There are two general classes

00:37:44.702 --> 00:37:48.300
of molecules that are produced
by the endocrine system.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:52.581
All of the molecules are called
hormones, so a hormone is

00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:56.862
another name for a ligand that
operates in this endocrine

00:37:56.862 --> 00:38:00.213
fashion.
A hormone is just a ligand that

00:38:00.213 --> 00:38:03.039
operates in this endocrine
fashion.

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:07.074
Hormones can be proteins,
endocrine hormones can be

00:38:07.074 --> 00:38:11.672
proteins, meaning they're large
molecules that are usually

00:38:11.672 --> 00:38:15.699
fairly water soluble,
or they can be steroids.

00:38:15.699 --> 00:38:19.783
Steroids are small molecules -
much smaller than proteins -

00:38:19.783 --> 00:38:24.360
smaller molecules that tend to
be hydrophobic or lipid soluble.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.291
Example, protein hormones are
insulin which we've talked about

00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:31.341
before and glucagon,
and growth hormone which we

00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:35.149
haven't talked about but that's
very important during periods of

00:38:35.149 --> 00:38:37.311
life like adolescence,
for example,

00:38:37.311 --> 00:38:39.809
when rapid growth of your bones
is occurring.

00:38:39.809 --> 00:38:44.454
Well, insulin is a protein,
it's produced by cells in the

00:38:44.454 --> 00:38:47.550
pancreas, it circulates in your
blood.

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.409
It can't enter cells because
it's too big and it's too water

00:38:51.409 --> 00:38:54.550
soluble so it can't go through
cell membranes.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:58.721
So, it interacts with receptors
called insulin receptors that

00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:01.849
are on cells that are sensitive
to insulin.

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:04.021
Steroid hormones,
on the other hand,

00:39:04.021 --> 00:39:06.690
molecules like testosterone and
estrogen,

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:10.440
progesterone,
the sex steroids that determine

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:15.213
sexual characteristics and are
important for reproductive

00:39:15.213 --> 00:39:20.071
function are molecules that are
all derived from a similar

00:39:20.071 --> 00:39:23.221
source.
Many of them are derived from

00:39:23.221 --> 00:39:26.883
cholesterol and they're
hydrophobic, which means they

00:39:26.883 --> 00:39:29.699
can penetrate through cell
membranes.

00:39:29.699 --> 00:39:33.880
So, it doesn't need to bind to
a receptor on the surface of the

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.926
cell in order to work because
the molecule can actually enter

00:39:37.926 --> 00:39:41.201
the cell directly.
Many steroid hormones act

00:39:41.201 --> 00:39:45.356
because they bind to cellulars -
to receptors that are deep

00:39:45.356 --> 00:39:48.579
within the cell,
often inside the nucleus.

00:39:48.579 --> 00:39:51.044
I'll show how that works in
just a moment,

00:39:51.044 --> 00:39:53.690
but estrogen for example,
is one of those.

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:57.463
When estrogen is present it can
enter cells in the vicinity and

00:39:57.463 --> 00:40:00.750
it can bind to receptors that
are deep inside cells.

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:03.296
This is a new concept,
receptors don't have to be

00:40:03.296 --> 00:40:07.048
these molecules on cell surface,
there can be receptors that

00:40:07.048 --> 00:40:10.800
exist in other places within the
cell, for example.

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.474
Go a little bit further
with this schematic and talking

00:40:15.474 --> 00:40:19.428
about what insulin does.
You know about this but maybe

00:40:19.428 --> 00:40:22.889
you haven't thought about it at
this level of detail,

00:40:22.889 --> 00:40:25.193
but you know that when you -
after you eat,

00:40:25.193 --> 00:40:28.537
you eat lunch for example.
After class you're going to go

00:40:28.537 --> 00:40:31.429
to lunch, you're going to eat
whatever you eat.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:34.429
Hopefully it's not a Snickers
bar but let's assume it is a

00:40:34.429 --> 00:40:37.585
Snicker's bar and your blood
glucose is going to rise because

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:41.450
you're taking a lot of sugar in.
When it does your pancreas

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:45.847
receives a signal that your
blood glucose has started to go

00:40:45.847 --> 00:40:50.513
up, and it will secrete insulin.
So, there are cells in your

00:40:50.513 --> 00:40:55.211
pancreas which recognize glucose
levels and they secrete insulin

00:40:55.211 --> 00:40:57.555
in response.
When they do that,

00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:01.639
this insulin then starts to
circulate throughout the blood.

00:41:01.639 --> 00:41:04.169
If you measured,
if somebody measured levels of

00:41:04.169 --> 00:41:05.989
insulin in your blood after
lunch,

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:08.998
if they took it ten minutes,
30 minutes, an hour,

00:41:08.998 --> 00:41:11.630
you would see that it's going
slowly up.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.273
As it's going up,
it's circulating around your

00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:17.795
body.
Most cells in your body have

00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:21.844
insulin receptors so insulin is
starting to bind to insulin

00:41:21.844 --> 00:41:25.204
receptors on those cells.
When it does it makes

00:41:25.204 --> 00:41:29.216
biochemical changes inside the
cells and one of the things it

00:41:29.216 --> 00:41:33.429
does is increase glucose uptake
into certain kinds of cells,

00:41:33.429 --> 00:41:36.159
particularly fat cells and
muscle cells.

00:41:36.159 --> 00:41:40.167
Well, why does it increase
uptake of glucose into muscle

00:41:40.167 --> 00:41:42.843
cells?
Because muscle can use and

00:41:42.843 --> 00:41:46.949
frequently is using glucose as a
source of energy.

00:41:46.949 --> 00:41:50.337
So, when there is extra glucose
you want to put it into the

00:41:50.337 --> 00:41:52.440
cells that can use it
immediately.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.860
Why does it go into fat
cells?

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.957
Because maybe you ate more
glucose than you needed

00:41:57.957 --> 00:42:01.940
immediately and so it goes into
cells that can store glucose.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:05.836
That's what fat cells do,
they convert glucose into a

00:42:05.836 --> 00:42:09.224
form for storage.
Well, how does glucose uptake

00:42:09.224 --> 00:42:13.210
get enhanced in those cells?
It gets enhanced because when

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.973
insulin binds to the insulin
receptor, it activates the

00:42:16.973 --> 00:42:19.119
receptor.
How does it activate it?

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:23.475
It generates a kinase activity
which leads to phosphorylation

00:42:23.475 --> 00:42:26.779
of the protein.
Insulin binding leads to

00:42:26.779 --> 00:42:30.401
phosphorylation,
leads to other biochemical

00:42:30.401 --> 00:42:33.755
changes.
Eventually what happens is that

00:42:33.755 --> 00:42:38.179
glucose transport molecules
which are expressed and stored

00:42:38.179 --> 00:42:42.059
inside the cell get shuttled up
to the surface,

00:42:42.059 --> 00:42:47.784
so the cells permeability to
glucose goes up and more glucose

00:42:47.784 --> 00:42:50.646
can come in.
This is a highly simplified

00:42:50.646 --> 00:42:54.151
version, but sort of closes the
loop on what we've been talking

00:42:54.151 --> 00:42:56.434
about.
Insulin, the ligand binds to

00:42:56.434 --> 00:42:58.905
its receptor,
creates a change through a

00:42:58.905 --> 00:43:02.537
kinase activity that's exposed,
which leads to other

00:43:02.537 --> 00:43:06.305
biochemical changes,
which leads to a change in cell

00:43:06.305 --> 00:43:10.811
behavior - in this case the cell
behavior is that more glucose

00:43:10.811 --> 00:43:15.244
transporters are brought to the
membrane and more glucose can

00:43:15.244 --> 00:43:18.380
enter the cell.
Does this make sense?

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:21.098
Sometime after you've
eaten, say you had this Snickers

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:23.960
bar at lunchtime and you don't
have time to get anything else

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:27.092
to eat during the day,
your blood glucose level will

00:43:27.092 --> 00:43:29.269
go down.
Why does it go down?

00:43:29.269 --> 00:43:32.246
Well, one because you're not
taking anymore glucose in,

00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:35.444
but the other because when you
did eat glucose you got more

00:43:35.444 --> 00:43:38.586
insulin and the glucose got
shuttled into cells where it's

00:43:38.586 --> 00:43:42.139
either used or stored.
So, that brings your glucose

00:43:42.139 --> 00:43:45.783
level down.
Another hormone gets produced

00:43:45.783 --> 00:43:50.486
by the pancreas in response to
low glucose levels,

00:43:50.486 --> 00:43:54.880
it's called glucagon.
It has many of the opposite

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:58.905
effects that insulin has,
so not only does insulin go

00:43:58.905 --> 00:44:03.007
down and stop these behaviors
but a new hormone called

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:07.420
glucagon gets produced which
reinforces that change.

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:12.730
These - you're going between
these states throughout the day.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:19.239
Where your cells experience
those states is through these

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:25.400
extra cellular ligands called
insulin and glucagon.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.577
Steroid hormones can
operate in a different way

00:44:28.577 --> 00:44:31.769
because of their structure.
They're small molecules,

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:34.695
they're lipid soluble,
they can go from extracellular

00:44:34.695 --> 00:44:38.281
to intracellular.
Let's take an example of

00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:42.635
estrogen, for example.
A small molecule gets produced

00:44:42.635 --> 00:44:46.559
by cells in one part of the
body, circulates in the blood,

00:44:46.559 --> 00:44:50.144
estrogen enters cells,
and sometimes that estrogen is

00:44:50.144 --> 00:44:52.970
able to penetrate deep within
the cell,

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:58.550
even into the nucleus.
The receptor for estrogen is a

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:03.780
special molecule called a DNA
binding factor.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:10.360
Estrogen can combine with this
receptor to form a new sort of

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:16.589
unit which interacts with DNA.
When this bound receptor

00:45:16.589 --> 00:45:21.121
interacts with DNA it could,
for example,

00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:25.539
turn on expression of a target
gene.

00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:29.825
One of the things that estrogen
does when cells are exposed to

00:45:29.825 --> 00:45:33.759
estrogen is that certain genes
get turned on that weren't

00:45:33.759 --> 00:45:36.639
turned on in the estrogen-free
state.

00:45:36.639 --> 00:45:40.711
It leads to expression of new
genes, production of new

00:45:40.711 --> 00:45:44.630
proteins, and a change in a
behavior of the cell.

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:48.173
Sometimes receptors,
when they interact with

00:45:48.173 --> 00:45:52.545
ligands, create changes in what
proteins are actually being

00:45:52.545 --> 00:45:56.111
produced by the cell.
This is one very direct way for

00:45:56.111 --> 00:45:59.638
that to happen.
These kinds of molecules which

00:45:59.638 --> 00:46:03.627
activate genes,
they're activating the process

00:46:03.627 --> 00:46:07.075
of transcription.
They're sometimes called

00:46:07.075 --> 00:46:11.404
transcription factors and this
is an example of a transcription

00:46:11.404 --> 00:46:15.732
factor that is itself activated
or turned on by the presence of

00:46:15.732 --> 00:46:16.780
a steroid.

00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.139
That's the end of what I wanted
to say today.

00:46:25.139 --> 00:46:27.579
What we're going to talk about
next time, and I encourage to

00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:30.019
read ahead because you'll see
that there's a lot more detail

00:46:30.019 --> 00:46:32.170
in Chapter 6 than what we're
talking about here,

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:34.608
I've emphasized the main
points, the ones that I think

00:46:34.608 --> 00:46:36.632
are important,
that are clearly important for

00:46:36.632 --> 00:46:39.106
your understanding.
We're going to take these

00:46:39.106 --> 00:46:42.336
general topics and talk about
how they work in the nervous

00:46:42.336 --> 00:46:45.000
system and the immune system
next time.

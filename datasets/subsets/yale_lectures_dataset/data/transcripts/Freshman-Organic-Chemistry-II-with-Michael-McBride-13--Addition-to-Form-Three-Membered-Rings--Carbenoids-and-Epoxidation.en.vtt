00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:01.967
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, so we've
been 

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:03.667
talking about electrophilic 

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:07.233
addition and the nucleophilic
aspect of it. 

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:11.200
Today we'll extend that to talk
about cycloaddition and 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.633
also there'll be some practical
applications with 

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:19.200
respect to epoxides and acetals
and how they work. 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.600
So first, about that problem I
gave you last time, about 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.100
drawing nice curved arrows to
show the pinacol 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.333
rearrangement. 

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.967
So, how does it start out? 

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:30.733
What's the first thing that
happens? 

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:35.133
Wells, do you have an idea for
acid catalysis here? 

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.767
What's the very first thing that
happens? 

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:46.233
Too early in the morning? 

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:46.933
Chris, what do you say? 

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:48.200
STUDENT: The proton protonates.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.600
PROFESSOR: Protonates what? 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.067
STUDENT: Probably OH. 

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:53.200
PROFESSOR: OK. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.233
So we'll protonate the OH, and
then water can leave. Why is 

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:58.567
it good for water to leave,
Chris? 

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:01.000
STUDENT: The pKa of hydronium is
low, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.100
negative. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, O3+
[correction: H3O+] 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.067
is good at losing things, how
about the other aspect of it? 

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:12.600
How about the thing that's
leaving, other than the water? 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.533
STUDENT: It's charged? 

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.567
PROFESSOR: Yeah, how about where
the charge goes? 

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:16.400
STUDENT: Away. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.600
PROFESSOR: What's it going to be
when the water leaves? 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.200
The water will be neutral. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.467
Pardon me. 

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.933
STUDENT: It will go from a
positive charge to a neutral 

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:24.200
charge in this case. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.733
PROFESSOR: The water will, but
we care about the organic 

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.933
thing more than about the water.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:29.867
What will be left? 

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:30.867
STUDENT: Negative charge. 

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.167
PROFESSOR: No, no. 

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.933
The thing is a cation, if you
lose neutral water, 

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.767
the charge will stay. 

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:39.633
Where will it be? 

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.400
STUDENT: On the carbon. 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.500
PROFESSOR: Is that a good place
for it to be? 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.667
STUDENT: Yes. 

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:47.500
PROFESSOR: Why? 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.367
Why is that good? 

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:49.200
STUDENT: It's tertiary. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.000
PROFESSOR: It's tertiary. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.333
All right, so we get a nice
tertiary cation. 

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:59.500
What did anybody think about the
next step here? 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.200
Yeah, Kate. 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.567
STUDENT: I thought that maybe
there was a methide shift. 

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:06.667
PROFESSOR: A methide shift,
good. 

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:09.800
So the methide could shift over,
a rearrangement, and now 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.500
you have this cation. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.600
Now, Kate, you're going to tell
me about this cation. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.233
We started already with a very
good cation, a tertiary 

00:02:18.233 --> 00:02:21.900
cation, right, that's as good as
they get with-- 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.200
unless you have double bonds
next door. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.967
OK. 

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:26.400
But, what's the driving force? 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Why should it go this direction?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.633
What's good about being on the
right? 

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:37.000
STUDENT: It has to do with the
fact the CO 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.367
bond is a low LUMO. 

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:45.967
PROFESSOR: No, I don't think you
could say 

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:48.100
the CO, it's true-- 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.167
the CO bond is a lower LUMO. 

00:02:51.167 --> 00:02:54.500
But to the extent that the
oxygen, the reason it's low is 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.533
because of the oxygen, right. 

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.033
And, that oxygen is withdrawing
charge from the 

00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:02.800
carbon, withdrawing electrons
from the carbon, tending to 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.700
make the carbon positive anyhow.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.067
So, if a carbon is already
positive, it's not such a 

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:11.767
great place to put more positive
charge. 

00:03:11.767 --> 00:03:15.000
So, to the extent that that
sigma bond is important, you'd 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.367
think it'd go the other
direction. 

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.800
The oxygen would be electron
withdrawing and destabilize 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.133
the cation. 

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:25.133
Can anybody see why it could be
good to have 

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.167
the oxygen next door? 

00:03:26.167 --> 00:03:28.233
It's certainly not that sigma
bond. 

00:03:36.867 --> 00:03:39.833
STUDENT: Isn't the unshared pair
the reason? 

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:41.600
PROFESSOR: What about the
unshared pair? 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.467
STUDENT: They stabilize the
positive charge. 

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.867
PROFESSOR: You know actually, I
would say 

00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:49.467
the other way around. 

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:54.300
The electrons are something
real, right, and they get 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.200
stabilized by mixing with the
low vacant orbital that's 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.167
associated with the positive
charge. 

00:04:00.167 --> 00:04:02.733
It's the electrons that get
lower in energy. 

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.967
OK, but you're absolutely right,
so you can draw a 

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:07.500
resonance structure like that,
and that's why it's good to go 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.933
to the right. 

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:10.800
OK, now, how do you get from
there to the product? 

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:17.767
Jack? 

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.467
STUDENT: Hydrogen can go off. 

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:24.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you just lose a
proton, right, and you've 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.733
got the product. 

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.200
So, that's the mechanism of the
pinacol rearrangement. 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.133
It's all steps that you know
well, but you have to think 

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:34.633
and put them together, so that's
just 

00:04:34.633 --> 00:04:36.600
an exercise in that. 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.567
OK, now back to these
simultaneous reactions that 

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:42.367
are involved in addition to
alkenes. 

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:46.833
Simultaneous in the sense that
there's both electrophile, 

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:48.500
which is what they're typically
called, 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.533
electrophilic additions, but,
also a nucleophile that's 

00:04:51.533 --> 00:04:53.200
participating at the same time.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.600
We saw this last time with
dichlorocarbene which you 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.967
remember came on edge on, and
then rotated in order to make 

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:02.967
the two new bonds to give us
cyclopropane. 

00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:06.033
We saw it in hydroboration,
where the vacant orbital on 

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:12.300
the B attacks, but at the same
time the high HOMO B-H, mixes 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.433
with the pi-star orbital. 

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:22.633
OK, so, now we're going to go on
to a different kind of a 

00:05:22.633 --> 00:05:25.833
way of making a cyclopropane
with what's called the 

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:30.633
Simmons-Smith reagent, and then
into epoxidation, adding 

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:33.933
just an oxygen to a double bond
to give us 3-membered 

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:39.133
oxirane ring, and then
ozonolysis which is a more 

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:44.333
dramatic kind of cycloaddition
to give a ring, and then we 

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:48.700
probably won't get today to
catalytic hydrogenation, and 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.400
to polymerization and
metathesis, 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.433
where metals are involved. 

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.467
So, we'll do those others today.

00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:59.667
First, the so called
Simmons-Smith 

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:01.900
reagent or a carbenoid. 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.000
We talked about CCl2, a carbene,
last time, that's a 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.667
free species, it's pretty
reactive, but it floats free. 

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:12.067
It has an existence. 

00:06:12.067 --> 00:06:15.200
These are called carbenoids,
because they don't really give 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.733
a free carbene, but they give a
product as if it were a 

00:06:18.733 --> 00:06:23.867
carbene, that is the CH2 in a
3-membered ring. 

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:31.067
The reagents as you can see, are
methylene iodide, CH2I2, 

00:06:31.067 --> 00:06:34.733
and the thing called zinc-copper
couple, and I 

00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:37.000
don't know where the name couple
came from except that 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.400
there two metals there. 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.400
But it, turned out that having a
little copper with the zinc 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.767
made it work better. 

00:06:42.767 --> 00:06:46.567
So, I don't know, anyhow, zinc
is the operative group here, 

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:49.200
but copper clearly has something
to do with it. 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.900
This was developed at DuPont
Central Research in 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.367
Wilmington, Delaware, where
Howard Simmons was the 

00:06:55.367 --> 00:06:57.100
Director of Research. 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.900
First, a word about metals and
alkyl halides. 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.267
So, you have a metal and an
alkyl halide. 

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:07.800
Now, metals tend to be over on
the left of the periodic 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.167
table, what does that mean about
their electrons? 

00:07:13.167 --> 00:07:16.900
Are the highest valence
electrons held tightly or are 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.900
they able to give up electrons?

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.067
Compared to most things. 

00:07:21.067 --> 00:07:22.333
Do they have a high HOMO? 

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.433
Things that are on the left of
the periodic table don't have 

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:31.200
such a big nuclear charge, given
the row they are in, so 

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.633
they're relatively good at
giving up electrons. 

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:35.633
How about RX? 

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:40.467
What makes it reactive, a halide
on R? 

00:07:40.467 --> 00:07:42.167
What's its characteristic
reactivity? 

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:42.467
Ayesha. 

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:44.600
STUDENT: Low LUMO, sigma-star. 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.133
PROFESSOR: Low LUMO, sigma-star.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.500
So, we have something that can
give electrons and something 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.833
that can take it, so it won't
surprise you that you can get 

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:56.800
an electronic transfer from the
metal, and it's just a 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.767
metallic metal, it's not an ion
in 

00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:00.900
solution, it's just a metal. 

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.133
But, at the surface of the metal
an electron could be 

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:04.900
transferred to RX. 

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.800
Now, where does that electron go
in the RX? 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.267
Ayesha, you got us on to this,
tell us again, what orbital 

00:08:12.267 --> 00:08:13.233
does it go into? 

00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:14.067
STUDENT: Sigma-star. 

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:15.667
PROFESSOR: And what does star
mean? 

00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:16.433
STUDENT: Antibonding. 

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:18.167
PROFESSOR: That it's
antibonding. 

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:19.733
So, what's, going to happen when
you put an 

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:23.367
electron and get RX-? 

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:26.300
It's also a radical, it's got an
odd number of electrons. 

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.700
What's the role of that last
electron? 

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:31.567
What does the star mean? 

00:08:31.567 --> 00:08:32.567
STUDENT: Antibonding. 

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:33.433
PROFESSOR: Antibonding. 

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:34.667
What happens? 

00:08:36.433 --> 00:08:38.500
We put electrons in the
antibonding orbital, 

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:39.267
what does it do? 

00:08:39.267 --> 00:08:40.000
STUDENT: Breaks. 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.500
PROFESSOR: Right, breaks the
bond. 

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.167
So, a pair will go there, and
now you got 

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:48.833
X- and the R radical. 

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:51.933
But, the R radical is generated
right next to the 

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:58.067
metal, so you can get a making
of a bond between that radical 

00:08:58.067 --> 00:08:59.900
and an atom in the metal. 

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.067
OK. 

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:06.167
So, you get an alkyl-metal bond
and X-. 

00:09:06.167 --> 00:09:12.133
This is shown as if the metal is
divalent, like zinc, so it 

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:15.500
makes a bond to R, and has a
positive charge, and then it's 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.400
associated with the X-. 

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.067
If it had been a monovalent
metal like lithium, then it 

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:25.667
wouldn't have had the charge, it
would be RLi, right. 

00:09:25.667 --> 00:09:27.967
Two lithium atoms would have
been involved. 

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:32.433
Another one would be Li+ that
goes with X-, but at any rate, 

00:09:32.433 --> 00:09:35.967
this is how you make alkyl-metal
bonds 

00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:37.200
in the first place. 

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:44.533
The next three slides suggest a
plausible mechanism for this 

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:47.667
formation of the cyclopropane,
but as we'll see, it's 

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:49.367
probably not correct. 

00:09:49.367 --> 00:09:53.167
But, let's just take this as an
opportunity to practice 

00:09:53.167 --> 00:09:56.667
figuring out how mechanisms
might work. 

00:09:56.667 --> 00:10:04.267
So, we could react zinc with
methyl chloride, and we get 

00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:06.867
this reaction that was shown on
the bottom of the previous 

00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:11.200
slide, a metal-zinc bond and
chloride, and I've shown it 

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.167
covalent between the chloride
and the zinc. We 

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:17.800
showed +/- last time. 

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.800
This we're going to use as a
model for the actual reaction, 

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.733
which had CH2I2 as the starting
material with zinc. 

00:10:26.733 --> 00:10:31.333
So, it gave I-Zn-CH2I, so we've
simplified it here so we 

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.967
can draw orbitals that are a
little simpler. 

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:39.967
That's the LUMO of that model
compound and mostly it's a 4s 

00:10:39.967 --> 00:10:43.367
orbital on the zinc, which is
antibonding to the things on 

00:10:43.367 --> 00:10:48.533
either side, which take away
part of it, because you have 

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.833
antibonding nodes there, of
course. 

00:10:50.833 --> 00:10:53.433
So, that's the LUMO. 

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:59.600
The HOMO is mostly a p orbital
on the zinc, 

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.433
actually the LUMO+1. 

00:11:02.433 --> 00:11:06.500
Now, if you bend the zinc,
you'll mix those 

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.800
two, they'll hybridize. 

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.567
So, if you bend it, that's the
4p on zinc, if you bend it, as 

00:11:13.567 --> 00:11:16.500
it's approaching the transition
state, where the 

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.833
zinc is going to be approaching
the C-C double 

00:11:18.833 --> 00:11:22.200
bond, then you hybridize that
central one and you've got an 

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.967
orbital that looks like this. 

00:11:23.967 --> 00:11:28.200
And, that's an sp hybrid, sp
something or other on the 

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:36.333
zinc. Notice that that's the
LUMO, so what's it well set up 

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:40.167
to do with respect to the
alkene? 

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:42.067
What could it overlap with? 

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:42.400
Amy? 

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.100
STUDENT: The sigma bond HOMO 

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.467
PROFESSOR: Sigma is down in the
middle of the carbons. 

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:51.200
STUDENT: Wouldn't the pi be
better? 

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.467
PROFESSOR: The pi is sticking up
where 

00:11:53.467 --> 00:11:55.400
you need it to overlap. 

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.067
So that can overlap with the
HOMO, and you're going to get 

00:11:58.067 --> 00:12:00.700
a pair of electrons that's
bonding between these two 

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.667
things, between the zinc and the
two carbons. 

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:07.367
But, this is again one of those
cases, so we have an 

00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:11.100
electrophile on top, a LUMO,
attacking an alkene, but we 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.200
can also look at the HOMO on
top, that's the electrons 

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.600
shifting into the bonding
region. 

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.867
We can also look at the HOMO on
top, and what does that 

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:25.100
look well set up to do? 

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.467
Matt, what do you say, with
respect to the alkene? 

00:12:29.467 --> 00:12:32.067
What orbital of the alkene could
that react with? 

00:12:32.067 --> 00:12:35.300
STUDENT: The double bond, I
guess. 

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.833
PROFESSOR: What about the double
bond? 

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:38.433
Which specific orbital of the
double bond? 

00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:39.667
STUDENT: The pi-star. 

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.967
PROFESSOR: pi-star, right, which
is the vacant orbital, 

00:12:41.967 --> 00:12:42.667
which is what you want. 

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:47.033
This a HOMO, the LUMO downstairs
is what we want 

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:49.800
there, and you see those are
well set up to react. 

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.767
We can do electron donation in
the other direction, top to 

00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:57.200
bottom, right, so were taking an
electron pair from top to 

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.567
bottom, also previous slide,
bottom to top, so we're 

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:02.567
forming two new bonds. 

00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:07.467
We can draw curved arrows, like
this and like that, and 

00:13:07.467 --> 00:13:11.367
what we've done now is form this
product where zinc is 

00:13:11.367 --> 00:13:13.767
added at one side and methyl at
the other. 

00:13:17.833 --> 00:13:21.533
Now, remember this we just drew
so the orbitals would 

00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:22.600
look simpler. 

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.867
If we had been using that thing
that had two iodines 

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:29.100
instead of one chlorine, then
the product would have been 

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:32.900
this, within the same reaction,
but that would have 

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.100
been the product. 

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.667
And now, what makes this
reactive? 

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.500
Can you see where there might be
a low LUMO in this? 

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.733
Any ideas? 

00:13:46.833 --> 00:13:47.267
Cassie? 

00:13:47.267 --> 00:13:49.567
STUDENT: The sigma-star orbital
of the C-l. 

00:13:49.567 --> 00:13:53.100
PROFESSOR: Sigma star in the
carbon-halogen bond. 

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.433
That would be a low LUMO. 

00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:59.133
How about the HOMO? 

00:13:59.133 --> 00:14:02.233
Where would be an unusually high
HOMO? 

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:08.467
Carbon with a halogen is
unusually low, what's the 

00:14:08.467 --> 00:14:10.767
analog that's unusually high? 

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.767
Carbon with what? 

00:14:11.767 --> 00:14:12.500
STUDENT: The zinc atom. 

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.067
PROFESSOR: With a metal is
unusually high. 

00:14:16.067 --> 00:14:19.267
So, the carbon-zinc bond would
be unusually high. 

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:25.967
Sigma Zn-C, and the LUMO is
sigma-star C-Cl. 

00:14:25.967 --> 00:14:29.600
I left one of the C's out. 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.867
Can you see what can happen? 

00:14:34.467 --> 00:14:38.467
So, you have a high HOMO
attacking a C-X bond, where 

00:14:38.467 --> 00:14:41.400
have we seen that before? 

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:47.200
What reaction has a high HOMO
attack sigma-star C-X, where X 

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.533
is a halogen? 

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:49.567
STUDENT: Borohydration. 

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:50.900
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.900
STUDENT: Borohydration. 

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.833
PROFESSOR: I can't hear you. 

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:55.133
STUDENT: Borohydration. 

00:14:55.133 --> 00:14:57.800
PROFESSOR: Hydroboration is such
a case and I'd have to 

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.233
think about why this is an
example. 

00:14:59.233 --> 00:15:01.967
I had it even simpler example in
mind. 

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:02.867
STUDENT: SN2. 

00:15:02.867 --> 00:15:06.700
PROFESSOR: SN2 right, a backside

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:08.233
attack by the high HOMO. 

00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:13.767
We can have the HOMO attack the
carbon, the iodide is the 

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:16.067
leaving group. 

00:15:16.067 --> 00:15:20.900
That then would form the
3-membered ring. 

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:24.667
So that's a very plausible
mechanism, it has two steps. 

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:31.533
First, you have the addition of
zinc halide and the carbon 

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:36.500
group, and then in a second
step, you do the SN2 type 

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.433
reaction to form the second
bond. 

00:15:39.433 --> 00:15:42.500
The first reaction formed the
bond on the right between the 

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:47.633
two CH2's and the second
reaction formed this one. 

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:50.100
But that probably is not the way
it goes. 

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.200
It's probably not two transition
states. 

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.333
We just guessed that. 

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:57.833
There was a quantum mechanical
calculation of what the 

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.467
transition state for this should
look like and they 

00:16:00.467 --> 00:16:02.700
found something different. 

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.600
Although that mechanism is
plausible, it probably occurs 

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.800
in a single step according to
this calculation, with this 

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.633
bent transition state. 

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:16.167
This is the transition state
where everything is happening 

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:18.767
at once, and let's look at what
that is. 

00:16:18.767 --> 00:16:21.800
First, we could look at how the
thing moves through the 

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:22.667
transition state. 

00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:25.367
You see, the carbons going
closer, the iodine is going 

00:16:25.367 --> 00:16:28.267
away from the carbon, and the
zinc going away. 

00:16:28.267 --> 00:16:29.033
Let's see what happens. 

00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:33.500
Notice incidentally that the CH2
group is like this, and is 

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.000
rocking in. 

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.300
Where have you seen that before?

00:16:39.733 --> 00:16:46.467
Where the CH2 group approaches
sideways and then rocks in? 

00:16:46.467 --> 00:16:48.400
Seen that before? 

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.700
Ellen? 

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.200
STUDENT: The carbene with
chlorines. 

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:55.500
PROFESSOR: A true carbene, CCl2
did exactly that in order 

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.633
to get the orbitals to match up.

00:16:57.633 --> 00:17:00.733
Let's look at the orbitals in
the transition state for this 

00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:05.000
on the way to making the
cyclopropane. 

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.300
This is at the transition-state
geometry. 

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.367
Here's the LUMO. 

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:13.867
What is that LUMO of the zinc
reagent? 

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.600
What would you call that
orbital? 

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.133
STUDENT: Sigma-star. 

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:24.367
PROFESSOR: Sigma-star between
zinc and the iodine. 

00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:30.400
That's the LUMO, and you can see
it's well set up to mix 

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.833
with the pi HOMO. 

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:35.733
At the same time, this is the
HOMO-2. 

00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:38.567
It's very near the HOMO, so a
very high-energy orbital. 

00:17:38.567 --> 00:17:40.567
What's that well set up to
overlap with? 

00:17:40.567 --> 00:17:44.400
Matt, you're our expert on this?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.500
What about the alkene is well
set up there? 

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:46.967
STUDENT: The pi-star. 

00:17:46.967 --> 00:17:48.567
PROFESSOR: pi-star, right. 

00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:51.567
Blue on the right, red on the
left. 

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:54.567
We can do both of them at once
and make the two new bonds and 

00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:56.733
break the others. 

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:00.333
Here's the next reaction we want
to talk about, which is 

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:03.333
an analogous reaction in the
sense of forming two bonds at 

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:07.133
once with a reaction between an
alkene and a 

00:18:07.133 --> 00:18:09.733
percarboxylic acid . 

00:18:09.733 --> 00:18:12.667
If we didn't have the red oxygen
there, if that hydrogen 

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:15.933
were directly attached to the
oxygen below, that group would 

00:18:15.933 --> 00:18:17.900
be a carboxylic acid. 

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.267
This is called the peracid, per-
means two oxygens linked 

00:18:23.267 --> 00:18:26.033
together, which is of course not
a very stable bond. 

00:18:26.033 --> 00:18:27.833
Do you remember why it's not so
stable to have two 

00:18:27.833 --> 00:18:29.067
oxygens in a row? 

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.367
Natalie? 

00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:35.867
STUDENT: Repulsion between the
electrons. 

00:18:35.867 --> 00:18:38.333
PROFESSOR: You have two pairs of
electrons that are 

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:42.667
repelling one another across the
bond. 

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:47.700
So, meta-chloroperbenzoic acid
is a commonly used reagent for 

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.500
this, and the product, you see,
gives the more stable carboxylic

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.900
acid, and oxygen attached to the
double bond. 

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.200
Our question is what the
mechanism is. 

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.600
It's also interesting to wonder
why you use 

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.167
meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid. 

00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:04.867
Why meta? 

00:19:04.867 --> 00:19:06.533
Why not para? 

00:19:06.533 --> 00:19:09.333
It just seems a weird choice. 

00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:12.700
It's interesting why it's
chosen. 

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:17.233
It's because it crystallizes
very easily, and the crystals 

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:20.000
of it are very stable, so it
could be stored for a very 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.400
long time without any
decomposition, even though 

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.867
essentially it's a rather
unstable compound. 

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.733
It's that practical application
that means that 

00:19:28.733 --> 00:19:32.700
this particular one is the one
that's often chosen, although 

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:36.800
others could be used as well,
other R groups on the peroxy 

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.700
acid functionality. 

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.067
OK, so you see in this
particular case which I took 

00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:47.667
as an example from the Jones
book, it was done at 25 

00:19:47.667 --> 00:19:51.300
degrees in benzene for five
hours and gave an 81% yield 

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:53.900
when R is n-hexyl, so it's a
pretty good reaction. 

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.067
So, to look at what the orbitals
are involved, let's 

00:19:59.067 --> 00:20:06.400
just make that R group instead
of meta-chlorobenzene, make it 

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.800
just the hydrogen, so this is
peroxyformic acid, where the 

00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.000
extra oxygen is obviously here.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.433
Had that hydrogen been here, it
would 

00:20:13.433 --> 00:20:16.633
have been formic acid. 

00:20:16.633 --> 00:20:21.233
Let's just distort that to the
geometry it has at the 

00:20:21.233 --> 00:20:23.467
transition state. 

00:20:23.467 --> 00:20:27.300
So you see the oxygen-oxygen
length increased a little bit, 

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:30.900
and the hydrogen bent up a bit.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.967
Now we'll rotate it, so to get
the idea of how we're going to 

00:20:33.967 --> 00:20:38.100
look at it and rotate it back a
bit. 

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.333
Now we're going to look at the
orbitals it has, it has a 

00:20:40.333 --> 00:20:43.833
bunch of occupied orbitals, of
course. 

00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:47.167
And, it has a bunch of
unoccupied orbitals. 

00:20:47.167 --> 00:20:50.933
But, we're particularly
interested in its LUMO. 

00:20:50.933 --> 00:20:53.500
What's the LUMO going to be? 

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.733
Elisa, what do you think? 

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.233
There're several possibilities,
so come 

00:21:02.233 --> 00:21:03.467
up with anything. 

00:21:10.867 --> 00:21:12.367
Anybody else got an idea, Karl?

00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:13.533
STUDENT: Sigma-star O-O. 

00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:17.367
PROFESSOR: Sigma-star O-O.
Remember, that's an oxygen, 

00:21:17.367 --> 00:21:20.400
big nuclear charge. 

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.833
Can you see any other thing that
might be a low LUMO? 

00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:23.200
Karl? 

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.867
STUDENT: Pi-star of C-O. 

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:27.100
PROFESSOR: Pi-star of C-O is
also low. 

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.367
So in principle, either of those
might be the reaction. 

00:21:32.367 --> 00:21:35.967
So, that's really the problem
often in choosing mechanisms, 

00:21:35.967 --> 00:21:38.100
that there's several
possibilities, and you have to 

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:40.900
consider them all, and if
they're two possibilities, and 

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:43.267
then at the next step two more,
and two more, it gets to 

00:21:43.267 --> 00:21:44.533
be a pretty big number. 

00:21:44.533 --> 00:21:47.000
But at any rate, those are the
two that you might consider at 

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.133
the beginning and once you've
tried these several paths, 

00:21:52.133 --> 00:21:54.733
then you can see which one's
going to give you the product 

00:21:54.733 --> 00:21:57.900
that you know by experiment is
actually the product, and it 

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:09.300
turns out to be this one,
sigma-star O-O. How about the 

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.000
LUMO of this thing? 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.767
Pardon me, that was the LUMO,
here's the HOMO, actually it's 

00:22:14.767 --> 00:22:18.833
not the HOMO, it's the HOMO-3,
but do you see 

00:22:18.833 --> 00:22:21.667
what it's made of? 

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:23.167
What's this big thing here? 

00:22:23.167 --> 00:22:24.900
STUDENT: Unshared pairs. 

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:28.333
PROFESSOR: That's the p orbital
on oxygen, the 

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:31.967
unshared pair, and it's mixed
with this up here, which 

00:22:31.967 --> 00:22:36.400
notice is three p orbitals in a
row. 

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:42.400
So that's a p orbital on this
oxygen and the pi electrons of 

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.233
the C-O double bond, mixing
together in a bonding way here 

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:47.833
but antibonding here. 

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:52.167
That's why had this been red and
that been blue, then this 

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:54.767
would have been a lower energy
orbital, so this is the 

00:22:54.767 --> 00:22:57.567
antibonding combination of those
two, and it 

00:22:57.567 --> 00:22:59.900
happens to be HOMO-3. 

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.767
So that's the HOMO that we're
going to be interested in. 

00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:07.700
So that's mostly, as we said,
the pi on that oxygen, the p 

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.533
orbital, and also pi-allyllic. 

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:14.567
Remember allyllic is three p
orbitals in a row all pointing 

00:23:14.567 --> 00:23:17.133
in the same direction so they
overlap side to side. 

00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:22.067
And there we've turned it a
little further just so you can 

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:24.667
see that it's those p orbitals.

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:27.033
Now we're going to look at it as
it interacts with the 

00:23:27.033 --> 00:23:29.967
carbon-carbon double bond. 

00:23:29.967 --> 00:23:33.067
The first interaction is going
to be that LUMO of the 

00:23:33.067 --> 00:23:35.600
oxygen-oxygen bond, sigma-star,
that's the 

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:40.867
electrophile, that's the LUMO,
and the high occupied orbital is

00:23:40.867 --> 00:23:47.167
going to be our old favorite, pi
of the double bond. 

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:48.067
We'll do this. 

00:23:48.067 --> 00:23:50.700
What does that reaction remind
you of a little bit, when 

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.433
something comes in from one
side, and the group leaves with

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:56.700
its electrons from the other
side? 

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:00.767
SN2 of course, so it's the same
kind of reaction. 

00:24:00.767 --> 00:24:05.767
So that's an SN2 attacking
oxygen, not carbon of course. 

00:24:05.767 --> 00:24:09.367
So, that's going to form a new
bond, and the leaving group, 

00:24:09.367 --> 00:24:11.200
notice, is a fairly good anion,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.467
carboxylate, better than RO-. 

00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:19.867
Now, what makes this reactive? 

00:24:19.867 --> 00:24:22.667
What could happen next? 

00:24:22.667 --> 00:24:22.900
Elisa? 

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.267
STUDENT: You have a positive
charge on the carbon. 

00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:27.600
PROFESSOR: We've got a positive
charge on carbon, so 

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.933
that's going to be a very low
energy orbital there. 

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:38.500
Where could be a HOMO that would
react with that? 

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.800
A high occupied orbital. 

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:43.067
Liang? 

00:24:43.067 --> 00:24:44.000
STUDENT: The lone pair on
oxygen. 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.200
PROFESSOR: OK, it could be. 

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.200
That wasn't what I expected you
to say, that's going to be 

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:51.000
what it is. 

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.533
What other possibility? 

00:24:52.533 --> 00:24:53.233
Liang? 

00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:57.000
[LAUGHTER] 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.300
Liang, what other possibility is
there when you look at this 

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.567
picture for a high HOMO? 

00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:12.167
STUDENT: The negative charge on
the-- 

00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:14.233
PROFESSOR: Right, we got a
negative charge up here. 

00:25:14.233 --> 00:25:17.500
This oxygen looks to me like it
has a higher HOMO 

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.233
than this one does. 

00:25:19.233 --> 00:25:22.067
What advantages does yours have
over the 

00:25:22.067 --> 00:25:23.033
one that's up there? 

00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:24.200
STUDENT: It's closer. 

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.200
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:25.967
STUDENT: It's closer. 

00:25:25.967 --> 00:25:29.000
PROFESSOR: It's closer, right. 

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.700
The electrophile is going to be
what Elisa said, the p 

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.167
orbital on the carbon plus. 

00:25:35.167 --> 00:25:38.800
But, the p orbital on the oxygen
is going to be the 

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.167
nucleophile, and it has the
advantage of being nearby. 

00:25:43.167 --> 00:25:49.133
So that means we can do this and
make a second bond, and of 

00:25:49.133 --> 00:25:50.933
course the plus charge will move
when 

00:25:50.933 --> 00:25:53.567
we share the electrons. 

00:25:53.567 --> 00:25:55.600
Now, what do we have for a LUMO
here? 

00:25:58.933 --> 00:26:00.500
If we're going to do another
reaction? 

00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.233
It's something to do with a
positive charge. 

00:26:08.233 --> 00:26:11.733
What particular orbital would
you point to, if we had to 

00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:14.467
choose a particular orbital? 

00:26:14.467 --> 00:26:16.967
The charge is not an orbital. 

00:26:16.967 --> 00:26:20.067
The charge makes an orbital low,
makes the electrons in an 

00:26:20.067 --> 00:26:22.233
orbital, low in energy nearby. 

00:26:22.233 --> 00:26:24.867
But, what orbital will we look
at? 

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:25.767
Jack, you got an idea? 

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:26.633
STUDENT: Pi. 

00:26:26.633 --> 00:26:27.933
PROFESSOR: Pardon me. 

00:26:27.933 --> 00:26:28.833
STUDENT: Pi. 

00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:29.467
PROFESSOR: I couldn't hear. 

00:26:29.467 --> 00:26:30.333
STUDENT: Pi. 

00:26:30.333 --> 00:26:31.500
PROFESSOR: Which pi? 

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.600
STUDENT: The one with oxygen. 

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.733
PROFESSOR: A p orbital on
oxygen? 

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.567
The p orbitals on oxygen are all
filled with electrons. 

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:45.167
We're looking for a vacant
orbital, right? 

00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:48.167
It's true that the unshared pair
on oxygen is lower in 

00:26:48.167 --> 00:26:50.833
energy than it would normally
be, but that 

00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.833
doesn't make it reactive. 

00:26:53.833 --> 00:26:56.900
For a pair of electrons to be
reactive they have to be high 

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.000
in energy, not low. 

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:02.033
We want some vacant orbital that
will be 

00:27:02.033 --> 00:27:04.333
unusually low in energy. 

00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:04.667
Chris? 

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:06.567
STUDENT: d orbital? 

00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:08.100
PROFESSOR: The d orbital? 

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.667
No, you know, if you get to
sulfur or something, if you 

00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:12.967
get down in the next row of the
periodic table, then there 

00:27:12.967 --> 00:27:17.233
are d orbitals that are vacant
in the valence shell, but on 

00:27:17.233 --> 00:27:20.033
oxygen d is way up in the next
shell. 

00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:21.033
STUDENT: Sigma-star. 

00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:22.367
PROFESSOR: Sigma-star. 

00:27:22.367 --> 00:27:23.167
STUDENT: of C-O? 

00:27:23.167 --> 00:27:27.000
PROFESSOR: It could be sigma
star C-O. Any other 

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.167
possibilities? 

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:31.367
It could be sigma-star C-O. Any
other possibilities? 

00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:33.167
STUDENT: Sigma-star O-H. 

00:27:33.167 --> 00:27:36.933
PROFESSOR: Sigma-star O-H.
Right. 

00:27:36.933 --> 00:27:39.467
That's the kind of thing you're
thinking of, because 

00:27:39.467 --> 00:27:45.067
when you have an O+ that's
protonated, three bonds, one 

00:27:45.067 --> 00:27:48.967
of them to a proton, what do you
think of happening? 

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:53.600
Losing a proton, right, and
that's that sigma-star O-H. So 

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.200
that's going to be our
electrophile, that's where the 

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.667
electrons are going to go, into
sigma-star O-H 

00:27:59.667 --> 00:28:00.900
and break that bond. 

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.033
Where they going to come from? 

00:28:02.033 --> 00:28:03.400
Where's the high HOMO? 

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.167
Liang, let's go back to you now.

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:06.167
STUDENT: Negative charge. 

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:08.267
PROFESSOR: Now you've got the
negative charge here. 

00:28:08.267 --> 00:28:09.933
But there's something
interesting about this 

00:28:09.933 --> 00:28:11.133
negative charge. 

00:28:11.133 --> 00:28:13.567
The reason that was a good place
to put a negative 

00:28:13.567 --> 00:28:16.767
charge, that carboxylate was a
good leaving group, was that 

00:28:16.767 --> 00:28:21.233
there was a carbonyl group, a
C-O double bond next door. 

00:28:21.233 --> 00:28:23.067
We can denote that-- 

00:28:23.067 --> 00:28:26.433
so we're going to have an SN2 at
H. We're going to attack, 

00:28:26.433 --> 00:28:31.533
and notice where we're going to
attack from, backside. 

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:33.867
These attacks are always
backside to break a 

00:28:33.867 --> 00:28:36.033
sigma-star. 

00:28:36.033 --> 00:28:41.367
Now, the trouble with this O- is
that it's not backside, 

00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:44.300
it's out in the front. 

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.667
Can you see how we could get it
into the back? 

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.100
How could we get this charge
back near here? 

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:59.133
One way that Karl suggests is
move the anion, it's not 

00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:01.000
bonded after all. 

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.400
But, there's a cleverer way to
do it. 

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.767
Not that you're not clever,
Karl. 

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.767
Watch this. 

00:29:13.367 --> 00:29:14.367
Does that suggest anything? 

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:17.100
That's why carboxylate is a good
leaving group, because 

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.800
it's resonance-stabilized. 

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:20.067
But, what does that suggest? 

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.533
Sebastian? 

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:30.600
You don't need to use this
anion, you can use this anion, 

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.833
because the charge is both
places here. 

00:29:33.833 --> 00:29:38.733
So we can draw that, put the
charge over there, and a 

00:29:38.733 --> 00:29:41.333
double bond here in front. 

00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:46.067
So now we've got it where it
needs to be. Now we can do the 

00:29:46.067 --> 00:29:49.000
backside attack, move the proton
over. 

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.067
We have those products, the
carboxylic acid without it's 

00:29:55.067 --> 00:29:59.033
oxygen, that extra oxygen that
the peracid had, and oxygen 

00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:01.967
added to the carbon-carbon
double bond to give a 

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:06.433
3-membered ring, an oxirane as
it's called, or an epoxide. 

00:30:09.167 --> 00:30:10.767
The interesting thing about
this-- 

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.833
Karl had the great idea, let's
just move it to 

00:30:15.833 --> 00:30:17.533
where it needs to be. 

00:30:17.533 --> 00:30:21.033
But there's a reason I didn't
want to move things. 

00:30:21.033 --> 00:30:26.900
The reason is, that in fact, all
those steps are not steps. 

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.000
They all happen at the same
time. 

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.667
So in fact when you start with
that material, and bring it up 

00:30:34.667 --> 00:30:37.567
to the carbon-carbon double
bond, all those 

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:38.833
things happen at once. 

00:30:41.433 --> 00:30:44.467
It made sense looking at them
one at a time, but in fact 

00:30:44.467 --> 00:30:47.733
they can all happen at the same
time. 

00:30:47.733 --> 00:30:50.067
So you have minimal atomic
displacement if you go 

00:30:50.067 --> 00:30:55.767
directly from this to transfer
the oxygen atom and get that. 

00:30:55.767 --> 00:30:58.333
But, they don't happen strictly
in parallel, just 

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:01.267
because they're all happening at
the same time, doesn't mean 

00:31:01.267 --> 00:31:04.100
that they're all half way done
at the same time. 

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.567
Some are a little leading, some
are a little trailing, 

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:08.500
but they're all happening
together with 

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.233
minimal atomic motion. 

00:31:10.233 --> 00:31:11.667
How do I know that? 

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:15.833
Because of this paper that was
published in JACS in 1991. 

00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:18.233
Now that's 20 years ago, and you
can do much better 

00:31:18.233 --> 00:31:20.000
calculations I'm sure now. 

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.567
But, this is when it was done
and published and it's 

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:23.467
believable. 

00:31:23.467 --> 00:31:26.400
This is what they calculated for
the geometry at the 

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.100
transition state, and they give
in every case what the 

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:36.367
length of that bond, and what
the bond angles are. 

00:31:36.367 --> 00:31:39.400
Notice that that O-O is strongly
stretched at the 

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.600
transition state, so it's really
broken a lot, putting 

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.667
the electrons in the anti-bond.

00:31:44.667 --> 00:31:50.033
It's started to break, it's
1.87, where normally it was 

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:53.200
1.5, roughly. 

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.067
Notice that the O-H bond,
remember that H is going to 

00:31:56.067 --> 00:32:00.267
transfer from O1 to O3, at the
transition state it is hardly 

00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:01.067
stretched at all. 

00:32:01.067 --> 00:32:05.200
It started at about one angstrom
and it's 1.01 here at 

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.700
the transition state. 

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:11.167
It actually is going to do most
of its motion after the 

00:32:11.167 --> 00:32:13.200
transition state. 

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.833
I put KH/KD is about one, that
is there's not a kinetic 

00:32:17.833 --> 00:32:19.600
isotope effect on this. 

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.267
Does that surprise you that
there's not a 

00:32:22.267 --> 00:32:23.500
kinetic isotope effect? 

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:26.900
That deuterium and hydrogen are

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.667
transferred at the same rate? 

00:32:31.267 --> 00:32:35.067
What does it tell you, when
there's a hydrogen isotope 

00:32:35.067 --> 00:32:38.167
effect, a hydrogen-deuterium
isotope effect? 

00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:40.600
What does that tell you about
the mechanism, about the 

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.500
transition state? 

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.500
STUDENT: That it's an
intermediate. 

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.533
PROFESSOR: No, it doesn't tell
you, it's an intermediate. 

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.433
STUDENT: That the deprotonation
is 

00:32:51.433 --> 00:32:52.833
the limiting step. 

00:32:52.833 --> 00:32:55.633
PROFESSOR: The rate limiting
step, the hydrogen is being 

00:32:55.633 --> 00:32:59.200
transferred, not before, not
after, but at the rate 

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.600
limiting step. 

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:03.567
But, in this case, the bond
isn't much stretched at the 

00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:07.967
transition state, so there's not
an isotope effect, because 

00:33:07.967 --> 00:33:12.800
most of the transfer of the
hydrogen is happening later. 

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.133
This shows the motion,
successive motions. 

00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:21.600
Here's the transition state,
then P1, P2 are subsequent 

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.500
stages on the reaction pathway.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.033
If you look at the motion of
each atom, you see the 

00:33:28.033 --> 00:33:30.833
hydrogen does most of its motion
from this oxygen to 

00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:35.467
this oxygen after the transition
state. 

00:33:35.467 --> 00:33:39.433
So, just because all these
things are coordinated, you 

00:33:39.433 --> 00:33:41.500
don't have distinct
intermediates, you have only 

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.400
one transition state, but they
don't all have to be 50% of 

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.267
the way from starting material
to product at 

00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:49.833
exactly the same instant. 

00:33:49.833 --> 00:33:52.300
You can see how the others are
moving as well. 

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.833
So, notice that after the
transition state, the 

00:33:57.833 --> 00:34:00.833
hydrogens are moving down a
little bit, the carbons are 

00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:03.533
moving up, the oxygen is moving
in here to make the new 

00:34:03.533 --> 00:34:06.633
bond, and so on, and the
hydrogen is moving away. 

00:34:06.633 --> 00:34:11.467
This thing, the carboxylate at
the top is rocking away, 

00:34:11.467 --> 00:34:14.033
breaking the oxygen-oxygen bond
here, and 

00:34:14.033 --> 00:34:17.933
forming the OH bond here. 

00:34:17.933 --> 00:34:20.567
There's only one transition
state, this is said to be 

00:34:20.567 --> 00:34:23.833
concerted in the sense things
are happening at the same 

00:34:23.833 --> 00:34:26.900
time, not several distinct
intermediates. 

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.733
But it's not synchronous, it's
not all 

00:34:28.733 --> 00:34:30.433
happening exactly in parallel. 

00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:37.100
The name of this transition
state, they called it spiro 

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.600
transition state. 

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.933
Spiro means two perpendicular
rings sharing a common atom. 

00:34:43.933 --> 00:34:47.733
Here it's O1, here's this
five-membered ring here, and a 

00:34:47.733 --> 00:34:50.733
three-membered ring here, but
they're perpendicular to one 

00:34:50.733 --> 00:34:52.400
another, they share an atom. 

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:56.367
That's what spiro means, to have
two rings that are spiro, 

00:34:56.367 --> 00:34:59.967
they share an atom and are
perpendicular to one another. 

00:34:59.967 --> 00:35:03.667
But, in fact, a very similar
mechanism, in fact arguably 

00:35:03.667 --> 00:35:06.833
the same mechanism, was proposed
by Professor 

00:35:06.833 --> 00:35:11.067
Bartlett, your grandfather, in
1950. 

00:35:11.067 --> 00:35:14.767
This was before people thought
so much about spiro and about 

00:35:14.767 --> 00:35:17.400
the arrangement in space of
orbitals as they do now. 

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.500
In fact, they didn't think about
orbitals at 

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.633
all really in 1950. 

00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:26.567
So, in a paper in 1950, he drew
this structure, which 

00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:30.067
shows the peroxycarboxylic acid
twisted around, so the 

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:34.067
hydrogen can make it from here
to here, and the oxygen then 

00:35:34.067 --> 00:35:35.467
be transferred to that. 

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:39.300
So this picture is taken from
that publication in 1950. 

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.633
You'll notice that the arrows
were not at all carefully 

00:35:42.633 --> 00:35:46.267
drawn, and it's not clear what
they mean. 

00:35:46.267 --> 00:35:50.600
This hydrogen in fact started
attached to this oxygen, and 

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:54.033
is now moved over to this oxygen
in the product, so I 

00:35:54.033 --> 00:35:56.300
have no idea really what that
arrow meant. 

00:35:59.733 --> 00:36:02.367
But, that was old days, right,
before people talked about 

00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:05.467
orbitals and so on, 60 years
ago. 

00:36:05.467 --> 00:36:08.833
The problem is, how about now,
how carefully do people draw 

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:10.267
such things now? 

00:36:10.267 --> 00:36:13.367
Well, we could look at a modern
textbook that has a 

00:36:13.367 --> 00:36:16.233
drawing of this particular
reaction, and 

00:36:16.233 --> 00:36:17.967
draws it in that way. 

00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:21.367
What I'd like you to think of
for a problem is, compare the 

00:36:21.367 --> 00:36:24.667
arrows in this textbook
illustration, with the ones 

00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:27.200
that we developed in the
previous frame to show where 

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.467
HOMOs and LUMOs were
interacting, and how electron 

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:33.233
pairs were shifting, and see if
you can draw your own 

00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:36.767
diagram that's more accurate
than this textbook one is. 

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:45.633
Stereospecificity of this
epoxidation, if the oxygen is 

00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:49.267
really being transferred this
way, all at once, the two new 

00:36:49.267 --> 00:36:53.867
bonds have to be on the same
face of the double bond. 

00:36:53.867 --> 00:36:59.100
So, if you started with
trans-2-butene and used this 

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.433
meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, and
this is a specific example 

00:37:03.433 --> 00:37:06.067
done in this solvent, dioxane,
at 0 

00:37:06.067 --> 00:37:08.033
degrees for 10 hours. 

00:37:08.033 --> 00:37:12.367
Notice that these two methyl
groups are on opposite sides 

00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:15.867
of the 3-membered ring, just as
they were on opposite sides 

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.967
of the pi bond here. 

00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:23.967
This happens with 52% to 60%
percent yield, but more 

00:37:23.967 --> 00:37:31.467
significant, is that it's
greater than 99.5% trans. 

00:37:31.467 --> 00:37:34.733
This is an actual 52% to 60%
yield, that's what they 

00:37:34.733 --> 00:37:38.400
actually got of pure stuff and
put it in the bottle. 

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.967
And you know, that if you have
to distill stuff at the end 

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:47.100
and so on, you don't always get
100%. 

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:51.333
If all they had said, was that a
60% yield, you'd worry, what's 

00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:53.167
that other 40%? 

00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:56.500
Could it be the cis isomer? 

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.300
In fact, that's not what it was,
because they tested and 

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:04.300
found that there was no cis
there, it was more than 99.5, 

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.267
the limits of their detection
was trans, so it's a concerted 

00:38:08.267 --> 00:38:11.767
syn addition, both new bonds
from the 

00:38:11.767 --> 00:38:15.100
same face of the alkene. 

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.133
And, you'd worry about this
also, that this is the more 

00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:20.933
stable isomer, where the methyls
aren't running into 

00:38:20.933 --> 00:38:21.767
one another. 

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:24.967
Maybe it wasn't specific, but
you just got the one that was 

00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:26.567
most stable. 

00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:29.733
So, of course what they did is
do the cis one as well, and 

00:38:29.733 --> 00:38:34.867
that's also greater than 99.5%,
cis now, not trans. 

00:38:34.867 --> 00:38:37.167
It's clear that the reaction is
stereospecific. 

00:38:40.767 --> 00:38:45.167
They did that in order to
prepare those epoxides for 

00:38:45.167 --> 00:38:46.233
another purpose. 

00:38:46.233 --> 00:38:49.233
It'd been prepared before, in
1936, by 

00:38:49.233 --> 00:38:52.600
an alternative mechanism. 

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.233
It was two steps to do it, so it
was a 

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:57.100
harder way to make it. 

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:59.033
They started with the reagent
HOCl, hypochlorous acid. 

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.367
How do you think HOCl will
react? 

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.833
Any ideas? 

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:15.267
What other reagent that we've
talked about reacting does 

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:17.433
that remind you of? 

00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:21.767
This is a chlorine, with an
electronegative bond to it, 

00:39:21.767 --> 00:39:23.067
bond to oxygen. 

00:39:23.067 --> 00:39:27.400
What's the LUMO of that, do you
think? 

00:39:36.667 --> 00:39:37.100
Cassie? 

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:38.067
STUDENT: The O-Cl sigma-star. 

00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:43.267
PROFESSOR: Right, O-Cl
sigma-star, the same as Cl-Cl 

00:39:43.267 --> 00:39:44.967
sigma-star. 

00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:47.733
What kind of thing happens with
Cl-Cl sigma-star 

00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:51.200
remember, if you react it with
an alkene? 

00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:58.300
It forms a halonium ion, like
that. 

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.233
The only difference is that in
that case, it was Cl- that's 

00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:06.033
leaving, in this case it's OH-
that's leaving. 

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:09.267
But, that's drawn in brackets
because it's just an 

00:40:09.267 --> 00:40:11.667
intermediate, it's not something
that you isolate, 

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:14.300
it's very reactive. 

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.633
Remember you made hydroxide, so
what's going to be the next 

00:40:17.633 --> 00:40:18.800
stage of the reaction. 

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:22.033
How will this react with
hydroxide? 

00:40:22.033 --> 00:40:24.033
How does the one that had a
chlorine on 

00:40:24.033 --> 00:40:25.333
it react with chlorine? 

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:32.067
It's an SN2 kind of reaction. 

00:40:32.067 --> 00:40:35.000
In fact, you have water here
that can also do it. 

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.967
It gives a 55% yield after
distillation of this stuff, 

00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:42.367
where you notice what happened
was the oxygen attacked 

00:40:42.367 --> 00:40:45.867
backside, opened this ring. 

00:40:45.867 --> 00:40:50.333
So this methyl group is back,
and this methyl group is back, 

00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:53.067
since we started with cis. 

00:40:53.067 --> 00:40:55.633
We've got correlated
configurations 

00:40:55.633 --> 00:40:57.033
at these two carbons. 

00:40:57.033 --> 00:40:59.767
Notice it would have been just
as easy for the oxygen to 

00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:03.000
attack this carbon, it attacked
this one, it could 

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.367
have attacked this one. 

00:41:05.367 --> 00:41:08.833
So it came this way, it could
have come this way. 

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:11.367
What's the relationship between
the two products you 

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:12.900
would get if you did those two
reactions? 

00:41:20.867 --> 00:41:21.133
Ellen? 

00:41:21.133 --> 00:41:21.833
STUDENT: Enantiomers. 

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:23.900
PROFESSOR: They're enantiomers.

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.033
So you get not just this
compound, but also it's 

00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:29.400
enantiomer. 

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:32.767
But, you don't get ones where
this methyl would be in front 

00:41:32.767 --> 00:41:35.900
of the hydrogen in back, as
shown there. 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.333
There are four diastereomers,
you only get two of them, you 

00:41:39.333 --> 00:41:42.367
get the two enantiomers. 

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:45.233
So that's the first reaction,
they did it, they got a 55% 

00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.000
yield after distillation. 

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.100
Then they reacted it with KOH,
notice it's 20 M KOH, pretty 

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.067
strong solution at 90 degrees,
that's vigorous conditions, in 

00:41:56.067 --> 00:41:57.867
water for two hours. 

00:41:57.867 --> 00:42:01.700
How do you think OH- will react
with this stuff? 

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:05.267
I want several possibilities. 

00:42:05.267 --> 00:42:10.033
What could OH- attack in this
molecule? 

00:42:10.033 --> 00:42:10.500
Chris? 

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.500
STUDENT: Deprotonate the
hydrogen. 

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:13.667
PROFESSOR: Deprotonate the
hydrogen. 

00:42:13.667 --> 00:42:15.333
What would have been another
possibility? 

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:16.633
STUDENT: Attack the chlorine. 

00:42:16.633 --> 00:42:18.800
PROFESSOR: It could've
attacked-- 

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.333
done an SN2 here on the other
one, but it's 

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:23.833
a little bit hindered. 

00:42:23.833 --> 00:42:28.067
Generally proton transfers are
pretty fast, so you were right 

00:42:28.067 --> 00:42:29.200
the first time. 

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:33.167
The KOH takes off that and
generates that anion. 

00:42:33.167 --> 00:42:36.167
Now again, I've drawn that in
brackets because it's just an 

00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:37.400
intermediate. 

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:38.633
What does it do? 

00:42:41.033 --> 00:42:45.067
What does this O- do? 

00:42:45.067 --> 00:42:46.333
Chris, you just told me. 

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.167
What can it attack? 

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:54.567
STUDENT: The lone pair on the
oxygen. 

00:42:54.567 --> 00:42:58.967
PROFESSOR: It is the lone pair
on the oxygen, that's the high 

00:42:58.967 --> 00:43:00.667
HOMO, what's the low LUMO? 

00:43:00.667 --> 00:43:04.933
STUDENT: The sigma-star
carbon... 

00:43:04.933 --> 00:43:07.767
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sigma-star
carbon-chlorine. 

00:43:07.767 --> 00:43:09.767
What would you call that kind of
reaction, ever see a 

00:43:09.767 --> 00:43:13.267
reaction like that before, where
O- attacks carbon and 

00:43:13.267 --> 00:43:14.533
chloride leaves? 

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.667
Noelle, did you ever see a
reaction like that? 

00:43:19.667 --> 00:43:21.700
STUDENT: SN2. 

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.400
PROFESSOR: Can't hear. 

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.400
STUDENT: SN2. 

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.700
PROFESSOR: It's SN2, right, and
it's helped out because 

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.867
this is held very close to where
it needs to 

00:43:27.867 --> 00:43:29.567
be to do the reaction. 

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:32.133
OK, so we do that. 

00:43:32.133 --> 00:43:34.733
Now, we form the epoxide. 

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:40.700
Notice the stereochemistry of
this is interesting. 

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:45.000
The two carbons are on the same
side of the ring, the 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
same way they were on the same
side of the pi bond here. 

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.133
But, the stereochemistry
happened in sort of an 

00:43:52.133 --> 00:43:53.967
interesting way. 

00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:56.333
This is a 90% yield that they
got in this 

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.800
in the second step. 

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.767
But, since they had to do two
reactions from the starting 

00:44:00.767 --> 00:44:04.900
material, the overall yield was
only 45% from the original 

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:06.400
starting material. 

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.867
Do you remember what it was when
they used 

00:44:08.867 --> 00:44:13.667
meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in
the previous example to 

00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:16.667
make the same substance from the
same starting material? 

00:44:16.667 --> 00:44:17.833
You remember what the yield was?

00:44:17.833 --> 00:44:18.767
STUDENT: 60% 

00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:21.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it was 60%. 

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.967
So nearly half again as much, at
least a third again as 

00:44:23.967 --> 00:44:26.700
much, and in just one reaction,
you didn't have to 

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.700
do this distillation and so on,
so it was much more 

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.933
convenient. 

00:44:29.933 --> 00:44:33.567
That one, the oxygen just went
straight on, and 

00:44:33.567 --> 00:44:34.933
it was a syn addition. 

00:44:34.933 --> 00:44:37.867
This one happens in an
interesting way. 

00:44:37.867 --> 00:44:41.667
First, it's a syn addition of
the Cl+, both from the same 

00:44:41.667 --> 00:44:45.567
side, but then there's this SN2
kind of reaction, and it's 

00:44:45.567 --> 00:44:48.267
an inversion at this carbon. 

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:54.000
And, then here, there's an
inversion at that carbon. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.800
So overall, it's still a syn
addition, but by two 

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.467
inversions. 

00:45:00.467 --> 00:45:02.400
So, that's interesting. 

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.900
This is somewhat reminiscent of
what we talked about last 

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.700
semester, which is the Sharpless
asymmetric 

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.400
epoxidation. 

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.367
I'll just run through this
quickly, we've done it several 

00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:13.300
times before. 

00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:18.267
So, you lose the RO-, then a
peroxy group comes up to the 

00:45:18.267 --> 00:45:23.433
titanium. We get that
intermediate and react it 

00:45:23.433 --> 00:45:25.467
with allyl alcohol. 

00:45:25.467 --> 00:45:31.900
The OH of the allyl alcohol
replaces the RO, it replaces 

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:32.933
there, to get this. 

00:45:32.933 --> 00:45:37.200
And, now this double bond is
being held near this oxygen. 

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:40.033
The LUMO is the sigma-star up
there, the same thing we've 

00:45:40.033 --> 00:45:44.667
been talking about, and the HOMO
is pi. 

00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:46.900
So, we've made a bond. 

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:50.900
In fact, this pair of electrons
probably then makes 

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:54.100
a bond between oxygen and this
titanium, rather than the RO 

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.633
going away. 

00:45:55.633 --> 00:45:58.933
But, at the same time, there's
also the p on the oxygen 

00:45:58.933 --> 00:46:03.400
attacking pi-star of C-C. This
is exactly the same thing we 

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.833
just saw a few slides ago with
peroxy benzoic acid. 

00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:12.767
We make two bonds, and put the
oxygen on from the same face. 

00:46:12.767 --> 00:46:16.800
This particular arrangement
makes the R configuration at 

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.733
this tetrahedral carbon. 

00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:24.100
If we wanted to get the other
one, we'd have to rotate this 

00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.033
bond to be in front, and this to
be in back, so that we 

00:46:27.033 --> 00:46:31.567
could attack the other face,
rotate it back like that. 

00:46:31.567 --> 00:46:34.767
You'll notice that if you do
that, those two groups in 

00:46:34.767 --> 00:46:38.733
front are big, and they would
run into one another. 

00:46:38.733 --> 00:46:41.200
So you don't do that, you do the
other one, and it gives us 

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.233
a specific enantiomer of the
epoxide. 

00:46:44.233 --> 00:46:46.367
But the relevance at this
stage-- 

00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:49.300
that we talked about last
semester, the relevance at 

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.733
this stage is that it's
essentially the same mechanism 

00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:55.400
that's involved in the
peroxybenzoic acid of the 

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.400
electrons forming the two new
bonds. 

00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:04.100
That was a chiral oxidizing
agent. 

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.267
Now, this is a big time-- 

00:47:06.267 --> 00:47:09.933
making epoxides from alkenes is
really a big time 

00:47:09.933 --> 00:47:12.067
operation, as is shown here. 

00:47:12.067 --> 00:47:15.733
This is done with silver
catalysis at 15 atmospheres of 

00:47:15.733 --> 00:47:19.333
pressure and 250 degrees
Celsius. 

00:47:19.333 --> 00:47:22.933
Notice that the source of oxygen
is O2 in this case, 

00:47:22.933 --> 00:47:25.600
that's a really cheap source of
oxygen. 

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.167
In fact, they do use O2. 

00:47:27.167 --> 00:47:31.000
There are other people who do
the same kind of thing who use 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.900
air, but it turns out to be
worthwhile to use O2 rather 

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.667
than air, because you get a
higher yield. 

00:47:37.667 --> 00:47:41.700
So what you get is an oxygen
that's transferred like that, 

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.733
that's called ethylene oxide. 

00:47:44.733 --> 00:47:51.033
That process generates 20
million tons a year, worth 20 

00:47:51.033 --> 00:47:54.700
billion dollars, of making
ethylene oxide. 

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.333
Just to give you an idea, here's
an aerial view of New 

00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:59.967
Haven, and down here is where
most of you 

00:47:59.967 --> 00:48:02.700
live on the old campus. 

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.767
If you had a bucket that would
hold that much ethylene oxide 

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:08.800
as a liquid, it's a gas, but if
you condensed it, it would 

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.367
be a liquid. 

00:48:09.367 --> 00:48:11.500
That's how big the bucket would
be. 

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.867
[LAUGHTER] 

00:48:13.867 --> 00:48:17.800
I think it's 15 times as high as
Harkness Tower and covering 

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.100
the entire old campus. 

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.833
So, that's a lot of material. 

00:48:21.833 --> 00:48:29.833
Now that reaction gives 84%
yield, the rest oxidizes, the 

00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:34.333
rest of the original ethylene
oxidizes to CO2 and H2O. 

00:48:34.333 --> 00:48:36.433
Suppose you could adjust the
conditions to 

00:48:36.433 --> 00:48:38.600
make the yield higher. 

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:42.867
Suppose instead of 84%, you
could increase it by 5%. 

00:48:42.867 --> 00:48:46.167
If you could raise the yield by
5%, that would be worth 

00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:49.267
more than a billion dollars a
year. 

00:48:49.267 --> 00:48:51.933
So, here's a way for you to make
your fortune. 

00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:55.267
Although, I will caution you
that people have worked on 

00:48:55.267 --> 00:48:59.000
this a lot to try to get every
last percentage out of it. 

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:07.533
In fact, why make 20 million
tons of ethylene oxide? 

00:49:07.533 --> 00:49:12.767
Only 0.05% of it is used as
ethylene oxide. 

00:49:12.767 --> 00:49:18.133
It's a disinfectant that's used
in some applications, 

00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:20.100
it's a gas, and you can put it
in to 

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:22.167
kill microbes or something. 

00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:24.467
But, very, very little of it is
used for. 

00:49:24.467 --> 00:49:26.733
What do they use it for? 

00:49:26.733 --> 00:49:31.967
2/3 of it is used to make that
compound, just add water in 

00:49:31.967 --> 00:49:35.167
the reaction that we were just
talking about, 

00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:36.633
to make that compound. 

00:49:36.633 --> 00:49:38.500
Does anybody know what that
compound is called? 

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:39.767
You could call it
dihydroxyethane. 

00:49:42.733 --> 00:49:46.167
But, it has a more common name.

00:49:46.167 --> 00:49:48.767
It's called ethylene glycol. 

00:49:48.767 --> 00:49:49.767
It's antifreeze. 

00:49:49.767 --> 00:49:52.533
So, a lot of it is used for
antifreeze, but it's also used 

00:49:52.533 --> 00:49:53.500
it for solvent. 

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:59.833
Also it's incorporated in
polymers, the polyethylene 

00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:02.833
terephthalate, the stuff that
makes soft drink 

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.300
bottles, for example. 

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.967
It's used in making that. 

00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:08.600
Glycol is an interesting word. 

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:14.167
The gly- is from Greek root that
means sweet, like 

00:50:14.167 --> 00:50:17.233
glucose, it's the same root. 

00:50:17.233 --> 00:50:20.867
It's because ethylene glycol
tastes sweet, although we 

00:50:20.867 --> 00:50:24.733
don't taste it because it's
poisonous, but the original 

00:50:24.733 --> 00:50:26.533
people did, so that's why it's
called glycol. 

00:50:29.767 --> 00:50:34.767
That reaction, to change
ethylene oxide into ethylene 

00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:39.567
glycol, occurs either with base
catalysis or acid 

00:50:39.567 --> 00:50:45.367
catalysis, so since the focus of
this lecture has been-- 

00:50:45.367 --> 00:50:49.233
woops, this lecture is over. 

00:50:49.233 --> 00:50:51.000
Sorry, I got carried away. 

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.067
We'll talk about the mechanisms
next time. 

00:50:53.067 --> 00:50:54.333
Thanks.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.140
Prof: Okay,
well let's begin.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.286
And, as you know,
in our class one of the topics,

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:13.433
or themes, that we're
considering is intellectual

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:14.470
history.
 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.207
And lurking in the background,
of course, is the big question

00:00:19.207 --> 00:00:22.050
of medicine itself and what it
is.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.470
What is medical science?
 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.260
What does it mean to have a
medical science?

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.180
Well, this morning we'll be
considering that.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:40.143
Is medical science purely the
technical application of neutral

00:00:40.143 --> 00:00:41.710
knowledge?
 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.690
Or should we think of it as a
cultural institution,

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.890
also, built by dominant social
groups in society,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.760
that in some way may reflect
their worldview,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.230
sometimes may embody their
prejudices,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.048
and may promote their interests?
 

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:07.338
And at least we should ask the
question, if we accept the

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:11.858
biomedical paradigm of disease,
what are the implications of

00:01:11.858 --> 00:01:13.390
that acceptance?
 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.030
What are the costs?
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.280
What are we giving up?
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.099
So, that's the big issue.
 

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:26.563
And today what I'd like to do
is to look at a subset of the

00:01:26.563 --> 00:01:30.364
bigger problem,
and this is the medical

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:36.040
specialization that's known as
"tropical medicine."

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.545
It emerged in the 1890s,
in a period,

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:48.303
that is, of--it gained rapidly
enormous prestige and influence,

00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:54.060
and is still a major subfield
in medicine.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.852
The discipline thus far has
undergone three periods in its

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:00.870
history.
 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.661
The first is the one that we're
going to be concentrating on

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:08.177
this morning,
and that's the period from

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:13.729
roughly the 1890s until more or
less the First World War.

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:18.310
That marks the real heyday of
tropical medicine,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.520
the time when it was the
cutting edge of medical science,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.688
when it made a series of major
discoveries,

00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:32.430
and served the most obvious
political purposes.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.560
It was followed in its history
by a second period,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.818
that lasts more or less from
World War I until the 1970s,

00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:47.520
the next half-century of
tropical medicine.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.577
And during this period the
discipline loses a lot of its

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:54.598
scientific momentum.
 

00:02:54.598 --> 00:03:00.231
Tropical medicine came to be
confined essentially to

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:03.746
parasitology,
and at this period,

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:09.258
the dynamism in medical science
moved instead to microbiology

00:03:09.258 --> 00:03:12.658
and such offshoots as
immunology,

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:18.485
and that boosted such major
developments as antibiotics and

00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:24.009
a series of effective vaccines,
and that attracted the lion's

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.830
share of research funds.
 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.849
So, tropical medicine,
in the period from the First

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.770
World War to the 1970s,
made relatively few major,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.979
major discoveries.
 

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:43.818
Then, after World War II,
and accelerating from the

00:03:43.818 --> 00:03:46.995
1970s,
we see a third phase,

00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:52.258
ushered in by such things as
decolonization and a new

00:03:52.258 --> 00:03:57.318
attention to public health in
the Third World,

00:03:57.318 --> 00:04:02.486
and with it a new influx of
research funds through the World

00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:08.092
Health Organization and powerful
foundations like the Rockefeller

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:10.718
and MacArthur Foundations.
 

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:15.413
Well, what I want to do this
morning is to look critically at

00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:16.980
tropical medicine.
 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.050
And by that I don't mean for or
against.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.178
What I want to do instead is to
look at why it arose as a

00:04:26.178 --> 00:04:28.470
discipline when it did.
 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.689
What interests did it serve?
 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.420
What were its implications?
 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.639
And I'm going to argue that
tropical medicine,

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:42.382
and particularly in this
formative early period before

00:04:42.382 --> 00:04:46.694
the First World War,
was clearly socially

00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:48.160
constructed.
 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.375
This is a period that coincides
with the high tide of colonial

00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:57.480
expansion, the age of the
scramble for Africa.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.048
And tropical medicine gave
expression to an imperial view

00:05:03.048 --> 00:05:07.069
of the world,
and it marked the relationship,

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.293
in medical terms,
between Western Europe,

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:13.995
on the one hand,
and Asia and Africa on the

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:19.050
other, and between the United
States and Latin America.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.029
As a discipline,
it served as a major instrument

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.798
also in promoting European
expansion overseas,

00:05:28.798 --> 00:05:33.250
and American hegemony in the
Americas.

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.786
In its applications,
and in the policies it

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:42.259
promoted, tropical medicine was
not only value-neutral science;

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.672
it was also an instrument of
power, and we need to bear that

00:05:47.672 --> 00:05:48.589
in mind.
 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:54.550
Now, the emergence of tropical
medicine marked a transition,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.269
a transformation,
from something that had

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.915
preceded it,
and that I hope won't be

00:05:59.915 --> 00:06:00.660
confusing.
 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.000
But from the middle of the
eighteenth century,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.326
more or less,
until the closing decade of the

00:06:08.326 --> 00:06:12.547
nineteenth century,
there had been an older

00:06:12.547 --> 00:06:17.019
tradition that can be summarized
under the label of

00:06:17.019 --> 00:06:20.509
"diseases of the
tropics."

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:24.951
And there were a couple of
classic statements of this older

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:25.870
tradition.
 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.290
One was a work,
an important work,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.716
by James Lind,
an eighteenth-century

00:06:32.716 --> 00:06:36.918
physician,
who wrote "An Essay on

00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:42.036
Diseases Incidental to Europeans
in Hot Climates,"

00:06:42.036 --> 00:06:47.247
and this was built on the
experience of Europeans in the

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:48.860
West Indies.
 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.422
And then there was another work
by James Johnson called

00:06:53.422 --> 00:06:57.730
"The Influence of Tropical
Climates on European

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.617
Constitutions,"
built on the experience of

00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:03.730
Europeans in India.
 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.129
What these works,
and other ones of their kind,

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:12.141
meant in the expression
"diseases of the

00:07:12.141 --> 00:07:15.879
tropics"
was something particular.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.329
They meant that in the colonial
world--

00:07:18.329 --> 00:07:22.069
in, that is,
the area of hot climate,

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.942
as it was expressed at the
time--Europeans were subject to

00:07:26.942 --> 00:07:32.384
special diseases as challenges,
that arose as a result of

00:07:32.384 --> 00:07:36.339
conditions peculiar to warm
climates,

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.110
and to the resulting conditions
of temperature,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:43.569
humidity and local ecology.
 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:48.392
Under those conditions,
the diseases that would afflict

00:07:48.392 --> 00:07:52.591
Europeans were not,
however, different in nature

00:07:52.591 --> 00:07:55.449
from those familiar at home.
 

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:58.605
The diseases of hot countries
were heightened in their

00:07:58.605 --> 00:08:02.281
virulence,
perhaps, and the constitutions

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:07.603
of white people were now
subjected to new and unfamiliar

00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:12.730
stresses that made them
peculiarly vulnerable in these

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.149
climates to disease.
 

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:20.834
But the issue was simply--in
the era, should we say,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:26.629
of diseases of the tropics--was
simply one of degree,

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:28.970
rather than kind.
 

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:34.543
The diseases of the tropics
were simply intense variants of

00:08:34.543 --> 00:08:37.330
familiar disease processes.
 

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:41.120
And there was an educational
corollary to that,

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.658
which was that physicians who
had studied general medicine,

00:08:46.658 --> 00:08:51.921
in European medical schools,
were fully equipped to treat

00:08:51.921 --> 00:08:57.840
the entire spectrum of human
diseases wherever they occurred.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.370
Diseases of the tropics weren't
a special category.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:08.190
They were simply heightened
versions of familiar maladies.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:12.302
In other words,
the concept of diseases of the

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:17.149
tropics presupposed a
universality of a single medical

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:22.268
discipline that viewed the
diseases of the tropical world

00:09:22.268 --> 00:09:28.649
as posing problems of degree,
but not of a thoroughly

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:30.798
different kind.
 

00:09:30.798 --> 00:09:35.725
We should also say that this
idea of diseases of the tropics

00:09:35.725 --> 00:09:40.649
already did have embodied in it
some troubling and important

00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:45.826
questions that had to do with a
colonial or imperial and racial

00:09:45.826 --> 00:09:47.830
view of the world.
 

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:51.673
European bodies,
the concept presupposed,

00:09:51.673 --> 00:09:57.730
were different in some way from
those of Asians and Africans.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:02.823
They weren't intended for the
conditions prevailing in the

00:10:02.823 --> 00:10:08.008
colonies, and so the question
was, were the tropics in fact

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:10.690
inhabitable for Europeans?
 

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.687
You can see this in expressions
like "darkest Africa,"

00:10:15.687 --> 00:10:19.606
"teeming Asia"--
those imply dangerous

00:10:19.606 --> 00:10:23.971
places--and even more the
expression of "the white

00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:25.668
man's grave."
 

00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:29.522
And, so, the question was
whether settling in the tropics

00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:31.379
was going to be possible.
 

00:10:31.379 --> 00:10:35.250
Was it simply that Europeans
needed a period of seasoning--

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.860
another term of the time--or
acclimatization,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.187
after which they'd be
stress-hardy and able to survive

00:10:45.187 --> 00:10:47.600
in these new settings?
 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.014
Physicians who dealt with
diseases of the tropics thought

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:56.428
of themselves as performing an
indispensable service,

00:10:56.428 --> 00:11:00.330
one that was useful to European
states,

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.308
and especially to explorers,
travelers,

00:11:04.308 --> 00:11:07.769
settlers, colonial
administrators,

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:11.649
and of course sailors and
soldiers.

00:11:11.649 --> 00:11:16.860
The service was to provide
assistance and advice during the

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.724
time of acclimatization,
advice on exercise,

00:11:20.724 --> 00:11:25.928
diet, clothing and housing;
in short, everything that new

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:30.851
arrivals would need to protect
themselves from the rigors of

00:11:30.851 --> 00:11:32.769
the new environment.
 

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:37.261
But the 1890s marked a
transition to something

00:11:37.261 --> 00:11:41.277
different--
from this view of diseases of

00:11:41.277 --> 00:11:45.235
the tropics,
to something that sounds subtly

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:48.283
different,
but was profoundly so,

00:11:48.283 --> 00:11:53.158
and that is tropical diseases
and tropical medicine.

00:11:53.158 --> 00:11:59.950
Now, what was implied in this
transition, this transformation?

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:04.190
It was a vision of the world in
which Asia and Africa,

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:07.389
for Europeans,
or possibly Latin America,

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:08.350
for U.S.
 

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.758
citizens, were conceived in a
really charged fashion as

00:12:13.758 --> 00:12:19.166
harboring disease that were
conceptually different from

00:12:19.166 --> 00:12:23.597
other diseases,
that could not be treated by

00:12:23.597 --> 00:12:28.542
physicians who had graduated
from European medical schools

00:12:28.542 --> 00:12:33.658
unless they had undergone
special postgraduate training.

00:12:33.658 --> 00:12:41.548
And the implication too was a
different form of hygiene.

00:12:41.548 --> 00:12:45.856
And there was a work that was a
foundational text for this new

00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:49.118
medical specialty,
one of the most influential

00:12:49.118 --> 00:12:52.740
medical works of the whole of
the nineteenth century,

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:56.700
and one that had enormous
influence on the relations of

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.879
the metropolitan powers to their
colonial dependencies.

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:06.317
This work was by this man,
a British physician named

00:13:06.317 --> 00:13:10.797
Patrick Manson,
who came to be known as the

00:13:10.797 --> 00:13:14.210
father of tropical medicine.
 

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.710
The work that caused the stir
was called--

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.299
it's an enormous,
fat volume--entitled

00:13:22.299 --> 00:13:27.054
Tropical Diseases:
A Manual for the Diseases of

00:13:27.054 --> 00:13:29.190
Warm Climates.
 

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:35.058
And it was written in 1898,
which isn't an accident.

00:13:35.058 --> 00:13:39.859
And it wasn't also an accident
that the father of tropical

00:13:39.859 --> 00:13:43.964
medicine was British,
or that Britain became the

00:13:43.964 --> 00:13:46.928
world center of the new
discipline,

00:13:46.928 --> 00:13:52.779
Britain at the time being the
world's leading imperial power.

00:13:52.779 --> 00:13:58.692
Now, what were the background
conditions that promoted the

00:13:58.692 --> 00:14:04.190
emergence of this whole new
medical sub-discipline?

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.594
A first, as we said,
was Britain's position as a

00:14:08.594 --> 00:14:10.750
great colonial power.
 

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:16.696
There were others,
as well, that lay behind this

00:14:16.696 --> 00:14:19.860
new medical specialism.
 

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:24.274
One was something we've already
dealt with, and that is the germ

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:27.988
theory of disease and the
triumph of contagionism over

00:14:27.988 --> 00:14:29.460
anticontagionism.
 

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.259
The germ theory had a number of
possible implications.

00:14:34.259 --> 00:14:37.351
One was the idea,
as we've seen,

00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:42.340
of clinching the concept of
disease specificity.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.996
And tropical medicine was built
on the premise that some

00:14:46.996 --> 00:14:51.230
diseases lurking in Africa and
Asian now needed new

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.996
classifications,
belonging in special

00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:59.168
categories, and that to
understand them--

00:14:59.168 --> 00:15:01.759
and here was another of its
implications--

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:06.360
you needed physicians who were
trained at special institutions,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.966
and had a specialized
curriculum, and that they could

00:15:10.966 --> 00:15:16.017
be dealt with by specific
special remedies and measures of

00:15:16.017 --> 00:15:21.509
hygiene that were different from
those that had been successful

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:26.558
in bringing about a mortality
revolution in Europe.

00:15:26.558 --> 00:15:30.969
As you'll remember when we
examined the theories of Max van

00:15:30.969 --> 00:15:34.669
Pettenkofer,
the germ theory marked the end

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:38.168
of an alternative approach to
medicine,

00:15:38.168 --> 00:15:40.950
one that had flourished at
mid-century,

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:43.720
particularly in continental
Europe,

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:47.291
but was intellectually
vanquished by the laboratory

00:15:47.291 --> 00:15:51.399
methods of bacteriology,
and later parasitology.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:56.109
This was the idea of social
medicine, associated with a

00:15:56.109 --> 00:15:59.860
radical German physician,
Rudolf Virchow.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:03.831
For social medicine,
medicine was a collective

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:08.509
enterprise in which it was
important for physicians to

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.038
treat not only individual
patients,

00:16:12.038 --> 00:16:16.677
but society as a whole,
dealing with issues of sanitary

00:16:16.677 --> 00:16:20.301
conditions,
poverty, nutrition,

00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:22.340
social justice.
 

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.448
Well, the germ theory of
disease was a setback for social

00:16:26.448 --> 00:16:29.364
medicine,
and I'm going to argue that

00:16:29.364 --> 00:16:33.732
tropical medicine went even a
step further in the turn from

00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:35.090
that direction.
 

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:39.220
It argued that in the tropical
world the chief problem--

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:43.029
and we're talking with the
period down to World War I--

00:16:43.029 --> 00:16:48.062
the chief problem was to
preserve the health of European

00:16:48.062 --> 00:16:49.070
settlers.
 

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:54.201
As a discipline,
until much later in its life,

00:16:54.201 --> 00:17:00.359
tropical medicine largely
ignored the general health of

00:17:00.359 --> 00:17:03.210
indigenous societies.
 

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:07.345
This also came to mean
something somewhat sinister,

00:17:07.345 --> 00:17:11.977
when the logic was applied to
the global north and south,

00:17:11.977 --> 00:17:14.788
and black/white relationships.
 

00:17:14.788 --> 00:17:20.413
It seemed to suggest that the
bodies of Africans and teeming

00:17:20.413 --> 00:17:26.415
Asians were medically dangerous,
that they were the reservoirs

00:17:26.415 --> 00:17:31.838
for diseases that posed serious
new threats for Europeans.

00:17:31.838 --> 00:17:36.536
And there was an implication,
a possible strategy for

00:17:36.536 --> 00:17:39.692
hygiene,
and that was that perhaps the

00:17:39.692 --> 00:17:43.866
best way forward was for
Europeans and indigenous peoples

00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:47.670
to be segregated in their
housing arrangements,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:52.192
that Europeans should live in
the tropical world in special

00:17:52.192 --> 00:17:56.482
enclaves where the latest
prophylactic measures would be

00:17:56.482 --> 00:17:57.420
applied.
 

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.440
Whereas natives,
or indigenous peoples,

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:03.538
could be left as they had been
found.

00:18:03.538 --> 00:18:07.576
Alternatively,
if you read some of the

00:18:07.576 --> 00:18:13.578
literature produced by works of
European writers such as

00:18:13.578 --> 00:18:18.152
Somerset Maugham,
you'd see that the Europeans

00:18:18.152 --> 00:18:22.262
were advised to take to the
hills during the dangerous

00:18:22.262 --> 00:18:26.946
summer months,
leaving dangerous natives

00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:28.000
behind.
 

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.828
But we shouldn't forget that
tropical medicine,

00:18:30.828 --> 00:18:35.763
at the turn of the century,
was also where the scientific

00:18:35.763 --> 00:18:41.140
action and excitement in medical
science were taking place.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:45.953
Beyond the germ theory of
disease, tropical medicine

00:18:45.953 --> 00:18:49.730
embodied the various latest
developments,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:54.450
and above all the new science
of parasitology.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:57.634
And it attracted some of the
leading figures,

00:18:57.634 --> 00:19:01.903
indeed, in the development of
microbiology to enter this new

00:19:01.903 --> 00:19:02.990
discipline.
 

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.346
This was true,
for example,

00:19:05.346 --> 00:19:09.314
of Robert Koch,
who came, made a voyage,

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:14.759
to Italy to study parasitology
in the form of malaria,

00:19:14.759 --> 00:19:18.788
and then set off for the
colonial world.

00:19:18.788 --> 00:19:22.220
Pasteur at this time had just
died,

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.903
but his institute saw
affiliates or satellite

00:19:25.903 --> 00:19:30.174
institutes set up at Saigon,
at Tunis, Algiers,

00:19:30.174 --> 00:19:33.340
in the 1890s,
all preaching the new

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:36.598
discipline of tropical medicine.
 

00:19:36.598 --> 00:19:40.554
And Pasteur's most famous and
able disciple,

00:19:40.554 --> 00:19:44.599
�mile Roux,
became a specialist in this new

00:19:44.599 --> 00:19:45.980
discipline.
 

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.924
To understand it,
we need to remember two major

00:19:48.924 --> 00:19:49.950
breakthroughs.
 

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:57.308
The first was by Patrick Manson
in 1883.

00:19:57.308 --> 00:20:01.529
At that time,
he discovered something that

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:03.588
was radically new.
 

00:20:03.588 --> 00:20:08.078
He was dealing with the disease
of elephantiasis,

00:20:08.078 --> 00:20:12.942
and he found that the filarial
worm that causes it is

00:20:12.942 --> 00:20:19.061
transmitted by mosquitoes;
the first example of a vector

00:20:19.061 --> 00:20:22.259
borne disease transmission.
 

00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:26.528
This was epoch-making in that
respect.

00:20:26.528 --> 00:20:30.890
And it was also a movement from
bacteria or--

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:32.910
though it wasn't known at the
time--

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.308
viruses, to more complex life
forms,

00:20:37.308 --> 00:20:42.773
the interaction of humans with
biologically more sophisticated

00:20:42.773 --> 00:20:48.670
protozoa or helminths or worms,
and with insect vectors.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.759
Diseases could now be seen to
be part of a much more

00:20:53.759 --> 00:20:58.250
complicated process,
and with complicated life

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.250
forms.
 

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.884
Then there was,
following this,

00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:06.715
the establishment of the
mosquito theory of transmission

00:21:06.715 --> 00:21:11.315
for malaria,
which took place during the end

00:21:11.315 --> 00:21:15.337
of the decade of the 1890s,
with two figures,

00:21:15.337 --> 00:21:18.430
who were working independently
of each other,

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.324
but in 1898 established that
malaria was a parasitical

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:26.660
disease,
transmitted by certain species

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:27.818
of mosquitoes.
 

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:32.403
So, malaria--which is a disease
that we'll be dealing with after

00:21:32.403 --> 00:21:36.035
the spring break--
was of decisive importance in

00:21:36.035 --> 00:21:39.108
the establishment of tropical
medicine,

00:21:39.108 --> 00:21:44.305
and malaria was the disease
that was at its heart and its

00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:45.140
center.
 

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.453
The two people were in
Italy--and we'll be coming back

00:21:49.453 --> 00:21:55.255
to this in a couple of weeks,
when we resume classes--in

00:21:55.255 --> 00:22:00.538
Italy there was Giovanni
Battista Grassi,

00:22:00.538 --> 00:22:04.930
who made a very elegant
demonstration,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:09.848
and a very convincing one,
that human malaria was

00:22:09.848 --> 00:22:12.720
transmitted by mosquitoes.
 

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.592
And he did so by experiments in
which he introduced just one

00:22:18.592 --> 00:22:24.413
variable in the exposure,
during the warm summer months,

00:22:24.413 --> 00:22:28.460
of large populations to biting
insects.

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.788
He protected,
by screening,

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:35.355
or later by chemical means,
select groups of people,

00:22:35.355 --> 00:22:40.548
while everyone around them was
falling ill of malaria.

00:22:40.548 --> 00:22:45.101
They lived in exactly the same
conditions as those around them,

00:22:45.101 --> 00:22:49.672
except for one variable;
that they weren't subject to

00:22:49.672 --> 00:22:52.430
the bites of flying insects.
 

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:56.856
And thereby he established that
it was indeed insects,

00:22:56.856 --> 00:23:00.700
mosquitoes, and certain types
of mosquitoes;

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.509
we'll be returning to that.
 

00:23:02.509 --> 00:23:06.821
Not all mosquitoes,
just anophelene mosquitoes,

00:23:06.821 --> 00:23:12.354
and certain species of them,
that transmitted the disease of

00:23:12.354 --> 00:23:13.480
malaria.
 

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.521
At the same time,
Ronald Ross,

00:23:16.521 --> 00:23:22.726
a British physician in India,
was working instead with

00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:28.382
malaria among the avian--
that is, birds--avian malaria,

00:23:28.382 --> 00:23:33.612
where he demonstrated that it
too was transmitted by the bites

00:23:33.612 --> 00:23:35.068
of mosquitoes.
 

00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:38.670
And he argued,
by analogy, that human malaria

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.680
was probably transmitted by
mosquitoes as well.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:47.068
Now, this was the age of a
ferocious imperial rivalry,

00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:51.284
and Ross was the first British
scientist to discover the

00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:56.637
pathogen of a major disease,
and he became a national icon,

00:23:56.637 --> 00:24:00.509
the British answer to Pasteur
or Koch.

00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:04.397
He won the Nobel Prize,
and along with Manson became

00:24:04.397 --> 00:24:08.972
one of two decisive figures in
the founding of the discipline

00:24:08.972 --> 00:24:10.880
of tropical medicine.
 

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.299
It was quite interesting that
there was an extraordinary

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:19.318
collaboration between Manson and
Ross in India,

00:24:19.318 --> 00:24:24.215
where Ross wrote home what he
was finding under his microscope

00:24:24.215 --> 00:24:27.727
in India,
and sent that back to Manson,

00:24:27.727 --> 00:24:32.205
who worked with him in
suggesting new directions for

00:24:32.205 --> 00:24:34.980
his research,
and pushed him forward.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:39.940
So, in many ways the discovery
of the transmission of malaria

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.000
belonged to Manson as well as
Ross.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.778
Well, in any case,
malaria became the template,

00:24:46.778 --> 00:24:49.900
the ideal type of tropical
diseases.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:55.619
And in Manson's great work
malaria occupies the largest

00:24:55.619 --> 00:25:02.053
amount of space in the volume;
the reasons being that it was a

00:25:02.053 --> 00:25:07.549
perfectly vector-transmitted
disease, a perfect parasitic

00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:08.630
disease.
 

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:13.685
The plasmodium that causes it,
as we'll see in a couple of

00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:18.920
weeks, lives in a closed cycle,
and never exists free in the

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.338
environment.
 

00:25:20.338 --> 00:25:25.838
Human beings don't happen upon
it, and the plasmodium has an

00:25:25.838 --> 00:25:31.338
extremely complicated lifecycle
in both man and mosquito.

00:25:31.338 --> 00:25:35.288
And the involvement of the
mosquito also is scientifically

00:25:35.288 --> 00:25:37.971
complicated;
in other words,

00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:44.366
it was useful and important
that Grassi was a naturalist,

00:25:44.366 --> 00:25:47.450
was well as a physician.
 

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:53.862
Parasitology was scientifically
interesting, and intellectually

00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:54.380
so.
 

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.952
To study malariology,
one needed to be a physician,

00:25:57.952 --> 00:26:00.666
but also an entomologist,
a naturalist,

00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:04.240
and to have a knowledge of the
basic sciences.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.160
So, in 1898,
for a whole generation,

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.042
parasitology replaced
bacteriology as the cutting edge

00:26:14.042 --> 00:26:18.279
of medical science,
and it became the foundation of

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:22.243
this new discipline,
the rising discipline of

00:26:22.243 --> 00:26:24.140
tropical medicine.
 

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:31.858
Well, if that's how it emerges,
what is the new discipline?

00:26:31.858 --> 00:26:37.130
Manson defined tropical
medicine in his great work.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:42.906
For him, it was a special
discipline, with diseases of an

00:26:42.906 --> 00:26:47.548
area defined by geography and
warm climate.

00:26:47.548 --> 00:26:51.000
Diseases there,
he said, were unlike the

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.190
diseases of the temperate zone,
and they require therefore a

00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.848
special medical discipline to
deal with them,

00:26:59.848 --> 00:27:04.778
and they require physicians who
are specially trained in

00:27:04.778 --> 00:27:07.200
post-graduate institutes.
 

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.923
For that reason,
tropical medicine emerged

00:27:10.923 --> 00:27:14.740
outside of established medical
schools,

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:19.660
because it presupposed that
physicians needed a special

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:24.578
curriculum and training to deal
with diseases that were

00:27:24.578 --> 00:27:27.038
conceptually different.
 

00:27:27.038 --> 00:27:31.619
For example,
in 1898, in association with

00:27:31.619 --> 00:27:36.136
Joseph Chamberlain,
the secretary of state for the

00:27:36.136 --> 00:27:39.050
colonies--
and you can see the role of the

00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.430
state in the promotion of this
new discipline,

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.690
which was seen as important for
the promotion of imperial

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:49.973
interests--
and with the collaboration of

00:27:49.973 --> 00:27:53.414
Patrick Manson--
there was founded the London

00:27:53.414 --> 00:27:58.701
School of Tropical Medicine,
with the specific intention of

00:27:58.701 --> 00:28:03.769
training colonial medical
officers in a new medical

00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:08.005
discipline;
or very closely associated was

00:28:08.005 --> 00:28:12.038
the Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine.

00:28:12.038 --> 00:28:16.723
Another idea that Manson said
was essential to the new

00:28:16.723 --> 00:28:22.028
discipline was that tropical
diseases were caused not usually

00:28:22.028 --> 00:28:26.890
by bacteria but by more complex
biological agents,

00:28:26.890 --> 00:28:30.550
with complex
lifecycles--protozoa and

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.636
helmets--
and that they were transmitted

00:28:33.636 --> 00:28:38.480
by insect vectors,
like mosquitoes or the tsetse

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.089
fly.
 

00:28:39.089 --> 00:28:41.759
Malaria had pride of place.
 

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:45.038
It was the ideal type to
illustrate this,

00:28:45.038 --> 00:28:49.578
and it's the first disease that
Manson discusses in his work,

00:28:49.578 --> 00:28:53.519
and the disease he discusses at
greatest length.

00:28:53.519 --> 00:29:00.288
There were others of this type,
like trypanosomiasis,

00:29:00.288 --> 00:29:03.430
which was African sleeping
sickness,

00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:07.874
which was caused by a parasite
also that multiplies in the

00:29:07.874 --> 00:29:11.538
human bloodstream and causes
skin eruptions,

00:29:11.538 --> 00:29:14.828
anemia, chronic fever,
debilitation,

00:29:14.828 --> 00:29:19.618
lethargy and perhaps coma and
death.

00:29:19.618 --> 00:29:23.660
It was transmitted by the
tsetse fly.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.201
Or there was schistosomiasis,
caused by worms,

00:29:28.201 --> 00:29:32.338
with the snail as its
alternative host.

00:29:32.338 --> 00:29:36.481
Or leishmaniasis,
or yellow fever--a viral

00:29:36.481 --> 00:29:41.635
infection, it was later
discovered--transmitted by a

00:29:41.635 --> 00:29:44.868
certain species of mosquito.
 

00:29:44.868 --> 00:29:47.646
Well, so far,
if you were reading Manson's

00:29:47.646 --> 00:29:50.007
work,
you would've found the diseases

00:29:50.007 --> 00:29:53.172
I've just mentioned would be the
ones that you would've

00:29:53.172 --> 00:29:56.285
encountered,
and there was a kind of logical

00:29:56.285 --> 00:29:58.318
coherence to what they were.
 

00:29:58.318 --> 00:30:03.286
Diseases of places with warm
climates, transmitted by

00:30:03.286 --> 00:30:08.252
mosquitoes, caused not by
bacteria but rather by more

00:30:08.252 --> 00:30:10.450
complex life forms.
 

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.410
But Manson then goes on.
 

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.646
And what we see then is
something of a grab bag of

00:30:17.646 --> 00:30:22.230
diseases, that don't seem to
have much of a scientific

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.960
connecting link.
 

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.936
He mentions certain infectious
bacterial diseases,

00:30:28.936 --> 00:30:34.728
some of them very familiar to
you already: bubonic plague,

00:30:34.728 --> 00:30:36.759
Asiatic cholera.
 

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:39.548
He adds leprosy.
 

00:30:39.548 --> 00:30:43.910
He then moves on to certain
nutritional diseases:

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:49.000
pellagra,
which is caused by a deficiency

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.115
of niacin,
if your diet consists not of

00:30:53.115 --> 00:30:56.808
wheat,
but exclusively of corn;

00:30:56.808 --> 00:31:01.278
or beriberi,
or certain fungal diseases.

00:31:01.278 --> 00:31:08.538
And he even calls heatstroke a
tropical disease.

00:31:08.538 --> 00:31:14.890
Another background factor was
institutional.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:18.627
Should we call it the
institutionalization of this new

00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.108
medical discipline?
 

00:31:20.108 --> 00:31:23.415
That is, it coincides with the
high point of European

00:31:23.415 --> 00:31:24.180
expansion.
 

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.500
And this wasn't just a
coincidence.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:34.131
It was an important instrument
in the domination of Africa and

00:31:34.131 --> 00:31:36.232
India,
for instance,

00:31:36.232 --> 00:31:41.133
as important as gun powder,
enabling settlers to run mines

00:31:41.133 --> 00:31:44.210
and plantations,
traders to travel,

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.755
administrators to govern,
missionaries to preach,

00:31:48.755 --> 00:31:52.200
and soldiers to perform their
duties.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.068
For this reason,
tropical medicine rapidly

00:31:55.068 --> 00:31:59.569
attracts governmental backing,
certainly in the British case,

00:31:59.569 --> 00:32:02.710
and institutional support and
assistance,

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:07.351
from powerful economic
interests, with concerns in the

00:32:07.351 --> 00:32:08.838
tropical world.
 

00:32:08.838 --> 00:32:12.290
So, these institutions--in
Britain we've already talked

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.358
about the London School of
Tropical Medicine,

00:32:15.358 --> 00:32:18.730
the Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine,

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:23.460
the Royal Society of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.723
And it's embedded in a new
major journal,

00:32:26.723 --> 00:32:30.886
The Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene,

00:32:30.886 --> 00:32:32.519
founded in 1895.
 

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:35.848
In France, we see the Pasteur
Institute;

00:32:35.848 --> 00:32:40.412
in the United States,
such institutions as Johns

00:32:40.412 --> 00:32:44.021
Hopkins,
the Rockefeller Institute--and

00:32:44.021 --> 00:32:48.259
in particular its International
Health Division--

00:32:48.259 --> 00:32:51.098
the American Academy of
Tropical Medicine,

00:32:51.098 --> 00:32:54.298
the American Society of
Tropical Medicine.

00:32:54.298 --> 00:32:57.301
And in the U.S.,
there were a couple of

00:32:57.301 --> 00:32:59.118
distinctive features.
 

00:32:59.118 --> 00:33:03.842
One was the association of
tropical medicine with the

00:33:03.842 --> 00:33:09.018
military, and its leading
figures, Walter Reed and William

00:33:09.018 --> 00:33:12.558
Gorgas, were in fact Army
officers.

00:33:12.558 --> 00:33:18.021
And it was in the Western
hemisphere too that yellow fever

00:33:18.021 --> 00:33:23.578
replaced malaria as the
quintessential tropical disease.

00:33:23.578 --> 00:33:28.818
Some of the institutional links
can be seen in specific cases.

00:33:28.818 --> 00:33:32.400
An example that's recently been
studied,

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.953
somewhat intensively,
is the relationship of the

00:33:36.953 --> 00:33:42.188
Harvard Department of Tropical
Medicine to the colonial

00:33:42.188 --> 00:33:46.838
establishment of American power
in Liberia,

00:33:46.838 --> 00:33:51.308
and in particular the Firestone
rubber plantations.

00:33:51.308 --> 00:33:56.782
And one can see there the clear
role of tropical medicine in

00:33:56.782 --> 00:34:01.203
promoting,
if we like, the expansion of

00:34:01.203 --> 00:34:07.288
company interests to extract
resources from Liberia.

00:34:07.288 --> 00:34:12.271
This was an important
illustration of the uses that

00:34:12.271 --> 00:34:15.860
tropical medicine could be put
to.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:20.550
Well, what were some--if that's
what tropical medicine was as a

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.940
discipline--
what were some of its

00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:25.954
implications,
the implications of the

00:34:25.954 --> 00:34:28.559
worldview that it suggested?
 

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:36.014
One is that Africa,
Asia and Latin America had

00:34:36.014 --> 00:34:39.659
something in common.
 

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:44.007
This was an artificial
construction of European

00:34:44.007 --> 00:34:45.329
imagination.
 

00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:52.210
They were seen as reservoirs of
diseases that threatened Europe;

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:56.822
Europe protected by the
ramparts of civilization and

00:34:56.822 --> 00:34:58.449
medical science.
 

00:34:58.449 --> 00:35:02.538
So, tropical medicine embodied,
down to a later

00:35:02.538 --> 00:35:08.048
period--certainly in this period
down to the First World War--a

00:35:08.048 --> 00:35:10.360
Eurocentric worldview.
 

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.576
It was initially not responsive
to specific locations,

00:35:15.576 --> 00:35:20.594
as the tropics were
artificially constructed as some

00:35:20.594 --> 00:35:23.449
single homogeneous place.
 

00:35:23.449 --> 00:35:29.681
The natives of the tropics were
also conceptualized as somehow

00:35:29.681 --> 00:35:35.097
dangerous, harboring a vast
array of lethal and highly

00:35:35.097 --> 00:35:37.550
contagious diseases.
 

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:42.599
Another implication was that
tropical medicine was concerned,

00:35:42.599 --> 00:35:47.309
in the early decades of the new
century,

00:35:47.309 --> 00:35:51.900
primarily overwhelmingly,
with the help of Europeans--

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:56.730
settlers, administrators,
missionaries and soldiers.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.942
There was little concern for
the health of the indigenous

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:01.920
population.
 

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.585
Indeed, the medical problems of
the colonial world that received

00:36:06.585 --> 00:36:10.289
attention were those that
threatened Europeans,

00:36:10.289 --> 00:36:14.518
not the health problems of the
indigenous population.

00:36:14.518 --> 00:36:18.273
There was little attention to
the social and economic

00:36:18.273 --> 00:36:22.606
determinants of what we might
today call Third World problems

00:36:22.606 --> 00:36:25.172
of health,
such as poverty,

00:36:25.172 --> 00:36:28.139
labor conditions,
malnutrition.

00:36:28.139 --> 00:36:31.873
And there was a neglect of
major diseases that were often

00:36:31.873 --> 00:36:35.340
the major health problems of the
local population;

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:41.920
say dysentery or gonorrhea,
pneumonia, tuberculosis.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.221
In recent years,
in fact, the blindness of the

00:36:45.221 --> 00:36:49.402
past has even resulted in new
international attention to a

00:36:49.402 --> 00:36:53.610
group of diseases,
termed neglected tropical

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.853
diseases,
that cause large-scale

00:36:56.853 --> 00:37:01.300
suffering such as poverty,
low productivity,

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:07.902
poor pregnancy outcomes,
but that for decades received

00:37:07.902 --> 00:37:14.309
little funding or attention from
policymakers.

00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:16.900
More ironically,
a major issue,

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:20.010
not considered after World War
I,

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:26.364
as I said, was the impact of
colonialism itself on the

00:37:26.364 --> 00:37:30.679
inhabitants of the tropical
world;

00:37:30.679 --> 00:37:35.733
that is, there was no attention
to the way in which colonialism

00:37:35.733 --> 00:37:39.809
itself contributed to
environmental degradation;

00:37:39.809 --> 00:37:45.320
or promoted labor mobility in
unsanitary conditions;

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:50.791
the way in which it promoted
unplanned urbanization,

00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:55.190
low educational attainment and
poverty.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.543
In fact, this period,
the first period of tropical

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:03.213
medicine,
from 1890 to just after the

00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:07.215
First World War,
was a time, one of the times,

00:38:07.215 --> 00:38:12.369
of the greatest epidemiological
disasters in the tropical world,

00:38:12.369 --> 00:38:17.449
with virgin soil epidemics,
like smallpox and measles,

00:38:17.449 --> 00:38:23.840
and the impact of what was
called constructive imperialism.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:28.047
Railroads, roads,
trade, the transportation

00:38:28.047 --> 00:38:32.222
revolution,
all enabled a pandemic of

00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:36.476
bubonic plague,
from the 1890s to 1920,

00:38:36.476 --> 00:38:40.764
and epidemic influenza,
in 1918 and '19,

00:38:40.764 --> 00:38:45.050
to occur in the tropical world
as well.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:49.043
Colonial wars,
the involvement of the colonies

00:38:49.043 --> 00:38:53.570
in the two world wars,
had major disease impacts.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:58.199
So did the ecological impact of
railroads, factories,

00:38:58.199 --> 00:39:02.829
mines and plantations,
and the recruitment of migrant

00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:03.719
labor.
 

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:08.507
So, just as in the case that we
examined at greater length in

00:39:08.507 --> 00:39:13.056
your reading of North America,
disease played an important

00:39:13.056 --> 00:39:15.530
part in European expansion.
 

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:21.380
Another implication was public
health policy.

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:27.652
In Europe and North America,
hygiene had given rise to a

00:39:27.652 --> 00:39:33.630
broad-gauge sanitarian movement;
one that reformed urban living

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:36.429
conditions through what we might
call--

00:39:36.429 --> 00:39:41.309
and introducing a new jargon
into our course--

00:39:41.309 --> 00:39:46.159
horizontal programs of public
health;

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:51.219
that is, improvements that
dealt with living conditions

00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:54.780
across a broad spectrum of
diseases.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:58.889
We've seen that in the sanitary
movement.

00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:02.960
In the tropics,
instead, metropolitan powers

00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:07.976
applied a different vision of
what was called vertical

00:40:07.976 --> 00:40:11.099
hygiene, or tropical hygiene.
 

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:15.885
Now, vertical campaigns of
public health targeted instead

00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:18.894
single diseases,
and they were designed to

00:40:18.894 --> 00:40:23.123
protect, above all,
Europeans against the most

00:40:23.123 --> 00:40:25.480
menacing epidemics.
 

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:30.061
That was tropical hygiene, then;
something different from what

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:33.159
was practiced at the same time
in Europe, was one of the

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:34.059
implications.
 

00:40:34.059 --> 00:40:39.235
Another implication was a new
prestige and authority for

00:40:39.235 --> 00:40:40.460
physicians.
 

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.213
Ross and Koch,
for example,

00:40:43.213 --> 00:40:48.193
now became advisors to
metropolitan governments,

00:40:48.193 --> 00:40:50.099
as did Manson.
 

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:55.494
It meant also--another
implication was perhaps what we

00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:59.768
might call selective historical
amnesia.

00:40:59.768 --> 00:41:06.188
Many of the diseases identified
as tropical had only recently

00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:10.789
been present in Europe,
and they weren't eradicated by

00:41:10.789 --> 00:41:13.380
temperature,
but by broad social and

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.119
economic improvements.
 

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:19.150
Malaria itself had been a
European disease,

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.795
as you know,
bubonic plague and cholera

00:41:22.795 --> 00:41:23.659
also.
 

00:41:23.659 --> 00:41:28.411
And then tropical medicine was
clearly an instrument of

00:41:28.411 --> 00:41:31.579
cultural and ideological
hegemony.

00:41:31.579 --> 00:41:36.550
It was a justification and
rationale for colonialism.

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:41.085
Europeans felt that they had
health and civilization to

00:41:41.085 --> 00:41:46.126
offer, and that medicine was a
means of winning acceptance of

00:41:46.126 --> 00:41:48.309
the colonial presence.
 

00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:53.356
So, tropical medicine provided
a narrative of European

00:41:53.356 --> 00:41:57.842
progress,
rationality and civilization

00:41:57.842 --> 00:42:01.896
overcoming ignorance,
superstition,

00:42:01.896 --> 00:42:05.920
darkness and the witchcraft of
natives.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.311
Patrick Manson was very
explicit in his vision of the

00:42:10.311 --> 00:42:13.518
relationship of medicine and
empire.

00:42:13.518 --> 00:42:19.050
In a simple sentence he
declared, "I believe in the

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:24.280
colonization of the world by the
white race."

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:29.963
Well, that was the early period
of tropical medicine,

00:42:29.963 --> 00:42:32.804
between 1890,
more or less,

00:42:32.804 --> 00:42:38.380
and just at a period after the
First World War.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.539
Later we see a transformation
in the discipline.

00:42:42.539 --> 00:42:48.445
And I don't want to argue that
it's the same today as it was at

00:42:48.445 --> 00:42:51.590
the eve of the First World War.
 

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:57.297
Radical changes in tropical
medicine came through a number

00:42:57.297 --> 00:42:58.900
of influences.
 

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.280
One was the Second World War
itself,

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:07.228
which was in part--and although
there were deep contradictions

00:43:07.228 --> 00:43:10.376
involved in it--
it was in part,

00:43:10.376 --> 00:43:14.309
at least, a war against
racialism.

00:43:14.309 --> 00:43:20.458
The discipline was affected by
decolonization,

00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:28.110
also by the rise of American
hegemony after World War II,

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:31.389
with new priorities.
 

00:43:31.389 --> 00:43:36.257
It was influenced by
globalization as an explicit

00:43:36.257 --> 00:43:39.257
idea,
and its implications that we

00:43:39.257 --> 00:43:42.619
all live in a single disease
environment,

00:43:42.619 --> 00:43:47.543
and that what happens in
distant parts of the world are

00:43:47.543 --> 00:43:52.739
also vitally important for the
entire world population.

00:43:52.739 --> 00:43:57.809
And then there was--what was
very important also was a

00:43:57.809 --> 00:44:00.489
transformation in funding.
 

00:44:00.489 --> 00:44:06.610
Because of those factors,
around and during the 1970s,

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:11.717
The World Health Organization
introduced a major new emphasis

00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:15.237
on tropical diseases,
and with it,

00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:20.039
in 1975, a major new research
project.

00:44:20.039 --> 00:44:25.067
The same happened with the
Rockefeller Foundation in the

00:44:25.067 --> 00:44:30.460
1970s, and then the MacArthur
Foundation thereafterwards.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.818
And this meant a new dynamism
scientifically for the

00:44:34.818 --> 00:44:41.148
discipline of tropical medicine,
and also with that a major

00:44:41.148 --> 00:44:45.072
attention,
reversing an earlier trend,

00:44:45.072 --> 00:44:49.925
with an emphasis on global
health programs that would be

00:44:49.925 --> 00:44:54.702
applicable everywhere,
and that would include major

00:44:54.702 --> 00:45:00.201
attention to the health of the
population of indigenous peoples

00:45:00.201 --> 00:45:05.788
in areas that had been neglected
by an earlier phase of tropical

00:45:05.788 --> 00:45:07.030
medicine.
 

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.730
And, so, the entire discipline,
if we like,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.710
was transformed after World War
II,

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:17.389
and became something that no
longer embodied a colonial

00:45:17.389 --> 00:45:21.360
position,
and no longer embodied the idea

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.900
that it was the bodies of
Europeans that deserved

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:30.110
privileged protection,
rather than the health of

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.469
indigenous peoples in other
parts of the world.

00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:38.764
So, tropical medicine was a
very important instrument of

00:45:38.764 --> 00:45:44.539
colonial power in the period
down to the First World War,

00:45:44.539 --> 00:45:48.639
and it was slowly transformed
in the inter-war period,

00:45:48.639 --> 00:45:53.170
and radically so after World
War II.

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:58.333
I hope you'll bear that in mind
as you think about the issue of

00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:02.250
what are the implications of
medical science;

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:06.304
and what are its implications
for the kinds of society and the

00:46:06.304 --> 00:46:07.900
world that we live in?
 

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:13.000

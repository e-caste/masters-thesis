00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.930
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.727
I'll go ahead and start,
just 'cause I am not sure how

00:00:04.727 --> 00:00:06.050
many people will end up being
here.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.414
So, as promised,
today I will tell you a little

00:00:09.414 --> 00:00:12.413
bit about the exam,
and I'll show you some

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.655
questions from a past year so
that you can see what they're

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.750
like.
We rewrite the exam every year.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.726
Even makeup exams are all
different, so I have a lot of

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:30.017
these in my files.
The exam is two-and-a-half

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:34.774
hours in a three-hour slot.
We have two rooms,

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:39.204
'cause we have a big class.
They have given us this room

00:00:39.204 --> 00:00:44.414
and 102, so you can come to
either room for the event

00:00:44.414 --> 00:00:49.850
Friday, May 9,2:00pm to 5:00pm.
It has three parts.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.731
The first part is
identifications,

00:00:52.731 --> 00:00:57.010
and that's small things from
any of the novels.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.700
That could be a character.
It could be a place name.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.870
It could be even a couple of
words, a quotation,

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.120
and you have to give the author
and title that it comes from,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.106
of the book that it comes from,
and tell us what it is and a

00:01:12.106 --> 00:01:15.910
couple of sentences about its
significance,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.412
so why that thing is important.
Passages will be little

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:26.623
chunks of text from a novel.
Again, you'll have to know

00:01:26.623 --> 00:01:30.230
author and title,
and then you will have to do an

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.112
interpretation of the passage.
And then you have to say in a

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:40.000
couple of sentences how that
passage as you have interpreted

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.480
it is important to the book as a
whole.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.160
Oh, and you have to say the
context of the passage.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.428
Now this might differ.
I'll give you a couple of

00:01:49.428 --> 00:01:51.040
examples.
This'll be different.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.608
It might be a matter of saying
where in the plot it occurs or

00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:58.268
who, which character,
is speaking,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:02.130
what's going on in the scene
from which it's pulled,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.143
some sort of relevant context
so that we know that you

00:02:06.143 --> 00:02:09.400
understand where the thing comes
from.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.840
So you have fifteen minutes to
do each of those.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.400
The essay is 40% of the
final grade.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.994
You have a half an hour,
and--I'll show you--I have a

00:02:20.994 --> 00:02:22.789
special way of doing these
essays.

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:25.229
Usually, they're big,
general questions.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:30.654
A good way to review for that
is to look at the old essay

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:35.338
questions, the essay topics.
You'll find a lot of clues

00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:39.375
there about themes that unite
all the works on the syllabus,

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:42.180
so that can be a good way of
studying.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.979
In each of these sections
you will get to choose.

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.550
So, in the IDs usually I give
nine, and you get to choose six.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.127
In the passages,
I aim for seven and you choose

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:55.629
four.
In the essays I always give

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.102
three and you choose one.
Within the essays you can

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:05.379
choose between two lists of
books to use to answer your

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.577
questions.
You get to choose three of four

00:03:08.577 --> 00:03:12.059
on each of those two lists,
and I'll explain a little bit

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:14.360
why I do that when I show you
one.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.092
The one restriction on the
essay is that you may only write

00:03:19.092 --> 00:03:23.090
about one novel you've written a
long paper on,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.052
so only one of the three novels
that you choose to write about

00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:30.820
for the essay question can be
one that you wrote about in a

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.615
paper.
So your TF who will be grading

00:03:33.615 --> 00:03:37.690
the exam will know what you
wrote on, so just observe that

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.382
guideline.
It's written in the directions

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.477
of the exam.
Now, so,

00:03:43.477 --> 00:03:46.620
let me show you now what these
look like.

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.552
First of all,
I'm going to give you a couple

00:04:05.552 --> 00:04:07.500
IDs and we'll play a little
game.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.100
Who can identify this?
So, "sea horses."

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.503
Yes.
No, I'm not going to call on

00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:17.520
you, Sarah.
That's not fair.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:26.377
Only if they're all washed up.
Can anyone except Sarah

00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:30.319
identify this?
Okay, Sarah, go ahead.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.291
Student:
That's in

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:37.537
Housekeeping.
Professor Amy

00:04:37.537 --> 00:04:42.510
Hungerford: That's right.
Okay.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.371
Did that seem hard?
Judging by the paucity of

00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:50.858
answers it was.
Yes, that's exactly what you

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:53.005
need to say.
You need to say Marilynne

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:55.334
Robinson,
Housekeeping, and

00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:58.769
you'd have to explain that she
always wanted to look at this

00:04:58.769 --> 00:05:01.680
little drawing that her husband
made for her.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.850
Let me think of another one.
The dancing bear.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.398
More of you know that.
Yes, Helen.Student:

00:05:11.398 --> 00:05:15.558
Blood
Meridian.Professor

00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:18.400
Amy Hungerford:
Okay.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.721
Yes. Very good.
So you-- That's the end of

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:23.543
Blood Meridian.
You would have to say that

00:05:23.543 --> 00:05:27.591
it's at the very end in order to
get full credit for that ID,

00:05:27.591 --> 00:05:30.460
so you need to know that.
Let me think of another one.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.639
Oh, Lane as a name, Lane.
Yes.Student:

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.761
Franny and Zooey by
J.

00:05:36.761 --> 00:05:38.816
D.
Salinger.Professor Amy

00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:42.132
Hungerford: Yes,
absolutely, and you might want

00:05:42.132 --> 00:05:46.019
to say what he represents.
So, what would he represent?

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:48.571
If you were going to give a
sentence about what he

00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:50.715
represents, what would you say,
why he's

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:53.589
important?Student:
He represents kind of the

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.111
ideas of education,
and that education isn't always

00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:02.867
a good thing.Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:06:02.867 --> 00:06:07.839
Yes-- Student:
And that he's not

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:14.217
necessarily educated at all in
the way that other characters

00:06:14.217 --> 00:06:18.325
think is
important.Professor Amy

00:06:18.325 --> 00:06:22.338
Hungerford: Yes,
that's true,

00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:26.022
and he's pretentious.
So, he's much more interested

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:29.811
in his possibilities for
publication and how well he's

00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:34.386
done in his course than he is in
the wisdom that Franny and Zooey

00:06:34.386 --> 00:06:38.630
both value.
Okay. Yes. So you get the idea.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.487
That's what an ID is.
So, now let me show you a

00:06:43.487 --> 00:06:47.199
passage and we'll do some of
these.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:53.855
Now the important thing about
passages is that you talk about

00:06:53.855 --> 00:07:00.399
the language of the passage as
well as just what's in it.

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:05.513
So, these will be chosen for
the interest of their language,

00:07:05.513 --> 00:07:10.713
and you will want to note the
words and talk about why things

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:15.576
are said the way they're said.
Professor Amy

00:07:15.576 --> 00:07:18.930
Hungerford: Okay.
So here's one.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.014
Take a moment.
"Now is the time and folks,

00:07:23.014 --> 00:07:26.620
I just couldn't.
In silence I turned shoreward

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.953
and gravely, dutifully she also
turned and still hell screamed

00:07:30.953 --> 00:07:35.500
its counsel and still I could
not make myself drown the poor,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.670
slippery, big-bodied creature."
What is this from?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.318
Uh huh.
Student:

00:07:45.318 --> 00:07:46.032
It's from
Lolita.Professor

00:07:46.032 --> 00:07:46.480
Amy Hungerford:
Yes,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.795
and what is going on in this
scene?Student:

00:07:49.795 --> 00:07:53.449
Humbert is contemplating
killing Charlotte Haze,

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:54.299
Lolita's
mother.Professor Amy

00:07:54.299 --> 00:07:55.100
Hungerford: Very good.
Yes.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.575
That's all the context you
would need to identify this

00:07:59.575 --> 00:08:03.079
passage.
Now, take a minute and look.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:07.582
What do you think in the
language of this passage would

00:08:07.582 --> 00:08:11.814
be useful to comment on?
What do you notice about it,

00:08:11.814 --> 00:08:13.749
about the language?
Yes.Student:

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:14.837
They're using
"folks."Professor Amy

00:08:14.837 --> 00:08:15.659
Hungerford:
Yes.Student:

00:08:15.659 --> 00:08:16.868
He's addressing the
reader.Professor Amy

00:08:16.868 --> 00:08:19.143
Hungerford: Absolutely.
You would have to talk about

00:08:19.143 --> 00:08:21.790
that to get full credit for an
answer on this one.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.917
It's an address to the reader.
You'd need to talk about why he

00:08:25.917 --> 00:08:29.231
says that, so what would your
account be for why he says

00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:32.244
that?Student:
Because he's making a plea

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:34.905
for his innocence,
and he's addressing people in

00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.192
this formal manner to try and
sort of reach them on a

00:08:37.192 --> 00:08:38.908
friendship
level…Professor

00:08:38.908 --> 00:08:40.360
Amy Hungerford:
Exactly.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.803
Student:
Yes, and then he just wants

00:08:41.803 --> 00:08:42.933
to sort of paint a picture of
his own

00:08:42.933 --> 00:08:44.660
morality.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Okay.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:47.200
Yes. Very good.
That's a very nice way of

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.299
putting it, when you say he's
making a plea for his innocence.

00:08:50.299 --> 00:08:53.240
That is the whole context of
the novel.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.210
That's what sets up the novel;
that's the frame of the novel.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:59.610
And so, just by making that
observation, you've done an

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.759
important thing for the passage
identifications,

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:06.904
which is that you have drawn
its significance in the context

00:09:06.904 --> 00:09:10.139
of the larger novel,
the whole novel.

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:17.546
What else might warrant your
notice here, what other bits of

00:09:17.546 --> 00:09:20.104
the language?
Yes.Student:

00:09:20.104 --> 00:09:21.773
The attention to
bodies.Professor Amy

00:09:21.773 --> 00:09:24.685
Hungerford: Yes.
What about that?Student:

00:09:24.685 --> 00:09:28.538
The opposition he sets up
between Charlotte's body and

00:09:28.538 --> 00:09:30.601
Lolita's.
Professor Amy

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.170
Hungerford: Absolutely,
yes, so that would be perfect,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.299
nice and economical.
What else?

00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:41.280
What else do you see there that
you could comment on?

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.395
Yes.
Student:

00:09:46.395 --> 00:09:49.983
The way that he frames the
explanation like he's a

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:53.299
hero.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yes.

00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:55.869
Yeah, and what would you make
of that in an

00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:59.050
answer?Student:
Well, that as much as he's

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.127
trying to prove his innocence,
he also really thinks he's

00:10:02.127 --> 00:10:04.277
actually doing the right thing
there.Professor Amy

00:10:04.277 --> 00:10:06.669
Hungerford: Yes.
Well, we're laughing about it.

00:10:06.669 --> 00:10:10.921
You would probably want to note
that it's a comic use of that

00:10:10.921 --> 00:10:14.646
literary convention,
and so you could say something

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:18.039
about his deployment of
conventional language,

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:25.675
either for satirical use or for
comedy or to play up the drama

00:10:25.675 --> 00:10:32.197
of his self-understanding.
So that would be a nicer point,

00:10:32.197 --> 00:10:37.453
a somewhat more subtle
observation, that would set your

00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:43.780
exam-grading TF into a state of
happiness, much to be desired.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.290
All right.
Let me see.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:47.940
I'll show you another one.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:00.490
Okay.
This one.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.330
Take a minute and read it.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:39.710
Okay. What's this from?
The Known World.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.636
Okay.
Sometimes we will take out

00:11:43.636 --> 00:11:46.783
character names.
I've done this with Oedipa,

00:11:46.783 --> 00:11:49.758
in the past,
in Crying of Lot 49,

00:11:49.758 --> 00:11:53.372
just because it's so
identified with her that it

00:11:53.372 --> 00:11:56.490
seems like too much of a dead
giveaway.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.577
I don't do that very often.
Here, Augustus is an easy

00:12:00.577 --> 00:12:03.584
identifier.
What would you want to say

00:12:03.584 --> 00:12:06.292
about this passage?
What do you notice about it

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.140
that seems worth accounting for?

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.148
Uh huh.Student:
You can probably,

00:12:22.148 --> 00:12:23.590
with the phrase "I know what I
know,"

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.989
connect to the title of The
Known World and make a

00:12:26.989 --> 00:12:30.692
comment about how our world is
defined by what we know and the

00:12:30.692 --> 00:12:33.242
perception of God's truth and
how that fits

00:12:33.242 --> 00:12:36.460
in.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Uh huh.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.201
Absolutely, yeah,
and if you could tie that

00:12:39.201 --> 00:12:42.725
notion of God's truth to the
godlike omniscience of the

00:12:42.725 --> 00:12:46.706
narrator in The Known World
that would be a great thing

00:12:46.706 --> 00:12:49.533
to do,
and that would be a way to tie

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:53.756
your analysis of this passage to
the concerns of the novel as a

00:12:53.756 --> 00:12:55.399
whole,
so that would be good to do.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:59.223
What else do you notice that
you could make use of

00:12:59.223 --> 00:13:01.720
thematically or formally here?

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.853
Uh huh. Eli.
Privilege Student:

00:13:18.853 --> 00:13:21.836
You could connect it to a
vision of morality,

00:13:21.836 --> 00:13:25.129
like the way Mildred and Henry
treat their slaves,

00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:36.118
related to the way God treats
his children…

00:13:36.118 --> 00:13:46.210
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Right.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:53.374
So both in your example of
Mildred and Henry--not Mildred,

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:58.779
Henry and….Now I've lost
her name.

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:00.750
What is her name,
his wife's name?

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.865
Caldonia.
Henry and Caldonia have this

00:14:04.865 --> 00:14:09.804
vision of a pure morality that
they could sponsor in their

00:14:09.804 --> 00:14:13.841
slave-holding life,
and, similarly,

00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:19.832
this is Barnum Kinsey speaking.
You'd want to identify the

00:14:19.832 --> 00:14:23.950
speaker here.
Barnum Kinsey dreams of a pure

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:29.740
space in which he could do the
morally right thing,

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.913
but as Eli was saying this is a
novel in which no such space or

00:14:33.913 --> 00:14:37.200
light is possible,
so you'd want to note that.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:43.725
That's more a thematic element
of this, but you would want to

00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:47.299
note that.
That's really important.

00:14:47.299 --> 00:14:49.759
Anything else that we might
want to say?

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:52.888
Yes.Student:
Well, in the language he

00:14:52.888 --> 00:14:56.549
repeats "a body could say" and "
a body could stand,"

00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:59.632
and it's kind of a way of
preventing literary means of

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:02.539
being excluding the
illiterate.Professor Amy

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:04.720
Hungerford: Uh huh.
Yeah.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.710
I think you can definitely talk
about that.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.830
I think there are a couple of
ways.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.704
One is to associate it with
literacy so that just

00:15:10.704 --> 00:15:12.980
being is a way of
testifying,

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.801
somehow, that Barnum,
in behaving the way he would

00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:22.426
have wanted to behave,
could have done the moral

00:15:22.426 --> 00:15:25.807
thing.
But there is a contrast here

00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:29.231
between saying it,
being the moral thing,

00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:34.196
and his having stood by as a
body in that scene and allowed

00:15:34.196 --> 00:15:37.450
Augustus to be sold into
slavery.

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:42.750
So, you could certainly make
hay of that elocution.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.896
And, for any example that uses
dialect in this way,

00:15:46.896 --> 00:15:50.938
you do want to interrogate it.
So, don't just say,

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:55.175
"Well, that's just trying to
sound like someone would sound

00:15:55.175 --> 00:15:59.279
like in this social situation."
Don't stop there.

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:03.360
Know that the passages will be
chosen so that any irregularity

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.107
of language, even if it's for
the purposes of realism and

00:16:07.107 --> 00:16:09.489
dialect,
is probably going to be

00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:13.927
something you can talk about.
So, just be aware of that and

00:16:13.927 --> 00:16:19.094
creative in thinking about what
that variation in language could

00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:20.490
mean.
Okay.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:21.630
Let me show you another.

00:17:08.790 --> 00:17:10.799
Okay. What's that from?
Yes.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:11.395
Student:
On the

00:17:11.395 --> 00:17:12.309
Road?Professor Amy
Hungerford:

00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:13.289
Yes,
it's from On the

00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:15.240
Road, and what would
you want to say about it?

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.267
What's important to notice
about the language and what's

00:17:22.267 --> 00:17:25.270
important in the thematics of it
and the content of it?

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:40.346
Yes, Sarah?Sarah:
 You could talk about the

00:17:40.346 --> 00:17:47.275
way that Sal looks at Dean's
language as a way of getting at

00:17:47.275 --> 00:17:53.382
a more intimate way of
understanding language…

00:17:53.382 --> 00:17:59.020
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.116
absolutely.
So words like that--You'd need

00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:06.220
to talk about Dean's language
and, just as Sarah has done,

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.768
put it in the context of our
understanding of Dean's language

00:18:08.768 --> 00:18:10.849
and its evolution over the
course of the novel,

00:18:10.849 --> 00:18:15.113
so that does the work of
getting your interpretation into

00:18:15.113 --> 00:18:19.299
the context of an entire
interpretation of the novel.

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.769
And there is that sense of
immediacy;

00:18:21.769 --> 00:18:26.741
so, making up words in an
attempt to get at an unusual

00:18:26.741 --> 00:18:30.170
proximity to experience.
Okay.

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:31.800
What else would you want to
notice?

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.580
Well, what's he talking about?

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:54.243
Yes.
Student:

00:18:54.243 --> 00:19:02.441
[inaudible]Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.569
Okay.
Yes.

00:19:05.569 --> 00:19:07.113
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:19:07.113 --> 00:19:08.490
Amy Hungerford:
Especially in what?

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.558
Sorry.Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:19:11.558 --> 00:19:13.859
Amy Hungerford:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:13.859 --> 00:19:17.149
The language and the way Dean's
language falls apart over the

00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:20.330
course of the novel is one way
that he's trying to get at a

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.734
different kind of language.
But music is the figure for

00:19:23.734 --> 00:19:27.331
another way, or it's another
figure for that effort to get

00:19:27.331 --> 00:19:29.730
beyond the limitations of
language.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:35.190
And here the way jazz is being
described, its ability to

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.750
capture some ineffable thing,
"it," is what you'd want to

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.411
highlight.
So, you'd want to connect that

00:19:44.411 --> 00:19:47.970
analysis of how jazz is being
described, here,

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:51.483
with the role of jazz in the
novel as a whole,

00:19:51.483 --> 00:19:55.310
especially in the novel's
linguistic ambitions,

00:19:55.310 --> 00:20:01.363
its literary ambitions.
You might want to notice the

00:20:01.363 --> 00:20:05.279
empty space that's highlighted
here.

00:20:05.279 --> 00:20:09.323
It's another version of the
vagueness of spirituality in a

00:20:09.323 --> 00:20:12.089
couple of our novels on the
syllabus,

00:20:12.089 --> 00:20:16.042
but certainly in On the
Road, the vagueness of that

00:20:16.042 --> 00:20:19.996
thing that they are looking for.
And also,

00:20:19.996 --> 00:20:25.401
you could talk about the
communal dynamics of

00:20:25.401 --> 00:20:28.349
meaning-making,
here,

00:20:28.349 --> 00:20:34.379
and you could connect that with
how it's important that Sal and

00:20:34.379 --> 00:20:40.312
Dean operate in this larger set
of people that sort of ebb and

00:20:40.312 --> 00:20:45.858
flow throughout the novel.
This is not the individual

00:20:45.858 --> 00:20:50.408
artist sitting alone,
but rather a dream of an

00:20:50.408 --> 00:20:56.172
American identity that is
somehow built in a free-thinking

00:20:56.172 --> 00:21:00.095
community of people,
or a free-acting community of

00:21:00.095 --> 00:21:01.255
people.
So, you get that,

00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.536
and all of a sudden,
somewhere in the middle of the

00:21:03.536 --> 00:21:06.519
chorus, he gets it.
Everybody looks up and knows.

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:11.307
There is a dream there of a
shared meaning-making moment

00:21:11.307 --> 00:21:15.213
that everyone will know.
It will be immediately

00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:20.329
compelling.
"Rehashes of old blowing."

00:21:20.329 --> 00:21:24.414
He's talking about how jazz
musicians are in conversation

00:21:24.414 --> 00:21:28.025
with a tradition.
You could use that little piece

00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:31.686
and talk about the way that
On the Road is in

00:21:31.686 --> 00:21:35.059
conversation with other literary
traditions,

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:39.440
how it imagines itself as a
revision of modernism.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.445
We had a wonderful paper that I
think some of you saw as a

00:21:44.445 --> 00:21:49.802
sample about the relationship
between Hemingway and Kerouac in

00:21:49.802 --> 00:21:52.552
this novel.
I didn't lecture on this,

00:21:52.552 --> 00:21:55.877
but if any of you saw that
paper, that's an example of what

00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:59.373
you might want to say about the
relationship between tradition

00:21:59.373 --> 00:22:02.132
and innovation,
which is thematized here in

00:22:02.132 --> 00:22:04.940
jazz, but it's acted out in the
novel as well.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.069
Okay.
Do you get the idea of how

00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:08.230
these work?
Okay.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.829
So this is what I'm looking for
in the passages.

00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:23.323
Now, in the essays,
usually, we have extremely

00:22:23.323 --> 00:22:33.028
broad questions,
some of which are more

00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:41.619
theoretical than others.
Some are more thematic.

00:22:41.619 --> 00:22:45.014
We had one I'll show you in a
minute about work that looks

00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:48.059
quite different from this one,
but here is the question:

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:50.747
"It is often said that many of
the humanistic disciplines of

00:22:50.747 --> 00:22:53.436
the second half of the twentieth
century are marked by their

00:22:53.436 --> 00:22:55.881
interest in language itself.
In other words,

00:22:55.881 --> 00:22:59.019
language becomes not just a
medium but a problem.

00:22:59.019 --> 00:23:02.170
To what extent are the problems
of language foregrounded in the

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.849
novels of this period?
What are the consequences of

00:23:04.849 --> 00:23:06.829
this turn for the writing of
fiction?

00:23:06.829 --> 00:23:09.817
How does such a foregrounding
affect the traditional terms of

00:23:09.817 --> 00:23:11.559
the novel, concerns of the
novel,

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:14.954
the creation of character,
the relationship between style

00:23:14.954 --> 00:23:17.500
and content, problems of
verisimilitude,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:20.641
etc.?"Now,
you would have to choose one of

00:23:20.641 --> 00:23:23.504
those groups,
and then within one of those

00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:27.763
groups of novels you would need
to choose three of the four to

00:23:27.763 --> 00:23:30.612
talk about.
So, the essay will be bringing

00:23:30.612 --> 00:23:33.549
together three novels around one
of these questions.

00:23:33.549 --> 00:23:37.851
The reason I group them this
way is because some of the

00:23:37.851 --> 00:23:42.631
novels on the syllabus you could
put together and have a very

00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:47.569
partial account of what fiction
in this period looks like.

00:23:47.569 --> 00:23:54.859
So, say your novels were Barth,
Pynchon and Foer.

00:23:54.859 --> 00:23:59.330
All of them have very similar
formal ambitions.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.859
Okay.
I would not make it possible

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:06.978
for you to do that.
So, I'm looking for you to be

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:11.348
able to take texts that seem
unlike in their concerns and in

00:24:11.348 --> 00:24:15.867
their formal elements and put
them into conversation with each

00:24:15.867 --> 00:24:18.830
other around a particular
question.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:23.163
Okay.
Similarly, I would not ask you

00:24:23.163 --> 00:24:28.778
to do Woman Warrior,
Bluest Eye, and Known

00:24:28.778 --> 00:24:31.923
World.
I wouldn't ask you to do

00:24:31.923 --> 00:24:36.076
probably Woman Warrior,
Bluest Eye, and Human

00:24:36.076 --> 00:24:40.560
Stain, either.
It's all too much about

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:46.236
identity in somewhat similar
terms, so I wouldn't ask you

00:24:46.236 --> 00:24:50.311
those novels together.
So, you can see that I mix them

00:24:50.311 --> 00:24:51.800
up.
Don't forget Black Boy.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.815
That will be on the exam.
If you joined the course in the

00:24:55.815 --> 00:24:59.289
middle of reading week--in the
middle of shopping period--you

00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:02.590
might want to go back and fill
that into your reading,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.539
if you haven't read that.
Let's see.

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:09.240
Questions about the essay
questions.

00:25:16.849 --> 00:25:22.000
I highly, highly recommend that
you take the time to outline.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.327
If you're not used to taking
essay exams, or even if you are,

00:25:26.327 --> 00:25:29.920
it is a huge help.
It's actually a time saver.

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.376
It ensures that you don't get
bogged down in sentence

00:25:33.376 --> 00:25:36.052
constructions.
When we grade these,

00:25:36.052 --> 00:25:40.807
typically what we do is make
checks in the margin every time

00:25:40.807 --> 00:25:45.401
you make a specific point and
use a specific citation of a

00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:49.555
specific part of a novel.
So, you can't quote 'cause you

00:25:49.555 --> 00:25:52.680
don't have the books in front of
us, in front of you,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.645
although if you do want to use
passages that are on the exam

00:25:56.645 --> 00:26:01.001
you can quote from those.
You can use parts of the exam

00:26:01.001 --> 00:26:05.559
for quotation in the essay,
but you do need to say,

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:10.329
"When Morrison starts each
chapter of The Bluest Eye

00:26:10.329 --> 00:26:14.039
with that quotation from the
primer,

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:18.592
she is highlighting how
learning language is also

00:26:18.592 --> 00:26:23.618
learning a kind of racial
prejudice and it's a kind of

00:26:23.618 --> 00:26:28.740
racial prejudice rooted in
aesthetic appreciation.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:33.329
She highlights the colors that
appear in the primer and

00:26:33.329 --> 00:26:36.559
prettiness of Jane's dresses."
Okay.

00:26:36.559 --> 00:26:39.958
I didn't quote anything from
The Bluest Eye,

00:26:39.958 --> 00:26:43.806
but I'm pointing to it in
such a way that that would have

00:26:43.806 --> 00:26:46.819
several checks in the column in
the margin,

00:26:46.819 --> 00:26:50.665
and basically what we do is we
rack it up and we see whether

00:26:50.665 --> 00:26:54.445
for each novel you've made a
number of specific points that

00:26:54.445 --> 00:26:58.488
add up to an argument.
Now, in this essay this is

00:26:58.488 --> 00:27:03.183
the only place where we really
don't want you simply coughing

00:27:03.183 --> 00:27:07.880
up lecture or something that
you've discussed in section.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.367
This is, like the papers,
something of an opportunity to

00:27:11.367 --> 00:27:14.029
draw things together in an
original way.

00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:18.188
There are lots of threads that
connect the novels in the

00:27:18.188 --> 00:27:20.945
syllabus.
If you've been attending the

00:27:20.945 --> 00:27:25.140
lectures, you will already have
lots of those in your notes,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.726
so you can draw from that,
but you should be thinking

00:27:27.726 --> 00:27:30.236
about it on your own.
For the passages,

00:27:30.236 --> 00:27:34.495
when you start to make claims
about why the passage is

00:27:34.495 --> 00:27:37.167
important,
in the context of the novel as

00:27:37.167 --> 00:27:40.421
a whole, you may find yourself
using arguments that were made

00:27:40.421 --> 00:27:44.890
in lecture or in section,
and that's fine.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:49.054
So, it gives you the larger
context in which you can show us

00:27:49.054 --> 00:27:53.360
that you're able to look at the
specific words on the page and

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.209
tell us something about them.
That's the skill we're testing

00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:00.707
in the passages.
Here, it's more your synthetic

00:28:00.707 --> 00:28:05.279
knowledge and your way of
bringing things together.

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:08.394
So in studying for the exam
portion, as I say,

00:28:08.394 --> 00:28:12.548
read over the paper topics and
make little lists for yourself

00:28:12.548 --> 00:28:15.940
of kinds of evidence that you
would point to,

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.593
maybe four or five bits of
evidence for each novel,

00:28:20.593 --> 00:28:25.486
or for a number of novels,
that might help you answer a

00:28:25.486 --> 00:28:29.160
question like that on the exam.
Or, sit and think;

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.180
read a question and think to
your mind, "okay,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:35.576
which scenes would I note;
which scenes would I want to

00:28:35.576 --> 00:28:39.428
talk about?"
That's a good exercise for

00:28:39.428 --> 00:28:43.759
studying.
Any questions about this?

00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:48.460
Okay.
Let me show you one more.

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:52.893
So, that's a very,
sort of, literary kind of

00:28:52.893 --> 00:28:59.044
version of the exam question.
Let me show you something of a

00:28:59.044 --> 00:29:03.180
more, perhaps a cultural studies
version.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.375
Here's one about work.
The quotation is from Plot

00:29:06.375 --> 00:29:09.559
Against America,
Philip Roth's recent novel,

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:14.388
which is what I taught of his
last year, so that obviously

00:29:14.388 --> 00:29:18.716
would not occur on our exam.
""The men worked fifty,

00:29:18.716 --> 00:29:21.980
sixty, even seventy or more
hours a week.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.387
The women worked all the time
with little assistance from

00:29:24.387 --> 00:29:27.160
labor-saving devices."
Discuss the status of work in

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.770
the post-1945 American novel.
Who works and who doesn't?

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:33.663
How is work represented?
What kinds of work are

00:29:33.663 --> 00:29:35.730
valorized?
What kinds are vilified?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.244
What is the place of labor in
these novels' vision of

00:29:40.244 --> 00:29:42.914
America?"
So, that's a more thematic

00:29:42.914 --> 00:29:47.135
question, but in all of these we
really want you to be noting how

00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:50.454
narratives are put together,
how language is used,

00:29:50.454 --> 00:29:54.097
what choices the novel made in
privileging either description

00:29:54.097 --> 00:29:56.829
of character and development of
character,

00:29:56.829 --> 00:30:04.859
development of setting,
creativity in voices and tones.

00:30:04.859 --> 00:30:08.951
So, all those formal things
that have to do with language

00:30:08.951 --> 00:30:12.763
choices would still be relevant.
Here you might want to talk

00:30:12.763 --> 00:30:15.859
about the work of the writer as
that novel imagines it.

00:30:15.859 --> 00:30:19.751
We've talked about that over,
on and off over the course of

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:22.660
the term.
What is the literary project?

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:28.230
What does the literary project
have to do with other kinds of

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.929
work?
So, generally,

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:38.689
partly because this course is
cross-listed in American

00:30:38.689 --> 00:30:41.988
Studies,
I like to have something of a

00:30:41.988 --> 00:30:45.248
balance between those very
literary formal questions like

00:30:45.248 --> 00:30:47.809
that first one I showed you and
this one,

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:54.610
which is a little bit more
about a vision of America.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.360
Okay.
Any questions?

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:09.440
You probably have your ways
of studying by now.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:12.690
Even freshmen have been here
for a year.

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:16.884
Let me just say a couple things
about the process of studying

00:31:16.884 --> 00:31:20.799
and of taking exams that maybe
will be helpful to you.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:32.423
My ideal way of studying for an
exam is to use sleep

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:38.074
strategically.
Sleep can do amazing things for

00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:41.049
the consolidation of knowledge
in your brain.

00:31:41.049 --> 00:31:43.250
Maybe some of you have
discovered this already.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:47.061
Maybe some of you have
discovered its negative,

00:31:47.061 --> 00:31:51.369
what it does not do for you
when you do not sleep.

00:31:51.369 --> 00:31:56.225
If you can arrange it so that
you spend time so you get all

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:59.643
your reading done,
read over all your notes,

00:31:59.643 --> 00:32:03.966
then sit down with those paper
topics, and while you're sitting

00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:09.200
with the paper topics,
that's when you move from going

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.930
from the passive mode to the
active mode.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.660
So, you review all your notes,
sit down with the paper topics.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.720
In that active mode,
do what I was suggesting.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:25.444
Think of scenes that pertain to
those topics for a number of the

00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:28.743
novels, for each one.
Just work through that for

00:32:28.743 --> 00:32:32.252
awhile, until you can't do it
anymore, and then go to sleep

00:32:32.252 --> 00:32:35.330
right away.
Do not check your e-mail.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.627
Do not browse the web.
Do not shoot the breeze with

00:32:38.627 --> 00:32:43.630
your roommate.
[laughs] Just go to bed.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:46.579
There is a lot of research
that's been done about the

00:32:46.579 --> 00:32:49.529
effect of doing this without
distracting yourself.

00:32:49.529 --> 00:32:57.744
You still get a benefit if you
distract yourself and then go to

00:32:57.744 --> 00:33:00.168
bed.
You still retain more of the

00:33:00.168 --> 00:33:03.484
knowledge the next morning,
but it's even better if you do

00:33:03.484 --> 00:33:07.370
it without distracting yourself.
So, take it to bed with you,

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:10.740
so you can sink right into bed,
into sleep, later.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:16.279
Even if you can only nap even
for twenty minutes or half an

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:20.981
hour, it still has an effect.
So, say you have to study for

00:33:20.981 --> 00:33:24.826
this exam during one half of the
day, and then you have to go and

00:33:24.826 --> 00:33:28.130
take another exam during the
second half of the day.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:32.222
Take a nap in between.
It's probably worth the half

00:33:32.222 --> 00:33:35.920
hour you don't spend thinking
about more paper topics,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.201
or reading your notes over
again, or looking at the novels

00:33:39.201 --> 00:33:41.750
to do that.
It's probably worth it.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.844
Okay.
So that's my first tip:

00:33:43.844 --> 00:33:47.868
Use sleep strategically.
My second reflection on

00:33:47.868 --> 00:33:52.470
exam taking is that--you may
dismiss this out of hand,

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.451
given the profession that I
then took up--but I actually

00:33:55.451 --> 00:33:59.211
used to like taking exams.
And the reason was that,

00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:04.440
once you went through that work
of reading things over,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.394
processing it,
after you took the exam itself,

00:34:07.394 --> 00:34:10.939
I always felt that the
knowledge of a course was really

00:34:10.939 --> 00:34:14.592
my own then.
It came together in a way that

00:34:14.592 --> 00:34:19.449
was much more solid for me than
before I took the exam.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:23.064
So, right now the themes of the
course might just be a

00:34:23.064 --> 00:34:25.997
collection of memories,
or partial memories,

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:28.929
and in your notes,
and sort of chaotic.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.667
But once you study for the
exam, and you get some distance

00:34:32.667 --> 00:34:36.078
from it--with sleep--and you
actually write the exam,

00:34:36.078 --> 00:34:38.570
that knowledge is really your
own.

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.854
So, I would encourage you to
see exam period,

00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:45.289
not just in this class but in
all your classes,

00:34:45.289 --> 00:34:47.752
as a real time,
an important time,

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:52.031
of consolidation.
You worked very hard during the

00:34:52.031 --> 00:34:56.410
term in all your classes,
I hope, and whatever you did

00:34:56.410 --> 00:35:01.120
can really become yours in a new
way during this time.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.817
So use it well.
And, I hope that you'll-in some

00:35:04.817 --> 00:35:08.858
way, some part of you--will
enjoy that process of really

00:35:08.858 --> 00:35:12.180
coming to own that knowledge.
Okay.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.500
Any questions about the exam?

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:20.200
Okay.
Any questions about anything in

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:20.700
the course?

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.862
Eli.Student:
I wanted to ask why "1945"

00:35:36.862 --> 00:35:41.033
is particularly
important.Professor Amy

00:35:41.033 --> 00:35:46.918
Hungerford: Why postwar?
Well, in America that marks two

00:35:46.918 --> 00:35:49.808
things for me.
One is the rise of the mass

00:35:49.808 --> 00:35:51.724
market and that
changes…Well,

00:35:51.724 --> 00:35:53.750
actually I would say three
things.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.524
The rise of the mass market
changes the relationship between

00:35:57.524 --> 00:36:00.659
readership and the literature
that's out there.

00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:05.168
So, it used to be that "high
literature" was not published in

00:36:05.168 --> 00:36:09.827
paperback, but the rise of the
mass-market paperback meant that

00:36:09.827 --> 00:36:14.110
suddenly books that would never
be accessible to a sort of

00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:18.017
average middle-class or
working-class person suddenly

00:36:18.017 --> 00:36:22.253
became so.
So, it's a huge watershed in

00:36:22.253 --> 00:36:27.360
the demographics of readership.
So, that's one reason.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:32.029
A second reason is related
to this, and that's that

00:36:32.029 --> 00:36:37.217
hundreds of thousands of men
came back and went to college on

00:36:37.217 --> 00:36:41.800
the GI Bill who had never been
to college before.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.050
Nobody in their families had
ever been to college before.

00:36:44.050 --> 00:36:46.920
This also changed the
readership dramatically.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:52.195
It was a time of an enormous
boom in college enrollments,

00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:57.659
and part of that was a huge
boom in English enrollments.

00:36:57.659 --> 00:37:02.729
Literature was a way for people
who had never been to college

00:37:02.729 --> 00:37:07.798
before to feel that they were
entering in to the upper middle

00:37:07.798 --> 00:37:12.867
class because it was a kind of
pursuit that was marked by its

00:37:12.867 --> 00:37:19.779
bourgeois prestige,
or its prestige marked you as

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:23.503
bourgeois.
So, for people interested in

00:37:23.503 --> 00:37:27.380
raising their class status,
and that was lots of people,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:30.849
coming into the educational
system, higher education,

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:34.320
for the first time,
literature was very important.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.308
There is a whole story about
why literature is no longer that

00:37:40.308 --> 00:37:46.496
class-marking enterprise that it
was at mid century that has to

00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:51.562
do with the rise of writing,
the competence in writing being

00:37:51.562 --> 00:37:54.884
more important than the
competence in literary tradition

00:37:54.884 --> 00:37:57.119
to mark you as an educated
person.

00:37:57.119 --> 00:38:02.783
So, that's an interesting story
in itself, but in general 1945

00:38:02.783 --> 00:38:07.625
is the beginning of that.
The third thing is that,

00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:12.378
by 1945, the innovations of
modernism are really very well

00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:15.684
established.
The big careers of early

00:38:15.684 --> 00:38:20.219
century literary enterprise are
totally established,

00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:23.720
and they have been assumed
almost fully into the

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.039
institution of the university
through the New Criticism.

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:31.960
The New Criticism was that
method of reading literature

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.389
that was determining how people
were reading in classrooms,

00:38:36.389 --> 00:38:39.243
how all those new college
students were reading in

00:38:39.243 --> 00:38:42.947
classrooms.
That set the agenda for what

00:38:42.947 --> 00:38:47.896
would come next,
so in that context someone like

00:38:47.896 --> 00:38:52.624
John Barth,
trained intensively in the New

00:38:52.624 --> 00:38:59.458
Criticism, had to decide what he
was going to do as a literarily

00:38:59.458 --> 00:39:04.933
ambitious writer to innovate.
So, it was a question of,

00:39:04.933 --> 00:39:09.099
how could literature carry on
and do something new?

00:39:09.099 --> 00:39:11.150
And there are lots of different
answers to that.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:16.128
And another answer to it,
that is partly the result of

00:39:16.128 --> 00:39:19.360
the GI Bill explosion of
education,

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.995
that's the changing demographic
of who gets to read and who gets

00:39:22.995 --> 00:39:25.693
to write.
So, women, people of color,

00:39:25.693 --> 00:39:30.433
begin to change the agendas of
modernism simply by getting that

00:39:30.433 --> 00:39:33.719
education and entering into the
academy.

00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:35.670
So, Toni Morrison is a great
example of that.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:40.144
So is Maxine Hong Kingston.
There was this sense that

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:45.736
modernism had not even begun to
touch on the experience of vast

00:39:45.736 --> 00:39:50.611
swaths of society,
and writers like Morrison and

00:39:50.611 --> 00:39:55.650
Kingston were very busy wanting
to rectify that.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.785
So, it marks a change that's
beyond just a change in

00:39:59.785 --> 00:40:02.177
readership.
The demographic change in

00:40:02.177 --> 00:40:05.066
readership and in education
really begins to change the

00:40:05.066 --> 00:40:10.880
agenda of literature.
So, that's why '45 is my marker.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.579
It's a crude one,
like all these things.

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:16.250
You can't say,
"Well, why not 1942?"

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.550
It doesn't quite work that
specifically.

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:25.973
Okay.
Other questions about the

00:40:25.973 --> 00:40:32.300
course, about terms,
about books.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.512
Yes.
Student:

00:40:33.512 --> 00:40:35.230
Of the novels you read,
what are your favorite ones?

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:37.820
I know you have them,
too.Professor Amy

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.720
Hungerford: You do,
do you?

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.979
Gosh.
That's really,

00:40:43.979 --> 00:40:46.030
really hard.
I do love The Known World.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:49.848
I really admire it.
I think it's genuinely doing

00:40:49.848 --> 00:40:53.155
something new,
and that's hard to do right

00:40:53.155 --> 00:40:53.720
now;

00:40:57.019 --> 00:40:58.329
so I love it,
and I loved it as a reading

00:40:58.329 --> 00:40:59.639
experience, even when I first
read it.

00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:01.889
It really captured my
imagination.

00:41:01.889 --> 00:41:05.440
I have always loved and hated
Blood Meridian.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.559
I love and hate Cormac
McCarthy.

00:41:07.559 --> 00:41:10.713
I've spent a lot of time
thinking about him,

00:41:10.713 --> 00:41:13.500
writing about him,
reading his work,

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:20.004
and while I am really in awe of
his ability especially to use

00:41:20.004 --> 00:41:25.099
the far reaches of our
vocabulary in English.

00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:30.010
Talk about someone who really
makes room in the language.

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:34.568
He can really do that.
If you read the first few pages

00:41:34.568 --> 00:41:38.762
of one of his earlier novels,
Suttree, you get a

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:42.355
fantastic image of this.
It's a very Joycean novel,

00:41:42.355 --> 00:41:45.040
that one.
The vocabulary-- You just have

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.016
to look up every third word.
It's really incredible.And

00:41:49.016 --> 00:41:52.565
I'm really interested in the way
he is focused on craft,

00:41:52.565 --> 00:41:55.469
both as a writer,
but all kinds of crafts.

00:41:55.469 --> 00:41:59.039
He has this play called The
Last Stonemason.

00:41:59.039 --> 00:42:02.186
I think it's called The
Last Stonemason or just

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.389
The Stonemason.
The Stonemason.

00:42:04.389 --> 00:42:08.785
He's interested in these
old arts, physical arts like

00:42:08.785 --> 00:42:12.073
forging.
There's a great chapter on

00:42:12.073 --> 00:42:17.368
smithing in a novel called
The Child of God where

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:23.049
the language of the smithy is
folded into this meditation on

00:42:23.049 --> 00:42:26.741
aesthetics,
talks about what color the fire

00:42:26.741 --> 00:42:30.696
and the metal should be at every
moment of reforging an ax

00:42:30.696 --> 00:42:33.590
handle.
Of course, in true McCarthy

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:38.480
style, the ax handle will then
be used to chop up dead bodies

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.066
and skin people,
so that's very McCarthyesque

00:42:42.066 --> 00:42:44.761
too.
But at the same time I just

00:42:44.761 --> 00:42:49.620
find him frustratingly empty.
The Road I adored.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.147
It was a terrifying read.
I had insomnia one night,

00:42:53.147 --> 00:42:56.681
and I started to read it at
about 1:30 in the morning,

00:42:56.681 --> 00:43:00.150
and I finished it about 5:30
and I was terrified.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:04.320
Have I told you about The
Road, what it's about?

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.756
It takes place ten years into a
nuclear winter,

00:43:07.756 --> 00:43:12.014
and it's about a father and son
making their way down from

00:43:12.014 --> 00:43:16.063
Appalachia to the Gulf Coast,
for no apparent reason except

00:43:16.063 --> 00:43:19.393
that the father seems to think
that somehow they'll be able to

00:43:19.393 --> 00:43:21.849
survive better once they get to
the coast.

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:25.569
Meanwhile, in this world,
there are all these

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:28.949
cannibalistic gangs that have
started.

00:43:28.949 --> 00:43:33.099
Women are used to produce
babies that they then eat.

00:43:33.099 --> 00:43:36.858
It's really completely bleak
and terrifying and the

00:43:36.858 --> 00:43:40.992
relationship between the father
and the son is extremely

00:43:40.992 --> 00:43:43.836
touching,
and I have a little boy who is

00:43:43.836 --> 00:43:47.072
about the same age and oh,
my God, I was just--it was

00:43:47.072 --> 00:43:50.805
really terrifying to read this
all alone in the middle of the

00:43:50.805 --> 00:43:53.471
night.
I sort of got in bed with my

00:43:53.471 --> 00:43:57.293
son later and just kind of
cuddled with him to remember

00:43:57.293 --> 00:44:03.929
that he was still alive.But,
at the end, there is this sense

00:44:03.929 --> 00:44:09.228
of the boy carrying the light.
The father says,

00:44:09.228 --> 00:44:13.670
"We're carrying the light.
We're the good guys."

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.559
And the son sort of repeats
that.

00:44:15.559 --> 00:44:18.549
By the end--and I won't tell
you what happens 'cause you

00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:21.920
should read it--but there is
this affirmation of that light,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.059
but what the light is,
who knows?

00:44:24.059 --> 00:44:26.780
There is sort of a Promethean
narrative there.

00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:29.269
There is also a messianic
narrative there.

00:44:29.269 --> 00:44:32.187
I think, personally,
my own meaning of it,

00:44:32.187 --> 00:44:35.959
is that it's McCarthy
meditating on the end of his own

00:44:35.959 --> 00:44:38.510
life.
McCarthy is a very old man with

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.222
a very young son,
and I think he was thinking

00:44:41.222 --> 00:44:45.051
about his own death.
And the fate of the father in

00:44:45.051 --> 00:44:49.126
that novel, I think,
is very much about McCarthy's

00:44:49.126 --> 00:44:52.962
sense of himself.
So yeah, McCarthy is a tough

00:44:52.962 --> 00:44:55.262
one.
Marilynne Robinson I like a

00:44:55.262 --> 00:44:58.829
lot also.
I like the beauty of her prose.

00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:02.893
That biblical cadence that she
and McCarthy both have I really

00:45:02.893 --> 00:45:05.010
like.
I love the outdoor imagery,

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:07.150
the nature imagery,
of that novel.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:14.670
And I love Roth for my own
obscure and perverse reasons.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:18.108
Yeah.
So I sort of have my favorites,

00:45:18.108 --> 00:45:22.056
but I like them--I,
really, there are things that I

00:45:22.056 --> 00:45:26.163
like about all of them.
An interesting story about

00:45:26.163 --> 00:45:28.769
liking novels:
I hated Salinger.

00:45:28.769 --> 00:45:32.676
I really hated Salinger,
because I found him so

00:45:32.676 --> 00:45:36.399
pretentious and affected.
I just hated that tone of

00:45:36.399 --> 00:45:39.888
voice, until I was working on
this book on religion and I read

00:45:39.888 --> 00:45:43.148
Franny and Zooey.
And here you can tell most

00:45:43.148 --> 00:45:46.579
of my great thought happens in
the middle of the night.

00:45:46.579 --> 00:45:48.713
So, I had been thinking about
Franny and Zooey,

00:45:48.713 --> 00:45:50.694
and I suddenly woke up in
the middle of the night

00:45:50.694 --> 00:45:52.816
thinking,
"I know what style is for in

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:56.245
Franny and Zooey!"
So, I got up and I wrote it

00:45:56.245 --> 00:45:58.691
down,
and that lecture that I gave on

00:45:58.691 --> 00:46:01.760
Franny and Zooey is part
of my new book.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:06.489
And when the book was reviewed
for presses, a part of it,

00:46:06.489 --> 00:46:11.303
one of my readers said it was
the best reading he had ever

00:46:11.303 --> 00:46:16.571
seen of contemporary fiction.
And it made me love Franny

00:46:16.571 --> 00:46:21.620
and Zooey 'cause suddenly I
had something to think about

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.300
other than well,
this is so pretentious.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:30.119
I had a reason why that tone
and that style was there.

00:46:30.119 --> 00:46:34.476
So, thinking about books can
really change your sense of

00:46:34.476 --> 00:46:38.516
whether you like them or not in
a self--I know--in a

00:46:38.516 --> 00:46:41.950
self-serving way.
Now who's pretentious?

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.640
Okay.
Other questions.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.763
Oh, yes.
Student:

00:46:50.763 --> 00:46:53.334
I really love Toni
Morrison's novel Beloved,

00:46:53.334 --> 00:46:55.285
and I was talking to my
roommate about it,

00:46:55.285 --> 00:46:57.380
wondering why it isn't on the
syllabus.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:00.928
I know it's taught in American
literature courses,

00:47:00.928 --> 00:47:03.389
but he thought it might be
like,

00:47:03.389 --> 00:47:07.054
academic snobbery,
because it's popular,

00:47:07.054 --> 00:47:12.598
and Oprah Winfrey talks about
it…Professor Amy

00:47:12.598 --> 00:47:15.699
Hungerford: Oh,
no, not at all.

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:18.265
I used to teach
Beloved, and I

00:47:18.265 --> 00:47:21.367
stopped because of that,
because we put it on the 127

00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:24.811
syllabus, partly.
And that wasn't here when I

00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:28.360
first started teaching;
so, the first time I offered

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.590
this lecture course,
127 didn't exist.

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.635
And then we put it in place in
the department,

00:47:33.635 --> 00:47:37.019
and because it was on that
syllabus, I held off.

00:47:37.019 --> 00:47:40.570
I still think Beloved is
an amazing novel.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.769
I also have the length problem
in that part of the period.

00:47:43.769 --> 00:47:48.102
I'm sure you didn't notice that
the novels are long in that part

00:47:48.102 --> 00:47:51.277
of the syllabus.
Beloved is another

00:47:51.277 --> 00:47:54.610
really huge novel,
so that it's a problem.

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:56.796
So, I decided instead of
putting it on,

00:47:56.796 --> 00:48:00.306
to rely on the fact that most
people would either have read it

00:48:00.306 --> 00:48:03.331
in high school,
or at least a majority would

00:48:03.331 --> 00:48:07.126
have read it in high school,
or in 127, and that I could

00:48:07.126 --> 00:48:11.150
count on that knowledge,
at least in a contextual sense.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.150
But no, it has nothing to do
with academic snobbery.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:17.245
Now, I used to get pissed off
because when it was on the

00:48:17.245 --> 00:48:21.096
syllabus I would always get,
certain evaluations would come

00:48:21.096 --> 00:48:23.790
in and say, "I don't know why we
read Beloved.

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:27.431
It's so overrated."
That was the snobbery,

00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:30.255
and that made me upset 'cause I
thought well,

00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:33.400
that's just a failure of
openness as a reader,

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.834
not to think about why it was
so powerful, even if you don't

00:48:36.834 --> 00:48:40.380
like it yourself.
But, your answer was right.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.986
It's simply because it's taught
a lot elsewhere,

00:48:43.986 --> 00:48:47.900
and then those other practical
reasons of length.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.621
What else?
Uh huh.Student:

00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:52.989
Are there authors that you
would have included,

00:48:52.989 --> 00:48:55.263
if it were a longer
semester.Professor Amy

00:48:55.263 --> 00:48:58.370
Hungerford: Oh.
Well, I'm sure, yeah.

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:01.700
So, let's see.
What else would I put on there?

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:07.803
Well, let me think.
Louise Erdrich is interesting

00:49:07.803 --> 00:49:09.715
to me.
There is a long novel of hers

00:49:09.715 --> 00:49:12.830
called The Last Report on the
Miracles at Little No Horse,

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:15.270
which I think is an
imaginative conceit.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:19.142
It is really fascinating.
The premise of the novel is,

00:49:19.142 --> 00:49:24.377
it's this young woman who is a
wonderfully gifted pianist who

00:49:24.377 --> 00:49:28.389
goes--I can't remember where
she's heading.

00:49:28.389 --> 00:49:30.239
It's been now a long time since
I read the novel.

00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:34.176
She's traveling,
and she gets washed away in a

00:49:34.176 --> 00:49:38.309
flood, a freak flood of a river.
This is out West.

00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:43.041
And, when she finally surfaces,
she crawls up on the bank,

00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:47.856
and she finds the body of a
young priest who was on his way

00:49:47.856 --> 00:49:52.090
to be the priest at a mission on
a reservation,

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:56.809
on an Indian reservation,
I think, in the Dakotas.

00:49:56.809 --> 00:50:00.915
So, she cuts off her hair,
and she puts on the priest's

00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:04.260
robes, and she pretends to be
that priest.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.397
And she becomes--she
cross-dresses and is the priest

00:50:07.397 --> 00:50:09.920
at the reservation for her
entire life.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.550
And I just think it's a
fascinating premise for a novel,

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:19.769
and it's very well done and her
language is quite wonderful.

00:50:19.769 --> 00:50:23.846
Again, I am ambivalent about
it, because I find the ending

00:50:23.846 --> 00:50:26.819
facile.
It finally resolves all the

00:50:26.819 --> 00:50:31.822
problems that this situation
produces in a way that I don't

00:50:31.822 --> 00:50:35.789
find complex enough,
or challenging enough.

00:50:35.789 --> 00:50:39.644
It's just too easy to make it
all come together the way she

00:50:39.644 --> 00:50:41.790
does.
So, that's one.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:46.620
Let me think.
There are many,

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.633
many other novels.
I'm perpetually torn whether to

00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:52.486
put The Road on,
or Blood Meridian,

00:50:52.486 --> 00:50:54.500
or some other McCarthy
novel.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:51:01.023
I've taught at least four
different Roth novels spanning

00:51:01.023 --> 00:51:05.530
the period from 1960 to the
present.

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:09.750
Other writers…
Now, I don't know why I'm

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.870
blanking, now that I think about
this.

00:51:17.019 --> 00:51:19.440
Who else would I like to put on
there?

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.280
Oh, Eggers.
Now I "fess up."

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:26.146
I really would have loved to do
What is the What as our

00:51:26.146 --> 00:51:29.034
last novel.
Now, Eggers started out

00:51:29.034 --> 00:51:34.421
immature, in the same way that,
I think, Jonathan Safran Foer

00:51:34.421 --> 00:51:35.922
is.
But he grew up,

00:51:35.922 --> 00:51:39.840
and it's a beautiful thing.
So, A Heartbreaking Work of

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.657
Staggering Genius has a lot
of that sort of kind of

00:51:43.657 --> 00:51:47.289
clichéd,
postmodern trickery in it,

00:51:47.289 --> 00:51:52.010
but by the time he gets to
What is the What,

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:55.510
 that novel is like
nothing else.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:59.076
There is no equivalent of that
novel, to my knowledge,

00:51:59.076 --> 00:52:02.989
anywhere in our tradition.
It's just an astonishing

00:52:02.989 --> 00:52:07.809
inhabitation of another person's
life, but in real time.

00:52:07.809 --> 00:52:12.320
I was able to have dinner with
him and some other people when

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.230
he came as the Schlesinger
writer a few years ago,

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:21.650
and I said, "Did you find it
confining to give yourself over

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:26.520
in that creative way to this
other person's story?"

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.219
And he said, "Yeah.
It was terrible.

00:52:28.219 --> 00:52:31.920
I'd be writing 'The truck went
down the road.'"

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.197
He'd have to call Valentino and
say, "Valentino,

00:52:36.197 --> 00:52:40.840
that truck--was the road
gravel, or was it paved?

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.063
And was it dusty?
Was there stuff kicking up,

00:52:44.063 --> 00:52:47.435
or was it just flat?"
It was just amazing,

00:52:47.435 --> 00:52:52.348
the degree to which he put his
writing pen at the service of

00:52:52.348 --> 00:52:57.003
another person and their story.
It's really remarkable,

00:52:57.003 --> 00:53:00.175
so, given that extremely
confining setup,

00:53:00.175 --> 00:53:04.139
he makes that novel truly
literary, in my mind.

00:53:04.139 --> 00:53:08.923
It has a real form,
it has a very lively voice,

00:53:08.923 --> 00:53:13.500
and it's extremely powerful and
affecting.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:15.619
So, that's something I would
love to have,

00:53:15.619 --> 00:53:18.410
but again it's a huge novel,
so this is the problem.

00:53:18.410 --> 00:53:21.267
It's so long.
I think I just need two

00:53:21.267 --> 00:53:23.180
semesters.
I think that would be better.

00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:24.280
Yes.
Student:

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.398
What about Jonathan Safran
Foer's latest

00:53:25.398 --> 00:53:26.827
book?Professor Amy
Hungerford: I haven't read

00:53:26.827 --> 00:53:30.164
it yet,
but I have to say the reviews

00:53:30.164 --> 00:53:35.692
that I hear about it--so,
was it Extremely Loud and

00:53:35.692 --> 00:53:41.532
Incredibly Close?--the
structure of the plot makes me

00:53:41.532 --> 00:53:43.737
doubt,
a little bit,

00:53:43.737 --> 00:53:49.141
because it's just another hunt.
So, it's this nine-year-old boy

00:53:49.141 --> 00:53:54.292
who loses his father on 9/11,
and he finds in his father's

00:53:54.292 --> 00:53:58.630
effects a key that's marked
"Black," I think.

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:02.436
It has a little label on it,
and so he goes around in New

00:54:02.436 --> 00:54:06.378
York City finding everyone by
the name of Black that he can

00:54:06.378 --> 00:54:08.282
find.
So, it has this structure

00:54:08.282 --> 00:54:10.920
that's so similar to
Everything is Illuminated.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.934
That hunt structure just
made me think,

00:54:14.934 --> 00:54:19.809
I wonder whether this is just a
one-trick writer,

00:54:19.809 --> 00:54:24.699
that he has this idea and this
is what it's always going to be?

00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:28.128
That doesn't necessarily mean
that someone is not a great

00:54:28.128 --> 00:54:30.654
writer.
Roth is kind of a one-trick

00:54:30.654 --> 00:54:32.409
pony, in this way,
too.

00:54:32.409 --> 00:54:37.570
He has his own repetitions from
novel to novel.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.751
Most writers I know do,
but that seemed a little

00:54:40.751 --> 00:54:44.610
too--It was a little too close
for me, so I don't know.

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.650
I have to find time to read it.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:50.659
Denis Johnson:
I did actually-- I was very

00:54:50.659 --> 00:54:53.267
interested in having Jesus'
Son as the last novel,

00:54:53.267 --> 00:54:56.006
too.
I'm going to write a review for

00:54:56.006 --> 00:55:00.511
the Yale Review on Denis
Johnson's work by the end of

00:55:00.511 --> 00:55:04.252
July, so by then I'll know what
I think about him,

00:55:04.252 --> 00:55:06.380
too.
Other questions?

00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:10.100
Or shall I let you go?
Any other questions?

00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:12.545
Okay.
So I will see you at the exam,

00:55:12.545 --> 00:55:15.553
and I think some sections are
having review sessions,

00:55:15.553 --> 00:55:17.086
so check with your TF.

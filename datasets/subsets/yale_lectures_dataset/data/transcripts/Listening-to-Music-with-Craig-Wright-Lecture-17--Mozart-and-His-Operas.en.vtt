00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.250
Prof: So--good morning.
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.379
I bring you news from
Nashville--very interesting,

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:09.880
Nashville.
 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.370
I had such an interesting
weekend.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.278
Friday night,
went to this spectacular

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:17.454
concert of Mozart,
doing the Mozart Requiem in

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:20.843
this one hundred thirty-five
million-dollar concert hall that

00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:23.667
they have put--
built for music in the city of

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:24.330
Nashville.
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.001
The next afternoon,
Saturday afternoon,

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.040
I walked across the street.
 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.070
I could have gone two blocks to
watch a hockey game--

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.560
they have a hockey team in
Nashville--

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.955
or three blocks in the other
direction to watch the Titans

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:38.863
play in the football stadium,
but I went just one block to

00:00:38.863 --> 00:00:40.650
the Country Music Hall of Fame.
 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.310
So I spent three hours in the
Country Music Hall of Fame and--

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.740
absolutely fascinating--but it
got even better,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.940
because Sunday morning,
there I was at the airport

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.030
about to fly out of Nashville.
 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.112
And I'm sitting there and you
know how you're queuing up to

00:00:56.112 --> 00:00:59.461
get--go out your gate to get on
your airplane and CNN is playing

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:00.950
on the television there.
 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.369
It was wonderful.
 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:03.460
What did I hear?
 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.500
&gt;
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.540
Ah, Mozart!
 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.579
Mozart right here in the
airport in Nashville.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.718
And then it went on from that.
 

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:25.217
There was another commercial
and they used &lt;&lt;plays

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.980
piano &gt;&gt;
 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.200
and so on.
 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.748
So what a strange,
wonderful world,

00:01:31.748 --> 00:01:35.120
what a strange,
wonderful country to have such

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.019
diversity ethnically,
politically and musically.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:42.830
And at the same time to have a
sense that this little person

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.060
who was only about five feet
three inches tall--

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.650
probably weighed about one
hundred ten pounds--

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.470
sitting in a room in Vienna,
Austria,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.799
more than two hundred years ago
could create this beauty that we

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.602
still engage today,
whether consciously or

00:01:59.602 --> 00:02:01.813
subconsciously,
when we're sitting in an

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:03.733
airport in Nashville,
Tennessee.

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:04.290
Right?
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.878
Astonishing what the brain
sometimes experiences.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:10.968
Well, today we're going to talk
about Mozart.

00:02:10.968 --> 00:02:38.735
Now the music that you just
heard--&lt;&lt;music

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:48.780
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.101
Okay.
 

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:52.702
Let's just stop it there,
and we're going to come back to

00:02:52.702 --> 00:02:54.310
this in just a second.
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.280
It's music of the Classical
period.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.729
It's music of Mozart.
 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.400
It happens to be what's called
his "Little G Minor

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.626
Symphony,"
and contrast that to the music

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:05.050
that you heard in section last
week by Bach,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:15.628
&gt;
 

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:20.657
and so on where he gets a
concerto going,

00:03:20.657 --> 00:03:23.550
&gt;
 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.919
and it sort of chugs along in
that same fashion,

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.849
chugs along,
in fact, for about nine minutes

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:32.940
and twenty seconds all with the
music having the same general

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.919
tenor,
the same general mood,

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.710
the same general feeling to it.
 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.910
That's Baroque music.
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.139
Once you get an ethos
established in Baroque music,

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.888
it will carry through from
beginning to end of a particular

00:03:45.888 --> 00:03:48.150
movement or a particular piece.
 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.210
It doesn't change,
generally speaking.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.810
When we get to the Classical
period,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.200
however, and here we're talking
roughly seventeen fifty up to

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.766
around eighteen twenty or so,
things get a little bit

00:03:58.766 --> 00:03:59.128
different.
 

00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:01.878
We get change within a
particular movement.

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:05.947
Change might be from regular to
irregular rhythm,

00:04:05.947 --> 00:04:09.081
for example,
or from very loud to very

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:09.930
quiet.
 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.902
And this push for change only
accelerates as we go in to the

00:04:14.902 --> 00:04:20.129
romantic period where you get
these wild swings of emotion,

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.814
these wild swings of musical
mood, a kind of bipolar music in

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:25.350
the nineteenth century.
 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.514
Well, this begins in the
Classical period so let's go

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.375
back and hear the beginning of
this Symphony No.

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.079
25 in G Minor of Mozart.
 

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:35.370
And notice here we begin minor
key,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.303
lots of syncopation,
agitation, and within about

00:04:38.303 --> 00:04:41.985
forty seconds Mozart has morphed
into a completely different

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:45.000
mood,
a major key, oboe solo.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.959
The music is very lyrical.
 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:51.685
The meter now is--or the
rhythms are all lined up to come

00:04:51.685 --> 00:04:54.279
on the beat rather than off the
beat.

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.083
Watch how we have this
transformation of mood within a

00:04:57.083 --> 00:04:58.670
rather short period of time.
 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:42.240
&gt;
 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.879
Okay, completely different sort
of music here.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.992
Now that sound that you just
heard there is the opening music

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:48.810
for the film
"Amadeus."

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.410
How many have seen the movie or
film "Amadeus"?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.480
If you haven't, go see it.
 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.779
It's just not to be believed,
it is so good.

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:57.238
And it doesn't age either,
because it's all done in period

00:05:57.238 --> 00:05:59.870
costume so you don't know that
anything has really changed.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.879
It's a wonderful movie.
 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.473
It's based on two premises:
One, what does mediocrity do in

00:06:06.473 --> 00:06:08.850
the face of absolute genius?
 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.139
And two, isn't it ironic,
isn't it somehow unfair,

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:17.689
that this God-given talent,
this great creature,

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.651
comes to earth in the form of
this sort of childish lout,

00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:23.980
i.e., Mozart?
 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.600
And we'll explore that just a
little bit.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.069
And how does someone like Peter
Shaffer,

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:32.273
who created the play and--on
which was built the film

00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:35.084
"Amadeus"--
how did they create a character

00:06:35.084 --> 00:06:35.579
like this?
 

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:38.382
Well, they use memoirs of the
time, letters of the time,

00:06:38.382 --> 00:06:40.370
primary source documents of the
time.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.940
You may remember in
"Amadeus,"--

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.459
and I put a picture of this in
the textbook because I think

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:47.194
it's actually very important in
trying to get inside of Mozart's

00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:51.363
head--
that Mozart often composed on a

00:06:51.363 --> 00:06:53.290
billiard table.
 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.850
That's what we see in
"Amadeus."

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:55.810
Is this true?
 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.720
Yes, it is actually true.
 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.660
If you look at the probate list
of Mozart--

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.670
they went through his apartment
after he died and they

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.060
inventoried all the furniture
and said where everything was--

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.079
in his bedroom he had a
billiards table--

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:09.199
not a pool table,
but a billiards table.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.601
There's an important difference
here because billiards,

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:14.430
of course, involves angles.
 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.670
And there is a report from one
of Mozart's friends,

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:21.060
a tenor, Michael Kelly,
who said in his memoirs,

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.764
"He was fond of billiards
and had an excellent billiard

00:07:24.764 --> 00:07:26.019
table in his home.
 

00:07:26.019 --> 00:07:29.247
Many and many a game I played
with him but always came off

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:30.379
second best."
 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:33.639
And Mozart had other interests
too.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.560
His--one of his other interests
was arithmetic,

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.324
and if you look at the Mozart
autographs and particularly the

00:07:41.324 --> 00:07:44.649
Mozart sketches you will see
that he fills the margins

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:47.843
oftentimes with numbers,
doing various basic

00:07:47.843 --> 00:07:51.603
calculations and sometimes some
fundamental algebraic

00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:52.759
formulations.
 

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.970
Why this fascination with
numbers and shapes and patterns?

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.619
He would go into a restaurant
and he would be seen folding his

00:08:00.619 --> 00:08:02.269
napkin this way,
this way, this way.

00:08:02.269 --> 00:08:05.240
When he writes letters he
oftentimes writes the word

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.939
backwards.
 

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:10.310
He loves anagrams and I could
give you lots of specific

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:11.930
instances of that.
 

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.889
Another aspect of this is
Mozart the mimic.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.406
Mozart had an incredible
capacity to imitate other

00:08:19.406 --> 00:08:23.209
individuals--their facial
gestures, their dialects.

00:08:23.209 --> 00:08:26.329
We can't--we don't have time to
go in to it, those dialects.

00:08:26.329 --> 00:08:27.980
And he was fluent.
 

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.300
He learned languages
lickety-split--

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.706
fluent Italian,
fluent French,

00:08:31.706 --> 00:08:35.488
fluent English,
of course in addition to his

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:38.197
native German,
and he had a great musical

00:08:38.197 --> 00:08:38.519
memory.
 

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:40.298
He could retain all of this
sound.

00:08:40.298 --> 00:08:43.083
A famous story:
He goes into the Sistine Chapel

00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:43.690
in Rome.
 

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.908
We saw pictures of that two
weeks ago.

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:49.113
He hears one piece that
couldn't be performed anywhere

00:08:49.113 --> 00:08:52.739
else, had never been published,
only supposed to be performed

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:54.190
in the Papal Chapel.
 

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.519
He goes in once,
hears it, walks back to his

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:58.740
hotel, and writes the whole
thing down.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.730
Well, what is all of this?
 

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:09.011
Well, it's the capacity,
I suppose--what is the brain

00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:11.720
doing up there?
 

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.706
We've got this organ,
probably the least understood,

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:17.460
and we have these various parts
of the brain.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.769
Sound processing--for music,
sound processing for language--

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.428
is happening mostly in the
temporal lobe,

00:09:23.428 --> 00:09:27.344
but engaging various kinds of
near-term and long-term memory

00:09:27.344 --> 00:09:32.551
in the frontal lobe,
and probably in the hippocampus

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.620
as well.
 

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.956
If you have absolute pitch,
sometimes you short-circuit,

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:42.764
apparently, this whole process
because that's being recognized

00:09:42.764 --> 00:09:45.210
in the brainstem and so on.
 

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.770
So there's lots going on here,
and I've given you this sheet

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.232
in which a Yale neuroscientist,
David Ross--a couple of years

00:09:54.232 --> 00:09:57.774
ago--he was the basis of an
article in the Yale Alumni

00:09:57.774 --> 00:09:59.988
magazine:
"Is Your Brain In

00:09:59.988 --> 00:10:01.000
Tune?"
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.596
and it talks about things such
as the incidence of absolute

00:10:05.596 --> 00:10:11.537
pitch in this world;
roughly one person in every ten

00:10:11.537 --> 00:10:13.840
thousand has it.
 

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.835
So these are the kinds of
things that interest about

00:10:17.835 --> 00:10:18.538
Mozart.
 

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:21.840
Oddly, we can--we know more
about Mozart than we know about

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.408
Picasso.
 

00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:26.070
Picasso lived--a great artist,
a great genius here--in the

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.408
twentieth century,
died about 1973,1970-something.

00:10:29.408 --> 00:10:32.907
But we can get inside of
Mozart's head more intensely and

00:10:32.907 --> 00:10:36.778
we know more about him than we
can about Picasso because Mozart

00:10:36.778 --> 00:10:38.590
left us a ton of letters.
 

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.339
I just grabbed something that
was on my bookshelf in my office

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.179
here,
here--volume two of a

00:10:43.179 --> 00:10:45.928
five-volume set of letters by
Mozart,

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:47.788
so he was always writing
letters to,

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:50.500
principally,
his father, and it's on the

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:54.673
basis of this kind of thing that
we get a sense of who Mozart

00:10:54.673 --> 00:10:55.230
was.
 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.881
The portrayal of Mozart in
"Amadeus,"

00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:01.820
as I say, is just absolutely
wrong.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.288
It couldn't be more wrong.
 

00:11:03.288 --> 00:11:06.076
The movie is brilliant,
the premise is brilliant,

00:11:06.076 --> 00:11:09.620
but the portrayal of Mozart
couldn't be more off the track.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.966
Here is just one letter from
those in the collected letters

00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:16.740
of Mozart that always interests
me.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.693
He's writing to his father,
1787, about the time of the

00:11:19.693 --> 00:11:21.610
death of one of his good
friends.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.865
The friend was named Count von
Hatzfeld and this is what Mozart

00:11:25.865 --> 00:11:27.168
says about death.
 

00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:31.115
"Death is the true goal of
our lives and I have made myself

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:34.748
so well acquainted with it
during the past two years that I

00:11:34.748 --> 00:11:37.879
see it as the true and best
friend of mankind.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:41.195
Indeed, the idea of it no
longer holds any terror for me

00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:44.269
but rather much that is tranquil
and comforting,

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:47.711
and I thank God that he has
granted me the good fortune to

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:50.971
obtain the opportunity of
regarding death as the key to

00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:52.360
our true happiness.
 

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.070
I never retire at night without
considering that,

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.413
as young as I am,
perhaps I may be no more on the

00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:01.011
morrow,
yet not one of those who knows

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:03.928
me could say that I am morose or
melancholy,

00:12:03.928 --> 00:12:08.158
and for this I thank my creator
daily and wish heartily the same

00:12:08.158 --> 00:12:10.980
happiness may be given to my
fellow man.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.222
I clearly explained my way of
looking at the matter on the

00:12:14.222 --> 00:12:17.010
occasion of the death of my very
dear best friend,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.320
Count von Hatzfeld.
 

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.940
He was just thirty-one like
myself.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.057
I do not grieve for him but
from the bottom of my heart for

00:12:25.057 --> 00:12:28.820
myself and for all who knew him
as well as I."

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.702
Now ironically,
at age thirty-one how many more

00:12:31.702 --> 00:12:34.210
years did Mozart himself have to
live?

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:35.208
Yeah, four.
 

00:12:35.208 --> 00:12:38.298
He did not make it to
thirty-six.

00:12:38.298 --> 00:12:40.873
He wrote this &lt;&lt;extends
arms&gt;&gt; --if you go on our

00:12:40.873 --> 00:12:43.446
music library over there and you
could extend your hands like

00:12:43.446 --> 00:12:46.104
this and you would not be able
to encompass all of the music by

00:12:46.104 --> 00:12:50.835
Mozart that's been edited,
and he did all of that by the

00:12:50.835 --> 00:12:53.580
time he was thirty-six.
 

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.129
So Mozart's an interesting
character.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:13:00.019
He may have had no formal
education, didn't spend a minute

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:00.840
in school.
 

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.070
Why not?
 

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:06.129
 
 

00:13:06.129 --> 00:13:08.157
Well, they didn't have
mandatory education in that

00:13:08.157 --> 00:13:08.528
period.
 

00:13:08.528 --> 00:13:12.301
He was recognized very early on
to be a musical genius and his

00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:15.485
father nourished him at home,
took him all around the world

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:18.500
to showcase these talents,
and he was sort of educated as

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.080
a person in the world and his
father did teach him many,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.269
many things as he went through
life.

00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.736
Okay.
 

00:13:26.736 --> 00:13:30.480
So what kind of music did
Mozart write?

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.259
What's special about Mozart's
music?

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:37.080
Well, let me try to encapsulate
this in a simple way by saying

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.663
let's focus on four things that
are peculiar about Mozart's

00:13:41.663 --> 00:13:45.220
music or individual about
Mozart's music.

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.515
The first: I would say,
this infallible sense of

00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:50.269
balance and proportion.
 

00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:54.979
Yes, we are in the Classical
period in the history of music

00:13:54.979 --> 00:13:59.038
and that's why we call it the
Classical period,

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:02.200
because everything does seem to
be in balance.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.144
There's not an excessive degree
of ornamentation the way you

00:14:05.144 --> 00:14:07.539
find in--sometimes in Baroque
art for example.

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:08.850
Everything is balanced.
 

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.200
And it is still the norm today.
 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.238
I was dumbfounded looking at
that new concert hall in

00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:14.940
Nashville.
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:15.879
What did they do?
 

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:19.316
They--it's a knockoff of the
U.S. Treasury building or the

00:14:19.316 --> 00:14:21.969
Federal Reserve building in
Washington, D.C.,

00:14:21.969 --> 00:14:25.586
you know, the basic pediment up
there, the columns and all of

00:14:25.586 --> 00:14:26.370
this.
 

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.000
That's architecture,
everything in perfect balance.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.985
Well, in Classical music we
begin to get this for the first

00:14:31.985 --> 00:14:33.840
time here in the Classical
period.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.011
Remember when we were studying
measures and bars and phrases

00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:40.769
and I would have you count
measures,

00:14:40.769 --> 00:14:44.538
and invariably we would find
that things are two plus two,

00:14:44.538 --> 00:14:46.381
four plus four,
eight plus eight and that kind

00:14:46.381 --> 00:14:47.570
of thing, very symmetrical.
 

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.123
Well, this comes in to music
here for the first time in a big

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:52.899
way in the Classical period.
 

00:14:52.899 --> 00:14:54.529
So let's just refresh our
memory here.

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:59.336
Here is the aria "Voi che
sapete" by Mozart which we

00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:03.684
had Lauren Libaw sing for us--
but just the beginning of it to

00:15:03.684 --> 00:15:07.043
get a sense in our ears once
again what's an antecedent in

00:15:07.043 --> 00:15:08.279
consequent phrase.
 

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:14.950
&gt;
 

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:22.370
Antecedent, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:26.019
consequent, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:30.178
antecedent, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:15:30.178 --> 00:15:41.440
three, opens it up and inserts,
&gt;

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:50.110
now the consequence,
&gt;.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.325
Okay.
 

00:15:50.325 --> 00:15:52.828
We'll just stop it right there,
but everything in four plus

00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:55.118
four and you can go right
through that entire aria and

00:15:55.118 --> 00:15:56.370
it's organized that way.
 

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.005
All right.
 

00:15:57.005 --> 00:15:59.360
So that's point one:
balance, shaping,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.759
perfect proportion.
 

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:05.236
Point two: The capacity to make
something very beautiful out of

00:16:05.236 --> 00:16:07.259
the simplest of materials.
 

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:10.769
It's sort of oxymoron here with
Mozart.

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:15.340
The--sometimes the simpler it
is, the more beautiful it is.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.817
Here is the piece they were
playing in the airport in

00:16:18.817 --> 00:16:19.620
Nashville.
 

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.629
It's out of a piano concerto of
Mozart.

00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:26.788
It's the one in C major that's
listed on your sheet there .

00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.960
It's called the "Elvira
Madigan"

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.443
concerto because a few years
ago they used it as background

00:16:34.443 --> 00:16:38.225
music for a movie that--
a film that was based on a

00:16:38.225 --> 00:16:38.659
novel.
 

00:16:38.659 --> 00:16:40.250
Thomas Hardy--is that right?
 

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.639
"Elvira Madigan"?
 

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:43.840
I think that's correct.
 

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.220
In any event, here is the music.
 

00:16:45.220 --> 00:17:08.259
&gt;
 

00:17:08.259 --> 00:17:08.738
And so on.
 

00:17:08.738 --> 00:17:11.516
I'm going to just stop there
for a second and let's look at

00:17:11.516 --> 00:17:11.900
this.
 

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.940
&gt;
 

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.730
What's that?
 

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.630
Somebody yell it out nice and
loud.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:23.400
&gt;
 

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.608
Daniel?
 

00:17:24.608 --> 00:17:27.500
Daniel says major triad,
absolutely right.

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.319
So he is just ornamenting it a
little bit.

00:17:29.319 --> 00:17:31.410
&gt;
 

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.170
Now what's this?
 

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:35.568
&gt;
 

00:17:35.568 --> 00:17:36.173
Just a scale.
 

00:17:36.173 --> 00:17:38.406
He's up on the fifth,
&gt;

00:17:38.406 --> 00:17:39.848
five, four, three,
two, one.

00:17:39.848 --> 00:17:43.693
He makes it a little more
interesting by doing this,

00:17:43.693 --> 00:17:45.880
&gt;
 

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.787
a little chromaticism inserted
there, so the stuff we talked

00:17:48.787 --> 00:17:50.660
about at the beginning of the
class.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:52.750
Triad, goes up,
comes down the scale,

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:55.771
goes in--the triad coming down
the scale, a chromatic

00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:58.269
inflection, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:17:58.269 --> 00:18:08.108
the next phrase,
&gt;

00:18:08.108 --> 00:18:11.414
gets back to the opening idea,
but how does he do that?

00:18:11.414 --> 00:18:13.190
&gt;
 

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.534
This is an interesting chord
and we should focus on it just

00:18:16.534 --> 00:18:17.400
for a minute.
 

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.269
It's called a dominant seventh
chord.

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:23.720
Here's our basic C major triad,
C, E, G, &gt;

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.910
and it's made up of two thirds.
 

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:30.358
If we put one more third up
there, &gt;

00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:34.348
that would get us up to a
seventh chord.

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:35.740
Why is it called a seventh
chord, again?

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.190
Because it spans seven letter
names, C, D, E,

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:40.210
F, G, A, B.
 

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.848
So a total of seven letter
names up there.

00:18:42.848 --> 00:18:47.968
But it's simply a triad with
another third thrown up there on

00:18:47.968 --> 00:18:48.480
top.
 

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.920
So we get that idea.
 

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:57.380
&gt;
 

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.578
Back to the tonic,
&gt;

00:19:01.578 --> 00:19:05.750
continue, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:16.430
diminished chord,
&gt;

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:21.190
and throws a little trill
on--at the end and that's it,

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.372
but it's very,
very simple material but it's

00:19:23.372 --> 00:19:26.468
so beautiful and so lasting that
you can hear it once again in

00:19:26.468 --> 00:19:27.940
the airport in Nashville.
 

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:28.942
All right.
 

00:19:28.942 --> 00:19:32.657
Point three:
what I would say are wild

00:19:32.657 --> 00:19:35.670
swings of mood with Mozart.
 

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:37.853
It begins to come in,
as mentioned,

00:19:37.853 --> 00:19:41.192
in the Classical period,
this change of mood within a

00:19:41.192 --> 00:19:42.670
single composition.
 

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.490
But with Mozart it's
particularly intense,

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:48.465
because he likes to swing
really quickly between major and

00:19:48.465 --> 00:19:51.547
minor keys and he likes to go
between diatonic and chromatic

00:19:51.547 --> 00:19:52.538
really quickly.
 

00:19:52.538 --> 00:19:56.413
And he likes to play off
different dynamic levels,

00:19:56.413 --> 00:19:57.680
loud and soft.
 

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.377
And that's the essence of
drama, right,

00:20:00.377 --> 00:20:01.869
contrast, conflict.
 

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:03.880
That's where we get drama.
 

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.294
So let's listen to a bit of the
"Confutatis"

00:20:07.294 --> 00:20:08.970
out of the Requiem Mass.
 

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.154
We talked a bit about this a
little bit before but it

00:20:11.154 --> 00:20:13.592
wouldn't hurt to hear it again
so we're going to start here

00:20:13.592 --> 00:20:15.400
down low in &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.519
demon land in minor,
agitation, and then we'll shift

00:20:19.519 --> 00:20:22.509
up in to the higher heavenly
realm.

00:20:22.509 --> 00:20:24.450
&gt;
 

00:20:24.450 --> 00:21:09.068
 
 

00:21:09.068 --> 00:21:22.294
Now we're going to go to the
Confutatis out of the Dies Irae

00:21:22.294 --> 00:21:33.950
of the Requiem Mass,
&gt;

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:49.180
completely new environment,
&gt;

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:50.960
and then back to the original.
 

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:58.670
&gt;
 

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:01.910
So that's point three:
strong contrast.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.730
And sometimes rather abrupt
contrast .

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.190
And here is the fourth and
final point: Inexhaustible

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:10.118
melodic supply,
fecundity of imagination when

00:22:10.118 --> 00:22:11.650
it comes to melody.
 

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.548
This is an interesting thing.
 

00:22:13.548 --> 00:22:16.140
It's something I'm studying in
my own work at the moment,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.990
looking at a lot of Mozart's
sketches.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.450
And Mozart sometimes would have
to sketch something.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.426
He'd sometimes get in a little
bit of trouble and have to write

00:22:22.426 --> 00:22:22.808
something.
 

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:24.932
For the most part,
he had it all in his head--he

00:22:24.932 --> 00:22:27.643
was just writing it down--but
sometimes he did have to sketch

00:22:27.643 --> 00:22:28.140
things.
 

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:32.743
When he gets in trouble and has
to sketch it's contrapuntal

00:22:32.743 --> 00:22:34.568
issues, never melody.
 

00:22:34.568 --> 00:22:38.277
Now you look at Beethoven's
sketches in the Beethoven sketch

00:22:38.277 --> 00:22:42.298
books and Beethoven will wrestle
with trying to craft or get this

00:22:42.298 --> 00:22:46.069
melody exactly the way he wants
it over and over again,

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:47.598
erasure after erasure.
 

00:22:47.598 --> 00:22:51.434
When you look at the Beethoven
section of the textbook there,

00:22:51.434 --> 00:22:55.016
there's a facsimile of--out of
the second movement of the

00:22:55.016 --> 00:22:56.868
Beethoven Fifth Symphony.
 

00:22:56.868 --> 00:22:59.880
Notice all the erasures there
and the constant corrections.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.470
It took him about twenty years
before he was happy with

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:07.058
&lt;&lt;plays piano,
"Ode to Joy"&gt;&gt;.

00:23:07.058 --> 00:23:10.375
He worked on that thing for a
long, long time before he got it

00:23:10.375 --> 00:23:10.808
exact.
 

00:23:10.808 --> 00:23:11.970
That would never happen with
Mozart.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.210
This just flowed perfectly.
 

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.028
Now we're going to play an
example here.

00:23:16.028 --> 00:23:20.509
I've never used this in any
kind of public forum before.

00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:22.528
I'd be interested to see how it
comes across.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:26.594
It's an example of Mozart
writing church music for a

00:23:26.594 --> 00:23:27.788
soprano solo.
 

00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:31.074
Actually, the soprano that had
to sing it was his wife so she

00:23:31.074 --> 00:23:32.058
was pretty good.
 

00:23:32.058 --> 00:23:33.717
So let's just listen to a chunk
out of a mass,

00:23:33.717 --> 00:23:35.079
the &lt;&lt;"Et in
carnatus"

00:23:35.079 --> 00:23:35.779
of the &gt;&gt;
 

00:23:35.779 --> 00:23:40.193
C Minor Mass by Mozart,
and see this sense of melody

00:23:40.193 --> 00:23:44.608
that just is perfect and can
just kind of go on--

00:23:44.608 --> 00:23:47.960
perfectly shaped,
perfectly proportioned,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.230
but you don't have a sense that
he's struggling with this.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.349
It just seems so easy.
 

00:23:52.349 --> 00:24:05.069
&gt;
 

00:24:05.069 --> 00:24:11.660
 
 

00:24:11.660 --> 00:25:44.269
&gt;
 

00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:46.269
Okay. We'll just pause it there.
 

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:47.680
We're just breaking in the
middle of it.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.910
This guy could go on forever
with this kind of thing and

00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.288
sometimes it got him in trouble.
 

00:25:51.288 --> 00:25:55.843
What I mean by that is that
there are two famous anecdotes

00:25:55.843 --> 00:25:59.105
coming from Mozart's life,
one at the time of the

00:25:59.105 --> 00:26:01.430
production of The Abduction
from the Seraglio.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.900
The emperor is there and the
emperor says,

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:05.940
"All well and good,
my dear friend Mozart,

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:09.940
but far too many notes,"
and Mozart's repose--

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.180
response was,
"Not one nor--

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:18.750
no more or less than absolutely
necessary,

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:19.980
Your Majesty."
 

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:22.940
Then, at the end of the
performance,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.230
first Viennese performance of
Don Giovanni,

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:27.019
the emperor,
same emperor,

00:26:27.019 --> 00:26:29.875
Joseph II,
said, "Too much meat for

00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:32.893
the teeth of my Viennese,
dear Mozart,"

00:26:32.893 --> 00:26:35.338
to which the repost this time
was,

00:26:35.338 --> 00:26:37.240
"Well, let them chew on it
a while.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.480
They'll get used to it."
 

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.669
And they did and--get used to
it but unfortunately by that

00:26:42.669 --> 00:26:44.358
time Mozart was dead.
 

00:26:44.358 --> 00:26:50.403
So he didn't live to see the
success of his particular

00:26:50.403 --> 00:26:51.430
vision.
 

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:56.141
So with Mozart there is this
sense of music that is divinely

00:26:56.141 --> 00:26:58.180
shaped,
divinely proportioned,

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:01.315
a sort of endless variety,
not one note too many,

00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:02.868
not one note too few.
 

00:27:02.868 --> 00:27:06.609
And indeed in his day Mozart
was referred to as "the

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:08.078
divine Mozart."
 

00:27:08.078 --> 00:27:09.470
We still call him "the
divine Mozart."

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:13.743
It's interesting what labels
get put on particular composers,

00:27:13.743 --> 00:27:17.519
Bach for example--I'm not sure
we call Bach divine.

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:22.096
We call him the stalwart Bach,
the industrious Bach for

00:27:22.096 --> 00:27:27.096
example, Beethoven the powerful,
Bach the powerful composer,

00:27:27.096 --> 00:27:29.298
the striving composer.
 

00:27:29.298 --> 00:27:35.258
I can sort of relate to Bach in
a way with his twenty children

00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:38.578
or with Beethoven and the chaos.
 

00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:41.920
You look at a Beethoven score
and it's this train wreck,

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.398
that he's scribbled here,
always trying to correct this

00:27:44.398 --> 00:27:47.509
and wrote this out and then he--
his dinner falls over top of

00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:50.108
the manuscript so he's got to
sweep that away.

00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:52.538
It's just his whole life kind
of chaotic there,

00:27:52.538 --> 00:27:55.960
but with Mozart it's all sort
of crystal clear and crisp,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:28:00.798
perfectly organized almost from
the get-go in these autographed

00:28:00.798 --> 00:28:03.993
scores,
and that's what we mean sort of

00:28:03.993 --> 00:28:06.720
by the divine nature of the
music.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.818
It's sort of heavenly sent
music.

00:28:09.818 --> 00:28:15.490
It's an interesting phenomenon,
this idea of art and religion

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.269
and why we have these kinds of
things.

00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:24.275
I often think myself--I'm not a
particularly religious person

00:28:24.275 --> 00:28:28.946
but I'm one of these people who
take art and turn it into

00:28:28.946 --> 00:28:32.150
religion in a kind--
odd kind of way.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:36.275
And I think it is possible to
see visions of the divine,

00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:37.700
working with art.
 

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:41.483
And occasionally I do get this,
and in an odd way this--isn't

00:28:41.483 --> 00:28:44.259
this what art is supposed to all
be about?

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:47.400
Why do we have art?
 

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.338
What does it do for us?
 

00:28:49.338 --> 00:28:52.700
It gives us a sense of
something better,

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.470
a vision of something better
than the stupid,

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:59.732
mundane and the vernacular crap
that we have to deal with on a

00:28:59.732 --> 00:29:01.619
quotidian basis out here.
 

00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:04.627
There could be something better;
there's something bigger and

00:29:04.627 --> 00:29:06.019
better out there than we are.
 

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:08.710
That, in essence,
is what art is all about and

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.818
sometimes you can see it and--I
think you can see it,

00:29:11.818 --> 00:29:14.690
or you just seem to be getting
nearer to it.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:17.652
One of the experiences in my
life: Standing at the west end

00:29:17.652 --> 00:29:19.900
of the Cathedral of Chartres on
a bright,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:23.355
sunny day when the back of the
church is still cold and dark

00:29:23.355 --> 00:29:26.634
but all these beautiful blue
lights streaming through the

00:29:26.634 --> 00:29:27.690
stained glass.
 

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.708
In music it often happens,
well, sometimes and maybe with

00:29:31.708 --> 00:29:35.009
Gustav Mahler but particularly
with Mozart,

00:29:35.009 --> 00:29:40.214
and I think it has to do with
the sense of balance and

00:29:40.214 --> 00:29:44.134
proportion,
crystalline clarity that's

00:29:44.134 --> 00:29:45.798
operating there.
 

00:29:45.798 --> 00:29:47.180
So that's what you get with
Mozart,

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:50.160
crystalline clarity,
balance and performance--

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.979
and balance and proportion,
and sometimes with Mozart you

00:29:53.979 --> 00:29:56.230
get &gt;
 

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:01.333
a vision of hell as well when
he switches off into the minor,

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:04.140
so it's a kind of total cosmos.
 

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.498
And I was struck recently when
I came across a passage of

00:30:08.498 --> 00:30:09.900
Johannes Kepler.
 

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:12.160
Now don't get me wrong here.
 

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.324
&gt;
 

00:30:13.324 --> 00:30:16.660
I don't sit around reading the
astrophysicist Johannes Kepler.

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.440
I was reading something else
and this happened to crop up;

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.368
this quote from Kepler came up
in it.

00:30:22.368 --> 00:30:25.111
How many of you in your physics
courses--do they mention Kepler

00:30:25.111 --> 00:30:25.509
at all?
 

00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:26.146
Then--all right.
 

00:30:26.146 --> 00:30:28.460
So you know--you guys know
Kepler a lot better than I do.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.368
Let's not put on airs here.
 

00:30:30.368 --> 00:30:35.176
But this is what Kepler said,
and it seemed like a really

00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:36.980
good passage to me.
 

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:37.535
All right.
 

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:39.980
He's talking about music here
and humanity.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:43.368
"Man, the ape of his
creator,

00:30:43.368 --> 00:30:48.117
has discovered the art of music
so that he might play the

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:53.119
everlastingness of all created
time in some short part of an

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:57.699
hour by means of an artistic
concord of many voices and

00:30:57.699 --> 00:31:02.048
instruments,
that he might to some extent

00:31:02.048 --> 00:31:08.210
taste the satisfaction of God
the workman through music."

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:09.470
Interesting idea.
 

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:12.628
Now in the same vein,
however, what does music--what

00:31:12.628 --> 00:31:13.930
does art do for us?
 

00:31:13.930 --> 00:31:17.682
I was struck there in the
Country Music Hall of Fame on

00:31:17.682 --> 00:31:21.144
Saturday in which the--
you know, you go into these

00:31:21.144 --> 00:31:23.077
things,
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,

00:31:23.077 --> 00:31:24.700
and you push a button and then
the--

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:27.108
one of these artists will come
and talk to you or--

00:31:27.108 --> 00:31:29.601
the recorded thing there,
or sometimes they'll play

00:31:29.601 --> 00:31:30.000
music.
 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.086
Well, they had African American
country singer Charlie Pride

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:36.578
there and he had something to
say.

00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:41.539
I didn't get it down verbatim
but this is the gist of it.

00:31:41.539 --> 00:31:42.970
I went back and wrote it down.
 

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.048
This is what Charlie Pride had
to say.

00:31:45.048 --> 00:31:49.838
"Music is a bridge to my
distant memories.

00:31:49.838 --> 00:31:53.185
When I hear a piece,
it reminds me of a time or an

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:55.849
event of my childhood or of my
youth.

00:31:55.849 --> 00:31:57.670
Music carries me back there.
 

00:31:57.670 --> 00:32:02.638
It is a line that links me in
to the deep reservoir of my

00:32:02.638 --> 00:32:03.970
memory."
 

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:07.140
So that, I think, is also true.
 

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.048
That's another thing that music
does for us.

00:32:09.048 --> 00:32:11.726
It--and I bet you've
experienced this too,

00:32:11.726 --> 00:32:13.618
sort of Proustian in a way.
 

00:32:13.618 --> 00:32:16.907
You hear something that reminds
you when you first heard that

00:32:16.907 --> 00:32:19.813
piece or what you were doing or
perhaps a person or an

00:32:19.813 --> 00:32:20.690
environment.
 

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:23.710
So those are the two advantages
of music.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:24.568
There are others.
 

00:32:24.568 --> 00:32:26.538
You can dance to it,
can relax to it,

00:32:26.538 --> 00:32:29.868
etc., etc., but this idea of
tapping into who you are,

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:33.336
the whole who you are as a
person, through getting you back

00:32:33.336 --> 00:32:35.548
in touch with your inner
memories,

00:32:35.548 --> 00:32:39.121
and also perhaps giving you
hope that there is something out

00:32:39.121 --> 00:32:42.450
there better than what we deal
with on a daily basis.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.730
These are two important aspects
of music,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.224
and it's interesting that one
would come from the

00:32:48.224 --> 00:32:51.188
astrophysicist Kepler and the
other from the country music

00:32:51.188 --> 00:32:54.942
singer Charlie Pride,
but that's one of the wonders

00:32:54.942 --> 00:32:58.088
of the diversity of music,
I suppose.

00:32:58.088 --> 00:32:58.430
Okay.
 

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.903
Well, we don't guarantee you
here any kind of divine

00:33:01.903 --> 00:33:05.308
experience as part of signing up
for Music 112.

00:33:05.308 --> 00:33:08.086
A divine transcendental
experience is not an entitlement

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:08.440
here.
 

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.618
We don't guarantee it.
 

00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:13.230
But you may have yours at some
point in your life,

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:17.432
and I suspect it will come in
some way in association with

00:33:17.432 --> 00:33:19.050
art,
whether the visual arts,

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.700
architecture,
music, whatever.

00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:24.263
And it may come in music--with
the music--of Mozart,

00:33:24.263 --> 00:33:27.410
but how can you sort of load
the dice here?

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.338
How can you get things in your
favor?

00:33:30.338 --> 00:33:33.903
How could you put yourself--you
know, success in life is

00:33:33.903 --> 00:33:36.690
positioning yourself--you say
it's lucky.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.210
Well, you put yourself there to
be lucky.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:43.250
How can you get in the position
to have this experience?

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.450
Well, take a look at the sheet.
 

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:48.660
I was sitting there last night
typing this up.

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.214
It seemed to me that we used to
put these lists on the board but

00:33:51.214 --> 00:33:53.528
then the lists got so long I
decided just to put them on a

00:33:53.528 --> 00:33:54.338
sheet for today.
 

00:33:54.338 --> 00:33:58.442
So here's the list,
"Craig's Essential

00:33:58.442 --> 00:34:00.884
Mozart,"
if you will:

00:34:00.884 --> 00:34:03.981
piano concertos;
Mozart sort of invented the

00:34:03.981 --> 00:34:04.660
piano concerto.
 

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:10.360
We're going to watch a concerto
shortly in music--in section.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.579
I'm going to just recommend
this to you.

00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:14.309
I see we have our performers
here.

00:34:14.309 --> 00:34:15.449
We're going to go on now.
 

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:19.434
We'll end up here a little bit
with some--talking about opera

00:34:19.434 --> 00:34:19.900
here.
 

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.800
You can read through this.
 

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.313
Mozart wrote three great
operas, Marriage of

00:34:23.313 --> 00:34:25.150
Figaro,
Don Giovanni,

00:34:25.150 --> 00:34:29.076
The Magic Flute,
and we're now going to segue

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:31.940
over to a discussion of opera.
 

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:33.940
What's opera?
 

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:35.760
Musically heightened drama.
 

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.500
Music is there behind the drama
and it reinforces it.

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.269
It does the same thing in film.
 

00:34:42.269 --> 00:34:44.018
Ever think about horror films?
 

00:34:44.018 --> 00:34:47.039
What's the scariest horror film
you've ever seen?

00:34:47.039 --> 00:34:48.530
A. J.
 

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:49.809
Student:
"Chucky."

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:53.809
Prof: "Chucky"?
 

00:34:53.809 --> 00:34:54.864
&gt;
 

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:55.085
Okay.
 

00:34:55.085 --> 00:34:57.503
There's one I don't know about,
but "Shining,"

00:34:57.503 --> 00:34:58.559
something like that?
 

00:34:58.559 --> 00:34:58.934
I don't know.
 

00:34:58.934 --> 00:34:59.510
Think of something.
 

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:02.393
I don't get scared when
watching a movie until what

00:35:02.393 --> 00:35:02.969
happens?
 

00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:05.809
I see some really scary visual?
 

00:35:05.809 --> 00:35:07.150
Come on.
 

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.260
What scares you in a movie?
 

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.260
Supposing they took the sound
track out of these horror films.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.280
You wouldn't be frightened at
all.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.954
It's--I think we have a much
more visceral response to sound

00:35:18.954 --> 00:35:22.817
than we do to visual images and
that's what's going on globally

00:35:22.817 --> 00:35:25.184
in opera,
and opera, as you know,

00:35:25.184 --> 00:35:29.086
is made up of an introductory
overture and then these numbers

00:35:29.086 --> 00:35:32.989
such as recitatives where the
composer tells you what's going

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:33.510
on.
 

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.311
You remember the Bugs Bunny--or
I guess it's Warner Brothers

00:35:37.311 --> 00:35:39.309
cartoon: "Be very quiet.
 

00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:41.909
I am hunting wabbit,"
&gt;

00:35:41.909 --> 00:35:43.480
that kind of thing,
&gt;

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.559
so that's a recitative,
what's going on.

00:35:46.559 --> 00:35:51.126
Then somebody will come out and
sing about how they felt about

00:35:51.126 --> 00:35:52.699
what just happened.
 

00:35:52.699 --> 00:35:55.070
That's what's goes on in an
aria.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.576
And arias will tend to repeat
words, and on and on it goes to

00:35:58.576 --> 00:36:01.789
give a sense of emotion,
and there are choruses involved

00:36:01.789 --> 00:36:03.659
in it from time to time too.
 

00:36:03.659 --> 00:36:06.478
As we mentioned,
Mozart wrote three wonderful

00:36:06.478 --> 00:36:10.130
operas, two of them by the
librettist Lorenzo da Ponte.

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:12.284
Read in your textbook,
there's a box on Lorenzo da

00:36:12.284 --> 00:36:14.400
Ponte,
absolutely fascinating life,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.780
far more fascinating than
fiction could ever make it,

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:22.550
but we're going to talk now
about Don Giovanni.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.070
What music is this?
 

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.170
Lynda, could we have the next
piece of music?

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:42.110
&gt;
 

00:36:42.110 --> 00:36:43.599
What's that?
 

00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.469
Nice and loud.
 

00:36:45.469 --> 00:36:46.460
Somebody's got it out there.
 

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:47.050
Student: Overture to
Don Giovanni.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:50.280
Prof: Overture to Don
Giovanni.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.853
You had it as the basis of your
Listening Exercise twenty-five

00:36:52.853 --> 00:36:53.909
on sonata-allegro form.
 

00:36:53.909 --> 00:36:57.130
But it's a different side of
Mozart.

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.469
This is the demonic Mozart.
 

00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:02.929
It's the story of a rake,
a misogynist,

00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:07.077
a woman-hater who tries to
seduce every woman who comes in

00:37:07.077 --> 00:37:11.079
to view simply for the sadistic
pleasure of doing so.

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.920
So that's the basis of this.
 

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.244
It's an interesting time in the
history of intellectual

00:37:18.244 --> 00:37:21.449
processes and political
processes too.

00:37:21.449 --> 00:37:24.782
Here we have a story that
involves male,

00:37:24.782 --> 00:37:27.690
female &lt;&lt;dog
barks&gt;&gt;

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.820
--don't be distracted,
because this one of our cast

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:33.639
members, the dog,
and he's bringing Richard up

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:34.829
along with him.
 

00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:35.530
No--don't go.
 

00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.711
So we have this conflict
between male and female

00:37:39.711 --> 00:37:40.780
interests.
 

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.697
We also have the social being
played out here because we have

00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:48.326
the high-class nobleman,
who goes around disguised and

00:37:48.326 --> 00:37:51.246
seducing women,
as the villain and the noble

00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:54.969
people here are actually the
peasants and servants who are

00:37:54.969 --> 00:37:56.340
doing his bidding.
 

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.336
So that's the kind of tension
that exists here in Don

00:37:59.336 --> 00:38:02.389
Giovanni and note the year
up there on the board,

00:38:02.389 --> 00:38:06.208
17--What--I guess it's on your
sheet for Don Giovanni

00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:10.523
right down there at the bottom,
1788, the year before the

00:38:10.523 --> 00:38:12.130
French Revolution.
 

00:38:12.130 --> 00:38:16.289
Okay.
 

00:38:16.289 --> 00:38:18.621
We have a guest with us today
and we're going to introduce

00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:19.889
him, Professor Richard Lalli.
 

00:38:19.889 --> 00:38:21.909
How many of you know who
Richard Lalli is?

00:38:21.909 --> 00:38:22.318
Okay.
 

00:38:22.318 --> 00:38:24.940
Oh, good, a famous guy already.
 

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.010
Richard is a professor of music
here at Yale.

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:33.717
And what really annoys me is
that a year or so ago he won the

00:38:33.717 --> 00:38:38.380
single most important prize at
Yale University.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.179
And what is it?
 

00:38:39.179 --> 00:38:41.960
The prize for the best teacher
at Yale.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.682
How many undergraduate
instructors do we have here at

00:38:44.682 --> 00:38:45.050
Yale?
 

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:46.268
Four, five, six hundred?
 

00:38:46.268 --> 00:38:51.083
Numero uno over there,
but more--equally interesting,

00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:52.750
he is also what?
 

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:54.789
Hm?
 

00:38:54.789 --> 00:38:59.130
An incoming master of Jonathan
Edwards College starting next

00:38:59.130 --> 00:38:59.940
semester?
 

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.099
Starting in January.
 

00:39:01.099 --> 00:39:04.289
And he happens to be a darn
good singer, as you will see

00:39:04.289 --> 00:39:05.739
here in just a minute.
 

00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:08.860
So we're going to start out
here with a little of this,

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.268
and Richard and his friend are
going to help us out here.

00:39:12.268 --> 00:39:13.369
Hi, there.
 

00:39:13.369 --> 00:39:16.119
&gt;
 

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:18.070
And did--okay.
 

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:23.547
So--What we've got here is an
aria first for Leporello,

00:39:23.547 --> 00:39:27.300
who is the servant of Don
Giovanni.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.768
He's a kind of low on the
academic totem pole.

00:39:31.768 --> 00:39:34.110
He's kind of like a TA in life
here.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.920
So we've called on
&gt;

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.860
Jacob.
 

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.697
So this is Leporello,
and as you will notice,

00:39:44.697 --> 00:39:47.469
Mozart crafts the music to fit
Leporello.

00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:49.269
It's not highfalutin music.
 

00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:50.869
It has a rather narrow range.
 

00:39:50.869 --> 00:39:54.228
It doesn't go way--it has a lot
of patter recitative in it,

00:39:54.228 --> 00:39:57.413
and at the very beginning
Mozart kind of blocks out this

00:39:57.413 --> 00:39:58.340
pacing idea.
 

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:01.309
Leporello is down underneath a
balcony.

00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:06.300
Don Giovanni is up above trying
to seduce Donna Anna and he is

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.126
impatient and he hates this
position in life in which he has

00:40:11.126 --> 00:40:12.190
been put.
 

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:27.820
&gt;
 

00:40:27.820 --> 00:41:37.420
&gt;
 

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:39.030
Bravo.
 

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:45.119
&gt;
 

00:41:45.119 --> 00:41:48.360
And thanks to Santana also who
learned this part in one day,

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:49.019
basically.
 

00:41:49.019 --> 00:41:51.219
Right? Yeah. All right.
 

00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:52.969
So things have not gone well
this time.

00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:55.719
Unexpectedly,
Donna Anna has been able to

00:41:55.719 --> 00:41:59.500
rebuff Don Giovanni and she now
wants to unmask him--

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:02.166
and she would then find out
that he's really the leading

00:42:02.166 --> 00:42:04.420
nobleman of the town--
wants to unmask him.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.099
She chases him--after him,
out of the--he runs away.

00:42:07.099 --> 00:42:08.380
She's screaming.
 

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:13.735
She calls for her father who is
the aging Commendatore and the

00:42:13.735 --> 00:42:16.018
Commendatore--excuse me.
 

00:42:16.018 --> 00:42:22.159
The Commendatore confronts Don
Giovanni, tries to challenge him

00:42:22.159 --> 00:42:26.420
to a duel and they engage in
such a duel.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:32.492
So let's--we'll have Don
Giovanni come up and let me grab

00:42:32.492 --> 00:42:35.420
the Commendatore's music.
 

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:39.030
Great. Here we go. Thanks.
 

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:50.460
So I have--Here comes the
Commendatore.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.750
Here comes the minor music and
we're going to have a

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.460
confrontation between the
Commendatore,

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.300
the old commander,
and the youthful,

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.179
spry, vocally skillful Don
Giovanni.

00:43:03.179 --> 00:43:05.969
&gt;
 

00:43:05.969 --> 00:43:13.130
&gt;
 

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.480
&gt;
 

00:43:18.480 --> 00:44:23.769
&gt;
 

00:44:23.769 --> 00:44:29.139
&gt;
 

00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:35.219
&gt;
 

00:44:35.219 --> 00:44:40.260
&gt;
 

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.460
I would have Don Giovanni
something like this and have

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.679
&gt;.
 

00:44:46.679 --> 00:44:46.952
Okay.
 

00:44:46.952 --> 00:44:47.496
Excuse me.
 

00:44:47.496 --> 00:44:50.000
The Commendatore was just
stabbed like this.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.989
Don Giovanni is over top of him.
 

00:44:51.989 --> 00:44:54.960
Mozart wrote this exquisite
little trio here.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.219
It goes by very quickly.
 

00:44:56.219 --> 00:44:59.054
Nobody ever notices it but it's
some of the most beautiful music

00:44:59.054 --> 00:45:00.000
that he ever wrote.
 

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.619
We ended up on a diminished
chord and then the penetrative

00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:07.367
diminished chord again at the
top of that line where he gets

00:45:07.367 --> 00:45:08.130
stabbed.
 

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:12.809
Okay, and then we have this
little trio.

00:45:12.809 --> 00:45:18.119
Leporello--He's just cowering.
 

00:45:18.119 --> 00:45:20.018
He just wants to get out of
here.

00:45:20.018 --> 00:45:21.530
This is the worst thing he's
ever seen.

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.570
Don Giovanni is a bit surprised
but says, "You had it

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.186
coming to you,"
and the Commendatore is about

00:45:27.186 --> 00:45:28.519
to buy the farm here.
 

00:45:28.519 --> 00:45:29.780
He's on his way out.
 

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:31.896
So it's just this little
about--I don't know--ten,

00:45:31.896 --> 00:45:34.271
twelve measures or so of
exquisitely beautiful music and

00:45:34.271 --> 00:45:36.000
we'll do it nice and slowly for
you.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.320
&gt;
 

00:45:40.320 --> 00:47:00.030
&gt;
 

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:01.760
Well, that's that scene.
 

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:07.849
&gt;
 

00:47:07.849 --> 00:47:12.030
&gt;
 

00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:17.992
Don Giovanni goes on to another
seduction in which he attempts

00:47:17.992 --> 00:47:24.250
to engage in amorous compromise
with &gt;

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:29.150
he makes his advance and she is
initially intrigued.

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.869
Will she succumb to his
advances?

00:47:31.869 --> 00:47:33.090
Let's find out.
 

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:38.449
 
 

00:47:38.449 --> 00:47:41.219
&gt;
 

00:47:41.219 --> 00:51:20.920
&gt;
 

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.650
&gt;
 

00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:23.690
&gt;
 

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:32.920
&gt;
 

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.300
That's it for today.
 

00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.460
Next week we're doing
Goetterdaemmerung! 

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:43.000

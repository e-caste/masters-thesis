00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.154
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, I want to do two

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:06.661
things today;
but, I know what I'm going to

00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:09.747
do, I'm going to end up talking
about what I want to,

00:00:09.747 --> 00:00:13.190
and that's schools and the role
of schools in identity.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.126
But first of all I want to talk
a little bit about the question

00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:19.920
of when, and it's a big
historical debate,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.146
when people in France began
thinking of themselves as

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:29.104
French, and then I'm going to
specifically look at the role of

00:00:29.104 --> 00:00:32.265
schools in that.
And I guess I'd better talk a

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.124
little bit about schools today
too, because identity is

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:38.195
something in an age of mass
tourism that's a little hard to

00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:41.381
hold onto.
So, I think I'm going to talk

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:44.020
about that as well,
at the end.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.550
I know I am because I love
talking about it.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.834
And so I will be repeating just
a couple of things that I said

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.150
the first day,
but many of you were shopping

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.548
other things the first day.
So, sort of the

00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:57.510
problématique,
or the question to be resolved,

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.853
is when did people in France,
the majority of the population

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:06.068
or all the population,
begin thinking of themselves as

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:09.069
French, as opposed to something
else?

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:14.103
And as I said the first time,
that in 1789 about half the

00:01:14.103 --> 00:01:17.340
population of France spoke
French.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.939
In 1871 about a quarter of the
population spoke French.

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.746
And so it's a leap of faith to
think that the language you

00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:36.314
speak totally informs your
identity or who you think you

00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:39.627
are.
I gave the case of Alsatians

00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:43.333
who spoke German who,
many of whom considered

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:47.965
themselves French after Alsace
and much of Lorraine were

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:53.026
annexed to Germany in 1871.
Now, there was a book published

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:56.767
in--a long time ago,
ooh-la-la--by a friend

00:01:56.767 --> 00:02:00.049
of mine who unfortunately
recently died,

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.556
sort of an homme de
lettres, a wonderful writer

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:04.778
called Eugen Weber,
that put forward a view that

00:02:04.778 --> 00:02:07.757
some people find convincing and
which I don't find convincing at

00:02:07.757 --> 00:02:10.805
all.
But it became sort of the canon

00:02:10.805 --> 00:02:14.459
or the accepted,
assumed truth about national

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.610
identity and France--was that in
his view until about 1880,

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.177
until the Republic became
rooted, that you had in

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:27.116
provincial France and
particularly in rural France and

00:02:27.116 --> 00:02:30.090
particularly in the south of
France,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.171
you had almost a total
unawareness of what it was

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:39.702
like--of French identity.
Somebody in about 1864,

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:42.973
if I remember right,
went into a school in the

00:02:42.973 --> 00:02:45.609
Lozère,
which is France's least

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.319
populated department (only about
77,000 people now live in the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.300
Lozère) and asked them
what France was,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.889
and the students in the school
had absolutely no idea.

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.264
And this particular book
marshaled all sorts of evidence

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:04.981
about sort of savage beliefs,
as he put it,

00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:09.600
that people believed it was
just a superstitious,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.219
isolated, rural France in which
civilization,

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.243
entre guillemets (in
quotes), could only come

00:03:18.243 --> 00:03:21.400
through, along with national
identity,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.919
through these sort of agencies
of change.

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.161
And this is what sociologists
used to call Modernization

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:31.068
Theory, almost at its worst;
and I say this with

00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:34.243
considerable affection for my
late friend Eugen Weber,

00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:37.815
and we had debated this before.
And the three big agencies of

00:03:37.815 --> 00:03:40.673
change, some of which you've
already heard a little bit

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:42.414
about,
according to Weber,

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:46.210
that transformed peasants into
Frenchmen were railroads;

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.929
that is, again the trunk lines
reaching out from Paris,

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.960
all railroads leading
eventually to Paris;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.833
secondly, military
conscription,

00:03:56.833 --> 00:04:03.330
teaching people Breton or
people from Gascony or even

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.616
limousins,
people from the center of

00:04:06.616 --> 00:04:08.828
France, good French,
or males anyway,

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:10.980
by forcing them to speak
French;

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.879
and third, schools;
that is, the increase in

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.730
literacy in France,
dramatic.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.708
In the course of the nineteenth
century there was always a big

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:25.839
gap between male literacy and
female literacy,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:30.699
and this gap is closed,
such as by 1900 the vast

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.870
majority of people in France can
read and write.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.868
How do we know that, by the way?
Well one of the ways that

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:41.835
historians have tried to assess
those things in the past is

00:04:41.835 --> 00:04:44.240
looking at military conscription
records or,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.541
for example,
looking at the people who are

00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:48.730
witnesses to life's great
ceremonies,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.266
births, marriages,
deaths, whether they can sign

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:56.180
their name or whether they just
simply write an X,

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.326
that they can't sign.
And of course there are other

00:05:00.326 --> 00:05:02.957
ways of knowing this too,
studying school records and

00:05:02.957 --> 00:05:05.931
this sort of thing.
So, this is the basic kind of

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:09.717
interpretation that became for
many people quite compelling,

00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:13.151
as I said the other day.
So, by 1914 you have these

00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.750
Bretons, and Breton is a
language that has nothing to do

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.393
with French at all,
being able to go off to die in

00:05:20.393 --> 00:05:24.139
1914 or subsequent years singing
the Marseillaise.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.329
Now, the role of language in
the military is an interesting

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:28.475
subject.
If you take the

00:05:28.475 --> 00:05:30.180
Austro-Hungarian Empire,
which had at least,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.065
depending on how you count it,
twelve major national groups or

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:37.720
nationalities,
to get anywhere in the Army,

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.899
and the Army was this kind of
social promotion,

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:42.079
to become an officer you had to
know German;

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.404
in order to become a bureaucrat
or to become a teacher,

00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:48.113
in most parts of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:51.365
you needed to know German.
And so the argument has been

00:05:51.365 --> 00:05:52.519
about France,
as well.

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:56.414
The traditional view is that
these--the schoolteachers

00:05:56.414 --> 00:06:01.042
gradually, while they're sort of
forcing the Virgin Mary off the

00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:05.704
walls of public schools,
replacing her with Marianne,

00:06:05.704 --> 00:06:10.353
the female image of the
Republic, are also bringing

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:16.213
French to all of the little kids
and therefore civilizing France

00:06:16.213 --> 00:06:21.699
and turning French peasants into
French men and women;

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.060
or so that is a conventional
view.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.946
Well, I don't agree with that
view, and what I want to do is

00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:32.030
nuance it and then,
drawing on some of the research

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.223
of my friend
Jean-François Chanet,

00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:37.459
talk a little bit about the
role of schools in the last half

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.384
of the nineteen century,
and then talk a little bit

00:06:40.384 --> 00:06:43.310
about the role of schools now,
because as I said I find it

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.555
interesting.
Now, the whole question of

00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:52.839
timing is essential in trying to
understand when we can at least,

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:56.527
and this may be sort of a leap
of faith, assume that French

00:06:56.527 --> 00:06:59.133
national identity had permeated
all of the

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.740
départements in
France;

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.440
and Corsica is a case apart,
that's even more complicated.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.856
So, the question is timing.
But again, simply to repeat

00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:11.336
what I said the very first day,
if you look around the map of

00:07:11.336 --> 00:07:13.677
France,
what did people speak in 1871,

00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:17.210
what did they speak in 1789?
They don't always speak those

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:19.610
same things now.
In most cases they don't.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.620
So, that suggests that timing
is crucial in all this.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.769
But just again,
I did this the other day but,

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.332
what the hell,
let's do it again,

00:07:26.332 --> 00:07:28.529
up here, in Flanders,
many spoke Flemish;

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.735
if you're moving into Lorraine,
amputated Lorraine and Alsace,

00:07:32.735 --> 00:07:35.009
most people,
the vast majority,

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.216
and we'll be more specific
about this when we talk about

00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:39.742
the origins of World War I,
spoke a German dialect that's

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.670
very similar to that spoken in
Fribourg.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:46.985
Savoie was annexed in 1860,
they spoke a Savoyard language

00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:52.487
or dialect that's very much like
Piedmontese, in the case of

00:07:52.487 --> 00:07:54.740
Italy.
Language is fascinating.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.713
At the time of the unification
of Italy in the 1860s and '70s,

00:07:58.713 --> 00:08:02.166
remembering that Metternich
once said that Italy was a

00:08:02.166 --> 00:08:05.444
geographic expression,
the percentage of the Italian

00:08:05.444 --> 00:08:08.668
population that spoke now what
we consider to be Italian was

00:08:08.668 --> 00:08:11.417
about five percent;
that is, the people spoke

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:14.079
Tuscan or what they speak around
Florence.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.879
So, if you move down here,
and they spoke

00:08:16.879 --> 00:08:19.680
Provençal,
which is a real written

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.019
language and had a revival with
various poets in a place called

00:08:24.019 --> 00:08:26.849
Les Baux here,
which has turned into kind of

00:08:26.849 --> 00:08:29.509
the equivalent of EuroDisney,
sort of a tourist trap,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.129
like so many places in the
south;

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:34.684
moving to Languedoc,
they spoke a language of Oc,

00:08:34.684 --> 00:08:38.832
they spoke Languedocien and
with all its patois variants,

00:08:38.832 --> 00:08:42.357
spoken language variants.
In Auvergne they spoke an

00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:45.200
Auvergnat patois.
Down here they spoke Catalan.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.700
Here they spoke a patois,
influenced by Spanish.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.496
Here they spoke Basque which
doesn't have anything to do with

00:08:51.496 --> 00:08:54.340
anything, outside of a little
bit of Hungarian and Finnish.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.735
Up here they spoke Gascon,
and I gave cases before of

00:08:57.735 --> 00:09:00.935
people speaking patois,
even in Normandy and even,

00:09:00.935 --> 00:09:04.070
for that matter,
in the Valley of the Loire.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:08.148
And here they spoke Breton.
There's a wonderful book,

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:10.583
if you want,
now here's a good paper topic,

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:13.133
take a book called The Horse
of Pride,

00:09:13.133 --> 00:09:16.960
written by a man called Helias.
He wrote it in Breton.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.125
It was translated into French
and then into English,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:23.166
and it's about growing up in
the 1920s and '30s in

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:25.565
Finistère,
which is the most-- the

00:09:25.565 --> 00:09:28.470
furthest, most Breton of all the
départements,

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.830
and it's about what happens
when the outsiders,

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.460
that is the French,
begin to come.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.461
And they start calling the
French Kodakers because they

00:09:37.461 --> 00:09:40.017
come with Kodak cameras,
and so they become the

00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:42.257
Kodakers.
And so the church says you got

00:09:42.257 --> 00:09:45.341
to--we have to stop all these
crazy superstitions--in Brittany

00:09:45.341 --> 00:09:48.022
people rubbing statues to cure
themselves from various

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:50.765
ailments.
The most ludicrous was probably

00:09:50.765 --> 00:09:54.309
a saint, an imaginary saint
called Saint Sans Pissou.

00:09:54.309 --> 00:09:57.682
So, if you rubbed or said
prayers to Sans Pissou--you

00:09:57.682 --> 00:10:01.509
probably already got it--you
cured yourself of urinary tract

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:06.265
infections, sans pissou.
So, they send in these priests

00:10:06.265 --> 00:10:10.490
who are supposed to preach in
French, in Brittany.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.127
This is the 1920s.
So, again the question of

00:10:13.127 --> 00:10:15.624
timing is crucial.
And at one point he tells this

00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:18.180
hilarious story where the
priest, and I guess I can

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.511
remember this,
when I was little tiny boy,

00:10:20.511 --> 00:10:23.596
the priest would turn around
and say, at some point in the

00:10:23.596 --> 00:10:25.950
Mass,
"Kyrie eleison."

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.110
I guess that means,
"Christ has mercy.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.199
And he would turn around and
all these Bretons,

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.789
particularly all the Breton
kids,

00:10:31.789 --> 00:10:34.429
he'd turn around and say
"Kyrie eleison," and he

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:36.874
was greeted with gales of
laughter because Kyrie

00:10:36.874 --> 00:10:39.394
eleison means,
in Breton, purely by

00:10:39.394 --> 00:10:42.139
coincidence, "there are many
wagons."

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:44.230
And then they would all laugh
at him.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.121
And so there was a failure to
understand each other,

00:10:47.121 --> 00:10:50.239
and the idea that somehow these
Bretons were all kind of

00:10:50.239 --> 00:10:52.439
plooks,
were bumpkins,

00:10:52.439 --> 00:10:57.157
were uneducated people who
could never become part of the

00:10:57.157 --> 00:11:01.960
true France because they didn't
know French very well.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.604
And of course what the Breton
do is they move to Paris,

00:11:04.604 --> 00:11:06.905
in large numbers,
and the first thing you see in

00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:09.059
the Gare Montparnasse is the
Assistance,

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:11.069
still today,
it's the Social--the Office of

00:11:11.069 --> 00:11:13.797
Social Assistance for Breton,
and they all live around the

00:11:13.797 --> 00:11:15.739
Gare Montparnasse,
which is why so many

00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:18.364
cafés around the Gare
Montparnasse in Paris are named

00:11:18.364 --> 00:11:20.500
after Breton towns--La Ville de
Saint-Brieuc,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.830
La Ville de Nantes,
Dinan, and all this kind of

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:26.120
stuff.
Okay, so what about timing in

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.580
all this?
So, was Weber completely wrong?

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.860
No, it depends on what you're
talking about.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.324
If you wanted to talk about
when people in the Loire begin

00:11:35.324 --> 00:11:39.216
thinking themselves as French,
the answer is really in the

00:11:39.216 --> 00:11:42.820
seventeenth century or in the
eighteenth century.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.795
And certainly the French
Revolution, which precipitates

00:11:45.795 --> 00:11:47.889
this enormous civil war in the
west,

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:51.829
was basically a war between
Jacobins, that is,

00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:56.731
Paris centralizing French,
and people speaking patois who

00:11:56.731 --> 00:12:00.062
resisted,
in the name of religion and in

00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:04.008
the name of their nobles,
who resisted the influence of

00:12:04.008 --> 00:12:06.652
the French State.
And if you're going to

00:12:06.652 --> 00:12:09.822
take--Alsace and Lorraine were
conquered by--Louis XIV would

00:12:09.822 --> 00:12:13.368
have conquered Wyoming,
if he could have--and they

00:12:13.368 --> 00:12:16.840
become French in the seventeenth
century.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.740
So, there was a shared identity
there.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.169
You can have more than one
identity.

00:12:21.169 --> 00:12:24.292
You have more than one identity
in your lives yourselves,

00:12:24.292 --> 00:12:27.582
so it's kind of silly to look
for this one national identity

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:30.776
that emerges.
If you wanted to--one of the

00:12:30.776 --> 00:12:35.509
historical facts that's bad news
for this kind of general,

00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:39.008
oversimplified interpretation
is a series of events,

00:12:39.008 --> 00:12:41.889
that doesn't concern you in
this course,

00:12:41.889 --> 00:12:44.750
and that is the Revolution of
1848.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.680
There's a big revolution in
1848, and what begins as an

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.183
urban revolution in Paris,
and in Rouen,

00:12:50.183 --> 00:12:53.207
and in Limoges,
and Lyon and all sorts of

00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:57.593
places, becomes basically a
rural movement of people on the

00:12:57.593 --> 00:12:59.806
Left,
in much of the center,

00:12:59.806 --> 00:13:02.720
but much, even more of the
south of France;

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.669
and it ends in 1851,
when Louis Napoleon,

00:13:06.669 --> 00:13:12.200
the prince--the guy who would
become Prince President,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.553
who would become Napoleon III,
when he has a coup

00:13:15.553 --> 00:13:18.137
d'état,
the 2^(nd) of December,

00:13:18.137 --> 00:13:21.909
1851, and people in Paris wake
up with pill boxes.

00:13:21.909 --> 00:13:24.470
But what happens next--and
don't write this down,

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.563
but it's good to know--is that
it gives rise to the largest

00:13:27.563 --> 00:13:30.870
national insurrection in France
in the nineteenth century,

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.404
to defend the Republic.
And most--the Secret Societies

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:37.139
that were formed have a lot to
do with this.

00:13:37.139 --> 00:13:40.348
I once read the interrogation
of a great-great-great-great

00:13:40.348 --> 00:13:43.613
uncle of our neighbor who was
arrested for trying to defend

00:13:43.613 --> 00:13:46.462
the Republic,
and his interrogation had to be

00:13:46.462 --> 00:13:48.659
translated from patois into
French.

00:13:48.659 --> 00:13:51.625
And so in departments,
I won't go through them all,

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.590
but from the Pyrén&amp;eac
ute;es-Orientales,

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.425
to the Aude,
to the Gers,

00:13:56.425 --> 00:13:59.406
the Hérault,
the Gers--Bas-Alpes,

00:13:59.406 --> 00:14:03.230
for now it's called the
Alpes--Haute-Provence,

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.819
the Drôme,
the Ardèche and all

00:14:05.819 --> 00:14:08.133
these places,
they rise up to try to defend

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:10.947
the Republic,
and the vast majority of those

00:14:10.947 --> 00:14:14.703
people that did were peasants,
and many of them did not speak

00:14:14.703 --> 00:14:17.238
French.
Now, political action is a form

00:14:17.238 --> 00:14:20.009
of establishing one's own
national identity.

00:14:20.009 --> 00:14:22.370
They were fighting for a French
republic.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:26.114
One of the ironies is that
people, for example,

00:14:26.114 --> 00:14:29.370
in Catalonia were fighting in
Catalan,

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.542
in the Catalan language,
for a Jacobin view of the Left,

00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:36.728
held by the Left,
that would view their own

00:14:36.728 --> 00:14:40.672
language as something
antithetical to progress of the

00:14:40.672 --> 00:14:45.300
civilization that people thought
was represented by the French

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:48.203
language.
So, the question of timing

00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:50.994
here, you could argue that for
this area here,

00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:54.512
which was extremely backward,
though I hate that word--the

00:14:54.512 --> 00:14:57.742
Limousin, these departments
here--you don't have to know the

00:14:57.742 --> 00:15:00.820
departments--but the Creuse,
the Corrèze and the

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.943
Haute-Vienne,
where I used to live in the

00:15:02.943 --> 00:15:06.182
Haute-Vienne--I don't have much
affection for it actually--but

00:15:06.182 --> 00:15:09.370
that these areas,
the timing is much earlier than

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.500
1880s, and they didn't have to
wait for trains,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.571
military conscription or even
to be able to know the French

00:15:16.571 --> 00:15:19.309
language vis-à-vis the
school.

00:15:19.309 --> 00:15:22.703
And so there's some more things
that could be said,

00:15:22.703 --> 00:15:26.910
also in terms of explaining how
complicated this whole question

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.415
of identity is.
And we have a tendency,

00:15:29.415 --> 00:15:31.686
people who believe in
modernization and that

00:15:31.686 --> 00:15:34.169
everything has to pass though
modernization,

00:15:34.169 --> 00:15:36.927
believe that history runs on
railroad tracks,

00:15:36.927 --> 00:15:40.437
and all you have to know is
when the train arrives in the

00:15:40.437 --> 00:15:42.699
station,
and that you forget people

00:15:42.699 --> 00:15:45.127
along the way.
A friend of mine once said,

00:15:45.127 --> 00:15:48.299
"it's bitter hard to write the
history of remainders."

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:50.899
That's something that's always
haunted me, that phrase;

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.908
people who weren't modern and
therefore aren't interesting and

00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:58.022
shouldn't be studied.
But in fact the roads,

00:15:58.022 --> 00:16:01.447
the increase in roads in the
eighteenth century,

00:16:01.447 --> 00:16:05.527
the improvements in roads in
the eighteenth and the first

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:10.293
half of the nineteenth century,
were more important than

00:16:10.293 --> 00:16:15.652
railroads were in achieving in
many parts of France this kind

00:16:15.652 --> 00:16:18.291
of integration.
And furthermore,

00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:22.160
if you look at the expansion of
the French economy--and again

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.320
the only--what we're thinking
about is timing,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.878
don't worry about these
details, just having you think

00:16:28.878 --> 00:16:32.840
about national identity--the
French economy expanded rapidly

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:36.918
in the 1820s and '30s and '40s,
and again in the 1850s and

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:40.442
'60s, when railroads had
something to do with the '50s

00:16:40.442 --> 00:16:43.347
and '60s.
But it expands with the

00:16:43.347 --> 00:16:49.120
improvement of roads that bring
people into towns that make them

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:54.710
aware of La France and
make them aware of politics.

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.875
And what these,
all these departments,

00:16:56.875 --> 00:16:59.860
there were eighteen of them
that rose up in 1851,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.533
that rural people before--as
they dropped their--and run

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:06.387
across the fields,
dump their pitchforks and their

00:17:06.387 --> 00:17:08.099
hunting rifles as the troops
come.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:13.659
But all, every one of these
people, what they really had in

00:17:13.659 --> 00:17:19.123
common was that they were in
areas in which the market had

00:17:19.123 --> 00:17:24.970
expanded in the 1820s and the
1830s through better roads.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.599
So again, railroads were
important.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.922
The first railroad ride that
many people took in France were

00:17:30.922 --> 00:17:33.343
pilgrimage sites,
to Lourdes and things like

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:35.539
that, more about that another
time.

00:17:35.539 --> 00:17:38.361
But that's not all that's
important, and if you just look

00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:40.729
for what is "modern,"
that is like TGV,

00:17:40.729 --> 00:17:44.287
or the godawful trains going to
New York from here,

00:17:44.287 --> 00:17:46.920
then you miss a lot of the
action.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.124
So, the timing is important.
But what about 1914,

00:17:50.124 --> 00:17:54.428
did these Bretons who are
conscripted, did they really

00:17:54.428 --> 00:17:58.126
know much about France,
that they're going off to fight

00:17:58.126 --> 00:18:00.875
for and to die for?
Well, that's a leap of faith as

00:18:00.875 --> 00:18:03.508
well.
Certainly it's true that the

00:18:03.508 --> 00:18:07.860
French language spreads among
Bretons, through the war

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.718
experience,
those people lucky enough to

00:18:10.718 --> 00:18:13.341
have survived,
that weren't in the 1,500,000

00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:15.966
dead.
But that's coming during the

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:20.240
war, it's not necessarily coming
before the war at all.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.915
Furthermore,
just because one didn't speak

00:18:24.915 --> 00:18:31.529
French, did that condemn people
to eternal backwardness?

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:36.943
I've studied strikes in Limoges
in 1905 and before that in which

00:18:36.943 --> 00:18:41.240
the workers were striking
against big companies,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.241
against Haviland,
the porcelain--oh,

00:18:43.241 --> 00:18:46.213
that's another story--the
Haviland American Porcelain

00:18:46.213 --> 00:18:48.237
Company,
they were chanting,

00:18:48.237 --> 00:18:51.896
"long live the Social
Republic," not in French but in

00:18:51.896 --> 00:18:53.720
patois,
but in patois,

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.920
in a Limosin patois,
and not in French.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:58.849
Does this mean they
don't--they're not French?

00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:01.947
No, it doesn't mean that at
all, but it just means that part

00:19:01.947 --> 00:19:05.359
of their identity is being from
that particular part of France,

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:07.349
and you can have multiple
identities.

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:10.920
And so the sort of simplistic
view of when these people start

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.550
seeing themselves as French is
extraordinarily complicated.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:17.236
What about Corsica?
You've still got about seven or

00:19:17.236 --> 00:19:19.798
eight percent of the population,
that's just a guess,

00:19:19.798 --> 00:19:21.670
who don't want to be French at
all.

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.228
You still have people blowing
up occasionally these high rise

00:19:25.228 --> 00:19:29.507
apartments, condominiums,
in Corsica because they don't

00:19:29.507 --> 00:19:34.956
want tourists there in August,
and to an extent--I'm not for

00:19:34.956 --> 00:19:38.020
blowing up anything,
but who can blame them not

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.250
wanting tourists there in
August;

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:44.170
we're just blighted by tourists
in the south.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.380
So, it just is terribly
complicated.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:49.819
And of course the case of
Brittany is classic.

00:19:49.819 --> 00:19:54.880
Gradually the French Language
moves in this direction,

00:19:54.880 --> 00:20:00.704
but still in the 1920s and '30s
the overwhelming percentage of

00:20:00.704 --> 00:20:05.670
the population still speak
Breton in daily life.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:09.957
What about--just an aside,
one of thousands of asides--but

00:20:09.957 --> 00:20:12.740
what about time since World War
II?

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:17.883
Before I get to schools,
what do people speak--when does

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.476
patois disappear?
Well, I've always been

00:20:20.476 --> 00:20:22.738
interested in that because we
live in a village of about three

00:20:22.738 --> 00:20:27.150
hundred and thirty-nine people.
It's a very old population.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.561
The church bell rings slowly,
very, very often,

00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:33.528
and another of us has been
snatched away,

00:20:33.528 --> 00:20:35.082
sadly.
In the south,

00:20:35.082 --> 00:20:37.896
in this part of France,
in the Ardèche,

00:20:37.896 --> 00:20:41.755
in what you call the Vivarais,
the Bas-Vivarais,

00:20:41.755 --> 00:20:46.615
it doesn't matter,
people spoke patois in daily

00:20:46.615 --> 00:20:52.838
life in the 1920s and 1930s,
and then people who were old

00:20:52.838 --> 00:20:57.471
would speak it among themselves
in the 1940s,

00:20:57.471 --> 00:21:00.112
the 1950s.
The people that I know that are

00:21:00.112 --> 00:21:02.329
old, including my boule
partner--boule,

00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:03.684
we play boule,
and we drink a little

00:21:03.684 --> 00:21:05.200
Chardonnay--oh,
I'm not supposed to say that,

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.519
but we drink a little
Chardonnay on the side,

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:08.200
or pastis, quelque
pastis de temps de temps;

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.644
pas de temps de temps,
tous les temps!--the people

00:21:11.644 --> 00:21:14.180
that are playing--my friend
who's 80,

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:19.859
he can understand patois but he
can't read it and he can't write

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:22.293
it.
When I asked him to correct

00:21:22.293 --> 00:21:26.849
some sentences that I'd copied
in patois, in a book that I did,

00:21:26.849 --> 00:21:30.450
for the French translation,
he couldn't do it.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.369
So that's disappeared.
But say in Auvergne,

00:21:33.369 --> 00:21:37.997
Auvergne are these departments
here, I won't go through them

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:41.078
all but Aviron,
Cantal, Haute-Loire,

00:21:41.078 --> 00:21:44.666
et cetera,
Puy-du-Dôme up here,

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:49.839
maybe Dallier a little bit--in
the 1960s and early 1970s patois

00:21:49.839 --> 00:21:53.259
was still spoken in many
households.

00:21:53.259 --> 00:21:56.694
And when the classic,
kind of eternal triangle,

00:21:56.694 --> 00:22:00.799
that is, the parents,
the school kid and the teacher,

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:03.698
was often then had something to
do with language,

00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:06.838
because the parents felt
themselves at a disadvantage

00:22:06.838 --> 00:22:10.220
because their French wasn't as
good as their patois;

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.359
and this isn't the 1860s,
this is the 1960s.

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:17.492
And in Corsica there's still
people who speak Corsican

00:22:17.492 --> 00:22:22.170
language but basically almost
everybody now speaks French.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.196
And even in the movie I
mentioned this the other day by

00:22:25.196 --> 00:22:28.281
Jean, Jean de Florette,
and all of that,

00:22:28.281 --> 00:22:31.996
there they had to equip one of
the main actors,

00:22:31.996 --> 00:22:34.840
Daniel Auteuil,
they had to train him,

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.253
even though he's from Avignon,
how to speak with a real

00:22:38.253 --> 00:22:42.864
Provençal accent.
But that's false because in the

00:22:42.864 --> 00:22:48.673
1920s, when he comes back from
World War I, they're going to be

00:22:48.673 --> 00:22:52.511
speaking Provençal,
they're not going to be

00:22:52.511 --> 00:22:54.682
speaking French.
Now, what about--well,

00:22:54.682 --> 00:22:57.673
I don't even have time to get
into this, but about

00:22:57.673 --> 00:23:00.755
universities?
One of the things that's been

00:23:00.755 --> 00:23:04.749
good in the last 20 years in
France is that before--as I

00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:06.745
said,
de Gaulle wanted to crush

00:23:06.745 --> 00:23:10.030
regional languages and cultures
like grapes--but one of the

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.542
things that's happened is that
now universities are very active

00:23:13.542 --> 00:23:16.713
in teaching these languages that
are part of the regional

00:23:16.713 --> 00:23:19.397
identity;
that is, not necessarily

00:23:19.397 --> 00:23:23.099
antithetical at all to the sense
of being French.

00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:26.680
The University of Nantes,
which is horribly rightwing;

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.010
but, Rennes,
Rennes in particular teaches a

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.420
Breton, and there's been a
revival there;

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.032
or Perpignan,
very, very strong in Catalan

00:23:36.032 --> 00:23:37.382
studies;
and in Toulouse,

00:23:37.382 --> 00:23:39.295
which--there's a very good
university there,

00:23:39.295 --> 00:23:42.009
though the city is wonderful
but the university is a dump;

00:23:42.009 --> 00:23:44.317
and also when we had the big
explosion there,

00:23:44.317 --> 00:23:47.201
we were there when that all
happened in the Fall of 2001

00:23:47.201 --> 00:23:50.295
where--there were some even more
horrible explosions in this

00:23:50.295 --> 00:23:53.163
country,
as you well know--the whole

00:23:53.163 --> 00:23:57.587
campus was sort of moved by this
huge explosion when this

00:23:57.587 --> 00:24:01.933
chemical factory blew up.
But there, there's been a

00:24:01.933 --> 00:24:06.711
revival in the teaching of
Occitan, the sort of Languedoc

00:24:06.711 --> 00:24:10.210
languages that were soon to
disappear,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.021
et cetera, et cetera.
Now, so, be a little cautious

00:24:14.021 --> 00:24:19.210
in assuming that well everybody
in 1914 felt themselves French,

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:24.004
or thinking that these sort of
agencies of modernization are

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:28.300
what created this,
what we'd have to admit is a

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:32.433
strong French identity.
But also one of the things I'm

00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:36.306
able to see--I'll probably be in
tears by the end of the lecture

00:24:36.306 --> 00:24:40.240
because I'm so afraid that these
regional identities are going to

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.928
disappear and that tourism may
have something to do with that

00:24:43.928 --> 00:24:45.847
as well,
and that would be too bad,

00:24:45.847 --> 00:24:48.109
with the end of these license
plates and things like that,

00:24:48.109 --> 00:24:52.579
that I mentioned before--that's
not impossible.

00:24:52.579 --> 00:24:55.904
Ironically, those of you,
anyone who's been to France or

00:24:55.904 --> 00:24:58.442
been anywhere,
know that the green Guide

00:24:58.442 --> 00:25:01.190
Michelin,
in a way that may have even

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:04.887
had, along with the gastronomy
guides, as a way of at least

00:25:04.887 --> 00:25:07.819
making people think about
regional culture,

00:25:07.819 --> 00:25:11.147
tying it closely to what is
unique about a region and

00:25:11.147 --> 00:25:15.259
presenting it to tourists,
and what's unique about cuisine.

00:25:15.259 --> 00:25:17.993
And some of the really
famous--and now if you want to

00:25:17.993 --> 00:25:20.621
spend deux cents
cinquante baldis for

00:25:20.621 --> 00:25:23.880
one person to eat in these
places it's $250.00 per person.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:28.796
Some of them have even so
emphasized their local origins

00:25:28.796 --> 00:25:34.248
of what they're preparing that
this may work against this sort

00:25:34.248 --> 00:25:38.450
of onslaught of this single
French culture,

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.332
and so, well,
let all these flowers continue

00:25:41.332 --> 00:25:43.660
to bloom.
Now, what about schools?

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.792
Certainly Weber,
like anyone else,

00:25:45.792 --> 00:25:48.829
is right that schools make a
huge difference.

00:25:48.829 --> 00:25:52.980
And the history of schoolhouses
is very interesting.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:59.424
Now, basically until 1833,
until 1833, and I'll explain

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:04.505
why 1833 in a minute,
there are two things that could

00:26:04.505 --> 00:26:08.799
be said about the teaching of
anything, or three things.

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:13.859
One is that girls were much
less likely to go to school than

00:26:13.859 --> 00:26:15.897
boys;
second, that many

00:26:15.897 --> 00:26:19.954
schoolteachers were
forains which were--or

00:26:19.954 --> 00:26:22.497
mobile.
There are people who simply

00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:26.079
would go from town to town,
teaching for a month or two,

00:26:26.079 --> 00:26:30.485
that villages--some were very
resourceful and would start

00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:35.284
schools, taking advantage of one
of these people--but that the

00:26:35.284 --> 00:26:38.195
church,
education was primarily

00:26:38.195 --> 00:26:42.908
dominated by the Catholic
Church, and education in the

00:26:42.908 --> 00:26:46.617
informal sense as well.
Now, to be sure five percent of

00:26:46.617 --> 00:26:49.051
the French population were
Protestants, more about that

00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:50.720
when we get to the Dreyfus
Affair.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:55.335
But the priest was often,
in the^( )eighteenth century,

00:26:55.335 --> 00:26:59.609
the only person who could read
in many villages,

00:26:59.609 --> 00:27:03.324
and his reading knowledge would
be basically limited to the

00:27:03.324 --> 00:27:06.910
Bible, repeating things that
he'd been trained to say.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:11.437
But the church and the teaching
Sisters, the nuns,

00:27:11.437 --> 00:27:15.410
really dominate,
in many parts of France,

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.674
in places that were still
practicing that old-time

00:27:18.674 --> 00:27:24.419
religion, dominate education.
Now, in 1833 a law comes along

00:27:24.419 --> 00:27:28.912
called the Guizot Law.
Guizot was a Protestant from

00:27:28.912 --> 00:27:30.839
Nimes.
He was not what the French

00:27:30.839 --> 00:27:33.279
would call rigolo,
he was not a very

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:36.879
happy-go-lucky guy that you want
to have a couple of beers with

00:27:36.879 --> 00:27:40.059
or a couple of 7-Ups with.
And he was Protestant,

00:27:40.059 --> 00:27:44.008
and so what he wanted to do was
to wrest education away from the

00:27:44.008 --> 00:27:47.079
clutches of the Catholic Church,
as he saw it.

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:51.813
So, through his inspirations
they pass a law that says that

00:27:51.813 --> 00:27:56.525
in every village in France,
in every one of France's 36,000

00:27:56.525 --> 00:27:59.250
communes, you had to have a
school.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.000
Now, the reality was that many
were so poor that they couldn't.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.477
In our particular village,
and I'll have to make reference

00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:07.519
to this because I've studied it
a little bit,

00:28:07.519 --> 00:28:11.829
the school moves from rented
place to rented place.

00:28:11.829 --> 00:28:16.178
But 1833 matters,
because the schoolteacher now

00:28:16.178 --> 00:28:19.769
has the stamp of official
authority.

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:21.830
He is supposed to teach in
French.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.435
Now, how do you know that?
When I say he has the stamp of

00:28:25.435 --> 00:28:27.670
official authority,
what does that mean?

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:31.365
So, I got curious as to what
that means, and to see what

00:28:31.365 --> 00:28:34.119
difference he made I did the
following,

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:38.301
which is that,
as I said before,

00:28:38.301 --> 00:28:43.426
the big rights of life,
birth, baptism,

00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:47.019
marriage,
death, have to be witnessed.

00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:50.865
And since the French Revolution
this is kept by the State,

00:28:50.865 --> 00:28:54.102
not by the parishes.
So, you have to have people who

00:28:54.102 --> 00:28:56.194
witness it, who say,
"I see this baby,

00:28:56.194 --> 00:28:59.604
I sign on the dotted line."
Now usually what you do in a

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:02.849
small village is you would take
some notable person,

00:29:02.849 --> 00:29:06.944
who knew how to read or write,
perhaps your wealthy uncle,

00:29:06.944 --> 00:29:11.049
or somebody's wealthy uncle,
and then you'd--because the

00:29:11.049 --> 00:29:15.309
person can sign his name--and
then you'd take your cousin,

00:29:15.309 --> 00:29:19.164
who probably couldn't sign his
name, but can make a pretty good

00:29:19.164 --> 00:29:23.063
X, when push comes to shove.
With 1833 I start looking at

00:29:23.063 --> 00:29:25.605
all these registers,
just for a day,

00:29:25.605 --> 00:29:28.569
that'll do it,
but I look at all the births

00:29:28.569 --> 00:29:32.460
and all the baptisms and all the
marriages and all the deaths.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:37.230
And what happens is this proud
signature of the schoolteacher.

00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:40.297
He becomes this sort of,
not obligatory,

00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:44.702
but the chosen person to say,
"I have seen this baby," "I

00:29:44.702 --> 00:29:48.950
have seen this couple," "I have
seen this corpse."

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.619
And does that tell you
something?

00:29:51.619 --> 00:29:54.864
Well, French schoolteachers
still have this wonderful

00:29:54.864 --> 00:29:57.609
signature that my kids who write
terribly,

00:29:57.609 --> 00:30:00.487
have terrible signatures,
like mine, were never able to

00:30:00.487 --> 00:30:02.518
pick up.
But that tells you something

00:30:02.518 --> 00:30:05.677
because he has--he's supposed to
get a minimum salary of two

00:30:05.677 --> 00:30:08.140
hundred francs,
which is virtually nothing;

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.473
some people are paying him in
asparaguses, depending on--or in

00:30:12.473 --> 00:30:15.670
endives or in apples,
or not paying at all.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:19.153
Families that were too poor
were exonerated from having to

00:30:19.153 --> 00:30:22.433
pay anything.
And he's just barely scraping

00:30:22.433 --> 00:30:24.781
by.
But he doesn't have a red,

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:27.890
white and blue sash,
like the mayor does,

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.700
but he represents the State and
the authority,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.690
and above all the prestige of
the State.

00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:40.699
And he's a challenge in his
very existence to the Virgin

00:30:40.699 --> 00:30:44.888
Mary being on the wall of these
public schools,

00:30:44.888 --> 00:30:48.068
these are public schools.
Now, in 1850,

00:30:48.068 --> 00:30:49.891
this is before the course,
it doesn't matter,

00:30:49.891 --> 00:30:51.962
there's a law called the
Falloux Law, which you can

00:30:51.962 --> 00:30:54.908
forget as soon as I said it;
and in the Falloux Law,

00:30:54.908 --> 00:30:58.958
really it's a compromise with
the church, and Louis Napoleon

00:30:58.958 --> 00:31:02.940
hands back control over local
committees to the church.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:08.216
And in parts of France in which
people still practice religion,

00:31:08.216 --> 00:31:12.543
where religion still mattered,
in private and public life,

00:31:12.543 --> 00:31:16.048
to the degree it always had
been, you still have people that

00:31:16.048 --> 00:31:18.805
want to have church schools.
And in the north of

00:31:18.805 --> 00:31:21.454
France--when you're reading
Germinale you have to

00:31:21.454 --> 00:31:24.200
also imagine you've got these
Belgian nuns with these wild

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.410
hats that they used to have,
still teaching in the schools.

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:29.974
You have convent people coming
down that know a little

00:31:29.974 --> 00:31:32.297
literacy, not very much,
and they're teaching and

00:31:32.297 --> 00:31:35.456
they're doing the best they can.
The quality of the clergy in

00:31:35.456 --> 00:31:38.289
France was never higher than in
the eighteenth century;

00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:40.509
it was pretty low in the
nineteenth century.

00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:45.526
But still you have these
competing sources to educate the

00:31:45.526 --> 00:31:49.812
young people.
Now, parents often resist their

00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:53.789
kids going to school.
Why would they want to do that?

00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:56.920
Well, mothers are responsible
for the household economy.

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.880
You have to have enough money
to keep the household going.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.792
And for very many people,
and not just workers and

00:32:03.792 --> 00:32:07.298
peasants, it was difficult to
explain what difference in the

00:32:07.298 --> 00:32:10.805
long run that mattered if their
child learned how to do more

00:32:10.805 --> 00:32:14.490
than the very minimum of
learning how to read and write.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.762
So, I got ahold of some
statistics on truancy,

00:32:16.762 --> 00:32:18.934
for example,
and that was pretty interesting

00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:21.135
to see.
And it's quite clear that

00:32:21.135 --> 00:32:24.952
whenever there was a harvest,
a silkworm harvest in much of

00:32:24.952 --> 00:32:29.130
the southeast of France,
a wine harvest in Champagne or

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:33.769
in Burgundy or in Bordeaux or
Languedoc, almost anywhere,

00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:36.008
or the various harvests that
begin in July,

00:32:36.008 --> 00:32:38.621
usually with the grain,
the kids just didn't go to

00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:41.019
school because they weren't
needed there.

00:32:41.019 --> 00:32:43.947
But there's always this
tension, because parents said,

00:32:43.947 --> 00:32:45.880
"my little girl should be in
CP,"

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.393
or "my little boy should be in
CP," which is the equivalent of

00:32:48.393 --> 00:32:50.833
first grade,
"but I need her," or "I need

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:54.480
him to watch the small animals."
The big kids watch the big

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.391
animals, that's the way it is.
The big kids go on the

00:32:57.391 --> 00:32:59.937
transhumance;
that is when you take the sheep

00:32:59.937 --> 00:33:02.369
up into the mountains.
We still have that.

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:04.902
Every year we still--my kids go
on the tour, or at least one of

00:33:04.902 --> 00:33:06.372
them goes on the
transhumance,

00:33:06.372 --> 00:33:08.210
with the sheep going up in the
mountains.

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.549
And they would say there's no
way I'm sending my kid to

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:11.638
school.
But in France,

00:33:11.638 --> 00:33:13.684
as you'll read from Chip
Sowerwine's book,

00:33:13.684 --> 00:33:15.730
they put in laws,
as they do in Italy,

00:33:15.730 --> 00:33:18.141
as they do in Germany,
and as they do in Britain,

00:33:18.141 --> 00:33:20.050
that says you don't have any
choice,

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.482
pas du choix;
you have to go to school,

00:33:23.482 --> 00:33:28.051
and you have to be there until
the age of eleven or the age of

00:33:28.051 --> 00:33:30.654
twelve.
So, the assumption is,

00:33:30.654 --> 00:33:34.195
in this kind of view of how
this all works,

00:33:34.195 --> 00:33:37.168
is that these guys,
these teachers,

00:33:37.168 --> 00:33:40.747
male teachers--increasingly
women teachers later,

00:33:40.747 --> 00:33:42.965
but only later,
it becomes a job along

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:44.877
with--well we'll talk about this
some other time,

00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:46.390
along with department store
clerks,

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:49.909
and when clerks becoming more
female as opposed to male,

00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:53.748
it becomes a way for peasant
girls and working class girls or

00:33:53.748 --> 00:33:57.127
young women to get jobs.
But the view is that these

00:33:57.127 --> 00:34:00.240
teachers, who are called
instits in French,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.812
instituteurs,
but just teachers,

00:34:01.812 --> 00:34:03.922
these primary school
teachers--virtually nobody went

00:34:03.922 --> 00:34:06.470
to lycée,
goes to high school;

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.970
hardly anyone goes to
lycée until,

00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:12.109
really until the second half of
the nineteenth century--that

00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:14.769
these people are teaching the
French language,

00:34:14.769 --> 00:34:17.150
and that this is how you're
going to learn it.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:21.514
And there's always a story told
almost everyplace how in school,

00:34:21.514 --> 00:34:24.394
even during recess,
recreation, recess,

00:34:24.394 --> 00:34:29.042
the last person who says a word
in patois has to clutch for the

00:34:29.042 --> 00:34:33.389
remainder of the period some
oddly shaped rock or coin,

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:37.370
until somebody else screws up
and says a word in patois.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:41.439
Are you kidding me?
It doesn't work like that at

00:34:41.439 --> 00:34:44.517
all.
Jean-François Chanet

00:34:44.517 --> 00:34:49.890
started, he went out to study,
in the 1850s and '60s and

00:34:49.890 --> 00:34:52.676
1870s,
schoolteachers and schools,

00:34:52.676 --> 00:34:56.420
and he begins with surveys,
some of which I've read.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.134
They asked schoolteachers,
"what do you want for yourself,

00:35:00.134 --> 00:35:03.133
what do want for your village,
for your school,

00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:05.740
and what do you want for your
kids?"

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.597
And they would reply.
But these guys,

00:35:09.597 --> 00:35:12.487
they're filling out forms that
their superiors in this

00:35:12.487 --> 00:35:15.111
hierarchical,
centralized society are going

00:35:15.111 --> 00:35:18.191
to look at, and if they write,
"basically they don't

00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:21.660
understand French,
we talk about the great battles

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.280
of Napoleon, but we do it in
Auvergnat, in patois,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.639
or we do it in Languedocien or
we do it in Catalan,

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:30.000
then they're going to get
themselves in trouble.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.611
So, you have to sort of sneak
around a little bit these

00:35:33.611 --> 00:35:36.224
sources.
And the more Chanet looked at

00:35:36.224 --> 00:35:38.705
these places,
it's clear that regional

00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:41.119
identity is still very
important.

00:35:41.119 --> 00:35:45.571
The famous map of France or the
famous map of the world that

00:35:45.571 --> 00:35:48.889
had, in the 1890s,
after the big period of New

00:35:48.889 --> 00:35:52.842
Imperialism, you have the color
of France in its colonies in

00:35:52.842 --> 00:35:56.929
Senegal or what now is Mali or
Réunion or anywhere.

00:35:56.929 --> 00:35:59.579
But you have to begin with a
region.

00:35:59.579 --> 00:36:01.190
And so they're beginning with a
region.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:03.916
If they're from the Heyraud,
if they're from Montpellier or

00:36:03.916 --> 00:36:06.078
from around Montpellier,
that is their frame of

00:36:06.078 --> 00:36:08.602
identity.
And so it's absurd to think

00:36:08.602 --> 00:36:12.570
that they weren't actually
teaching in these languages,

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:16.507
local languages and dialects,
in patois, just as it's absurd

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:19.710
to think that people who didn't
master French,

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.010
perfectly, or even very well at
all, didn't have some,

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.199
depending on the timing,
some sense of being French.

00:36:26.199 --> 00:36:29.360
So, these schools are terribly
important.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.462
And they could be teaching
about all this stuff they had to

00:36:32.462 --> 00:36:35.564
learn about the kings of France
and all this crap that they

00:36:35.564 --> 00:36:37.679
still learn,
over and over again.

00:36:37.679 --> 00:36:40.710
And they're teaching that stuff
in patois and in dialect.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.725
And maybe in the north of
France--you have to--everybody's

00:36:43.725 --> 00:36:46.264
always talking about this
imaginary line from St.

00:36:46.264 --> 00:36:48.539
Malo to Geneva,
here, and it's mostly in the

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:51.289
south of France where these
languages persist,

00:36:51.289 --> 00:36:54.393
and I don't mean persist in a
derogatory sense but where they

00:36:54.393 --> 00:36:59.553
continue to thrive.
But this bilingualism will

00:36:59.553 --> 00:37:03.926
continue.
And also, a lot of the views of

00:37:03.926 --> 00:37:09.538
these sort of backward provinces
are written by Parisians or by

00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:11.957
military officers,
for example,

00:37:11.957 --> 00:37:14.500
who shop, and they find some
peasant walking down the street

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.008
and they say,
"hey you,

00:37:16.008 --> 00:37:17.800
can you give me this
information?"

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:21.466
And that person understands
perfectly well what they want

00:37:21.466 --> 00:37:24.019
but they identify some person
coming,

00:37:24.019 --> 00:37:26.056
speaking French,
as a tax collector or a

00:37:26.056 --> 00:37:28.039
military guy or something like
that,

00:37:28.039 --> 00:37:30.834
and you're apt just to give
that secret smile and pretend

00:37:30.834 --> 00:37:32.880
like you don't understand a damn
thing,

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.581
just a secret smile.
And then they go back and they

00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:37.691
write, "boy, I've never--these
people here they can't speak

00:37:37.691 --> 00:37:39.284
French at all,
they are hopeless,

00:37:39.284 --> 00:37:41.668
they are out of date,
they are plooks,

00:37:41.668 --> 00:37:44.179
they are bumpkins,"
and all of that.

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:47.130
So, but eventually,
as I said, you have these

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:50.349
schoolhouses that they will
improve over time,

00:37:50.349 --> 00:37:52.960
they get more resources,
they're made to have more

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:55.849
resources.
The towns do more and more for

00:37:55.849 --> 00:37:58.501
them.
Girls schools start up,

00:37:58.501 --> 00:38:02.904
girls education increases
rapidly and thus it's

00:38:02.904 --> 00:38:06.707
quite--another Zola novel,
which is a great one,

00:38:06.707 --> 00:38:09.201
called Au Bonheur des
Dames, which is about a

00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:11.719
department store,
it's about the department store

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:13.159
Bon Marché,
in Paris.

00:38:13.159 --> 00:38:15.707
For these young women get
really miserable jobs,

00:38:15.707 --> 00:38:18.960
and what they're doing is
they're sleeping in dormitories,

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.568
under horrible,
sort of draconian regulations

00:38:21.568 --> 00:38:24.119
about what they can do.
But for them to get those kinds

00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:26.224
of jobs they have to be able to
count, they have to be able to

00:38:26.224 --> 00:38:27.570
read, they have to be able to
write.

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:32.855
And so women's education
increases dramatically during

00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:37.470
this whole time.
But what does not change is the

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:42.837
prestige that the schoolteachers
have, that they maintain as

00:38:42.837 --> 00:38:47.931
representing not only national
identity but also regional

00:38:47.931 --> 00:38:54.183
possibilities,
and in teaching the youth of

00:38:54.183 --> 00:38:59.973
France how to read and write.
Now, I thought,

00:38:59.973 --> 00:39:03.808
just because maybe you'll find
it interesting for the last ten

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:06.281
minutes,
since I did what I basically

00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:10.099
wanted to do and held myself
down in not giving countless and

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:15.039
countless examples,
is talk a little bit about now.

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:20.079
Because one of the things that
I became interested in is how,

00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:23.850
if these areas in the south,
particularly,

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.891
that are tourist infested,
during the year,

00:39:27.891 --> 00:39:32.990
if they are going to remain
more than simply sites for

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:37.300
tourists from the north,
from Belgium and from Germany

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.185
and from the Netherlands and
literally from the north of

00:39:40.185 --> 00:39:42.299
France,
to come and visit,

00:39:42.299 --> 00:39:47.773
schools have to maintain their
traditional role in representing

00:39:47.773 --> 00:39:51.039
the identity of these
communities.

00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:53.423
And those of you who are--if
there are any people here from

00:39:53.423 --> 00:39:56.696
Nebraska, where my wife is from,
or from Idaho or from Oregon,

00:39:56.696 --> 00:39:58.961
where I'm from,
from Eastern Oregon,

00:39:58.961 --> 00:40:01.550
or from Wyoming and places like
that,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:05.468
will know the process by which
schools are closing down,

00:40:05.468 --> 00:40:08.389
because there are not enough
kids left.

00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:16.044
France had in 1851--two-thirds
of the departments in France in

00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:24.199
1851 were larger than they were
in 1939, because of two things;

00:40:24.199 --> 00:40:29.088
one, the collapsing birthrate,
which I will talk about another

00:40:29.088 --> 00:40:31.506
time.
In much of France people

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:34.213
stopped having babies,
point,

00:40:34.213 --> 00:40:38.467
period, or they'll have 2.1
babies or 1.8 babies--that's

00:40:38.467 --> 00:40:41.960
kind of hard,
but statistically.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.743
And second is that what in
French you call le grand

00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:46.949
départ,
or the big departure,

00:40:46.949 --> 00:40:50.069
starts, as people who have lost
access to common resources,

00:40:50.069 --> 00:40:51.789
for example,
in the mountains,

00:40:51.789 --> 00:40:54.457
or the silk industry collapse
or the wine industry

00:40:54.457 --> 00:40:58.050
collapses--more about that when
I talk about phylloxera disease;

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:02.212
don't write that down or even
try to spell it now--there is

00:41:02.212 --> 00:41:05.944
this huge withdrawal from the
countryside toward more

00:41:05.944 --> 00:41:09.591
urbanized departments,
and because the population has

00:41:09.591 --> 00:41:12.799
stopped growing basically by
1900, if it wasn't for the

00:41:12.799 --> 00:41:15.710
arrival of people from Italy and
other places,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.757
and from Spain,
the French population wouldn't

00:41:18.757 --> 00:41:22.550
even reproduce itself,
it wouldn't even stay constant.

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:28.191
In much of France,
and indeed I would argue of

00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:33.958
36,000 communes,
let me say that perhaps in ten

00:41:33.958 --> 00:41:39.586
or twelve thousand communes,
after World War II,

00:41:39.586 --> 00:41:42.480
there were one-room
schoolhouses.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:45.339
And a one-room schoolhouse you
know, you've seen movies

00:41:45.339 --> 00:41:47.422
involving them.
They have them in the United

00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.308
States too.
In a one-room schoolhouse

00:41:49.308 --> 00:41:52.066
you'll have all the kids,
have all the grades being

00:41:52.066 --> 00:41:55.284
taught by one person.
Our kids were several years in

00:41:55.284 --> 00:41:58.179
a one-room schoolhouse.
It's a great way to grow up.

00:41:58.179 --> 00:42:01.012
In France you have grades
from^( )first through^( )fifth

00:42:01.012 --> 00:42:03.588
grade, they're called CP
un, CP deux,

00:42:03.588 --> 00:42:05.953
et cetera.
And the oldest kid,

00:42:05.953 --> 00:42:09.669
if he or she is remotely
intelligent, will help with the

00:42:09.669 --> 00:42:12.641
younger ones,
but everybody's together in the

00:42:12.641 --> 00:42:15.291
same school.
And with the depopulation,

00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:18.410
what they did is they tried to
have single sex schools,

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.010
you have a boys school and a
girls school.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.126
But that becomes too expensive,
because the State is paying for

00:42:24.126 --> 00:42:26.639
all this and the communes are
paying part of it.

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:28.527
So, what they do is they say,
okay, we're going to have one

00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:30.202
school.
It's called in French a

00:42:30.202 --> 00:42:33.087
classe unique,
and it's a wonderful way to

00:42:33.087 --> 00:42:36.573
grow up in--where you've got
cats and you have dogs and you

00:42:36.573 --> 00:42:40.480
have the older kids are trying
to get ready for their exams;

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:43.764
they don't have it anymore,
but a brevet to show

00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:47.535
that through a certificate that
they have been in class through

00:42:47.535 --> 00:42:50.820
our equivalent here in America
of the fifth grade,

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:53.336
and you might have a--if they
have a kindergarten you might

00:42:53.336 --> 00:42:55.550
have a little boy or a girl
peeing in the corner,

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:58.469
literally, while all this other
stuff is going on.

00:42:58.469 --> 00:43:04.032
In our class a dog gave birth
during the middle of math in our

00:43:04.032 --> 00:43:07.739
class in this school.
And all of the tests that

00:43:07.739 --> 00:43:11.344
people have had show that kids
with--who come out of that

00:43:11.344 --> 00:43:14.619
environment do just as well,
in fact even a little better,

00:43:14.619 --> 00:43:17.177
than people in your normal
class where you've got everybody

00:43:17.177 --> 00:43:19.060
in^( )the first grade,
there they all are,

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.485
and here's the second grade,
and you've got sort of an elite

00:43:21.485 --> 00:43:23.910
class for those people whose
parents are pushy enough to get

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:25.948
them in that;
and you got all that stuff,

00:43:25.948 --> 00:43:29.060
and some of which you've seen.
But as all this is expensive

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:32.532
what's happened over time is
that these one-room schoolhouses

00:43:32.532 --> 00:43:36.762
are closing down.
And between 1975 about,

00:43:36.762 --> 00:43:45.044
and about let's say 1990,10,000
one-room schoolhouses in France

00:43:45.044 --> 00:43:48.226
closed.
And what this does is it causes

00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:51.918
unemployment for schoolteachers
but many of them can stay on in

00:43:51.918 --> 00:43:54.529
other capacities.
But it means that there are

00:43:54.529 --> 00:43:56.544
long bus rides;
they are already long bus rides

00:43:56.544 --> 00:43:58.212
because many
départements don't

00:43:58.212 --> 00:44:00.409
have that many high schools and
you've got to take buses in

00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:01.850
order to get to the high
schools,

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:06.548
and that sort of thing.
And that is sad because that's

00:44:06.548 --> 00:44:11.269
a wonderful way to grow up,
in these schools.

00:44:11.269 --> 00:44:14.216
And that's part of regional
identity and village identity

00:44:14.216 --> 00:44:17.056
that's going to disappear.
And let me give you an example,

00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:19.260
again from our village,
because it's interesting.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.214
We were faced with the fact
that the school was going to be

00:44:24.214 --> 00:44:28.741
either grouped with another
village, a detested rival,

00:44:28.741 --> 00:44:31.707
or be shut down.
So, what are our kids supposed

00:44:31.707 --> 00:44:33.719
to do, where are they supposed
to go to school?

00:44:33.719 --> 00:44:37.199
And one day we were convoked to
the town hall,

00:44:37.199 --> 00:44:40.679
to the mairie,
by our schoolteacher.

00:44:40.679 --> 00:44:44.406
And our--most of our parents'
meetings with the schoolteacher

00:44:44.406 --> 00:44:47.574
ended with a bottle of armagnac,
I'm pleased to say,

00:44:47.574 --> 00:44:50.819
and we're all dear friends;
even the people that you're not

00:44:50.819 --> 00:44:52.650
dear friends with you got along
with fine.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.969
But remember what I said about
the role of the school.

00:44:54.969 --> 00:44:58.029
The school represented,
from the outside,

00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:01.699
France looking into the
village, in principle,

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:04.142
teaching French,
providing opportunities for

00:45:04.142 --> 00:45:07.209
people to get educated,
get a job in the post office or

00:45:07.209 --> 00:45:10.390
the train station or in a
department store in Paris,

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:14.812
Avignon, Toulouse or wherever.
And one day we were convoked by

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.690
the mayor, and the mayor then
wasn't a friend of ours,

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.217
just somebody we knew,
and he had a sash on,

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:22.980
and he said vous instead
of tu,

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:26.726
he spoke to us formally.
And the teacher was nervous,

00:45:26.726 --> 00:45:28.996
he said, "God," he said,
"we have the great pleasure of

00:45:28.996 --> 00:45:30.510
having Monsieur la
Maire."

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:32.456
And we're all looking at him
and saying, "Quoi?,

00:45:32.456 --> 00:45:34.598
qu'est-ceâ€¦?"
"Monsieur la Maire is

00:45:34.598 --> 00:45:36.392
going to hear,
he's going to be here to talk

00:45:36.392 --> 00:45:38.055
to us."
And we'll all a little nervous

00:45:38.055 --> 00:45:40.090
because our school is maybe
going to close down.

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.272
We'd started a semi-illegal
cantine to feed the kids,

00:45:43.272 --> 00:45:46.293
lunchrooms so that parents
wouldn't put their kids in the

00:45:46.293 --> 00:45:48.557
other school.
At one point we had like nine

00:45:48.557 --> 00:45:50.833
kids left in the school,
we could get closed down,

00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:53.416
and we were a little nervous.
And the guy says,

00:45:53.416 --> 00:45:56.512
"my friends," which he's not,
we're not--he said,

00:45:56.512 --> 00:46:00.382
"we are gathered here together
so that we can best see how we

00:46:00.382 --> 00:46:03.750
can cheat the State."
And the minute he said cheat

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:07.251
the State we had an alliance,
all of us, because how are we

00:46:07.251 --> 00:46:10.751
going to keep a semi-illegal
lunchroom going so that we can

00:46:10.751 --> 00:46:13.770
keep a couple more little kids
in our school,

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.642
how are we going to do that?
And I realized then that the

00:46:16.642 --> 00:46:19.463
relationship had totally
changed, that the school still

00:46:19.463 --> 00:46:22.323
represents France.
It's a cruel system where you'd

00:46:22.323 --> 00:46:25.792
be in the fourth grade and your
teachers will call the parents

00:46:25.792 --> 00:46:28.579
and say, "votre fille,
elle est nulle."

00:46:28.579 --> 00:46:30.553
That happened to one of my
daughter's friends--your

00:46:30.553 --> 00:46:32.957
daughter, she's nothing,
she has to go off and do this

00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:35.712
menial job because she's never
going to make it to the next

00:46:35.712 --> 00:46:37.435
level.
There's always tension in these

00:46:37.435 --> 00:46:39.630
parents' meetings.
It's a cruel system.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:42.657
But it was the outside looking
in, it represented the

00:46:42.657 --> 00:46:46.034
possibilities of France and the
French language which we've

00:46:46.034 --> 00:46:49.009
already--we've exaggerated.
And I suddenly realized that

00:46:49.009 --> 00:46:51.179
now it was very different,
and that if our village,

00:46:51.179 --> 00:46:55.380
like all these other villages,
are going to remain living,

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:58.548
vivant,
and more than just a Michelin

00:46:58.548 --> 00:47:02.822
infused speck on the dot where
people come along with their

00:47:02.822 --> 00:47:07.096
green guides because it's so
beautiful--and this is true of

00:47:07.096 --> 00:47:10.484
all of these places;
they're not all equally

00:47:10.484 --> 00:47:12.960
beautiful--that our school has
to survive.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.475
Because even people whose
families have hated each other's

00:47:15.475 --> 00:47:18.146
guts for generations,
who detest each other,

00:47:18.146 --> 00:47:22.211
all agree that since the church
is now just a voluntary

00:47:22.211 --> 00:47:25.522
association like any other,
like  the

00:47:25.522 --> 00:47:28.810
pétanque club,
the boule club,

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:31.916
or the fut club,
I mean the soccer club,

00:47:31.916 --> 00:47:35.196
that the only thing that
arguably will hold the village

00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:38.780
together is the identity that
comes through this school,

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:43.190
the school of this particular
village which is called Balazuc.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:47.655
So, just simply in conclusion
let's not exaggerate this one

00:47:47.655 --> 00:47:51.273
national identity,
nor assume that modernization

00:47:51.273 --> 00:47:55.862
has to come crashing along.
Let us realize the complexity

00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:59.810
of national and regional
identities, which can become

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:02.642
intertwined,
which are intertwined,

00:48:02.642 --> 00:48:07.181
and let us realize that these
schools have a remarkable role

00:48:07.181 --> 00:48:12.245
still in these communities,
terribly important at the most

00:48:12.245 --> 00:48:17.389
basic level, and that remains in
France, neighborhood and

00:48:17.389 --> 00:48:21.000
village.
See you on Wednesday.

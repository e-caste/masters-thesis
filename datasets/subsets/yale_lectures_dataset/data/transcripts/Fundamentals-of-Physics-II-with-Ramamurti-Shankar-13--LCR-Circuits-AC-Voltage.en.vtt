00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.162
Prof: I thought I would
go back a little bit to LCR

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:08.080
circuits.
 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.999
I think that's one of the more
useful things you learn in this

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.430
course.
 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.309
I want to do it carefully so
everyone's on top of that.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.581
So remember that the problem
you want to solve looks like

00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:22.240
this.
 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.880
That's an AC source.
 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.540
That is a resistor.
 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.470
There's an inductor and a
capacitor.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.350
And that's the circuit.
 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.384
And this voltage we take to be
V_0

00:00:43.384 --> 00:00:46.120
cosωt.
 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.926
That's the kind of voltage that
will come out of any AC

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:49.550
generator.
 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.170
The omega is controlled by how
the turbine is spinning.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.910
That frequency is the same as
this frequency.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.329
Our job is to find the current
in the circuit.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.728
Now what makes it difficult is
that,

00:01:03.728 --> 00:01:07.762
unlike DC circuits where you
take a voltage and divide by

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:11.581
some effective resistance,
the equations here are not

00:01:11.581 --> 00:01:14.780
algebraic equations but
differential equations.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.659
So we'll write it down then
I'll tell you how we handle it.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.750
So the equation for this
circuit, you begin as usual,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.909
you go around the whole loop
and you add everything to 0,

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.945
then you will find
V_0

00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:34.593
cosωt =
R times I L

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:41.123
times dI/dt  1 over
integral of I up to time t

00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:44.330
times 1/C.
 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.840
That's the voltage.
 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.700
Everybody with me on that part?
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.128
That determines the condition,
that determines the current at

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:55.900
every instant in time.
 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.516
So if you can solve this
equation, you solve for the

00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:01.492
current, but what's difficult is
that it's not an algebraic

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:02.159
equation.
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.745
It's not like V = IR,
where you divide by R,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:05.879
you've got the current.
 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.699
This has got integrals,
it's got derivatives.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:11.985
But it turns out that if the
voltage is V_0

00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:15.425
cosωt,
there's a very clever way to

00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:19.079
solve this problem,
which takes it back almost to

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.860
the good old days of V =
IR.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.810
No differentials,
no integrals,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.460
nothing.
 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.158
That's the magic.
 

00:02:25.158 --> 00:02:28.086
That was invented by an
engineer from GE called

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:28.848
Steinmetz.
 

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:32.187
He put to work some ideas that
may seem esoteric,

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:35.941
because they involve complex
numbers, but it makes life

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:39.139
tolerable for people doing
circuit theory.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:43.091
And here is the trick:
I ignore this problem,

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:47.852
and I solve the following
problem, purely mathematical

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:48.840
device.
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.604
The problem I solve has a
voltage V_0

00:02:53.604 --> 00:02:55.550
e^(Iωt).
 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.408
We all realize that you cannot
get a source that does that,

00:02:58.408 --> 00:02:59.788
but it's pure mathematics.
 

00:02:59.788 --> 00:03:07.717
Then the solution to that
problem, that voltage,

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:17.669
I assume, will drive some
current I call I˜.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.506
So I˜ is the
answer to the problem where the

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:26.990
driving voltage is not real,
but this, if you mathematically

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.699
write the same equation.
 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:34.340
But now we realize that
I˜ can be complex.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.650
I˜ is not real.
 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.348
It can be a complex number.
 

00:03:38.348 --> 00:03:40.460
Just because the voltage is a
complex number,

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.595
it's an equation,
it's got imaginary and real

00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:45.160
parts on the left hand side,
it will have imaginary and real

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.396
parts on the right hand side,
and so you'll need both to make

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.610
it work.
 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:58.355
But if you have solved this
problem, I claim you have also

00:03:58.355 --> 00:04:00.960
solved this problem.
 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.878
Why?
 

00:04:01.878 --> 00:04:03.568
Because if you take this
equation,

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:06.665
which is a complex equation,
then the real part on the left

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:09.870
hand side will match the real
part on the right hand side.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.758
Imaginary part will match the
imaginary part.

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:14.520
That's because if you have two
complex numbers,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.240
z_1 and you
say they're equal,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.026
you mean x_1
Iy_1 is

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.329
x_2
Iy_2.

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:25.973
And they can be equal only if
these guys are equal,

00:04:25.973 --> 00:04:27.649
those guys are equal.
 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:29.839
The real part has to match,
the imaginary part has to.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.009
You cannot borrow from the real
part and give to the imaginary

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:32.259
part.
 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.519
They're apples and they're
oranges, so you've got to match

00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.550
them separately.
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.129
The closest analog is a vector
equation.

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:41.797
If you have a vector equation
and you equate two vectors,

00:04:41.797 --> 00:04:44.386
so you say vector
F is m times

00:04:44.386 --> 00:04:46.526
vector a,
then F_x will

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:47.904
be m times
a_x and

00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:49.315
F_y will be
m times

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:50.190
a_y.
 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.980
So there are two equations in
one single vector equation,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.372
three in 3D and a complex
equation, there are two

00:04:55.372 --> 00:04:56.069
equations.
 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.434
So let's take the equivalent of
the real part in the left hand

00:04:59.434 --> 00:05:01.915
side and the real part in the
right hand side,

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:03.240
and what do you get?
 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.639
The real part of this is the
most important thing.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.879
The real part of this is
cosωt.

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:10.790
that's because
e^(iωt) is

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.319
cosωt 
isinωt.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.028
The real part is just
cosωt.

00:05:16.028 --> 00:05:19.223
On the right hand side,
I should take R times the real

00:05:19.223 --> 00:05:20.790
part of I˜.
 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.480
Let me just call that guy
I.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.714
Then I should take L
times the derivative of the real

00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:29.839
part of I˜,
which I want to call I.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.125
Then 1/C times the
integral of the real part of

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:35.110
I˜,
the real part of

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.839
I˜ I want to call
I.

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:42.166
In other words,
let the real part of

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:46.740
I˜ be called
I.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.077
Then we notice that this
I is exactly the I

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:52.240
that we want.
 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.910
It satisfies exactly the
equation we want to solve.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.290
So we have some good news and
some bad news.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.666
The good news is that if you
solve this equation,

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:06.129
you've also solved this
equation.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.036
The bad news is,
if you cannot even solve the

00:06:09.036 --> 00:06:11.812
real equation,
what makes you think you can

00:06:11.812 --> 00:06:14.389
solve this complex equation,
right?

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.800
I cooked up another problem
that looks even more difficult

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.492
and I say, "Hey,
if you can do that,

00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:19.550
we can do this."
 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.071
Well, it turns out this complex
problem is actually easier to

00:06:24.071 --> 00:06:25.730
solve than this guy.
 

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.810
I'll try to tell you why it's
easier to solve.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.382
If you come to this equation,
I've told you repeatedly,

00:06:32.382 --> 00:06:35.293
any equation involving
derivatives and so on,

00:06:35.293 --> 00:06:38.139
you guess the answer and you
put it in.

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.699
You try to make a guess.
 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.648
I'm trying to guess,
what kind of function I(t)

00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:47.259
has the property that when I
multiply it by R,

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.259
I should get a
cosωt,

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.310
when I differentiate,
I should get something like

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.242
cosωt,
when I integrate,

00:06:53.242 --> 00:06:55.170
I should get
cosωt?

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.839
That's the only way left and
right will match,

00:06:57.839 --> 00:07:00.689
and neither cosine nor sine
will do the trick.

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.196
If you pick the sine,
then when you differentiate it,

00:07:03.196 --> 00:07:04.980
you will get a cosine that
matches.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.642
This one integrated,
you will get a cosine that

00:07:07.642 --> 00:07:10.250
matches this,
but this will contain a sine.

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.180
On the other hand here,
since this exponential,

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.370
if you make the choice
I˜(t),

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:24.720
it's I˜_0
e^(iωt),

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.829
it is going to work.
 

00:07:26.829 --> 00:07:29.769
It is going to work because if
you take R times that,

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:31.663
you get R times
I_0

00:07:31.663 --> 00:07:32.759
e^(iωt).
 

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:35.865
If you take the derivative of
this guy, that's Iω

00:07:35.865 --> 00:07:37.139
times the same current.
 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.490
Integral is 1 over
Iω times the same

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.050
thing.
 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.757
That's the beautiful property
of the exponential,

00:07:43.757 --> 00:07:46.860
that when you differentiate it,
just like multiplying by

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.990
iω.
 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.956
When you integrate it,
it's like dividing by

00:07:49.956 --> 00:07:51.785
iω,
and when you multiply by

00:07:51.785 --> 00:07:53.980
R, it's like multiplying
by R.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.601
So if you take this assumed
solution and put it into that

00:07:57.601 --> 00:07:59.800
equation, let's see what we get.
 

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.043
We get e_0
e^(iωt) = (now

00:08:03.043 --> 00:08:06.348
allow me to jump one or two
steps, because I did it last

00:08:06.348 --> 00:08:06.889
time.
 

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:09.129
Try to do this in your head.)
 

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:15.048
R times I˜
is going to contain R

00:08:15.048 --> 00:08:20.149
times I˜_0
e^(iωt).

00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:22.430
How about L times
dI˜/dt,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.815
then I come with the
d/dt, this guy is a

00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:25.490
constant.
 

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.000
This brings me an
Iω,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.879
so I write IωL
times the same thing.

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:36.904
When I integrate,
I get 1 over Iω

00:08:36.904 --> 00:08:41.820
times the 1/C that looks
like that.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.799
So the time dependence,
this is a time dependent

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:48.351
problem, but miraculously,
time dependence matches on the

00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.240
two sides.
 

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:59.178
And now we get this equation,
V_0 = R iωL

00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:07.940
1/iωC times
I˜_0.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.340
And our goal was to find
I˜_0,

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.677
so I˜_0 =
V_0 divided by

00:09:15.677 --> 00:09:18.080
this complex number Z.
 

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.009
This complex number Z is
called the impedance,

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:26.707
and it = R iωL
1/iωC,

00:09:26.707 --> 00:09:28.700
for this problem.
 

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.960
I'm not telling you the answer
for every problem,

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:34.950
but for this problem,
life is very simple.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:39.399
You find that current as a
voltage divided by a number,

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:42.120
just like dividing by R.
 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.019
The only trick is,
there are two catches now.

00:09:44.019 --> 00:09:46.847
First catch is,
this number is not real,

00:09:46.847 --> 00:09:51.198
so you've got to get used to
the fact that you will work with

00:09:51.198 --> 00:09:52.649
complex numbers.
 

00:09:52.649 --> 00:09:55.620
If you're willing to work with
them, you get this.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.176
Second thing is,
this is not the current we were

00:09:58.176 --> 00:09:59.210
supposed to find.
 

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.600
What's the current we were
supposed to find?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.996
The current that I wanted was
the real part of this

00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:08.940
I˜.
 

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:14.629
That means it's the real part
of I˜_0

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:19.740
e^(iωt) divided
by--sorry.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.309
That's correct.
 

00:10:20.309 --> 00:10:22.548
That's what I want.
 

00:10:22.548 --> 00:10:28.971
And that's going to be then the
real part of V_0

00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:32.610
over Z e^(iωt).
 

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:34.639
We always pick V_0
to be a real number.

00:10:34.639 --> 00:10:38.422
The amplitude on the voltage
you can take it to be a real

00:10:38.422 --> 00:10:39.029
number.
 

00:10:39.029 --> 00:10:43.418
Then you write it as a real
part of V_0

00:10:43.418 --> 00:10:46.850
divided by Z
e^(i)^(Φ).

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.580
So I should tell you what this
is.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.899
I'm saying, imagine the complex
number Z, plotted this way.

00:10:52.899 --> 00:10:57.807
This is R, this is iωL
− 1/i −

00:10:57.807 --> 00:11:02.224
i/ωC,
and this is the complex number

00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:03.500
Z.
 

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.798
This is the angle Φ.
 

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:11.240
Then you write the same complex
number in polar form as a

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.875
modulus and e^(i)^
(Φ). So now you

00:11:16.875 --> 00:11:21.150
find I of t is the
real part of

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.815
V_0 over mod
Z e^(iωt -

00:11:25.815 --> 00:11:30.433
)^(Φ),
and that we know is

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:35.278
V_0 over mod Z
cos(ωt −

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:39.692
Φ).
 So that's the final

00:11:39.692 --> 00:11:40.230
result.
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.279
That's the answer to the
original question.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:48.445
Now you know trigonometry well
enough to know that

00:11:48.445 --> 00:11:51.676
cos(ωt −
Φ) is

00:11:51.676 --> 00:11:54.259
really cosωt
cosΦ

00:11:54.259 --> 00:11:56.908
sinωt
sinΦ.

00:11:56.908 --> 00:11:59.548
So the answer cannot be just a
cos and cannot be a sine.

00:11:59.548 --> 00:12:03.399
It's a suitably chosen
admixture of sines and cosines

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:05.028
that does the trick.
 

00:12:05.028 --> 00:12:06.863
So if you want to,
if you say, "I don't want

00:12:06.863 --> 00:12:08.123
to deal with complex
numbers"

00:12:08.123 --> 00:12:10.528
you can take a guess like this
and put it in the equation,

00:12:10.528 --> 00:12:11.975
and after a lot of
manipulation,

00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:14.726
you will find there is a
Φ satisfying this

00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:15.379
condition.
 

00:12:15.379 --> 00:12:16.990
What's the property of
Φ?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.484
Tan of Φ is
ωL −

00:12:21.484 --> 00:12:25.538
1/ωC divided by
R.

00:12:25.538 --> 00:12:29.239
But the beauty of the complex
numbers is, it just comes out in

00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:32.090
one package as the phase of a
complex number.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:36.410
I also told you to think about
how you could do this with real

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.120
numbers.
 

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.179
It's not going to be easy to
take a voltage,

00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:42.946
which is cosωt,
divided by anything,

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:45.313
to get a current which is
cos(ωt −

00:12:45.313 --> 00:12:46.350
Φ).
 

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:49.452
There's nothing you can do to a
cosine which will shift its

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:49.879
phase.
 

00:12:49.879 --> 00:12:52.100
But if you're working with
complex numbers,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.602
you can take e^(iωt)
divided by

00:12:54.602 --> 00:12:58.154
e^(i)^(Φ) and
turn it into e^(iωt -

00:12:58.154 --> 00:12:59.610
)^(Φ).
 

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.738
So in the imaginary world,
it's very easy to shift the

00:13:02.738 --> 00:13:04.557
phase,
because a complex number,

00:13:04.557 --> 00:13:06.980
when it multiplies or divides
another number,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.428
rescales and rotates it.
 

00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:15.668
So in the complex plane,
it's very easy to attach the

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:22.509
phi, and at the end of the day,
you take the real part.

00:13:22.509 --> 00:13:25.389
So you can imagine doing any
realistic problem.

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:31.168
Suppose I tell you R is
10 ohms, where ω is

00:13:31.168 --> 00:13:33.220
some 100Π.
 

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:39.330
L is 3 henries and the
capacitance is 2 microfarads,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:45.418
you can find Z. Z
for this circuit will be 100--

00:13:45.418 --> 00:13:49.450
I'm sorry Z will be 10
ωL,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:54.279
will be 100Π
times 3 henries −

00:13:54.279 --> 00:14:01.370
1/ωC,
is 100Π times

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.870
2�10^(-6).
 

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.269
That's some complex number.
 

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:08.970
I forgot the i here.
 

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:09.980
That is a complex number.
 

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.259
I don't want to calculate it.
 

00:14:12.259 --> 00:14:13.940
It's whatever it is.
 

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.051
Then it's got a real part which
is 10, an imaginary part,

00:14:17.051 --> 00:14:19.440
which is this algebraic sum of
these two.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:22.765
You can actually plot the real
values you get here in this

00:14:22.765 --> 00:14:23.350
problem.
 

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.110
I'm just going to show you the
10.

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:29.259
The other guy's whatever it is,
and you can get the phase.

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:30.580
That tells you that in this
problem,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.774
the current will have an
amplitude which is the volts you

00:14:34.774 --> 00:14:38.376
apply,
maybe you applied 100 volts,

00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:43.710
and you divide by this absolute
value of Z.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.678
So if you want,
I'll complete the last part.

00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:50.558
The absolute value of Z,
like for any complex number,

00:14:50.558 --> 00:14:56.320
is R^(2) ωL - 1
over ωC squared,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.610
right?
 

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:01.798
Any complex number,
the absolute value is real

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:05.428
squared imaginary squared under
root.

00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:08.590
So let's write in all its glory
the current that we want.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:12.485
I(t) is
V_0/R^(2)

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:18.005
ωL - 1 over
ωC squared cosine

00:15:18.005 --> 00:15:22.119
of ωt -
Φ where

00:15:22.119 --> 00:15:28.504
tanΦ = ωL
− 1/ωC divided

00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:30.668
by R.
 

00:15:30.668 --> 00:15:33.490
Here is the picture,
here's R.

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.309
ωL minus
1/ωC.

00:15:36.309 --> 00:15:37.139
There's Φ.
 

00:15:37.139 --> 00:15:46.519
There's a complex number
Z. Okay.

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:48.803
So you can imagine now putting
numbers and getting what you

00:15:48.803 --> 00:15:49.080
want.
 

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.759
Notice that the current lags
the applied voltage.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:56.125
For example,
if cosωt is a

00:15:56.125 --> 00:15:59.798
maximum of t = 0 and
Φ was 45 degrees,

00:15:59.798 --> 00:16:02.466
you'll have to wait till
ωt is 45 degrees

00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:04.480
before the current reaches a
maximum,

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.269
so it will be lagging the
voltage.

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:08.740
But sometimes Φ
can come out negative.

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:17.379
Can you see how Φ
could come out negative?

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:20.605
This angle Φ need
not be positive,

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.440
do you understand that?
 

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:27.178
What would make it negative?
 

00:16:27.178 --> 00:16:32.841
Look at the formula there,
ωL −

00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:34.980
1/ωC.
 

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.070
Yes?
 

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.471
Student:  If
1/ωC is bigger than

00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:39.320
ωL.
 

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.038
Prof: Right.
 

00:16:40.038 --> 00:16:42.635
If 1 over ωC is
bigger than ωL,

00:16:42.635 --> 00:16:44.629
this will be more negative than
positive.

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.490
The complex number may end up
like that.

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.779
So I've written it for one
possible sign.

00:16:50.779 --> 00:16:52.706
If that flips sign,
the Φ itself will

00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:53.279
change sign.
 

00:16:53.279 --> 00:16:55.600
It will become ωt
32 degrees.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.090
It can go either way.
 

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.048
It depends on who is dominating
it, whether the inductor or the

00:17:01.048 --> 00:17:02.899
capacitor is dominating it.
 

00:17:02.899 --> 00:17:08.190
So let's look at the answer for
one other interesting feature.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:10.480
I want you to know two things.
 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.101
This trick works only if the
voltage is a pure oscillatory

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:17.940
function like
cosωt.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.973
But then you can write it as a
real part of

00:17:19.973 --> 00:17:21.670
e^(iωt) and do
this.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.019
Secondly, the impedance is not
a constant.

00:17:25.019 --> 00:17:29.161
Whereas the resistance is just
10 ohms, impedance varies with

00:17:29.161 --> 00:17:29.990
frequency.
 

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.682
It's a frequency dependent
number that you divide the

00:17:34.682 --> 00:17:37.568
voltage by to get the current.
 

00:17:37.568 --> 00:17:39.759
So the consequence of this is
the following.

00:17:39.759 --> 00:17:43.954
Suppose you plot here the
magnitude of the current,

00:17:43.954 --> 00:17:47.058
let's call it
I_0.

00:17:47.058 --> 00:17:48.741
This whole thing,
let me call it

00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:49.990
I_0.
 

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.684
That's the amplitude of the
current, as a function of

00:17:53.684 --> 00:17:58.019
frequency for a given applied
voltage V_0.

00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:01.275
So V_0 is
fixed, but when ω

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:03.778
varies, these numbers are
varying.

00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:09.627
When ω goes to 0,
you've got a 1 over 0 in the

00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:11.039
denominator.
 

00:18:11.039 --> 00:18:12.980
That's going to beat everything.
 

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.737
And 1 over 0 squared in the
denominator means the whole

00:18:16.737 --> 00:18:17.920
thing vanishes.
 

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:21.288
The current starts out as 0.
 

00:18:21.288 --> 00:18:24.977
That corresponds to the fact
that if your voltage had been a

00:18:24.977 --> 00:18:27.288
DC source instead of an AC
source--

00:18:27.288 --> 00:18:29.480
that's what ω = 0
means--

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.820
the capacitor will charge to
some point and then stop the

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.240
current.
 

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.430
That's it.
 

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.492
Then it will go up,
then come down,

00:18:36.492 --> 00:18:38.678
because at very large
ω,

00:18:38.678 --> 00:18:41.410
the ωL is going to
dominate.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:43.750
You get 1 over ωL
squared under root,

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.470
that looks like
1/ωL.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.051
It will fall like
1/ω at very large

00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.118
frequencies.
 

00:18:50.118 --> 00:18:56.730
And it will be the maximum when
these two guys cancel each

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:57.660
other.
 

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.160
So you've got R^(2).
 

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.586
If you're trying to get the
maximum current,

00:19:00.586 --> 00:19:02.180
there's nothing you can do
about R^(2).

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.078
It is what it is.
 

00:19:04.078 --> 00:19:08.561
But you can play these two guys
against each other and find a

00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:12.221
frequency ω
and R so that this

00:19:12.221 --> 00:19:15.584
is true and that
ω_0 is

00:19:15.584 --> 00:19:20.588
just related to the resonant
frequency of the LC combination.

00:19:20.588 --> 00:19:25.549
So at that frequency,
the current amplitude will be

00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:30.611
simply--I_0
maximum, will be simply

00:19:30.611 --> 00:19:33.288
V_0/R.
 

00:19:33.288 --> 00:19:35.838
It's as if L and
C are not there.

00:19:35.838 --> 00:19:38.089
You've got them there but
they're not there.

00:19:38.089 --> 00:19:38.980
They're not doing anything.
 

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.420
They neutralize each other.
 

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.000
So you can ask,
why put something in that

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.868
doesn't do anything?
 

00:19:44.868 --> 00:19:46.471
Well, first of all,
it does something on other

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:46.970
frequencies.
 

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.828
Only at one magical frequency,
they go away.

00:19:50.828 --> 00:19:57.500
But what is interesting is the
very sharp response you have.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.630
So do you know where that comes
into play?

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.788
Student:  Resonance?
 

00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:08.105
Prof: Resonance,
yeah, but which part of your

00:20:08.105 --> 00:20:08.559
life?
 

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:09.289
Pardon me?
 

00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:10.009
Student:  Radio.
 

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:10.990
Prof: Radio.
 

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:13.068
You guys know what that is,
because I don't.

00:20:13.068 --> 00:20:15.380
You're always carrying some
recorded medium.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.929
But if you listen to radio,
like in the old days,

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:22.109
you have this room full of
radio signals.

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:24.230
Everyone wants your attention.
 

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.247
All the radio stations are all
sending signals right now in

00:20:28.247 --> 00:20:32.750
this room, and you want to pick
just one station that you like.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.217
So what happens if that station
sends that information at a

00:20:36.217 --> 00:20:38.430
certain
ω_0?

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.630
And if that's all you want,
you go to the store,

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.248
buy an LCR circuit,
with L and C

00:20:43.248 --> 00:20:46.214
chosen so that LC is
1/ω_0

00:20:46.214 --> 00:20:48.880
^(2),
then you will get a huge

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.890
response when you get the signal
from that station.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.048
Now there's another station
with a different frequency.

00:20:56.048 --> 00:20:58.977
You don't want to listen to
them, but you have to listen to

00:20:58.977 --> 00:21:01.096
some of them,
because if their frequency is

00:21:01.096 --> 00:21:03.568
here, your response to that
station is not 0.

00:21:03.568 --> 00:21:06.471
It's a lot smaller than this,
but it's not 0,

00:21:06.471 --> 00:21:10.099
and there may be yet another
station you can hear in the

00:21:10.099 --> 00:21:11.088
background.
 

00:21:11.088 --> 00:21:13.661
If you don't want to hear them,
you would like to get 0 signal

00:21:13.661 --> 00:21:15.685
from them,
but you cannot kill this

00:21:15.685 --> 00:21:17.839
function except at one
frequency,

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:20.298
but you can make it very sharp.
 

00:21:20.298 --> 00:21:22.829
If R is very,
very small, this function will

00:21:22.829 --> 00:21:25.510
be very large at resonance,
because V_0/R

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.028
will be a huge number.
 

00:21:27.028 --> 00:21:30.605
It will also be very narrow,
so you can make this thing very

00:21:30.605 --> 00:21:31.088
sharp.
 

00:21:31.088 --> 00:21:36.405
And that's really controlled by
the ratio of R to

00:21:36.405 --> 00:21:37.470
L.
 

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.733
So other stations do give you
weak signal, but you can make

00:21:41.733 --> 00:21:45.557
them weaker and weaker by
picking a very finely tuned

00:21:45.557 --> 00:21:46.660
oscillator.
 

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:52.115
Now the question is,
what if you changed your mind

00:21:52.115 --> 00:21:56.460
and you want to listen to these
guys?

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.720
What should you do?
 

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.230
Can you go and buy one radio
for this station,

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:05.848
one radio for that station?
 

00:22:05.848 --> 00:22:07.808
You know you do something,
right?

00:22:07.808 --> 00:22:13.049
You fiddle with the dial,
but what do you think it does?

00:22:13.049 --> 00:22:13.640
Yes?
 

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.759
Student:  Changes the
capacitance.

00:22:14.759 --> 00:22:16.420
Prof: Changes the
capacitance.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.541
It's not easy to change the
inductance, but it changes the

00:22:19.541 --> 00:22:20.308
capacitance.
 

00:22:20.308 --> 00:22:25.230
Nowadays if you open a radio,
I don't know what you will see.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:27.960
It's all glued on to something.
 

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.680
But in the old days,
when all the parts were big,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.112
you can open the radio and look
inside and you have a capacitor

00:22:35.112 --> 00:22:37.900
which is called a variable
capacitor.

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.890
You show that with an arrow.
 

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.846
You can also have variable
inductors, I suppose,

00:22:41.846 --> 00:22:42.930
but this is very common.
 

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:44.910
Now how do you vary the
capacitance?

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.924
Capacitance you know is
ε_0

00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:49.779
A/d.
 

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:50.519
Yes?
 

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:52.009
Student:  Can you change
the surface area?

00:22:52.009 --> 00:22:53.510
Prof: You can change the
surface area,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:55.490
but how do you think you can go
change the surface area?

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:57.759
Student:  Having two
half circles and then the

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:58.849
current rotates around.
 

00:22:58.849 --> 00:22:59.308
Prof: That's right.
 

00:22:59.308 --> 00:23:03.015
You've got these interlocking
plates and you can have them

00:23:03.015 --> 00:23:05.420
fully overlapped or not
overlapped.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:10.660
If you draw the plates like
this, it's got many things.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.159
And these plates can be either
really overlapping with the

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.940
other plates or pulled out.
 

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.824
When you turn the dial,
the two things move in and out,

00:23:18.824 --> 00:23:20.640
and that varies the
capacitance.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.613
That will give you a range of
frequencies and that's the range

00:23:24.613 --> 00:23:25.589
you can hear.
 

00:23:25.589 --> 00:23:27.088
That's one thing.
 

00:23:27.088 --> 00:23:29.259
Another thing I want to mention
is,

00:23:29.259 --> 00:23:33.114
this solution I wrote down,
I(t) is

00:23:33.114 --> 00:23:38.846
V_0 over mod
Z cos(ωt −

00:23:38.846 --> 00:23:44.298
Φ) has no
free parameters in it.

00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:47.048
You tell me the time,
I tell you the current.

00:23:47.048 --> 00:23:49.364
Whatever the voltage is,
you take that,

00:23:49.364 --> 00:23:53.078
shift the phase by Φ
and divide by mod Z.

00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:58.329
But you know that a second
order equation in time must have

00:23:58.329 --> 00:24:02.221
two free parameters,
so where are those free

00:24:02.221 --> 00:24:05.298
parameters going to come from?
 

00:24:05.298 --> 00:24:09.599
Have you seen this before in
your math whatever?

00:24:09.599 --> 00:24:12.880
No?
 

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.709
Okay, I'm going to give you a
clue and you have to think about

00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:23.009
this clue and see what you get
out of that.

00:24:23.009 --> 00:24:26.467
V_0
cosωt =

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:30.269
V_0
cosωt 0.

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:35.470
That's your clue.
 

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:44.769
What can you do with that clue?
 

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:45.788
Yes?
 

00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:48.588
Student:  Set the
original equation equal to 0 to

00:24:48.588 --> 00:24:50.318
find the complementary solution.
 

00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:53.180
Prof: Yes,
so I will translate.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.460
If you have a problem where you
apply one voltage,

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.174
V_1 and you
get a current

00:24:58.174 --> 00:24:59.912
I_1,
and a second voltage

00:24:59.912 --> 00:25:02.328
V_2 and you get
a current I_2,

00:25:02.328 --> 00:25:04.473
just by adding the two
equations, left hand side to

00:25:04.473 --> 00:25:06.920
left hand side and right hand
side to right hand side,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.613
you can check that
V_1

00:25:08.613 --> 00:25:11.104
V_2 drives a
current I_1

00:25:11.104 --> 00:25:12.200
I_2.
 

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.690
If you don't see that,
you should do that.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.028
Take that equation,
but any V of t,

00:25:17.028 --> 00:25:19.210
get an answer due to
V_1,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:20.352
call it I_1,
another due to

00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:22.519
V_2,
call it I_2

00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:23.450
and add them up.
 

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:25.104
Left hand side is clearly
V_1

00:25:25.104 --> 00:25:26.920
V_2 and the right
hand side,

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.095
R times I_1
R times I_2

00:25:29.095 --> 00:25:30.233
is R times
I_1

00:25:30.233 --> 00:25:31.338
I_2 and so on.
 

00:25:31.338 --> 00:25:33.695
So I_1
I_2 will satisfy

00:25:33.695 --> 00:25:36.483
the equation when the driving
voltage is the sum of the two

00:25:36.483 --> 00:25:37.108
voltages.
 

00:25:37.108 --> 00:25:40.230
It all comes because there's
nothing nonlinear.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.032
For example,
for the right hand side at

00:25:43.032 --> 00:25:46.319
R times I^(2),
then the first equation will

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:48.000
have R times
I_1^(2),

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.088
second will have R times
I_2^(2).

00:25:50.088 --> 00:25:51.965
When you add them,
you'll get R times

00:25:51.965 --> 00:25:54.279
I_1^(2)
I_2^(2),

00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:56.019
but what you want is really
R times I_1

00:25:56.019 --> 00:25:58.779
I_2,
the whole thing squared.

00:25:58.779 --> 00:26:01.339
So if you have nonlinear terms,
you cannot add solutions,

00:26:01.339 --> 00:26:03.809
but if you have linear terms,
you can add solutions.

00:26:03.809 --> 00:26:05.308
Therefore 0 is a hint.
 

00:26:05.308 --> 00:26:08.308
It says, add the solution for 0
voltage.

00:26:08.308 --> 00:26:11.111
You might say,
"There is no solution for

00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:13.977
0 voltage,"
but I will have to remind you

00:26:13.977 --> 00:26:17.797
that we did solve the problem
the other day of an LCR circuit

00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:22.000
connected to nothing that had a
current flowing for a while.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.338
But it won't do it if it's
completely inert.

00:26:24.338 --> 00:26:27.009
But if you have put some charge
on this guy to begin with,

00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:29.680
then you saw that the current
and the charge,

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:33.288
everything starts and
oscillates exponentially like

00:26:33.288 --> 00:26:36.752
e to the - some number
t times some

00:26:36.752 --> 00:26:39.930
cosω't - some other
phase,

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.990
call it χ.
 

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:44.759
And this thing had two free
parameters.

00:26:44.759 --> 00:26:48.509
There's an area here and a
χ here.

00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:51.431
Or you can write it as
e^(-)^(γ)

00:26:51.431 --> 00:26:54.849
^(t) times
Acosω't

00:26:54.849 --> 00:26:56.838
Bsinω't.
 

00:26:56.838 --> 00:26:59.088
No matter how we write it,
this function,

00:26:59.088 --> 00:27:01.881
this solution to 0 external
voltage is called a

00:27:01.881 --> 00:27:05.413
complementary solution,
and the final solution for

00:27:05.413 --> 00:27:09.286
I is really what I wrote,
V over mod Z

00:27:09.286 --> 00:27:12.160
cos(ωt −
Φ),

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:17.598
this complementary function.
 

00:27:17.598 --> 00:27:21.067
Because if you take this
complementary function and add

00:27:21.067 --> 00:27:23.442
it to the equation,
you might think it will mess up

00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:24.669
the equation,
but it won't,

00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:27.182
because the I that I wrote down
will give me

00:27:27.182 --> 00:27:28.818
V_0cosωt.
 

00:27:28.818 --> 00:27:31.336
The complementary function,
when you take RI

00:27:31.336 --> 00:27:34.660
LdI/dt  1 over C I dt
for the complementary part,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.534
you will get 0,
because the complementary guy

00:27:38.534 --> 00:27:43.376
obeys the following equation:
it obeys the equation L

00:27:43.376 --> 00:27:48.661
dI/dt R times IC 1
over C integral IC dt

00:27:48.661 --> 00:27:51.935
is 0,
is the equation satisfied in

00:27:51.935 --> 00:27:52.670
that loop.
 

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.126
If it has a non-zero solution,
you can add it to your

00:27:57.126 --> 00:27:58.068
equation.
 

00:27:58.068 --> 00:28:01.351
See, in elementary calculus,
you learn that if you solve an

00:28:01.351 --> 00:28:03.680
equation,
say dF/dx =

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.606
x_2,
the answer is

00:28:06.606 --> 00:28:08.996
x_2/2
[x^(3)/3]

00:28:08.996 --> 00:28:10.772
a constant,
because when you add a

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.440
constant, you don't screw up the
solution,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:17.038
because the d/dx kills the
constant.

00:28:17.038 --> 00:28:19.012
Question is,
what can you add to this

00:28:19.012 --> 00:28:20.328
differential equation?
 

00:28:20.328 --> 00:28:22.554
You can add anything,
any function,

00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:25.890
that's annihilated by that
differential equation.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:28.486
If you put the function in,
you get 0 from all the

00:28:28.486 --> 00:28:31.558
derivatives and integrals,
you can add that to anything.

00:28:31.558 --> 00:28:35.630
Therefore the true answer is
this complementary function.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.195
It will contain these two
parameters A and B and you pick

00:28:39.195 --> 00:28:41.680
them depending on initial
conditions.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.380
In other words,
if you took an LCR circuit and

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.838
took a generator and you hooked
it up,

00:28:46.838 --> 00:28:51.150
from the instant you hooked it
up, it won't immediately assume

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.163
this form that I have here,
because for example,

00:28:54.163 --> 00:28:56.830
at t = 0,
maybe the current is 0 in the

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.730
real problem.
 

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:01.090
This current doesn't vanish,
but you should add to this,

00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.068
this function.
 

00:29:02.068 --> 00:29:06.078
Choose A and B so that the
current vanishes at the = 0.

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:09.625
You can fit the actual
experiment to the solution by

00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:13.517
choosing A and B to match the
initial current and say the

00:29:13.517 --> 00:29:16.019
initial charge in the capacitor.
 

00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:18.440
But we don't usually care about
this guy.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.980
Do you know why we don't talk
about this too much?

00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:23.529
Yes?
 

00:29:23.529 --> 00:29:25.038
Student:  It dies off.
 

00:29:25.038 --> 00:29:26.721
Prof: It dies off
exponentially,

00:29:26.721 --> 00:29:28.358
so in real life,
it doesn't matter.

00:29:28.358 --> 00:29:30.182
If you really want to know
what's happening,

00:29:30.182 --> 00:29:31.666
in other words,
take an LCR circuit,

00:29:31.666 --> 00:29:32.598
take an AC source.
 

00:29:32.598 --> 00:29:35.710
Put a switch,
keep the switch open.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.108
The minute you close it,
the current will be 0 by

00:29:38.108 --> 00:29:38.759
continuity.
 

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:40.568
Current cannot jump.
 

00:29:40.568 --> 00:29:43.308
So this function obviously is
not the whole answer.

00:29:43.308 --> 00:29:45.788
It doesn't vanish at t =
0.

00:29:45.788 --> 00:29:49.571
But this extra part you add in
with suitably chosen A and B

00:29:49.571 --> 00:29:51.920
will fit those initial
conditions.

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.696
But after oscillating for a
while, e to the -

00:29:54.696 --> 00:29:57.910
something t for a long
t will just go away.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.548
Then it will settle down only
to this function.

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:04.154
This is called a steady state
current and this is called a

00:30:04.154 --> 00:30:05.420
transient current.
 

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:07.670
So transients are important;
you cannot ignore them.

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.113
Maybe a transient will burn
your circuit,

00:30:10.113 --> 00:30:12.680
but it doesn't matter after a
long time.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.311
If you survive the early time,
it doesn't matter for the long

00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:15.619
time.
 

00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:18.180
It's a lot like this course.
 

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:23.166
Okay, all right,
so I want to take a minute to

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:30.259
tell you a little more about the
use of these complex numbers.

00:30:30.259 --> 00:30:32.098
I do it for a lot of reasons.
 

00:30:32.098 --> 00:30:34.059
Now I don't know what field you
guys are in.

00:30:34.059 --> 00:30:35.700
You could be in art history.
 

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.176
You just don't know when
complex numbers are going to be

00:30:39.176 --> 00:30:42.150
relevant to what you do,
you just don't know.

00:30:42.150 --> 00:30:44.140
But I'm serious,
if you're doing engineering,

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.029
electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering,

00:30:46.029 --> 00:30:48.851
it's all about complex numbers,
because everybody writes a

00:30:48.851 --> 00:30:50.038
differential equation.
 

00:30:50.038 --> 00:30:53.172
If it's a linear differential
equation, you solve it with

00:30:53.172 --> 00:30:54.180
complex numbers.
 

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.157
And I like to also show you why
sometimes we should not resist

00:30:58.157 --> 00:31:02.030
the mathematics so much,
because you might think in this

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.618
circuit I don't need complex
numbers.

00:31:04.618 --> 00:31:06.636
After all, in the end,
the answer was a

00:31:06.636 --> 00:31:09.397
cos(ωt −
Φ) and that is

00:31:09.397 --> 00:31:12.000
cos times some number sine times
some number.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.133
I can put the combination and
fiddle with it till it works,

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:15.890
that's true.
 

00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:18.910
But suppose I gave you a more
complicated circuit.

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:20.838
Here's a more complicated
circuit.

00:31:20.838 --> 00:31:26.660
I have maybe a resistor,
an inductor.

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:29.498
Then I come here,
I have a capacitor,

00:31:29.498 --> 00:31:31.470
maybe another inductor.
 

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.048
Go like that,
let's call it R_1,

00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:36.727
L_1,
C_2,

00:31:36.727 --> 00:31:41.508
L_3 and this is
some V_0

00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:44.088
cosωt.
 

00:31:44.088 --> 00:31:46.410
How are you going to solve this
problem by guessing?

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.650
You have no idea how to guess.
 

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:52.769
You cannot solve this problem
by guesswork.

00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:57.788
But I claim that if you replace
this fellow by V_0

00:31:57.788 --> 00:32:00.855
e^(iωt),
you'll be able to guess the

00:32:00.855 --> 00:32:02.592
answer,
you'll be able to solve the

00:32:02.592 --> 00:32:03.019
problem.
 

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:08.250
So I want to take a minute to
tell you why that works.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.730
So do you know what I'm trying
to do now?

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.403
I'm trying to tell you that an
arbitrarily complex AC circuit

00:32:13.403 --> 00:32:16.384
built of resistors,
inductors, capacitors,

00:32:16.384 --> 00:32:20.190
connected any way you like,
add whatever you want,

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.640
if you go back to the
differential equation,

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.873
it will drive you insane,
because there is a derivative

00:32:25.873 --> 00:32:27.845
of this current,
derivative of that current,

00:32:27.845 --> 00:32:30.289
integral of that current,
all coupled in some way.

00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:32.759
How are you going to solve it?
 

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:35.579
You cannot guess anything
cosine and anything sine.

00:32:35.579 --> 00:32:37.519
It's going to be a madness.
 

00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:40.578
But I will show you that if you
use complex numbers,

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:44.118
you can reduce the problem to
something that looks like a DC

00:32:44.118 --> 00:32:44.839
circuit.
 

00:32:44.839 --> 00:32:46.838
That's all I want to do.
 

00:32:46.838 --> 00:32:50.503
So I'm going to give you the
idea, but I don't want to do the

00:32:50.503 --> 00:32:54.047
whole thing, because I don't
want to spend too much time on

00:32:54.047 --> 00:32:54.779
algebra.
 

00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:57.353
For those of you who want to
know where it comes from,

00:32:57.353 --> 00:32:58.808
I want to give you a chance.
 

00:32:58.808 --> 00:33:01.484
Those of you who don't want to
know exactly where everything

00:33:01.484 --> 00:33:03.517
comes from,
in the end, I will give you the

00:33:03.517 --> 00:33:05.853
so called bottom line,
stuff you must know,

00:33:05.853 --> 00:33:07.670
then you'll forget all this.
 

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:10.210
So let's take that problem.
 

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:15.396
Let me take an easier one that
this one, because it's got too

00:33:15.396 --> 00:33:17.298
many wrinkles in it.
 

00:33:17.298 --> 00:33:23.933
But the point I'm making,
I can illustrate just as easily

00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:25.829
with this guy.
 

00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:26.740
So what did I call it?
 

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.046
R_1,
L_1,

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:31.650
C_2,
L_3.

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:34.118
Let the current here be
I_1.

00:33:34.118 --> 00:33:36.574
Let the current here be
I_2,

00:33:36.574 --> 00:33:38.750
current here is
I_3.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:44.568
And this is V_0
cosωt.

00:33:44.568 --> 00:33:47.615
Our job is to find those
currents if they're all

00:33:47.615 --> 00:33:51.440
oscillatory functions of time,
in magnitude and in phase.

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.390
If you do that, you're done.
 

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:55.250
So how do we do it normally?
 

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.348
What are the fundamental
equations for a circuit?

00:33:58.348 --> 00:34:02.058
The fundamental equations are
that at every branch,

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:05.730
the incoming current should be
equal to the outgoing current,

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:12.043
which for us means
I_1 = I_2

00:34:12.043 --> 00:34:14.570
I_3.
 

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.202
So I_2 and
I_3 come down

00:34:16.202 --> 00:34:17.920
here and they join and become
I_1 again,

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.550
so I'm going to assume that and
write I_1

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.920
there.
 

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.012
So I've got two unknown
currents, I_2

00:34:23.012 --> 00:34:24.079
and I_3.
 

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:26.514
That's the first thing to
understand, how many free,

00:34:26.514 --> 00:34:28.090
independent currents there are.
 

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:30.036
Generally, if it's a simple
problem, it's equal to the

00:34:30.036 --> 00:34:31.030
number of loops you have.
 

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:34.039
That's a loop here,
that's a loop there.

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:37.744
You can draw many other loops,
like that one and that one,

00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:40.670
but they will not give you any
new results.

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.144
So you've got to write voltage
equations that say if you go

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:46.481
around a loop,
and you come to where you

00:34:46.481 --> 00:34:48.099
start, the change is 0.
 

00:34:48.099 --> 00:34:53.588
The equation I would write
would be V_0

00:34:53.588 --> 00:34:59.293
cosωt = (I'm
going to take this loop)

00:34:59.293 --> 00:35:03.599
R_1
I_1

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:08.335
L_1
dI_1/dt 1 over

00:35:08.335 --> 00:35:13.393
C integral
I_2 dt'. Back

00:35:13.393 --> 00:35:15.869
to here is 0.
 

00:35:15.869 --> 00:35:20.889
That's one equation.
 

00:35:20.889 --> 00:35:24.065
For the second loop,
I can go around the other way

00:35:24.065 --> 00:35:27.891
if you like, going round this
inductor, or I can take a loop

00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:28.800
like this.
 

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.518
I just want to write that to
show you what it may look like.

00:35:32.518 --> 00:35:36.199
That equation will say
L_3

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:41.911
dI_3/dt - 1 over
C_2 integral

00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.010
I_2 dt = 0.
 

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.746
The - sign comes because if the
current is assumed to flow this

00:35:48.746 --> 00:35:50.835
way,
and your loop goes counter to

00:35:50.835 --> 00:35:52.527
the current,
you're going uphill,

00:35:52.527 --> 00:35:54.170
so everything should be
subtracted,

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.922
but if you go down,
you can write it going down

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:58.820
this way.
 

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.829
So these are the three
equations to solve.

00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:05.217
They're complicated because
there are differentials,

00:36:05.217 --> 00:36:07.210
integrals and you know what.
 

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:12.753
But if I solve the following
problem: V_0

00:36:12.753 --> 00:36:16.842
e^(iωt)--
so don't bother to write all of

00:36:16.842 --> 00:36:18.527
this,
because you're not responsible

00:36:18.527 --> 00:36:19.239
for this detail.
 

00:36:19.239 --> 00:36:21.440
I just want you to know what's
going on.

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:25.039
So I scrap this problem and I
solve this problem,

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:28.715
and the current for that I take
to be the twiddle,

00:36:28.715 --> 00:36:29.389
okay?
 

00:36:29.389 --> 00:36:31.791
I say, let the
I˜'s be the answer

00:36:31.791 --> 00:36:34.139
to this problem with
e^(iωt).

00:36:34.139 --> 00:36:40.132
Can you see that if I took the
real part of the first equation,

00:36:40.132 --> 00:36:45.449
I get the correct equation for
the physical currents;

00:36:45.449 --> 00:36:47.639
that if I took the real part of
the second equation,

00:36:47.639 --> 00:36:49.793
everywhere I replace
I˜ by the real part

00:36:49.793 --> 00:36:51.605
which I call I,
and this becomes

00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:53.639
V_0
cosωt,

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:56.518
I get a second voltage equation.
 

00:36:56.518 --> 00:36:59.393
And here again you drop the
twiddles by taking the real

00:36:59.393 --> 00:37:01.041
part,
that's the equation satisfied

00:37:01.041 --> 00:37:03.327
by the physical currents,
I_2 and

00:37:03.327 --> 00:37:04.380
I_3.
 

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.731
So it is still true,
even in this complicated

00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:08.731
problem,
that once you've solved it,

00:37:08.731 --> 00:37:11.764
you may take the real part of
the voltage and take the real

00:37:11.764 --> 00:37:15.081
part of the current anywhere,
that's the answer to the

00:37:15.081 --> 00:37:16.409
primordial problem.
 

00:37:16.409 --> 00:37:19.239
So why does this make life easy
for you?

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:21.409
Because now you may take the
current.

00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:24.170
I'll just take one of these as
an example.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.429
Let the current be current
I˜_1,

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:33.829
let it be I˜_1,0
e^(iωt),

00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:37.797
and I˜_2 =
I˜_2,0

00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:42.483
e^(iωt),
and I˜_3

00:37:42.483 --> 00:37:46.050
is I˜_3,0
e^(iωt).

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.420
Make that guess,
and what does this mean?

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:49.929
Think about it?
 

00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:52.889
Go to the first equation.
 

00:37:52.889 --> 00:37:57.327
Equate these twiddle guys and
all the e^(iωt)'s

00:37:57.327 --> 00:38:01.909
cancel on all the three terms,
so you get an equation that

00:38:01.909 --> 00:38:06.106
says I˜_1,0 =
I˜_2,0

00:38:06.106 --> 00:38:08.440
I˜_3,0.
 

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.639
No time dependence anywhere.
 

00:38:10.639 --> 00:38:14.829
It looks like a DC equation.
 

00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:18.018
And let's go to this equation
here.

00:38:18.018 --> 00:38:21.969
You will find V_0
= R times

00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:26.608
I˜_1_
 iωL_1

00:38:26.608 --> 00:38:31.590
I˜_1
1/iωC (I should

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.766
have called this
C_2)

00:38:34.766 --> 00:38:37.516
ωC_2
times

00:38:37.516 --> 00:38:40.780
I˜_2.
 

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:45.469
e^(iωt)'s have
been canceled everywhere.

00:38:45.469 --> 00:38:46.710
So what do you find?
 

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:53.465
This again looks like an Ohm's
law problem where R_1

00:38:53.465 --> 00:38:57.965
is the impedance of this guy,
iωL_1 is

00:38:57.965 --> 00:39:00.472
the impedance of that guy,
so the whole thing looks like

00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:03.755
some Z_1 times
I˜_1

00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:07.039
Z_2 times
I˜_2.

00:39:07.039 --> 00:39:12.047
In other words,
let me just write it below this

00:39:12.047 --> 00:39:12.809
here.
 

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:15.675
The equation we get is,
V_0 =

00:39:15.675 --> 00:39:19.052
Z_1 times
I˜_1

00:39:19.052 --> 00:39:22.809
Z_2 times
I˜_2.

00:39:22.809 --> 00:39:26.650
So the problem will look like
this: just put some black box

00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.418
here,
Z_1,

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:30.802
another black box,
Z_2,

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:33.585
another black box,
Z_3,

00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:35.690
join them, bring them out.
 

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.539
Call the current here as
I˜_1,0,

00:39:38.539 --> 00:39:41.190
the current here is
I˜_2,0,

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:44.650
the current here is
I˜_3,0.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.371
And these constant numbers,
they have no time dependence,

00:39:49.371 --> 00:39:54.347
obey the same equations as the
real currents did in the real

00:39:54.347 --> 00:39:55.360
problem.
 

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.039
So it's like a DC problem.
 

00:39:57.039 --> 00:40:01.103
The only subtlety is,
the impedances are complex,

00:40:01.103 --> 00:40:04.829
and the rule for impedance is
very simple.

00:40:04.829 --> 00:40:09.246
If you open the box and you
find a resistor an inductor,

00:40:09.246 --> 00:40:12.539
the impedance for that is
R_1

00:40:12.539 --> 00:40:14.949
iωL_1.
 

00:40:14.949 --> 00:40:15.690
That's it.
 

00:40:15.690 --> 00:40:21.550
Apart from that variation,
it is just like DC circuits.

00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:23.920
Yes?
 

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.920
Student:  Is there any
physical significance to the

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.079
imaginary part of the solution?
 

00:40:27.079 --> 00:40:28.230
Prof: No.
 

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.929
If you want,
the imaginary part of the

00:40:30.929 --> 00:40:34.650
solution is the answer to a
person whose voltage was

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.860
V_0
sinωt.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.715
So you are solving two
problems, but we believe that

00:40:40.715 --> 00:40:41.780
it's nothing new.
 

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.259
If you can do
cosωt,

00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:45.293
the answer to
sinωt is the same,

00:40:45.293 --> 00:40:47.050
except you shift by
Π/2.

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:48.039
Everything looks the same.
 

00:40:48.039 --> 00:40:51.820
But it answers that question.
 

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.980
Okay, so this is what I want
you to know.

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:58.018
Given an AC circuit,
here's what you do.

00:40:58.018 --> 00:41:01.547
You make this rule:
whenever you see this guy,

00:41:01.547 --> 00:41:02.880
it is R.
 

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.436
Whenever you see this guy,
it is iωL and

00:41:07.436 --> 00:41:12.079
whenever you see this guy,
it's 1/iωC.

00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:15.927
Then you can combine impedances
in series by adding them,

00:41:15.927 --> 00:41:19.706
or in parallel by doing the
reciprocals and adding them,

00:41:19.706 --> 00:41:22.179
then taking the inverse of
that.

00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:24.230
It's all like DC circuits.
 

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.809
What will you have at the end?
 

00:41:25.809 --> 00:41:28.909
At the end, you will have found
out every current

00:41:28.909 --> 00:41:31.429
I˜_
0,α.

00:41:31.429 --> 00:41:36.530
α is 1,2 or 3 in
this problem.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:40.039
You solve these DC like
equations and you will find

00:41:40.039 --> 00:41:43.480
these DC like currents,
but they'll be complex.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:46.226
What is the relation of this
guy to the actual current

00:41:46.226 --> 00:41:48.559
flowing through the actual
circuit element?

00:41:48.559 --> 00:41:51.905
The answer is
I_α(t)

00:41:51.905 --> 00:41:55.648
will be I˜_
α times

00:41:55.648 --> 00:42:02.650
e^(iωt),
then take the real part.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:06.039
That's the algorithm.
 

00:42:06.039 --> 00:42:08.164
That's the relation between
these time independent

00:42:08.164 --> 00:42:09.768
functions, because what did you
do?

00:42:09.768 --> 00:42:11.539
You stripped their time
dependence.

00:42:11.539 --> 00:42:13.853
You wrote every current as
e^(iωt) times a

00:42:13.853 --> 00:42:15.440
number that doesn't depend on
time.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.449
It's those numbers that we have
solved for.

00:42:17.449 --> 00:42:19.518
But to go back to the original
current,

00:42:19.518 --> 00:42:22.268
first you've got to reinstate
the exponential you canceled

00:42:22.268 --> 00:42:25.211
everywhere and remember to take
the real part because that was

00:42:25.211 --> 00:42:25.840
the deal.
 

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.619
It's called the real deal,
real deal.

00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:30.769
You take the real part of your
answer.

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:32.980
How about following?
 

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:34.659
You've solved a very
complicated circuit.

00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:36.139
I don't even know what's going
on.

00:42:36.139 --> 00:42:37.389
Here's one guy.
 

00:42:37.389 --> 00:42:39.079
It's part of a big mess.
 

00:42:39.079 --> 00:42:42.210
Its impedance is Z.
 

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:45.391
There is a current,
I˜_0

00:42:45.391 --> 00:42:48.228
going through it,
meaning it's the complex

00:42:48.228 --> 00:42:49.750
amplitude of that.
 

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.443
If I ask you,
what is the actual voltage

00:42:52.443 --> 00:42:53.409
across this?
 

00:42:53.409 --> 00:42:57.460
If I put a volt meter here,
what will I measure?

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:59.509
Answer will be,
again,

00:42:59.509 --> 00:43:03.900
I˜_0
times Z.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:06.958
That's in the fake Ohm's law
calculation, but you've got to

00:43:06.958 --> 00:43:10.280
remember that these all had time
dependence, which I removed.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.110
Then you've got to remember
that I should take the real part

00:43:14.110 --> 00:43:15.150
of the answer.
 

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:20.313
That will be the actual
instantaneous voltage across

00:43:20.313 --> 00:43:24.159
that circuit element at that
time t.

00:43:24.159 --> 00:43:26.153
But remember,
I˜_0

00:43:26.153 --> 00:43:27.550
could be a complex number.
 

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:30.119
The Z inside the box
could be a complex number.

00:43:30.119 --> 00:43:32.228
When you multiply them,
you've got lots of complex

00:43:32.228 --> 00:43:32.659
numbers.
 

00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:37.860
You add on to get this guy and
take the real part.

00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.000
I would recommend,
when you come to such problems,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.550
that every complex number like
Z,

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.565
you write as an absolute value
times e to the i times some

00:43:46.565 --> 00:43:47.130
phase.
 

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:49.920
That makes your life easier,
because then the whole thing

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.960
will be the absolute value of
this times the absolute value of

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:55.987
that,
times e^(iωt) the

00:43:55.987 --> 00:43:58.768
phase of this the phase of that.
 

00:43:58.768 --> 00:44:02.067
And the real part of it is the
cosine of ωt these

00:44:02.067 --> 00:44:02.769
two phases.
 

00:44:02.769 --> 00:44:04.079
You understand?
 

00:44:04.079 --> 00:44:08.112
So if you wrote it as mod times
e^(i)^(Φ)

00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.221
_1,
absolutely value of Z

00:44:11.221 --> 00:44:13.360
e^(i)^(Φ)
_2,

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.280
times e^(iωt),
what is the real part of this

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.150
crazy number?
 

00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:19.719
These are all real numbers?
 

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:22.639
You pull them out,
combine the exponentials,

00:44:22.639 --> 00:44:24.344
you'll get e^(iωt
i)^(Φ)

00:44:24.344 --> 00:44:25.969
_1 from
this one,

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:27.338
iΦ
_2 from

00:44:27.338 --> 00:44:27.679
that one.
 

00:44:27.679 --> 00:44:30.382
So the full current will be
cos(ωt Φ

00:44:30.382 --> 00:44:32.123
_1
Φ

00:44:32.123 --> 00:44:33.268
_2).
 

00:44:33.268 --> 00:44:37.911
So the answer will be mod
I_0 mod

00:44:37.911 --> 00:44:42.460
Z cos(ωt 
Φ

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:46.061
_1
Φ

00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:48.619
_2).
 

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:55.150
So I don't mind waiting to give
you some time to digest this.

00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:58.527
You should be able to at least
solve simple DC circuits with

00:44:58.527 --> 00:44:59.730
more than one loop.
 

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:03.166
If you've got only one loop,
just do what we did earlier,

00:45:03.166 --> 00:45:04.639
V over Z and all that.
 

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:07.293
But if you've got two loops,
you should learn how to handle

00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:09.170
that problem,
because it's very useful.

00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:13.269
You're going to deal with
circuits no matter what you do.

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:14.130
Yes?
 

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:17.556
Student:  In the initial
problem, if you were just trying

00:45:17.556 --> 00:45:19.951
to find the total current
through the system,

00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:21.420
impedances add,
like--

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:22.130
Prof: That's what I said.
 

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.920
That's correct.
 

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:24.440
So let us ask the following
question.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:26.740
His question was,
what if I'd like to know the

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:28.429
current coming out of this guy?
 

00:45:28.429 --> 00:45:29.469
Right?
 

00:45:29.469 --> 00:45:30.760
Everybody with me?
 

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.309
That was his question?
 

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:34.909
So we do it as if everything
were real.

00:45:34.909 --> 00:45:39.329
First we combine these two guys
into a single impedance,

00:45:39.329 --> 00:45:41.969
which will be Z_2
Z_3 divided by

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:43.699
Z_2
Z_3,

00:45:43.699 --> 00:45:46.070
just like you combine resistors
in parallel.

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.786
To that guy,
I will add

00:45:47.786 --> 00:45:49.579
Z_1.
 

00:45:49.579 --> 00:45:53.590
That whole thing is the
impedance seen by this thing.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.481
Divide the voltage by this
total effective impedance,

00:45:57.481 --> 00:46:00.849
that will give you the current
coming here.

00:46:00.849 --> 00:46:02.820
Yes?
 

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.132
Take that current,
multiply by

00:46:04.132 --> 00:46:06.259
Z_1 times
e^(iωt),

00:46:06.259 --> 00:46:07.300
take the real part.
 

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:10.230
That's the instantaneous
voltage on this one.

00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:13.226
Here's one more thing:
when that current comes here,

00:46:13.226 --> 00:46:15.929
how is it going to branch
between these two?

00:46:15.929 --> 00:46:17.568
In DC circuits,
if this was

00:46:17.568 --> 00:46:20.929
R_2,
this is R_1,

00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:24.686
and the current comes here,
its propensity to go on this

00:46:24.686 --> 00:46:27.409
side is proportional to that
resistor,

00:46:27.409 --> 00:46:30.472
because if that is more
resistive, it's more likely to

00:46:30.472 --> 00:46:31.050
go here.
 

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:32.701
So the fraction going to this
side will be

00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:34.594
R_2 divided by
R_1

00:46:34.594 --> 00:46:35.480
R_2.
 

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.192
The fraction going to this
branch will be

00:46:37.192 --> 00:46:39.248
R_1 divided by
R_1 

00:46:39.248 --> 00:46:40.190
R_2.
 

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.663
You replace all of the
R's with Z's and

00:46:42.663 --> 00:46:43.900
you get the same result.
 

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:47.047
So you can do everything like
before, except you've got to get

00:46:47.047 --> 00:46:48.389
used to complex numbers.
 

00:46:48.389 --> 00:46:52.567
Here's the problem:
take the circuit assigned to

00:46:52.567 --> 00:46:55.500
each element,
these impedances.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.530
Add them like in the old days,
combine them like in the old

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.099
days, solve for the current.
 

00:47:00.099 --> 00:47:03.875
To get the physical current,
multiply by e^(iωt)

00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:05.829
and take the real part.
 

00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:07.880
To find the drop against any
entry,

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.034
any element,
take the current there times

00:47:10.034 --> 00:47:12.239
the impedance,
times e^(iωt),

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:14.329
then take the real part.
 

00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.869
That's it.
 

00:47:14.869 --> 00:47:17.248
I cannot say it anymore because
I don't know another way to say

00:47:17.248 --> 00:47:17.440
it.
 

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.233
You've just got to do problems
so you get a feeling for how

00:47:21.233 --> 00:47:22.018
it's done.
 

00:47:22.018 --> 00:47:26.389
I wanted you to understand,
sometimes you take a problem,

00:47:26.389 --> 00:47:29.510
you embed it in a bigger family
of problems that looks more

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.460
difficult,
but is actually easier.

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.211
It's even true,
there are many integrals you

00:47:34.211 --> 00:47:35.719
try to do which are very
difficult.

00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:38.682
But if you think of it as an
integral in the complex plane,

00:47:38.682 --> 00:47:41.900
sometimes that problem's easier
to solve than the real integral,

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.230
so this happens a lot.
 

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:44.909
You take a problem,
you generalize it.

00:47:44.909 --> 00:47:47.945
Sometimes the generalized
problem is easier than the

00:47:47.945 --> 00:47:48.840
original one.
 

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.764
Now I'm going to give you one
counter-example,

00:47:52.764 --> 00:47:57.648
let me see where to pick it,
where this rule about taking

00:47:57.648 --> 00:48:01.659
the real part at the end of the
day fails.

00:48:01.659 --> 00:48:05.027
So far the rule was,
do everything with a complex

00:48:05.027 --> 00:48:05.590
thing.
 

00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:07.987
At the end of the day when
you've found something,

00:48:07.987 --> 00:48:09.210
you take the real part.
 

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:12.172
Here is a place where it does
not work, so let me tell you

00:48:12.172 --> 00:48:12.900
where it is.
 

00:48:12.900 --> 00:48:20.215
Take the LCR circuit,
where we found that the voltage

00:48:20.215 --> 00:48:26.829
was V_0
cosωt,

00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:29.735
and the current was
V_0 over

00:48:29.735 --> 00:48:32.510
absolute value of
Zcos(ωt -

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.994
Φ),
where Φ is all that

00:48:34.994 --> 00:48:35.219
stuff.
 

00:48:35.219 --> 00:48:38.119
I don't want to repeat it.
 

00:48:38.119 --> 00:48:44.110
What is the instantaneous power
generated by the power supply?

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:47.440
The instantaneous power for any
voltage source equals the

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.010
voltage at that instant times
the current at that instant.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.530
And all of these are real
voltages and real currents.

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.929
I'm not doing any games right
now.

00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:56.989
This is the real thing.
 

00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:58.780
So what do you get here?
 

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.643
You get
V_0^(2) over

00:49:02.643 --> 00:49:08.438
mod Z cosωt
times cos(ωt -

00:49:08.438 --> 00:49:10.800
Φ).
 

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.389
That's what it is, right?
 

00:49:12.389 --> 00:49:15.641
One voltage going like cos and
the current is going like

00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.889
cos(ωt -
Φ).

00:49:17.889 --> 00:49:21.835
So I want to write this out for
you as follows:

00:49:21.835 --> 00:49:25.695
this is cos^(2)ωt
cosΦ

00:49:25.695 --> 00:49:28.438
sinωt
cosωt

00:49:28.438 --> 00:49:30.670
cosΦ.
 

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:34.840
This is just some high school
trig identities.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.719
Cos of A B is cos
A cos B sine

00:49:39.719 --> 00:49:41.860
A sine B.
 

00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:43.280
So what do you notice?
 

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.471
CosΦ and
sinΦ are some

00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:50.405
constants, but these are
functions of time and they're

00:49:50.405 --> 00:49:51.889
all oscillating.
 

00:49:51.889 --> 00:49:54.784
The reason they are oscillating
is that when you drive a current

00:49:54.784 --> 00:49:56.822
in these circuits,
sometimes the L and

00:49:56.822 --> 00:49:58.719
C are drawing energy from
the source,

00:49:58.719 --> 00:50:01.070
sometimes they're giving it
back.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.434
So sometimes it's not
monotonic, it's not always

00:50:03.434 --> 00:50:04.289
drawing energy.
 

00:50:04.289 --> 00:50:06.820
Sometimes it's taking it,
sometimes it's giving it back.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:09.090
That's all the oscillatory
terms.

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:14.867
So what one likes to study is
called the average power over a

00:50:14.867 --> 00:50:16.119
full cycle.
 

00:50:16.119 --> 00:50:19.260
That means you take this time
dependent function,

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:24.128
you integrate it over time,
over a full cycle at frequency

00:50:24.128 --> 00:50:27.289
ω and you divide by the
time.

00:50:27.289 --> 00:50:29.659
And I ask what you get.
 

00:50:29.659 --> 00:50:33.621
So let me write the obvious
parts, V_0^(2)

00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:34.510
over mod Z.
 

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:37.829
Cosine square is a positive
definite number.

00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:41.199
Its average over a cycle is 1
half.

00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:43.340
I don't know how you want me to
show this.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:47.284
One is to say
cos^(2)θ is 1

00:50:47.284 --> 00:50:49.610
cos2θ/2.
 

00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.061
And if you integrate that guy
over a full cycle,

00:50:52.061 --> 00:50:54.199
the cosine 2θ is
periodic.

00:50:54.199 --> 00:50:56.760
It gives you 0, you get 1 half.
 

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:59.030
Sinωt
cosωt,

00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:02.036
if you put a 2 and divide by 2,
is proportional to

00:51:02.036 --> 00:51:03.510
sin2ωt.
 

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.070
That guy completes 2 cycles in
one period.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:08.230
Its average is definitely 0.
 

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:11.690
So the only thing that survives
then from all of this is the

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:14.329
cosine Φ term and the
1 over 2,

00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:18.440
because average of cosine
squared is half.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.697
So the average power in the
circuit looks like

00:51:22.697 --> 00:51:27.050
V^(2)/2 mod Z
cosΦ.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:31.960
That's the correct result.
 

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.750
In fact, we can see it in
another way.

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:37.992
Let's write it as
V_0 over mod

00:51:37.992 --> 00:51:42.974
Z squared times mod
Z cosine Φ

00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:43.989
over 2.
 

00:51:43.989 --> 00:51:46.030
What is mod Z
cosΦ?

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:51.079
Can you tell from some picture
I drew of Z?

00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:52.139
I don't know if I have any
picture.

00:51:52.139 --> 00:51:53.400
I've hidden all of them.
 

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.800
But here is what Z looks
like.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:57.753
That is Z,
that's Φ,

00:51:57.753 --> 00:52:00.288
this is R,
this is ωL −

00:52:00.288 --> 00:52:01.449
1/ωC.
 

00:52:01.449 --> 00:52:02.920
What is mod Z
cosΦ?

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:03.539
Yes?
 

00:52:03.539 --> 00:52:04.760
Student:  Shouldn't it
just be R?

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.380
Prof: It is just the
resistance.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.519
So this is a fancy way for
R.

00:52:08.519 --> 00:52:11.780
So this is just 1 over 2.
 

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.539
If you want,
it's just the amplitude of the

00:52:14.539 --> 00:52:16.710
current squared times R.
 

00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:20.568
That means the real energy loss
is taking place only in the

00:52:20.568 --> 00:52:21.300
resistor.
 

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:24.157
You can write that as mod
Z cosine Φ if

00:52:24.157 --> 00:52:24.719
you like.
 

00:52:24.719 --> 00:52:26.630
The 1 half is new to AC
circuits.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.016
In a DC circuit,
it's just I^(2)R,

00:52:29.016 --> 00:52:30.449
because it's constant.
 

00:52:30.449 --> 00:52:33.862
Here it's oscillating like a
cosine squared and the average

00:52:33.862 --> 00:52:35.039
of that is 1 half.
 

00:52:35.039 --> 00:52:38.353
So what people sometimes like
to do is to find something

00:52:38.353 --> 00:52:40.476
called the RMS current,
which is

00:52:40.476 --> 00:52:45.121
I_0/√2,
and to define the RMS voltage,

00:52:45.121 --> 00:52:48.349
which is
V_0/√2.

00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:51.664
Then the whole thing looks like
I_0I

00:52:51.664 --> 00:52:54.666
_rms^(2)R,
or if you like,

00:52:54.666 --> 00:52:58.760
V_rms times
I_rms,

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:02.710
period.
 

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.510
Now RMS means root mean squared.
 

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:07.360
There's a reason why for a
trigonometric function,

00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:10.760
it's got a number which is 1
over root 2 times the amplitude,

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:13.376
but I don't want to go into
that, because we don't use it

00:53:13.376 --> 00:53:13.750
again.
 

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:15.409
The main thing to know is that,
if you want,

00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:16.902
you can redefine a new
quantity,

00:53:16.902 --> 00:53:18.443
V_0/√2
and

00:53:18.443 --> 00:53:21.690
I_0/√2,
so that these factors of 2

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:26.302
disappear,
and things look like the good

00:53:26.302 --> 00:53:30.599
old days of resistive circuits.
 

00:53:30.599 --> 00:53:35.353
So very often when they say
this is a 110 volt power supply,

00:53:35.353 --> 00:53:38.820
they really mean the RMS value
110 volts.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.242
That means
V_0/√2 is

00:53:41.242 --> 00:53:41.590
110.
 

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:43.699
V_0 itself is
110 √2.

00:53:43.699 --> 00:53:49.139
So the actual voltage goes up
and down from 110 √2 to

00:53:49.139 --> 00:53:50.639
-110 √2.
 

00:53:50.639 --> 00:53:53.246
Because for computation of
power, the peak amplitude

00:53:53.246 --> 00:53:54.320
doesn't control it.
 

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.726
It's this RMS value that
controls the average power

00:53:59.726 --> 00:54:01.239
consumption.
 

00:54:01.239 --> 00:54:08.454
Now there is a way to get the
power using the complex numbers,

00:54:08.454 --> 00:54:10.110
if you like.
 

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:13.317
I'm going to assign that as a
homework problem,

00:54:13.317 --> 00:54:15.059
rather than do it here.
 

00:54:15.059 --> 00:54:19.030
But I want you to think about
why does it fail here?

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.860
Why is it that when you come to
the power,

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:23.809
this is not simply--in other
words,

00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:28.588
what I'm telling you is the
power is not simply the real

00:54:28.588 --> 00:54:32.760
part of I˜t and
V˜t.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:35.094
V˜ is a 1 with
V_0

00:54:35.094 --> 00:54:36.179
e^(iωt).
 

00:54:36.179 --> 00:54:41.469
Why is it that taking the real
part of this guy doesn't work?

00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:42.918
Everywhere else,
we took the real part of the

00:54:42.918 --> 00:54:44.483
current,
we got the right answer,

00:54:44.483 --> 00:54:48.306
real part of the voltage,
we got the right answer,

00:54:48.306 --> 00:54:52.929
but not when you take the real
part of this.

00:54:52.929 --> 00:54:56.420
Yes?
 

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:57.985
Student:
Yes, he's saying you're

00:54:57.985 --> 00:54:59.179
multiplying but not adding.
 

00:54:59.179 --> 00:55:02.119
So let me say the following:
suppose you had a complex

00:55:02.119 --> 00:55:04.960
number Z_1,
it's x_1

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:07.331
Iy_1,
and another complex number

00:55:07.331 --> 00:55:10.233
Z_2,
which is x_2

00:55:10.233 --> 00:55:11.670
Iy_2.
 

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:14.079
If you take the real part of
Z_1 you get

00:55:14.079 --> 00:55:15.070
x_1.
 

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:17.335
You take the real part of
Z_2 you get

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:18.320
x_2.
 

00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:21.164
But suppose you wanted
x_1x

00:55:21.164 --> 00:55:23.719
_2 for some
reason.

00:55:23.719 --> 00:55:26.288
That is the real part of
Z_1 times the

00:55:26.288 --> 00:55:28.000
real part of
Z_2.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.833
That does not = the real part
of Z_1Z

00:55:31.833 --> 00:55:33.320
_2.
 

00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.684
Because the real part of
Z_1Z

00:55:34.684 --> 00:55:36.047
_2 has got
x_1x

00:55:36.047 --> 00:55:37.661
_2,
that's pretty obvious,

00:55:37.661 --> 00:55:39.106
but it's always got
-y_1

00:55:39.106 --> 00:55:41.016
y_2,
because when these two

00:55:41.016 --> 00:55:45.590
imaginaries multiply,
they can contribute a real part.

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:50.730
But what you wanted is the
analog of this one.

00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:52.360
So you can fix that.
 

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.280
I mean, it's not that you can
never extract x_1x

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:54.889
_2.
 

00:55:54.889 --> 00:55:58.905
The correct solution is
x_1 is Z

00:55:58.905 --> 00:56:01.742
Z* over 2 x2
Z_2

00:56:01.742 --> 00:56:05.934
Z_2* over 2,
and you can multiply it all out

00:56:05.934 --> 00:56:07.010
and see what happens.
 

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:11.199
Then you can write the answer
in terms of these guys,

00:56:11.199 --> 00:56:13.052
if you like,
but I'd rather just leave it

00:56:13.052 --> 00:56:15.307
this way,
because it's not going to be

00:56:15.307 --> 00:56:16.400
used extensively.
 

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.309
I just want you to be careful.
 

00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:21.376
This is an example of something
that is quadratic in the

00:56:21.376 --> 00:56:22.768
interesting quantities.
 

00:56:22.768 --> 00:56:25.550
You cannot take the real part
at the end of the calculation,

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.199
only for things which are
linear.

00:56:27.199 --> 00:56:31.163
Every time, the real and
imaginary parts do not talk to

00:56:31.163 --> 00:56:34.539
each other throughout the whole
calculation.

00:56:34.539 --> 00:56:37.907
You can follow them through and
at the end take the real part as

00:56:37.907 --> 00:56:39.030
what's interesting.
 

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:41.349
But if you're going to multiply
two things,

00:56:41.349 --> 00:56:44.000
where you have added on a
complex part to this guy and a

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.239
complex part to this guy,
in the product,

00:56:46.239 --> 00:56:49.072
you've added on something real,
and that was not your

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:50.860
intention, so you've got to take
that out.

00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:53.500
That's what makes it
complicated.

00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.789
Therefore I tell you that when
you do these AC circuits,

00:56:56.789 --> 00:56:59.960
when it comes to power,
forget any of the gimmicks you

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.679
learned.
 

00:57:00.679 --> 00:57:03.876
You will be usually asked to
find the power only for LCR

00:57:03.876 --> 00:57:07.364
circuit, the single loop like
that, then just go back to this

00:57:07.364 --> 00:57:07.829
one.
 

00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:11.760
It's just I^(2)R written
in this language.

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:17.710
And cosine Φ is
called the power factor.

00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:24.719
Okay, so this completes one
chunk of the course.

00:57:24.719 --> 00:57:26.875
I'm really going to the
finishing line for

00:57:26.875 --> 00:57:28.190
electromagnetic theory.
 

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:32.134
There's only one big stuff
left, then we'll do optics and

00:57:32.134 --> 00:57:34.530
then we'll do quantum mechanics.
 

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:38.719
Now the nice thing about
quantum mechanics is that you

00:57:38.719 --> 00:57:42.594
don't have to worry about
whether you will get it,

00:57:42.594 --> 00:57:44.730
because nobody gets it.
 

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:47.806
My idea is to take a class
where only I don't get it,

00:57:47.806 --> 00:57:51.119
and turn it into a class where
everybody don't get it.

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:53.500
That's the plan.
 

00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:56.425
When I say "get it,"
I think I talked to one of you

00:57:56.425 --> 00:57:59.349
guys who called me and said
something which is quite true.

00:57:59.349 --> 00:58:02.336
They said, "In the first
part of the course,

00:58:02.336 --> 00:58:04.889
we could visualize what you
were doing.

00:58:04.889 --> 00:58:07.699
There were masses rolling down
and things colliding.

00:58:07.699 --> 00:58:11.338
With electricity and magnetism,
we're not afraid of the math,

00:58:11.338 --> 00:58:15.219
but we don't have an intuitive
feeling for these things."

00:58:15.219 --> 00:58:16.730
So I agree.
 

00:58:16.730 --> 00:58:20.188
But if you work long enough
with electricity and magnetism,

00:58:20.188 --> 00:58:21.559
you get used to them.
 

00:58:21.559 --> 00:58:25.105
The only things born with the
knowledge of electricity and

00:58:25.105 --> 00:58:27.780
magnetism are some creatures,
like ducks.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:30.824
Apparently, ducks can feel the
earth's magnetic field and they

00:58:30.824 --> 00:58:33.570
are just going through and they
know which way to go.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:37.661
They don't solve Maxwell's
equation, but they know how to

00:58:37.661 --> 00:58:38.320
travel.
 

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.242
And some bees are sensitive to
the polarization of light,

00:58:41.242 --> 00:58:44.112
so they do respond to certain
things in an intrinsic way

00:58:44.112 --> 00:58:45.000
people don't.
 

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.630
So you have to get used to it
only by doing more problems.

00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:51.449
But in quantum theory,
any intuitive feeling you have

00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:53.360
is actually a detriment.
 

00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.744
It will get you in trouble,
because nothing is the way you

00:58:55.744 --> 00:58:56.289
imagine it.
 

00:58:56.289 --> 00:58:59.179
So no one has an advantage over
anybody else.

00:58:59.179 --> 00:59:01.530
So it's better not to be well
informed.

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:04.085
So you may be saying,
"Hey, here is the course

00:59:04.085 --> 00:59:05.210
for me,"
right?

00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:07.885
So the less you know,
the better off you are in

00:59:07.885 --> 00:59:09.050
quantum mechanics.
 

00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:10.300
So don't worry about that.
 

00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:14.045
It's a very strange world and I
want to give you an introduction

00:59:14.045 --> 00:59:14.639
to that.
 

00:59:14.639 --> 00:59:16.440
Anyway, they are the two things.
 

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.976
So what's left now is just
electromagnetic waves,

00:59:18.976 --> 00:59:21.989
and we're sort of building up
to electromagnetic waves.

00:59:21.989 --> 00:59:27.483
So I'm going to start by
writing here the equations that

00:59:27.483 --> 00:59:31.780
we know about electromagnetism
as of now.

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.260
So the surface integral of the
electric field on any surface is

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:40.739
the charge enclosed divided by
ε_0.

00:59:40.739 --> 00:59:44.460
That's called Gauss's law.
 

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:48.434
The line integral of the
electric field on a closed loop

00:59:48.434 --> 00:59:51.179
used to be 0 when things are
static.

00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:56.925
But when things are changing
with time, it's the rate of

00:59:56.925 --> 01:00:00.059
change of the magnetic flux.
 

01:00:00.059 --> 01:00:02.889
The surface integral of the
magnetic field,

01:00:02.889 --> 01:00:06.074
B⋅dA
is just 0 all the time,

01:00:06.074 --> 01:00:08.599
because there are no magnetic
monopoles.

01:00:08.599 --> 01:00:11.340
There's nothing from which
lines come out.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.300
So if you integrate any
configuration,

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:16.536
the lines don't start and end
anywhere, so whatever enters the

01:00:16.536 --> 01:00:18.179
surface leaves the surface.
 

01:00:18.179 --> 01:00:20.210
The surface integral of
B is always 0.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:21.829
B⋅dA
is 0.

01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:23.563
The line integral of
B⋅

01:00:23.563 --> 01:00:25.811
dA--b
⋅dl is

01:00:25.811 --> 01:00:27.170
μ_0I.
 

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:32.789
That's the old Ampere's law.
 

01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:37.969
These are the four equations we
have.

01:00:37.969 --> 01:00:42.440
Now it turns out this is not
still the end.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.030
It's not the end.
 

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:45.909
There's one more fiddling you
have to do.

01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:48.309
That's the last part I want to
talk about.

01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:52.070
Remember, this itself came from
new experiments where you

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.489
started moving magnets and so
on,

01:00:54.489 --> 01:00:56.748
found a current whenever
there's a changing magnetic

01:00:56.748 --> 01:00:57.059
flux.
 

01:00:57.059 --> 01:01:01.139
That's the induced electric
field due to changing flux.

01:01:01.139 --> 01:01:06.036
So here is the thought process
that led Mr. Maxwell to a

01:01:06.036 --> 01:01:07.730
little paradox.
 

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.829
So here is some circuit.
 

01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:10.219
We don't know where it begins
or ends;

01:01:10.219 --> 01:01:10.969
we don't care.
 

01:01:10.969 --> 01:01:12.070
Here's the circuit.
 

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.719
There's a current flowing
through a capacitor.

01:01:15.719 --> 01:01:18.416
When I say flowing through a
capacitor, I hope you know what

01:01:18.416 --> 01:01:18.920
it means.
 

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:21.380
I want you to be very clear
about this.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.489
Suppose you connect it to some
AC source.

01:01:23.489 --> 01:01:25.599
I want you all to know what's
going on.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.139
Nothing really flows through
the gap in the capacitor.

01:01:28.139 --> 01:01:29.550
It's not possible.
 

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:31.300
What happens is,
for a while,

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:34.550
charges rush here and - charges
rush the other plate,

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:37.550
because that's the polarity of
my AC source.

01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:41.945
Later on it's reversed,
then - charges go here and

01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:43.650
charges go there.
 

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.557
So there is an alternating
current in the circuit,

01:01:46.557 --> 01:01:50.179
but there is no current flowing
right through in one sense.

01:01:50.179 --> 01:01:53.117
But there's nothing to keep it
from going this way and that way

01:01:53.117 --> 01:01:55.818
and this way and that way,
because they don't have to jump

01:01:55.818 --> 01:01:56.909
the gap to do that.
 

01:01:56.909 --> 01:01:58.070
Yes?
 

01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:00.251
Student:  It's sort of a
random question,

01:02:00.251 --> 01:02:02.900
but you know how we were
talking about jumping the gap.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.909
When would it actually jump the
gap?

01:02:06.909 --> 01:02:10.534
Prof: It will jump the
gap if the--here is what

01:02:10.534 --> 01:02:11.219
happens.
 

01:02:11.219 --> 01:02:13.730
It depends on what's in the
medium.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.108
If you put air,
for example,

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:19.369
the air molecules are all
neutral,

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:24.315
so there is no way for the
charges to ride them and go to

01:02:24.315 --> 01:02:27.400
the - charge,
to the - terminal.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.349
But if the electric fields,
this certainly will produce

01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:32.429
electric field,
they're so strong that they rip

01:02:32.429 --> 01:02:35.583
out the and - charges,
that suddenly you've got a

01:02:35.583 --> 01:02:37.826
bunch of free carriers,
then the - charges can

01:02:37.826 --> 01:02:39.719
immediately go and neutralize
this one,

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:42.150
can go and neutralize that one.
 

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.280
That's like a lightning strike
inside the little world.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:47.570
That's what happens to us
during lightning.

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:48.909
We are in a capacitor.
 

01:02:48.909 --> 01:02:52.268
The lower plate is the earth,
upper plate is the clouds.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.849
And after a while,
there's a heavy charging.

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:56.610
At some point,
they cannot take it anymore,

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.440
and they ionize the air and
they create a little path and

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:05.070
the current flows through that,
and the clouds are discharged.

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:08.340
Okay, so here is a problem that
Maxwell had.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.699
He says, let's look at this
equation,

01:03:10.699 --> 01:03:14.179
B⋅dl
in a closed loop =

01:03:14.179 --> 01:03:18.525
μ_0I,
where I is the current passing

01:03:18.525 --> 01:03:22.539
through any surface with that
loop as the boundary.

01:03:22.539 --> 01:03:24.929
Remember that?
 

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:31.956
So if you draw a loop here like
that, then some current is

01:03:31.956 --> 01:03:35.780
crossing that shaded surface.
 

01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.039
And the line integral of
B,

01:03:37.039 --> 01:03:39.650
you know B fields go
around the current and the line

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.034
integral of B around a
loop will be the current

01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:43.519
crossing that shaded surface.
 

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:46.179
That's how we get Ampere's law.
 

01:03:46.179 --> 01:03:49.257
But now you say,
that's not the only surface

01:03:49.257 --> 01:03:51.619
with that loop as the boundary.
 

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.427
I should be able to draw any
surface with the loop as the

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:54.980
boundary.
 

01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:59.670
So you say let me take that
surface.

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:03.079
You are still okay,
because whatever current passes

01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:06.079
this phase also passes through
that phase.

01:04:06.079 --> 01:04:09.619
The law is still good.
 

01:04:09.619 --> 01:04:14.800
So giddy with success,
you say, why not this?

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.400
That's my new surface.
 

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.275
It goes all the way around one
of the plates of the capacitor

01:04:19.275 --> 01:04:20.090
and comes back.
 

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.590
Now I have a problem.
 

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:27.239
I have a problem because there
is no current passing that

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:28.070
surface.
 

01:04:28.070 --> 01:04:31.639
Nothing going on between the
plates in terms of current.

01:04:31.639 --> 01:04:34.085
If I draw an even bigger one
like this one,

01:04:34.085 --> 01:04:36.706
I am again okay,
because now that same current

01:04:36.706 --> 01:04:38.570
is passing through this one.
 

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:44.550
It's this surface in between
that things don't work.

01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:45.190
You follow that?
 

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.313
We have a crisis where if you
say it's

01:04:47.313 --> 01:04:50.759
μ_0I and you
say it's on any surface with

01:04:50.759 --> 01:04:53.889
this loop as the boundary,
it's the boundary of the

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.969
surface, then this kind of
surface,

01:04:55.969 --> 01:04:58.840
half in and half out,
has a problem.

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.980
So what will you do?
 

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.219
You realize you have to modify
your equations.

01:05:07.219 --> 01:05:09.320
It's quite often how people
modify equations.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.500
Sometimes they do experiments,
sometimes they do thought

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.309
experiments.
 

01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:16.327
Einstein loved doing these
experiments, which are called

01:05:16.327 --> 01:05:17.590
Gedanken experiments.
 

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:19.581
You don't really do the
experiment, but you say,

01:05:19.581 --> 01:05:21.530
"If I did this,
what will happen?"

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:24.972
There's a little paradox,
and you have to modify your

01:05:24.972 --> 01:05:25.570
theory.
 

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.070
So there are two reasons to
modify the theory.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.909
One is experiments tell you is
wrong;

01:05:28.909 --> 01:05:31.989
other is, theory tells you
there's a problem.

01:05:31.989 --> 01:05:36.980
So you have to add something to
this.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:42.755
That something I add should not
have any contribution from this

01:05:42.755 --> 01:05:44.780
surface,
but on this surface,

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:47.737
it should make exactly the same
contribution as the physical

01:05:47.737 --> 01:05:50.760
current made on this surface,
so that no matter which surface

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.510
I take,
I get the same answer.

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.449
And I'm going to do that by
the--there are many ways to do

01:05:56.449 --> 01:05:56.809
this.
 

01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:59.414
If you know more math,
there are more ways to get

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:01.750
this, but this is one that's
good enough.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:02.690
I'm going to do the following?
 

01:06:02.690 --> 01:06:07.659
I'm going to rewrite this as
follows.

01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:10.036
You see in the region between
the plates, I have no current,

01:06:10.036 --> 01:06:10.440
I agree.
 

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.699
I gave up.
 

01:06:12.699 --> 01:06:15.739
I do have something between the
plates I don't have in the wire.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:18.130
You know what that is?
 

01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:18.960
Pardon me?
 

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.119
Student:  Electric field.
 

01:06:20.119 --> 01:06:21.420
Prof: You have an
electric field.

01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:23.650
There's something non 0 in
between the plates.

01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:26.172
So I'm going to write this
μ_0I somehow

01:06:26.172 --> 01:06:28.693
in terms of electric field
between the plates and let's see

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:29.389
how it goes.
 

01:06:29.389 --> 01:06:35.710
So I'm rewriting the very same
term, I is dQ/dt.

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:38.030
Q is the charge of the
capacitor.

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:43.851
And let me write it as
Q/ε_0 d

01:06:43.851 --> 01:06:45.469
by dt.
 

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:50.141
Now let me write it as
μ_0ε

01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:54.626
_0Ad by dt of
Q/A divided by

01:06:54.626 --> 01:06:57.710
ε_0.
 

01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:00.965
That =
μ_0ε

01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:05.849
_0A times
d by dt of the

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:09.489
electric field between the
plates.

01:07:09.489 --> 01:07:10.239
Why is that?
 

01:07:10.239 --> 01:07:14.472
Because the electric field is
σ/

01:07:14.472 --> 01:07:19.871
ε_0 and
σ is just

01:07:19.871 --> 01:07:21.460
Q/A.
 

01:07:21.460 --> 01:07:25.530
Now bring that A in here
and you get μ_0

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:29.271
ε_0 d by
dt of electric field

01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:30.518
times A.
 

01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:33.791
But that we can write as
μ_0ε

01:07:33.791 --> 01:07:37.099
_0,
the surface integral of the

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:41.387
electric field over the surface,
and that's what we call

01:07:41.387 --> 01:07:45.989
μ_0ε
_0 electric flux,

01:07:45.989 --> 01:07:48.329
d by dt.
 

01:07:48.329 --> 01:07:51.503
Therefore my modified law is
going to be

01:07:51.503 --> 01:07:55.735
B⋅dl =
μ_0I

01:07:55.735 --> 01:07:59.478
μ_0
ε_0 d by

01:07:59.478 --> 01:08:04.280
dt of Φ
_electric.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.030
That's the bottom line.
 

01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:09.909
You can fill in these blanks if
you have trouble writing and

01:08:09.909 --> 01:08:10.699
listening.
 

01:08:10.699 --> 01:08:12.840
I'm just saying,
go to the region between the

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.280
plates.
 

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:14.565
Once you start with
dQ/dt,

01:08:14.565 --> 01:08:16.052
turn Q into the
σ,

01:08:16.052 --> 01:08:17.538
the charge density on the
plates.

01:08:17.538 --> 01:08:20.380
That's simply the electric
field, then you'll find,

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:24.288
this is simply the electric
flux, rate of change times

01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:27.828
μ_0ε
_0.

01:08:27.828 --> 01:08:38.319
This extra term is called the
displacement current.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:41.238
I don't know why it's called
that name, but you know that you

01:08:41.238 --> 01:08:42.698
have to put that extra term.
 

01:08:42.698 --> 01:08:45.739
But now look at this equation
with that extra term.

01:08:45.739 --> 01:08:49.050
Notice it works everywhere.
 

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:51.140
If you took a surface like the
first one I took,

01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:54.613
that slices through the wire
here, there's no electric field

01:08:54.613 --> 01:08:56.797
anywhere,
inside a perfect conductor or

01:08:56.797 --> 01:08:59.186
anything,
there's going to be no electric

01:08:59.186 --> 01:08:59.600
field.
 

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:03.800
Then μ_0I
is going to contribute.

01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.051
If I go to the region between
the plates, there is no I

01:09:07.051 --> 01:09:10.090
there, but there's the rate of
change of electric flux.

01:09:10.090 --> 01:09:13.590
Therefore the last Maxwell
equation,

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:17.173
the Ampere's law,
is going to be modified with an

01:09:17.173 --> 01:09:19.048
extra term,
μ_0

01:09:19.048 --> 01:09:20.708
ε_0
dΦ

01:09:20.708 --> 01:09:22.500
_electric
/dt.

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.743
And it has a nice symmetry now,
that the line integral of the

01:09:25.743 --> 01:09:28.770
electric field is the rate of
change of magnetic flux.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.573
The line integral of the
magnetic field contains a rate

01:09:31.573 --> 01:09:33.078
of change of electric flux.
 

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:37.390
It's got other stuff,
but it's got that extra term.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:41.918
So I'm going to come next time
and start looking at these

01:09:41.918 --> 01:09:42.890
equations.
 

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:46.018
And remarkably,
these equations imply there are

01:09:46.018 --> 01:09:47.649
electromagnetic waves.
 

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:51.988
Without the benefit of any
charge, without the benefit of

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:56.329
any current, there'll be
electric and magnetic fields.

01:09:56.329 --> 01:09:58.020
That's the interesting part.
 

01:09:58.020 --> 01:10:00.838
We know electric fields can be
produced by charges,

01:10:00.838 --> 01:10:03.489
and magnetic fields can be
produced by currents,

01:10:03.489 --> 01:10:06.310
but I'm saying go light years
from everything.

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:09.689
No ρ, no charge density,
no current density.

01:10:09.689 --> 01:10:12.305
There'll be non-zero E
and B just moving on

01:10:12.305 --> 01:10:14.970
their own, and you want to
understand how that happens.

01:10:14.970 --> 01:10:17.488
First of all,
it's amazing it's predicted by

01:10:17.488 --> 01:10:18.250
this stuff.
 

01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:21.588
So basically,
this is a very important day in

01:10:21.588 --> 01:10:26.369
your life, because now you know,
all of electromagnetism is that

01:10:26.369 --> 01:10:28.420
equation that equation.
 

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:30.238
This is it.
 

01:10:30.238 --> 01:10:33.126
There is no more stuff any of
us knows, at least in classical

01:10:33.126 --> 01:10:33.560
theory.
 

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.250
In quantum theory,
there's new stuff.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:39.710
Classical electromagnetism is
only that.

01:10:39.710 --> 01:10:42.788
So you don't have to pack your
head with all kinds of results.

01:10:42.788 --> 01:10:47.100
You can derive everything from
these.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.090
Okay, so let's do that on
Wednesday.

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:56.000

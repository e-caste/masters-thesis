00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:09.710
Prof: The lecture today
is about neutral evolution.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.060
So let's get going on that.
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.646
I want to remind you,
when people think about

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.630
evolution they often think that
it's only natural selection.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.810
But it's not.
 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.300
It is both micro and macro.
 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.216
So macro gives us history and
constraint, and micro consists

00:00:33.216 --> 00:00:36.800
basically of natural selection
and drift;

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.790
and developmental biology is
involved in both.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.180
So what we're going to talk
about today is basically neutral

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.480
evolution.
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.828
What happens to genes or traits
that are not experiencing

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:54.638
natural selection because
they're not making any

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:56.970
difference to reproductive
success?

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.843
There's actually a lot of that
that goes on,

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.250
and it's very useful that it
does.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.218
It gives us a baseline,
it gives us a method of

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:07.864
measuring things,
and it gives us a lot of

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:09.799
information about history.
 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.423
So there are going to be three
messages I want you to remember

00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:15.030
today.
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.090
One is going to be how meiosis
is like a fair coin.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.421
The probability that a gene
will get into a specific gamete

00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:26.260
in meiosis is 50%.
 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.485
The second point is how the
fixation of a neutral allele in

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:35.180
a population is like radioactive
decay;

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.943
and it's like it in this sense:
in neither the case of the

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:43.400
fixation of neutral alleles,
nor in the case of say looking

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.631
at a gram of uranium-238,
do you know which mutation will

00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.959
be fixed or which atom will
decay.

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.010
But, because there's so many of
them, in both cases you know

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.231
very precisely how many events
will happen in a certain period

00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:01.260
of time.
 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.920
Okay?
 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.420
This is a kind of law of large
numbers for random events.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.443
If a lot of random events go
on, the average is a very

00:02:12.443 --> 00:02:14.340
predictable thing.
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.110
But if you just examine one
nucleotide in a genome,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.230
or one atom in a gram of
uranium, you can't predict when

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.253
it will mutate,
when it might be fixed,

00:02:27.253 --> 00:02:28.710
when it will decay.
 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.008
The third thing that I want you
to remember is this regular

00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:38.876
fixation of neutral alleles,
this steady process whereby if

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:42.566
you look at an entire genome,
over a given period of

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:46.609
time--10,000 years,
100,000 years--a certain very

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.223
predictable,
average number of mutations

00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:50.979
will be fixed if they're
neutral.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.633
So if you can locate the
neutral ones in the genome,

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:58.789
you can use them to estimate
relationships and the times to

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:00.939
the last common ancestors.
 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:01.750
Okay?
 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.263
So there's actually some
interesting, rather abstract and

00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:07.460
rather big ideas in this
lecture.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.389
Randomness is not something
that everyone finds intuitive.

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:17.782
Our brains are apparently not
designed by natural selection to

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:21.960
deal extremely well with Las
Vegas, or the stock market.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.908
Okay?
 

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:30.204
So we need to hone your
intuition a bit about how random

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:32.150
processes work.
 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.497
By the way, people who do
really well in calculus and

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:39.101
analysis often find their
introduction to probability and

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.288
statistics a little confusing.
 

00:03:41.288 --> 00:03:44.609
The thing that's going on here
is that you have to learn to

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.413
think about entire populations
of things and about

00:03:47.413 --> 00:03:49.990
distributions and frequencies of
things,

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.179
rather than about billiard
balls hitting each other on a

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:57.759
table or planets being attracted
to the sun,

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:58.889
by gravity.
 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:03:59.780
It's a different kind of
thinking.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.460
It's population thinking.
 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.883
So the outline of the lecture
is a bit about how neutrality

00:04:07.883 --> 00:04:08.878
arises.
 

00:04:08.878 --> 00:04:11.758
I want you to know
mechanistically why it is that

00:04:11.758 --> 00:04:15.063
some genes are neutral;
the reasons why genetic

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:19.379
variation might not produce any
variation in fitness--

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:22.579
that's what we mean by neutral,
there's variation at one level

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.149
but it doesn't make any
difference to reproductive

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.598
success;
the mechanisms that cause

00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:30.682
random change;
and then the significance of

00:04:30.682 --> 00:04:33.029
neutral for molecular evolution.
 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.826
And now I'm briefly going to
mention maladaptive evolution so

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:40.495
that you can see how it is that
an evolutionary process can

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:44.165
actually result in a situation
where organisms are not well

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.190
adapted to their habitats.
 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.548
And with that we will have
covered the major possible

00:04:50.548 --> 00:04:54.571
outcomes of evolution:
adaptation, neutrality and

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.079
maladaptation.
 

00:04:56.079 --> 00:05:02.415
Okay, here's a nice abstract
diagram to explain why

00:05:02.415 --> 00:05:04.949
neutrality arises.
 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.350
What I want you to imagine is a
genotype space in which all

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.100
possible genotypes for that
organism might occur.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.706
Just think about that as being
all the different ways that you

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:21.603
might have been constructed if
all of the possible

00:05:21.603 --> 00:05:25.031
recombination events in your
father and mother had produced

00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:28.579
all the possible gametes and all
the possible zygotes.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.940
There's a genotype space for
you.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.750
Many of those genotypes will
produce the same phenotype,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.264
and that's because many of the
genes and many of the

00:05:42.264 --> 00:05:46.786
nucleotides in the genome,
many of the DNA sequences in

00:05:46.786 --> 00:05:49.422
the genome,
are not making any difference

00:05:49.422 --> 00:05:52.240
to the proteins that are being
produced.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.690
There are other things going on
and we'll run through them.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.100
Many phenotypes have the same
fitness.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.160
How many of you come from
one-child families?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.689
Okay, all of your parents have
the same fitness.

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:08.899
How many from two-child
families?

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:10.899
All of your parents have the
same fitness.

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:11.509
Okay?
 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:12.790
This happens a lot.
 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.564
Basically when we say that many
phenotypes have the same

00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:17.382
fitness,
we just mean that in any

00:06:17.382 --> 00:06:20.540
population there will be a lot
of organisms that all have two

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.382
offspring or all have three
offspring or something like

00:06:23.382 --> 00:06:23.910
that.
 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.620
The two offspring class all
have the same fitness.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.120
Then when we look at the whole
halfway here,

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.035
we can see that G1,
G2 and G3 are neutral with

00:06:38.035 --> 00:06:41.815
respect to each other,
when measured in a certain

00:06:41.815 --> 00:06:45.160
environment,
but they differ from G4.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.279
So here we have a lot of
genetic variation that's

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:51.399
neutral, and it's neutral for
various reasons.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.329
We're going to run through some
of those reasons.

00:06:53.329 --> 00:07:02.639
First, some of the mutations in
DNA sequences are synonymous.

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:07.317
That means they don't produce
any change in the amino acids

00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:09.980
that are coded in the proteins.
 

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.009
Secondly, there are pseudogenes
and other kinds of

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.970
non-transcribed DNA in the
genome.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.009
A pseudogene is a gene that
resulted from a gene duplication

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:25.459
event sometime in the past and
never got used to make anything.

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:28.589
And if you go through an entire
genome,

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:30.930
which you now can do for many
organisms,

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.771
looking for these things,
you will find that they're all

00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:35.959
over the place.
 

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:38.230
There have been many gene
duplications in the past,

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.228
and some of them resulted in
genes that were then acquired by

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:46.726
selection and used
developmentally for some

00:07:46.726 --> 00:07:47.810
function.
 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.069
Others were not.
 

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:51.720
The pseudogenes are the ones
that weren't used.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.370
Their usual fate is to be
eroded by mutation.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.137
So gradually the useful
information that was once in

00:08:01.137 --> 00:08:06.822
them gets destroyed by mutation,
and if they sit around long

00:08:06.822 --> 00:08:10.220
enough they are no longer
detectible;

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:13.261
you can't tell anymore that
they were once really a

00:08:13.261 --> 00:08:16.060
functional gene,
before they got duplicated.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.964
There's neutral amino acid
variation, for a variety of

00:08:20.964 --> 00:08:21.889
reasons.
 

00:08:21.889 --> 00:08:26.882
Some amino acids have very
similar molecular size and

00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:30.514
charge properties,
so that if you substitute them

00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:33.583
in a protein they don't really
make much difference to the

00:08:33.583 --> 00:08:36.330
shape or the charge distribution
on the protein.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.538
And if you look at a whole
protein,

00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:40.950
which is usually a pretty big
thing--

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.230
say if it's an enzyme--normally
it will have an active site that

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.220
is in a very small spatial
portion of it,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:51.385
so that the amino acid
substations that are occurring

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:54.917
right at the active site are
making a big difference to its

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.515
function,
and then potentially down the

00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:59.644
line to fitness,
and the amino acid

00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:03.357
substitutions that are occurring
a long way from that active site

00:09:03.357 --> 00:09:06.840
are having little impact on the
function of the protein,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.351
even if they have a different
size or a different charge

00:09:09.351 --> 00:09:09.899
structure.
 

00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:13.308
So there's neutral amino acid
variation,

00:09:13.308 --> 00:09:16.625
and finally there's something
which is a little bit more

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:19.243
abstract,
and basically it's abstract

00:09:19.243 --> 00:09:22.259
because we don't understand it
very well--

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:25.476
it's a real phenomenon but we
don't always know what the

00:09:25.476 --> 00:09:29.080
mechanisms are--
and that is the canalization of

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.149
development.
 

00:09:30.149 --> 00:09:35.043
So I'll run through these and
then try to explain canalization

00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:37.529
a little bit in a few slides.
 

00:09:37.529 --> 00:09:40.549
Here is, uh,
the genetic code,

00:09:40.549 --> 00:09:47.006
and basically you can see here
the nucleotide triplets that are

00:09:47.006 --> 00:09:51.590
translated into the various
amino acids.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:56.206
And the take-home point,
the first take-home point from

00:09:56.206 --> 00:09:59.336
this,
is that for any particular

00:09:59.336 --> 00:10:01.591
amino acid--
phenylalanine,

00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:04.542
for example,
here there are two codes for

00:10:04.542 --> 00:10:08.970
phenylalanine,
and look there are six codes

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.408
for leucine.
 

00:10:10.408 --> 00:10:15.284
So any changes within this set
of nucleotide sequences produce

00:10:15.284 --> 00:10:20.399
no change at all in the amino
acid that goes into the protein.

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:24.013
They are neutral with respect
to each other,

00:10:24.013 --> 00:10:26.450
because they're synonymous.
 

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:32.735
And you can get some hint of
another level of synonymity by

00:10:32.735 --> 00:10:38.586
looking at the classes of
positively-negatively charged

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:42.477
amino acids,
aromatic amino acids and so

00:10:42.477 --> 00:10:43.009
forth.
 

00:10:43.009 --> 00:10:47.450
Substitutions between aspartic
acid and glutamic acid,

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.254
that are both negatively
charged, are less likely to make

00:10:52.254 --> 00:10:57.230
a fitness difference than a
substitution say of lysine,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.490
for glutamic acid.
 

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:06.200
So there is a level in the
protein as well.

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.440
The pseudogenes I've talked
about a little bit.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:16.480
They are not transcribed and
all of their nucleotides are

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.500
free to diverge at random.
 

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.101
That means that there is no
real editing process going

00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:26.703
on--natural selection isn't
preferring one mutation to

00:11:26.703 --> 00:11:27.519
another.
 

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:30.013
It's not any more likely to
turn up in children or

00:11:30.013 --> 00:11:31.490
grandchildren than another.
 

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.293
This gene has been turned off,
and it will inevitably get

00:11:37.293 --> 00:11:43.924
eroded because all DNA sequences
are subject to mutation and if a

00:11:43.924 --> 00:11:49.385
mutation occurs in a pseudogene,
there isn't any particular

00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:53.076
reason for repair mechanisms to
pay any more attention to it

00:11:53.076 --> 00:11:55.139
than they do to anything else.
 

00:11:55.139 --> 00:11:55.595
Okay?
 

00:11:55.595 --> 00:12:00.333
So these things are not
especially repaired by repair

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:05.072
mechanisms and they're not at
all repaired by natural

00:12:05.072 --> 00:12:06.440
selection.
 

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:13.024
So this comment will apply to a
lot of the DNA that's not

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:14.668
transcribed.
 

00:12:14.668 --> 00:12:17.383
Now fifteen,
twenty years ago,

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:21.220
when this class of DNA was
discovered,

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.495
people labeled it 'junk DNA'
because they didn't think it did

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.384
anything,
and of course it's been then

00:12:28.384 --> 00:12:32.087
the pleasure of younger
scientists to show the older

00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:36.519
ones that this stuff actually
often does have a function--

00:12:36.519 --> 00:12:38.580
usually it's a regulatory
function.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.543
Some of it makes small RNA
molecules that are used in

00:12:43.543 --> 00:12:47.547
regulation,
but some of it is also being

00:12:47.547 --> 00:12:50.350
used as,
uh, sites and signaling

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.048
pathways and helping to regulate
development.

00:12:54.048 --> 00:12:56.139
However, some of it truly is
junk.

00:12:56.139 --> 00:13:00.836
For example,
there is a steady process by

00:13:00.836 --> 00:13:07.412
which viruses of various sorts
splice themselves into the

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:12.466
genomes of their hosts,
and this is part of the

00:13:12.466 --> 00:13:16.690
adaptive strategy of viruses
that they are able to hedge

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.528
their bets by sticking
themselves into a genome and

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:24.600
hanging around for awhile and
then popping out,

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.427
at a point which might be
advantageous to them but

00:13:27.427 --> 00:13:29.158
inconvenient for their host.
 

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:32.932
However, it's a dangerous
strategy because sometimes they

00:13:32.932 --> 00:13:36.434
stick themselves into parts of
genomes that never get

00:13:36.434 --> 00:13:39.129
transcribed, and they never get
out.

00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:44.269
So in fact the genomes of most
of the organisms on earth are

00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:48.450
littered with the fossil
skeletons of viruses.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.687
I read an estimate once that
the human genome had a

00:13:52.687 --> 00:13:56.840
substantial percentage of fossil
viruses in it.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.288
I have forgotten the exact
figure at the time.

00:13:59.288 --> 00:14:02.769
This kind of thing was popular
when DNA sequences were first

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:05.129
starting to come out in large
numbers.

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:06.409
But just know that.
 

00:14:06.409 --> 00:14:06.960
Okay?
 

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.837
So there is junk DNA,
and some of it's there because

00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:13.879
either fossil viruses or
transposons,

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:16.068
jumping genes,
got into positions where they

00:14:16.068 --> 00:14:20.326
could no longer be transcribed,
and they then become a

00:14:20.326 --> 00:14:21.590
graveyard.
 

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.245
Kind of an uncomfortable
thought isn't it,

00:14:24.245 --> 00:14:27.679
that you're just carrying
around a viral graveyard?

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:28.720
But you are.
 

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.678
Okay, neutral amino acid
variation.

00:14:32.678 --> 00:14:35.440
I've talked about this a bit
when I introduced the genetic

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:35.779
code.
 

00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:39.990
So these are amino acid
substitutions that aren't

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:45.163
producing any change in geometry
or any charge change in the

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:50.251
geometry and electrochemistry of
a functional site within a

00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:51.480
protein.
 

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.488
And I'd like to talk a little
bit about a very early case of

00:14:54.488 --> 00:14:57.610
molecular evolution;
that's the case of alpha-globin.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:02.620
So your hemoglobin has two
alpha and two non-alpha chains.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.552
It has a beta chain if you're
an adult and it has a gamma

00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.019
chain if you're an embryo.
 

00:15:07.019 --> 00:15:09.971
The reason it changes from a
gamma to a beta is to change the

00:15:09.971 --> 00:15:12.798
oxygen binding properties,
because embryos have to suck

00:15:12.798 --> 00:15:14.600
oxygen out of their mother's
blood.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.940
Okay?
 

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.990
If we look at these
alpha-globin sequences,

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.769
across a pretty broad range of
vertebrates,

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:31.325
and we take samples in such a
way that we can look fairly far

00:15:31.325 --> 00:15:34.528
back in time,
we can date these branch points

00:15:34.528 --> 00:15:37.029
approximately from the fossil
records.

00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:38.090
Okay?
 

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:43.760
So dogs and humans shared an
ancestor probably somewhere late

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.110
in the Cretaceous,
mid--late mid-Cretaceous.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.871
Our last common ancestor with
the kangaroo was at about 140

00:15:51.871 --> 00:15:53.428
million years perhaps.
 

00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:55.678
The mammals were there while
the dinosaurs were there.

00:15:55.678 --> 00:15:58.412
They were just small little
guys, but there were mammals

00:15:58.412 --> 00:15:58.808
there.
 

00:15:58.808 --> 00:16:03.994
Our last common ancestor with
the shark is back at about 440

00:16:03.994 --> 00:16:05.399
million years.
 

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:09.264
So take the sequences for all
the alpha hemoglobins that you

00:16:09.264 --> 00:16:13.063
pull out of these things--
it's a convenient molecule,

00:16:13.063 --> 00:16:16.558
you just need a blood sample--
and plot them on a graph.

00:16:16.558 --> 00:16:20.711
So you estimate the time from
the fossils and you estimate the

00:16:20.711 --> 00:16:22.210
average differences.
 

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:24.868
This "k"
is a measure of amino acid

00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:28.745
differences in a protein,
and the straight line is what

00:16:28.745 --> 00:16:33.344
you would expect to get if the
rate of amino acid substitution

00:16:33.344 --> 00:16:37.860
is random,
just uniform, just steady.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.259
Okay?
 

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:41.860
It's pretty close to the line.
 

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.440
There are some deviations.
 

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.288
But this is some of the
earliest evidence--

00:16:46.288 --> 00:16:48.950
this was before DNA sequencing
became easy,

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.672
this was when protein
sequencing was easier than DNA

00:16:51.672 --> 00:16:53.971
sequencing--
this was some of the earliest

00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.970
evidence that there's something
like a molecular clock.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:17:00.070
In other words,
if we got a vertebrate that

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:03.518
we'd never seen before,
living in some forgotten

00:17:03.518 --> 00:17:07.019
jungle, and it had a weird
morphology and we didn't know

00:17:07.019 --> 00:17:10.656
who its relatives were,
and we wanted to find out when

00:17:10.656 --> 00:17:14.618
it might have shared an ancestor
with something that we had,

00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:20.226
and it plotted right here--its
difference with something that

00:17:20.226 --> 00:17:23.868
we were comparing it with right
now,

00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:27.440
plotted right here--then we
would have a good estimate of

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:30.325
time to last common ancestor,
for that new,

00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:34.320
undiscovered species,
based on the assumption that it

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.680
was experiencing evolution like
all these other guys.

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:47.307
Okay, the fourth reason why
genetic variation might be

00:17:47.307 --> 00:17:51.538
neutral is canalization.
 

00:17:51.538 --> 00:17:55.280
Now canalization in general
means that there are

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.579
developmental mechanisms that
are limiting the range of

00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:04.425
phenotypic variation,
so that even though there is a

00:18:04.425 --> 00:18:08.460
mutation in the genome,
or there is a disturbing

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.690
environmental effect on a
genetically controlled pathway,

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.160
that you're still going to get
the same phenotype.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.440
Some things about your
phenotype are extremely stable.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:25.098
They do not respond to mutation
much at all.

00:18:25.098 --> 00:18:27.690
The fact that you have four
limbs, the fact that you've got

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:30.451
five fingers;
things like that are ancient

00:18:30.451 --> 00:18:33.961
and stable and there are
developmental buffering

00:18:33.961 --> 00:18:36.798
mechanisms that keep them that
way.

00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:40.143
So these things,
these canalizing mechanisms,

00:18:40.143 --> 00:18:44.094
resist the tendency of
variation in either genetic or

00:18:44.094 --> 00:18:47.970
environmental factors to perturb
the phenotype;

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:49.470
they keep it in a stable state.
 

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.517
So what happens to the genes
that are forming this phenotype

00:18:53.517 --> 00:18:57.838
but they're being buffered by
these developmental mechanisms?

00:18:57.838 --> 00:19:01.500
Well they are then freer to
accumulate neutral variation,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.897
because basically the fitness
consequences of a mutation in

00:19:06.897 --> 00:19:11.348
those genes have been removed,
they've been buffered out.

00:19:11.348 --> 00:19:15.410
Now there's been a lot of
speculation about why

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:20.263
canalization might evolve,
or whether it might just be a

00:19:20.263 --> 00:19:21.500
byproduct.
 

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:24.548
And frankly in most cases we
have no idea.

00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:27.130
This is an open research
question.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:32.064
So one of the reasons people
think that say whole organism

00:19:32.064 --> 00:19:34.394
traits,
like say five fingers or four

00:19:34.394 --> 00:19:36.769
limbs,
might be buffered is not

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:41.692
because of selection to buffer
those traits but because there

00:19:41.692 --> 00:19:45.118
are very,
very strong selection forces

00:19:45.118 --> 00:19:50.008
operating at the micro level
within cells on gene signaling

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:51.019
pathways.
 

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:54.555
So you buffer those,
and then as a byproduct of that

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:57.190
you get buffering at a higher
level.

00:19:57.190 --> 00:20:00.633
We don't know what's the case,
but we do know that

00:20:00.633 --> 00:20:04.710
canalization exists and we do
know it has a consequence;

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.650
it allows hidden genetic
variation to accumulate.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:11.779
So that's the fourth major
reason why there can be neutral

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:12.358
genes.
 

00:20:12.358 --> 00:20:19.558
Now, what causes random or
genetic drift?

00:20:19.558 --> 00:20:23.410
That will generate neutrality,
but then what happens to the

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.068
genes that are neutral?
 

00:20:25.068 --> 00:20:33.397
Well these are the mechanisms
that can introduce randomness

00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:36.634
into evolution;
most of them,

00:20:36.634 --> 00:20:38.650
there probably are a few
others.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.000
The first is mutation.
 

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.597
The second is the Mendelian
lottery, which is the idea that

00:20:44.597 --> 00:20:46.460
meiosis is like a fair coin.
 

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.980
Then we have some population
level effects.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.029
So mutation you can think of as
a molecular event.

00:20:54.029 --> 00:20:57.298
The Mendelian lottery is a
cellular event.

00:20:57.298 --> 00:21:00.614
Founder effects and genetic
bottlenecks are population

00:21:00.614 --> 00:21:01.240
effects.
 

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.144
And then we have a demographic
effect, which is variation in

00:21:05.144 --> 00:21:08.519
reproductive success in a
population of any size.

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:11.400
All of these things contribute
to random change.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.724
And now I want to step through
them and give you a more

00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.818
concrete feel for how they work.
 

00:21:16.818 --> 00:21:23.339
There are some senses in which
mutation is not random.

00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:25.298
Okay?
 

00:21:25.298 --> 00:21:30.558
Mutations occur at some sites
more frequently than others.

00:21:30.558 --> 00:21:35.098
In a pathogenic bacterium that
is encountering a challenging

00:21:35.098 --> 00:21:38.945
environment, it will up its
entire mutation rate by

00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:41.640
down-regulating its DNA repair.
 

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.104
It's a fairly simple thing to
increase the mutation rate on a

00:21:45.104 --> 00:21:45.970
whole genome.
 

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.619
You just neglect to repair it
and it will mutate faster.

00:21:49.619 --> 00:21:50.078
Okay?
 

00:21:50.078 --> 00:21:53.160
So if bacteria are moved into a
new environment or,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.335
for example,
if a pathogenic bacterium is

00:21:55.335 --> 00:21:58.326
put into a vertebrate with a
very active and threatening

00:21:58.326 --> 00:22:01.970
immune system,
it increases its mutation rate.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:10.238
The transitions between the
nucleotide classes--so purine to

00:22:10.238 --> 00:22:13.855
purine, pyrimidine to
pyrimidine--are more frequent

00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:15.519
than transversions.
 

00:22:15.519 --> 00:22:19.050
So purines will mutate to
purines more frequently than

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.450
purines will mutate to
pyrmidines.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:25.823
And mutations do not produce
random changes in phenotype

00:22:25.823 --> 00:22:26.460
space.
 

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.079
This one again is a little bit
abstract.

00:22:28.079 --> 00:22:29.048
Okay?
 

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:34.483
But a mutation can only cause a
change in the inherited set of

00:22:34.483 --> 00:22:35.910
possibilities.
 

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.279
There is very,
very little mutational variance

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:43.548
in the human population for a
sixth set of appendages,

00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:45.259
growing in the middle of our
backs,

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:47.140
that could be turned into the
wings of angels;

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:49.859
very little.
 

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:51.640
Okay?
 

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:58.240
There is very little mutational
variance in a clam for any organ

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.640
that could be involved in air
breathing.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:08.838
So mutations do not cover all
of conceivable phenotypic space.

00:23:08.838 --> 00:23:12.355
Mutations are only causing
perturbations in the inherited

00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:15.932
set of possibilities that a
given evolutionary lineage has

00:23:15.932 --> 00:23:16.750
produced.
 

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.160
So they're not making random
changes in phenotype space.

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:26.220
But they are random in an
extremely important sense.

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:29.249
There is no systematic
relationship between the

00:23:29.249 --> 00:23:33.332
phenotypic effect of a mutation
and the need of the organism in

00:23:33.332 --> 00:23:34.650
which it occurs.
 

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:36.930
They're random with respect to
fitness.

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.515
So when those bacteria are
going into the vertebrate immune

00:23:40.515 --> 00:23:43.914
systems and it would be
extremely convenient for them to

00:23:43.914 --> 00:23:47.438
have a mutation that was just
exactly the right thing that

00:23:47.438 --> 00:23:50.961
they needed to avoid that
particular defensive maneuver on

00:23:50.961 --> 00:23:54.539
the part of their host,
they don't get it.

00:23:54.539 --> 00:23:55.769
Okay?
 

00:23:55.769 --> 00:23:59.955
All nature will give them is
random mutations with respect to

00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:03.440
that particular function,
and then if they have a lot of

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.961
progeny,
one of them may have the right

00:24:07.961 --> 00:24:09.700
one by luck.
 

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.718
Similarly, in your case,
it might be extremely

00:24:12.718 --> 00:24:16.742
convenient for you to have an
adaptation which allowed you to

00:24:16.742 --> 00:24:21.036
look at a computer screen for 48
hours without getting a headache

00:24:21.036 --> 00:24:24.859
and without having to get up to
go to the bathroom.

00:24:24.859 --> 00:24:25.818
Okay?
 

00:24:25.818 --> 00:24:29.307
That mutation is not going to
happen, because you need that

00:24:29.307 --> 00:24:29.970
function.
 

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.838
Your genome is going to be
covered by random mutations,

00:24:33.838 --> 00:24:36.960
and it may very well be that
one of your children is able to

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.868
look at that screen a little bit
longer than you are.

00:24:39.868 --> 00:24:44.578
But that will be because it
happened at random,

00:24:44.578 --> 00:24:50.689
not because somehow development
or evolution could anticipate

00:24:50.689 --> 00:24:55.170
that that function was going to
be useful.

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:59.449
So the process of mutation
produces a lot of variation,

00:24:59.449 --> 00:25:03.252
and then natural selection
edits it, it sorts it,

00:25:03.252 --> 00:25:04.680
it screens it.
 

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.768
And at the point at which that
variation is produced,

00:25:09.768 --> 00:25:15.346
the potential function of the
variation is not a question,

00:25:15.346 --> 00:25:22.140
it's not an issue;
it's just making variations.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.568
Okay, second,
meiosis is like a fair coin.

00:25:26.568 --> 00:25:33.809
So this is something that you
may find boring.

00:25:33.809 --> 00:25:35.420
You've all heard about meiosis.
 

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.920
You've all heard about Mendel's
Laws.

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.895
You know that the probability
that a gamete will get into a

00:25:40.895 --> 00:25:45.490
particular--that a gene will get
into a particular gamete is 50%.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.411
And you're all familiar with
this because you know that the

00:25:49.411 --> 00:25:53.400
probability that a child will be
a boy or a girl is 50%,

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:57.509
and that's because at the sex
chromosomes,

00:25:57.509 --> 00:26:00.640
and at all the other
chromosomes that we have,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:04.003
the probability that the
chromosome will go one way or

00:26:04.003 --> 00:26:05.210
the other is 50%.
 

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:09.118
That is absolutely amazing.
 

00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:15.140
Why is it that my Y chromosomes
don't get 80% of the action?

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.088
Why is it 50%?
 

00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:22.559
There's actually something very
deep here.

00:26:27.778 --> 00:26:31.747
If you construct a system in
which every one of the

00:26:31.747 --> 00:26:36.666
potentially competing elements
has been forced to have the same

00:26:36.666 --> 00:26:39.965
chance,
those elements must then

00:26:39.965 --> 00:26:43.763
cooperate,
because the only way they can

00:26:43.763 --> 00:26:49.375
increase their own chances is by
increasing everybody else's as

00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:50.098
well.
 

00:26:50.098 --> 00:26:54.503
And that is why this particular
effect is called the parliament

00:26:54.503 --> 00:26:55.568
of the genes.
 

00:26:55.568 --> 00:27:00.739
It is a discovery that Nature,
about probably two billion

00:27:00.739 --> 00:27:04.048
years ago,
hit upon a principle that human

00:27:04.048 --> 00:27:06.904
political science didn't
discover until the

00:27:06.904 --> 00:27:10.238
Enlightenment,
which is that democracies are

00:27:10.238 --> 00:27:10.819
stable.
 

00:27:10.819 --> 00:27:14.538
Meiosis is a democracy.
 

00:27:14.538 --> 00:27:20.125
In meiosis each gene has a fair
chance, and that means that in a

00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:24.559
sense you've got a one-gene,
one-vote situation.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.913
So I'll come back--I'll come
back to this fairness of meiotic

00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:37.318
segregation, but there's a
general idea behind that.

00:27:37.318 --> 00:27:39.863
I've just given you a little
scenario that would suggest why

00:27:39.863 --> 00:27:43.224
it was selected;
it was selected to repress

00:27:43.224 --> 00:27:44.220
conflict.
 

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.630
Every other aspect of genetics
has evolved.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:52.690
So when you take genetics,
or you take cell biology,

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:56.460
or you take developmental
biology, there were--

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.500
there were selective processes
that produce what you study,

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.940
and there were alternatives
that were rejected,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:06.278
and you're looking only at a
sample of what nature can

00:28:06.278 --> 00:28:06.910
produce.
 

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:12.470
And that in itself becomes an
interesting research program.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.059
Okay, back to the parliament of
the genes.

00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:17.819
I referred to conflict.
 

00:28:17.819 --> 00:28:20.700
Here's the conflict.
 

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:23.108
There are things called meiotic
drivers.

00:28:23.108 --> 00:28:29.759
So there are genes which
actually change Mendel's Laws;

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:34.758
they change the probability
that they will get into the next

00:28:34.758 --> 00:28:35.858
generation.
 

00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:40.130
Anybody already heard how a
meiotic driver works?

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.930
It's kind of a cool system.
 

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:48.650
They use a long-range poison
and a short-range antidote.

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:54.135
So a meiotic driver usually
operates by killing off any cell

00:28:54.135 --> 00:28:58.601
that does not have a copy of
itself, of its gene,

00:28:58.601 --> 00:29:02.598
and giving an antidote to its
own cell.

00:29:02.598 --> 00:29:06.373
So as the cells sit there,
in the ovary or in the testes

00:29:06.373 --> 00:29:10.009
or in whatever organ that
particular organism has,

00:29:10.009 --> 00:29:12.490
the biotic drivers are
basically wiping out the

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.078
competition and promoting their
own interests.

00:29:15.078 --> 00:29:17.288
These things are all over the
place.

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:21.169
They are common in drosophila,
and there is evidence that

00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:24.910
there have been meiotic drivers
in the human genome.

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:28.430
Okay?
 

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:34.230
Once the diploid state evolved,
there was a long history of

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.944
invasion by meiotic drivers,
and the response to that is

00:29:39.944 --> 00:29:45.853
that all the other genes wanted
to cause these meiotic drivers

00:29:45.853 --> 00:29:47.210
to go away.
 

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.568
They were distorting their own
interests.

00:29:50.568 --> 00:29:54.150
You're sitting there on a
chromosome, you're innocent.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:57.615
Some wild bandit comes along
and highjacks your interests,

00:29:57.615 --> 00:30:01.203
and now your probability of
getting into the next generation

00:30:01.203 --> 00:30:03.150
is only 20% rather than 50%.
 

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.900
Who wants that, you know?
 

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.328
That's not a good deal.
 

00:30:06.328 --> 00:30:10.483
So throughout the genome
various mechanisms arose to

00:30:10.483 --> 00:30:14.851
repress meiotic drive;
and the result was a very

00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:19.288
complicated mechanism and we
call it meiosis.

00:30:19.288 --> 00:30:23.134
So that's not the only possible
reason for the complexity in

00:30:23.134 --> 00:30:24.569
fairness of meiosis.
 

00:30:24.569 --> 00:30:26.058
It is a plausible one.
 

00:30:26.058 --> 00:30:30.028
I invite you to consider the
cultural evolution of democracy

00:30:30.028 --> 00:30:34.268
and decide whether it too might
have been driven by a history of

00:30:34.268 --> 00:30:37.405
cheating,
particularly the defection of

00:30:37.405 --> 00:30:41.117
leaders who no longer
represented the interests of

00:30:41.117 --> 00:30:42.328
their people.
 

00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:46.952
I think there's a similarity,
and I think you'll find it

00:30:46.952 --> 00:30:51.068
articulated in the Declaration
of Independence.

00:30:51.068 --> 00:30:55.859
Okay, mechanisms that cause
random change also occur at the

00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:57.430
population level.
 

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:01.230
One of them is the founder
effect.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:10.810
Let's suppose that I were to
found a new population with only

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:13.170
you;
it would have a high

00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.990
probability of blue eyes.
 

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.880
And with you it would have a
high probability of brown eyes.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.839
And in order to choose you I
flipped a coin.

00:31:20.839 --> 00:31:22.778
Okay?
 

00:31:22.778 --> 00:31:26.101
At the founding of that
population there was a random

00:31:26.101 --> 00:31:29.567
event, which was just sampling;
just sampling a couple of

00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:31.578
individuals out of a big
population.

00:31:31.578 --> 00:31:35.690
And the result of this is that
there are certain diseases,

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.205
human genetic diseases,
that are rare in the human

00:31:38.205 --> 00:31:41.333
population in general,
but are common in populations

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:43.940
that were founded by just a few
people,

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.440
including Tay-Sachs disease in
Quebec,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.710
porphyria in the Afrikaners of
the Cape,

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.068
and diabetes in Pitcairn Island.
 

00:31:53.068 --> 00:31:55.939
So you just take a little
sample out of a big population

00:31:55.939 --> 00:31:58.598
and you get something that's not
representative,

00:31:58.598 --> 00:32:02.598
and sometimes that contains a
genetic disease.

00:32:02.598 --> 00:32:06.402
Another population level
phenomenon that yields

00:32:06.402 --> 00:32:08.798
randomness is a bottleneck.
 

00:32:08.798 --> 00:32:12.579
So that will happen when a
population crashes to a very,

00:32:12.579 --> 00:32:15.535
very small size,
and then only a few alleles

00:32:15.535 --> 00:32:16.910
make it through.
 

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.794
So you might have a lot of
versions of a gene in a big

00:32:20.794 --> 00:32:23.452
population,
but if you're only founding a

00:32:23.452 --> 00:32:26.098
new population with two or three
individuals,

00:32:26.098 --> 00:32:29.657
they're--and they're diploid,
well two individuals only carry

00:32:29.657 --> 00:32:31.200
four copies of the gene.
 

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.855
So if there had been twenty
alleles in the original

00:32:33.855 --> 00:32:37.096
population, the maximum possible
number that could get through

00:32:37.096 --> 00:32:40.710
that bottleneck is only four;
you've left behind sixteen.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:43.920
It appears that this is what
happened with the cheetahs.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.615
And they are apparently almost
completely homozygous,

00:32:47.615 --> 00:32:51.170
particularly with respect to
their immune genes.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.984
It is a weird biological fact
that you can take a skin graft

00:32:54.984 --> 00:32:58.088
off of one cheetah and graft it
to a cheetah,

00:32:58.088 --> 00:33:01.720
any other cheetah in the world,
and the graft will take.

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:05.239
In other words,
their immune system finds a

00:33:05.239 --> 00:33:10.349
sample of skin from any other
cheetah in the world to be their

00:33:10.349 --> 00:33:11.440
own skin.
 

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.259
They don't detect a difference.
 

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:17.913
And that probably is a signal
that cheetahs went through a

00:33:17.913 --> 00:33:22.813
very small population bottleneck
within the last few thousand

00:33:22.813 --> 00:33:23.630
years.
 

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:30.269
Genetic drift is then a
consequence of neutrality.

00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:34.615
It's the random wandering of
the frequencies of neutral

00:33:34.615 --> 00:33:35.259
genes.
 

00:33:35.259 --> 00:33:38.194
If you look through a
microscope, Brownian motion is

00:33:38.194 --> 00:33:41.419
the jiggling of little dust
particles that you see in the

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:44.493
microscope,
and it is actually the result

00:33:44.493 --> 00:33:48.728
of the random impacts of water
molecules hitting that dust

00:33:48.728 --> 00:33:49.618
particle.
 

00:33:49.618 --> 00:33:54.830
Well the population level
analog of heat in water is

00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:59.226
variation in population
size--uh, excuse me,

00:33:59.226 --> 00:34:02.190
variation in family size.
 

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:07.483
A gene which has gone through
the Mendelian lottery of meiosis

00:34:07.483 --> 00:34:09.219
lands in a zygote.
 

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.019
Okay?
 

00:34:10.019 --> 00:34:11.090
It got into the zygote.
 

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:12.510
The zygote grows up.
 

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:15.329
This particular gene is neutral.
 

00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:18.630
It's not making any difference
to reproductive success.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:23.670
But that particular individual
that it landed in could have a

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.985
small family or a big family,
for reasons that have nothing

00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:30.059
to do with the function of the
gene.

00:34:30.059 --> 00:34:33.625
It's just a flip of the coin
that determines whether it will

00:34:33.625 --> 00:34:37.009
be in a family that produces two
children, zero children,

00:34:37.009 --> 00:34:38.519
or a lot of children.
 

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:40.949
Okay?
 

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.483
So that's what I mean by
combining the lottery of meiosis

00:34:44.483 --> 00:34:47.070
with variation in reproductive
success.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.599
And this is a process that goes
on in all populations.

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:54.239
When people are first learning
about genetic drift,

00:34:54.239 --> 00:34:56.106
they think oh,
that's something that happens

00:34:56.106 --> 00:34:58.788
in small populations,
because small populations don't

00:34:58.788 --> 00:35:01.960
have all the smoothing effects
of the Law of Large Numbers.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:08.050
But this will happen in a
population of any size.

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:09.409
Okay?
 

00:35:09.409 --> 00:35:13.827
And basically what I mean by
that is this interesting

00:35:13.827 --> 00:35:18.159
consequence of variation in
reproductive success.

00:35:18.159 --> 00:35:22.340
If it's correlated with a trait
or with a gene,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:26.159
strongly, it produces natural
selection.

00:35:26.159 --> 00:35:28.750
If it's not correlated it
produces drift.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:35.898
So one of the real puzzles of
evolution has to do with what

00:35:35.898 --> 00:35:42.800
causes a gene to end up at
random in an individual making

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.836
one,
two or three,

00:35:44.836 --> 00:35:48.650
or zero recruits per lifetime;
what makes the difference

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:51.210
between an adaptive and a
neutral gene.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.119
I've sketched four possible
answers to that question.

00:35:55.119 --> 00:36:00.987
In any particular case we
normally do not know exactly

00:36:00.987 --> 00:36:05.969
which one is contributing the
most to that.

00:36:05.969 --> 00:36:12.269
So, what is it that happens to
neutral alleles?

00:36:17.768 --> 00:36:21.699
&lt;&lt;That's not going to
work.

00:36:21.699 --> 00:36:26.510
I'll just have to draw over
this.&gt;&gt;

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:33.521
If we draw time on the X-axis,
and we draw frequency on the

00:36:33.521 --> 00:36:36.376
Y-axis,
and a mutation occurs,

00:36:36.376 --> 00:36:40.570
the usual thing that will
happen to a mutation is it will

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:43.489
increase a little bit and
disappear.

00:36:43.489 --> 00:36:46.789
Then we wait for awhile,
another mutation occurs.

00:36:46.789 --> 00:36:49.237
We're looking,
by the way, across many

00:36:49.237 --> 00:36:51.619
different genes in the
population.

00:36:51.619 --> 00:36:54.239
We wait awhile,
another mutation occurs.

00:36:54.239 --> 00:36:56.309
It comes into the population.
 

00:36:56.309 --> 00:37:01.369
The probability that it will
ever get fixed is pretty low

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:06.699
because the probability is
proportional to the frequency;

00:37:06.699 --> 00:37:13.000
excuse me, is proportional to
1/N, frequency equal to 1/N.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.594
When it's rare,
its frequency is very low and

00:37:15.594 --> 00:37:18.130
so its probability of being
fixed is low.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:25.391
But once in awhile a mutation
comes along that manages to go

00:37:25.391 --> 00:37:31.809
through all of this drift,
and making it through organisms

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:35.188
that had,
on average, more than two

00:37:35.188 --> 00:37:38.900
progeny per lifetime,
and it gets fixed.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:45.369
And if you just look at this
class of mutations,

00:37:45.369 --> 00:37:53.077
the time that it takes them to
fix is proportional to the

00:37:53.077 --> 00:37:55.829
population size.
 

00:37:55.829 --> 00:38:00.099
So things will get fixed faster
in small populations than they

00:38:00.099 --> 00:38:01.429
will in big ones.
 

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:04.635
There will be more of them,
more mutations will occur in a

00:38:04.635 --> 00:38:07.222
big population,
but it will take them longer to

00:38:07.222 --> 00:38:08.010
get fixed.
 

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:13.346
Now because the bigger
populations have more mutations,

00:38:13.346 --> 00:38:18.780
it turns out that their size
exactly compensates for the

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.349
longer fixation times.
 

00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:24.768
So if you're just counting how
many get fixed--

00:38:24.768 --> 00:38:28.235
it doesn't matter whether
you're in a small population or

00:38:28.235 --> 00:38:30.876
a big one--
the same number of mutations

00:38:30.876 --> 00:38:33.039
are getting fixed in both cases.
 

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:37.268
That means that over the course
of evolutionary history

00:38:37.268 --> 00:38:41.969
populations could've gone
through crashes and explosions,

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:46.146
and at the end of it,
if you're a geneticist studying

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:47.851
the DNA,
looking back,

00:38:47.851 --> 00:38:51.777
it doesn't make any difference
that the populations had crashes

00:38:51.777 --> 00:38:54.922
and explosions,
in terms of how many neutral

00:38:54.922 --> 00:38:56.239
alleles got fixed.
 

00:38:56.239 --> 00:39:00.639
They were just getting steadily
fixed, with no effect of

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:02.079
population size.
 

00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:05.630
So we don't know which one will
be fixed.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.699
We do know how many will be
fixed.

00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:12.900
So this is why the molecular
clock is like an atomic clock;

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.929
it's driven by radioactive
decay.

00:39:15.929 --> 00:39:20.257
We don't know how many
atoms--we don't know which atom

00:39:20.257 --> 00:39:24.257
will decay, but in a second we
know how many will,

00:39:24.257 --> 00:39:27.360
for a given radioactive
substance.

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.021
The reason for this is that
there's regularity in large

00:39:31.021 --> 00:39:31.699
numbers.
 

00:39:31.699 --> 00:39:35.809
It emerges because there are a
large number of independent

00:39:35.809 --> 00:39:36.460
events.
 

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.860
Our haploid genome has about
three billion base pairs.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.389
One mole of uranium has about 6
times 10^(23) atoms--

00:39:45.389 --> 00:39:49.340
actually if it's a mole it has
exactly that many atoms--

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.090
and these large numbers give
the regularity to the process.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.715
Okay, so this is what connects
microevolution to

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:06.840
macroevolution.
 

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:13.681
It creates uniform substitution
rates in neutral portions of the

00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:14.659
genome.
 

00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:19.240
And this is the assumption that
molecular evolution makes when

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.869
it reconstructs the Tree of
Life.

00:40:21.869 --> 00:40:26.347
It allows us to estimate branch
lengths and branch points to

00:40:26.347 --> 00:40:28.170
last common ancestors.
 

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:31.429
It allows us to make
comparative inferences on

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:32.949
phylogenetic trees.
 

00:40:32.949 --> 00:40:38.731
And therefore neutral evolution
is a actually a central tool in

00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:43.300
the construction of the
evolutionary framework.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.969
It's not something to be
neglected;

00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:50.478
it's something to be
understood, because it gives us

00:40:50.478 --> 00:40:55.960
a source of regularity that can
take us back into deep time.

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:59.125
As an example,
here are nucleotide

00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:02.289
substitutions occurring in flu.
 

00:41:02.289 --> 00:41:05.239
These are isolates that are
still in the freezer.

00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:06.380
Okay?
 

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:10.170
And they run here from about
1925 up to 1990.

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:13.150
We don't have any,
any error of estimate in age;

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.000
we know when they were isolated.
 

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.750
Okay?
 

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.599
The population sizes have
fluctuated dramatically.

00:41:18.599 --> 00:41:21.074
At some point,
some of these flu strains were

00:41:21.074 --> 00:41:24.170
sitting in a few ducks or pigs
in southeastern China.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.438
At other points,
they were inhabiting a billion

00:41:26.438 --> 00:41:27.719
people around the world.
 

00:41:27.719 --> 00:41:30.436
They went through huge
fluctuations,

00:41:30.436 --> 00:41:33.619
and a nice steady rate of
substitution.

00:41:33.619 --> 00:41:34.840
Okay?
 

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:37.739
All the mechanisms of genetic
drift are in play here,

00:41:37.739 --> 00:41:39.860
except meiosis,
because flu is a virus,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.590
doesn't go through meiosis.
 

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:45.440
The effect of variation in
population size was exactly

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:49.583
compensated by the much slower
rate of fixation of neutral

00:41:49.583 --> 00:41:52.199
mutations in larger populations.
 

00:41:52.199 --> 00:41:56.762
So even in an epidemic disease,
like flu, the molecular clock

00:41:56.762 --> 00:41:58.360
is nice and steady.
 

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.610
A few caveats about that.
 

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.740
Different proteins and
different parts of proteins

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.960
evolve at different rates.
 

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.739
They only use non-transcribed
DNA sequences.

00:42:08.739 --> 00:42:12.034
There are some differences
among lineages because of

00:42:12.034 --> 00:42:13.909
different generation times.
 

00:42:13.909 --> 00:42:17.351
And I'm not going to talk about
maladaptation because I took too

00:42:17.351 --> 00:42:19.099
long to talk about neutrality.
 

00:42:19.099 --> 00:42:21.927
So you can read about
maladaptation,

00:42:21.927 --> 00:42:25.159
and I'll just give you the
basic idea.

00:42:25.159 --> 00:42:27.780
Here's the basic idea of
maladaptation.

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.005
If natural selection is strong
in one place and organisms get

00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:38.315
really well adapted to it,
but they move to another place,

00:42:38.315 --> 00:42:43.320
where they don't do well,
for whatever reason,

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.001
we call the place that is
producing an excess of organisms

00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:50.351
the source,
and the place which is not good

00:42:50.351 --> 00:42:52.349
for the organisms a sink.
 

00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:56.105
The genes in the sink represent
organisms usually that were

00:42:56.105 --> 00:42:57.659
adapted to the source.
 

00:42:57.659 --> 00:43:01.646
So if organisms get well
adapted in one place and moved

00:43:01.646 --> 00:43:04.380
to another that's quite
different,

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.518
and they never get an
opportunity to come into

00:43:06.518 --> 00:43:08.800
evolutionary equilibrium with
that new place,

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.677
which we call the sink,
then they are maladapted to the

00:43:11.677 --> 00:43:12.050
sink.
 

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:16.429
That is the basic idea behind
how maladaptation can occur.

00:43:16.429 --> 00:43:18.119
Okay?
 

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:23.860
So, let me jump ahead.
 

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:31.114
I will just run quickly through
these examples and get to the

00:43:31.114 --> 00:43:37.280
end, just to let you know what
happens next time.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.309
These are the keys I want you
to remember.

00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:44.565
I want you to remember how it
is that meiosis is like a fair

00:43:44.565 --> 00:43:45.070
coin.
 

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.338
I want you to remember how the
fixation of a neutral allele is

00:43:48.338 --> 00:43:49.679
like radioactive decay.
 

00:43:49.679 --> 00:43:53.820
And I want you to remember that
the regular fixation of neutral

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.829
alleles generates a molecular
clock that allows us to connect

00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:59.699
micro to macroevolution.
 

00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:02.099
Okay, that's it.

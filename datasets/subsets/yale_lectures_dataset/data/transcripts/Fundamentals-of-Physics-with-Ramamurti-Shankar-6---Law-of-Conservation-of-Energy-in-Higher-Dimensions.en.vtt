00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.806
If you've got a function
f(x), you know the value

00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:07.023
at some point,
and you want to go to a

00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:10.020
neighboring point,
a distance Δx away.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.690
You ask, "How much does the
function change?"

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.884
And the answer is,
the change in the function

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:22.507
Δf is the derivative of
the function at the starting

00:00:22.507 --> 00:00:26.130
point times the distance you
move.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.406
This is not an equality,
unless f happens to be a

00:00:29.406 --> 00:00:32.103
straight line;
it's an approximation and there

00:00:32.103 --> 00:00:35.440
are corrections to this.
That's what all the dots mean;

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.574
corrections are proportional to
Δx^(2) and

00:00:37.574 --> 00:00:40.911
Δx^(3) and so on.
But if Δx is tiny this

00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:42.910
will do;
that's it.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.196
But today, we are going to move
the whole Work Energy Theorem

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:51.340
and the Law of Conservation of
Energy to two dimensions.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.728
So, when you go to two
dimensions, you've got to ask

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:57.120
yourself, "What am I looking
for?"

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.046
Well, in the end,
I'm hoping I will get some

00:01:00.046 --> 00:01:04.332
relation like K_1 +
U_1 = K_2 +

00:01:04.332 --> 00:01:07.849
U_2,
assuming there is no friction.

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.500
U_2 is going
to be my new potential energy.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.440
Then, if it's the potential
energy and the particle is

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.381
moving in two dimensions,
it's got to be a function of

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.430
two variables,
x and y.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.294
So, I have to make sure that
you guys know enough about

00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:26.310
functions of more than one
variable.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.495
So, this is,
again, a crash course on

00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.620
reminding you of the main
points.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.131
There are not that many.
By the time I get here I'll be

00:01:34.131 --> 00:01:36.525
done.
So, how do you visualize the

00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:39.670
function of two variables?
The function of one variable,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.172
you know, you plot x
this way and the function along

00:01:42.172 --> 00:01:44.241
y.
If it's two variables,

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:48.191
you plot x here and
y here and the function

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:52.564
itself is shown by drawing some
surface on top of the xy

00:01:52.564 --> 00:01:55.078
plane,
so that if you take a point and

00:01:55.078 --> 00:01:58.667
you go right up till you hit the
surface, that's the value of the

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.079
function,
at that point xy.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.627
It's like a canopy on top of
the xy plane and how high

00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.280
you've got to go is the
function.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.144
For example,
starting with the floor,

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:13.200
I can ask how high you have to
go till I hit the ceiling.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.911
That function varies;
there are dents and dimples and

00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:19.970
so on, so the function varies
with xy.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.802
Another example of a function
of x and

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:24.218
y--x and y
could be coordinates in the

00:02:24.218 --> 00:02:26.800
United States and the function
could be the temperature at that

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.042
point.
So, you plot it on top of that,

00:02:29.042 --> 00:02:31.909
each point you plot the
temperature at that point.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:35.388
So, once you've got the notion
of a function of two variables,

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:38.924
if you're going to do calculus
the next thing is what about the

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:42.060
derivatives of the function.
How does it change?

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.440
Well, in the old days,
it was dependent on x

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.767
and I changed the x and I
found the change in the function

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:53.486
divided by the change in
x and took the limit and

00:02:53.486 --> 00:02:57.386
that became my derivative.
And now, I'm sitting in the

00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:00.408
xy plane,
so here is x and here is

00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:02.534
y;
I'm here, the function is

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:05.767
coming out of the blackboard.
So, imagine something measured

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:09.318
out but I'm sitting here.
Now, I want to move and ask how

00:03:09.318 --> 00:03:12.590
the function changes.
But now I have a lot of options;

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.379
in fact, an infinite number of
options.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.510
I can move along x,
I can move along y,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.150
I can move at some intermediate
angle,

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.953
we have to ask what do you want
me to do when it comes time to

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.380
take derivatives.
So, it turns out,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.951
and you will see it proven
amply as we go along,

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.741
that you just have to think
about derivatives on two

00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:33.914
principle directions which I
will choose to be x and

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:36.720
y.
So, we're going to define one

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.449
derivative, which is defined as
follows.

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.734
You start at the point
xy, you go to the point

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:46.441
x + Δx,
the same y and subtract

00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:50.750
the function at the starting
point, divide by Δx and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.150
take all the limits,
Δx goes to 0.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.695
That means you go from here to
here, you move a distance

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:00.854
Δx, you'd find the
change in the function,

00:04:00.854 --> 00:04:04.406
you take the derivative.
As you move horizontally,

00:04:04.406 --> 00:04:07.620
you notice you don't do
anything to y;

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.590
y will be left fixed at
whatever y you had;

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.130
x will be changed by
Δx;

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.557
you find the change;
you take the derivative and

00:04:15.557 --> 00:04:17.050
take the limit that is denoted
by the symbol df/dx.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.098
[Reader note:
Partial derivatives will be

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:19.670
written as ordinary derivatives
to avoid using fonts that may

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.137
not be universally available.
It should be clear from the

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:22.709
context that a partial
derivative is intended here,

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:24.509
since f depends on
x and y.]

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.797
So, this curly d instead
of the straight d tells

00:04:26.797 --> 00:04:28.410
you it's called a "partial
derivative."

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.315
Some people may want to make it
very explicit by saying this is

00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:38.220
the derivative with subscript
y.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.977
That means y is being
held constant when x is

00:04:40.977 --> 00:04:43.829
varied, but we don't have to
write that because we know we've

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:46.161
got two coordinates.
If I'm changing one,

00:04:46.161 --> 00:04:49.140
the other guy is y so we
won't write that;

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.464
that's the partial derivative.
So, you can also move from here

00:04:54.464 --> 00:04:57.779
to here, up and down,
and see how the function

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.487
changes.
I won't write the details,

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:03.480
you can define obviously a
df/dy.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.395
So, one tells you how the
function changes,

00:05:07.395 --> 00:05:11.589
with x I should move
along x,

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:13.951
and the other tells you how it
changes at y as you move

00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:16.579
along y.
Let's get some practice.

00:05:16.579 --> 00:05:20.613
So, I'm going to write some
function, f = x^(3)y^(2),

00:05:20.613 --> 00:05:23.689
that's a function of x
and y.

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.902
You can write any--let's make
it a little more interesting,

00:05:26.902 --> 00:05:28.730
plus y,
or y^(2);

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.810
that's some function of
x and y.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.701
So, when I say df/dx,
the rule is find out how it

00:05:37.701 --> 00:05:42.060
varies with x keeping
y constant.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.421
That means, really treat it
like a constant,

00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:47.770
because number five--What will
you do if y was equal to

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.761
5?
This'll be 25 and it's not part

00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:52.281
of taking derivatives because
it's not changing,

00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:55.389
and here it'll be just standing
in front doing nothing;

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.068
it will just take the x
derivative, treating y as

00:05:58.068 --> 00:06:00.019
a constant.
You're supposed to do that here;

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.839
this is a derivative
3x^(2)y;

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:05.769
so that's the x
derivative.

00:06:05.769 --> 00:06:10.387
Now, you can take the y
part, y^(2),

00:06:10.387 --> 00:06:14.904
yes, thank you.
Then, I can take df/dy,

00:06:14.904 --> 00:06:20.637
so then I look for y
changes, this is 2y here,

00:06:20.637 --> 00:06:24.329
so it's 2x^(3)y +
2y;

00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:27.463
so that's the x
derivative and the partial

00:06:27.463 --> 00:06:31.918
y derivative.
Okay, so then you can now take

00:06:31.918 --> 00:06:35.347
higher derivatives.
We know that from calculus and

00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:37.379
one variable,
you can take the derivative of

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.533
the derivative.
So, one thing you can think

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:45.312
about is d^(2)f/dx^(2),
that really means take the

00:06:45.312 --> 00:06:49.920
d by dx of the
d by dx.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.435
That's what it means.
First, take a derivative and

00:06:52.435 --> 00:06:54.240
take the derivative of the
derivative.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.990
So, let's see what I get here.
I already took df/dx.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.563
I want to take its derivative,
right, the derivative of

00:07:01.563 --> 00:07:05.070
x^(2) is 2x,
so I get 6xy^(2).

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:13.506
Then, I can take the y
derivative of the y

00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:16.120
derivative,
d^(2)f/dy^(2),

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.850
that's d by dy of
df/dy,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.579
if you take the y
derivative there.

00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:22.920
You guys should keep an eye out
for me when I do this.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.532
I get this.
But now, we have an interesting

00:07:28.532 --> 00:07:31.339
possibility you didn't have in
one dimension,

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:37.073
which is to take the x
derivative of the y

00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:42.597
derivative, so I want to take
d by dx of

00:07:42.597 --> 00:07:46.956
df/dy.
That is written as

00:07:46.956 --> 00:07:51.740
d^(2)f/dxdy.
Let's see what I get.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.162
So, I want the x
derivative of the y

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:58.227
derivative.
So, I go to this guy and take

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:02.319
his x derivative,
I get 3x^(2) from there,

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:05.370
so I get 6x^(2)y and
that's it.

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:13.757
So, make sure that I got the
proper x derivative of

00:08:13.757 --> 00:08:19.425
this, I think that's fine.
Then, I can also take

00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:24.397
d^(2)f/dydx.
That means, take the y

00:08:24.397 --> 00:08:27.567
derivative of the x
derivative, but here's the

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:30.675
x derivative,
take the y derivative of

00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:33.700
that, put a 2y there,
and I get 6x^(2)y.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.169
So, you're supposed to notice
something.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.730
If you already know this,
you're not surprised.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:48.335
If you've never seen this
before, you will notice that the

00:08:48.335 --> 00:08:51.448
cross derivative,
y followed by x

00:08:51.448 --> 00:08:54.279
and x followed by
y, will come up being

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:57.776
equal.
That's a general property of

00:08:57.776 --> 00:09:01.389
any reasonable function.
By reasonable,

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:05.107
I mean you cannot call the
mathematicians to help because

00:09:05.107 --> 00:09:08.626
they will always find something
where this won't work,

00:09:08.626 --> 00:09:10.477
okay?
But if you write down any

00:09:10.477 --> 00:09:13.281
function that you are capable of
writing down with powers of

00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:15.990
x and powers of y
and sines and cosines,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.158
it'll always be true that you
could take the cross derivatives

00:09:19.158 --> 00:09:21.340
in either order and get the same
answer.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.160
I'd like to give a little bit
of a feeling for why that is

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:27.731
true;
it's true but it's helpful to

00:09:27.731 --> 00:09:31.084
know why it's true.
So, let's ask the following

00:09:31.084 --> 00:09:35.700
question.
Let's take a function and let's

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:42.259
ask how much the function
changes when I go from some

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:46.681
point x,
y to another point

00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:50.639
x + Δx,
y + Δy.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.159
I want to find the change in
the function.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:59.530
So, I'm asking you what is
f(x + Δx,

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:07.104
y + Δy) - f(x,y) for small
values of Δx and

00:10:07.104 --> 00:10:10.582
Δy.
For neighboring points,

00:10:10.582 --> 00:10:14.071
what's the change?
So, we're going to do it in two

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.975
stages.
We introduce an intermediate

00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:22.080
point here, whose coordinate is
x + Δ x and y,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.912
and I'm going to add and
subtract the value of the

00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:30.629
function here.
Adding and subtracting is free;

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:32.620
it doesn't cost anything,
so let's do that.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:39.871
Then, what do I get?
I get f(x + Δx,

00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:51.968
y + Δy ) - f(x + Δx,
y) + f(x + Δx,

00:10:51.968 --> 00:10:58.180
y) - f(x,y).

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.043
I'm just saying,
the change of that guy minus

00:11:06.043 --> 00:11:10.010
this guy is the same as that
minus this, plus this minus

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.960
that;
that's a trivial substitution.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.910
But I write it this way because
I look at the first entity here,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.289
it looks like I'm just changing
y.

00:11:21.289 --> 00:11:25.700
I'm not changing x,
you agree?

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:30.019
So what will this be?
This is going to be the rate of

00:11:30.019 --> 00:11:34.313
change of the function with
respect to x times

00:11:34.313 --> 00:11:36.788
Δx,
and this--I'm sorry,

00:11:36.788 --> 00:11:39.756
I got it wrong,
with respect to y times

00:11:39.756 --> 00:11:40.680
Δy.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.759
This one is df/dx times
Δx.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:12:02.691
Therefore, the change in the
function, if I add it all up,

00:12:02.691 --> 00:12:07.840
I get df/dx Δx + df/dy
Δy.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.799
But if you are pedantic,
you will notice there is

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:15.759
something I have to be a little
careful about.

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:20.438
What do you think I'm referring
to, in my notation,

00:12:20.438 --> 00:12:22.376
yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:12:22.376 --> 00:12:24.669
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Meaning?

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:27.456
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:30.072
Shankar: Oh,
but this is nothing to do with

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:32.743
dimension, you see.
It's one number minus another

00:12:32.743 --> 00:12:35.693
number.
I put another number in between

00:12:35.693 --> 00:12:43.379
and in this function;
it's a function only of here.

00:12:43.379 --> 00:12:46.412
Let me see, x is not
changing at all and y is

00:12:46.412 --> 00:12:48.400
changing, so it is df/dy
Δy.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.171
I meant something else.
That is, in fact,

00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:54.240
a good approximation but there
is one thing you should be

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.473
careful about which has to do
with where the derivatives are

00:12:57.473 --> 00:13:00.341
really taken.
For the term here,

00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:03.267
f(x + Δx,
y) - f(xy),

00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:08.179
I took the derivative,
at my starting point.

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:10.310
If you want,
I will say at the starting

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.147
point xy.
The second one,

00:13:12.147 --> 00:13:15.070
when I came here and I want to
move up, I'm taking the

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.159
derivative with respect to
y at the new point.

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:23.191
The new point is (x + Δx,
y), so derivatives are not

00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:29.040
quite taken at the same point.
So, you've got to fix that.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.898
And how do you fix that part?
You argue that the derivative

00:13:32.898 --> 00:13:36.870
with respect to y is just
another function of y;

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:39.007
f is a function of
x and y,

00:13:39.007 --> 00:13:41.600
its derivatives are functions
of x and y.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.025
Everything is a function of
x and y,

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:46.649
and we are saying this
derivative has been computed at

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:50.667
x + Δx,
instead of x,

00:13:50.667 --> 00:13:58.360
so it is going to be
df/dy at xy +

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:03.899
d^(2)f/dxdy times
Δx.

00:14:03.899 --> 00:14:06.025
In other words,
I am saying the derivative at

00:14:06.025 --> 00:14:08.490
this location is the derivative
at that location,

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.515
plus the rate of change of the
derivative times the change in

00:14:11.515 --> 00:14:13.236
x.
In other words,

00:14:13.236 --> 00:14:15.960
the derivative itself is
changing.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:22.806
So, if you put that together
you find it is df/dx Δx +

00:14:22.806 --> 00:14:27.971
df/dy Δy,
where if I don't put any bars

00:14:27.971 --> 00:14:33.856
or anything it means at the
starting point xy +

00:14:33.856 --> 00:14:37.700
(d^(2)f/dxdy) Δx Δy.

00:14:43.769 --> 00:14:47.912
Now, you've got to realize that
when you're doing these calculus

00:14:47.912 --> 00:14:51.331
problems, Δx is a tiny number,
Δy is a tiny number,

00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:54.055
Δx Δy is tiny times tiny.
So normally,

00:14:54.055 --> 00:14:56.795
we don't care about it,
or if you want to be more

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:59.649
accurate, of course,
you should keep that term.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:02.421
In the first approximation,
where you work to the first

00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:05.090
power of everything,
this will be your Δf.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.393
But if you're a little more
ambitious but you keep track of

00:15:08.393 --> 00:15:11.867
the fact the derivative itself
is changing, you will keep that

00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:15.012
term.
But another person comes along

00:15:15.012 --> 00:15:19.399
and says, "You know what,
I want to go like this.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:23.352
I want to introduce as my new
point, intermediate point,

00:15:23.352 --> 00:15:25.777
the one here.
It had a different value of

00:15:25.777 --> 00:15:28.623
y in the same x
and then I went horizontally

00:15:28.623 --> 00:15:30.470
when I keep track of the
changes."

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.298
What do you think that person
will calculate for the change in

00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:37.641
the function?
That person will get exactly

00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:42.702
this part, but the extra term
that person will get will look

00:15:42.702 --> 00:15:46.820
like d^(2)f/dydx times
Δy Δx.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.015
If you just do the whole thing
in your head,

00:15:52.015 --> 00:15:54.465
you can see that I'm just
exchanging the x and

00:15:54.465 --> 00:15:56.524
y roles.
So, everything that happened

00:15:56.524 --> 00:15:58.810
with x and y here
will come backwards with

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.181
y and x.
But then, the change between

00:16:01.181 --> 00:16:04.083
these two points is the change
between these two points and it

00:16:04.083 --> 00:16:06.699
doesn't matter whether I
introduce an intermediate point

00:16:06.699 --> 00:16:08.649
here or an intermediate point
there;

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:10.730
therefore, these changes have
to be equal.

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:15.131
This part is of course equal;
therefore, you want that part

00:16:15.131 --> 00:16:18.700
to be equal, Δx Δy is
clearly Δy Δx,

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:23.049
so the consequence of that is
d^(2)f/dxdy =

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:28.463
d^(2)f/dydx and that's
the reason it turns out when you

00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:32.990
take cross derivatives you get
the same answer.

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:35.452
It comes from the fact -- if
you say, where is that result

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:37.179
coming from -- it comes from the
fact,

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:40.827
if you start at some point and
you go to another point and you

00:16:40.827 --> 00:16:43.039
ask for the change in the
function,

00:16:43.039 --> 00:16:45.120
the change is accumulating as
you move.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.821
You can move horizontally and
then vertically,

00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:48.750
or you can move vertically and
then horizontally.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.980
The change in the function is a
change in the function.

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.010
You've got to get the same
answer both ways.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.794
That's the reason;
that's the requirement that

00:16:55.794 --> 00:16:59.649
leads to this requirement.
Now, I will not be keeping

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:04.364
track of functions to this
accuracy in everything we do

00:17:04.364 --> 00:17:06.722
today.
We'll be keeping the leading

00:17:06.722 --> 00:17:08.799
powers in Δx and
Δy.

00:17:08.799 --> 00:17:12.422
So, you should bear in mind
that if you make a movement in

00:17:12.422 --> 00:17:15.416
the xy plane,
which is Δx

00:17:15.416 --> 00:17:20.207
horizontally and Δy
vertically, then the change in

00:17:20.207 --> 00:17:24.829
the function is this [df/dx
Δx + df/dy Δy].

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:27.434
Draw a box around that,
because that's going to

00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:30.718
be--This is just the naive
generalization to two dimensions

00:17:30.718 --> 00:17:32.869
of what you know in one
dimension.

00:17:32.869 --> 00:17:34.783
We were saying look,
the function is changing

00:17:34.783 --> 00:17:37.130
because the independent
variables x and y

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:39.489
are changing,
and the change in the function

00:17:39.489 --> 00:17:42.349
is one part, which I blame on
the changing x,

00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:44.487
and a second part,
which I blame on the changing

00:17:44.487 --> 00:17:47.176
y and I add them.
So, you're worried about the

00:17:47.176 --> 00:17:50.349
fact that we're moving in the
plane and there are vectors.

00:17:50.349 --> 00:17:53.321
That's all correct,
but f is not a vector,

00:17:53.321 --> 00:17:56.972
f is just a number and
this change has got two parts,

00:17:56.972 --> 00:18:00.418
okay.
So, this is basically all the

00:18:00.418 --> 00:18:05.400
math we will need to do,
what I want to do today.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.407
So, let's now go back to our
original goal,

00:18:09.407 --> 00:18:15.131
which was to derive something
like the Law of Conservation of

00:18:15.131 --> 00:18:19.329
Energy in two dimensions instead
of one.

00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:22.769
You remember what I did last
time so I will remind you one

00:18:22.769 --> 00:18:27.159
more time what the trick was.
We found out that the change in

00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:31.872
the kinetic energy of some
object is equal to the work done

00:18:31.872 --> 00:18:35.693
by a force,
which was some F times

00:18:35.693 --> 00:18:40.874
Δx and then if you add
all the changes over a not

00:18:40.874 --> 00:18:44.987
infinitesimal displacement,
but a macroscopic displacement,

00:18:44.987 --> 00:18:47.618
that was given by integral of
F times dx and the

00:18:47.618 --> 00:18:49.343
integral of F times
dx from

00:18:49.343 --> 00:18:51.500
x_1 to
x_2.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.358
If F is a function only
of x, from the rules of

00:18:54.358 --> 00:18:57.073
calculus, the integral can be
written as a difference of a

00:18:57.073 --> 00:18:59.170
function at this limit minus
that limit,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.140
and that was
U(x_1) -

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.819
U(x_2),
where U is that function

00:19:06.819 --> 00:19:11.410
whose derivative with a minus
sign is F.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:16.195
That's what we did.
Then, it's very simple now to

00:19:16.195 --> 00:19:19.019
take the U_1 to
the left-hand side.

00:19:19.019 --> 00:19:20.633
Let me see,
K_1 to the

00:19:20.633 --> 00:19:22.713
right-hand side and
U(x_2) to the

00:19:22.713 --> 00:19:24.577
left-hand side,
to get K_2 +

00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:27.240
U_2 = K_1 +
U_1 and that's the

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.825
conservation of energy.
You want to try the same thing

00:19:30.825 --> 00:19:34.009
in two dimensions;
that's your goal.

00:19:34.009 --> 00:19:39.543
So, the first question is,
"What should I use for the work

00:19:39.543 --> 00:19:42.817
done?"
What expression should I use

00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:47.545
for the work done in two
dimensions, because the force

00:19:47.545 --> 00:19:50.433
now is a vector;
force is not one number,

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:52.769
it's got an x part and a
y part.

00:19:52.769 --> 00:19:56.426
My displacement has also got an
x part and a y

00:19:56.426 --> 00:19:59.339
part and I can worry about what
I should use.

00:19:59.339 --> 00:20:02.631
So, I'm going to deduce the
quantity I want to use for

00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:05.673
ΔW, namely,
the tiny work done which is an

00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:09.676
extension of this.
I'm going to demand that since

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:14.684
I'm looking for a Work Energy
Theorem, I'm going to demand

00:20:14.684 --> 00:20:19.430
that, remember in one dimension
ΔK = F Δx.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.201
If we divide it by the time
over which it happens,

00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:26.279
I find dK/dt is equal to
force [F]

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:30.595
times velocity [v].
I'm going to demand that that's

00:20:30.595 --> 00:20:35.440
the power, force times velocity,
is what I call the power.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:40.766
And I'm going to look for
dK/dt in two dimensions,

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:44.183
of a body that's moving.
What's the rate at which

00:20:44.183 --> 00:20:46.150
kinetic energy is changing when
a body is moving?

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.829
For that, I need a formula for
kinetic energy.

00:20:48.829 --> 00:20:53.054
A formula for kinetic energy is
going to be again ½

00:20:53.054 --> 00:20:56.140
mv^(2).
I want that to be the same

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.134
entity, so I will choose it to
be that, but v^(2) has

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:04.400
got now v_x^(2)
+ v_y^(2),

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.617
because you know whenever you
take a vector V,

00:21:07.617 --> 00:21:10.959
then its length is the square
root of the x part

00:21:10.959 --> 00:21:13.620
squared plus the y part
squared.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:25.020
Any questions?
Okay, so let's take the rate of

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.759
change of this,
dK/dt.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:30.079
Again, you have to know your
calculus.

00:21:30.079 --> 00:21:34.619
What's the time derivative of
v_x^(2)?

00:21:34.619 --> 00:21:36.934
The rule from calculus says,
first take the derivative of

00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:39.579
v_x^(2) with
respect to v_x,

00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:42.832
which is 2v_x,
then take the derivative of

00:21:42.832 --> 00:21:45.299
v_x with
respect to time.

00:21:45.299 --> 00:21:49.396
So, you do the same thing for
the second term,

00:21:49.396 --> 00:21:53.309
2 v_y
dv_y/dt,

00:21:53.309 --> 00:21:58.905
and that gives me--the 2s
cancel, gives me

00:21:58.905 --> 00:22:04.091
mdv_x
/dtv_x + m

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:09.550
dv_y
/dtv_y.

00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:16.614
This is the rate at which the
kinetic energy of a body is

00:22:16.614 --> 00:22:20.049
changing.
So, what's my next step, yes?

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:24.579
Student: So what
happened to the half?

00:22:24.579 --> 00:22:26.599
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: The half got

00:22:26.599 --> 00:22:29.180
canceled by the two here.
Yes?

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:34.805
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:39.835
Shankar: That's correct.
So, what we want to do is to

00:22:39.835 --> 00:22:42.950
recognize this as ma in
the x direction,

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.740
because m times
dv_x/dt is

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:48.416
a_x,
and this is m times

00:22:48.416 --> 00:22:51.859
a_y.
Therefore, they are the forces

00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:55.226
in the x and y
directions, so I write

00:22:55.226 --> 00:22:59.670
F_xv_x +
F_yv_y.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.970
So the power,
when you go to two dimensions,

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:06.269
is not very different from one
dimension.

00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:08.514
In one dimension,
you had only one force and you

00:23:08.514 --> 00:23:10.755
had only one velocity.
In two dimensions,

00:23:10.755 --> 00:23:14.100
you got an x and
y component for each one,

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:19.706
and it becomes this.
So, this is what I will define

00:23:19.706 --> 00:23:23.502
to be the power.
When a body is moving and a

00:23:23.502 --> 00:23:26.169
force is acting on it,
the force has two components,

00:23:26.169 --> 00:23:28.000
the velocity has two
components;

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.960
this combination shall be
called "Power."

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.659
But now, let's multiply both
sides by Δt and write

00:23:35.659 --> 00:23:39.553
the change in kinetic energy is
equal to F_x

00:23:39.553 --> 00:23:42.928
and you guys think about what
happens when I multiply

00:23:42.928 --> 00:23:45.589
v_x by
Δt;

00:23:45.589 --> 00:23:47.759
v_x =
dx/dt.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:51.780
Multiplying by Δt just
gives me the distance traveled

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.331
in the x direction +
F_y times

00:23:55.331 --> 00:23:59.329
dy.
So, this is the tiny amount of

00:23:59.329 --> 00:24:05.041
work done by a force and it
generalizes what we had here,

00:24:05.041 --> 00:24:09.019
work done is force times
Δx.

00:24:09.019 --> 00:24:11.666
In two dimensions,
it's F_xdx +

00:24:11.666 --> 00:24:14.608
F_ydy.
It's not hard to guess that but

00:24:14.608 --> 00:24:17.170
the beauty is--this
combination--Now you can say,

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.010
you know what,
I didn't have to do all this,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:21.279
I could have always guessed
that in two dimensions,

00:24:21.279 --> 00:24:24.068
when you had an x and a
y you obviously have to

00:24:24.068 --> 00:24:26.103
add them.
There's nothing very obvious

00:24:26.103 --> 00:24:28.987
about it because this
combination is now guaranteed to

00:24:28.987 --> 00:24:31.980
have the property that if I call
this the work done.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.526
Then, it has the advantage that
the work done is in fact the

00:24:35.526 --> 00:24:38.877
change in kinetic energy.
I want to define work so that

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:41.797
its effect on kinetic energy is
the same as in 1D,

00:24:41.797 --> 00:24:44.955
namely, work done should be
equal to change in kinetic

00:24:44.955 --> 00:24:47.551
energy.
And I engineered that by taking

00:24:47.551 --> 00:24:51.193
the change in kinetic energy,
seeing whatever it came out to,

00:24:51.193 --> 00:24:54.410
and calling that the work done,
I cannot go wrong.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.202
But now, if you notice
something repeating itself all

00:24:58.202 --> 00:25:01.849
the time, which is that I had a
vector F,

00:25:01.849 --> 00:25:05.428
which you can write as I
times F_x + J

00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:08.560
times F_y,
I had a vector velocity,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.719
which is I times
v_x + J times

00:25:11.719 --> 00:25:15.317
v_y.
Then, I had a tiny distance

00:25:15.317 --> 00:25:19.572
moved by the particle,
which is I times dx +

00:25:19.572 --> 00:25:23.501
J times dy.
So, the particle moves from one

00:25:23.501 --> 00:25:26.712
point to another point.
The vector describing its

00:25:26.712 --> 00:25:29.329
location changes by this tiny
vector.

00:25:29.329 --> 00:25:31.539
It's just the step in the
x direction times

00:25:31.539 --> 00:25:33.793
I, plus step in the
y direction times

00:25:33.793 --> 00:25:36.638
J.
So, what you're finding is the

00:25:36.638 --> 00:25:39.534
following combination.
The x component of

00:25:39.534 --> 00:25:41.910
F times the x
component of v,

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.449
plus the y component of
F, times the y

00:25:44.449 --> 00:25:46.705
component of v.
Or F component of

00:25:46.705 --> 00:25:49.617
x times the distance
moved in x plus y

00:25:49.617 --> 00:25:52.630
component of F times the
displacement in y.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:57.470
So, we are running into the
following combination.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.592
We are saying,
there seem to be in all these

00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:04.368
problems two vectors,
I times A_x

00:26:04.368 --> 00:26:07.200
+ J times
A_y.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.386
A, for example,
could be the force that I'm

00:26:09.386 --> 00:26:11.266
talking about.
There's another vector

00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:14.289
B, which is I
times B_x + J

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:15.880
times B_y.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.268
Right?
For example,

00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:25.994
this guy could be standing in
for F,

00:26:25.994 --> 00:26:28.720
this could be standing in for
v.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.947
The combination that seems to
appear very naturally is the

00:26:33.947 --> 00:26:37.799
combination
A_xB_x +

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:44.139
A_yB_y.
It appears too many times so I

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:48.000
take it seriously,
give that a name.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.779
That name will be called a dot
product of A with

00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:54.300
B and is written like
this.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.250
Whenever something appears all
the time you give it a name;

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:04.665
this is A.B. So,
for any two vectors A

00:27:04.665 --> 00:27:07.545
and B,
that will be the definition of

00:27:07.545 --> 00:27:11.067
A.B.
Then, the work done by a force

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:15.346
F, that displaces a
particle by a tiny vector

00:27:15.346 --> 00:27:20.076
dr, is F.dr.
The particle's moving in the

00:27:20.076 --> 00:27:24.060
xy plane.
From one instant to the next,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:29.500
it can move from here to there.
That little guy is dr;

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.674
it's got a little bit
horizontal and it's got a little

00:27:32.674 --> 00:27:35.490
bit vertical,
that's how you build dr.

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:38.707
The force itself is some force
which at that point need not

00:27:38.707 --> 00:27:41.370
point at the direction in which
you're moving.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.298
It's some direction.
At each point,

00:27:43.298 --> 00:27:45.789
the force could have whatever
value it likes.

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:48.335
So, the dot product,
you know, sometimes you learn

00:27:48.335 --> 00:27:50.881
the dot product as
A_xB_x +

00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:53.220
A_yB_y,
you can ask,

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.460
"Who thought about it?"
Why is it a natural quantity?

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.330
And here is one way you can
understand why somebody would

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.329
think of this particular
combination.

00:28:01.329 --> 00:28:04.581
So, once you've got the dot
product, you've got to get a

00:28:04.581 --> 00:28:07.789
feeling for what it is.
The first thing we realize is

00:28:07.789 --> 00:28:11.130
that if you take a dot product
of A with itself,

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.845
then it's
A_xA_x +

00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:15.504
A_yA_y,
which is A_x^(2) +

00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:18.195
A_y^(2),
which is the length of the

00:28:18.195 --> 00:28:20.801
vector A,
which you can either denote

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:23.589
this way or just write it
without an arrow.

00:28:23.589 --> 00:28:26.842
So A.A is a positive
number that measures the length

00:28:26.842 --> 00:28:29.869
squared of the vector A,
likewise B.B.

00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:32.800
Now, we have to ask ourselves,
"What is A.B?"

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.270
So, somebody know what
A.B is?

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.278
Yep?
Student: [inaudible]

00:28:46.278 --> 00:28:48.291
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:51.265
so how do we know that?
How do we know it's length of

00:28:51.265 --> 00:28:54.252
A times length of
B times cosine of the

00:28:54.252 --> 00:28:56.210
angle?
You should follow from--Is it

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:59.090
an independent definition or is
it a consequence of this?

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.632
Yep?
Student: Well,

00:29:00.632 --> 00:29:02.140
you can derive using the Law of
Cosines.

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:02.769
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes.

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:06.619
He said we can derive it using
the Law of Cosines and that's

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:08.770
what I will do now.
In other words,

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:11.840
that definition which you may
have learnt about first is not

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.231
independent of this definition;
it's a consequence of this

00:29:15.231 --> 00:29:17.690
definition.
So, let's see why that's true.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:22.330
Let's draw two vectors here.
Here is A and here is

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:27.075
B, it's got a length
A, it's got a length

00:29:27.075 --> 00:29:29.297
B,
this makes an angle,

00:29:29.297 --> 00:29:31.865
θ_A with the
x axis,

00:29:31.865 --> 00:29:34.900
and that makes an angle
θ_B for the

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:38.751
x axis.
Now, do you guys agree that the

00:29:38.751 --> 00:29:43.793
x component of A
with the horizontal part of

00:29:43.793 --> 00:29:48.569
A is the A cos
θ_A?

00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:51.144
You must've seen a lot of
examples of that when you did

00:29:51.144 --> 00:29:54.058
all the force calculation.
And A_y is

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:57.684
equal to the length of A
times sin θ_A

00:29:57.684 --> 00:30:01.009
and likewise for B;
I don't feel like writing it.

00:30:01.009 --> 00:30:06.454
If you do that,
then A.B will be length

00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:14.076
of A, length of B
times (cos θ_A cos

00:30:14.076 --> 00:30:18.674
θ_B + sin
θ_A sin

00:30:18.674 --> 00:30:23.692
θ_B).
You've got to go back to your

00:30:23.692 --> 00:30:27.759
good old trig and it'll tell you
this cos cos plus sin

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.440
sin is cos (θ_A –
θ_B).So,

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:34.630
you find it is length of
A, length of B,

00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:37.579
cos (θ_A –
θ_B).

00:30:37.579 --> 00:30:40.904
Often, people simply say that
is AB cos θ,

00:30:40.904 --> 00:30:44.703
where it's understood that
θ is the angle between

00:30:44.703 --> 00:30:48.355
the two vectors.
So, the dot product that you

00:30:48.355 --> 00:30:53.519
learnt--I don't know which way
it was introduced to you first,

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:57.400
but these are two equivalent
definitions of the dot product.

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.600
In one of them,
if you're thinking more in

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.640
terms of the components of
A,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.256
a pair of numbers for A
and a pair of numbers for

00:31:04.256 --> 00:31:07.109
B, this definition of the
dot product is very nice.

00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:10.303
If you're thinking of them as
two little arrows pointing in

00:31:10.303 --> 00:31:12.952
different directions,
then the other definition,

00:31:12.952 --> 00:31:15.930
in which the lengths and the
angle between them appear,

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.670
that's more natural.
But numerically they're equal.

00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:27.238
An important property of the
dot product, which you can check

00:31:27.238 --> 00:31:30.859
either way, is the dot product
of A with B + C,

00:31:30.859 --> 00:31:34.182
is dot product of A with
B plus dot product of

00:31:34.182 --> 00:31:37.041
A with C.
That just means you can open

00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:39.581
all the brackets with dot
products as you can with

00:31:39.581 --> 00:31:40.670
ordinary products.

00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:49.369
Now, that's a very important
property of the dot product.

00:31:49.369 --> 00:31:53.566
So, maybe I can ask somebody,
do you know one property,

00:31:53.566 --> 00:31:56.829
significant property of the dot
product?

00:31:56.829 --> 00:32:00.379
Student: When two
vectors are perpendicular the

00:32:00.379 --> 00:32:02.367
dot product equals 0.
Professor Ramamurti

00:32:02.367 --> 00:32:03.365
Shankar: Oh that's
interesting, I didn't think

00:32:03.365 --> 00:32:04.059
about it.
Yes.

00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:09.177
One thing is if two vectors are
perpendicular the dot product is

00:32:09.177 --> 00:32:13.310
0 because the cosine of 90 is 0.
But what I had in mind--Of

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.050
course it's hard for me,
it's not fair I ask you some

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.579
question without saying what I'm
looking for.

00:32:18.579 --> 00:32:23.040
What can you say if you use a
different set of axis?

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.161
Yep?
Student: In this case it

00:32:26.161 --> 00:32:27.862
doesn't matter.
Professor Ramamurti

00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:29.375
Shankar: If you go to the
rotated axis,

00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:31.140
the components of vector
A will change.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:32.860
We have done that in the
homework;

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.237
we've done that in the class.
The components of B will

00:32:35.237 --> 00:32:37.009
also change.
Everything will get a prime.

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:39.778
But the combination,
A_xB_x +

00:32:39.778 --> 00:32:43.604
A_yB_y,
when you evaluate it before or

00:32:43.604 --> 00:32:47.944
after, will give the same answer
because it's not so obvious when

00:32:47.944 --> 00:32:51.298
you write it this way.
But it's very obvious when you

00:32:51.298 --> 00:32:54.724
write it this way because it's
clear to us if you stand on your

00:32:54.724 --> 00:32:56.769
head or you rotate the whole
axis.

00:32:56.769 --> 00:32:58.864
What you're looking for is the
length of A,

00:32:58.864 --> 00:33:01.130
which certainly doesn't change
on your orientation,

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.009
or the length of B,
or the angle between them.

00:33:04.009 --> 00:33:07.575
The angle θ_A
will change but the angle with

00:33:07.575 --> 00:33:10.029
the new x axis won't be
the same.

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:12.789
The angle with the new y
axis won't be the same.

00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:15.012
Likewise for B,
but the angle between the

00:33:15.012 --> 00:33:16.809
vectors, it's an invariant
property,

00:33:16.809 --> 00:33:19.432
something intrinsic to the two
vectors, doesn't change,

00:33:19.432 --> 00:33:21.230
so the dot product is an
invariant.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:24.693
This is a very important notion.
When you learn relativity,

00:33:24.693 --> 00:33:27.460
you will find you have one
observer saying something,

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:29.430
another observer saying
something.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:32.358
They will disagree on a lot of
things, but there are few things

00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:35.534
they will all agree on.
Those few things will be analog

00:33:35.534 --> 00:33:38.845
of A.B.
So, it's very good to have this

00:33:38.845 --> 00:33:41.569
part of it very clear in your
head.

00:33:41.569 --> 00:33:45.379
This part of elementary vector
analysis should be clear in your

00:33:45.379 --> 00:33:54.160
head.
Okay, so any questions about

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.136
this?
So, if you want,

00:33:57.136 --> 00:34:00.324
geometrically,
the work done by a force when

00:34:00.324 --> 00:34:03.289
it moves a body a distance
dr,

00:34:03.289 --> 00:34:06.394
a vector dr,
is the length of the force,

00:34:06.394 --> 00:34:09.835
the distance traveled,
times the cosine of the angle

00:34:09.835 --> 00:34:13.210
between the force and the
displacement vector.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:18.475
Okay, I'm almost ready for
business because,

00:34:18.475 --> 00:34:22.772
what is my goal?
I find out that in a tiny

00:34:22.772 --> 00:34:24.865
displacement,
F.dr,

00:34:24.865 --> 00:34:29.134
I start from somewhere,
I go to a neighboring place,

00:34:29.134 --> 00:34:33.773
a distance dr away.
The change in kinetic energy is

00:34:33.773 --> 00:34:36.038
F.dr.
So, let me make a big trip,

00:34:36.038 --> 00:34:39.115
okay, let me make a trip in the
xy plane made up of a

00:34:39.115 --> 00:34:42.348
whole bunch of little segments
in each one of which I calculate

00:34:42.348 --> 00:34:46.940
this,
and I add them all up.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.112
On the left-hand side,
the ΔKs,

00:34:50.112 --> 00:34:55.205
this whole thing was defined so
that it's equal to ΔK,

00:34:55.205 --> 00:34:57.410
right?
ΔK was equal to this,

00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.538
that's equal to all that.
So, if you add all the

00:34:59.538 --> 00:35:01.500
ΔKs, it's very clear
what you will get.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.638
You will get the kinetic energy
at the end minus kinetic energy

00:35:04.638 --> 00:35:07.122
at the beginning.
On the right-hand side,

00:35:07.122 --> 00:35:10.829
you are told to add F.dr
for every tiny segment.

00:35:10.829 --> 00:35:16.920
Well, that is written
symbolically as this.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.739
This is the notation we use in
calculus.

00:35:19.739 --> 00:35:22.616
That just means,
if you want to go from A

00:35:22.616 --> 00:35:26.166
to B along some path,
you chop up the path into tiny

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.045
pieces.
Each tiny segment,

00:35:28.045 --> 00:35:31.729
if it's small enough to be
approximated by a tiny vector

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:34.477
dr,
then take the dot product of

00:35:34.477 --> 00:35:38.030
that little dr,
with the force at that point,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.385
which means length of F,
times the length of the

00:35:40.385 --> 00:35:42.000
segment, times cosine of the
angle;

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.181
add them all up.
Then somebody will say,

00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:49.110
"Well, your segments are not
short enough for me."

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.324
We'll chop it up some more,
then chop it up some more,

00:35:51.324 --> 00:35:53.579
chop it up till your worst
critic has been silenced.

00:35:53.579 --> 00:35:57.033
That's the limit in which you
can write the answer as this

00:35:57.033 --> 00:35:59.817
integral.
Just like in calculus when you

00:35:59.817 --> 00:36:03.840
integrate a function you take
tiny intervals Δx,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.222
multiply F by
Δx, but then you make

00:36:06.222 --> 00:36:09.043
the intervals more and more
numerous but less and less wide

00:36:09.043 --> 00:36:11.912
and the limit of that is the
area under the graph and that's

00:36:11.912 --> 00:36:14.887
called "integral,"
you do the same thing now in

00:36:14.887 --> 00:36:18.658
two dimensions.
So, now maybe it'll be true,

00:36:18.658 --> 00:36:24.134
just like in one dimension,
the integral of this function

00:36:24.134 --> 00:36:29.219
will be something that depends
on the end points.

00:36:29.219 --> 00:36:32.258
I'm just going to call it
U(1) - U(2),

00:36:32.258 --> 00:36:35.643
of some function U,
just like it was in one

00:36:35.643 --> 00:36:36.610
dimension.

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.133
If that is true,
then my job is done because

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:45.599
then I have K_1 +
U_1 = K_2 +

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:46.850
U_2.

00:36:56.059 --> 00:36:58.933
So, when I'm looking for the
Law of Conservation of Energy,

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:01.708
I've got to go to some calculus
book and I got to ask the

00:37:01.708 --> 00:37:04.349
calculus book,
"Look, in one dimension you

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:08.173
told me integral of F
from start to end is really the

00:37:08.173 --> 00:37:11.997
difference of another function
G of the end minus the

00:37:11.997 --> 00:37:13.875
start,
with G as that function

00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:16.685
whose derivative is F."
Maybe there is going to be some

00:37:16.685 --> 00:37:19.638
other magic function you knew in
two dimensions related to

00:37:19.638 --> 00:37:20.936
F,
in some way,

00:37:20.936 --> 00:37:23.983
so that this integral is again
given by a difference of

00:37:23.983 --> 00:37:26.239
something there minus something
here.

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:28.788
If that is the case,
then you can rearrange it and

00:37:28.788 --> 00:37:33.744
get this.
But you will find that it's not

00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:38.948
meant to be that simple.
So, again, has anybody heard

00:37:38.948 --> 00:37:41.570
rumors about why it may not be
that simple?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.310
What could go wrong?

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:53.936
Okay so, yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:37:53.936 --> 00:37:55.856
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:37:55.856 --> 00:37:58.880
that's probably correct but say
it in terms of what we know.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.910
What can go wrong?
I'm saying in one end,

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.343
I did an integral;
the integral was the difference

00:38:04.343 --> 00:38:08.780
of two numbers and therefore I
got K + U = K + U.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:11.903
So, something could go wrong
somewhere here when I say this

00:38:11.903 --> 00:38:15.027
integral from start to finish is
the difference only of the

00:38:15.027 --> 00:38:17.289
ending point minus the starting
point.

00:38:17.289 --> 00:38:20.073
Is that reasonable or could you
imagine it depending on

00:38:20.073 --> 00:38:21.780
something else?
Yes?

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.474
Student: Well,
say you have one of your forces

00:38:24.474 --> 00:38:26.984
is friction.
If you take a certain path from

00:38:26.984 --> 00:38:30.035
point one to point two,
you should have the same thing

00:38:30.035 --> 00:38:33.126
in potential energy.
But if you take a longer path

00:38:33.126 --> 00:38:36.659
and there's friction involved,
your kinetic energy would be

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:37.534
reduced.
Professor Ramamurti

00:38:37.534 --> 00:38:39.431
Shankar: Absolutely correct.
It is certainly true that if

00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:42.160
you've got friction,
this is not going to work.

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.989
It doesn't even work in 1D.
In 1D, if I start here and end

00:38:45.989 --> 00:38:48.501
here, and I worry about
friction, if it went straight

00:38:48.501 --> 00:38:50.820
from here to here there's amount
of friction.

00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:54.478
If I just went back and forth
97 times and then I ended up

00:38:54.478 --> 00:38:57.885
there is 97 times more friction.
So, we agreed that if there's

00:38:57.885 --> 00:38:59.449
friction, this is not going to
work.

00:38:59.449 --> 00:39:01.818
But the trouble with friction
was, the force was not a

00:39:01.818 --> 00:39:03.650
function only of x and
y.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.929
It depended on the direction of
motion.

00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:09.755
But now, I grant you that the
force is not a function of

00:39:09.755 --> 00:39:11.817
velocity.
It's only a function of where

00:39:11.817 --> 00:39:13.680
you are.
Can something still be wrong?

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:22.410
Well, let me ask you the
following question.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.240
Another person does this.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:29.861
[Shows a different path from 1
to 2]

00:39:29.861 --> 00:39:33.495
Do you think that person should
do the same amount of work

00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:37.130
because the force is now
integrated on a longer path?

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.438
So, you see,
in one dimension there's only

00:39:39.438 --> 00:39:41.410
one way to go from here to
there.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:44.408
Just go, right?
That way, when you write an

00:39:44.408 --> 00:39:46.622
integral you write the lower
limit and the upper limit and

00:39:46.622 --> 00:39:48.913
you don't say any more because
it's only one way in 1D to go

00:39:48.913 --> 00:39:51.050
from x_1 to
x_2.

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.263
In two dimensions,
there are thousands of ways to

00:39:53.263 --> 00:39:54.969
go from one point to another
point.

00:39:54.969 --> 00:39:58.599
You can wander all over the
place and you end up here.

00:39:58.599 --> 00:40:01.221
Therefore, this integral,
even if I say the starting

00:40:01.221 --> 00:40:03.894
point is r_1
and the ending point is

00:40:03.894 --> 00:40:05.880
r_2,
that this is

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.914
r_1 and that's
r_2,

00:40:08.914 --> 00:40:11.348
it's not adequate.
What do you think I should

00:40:11.348 --> 00:40:13.948
attach to this integration?
What other information should I

00:40:13.948 --> 00:40:17.260
give?
What more should I specify?

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.843
Yep?
Student: Along a closed

00:40:19.843 --> 00:40:20.539
path.
Professor Ramamurti

00:40:20.539 --> 00:40:21.320
Shankar: No,
it's not a closed path.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:25.071
I'm going from 1 to 2.
What more should I tell you

00:40:25.071 --> 00:40:28.110
before you can even find the
work done?

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.049
Yes?
Student: What path

00:40:32.049 --> 00:40:33.528
you're going on.
Professor Ramamurti

00:40:33.528 --> 00:40:36.223
Shankar: You have to say
which path you're going on

00:40:36.223 --> 00:40:38.170
because if you only have two
points,

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:42.860
1 and 2, then there is a work
done but it depends on the path.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.970
If the work depends on the
path, then the answer cannot be

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.971
a function of U(1) -
U(2), cannot just be U(1)

00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:50.931
- U(2).
U(1) - U(2) says,

00:40:50.931 --> 00:40:53.261
tell me what you entered,
tell me where you start,

00:40:53.261 --> 00:40:56.020
and that difference of some
function U between those

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.362
two points is the work done.
In other words,

00:40:58.362 --> 00:41:01.040
I'm asking you to think
critically about whether this

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.885
equality really could be true.
This is some function U

00:41:04.885 --> 00:41:09.176
in the xy plane evaluated
at one point minus the other

00:41:09.176 --> 00:41:11.695
point.
This is on a path joining those

00:41:11.695 --> 00:41:15.266
two points but I have not told
you which path and I can draw

00:41:15.266 --> 00:41:18.050
any path I like with those same
end points.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.696
And you got to realize that
it's very unreasonable to expect

00:41:20.696 --> 00:41:22.292
that.
No matter which path you take

00:41:22.292 --> 00:41:26.177
you will get the same answer.
Okay, so you might think that

00:41:26.177 --> 00:41:31.646
I'm creating a straw man because
it's going to turn out by some

00:41:31.646 --> 00:41:34.351
magic,
that no matter what force you

00:41:34.351 --> 00:41:36.461
take somehow,
due to the magic of

00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:39.099
mathematics,
the integral will depend only

00:41:39.099 --> 00:41:42.170
on the end points.
But that's not the case.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:46.940
In general, that won't happen.
So, I have to show you that.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:51.812
So, I'm going to start by
asking you, give me a number

00:41:51.812 --> 00:41:54.200
from 1 to 3.
2?

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:58.381
Okay, 2.
Then, I want a few more

00:41:58.381 --> 00:42:02.260
numbers, another number from 1
to 3.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.747
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: From 1 to 3,

00:42:03.747 --> 00:42:06.970
[audience laughs].
All right then, two more.

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:11.599
Mark, you pick a number.
Student: [inaudible]

00:42:11.599 --> 00:42:12.339
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Good,

00:42:12.339 --> 00:42:17.430
thank you.
Then I need one more, yes?

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.312
1 to 3, a number from 1 to 3.
Student: [inaudible]

00:42:21.312 --> 00:42:22.398
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: 2,

00:42:22.398 --> 00:42:25.597
very good.
Okay, so you pick these numbers

00:42:25.597 --> 00:42:30.596
randomly, and I'm going to take
a force which looks like

00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:36.050
I times x^(2)y^(3) +
J times xy^(2),

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:38.880
okay?
I put the powers based on what

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.945
you guys gave me.
So, we picked the force in two

00:42:41.945 --> 00:42:44.500
dimensions out of the hat.
Now, let's ask,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.678
"Is it true for this force that
the work done in going from one

00:42:48.678 --> 00:42:51.710
point to another depends only on
the path,

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.079
or does it depend,
I mean, it depends only on the

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:57.040
end points or does it depend in
detail on how you go from the

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.790
end points?"
You all have to understand,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:04.220
before you copy anything down,
where we are going with this.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.415
What's the game plan?
So, let me tell you one more

00:43:07.415 --> 00:43:09.881
time because you can copy this
all you want,

00:43:09.881 --> 00:43:12.717
it will get you nowhere.
You should feel that you know

00:43:12.717 --> 00:43:15.514
where I'm going but the details
remain to be shown or you should

00:43:15.514 --> 00:43:19.142
have an idea what's happening.
If you try to generalize the

00:43:19.142 --> 00:43:23.002
Work Energy Theorem to two
dimensions, this is what

00:43:23.002 --> 00:43:26.010
happened so far.
You found a definition of work

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.936
which has the property that the
work done is the change in

00:43:28.936 --> 00:43:31.350
kinetic energy.
Then, you added up all the

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.733
changes of kinetic energy and
added up all the work done and

00:43:34.733 --> 00:43:37.657
you said K_2 -
K_1 is the

00:43:37.657 --> 00:43:40.780
integral of F.dr;
that's guaranteed to be true;

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.159
that's just based on Newton's
laws.

00:43:43.159 --> 00:43:46.644
What is tricky is the second
equality that that integral is

00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:49.947
the difference in a function
calculated at one end point

00:43:49.947 --> 00:43:53.074
minus the other end point.
If that was true,

00:43:53.074 --> 00:43:56.736
if the integral depended only
on the end points,

00:43:56.736 --> 00:44:00.710
then it cannot depend on the
path that you take.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.076
If it depends on the path,
every path you take within the

00:44:03.076 --> 00:44:05.190
same two end points will give
different numbers.

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:07.512
So, the answer cannot simply be
U_1 -

00:44:07.512 --> 00:44:09.972
U_2.
First, I'm trying to convince

00:44:09.972 --> 00:44:12.579
you, through an example that I
selected randomly,

00:44:12.579 --> 00:44:15.320
that if you took a random force
and found the work done along

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.382
one path, or another path,
you will in fact get two

00:44:18.382 --> 00:44:20.239
different answers,
okay?

00:44:20.239 --> 00:44:23.074
That's the first thing,
to appreciate that there's a

00:44:23.074 --> 00:44:24.367
problem.
So generally,

00:44:24.367 --> 00:44:27.148
if we took a random force,
not a frictional force,

00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:30.440
a force that depends only on
location and not velocity,

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:33.774
it will not be possible to
define a potential energy nor

00:44:33.774 --> 00:44:37.533
will it be possible to define a
K + U so that it doesn't

00:44:37.533 --> 00:44:40.028
change.
So, it's going to take a very

00:44:40.028 --> 00:44:43.370
special force for which the
answer depends only on the

00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:46.460
starting and ending point and
not on the path.

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.294
To show you that that's a
special situation,

00:44:49.294 --> 00:44:53.501
I'm taking a generic situation,
namely, a force manufactured by

00:44:53.501 --> 00:44:56.909
this class, without any prior
consultation with me,

00:44:56.909 --> 00:44:59.243
and I will show you that for
that force the answer is going

00:44:59.243 --> 00:45:02.475
to depend on how you go.
So, let's take that force and

00:45:02.475 --> 00:45:06.620
let's find the work done in
going from the origin to the

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:11.690
point 1,1.
So, I'm going to take two paths.

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:14.658
One path I'm going to go
horizontally till I'm below the

00:45:14.658 --> 00:45:20.064
point.
Then I'm going straight up,

00:45:20.064 --> 00:45:23.701
okay.
So, let's find the work done

00:45:23.701 --> 00:45:27.644
when I go this way.
So again, you should be

00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:31.438
thinking all the time.
You should say if this guy got

00:45:31.438 --> 00:45:34.699
struck by lightning can I do
anything, or am I just going to

00:45:34.699 --> 00:45:37.739
say "Well, I don't know what he
was planning to do."

00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:39.579
You've got to have some idea
what I'm going to do.

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:42.452
I'm going to integrate
F.dr, first on the

00:45:42.452 --> 00:45:45.570
horizontal segment,
then on the vertical segment.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.778
F is some vector you
give me at the point x

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.528
and y;
I'll plug in some numbers,

00:45:49.528 --> 00:45:51.845
I'll get something times
I and something times

00:45:51.845 --> 00:45:54.025
J.
It may be pointing like that at

00:45:54.025 --> 00:45:56.519
this point, and that's F,
that's given.

00:45:56.519 --> 00:46:00.101
Now, when I'm moving
horizontally my displacement

00:46:00.101 --> 00:46:03.310
dr, has only got a
dx part.

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.907
I hope you see that.
Every step I move,

00:46:05.907 --> 00:46:09.219
there's no dy in it,
it's all horizontal.

00:46:09.219 --> 00:46:15.748
So, F.dr just becomes
F_xdx because

00:46:15.748 --> 00:46:21.489
there is no dy when you
move horizontally.

00:46:21.489 --> 00:46:23.202
So, when you do the integral,
you have

00:46:23.202 --> 00:46:27.161
F_xdx.
F_x happens to

00:46:27.161 --> 00:46:31.860
be x^(2)y^(3)dx,
x going from 0 to 1.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.139
Now, what do I do with
y^(3)?

00:46:36.139 --> 00:46:38.337
You all know how to integrate a
function of x times

00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:41.070
dx.
What do I do with y^(3)?

00:46:41.070 --> 00:46:43.747
What do you think it means?
Student: [inaudible]

00:46:43.747 --> 00:46:45.030
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Pardon me?

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:51.156
What should I do with y?
Evaluate y on that path

00:46:51.156 --> 00:46:54.359
at that point.
Well, it turns out,

00:46:54.359 --> 00:46:58.340
throughout this horizontal
segment y = 0,

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.630
so this is gone.
Basically, the point is very

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:03.750
simple.
When you move horizontally,

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.969
you're working against
horizontal forces doing work,

00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:09.677
but on the x axis when
y is 0 there is no

00:47:09.677 --> 00:47:12.282
horizontal force;
that's why there's nothing to

00:47:12.282 --> 00:47:14.159
do.
Now, you come to this segment.

00:47:14.159 --> 00:47:17.071
I think you all agree,
the distance traveled is

00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:20.306
J times dy.
So, I have to have another

00:47:20.306 --> 00:47:22.890
segment, the second part of my
trip, which is

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.239
F_y times
dy,

00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:30.166
and y goes from 0 to 1,
and the y component is

00:47:30.166 --> 00:47:33.190
xy^(2)dy,
where y goes from 0 to 1.

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:39.012
But now, on the entire line
that I'm moving up and down,

00:47:39.012 --> 00:47:41.719
x = 1.
Do you see that?

00:47:41.719 --> 00:47:45.796
x is a constant on the
line so you can replace x

00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:49.138
by 1 and integral of
y^(2)dy is y^(3)

00:47:49.138 --> 00:47:52.510
over 3.The work done is,
therefore, 1/3 joules.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.552
So, the work done in going
first to the right and then to

00:47:56.552 --> 00:47:57.780
the top is 1/3.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:09.539
You can also go straight up and
then horizontally.

00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:11.307
By a similar trick,
I won't do that now,

00:48:11.307 --> 00:48:13.937
because I want to show you
something else that's useful for

00:48:13.937 --> 00:48:15.803
you,
I'm going to pick another path

00:48:15.803 --> 00:48:18.860
which is not just made up of
x and y segments.

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.466
Then it's very easy to do this.
So, I'm going to pick another

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:25.750
way to go from 0,0 to 1,1,
which is on this curve;

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:28.590
this is the curve y =
x^(2).

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.038
First of all,
you've got to understand the

00:48:35.038 --> 00:48:37.376
curve y = x^(2) goes
through the two points I'm

00:48:37.376 --> 00:48:39.506
interested in.
If you took y =

00:48:39.506 --> 00:48:41.449
5x^(2),
it doesn't work.

00:48:41.449 --> 00:48:44.760
But this guy goes through 0,0
and goes through 1,1.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.059
And I'm asking you,
if I did the work done by the

00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:51.360
force along that segment,
what is the integral of

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:55.162
F.dr?
So, let's take a tiny portion

00:48:55.162 --> 00:48:59.729
of that, looks like this,
right, that's dr,

00:48:59.729 --> 00:49:04.389
it's got a dx,
and it's got a dy.

00:49:04.389 --> 00:49:11.518
Now, you notice that as this
segment becomes very small

00:49:11.518 --> 00:49:19.917
dy/dx is a slope;
therefore, dy will be

00:49:19.917 --> 00:49:25.825
dy/dx times dx.
In other words,

00:49:25.825 --> 00:49:28.284
dx and dy are not
independent if they're moving in

00:49:28.284 --> 00:49:30.619
a particular direction.
I hope you understand that.

00:49:30.619 --> 00:49:32.139
You want to follow a certain
curve.

00:49:32.139 --> 00:49:34.959
If you step to the right by
some amount, you've got to step

00:49:34.959 --> 00:49:38.070
vertically by a certain amount
so you're moving on that curve.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:40.920
That's why, when you calculate
the work done,

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:43.900
dx and dy are not
independent.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:48.165
So, what you really want is
F_xdx +

00:49:48.165 --> 00:49:52.702
F_ydy,
but for dy I'm going to

00:49:52.702 --> 00:49:56.059
use dy/dx times
dx.

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:59.053
In other words,
every segment Δy that

00:49:59.053 --> 00:50:02.998
you have is related to the
Δx you took horizontally

00:50:02.998 --> 00:50:07.216
so that you stay on that curve.
So, everything depends only on

00:50:07.216 --> 00:50:10.116
dx.
But what am I putting inside

00:50:10.116 --> 00:50:11.914
the integral?
Let's take

00:50:11.914 --> 00:50:15.062
F_x,
the x component is

00:50:15.062 --> 00:50:19.307
x^(2)y^(3).
On this curve y = x^(2),

00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:22.204
so you really write
x^(2),

00:50:22.204 --> 00:50:26.369
and y = x^(2),
that is x^(6).

00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:28.739
This x^(3) [should have
said x^(6)]

00:50:28.739 --> 00:50:31.860
is really y^(3) written
in terms of x.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.418
Then, I have to write
F_y,

00:50:38.418 --> 00:50:41.630
which is x times
y^(2),

00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:45.080
which is x^(4) times
dy/dx which is 2x.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:55.748
So, I get here,
from all of this,

00:50:55.748 --> 00:51:02.750
(x^(8) + 2x^(5))dx.
Did I make a mistake somewhere?

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.262
Pardon me?
Student: The second part

00:51:06.262 --> 00:51:07.957
of this.
Professor Ramamurti

00:51:07.957 --> 00:51:09.350
Shankar: Did I,
here?

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.949
Here?
Student: No.

00:51:12.949 --> 00:51:15.980
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Oh here?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.425
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:51:17.425 --> 00:51:18.280
Shankar: Oh,
x^(6),

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.700
right, thank you.
How is that?

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:22.530
Thanks for watching that;
you have to watch it.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:26.735
So, now what do I get?
x^(8) integral is

00:51:26.735 --> 00:51:30.237
x^(9)/9.
That gives me 1,9 because x is

00:51:30.237 --> 00:51:33.801
going from 0 to 1.
The next thing is

00:51:33.801 --> 00:51:38.989
x^(7)/7,
which is 2 times that.

00:51:38.989 --> 00:51:42.077
Well, I'm not paying too much
attention to this because I know

00:51:42.077 --> 00:51:43.139
it's not 1/3,
okay?

00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:47.067
There's no way this guy's going
to be 1/3, that's all I care

00:51:47.067 --> 00:51:49.887
about.
So, I've shown you that if we

00:51:49.887 --> 00:51:53.753
took a random force,
the work done is dependent on

00:51:53.753 --> 00:51:55.590
the path.
For this force,

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:59.150
you cannot define a potential
energy whereas in one dimension

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:02.354
any force that was not friction
allowed you to define a

00:52:02.354 --> 00:52:04.454
potential energy.
In higher dimensions,

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.809
you just cannot do that;
that's the main point.

00:52:06.809 --> 00:52:09.844
So, if you're looking for a
conservative,

00:52:09.844 --> 00:52:12.880
this is called a "conservative
force."

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.550
It's a force for which you can
define a potential energy.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:18.880
It has the property of the work
done in going from A to

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.556
B, or 1 to 2,
is independent of how you got

00:52:21.556 --> 00:52:24.109
from 1 to 2.
And the one force that the

00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:27.790
class generated pretty much
randomly is not a conservative

00:52:27.790 --> 00:52:31.019
force because the work done was
path dependent.

00:52:31.019 --> 00:52:35.912
So, what we have learned,
in fact I'll keep this portion

00:52:35.912 --> 00:52:40.449
here, if you're looking for a
conservative force,

00:52:40.449 --> 00:52:44.752
a force whose answer does not
depend on how you went from

00:52:44.752 --> 00:52:48.285
start to finish,
then you have to somehow dream

00:52:48.285 --> 00:52:52.972
up some force so that if you did
this integral the answer does

00:52:52.972 --> 00:52:55.881
not depend on the path.
You realize,

00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:59.118
that looks really miraculous
because we just wrote down an

00:52:59.118 --> 00:53:02.298
arbitrary force that we all
cooked up together with these

00:53:02.298 --> 00:53:04.732
exponents,
and the answer depends on the

00:53:04.732 --> 00:53:06.174
path.
And I guarantee you,

00:53:06.174 --> 00:53:08.682
if you just arbitrarily write
down some force,

00:53:08.682 --> 00:53:11.200
it won't work.
So, maybe there is no Law of

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.060
Conservation of Energy in more
than one dimension.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.986
So, how am I going to search
for a force that will do the

00:53:21.986 --> 00:53:23.971
job?
Are there at least some forces

00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:26.280
for which this will be true?
Yes?

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.062
Student: The force is
always parallel to the path

00:53:28.062 --> 00:53:29.811
along which you have [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:53:29.811 --> 00:53:32.756
Shankar: No,
but see the point is you've got

00:53:32.756 --> 00:53:36.610
to first write down a force in
the xy plane.

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.587
Then, I should be free to pick
any two points and connect them

00:53:39.587 --> 00:53:42.272
any way I like and the answer
shouldn't depend on how we

00:53:42.272 --> 00:53:44.433
connected them.
Only then, you can have

00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:47.945
conservation of energy.
I hope you all understand that

00:53:47.945 --> 00:53:49.292
fact.
So, I'm saying,

00:53:49.292 --> 00:53:52.659
a generic force on the
xy plane doesn't do that.

00:53:52.659 --> 00:53:54.930
Then we ask,
"Can there ever be an answer?"

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.739
It is so demanding.
Yes?

00:53:56.739 --> 00:53:59.317
Student: Well,
in the inverse square force

00:53:59.317 --> 00:54:00.768
they've got it.
Professor Ramamurti

00:54:00.768 --> 00:54:01.600
Shankar: Right,
so he's saying,

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.047
"I know a force."
The force of gravity,

00:54:03.047 --> 00:54:05.690
in fact, happens to have the
property that the work done by

00:54:05.690 --> 00:54:08.060
the force of gravity does not
depend on the path.

00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:11.530
We will see why that is true.
But you see,

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:15.127
what I want is to ask,
"Is there a machine that'll

00:54:15.127 --> 00:54:17.769
manufacture conservative
forces?"

00:54:17.769 --> 00:54:19.699
and I'm going to tell you there
is.

00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:23.346
I will show you a machine
that'll produce a large number,

00:54:23.346 --> 00:54:26.015
an infinite number of
conservative forces,

00:54:26.015 --> 00:54:28.750
and I'll show you how to
produce that.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.087
Here is the trick.
The trick is,

00:54:31.087 --> 00:54:34.844
instead of taking a force and
finding if there's a potential

00:54:34.844 --> 00:54:37.710
that will come from it by doing
integrals,

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.559
let me assume there is a
potential.

00:54:39.559 --> 00:54:44.003
Then, I will ask what force I
can associate with the

00:54:44.003 --> 00:54:47.139
potential, and here is the
answer.

00:54:47.139 --> 00:54:51.811
The answer is,
step one, pick any U of

00:54:51.811 --> 00:54:58.460
x and y.
You pick the function first.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.659
That function is going to be
your potential energy;

00:55:01.659 --> 00:55:04.889
it's been anointed even before
we do anything.

00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:08.972
But then, from the potential,
I want you to manufacture the

00:55:08.972 --> 00:55:12.356
following force.
I want the force that I'm going

00:55:12.356 --> 00:55:16.044
to find to have an x
component, which is [minus]

00:55:16.044 --> 00:55:19.800
the derivative of U with
respect to x,

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:21.807
and is going to have a y
component which is [minus]

00:55:21.807 --> 00:55:23.710
the derivative of U with
respect to y.

00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:31.842
That is step two.
In fact, the claim now is this

00:55:31.842 --> 00:55:34.670
force is going to be a
conservative force.

00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:37.148
And in fact,
this potential energy

00:55:37.148 --> 00:55:41.580
associated with it will be the
function you started with.

00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:45.676
So, how do I know that?
So, for example,

00:55:45.676 --> 00:55:49.844
I'm saying suppose U =
xy^(3), then

00:55:49.844 --> 00:55:54.630
F_x = -dU/dx,
which is equal to

00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:57.910
-y^(3),
and F_y,

00:55:57.910 --> 00:56:02.789
which is -dU/dy would be
-3xy^(2).

00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:04.046
The claim is,
if you put I times

00:56:04.046 --> 00:56:05.303
F_x and
J times

00:56:05.303 --> 00:56:08.080
F_y,
the answer will not depend on

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:13.650
how you go from start to finish.
So, let me prove that to you.

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:17.385
Here is the proof.
The change in the function

00:56:17.385 --> 00:56:21.800
U, in the xy
plane, you guys remember me

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:26.524
telling you,
is dU/dx times dx +

00:56:26.524 --> 00:56:31.350
dU/dy times dy.
That's the whole thing of

00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:34.594
mathematical preliminaries which
was done somewhere,

00:56:34.594 --> 00:56:36.836
I forgot, here.
It says, here,

00:56:36.836 --> 00:56:41.223
ΔF is dF/dx
times Δx + dF/dy times

00:56:41.223 --> 00:56:44.527
Δy.
I'll apply that to the function

00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:48.500
U, but who is this?
You notice what's going on here?

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:52.359
dU/dx times dx,
this is F_x,

00:56:52.359 --> 00:56:55.353
with a minus sign,
that's F_y

00:56:55.353 --> 00:56:59.413
with the minus sign.
Therefore this is equal to

00:56:59.413 --> 00:57:00.740
-F.dr.

00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:08.502
Right?
Because we agree,

00:57:08.502 --> 00:57:10.499
the force that I want to
manufacture is related to

00:57:10.499 --> 00:57:14.100
U in this fashion.
Now, if you add all the

00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:19.555
changes, the right-hand side
becomes the integral of

00:57:19.555 --> 00:57:23.364
F.dr,
and the left-hand side becomes

00:57:23.364 --> 00:57:27.039
the sum of all the ΔUs
with a minus sign.

00:57:27.039 --> 00:57:31.343
Add all the ΔUs with a
minus sign, that'll just become

00:57:31.343 --> 00:57:33.530
U at 1 -U at 2.

00:57:40.719 --> 00:57:44.070
It is cooked up so that
F.dr is actually at the

00:57:44.070 --> 00:57:47.222
change in the function U.
That's if you say,

00:57:47.222 --> 00:57:49.059
what was the trick that you
did?

00:57:49.059 --> 00:57:53.401
I cooked up a force by design
so that F.dr was a change

00:57:53.401 --> 00:57:56.866
in a certain function U.
If I add all the F.drs,

00:57:56.866 --> 00:57:59.100
I'm going to get a change in
the function U from start

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.813
to finish and it's got to be
U_1 -

00:58:00.813 --> 00:58:01.670
U_2.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:10.500
So, I don't know how else I can
say this.

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:16.806
Maybe the way to think about it
is, why do certain integrals not

00:58:16.806 --> 00:58:20.909
depend on how you took the path,
right?

00:58:20.909 --> 00:58:22.140
Let me ask you a different
question;

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.886
forget about integrals.
You are on top of some hilly

00:58:25.886 --> 00:58:28.328
mountain.
We have a starting point,

00:58:28.328 --> 00:58:30.400
you have an ending point,
okay.

00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:33.673
I started the starting point,
and I walked to the ending

00:58:33.673 --> 00:58:36.176
point.
At every portion of my walk,

00:58:36.176 --> 00:58:39.360
I keep track of how many feet
I'm climbing;

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.059
that's like my ΔU.
I add them all up.

00:58:43.059 --> 00:58:45.672
At the end of the day,
the height change will be the

00:58:45.672 --> 00:58:48.131
top of the mountain minus bottom
of the mountain,

00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:50.878
the height of the mountain.
You go on a different path,

00:58:50.878 --> 00:58:53.454
you don't go straight for the
summit, you loop around and you

00:58:53.454 --> 00:58:55.949
coil and you wind down,
you go up, you do this,

00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:58.050
and you also end up at the
summit.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:01.683
If you kept track of how long
you walked, it won't be the same

00:59:01.683 --> 00:59:03.510
as me.
But if you also kept track of

00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.885
how many feet you climbed and
you added them all up,

00:59:05.885 --> 00:59:08.903
what answer will you get?
You'll get the same answer I

00:59:08.903 --> 00:59:11.250
got.
Therefore, if what you were

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.329
keeping track of was the height
change in a function,

00:59:15.329 --> 00:59:18.112
then the sum of all the height
changes will be simply the total

00:59:18.112 --> 00:59:20.089
height change,
which is the height at the end

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:23.123
minus height at the beginning.
Therefore, starting with the

00:59:23.123 --> 00:59:25.722
height function,
by taking its derivatives,

00:59:25.722 --> 00:59:29.739
if you manufacture a force,
this will be none other than

00:59:29.739 --> 00:59:32.440
the fact of adding up the
changes.

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:35.512
And that's why this will be
K_2 -

00:59:35.512 --> 00:59:38.175
K_1,
and then you will get

00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:41.521
K_1 + U_1
= K_2 +

00:59:41.521 --> 00:59:44.809
U_2.
I hope you understand how

00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:47.909
conservative forces are not
impossible to get.

00:59:47.909 --> 00:59:50.219
In fact, for every function
U of x and

00:59:50.219 --> 00:59:52.348
y you can think of,
you can manufacture a

00:59:52.348 --> 00:59:56.081
conservative force.
So, you may ask the following

00:59:56.081 --> 00:59:59.047
question.
Maybe there are other ways to

00:59:59.047 --> 01:00:03.052
manufacture the conservative
force and you just thought of

01:00:03.052 --> 01:00:06.944
one, and the answer is "no."
Not only is this a machine that

01:00:06.944 --> 01:00:09.929
generates conservative forces,
my two step algorithm,

01:00:09.929 --> 01:00:13.365
pick a U and take its
derivatives, every conservative

01:00:13.365 --> 01:00:16.742
force you get is necessarily
obtained by taking derivatives

01:00:16.742 --> 01:00:19.828
with respect to x and
y of some function

01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:22.972
U and that U will
be the potential energy

01:00:22.972 --> 01:00:26.803
associated with that force.
So, when that force alone acts

01:00:26.803 --> 01:00:30.329
on a body the kinetic plus that
potential will not change.

01:00:30.329 --> 01:00:37.015
Finally, you remember that when
the class picked a certain

01:00:37.015 --> 01:00:42.386
force, which I wrote here,
I went on a limb and I said I'm

01:00:42.386 --> 01:00:46.559
going to do the integral of this
force along this path and that

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:50.261
path and I'm going to get
different answers and show you

01:00:50.261 --> 01:00:53.755
we have a problem.
What if the force you had given

01:00:53.755 --> 01:00:56.139
me was actually a conservative
force?

01:00:56.139 --> 01:01:00.138
Then, I would be embarrassed
because then I'll find,

01:01:00.138 --> 01:01:03.822
after all the work,
this'll turn out to be again

01:01:03.822 --> 01:01:05.808
1/3.
So, I have to make sure right

01:01:05.808 --> 01:01:07.730
away that the force is not
conservative.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:13.449
How can you tell?
One way to say it is,

01:01:13.449 --> 01:01:16.730
ask yourself,
"Could that be some function

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:21.130
U whose x
derivative of this was this,

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.349
and whose y derivative
was that?"

01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:26.025
You can probably convince
yourself no function is going to

01:01:26.025 --> 01:01:28.794
do it for you because if you
took an x derivative you

01:01:28.794 --> 01:01:30.860
should've lost a power of
x here.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.399
That means, if you just took
the y derivative to go

01:01:33.399 --> 01:01:35.760
here, you should have more
powers of x and less

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.300
powers of y but this is
just the opposite way.

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:41.480
So, we know this couldn't have
come from a U.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:45.046
But there's a better test.
Instead of doing all that,

01:01:45.046 --> 01:01:48.094
instead of saying I'm satisfied
that this doesn't come from

01:01:48.094 --> 01:01:51.038
taking derivatives of the
U by looking at possible

01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:53.876
Us are not being
satisfied because maybe I'm not

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:56.651
clever enough.
There is a mechanical way to

01:01:56.651 --> 01:01:59.402
tell.
The mechanical way to tell is

01:01:59.402 --> 01:02:02.452
the following.
Maybe I want you guys to think

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:05.050
for a second about what the
recipe may be.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:09.574
If a force came from a function
U by taking derivatives,

01:02:09.574 --> 01:02:13.148
as written up there,
what can you say about the

01:02:13.148 --> 01:02:16.630
components of that force,
from the fact--yes?

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.968
Student: What is the
cross derivative [inaudible]

01:02:18.968 --> 01:02:20.840
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Right,

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.950
we know that for every function
U the cross derivatives

01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.500
are equal but the ordinary
derivatives are just the

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.050
F_x and
F_y;

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:34.101
therefore, d^(2)U over
dydx is really d

01:02:34.101 --> 01:02:37.440
by dy of
F_x.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.304
And I want that to be equal to
d by dx of

01:02:41.304 --> 01:02:45.597
F_y because
that would then be d^(2)U

01:02:45.597 --> 01:02:47.933
over dxdy.
In other words,

01:02:47.933 --> 01:02:50.711
if the force satisfies this
condition, the y

01:02:50.711 --> 01:02:52.934
derivative of
F_x is the

01:02:52.934 --> 01:02:55.489
x derivative
F_y.

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:58.809
Then, it has the right pedigree
to be a conservative force

01:02:58.809 --> 01:03:02.128
because if a force came from a
function U by taking

01:03:02.128 --> 01:03:04.927
derivatives,
the simple requirement of the

01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:09.050
cross derivatives are equal for
any function U tells me.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:11.087
See, if I take the y
derivative of

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.634
F_x,
I'm taking d^(2)U over

01:03:13.634 --> 01:03:15.554
dxdy.
And here, I'm taking

01:03:15.554 --> 01:03:18.590
d^(2)U over dydx
and they must be equal.

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:22.688
So, that's the diagnostic.
If I give you a force and I ask

01:03:22.688 --> 01:03:25.353
you, "Is it conservative?"
you simply take the y

01:03:25.353 --> 01:03:27.115
derivative of
F_x and the

01:03:27.115 --> 01:03:29.436
x derivative of
F_y and if they

01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:31.070
match you know it's
conservative.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:33.980
So, I can summarize by saying
the following thing.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.500
In two dimensions,
there are indeed many,

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:40.280
many forces for which the
potential energy can be defined.

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:43.505
But every one of them has an
ancestor which is simply a

01:03:43.505 --> 01:03:46.193
function, not a vector,
but a scalar function,

01:03:46.193 --> 01:03:49.179
an ordinary function of
x and y.

01:03:49.179 --> 01:03:51.610
Then, the force is obtained by
taking x and y

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:54.051
derivatives of that function;
the x derivative with a

01:03:54.051 --> 01:03:55.611
minus sign is called
F_x,

01:03:55.611 --> 01:03:57.969
and the y derivative is
called F_y.

01:03:57.969 --> 01:04:01.980
Okay, so let's take the most
popular example is the force of

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.699
gravity near the surface of the
Earth.

01:04:04.699 --> 01:04:12.630
The force of gravity we know is
-mg times J.

01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:15.826
Is this guy conservative?
Yes, because the x

01:04:15.826 --> 01:04:18.304
derivative of this vanishes and
the y derivative of

01:04:18.304 --> 01:04:20.999
F_x you don't
even have to worry because there

01:04:20.999 --> 01:04:23.989
is no F_x;
it's clearly conservative.

01:04:23.989 --> 01:04:26.728
Then you can ask,
"What is the potential U

01:04:26.728 --> 01:04:31.493
that led to this?"
Well, dU/dy with a minus

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:38.039
sign had to be -mg and
dU/dx had to be 0.

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:42.239
So, the function that will do
the job is mgy.

01:04:42.239 --> 01:04:46.228
You can also have mgy +
96 but we will not add those

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:49.487
constants because in the end,
in the Law of Conservation of

01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:51.663
Energy, K_1
+U_1 = K_2 +

01:04:51.663 --> 01:04:54.202
U_2,
adding a 96 to both sides

01:04:54.202 --> 01:04:56.937
doesn't do anything.
So this means,

01:04:56.937 --> 01:05:01.441
when a body's moving in the
gravitational field ½

01:05:01.441 --> 01:05:07.648
mv^(2) + mgy,
before, is the same as ½

01:05:07.648 --> 01:05:11.510
mv^(2) + mgy,
after.

01:05:16.969 --> 01:05:19.845
Now, you knew this already when
you're moving up and down the

01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:22.769
y direction but what I'm
telling you is this is true in

01:05:22.769 --> 01:05:24.988
two dimensions.
So, I'll give you a final

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:27.710
example so you guys can go home
and think about it.

01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:31.117
That is a roller coaster.
So, here's the roller coaster,

01:05:31.117 --> 01:05:33.050
it has a track that looks like
this.

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:35.905
This is x,
this is the height of the

01:05:35.905 --> 01:05:39.034
roller coaster,
but at every x there's a

01:05:39.034 --> 01:05:43.114
certain height so y is
the function of x and it

01:05:43.114 --> 01:05:45.946
looks like this.
It's just the profile of the

01:05:45.946 --> 01:05:48.769
roller coaster.
But that is also the potential

01:05:48.769 --> 01:05:51.997
energy U,
because if you multiply this by

01:05:51.997 --> 01:05:54.651
mg,
well, you just scale the graph

01:05:54.651 --> 01:05:58.005
by mg it looks the same.
So, take a photograph of a

01:05:58.005 --> 01:06:00.503
roller coaster,
multiply the height in meters

01:06:00.503 --> 01:06:02.887
by mg,
it's going to still look like

01:06:02.887 --> 01:06:06.655
the roller coaster.
That is my potential energy for

01:06:06.655 --> 01:06:11.388
this problem and the claim is
that kinetic plus potential will

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:14.880
not change, so K + U is a
constant;

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.139
let's call the constant
E.

01:06:18.139 --> 01:06:26.076
So, if a trolley begins here at
the top, what is its total

01:06:26.076 --> 01:06:29.119
energy?
It's got potential energy equal

01:06:29.119 --> 01:06:31.485
to the height,
it's got no kinetic energy,

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:34.139
so total energy in fact is just
its height.

01:06:34.139 --> 01:06:38.409
And total energy cannot change
as the trolley goes up and down.

01:06:38.409 --> 01:06:41.477
So, you draw a line at that
height and call it the total

01:06:41.477 --> 01:06:43.610
energy.
You started this guy off at

01:06:43.610 --> 01:06:46.630
that energy, that energy must
always be the same.

01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:49.999
What that means is,
if you are somewhere here,

01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:52.619
so that is your potential
energy,

01:06:52.619 --> 01:06:56.039
that is your kinetic energy,
it's very nicely read off from

01:06:56.039 --> 01:06:58.280
this graph, to reach the same
total.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:02.582
So, as you oscillate up and
down, you gain and lose kinetic

01:07:02.582 --> 01:07:04.871
and potential.
When you come here your

01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.746
potential energy is almost your
whole energy but you've got a

01:07:07.746 --> 01:07:10.826
little bit of kinetic energy.
That means, your roller coaster

01:07:10.826 --> 01:07:13.820
is still moving when it comes
here with the remaining kinetic

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:16.924
energy.
You can have a roller coaster

01:07:16.924 --> 01:07:21.890
whose energy is like this.
This is released from rest here.

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:24.981
It is released from rest here.
That's the total energy and

01:07:24.981 --> 01:07:27.679
this total energy line looks
like this.

01:07:27.679 --> 01:07:31.616
That means, if you released it
here, it'll come down,

01:07:31.616 --> 01:07:33.659
pick up speed,
slow down,

01:07:33.659 --> 01:07:36.143
pick up speed again,
and come to this point,

01:07:36.143 --> 01:07:39.203
it must stop and turn around
because at that point the

01:07:39.203 --> 01:07:42.437
potential energy is equal to
total energy and there is no

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:44.660
kinetic energy.
That means you've stopped,

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.760
that means you're turning
around, it'll rattle back and

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:47.110
forth.

01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:52.641
By the way, according to laws
of quantum mechanics,

01:07:52.641 --> 01:07:54.769
it can do something else.
Maybe you guys know.

01:07:54.769 --> 01:07:56.700
You know what else it can do if
it starts here?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:08:00.449
Yes?
Student: It can tunnel.

01:08:00.449 --> 01:08:02.723
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It can suddenly

01:08:02.723 --> 01:08:05.496
find itself here and that's not
allowed by classical mechanics

01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:07.769
because to do that it has to go
over the hump.

01:08:07.769 --> 01:08:09.590
Look what's happening at the
hump.

01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:13.019
I've got more kinetic energy
than I have total energy.

01:08:13.019 --> 01:08:15.992
I'm sorry, I've got more
potential energy than I have

01:08:15.992 --> 01:08:18.161
total energy.
That means kinetic energy is

01:08:18.161 --> 01:08:20.876
negative, that's not possible,
because ½ mv^(2) can

01:08:20.876 --> 01:08:23.421
never be negative.
So, quantum theory allows these

01:08:23.421 --> 01:08:25.789
forbidden processes and it's
called tunneling.

01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:28.804
But for us, the roller coaster
problem, you will just turn

01:08:28.804 --> 01:08:31.177
around.
There's one thing I want you to

01:08:31.177 --> 01:08:34.305
think about before you go.
You should not have simply

01:08:34.305 --> 01:08:37.541
accepted the Law of Conservation
of Energy in this problem

01:08:37.541 --> 01:08:40.720
because gravity is not the only
force acting on this.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.250
What else is acting on this
roller coaster?

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.182
Student: No friction.
Professor Ramamurti

01:08:45.182 --> 01:08:46.310
Shankar: Pardon me?
No friction, then what?

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:47.970
Student: The normal
force.

01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:49.217
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: The force of that

01:08:49.217 --> 01:08:50.819
track.
Look, if I didn't want to have

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:53.122
anything but gravity,
here's a roller coaster ride

01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:55.520
you guys will love,
just push you over the edge.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.410
That conserves energy and it's
got no track and it's got the

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:03.630
only gravitational force and you
can happily use this formula.

01:09:03.630 --> 01:09:06.744
Why am I paying all this money?
Because there's another force

01:09:06.744 --> 01:09:08.100
acting on it,
but that force,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.100
if it's not frictional,
is necessarily perpendicular to

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.075
the motion of the trolley,
and the displacement of the

01:09:14.075 --> 01:09:17.590
trolley is along the track,
so F.dr vanishes.

01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:20.264
So, I will conclude by telling
you the correct thing to do

01:09:20.264 --> 01:09:22.985
would be to say K_2
- K_1 is the

01:09:22.985 --> 01:09:26.443
integral of all the forces,
divided into force due to the

01:09:26.443 --> 01:09:28.930
track and the force due to
gravity.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:33.749
The force due to the track is 0.
I mean, it's not 0,

01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:35.828
but that dot product with
dr would be 0,

01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:38.180
because F and dr
are perpendicular.

01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.653
For that reason,
you'd drop that and the force

01:09:40.653 --> 01:09:43.951
of gravity is cooked up so then
it becomes U_1 -

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:46.480
U_2 and that's
what we used.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:56.047
Okay, one challenge you guys
can go home and do this,

01:09:56.047 --> 01:09:59.360
take any force in two
dimensions, F;

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:06.982
it is parallel to the direction
where you are measured from the

01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:09.850
origin times any function of the
distance from the origin.

01:10:13.319 --> 01:10:16.406
Show, convince yourself that
this force is a conservative

01:10:16.406 --> 01:10:19.714
force by applying the test I
gave you and the trick is to use

01:10:19.714 --> 01:10:22.250
x and y instead of
r.

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.986
Take this force,
write it now in terms of

01:10:23.986 --> 01:10:26.243
x and y,
take the cross derivatives and

01:10:26.243 --> 01:10:30.119
you can see it's conservative.
So, any radial force, yep?

01:10:30.119 --> 01:10:33.341
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

01:10:33.341 --> 01:10:34.920
Shankar: Oh,
here.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.330
This is the force to which you
should try your thing and

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:39.040
gravity is a special example of
this.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.499
Okay, judging from the class
reaction, and the stunned and

01:10:50.499 --> 01:10:53.050
shocked look,
a lot of you people,

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:56.244
maybe this material is new,
so you should think about it,

01:10:56.244 --> 01:10:58.640
talk about it,
go to discussion section,

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:01.912
but this is the level at which
you should understand energy

01:11:01.912 --> 01:11:04.000
conservation in a course like
this.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:04.275
So today we're going to be
talking about being a British

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.838
colonist,
which means we're going to be

00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:10.807
discussing how you would feel if
you were part of the British

00:00:10.807 --> 00:00:13.520
Empire in the mid-eighteenth
century,

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.485
living in the North American
colonies shortly before the

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:19.360
onset of the Revolution.
 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.260
And for those of you who were
not here on Tuesday,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.028
I talked for a little
while--I'll just mention it

00:00:24.028 --> 00:00:25.864
here--
about how this course was

00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:29.273
really going to be exploring the
mindset of the people who were

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:32.570
experiencing the Revolution to
really try to get at the logic

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.485
behind both what the British
colonists and the British

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.597
authorities were doing,
and how that ultimately

00:00:38.597 --> 00:00:39.760
resulted in a war.
 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.937
So we're really -- we're going
to try to really kind of create

00:00:42.937 --> 00:00:45.959
two opposing forms of logic and
understand how they came to

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:49.450
oppose each other and how that
ended up leading in to conflict.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.476
So it makes sense that as a
starting point we're going to

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.611
start by essentially talking
about some of the basics about

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.827
being a British colonist in
North America:

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:00.259
what their world would have
been like,

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:02.700
what your world would have been
like if you had been a colonist,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.980
what your feelings would have
been about yourself as part of

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.370
the British Empire if you were a
colonist in the middle of the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.650
eighteenth century.
 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.382
Now I'll note here just in
passing that the first part of

00:01:14.382 --> 00:01:17.577
Gordon Wood's Radicalism--
which I already mentioned

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.530
once--
that actually deals a lot with

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.778
a topic that I'll be talking
about today and I think in one

00:01:22.778 --> 00:01:25.721
or two more lectures,
the sort of idea about what the

00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.909
colonies were like prior to the
Revolution.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.251
That book overall presents an
argument about how the colonies

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:36.583
went from monarchy--
The first third of the book is

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:38.780
monarchy and then the second
third of the book is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.069
republicanism and then the third
is democracy,

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.319
and I think I said--Tuesday I
said,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.138
"Think about what words
mean," and I'm sure that

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.349
will come into play in Gordon
Wood,

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:50.092
but the monarchy section not
surprisingly goes into some

00:01:50.092 --> 00:01:53.033
depth about some of the things
I'm going to be talking about

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.596
today and on Tuesday,
which is, kind of:

00:01:55.596 --> 00:01:58.269
life in the colonies before the
war,

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.940
sort of just basically what did
it mean,

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.700
how did it work,
how did society function.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.078
Okay.
 

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:06.790
So let's actually start with
some of the basics.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.532
The first and most basic:
If you were a British colonist

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:14.002
here in North America,
you would be living somewhere

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.180
along the Atlantic seaboard.
 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.788
The colonial population was
largely clustered right along

00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:22.688
the shoreline for really
practical reasons.

00:02:22.688 --> 00:02:25.500
I'm sure you don't have to be
very imaginative to think why.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.128
Obviously, for reasons of
trade, for reasons of shipping

00:02:29.128 --> 00:02:33.090
and even just for reasons of
communication it made sense,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.870
not to mention the fact that
people had a pretty healthy fear

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.705
of potentially unfriendly
Indians who were not

00:02:39.705 --> 00:02:42.918
particularly pleased with the
idea of losing land to

00:02:42.918 --> 00:02:45.250
potentially advancing settlers.
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.656
Now if you were male,
you might very well be a small

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:54.407
landholder because about sixty
percent of the white male

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:58.424
colonists owned land and,
as I'll talk about down the

00:02:58.424 --> 00:03:01.055
road a little bit,
that's--actually when you

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:04.710
compare that with the rates of
land ownership in Europe,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.885
that's actually pretty high,
it's a pretty high rate of

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:08.801
ownership,
and even in today's lecture

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.846
you'll see how that actually has
an impact on how things are

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:13.908
functioning in the American
colonies.

00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:18.020
You probably would be a small
landholder.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.550
You might be if you were living
in one of the small cities along

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.960
the coast maybe a merchant or an
artisan.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.943
As a non-enslaved person,
you would probably have decent

00:03:28.943 --> 00:03:29.848
clothes.
 

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:31.318
You'd probably have a decent
home.

00:03:31.318 --> 00:03:35.260
You probably would have some
degree of economic and personal

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.212
independence,
and right around the

00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:42.346
turn--let's say 1770--
you would be one of about two

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:44.720
million North American
colonists,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.889
which is actually if you think
about it--

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.604
Certainly, if you--if I asked
you to guess how many colonists

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:51.038
there were in 1770,
you probably would not say two

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:51.470
million.
 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.264
It's a lot.
 

00:03:52.264 --> 00:03:55.729
And that includes both free
people and slaves,

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.490
and you would have been living
in a society that was so booming

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.788
with prosperity that between the
years 1700 and 1770--

00:04:04.788 --> 00:04:07.139
so we're just talking about a
seventy-year period--

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.019
the population increased from
200,000 to over two million in

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.680
just a seventy-year period,
which is amazing.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.100
So basically,
things were increasing.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.425
Every decade the population was
increasing at a rate of roughly

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:22.819
thirty to forty percent.
 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:24.680
That's a huge rate of growth.
 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.482
You would be living in the
midst of a host of British

00:04:28.482 --> 00:04:30.834
colonies,
so it's not just you along the

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.490
seaboard but obviously to the
north there is Canada,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.956
to the south there were British
islands in the West Indies which

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:42.151
were known as the Sugar Islands,
and to the west was the vast

00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.879
'scary wilderness' populated by
potentially unfriendly Indians

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.363
with what felt to you as though
it was an entirely foreign

00:04:49.363 --> 00:04:52.208
culture,
and then of course to the

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:55.550
east--there is civilization to
your east.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.709
There is the metropolis,
there is England,

00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:01.452
there is culture in the minds
of the colonists and probably to

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:05.345
many people in England as well,
the height of cultural and

00:05:05.345 --> 00:05:07.149
political sophistication.
 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:10.528
When you looked to the east,
and it really was--

00:05:10.528 --> 00:05:13.761
if you were a colonist it was
looking to the east towards

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:17.165
England that you really got a
sense of yourself as a British

00:05:17.165 --> 00:05:20.571
colonist and really felt that
you belonged to something that

00:05:20.571 --> 00:05:24.379
was powerful and admirable and
world-shaping and victorious.

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:28.057
Basically, you understood
yourself as being part of an

00:05:28.057 --> 00:05:32.430
empire by identifying with that
center of empire to the east.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.692
As an example of this,
just listen to someone who ends

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:37.000
up being a rather prominent
American revolutionary,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.529
and I mentioned him as a matter
of fact on Tuesday.

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.976
I called him the doctor to the
stars and that's kind of unfair

00:05:42.976 --> 00:05:44.560
to him, but Benjamin Rush.
 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.654
He actually was a really
prominent man of science at the

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:48.050
time.
 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.009
He moved in very high political
circles.

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.670
When I was thinking about this
lecture today I remembered,

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.836
or at least I hope I
remembered--I think I'm not

00:05:55.836 --> 00:05:58.749
leading you astray--
I think that actually Rush

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.889
helped Thomas Paine edit
Common Sense,

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.975
and I think he edited out a
sentence that I wished Paine had

00:06:05.975 --> 00:06:08.220
left in,
so I don't like Rush as an

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.278
editor very much.
 

00:06:09.278 --> 00:06:11.321
I think I'll--we'll wait until
we get to Common Sense

00:06:11.321 --> 00:06:12.559
but--
and supposedly,

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.656
allegedly, it's Rush who came
up with the title Common

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:17.077
Sense,
that Paine was going to

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:20.281
call it Plain Truth,
and Rush--I think Rush wins

00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:20.980
on that.
 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.427
I think Plain Truth is
not as snazzy as Common Sense

00:06:23.427 --> 00:06:26.139
but either way--
So Rush -- The--My main point

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:29.927
here in blathering happily about
Rush is he's not some little

00:06:29.927 --> 00:06:31.377
modest humbug of a guy.
 

00:06:31.377 --> 00:06:32.009
Right?
 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:33.360
He's someone of status.
 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.908
So this is Rush's response when
he saw the throne of the King of

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:38.629
England.
 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.050
So Rush said,
"I felt as though I were

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.600
on sacred ground.
 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.170
I gazed for some time at the
throne with emotions that I

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.730
cannot describe."
 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.074
Okay.
 

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:53.017
He's just dumbstruck at the
throne of the King of England,

00:06:53.017 --> 00:06:54.540
just looking at it.
 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.120
Now we sit here and we think
back.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.240
We're: "Oh,
boy, aren't those monarchists

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.466
really cute,"
[laughs]

00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:04.107
"those cute monarchists,
those silly people who are

00:07:04.107 --> 00:07:06.221
amazed at a throne,"
which is pretty much I think

00:07:06.221 --> 00:07:08.500
what I thought was--
wow, what an interesting phase

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.040
in American history when they
were dazzled by a throne.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.418
Then, a couple of years ago I
ended up being lucky enough to

00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:17.569
have a Member of Parliament show
me around the Houses of

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.430
Parliament.
 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.858
And I was excited;
it was pretty neat and I'm

00:07:20.858 --> 00:07:22.086
being all American
historian-ish,

00:07:22.086 --> 00:07:23.470
you know: "Oh,
how similar,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.120
how interesting when you
compare."

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.899
So I'm doing the geeky
historian thing and then this

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:31.060
member of Parliament who's
showing me around takes me in to

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.221
what he describes to me as the
robing chamber for the Queen

00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.656
where she puts on her crown and
ceremonial robes before she goes

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.829
in to the House of Lords,
which I gather she does at the

00:07:40.829 --> 00:07:42.588
beginning of every session of
Parliament.

00:07:42.588 --> 00:07:42.940
Okay.
 

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.117
So I walk in to [laughs]
the robing chamber and at the

00:07:45.117 --> 00:07:46.680
head of that room there's a
throne,

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.209
sort of an elevated throne,
so instantly,

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:51.428
without even thinking,
in my head, I'm thinking:

00:07:51.428 --> 00:07:52.509
wow,
[laughs]

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:54.951
that's the throne,
[laughs]

00:07:54.951 --> 00:08:00.120
and then I thought,
I just became Benjamin Rush.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.935
Just like that,
I went right into the monarchy

00:08:02.935 --> 00:08:03.500
vortex.
 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.644
It didn't really take me very
long, so I can't chortle at Rush

00:08:06.644 --> 00:08:07.160
anymore.
 

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.533
So there is something
impressive, and particularly at

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:11.449
this moment if you had been a
colonist--

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.401
and not that many people I
should say necessarily even got

00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:17.014
to travel to Europe;
I'll talk a little bit about

00:08:17.014 --> 00:08:19.571
that later on too--
but you certainly would have

00:08:19.571 --> 00:08:22.949
been awestruck and impressed by
something like the throne of the

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:23.970
King of England.
 

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:24.374
Okay.
 

00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:28.333
So, as suggested by Rush
quavering in front of the

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:33.019
throne, as a colonist you would
be proud to be British.

00:08:33.019 --> 00:08:36.966
You would have a really deep
affection for the mother country

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:40.846
and it would be an affection
that was really rooted in bonds

00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:43.610
of culture and tradition and
language.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.928
Basically, you would really
consider yourself lucky to

00:08:46.928 --> 00:08:50.500
belong to a powerful nation that
granted its citizens,

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.000
you believed,
more liberty than any nation on

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.820
earth.
 

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.149
Unlike other modern empires at
the time,

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:02.840
England seemed,
particularly to the English,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.817
to be an empire that was bound
together not by force but by

00:09:06.817 --> 00:09:10.865
bonds of interconnectedness and
affection as well as a joint

00:09:10.865 --> 00:09:13.176
appreciation,
a real love,

00:09:13.176 --> 00:09:15.149
of liberty and order.
 

00:09:15.149 --> 00:09:17.945
And we're going to come back to
this idea of liberty a little

00:09:17.945 --> 00:09:20.835
bit later in the course where we
start to really talk about the

00:09:20.835 --> 00:09:24.070
logic of revolution,
but for now I'll just highlight

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:28.011
the fact that if you asked an
English-speaking person of the

00:09:28.011 --> 00:09:32.086
eighteenth century about liberty
he or she would have told you

00:09:32.086 --> 00:09:34.960
that liberty was worth more than
life.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.720
Right? Liberty was it.
 

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.120
Liberty was what mattered.
 

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.836
It was the most important
possession of a civilized

00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:42.740
people,
and of course the British

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.719
people, colonists and all,
felt that they were at the peak

00:09:45.719 --> 00:09:47.019
of the civilized world.
 

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:51.620
As somebody at the time wrote,
"What signify riches?

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.279
What signifies health,
or life itself without liberty?

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:59.232
Life without liberty is the
most errant trifle,

00:09:59.232 --> 00:10:02.700
the most insignificant
enjoyment in the world."

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.528
Okay, extreme,
but something to think about.

00:10:05.528 --> 00:10:09.178
I suppose it's related to what
I said on Tuesday.

00:10:09.178 --> 00:10:12.390
I think it's also easy to hear
some of this talk that sounds

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.330
really inflated and to dismiss
it as mere rhetoric,

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.570
and I'm sure there is some mere
rhetoric floating around here,

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.206
but it's important I think not
to dismiss things that sound

00:10:21.206 --> 00:10:24.720
extreme and emotional as simply
emotional and extreme.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.756
Some of this actually
represents sincere thought so I

00:10:27.756 --> 00:10:31.028
think before you think these
guys are sort of overexcited

00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:33.304
about things,
think to yourself that they

00:10:33.304 --> 00:10:35.029
actually honestly may be
overexcited;

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:37.312
it might just be that they're
dramatic, but that they

00:10:37.312 --> 00:10:38.629
sincerely feel these things.
 

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:41.732
There was a time when
historians did assume that a lot

00:10:41.732 --> 00:10:45.303
of revolutionary rhetoric from
the colonists was actually kind

00:10:45.303 --> 00:10:47.721
of inflated,
kind of for propaganda

00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:51.188
purposes, and it took a while--
Actually, the Faces of

00:10:51.188 --> 00:10:54.004
Revolution book by Bailyn,
part of the book that I

00:10:54.004 --> 00:10:56.809
mentioned before that comes from
his larger book on the ideology

00:10:56.809 --> 00:10:59.067
of the Revolution,
he's the guy who said,

00:10:59.067 --> 00:11:02.668
"I've read several hundred
Revolutionary War pamphlets and

00:11:02.668 --> 00:11:04.759
I actually think they're
serious.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:06.308
I think we have to take them
seriously.

00:11:06.308 --> 00:11:08.710
I don't think it's propaganda
or rhetoric.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.230
I think they actually feel
these things."

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:14.852
So again, to us it might sound
a little inflated but their

00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:18.374
feelings are really strong,
and again liberty is one of the

00:11:18.374 --> 00:11:21.500
things that we'll find they're
feeling very strongly about.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.197
So as a colonist,
you would be proud to be

00:11:25.197 --> 00:11:27.759
British,
you would be really obviously

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:30.679
proud of British liberties,
and you would have been

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:34.085
particularly proud about being
British after the French and

00:11:34.085 --> 00:11:37.625
Indian War in the 1760s,
when North American colonists

00:11:37.625 --> 00:11:41.153
fought right alongside the
British army and helped them

00:11:41.153 --> 00:11:44.827
defeat England's great enemy,
the French--and more on that to

00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:46.654
come for sure,
but that was a really proud

00:11:46.654 --> 00:11:48.937
moment for the colonists,
that they felt that they were

00:11:48.937 --> 00:11:51.202
right there with the British
army fighting against the

00:11:51.202 --> 00:11:51.629
French.
 

00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:54.969
Above all else,
as British colonists you would

00:11:54.969 --> 00:11:59.644
of course consider yourselves to
be British subjects through and

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.268
through,
equal to all other British

00:12:02.268 --> 00:12:04.897
subjects,
even those living off in the

00:12:04.897 --> 00:12:06.548
east in the metropolis.
 

00:12:06.548 --> 00:12:09.826
You were a British subject and
you deserved the rights of a

00:12:09.826 --> 00:12:13.073
British subject,
but as a colonist living on the

00:12:13.073 --> 00:12:15.600
peripheries of the British
Empire,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.460
on the edge of what was
perceived at the time to be a

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.316
howling wilderness,
which is one of those great

00:12:21.316 --> 00:12:24.730
eighteenth-century ways of
referring to North America,

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.529
you also would be a little
nervous about your status as a

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:31.738
British subject,
worried about how you rated in

00:12:31.738 --> 00:12:35.831
comparison with people living in
the mother country at the center

00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:36.918
of the empire.
 

00:12:36.918 --> 00:12:41.090
Everything seemed more
sophisticated in England,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.668
and I suppose everything was
more sophisticated [laughs]

00:12:44.668 --> 00:12:46.836
in England,
but it definitely seemed that

00:12:46.836 --> 00:12:47.788
way to the colonists.
 

00:12:47.788 --> 00:12:49.830
The clothes were more
fashionable;

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.678
the homes were grander and more
stately;

00:12:52.678 --> 00:12:55.590
the intellectual life was rich
and challenging.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.989
In comparison with the
sophisticated people in England,

00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:02.451
you as a North American
colonist pretty much felt like a

00:13:02.451 --> 00:13:05.062
country bumpkin;
you felt kind of dull,

00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:07.028
kind of primitive,
somewhat rude,

00:13:07.028 --> 00:13:10.038
and certainly you felt
potentially irrelevant.

00:13:10.038 --> 00:13:12.979
You really did feel that you
were on the edge of a howling

00:13:12.979 --> 00:13:13.649
wilderness.
 

00:13:13.649 --> 00:13:16.227
So in essence,
like most British colonists in

00:13:16.227 --> 00:13:18.806
North America,
if you were there at the time,

00:13:18.806 --> 00:13:21.970
you would have had an ongoing
inferiority complex.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.942
Now there were a number of ways
in which you might deal with

00:13:26.942 --> 00:13:28.629
your insecurities.
 

00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:32.472
One way to deal with that would
have been to become really

00:13:32.472 --> 00:13:36.586
apologetic for what would have
been labeled as American speech

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:40.595
patterns or American manners,
and I've already given you one

00:13:40.595 --> 00:13:44.083
arrogant British quote by that
fellow on Tuesday who said that

00:13:44.083 --> 00:13:47.285
he was mortified that these
crude colonists spoke English

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:51.288
and could trace themselves to us
because they speak our language.

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:54.590
So that's sort of the ultimate
nasty stab at the colonists.

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.094
So you actually for good reason
might feel kind of embarrassed

00:13:58.094 --> 00:14:00.220
about your manners and your
speech.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.173
You probably would feel equally
embarrassed at the meanness of

00:14:03.173 --> 00:14:05.428
your architecture,
your buildings--they're smaller

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:07.410
and less impressive--
at the pallor of your

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.903
intellectual life,
at the relative unimportance of

00:14:10.903 --> 00:14:12.558
your public affairs.
 

00:14:12.558 --> 00:14:15.854
Like a lot of colonial writers
who wrote pamphlets or books

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.899
addressed to an English
audience,

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:21.365
you probably would apologize
for the poor quality of your

00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:24.562
work by reminding readers,
as one writer did,

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:28.620
"I live in the
uncultivated woods of America,

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:31.980
far from the fountains of
science and with but very rare

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.220
opportunities of conversing with
learned men."

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.460
That almost sounds like someone
who feels sorry for himself.

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.428
'I am so far from civilization.'
 

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:44.298
Or, you might boast about
colonial society,

00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:48.465
not claiming to be better than
the mother country but instead

00:14:48.465 --> 00:14:51.798
bragging that the colonies
represented Britain in

00:14:51.798 --> 00:14:54.239
miniature;
that colonial legislatures in

00:14:54.239 --> 00:14:56.620
this sense were kind of like
mini-Parliaments.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:01.750
Or, you might admit that the
colonies were different from

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:07.153
England but boast that in the
same way that England once had

00:15:07.153 --> 00:15:11.378
been pure and virtuous,
you in the colonies were

00:15:11.378 --> 00:15:14.357
maintaining the sort of pure,
virtuous England,

00:15:14.357 --> 00:15:17.219
and that England itself was
becoming corrupt and its cities

00:15:17.219 --> 00:15:20.485
were becoming cesspools,
but there in the colonies you

00:15:20.485 --> 00:15:23.278
were preserving the true British
heritage.

00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:29.178
Still, whichever you chose to
rationalize or understand your

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:33.390
status as a colonist,
you could not escape the fact

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.077
that you were a colonist and
that you were far away from the

00:15:37.077 --> 00:15:39.139
center of the civilized world.
 

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:42.379
As the young John Dickinson of
Pennsylvania put it,

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:44.751
and we're going to meet John
Dickinson again for sure later

00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:47.541
on in the course,
he wrote to his father while he

00:15:47.541 --> 00:15:51.484
was studying law in London and
he said that when colonists went

00:15:51.484 --> 00:15:55.109
to England and saw "the
difference between themselves

00:15:55.109 --> 00:15:59.370
and the polite part of the world
they must be miserable."

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:02.023
He actually thinks if
people--any colonist goes to

00:16:02.023 --> 00:16:05.490
London and sees what the polite
part of the world lives like,

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.462
they'll never be able to hold
their head up in the colonies

00:16:08.462 --> 00:16:09.129
ever again.
 

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:11.110
And Jefferson felt the same way.
 

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:14.610
Thomas Jefferson actually--as
much as he adored being

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:17.926
particularly in France,
he actually said more than once

00:16:17.926 --> 00:16:20.552
that he thought that young
American men should not be

00:16:20.552 --> 00:16:23.735
allowed to go to Europe because
if impressionable young men went

00:16:23.735 --> 00:16:26.513
to Europe they would be so
impressed by Paris and London

00:16:26.513 --> 00:16:29.240
that they would never be able to
hold their heads up in

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.009
Massachusetts or Virginia.
 

00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:33.937
It would look so puny and
insignificant in comparison that

00:16:33.937 --> 00:16:36.658
they would never be good
Americans ever again and that

00:16:36.658 --> 00:16:38.558
they'd have to go back to
Europe.

00:16:38.558 --> 00:16:43.168
Now of course the British
agreed generally with this

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:46.149
assessment of colonial society.
 

00:16:46.149 --> 00:16:50.566
Colonists obviously were
inferior and rough and rustic

00:16:50.566 --> 00:16:52.427
and crude,
so as promised,

00:16:52.427 --> 00:16:55.379
here is yet another arrogant
British quote in my series of

00:16:55.379 --> 00:16:56.779
arrogant British quotes.
 

00:16:56.779 --> 00:16:59.740
In this case one British
observer noted,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:04.127
"American colonists may
try to ape British habits and

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:08.440
customs but they're no more than
ruffled dunces."

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.749
I just think there's--these
guys have a real vim and vigor

00:17:11.749 --> 00:17:15.000
for finding the little zippy,
stingy, nasty statement.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.713
I think "ruffled
dunces" is a pretty good

00:17:16.713 --> 00:17:16.920
one.
 

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.272
"What else could be
expected from aggrandized

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:23.969
upstarts in those infant
countries of America who never

00:17:23.969 --> 00:17:27.342
have an opportunity to see,
or if they had,

00:17:27.342 --> 00:17:32.229
the opportunity to observe the
different ranks of men in polite

00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:33.568
nations?"
 

00:17:33.568 --> 00:17:35.598
Notice how the colonies are
never polite.

00:17:35.598 --> 00:17:37.260
[laughs]
There are the polite nations,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.000
and then there's these scary,
howling wilderness colonists.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.710
Along these same lines,
there's actually another

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.166
professor here at Yale,
Kariann Yokota,

00:17:45.166 --> 00:17:47.967
and some of her work shows--
I found this really

00:17:47.967 --> 00:17:50.661
fascinating--that the British
regularly sent damaged or

00:17:50.661 --> 00:17:53.355
second-rate goods to the
colonists because they figured

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:55.750
the colonists wouldn't know the
difference.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.241
They just kept the first-rate
stuff for themselves,

00:17:58.241 --> 00:17:58.990
like: Broken?
 

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:01.309
Massachusetts.
 

00:18:01.309 --> 00:18:03.549
[laughs] They'll never know.
 

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:04.920
Last week's, last year's style?
 

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.490
Massachusetts.
 

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.262
So basically all of this shows
that if Americans had an

00:18:10.262 --> 00:18:12.729
inferiority complex,
they had some reason to have

00:18:12.729 --> 00:18:13.140
one.
 

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.336
Now let me add at this point
that this anxiety about how the

00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:20.608
colonists rated in comparison
with England,

00:18:20.608 --> 00:18:23.450
specifically in Europe,
the polite world,

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.950
generally doesn't end with the
Revolution.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:28.288
It's not as though suddenly we
win the Revolution and we don't

00:18:28.288 --> 00:18:30.130
really care what the rest of the
world thinks.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.325
Even after the colonies and
then the states had fought and

00:18:33.325 --> 00:18:36.800
defeated the great power of the
British empire and successfully

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.098
created a new national
constitution,

00:18:39.098 --> 00:18:42.318
Americans were still worried
about looking sophisticated

00:18:42.318 --> 00:18:44.308
enough in the eyes of the world.
 

00:18:44.308 --> 00:18:47.250
And my favorite example of
this--It's a little bit down the

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.243
road from the moment that we're
at in this course but I just

00:18:50.243 --> 00:18:52.730
can't resist adding it in
because it's just--

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.250
it makes me happy and it's John
Adams--

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:57.430
and it's actually from 1789.
 

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.737
It's right when this new
national Constitution has gone

00:19:00.737 --> 00:19:04.352
into effect and the Senate is
debating what the title should

00:19:04.352 --> 00:19:06.680
be for the new national
executive.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:06.840
Right?
 

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.190
We know there's going to be a
national executive.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:09.630
We don't know what we're going
to call him.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.828
And so the Senate is debating
this,

00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:13.700
and someone in the Senate says,
"Well,

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:16.598
why don't we call him President
of the United States?"

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:17.045
Okay.
 

00:19:17.045 --> 00:19:21.858
This horrifies John Adams,
absolutely horrifies him,

00:19:21.858 --> 00:19:24.828
and as he says at the time--He
says,

00:19:24.828 --> 00:19:27.090
"For God's sake,
there are presidents of cricket

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:27.700
clubs."
 

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.938
[laughs]
President of the United States:

00:19:29.938 --> 00:19:31.890
and I'll quote him exactly
here.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.192
He does say there are
presidents of cricket clubs but

00:19:34.192 --> 00:19:37.464
he says in the Senate--
Where is it here?--"What

00:19:37.464 --> 00:19:40.900
will the common people of
foreign countries,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.338
what will the sailors and
soldiers say?

00:19:44.338 --> 00:19:48.118
George Washington,
President of the United States?

00:19:48.118 --> 00:19:51.059
They will despise him to all
eternity."

00:19:51.059 --> 00:19:53.108
[laughter] Right?
 

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:56.007
So Adams is thinking in a world
where you have His Royal

00:19:56.007 --> 00:19:57.978
Highness,
protector of the realm:

00:19:57.978 --> 00:19:59.900
President of the United
States--

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.009
he's just thinking that there's
no comparison;

00:20:02.009 --> 00:20:03.788
it doesn't rank.
 

00:20:03.788 --> 00:20:07.519
So as we're going to be seeing
in future weeks of this course,

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:10.920
there's a constant thinking
about what--

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.380
how we are being looked upon
and that doesn't go away.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.501
It shifts, it's different,
but it remains for quite some

00:20:16.501 --> 00:20:16.900
time.
 

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.048
America in one way or another
always assumes they're being

00:20:20.048 --> 00:20:21.210
watched and judged.
 

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:24.240
In the 1760s,
we'll see soon how these sort

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.137
of colonial feelings of
inferiority would help fuel the

00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:31.891
hypersensitivity of the
colonists to infringements on

00:20:31.891 --> 00:20:34.848
their rights by the mother
country.

00:20:34.848 --> 00:20:38.904
Now despite all of this
anxiety, all of this inferiority

00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:41.779
complex that I'm talking about
here,

00:20:41.779 --> 00:20:45.661
as a colonist you did share a
base of assumptions and values

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:48.029
with your counterparts in
England.

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:51.442
So, first of all,
as an individual you assumed

00:20:51.442 --> 00:20:54.400
that you lived in a great
hierarchy,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.180
a sort of natural order,
everyone in his or her place,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.440
deferent to those that were
beneath you,

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.772
respected but--I'm
sorry--deferent to those above

00:21:02.772 --> 00:21:04.262
you--
That's a nifty order,

00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:06.700
to be deferent to those beneath
you and respected.

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.038
You would be respectful to
those above,

00:21:09.038 --> 00:21:11.568
and people below you would be
deferential to you,

00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:14.315
so basically everyone is in
their place and everybody is

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:16.760
acting respectful and
deferential as they properly

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.397
should,
and this--you'll see a lot of

00:21:18.397 --> 00:21:19.150
this in Gordon Wood.
 

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:21.652
Now of course the American
version of this great social

00:21:21.652 --> 00:21:23.551
order,
this great hierarchy,

00:21:23.551 --> 00:21:27.787
is different in some ways from
its British equivalent because

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.740
the colonies lacked both the
top-most and the bottom-most

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.068
rungs of society in England.
 

00:21:34.068 --> 00:21:38.518
So in the colonies there wasn't
a titled entrenched aristocracy

00:21:38.518 --> 00:21:41.890
and there wasn't an entrenched
peasant class.

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.828
Instead the colonies had what
some called a middling society

00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:51.348
which was populated mostly by
either middling folk,

00:21:51.348 --> 00:21:54.616
logically enough,
who had migrated from England

00:21:54.616 --> 00:21:59.430
to better their lot in life,
by the English poor who hoped

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:03.508
to better themselves,
and by some of the lower ranks

00:22:03.508 --> 00:22:07.593
of the English gentry like third
or fourth sons of the English

00:22:07.593 --> 00:22:09.643
gentry,
who basically knew they weren't

00:22:09.643 --> 00:22:12.016
going to inherit anything in
England and so their thought

00:22:12.016 --> 00:22:14.115
was: well,
maybe if I head out to the

00:22:14.115 --> 00:22:15.922
colonies I--
it'll be easier for me to get

00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:17.778
some land there;
I'll be able to better myself;

00:22:17.778 --> 00:22:22.413
I'll be able to basically make
something of myself there easier

00:22:22.413 --> 00:22:23.759
than I can here.
 

00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:27.455
Now if you were thinking about
going to the colonies and you

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:31.680
really wanted to get rich quick,
the West Indies was the place

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.932
to go,
though it also offered some of

00:22:33.932 --> 00:22:36.753
the absolute worst living
conditions in the British

00:22:36.753 --> 00:22:37.769
colonial world.
 

00:22:37.769 --> 00:22:39.990
Life there was extremely hard.
 

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.068
There was unbearable heat.
 

00:22:42.068 --> 00:22:46.680
All energies were focused on
gaining money and little else.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.472
West Indian planters were so
focused on money,

00:22:49.472 --> 00:22:51.769
money crops,
they actually didn't even

00:22:51.769 --> 00:22:53.880
bother to grow their own food.
 

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.278
They imported food because they
didn't want to waste land,

00:22:57.278 --> 00:23:00.259
energy, and resources on
growing their own food.

00:23:00.259 --> 00:23:02.390
They were really focused on
their money crop.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.578
If you went to the Indies to
get rich quick,

00:23:05.578 --> 00:23:09.930
typically you either made it
big or failed miserably,

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:12.174
and either way typically what
happened is you would go to the

00:23:12.174 --> 00:23:13.849
Indies,
you would establish a

00:23:13.849 --> 00:23:16.390
plantation, you would find an
overseer,

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:19.413
you would put him in charge,
and then you would flee back to

00:23:19.413 --> 00:23:22.384
England and be an absentee
landlord and let the people live

00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:25.356
in misery in the West Indies
while you collected the profit

00:23:25.356 --> 00:23:27.920
off of your sugar crop back home
in England.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.705
Now the Indies,
not surprisingly,

00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:31.660
might seem a little
intimidating.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.871
If you wanted to get rich
quick, you might choose not to

00:23:33.871 --> 00:23:35.358
go down to the scary sugar
islands.

00:23:35.358 --> 00:23:39.361
You might decide instead to go
to the southern colonies to get

00:23:39.361 --> 00:23:42.468
rich quick,
and for example it was largely

00:23:42.468 --> 00:23:46.846
sons of the lesser gentry in
England who went to Jamestown at

00:23:46.846 --> 00:23:50.640
the start of the seventeenth
century in Virginia.

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.993
And, logically enough,
since these are sons of the

00:23:52.993 --> 00:23:55.780
lesser gentry and they consider
themselves to be above hard

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.045
labor,
they show up to this rather

00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:00.358
primitive new colony in
Jamestown,

00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:04.460
they refuse to work to grow
their own food,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.640
and they starve to death.
 

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.619
[laughs]
That's a serious commitment to

00:24:08.619 --> 00:24:09.348
your status.
 

00:24:09.348 --> 00:24:10.082
'I'm sorry.
 

00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:11.280
I'm above plowing.
 

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:12.880
I'm going to die now.'
 

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.835
[laughter]
You think sooner or later they

00:24:14.835 --> 00:24:16.839
kind of figure:
a little plowing--life.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:18.730
It's kind of--I don't know.
 

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.828
At any rate,
there's a reason why Jamestown

00:24:20.828 --> 00:24:24.891
didn't do so well and there's--
a great example of this weird

00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:29.788
mentality is Nathaniel Bacon,
who is a gentile colonist.

00:24:29.788 --> 00:24:33.224
He's a younger son of a member
of the British gentry and in the

00:24:33.224 --> 00:24:35.828
seventeenth century sure enough
he migrates,

00:24:35.828 --> 00:24:38.673
he ends up in Virginia,
and he arrives in Virginia like

00:24:38.673 --> 00:24:41.358
a lot of people assuming that he
deserved power,

00:24:41.358 --> 00:24:43.598
he deserved land,
and he deserved status.

00:24:43.598 --> 00:24:46.188
He's among the lesser gentry
but he still is among the upper

00:24:46.188 --> 00:24:48.690
crust in England and now he's
arriving among the rude,

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:50.910
ruffled dunces [laughs]
of the colonies.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.538
He assumes he's someone who
deserves what he wants.

00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:56.144
Lo and behold,
he gets there and he finds that

00:24:56.144 --> 00:24:59.788
actually in Virginia there's a
kind of an inner core of men,

00:24:59.788 --> 00:25:02.568
self-made men,
who had been there for awhile,

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:04.269
or their families had been
there for awhile,

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.868
and basically they controlled
most of the land,

00:25:06.868 --> 00:25:09.380
they controlled most of the
government offices,

00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:12.503
they had most of the power,
and thus they could exclude

00:25:12.503 --> 00:25:15.338
Bacon and others from getting
what they wanted.

00:25:15.338 --> 00:25:18.883
Bacon obviously is a person
who's much more interested in

00:25:18.883 --> 00:25:22.742
making money than in the good of
the colony so he responded to

00:25:22.742 --> 00:25:26.286
his frustration at not being
able to get land or power by

00:25:26.286 --> 00:25:29.955
surrounding himself with a pack
of equally-frustrated angry

00:25:29.955 --> 00:25:33.880
young men who also wanted land
and also wanted power,

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:36.451
and eventually they came up
with the brilliant idea that

00:25:36.451 --> 00:25:38.788
they would stage an enormous
attack on Indians,

00:25:38.788 --> 00:25:41.049
massacre them all and steal
their land.

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:43.308
Brilliant plot.
 

00:25:43.308 --> 00:25:47.250
So Bacon and his pack of guys
sort of go off and actually

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:48.868
start this in action.
 

00:25:48.868 --> 00:25:52.970
The governor of the colony sees
that this is rapidly spinning

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:55.430
out of control and becoming
wild,

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.305
crazy Indian warfare so he
tries to stifle it and Nathaniel

00:25:59.305 --> 00:26:03.580
Bacon and his friends did what I
suppose appeared logical to them

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.650
at the time.
 

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:08.670
They burned Jamestown to the
ground because they were angry.

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:11.400
[laughs]
Well, that's serious anger.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.579
'Oh, you're going to stop us?
 

00:26:12.579 --> 00:26:14.589
We'll just destroy the capital.'
 

00:26:14.589 --> 00:26:17.390
[laughter] 'You're gone.'
 

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.356
Now the story is kind of
anticlimactic because Bacon

00:26:20.356 --> 00:26:23.614
ultimately dies miserably of
dysentery while running away

00:26:23.614 --> 00:26:26.756
from authorities so there's not
a lot of glory [laughs]

00:26:26.756 --> 00:26:30.304
in Bacon's ultimate end,
but he's definitely a really

00:26:30.304 --> 00:26:33.544
good example of greedy
self-interest and of the sense

00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:37.344
of deservedness because of his
social rank and this disgust at

00:26:37.344 --> 00:26:40.460
the power of these self-made men
in Virginia.

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.108
There were some gentry who
would have migrated to the

00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:46.319
colonies who would have had some
kind of a similar feeling about

00:26:46.319 --> 00:26:48.410
what they saw and what they
expected.

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:52.077
But the gentry was only a
minority of the people who

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:54.019
migrated to the colonies.
 

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:57.977
Most were lower in status,
some were of the lowest rank of

00:26:57.977 --> 00:27:01.240
all, landless people and
sometimes criminals.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.490
So if you committed a crime in
England,

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:07.022
you might be offered the option
between prison in England and

00:27:07.022 --> 00:27:10.441
being sent to the colonies,
and to some this was actually a

00:27:10.441 --> 00:27:11.452
really hard choice.
 

00:27:11.452 --> 00:27:11.880
Right?
 

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.089
'Prison, the colonies,
prison, the colonies.

00:27:15.089 --> 00:27:16.740
I don't know.'
 

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:18.230
The howling wilderness was very
scary.

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.240
Now some people opted for the
howling wilderness,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.788
obviously, and some people,
poorer people,

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:28.140
decided to take their chances
on the colonies,

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.642
sold themselves into servitude
as indentured servants for five

00:27:31.642 --> 00:27:35.250
to seven years at a time,
and in exchange their passage

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:37.709
was paid,
they owed a certain amount of

00:27:37.709 --> 00:27:39.925
work,
and at the end of their time of

00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:42.490
indenture they would get some
plot of land.

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:44.700
So there were a good number of
indentured servants,

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.954
and as a matter of fact some of
those Virginia power mongers who

00:27:47.954 --> 00:27:50.538
were blocking Bacon out had
started out actually as

00:27:50.538 --> 00:27:51.779
indentured servants.
 

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:54.318
That's--When you talk self-made
you're really talking self-made,

00:27:54.318 --> 00:27:55.680
people who came,
did their indenture,

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.930
got some land and then really
built their way up.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:03.948
So self-improvement obviously
is one reason to head to the

00:28:03.948 --> 00:28:05.108
colonies.
 

00:28:05.108 --> 00:28:07.669
Another reason,
another thing that might drive

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:11.612
you to head off to the colonies,
would have been if you belonged

00:28:11.612 --> 00:28:15.518
to a religious minority that was
seemingly increasing unpopular

00:28:15.518 --> 00:28:16.400
in England.
 

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.220
So if you were a Puritan,
if you were a Quaker,

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:22.327
if you were Catholic,
again probably middling in

00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:24.548
status,
you might decide to try your

00:28:24.548 --> 00:28:27.666
luck in the colonies where
either you thought there might

00:28:27.666 --> 00:28:31.183
be more religious tolerance,
or just as likely there'd be

00:28:31.183 --> 00:28:34.902
land so empty of people that it
wouldn't really be a worry of

00:28:34.902 --> 00:28:35.460
yours.
 

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.881
There wouldn't be people around
there to be intolerant of you

00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:39.980
and so it probably would be
better than what you were

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.108
experiencing in England.
 

00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:43.461
Obviously, a lot of New England
was settled by Puritans with

00:28:43.461 --> 00:28:44.058
that mindset.
 

00:28:44.058 --> 00:28:48.400
Pennsylvania had the Quaker
faith at its cure--at its core.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:51.724
It was founded by William Penn,
who was actually a member of

00:28:51.724 --> 00:28:52.740
the aristocracy.
 

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.960
He became a Quaker and then he
used his high connections to get

00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.180
a royal charter from the King to
found a colony for Quakers.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.595
And Maryland began as a place
that was distinctly friendly to

00:29:04.595 --> 00:29:06.358
people of the Catholic faith.
 

00:29:06.358 --> 00:29:09.678
Now out of all of these kinds
of colonists that I'm talking

00:29:09.678 --> 00:29:12.858
about here,
what was missing was a titled,

00:29:12.858 --> 00:29:16.925
sort of to-the-manor-born,
established aristocracy of

00:29:16.925 --> 00:29:21.400
dukes and duchesses unshakably
of the highest rank in society.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.038
This doesn't mean that colonial
society didn't have an

00:29:25.038 --> 00:29:28.246
established elite,
because certainly every colony

00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:31.660
had certain great families that
controlled large amounts of

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.720
power and land.
 

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.200
And as a colonist,
and an average colonist,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.830
you would have had no problem
differentiating these gentlefolk

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.664
from the common masses--
right?--these sort of gentlemen

00:29:42.664 --> 00:29:43.369
and gentlewomen.
 

00:29:43.369 --> 00:29:45.788
They dressed differently;
they held themselves

00:29:45.788 --> 00:29:47.828
differently;
they spoke differently;

00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:51.298
you addressed these people by
Mister or Madame or Esquire.

00:29:51.298 --> 00:29:55.332
You actually visibly could tell
who the sort of upper-crust

00:29:55.332 --> 00:29:57.068
people in society were.
 

00:29:57.068 --> 00:30:00.814
Some families held obvious
power but again not in the

00:30:00.814 --> 00:30:04.990
unquestionable way that the
aristocracy remained in control

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.068
in England.
 

00:30:06.068 --> 00:30:09.423
A lot of these people that I
just mentioned had worked their

00:30:09.423 --> 00:30:11.470
way into positions of
prominence,

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:15.884
so ultimately the line dividing
sort of upper-crusty people from

00:30:15.884 --> 00:30:19.598
less upper-crusty people was
less sort of absolute.

00:30:19.598 --> 00:30:23.002
It was less distinct than it
would have been in a country or

00:30:23.002 --> 00:30:26.578
in a place where there was a
really established aristocracy.

00:30:26.578 --> 00:30:29.079
So basically even though you
could tell who the elite are and

00:30:29.079 --> 00:30:31.498
you could tell who the masses
are, there is slippage up and

00:30:31.498 --> 00:30:32.538
down between the two.
 

00:30:32.538 --> 00:30:34.965
It's not as though there is a
dividing line and you could

00:30:34.965 --> 00:30:36.569
never hope to become an
aristocrat.

00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:39.140
It's a little blurrier;
it's again a middling society;

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:40.529
it's part of what that means.
 

00:30:40.529 --> 00:30:44.165
And because of that,
things like formal titles and

00:30:44.165 --> 00:30:48.618
fine clothing were of extreme
importance in the colonies--

00:30:48.618 --> 00:30:51.516
and in a lot of ways more
important in the colonies than

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:54.279
they were in England--
because they really were ways

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:57.333
of proving your status in a
place where you felt the need to

00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.420
prove your status.
 

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.123
If you think about it,
your status would have been

00:31:01.123 --> 00:31:03.108
just a matter of common
agreement.

00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:06.092
You were only as lofty in
status as people believed you

00:31:06.092 --> 00:31:09.183
were and if someone felt
compelled to call you by a title

00:31:09.183 --> 00:31:12.332
or if you were wearing fine
clothing that people knew they

00:31:12.332 --> 00:31:15.616
themselves couldn't afford,
that could go a long way

00:31:15.616 --> 00:31:18.960
towards convincing people of
your status and importance.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.615
So for example,
if you had any military service

00:31:22.615 --> 00:31:24.358
at all,
even for the briefest moment

00:31:24.358 --> 00:31:26.838
you'd served in the military,
and you were an officer,

00:31:26.838 --> 00:31:30.532
you would insist forever after
to the end of your days that you

00:31:30.532 --> 00:31:33.808
be called always by your title
like Colonel So-and-So or

00:31:33.808 --> 00:31:35.180
Captain So-and-So.
 

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:38.000
That military title counted for
a lot.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.107
That was really a sort of
unquestioned symbol of rank and

00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:43.488
authority,
and in fact some people joined

00:31:43.488 --> 00:31:46.858
the military just because they
knew by doing so they would get

00:31:46.858 --> 00:31:50.286
a title and then they would be
able to hang on to that title to

00:31:50.286 --> 00:31:53.160
really claim a place for
themselves in society.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:58.185
And when I was researching my
first book I came across a case

00:31:58.185 --> 00:32:02.541
where there were these two
guys--it sounds like a bad

00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:05.140
joke--two guys in a tavern.
 

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.965
There were these two guys in a
tavern and one of them is a

00:32:07.965 --> 00:32:10.048
military officer and one of them
isn't,

00:32:10.048 --> 00:32:12.957
and I guess the guy who wasn't
a military officer wasn't so

00:32:12.957 --> 00:32:15.865
clear on the whole rank thing
and he called the fellow by a

00:32:15.865 --> 00:32:17.568
lower rank than he was:
well,

00:32:17.568 --> 00:32:19.880
Captain Something instead of
Colonel Something--

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:23.419
and the guy was so insulted
that his title had been lowered

00:32:23.419 --> 00:32:27.262
by who-the- hell-was-this-person
that he actually challenged him

00:32:27.262 --> 00:32:28.848
to a duel right there.
 

00:32:28.848 --> 00:32:30.380
'I'm sorry, but I'm willing to
kill you now.'

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.295
[laughs]
'You called me Captain.

00:32:33.295 --> 00:32:34.328
You die.'
 

00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:35.269
[laughter]
It was a serious insult,

00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:37.484
a dread insult--and also he
might have just been a crazy

00:32:37.484 --> 00:32:38.548
person but--
[laughs]

00:32:38.548 --> 00:32:41.484
That's possible too,
but still it actually was a

00:32:41.484 --> 00:32:42.608
serious insult.
 

00:32:42.608 --> 00:32:47.048
And because military titles and
status went hand in hand,

00:32:47.048 --> 00:32:50.403
sometimes strangers who seemed
to be high-ranking were just

00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:53.525
called Colonel or General
because they seemed important

00:32:53.525 --> 00:32:56.068
and thus they must have a
military rank.

00:32:56.068 --> 00:32:59.567
And I actually found a diary of
someone, this sort of member of

00:32:59.567 --> 00:33:02.671
the South Carolina elite,
and he was wandering around in

00:33:02.671 --> 00:33:03.798
the backcountry.
 

00:33:03.798 --> 00:33:07.500
And he says in his diary,
no matter where he went,

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.944
he was called Colonel,
which amazed him because he

00:33:09.944 --> 00:33:12.940
said not only had he never had
any military service but --

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.767
and I don't know what this
means; I don't know enough about

00:33:14.767 --> 00:33:16.104
him to know--
but he kept saying over and

00:33:16.104 --> 00:33:18.366
over again,
'I really don't look like a

00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:20.661
military person,
nothing about me,' so I'm

00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:23.242
imagining this sort of sloppy,
scary guy who's wandering

00:33:23.242 --> 00:33:26.080
around in the back country of
South Carolina and people are

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.025
saying,
'Colonel,' [laughs],--wow--and

00:33:28.025 --> 00:33:29.289
people usually loved that.
 

00:33:29.289 --> 00:33:30.190
This made him happy.
 

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:32.660
He wrote about it in his diary
because he liked it so much;

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:34.880
this made him a happy guy.
 

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.622
So obviously titles,
status, they're important and

00:33:37.622 --> 00:33:38.910
they go hand in hand.
 

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:42.608
Now if you were in college in
the colonies--

00:33:42.608 --> 00:33:44.430
so if you were at Yale,
if you were at Harvard,

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:47.240
if you were at King's College,
which is now Columbia--

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:51.201
these kinds of distinctions of
rank and status would have been

00:33:51.201 --> 00:33:54.733
a part of your everyday life,
because when you entered

00:33:54.733 --> 00:33:58.067
college you were listed as a
member of your class in the

00:33:58.067 --> 00:33:59.644
order of your social rank.
 

00:33:59.644 --> 00:34:00.190
Okay.
 

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.851
So the person of the highest
social rank is listed at the top

00:34:02.851 --> 00:34:05.599
of the class and the person of
the lowest social rank is listed

00:34:05.599 --> 00:34:08.550
at the bottom of the class,
and at commencement ceremonies

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.561
or graduation ceremonies the
highest in rank was the one who

00:34:11.561 --> 00:34:14.164
got to speak the longest and
give the longest public

00:34:14.164 --> 00:34:16.250
address--
and obviously because,

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.780
as I've been saying,
things are less entrenched,

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.630
what this meant was lots of
really petty,

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:23.858
nasty squabbling at a lot of
universities because everybody

00:34:23.858 --> 00:34:24.860
had a complaint.
 

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.670
'Well, I'm not on the bottom.
 

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:27.150
Well, I certainly have a better
rank than him.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:28.380
He should be at the
bottom.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:31.135
I should be at the--'
So certainly it's a contentious

00:34:31.135 --> 00:34:33.373
issue at colleges,
and what this meant,

00:34:33.373 --> 00:34:35.489
oddly enough,
is that when the grading

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:37.380
system--
when people actually figured

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.719
out that you could have a
grading system and base--

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.762
judge people based on grades,
then unbelievably this was seen

00:34:43.762 --> 00:34:45.110
as a great relief.
 

00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:47.179
This made people really--Grades
made people really,

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.021
really happy,
because it meant that you could

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:54.219
be judged based on merit and not
based on rank or social class.

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:57.500
So you can give thanks to the
democracy of grades.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:59.369
Remember that during this
semester.

00:34:59.369 --> 00:35:00.900
I'll remind you.
 

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.378
Give thanks for your grades.
 

00:35:03.378 --> 00:35:03.909
Okay.
 

00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:07.706
So we've talked about some of
the similarities and differences

00:35:07.706 --> 00:35:11.690
in social rank between colonists
and people living in England.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:14.835
I want to just take a few
minutes to talk about some

00:35:14.835 --> 00:35:17.860
assumptions about government and
about rights,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.202
about individual rights,
because one of the periods of

00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:24.297
great migration to the colonies,
which was the

00:35:24.297 --> 00:35:28.360
mid-to-late-seventeenth century,
was also a period in which

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.440
Parliament asserted its
dominance in England.

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.929
So while all Englishmen
believed in the importance of

00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:36.371
political liberty and
legislative representation and

00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:39.197
the rule of law and all of these
things I've started to talk

00:35:39.197 --> 00:35:41.163
about,
the colonies were full of

00:35:41.163 --> 00:35:44.496
people who either themselves had
left England or were descended

00:35:44.496 --> 00:35:47.882
from people who had left England
when that kind of belief was at

00:35:47.882 --> 00:35:51.036
an all-time high,
so colonial governments

00:35:51.036 --> 00:35:55.119
embodied that spirit to a really
extreme degree.

00:35:55.119 --> 00:35:59.184
And it's important to realize
that colonial talk of liberty

00:35:59.184 --> 00:36:02.130
wasn't some kind of colonial
innovation.

00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.230
It was the most heartfelt of
British traditions --

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.719
as I've suggested just in this
lecture,

00:36:06.719 --> 00:36:08.719
and as we're going to see in
future weeks--

00:36:08.719 --> 00:36:12.431
it's the precise meaning of
liberty as translated into the

00:36:12.431 --> 00:36:15.672
colonies from England--
and as this slowly shifts over

00:36:15.672 --> 00:36:17.864
time,
it's going to help raise

00:36:17.864 --> 00:36:21.949
conflict between the colonies
and the mother country.

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:25.179
But questions about the precise
meaning of liberty wouldn't

00:36:25.179 --> 00:36:27.518
really become an issue until the
1760s,

00:36:27.518 --> 00:36:30.768
after the French and Indian War
when,

00:36:30.768 --> 00:36:33.141
as we'll soon see,
the British would end what had

00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:35.711
been a long period of what's
often called a period of

00:36:35.711 --> 00:36:38.237
salutary neglect,
a period when the British

00:36:38.237 --> 00:36:41.750
largely just left the colonies
alone to regulate themselves.

00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:45.052
And throughout that period of
neglect colonists had lived

00:36:45.052 --> 00:36:48.590
immersed in their sense of
English rights and privileges,

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:51.590
unaware of the ways in which
the colonial experience--

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.349
just the experience of living
in the colonies--

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:57.840
had suddenly altered their
understanding of these rights.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.128
They've been able to live in
that kind of a freedom largely

00:37:01.128 --> 00:37:04.699
because of the nature of the
British imperial administration.

00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:07.827
Typically, rather than exerting
great control over the

00:37:07.827 --> 00:37:10.956
colonization process the British
Crown tended to leave

00:37:10.956 --> 00:37:13.789
colonization largely to private
enterprise,

00:37:13.789 --> 00:37:17.733
so like a joint-stock company
would get a grant to establish a

00:37:17.733 --> 00:37:19.226
colony,
and off they'd go,

00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:21.577
and it wasn't really
necessarily the Crown that had

00:37:21.577 --> 00:37:22.800
its hand on everything.
 

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.385
It was these private companies
that were often taking care of

00:37:26.385 --> 00:37:29.898
the colonization efforts,
and on a few occasions when the

00:37:29.898 --> 00:37:33.518
Crown did pass trade regulations
they didn't enforce them very

00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:35.748
rigorously,
which basically allowed

00:37:35.748 --> 00:37:37.730
widespread smuggling and
bribery.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.809
So in a sense,
the success of the British

00:37:40.809 --> 00:37:45.197
imperial system up until the
1760s was largely due to what

00:37:45.197 --> 00:37:49.396
was not really a policy,
but the absence of a

00:37:49.396 --> 00:37:52.795
policy--right?--
this neglect of the colonies by

00:37:52.795 --> 00:37:53.909
the mother country.
 

00:37:53.909 --> 00:37:57.505
Not until the British began to
actively regulate the colonies

00:37:57.505 --> 00:38:00.980
in the mid-eighteenth century
did it really become apparent

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.635
that colonial and British ideas
about the role of the colonies

00:38:04.635 --> 00:38:08.590
and the rights of colonists had
really begun to drift apart.

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:12.213
Had the colonists forfeited
some of their English liberties

00:38:12.213 --> 00:38:14.650
by migrating to the New World or
not?

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:18.068
Were they dependent on the
mother country or were they just

00:38:18.068 --> 00:38:20.250
contributors to the greater
empire?

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.278
And some colonists would come
to have a clear answer to those

00:38:23.278 --> 00:38:24.340
kinds of questions.
 

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.614
They would argue--and we're
going to see this in weeks to

00:38:26.614 --> 00:38:28.726
come,
and specifically people writing

00:38:28.726 --> 00:38:31.380
this argument and offering it to
the public--

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:35.106
that the original settlers of
the colonies had been free-born

00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:38.956
subjects of England who had left
England with the authorization

00:38:38.956 --> 00:38:41.951
of the monarchy and,
taking a good many personal

00:38:41.951 --> 00:38:44.940
risks, had created thriving
English settlements at little

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.677
cost to the English government,
bringing England great riches

00:38:48.677 --> 00:38:49.710
in the process.
 

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.025
So essentially some colonists
would argue not only were they

00:38:53.025 --> 00:38:56.230
English, but they made personal
sacrifices for England;

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.985
they had tamed a wilderness for
England, for the sake of the

00:38:59.985 --> 00:39:00.559
empire.
 

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:03.579
And ironically it would be that
mentality--

00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:06.389
that kind of outcry for the
rights of Englishmen--

00:39:06.389 --> 00:39:09.800
that would help lead the
colonists to revolt against

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:10.469
England.
 

00:39:10.469 --> 00:39:12.896
As we'll see,
in a sense, the colonies were

00:39:12.896 --> 00:39:16.130
never as English as when they
rebelled against the mother

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.500
country for the rights of
Englishmen.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.920
And I will stop there.
 

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.014
On Tuesday we will be looking
at some things that were

00:39:24.014 --> 00:39:27.050
distinctly American about the
colonial experience.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.980
Have a good weekend.
 

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.000

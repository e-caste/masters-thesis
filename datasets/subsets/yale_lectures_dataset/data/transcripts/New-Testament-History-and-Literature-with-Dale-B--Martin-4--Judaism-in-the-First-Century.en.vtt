00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.540
Prof: The chronological
end of the Old Testament,

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.249
Hebrew Bible,
takes place in the sixth

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.060
century BCE that is in the 500s
BCE.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.423
I say the chronological end of
the text is that because that's

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:20.500
actually not the latest that our
literature comes from.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.690
It's just that's the end of the
story.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.810
What happens basically is that
the Jews are taken out of Judea,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.450
they're taken into captivity,
or at least the upper class is,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.066
in Babylon, and then they wait
70 years and then they're

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.547
brought--
they're allowed to come back

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:40.440
into Judea to rebuild the temple
and the walls of Jerusalem,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.270
and it's the rebuilding of the
temple and the walls of

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.680
Jerusalem that are narrated in
the books Ezra and Nehemiah.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.474
That's kind of where the story
of the Jews or the Israelites

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:57.050
ends, at the end of the sixth
century BCE.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.950
That's not actually the latest
document because,

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.079
as we'll talk about a little
bit later today,

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.920
the book of Daniel,
which claims of course to be

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.581
written in Babylon,
Babylonian captivity,

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:11.578
but also by a guy named Daniel
who lived in the sixth century.

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:16.046
It's actually not written then,
it's written around the year of

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:18.500
164 BCE,
so that's the latest document

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.305
that we have that's in the
Hebrew Bible or the Old

00:01:21.305 --> 00:01:22.049
Testament.
 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.254
So there's a difference in the
actual timing of the documents

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:29.129
and the chronological end of the
story.

00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:31.369
I'll remind you of what we
talked about last time with

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.060
Alexander the Great just very
briefly.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.354
Alexander the Great,
remember, wanted to set up a

00:01:36.354 --> 00:01:38.550
one world, a universal empire.
 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.019
He taught a sort of syncretism
of religion,

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:44.459
he taught a common language,
Greek,

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.220
he set up these Greek cities
all around,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.330
these things will all be very
important for us.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.910
That process is what we call
Hellenization,

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.727
so the Hellenization of the
world in that time means that we

00:01:55.727 --> 00:01:58.510
even call that period
Hellenistic Greek,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.709
the Hellenistic Period.
 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.530
To differentiate it from
classical Greek period,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.358
say classical Athens in the
sixth and fifth century,

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:09.180
and then the Greco Roman Period
which will come later,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.658
the period of Rome.
 

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:13.711
The reason Hellenism is so
important for us is because

00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.878
Alexander--what happened to his
empire after he died.

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:20.354
After much confusion and
fighting among his major

00:02:20.354 --> 00:02:24.262
generals, after his death,
Alexander's kingdom ended up

00:02:24.262 --> 00:02:27.520
being divided up into four major
empires.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.459
For our purposes only three of
those really matter,

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.318
and on your handout you'll see
the names Seleucus,

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:37.919
Antiochus, and the Seleucids.
 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.589
Seleucus was one of the
Generals of Alexander and he

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:46.410
ended up getting the part of his
empire that had been Babylonia,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.690
that is modern day Iraq,
and Syria.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.706
What happens is,
you'll find over and over

00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:57.175
again,
a man named Seleucus will have

00:02:57.175 --> 00:03:00.387
a kid named maybe Antiochus,
who will have a kid named

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:01.687
Seleucus,
who will have a kid named

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:02.030
Antiochus.
 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.360
The Seleucids is what we call
their dynasty,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.195
their family name,
they tended to use those two

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.538
names Seleucus and Antiochus a
lot,

00:03:09.538 --> 00:03:12.110
so you'll see just Seleucus I,
II, III;

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:13.560
Antiochus I, II, III, and IV.
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.256
Those two names were used
quite--in their family over and

00:03:16.256 --> 00:03:18.171
over again,
so it gets very confusing in

00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:20.877
historical literature when it's
hard to keep them straight but

00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:21.810
that's the reason.
 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.146
His general Ptolemy II got the
Kingdom of Egypt,

00:03:25.146 --> 00:03:28.200
which was very,
very important because Egypt

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.250
was one of the wealthiest parts
of the ancient world.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.568
Ptolemy II took Egypt and set
up his own sort of

00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:40.574
Greco-Egyptian kingdom there,
so when we talk about these

00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:42.609
things--
sometimes you'll hear us talk

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.680
about the Syrian Empire or the
Greco Syrian Empire,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.110
or simply the Greek Empire.
 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.883
That's because there was a
Greek sort of veneer over what

00:03:50.883 --> 00:03:53.310
would have been local
differences.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.217
You'd have Egyptians speaking
ancient Egyptian languages but

00:03:56.217 --> 00:03:58.780
the elites in the cities would
be speaking Greek,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.376
so the culture,
the elite culture would still

00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:03.560
be Greek and the same way in
Syria.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.536
The Ptolemies are easier to
keep straight because they

00:04:06.536 --> 00:04:08.389
tended to all be named Ptolemy.
 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.479
They might have a nickname,
like Ptolemy Philadelphus is a

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:13.919
very famous one,
but then they would give them

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.568
numbers.
 

00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:18.041
Ptolemy II was the first
general who ruled Egypt,

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:21.440
and then his descendants would
be named II, III,

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.480
and IV and that sort of--and so
forth.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.339
The other empire that was
important,

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:28.750
but we'll not talk about it too
much today,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.507
is what was Macedonia and
Greece itself and the General

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:35.709
Antigonus Gonatas was the one
who took that.

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:40.305
That would be its own sort of
area until the Romans defeated

00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:44.903
the different Greek rulers there
and took over Macedonia and

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:45.759
Greece.
 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.119
What's important for us though
is really the Seleucids and the

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.192
Ptolemies because if you draw a
line separating Syria from

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:56.841
Egypt,
the line goes right through

00:04:56.841 --> 00:04:57.600
Palestine.
 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.838
The Jews were kind of caught,
therefore,

00:05:00.838 --> 00:05:03.841
on the border,
so Judea at this time was on

00:05:03.841 --> 00:05:08.130
the border between these two
empires and they were constantly

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.920
fighting trying to aggrandize
their own kingdoms.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.613
The Jews were often,
therefore, caught right in the

00:05:15.613 --> 00:05:16.278
middle.
 

00:05:16.278 --> 00:05:22.930
Antiochus IV Epiphanes reigned
from 175 to 164 BCE.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.596
He's called the IV obviously
because he's the fourth

00:05:26.596 --> 00:05:27.459
Antiochus.
 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:30.072
Epiphanes though is a sort of
nickname and it means

00:05:30.072 --> 00:05:32.632
"manifest,"
it's just the Greek word for

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.940
"manifest."
 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.214
What Antiochus was doing with
his name is saying he was

00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:39.519
claiming divine honors for
himself,

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.240
because what he's saying is,
"I'm Antiochus,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.529
God made manifest among
you."

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:46.129
This was not that unusual.
 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.745
As I said last time,
Alexander had sort of claimed

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:50.240
divine honors for himself.
 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.923
He was following the lead of a
lot of eastern monarchs and

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:55.841
rulers who would claim to be the
descendants of a god and claim

00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:58.571
to be a god themselves,
and would receive cult and

00:05:58.571 --> 00:05:59.060
worship.
 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.076
Antiochus IV,
though, was ruling at that time

00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:05.709
and he had control,
he had gained control of Judea.

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:08.278
At one point he almost
conquered Egypt,

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:11.521
as a matter of fact,
again they were always these

00:06:11.521 --> 00:06:14.088
battles, but then Rome
intervened.

00:06:14.088 --> 00:06:16.819
Rome was not in control of
eastern Mediterranean at this

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.600
time but they started getting
more and more powerful,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.108
so Rome came to Egypt,
and a Roman general basically

00:06:23.108 --> 00:06:24.523
said,
"You've got to

00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:26.613
withdraw,"
and forced Antiochus IV to pull

00:06:26.613 --> 00:06:27.339
out of Egypt.
 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:28.689
Why did Rome do that?
 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:31.891
Well Rome wanted--Rome didn't
want any other empire in the

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:35.149
Mediterranean to get too
powerful so they wanted small--

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:36.928
they didn't want to really
control all the eastern part of

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:39.065
the Mediterranean at this time,
they would have been stretched

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.802
too thin,
but they wanted these two

00:06:40.802 --> 00:06:42.790
kingdoms to balance each other
out,

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.089
so they didn't--they weren't
particularly for Antiochus IV,

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.067
they just didn't want him to
destroy the Egyptian Ptolemies

00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:51.891
and him to take over Egypt
because it would make him too

00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:52.560
powerful.
 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.480
Rome, though,
shows that they have enough

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.641
power that they kind of play the
referee between different

00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:02.778
kingdoms even in the east at
this time.

00:07:02.778 --> 00:07:05.276
While Judea,
though, was under Antiochus

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:09.180
control a lot of Jews tried to
figure out how do you deal with

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.740
this whole process of
Hellenization?

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.226
In other words,
if you want your own kids to

00:07:14.226 --> 00:07:16.456
get ahead in the world,
in this time,

00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:19.920
and you're going to have an
elite family yourself in a town,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.773
in a city, it makes sense for
your kids to get a Greek

00:07:22.773 --> 00:07:23.420
education.
 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.041
You want your sons,
for example,

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:27.451
to be able to speak,
and read, and write Greek.

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:27.870
Why?
 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.526
Because that's the lingra
franca of the elite--of

00:07:30.526 --> 00:07:33.329
business, and of government,
and all that sort of thing.

00:07:33.329 --> 00:07:36.315
It's precisely the way it is
now with English around the

00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:36.750
world.
 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.100
Elite families want their kids
to have English education,

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.089
they want them to be familiar
with American culture,

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.185
and, if possible,
they'll even send them to a

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:49.411
university in the States,
or to graduate school in the

00:07:49.411 --> 00:07:51.545
States,
and this is partly because

00:07:51.545 --> 00:07:54.129
there are good universities in
the States,

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:56.737
but it's also partly because
they know that to get ahead

00:07:56.737 --> 00:07:59.355
their kids need to use English,
they need to become,

00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:02.149
in some sense,
to some extent Americanized.

00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:05.632
This is what's going on even in
places like Jerusalem at this

00:08:05.632 --> 00:08:06.040
time.
 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.855
Jerusalem wasn't a huge city
but it was important enough that

00:08:08.855 --> 00:08:10.639
there were elites there
themselves,

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:14.822
and so they responded to this
urge of Hellenizing culture to

00:08:14.822 --> 00:08:18.439
have their kids educated in the
gymnasium.

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.560
Remember?
 

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.946
So they would themselves get
this sort of Greek rhetorical

00:08:22.946 --> 00:08:23.660
education.
 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.519
In fact, what we'll call for
the purposes,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:29.180
liberals and conservatives in
Jerusalem,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.371
because there was conflict in
Jerusalem at this time over how

00:08:32.371 --> 00:08:34.820
much Hellenization you should go
along with.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.844
Apparently, a majority of the
priests and the lay nobility

00:08:39.844 --> 00:08:44.712
supported the Hellenizing group,
that is the Jewish leaders who

00:08:44.712 --> 00:08:47.804
wanted to bring more
Hellenization into the Jerusalem

00:08:47.804 --> 00:08:48.399
itself.
 

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:53.475
The high priest at this time
was named Jason,

00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:59.357
his name is on here,
and in 175 he built a gymnasium

00:08:59.357 --> 00:09:01.320
in Jerusalem.
 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.668
Why did he build a gymnasium in
Jerusalem?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.913
Well if you're going to have
Greek education you have to have

00:09:05.913 --> 00:09:06.700
a gymnasium.
 

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.548
This--he also founded a Greek
polis,

00:09:10.548 --> 00:09:14.852
that is as Greek city structure
and Jason apparently paid

00:09:14.852 --> 00:09:19.616
Antiochus for the privilege of
having Jerusalem recognized as a

00:09:19.616 --> 00:09:20.769
Greek city.
 

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:24.722
This would have consolidated
the power of those Jewish

00:09:24.722 --> 00:09:28.976
leaders who wanted to press
Greek culture more rather than

00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:33.899
those Jewish leaders who wanted
to hold back on Greek culture.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:38.703
If you control the gymnasium,
and you control the means of

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.125
education,
you actually control the

00:09:41.125 --> 00:09:44.110
citizenry because you can't
become a citizen of a Greek

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:45.860
polis,
a Greek city,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.538
unless you yourself have Greek
education,

00:09:48.538 --> 00:09:51.522
so sons would--sons of people
would go to the

00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:52.808
gymnasium.
 

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:56.807
Notice what this would do also,
it would disenfranchise those

00:09:56.807 --> 00:10:01.139
leading families who didn't want
to have their sons Hellenized.

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:04.827
By holding the control of the
education, you disenfranchise

00:10:04.827 --> 00:10:08.580
conservative Jews who are
resisting this Greek influence.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:11.410
About this time,
apparently, Antiochus offered

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.490
citizenship status to the Jews,
but, like I said,

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.808
admission to the gymnasium
and the ephebate--

00:10:17.808 --> 00:10:21.505
remember the ephebate we
talked about how the boys around

00:10:21.505 --> 00:10:24.452
the years 18 to 22 or so,
around the age that you guys

00:10:24.452 --> 00:10:27.288
are, you would be enrolled in
this sort of quasi education,

00:10:27.288 --> 00:10:31.620
quasi military training club
sort of thing of the town.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.432
That was the ephebate,
and you had to go through that

00:10:34.432 --> 00:10:35.288
to be a citizen.
 

00:10:35.288 --> 00:10:38.227
Jason and his party controlled
this, and in fact,

00:10:38.227 --> 00:10:40.554
they renamed Jerusalem
"Antioch of

00:10:40.554 --> 00:10:41.779
Jerusalem."
 

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:44.738
There are lots of different
cities named Antioch in the

00:10:44.738 --> 00:10:47.633
ancient world,
and they were all done in honor

00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:51.216
of some Antiochus,
so Jerusalem was renamed

00:10:51.216 --> 00:10:53.340
Antioch of Jerusalem.
 

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.293
The high priesthood was the
main ruler of the Jews at this

00:10:57.293 --> 00:10:57.779
time.
 

00:10:57.779 --> 00:10:59.817
They didn't have a king,
and they didn't have a direct

00:10:59.817 --> 00:11:01.971
governor,
so whoever controlled the high

00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:05.018
priesthood was sort of the
political ruler also at this

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:05.470
time.
 

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.645
But Antiochus was the one who
had the privilege of appointing

00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:10.899
the high priest.
 

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:17.158
Menelaus, another leading Jew,
his name is on your handout,

00:11:17.158 --> 00:11:20.466
seems to have offered Antiochus
more money for the priesthood

00:11:20.466 --> 00:11:22.450
trying to get it away from
Jason,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.570
and he couldn't afford it.
 

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:29.274
In order to pay for his own
priesthood he took gold vessels

00:11:29.274 --> 00:11:32.682
and instruments out of the
temple treasury,

00:11:32.682 --> 00:11:36.009
and this seems to have caused a
riot.

00:11:36.009 --> 00:11:44.899
Now notice, "Jason,"
is that a good Jewish name?

00:11:44.899 --> 00:11:51.168
No, that's not a good Jewish
name.

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:55.048
"Menelaus"
is that a good Jewish name?

00:11:55.048 --> 00:12:00.308
No, Jason and Menelaus are both
famous Greek names.

00:12:00.308 --> 00:12:03.518
You have two guys fighting for
the high priesthood in

00:12:03.518 --> 00:12:06.412
Jerusalem,
both with Greek names,

00:12:06.412 --> 00:12:11.142
not traditional Hebrew names,
and both of them apparently

00:12:11.142 --> 00:12:14.309
trying to get in with this
Hellenizing process.

00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:17.080
They get into a big fight.
 

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.019
To settle things down in
Jerusalem,

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:22.599
Antiochus takes control of
Jerusalem and he stationed

00:12:22.599 --> 00:12:25.979
Syrian troops,
that is the Greco-Syrian

00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:28.649
troops, in Jerusalem in 167.
 

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.200
Now things are heating up.
 

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:35.029
Around this time changes were
made to the temple in Jerusalem.

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:37.629
It may have been basically to
accommodate the soldiers.

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:40.900
They may have had to house
soldiers from the Greco-Syrian

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:44.405
Empire, and they may have used
the temple mount apparently to

00:12:44.405 --> 00:12:45.750
house some of them.
 

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.889
This caused changes to the
temple.

00:12:47.889 --> 00:12:49.860
At this time Menelaus is in
charge,

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:54.452
and his Hellenizing party,
which we could call the radical

00:12:54.452 --> 00:12:57.957
reformers,
they saw--this is the beginning

00:12:57.957 --> 00:13:00.019
of the anti-Judaism laws.
 

00:13:00.019 --> 00:13:03.809
About this time several laws
were passed that forbade

00:13:03.809 --> 00:13:06.945
circumcision,
you can't circumcise your boys

00:13:06.945 --> 00:13:10.080
anymore;
you're forbidden from observing

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:13.724
the Torah, the Jewish law;
it may have been that even a

00:13:13.724 --> 00:13:17.192
pig was sacrificed on the altar
in Jerusalem in the Holy of

00:13:17.192 --> 00:13:20.946
Holies,
and the temple was turned into

00:13:20.946 --> 00:13:24.558
a syncretistic Jewish pagan
grove.

00:13:24.558 --> 00:13:27.903
In traditional Greek religion
and other religions having a

00:13:27.903 --> 00:13:31.129
grove of trees is sort of
considered the sacred area.

00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:34.147
Like when you walk through a
forest now and you come upon a

00:13:34.147 --> 00:13:36.019
nice open kind of grove of
trees,

00:13:36.019 --> 00:13:38.688
and all of sudden you just kind
of feel like some nymph or

00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:40.610
something is going to jump out
at you,

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.365
and God is there,
so the Greeks liked these sorts

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:46.107
of groves of trees,
so this is often what they

00:13:46.107 --> 00:13:47.700
would use as a sacred area.
 

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.736
They did this to the temple,
and it was renamed as a shrine

00:13:51.736 --> 00:13:52.990
to Zeus Olympus.
 

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:56.254
Now notice what's happening,
I talked about syncretism last

00:13:56.254 --> 00:13:56.649
time.
 

00:13:56.649 --> 00:14:00.010
If you're one of these liberal
Jews, you may not really believe

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.528
you're doing anything bad.
 

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:04.413
You're not forsaking Judaism,
you're just updating it,

00:14:04.413 --> 00:14:06.970
you're just bringing it up to
the modern era.

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.032
You might say,
"Well what's wrong with

00:14:09.032 --> 00:14:10.308
calling it Zeus Olympus?
 

00:14:10.308 --> 00:14:13.110
We all know these are just
different names given to the

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.183
same god anyway,
there's just one supreme

00:14:15.183 --> 00:14:15.908
God."
 

00:14:15.908 --> 00:14:19.188
So they may well have
identified the Jewish god Yahweh

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:22.778
with this god Zeus Olympus and
said it's just two different

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:25.302
names,
one Greek name and one Jewish

00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:27.210
name for the same Jewish god.
 

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:28.798
That may have been what they
were thinking about.

00:14:28.798 --> 00:14:32.815
They could also have been
thinking about the Syrian god

00:14:32.815 --> 00:14:34.863
Baal,
that Baal Shamin was a Syrian

00:14:34.863 --> 00:14:37.620
god, so they're just saying
we'll have an altar here,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.086
Antiochus will be happy because
we're worshipping this Syrian

00:14:40.086 --> 00:14:41.692
god here,
the Greeks are happy we're

00:14:41.692 --> 00:14:43.961
worshipping Zeus Olympus,
and the Jews will be happy

00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:45.460
because it's identified as
Yahweh.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.058
This whole process of
Hellenization,

00:14:48.058 --> 00:14:51.019
therefore, I'm interpreting
this--in a lot of history books,

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:53.765
sometimes, you'll get the idea
that the Jews were all good

00:14:53.765 --> 00:14:55.788
loyal Jews just trying to keep
the law,

00:14:55.788 --> 00:14:59.078
trying to keep Torah,
and that Antiochus IV Epiphanes

00:14:59.078 --> 00:15:03.063
is putting all this on them and
forcing Greek religion and Greek

00:15:03.063 --> 00:15:04.330
culture on them.
 

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.278
That's not really the way it
happened.

00:15:06.278 --> 00:15:08.558
I've told the story the way
I--I've proceeded--

00:15:08.558 --> 00:15:10.254
if you read between the lines
of some of these ancient Jewish

00:15:10.254 --> 00:15:12.385
texts,
it's more like it's a debate

00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:15.000
that's going on within Judaism
itself.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.649
How Greek should we be?
 

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:20.798
How much do you accommodate the
dominant culture?

00:15:20.798 --> 00:15:23.254
Precisely the way you get a lot
of this kind of debate in the

00:15:23.254 --> 00:15:25.278
modern world,
our time, of how much do you

00:15:25.278 --> 00:15:27.467
want your kids,
your Jewish boys and girls to

00:15:27.467 --> 00:15:29.950
assimilate to be just as
American as everybody else?

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.940
How much intermarriage do you
want to have or do you allow?

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.498
If you're a Muslim immigrant to
this country,

00:15:35.498 --> 00:15:38.404
the first generation,
do you let them listen to hip

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:38.870
hop?
 

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.610
Do you let the women stop
covering their hair?

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.769
Where do you draw the line?
 

00:15:43.769 --> 00:15:46.081
What I'm arguing is that this
is what was going on,

00:15:46.081 --> 00:15:48.808
and it was an internal Jewish
conflict that was going on.

00:15:48.808 --> 00:15:51.177
There were several responses to
Hellenization,

00:15:51.177 --> 00:15:52.440
therefore, among Jews.
 

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.123
It wasn't just that the
Helleni--that Greeks are here

00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:57.908
putting this onto Jews,
but there were responses within

00:15:57.908 --> 00:15:58.889
Judaism itself.
 

00:15:58.889 --> 00:16:03.782
As I've already said Menelaus
and the liberals accept it and

00:16:03.782 --> 00:16:04.860
promote it.
 

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.663
Another priest that had been
dislocated from the high

00:16:07.663 --> 00:16:10.307
priesthood earlier,
his family had originally been

00:16:10.307 --> 00:16:11.980
the high priesthood family.
 

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.480
Onias, I think Onias IV is on
your hand out there.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.589
Onias IV actually withdrew from
Jerusalem and went off and built

00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:19.330
a new temple.
 

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.509
He says, well if you're going
to destroy the existing Jewish

00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:27.830
temple we're going to have an
alternative temple elsewhere.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.678
You also have these people that
come to be called the Hasidim,

00:16:30.678 --> 00:16:32.899
it's on your hand out,
that's from a Hebrew word

00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:35.779
meaning the holy ones or pious
ones or something like that.

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:38.861
It--and they're not to be
confused with the modern Hasidim

00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:41.889
who live in Brooklyn and who
come from Eastern Europe.

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:44.666
That's a modern movement that
came about in the medieval

00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.693
period and has come to--but it's
the same word used for these

00:16:47.693 --> 00:16:48.250
people.
 

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.158
These weren't Jews who decided
to be very strict and they

00:16:51.158 --> 00:16:53.340
seemed to reject a lot of Greek
culture.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.340
They certainly rejected Greek
religion and Greek sacrifice.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.344
They seemed to promote the
speaking of Hebrew,

00:16:59.344 --> 00:17:02.349
the use of Hebrew text,
and particularly pious

00:17:02.349 --> 00:17:04.420
observations of Jewish law.
 

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:07.548
You even have a group of high
priests,

00:17:07.548 --> 00:17:10.047
former high priests,
who have been dislocated and

00:17:10.047 --> 00:17:12.805
other priestly families
withdrawing from Jerusalem and

00:17:12.805 --> 00:17:15.615
apparently going out in the
desert and maybe building a

00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:18.821
community out there,
and we find out about them in

00:17:18.821 --> 00:17:22.673
the twentieth century when the
Dead Sea scrolls were discovered

00:17:22.673 --> 00:17:23.980
in the late 1940s.
 

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:28.117
A lot of the theories are these
Dead Sea scrolls were the

00:17:28.117 --> 00:17:32.625
writings of a sect of Jews led
by people who had been priestly

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:35.146
families,
who moved out into the desert,

00:17:35.146 --> 00:17:37.328
set up camp on the shores of
the Dead Sea,

00:17:37.328 --> 00:17:40.317
and had their own little sort
of maybe quasi monastic

00:17:40.317 --> 00:17:42.601
community there,
very strict in their

00:17:42.601 --> 00:17:45.618
observation of the Law,
they keep their documents--they

00:17:45.618 --> 00:17:49.358
have some documents in Greek,
some in Hebrew, some in Aramaic.

00:17:49.358 --> 00:17:51.973
So that may have been another
way to respond to this

00:17:51.973 --> 00:17:55.152
increasing Hellenization to just
pull away and form a different

00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:55.868
community.
 

00:17:55.868 --> 00:17:59.750
Then you have the reaction of
Mattathias.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:03.596
Mattathias was a priest from
Jerusalem who had settled in a

00:18:03.596 --> 00:18:07.180
village called Modein,
in the hill country of Judea.

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:10.788
Apparently, according to the
text that had come down to us,

00:18:10.788 --> 00:18:13.960
some of which had to be sort of
legends and that sort of thing,

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:16.516
hero worship,
the story goes that Mattathias

00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:19.726
was in his village and a priest
and a soldier come from

00:18:19.726 --> 00:18:23.430
Jerusalem to the village,
and they're trying to force the

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:25.348
Jews to sacrifice on an altar.
 

00:18:25.348 --> 00:18:29.016
Now what an altar is most of
the time is--do you all see this

00:18:29.016 --> 00:18:31.400
little base over there in the
corner?

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.210
There's just a little pillar
that might be this high,

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.526
and to offer something--you
don't actually have to sacrifice

00:18:36.526 --> 00:18:39.394
a chicken or anything like that,
you can obviously sacrifice

00:18:39.394 --> 00:18:41.269
animals,
but you can just pour out some

00:18:41.269 --> 00:18:43.910
wine or you can pour some grain
or something like that on the

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.938
altar,
burn it up, and that will

00:18:45.938 --> 00:18:50.068
suffice as an offering to a god,
without killing an animal.

00:18:50.068 --> 00:18:51.990
Something like this may have
been going on.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.299
Mattathias, it is said,
took the sword away from the

00:18:55.299 --> 00:18:59.259
soldier and killed this priest
and the soldier for encouraging

00:18:59.259 --> 00:19:02.440
Jews in his village to sacrifice
to the gods.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.108
This was, of course,
against the law,

00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:07.690
so Mattathias runs off to the
hills,

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.230
taking his family with him,
his sons,

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.733
he had several sons,
and this is the beginning of

00:19:13.733 --> 00:19:17.750
the war that comes to be called
the Maccabean Revolt.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.640
It's called Maccabean because
after Mattathias died,

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.117
shortly thereafter,
he was the leader of the revolt

00:19:24.117 --> 00:19:27.872
in the beginning,
his son Judas becomes the head

00:19:27.872 --> 00:19:33.854
general of the bunch,
and Judas, early on earned the

00:19:33.854 --> 00:19:36.430
nickname Maccabeus.
 

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.794
We're not really sure what the
nickname means or where it comes

00:19:38.794 --> 00:19:40.654
from,
it could be something like

00:19:40.654 --> 00:19:43.827
"the hammer,"
so he could be "Judah the

00:19:43.827 --> 00:19:45.981
hammer,"
but it may have been an

00:19:45.981 --> 00:19:49.632
attribute from him being a very
good general and winning a lot

00:19:49.632 --> 00:19:50.710
of battles.
 

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:54.472
Against all odds,
this rag tag bunch of basically

00:19:54.472 --> 00:19:59.316
guerilla fighters,
up against a far superior army

00:19:59.316 --> 00:20:03.365
of Antiochus IV Epiphanes,
they beat them,

00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:06.115
they retook Jerusalem,
they didn't actually beat them

00:20:06.115 --> 00:20:08.077
in Syria,
they just beat them several

00:20:08.077 --> 00:20:10.957
battles in Judea,
and Judas was able to recapture

00:20:10.957 --> 00:20:12.440
Jerusalem and the temple.
 

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:18.147
In the year 164,
they cleansed the temple of the

00:20:18.147 --> 00:20:21.734
profanation,
the pollution of having maybe

00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:24.108
pigs and things like that
sacrificed,

00:20:24.108 --> 00:20:26.160
it being polluted as a Greek
temple,

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.278
and so 164 is the beginning of
the celebration of the Jewish

00:20:32.278 --> 00:20:34.250
holiday Hanukkah.
 

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.140
The Hanukkah song now--no we
won't sing the Hanukkah song.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:43.198
So 164 in the cleansing of the
temple is what Jews celebrate

00:20:43.198 --> 00:20:44.568
with Hanukkah.
 

00:20:44.568 --> 00:20:49.751
Judas Maccabeus reigned as not
an official king at that point

00:20:49.751 --> 00:20:53.380
but he reigned over Judea of
this time,

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.000
and there was still battles
that raged between him and his

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.413
family,
and his army,

00:20:57.413 --> 00:21:01.288
and Antiochus IV Epiphanes,
and then other descendants.

00:21:01.288 --> 00:21:02.945
After he died,
his brother--one of his

00:21:02.945 --> 00:21:05.395
brothers became the leader,
and then another brother became

00:21:05.395 --> 00:21:08.089
the leader,
gradually these different

00:21:08.089 --> 00:21:13.086
people of this family came to
set up their own dynasty of

00:21:13.086 --> 00:21:14.960
rulers themselves.
 

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.690
Their family name was not
Maccabeus,

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:19.755
that was just a nickname,
the family name was Hasmoneus

00:21:19.755 --> 00:21:22.308
and so we call this the
Hasmonean Dynasty,

00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.250
that's the descendants of
Mattathias.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:28.578
Some of them actually were then
proclaimed king,

00:21:28.578 --> 00:21:32.345
they were recognized as--with
the title king by the later

00:21:32.345 --> 00:21:36.380
rulers of the neighboring areas
like the Syria-- Greco-Syrian

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.118
Empire.
 

00:21:37.118 --> 00:21:43.298
The Hasmonean Dynasty was in
power from the year 165 to the

00:21:43.298 --> 00:21:44.788
year 60 BCE.
 

00:21:44.788 --> 00:21:49.202
Now, that's the way one people
responded to this,

00:21:49.202 --> 00:21:52.420
they revolted against the
rulers.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:57.146
Another way some Jews responded
was by believing that military

00:21:57.146 --> 00:22:01.210
revolt wasn't the way to go,
that God would somehow

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.965
intervene miraculously that God
would send an angel or some kind

00:22:05.965 --> 00:22:10.721
of heavenly figure down to earth
and an army of heavenly figures

00:22:10.721 --> 00:22:15.778
would defeat Antiochus and usher
in the new Kingdom of Israel.

00:22:15.778 --> 00:22:18.211
And that's where you get the
story of that from the book of

00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:18.588
Daniel.
 

00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:23.532
I asked you to read Daniel,
at least the last part of

00:22:23.532 --> 00:22:28.000
Daniel for today,
if you've got your Bibles take

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.660
it out and turn with me first to
Daniel 8:20.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.400
Now the book of Daniel is in
two halves.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.169
The first half of it tells
about the adventures of this

00:22:38.169 --> 00:22:41.480
young man Daniel who's very,
very wise and very smart and

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.972
very loyal,
and who refuses to worship the

00:22:44.972 --> 00:22:46.140
Persian god.
 

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.500
Of course this--these are
morality stories written for

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:53.497
Jews who were living under Greek
domination encouraging them not

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:57.240
to worship Greek gods but its
past in the distant past.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.983
Then the second half of Daniel
is a whole series of visions and

00:23:00.983 --> 00:23:01.769
prophecies.
 

00:23:01.769 --> 00:23:04.380
Daniel says,
"I was in a dream,

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.548
I was in a vision on a day,
and I saw this,

00:23:06.548 --> 00:23:08.923
and this angel told me to do
this and this person told me

00:23:08.923 --> 00:23:11.211
this," and so it's the
narration of the history of

00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:13.838
humankind that's part of which
has already happened by the time

00:23:13.838 --> 00:23:15.942
of Daniel,
but most of which is to happen

00:23:15.942 --> 00:23:17.140
in the future for Daniel.
 

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:20.048
Some of this stuff actually
does happen.

00:23:20.048 --> 00:23:22.356
So for example,
and he tells about different

00:23:22.356 --> 00:23:22.838
beasts.
 

00:23:22.838 --> 00:23:24.949
There's the ram that does this,
there's the beast that does

00:23:24.949 --> 00:23:27.865
this,
but you know that these beasts

00:23:27.865 --> 00:23:33.380
represent different kingdoms
because in Chapter 8:20 he says,

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:36.125
"As for the ram that you
saw [in your vision]

00:23:36.125 --> 00:23:39.468
with the two horns,
these are the Kings of Mede and

00:23:39.468 --> 00:23:40.420
Persia."
 

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.815
There was the kingdom of the
Medes and the kingdom of the

00:23:42.815 --> 00:23:44.568
Persians who came together under
Cyrus.

00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:47.568
"The male goat is the King
of Greece,

00:23:47.568 --> 00:23:51.862
and the great horn between its
eyes is the first king,"

00:23:51.862 --> 00:23:56.118
so that would be Phillip,
Alexander's father.

00:23:56.118 --> 00:23:59.990
"As for the horn that was
broken in place of which four

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:02.806
others arose,
four kingdoms shall arise from

00:24:02.806 --> 00:24:05.220
his nation but not with his
power."

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.433
This is Alexander,
he's broken,

00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:11.200
and his kingdom is divided up
into four empires,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.808
like I told you about earlier,
but none of those four empires

00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:18.298
enjoys the same power that
Alexander the Great enjoyed with

00:24:18.298 --> 00:24:18.778
his.
 

00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:21.338
Notice how you're already given
a clue,

00:24:21.338 --> 00:24:24.430
right here in Daniel,
that these different images,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.099
these different beasts are to
refer to kingdoms that are going

00:24:27.099 --> 00:24:29.288
to come in the future from
Daniel's perspective.

00:24:29.288 --> 00:24:31.480
We know, actually,
that they already did.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.125
Then what happens in Daniel is
each different chapter,

00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:36.869
the last part of Daniel,
in a sense tells the story over

00:24:36.869 --> 00:24:37.368
again.
 

00:24:37.368 --> 00:24:39.300
He has another vision and
instead of reading it

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.305
chronologically,
as if Chapter 9 told about one

00:24:42.305 --> 00:24:44.173
century,
and then Chapter 10 or Chapter

00:24:44.173 --> 00:24:46.244
11 is the next century,
and the next century,

00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:49.407
you actually have to read them
cycles because what Daniel is

00:24:49.407 --> 00:24:52.462
doing he's giving you a prophecy
of what's going to happen

00:24:52.462 --> 00:24:55.406
politically related to Judea,
but he's giving it to you in

00:24:55.406 --> 00:24:57.578
several different visions that
all tell the same story,

00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.150
just in different kind of
symbols.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:01.730
Turn over now to Chapter 11.
 

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.759
Here again it's sort of like
the fourth--

00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:15.654
Chapter 11:2,
"The four shall be far

00:25:15.654 --> 00:25:18.828
richer then all of them when he
has become strong to his riches,

00:25:18.828 --> 00:25:21.920
he shall stir up all against
the Kingdom of Greece,"

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.175
so this is actually talking
about the Persian ruler who will

00:25:25.175 --> 00:25:26.170
attack Greece.
 

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:29.433
"Then a warrior king shall
arise who shall rule with great

00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:31.328
dominion,"
that's Alexander,

00:25:31.328 --> 00:25:33.910
"While still rising in
power,"--

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.020
Alexander remember was still
young and increasing his power

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.000
when he died--
"his kingdom shall be

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.589
broken and divided to the four
winds of heaven but not to his

00:25:41.589 --> 00:25:42.410
posterity."
 

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.874
Alexander had a child but the
child dies, and Alexander's

00:25:45.874 --> 00:25:48.719
kingdom did not go to any of his
own offspring,

00:25:48.719 --> 00:25:51.380
they went to these other four
generals.

00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:54.291
Then notice in verse 5,
"The King of the South

00:25:54.291 --> 00:25:57.029
shall grow strong,"
and the next verse,

00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:59.402
"The daughter of the King
of the South shall come to the

00:25:59.402 --> 00:26:01.380
King of the North to ratify the
agreement."

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.789
What's the King of the South?
 

00:26:03.789 --> 00:26:06.098
Who's the King of the South?
 

00:26:06.098 --> 00:26:10.000
Ptolemy, some Ptolemy,
one of the Ptolemies.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.671
So whenever you see King of the
South in Daniel it's always

00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:15.390
referring to the Ptolemaic
Dynasty, one of the Ptolemies.

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:18.558
Who's the King of the North?
 

00:26:18.558 --> 00:26:21.465
Seleucus or Antiochus,
so whenever you see the King of

00:26:21.465 --> 00:26:23.990
the North it refers to one of
the Seleucids.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.902
So over and over again in
Daniel, you're going to get the

00:26:25.902 --> 00:26:27.375
King of the North,
the King of the South,

00:26:27.375 --> 00:26:29.137
the King of the North,
and notice how it says,

00:26:29.137 --> 00:26:31.587
"The daughter of the King
of the South shall come to the

00:26:31.587 --> 00:26:33.670
King of the North to ratify the
agreement."

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.888
If you look down--if you have a
study bible and you look at your

00:26:36.888 --> 00:26:40.006
footnotes it'll actually give
you the names of these different

00:26:40.006 --> 00:26:42.048
people that historians can
identify.

00:26:42.048 --> 00:26:45.364
This may be Berenice because we
know that she was a daughter of

00:26:45.364 --> 00:26:48.090
Antiochus or Seleucus,
she was married to one of the

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:48.838
Ptolemies.
 

00:26:48.838 --> 00:26:51.419
If you follow in your study
bible--now it has to be a good

00:26:51.419 --> 00:26:52.460
critical study bible.
 

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.040
I mean if you--by real
scholars--if you use these

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.051
bibles that take all this as
prophecy that relates to the

00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:01.440
Soviet Union or to Russia they
might tell you things like,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:05.031
"Well the King of the
North here refers to the head of

00:27:05.031 --> 00:27:08.439
Politburo or something like
this," and so if it's a

00:27:08.439 --> 00:27:12.278
bible by a contemporary church
that takes all this is referring

00:27:12.278 --> 00:27:15.808
to our time or the time
immediately to the future,

00:27:15.808 --> 00:27:17.640
which of course a lot of
Christians do,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.470
then their footnotes might be
different.

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.605
But the footnotes in any good
study bible will place these

00:27:22.605 --> 00:27:26.180
people to the history of what's
going on in Judea as this time.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.760
Now go over to 11:29 because
I'm not going to lead you

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:37.868
through all the stuff that
happens in Chapter 11 because if

00:27:37.868 --> 00:27:40.420
you read it,
and you read it with the

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:42.343
footnotes,
it's basically telling you a

00:27:42.343 --> 00:27:45.484
history of the battles and
alliances between the Seleucids

00:27:45.484 --> 00:27:48.626
and the Ptolemies and where
Judea was caught in the middle

00:27:48.626 --> 00:27:49.950
at different times.
 

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.958
"At the time appointed he
shall return and come into the

00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:53.130
south," this is one of
the--

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:57.950
this is Antiochus,
not Antiochus IV,

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:01.684
"But this time it shall
not be as before for ships of

00:28:01.684 --> 00:28:05.354
Kittim shall come against him
and he shall lose heart and

00:28:05.354 --> 00:28:06.599
withdraw."
 

00:28:06.599 --> 00:28:09.579
Who are the Kittim?
 

00:28:09.579 --> 00:28:11.220
Romans, exactly.
 

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.961
"The Kittim"
is a term that's used in

00:28:12.961 --> 00:28:14.371
Hebrew,
and in a lot of different

00:28:14.371 --> 00:28:16.605
ancient Jewish texts,
and sometimes it seems to refer

00:28:16.605 --> 00:28:18.958
to the Greeks,
and here it clearly refers to

00:28:18.958 --> 00:28:22.451
the Romans because the Romans
come and they force the King of

00:28:22.451 --> 00:28:23.500
the North back.
 

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.607
Notice what it says,
"Forces sent by him--he

00:28:26.607 --> 00:28:30.298
shall turn back and pay heed to
those who forsake the holy

00:28:30.298 --> 00:28:31.528
covenant."
 

00:28:31.528 --> 00:28:35.968
Antiochus IV will pay attention
to the Jews who have forsaken

00:28:35.968 --> 00:28:38.663
the Torah,
"Forces sent by him shall

00:28:38.663 --> 00:28:41.440
occupy and profane the temple
and the fortress.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:45.114
They shall abolish the regular
burnt offering and set up the

00:28:45.114 --> 00:28:47.419
abomination that makes
desolate,"

00:28:47.419 --> 00:28:50.160
or in some modern English
translations,

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.880
"the abomination of
desolation."

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.848
That term will be used also in
the New Testament in several

00:28:56.848 --> 00:28:57.308
places.
 

00:28:57.308 --> 00:29:00.914
"He shall seduce with
intrigue those who violate the

00:29:00.914 --> 00:29:02.009
covenant."
 

00:29:02.009 --> 00:29:05.528
That is, the bad Jews who have
violated the Torah will be in

00:29:05.528 --> 00:29:07.019
cahoots with Antiochus.
 

00:29:07.019 --> 00:29:09.782
"But the people who are
loyal to their God shall stand

00:29:09.782 --> 00:29:10.880
firm and take action.
 

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.548
The wise among the people shall
give understanding to many;

00:29:14.548 --> 00:29:16.959
for some days,
however, they shall by fall by

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:20.079
sword and flame and suffer
captivity and plunder."

00:29:20.079 --> 00:29:21.529
Who are the wise?
 

00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:23.640
The author of the book.
 

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.661
Remember he spent the whole
first part of the book setting

00:29:26.661 --> 00:29:28.038
up Daniel as a wise man.
 

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:31.000
So this author writing under
the name of Daniel,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.166
a wise man, identifies other
wise Jews of his own day and he

00:29:35.166 --> 00:29:39.192
says they're going to oppose
Antiochus IV and some of them

00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:41.098
will die because of it.
 

00:29:41.098 --> 00:29:45.722
"When they fall victim
they shall receive a little help

00:29:45.722 --> 00:29:49.250
and many shall join them
insincerely."

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:52.892
Some scholars believe that this
"little help"

00:29:52.892 --> 00:29:56.400
may be this author's reference
to Judas Maccabeus.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.430
It may be that he knows that
there is an armed resistance,

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:02.528
and it's a little bit of help,
but he doesn't believe,

00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:06.292
himself, that the answer to
Antiochus IV is going to be an

00:30:06.292 --> 00:30:08.884
armed revolt,
he believes it's not going to

00:30:08.884 --> 00:30:09.892
ultimately succeed.
 

00:30:09.892 --> 00:30:10.210
Why?
 

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.315
Because God's going to be the
one who will intervene,

00:30:13.315 --> 00:30:14.630
not Judas Maccabeus.
 

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:16.690
"The king shall act as he
pleases.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.330
He shall exalt himself
andconsider himself greater than

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.630
any god,"--remember
Antiochus Epiphanes?

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.211
"God
manifest"?--"and shall

00:30:23.211 --> 00:30:25.140
speak horrendous things against
the God of gods.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.952
He shall prosper until the
period of wrath is completed for

00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:29.650
what is determined shall be
done.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:32.502
He shall pay no respect to the
gods of his ancestors or to the

00:30:32.502 --> 00:30:35.017
one beloved by women;
he shall pay no respect to any

00:30:35.017 --> 00:30:37.940
other god, he shall consider
himself greater than all."

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.608
So it's all about setting
himself up.

00:30:40.608 --> 00:30:43.974
Now look, "He shall come
into the beautiful land,"

00:30:43.974 --> 00:30:46.200
obviously we're talking about
Judea,

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.268
"And tens of thousands
shall fall victim but Edom and

00:30:50.268 --> 00:30:51.845
Moab,
and the main part of the

00:30:51.845 --> 00:30:53.519
Ammonites shall escape from his
power,

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:56.609
he shall stretch forth his hand
against the countries and the

00:30:56.609 --> 00:30:58.618
land of Egypt shall not
escape."

00:30:58.618 --> 00:31:01.112
In other words,
Antiochus IV this time is

00:31:01.112 --> 00:31:04.288
actually going to capture Egypt,
he's predicting.

00:31:04.288 --> 00:31:07.175
"He shall become ruler of
the treasures of gold and silver

00:31:07.175 --> 00:31:09.948
and all the riches of Egypt,
and the Libyans and the

00:31:09.948 --> 00:31:12.490
Ethiopians shall follow in his
train."

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:16.167
Not only will he overrun Egypt
he's going to go west of Egypt

00:31:16.167 --> 00:31:19.480
and take Libya and south of
Egypt and take Ethiopia.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.440
"But reports from the east
and the north shall alarm him,

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.343
and he shall go out with great
fury to bring ruin and complete

00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:26.390
destruction to many.
 

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:31.326
He shall pitch his palatial
tents between the

00:31:31.326 --> 00:31:34.578
sea,"--what's the sea?
 

00:31:34.578 --> 00:31:36.924
the Mediterranean,
thank you, somebody is

00:31:36.924 --> 00:31:39.855
awake--"and the beautiful
holy mountain,"

00:31:39.855 --> 00:31:41.440
what the holy mountain?
 

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.480
Say it, Zion,
Mount Zion which is where

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.318
Jerusalem is founded.
 

00:31:46.318 --> 00:31:50.934
"Yet he shall come to his
end with no one to help

00:31:50.934 --> 00:31:51.980
him."
 

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.338
"He shall come to his
end"--

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:55.750
wait a minute,
he conquers Egypt,

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.422
takes Libya,
takes Ethiopia,

00:31:58.422 --> 00:32:02.394
comes back through Judea,
sets up camp,

00:32:02.394 --> 00:32:07.451
somewhere in that coastal area
between Jerusalem and the

00:32:07.451 --> 00:32:10.670
Mediterranean and there he dies.
 

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.450
That didn't happen.
 

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:17.810
Antiochus IV never took all of
Egypt, he never took Ethiopia,

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:21.922
he never took Libya,
and he did eventually die,

00:32:21.922 --> 00:32:25.140
but he died way over in
Babylon.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.259
He didn't die here.
 

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:33.042
How do we know that this
document was written around the

00:32:33.042 --> 00:32:34.200
year 164?
 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.450
Because this author doesn't
know the end of the story.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.119
Notice how throughout the
history he's gotten everything

00:32:41.119 --> 00:32:43.644
right--well not every
detail--but he gets a lot of it

00:32:43.644 --> 00:32:44.130
right.
 

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:47.808
He knows when Antiochus the so
and so wins a battle,

00:32:47.808 --> 00:32:49.868
he knows when one of the
Ptolemies wins a battle,

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:52.541
he knows when they tried to
have a treaty between them and

00:32:52.541 --> 00:32:55.260
marry off one of their daughters
to each other to establish

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:55.730
peace.
 

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.240
He knows when they called
truces.

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.050
He knows when the Romans
intervened and stopped battles

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:02.108
between them.
 

00:33:02.108 --> 00:33:06.970
He knows all--he knows that
Antiochus profaned the temple,

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.114
so this has got to be written
after 167 because he's telling

00:33:10.114 --> 00:33:13.098
us all about this stuff that
happened with the temple.

00:33:13.098 --> 00:33:17.858
He knows everything that
happens up to 167,

00:33:17.858 --> 00:33:20.513
and there may be a little hint
that he even knows about Judas

00:33:20.513 --> 00:33:22.633
Maccabeus,
but he doesn't know about

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:26.028
anything what happened to the
cleansing of the temple.

00:33:26.028 --> 00:33:29.631
He doesn't know about the
victory of Judas which happened

00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:30.210
in 164.
 

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.609
Notice how this is wonderfully
convenient for us modern

00:33:32.609 --> 00:33:33.098
scholars.
 

00:33:33.098 --> 00:33:39.130
He gets everything right up to
167 and everything wrong at 164,

00:33:39.130 --> 00:33:42.348
because notice what happens
then, in Chapter 12,

00:33:42.348 --> 00:33:46.308
right as Antiochus IV dies
according to his prophecy,

00:33:46.308 --> 00:33:48.548
"At that time Michael the
Great Prince,

00:33:48.548 --> 00:33:50.250
the protector of your
people,"--

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:52.509
Michael's an angel,
the greatest angel--

00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:53.848
"shall arise.
 

00:33:53.848 --> 00:33:55.038
There shall be a time of
anguish."

00:33:55.038 --> 00:33:56.676
In other words,
this is when all hell breaks

00:33:56.676 --> 00:33:58.259
loose,
the heavens come down,

00:33:58.259 --> 00:34:01.358
Michael swoops in on a chariot
from the sky with angelic

00:34:01.358 --> 00:34:03.770
armies,
and they are the ones who bring

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:04.868
the final victory.
 

00:34:04.868 --> 00:34:08.500
God breaks into history and
brings the final victory.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.940
Judas Maccabeus doesn't win the
battle.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.090
This is how we date apocalyptic
literature.

00:34:16.090 --> 00:34:18.463
Daniel is one of the earliest
cases of what we call

00:34:18.463 --> 00:34:19.650
apocalyptic literature.
 

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.693
It gives--apocalypticism gives
you this vision of what's going

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.539
to happen in the very near
future,

00:34:24.539 --> 00:34:28.362
and it answers the problems of
suffering and the answer is not

00:34:28.362 --> 00:34:31.871
"arm yourselves and fight
the battle yourself,"

00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:35.130
because the odds are
overwhelmingly against you.

00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:38.677
You can't defeat all of Rome,
you can't defeat all of Greece,

00:34:38.677 --> 00:34:41.693
you can't defeat Antiochus IV
Epiphanes by yourself,

00:34:41.693 --> 00:34:42.639
but God can.
 

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.871
And so angelic armies
will break into history and

00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:48.340
bring about the solution to the
problem.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.699
The apocalyptic writer sets
himself up usually,

00:34:51.699 --> 00:34:54.518
far in the distant past,
like this guy says he's Daniel

00:34:54.518 --> 00:34:57.943
writing in the sixth century,
and they narrate history

00:34:57.943 --> 00:35:00.875
through the age--
and you can tell he's got it

00:35:00.875 --> 00:35:01.510
all right.
 

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:05.048
Daniel foresaw this stuff
writing way back in the year

00:35:05.048 --> 00:35:05.449
580.
 

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:08.030
And yet he's--he knows about
the Persians,

00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:09.510
he knows about the Medes,
he knows about the Greeks,

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.101
he knows about Alexander,
he knows about the splitting up

00:35:11.101 --> 00:35:12.693
of Alexander's kingdom,
he knows about Berenice,

00:35:12.693 --> 00:35:15.105
he knows about the Romans,
and so you think he knows all

00:35:15.105 --> 00:35:16.677
this stuff,
he got it all right,

00:35:16.677 --> 00:35:19.259
and you pick it up and you're
reading it in the year 164

00:35:19.259 --> 00:35:21.398
yourself,
or 165, and you think well he

00:35:21.398 --> 00:35:23.980
must be right about what's going
to happen next.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.911
And you think God's going to
break in any day,

00:35:26.911 --> 00:35:29.909
we're going to be saved,
we don't have to fight

00:35:29.909 --> 00:35:32.449
ourselves, we're going to be
saved.

00:35:32.449 --> 00:35:35.099
This is how we date apocalyptic
literature.

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:39.340
Where do they get the history
right, and then when does the

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.460
history go pfffffft.
 

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.820
When does the history just all
of a sudden go wrong?

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:51.161
That's when it's dated because
they're writing up to that

00:35:51.161 --> 00:35:52.210
point.
 

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:54.619
That kind of apocalyptic
mentality,

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:57.838
that apocalyptic world view
will become very important for

00:35:57.838 --> 00:36:01.282
early Christianity because what
I'll argue in the rest of this

00:36:01.282 --> 00:36:03.989
course is,
who else was an apocalyptic

00:36:03.989 --> 00:36:04.610
prophet?
 

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.949
Jesus.
 

00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:09.159
Who else was an apocalyptic
prophet?

00:36:09.159 --> 00:36:11.010
Paul.
 

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.851
All of the earliest followers
of Jesus seemed to have been

00:36:14.851 --> 00:36:18.289
apocalyptic minded Jews,
and that's the beginning of

00:36:18.289 --> 00:36:19.840
early Christianity.
 

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:24.219
Early Christianity starts off
as an apocalyptic Jewish sect.

00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:28.068
They all were reading Daniel,
and when they read other

00:36:28.068 --> 00:36:31.847
prophecies from the Hebrew Bible
they also read those

00:36:31.847 --> 00:36:33.300
apocalyptically.
 

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:38.047
The apocalyptic response is
another one of these responses

00:36:38.047 --> 00:36:39.630
to Hellenization.
 

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.532
In 63, about a hundred years
after the cleansing of the

00:36:43.532 --> 00:36:47.650
temple--first are there any
questions about any of that so

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:48.230
far?
 

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:52.253
I'm giving you a lot of both
confusing history and confusing

00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:53.210
terminology.
 

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:56.909
A hundred years after the
cleansing of the temple,

00:36:56.909 --> 00:37:00.739
mas o menos,
in the year 63 BCE,

00:37:00.739 --> 00:37:05.340
Pompey, the Roman general
Pompey, enters Jerusalem,

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:09.574
and this is when you have the
beginning of Roman control of

00:37:09.574 --> 00:37:10.159
Judea.
 

00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:17.199
Herod the Great gets himself
appointed as King of the Jews by

00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:19.429
the Roman Senate.
 

00:37:19.429 --> 00:37:23.369
Only the Senate at this time
can proclaim anybody a king,

00:37:23.369 --> 00:37:27.164
so the Senate would sometimes
would have client kings on the

00:37:27.164 --> 00:37:29.822
different--
the edge of frontiers of their

00:37:29.822 --> 00:37:30.369
control.
 

00:37:30.369 --> 00:37:32.659
They couldn't--they didn't want
to be bothered with controlling

00:37:32.659 --> 00:37:34.730
everything themselves with their
own armies directly,

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:37.030
or their governors,
so they would appoint local

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.963
kings,
whether in Asia Minor,

00:37:38.963 --> 00:37:40.650
Greece, different parts.
 

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:46.121
Herod the Great was appointed
king by the Roman Senate and he

00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:49.679
ruled from the year 37 to year 4
BCE.

00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:54.876
After Herod the Great died,
his kingdom was split up first

00:37:54.876 --> 00:37:59.757
among his different sons,
but Judea itself eventually was

00:37:59.757 --> 00:38:04.036
placed under direct Roman rule
under procurators that were

00:38:04.036 --> 00:38:08.239
appointed by the Senate or
sometimes by the Emperor,

00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:10.159
and this is what Pilate's job
was.

00:38:10.159 --> 00:38:13.869
Pontius Pilate, who was
the governor of Judea,

00:38:13.869 --> 00:38:17.539
his actual title wasn't
governor, he was a procurator,

00:38:17.539 --> 00:38:19.949
but he was the one in control
of Judea during the life--

00:38:19.949 --> 00:38:22.349
during the time that Jesus was
killed himself.

00:38:22.349 --> 00:38:25.989
Pilate was one of these direct
Roman rulers of Judea.

00:38:25.989 --> 00:38:30.340
Galilee was ruled by a son of
Herod the Great,

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.827
Herod Antipas,
and different descendants of

00:38:33.827 --> 00:38:38.476
Herod would rule in different
parts of Palestine for many

00:38:38.476 --> 00:38:40.219
years after that.
 

00:38:40.219 --> 00:38:44.507
During the first century there
were sporadic uprisings among

00:38:44.507 --> 00:38:47.614
the Jews,
some of them were apocalyptic,

00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:49.802
that is,
they seem to have been Jews who

00:38:49.802 --> 00:38:52.501
were expecting the end to come
but sometimes they seemed to

00:38:52.501 --> 00:38:54.969
have expected that they were
supposed to start it.

00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:57.626
So, for example,
you have Josephus tell us about

00:38:57.626 --> 00:38:59.719
Jewish prophets who arise and
say,

00:38:59.719 --> 00:39:02.059
follow me to Jerusalem,
follow me to Jerusalem,

00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:03.800
and then stand on the Mount of
Olives,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.405
which is this mountain that's
right opposite the main mountain

00:39:06.405 --> 00:39:07.641
of Jerusalem,
and they'd say,

00:39:07.641 --> 00:39:09.809
okay tomorrow we're going to go
out and we're going to march

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:11.978
around the walls of Jerusalem
and the walls are all going to

00:39:11.978 --> 00:39:12.530
fall down.
 

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:15.599
Sound like anything you're
familiar with?

00:39:15.599 --> 00:39:18.760
The walls of Jericho in the
Hebrew Bible falling down after

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:22.085
the Israelites marched around it
for seven days and then seven

00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:23.340
times the last day.
 

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:26.724
Prophets were arising,
using inspiration from Jewish

00:39:26.724 --> 00:39:29.987
prophets from the ancient past,
and they were setting

00:39:29.987 --> 00:39:33.228
themselves up again as prophets,
and, again, expecting God to

00:39:33.228 --> 00:39:34.090
break through.
 

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.835
Sometimes these prophets arose,
and they were themselves

00:39:37.835 --> 00:39:41.378
apocalyptic prophets,
announcing the end of the known

00:39:41.378 --> 00:39:42.400
world soon.
 

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.061
Sometimes, also,
they seem to have been setting

00:39:45.061 --> 00:39:48.534
themselves up as king of the
Jews, and that would make them a

00:39:48.534 --> 00:39:49.230
Messiah.
 

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.818
Because the word messiah
in Hebrew just means "the

00:39:51.818 --> 00:39:53.769
anointed one,"
and what do you do when you

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:55.679
make someone a king in the
ancient world?

00:39:55.679 --> 00:39:57.679
You put oil on their heads.
 

00:39:57.679 --> 00:39:59.780
That's how you anoint a king.
 

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.300
If someone's called "the
anointed one,"

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.559
that's a kingly title.
 

00:40:03.559 --> 00:40:06.291
Now this is very dangerous
because what did I just say

00:40:06.291 --> 00:40:09.539
about how did you get to be a
king and run a controlled area?

00:40:09.539 --> 00:40:12.409
The Senate had to appoint you.
 

00:40:12.409 --> 00:40:15.996
Anybody who set himself up as
king, without being appointed

00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:18.717
king by the Senate,
that was itself an act of

00:40:18.717 --> 00:40:19.460
treason.
 

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.650
There were, though,
other Messianic figures who

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:26.260
would rise and try to provoke
some kind of revolt.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.451
The most important revolt of
the Jewish people during this

00:40:30.451 --> 00:40:32.510
time, started the year 66.
 

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:35.719
Now we're in the Common Era,
so this 66 CE.

00:40:35.719 --> 00:40:41.143
It started in 66 with Jews in
both Judea and Galilee revolting

00:40:41.143 --> 00:40:46.041
against Roman rule,
they drove the Roman squadron

00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:51.657
out of Jerusalem,
and in the year 70 the Romans

00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:54.539
finally,
after four years of warfare,

00:40:54.539 --> 00:40:57.590
they had surrounded Jerusalem
for a full two years,

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.130
they finally took Jerusalem
itself.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:03.949
They flattened--they destroyed
the temple.

00:41:03.949 --> 00:41:07.659
So the destruction of the
temple is the year 70,

00:41:07.659 --> 00:41:12.152
and that's probably the most
important date for this course

00:41:12.152 --> 00:41:16.260
because a lot of important
things in Christianity,

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.730
the early Jesus movement,
happened either before 70,

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:22.132
and they're one kind of event,
some of them happened right

00:41:22.132 --> 00:41:24.130
around the year 70,
and we'll talk about that when

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:25.989
we get to the gospel of Mark in
a couple of times,

00:41:25.989 --> 00:41:28.786
and then some of them--most of
the things happened after the

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:29.260
year 70.
 

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.255
The destruction of the temple
in Jerusalem in the year 70 is

00:41:32.255 --> 00:41:34.489
not only hugely important for
Jews, right?

00:41:34.489 --> 00:41:38.619
because ever since then Jews
have not had a sacrificial cult.

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:41.530
If you are a Jew now where do
you go to sacrifice?

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:44.561
You can't go to the temple
there's--Dome of the Rock

00:41:44.561 --> 00:41:46.880
sitting on where it's supposed
to be.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.550
Jews substituted different
forms of piety,

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.389
reading the Torah,
studying, praying,

00:41:53.389 --> 00:41:55.760
meeting in synagogues,
meeting in other places,

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.989
so Judaism changed radically
beginning in the year 70,

00:41:59.989 --> 00:42:03.664
precisely because the place
where you sacrificed was

00:42:03.664 --> 00:42:04.530
destroyed.
 

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.722
Every ethnic group around the
Mediterranean in the ancient

00:42:07.722 --> 00:42:10.579
world had its religion as some
part of sacrifice.

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:11.889
They all did.
 

00:42:11.889 --> 00:42:14.358
Sacrifice was just common among
different groups around the

00:42:14.358 --> 00:42:15.039
Mediterranean.
 

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:19.445
The year 70 caused the Jews to
stop being primarily a

00:42:19.445 --> 00:42:23.342
sacrificial people,
because they had nowhere to

00:42:23.342 --> 00:42:24.530
sacrifice.
 

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:30.210
The end of the Jewish war is
dated by most people to 74,

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:35.000
because that's the time when
the final battle took place,

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.530
and the fortress that fell was
called Masada.

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.000
So if you go to Israel now
Masada is a shrine.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.150
It's a tourist spot and a
shrine that celebrates the

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:53.036
defeat of the last of Jews at
Masada, the fortress that Herod

00:42:53.036 --> 00:42:54.989
the Great had built.
 

00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:58.090
After that Judaism changes you
have--

00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:02.432
I'm not going to go into much
detail because the way rabbinic

00:43:02.432 --> 00:43:04.429
Judaism--
what you know as Judaism today,

00:43:04.429 --> 00:43:05.940
if you know anything about it
at all,

00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.460
is a result of developments
that happened after 70.

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.628
It's the result of the rabbis
recognizing that the temple cult

00:43:12.628 --> 00:43:13.719
is no longer there.
 

00:43:13.719 --> 00:43:17.351
The rabbis, who are teachers of
the law and commentators of the

00:43:17.351 --> 00:43:20.516
law, they become the central
organizing feature not the

00:43:20.516 --> 00:43:21.219
priests.
 

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:25.139
The priesthood--you still have
Jews named Cohen,

00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:27.041
right, which means
"priest,"

00:43:27.041 --> 00:43:29.820
but priests in Judaism don't
really do much anymore.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.780
It's the rabbis who become
important.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.652
At the beginning of--around the
year 200 you have the rabbinic

00:43:35.652 --> 00:43:38.699
Judaism starting to develop its
written text,

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:41.070
the Mishnah,
the Babylonian Talmud,

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.431
the Jerusalem Talmud,
and this is the birth during

00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:46.559
these centuries of rabbinism.
 

00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:49.518
That is rabbinic Judaism as it
comes to be important.

00:43:49.518 --> 00:43:53.976
There was another Jewish revolt
in 132 to 135 called the Bar

00:43:53.976 --> 00:43:57.327
Kokhba Revolt,
but that was suppressed by the

00:43:57.327 --> 00:44:00.335
Emperor Hadrian in 135,
and that you had the complete

00:44:00.335 --> 00:44:01.489
destruction of Jerusalem.
 

00:44:01.489 --> 00:44:03.793
It was leveled,
it was renamed Aelia

00:44:03.793 --> 00:44:05.489
Capitolina,
a Roman name,

00:44:05.489 --> 00:44:08.340
and Jews after that were
forbidden even to enter

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.280
Jerusalem for a long time.
 

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.050
What's important about all
this--I told you--

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.690
I warned you last time that
last lecture on the Roman

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:18.181
Empire,
the Greek world,

00:44:18.181 --> 00:44:20.952
was going to be some just
boring historical narrative and

00:44:20.952 --> 00:44:23.871
you've had some of the same
thing this time where I just had

00:44:23.871 --> 00:44:26.989
to tell the story of what was
going on in these centuries.

00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:28.619
Why was this all important for
us?

00:44:28.619 --> 00:44:30.610
Here are the main things to
take away from it.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:36.409
Hellenization was extremely
important because it united the

00:44:36.409 --> 00:44:40.170
Mediterranean world,
the eastern Mediterranean but

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:42.788
then the Romans even took over
some of the aspects of

00:44:42.788 --> 00:44:45.909
Hellenization when they took
over all of the Mediterranean.

00:44:45.909 --> 00:44:50.208
By Jesus' time,
all of Palestine was Hellenized

00:44:50.208 --> 00:44:54.320
to some extent,
only to different degrees.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.268
Yes, if you lived in a village
or out in the country you you

00:44:57.268 --> 00:45:00.018
may not have spoken Greek,
you may have spoken Hebrew or

00:45:00.018 --> 00:45:00.619
Aramaic.
 

00:45:00.619 --> 00:45:03.583
But if you were an elite person
in any city, even in Palestine's

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:06.030
time, you were expected to be
able to speak Greek.

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.909
You had some exposure to Greek
culture.

00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:10.050
Syncretism was very important.
 

00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:12.677
The idea that religions
around--religions borrowed from

00:45:12.677 --> 00:45:14.521
each other,
religions were mixtures of

00:45:14.521 --> 00:45:16.670
things, and cultures borrowed
from each other,

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:18.449
so syncretism was very
important.

00:45:18.449 --> 00:45:21.679
There was also conflict within
Judaism.

00:45:21.679 --> 00:45:23.099
I've tried to emphasize that.
 

00:45:23.099 --> 00:45:26.152
Jews weren't all agreed about
how to respond to the things,

00:45:26.152 --> 00:45:28.469
the politics and the cultures
around them.

00:45:28.469 --> 00:45:32.809
Jews conflicted with Jews over
how to adapt to Greek and Roman

00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:34.590
domination and culture.
 

00:45:34.590 --> 00:45:38.557
Political, social,
religious, linguistic,

00:45:38.557 --> 00:45:43.320
cultural issues were all
affected in some way.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:48.099
The next really important thing
is the smallness of Judea.

00:45:48.099 --> 00:45:50.934
From the modern world we tend
to think of Jerusalem and Judea

00:45:50.934 --> 00:45:53.818
as being very important because
of course that's where Judaism

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:56.559
started off and that's where
Christianity started off.

00:45:56.559 --> 00:45:59.871
But by the standards of the
Greek and Roman worlds,

00:45:59.871 --> 00:46:02.920
Judea was a kind of
insignificant backwater.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.592
It wasn't a big important place
economically or politically,

00:46:06.592 --> 00:46:09.579
and Jerusalem was not that
terribly important.

00:46:09.579 --> 00:46:11.722
Judea was relatively
unimportant from a world

00:46:11.722 --> 00:46:14.603
historical perspective,
but--and this is also very

00:46:14.603 --> 00:46:18.266
important for how this lecture
plays out for the rest of the

00:46:18.266 --> 00:46:20.697
course--
the Jews were never truly

00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:24.960
independent during this time nor
were they ever truly powerful

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.360
during this time.
 

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.677
Even when the Hasmoneans,
Judas Maccabeus and his

00:46:28.677 --> 00:46:32.342
brothers and their descendants,
were ruling for 100 years or

00:46:32.342 --> 00:46:36.675
so, they never were politically
very powerful outside of that

00:46:36.675 --> 00:46:38.409
narrow area of Judea.
 

00:46:38.409 --> 00:46:41.340
They were never truly
independent;

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.170
they always had to fend off the
greater power of Syria,

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:46.590
or Egypt, or Rome.
 

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:50.590
The difference--the important
thing, though,

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:56.360
is Jews had an ideology that
supported imperial pretensions.

00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:59.010
Go back and read the first few
Psalms,

00:46:59.010 --> 00:47:01.878
where God says,
"To my anointed one,"

00:47:01.878 --> 00:47:05.309
and here he's either talking to
King David or whoever is

00:47:05.309 --> 00:47:08.489
supposed to be sitting on King
David's throne,

00:47:08.489 --> 00:47:11.659
"You are the King of the
world.

00:47:11.659 --> 00:47:14.123
I will make all the nations
flow to Jerusalem,

00:47:14.123 --> 00:47:16.753
all of them will come and
worship Me in this holy

00:47:16.753 --> 00:47:17.630
place."
 

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.853
The Psalms are full of language
that implied that whoever is in

00:47:21.853 --> 00:47:24.920
control in Jerusalem is the king
of world,

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.449
and yet the Jews looked around
themselves and they're going,

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:32.139
we haven't had anybody who
approached that in centuries.

00:47:32.139 --> 00:47:37.157
The Jews had an ideology of
empire and world domination

00:47:37.157 --> 00:47:41.945
embedded in their scripture,
and yet their social and

00:47:41.945 --> 00:47:45.440
political situation was just the
opposite,

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:50.371
and it's in that maelstrom of
Jewish ideology not fitting

00:47:50.371 --> 00:47:55.949
reality,
that Jesus is born.

00:47:55.949 --> 00:47:59.320
No sections this week.
 

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.750
Look at the syllabus.
 

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:04.289
On Monday you'll be asked to
come in with lists of historical

00:48:04.289 --> 00:48:07.829
events as you see them in Acts
and lists of historical events

00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:10.250
as you see them in Galatians 1
and 2.

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:13.032
Come in with your lists on
paper because we're going to put

00:48:13.032 --> 00:48:14.039
it up on the board.
 

00:48:14.039 --> 00:48:16.862
Be prepared to tell me what you
do for your homework,

00:48:16.862 --> 00:48:18.545
and do the homework for Monday.
 

00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:18.980
Okay?
 

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.295
It's not very difficult;
it won't take you a long time,

00:48:22.295 --> 00:48:25.702
but follow the syllabus
instructions and come Monday

00:48:25.702 --> 00:48:26.840
ready to talk.

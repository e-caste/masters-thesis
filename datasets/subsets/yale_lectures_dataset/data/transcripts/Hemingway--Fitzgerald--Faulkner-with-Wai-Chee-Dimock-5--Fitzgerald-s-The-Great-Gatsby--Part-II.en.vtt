WAI CHEE DIMOCK: Last
time, we talked about the

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.700
odd presence of race in
The Great Gatsby.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.867
Even though there's no
African-American character in

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.700
iThe Great Gatsby/i, there's an
undercurrent of allusions

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.800
to race, especially in that
seemingly gratuitous scene

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.967
when Nick and Gatsby are going
to town in Gatsby's car, and

00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:32.500
they see this other car with
two black men and one black

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.633
woman in a car driven by
a white chauffeur.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:38.967
So that's a very odd, gratuitous
reference.

00:00:38.967 --> 00:00:42.367
And I just want to pick
up on that and push

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.500
that a little further.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.833
Because there actually is a more
important connection of

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.933
African-American music,

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:54.200
actually, being very important.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.100
And I would say that jazz
started out as and is still

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.567
very much African-American
music.

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:05.200
So Fitzgerald has written an
essay-- this is after The

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.633
Great Gatsby--

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:12.233
but 1931 essay called, "Echoes
of the Jazz Age." And he says,

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:17.000
"It was an age of miracles, it
was an age of art, it was an

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.167
age of excess, and it was
an age of satire."

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.967
So a lot of those terms,
"miracles"--

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.300
you guys will probably
know this--

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.633
there's a very strong religious
language, language

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.367
of Christianity--

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:36.600
"son of God"--

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.300
religious language in
The Great Gatsby.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.167
And miracles would be within
that domain of religious

00:01:44.167 --> 00:01:49.433
allusions, but obviously
being remapped

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:51.867
onto a secular context.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:55.000
But certainly Gatsby is someone
who would believe in

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.967
miracles, the miracle of
turning time back and

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:03.833
completely erasing a few
years of Daisy's life.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:08.000
That's the miracle that
he wants to achieve.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.767
So miracles, what Fitzgerald
associates with the Jazz Age,

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.667
very much is a very important
term for The Great Gatsby.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.667
Excess, we know about, and
age of art as well.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:22.367
And there's actually
an allusion.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:26.767
When Nick goes to Gatsby's
party, the music that was

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:32.800
playing is actually the "Jazz
History of the World." So lots

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.500
of cross-references, basically a
kind of a web, a musical web

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.267
that's being woven into The
Great Gatsby, with jazz being

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:46.700
the genetic ground
of that web.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.967
And jazz really was important
to the 1920s, not just to

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:59.700
Fitzgerald but to the entire
decade, so I just want to

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.967
bring up some other
important figures.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:05.900
The piece called "(What Did I Do
to Be So) Black and Blue,"

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.767
that's an especially
resonant piece.

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:12.600
It started out with Fats Waller
singing it in "Ain't

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.100
Misbehaving." And then it was
picked up, both played on the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.967
trumpet but also sung
by Louis Armstrong.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:40.367
And then there's an allusion
to Louis Armstrong in Ralph

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.833
Ellison's Invisible Man.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:49.467
And for some reason, that is not
showing up here, so I must

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.500
have erased that when I was
getting ready for this.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.667
So I'll just read this to you.

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:58.733
This is the opening of Ralph
Ellison's Invisible Man.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:02.800
"Then somehow I came out of
it, ascending hastily from

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.267
this underground of sound
to hear Louis Armstrong

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:12.367
innocently asking, 'What did I
do to be so black and blue?'"

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:17.067
So it very much is something
that started out in music and

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:24.100
then crossed over into
literature and basically was

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.200
the underlying conceit for Ralph
Ellison's Invisible Man.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.800
I'll put this back on the
PowerPoint when I post it to

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.367
the website.

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:37.467
Oh, it's right here.

00:04:37.467 --> 00:04:39.033
My computer is playing
tricks on me.

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:45.367
So this is the passage, and
we can talk about music as

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:50.533
furnishing a chromatic
spectrum to

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.200
a linguistic medium.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.700
We don't think of language
necessarily as having colors,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.867
but language very much has
colors in The Great Gatsby.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:04.800
It's very, very striking.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.400
Blue garden, yellow music,
the blue honey of the

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.400
Mediterranean, numerous
instances of color being used

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:21.100
in very abstract ways as
operation, basic operation of

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.733
the linguistic medium.

00:05:24.733 --> 00:05:31.767
So based on this, the
cross-mapping of music onto

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:39.400
language and the generation of
color as well, it's very, very

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.967
odd that sight and sound are
being combined in this

00:05:44.967 --> 00:05:46.267
cross-mapping.

00:05:46.267 --> 00:05:50.567
So I want to bring this back to
the word that we heard last

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:54.833
time from Maxwell Perkins, his
complaint, really, that The

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:58.600
Great Gatsby is very vague,
that not enough physical

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.133
details, not enough info,
really, about Gatsby.

00:06:03.133 --> 00:06:06.467
And last time we talked about
it in terms of what I would

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:09.233
call counter-realism.

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:13.533
And today, I would like to
talk about that, that

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:16.533
sensation of vagueness.

00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:18.900
I would like to talk about
that in terms of a

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.000
cross-mapping of sight and
sound, because this is not

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.067
something that we
do all the time.

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.500
It's not common usage.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.067
It can create impression of
vagueness, even though once we

00:06:30.067 --> 00:06:35.200
get used to it, it's just a
wonderful strategy that

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.500
Fitzgerald is using.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.633
So the three headings that
I'd like to use for this

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:45.267
cross-mapping is, first of all,

00:06:45.267 --> 00:06:47.500
auditory field with colors.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.267
We've already seen a little bit
of that when Fitzgerald is

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:57.400
seemingly talking about sound,
but colors are operative in

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.067
those descriptions.

00:06:59.067 --> 00:07:04.267
And then the obverse of that,
the visual field with sound or

00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:05.733
with noise, lots of noise.

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:12.233
The same, exactly symmetrical to
that, but happening on the

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.367
visual end.

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:19.033
And then the third-- really,
this is the central structure

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:22.333
that I'd like to talk
about today--

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:27.567
is this visual-auditory coupling
as thematic coupling.

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:32.200
So first of all, we see two
characters in the same visual

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.533
or the same auditory tableau,
two people seemingly

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:38.333
accidentally being
paired together.

00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:39.333
We just see them together.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:43.000
That's the visual impact
of that image.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.567
And it turns out that that
visual logic, that visual mode

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:53.700
of association actually has
thematic implications.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.533
So the visual-auditory coupling
turning into a

00:07:57.533 --> 00:08:00.667
thematic coupling, it's a very
complicated structure, but I

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:03.267
do think that this is something
that Fitzgerald

00:08:03.267 --> 00:08:04.900
works very hard to create.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:12.400
And this is one of the just
miraculous, I would say,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.233
architectural features
of the novel.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:19.200
So first, let's just
think about the

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.833
auditory field with colors.

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:26.267
And this is actually just still
at Gatsby's party and

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:30.767
Nick talking about what he hears
there, but something

00:08:30.767 --> 00:08:31.700
else as well.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.567
"The lights grow brighter as
the Earth lurches away from

00:08:35.567 --> 00:08:40.033
the Sun, and now the orchestra
is playing yellow cocktail

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:46.033
music, and the opera of voices
pitches a key higher."

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:48.633
So he's really hearing
the music.

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.167
This is the occasion when the
"Jazz History of the World" is

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:53.833
being played.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:57.533
But it seems that it's
impossible to talk about

00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:02.033
qualities of sound without
thinking of visual images.

00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:07.067
And not even visual images of
the people who were there,

00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.667
although certainly there are
plenty of descriptions of

00:09:09.667 --> 00:09:10.267
those people.

00:09:10.267 --> 00:09:15.367
But right now, it's a
very, very cosmic

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:18.267
vision of the world.

00:09:18.267 --> 00:09:21.967
"The Earth lurches away from the
Sun." It's on that kind of

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:27.800
cosmic scale, astronomical
scale, that the yellow

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.700
cocktail music is
pitching into.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.967
So really the cosmic reference
is coming out of nowhere, and

00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:38.300
that was very surprising.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:42.067
And I'm not sure what to say
about it other than that it

00:09:42.067 --> 00:09:44.633
seems very deliberate on
Fitzgerald's part.

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:49.167
So once again, lots and lots of
really interesting details

00:09:49.167 --> 00:09:55.167
and packed moments that invite
us, basically, compel us, to

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:57.600
give interpretation to.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.367
So this is one end
of the spectrum,

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.000
auditory field with colors.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.233
And so let's go to the other end
of the spectrum, visual,

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:10.000
optical field with noise.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.933
And this is, once again, very
early, when Nick goes to the

00:10:14.933 --> 00:10:16.700
Buchanan household for
the first time.

00:10:19.867 --> 00:10:20.867
Daisy is his cousin.

00:10:20.867 --> 00:10:23.000
He hasn't seen her
for a while.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.400
The first image that he has of
Daisy is actually not of Daisy

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:34.167
alone, but she's on this couch
with another young woman.

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:38.733
"The only completely stationary
object in the room

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:43.900
was an enormous couch on which
two young women were buoyed up

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:49.267
as though upon an anchored
balloon.

00:10:49.267 --> 00:10:52.467
They were both in white, and
their dresses were rippling

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:56.100
and fluttering as if they had
just been blown back in after

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:59.600
a short flight around
the house.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.733
I must have stood for a few
moments listening to the whip

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:05.867
and snap of the curtains
and the groan of a

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:08.167
picture on the wall.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:13.133
Then there was a boom as Tom
Buchanan shut the rear windows

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:17.167
and the caught wind died out
about the room, and the

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:21.233
curtains and the rugs and the
two young women ballooned

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:24.800
slowly to the floor."

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.700
It's an amazing image.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:31.900
And it says a lot the about
Buchanan household.

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.100
It says a lot about Daisy.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:39.067
Basically, it's really
a visual allegory

00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:41.067
for the entire novel.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:46.867
The entire novel of The Great
Gatsby can be seen as Daisy

00:11:46.867 --> 00:11:51.567
ballooning up and taking flight,
going back to that

00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:57.633
earlier romance with Gatsby.

00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.667
But really, it's just a very,
very short trip, and she's

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:05.367
going to be brought down
to Earth by Tom.

00:12:05.367 --> 00:12:11.633
So it's really interesting
that there should be this

00:12:11.633 --> 00:12:17.867
intensification of what might
seem a very neutral or very

00:12:17.867 --> 00:12:21.633
casual visual image into
something that carries

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:23.667
tremendous thematic weight.

00:12:23.667 --> 00:12:27.600
This is basically the whole
story of The Great Gatsby is

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.467
being encapsulated in this
one visual image.

00:12:32.467 --> 00:12:36.833
And what allows this visual
image to have such tremendous

00:12:36.833 --> 00:12:39.400
thematic weight is actually
an intrusion of

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.100
sound into that image.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.267
If there had not been sound,
it would not have been so

00:12:47.267 --> 00:12:48.900
pregnant with meaning.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.300
And the sound has to
do with the whip

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.900
and snap of the curtains.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.600
It's just remarkable
words to use.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.533
Curtains, they don't make sounds
like a whip, or they

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:07.033
don't make snapping sounds.

00:13:07.033 --> 00:13:10.900
So clearly, this is the
superimposition of something

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.900
else much more brutal, much
more violent images, being

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.867
superimposed--

00:13:18.867 --> 00:13:21.833
auditory images being
superimposed upon the

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.533
otherwise very benign
and very harmless

00:13:24.533 --> 00:13:26.867
sound made by the curtain.

00:13:26.867 --> 00:13:33.233
So already, the whip and the
snap already paving the

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:36.133
auditory ground for the
appearance for Tom Buchanan,

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:39.333
so that when he finally appears
towards the end of the

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:41.967
passage, it's almost
not surprising.

00:13:41.967 --> 00:13:45.100
Even though he doesn't show up
until the last sentence of the

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.800
passage, the snap and
whip of the curtains

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.567
already carry his signature.

00:13:51.567 --> 00:13:54.867
So it's real interesting that
Tom Buchanan is a very

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.100
physical man.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:59.267
We know him by his physical
attributes, his body filling

00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:03.267
up every inch of his clothes,
his riding boots, and so on, a

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:04.533
very visual figure.

00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:07.800
But nonetheless, Fitzgerald is
careful to give an auditory

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.833
dimension to Tom.

00:14:08.833 --> 00:14:12.733
And then the final auditory act
that he does is to bring

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:14.333
down, shut the rear window.

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.900
This is not the rear door, but
it's the rear window, almost

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.633
as though somebody is trying to
get into his house by the

00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:22.400
back door or the back window.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.300
And Tom Buchanan is shutting
that right then and there

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.600
before any action
has taken place.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.467
So this is a forecast of
the rest of the novel.

00:14:32.467 --> 00:14:35.700
Basically, it's just a capsule
summary of everything that we

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.433
need to know about
The Great Gatsby.

00:14:38.433 --> 00:14:43.100
So just to see how carefully
crafted this is--

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.800
because this is already made,
because this comes to us

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:52.467
ready-made, we don't notice
how much craftsmanship

00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:55.433
actually goes into
that passage.

00:14:55.433 --> 00:14:59.700
So I just wanted to show you a
visual image that is almost

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.533
similar to this by a very
famous painter, Manet.

00:15:04.533 --> 00:15:06.767
And this is a picture called

00:15:06.767 --> 00:15:09.433
Baudelaire's Mistress,
Reclining.

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:12.300
We also see the curtains
in there.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.867
But we just know that those
curtains are not going to make

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:21.100
a noise like a whip, or they're
not going to be making

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.867
whipping or snapping sounds.

00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:25.500
So this is in contrast
to Fitzgerald.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.933
This is a visual field
without noise.

00:15:27.933 --> 00:15:30.300
It is completely visual.

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:36.533
It doesn't carry the auditory
signature and auditory menace

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:41.500
that is encoded in Fitzgerald's
very careful

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.567
coupling of sight and sound
in his description.

00:15:45.567 --> 00:15:52.800
So we also know that Daisy
doesn't appear by herself, so

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.867
it's very, very important that
she and Jordan Baker--

00:15:56.867 --> 00:16:01.200
that the first glimpse that we
have is of the two of them on

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.833
that enormous couch, and both
occupants of a visual field

00:16:06.833 --> 00:16:09.033
that carries noise.

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:12.933
So that is the first common
thing between

00:16:12.933 --> 00:16:15.233
Jordan Baker and Daisy.

00:16:15.233 --> 00:16:20.300
Let's go on to see if that
visual-auditory coupling--

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.833
what does that mean
in thematic terms?

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:27.533
How does that translate into
features of the plot that

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:31.033
maybe will also bring the
two of them together?

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.933
So I'm telling you what I'm--

00:16:32.933 --> 00:16:35.633
I'm going to argue this, just
the outline of the lecture,

00:16:35.633 --> 00:16:39.100
and then we'll do the
same thing with

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.100
Gatsby and Nick as well.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:46.600
But let's just move on
to Jordan Baker.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.000
And last time, we talked about
the importance of the car, of

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Gatsby's Rolls-Royce.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.067
And the car really is a key
player in The Great Gatsby in

00:16:57.067 --> 00:16:58.900
all kinds of contexts.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:05.533
So it turns out that Jordan
Baker, one very important

00:17:05.533 --> 00:17:08.500
aspect of her relation
to Nick actually

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.567
revolves around the car.

00:17:11.567 --> 00:17:15.933
"It was on that same house party
that we had a curious

00:17:15.933 --> 00:17:19.100
conversation about
driving a car.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:23.733
It started because she passed so
close to some workmen that

00:17:23.733 --> 00:17:28.500
our fender flicked a button
on one man's coat.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.133
'You're a rotten driver,'
I protested.

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:34.200
'Either you ought to be more
careful, or you oughtn't to

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.267
drive at all.' 'I am careful.'
'No, you're not.' 'Well, other

00:17:38.267 --> 00:17:39.967
people are,' she said lightly.

00:17:39.967 --> 00:17:42.900
'What's that got to do with it?'
'They'll keep out of my

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.300
way,' she insisted.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.633
'It takes two to make
an accident.'"

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:53.667
So this says a lot about the
relation between Nick and

00:17:53.667 --> 00:17:57.133
Jordan Baker and why it
might come to nothing.

00:17:57.133 --> 00:18:01.233
So there are actually lots of
little, local allegories of

00:18:01.233 --> 00:18:05.700
the entire plot all the way
throughout The Great Gatsby.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:11.833
And the fact that she's a bad
driver who's counting on other

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:15.933
people being careful to
prevent accidents from

00:18:15.933 --> 00:18:20.167
happening, that is not
a good basis to get

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:21.633
into a marriage with.

00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:25.100
And Nick seems to know that, so
this is really one of the

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.333
many signs that this is not
going to come to anything.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:33.467
But what is also interesting, I
think, about this particular

00:18:33.467 --> 00:18:38.500
image of Jordan Baker coming by
way of her relation to the

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:45.600
automobile is a notion of
accountability that is perhaps

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.667
not just limited to Jordan
Baker herself.

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:55.200
It is really an account, an
explanation of why things go

00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:00.633
wrong and one's responsibility,
one's input,

00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:05.600
one's contribution to the fact
that something is going wrong.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:10.567
And for Jordan Baker,
accountability is almost

00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:14.333
always written over
to the other side.

00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:18.067
If there's an accident, it's
because the other person isn't

00:19:18.067 --> 00:19:19.267
a good driver.

00:19:19.267 --> 00:19:23.233
That's why there's an accident,
not taking into

00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:26.067
account at all the fact that
she's also a bad driver.

00:19:26.067 --> 00:19:31.200
She's right that it takes two
to make an accident, but the

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.700
explanation that she's looking
for is that it is another

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.167
person's fault.

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:40.467
And we'll see that there're
other characters in the novel

00:19:40.467 --> 00:19:45.600
who share that understanding of
accountability, kind of a

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.300
straight attribution of fault
to the other side.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.933
So let's see how Daisy
relates to the car.

00:19:55.933 --> 00:19:59.533
And it turns out that she also
has a very, extremely

00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:02.767
nontrivial relation
to the car.

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:06.900
This is while they're leaving
that terrible scene in New

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.700
York, when basically Gatsby
is just falling apart.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.900
But Tom allows him to
drive Daisy back.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:20.433
So Gatsby and Daisy are in the
car, and this is Gatsby

00:20:20.433 --> 00:20:22.400
telling Nick what happened.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.800
"When we left New York, she
was very nervous, and she

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.933
thought it would steady
her to drive.

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:32.667
And this woman rushed out at us
just as we were passing a

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:35.267
car coming the other way.

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:39.367
It all happened in a minute, but
it seemed to me that she

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:44.733
wanted to speak to us, thought
we were somebody she knew.

00:20:44.733 --> 00:20:48.567
Well, first Daisy turned away
from the woman toward the

00:20:48.567 --> 00:20:53.733
other car, and then she lost
her nerve and turned back."

00:20:53.733 --> 00:20:59.433
So that's the death of Myrtle
at the hand of Daisy.

00:20:59.433 --> 00:21:02.100
And it is not intentional.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:07.067
And I think that this says
a lot about Daisy.

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:13.067
Fitzgerald is not portraying
a bad person, really.

00:21:13.067 --> 00:21:17.533
She is a bad driver because
she's lost her nerve.

00:21:17.533 --> 00:21:20.800
And we really have to be
pretty careful in our

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800
assignment of blame.

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.400
I think that Jordan Baker has
a very, almost too clear

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.267
assignment of blame in putting
it squarely on the other

00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:31.333
person's side.

00:21:31.333 --> 00:21:37.200
And Fitzgerald is actually quite
careful about saying

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.233
what kind of a woman Daisy is.

00:21:40.233 --> 00:21:44.800
She's just not a very brave
person, and she's not a very

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.067
feisty person.

00:21:46.067 --> 00:21:53.133
She doesn't have sturdiness of
nerve, and she loses her nerve

00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:56.933
at a critical moment, both at
this very critical moment but

00:21:56.933 --> 00:22:02.500
also in a kind of abstract way
when Gatsby needed her to

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.933
stand by him.

00:22:03.933 --> 00:22:06.500
She's really not
there for him.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.967
So this is the kind of person
she is, and it comes out most

00:22:10.967 --> 00:22:14.967
dramatically in her handling
of the car.

00:22:14.967 --> 00:22:19.000
But it also comes out in the
way that she handles other

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.033
affairs of life as well.

00:22:22.033 --> 00:22:27.000
So in all those ways, we see
the same logic that we saw

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.467
last time-- that is, very
important human attributes are

00:22:31.467 --> 00:22:37.133
rooted, are channeled through
our relation to objects.

00:22:37.133 --> 00:22:40.867
Daisy's relation to the car says
a lot about how she would

00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:46.800
behave in other strictly human
contexts of interaction.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:51.400
So Jordan Baker and Daisy were
joined together at the very

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.000
beginning by virtue of
that visual tableau.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.800
And it turns out that it
actually is a very deep

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:57.367
connection.

00:22:57.367 --> 00:23:00.233
They're both bad drivers,
although for bad reasons.

00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:02.500
So we have to be careful
as well.

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.433
They're both bad drivers, but
in the case of Jordan Baker,

00:23:05.433 --> 00:23:08.433
she's just much more cavalier
about the whole thing, whereas

00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:12.333
Daisy is just incompetent
and not very

00:23:12.333 --> 00:23:15.167
skilled and lacking nerve.

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:20.600
So let's turn back now
to another coupling.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.800
And you guys will notice that
I'm not talking about Gatsby

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.767
and Daisy, the most obvious
couple in The Great Gatsby.

00:23:28.767 --> 00:23:33.900
But I want to talk about that
couple in a roundabout fashion

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.133
actually, by way of
Nick and Gatsby.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:41.267
And I just want to go back to
one very small point that we

00:23:41.267 --> 00:23:46.400
talked about much earlier, which
is about the legacy of

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.667
World War I.

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:52.100
So we know that Nick and Gatsby
have this in common.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.667
They both fought in World War
I, and they both named the

00:23:57.667 --> 00:23:59.800
units that they were in.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.667
So Nick was in the Ninth Machine
Gun Battalion, and

00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:06.367
Gatsby was in the Seventh
Infantry.

00:24:06.367 --> 00:24:10.367
Very precise in naming the
number of that unit.

00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:14.500
So already, we know that there's
a prior connection

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.467
between the two of them.

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:19.733
And I would argue that they
also have an ongoing

00:24:19.733 --> 00:24:24.600
connection as well, because
they are both very, very

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.633
sensitive to, responsive to,
and captivated by a certain

00:24:29.633 --> 00:24:33.667
quality of sound that resides
in Daisy's voice.

00:24:33.667 --> 00:24:38.800
So it's very, very odd that
Nick, who has no romantic

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.767
attachment to Daisy, should be
captivated in almost exactly

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:46.400
the same way that Gatsby
is captivated.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.667
It doesn't actually take a
romantic attachment for it to

00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:52.800
be completely within
the powers of a

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.300
certain quality of voice.

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.967
So Nick talking about
Daisy's voice.

00:24:57.967 --> 00:25:03.000
"It was the kind of voice that
the ear follows up and down,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.633
as if each speech is an
arrangement of notes that will

00:25:06.633 --> 00:25:08.833
never be played again.

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:12.433
Her face was sad and lovely
with bright things in it,

00:25:12.433 --> 00:25:15.467
bright eyes and a bright
passionate mouth.

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:19.567
But there was an excitement in
her voice that men who had

00:25:19.567 --> 00:25:23.300
cared for her found difficult
to forget, a singing

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.233
compulsion, a whispered,
'Listen.'"

00:25:27.233 --> 00:25:34.033
When we look at the visual
description of Daisy, it's not

00:25:34.033 --> 00:25:35.233
very striking.

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:38.767
Fitzgerald is using very,
very generic words

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:39.867
to talk about Daisy.

00:25:39.867 --> 00:25:43.433
Her face is "sad and lovely
with bright things in it."

00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:48.967
Almost no actual description
of the physical features on

00:25:48.967 --> 00:25:49.833
Daisy's face.

00:25:49.833 --> 00:25:54.500
So it actually is a very
vague image of Daisy.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.400
We know that supposedly she's
beautiful, but we don't

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.300
actually know the
exact features

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.100
that render her beautiful.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:08.867
It is her voice that gives a
very exact rendition of Daisy.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:12.067
It is a voice that nobody can
forget, that nobody who cares

00:26:12.067 --> 00:26:14.333
about her can forget.

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:18.933
And in this case, it is really
the intimation of mortality.

00:26:18.933 --> 00:26:21.600
And I think that voice--

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.000
well, now we can capture--

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.733
obviously, sound recording
makes that less of an

00:26:29.733 --> 00:26:31.033
intimation of mortality.

00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:35.233
But if it's just a voice that
you hear for that one moment

00:26:35.233 --> 00:26:39.200
and you never hear it again,
you do have the sense that

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.567
it's just that one time,
and it will never

00:26:43.567 --> 00:26:45.800
again be heard again.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.867
If you go to a concert that's
not being recorded, then you

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:50.433
just know that this is it.

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:52.267
Once it's gone, it's gone.

00:26:52.267 --> 00:26:57.333
And so that partly accounts for
the compulsion that comes

00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:04.333
from Daisy's voice, that it both
is an intimation of her

00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:08.167
mortality, and it's an
intimation of mortality on the

00:27:08.167 --> 00:27:11.067
part of the person who's
listening to her.

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:15.233
Let's look at one another
description of Daisy's voice

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:17.600
coming from Nick.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.667
This is something that we
actually read before, but I

00:27:20.667 --> 00:27:22.600
just thought that I would
read it again.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.933
"For a moment, the last sunshine
fell with romantic

00:27:25.933 --> 00:27:28.867
affection upon her
glowing face.

00:27:28.867 --> 00:27:32.967
Her voice compelled me forward
breathlessly as I listened.

00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:36.533
Then the glow faded, each
light deserting her with

00:27:36.533 --> 00:27:40.067
lingering regret, like children
leaving a pleasant

00:27:40.067 --> 00:27:42.033
street at dusk."

00:27:42.033 --> 00:27:45.300
And this is actually in
the context of Nick--

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.900
this is the visit to the
Buchanan household, and Nick

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.233
is just about to find out about

00:27:51.233 --> 00:27:53.367
Tom's affair with Myrtle.

00:27:53.367 --> 00:28:00.667
So in some sense, the fading
light is also a prelude, or

00:28:00.667 --> 00:28:05.800
perhaps even an allegory, of the
rapidly fading light, even

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:09.567
in the course of that evening,
as the phone rings, all the

00:28:09.567 --> 00:28:13.033
light goes out of
everyone's face.

00:28:13.033 --> 00:28:21.800
And so it's the quality of sound
that registers dramatic

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.867
development in that episode.

00:28:24.867 --> 00:28:30.900
So as I said, Nick really
doesn't have a deep relation

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.667
to Daisy, but he
has a very deep

00:28:33.667 --> 00:28:36.500
relation to Daisy's voice.

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.400
And Gatsby, who has a very deep
relation to Daisy, also

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.900
has a very deep relation to
Daisy's voice as well.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.333
And this is the moment when he's
meeting Daisy after all

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:51.667
these years in Nick's house.

00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:55.133
And we'll read that passage
a little later.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:29:00.667
But Nick conjectures that he's
been keeping her in his heart

00:29:00.667 --> 00:29:03.300
for so long that this
is actually not the

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.000
big moment for him.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
This is actually the moment of
the letdown, that here is this

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.767
woman he's been waiting for
all these years, doing

00:29:11.767 --> 00:29:14.300
everything, building up his
whole life towards this

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.067
moment, and it's a letdown.

00:29:18.067 --> 00:29:22.800
And so Nick is noticing that in
Gatsby, and then something

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.267
else happens.

00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:28.867
"As I watched him, he adjusted
himself visibly.

00:29:28.867 --> 00:29:33.833
His hand took hold of hers, and
as she said something low

00:29:33.833 --> 00:29:39.567
in his ear, he turned toward
her with a rush of emotion.

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:44.633
I think that voice held him
most, with its fluctuating,

00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:49.433
feverish warmth, because it
couldn't be over-dreamed.

00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:53.100
That voice was a deathless
song."

00:29:53.100 --> 00:30:00.267
So everything else about Daisy
actually could be, and is,

00:30:00.267 --> 00:30:04.967
over-dreamed, and Gatsby almost
knows that, that he's

00:30:04.967 --> 00:30:09.633
projected much too much onto
Daisy, that there's no way she

00:30:09.633 --> 00:30:13.433
can live up to all the
projections of all those years

00:30:13.433 --> 00:30:16.233
that he's been involving
her in.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.900
No human being--it's not just
that Daisy can't live up to

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.100
that kind of massive projection

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.900
on the part of Gatsby.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.767
No human being can.

00:30:27.767 --> 00:30:33.700
But one thing about Daisy
can stand up to that

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.267
magnification, emotional
magnification and

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:42.533
amplification on the part of
Gatsby, and that is her voice.

00:30:42.533 --> 00:30:46.633
Every time, any time he hears
her voice, he's captivated by

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:50.167
her over and over again, as if
everything is really starting

00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:51.600
at that moment.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.533
So the voice for Daisy captures
the possibility of

00:30:55.533 --> 00:30:56.967
fresh beginning.

00:30:56.967 --> 00:30:58.600
It seems to have
come to an end.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.700
It seems to have arrived at
the moment where Gatsby is

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.100
finally disillusioned
with Daisy.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.033
And then he hears that voice
again, and it's almost as if

00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:09.033
there's a fresh start.

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:11.800
And this is really what
Fitzgerald talks about, about

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.200
the new world and the "fresh,
green breast of the new world"

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.733
at the very end of The Great
Gatsby is that some people

00:31:18.733 --> 00:31:25.100
actually have the capability
for endless new beginnings.

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:29.633
You think that they've come to
the end of the road or that

00:31:29.633 --> 00:31:33.000
they come to the end of the
dream, and all of a sudden,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.567
they're starting up
all over again.

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:38.467
And that's really what's
impressive about Gatsby--

00:31:38.467 --> 00:31:42.833
sad and pathetic about Gatsby as
well, but also impressive--

00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:45.100
is that he can always
start again.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:50.167
That passion for Gatsby can
always start afresh because of

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.633
the quality of Daisy's sound.

00:31:52.633 --> 00:31:56.800
But Gatsby is not so captivated
or so blindly in

00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:03.167
love that he doesn't know what
is in that voice, what

00:32:03.167 --> 00:32:07.800
constitutes that voice, or
what gives the voice its

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.000
magical power.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.900
So this is actually a
surprisingly cleared-eye

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.967
evaluation of Daisy's
voice from Gatsby.

00:32:16.967 --> 00:32:22.300
"'Her voice is full of money,'
he said suddenly.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.367
That was it.

00:32:23.367 --> 00:32:25.767
I never understood before.

00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:27.267
It was full of money.

00:32:27.267 --> 00:32:31.200
That was the inexhaustible charm
that rose and fell in

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:35.100
it, the jingle of it, the
cymbals' song of it.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:39.067
High in a white palace, the
king's daughter, the golden

00:32:39.067 --> 00:32:40.200
girl."

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:45.500
So usually people who are madly
in love are not so great

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.200
at analyzing the nature of the
object that they love.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.000
But in a surprising move,
Gatsby actually is very

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.500
analytical here and completely
right, that that really is the

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:03.867
power of Daisy, that in some
sense, she is the golden girl,

00:33:03.867 --> 00:33:06.967
in a very literal sense, that it
is the gold that makes for

00:33:06.967 --> 00:33:10.767
that goldenness of Daisy.

00:33:10.767 --> 00:33:14.533
That's really what creates
her, that gives her her

00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:20.633
initial magic over Gatsby when
he was just a poor, young boy.

00:33:20.633 --> 00:33:25.533
And that's what makes for the
continual magic of Daisy,

00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:32.667
that, yes, this is an age of
miracle, as Fitzgerald says

00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:39.700
about jazz, but it is an age of
miracle underwritten by the

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:43.800
miracle-creating
power of gold.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.067
This is really what the novel is
about is this magic in this

00:33:48.067 --> 00:33:52.867
world, but it's coming from
basically an inanimate,

00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:55.600
nonhuman source.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.500
And a human being can quite
often be the creation of that

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.467
miracle-working substance,
gold.

00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:10.800
So, so far, we've seen the two
of them being completely

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.467
captivated by Daisy's voice.

00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:17.900
But Nick and Gatsby also have
something else in common as

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:23.467
well, in that even though sound
is what keeps them going

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:27.367
for a good part of the novel,
actually, at some point, sound

00:34:27.367 --> 00:34:29.767
is also extinguished for them.

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:33.367
So let's look at the mode
by which sound is being

00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:35.767
extinguished for each of them.

00:34:35.767 --> 00:34:38.800
And not surprisingly, those come
at the end of the novel,

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.400
because when sound is
extinguished, that's also a

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.700
signal that the novel
is coming to an end.

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:50.200
So here is Nick actually
watching Tom and Daisy after

00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.067
the accident when Tom and Daisy
are back in the house.

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:56.467
And Nick is outside, and so he's
watching the two of them.

00:34:56.467 --> 00:34:59.567
And all he can see is this
visual tableau of Tom and

00:34:59.567 --> 00:35:02.367
Daisy, but he can't hear
what they are saying.

00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:05.600
And I think we can really
actually get a more dramatic

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.767
moment when you can only
see but not hear.

00:35:08.767 --> 00:35:12.400
"Daisy and Tom were sitting
opposite each other at the

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.867
kitchen table, with a plate of
cold fried chicken between

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:18.400
them and two bottles of ale.

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.600
He was talking intently across
the table at her, and in his

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.800
earnestness, his hand
had fallen upon

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.533
and covered her own.

00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:30.600
Once in a while, she
looked up at him

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.367
and nodded in agreement.

00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:36.400
They weren't happy, and neither
of them had touched

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.300
the chicken or the ale.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.000
And yet they weren't
unhappy either.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.433
There was an unmistakable air of
natural intimacy about the

00:35:46.433 --> 00:35:50.300
picture, and anybody would
have said that they were

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.267
conspiring together."

00:35:51.267 --> 00:35:56.033
So this actually is the "happy
ending," in heavy quotation

00:35:56.033 --> 00:36:02.033
marks, for Daisy and Tom, the
reconstitution of that

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:07.000
marriage that had come under
so much stress from both

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.800
sides, Myrtle and Gatsby.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.067
And this is another way in which
Myrtle and Gatsby are

00:36:13.067 --> 00:36:13.867
linked together.

00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:20.333
They're both people coming from
a different social circle

00:36:20.333 --> 00:36:22.267
trying to destroy
that marriage.

00:36:22.267 --> 00:36:24.767
They are not successful.

00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:26.800
The marriage survives.

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:29.467
And this is the comedy,
this is the happy

00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:31.933
ending for Tom and Daisy.

00:36:31.933 --> 00:36:34.733
And the nature of
that comedy--

00:36:34.733 --> 00:36:37.000
and obviously, I'm being
very ironic here--

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.900
the nature of the comedy
is that it's

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.900
just the two of them.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.500
So really, the marriage is
between the two of them.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.200
Even her cousin can only watch,
but cannot actually

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.633
hear what is being said between
the two of them.

00:36:52.633 --> 00:36:59.367
So this is a happy moment for
Tom and Daisy that for Nick

00:36:59.367 --> 00:37:05.300
has to be experienced as silence
from the part of Daisy

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300
and from Tom.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.300
He's so used to hearing
her voice.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:14.067
In this one instant, he's not
hearing her voice at all, and

00:37:14.067 --> 00:37:15.500
that's because she's
talking to Tom.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.133
She's not talking to Nick.

00:37:17.133 --> 00:37:22.833
So let's look at a comparable,
symmetrical moment of sound

00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:26.767
being extinguished by Gatsby,
and this is a truly

00:37:26.767 --> 00:37:28.033
unforgettable moment.

00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:33.533
And once again, all the objects
that we've seen, all

00:37:33.533 --> 00:37:36.400
the objects that are imported in
the first part of The Great

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.100
Gatsby actually come back and
play a very important part.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:45.700
So the extinguishing of sound
for Gatsby towards the end of

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.700
The Great Gatsby actually comes
by way of the telephone,

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.700
nothing coming through to
him from the telephone.

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:56.667
He was waiting, obviously,
for a call from Daisy.

00:37:56.667 --> 00:38:01.367
"No telephone message arrived,
but the butler went without

00:38:01.367 --> 00:38:05.967
his sleep and waited for it
until 4 o'clock, until long

00:38:05.967 --> 00:38:10.467
after there was anyone to
give it to if it came.

00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:13.233
I have an idea that Gatsby
himself didn't believe it

00:38:13.233 --> 00:38:17.867
would come, and perhaps
he no longer cared.

00:38:17.867 --> 00:38:22.267
If that was true, he must have
felt that he had lost the old

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:27.300
warm world, paid a high price
for living too long with a

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.833
single dream.

00:38:28.833 --> 00:38:33.267
He must have looked up at an
unfamiliar sky through

00:38:33.267 --> 00:38:38.233
frightening leaves and shivered
as he found what a

00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:43.167
grotesque thing a rose is and
how raw the sunlight is upon

00:38:43.167 --> 00:38:46.867
the scarcely created grass."

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:52.967
We see the very carefully
planned transition from the

00:38:52.967 --> 00:38:55.533
silence of the telephone
once again to a

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:58.933
strictly visual tableau.

00:38:58.933 --> 00:39:04.700
So this is exactly symmetrical
to the scene witnessed by

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:11.433
Nick, the suspension,
non-appearance of sound, and

00:39:11.433 --> 00:39:14.700
then the domination of
the visual field.

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:20.467
And now, finally, this is a
visual field without sound.

00:39:20.467 --> 00:39:22.700
It hasn't been the
case before.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.967
It's been a visual
field with sound.

00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:28.167
Here is a moment when we get
the visual field without

00:39:28.167 --> 00:39:31.567
sound, and all of a sudden,
it's a grotesque field.

00:39:31.567 --> 00:39:34.267
We don't tend to think of the
rose as a very grotesque

00:39:34.267 --> 00:39:37.533
thing, but when you're that up
close to the rose, when you're

00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:41.000
seeing it in such minute
features, the rose becomes a

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.300
very grotesque thing, unbearable
to look at, really.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.067
And that's really what
the world is for

00:39:47.067 --> 00:39:48.767
Gatsby at that point.

00:39:48.767 --> 00:39:54.300
So right now, we've talked about
the two of them, Nick

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:58.100
and Gatsby, as if they were
almost exactly alike.

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.967
There's this very
strong symmetry

00:39:59.967 --> 00:40:01.333
between the two of them.

00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:05.067
But obviously, this is really
not exactly our experience of

00:40:05.067 --> 00:40:08.667
those two characters, either,
as we read The Great Gatsby.

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:12.800
The two of them are not so
exactly alike that they are

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.600
interchangeable.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:21.767
So I want now to start another
train of thought that actually

00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:26.400
points to a difference between
Nick and Gatsby.

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:32.033
Nick and Gatsby have a very
important common ground up to

00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:36.767
a certain point, and then they
diverge after that point.

00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:40.333
So let's trace the divergence
between them.

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:45.267
It turns out that sound is
extinguished for Nick in two

00:40:45.267 --> 00:40:46.600
dramatic scenes.

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.900
Not hearing Daisy talking to
Tom, that's one moment.

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.233
But there's another one, not
as dramatic, but equally

00:40:53.233 --> 00:40:56.033
consequential for him.

00:40:56.033 --> 00:41:00.100
And actually, it also comes by
way of a phone conversation.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.333
So at least there's that
symmetry between him and

00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:05.500
Gatsby as well.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.300
But here's Nick talking
to Jordan Baker.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.233
This is after the accident.

00:41:14.233 --> 00:41:17.200
"'Suppose I don't go to
Southampton and come into town

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.333
this afternoon?' 'No, I don't
think this afternoon.' 'Very

00:41:20.333 --> 00:41:23.167
well.' 'It's impossible
this afternoon.

00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:29.767
Various--' We talked like that
for a while, and then abruptly

00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:32.200
we weren't talking any longer.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:36.400
I don't know which of us hung
up with a sharp click, but I

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:39.133
know I didn't care."

00:41:39.133 --> 00:41:45.500
So here too is a phone
conversation that simply turns

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:51.667
into a non-conversation, and
then silence descending on the

00:41:51.667 --> 00:41:52.867
two of them.

00:41:52.867 --> 00:41:57.033
So it seems this scene obviously
is very, very close

00:41:57.033 --> 00:42:01.500
to the silence of the telephone
for Gatsby.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:04.733
But there is a crucial
difference.

00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:09.100
Nick had conjectured earlier
that Gatsby didn't care if the

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.767
phone call came or not, but
that's obviously not true.

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:13.933
How could he not care?

00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:14.800
He was devastated.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.000
It was devastating that there
was no phone call from Daisy.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.567
But this is a moment when Nick
truly doesn't really care.

00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:29.967
And he doesn't care because
of who he is.

00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:35.267
So now we've come to a very
important parting of the ways

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:37.967
between Nick and Gatsby.

00:42:37.967 --> 00:42:41.200
Gatsby is someone who actually
cares so much that it's almost

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.967
as if there's no reason for him
to live after that moment,

00:42:44.967 --> 00:42:47.733
and so it's fitting that he
should die right then and

00:42:47.733 --> 00:42:52.633
there, the plot almost
reflecting his psychology.

00:42:52.633 --> 00:42:57.000
But Nick is someone who doesn't
care and who survives

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.767
in some sense because
he doesn't care.

00:42:59.767 --> 00:43:04.267
So here's a moment to go back
to, something that Fitzgerald

00:43:04.267 --> 00:43:07.500
and Hemingway actually
have in common.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.033
We talked a lot about the
logic of substitution in

00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:14.800
Hemingway, and especially the
picador's horse being the

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.833
substitute for the picador
when a bull is charging.

00:43:18.833 --> 00:43:20.200
So there's a very important
logic of

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.767
substitution in Hemingway.

00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:27.133
And it turns out that there's
also a logic of substitution

00:43:27.133 --> 00:43:32.467
in The Great Gatsby as well,
if only because the word

00:43:32.467 --> 00:43:38.233
"substitute" is actually used by
Fitzgerald, once again in a

00:43:38.233 --> 00:43:40.600
seemingly gratuitous context.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.467
But this is the family history
of Nick Carraway.

00:43:44.467 --> 00:43:49.400
"The actual founder of my line
was my grandfather's brother,

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:56.100
who came here in '51, sent a
substitute to the Civil War,

00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:00.833
and started the wholesale
hardware business that my

00:44:00.833 --> 00:44:03.200
father carries on today."

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.133
This entire passage, when we
first read it, seems to have

00:44:08.133 --> 00:44:11.167
nothing to do with the
rest of the novel.

00:44:11.167 --> 00:44:16.633
Why would we care whether or
not back one generation--

00:44:16.633 --> 00:44:22.233
and not even his grandfather,
but his uncle, grand-uncle--

00:44:22.233 --> 00:44:22.833
sent a substitute?

00:44:22.833 --> 00:44:23.767
He didn't fight.

00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:25.900
So this actually has a
lot in common with

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:26.633
the Hemingway story.

00:44:26.633 --> 00:44:29.233
This is someone who doesn't
fight his own battle.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:33.000
He sends a substitute to fight
for him and to suffer for him

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.133
in the Civil War.

00:44:35.133 --> 00:44:39.500
And then as a consequence of
surviving because of not

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.433
having died in the Civil War,
being able to found a very

00:44:42.433 --> 00:44:44.867
successful hardware business.

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:49.100
So all these details about
Nick's family history, at the

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:54.200
moment when it appears, very
early, the opening pages of

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:58.167
The Great Gatsby, seems simply
just to stand there and to be

00:44:58.167 --> 00:44:59.100
doing nothing.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:07.233
And it's only in hindsight that
we can impute a meaning.

00:45:07.233 --> 00:45:11.667
We can retrospectively impute
a meaning to that original

00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:14.367
seemingly gratuitous detail.

00:45:14.367 --> 00:45:19.600
And it really has to do with the
vital difference between

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.400
Gatsby and Nick.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:26.133
And here is this moment when--
just before Gatsby is

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:28.400
captivated by Daisy's
voice again--

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:35.400
this is the moment of this
illusion but also re-illusion

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:38.733
that Nick is noticing
in Gatsby.

00:45:38.733 --> 00:45:42.600
"There must have been moments
even that afternoon when Daisy

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.067
stumbled short of his dreams,
not through her own fault, but

00:45:47.067 --> 00:45:51.733
because of the colossal vitality
of his illusion.

00:45:51.733 --> 00:45:54.333
It had gone beyond her,
beyond everything.

00:45:54.333 --> 00:45:59.300
He had thrown himself into it
with a creative passion,

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.033
adding to it all the time,
decking it out with every

00:46:03.033 --> 00:46:06.267
bright feather that
drifted his way.

00:46:06.267 --> 00:46:11.167
No amount of fire or freshness
can challenge what a man can

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:14.600
store up in his ghostly
heart."

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:20.267
So this is really why Gatsby is
what he is, is that he has

00:46:20.267 --> 00:46:26.533
this enormous storage capacity
in his ghostly heart.

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:30.833
And Daisy will be stored
there forever.

00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:34.100
It almost doesn't matter who
she is, what she really

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.267
turns out to be.

00:46:35.267 --> 00:46:40.767
And when he finally realized
what she is, it

00:46:40.767 --> 00:46:41.700
almost doesn't matter.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:47.100
It has no relation to reality at
all, because it is strictly

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.800
a dream about Daisy that Gatsby
has stored up in his

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:51.867
own heart and mind.

00:46:51.867 --> 00:46:56.233
So the colossal vitality of
illusion, and that is what's

00:46:56.233 --> 00:47:00.433
deathless about Daisy in
Gatsby's own mind and what

00:47:00.433 --> 00:47:04.633
enables Gatsby to be deathless
to some extent as well, in

00:47:04.633 --> 00:47:08.167
spite of his physical,
biological death.

00:47:08.167 --> 00:47:10.233
With Nick, it's the
other way around.

00:47:10.233 --> 00:47:15.667
So I just wanted to read you why
he doesn't care and why it

00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:19.033
turns out that his family
business is

00:47:19.033 --> 00:47:20.367
the hardware business.

00:47:20.367 --> 00:47:23.767
It is someone who can never
be hurt by anything

00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:25.833
that happens to him.

00:47:25.833 --> 00:47:30.567
"Jordan Baker was incurably
dishonest. She wasn't able to

00:47:30.567 --> 00:47:33.300
endure being at a disadvantage,
and given this

00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:36.133
unwillingness, I suppose she
had begun dealing in

00:47:36.133 --> 00:47:40.033
subterfuges when she was very
young in order to keep that

00:47:40.033 --> 00:47:44.867
cool, insolent smile turned to
the world and yet satisfy the

00:47:44.867 --> 00:47:49.000
demands of her hard,
jaunty body."

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:56.000
We have seen Gatsby be very
analytical about Daisy, that

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.733
her voice is "full of money."
And here is Nick performing a

00:48:01.733 --> 00:48:07.467
comparable analytic operation
on Jordan Baker, that she's

00:48:07.467 --> 00:48:10.600
just incurably dishonest,
she can't bear to lose.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:13.333
She will do anything
she can to win.

00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:16.333
He's right about Jordan Baker.

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:19.800
That's why the marriage is
not going to take place.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.600
But more than that, it's not
even that she's not such a

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.600
great marriage companion.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:31.800
It is that Nick really doesn't
even care enough to be hurt by

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.800
that realization.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.167
He is insulated by the emotional
hardware that has

00:48:39.167 --> 00:48:44.633
been his family's business for
these two generations.

00:48:44.633 --> 00:48:48.633
And so that's why the family
history is so important to

00:48:48.633 --> 00:48:53.367
Nick and why he really needs
a substitute, because he is

00:48:53.367 --> 00:49:00.300
simply incapable of feeling
the ecstasy that Gatsby is

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.767
capable of feeling.

00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:06.467
Nor is he capable of feeling the
devastation that Gatsby is

00:49:06.467 --> 00:49:07.300
capable of feeling.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.100
Those two go hand in hand.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.167
You get ecstasy, you
get devastation.

00:49:12.167 --> 00:49:15.233
Nick is not capable of either.

00:49:15.233 --> 00:49:19.567
And that's why he's such good
friends with Gatsby and why

00:49:19.567 --> 00:49:22.067
he's always standing by Gatsby,
because he really

00:49:22.067 --> 00:49:28.967
needs that indirect experience
of what it feels to be in

00:49:28.967 --> 00:49:32.300
Gatsby's mind and to have that
ghostly heart with its

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:35.467
miraculous storage capacity.

00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:40.933
So anyway, this is Fitzgerald's
way of

00:49:40.933 --> 00:49:44.100
encouraging us to think about
different constellations,

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.300
different configurations,
different constellations of

00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.700
characters.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:52.267
And Nick and Gatsby are not the
most obvious couple, but

00:49:52.267 --> 00:49:54.867
it turns out that actually the
whole story of The Great

00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:59.533
Gatsby can be told by looking at
this nontraditional couple.

00:49:59.533 --> 00:50:02.300
And I would encourage you in
section to think of other

00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.233
nontraditional couples
as well.

00:50:04.233 --> 00:50:07.033
And we'll turn to Faulkner
next week.

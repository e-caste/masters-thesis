RONALD SMITH: We are starting a brand
new subject today.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.467
It's one though that is integral
with the course, and

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.867
that's the study
of the oceans.

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:13.733
As we'll see, not only the
atmosphere and the ocean

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:18.800
interact, each influences the
other which makes it necessary

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.900
to understand both.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.133
But also, to some extent, they
obey similar laws of physics.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:32.600
For example, questions of static
stability, when will a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.900
column of air turn over, when
will a column of water turn

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.633
over, what makes the winds blow,
what makes the ocean

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.367
currents move, Coriolis
plays--

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:47.067
Coriolis force plays a
similar role in both.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:50.900
So this would be a time not only
for you to learn a few

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.833
things about the ocean, but
to establish more linkages

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.167
between the things you've
learned before and the things

00:00:57.167 --> 00:00:58.167
you're learning now.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.533
Now that we're halfway, or
almost halfway through the

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.933
course, linkages are a big
part of the course.

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:08.233
Where you find connections
between things we've already

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.200
done, and things we're
learning now.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.467
So try to flag those whenever
you come across them, I think

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:17.767
it'll help you learn the
material more and it'll

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:21.167
establish a sense, I hope,
of unity in the course.

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.867
Where things begin to gel, and
become easier, because a very

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:28.467
limited set of physical
principles can apply to a wide

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:31.833
range of geophysical
phenomena.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:39.533
OK, so what we're going
to do today.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:43.233
I'll probably just do the first
two, we'll talk about

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.800
the bathymetry of the oceans.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.333
The word bathymetry here means
the study of the ocean depth.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:53.333
So it's pretty straightforward,
just how deep

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:53.967
is the ocean.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:56.267
That's the subject
of bathymetry.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.700
We're going to see, however,
that ties very closely to

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.733
plate tectonics.

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:03.667
Now if you were taking a course
in geology, which my

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.733
department offers a number
of, you would study plate

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.100
tectonics in quite
some detail.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.267
It's the modern paradigm to
understand how the continents

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.867
were formed, and the oceans are
formed, and a number of

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:18.700
the things you see in rocks.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.467
We're just going to touch on it
briefly, because this isn't

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.600
a course in geology, but I
need to do it because you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.533
can't understand the bathymetry
of the oceans

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.500
without understanding a bit
about plate tectonics.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.733
Has anybody had a course in
geology where they talked

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.800
about plate tectonics?

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.167
Sarah has--So you're going to
see that stuff coming back,

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:39.167
but fairly quickly.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.533
I'm not going to spend
too much time on it.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.233
We'll spend most of today
talking about temperature and

00:02:44.233 --> 00:02:47.833
salinity, and we might get into
ocean currents today, but

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:50.767
if not that'll be the subject
of next time.

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:54.100
And then biological productivity
will eventually,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.933
maybe Friday or next week,
get into El Nino.

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:02.167
Sarah reminded me that there's
no chapter in your book on

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:06.000
oceanography, so we're kind
of on our own here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.533
These notes will be posted, but
there is a section on El

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.200
Nino, and you're going to want
to read that, and that'll give

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.833
a little background information
about the oceans.

00:03:14.833 --> 00:03:16.967
And there may be a few little
other bits and pieces

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.900
scattered throughout the
textbook on oceanography.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.467
So take advantage of what you
have there, but realize there

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.500
isn't a great deal, and so
you'll have to rely fairly

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.933
heavily on the notes here.

00:03:30.533 --> 00:03:35.133
OK, so some of you have
seen this, probably

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.533
most of you seen this.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:41.433
The basic idea behind plate
tectonics is that the

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:48.500
spherical skin of the earth,
this shallow layer called the

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.367
crust that's rather rigid
floating above a deeper

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:58.733
semi-liquid mantle, that crust
is broken into several

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:02.200
discrete plates.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.800
The Indo-Australian plate, the
African plate, the South

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.667
American plate, and those
plates, as they move around

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:11.933
remain rigid.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:15.467
And so the interactions, or the
interesting parts, occur

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:19.533
at the boundaries where one
rigid plate butts up against

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.933
another and some kind of
interaction occurs.

00:04:22.933 --> 00:04:26.400
Maybe it's a subduction zone,
maybe it's a new--new plate

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.267
material being formed, but
that's the way we try to

00:04:30.267 --> 00:04:32.467
understand the structure of
the earth these days is to

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:37.267
understand where are these
plates, and how do their edges

00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:40.600
deform as the plates
move around.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.667
So for example, that boundary
there is a mid-ocean ridge, or

00:04:45.667 --> 00:04:49.000
a so called mid-ocean spreading
center, you can tell

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.833
that from the arrow.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:55.667
So new ocean crust is being
formed at that point, and so

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:59.300
this plate is moving away from
that plate at a certain rate.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.367
Up here in the North Atlantic as
well, you've got the plates

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:05.400
pulling away from each
other, and new ocean

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.600
crust is being formed.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.633
In a line like that look, this
artist has used kind of a cold

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:14.400
front symbol, I don't know where
he got that idea from.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.533
But the basic idea here is that
that symbol, for this

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:20.533
artist, is referring to a
subduction zone, where one

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:25.033
plate is being drawn
down under another.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:28.900
And so crustal material is being
disappeared, it's being

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.067
returned down into the
mantle of the earth.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:41.633
Notice that some plates are
consisting of ocean only, some

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.833
plates are consisting of a
combination of continental

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:55.300
crust and ocean crust. OK, so
that's the basic idea behind

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.567
plate tectonics.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:04.300
The plates are shown also in
this cartoon, and once again

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.933
note that for example, this
large Pacific plate, fairly

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:14.033
rigid and giant in size,
is ocean crust only.

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:17.300
Whereas most of the others, not
the Nazca plate, but the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.967
Australian plate, has ocean
crust plus continental crust.

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:26.600
The Eurasian plate has both,
North American plate has a big

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.167
chunk of ocean in it.

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:30.233
So when you think
about plates.

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:34.300
Remember the earlier, the thing
that preceded this, was

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.300
the theory of continental
drift.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.867
Continental drift was the idea
that people noticed this nice

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:46.300
jigsaw fit, for example, between
South America and the

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.100
bite of Africa.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.600
Or the way this coast kind of
could fit in against here.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.267
Or the fact that the rocks
here, were similar to the

00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.300
rocks there up in Scotland.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.833
So the idea was that, early on,
that the continents may

00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:01.400
have moved.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.833
But the early idea was that they
moved through the ocean,

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:10.233
the continents plowed their
way through ocean crust to

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:14.600
move around on our planet.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.300
However that was soon found to
be incorrect, because the

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.733
physics of trying to push a
continent through ocean crust

00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:25.333
was shown to be impossible.

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:29.400
Instead this is the vision that
now seems to be the right

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.567
one, where you've got plates
sometimes consisting of

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.633
continents and oceans.

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:38.967
They move relative to another,
relative to one another, and

00:07:38.967 --> 00:07:41.500
all the action is right at
their boundaries, where

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.733
there's creation of new crust
or the destruction of crust.

00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:49.533
So this is the conceptual model
that seems to fit all

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:54.667
the data that we have.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:59.000
And what would drive that kind
of motion, well it's basically

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.700
part of the mantle convection.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:04.400
So there's heat being generated
in the interior of

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.800
the earth, by the decay of
radioactive elements, like

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.067
uranium and so on, decays
naturally, releases heat.

00:08:12.067 --> 00:08:14.933
The interior of the earth
heats up, and that

00:08:14.933 --> 00:08:17.533
destabilizes the lapse
rate if you like.

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:20.733
It basically, if you're heating
this fluid from below,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:24.467
you're destabilizing it
and convection begins.

00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:28.733
And as part of that convection
cell, then you get spreading

00:08:28.733 --> 00:08:32.533
centers for the crust and then
subduction zones where some of

00:08:32.533 --> 00:08:36.133
that crustal material is drawn
back into the mantle, and

00:08:36.133 --> 00:08:37.900
melted, and returned.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:44.967
So it's not a crust only
phenomenon,, it's driven by

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.500
mantle convection, but for our
purposes we're interested

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.967
primarily in what it does to
the crust of the earth.

00:08:55.267 --> 00:08:58.533
So going back into
geologic time, we

00:08:58.533 --> 00:08:59.700
can see this happening.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:03.800
So here's the present day, and
then we go back in time to the

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:07.500
Cretaceous, the Jurassic, the
Triassic, and Permian.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.933
Here's a geologic time scale,
the age of the earth, this is

00:09:12.933 --> 00:09:18.100
in thousands--in millions of
years, the age of the earth is

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.400
back here around five, roughly
five billion years ago.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.667
And the first one of these
diagrams that the artist is

00:09:26.667 --> 00:09:30.533
showing is the Permian,
which is about 255

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:31.567
million years ago.

00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:34.900
At that point all the continents
were together, in a

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.200
giant super continent
called Pangaea.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:43.367
And then as time progressed it
split up, first with a seaway

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.000
that came through this way, and
then eventually you begin

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.700
to get the Atlantic ocean
opening up, and today you have

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:50.633
something like this.

00:09:50.633 --> 00:09:54.333
So we're going from 255 million
years ago for the

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:58.467
Permian, and then stepping
forward to the Triassic, the

00:09:58.467 --> 00:10:00.467
Jurassic, the Cretaceous.

00:10:00.467 --> 00:10:04.067
So when the dinosaurs
roamed the earth,

00:10:04.067 --> 00:10:06.733
it was in this stage.

00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:11.633
And when humans evolved,
well it was already

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:13.100
looking like this.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.800
So humans never saw this
configuration, humans evolved

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.333
just in the last couple
of million years.

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:25.333
So we've been looking at
that structure for our

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.567
evolutionary history.

00:10:29.833 --> 00:10:33.633
Now, so what does this mean
for the structure of the

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:34.833
oceans and the continents?

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:40.933
So here's a section through
let's take it through here I

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.567
guess an east-west, section.

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:46.900
I think it's in the southern
hemisphere, let's check that.

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:52.033
Yeah, so there's South America,
so this is an

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:59.667
east-west, section through
the South Atlantic ocean.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:03.467
It shows the Pacific Ocean
plate, which is continental

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:05.900
crust being subducted below the

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.000
mountains of South America.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.500
As that material is drawn down
into the mantle, it melts.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.733
As it melts, some lava, some
magma, has come off of that.

00:11:18.733 --> 00:11:21.800
That then make their way upwards
to cause the volcanoes

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.567
along the west coast
of South America.

00:11:25.567 --> 00:11:28.500
Otherwise the rest of that
material is just lost down

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.800
into the mantle.

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.533
When you get over into the
Atlantic Ocean, there's a

00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:37.100
rigid boundary there that's
part of the same plate.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.200
Continental crust, and ocean
crust, part of the same plate,

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.300
but there's a spreading
center.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.600
That's where molten material
is coming up again and

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.333
solidifying as it cools to form
new ocean crust. So this

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:53.933
is moving away, while new ocean
crust is being created

00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:55.433
right at that point.

00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:59.300
And then over here, that's a
rigid-rigid connection, so

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.800
that once again is part of the
same plate with no crust being

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.833
lost or gained at that
particular boundary.

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:10.100
But the point I want to make
here is that there are two

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.333
types of crust. Continental
crust is generally of a

00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:21.067
lighter material, and floats a
bit higher in the semi-molten

00:12:21.067 --> 00:12:24.067
parts of the mantle, whereas
the ocean crust is a little

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:29.367
bit denser and floats
a bit lower.

00:12:29.367 --> 00:12:36.300
So you've got basically a lower
floating ocean crust

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:42.267
here, and a less dense higher
floating continental crust.

00:12:42.267 --> 00:12:44.867
And then when you fill that
with water the water has

00:12:44.867 --> 00:12:47.467
nothing to do with this of
course, but the addition of

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:50.967
water makes it seem like
an ocean to us.

00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:54.733
There happens to be enough
water in the ocean to

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:59.433
generally cover the ocean crust,
but not to cover the

00:12:59.433 --> 00:13:00.200
continents.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.700
Now if there were twice as much
liquid water available on

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.367
the planet, that distinction
would be less important

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:10.067
because the water level would
be here, and it would cover

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:15.433
both the ocean crust and the
continental crust. But with

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:18.733
the amount of water that we
have, it means that the

00:13:18.733 --> 00:13:23.400
continental crust usually sticks
above sea level and the

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.367
ocean crust does not, it's
submerged below sea level.

00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:30.133
Remember that amount
of water is quite

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:31.633
unconnected with any of this.

00:13:31.633 --> 00:13:36.267
The amount of water we have on
the planet probably did come

00:13:36.267 --> 00:13:39.833
out of the interior of the
planet over geologic time, but

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:43.033
it's just an accident that it
happens to be deep enough to

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:46.900
cover the ocean crust but not
the continental crust. And

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:49.367
we'll find a few exceptions
to that when we look

00:13:49.367 --> 00:13:52.133
more closely as well.

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:55.000
Any questions on this?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.033
Yes.

00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:56.267
STUDENT: So what are the
differences between the ocean

00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:57.533
crust and continental crust
besides just their density?

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:02.700
PROFESSOR: Well, they're made of slightly

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.600
different chemical
compositions.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.700
Normally there's more, I think
quartz generally in these

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.267
rocks, a light mineral allows it
to be a little bit denser,

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:16.800
a little bit less dense.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.367
And other denser minerals are
found more prolifically in the

00:14:22.367 --> 00:14:26.133
ocean crust, which makes
it a little bit denser.

00:14:29.133 --> 00:14:32.000
OK, we'll come back to that.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.300
But I wanted to make this point,
so when you then take

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:42.167
a, what's called, make a
hypsometric curve, I'm going

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:45.533
to focus on the bar graph
over here on the left.

00:14:45.533 --> 00:14:50.133
This is elevation in meters
above and below sea level, sea

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:52.167
level is marked at zero here.

00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:56.167
Which I remind you is a somewhat
arbitrary choice, it

00:14:56.167 --> 00:14:59.800
depends on how much water
we have in the oceans.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.733
And over geologic time,
that has probably

00:15:02.733 --> 00:15:03.433
changed a little bit.

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:06.800
For example, when you have an
ice age you store some of the

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.467
water up on the continents in
the form of glaciers, and sea

00:15:10.467 --> 00:15:11.800
level drops a little bit.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.900
So that is kind of an arbitrary
reference point, but

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.533
it's commonly used and
so we'll use it here.

00:15:17.533 --> 00:15:20.267
Whats shown in the bar graph
then, is the percent of the

00:15:20.267 --> 00:15:24.367
earth's surface that lies, for
example, between sea level and

00:15:24.367 --> 00:15:26.033
one kilometer above.

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:29.400
And it's about 20% of
the earth's surface.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.467
Between one kilometer and two
kilometers above sea level,

00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:35.333
it's about 5% of the
earth's surface.

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:38.067
And you find some parts on the
continents that are even

00:15:38.067 --> 00:15:42.133
higher, even up to four, but you
know in fact Mount Everest

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:44.967
is up here somewhere, there's
even a little bit of land that

00:15:44.967 --> 00:15:49.667
lies 9000 meters above
sea level.

00:15:49.667 --> 00:15:54.067
Going down below sea level, you
find there's not much land

00:15:54.067 --> 00:15:56.067
at one kilometer, two
kilometers, and three

00:15:56.067 --> 00:15:57.733
kilometers below sea level.

00:15:57.733 --> 00:16:01.533
But a lot at four,
five, and six

00:16:01.533 --> 00:16:03.433
kilometers below sea level.

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:06.033
Now this is a bit of a surprise
because if the earth

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:11.200
was just a rough surface, had
been roughened by some

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:17.500
process, it would have kind of a
normal distribution for this

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.667
hypsometric curve.

00:16:18.667 --> 00:16:21.533
It would have some average
height, and then less above,

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:22.233
and less below.

00:16:22.233 --> 00:16:26.933
But actually no, this has
a double peak, a very

00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:28.967
interesting double peak.

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.533
And of course that has to do
with the point I already made.

00:16:31.533 --> 00:16:35.800
There are two types of crust
here, this is continental

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:41.000
crust and this is ocean crust.
So this plate tectonics that

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.100
gives us the two types of
crust, ocean crust and

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.733
continental crust, is the cause
for this double peak in

00:16:48.733 --> 00:16:53.433
the hypsometric curve
for land elevation.

00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:56.267
And again it just so happens
that we have an amount of

00:16:56.267 --> 00:17:01.267
water that puts most of this
down below sea level, and some

00:17:01.267 --> 00:17:05.300
or most of the continents
just at sea

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:07.967
level or slightly above.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:18.267
So now we can turn to the
particular features,

00:17:18.267 --> 00:17:20.600
bathymetric features
in the ocean.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.433
I'm going to talk about the
abyssal plane, which are these

00:17:24.433 --> 00:17:29.267
flat lying parts of
the ocean bottom.

00:17:29.267 --> 00:17:32.567
And then some of these other
things that have to do with

00:17:32.567 --> 00:17:34.500
plate tectonics like the
mid-ocean ridges, the

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.333
trenches, and then some other
features as well.

00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:43.433
The way we know all of this
by the way is from

00:17:43.433 --> 00:17:44.800
acoustic depth profiling.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.500
So you take a ship, and it sends
out an acoustic signal,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.133
a sound wave, and you bounce it
off the bottom and you time

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:55.900
how long it takes that signal
to go down to the bottom of

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.100
the ocean and back up again.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.367
And in the old days you just
had a single pinger going

00:18:01.367 --> 00:18:05.000
right directly down, so you'd
have to take the ship back and

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.967
forth on a very complicated
long route

00:18:07.967 --> 00:18:08.900
to map out the ocean.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.033
But now, they can send it out
in a fan with different

00:18:12.033 --> 00:18:14.133
acoustic beams going in
different directions, so you

00:18:14.133 --> 00:18:18.333
can do a single swath as you
go along and get depth over

00:18:18.333 --> 00:18:21.867
some range to your left
and to your right as

00:18:21.867 --> 00:18:24.333
the ship sails along.

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:28.400
Also in some cases, but I won't
be emphasizing it here,

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.400
you can look for other
reflections

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.833
off subsurface layers.

00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:36.900
For example, that sound wave
may go down into the ocean

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.133
crust or the sediments a little
bit, and bounce back

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:42.700
up, giving you ideas of what's
going on below the

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.200
bottom of the ocean.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.600
And that'd be useful if you're
doing geological surveys of

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.533
the ocean crust. But for our
purposes we're just going to

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:58.067
be using that to map out the
actual ocean depth itself.

00:18:58.067 --> 00:18:59.567
Stop me if you have
questions here.

00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:06.567
Sound moves rapidly in seawater,
the speed of sound

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:09.800
in air is about 300 meters per
second, speed of sound in

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.667
water I think is three or four
times that, it's really--it

00:19:12.667 --> 00:19:13.933
goes quite rapidly.

00:19:13.933 --> 00:19:16.933
Nonetheless it's still a finite
speed, and you can

00:19:16.933 --> 00:19:21.000
easily time how long it takes
for that acoustic signal to

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
get back to your receiver and
get the depth from that.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.700
So this is a cartoon just
showing some of the features.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.967
For example, there's a section
of abyssal plane, that kind of

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:39.100
flat lying section.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.667
Flat in part, because it's
composed of sediments that

00:19:41.667 --> 00:19:46.233
have fallen from above, and as
they fall they fill in the

00:19:46.233 --> 00:19:49.733
cracks first, and then as you
get quite a pile of sediments

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:52.867
it tends to give you
a flat surface.

00:19:52.867 --> 00:19:56.633
A mid-ocean ridge, one of these
spreading centers where

00:19:56.633 --> 00:20:00.567
magmas are coming up and forming
new ocean crust, tends

00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:04.433
to be elevated because those
rocks are still hot, and less

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:09.867
dense, and they float a bit
higher than cold ocean crust

00:20:09.867 --> 00:20:11.667
until they cool down.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:14.167
And then they sink a little
bit away from

00:20:14.167 --> 00:20:16.133
the spreading center.

00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:18.967
But that could come up a bit,
if this abyssal plane is at

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:22.700
five kilometers, then this
mid-ocean ridge might only be

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.633
two or three kilometers below
the ocean surface.

00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:34.433
You can have undersea volcanoes,
that'll start

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:37.933
building from the ocean floor,
just like volcanoes on land

00:20:37.933 --> 00:20:40.367
start to build from
the continental

00:20:40.367 --> 00:20:43.033
surface and build upwards.

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.900
Undersea volcanoes build up from
the ocean floor, and in

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:52.867
some cases they will not reach
the ocean surface, in which

00:20:52.867 --> 00:20:55.333
case they're called seamounts.

00:20:55.333 --> 00:20:57.933
I don't know why they've drawn
this the way they have,

00:20:57.933 --> 00:21:01.100
indicating that these have
penetrated the earth's

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:02.333
surface, the ocean surface.

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:06.700
Usually the word seamount is
confined to an undersea

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.833
volcano that has not reached
the earth's surface, so I

00:21:09.833 --> 00:21:12.300
disagree with the artist
a little bit here.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:17.700
On occasion you find them with
flat tops, which means that at

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:22.600
one point they reached the ocean
surface and were leveled

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.700
by wave action.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.100
And now they've settled back
down a little bit, so you'll

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.300
find undersea volcanoes some of
them with a flat surface,

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.433
those are called guyots.

00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:37.100
And then the ocean trenches,
where you get the subducting

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:43.967
plates, are the deepest parts
of the ocean generally.

00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:45.900
Then I wanted to make
this point about

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.367
a continental shelf.

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:51.033
So there's a continent, there's
a continental shelf,

00:21:51.033 --> 00:21:54.233
there's the drop down to
the abyssal plane.

00:21:54.233 --> 00:22:00.300
You see then geologically, a
continental shelf is really

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.000
part of the continent.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.567
It just so happens that the
water level is high enough so

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:11.633
it's covered up slightly some of
this, making it appear on a

00:22:11.633 --> 00:22:15.633
map of the earth that its ocean,
but geologically it is

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:18.267
continental.

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:20.667
And there should be very little
confusion about the

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:23.767
two, because this is going to
be a very shallow ocean,

00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:27.833
probably only 100 or
200 meters deep.

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:31.533
Whereas this is five kilometers
deep, so it's going

00:22:31.533 --> 00:22:37.667
to be pretty clear to separate
geologic continental

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:40.933
structures from geologic ocean
crustal structures.

00:22:40.933 --> 00:22:43.300
Because they really are at a
very different level, even

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.400
though there's enough water at
the present time, especially

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.733
with the glaciers mostly melted
at this time to make a

00:22:51.733 --> 00:22:55.533
little thin layer of
water covering

00:22:55.533 --> 00:22:56.800
those continental shelves.

00:23:01.167 --> 00:23:06.133
So now here's the whole, the
whole world ocean, and the

00:23:06.133 --> 00:23:08.633
color scheme is not quantified
on here, but I can tell you

00:23:08.633 --> 00:23:10.067
basically what's going on.

00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:14.667
All the deep blue is abyssal
plane, about

00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:16.533
five kilometers deep.

00:23:16.533 --> 00:23:21.800
And you see it a
lot of places.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.200
These little lines that run up
through the middle of oceans,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.267
for example in the South Pacific
and all the way up

00:23:29.267 --> 00:23:31.733
through the Atlantic, the south
and the north Atlantic,

00:23:31.733 --> 00:23:36.300
those are spreading centers,
mid-ocean ridges.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.867
And then the trenches don't show
up well on this diagram,

00:23:40.867 --> 00:23:43.867
but they are the darker
blue still.

00:23:43.867 --> 00:23:47.667
And you see a little thin line
along there that's a trench,

00:23:47.667 --> 00:23:51.267
you see one here, you see an
important one here, and up

00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:55.233
along here, and even along the
tip of Aleutian Islands.

00:23:55.233 --> 00:23:58.933
So those are the subduction
zones.

00:23:58.933 --> 00:24:03.033
You also see a scattering of sea
mounts various places, and

00:24:03.033 --> 00:24:04.133
other features.

00:24:04.133 --> 00:24:07.867
But I'd say oh and you see the,
for example, right along

00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:13.133
there, you see a nice example
of continental material with

00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:16.133
just enough water over it so we
would call that ocean, but

00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:19.200
geologically it is continent.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.167
That's the continental shelves,

00:24:22.167 --> 00:24:24.533
continental shelf area.

00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:28.033
So this is the geometry in which
then we'll be studying

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:29.333
ocean currents and so on.

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:36.533
It's going to be constrained by
this pattern of depth, and

00:24:36.533 --> 00:24:39.100
the thing that's going to be
very important to us is the

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.300
way that these continents
tend to break up

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.867
the oceans into segments.

00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:50.667
For example, Asia with Australia
included, and North

00:24:50.667 --> 00:24:53.933
and South America, break up the
Pacific ocean into kind of

00:24:53.933 --> 00:24:55.833
a north, south, oriented
ocean.

00:24:58.733 --> 00:25:02.567
North America, South America,
compared with Europe and

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:04.800
Africa, break up the Atlantic
again into a north, south,

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.733
oriented ocean.

00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:09.367
The Indian Ocean is a little
bit different because Asia

00:25:09.367 --> 00:25:12.800
fills the northern hemisphere,
most of it, down to about say

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.900
20 degrees north latitude.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.933
So the Indian Ocean is primarily
an ocean just in the

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:20.033
southern hemisphere.

00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:23.867
And then, the one gigantic
exception to this is the

00:25:23.867 --> 00:25:26.867
so-called Southern Ocean.

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:29.300
The term for that strip of ocean
that goes all the way

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.733
around the globe, it's usually
called the Southern Ocean in

00:25:33.733 --> 00:25:36.000
oceanography.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.800
And if you go far enough south
in the Pacific you join onto

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:42.600
it, the Atlantic you join onto
it, the Indian you join on.

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.667
And as we'll see, you can have
ocean currents here that go

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:47.567
right around the globe.

00:25:47.567 --> 00:25:51.133
Whereas at all these higher
latitudes, any ocean current

00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:54.333
that moves east-west is going
to hit a continent and is

00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:56.767
going to have to wrap
back around.

00:25:56.767 --> 00:26:01.333
So you get what are called
gyres, in most of the oceans,

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:03.967
because they're confined
by these

00:26:03.967 --> 00:26:07.333
north-south oriented barriers.

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:11.033
So gyres are the things we'll
be studying for most of the

00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:13.567
oceans, but not in the
southern ocean.

00:26:13.567 --> 00:26:15.533
There we'll be able to look at
a current that goes all the

00:26:15.533 --> 00:26:19.433
way, all the way around
the globe.

00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:20.700
Questions on this?

00:26:23.433 --> 00:26:28.433
So we'll zoom in a little bit
to--so all the major oceans,

00:26:28.433 --> 00:26:29.700
there's the Atlantic ocean.

00:26:32.733 --> 00:26:37.400
A little bit of a trench here,
but generally it's abyssal

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.967
plane, and it is with
a mid-ocean

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:41.433
spreading center here.

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:45.300
By the way, so that's spreading
which now these

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.933
continents were originally
joined together, and you can

00:26:47.933 --> 00:26:52.100
see how well they fit from a
jigsaw puzzle point of view.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:58.200
That spreading is at about the
rate the way I remember this

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:02.567
it's at about the rate that your
fingernails grow, so it's

00:27:02.567 --> 00:27:06.200
a couple of centimeters
per year basically.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.100
So this is still widening today,
and at the end of the

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.533
year it's going to be
a few centimeters--

00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:15.467
the Atlantic ocean is going to
be a few centimeters wider

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:18.267
than it is today.

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:22.067
And that's a slow process, but
when you take that speed and

00:27:22.067 --> 00:27:25.500
multiply it over millions of
years, you can see how you can

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.800
get hundreds or even thousands
of kilometers of ocean width

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:34.867
generated by that
slow spreading.

00:27:34.867 --> 00:27:39.667
And then once again, you see
some continental shelf area up

00:27:39.667 --> 00:27:41.867
in here, covered by water, but

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:45.700
generally part of the continent.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:49.933
And you see a big piece of that
down here as well, around

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:52.067
Africa a little bit too.

00:27:52.067 --> 00:27:55.933
And all of the Mediterranean
sea, most of it is you'd

00:27:55.933 --> 00:27:58.533
probably call it
ocean--continental crust

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:01.733
rather than ocean crust.

00:28:01.733 --> 00:28:06.333
Pacific ocean, vast areas of
abyssal plane, but there are

00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:12.000
trench systems hard to see,
but the black lines.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.500
Mid-ocean ridge that comes down
here, was spreading, and

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.467
then lots of ocean crust here.

00:28:18.467 --> 00:28:21.533
And then up along California,
you're having some motions.

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:25.033
It's more of a transform fault,
where things are moving

00:28:25.033 --> 00:28:28.767
parallel to one another, not
exactly a spreading center,

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:32.967
not exactly subduction, but some
complicated combination

00:28:32.967 --> 00:28:35.567
of the two including
lateral slip.

00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:41.167
And so we'll see, once again,
we'll get gyres in the

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:46.233
Northern and Southern Pacific
constrained by the barrier

00:28:46.233 --> 00:28:50.433
affect of the continents
to the east and west.

00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:55.667
Indian Ocean bathymetry, big
continental a big abyssal

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:59.600
planes, and then some curious
old, these appear to be old

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.167
spreading centers that
are no longer active.

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:05.133
Maybe Erin can tell us
more about that.

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:07.433
But anyway there's some
structures there, but they

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:10.033
don't appear to be active
spreading centers.

00:29:10.033 --> 00:29:12.533
And here's some of the
subduction zones over in the

00:29:12.533 --> 00:29:13.800
Pacific there.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.233
The Arctic Ocean has some
interesting structure, but

00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:19.433
it's pretty passive too.

00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:26.433
There's two deep basins--most of
this is continental shelf,

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:35.000
pretty shallow, depth the order
of a few hundred meters.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.633
But there are a couple of deep
parts as well, that go down to

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:41.033
several kilometers.

00:29:41.033 --> 00:29:45.733
And then a ridge, I think a
passive one, that's called the

00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:48.800
Lomonosov Ridge, but I don't
think that's an active

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.500
spreading center.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.500
So this has got some interesting
structure, but

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:55.200
it's more of a passive structure
at the moment, it's

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.200
not an active spreading
center.

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:05.100
OK, so that's an introduction
to the shape

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.333
of the ocean basins.

00:30:06.333 --> 00:30:07.500
Are there any questions
on that?

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:16.333
I want to turn now to ocean
properties, ocean water

00:30:16.333 --> 00:30:17.367
properties.

00:30:17.367 --> 00:30:22.100
Sea surface temperature, that
we measure from ships, from

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.167
instruments below the ships,
and from satellites.

00:30:26.733 --> 00:30:30.800
We can measure salinity from
ships, to get into the deep

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.333
ocean we need to put something
down into the ocean, I'll show

00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:35.567
you how we do that.

00:30:35.567 --> 00:30:39.867
For ocean topography, which I'll
define later, a little

00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:43.067
irregularity in the ocean
surface, we use

00:30:43.067 --> 00:30:44.267
satellites for that.

00:30:44.267 --> 00:30:47.600
And then for ocean currents we
use all those things ships,

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.900
floats, and moorings.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.367
So before we're done, I'm going
to talk about how we

00:30:51.367 --> 00:30:55.100
measure all these things, and
understand a bit about the

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.467
ocean water and how
it's moving.

00:30:58.467 --> 00:31:06.733
So here is a map taken in late
August, I think of the year

00:31:06.733 --> 00:31:11.200
2000 from satellites, showing
the sea surface temperature,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:17.033
SST. The color is in Celsius,
and you see that in the

00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:20.300
tropical regions you're getting
up to temperatures 28

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:20.567
and higher.

00:31:20.567 --> 00:31:25.800
Remember 27, 28, was the
threshold for hurricanes.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.367
So you are getting a lot of warm
ocean temperature that

00:31:29.367 --> 00:31:31.967
support hurricanes, some of that
however is right at the

00:31:31.967 --> 00:31:35.633
equator and so you couldn't have
hurricanes forming there

00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:37.633
because you don't have
the Coriolis force.

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:40.900
But in other parts you get the
warm water extending far

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.033
enough away from the equator, so
you could have hurricanes.

00:31:44.033 --> 00:31:46.000
I pointed out when we were
talking about hurricanes, two

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.100
interesting places.

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:55.467
The Western tropical South
Pacific, where you don't have

00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:58.167
hurricanes because it's too
cold, and you see it there.

00:31:58.167 --> 00:32:00.733
It's a cold ocean current, the
Humboldt Current coming up

00:32:00.733 --> 00:32:06.700
here, taking cold water from
the Southern Ocean, peeling

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.867
some of it off, bring it up
here, and keeping that part of

00:32:09.867 --> 00:32:12.533
the world ocean cool.

00:32:12.533 --> 00:32:16.767
And you see something very
similar here, where cold

00:32:16.767 --> 00:32:18.833
waters being peeled off and
come up here to keep the

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:22.867
southern tropical Atlantic
a bit cool as well.

00:32:22.867 --> 00:32:27.700
Otherwise it's pretty warm in
the tropics, except where

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.033
you're getting these
cool currents.

00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:32.233
The California current does a
little bit of cooling in this

00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:35.000
region, and the return from
the Gulfstream does some

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.267
cooling on the eastern side of
the north Atlantic there, so

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:42.100
that's that now.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:45.600
But if you get a mental picture
of this, be very

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.633
careful what you do with
it, because you could

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:49.833
be very much misled.

00:32:49.833 --> 00:32:54.933
This is sea surface temperature,
when I go down

00:32:54.933 --> 00:32:58.500
even just one kilometer in the
ocean, or especially if I go

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.467
down to the ocean
bottom, it looks

00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:02.933
nothing at all like this.

00:33:02.933 --> 00:33:05.100
So temperature is not vertically
homogeneous.

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:11.467
As I'll show you later on, this
warm water that can form

00:33:11.467 --> 00:33:16.600
near the tropics, forms a rather
thin layer floating on

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.100
the cold water that fills
most of the world ocean.

00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:27.933
So this is not a picture that
can then be transferred down

00:33:27.933 --> 00:33:31.000
into the ocean very
deep at all.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.967
In fact in some cases, you may
only be able to go down a few

00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:38.133
hundred meters before this
picture changes rather

00:33:38.133 --> 00:33:39.367
dramatically.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.333
Salinity is the other important
property we track in

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:50.000
ocean water, and here's a map
of the sea surface salinity.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.600
So just the surface, just the
salinity you would measure

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:56.267
from a ship if you took a
surface sample of water and

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:58.400
analyzed it.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:06.267
And well, the most remarkable
thing is the narrow range.

00:34:06.267 --> 00:34:11.333
And you get some salinities as
fresh as maybe 31 or 32 parts

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:13.600
per thousand.

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.800
And some, perhaps in the
Mediterranean Sea, and the Red

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.367
Sea, Gulf of Aden perhaps,
getting up to 38, 39.

00:34:23.367 --> 00:34:27.933
But generally that's the full
range of ocean salinity.

00:34:27.933 --> 00:34:31.333
So you've heard me say,
occasionally, that sea surface

00:34:31.333 --> 00:34:34.967
salinity is 35 parts per
thousand, of course that's not

00:34:34.967 --> 00:34:38.333
a very precise statement.

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:43.167
But it only goes about plus or
minus four parts per thousand

00:34:43.167 --> 00:34:47.167
around that mean value of
35 parts per thousand.

00:34:47.167 --> 00:34:53.233
The reason for this must be that
the ocean mixes itself

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:57.600
occasionally, to maintain
this kind of

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:02.367
rather homogeneous salinity.

00:35:02.367 --> 00:35:04.733
At least compared to the rate
at which you're adding

00:35:04.733 --> 00:35:07.533
freshwater, or the rate at
which you're adding or

00:35:07.533 --> 00:35:08.767
subtracting salt.

00:35:08.767 --> 00:35:13.467
So the basic story behind this
narrow range of salinity, is

00:35:13.467 --> 00:35:16.167
that the ocean is, at
least for salt,

00:35:16.167 --> 00:35:19.900
relatively well mixed.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:22.633
Now if it were completely well
mixed, it would have the same

00:35:22.633 --> 00:35:24.033
salinity everywhere.

00:35:24.033 --> 00:35:27.900
If it were vigorously being
stirred, like a vigorous spoon

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.000
stirring in a pot, any
differences would be

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:31.833
immediately removed.

00:35:31.833 --> 00:35:36.067
So it's not perfectly well
stirred, but is reasonably

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:40.233
well stirred, giving you this
rather homogeneous salinity

00:35:40.233 --> 00:35:43.133
over the world ocean.

00:35:43.133 --> 00:35:47.133
So that's lesson number one, but
at the next level though

00:35:47.133 --> 00:35:51.733
of detail, we can notice that
there are some variations.

00:35:51.733 --> 00:35:54.033
And they probably make sense
to us because it's in

00:35:54.033 --> 00:36:03.200
these--it's in the so called
Intertropical Convergence

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.833
Zone, or the belt of tropical
rainforests, that you get a

00:36:07.833 --> 00:36:09.633
little bit lower salinity.

00:36:09.633 --> 00:36:12.767
That's right through here, and
you see it here, and a little

00:36:12.767 --> 00:36:14.133
bit down through here.

00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:17.600
So there's a lot of rain falling
on the ocean there,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.333
fresh water coming down and
diluting the salt a little

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:26.433
bit, giving you a smaller
salinity along the equator.

00:36:26.433 --> 00:36:30.033
And then as you move north and
south from that into the belt

00:36:30.033 --> 00:36:34.167
of deserts, the descending
branch of the Hadley cell,

00:36:34.167 --> 00:36:37.433
with very little precipitation
and some evaporation.

00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:40.200
Remember when you evaporate
seawater, you leave the salt

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.500
behind, and so the salinity
is going to be increased.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.433
And you see the increased
salinity there in both the

00:36:47.433 --> 00:36:49.967
Northern and Southern
hemisphere, connected with the

00:36:49.967 --> 00:36:50.900
belt of deserts.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.533
And then you get up in the
mid-latitudes and once again

00:36:53.533 --> 00:36:56.767
you've got the frontal storms,
cold fronts, warm fronts,

00:36:56.767 --> 00:36:58.967
bringing rain and
that once again

00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:01.800
dilutes the surface salinity.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.300
So a lot of things we've spoken
about before, in terms

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.833
of the general circulation of
the atmosphere and where it

00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:13.867
rains and where it doesn't, are
reflected in this plot of

00:37:13.867 --> 00:37:17.367
sea surface salinity.

00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:21.433
Here again it'd be dangerous
though, to try to imagine that

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:24.400
pattern would extend down
to the oceans very far.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.233
Other things will take place
that will prevent this from

00:37:27.233 --> 00:37:32.600
being the pattern deeper
down in the ocean.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.833
Questions on that?

00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:41.333
OK, now I want to tell you
about how we get how we

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:46.900
measure ocean properties
down into the ocean.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.700
The old way to do this, and I'll
talk about the new ways

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:54.667
too, the old way for about 50
years, the predominant way for

00:37:54.667 --> 00:37:57.567
sounding the ocean, for getting
temperature and

00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:01.833
salinity profiles with depth,
was the Nansen bottle.

00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:05.267
And here's a diagram, here's a
picture of one, mounted on a

00:38:05.267 --> 00:38:09.200
cable that's about to be put
down into the ocean.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.867
And here is a cartoon of what
happens after it's put down

00:38:13.867 --> 00:38:16.400
into the ocean and is triggered,
so that it tips

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.667
over and the valves
close on it.

00:38:18.667 --> 00:38:22.933
Now I have one of those with
me, and I want to show how

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:27.467
this thing works because it's
kind of a clever gadget.

00:38:27.467 --> 00:38:30.633
And although it's not being
used much anymore, much of

00:38:30.633 --> 00:38:33.700
what we know about the
world ocean came

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.633
from this simple device.

00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:37.800
Again it's called a Nansen
bottle, it was designed by the

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:42.367
famous Norwegian explorer
Fridtjof Nansen.

00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:48.400
And it is composed of a hollow
metal tube, fairly thin and

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.833
its steel, with a valve at the
top and the bottom, that is

00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:57.433
currently If I look through this
it's open, I've got both

00:38:57.433 --> 00:39:00.300
valves open.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:05.033
And there is a tie rod that
connects the two valves, and

00:39:05.033 --> 00:39:09.733
so when this tie rod shifts
relative to the bottle itself,

00:39:09.733 --> 00:39:13.467
it'll close both valves
simultaneously.

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:17.667
So there's also a couple of
housings for thermometers on

00:39:17.667 --> 00:39:20.633
the outside, so you can get the
temperature of the water

00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:22.233
at that depth as well.

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:27.200
So imagine that you've come
you've taken your ship to a

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:37.933
given location, and you've got
a long cable coming up to a

00:39:37.933 --> 00:39:43.967
winch and a pulley, that then
takes that cable overboard and

00:39:43.967 --> 00:39:48.000
down to whatever depths
you want to go to.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.567
So how do we get started
with that?

00:39:49.567 --> 00:39:52.767
Well the winch operator gets
some of the cable in the

00:39:52.767 --> 00:39:57.967
water, and then the scientist
would lean over and attach the

00:39:57.967 --> 00:40:00.933
first one of these Nansen
bottles to this cable.

00:40:00.933 --> 00:40:03.733
So imagine you've got a cable
coming down like this, and

00:40:03.733 --> 00:40:07.167
you're leaning over the side of
the ship, and you reach out

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:10.033
and you fasten this thing in
by putting the cable right

00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:13.267
down in there and pushing
that little pin over.

00:40:13.267 --> 00:40:15.833
And then down here the cable
comes through there, and you

00:40:15.833 --> 00:40:18.100
lock it with a turn buckle.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:21.667
So it's locked securely
at the bottom, not so

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:24.733
securely at the top.

00:40:24.733 --> 00:40:28.133
Once you get it on there, you
wave to the winch operator,

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:30.233
and he puts that cable down.

00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:34.600
And you'd repeat that about 20
times over the next hour or

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:39.000
two, and when you're all done
you've got a cable overboard,

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.967
perhaps going down to
five kilometers.

00:40:40.967 --> 00:40:43.600
You can do this all the way down
to the abyssal plane, and

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.167
along this cable you have Nansen
bottles, perhaps as

00:40:47.167 --> 00:40:52.633
many as 20 of them.

00:40:52.633 --> 00:40:56.067
When that's all in place, then
you reach over one more time

00:40:56.067 --> 00:40:58.967
and you fasten a little thing
called a messenger, a little

00:40:58.967 --> 00:41:05.200
brass cylinder that slides
down the cable, hits this

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:12.033
little plate, knocking free this
pin, and now the weight

00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:15.267
of the bottle begins to act.

00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:24.333
Let's see if I can do this now,
OK I'm having trouble

00:41:24.333 --> 00:41:25.400
doing it with my bum arm here.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:32.200
But I'm pushing this thing down,
and as I do so it is has

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:38.133
fallen away to an orientation
like this, and now both valves

00:41:38.133 --> 00:41:43.467
are closed, trapping water
from that level.

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:45.967
So when it's brought up, you've
got samples of the

00:41:45.967 --> 00:41:47.133
water at each of these depths.

00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:50.133
Also, when you flip over these
thermometers, they're so

00:41:50.133 --> 00:41:53.000
called reversing thermometers,
and when they're flipped over

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.533
the mercury column breaks, and
so you lock in the temperature

00:41:57.533 --> 00:41:59.300
at that depth.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.800
And when you bring it up, you've
got a record of what

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.100
the temperature was
at that depth.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.000
So by flipping it over, you lock
in the temperature, and

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.600
by flipping it over and closing
the valves, you lock

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.367
in the sample of water
from that depth.

00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:15.633
Then over the next couple of
hours you bring that cable

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:19.267
back to the surface, and each
time when a Nansen bottle

00:42:19.267 --> 00:42:21.733
emerges, you reach over,
disconnect it,

00:42:21.733 --> 00:42:22.967
and put it in a rack.

00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.767
And after several hours of work,
you've got data from the

00:42:25.767 --> 00:42:26.767
whole sounding.

00:42:26.767 --> 00:42:29.967
And over a period of 50 years
or so throughout the 40's,

00:42:29.967 --> 00:42:34.600
50's, 60's, 70's, and 80's, this
was used to map out most

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.000
of the world ocean in terms
of its temperature

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.467
and salinity structure.

00:42:39.467 --> 00:42:42.533
Questions on that?

00:42:42.533 --> 00:42:45.733
You can pass that around if you
like, so people can get a

00:42:45.733 --> 00:42:47.067
sense for it.

00:42:47.067 --> 00:42:50.667
Now my first oceanographic
cruise I managed to embarrass

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:59.533
myself, by failing to get that
Nansen bottle properly secured

00:42:59.533 --> 00:43:01.533
before I waved to the
winch operator to

00:43:01.533 --> 00:43:02.333
tell him to go down.

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:06.100
So the very first one of these
I did, one of the Nansen

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:12.067
bottles came up totally
destroyed, crushed.

00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:15.767
And can you figure out how
that would have happened?

00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:20.700
So what happened is, it wasn't
secured properly at the top.

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:24.933
It had flipped, I didn't notice
I turned my back away,

00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:28.333
but it flipped before it
entered the water.

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:33.533
So both valves had closed with
air inside, and then it went

00:43:33.533 --> 00:43:34.233
down to depth.

00:43:34.233 --> 00:43:37.067
And of course, the pressure is
enormous at the bottom of the

00:43:37.067 --> 00:43:39.700
ocean, you can do a quick
hydrostatic calculation to

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:41.933
understand you can get hundreds
of atmospheres of

00:43:41.933 --> 00:43:43.133
pressure down there.

00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:45.533
And it just took that bottle
with air inside, and just

00:43:45.533 --> 00:43:49.700
crushed it like a Coke can in
your fist. And it came up all

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.567
wrinkled, and my chief scientist
was not very happy

00:43:52.567 --> 00:43:57.567
with me but I learned to do
better the next time.

00:43:57.567 --> 00:44:01.733
Anyway it's important
historical, but also to

00:44:01.733 --> 00:44:04.467
understand how that was done.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:13.300
Today it's done a bit
differently, it's done with a

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.967
CTD and a rosette.

00:44:14.967 --> 00:44:18.633
Now CTD is an abbreviation
meaning conductivity

00:44:18.633 --> 00:44:20.233
temperature depth.

00:44:20.233 --> 00:44:25.433
It's an electronic device, the
conductivity part is similar

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:29.333
to what we did on
the river lab.

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:32.700
As you lower this thing down
into the ocean, it measures

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.933
the electrical conductivity
and from that you can

00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:38.700
determine the salinity.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:41.033
It also has a thermistor on
there, so you can measure

00:44:41.033 --> 00:44:44.167
temperature, and it's got a
pressure sensor on there so

00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:45.267
you can measure depth.

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:48.533
So as you lower this down, in
real time because there's a

00:44:48.533 --> 00:44:51.633
cable coming back to the
surface, you're getting a

00:44:51.633 --> 00:44:54.333
detailed profile
of temperature,

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:56.867
salinity, and depth.

00:44:56.867 --> 00:44:59.267
That's a great system.

00:44:59.267 --> 00:45:04.000
However that of course would not
give you a water sample,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.800
so if you want to do any kind of
water chemistry a CTD would

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.167
not be sufficient.

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:14.133
The beauty of the old Nansen
bottle was, you got a water

00:45:14.133 --> 00:45:15.033
sample as well.

00:45:15.033 --> 00:45:17.133
So if you later on decide you
want to do any kind of

00:45:17.133 --> 00:45:19.600
chemistry, you had that
water sample.

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:23.067
The CTD is a great advance on
that, but it doesn't give you

00:45:23.067 --> 00:45:23.967
the water sample.

00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:27.000
So what's usually done today,
is that they have a set of

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.633
water collecting bottles
arranged around the perimeter,

00:45:31.633 --> 00:45:34.467
and that's called the rosette.

00:45:34.467 --> 00:45:38.067
And they've got an electronic
control, where the valves on

00:45:38.067 --> 00:45:42.067
these can be closed
on command.

00:45:42.067 --> 00:45:44.233
So in addition so you send this
down to the bottom the

00:45:44.233 --> 00:45:47.333
ocean, profiling conductivity,
temperature, depth.

00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:52.633
And then every, I don't know,
500 meters or so, you might

00:45:52.633 --> 00:45:56.533
close one of the valves on these
bottles and you get a

00:45:56.533 --> 00:45:58.533
water sample from that
depth as well.

00:45:58.533 --> 00:46:01.433
So if you were to go out on an
oceanographic cruise today,

00:46:01.433 --> 00:46:05.733
you'd be largely using the CTD
and the rosette to do vertical

00:46:05.733 --> 00:46:10.967
profiling of temperature
and salinity.

00:46:10.967 --> 00:46:12.200
Questions on that?

00:46:15.833 --> 00:46:19.133
So there's one, they brought it
back on board and they're,

00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:22.100
I guess, drawing samples off
of the, from the different

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.333
water bottles there.

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:29.500
Now technology is advancing
even beyond that, however.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:32.600
Remember even with that one, you
have to get a ship there,

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.533
you've got to get a cable over
that can go all the way to the

00:46:34.533 --> 00:46:38.433
bottom, and that can take a
couple hours to do, and ship

00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:39.633
time is very expensive.

00:46:39.633 --> 00:46:43.200
So now the field is moving
in the direction of these

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:51.467
autonomous explorers, where it's
an unmanned vehicle that

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:55.233
you launch from a ship but then
it pretty much goes its

00:46:55.233 --> 00:46:56.633
own way, and you
can control it.

00:46:56.633 --> 00:47:00.967
You talk to it with sonar,
sending acoustic signals to it

00:47:00.967 --> 00:47:05.467
which it can receive, and it
will then cruise around in the

00:47:05.467 --> 00:47:08.533
ocean up, or down, or laterally,
measuring.

00:47:08.533 --> 00:47:11.133
Of course you don't get water
samples from this but you get

00:47:11.133 --> 00:47:14.067
temperature, conductivity,
and depth, because this

00:47:14.067 --> 00:47:16.000
has a CTD on board.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.400
And you can control it and move
it wherever you want,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.133
back and forth.

00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:23.833
In one area, if you think
conditions might be changing,

00:47:23.833 --> 00:47:27.033
or traversing larger parts of
the ocean, if you want to map

00:47:27.033 --> 00:47:31.800
out a big piece of
the ocean volume.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:35.200
So this is a new thing coming
on, it's quite exciting to

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:37.967
have this, and you can be back
in your office actually in a

00:47:37.967 --> 00:47:40.733
way, and this data is coming
out on your screen.

00:47:40.733 --> 00:47:43.400
It's pretty remarkable what
this will mean for

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.133
oceanography.

00:47:44.133 --> 00:47:46.767
This is just getting started,
so this is really opening up

00:47:46.767 --> 00:47:50.833
brand new doors for
understanding the oceans with

00:47:50.833 --> 00:47:53.933
these autonomous explorers.

00:47:53.933 --> 00:47:55.200
Any questions on that?

00:47:57.533 --> 00:47:59.833
OK.

00:47:59.833 --> 00:48:02.633
So what do you get
from this then?

00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:04.267
We're almost out of
time, but here's a

00:48:04.267 --> 00:48:08.033
typical ocean sounding.

00:48:08.033 --> 00:48:12.867
Temperature, salinity, and
density, versus depth.

00:48:12.867 --> 00:48:16.900
So on this plot, zero is taken
to be sea level, and this goes

00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.533
down to about 4000 meters which
is almost the depth to

00:48:19.533 --> 00:48:21.400
the abyssal plane.

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.900
Very often you find rapid
changes at first, and when the

00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:30.400
temperature drops from warm
surface to colder values

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.800
beneath, that region of strong
temperature gradient is

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.500
referred to as the
thermocline.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.500
And you'll hear that term over
and over again, it's very

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:41.133
important in the ocean,
this thermocline.

00:48:41.133 --> 00:48:44.233
In this particular sounding,
it started about 200 meters

00:48:44.233 --> 00:48:47.000
below the surface, and by the
time you got down to 500 or

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.733
600 meters, you're at a
temperature of about four

00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:53.300
degrees Celsius, and then
eventually down to just one

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:54.600
degree Celsius.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:00.767
Whereas at the surface you had
25, 26, 27 degrees Celsius.

00:49:00.767 --> 00:49:07.700
The salinity in this case was
large at the surface, 34.9,

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.833
became a bit fresher as you
dropped down through what's

00:49:10.833 --> 00:49:15.033
called the halocline, and then
became slowly a little bit

00:49:15.033 --> 00:49:16.533
saltier beneath.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:25.333
Now the density of seawater is
controlled primarily by the

00:49:25.333 --> 00:49:28.800
temperature and the salinity.

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.233
The density is a very important
quantity, but if you

00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:34.833
know temperature and you know
salinity, you can compute or

00:49:34.833 --> 00:49:37.067
you can measure the density.

00:49:37.067 --> 00:49:41.400
So what's plotted in this final
panel, is the density

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:46.600
derived from the measured
temperature and salinity.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:51.300
And it shows a lower density
water near the surface by the

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:56.967
way, the units are in grams
per cubic centimeter here,

00:49:56.967 --> 00:49:59.600
remember fresh water has
a density of about

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.167
one in those units.

00:50:02.167 --> 00:50:05.100
So this is a little bit denser
than fresh water, and gets

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.533
even denser by the time you
get down to the bottom

00:50:07.533 --> 00:50:11.200
primarily because of the
temperature in this case.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:13.767
The colder temperature is giving
rise to the lower--to

00:50:13.767 --> 00:50:19.333
the higher density in
the deep ocean.

00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.567
I think I'm out of time, so
we're going to continue this

00:50:25.567 --> 00:50:28.833
next time and talk about the
concept of static stability.

00:50:28.833 --> 00:50:31.267
When will water remain
in layers?

00:50:31.267 --> 00:50:33.800
When will it overturn
to form convection?

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.633
And this will be the starting
point for that discussion.

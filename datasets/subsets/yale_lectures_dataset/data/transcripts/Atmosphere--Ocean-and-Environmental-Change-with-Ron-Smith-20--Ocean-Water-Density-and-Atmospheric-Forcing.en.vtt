00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.867
RONALD SMITH: So now we
are into this new section of

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:06.667
the course, oceanography.

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:11.700
And last time I gave an overview
of the nature of the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.833
ocean basins, basically the
geometry of the basins in

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.267
which the water sits.

00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:23.533
We connected that to plate
tectonics, both to make the

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:28.033
point that those ocean basins
are changing through geologic

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:33.633
time, but also to get at this
curious issue of how the

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.100
oceans are not just kind of a
random roughness on the Earth,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.567
but they really represent two
basic levels of Earth crust.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:48.367
The continental crust which
sits a bit higher, and the

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:50.333
ocean crust which sits
a bit lower.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.700
And that's why there are these
vast areas of the ocean that

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.100
are at about the same depth
below sea level,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.633
these abyssal planes.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.867
It's an oversimplification to
say, of course, that the ocean

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:08.900
basins have flat bottoms like
a bathtub or something.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.467
But there is a little bit of a
tendency that way because they

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:14.667
do have--they do have ocean
crust beneath them which

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.133
floats at a certain level and
gives you the depth of about 5

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.833
kilometers in many, many places
around the world ocean.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.400
Some places are deeper, some
places are shallower, but

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.933
there is that reference level
from which we work.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:32.000
Any questions on that?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.167
Then we moved into a discussion
of how to measure

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:40.367
salinity and temperature in the
oceans, and I talked about

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.367
some of the methods
to do that.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.467
And I wanted to pursue that just
a little bit further, and

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:49.400
then get into some quantitative
methods for

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.767
estimating how the atmosphere
forces various things that go

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:54.500
on in the ocean.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.233
So let me just start here, and
I showed you this last time.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:04.533
This is a typical
ocean sounding.

00:02:04.533 --> 00:02:09.733
Zero refers to sea level, and
then depth is in meters below

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:31.300
that, and this one going
down to 4,000 meters.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.867
The temperature is shown here
with a distinct cooling as you

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:38.067
go down that starts pretty
quickly below the surface.

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.867
Maybe in this case, just a
couple hundred meters below

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:46.633
the surface you go from a
mixed layer to a strong

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:51.733
gradient region called the
thermocline, "cline" referring

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:56.567
to change, and "thermo",
of course, referring to

00:02:56.567 --> 00:02:57.600
temperature.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.733
Then you get down to
temperatures below that that

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:04.067
are four, five, six degrees
Celsius and colder, and that

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:08.200
fills most of the interior
of the ocean basin.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.033
So this point I was emphasizing
last time about

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:14.367
how the surface temperature does
not represent the deep

00:03:14.367 --> 00:03:18.733
ocean temperature is
shown nicely here.

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.167
Salinity is somewhat similar
in that you can have strong

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:24.500
gradients near the air surface,
but more uniform

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.567
conditions below.

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:30.267
In this case, it's saltier, then
gets a bit fresher, than

00:03:30.267 --> 00:03:33.100
gets very slowly
saltier below.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.033
But always staying in this
remarkably narrow range

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:41.600
between 34 and 35 and 1/2
parts per thousand.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.067
Then the dynamical quantity
we're interested in is the

00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:49.433
seawater density with units
that you're familiar with,

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:52.600
kilograms per cubic meter,
for example.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.900
And that is a generally
a function of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.567
temperature and salinity.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:04:00.933
The warmer the water is, the
more it expands a little bit

00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:04.100
and its density is less.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.933
The colder it is, the
more it contracts,

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:09.167
the density is greater.

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:14.467
And salt, when you add salt to
water, the salt goes a little

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:18.600
bit into the pores between the
water molecules, which

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.667
increases the density.

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:23.333
So the greater the salt content
the greater is the

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:26.700
density, and the fresher
the water is the less

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.133
is the water density.

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:32.167
And since density is what
gravity acts on, we're

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:33.267
particularly interested
in this.

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:36.100
For example, if you wanted to
apply the hydrostatic relation

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.533
to find out how fast pressure
increases with depth, you'd

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:47.167
want to use the density derived
from the salinity and

00:04:47.167 --> 00:04:49.833
the temperature.

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:54.700
The word pycnocline is used when
you're referring to this

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.433
gradient region as it
applies to density.

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:02.233
So here it's the halocline
referring to the salt, there

00:05:02.233 --> 00:05:04.767
the thermocline referring to
the temperature, and the

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:09.100
pycnocline refers to that
combined quantity which is the

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.100
density of the water.

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:18.533
These profiles vary from place
to place in the world ocean.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.333
For example, the high latitudes
where you might have

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:25.000
a lot of precipitation and
because it's cold, not very

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.600
much evaporation.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.433
The surface waters, notice the
salinity scale is reversed on

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:33.933
this diagram.

00:05:33.933 --> 00:05:38.800
The water might be a little
less saline at the surface

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.100
than it is down deep.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.533
Whereas in the tropics, for
example, in the belt of

00:05:44.533 --> 00:05:48.100
deserts, the descending branch
of the Hadley cell, you'd have

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.900
a lot of evaporation, but very
little precipitation.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.433
So the water near the surface
would be salty there, but not

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:55.967
at the bottom.

00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:59.667
The bottom is more
homogeneous.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:10.033
Let's take a look at the salt
itself, and this will connect

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:13.433
a little bit with the lab that
you're currently writing up.

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:19.833
So if you take a kilogram of
seawater, about 965 grams of

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:28.133
that is water, H2O, and about
34.4 of that is in weight, in

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:30.133
mass, grams, is the salt.

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:35.500
Then if you break up that little
salt wedge into its

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.900
chemical compositions you get
this little pie chart here.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.233
It shows the most
abundant ions.

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:46.467
So assuming that this quantity,
these chemicals

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:48.967
break apart when they dissolve
in the water into their

00:06:48.967 --> 00:06:51.433
positive and negative ions.

00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:55.567
By far the largest contribution
is the chlorine,

00:06:55.567 --> 00:07:03.200
18.96 grams of the 34, a little
more than half of that

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.933
salt mass is due to
the chlorine.

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:09.233
And let's look at the other
negative ions here.

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:13.400
There's a sulfate radical,
SO4, and there's a

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.200
bicarbonate, HCO3 with minus
signs for the charge.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.500
Then we come to the cat ions,
which is what you're studying

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.467
in the lab this week.

00:07:24.467 --> 00:07:28.000
The dominant ones are sodium,
which is by far and away the

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.033
most abundant.

00:07:30.033 --> 00:07:34.233
But also we have magnesium,
calcium, and potassium.

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:37.467
Those are the four things that
you have data for in the lab

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:43.133
as you go from fresh water
river into the ocean.

00:07:43.133 --> 00:07:46.367
So you might want to compare
these numbers that I have here

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:54.667
in lecture, the 10.56 grams
per kilogram of seawater.

00:07:54.667 --> 00:08:03.033
The 1.27 for the magnesium, 0.04
for calcium, and 0.38 for

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:04.500
potassium with the
values you had.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:11.667
But just remember, when we got
to Long Island Sound we only

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:15.567
had a salinity of about half
that of ocean water.

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:21.300
So you should divide these
numbers approximately in half,

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:26.867
or double your numbers before
you do the comparisons.

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:30.000
But I think that'd be useful to
try to understand how our

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.767
measurements agree with the
textbook values for what makes

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:36.333
up the salts.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.100
The reason they can make a
diagram like this is these

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.767
relative proportions are the
same everywhere you go in the

00:08:42.767 --> 00:08:43.633
world ocean.

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:47.600
Even when the salinity varies a
little bit, maybe down to 34

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.533
or up to 36.

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:53.967
These all increase
in proportion.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:59.300
So that these relative numbers
are quite stable when you go

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:04.400
from place to place in
the world ocean.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:11.133
And of course, our simple theory
of this is that this

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:16.400
represents an accumulation over
geologic time of small

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.133
amounts of these chemicals,
these salts, that have come

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:23.633
into the ocean from rivers.

00:09:23.633 --> 00:09:27.233
And you're testing that idea
in using your lab data.

00:09:31.967 --> 00:09:33.233
Any questions there?

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:39.800
Now, you remember in the
atmosphere we spent a good

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.200
deal of time talking about
static stability, that is, we

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.233
looked at the role of the
atmospheric lapse rate how the

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:51.100
temperature changes in the
vertical to whether parcels

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.900
can rise and fall
easily or not.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.833
Or whether that atmosphere might
even be unstable and

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:00.000
break down to convection.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.833
So we defined an unstable lapse
rate, a stable lapse

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:07.367
rate, the inversion, which was
an example of a very stable

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:08.433
lapse rate.

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:11.700
We're interested in the same
kind of analysis in the ocean.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.533
But there's a couple of
essential differences.

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:21.067
One is that the ocean density
depends not just on

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:24.900
temperature, but on
salinity too.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.233
So we'll have to take into
account both of those

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:28.033
quantities.

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:31.133
We'll do that simply by
computing the density.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:34.300
We'll base our stability
analysis on water density,

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.200
rather than on temperature
or salinity alone.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.767
The other big difference
is that while air is

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:45.033
compressible, so as a parcel
lifts in the atmosphere and

00:10:45.033 --> 00:10:49.000
moves to lower pressure, it
expands does work on its

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.167
environment and its temperature
changes.

00:10:51.167 --> 00:10:55.567
That affect is very, very
small in the oceans.

00:10:55.567 --> 00:11:00.533
It's not exactly zero, but it
is so small that for many

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:05.700
quick calculations we ignore
that volume change and that

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:09.933
so-called adiabatic cooling or
adiabatic warming as air

00:11:09.933 --> 00:11:12.500
parcels rise up and down
in the atmosphere.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.000
We ignore that in the ocean.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.800
So because of these two
differences, the idea of what

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.133
determines stability in the
atmosphere and the ocean are

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:28.300
significantly different.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.100
The basic principle is that
while temperature and salinity

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.933
can either increase or decrease
with depth, the

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:40.367
density derived from them must
always increase with depth.

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:47.967
We saw that in the earlier
diagram here that the

00:11:47.967 --> 00:11:51.667
salinity, for example, decreased
with depth, then

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:52.900
increased with depth.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.767
But when I computed the density
it increased smoothly.

00:11:57.767 --> 00:12:03.467
If there was ever a layer where
the density got less

00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:06.367
with depth, that would be an
unstable layer, and it would

00:12:06.367 --> 00:12:08.867
immediately cause convection
and would mix.

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:14.633
Years ago when I first starting
out, I was looking at

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:18.667
some CTD data from a
ship and thought I

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:22.633
found an unstable layer.

00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:25.267
Went running up to the chief
scientist to show him this

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:28.700
remarkable discovery, and he
quickly pointed out where I'd

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.933
made a mistake in
my calculations.

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:34.867
So once again, the ocean
was found to be stable.

00:12:34.867 --> 00:12:37.400
It's been proven many,
many times.

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.267
The point is, you could have
an unstable layer, but it

00:12:40.267 --> 00:12:44.133
would exist only minutes because
immediately convection

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:48.000
would begin, that layer would
mix, and you might produce a

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.400
layer of constant density from
that mixing, but you would be

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.633
unlikely to sustain any layer
that is unstable.

00:12:55.633 --> 00:12:57.900
So you should always expect
to find this kind of

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.067
relationship, and if you don't,
you've either made a

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:04.333
wonderful discovery, or somewhat
more likely you've

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:08.500
screwed up your calculations
when you compute a density

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:12.333
from temperature and salinity.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:15.233
So it's a very important
principle.

00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:19.233
Probably almost universally true
in the atmosphere--in the

00:13:19.233 --> 00:13:21.467
oceans, sorry.

00:13:21.467 --> 00:13:24.867
So yeah, so there it is.

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:31.833
Now, this diagram is nice
because it combines together

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:37.833
hundreds of CTD and Nansen
bottle data sets from three of

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:41.300
the major world ocean basins the
Pacific Ocean, the Indian

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.433
Ocean, and the Atlantic Ocean.

00:13:43.433 --> 00:13:46.100
What I like even better about
this diagram is that it's

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.167
superimposed.

00:13:47.167 --> 00:13:53.200
These balloons of data are
superimposed on a diagram that

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.167
has lines of constant
density on it.

00:13:56.167 --> 00:13:59.700
Let me walk you through those
lines first. So on this axis

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.433
is the salinity in parts per
thousand that we're used to

00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:05.733
working with, PPT.

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:09.567
On this axis is temperature
in degrees Celsius.

00:14:09.567 --> 00:14:14.433
And then these lines are lines
of constant seawater density.

00:14:17.033 --> 00:14:20.833
And by the way, so what
is this unit here?

00:14:20.833 --> 00:14:27.833
This unit is the density of
seawater with the 1 and the 0

00:14:27.833 --> 00:14:29.733
dropped off.

00:14:29.733 --> 00:14:35.967
So you would read
this as 1,028.5

00:14:35.967 --> 00:14:41.700
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.933
And since it only changes in
those last couple of digits,

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:49.467
we don't want to keep writing
that 10 in front of all of

00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:50.833
those values.

00:14:50.833 --> 00:14:54.367
But you can see that the density
is greater down here,

00:14:54.367 --> 00:14:57.433
29, 28.5, and 28.

00:14:57.433 --> 00:15:04.833
And that corresponds to salty
water and low temperatures.

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:10.600
And the seawater density is less
up here, 25, 24.4--24.5,

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.900
and 24 for high temperatures
and low salinity.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:18.833
So that's as we thought
it would be.

00:15:18.833 --> 00:15:20.067
Are there any questions
on that?

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:24.933
There's a couple of other things
I'd like you to notice

00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:27.433
about this diagram.

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:31.200
Up in the warmer temperature
region, up near the top of the

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:38.600
diagram, because of the way
these lines are tilted, the

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.100
density is most sensitive
to temperature changes.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.200
Whereas down in the colder
regions where the lines are

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.567
tilted more like this, the
density is more sensitive to

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:52.967
salinity changes.

00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:57.867
So when you're talking to a
tropical oceanographer, and we

00:15:57.867 --> 00:16:02.533
have one in our department,
Professor Fedorov. He is

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:04.900
usually most interested in
talking to you about the

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.867
temperature profiles
in the ocean.

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:10.667
Of course, he hasn't forgotten
that salinity

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:11.933
plays a role in this.

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:15.667
But in the tropical in the warm
parts of the ocean, the

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:20.200
temperature is the primary
control on the density.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.500
If you're talking to an Arctic
oceanographer, and we have one

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.333
of those in our department,
Mary-Louise Timmermans.

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:31.100
She's usually most interested in
understanding the salinity

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.833
field because the salinity field
hacking down here, as

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:40.833
you can see, is more in control
of the density field

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.633
in the colder regions
of the ocean.

00:16:43.633 --> 00:16:46.333
So I don't want to exaggerate
that too far.

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:51.033
Both are always playing a role,
but in warm areas it's

00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:54.700
mostly the temperature, in cold
areas it's mostly the

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.700
salinity that's controlling
the density.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.100
Any questions on this diagram?

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.067
So let's look at these
big kind of balloons.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:14.433
The Pacific Ocean is generally
a little fresher, and maybe

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:18.333
even a little bit warmer than
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.967
There is a little part down here
which is common to both

00:17:23.967 --> 00:17:26.367
oceans, they come together
down there, called the

00:17:26.367 --> 00:17:27.933
Antarctic Bottom Water.

00:17:27.933 --> 00:17:30.667
We're going to be talking about
that probably next time.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:34.500
It's a mass of water that's
produced near Antarctica.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.767
It flows Northward along the
bottom of the ocean, and we

00:17:37.767 --> 00:17:40.333
find it in both the Atlantic
and the Pacific.

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.633
So there's a common element.

00:17:41.633 --> 00:17:44.767
But other than that, there
is a general systematic

00:17:44.767 --> 00:17:49.367
difference between the Pacific
and the Atlantic Ocean.

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:52.267
And that, of course, has to do
with atmospheric controls,

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:53.767
which I'm just about
to get to.

00:17:56.833 --> 00:17:59.667
If you do a cross-section,
this happens to be a

00:17:59.667 --> 00:18:03.333
North-South cross-section
through the Atlantic Ocean

00:18:03.333 --> 00:18:05.233
from high latitudes to low.

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:06.533
Perhaps you can't read
in the back, but

00:18:06.533 --> 00:18:08.633
the Equator is there.

00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:12.700
10 degrees North, 20, on up to
60 degrees North, and on down

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:17.867
to minus 70 degrees latitude,
70 South.

00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:22.933
Here's a depth scale going from
0 down to 6 kilometers.

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:26.633
And then the horizontal scale
is what I indicated.

00:18:26.633 --> 00:18:29.567
And contoured here
is temperature.

00:18:29.567 --> 00:18:34.733
Temperature actually gets a
little bit below 0 here.

00:18:34.733 --> 00:18:36.000
Minus 0.2.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.667
But by the time you're up in
here it's 1.2 degrees, 2.4.

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:46.200
And then you've got some strong
gradients near the top,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.067
well that's the thermocline, and
then near the surface of

00:18:50.067 --> 00:18:54.167
the ocean in the mid-latitudes
and low latitudes, you have

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:59.633
this little lens of warm water
floating on the surface.

00:18:59.633 --> 00:19:05.167
Many of you I expect have been
swimming in a fresh water lake

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:06.400
in early summer.

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:14.833
You may have noticed that as
you swim out, the water's

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.667
pretty comfortable in terms of
this temperature, but when you

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:20.867
stop swimming and let your
legs dangle down a bit,

00:19:20.867 --> 00:19:24.000
suddenly it's a lot
colder down there.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.100
What's happening is that that
fresh water that's warm is a

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:29.633
little bit less dense
than the cold water.

00:19:29.633 --> 00:19:32.900
So it floats in a little
layer on top.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:35.200
Well that's exactly what's
going on here.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:39.167
There's salinity involved, but
mostly it's a temperature

00:19:39.167 --> 00:19:43.367
control, and you've got a warm
layer of water kind of

00:19:43.367 --> 00:19:50.933
floating in a broad, deep,
cold layer of ocean.

00:19:50.933 --> 00:19:54.000
And you'll find this as you go
North to South in all of the

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.533
world's oceans, you'll find
this thermocline that

00:19:57.533 --> 00:20:00.967
separates this warm sphere from
the deep cold sphere.

00:20:00.967 --> 00:20:03.933
That's kind of a common element
in both the Atlantic,

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:06.300
the Pacific, and the
Indian ocean.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.400
So we'll talk more about
that later on.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.367
Any questions on what
this diagram shows?

00:20:11.367 --> 00:20:14.933
By the way, this blue water
here, that's that Antarctic

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:17.767
Bottom Water that I
was talking about.

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:19.000
I'll come back to that.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.033
Are there any other simple
analogies to this?

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:30.333
Well, I would point you to the
Great Salt Lake as kind of an

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:32.367
analogy to the world ocean.

00:20:32.367 --> 00:20:35.900
The Great Salt Lake
unlike most lakes

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.033
doesn't have an outflow.

00:20:39.033 --> 00:20:42.700
When water flows into the Great
Salt Lake in Utah, it

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.267
doesn't spend a few weeks there
and then flow in some

00:20:45.267 --> 00:20:46.567
river into the ocean.

00:20:46.567 --> 00:20:47.300
No.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.300
It basically stays there
until it evaporates.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.633
This is a no outflow lake.

00:20:54.633 --> 00:20:59.967
And for that reason, you get the
same kind of concentration

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:05.633
of salts, the same process,
as you do in the ocean.

00:21:05.633 --> 00:21:10.700
So it's a little mini ocean, if
you like, in the sense that

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.033
it has to evaporate its water,
get rid of it, and therefore,

00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:15.033
it concentrates the salts.

00:21:15.033 --> 00:21:18.467
Now, in this case, it
concentrates the salts even

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:19.967
much more than the ocean does.

00:21:19.967 --> 00:21:21.967
The salinity is three
to five times

00:21:21.967 --> 00:21:24.133
saltier than in the ocean.

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:27.433
Has anybody swum in the
Great Salt Lake?

00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:29.767
Dip your body in it?

00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:30.867
But you've heard about
it, right?

00:21:30.867 --> 00:21:35.100
The remarkable thing is
how high you float.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.700
You're sitting there, and maybe
from here on up you're

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.000
out of the water.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.500
Why?

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:46.767
Because the water is salty,
and therefore more dense.

00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:50.167
Following Archimedes rule, the
denser the water is, the more

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:53.267
mass you're displacing, the more
the buoyancy force, the

00:21:53.267 --> 00:21:54.067
higher you float.

00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:59.000
So this is a good thing to think
about when you're trying

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.500
to understand basically
how oceans work.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.733
It's kind of a little
mini ocean.

00:22:08.467 --> 00:22:12.900
Now, the subject I was going to
get into today, and I will

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.567
get into it is atmospheric
forcing of the ocean.

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:21.333
For the most part, any motions
you have in the ocean, in

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.833
fact, almost everything that
goes on in the ocean, is

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:31.167
driven from above by either
sunlight hitting the ocean, or

00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:34.333
some other interaction with
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:36.433
Now is there any forcing
from below at all?

00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:40.467
Well there is a little bit of
geothermal heat coming out of

00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:42.400
the bottom of the ocean
basins, but

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.867
that's quite small.

00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:48.800
So except for that, it's pretty
much the oceans are

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.867
driven by the atmosphere
from above.

00:22:51.867 --> 00:22:53.800
These three things are
how that happens.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:01.133
You can add or remove heat at
the top of the ocean, either

00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:04.233
by radiation, the Sun's
radiation, or long-wave

00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:07.167
radiation emitted from
the ocean surface.

00:23:07.167 --> 00:23:09.533
Or by contact with
the atmosphere.

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:13.867
if you have cold air, that'll
suck heat out of the ocean.

00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:19.133
If you have warm air that'll
conduct heat into the ocean.

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:23.900
Or you can add fresh water by
precipitation, or remove fresh

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.033
water by evaporation, leaving
the salt behind.

00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:32.933
These two things will change the
salinity of the surface,

00:23:32.933 --> 00:23:34.233
and therefore, the density.

00:23:34.233 --> 00:23:36.300
And this one will change the
temperature and, therefore,

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:36.967
the density.

00:23:36.967 --> 00:23:39.000
Or you've got the wind stress.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.333
You've got the wind blowing
over the ocean surface

00:23:42.333 --> 00:23:45.433
transferring some momentum to
the ocean, and getting the

00:23:45.433 --> 00:23:47.800
ocean moving in that way.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:52.033
So we're going to need to
understand each of these three

00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:57.367
mechanisms. For example, here
is our best estimate of the

00:23:57.367 --> 00:24:00.133
heat flux in and out
of the ocean.

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:08.467
Basically, where you get, for
example, cold water and warm

00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:12.333
air, the heat is going into the
ocean, and that's shown as

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:15.100
positive on this diagram.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.833
Where heat is coming out you've
got the blue or the red

00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:20.933
color shown as negative.

00:24:20.933 --> 00:24:22.767
But it varies from
place to place.

00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:24.967
It depends on the
air temperature.

00:24:24.967 --> 00:24:28.000
It depends on how much sunlight
is being received.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.200
It depends on the water
temperature, whether heat is

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:34.400
going into the ocean or whether
heat is coming out.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.267
We'll talk about this

00:24:35.267 --> 00:24:38.100
quantitatively in just a moment.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.467
Then the other one is E minus
P or P minus E. This one is

00:24:42.467 --> 00:24:44.433
evaporation minus
precipitation.

00:24:44.433 --> 00:24:47.267
The sign is derived
in that way.

00:24:47.267 --> 00:24:53.767
So whenever water is
evaporating, you get a yellow

00:24:53.767 --> 00:24:57.300
signature here, and the
units on this are in

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.367
millimeters per day.

00:24:58.367 --> 00:25:03.567
How much water is being peeled
off and evaporated in terms of

00:25:03.567 --> 00:25:05.767
a layer depth per day.

00:25:05.767 --> 00:25:09.000
Whereas in the blue, and you
notice it coincides with the

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.833
ITCZ, for example, where you
have heavy precipitation,

00:25:13.833 --> 00:25:16.667
precipitation exceeds
evaporation.

00:25:16.667 --> 00:25:20.733
So the sign of this quantity of
negative shows up as blue.

00:25:20.733 --> 00:25:24.033
Then you get up into
mid-latitudes again where it's

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:26.900
colder, there's less
evaporation, but you have the

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.067
frontal storms, and once again,
you're getting an

00:25:29.067 --> 00:25:32.367
excess of precipitation
over evaporation.

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:37.467
So this is driving motions
in the ocean as well.

00:25:37.467 --> 00:25:42.067
Then the final one is the winds
over the ocean, which

00:25:42.067 --> 00:25:43.333
change a bit with the season.

00:25:43.333 --> 00:25:45.833
There's January, there's July.

00:25:45.833 --> 00:25:48.067
But generally you've got
Westerlies in the

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:49.867
mid-latitudes and Easterlies
in the low

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.100
latitudes in both seasons.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:57.200
And that is generating motions
in the ocean itself.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:02.067
So that is where we'll end
the pictures today.

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:05.967
And I want to get into
quantifying these things.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:28.567
So here I've repeated those
three ways in which the

00:26:28.567 --> 00:26:31.000
atmosphere forces the ocean.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.133
Adding or removing heat,
precipitation and/or

00:26:34.133 --> 00:26:38.133
evaporation, and the
wind stress.

00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:41.000
Now, I want to make a further
distinction from this.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.100
I've got a little--I've drawn
a little cartoon down here.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.533
Here's the cloud that's
precipitating, adding fresh

00:26:46.533 --> 00:26:48.800
water to the surface
of the ocean.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.667
There's some evaporation,
that's this one.

00:26:51.667 --> 00:26:54.267
Here's some heat being added
or removed, either by

00:26:54.267 --> 00:26:58.367
radiation or by the effect
of the atmosphere itself.

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:02.000
And here's the wind stress I'm
going to use Greek letter Tau

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.867
to represent that.

00:27:02.867 --> 00:27:05.600
But I've indicated that there's
a layer which feels

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:11.133
these inputs directly, and
that's called the depth of

00:27:11.133 --> 00:27:16.333
that capital D. That will vary
from time to time and place to

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:20.233
place, but typically that's a
very small fraction of the

00:27:20.233 --> 00:27:21.867
ocean depth.

00:27:21.867 --> 00:27:28.800
When I do examples, I often
set D equal to 100 meters.

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.200
Roughly only the first few
tens or couple of hundred

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.867
meters feels these
inputs directly.

00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:39.167
The rest of the world ocean will
feel them, but it'll be

00:27:39.167 --> 00:27:41.267
an indirect influence.

00:27:41.267 --> 00:27:43.867
Something coming not directly
from the atmospheric input,

00:27:43.867 --> 00:27:48.000
but something then coming out of
this other layer that feels

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.133
a direct influence.

00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:53.200
So be aware that I'm making this
distinction for all three

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.667
of these categories
of forcing.

00:27:56.667 --> 00:28:00.333
My first job is to figure out
what does it do to this layer

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:03.833
that feels the influence
directly.

00:28:03.833 --> 00:28:05.533
The first one will
be adding heat.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.633
And you remember that if you add
a certain amount of heat

00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:18.833
to a mass, M, with a heat
capacity C sub P, it's

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:22.900
temperature will change by
delta T. We've had that

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.367
formula before.

00:28:24.367 --> 00:28:30.967
If I write that in a per unit
area basis, I'll divide the Q

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:35.200
by A, and the mass by
A, and I'll leave

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.467
everything else the same.

00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:41.367
I've just divided both sides
through by the area that I'm

00:28:41.367 --> 00:28:44.600
considering, which in
oceanography we don't usually

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.700
even consider that area.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:51.767
We just do these calculations
on a per unit area basis.

00:28:51.767 --> 00:28:57.867
The mass per unit area, if you
think of a piece of the ocean,

00:28:57.867 --> 00:29:04.267
a little cylinder of area A, its
total mass is going to be

00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:10.867
its volume times the density
of the water.

00:29:10.867 --> 00:29:15.367
And the volume is going to be
the product of A and D where D

00:29:15.367 --> 00:29:19.233
is the depth of that cylinder.

00:29:19.233 --> 00:29:24.933
So the mass per unit area here,
which divides out the A

00:29:24.933 --> 00:29:31.933
is going to be the product of
rho D, the water density times

00:29:31.933 --> 00:29:35.100
the depth of the layer
that I'm considering.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.767
So then let me just take that
and plug it into this formula.

00:29:39.767 --> 00:29:46.400
I get Q over A that's the heat
being added per unit area.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:52.367
Plugging this and I get rho D
CP delta T, and solving that

00:29:52.367 --> 00:30:00.600
for delta T, I get Q over A
over rho D C sub P. And I

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.033
think we've seen that
formula before, but

00:30:03.033 --> 00:30:05.767
there we have it again.

00:30:05.767 --> 00:30:08.833
This will tell you how much the
temperature of the surface

00:30:08.833 --> 00:30:12.067
layer of the ocean changes
when you put in a certain

00:30:12.067 --> 00:30:14.033
amount of heat per unit area.

00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:17.500
And it depends on the density of
the seawater, the depth of

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.600
the layer over which you're
distributing that heat, and

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.033
the heat capacity of water.

00:30:25.033 --> 00:30:35.700
So a quick example of that I'm
going to take a solar flux of

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.133
1,000 watts per square meter.

00:30:39.133 --> 00:30:41.967
Let's say we have sunlight
hitting the surface of the

00:30:41.967 --> 00:30:44.200
ocean with that kind
of intensity.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:31:00.667
That persists for one day,
which is 86,400 seconds.

00:31:00.667 --> 00:31:02.500
So let's say that persists
for one day.

00:31:05.633 --> 00:31:11.733
And that heat is distributed
over a depth of 1,000 meters.

00:31:11.733 --> 00:31:14.800
How much will the temperature
of the surface ocean

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.267
change in that case?

00:31:16.267 --> 00:31:19.033
Let's just put the numbers into
the formula that I'm just

00:31:19.033 --> 00:31:21.133
extending this formula over.

00:31:21.133 --> 00:31:24.967
So to get the heat,
I need to multiply

00:31:24.967 --> 00:31:27.033
remember this is watts.

00:31:27.033 --> 00:31:29.967
That's a rate of putting
in heat.

00:31:29.967 --> 00:31:32.333
A watt is a Joule per second.

00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:38.067
So I need to multiply the time
by the watts to get Joules per

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:41.733
square meter, which is what Q
over A means, that's Joules

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.667
per square meter.

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:50.000
So that's going to be 8.64 times
10 to the seventh Joules

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.933
per square meter up top that's
just the product

00:31:52.933 --> 00:31:54.267
of those two numbers.

00:31:54.267 --> 00:32:01.667
And then down below I'm going
to put in a estimate for

00:32:01.667 --> 00:32:08.500
seawater density, a depth of
100 meters, and the heat

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:15.067
capacity for water which is
about 4,200 units of Joules

00:32:15.067 --> 00:32:18.967
per kilogram per degree.

00:32:18.967 --> 00:32:22.233
That's C sub P, you work that
out, and you might want to

00:32:22.233 --> 00:32:27.033
check me, but I got 0.2
degrees Celsius.

00:32:27.033 --> 00:32:32.667
So the warming turned out to be
pretty small because that

00:32:32.667 --> 00:32:37.533
heat got distributed over a
pretty great depth, and the

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:39.267
mass of that water
is large, and its

00:32:39.267 --> 00:32:40.967
heat capacity is large.

00:32:40.967 --> 00:32:46.033
So although I put in almost 10
to the eighth Joules for every

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:49.567
square meter, the rise in
temperature was pretty small.

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:49.933
Yeah.

00:32:49.933 --> 00:32:53.867
STUDENT: Is that supposed
to be 1000 meters?

00:32:53.867 --> 00:32:57.367
PROFESSOR: That's
supposed to be I made the

00:32:57.367 --> 00:33:00.167
mistake here, 100
meters, sorry.

00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:01.900
Thanks for pointing that out.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:03.167
100 meters, yeah.

00:33:03.167 --> 00:33:05.133
That'd be too deep.

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:08.667
Very rarely does the ocean mix
down to 1,000 meters, as you

00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:09.533
saw in the diagram.

00:33:09.533 --> 00:33:13.067
By the time you get down to
1,000 meters you've got a lot

00:33:13.067 --> 00:33:15.367
of gradients and things like
that, so it doesn't usually

00:33:15.367 --> 00:33:17.233
mix that deep.

00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:20.300
So you can apply this to a wide
variety of circumstances,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.100
depending how you alter
the input numbers.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.033
The heat could come from the Sun
like I've done, it could

00:33:26.033 --> 00:33:29.000
be a loss of heat by
radiating to space.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.533
It could be a heat transport
from the atmosphere in or out

00:33:32.533 --> 00:33:35.433
of the ocean, depending where
remember the diagram I showed

00:33:35.433 --> 00:33:37.767
you some parts of the
world is positive,

00:33:37.767 --> 00:33:38.900
some parts it's negative.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.867
So this number's going to depend
on where you are, the

00:33:41.867 --> 00:33:44.267
season of the year, and so on.

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.600
Now, the next one will
be number two.

00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:57.667
This is a little trickier.

00:33:57.667 --> 00:34:04.533
Let me define the salinity as
the mass of the salt over the

00:34:04.533 --> 00:34:08.433
mass of the water in any
particular sample that you

00:34:08.433 --> 00:34:13.733
have. I'm going to be looking
at change, so I'm going to

00:34:13.733 --> 00:34:19.600
define salinity at time 1 as
being the mass of salt at time

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.933
1 over the mass of
water at time 1.

00:34:21.933 --> 00:34:26.167
And salinity at time 2 as
being MS2 over MW2.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.533
But I'm not going to consider
cases where I'm adding and

00:34:33.533 --> 00:34:36.767
removing salt.

00:34:36.767 --> 00:34:39.033
That doesn't happen very
often in the ocean.

00:34:39.033 --> 00:34:42.167
Instead I'm going to consider
cases where I add and remove

00:34:42.167 --> 00:34:43.667
fresh water.

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:49.467
Either it rains, so I'm adding
fresh water, or it evaporates.

00:34:49.467 --> 00:34:52.600
When it evaporates it leaves
all the salt behind, so you

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.800
can say that I'm subtracting
fresh water.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.400
So I'm going to assume that in
the changes I'm about to

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.400
describe that MS1
is equal to MS2.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.433
So I'm not changing the mass of
salt in the sample, but I'm

00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:11.367
going to change the mass
of salt water.

00:35:14.433 --> 00:35:19.033
I'm going to define the change
in salinity as being S2 minus

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:24.733
S1, and just using these
formulas that'll be MS over M

00:35:24.733 --> 00:35:30.067
water 2 minus MS
over M water 1.

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:33.133
And notice I've dropped the
subscript now on the MS

00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:35.167
because I'm going to assume
that the mass of

00:35:35.167 --> 00:35:36.533
salt doesn't change.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:45.533
With just a little bit of
manipulation I can rewrite

00:35:45.533 --> 00:35:56.267
this as MS over M salt water
1, M water 1 over M water 2

00:35:56.267 --> 00:36:01.033
minus M Salt over M water 1.

00:36:01.033 --> 00:36:04.300
What I've done is just multiply
and divide the first

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.133
term by M water 1.

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:09.633
You see it there and there.

00:36:09.633 --> 00:36:12.333
I've just multiplied and divided
by the same number.

00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:18.900
But now this can be rewritten
as the salinity at time 1

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:30.000
times the bracket M water
1, M water 2 minus 1.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So the change in salinity is
related to the salinity you

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.200
started with, plus the ratio of
the fresh water you started

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.900
with to the fresh water
you ended with.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.500
That's an M sub W sub 1, and
an M sub W sub 2, the fresh

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.067
water that you have.

00:36:51.067 --> 00:36:55.067
Now I'm going to try to motivate
this a little bit

00:36:55.067 --> 00:36:55.900
geometrically.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:01.767
Imagine I've got a column of
seawater, perhaps some little

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:04.900
section of the surface layer of
the ocean I just sliced out

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.800
with a cookie cutter.

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.367
And then I add a layer
on top of it.

00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:15.133
It'll be capital D in its depth,
and then I'm going to

00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:21.633
put a little thin layer on top
of it with depth little d.

00:37:21.633 --> 00:37:25.500
Or alternatively, I could strip
off, I could evaporate,

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.733
a layer of depth little d.

00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:32.567
That would make the
seawater saltier.

00:37:32.567 --> 00:37:37.233
With that geometric
interpretation, I can write

00:37:37.233 --> 00:37:46.067
the ratio in my formula MW1 over
MW2 as being capital D

00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:50.667
over capital D plus little d.

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:55.000
In other words, I'm just adding
water, and that's going

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.433
to change the mass ratio
before and after.

00:38:00.433 --> 00:38:06.800
That allows me to rewrite this
formula finally to can you see

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.233
it if I do it here?

00:38:08.233 --> 00:38:12.400
So I'm going to take this
formula, divide through by the

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.900
S1 and use little
added formula.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:24.633
So delta S over S1 can be
written finally as big D over

00:38:24.633 --> 00:38:30.200
D plus little d minus 1, which
can be simplified to little d

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:33.100
over big D plus little d.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.467
That's the formula we're
going to use.

00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:46.433
If that seems confusing in
any way, all I've done is

00:38:46.433 --> 00:38:52.167
conserved salt, but change the
amount of fresh water, and

00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:53.667
therefore the salinity
changes.

00:38:53.667 --> 00:39:01.433
So if I add a layer of fresh
water of depth D with a minus

00:39:01.433 --> 00:39:06.233
sign there, that's going to
make the water less salty.

00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:08.167
The minus sign reminds
us of that.

00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:12.700
If D is positive, if I've added
fresh water, the ocean

00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.800
gets less salty.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:17.533
If I subtract by evaporating,
then D would be negative.

00:39:17.533 --> 00:39:20.100
Negative times a negative is
positive, and the salinity

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.233
would increase.

00:39:22.233 --> 00:39:24.067
So that's the way you'd
use this formula.

00:39:24.067 --> 00:39:25.733
Let's do an extreme
example to be sure

00:39:25.733 --> 00:39:28.500
this formula's correct.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:34.800
Let's say that I doubled
the depth.

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.300
I put a whole thick layer of
fresh water on there equal to

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.800
what I had originally
of seawater.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:49.100
Well then it would be minus
capital D over capital D plus

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:56.400
capital D. That quantity is
going to be minus 1/2.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.767
That means the salinity's going
to drop in half of what

00:39:59.767 --> 00:40:03.100
it was before because
I've added an equal

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.133
amount of fresh water.

00:40:04.133 --> 00:40:07.533
So that salt now had to
mix into twice the

00:40:07.533 --> 00:40:08.567
amount of fresh water.

00:40:08.567 --> 00:40:12.200
That's going to drop the
salinity exactly in half.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.633
Now this would be an
extreme example.

00:40:13.633 --> 00:40:15.900
Usually in the ocean we're just
talking about adding some

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.667
small fraction.

00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:23.000
So let me do a little more
realistic example of this.

00:40:39.967 --> 00:40:56.133
My example would be adding 1
meter of fresh water to 100

00:40:56.133 --> 00:40:57.433
meters of ocean water.

00:41:05.033 --> 00:41:06.833
How much will the
salinity change?

00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:22.533
So delta S over S1 is going to
be minus 1 over 100 plus 1.

00:41:22.533 --> 00:41:27.567
So that is approximately
minus 0.01.

00:41:27.567 --> 00:41:31.633
This is approximately 35 parts
per thousand let's say, the

00:41:31.633 --> 00:41:33.467
original salinity.

00:41:33.467 --> 00:41:38.933
So delta S is going to
be 1/100th of that.

00:41:38.933 --> 00:41:45.100
It's going to be 0.35 parts per
thousand, which means the

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.767
new S, the new salinity, I'll
call it here S2, is going to

00:41:50.767 --> 00:42:01.867
be 34.65 parts per thousand.

00:42:01.867 --> 00:42:06.533
I started with 35 parts per
thousand, 100 meter column,

00:42:06.533 --> 00:42:12.833
added 1 meter of fresh water on
top, mixed it all in, the

00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:17.367
salinity drops by 0.35 parts per
thousand, which takes me

00:42:17.367 --> 00:42:21.100
from 35 to 36.65.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.333
That would be a typical
situation.

00:42:23.333 --> 00:42:26.400
And that's a big difference,
considering that the full

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:29.867
range of ocean salinity
is only from about

00:42:29.867 --> 00:42:32.933
34 to 35 and 1/2.

00:42:32.933 --> 00:42:35.567
That's a big difference
in ocean salinity.

00:42:35.567 --> 00:42:39.233
And that'll cause circulations
to begin, because the seawater

00:42:39.233 --> 00:42:41.967
density will have changed.

00:42:41.967 --> 00:42:45.200
Any questions on that?

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.567
STUDENT: Is that only
for the surface?

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:48.167
PROFESSOR: Pardon me?

00:42:48.167 --> 00:42:49.233
STUDENT: Is that only
for the surface?

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:49.767
PROFESSOR: Yeah I don't

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.833
imagine well that's right.

00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:53.433
So that would affect this
top 100 meters.

00:42:53.433 --> 00:42:57.567
Then what happens later on to
the rest of the ocean, that

00:42:57.567 --> 00:42:58.833
would remain to be seen.

00:42:58.833 --> 00:43:03.033
If, for example, in this case,
I made it less dense, because

00:43:03.033 --> 00:43:05.667
I made it less saline, that
water would probably remain

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:07.300
floating there.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:10.967
If I had made it more dense, it
might find itself so dense

00:43:10.967 --> 00:43:13.633
that it would then fall to
the bottom of the ocean.

00:43:13.633 --> 00:43:15.400
But that's a separate
calculation.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:17.100
Here I'm just trying to
understand what happens to the

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.967
surface water when you
change its salinity.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:27.333
Now we turn to the third
type of forcing,

00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:28.600
which is wind stress.

00:43:40.367 --> 00:43:43.533
This is perhaps not quite as
obvious as the others.

00:43:43.533 --> 00:43:45.933
I don't think I've greatly
surprised you by either of

00:43:45.933 --> 00:43:47.000
these calculations here.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.167
It's pretty much common sense.

00:43:50.167 --> 00:43:53.567
But what happens when the wind
blows over the ocean?

00:43:53.567 --> 00:43:58.467
When the wind blows
over the ocean it

00:43:58.467 --> 00:44:01.500
produces a wind stress.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.867
Frictionally, just like when you
move your hand across the

00:44:03.867 --> 00:44:07.133
table pushing down, there's
a stress being

00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:08.100
applied on that table.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.033
That table starts to move
sometimes in the direction

00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:13.100
that you're pushing.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:14.500
And that's my question.

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.267
If I put the wind in that
direction, from left to right

00:44:17.267 --> 00:44:23.900
in this diagram, does the ocean
water begin to move in

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.800
the same direction?

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:31.667
Well, you're probably on your
guard because you know that

00:44:31.667 --> 00:44:35.933
the Coriolis force exists so
that some things are not quite

00:44:35.933 --> 00:44:39.533
as obvious cause and effect-wise
when you have the

00:44:39.533 --> 00:44:40.567
Coriolis force.

00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:42.567
In fact, here's what happens.

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:46.567
So I'm going to draw a plan view
here now, North, South,

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:50.467
East and West. I'm going to
imagine I've got a Westerly

00:44:50.467 --> 00:44:55.467
wind, that is a wind from West
to East. So the wind is

00:44:55.467 --> 00:44:57.600
blowing in that direction.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.100
The wind stress will also be
in that same direction.

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:06.533
I'd like to prove to you, in
the remaining three or four

00:45:06.533 --> 00:45:12.100
minutes, that when I push the
water in that direction it

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:13.867
goes to the right.

00:45:13.867 --> 00:45:15.667
It doesn't go in the direction
I'm pushing.

00:45:18.433 --> 00:45:22.533
This will involve a new kind
of force balance called the

00:45:22.533 --> 00:45:24.600
Ekman force balance.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.167
It has something in common
with geostrophic force

00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:37.200
balance, but it's also
quite different.

00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:44.633
So let's say that I start to
put this wind stress, it's

00:45:44.633 --> 00:45:47.000
going to--in the first few
minutes it is going to do the

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:47.533
obvious thing.

00:45:47.533 --> 00:45:50.267
It's going to start the water
moving towards East. But then

00:45:50.267 --> 00:45:55.367
as soon as it gets moving, if
feels the Coriolis force and

00:45:55.367 --> 00:45:57.633
it will begin to bend.

00:45:57.633 --> 00:46:05.567
After a few hours, I will argue
now, that the flow will

00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:10.367
be towards the South that'll
be the Ekman flow.

00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:13.900
To the right angles of that
will be the Coriolis force

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.633
acting on that Ekman flow.

00:46:16.633 --> 00:46:18.800
And that's going to be equal
and opposite to the wind

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.033
stress itself.

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:27.567
And so when you push on the
water on a rotating Earth with

00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:30.633
the frictional stress from the
wind, instead of moving in the

00:46:30.633 --> 00:46:33.067
direction you push, it moves
at right angles.

00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:38.700
To the right in the Northern
Hemisphere, to the south--I'm

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.533
sorry, to the left in the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:46:45.233 --> 00:46:47.700
We could do a calculation.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:52.000
I probably don't have time to
finish this today, but I can

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.900
do a calculation of how fast
that water will move.

00:47:00.333 --> 00:47:08.467
If I have, again, a column of
depth D, it has a mass given

00:47:08.467 --> 00:47:15.900
by AD rho across the area, the
height of the column, and the

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.233
density of seawater.

00:47:18.233 --> 00:47:23.133
If it begins to move you'll have
a Coriolis force given by

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:30.133
2, the mass, the speed, the
rotation rate of the Earth,

00:47:30.133 --> 00:47:32.833
and the sign of the latitude.

00:47:32.833 --> 00:47:37.033
That's going to have to balance
the wind stress.

00:47:37.033 --> 00:47:40.000
There's a nice empirical formula
for wind stress that

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.767
I'll give you.

00:47:42.767 --> 00:47:45.633
I won't derive it, it's just
an observational quantity.

00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.967
I've written there empirical,
which means it's an

00:47:47.967 --> 00:47:51.933
experimentally-derived
formula.

00:47:51.933 --> 00:47:56.900
It's given by constant 0.003
times the density of the air

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:59.667
blowing over the water's
surface times

00:47:59.667 --> 00:48:00.967
the wind speed squared.

00:48:07.167 --> 00:48:09.633
And this has units of Newtons
per square meter.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:26.233
So now, let me just equate those
two things following the

00:48:26.233 --> 00:48:29.733
prescription for the Ekman
layer force balance.

00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:35.900
I'm going to say when you've got
a well established balance

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:44.067
of this sort, then the Coriolis
force which is 2, let

00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:52.967
me substitute this in for MD
rho then comes U omega sin

00:48:52.967 --> 00:49:04.067
phi, must be equal to Taw acting
on that same area A.

00:49:04.067 --> 00:49:07.267
Since that's a force per unit
area, I need to multiply it by

00:49:07.267 --> 00:49:09.833
a surface area to
get a Newton.

00:49:09.833 --> 00:49:11.933
So I got Newtons and Newtons
on both sides.

00:49:11.933 --> 00:49:16.133
And then solving this for the
speed of the flow in the Ekman

00:49:16.133 --> 00:49:28.700
layer, I can cancel the A's,
and I have Taw over 2D rho

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:34.667
omega sign phi, sign
of the latitude.

00:49:34.667 --> 00:49:39.067
That is the box formula for
this part of how the

00:49:39.067 --> 00:49:42.367
atmosphere drives the ocean.

00:49:42.367 --> 00:49:47.200
If I know the wind speed
I can compute Taw.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.367
If I know Taw, the depth of
the layer that's being

00:49:50.367 --> 00:49:54.067
influenced directly, the density
of seawater, the

00:49:54.067 --> 00:49:56.533
rotation rate of the earth,
and the latitude, I can

00:49:56.533 --> 00:50:01.833
compute how fast this water
moves off to the right under

00:50:01.833 --> 00:50:04.767
the influence of the
wind stress.

00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:06.200
So we're out of time today.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.667
This needs a lot more
discussion.

00:50:07.667 --> 00:50:10.800
But you've got a problem you're
working on for the

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:13.833
problem sets where you need to
use that formula, I believe.

00:50:13.833 --> 00:50:18.233
And I will talk more about the
physics of this on Friday.

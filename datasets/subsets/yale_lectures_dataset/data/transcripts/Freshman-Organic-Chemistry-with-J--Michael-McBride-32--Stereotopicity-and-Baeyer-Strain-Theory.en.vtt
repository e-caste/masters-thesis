00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.747
Prof: Okay,
so we were talking last time

00:00:04.747 --> 00:00:08.180
about rotation in ethane,
and the fact that there was a

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.505
barrier,
and that you can measure the

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:11.080
barrier.
 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.719
And one way to measure the
barrier, the first way that the

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.465
barrier was measured,
was remarkably enough,

00:00:17.465 --> 00:00:21.255
by the heat capacity of ethane;
how much heat it takes to warm

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:22.760
it to a certain temperature.
 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.784
So that showed that the barrier
was about three kcal/mole,

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:31.020
but it didn't say what the
geometry of minimum energy was.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.840
Was it eclipsed,
as shown by the red line here,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.160
so that the eclipsed form is
the lowest in energy?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.410
Or was the favored form
staggered?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.670
And people differed in their
interpretation of that.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.986
Ultimately there was some
diffraction study,

00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:50.380
electron diffraction,
that showed that it was

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.460
staggered.
 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.511
But now the best word on this
nowadays is probably from really

00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:58.830
high-quality calculations.
 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.631
And you can see from this
paper, published in the

00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:04.082
Journal of Chemical
Physics in 2003,

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:06.358
that there's pretty good
agreement.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:11.781
All these various abbreviations
are various really high-quality

00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.879
computational results.
 

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:16.488
You can see at the top,
our experimental results,

00:01:16.488 --> 00:01:17.629
from heat capacity.
 

00:01:17.629 --> 00:01:20.650
It's about 1000 wavenumbers.
 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.825
A wavenumber is 2.86 small
calories, not kilocalories,

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:26.900
per mole.
 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.754
So there's heat capacity from
infrared spectroscopy,

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:33.930
from microwave,
from Raman spectroscopy.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.968
All these experiments give very
close to 2.9 kcal/mole,

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:40.810
or about 1000 wave numbers --
right?

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.750
-- within a couple of percent;
even less than that probably.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.730
And then all these calculations
give about 2.7 kcal/mole.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.560
And it doesn't make very much
difference.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.473
The first one of these -- some
of these aren't such very

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:59.185
high-quality calculations,
but some of them are very,

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:01.730
very high quality,
the best that can be done.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.450
And they all agree pretty much.
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950
So it's clear that the
staggered form is favored over

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.596
the eclipsed;
despite what everyone wrote in

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.110
the nineteenth century,
when they always wrote them

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.016
eclipsed,
and what whoever it was that

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:16.687
drew the picture for the
American Chemical Society of

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:19.780
their Molecule of the Week,
last week, drew too.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.241
He drew it eclipsed;
or she.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:22.878
Okay?
 

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:26.960
So anyhow, but then there's the
question why?

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.539
Why is it that the staggered
form is lower in energy than the

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.378
eclipsed?
 

00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:34.979
Why is there a three
kilocalorie barrier?

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.400
Well there's different points
of view on that.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.750
One is that the eclipsed form
is unstable;

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.710
that for some reason having it
eclipsed makes it unstable.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.641
The other one is that the
staggered form is unusually

00:02:49.641 --> 00:02:50.150
stable.
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.139
And what does this remind you
of, in terms of a question?

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.530
Students:
 Compared to what?

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.097
Prof: Compared to what?
 

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.300
What's unusual,
right?

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.250
Is what's unusual the eclipsed
form or the staggered form?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.710
Well from the point of view of
the eclipsed form,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.218
why would it be unstable?
 

00:03:10.218 --> 00:03:14.211
Well it could be that the
hydrogens repel one another,

00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:17.830
because just in space;
their van der Waals radii.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.388
Okay, but if you think about
that, then if you had a methyl

00:03:22.388 --> 00:03:26.474
in place of one of those
hydrogens, it's ever so much

00:03:26.474 --> 00:03:27.340
bigger.
 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.863
Therefore you should have a
much bigger barrier to rotation,

00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:34.240
of a methyl group in propane.
 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.823
But, in fact,
the barrier is almost exactly

00:03:36.823 --> 00:03:40.108
the same;
3.4, not ten or something like

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:40.628
that.
 

00:03:40.628 --> 00:03:45.220
So the size of hydrogen doesn't
seem to be so very important.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.228
Of course, protons repel one
another, and the electrons that

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:53.370
are in the bonds repel one
another;

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.740
there's electron repulsion.
 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.598
So that might be why you don't
want to have it eclipsed;

00:03:58.598 --> 00:04:01.288
that you want to rotate it a
little bit to make it staggered.

00:04:01.288 --> 00:04:03.848
But that's not easy to do in
your head,

00:04:03.848 --> 00:04:07.534
because there are also
attractions between a proton on

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:09.775
one side,
and the electron on the other,

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:12.400
and it's not clear which of
these is going to dominate.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.994
So anyhow, there's the
possibility that it has to do

00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:22.670
with the eclipsed form being
unusually destabilized -- right?

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.278
-- because of repulsions;
that could be.

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:28.069
The other point of view is that
the staggered form is unusually

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:28.620
stable.
 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.009
Now why could that be?
 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:33.343
It's that you have a
σ on one side and a

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:36.870
σ* on the other
side of these C-H bonds;

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.029
and vice-versa as well.
 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:43.389
And you can get overlap between
this HOMO and LUMO in this way.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.310
And it turns out,
surprisingly enough,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.771
that the overlap is bigger when
they're anti than when they're

00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:55.149
eclipsed.
 

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:56.577
You might think,
intuitively,

00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:59.533
that there'd be more overlap
when they're on the same side,

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.470
than when they're on the
opposite.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.911
But it doesn't take too much
work to convince yourself that

00:05:04.911 --> 00:05:08.057
the other is in fact true,
and that this is the better

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:08.769
overlap.
 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:12.242
So you'll get better HOMO/LUMO
interaction from one side to the

00:05:12.242 --> 00:05:13.764
other;
and not only for these two

00:05:13.764 --> 00:05:15.988
hydrogens,
but for the other two pairs of

00:05:15.988 --> 00:05:19.476
hydrogens as well,
if the thing is staggered,

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:24.420
so that the opposite ones are
parallel to one another.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.750
So you can get this kind of
mixing, HOMO/LUMO mixing,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.250
among σ bonds,
which is called

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.000
hyperconjugation.
 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.336
Conjugation is when normal
double bonds,

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:39.211
p orbitals overlap,
from one to the other,

00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:41.370
and you get resonance
structure.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.312
The name
"hyperconjugation"

00:05:43.312 --> 00:05:46.226
was created to talk about the
same phenomenon when it's

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:49.110
σ bonds,
rather than π bonds

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.319
that are doing the trick;
and it's usually much,

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.160
much less important.
 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.000
We'll talk about more examples
of this later on.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.663
But at any rate,
that's a very different point

00:05:57.663 --> 00:05:59.379
of view from the first one.
 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.389
Which is it,
that the eclipsed is

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.778
destabilized or that the
staggered is unusually stable?

00:06:04.778 --> 00:06:05.910
Or maybe both.
 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.442
And, in fact,
this is a little bit a

00:06:08.442 --> 00:06:12.927
scholastic argument analogous to
how many angels could dance on

00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:16.459
the head of a pin;
and you get people that debate

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.172
about this.
 

00:06:17.172 --> 00:06:17.689
Right?
 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.819
So the point is that
fundamentally there's quantum

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:24.651
mechanics that controls this,
but it doesn't say which one of

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.250
these things is what.
 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.028
It doesn't divide it that way.
 

00:06:28.028 --> 00:06:30.843
So some people say one,
some people say the other,

00:06:30.843 --> 00:06:33.370
and we'll just say maybe a
little of both.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.886
Okay, now here's a digression
on the question of what's called

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:42.637
"topicity";
which turns out to be relevant

00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:46.500
in a lot of biochemical
applications.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.232
So it's worth mentioning at
this point, this aspect of

00:06:49.232 --> 00:06:50.160
stereochemistry.
 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.223
Topicity relates to,
for example,

00:06:53.223 --> 00:06:57.339
the question:
are two protons equivalent?

00:06:57.339 --> 00:07:00.103
Now at first glance,
that's sort of a stupid

00:07:00.103 --> 00:07:00.810
question.
 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.829
Obviously a proton is a proton,
so they're equivalent.

00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:07.541
But suppose one is the H of an
OH group in ethanol,

00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.810
and the other is an H of the
methyl group.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.689
Now are they equivalent?
 

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:15.829
Well protons clearly still are
equivalent.

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:16.899
Protons are protons.
 

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.319
What's different about them?
 

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.699
What's different is their
environment.

00:07:22.699 --> 00:07:27.389
So it could be that the place
they are is different,

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.370
even though the protons
intrinsically are the same,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.350
and therefore they could have
different properties.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.060
Now, that happens to be the
case in ethanol.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:40.860
An OH group has a pKa of about
16.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.697
It's not very acidic but it's
possible to dissociate H+ and

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:45.293
leave O-.
 

00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:45.889
Right?
 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:48.519
But an H that's on a methyl
group doesn't do that.

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:50.329
It has a pKa of about 50.
 

00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:57.459
So it's 10^34th weaker as an
acid, than the OH group.

00:07:57.459 --> 00:08:01.180
So there's clearly a difference
between these two hydrogens

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.232
because of the place they're in.
 

00:08:03.232 --> 00:08:03.810
Right?
 

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.384
So that the OH on the alcohol
group exchanges readily with

00:08:08.384 --> 00:08:11.264
acidic water;
so you can put deuterium in and

00:08:11.264 --> 00:08:13.319
out of that, wash it in,
wash it out;

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:16.379
and you can't do that in the
case of methane.

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:18.810
So D+ can come in.
 

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.603
Low LUMO, attacked by the high
HOMO.

00:08:21.603 --> 00:08:22.800
You get that.
 

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.870
And then unzip it the other way.
 

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:26.899
The electrons go back on,
H+ comes off.

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.680
So you can do this exchange.
 

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.628
That doesn't happen over on the
other case because it's so hard

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.940
to get the proton off,
and the carbon has no unshared

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:38.168
pair to pick up the new proton.
 

00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:41.388
So these two protons,
the red one and the blue one,

00:08:41.388 --> 00:08:43.577
the OH and the methyl-H,
are called

00:08:43.577 --> 00:08:47.577
"heterotopic";
hetero means different,

00:08:47.577 --> 00:08:50.509
and the Greek topos
means place.

00:08:50.509 --> 00:08:52.370
So they're in a different place.
 

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.990
They have different properties
because they're in a different

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.340
place.
 

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.549
So ‘topicity' comes from
the same root obviously,

00:08:59.549 --> 00:09:02.668
and it means the placeness of a
group.

00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:04.961
It could be a hydrogen,
it could be another group,

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.674
two groups, that appear to be
the same but are in different

00:09:07.674 --> 00:09:08.190
places.
 

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.980
So this is a pretty obvious
case.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.389
But there are cases that are
less obvious.

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:17.312
So protons within the blue
group are homotopic,

00:09:17.312 --> 00:09:22.879
and the green protons are
homotopic with one another.

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:23.950
Right?
 

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.269
They're in the same kind of
place.

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:28.750
At least they're in the same
kind of place if we're

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:32.022
discussing constitution,
what they're bonded to,

00:09:32.022 --> 00:09:35.154
and what those things are
bonded to and so on.

00:09:35.154 --> 00:09:35.990
Right?
 

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:39.446
The nature and sequence of
bonds are obviously the same

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:43.158
between the two green or among
the three blue hydrogens.

00:09:43.158 --> 00:09:46.191
And both of those are different
from one another,

00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.960
and from the red hydrogen.
 

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.539
Okay, so from the point of
constitution,

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:54.509
the blue ones are homotopic,
the green ones are homotopic.

00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:57.298
The red one is its own -- right?
 

00:09:57.298 --> 00:10:01.198
-- but the green is heterotopic
with respect to the red or the

00:10:01.198 --> 00:10:02.350
blue, and so on.
 

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:06.403
So that isn't telling you much
that you wouldn't already have

00:10:06.403 --> 00:10:07.620
realized easily.
 

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.025
But if you get into
stereochemical topicity,

00:10:11.025 --> 00:10:12.769
it gets more subtle.
 

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:17.379
So let's look at stereotopic
relationships among these

00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:18.250
protons.
 

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.259
First, we said that the blue
ones were homotopic.

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.490
But are they really homotopic?
 

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.048
Let's consider those two
hydrogens.

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:30.250
Do they have the same
environment?

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.576
They're clearly the same with
respect to constitution,

00:10:33.576 --> 00:10:35.710
what they're linked to --
right?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.330
-- but are they the same
stereochemically?

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.292
Are their environments
superimposable,

00:10:42.292 --> 00:10:44.970
exactly on one another?
 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.418
Yes or no?
 

00:10:47.418 --> 00:10:53.169
So are they stereochemically
homotopic?

00:10:53.169 --> 00:10:55.710
Corey, what do you say?
 

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.059
Student:  I'd say yes.
 

00:10:59.059 --> 00:11:00.399
Prof: You say they are?
 

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.490
Student:  Yes.
 

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:05.610
Prof: If you took the
top hydrogen away,

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.706
and looked at everything else,
and then made another model

00:11:08.706 --> 00:11:10.769
where you took the bottom one
away,

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:15.429
and looked at everything else,
are those everything elses,

00:11:15.429 --> 00:11:18.820
the places, superimposable?
 

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.326
No, they're not,
because one has a hydrogen down

00:11:22.326 --> 00:11:25.010
here missing,
and the other one has a

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:27.250
hydrogen up there missing.
 

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.755
You can't superimpose those
unless you do a rotation.

00:11:31.755 --> 00:11:32.450
Right?
 

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.412
So that's a question of
conformation,

00:11:35.412 --> 00:11:37.139
of rotation,
right?

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:43.889
Okay, so those are
diastereotopic from the point of

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.471
--
that is, different places --

00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:49.460
from the point of view of
conformation,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.517
but not from the point of view
of &gt;

00:11:54.517 --> 00:11:55.711
constitution.
 

00:11:55.711 --> 00:11:56.538
Right?
 

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:58.399
Sorry, I'm getting my c's
confused.

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:02.528
It's a long run,
from the beginning of September

00:12:02.528 --> 00:12:04.110
to Thanksgiving.
 

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:08.283
You'll find that this will have
been the longest period,

00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:11.470
unrelieved period,
of your time at Yale.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.269
It gets easier after this.
 

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:16.878
Okay, so anyhow they're
diastereotopic from the point of

00:12:16.878 --> 00:12:20.288
view of conformation,
but homotopic from the point of

00:12:20.288 --> 00:12:21.929
view of constitution.
 

00:12:21.929 --> 00:12:23.980
How about those two?
 

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.740
Do they have the same
environment, those two

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:31.350
hydrogens?
 

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:40.690
Cathy, what do you say?
 

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:41.620
Student:  Yes.
 

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.649
Prof: They're
superimposable;

00:12:43.649 --> 00:12:47.375
that is, if you took the H in
front away, you'd have a certain

00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:50.250
bunch of stuff left;
that's its environment.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:55.336
And if you took the H in back
away, and looked at the rest of

00:12:55.336 --> 00:13:00.340
the stuff, are those two
remainders absolutely identical;

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.750
superimposable?
 

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:03.820
Student:  No.
 

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Prof: What is the
relationship between them?

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.700
Obviously that was sort of a
leading question.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.820
Student:  They're mirror
images.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.048
Prof: They're mirror
images.

00:13:12.048 --> 00:13:14.220
So what would you call those
two protons?

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.389
Student:  Enantiomers.
 

00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:18.769
Prof: Not enantiomers.
 

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:21.190
It's their places that are
different.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.279
Enantio-what?
 

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.600
Student:  Enantiotopic.
 

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.649
Prof: Enantiotopic.
 

00:13:24.649 --> 00:13:27.827
So the ones at the top are
enantiotopic,

00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:31.985
and the first ones we looked at
were diastereotopic.

00:13:31.985 --> 00:13:32.799
Right?
 

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:34.379
Now, do you care?
 

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:36.600
Is that going to make a
difference in chemistry?

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:42.942
I say no, and the reason I say
no is that it rotates so fast

00:13:42.942 --> 00:13:49.070
around a single bond -- we
talked about that last time;

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.700
10^10th per second.
 

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.333
And when you rotate,
you exchange one -- one takes

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:56.558
the place of another,
right?

00:13:56.558 --> 00:13:59.672
So they exchange places among
themselves faster than almost

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:02.659
anything could happen;
10^10th^( )per second.

00:14:02.659 --> 00:14:05.288
So who cares? Right?
 

00:14:05.288 --> 00:14:08.585
So in truth they're
conformationally diastereotopic,

00:14:08.585 --> 00:14:10.976
but you don't care about
conformation,

00:14:10.976 --> 00:14:13.625
in this case,
because they would rotate so

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:14.528
quickly.
 

00:14:14.528 --> 00:14:18.551
So they're not going to have
experimentally distinguishable

00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:21.809
properties, probably,
unless you can look pretty

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:22.226
quick.
 

00:14:22.226 --> 00:14:22.918
Okay?
 

00:14:22.918 --> 00:14:27.038
Now, so these distinctions are
only conformational and erased

00:14:27.038 --> 00:14:29.975
by rotation;
in 10^-12 seconds I said here.

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:30.370
Okay?
 

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.450
Yeah, that's more like it.
 

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.750
Okay, now how about the two
green ones?

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.879
What's the relationship between
them?

00:14:35.879 --> 00:14:39.360
Pat, what do you say?
 

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.668
What's the relationship?
 

00:14:40.668 --> 00:14:44.548
Student:  They're
enantiotopic.

00:14:44.548 --> 00:14:46.440
Prof: They're
enantiotopic.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.038
Now, are they enantiotopic with
respect to conformation?

00:14:51.038 --> 00:14:54.796
Can you rotate one and give it
exactly the same place as the

00:14:54.796 --> 00:14:55.559
other one?
 

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:56.360
Student:  No.
 

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.418
Prof: Why not?
 

00:14:57.418 --> 00:15:01.259
What would happen if you tried
to rotate, to put the back green

00:15:01.259 --> 00:15:03.860
one in the place of the front
green one?

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.778
Student:  It'd change
the location of the OH.

00:15:05.778 --> 00:15:07.768
Prof: It would change
the location of the OH.

00:15:07.768 --> 00:15:08.080
Right?
 

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.340
So how could you exchange their
environments?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.403
The only way,
we'd have to break a bond and

00:15:13.403 --> 00:15:15.370
put the other hydrogen someplace
else.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.620
So what kind of enantiotopic
are these?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:23.673
Is it configuration,
conformation,

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:30.259
or constitution,
that you have to change?

00:15:30.259 --> 00:15:31.460
Can you do it just by rotation?
 

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.139
Is it just conformation? No.
 

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:37.889
Do you have to change what's
bonded to what,

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:38.936
to make one?
 

00:15:38.936 --> 00:15:39.460
No.
 

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.315
So it's not -- so it's
configuration,

00:15:42.315 --> 00:15:42.950
right?
 

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.274
But the important thing is you
have to break a bond to change

00:15:46.274 --> 00:15:46.551
them.
 

00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:47.048
Right?
 

00:15:47.048 --> 00:15:49.168
So that's not going to happen
easily.

00:15:49.168 --> 00:15:52.946
So the difference between those
two -- those are also

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:55.414
enantiotopic,
but configurationally

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:56.649
enantiotopic.
 

00:15:56.649 --> 00:15:59.148
So that will last,
that distinction,

00:15:59.148 --> 00:16:02.289
in principle,
as long as the bonds endure.

00:16:02.289 --> 00:16:04.769
So there's quite a difference.
 

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:06.158
Those two could be different.
 

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:08.190
Now let's see if we can see a
case where they're different.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:13.570
Now that carbon is not a
stereogenic center.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:17.059
Why is it not a -- how do you
recognized a stereogenic center?

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:18.210
Nate?
 

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.201
Student:  By what it's
attached to -- it's bonded to

00:16:21.201 --> 00:16:22.440
four different things.
 

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.549
Prof: You guys shouldn't
sit next to each other.

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:25.918
I was talking to the other Nate.
 

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:27.240
Student:  It's got two
H's on it.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.788
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:16:27.788 --> 00:16:28.960
Student:  It's got two
hydrogens on it.

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.173
Prof: It's got two
hydrogens.

00:16:30.173 --> 00:16:31.490
It has four different things,
right?

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:32.940
And this has two of the same.
 

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.624
But it's called,
for this purpose of topicity

00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:41.344
stuff, "prochiral";
that is, it will become chiral

00:16:41.344 --> 00:16:45.379
if two of the things that are
the same become different.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.114
For example,
if one of them,

00:16:47.114 --> 00:16:49.232
instead of an H,
were a deuterium,

00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:51.610
then it would be a chiral
center.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.110
So that thing is called
prochiral.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.580
It would be chiral if the
enantiotopic atoms,

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.668
or groups -- it could be
chlorines or it could be methyl

00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:02.419
groups or whatever;
if they were made different

00:17:02.419 --> 00:17:04.259
somehow, then it would be
chiral.

00:17:04.259 --> 00:17:09.978
Now, so in ethanol,
those two green groups are

00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:14.680
enantiotopic and
configurationally.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:20.190
So now "toponymy"
-- that's names of places;

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.538
how do we name them?
 

00:17:22.538 --> 00:17:27.222
So we have things -- we have
groups that are constitutionally

00:17:27.222 --> 00:17:28.160
homotopic.
 

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.193
They have the same
constitution,

00:17:30.193 --> 00:17:32.230
connected to the same things.
 

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:35.744
Okay, so consider those,
the green hydrogen there,

00:17:35.744 --> 00:17:39.385
the light green one in front;
and I'm drawing a Newman

00:17:39.385 --> 00:17:41.038
projection also to show it.
 

00:17:41.038 --> 00:17:44.476
We have to be able to give it a
name so people will know what

00:17:44.476 --> 00:17:47.396
we're talking about,
when we're -- if this turns out

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:49.460
to be important for some reason.
 

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:53.449
Okay, so the way we do it is to
assign priority,

00:17:53.449 --> 00:17:56.080
if the hydrogens were
different.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.930
Right?
 

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.507
Then we'll be able to call it
R or S,

00:17:59.507 --> 00:17:59.920
right?
 

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.618
Because we already have a
scheme for that.

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:03.829
But the two hydrogens would
have to be different.

00:18:03.829 --> 00:18:07.230
So let's look at the priority.
 

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:10.700
OH at that carbon -- the
prochiral carbon -- is obviously

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.673
top, and the methyl,
the carbon group attached to

00:18:13.673 --> 00:18:16.255
it, is second;
but the two hydrogens come

00:18:16.255 --> 00:18:17.269
third and fourth.
 

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:19.740
But which one should be third
and which one should be fourth?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:21.358
Now here's the rule.
 

00:18:21.358 --> 00:18:28.083
You give higher priority to the
one that you're naming.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:29.078
Right?
 

00:18:29.078 --> 00:18:32.894
So if we want to name this one,
we'd give it higher priority

00:18:32.894 --> 00:18:33.930
than this one.
 

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:37.339
So this one will be three and
this one will be four.

00:18:37.339 --> 00:18:39.180
So here's the lowest priority.
 

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.862
You can run one to four,
in either direction,

00:18:41.862 --> 00:18:43.630
high to low or low to high.
 

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:45.519
You get the same sense of
handedness.

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:47.548
So let's think about this.
 

00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:52.596
Here we have -- so if I put my
left thumb coming out where this

00:18:52.596 --> 00:18:56.585
hydrogen is, the number four,
and curl my fingers,

00:18:56.585 --> 00:18:58.294
I go one, two,
three,.

00:18:58.294 --> 00:18:59.190
Okay?
 

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:03.713
So this one would be
left-handed, if it were higher

00:19:03.713 --> 00:19:04.710
priority.
 

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:05.868
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:19:05.868 --> 00:19:08.502
So we'll call that,
not S,

00:19:08.502 --> 00:19:11.548
we'll call that hydrogen
pro-S,

00:19:11.548 --> 00:19:15.170
because it will become S
-- okay?

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:18.163
-- if we make this -- for
purposes of naming,

00:19:18.163 --> 00:19:20.406
when we give it a higher
priority.

00:19:20.406 --> 00:19:21.019
Okay?
 

00:19:21.019 --> 00:19:23.666
Now, suppose we look at the
other hydrogen,

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:26.189
that I've shown in the darker
arrow here.

00:19:26.189 --> 00:19:26.818
Right?
 

00:19:26.818 --> 00:19:28.319
It obviously is going to be
pro-R,

00:19:28.319 --> 00:19:30.608
because the same thing would
run in the opposite direction.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:34.753
Okay, so pro-R and
pro-S are the name that

00:19:34.753 --> 00:19:39.200
you can give to distinguish
groups that are enantiotopic.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.220
Now, is there a reactivity
difference that we would care

00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.338
about between these groups?
 

00:19:45.338 --> 00:19:49.000
Suppose you bring up a chlorine
atom, and it can attack one or

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.558
it can attack the other.
 

00:19:50.558 --> 00:19:52.768
So suppose it attacks the one
on the left.

00:19:52.768 --> 00:19:53.200
Right?
 

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.875
Its SOMO mixes with one of the
electrons of the H,

00:19:56.875 --> 00:20:00.627
and the other electron on the H
goes on the carbon,

00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:03.480
and we break the bond and get
HCl.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.238
This is the first step,
remember, in free radical

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:07.098
substitution.
 

00:20:07.098 --> 00:20:10.259
Or we could do it with the
other one.

00:20:10.259 --> 00:20:16.119
What's the relationship between
those two pathways?

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:18.950
Can you see?
 

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.527
The pathway that happens on the
left and the pathway that

00:20:22.527 --> 00:20:25.210
happens on the right,
are they the same?

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:26.710
Student: 
&gt;.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:30.592
Prof: Well they're not
superimposable,

00:20:30.592 --> 00:20:31.210
okay?
 

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:32.869
So they're not precisely the
same.

00:20:32.869 --> 00:20:34.319
But what are they?
 

00:20:34.319 --> 00:20:36.470
Sophie?
 

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:37.660
Student:  They're mirror
images.

00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:38.940
Prof: They're mirror
images of one another.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.730
Therefore they have the same
energy.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.328
So one will be just as --
remember,

00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:47.259
we talked last time about how
fast a reaction goes has to do

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:51.123
with how high an energy you have
to go to, along that path.

00:20:51.123 --> 00:20:51.788
Right?
 

00:20:51.788 --> 00:20:53.068
And these are going to be the
same.

00:20:53.068 --> 00:20:55.230
So they'll have precisely the
same rates.

00:20:55.230 --> 00:20:58.338
So who cares? Okay?
 

00:20:58.338 --> 00:21:01.734
So attacked by a reagent like a
chlorine atom,

00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:05.584
those two versions of the
attack, are mirror images,

00:21:05.584 --> 00:21:08.980
and thus they're identical in
their rate.

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.440
So who cares?
 

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.816
But suppose that you use
something that's handed,

00:21:18.816 --> 00:21:23.885
like a right hand,
to pull it off?

00:21:23.885 --> 00:21:25.269
Okay?
 

00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:29.342
Now suppose you use the same
right hand to pull the other one

00:21:29.342 --> 00:21:29.750
off?
 

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:34.752
Those aren't mirror images of
one another anymore.

00:21:34.752 --> 00:21:35.568
Right?
 

00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:39.053
What do you call -- what's the
relationship between these two

00:21:39.053 --> 00:21:39.750
reactions?
 

00:21:41.538 --> 00:21:45.599
What would you call the
relationship between them?

00:21:45.599 --> 00:21:46.598
Angela?
 

00:21:46.598 --> 00:21:49.210
Student:  They come out
completely different.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:49.490
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:51.059
Student:  They come out
completely different.

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:54.558
So they're diastereomers.
 

00:21:54.558 --> 00:21:56.480
Prof: Right,
they're diastereomeric paths.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.788
So they're different in energy.
 

00:21:57.788 --> 00:21:59.230
So one will be faster than the
other.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:04.630
What does that tell you about
the metabolism of ethanol?

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.753
If you've got ethanol inside
you, there are things that pull

00:22:08.753 --> 00:22:12.038
the hydrogen off and make
aldehyde out of it.

00:22:12.038 --> 00:22:17.159
In fact, that's where the name
"aldehyde"

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:18.490
comes from.
 

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:24.480
Aldehyde is an alcohol that's
been dehydrogenated;

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:25.890
al-de-hyde.
 

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.828
It's interesting, isn't it?
 

00:22:27.828 --> 00:22:31.544
But anyhow, this can be --
would your body,

00:22:31.544 --> 00:22:35.522
if your body was trying to
metabolize ethanol,

00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:40.210
could it distinguish between
those two hydrogens?

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:41.589
Student:  Yes.
 

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:42.640
Prof: Why?
 

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.049
Who said yes?
 

00:22:44.049 --> 00:22:45.730
Sam?
 

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.035
Student:  Because
whatever enzyme is doing that is

00:22:48.035 --> 00:22:48.900
going to be a hand.
 

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.984
Prof: Because the enzyme
that does it is a hand,

00:22:51.984 --> 00:22:52.785
a single hand.
 

00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:53.298
Right?
 

00:22:53.298 --> 00:22:55.180
So it will be able to
distinguish between those.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:58.220
Now, can we prove that? Okay?
 

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.891
So attacks by a resolved chiral
reagent, like an enzyme,

00:23:01.891 --> 00:23:05.430
are diastereomeric and should
have different rates.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:10.500
So horse liver alcohol
dehydrogenase removes only the

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.108
pro-R hydrogen from
ethanol.

00:23:14.108 --> 00:23:20.073
Pardon me, if it removes only
the pro-R hydrogen in

00:23:20.073 --> 00:23:25.249
this deuteroethanol,
it should remove the hydrogen

00:23:25.249 --> 00:23:28.512
and never deuterium,
in the case that it's

00:23:28.512 --> 00:23:29.675
deuterated like this.
 

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:30.118
Right?
 

00:23:30.118 --> 00:23:33.798
Messed that up saying it,
but you can read it better than

00:23:33.798 --> 00:23:34.193
I can.
 

00:23:34.193 --> 00:23:34.720
Okay?
 

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.509
Now, so that would be a great
experiment.

00:23:37.509 --> 00:23:41.558
If you had this compound,
(S)-1-deuteroethanol,

00:23:41.558 --> 00:23:44.000
and you reacted it with this
enzyme,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.619
if you always pulled off the H
and left deuteroacetaldehyde,

00:23:49.619 --> 00:23:51.828
that would show it was specific.
 

00:23:51.828 --> 00:23:54.113
But if it weren't specific,
then you'd sometimes get one

00:23:54.113 --> 00:23:56.521
and sometimes the other coming
off, and you'd get different

00:23:56.521 --> 00:23:57.269
acetaldehydes.
 

00:23:57.269 --> 00:24:00.471
Some would have deuterium and
some wouldn't,

00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:01.364
left behind.
 

00:24:01.364 --> 00:24:01.960
Okay?
 

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.369
Now what's the problem in doing
this experiment?

00:24:05.369 --> 00:24:07.630
Zack?
 

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:09.345
Student:  How do you
know that deuterium's right

00:24:09.345 --> 00:24:09.598
there?
 

00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:12.296
Prof: How do you get the
compound with the deuterium on

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:14.506
only one side in the first
place, so you can do the

00:24:14.506 --> 00:24:15.170
experiment?
 

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.281
And this is where there's a
clever way of doing it.

00:24:18.281 --> 00:24:18.778
Right?
 

00:24:18.778 --> 00:24:21.648
That would be the reaction,
and you'd get only the

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:23.874
deuterium left and never
hydrogen left,

00:24:23.874 --> 00:24:25.278
if it were specific.
 

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:27.878
So that's a good test,
but where do you get the

00:24:27.878 --> 00:24:29.009
starting material?
 

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:34.443
Now actually,
the alcohol dehydrogenase is a

00:24:34.443 --> 00:24:36.720
catalyst, right?
 

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.236
And a catalyst lowers the
energy of the barrier you have

00:24:40.236 --> 00:24:43.640
to go through to go across;
lowers the barrier.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:48.108
But that means it lowers the
barrier in either direction;

00:24:48.108 --> 00:24:51.083
because you can go either
direction across this.

00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:51.588
Right?
 

00:24:51.588 --> 00:24:56.250
So that means that you can --
this is an oxidation;

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.220
removing hydrogen is an
oxidation.

00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:01.009
But you could also do the
reverse reaction;

00:25:01.009 --> 00:25:01.940
a reduction.
 

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:05.118
That is, you could start with
this.

00:25:05.118 --> 00:25:09.788
So what really does the
oxidation -- LAD is a catalyst

00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:13.489
-- what does it is this NAD+
becoming NADH,

00:25:13.489 --> 00:25:14.809
taking H- away.
 

00:25:14.809 --> 00:25:15.778
Right?
 

00:25:15.778 --> 00:25:18.509
So if you ran this reaction
backwards,

00:25:18.509 --> 00:25:20.528
and started with a deuterium
there,

00:25:20.528 --> 00:25:23.943
then if the thing were
specific, you'd put hydrogen

00:25:23.943 --> 00:25:26.298
only there,
when you run it backwards;

00:25:26.298 --> 00:25:31.741
if it's specific taking it off,
it'll be specific putting it

00:25:31.741 --> 00:25:32.019
on.
 

00:25:32.019 --> 00:25:32.848
Right?
 

00:25:32.848 --> 00:25:37.170
Now how would you know if it's
specific, putting it on?

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.088
How would you know if it did
that?

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:47.650
How would you know whether,
when it does this reaction,

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.670
it scrambles and puts it in
both positions,

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:53.380
and then when you run it
backwards it scrambles and takes

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.490
it off both positions,
sometimes one,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.088
sometimes the other;
or whether it's specific going

00:25:59.088 --> 00:26:01.190
on and specific coming off?
 

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:04.960
Lucas, you got an idea?
 

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:07.278
Student:  You can pull
it off and check optical

00:26:07.278 --> 00:26:07.759
activity.
 

00:26:07.759 --> 00:26:09.698
Prof: Ah,
if you could measure the

00:26:09.698 --> 00:26:12.509
optical activity of this stuff,
that would be a good way of

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:13.140
doing it.
 

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:15.352
But it doesn't have very much
optical activity,

00:26:15.352 --> 00:26:18.190
if the only difference is
between deuterium and hydrogen;

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:19.519
not very much.
 

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:21.673
Student:  This is just
kind of guess,

00:26:21.673 --> 00:26:24.376
but if they did it to both
things, wouldn't you get one

00:26:24.376 --> 00:26:26.430
with both and then one with only
one?

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:29.948
And then if it only went to one
side, you'd only get one with

00:26:29.948 --> 00:26:30.298
one.
 

00:26:30.298 --> 00:26:33.519
Prof: I think you said
it.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.618
Student:  Probably not
right.

00:26:34.618 --> 00:26:36.300
Prof: But I don't know
that everyone understood what

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:36.619
you said.
 

00:26:36.619 --> 00:26:38.980
The idea is do both.
 

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:45.630
Put on, and then take that
product and take it off again.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.483
If it's specific going on,
and specific going off,

00:26:48.483 --> 00:26:51.979
when you go through the whole
cycle you'll get back where you

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:52.970
started from.
 

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:56.557
But if it mixes up going on and
coming off, then sometimes it

00:26:56.557 --> 00:27:00.144
will put it on the wrong place,
sometimes it will take it off

00:27:00.144 --> 00:27:01.338
the wrong place.
 

00:27:01.338 --> 00:27:04.366
And when you come back,
sometimes you'll have H and

00:27:04.366 --> 00:27:07.394
sometimes you'll have D,
in that starting material.

00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:08.000
Right?
 

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.539
So you go both ways and see.
 

00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:11.220
And that works, right?
 

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:15.172
By starting with the same
catalyst and excess deuteride,

00:27:15.172 --> 00:27:17.113
you do that,
to go that way.

00:27:17.113 --> 00:27:17.759
Okay?
 

00:27:17.759 --> 00:27:20.557
So if you do a full cycle,
like that, then you come back

00:27:20.557 --> 00:27:23.509
-- pardon me -- you come back
exactly where you started.

00:27:23.509 --> 00:27:26.358
But, this proves the
specificity;

00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:28.921
but it doesn't say which one,
it doesn't say whether it was

00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:30.288
pro-R or pro-S.
 

00:27:30.288 --> 00:27:33.396
For that you need to do other
kinds of experiments that we

00:27:33.396 --> 00:27:35.032
don't have time to talk about.
 

00:27:35.032 --> 00:27:35.470
Okay?
 

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.190
So that's really a neat
experiment,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.660
that shows that topicity makes
a difference,

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.190
and that enzymes discriminate
between stereotopic,

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.250
enantiotopic groups, or atoms.
 

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:52.318
Okay, next subject is Baeyer
Strain Theory,

00:27:52.318 --> 00:27:55.130
which was proposed in 1885.
 

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:58.746
So that's ten years after van't
Hoff.

00:27:58.746 --> 00:27:59.450
Okay?
 

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.411
So here's the group in Munich,
in 1893, and here,

00:28:03.411 --> 00:28:06.876
front and center,
is the boss of the group,

00:28:06.876 --> 00:28:08.608
Adolf von Baeyer.
 

00:28:08.608 --> 00:28:11.208
And this picture hangs in the
hallway out there,

00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:12.480
the original picture.
 

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.430
You can look at it.
 

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:18.602
And the reason it does is that
this guy here is Henry Lord

00:28:18.602 --> 00:28:19.509
Wheeler.
 

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:20.880
Did you ever see his name?
 

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:27.480
Student:
&gt;.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.440
Prof: See how observant
you are.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.390
Student: 
&gt;.

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:33.869
Prof: Pardon?
 

00:28:33.869 --> 00:28:35.338
Lexy, did you -- Pat?
 

00:28:35.338 --> 00:28:37.279
Student:  Is it down in
the foyer to this building?

00:28:37.279 --> 00:28:38.464
Prof: Yeah,
when you come in,

00:28:38.464 --> 00:28:39.990
there are these names carved on
the walls,

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.750
which were the people who were,
in the nineteenth,

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.519
early-twentieth century,
professors.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:47.397
So he was the first organic
chemist at Yale,

00:28:47.397 --> 00:28:50.811
and he went to Munich,
where a lot of people went to

00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:53.490
learn organic chemistry from
Baeyer.

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:56.594
Baeyer, remember,
was the guy who fiddled with

00:28:56.594 --> 00:28:59.214
the bread rolls,
together with Fischer,

00:28:59.214 --> 00:29:00.940
to make these models.
 

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:04.155
He was also the guy that did
experiments on arsenic in

00:29:04.155 --> 00:29:07.068
Kekulé's kitchen when he
was a student.

00:29:07.068 --> 00:29:11.108
So Baeyer was the leading
organic chemist of the time.

00:29:11.108 --> 00:29:14.990
Now, in 1885 he -- that's
earlier than this picture;

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.003
that picture was 1893,
when Henry Lord Wheeler was

00:29:19.003 --> 00:29:19.660
there.
 

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:24.428
Notice that he died at what;
at thirty-seven,

00:29:24.428 --> 00:29:26.410
the age of thirty-seven.
 

00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:30.759
I don't know what he died of,
in 1911.

00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:32.308
So he wasn't a professor very
long.

00:29:32.308 --> 00:29:36.999
Okay, so this paper,
eight years earlier,

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:41.220
was about polyacetylene
compounds;

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.940
so a bunch of triple bonds
arranged in a row.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.910
We've talked about double bonds
in a row;

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:47.848
you can have triple bonds in a
row too.

00:29:47.848 --> 00:29:51.000
But you don't have them for
very long because,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.430
as Baeyer reported in this
paper, they explode.

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.104
He had a collaborator named
Dr. Homolka,

00:29:57.104 --> 00:30:01.630
who he thanks for doing some of
the experiments in this paper.

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:06.278
Dr. Homolka does not appear
in the 1893 picture.

00:30:06.278 --> 00:30:07.266
&gt;
 

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:09.362
I suspect that he just
graduated, got his degree and

00:30:09.362 --> 00:30:11.130
went to be gainfully employed
someplace.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.940
But who knows?
 

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:14.700
Anyhow, polyacetylenes are
explosive.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.528
And this got Baeyer thinking,
why should just a regular old

00:30:18.528 --> 00:30:20.308
hydrocarbon be explosive?
 

00:30:20.308 --> 00:30:25.757
So he branched out in this
paper, and the very first topic

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:30.536
was "The Theory of Ring
Closure and the Double

00:30:30.536 --> 00:30:31.970
Bond."
 

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.890
Now that seems a funny thing to
talk about;

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.907
when you're talking about
triple bonds,

00:30:35.907 --> 00:30:38.990
to talk about making rings,
and talk about double bonds.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.778
But what he says is:
"Ring closure"

00:30:42.778 --> 00:30:46.048
which was a popular synthetic
goal,

00:30:46.048 --> 00:30:48.630
at that time,
to make new kinds of compounds,

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.769
was to try to make rings.
 

00:30:49.769 --> 00:30:51.825
They could make six-membered
rings, they could make

00:30:51.825 --> 00:30:52.730
five-membered rings.
 

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:56.669
In Bayer's lab they actually
made four-membered rings and

00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:58.779
three-membered rings,
right?

00:30:58.779 --> 00:31:00.650
Although that was quite a chore.
 

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.567
Okay, so "Ring closure is
apparently the only phenomenon

00:31:04.567 --> 00:31:08.288
that can supply information
about the arrangement of atoms

00:31:08.288 --> 00:31:09.528
in space."
 

00:31:09.528 --> 00:31:11.730
This is ten years after van't
Hoff.

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:15.232
"Since a chain of five or
six members can be closed

00:31:15.232 --> 00:31:17.713
easily,
while one of more or fewer

00:31:17.713 --> 00:31:20.338
members is difficult or
impossible,

00:31:20.338 --> 00:31:23.578
spatial factors are apparently
involved."

00:31:23.578 --> 00:31:25.902
And you know,
we already talked about a case

00:31:25.902 --> 00:31:28.872
like this, where you tell
something about arrangement in

00:31:28.872 --> 00:31:31.140
space from the ability to form a
ring.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:32.539
Do you remember what that is?
 

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:34.400
Anybody? Yeah?
 

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.500
Student:  Synthesis of
mesitylene.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.200
Prof: Can't hear very
well.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.170
Student:  Synthesis of
mesitylene.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.035
Prof: Oh,
the synthesis of mesitylene

00:31:40.035 --> 00:31:40.730
formed a ring.
 

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:44.347
But that doesn't -- so he used
that to say where the methyl

00:31:44.347 --> 00:31:45.970
groups were on the ring.
 

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.140
And that's actually a good
example, but it's not the one I

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.940
was thinking about.
 

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.670
Student: Cyclopropane.
 

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.319
Student:  Cyclopropane?
 

00:31:53.319 --> 00:31:55.619
Prof: Dichloropropane?
 

00:31:55.619 --> 00:31:56.538
Student:  No.
 

00:31:56.538 --> 00:31:57.660
Prof: Is that what you
said?

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.597
Student:  No,
I said cyclopropane with the

00:31:59.597 --> 00:32:00.730
&gt;.
 

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.608
Prof: It's not
cyclopropane that I had in mind;

00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:05.288
although that was one of the
compounds that was synthesized

00:32:05.288 --> 00:32:08.200
in Baeyer's lab for the first
time, and found to be reactive.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.798
But there was another occasion.
 

00:32:10.798 --> 00:32:13.380
Remember maleic and fumaric
acid;

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.420
one was cis and one was
trans?

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:19.837
And the one that was cis
could lose water to form a ring.

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:20.400
Right?
 

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.920
So that was what he's referring
to here.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.090
Okay, so then he goes on to
say: "The previously --

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.608
" (So there's a website you
can click on to see this.)

00:32:29.608 --> 00:32:32.713
"The previously proposed
general rules on the nature of

00:32:32.713 --> 00:32:35.082
carbon atoms are the following:
I.***Carbon is

00:32:35.082 --> 00:32:36.240
tetravalent."
 

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.380
Who did that?
 

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.068
Student:  Couper and
Kekulé.

00:32:39.068 --> 00:32:41.683
Prof: Couper and
Kekulé,

00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:42.250
right?
 

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:46.384
"The four valences are
equivalent, shown by the fact

00:32:46.384 --> 00:32:49.559
there's only one
monosubstitution product of

00:32:49.559 --> 00:32:50.890
methane."
 

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:52.029
(We've talked about that.)
 

00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.538
"III.
 

00:32:52.538 --> 00:32:55.646
The valences are equivalently
arranged in space to the corners

00:32:55.646 --> 00:32:57.380
of a regular tetrahedron."
 

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.759
Who says that carbon is
tetrahedral?

00:32:59.759 --> 00:33:00.799
Student:  van't Hoff.
 

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:01.690
Prof: van't Hoff.
 

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.792
Also, incidentally,
there was a Frenchman who did

00:33:04.792 --> 00:33:06.798
it simultaneously,
called LeBel.

00:33:06.798 --> 00:33:07.380
Okay?
 

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:07.917
"IV.
 

00:33:07.917 --> 00:33:11.211
The atoms or groups attached to
the four valences cannot

00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:12.710
exchange places."
 

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:16.468
(So you can't -- you have to
break bonds to make new isomers,

00:33:16.468 --> 00:33:16.970
right?
 

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:18.990
So if you get them one way,
they'll stay.)

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.945
"The evidence is that
there are two tetrasubstitution

00:33:21.945 --> 00:33:23.710
products, abcd of methane."
 

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:28.442
(So van't Hoff and LeBel's
rule, that you can have

00:33:28.442 --> 00:33:32.788
configurational enantiomers,
we would say.)

00:33:32.788 --> 00:33:33.256
"V.
 

00:33:33.256 --> 00:33:35.882
Carbon atoms can bond to one
another with one,

00:33:35.882 --> 00:33:37.750
two, or three valences."
 

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:39.750
(That is, you have single,
double, triple bonds.)

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:40.666
"VI.
 

00:33:40.666 --> 00:33:46.578
The compounds can form either
open chains or rings."

00:33:46.578 --> 00:33:48.279
(That's what he's talking about
here.)

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:52.385
"I should like to add the
following, to these generally

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:53.568
accepted rules.
 

00:33:53.568 --> 00:33:57.101
So he's adding a new property,
to the models,

00:33:57.101 --> 00:34:01.365
the same way van't Hoff did;
van't Hoff added arrangement in

00:34:01.365 --> 00:34:04.180
space, to the models that people
already drew.

00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.009
What Baeyer is adding is VII.)
 

00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:09.514
"The four valences of the
carbon atom point to the

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.436
directions connecting the center
of the sphere to the corners of

00:34:12.436 --> 00:34:13.550
a tetrahedron."
 

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:17.440
(That's what van't Hoff also
said -- already said.)

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.442
"But forming an angle of
109°28' with one

00:34:21.442 --> 00:34:22.750
another."
 

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:25.280
(That's very quantitative and
precise.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.112
That's the angle between the
center and two vertices in a

00:34:30.112 --> 00:34:32.702
geometric regular tetrahedron.
 

00:34:32.702 --> 00:34:33.480
Okay?)
 

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.614
But then this is what's
interesting: "The direction

00:34:36.614 --> 00:34:38.951
of attachment can undergo
alteration"

00:34:38.951 --> 00:34:41.972
(It doesn't have to be exactly
that angle) "but a

00:34:41.972 --> 00:34:45.534
strain is generated,
increasing with the size of the

00:34:45.534 --> 00:34:46.480
deflection."
 

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.105
So if you have an angle other
than 109°28',

00:34:50.105 --> 00:34:55.150
then there's going to be higher
energy associated with strain;

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:59.139
or, what he's actually talking
about is not higher energy,

00:34:59.139 --> 00:35:00.329
but reactivity.
 

00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:05.798
Okay, so he drew this picture,
showing how much the angles are

00:35:05.798 --> 00:35:08.309
distorted from 109.5°.
 

00:35:08.309 --> 00:35:12.505
So if you consider ethylene to
be a two-membered ring,

00:35:12.505 --> 00:35:16.384
with two bent bonds,
the angle the bonds are going

00:35:16.384 --> 00:35:19.630
at is where it should be
tetrahedral;

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:21.190
and in fact they're collinear.
 

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:26.221
That distortion of each bond is
54°44', and so on,

00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:30.019
for three, four;
five is perfect, right?

00:35:30.019 --> 00:35:32.179
It only deviates by 44'.
 

00:35:32.179 --> 00:35:36.324
But the six-membered ring is
stretched a little bit the other

00:35:36.324 --> 00:35:36.739
way.
 

00:35:36.739 --> 00:35:39.750
It has to go out,
rather than sharper.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.320
Okay.
 

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:42.072
So he says:
"Dimethylene…"

00:35:42.072 --> 00:35:43.309
--
that's ethylene,

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:46.182
the first one --
"…is indeed the

00:35:46.182 --> 00:35:49.552
weakest ring,
which can be opened by HBr,

00:35:49.552 --> 00:35:52.159
bromine,
or even iodine."

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:56.324
(We talked about bromine,
or chlorine attacking the

00:35:56.324 --> 00:35:57.989
ethylene already.)
 

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.226
"Trimethyle
ne…"

00:36:00.226 --> 00:36:04.561
(cyclopropane) "…is
broken only by hydrogen bromide

00:36:04.561 --> 00:36:06.590
but not by bromine."
 

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:08.840
(So it's not as reactive as the
two-membered ring.)

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.527
"Finally,
tetramethylene and

00:36:10.527 --> 00:36:13.639
hexamethylene are difficult or
impossible to break."

00:36:13.639 --> 00:36:15.079
They're pretty stable.
 

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:18.905
So this strain causes
reactivity, if the bond angles

00:36:18.905 --> 00:36:20.030
aren't right.
 

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:22.050
So he's becoming more
quantitative;

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:26.550
unusually quantitative for an
organic chemist at this period.

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:29.327
Remember, the physical chemists
-- this is just at the period

00:36:29.327 --> 00:36:31.690
when physical chemistry is
coming into its own --

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.690
and they were the ones who did
heat and energy and so on.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.507
All Baeyer is talking about is
whether things will react or

00:36:38.507 --> 00:36:38.800
not.
 

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.639
But he's using geometric
precision.

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:43.429
Okay?
 

00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:47.739
So the question is,
are six-membered rings,

00:36:47.739 --> 00:36:51.637
like this, cyclohexane,
they should be,

00:36:51.637 --> 00:36:55.947
according to Baeyer,
a little bit strained.

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.179
Right?
 

00:36:57.179 --> 00:37:00.942
Because the angles should be --
you'd think the angles would be

00:37:00.942 --> 00:37:02.518
120° instead of 109.
 

00:37:02.518 --> 00:37:04.010
So they're opened up a little
bit too much.

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:08.170
But Sachse, a young
privatdocent -- that is,

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.065
essentially,
between a graduate student and

00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:15.889
a professor --
in 1890 published a paper that

00:37:15.889 --> 00:37:19.059
had this very funny picture,
A,B,C,D,E,F,

00:37:19.059 --> 00:37:20.510
up on the top there.
 

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:24.389
And people didn't understand
what it was.

00:37:24.389 --> 00:37:27.635
But what it is,
is a thing that if you trace it

00:37:27.635 --> 00:37:31.797
on cardboard and fold along the
diagonals, you get this blue

00:37:31.797 --> 00:37:34.512
thing -- right?;
if you fold it along the

00:37:34.512 --> 00:37:36.521
diagonals and paste the ends
together.

00:37:36.521 --> 00:37:37.010
Right?
 

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:41.896
And then if you paste van't
Hoff tetrahedra on it,

00:37:41.896 --> 00:37:43.989
you get this thing.
 

00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:47.960
And you'll see that this is
just like this.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.980
Everybody see that?
 

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:56.266
It's using -- but this is a
base on which to build such

00:37:56.266 --> 00:38:01.360
tetrahedral carbons,
so as to make this structure.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:05.978
And what's interesting about it
is that these angles are the

00:38:05.978 --> 00:38:08.014
normal tetrahedral angles.
 

00:38:08.014 --> 00:38:08.719
Right?
 

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:11.090
They're not strained. Right?
 

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:14.159
Why are they not 120°?
 

00:38:14.159 --> 00:38:18.641
Because the ring isn't flat,
it's puckered.

00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:19.389
Okay?
 

00:38:19.389 --> 00:38:21.730
So that's what Sachse said.
 

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:25.244
And he gave people this thing
so they could make their own

00:38:25.244 --> 00:38:26.355
models and see it.
 

00:38:26.355 --> 00:38:26.909
Right?
 

00:38:26.909 --> 00:38:32.344
And he gave the directions for
building this more complicated

00:38:32.344 --> 00:38:37.146
base, where you put it on and
have a different form of

00:38:37.146 --> 00:38:38.233
cyclohexane.
 

00:38:38.233 --> 00:38:39.139
Okay?
 

00:38:39.139 --> 00:38:52.960
And that one,
as you see, looks like this.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.320
Okay?
 

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:59.279
So in 1890 he knew exactly the
score that we would know -- that

00:38:59.279 --> 00:39:02.090
we would get with our own models
nowadays.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.809
Now, when this was abstracted
in the journal that published

00:39:05.809 --> 00:39:09.271
abstracts of all chemical
literature so people could go

00:39:09.271 --> 00:39:12.800
there and find out what was
going on in chemistry,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.833
Julius Wagner,
who abstracted it,

00:39:14.833 --> 00:39:18.519
said: "It is not possible
to write an abstract of this

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:20.902
paper,
especially since the author's

00:39:20.902 --> 00:39:23.280
explanations are hardly
understandable,

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.210
without models."
 

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.143
Now, one conclusion from that
should be therefore go and build

00:39:27.143 --> 00:39:29.643
his models and look at them,
and you'll see what he's

00:39:29.643 --> 00:39:30.510
talking about.
 

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:33.291
But that's not what Wagner
said, and it's not what people

00:39:33.291 --> 00:39:33.590
did.
 

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.018
He said, "Forget that,
it's nonsense"

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:36.599
-- right?
 

00:39:36.599 --> 00:39:39.880
-- "you can't understand
it." Okay.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.570
So Baeyer wasn't happy with
this, disputing his theory.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.523
So he wrote,
in the same year,

00:39:47.523 --> 00:39:50.643
1890 --
Sachse wasn't too smart about

00:39:50.643 --> 00:39:56.016
this because he published that
paper just as they were having a

00:39:56.016 --> 00:40:00.523
big celebration of Baeyer's
contributions to aromatic

00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:03.557
chemistry in Berlin;
there was this big,

00:40:03.557 --> 00:40:06.347
fabulous dinner with eighteen
courses, or something like that,

00:40:06.347 --> 00:40:08.679
and all -- everybody,
chemists from all over Germany

00:40:08.679 --> 00:40:09.320
gathered.
 

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.170
And Sachse, this nobody,
publishes a paper and says

00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:13.710
Baeyer's theory is wrong.
 

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.340
Bad timing.
 

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:19.010
So Baeyer published a response
quickly.

00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:22.016
He said: "A further
proposal is that the atoms in

00:40:22.016 --> 00:40:24.739
hexamethylene…"
(six-CH_2 groups,

00:40:24.739 --> 00:40:27.342
cyclohexane) "…are
arranged as in Kekulé's

00:40:27.342 --> 00:40:27.949
model."
 

00:40:27.949 --> 00:40:31.768
(Now Kekulé's model,
remember, by this time was in

00:40:31.768 --> 00:40:35.463
fact a tetrahedron;
which is what Sachse showed how

00:40:35.463 --> 00:40:36.632
you could do it.
 

00:40:36.632 --> 00:40:37.289
Right?)
 

00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:40.211
But he says,
"…as in

00:40:40.211 --> 00:40:43.876
Kekulé's model,
and that the arrangement of the

00:40:43.876 --> 00:40:46.027
atoms in space is one with
minimum distortion of the

00:40:46.027 --> 00:40:47.210
valence directions."
 

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:48.780
(That sounds like Sachse.)
 

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.039
But what he says is:
"Thus, the six carbon

00:40:52.039 --> 00:40:54.590
atoms must lie on one
plane."

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.159
(It's got to be planar.)
 

00:40:56.159 --> 00:40:59.231
"and six hydrogen atoms
lie in equidistant parallel

00:40:59.231 --> 00:41:00.070
planes."
 

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:01.389
(Six above, six below.
 

00:41:01.389 --> 00:41:04.420
All the CH_2s are just like
this around the ring.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:04.989
Right?)
 

00:41:04.989 --> 00:41:06.896
"Further,
each of the twelve hydrogen

00:41:06.896 --> 00:41:09.409
atoms must have the same
position relative to the other

00:41:09.409 --> 00:41:10.340
seventeen."
 

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:13.161
(That is, they're homotopic;
you can rotate it,

00:41:13.161 --> 00:41:14.679
if the plane is flat.
 

00:41:14.679 --> 00:41:16.369
Now how can he say this?
 

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:19.972
It's not really like
Kekulé's model.

00:41:19.972 --> 00:41:20.659
Okay?)
 

00:41:20.659 --> 00:41:24.630
"The experimental test of
the correctness of this

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:29.592
assumption is relatively easy;
for example sufficient evidence

00:41:29.592 --> 00:41:34.969
is that there is a single isomer
of hexahydrobenzoic acid."

00:41:34.969 --> 00:41:38.949
That this, only one cyclohexane
carboxylic acid.

00:41:38.949 --> 00:41:43.836
That is, if you had this,
and put a COOH group here,

00:41:43.836 --> 00:41:48.724
or a COOH group here,
what would be the relationship

00:41:48.724 --> 00:41:50.449
between those?
 

00:41:50.449 --> 00:41:55.257
This place and this place,
what would you call -- are they

00:41:55.257 --> 00:41:56.268
homotopic?
 

00:41:56.268 --> 00:42:03.000
Are they enantiotopic,
this place and this place?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.079
Mirror images?
 

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:06.519
No, they're just different.
 

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:09.070
They're diastereotopic, right?
 

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:11.349
Now, but you could do a neat
trick.

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:12.710
So that's what he says.
 

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:16.793
If it were like Sachse,
then you'd have two isomers of

00:42:16.793 --> 00:42:19.260
a monosubstituted cyclohexane.
 

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.219
But what he didn't take into
account was this.

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:24.150
This one is sticking up like
that.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.230
Watch this.
 

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:27.429
Notice the black one is
sticking out,

00:42:27.429 --> 00:42:30.242
down at an angle,
and the white one is sticking

00:42:30.242 --> 00:42:31.219
straight up.
 

00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:32.139
But watch this.
 

00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:38.989
Now this one's down at an angle
and the black one's straight up.

00:42:38.989 --> 00:42:43.480
Did I break any bonds?
 

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.619
What did I do?
 

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:45.969
Student:  Rotated.
 

00:42:45.969 --> 00:42:47.920
Prof: I just rotated
about bonds.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:55.329
They're conformational;
conformationally diastereotopic.

00:42:55.329 --> 00:42:56.630
Not configurationally.
 

00:42:56.630 --> 00:43:00.096
So they're different but they
can interconvert easily.

00:43:00.096 --> 00:43:00.619
Right?
 

00:43:00.619 --> 00:43:04.391
So Baeyer says he's right
because there's only one isomer,

00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:07.900
so you have to regard it as
flat, even if it isn't;

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:09.449
although he didn't say that.
 

00:43:09.449 --> 00:43:12.521
"Meanwhile,
as long as our knowledge in the

00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:16.016
field is so incomplete,
we must be satisfied that the

00:43:16.016 --> 00:43:18.369
above assumption is the most
likely,

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:23.670
and no known fact contradicts
it." Okay?

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:26.550
Now, Sachse didn't take this
lying down either.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:30.722
So he publishes a forty-one
page paper in Zeitschrift

00:43:30.722 --> 00:43:33.530
für Physikalische
Chemie,

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.210
which is published by Ostwald,
who hates Baeyer,

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:39.324
and vice-versa;
the physical chemists and the

00:43:39.324 --> 00:43:41.190
organic chemists didn't get
along.

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:44.570
So he publishes a paper in this
other one where he gives all

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.179
this trigonometry to explain
what he means by this structure.

00:43:48.179 --> 00:43:52.320
Is this something calculated to
appeal to organic chemists?

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:57.380
Not very likely. Okay?
 

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.731
So this is edited by Ostwald,
who didn't even believe in

00:44:00.731 --> 00:44:02.548
atoms,
remember, and wrote

00:44:02.548 --> 00:44:05.289
disparagingly of his successor
in Riga,

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:08.400
who had been an organic
chemist: "Scientifically,

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:11.300
he had been brought up in the
narrow circle of contemporary

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.974
organic chemistry,
and to him the arrangement in

00:44:13.974 --> 00:44:17.224
space of the atoms of organic
compounds was the foremost of

00:44:17.224 --> 00:44:19.130
all conceivable problems."
 

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:22.530
That wasn't what Ostwald
thought was the best problem.

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.030
So Sachse published again.
 

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:27.309
Nobody responded to that first
one, so he publishes again,

00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:29.670
the next year,
thirty-four pages again.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:33.336
And here he gives more formulas;
again, things that didn't

00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:36.416
appeal at all to anybody who was
actually interested in the

00:44:36.416 --> 00:44:38.170
arrangement of atoms in space.
 

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:42.425
And then he died at the age of
thirty-one, in that year,

00:44:42.425 --> 00:44:46.835
and that was the end of Sachse,
and the end of his theory.

00:44:46.835 --> 00:44:47.610
Right?
 

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:51.253
And Baeyer wrote in 1905 -- so
twelve years later:

00:44:51.253 --> 00:44:55.641
"Sachse disagreed with my
opinion that larger rings are

00:44:55.641 --> 00:44:56.460
planar.
 

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.248
He is certainly right from a
mathematical point of

00:44:59.248 --> 00:45:01.726
view;"
(Although I sort of doubt that

00:45:01.726 --> 00:45:04.621
Baeyer went through every line
of this to check it.

00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:05.199
Right?)
 

00:45:05.199 --> 00:45:07.657
"Yet, in reality,
strangely enough,

00:45:07.657 --> 00:45:09.800
my theory appears to be
correct.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.815
The reason is not clear."
 

00:45:12.815 --> 00:45:13.420
Okay?
 

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:16.199
So that was -- remember,
Sachse was 1890.

00:45:16.199 --> 00:45:23.103
So what important lesson should
we take from the tale of poor

00:45:23.103 --> 00:45:24.139
Sachse?
 

00:45:24.139 --> 00:45:26.650
Do you want me to give you that
as a problem to think about over

00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:27.250
Thanksgiving?
 

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.250
Fine.
 

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.293
Okay, so this,
remember is what Sachse wrote,

00:45:32.293 --> 00:45:34.440
and he drew models like this.
 

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.750
And -- I'll just conclude the
punch line here --

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.356
in 1913 Bragg and Bragg
determined the diamond

00:45:41.356 --> 00:45:44.003
structure,
by X-ray diffraction of a

00:45:44.003 --> 00:45:45.286
crystalline diamond.
 

00:45:45.286 --> 00:45:45.800
Right?
 

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:51.478
And five years later,
Ernst Mohr published a diagram

00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:56.380
he drew of -- from that diamond
structure.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:59.630
Braggs didn't draw the
structure, but Mohr did five

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.539
years later.
 

00:46:00.539 --> 00:46:04.420
And here's what he drew,
and that is exactly what Sachse

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:04.844
meant.
 

00:46:04.844 --> 00:46:05.480
Right?
 

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.068
So the arrangement of the
carbons in a six-membered ring,

00:46:09.068 --> 00:46:11.760
in diamond, is exactly what
Sachse said;

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.750
but he got nothing for it.
 

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:16.130
Okay, have a good Thanksgiving.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.590
Prof: Let's get going
with John Stuart Mill.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.650
Let me just one more time to
say John Stuart Mill is

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.030
formidably influential,
very influential on our days.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.290
He's the ultimate of liberalism.
 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.921
And in some ways,
among all the authors we will

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:25.812
be reading this semester,
he's the most consistent,

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:30.290
the clearest one and the most
consistent of them all.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.940
He draws the line to the
logical conclusions,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.683
no matter what it is.
 

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:36.430
Right?
 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.650
And taking his point of
departure from Adam Smith--

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.870
Locke, Adam Smith and then
Bentham--

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.314
he pushes the line of
utilitarianism to its most

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:55.842
logical conclusions,
and he's extremely influential

00:00:55.842 --> 00:00:59.370
on what we call now neoclassical
economics,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.602
and he was exactly the person,
who made many people who were

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:08.860
liberals and Democrats in the
1960s and '70s,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.031
to change and create what they
called neo-conservativism or

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:16.989
neo-liberalism and went over to
the Republican Party.

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:19.080
It was an important dividing
line.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.769
Mill's staunch insistence on
individual liberty,

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:32.946
and what follows from this
staunch insistence for the role

00:01:32.946 --> 00:01:39.989
of the state and how far states
can interfere with individuals.

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:43.116
That was really,
I think, the dividing line in

00:01:43.116 --> 00:01:46.730
which many people who were on
the political left,

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.459
center left,
or occasionally far left,

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.998
by the late 1960s,
early '70s, seeing stuff like

00:01:54.998 --> 00:01:58.688
the affirmative action,
the War on Poverty,

00:01:58.688 --> 00:02:00.299
they changed their lines.
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.081
They said, "Look,
the Democratic Party,

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.670
liberalism, really betrays
liberalism.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.189
That's not liberalism.
 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.520
Read John Stuart Mill.
 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.556
That's when you will know what
real liberalism is."

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:15.288
Right?
 

00:02:15.288 --> 00:02:20.389
Anyway, so I think this is why
his message is very much alive.

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:25.990
And I'm sure that this
classroom is divided by people.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.628
Some people subscribe to John
Stuart Mill's liberalism.

00:02:32.628 --> 00:02:36.889
Others probably do think that
he emphasizes too much

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:41.485
individual liberties and there
is much more of a role to

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.580
implement the general good by
the government.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.397
Okay, I mean,
I think we left it right here

00:02:49.397 --> 00:02:50.490
last week.
 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.169
These are the main themes of
his book on utilitarianism,

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:58.970
the way how he departs from
Bentham--

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.875
a very important change that
he's beginning to emphasize

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:07.710
there are higher happinesses we
can seek.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.342
It is not simply quantity but
quality of happiness is what we

00:03:13.342 --> 00:03:14.000
seek.
 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.449
A very important contribution,
I think,

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.967
and this is an idea which is
only touched upon by Adam Smith

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:23.800
but really not properly
developed,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.960
and certainly completely
missing in Bentham.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.923
It is really Mill's
contribution which is very

00:03:29.923 --> 00:03:33.622
important for contemporary
economic theory,

00:03:33.622 --> 00:03:36.000
neoclassical economics.
 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.604
They call this preferences,
that we have preferences,

00:03:39.604 --> 00:03:43.485
and therefore individuals will
attach different values to

00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:45.150
different utilities.
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.150
And this really comes from the
work of John Stuart Mill,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.878
when he makes this distinction
between legality and justice,

00:03:55.878 --> 00:04:01.968
and what is legal is not
necessarily just,

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:05.800
and what is just is necessarily
approved by laws.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.151
And then justice and
expediency: what is expedient is

00:04:09.151 --> 00:04:13.430
not necessarily just,
and well just may have its cost

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.216
and may not be the fastest way
to get there.

00:04:17.216 --> 00:04:18.009
Right?
 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:23.156
Okay, so let's labor our way
through of this,

00:04:23.156 --> 00:04:28.069
and leave time to look at the
questions.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:33.610
Well the idea is that we are
human beings and therefore we

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.958
have a capacity to have higher
appetites than the animal

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.930
appetites.
 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.000
Right?
 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.220
So we have imagination,
what animals don't have.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.987
We have moral sentiments,
and these moral sentiments may

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:51.562
lead us in our choices.
 

00:04:51.562 --> 00:04:52.180
Right?
 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.550
Now you can see--I mentioned
that about Adam Smith,

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.452
that Adam Smith might have had
this theory of sympathetic

00:05:01.452 --> 00:05:04.721
humans,
which in a way pointed this

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:05.769
direction.
 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:09.939
This is very central for John
Stuart Mill.

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:13.490
And therefore,
he emphasizes there is a

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.442
qualitative difference between
human and simply animal

00:05:18.442 --> 00:05:19.750
appetites.
 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.057
So therefore you simply cannot
do what Bentham did,

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:28.797
simply add up appetites and to
say if more appetites are

00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:32.329
satisfied, better off the
society is.

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:35.613
The chief good,
so he argues,

00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:37.019
is virtue.
 

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.069
Be virtuous and then you will
feel good;

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:43.139
you will be happier if you are
virtuous, as such.

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.475
But, you know,
these are all qualifications of

00:05:47.475 --> 00:05:51.329
the kind of elementary
utilitarianism;

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:55.298
I think qualifications but,
by the way, most rational

00:05:55.298 --> 00:05:59.343
choice theorists and most
neoclassical economists will

00:05:59.343 --> 00:06:00.870
also agree with.
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.456
Those who are critiques of
neo-liberals and utilitarianism

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:09.319
very often kind of caricature
their position,

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:13.860
not really understanding that
following John Stuart Mill--

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.821
they do understand that there
is a qualitative differences

00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:17.860
between utilities.
 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.290
But otherwise he remains by the
utilitarian principle.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.730
We are rational actors,
we are self-interested,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.810
we know what our needs are,
and we can make good judgments

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.391
whether the price we have to pay
in order to satisfy our needs is

00:06:34.391 --> 00:06:35.322
worth for us.
 

00:06:35.322 --> 00:06:36.110
Right?
 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.884
That is the fundamental idea of
utilitarianism,

00:06:39.884 --> 00:06:43.329
which is, thank you,
very healthy today.

00:06:43.329 --> 00:06:44.889
There are many people who
disagree with it.

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:47.137
There are many people who agree
with it.

00:06:47.137 --> 00:06:47.600
Right?
 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.230
But this is all John Stuart
Mill's addition.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.269
And now a bit on higher
happiness.

00:06:55.269 --> 00:07:00.156
Well the pleasure of the beast
might be felt as degrading by a

00:07:00.156 --> 00:07:01.117
human being.
 

00:07:01.117 --> 00:07:01.838
Right?
 

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:07.661
We want to have some--we have
higher needs than just the

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:09.250
animal needs.
 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.399
So you go to a five-star
restaurant where they serve you

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.189
a little food.
 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:22.149
It will be delicious,
but it will be unlike these

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:28.661
Italian family restaurants down
the road on Wooster Street where

00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:35.069
they give you food what you can
hardly eat which satisfies your

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:36.826
animal appetites.
 

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:38.170
Right?
 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.480
So anyway, we have higher
needs, higher appetites.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.949
We want to see our food served
in a special way.

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:51.490
We just don't feed our belly,
as such.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.620
And there are the pleasures of
the intellect and imagination;

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.952
I think we already have seen
this in Rousseau,

00:07:59.952 --> 00:08:02.250
how important imagination is.
 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.889
And if you are in comparative
literature or English,

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:11.240
of course the aesthetic
theories of Schiller,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:16.899
the German poet,
who emphasized how important

00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:25.389
actually imagination and play is
in figuring out what beauty is.

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:33.650
All right, and then a bit on
quality of pleasures.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.000
Right?
 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.214
Really the question is what
kind of pleasure satisfies us,

00:08:39.214 --> 00:08:41.580
rather than just the quantity.
 

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:49.408
And I think this is a very
powerful point.

00:08:49.408 --> 00:08:56.677
Well few humans would consent
to be changed into any of the

00:08:56.677 --> 00:08:58.432
lower animals.
 

00:08:58.432 --> 00:08:59.558
Right?
 

00:08:59.558 --> 00:09:04.125
No intelligent being would
consent to be a fool,

00:09:04.125 --> 00:09:09.660
even though they should be
persuaded that a fool is better

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.457
satisfied than a lot of man;
it's easier to satisfy

00:09:14.457 --> 00:09:16.070
occasionally a fool.
 

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:20.932
And this is really beautiful:
"It's better to be a human

00:09:20.932 --> 00:09:24.578
being dissatisfied than a pig
satisfied."

00:09:24.578 --> 00:09:25.389
Right?
 

00:09:25.389 --> 00:09:30.393
"Better to be Socrates
dissatisfied than a fool

00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:32.159
satisfied."
 

00:09:32.159 --> 00:09:33.940
Bingo, right?
 

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:35.230
He got it.
 

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:38.179
I think that's very beautifully
done, powerfully done.

00:09:38.179 --> 00:09:39.830
Think about it.
 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.023
Very hard to disagree with
this.

00:09:42.023 --> 00:09:42.590
Right?
 

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.669
You want to be Socrates and
dissatisfied,

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:51.668
rather than just being
satisfied by your needs.

00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:55.447
Well I don't want to dwell too
much on the issue of justice and

00:09:55.447 --> 00:09:56.240
legalities.
 

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.289
Quite obvious,
that there are differences

00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:03.428
between justice and legality.
 

00:10:03.428 --> 00:10:10.403
Well it is unjust if anybody's
deprived from his personal

00:10:10.403 --> 00:10:16.255
liberty or property,
even if that's what the law

00:10:16.255 --> 00:10:18.000
tells you.
 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.916
I mean, Communist government
confiscated property from

00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:26.424
people, and they did it legally,
but John Stuart Mill will say

00:10:26.424 --> 00:10:27.976
they did it unjustly.
 

00:10:27.976 --> 00:10:28.788
Right?
 

00:10:28.788 --> 00:10:31.549
It was legally done,
but unjustly.

00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:32.220
Right?
 

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:36.135
It was against the sense of
justice of people who are being

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.230
deprived from their property.
 

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.490
And there are laws which do not
exist,

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.553
though they should exist,
because some of the individual

00:10:46.553 --> 00:10:49.870
rights are not properly
defended,

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.139
and you really should have such
laws.

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:56.568
And, of course,
for him there has not been in

00:10:56.568 --> 00:11:01.010
his time sufficient laws to
protect the rights of women or

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:02.960
the rights of slaves.
 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.274
Well also today we are
concerned about whether we have

00:11:07.274 --> 00:11:11.917
proper protection in this
country for individual liberties

00:11:11.917 --> 00:11:15.817
against surveillance techniques,
for instance,

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:19.370
which were used very recently
in the United States.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.111
Many people think we need very
stricter controls on the

00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:26.647
government, whether they can
listen to our telephone

00:11:26.647 --> 00:11:27.616
conversations.
 

00:11:27.616 --> 00:11:28.379
Right?
 

00:11:28.379 --> 00:11:32.980
We want to have very clear laws
which define exactly what

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.048
torture is.
 

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:37.114
We may be uncertain whether the
laws are sufficiently clear.

00:11:37.114 --> 00:11:37.529
Right?
 

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:41.706
So therefore you need
occasionally laws which protects

00:11:41.706 --> 00:11:42.889
human rights.
 

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:46.259
This argument can be used
actually for affirmative action,

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:51.986
that you may need occasionally
laws which kind of eliminates

00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:55.870
the inequalities of people's
freedoms.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:12:00.842
Some people are less free than
others because they start from a

00:12:00.842 --> 00:12:03.009
different starting point.
 

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:06.629
Then you can use John Stuart
Mill's argument then to say you

00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:10.311
need a law which will protect
these people and make sure they

00:12:10.311 --> 00:12:14.160
are free enough,
that you create an equality of

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.850
freedom;
that would be his argument.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.409
And there are laws which exist
but they should not exist.

00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:23.278
There are bad and unjust laws.
 

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:28.850
Well we debate this issue a
great deal.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.461
I'm sure there are some people
in this country who do think

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.244
that the government should not
kill.

00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:37.038
Right?
 

00:12:37.038 --> 00:12:39.870
There are some people who are
against the death penalty.

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.610
Probably the majority is for
the death penalty,

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.538
but there is probably a
minority in this room--

00:12:45.538 --> 00:12:48.690
I don't want to ask you to show
hands,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:50.500
though I might
&gt;

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.657
--but I'm sure there are some
people who think the government

00:12:54.657 --> 00:12:56.389
should not kill people.
 

00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:57.610
I'm one of those.
 

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:59.600
I don't think that's right.
 

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.528
I think life is sacred.
 

00:13:01.528 --> 00:13:07.620
I believe sufficiently in
Hobbes' First Law of Nature,

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.840
no government should kill.
 

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.830
So death penalty,
I don't think it's right.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.686
But you can argue it's
necessary to defend other

00:13:18.686 --> 00:13:20.081
people's freedom.
 

00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:20.820
Right?
 

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:25.365
But I think John Stuart Mill
probably would have been unhappy

00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:27.259
with the death penalty.
 

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:33.402
So you may want to change
legislation.

00:13:33.402 --> 00:13:34.730
Right?
 

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.946
You may want to have a
legislation which eliminates the

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.899
death penalty.
 

00:13:38.899 --> 00:13:43.620
Or another issue is let's
say--again I'm sure this

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:48.918
audience here is divided on the
question of abortion.

00:13:48.918 --> 00:13:53.475
There are some people who
believe that abortion should be

00:13:53.475 --> 00:13:58.192
prohibited by law because you
should defend the freedom and

00:13:58.192 --> 00:14:01.283
right of existence of the unborn
child.

00:14:01.283 --> 00:14:02.259
Right?
 

00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:06.203
There are others who argue the
freedom argument on the other

00:14:06.203 --> 00:14:06.538
side.
 

00:14:06.538 --> 00:14:07.139
Right?
 

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:10.048
They say, "No,
you should not prohibit

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:14.067
abortion because you should
defend the liberty of the woman

00:14:14.067 --> 00:14:16.006
who carries the child."
 

00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:16.769
Right?
 

00:14:16.769 --> 00:14:21.759
Well, these are just examples
that these issues are talking to

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.970
very contemporary issues.
 

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.450
All right, justice and equality.
 

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:33.259
Well this is a very interesting
idea, what he's playing around.

00:14:33.259 --> 00:14:37.962
He said we have actually a
sense that justice is somehow

00:14:37.962 --> 00:14:42.856
related to equality--
that we occasionally feel that

00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:47.250
some degree of inequality is
already unjust.

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:51.071
Even if it is legally achieved
by legal means,

00:14:51.071 --> 00:14:53.279
we may see it is unjust.
 

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:59.172
Usually inequalities are
explained and justified by

00:14:59.172 --> 00:15:00.469
expediency.
 

00:15:00.469 --> 00:15:01.528
Right?
 

00:15:01.528 --> 00:15:04.778
You have to create these high
levels of inequality because you

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:06.269
have to create incentives.
 

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:10.899
We just heard this debate the
last couple of weeks.

00:15:10.899 --> 00:15:17.294
If you try to limit the bonuses
the guys on Wall Street do get,

00:15:17.294 --> 00:15:23.586
you do a lot of damage because
these hot brokers will be hired

00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:25.960
by the competition.
 

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:29.654
Therefore they have to get
these hundred million dollar

00:15:29.654 --> 00:15:32.537
bonuses;
otherwise the business will be

00:15:32.537 --> 00:15:32.903
hurt.
 

00:15:32.903 --> 00:15:33.490
Right?
 

00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:37.538
And there were banks which were
paying back billions of dollars

00:15:37.538 --> 00:15:41.263
to the federal government so the
federal government cannot

00:15:41.263 --> 00:15:44.855
intervene and cannot overrule
how much bonuses they pay.

00:15:44.855 --> 00:15:45.639
Right?
 

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:47.240
Expediency, right?
 

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:51.684
They say, "Oh give me a
break about this justice stuff,

00:15:51.684 --> 00:15:55.904
that this is unfair that
somebody earns a hundred million

00:15:55.904 --> 00:15:56.808
dollars.
 

00:15:56.808 --> 00:15:58.876
They should earn,
because otherwise the

00:15:58.876 --> 00:16:00.399
competition gets them."
 

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:00.889
Right?
 

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:05.096
Well this is the argument of
expediency, not the argument of

00:16:05.096 --> 00:16:05.668
justice.
 

00:16:05.668 --> 00:16:06.308
Right?
 

00:16:06.308 --> 00:16:11.788
All right, well there are
different components of justice.

00:16:11.788 --> 00:16:15.442
Well the first and most
important one:

00:16:15.442 --> 00:16:21.268
"It is unjust to deprive
anyone of his personal liberty

00:16:21.268 --> 00:16:23.538
and property."
 

00:16:23.538 --> 00:16:28.600
That's the most important point
in John Stuart Mill.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.820
He's staunchly defending
individual liberty.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.609
The second one:
"Legal right is deprived,

00:16:36.609 --> 00:16:41.577
may be rights which ought not
to have belonged to him."

00:16:41.577 --> 00:16:42.418
Right?
 

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:45.798
There may be privileges--I
mean, in contemporary societies

00:16:45.798 --> 00:16:47.399
this is much less common.
 

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:52.673
In his time there were a lot of
laws which defended people's

00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:57.946
privileges--feudal privileges,
what he wanted to get rid of.

00:16:57.946 --> 00:16:58.840
Right?
 

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.269
They were unjust.
 

00:17:02.269 --> 00:17:07.436
Well he also then suggests that
each person should obtain what

00:17:07.436 --> 00:17:11.672
he or she deserves,
even if it is not guaranteed by

00:17:11.672 --> 00:17:12.348
law.
 

00:17:12.348 --> 00:17:15.457
Well how far you go with this
argument--it again can be very

00:17:15.457 --> 00:17:16.298
controversial.
 

00:17:16.298 --> 00:17:19.913
You can say,
"Well you need a welfare

00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:20.618
state.
 

00:17:20.618 --> 00:17:25.186
You have to provide the basic
goods and services for

00:17:25.186 --> 00:17:26.798
everybody."
 

00:17:26.798 --> 00:17:30.140
You know, this argument can be
used.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.078
You have to provide housing.
 

00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:35.372
You should not let anybody
without shelter,

00:17:35.372 --> 00:17:39.368
or you should not let anybody
without healthcare.

00:17:39.368 --> 00:17:43.410
That would be consistent with
John Stuart Mill.

00:17:43.410 --> 00:17:47.563
And then he said,
"Well it is unjust if you

00:17:47.563 --> 00:17:49.154
break faith."
 

00:17:49.154 --> 00:17:49.950
Right?
 

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.021
You promise somebody I will do
it, and then you take your word

00:17:54.021 --> 00:17:54.490
back.
 

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:57.380
That's unjust;
you should not do that.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.604
And finally--this is very
important--justice cannot be

00:18:02.604 --> 00:18:03.392
partial.
 

00:18:03.392 --> 00:18:04.278
Right?
 

00:18:04.278 --> 00:18:10.539
It has to be blind and has to
be equal to all parties.

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:13.009
And now justice and expediency.
 

00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:14.848
I again don't want to labor on
this.

00:18:14.848 --> 00:18:18.097
This is obvious,
that what is expedient is not

00:18:18.097 --> 00:18:19.470
necessarily just.
 

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.391
Expedient is if you reach that
goal with minimum effort,

00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:27.670
but occasionally you don't--you
better not make shortcuts;

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:33.190
making those shortcuts may be
unjust and unfair.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.980
And then, of course,
sympathy.

00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:36.750
Right?
 

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.670
We are all capable to
sympathize, not only with people

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.868
we know but with the whole
humankind we have sympathy.

00:18:46.868 --> 00:18:51.618
Sympathy for our country and
our mankind.

00:18:51.618 --> 00:18:57.250
It's a bit like Rousseau's
l'amour propre idea.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:01.630
I think I'll probably skip this
one.

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:11.019
I think it's quite obvious why
justice and expediency do have a

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:15.108
complicated relationship.
 

00:19:15.108 --> 00:19:17.503
And now on the other book,
On Liberty.

00:19:17.503 --> 00:19:17.940
Right?
 

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.790
Well while Bentham only
emphasized that we are seeking

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:26.910
pleasure, Mill emphasized
self-development.

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:32.449
He said we have to--in our
lifetime, we have to develop our

00:19:32.449 --> 00:19:33.500
capacities.
 

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.358
Right?
 

00:19:34.358 --> 00:19:39.700
And what follows from this,
individualism and liberty;

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:44.980
these are the major values,
rather than just satisfying our

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.710
needs.
 

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:49.185
Well this is an extremely
important idea,

00:19:49.185 --> 00:19:53.009
and very much an idea of John
Stuart Mill.

00:19:53.009 --> 00:19:56.180
We should not take freedom as
granted.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:20:00.084
And he said,
"Be very careful of rulers

00:20:00.084 --> 00:20:02.900
who identify with the people.
 

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.380
It does not guarantee freedom,
because it can lead to the

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.460
tyranny of the majority.
 

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.220
You have to defend the rights
of the individuals,

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.762
the rights of the minorities,
that they should be also free

00:20:17.762 --> 00:20:19.328
to choose."
 

00:20:19.328 --> 00:20:23.718
This follows very logically
from his argument of these

00:20:23.718 --> 00:20:26.458
higher happinesses,
preferences,

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:29.288
arrived at by individual
judgments--

00:20:29.288 --> 00:20:33.673
not superimposed by government
but individuals decide what is

00:20:33.673 --> 00:20:36.890
the higher value they attach to
a utility.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:40.657
And therefore it can be
minorities which do have

00:20:40.657 --> 00:20:44.666
different preferences,
and we have to respect those

00:20:44.666 --> 00:20:45.950
preferences.
 

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:49.269
That's very crucially important
ideas.

00:20:49.269 --> 00:20:54.419
And individual liberty should
always take precedence over

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:57.730
short-term utilitarian
consideration.

00:20:57.730 --> 00:20:58.650
Right?
 

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.808
The main value is that
individually that--

00:21:01.808 --> 00:21:03.710
believe me, this is not a
contradiction,

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:07.452
it follows very logically from
the idea of preferences and from

00:21:07.452 --> 00:21:10.713
the idea that there are
qualitative differences between

00:21:10.713 --> 00:21:13.381
utilities,
and you are the only one who

00:21:13.381 --> 00:21:15.519
can decide what is worse for
you.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:19.368
Nobody else can make a
decision, a judgment for you.

00:21:19.368 --> 00:21:22.049
This is consistent with Adam
Smith, by the way.

00:21:22.049 --> 00:21:24.269
And then freedom of expression.
 

00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:28.914
There is nobody whom we will
read who stands so strongly for

00:21:28.914 --> 00:21:33.009
freedom of expression--complete,
unlimited freedom of

00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:34.190
expression.
 

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.284
And the United States comes
very close to this,

00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:41.386
and this is the only country in
the world which comes so close

00:21:41.386 --> 00:21:42.058
to it.
 

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:45.339
In other countries which are
democratic, free,

00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:47.964
and liberal,
freedom of speech may be

00:21:47.964 --> 00:21:48.838
limited.
 

00:21:48.838 --> 00:21:52.006
Hate speech may be actually
limited.

00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:52.730
Right?
 

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.753
Denying the Holocaust and you
end up in jail in Germany.

00:21:56.753 --> 00:21:57.338
Right?
 

00:21:57.338 --> 00:22:01.536
But in the U.S.,
we are very close to the

00:22:01.536 --> 00:22:03.108
Millian idea.
 

00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:08.474
And he said this is absolutely
necessary to have total freedom

00:22:08.474 --> 00:22:13.553
of speech because an opinion,
which suppressed right,

00:22:13.553 --> 00:22:19.358
then we lose the opportunity to
exchange truths for error.

00:22:19.358 --> 00:22:23.500
So therefore it's obvious that
it's non-controversial--that

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.925
truth, even if it's unpleasant,
should be allowed to be spoken.

00:22:27.925 --> 00:22:28.640
Right?
 

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:34.753
What is more problematic should
we allow to people to speak

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.019
falsehood?
 

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:41.078
I mean, we know that the
Holocaust existed.

00:22:41.078 --> 00:22:44.997
Should we allow those crazy
people to tell us,

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:48.913
against all this strong
evidence what we have,

00:22:48.913 --> 00:22:51.700
that there was no Holocaust?
 

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.169
He argues yes we should,
because this is the only way

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:58.838
how we can find out the error,
if we talk about this.

00:22:58.838 --> 00:23:01.108
It's a very controversial
argument.

00:23:01.108 --> 00:23:04.463
As I said, there are not many
countries in this world which do

00:23:04.463 --> 00:23:05.345
subscribe to it.
 

00:23:05.345 --> 00:23:05.838
Right?
 

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:11.450
So, and he said we have to
listen to both sides;

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:14.509
that's the only way how we find
out what the truth is.

00:23:14.509 --> 00:23:16.910
And tyranny by the majority.
 

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:20.009
Well this is a very,
very important argument;

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:32.737
namely, one of the major evils
of a mass democratic society is

00:23:32.737 --> 00:23:38.578
a tyranny of the majority.
 

00:23:38.578 --> 00:23:43.443
There will be a very strong
tendency to suppress dissent and

00:23:43.443 --> 00:23:47.318
to create conformity with the
majority views.

00:23:47.318 --> 00:23:52.378
And he said well,
we have to try to resist it,

00:23:52.378 --> 00:23:56.990
and we have to emphasize
individuality.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:02.022
Conformism is moral repression.
 

00:24:02.022 --> 00:24:03.160
Right?
 

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:07.338
There's a lot of pressure on
you to conform with the

00:24:07.338 --> 00:24:11.435
major--the mainstream,
as such, and he said this is

00:24:11.435 --> 00:24:15.368
one of the big evils what we
have to resist.

00:24:15.368 --> 00:24:21.693
We have to defend individual
liberties, and we have to fight

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:25.623
against intervention;
legal or non-legal

00:24:25.623 --> 00:24:26.679
intervention.
 

00:24:26.679 --> 00:24:27.328
Right?
 

00:24:27.328 --> 00:24:30.660
He did not live in a mass
communication society,

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:35.607
but he would have been outraged
how the media tries to brainwash

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:39.614
people and put into a conformist
behavior on people.

00:24:39.614 --> 00:24:40.400
Right?
 

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.963
He wanted to defend people's
individual choices of lifestyles

00:24:44.963 --> 00:24:48.539
and sexual preferences and
whatever you name;

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:50.140
it has to be defended.
 

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:52.880
And this is very important.
 

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.690
This is a clear extension,
very clearly argued--

00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:02.058
Adam Smith did basically agree
with this,

00:25:02.058 --> 00:25:04.970
but he did not put it so
strongly and so clearly--

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.354
"Therefore intervention by
a government is only permissible

00:25:09.354 --> 00:25:11.720
if injury has taken place."
 

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:16.550
The government cannot limit
individual liberties,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.470
only if that causes injury.
 

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.790
And he said,
"Look, believe me,

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:23.250
I'm not indifferent.
 

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.470
I am for compassion.
 

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.380
All what I am asking you is
tolerance.

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:31.950
Respect other people's choices.
 

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:36.354
Do feel compassion,
but don't try to make decisions

00:25:36.354 --> 00:25:39.204
for others;
don't impose your will on

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.160
others."
 

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.018
That's I think the--and
conformity, he really disliked

00:25:45.018 --> 00:25:46.210
conformity.
 

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.130
It's a century ahead of his
time.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.624
This becomes a very big issue
in the 1960s and '70s,

00:25:53.624 --> 00:25:58.383
that conformism is an evil,
and he already writes about

00:25:58.383 --> 00:26:01.819
this in the mid-nineteenth
century.

00:26:01.819 --> 00:26:05.058
And well interference.
 

00:26:05.058 --> 00:26:10.615
The only justification is
self-protection.

00:26:10.615 --> 00:26:11.700
Right?
 

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:19.838
This is very much in line of
Hobbes' argument.

00:26:19.838 --> 00:26:24.012
And therefore he said,
"I'm not for indifference,

00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:28.660
but I am for permissiveness,
for tolerance as such."

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:34.904
Well we should help each other,
but that's different than to

00:26:34.904 --> 00:26:41.570
impose our will or our taste or
our preferences on other people.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:42.630
Right?
 

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:47.298
"Neither one person,
nor any number of person,

00:26:47.298 --> 00:26:50.586
is warranted in saying to other
human creatures of ripe

00:26:50.586 --> 00:26:52.957
years"--
that's different with

00:26:52.957 --> 00:26:57.191
children--"that he shall
not do with his life for his own

00:26:57.191 --> 00:27:00.175
benefit what he chooses to do
with it."

00:27:00.175 --> 00:27:00.940
Right?
 

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.740
A very strong argument,
and very troubling.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.680
You know?
 

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.576
What do you think about drug
use?

00:27:07.576 --> 00:27:08.048
Right?
 

00:27:08.048 --> 00:27:13.480
Well if John Stuart Mill errs,
he errs on the libertarian

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.160
side.
 

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.913
He probably would be arguing
for the decriminalization of

00:27:18.913 --> 00:27:22.140
most of the drugs,
on these grounds.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.519
It's people's choice.
 

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:26.630
If they know that they hurt
their life, this is their story.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:31.568
Now very briefly on his views
on women.

00:27:31.568 --> 00:27:35.400
And I don't have to introduce
you to the background.

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.578
You know that in the
mid-nineteenth century women did

00:27:38.578 --> 00:27:41.145
not have equal rights,
even not in England,

00:27:41.145 --> 00:27:42.920
not in the United States.
 

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.094
They not only did not have the
right to vote,

00:27:46.094 --> 00:27:50.134
but they actually did not have
the right to own property,

00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:51.000
as such.
 

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.603
Well as I mentioned,
Harriet Taylor,

00:27:54.603 --> 00:27:59.647
his lover and wife,
was a radical feminist--as far

00:27:59.647 --> 00:28:03.868
as we know, an extremely smart
woman.

00:28:03.868 --> 00:28:08.741
She was more radical than
Smith, because she actually,

00:28:08.741 --> 00:28:13.153
as I pointed out,
opposed even the institution of

00:28:13.153 --> 00:28:14.348
marriage.
 

00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:17.568
So what are the major themes in
this book?

00:28:17.568 --> 00:28:21.213
The first point is
"marriage is the only

00:28:21.213 --> 00:28:24.029
remaining case of slavery."
 

00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:26.250
Well it's not true of course.
 

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:30.060
Slavery has existed elsewhere,
and unfortunately de facto

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:32.240
still exists around the world.
 

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:35.315
But he said,
you know, "The subjugation

00:28:35.315 --> 00:28:39.534
of women is a case of slavery,
and it cannot be explained by

00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:41.680
the nature of women."
 

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.048
And he makes a case for it.
 

00:28:43.048 --> 00:28:48.000
He argues for legal equality in
marriage, and equality of women

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.313
in politics and education,
and finally makes a case for

00:28:52.313 --> 00:28:54.150
marital friendship.
 

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.960
So he said marriage is the only
remaining example of slavery

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.900
because they cannot own property
and,

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:10.900
in fact, their husbands can use
them for sexual desires.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.509
So in this sense it is even
worse than slavery.

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:19.355
At least the slaves are not
expected to love their slave

00:29:19.355 --> 00:29:22.471
owners;
the wives are expected to love

00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:23.710
their husbands.
 

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:27.364
So he said this is even worse
than slavery.

00:29:27.364 --> 00:29:28.058
Right?
 

00:29:28.058 --> 00:29:34.838
And here he kind of elaborates
on this issue--that it is not

00:29:34.838 --> 00:29:41.618
simply the obedience what man
wants, but also their love.

00:29:41.618 --> 00:29:48.102
And usually these relationships
were in the nineteenth century,

00:29:48.102 --> 00:29:53.329
and in many cases even in the
twenty-first century,

00:29:53.329 --> 00:29:54.689
asymmetrical.
 

00:29:54.689 --> 00:29:55.838
Right?
 

00:29:55.838 --> 00:29:59.673
Man probably does not feel as
much obliged to express love

00:29:59.673 --> 00:30:03.576
towards their wives than they
expect their wives to express

00:30:03.576 --> 00:30:04.989
love towards the man.
 

00:30:04.989 --> 00:30:05.730
Right?
 

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:08.858
Unfortunately I think there are
still men like this.

00:30:08.858 --> 00:30:14.107
Okay, so that's I think very
provocative, very important

00:30:14.107 --> 00:30:19.069
statements, written in the
mid-nineteenth century.

00:30:19.069 --> 00:30:20.818
Well, and then he said.
 

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:23.940
"This cannot be explained
by the nature of women."

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:28.179
He expects the counterargument
well different--you know,

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:31.880
the Rousseauian argument,
women are different.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.328
They want to knit,
they want to be subjugated.

00:30:34.328 --> 00:30:37.890
He said, no,
there are two counterarguments.

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:42.224
One is that we don't know what
the nature of women are because

00:30:42.224 --> 00:30:45.779
they did not have a chance for
self-development.

00:30:45.779 --> 00:30:50.680
And then he said in order to
justify women's sublimation,

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.644
you should be able to show that
no women were ever capable to

00:30:54.644 --> 00:30:57.950
occupy certain positions of
political authority.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.747
If there were women who did
that, then it cannot come from

00:31:01.747 --> 00:31:03.079
the nature of women.
 

00:31:03.079 --> 00:31:03.680
Right?
 

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.049
That's a neat argument.
 

00:31:07.049 --> 00:31:10.828
Well here is the citation.
 

00:31:10.828 --> 00:31:17.019
"How would we know what
the nature of the women is?

00:31:17.019 --> 00:31:21.460
Therefore this is an invalid
argument."

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:26.016
He argues for the equality for
marriage, and that's today a

00:31:26.016 --> 00:31:30.653
kind of commonsensical;
it doesn't need any further

00:31:30.653 --> 00:31:31.940
elaboration.
 

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:35.650
And equality of women in
politics and education and jobs.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.578
This is still very important.
 

00:31:37.578 --> 00:31:40.430
Larry Summers,
the president of Harvard,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:44.498
probably had not read his John
Stuart Mill carefully enough

00:31:44.498 --> 00:31:48.215
when he said that women are just
not good enough to do

00:31:48.215 --> 00:31:49.057
engineering.
 

00:31:49.057 --> 00:31:49.828
Right?
 

00:31:49.828 --> 00:31:52.630
He should have read John Stuart
Mill,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:56.234
and he should have known there
is nothing in the nature of

00:31:56.234 --> 00:31:59.777
women why they would not do as
well in engineering as men

00:31:59.777 --> 00:32:00.410
would.
 

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:04.398
Sort of--and,
you know, we still need some

00:32:04.398 --> 00:32:08.221
attention to diversity,
women's diversity,

00:32:08.221 --> 00:32:12.384
in order to make sure that
women do end up in political and

00:32:12.384 --> 00:32:13.390
other jobs.
 

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:16.118
And then he makes a case for
marital friendship.

00:32:16.118 --> 00:32:19.713
He said, "Well I still
believe in marriage because

00:32:19.713 --> 00:32:23.309
marriage can be based on
equality of partners."

00:32:23.309 --> 00:32:25.069
So this is John Stuart Mill.
 

00:32:25.069 --> 00:32:28.430
I hope you enjoy him.
 

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:33.346
I think he is a controversial
person, pushes his point as far

00:32:33.346 --> 00:32:34.328
as it can.
 

00:32:34.328 --> 00:32:37.338
But I think he's a very smart
person.

00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:46.548
So let me just--I have twelve
more minutes to go--

00:32:46.548 --> 00:32:53.914
and look at the questions and
make a few comments how I would

00:32:53.914 --> 00:33:00.789
try to myself deal with these
questions in answering,

00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:03.400
if I were in your shoes.
 

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.309
Okay.
 

00:33:07.309 --> 00:33:10.049
And here we go.
 

00:33:10.049 --> 00:33:15.190
Let me see how far I can go.
 

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:21.548
Okay, so question number one.
 

00:33:21.548 --> 00:33:27.086
The first point what I would
try to make here is there are

00:33:27.086 --> 00:33:32.430
people who read Hobbes as
believing that humans are evil

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.789
by nature.
 

00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:36.568
This is not unreasonable.
 

00:33:36.568 --> 00:33:39.794
After all, why on earth you
need a Leviathan,

00:33:39.794 --> 00:33:42.450
unless there is something wrong
with us?

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:47.035
One can also say well Locke
puts a lot of emphasis how

00:33:47.035 --> 00:33:52.484
rational we are in the state of
nature, and Rousseau is explicit

00:33:52.484 --> 00:33:54.907
about his noble savage idea.
 

00:33:54.907 --> 00:33:55.859
Right?
 

00:33:55.859 --> 00:33:57.960
It is society which corrupts.
 

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.003
We all come out perfect from
the hands of the creator and

00:34:02.003 --> 00:34:03.808
then society screws us.
 

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:07.647
So there seems to be really an
argument here,

00:34:07.647 --> 00:34:12.969
would I try to say it quickly,
that there is a controversy.

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:17.251
Well I may try to qualify it in
a sentence or two--that of

00:34:17.251 --> 00:34:21.159
course Hobbes could be read in a
more complex way.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:27.268
Because after all Hobbes also
believes that we are making

00:34:27.268 --> 00:34:34.034
rational decisions when we are
sort of adjudicating between our

00:34:34.034 --> 00:34:38.480
desires and our fears,
and we come to a rational

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.739
decision about this.
 

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:43.260
Therefore it's not that obvious
that this is,

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:47.579
maybe, but I would say that
this is a qualification;

00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:50.099
that is, still one can see a
controversy.

00:34:50.099 --> 00:34:55.780
Well Rousseau,
yes he states that we are,

00:34:55.780 --> 00:35:00.679
you know, come out perfect from
the hands of God,

00:35:00.679 --> 00:35:03.630
but after all in the state of
nature we are savages,

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:10.092
and therefore we need some
general will to overrule our

00:35:10.092 --> 00:35:11.530
judgments.
 

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:16.353
So there is some qualification
how much faith Jean Jacques had

00:35:16.353 --> 00:35:16.827
in us.
 

00:35:16.827 --> 00:35:17.539
Right?
 

00:35:17.539 --> 00:35:20.139
He had a bit suspicious of us.
 

00:35:20.139 --> 00:35:24.853
So these are the kind of
footnotes, qualifications to the

00:35:24.853 --> 00:35:25.780
argument.
 

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:29.561
But then I would love--what I
would do, I would say,

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:33.789
"Well I am a bit tormented
what to think about it.

00:35:33.789 --> 00:35:34.920
You know?
 

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:40.128
Because I do know that indeed
people can be quite evil.

00:35:40.128 --> 00:35:40.900
Right?
 

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:45.829
And therefore we do need law
and order, we do need some

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:47.199
intervention.
 

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:51.152
On the other hand,
I think I am probably more

00:35:51.152 --> 00:35:53.771
inclined,
if I have to err,

00:35:53.771 --> 00:35:58.579
to err on the side of Rousseau
or John Stuart Mill,

00:35:58.579 --> 00:36:05.586
to believe that people are
after all ethical and will act

00:36:05.586 --> 00:36:07.840
out of goodwill.
 

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.168
And therefore I would like to
see less of central planners

00:36:12.168 --> 00:36:16.650
telling me what I should be
doing and what my needs are,

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:21.005
and I would better live in a
society where individuals can

00:36:21.005 --> 00:36:24.820
decide,
make their free choices."

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:26.039
That would be my line.
 

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:28.472
But you could argue the other
way around.

00:36:28.472 --> 00:36:28.960
Right?
 

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.570
Tell us what your view is.
 

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.789
Anyway, that's the way how I
would deal with this question.

00:36:33.789 --> 00:36:39.760
That's I think quite clear.
 

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.291
Hobbes believed in a strong and
clearly identifiable

00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:46.199
sovereign--easy to support it
with text.

00:36:46.199 --> 00:36:48.099
I think this is uncontroversial.
 

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:52.804
And it's also quite clear that
Locke wanted to limit the power

00:36:52.804 --> 00:36:54.268
of the executive.
 

00:36:54.268 --> 00:36:58.407
That's why he wants to separate
the executive from the

00:36:58.407 --> 00:36:59.500
legislative.
 

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.755
So I did that,
and in comparing them is now

00:37:02.755 --> 00:37:04.539
pretty controversial.
 

00:37:04.539 --> 00:37:07.461
You don't have to have many
qualifications to this.

00:37:07.461 --> 00:37:07.929
Right?
 

00:37:07.929 --> 00:37:09.489
That's quite straightforward.
 

00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:14.730
Now, what do you think,
what is your view on this?

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:18.130
And you may say,
"Well, Hobbes has got a

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.599
lot to say."
 

00:37:19.599 --> 00:37:23.320
Think about September 11th,
9/11.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:24.250
Right?
 

00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:27.402
Well we need a strong
government.

00:37:27.402 --> 00:37:28.190
Right?
 

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.739
We need security. Right?
 

00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:33.300
We just cannot push too far for
equality.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.018
Or you can take the opposite
argument.

00:37:35.018 --> 00:37:38.418
He said--"Well I think all
what happened after 9/11 was

00:37:38.418 --> 00:37:38.880
wrong.
 

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.079
We should not have limited
individual liberties.

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:44.324
That's the American way,
that you stand by

00:37:44.324 --> 00:37:45.199
liberty."
 

00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:48.344
Anyway, I'm sure people are
divided on this,

00:37:48.344 --> 00:37:51.710
and I would like to hear your
views on this.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.860
It's a hard question to answer.
 

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.277
In fact, it is also a question
who is a methodological

00:37:58.277 --> 00:38:01.280
individualist,
and a collectivist?

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.425
I would say a methodological
collectivist argues that there

00:38:05.425 --> 00:38:09.570
is stuff which is more than the
sum total of individual.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.719
Montesquieu's emphasis on law
is a very good one--

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:16.550
that the law,
you cannot explain the law by

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.730
looking at each individual and
end it up and that's the law.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.893
The law is there,
and then it enters the

00:38:22.893 --> 00:38:23.559
individuals.
 

00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:24.059
Right?
 

00:38:24.059 --> 00:38:27.215
So there is a collective
conscience which precedes the

00:38:27.215 --> 00:38:29.360
individual and enters
individuals.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.985
And others like Hobbes or Locke
argues the other way:

00:38:31.985 --> 00:38:34.460
"No, we have to start with
the individual.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.255
The only thing what we can
observe is the individual action

00:38:38.255 --> 00:38:41.525
and desires and will,
and then we can arrive at the

00:38:41.525 --> 00:38:42.769
collectivity."
 

00:38:42.769 --> 00:38:43.489
Right?
 

00:38:43.489 --> 00:38:47.663
Well I'm not so sure whether
you are a methodological

00:38:47.663 --> 00:38:49.510
individualist or not.
 

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.534
But you can actually make a
case whether you really think

00:38:53.534 --> 00:38:57.489
whether the right way is to
think about the individual's

00:38:57.489 --> 00:39:01.494
action and the individuals,
rather about the collective

00:39:01.494 --> 00:39:04.958
good which comes from something,
somewhere else more

00:39:04.958 --> 00:39:05.929
historically.
 

00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:12.179
Well Rousseau's general will
makes a strong case for it--easy

00:39:12.179 --> 00:39:13.949
to make, right?
 

00:39:13.949 --> 00:39:17.159
There is obviously something
what is necessary for a general

00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:17.539
will.
 

00:39:17.539 --> 00:39:22.797
You want to believe,
for instance,

00:39:22.797 --> 00:39:28.998
in universal healthcare,
and to say, "Well this

00:39:28.998 --> 00:39:32.516
should not be left to
individuals to decide whether

00:39:32.516 --> 00:39:35.400
they take out health insurance
or not.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.289
Everybody should be insured,
right?

00:39:37.289 --> 00:39:39.570
It's easy to see, right?
 

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:41.849
Let's not fool us around, right?
 

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:43.699
We need a general will."
 

00:39:43.699 --> 00:39:45.880
So I think an argument can be
made.

00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:51.114
But then you can use Locke or
Montesquieu or Mill or whomever

00:39:51.114 --> 00:39:56.090
to say, "Well there is
trouble with this argument.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:59.130
Where on earth the general will
is coming from?"

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:01.681
Like methodological
individualists,

00:40:01.681 --> 00:40:06.260
usually--let's say what about
methodological collectivists?

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.523
Where do you know what it is?
 

00:40:08.523 --> 00:40:09.070
Right?
 

00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:12.708
Where does it come from,
if it is not in any individual

00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:14.260
consciousness,
right?

00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:18.510
So where--how do government
know what is my need?

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:21.960
Did they get a letter telling
them what my needs are and

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.409
overrule my decision that I
think this is my need and my

00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:26.099
preference?
 

00:40:26.099 --> 00:40:26.789
Right?
 

00:40:26.789 --> 00:40:28.079
So that can be devastating.
 

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:30.496
And you can say,
"Well this opens up the

00:40:30.496 --> 00:40:32.144
door to totalitarianism."
 

00:40:32.144 --> 00:40:32.639
Right?
 

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:36.730
That's why Karl Marx loved Jean
Jacques Rousseau so much.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.159
That's why Lenin loved Jean
Jacques Rousseau so much,

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:43.960
because they wanted to have the
central planners which tell you,

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.400
"This is your need.
 

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.659
You don't--you know only your
short-term needs.

00:40:47.659 --> 00:40:51.467
I know your long-term needs and
therefore you have to do what I

00:40:51.467 --> 00:40:52.757
tell you to do."
 

00:40:52.757 --> 00:40:53.309
Right?
 

00:40:53.309 --> 00:40:55.510
And Rousseau does that, right?
 

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.936
He says, "You have to be
forced to be free.

00:40:58.936 --> 00:40:59.519
Right?
 

00:40:59.519 --> 00:41:01.630
I can't let you just to be free.
 

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.291
I have to tell you what your
real freedom is,

00:41:04.291 --> 00:41:06.289
what your real needs are."
 

00:41:06.289 --> 00:41:07.849
And you can be critical about
this.

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:10.820
So you see, you can make the
point in both directions.

00:41:10.820 --> 00:41:13.340
I think both are respectable
positions.

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:18.730
Well Adam Smith pursues
self-interest;

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.469
you achieve the common good.
 

00:41:20.469 --> 00:41:22.525
Many of you believe in this.
 

00:41:22.525 --> 00:41:23.039
Right?
 

00:41:23.039 --> 00:41:25.717
Let's have free,
unregulated markets,

00:41:25.717 --> 00:41:29.510
and then it will end up with
the collective good.

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.266
But, you know,
Rousseau believes in the

00:41:32.266 --> 00:41:35.096
general will,
which is more than the sum

00:41:35.096 --> 00:41:36.909
total of individuals.
 

00:41:36.909 --> 00:41:38.559
Well you can contrast it.
 

00:41:38.559 --> 00:41:40.601
It's very similar to the
previous question.

00:41:40.601 --> 00:41:40.989
Right?
 

00:41:40.989 --> 00:41:44.711
And you can make a case,
you know, why you think Adam

00:41:44.711 --> 00:41:48.932
Smith is right;
where on earth you will figure

00:41:48.932 --> 00:41:53.237
out what needs are,
unless people decide for

00:41:53.237 --> 00:41:54.639
themselves?
 

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:57.206
Or you can say,
"Well Adam Smith is not

00:41:57.206 --> 00:42:01.527
living in the real world,
because he assumes perfect

00:42:01.527 --> 00:42:06.719
self-regulating markets and
perfect informations,

00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:08.590
and none of those exist.
 

00:42:08.590 --> 00:42:11.635
So in the real world Adam Smith
does not apply,

00:42:11.635 --> 00:42:14.813
and in the real world,
well actually Jean Jacques

00:42:14.813 --> 00:42:17.530
Rousseau makes much more
sense."

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.952
Well again your call,
how you make your decision

00:42:20.952 --> 00:42:21.900
about this.
 

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:27.221
Well strong government,
by Hobbes, and Smith is about

00:42:27.221 --> 00:42:31.108
invisible hand,
as little government as

00:42:31.108 --> 00:42:32.440
possible.
 

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.750
Again, I don't think I have to
elaborate on this;

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:37.820
you can see the line of
argument.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.179
Easy to show that Hobbes indeed
stood for strong government.

00:42:41.179 --> 00:42:45.699
You have the citation--Adam
Smith, for the invisible hand.

00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:48.829
You can add the footnote there
is a controversy about this,

00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:53.275
but most people today in the
twenty-first century interpret

00:42:53.275 --> 00:42:57.489
Adam Smith as the person of the
invisible hand and small

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:58.639
government.
 

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:00.610
And then you can say what is
your view.

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:03.516
And again I think this class
must be split,

00:43:03.516 --> 00:43:05.039
fifty/fifty percent.
 

00:43:05.039 --> 00:43:08.150
Some people still believe,
you know, Ronald Reagan,

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:11.632
the government is not the
solution, the government is the

00:43:11.632 --> 00:43:12.380
problem.
 

00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:17.659
Other people believe
in--liberal democrats who say,

00:43:17.659 --> 00:43:19.360
"No, no,
no, we need big government,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.360
and just see what happened now
in the global financial crisis,

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:27.554
when there was not enough
government and there was too

00:43:27.554 --> 00:43:28.760
much deregulation.
 

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.809
We need regulation,
and just see what George

00:43:31.809 --> 00:43:32.800
W.***Bush did.
 

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.440
Right?
 

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.170
He bailed out from taxpayers'
money."

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:39.309
Anyway, you see the point,
what you can do.

00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:41.110
You can argue it both ways.
 

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:43.980
Well the gender issue.
 

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:49.639
Well hard to defend Rousseau,
he really sucks.

00:43:49.639 --> 00:43:51.800
&gt;
 

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.019
But read him carefully.
 

00:43:56.019 --> 00:43:57.530
I gave you the citations.
 

00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.063
He said--well he foreshadows
the idea of distinction between

00:44:02.063 --> 00:44:03.369
sex and gender.
 

00:44:03.369 --> 00:44:06.980
One can say he's a
sophisticated feminist.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.079
He said women should not look
like men.

00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:13.483
They have equally humans,
they have the same human

00:44:13.483 --> 00:44:17.445
rights, but it would be wrong
for women to dress like men.

00:44:17.445 --> 00:44:18.139
Right?
 

00:44:18.139 --> 00:44:21.760
What's wrong about a woman
being feminine?

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.099
There are some contemporary
feminists who argue this way.

00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:27.449
So don't dismiss him too easy.
 

00:44:27.449 --> 00:44:31.454
Well Mill I don't think needs
too much defense for feminists,

00:44:31.454 --> 00:44:35.125
though I could offer some
criticism, feminist criticism,

00:44:35.125 --> 00:44:35.860
of him.
 

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.268
Well Mill was a utilitarian.
 

00:44:38.268 --> 00:44:44.070
Well what is his difference
between Adam Smith?

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.268
Well this is a hard question to
ask.

00:44:46.268 --> 00:44:48.110
There is not that much
difference.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.188
But as I was trying to point
out in the lecture today,

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.989
there is a difference,
right?

00:44:52.989 --> 00:44:57.525
John Stuart Mill is much more
conscious about preferences and

00:44:57.525 --> 00:45:02.289
the qualitative differences we
attach to different utilities.

00:45:02.289 --> 00:45:07.059
The idea is not something what
Adam Smith would oppose to,

00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:11.403
but certainly an idea which has
not been as elaborately

00:45:11.403 --> 00:45:16.070
developed in Adam Smith than it
was in John Stuart Mill.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:21.170
Well this is very easy, right?
 

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.599
Again, Hobbes arguing for
security and Mill or Locke

00:45:25.599 --> 00:45:27.510
arguing for freedom.
 

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:32.561
You can make the case,
we have done it in earlier

00:45:32.561 --> 00:45:37.929
questions, and you can tell us
what do you think.

00:45:37.929 --> 00:45:40.300
Again I think the room will be
split.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.699
Do you want to allow people to
carry guns?

00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:46.969
Some people think yes,
for individual liberty.

00:45:46.969 --> 00:45:49.059
Others will say,
"This is crazy.

00:45:49.059 --> 00:45:52.123
Most countries in the world
wouldn't allow it,

00:45:52.123 --> 00:45:56.210
and just see these mutts mass
murdering people in schools.

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.909
Of course they do,
if they can carry guns."

00:45:58.909 --> 00:46:01.210
9/11, right?
 

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:02.780
Torture.
 

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:05.250
Listening to people's telephone
conversations.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.117
Some people will say,
"Well we are living in a

00:46:08.117 --> 00:46:10.697
dangerous world,
we should allow the CIA to do

00:46:10.697 --> 00:46:11.960
that." Right?
 

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.835
Others will say,
"No, no,

00:46:13.835 --> 00:46:14.159
no.
 

00:46:14.159 --> 00:46:16.554
Our individual liberties are
sacrosanct."

00:46:16.554 --> 00:46:16.980
Right?
 

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.960
And this is what I would like
to hear from you.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:22.659
Okay, have fun,
and please do enjoy it.

00:46:22.659 --> 00:46:23.440
Right?
 

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.480
It's not regurgitating.
 

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.860
This exercise is about thinking.
 

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:35.000

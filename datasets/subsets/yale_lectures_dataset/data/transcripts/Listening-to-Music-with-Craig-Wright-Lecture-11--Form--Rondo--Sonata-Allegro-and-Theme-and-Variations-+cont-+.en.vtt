00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.492
Prof: Okay,
let me just check the

00:00:02.492 --> 00:00:04.440
volume--sounds okay,
let's get started.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.167
This week we're going to
continue our discussion of

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:10.043
musical form,
and we're going to fold that

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:13.980
discussion inside of the
preparation for the concert,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770
which is when?
 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.600
Saturday.
 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.090
And it is where?
 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.960
Battell Chapel.
 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.830
It should be on the sheet
there, and it's at 8:00 p.m.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.176
And we're going to have the
Saybrook Orchestra perform for

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:28.470
us.
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.012
Today we're going to talk about
theme and variations,

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.310
and one of the pieces that's on
that concert.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.595
And then on Thursday,
we're going to have the

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:38.661
conductor and several of the
soloists come in and talk to us

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:41.726
about the difficulties of this
particular concert and get us

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:45.051
alerted to the sort of the thing
that we should be on the lookout

00:00:45.051 --> 00:00:46.350
for as reviewers.
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.945
We will be continuing with
this, of course,

00:00:49.945 --> 00:00:52.000
in sections this week.
 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.452
And when you come to lecture
next time, we will give you what

00:00:55.452 --> 00:00:58.904
I call a prep sheet--a sort of
guide to all three pieces that

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:00.630
are going to be performed.
 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.753
And then when you go to
section, you will get a sheet

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:09.989
having to do with how you write
a review.

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:11.465
It's a whole list of sort of
"do's"

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:13.010
and "don't's"
in writing a review.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.992
Those of you that are in the
Monday section:

00:01:15.992 --> 00:01:18.420
we will work this out in
advance.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.918
We'll talk about that on
Thursday, but you may be

00:01:20.918 --> 00:01:23.209
encouraged to come to an earlier
section,

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:26.461
and if that doesn't work out
we're going to re-form those

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.830
Monday sections in a way that
will work for you as well.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.941
I know there are a couple of
students also that can't be here

00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.720
this weekend.
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.390
It's inevitable that that's the
case.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.986
There will be a makeup concert
scheduled at a later date so

00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:42.331
don't worry about this,
but do keep coming because the

00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.678
principles involved in writing a
review for this particular

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:48.910
concert are identical to
whatever concert you attend.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.470
Any questions about that before
we get started?

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.715
Okay.
 

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:56.129
If not, let's go ahead with the
concert program.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:57.080
It's kind of fun.
 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.819
I started with this way early
last August, arranging this.

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.063
What I wanted to do was get a
concert coming in the middle of

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:09.884
the term because I think you're
ready now to go at this

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:14.270
serious-material concert in the
middle of the term performed by

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.162
an undergraduate orchestra in
which the program would be

00:02:18.162 --> 00:02:20.800
user-friendly--
would be the kinds of things

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.919
that we had been working with.
 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.810
So I contacted a couple of
ensembles,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.985
and the Saybrook group,
1) had the best program and 2)

00:02:26.985 --> 00:02:30.822
seemed to be quite responsive in
getting back to me about some of

00:02:30.822 --> 00:02:32.740
the things that we might do.
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.187
And indeed one of the pieces,
the Brahms that we're going to

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.048
talk about,
I suggested that they do

00:02:37.048 --> 00:02:39.437
because I needed--
for teaching purposes in

00:02:39.437 --> 00:02:42.250
here--I needed a good theme and
variation piece.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.910
And I've got one in the
Beethoven, but it's not quite as

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.240
clear cut as this particular
one.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.759
So, as you can see,
we have three pieces on this

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:52.508
concert.
 

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:53.919
I hope you all have the sheet
there.

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.375
They should be listed:
the overture to The Marriage

00:02:57.375 --> 00:02:59.068
of Figaro by Mozart.
 

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:02.295
This is an overture,
an opening to his opera The

00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:03.908
Marriage of Figaro.
 

00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:07.777
And good news here:
that this spring the Yale Opera

00:03:07.777 --> 00:03:10.088
Company,
an undergraduate opera company,

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:12.490
will be performing The
Marriage of Figaro,

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.280
and it's an absolutely
delightful opera.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.460
It's to die for.
 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.532
Not only is it lots of fun and
funny, but it happens to be in

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.401
terms of the craftsmanship
involved arguably the greatest

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.580
opera ever written.
 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.552
So we're fortunate to have it
here and you'll get a preview of

00:03:26.552 --> 00:03:28.991
this, this Saturday,
with the overture that we will

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:29.430
hear.
 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.430
Then we will go on to a piece
by Johannes Brahms.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.860
Anybody know anything about
Brahms?

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.950
There are interesting
characters in the history of

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.620
music.
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.809
Wagner: he might have been an
"SOB"

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:44.699
but nonetheless,
he was interesting.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.400
Mozart is endlessly fascinating.
 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.126
Bach is interesting in his own
way, Beethoven--sort of the

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:53.330
prototypical romantic genius,
very interesting.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.979
I can't say that Brahms's
person--personal life was all

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:58.091
that interesting,
so maybe we'll just forget

00:03:58.091 --> 00:03:58.729
about it.
 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.328
We'll just say that he was born
in Hamburg, Germany,

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:06.067
and he died in Vienna,
and I may have put his dates on

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:09.326
your sheet there,
but he is, of course,

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:12.008
one of the "three
Bs."

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.704
Who are the other two in the
history of music,

00:04:15.704 --> 00:04:16.689
of course?
 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.740
Bach and Beethoven.
 

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.903
I once asked in a quiz in here
who are the "three Bs"

00:04:22.903 --> 00:04:24.899
of music,
and a student answered,

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:26.970
"Bach, Beethoven,
and Haydn."

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.670
I was very depressed for the
rest of the day.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.843
But Brahms indeed is the third
B here so we don't want to

00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:35.259
forget about him.
 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:36.980
He's a very serious composer.
 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:38.800
He takes everything very
seriously.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.512
I think I put on your sheet
there--did I or did I not?--the

00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:43.009
kinds of things that he wrote.
 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.023
Yes, I did: four symphonies,
two piano concertos,

00:04:47.023 --> 00:04:49.781
a violin concerto,
many overtures,

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.209
many songs, much great chamber
music.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:55.742
If you're a violinist and you
get rather advanced,

00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:58.329
you can play the beautiful,
beautiful Brahms violin

00:04:58.329 --> 00:04:58.949
sonatas.
 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.019
If you're a cellist and you get
reasonably advanced,

00:05:02.019 --> 00:05:04.610
you can play the beautiful
cello sonatas.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.600
So he wrote a lot of really
great chamber music.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.834
Oddly, he wrote no program
music--and we'll talk about that

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:13.485
a little bit later on,
what program music is--and he

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:16.220
wrote no opera--
well, so a little bit

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.250
different, very much sort of
heavy-duty instrumental music.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.550
Well, let's talk about this
composition.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.129
It will not open the piece.
 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.500
It will be the second on the
concert.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.579
It won't open the
concert.

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.509
It'll be the second piece--a
set of variations on a theme by

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.509
Joseph Haydn.
 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.199
Well, the theme probably isn't
really by Joseph Haydn,

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.737
but when Brahms got it,
everybody thought it was by

00:05:38.737 --> 00:05:39.600
Joseph Haydn.
 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.930
It's probably just a religious
folk song in honor of Saint

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.560
Anthony, but that's neither here
nor there.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.649
The shape of this song,
or theme, that Brahms is

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:54.610
working with here is one that
we're very familiar with.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.769
Now instead of putting A B C
B--I could have done that up

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:02.410
here--I'm going to flesh this
out a little bit.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.255
We're going to call this
Antecedent, Consequent,

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.709
Extension, Consequent.
 

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:11.720
But it's the same form that we
saw in the Beethoven "Ode

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.480
to Joy" so it's a familiar
organization for a musical

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.896
theme--
opening, closing,

00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:22.069
extension, and then closing
again,

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:27.069
and in this particular set of
variations Brahms will do this,

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.079
which of course is our--what
sign again?

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.870
Repeat sign.
 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.250
So he's going to repeat each of
these two sections.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.738
Actually, Beethoven did that to
some extent in the "Ode to

00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:38.639
Joy" too.
 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.944
So he's got this very
straightforward theme with that

00:06:41.944 --> 00:06:43.089
particular form.
 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.738
Let's listen to the theme,
and we'll try to pick up where

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:49.932
the antecedent concludes,
and where the consequent

00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:50.649
begins.
 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:53.132
Oh, and before that,
we could plug in other

00:06:53.132 --> 00:06:53.959
information.
 

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:54.670
What's the meter?
 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.040
Ask yourself as you listen
what's the meter of this,

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.620
what's the mode--major or
minor?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.077
What is the bass doing,
what string technique is the

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:03.569
bass employing here?
 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:27.100
&gt;
 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.980
Okay. That's the consequent.
 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.949
Now he's going to repeat it.
 

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:34.060
 
 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.346
&gt;
 

00:07:38.346 --> 00:07:41.598
Here's the antecedent.
 

00:07:41.598 --> 00:07:46.180
&gt;
 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:08:00.120
Here is the consequent,
&gt;

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.019
extension, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:08:03.019 --> 00:08:05.045
rising melodic sequence.
 

00:08:05.045 --> 00:08:07.579
&gt;
 

00:08:07.579 --> 00:08:12.505
Now he's going to bring it back
down--descending melodic

00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:16.088
sequence &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:08:16.088 --> 00:08:20.704
and the consequent.
 

00:08:20.704 --> 00:08:27.990
&gt;
 

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.252
Okay.
 

00:08:28.252 --> 00:08:28.884
Let's pause.
 

00:08:28.884 --> 00:08:30.829
We're just going to pause it
there.

00:08:30.829 --> 00:08:33.419
At this point,
what he does is take that

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:34.815
&gt;
 

00:08:34.815 --> 00:08:38.135
, that tonic pitch,
and extend it for a long period

00:08:38.135 --> 00:08:39.000
of time.
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.440
And it's down in the bass;
it's being held.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.662
This is a device that derives
from organ technique where an

00:08:43.662 --> 00:08:47.162
organist would just put his foot
or her foot on a particular key

00:08:47.162 --> 00:08:50.328
and just hold it for a long time
so we call it "pedal

00:08:50.328 --> 00:08:51.330
point."
 

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.626
So what Brahms is doing here is
sort of extending this tonic

00:08:54.626 --> 00:08:56.639
harmony by means of a pedal
point.

00:08:56.639 --> 00:09:05.049
So let's listen to this,
&gt;

00:09:05.049 --> 00:09:08.700
&gt;
 

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:14.447
--but now we have got to repeat
I believe &gt;

00:09:14.447 --> 00:09:20.288
so we're back to the extension,
&gt;

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:31.943
going up the sequence,
now back down,

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:41.980
&gt;
 

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:50.731
and here is the pedal point.
 

00:09:50.731 --> 00:10:00.110
&gt;
 

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:03.389
Okay. So that's the theme.
 

00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:05.658
It's rather straightforward and
really quite lovely.

00:10:05.658 --> 00:10:09.658
The solo instrument there of
course was an oboe,

00:10:09.658 --> 00:10:11.190
solo oboe there.
 

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.230
So now we're going to go on.
 

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.089
We're not going to go through
all these variations on your

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:14.350
sheet.
 

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.538
What about these timings here?
 

00:10:16.538 --> 00:10:19.580
Can you come in with a stop
clock and have your--

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:23.910
or watch or it set in a way
that at two minutes and nineteen

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.730
seconds you expect the first
variation to come in?

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.110
Is that going to work?
 

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.759
Oscar, why won't that work?
 

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:33.423
Student: Because a
conductor might interpret

00:10:33.423 --> 00:10:36.395
things--
Prof: A conductor might

00:10:36.395 --> 00:10:39.340
interpret things his or her own
way.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.969
We are going to have both a
male and female conductor on

00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:44.071
Saturday night,
so yeah, exactly,

00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:48.013
because different conductors
have different ideas about

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:48.668
tempo.
 

00:10:48.668 --> 00:10:50.743
Brahms would write
"allegro assai"

00:10:50.743 --> 00:10:51.779
or something like that.
 

00:10:51.779 --> 00:10:54.490
It's "rather fast,"
but how fast is rather fast?

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.197
So there are not precise
indications so these times are

00:10:57.197 --> 00:11:00.307
approximate here but they give
you a sense of when things might

00:11:00.307 --> 00:11:00.860
happen.
 

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.860
So we're going to go on now to
variation five,

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.724
I believe, which is at eight
minutes and thirty-six seconds

00:11:07.724 --> 00:11:11.207
or an approximation thereof,
and here we're going to give

00:11:11.207 --> 00:11:14.096
you maybe the most difficult of
all the variations for the

00:11:14.096 --> 00:11:15.159
orchestra to play.
 

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:17.559
It's very disjunct rhythmically.
 

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:19.250
They're not all together.
 

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.730
It's very contrapuntal.
 

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:23.668
Counterpoint is always harder
to play in an orchestra than

00:11:23.668 --> 00:11:26.815
homophony because every-- we've
got all these things that have

00:11:26.815 --> 00:11:27.950
to be coordinated.
 

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.048
So let's listen to this.
 

00:11:30.048 --> 00:11:34.472
If things seem muddled and
unclear in a performance of this

00:11:34.472 --> 00:11:37.378
piece,
my guess is it's--it may well

00:11:37.378 --> 00:11:39.908
happen here,
but let's listen just to a

00:11:39.908 --> 00:11:43.105
little bit to show you how
difficult and how far away from

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:44.620
the theme Brahms can go.
 

00:11:44.620 --> 00:12:16.720
&gt;
 

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.350
Okay. So we'll stop it there.
 

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.855
So it's hard for me even to
get--in terms of the rhythm

00:12:20.855 --> 00:12:23.735
there--to be actually sure where
the beat is because there's so

00:12:23.735 --> 00:12:24.710
much syncopation.
 

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.206
I think that's a very fast
one-two with a triple

00:12:28.206 --> 00:12:31.818
subdivision underneath,
but again the point there may

00:12:31.818 --> 00:12:33.615
be, "Gee,
I didn't remember

00:12:33.615 --> 00:12:35.990
hearing--"
&gt;.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:37.259
"Where'd that theme go?
 

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:38.450
That was hard to hear."
 

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.293
Well, he was varying it so much
that he's pretty much totally

00:12:42.293 --> 00:12:44.600
disguised the theme at that
point.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:52.178
Let's go on now to listen to a
little bit of variation seven at

00:12:52.178 --> 00:12:54.990
11:03 or thereabouts.
 

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:58.955
This is my favorite variation,
but let's listen to a bit of it

00:12:58.955 --> 00:13:00.840
and see if you like it too.
 

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:14.110
&gt;
 

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.668
And there's the A section.
 

00:13:15.668 --> 00:13:17.470
&gt;
 

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:36.240
Here comes C,
&gt;

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.162
back to A.
 

00:13:38.162 --> 00:13:43.929
&gt;
 

00:13:43.929 --> 00:13:47.110
Okay. Let's pause it there.
 

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:48.769
Now what am I doing up here?
 

00:13:48.769 --> 00:13:49.779
What is this?
 

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:52.125
Well, what I'm trying to do is
indicate what we call a

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:53.408
"compound meter."
 

00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:55.629
It's one of these where you
basically have a two,

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:58.808
but you have a triple
subdivision, and the conductors

00:13:58.808 --> 00:14:00.150
if it--
if that two is slow

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.594
enough--might go "one,
two, three, four,

00:14:02.594 --> 00:14:04.700
five, six,"
"one,

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.445
two, three, four,
five, six,"

00:14:06.445 --> 00:14:08.190
so it'll be interesting to see.
 

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:12.216
Maybe we should ask the
conductor on Thursday how he or

00:14:12.216 --> 00:14:14.140
she--
I forget who is conducting

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.475
exactly which pieces here--
how he or she is going to

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:20.144
conduct that,
whether he's going to do it

00:14:20.144 --> 00:14:21.370
&gt;
 

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:24.754
, a very slow two like that,
or are we going to really show

00:14:24.754 --> 00:14:25.980
the subdivisions.
 

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.775
If he's showing the
subdivisions,

00:14:27.775 --> 00:14:31.090
that's probably a suggestion
that maybe he doesn't have--

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.432
or she doesn't have quite as
much confidence in the orchestra

00:14:34.432 --> 00:14:37.662
and wants to really show that
beat very clearly rather than

00:14:37.662 --> 00:14:39.562
with--
working with a very experienced

00:14:39.562 --> 00:14:42.120
group where you can just kind of
give the large patterns and

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.940
they'll be able to put it all
together.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:48.070
 
 

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:51.360
We are now at this spot.
 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.154
We're going to have the
extension, and it's kind of fun

00:14:54.154 --> 00:14:56.070
to watch what Brahms is doing
here.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.761
Brahms is obsessed with rhythm
and it drives you nuts when

00:14:59.761 --> 00:15:02.028
you're a performer of this
stuff.

00:15:02.028 --> 00:15:04.428
One, he is obsessed with
variation;

00:15:04.428 --> 00:15:05.740
and two, he's obsessed with
rhythm.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.298
He will change things even when
he doesn't need to change

00:15:08.298 --> 00:15:08.710
things.
 

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:12.965
I remember accompanying my last
child in the Brahms Cello Sonata

00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:16.951
and I would have to continually
change hand positions for no

00:15:16.951 --> 00:15:19.082
good reason,
which is kind of

00:15:19.082 --> 00:15:22.895
arbitrary--that he wanted maybe
just a slightly different sound

00:15:22.895 --> 00:15:25.636
whereas the sound before,
that Beethoven would have been

00:15:25.636 --> 00:15:27.226
satisfied with,
and Mozart would have been

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:30.500
satisfied with,
wouldn't suffice for him.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.360
So, he's obsessed with
variation and he's obsessed with

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.881
rhythm,
and as we listen to this

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.620
passage we will see the basic
"one,

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:38.513
two, three, four,
five, six,"

00:15:38.513 --> 00:15:40.235
"one,
two, three, four,

00:15:40.235 --> 00:15:42.586
five, six,"
and then suddenly he will

00:15:42.586 --> 00:15:43.984
change it,
"one, two,"

00:15:43.984 --> 00:15:45.370
"three,
four," "five,

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.440
six," "one,
two," "three,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.399
four," "five,
six," "one,

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:51.279
two," "three,
four," "five,

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.450
six," emphasizing this way.
 

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:56.480
That in music is called hemiola.
 

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.773
There's probably some kind of
Greek root there having to do

00:15:59.773 --> 00:16:01.080
with twos and threes.
 

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:05.110
I'm not really sure,
but as you can see we've

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:10.058
got--what we had was,
in effect, two units of three.

00:16:10.058 --> 00:16:13.460
Now we've got three units of
two.

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:17.211
I remember in Leonard
Bernstein--I don't know whether

00:16:17.211 --> 00:16:21.539
it's West Side Story or
not, &gt;.

00:16:21.539 --> 00:16:22.399
What is that from?
 

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.330
Student: West Side
Story.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.484
Prof: Is it from West
Side Story?

00:16:24.484 --> 00:16:24.658
Okay.
 

00:16:24.658 --> 00:16:27.070
So that's a good example of
hemiola too.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.216
I think it's called
"America"

00:16:28.216 --> 00:16:28.970
or something like that.
 

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:32.591
So that's what hemiola is--when
you're rolling in one of these

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:35.798
and you suddenly shift to the
other, back and forth.

00:16:35.798 --> 00:16:41.340
So let's listen to this lovely
six become three groups of two.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:58.139
&gt;
 

00:16:58.139 --> 00:17:00.417
--one, two, three,
four, five ,

00:17:00.417 --> 00:17:02.770
one two, three,
four, five, six,

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:05.200
one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:05.960
one.
 

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.308
Let's do that again.
 

00:17:07.308 --> 00:17:10.869
It took me a while to find the
sixth beat there.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.869
So go back and--a little before.
 

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:19.079
&gt;
 

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.779
So here is E.
 

00:17:20.779 --> 00:17:35.818
&gt;
 

00:17:35.818 --> 00:17:38.404
--three, four,
five, six, one,

00:17:38.404 --> 00:17:39.758
two,
three,

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.160
four, five,
six,

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.210
one, two, three,
four, five,

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.298
six, and then he goes back,
four, five,

00:17:48.298 --> 00:17:50.807
six, one, two,
three, four,

00:17:50.807 --> 00:17:51.868
five six.
 

00:17:51.868 --> 00:17:52.202
Okay.
 

00:17:52.202 --> 00:17:55.604
Well, that's just a little
rhythmic filip there with

00:17:55.604 --> 00:17:59.605
Brahms, but it's the kind of
thing that keeps interest in his

00:17:59.605 --> 00:18:00.338
music.
 

00:18:00.338 --> 00:18:02.818
Now we're going to go on to the
last variation,

00:18:02.818 --> 00:18:05.729
and it's an interesting one
because it's got two things

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:06.700
going on here.
 

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.527
He's got a theme and then he's
got what we call an ostinato in

00:18:10.527 --> 00:18:11.028
music.
 

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:13.616
Anybody remember--I think we've
bumped into this term

00:18:13.616 --> 00:18:15.109
before--what an ostinato is?
 

00:18:15.109 --> 00:18:19.220
What does an ostinato do? Roger.
 

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.250
Student:
&gt;

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.202
Prof: Good.
 

00:18:21.202 --> 00:18:23.960
That's it exactly--from the
Italian obstinare,

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.140
obstinate-- and it just repeats
the same phrase over and over

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.200
and over again.
 

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.472
So what he's got here
repeating, oddly,

00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:31.490
is in the bass.
 

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:38.009
&gt;
 

00:18:38.009 --> 00:18:42.355
There's his tonic.
 

00:18:42.355 --> 00:18:49.358
&gt;
 

00:18:49.358 --> 00:18:53.616
And that just keeps repeating
over and over and over,

00:18:53.616 --> 00:18:58.529
above which we have a very
distant variation of the theme.

00:18:58.529 --> 00:19:01.799
It doesn't sound like the theme
very much, so let's listen to

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:04.690
the ostinato and this highly
varied theme up above.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:19.069
&gt;
 

00:19:19.069 --> 00:19:22.318
Can you hear the bass?
 

00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:30.146
&gt;
 

00:19:30.146 --> 00:19:41.329
&gt;
 

00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:42.720
Let's pause it there.
 

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:45.150
Notice also--
&gt;

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.910
What's he throwing in against
his basic beat?

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.817
&gt;
 

00:19:50.817 --> 00:19:53.450
What--what's that?
 

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:54.630
We've talked about it before.
 

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.250
We're coming on
&gt;

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:01.942
one, two, one and two and one
and two and

00:20:01.942 --> 00:20:05.359
&gt;.
 

00:20:05.359 --> 00:20:06.809
What's that?
 

00:20:06.809 --> 00:20:08.009
Triplets? Okay?
 

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:09.640
So we talked about that before.
 

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.964
So here he's making this more
complicated rhythmically by not

00:20:12.964 --> 00:20:15.736
only using hemiola and
syncopation, but also threes

00:20:15.736 --> 00:20:17.509
against twos simultaneously.
 

00:20:17.509 --> 00:20:19.828
He's throwing in some triplets
in the melody up above.

00:20:19.828 --> 00:20:20.065
Okay.
 

00:20:20.065 --> 00:20:21.569
Let's continue just a bit more.
 

00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:54.910
&gt;
 

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:58.138
So at this point you say,
"What the heck happened to

00:20:58.138 --> 00:20:58.657
my theme?
 

00:20:58.657 --> 00:21:00.618
I--" &gt;
 

00:21:00.618 --> 00:21:02.130
"I don't remember that at
all.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.830
I've--"
We've sort of lost track of

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.450
that as this ostinato bass keeps
grinding away underneath.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:10.320
But gradually what he does is
take that ostinato and move it

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.192
up in to the upper part of the
register of the orchestra and

00:21:14.192 --> 00:21:18.130
then gradually make this
transform back into the theme,

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:21.019
sort of magically transform
itself back into the theme.

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:26.970
 
 

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:32.098
&gt;
 

00:21:32.098 --> 00:21:42.006
It sounds very confused,
but if you listen to the upper

00:21:42.006 --> 00:21:52.828
register you can hear the--
&gt;

00:21:52.828 --> 00:21:55.220
--and then &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:13.778
the theme is coming back in the
upper woodwinds,

00:22:13.778 --> 00:22:26.019
&gt;
 

00:22:26.019 --> 00:22:35.200
on pedal point.
 

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.604
Okay.
 

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:40.128
So now you think the piece is
over, slowing the tempo way

00:22:40.128 --> 00:22:43.200
down, &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:55.000
the sound diminishes,
could end it right here.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.130
&gt;
 

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.782
And that last little bit at the
end, of course,

00:23:04.782 --> 00:23:05.900
is called the--
Student: Coda.

00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:07.308
Prof: Coda, right. Okay?
 

00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:10.323
So he--once again with theme
and variations if you don't give

00:23:10.323 --> 00:23:12.634
the audience a coda,
they're expecting the next

00:23:12.634 --> 00:23:13.788
variation to begin.
 

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:16.640
So you got to throw in that
coda so that everybody knows,

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.829
hey, that really was the
end--no fooling.

00:23:18.829 --> 00:23:20.440
Questions about that?
 

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.695
So that's Brahms's
Variations on a Theme by

00:23:22.695 --> 00:23:25.642
Haydn and it's--
I can't say it's a beautiful

00:23:25.642 --> 00:23:29.588
piece but it's a very serious
piece but it's a good piece for

00:23:29.588 --> 00:23:30.048
you.
 

00:23:30.048 --> 00:23:31.808
This is a very serious group
this year.

00:23:31.808 --> 00:23:33.917
I'm impressed with the
seriousness with which you show

00:23:33.917 --> 00:23:35.348
up here and that you take this
I--

00:23:35.348 --> 00:23:38.435
sometimes I see that you're
actually much more interested in

00:23:38.435 --> 00:23:41.680
the classical stuff that we're
doing than in the pop stuff,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.970
which is not always the case
over the years,

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.869
working with Yale
undergraduates.

00:23:45.869 --> 00:23:47.680
Okay. A question.
 

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.588
Yes, Daniel.
 

00:23:49.588 --> 00:23:51.957
Student: Is his
variation theme always on an A B

00:23:51.957 --> 00:23:52.220
C B?
 

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.496
Prof: Yes.
 

00:23:53.496 --> 00:23:57.251
One--however disguised it is,
how--the question is:

00:23:57.251 --> 00:24:01.910
is the framework of the theme
always this A B C B business?

00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.451
No matter how far he goes
melodically from the original

00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:09.386
pattern and how complex in terms
of counterpoint and rhythmic

00:24:09.386 --> 00:24:13.912
permutations he becomes,
it still is dropped within this

00:24:13.912 --> 00:24:18.127
same framework of the A B C B--
although admittedly it's pretty

00:24:18.127 --> 00:24:19.539
difficult to hear sometimes.
 

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:21.160
Yeah, David.
 

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:21.799
Student: Michael.
 

00:24:21.799 --> 00:24:22.578
Prof: Michael. Sorry.
 

00:24:22.578 --> 00:24:24.490
Student: That's what
Brahms &gt;

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.730
Prof: That--I--that is
just with this piece here.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.435
You can work with other
composers, Rachmanioff's

00:24:30.435 --> 00:24:32.970
Variations on a theme of
Pagainif,

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.963
for example where the length of
the variations will become very

00:24:35.963 --> 00:24:38.912
different and it'll be--
it won't be sort of,

00:24:38.912 --> 00:24:42.900
as I like to say,
boxcar-like as this arrangement.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:47.284
This is still boxcar-like even
though it's very diversified in

00:24:47.284 --> 00:24:50.588
terms of what's put in and on
those boxcars.

00:24:50.588 --> 00:24:53.308
Two good questions there.
 

00:24:53.308 --> 00:24:54.180
Thanks.
 

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.977
All right.
 

00:24:54.977 --> 00:24:59.042
Having finished theme and
variations for the moment,

00:24:59.042 --> 00:25:02.392
let's go on to talk about
rondo, r-o-n-d-o,

00:25:02.392 --> 00:25:03.269
rondo.
 

00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.920
Is that really true?
 

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.269
Well, it goes by a couple of
different names.

00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:09.690
The English call it rondo form.
 

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.701
The Germans call it rondo form
and Mozart wrote--and I've

00:25:12.701 --> 00:25:15.336
looked at a lot of his
autographs--wanted to write

00:25:15.336 --> 00:25:17.380
rondo and he spelled it
r-o-n-d-o.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.301
Si nous allions en France,
on y va dire

00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:23.909
"rondeau"--
"C'est une rondeau,

00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:26.073
monsieur"--
but if you go to Italy they

00:25:26.073 --> 00:25:28.329
would call it the
"ritornello."

00:25:28.329 --> 00:25:30.240
Locciamo ritornello.
 

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:33.840
I love--these Latinate
languages are so wonderful,

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.634
aren't they,
the way they play with the

00:25:36.634 --> 00:25:38.839
vowels--ritornello.
 

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:40.190
So it's the same idea.
 

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:41.786
A rondo,
a rondeau,

00:25:41.786 --> 00:25:44.328
and a ritornello,
it's the same principle.

00:25:44.328 --> 00:25:47.939
And oddly the principle
develops right out of the thing

00:25:47.939 --> 00:25:51.816
that we were talking about and
that Frederick introduced us

00:25:51.816 --> 00:25:54.288
to--the idea of verse and
chorus.

00:25:54.288 --> 00:25:58.501
Because what's involved here is
really one musical concept--one

00:25:58.501 --> 00:26:01.900
big theme coming back again and
again and again.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.330
And this goes all the way back
to the Middle Ages where they

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:08.938
would have soloists singing new
verses and then everybody would

00:26:08.938 --> 00:26:11.327
sing the chorus,
and the thing that we all

00:26:11.327 --> 00:26:12.450
remember is the chorus.
 

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.730
That's the big-ticket item.
 

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.288
That's the thing that everybody
is doing.

00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:18.144
So that's the thing that keeps
coming back again and again and

00:26:18.144 --> 00:26:18.519
again.
 

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:21.715
So this, in an odd way,
I think is the easiest of these

00:26:21.715 --> 00:26:22.900
forms to remember.
 

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.115
If you hear some music where
you get music and then something

00:26:26.115 --> 00:26:29.328
else and then hit in the face
with that same music again,

00:26:29.328 --> 00:26:31.414
then something else,
and then you get hit in the

00:26:31.414 --> 00:26:34.211
face with that same music again
and then something else and then

00:26:34.211 --> 00:26:36.519
the same music again that's
probably rondo form.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:39.436
And you can give it these
different names in different

00:26:39.436 --> 00:26:42.463
languages but the idea is the
same and as I suggest it's

00:26:42.463 --> 00:26:43.288
primordial.
 

00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:47.118
I think on your sheet to show
you how primordial it is,

00:26:47.118 --> 00:26:49.397
I even gave you the text of a
rondo by Guillaume Du Fay

00:26:49.397 --> 00:26:51.803
(1397-1474) that goes all the
way back in to the fifteenth

00:26:51.803 --> 00:26:52.308
century.
 

00:26:52.308 --> 00:26:55.785
We don't have to go back that
far and you can see we'll end up

00:26:55.785 --> 00:26:59.259
today with a rondo by Sting so
this has been around for a long

00:26:59.259 --> 00:27:02.210
time--
this particular form.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:06.027
Let's--yeah--have an
introduction to it by listening

00:27:06.027 --> 00:27:10.368
to a reasonably well-known piece
by Jean-Joseph Mouret,

00:27:10.368 --> 00:27:14.320
who was a composer in residence
at the court of King Louis the

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.832
Fifteenth at Versailles,
and in Paris,

00:27:16.832 --> 00:27:19.528
in the early years of the
eighteenth century.

00:27:19.528 --> 00:27:22.563
You probably know this music
because for years it was the

00:27:22.563 --> 00:27:25.162
background theme of the
introductory material for

00:27:25.162 --> 00:27:28.250
"Masterpiece Theatre"
on public television.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.009
So let's listen to a bit of
this.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:35.540
And let me take this material
off and we'll chart here and

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.880
I'll ask you what the meter of
this is--

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.460
what the meter--and how many
measures of our refrain--

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.421
our main theme,
what we'll call "A"

00:27:46.421 --> 00:27:49.105
here--
how many measures we have in

00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:49.950
our theme.
 

00:27:49.950 --> 00:28:05.200
&gt;
 

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.130
Two. Okay.
 

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:18.809
&gt;
 

00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:20.230
Okay. Let's stop it there.
 

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:21.579
So what'd you think about that?
 

00:28:21.579 --> 00:28:22.319
What's the meter?
 

00:28:22.319 --> 00:28:24.200
Well, I kind of gave that away.
 

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.390
Sometimes when you listen to
music you can't stop yourself.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.349
It's like the end of
"Doctor Strangelove."

00:28:28.349 --> 00:28:29.358
Did you ever see that movie?
 

00:28:29.358 --> 00:28:35.078
So yeah, it's a piece in duple
meter.

00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:37.680
How many measures did we have
in our theme?

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.490
How many measures did we count
there?

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:43.261
Well, listen to it--let's
listen to it again,

00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:47.119
right back to the beginning I
guess, Lynda.

00:28:47.119 --> 00:29:00.200
&gt;
 

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.319
So what do you think?
 

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:02.740
Eight? All right.
 

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.019
Let's put eight up here and
let's listen again now.

00:29:06.019 --> 00:29:07.609
Just continue, please.
 

00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:20.358
&gt;
 

00:29:20.358 --> 00:29:21.779
And we're going to stop it
there.

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:22.759
We had how many there?
 

00:29:22.759 --> 00:29:23.160
Student: Eight.
 

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:23.808
Prof: Eight again.
 

00:29:23.808 --> 00:29:26.440
So everything is always fours
and eights in music?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:27.298
No, not exactly.
 

00:29:27.298 --> 00:29:29.818
If you start--we're counting
measures there in the Brahms.

00:29:29.818 --> 00:29:33.750
His theme sometimes has five
measures in those sections,

00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:37.269
but this one happens to be
different and more common--

00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:39.847
eight plus eight,
and actually in reality here

00:29:39.847 --> 00:29:43.000
this is just slightly different
than the first eight.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.039
The ending of it is slightly
different from the first eight.

00:29:45.039 --> 00:29:45.990
So there we are.
 

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.561
We've got our refrain or our
theme in place,

00:29:48.561 --> 00:29:49.578
our big A idea.
 

00:29:49.578 --> 00:29:53.220
Now let's go on to the next
material.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:30:08.190
&gt;
 

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.210
Let's stop it there.
 

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:10.720
How many bars did we have there?
 

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.960
Well, eight again. Okay?
 

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:17.420
So we could call the--,
&gt;

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.519
a different sort of rhythm
there.

00:30:18.519 --> 00:30:22.278
We could call this a B idea or
we could even call it an X,

00:30:22.278 --> 00:30:26.170
the--something different,
and that lasted for eight bars.

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.277
Back it up just a couple
of--Lynda if you would,

00:30:28.277 --> 00:30:30.922
please, so we can get back in
to that B and then we'll go on

00:30:30.922 --> 00:30:31.730
to the next A.
 

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:36.970
&gt;
 

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.289
That's okay.
 

00:30:38.289 --> 00:30:38.589
&gt;
 

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:40.769
So here we are with our B.
 

00:30:40.769 --> 00:31:04.160
&gt;
 

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.308
Okay. Let's stop it there.
 

00:31:07.308 --> 00:31:09.349
So what happened to our A this
time?

00:31:09.349 --> 00:31:10.190
How long was it?
 

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.559
It was still eight.
 

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:13.480
Did we get it again, though?
 

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:13.795
No.
 

00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:17.269
We got just one statement of
it.

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:18.618
Why didn't we get it again?
 

00:31:18.618 --> 00:31:21.269
Well, maybe he didn't need to
give it to us again.

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:23.815
Ever watch television
commercials when they first come

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:26.553
on, and then what happens to
these commercials a couple of

00:31:26.553 --> 00:31:27.369
months later?
 

00:31:27.369 --> 00:31:28.650
What do they do?
 

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:29.250
&gt;
 

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.278
Yeah, they shorten them.
 

00:31:31.278 --> 00:31:33.586
They'll run a sixty-minute
version of it,

00:31:33.586 --> 00:31:34.970
then a--sixty minutes.
 

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.680
That'd be interminable.
 

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.818
A sixty-second version,
then a thirty-second version.

00:31:38.818 --> 00:31:40.608
You
psychologically--subliminally,

00:31:40.608 --> 00:31:43.430
you'll--you're filling in the
missing information.

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:45.159
So keep an eye out for that
kind of thing,

00:31:45.159 --> 00:31:46.338
and composers do that too.
 

00:31:46.338 --> 00:31:48.233
They know it,
well, we've heard this a fair

00:31:48.233 --> 00:31:48.640
amount.
 

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.404
Well, we'll give the
psychological force of the whole

00:31:52.404 --> 00:31:55.880
thing but really just give it to
them in half.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.680
Okay.
 

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.849
 
 

00:32:01.849 --> 00:32:12.140
&gt;
 

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:14.079
Okay. Here we got to count now.
 

00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:14.529
&gt;
 

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:17.099
Two, two, three, two, four .
 

00:32:17.099 --> 00:32:45.109
&gt;
 

00:32:45.109 --> 00:32:48.309
So let's pause there.
 

00:32:48.309 --> 00:32:49.670
How long was that section?
 

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:50.568
Student: Twenty?
 

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:51.218
Prof: Twenty.
 

00:32:51.218 --> 00:32:52.029
Yeah, twenty bars there.
 

00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:54.588
It was a long run of other
material.

00:32:54.588 --> 00:32:57.829
And then as you can hear here
our A theme is coming back.

00:32:57.829 --> 00:32:59.509
Let's see if we get it repeated.
 

00:32:59.509 --> 00:33:00.640
Just continue.
 

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:28.299
&gt;
 

00:33:28.299 --> 00:33:30.799
Was there a coda there?
 

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.940
No.
 

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:37.201
How did this particular group
of performers make the piece

00:33:37.201 --> 00:33:39.369
sound as if it were ending?
 

00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:43.500
Daniel or Angela is it?
 

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:44.910
Yeah.
 

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.210
Student:
&gt;

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.118
Prof: He retarded--
&gt;

00:33:49.118 --> 00:33:51.788
--slowed it way down,
so you know,

00:33:51.788 --> 00:33:55.186
that's another way of getting a
sense of end here rather than

00:33:55.186 --> 00:33:58.527
throwing on some extra bricks to
say the thing has concluded

00:33:58.527 --> 00:33:59.490
harmonically.
 

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:01.450
All right. So that's one rondo.
 

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.380
Let's go on to a more
sophisticated rondo.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.720
We're going to go on to one by
Vivaldi here.

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.409
Now this is in ritornello form
as you'll see when you read the

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:12.949
textbook, but the principle is
the same.

00:34:12.949 --> 00:34:16.309
We have a theme that keeps
coming back again and again and

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:18.489
again, and you all know this
theme.

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:21.902
You've probably heard it at
Starbucks or Au bon Pain eight

00:34:21.902 --> 00:34:22.740
zillion times.
 

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:23.280
Right?
 

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.510
Anybody sing it?
 

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:27.719
Anybody remember what the
Vivaldi "Spring

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.789
Concerto"
sounds like?

00:34:29.789 --> 00:34:30.114
Okay.
 

00:34:30.114 --> 00:34:33.237
Angela's on a roll this morning
so nice and loud.

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.670
Don't be shy there.
 

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:39.659
Student:
&gt;

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:42.469
Prof: Good.
 

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.250
Okay.
 

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.840
&gt;
 

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:53.050
Then we have a second idea,
&gt;

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.199
so here it's kind of our main
theme here,

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:59.143
really kind of two ideas,
A and B, but we're going to

00:34:59.143 --> 00:35:02.427
just for the sake of argument
here just call this "big

00:35:02.427 --> 00:35:03.163
A" here.
 

00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:03.730
Okay.
 

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:06.630
So that's the theme so let's
listen to a bit of this.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.255
Well, no.
 

00:35:07.255 --> 00:35:11.637
We don't even have to listen to
this because Angela has given us

00:35:11.637 --> 00:35:12.889
the ritornello.
 

00:35:12.889 --> 00:35:16.389
So let's go on to the first X
here.

00:35:16.389 --> 00:35:20.280
We've got something else coming
in, and it's Vivaldi's attempt

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:24.170
to write birds chirping away on
a beautiful spring morning.

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.829
So let's listen to the birds
here.

00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:32.190
&gt;
 

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:35.920
After the birds chirp,
we get our A coming back so

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.889
let's listen to our A come back
here.

00:35:38.889 --> 00:35:46.239
&gt;
 

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:46.577
Okay.
 

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:50.286
So now we're taking a walk
through a beautiful forest in

00:35:50.286 --> 00:35:54.264
this spring day and we see a
babbling brook and the brook is

00:35:54.264 --> 00:35:56.391
foaming,
surging away,

00:35:56.391 --> 00:35:59.119
so that's what we've got here.
 

00:35:59.119 --> 00:36:01.210
&gt;
 

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:15.989
&gt;
 

00:36:15.989 --> 00:36:18.668
So what was that that we just
heard?

00:36:18.668 --> 00:36:20.429
&gt;
 

00:36:20.429 --> 00:36:22.599
Was that something else or was
that our ritornello?

00:36:22.599 --> 00:36:25.518
Jerry, nice and loud.
 

00:36:25.518 --> 00:36:26.159
Student:
&gt;

00:36:26.159 --> 00:36:27.224
Prof: Okay.
 

00:36:27.224 --> 00:36:28.820
That was my next question.
 

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:29.610
You've jumped to it.
 

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:30.699
So it was the ritornello.
 

00:36:30.699 --> 00:36:35.001
And my next question is:
but what was different about

00:36:35.001 --> 00:36:36.489
that ritornello?
 

00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:41.900
Well, the first time we had it
&gt;.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.250
Now we're getting
&gt;.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.679
It's in a lower key so we've
had a modulation.

00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:50.300
This is actually down on the
dominant.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.610
We don't need to know that.
 

00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:53.637
We don't need to know whether
it's tonic or dominant,

00:36:53.637 --> 00:36:56.016
but I think it would be good if
we heard that as just a little

00:36:56.016 --> 00:36:56.719
bit different.
 

00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:00.237
It's lower, maybe a little
darker than the brighter sound

00:37:00.237 --> 00:37:00.929
up above.
 

00:37:00.929 --> 00:37:03.760
So we had that and now let's
see what happens.

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.365
Doesn't a storm come up and
sort of threaten us here in the

00:37:06.365 --> 00:37:07.219
beautiful forest?
 

00:37:07.219 --> 00:37:12.639
&gt;
 

00:37:12.639 --> 00:37:14.000
Lots of tremolo,
lots of agitation,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.239
&gt;
 

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:33.199
&gt;
 

00:37:33.199 --> 00:37:34.320
Now what happens?
 

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:42.090
&gt;
 

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:43.889
Okay. We'll stop there.
 

00:37:43.889 --> 00:37:47.101
Yes, that was our ritornello
coming back--our theme coming

00:37:47.101 --> 00:37:48.960
back--but how was it different?
 

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.380
Okay. Yeah, it was in minor.
 

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.128
&gt;
 

00:37:53.128 --> 00:37:55.460
&gt;
 

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.400
So it had changed key again.
 

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:59.739
And again, we don't need to
know what key it went to.

00:37:59.739 --> 00:38:02.759
If you were a betting man in
Las Vegas or a betting woman in

00:38:02.759 --> 00:38:04.960
Las Vegas, what would you say it
went to?

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.527
The relative minor,
because about half of the time

00:38:08.527 --> 00:38:10.130
that's what they do.
 

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.460
And indeed in this particular
case it went just three half

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:15.210
steps down,
to the relative minor,

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.880
but hearing that it went to the
minor is all we're after here.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.268
So this was in a minor key here
and then on it goes.

00:38:21.268 --> 00:38:22.989
We needn't play this out to the
end.

00:38:22.989 --> 00:38:25.688
It gives you a sense of how
ritornello form can

00:38:25.688 --> 00:38:27.920
inform this particular
rondo.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.570
Let's turn to another one by
Mozart here.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.010
Yeah, I think we've got time
for that.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:39.670
Take this off.
 

00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:43.184
So it's a horn concerto by
Mozart written in the eighteen

00:38:43.184 --> 00:38:45.757
seventies,
and we're just going to start

00:38:45.757 --> 00:38:48.969
it out here and we're going to
hear the first theme.

00:38:48.969 --> 00:38:51.360
&gt;
 

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.873
It's the basis of Listening
Exercise twenty-six,

00:38:54.873 --> 00:38:57.639
which we'll get to in a week or
so.

00:38:57.639 --> 00:39:11.800
&gt;
 

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.670
Okay. Let's stop there.
 

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:16.099
Why is this an easy theme to
remember?

00:39:16.099 --> 00:39:24.289
Because it's full of
&gt;.

00:39:24.289 --> 00:39:26.106
It's a lot of notes right on
the same pitch,

00:39:26.106 --> 00:39:27.079
&gt;
 

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:30.170
and it actually starts dominant
&gt;

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.398
and sort of goes along like
that, so we keep a mental graph

00:39:33.398 --> 00:39:34.679
of this with our X's.
 

00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:37.050
Now, in a second--and then the
orchestra repeated this.

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:39.690
Then in a second,
the B theme is going to come in

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.780
and it's going to be very
different.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.489
&gt;
 

00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:48.889
What's that?
 

00:39:48.889 --> 00:39:50.909
Arpeggio. Okay?
 

00:39:50.909 --> 00:39:55.503
So instead of using repeated
pitches, we mark the B section

00:39:55.503 --> 00:39:58.909
of this by the use of lots of
leaps here.

00:39:58.909 --> 00:40:00.690
So we're going to have lots of
space between our Xs.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:02.340
&gt;
 

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:05.269
And then it's going to have a
couple of different motifs in

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:07.090
here, but they're all very
skippy;

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.389
they're all very disjunct.
 

00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:12.739
And it's these disjunct leaps
that mark the B section.

00:40:12.739 --> 00:40:13.889
So let's just continue.
 

00:40:13.889 --> 00:40:33.480
&gt;
 

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:35.050
More jumps.
 

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:52.170
&gt;
 

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.079
Now listen to the bass here.
 

00:40:54.079 --> 00:40:57.280
We've got another pedal point,
&gt;

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.940
sitting on the dominant,
&gt;

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.320
&gt;
 

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.179
What's this?
 

00:41:05.179 --> 00:41:05.909
&gt;
 

00:41:05.909 --> 00:41:08.559
This is our theme A coming back.
 

00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:17.268
&gt;
 

00:41:17.268 --> 00:41:17.525
Okay.
 

00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:19.010
We're going to stop it here.
 

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:22.110
So here we are at this
particular juncture.

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.480
Notice: each time the French
horn plays the theme;

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.920
then the orchestra repeats it.
 

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:29.750
Now as we go in to this section
we'll get a new theme.

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:34.639
It's C and it will be marked by
an interesting development.

00:41:34.639 --> 00:41:41.079
&gt;
 

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:43.079
What's happened to the mode?
 

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:48.150
&gt;
 

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:50.519
So what happened to the piece
there?

00:41:50.519 --> 00:41:55.090
&gt;
 

00:41:55.090 --> 00:42:00.268
Changed to minor--so we're
moving fast here.

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:01.809
We're doing all this in just
one hearing.

00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:05.510
So there we are--our C section
is marked by minor.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.710
So let's continue.
 

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.900
&gt;
 

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:15.070
Rising sequence here,
melodic sequence.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.789
&gt;
 

00:42:17.789 --> 00:42:21.170
Now falling sequence.
 

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:22.090
&gt;
 

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:27.860
Now a step lower &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:31.760
and a step lower yet again
&gt;

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:38.949
and then A snakes in,
&gt;

00:42:38.949 --> 00:42:46.039
repeated by the orchestra
&gt;

00:42:46.039 --> 00:42:50.039
and here come our jumps,
so we are back to B.

00:42:50.039 --> 00:43:23.050
&gt;
 

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.360
A little deceptive cadence
there.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.880
&gt;
 

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.610
Let's pause it right there.
 

00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:30.360
Sing the next pitch.
 

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.018
&gt;
 

00:43:31.018 --> 00:43:32.320
Not only &gt;
 

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:34.789
but that somebody started
singing &gt;.

00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:35.909
You know what's happening next.
 

00:43:35.909 --> 00:43:38.309
He's set you with this big,
long dominant pause

00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:39.510
&gt;
 

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:40.739
and off it goes.
 

00:43:40.739 --> 00:43:59.059
&gt;
 

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:02.271
Now this we--we have had our A
and the orchestral repeat of it,

00:44:02.271 --> 00:44:04.809
but we haven't heard this kind
of stuff before.

00:44:04.809 --> 00:44:07.086
What would you imagine's
going--what is this we're

00:44:07.086 --> 00:44:07.969
listening to now?
 

00:44:07.969 --> 00:44:11.405
Coda, I'm moving things along
here, so we have a coda and

00:44:11.405 --> 00:44:14.349
notice that down--I forget the
particular key.

00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:19.719
&gt;
 

00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:22.552
And Mozart is working through
the "Duke of Earl"

00:44:22.552 --> 00:44:24.940
harmony once again in this
particular section.

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.820
So let's listen to a bit of
that.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:39.010
&gt;
 

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:43.670
And this is just filler,
arpeggiatic filler here.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:45.460
&gt;
 

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.710
So that's our coda again to
show us that the piece is at an

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:50.150
end.
 

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.559
You can end your rondo in a
couple of ways,

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:55.485
but the point here is:
notice the form that has been

00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:58.239
created by Mozart and again,
it is timeless.

00:44:58.239 --> 00:45:01.740
I think we have time now to
show a slide,

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.280
and Jason isn't here today.
 

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.190
I wanted him to do this.
 

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:16.684
I think I can turn this on
myself though,

00:45:16.684 --> 00:45:32.949
and we're going to listen to--
&gt;

00:45:32.949 --> 00:45:33.293
Okay.
 

00:45:33.293 --> 00:45:35.909
So let's stop that just for a
moment.

00:45:35.909 --> 00:45:38.699
What do I have up here on the
board?

00:45:38.699 --> 00:45:40.099
Anybody ever seen this before?
 

00:45:40.099 --> 00:45:41.300
Anybody been there?
 

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.050
Where would you imagine it is?
 

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:49.789
In France at the Chateau de
Chambord, C-h-a-m-b-o-r-d.

00:45:49.789 --> 00:45:51.690
I took this leaning out of a
bus.

00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.159
And you can see over on the
left, we have one idea,

00:45:56.159 --> 00:46:00.449
the A idea, contrasting idea,
return to the A idea,

00:46:00.449 --> 00:46:03.420
a largely contrasting idea here
in the middle,

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:07.610
return to your central concept,
a contrast here that matches

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:11.559
this contrast over there,
and then the central idea at

00:46:11.559 --> 00:46:12.190
the end.
 

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.489
It's in--exactly in one of
these palindromic,

00:46:15.489 --> 00:46:18.286
A, B, A, C, A,
B, A form--the same thing that

00:46:18.286 --> 00:46:22.293
you get here in the Mozart horn
concerto and the same thing that

00:46:22.293 --> 00:46:25.916
Sting and the Police have
programmed into their particular

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:26.679
rondo.
 

00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:28.429
You've got the sheets on this.
 

00:46:28.429 --> 00:46:31.599
Maybe I'll turn the lights back
on 'cause we don't need to see

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:32.380
that anymore.
 

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:43.539
 
 

00:46:43.539 --> 00:46:47.460
So let's listen to--we--I'll
just tell you we've got this

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.510
initial idea.
 

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.239
&gt;
 

00:46:51.239 --> 00:46:54.449
Where is he--what key is he in?
 

00:46:54.449 --> 00:47:00.300
A-- &gt;
 

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.920
Once again I,
VI, IV, V, I,--"Duke of

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.606
Earl" stuff,
but interestingly enough,

00:47:05.606 --> 00:47:07.909
here &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:47:07.909 --> 00:47:09.599
--half the time he doesn't come
back.

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:10.867
&gt;
 

00:47:10.867 --> 00:47:12.463
He goes &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:13.449
, which is what?
 

00:47:13.449 --> 00:47:16.309
A deceptive cadence!
 

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:21.010
&gt;
 

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:25.585
So he alternates here between
authentic cadences and deceptive

00:47:25.585 --> 00:47:26.409
cadences.
 

00:47:26.409 --> 00:47:28.393
So we'll listen to a little bit
of it and if we run out of time

00:47:28.393 --> 00:47:28.969
then we'll stop.
 

00:47:28.969 --> 00:47:33.139
&gt;
 

00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:38.630
There's the VI, IV, V.
 

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:42.530
There's the VI deceptive
cadence.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.940
&gt;
 

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:48.842
I, VI, IV, V,
I.

00:47:48.842 --> 00:47:56.909
&gt;
 

00:47:56.909 --> 00:48:00.139
Yeah, we gotta stop it here or
the copyright people will be all

00:48:00.139 --> 00:48:00.659
over us.
 

00:48:00.659 --> 00:48:02.708
Then it goes on to the B
section, "Oh,

00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:04.755
can't you see,"
and for that we have a

00:48:04.755 --> 00:48:10.530
different chord,
&gt;

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:13.411
"That you belong to me,
my poor heart breaks,"

00:48:13.411 --> 00:48:14.670
&gt;.
 

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:15.083
Okay.
 

00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:17.489
We can continue to play now.
 

00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:20.349
&gt;
 

00:48:20.349 --> 00:48:21.769
That's this section.
 

00:48:21.769 --> 00:48:24.590
&gt;
 

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:25.219
All right.
 

00:48:25.219 --> 00:48:27.239
Let's move it up to the next A.
 

00:48:27.239 --> 00:48:28.429
I want to get to C.
 

00:48:28.429 --> 00:48:33.440
Tell you what. Go straight to C.
 

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:35.190
This is pretty cool what he
does here.

00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:40.150
He's in this particular key
&gt;

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.960
and he gives us this sound,
&gt;

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.625
kind of a shocking chord change
right in the middle of the

00:48:46.625 --> 00:48:47.139
piece.
 

00:48:47.139 --> 00:48:50.119
It's kind of what we would call
a flat seventh degree.

00:48:50.119 --> 00:48:53.559
Let's see if we can hear this
tonal shock and then we'll stop.

00:48:53.559 --> 00:49:16.289
&gt;
 

00:49:16.289 --> 00:49:19.159
Then he jumps back to the tonic
&gt;

00:49:19.159 --> 00:49:22.898
and from there on out he's just
running the I,

00:49:22.898 --> 00:49:26.719
VI, IV, V, I instrumentally in
this section.

00:49:26.719 --> 00:49:30.010
Then the B section comes back
and the A section at the end

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.800
&gt;
 

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.664
so that's it.
 

00:49:32.664 --> 00:49:34.460
I think we're out of time.
 

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.175
And I thank you for staying
over a bit and we'll see you on

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:38.880
Thursday.
 

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:46.400
&gt;
 

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:51.000

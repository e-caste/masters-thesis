00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.055
Professor John Rogers:
The best way,

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:09.040
I think, to introduce the
central issues of this wonderful

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.816
poem, "Lycidas,"
is to return to Milton's

00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.220
Comus. So yet once
more -- and I promise this will

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.694
be one of the last times that we
look back at Milton's mask --

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:25.610
but yet once more,
let's look at Comus.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.689
Now you will remember that
the mask Comus was

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.656
everywhere concerned with
questions of the power of --

00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:33.545
well,
the strangely intertwined

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:36.705
questions of the power of
chastity on the one hand and the

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:40.452
power of poetry on the other.
The two brothers in the mask

00:00:40.452 --> 00:00:44.115
engaged in that philosophical
debate about the force,

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:46.440
or the strength,
of virginity.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.921
The Second Brother,
you'll remember,

00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.630
had taken what I take to be the
perfectly reasonable position,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.483
the cautious position,
that the Lady is in danger --

00:00:53.483 --> 00:00:59.375
that she's a sitting duck,
in fact, out there in the

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:04.099
dangerous forest.
According to the Second

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.390
Brother, it's virtually
impossible for a single,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.610
helpless maiden to pass
uninjured in this wild,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.466
surrounding waste.
Now the Elder Brother,

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:15.903
we remember,
hastily dismissed his brother's

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.584
pessimism,
and then he insisted that the

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:22.339
Lady's virginity was fully
capable of protecting her from

00:01:22.339 --> 00:01:26.027
any such physical attack.Now
to the extent that this

00:01:26.027 --> 00:01:30.251
discussion is actually about the
virginity of the Second Brother

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:34.864
and the Elder Brother's sister,
it seems, I think,

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:39.116
to border on the ridiculous;
but the debate,

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:41.340
I think, we have to take
seriously.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.984
It's an important one for
Milton, and it's important

00:01:43.984 --> 00:01:47.200
because it touches on a lot of
more consequential questions.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.348
I'm thinking of the general
problem of the abstraction of

00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:57.629
virtue, an abstract notion of
virtue.

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:02.762
Think of all the questions that
all of us at some point or other

00:02:02.762 --> 00:02:07.372
tend to associate with virtue.
Is virtuous behavior repaid

00:02:07.372 --> 00:02:11.770
with some kind of ultimate good?
Are we rewarded for our virtue

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.012
and for our virtuous deeds?
Are we recompensed in some way

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:21.180
for all of those sacrifices that
we make in the name of virtue?

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.971
These are questions that Milton
will never stop asking and that

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.539
he will never stop attempting to
answer.

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:31.417
The position that Milton --
this is how I like to read it --

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.425
the position that Milton would
like to be able to take on this

00:02:35.425 --> 00:02:39.434
question of virtue's reward is
formulated by the Elder Brother

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:42.385
in Comus.
I'm thinking of the passage

00:02:42.385 --> 00:02:44.949
near the bottom of page 103 in
the Hughes.

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:48.465
This is Comus,
line 588 -- the Elder

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:50.400
Brother.
The brother says: 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.657
Virtue may be assail'd
but never hurt, Surpris'd by

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:58.677
unjust force but not enthrall'd,
 Yea even that which

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:02.562
mischief meant most harm
Shall in the happy trial prove

00:03:02.562 --> 00:03:06.134
most glory.
But evil on itself shall back

00:03:06.134 --> 00:03:11.311
recoil And mix no more with
goodness, when at last

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:15.878
Gather'd like scum,
and settl'd to itself, It

00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:20.394
shall be in eternal restless
change Self-fed and

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:24.669
self-consum'd;
if this fail, The pillar'd

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:29.560
firmament is rott'nness, And
earth's base built on

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.819
stubble.
Virtue invariably protects

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.487
itself.
Virtue is invariably rewarded

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:40.080
with glory and evil -- and this
is the flip side of the coin --

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.051
evil is always punished.
In this amazing image,

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:49.248
it's gathered like scum in some
eternal cesspool where it's

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:53.550
self-fed and self-consumed --
problem solved!

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.149
The Elder Brother continues,
though, "if this fail" -- by

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.598
which he means,
if virtue does not in every

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:04.719
single instance triumph over
evil,

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:07.536
then this is a world whose
heaven, whose pillared

00:04:07.536 --> 00:04:09.590
firmament, is rotten to the
core,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.285
and whose base,
or whose very foundation,

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.469
is nothing but stubble.
If virtue fails to triumph over

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.699
evil, then what?
Then this simply isn't a world

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.316
worth living in.
That's what I take the Elder

00:04:24.316 --> 00:04:28.879
Brother to mean here.These
are unquestionably strong words,

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:34.934
and I think it's impossible for
us to overestimate the weight of

00:04:34.934 --> 00:04:38.053
these words.
The speech is more than just a

00:04:38.053 --> 00:04:40.891
pious bit of optimism like a lot
of the speeches,

00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:43.730
in fact, that the other brother
has given us.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.250
We have to confess that it's
more than that.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.102
This speech is a challenge.
The Elder Brother is

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:54.420
challenging God to see to it
that some kind of justice is

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.294
actually effected on this earth;
and so I'm going to be placing

00:04:59.294 --> 00:05:03.787
a particular amount of pressure
on this passage because this is

00:05:03.787 --> 00:05:07.990
the first expression in Milton
of a very particular kind of

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.161
argument: a religious argument,
and it's one that becomes

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:14.410
central to all of Paradise
Lost.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.790
The speech of the Elder
Brothers is a theodicy.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.730
Theodicy is the term
coined by the eighteenth-century

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.812
philosopher Leibniz,
and he applied this term

00:05:25.812 --> 00:05:29.777
theodicy to just that
kind of philosophical sentiment

00:05:29.777 --> 00:05:34.439
that's implied by its etymology.
The theodicy is an account of

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.660
the justice (the dike) of
God (theos).

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.491
And so, to use the words with
which Milton would begin

00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:44.665
Paradise Lost,
a theodicy is an attempt "to

00:05:44.665 --> 00:05:48.207
justify the ways of God to
men."Now for a lot of

00:05:48.207 --> 00:05:52.445
orthodox Christians in Milton's
time -- and I think we can say

00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:56.752
the same for a lot of orthodox
Christians in our own time -- to

00:05:56.752 --> 00:06:00.156
embark upon anything like a
theodicy at all can be

00:06:00.156 --> 00:06:04.740
considered heretical,
or at the very least heterodox.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.425
A theodicy can be seen as
heretical or even blasphemous

00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:12.519
for the simple reason that it --
think of what it assumes.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:17.769
It assumes that the ways of God
are in fact justifiable.

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:22.155
A theodicy assumes that God's
justice can be witnessed,

00:06:22.155 --> 00:06:25.810
that it can be accounted for
here on earth.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.547
A theodicy assumes that things
on earth actually make sense and

00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:34.750
that God's ways are ultimately
rationally accessible,

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.326
that they are comprehensible by
human beings,

00:06:37.326 --> 00:06:40.019
and that God can in some way --
and this is,

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:43.368
I think, the central
implication of the Elder Brother

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:47.167
here -- that God can in some way
be held accountable for his

00:06:47.167 --> 00:06:49.748
actions.
To justify the ways of God to

00:06:49.748 --> 00:06:53.551
men is essentially to put God on
trial for the actions that he

00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:56.398
performs.
Of course in the central test

00:06:56.398 --> 00:07:00.377
case this is what we all care
about, for the unfortunate

00:07:00.377 --> 00:07:04.501
events that befall virtuous
people.The next major poem

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:08.335
that Milton writes after
Comus is "Lycidas."

00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:13.399
You'll remember that Milton
published Comus in 1637.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:17.440
It's 1637, later that same
year, that Milton writes

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.495
"Lycidas."
In "Lycidas," Milton

00:07:20.495 --> 00:07:23.740
looks back at the Elder
Brother's theodicy,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.529
and it's almost as if he's
attempting to test its validity.

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.092
You can figure Milton asking in
this poem "Lycidas" if it's

00:07:32.092 --> 00:07:34.980
true: is it true what the Elder
Brother said,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.779
that virtue is always rewarded
and evil punished?

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:42.946
Now "Lycidas," and this
is undeniable,

00:07:42.946 --> 00:07:46.184
is ostensibly,
and maybe more than ostensibly,

00:07:46.184 --> 00:07:49.920
an elegy.
It's a poem about a death.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.699
It mourns the loss of a friend
of Milton's from Cambridge.

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:58.493
The young man was named Edward
King, and he drowned in a

00:07:58.493 --> 00:08:02.494
shipwreck in the Irish Sea
shortly before he took up orders

00:08:02.494 --> 00:08:05.529
as a minister for the Church of
England.

00:08:05.529 --> 00:08:08.063
Like so many -- and I mentioned
this before -- like so many of

00:08:08.063 --> 00:08:10.139
the young men studying with
Milton in Cambridge,

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:13.629
King was being prepared to
pursue a career in the

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:16.536
church.Now,
and I don't think this is

00:08:16.536 --> 00:08:20.461
unimportant,
King was also -- it would seem

00:08:20.461 --> 00:08:24.420
he was also a minor poet,
an amateur poet.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.690
Like Milton, he wrote verses.
There is nothing like a shred

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.985
of evidence to suggest that
Edward King had any talent

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:35.765
whatsoever.
Nonetheless,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.349
the fact that he attempted to
be a poet, I think,

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.452
is important here.
Edward King,

00:08:40.452 --> 00:08:44.746
in fact, seems to have been
sufficiently well liked or

00:08:44.746 --> 00:08:49.039
admired that when news of his
death hit Cambridge,

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:52.192
a group of his friends
organized something like an

00:08:52.192 --> 00:08:55.509
anthology of poems in his honor.
This is on the handout.

00:08:55.509 --> 00:09:00.379
The title of the book is
Justa Eduardo King naufrago,

00:09:00.379 --> 00:09:05.250
Obsequies on Edward King,
Lost at Sea or Drowned.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.320
We have no evidence that King
was a particularly close friend

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:14.800
of Milton's, but nonetheless
Milton -- as an ambitious

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.919
literary figure in college,
he was asked to contribute some

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:24.032
verses to the anthology,
and "Lycidas" is the

00:09:24.032 --> 00:09:28.461
product of that request.
We shouldn't be surprised that

00:09:28.461 --> 00:09:31.990
Milton has to be compelled to
write this poem.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.882
He's still in that awkward
phase of unreadiness and under

00:09:35.882 --> 00:09:40.052
preparation.Now readers have
always seemed to have agreed

00:09:40.052 --> 00:09:43.945
that Milton's "Lycidas"
is an enormously admirable

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.992
poem,
but for a few hundred years now

00:09:46.992 --> 00:09:51.041
there has been a controversy
over how admirable Milton's

00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:54.360
"Lycidas" is,
specifically as an elegy.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.710
The poem is obviously
magisterial.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:01.876
It's moving and just about
everyone concedes that at many

00:10:01.876 --> 00:10:06.951
junctures it's extraordinarily
learned -- it's obviously

00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:10.549
learned, but it's also very
moving.

00:10:10.549 --> 00:10:14.110
This is the question now:
is it properly elegiac?

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:18.023
Is "Lycidas" an appropriate
expression of grief over the

00:10:18.023 --> 00:10:21.054
death of Edward King,
and furthermore,

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:25.935
does it console others for
their grief over Edward King's

00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:28.290
death?
Now this is a debate that fits

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.750
into the same category,
as far as I'm concerned,

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.629
as the one between the elder
and the Second Brother.

00:10:33.629 --> 00:10:39.200
This is a debate that will
forever and forever be fruitless

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.735
because it's unanswerable.
Nonetheless,

00:10:42.735 --> 00:10:46.469
I still think there's something
about this controversy

00:10:46.469 --> 00:10:50.697
surrounding this poem -- the
poem as an elegy -- that we need

00:10:50.697 --> 00:10:53.992
to take as instructive;
because if Milton's

00:10:53.992 --> 00:10:57.679
"Lycidas" isn't an
expression of grief over the

00:10:57.679 --> 00:11:02.143
death of Edward King,
then just what -- this is what

00:11:02.143 --> 00:11:07.450
we have to ask -- then just what
is it an expression of?

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.549
So let us begin our
examination of this question

00:11:12.549 --> 00:11:16.950
with the consideration of the
poem's form.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.648
Now the most distinguishing
feature of Milton's elegy is the

00:11:20.648 --> 00:11:25.270
fact that it's a pastoral elegy.
It engages the ancient art of

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:30.338
pastoral poetry initiated and
made famous by the great Greek

00:11:30.338 --> 00:11:34.043
poet Theocritus,
which was later imitated by

00:11:34.043 --> 00:11:38.191
Moscus and then finally by the
Roman poet Virgil in his

00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:42.658
celebrated pastoral eclogues.
You can see on the handout

00:11:42.658 --> 00:11:46.599
those poems by those classical
authors that Milton's

00:11:46.599 --> 00:11:49.690
"Lycidas" is most
indebted to.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.280
The pastoral elegy is clearly
one of the most stylized and

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.250
most self-consciously artificial
of all of the poetic genres.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.394
The poet of a pastoral elegy
usually represents himself as a

00:12:01.394 --> 00:12:05.820
shepherd, a shepherd mourning
the death of a fellow shepherd,

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.401
and he often explains that the
death of his shepherd friend is

00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.690
exerting a magical effect on the
entire natural world.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.139
This is called the pathetic
fallacy.

00:12:14.139 --> 00:12:17.587
The trees, the rocks,
and the streams are all weeping

00:12:17.587 --> 00:12:20.571
for the loss of the
shepherd-speaker's beloved

00:12:20.571 --> 00:12:23.149
companion.
It's at this point in the

00:12:23.149 --> 00:12:25.392
pastoral elegy -- the
conventional,

00:12:25.392 --> 00:12:29.416
stereotypical pastoral elegy --
that the poet-shepherd sings a

00:12:29.416 --> 00:12:32.874
mournful song.
He sings a song in which he

00:12:32.874 --> 00:12:37.528
recalls all of those happy days
that he had spent with his

00:12:37.528 --> 00:12:41.692
shepherd friend in the
countryside.So we have in

00:12:41.692 --> 00:12:47.000
the pastoral elegy a generic
form that's highly predictable.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.524
Not only now,
but, I think,

00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:54.960
on some level it has always
struck some of its readers as

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.218
ludicrous.
We're not being merely

00:12:58.218 --> 00:13:02.275
churlish, I think,
if we want to ask why someone

00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:06.159
would want to write a poem in
such a form.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:10.389
As you can imagine,
it had long been out of fashion

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:14.999
in Milton's own day.
The pastoral genre in fact even

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:17.482
for Theocritus,
its inventor,

00:13:17.482 --> 00:13:22.426
was always highly artificial.
Theocritus knew no more about

00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:25.912
shepherds or sheep or
shepherdesses or nymphs and

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:29.761
satyrs than you or I know and
later urban poets -- and

00:13:29.761 --> 00:13:34.046
Theocritus was an urban poet
--later urban poets like Virgil

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:39.130
or Milton (Milton our Londoner)
knew even less than Theocritus,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.084
we have to assume.
It's almost as if the entire

00:13:42.084 --> 00:13:46.702
point of a pastoral is that it
is set in a world that neither

00:13:46.702 --> 00:13:51.165
the urbane poet nor the urbane
reader has actually any real

00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:54.936
experience with.Another way
into this problem:

00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:57.553
let's look at the comments that
Dr.

00:13:57.553 --> 00:14:01.401
Johnson made about Milton's
"Lycidas" in the

00:14:01.401 --> 00:14:05.879
eighteenth century.
This is reading from the packet

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:09.309
assigned for today,
and I'm going to ask you to do

00:14:09.309 --> 00:14:13.299
what you can to get through the
biography of Milton in the

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:16.030
packet,
as well as the notes on

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.990
Milton's poetry that we have
from Dr.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.517
Samuel Johnson.
Make sure you all have done

00:14:22.517 --> 00:14:24.507
that by the midterm.
Okay.

00:14:24.507 --> 00:14:27.609
Famously, Dr.
Johnson couldn't bear this

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:32.142
poem, "Lycidas" -- Dr.
Johnson, the greatest of all

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:35.960
literary critics of the
eighteenth century.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.069
Because Milton's poem is
probably considered to be the

00:14:39.069 --> 00:14:42.529
most important elegy written in
any language by any poet,

00:14:42.529 --> 00:14:47.169
Johnson's assessment of it has
become famous for being one of

00:14:47.169 --> 00:14:51.191
the most wrong-headed
evaluations ever made of a work

00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:55.444
of literature by a great
literary critic -- but inspired

00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:58.615
wrong-headedness,
which is what I take Dr.

00:14:58.615 --> 00:15:02.250
Johnson to be guilty of,
is invaluable.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.813
And so I want to quote Dr.
Johnson here,

00:15:04.813 --> 00:15:08.011
and this is on the handout.
["Lycidas"]

00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:12.340
is not to be considered as the
effusion of real passion;

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:16.734
for passion runs not after
remote allusions and obscure

00:15:16.734 --> 00:15:20.071
opinions.
Passion plucks no berries from

00:15:20.071 --> 00:15:23.816
the myrtle and ivy,
nor calls upon Arethuse and

00:15:23.816 --> 00:15:28.374
Mincius, nor tells of "rough
satyrs and fauns with cloven

00:15:28.374 --> 00:15:31.033
heel."
"Where there is leisure for

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.580
fiction, there is little
grief."

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.721
[The]
form [of the pastoral elegy,

00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:41.070
or the form of "Lycidas"]
is that of a pastoral,

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.500
easy, vulgar and therefore
disgusting…

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.299
Now I have to say,
although the last word is

00:15:47.299 --> 00:15:49.559
obviously incredibly powerful
and sort of wonderful,

00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:52.066
it doesn't have quite the punch
that it does -- it didn't have

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:54.203
quite the punch in the
eighteenth century that it has

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:57.191
for us now.
Disgusting really means

00:15:57.191 --> 00:16:00.670
literally for Johnson merely
"distasteful."

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.220
These are still strong words.
There has to be something more

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.943
here than merely Johnson's
massive blunder as a literary

00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:11.029
critic.
Johnson tells us that "Lycidas"

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:15.460
is not to be considered as the
effusion of real passion,

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:19.206
for passion runs not after
remote allusions and obscure

00:16:19.206 --> 00:16:22.392
opinions.
It's difficult to imagine that

00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:26.590
as an expression of genuine
grief over the death of a

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:30.950
genuinely close friend would
take the form of a poem so

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:33.833
learned,
so filled with remote literary

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:37.685
allusions and obscure opinions.
Johnson obviously has a point

00:16:37.685 --> 00:16:41.672
here.But we have to remember
that King himself was a poet,

00:16:41.672 --> 00:16:43.960
or thought of himself as a
poet.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:47.480
He was a poet who died before
he could take up his career,

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.247
and it's not unlikely that --
he wasn't married -- that he was

00:16:51.247 --> 00:16:54.519
also a poet who died while he
was still a virgin.

00:16:54.519 --> 00:16:58.860
King's death provides Milton
with an occasion on which Milton

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.767
is able to write the most
personal poem that he has yet

00:17:02.767 --> 00:17:06.240
written and perhaps that he will
ever write.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.522
He gets to ask all of those
questions that are most pressing

00:17:10.522 --> 00:17:13.606
to him, John Milton.
What if the virginal Milton

00:17:13.606 --> 00:17:16.579
were to die before he was able
to take up his career?

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:21.926
What if he died before he was
able to fulfill his promise as a

00:17:21.926 --> 00:17:27.009
poet, before he could publish or
make public his talent?

00:17:27.009 --> 00:17:30.654
The very structure,
in fact, of Milton's poem here

00:17:30.654 --> 00:17:33.481
is what Dr.
Johnson would be obliged to

00:17:33.481 --> 00:17:38.026
call a remote allusion.
The poem is based most closely

00:17:38.026 --> 00:17:41.995
on Virgil's Tenth Eclogue.
This is the poem in which the

00:17:41.995 --> 00:17:45.250
speaker grieves over a death by
imagining a procession of

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.303
mourners at the funeral.
This really provides the

00:17:48.303 --> 00:17:51.764
central rhetorical base for
Milton's "Lycidas."

00:17:51.764 --> 00:17:54.854
The speaker of the poem
mourns the death of the

00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:58.130
shepherd-poet Lycidas and
describes this parade,

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:02.347
this procession of mourners who
make their tribute to the

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:06.791
deceased.So look at line --
I'll run through some of the

00:18:06.791 --> 00:18:09.760
essential sections here.
Lines seventy-six to

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.109
eighty-four.
We have the god of poetry,

00:18:12.109 --> 00:18:15.343
Phoebus Apollo himself,
who makes an appearance,

00:18:15.343 --> 00:18:19.472
and he chides Milton for being
so concerned with earthly fame

00:18:19.472 --> 00:18:22.673
-- more on that later.
Line eighty-eight,

00:18:22.673 --> 00:18:26.329
the next section:
Triton, the herald of the sea.

00:18:26.329 --> 00:18:28.980
He tries to make sense of
Lycidas' death.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.355
He asks the gods what has
happened to Lycidas and who

00:18:33.355 --> 00:18:38.319
exactly was responsible for the
sinking of Lycidas' ship.

00:18:38.319 --> 00:18:41.759
In the next line four lines,
we have Camus;

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:44.960
the god of the river Cam
appears.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.608
He represents Cambridge
University, the alma

00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:51.349
mater, where Edward King and
John Milton had been students.

00:18:51.349 --> 00:18:57.557
And finally at lines 108
through 131, we have Saint

00:18:57.557 --> 00:19:04.099
Peter, he of the pearly gates.
Peter bursts onto the scene.

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:07.487
Without question he's the most
terrifying of all of the

00:19:07.487 --> 00:19:11.565
mourners, and he gives an angry,
powerful, vitriolic speech

00:19:11.565 --> 00:19:15.980
about the terrible state of
England -- the terrible state of

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.351
the Church of England and,
as a consequence,

00:19:19.351 --> 00:19:22.884
of the terrible state of
England in 1637.So the

00:19:22.884 --> 00:19:26.700
structure of this poem is
unquestionably Virgilian,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.739
but the sentiments that are
voiced in this poem are

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:34.400
unquestionably Miltonic,
and we will recognize them.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:41.930
Who but Milton could speak the
poem's famous opening lines?

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:43.880
Turn to the beginning of
"Lycidas."

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.327
Yet once more,
O ye Laurels,

00:19:46.327 --> 00:19:50.630
and once more Ye Myrtles
brown, with Ivy never sere,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.572
 I come to pluck your
Berries harsh and crude, And

00:19:54.572 --> 00:19:58.391
with forc'd fingers rude,
 Shatter your leaves before

00:19:58.391 --> 00:20:01.124
the mellowing year.
Bitter constraint,

00:20:01.124 --> 00:20:05.382
and sad occasion dear,
Compels me to disturb your

00:20:05.382 --> 00:20:09.313
season due: For Lycidas is
dead, dead ere his

00:20:09.313 --> 00:20:12.632
prime...
Milton is lamenting,

00:20:12.632 --> 00:20:18.009
once again, that Milton has
been compelled to begin writing.

00:20:18.009 --> 00:20:21.069
Edward King had died,
and the editor of the Edward

00:20:21.069 --> 00:20:24.690
King Memorial Anthology has
pressed Milton into service.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.441
What could the young poet do?
Bitter constraint and sad

00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:31.812
occasion are forcing him to
write, even though,

00:20:31.812 --> 00:20:36.028
of course, he's not yet ready.
The laurels and the myrtles

00:20:36.028 --> 00:20:39.559
that he addresses here are,
of course, the traditional

00:20:39.559 --> 00:20:42.890
plants classically associated
with great poets;

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:49.113
but for Milton in this passage,
importantly these plants simply

00:20:49.113 --> 00:20:52.913
aren't ripe yet.
Their berries are still harsh

00:20:52.913 --> 00:20:55.910
and crude.
They haven't yet had time to

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.472
develop.
Milton is telling us that he is

00:20:58.472 --> 00:21:01.088
himself in the process,
still in the process,

00:21:01.088 --> 00:21:04.261
of maturing.
He's not yet up to the task of

00:21:04.261 --> 00:21:07.234
a great poem yet.
The only fingers with which

00:21:07.234 --> 00:21:10.562
he'll be able to hold his pen
and write this poem are his

00:21:10.562 --> 00:21:12.938
forced fingers rude.Now
you're right:

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.078
you're right if you have the
[laughs]

00:21:15.078 --> 00:21:19.000
feeling that you've heard a lot
of these same ideas before.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.414
Milton's nearly twenty-nine
years old when he writes

00:21:22.414 --> 00:21:26.497
"Lycidas." He's making
exactly the same disclaimer that

00:21:26.497 --> 00:21:30.570
he had made in Sonnet Seven.
You remember Sonnet Seven,

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.581
"How Soon Hath Time," the
sonnet that he had written on

00:21:34.581 --> 00:21:38.220
the sad occasion of his
twenty-third birthday.

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.007
Milton had claimed there that
he seemed to have all the

00:21:41.007 --> 00:21:43.019
outward appearances of an adult
male,

00:21:43.019 --> 00:21:47.463
of a man, but "[an]
inward ripeness doth much less

00:21:47.463 --> 00:21:49.838
appear."
His poetic talent,

00:21:49.838 --> 00:21:53.429
his poetic promise,
his poetic ripeness -- it

00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:57.753
hasn't yet burgeoned or made
itself manifest.Well,

00:21:57.753 --> 00:22:01.955
this is six years later.
Six years later when Milton

00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:06.240
writes "Lycidas," he's employing
the same fiction of unreadiness

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.660
and filled with all of the same
anxiety of under-preparedness.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.846
As in Sonnet Seven,
Milton writes the first verse

00:22:14.846 --> 00:22:19.041
paragraph of this great poem,
"Lycidas" -- the first

00:22:19.041 --> 00:22:21.869
fourteen lines -- in essentially
the form of a sonnet.

00:22:21.869 --> 00:22:25.993
The lines have distinctly a
sonnet rhyme-scheme,

00:22:25.993 --> 00:22:29.556
but look closely.
It's not a perfect sonnet in

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:32.400
quite the same way that Sonnet
Seven was.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.788
Look at line number four,
which is so clearly -- simply

00:22:35.788 --> 00:22:38.863
by looking at this,
you can tell it's deficient in

00:22:38.863 --> 00:22:43.240
the number of syllables.
There are only six syllables

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.890
here rather than the
conventional ten.

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.853
It's this line,
"And with forc'd fingers rude"

00:22:49.853 --> 00:22:53.079
-- this is called a broken line
or a half-line,

00:22:53.079 --> 00:22:55.711
and this broken line has been
read, I think,

00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:59.506
rightly as Milton's indication
to his reader that he's not even

00:22:59.506 --> 00:23:02.750
up to the task of writing a
sonnet at this point.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:08.242
Anything he writes is going to
be forced, compelled -- and with

00:23:08.242 --> 00:23:13.380
his forced fingers rude he
violates the formal prosodic,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.460
the metrical,
scheme of his elegy at its very

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.495
opening.
Just like Edward King who died

00:23:19.495 --> 00:23:23.075
before his prime,
Milton has to write this poem

00:23:23.075 --> 00:23:27.434
before his own poetic prime and
so it is with this deeply

00:23:27.434 --> 00:23:31.014
apologetic,
intensely hesitant beginning

00:23:31.014 --> 00:23:36.349
that John Milton opens what many
consider to be the greatest poem

00:23:36.349 --> 00:23:41.185
in the English language.The
fact that the death here in

00:23:41.185 --> 00:23:45.019
"Lycidas" is the death of
a young,

00:23:45.019 --> 00:23:47.828
virginal poet at the very
outset of his career,

00:23:47.828 --> 00:23:50.820
as you can imagine,
resonates in a lot of powerful

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.262
ways.
The very idea that a figure so

00:23:53.262 --> 00:23:56.984
virtuous could have been dealt
such a tragic and early death

00:23:56.984 --> 00:23:59.727
strikes Milton,
or Milton's speaker here,

00:23:59.727 --> 00:24:03.218
as the rankest injustice.
It's this sense of injustice

00:24:03.218 --> 00:24:07.116
that keeps pushing this elegy in
the direction of a theodicy:

00:24:07.116 --> 00:24:09.779
an attempt to justify the ways
of God.

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:14.155
Milton has to justify or at
least understand this seemingly

00:24:14.155 --> 00:24:17.400
incomprehensible and
unjustifiable event.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.983
It's this drive to theodicy
that accounts for the poem's

00:24:21.983 --> 00:24:26.880
most painful moments.
Look at line fifty.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:31.191
This is where Milton asks the
ocean nymphs where they were

00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:35.805
when Edward King's boat was lost
while crossing the Irish Sea:

00:24:35.805 --> 00:24:39.805
why didn't you do anything?
"Where were ye Nymphs,

00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:43.945
when the remorseless deep /
clos'd o'er the head of your

00:24:43.945 --> 00:24:47.904
lov'd Lycidas?"
If you loved Lycidas so much,

00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:52.578
how could you let him die?
No sooner has the speaker asked

00:24:52.578 --> 00:24:56.640
this question -- and you see
this rhythm, this dynamic,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.759
appear continually throughout
"Lycidas" -- he asks the

00:24:59.759 --> 00:25:02.880
question, and then immediately
he acknowledges the inadequacy

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.164
of the question.
Look at line fifty-five:

00:25:06.164 --> 00:25:10.493
"Ay me, I fondly dream!
/ Had ye been there -- for what

00:25:10.493 --> 00:25:13.542
could that have done?"
The nymphs, of course,

00:25:13.542 --> 00:25:15.864
are powerless,
and worse than that,

00:25:15.864 --> 00:25:18.390
[laughs]
the nymphs, as we know and of

00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:22.010
course as John Milton knew,
are merely fictions.

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.810
This is all made up.
It's folly to think that we

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.315
have about us protective spirits
who might actually keep us from

00:25:29.315 --> 00:25:33.113
harm.Milton continues:
What could the Muse

00:25:33.113 --> 00:25:36.222
herself that Orpheus bore,
The Muse herself,

00:25:36.222 --> 00:25:40.390
for her enchanting son Whom
Universal nature did lament,

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:44.666
 When by the rout that made
the hideous roar, His gory

00:25:44.666 --> 00:25:50.009
visage down the stream was sent,
 Down the swift Hebrus to

00:25:50.009 --> 00:25:54.282
the Lesbian shore?
Why after all should we expect

00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:56.579
the nymphs to have helped poor
Lycidas?

00:25:56.579 --> 00:26:00.328
Not even the muse Calliope,
the muse of epic poetry,

00:26:00.328 --> 00:26:04.369
was in a position to avert a
human tragedy like this.

00:26:04.369 --> 00:26:08.352
Calliope hadn't even been able
to save her son,

00:26:08.352 --> 00:26:12.508
the poet Orpheus,
when the terrifying Bacchae had

00:26:12.508 --> 00:26:17.876
torn his body limb from limb --
when the terrifying Bacchae had

00:26:17.876 --> 00:26:23.158
sent his head rolling down the
Hebrus River all the way to the

00:26:23.158 --> 00:26:27.150
Isle of Lesbos.
If you've read "L'Allegro" and

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.018
"Il Penseroso," you know
that the image of the great

00:26:31.018 --> 00:26:35.220
mythological poet Orpheus is
always a loaded one for Milton.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.179
This is a myth that has and
will continue to haunt Milton

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:42.856
all the way up through
Paradise Lost.Let's

00:26:42.856 --> 00:26:47.028
have a little review of the
career of the great poet Orpheus

00:26:47.028 --> 00:26:50.140
as we get it certainly in
"L'Allegro" and "Il

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:54.312
Penseroso." Orpheus was
the poet who had attempted to

00:26:54.312 --> 00:26:57.610
bring his wife,
Eurydice, back from the

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:01.670
underworld, and he did that by
charming Pluto with his song.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.842
The attempt failed and,
saddened by Eurydice's death,

00:27:04.842 --> 00:27:08.319
Orpheus spent the rest of his
life avoiding the company of

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:12.437
women.
He kept himself solitary and

00:27:12.437 --> 00:27:15.269
chaste.
He devoted himself to poetry.

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:18.962
He sang songs of such beauty
that the entire natural world

00:27:18.962 --> 00:27:21.230
would move and dance in
response.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.464
This is the story of Orpheus
that we have received up to this

00:27:24.464 --> 00:27:27.348
point in Milton's poetry.
This is the story of the

00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:30.385
empowerment of the poet,
his empowerment through his

00:27:30.385 --> 00:27:34.850
experience of a terrible loss.
Clearly this is a myth that

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:40.037
Milton is identifying with very
strongly here.But the

00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:45.410
subject of "Lycidas" isn't the
empowerment of the poet.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.019
It's about the untimely death
of a poet.

00:27:48.019 --> 00:27:51.728
And so when the figure of
Orpheus appears in this poem,

00:27:51.728 --> 00:27:55.505
it's the second half of the
Orpheus story that Milton is

00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:58.434
forced to tell.
Orpheus devotes himself to his

00:27:58.434 --> 00:28:00.925
beautiful poetry,
and he keeps himself sexually

00:28:00.925 --> 00:28:03.437
abstinent.
He rejects all of the advances

00:28:03.437 --> 00:28:06.690
of the women who are attracted
to him but Bacchantes,

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:10.833
the female followers of the god
Bacchus, are enraged by what

00:28:10.833 --> 00:28:15.098
they take to be his coyness.
They drown out Orpheus' music

00:28:15.098 --> 00:28:19.490
with the hideous roar of their
howlings and their screamings

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.170
and they tear him limb from
limb.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:27.475
The chaste poet was unable to
pass uninjured in that wild

00:28:27.475 --> 00:28:31.570
surrounding waste.
This violence was so terrible

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.832
that not even his mother,
the muse Calliope,

00:28:34.832 --> 00:28:39.460
could save him.Orpheus had
provided Milton with a paradigm

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.370
of the poet,
the poet whose discipline and

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:45.500
whose abstinence nourished and
strengthened his poetry.

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.734
Orpheus in a lot of ways seemed
like the perfect model of a poet

00:28:49.734 --> 00:28:53.700
because he had the power to do
something with his poetry.

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.490
His verse actually had a
physical impact on the world.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.823
The rocks, the woods,
and the trees danced in

00:29:00.823 --> 00:29:05.563
response to Orpheus' music.
In Comus, the

00:29:05.563 --> 00:29:09.888
Lady had identified with Orpheus
as she described to Comus what

00:29:09.888 --> 00:29:13.933
her speech about virginity would
do if she were actually to

00:29:13.933 --> 00:29:17.293
deliver it.
She would bring all of Comus'

00:29:17.293 --> 00:29:20.309
magic structures down around his
head.

00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:23.984
It's just this Orphic power
that Milton, like the Lady,

00:29:23.984 --> 00:29:26.569
was always anticipating for
himself.

00:29:26.569 --> 00:29:32.381
He's been waiting and waiting
for his season due so that he

00:29:32.381 --> 00:29:38.794
can ripen into a powerful Orphic
poet.How then can we justify

00:29:38.794 --> 00:29:43.110
the ways of God to men?
How can we justify the fact

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.974
that the abstinent Orpheus,
the virtuous Orpheus,

00:29:45.974 --> 00:29:49.554
was so brutally assaulted and
without any aid from the higher

00:29:49.554 --> 00:29:52.135
powers?
It would seem that the Elder

00:29:52.135 --> 00:29:55.732
Brother and his sister were way
too optimistic in their

00:29:55.732 --> 00:29:59.595
assessment of the protected
status of the virtuous poet and

00:29:59.595 --> 00:30:02.260
the protected status of the
virgin,

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.930
the favored role of the poet.
Virginity does nothing.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:11.029
Virtue does nothing.
Poetry does nothing.

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:15.073
All of the self-discipline and
all of the self-denial in the

00:30:15.073 --> 00:30:18.500
world can do nothing -- this
seems to be one of the

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.749
implications of this poem -- can
do nothing to protect the poet

00:30:22.749 --> 00:30:26.792
from an untimely death.It's
at this moment that the poem

00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:31.157
reaches a remarkable climax,
and I have to say that this is

00:30:31.157 --> 00:30:34.509
actually only one of the poem's
remarkable climaxes.

00:30:34.509 --> 00:30:38.647
This poem has amazing ebbs and
flows throughout its entirety,

00:30:38.647 --> 00:30:42.785
but without question this is
one of the most intense personal

00:30:42.785 --> 00:30:46.670
moments in the elegy.
Look at line sixty-four.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:51.193
Here we have Milton asking
himself all of those questions,

00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:54.049
all of those vocational
questions,

00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:59.313
that this fact -- the fact of
Edward King's death -- seems to

00:30:59.313 --> 00:31:04.119
open up for him:
Alas!

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:08.417
What boots it with uncessant
care To tend the homely

00:31:08.417 --> 00:31:12.715
slighted Shepherd's trade,
And strictly meditate the

00:31:12.715 --> 00:31:15.936
thankless Muse?
Were it not better done as

00:31:15.936 --> 00:31:19.877
others use, To sport with
Amaryllis in the shade, Or

00:31:19.877 --> 00:31:22.750
with the tangles of Neaera's
hair?

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.214
I think these lines at this
point -- I'm going to read them

00:31:27.214 --> 00:31:29.824
again.
They're too important simply to

00:31:29.824 --> 00:31:31.549
have been read once:
Alas!

00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:35.498
What boots it with uncessant
care To tend the homely

00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:39.446
slighted Shepherd's trade,
And strictly meditate the

00:31:39.446 --> 00:31:42.481
thankless Muse?
Were it not better done as

00:31:42.481 --> 00:31:46.275
others use, To sport with
Amaryllis in the shade, Or

00:31:46.275 --> 00:31:49.039
with the tangles of Neaera's
hair?

00:31:49.039 --> 00:31:52.941
At this point in our reading of
Milton, I think these lines have

00:31:52.941 --> 00:31:55.930
an amazing impact.
We've spent a couple of weeks

00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:58.949
now reading Milton's
declarations of the importance

00:31:58.949 --> 00:32:03.644
of the shepherd's trade.
This is the vocation of poetry

00:32:03.644 --> 00:32:08.064
in this pastoral lexicon.
You remember he's written his

00:32:08.064 --> 00:32:10.681
father in "Ad Patrem"
that the trade,

00:32:10.681 --> 00:32:14.150
the vocation of poetry -- it
may be homely and slighted in

00:32:14.150 --> 00:32:17.931
his father's eyes,
but it was of course worth all

00:32:17.931 --> 00:32:21.661
of Milton's time,
all of Milton's uncessant care

00:32:21.661 --> 00:32:25.424
and investment.
And now Milton's in the

00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:28.570
position of asking,
"What for?

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.653
What's this all about?
Look what happened to Edward

00:32:31.653 --> 00:32:33.600
King.
What's the point of all of this

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.418
study, all of this work,
all of this self-denial if I

00:32:36.418 --> 00:32:39.886
could just wind up" -- this is a
good question -- if I could just

00:32:39.886 --> 00:32:44.227
wind up dead tomorrow?
And now that I'm thinking of

00:32:44.227 --> 00:32:48.917
it, why deny myself sexually?
Why deny myself physical

00:32:48.917 --> 00:32:52.934
gratification if I could just
instead sport with Amaryllis in

00:32:52.934 --> 00:32:56.349
the shade or with the tangles of
Neaera's hair?"

00:32:56.349 --> 00:32:59.880
And Milton's asking in these
lines not simply about actual

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.349
erotic entanglements -- although
I think that's there,

00:33:03.349 --> 00:33:07.500
a relation with women -- but
it's a question about erotic

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.807
poetry as well.
Why can't he write love poetry,

00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:13.449
secular poetry,
instead of this much more

00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:16.685
disciplined,
much more difficult mode of

00:33:16.685 --> 00:33:21.925
sacred and prophetic poetry that
he seems already to have wedded

00:33:21.925 --> 00:33:25.413
himself to?
What's the point of making life

00:33:25.413 --> 00:33:30.059
so hard for himself?Look
now, and this is on the handout,

00:33:30.059 --> 00:33:33.245
at the letter that Milton had
written to his friend,

00:33:33.245 --> 00:33:35.935
Charles Diodati.
This letter was written at

00:33:35.935 --> 00:33:39.788
nearly the same time that Milton
was writing "Lycidas." He

00:33:39.788 --> 00:33:43.099
wrote -- and this too is in the
packet -- he wrote:

00:33:43.099 --> 00:33:46.586
Listen,
Diodati, but in secret lest thy

00:33:46.586 --> 00:33:51.340
blush, and let me talk to you
grandiloquently for a while.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:56.410
You ask what I am thinking.
So help me, God,

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:02.005
an immortality of fame.
And we would read -- can you

00:34:02.005 --> 00:34:06.557
imagine getting such a letter?
Milton may well blush at this

00:34:06.557 --> 00:34:10.453
extraordinary confession.
He is courting poetic fame more

00:34:10.453 --> 00:34:14.278
shamelessly at this point in his
career than he has before and

00:34:14.278 --> 00:34:18.124
perhaps that he will after.
The death of Edward King is

00:34:18.124 --> 00:34:22.271
really forcing him to question
the point of his pursuit of

00:34:22.271 --> 00:34:26.199
greatness, of poetic fame,
and all of his ambition.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.699
The poem continues at line
seventy:

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.936
Fame is the spur that the
clear spirit doth raise

00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:38.320
(That last infirmity of Noble
mind) To scorn delights,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.469
and live laborious days,
But the fair Guerdon when we

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:46.989
hope to find, And think to
burst out into sudden blaze,

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:52.740
 Comes the blind Fury with
th'abhorred shears, And

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:58.078
slits the thin-spun life.
It's the pursuit of fame,

00:34:58.078 --> 00:35:02.659
the noble pursuit of fame,
that spurs us to scorn delights

00:35:02.659 --> 00:35:07.249
and to live laborious days.
Fame spurs us to pursue the

00:35:07.249 --> 00:35:10.712
abstinent life of the poet.
It's the guerdon,

00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:14.320
the reward, the prize of fame
that we're continually

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.211
anticipating will burst out
someday in a sudden blaze of

00:35:18.211 --> 00:35:21.299
glory.
But as soon as we hope to find

00:35:21.299 --> 00:35:23.531
that guerdon,
the golden ring,

00:35:23.531 --> 00:35:27.920
comes the blind Fury with the
abhorred shears -- ouch!

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:33.182
-- and slits the thin-spun life.
The blind Fury here is the

00:35:33.182 --> 00:35:37.697
mythological figure Atropos;
this is the Fate that cuts the

00:35:37.697 --> 00:35:41.250
slender thread by which our
lives dangle.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:45.192
Milton lends a special horror,
I think, to this image of a

00:35:45.192 --> 00:35:49.343
blind Fury, and I hope you will
agree with those critics -- I

00:35:49.343 --> 00:35:53.078
didn't make this up -- who find
embedded in these lines

00:35:53.078 --> 00:35:57.159
something like a figurative
intimation of castration.

00:35:57.159 --> 00:36:01.618
Like the furious Bacchae,
the furious Atropos emasculates

00:36:01.618 --> 00:36:05.599
the man who dares to aspire to
poetic greatness.

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:10.110
With the abhorred shears she
cruelly punishes the virgin poet

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:14.770
for his failure on the one hand
to use the sexual body that God

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.402
has endowed him with,
but you also have the image

00:36:18.402 --> 00:36:21.592
here of the poet's death.
You have the image of the

00:36:21.592 --> 00:36:25.139
cutting off, the castration,
of the power of generativity.

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:29.515
All poetic potency,
all power to assert oneself in

00:36:29.515 --> 00:36:34.962
the world, can be severed and
that's it.I don't think that

00:36:34.962 --> 00:36:39.873
the critics who see here an
image of castration are just

00:36:39.873 --> 00:36:43.809
imagining it,
because there is such a weird

00:36:43.809 --> 00:36:47.670
and such a persistent interest
in the human body,

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.527
and especially in the poet's
body, throughout this poem --

00:36:51.527 --> 00:36:56.005
Milton's focus on the body,
on the entire realm of the

00:36:56.005 --> 00:36:58.531
corporeal.
I'm hoping that it feels a

00:36:58.531 --> 00:37:00.891
little strange to you and it
seems strange,

00:37:00.891 --> 00:37:03.789
I think,
when you consider what is

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:09.260
obviously here the Christian
context of Milton's "Lycidas."

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.776
Orthodox Christianity teaches
us to put aside our concerns for

00:37:13.776 --> 00:37:16.590
the body when we consider our
death.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.304
The Old Testament prophet had
said, "All flesh is grass," an

00:37:21.304 --> 00:37:26.019
important verse for the new
dispensation of Christianity.

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:29.646
The only thing that matters is
the salvation of the

00:37:29.646 --> 00:37:34.700
incorporeal, the bodiless soul,
but Milton is so unorthodox,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:39.072
or at least heterodox,
in his insistence on the

00:37:39.072 --> 00:37:44.393
importance of the body in this
poem.Look at the verse

00:37:44.393 --> 00:37:48.100
paragraph that begins at line
132.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:52.449
Oh, this passage!
Milton asks the Sicilian muse

00:37:52.449 --> 00:37:57.837
-- this is the muse of pastoral
poetry -- asks the muse to help

00:37:57.837 --> 00:38:01.400
him strew the flowers over the
hearse,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:06.330
to strew with flowers the
casket in which Lycidas' body

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.710
lies.
The body of Lycidas,

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:12.365
even in death,
is of an unusual interest to

00:38:12.365 --> 00:38:15.387
our poet.
The speaker employs -- this is

00:38:15.387 --> 00:38:18.354
an amazingly physical,
and I think it's even a

00:38:18.354 --> 00:38:21.842
sensual,
language as he catalogs the

00:38:21.842 --> 00:38:27.060
flowers that he imagines will
cover Lycidas' body.

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.867
Line 135: 
Ye valleys low where the

00:38:32.867 --> 00:38:37.760
mild whispers use Of shades
and wanton winds and gushing

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:41.289
brooks,
 On whose fresh lap the

00:38:41.289 --> 00:38:46.989
swart Star sparely looks,
Throw hither all your quaint

00:38:46.989 --> 00:38:51.057
enamell'd eyes,
 That on the green turf

00:38:51.057 --> 00:38:54.250
suck the honied
showers…

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.130
Okay: maybe the Elder Brother
in Comus was wrong.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.259
The virgin's body can't -- you
remember that amazing

00:39:01.259 --> 00:39:04.449
counterfactual fantasy -- the
virgin's body can't,

00:39:04.449 --> 00:39:08.540
perhaps we're acknowledging
here, can't be transmuted into

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.188
spirit or soul.
But we can still tend,

00:39:11.188 --> 00:39:13.329
and we can nurse,
the dead body.

00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:17.488
We can lovingly care for it and
ornament it here in our very

00:39:17.488 --> 00:39:21.455
corporeal way on earth.
It's an intensely erotic

00:39:21.455 --> 00:39:25.959
passage, this image of
decorating King's tomb with

00:39:25.959 --> 00:39:29.405
flowers.
And it's at the height of this

00:39:29.405 --> 00:39:34.113
vision of our floral decoration
of Lycidas' hearse that the

00:39:34.113 --> 00:39:37.280
speaker is suddenly caught up
short.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.030
Look at line 154.
We read line 154 and we realize

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:45.603
we have been had.
We have just -- we've been

00:39:45.603 --> 00:39:48.112
sucked in.
We have just participated in

00:39:48.112 --> 00:39:51.110
one of the biggest cheats that
poetry can offer.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:57.667
"Ay me!"
he says as he realizes,

00:39:57.667 --> 00:40:00.880
of course, there will be no
flowers.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.930
There's not going to be a
hearse.

00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:04.770
Why not?
There's no body!

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:08.810
There's no body to decorate.
What have we been thinking?

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:12.369
Lycidas was drowned.
His remains are unrecoverable.

00:40:12.369 --> 00:40:16.788
This is a terrible moment of
realization on the part of the

00:40:16.788 --> 00:40:19.288
speaker.
Whilst thee the shores

00:40:19.288 --> 00:40:22.889
and sounding Seas Wash far
away, where'er thy bones are

00:40:22.889 --> 00:40:25.508
hurl'd,
 Whether beyond the stormy

00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:29.439
Hebrides, Where thou perhaps
under the whelming tide

00:40:29.439 --> 00:40:33.369
Visit'st the bottom of the
monstrous world…

00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:37.150
Milton's confronting here the
awful fact that Lycidas' bones

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.803
-- they've been hurled to the
four corners of the sounding

00:40:40.803 --> 00:40:43.550
seas.
They could be anywhere.

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.109
And as if that weren't terrible
enough a realization,

00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:51.284
he goes on to envision an even
more grotesque end for Lycidas'

00:40:51.284 --> 00:40:54.276
body.
He conjures -- surely this is

00:40:54.276 --> 00:40:58.633
indecorous.
This is wildly inappropriate,

00:40:58.633 --> 00:41:03.903
I think, in such a pious poem.
He conjures the indecorous

00:41:03.903 --> 00:41:07.806
image of the dead Lycidas under
the whelming tide visiting the

00:41:07.806 --> 00:41:11.128
bottom of the monstrous sea.
It's that word "visit" that

00:41:11.128 --> 00:41:13.924
gets me every time.
It's so inappropriate and

00:41:13.924 --> 00:41:17.246
ghoulish, I think,
in this already sufficiently

00:41:17.246 --> 00:41:19.483
ghoulish context.
First of all,

00:41:19.483 --> 00:41:23.024
it's like a parody of the epic
journey to the underworld

00:41:23.024 --> 00:41:26.260
that we have in so many
great classical texts,

00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:30.134
and it forces us to think,
at least for a moment here,

00:41:30.134 --> 00:41:33.423
of Lycidas as some ghastly
underwater visitor:

00:41:33.423 --> 00:41:36.671
a skeletal,
monstrous version of Jacques

00:41:36.671 --> 00:41:40.360
Cousteau peering into the
unknowable monstrous,

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:45.367
mysterious depths of the bottom
of the world.This intensely

00:41:45.367 --> 00:41:50.375
intimate focus on the human body
is out of place in a Christian

00:41:50.375 --> 00:41:54.289
elegy and this,
of course, Milton knows.

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:58.158
It's because the investment in
the bodily world is so great

00:41:58.158 --> 00:42:02.159
here that Milton ultimately
turns to the Christian vision,

00:42:02.159 --> 00:42:06.590
the more familiar Christian
vision, of a bodiless afterlife.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.084
This is how this logic goes --
we are all familiar with this:

00:42:10.084 --> 00:42:13.638
our body remains to molder in
the earth or welter in the ocean

00:42:13.638 --> 00:42:16.637
(where'ere),
but our incorporeal spirit

00:42:16.637 --> 00:42:20.296
rises to heaven where it can
enjoy an ethereal,

00:42:20.296 --> 00:42:23.730
a bodiless,
world of eternity.

00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:27.485
And so Milton concludes
"Lycidas" with this standard

00:42:27.485 --> 00:42:32.394
vision of Christian consolation.
On some level this is textbook

00:42:32.394 --> 00:42:35.360
Protestant or Catholic
Christianity.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.264
Weep no more,
woeful Shepherds weep no

00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:41.440
more For Lycidas your sorrow
is not dead,

00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.881
 Sunk though he be beneath
the wat'ry floor, So sinks

00:42:45.881 --> 00:42:51.138
the day-star in the Ocean bed,
 And yet anon repairs his

00:42:51.138 --> 00:42:55.554
drooping head.
This image of the afterlife is

00:42:55.554 --> 00:42:59.039
founded on the orthodox figure
for eternity.

00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:02.625
The body stays to the earth
while the soul,

00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:05.869
like the day-star,
rises to the sky.

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:09.639
But when you look a little more
closely at this conclusion,

00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:13.019
I think you realize that
Milton's heaven is almost as

00:43:13.019 --> 00:43:16.789
invested in the human body as
Milton's earth had been.

00:43:16.789 --> 00:43:19.849
The heaven imagined here is
able actually to supply us,

00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:23.250
in fact, with a better body
than the one we had down here.

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:25.030
When the speaker writes that
the day-star "…

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:30.446
yet anon repairs his drooping
head," we are reminded of

00:43:30.446 --> 00:43:33.353
Orpheus.
We have an image here of the

00:43:33.353 --> 00:43:36.346
reconstituted,
repaired body of Orpheus whose

00:43:36.346 --> 00:43:39.135
gory,
severed head had been sent down

00:43:39.135 --> 00:43:41.960
the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian
shore.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.413
It's as if Milton can't let go
of this most un-Christian

00:43:45.413 --> 00:43:49.526
attachment to the human body.
I think it's fair to say that

00:43:49.526 --> 00:43:53.786
Milton can't really imagine or
fully invest himself in the

00:43:53.786 --> 00:43:57.821
Christian heaven until he can
fully corporealize it and

00:43:57.821 --> 00:44:00.217
imagine it bodily.
This is exactly,

00:44:00.217 --> 00:44:02.250
of course, what he will do in
Paradise Lost.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:06.860
Everyone in Milton's heaven
has a body, even God Himself.

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.059
God Himself in Paradise Lost
is nothing but body.

00:44:10.059 --> 00:44:13.377
His body is the universe
itself.Listen to the

00:44:13.377 --> 00:44:17.524
physicality of the rest of the
description of Milton's heaven

00:44:17.524 --> 00:44:20.980
in "Lycidas." This
is line 172:

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.340
So Lycidas,
sunk low, but mounted high,

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:28.119
Through the dear might of him
that walk'd the waves,

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:32.323
 Where other groves,
and other streams along,

00:44:32.323 --> 00:44:35.800
With Nectar pure his oozy locks
he laves,

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.693
 And hears the unexpressive
nuptial Song, In the blest

00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:45.108
Kingdoms meek of joy and love.
There entertain him all the

00:44:45.108 --> 00:44:49.079
Saints above, In solemn
troops, and sweet Societies

00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:52.541
That sing,
and singing in their glory

00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:58.179
move And wipe the tears
forever from his eyes.

00:44:58.179 --> 00:45:03.388
Clearly, the other groves and
the other streams are different

00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:06.044
in heaven.
They are different from the

00:45:06.044 --> 00:45:09.393
groves and streams we have down
here, but they don't seem

00:45:09.393 --> 00:45:12.383
necessarily to differ,
I submit, in their degree of

00:45:12.383 --> 00:45:15.025
physicality.
Lycidas is going to shampoo his

00:45:15.025 --> 00:45:17.803
hair in heaven much as he
shampooed his hair on earth,

00:45:17.803 --> 00:45:20.320
except in heaven there's always
a difference.

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:26.699
It will be a nectar pure with
which he laves his oozy locks.

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:29.975
And even more important,
Lycidas will continue to sing

00:45:29.975 --> 00:45:32.510
in heaven just as he had sung on
earth,

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.603
except now he can hear the
unexpressive -- that means

00:45:36.603 --> 00:45:41.429
"inexpressible" -- nuptial song.
We remember this song.

00:45:41.429 --> 00:45:45.003
This is the song mentioned in
Revelation 14 that Milton is

00:45:45.003 --> 00:45:48.577
continually alluding to and we
saw him allude to just this

00:45:48.577 --> 00:45:52.355
passage in "Ad Patrem."
John the Divine had written in

00:45:52.355 --> 00:45:56.055
Revelation 14 -- you know this:
And they sung as it were

00:45:56.055 --> 00:45:57.789
a new song before the
throne…

00:45:57.789 --> 00:46:00.808
and no man could learn that
song but the one hundred and

00:46:00.808 --> 00:46:03.661
forty and four thousand,
which were redeemed from the

00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:07.025
earth.
These are they which were

00:46:07.025 --> 00:46:12.079
not defiled with women;
for they are virgins.

00:46:12.079 --> 00:46:15.369
And it's virgins who get to
sing the nuptial song at the

00:46:15.369 --> 00:46:18.179
wedding of the lamb that John
also envisions.

00:46:18.179 --> 00:46:21.768
Milton can't allow himself to
embrace the wonderful fiction,

00:46:21.768 --> 00:46:25.236
that beautiful fiction that had
been espoused by the Elder

00:46:25.236 --> 00:46:28.460
Brother: the fantasy that
virgins don't even die,

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.315
that their bodies are simply
reconstituted somehow [laughs]

00:46:31.315 --> 00:46:34.659
as angelic spirits.
That went too far.

00:46:34.659 --> 00:46:39.110
It was too pagan,
way too unorthodox.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:43.725
But Milton does permit himself
the closest scriptural version

00:46:43.725 --> 00:46:47.178
of that fiction,
and that's John's image in

00:46:47.178 --> 00:46:51.554
Revelation 14 of the special
heavenly rewards for virgin

00:46:51.554 --> 00:46:56.407
poets.Now you also looked at
for today the Latin poem that

00:46:56.407 --> 00:47:00.783
Milton wrote not long after
"Lycidas." That's the

00:47:00.783 --> 00:47:04.768
poem "Damon's Epitaph,"
the "Epitaphium Damonis,"

00:47:04.768 --> 00:47:07.679
written on the very sad
occasion of the death of

00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:10.775
Milton's best friend,
Charles Diodati,

00:47:10.775 --> 00:47:14.010
who died the next year,
1638.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.291
You remember this is the young
fellow that Milton had confessed

00:47:18.291 --> 00:47:21.610
his desire for immortal fame to.
Look at the end of that poem.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:23.550
This is page 139 in the
Hughes.

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.287
This is where Milton
imagines -- you have to turn to

00:47:28.287 --> 00:47:31.401
this.
He imagines Diodati just as he

00:47:31.401 --> 00:47:35.922
had imagined Edward King,
enjoying at last his heavenly

00:47:35.922 --> 00:47:38.800
reward.
This is the English translation

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.868
because the poem is in Latin:
Because you loved the

00:47:42.868 --> 00:47:47.449
blush of modesty and a stainless
youth and because you did not

00:47:47.449 --> 00:47:50.229
taste the delight of the
marriage-bed,

00:47:50.229 --> 00:47:53.210
lo!
the rewards of virginity are

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:56.928
reserved for you.
Your glorious head shall be

00:47:56.928 --> 00:48:01.874
bound with a shining crown and
with shadowing fronds of joyous

00:48:01.874 --> 00:48:06.819
palms in your hands you shall
enact your part eternally in the

00:48:06.819 --> 00:48:11.846
immortal marriage where song and
the sound of the lyre [can you

00:48:11.846 --> 00:48:14.683
even believe what I'm about to
say?]

00:48:14.683 --> 00:48:19.142
are mingled in ecstasy with
blessed dances and where the

00:48:19.142 --> 00:48:24.250
festal orgies rage under the
heavenly thyrsus.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:27.365
Now we recognize the song.
This is the song from

00:48:27.365 --> 00:48:30.800
Revelation of the virgins who
could learn and sing the new

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:33.090
song before the throne of the
Lord,

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:38.309
but Milton has obviously taken
John's image here and exploded

00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:42.050
the implications of its erotic
potential.

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:47.401
It's not just that virgins are
entitled to sing a heavenly song

00:48:47.401 --> 00:48:51.833
as Milton is saying Diodati is.
The heavenly reward in this

00:48:51.833 --> 00:48:55.001
poem involves all of the
sensuality, all of the sensual

00:48:55.001 --> 00:48:58.170
experience, that was denied and
repressed on earth.

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:00.741
This [laughs]
-- "Damon's Epitaph"

00:49:00.741 --> 00:49:04.813
ends with a virtual orgasm
of Christian consolation as

00:49:04.813 --> 00:49:09.242
Milton gives his best friend the
most unbelievable sendoff that

00:49:09.242 --> 00:49:13.118
is possible to give.
The heaven in this poem is so

00:49:13.118 --> 00:49:17.016
far from being the incorporeal
-- the spiritual heaven of

00:49:17.016 --> 00:49:21.610
orthodox Christianity that you
have an image of an actual orgy,

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:26.382
the festal orgy raging under
the thyrsus (that's the phallic

00:49:26.382 --> 00:49:28.050
wand).
Who's holding this wand?

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.939
Presumably none other than the
orgiastic leader,

00:49:30.939 --> 00:49:33.414
God himself.
There's no other way to

00:49:33.414 --> 00:49:36.712
interpret these lines which,
as you can imagine,

00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:39.380
critics simply pretend don't
exist,

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.190
[laughs]
because who can figure out what

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:46.010
to say?In "Lycidas" Milton
doesn't let himself,

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:50.867
thank God, go quite so far as
he does in this amazing ending

00:49:50.867 --> 00:49:55.643
to "Damon's Epitaph." In
fact nowhere else do we see

00:49:55.643 --> 00:50:00.254
Milton literally [laughs]
bursting out at the seams as he

00:50:00.254 --> 00:50:03.851
seems to in this poem.
But the unmistakable

00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:07.143
physicality of the heaven
imagined in the poem about

00:50:07.143 --> 00:50:11.111
Diodati gives us some idea,
I think, of how to read the end

00:50:11.111 --> 00:50:14.257
of "Lycidas." The
corporeality of "Damon's

00:50:14.257 --> 00:50:18.321
Epitaph" illuminates we
can see the unorthodox direction

00:50:18.321 --> 00:50:22.253
in which Milton's "Lycidas" is
tending.So let me conclude

00:50:22.253 --> 00:50:25.210
here.
Milton has wrenched this poem

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.802
away from Christianity,
and he's forced it into a

00:50:28.802 --> 00:50:32.469
direction that we could loosely
call paganism.

00:50:32.469 --> 00:50:35.454
There has been a slippage from
Christian spirituality into

00:50:35.454 --> 00:50:38.229
something like a pagan
naturalism, and it's a world in

00:50:38.229 --> 00:50:40.838
which all things are physical.
All spirits,

00:50:40.838 --> 00:50:43.670
like the genius loci,
are physical,

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:46.639
palpable presences in the
natural world.

00:50:46.639 --> 00:50:50.062
The human body,
the world of flesh and blood

00:50:50.062 --> 00:50:53.962
that we all inhabit,
has in some way at the end of

00:50:53.962 --> 00:50:58.875
this poem reasserted itself.
In this final assertion of the

00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:02.265
body Milton, I think,
is able to recover his

00:51:02.265 --> 00:51:07.469
theodicy, his attempt to justify
the ways of God here on earth.

00:51:07.469 --> 00:51:13.510
Milton's Lycidas' body is still
in some way a physical one.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.483
To the extent that Lycidas'
body has been recovered,

00:51:16.483 --> 00:51:19.558
that it's been redeemed,
Milton is able -- perhaps

00:51:19.558 --> 00:51:22.178
successfully,
Milton is able to justify the

00:51:22.178 --> 00:51:25.878
ways of God to men.
He's able to justify the ways

00:51:25.878 --> 00:51:30.293
of God to men here on the
physical -- on this intimately

00:51:30.293 --> 00:51:35.030
bodily earth.This is the
last thing I will tell you.

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:39.806
As you have no doubt
experienced, this is a dense and

00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:44.030
difficult poem,
so please reread it innumerable

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:48.748
times for Wednesday's class,
and in addition to that do the

00:51:48.748 --> 00:51:51.000
other readings assigned.
Okay.

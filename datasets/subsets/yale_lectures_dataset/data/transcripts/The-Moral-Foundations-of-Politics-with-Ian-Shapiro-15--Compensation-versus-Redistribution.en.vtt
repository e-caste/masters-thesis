00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.700
Prof: So today we're
going to finish up talking about

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.521
Nozick,
and that will give you time to

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:10.550
spend your spring break reading
Rawls,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.560
which is, I know,
what you will all do.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.106
But I want to come back to
something I mentioned briefly

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:24.031
about Nozick,
and just reiterate that he

00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:29.542
thinks that in order to have a
convincing account of justice it

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:33.010
really has to have three
components.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.700
One, what he calls justice in
acquisition.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.900
Two, what he calls justice in
transfer.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.672
And three, what he refers to as
the rectification of past

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:46.780
injustices.
 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.730
You need accounts of all of
those things.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.342
How people got to have what
they have, what should govern

00:00:55.342 --> 00:01:00.454
transactions among them,
and then what should you do

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:03.060
about past injustices.
 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.855
And actually in what we've done
already you've got the main

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:09.799
components of his account in
front of you,

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:17.036
or in your notes from last week
because his theory of justice in

00:01:17.036 --> 00:01:24.043
acquisition is a theory that's
intended to respond to the left

00:01:24.043 --> 00:01:31.049
critique of markets that I'm
going to talk about shortly.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.690
His theory of justice in
transfer is the Pareto system,

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.114
and his theory of the
rectification of past injustices

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:42.790
is a discussion of compensation
that we had last time.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:50.879
So let's think first about this
idea of justice in acquisition.

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:55.920
What he has in mind here is the
left critique of markets.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.464
What he has in mind is the
garbage-in/garbage-out

00:01:59.464 --> 00:02:03.745
phenomenon that the Pareto
principle is a purely procedural

00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:07.659
principle that takes for granted
some status quo.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.614
We worked through this with the
bag lady, and Trump and all of

00:02:12.614 --> 00:02:15.620
that when we did the Pareto
system.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.982
And he has actually an
ingenious answer to this

00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:25.671
critique, and he uses as his way
into it the Wilt Chamberlain

00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:26.810
example.
 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.379
Anybody remember what Nozick
says about Wilt Chamberlain?

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.009
Who was Wilt Chamberlain?
 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.360
Who was Wilt Chamberlain? Yeah?
 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.449
Student:  Basketball
player.

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.360
Prof: He was the best
basketball player in the world

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.419
until Michael Jordan came along,
right?

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.690
Student:  Until Larry
Bird came along.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.610
Prof: Until Larry Bird
came along.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.090
Well, fortunately Nozick didn't
have to adjudicate that one.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.281
And so Nozick said,
"Chamberlain is making a

00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:07.376
contract with the owner of a
team just like professional

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:12.663
players do,
but this contract has a side

00:03:12.663 --> 00:03:14.620
agreement to it.
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.758
Anyone remember what the side
agreement was?

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:21.909
What was the side agreement,
anybody?

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.860
Yeah, over there?
 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.728
Student:  Wasn't it that
Wilt Chamberlain gets a quarter

00:03:29.728 --> 00:03:33.889
of every dollar that the team
gets in ticket sales?

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:35.550
Prof: Exactly right.
 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.809
So on nights when Wilt
Chamberlain is playing in a home

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.429
game,
the ticket price goes up by a

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.742
quarter,
and that quarter literally gets

00:03:46.742 --> 00:03:49.910
dropped into a box and gets
given to Wilt.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:57.609
And apart from that,
his agreement is like any other

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.270
contract.
 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.002
So obviously his agreement with
the team owner is a typical

00:04:03.002 --> 00:04:06.097
player's agreement,
and it's a Pareto superior

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:09.518
transaction,
and there's no question about

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:10.038
that.
 

00:04:10.038 --> 00:04:15.264
But the reason Wilt Chamberlin
gets this quarter is because

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:20.579
he's a charismatic figure and
everybody wants to see him.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.990
What is Nozick doing here?
 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.699
What is the point of this?
 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.170
What's he trying to show us?
 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.630
Anyone want to--it's not
immediately obvious,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.209
but it's quite brilliant.
 

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:52.069
 
 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.670
So here's the point.
 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.730
The point is,
over time Wilt is going to get

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.646
a lot of money from these
quarters because he's the best

00:05:00.646 --> 00:05:05.060
basketball player in the world
and people want to see him.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.319
So he's going to get richer,
and richer, and richer.

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.312
And so maybe,
let's say, after five seasons

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:17.372
of this, he has millions of
dollars in these quarters that

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:18.870
have accumulated.
 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.290
These people have been putting
this quarter in the little box

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.500
that goes to Wilt,
millions.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.290
 
 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.560
Why is this a good example for
Nozick?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.882
Yeah?
 

00:05:36.882 --> 00:05:45.879
Give her--yeah,
over there, yeah.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:48.653
Student:  Well,
perhaps he's showing that even

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:51.800
though this isn't an egalitarian
distribution of wealth,

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.208
it's mutually agreed-upon by
all parties involved so it's

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:56.759
okay.
 

00:05:56.759 --> 00:06:00.983
Prof: So that Pareto
superior transaction every time

00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:03.680
you put that quarter in that
slot,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.283
you make a voluntary choice,
and he makes a voluntary choice

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:10.949
to come out and play and maybe
smile at you or something,

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.430
and both your utility goes up.
 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.812
So it's in that sense just like
any other Pareto superior

00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:22.100
transaction, so why the whole
rigmarole?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.149
What else follows from this
example?

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:35.040
 
 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.790
Think back.
 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.790
Think back to what is his real
target here.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.389
His real target is the left
critique of markets which says,

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:46.480
"If you start out with
unjust initial conditions,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:52.940
if your system of justice in
acquisition isn't met,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.500
then it doesn't matter whether
your transfers are

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.459
voluntary."
 

00:06:56.459 --> 00:07:01.110
So what's he doing here?
 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.310
What the point of this example?
 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.410
Think.
 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.069
 
 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:15.875
Anyone want to have a go at it?
 

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:16.420
Yeah?
 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:22.329
Student:  That what we'd
consider an unjust distribution

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:28.240
of goods or wealth may actually
result from what was originally

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.528
a just distribution.
 

00:07:30.528 --> 00:07:32.341
Prof: Correct.
 

00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:35.966
His bumper sticker is,
"Liberty upsets

00:07:35.966 --> 00:07:37.519
patterns."
 

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.490
Liberty upsets patterns,
this is his point.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.533
He's saying,
"Everybody gets so excited

00:07:43.533 --> 00:07:46.790
about the unjust initial
conditions problem.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.300
I'll tell you what.
 

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.459
I don't know what just initial
conditions are.

00:07:52.459 --> 00:07:54.649
I have no idea, I Robert Nozick.
 

00:07:54.649 --> 00:07:55.899
You pick.
 

00:07:55.899 --> 00:08:00.689
You're an egalitarian,
fine, start with pure equality.

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:05.622
You believe in meritocracy,
fine, start with a meritocratic

00:08:05.622 --> 00:08:06.899
distribution.
 

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:07.625
You pick.
 

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:09.800
I really don't care."
 

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.343
So let's, for the sake of
argument, just say you're an

00:08:13.343 --> 00:08:14.278
egalitarian.
 

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:19.379
So you pick equality,
strict equality.

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:21.699
Everybody starts off with the
same amount.

00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:25.120
Now we're going to allow
voluntary transactions.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.319
You know what's going to happen?
 

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:32.496
You're going to get inequality
because some people are going to

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:36.840
put a quarter in the slot to see
Wilt Chamberlain.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.618
So this stuff about the big
problem with markets,

00:08:40.618 --> 00:08:44.791
the problem of starting points,
the problem of initial

00:08:44.791 --> 00:08:47.940
conditions, it's just a red
herring.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.899
It's a sideshow. It's bunk.
 

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:56.620
Because, in fact,
even if you pick--

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.570
so you're the egalitarian,
just for the sake of argument,

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:06.418
and you pick the starting point
that you are convinced is just,

00:09:06.418 --> 00:09:11.500
and we allow markets to run,
it's going to be undone just by

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.860
the voluntary choices of
individuals.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.668
"So, I,
Robert Nozick,

00:09:17.668 --> 00:09:22.418
say to you, we'll have a little
syllogism.

00:09:22.418 --> 00:09:26.091
If we have just initial
conditions and voluntary

00:09:26.091 --> 00:09:30.700
transfers then the outcome must
be considered just."

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:34.080
That's Nozick's little
syllogism.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.182
You have just initial
conditions and voluntary

00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:40.080
transfers then the outcome must
be just.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.855
It's just a shell game to get
all hung up on the initial

00:09:44.855 --> 00:09:49.109
conditions, however,
because you can pick them and

00:09:49.109 --> 00:09:52.928
we're still going to undo what
you like.

00:09:52.928 --> 00:09:55.080
So you, the egalitarian pick
them.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.879
People go to basketball games,
and what do you know?

00:09:57.879 --> 00:10:02.806
Five years later you have a lot
of inequality,

00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:08.389
and then the only way you can
fix it is coercion.

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:12.830
The only way you can fix it is
taking some of that away from

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:17.269
Chamberlain in the form of taxes
and giving it back to those

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:21.558
people in the form of some sort
of transfer payment,

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:26.759
and that violates his freedom,
uses him to benefit them,

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.470
nothing else.
 

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.100
So liberty upsets patterns.
 

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:36.307
When he talks about a pattern
conception of justice it's one

00:10:36.307 --> 00:10:40.160
where you specify some
distribution whether it's strict

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.498
equality,
whether it's Bentham's

00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:48.110
practical equality,
whether it's some other

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:52.846
distributive system,
whether you specify in advance

00:10:52.846 --> 00:10:57.258
what the outcome is,
he's saying that's a pattern

00:10:57.258 --> 00:11:00.303
conception,
and the problem with it is you

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:03.240
could only maintain it over time
with coercion.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.548
Whereas, if you value freedom
of the individual,

00:11:08.548 --> 00:11:13.005
liberty, remember Nozick is
another one of our Enlightenment

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:17.778
theorists so individual freedom,
individual rights is the

00:11:17.778 --> 00:11:22.083
highest good,
then you have to accept

00:11:22.083 --> 00:11:30.102
whatever voluntary transactions
generate starting from a system

00:11:30.102 --> 00:11:34.629
which you have conceded is just.
 

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:39.681
So in a way he turns the table
on the left critic of markets by

00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:44.000
calling their bluff,
and it's a brilliant argument.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.980
Now you could say,
"Well, this is a

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.200
philosopher's example.
 

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:54.206
After all, we never start from
a system that is universally

00:11:54.206 --> 00:11:57.590
accepted to be just."
 

00:11:57.590 --> 00:12:01.028
But I think he would make two
points in response to that.

00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:04.590
One is, "I'm showing you
that even if you did you would

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:08.211
still have this problem that
over time it would get undone by

00:12:08.211 --> 00:12:11.350
the voluntary transactions of
individuals."

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.408
And secondly,
Nozick wrote this in 1974,

00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:20.614
but I think if he had
lived--well, he did live long

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.759
enough.
 

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:27.772
He died about three years ago,
but if he had been writing this

00:12:27.772 --> 00:12:32.356
book after the early 1990s,
he'd have had some very good

00:12:32.356 --> 00:12:35.902
real world examples of what he
was talking about following the

00:12:35.902 --> 00:12:39.232
collapse of the Soviet Union,
because in a lot of East

00:12:39.232 --> 00:12:42.519
European countries,
such as Czechoslovakia and East

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:46.352
Germany they had these huge
state enterprises that they had

00:12:46.352 --> 00:12:47.940
decided to privatize.
 

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.330
And what did they do?
 

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.230
Well, they basically privatized
them on an egalitarian basis.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.860
That seemed fair.
 

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.840
So there would be these giant
factories that had been

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.163
previously state owned and
everybody would get their little

00:13:02.163 --> 00:13:02.678
chit.
 

00:13:02.678 --> 00:13:07.928
Everybody would get their share
of that factory.

00:13:07.928 --> 00:13:11.966
It was very widespread in
Czechoslovakia and Poland in

00:13:11.966 --> 00:13:16.003
particular, but also in some of
the other ex-communist

00:13:16.003 --> 00:13:17.070
countries.
 

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.750
And what happened?
 

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.668
Well, some people didn't know
what they were,

00:13:22.668 --> 00:13:24.629
probably rolled cigarettes with
them,

00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:27.080
some people put them under the
bed,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.450
some people threw them away,
some people put them in

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:34.186
shoeboxes,
some people started buying them

00:13:34.186 --> 00:13:37.720
up,
started going around and buying

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:43.662
up pieces of this factory that
had been given out as a result

00:13:43.662 --> 00:13:46.039
of the privatization.
 

00:13:46.039 --> 00:13:47.360
And what do you know?
 

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:51.330
Five years later,
ten years later,

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.910
some of the people who had
figured out this might be a good

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.511
thing to do were millionaires,
and other people basically

00:13:59.511 --> 00:14:01.678
didn't have anything.
 

00:14:01.678 --> 00:14:05.244
So it's not a completely
fanciful example,

00:14:05.244 --> 00:14:05.940
right?
 

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.860
And Nozick would say,
"There you go.

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:12.835
What was decided as a fair
distribution of the state assets

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:17.210
at the moment of privatization
was accomplished,

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:19.970
but then markets were allowed
to run,

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.590
and some people took risks,
and some people were creative.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.000
Maybe some people spent all of
their savings buying these

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.678
things up so they internalized
some risk,

00:14:28.678 --> 00:14:30.759
they might have turned out not
to have any value,

00:14:30.759 --> 00:14:33.519
and they got the benefit.
 

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:37.476
And so there you go,
five years later you have

00:14:37.476 --> 00:14:38.620
inequality.
 

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.360
Liberty upsets patterns.
 

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.470
Now are we going to go and take
the millions from the people who

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:49.515
bought up those chits and give
it back to the people who rolled

00:14:49.515 --> 00:14:53.740
them and smoked as cigarettes,
or gave them away,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.732
or lost them,
in order to recreate the

00:14:57.732 --> 00:14:58.919
pattern?
 

00:14:58.919 --> 00:15:05.668
Nozick says no, right?
 

00:15:05.668 --> 00:15:09.057
And this is what he means by
comparing what he calls

00:15:09.057 --> 00:15:12.379
historical principles or
procedural principles,

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:15.355
on the one hand,
with pattern principles or

00:15:15.355 --> 00:15:18.259
end-state principles on the
other hand.

00:15:18.259 --> 00:15:22.658
An end-state principle
specifies some result,

00:15:22.658 --> 00:15:25.639
some end-state,
some condition,

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:31.140
some teleological outcome,
to use the jargon from last

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:37.062
time, whereas a historical or a
procedural principle specifies

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:42.596
no pattern at all and says
whatever is generated by market

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:45.120
transactions is just.
 

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.597
And this long two
hundred-year-old critique of

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:52.695
them based on the status quo,
we now see from the Wilt

00:15:52.695 --> 00:15:55.710
Chamberlain example,
is just smoke.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:16:01.080
 
 

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.669
What about that?
 

00:16:04.669 --> 00:16:05.919
It's a powerful argument.
 

00:16:05.919 --> 00:16:13.909
 
 

00:16:13.909 --> 00:16:17.720
Anyone not like it?
 

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.230
You all like it?
 

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:20.731
What's wrong with it?
 

00:16:20.731 --> 00:16:22.879
What makes you uncomfortable?
 

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:26.460
Can you give her the microphone?
 

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.166
Can you right next--can you
just give her--yeah,

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:31.350
okay, thanks.
 

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:35.076
Student: I'd say that the thing
that's being distributed doesn't

00:16:35.076 --> 00:16:36.908
necessarily have to be money.
 

00:16:36.908 --> 00:16:39.570
If you change the thing being
distributed to,

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.480
I don't know,
education, for example,

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.001
that having equality there
might be something that would

00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:51.030
affect outcomes more than
starting from a concrete

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:52.100
equality.
 

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:54.740
Professor Ian Shapiro:
And why should we care about

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.110
that?
 

00:16:55.110 --> 00:17:00.138
Student: Well,
I guess it's kind of a way of

00:17:00.138 --> 00:17:04.700
changing the process as opposed
to...

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.650
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, so that's fair enough,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.640
so that's one thing somebody
might like about it.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.450
Anything else anyone doesn't
like about it?

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.730
 
 

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:17.336
Student: Well,
Wilt Chamberlain is kind of

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.160
like a self-made...
 

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.623
Professor Ian Shapiro:
You've got to talk a bit

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:19.910
louder.
 

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.390
Student: Wilt Chamberlain is
kind of like a self-made person.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.640
He gets there because of his
basketball talents,

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.616
but it kind of ignores the
problem of people who are born

00:17:27.616 --> 00:17:30.858
into incredible wealth or born
into incredible opportunity.

00:17:30.858 --> 00:17:33.680
Professor Ian Shapiro:
How does it ignore it?

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.905
Student: Well,
I feel like in the situation

00:17:35.905 --> 00:17:38.769
with Wilt Chamberlain he
realizes that he deserves what

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:41.578
he gets and you shouldn't take
it away from him,

00:17:41.578 --> 00:17:45.240
but I don't know if you can
argue that having being born

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.970
into a family that has a lot of
money,

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.724
or being born somewhere where
you can barely put food on the

00:17:51.724 --> 00:17:55.607
table is necessarily someone's
more deserving of having one or

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:56.500
the other.
 

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, so, but that's what he

00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.740
thinks he's answering,
right?

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.588
Because he's saying,
"Okay,

00:18:01.588 --> 00:18:04.976
so you're worried that some
people are born with a lot of

00:18:04.976 --> 00:18:07.940
resources and some are born with
nothing."

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.259
He's saying,
"Fix it however you want.

00:18:12.259 --> 00:18:16.554
So we'll start off by
redistributing and we'll start

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:18.660
off with pure equality.
 

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.532
If you allow markets to run,
it's still going to become

00:18:22.532 --> 00:18:24.900
unequal over time,"
right?

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.180
That's his point.
 

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.720
So what don't you like about
that?

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.992
Student: Well,
I feel like there's a problem

00:18:32.992 --> 00:18:36.094
in the way that--
maybe it's that he believes

00:18:36.094 --> 00:18:39.832
that the markets are truly free
in some way and that there are

00:18:39.832 --> 00:18:43.234
really free transactions,
but I feel like there's not

00:18:43.234 --> 00:18:47.190
necessarily going to be,
ever.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.758
Prof: But isn't that why
he uses the Wilt Chamberlin and

00:18:49.758 --> 00:18:50.670
it's only a quarter?
 

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:54.320
It's only a quarter for crying
out loud, and you didn't have to

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:54.910
give it.
 

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:59.383
It's a trivial amount,
but there it is five years

00:18:59.383 --> 00:19:04.601
later, he's the millionaire and
you're still working in a

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:05.720
factory.
 

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.960
You're not comfortable with it?
 

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.078
Student:  No.
 

00:19:10.078 --> 00:19:11.150
Prof: But you're not
sure why.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.240
Anybody else want to say what?
 

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.818
It's a very clever example.
 

00:19:18.818 --> 00:19:23.272
It's an example of where the
philosopher's example really

00:19:23.272 --> 00:19:25.660
cuts to something important.
 

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.380
Yeah, what's wrong with it?
 

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.704
Student:  Well,
it seems like Wilt Chamberlain

00:19:31.704 --> 00:19:32.509
is an exception.
 

00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:35.096
Prof: Wilt Chamberlain's
an exception,

00:19:35.096 --> 00:19:35.450
why?
 

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.551
Student:  Because the
poor will tend to stay poor and

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.990
the rich will tend to stay rich,
and just because there's

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.965
occasional disruption of the
pattern doesn't mean the pattern

00:19:42.965 --> 00:19:45.049
will be fluctuating all over the
place.

00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:48.664
Prof: Okay,
so he's unusual,

00:19:48.664 --> 00:19:53.977
but what about the--
okay, lets grant your point,

00:19:53.977 --> 00:19:59.328
but what about the example I
just gave of Poland after 1989?

00:19:59.328 --> 00:20:03.842
Everybody starts out equal and
it's just that some people see

00:20:03.842 --> 00:20:08.655
an opportunity here and they get
rich, and other people don't and

00:20:08.655 --> 00:20:10.009
they lose out.
 

00:20:10.009 --> 00:20:12.133
Student:  Well,
Nozick is relegating the

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:13.750
principles to the very
beginning.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:16.769
He's saying you can only apply
your principles at the beginning

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:19.450
and he doesn't let you do that
as a continuous thing.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.907
Prof: Well,
I don't think he'd back down

00:20:21.907 --> 00:20:22.710
that quickly.
 

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.898
He'd say, "Look,
the point of this example is

00:20:24.898 --> 00:20:26.910
I'm letting you define the
beginning."

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:31.482
So after 1989,
the Polish government defines

00:20:31.482 --> 00:20:33.608
the new beginning.
 

00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:36.598
Everybody gets an equal share
of state assets.

00:20:36.598 --> 00:20:40.400
We're creating private property
for the first time.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.864
Everybody's getting an equal
share, but five years later we

00:20:45.864 --> 00:20:47.559
have inequality.
 

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:50.269
Yes ma'am?
 

00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:52.298
Student:  To use,
in particular,

00:20:52.298 --> 00:20:56.048
the example with the shares of
factories in the Soviet Union,

00:20:56.048 --> 00:21:00.134
I think that Nozick is perhaps
making the false assumption that

00:21:00.134 --> 00:21:04.284
everyone is going to have equal
ability to make use of that fair

00:21:04.284 --> 00:21:08.059
distribution at the beginning,
when in fact people who are

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:11.436
poor are not going to be able to
buy up the other shares of the

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:14.061
factories,
and it's going to exacerbate

00:21:14.061 --> 00:21:16.390
inequality that was already
there.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:19.549
Prof: Well,
your point is well-taken,

00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:22.636
but notice I said
Czechoslovakia and Poland

00:21:22.636 --> 00:21:27.047
because in Soviet Union what
tended to happen was bureaucrats

00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:30.942
from the old system used their
special position in the

00:21:30.942 --> 00:21:35.353
bureaucracy and their intimate
knowledge of what was going on

00:21:35.353 --> 00:21:39.910
to enrich themselves and grab a
lot of these assets.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.608
So I didn't want to go with
that example,

00:21:42.608 --> 00:21:46.156
but in the East European
countries there was a lot less

00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:49.306
of that,
and it was more of a sort of

00:21:49.306 --> 00:21:51.298
genuine new beginning.
 

00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:53.654
But you still,
you look at a country like

00:21:53.654 --> 00:21:56.538
Poland and it rapidly became
massively unequal.

00:21:56.538 --> 00:21:58.200
Student: Well,
that makes sense,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.414
but I would assume that those
small inequalities that existed

00:22:01.414 --> 00:22:04.469
in Poland at the beginning of
that redistribution ended up

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:06.720
creating those massive
inequalities.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.134
Professor Ian Shapiro:
That's right.

00:22:08.134 --> 00:22:09.710
It's just like one quarter at a
time.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:10.316
Student: Right.
 

00:22:10.316 --> 00:22:12.215
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Okay, but that's Nozick's

00:22:12.215 --> 00:22:12.578
point.
 

00:22:12.578 --> 00:22:18.785
You don't need some massive
injustice to be done at the

00:22:18.785 --> 00:22:25.220
beginning in order to get huge
inequalities over time.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.736
Let's modify the Wilt
Chamberlain example a little

00:22:29.736 --> 00:22:30.288
bit.
 

00:22:30.288 --> 00:22:35.751
Well, before I do that,
how many people think that the

00:22:35.751 --> 00:22:40.287
outcome in the Wilt Chamberlain
is just fine,

00:22:40.287 --> 00:22:44.615
so he gets rich,
but people want him to get

00:22:44.615 --> 00:22:45.750
rich?
 

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.029
So okay, how many think it's
not fine?

00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:54.804
Okay, a few,
so now let's play with it a

00:22:54.804 --> 00:22:59.160
little bit and see if your
opinion changes.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.150
 
 

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.138
Let's just imagine it's a
single company town,

00:23:07.138 --> 00:23:07.759
okay?
 

00:23:07.759 --> 00:23:09.170
It's a single company town.
 

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:13.422
All these people who go to
these games basically work in

00:23:13.422 --> 00:23:15.509
the only factory in town.
 

00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:19.076
And let's just imagine that
after five or eight years of

00:23:19.076 --> 00:23:22.058
this when he's getting close to
retirement,

00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:26.348
and he's not playing such good
basketball anymore anyway,

00:23:26.348 --> 00:23:29.417
Wilt says to himself,
"You know what I'm going

00:23:29.417 --> 00:23:29.910
to do?
 

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.239
I'm going to buy the only
factory in town,"

00:23:33.239 --> 00:23:36.710
and he buys the factory in
which they all work.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:41.983
And so he now owns the factory,
Pareto superior transaction,

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:44.130
voluntary transaction.
 

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:47.574
He uses these millions he's
accumulated from all of their

00:23:47.574 --> 00:23:49.420
quarters to buy the factory.
 

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:52.460
But times are tough.
 

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.328
There's globalization coming
along.

00:23:55.328 --> 00:23:59.086
The factory's losing money,
and his manager says to him,

00:23:59.086 --> 00:24:03.048
"You've got to massively
cut your wages here."

00:24:03.048 --> 00:24:08.838
And so he gets into a
confrontation with the workers,

00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:13.266
and they won't back down,
and his company he thinks is

00:24:13.266 --> 00:24:16.690
not making as much money as it
should,

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.193
and so he says, "Well,
unless you take a seventy

00:24:20.193 --> 00:24:25.365
percent pay cut,
I'm moving this company to

00:24:25.365 --> 00:24:27.568
Mexico."
 

00:24:27.568 --> 00:24:30.877
So they are,
in effect, forced to take a

00:24:30.877 --> 00:24:35.799
seventy percent pay cut as a
result of this transaction.

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:36.299
Now what about that?
 

00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:38.910
What would Nozick say?
 

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:43.960
 
 

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.609
What would Nozick say about
that?

00:24:45.609 --> 00:24:51.150
 
 

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:55.058
Nozick would be fine with it,
wouldn't he?

00:24:55.058 --> 00:24:59.880
Yeah, that's the way the cookie
crumbles, right?

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.673
"Losses must lie where
they fall"

00:25:04.673 --> 00:25:10.721
is a famous line from an
American judge called Learned

00:25:10.721 --> 00:25:11.750
Hand.
 

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.528
That's what happened.
 

00:25:13.528 --> 00:25:16.759
They chose to give him all of
this money.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:21.278
Maybe they didn't anticipate
what he was going to do with it,

00:25:21.278 --> 00:25:25.815
but that was then and this is
now, and he's entitled to do

00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:28.598
whatever he wants with his
money.

00:25:28.598 --> 00:25:37.430
How many people think that
changes this thing?

00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:42.694
If we doctor Nozick's example
in this way does anybody think

00:25:42.694 --> 00:25:47.247
it changes anything,
somebody who previously thought

00:25:47.247 --> 00:25:50.549
it was okay but now is less
sure?

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.329
There's nobody?
 

00:25:52.329 --> 00:25:53.980
Yeah? Why?
 

00:25:53.980 --> 00:26:06.380
Let's get the mic there yeah,
over here, yeah?

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.308
Yeah.
 

00:26:08.308 --> 00:26:09.848
Student: I don't have a real
explanation.

00:26:09.848 --> 00:26:13.221
I just think it's morally wrong
because it's kind of coercing

00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:15.920
the people to go by his money
and everything,

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.070
while before he was just kind
of earning money for his own

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.828
happiness,
and his own utility, I guess.

00:26:21.828 --> 00:26:25.106
In this case he's using his
money and it seems to have bad

00:26:25.106 --> 00:26:27.981
moral implications,
so that's why I'm slightly more

00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:29.650
uneasy with this outcome.
 

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.150
Professor Ian Shapiro:
So it's what he's doing with

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:33.500
it.
 

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:37.380
He's taking advantage of the
situation in some way?

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.098
Student: I guess so, yeah.
 

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:46.843
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Well, anyone want to disagree

00:26:46.843 --> 00:26:48.430
with that?
 

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.328
Yeah?
 

00:26:51.328 --> 00:26:53.460
Student: Well,
I think it changes the

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.128
situation in a different way in
that now we're have coercion of

00:26:57.128 --> 00:27:00.442
a group of people to keep the
pattern of Wilt Chamberlain

00:27:00.442 --> 00:27:02.160
being in charge intact.
 

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.463
So even though it does seem at
first glance like a mutually

00:27:06.463 --> 00:27:10.694
beneficial arrangement it seems
as though people are being

00:27:10.694 --> 00:27:15.000
coerced into doing something in
order to maintain a...

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:16.808
Professor Ian Shapiro:
But where's the coercion?

00:27:16.808 --> 00:27:19.386
Student: Well,
they're being coerced into

00:27:19.386 --> 00:27:23.383
taking this pay cut even though
it seems as though a really bad

00:27:23.383 --> 00:27:24.930
move for them,
so...

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:28.541
I mean, they have no choices,
so I guess they've been back

00:27:28.541 --> 00:27:30.190
into this corner,
but...

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.935
Prof: Well,
they have the choice of not

00:27:32.935 --> 00:27:34.890
being employed by Wilt,
right?

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.643
Student:  I guess so.
 

00:27:36.643 --> 00:27:37.519
I don't know.
 

00:27:37.519 --> 00:27:41.488
Prof: We have this essay
question which some of you are

00:27:41.488 --> 00:27:42.920
probably working on.
 

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:46.173
Joan Robinson's line,
"The one thing worse than

00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:48.980
being exploited is not being
exploited,"

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.930
but he's saying,
"I'm choosing to close

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:56.700
down my factory and move it to
Mexico.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.000
I'm not coercing you.
 

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.450
I just don't want to run a
factory at a loss."

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:12.098
 
 

00:28:12.098 --> 00:28:18.759
Most people wouldn't allow the
market to run indefinitely.

00:28:18.759 --> 00:28:23.517
So for instance,
we have laws if you have a

00:28:23.517 --> 00:28:30.428
hurricane and there's no water
in a part of the country that's

00:28:30.428 --> 00:28:35.997
been hit by the hurricane,
and the local hardware store

00:28:35.997 --> 00:28:40.111
with bottled water suddenly
ramps up the price a thousand

00:28:40.111 --> 00:28:40.920
percent.
 

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.900
We call it price gouging.
 

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.509
It's an evil thing.
 

00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:50.702
But he would say,
"Look, the demand for

00:28:50.702 --> 00:28:52.559
water just went way up.
 

00:28:52.559 --> 00:28:55.088
I have water.
 

00:28:55.088 --> 00:28:59.598
Why should it be price
gouging?"

00:28:59.598 --> 00:29:09.446
So that's the point of the
outsourcing example,

00:29:09.446 --> 00:29:11.160
right?
 

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.646
The point is,
at some point most people are

00:29:14.646 --> 00:29:18.134
going to say,
"No, we can't just allow

00:29:18.134 --> 00:29:19.380
the market.
 

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:23.768
We have to pay attention to the
context in which people are

00:29:23.768 --> 00:29:26.720
buying water right after a
hurricane.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.374
Through no fault of their own,
the price of water has

00:29:29.374 --> 00:29:33.430
skyrocketed,
and so we're going to have laws

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:38.950
to punish people who engage in
price gouging."

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:46.839
Who thinks that we should have
laws against price gouging?

00:29:46.839 --> 00:29:48.318
Yeah?
 

00:29:48.318 --> 00:29:52.458
Now, if we should have laws
against price gouging shouldn't

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:57.240
we have laws against the sort of
thing that Wilt Chamberlain is,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.710
in my modification of Nozick's
example,

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:04.470
is proposing to do?
 

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:10.046
Anyone think we should have
laws against price gouging,

00:30:10.046 --> 00:30:14.900
but we shouldn't have laws
limiting what--no?

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.538
Is that right?
 

00:30:16.538 --> 00:30:23.587
What he's threatening to do is
like price gouging,

00:30:23.587 --> 00:30:30.349
or anybody think it's not like
price gouging?

00:30:30.349 --> 00:30:31.818
So what's the difference? Yeah?
 

00:30:31.818 --> 00:30:34.319
Student:  No,
I was thinking it's like Mill's

00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:37.838
harm principle a little bit,
so maybe you could actually

00:30:37.838 --> 00:30:42.134
find for price gouging and for
Wilt Chamberlain a reason to

00:30:42.134 --> 00:30:46.726
allow a government to say that
you're not allowed to do it even

00:30:46.726 --> 00:30:51.170
though it seems perfectly fine
as a market transaction.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:55.068
Prof: But what is the
difference exactly?

00:30:55.068 --> 00:30:58.051
Student:  I'm saying
they're similar because they

00:30:58.051 --> 00:30:59.680
both involve harming people.
 

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.693
Prof: They both involve
harming people,

00:31:02.693 --> 00:31:06.380
but the price gouging is worse
somehow than what Wilt is

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.720
proposing to do?
 

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.788
Student:  I'm not saying
that it's necessarily worse.

00:31:11.788 --> 00:31:14.270
It could be,
but I don't have a definite

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:15.480
reason to say so.
 

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.778
Prof: So I think
Nozick's point is going to be,

00:31:18.778 --> 00:31:23.548
"Well, anytime you're
going to step in,

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:28.196
anytime the government is going
to step in and say this crosses

00:31:28.196 --> 00:31:32.618
some line where even though it's
voluntary transactions,

00:31:32.618 --> 00:31:37.549
they're not voluntary in any
meaningful sense because people

00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:39.890
are such extremists."
 

00:31:39.890 --> 00:31:45.684
The price-gouging situation is
an example, but you're still

00:31:45.684 --> 00:31:50.382
going to have to say,
"Well, how do we know

00:31:50.382 --> 00:31:53.180
where to draw that line?
 

00:31:53.180 --> 00:32:00.523
When is it going to be the case
that the position we're putting

00:32:00.523 --> 00:32:05.026
people in and saying
"choose"

00:32:05.026 --> 00:32:10.118
is so bad that the government
steps in?

00:32:10.118 --> 00:32:15.403
Is it when they're about to
die, or is it not quite that

00:32:15.403 --> 00:32:15.980
far?
 

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.400
Where are we going to decide?
 

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:21.574
What is the point at which we
step in and start making

00:32:21.574 --> 00:32:24.150
interpersonal judgments of
utility?"

00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:25.858
That's what we're really
saying, right?

00:32:25.858 --> 00:32:29.160
We're saying,
"At some point we're going

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:32.402
to step in,
the state's going to step in,

00:32:32.402 --> 00:32:37.088
but we don't have a very good
account of at what point."

00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:40.454
Because if you say,
"At no point is the state

00:32:40.454 --> 00:32:43.819
going to step in,"
then you're really back to

00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:47.529
saying in the example we talked
about way back with the

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:51.443
Edgeworth Box that the bag lady
should die because she has

00:32:51.443 --> 00:32:54.984
nothing that Trump wants,
and so that's the Pareto

00:32:54.984 --> 00:32:55.890
efficient result.
 

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.769
But if you want to say,
"Well,

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:02.086
at some point before that
point, the state should step

00:33:02.086 --> 00:33:05.088
in," you need some account
of what it is.

00:33:05.088 --> 00:33:14.608
And given that things happen
and circumstances change,

00:33:14.608 --> 00:33:19.395
just saying if the initial
conditions were just and the

00:33:19.395 --> 00:33:24.358
transactions were voluntary the
outcome must be just,

00:33:24.358 --> 00:33:28.803
isn't going to be satisfying in
every instance because the

00:33:28.803 --> 00:33:30.440
status quo changes.
 

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.929
There can be drift,
if you like,

00:33:32.929 --> 00:33:35.740
utility drift,
in the status quo.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:42.419
And different people will think
the state should get involved at

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:46.098
different points,
but there are very people,

00:33:46.098 --> 00:33:47.946
I think,
who are going to go all the way

00:33:47.946 --> 00:33:50.345
and say,
"Well, the bag lady should

00:33:50.345 --> 00:33:52.920
just die,"
or "All these people

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.980
should lose their jobs."
 

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.990
Maybe that'll be a more
difficult case for some of you

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:02.381
than for others,
but it doesn't seem very

00:34:02.381 --> 00:34:07.585
credible to say you're not going
to have any point at which we're

00:34:07.585 --> 00:34:10.920
going to say the state should
step in.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.960
But now Nozick would want to
say, "Well,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:21.349
even if I conceded that,
we really want to keep it to a

00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:27.920
minimum because the problem is
we don't agree.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.150
The problem about having any
pattern or end-state conception

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:35.809
of what's allowable in society
is we don't agree.

00:34:35.809 --> 00:34:39.420
We have deep pluralism of
values in this society.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.548
What some people think is right
other people don't think is

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:47.311
right,
and why should the people who

00:34:47.311 --> 00:34:53.340
are in the majority get to
impose their view on everybody

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.309
else,
or indeed, why should people

00:34:56.309 --> 00:35:00.307
who are in a minority get to
impose their view on anybody

00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:00.880
else?
 

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.204
Why should anybody get to
impose their view on anybody

00:35:04.204 --> 00:35:05.018
else?"
 

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:09.278
That's his claim,
and we saw in the last lecture

00:35:09.278 --> 00:35:13.992
that he made a distinction
between redistribution and

00:35:13.992 --> 00:35:16.440
compensation,
remember?

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:22.454
He said that we would only get
the minimal state as a result of

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:27.500
forcible inclusion of
independents if they could,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.978
in principle,
be compensated making it

00:35:29.978 --> 00:35:30.849
legitimate.
 

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:34.260
We wouldn't get anything more
because people don't agree.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.840
So some people would say it's
terrible for people to lose

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.440
their jobs.
 

00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:39.329
Others would say,
"Oh well,

00:35:39.329 --> 00:35:41.565
they should have thought about
that when they were putting all

00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:44.079
those quarters in the box,
that they're giving him

00:35:44.079 --> 00:35:44.900
power."
 

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:52.273
So if you cast your mind back
to last week's lecture on

00:35:52.273 --> 00:35:56.309
Wednesday,
we ended up saying, "Well,

00:35:56.309 --> 00:36:00.141
Nozick's argument isn't as
powerful as it looks because we

00:36:00.141 --> 00:36:03.974
could do more in the name of
compensation than he wants to

00:36:03.974 --> 00:36:05.320
do," right?
 

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:11.630
We could allow the creation of
unemployment insurance.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:16.309
Remember there's the fear of
being unemployed in all of that.

00:36:16.309 --> 00:36:23.110
So he might agree about that
but say, "It's still better

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:27.760
to think in a compensatory
idiom."

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:30.592
For one thing,
yes, you might get unemployment

00:36:30.592 --> 00:36:33.740
insurance that way,
but think of all the things the

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.190
welfare state does.
 

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:42.094
It gives protection to the
disabled, it gives civil rights

00:36:42.094 --> 00:36:43.670
guarantees.
 

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:48.681
These are all sorts of things
that wouldn't come about because

00:36:48.681 --> 00:36:51.639
not enough people would want
them.

00:36:51.639 --> 00:36:54.989
The disabled are a minority.
 

00:36:54.989 --> 00:36:58.264
The African Americans before
the Civil Rights Act were a

00:36:58.264 --> 00:37:01.018
minority,
so they wouldn't be able to

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:05.550
force everybody to accept what
they wanted so it wouldn't get

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.855
done as a result of the kind of
mechanism that creates the

00:37:09.855 --> 00:37:11.289
minimal state.
 

00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:14.869
There'd be a lot of things
government currently does that

00:37:14.869 --> 00:37:16.018
wouldn't happen.
 

00:37:16.018 --> 00:37:20.505
And it's better to have
compensation rather than

00:37:20.505 --> 00:37:24.610
redistribution,
because compensation doesn't

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:28.429
require us to agree about a
pattern.

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:32.496
It doesn't require us to agree
on what kind of outcome is

00:37:32.496 --> 00:37:33.659
actually just.
 

00:37:33.659 --> 00:37:40.550
The whole idea of compensation
is making somebody whole.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:45.916
If one of you walks up to the
street and punches me in the

00:37:45.916 --> 00:37:49.114
face,
and I go to court and sue you,

00:37:49.114 --> 00:37:53.922
the question is what damage did
that angry student do to Ian

00:37:53.922 --> 00:37:56.896
Shapiro,
and how much should Shapiro be

00:37:56.896 --> 00:38:00.690
compensated to put him on at
least as high an indifference

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:05.820
curve as he was before that,
right? That's the only question.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:10.440
We don't have to ask the
question, should he have been

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.360
where he was before?
 

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.119
Is the distribution of wealth
in society that existed before

00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:21.800
Shapiro was punched by the angry
student, was that just?

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:23.239
We don't have to ask that
question.

00:38:23.239 --> 00:38:26.262
If we're going to do
compensation we just say,

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:28.750
"How do we make Shapiro
whole?

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.000
How does the person who harmed
him make him whole?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.257
How much money does he have to
give him to make him

00:38:34.257 --> 00:38:34.889
whole?"
 

00:38:34.889 --> 00:38:38.130
That's the only question we
have to answer.

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:43.630
And Nozick wants to say that
it's a much easier thing to deal

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:48.487
with precisely because in a
society where there's deep

00:38:48.487 --> 00:38:52.960
pluralism of values,
where we don't agree on what's

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.929
just,
it's a much more limited

00:38:55.929 --> 00:39:00.849
inquiry into how do we
compensate some particular

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:06.385
individual to undo the
particular harm that was done to

00:39:06.385 --> 00:39:09.460
them and make them whole.
 

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.742
We don't have to agree on what
the just distribution of wealth

00:39:13.742 --> 00:39:18.097
and income in this society is in
order to answer that question,

00:39:18.097 --> 00:39:18.800
right?
 

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:24.813
Is that a good argument that
compensation is much less

00:39:24.813 --> 00:39:30.260
demanding metaphysically than
redistribution,

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:35.398
because compensation doesn't
require us to agree on what is

00:39:35.398 --> 00:39:36.018
just.
 

00:39:36.018 --> 00:39:43.025
It just requires us to figure
out how much is owed to Shapiro

00:39:43.025 --> 00:39:49.679
to make him whole after this
harm has been done to him.

00:39:49.679 --> 00:39:52.510
Yeah? Is it a good argument?
 

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.034
Student:  Just because
it's easy doesn't mean it's the

00:39:55.034 --> 00:39:55.750
right argument.
 

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:58.472
Prof: Just because it's
easy doesn't mean it's the right

00:39:58.472 --> 00:39:59.659
argument, but is it easy?
 

00:39:59.659 --> 00:40:01.161
Student:  Well,
you said it was,

00:40:01.161 --> 00:40:02.030
just metaphysically.
 

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:06.949
Prof: It's easy in one
sense.

00:40:06.949 --> 00:40:10.300
I mean it might be hard because
I'm going to say,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.909
"Pain and suffering,
and I was humiliated,

00:40:13.909 --> 00:40:16.570
and I've got to get extra money
for that,

00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:22.730
and my girlfriend won't look at
me because I've got a black eye,

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:24.420
I should get extra money for
that."

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.969
We'll argue about this in
court, so it might be hard in

00:40:27.969 --> 00:40:31.818
that sense,
but it's easier in the sense

00:40:31.818 --> 00:40:38.197
that we don't need to agree on
what my salary should be versus

00:40:38.197 --> 00:40:41.284
a banker's salary,
versus--you know,

00:40:41.284 --> 00:40:43.360
we don't have to answer
questions like that.

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:47.206
We just want to know the
number--we have to arrive at the

00:40:47.206 --> 00:40:50.230
number to undo the harm,
to make me whole.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.820
Is that a bad argument?
 

00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:54.086
Yeah?
 

00:40:54.086 --> 00:40:56.599
Student:  Well,
it completely forgets the

00:40:56.599 --> 00:40:59.538
Enlightenment idea that there
might be a right answer to

00:40:59.538 --> 00:41:02.677
anything,
and just by saying that you're

00:41:02.677 --> 00:41:07.586
just dealing in compensation and
not actually redistribution and

00:41:07.586 --> 00:41:08.989
figuring out...
 

00:41:08.989 --> 00:41:10.905
Prof: I mean,
yeah, that's a good point,

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:14.606
but I think Nozick would say,
"I'm not saying there

00:41:14.606 --> 00:41:16.610
isn't a right answer.
 

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:19.768
I'm saying we don't agree on
what the right answer is,

00:41:19.768 --> 00:41:23.027
but I, Nozick,
am saying one right answer's

00:41:23.027 --> 00:41:28.146
not to coerce people,
so given that we have different

00:41:28.146 --> 00:41:31.300
values the answer is liberty.
 

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.036
Let everybody have their own
value and not impose one

00:41:35.036 --> 00:41:37.409
person's value on others."
 

00:41:37.409 --> 00:41:39.380
So I don't think he'd back down
that quickly.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.259
Is there any other reason
anyone might think this is--I

00:41:43.259 --> 00:41:47.353
think you're in the right
direction, but you haven't quite

00:41:47.353 --> 00:41:48.360
nailed it.
 

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:48.590
Yeah?
 

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.849
Student:  So,
I mean, in terms of money,

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:52.960
maybe it's easier to think
about compensation,

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.824
but when you're compensating
people with goods or services

00:41:55.824 --> 00:41:58.690
you're really having to take
those from somewhere else.

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.050
They don't just appear out of
nowhere.

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:04.626
So, on some level you're
already redistributing things

00:42:04.626 --> 00:42:06.449
when you're compensating.
 

00:42:06.449 --> 00:42:10.675
So it is really just another
form of redistribution,

00:42:10.675 --> 00:42:12.500
but in another word.
 

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:13.989
Prof: I think that's a
good argument,

00:42:13.989 --> 00:42:17.625
but I think there's another one
that I just want to leave you

00:42:17.625 --> 00:42:21.862
with,
and this partly reflects when

00:42:21.862 --> 00:42:24.449
Nozick was writing.
 

00:42:24.449 --> 00:42:27.467
He wrote this in 1974,
and in 1974,

00:42:27.467 --> 00:42:32.793
there was a lot more political
stability in the world in some

00:42:32.793 --> 00:42:36.699
ways than there came to be
subsequently.

00:42:36.699 --> 00:42:39.789
Of course it was unstable in
the sense that we were in the

00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:43.574
middle of the Cold War,
but the Cold War provided a lot

00:42:43.574 --> 00:42:48.097
of stability within countries
that would subsequently become

00:42:48.097 --> 00:42:51.699
very unstable after the end of
the Cold War.

00:42:51.699 --> 00:42:57.286
And so this idea that,
well, fixing one injustice is

00:42:57.286 --> 00:43:01.780
something we can get our minds
around,

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.032
particularly if it means making
people as well-off as they were

00:43:06.032 --> 00:43:08.652
before,
whereas deciding what's just

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:11.000
for the society as a whole
isn't.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.771
It's a much bigger problem,
and it is potentially much more

00:43:15.771 --> 00:43:20.568
politically explosive,
because we're going to be,

00:43:20.568 --> 00:43:23.331
as Nozick says,
"Liberty upsets

00:43:23.331 --> 00:43:24.110
patterns."
 

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:26.847
We're going to be taking wealth
from some people and giving it

00:43:26.847 --> 00:43:28.913
to other people,
and the people we're taking it

00:43:28.913 --> 00:43:30.440
from are not going to like it.
 

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.550
Whereas this compensatory idiom
is backward-looking,

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.210
it's focused and it's specific.
 

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:44.284
But I think what he didn't take
account of is that the

00:43:44.284 --> 00:43:53.230
backward-looking idiom runs into
the problem of where do we stop.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.000
Where do we stop?
 

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.429
After 1991, there were people
in Russia who said,

00:43:58.429 --> 00:44:02.501
"All that property should
be given back to the czar's

00:44:02.501 --> 00:44:03.860
children."
 

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:12.730
After the transition in South
Africa King Goodwill Zwelithini,

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:16.190
the Zulu King,
he said, "Well,

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:20.188
all that land that was seized
first by the British from my

00:44:20.188 --> 00:44:23.664
ancestors,
and then under apartheid was

00:44:23.664 --> 00:44:28.429
seized again for the forced
removals and all that,

00:44:28.429 --> 00:44:30.530
it should be given to me.
 

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.730
I'm the descendant."
 

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.594
And you only have to think
about the Middle East to see

00:44:37.594 --> 00:44:42.099
that this idea that a
backward-looking compensatory

00:44:42.099 --> 00:44:47.144
idiom is less politically
explosive than a redistributive

00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:51.289
idiom as a political matter
isn't true,

00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:53.949
because it all depends how far
you go back.

00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:59.250
The Palestinians say we go back
to 1967,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.449
or then there's the debate
about going back to 1948,

00:45:02.449 --> 00:45:04.059
and there are many people who
are there that say,

00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:08.172
"We should go back to the
Old Testament as to where we

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:12.143
should undo all the injustices
that are piled up upon one

00:45:12.143 --> 00:45:14.130
another over time."
 

00:45:14.130 --> 00:45:18.940
So this idea that the
compensatory idiom is less

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:23.956
demanding than the
redistributive idiom I think is

00:45:23.956 --> 00:45:29.994
politically naive and ultimately
philosophically not tenable

00:45:29.994 --> 00:45:36.135
because you're going to have to
make a decision about how far

00:45:36.135 --> 00:45:42.175
back to go before you decide
that you have the benchmark for

00:45:42.175 --> 00:45:44.530
compensation.
 

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:48.847
You only have to look at the
vexed history of affirmative

00:45:48.847 --> 00:45:51.952
action which was,
you know, read Randall

00:45:51.952 --> 00:45:54.085
Robinson's book,
The Debt,

00:45:54.085 --> 00:45:56.329
the vexed history of
affirmative action,

00:45:56.329 --> 00:46:00.713
to see how difficult a
backward-looking compensatory

00:46:00.713 --> 00:46:03.809
idiom turns out to be in
practice.

00:46:03.809 --> 00:46:08.449
Enjoy the midterm and we'll see
you three weeks from today.

00:46:08.449 --> 00:46:14.000

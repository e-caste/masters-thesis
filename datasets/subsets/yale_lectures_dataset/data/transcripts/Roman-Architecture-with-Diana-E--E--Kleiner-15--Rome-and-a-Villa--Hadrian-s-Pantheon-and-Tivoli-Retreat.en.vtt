00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.552
Prof: Good morning
everyone, and welcome back,

00:00:04.552 --> 00:00:06.960
after what I hope was a great
spring break.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.810
This lecture,
that I'm going to deliver this

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.097
morning,
has been an inspiration to

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:15.513
students who have selected
Option 3 for their paper topic:

00:00:15.513 --> 00:00:18.030
"How to design a Roman
city."

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.880
Because this lecture has it all.
 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.941
It has great architecture;
it has an extraordinary patron

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.790
-- a man who traveled the
Empire,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.031
to all kinds of exotic places,
some of which we'll be talking

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.165
about today and some of which
we'll be talking about in the

00:00:34.165 --> 00:00:36.320
future;
a love triangle;

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.908
some of the best buildings that
we'll see in the course of this

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:45.275
semester, including the Pantheon
and also Hadrian's Villa at

00:00:45.275 --> 00:00:46.090
Tivoli.
 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.258
The patron Hadrian,
whom I show you in a portrait

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:54.601
from Rome, now on the left-hand
side of the screen,

00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:57.120
was an extraordinary man.
 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.093
He was born in 76 A.D.,
and he became emperor at the

00:01:03.093 --> 00:01:09.768
age of 41, after having served
with Trajan for a number of

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:10.938
years.
 

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:13.200
He was born,
like Trajan before him,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.448
in Spain, not in Italy,
and he also was the most

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:21.817
educated,
one of the most educated,

00:01:21.817 --> 00:01:25.470
and most intellectual of the
Roman emperors.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.459
We'll talk about the impact
that that intellect had on his

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:30.510
architecture.
 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.879
I mentioned that he already--he
also liked to travel.

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.150
He traveled extensively during
his reign,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.658
had three major trips that had
an enormous impact on his

00:01:41.658 --> 00:01:47.346
architecture,
and also on architecture around

00:01:47.346 --> 00:01:49.040
the Empire.
 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.397
And it's also important I think
to know that he reversed

00:01:51.397 --> 00:01:52.170
Trajan's policy.
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.783
You'll remember that Trajan's
major political policy had to do

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.418
with military conquest,
that Trajan was involved in a

00:02:00.418 --> 00:02:05.004
number of very important wars,
and he celebrated those wars,

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:10.020
and he extended the Empire to
its furthest reaches,

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.540
reaches that were never gone
beyond for the rest of the Roman

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.919
Empire.
 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.289
Hadrian reversed that policy.
 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:16.800
He was a peace loving man.
 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.343
He had no interest in being
involved in these kinds of

00:02:21.343 --> 00:02:24.159
military exploits;
although he had served with

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.789
Trajan in some of them,
in earlier years,

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:27.419
he had no desire to continue
that on.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:32.220
And he was much more concerned
with consolidating and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.560
preserving the Empire,
as expanded by Trajan.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.294
And so one of his greatest
claims to fame is the great

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:43.970
wall,
the famous Wall of Hadrian that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.068
he built in order to separate
the Roman Empire,

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:51.068
the Greco-Roman Empire,
from the rest of the Empire,

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:55.254
this great wall that divided
Greco-Roman civilization from

00:02:55.254 --> 00:02:58.120
the barbarian world that lay
outside.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.542
And there are fragments of that
wall, a quite extensive part of

00:03:03.542 --> 00:03:07.740
that wall that still survives in
Europe today.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.330
You can see it in Britain,
and I show you an example of

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.986
some of those remains here on
the right-hand side of the

00:03:14.986 --> 00:03:17.580
screen, that is,
of Hadrian's Wall.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.278
Hadrian was also a great
philhellene, and you notice in

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:25.389
that portrait that I just showed
you that he wore a beard.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.806
And, in fact,
he's the first Roman emperor to

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:28.628
wear a beard.
 

00:03:28.628 --> 00:03:31.400
Beards were not worn by Romans
up to this time,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.424
but they were worn by Greeks,
and we believe that he wore

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:36.229
that beard,
in large part,

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.729
to look more Greek.
 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.247
We also know that,
although he wore a toga in

00:03:40.247 --> 00:03:42.836
public,
he was known for wearing the

00:03:42.836 --> 00:03:46.127
Greek himation,
in private, and he did that,

00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:48.996
we think,
in large part because of his

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.860
love for Greece and for Greek
culture.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.711
He was so philhellenic in his
leanings that he received the

00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:56.384
nickname "The
Greekling,"

00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:59.391
and we'll see,
as we look at his architecture,

00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:03.468
the impact that his love of
Greece had on that architecture.

00:04:03.468 --> 00:04:07.061
In fact, what I'd like to do
today is to begin with the most

00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:11.314
Greek of Hadrian's buildings,
a building that we think he may

00:04:11.314 --> 00:04:14.955
have designed himself,
because we also know that

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:17.480
Hadrian was an amateur
architect;

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.569
Hadrian himself was an amateur
architect.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.324
And we think he designed this
very building,

00:04:23.324 --> 00:04:25.949
the so-called Temple of Venus
and Roma.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.362
He was also particularly
interested, by the way,

00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:29.800
in religious architecture.
 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.750
Most of his public building was
religious architecture,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.857
temples, this being one of
them: the Temple of Venus and

00:04:35.857 --> 00:04:37.711
Roma,
a temple put up to Roma,

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:40.279
as the patron goddess of the
city of Rome,

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:44.420
and to Venus as the patron
goddess of the Roman family.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.250
And you'll remember that Venus
was a special favorite of Julius

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.232
Caesar,
and of Augustus,

00:04:50.232 --> 00:04:55.598
and those two thought of her as
the special patron of the Julian

00:04:55.598 --> 00:04:56.449
family.
 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.000
So we also see Hadrian here,
conjuring up,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.028
I think, his connections to the
earlier dictators and emperor

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:08.269
Julius Caesar,
and Augustus,

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:10.470
by his emphasis on Venus.
 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.420
So this Temple to Venus and
Roma.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.009
You'll see that we don't have a
precise date for this monument.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.300
We think it was put up sometime
between 121 and 135.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.430
We know it was dedicated in 135.
 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.500
It seems to have been long in
the making.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.589
So it's hard to categorize it
as either an early- or a mid- or

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:35.002
a late-Hadrianic building,
because it does seem to have

00:05:35.002 --> 00:05:36.420
been in production for quite
some time.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.670
I show you two plans of the
Temple of Venus and Roma,

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.994
because there's controversy
about which plan most accurately

00:05:44.994 --> 00:05:48.000
reflects the original Hadrianic
temple.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.925
Because we know the temple was
-- while it was built under

00:05:51.925 --> 00:05:56.264
Hadrian and dedicated in 135,
we know that it burned down in

00:05:56.264 --> 00:06:01.038
a very serious fire in Rome,
in the late third century A.D.,

00:06:01.038 --> 00:06:04.360
and then was renovated by an
emperor,

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.920
whom we'll talk about later in
the semester,

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.519
by the name of Maxentius,
M-a-x-e-n-t-i-u-s;

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:14.709
it was renovated by Maxentius
in 307 A.D.

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.014
And we think Maxentius kept
quite closely to the original

00:06:19.014 --> 00:06:22.396
Hadrianic plan,
but we're not absolutely sure

00:06:22.396 --> 00:06:23.550
about that.
 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.295
So that some of the
discrepancies that you see

00:06:26.295 --> 00:06:29.956
between these two plans may have
to do with the discrepancies

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:33.740
between the original building
and the eventual renovation.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.620
But you will see that in the
main these two plans--

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.136
and the one on the left-hand
side of the screen is the one

00:06:39.136 --> 00:06:41.829
that's on your Monument List
that you have in front of you.

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:45.117
The one on the right-hand side
of the screen is the one in your

00:06:45.117 --> 00:06:46.389
Ward-Perkins textbook.
 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:49.410
But if you look at its most
outstanding features,

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:53.009
you will see that most of them
are similar to one another,

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:54.860
that the main features of these
two buildings--

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.800
of these two plans--are the
same.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.170
And you should be immediately
struck by these plans,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.475
both of these plans,
and how different they are from

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:09.170
what we have characterized as
the typical Roman temple;

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.620
that typical Roman temple,
usually with a single cella,

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.096
with a deep porch,
with freestanding columns in

00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:16.697
that porch,
with a façade

00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:17.250
orientation.
 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.514
This is very different indeed,
no matter which of these two

00:07:20.514 --> 00:07:21.639
plans you look at.
 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.740
Because you will see that this
large temple has a double cella,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.540
two cellas, back-to-back--and
you see it in both plans--

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.970
two cellas back-to-back.
 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.427
Well the reason for that is
obvious, because it commemorates

00:07:34.427 --> 00:07:36.185
two divinities,
Venus and Roma,

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:38.529
and each one needed to have a
cella.

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:43.000
But these are not cellas within
a larger cella,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.742
located side by side,
as in the Capitoline Triad

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:48.937
Temple,
but rather two that are

00:07:48.937 --> 00:07:51.379
back-to-back,
two that are back-to-back.

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:56.105
Now what this does is take away
the façade orientation of

00:07:56.105 --> 00:07:59.704
the building and give us two
facades, in a sense,

00:07:59.704 --> 00:08:01.430
one on either side.
 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.079
So we see that in both of these.
 

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:07.702
We also see that the columns go
all the way around the

00:08:07.702 --> 00:08:11.598
structure, and so does the
staircase go all the way around

00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:14.278
the structure;
we see that in both plans.

00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:17.915
And then there is a large
precinct that also has columns

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:18.709
around it.
 

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:21.887
I can also tell you,
you can take on faith,

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:25.139
that this building also has a
low podium.

00:08:25.139 --> 00:08:29.745
So what we see here is a temple
that looks much more Greek than

00:08:29.745 --> 00:08:31.711
it looks Roman;
in fact, as I said,

00:08:31.711 --> 00:08:33.893
it doesn't look anything like
the typical Roman temples that

00:08:33.893 --> 00:08:35.149
we've been talking about today.
 

00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:36.320
Why is this?
 

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.389
This has to do with the fact
that Hadrian was a philhellene,

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:41.480
that he was enamored of Greek
architecture,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.244
and that he opted,
in this case when he himself

00:08:44.244 --> 00:08:47.548
appears to have been the
architect of this building,

00:08:47.548 --> 00:08:51.587
Hadrian, amateur architect,
seems to have designed this

00:08:51.587 --> 00:08:53.009
building himself.
 

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:56.958
We see that when he was left
entirely to his own devices,

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:59.851
he wanted to build a Greek
temple in Rome,

00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.389
and that is exactly what he
did.

00:09:02.389 --> 00:09:05.562
Now also important
vis-à-vis this temple is

00:09:05.562 --> 00:09:07.570
location, location,
location.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:13.306
This building is located at the
edge of the Roman Forum,

00:09:13.306 --> 00:09:18.000
closest to the Colosseum,
and on the Velia;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.562
you'll remember the Velia where
the Arch of Titus is located,

00:09:21.562 --> 00:09:22.750
the Arch of Titus.
 

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.837
And you'll remember that that
was the area that the Flavian

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:30.009
dynasts chose to build their
buildings on,

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:34.932
in order to raze to the ground
Nero's earlier Domus

00:09:34.932 --> 00:09:38.075
Transitoria,
and build their own buildings

00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:38.879
in its place.
 

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:41.980
So we see Hadrian continuing on
in that same tradition,

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.801
returning to the Roman people
land that had originally been

00:09:45.801 --> 00:09:48.650
theirs,
that had been stolen by Nero,

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.703
by building,
in this case,

00:09:50.703 --> 00:09:54.070
a religious structure on that
site instead.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:55.889
So that also extremely
important.

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.058
To get back for a moment to the
plan,

00:09:58.058 --> 00:10:01.206
we see again the major
difference between these two

00:10:01.206 --> 00:10:04.859
versions is that in this case
there is a flat back wall for

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:08.100
each of the individual cellas;
for this one,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.739
a niche on either side,
niches back to back,

00:10:11.739 --> 00:10:15.038
almost kissing,
as you can see here.

00:10:15.038 --> 00:10:17.817
And then you can also see
another difference is the walls

00:10:17.817 --> 00:10:20.149
are very elaborately scalloped
in this plan,

00:10:20.149 --> 00:10:24.014
which we can see in the
Maxentian renovation that still

00:10:24.014 --> 00:10:25.895
exists;
and I'll show it to you in a

00:10:25.895 --> 00:10:26.250
moment.
 

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.000
But again, we're not sure if
that was a Maxentian innovation,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.565
in the early fourth century
A.D., those back-to-back apses

00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:37.259
and scalloped walls,
or whether they come from the

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:40.633
original--
whether they restore what was

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:44.038
in the original Hadrianic
building.

00:10:44.038 --> 00:10:46.494
I tend to prefer the one on the
left because there is every

00:10:46.494 --> 00:10:48.990
evidence that we already have
all of these features in Roman

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.710
architecture.
 

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.389
Think to the Flavian Palace on
the Palatine,

00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:55.456
Domitian's Palace,
where we saw the scalloped

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:58.854
walls in the Aula Regia,
and where we certainly saw

00:10:58.854 --> 00:11:01.009
these niches with vaults of
heaven,

00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:03.830
semi-vaults up above them.
 

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:10.058
So everything was in place to
have that kind of structure;

00:11:10.058 --> 00:11:12.797
so it's certainly not
inconceivable in the Hadrianic

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:13.278
period.
 

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:16.524
Here's a view of the Temple of
Venus and Roma as it looks as if

00:11:16.524 --> 00:11:19.455
you are standing atop the
Colosseum, and taking a picture

00:11:19.455 --> 00:11:20.450
back toward it.
 

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.250
And this is very useful,
because it shows you--

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.601
this is not a high podium,
this is just the difference in

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:29.936
ground level,
once again--ancient ground

00:11:29.936 --> 00:11:34.048
level being lower than modern
ground level--

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:38.744
and some of the structures that
lay below originally of Nero's

00:11:38.744 --> 00:11:41.049
Domus Transitoria,
for example,

00:11:41.049 --> 00:11:42.950
that this building was built
on.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.490
Here you can actually see the
podium of the temple,

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:48.693
and you can see that it is very
low, compared to what we're used

00:11:48.693 --> 00:11:49.048
to.
 

00:11:49.048 --> 00:11:51.470
We're looking back at one of
those niches.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.259
You can see the semi-dome here,
as well as the relationship of

00:11:56.259 --> 00:11:59.489
it to the Arch of Titus,
and the Velia,

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:04.243
which once again points out the
fact that we are dealing here

00:12:04.243 --> 00:12:08.918
with a building that was put on
property that had originally

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:12.960
been the location of Nero's
Domus Transitoria.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.025
Here are three very useful
views, one showing that same

00:12:17.025 --> 00:12:20.340
niche closer up,
taken from the Colosseum;

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.298
one of those back to back
niches, as it looks today.

00:12:23.298 --> 00:12:25.994
And then this one,
over here, which is the other

00:12:25.994 --> 00:12:28.477
niche,
which is preserved inside a

00:12:28.477 --> 00:12:32.486
later building that was
transformed into a museum of the

00:12:32.486 --> 00:12:35.120
Forum Romanum,
at one point.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.678
We see it here,
and you can see in both cases

00:12:37.678 --> 00:12:38.610
the semi-dome.
 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.517
You can see the concrete
construction,

00:12:41.517 --> 00:12:43.009
faced with brick.
 

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:44.491
In this one,
which is better preserved in

00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:46.158
large part because it was in
part indoors,

00:12:46.158 --> 00:12:49.899
we can see the columns on
either side of the niche,

00:12:49.899 --> 00:12:55.048
and we also see that scalloped
wall that I described before,

00:12:55.048 --> 00:12:56.620
just like the Aula Regia,
with niches flanked by columns.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.129
And you can see the beginning
of a coffered vault.

00:12:59.129 --> 00:13:02.384
We're not absolutely sure it
was barrel vaulted,

00:13:02.384 --> 00:13:05.639
but we think the building was
barrel vaulted.

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.149
We also see,
on the left,

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:10.860
I remind you of the octagonal
room designed by Rabirius,

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:17.009
for Domitian's Palace on the
Palatine,

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:20.446
to underscore again the kinds
of experiments that Rabirius was

00:13:20.446 --> 00:13:21.884
making,
that had such an impact,

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.259
as we shall see today,
on Hadrian and his own

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:25.830
architectural designs.
 

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.740
You'll remember that room.
 

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.408
You'll remember that it has a
segmented vault.

00:13:30.408 --> 00:13:33.524
You will remember that it's
treated very much like

00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:37.272
sculpture: that it has niches;
that it has niches within

00:13:37.272 --> 00:13:41.038
niches, windows within niches,
doorways within niches;

00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:43.684
all of them done in an
asymmetrical way,

00:13:43.684 --> 00:13:47.009
that makes the design
particularly interesting.

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:49.950
Rabirius and his architecture,
very influential on Hadrian.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.158
Keep in mind that Hadrian,
once Domitian--

00:13:53.158 --> 00:13:55.870
I mentioned this to you when we
talked about Domitian's Palace--

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.672
once Domitian built that
palace, it was the palace that

00:13:58.672 --> 00:14:00.917
all the emperors,
from that time to the end of

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:02.740
late-antiquity,
lived in.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:03.870
Hadrian was no exception.
 

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.009
When he was in Rome,
he lived in that palace,

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:10.528
and he was therefore seeing and
experiencing the shapes,

00:14:10.528 --> 00:14:13.490
the architectural shapes
designed by Rabirius,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.370
on a daily basis.
 

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:19.379
He liked that octagonal room,
in particular,

00:14:19.379 --> 00:14:24.785
and the others like it in the
palace, and it clearly had an

00:14:24.785 --> 00:14:28.048
impact on him,
as we shall see.

00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:31.152
The last point I want to make
about the Temple of Venus and

00:14:31.152 --> 00:14:33.558
Roma, by the way,
has to do with materials.

00:14:33.558 --> 00:14:36.850
We have been talking about the
increasing use of marble in

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.812
Roman architecture:
under Augustus,

00:14:38.812 --> 00:14:42.186
marble from Luna or Carrara;
under Nero and the Flavians,

00:14:42.186 --> 00:14:44.749
marble from all over the world,
from Asia Minor,

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:46.928
from Africa,
of all different colors.

00:14:46.928 --> 00:14:50.422
Hadrian, the philhellene,
returns to using Greek marble

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:53.649
for his buildings,
and the Temple of Venus and

00:14:53.649 --> 00:14:56.279
Roma is made of Proconnesian
marble,

00:14:56.279 --> 00:15:02.370
P-r-o-c-o-n-n-e-s-i-a-n--I
think I got that right--

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.919
Proconnesian marble that comes
from Greece.

00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:10.000
It's a blue veined marble.
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.591
He was particularly fond of it,
and he used it for the Temple

00:15:13.591 --> 00:15:14.788
of Venus and Roma.
 

00:15:14.788 --> 00:15:18.234
I want to turn from the Temple
of Venus and Roma to the much

00:15:18.234 --> 00:15:20.918
more famous temple that Hadrian
constructed.

00:15:20.918 --> 00:15:23.918
If the Temple of Venus and Roma
was to two gods,

00:15:23.918 --> 00:15:27.745
Venus and Roma,
Hadrian's Pantheon was to all

00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:29.844
the gods,
which is what pantheon

00:15:29.844 --> 00:15:33.059
means,
to all the gods--a temple to

00:15:33.059 --> 00:15:38.870
all the gods that he built in
Rome between 118 and 128 A.D.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:42.956
You see a Google Earth image of
it here, the Pantheon,

00:15:42.956 --> 00:15:45.580
surrounded by modern
structures.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:49.861
It is one of the greatest
masterpieces of architecture of

00:15:49.861 --> 00:15:50.779
all times.
 

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:56.408
In fact, if you were to ask a
group of architectural experts

00:15:56.408 --> 00:16:02.038
to make a list of the ten
greatest buildings ever built,

00:16:02.038 --> 00:16:04.725
it's hard for me to believe
that not every one of them would

00:16:04.725 --> 00:16:07.408
at least list somewhere in that
list of ten the Pantheon;

00:16:07.408 --> 00:16:11.009
not only because it's a great
building in its own right,

00:16:11.009 --> 00:16:14.561
but because it has had such an
enormous impact on architecture

00:16:14.561 --> 00:16:17.850
in Roman times,
as we'll see in later lectures,

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.320
but also on architecture in
post-antique times;

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.428
an extraordinarily influential
building.

00:16:23.428 --> 00:16:25.467
And there are some--and I would
be one of them,

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:28.836
maybe I'd be the only one;
I hope not--who would list the

00:16:28.836 --> 00:16:32.596
Pantheon as the greatest
building ever built by man or

00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:35.149
woman, of any time,
in any place.

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:37.657
And you can see,
as we look at it together

00:16:37.657 --> 00:16:41.509
today, whether you think I come
close or I'm way off the mark on

00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:42.058
that.
 

00:16:42.058 --> 00:16:45.260
But I believe vehemently that
it was the greatest building

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:48.573
ever built, and it remains an
extraordinary structure to see

00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:49.808
and to experience.
 

00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.990
You see it here--oh,
and by the way,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.739
although I mentioned that
Hadrian was an amateur

00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:57.030
architect,
we don't know the name of the

00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:58.509
architect for the Pantheon.
 

00:16:58.509 --> 00:17:00.309
Do I think it was Hadrian?
 

00:17:00.309 --> 00:17:01.559
Absolutely not.
 

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.840
Hadrian was not this good.
 

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:06.460
He was an amateur architect,
not a professional architect.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.970
This is an extraordinary work
of art.

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:13.009
He may have had some input,
he undoubtedly did.

00:17:13.009 --> 00:17:15.656
Because we're going to see that
the Pantheon is at the same time

00:17:15.656 --> 00:17:18.282
complex and simple;
it's also traditional and

00:17:18.282 --> 00:17:19.118
innovative.
 

00:17:19.118 --> 00:17:22.327
And what we're going to see
Hadrian and his architect doing

00:17:22.327 --> 00:17:24.393
here,
and also doing at the Villa at

00:17:24.393 --> 00:17:25.663
Tivoli,
is combining,

00:17:25.663 --> 00:17:28.973
in an extraordinary way,
traditional Roman and

00:17:28.973 --> 00:17:31.548
innovative Roman architecture.
 

00:17:31.548 --> 00:17:34.758
Concrete construction,
and the original vocabulary of

00:17:34.758 --> 00:17:36.856
Greek architecture,
namely columns,

00:17:36.856 --> 00:17:38.769
combined in the same place.
 

00:17:38.769 --> 00:17:42.463
And he was highly influenced in
this regard by his predecessor

00:17:42.463 --> 00:17:43.009
Trajan.
 

00:17:43.009 --> 00:17:45.308
Think of the Markets and Forum
of Trajan,

00:17:45.308 --> 00:17:48.480
the way in which we had
combined, in the same complex,

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:52.920
a traditional forum and a very
innovative marketplace.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.920
We're going to see the same
thing in the Pantheon.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.325
We're going to see the same
thing at Hadrian's Villa at

00:17:59.325 --> 00:18:00.058
Tivoli.
 

00:18:00.058 --> 00:18:04.750
So Trajan exerting--Trajan and
Apollodorus of Damascus,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.009
exerting a very strong
influence, as did Rabirius,

00:18:09.009 --> 00:18:12.048
on the architecture of Hadrian.
 

00:18:12.048 --> 00:18:15.188
Again this Google Earth image
is useful, because it shows us

00:18:15.188 --> 00:18:17.368
the building in its modern
environment.

00:18:17.368 --> 00:18:22.698
But it's important to keep in
mind that the Pantheon in Rome

00:18:22.698 --> 00:18:26.130
was part of a complex in
antiquity,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.553
as most temples were,
temples that were in

00:18:28.553 --> 00:18:32.009
sanctuaries,
temples that were in fora.

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:34.098
We've seen that in the course
of this semester that they

00:18:34.098 --> 00:18:36.036
usually did not stand in
isolation, but were part of

00:18:36.036 --> 00:18:37.099
architectural complexes.
 

00:18:37.099 --> 00:18:38.048
We see that here.
 

00:18:38.048 --> 00:18:40.868
This model is very helpful in
that regard,

00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:44.526
because it shows us that there
was a rectangular forecourt:

00:18:44.526 --> 00:18:48.308
that that forecourt had covered
colonnades on either side;

00:18:48.308 --> 00:18:50.924
that there was some sort of
entranceway here,

00:18:50.924 --> 00:18:53.304
possibly an arch,
possibly an altar also,

00:18:53.304 --> 00:18:55.920
to all the gods,
in front of the temple;

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.720
and then the temple itself,
the Pantheon itself.

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.336
Now this model is also very
useful in the sense that it

00:19:04.336 --> 00:19:08.220
gives you an idea of what you
actually would have seen,

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.868
if you had walked into this
complex,

00:19:11.868 --> 00:19:16.364
into this open rectangular
space, and walked toward the

00:19:16.364 --> 00:19:17.278
Pantheon.
 

00:19:17.278 --> 00:19:19.490
What would you actually have
seen?

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.480
Well all that you would have
actually seen was the porch,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.519
the porch, which had an attic
behind it,

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:31.499
which screened the cylindrical
drum and the dome from the

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:32.298
viewer.
 

00:19:32.298 --> 00:19:35.675
So if you were standing here,
all you would have seen was

00:19:35.675 --> 00:19:36.460
this porch.
 

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.160
Now this porch is very
traditional.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.378
It looks like other Roman
temples, the fronts of facades

00:19:41.378 --> 00:19:44.130
of Roman temples that we've
looked at before.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.692
It looks like other Greek
temples, because what you would

00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:50.873
have seen was the pediment,
columns supporting that

00:19:50.873 --> 00:19:51.700
pediment.
 

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.693
It was a typical Roman temple,
from the front:

00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:57.105
deep porch;
free-standing columns in that

00:19:57.105 --> 00:19:59.089
porch;
single staircase;

00:19:59.089 --> 00:20:00.368
façade orientation.
 

00:20:00.368 --> 00:20:04.250
Very different from the Temple
of Venus and Roma;

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.710
much more Roman looking.
 

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:11.519
And then a high podium;
a high podium,

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:13.778
which we already mentioned the
Temple of Venus and Roma did not

00:20:13.778 --> 00:20:14.068
have.
 

00:20:14.068 --> 00:20:16.142
That's what you would have
seen, as you were standing in

00:20:16.142 --> 00:20:16.670
front of it.
 

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.931
You would have thought,
well this is very much in

00:20:19.931 --> 00:20:22.308
keeping with other Roman
temples.

00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:27.613
But of course there was a
surprise when one walked through

00:20:27.613 --> 00:20:30.500
the doors;
and that is the very essence of

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.060
Hadrianic architecture,
the surprise that one gets when

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:38.048
one actually goes from the
outside of the building into the

00:20:38.048 --> 00:20:39.700
inside of a building.
 

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.343
Before we do that,
I just want to show you the

00:20:42.343 --> 00:20:47.694
back of the cylindrical--
because this traditional porch

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:53.470
shielded a very innovative
cylindrical drum,

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.068
supported by a hemispherical
dome, as you can see here.

00:20:57.068 --> 00:21:00.150
The construction technique the
same,

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.940
as we've seen from the time of
Augustus,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.440
from the time of the Temple of
Mercury at Baia,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.498
the use of concrete
construction,

00:21:07.498 --> 00:21:08.720
faced with brick.
 

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.578
It's more sophisticated here
than it has ever been before,

00:21:12.578 --> 00:21:16.118
and we can see that the
architect has relieved the

00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:20.019
severity of the structure by
adding three cornices--

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:22.670
you can see two of them at
least here;

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:24.960
there's another one down
here--three cornices.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.375
And you can also see very
interestingly these brick

00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:30.923
arches,
which tell us a great deal

00:21:30.923 --> 00:21:34.578
about Roman building practice
during this period,

00:21:34.578 --> 00:21:37.358
especially obviously for the
use of concrete construction.

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:43.398
Because what those were used
for is to help keep the concrete

00:21:43.398 --> 00:21:45.009
from settling.
 

00:21:45.009 --> 00:21:47.979
After the wet concrete had been
poured, those arches keep it

00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:49.588
from settling,
until it dries.

00:21:49.588 --> 00:21:53.425
And then once it dries,
those arches are no longer

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:55.458
needed,
because the building,

00:21:55.458 --> 00:21:58.730
the concrete walls support the
building on their own,

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:03.009
and support the dome on their
own.

00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:05.083
And they're no longer needed,
but of course they're left

00:22:05.083 --> 00:22:07.231
there, and then they have a
certain aesthetic value in the

00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:07.759
aftermath.
 

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:09.769
And so you can see very clearly
here,

00:22:09.769 --> 00:22:12.278
as you look at what is
preserved--and the building is

00:22:12.278 --> 00:22:16.000
extremely well preserved,
the back of the building--you

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.269
can see reference to that
construction.

00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:24.130
These diagrams,
both the plan of the structure,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.470
the cross-section and the
diagram on the left-hand side,

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.505
also give us some very
interesting and important

00:22:30.505 --> 00:22:31.410
information.
 

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:37.013
They show us that the circular
drum was internally half the

00:22:37.013 --> 00:22:39.430
height of the diameter.
 

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:43.448
You can see that in the diagram
on the left-hand side of the

00:22:43.448 --> 00:22:46.115
screen,
of the diameter of the

00:22:46.115 --> 00:22:51.077
structure, and that it was
surmounted by a hemispherical

00:22:51.077 --> 00:22:55.645
dome,
the crown of which is the exact

00:22:55.645 --> 00:22:58.519
distance,
the same exact distance.

00:22:58.519 --> 00:23:03.669
So this was very carefully
orchestrated by the architect to

00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:07.308
achieve what he needed to
achieve here.

00:23:07.308 --> 00:23:11.240
You can also see,
if you look at the plan,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.957
that again the predecessors for
this are clearly the

00:23:14.957 --> 00:23:19.272
frigidaria at Pompeii,
the thermal bath at Baia --

00:23:19.272 --> 00:23:22.798
this round structure with the
radiating apses,

00:23:22.798 --> 00:23:25.819
very similar,
but of course done in much,

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:29.068
much grander scale.
 

00:23:29.068 --> 00:23:32.796
Now with regard to--and this is
the façade of the

00:23:32.796 --> 00:23:34.770
Pantheon,
of course, as it looks

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.410
today--with regard to how they
made this happen,

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:41.259
how they were able to take the
small-scale frigidaria,

00:23:41.259 --> 00:23:44.160
the slightly larger Temple of
Mercury,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.068
the larger still Domus Aurea of
Nero,

00:23:47.068 --> 00:23:48.750
or the domed room in the Domus
Transitoria,

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.730
and turn it into the Pantheon
ultimately,

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.920
has to do in part not only with
the skill of the architects,

00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:00.201
has to do in part also with the
increasing sophistication that

00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:04.132
we've been talking about quite
consistently of the use of

00:24:04.132 --> 00:24:07.009
concrete construction by the
Romans,

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:10.038
but also has to do with the
recipe for concrete.

00:24:10.038 --> 00:24:12.695
We haven't talked about the
recipe for concrete,

00:24:12.695 --> 00:24:15.862
since the time of Caligula,
when we talked about the fact

00:24:15.862 --> 00:24:18.009
that he had made some
adjustments.

00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:20.788
Well Hadrian made some
adjustments, or Hadrian and his

00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:24.298
architects made some adjustments
as well, during Hadrian's reign.

00:24:24.298 --> 00:24:26.920
And what they did was they--two
things.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.455
They decreased the thickness,
they decreased the thickness of

00:24:31.455 --> 00:24:33.934
the walls,
from bottom to top,

00:24:33.934 --> 00:24:37.868
and they also did what Caligula
had done before,

00:24:37.868 --> 00:24:41.640
but did it even more so,
by mixing--

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.500
using as an aggregate,
at the base of the dome,

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.910
they used heavy stone,
a basalt, a very heavy,

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.298
thick basalt.
 

00:24:51.298 --> 00:24:53.670
But when they got toward the
top, they mixed,

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:55.720
or the idea was when they got
toward the top,

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.259
they would mix in as an
aggregate a porous pumice,

00:24:59.259 --> 00:25:02.116
which was much,
much lighter,

00:25:02.116 --> 00:25:07.730
and that's essentially how they
achieved their goals.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.190
Now before I talk about the
exterior of the structure,

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.700
and take you through the
building, I want to mention one

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:18.082
very interesting exchange
between Hadrian and Trajan's

00:25:18.082 --> 00:25:21.430
architect,
Apollodorus of Damascus.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:25.182
You'll remember that I said
that the Temple of Venus and

00:25:25.182 --> 00:25:28.460
Roma we think was designed by
Hadrian himself.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.636
And at one point
Hadrian--Apollodorus was still

00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:35.780
alive and highly respected--
and at one point Hadrian went

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.137
to Apollodorus to ask him for
his thoughts on the designs that

00:25:40.137 --> 00:25:43.910
Hadrian was doing for the plans,
that Hadrian was doing for the

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:46.595
Temple of Venus and Roma,
which tells us--if you wondered

00:25:46.595 --> 00:25:49.020
where I got--
how we know that Hadrian was an

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.790
amateur architect,
it's because of this passage,

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.017
because it tells us that
Hadrian was doing some designing

00:25:55.017 --> 00:25:58.358
and that he was designing the
Temple of Venus and Roma.

00:25:58.358 --> 00:26:04.048
And we fortunately have the
Roman senator of eastern birth,

00:26:04.048 --> 00:26:08.230
Dio Cassius--D-i-o,
new word, C-a-s-s-i-u-s,

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.776
Dio Cassius,
a Roman senator of eastern

00:26:10.776 --> 00:26:13.921
birth--
who wrote a history of Rome in

00:26:13.921 --> 00:26:17.978
the third century A.D.,
gives us an account of this

00:26:17.978 --> 00:26:22.068
interaction between Hadrian and
Apollodorus of Damascus.

00:26:22.068 --> 00:26:24.618
And although I don't like to
read to you,

00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:26.730
I am going to read to you from
this quote,

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.890
because it is so critical for
our understanding,

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.848
both of the Pantheon and for
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli.

00:26:33.848 --> 00:26:38.640
So bear with me as a read this,
a bit longish quote.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.011
So Cassius Dio tells us,
and I quote:

00:26:42.011 --> 00:26:45.759
"Hadrian first drove into
exile,

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:50.612
and then put to death
Apollodorus, who had carried out

00:26:50.612 --> 00:26:54.000
many of Trajan's building
projects.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.785
The pretext given for Hadrian's
action was Apollodorus had been

00:26:58.785 --> 00:27:03.114
guilty of some serious offence,
but the truth is that when

00:27:03.114 --> 00:27:06.588
Trajan was at one time
consulting with Apollodorus,

00:27:06.588 --> 00:27:08.612
about a certain problem
connected with his

00:27:08.612 --> 00:27:10.287
buildings"--
that is Trajan's

00:27:10.287 --> 00:27:12.868
buildings--"the architect
said to Hadrian--";

00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:15.948
so this seems to have been
before even Hadrian become

00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:16.538
emperor.
 

00:27:16.538 --> 00:27:20.807
"The architect said to
Hadrian, who had interrupted

00:27:20.807 --> 00:27:24.221
them with some advice,
'Go away and draw your

00:27:24.221 --> 00:27:25.230
pumpkins.
 

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.098
You know nothing about these
problems.'

00:27:28.098 --> 00:27:32.269
For it so happened that Hadrian
was at that time priding himself

00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:33.990
on some sort of drawing.
 

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.015
When he became emperor"--
that is when Hadrian became

00:27:37.015 --> 00:27:40.454
emperor--
"he remembered the insult

00:27:40.454 --> 00:27:45.910
and refused to put up with
Apollodorus' outspokenness.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:50.058
He sent him the plan for the
Temple of Venus and Roma,

00:27:50.058 --> 00:27:55.230
in order to demonstrate that it
was possible for a great work to

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:58.680
be conceived without
Apollodorus' help,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.723
and asked him"--that is,
Hadrian asked

00:28:01.723 --> 00:28:05.700
Apollodorus--"if he thought
the building was well designed.

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.116
Apollodorus sent a reply saying
that as far the Temple of Venus

00:28:10.116 --> 00:28:13.709
and Roma was concerned,
it should have been placed in a

00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:15.000
higher position."
 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.710
It should've had a high podium,
not a low podium,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.778
according to Apollodorus,
who goes on to say,

00:28:21.778 --> 00:28:23.558
"'With regard to the cult
images--

00:28:23.558 --> 00:28:26.509
'" Apollodorus goes on to
say,

00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:28.058
"'With regard to the cult
images,

00:28:28.058 --> 00:28:31.846
they were made on a scale which
was too great for the height of

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:34.382
the cella,
for if the goddesses should

00:28:34.382 --> 00:28:37.609
wish to stand up and leave the
temple,' he said,

00:28:37.609 --> 00:28:40.470
'they would be unable to do so.'
 

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.164
When he wrote all of this so
bluntly, Hadrian was both

00:28:44.164 --> 00:28:48.210
irritated and deeply pained,
he had the man slain."

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:53.009
Now the pumpkins--what's
critical about this,

00:28:53.009 --> 00:28:55.401
it tells us two things that are
absolutely essential in our

00:28:55.401 --> 00:28:57.008
understanding of Hadrianic
architecture:

00:28:57.008 --> 00:28:58.674
one,
that Hadrian was doing

00:28:58.674 --> 00:29:01.422
designing on his own,
that he was an amateur

00:29:01.422 --> 00:29:05.284
architect, and he seems to be
very much involved in the design

00:29:05.284 --> 00:29:07.500
of the Temple of Venus and Roma.
 

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.832
It also tells us that Hadrian
was making some drawings of

00:29:11.832 --> 00:29:13.069
pumpkin domes.
 

00:29:13.069 --> 00:29:14.769
What are pumpkin domes?
 

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:18.608
Well pumpkin domes are
undoubtedly segmented domes.

00:29:18.608 --> 00:29:23.541
They are just the kind of dome
that Rabirius did for the

00:29:23.541 --> 00:29:27.220
octagonal rooms in the Palatine
palace;

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:31.625
rooms that Hadrian was exposed
to by living in that palace

00:29:31.625 --> 00:29:36.494
himself, obviously fond of them,
liked them, started to draw his

00:29:36.494 --> 00:29:37.808
own pumpkins.
 

00:29:37.808 --> 00:29:40.830
And we're going to see that
those pumpkins--well we don't

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:43.905
have a pumpkin dome in the
Pantheon, as we'll see probably

00:29:43.905 --> 00:29:44.769
fortunately.
 

00:29:44.769 --> 00:29:50.009
But we do have them at
Hadrian's Villa.

00:29:50.009 --> 00:29:53.221
And so again very critical for
you to be aware of this

00:29:53.221 --> 00:29:56.373
interesting exchange,
very momentous exchange between

00:29:56.373 --> 00:29:58.068
Hadrian and Apollodorus.
 

00:29:58.068 --> 00:30:00.458
We see here the façade
of the Pantheon,

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:01.519
as it looks today.
 

00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:05.873
You have to think away this
very attractive but nonetheless

00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:08.570
mars the view,
of the façade of the

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.815
Pantheon,
that was put up in the

00:30:10.815 --> 00:30:11.798
Renaissance.
 

00:30:11.798 --> 00:30:14.307
And you have to imagine the
building now stands in

00:30:14.307 --> 00:30:16.762
isolation, without its
colonnades and without its

00:30:16.762 --> 00:30:17.480
forecourt.
 

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.630
So you have to try to imagine
them.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:23.808
But you can see how very well
preserved the Pantheon is.

00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:27.269
The ground level has shifted,
so we don't see the very tall

00:30:27.269 --> 00:30:30.509
podium that was once there,
although there have been some

00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:33.188
excavations around it,
that demonstrate that it is

00:30:33.188 --> 00:30:35.460
indeed there,
or part of it is indeed there.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.589
But we can see the columns
across the front.

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:39.660
We can see an inscription.
 

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:41.558
We can see the pediment and the
attic.

00:30:41.558 --> 00:30:44.615
And this is a good view because
although you see the dome

00:30:44.615 --> 00:30:46.690
peeping up a little bit on the
top,

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.519
it gives you some sense of when
you stood in the colonnade,

00:30:49.519 --> 00:30:51.414
walking toward it,
the forecourt,

00:30:51.414 --> 00:30:53.917
walking toward it,
that you would have only seen

00:30:53.917 --> 00:30:56.348
essentially the most traditional
part of the building,

00:30:56.348 --> 00:30:58.819
and that is the columns
supporting the pediment,

00:30:58.819 --> 00:31:01.068
with the dome behind.
 

00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:05.130
This is a detail of the
inscription of the building.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.578
We can also see the columns.
 

00:31:07.578 --> 00:31:10.828
You can see that they are grey
granite--I've a better view in a

00:31:10.828 --> 00:31:13.450
moment--grey granite with white
marble capitals.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.288
The inscription is fascinating.
 

00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:18.390
It tells us that M. AGRIPPA,
Marcus Agrippa--that's the

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.545
famous Marcus Agrippa,
the childhood friend,

00:31:21.545 --> 00:31:24.516
confidant, son-in-law,
firsthand man,

00:31:24.516 --> 00:31:28.002
one-time heir to Augustus--
Marcus Agrippa;

00:31:28.002 --> 00:31:31.240
L.F., Lucius Filius,
the son of Lucius;

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.930
COS, consul;
consul; TERTIUM,

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:37.608
for the third time;
FECIT, made it.

00:31:37.608 --> 00:31:40.827
This tells us Marcus Agrippa,
Consul for the third time,

00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:42.289
son of Lucius,
made it;

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:43.390
made the Pantheon.
 

00:31:43.390 --> 00:31:44.660
What's that all about?
 

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:47.308
Marcus Agrippa lived in the age
of Augustus.

00:31:47.308 --> 00:31:50.297
Well we know there was an
earlier Pantheon on this site,

00:31:50.297 --> 00:31:53.338
that Marcus Agrippa was
responsible for commissioning.

00:31:53.338 --> 00:31:55.112
Marcus Agrippa,
like Augustus,

00:31:55.112 --> 00:31:57.680
commissioned a lot of buildings
in Rome.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.368
He also commissioned them in
the provinces.

00:31:59.368 --> 00:32:01.650
We'll look at some of those
when we go out to the provinces.

00:32:01.650 --> 00:32:04.645
Marcus Agrippa,
a major building program in

00:32:04.645 --> 00:32:08.568
Rome, including a pantheon,
a temple to all the gods.

00:32:08.568 --> 00:32:11.420
And we don't--that pantheon no
longer exists,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.487
although there have been some
excavations that have discovered

00:32:14.487 --> 00:32:16.750
some of it underneath the
current building.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.769
But it stood on this very site,
and we know,

00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:22.490
from a literary description,
that it had a caryatid porch,

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:25.288
which is perhaps not
surprising, in the context of

00:32:25.288 --> 00:32:26.660
Augustan architecture.
 

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:29.903
You'll remember the caryatids,
in the Forum of Augustus that

00:32:29.903 --> 00:32:31.828
we looked at earlier in the
term.

00:32:31.828 --> 00:32:35.135
So we know that Marcus Agrippa
actually built Rome's first

00:32:35.135 --> 00:32:38.558
pantheon, his first temple to
the gods on this very site.

00:32:38.558 --> 00:32:41.160
When Hadrian built his own
pantheon,

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.306
on the same site,
he decided to piously reference

00:32:44.306 --> 00:32:47.058
the earlier building of Marcus
Agrippa,

00:32:47.058 --> 00:32:49.769
telling us that Marcus Agrippa
made this,

00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:51.990
made a building that originally
stood on this site,

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:56.108
which he is basically very
modestly saying he restored.

00:32:56.108 --> 00:32:59.384
Of course, this building that
he made has nothing to do

00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:01.808
undoubtedly with the Pantheon in
Rome;

00:33:01.808 --> 00:33:04.490
it's a very different and much
more sophisticated building.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:07.930
But it was a very modest thing
to do.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:12.655
But I think there was a method
to his madness in the sense that

00:33:12.655 --> 00:33:15.130
he was underscoring,
by so doing,

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.650
his relationship once again to
Augustus,

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:20.930
which was obviously very
important for him to do.

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.215
But this inscription confused a
lot of scholars for a long time,

00:33:25.215 --> 00:33:29.230
who actually called this
originally an Augustan building.

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:31.059
You can see the pediment up
above.

00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:34.182
You can see all the holes there;
those are the attachment marks

00:33:34.182 --> 00:33:37.688
for sculpture that would have
been located in this pediment

00:33:37.688 --> 00:33:39.318
that no longer survives.
 

00:33:39.318 --> 00:33:42.429
Here's another view showing the
grey, the light grey granite

00:33:42.429 --> 00:33:44.588
columns, the white Corinthian
capitals;

00:33:44.588 --> 00:33:48.670
all of these magnificently
carved, very high quality

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:51.150
architects and artisans here.
 

00:33:51.150 --> 00:33:53.285
By the way, I forgot to
mention, when we talked about

00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:55.750
the Temple of Venus and Roma and
the use of Greek marble,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.269
that Hadrian not only brought
in Greek marble,

00:33:58.269 --> 00:34:01.568
but he brought in Greek marble
cutters,

00:34:01.568 --> 00:34:04.003
marble carvers,
who were responsible for

00:34:04.003 --> 00:34:05.190
working on these.
 

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.866
So he wanted the very best,
those who were most familiar

00:34:07.866 --> 00:34:10.715
with carving Greek marble,
to be used for his buildings,

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:13.340
and they were undoubtedly used
for this one as well.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.097
And we can see the depth of the
porch, I think also,

00:34:17.097 --> 00:34:20.561
from this view of the
Corinthian columns of that

00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:21.300
porch.
 

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.059
It's very hard in a classroom
in New Haven,

00:34:24.059 --> 00:34:27.871
even with outstanding slides,
to be able to give you a sense

00:34:27.871 --> 00:34:32.465
of the experience that one has,
of the surprise that one has,

00:34:32.465 --> 00:34:36.349
as one walks through the door
of the Pantheon.

00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:38.500
We see the doors opened here.
 

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:40.170
They are bronze doors.
 

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:43.001
They are original doors,
from this extremely

00:34:43.001 --> 00:34:44.780
well-preserved structure.
 

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.782
And the reason that it is so
well preserved is because like

00:34:47.782 --> 00:34:51.559
other buildings in Rome,
it was reused in later times,

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:55.273
as a church primarily,
with a wonderful name,

00:34:55.273 --> 00:34:59.047
Santa Maria Rotonda;
Saint Mary, the rotund Mary

00:34:59.047 --> 00:35:02.811
essentially,
which is perfectly chosen for a

00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:07.692
building with a giant rotunda,
with a great cylindrical drum,

00:35:07.692 --> 00:35:09.320
that the building has.
 

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.599
We see those doors opened up
here,

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:14.550
and as one walks through this
very traditional porch,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:17.460
through the original bronze
doors, into the interior,

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:21.458
one is struck by the
extraordinary nature of the

00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:25.139
interior of the Pantheon,
which you see over here.

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:28.780
And all you're looking at here
is the uppermost part,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.739
with the dome essentially.
 

00:35:30.739 --> 00:35:35.010
And the reason is because it is
near--

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.632
even the human eye,
both eyes, can't take in the

00:35:38.632 --> 00:35:42.099
extent of this interior all in
one glance,

00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:44.840
and even if one uses the widest
of wide-angle lenses,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.550
you get a tremendous amount of
distortion,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:50.630
and you can't really take the
whole thing in at once,

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:52.599
which makes it extraordinary.
 

00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:56.360
And one has to rely instead on
this painting by Pannini,

00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.690
that shows you the grandeur
beneath the dome,

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:03.121
and that gives you a better
idea than any image I can show

00:36:03.121 --> 00:36:04.775
you,
however professional,

00:36:04.775 --> 00:36:08.518
of what the interior of the
Pantheon actually looks like.

00:36:08.518 --> 00:36:14.128
And you can see in this Pannini
painting the wonderful marble

00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:19.550
revetment, the marble floor,
the dome, with its coffers.

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:22.065
There are one,
two, three, four,

00:36:22.065 --> 00:36:26.690
five rows, yes five rows,
of twenty-eight coffers each;

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.190
140 coffers in all.
 

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.840
They were likely gilded in
antiquity.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.210
You see that there is an
oculus,

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.329
through which light streams
down onto that gilding,

00:36:36.329 --> 00:36:38.699
down onto the marble
incrustation.

00:36:38.699 --> 00:36:41.248
The marble incrustation,
by the way, extremely well

00:36:41.248 --> 00:36:41.860
preserved.
 

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:45.590
This is about our best example
of ancient Roman marble --

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.050
not all of it is ancient,
but a good portion of it is,

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.409
and it gives you a very good
sense of what some of these

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:54.768
marble buildings would have
looked like in antiquity.

00:36:54.768 --> 00:36:58.876
And I show you a detail of some
of the original marble revetment

00:36:58.876 --> 00:36:59.659
over here.
 

00:36:59.659 --> 00:37:02.719
And this is what those
Pompeians wished their walls

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:05.043
actually were:
beautiful marbles of all

00:37:05.043 --> 00:37:07.543
different colors,
brought from all different

00:37:07.543 --> 00:37:08.429
parts of the world.
 

00:37:08.429 --> 00:37:11.563
So even though Hadrian chose
Proconnesian marble for his

00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:14.155
Temple of Venus and Roma,
his Greek building,

00:37:14.155 --> 00:37:17.349
which we really need to think
of as a kind of Greek import for

00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:20.240
this more Roman building,
he is following in the

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.610
footsteps and Nero and the
Flavians,

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:26.182
and using multi-colored marble,
both for the revetment on the

00:37:26.182 --> 00:37:28.860
wall,
and the marble pavement down

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:29.409
below.
 

00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:32.469
Most of this building--again,
it's very well preserved--

00:37:32.469 --> 00:37:35.880
is the original structure:
the original columns,

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.507
the original pilasters,
still extremely well preserved

00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:40.739
in the Pantheon.
 

00:37:40.739 --> 00:37:43.730
Because it was used over time
as a church,

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:48.108
there are lots of accoutrements
that one would expect in a

00:37:48.108 --> 00:37:52.639
church: various saints and
niches and so on and so forth.

00:37:52.639 --> 00:37:56.210
So much of the sculpture is
from a later period.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:00.797
And it even has served as a
burial place for famous

00:38:00.797 --> 00:38:04.231
Italians,
not the least of which was

00:38:04.231 --> 00:38:06.728
Raphael,
the famous Renaissance painter,

00:38:06.728 --> 00:38:08.690
who you'll remember left a
graffito,

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:14.590
when he went down into the
subterranean chambers of Nero's

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.039
Domus Aurea.
 

00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:17.918
He was buried here,
and his tomb is one of the high

00:38:17.918 --> 00:38:19.610
points for most visitors to this
structure;

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:20.900
you see it here.
 

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.943
It dwarfs, to most people's
minds, the Tomb of Victor

00:38:23.943 --> 00:38:27.456
Emmanuel, whom you see over here
on the left-hand side of the

00:38:27.456 --> 00:38:28.099
screen.
 

00:38:28.099 --> 00:38:31.092
But note all of that Roman
symbolism: the eagle with

00:38:31.092 --> 00:38:34.380
outstretched wings and the
Amazonian pelta and so on,

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:37.059
all of those symbols of Roman
power,

00:38:37.059 --> 00:38:42.610
still very much used by
dynasts, modern dynasts,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.079
like Victor Emmanuel.
 

00:38:45.079 --> 00:38:49.485
The dome of the Pantheon had
the largest diameter of any

00:38:49.485 --> 00:38:51.489
dome, up to this point.
 

00:38:51.489 --> 00:38:56.652
We know that it was--the
diameter of the Pantheon is 142

00:38:56.652 --> 00:38:57.309
feet.
 

00:38:57.309 --> 00:39:02.036
And if we compare it to the
other large dome in Rome,

00:39:02.036 --> 00:39:03.036
that of St.
 

00:39:03.036 --> 00:39:07.943
Peter's, we find that the
Pantheon dome still surpasses

00:39:07.943 --> 00:39:08.217
St.
 

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:09.489
Peter's.
 

00:39:09.489 --> 00:39:09.750
St.
 

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.619
Peter's is 139 feet in
diameter;

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:14.599
so just a bit smaller.
 

00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:17.222
Now any of you who have been
both in the Pantheon and in St.

00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:19.755
Peter's will probably say to
me: "Wait a minute here,

00:39:19.755 --> 00:39:20.422
the dome of St.
 

00:39:20.422 --> 00:39:22.867
Peter's actually looks larger,
when you stand underneath

00:39:22.867 --> 00:39:23.579
it."
 

00:39:23.579 --> 00:39:25.900
And I show you a view of that
dome here.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.277
The reason it does look a bit
larger is the dome of St.

00:39:29.277 --> 00:39:30.530
Peter's is taller.
 

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:34.085
So volumetrically it looks
bigger, and visually it looks

00:39:34.085 --> 00:39:37.190
bigger, but it isn't in terms of
its diameter.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:41.757
In diameter the dome of the
Pantheon is still the largest

00:39:41.757 --> 00:39:43.960
dome in the city of Rome.
 

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.717
And as you look at this dome,
and compare it to St.

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.530
Peter's, one can't help but
think--and think back to

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:52.896
Domitian and his dominus et
deus, and his vaults and so

00:39:52.896 --> 00:39:56.018
on and so forth;
the whole idea being having the

00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:57.989
dome of heaven over one's head.
 

00:39:57.989 --> 00:40:02.360
I think one can't help but
think, when one looks at this,

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.500
that there may be some
reference here,

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.579
both to the orb of the earth
and to the dome of heaven.

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:12.684
And it is certainly an
appropriate symbol for a

00:40:12.684 --> 00:40:16.679
building that honors all the
gods.

00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:20.409
I think it's important to,
at this juncture,

00:40:20.409 --> 00:40:22.710
to say something about,
or to compare,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:26.340
the most important Greek
temple, the Parthenon,

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:30.083
on the Acropolis in Athens,
with the most significant Roman

00:40:30.083 --> 00:40:31.672
temple,
the Pantheon,

00:40:31.672 --> 00:40:36.166
to see that we have really come
from an exterior to an interior

00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:38.503
architecture,
that in the case of the

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:41.202
Parthenon, fifth century B.C.,
Athenian Acropolis,

00:40:41.202 --> 00:40:44.876
they are thinking primarily of
a building that interacts with

00:40:44.876 --> 00:40:48.489
the rock of the Acropolis and
with the urban landscape,

00:40:48.489 --> 00:40:52.914
and in other contexts these
Greek buildings interact

00:40:52.914 --> 00:40:54.909
directly with nature.
 

00:40:54.909 --> 00:40:57.782
That's the way the Greeks
thought about their buildings,

00:40:57.782 --> 00:40:59.820
essentially as an exterior
structure.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.572
And we see the Romans following
suit in their emphasis on

00:41:02.572 --> 00:41:05.130
façade,
the façade of temples in

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:07.018
their own religious
architecture.

00:41:07.018 --> 00:41:09.070
But with the Pantheon,
that changes.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:13.092
Yes, it does have a pediment in
the front, it does have a

00:41:13.092 --> 00:41:14.530
traditional porch.
 

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:19.099
So that's a nod to traditional
temple architecture.

00:41:19.099 --> 00:41:20.969
But once you go through that
porch,

00:41:20.969 --> 00:41:25.208
into the structure,
and see that great cylindrical

00:41:25.208 --> 00:41:27.188
drum,
the hemispherical dome,

00:41:27.188 --> 00:41:30.873
the light streaming through,
you're in this totally new

00:41:30.873 --> 00:41:34.726
interior world that has no
precedent in early Roman

00:41:34.726 --> 00:41:35.960
architecture.
 

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:39.349
And that had a huge impact on
later Byzantine architecture,

00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:42.039
Medieval--especially Byzantine
architecture.

00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:44.923
And particularly go to Istanbul
and see Hagia Sophia,

00:41:44.923 --> 00:41:48.279
or the Blue Mosque;
they owe everything to the dome

00:41:48.279 --> 00:41:49.480
of the Pantheon.
 

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.010
So we see this final,
this real transition here;

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.891
a transition also in building
materials, from stone to

00:41:55.891 --> 00:41:57.650
concrete construction.
 

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:02.929
A few more views of this,
of the interior of the dome of

00:42:02.929 --> 00:42:04.369
the Pantheon.
 

00:42:04.369 --> 00:42:06.940
These are very dramatic in
black and white,

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.300
and you can see it's just--if
you're in Rome and have the

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.481
time,
it's a great deal of fun to go

00:42:12.481 --> 00:42:15.489
and look at the Pantheon at
different times of day,

00:42:15.489 --> 00:42:18.702
because the light has such an
impact on what the interior

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:19.449
looks like.
 

00:42:19.449 --> 00:42:21.800
And you go in there in the
morning, take a look;

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.150
then go out,
have a long lunch,

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.925
a glass of wine;
come back later and see what

00:42:25.925 --> 00:42:26.909
has happened.
 

00:42:26.909 --> 00:42:29.070
And it's also fun to be there
when it rains;

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.980
it's interesting to just have
the rain come down and collect.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.186
There is a drain,
but it doesn't always work all

00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:35.750
that well.
 

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.675
So see water collecting on the
edges of the floor,

00:42:39.675 --> 00:42:42.320
in this extraordinary building.
 

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.639
One last view.
 

00:42:44.639 --> 00:42:48.115
I love taking views of the--I
have zillions of images that

00:42:48.115 --> 00:42:50.715
I've taken,
including this one of the

00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:54.449
interior of the Pantheon,
at all different times of day.

00:42:54.449 --> 00:42:58.248
But I think it behooves us to
notice and to say that in this

00:42:58.248 --> 00:43:00.630
kind of new interior
architecture,

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:02.989
this architecture of interior
surprise,

00:43:02.989 --> 00:43:06.666
it's not only the vault itself,
it's not only the concrete

00:43:06.666 --> 00:43:09.717
construction,
or the marble revetment,

00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:12.659
light plays a very important
role.

00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:16.869
We've seen light playing a very
important role from the times of

00:43:16.869 --> 00:43:20.998
the Domus Italica,
and the Sanctuary at Terracina,

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:23.887
for example,
up to where we are today,

00:43:23.887 --> 00:43:26.579
but never more important than
here;

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:28.760
light that streams through the
oculus,

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.050
light that is used not only to
illuminate this building,

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:35.019
and illuminate it extremely
well, but also to create drama,

00:43:35.019 --> 00:43:36.320
to create drama.
 

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.230
And you have to imagine it even
more dramatic when the coffers

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:46.059
were gilded and when the marble
down below may have been even

00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:47.590
brighter still.
 

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.184
The marble pavement,
by the way, which I didn't show

00:43:50.184 --> 00:43:52.219
you, is also extremely well
preserved.

00:43:52.219 --> 00:43:56.248
So this light plays a very
important and dramatic role in

00:43:56.248 --> 00:43:59.920
this new, highly developed
interior architecture.

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.193
And I personally know of no
other building that one can

00:44:04.193 --> 00:44:09.179
visit and experience that gives
you a better sense than this one

00:44:09.179 --> 00:44:12.030
of the divine presence on earth.
 

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.054
Whether it's one god,
multi gods, as were honored

00:44:15.054 --> 00:44:17.237
here,
you really get a sense of

00:44:17.237 --> 00:44:21.199
spirituality when you stand in
this extraordinary temple,

00:44:21.199 --> 00:44:24.300
and really do get a sense of
the divine presence,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.559
I think, on earth.
 

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:29.739
I mentioned that the Pantheon
has spawned--

00:44:29.739 --> 00:44:34.239
lots of buildings have been
cloned from the Pantheon,

00:44:34.239 --> 00:44:37.309
both in ancient times--and I'll
show you a couple of examples

00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:40.121
later in the semester--
but also in more modern times

00:44:40.121 --> 00:44:41.599
there are lots of examples.
 

00:44:41.599 --> 00:44:43.045
Woolsey Hall,
for example,

00:44:43.045 --> 00:44:45.420
here on campus is a kind of a
pantheon.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:50.489
But look at--the most obvious
example,

00:44:50.489 --> 00:44:54.110
in the United States,
is not only Monticello,

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.260
but also Thomas Jefferson's
University of Virginia,

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:59.869
the Rotunda at the University
of Virginia,

00:44:59.869 --> 00:45:03.969
which you see here is clearly
based exactly on the Pantheon.

00:45:03.969 --> 00:45:06.764
Thomas Jefferson,
a great fan of ancient

00:45:06.764 --> 00:45:07.840
architecture.
 

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:09.657
His library,
his personal library,

00:45:09.657 --> 00:45:11.969
has lots of books on Roman
architecture.

00:45:11.969 --> 00:45:15.226
When you look at a view of the
Rotunda and the Lawn at the

00:45:15.226 --> 00:45:18.311
University of Virginia--I
taught, my first teaching job

00:45:18.311 --> 00:45:20.239
was at UVA;
I taught there for three years.

00:45:20.239 --> 00:45:24.059
But when you look at this
building,

00:45:24.059 --> 00:45:26.626
the Lawn at UVA,
with the Rotunda,

00:45:26.626 --> 00:45:30.981
you can't help but wonder if
Thomas Jefferson didn't know

00:45:30.981 --> 00:45:34.869
that the Pantheon in Rome had
that forecourt,

00:45:34.869 --> 00:45:38.829
because--the Rotunda faces the
wrong way,

00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:39.750
it faces this way.
 

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:42.389
But nonetheless he's got behind
it,

00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:45.918
in his own design,
this extraordinary rectangular

00:45:45.918 --> 00:45:48.367
court,
that does conjure up exactly

00:45:48.367 --> 00:45:50.860
what the Pantheon looked like in
Rome.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.579
A few very quick views of the
Pantheon.

00:45:54.579 --> 00:45:57.163
I just hate to let it go,
but some quick views of the

00:45:57.163 --> 00:45:57.710
Pantheon.
 

00:45:57.710 --> 00:46:01.818
One of the best ways of seeing
it, it's surrounded by not only

00:46:01.818 --> 00:46:04.876
a wonderful piazza,
which is a great place to eat

00:46:04.876 --> 00:46:08.168
gelato or have a glass of wine,
but there are--you can

00:46:08.168 --> 00:46:11.369
encounter it from a number of
narrow streets,

00:46:11.369 --> 00:46:13.579
and that whole element of
surprise is still there.

00:46:13.579 --> 00:46:16.510
You're walking along the street
and wow, all of a sudden,

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.079
there it is in front of you.
 

00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:21.061
And you can see that very well
here, as you begin to get a

00:46:21.061 --> 00:46:21.900
glimpse of it.
 

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.780
With regard to eating around
the Pantheon,

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:29.018
I recommend one of my absolute
favorite restaurants in Rome,

00:46:29.018 --> 00:46:31.315
which is easy to remember
because it's Fortunato al

00:46:31.315 --> 00:46:34.838
Pantheon;
you see it over here with its

00:46:34.838 --> 00:46:39.940
wonderful outdoor space and its
white umbrellas.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.349
Right across from the Pantheon,
directly across,

00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:46.039
is a McDonald's.
 

00:46:46.039 --> 00:46:49.108
The golden arches are really
very much like a Roman aqueduct,

00:46:49.108 --> 00:46:50.030
don't you think?
 

00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:52.094
So references--I told you there
are resonances everywhere of

00:46:52.094 --> 00:46:52.340
Rome.
 

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:55.349
Don't eat--you can eat at
McDonald's anytime;

00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:58.699
go to the other one,
much more interesting.

00:46:58.699 --> 00:47:01.610
And it has the best--I've never
had this anywhere else--

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:04.800
it has a veal scaloppine al
gorgonzola,

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.235
with gorgonzola,
a very thin layer of

00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:08.860
gorgonzola: delicious.
 

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:13.869
I also told you I was going to
keep you abreast of the latest

00:47:13.869 --> 00:47:15.539
on gelato in Rome.
 

00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:18.583
We've talked about Tre Scalini;
so I just wanted to show you

00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:19.449
Della Panna .
 

00:47:19.449 --> 00:47:22.521
If you're standing at the
Pantheon restaurant,

00:47:22.521 --> 00:47:25.456
look to the right,
you're going to see Della

00:47:25.456 --> 00:47:26.889
Palma, P-a-l-m-a.
 

00:47:26.889 --> 00:47:30.282
Of the four best,
actually I think it's the

00:47:30.282 --> 00:47:31.010
fourth.
 

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:33.494
It's not my absolute favorite,
but if you like--it's a little

00:47:33.494 --> 00:47:35.400
bit more Americanized,
as you can see from this

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:35.980
selection.
 

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:39.083
Notice there are Mars bars,
specialità,

00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:41.530
as well as some of their other
flavors.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:42.980
My favorite,
personal favorite,

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.300
is zabaglione,
which you see over here.

00:47:45.300 --> 00:47:47.869
But just to whet your appetite
early in the morning.

00:47:47.869 --> 00:47:51.710
I want to move,
in the twenty minutes or so

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:57.016
that remain, I would like to
move from the Pantheon in Rome

00:47:57.016 --> 00:48:01.257
to Hadrian's home;
not his home in Rome,

00:48:01.257 --> 00:48:07.304
which as we've mentioned was
the Palace of Domitian on the

00:48:07.304 --> 00:48:11.760
Palatine Hill,
but his Villa at Tivoli.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:16.318
Tivoli, ancient Tibur;
we've talked about Tivoli many

00:48:16.318 --> 00:48:17.597
times before,
where the marble,

00:48:17.597 --> 00:48:19.260
the travertine quarries are
located.

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:22.599
Tivoli is about a,
well I don't know,

00:48:22.599 --> 00:48:25.590
forty minute drive from Rome
today,

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.300
kind of a high speed drive from
Rome today,

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:31.199
but in antiquity longer,
obviously,

00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:33.800
but not inaccessible from Rome.
 

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.139
Hadrian obviously had no
problems getting there in

00:48:37.139 --> 00:48:38.639
ancient Roman times.
 

00:48:38.639 --> 00:48:43.010
It's an extraordinary place,
and Hadrian--

00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:44.987
it was a place that Hadrian
used as a kind of incubator for

00:48:44.987 --> 00:48:47.675
his architectural ideas,
and it's highly likely that

00:48:47.675 --> 00:48:51.599
many of the buildings that we
see there were designed in part

00:48:51.599 --> 00:48:54.362
by him,
especially those famous pumpkin

00:48:54.362 --> 00:48:56.552
domes,
because we're going to see that

00:48:56.552 --> 00:48:59.505
a number of these buildings do
indeed have pumpkin domes

00:48:59.505 --> 00:49:02.940
designed under the influence of
the architecture of Rabirius.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.239
It's an amazing villa.
 

00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:07.844
It is the most extensive villa
preserved, from the Roman world,

00:49:07.844 --> 00:49:10.869
and likely the most grand of
all the Roman villas.

00:49:10.869 --> 00:49:13.952
And if we think back to Nero's
Palace in Rome,

00:49:13.952 --> 00:49:18.202
what made Nero's Palace in Rome
so scandalous was the fact that

00:49:18.202 --> 00:49:20.670
it was located in downtown Rome.
 

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:26.063
But if you compare Nero's
Palace to Hadrian's Villa at

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:30.949
Tivoli, there's no comparison
between the two.

00:49:30.949 --> 00:49:33.699
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli is
much more extensive.

00:49:33.699 --> 00:49:36.960
It has much more extraordinary
buildings,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.458
from the architectural
standpoint, and it was decorated

00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:43.492
even more opulently,
with a wide variety of

00:49:43.492 --> 00:49:45.880
sculpture, mosaics and
paintings.

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:48.409
It was clearly an extraordinary
place.

00:49:48.409 --> 00:49:53.068
And if Trajan's Forum was in a
sense a microcosm of the extent

00:49:53.068 --> 00:49:57.840
of the Empire under Trajan,
I like to think of Hadrian's

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.030
Villa as the Empire under
Hadrian,

00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.469
the Empire that he traveled
around so many times.

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:07.590
And I show you in the upper
right a map of the Roman Empire.

00:50:07.590 --> 00:50:11.855
All of that orange area is the
area that was under Rome's aegis

00:50:11.855 --> 00:50:15.570
at the time of Trajan and into
the years of Hadrian.

00:50:15.570 --> 00:50:18.103
And if you look closely,
you will see three colored

00:50:18.103 --> 00:50:21.139
lines;
a yellow, a blue and a red line.

00:50:21.139 --> 00:50:23.920
Those are Hadrian's travels
around the Empire,

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.579
and it shows you how extensive
they were.

00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:27.650
He went everywhere.
 

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:28.510
Why?
 

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:31.280
Because he loved to travel,
he just loved to travel.

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.746
But he also went in order to
take a look at provincial

00:50:35.746 --> 00:50:37.768
affairs at first hand.
 

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:41.309
Now everywhere he went,
he either--he himself paid for

00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:45.726
buildings that were erected,
or, more often than that,

00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:50.889
buildings were put up by local
magistrates and so on,

00:50:50.889 --> 00:50:53.411
local cities,
in honor of Hadrian,

00:50:53.411 --> 00:50:56.849
in order to try to get a favor
out of him,

00:50:56.849 --> 00:50:59.518
or just to honor him on his
visits.

00:50:59.518 --> 00:51:02.880
Some of these were rushed,
put up in a rush job in order

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.510
to be there when he arrived on
the scene.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:10.365
So we see this incredible array
of building activity during this

00:51:10.365 --> 00:51:11.059
period.
 

00:51:11.059 --> 00:51:14.226
And we will see that reflected
as we make our way,

00:51:14.226 --> 00:51:17.393
beginning already next week,
make our way into the

00:51:17.393 --> 00:51:18.300
provinces.
 

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:23.106
We will begin to see some very
interesting Hadrianic buildings

00:51:23.106 --> 00:51:27.757
in those provinces that reflect
what he was doing elsewhere,

00:51:27.757 --> 00:51:28.940
or in Rome.
 

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.849
But what we see here,
what we see at the villa is

00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:32.699
fascinating.
 

00:51:32.699 --> 00:51:34.250
Because all of us,
we're just back from break;

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:35.268
some of you did some traveling.
 

00:51:35.268 --> 00:51:38.320
We know that traveling expands
all of our horizons.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.268
We go someplace;
experientially we're different

00:51:41.268 --> 00:51:43.692
than we were before,
by what we see and what we

00:51:43.692 --> 00:51:44.429
experience.
 

00:51:44.429 --> 00:51:47.327
And we also--maybe not in this
new economic climate,

00:51:47.327 --> 00:51:50.114
but at least in the past,
we all tended to pick up

00:51:50.114 --> 00:51:51.923
souvenirs;
a T-shirt here,

00:51:51.923 --> 00:51:55.342
and a whatever there,
a handbag there,

00:51:55.342 --> 00:51:59.409
and we bring those back,
to remind us,

00:51:59.409 --> 00:52:04.369
and make us have memories of
the wonderful trip that we took.

00:52:04.369 --> 00:52:05.719
Well Hadrian did that as well.
 

00:52:05.719 --> 00:52:07.268
He collected souvenirs.
 

00:52:07.268 --> 00:52:10.773
But because of his own wealth,
and because he had the imperial

00:52:10.773 --> 00:52:13.474
treasury behind him,
he could collect buildings,

00:52:13.474 --> 00:52:15.139
as souvenirs essentially.
 

00:52:15.139 --> 00:52:18.489
So when Hadrian traveled and
saw what he liked,

00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:22.070
what he did was he came back to
this laboratory,

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:26.110
this architectural laboratory
that he had at Tivoli,

00:52:26.110 --> 00:52:29.563
and he either created--some of
these were probably designed by

00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:31.708
him,
others by his architects--he

00:52:31.708 --> 00:52:35.393
created a series of buildings
that were in a sense souvenirs

00:52:35.393 --> 00:52:38.771
of his travels,
either exact duplicates of

00:52:38.771 --> 00:52:42.989
things he saw,
or variations on those themes.

00:52:42.989 --> 00:52:46.173
And it makes these buildings
particularly fascinating to look

00:52:46.173 --> 00:52:46.440
at.
 

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.916
The Villa of Hadrian had
essentially three building

00:52:50.916 --> 00:52:54.500
phases: an early,
a middle and a late.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:53:00.940
They spanned the entire reign
of Hadrian.

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.340
This villa was clearly
Hadrian's hobby,

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:06.434
as well as his home,
and if he hadn't died in 138,

00:53:06.434 --> 00:53:09.719
he would've undoubtedly
continued to build here.

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:12.730
So these buildings go up
throughout the course of

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.860
Hadrian's reign.
 

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:17.539
I show you a view from the air
of the villa as it looks today.

00:53:17.539 --> 00:53:21.288
You can see that there are a
series of very attractive pools

00:53:21.288 --> 00:53:24.018
of water, interspersed with
architecture.

00:53:24.018 --> 00:53:27.460
If we look at a plan of the
villa,

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:30.411
you will see that it is
different than any other villa

00:53:30.411 --> 00:53:33.809
we've seen before in that these
buildings are actually kind of

00:53:33.809 --> 00:53:36.365
casually,
almost in an ad hoc way,

00:53:36.365 --> 00:53:39.429
arranged around nature,
to interact with nature.

00:53:39.429 --> 00:53:42.467
We don't see the axiality and
the symmetry that is so

00:53:42.467 --> 00:53:45.389
characteristic of so much of
Roman architecture.

00:53:45.389 --> 00:53:48.527
They kind of meander along,
as you might expect

00:53:48.527 --> 00:53:51.190
architectural experiments to
meander.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:54.106
And it has everything there;
not only pools but a wide

00:53:54.106 --> 00:53:56.981
variety of buildings that I'm
going to show you fairly

00:53:56.981 --> 00:53:59.639
fleetingly: this great island
villa over here;

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:03.320
the Piazza d'Oro or the Golden
Plaza;

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:08.199
the two sets of baths,
a large bath and a small bath.

00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:10.237
You also see a stadium here,
hairpin shaped,

00:54:10.237 --> 00:54:11.849
that I'm not going to return
to.

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:13.780
The Canopus: another pool.
 

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:17.074
This was so complete that it
even had its own Hades,

00:54:17.074 --> 00:54:18.949
its own Hell,
in the villa.

00:54:18.949 --> 00:54:19.960
Everything was here.
 

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.969
Hadrian left no stone unturned.
 

00:54:22.969 --> 00:54:25.000
I want to show you,
in fairly quick succession,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.730
examples of the most
interesting buildings,

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:32.090
of these tourist souvenirs,
that Hadrian brings back from

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:33.179
his travels.
 

00:54:33.179 --> 00:54:37.744
The first I'd like to show you
is the so-called Temple of

00:54:37.744 --> 00:54:42.226
Venus, which belongs to the
latest building phase at the

00:54:42.226 --> 00:54:44.018
villa: 133 to 138.
 

00:54:44.018 --> 00:54:46.594
This is Hadrian the
philhellene, once again,

00:54:46.594 --> 00:54:49.768
just as we saw him at the
Temple of Venus and Roma.

00:54:49.768 --> 00:54:51.860
He goes to the Greek island of
Knidos,

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.840
K-n-i-d-o-s,
the Greek island of Knidos,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.989
on which there was the most
famous round Temple of Venus,

00:54:58.989 --> 00:55:01.869
with the most famous Greek
statue of Venus,

00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:05.800
a statue by the great Greek
sculptor Praxiteles.

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:10.652
Lots of people went to see it,
and interestingly enough it was

00:55:10.652 --> 00:55:15.221
this temple and the statue,
excavated a number of decades

00:55:15.221 --> 00:55:18.257
ago by a woman,
a female archaeologist with the

00:55:18.257 --> 00:55:20.990
perfect name,
Iris Love, for the goddess of

00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:23.811
love --
and that was really her name,

00:55:23.811 --> 00:55:28.496
destined to go excavate the
Temple of the Goddess of Love on

00:55:28.496 --> 00:55:30.880
the Greek island of Knidos.
 

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:32.139
Hadrian goes there.
 

00:55:32.139 --> 00:55:33.969
He's enraptured by what he sees.
 

00:55:33.969 --> 00:55:39.217
He builds at his villa an exact
replica, an exact replica of

00:55:39.217 --> 00:55:41.530
this Greek round temple.
 

00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:45.010
You can see it's the Doric
order.

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:47.168
You can see it supports
triglyphs and metopes,

00:55:47.168 --> 00:55:49.949
and then in the center a statue
of Venus, unfortunately now

00:55:49.949 --> 00:55:51.150
headless and armless.
 

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:53.579
That's a cast.
 

00:55:53.579 --> 00:55:56.150
The original is in the museum
on the site.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:56:00.811
You see it in the museum on the
site, over here,

00:56:00.811 --> 00:56:04.579
based on Praxiteles' earlier
statue.

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:07.849
There are lots of copies of
this famous Praxitelean statue.

00:56:07.849 --> 00:56:11.210
We see another one here in the
Vatican, that's more complete,

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.010
gives you a better sense of
what it looked like.

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:15.784
But again, here are the Doric
columns and the triglyphs and

00:56:15.784 --> 00:56:16.090
metopes.
 

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:19.121
So the most important point for
you, an exact replica,

00:56:19.121 --> 00:56:20.610
in this particular case.
 

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:26.179
The most extraordinary of these
sort of architectural conceits,

00:56:26.179 --> 00:56:30.331
these giant tourist souvenirs
that Hadrian brings back from

00:56:30.331 --> 00:56:34.481
his travels to his villa at
Tivoli is the so-called Canopus

00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:37.443
at Hadrian's Villa,
my personal favorite,

00:56:37.443 --> 00:56:39.460
the Canopus,
at Hadrian's Villa,

00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:41.099
which you see on your Monument
List,

00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:48.030
also dating to the latest
period, 133 to 138 A.D.

00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:50.960
It is meant to conjure up,
in this case,

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.117
not Greece but Egypt:
a canal, the Canopus,

00:56:54.117 --> 00:56:57.650
in Egypt, that was a tributary
of the Nile.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:02.072
And we know that you could
travel from Alexandria to a

00:57:02.072 --> 00:57:06.329
small town called Canopus by
means of this canal.

00:57:06.329 --> 00:57:08.590
And that is what is meant to be
conjured up here.

00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:14.619
The city of Canopus had in it a
temple to the Egyptian god,

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:18.902
Serapis, S-e-r-a-p-i-s,
Serapis, who was the healing

00:57:18.902 --> 00:57:21.597
god,
and people came from all around

00:57:21.597 --> 00:57:24.929
the world to be healed at the
Temple of Serapis.

00:57:24.929 --> 00:57:29.217
It was also well known as a
place with a wonderful amusement

00:57:29.217 --> 00:57:31.380
park,
and we think that although

00:57:31.380 --> 00:57:33.510
Hadrian seems to have gone
there,

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:37.099
in part, to go to the Sanctuary
of Serapis,

00:57:37.099 --> 00:57:40.929
he also appears to have gone
there because it was also an

00:57:40.929 --> 00:57:43.813
amusement park,
and this is where we get into

00:57:43.813 --> 00:57:46.039
the personal love triangle of
Hadrian.

00:57:46.039 --> 00:57:50.289
Hadrian was married to a woman
by the name of Sabina;

00:57:50.289 --> 00:57:54.043
a very beautiful woman,
but she does look kind of dour

00:57:54.043 --> 00:57:58.010
in this portrait on the right
hand side of the screen.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.172
So perhaps we don't blame him
for taking up with what must

00:58:00.172 --> 00:58:02.300
have been the most beautiful boy
in all of antiquity,

00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:07.619
a youth by the name of
Antinous, A-n-t-i-n-o-u-s,

00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:14.010
Antinous, whom Hadrian met on
his travels in Asia Minor,

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.016
smitten with the boy,
and they became constant

00:58:17.016 --> 00:58:18.619
companions thereafter.
 

00:58:18.619 --> 00:58:23.119
But unfortunately Antinous,
while still very young,

00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:26.809
died by drowning,
where else but the Nile,

00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:30.050
in Egypt, also on these
travels.

00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:32.697
They went to Canopus together,
by the way, to the amusement

00:58:32.697 --> 00:58:35.210
park, but poor Antinous died by
drowning in the Nile.

00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:37.110
No one knows exactly what
happened.

00:58:37.110 --> 00:58:38.349
Was it an accident?
 

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:41.820
Some say that he may have given
his life to save Hadrian's.

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.070
We don't really know.
 

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:47.460
That's never been sorted out as
to exactly what happened to this

00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:49.969
wonderful and beautiful young
man.

00:58:49.969 --> 00:58:53.943
But he died by drowning in the
Nile, which made the Nile a

00:58:53.943 --> 00:58:57.989
particularly poignant spot for
Hadrian, who appears to have

00:58:57.989 --> 00:59:00.429
recreated it here at his villa.
 

00:59:00.429 --> 00:59:03.746
He also went on to found--this
is one of the reasons this has

00:59:03.746 --> 00:59:06.900
inspired so many design-your-own
Roman cities projects;

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:09.210
not only the relationship
between Hadrian and Antinous,

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.650
and this love triangle with
Sabina,

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.358
but also because Hadrian went
around the Empire and founded

00:59:15.358 --> 00:59:18.983
one Antinoopolis after another;
there were tons of

00:59:18.983 --> 00:59:21.760
Antinoopolises all around Rome .
 

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.606
And he put up statues of
Antinous in every possible

00:59:24.606 --> 00:59:26.483
guise,
of every possible god:

00:59:26.483 --> 00:59:28.900
the major Roman gods and some
of the--

00:59:28.900 --> 00:59:32.500
and all the minor Roman gods as
well.

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:34.489
And there are lots of statues
of Antinous.

00:59:34.489 --> 00:59:36.677
This is another one that was
found at the villa,

00:59:36.677 --> 00:59:38.771
not at this pool,
although it might have been,

00:59:38.771 --> 00:59:40.679
given that the inspiration was
Egypt.

00:59:40.679 --> 00:59:44.047
This shows him in Egyptian
guise with the Egyptian

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:47.623
headdress and covering all that
wonderful curly hair,

00:59:47.623 --> 00:59:50.030
for which he was so well known.
 

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:53.070
But nonetheless,
Antinous as a pharaoh,

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:54.909
from Hadrian's Villa.
 

00:59:54.909 --> 00:59:57.110
Back to the Canopus,
you see the pool.

00:59:57.110 --> 00:59:59.440
You see it has columns on one
side.

00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.900
These columns had sculpture
interspersed.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.251
And here Greece comes back to
the fore, because many of these

01:00:06.251 --> 01:00:09.550
statues here were also based on
ancient Greek prototypes.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.925
So we see this interesting
eclecticism here:

01:00:13.925 --> 01:00:17.858
a pool based on Egypt,
with some Egyptianizing

01:00:17.858 --> 01:00:21.059
statuary, but also interspersed
with Greek statues,

01:00:21.059 --> 01:00:22.820
based on famous Greek
prototypes.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:25.284
Most important to us,
from the architectural

01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:28.438
standpoint, the straight lintel
and the arcuated lintel,

01:00:28.438 --> 01:00:30.159
used here for the Canopus.
 

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:32.550
We saw that in Second Style
Roman wall painting.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.429
We're beginning to see it now
in built architecture.

01:00:35.429 --> 01:00:38.003
It becomes a particular
favorite of Hadrian's,

01:00:38.003 --> 01:00:40.690
and we're going to see it
elsewhere in the Roman

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.349
provinces, under Hadrian.
 

01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:45.478
The influence again of Egypt,
and also in this case also of

01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:48.929
Rome: two river gods that seem
to have decorated the Canopus,

01:00:48.929 --> 01:00:52.670
this one leaning on a figure of
a sphinx,

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:56.010
so this is clearly the Nile
River.

01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.998
This one leaning on the
she-wolf, suckling Romulus and

01:00:58.998 --> 01:01:00.590
Remus;
clearly the Tiber.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.123
So once again,
very eclectic sculptural

01:01:03.123 --> 01:01:03.789
program.
 

01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:08.817
The caryatids were there too,
lining one side of the pool of

01:01:08.817 --> 01:01:10.010
the Canopus.
 

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.018
You see them over here,
now in the museum -- extremely

01:01:13.018 --> 01:01:15.400
well preserved,
based on the original fifth

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.309
century B.C.
 

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:18.110
caryatids on the Acropolis.
 

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:21.539
So Hadrian's philhellenism
coming to the fore again.

01:01:21.539 --> 01:01:23.994
You'll remember,
Augustus copied these same

01:01:23.994 --> 01:01:26.389
caryatids for his forum,
reduced scale.

01:01:26.389 --> 01:01:28.860
Hadrian's are in full length,
full scale,

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.179
same scale, as those in Greece,
and the major difference

01:01:32.179 --> 01:01:34.702
between Hadrian's caryatids,
and Augustus',

01:01:34.702 --> 01:01:36.289
Augustus', like the
Erechtheion,

01:01:36.289 --> 01:01:38.639
with the original Porch of the
Maidens,

01:01:38.639 --> 01:01:40.840
is in a public building.
 

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.442
In the case of Hadrian,
a private villa -- using these

01:01:44.442 --> 01:01:46.550
caryatids at a private villa.
 

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:49.699
Here you see them lining one
side of the Canopus,

01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:52.414
flanked on either side by
satyrs, the same kinds of

01:01:52.414 --> 01:01:55.239
fellows we saw in the Dionysiac
mystery paintings.

01:01:55.239 --> 01:01:57.380
And then, just so that we don't
forget Egypt,

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:01.539
this wonderful representation
of a statue of a crocodile that

01:02:01.539 --> 01:02:04.800
was surely placed in the center
of the pool,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.081
peeping out of the water,
just so that we make sure we

01:02:08.081 --> 01:02:09.630
remember it's the Nile.
 

01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:13.275
And I can trace my whole
professional career sitting on

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:16.179
this crocodile because every
time I'm there,

01:02:16.179 --> 01:02:19.489
including even now,
I pose on that crocodile.

01:02:19.489 --> 01:02:21.719
But I do it in part because I
think it's fun,

01:02:21.719 --> 01:02:26.083
but also to encourage--there
are two pictures that I really

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:30.070
like students to send me when
they travel to Italy.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:33.005
One is of them sitting on the
crocodile at Hadrian's Villa,

01:02:33.005 --> 01:02:35.840
and another is them on the
stepping stones at Pompeii.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.010
So I hope if you do go,
that you will do that.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:41.898
My favorite one--and I can't
find it unfortunately,

01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:43.635
because this was
pre-digital--was a student who

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.449
sent me himself on this,
with his shades on.

01:02:45.449 --> 01:02:49.244
But then he had put a cigarette
in the mouth of the crocodile,

01:02:49.244 --> 01:02:52.230
unlit cigarette--it was really
a cool picture;

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.809
I've got to find that some day.
 

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:58.639
The plan of the Canopus,
over here, shows us what we've

01:02:58.639 --> 01:03:03.199
looked at: the straight and
arcuated lintel here;

01:03:03.199 --> 01:03:07.159
the crocodile on this side;
the caryatids on that side;

01:03:07.159 --> 01:03:11.831
and then over here,
at the end, the Temple of

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:15.065
Serapis,
because they were trying to

01:03:15.065 --> 01:03:19.960
recreate again this canal that
led from Alexandria to Canopus,

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.530
and at the end of course,
the Temple of Serapis,

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:25.199
the healing god,
that was located at Canopus.

01:03:25.199 --> 01:03:29.215
But you can see as well as I,
by looking at the plan,

01:03:29.215 --> 01:03:33.465
this curved structure over
here, which we'll see is made

01:03:33.465 --> 01:03:35.010
out of concrete.
 

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.413
But this is no Egyptian
building, this is a very modern

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:39.592
Roman-looking building,
and I show it to you here,

01:03:39.592 --> 01:03:40.840
on the end of the canal.
 

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:44.351
This is called the so-called
Serapeum, or the Temple of

01:03:44.351 --> 01:03:48.579
Serapis, and you can see it has
one of Hadrian's pumpkin domes.

01:03:48.579 --> 01:03:51.666
It is very likely that it was
designed by him,

01:03:51.666 --> 01:03:55.030
by Hadrian, and we see it made
out of concrete.

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:56.440
We can see it has niches.
 

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:59.190
It actually served as a
fountain, with very deep niches,

01:03:59.190 --> 01:04:01.940
from which there would have
emanated a water display.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:05.010
And then you can see a concrete
dome,

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:09.190
up above, with those segmented,
flat and concave,

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.400
alternating flat and concave
segments that look like a gourd

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:16.731
or a pumpkin dome,
probably designed by Hadrian

01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:17.320
himself.
 

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.670
Here's a closer view showing
you the same.

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:24.320
Baths, there are two baths at
Hadrian's Villa.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:28.789
One of them--I show you only
the Large Baths here,

01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:33.257
of Hadrian's Villa,
which dates to the early phase

01:04:33.257 --> 01:04:34.900
of 125 to 133.
 

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:36.190
I'm not going to say too much
about these.

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:37.610
I'm not going to show you the
plan.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.163
But just to make the point that
the villa has,

01:04:40.163 --> 01:04:43.000
not one, but two baths,
and they are gargantuan.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.409
Look at the size of this.
 

01:04:44.409 --> 01:04:47.074
Look at the tourists here in
relationship to the so-called

01:04:47.074 --> 01:04:47.730
Large Baths.
 

01:04:47.730 --> 01:04:50.958
This is a private bathing
establishment,

01:04:50.958 --> 01:04:56.010
but it shows you that Hadrian
has learned well from Trajan.

01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.885
If Trajan's Forum was the
mother of all forums,

01:04:58.885 --> 01:05:02.322
this is the mother of all
private bath buildings that we

01:05:02.322 --> 01:05:04.010
see at Hadrian's Villa.
 

01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:06.952
And we also see the expert way
in which these architects used

01:05:06.952 --> 01:05:08.130
concrete construction.
 

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:09.320
It's extraordinary.
 

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:12.940
Look at these vaults,
vaults that are springing,

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:15.659
just as they did in Hadrian's
market hall,

01:05:15.659 --> 01:05:17.619
in the Markets in Rome,
springing from--

01:05:17.619 --> 01:05:20.989
groin vaults that spring from a
bracket,

01:05:20.989 --> 01:05:23.659
rather than from a column or a
pilaster.

01:05:23.659 --> 01:05:26.548
And look at the way in which
they've been able to open up

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:28.840
this wall,
dematerialize the wall with

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:31.480
very large windows:
very sophisticated use of

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.980
concrete construction.
 

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.742
Here a detail of the groin
vaults springing from the

01:05:36.742 --> 01:05:40.579
bracket, with the stucco
decoration that you can also

01:05:40.579 --> 01:05:41.170
see.
 

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:47.045
Very quickly I also want to
show you the so-called Piazza

01:05:47.045 --> 01:05:49.557
d'Oro,
or the Golden Plaza,

01:05:49.557 --> 01:05:54.344
which dates also to the early
phase of the Villa of Hadrian at

01:05:54.344 --> 01:05:56.070
Tivoli, 125 to 133.
 

01:05:56.070 --> 01:06:00.449
You can see just by looking at
its plan that it's interesting.

01:06:00.449 --> 01:06:04.117
It was used as an audience hall
when Hadrian greeted important

01:06:04.117 --> 01:06:05.559
visitors at the villa.
 

01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:07.239
If you look at the entrance
vestibule,

01:06:07.239 --> 01:06:10.530
it's octagonal,
just like the octagonal room of

01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:12.760
Rabirius,
with a pumpkin vault,

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.239
then a great open rectangular
space,

01:06:15.239 --> 01:06:17.260
fairly traditional,
surrounded by columns.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:19.905
And then over here,
the audience hall or

01:06:19.905 --> 01:06:22.010
aula, a-u-l-a,
itself.

01:06:22.010 --> 01:06:25.730
This is an amazing structure,
and what makes the aula

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:29.387
particularly interesting and
important is like the Pantheon

01:06:29.387 --> 01:06:32.920
it combines traditional and
innovative architecture;

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.904
it combines concrete
construction with traditional

01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:37.851
vocabulary of Greek
architecture,

01:06:37.851 --> 01:06:39.010
namely columns.
 

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:41.380
There is an annular vault over
here.

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:44.849
You can see that the walls of
this structure undulate,

01:06:44.849 --> 01:06:48.384
but this undulation is
particularly interesting because

01:06:48.384 --> 01:06:51.199
the walls are not made out of
concrete;

01:06:51.199 --> 01:06:55.139
we'll see that the walls are
made out of columns.

01:06:55.139 --> 01:06:58.478
Here I show you a cutaway,
axonometric view of the

01:06:58.478 --> 01:07:00.862
aula,
where you can see these

01:07:00.862 --> 01:07:03.708
undulating walls,
making a kind of cruciform

01:07:03.708 --> 01:07:07.610
shape, but you can see that they
are supported by columns.

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:10.528
So again this fascinating
bringing together of the

01:07:10.528 --> 01:07:13.389
traditional vocabulary of Greek
architecture,

01:07:13.389 --> 01:07:17.688
namely columns,
with a concrete pumpkin dome on

01:07:17.688 --> 01:07:21.594
top: use of innovative,
of the traditional vocabulary

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.530
of architecture in an innovative
way.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:26.914
One might even call this an
example of the so-called baroque

01:07:26.914 --> 01:07:29.666
trend in Roman antiquity,
which we'll be talking about

01:07:29.666 --> 01:07:32.403
increasingly,
and I want you to be aware that

01:07:32.403 --> 01:07:33.570
it happens here.
 

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:37.693
Just very quickly,
the very sculptural vestibule

01:07:37.693 --> 01:07:39.938
entranceway,
so inspired by Rabirius,

01:07:39.938 --> 01:07:42.322
of the Piazza d'Oro,
showing this concrete

01:07:42.322 --> 01:07:44.880
construction with a pumpkin
dome,

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:48.856
and then a detail of some of
the columns along that

01:07:48.856 --> 01:07:52.273
undulating,
that curved or undulating wall,

01:07:52.273 --> 01:07:55.619
that are still preserved in the
aula.

01:07:55.619 --> 01:08:01.335
I want to show you also lastly
at Hadrian's Villa the so-called

01:08:01.335 --> 01:08:04.880
Teatro Marittimo,
the Maritime Theater,

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.606
which dates to the very
earliest of the phases,

01:08:08.606 --> 01:08:09.739
118 to 128.
 

01:08:09.739 --> 01:08:12.400
This was the building--Hadrian
started with this first,

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.469
because this is what he wanted
most of all--

01:08:14.469 --> 01:08:16.439
which was an island villa
within a villa,

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:19.439
a place where he could really
go if he wanted to be alone,

01:08:19.439 --> 01:08:21.170
even at his own villa.
 

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.942
And one can imagine him
escaping here,

01:08:23.942 --> 01:08:26.039
with Antinous by his side.
 

01:08:26.039 --> 01:08:28.060
We see that island villa here.
 

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.788
It's a round structure.
 

01:08:29.788 --> 01:08:34.694
In order to protect himself,
once he crossed the drawbridge,

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:39.850
he has placed a moat around the
island villa within a villa.

01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:41.828
But if you look at the plan of
that island villa,

01:08:41.828 --> 01:08:44.130
you would think that Rabirius
was still alive,

01:08:44.130 --> 01:08:47.911
in the sense of that compass
work that we saw Rabirius doing

01:08:47.911 --> 01:08:50.859
in the private wing of the Domus
Augustana,

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:53.368
playing off convex against
concave.

01:08:53.368 --> 01:08:57.804
But the difference between this
and what Rabirius did is this

01:08:57.804 --> 01:09:02.460
combines, in this very exciting
way, concrete walls and concrete

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.158
domes with columns.
 

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:10.050
We see that same combination
here.

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:11.765
Here's a view of what the
island within the Teatro

01:09:11.765 --> 01:09:12.779
Marittimo looks like today.
 

01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:14.939
Here's the island,
surrounded by the moat.

01:09:14.939 --> 01:09:18.362
And you can see this wonderful
combination of brick-faced

01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:20.731
concrete construction,
with columns,

01:09:20.731 --> 01:09:24.554
but if you look at the columns
you will see that they follow

01:09:24.554 --> 01:09:27.600
the curvature of the foundation
of the wall.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.997
So this again,
a combination of traditional

01:09:29.997 --> 01:09:31.710
and innovative architecture.
 

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.557
Another view of the moat,
of a colonnade with Ionic

01:09:34.557 --> 01:09:36.609
capitals that surrounds the
hall,

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:40.960
and then another view of the
island part,

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:46.907
with this wonderful interaction
of columnar and concrete

01:09:46.907 --> 01:09:48.529
architecture.
 

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:52.689
Lastly, I just want to show you
the Tomb of Hadrian,

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.788
and make a very few points
about it.

01:09:55.788 --> 01:09:59.149
The Tomb of Hadrian,
the famous Mausoleum of

01:09:59.149 --> 01:10:00.805
Hadrian,
better known as the Castel

01:10:00.805 --> 01:10:03.113
Sant'Angelo in Rome,
was put up at the end of

01:10:03.113 --> 01:10:06.608
Hadrian's reign,
between 135 and his death in

01:10:06.608 --> 01:10:09.850
138, and consecrated by his
successor,

01:10:09.850 --> 01:10:11.649
Antoninus Pius.
 

01:10:11.649 --> 01:10:15.113
It is located in the part of
Rome that we have not explored

01:10:15.113 --> 01:10:18.457
thus far, because very few
ancient buildings survive from

01:10:18.457 --> 01:10:20.010
that part of the city.
 

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:22.895
We are looking at an excellent
Google Earth view of the Tiber

01:10:22.895 --> 01:10:23.279
River.
 

01:10:23.279 --> 01:10:27.850
You will notice the Piazza
Navona over here,

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:30.774
the great stadium over here,
and we should be able to see

01:10:30.774 --> 01:10:34.445
the Pantheon,
but it may be cut off,

01:10:34.445 --> 01:10:39.654
in this view,
as is the Tomb of Augustus,

01:10:39.654 --> 01:10:43.050
which is located over here.
 

01:10:43.050 --> 01:10:47.152
But we can see well the Castel
Sant'Angelo of Hadrian's

01:10:47.152 --> 01:10:50.800
Mausoleum, fronted by a bridge
over the Tiber.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.109
And that's the Vatican,
Vatican City,

01:10:53.109 --> 01:10:54.198
up right above.
 

01:10:54.198 --> 01:10:57.688
So Hadrian chose a location
across the Tiber,

01:10:57.688 --> 01:11:02.050
where there were some imperial
gardens, for his tomb.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.242
Here you can better see,
also Google Earth,

01:11:04.242 --> 01:11:07.010
a view of the Castel
Sant'Angelo as it looks today.

01:11:07.010 --> 01:11:09.966
The walls and the watchtowers
were added later,

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.988
because this served as a
fortress for the popes,

01:11:12.988 --> 01:11:14.210
in the Vatican.
 

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:16.949
The popes, in bad times,
they had an underground

01:11:16.949 --> 01:11:20.273
passageway that they could
scurry from the Vatican to this

01:11:20.273 --> 01:11:22.988
fortress,
where they could be protected,

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:26.470
and that's when the watchtowers
and so on were added,

01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:28.939
as you can see here,
fronted by a bridge.

01:11:28.939 --> 01:11:32.060
This is the famous Ponte
Sant'Angelo, designed by

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.113
Bernini, the great
seventeenth-century architect

01:11:35.113 --> 01:11:37.520
Bernini, with a series of
angels.

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.659
And here another view of the
Castel Sant'Angelo,

01:11:40.659 --> 01:11:43.198
with Bernini's angels on the
bridge.

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:46.251
The most important point for
us, as you can see,

01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:49.238
that although tombs,
round tombs were no longer

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:52.420
au courant in the second
century A.D.;

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:56.078
they had gone out of fashion.
 

01:11:56.078 --> 01:11:57.806
Remember, Titus buried in his
arch, Trajan buried in his

01:11:57.806 --> 01:11:58.090
column.
 

01:11:58.090 --> 01:12:01.408
They really weren't doing round
tombs, at the extent that they

01:12:01.408 --> 01:12:02.770
had been doing earlier.
 

01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:04.090
Hadrian chooses this.
 

01:12:04.090 --> 01:12:04.338
Why?
 

01:12:04.338 --> 01:12:07.948
Because the great Mausoleum of
Augustus was a round tomb.

01:12:07.948 --> 01:12:10.478
He wants to associate himself
with Augustus,

01:12:10.478 --> 01:12:13.536
and he wants to create a new
tomb for a succession of

01:12:13.536 --> 01:12:14.359
dynasties.
 

01:12:14.359 --> 01:12:19.020
Nerva was the last to be buried
in the Mausoleum of Augustus;

01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:22.637
Hadrian the first in this
mausoleum, which continued to be

01:12:22.637 --> 01:12:24.479
used in the second century.
 

01:12:24.479 --> 01:12:29.055
And so it uses the Mausoleum of
Augustus and the Caecilia

01:12:29.055 --> 01:12:31.100
Metella tomb as models.
 

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.630
We have seen this model here,
of the Tomb of Hadrian.

01:12:34.630 --> 01:12:38.779
It's round, made out of
concrete, placed,

01:12:38.779 --> 01:12:42.350
as the Caecilia Metella tomb
was, on a podium,

01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:45.899
a very tall podium,
probably a tumulus on top,

01:12:45.899 --> 01:12:48.020
earthen tumulus,
like Augustus' tomb.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.728
We don't know what happened at
the very apex,

01:12:50.728 --> 01:12:53.990
whether there was a statue of
Hadrian or a temple-like

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:55.899
structure, as you see here.
 

01:12:55.899 --> 01:12:59.969
But the most important point
for us is that at the end of his

01:12:59.969 --> 01:13:04.037
life Hadrian is continuing to
connect himself to Rome's first

01:13:04.037 --> 01:13:05.693
emperor,
to Augustus,

01:13:05.693 --> 01:13:09.043
both of them in perpetuity
philhellenic emperors with

01:13:09.043 --> 01:13:12.627
philhellenic leanings,
but in the case of both of

01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:15.980
them, and particularly Hadrian,
he combines it with this new

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:17.380
concrete architecture in a very
special,

01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.835
very distinctive way,
that will have a lasting impact

01:13:20.835 --> 01:13:23.359
on architecture in the Roman
Empire.

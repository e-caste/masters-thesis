00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.983
Prof: Today we begin a
slightly different portion of

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:04.760
our course.
 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.867
We'll be talking about the
periods in the history of music

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:16.235
beginning with the Middle Ages,
and I've pit--put--the names of

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:19.519
those periods that we will be
covering in our course up here

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.410
on the board.
 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.995
Obviously: Medieval,
Renaissance,

00:00:22.995 --> 00:00:26.468
Baroque, Classical,
Romantic, Impressionist,

00:00:26.468 --> 00:00:27.600
Modernism.
 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.456
We could even add to that
Post-Modernist now and probably

00:00:31.456 --> 00:00:34.830
throw into that Popular Music in
a general way.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.899
We're going to begin here with
Gregorian chant,

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.636
talking about the traditional
music of the Roman Catholic

00:00:41.636 --> 00:00:42.370
Church.
 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.421
We will not be promoting in
here the values of the Roman

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:50.693
Catholic Church any more than we
promoted the values of the

00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:55.333
Jewish religion when we listened
to klezmer music or the Islamic

00:00:55.333 --> 00:01:00.490
religion when we listened to the
Adhan or we will be promoting--

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.558
we will not,
in fact, be promoting the

00:01:02.558 --> 00:01:05.578
Lutheran tradition when we deal
with Bach next time.

00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:07.950
This ain't religion in this
course;

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500
this is art.
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.858
So with that understood,
let's begin with an

00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:17.780
introduction to medieval music
starting with Gregorian chant.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.739
What is Gregorian chant?
 

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:25.099
Gregorian chant is the
monophonic, one-line music--

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:31.962
monophonic, one-line music of
the Roman Catholic Church as it

00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:38.827
existed from the time of the
earliest church fathers up until

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:43.060
the time of the Council of
Trent.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.757
The Council of Trent,
as you may know from your

00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:47.119
history courses,
was a conclave held in the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.010
northern Italian town of Trento,
Italy, from 1545 to 1563 at

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:58.057
which time they tried to combat
the effects of the Protestant

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:02.777
Reformation,
instituting reforms within the

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:06.885
church,
purifying the existing church

00:02:06.885 --> 00:02:09.772
of Rome--
cleaning up the Catholic Church

00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:10.408
in effect.
 

00:02:10.408 --> 00:02:14.250
Among the things that got
purified were the art and the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.818
music.
 

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:18.665
No more nudity was allowed in
art and any nudity that was

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:22.098
already there in religious art
was painted over.

00:02:22.098 --> 00:02:26.680
Any sort of secular tombs were
taken out of the church.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.538
Snappy rhythms in church music
were proscribed.

00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:36.460
What music was sung henceforth
would be dictated by Rome.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.960
No more new chant was composed.
 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.462
So the composition of chant,
then, began all the way back

00:02:43.462 --> 00:02:47.966
slightly--shortly after the
death of Christ and continued

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.460
into the sixteenth century.
 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.208
What we call Gregorian chant
really went on for a period of

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:55.758
fifteen-hundred years.
 

00:02:55.758 --> 00:03:00.407
From this, it is obvious then,
that although it takes its name

00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:04.212
from Pope Gregory the First--
and you have his dates on the

00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:07.540
board over there,
Gregory the Great--Gregorian

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.370
chant had almost nothing to do
with Gregory.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.400
Gregory was a church
administrator,

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.889
a writer of sermons,
and an important theologian,

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.935
but it's only an historical
accident that he is associated

00:03:21.935 --> 00:03:25.210
with this vast repertoire of
chant.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.241
Gregory had an influential
biographer, John the Deacon,

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.601
who ascribed,
perhaps, more to Gregory than

00:03:30.601 --> 00:03:32.229
he actually accomplished.
 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:35.410
And, generally speaking,
in the Middle Ages there was

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.774
this tendency to ascribe to a
single or a couple of male

00:03:38.774 --> 00:03:42.199
authority figures a lot more
than they actually did.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.348
The point here is that
Gregorian chant was being

00:03:45.348 --> 00:03:49.235
composed five hundred years
before Gregory set foot on this

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:52.520
earth and nearly a thousand
years after that.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.960
What's the purpose of Gregorian
chant?

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.849
What did it do?
 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:56.860
Well, it did two things.
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.169
One, it communicated the
message of the church.

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:03.281
It allowed for the transmission
of the word of God as they,

00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:05.832
the faithful,
understood the word and

00:04:05.832 --> 00:04:07.180
understood God.
 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.735
And it transmitted the
theology, the message,

00:04:10.735 --> 00:04:12.030
of the church.
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.925
Chant, then,
was a medium for the

00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:19.449
broadcast--literally--the
broadcast of the word.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.910
In a resonant acoustical
environment such as a stone or

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.281
stucco church,
one can project,

00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:29.927
one can impel a text better if
you sing it rather than just

00:04:29.927 --> 00:04:32.329
simply declaim it as usual.
 

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:36.636
I could say for example,
"Now let us read the

00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:41.471
Epistle of the Blessed Apostle
Paul to the Romans,"

00:04:41.471 --> 00:04:47.360
but the text projects better if
I sing it &gt;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.620
in that fashion.
 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.810
It goes out better and it can
reverberate better.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.966
Chant used for direct reading,
directly communicating a text,

00:04:56.966 --> 00:04:59.629
was generally syllabic chant.
 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.896
In syllabic chant each syllable
has just one note,

00:05:03.896 --> 00:05:08.860
and in syllabic chant the
musical range tends to be rather

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.819
narrow.
 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:14.786
The second purpose of chant:
Chant also allowed for a period

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:19.670
of reflection upon the subject
of the preceding reading.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.910
A sermon, or a passage,
of scripture would be followed

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.750
by a reflective chant,
time for contemplation.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.574
This music for reflection upon
a preceding religious theme was

00:05:33.574 --> 00:05:35.769
generally melismatic.
 

00:05:35.769 --> 00:05:40.122
Now a melismatic chant is one
in which there are many notes

00:05:40.122 --> 00:05:44.649
for just one syllable of text,
and in melismatic chant,

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.810
the range tends to be a lot
broader.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.540
It's more virtuosic.
 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.180
So simple chanting for
readings, that's syllabic chant.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.319
More complex chant for moments
of personal feeling and

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.290
reflection, that's melismatic
chant.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.660
Let's take an example here.
 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.427
I have my venerable Liber
Usualis up here,

00:06:06.427 --> 00:06:09.598
and I'm going to sing the
Alleluia for Easter Sunday--at

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:11.790
least I'm going to try to sing
it.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.827
And it's an example of a
melismatic chant and you'll

00:06:16.827 --> 00:06:20.680
notice one syllable here,
"ah"

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.730
is conveyed by probably thirty
notes.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:52.800
&gt;
 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.752
So that's a melismatic chant,
a moment of joyful celebration

00:06:57.752 --> 00:07:01.528
associated with the resurrection
of Christ.

00:07:01.528 --> 00:07:05.970
So that's what chant did,
and that's what it does today.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.487
It is firstly a medium for the
projection of sacred text and

00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:14.240
secondly a vehicle for spiritual
contemplation.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.589
Where was chant sung?
 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:19.846
Well, early on chant was sung
not so much in what we would

00:07:19.846 --> 00:07:22.589
call public churches but more in
sequestered--

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:26.410
usually rural--monasteries,
religious communities

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:30.060
segregated by gender--
what, specifically,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.377
we would call monasteries for
men and convents or nunneries

00:07:35.377 --> 00:07:36.569
for women.
 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:40.641
Remember Hamlet enjoining
Ophelia, "Get thee to a

00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.870
nunnery."
 

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.651
The dominant monastic order for
both male and female in the

00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:51.514
Middle Ages was the Benedictine
Order founded by Benedict of

00:07:51.514 --> 00:07:55.720
Nursia near Rome about five
thirty Common Era,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.920
the dates and names spelled out
on the board.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.108
From Benedict,
the church received a code of

00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:05.485
conduct prescribing how monks
and nuns should live the ideal

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.379
spiritual life while on this
earth.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:09.810
Here is that book.
 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.194
I once purchased this at the
Monastery of Saint John in

00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:15.764
Collegeville,
Minnesota, about sixty miles

00:08:15.764 --> 00:08:17.269
west of Minneapolis.
 

00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:20.819
So this is the Rule of Saint
Benedict.

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:23.839
It told the clergy how to spend
the day.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:27.629
It applied equally to male and
female communities.

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:32.893
The day was divided into
periods of work and periods of

00:08:32.893 --> 00:08:36.304
worship--praying,
singing, chanting,

00:08:36.304 --> 00:08:38.450
reading scripture.
 

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.150
They worked so as to feed
themselves and they prayed so as

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.580
to save their souls.
 

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.580
They were not so much
interested in good works for the

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.259
community.
 

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.041
They'd sort of withdrawn from
the community,

00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:53.211
but in personal salvation,
saving their own souls,

00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:55.798
perhaps the souls of others as
well.

00:08:55.798 --> 00:08:59.235
The periods during which they
worshipped were called the

00:08:59.235 --> 00:09:00.360
canonical hours.
 

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.511
The word "canon"
in Latin literally means

00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:04.710
"rule."
 

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.480
A canon is a musical
composition that follows a

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.629
strict rule.
 

00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:13.572
One voice has got to follow
another exactly in terms of

00:09:13.572 --> 00:09:16.639
rhythm and pitch from beginning
to end,

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:19.320
but here we have something a
little bit different,

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.059
canonical hours following the
rule,

00:09:22.059 --> 00:09:24.990
the canon, of Saint Benedict.
 

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.793
The hours usually involved
praying and reading scripture

00:09:29.793 --> 00:09:31.278
and in singing.
 

00:09:31.278 --> 00:09:35.240
And they started early in the
morning about four o'clock in

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.519
most houses at a canonical hour
called Matins.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.741
Next they would go on to
celebrate Lauds about daybreak,

00:09:42.741 --> 00:09:46.581
and so on around the hours,
ending with Vespers and

00:09:46.581 --> 00:09:47.580
Compline.
 

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.952
And I might ask you here--we
actually have this service in

00:09:50.952 --> 00:09:53.259
the Yale community,
broadly speaking.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:57.428
It's not particularly
religiously oriented at all.

00:09:57.428 --> 00:10:00.933
Have any of you gone to the
Compline service at Christ

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.580
Church across from the Yale
Bookstore?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.830
As I say, it's not particularly
denominational in any way.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:08.919
It's mostly in the dark.
 

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.750
It's very reflective.
 

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.200
Yes, Michael has.
 

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.769
I see some other people have as
well.

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:15.980
You might check that out Sunday
at ten o'clock in the evening.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:19.360
It's just a lovely time for
peace and quiet and reflection,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.001
and you can think about any god
that you wish in there and think

00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:24.287
about--
and perhaps work through any

00:10:24.287 --> 00:10:27.490
personal issues that you might
want to engage.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.976
As to the mass of the day--we
usually think of this as the

00:10:30.976 --> 00:10:32.200
principal service.
 

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.990
That, strictly speaking,
was not a canonical hour.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.190
It was a special service that
happened, usually,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.868
at around nine o'clock,
celebrated at the high altar of

00:10:41.868 --> 00:10:42.889
the church.
 

00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:47.937
So that's what the clergy did
in the Middle Ages by way of

00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:53.072
worship: gathering at these
prescribed times to pray and to

00:10:53.072 --> 00:10:53.870
sing.
 

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.230
And that's what the clergy
still does in Benedictine houses

00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:59.658
around the world.
 

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:03.253
The most authentic of these
Benedictine houses is the one

00:11:03.253 --> 00:11:06.269
that you see on the screen here
at Solesmes,

00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:09.408
about one hundred fifteen miles
south of Paris.

00:11:09.408 --> 00:11:13.374
Some years back I had the
pleasure of living there for ten

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:15.600
days to study Gregorian chant.
 

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.548
When you arrive,
the abbot comes out to greet

00:11:18.548 --> 00:11:18.950
you.
 

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.048
He's attended on either side by
two acolytes,

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:25.995
and you go through a ceremony
of--in which he washes your

00:11:25.995 --> 00:11:26.700
hands.
 

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:30.291
This washing of the hands was a
traditional--still is a

00:11:30.291 --> 00:11:33.881
traditional gesture by the
Benedictines of hospitality,

00:11:33.881 --> 00:11:36.210
and to some extent of humility.
 

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.870
You, the visitor,
are assigned to a cell.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.490
Let's have the next slide,
Jacob, please.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.240
There we go.
 

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.991
Okay, and I'll just signal
those.

00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:45.649
All right.
 

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:46.830
So there we are with the next
slide.

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.480
You are assigned a room.
 

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.792
All right.
 

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:49.509
Let's go back to this.
 

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.359
You're assigned a room,
and this building has been

00:11:52.359 --> 00:11:55.673
worked over, but that's where,
actually, I stayed--in that

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:56.428
building.
 

00:11:56.428 --> 00:11:59.871
In that room you have a light
bulb, you have a desk,

00:11:59.871 --> 00:12:01.830
you have a bed,
some fruit.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.090
You have no radio.
 

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.495
You have no clock,
no television,

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:07.750
and certainly no cell phone!
 

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.356
How then do you get up to
attend the canonical hours

00:12:11.356 --> 00:12:15.529
because in order to be in this
monastery you are required to

00:12:15.529 --> 00:12:18.360
attend all of these canonical
hours?

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.870
What is it that wakes you up
then, would you imagine?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.620
Hm?
 

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.038
Student:
&gt;

00:12:24.038 --> 00:12:24.726
Prof: Bells.
 

00:12:24.726 --> 00:12:25.559
Nice and loud,
please.

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:25.950
Student: Bells.
 

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.721
Prof: Okay.
 

00:12:26.721 --> 00:12:27.535
Thank you, Michael.
 

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:27.879
Bells.
 

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:30.519
Okay, the ringing of the bells.
 

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:34.282
They begin to regulate your
existence, for each of these

00:12:34.282 --> 00:12:36.950
signal each of these canonical
hours.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.482
Indeed we get our word
"clock"

00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:42.601
from the medieval French word
"cloche,"

00:12:42.601 --> 00:12:44.940
"bell,"
and our word--

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.095
the very word "hour"
comes from the Latin

00:12:48.095 --> 00:12:50.366
"ora,"
"to pray,"

00:12:50.366 --> 00:12:53.269
"orazio,"
or "prayer."

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:57.422
So we have the sense of praying
at regular times,

00:12:57.422 --> 00:13:00.450
regular intervals around the
day.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:05.998
At Solesmes the bells call you
to the church to hear these

00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:07.750
canonical hours.
 

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:14.639
They call you to the refectory
to consume your meals.

00:13:14.639 --> 00:13:18.136
And I submit that you really
haven't dined in this world

00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:21.698
until you sit down and break
dark brown bread with eighty

00:13:21.698 --> 00:13:24.370
hooded Benedictines speaking in
Latin.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.173
if, when they are not speaking,
they are tapping particular

00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:31.080
signals on the table.
 

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:33.985
And suddenly everybody will
rise, suddenly everybody will

00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:36.883
bow,
and the visitor is sort of left

00:13:36.883 --> 00:13:41.379
perplexed as to what is
transpiring but that's what goes

00:13:41.379 --> 00:13:41.870
on.
 

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.666
As I have said,
this rule of Saint Benedict

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:48.327
formulated in the sixth century
prescribed this cycle of

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.658
canonical hours.
 

00:13:49.658 --> 00:13:54.871
As the Middle Ages proceeded,
the cycle of hours was adopted

00:13:54.871 --> 00:13:59.466
at cathedral churches even
though the strict rule for

00:13:59.466 --> 00:14:01.940
communal living was not.
 

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.433
The daily timetable of worship
was kept, but the idea of eating

00:14:06.433 --> 00:14:09.190
and sleeping together was
abandoned.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.799
Cathedrals were much more urban
in their location.

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:14.019
They were not withdrawn.
 

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.028
They were in cities.
 

00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:19.111
The clergy administered to the
spiritual and social needs of

00:14:19.111 --> 00:14:20.220
the community.
 

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.578
The clergy was celibate,
de jure if not de

00:14:23.578 --> 00:14:24.370
facto.
 

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:29.090
They lived in private homes,
not in a communal dormitory,

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:33.808
in houses that were situated
all around the cathedral.

00:14:33.808 --> 00:14:37.297
Let's take a look at a typical
medieval cathedral,

00:14:37.297 --> 00:14:40.429
and for this I'm going to
choose Chartres.

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:42.210
Now, it's not typical.
 

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:43.820
It's the most beautiful.
 

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.885
If you have one cathedral to go
to, I strongly--and I think I've

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:49.611
been to all--I know that I've
been to all the big ones in

00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:50.830
France-- Romanesque .
 

00:14:50.830 --> 00:16:02.049
 
 

00:16:02.049 --> 00:16:04.168
What we saw before was gothic.
 

00:16:04.168 --> 00:16:10.985
So here we see a group of
clerics centering around Bishop

00:16:10.985 --> 00:16:14.759
Fulbertus there to the right.
 

00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:19.158
This illumination dates from
right around the year 1020.

00:16:19.158 --> 00:16:23.844
We'll return to Fulbertus and
hear one of his chants at the

00:16:23.844 --> 00:16:26.672
end of our hour,
but for the moment,

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:30.629
let's pass on to the women on
the left there.

00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:32.960
Notice that they are out to the
side.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.029
They've been segregated.
 

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:36.980
Indeed they are physically
marginalized.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.130
Women were to be silent in the
church according to the

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.360
scriptural dictum of Saint Paul:
"Mulier taceat in

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.850
ecclesia."
 

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:50.541
But, as we have seen,
there was ample opportunity for

00:16:50.541 --> 00:16:53.876
spiritual contemplation and
creativity for women

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:56.220
specifically in the convents.
 

00:16:56.220 --> 00:17:00.846
One spiritual leader within the
community of Benedictine

00:17:00.846 --> 00:17:03.788
convents was Hildegard of
Bingen.

00:17:03.788 --> 00:17:06.568
Hildegard lived in the twelfth
century.

00:17:06.568 --> 00:17:09.965
She came from the area of
Bingen on the West Bank of the

00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:11.509
Rhine River in Germany.
 

00:17:11.509 --> 00:17:14.348
She grew up in a Benedictine
convent.

00:17:14.348 --> 00:17:18.750
Here are the ruins of that
Benedictine convent.

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:22.390
And then she went on ultimately
to found her own convent,

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.200
and this is the--these are the
ruins--

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:28.789
or a seventeenth-century
drawing of that convent which is

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:30.430
now also in ruins.
 

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.660
Hildegard was a polymath.
 

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:35.009
She could do many things.
 

00:17:35.009 --> 00:17:37.423
She wrote on church
administration,

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:41.328
on botany, on pharmacology,
on medicine and on music.

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:45.527
Indeed because of this
diversity we can I think fairly

00:17:45.527 --> 00:17:49.090
say that the first
"Renaissance Man"

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.180
in actuality was a medieval
woman,

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:53.890
Hildegard of Bingen.
 

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:57.035
Popes and bishops sought her
advice--in part,

00:17:57.035 --> 00:17:59.180
because she was a visionary.
 

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.328
She had visions associated with
the Christian story.

00:18:02.328 --> 00:18:06.348
Hildegard also wrote Gregorian
chants.

00:18:06.348 --> 00:18:08.299
So let's look at some slides of
Hildegard.

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:09.720
She was famous in her day.
 

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.740
Here we have a manuscript put
together in northern Italy about

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:17.298
twenty years after her death
with the representation of

00:18:17.298 --> 00:18:19.868
Hildegard up there on the top
left.

00:18:19.868 --> 00:18:23.910
The next slide takes us to a
blowup of this and we see the

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.880
representation of Hildegard
having a celestial vision.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.349
That's why the wavy lines going
up from her head.

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:33.160
She's receiving the Holy Spirit.
 

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.981
She is copying down what she
perceives--not on a notebook

00:18:38.981 --> 00:18:45.324
computer, but on a wax tablet
with a large stylus in her right

00:18:45.324 --> 00:18:46.259
hand.
 

00:18:46.259 --> 00:18:50.192
Her assistant--the one male
allowed in this community for

00:18:50.192 --> 00:18:53.491
the sacraments--her assistant,
Volmar, peeks in,

00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:56.019
astonished at what he is
seeing.

00:18:56.019 --> 00:18:58.779
Another illustration of this
same sort,

00:18:58.779 --> 00:19:02.460
the phantasmagorical Trinity
here with God the Father,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.690
Christ the Warrior slaying the
devil that is now trampled under

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:10.615
his feet down below--
Hildegard is seeing all this as

00:19:10.615 --> 00:19:13.348
we see from this illumination
here.

00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:16.621
And a blowup of that again
shows us the wavy lines,

00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:20.808
the descent of the Holy Spirit,
the writing on the wax tablet.

00:19:20.808 --> 00:19:26.096
This time her assistant,
her favored assistant,

00:19:26.096 --> 00:19:31.960
Ricarda, looks in again on this
particular scene.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:36.266
Hildegard's music is
distinctive, and the texts that

00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:40.910
she created for this music are
even more remarkable,

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:43.130
more than any religious poet
that I know--

00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:44.848
and I have studied this to some
degree--

00:19:44.848 --> 00:19:47.890
religious poet of the Middle
Ages that I know.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.618
Her texts are the most
startling, her imagery the most

00:19:51.618 --> 00:19:55.348
vivid, the most graphic,
indeed the most beautiful.

00:19:55.348 --> 00:19:58.917
She talks of a saint in terms
of the "sweat of his

00:19:58.917 --> 00:20:02.222
goodness shining like a balm on
his forehead,"

00:20:02.222 --> 00:20:06.188
of the odor of the sanctity of
the Virgin Mary being "as

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:09.890
sweet as the scent of
honeysuckle and lilac."

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.172
Hildegard sees the blood of
Christ "streaming in the

00:20:13.172 --> 00:20:14.108
heavens."
 

00:20:14.108 --> 00:20:18.883
In her own musical creation,
with regard to them,

00:20:18.883 --> 00:20:24.553
she styles herself simply a
breath--a "feather on the

00:20:24.553 --> 00:20:26.940
breath of God."
 

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.463
What an interesting metaphor
but very appropriate for this

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:32.009
very modest individual.
 

00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:34.848
She was but a "feather on
the breath of God"

00:20:34.848 --> 00:20:37.259
with regard to her own personal
creations,

00:20:37.259 --> 00:20:40.900
carrying out--going wherever
God would send her.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.118
And you have on your CDs for
our course--

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:46.490
it's actually CD one,
track two--Hildegard's "O

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.058
Greenest Branch,"
and when you listen to this--

00:20:50.058 --> 00:20:52.351
it's actually the basis of a
Listening Exercise that we will

00:20:52.351 --> 00:20:54.105
get to--
when you listen to this,

00:20:54.105 --> 00:20:57.634
you might be interested to know
that this was recorded right in

00:20:57.634 --> 00:20:59.970
the base of Harkness Tower over
there.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:01.828
It was recorded in Branford
Chapel.

00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.769
And, although when you read the
liner notes,

00:21:04.769 --> 00:21:08.365
it will say the Hildegard
Singers, the Hildegard Singers

00:21:08.365 --> 00:21:11.308
were simply some female graduate
students,

00:21:11.308 --> 00:21:13.795
ladies that were here
interested in singing early

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:16.068
music that--
for that particular recording

00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:18.778
became what I labeled them,
the Hildegard Singers.

00:21:18.778 --> 00:21:22.221
So that recording was done over
at Branford Chapel,

00:21:22.221 --> 00:21:26.490
but let's listen to another one
from a group of four women from

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:27.730
New York City.
 

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.170
They're called Anonymous Four.
 

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.880
They put out wonderful
recordings.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.279
And it's a good example of
melismatic chant,

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:36.730
again by Hildegard of Bingen.
 

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.390
Now you have the text up on the
board here.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:41.380
I don't know if we can read it
but I'll read it off to you,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.055
"O rubor sanguinis,"
"O redness of blood,"

00:21:45.055 --> 00:21:47.463
"qui de excelso illo
fluxisti,"

00:21:47.463 --> 00:21:49.753
"that flow down from
heaven,"

00:21:49.753 --> 00:21:51.801
"quod divinitas
tetegit,"

00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.849
"which divinity
touched,"

00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:57.163
"Tu flos est,"
"You are the flower,"

00:21:57.163 --> 00:21:59.634
"quod hyems de flatu
serpentis,"

00:21:59.634 --> 00:22:03.430
which is "the wintry
breath of the servant--

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.660
serpent,"
in other words the devil,

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.460
"numquam lesit,"
"will never wound."

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.288
So that's the text.
 

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:15.130
Now let's listen to the music
of Hildegard of Bingen.

00:22:15.130 --> 00:23:53.318
&gt;
 

00:23:53.318 --> 00:23:57.318
So what can we say about chant
by way of conclusion?

00:23:57.318 --> 00:23:59.000
First of all,
of course, it is monophonic.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.650
We hear only one line there,
monophonic texture.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.980
Chant is monophonic.
 

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.420
Chant is also unaccompanied,
as you heard.

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.558
Chant has no meter,
no rhythm to it--no regular

00:24:09.558 --> 00:24:11.180
rhythm at least.
 

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:15.074
It seems to flow as Hildegard
says, "like a feather on

00:24:15.074 --> 00:24:16.818
the breath of God."
 

00:24:16.818 --> 00:24:20.710
Now chant is enjoying something
of a rebirth at the moment,

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:24.278
something of a resurgence of
interest ever since the

00:24:24.278 --> 00:24:29.103
appearance in nineteen six--
nineteen ninety-six of this CD

00:24:29.103 --> 00:24:32.098
simply called "Chant."
 

00:24:32.098 --> 00:24:35.368
It went platinum in its first
year, selling over a million

00:24:35.368 --> 00:24:38.180
copies, outselling the Beatles
even for a time.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.720
And it was succeeded by other
chant CDs, all produced,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.460
appropriately enough,
by Angel Records.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.866
We had "Chant II,"
"Chant III,"

00:24:47.866 --> 00:24:51.480
"Beyond Chant,"
"Son of Chant."

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.348
There were Hildegard knockoffs.
 

00:24:54.348 --> 00:25:00.519
We had "Mad About
Monks."

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:06.268
And if we had the original
Chant CD issued by the

00:25:06.268 --> 00:25:10.818
Benedictine Monks of Santo
Domingo,

00:25:10.818 --> 00:25:15.930
Spain, so, of course,
we have a knockoff now,

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.108
by the Benzedrine Monks of
Santa Monica,

00:25:19.108 --> 00:25:20.170
California.
 

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:20.676
Okay.
 

00:25:20.676 --> 00:25:25.950
Let's go on to the next slide,
which should be blank,

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.817
and I don't know what I did
with it but just last

00:25:30.817 --> 00:25:33.150
month--here it is.
 

00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:36.259
I don't have a good picture,
but just last month I went on

00:25:36.259 --> 00:25:36.970
CNN online.
 

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.848
You know, you can see the
headlines there.

00:25:38.848 --> 00:25:40.769
There was a headline:
"Move Over,

00:25:40.769 --> 00:25:41.598
Madonna."
 

00:25:41.598 --> 00:25:43.750
I think this was the other
Madonna.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.170
"Move over, Madonna.
 

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.089
A CD of Gregorian chant by a
group of Cistercian is a

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:53.838
surprise cross-over bestseller
reaching the pop charts."

00:25:53.838 --> 00:25:58.950
And you can actually buy this,
as I did, on Amazon or wherever

00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:00.710
you want to buy it.
 

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.259
Why all this interest in chant?
 

00:26:02.259 --> 00:26:05.789
Because it has much in common
with so-called "New

00:26:05.789 --> 00:26:06.990
Age" music.
 

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:10.509
Chant is non-confrontational,
non-assertive.

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:13.483
It is somewhat laid back,
if you will,

00:26:13.483 --> 00:26:17.743
as the mind and the spirit are
allowed to contemplate,

00:26:17.743 --> 00:26:20.960
to form a divine communion,
perhaps.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.348
Chant is the very opposite of
the music of Beethoven.

00:26:24.348 --> 00:26:27.661
Beethoven tries to convince you
to feel a particular way about

00:26:27.661 --> 00:26:29.126
every moment,
every measure,

00:26:29.126 --> 00:26:30.048
in his music.
 

00:26:30.048 --> 00:26:33.519
It is very much rhetorical
music.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:38.710
Chant, on the other hand,
you can take on your own terms.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.180
It is non-authoritarian.
 

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.950
It is non-assertive,
non-aggressive.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.848
It floats unfettered.
 

00:26:46.848 --> 00:26:50.346
And many of these same
characteristics are found in

00:26:50.346 --> 00:26:53.422
"New Age"
music--hence the newfound

00:26:53.422 --> 00:26:55.730
popularity of medieval chant.
 

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.838
Now let's turn our attention
away from chant,

00:26:59.838 --> 00:27:04.160
away form monophonic music to
early polyphony,

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.150
multi-voice music,
music of the church of the

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:09.890
Middle Ages,
the polyphonic music.

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:15.200
Early polyphonic music for the
church was called organum.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:19.595
It was first created in the
great urban gothic cathedrals of

00:27:19.595 --> 00:27:22.523
France,
most particularly at Notre-Dame

00:27:22.523 --> 00:27:24.814
of Paris,
so let's visit here our

00:27:24.814 --> 00:27:28.894
well-known Notre-Dame with the
west façade and then some

00:27:28.894 --> 00:27:32.845
of the famous laterally-added
flying buttresses around to the

00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:35.348
south side there,
the southeast side.

00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:41.607
It is likely not coincidental
that the high walls of this new

00:27:41.607 --> 00:27:45.259
gothic style were being
created--

00:27:45.259 --> 00:27:51.150
these courses of stone laid one
on top of the other--

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.720
at precisely the same time,
around twelve hundred,

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.759
that verticality was being
introduced to music.

00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:02.319
What I mean is that all
cathedral organum was built

00:28:02.319 --> 00:28:06.164
upward above a pre-existing
chant, above a pre-existing

00:28:06.164 --> 00:28:07.588
Gregorian chant.
 

00:28:07.588 --> 00:28:11.548
The composer took the chant and
placed it in the bottom voice

00:28:11.548 --> 00:28:14.980
and then added other voices up
on top of it to form a

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.828
counterpoint against it.
 

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:20.167
It was the job of the tenor to
take the chant and to hold it

00:28:20.167 --> 00:28:21.298
out in long notes.
 

00:28:21.298 --> 00:28:25.528
That's why the tenor is called
what it is.

00:28:25.528 --> 00:28:29.357
Originally, it comes from the
word Latin "teneo,"

00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:31.866
"I hold"
or "tenir"

00:28:31.866 --> 00:28:34.280
in modern French,
"to hold,"

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.338
the infinitive there.
 

00:28:35.338 --> 00:28:37.190
So that we have this idea of
one voice,

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:39.618
the chant, holding on in the
long notes underneath--

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:42.368
was kind of the basis of the
music,

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:46.368
and then up above the composer
would create new polyphony.

00:28:46.368 --> 00:28:52.579
What you see on the screen is
an example of this medieval

00:28:52.579 --> 00:28:53.690
organum.
 

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.632
You can see we have four lines
in each brace,

00:28:58.632 --> 00:28:59.980
in effect.
 

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:03.338
The one with "Vi"
has just one pitch.

00:29:03.338 --> 00:29:05.250
You can see the big
illumination there,

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.068
"V,"
and then the pitch F out to the

00:29:08.068 --> 00:29:10.330
right of it,
and it just sits there because

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:12.269
it just holds out the
&gt;

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:14.567
"Vi"
as the music goes on for many,

00:29:14.567 --> 00:29:17.022
many, many, many,
many, many seconds and finally

00:29:17.022 --> 00:29:18.588
goes &gt;
 

00:29:18.588 --> 00:29:20.028
"de,"
holds that out,

00:29:20.028 --> 00:29:22.910
and then finally down to the
bottom, &gt;

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.743
"runt,"
as all of this other polyphony

00:29:25.743 --> 00:29:26.890
goes on up above.
 

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.019
Let's listen to an example of
some of this medieval sound.

00:29:31.019 --> 00:30:46.078
&gt;
 

00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:46.825
All right.
 

00:30:46.825 --> 00:30:48.690
And we'll stop it there.
 

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.604
So it's very different,
but it's very complex at the

00:30:51.604 --> 00:30:52.288
same time.
 

00:30:52.288 --> 00:30:55.027
Again, a good example of
medieval organum,

00:30:55.027 --> 00:30:56.430
medieval polyphony.
 

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:00.221
But let's turn our attention
now away from the music of the

00:31:00.221 --> 00:31:03.619
Middle Ages in Paris to the
Renaissance and Rome--and

00:31:03.619 --> 00:31:06.170
specifically to the Sistine
Chapel.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:10.942
The Sistine Chapel was the most
famous of all churches in the

00:31:10.942 --> 00:31:14.443
late fifteenth and early
sixteenth centuries,

00:31:14.443 --> 00:31:16.990
the core of the Renaissance.
 

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.279
Why?
 

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:21.132
Because it was the private
chapel of the pope--not St.

00:31:21.132 --> 00:31:23.528
Peter's, interestingly enough.
 

00:31:23.528 --> 00:31:25.615
This is a shot of modern-day
St.

00:31:25.615 --> 00:31:26.289
Peter's.
 

00:31:26.289 --> 00:31:27.680
Let's go--there we go.
 

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.000
But this was,
during the Renaissance,

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.795
only beginning to be
constructed following the design

00:31:35.795 --> 00:31:37.640
of who--of whom?
 

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.339
Which famous painter?
 

00:31:40.339 --> 00:31:41.848
Michelangelo.
 

00:31:41.848 --> 00:31:45.567
Yeah, Michelangelo was involved
in the design of St.

00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:49.575
Peter's, but this was not in
existence at the time we're

00:31:49.575 --> 00:31:53.291
under--discussing here,
big as--and impressive as it

00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:54.240
may be.
 

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:58.383
So where the pope was actually
worshipping for the most part in

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:00.119
this period was not in St.
 

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:03.193
Peter's, but next door,
in effect, over in this

00:32:03.193 --> 00:32:05.598
building in the Sistine Chapel.
 

00:32:05.598 --> 00:32:08.839
And here, of course,
because it was his own place of

00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:10.898
worship,
he could command the very

00:32:10.898 --> 00:32:13.509
best--the best materials and the
best artists,

00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:14.970
the best musicians.
 

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:20.958
Construction on the Sistine
Chapel began in 1477 during the

00:32:20.958 --> 00:32:26.534
reign of Pope Sixtus IV,
hence the name Sistine Chapel,

00:32:26.534 --> 00:32:28.598
Sixtus, Sistine.
 

00:32:28.598 --> 00:32:31.720
Obviously, you get the
etymological connection there.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.986
It's one hundred thirty-two
feet long and forty-five feet

00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:36.519
wide.
 

00:32:36.519 --> 00:32:39.138
The ceiling,
the famous ceiling of

00:32:39.138 --> 00:32:42.788
Michelangelo,
is seventy feet off the floor.

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:45.994
Michelangelo painted,
as you know,

00:32:45.994 --> 00:32:50.559
scenes from the Bible,
both the creation and the

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:51.920
expulsion.
 

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:59.086
He also painted scenes of the
sibyl prophets as written about

00:32:59.086 --> 00:33:03.028
by Virgil in the Aeneid.
 

00:33:03.028 --> 00:33:07.598
The side walls are covered with
frescoes of Botticelli,

00:33:07.598 --> 00:33:09.630
Perugino, and Raphael.
 

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:12.250
Here is one by Raphael.
 

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:17.469
At the east end where the high
altar was situated there is the

00:33:17.469 --> 00:33:22.088
famous Last Judgment scene by
Michelangelo himself,

00:33:22.088 --> 00:33:24.940
painted somewhat later in the
1530s.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.828
Just as the pope hired the best
painters,

00:33:27.828 --> 00:33:30.740
so he engaged the finest
musicians--

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:35.660
the incomparable Josquin des
Prez, who will be the focus of

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.528
your Listening Exercise sixteen,
and Giovanni Pierluigi da

00:33:40.528 --> 00:33:41.440
Palestrina.
 

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.664
You've probably may heard the
name Palestrina,

00:33:44.664 --> 00:33:47.390
a prototypical Renaissance
composer.

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:52.818
They composed and they sang
both chant and polyphony.

00:33:52.818 --> 00:33:55.618
They were members of the Papal
Chapel,

00:33:55.618 --> 00:33:59.200
so a chapel in this period,
and even today,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.980
can mean two things:
One, the physical building--

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.779
let's have another slide--the
physical building,

00:34:06.779 --> 00:34:08.480
so that's one kind of chapel.
 

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:13.393
And two, the musical ensemble,
the choir that performs in this

00:34:13.393 --> 00:34:18.432
building,
and the actual Papal Chapel--as

00:34:18.432 --> 00:34:22.985
you can see here,
there is a loggia that

00:34:22.985 --> 00:34:27.523
sticks out and this is where the
singers such as Josquin des Prez

00:34:27.523 --> 00:34:31.565
and Giovanni Pierluigi da
Palestrina would stand when they

00:34:31.565 --> 00:34:33.409
sang before the pope.
 

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:38.521
Now because this Papal Chapel
here sang without any

00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:42.920
accompaniment of instruments
whatsoever,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.407
even the organ,
that style of singing came to

00:34:45.407 --> 00:34:48.545
be called a cappella,
literally a cappella

00:34:48.545 --> 00:34:51.284
Sistina,
so unaccompanied singing means

00:34:51.284 --> 00:34:52.610
without instruments.
 

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.226
If you are in an a capella
singing group here at Yale,

00:34:56.226 --> 00:35:00.047
you are a descendant of this
tradition of singing without

00:35:00.047 --> 00:35:02.639
instruments in the Sistine
Chapel.

00:35:02.639 --> 00:35:04.070
That's what a cappella
means,

00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:08.329
"in the chapel,"
but literally in Pope Sixtus's

00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:10.780
chapel here,
singing without instruments.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.228
In this case the Papal Chapel
performed in the Papal Chapel

00:35:15.228 --> 00:35:17.056
standing in,
as mentioned,

00:35:17.056 --> 00:35:20.288
the loggia that you see
there on the lower right side of

00:35:20.288 --> 00:35:21.070
your screen.
 

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:24.268
Who were the members of the
Papal Chapel?

00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:27.420
Well, they were all male
clerics.

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:30.340
We've said that chant was
segregated by gender.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:34.018
There were also all-female
ensembles in this period,

00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:36.039
but they were in convents.
 

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:39.829
But in monasteries,
cathedrals, and here in the

00:35:39.829 --> 00:35:42.052
Papal Chapel,
then as today,

00:35:42.052 --> 00:35:44.690
the ensembles were all-male.
 

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:49.641
But if they were all male,
who then sang the soprano when

00:35:49.641 --> 00:35:51.940
polyphony was performed?
 

00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:56.489
Well, at various times this was
done in one of three ways.

00:35:56.489 --> 00:36:02.110
Males could sing in head voice,
which is called falsetto.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.579
Any of the gentlemen in here
ever tried to sing falsetto?

00:36:05.579 --> 00:36:19.789
&gt;
 

00:36:19.789 --> 00:36:21.480
It sounds pretty awful. Right?
 

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.579
Okay, but if I practiced that
it ain't bad.

00:36:24.579 --> 00:36:27.440
I never practice it,
but if I practiced that--

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.440
and you can practice that just
like you can any other voice,

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.224
and it begins to sound better
and better and it can function

00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:34.170
as a soprano line.
 

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.030
So that was option one.
 

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:41.114
Option two was to have
choirboys sing this upper part

00:36:41.114 --> 00:36:43.949
and,
as this illustration shows,

00:36:43.949 --> 00:36:48.409
this in many ways was a popular
medium of performance,

00:36:48.409 --> 00:36:51.369
the old men and the young
choirboys.

00:36:51.369 --> 00:36:55.364
But a third possibility that
came to be used in the Sistine

00:36:55.364 --> 00:36:58.945
Chapel during the sixteenth
century was to assign the

00:36:58.945 --> 00:37:03.306
soprano line to a castrato,
a male who had shown a

00:37:03.306 --> 00:37:09.579
promising singing voice as a boy
and had therefore been subjected

00:37:09.579 --> 00:37:15.460
to the process of castration to
maintain this high voice.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:19.153
Now, there was some economic
advantage to the castrato

00:37:19.153 --> 00:37:22.849
because one castrato could make
as much noise as three

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:25.219
falsettists or four choirboys.
 

00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:29.610
The castrato had a high voice
but a very big body.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:33.599
Now it has always seemed
profoundly ironic to me that the

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:37.876
one institution most fervently
in favor of castration of boys

00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:42.641
to produce this high,
powerful voice was the papacy,

00:37:42.641 --> 00:37:45.750
but that is an historical fact.
 

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:50.898
Indeed the popes continued to
engage and support castrati into

00:37:50.898 --> 00:37:53.429
the early twentieth century.
 

00:37:53.429 --> 00:37:57.166
We, in fact,
have a recording made in 1905

00:37:57.166 --> 00:38:01.541
of the last castrato to sing in
the Papal Chapel,

00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:03.730
Alessandro Moreschi.
 

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.449
His name is on the board.
 

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:09.268
I will now play a CD of this
voice.

00:38:09.268 --> 00:38:14.000
It will sound very unpleasant
for two reasons.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.335
One, the recording was made in
1905 so it's very old,

00:38:18.335 --> 00:38:23.088
and it has all the surface
noise that those old recordings

00:38:23.088 --> 00:38:23.840
have.
 

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.369
And two, Moreschi himself was
very old.

00:38:27.369 --> 00:38:30.128
He was about seventy when this
recording was made,

00:38:30.128 --> 00:38:33.226
and who has a good voice,
male or female--who has a good

00:38:33.226 --> 00:38:35.030
voice when they are seventy?
 

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:38.780
So it doesn't present the
castrato at its best,

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.652
but at least it will give you
an idea of the sound of this

00:38:42.652 --> 00:38:46.730
lost voice so we're going to
listen to a bit of castrato,

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.865
Alessandro Moreschi singing the
Bach/Gounod "Ave

00:38:50.865 --> 00:38:51.980
Maria."
 

00:38:51.980 --> 00:39:54.409
&gt;
 

00:39:54.409 --> 00:39:54.721
Okay.
 

00:39:54.721 --> 00:39:58.454
Let's turn from that very old
recording to a modern recording

00:39:58.454 --> 00:39:58.889
now.
 

00:39:58.889 --> 00:40:02.902
It's a recording of a piece by
Palestrina written around 1590

00:40:02.902 --> 00:40:04.909
for the Sistine Chapel here.
 

00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:09.059
It is a Sanctus from a mass.
 

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:11.923
And for the parts of the
mass--the Kyrie,

00:40:11.923 --> 00:40:16.150
the Gloria, etc.--see page
eighty-three of your textbook.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.860
So it's a Sanctus of the mass.
 

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:22.460
And just as we have the Hebrew
prophet Isaiah--

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:25.570
and I think we can bring that
up now with the next slide--

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:29.389
on the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel painted by Michelangelo--

00:40:29.389 --> 00:40:34.038
so we have the voice of Isaiah
in this mass and in this music

00:40:34.038 --> 00:40:37.059
for it is from Isaiah that the
text,

00:40:37.059 --> 00:40:38.900
"Sanctus,
sanctus, sanctus,

00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:42.260
Domine Deus Sabaoth"
comes,

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.170
"Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty."

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:49.099
Now this piece by Palestrina,
and I hope you--everybody got

00:40:49.099 --> 00:40:50.320
the sheet there?
 

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.630
We've got the sheet of music.
 

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:55.719
You can--there's enough light,
I think, generally to see what

00:40:55.719 --> 00:40:56.880
you have there.
 

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.259
It is written in four-voice
polyphony, but the aesthetic

00:41:02.259 --> 00:41:07.931
impact of this polyphony is
pretty much the same as that of

00:41:07.931 --> 00:41:08.909
chant.
 

00:41:08.909 --> 00:41:12.972
Instead of one line of chant,
now we have four independent

00:41:12.972 --> 00:41:15.110
lines, so we have polyphony.
 

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.760
Palestrina has taken a piece of
chant,

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.989
slightly--indeed what it was an
old hymn,

00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:24.844
a monophonic hymn--slightly
animated the line through the

00:41:24.844 --> 00:41:27.460
addition of simple rhythmic
values,

00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:32.719
and placed it in four voices so
as to amplify the sense.

00:41:32.719 --> 00:41:36.690
Four voices could do more to
amplify the sense of the chant.

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:40.110
Indeed this Sanctus has the
same relaxed,

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.148
non-aggressive,
unassertive,

00:41:42.148 --> 00:41:45.469
yet very beautiful style of
chant itself,

00:41:45.469 --> 00:41:50.800
even though there are now four
individual parts instead of one.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.909
We've got polyphony instead of
monophony.

00:41:52.909 --> 00:41:54.510
So you've got the music there.
 

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:58.413
Palestrina is overlaying,
sewing together here,

00:41:58.413 --> 00:42:03.418
four short chant-like phrases,
and I've numbered them on the

00:42:03.418 --> 00:42:05.710
sheet one through four.
 

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:10.391
Each of these phrases comes in,
in turn in each voice,

00:42:10.391 --> 00:42:13.925
each voice imitating the
preceding voice,

00:42:13.925 --> 00:42:17.460
so we've got imitative
counterpoint.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:23.239
These passages of counterpoint
are called points of imitation.

00:42:23.239 --> 00:42:26.400
This is what we get a lot of in
Renaissance music.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.809
So we have four points of
imitation.

00:42:28.809 --> 00:42:32.021
In point of fact,
it's--they sort of look like

00:42:32.021 --> 00:42:34.949
four very short expositions in a
fugue.

00:42:34.949 --> 00:42:38.432
But in this Sanctus,
in this imitative Sanctus of

00:42:38.432 --> 00:42:40.592
Palestrina,
each exposition,

00:42:40.592 --> 00:42:43.449
each of these four little
expositions,

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:47.233
has its own subject,
its own theme here rather than

00:42:47.233 --> 00:42:49.730
one dominating the whole fugue.
 

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:50.500
Okay.
 

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:55.231
So here are the
&gt;.

00:42:55.231 --> 00:43:00.347
This is number one,
&gt;

00:43:00.347 --> 00:43:05.719
, and then number-- point
number two begins

00:43:05.719 --> 00:43:09.300
&gt;.
 

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:15.159
Number three across the page
&gt;

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:25.940
and then finally
&gt;

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:27.889
in that fashion.
 

00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:30.278
So as we listen to this
recording now,

00:43:30.278 --> 00:43:32.409
I have a question for you here.
 

00:43:32.409 --> 00:43:35.269
Who is singing the soprano part?
 

00:43:35.269 --> 00:43:37.400
Are these women singing this?
 

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.030
Are these choirboys singing
this?

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:40.579
Are these falsettists singing
this?

00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:42.760
Are these castrati singing this?
 

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.650
Let's listen.
 

00:43:43.650 --> 00:45:47.489
&gt;
 

00:45:47.489 --> 00:45:52.063
So that imitative style,
relaxed, in terms of its

00:45:52.063 --> 00:45:56.690
expressive content,
is very much the essence of the

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:01.018
a cappella style of
Renaissance vocal music,

00:46:01.018 --> 00:46:04.360
and who was singing the soprano
part there,

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:05.460
of our four options?
 

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.719
Any thoughts about that?
 

00:46:06.719 --> 00:46:10.789
Elizabeth, I can--
Student: Falsettos?

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:11.929
Prof: Falsettists, yeah.
 

00:46:11.929 --> 00:46:15.811
That was a male falsettist
voice singing it--not women,

00:46:15.811 --> 00:46:17.824
not choirboys,
and of course,

00:46:17.824 --> 00:46:21.706
castrati are no longer an
option, so it was falsettists

00:46:21.706 --> 00:46:22.570
there.
 

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:22.905
Yeah.
 

00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:26.340
I'd like to end with one final
thing and that is--

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:29.949
enjoying myself today,
indulging myself,

00:46:29.949 --> 00:46:31.719
dressing up,
getting ready for Halloween--

00:46:31.719 --> 00:46:36.362
but the point of this,
in a way, is to try to give you

00:46:36.362 --> 00:46:40.998
a sense of what this music,
and it's a very esoteric kind

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.621
of music,
is about--but really,

00:46:42.621 --> 00:46:44.876
to do it in a classroom we
would have to take this whole

00:46:44.876 --> 00:46:47.215
class and have to go to the
Cathedral of Chartres and we'd

00:46:47.215 --> 00:46:49.800
have to sit there and we have to
be in front of a statue,

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.219
look at the beauty of that
statue.

00:46:51.219 --> 00:46:53.150
We'd have to look at the
architecture all around us.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.826
We'd have to look at the
beautiful copes on the back of

00:46:54.826 --> 00:46:55.230
the clergy.
 

00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:59.570
We would have to see the
beautiful stained glass.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:02.710
We would have to smell the
incense that is lighted.

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:04.954
I thought about doing that but
the fire marshal would probably

00:47:04.954 --> 00:47:05.579
shut this down.
 

00:47:05.579 --> 00:47:08.822
And what we can try to do
here--I think I have about a

00:47:08.822 --> 00:47:11.121
minute left--
is go back to the Cathedral of

00:47:11.121 --> 00:47:13.815
Chartres,
so let's--we have a slide here

00:47:13.815 --> 00:47:16.780
and it's a slide,
once again, of Bishop Fulbertus.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.802
He is the composer of the music
that you are about to hear,

00:47:20.802 --> 00:47:24.199
and again it's sung by a female
group, however.

00:47:24.199 --> 00:47:27.105
And as this music plays just
sit back and relax,

00:47:27.105 --> 00:47:30.195
pretend you area having a
transcendental experience

00:47:30.195 --> 00:47:31.000
yourself.
 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.583
Sit back, relax,
and look at some of this

00:47:34.583 --> 00:47:39.510
glorious stained glass and
architecture that has been in

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:43.989
this cathedral since the late
twelfth century.

00:47:43.989 --> 00:49:18.030
&gt;
 

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:20.329
So that's all for today.
 

00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:21.780
Ite--ite in pacem.
 

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:22.860
Pax vobiscum.
 

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.389
Congregatio missa est.
 

00:49:25.389 --> 00:49:29.789
I'll turn on the lights so we
don't kill ourselves .

00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:56.159
&gt;
 

00:49:56.159 --> 00:50:06.000

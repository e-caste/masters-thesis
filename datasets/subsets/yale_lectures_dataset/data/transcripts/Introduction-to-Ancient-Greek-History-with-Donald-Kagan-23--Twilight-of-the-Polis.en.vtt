00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.876
Professor Donald
Kagan: Let me remind you

00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:09.696
that the Spartans,
ever since their victory in the

00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:13.750
Peloponnesian War had been
attempting to extend their

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.671
hegemony,
at first all the way over into

00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:23.175
Asia, and then when that was
thwarted, they tried to do so on

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:28.450
the mainland of Greece,
and one consequence of their

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.024
effort and the failure to
achieve it in an easy way was

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:40.114
the restoration of Athens to a
primary position in the Greek

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:43.183
world.
Again, not as powerful as

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:47.126
Sparta, but once again an
independent state that was

00:00:47.126 --> 00:00:51.380
capable of being a serious
opponent of the Spartans.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.457
Today, I want to talk about the
emergence of a third great power

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:03.850
in this period which had never
had a position,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.862
I think, of something
resembling equality with the

00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:10.810
leading powers in the Greek
world,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.549
although it had had periods
when it was very strong anyway.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.189
Thebes is what I'm talking
about.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.626
Now, if you look at the
situation in 379,

00:01:22.626 --> 00:01:28.433
when the Spartans were in
control of Thebes as a

00:01:28.433 --> 00:01:33.870
consequence of the actions of
Phoebidas,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.991
there was a Spartan garrison
there in the city,

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:40.249
on its acropolis,
there were Spartan garrisons in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:44.185
other towns in Boeotia and it
was probably as a low a point

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:48.122
for the Thebans as they had
experienced since the 450s when

00:01:48.122 --> 00:01:51.379
the Athenians gained control of
Boeotia.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:56.101
But starting with the
successful Theban rebellion

00:01:56.101 --> 00:02:01.019
which overthrew the Spartan
command of the city,

00:02:01.019 --> 00:02:05.684
the Thebans launched a period
of growth in power,

00:02:05.684 --> 00:02:10.348
influence, wealth,
and even to some degree extent

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:15.402
which justifies modern
historians in speaking about a

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:22.009
period perhaps beginning in 371
and running at least a decade,

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.547
to which they give the name the
Theban Hegemony,

00:02:25.547 --> 00:02:29.911
and today I want to talk about
how that happened and how it

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:32.320
sort of developed and ended.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.963
The Spartans invaded,
after the Theban overthrow of

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:50.852
Spartan rule and in the first
year the leader in that invasion

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:55.099
was given to the young King
Cleombrotus,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.832
not to Agesilaus,
and his failure to undertake

00:02:58.832 --> 00:03:03.892
that command exercised the minds
of ancient writers as well as

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:07.379
modern ones.
One answer whenever Agesilaus

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.773
doesn't take command of an army,
which is following a policy

00:03:11.773 --> 00:03:15.731
that he likes,
people suggest that he might

00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:19.960
have been physically incapable
of doing it.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.186
He was an old man and he had
been injured and so that's a

00:03:25.186 --> 00:03:30.016
plausible reason at any time,
and yet the ancient writers

00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:34.463
were persuaded that there were
times when he was simply playing

00:03:34.463 --> 00:03:38.767
politics in some complicated way
and choosing not to take the

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:41.734
command.
This is one of those occasions

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:45.532
when they speculate that he was
trying to get Cleombrotus

00:03:45.532 --> 00:03:48.110
engaged in this anti-Theban
policy,

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.364
which would provide for greater
support for that general

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:57.004
Agesilean policy and that that's
why he had worked it so that

00:03:57.004 --> 00:04:01.707
Cleombrotus got the command.
We simply can't be sure

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:05.760
about what the truth of that is.
Cleombrotus,

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.972
however, did not wage a very
aggressive campaign and that

00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:17.740
first invasion of 378 produced
very, very little.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.346
However, subsequent Spartan
invasions also,

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:27.939
even those led by Agesilaus,
were not successful.

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.104
The Thebans were able gradually
to gather their strength,

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:36.790
to recover parts of Boeotia and
bring them under their power,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.227
and to drive the Spartans away
without yielding anything of

00:04:43.227 --> 00:04:48.957
importance.
One of the consequences--I'm

00:04:48.957 --> 00:04:57.839
talking really about the years
378,377, 376 and into 375.

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:00.431
One of the things that the
Thebans engaged in,

00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:02.705
in this period,
and it's extremely important

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.719
because it provides the basis
for the power that they will

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.785
develop,
was a reconstruction of the

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.906
Boeotian League.
The Thebans had commanded or

00:05:12.906 --> 00:05:17.269
led, or dominated the Boeotian
League before.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:21.968
They changed its constitution,
however, in these years in a

00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:27.590
way that was rather important.
In a word, to simply the

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:34.282
matter, the entire operation of
the league became more

00:05:34.282 --> 00:05:38.766
democratic.
They used to have the decisive

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:43.655
bodies that determined the
Theban policy in the form of

00:05:43.655 --> 00:05:48.372
four separate councils,
which were sort of indirect

00:05:48.372 --> 00:05:51.610
regimes that really made the
policy.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.646
The new constitution made the
decisive place really an

00:05:56.646 --> 00:06:01.777
assembly in which all the
representatives of the Theban

00:06:01.777 --> 00:06:07.194
cities came and made policy in
an assembly not in separate

00:06:07.194 --> 00:06:10.694
councils,
all of which could be more

00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:15.642
readily controlled by oligarchic
figures, and the only thing is

00:06:15.642 --> 00:06:19.872
that the meetings of the
Boeotian League took place in

00:06:19.872 --> 00:06:22.566
Thebes.
Now, not only did Thebes

00:06:22.566 --> 00:06:25.605
have a majority of
representatives in that league,

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:29.263
or at least the largest number
by virtue of its size and its

00:06:29.263 --> 00:06:32.482
leading role,
but the fact that it all took

00:06:32.482 --> 00:06:37.048
place in Thebes meant that there
would be more Thebans there and

00:06:37.048 --> 00:06:40.745
more Thebans playing an
influential role in what was

00:06:40.745 --> 00:06:42.795
going on.
Nonetheless,

00:06:42.795 --> 00:06:47.627
we shouldn't discount the truly
democratic nature of this

00:06:47.627 --> 00:06:49.699
regime.
It's a new thing.

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:55.147
Boeotia and Thebes used to be
bulwark of oligarchy,

00:06:55.147 --> 00:07:00.050
and it became a remarkably
democratic city,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.718
and I think there's reason to
take note of the fact that this

00:07:05.718 --> 00:07:11.670
seemed to have had an impact on
Thebes and Boeotia much like the

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.243
one that Herodotus praises so
highly back when Athens became

00:07:17.243 --> 00:07:20.717
democratic,
when they threw out their

00:07:20.717 --> 00:07:24.229
tyrants, and established the
Cleisthenic regime,

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.040
Herodotus says that they became
better warriors.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.293
They produced a better army;
they began defeating their

00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:33.420
enemies as they had not done
before.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.810
I think that is very
clearly also what happens in

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:40.788
Thebes.
We can't get away from the fact

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:44.367
that Thebes became a more
formidable military power

00:07:44.367 --> 00:07:47.068
thereafter.
Whether or not it's linked to

00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:50.406
democracy is open to argument,
but I think there is a real

00:07:50.406 --> 00:07:53.100
argument that would say it
worked that way.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.676
At least, we don't know the
details of this very well,

00:07:56.676 --> 00:08:00.050
but a very unusual thing seems
to have happened.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.851
The Thebans ultimately were
able to increase the size of

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:09.761
their army by using farmers,
who would not ordinarily have

00:08:09.761 --> 00:08:14.424
been able to afford hoplite
equipment, but somehow the state

00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:19.639
managed to equip poorer farmers
and to turn them into hoplites,

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:24.385
so that ultimately the army
that Thebes commanded--when you

00:08:24.385 --> 00:08:28.639
get down to the years after the
Battle of Leuctra,

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:33.482
in which the Thebans and their
friends defeated the Spartans,

00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:36.629
you will see that really a huge
army,

00:08:36.629 --> 00:08:40.212
by Greek standards,
goes marching into the

00:08:40.212 --> 00:08:45.454
Peloponnesus of which a large
portion was this Theban hoplite

00:08:45.454 --> 00:08:50.779
group that was much more potent,
because of its size and it

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:55.810
could be argued because of the
spirit of these newly hoplited

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.830
democrats,
you might say.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.076
Well, as the Thebans were
developing this league they were

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:07.253
also fighting the Spartans and
gradually driving the Spartans

00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:09.096
back.
For instance,

00:09:09.096 --> 00:09:14.522
they destroyed the city of
Plataea, which was always on the

00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:19.812
side of the enemies of Thebes.
In this case they were on the

00:09:19.812 --> 00:09:23.305
side of the Spartans,
and it would take a while

00:09:23.305 --> 00:09:28.119
before that was undone.
They also placed a number of

00:09:28.119 --> 00:09:32.917
cities under Theban command.
They didn't need to do that,

00:09:32.917 --> 00:09:36.432
for most of the cities in
Boeotia, because mostly they

00:09:36.432 --> 00:09:40.147
seemed to be satisfied and
pleased to cooperate with--and

00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:42.124
why not?
I mean, I should make the point

00:09:42.124 --> 00:09:43.850
clear as to why they would be
happy to do that.

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.105
When the Spartans invaded
Boeotia they didn't only beat up

00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:49.250
Thebes.
In fact, Thebes was less hurt

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.400
than were the other towns
because Thebes was further away

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.649
and better equipped to defend
itself.

00:09:54.649 --> 00:09:57.507
Every time the Spartans
came in they ravaged the

00:09:57.507 --> 00:10:00.870
Boeotian countryside and did
harm to these Boeotian towns.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.398
So, it was Thebes that was the
defender, the protector of the

00:10:04.398 --> 00:10:07.867
Boeotians against the Spartans,
and this certainly gave them

00:10:07.867 --> 00:10:11.436
popularity;
it helps explain why this new

00:10:11.436 --> 00:10:16.440
Boeotian confederation was so
effective and so loyal.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:20.398
The Thebans were doing a key
job for Boeotia and the

00:10:20.398 --> 00:10:21.330
Boeotians.

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:28.475
Meanwhile, this new army that
was being put together--it

00:10:28.475 --> 00:10:32.484
wasn't of course entirely new,
its heart would have been the

00:10:32.484 --> 00:10:36.562
old Boeotian hoplite farmer
group, but it was added to and

00:10:36.562 --> 00:10:41.473
it was given this new twist.
I think really a combination

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:46.476
twist of two kinds of elements
that explain a kind of

00:10:46.476 --> 00:10:51.480
enthusiasm, a kind of morale
boost that they had.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.399
One was a greater sense of
what we would call nationalism.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:58.515
It's obviously an anachronistic
for the city states but we don't

00:10:58.515 --> 00:11:01.113
have a better word for it.
That is to say,

00:11:01.113 --> 00:11:05.239
this constant warfare,
these constant attacks by the

00:11:05.239 --> 00:11:08.545
Spartans,
culminating in this seizure of

00:11:08.545 --> 00:11:13.138
their city against all custom,
against all law and in a very

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.985
unpleasant way,
and the support of these

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:19.600
oligarchs as against the common
people, the ordinary folks,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.301
so that when this new regime
led--I should point out by these

00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:27.200
two extraordinary military
leaders,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.547
Pelopidas and Epaminondas,
when these fellows also were

00:11:31.547 --> 00:11:35.009
responsible for the liberation
of Thebes,

00:11:35.009 --> 00:11:39.113
especially Pelopidas,
and when they were leading the

00:11:39.113 --> 00:11:41.929
fight for the defense of
Boeotia,

00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:45.981
all of that meant that there
was a growing feeling of "we are

00:11:45.981 --> 00:11:50.005
Boeotians, we are together,
and the enemy is the Spartans

00:11:50.005 --> 00:11:54.611
and we need to fight them."
To that, if you throw in the

00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:59.835
feeling that democracy appears
to have in its first burst

00:11:59.835 --> 00:12:05.524
especially--I should point out
that the Athenian extraordinary

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:11.027
success on land occurs right
after the democratic revolution

00:12:11.027 --> 00:12:15.035
of Cleisthenes.
I don't say they become bad

00:12:15.035 --> 00:12:18.758
thereafter but they're never
again quite as extraordinary as

00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:22.841
a land force as they are then.
An analogy that's often drawn

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:26.980
is with the armies of the French
Revolution in the eighteenth

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:30.237
century,
which really were fantastically

00:12:30.237 --> 00:12:34.828
successful right after the
revolution began and they began

00:12:34.828 --> 00:12:39.340
enrolling and de-conscripting
great numbers of people who

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.012
would never have been in the
army before in the name of the

00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:46.631
nation,
in the name of freedom,

00:12:46.631 --> 00:12:49.419
in the name of all kinds of
lovely things.

00:12:49.419 --> 00:12:53.128
Again, it's often neglected
that the French already had a

00:12:53.128 --> 00:12:56.837
terrific army before that
happened and they had wonderful

00:12:56.837 --> 00:13:00.205
officers and generals,
and were skilled in the art of

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:03.318
war.
So, it was a kind of a best of

00:13:03.318 --> 00:13:08.050
all worlds where they had a
solid base for military

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.022
superiority,
to which was added this great

00:13:12.022 --> 00:13:16.600
business of numbers and the zeal
that went with it.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.700
Something like that I
believe is going on here in the

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:24.875
370s to help explain what's
happening to what becomes this

00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:28.610
enormously powerful and
successful Theban army.

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.934
The fighting goes on.
The Thebans,

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:38.926
you remember,
joined with the Athenians

00:13:38.926 --> 00:13:43.728
against the Spartans back at the
time of the foundation of the

00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:48.372
Second Athenian Confederacy in
377 and they do work together

00:13:48.372 --> 00:13:52.126
for a time,
but it doesn't take very long

00:13:52.126 --> 00:13:57.042
for there to grow up differences
between the Athenians and the

00:13:57.042 --> 00:14:00.013
Boeotians.
They are, if you look back at

00:14:00.013 --> 00:14:03.063
the whole history,
more frequently enemies than

00:14:03.063 --> 00:14:05.992
they are friends.
There are longstanding

00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:09.997
differences, suspicions,
attitudes that are not entirely

00:14:09.997 --> 00:14:13.999
friendly and so on,
and as Theban power grows,

00:14:13.999 --> 00:14:19.627
and as the threat from Sparta
diminishes, the Athenians become

00:14:19.627 --> 00:14:24.610
less enthusiastic about their
alliance with Thebes,

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:28.524
because the Thebans are now
emerging as a contender for the

00:14:28.524 --> 00:14:32.169
leading position for a hegemonal
position in Greece.

00:14:32.169 --> 00:14:39.329
So, we will see the Athenians
and the Thebans gradually moving

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:46.523
apart in the decade of the 370s.
There was in 375 a proposal

00:14:46.523 --> 00:14:52.309
for peace to be established in
the warring Greek world.

00:14:52.309 --> 00:14:56.988
It was apparently--there's some
difference of opinion among our

00:14:56.988 --> 00:15:01.364
sources, but one thing that
seems clear, the King of Persia

00:15:01.364 --> 00:15:05.327
was in favor of it.
The ancient writers explain his

00:15:05.327 --> 00:15:09.064
reason for doing that,
for being interested in having

00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:12.730
that happen, because he had
other wars to fight.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:16.016
As to often was the case,
there was a rebellion in Egypt,

00:15:16.016 --> 00:15:18.129
which was always a serious
menace,

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:22.817
so he wanted peace so that he
could hire Greek mercenaries to

00:15:22.817 --> 00:15:26.283
fight in his army.
Perhaps that wasn't the only

00:15:26.283 --> 00:15:30.898
reason that the great king had.
He must have been worried at

00:15:30.898 --> 00:15:35.166
the growth of Athenian power and
influence at sea,

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:39.259
which was continuing throughout
this period.

00:15:39.259 --> 00:15:42.855
The Second Athenian Confederacy
never had the power and extent

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:45.980
that the great empire had had in
the fifth century,

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.198
but it was scary from the
standpoint of the great king and

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:54.046
so he might very well have
wanted to restore peace to

00:15:54.046 --> 00:15:58.413
Greece as a way of stopping
excuses for further expansion on

00:15:58.413 --> 00:16:02.409
the part of the Athenians.On
the other hand,

00:16:02.409 --> 00:16:06.431
the Athenians were not unhappy
to make peace as an opportunity

00:16:06.431 --> 00:16:10.254
to consolidate the gains that
they had had and because that

00:16:10.254 --> 00:16:14.540
would put a stop to what I think
was beginning to worry them,

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.818
the expansion of Thebes.
Now, mind you,

00:16:17.818 --> 00:16:21.629
they're still worried number
one about Sparta in 375.

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:24.429
Spartans haven't been defeated
by anybody;

00:16:24.429 --> 00:16:28.379
they're still the most serious
power, and they're still the

00:16:28.379 --> 00:16:32.259
power that stands for Persian
power in the Greek world,

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:36.163
but things have become more
complicated as Thebes has

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:40.362
emerged on the scene.
Well, the ancient writer,

00:16:40.362 --> 00:16:44.812
Diodorus especially,
speaks of an event--well,

00:16:44.812 --> 00:16:50.079
let me describe the event.
He says that when it was time

00:16:50.079 --> 00:16:55.290
to sign this common peace--maybe
I want to say a word about that

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.986
too.
The Greek words for common

00:16:57.986 --> 00:17:02.683
peace are koine eirene;
it is a term that comes up

00:17:02.683 --> 00:17:07.615
again and again in the fourth
century in attempting to bring

00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:11.210
peace agreements among the Greek
states.

00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:13.511
It's a new thing.
As you know,

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:18.078
peace in the past usually took
the form of the swearing of

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:22.886
oaths to accept a peace treaty
on very specific terms between

00:17:22.886 --> 00:17:27.530
combatants in that war.
The koine eirene concept

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:32.023
has a more modern ring to it,
and it seems to have the idea

00:17:32.023 --> 00:17:36.670
that there should be a common
peace among all the Greeks,

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:42.114
and that the signatories should
be responsible for upholding

00:17:42.114 --> 00:17:46.055
that common peace.
It's a very interesting idea

00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:50.769
and it sparked enormous interest
in scholars, I think especially

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:54.961
after the First World War,
when all of the hopeful talk

00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:59.149
about the League of Nations and
Kant's picture of perpetual

00:17:59.149 --> 00:18:03.121
peace and all of that stuff was
flying around in certain

00:18:03.121 --> 00:18:06.573
circles,
so people hoped to see in the

00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:10.213
koine eirene,
this might have been a

00:18:10.213 --> 00:18:14.200
preliminary sign of that same
kind of idea.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:19.839
But it didn't work any
better in the ancient world than

00:18:19.839 --> 00:18:23.339
it has worked in the modern
world.

00:18:23.339 --> 00:18:28.406
To get back to the first
suggestion in 375 about having

00:18:28.406 --> 00:18:32.253
such a thing,
the states were agreed to do

00:18:32.253 --> 00:18:35.447
it,
and then trouble came when

00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:41.694
Thebes insisted that just as the
Spartans could sign on behalf of

00:18:41.694 --> 00:18:46.769
all of their allies for the
Peloponnesian League,

00:18:46.769 --> 00:18:51.596
the Thebans wanted the right to
sign for all of their Boeotian

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:54.920
allies on behalf of the Boeotian
League.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.761
It would have been the de
facto recognition of the

00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:01.779
Boeotian League with Thebes as
its leader.

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:05.275
This is really what happened,
if you put your minds back to

00:19:05.275 --> 00:19:08.892
445 in the thirty-years peace
that concluded what we call the

00:19:08.892 --> 00:19:12.635
first Peloponnesian War.
When the Spartans allowed the

00:19:12.635 --> 00:19:17.099
Athenians to sign and speak for
all of the members of its league

00:19:17.099 --> 00:19:21.423
they were giving de facto
recognition and regarding the

00:19:21.423 --> 00:19:26.538
Athenians as their equals.
This was something that the

00:19:26.538 --> 00:19:32.700
Spartans no doubt led chiefly in
this view by Agesilaus;

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.720
they were not going to let the
Thebans do it.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:39.292
In fact,
we're told in a very bold

00:19:39.292 --> 00:19:44.410
action Agesilaus struck the
Thebans from the lists,

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.073
the list of those who would
take part in the peace because

00:19:49.073 --> 00:19:53.141
they insisted on this clause.
Now, there's a problem about

00:19:53.141 --> 00:19:55.726
this.
The same story almost

00:19:55.726 --> 00:20:01.742
identically is told in 371 when
we come to the attempt at

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:07.253
another koine eirenee,
to bring peace to the general

00:20:07.253 --> 00:20:11.759
Greek world, the whole story is
told in pretty much the same way

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:16.050
and the up shot of the one in
371 will be the Great Battle of

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.919
Leuctra.
This had led some scholars to

00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:21.526
say Diodorus,
who is the source of these

00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:24.869
tales, simply has screwed up,
has got it wrong;

00:20:24.869 --> 00:20:27.230
this is what they call a
doublet.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:32.338
Somehow he projected backwards
an event that really happened in

00:20:32.338 --> 00:20:35.619
371 and has it happen twice.
I'm very,

00:20:35.619 --> 00:20:39.291
very suspicious about modern
historians who are prepared rip

00:20:39.291 --> 00:20:42.912
up pieces of ancient historians,
because we know better and it

00:20:42.912 --> 00:20:45.150
just doesn't make any sense is
the argument.

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.997
The truth is,
I can see no reason why this

00:20:46.997 --> 00:20:50.777
shouldn't have happened twice.
Certainly, Epaminondas would

00:20:50.777 --> 00:20:54.950
have insisted on that,
certainly the Spartans would

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.995
have objected to it,
the actions that go with it

00:20:58.995 --> 00:21:03.640
strike me as being perfectly
okay in 375 and when four years

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.789
later a similar circumstance
emerges,

00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:08.970
why shouldn't the same thing
happen again?

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.879
I haven't really looked into
this, but I can imagine if you

00:21:11.879 --> 00:21:14.839
look through the whole Cold War
history I'm sure you'll find

00:21:14.839 --> 00:21:17.798
many of the things that are
happening over and over again in

00:21:17.798 --> 00:21:21.259
exactly the same way because the
circumstances haven't changed.

00:21:21.259 --> 00:21:25.579
So, with my characteristic
gullibility I believe in the

00:21:25.579 --> 00:21:30.172
story as it is told in 375.
Well, fighting resumes

00:21:30.172 --> 00:21:34.454
since the peace really didn't
hold and the Thebans

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:39.872
continue--and the Boeotians in
general continue to successfully

00:21:39.872 --> 00:21:44.470
fight off the Spartans.
I should have mentioned in the

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:47.767
course of this fighting,
soon after the treaty,

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:51.709
there's an amazing occasion
which has harbingers for the

00:21:51.709 --> 00:21:55.011
future.
A Spartan army is marching in

00:21:55.011 --> 00:21:58.547
one direction,
a Theban army is marching in

00:21:58.547 --> 00:22:02.251
another direction,
the Spartans outnumber the

00:22:02.251 --> 00:22:07.301
Thebans very greatly.
In fact, the whole Theban force

00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:12.931
is simply the 300 men who had
been formed pretty recently into

00:22:12.931 --> 00:22:18.099
a special elite fighting core
called the Sacred Band.

00:22:18.099 --> 00:22:23.007
Their special quality was that
in addition to be excellent

00:22:23.007 --> 00:22:27.140
warriors and trained especially
for their job,

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.498
they were homosexual lovers who
stood and fought right next to

00:22:32.498 --> 00:22:35.778
each other.
This was just carrying forward

00:22:35.778 --> 00:22:40.270
the principle that the Spartans
had used in one way and another,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:43.549
and it turned out to be equally
successful.

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:47.782
This Sacred Band was a
tremendous fighting force and

00:22:47.782 --> 00:22:52.630
will play a critical role in the
important Battle of Leuctra.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:57.232
Anyway, they managed to defeat
in a hoplite battle,

00:22:57.232 --> 00:23:01.650
a Spartan force that is greater
than they are.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.862
It's not a real hundred percent
hoplite battle,

00:23:04.862 --> 00:23:08.983
the numbers--there are only 300
Thebans, even though there's

00:23:08.983 --> 00:23:13.273
about 1,000 Spartans.
The way the battle is fought is

00:23:13.273 --> 00:23:17.129
not traditional,
typical, it's a little peculiar

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:21.559
so you really can't regard it as
the decisive time,

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:24.619
somebody beat a Spartan hoplite
phalanx in battle.

00:23:24.619 --> 00:23:26.859
That will have to wait until
Leuctra.

00:23:26.859 --> 00:23:29.899
On the other hand,
the evidence of the ancients is

00:23:29.899 --> 00:23:33.250
that it really impressed the
Greek world in general,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.856
and even this form of a victory
over Spartan hoplites,

00:23:36.856 --> 00:23:40.734
was unprecedented and it really
I think kind of shook some

00:23:40.734 --> 00:23:44.272
people in terms of their
confidence that the Spartans

00:23:44.272 --> 00:23:47.130
would always win a battle like
that.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.006
So, the fighting goes on,
on all the fronts that I have

00:23:52.006 --> 00:23:55.789
mentioned to you,
until finally we get down to

00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:59.319
371 and in 371 the same thing
happens.

00:23:59.319 --> 00:24:04.000
There is a pressure from the
Persians for a general peace,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.450
the Athenians are not against
that idea,

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:11.187
but the same tale I told you
last time, there's no question

00:24:11.187 --> 00:24:15.960
that it happened at Leuctra,
nobody doubts that and the

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:22.406
result was a renewal of the war
with the Spartans taking the

00:24:22.406 --> 00:24:25.888
lead,
aggressively moving into

00:24:25.888 --> 00:24:30.670
Boeotia as they had done every
time before.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:34.669
I think it's very worth
mentioning that we don't have

00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:37.130
any case up to now,
up to 371,

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.959
in which the Boeotians and
their friends and allies march

00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:44.896
into the Peloponnesus.
All the attacking has been by

00:24:44.896 --> 00:24:49.092
the Spartans into Boeotia,
which means these wars have

00:24:49.092 --> 00:24:53.130
always been costly to Boeotia
but not to Sparta,

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:58.534
and we'll see that one of the
things that Epaminondas wants to

00:24:58.534 --> 00:25:02.609
do when he can is to reverse
that situation.

00:25:02.609 --> 00:25:07.990
So, this brings us to the
Battle of Leuctra;

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:13.119
Leuctra is a town in
southwestern Boeotia.

00:25:13.119 --> 00:25:18.210
The two armies march towards
each other;

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:21.297
there's a lot of maneuvering
this way and that way,

00:25:21.297 --> 00:25:24.569
but finally they come onto this
rather small field.

00:25:24.569 --> 00:25:28.069
You can go there today and look
at it;

00:25:28.069 --> 00:25:34.401
it really is pretty easy to
place the ancient story into the

00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:38.836
modern geography.
There's a plain between two

00:25:38.836 --> 00:25:42.920
hills, one to the south and one
to the north.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.684
Boeotian army took up its
position on the northern hill,

00:25:46.684 --> 00:25:50.450
and the Spartans took up theirs
on the southern hill,

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.087
and then finally when the
daylight came they move forward

00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:59.808
and fought each other in this
field which is sort of--it's

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:04.860
plenty big enough for any kind
of hoplite battle that you want

00:26:04.860 --> 00:26:08.097
to have.
Some scholars have wanted to

00:26:08.097 --> 00:26:12.475
make the battle in terms of a
limited space but I think that

00:26:12.475 --> 00:26:16.782
really isn't an issue.
This is a sort of a typical

00:26:16.782 --> 00:26:21.516
hoplite battlefield.
So, Cleombrotus marches on

00:26:21.516 --> 00:26:24.626
Thebes, again,
it's not Agesilaus,

00:26:24.626 --> 00:26:29.808
and I mean this looks like the
culmination of Agesilaus'

00:26:29.808 --> 00:26:33.500
anti-Theban policy;
he's not there.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.768
Again, the ancient writers and
modern scholars wonder why he

00:26:36.768 --> 00:26:38.958
wasn't there.
I'm prepared to take the

00:26:38.958 --> 00:26:41.146
simple-minded view;
if he wasn't there,

00:26:41.146 --> 00:26:44.655
he couldn't have been there.
He must have been out of action

00:26:44.655 --> 00:26:47.591
for physical reasons,
because I can't imagine any

00:26:47.591 --> 00:26:51.750
good reason why he wouldn't want
to be there for the payoff here.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:57.134
Anyway, there was something in
the neighborhood of 10,000

00:26:57.134 --> 00:27:03.288
Spartan hoplites and maybe 1,000
cavalry and the Boeotian side is

00:27:03.288 --> 00:27:08.769
less clear maybe 6,000 maybe
7,000 Boeotian hoplites.

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:14.073
So, they are outnumbered and I
think that has a lot to do with

00:27:14.073 --> 00:27:19.550
the tactics that Epaminondas
employs in fighting this battle.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.000
It's a famous battle;
it's an important battle.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.350
So, I'll take a few moments to
talk about the battle itself.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:33.857
Again, this is much debated;
it's not easy to know what's

00:27:33.857 --> 00:27:38.953
going on or why it's going on.
Let's start with the important

00:27:38.953 --> 00:27:41.609
point that the Thebans were
outnumbered.

00:27:41.609 --> 00:27:47.514
So, it really was up to
Epaminondas to think of some way

00:27:47.514 --> 00:27:53.195
to overcome this disadvantage.
Normal course of events 6,000

00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:57.377
or 7,000 against 10,000 in a
regular hoplite battle you

00:27:57.377 --> 00:28:01.559
can--the bookies would take the
game off the board.

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:05.380
I mean, especially if they're
Spartans and Peloponnesians.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.740
The bigger battalions are going
to win.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.845
So Epaminondas comes up with
certainly--nobody can deny that

00:28:13.845 --> 00:28:16.350
he came up with some kind of
plan.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.275
What am I fussing about here?
Some scholars have wanted

00:28:20.275 --> 00:28:25.406
to emphasize not the tactics of
Epaminondas, but rather the

00:28:25.406 --> 00:28:29.830
superior fighting qualities of
this new Theban,

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:34.849
democratic, national army.
Well, I certainly think that

00:28:34.849 --> 00:28:37.746
made a difference.
I give real credit to that

00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:41.839
element and yet I can't escape
thinking that there really was a

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:45.583
very tricky,
unusual, strategy of tactics or

00:28:45.583 --> 00:28:50.379
operational plan used by
Epaminondas that accounts in a

00:28:50.379 --> 00:28:55.264
considerable part for the
success of the Thebans in this

00:28:55.264 --> 00:28:58.217
battle.
The normal way you line up

00:28:58.217 --> 00:29:02.574
is--sort of the leading forces
on each side take up the right

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.221
wing of their phalanx.
That's the position of honor

00:29:06.221 --> 00:29:09.359
and that's where you try to beat
the other guy.

00:29:09.359 --> 00:29:12.461
That has the consequence
incidentally of meaning that the

00:29:12.461 --> 00:29:15.119
best army doesn't fight against
the best army.

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:17.729
In each case,
the best army is fighting

00:29:17.729 --> 00:29:20.819
against a weaker portion of the
enemy army.

00:29:20.819 --> 00:29:23.420
That's not what Epaminondas
wanted.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:30.254
He put his Theban forces with
the 300 Sacred Band members at

00:29:30.254 --> 00:29:35.417
the front of it;
his own group was at the left

00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:41.359
side of the Boeotian line facing
the Spartans directly.

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:47.139
Now, the Spartans had to
realize when they saw what was

00:29:47.139 --> 00:29:52.384
going on--forgive me,
I forgot to tell you another

00:29:52.384 --> 00:29:58.415
very important thing.
Instead of the usual depth of

00:29:58.415 --> 00:30:03.738
the phalanx eight,
twelve, maybe sixteen ranks,

00:30:03.738 --> 00:30:09.640
Epaminondas loaded his left
wing fifty men deep.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.912
It may be precedented,
but if so it's extremely rare

00:30:14.912 --> 00:30:20.016
in the past.
Then when he started for battle

00:30:20.016 --> 00:30:26.856
he took his left wing and moved
it obliquely further to the

00:30:26.856 --> 00:30:30.459
left.
The plan being to flank the

00:30:30.459 --> 00:30:35.482
Spartans, if they could,
and come at them from their

00:30:35.482 --> 00:30:40.900
vulnerable side and to do so in
tremendous strength.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:46.545
I think the idea of the
tremendous strength and depth

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:51.787
was to win on that side quickly,
because he was weak,

00:30:51.787 --> 00:30:56.677
obviously, on his right.
I suppose that the force

00:30:56.677 --> 00:31:02.019
immediately after the Thebans
would itself present a problem,

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:05.546
because if the Thebans went
sharply to the left on this

00:31:05.546 --> 00:31:08.420
occasion with their deep
powerful phalanx,

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.677
the guys next to them probably
would move with them to some

00:31:12.677 --> 00:31:16.788
degree, but not with the same
speed and not with the same

00:31:16.788 --> 00:31:19.747
determination,
because the situation--so there

00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:22.600
was the danger of there being an
opening right there;

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.782
that would have been very scary.
Apparently, Epaminondas told

00:31:26.782 --> 00:31:32.190
the people on the right--I would
have thought everybody to the

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:36.799
right of his outfit,
to proceed only very slowly.

00:31:36.799 --> 00:31:41.785
If that's the case,
the Peloponnesian army on their

00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:48.166
left would have had to take some
time before they could encounter

00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:52.940
the Boeotian army.
So, the first fighting would be

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:58.018
on the left, where Epaminondas
wanted it and his hope was in a

00:31:58.018 --> 00:32:02.180
way this is a variety of the
Marathon strategy.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.922
You remember the big thing
there was the Athenians under

00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:09.538
Miltiades hoped to win swiftly
on the wings where they had

00:32:09.538 --> 00:32:11.932
greater depth.
They knew they would lose in

00:32:11.932 --> 00:32:14.169
the middle, they just hoped they
would lose slower,

00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:15.779
than they would win on the
wings.

00:32:15.779 --> 00:32:19.140
I think this is a version of
the same idea.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:25.289
So, Epaminondas and his block
of Thebans goes to the left,

00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:31.440
and I would argue and the
ancient sources say this too,

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:37.380
swiftly as Herodotus said of
the Athenians at Marathon,

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.460
dromoi,
on the run.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.773
Well, I guess that means on the
trot, and so they wanted to get

00:32:44.773 --> 00:32:49.086
that fight going as fast as they
could and to win it as fast as

00:32:49.086 --> 00:32:51.950
they could.
Well, that's the essential

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:55.869
idea, that they would win
powerfully on the left and send

00:32:55.869 --> 00:32:59.650
the Spartans into route and
thereby destroy their whole

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:03.504
campaign.
Now, we have to account for

00:33:03.504 --> 00:33:08.720
funny things that happen apart
from the phalanx.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.849
Before the battle is over,
both sides take their cavalry

00:33:13.849 --> 00:33:17.240
from the usual position on the
wings,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.006
on the flanks of the phalanx,
meant either to protect your

00:33:22.006 --> 00:33:26.941
wings or to assault the enemy on
his wing and move it to the

00:33:26.941 --> 00:33:31.289
center of the battlefield where
it plays a role,

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:33.988
and so the question always is
what are they doing,

00:33:33.988 --> 00:33:37.799
what's this all about?
I think one can only speculate.

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:42.710
Surely, it would have been a
wise thing for Epaminondas to

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:47.878
move his cavalry into the center
of the field in front of the

00:33:47.878 --> 00:33:51.703
center of his line,
not in front of him but in

00:33:51.703 --> 00:33:56.098
front of the guys to his right,
because they too would have had

00:33:56.098 --> 00:34:00.423
an effect of slowing down any
Spartan attack where there was a

00:34:00.423 --> 00:34:04.020
vulnerability.
So, if you take it from that

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:07.395
point of view you could think
the Spartans,

00:34:07.395 --> 00:34:11.655
who definitely moved their
cavalry out front did so in

00:34:11.655 --> 00:34:14.869
order to combat the Theban
cavalry.

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:17.164
That would be an
explanation enough,

00:34:17.164 --> 00:34:20.166
but some scholars make an
argument, and there's some

00:34:20.166 --> 00:34:22.519
reason to think they might be
right,

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:28.556
that the Spartans seeing what
Epaminondas was doing knew that

00:34:28.556 --> 00:34:34.191
he was trying to flank them on
the right side and so they

00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:40.530
wanted to take steps to prevent
being flanked on that side,

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.718
and so they did something which
they tried to do at the Battle

00:34:43.718 --> 00:34:46.503
of Mantinea,
but it didn't happen for them,

00:34:46.503 --> 00:34:50.199
they pulled troops out from the
center of their line,

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:54.826
sent them around behind the
phalanx, and put them out on the

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:59.059
right wing to prevent exactly
that kind of an event.

00:34:59.059 --> 00:35:04.658
But to prevent the Boeotians
from charging that empty spot

00:35:04.658 --> 00:35:08.863
until it was filled,
they sent their cavalry up

00:35:08.863 --> 00:35:12.872
front to shield them,
not only to shield them but in

00:35:12.872 --> 00:35:16.270
effect to hide them.
Certainly, the cavalries being

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:18.710
out there would have kicked up a
lot of dust,

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:22.797
and they could have hoped that
the Thebans wouldn't know what

00:35:22.797 --> 00:35:25.760
was going on.
So, that's the theory.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:31.960
What is a fact is that the
Boeotian cavalry and the Spartan

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:35.882
cavalry clashed,
and as I think again the

00:35:35.882 --> 00:35:40.570
bookies if this had happened,
would have predicted the

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.019
Thebans defeated the
Peloponnesians.

00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:47.079
The Thebans had a superior
cavalry.

00:35:47.079 --> 00:35:50.662
It had to do,
of course, with the nature of

00:35:50.662 --> 00:35:55.354
their land which is better for
horses than most of Greek

00:35:55.354 --> 00:36:00.302
country and so they drove the
cavalry back into the Spartan

00:36:00.302 --> 00:36:05.165
phalanx helping to create
confusion and to break ranks and

00:36:05.165 --> 00:36:09.179
all that kind of stuff.
But the real payoff,

00:36:09.179 --> 00:36:13.355
the real victory in the battle
was one where Epaminondas hoped

00:36:13.355 --> 00:36:17.599
it would be, on his left flank,
on the Spartan right flank.

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:23.231
I don't think it's an accident
that the Theban phalanx came

00:36:23.231 --> 00:36:28.572
swiftly to the place where the
Spartan king was located,

00:36:28.572 --> 00:36:31.679
Cleombrotus,
and killed him.

00:36:31.679 --> 00:36:35.493
If you look at Greek
battles throughout all of their

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:39.929
history, killing the general in
command is a really good idea,

00:36:39.929 --> 00:36:42.989
because when you do that you
usually win.

00:36:42.989 --> 00:36:49.039
Have you got numbers Curtis on
that or just got a general idea?

00:36:49.039 --> 00:36:54.420
Of how often that is a decisive
or an important element?

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:57.951
Very frequent, isn't it?
When you kill the general you

00:36:57.951 --> 00:36:59.444
win;
Curtis knows more about

00:36:59.444 --> 00:37:02.020
military history in the Greek
world than anybody.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:08.368
So, I have to consult him.
So that being the case,

00:37:08.368 --> 00:37:14.467
the Spartans fought bravely and
strongly around the body of

00:37:14.467 --> 00:37:18.428
their king,
but that only led more of them

00:37:18.428 --> 00:37:23.240
to be killed and before very
long the Spartan phalanx broke

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:28.657
and ran and the Thebans,
the Boeotians had won a clear

00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:33.477
cut unmistakable,
blatant victory in a normal

00:37:33.477 --> 00:37:37.052
hoplite battle,
on a normal field,

00:37:37.052 --> 00:37:42.215
and this was the shock felt
round the Greek world that this

00:37:42.215 --> 00:37:45.340
had happened,
just changed everything.

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:48.706
Here's an interesting fact
that tells you something else

00:37:48.706 --> 00:37:52.130
that's important about what's
going on in the Greek world.

00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:59.753
There were only perhaps 700
Spartiates in the whole battle

00:37:59.753 --> 00:38:06.610
and of these 400 were killed.
Think about that;

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:09.930
I mean, that's devastating in
so many ways.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:16.677
It had all kinds of effects.
We shall see it immediately

00:38:16.677 --> 00:38:20.014
shook the control of the
Spartans, even over the

00:38:20.014 --> 00:38:22.788
Peloponnesus.
It made people think the

00:38:22.788 --> 00:38:26.883
Spartans were vulnerable and
that they might have come to the

00:38:26.883 --> 00:38:30.635
end of the line,
but another interesting

00:38:30.635 --> 00:38:37.039
contrary consequence was that
suddenly Sparta wasn't scary,

00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:42.167
but Thebes was very scary,
and the Athenians who had

00:38:42.167 --> 00:38:48.299
already come to be nervous about
the Thebans--notice I haven't

00:38:48.299 --> 00:38:52.400
mentioned them.
They had been the allies of

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:55.273
Thebes;
they were not at the Battle of

00:38:55.273 --> 00:38:57.363
Leuctra.
As a matter of fact,

00:38:57.363 --> 00:39:01.562
they were clearly working with
the Spartans already to check

00:39:01.562 --> 00:39:05.334
Theban power and Theban
expansion before the Battle of

00:39:05.334 --> 00:39:07.869
Leuctra.
They stayed neutral;

00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:10.720
they didn't show up at the
battle at all,

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:14.568
but it tells you a very
important change in the seam in

00:39:14.568 --> 00:39:20.296
the Greek world at this time.
So, I think it's safe to

00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:27.409
say the Battle of Leuctra put an
end to Spartan supremacy.

00:39:27.409 --> 00:39:33.730
The Spartan hegemony is over
and now the question that awaits

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:39.369
Greece is what happens next.
I think in the normal course of

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:43.289
events prior to the build up of
this new Thebes,

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:47.349
there would have been a
division of power between the

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:51.409
states, the Athenians would have
used some muscle,

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:55.219
the Thebans would have used
some muscle, some lesser states

00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:59.226
would have emerged in the vacuum
created by the destruction of

00:39:59.226 --> 00:40:02.380
Spartan power but that would
have been that.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:08.143
However, given all that had had
happened in Boeotia and the kind

00:40:08.143 --> 00:40:13.540
of leadership that existed in
Thebes, something amazing then

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.143
happened;
the Thebans decided to put an

00:40:17.143 --> 00:40:22.135
end to Spartan power forever and
took a number of measures to

00:40:22.135 --> 00:40:25.766
bring that about.
Just the defeat of Leuctra

00:40:25.766 --> 00:40:29.849
meant the disintegration of the
Peloponnesian League.

00:40:29.849 --> 00:40:33.479
A number of states
obviously took advantage of

00:40:33.479 --> 00:40:37.628
Sparta's weakness to just pull
out and get out from under

00:40:37.628 --> 00:40:41.975
Spartan control.
Then in the year 370,

00:40:41.975 --> 00:40:49.615
the Thebans put together a
tremendous army and ultimately

00:40:49.615 --> 00:40:58.619
marched into the Peloponnesus to
do what they were going to do.

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:05.169
One of the things that happened
reflecting the collapse of the

00:41:05.169 --> 00:41:10.966
Spartan hegemony in the
Peloponnesus was that the towns

00:41:10.966 --> 00:41:17.223
in the region of Arcadia,
the mountainous region to the

00:41:17.223 --> 00:41:22.209
north of Sparta,
put themselves together in the

00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:27.664
form of the Arcadian League.
I mentioned this to your

00:41:27.664 --> 00:41:31.439
earlier, I believe;
it is one of the first federal

00:41:31.439 --> 00:41:35.700
leagues of a different kind from
the one we've seen up to now.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:40.559
There is no hegemonal state.
It is not some big state and

00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:45.171
its friends, which even the
Boeotian League is still in that

00:41:45.171 --> 00:41:47.464
category.
It is, in fact,

00:41:47.464 --> 00:41:51.671
a collection of states that are
ostensibly equal and this is

00:41:51.671 --> 00:41:55.022
entirely voluntary.
They are coming together,

00:41:55.022 --> 00:41:58.729
these Arcadian states,
in order to protect themselves

00:41:58.729 --> 00:42:02.578
and to pursue their interests
against the many troubles

00:42:02.578 --> 00:42:04.860
they've had over the years.

00:42:09.019 --> 00:42:12.406
The question always is
then--this is both evidence of

00:42:12.406 --> 00:42:16.054
what I'm saying that it was a
new kind of a league and it

00:42:16.054 --> 00:42:20.027
reveals the fact that there was
no state that was sufficiently

00:42:20.027 --> 00:42:23.740
superior to the others that
could make it obvious that the

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.517
capital so to speak of this new
confederation would be that

00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:32.599
state.
They built a brand new city.

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:36.469
It was called,
I love it, Megalopolis.

00:42:36.469 --> 00:42:40.400
That means it ran from
Washington to Boston.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.403
No I'm sorry.
It meant, of course,

00:42:43.403 --> 00:42:46.590
big polis,
big city, big state,

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:50.793
whatever you want.
But it was the place where the

00:42:50.793 --> 00:42:53.585
league council met,
state sent their

00:42:53.585 --> 00:42:57.592
representatives to it,
their business was done there,

00:42:57.592 --> 00:43:00.409
and it's really quite an
interesting event,

00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:04.500
especially as you look ahead in
the history of Greece and as I

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.915
told you last time,
that kind of thing had the

00:43:07.915 --> 00:43:11.873
remarkable influence on the
thinking of the shapers of the

00:43:11.873 --> 00:43:16.108
American Constitution.
The Athenians' attitude

00:43:16.108 --> 00:43:22.032
towards this--we think about all
this long rivalry between Sparta

00:43:22.032 --> 00:43:26.659
and Athens that resulted in such
terrible wars,

00:43:26.659 --> 00:43:31.363
it just goes to show you--what
was it--Palmesrton in the

00:43:31.363 --> 00:43:35.288
nineteenth century,
British statesman,

00:43:35.288 --> 00:43:40.608
I think he once said,
Britain has no permanent

00:43:40.608 --> 00:43:45.200
friends or enemies,
only permanent interests.

00:43:48.909 --> 00:43:52.542
I think whether that was true
of Britain or not at the time,

00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:55.991
I think we should always
realize that that is true of the

00:43:55.991 --> 00:43:59.070
way states operate in an
international system.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.876
It is not that they don't have
inclinations and longstanding

00:44:02.876 --> 00:44:07.454
friendships do have some impact,
and longstanding enmities have

00:44:07.454 --> 00:44:11.110
a greater impact and yet
anything can happen.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:18.025
I mean, just to get some sense
of that who would have believed

00:44:18.025 --> 00:44:24.487
that in the 1930s that Great
Britain and France would join

00:44:24.487 --> 00:44:31.630
with Joseph Stalin's Soviet
Union for any purpose whatever,

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.212
since they, especially the
British, had been interested in

00:44:35.212 --> 00:44:38.732
putting an end to that regime
from the moment that it was

00:44:38.732 --> 00:44:41.492
invented,
and that Winston Churchill

00:44:41.492 --> 00:44:46.050
would be the greatest advocate
of this alliance with Stalin.

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:48.125
Winston Churchill,
who I tell you,

00:44:48.125 --> 00:44:51.835
had been a leading figure in
having an invasion of Russia in

00:44:51.835 --> 00:44:55.420
1920-21, in order to bring down
the Bolshevik Regime.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.952
Churchill's answer,
I think, to the question of why

00:44:58.952 --> 00:45:01.829
you're doing this,
tells you a lot about this

00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:04.250
general point I'm trying to
make.

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.079
I'm not going to get this
exactly right;

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:09.010
I don't have Churchill's gift
and my memory is fading.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:12.851
He said, you know,
why are you joining up with

00:45:12.851 --> 00:45:15.239
Stalin?
You've been denouncing him

00:45:15.239 --> 00:45:18.550
forever.
He said, if the devil--no I'm

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:24.430
sorry, if Hitler invaded hell at
the very least I would want to

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:30.500
say a few kind words about the
devil in the House of Commons.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.462
That ought to tell you
something about the permanence

00:45:34.462 --> 00:45:39.837
of these kinds of things.
Interests are what matter and

00:45:39.837 --> 00:45:44.070
the Athenian interests have
changed.

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:49.762
Thebes was becoming a challenge
to the Athenian growth and

00:45:49.762 --> 00:45:53.861
influence in power,
and they did not want the

00:45:53.861 --> 00:45:58.824
Thebans now to destroy Sparta's
control of the Peloponnesus and

00:45:58.824 --> 00:46:03.306
replaced it with a Theban
control of the Peloponnesus and

00:46:03.306 --> 00:46:07.389
that accounts both for why
Athens is not helping the

00:46:07.389 --> 00:46:10.043
Thebans,
but also in fact,

00:46:10.043 --> 00:46:15.171
intriguing with states in the
Peloponnesus to try to stand up

00:46:15.171 --> 00:46:18.949
to the Thebans,
rather than to do what might

00:46:18.949 --> 00:46:21.808
seem obvious.
Now, the Thebans were

00:46:21.808 --> 00:46:26.190
continuing--I'll come back to
their invasion in just a moment.

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:32.876
They were continuing to grow,
they were gaining allies in

00:46:32.876 --> 00:46:36.577
central Greece,
Phocis, Aetolia,

00:46:36.577 --> 00:46:40.159
Acarnania, Locris,
Euboea.

00:46:40.159 --> 00:46:43.518
Here again, I'm going to be
teaching you general truths

00:46:43.518 --> 00:46:47.124
about international relations
that don't seem to be part of

00:46:47.124 --> 00:46:49.550
the ordinary education and that
is,

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:54.739
power has a fantastically
attractive quality.

00:46:54.739 --> 00:46:58.496
When a state is suddenly
enormously powerful--I think the

00:46:58.496 --> 00:47:02.453
political scientists' rules and
I admit what I just said has

00:47:02.453 --> 00:47:06.210
been known and been said by many
of them many times,

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:08.737
but the favorite thing is if
there's a great power what

00:47:08.737 --> 00:47:11.589
happens next?
What happens is all the other

00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:16.110
states get together and join up
to control that power to which

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.495
the answer is "sometimes."
A lot of times,

00:47:19.495 --> 00:47:23.943
and they have another term to
consider the alternative,

00:47:23.943 --> 00:47:28.885
which they call bandwagoning
and that is states are attracted

00:47:28.885 --> 00:47:32.591
by that power,
want to get on the right side

00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:35.398
of that power,
join up with that power,

00:47:35.398 --> 00:47:39.829
and that's what happened here
where suddenly the Theban power

00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:44.113
in that area seemed so strong
that you wanted to be on that

00:47:44.113 --> 00:47:46.673
side.
I'm just in this terrible

00:47:46.673 --> 00:47:50.252
analogizing mood today so please
forgive me, but lest you think

00:47:50.252 --> 00:47:53.196
the study of ancient history is
not relevant to your

00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:55.389
understanding of the world
today,

00:47:55.389 --> 00:47:59.015
and I know none of you would be
so foolish as to think that,

00:47:59.015 --> 00:48:02.579
let me just look at what's
happening in the Middle East.

00:48:02.579 --> 00:48:04.656
And I'll say it before it's
common wisdom,

00:48:04.656 --> 00:48:06.480
so that you'll see how smart I
am.

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.317
Syria, which has been nothing
but trouble for our side all

00:48:15.317 --> 00:48:19.660
this time, all of a sudden seems
to be behaving in a different

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:22.365
way,
and even the United States

00:48:22.365 --> 00:48:27.456
government says that the Syrians
seem not to be feeding more Al

00:48:27.456 --> 00:48:31.070
Qaeda people across the border
into Iraq.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.000
Why is that?
What have they found religion?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.133
I guess they had religion
already, but the answer is

00:48:38.133 --> 00:48:42.914
because suddenly the American
forces are kicking hell out of

00:48:42.914 --> 00:48:47.939
everybody in Iraq and suddenly
there's a powerful American army

00:48:47.939 --> 00:48:52.299
sitting there,
which is right next door to

00:48:52.299 --> 00:48:54.500
Syria.
It's also right next door to

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.317
Iran.
That should have interesting

00:48:56.317 --> 00:48:59.353
consequences too;
the result is that the Syrians

00:48:59.353 --> 00:49:02.050
are suddenly talking very
differently.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.740
Now, that doesn't mean that
there'll be a permanent change;

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:10.173
that will depend upon realities.
But you get fed so much gunk in

00:49:10.173 --> 00:49:14.161
a different direction.
The most important single

00:49:14.161 --> 00:49:17.642
element in international
relations, not the only one by

00:49:17.642 --> 00:49:21.003
any means,
but the most important one is

00:49:21.003 --> 00:49:25.179
power and the perception of
where the power is,

00:49:25.179 --> 00:49:29.199
and the perception of whether
that power is growing or

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:31.921
shrinking.
Nothing is as important as

00:49:31.921 --> 00:49:35.406
that, everything else
contributes, but doesn't have

00:49:35.406 --> 00:49:38.965
that central role.
Well, that's the situation that

00:49:38.965 --> 00:49:42.886
the Thebans have created with
their victory and so they are

00:49:42.886 --> 00:49:47.274
expanding all over the place.
Thebans were great landlubbers,

00:49:47.274 --> 00:49:51.365
they're even building a navy,
they are moving out into the

00:49:51.365 --> 00:49:54.638
Aegean Sea,
and that's one of the things

00:49:54.638 --> 00:49:58.365
that has created this
nervousness in Athens and

00:49:58.365 --> 00:50:04.857
explains the Athenian behavior.
Now comes this great

00:50:04.857 --> 00:50:14.352
invasion over the year 370,369.
The total force of hoplites in

00:50:14.352 --> 00:50:22.325
the army put together by
Epaminondas is reported to be

00:50:22.325 --> 00:50:26.588
40,000.
Now, there's just not a number

00:50:26.588 --> 00:50:31.644
like that in the whole fifth
century, or any time before

00:50:31.644 --> 00:50:34.924
this.
It's just an amazing army and

00:50:34.924 --> 00:50:39.836
we are told there were some
30,000 others on the campaign

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:43.538
who were not hoplites,
maybe many of them weren't even

00:50:43.538 --> 00:50:46.070
fighters but a lot of them would
have been cavalry,

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:50.028
light arm infantry and so on.
But in any case,

00:50:50.028 --> 00:50:55.741
here are 70,000 people meaning
no good to the Spartans pouring

00:50:55.741 --> 00:50:59.300
into the Peloponnesus in that
year.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.849
It is the largest military
force reported in Greek history.

00:51:03.849 --> 00:51:09.362
The men in charge are these
two extraordinary men,

00:51:09.362 --> 00:51:14.250
Epaminondas and Pelopidas,
who repeatedly proved

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:17.902
themselves.
By the way, it was Pelopidas

00:51:17.902 --> 00:51:22.387
who won that victory in 375 at
Tegyra, you remember that with

00:51:22.387 --> 00:51:25.522
the 300.
So, he has that great victory

00:51:25.522 --> 00:51:30.308
on his record and Epaminondas,
of course, is the architect of

00:51:30.308 --> 00:51:35.252
the victory at Leuctra and they
just are amazing and remarkable

00:51:35.252 --> 00:51:38.416
people.
If you read some of those--we

00:51:38.416 --> 00:51:41.991
do not have a Plutarch biography
of Epaminondas,

00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:46.099
although he does give us a
Pelopidas, we're happy about

00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:49.166
that.
But before I get through I will

00:51:49.166 --> 00:51:53.929
try to remedy that as I tried to
do in the case of Thrasybulus by

00:51:53.929 --> 00:51:58.171
bringing to your attention how
great was the reputation of

00:51:58.171 --> 00:52:03.130
Epaminondas in the Greek world;
maybe I should just say a word

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:07.625
about him now.
He is reputed to have been

00:52:07.625 --> 00:52:13.097
a person of great intellect.
Apparently, he was a

00:52:13.097 --> 00:52:19.335
philosopher and took that
seriously and was regarded with

00:52:19.335 --> 00:52:24.570
respect by others of that ilk in
that world.

00:52:24.570 --> 00:52:30.037
Of course, it looks very much
as though he is a man of

00:52:30.037 --> 00:52:35.813
political convictions of such a
kind as almost to suggest

00:52:35.813 --> 00:52:40.401
political theory.
I mean, he seems to have been

00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:44.744
committed to the idea of
democracy as a good thing in

00:52:44.744 --> 00:52:47.588
itself.
On this latter point we just

00:52:47.588 --> 00:52:51.389
don't have very much evidence,
nothing that he said,

00:52:51.389 --> 00:52:55.973
but we do have what he did
which squares perfectly with

00:52:55.973 --> 00:53:00.184
what we are talking about.
It would be--I mean it breaks

00:53:00.184 --> 00:53:03.409
my heart--these lives that
Plutarch did not write.

00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:08.109
What I would give for a life of
Cleisthenes by Plutarch,

00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:12.040
and similarly of Epaminondas
and I'm amazed.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.645
I don't know.
Who knows why Plutarch did what

00:53:14.645 --> 00:53:16.876
he did.
But in any case it would be

00:53:16.876 --> 00:53:20.837
really fascinating in his case,
because of the complicated

00:53:20.837 --> 00:53:25.295
nature of his mind and his life,
but there he is along with

00:53:25.295 --> 00:53:28.800
Pelopidas leaving this armed
force in there.

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:34.988
They move down into
Laconia, the home territory of

00:53:34.988 --> 00:53:39.526
the Spartans.
Now, the Spartans are forced to

00:53:39.526 --> 00:53:45.190
huddle in their city and to try
to resist anything that comes at

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:48.294
them.
They cannot go out to fight

00:53:48.294 --> 00:53:51.650
these people invading their
homeland.

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:55.300
Their homeland has never been
invaded in anybody's memory.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:58.995
This is out of the question,
nothing like this would have

00:53:58.995 --> 00:54:01.832
been possible,
and here they are just hiding

00:54:01.832 --> 00:54:04.267
in their city.
Not even a walled city,

00:54:04.267 --> 00:54:07.360
because it was part of their
pride, they don't need walls,

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.103
they have an army.
Nobody can come in there and

00:54:10.103 --> 00:54:12.280
attack their city and there they
are.

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:16.796
What does Epaminondas do?
He does not go after them in

00:54:16.796 --> 00:54:22.640
that city, because probably--one
reason would have been--fighting

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:26.170
in the city,
urban warfare is always

00:54:26.170 --> 00:54:30.396
difficult and costly,
and nobody until lately,

00:54:30.396 --> 00:54:34.440
is really good at it.
I mean, I don't know much

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:38.020
you paid attention to what's
going on in Iraq these days in

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:41.328
the so called surge,
but if you study it as a

00:54:41.328 --> 00:54:44.789
military problem,
then you see how they dealt

00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:49.395
with that military problem.
It is one of the really most

00:54:49.395 --> 00:54:54.047
brilliant things I have ever
seen, because to be successful

00:54:54.047 --> 00:54:59.101
in the war I'm talking about now
requires not only shrewd use of

00:54:59.101 --> 00:55:02.550
military forces for military
purposes,

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:06.111
but it has to be integrated
with constant political

00:55:06.111 --> 00:55:09.530
negotiation and conversation
with the natives,

00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:13.836
which has to be associated also
with certain economic conditions

00:55:13.836 --> 00:55:18.143
being brought about so that the
people who might be on the other

00:55:18.143 --> 00:55:22.176
side can be on your side and
then you can have them work for

00:55:22.176 --> 00:55:24.846
you.
I've only touched on the

00:55:24.846 --> 00:55:28.239
beginning of all the complexity
of that.

00:55:28.239 --> 00:55:31.876
But in any case,
until that happened there are

00:55:31.876 --> 00:55:36.402
very few cases of really
successful urban warfare without

00:55:36.402 --> 00:55:39.115
a tremendous cost.
Well, of course,

00:55:39.115 --> 00:55:41.688
before they figured out what to
do in Iraq they had some

00:55:41.688 --> 00:55:43.699
tremendous costs of not figuring
it out.

00:55:43.699 --> 00:55:46.454
What I'm getting at is,
yes I'm sure that if

00:55:46.454 --> 00:55:49.785
Epaminondas had wanted to,
he would have been able to

00:55:49.785 --> 00:55:52.219
defeat the Spartans in their
city,

00:55:52.219 --> 00:55:54.760
but he would have paid a great
price.

00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:58.860
Now, there's perhaps another
consideration.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:05.951
Before I come to that,
let me just tell you that what

00:56:05.951 --> 00:56:08.997
Epaminondas did.
He bypassed the city,

00:56:08.997 --> 00:56:13.600
ravaged the countryside
wherever he found it,

00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:18.099
doing as much harm as he
possibly could,

00:56:18.099 --> 00:56:21.968
and even as this was happening
and was obviously reported back

00:56:21.968 --> 00:56:26.210
to the Spartans,
the Spartans did not come out

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.624
to fight.
Now, here's where I think once

00:56:29.624 --> 00:56:34.000
again Victor Hansen's splendid
imagination comes into the

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.688
picture in what I find to be a
very persuasive explanation of

00:56:38.688 --> 00:56:42.734
what's going on.
He makes this explanation

00:56:42.734 --> 00:56:47.710
based on an analogy he draws
with the army of general Sherman

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:52.768
during the American Civil War in
Sherman's famous march to the

00:56:52.768 --> 00:56:55.920
sea or his march through
Georgia.

00:56:55.920 --> 00:57:02.055
When there is as confederate
army to the north of where he

00:57:02.055 --> 00:57:05.929
goes but he doesn't seek them
out.

00:57:05.929 --> 00:57:11.266
He goes marching towards where
he wants to get to,

00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:15.840
doing as much damage as he
possibly can,

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:20.260
destroying the food,
the crops, animals,

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.926
everything, burning down
houses, being as nasty and

00:57:25.926 --> 00:57:33.199
unpleasant as he can be.
Why is the question?

00:57:33.199 --> 00:57:35.100
Well, he is a nasty,
unpleasant fellow;

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.033
not really.
We do know a lot about what

00:57:38.033 --> 00:57:41.630
Sherman thought he was doing
because he wrote about it.

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:47.570
Sherman apparently hated the
southern slaveocrisy.

00:57:47.570 --> 00:57:51.608
He wasn't satisfied with
defeating the South as many a

00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:54.797
northerner was,
and then sort of letting it be

00:57:54.797 --> 00:57:58.481
what it had been before or
perhaps destroying slavery

00:57:58.481 --> 00:58:03.300
itself and leaving everything
else pretty much as it had been.

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:07.630
He seems to have thought this
was a terrible wicked society,

00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:11.080
and if it wasn't to go back to
its old bad ways,

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:16.570
it not only had to be defeated;
it had to be humiliated.

00:58:16.570 --> 00:58:19.506
In his view,
part of the success of the

00:58:19.506 --> 00:58:24.373
south was in building up what he
would have thought of as a myth

00:58:24.373 --> 00:58:27.309
of their aristocratic
superiority,

00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:30.511
which made slave holding
appropriate, because the people

00:58:30.511 --> 00:58:34.119
who were superior were ruling
over people who were inferior,

00:58:34.119 --> 00:58:37.203
and they deserved it,
because they were better

00:58:37.203 --> 00:58:40.646
fighters than anybody else.
Everybody thought at the

00:58:40.646 --> 00:58:43.740
beginning of the war,
certainly that the south had a

00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:47.161
better military tradition,
and that they were better

00:58:47.161 --> 00:58:51.349
soldiers, and I think they were
and that they were courageous.

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:54.380
Being a great military man
means being courageous.

00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:58.335
All of that justified the
system and provided the pride

00:58:58.335 --> 00:59:02.547
that made it possible to work.
Well, Sherman wanted to

00:59:02.547 --> 00:59:05.936
show it wasn't so,
and here they were burning down

00:59:05.936 --> 00:59:09.402
houses and barns,
and food, and women folk having

00:59:09.402 --> 00:59:13.232
to stand there and watch it,
and where was the confederate

00:59:13.232 --> 00:59:15.750
army?
They didn't come down to

00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:20.617
challenge them and he felt in
the process, he was destroying

00:59:20.617 --> 00:59:25.510
the myth that was more potent.
Well, I think Hansen certainly

00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.549
has that right when he talks
about Sherman,

00:59:28.549 --> 00:59:32.818
and it's very attractive to
think that maybe Epaminondas was

00:59:32.818 --> 00:59:37.419
after the same thing.
Here were the Spartans cowering

00:59:37.419 --> 00:59:40.138
in their city,
it would be said,

00:59:40.138 --> 00:59:45.840
while Epaminondas was doing as
he liked with the Peloponnesus.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.574
There would never again be a
time where people would accept

00:59:49.574 --> 00:59:52.857
the story that the Spartans were
the great fighters,

00:59:52.857 --> 00:59:55.239
the great heroes etc.,
etc., etc.

00:59:55.239 --> 00:59:59.316
In any case,
that's what he did and then--I

00:59:59.316 --> 01:00:04.722
think all of this is assisted by
some of the things he did and

01:00:04.722 --> 01:00:08.710
some of the things that he
actually said.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:14.605
He went to Mycenae and indeed
he went to the place where the

01:00:14.605 --> 01:00:20.501
Mycenaeans had withdrawn for
security in their rebellions up

01:00:20.501 --> 01:00:27.081
there and he established,
or re-established a city called

01:00:27.081 --> 01:00:30.488
Mycenae.
It was powerfully fortified,

01:00:30.488 --> 01:00:34.999
it was up on a mountain,
it was a place where you could

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:38.873
really defend it,
and it became the capital of

01:00:38.873 --> 01:00:43.673
Mycenae, which would now be a
free Mycenae in which the former

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:46.482
helots,
the former slaves of the

01:00:46.482 --> 01:00:49.684
Spartan state,
would now rule their own

01:00:49.684 --> 01:00:53.559
country as they had not done for
centuries.

01:00:53.559 --> 01:00:58.936
It was a liberation and
that was language that

01:00:58.936 --> 01:01:03.243
Epaminondas used of it.
It had the marvelous

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:07.700
psychological effect that I am
speaking of and also a very

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:10.745
practical one.
Here was a fortress on the

01:01:10.745 --> 01:01:14.175
flank of the Spartans,
which was controlled by people

01:01:14.175 --> 01:01:18.134
who hated the Spartans bitterly
and that would guarantee that

01:01:18.134 --> 01:01:21.894
the Spartans would not lightly
gain control of the western

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:25.510
Peloponnesus again.
If you add to that that the

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:29.381
Arcadians had suffered plenty
from the Spartans and were

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:32.829
unwilling to allow the Spartans
to rise again,

01:01:32.829 --> 01:01:35.901
and there was Megalopolis,
a walled powerful city that

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:39.030
would see to it that the
Spartans would never likely be

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:42.391
able to make their way into
control of central and northern

01:01:42.391 --> 01:01:46.674
Peloponnesus again.
So, all of this combination of

01:01:46.674 --> 01:01:51.586
power and the strategic use of
power, along with this

01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:56.877
psychological warfare that was
involved brought about the

01:01:56.877 --> 01:02:01.129
permanent check on
Sparta.Sparta amazingly

01:02:01.129 --> 01:02:06.797
enough would emerge from this
still an independent city still

01:02:06.797 --> 01:02:10.860
somehow taken seriously by
others,

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:15.852
but never again in the position
of threatening the security of

01:02:15.852 --> 01:02:20.595
other states.
Now, some of what was happening

01:02:20.595 --> 01:02:26.380
began to create a counter force
as it always does.

01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.939
Here was this blatantly
democratic force that had been

01:02:29.939 --> 01:02:33.902
unleashed in the Peloponnesus,
most of which had always been

01:02:33.902 --> 01:02:37.419
oligarchic.
So, in Arcadia there began to

01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:42.266
be a revival of oligarchic
activity, people who wanted to

01:02:42.266 --> 01:02:46.679
overthrow the regime that was
being established,

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:50.919
and to restore oligarchic
governments, which would,

01:02:50.919 --> 01:02:55.412
of course, naturally be
friendly to Sparta and some of

01:02:55.412 --> 01:03:00.500
these oligarchs in Arcadia began
to assist the Spartans.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:04.219
We know the Spartans were
finished but they didn't know

01:03:04.219 --> 01:03:07.039
it.
The Greeks at the time didn't

01:03:07.039 --> 01:03:11.520
know it so that--I'm just
touching on the high points

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.235
here.
In 362, by now I should report

01:03:16.235 --> 01:03:21.622
that Pelopidas was dead.
He had died fighting in

01:03:21.622 --> 01:03:26.836
Thessaly against an autocrat
there by the name of Jason from

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:31.519
the city of Pherae about whom we
don't know a lot,

01:03:31.519 --> 01:03:34.653
except to say he got to be very
powerful indeed,

01:03:34.653 --> 01:03:38.853
and was pretty soon challenging
both Thebes on the land and also

01:03:38.853 --> 01:03:42.653
challenging Athens to some
degree at sea and who knows how

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:46.786
much trouble he would have made
had he not died before he could

01:03:46.786 --> 01:03:50.914
do so.
But Pelopidas died fighting in

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:55.320
a battle against Jason.
I think it was 364.

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.665
So in 362 when the Thebans
again put together a force to

01:03:59.665 --> 01:04:04.633
invade the Peloponnesus,
to put down those forces that

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:09.354
were working against his
settlement, it was only

01:04:09.354 --> 01:04:13.553
Epaminondas who was in charge.
Apparently,

01:04:13.553 --> 01:04:16.733
in the Battle of Mantinea--this
is the second Battle of

01:04:16.733 --> 01:04:20.173
Mantinea,
the first took place in the

01:04:20.173 --> 01:04:25.742
Peloponnesian War in 418,
but this one in 362 apparently

01:04:25.742 --> 01:04:31.715
Epaminondas used some of the
very same tactics that had been

01:04:31.715 --> 01:04:37.587
successful in the battle at
Leuctra and the Thebans won the

01:04:37.587 --> 01:04:42.944
Battle of Mantinea.
However, Epaminondas was killed

01:04:42.944 --> 01:04:48.306
in the fighting and it turned
out that that was more important

01:04:48.306 --> 01:04:52.398
than anything else.
With both Pelopidas and

01:04:52.398 --> 01:04:58.122
Epaminondas gone Thebes never
again shows that kind of special

01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:03.940
quality that brought it swiftly
to power and will swiftly bring

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:07.291
it down.
Although, as we look at the

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:10.608
world in 362,
we should realize that Thebes

01:05:10.608 --> 01:05:15.030
remains a very formidable power
and the Greeks again,

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.758
I want to warn you,
don't know that Thebes isn't

01:05:17.758 --> 01:05:21.300
going to come back with two new
leaders or ten new leaders,

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:24.640
or one or whatever and become
the same kind of a menace that

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:28.195
it had been before,
but looking back we can see

01:05:28.195 --> 01:05:32.866
that that was the outcome.
So, the Thebans won the

01:05:32.866 --> 01:05:36.882
victory, but in effect they
really lost the war,

01:05:36.882 --> 01:05:41.409
because that was the end of
their special quality.

01:05:41.409 --> 01:05:47.383
Since we're all writing about
this, centuries later called

01:05:47.383 --> 01:05:51.679
Epaminondas the foremost man of
Greece.

01:05:51.679 --> 01:05:56.226
There is an inscription,
or there was an inscription,

01:05:56.226 --> 01:06:01.909
on Epaminondas' statue that was
erected on his death at Thebes,

01:06:01.909 --> 01:06:04.599
and it is as though he was
speaking.

01:06:04.599 --> 01:06:09.820
It must have been taken somehow
from something he said or wrote.

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:15.146
Here's what he said,
"By my plans was Sparta shorn

01:06:15.146 --> 01:06:22.429
of her glory and holy Mycenae at
last received back her children.

01:06:22.429 --> 01:06:28.844
By the weapons of Thebes was
Mycenae fortified,

01:06:28.844 --> 01:06:35.260
and all Greece became
independent and free."

01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:38.679
Now, of course,
the claim that everybody was

01:06:38.679 --> 01:06:42.893
seeking independence for the
Greeks, autonomia,

01:06:42.893 --> 01:06:46.789
is an old stale one that never
really worked.

01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:50.551
This is the first time that
I am aware--no actually that's

01:06:50.551 --> 01:06:52.652
not true.
The Spartans entered the

01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:56.267
Peloponnesian War claiming that
they were fighting to free the

01:06:56.267 --> 01:06:57.585
Greeks;
but of course,

01:06:57.585 --> 01:07:00.175
they immediately began
enslaving as many of them as

01:07:00.175 --> 01:07:02.039
they could when they won the
war.

01:07:02.039 --> 01:07:06.244
But Epaminondas says,
well, we did this,

01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:13.036
we accomplished this and at the
end of the day all of Greece was

01:07:13.036 --> 01:07:17.296
free, he claimed.
I'm sure it wasn't perfectly

01:07:17.296 --> 01:07:21.929
true, but there was a lot in it
and that's what he was proud of.

01:07:21.929 --> 01:07:23.909
That's what he thought he was
doing.

01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:26.079
I think that's the important
point about that quotation.

01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:29.930
It tells us what he would have
wanted as indeed it has worked

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.690
out that way,
to come down as his legacy.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:36.349
What did Epaminondas do?
Did he say he increased the

01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:40.014
power of Thebes ten told,
he made Thebes name ring in the

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:42.070
Valhalla;
he never heard of Valhalla.

01:07:42.070 --> 01:07:45.690
The Valhalla of heroes
throughout history,

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.309
that's not what he wanted to
have said.

01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:53.927
What he wanted to have said
was, I restored the Mycenaeans

01:07:53.927 --> 01:07:57.409
to their land,
I restored them to safety,

01:07:57.409 --> 01:08:02.502
I gave them freedom,
I left Greece free and

01:08:02.502 --> 01:08:07.077
independent.
Xenophon, writing after his

01:08:07.077 --> 01:08:13.260
description of the Battle of
Mantinea says the following,

01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:16.878
and these are the last words in
his Hellenica,

01:08:16.878 --> 01:08:20.079
in his history of Greek affairs
in his time.

01:08:20.079 --> 01:08:23.928
"Since nearly all the people of
Greece have come together or had

01:08:23.928 --> 01:08:27.350
come together and formed
themselves in opposing lines,

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:31.271
there was no one who did not
suppose that if a battle were

01:08:31.271 --> 01:08:34.987
fought, those who proved
victorious would be the rulers

01:08:34.987 --> 01:08:38.840
and those who were defeated
would be their subjects.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.571
While each side claimed to be
victorious, neither was found to

01:08:43.571 --> 01:08:47.760
be any better off than before
the battle took place.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:52.539
But there was even more
confusion and disorder in Greece

01:08:52.539 --> 01:08:57.744
after the battle than before."
So, here's a case for the

01:08:57.744 --> 01:09:00.920
unimportance of warfare,
you might say,

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.850
for those people who want to
make that case.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:07.699
Here was all this fighting,
here were all the dead,

01:09:07.699 --> 01:09:10.720
and at the end of the day
nothing had been settled.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:15.967
That is often the case in war.
Although, it might be said,

01:09:15.967 --> 01:09:20.160
that something pretty serious
had been settled by the

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.757
campaigns that the Thebans had
fought before the Battle of

01:09:24.757 --> 01:09:29.677
Mantinea and that Greece would
never be the same again because

01:09:29.677 --> 01:09:33.789
of the fighting that had taken
place before.

01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:39.234
But as we look forward not
backward, it's worth noticing

01:09:39.234 --> 01:09:43.689
that the years of competition
for hegemony,

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:49.632
which go back you know at least
to the days after the Persian

01:09:49.632 --> 01:09:54.090
Wars, had left Greece weakened
and divided,

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:59.026
and therefore,
open for exploitation and even

01:09:59.026 --> 01:10:04.859
conquests by a new threat from
outside the system,

01:10:04.859 --> 01:10:11.282
which was not even dreamed of
by the Greeks as a menace in 362

01:10:11.282 --> 01:10:16.456
at the Battle of Mantinea.
There's something to be

01:10:16.456 --> 01:10:20.362
learned in there too.
I mean, if you had taken a poll

01:10:20.362 --> 01:10:23.737
of the Greeks and said,
where are the dangers to us

01:10:23.737 --> 01:10:25.883
now,
what problems do we have,

01:10:25.883 --> 01:10:29.831
they would have been talking
about the traditional conflicts

01:10:29.831 --> 01:10:33.608
between the Greek city states.
No one, I think,

01:10:33.608 --> 01:10:38.801
would have used the word
Macedonia as part of anything

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:41.798
that looked scary,
and, of course,

01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:45.304
nobody would have uttered the
name Philip, because Philip

01:10:45.304 --> 01:10:47.619
wasn't even king of Macedonia
yet.

01:10:47.619 --> 01:10:51.234
And yet, within a few years,
Philip would be the king of

01:10:51.234 --> 01:10:55.047
Macedonia, and within a couple
or three decades there would

01:10:55.047 --> 01:10:58.859
suddenly be a real menace from
the north that would be very

01:10:58.859 --> 01:11:03.000
threatening and we'll take a
look at that next time.

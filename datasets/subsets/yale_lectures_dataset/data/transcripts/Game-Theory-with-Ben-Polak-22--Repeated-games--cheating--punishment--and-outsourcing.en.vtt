00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.545
Professor Ben Polak:
So last time we were

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.629
focusing on repeated interaction
and that's what we're going to

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.324
continue with today.
There's lots of things we could

00:00:12.324 --> 00:00:16.691
study under repeated interaction
but the emphasis of this week is

00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.307
can we attain--can we
achieve--cooperation in business

00:00:20.307 --> 00:00:23.650
or personal relationships
without contracts,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.060
by use of the fact that these
relationships go on over time?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.513
Our central intuition,
where we started from last

00:00:31.513 --> 00:00:35.614
time, was perhaps the future of
a relationship can provide

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:38.420
incentives for good behavior
today,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.440
can provide incentives for
people not to cheat.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.500
So specifically let's just
think of an example.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.600
We'll go back to where we were
last time.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.288
Specifically suppose I have a
business relationship,

00:00:49.288 --> 00:00:51.660
an ongoing business
relationship with Jake.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.767
And each period I'm supposed to
supply Jake with some inputs for

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.180
his business,
let's say some fruit.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.075
And each period he's supposed
to provide me with some input

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.560
for my business,
namely vegetables.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.623
Clearly there are opportunities
here, in each period,

00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:11.045
for us to cheat.
We could cheat both on the

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.270
quality of the fruit that I
provide or the quantity of the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.203
fruit that I provide to Jake,
and he can cheat on the

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:20.300
quantity or quality of the
vegetables that he provides to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.873
me.
Our central intuition is:

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:27.906
perhaps what can give us good
incentives is the idea that if

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:31.554
Jake cooperates today,
then I might cooperate

00:01:31.554 --> 00:01:34.170
tomorrow, I might not cheat
tomorrow.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.082
Conversely, if he cheats and
provides me with lousy

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:40.402
vegetables today I'm going to
provide him with lousy fruit

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:42.364
tomorrow.
Similarly for me,

00:01:42.364 --> 00:01:46.401
if I provide Jake with lousy
fruit today he can provide me

00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:51.160
with lousy vegetables tomorrow.
So what do we need?

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.139
We need the difference in the
value of the promise of good

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.293
behavior tomorrow and the threat
of bad behavior tomorrow to

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:05.049
outweigh the temptation to cheat
today.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.135
I'm going to gain by providing
him with the bad fruit or fewer

00:02:08.135 --> 00:02:11.221
fruit today--bad fruit because
those I would otherwise have to

00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:14.066
throw away.
So that temptation to cheat has

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:18.104
to be outweighed by the promise
of getting good vegetables in

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:20.729
the future from Jake and vice
versa.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.009
So here's that idea on the
board.

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:30.257
What we need is the gain if I
cheat today to be outweighed by

00:02:30.257 --> 00:02:35.505
the difference between the value
of my relationship with Jake

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:40.666
after cooperating and the value
of my relationship with Jake

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:44.815
after cheating tomorrow.
Now what we discovered last

00:02:44.815 --> 00:02:47.413
time--this was an idea I think
we kind of knew,

00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:50.351
we have kind of known it since
the first week--but we

00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.352
discovered last time,
somewhat surprisingly,

00:02:53.352 --> 00:02:55.720
that life is not quite so
simple.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.285
In particular,
what we discovered was we need

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:05.369
these to be credible,
so there's a problem here of

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.895
credibility.
So in particular,

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:15.588
if we think of the value of the
relationship after cooperating

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:20.847
tomorrow as being a promise,
and the value of the

00:03:20.847 --> 00:03:25.027
relationship after cheating as
being a threat,

00:03:25.027 --> 00:03:29.949
we need these promises and
threats to be credible.

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.840
We need to actually believe
that they're going to happen.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.993
And one very simple area where
we saw that ran immediately into

00:03:36.993 --> 00:03:39.807
problems was if this repeated
relationship,

00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:42.419
although repeated,
had a known end.

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.960
Why did known ends cause
problems for us?

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.807
Because in the last period,
in the last period of the game

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:54.127
we know that whatever we promise
to do or whatever we threaten to

00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:55.660
do,
in the last period,

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.730
once we reached that last
period, in that sub-game we're

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.740
going to play a Nash
equilibrium.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.468
What we do has to be consistent
with our incentives in the last

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:06.218
period.
So in particular,

00:04:06.218 --> 00:04:10.198
if there's only one Nash
equilibrium in that last period,

00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:14.108
then we know in that last
period that's what we're going

00:04:14.108 --> 00:04:17.061
to do.
So if we look at the second to

00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:21.404
last period we might hope that
we could promise to cooperate,

00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:24.009
if you cooperate today,
tomorrow.

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:26.822
Or you could promise to punish
tomorrow if you cheat today,

00:04:26.822 --> 00:04:29.489
but those threats won't be
credible because we know that

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:32.011
tomorrow you're just going to
play whatever that Nash

00:04:32.011 --> 00:04:35.298
equilibrium is.
That lack of credibility means

00:04:35.298 --> 00:04:39.305
there's no scope to provide
incentives today for us to

00:04:39.305 --> 00:04:43.009
cooperate and we saw things
unravel backwards.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.110
So the way in which we ensure
that we're really focusing on

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.387
credible promises and credible
threats here is by focusing on

00:04:53.387 --> 00:04:59.187
sub-game perfect equilibrium,
the idea that we introduced

00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:03.050
just before the Thanksgiving
break.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.426
We know that sub-game perfect
equilibria have the property

00:05:05.426 --> 00:05:07.470
that they have Nash behavior in
every sub-game,

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.480
so in particular in the last
period of the game and so on.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.855
So what we want to be able to
do here, is try to find scope

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.939
for cooperation in relationships
without contracts,

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:20.950
without side payments,
by focusing on sub-game perfect

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.750
equilibria of these repeated
games.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.388
Right at the end last time,
we said okay,

00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:29.950
let's move away from the
setting where we know our game

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.774
is going to end,
and let's look at a game which

00:05:33.774 --> 00:05:37.029
continues, or at least might
continue.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:44.334
So in particular,
we looked at the problem of the

00:05:44.334 --> 00:05:53.007
Prisoner's Dilemma which was
repeated with the probability

00:05:53.007 --> 00:05:58.790
that we called δ
each period,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.540
with the probability δ
of continuing.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.319
So every period we're going to
play Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:16.459
However, with probability 1 -
δ the game might just end

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.091
every period.
We already noticed last time

00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:21.425
some things about this.
The first thing we noticed was

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:24.303
that we can immediately get away
from this unraveling argument

00:06:24.303 --> 00:06:26.379
because there's no known end to
the game.

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:30.723
We don't have to worry about
that thread coming loose and

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:34.568
unraveling all the way back.
So at least there's some hope

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:37.606
here to be able to establish
credible promises and credible

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:40.643
threats later on in the game
that will induce good behavior

00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:44.524
earlier on in the game.
So that's where we were last

00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:49.525
time, And here is the Prisoner's
Dilemma, we saw this time,

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:54.009
and we actually focused on a
particular strategy.

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:57.013
But before I come back to this
strategy that we focused on last

00:06:57.013 --> 00:06:59.290
time let's just see some things
that won't work,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:01.180
just to sort of reinforce the
idea.

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.459
So here's a possible strategy
in the Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.608
A possible strategy in the
Prisoner's Dilemma would be

00:07:07.608 --> 00:07:11.757
cooperate now and go on
cooperating regardless of what

00:07:11.757 --> 00:07:14.095
anyone does.
So let's just cooperate forever

00:07:14.095 --> 00:07:15.459
regardless of the history of the
game.

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:18.059
Now if two players,
if Jake and I are involved in

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.262
this business relationship,
which has the structure of a

00:07:21.262 --> 00:07:24.411
Prisoner's Dilemma and both of
us play this strategy of

00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:27.560
cooperate now and cooperate
forever no matter what,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.200
clearly that will induce
cooperation.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.331
That's the good news.
The problem is that isn't an

00:07:34.331 --> 00:07:36.500
equilibrium, that's not even a
Nash equilibrium,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.529
let alone a sub-game perfect
equilibrium.

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:42.040
Why is it not a sub-game
perfect equilibrium?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.672
Because in particular,
if Jake is smart (and he is),

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.839
Jake will look at this
equilibrium and say:

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:49.420
Ben is going to cooperate no
matter what I do,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.387
so I may as well cheat,
and in fact,

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:55.001
I may as well go on cheating.
So Jake has a very good

00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:59.069
deviation there which is simply
to cheat forever.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:02.997
So the strategy cooperate now
and go on cooperating no matter

00:08:02.997 --> 00:08:06.532
what doesn't contain incentives
to support itself as an

00:08:06.532 --> 00:08:09.406
equilibrium.
And we need to focus on

00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:14.331
strategies that contain subtle
behavior that generates promises

00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:18.858
of rewards and threats of
punishment that induce people to

00:08:18.858 --> 00:08:22.750
actually stick to that
equilibrium behavior.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.675
So is everyone clear that
cooperating no matter what--it

00:08:25.675 --> 00:08:27.910
sounds good--but it isn't going
to work.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.689
People aren't going to stick
with that.

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:32.143
So instead what we focused on
last time, and actually we had

00:08:32.143 --> 00:08:34.555
some players who seemed to
actually--they've moved now--but

00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:36.759
they seemed actually to be
playing this strategy.

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:41.070
We focused on what we called
the grim trigger strategy.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.110
And the grim trigger strategy
is what?

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.107
It says in the first period
cooperate and then go on playing

00:08:48.107 --> 00:08:51.918
cooperate as long as nobody has
ever defected,

00:08:51.918 --> 00:08:56.671
nobody has ever cheated.
But if anybody ever plays D,

00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:01.604
anybody ever plays the defect
strategy, then we just play D

00:09:01.604 --> 00:09:04.605
forever.
So this is a strategy,

00:09:04.605 --> 00:09:10.049
it tells us what to do at every
possible information set.

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:11.683
It also, if two players are
playing the strategy,

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:13.385
has the property that they will
cooperate forever:,

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:16.116
that's good news.
And what we left ourselves last

00:09:16.116 --> 00:09:19.759
time was checking that this
actually is an equilibrium,

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:23.088
or more generally,
under what conditions is this

00:09:23.088 --> 00:09:26.299
actually an equilibrium.
So we got halfway through that

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:29.788
calculation last time.
So what we need to do is we

00:09:29.788 --> 00:09:34.936
need to make sure that the
temptation of cheating today is

00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:39.993
less than the value of the
promise minus the value of the

00:09:39.993 --> 00:09:43.718
threat tomorrow.
We did parts of this already,

00:09:43.718 --> 00:09:47.697
let's just do the easy parts.
So the temptation today is:

00:09:47.697 --> 00:09:51.177
if I cheat today I get 3,
whereas if I went on

00:09:51.177 --> 00:09:56.590
cooperating today I get 2.
So the temptation is just 1.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:04.000
What's the threat?
The threat is playing D

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:14.039
forever, so this is actually the
value of (D, D) forever.

00:10:14.039 --> 00:10:15.763
You've got to be careful about
for ever: when I say for ever,

00:10:15.763 --> 00:10:17.371
I mean until the game ends
because eventually the game is

00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:20.035
going to end,
but let's use the code for ever

00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:23.240
to mean until the game ends.
What's the promise?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:29.727
The promise is the value of
continuing cooperation,

00:10:29.727 --> 00:10:35.948
so the value of (C,C) for ever.
That's what this bracket is,

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:37.680
and it's still tomorrow.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.329
So let's go on working on this.
So the value of cooperating for

00:10:46.329 --> 00:10:50.209
ever is actually--let's be a bit
more detailed--this is the value

00:10:50.209 --> 00:10:56.149
of getting 2 in every period,
so it's value of 2 for ever;

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:02.130
and this is the value of 0
forever.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:12.327
So the value of 0 forever,
that's pretty easy to work out:

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:15.957
I get 0 tomorrow,
I get 0 the day after tomorrow,

00:11:15.957 --> 00:11:18.490
I get 0 the day after the day
after tomorrow.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.360
Or more accurately:
I get 0 tomorrow,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.269
I get 0 the day after tomorrow
if we're still playing,

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:27.538
I get 0 the day after the day
after tomorrow if we're still

00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:29.954
playing and so on.
But that isn't a very hard

00:11:29.954 --> 00:11:31.590
calculation, this thing is going
to equal 0.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:42.736
So this object here is just 0.
This object here is 3 - 2,

00:11:42.736 --> 00:11:46.330
I can do that one in my head,
that's 1.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.960
So I'm left with the value of
getting 2 for ever,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.440
and that requires a little bit
more thought.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.188
But let's do that one bit of
algebra because it's going to be

00:11:56.188 --> 00:11:59.181
useful throughout today.
So this thing here,

00:11:59.181 --> 00:12:02.309
the value of 2 for ever is
what?

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:04.543
Well I get 2,
that's tomorrow,

00:12:04.543 --> 00:12:08.317
and then, assuming I'm still
playing the day after

00:12:08.317 --> 00:12:13.016
tomorrow--so I need to discount
it--with probability of δ

00:12:13.016 --> 00:12:18.100
I'm still playing the day after
tomorrow--and I get 2 again.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:22.399
And the day after the day after
tomorrow I'm still playing with

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:26.491
the probability that the game
didn't end tomorrow and didn't

00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:30.305
end the next day so that's with
probability δ²

00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:33.054
and again I get 2.
And then the day after,

00:12:33.054 --> 00:12:34.528
what is it?
This is tomorrow,

00:12:34.528 --> 00:12:37.202
the day after tomorrow,
the day after the day after

00:12:37.202 --> 00:12:40.303
tomorrow: this is the day after
the day after the day after

00:12:40.303 --> 00:12:42.870
tomorrow which is δ³
2 and so on.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:46.502
Everyone happy with that?
So starting from tomorrow,

00:12:46.502 --> 00:12:48.425
if we play (C,
C) for ever,

00:12:48.425 --> 00:12:52.049
I'll get 2 tomorrow,
2 the day after tomorrow,

00:12:52.049 --> 00:12:54.409
2 the day after the day after
tomorrow, and so on.

00:12:54.409 --> 00:12:56.360
And I just need to take an
account of the fact that the

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.129
game may end between tomorrow
and the next day,

00:12:58.129 --> 00:13:00.947
the game may end between the
day after tomorrow and the day

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:02.940
after the day after tomorrow and
so on.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.145
Everyone happy with that?
So what is the value,

00:13:07.145 --> 00:13:11.440
what is thing?
Let's call this X for a second.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.577
So we've done this once before
in the class but let's do it

00:13:13.577 --> 00:13:15.702
again anyway.
This is the geometric sum,

00:13:15.702 --> 00:13:19.150
some of you may even remember
from high school how to do a

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.629
geometric sum,
but let's do it slowly.

00:13:21.629 --> 00:13:29.518
So to work out what X is what
I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:13:29.518 --> 00:13:35.039
multiply X by δ,
so what's δX?

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:43.337
So this 2 here will become a
2δ, and this δ2 here

00:13:43.337 --> 00:13:50.011
will become a δ²2,
and this δ²2 will

00:13:50.011 --> 00:13:54.422
become a δ³2,
and this δ³2 will

00:13:54.422 --> 00:13:59.159
become a δ^(4)2,
and so on.

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:02.751
Now what I'm going to do is I'm
going to subtract the second of

00:14:02.751 --> 00:14:05.299
those lines from the first of
those lines.

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:12.263
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to subtract

00:14:12.263 --> 00:14:15.146
X--δX.
So I'm going to subtract the

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:19.386
second line from the first line.
And when I do that I'm going to

00:14:19.386 --> 00:14:25.221
notice I hope that this 2δ
is going to cancel with this

00:14:25.221 --> 00:14:29.004
2δ,
and this δ²2 is going

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:31.873
to cancel with this
δ²2,

00:14:31.873 --> 00:14:36.219
and this δ³2 is going
to cancel with this

00:14:36.219 --> 00:14:41.296
δ³2 and so on.
So what I'm going to get left

00:14:41.296 --> 00:14:44.228
with is what?
Everything's going to cancel

00:14:44.228 --> 00:14:47.985
except for what?
Except for that first 2 there,

00:14:47.985 --> 00:14:52.629
so this is just equal to 2.
Now this is a calculation I can

00:14:52.629 --> 00:15:03.690
do.
So I've got X = 2 / [1-δ].

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:08.248
So just to summarize the
algebra, getting 2 forever,

00:15:08.248 --> 00:15:12.985
that means 2 + δ2 +
δ²2 + δ³2

00:15:12.985 --> 00:15:18.011
etc..
The value of that object is

00:15:18.011 --> 00:15:22.992
2/[1-δ].
So we can put that in here as

00:15:22.992 --> 00:15:27.469
well.
This object here 2/[1-δ]

00:15:27.469 --> 00:15:32.563
is the value of 2 forever.
Now before I go onto a new

00:15:32.563 --> 00:15:34.590
board I want to do one other
thing.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.528
On the left hand side I've got
my temptation,

00:15:38.528 --> 00:15:43.988
that was 1, I've got the value
of cooperating forever starting

00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:47.031
from tomorrow which is
2/[1-δ]

00:15:47.031 --> 00:15:52.043
and I've got the value of
defecting forever starting from

00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:57.635
tomorrow which is 0.
However, all of these objects

00:15:57.635 --> 00:16:02.211
on the right hand side,
they start tomorrow,

00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:06.680
whereas, the temptation today
is today.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.590
Temptation today happens today.
These differences in value

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:14.894
start tomorrow.
Since they start tomorrow I

00:16:14.894 --> 00:16:18.400
need to discount them because we
don't know that tomorrow is

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.701
going to happen.
The world may end,

00:16:20.701 --> 00:16:23.566
or more importantly the
relationship may end,

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:27.294
between today and tomorrow.
So how much do I have to weight

00:16:27.294 --> 00:16:30.991
them by?
By δ, I need to multiply

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:35.379
all of these lines by δ
and so on.

00:16:35.379 --> 00:16:37.870
Now this is now a mess so let's
go to a new board.

00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:51.640
Now let's summarize what we now
have, What we're doing here is

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:58.770
asking is it the case that if
people play the grim trigger

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:04.900
strategy that that is in fact an
equilibrium?

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.259
That is a way of sustaining
cooperation.

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:17.881
The answer is we need 1,
that's our temptation,

00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:27.725
to be less than 2/[1-δ],
that's the value of cooperating

00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:32.922
for ever starting from tomorrow,
minus 0, that's the value of

00:17:32.922 --> 00:17:36.299
defecting forever starting
tomorrow,

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:39.851
and this whole thing is
multiplied by δ

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:42.660
because tomorrow may not
happen.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.049
Everyone happy with that so far?
I'm just kind of collecting up

00:17:47.049 --> 00:17:50.039
the terms that we did slowly
just now.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:53.252
So now what I want to do
is--question mark here because

00:17:53.252 --> 00:17:57.180
we don't know whether it is--I'm
going to solve this for δ.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.750
So when I solve this for δ
I'll probably get it wrong,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:06.200
but let's be careful.
So this is equivalent to saying

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:12.155
1-δ &lt;
2δ and it's also

00:18:12.155 --> 00:18:20.213
equivalent to saying therefore
that δ &gt;

00:18:20.213 --> 00:18:27.360
= 1/3.
Everyone happy with that?

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:37.059
Let me just turn my own page.
So what have we shown so far?

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:40.303
We've shown that if we're
playing the grim trigger

00:18:40.303 --> 00:18:44.009
strategy, and we want to deter
people from doing what?

00:18:44.009 --> 00:18:47.519
From defecting from this
strategy in the very first

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:51.799
period, then we're okay provided
δ is bigger than 1/3.

00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:56.366
But at this point some of you
could say, yeah but that's just

00:18:56.366 --> 00:19:01.009
one of the possible ways I could
defect from this strategy.

00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:03.904
After all, the defection we
just considered,

00:19:03.904 --> 00:19:08.009
the move away from equilibrium
we just considered was what?

00:19:08.009 --> 00:19:12.953
We considered my cheating
today, but thereafter,

00:19:12.953 --> 00:19:18.527
I reversed it back to doing
what I was supposed to do:

00:19:18.527 --> 00:19:23.049
I went along with playing D
thereafter.

00:19:23.049 --> 00:19:25.430
So the particular defection we
looked at just now was in Period

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.351
1, I'm going to defect,
but thereafter,

00:19:27.351 --> 00:19:31.131
I'm actually going to do what
the equilibrium strategy tells

00:19:31.131 --> 00:19:35.571
me to do.
I'm going to go along with the

00:19:35.571 --> 00:19:41.200
punishment and play my part of
(D,D) forever.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.990
So you might want to ask,
why would I do that?

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:47.841
Why would I go along?
I cheated the first time but

00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:50.620
now I'm doing what the strategy
tells me to do.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.640
It tells me to play D.
Why am I going along with that?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.028
You could consider going away
from the equilibrium by

00:19:58.028 --> 00:20:00.440
defecting, for example in Period
1,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.113
and then in Period 2 do
something completely different

00:20:04.113 --> 00:20:11.245
like cooperating.
So we might want to worry,

00:20:11.245 --> 00:20:23.099
how about playing D now and
then C in the next period,

00:20:23.099 --> 00:20:29.230
and then D forever.
That's just some other way of

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.159
defecting.
So far we've said I'm going to

00:20:31.159 --> 00:20:33.509
defect by playing D and then
playing D forever,

00:20:33.509 --> 00:20:37.521
but now I'm saying let's play D
now and then play a period of C

00:20:37.521 --> 00:20:40.555
and then D forever.
Is that going to be a

00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:44.129
profitable deviation?
Well let's see what I'd get if

00:20:44.129 --> 00:20:47.767
I do that particular deviation.
What play is that going to

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:50.222
induce?
Remember the other player is

00:20:50.222 --> 00:20:53.396
playing equilibrium,
so that player is going to

00:20:53.396 --> 00:20:56.984
induce, in the first period,
I'm playing D and Jake's

00:20:56.984 --> 00:20:59.938
playing C.
In the second period Jake's

00:20:59.938 --> 00:21:03.846
going to start punishing me,
so he's going to play D and

00:21:03.846 --> 00:21:07.470
according to this deviation I'm
going to play C.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.796
So in the second period I'll
play C and Jake will play D,

00:21:12.796 --> 00:21:18.217
and in the third period and
thereafter, we'll just play D,

00:21:18.217 --> 00:21:21.207
D, D, D, D, D.
So these are just some other

00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:23.170
deviation other than the one we
looked at.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.160
So what payoff do I get from
this?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:33.079
Okay, I get three in the first
period, just as I did for my

00:21:33.079 --> 00:21:37.059
original defection,
that's good news.

00:21:37.059 --> 00:21:42.111
But now in the second period
discounted, I actually get -1,

00:21:42.111 --> 00:21:47.423
I'm actually doing even worse
in the second period because I'm

00:21:47.423 --> 00:21:50.819
cooperating while Jake's
defecting,

00:21:50.819 --> 00:21:57.802
and then in the third period I
get 0 and in the fourth period I

00:21:57.802 --> 00:22:03.822
get 0 and so on.
So the total payoff to this

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:10.836
defection is 3 - δ.
Now, that's even worse than the

00:22:10.836 --> 00:22:15.009
defection we considered to start
with.

00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:18.967
The defection we considered to
start with, I got 3 in the first

00:22:18.967 --> 00:22:22.237
period and thereafter I got 0.
Now I got 3 in the first

00:22:22.237 --> 00:22:25.099
period, -1 in the second period,
and then 0 thereafter.

00:22:25.099 --> 00:22:28.068
So this defection in which I
defect--this move away from

00:22:28.068 --> 00:22:31.468
equilibrium--in which I cheat in
the first period and then don't

00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:36.109
go along with the punishment,
I don't in fact play D forever

00:22:36.109 --> 00:22:40.370
is even worse.
Is that right? It's even worse.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:45.408
So what's the lesson here?
The lesson here is the reason

00:22:45.408 --> 00:22:52.439
that I'm prepared to go along
with my own punishment and play

00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:57.009
D forever after a defection is
what?

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:59.609
It's if Jake is going to play D
forever I may as well play D

00:22:59.609 --> 00:23:01.109
forever.
Is that right?

00:23:01.109 --> 00:23:04.689
So another way of saying this
is the only way which I could

00:23:04.689 --> 00:23:07.589
possibly hope to have a
profitable deviation,

00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:11.206
given that Jake's going to
revert to playing D forever is

00:23:11.206 --> 00:23:15.145
for me to defect on Jake once
and then go along with playing D

00:23:15.145 --> 00:23:18.372
forever.
There's no point once he's

00:23:18.372 --> 00:23:23.087
playing D, there's no point me
doing anything else,

00:23:23.087 --> 00:23:26.860
so this is worse,
this is even worse.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:30.542
This defection is even worse.
More generally,

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:35.566
the reason this is even worse
is because the punishment we

00:23:35.566 --> 00:23:39.986
looked at before,
which was (D,

00:23:39.986 --> 00:23:48.771
D) for ever,
the punishment (D,D) forever is

00:23:48.771 --> 00:23:55.928
itself an equilibrium.
It's credible because it's

00:23:55.928 --> 00:23:57.740
itself an equilibrium.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.559
So unlike in the finitely
repeated games we did last time,

00:24:07.559 --> 00:24:12.009
unlike in the two period or the
five period repeated games,

00:24:12.009 --> 00:24:14.644
here the punishment really is a
credible punishment,

00:24:14.644 --> 00:24:17.693
because what I'm doing in the
punishment phase is playing an

00:24:17.693 --> 00:24:20.728
equilibrium.
There's no point considering

00:24:20.728 --> 00:24:25.304
any other deviation other than
playing D once and then just

00:24:25.304 --> 00:24:29.346
going on playing D.
So that's one other possible

00:24:29.346 --> 00:24:34.289
deviation, but there are others
you might want to consider.

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:37.500
So far all we've considered is
what?

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:40.760
We've considered the deviation
where I, in the very first

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.079
period, I cheat on Jake and then
I just play D forever.

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:45.660
But what about the second
period?

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:58.010
Another thing I could do is how
about cheating not in the first

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:05.780
period of the game but in the
second.

00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:11.539
So according to this strategy
what am I going to do.

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:16.658
The first period of the game
I'll go along with Jake and

00:25:16.658 --> 00:25:21.869
cooperate, but in the second
period I'll cheat on him.

00:25:21.869 --> 00:25:25.280
Now how am I going to check
whether that's a good deviation

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.648
or not?
How do I know that's not going

00:25:28.648 --> 00:25:32.653
to be a good deviation?
Well we already know that I'm

00:25:32.653 --> 00:25:36.240
not going to want to cheat in
the first period of the game.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.067
I want to argue that exactly
the same analysis tells me I'm

00:25:40.067 --> 00:25:44.160
not going to want to cheat in
the second period of the game.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.841
Why?
Because once we reach the

00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:49.671
second period of the game,
it is the first period

00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:51.808
of the game.
Once we reach the second period

00:25:51.808 --> 00:25:54.240
of the game, looking from period
two onwards,

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.922
it's exactly the same as it was
when we looked from period one

00:25:59.922 --> 00:26:02.110
initially.
So to say it again,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:05.490
what we argued before was--on
the board that I've now covered

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:11.433
up--what we argued before was,
I'm not going to want to cheat

00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:18.376
in the very first period of the
game provided δ

00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:21.468
&gt; 1/3.
I want to claim that that same

00:26:21.468 --> 00:26:24.434
argument tells me I'm not going
to want to cheat in the second

00:26:24.434 --> 00:26:26.720
period of the game provided
δ &gt; 1/3.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.821
I'm not going to want to cheat
in the fifth period of the game

00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:34.079
provided δ
&gt; 1/3.

00:26:34.079 --> 00:26:35.157
Because this game from the
fifth period on,

00:26:35.157 --> 00:26:36.029
or the five hundredth period
on,

00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:39.799
or the thousandth period on
looks exactly the same as is it

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:48.634
does from the beginning.
So what's neat about this

00:26:48.634 --> 00:27:05.780
argument is the same analysis
says, this is not profitable if

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.210
δ &gt; 1/3.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:23.180
So what have we learned here?
I want to show you some nerdy

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.460
lessons and then some actual
sort of real world lessons.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:30.029
Let's start with the nerdy
lessons.

00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:34.342
The nerdy lesson is this grim
strategy works because

00:27:34.342 --> 00:27:39.247
both--let's put it up again so
we can actually see it--this

00:27:39.247 --> 00:27:44.336
grim strategy,
it works because both the play

00:27:44.336 --> 00:27:51.112
that it suggests if we both
cooperate and the play that it

00:27:51.112 --> 00:27:57.769
suggests if we both defect are
themselves equilibria.

00:27:57.769 --> 00:28:03.044
These are credible threats and
credible promises because what

00:28:03.044 --> 00:28:07.967
you end up doing both in the
promise and in the threat is

00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:14.349
itself equilibrium behavior.
That's good.

00:28:14.349 --> 00:28:20.622
The second thing we've learned,
however, is for this to work we

00:28:20.622 --> 00:28:25.074
need δ &gt;
1/3, we need the probability

00:28:25.074 --> 00:28:29.019
continuation to be bigger than
1/3.

00:28:29.019 --> 00:28:35.146
So leaving aside the nerdy
stuff for a second--you have

00:28:35.146 --> 00:28:42.293
more practice on the nerdy stuff
on the homework assignment--the

00:28:42.293 --> 00:28:49.440
lesson is we can get cooperation
in the Prisoner's Dilemma using

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.712
the grim trigger.
Remember the grim trigger

00:28:52.712 --> 00:28:54.248
strategy is cooperate until
someone defects and then defect

00:28:54.248 --> 00:28:57.275
forever.
So you get cooperation in the

00:28:57.275 --> 00:29:02.370
Prisoner's Dilemma using the
grim trigger as a sub-game

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.491
perfect equilibrium.
So this is an equilibrium

00:29:07.491 --> 00:29:13.867
strategy, that's good news,
provided the probability of

00:29:13.867 --> 00:29:18.000
continuation is bigger than 1/3.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:26.275
Let's try and generalize that
lesson away from the Prisoner's

00:29:26.275 --> 00:29:28.513
Dilemma.
So last time our lesson was

00:29:28.513 --> 00:29:31.168
about what in general could we
hope for in ongoing

00:29:31.168 --> 00:29:34.243
relationships?
So let's put down a more

00:29:34.243 --> 00:29:39.180
general lesson that refines what
we learned last time.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:52.817
So the more general lesson is,
in an ongoing relationship--let

00:29:52.817 --> 00:30:04.666
me mimic exactly the words I
used last time--so for an

00:30:04.666 --> 00:30:17.857
ongoing relationship to provide
incentives for good behavior

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:23.301
today,
it helps--what we wrote last

00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:29.119
time was--it helps for that
relationship to have a future.

00:30:29.119 --> 00:30:45.451
But now we can refine this,
it helps for there to be a high

00:30:45.451 --> 00:30:59.529
probability that the
relationship will continue.

00:30:59.529 --> 00:31:02.818
So the specific lesson for
Prisoner's Dilemma and the grim

00:31:02.818 --> 00:31:05.702
trigger strategy is we need
δ, the probability

00:31:05.702 --> 00:31:08.009
continuation,
to be bigger than 1/3.

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:11.401
But the more general intuition
is, if we want my ongoing

00:31:11.401 --> 00:31:14.731
business relationship with me
and Jake to generate good

00:31:14.731 --> 00:31:18.184
behavior--so I'm going to
provide him with good fruit and

00:31:18.184 --> 00:31:21.698
he's going to provide me with
good vegetables--we need the

00:31:21.698 --> 00:31:24.966
probability that that
relationship will continue to be

00:31:24.966 --> 00:31:28.567
reasonably high.
I claim this is a very natural

00:31:28.567 --> 00:31:30.319
intuition.
Why?

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:34.603
Because the probability that
the relationship will continue

00:31:34.603 --> 00:31:37.779
is the weight that you put on
the future.

00:31:37.779 --> 00:31:44.429
The probability that the
relationship will continue,

00:31:44.429 --> 00:31:51.600
this thing, this is the weight
you put on the future.

00:31:56.180 --> 00:32:00.921
The more weight I put on the
future, the easier it is for the

00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:05.029
future to give me incentives to
behave well today,

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:08.198
the easier it is for those to
overcome the temptations to

00:32:08.198 --> 00:32:10.892
cheat today.
That seems like a much more

00:32:10.892 --> 00:32:14.910
general lesson than just the
Prisoner's Dilemma example.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:19.309
Let's try to push this to some
examples and see if it rings

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:21.738
true.
So the lesson we've got here is

00:32:21.738 --> 00:32:25.229
to get cooperation in these
relationships we need there to

00:32:25.229 --> 00:32:28.328
be a high probability,
a reasonably high probability

00:32:28.328 --> 00:32:30.900
that they're going to continue.
We know exactly what that is

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:32.640
for Prisoner's Dilemma but the
lesson seems more general.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.680
So here's two examples.
How many of you are seniors?

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:37.860
One or two, quite a few are
seniors.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.508
Keep your hands up a second.
All of those of you who are

00:32:40.508 --> 00:32:43.690
seniors--we can pan these guys.
Let's have a look at them.

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:49.336
Actually, why don't we get all
the seniors to stand up:

00:32:49.336 --> 00:32:54.315
make you work a bit here.
Now the tricky question,

00:32:54.315 --> 00:32:58.326
the tricky personal question.
How many of you who are seniors

00:32:58.326 --> 00:33:00.365
are currently involved in
personal relationships,

00:33:00.365 --> 00:33:01.980
you know: have a significant
other?

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.470
Stay standing up if you have a
significant other.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:09.818
Look at this, it's pathetic.
What have I been saying about

00:33:09.818 --> 00:33:12.225
economic majors?
All right, so let's just think

00:33:12.225 --> 00:33:15.127
about, stay standing a second,
let's get these guys to think

00:33:15.127 --> 00:33:18.572
about it a second.
So seniors who are involved in

00:33:18.572 --> 00:33:22.190
ongoing relationships with
significant others,

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:26.049
what do we have to worry about
those seniors?

00:33:26.049 --> 00:33:28.372
Well these seniors are about to
depart from the beautiful

00:33:28.372 --> 00:33:30.611
confines of New Haven and
they're going to take jobs in

00:33:30.611 --> 00:33:33.923
different parts of the world.
And the problem is some of them

00:33:33.923 --> 00:33:37.496
are going to take jobs in New
York while their significant

00:33:37.496 --> 00:33:40.442
other takes a job in San
Francisco or Baghdad or

00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:43.337
whatever,
let's hope not Baghdad,

00:33:43.337 --> 00:33:47.602
London shall we say.
Now if it's the case that you

00:33:47.602 --> 00:33:52.030
are going to take a job in New
York next year and your

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:57.460
significant other is going to
take a job in Baghdad or London,

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.562
or anyway far away,
in reality, being cynical a

00:34:00.562 --> 00:34:04.406
little bit, what does that do to
the probability that your

00:34:04.406 --> 00:34:09.010
relationship is going to last?
It makes it go down.

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.775
It lowers the probability that
your relationship's going to

00:34:12.775 --> 00:34:15.474
continue.
So what is the

00:34:15.474 --> 00:34:21.177
prediction--let's be mean here.
These are the people with

00:34:21.177 --> 00:34:23.699
significant others who are
seniors, how many of you are

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:26.549
going to be separated by a long
distance from your significant

00:34:26.549 --> 00:34:29.076
others next period?
Well one of them at the back,

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:30.288
okay one guy,
at the back,

00:34:30.288 --> 00:34:32.810
two guys, honesty here,
three, four of you right?

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.136
So what's our prediction here?
What does this model predict as

00:34:36.136 --> 00:34:39.429
a social science experiment.
What does it predict?

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.896
It predicts that for those of
you who just raised your hands,

00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:46.363
those seniors who just raised
their hands who are about to be

00:34:46.363 --> 00:34:49.542
separated by large distances,
those relationships,

00:34:49.542 --> 00:34:52.724
each player in that
relationship is going to have a

00:34:52.724 --> 00:34:56.079
lower value on the future.
So during the rest of your

00:34:56.079 --> 00:34:59.564
senior year, during the spring
of your senior year what's the

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:04.800
prediction of this model?
They're going to cheat.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.098
So we could actually do a
controlled experiment,

00:35:08.098 --> 00:35:12.238
what we should do here is we
should keep track of the people

00:35:12.238 --> 00:35:14.933
here,
the seniors who are going to be

00:35:14.933 --> 00:35:19.260
separated--you can sit down now,
I'm sorry to embarrass you all.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:22.001
We could keep track of those
seniors who are about to be

00:35:22.001 --> 00:35:24.544
separated and go into a long
distance relationships,

00:35:24.544 --> 00:35:27.969
and those that are not.
The people who are not are our

00:35:27.969 --> 00:35:30.565
control group.
And we should see if during the

00:35:30.565 --> 00:35:33.625
spring semester the people who
are going to be separated cheat

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:36.989
more often than the others.
So it's a very clear prediction

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:40.110
of the model that's relevant to
some of your lives.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:43.660
Let me give you another example
that's less exciting perhaps,

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.656
but same sort of thing.
Consider the relationship that

00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:52.251
I have with my garage mechanic.
I should stress this is not a

00:35:52.251 --> 00:35:56.688
significant other relationship.
So I have a garage mechanic in

00:35:56.688 --> 00:36:00.570
New Haven, and that garage
mechanic fixes my car.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.590
And we have an ongoing business
relationship.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:06.339
He knows that whenever my car
needs fixing,

00:36:06.339 --> 00:36:09.809
even if it's just a small thing
like an oil change,

00:36:09.809 --> 00:36:12.726
I'm going to go to him and have
him fix it, even though it might

00:36:12.726 --> 00:36:15.179
be cheaper for me to go to Jiffy
Lube or something.

00:36:15.179 --> 00:36:17.284
So I'm going to take my car to
him to be fixed,

00:36:17.284 --> 00:36:19.846
and he's going to make some
money off me on even the easy

00:36:19.846 --> 00:36:22.153
things.
What do I want in return for

00:36:22.153 --> 00:36:24.406
that?
I want him to be honest and if

00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:27.889
all I need is an oil change I
want him to tell me that,

00:36:27.889 --> 00:36:30.458
and if what I actually need is
a new engine,

00:36:30.458 --> 00:36:34.273
he tells me I need new engine.
So my cooperating with him,

00:36:34.273 --> 00:36:38.150
is always going to him,
even if it's something simple;

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:41.825
and his cooperating with me,
is his not cheating on fixing

00:36:41.825 --> 00:36:43.976
the car.
He knows more about the car

00:36:43.976 --> 00:36:45.962
than I do.
But now what happens if he

00:36:45.962 --> 00:36:49.235
knows either that I'm about to
leave town (which is the example

00:36:49.235 --> 00:36:51.430
we just did),
or, more realistically,

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.130
he kind of knows that my car is
a lemon and I'm about to get rid

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.479
of it anyway.
Once I get a new car I'm not

00:36:57.479 --> 00:37:00.147
going to go to him anymore
because I have to go to the

00:37:00.147 --> 00:37:02.059
dealer to keep the warranty
intact.

00:37:02.059 --> 00:37:04.292
So he knows that my car is
about to break down anyway,

00:37:04.292 --> 00:37:06.566
and he knows that I know that
the car is about to break

00:37:06.566 --> 00:37:09.574
anyway,
so my lemon of a car is about

00:37:09.574 --> 00:37:14.928
to be passed on--probably to one
of my graduate students--then

00:37:14.928 --> 00:37:18.358
what's going to happen?
So I'm going to have an

00:37:18.358 --> 00:37:21.453
incentive to cheat because I'm
going to start taking my useless

00:37:21.453 --> 00:37:23.500
car to Jiffy Lube for the oil
changes.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.010
And he's going to have an
incentive to cheat.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.279
He's going to start telling me
you know you really need a new

00:37:30.279 --> 00:37:33.331
engine or a new clutch--it's a
manual so I have a clutch:

00:37:33.331 --> 00:37:36.656
it's a real car--so I'm going
to need a new clutch rather than

00:37:36.656 --> 00:37:40.243
just tightening up a bolt.
So once again the probability

00:37:40.243 --> 00:37:42.722
of the continuation of the
relationship,

00:37:42.722 --> 00:37:45.200
as it changes,
it leads to incentives to

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.976
cheat.
It leads to that relationship

00:37:47.976 --> 00:37:50.536
breaking down.
That's the content,

00:37:50.536 --> 00:37:54.840
that's the real world content
of the math we just did.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.929
Let's try and push this a
little further.

00:37:59.929 --> 00:38:05.500
Now what we've shown is that
the grim trigger works provided

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.279
δ &gt; 1/3,
and δ being bigger than

00:38:09.279 --> 00:38:13.809
1/3 doesn't seem like a very
large continuation probability.

00:38:13.809 --> 00:38:16.736
So just having a probability of
1/3 that the relationship

00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:18.879
continues allows the grim
trigger to work,

00:38:18.879 --> 00:38:21.440
so that seems good news for the
grim trigger.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.580
However, in reality,
in the real world,

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:28.630
the grim trigger might have
some disadvantages.

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.684
So let's just think about what
the grim trigger is telling us

00:38:30.684 --> 00:38:33.576
in the real world.
It's telling us that if even

00:38:33.576 --> 00:38:38.382
one of us cheats just a little
bit--I just provide one item of

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:42.952
rotten fruit to Jake or he gives
me one too few branches of

00:38:42.952 --> 00:38:47.601
asparagus in his provisions to
me--then we never do business

00:38:47.601 --> 00:38:51.150
with each other again ever.
It's completely the end.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.969
We just never cooperate again.
That seems a little bit drastic.

00:38:54.969 --> 00:38:57.440
It's a little bit draconian if
you like.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.050
So in particular,
in the real world,

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:04.450
there's a complication here,
in the real world every now and

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:08.030
then one of us going "to cheat"
by accident.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.871
That day that I didn't have my
glasses on and I put in a rotten

00:39:10.871 --> 00:39:12.750
apple in the apples I supplied
to Jake.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.425
In the fruit,
he was counting out the

00:39:15.425 --> 00:39:19.735
asparagus and he lost count at
1,405 and he gave me one too

00:39:19.735 --> 00:39:22.366
few.
So we might want to worry about

00:39:22.366 --> 00:39:26.440
the fact that the grim trigger,
it's triggered by any amount of

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:30.317
cheating and it's very drastic:
it says we never do business

00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:33.838
again.
The grim trigger is the analog

00:39:33.838 --> 00:39:37.992
of the death penalty.
It's the business analog of the

00:39:37.992 --> 00:39:40.080
death penalty.
It's not that I'm going to kill

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.909
Jake if he gives me one too few
branches of asparagus,

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:43.360
but I'm going to kill the
relationship.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.004
For you seniors or otherwise,
who are involved in personal

00:39:47.004 --> 00:39:50.010
relationships,
it's the equivalent of saying,

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:51.845
if you even see your partner
looking at someone else,

00:39:51.845 --> 00:39:53.470
let alone sitting next to them
in the class,

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:58.070
the relationship is over.
It seems drastic.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:00.925
So we might be interested
because mistakes happen,

00:40:00.925 --> 00:40:05.163
because misperceptions happen,
we might be interested in using

00:40:05.163 --> 00:40:09.679
punishments that are less
draconian than the grim trigger,

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:11.410
less draconian than the death
penalty.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:14.611
Is that right?
So what I want to do is I want

00:40:14.611 --> 00:40:17.909
to consider a different
strategy, a strategy other than

00:40:17.909 --> 00:40:21.390
the grim trigger strategy,
and see if that could work.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:27.967
So where shall I start?
Let's start here,

00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:34.430
so again what I'm going to
revert to is the math and the

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:41.599
nerdiness of our analysis of the
Prisoner's Dilemma but I want

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:47.239
you to have in mind business
relationships,

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:48.640
your own personal
relationships,

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.427
your friendships and so on.
More or less everything you do

00:40:51.427 --> 00:40:54.234
in life involves repeated
interaction, so have that in the

00:40:54.234 --> 00:40:56.449
back of your mind,
but let's be nerdy now.

00:40:56.449 --> 00:41:07.730
So what I want to consider is a
one period punishment.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:10.473
So how are we going to write
down a strategy that has

00:41:10.473 --> 00:41:12.690
cooperation but a one period
punishment.

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:21.654
So here's the strategy.
It says--it's kind of weird

00:41:21.654 --> 00:41:33.201
thing but it works--play C to
start and then play C if--this

00:41:33.201 --> 00:41:44.552
is going to seem weird but trust
me for a second--play C if

00:41:44.552 --> 00:41:53.360
either (C, C) or (D,D) were
played last.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.352
So, if in the previous period
either both people cooperated or

00:41:58.352 --> 00:42:02.280
both people defected,
then we'll play cooperation

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:07.490
this period.
And play D otherwise:

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:17.150
play D if either (C,
D) or (D, C) were played last.

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:18.500
Let's just think about this
strategy for a second.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:23.552
What does that strategy mean?
So provided people start off

00:42:23.552 --> 00:42:26.694
cooperating and they go on
cooperating--if both Jake and I

00:42:26.694 --> 00:42:29.780
play this strategy--in fact,
we'll cooperate forever.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.852
Is that right?
So I claim this is a one period

00:42:33.852 --> 00:42:36.909
punishment strategy.
Let's just see how that works.

00:42:36.909 --> 00:42:40.409
So suppose Jake and I are
playing this strategy.

00:42:40.409 --> 00:42:42.420
We're supposed to play C every
period.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:49.039
And suppose deliberately or
otherwise, I play D.

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:53.422
So now in that period in which
I play D, the strategys played

00:42:53.422 --> 00:42:57.541
were D by me and C by Jake.
So next period what does this

00:42:57.541 --> 00:43:02.053
strategy tell us both to play?
So it was D by me and C by

00:43:02.053 --> 00:43:05.980
Jake, so this strategy tells us
to play D.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.619
So next period both of us will
play D.

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:13.356
So both of us will be
uncooperative precisely for that

00:43:13.356 --> 00:43:16.857
period, that next period.
Now, what about the period

00:43:16.857 --> 00:43:18.935
after that?
The period after that,

00:43:18.935 --> 00:43:22.300
Jake will have played D,
I will have played D.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:26.063
So this is what will have
happened: we both played D,

00:43:26.063 --> 00:43:29.030
and now it tells us to
cooperate again.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:34.471
Everyone happy with that?
So this strategy I've written

00:43:34.471 --> 00:43:37.192
down--it seems kind of
cumbersome--but what it actually

00:43:37.192 --> 00:43:39.510
induces is exactly a one period
punishment.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.861
If Jake is the only cheat then
we both defect for one period

00:43:43.861 --> 00:43:47.362
and go back to cooperation.
If I'm the only person who

00:43:47.362 --> 00:43:50.244
cheats then we both defect for
one period and go back to

00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:53.085
cooperation.
It's a one period punishment

00:43:53.085 --> 00:43:55.042
strategy.
Of course the question is,

00:43:55.042 --> 00:43:57.533
the question you should be
asking is, is this going to

00:43:57.533 --> 00:44:00.290
work?
Is this an equilibrium?

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:08.200
So let's just check.
Is this an SPE.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:13.780
Is it an equilibrium?
So what do we need to check?

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:22.473
We need to check,
as usual, that the temptation

00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:33.624
is less than or equal to the
value of the promise--the value

00:44:33.624 --> 00:44:44.964
of the promise of continuing in
cooperation--the value of the

00:44:44.964 --> 00:44:53.280
promise minus the value of the
threat.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:59.274
And once again we have to be
careful, because the temptation

00:44:59.274 --> 00:45:05.980
occurs today and this difference
between values occurs tomorrow.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.372
Is that right?
So this is nothing new,

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:09.714
this is what we've always
written down,

00:45:09.714 --> 00:45:13.247
this is what we have to check.
So the temptation for me to

00:45:13.247 --> 00:45:17.192
cheat today, that's the same as
it was before,

00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:23.084
it's 3 - 2.
The fact that it's tomorrow is

00:45:23.084 --> 00:45:28.060
going to give me a δ
here.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.211
Here's our square bracket.
So what's the value of the

00:45:31.211 --> 00:45:33.262
promise?
So provided we both go on

00:45:33.262 --> 00:45:36.403
cooperating, we're going to go
on cooperating forever,

00:45:36.403 --> 00:45:39.190
in which case we're going to
get 2 for ever.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.939
Is that right?
So this is going to be the

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:50.074
value of 2 forever starting
tomorrow (and again for ever

00:45:50.074 --> 00:45:56.570
means until the game ends).
The value of the threat is what?

00:45:56.570 --> 00:46:03.049
Be a bit careful now.
It's the value of--so what's

00:46:03.049 --> 00:46:08.446
going to happen?
If I cheat then tomorrow we're

00:46:08.446 --> 00:46:12.111
both going to cheat,
so tomorrow,

00:46:12.111 --> 00:46:16.119
what am I going to get
tomorrow?

00:46:16.119 --> 00:46:19.887
0.
So it's the value of 0

00:46:19.887 --> 00:46:29.307
tomorrow: we're both going to
cheat, we're both going to play

00:46:29.307 --> 00:46:32.122
D.
And then the next period what's

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:34.804
going to happen?
We're going to play C again,

00:46:34.804 --> 00:46:37.699
and from thereon we're going to
go on playing C.

00:46:37.699 --> 00:46:46.329
So it's going to the value of 0
tomorrow and then 2 forever

00:46:46.329 --> 00:46:54.510
starting the next day.
That's what we have to evaluate.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:59.360
So 3 - 2, I can do that one
again, that's 1.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:03.499
So what's the value of 2
forever, well we did that

00:47:03.499 --> 00:47:05.950
already today,
what was it?

00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:08.820
It's in your notes.
Actually it's on the board,

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:11.010
it's the X up there,
what is it?

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:14.593
Here it is, 2 for ever:
we figured out the value of it

00:47:14.593 --> 00:47:17.230
before and it was
2/[1–δ].

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:27.290
So the value of 2 forever is
going to be 2/[1–δ].

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:32.922
How about the value of 0?
So starting for tomorrow I'm

00:47:32.922 --> 00:47:38.531
going to get 0 and then with one
period delay I'm going to get 2

00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:40.436
for ever.
Well 2 forever,

00:47:40.436 --> 00:47:43.668
we know what the value of that
is, it's 2/[1–δ],

00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:46.010
but now I get it with one
period delay,

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.900
so what do I have to multiply
it by?

00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:53.296
By δ good.
So the value of 0 tomorrow and

00:47:53.296 --> 00:47:58.392
then 2 forever starting the next
day is δ

00:47:58.392 --> 00:48:01.974
x 2/[1–δ].
And here's the δ

00:48:01.974 --> 00:48:04.402
coming from here which just
takes into account that all this

00:48:04.402 --> 00:48:07.143
analysis is starting tomorrow.
So to summarize,

00:48:07.143 --> 00:48:11.441
this is my temptation today.
This is what I'll get starting

00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:13.949
tomorrow if I'm a good boy and
cooperate.

00:48:13.949 --> 00:48:16.289
And this is the value of what
I'll get if I cheat today.

00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:19.139
Starting tomorrow I'll get
nothing, and then I'll revert

00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:22.544
back to cooperation.
And since all of these values

00:48:22.544 --> 00:48:27.229
in this square bracket start
tomorrow I've discounted them by

00:48:27.229 --> 00:48:29.518
δ.
Now this requires some math so

00:48:29.518 --> 00:48:32.334
bear with me while I probably
get some algebra wrong--and

00:48:32.334 --> 00:48:35.250
please can I get the T.A.'s to
stare at me a second because

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.750
I'll probably get this wrong.
Okay so what I'm going to do

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:42.138
is, I'm going to look at my
notes, I'm going to cheat,

00:48:42.138 --> 00:48:46.309
that's what I'm going to do.
Okay, so what I'm going to do

00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:50.010
is I'm going to have 1 is less
than or equal to,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:55.146
I'm going to take a common
factor of 2 / [1–δ]

00:48:55.146 --> 00:49:00.650
and δ, so I'm going to
have 2δ/[1–δ],

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:06.226
and that's going to leave
inside the square brackets:

00:49:06.226 --> 00:49:09.980
this is a 1 and this is a
δ.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.438
So this δ
here was that δ

00:49:16.438 --> 00:49:19.503
there, and then I took out a
common factor of

00:49:19.503 --> 00:49:22.360
2/[1–δ]
from this bracket.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:24.121
Everyone okay with the algebra?
Just algebra,

00:49:24.121 --> 00:49:30.787
nothing fancy going on there.
So that's good because now the

00:49:30.787 --> 00:49:37.210
1-δ cancels,
this cancels with this,

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:45.720
so this tells us we're okay
provided 1/2 &lt;= δ:

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.543
it went up.
So don't worry too much about

00:49:49.543 --> 00:49:51.488
the algebra, trust me on the
algebra a second,

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.260
let's just worry about the
conclusion.

00:49:53.260 --> 00:49:58.647
What's the conclusion?
The conclusion is that this one

00:49:58.647 --> 00:50:02.670
period punishment is an SPE,
it will be enough,

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:07.105
one period of punishment will
be enough to sustain cooperation

00:50:07.105 --> 00:50:11.032
in my Prisoner's Dilemma
repeated business relationship

00:50:11.032 --> 00:50:13.492
with Jake,
or in the seniors'

00:50:13.492 --> 00:50:16.936
relationships with their
significant others,

00:50:16.936 --> 00:50:19.179
provided δ
&gt; 1/2.

00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:21.227
What did δ
need to be for the grim

00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:25.320
strategy?
1/3, so what have we learned

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:30.407
here?
We learned--nerdily--what we

00:50:30.407 --> 00:50:38.771
learned was that for the grim
strategy we needed δ

00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:42.965
&gt; 1/3.
For the one period punishment

00:50:42.965 --> 00:50:46.590
we needed δ
&gt; 1/2, but what's the more

00:50:46.590 --> 00:50:50.283
general lesson?
The more general lesson is,

00:50:50.283 --> 00:50:55.186
if you use a softer punishment,
a less draconian punishment,

00:50:55.186 --> 00:50:59.840
for that to work we're going to
need a higher δ.

00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.565
Is that right?
So what we're learning here is

00:51:04.565 --> 00:51:08.926
there's a trade off,
there's a trade off in

00:51:08.926 --> 00:51:13.237
incentives.
And the trade off is if you use

00:51:13.237 --> 00:51:16.648
a shorter punishment,
a less draconian

00:51:16.648 --> 00:51:22.088
punishment--instead of cutting
people's hands off or killing

00:51:22.088 --> 00:51:24.747
them,
or never dealing with them

00:51:24.747 --> 00:51:28.957
again, you just don't deal with
them for one period--that's okay

00:51:28.957 --> 00:51:32.432
provided there's a slightly
higher probability of the

00:51:32.432 --> 00:51:39.771
relationship continuing.
So shorter punishments are okay

00:51:39.771 --> 00:51:49.704
but they need--the implication
sign isn't really necessary

00:51:49.704 --> 00:51:58.940
there--they need more weight
δ on the future.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:02.482
I claim that's very intuitive.
What its saying is,

00:52:02.482 --> 00:52:06.300
we're always trading things off
in the incentives.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:11.548
We're trading off the ability
to cheat and get some cookies

00:52:11.548 --> 00:52:15.983
today versus waiting and,
we hope, getting cookies

00:52:15.983 --> 00:52:18.030
tomorrow.
So if, in fact,

00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:21.337
the difference between the
reward and the punishment isn't

00:52:21.337 --> 00:52:24.225
such a big deal,
isn't so big--the punishment is

00:52:24.225 --> 00:52:27.854
just, I'm going to give you one
fewer cookies tomorrow--then you

00:52:27.854 --> 00:52:31.309
better be pretty patient not to
go for the cookies today.

00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:33.360
I was about to say,
those of you who have children.

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.909
I'm probably the only person in
the room with children.

00:52:35.909 --> 00:52:38.377
That cookie example will
resonate for the rest of

00:52:38.377 --> 00:52:40.999
you--wait until you get
there--you'll discover that,

00:52:40.999 --> 00:52:43.210
in fact, cookies are the right
example.

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:46.822
So shorter punishment,
less draconian punishments,

00:52:46.822 --> 00:52:51.172
less reduction in your kid's
cookie rations tomorrow is only

00:52:51.172 --> 00:52:54.331
going to work,
is only going to sustain good

00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:58.119
behavior provided those kids put
a high weight on tomorrow.

00:52:58.119 --> 00:53:00.541
In that case,
it isn't that the kids will

00:53:00.541 --> 00:53:03.084
worry about the relationship
breaking down,

00:53:03.084 --> 00:53:06.111
you're stuck with your kids,
it's just that they're

00:53:06.111 --> 00:53:09.061
impatient.
Okay, so we've been doing a lot

00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:12.960
of formal stuff here and I want
to go on doing formal stuff,

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.649
but what I want to do now is
spend the rest of today looking

00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:19.540
at an application.
An application is,

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:25.007
I hope going to convince you
that repeated interaction really

00:53:25.007 --> 00:53:28.491
matters.
So this is assuming that the

00:53:28.491 --> 00:53:33.543
one about the seniors and their
boyfriends and girlfriends

00:53:33.543 --> 00:53:36.842
wasn't enough.
Okay, so the application is

00:53:36.842 --> 00:53:40.892
going to take us back a little
bit because what I want to talk

00:53:40.892 --> 00:53:43.150
about is repeated moral hazard.

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:51.801
Moral hazard is something we
discussed the first class after

00:53:51.801 --> 00:53:55.368
the mid-term.
So what I want you to imagine

00:53:55.368 --> 00:53:59.190
is that you are running a
business in the U.S.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:03.205
and you are considering making
an investment in an emerging

00:54:03.205 --> 00:54:06.078
market, and again,
so as not to offend anybody who

00:54:06.078 --> 00:54:08.719
watches this on the video,
let's just call that emerging

00:54:08.719 --> 00:54:11.917
market Freedonia,
rather than give it a name like

00:54:11.917 --> 00:54:15.960
Kazakhstan, a name like
something other than Freedonia.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:18.735
So Freedonia,
for those of you who don't

00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:22.010
know, is a republic in a Marx
Brothers film.

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:25.760
So you're thinking of
outsourcing some production of

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.070
part of what your business is to
Freedonia.

00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:31.045
The reason you're thinking of
doing this outsourcing,

00:54:31.045 --> 00:54:33.400
what makes it attractive is
that wages are low in Freedonia.

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:35.389
So you get this outsourced in
Freedonia.

00:54:35.389 --> 00:54:38.349
You think you're going to get
it done cheaply.

00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:42.126
The down side is because
Freedonia is an emerging market,

00:54:42.126 --> 00:54:45.429
the court system,
it doesn't operate very well.

00:54:45.429 --> 00:54:48.422
And in particular,
it's going to be pretty hard to

00:54:48.422 --> 00:54:52.210
enforce contracts and to jail
people and so on in Freedonia.

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.010
So you're considering
outsourcing.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:56.924
The plus is,
from your point of view,

00:54:56.924 --> 00:54:59.956
the plus is wages are cheap
where you're going to get this

00:54:59.956 --> 00:55:02.674
production done.
The down side is it's going to

00:55:02.674 --> 00:55:05.708
be hard to enforce contracts
because this is an emerging

00:55:05.708 --> 00:55:07.882
market.
So what you're considering

00:55:07.882 --> 00:55:11.689
doing is employing an agent and
you're going to pay that agent

00:55:11.689 --> 00:55:14.309
W, so W is the wage if you
employ them.

00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:16.420
I'll put this up in a tree in a
second.

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:22.813
Let's assume that the "going
wage" in Freedonia is 1:

00:55:22.813 --> 00:55:27.449
we'll just normalize it.
So the going wage in Freedonia

00:55:27.449 --> 00:55:30.232
is 1, and let's assume that to
get this outsourcing to work

00:55:30.232 --> 00:55:33.160
you're going to have to send
some resources to your agent,

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:37.900
your employee in Freedonia.
And let's assume that the

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:40.007
amount you're going to have to
send over there is equivalent to

00:55:40.007 --> 00:55:42.629
another 1.
So the going wage in Freedonia

00:55:42.629 --> 00:55:47.280
is 1 and the amount you're going
to have to invest in giving this

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.550
agent materials or machinery is
another 1.

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:55.159
Let's assume that this project
is a pretty profitable project.

00:55:55.159 --> 00:55:59.980
So if the project succeeds,
if the project goes ahead and

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:04.800
succeeds, it's going to generate
a gross revenue of 4.

00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.678
Of course you have to invest 1
so that's a net revenue of 3 for

00:56:08.678 --> 00:56:12.369
you, but nonetheless there's a
big potential return here.

00:56:12.369 --> 00:56:18.219
The bad news is that your agent
in Freedonia can cheat on you.

00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:21.282
In particular,
what he can do is he can simply

00:56:21.282 --> 00:56:23.800
take the 1 that you've sent to
him,

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.929
sell those materials on the
market and then go away and just

00:56:27.929 --> 00:56:32.099
work in his normal job anyway.
So he can get his normal wage

00:56:32.099 --> 00:56:35.025
of 1 for just going and doing
his normal job,

00:56:35.025 --> 00:56:38.218
whatever that was,
and he can steal the resources

00:56:38.218 --> 00:56:40.857
from you.
So let's put this up as a kind

00:56:40.857 --> 00:56:42.612
of tree.
This is a slight cheat,

00:56:42.612 --> 00:56:44.880
this tree, but we'll see why in
a second.

00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:55.300
So your decision is to invest
and set W.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.219
So if you invest in Freedonia,
you'll invest and set W,

00:56:59.219 --> 00:57:02.050
set the wage you're going to
pay him.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:06.265
The going wage is 1 but you can
set a different wage or you

00:57:06.265 --> 00:57:09.816
could just not invest.
If you don't invest you get

00:57:09.816 --> 00:57:13.430
nothing and your agent in
Freedonia just gets the going

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:16.482
wage of 1.
If you do invest in Freedonia

00:57:16.482 --> 00:57:20.320
and set a wage of W,
then your agent has a choice.

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:28.130
Either he can be honest or he
can cheat.

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.099
If he cheats,
what's going to happen to you?

00:57:30.099 --> 00:57:33.610
You had to invest 1 in sending
it over there,

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:37.840
you're going to get nothing
back, so you'll get -1.

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.248
And he will go away and work
his normal job and get 1,

00:57:42.248 --> 00:57:45.991
and, in addition,
he'll sell your materials so

00:57:45.991 --> 00:57:50.048
he'll get a total of 1 + 1 is?
2, thank you.

00:57:50.048 --> 00:57:53.937
So he'll get a total of 2.
On the other hand,

00:57:53.937 --> 00:57:56.982
if he's honest,
then you're going to get a

00:57:56.982 --> 00:58:01.440
return of 4 minus the 1 you had
to invest minus whatever wage

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:07.234
you paid to him.
So your return will be 3 minus

00:58:07.234 --> 00:58:12.801
the wage you pay him.
You're only going to pay him

00:58:12.801 --> 00:58:17.460
once the job's done,
3 - W, and he's going to get W.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.387
He's done his job--he hasn't
exercised his outside option,

00:58:20.387 --> 00:58:23.110
he hasn't sold your
materials--so he'll just get W.

00:58:23.110 --> 00:58:26.533
Now, I'm slightly cheating here
because this isn't really the

00:58:26.533 --> 00:58:29.957
way the tree looks because I
could choose different levels of

00:58:29.957 --> 00:58:32.078
W.
So this upper branch where I

00:58:32.078 --> 00:58:35.699
invest and set W is actually a
continuum of such branches,

00:58:35.699 --> 00:58:38.239
one for each possible W,
I could set.

00:58:38.239 --> 00:58:40.570
But for the purpose of today
this is enough.

00:58:40.570 --> 00:58:43.119
This gives us what we needed to
see.

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:47.699
So let's imagine that this is a
one shot investment.

00:58:47.699 --> 00:58:50.950
What I want to learn is in this
one shot investment,

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:54.058
I invest in Freedonia.
I hire my agent once,

00:58:54.058 --> 00:58:58.494
what I want to learn is how
much do I have to pay that agent

00:58:58.494 --> 00:59:02.349
to actually get the job done?
Remember the starting position.

00:59:02.349 --> 00:59:08.059
The starting position is it
looks very attractive.

00:59:08.059 --> 00:59:11.274
It looks very attractive
because the returns on this

00:59:11.274 --> 00:59:15.588
project are 4 or 4 - 1,
so that the surplus available

00:59:15.588 --> 00:59:21.065
on this project is 3 minus the
wage, and the going wage was

00:59:21.065 --> 00:59:23.128
just 1.
So it looks like there's lots

00:59:23.128 --> 00:59:25.210
of profit around to make this
outsourcing profitable.

00:59:25.210 --> 00:59:27.300
I mumbled that so let me try it
again.

00:59:27.300 --> 00:59:30.614
So the reason this looks
attractive is the going wage is

00:59:30.614 --> 00:59:34.110
just 1, so if I just pay him 1
and he does the project then

00:59:34.110 --> 00:59:37.726
I'll get a gross return of 4
minus the 1 I invested minus the

00:59:37.726 --> 00:59:40.860
1 that I had to pay him for a
net return of 2.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.709
It seems like that's a 100%
profitable project,

00:59:44.709 --> 00:59:48.800
so it looks very attractive.
What's the problem?

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.813
The problem is if I only
set--this is going to give us

00:59:52.813 --> 00:59:57.659
backward induction--if I set the
wage equal to the going wage,

00:59:57.659 --> 01:00:01.920
so if I set W = 1 what will my
agent do?

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:10.559
He's going to cheat.
The problem is if I set W = 1,

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:20.440
which is the going wage,
the going wage in Freedonia,

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:26.523
the agent will cheat.
If he cheats I just lose my

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:30.272
investment.
So how much do I have to set

01:00:30.272 --> 01:00:32.930
the W to?
Let's look at this.

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:38.456
So we have to set W.
What I need is I need his wage

01:00:38.456 --> 01:00:43.103
to be big enough so that being
honest and going on with my

01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:46.610
projectoutweighs his incentive
to cheat.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:53.550
I need W to be bigger than 2.
Is that right?

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.289
I need W to be at least as big
as 2.

01:00:56.289 --> 01:01:02.435
So in setting the wage,
in equilibrium,

01:01:02.435 --> 01:01:08.673
what are we going to do?
I'm going to set a wage,

01:01:08.673 --> 01:01:13.079
let's call it W* = 2 (plus a
penny), is that right?

01:01:13.079 --> 01:01:18.039
So this is an exercise which we
visited the first day after the

01:01:18.039 --> 01:01:20.579
mid-term.
This is about incentive design.

01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:27.032
In this one shot game,
which we can easily solve by

01:01:27.032 --> 01:01:33.484
backward induction,
I'm going to need to set a wage

01:01:33.484 --> 01:01:38.130
equal to 2, and then he'll work.

01:01:42.559 --> 01:01:44.309
So in a minute,
we're going to look at the

01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:46.698
repeated version of this,
but before we do let's just sum

01:01:46.698 --> 01:01:51.039
up where we are so far.
What is this telling us?

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:55.172
It's telling us that when you
invest in an emerging market,

01:01:55.172 --> 01:01:59.518
where the courts don't work so
they aren't going to be able to

01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:03.010
enforce this guy to work
well--in particular,

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:05.351
he can run off with your
investment--even though wages

01:02:05.351 --> 01:02:07.869
are low, so it seems very
attractive to do outsourcing,

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:12.529
if you worry about getting
incentives right you're going to

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:17.269
have pay an enormous wage
premium to get the guy to work.

01:02:17.269 --> 01:02:23.754
So the going wage in Freedonia
was 1, but you had to set a wage

01:02:23.754 --> 01:02:29.820
equal to 2, a 100% wage premium,
to get the guy to work.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:38.909
So the wage premium in this
emerging market is 100%,

01:02:38.909 --> 01:02:47.820
you're paying 2 even though the
going wage is 1.

01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:52.010
By the way, this is not an
unreasonable prediction.

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:55.260
If you look at the wages payed
by European and American

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.030
companies in some of these
emerging markets,

01:02:58.030 --> 01:02:59.789
which have very,
very low going wages,

01:02:59.789 --> 01:03:02.595
and if you look at the wages
that are actually being paid by

01:03:02.595 --> 01:03:05.258
the companies that are doing
outsourcing you see enormous

01:03:05.258 --> 01:03:08.213
wage premiums.
You see enormous premiums over

01:03:08.213 --> 01:03:13.777
and above the going wage.
Now what I want to do is I want

01:03:13.777 --> 01:03:20.814
to revisit exactly the same
situation, but now we're going

01:03:20.814 --> 01:03:25.630
to introduce the wrinkle of the
day.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:28.836
What's the wrinkle of the day?
The wrinkle of the day is

01:03:28.836 --> 01:03:31.679
you're not only going to invest
in Freedonia today,

01:03:31.679 --> 01:03:34.829
but if things go well you'll
invest tomorrow,

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:38.910
and if things go well again
you'll invest the day after at

01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:42.059
least with some significant
probability.

01:03:42.059 --> 01:03:44.505
So the wage premium we just
calculated was the one shot wage

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:47.661
premium.
It was getting this job--this

01:03:47.661 --> 01:03:52.010
single one shot job--outsourced
to Freedonia.

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.907
Now I want to consider how much
you're going to have to pay,

01:03:54.907 --> 01:03:57.509
what are wages going to be in
Freedonia in the foreign

01:03:57.509 --> 01:04:00.436
investment sector,
if instead of just having a one

01:04:00.436 --> 01:04:03.653
shot, one job investment,
you're investing for the long

01:04:03.653 --> 01:04:05.658
term.
You're going to be in Freedonia

01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:11.773
for a while.
So consider repeated

01:04:11.773 --> 01:04:25.730
interaction with probability
δ of continuing.

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.719
So we don't know that you're
going to go on in Freedonia.

01:04:27.719 --> 01:04:30.414
Things might break down in
Freedonia because there's a

01:04:30.414 --> 01:04:31.923
coup.
It might break down in

01:04:31.923 --> 01:04:35.069
Freedonia because the American
administration says you're not

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:37.010
allowed to do outsourcing
anymore.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.407
All sorts of things might
happen, but with some

01:04:38.407 --> 01:04:39.805
probability δ
the relationship is going to

01:04:39.805 --> 01:04:42.610
continue.
So repeated interaction with

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:47.134
probability of δ.
Let's redo the exercise we did

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:51.119
before to see what wage you'll
have to charge.

01:04:51.119 --> 01:05:04.349
Our question is what
wage--let's call it W**--what

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:09.750
wage will you pay?

01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:17.170
The way we're going to solve
this, is exactly using the

01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:19.309
methods we've learned in this
class.

01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:32.529
So what we're going to compare
is the temptation to cheat

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:46.220
today--and we better make sure
that that's less than δ

01:05:46.220 --> 01:06:00.620
times the value of continuing
the relationship minus the value

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:12.969
of ending the relationship.
Let's call this tomorrow.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.248
So what's happening now is,
once again, I'm employing my

01:06:16.248 --> 01:06:19.150
agent in Freedonia,
and provided he does a good

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:22.145
job, I'll employ him again
tomorrow, at least with

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:24.880
probability δ.
But if he doesn't do a good

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:27.714
job, if he runs off with my
investment and doesn't do my

01:06:27.714 --> 01:06:32.430
job, what am I going to do?
What would you do?

01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:38.114
You'd fire him.
So the punishment--it's clear

01:06:38.114 --> 01:06:41.090
what the punishment's going to
be here--the punishment is,

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:43.440
if he doesn't do a good job,
you fire him.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.929
The value of ending the
relationship.

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:52.670
This is firing and this is
continuing.

01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:59.489
So let's just work out what
these things are.

01:06:59.489 --> 01:07:05.264
So his temptation to cheat
today: if he cheats today,

01:07:05.264 --> 01:07:09.225
he doesn't get my wage.
But he does run off with my

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:11.639
cash, and he does go and do his
job at the going wage.

01:07:11.639 --> 01:07:15.609
So if he cheats today he gets
2, he stole all my cash,

01:07:15.609 --> 01:07:19.429
and he's going off and working
at the going wage,

01:07:19.429 --> 01:07:29.283
but he doesn't get what I would
have paid him W** if the job was

01:07:29.283 --> 01:07:32.400
well done.
We need this to be less than

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.260
the value of continuing the
relationship.

01:07:34.260 --> 01:07:37.403
Let's do the easy bit first.
What does he get if we end the

01:07:37.403 --> 01:07:39.996
relationship?
He's been fired,

01:07:39.996 --> 01:07:44.920
so he'll just work at the going
wage for ever.

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:54.559
So this is the value of 1 for
ever, or at least until the end

01:07:54.559 --> 01:08:03.010
of the world.
This is the value of what?

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.423
As long as he stayed employed
by me what's he going to get

01:08:05.423 --> 01:08:09.320
paid every period?
What's he going to get paid?

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:26.500
W**.
So the value of W** for ever.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.022
Let me cheat a little bit and
assume that the probability of

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:33.605
some coup happening that ends
our relationship exogenously is

01:08:33.605 --> 01:08:37.426
the same probability of the coup
happening and ending his ongoing

01:08:37.426 --> 01:08:40.989
wage exogenously,
so we can use the same δ.

01:08:40.989 --> 01:08:44.391
So let's just do some math
here, what's the value of W**

01:08:44.391 --> 01:08:46.434
forever?
So remember the value of 2

01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:49.079
forever was what?
2/[1-δ].

01:08:49.079 --> 01:08:55.619
So what's the value of W**
forever?

01:08:55.619 --> 01:09:01.450
So this is going to be
W**/[1-δ].

01:09:01.450 --> 01:09:11.039
What's the value of 1 forever?
1/[1-δ].

01:09:11.039 --> 01:09:18.789
The whole thing is multiplied
by δ and this is 2-W**.

01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:24.230
Now I need to do some algebra
to solve for W**.

01:09:24.230 --> 01:09:36.880
So let's try and do that.
So I claim that this is the

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:48.395
same as [1--δ]
2--[1--δ]

01:09:48.395 --> 01:09:59.910
W** &lt; W**δ
- δ 1.

01:09:59.910 --> 01:10:03.459
Everyone okay with that?
One more line:

01:10:03.459 --> 01:10:06.090
let me just sort out some terms
here.

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:25.882
So taking these on the other
side, I have [1–δ]

01:10:25.882 --> 01:10:41.508
2 + δ1 &lt;= W**δ
+ [1–δ]

01:10:41.508 --> 01:10:48.016
W** = W**.
So someone should just check my

01:10:48.016 --> 01:10:50.300
algebra at home,
but I think that's right.

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.020
So the last two steps were just
algebra, nothing fancy.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:59.463
What have we learned?
We have learned that the wage I

01:10:59.463 --> 01:11:05.474
have to pay this guy,
the wage I have to pay him lies

01:11:05.474 --> 01:11:12.064
somewhere between 2 and 1,
but we can do a bit better than

01:11:12.064 --> 01:11:13.220
that.

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.220
Let's just delete everything
here.

01:11:24.109 --> 01:11:29.091
So in particular,
if δ = 0,

01:11:29.091 --> 01:11:36.002
what's W**?
If δ = 0,

01:11:36.002 --> 01:11:45.430
W** is equal to what?
Somebody?

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:50.520
Equal to 2 and that's what we
had before.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.996
In the one shot game,
there it is up there,

01:11:53.996 --> 01:11:58.963
where there was no possibility
of continuing the relationship

01:11:58.963 --> 01:12:02.145
tomorrow,
I had to pay him a wage of 2,

01:12:02.145 --> 01:12:05.050
or if you like,
a wage premium of 100%.

01:12:05.050 --> 01:12:08.758
If there's no probability--if
there's no chance of continuing

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:11.601
this relationship,
if δ = 0--we find again

01:12:11.601 --> 01:12:13.950
that I'm paying 100% wage
premium.

01:12:13.950 --> 01:12:17.044
Let's take the other extreme.
If δ = 1,

01:12:17.044 --> 01:12:20.237
so I just know this
relationship's going to

01:12:20.237 --> 01:12:22.289
continue--if δ
= 1,

01:12:22.289 --> 01:12:27.426
so there's no probability of
the world ending or there being

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:32.690
a coup--then what's W**?
It's equal to 1.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:35.570
What's that?
What's 1?

01:12:35.570 --> 01:12:39.060
It's the going wage.
So this is the going wage.

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:43.951
If I know for sure we're going
to continue forever I can get

01:12:43.951 --> 01:12:48.510
away with paying the guy the
going wage, at least in the

01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:52.560
limit.
If we know we're not going to

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.890
continue then I have to play the
one shot wage.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:13:02.940
But let's look at a more
interesting intermediate case.

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:06.601
Suppose δ = ½.
There's just a 1/2

01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:10.416
probability--that's pretty
low--there's 1/2 probability

01:13:10.416 --> 01:13:13.055
that your company,
American Widgets,

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:17.202
is going to stay in Freedonia:
with probability 1/2 it's going

01:13:17.202 --> 01:13:20.721
to be done next period,
with probability 1/2 it's going

01:13:20.721 --> 01:13:23.770
to stay.
What does that do to the wage?

01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:28.955
What happens to the wage in
this case in which there's a

01:13:28.955 --> 01:13:34.800
probability of 1/2 of American
Widgets staying in Freedonia?

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:38.500
It's a 1/2 between 2 and 1,
which is therefore one and a

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:45.794
half½.
Or another way of saying that

01:13:45.794 --> 01:13:54.029
is, the wage premium is now only
50%.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:57.550
What have we learned from this
example?

01:13:57.550 --> 01:14:00.090
Just an example of using
repeated games.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:03.219
Well the first thing we've
learned is it's going to be

01:14:03.219 --> 01:14:06.732
easy, once we get used to it,
it's easy to use this

01:14:06.732 --> 01:14:10.258
technology of comparing
temptations to cheat,

01:14:10.258 --> 01:14:15.145
with values of continuing in a
cooperative relationship versus

01:14:15.145 --> 01:14:21.194
the value of the punishment,
which is in this case was just

01:14:21.194 --> 01:14:24.667
firing the guy.
But more specifically in this

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:28.154
example we've learned that even
a relatively small probability

01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:31.126
of this relationship
continuing--so this is good news

01:14:31.126 --> 01:14:34.556
for those of you who are seniors
and are about to move to San

01:14:34.556 --> 01:14:38.099
Francisco and your significant
other is going to London--even a

01:14:38.099 --> 01:14:40.786
small probability of the
relationship continuing

01:14:40.786 --> 01:14:43.529
drastically reduces the wage
premium.

01:14:43.529 --> 01:14:46.939
The amount you have to "pay"
your significant other not to

01:14:46.939 --> 01:14:50.289
cheat on you as they go off to
London or San Francisco is

01:14:50.289 --> 01:14:53.279
drastically lower if there's
some probability,

01:14:53.279 --> 01:14:56.880
in this case just a ½,
of continuing.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.940
Before you leave,
one more thought okay.

01:14:58.940 --> 01:15:02.066
So how did this all work?
Just to summarize,

01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:07.366
to get good behavior in these
continuing relationships there

01:15:07.366 --> 01:15:12.868
has to be some reward tomorrow.
That reward needs to be higher,

01:15:12.868 --> 01:15:17.213
if the weight you put on
tomorrow, if the probability of

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.819
continuing tomorrow,
is lower.

01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:23.846
The less likely tomorrow is to
occur the bigger that reward has

01:15:23.846 --> 01:15:26.688
to be tomorrow.
We're going to have to charge

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:30.226
wage premia to employ people in
Freedonia but those premiums

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:33.524
will come down once we realize
that we're in established

01:15:33.524 --> 01:15:36.762
relationships in Freedonia--once
the American firms are

01:15:36.762 --> 01:15:40.600
established and not fly by night
operations in Freedonia.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:43.756
Whether that's good news or bad
news for Freedonia we'll leave

01:15:43.756 --> 01:15:47.000

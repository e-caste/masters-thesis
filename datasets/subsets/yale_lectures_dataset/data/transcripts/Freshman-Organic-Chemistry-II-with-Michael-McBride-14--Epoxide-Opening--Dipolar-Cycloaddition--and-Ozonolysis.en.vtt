00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.733
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, more on
addition to alkenes. 

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:07.500
In particular today we're
talking about cycloaddition, 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.733
addition to make rings. 

00:00:08.733 --> 00:00:11.033
So we'll talk more about
epoxides. 

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:14.800
Then ozonolysis and how acetals
play a role in 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.233
ozonolysis. 

00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:20.267
And then we'll get on, I hope,
to transition metal catalysis, 

00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:24.700
hydrogenation and
polymerization. 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.033
So we're talking-- and remember
reaction with 

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.633
alkenes, the reagents are called
electrophilic, but 

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.433
they're nucleophilic as well. 

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.133
And we've talked about these,
and at the end last time we 

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.567
were talking about epoxidation,
which we'll 

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:38.267
continue with now. 

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.333
And then about ozonolysis and
about things attached to 

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.633
metals-- hydrogen attached to
metals, and alkyl groups 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.867
attached to metals. 

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:50.367
So this is where we were last
time. 

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.500
Remember there were a whole
bunch of arrows we drew 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700
happening all at the same time,
although 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.200
not in perfect synchrony. 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.900
Some were a little more
established at the transition 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.467
state than others. 

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:06.100
Now after class I was asked
wouldn't have been simpler to 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.633
abbreviate arrows, as in
textbooks, so you don't draw 

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.400
quite as many arrows. 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.167
I didn't point this out, but
there was a reason I drew so 

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.300
many arrows. 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.633
You might imagine that you could
abbreviate it this way, 

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:23.700
which shows the electrons here
forming a bond, the electrons 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
here going to here to make a
double bond. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.467
This double bond coming down
here to make a single bond. 

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.067
And this bond coming over here.

00:01:30.067 --> 00:01:33.400
That accounts for all the
electron pairs, but it doesn't 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.100
account for them properly, and
the reason it doesn't is some 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.400
of them are pi and some of them
are sigma. 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.467
So it can't be the same electron
pair that's being 

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:48.133
both pi in the plane of the ring
and sigma in the plane of 

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:51.000
the ring, and pi out of the
plane of the ring. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.400
So I accounted for the electrons
differently in 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.367
drawing those arrows as to which
kind was doing what. 

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:02.100
So at the very end last time we
were talking about ethylene 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.500
oxide, how it was a big item of
commerce, 20 million tons a 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.533
year and $20 billion, because of
the 

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:11.500
importance of ethylene glycol. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.300
Then we were going to see how
you get ethylene glycol from 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.133
either base or acid catalysis
with water on ethylene oxide. 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.467
So let's start with base
catalysis. 

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:26.133
Where's it going to attack? 

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.200
Po-Yi, what do you say? 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.600
Where will OH minus attack
ethylene oxide? 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.100
What kind of reaction's going to
happen? 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.100
STUDENT: It will attach onto
hydrogen, CH molecule. 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.200
PROFESSOR: OK, so you want to
take off a proton, is that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.867
right, to attack a hydrogen so
as to remove a proton? 

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.000
Attack sigma* CH, is that
the idea? 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.667
STUDENT: Yeah. 

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.400
PROFESSOR: Now the problem with
that is that the anion 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.600
you get is not at all a good
anion. 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.267
It's a carbon anion. 

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:01.933
The hybridization makes it
better than most carbon 

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:04.233
anions, but not that much
better. 

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:08.700
My guess is its pKa is some
place in the 40s, whereas the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.900
pKa OH minus, or of water to
give OH minus is 16, right-- 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.467
15 and a half. 

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:23.167
So that there's whatever that
is, a 25 powers of 10 

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:23.600
difference. 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.233
So it's going to be very hard to
pull off a proton, even 

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.767
though hydroxide, you're right,
is a strong base-- 

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.567
better as a base than what you
would expect for its 

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:34.233
nucleophilicity. 

00:03:34.233 --> 00:03:36.000
So how about another
possibility? 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.067
If it's not going to be CH
sigma*, what will attack? 

00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:49.233
Now of course, ethylene oxide is
an ether. 

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:52.933
And ethers don't usually undergo
displacement because 

00:03:52.933 --> 00:03:55.067
it's a bad leaving group. 

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.933
O minus is not a great leaving
group, RO minus. 

00:03:58.933 --> 00:04:00.633
But this is a special case. 

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:03.233
Can you see why? 

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.900
Anybody else got an idea? 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.367
Arvind? 

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:07.500
STUDENT: Is it because of the
strain of the-- 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.867
PROFESSOR: High strain, right,
will make that bond weak. 

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:15.833
So, in fact, it is a backside
attack, an SN2 reaction on the 

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:20.167
CO sigma*, which opens the
ring because of the ring 

00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:24.033
strain to give that. 

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:27.367
And now that, of course, picks
up a proton from water, the 

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:31.000
pKa's are essentially the same
for an alcohol and water and 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.033
generates ethylene glycol, the
item of commerce we were 

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:35.467
interested in making. 

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:38.367
Now suppose we're going to do
with H+ catalysis. 

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:39.733
Who's got an idea for that one?

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.000
Rahul, you've got an idea? 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.533
How is H+ going to get into the
act? 

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:47.700
STUDENT: It's a low LUMO so it's
going to be 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.833
attacked by a high HOMO. 

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.100
So the oxygen. 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.733
PROFESSOR: What about oxygen? 

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:56.967
STUDENT: The lone pairs. 

00:04:56.967 --> 00:04:59.333
PROFESSOR: Right, the lone pair
on the oxygen. 

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:01.567
So it'll come down, attack the
lone pair on the 

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:02.900
oxygen to get this. 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.067
And now what do you expect for
the reactivity of this thing? 

00:05:06.067 --> 00:05:08.100
Rahul, keep us going. 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.967
STUDENT: There's still ring
strain, right? 

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:12.967
PROFESSOR: There's still a ring
strain, and you've got a 

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.467
much better leaving group now--

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:15.100
O plus [correction: OH] 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.733
rather than going to become O
minus. 

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.600
So now even water can do it. 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.767
It doesn't have to be hydroxide.

00:05:22.767 --> 00:05:26.267
So we got a great leaving group,
water comes in the does 

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:27.367
the trick, and again, we get it.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:30.400
So either acid or base catalysis
with water will 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.067
convert ethylene oxide into
ethylene glycol. 

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:36.733
But there's another possibility
for a nucleophile 

00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:40.500
in the system, which is this O
minus. 

00:05:43.233 --> 00:05:46.300
So you could imagine it coming
down there and doing the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.167
trick, and now you get another O
minus that can attack again, 

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.367
another O minus that could
attack again. 

00:05:52.367 --> 00:05:56.533
So you can get a whole bunch of
these CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-O's 

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:57.800
strung together. 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.867
So you can get a polyether. 

00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:04.333
There can be as few as three to
call it poly, although 

00:06:04.333 --> 00:06:07.200
often you'd call that oligo,
meaning a few. 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.133
But up to 20,000 units or more
can be strung 

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:12.567
together that way. 

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:16.333
And these things are big items
in commerce as solvents among 

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:16.867
other things. 

00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:21.067
They're also used in toothpaste,
in paintball and 

00:06:21.067 --> 00:06:22.500
lots of different applications.

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:26.567
Here's another application. 

00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:28.333
So you can take the trimer-- 

00:06:28.333 --> 00:06:32.167
that's three of the CH2O's put
together. 

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:33.967
And it's been treated with
potassium 

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:37.900
hydroxide to make the salt. 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.000
And you could treat another one
of the alcohols with one 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.833
of the agents to convert OH into
Cl, like thionyl chloride 

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:48.633
and get a dichloride. 

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:52.500
Can you see what I'm after here?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.800
What kind of reaction do I want
to do? 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.600
Ellen? 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.433
STUDENT: SN2? 

00:06:58.433 --> 00:06:59.200
PROFESSOR: Right, SN2. 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.933
It's a Williamson ether
synthesis, RO minus reacting 

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:07.133
with RCl to make a an O-C bond.

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.800
And what's the product going to
be? 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.500
STUDENT: A crown ether. 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.133
PROFESSOR: Right, that's how
18-crown-6 is made. 

00:07:12.133 --> 00:07:14.933
And in fact, this is what's
called an Org. 

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:15.500
Syn. 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.400
prep. 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.967
Org. 

00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:20.267
Syn. is Organic Syntheses. 

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:22.867
Every year they put out one of
these volumes-- 

00:07:22.867 --> 00:07:26.033
I'll pass around so you can look
at them-- which have 

00:07:26.033 --> 00:07:37.200
various interesting preparations
that have been 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.133
proposed by competent chemists
and tested by them to make 

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.300
sure they work. 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.733
Here's another one, you can send
it back the other way. 

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:51.633
So you can see each of these has
the order of 20 really 

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:58.067
good, careful descriptions with
lots of information about 

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:02.767
exactly how you do it, where you
get the starting 

00:08:02.767 --> 00:08:05.667
materials, and lots and lots of
footnotes. 

00:08:05.667 --> 00:08:09.100
So textbooks don't have time to
do this. 

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.967
And original publications in the
paper often haven't been 

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:14.300
carefully checked. 

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.367
But if you want to see how a
reaction is really carried 

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:20.467
out, this is a very good source
and it tells you 

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.700
exactly what faithful yields
are, not ones that have been 

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.267
exaggerated. 

00:08:26.267 --> 00:08:26.833
And one of the Org. 

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:27.333
Syn. 

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.033
preps is of 18-crown-6. 

00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:33.133
It's interesting, and you might
think about that, that 

00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:37.767
they used the potassium salt,
the potassium hydroxide was 

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:40.900
the one they made the dianion
with. 

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.667
You might think why that might
be. 

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:46.800
Well actually, incidentally, if
you click on that you will 

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:51.567
get this, which is the
description of how to make 

00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:56.600
18-crown-6 on the web from Org.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.200
Syn. 

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.867
So that's how we open ethylene
glycol. 

00:09:02.867 --> 00:09:08.933
Now, notice that if the epoxide
is unsymmetrical-- 

00:09:08.933 --> 00:09:11.500
substituted on one side and not
the other-- 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.767
then there are two different
ways of attacking. 

00:09:13.767 --> 00:09:17.100
For example, in the textbook it
shows that you could attack 

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.667
the less substituted or the more
substituted. 

00:09:19.667 --> 00:09:22.733
And it says in acid the
nucleophile generally becomes 

00:09:22.733 --> 00:09:25.033
attached to the more substituted
carbon. 

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.867
In base the nucleophile
generally becomes attached to 

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:30.633
the less substituted carbon. 

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:33.133
So this is obviously a
generality. 

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:36.700
And one would be interested in
seeing precise data to see 

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.667
just how selective it is. 

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:44.100
So here's an example from the
book where they used sodium 

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:44.633
amide [correction: sodium
azide]. 

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:47.467
So N3 minus is the nucleophile.

00:09:47.467 --> 00:09:51.067
And indeed here, with the anion
attacking it attacks the 

00:09:51.067 --> 00:09:55.167
less substituted, as you would
expect in an SN2, and gives a 

00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:59.200
41% yield of the product from
attacking the 

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.400
less substituted carbon. 

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.867
Now, do you find that then
convincing in terms of in acid 

00:10:05.867 --> 00:10:08.667
you attack one and in base you
attack the other? 

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:09.467
Noah, what do you say? 

00:10:09.467 --> 00:10:14.467
STUDENT: No. 

00:10:14.467 --> 00:10:17.467
41% yield really isn't very much
yield. 

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:17.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah. 

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:20.600
Now of course, you've been in
lab, and I wouldn't be 

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.500
surprised that from time to time
you've been 

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.967
happy with a 41% yield. 

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:25.667
Right? 

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:27.667
So if you really do get 41%-- 

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:29.267
remember we've talked about one
synthesis 

00:10:29.267 --> 00:10:31.267
where 5% was plenty. 

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:33.033
So from a point of preparative--

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:34.667
being able to make the stuff-- 

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:36.800
41% sounds pretty good. 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.133
But if you're interested in does
it really support that 

00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:43.000
generalization, with base
catalysis that is, anion 

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.900
attacking, you attack the less
substituted one, you'd want to 

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.033
know what the other 59% is. 

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:51.333
If the other 59% were attacking
the other carbon 

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.367
that would be bad news for this
generalization. 

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:59.267
So one has to be careful in
reading textbooks, because 

00:10:59.267 --> 00:11:04.833
often references aren't given
about that 41%. 

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:09.367
So here's a generalization that
says that-- here's the 

00:11:09.367 --> 00:11:12.700
other example with acid
catalysis. 

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.233
So it says when you attack with
acid, indeed, the 

00:11:16.233 --> 00:11:19.633
chloride goes more on the more
substituted carbon. 

00:11:19.633 --> 00:11:21.733
That's what the generalization
was. 

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:27.033
But notice that the product
ratio is 55% to 45%. 

00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:30.967
It's not 99:1. 

00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:34.933
It then explains it by saying if
the charge is on the more 

00:11:34.933 --> 00:11:39.567
substituted carbon, that is when
you protonate the O, the 

00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:40.933
bridge is unsymmetrical-- 

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:42.233
we've talked about that-- 

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:45.733
with more charge on the more
substituted carbon so that's 

00:11:45.733 --> 00:11:47.333
the one that gets attacked. 

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.767
"That's where the nucleophile
adds." as it says. 

00:11:49.767 --> 00:11:53.600
But notice that this is a tough
thing to generalize, not 

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.900
a very reliable example to
generalize with, the 55:45. 

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.500
Because that ratio is 10^0.09,
which means that the 

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.400
difference in activation energy
for going one way and 

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.800
going the other at room
temperature is 0.12 

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.900
kilocalories per mole. 

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.100
And you're sophisticated enough
by now to know that 

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.533
that's nothing. 

00:12:19.533 --> 00:12:26.233
That's only 1/25 as big as a
hydrogen bond. 

00:12:26.233 --> 00:12:28.767
So it's true that it gives more
of the more substituted 

00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.033
one in this particular case, but
you wouldn't feel very 

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:34.900
confident in interpreting that.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:38.933
So you might do a calculation to
see what the minimum energy 

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:42.767
geometry is for such a
protonated epoxide. 

00:12:42.767 --> 00:12:46.433
This is not a really high
quality calculation. 

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:50.367
And it's in the gas phase, and,
of course, where a 

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:53.333
solvent is can make a lot more
difference than 0.12 

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:55.300
kilocalories per mole. 

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:57.933
But anyhow, you could look and
see where positive things 

00:12:57.933 --> 00:13:00.967
would like to be or negative
things would like to be on the 

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:03.267
van der Waals surface of this
molecule. 

00:13:03.267 --> 00:13:06.333
So if you look up here at the
top, remarkably enough, when 

00:13:06.333 --> 00:13:10.067
you drew this structure you draw
it O plus-- 

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:13.533
it's a trivalent oxygen, the O
of the three-membered ring has 

00:13:13.533 --> 00:13:14.667
been protonated. 

00:13:14.667 --> 00:13:16.433
So you draw O plus. 

00:13:16.433 --> 00:13:20.667
But notice that this is the
energy a proton would have on 

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:22.667
the surface of that. 

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:29.233
It's high near the oxygen, but
it's 120 kilocalories higher 

00:13:29.233 --> 00:13:30.267
near the hydrogen. 

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:32.933
That's the worst place to put a
positive charge. 

00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:35.900
So it's not what you would draw
if you just put a plus 

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.767
charge on the oxygen. 

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:40.300
So that's the worst place for
H+. 

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.733
It would be the best place for a
negatively charged 

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:44.000
nucleophile. 

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.567
So the best thing would be to
pull the 

00:13:45.567 --> 00:13:48.500
proton back off again. 

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.800
On the other hand, you could, if
you turn the molecule 

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.900
upside-down from the top right
and look at the bottom of it, 

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.567
you see the two carbons that
could be attacked. 

00:13:57.567 --> 00:14:02.467
And at that place, the energy
for the proton would be +140; 

00:14:02.467 --> 00:14:05.600
there it would be +141.5. 

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:10.533
So it's true that it's a little
bit more positive near 

00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:13.800
the central part, near the more
substituted carbon, but 

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.867
not very much. 

00:14:14.867 --> 00:14:17.000
And of course, it's sterically
hindered there. 

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.533
So it seems to be very touchy to
try to interpret this. 

00:14:21.533 --> 00:14:24.667
But still, there are many
examples where it is more 

00:14:24.667 --> 00:14:27.233
dramatic than that. 

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:33.800
Here, for example, are cases
from the textbook where a 

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.167
carbon nucleophile does the
attack. 

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:40.633
Now you notice that when the
phenyl attached to copper 

00:14:40.633 --> 00:14:43.567
attacks so that the polarization
is such that the 

00:14:43.567 --> 00:14:49.300
phenyl is mostly minus, so it's
the nucleophile, although 

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.900
it's really more complicated
because the copper's around at 

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.233
the same time. 

00:14:53.233 --> 00:14:59.067
But notice it attacks backside
and it gives a 98% yield. 

00:14:59.067 --> 00:15:01.600
So that's the kind of thing when
you see it in the book 

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.800
that you can say ah-ha, that's
really something. 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.600
55:45 is not the basis for
confident interpretation. 

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.300
98% is more like it. 

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:16.533
Or in this other example where
it's 85:8 attack at one 

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:20.633
position versus the other with
base catalysis, attacking, as 

00:15:20.633 --> 00:15:25.300
the generalization had said, at
the less substituted carbon 

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.533
to give the 85% product. 

00:15:27.533 --> 00:15:29.967
So there are plenty of examples
that support this 

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:33.300
generalization, but it's not
always reliable. 

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.333
It's important to be critical in
looking at the evidence 

00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:40.667
that people provide to support
their generalizations. 

00:15:40.667 --> 00:15:43.267
So that one shows
stereospecificity. 

00:15:43.267 --> 00:15:46.900
The other one shows
regiospecificity, and much 

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.633
more impressive than that 55:45
example; 85:8 is much 

00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:55.133
more practical for synthesis
purposes and much more 

00:15:55.133 --> 00:15:59.233
convincing for interpretation
purposes. 

00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:02.667
So that much for the epoxides. 

00:16:02.667 --> 00:16:06.800
Now onto ozonolysis, which takes
us into other examples 

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.200
of cycloaddition. 

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.133
Of course, forming the epoxide
is a three-membered ring, so 

00:16:12.133 --> 00:16:15.100
it is a cycloaddition that forms
a ring. 

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:19.800
But ozone is more interesting
because it's three atoms. So 

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:25.867
we can imagine this shift of
electron pairs, perhaps 

00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:28.233
happening all at the same time,
to make a 

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:31.367
five-membered ring. 

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:35.400
And on the left is the
arrangement of those atoms in 

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.133
the transition state, as 

00:16:37.133 --> 00:16:41.267
calculated by quantum mechanics.

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:47.800
So we could look at the motion
along the reaction coordinate, 

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.667
both face on here, the side
view, as I said, and 

00:16:51.667 --> 00:16:53.300
also the end view. 

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:58.367
Notice that O3 is bent so that
the central oxygen is not as 

00:16:58.367 --> 00:17:01.100
near the carbons being attacked
as the terminal 

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.967
oxygens are. 

00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:05.033
So now watch, and we'll watch it
move. 

00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:07.733
So the oxygens move down, the
carbons move up 

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:08.700
and form the bond. 

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.467
We'll reverse it and go back and
forth several times. 

00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:13.433
So you can see it's another one
of these cases where it 

00:17:13.433 --> 00:17:17.167
looks like the attacking group
is rotating down toward the 

00:17:17.167 --> 00:17:18.900
carbon as the carbon moves up. 

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.200
So notice everything is
happening at the same time. 

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.867
It's not that you form one bond
and then the other bond. 

00:17:29.433 --> 00:17:32.167
So let's look at the orbitals
that are involved in making 

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:34.967
two new bonds at the same time,
so there must be two 

00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:37.533
electron pairs that are
involved. 

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:45.167
So there we have the LUMO on O3,
and the HOMO on ethylene. 

00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:49.100
Remember that that central
oxygen up on top is not 

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.267
getting into the act, it's back
behind the screen. 

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:55.000
So you see the two reds with the
LUMO on top are in 

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.733
position to make good overlap. 

00:17:56.733 --> 00:18:01.100
And then give this orbital at
the transition state, 

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:01.933
which is the HOMO-- 

00:18:01.933 --> 00:18:04.467
those overlapping with one
another-- 

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.567
to be bonding, and that's one
electron pair. 

00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:08.667
So that would account for one
bond. 

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:12.000
But by the same token you have
the LUMO of the alkene on the 

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
bottom right interacting with
the HOMO of O3 up on top. 

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.367
And those overlap well and give
the HOMO-1. 

00:18:19.367 --> 00:18:23.700
So another pair of electrons
gets stabilized as these atoms 

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:24.633
come together. 

00:18:24.633 --> 00:18:27.067
So two electron pairs get
stabilized, 

00:18:27.067 --> 00:18:29.933
two bonds are formed. 

00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:35.600
Now this is cycloaddition of
allylic 1,3-dipole to alkenes. 

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.200
There are other examples besides
ozone. 

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.700
Now a 1,3-dipole is a thing like
ozone. 

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.300
You may remember that in the
third lecture, way back at the 

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:47.267
beginning of the fall, we talked
about drawing valence 

00:18:47.267 --> 00:18:51.200
structures for ozone, and the
fact that the lowest energy 

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.700
structure is not a
three-membered 

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.667
ring, but an open form. 

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.933
The interesting thing about it
is when you draw Lewis 

00:18:57.933 --> 00:19:01.700
structures you can't draw a
structure that doesn't have 

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.500
charges or free radicals on the
atoms. So those examples 

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.467
are shown there. 

00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:10.333
So these things are called
1,3-dipoles. 

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:13.833
There are three atoms in a row
and all the structures you can 

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:15.200
draw are dipolar. 

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.433
But that's not the only example.

00:19:18.433 --> 00:19:21.800
Here on an exam from several
years ago, I asked the 

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.633
question saying, "Having learned
that the allylic pi 

00:19:24.633 --> 00:19:26.467
system of O3"-- 

00:19:26.467 --> 00:19:29.767
remember, allylic means three p
orbitals overlapping in a 

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:33.467
row, that's allylic and that's,
obviously, the case 

00:19:33.467 --> 00:19:34.600
with ozone. 

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.767
So, "Having learned that allylic
pi system of ozone 

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:41.433
forms two bonds at once to an
alkene, as shown" bottom left 

00:19:41.433 --> 00:19:44.267
there, "one might think to try
the same thing with the 

00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.000
apparently analogous boron
compound." 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.133
I'm not actually confident that
that molecule 

00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:50.967
exists, but it might. 

00:19:50.967 --> 00:19:53.633
"Explain in terms of the
orbitals involved why this 

00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:54.633
might not" work. 

00:19:54.633 --> 00:19:55.967
It looks like the same thing. 

00:19:55.967 --> 00:20:00.167
You have a 1,3-dipole on the
right, and we draw curved 

00:20:00.167 --> 00:20:03.933
arrows to make the two new
bonds, we have a 1,3-dipole on 

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:07.300
the left and we draw curved
arrows to make the new bonds. 

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.300
But why wouldn't the one on the
right work? 

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.933
Let's try to do a theoretical
analysis of that. 

00:20:13.933 --> 00:20:16.767
So here's ozone viewed from the
top. 

00:20:16.767 --> 00:20:22.967
Now if we rotate this central
oxygen at the top back to see 

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:26.633
the p orbitals we see that there
are three p orbitals in 

00:20:26.633 --> 00:20:29.433
a row, an allylic system. 

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:35.867
The lowest-energy pi orbital
then will have them all 

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:38.267
overlapping favorably with one
another. 

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:41.900
That will be Psi-1, the lowest-
energy pi orbital. 

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.100
It has no antibonding node. 

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.267
And the middle atomic orbital
will be largest. We can choose 

00:20:48.267 --> 00:20:52.267
the size of the p orbitals of
the three. 

00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:54.933
There's an advantage to making
the one-- 

00:20:54.933 --> 00:20:58.000
the sum of their squares has to
be one. 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.833
What do you call that condition,
you remember? 

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.267
STUDENT: Nomalization. 

00:21:02.267 --> 00:21:03.700
PROFESSOR: Normalization, right.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.933
That the electron has to be
somewhere with the total 

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.267
probability of one. 

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:11.967
So the sum of the squares has to
be one, but they don't have 

00:21:11.967 --> 00:21:13.667
to be the same size. 

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:16.133
Symmetry would suggest that the
two ends should be the 

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:19.233
same size, but the one in the
middle could 

00:21:19.233 --> 00:21:20.800
be smaller or bigger. 

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.967
And I say that it's a little bit
bigger. 

00:21:22.967 --> 00:21:25.067
Why should it be bigger? 

00:21:25.067 --> 00:21:28.633
Why do you get advantage by
having the one in the middle 

00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:32.567
big compared to the ones at the
end, if the sum of their 

00:21:32.567 --> 00:21:35.567
squares is fixed? 

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.000
What you want to get is bonding,
overlap. 

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.633
So the bigger the orbitals the
more overlap. 

00:21:45.633 --> 00:21:47.433
What's special about the one in
the middle? 

00:21:47.433 --> 00:21:48.933
Why do you want to make it
bigger? 

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:49.300
Lauren? 

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.133
STUDENT: Because it's bonded to
two of them? 

00:21:51.133 --> 00:21:52.500
PROFESSOR: It overlaps twice. 

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.933
Good. 

00:21:58.633 --> 00:22:01.300
So then the next one has a node
in the middle-- that 

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:02.833
doesn't surprise you. 

00:22:02.833 --> 00:22:05.833
And the highest one has two
nodes. 

00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:13.167
Now, I'm confused by this
because starting with three 

00:22:13.167 --> 00:22:17.033
atomic orbitals and making three
molecular orbitals, you 

00:22:17.033 --> 00:22:20.967
have to use up the three atomic
orbitals. 

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:23.733
If you have more in one place
there has to be less in some 

00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:24.833
place else. 

00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:28.500
Obviously, there's none on the
middle oxygen in the one that 

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:29.800
has no node. 

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.533
That means that the others have
to have more of that and 

00:22:32.533 --> 00:22:34.300
less of what's on the end. 

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.767
It doesn't appear that way in
this picture. 

00:22:36.767 --> 00:22:39.800
It doesn't appear that the
central one is big. 

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.267
But, in fact, it has to be, and
I think this is some 

00:22:44.267 --> 00:22:48.533
artifact of the particular
contour that's been chosen, 

00:22:48.533 --> 00:22:50.767
and I can't really explain it. 

00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:56.167
But in general, the favorable
one, Psi-1, is as favorable as 

00:22:56.167 --> 00:22:58.367
it can be, big in the middle. 

00:22:58.367 --> 00:23:02.500
The second one with the node in
the middle is obviously 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.633
50:50 on the two ends. 

00:23:04.633 --> 00:23:07.733
And the top one will be big in
the middle to be as 

00:23:07.733 --> 00:23:11.000
antibonding as it can be. 

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.433
When they were good they were
very, very good. 

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:16.433
And when they were bad they were
horrid. 

00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:19.533
That's the way it works out. 

00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:22.567
So those are the three molecular
orbitals we're going 

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.633
to be dealing with. 

00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:29.900
Now if you take another allylic
system like CH2BHCH2, 

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:35.533
the one we were talking about,
we can look at its p orbitals 

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:42.533
and there's Psi-1 and there's
Psi-2 and there's Psi-3, and 

00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:45.000
this one does, indeed, show
biggest in the middle, so 

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.733
that's satisfying. 

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:51.300
Of course, boron is less
electronegative than carbon, 

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.867
less nuclear charge. 

00:23:52.867 --> 00:23:56.767
So you would expect the lowest
orbital not to have so much of 

00:23:56.767 --> 00:24:00.100
it, and the highest orbital to
have a lot of the less 

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.867
favorable orbital. 

00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:08.333
Now if we look at a third
example, carbonyloxide, which 

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:14.067
you notice is a carbonyl
compound, H2CO, formaldehyde, 

00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:16.200
with an extra oxygen on it. 

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.767
And that turns out also to be a
1,3-dipole to be bent in the 

00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:21.200
structure shown. 

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.067
And now it's not symmetrical end
to end. 

00:24:24.067 --> 00:24:27.633
So we see the same orbitals, but
they're distorted. 

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:34.033
This one looks mostly like the C
double bond O, pi, but a 

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:38.767
little bit of the oxygen on the
end. 

00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:43.300
That one has a node in it, and
that one is mostly the 

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.133
antibonding pi* of carbonyl
with a little bit of 

00:24:47.133 --> 00:24:49.033
the oxygen on the end. 

00:24:49.033 --> 00:24:51.500
Now why should it be that way? 

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.667
Well notice that the carbon is
much closer to the central 

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:59.667
oxygen than the central oxygen
is to the terminal oxygen. 

00:24:59.667 --> 00:25:02.233
So the big interaction will be
between carbon 

00:25:02.233 --> 00:25:04.133
and the central oxygen. 

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:07.800
So we could first look at the
interaction between carbon and 

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.367
the central oxygen, and then
look at the interaction of 

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:15.300
that, whatever we get from that
with the terminal oxygen, 

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.200
because we'll look at the
strongest interaction first 

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.733
and then at the weaker one. 

00:25:19.733 --> 00:25:26.133
So that says what I just said,
and it will make pi and 

00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:28.200
pi* out of that. 

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:32.667
Now we're going to mix p-O, the
terminal oxygen, with pi 

00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:33.933
and pi*. 

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:40.433
And we see it's closer to the pi
than to the pi* so we 

00:25:40.433 --> 00:25:44.000
get three new ones that look
like that. 

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.600
There's less mixing at the top,
more mixing at the 

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.500
bottom, a better energy match. 

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.467
But Psi-1 still looks mostly
like the 

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:54.367
lower energy one, pi-CO. 

00:25:54.367 --> 00:25:58.833
The pi* looks mostly like
pi* of CO. 

00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:02.333
And this one looks mostly like
the terminal oxygen. 

00:26:02.333 --> 00:26:05.467
That's just to show that the
orbitals are reasonable. 

00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:08.133
So that's big on pi and a little
bit of 

00:26:08.133 --> 00:26:10.433
the terminal oxygen. 

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:11.900
That's that one. 

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.667
Then you have one that's mostly
the terminal oxygen. 

00:26:15.667 --> 00:26:17.267
Then you have one that's mostly
pi*. 

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:21.967
Good. 

00:26:21.967 --> 00:26:25.867
Now let's look at how many pi
electrons we put in to these 

00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:29.400
systems. So we have to count
electrons. 

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:33.233
So here we have three oxygens,
there are the sigma bonds, but 

00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:37.267
also unpaired electrons that are
sigma, in the plane 

00:26:37.267 --> 00:26:39.500
of the three O's. 

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.900
And there are also then, if we
count up, electrons on the 

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.100
terminal oxygens-- 

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:47.100
there's one more electron on
each of the terminal oxygens, 

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.567
and two on the central oxygen. 

00:26:49.567 --> 00:26:54.433
So there are four electrons in
the pi system. 

00:26:54.433 --> 00:26:59.200
So in these pi orbitals we have
to put in four electrons. 

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.300
So that's two pairs, and they go
into the lowest two 

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.667
orbitals, of course. 

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.867
So the HOMO is the middle
orbital, the 

00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:09.500
one with the node. 

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:14.067
And the LUMO is the one with two
nodes. 

00:27:14.067 --> 00:27:16.767
Now suppose we're going to take
ozone and 

00:27:16.767 --> 00:27:20.300
react it with an alkene. 

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:23.267
So we bring an alkene up, and
remember it touches the two 

00:27:23.267 --> 00:27:25.967
oxygens on the end, the ones in
front, not the one that's 

00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:27.300
behind the screen. 

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.567
So that'll make a nice bond,
nice bonding interaction. 

00:27:32.567 --> 00:27:37.767
So the symmetry matches and we
get stabilization of one pair 

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:38.900
of electrons. 

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:44.633
But if we take the HOMO of the
alkene, it mixes with the LUMO 

00:27:44.633 --> 00:27:45.867
of the ozone. 

00:27:45.867 --> 00:27:49.800
So another pair of electrons
gets stabilized, and we make 

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.033
two bonds at the same time and
make the five-membered ring. 

00:27:53.033 --> 00:27:55.767
So that's fine. 

00:27:55.767 --> 00:27:58.800
And as I said here, don't worry
about the oxygen in the 

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.667
center, it doesn't overlap
because 

00:28:00.667 --> 00:28:02.567
it's behind the screen. 

00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:07.800
Now let's go over to look at the
carbonyl oxide and count 

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:08.800
its electrons. 

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.600
So that's the sigma electrons,
and in the pi there's one from 

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.667
carbon, one from oxygen, and two
from the terminal oxygen. 

00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:20.567
So again, there are four
electrons, which means we're 

00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:22.400
going to occupy those two. 

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.400
And again, the HOMO is going to
be the one with one node, 

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.400
and the LUMO the one with two
nodes. 

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:32.367
And when we bring the alkene up
it's going to do its trick. 

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:33.400
So that's fine, too. 

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:36.400
That'll form a five-membered
ring. 

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.067
Now let's look at the other one,
the one that has boron in 

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:40.667
the center. 

00:28:40.667 --> 00:28:43.333
So that one made two bonds. 

00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:47.200
Now the one with boron in the
center has just those two pi 

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:47.767
electrons-- 

00:28:47.767 --> 00:28:51.400
the boron's not contributing
anything. 

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:54.333
So we have only two pi electrons
and we occupy only 

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:56.100
the lowest of these orbitals. 

00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:00.533
So it's the HOMO and the middle
one is the LUMO. 

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:03.867
Now you see when you bring
alkene in, it doesn't do the 

00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:08.567
same thing, because the HOMO of
the alkene looks just like 

00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:10.900
this and they're repulsive with
one another. 

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.833
And the LUMO of the alkene looks
pretty much like this. 

00:29:13.833 --> 00:29:17.833
So it's HOMO with HOMO, LUMO
with LUMO to give overlap, and 

00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:21.333
nothing gets stabilized, it's
repulsive. 

00:29:21.333 --> 00:29:23.733
So that one won't do the trick.

00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:27.500
There's no alkene-HOMO match
with that LUMO, and no 

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:30.633
alkene-LUMO match with that
HOMO. 

00:29:30.633 --> 00:29:33.667
So the ones on the end will do
cycloadditions and give a 

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:37.000
five-membered ring, but that one
with boron in the middle 

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.133
won't because of how many pi
electrons it has. 

00:29:41.133 --> 00:29:44.167
So you can't make two bonds
simultaneously for 

00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:46.900
cycloaddition to the alkene of
that hypothetical compound. 

00:29:52.533 --> 00:29:56.233
Are there any questions about
that? 

00:29:56.233 --> 00:29:59.633
Does it seem unutterably
complicated? 

00:29:59.633 --> 00:30:00.867
Then review it. 

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.533
So let's look at what happens
then in the process of 

00:30:07.533 --> 00:30:08.800
ozonolysis. 

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:13.033
Incidentally, that name, the
lysis part means a loosening 

00:30:13.033 --> 00:30:14.667
or a breaking apart. 

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.767
It seems a funny name, doesn't
it, for a cycloaddition which 

00:30:17.767 --> 00:30:20.467
is clearly bringing things
together. 

00:30:20.467 --> 00:30:21.800
But you'll see in a second what

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.733
happens, it's pretty neat. 

00:30:24.733 --> 00:30:28.067
So we bring alkene in and make
those two new bonds by 

00:30:28.067 --> 00:30:31.467
shifting the orbitals, as we
just were describing. 

00:30:31.467 --> 00:30:34.200
So we get this five-membered
ring. 

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.600
But this isn't so stable. 

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.367
Why is it not stable? 

00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:39.500
Wojciech, you got an idea? 

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.600
STUDENT: All HOMOs. 

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, two oxygens in
a row of peroxide is bad. 

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.600
Three oxygens in a row must be
even worse. 

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.900
Remember what makes two oxygens
in a row bad? 

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:52.733
STUDENT: Lone pairs. 

00:30:52.733 --> 00:30:54.000
PROFESSOR: The lone pairs
repelling. 

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.200
And in this case, we've got--
this compound is called a 

00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.067
molozonide, if you have to give
it a name. 

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:03.100
But it's unstable because of the
mixing of these HOMOs with 

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.900
one another, the unshared pairs.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.200
So that's really bad. 

00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.100
So it breaks apart. 

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.433
Of course, it could break apart
just the way it formed. 

00:31:11.433 --> 00:31:14.667
But in fact, it breaks apart a
different way. 

00:31:14.667 --> 00:31:21.533
It draws these curved arrows,
which is the same kind of 

00:31:21.533 --> 00:31:24.800
thing we formed it with, but
we're breaking different bonds 

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.333
from the one we formed. 

00:31:26.333 --> 00:31:30.467
We formed this bond and this
bond, and now we're breaking 

00:31:30.467 --> 00:31:33.633
this bond and this bond. 

00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:35.700
So it undergoes a reverse of the
previous 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.200
process to give that. 

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:42.767
So that's an aldehyde, plus this
carbonyl oxide that we 

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:46.400
saw on just the previous slide,
a 1,3-dipole. 

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.967
But the carbonyl oxide can do a
cycloaddition. 

00:31:48.967 --> 00:31:51.567
So it could reverse this, but it
wouldn't because the 

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:53.333
product would be unstable. 

00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:55.833
Do you see how to reverse it and
make the product more 

00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:58.667
stable where you don't have
three oxygens in a row? 

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.133
Anybody got an idea? 

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:09.467
How could you make the
cycloaddition go, of the 

00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:12.867
1,3-dipole to the double bond,
and not have three 

00:32:12.867 --> 00:32:14.100
oxygens in a row? 

00:32:20.667 --> 00:32:21.067
Elisa? 

00:32:21.067 --> 00:32:24.000
STUDENT: You'd use the thing you
just formed... 

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
PROFESSOR: Can't hear you. 

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.700
STUDENT: Use what you just
formed instead 

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.967
of the three O's? 

00:32:29.967 --> 00:32:32.067
PROFESSOR: Use what you just
formed instead of the three 

00:32:32.067 --> 00:32:34.600
O's, I'm not quite sure what you
mean. 

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:38.733
STUDENT: You react to the CH2-OO
to make the ring. 

00:32:38.733 --> 00:32:39.200
PROFESSOR: Aha. 

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.967
React the CH2 with O. In other
words, you could turn that 

00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:48.767
molecule over and now do the
cycloaddition and you'd get 

00:32:48.767 --> 00:32:52.300
this form, which only has two
oxygens in a row. 

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.667
That's the product that you
actually get by reacting O3 

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:59.900
with the alkene. 

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:04.333
Now this ozonide, as it's
called-- remember that first 

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:07.200
one with three oxygens in a row
was called a molozonide, 

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.967
this one's called an ozonide. 

00:33:08.967 --> 00:33:11.567
That's not so fantastically
important, but it's 

00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:13.200
what they call them. 

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:17.900
This I call here a double
acetal. 

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:23.067
Now an acetal is a carbon that
has two oxygens on it, two 

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.433
ether oxygens. 

00:33:24.433 --> 00:33:29.067
So you've got that one, but you
also have that one, so 

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:30.300
it's a double acetal. 

00:33:33.133 --> 00:33:37.633
You can hydrolyze acetals with
acid. 

00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:40.033
So we're going to go through and
figure out the mechanism 

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:42.767
of that as another practice in
using curved arrows. 

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.100
So Natalie, I want you to start
us. 

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.767
It's acid catalyzed. 

00:33:50.767 --> 00:33:52.900
So what's going to be the very
first step? 

00:33:52.900 --> 00:34:02.200
STUDENT: To introduce your
proton, and your proton is the 

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.567
LUMO, and so and your lone pair
on the oxygen-- 

00:34:06.567 --> 00:34:07.033
PROFESSOR: OK. 

00:34:07.033 --> 00:34:09.333
So the proton will attack an
unshared pair on the oxygen. 

00:34:09.333 --> 00:34:11.267
Good. 

00:34:11.267 --> 00:34:13.567
Now what's our goal? 

00:34:13.567 --> 00:34:16.000
They'll be lots of different
things we can do as we go 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.600
along, but as we try to
formulate a mechanism, it's 

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.467
important to remember what kind
of thing 

00:34:21.467 --> 00:34:22.867
we're trying to do. 

00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:26.500
And the kind of thing we're
aiming toward is to remove RO 

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.100
and replace it with HO. 

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.367
That's the goal of the first
step. 

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.267
So you got us started well. 

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:38.433
We take a proton, come down and
attack the unshared pair 

00:34:38.433 --> 00:34:39.733
and we get that. 

00:34:39.733 --> 00:34:41.000
Now what's the next step? 

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.633
Natalie, can you help us some
more? 

00:34:42.633 --> 00:34:49.100
STUDENT: You have your hold the
positive charge on the 

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.133
oxygen is your HOMO. 

00:34:51.133 --> 00:34:53.700
PROFESSOR: Now the positive
charge, remember, makes a 

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.167
HOMO, makes orbitals be high,
[correction: low] in energy. 

00:34:57.167 --> 00:34:59.933
But the positive charge is not
an 

00:34:59.933 --> 00:35:03.267
orbital, it's just a charge. 

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:10.367
What particular electrons or
what particular vacant orbital 

00:35:10.367 --> 00:35:11.167
would that be? 

00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:12.400
We want a low vacant orbital. 

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.900
The plus charge will lower
orbitals. 

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:17.933
What's the low orbital that
we're going for? 

00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:19.867
STUDENT: pi*. 

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:21.600
PROFESSOR: There aren't any pi
electrons in 

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.867
this, no double bonds. 

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:25.933
STUDENT:sigma*. 

00:35:25.933 --> 00:35:26.167
PROFESSOR: sigma*. 

00:35:26.167 --> 00:35:27.400
So the CO sigma*. 

00:35:31.033 --> 00:35:31.967
So we can do this. 

00:35:31.967 --> 00:35:35.600
Have you ever seen a reaction
like that before? 

00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.667
Where a leaving group leaves and
leaves a cation? 

00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:42.467
Anybody seen a reaction like
that? 

00:35:42.467 --> 00:35:42.933
Alex? 

00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:44.900
STUDENT: SN1. 

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.133
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:35:45.133 --> 00:35:48.400
That's an SN1 reaction where the
leaving group leaves-- we 

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.100
made it a good leaving group by
putting the 

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.000
positive charge on there. 

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.800
Now that's a primary cation. 

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:02.467
That doesn't look like a very
good candidate for SN1. 

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:05.533
Alex, do you see any reason why
SN1 might be feasible? 

00:36:05.533 --> 00:36:08.600
Why that cation might be better
than you would imagine? 

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.200
I could tell you a reason why
it's bad. 

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.633
Oxygen is electron withdrawing--

00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:15.800
right, high nuclear charge. 

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.533
So it tends not to let cations
form. 

00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:20.833
It pulls electrons. 

00:36:20.833 --> 00:36:22.100
Why is that a good cation? 

00:36:27.733 --> 00:36:28.967
Anybody else got a suggestion? 

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:34.400
Debby? 

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:37.067
STUDENT: The electrons on the O
are stabilized. 

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:39.267
PROFESSOR: The electrons of the
adjacent oxygen get 

00:36:39.267 --> 00:36:40.300
stabilized. 

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.067
The unshared pair on the oxygen
get stabilized. 

00:36:43.067 --> 00:36:44.800
We can draw that resonance
structure. 

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:48.833
So it is an unusually stable
cation, not because C+ is 

00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:52.800
stable, but because that low
vacant orbital stabilizes the 

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.600
oxygen electrons next door. 

00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:57.500
So we get that cation. 

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.167
And now we have-- it's
hydrolysis. 

00:37:00.167 --> 00:37:05.400
So water is going to get into
the act, form a new bond, and 

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.000
we have this. 

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.667
And we've done what we wanted to
do here. 

00:37:07.667 --> 00:37:11.933
Remove RO and replace it with
OH. 

00:37:11.933 --> 00:37:14.767
Of course, we replaced it with
H2O, but that's no problem, we 

00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:18.867
could lose the proton to another
water molecule. 

00:37:18.867 --> 00:37:22.367
So we've done the first step
here. 

00:37:22.367 --> 00:37:26.800
We have what's called a half
acetal, a hemiacetal. 

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.100
Remember an acetal had two RO
groups attached to CH2. 

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.867
Now we only have one, the other
is OH, a hemiacetal. 

00:37:34.867 --> 00:37:39.267
Now this whole process here, if
you had to give it a name, 

00:37:39.267 --> 00:37:42.567
a mechanistic name, what would
you call it Alex? 

00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:44.000
SN1. 

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:44.833
OK. 

00:37:44.833 --> 00:37:46.400
So it's an SN1 reaction. 

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:53.500
And now the second goal is to
remove the second RO, then a 

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:57.733
proton from OH, and then we're
going to generate 

00:37:57.733 --> 00:37:59.333
a double bond here. 

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:03.567
We're going to get CO double
bond. 

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:06.133
So again, we have acid
catalysis. 

00:38:06.133 --> 00:38:09.033
Where are we going to attack for
this purpose? 

00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:10.000
Ruoyi? 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.167
STUDENT: Attack the oxygen
pi*. 

00:38:13.167 --> 00:38:14.367
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:38:14.367 --> 00:38:18.400
That's the one we want to lose,
so we protonate there. 

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:19.967
Next step, Ruoyi? 

00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:22.833
STUDENT: Lose the alcohol. 

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:23.633
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:26.200
So it's another SN1 kind of
thing 

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:27.967
where we make the cation. 

00:38:27.967 --> 00:38:31.833
And now what's the last step if
we want to lose-- remember, 

00:38:31.833 --> 00:38:37.533
we want to lose H, too, from
here. 

00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:39.300
We just do it, right? 

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:45.000
And what would you call that
process, the one that went 

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.333
from here to here, if you had to
give it a mechanistic name? 

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:50.700
Ruoyi? 

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.600
STUDENT: E1. 

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.900
PROFESSOR: That's E1, right,
formation of the cation. 

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.967
So the process is E1. 

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:58.000
OK, so that did it. 

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.900
What we've done, the overall
transformation is to take 

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:06.133
water plus an acetal, acid
catalysis, and get a carbonyl 

00:39:06.133 --> 00:39:08.600
plus two ROH's-- 

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.167
the one here and the one up
there. 

00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:15.200
So we started with the acetal
and water, and the water comes 

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.300
across and we get two alcohols
and a carbonyl, just by the 

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.000
SN1 and E1 mechanisms that we
just worked through. 

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.733
So that's how you hydrolyze an
acetal. 

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.333
And here's an acetal. 

00:39:30.333 --> 00:39:32.533
The CH2 has two O's in it. 

00:39:32.533 --> 00:39:34.433
So we can hydrolyze it. 

00:39:34.433 --> 00:39:36.167
And we can hydrolyze that one. 

00:39:36.167 --> 00:39:38.267
We can hydrolyze both-- 

00:39:38.267 --> 00:39:41.967
the one on the right and the one
on the left. 

00:39:41.967 --> 00:39:45.400
And you see then what we've
done-- now you see the lysis 

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.567
part, the breaking apart. 

00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:49.500
What was the starting material?

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.333
Where were these carbons in the
starting material, the 

00:39:52.333 --> 00:39:56.067
very early, before we added
ozone? 

00:39:56.067 --> 00:39:59.100
It was an alkene, a C-C double
bond. 

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.233
What we've done is break the C-C
double bond and make two 

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:03.567
C-O double bonds. 

00:40:03.567 --> 00:40:06.500
So that's the lysis part, the
breaking apart. 

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.167
We change a C-C double bond into
two C-O double bonds. 

00:40:10.167 --> 00:40:15.233
But notice that one of the
byproducts is water, the other 

00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:22.633
one is hydrogen peroxide, which
is an oxidizing agent. 

00:40:22.633 --> 00:40:24.867
So it gives two carbonyl
compounds 

00:40:24.867 --> 00:40:26.767
and hydrogen peroxide. 

00:40:26.767 --> 00:40:32.867
But it turns out that hydrogen
peroxide oxidizes aldehydes 

00:40:32.867 --> 00:40:36.267
to carboxylic acids. 

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.433
So this is a problem. 

00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:40.967
You don't just get the two
carbonyls, you also have 

00:40:40.967 --> 00:40:44.133
something that can react with
the aldehyde, the carbonyl. 

00:40:44.133 --> 00:40:48.733
So now, as the book points out,
and any of your books 

00:40:48.733 --> 00:40:53.267
will give this, there are two
ways you can 

00:40:53.267 --> 00:40:54.700
cope with this problem. 

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.367
One is if you want to make the
aldehyde, put something else 

00:40:59.367 --> 00:41:02.467
in that will react with the
hydrogen peroxide 

00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:03.533
to get rid of it. 

00:41:03.533 --> 00:41:06.567
So you use a reducing agent, and
we'll talk shortly about 

00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:08.567
oxidizing and reducing agents. 

00:41:08.567 --> 00:41:12.533
But things like dimethyl sulfide
or zinc, which 

00:41:12.533 --> 00:41:15.100
destroys the HOOH. 

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.033
So the book now gives examples
where you see you could do 

00:41:18.033 --> 00:41:22.000
this, first treat it with ozone
to get the ozonide. 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.800
Then treat it with water, but
with zinc there in order to 

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.867
reduce the hydrogen peroxide. 

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:30.467
And now you get the aldehyde in
93%. 

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:34.700
That's the kind of yield that's
really convincing. 

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.167
Or here's another example where
this one is first 

00:41:37.167 --> 00:41:40.500
ozonized, and then when it's
hydrolized it's treated with 

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.267
the sulfur to get rid of the
hydrogen peroxide, and it 

00:41:43.267 --> 00:41:47.633
gives a 75% yield of this
aldehyde, and also the other 

00:41:47.633 --> 00:41:51.900
one, CH2O from the other side of
the double bond. 

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.300
The other possibility is just go
with the flow. 

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.533
If it's going to oxidize, fine,
put in 

00:41:57.533 --> 00:42:00.267
more oxidizing agent. 

00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:03.367
So there we use the dimethyl
sulfide and there zinc as 

00:42:03.367 --> 00:42:04.733
reducing agents. 

00:42:04.733 --> 00:42:10.500
But if you add more hydrogen
peroxide, as is done here, then

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:14.000
you can make the carboxylic acid
in reasonably good yield, 

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.633
like this one, for example, 85%
yield. 

00:42:17.633 --> 00:42:22.167
So those are the two
possibilities with ozonolysis. 

00:42:22.167 --> 00:42:25.467
You break the CC double bond,
but the carbons could become 

00:42:25.467 --> 00:42:30.567
either carbonyls or carboxylic
acids. 

00:42:30.567 --> 00:42:33.533
Now how does that happen? 

00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:39.700
How does the aldehyde react with
hydrogen peroxide to give 

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.933
carboxylic acid? 

00:42:41.933 --> 00:42:43.733
So let's try another mechanism
here. 

00:42:43.733 --> 00:42:45.467
Derek, you're going to start us
in. 

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:51.233
What's going to react
with what here?

00:42:51.233 --> 00:42:52.367
What's the HOMO, and what's
the LUMO?

00:42:52.367 --> 00:42:54.033
STUDENT: Well, the minus on the
O is a HOMO. 

00:42:54.033 --> 00:42:56.833
PROFESSOR: The minus on the O is
a HOMO. 

00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:58.633
STUDENT: Would this be a double,
like 

00:42:58.633 --> 00:42:59.867
two at the same time? 

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:06.400
PROFESSOR: Let's suppose we
aren't that sophisticated. 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.233
STUDENT: Then C double bond O is
the LUMO. 

00:43:08.233 --> 00:43:10.333
PROFESSOR: C double bond O
pi* is a good example. 

00:43:10.333 --> 00:43:13.400
Where would it attack, the C or
the O? 

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.900
STUDENT: It would attack the C.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.833
PROFESSOR: Attack the C, OK. 

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:19.800
So there we go. 

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.200
That's going to give this. 

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.567
Now, can you think of a second
reaction? 

00:43:24.567 --> 00:43:25.833
Matt, let's go to you. 

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.733
STUDENT: All right. 

00:43:28.733 --> 00:43:30.133
Well, the-- 

00:43:30.133 --> 00:43:31.500
PROFESSOR: Where do we have a
HOMO? 

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.067
STUDENT: You have a HOMO on the
unshared pair on the O. 

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:36.800
PROFESSOR: So here's the HOMO,
where's the LUMO? 

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.467
STUDENT: LUMO would be the OO
sigma*. 

00:43:39.467 --> 00:43:40.933
PROFESSOR: sigma* OO. 

00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:44.700
So we can do an SN2 kind of
reaction, right? 

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:46.400
Like that. 

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.433
That what you had in mind? 

00:43:47.433 --> 00:43:49.200
STUDENT: Yes. 

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:52.333
PROFESSOR: And it's going to
form a three-membered ring 

00:43:52.333 --> 00:43:55.400
with two oxygens next to one
another. 

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.267
That's not so great, because the
oxygen-oxygen's not a 

00:43:58.267 --> 00:44:00.200
strong bond and the
three-membered ring is going 

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:01.133
to be strained. 

00:44:01.133 --> 00:44:03.067
So that was a reasonable idea,
that's why I 

00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:04.200
wrote it that way. 

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.700
But if I had written it a
different way, the OO bond is 

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.367
weak and the three-membered ring
is even 

00:44:10.367 --> 00:44:12.333
worse, so forget that. 

00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:15.100
So I'll write a different
conformation. 

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:16.867
And now this is a neat reaction.

00:44:16.867 --> 00:44:19.767
Again we're going to use
sigma* OO with OH the 

00:44:19.767 --> 00:44:20.533
leaving group. 

00:44:20.533 --> 00:44:23.100
It's a weak bond, OO. 

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.033
But now we're doing something
else. 

00:44:25.033 --> 00:44:27.667
We're taking the electrons from
CH to be 

00:44:27.667 --> 00:44:29.967
the attacking group. 

00:44:29.967 --> 00:44:31.533
So it's a rearrangement. 

00:44:31.533 --> 00:44:33.433
It's a hydride shift. 

00:44:33.433 --> 00:44:37.100
And what pushes the hydride
away, what allows it to do 

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.567
that, is the fact that these
electrons can go in and form a 

00:44:40.567 --> 00:44:44.600
very strong CO double bond at
the same time. 

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.967
And this will remind you, if you
think about it a little 

00:44:46.967 --> 00:44:49.300
bit, of another reaction we
looked at. 

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:54.100
This hydride shift reminds you
of this alkide shift here. 

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.833
Remember when you had B minus it
was possible for these 

00:44:57.833 --> 00:45:00.400
electrons to displace the OO. 

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.233
Remember that's the second step
of the 

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:06.767
hydroboration/oxidation process.

00:45:06.767 --> 00:45:10.200
So it's the same kind of
reaction. 

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.367
So it's a rearrangement, and
that gives the carboxylic 

00:45:14.367 --> 00:45:17.467
acid, but of course, it also
generates hydroxide which 

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:19.633
reacts with the carboxylic acid.

00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:25.433
So that's the stable product is
the carboxylate anion. 

00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:30.200
So that's why when you have
hydrogen peroxide there the 

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:33.400
aldehyde becomes a carboxylic
acid. 

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.067
Now here's a problem for you to
work on. 

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.700
Try doing the same thing-- 

00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.767
here we used base catalysis. 

00:45:41.767 --> 00:45:44.733
Suppose it were acidic
conditions and you had to do 

00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:46.500
it with acidic catalysis. 

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.967
Could you draw a mechanism that
gets to the same place. 

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:52.100
Of course, it would be
protonated, if it's acidic 

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.267
rather than basic. 

00:45:53.267 --> 00:45:55.567
But see if you can put together
a mechanism that's 

00:45:55.567 --> 00:45:57.733
acid catalyzed that does the
same thing. 

00:46:02.233 --> 00:46:07.167
Now we've been talking about
electrophilic additions to 

00:46:07.167 --> 00:46:08.900
carbon-carbon double bonds. 

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:12.167
We talked already last semester
about nucleophilic 

00:46:12.167 --> 00:46:14.833
addition to CO double bonds. 

00:46:14.833 --> 00:46:17.133
So nucleophile versus
electrophile. 

00:46:17.133 --> 00:46:21.533
But remember that the addition
to the carbon-carbon double 

00:46:21.533 --> 00:46:24.767
bond was both electrophilic and
nucleophilic. 

00:46:24.767 --> 00:46:27.667
So it wouldn't be surprising if
the addition to the CO 

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:30.000
double bond is both nucleophilic
and 

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.233
electrophilic. 

00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:34.067
So let's just compare it. 

00:46:34.067 --> 00:46:36.333
So the nucleophilic addition of
methyllithium 

00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:37.867
to a carbonyl group-- 

00:46:37.867 --> 00:46:39.900
and we'll discuss this more when
we're talking about the 

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.700
chemistry of carbonyl groups-- 

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:44.633
is formally quite different
because you add electrophiles 

00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:45.600
to alkenes. 

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:47.967
But this shows you that there's
really quite a 

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:49.067
similarity. 

00:46:49.067 --> 00:46:51.667
So here on top, this is the
transition state for the 

00:46:51.667 --> 00:46:55.200
addition of methyllithium, so
the yellow or orange thing is 

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.600
lithium, and this CH3, of
course, is methyl. 

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.167
So that's it coming down on top
of formaldehyde. 

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:05.700
And that's the transition state.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.600
So what's happening is we're
changing partners here with 

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:16.733
these electron pairs, and going
toward that product. 

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:20.433
So we start with this,
methyllithium and the 

00:47:20.433 --> 00:47:25.200
carbonyl, and there we have a
HOMO, which is the 

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:28.367
lithium-carbon bond, mostly on
carbon-- that doesn't 

00:47:28.367 --> 00:47:29.300
surprise you. 

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.800
But notice that it's well set up
to interact with the 

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.267
pi* of the carbonyl. 

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:38.700
And by the same token here's
LUMO+1, a p orbital on the 

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.667
lithium, a vacant orbital, which
is well set up to 

00:47:41.667 --> 00:47:44.500
overlap with the red part of a
HOMO. 

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:46.967
So again, there are two
electrons that do the trick-- 

00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:50.200
HOMO with LUMO, LUMO with HOMO.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.733
And you get both things
happening at once. 

00:47:52.733 --> 00:47:55.667
And we'll come back and talk
about that more, but I just 

00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:57.833
wanted to show you that it's not
a completely different 

00:47:57.833 --> 00:47:59.300
thing from the addition to
alkenes. 

00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:06.867
Now we're ready to talk about
metals. 

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:09.500
Let me just do a little bit at
the beginning and then we'll 

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.333
go on next time to talk about
more. 

00:48:12.333 --> 00:48:17.600
So osmium textroxide, or
permanganate, is osmium, or 

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.300
manganese minus, in the center
of four oxygens. 

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:26.433
And notice that that looks like
ozone, these three atoms 

00:48:26.433 --> 00:48:29.167
in a row above the two of the
alkene. 

00:48:29.167 --> 00:48:33.900
So there's its HOMO, and it's
well set up to interact with 

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.967
the alkene LUMO. 

00:48:36.967 --> 00:48:40.367
And there's its LUMO, which is
well set up to act with that 

00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:44.500
alkene HOMO, although I seem to
have messed up the 

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:46.600
animation a little bit. 

00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:48.100
So here we can see it happening.

00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:55.100
It gives us osmate ester. 

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.767
Now notice it forms two bonds at
the same time. 

00:48:57.767 --> 00:49:00.933
It's like this 1,3-dipole or
cycloaddition. 

00:49:00.933 --> 00:49:05.067
And that's the osmium analog of
that cyclic acetal that we 

00:49:05.067 --> 00:49:06.433
looked at before. 

00:49:06.433 --> 00:49:10.700
So we can imagine water coming
in and breaking it apart to 

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.567
give a double bond and two OH
groups. 

00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:17.300
So the product then from that
osmate ester of 

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.633
hydrolysis is the diol. 

00:49:19.633 --> 00:49:22.433
So you could make a
carbon-carbon double bond, 

00:49:22.433 --> 00:49:26.167
break this pi bond and put two
OH's on. 

00:49:26.167 --> 00:49:31.000
So osmium tetroxide is a very
good reagent for giving that 

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.200
in high yield. 

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.767
In other respects, it's not such
a great reagent, and 

00:49:35.767 --> 00:49:37.233
we'll talk about that next time.

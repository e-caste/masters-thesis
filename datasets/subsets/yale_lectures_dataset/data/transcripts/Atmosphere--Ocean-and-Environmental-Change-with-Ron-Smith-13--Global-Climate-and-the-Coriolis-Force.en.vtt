RONALD SMITH: Well, so we're 
talking about the

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.367
general circulation
of the atmosphere.

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:10.267
Very important, very
broad subject.

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:15.133
And I'm going to re-hash a
couple of things here, just to

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.767
get us started on
today's lecture.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:22.000
But I did bring us to the point
last time of looking at

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.133
a kind of a textbook cartoon
like this, that outlines in

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.867
very simple form the three cell
circulation model for the

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:33.133
Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.567
You know, in its most
basic form, this is

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:38.867
a very simple problem.

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:42.100
You're just putting more heat
in near the equator, and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.467
taking more heat out near the
pole, and the differential

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.700
heating causes a circulation.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.833
But the nature of that
circulation becomes rather

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:57.467
complicated because, well, of
the spherical geometry of the

00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:02.800
Earth, the fact that the Earth
is spinning, which distributes

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.067
the solar heat pretty well
zonally around the equator,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.567
but then the other big thing
is the Coriolis force.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:12.133
We're going to be talking about
Coriolis force today in

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:15.267
some detail, but for right now,
I'll just mention it as

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:19.067
one of the reasons it gives
rise to this three cell,

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:21.733
rather complex structure.

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:24.633
Now of these three cells, the
one that is the easiest to

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:29.200
see, in day to day weather, in
satellite images, is the

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.000
Hadley cell.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.733
So if you're not going to
memorize everything on this,

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.100
be sure you know the
Hadley cell.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.267
That represents the rising air
near the equator, poleward air

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:45.933
moving aloft, and then sinking
and then returning towards the

00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:50.133
equator at the surface of the
earth in a kind of a symmetric

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:52.300
way around the equator.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.933
We'll see it's a little more
complicated than that, but

00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:56.233
this is a good starting point.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:01.067
It's a double kind of a
circulation pattern driven by

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:05.667
the excess heat put in from
the sun along the equator.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:06.933
That's the Hadley cell.

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:13.467
The Ferrel cell is less easy to
see in the data, and so is

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.267
the Polar cell, but what's
easy to see are these

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:17.700
westerlies.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.033
Here you have easterly flow
near the surface, here

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.800
westerlies, and we'll talk about
that, as well as this

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.733
being the belt of storms, which
I'll define for you in

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:28.100
just a moment.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.967
Now, I showed these last time
but they're so loaded with

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.000
information and detail that
I wanted to say a few

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.567
more words about it.

00:02:35.567 --> 00:02:39.900
What this is, is a composite
of several--

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.233
Let me get my global up
here for a minute.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:47.000
So, the globe is spinning,
of course, like this.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.567
But there are several satellites
in orbit of a type

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:54.433
called geostationary
satellites.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.833
If you put a satellite in orbit,
approximately this far

00:02:58.833 --> 00:03:04.067
from Earth, about 42,000
kilometers, the time it takes

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:10.800
to go once around in its orbit
just happens to be 24 hours.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.900
The time it takes to go around
depends on the radius of that

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.400
orbit, and that particular
radius takes

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.600
24 hours to go around.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.633
Well, if in addition, you've
put that satellite into an

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:27.367
equatorial orbit, and put it in
the pro-grade direction, so

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:31.167
it's moving from west to east,
I think you can see where I'm

00:03:31.167 --> 00:03:35.733
going with this, then as the
Earth spins around, that

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:40.167
satellite stays over
the same point.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:43.867
So, Earth is spinning once every
24 hours, it takes 24

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.167
hours for the satellite to go
around, that's called the

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.600
geostationary satellite.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.400
The beauty of that is, that then
it looks like the Earth

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.300
is just fixed, and you can
see all the cloud motions

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.367
beautifully.

00:03:56.367 --> 00:04:00.367
OK, now you're only seeing one
side of the Earth, but in fact

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:03.433
there are several of these
geostationary satellites in

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:04.867
orbit at the present time.

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:07.800
The United States has two, the
Europeans have one, the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.767
Indians have one, the Japanese
have one, all generally in

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.867
their part of the world.

00:04:13.867 --> 00:04:18.100
And so, you've got multiple
geostationary satellites.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.900
So with a little bit of computer
wizardry, you can

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.933
stitch those movies together,
and make something like this.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.767
Now, as you'll see, there are
an occasional little gap in

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:32.167
the data where something
went wrong.

00:04:32.167 --> 00:04:36.033
The other thing is that
we're not looking

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:38.667
at reflected sunlight.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.333
You would think, well,
the clouds are white.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:42.967
No, we're not looking at
reflected sunlight.

00:04:42.967 --> 00:04:46.800
Notice that the full globe
seems to be illuminated.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.633
How could that be?

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:51.133
There's always a day side and
a night side, so you could

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:52.900
never have a situation
like that.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.167
Well, we're not looking
at reflected sunlight.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:58.700
We're looking at emitted
radiation in the thermal

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.933
infrared, the TIR.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:03.633
The wavelengths being used here
are roughly in the range

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:06.767
of eight to twelve microns.

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:10.367
There happens to be in
atmospheric window there which

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:18.000
allows those photons to move
through the atmosphere without

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.333
being strongly absorbed.

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:23.067
And therefore, what we're seeing
is the intensity of

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:27.700
that radiation emitted by the
earth reaching the satellite.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.733
In the areas where there are
no clouds, we're seeing

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:35.667
radiation emitted from the land,
and the land is hot.

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:39.700
So the radiation is strong.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.033
In other areas where there
are high clouds, those

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.033
cloud tops are cold.

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:49.500
They emit less intensely,
and we show that

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.167
with kind of a false--

00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:55.633
Notice we've kind of inverted
the color scheme.

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:59.233
It's actually the radiation
coming from here is large, the

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:02.100
radiation coming from there is
small, but we're-- we've coded

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.767
this as white and this as black,
in order to make it

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:10.067
look a little bit like reflected
sunlight, so the

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:10.900
clouds look white.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.733
So we're trying to play a trick
on you, or all of us, by

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:19.933
coding that emitted radiation
to make it look a little bit

00:06:19.933 --> 00:06:23.567
like clouds are white and land
is dark and ocean is dark.

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:25.267
So don't be fooled
by that, this is

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:26.333
really emitted radiation.

00:06:26.333 --> 00:06:32.233
So it's a temperature map, but
we can easily find these high

00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.333
clouds because they are higher
up in the troposphere.

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:37.867
Remember, it gets colder as
you go up, so those high

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:40.200
clouds have a colder
temperature

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.967
and they emit less.

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.500
There's no doubt that these
are clouds all right, but

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.400
we're seeing them because they
emit less radiation.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.267
Any questions on that?

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:58.033
So then when I put this into
motion, I want you to watch

00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:01.033
for various things here.

00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:05.200
I think I'll start it
and then stop it.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:12.067
So you're seeing clouds
generally along in the

00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:14.500
equatorial region.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.100
These are high, deep, convective
clouds with heavy

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.067
rain under them, and they're
generally moving from east to

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.833
west. We'll see in just a minute
that they're moving

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:28.633
along with the easterly trade
winds in those latitudes.

00:07:28.633 --> 00:07:30.100
Whereas in--

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.633
down here and up here, you're
seeing these comma shaped

00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:38.133
clouds, notice they're upside
down in the south, so the

00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:43.500
commas look like this in the
north, but they're kind of

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.633
reversed in the south.

00:07:45.633 --> 00:07:49.067
We'll see later today that has
to do with the flip in the

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:51.800
sign of the Coriolis force.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.500
And they're generally moving
from west to east because this

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.767
is a belt of westerlies.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:59.100
Westerly winds, or winds moving
from west to east, and

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.000
they're carrying those
storms eastward.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.033
In between, there are belts
where there are

00:08:04.033 --> 00:08:08.500
fewer clouds, and that--

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.833
fewer clouds, of course, means
less rain as well, so this

00:08:11.833 --> 00:08:14.100
happens to be the belt of
deserts, for example, the

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:18.433
Sahara Desert lies in that
range, and so does some

00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:22.000
deserts in Argentina,
and Africa, and

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.900
Australia, and so on.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.767
So we're going to be spending a
lot of time on understanding

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:30.133
the distribution of climate
around the globe, but here's

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:33.600
our first hint at how this whole
system works, when we're

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.400
studying the general
circulation.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.133
So let me finish up this
little film loop.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:48.200
And then I'll move on to the
next, which is very similar,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.767
except it's taken in a
different wavelength.

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:57.100
Instead of near 10 microns, it's
about 6.7 microns, which

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.333
is not a window.

00:08:59.333 --> 00:09:02.067
It's not a wavelength for
which the atmosphere is

00:09:02.067 --> 00:09:03.000
transparent.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.533
It's actually a wavelength
for which the

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:06.833
atmosphere is rather opaque.

00:09:06.833 --> 00:09:10.067
It's opaque because water
vapor absorbs at that

00:09:10.067 --> 00:09:10.933
particular wavelength.

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:14.867
So we call this a water vapor
image, because the radiation

00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:18.667
you're seeing there is coming
from water vapor molecules in

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.300
the atmosphere.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.600
I think they look really cool,
because you start to see, it

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.067
looks like you're making some
kind of a cake, and you're

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:29.500
stirring the chocolate
in with the vanilla.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.733
You see the dry and the moist
air kind of being mixed in

00:09:33.733 --> 00:09:37.800
together in these mid latitude
frontal cyclones.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.600
You still see the clouds all
right, the clouds show up just

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.167
as they did before, but in
addition you're seeing the

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.500
water vapor that's in and
around those clouds.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.067
And there's a dry zone in the
north and south in these belts

00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:53.933
of deserts, and then there's
moisture, again, down here,

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:56.467
being stirred in both high--

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:59.300
northern and southern
mid-latitudes by

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.167
these frontal cyclones.

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:03.433
Let me put this into motion.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.733
So again, you see the general
sense of motion, east to west

00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:17.600
through here, but west to
east here and here.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.033
I'll finish up that loop.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.733
Any questions on this?

00:10:28.733 --> 00:10:29.333
Yes?

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:32.433
STUDENT: The tropical
rainforest, like in the

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:34.700
Amazon, falls into that area
that you said there aren't

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.133
like that many clouds but how
does it rain so often there?

00:10:36.133 --> 00:10:38.067
PROFESSOR: Well, this is one

00:10:38.067 --> 00:10:39.667
season of the year.

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:44.100
So, this one happens
to be September.

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:50.000
And this belt of cloudiness,
that you see over the oceans

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and then down over the
continents, we call it the

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.233
Intertropical Convergence Zone,
and I'll define it in

00:10:55.233 --> 00:10:58.033
just a moment, but it does move
a little bit with season.

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:02.200
But it is those clouds that
is responsible for the

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.067
rainforests.

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:06.467
But you want to take a look at
the whole year to see when

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.567
it's going to be raining there,
and when it might not

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:09.067
be raining.

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:13.767
So this is only a few days in
September, and it doesn't give

00:11:13.767 --> 00:11:14.633
you the full picture.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:17.167
But we'll talk about the
seasonality of this in a

00:11:17.167 --> 00:11:20.167
couple days, and I think that'll
answer your question.

00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.500
But basically, yes.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.100
The rainforests are connected
with this belt of rain and

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:29.233
cloudiness, but perhaps not at
the exact September moment

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:30.933
that I'm showing here.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.300
OK, I think I can move
on to the next.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.833
So we're going to be speaking
on this subject together for

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:51.600
the next week or two, and
we'll be failing to

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.067
communicate unless we have
a common terminology.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.400
And so, I just want to be sure
that you understand these

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.433
terms before I go any further.

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:05.167
First of all, I've broken
this into kind of

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:08.433
zones at various latitudes.

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:10.200
And the first one I want to talk
about is what's called

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.333
the equatorial zone.

00:12:12.333 --> 00:12:16.733
Of course, it's the zone going
around the Earth east to west.

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:19.700
Some authors differ on these
definitions, but for the

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:23.067
present purposes I'm going to
say from five degrees north to

00:12:23.067 --> 00:12:27.733
five degrees south around the
globe will be what we call the

00:12:27.733 --> 00:12:28.967
equatorial zone.

00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:34.967
Some of the things that goes
on in that zone is that at

00:12:34.967 --> 00:12:37.800
least part of the year, that's
where the Intertropical

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.833
Convergence Zone is.

00:12:38.833 --> 00:12:43.367
That's where the northeast and
the southeast trade winds

00:12:43.367 --> 00:12:50.033
converge at low levels, and
cause rising air, which goes

00:12:50.033 --> 00:12:52.467
back to the question
was just asked.

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:56.167
And in there somewhere will
be the belt of rainforest,

00:12:56.167 --> 00:13:01.067
because it's that rain that
produces that kind of ecology,

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:05.700
that forest that's adapted to
receiving a whole lot of rain

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:06.800
every year.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.400
This word doldrums, you'll
often find in the--

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.400
sometimes in the scientific
literature, sometimes in the

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.700
broader literature, it refers
to a region over the oceans

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.400
where the winds are
usually very weak.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.467
And that's because you're right
in between these two

00:13:24.467 --> 00:13:26.067
trade wind zones.

00:13:26.067 --> 00:13:29.200
So in the early days, when the
sailors were trying to travel

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.867
across the equator, they would
often become becalmed in this

00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:39.667
zone, and then the name doldrums
came from that

00:13:39.667 --> 00:13:40.900
experience.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.800
Then as we go north and south
a little bit more, north or

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.300
south, we enter what's
called the tropics.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.800
And again, authors may differ
a little bit on their

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.467
definitions.

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:57.100
I've defined it as being five
degrees to 23 degrees.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.567
Now I mean by that five degrees
north, to 23 north,

00:14:00.567 --> 00:14:03.967
and five south to 23 south.

00:14:03.967 --> 00:14:06.467
So I'm referring to both the
northern and southern

00:14:06.467 --> 00:14:07.567
hemisphere tropics.

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:10.567
Now I'm sure you know where that
23 comes from, actually

00:14:10.567 --> 00:14:13.333
should be 23 1/2 degrees.

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:18.200
The tilt of the Earth is 23 1/2
degrees from normal to the

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.233
plane of the ecliptic, and based
on that we define the

00:14:21.233 --> 00:14:25.067
so-called Tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn, that at least

00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:27.367
in the traditional literature,
define what

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:28.700
we mean by the tropics.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.400
It's not so precise when
we're applying it to

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.700
meteorology and climate.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.133
It's more of an astronomical
definition of the tropics than

00:14:37.133 --> 00:14:40.300
it is a climatological
definition, but that's OK,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:41.833
it's close enough for
our purposes.

00:14:41.833 --> 00:14:48.233
So in most cases I'm happy to
define the tropics in that way

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:53.767
as being these two belts from
about five degrees up to the

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:55.867
Tropics of Capricorn
and Cancer.

00:14:55.867 --> 00:15:00.133
In that region is where you
have these steady easterly

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:05.967
trade winds, and the Hadley
cell is operating in both

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:11.500
hemispheres, generally in
that range of latitudes.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:12.967
Any questions so far on this?

00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:21.067
Well, the sub tropics then,
we'll take to be from 23--

00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:23.433
and here authors again differ
quite a bit, I'm going to take

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:28.300
it 23 to 35, so it's
somewhere in here.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:33.000
Florida would be in
the sub tropics.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Generally you've got high
pressure, slightly higher

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.167
average pressure around the
globe in that belt.

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:43.433
So it's called sometimes the
STHP, the Subtropical High

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:46.767
Pressure, it's also the belt of
deserts, it's where the air

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:49.633
in the Hadley cell
is descending.

00:15:49.633 --> 00:15:53.000
And you know what that means,
when air descends, it

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.167
compresses adiabatically, it
warms, and the relative

00:15:57.167 --> 00:15:58.633
humidity decreases.

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:02.433
That air becomes drier and drier
in the sense of relative

00:16:02.433 --> 00:16:04.633
humidity, so you're unlikely
to get clouds and

00:16:04.633 --> 00:16:09.400
precipitation in any area where
the air is descending,

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.267
therefore that's the
belt of deserts.

00:16:11.267 --> 00:16:14.767
Over the oceans, it has
a special name.

00:16:14.767 --> 00:16:17.000
In the open literature,
sometimes it's called the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.467
horse latitudes.

00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:22.267
That too is a reversal point,
because you've got easterly

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:27.767
trade winds equatorward of that,
and westerlies poleward

00:16:27.767 --> 00:16:31.100
of that, so there's a zone,
again, where the average winds

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:33.633
are very weak.

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:37.667
The tradition of this term is
a bit odd, but in the early

00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:42.600
days, the Spanish were carrying
horses to the New

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.700
World, and when they became
becalmed in the middle of the

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:53.867
Atlantic ocean, and their water
and their food ran out,

00:16:53.867 --> 00:16:56.967
of course, the horses would die
or they'd be eaten by the

00:16:56.967 --> 00:16:58.500
sailors, and then the carcasses

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.567
would be thrown overboard.

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:04.400
So a later sailor or ship
sailing through that region,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.300
would find the carcasses of dead
horses floating in the

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.533
ocean, it became known as
the horse latitudes.

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:12.800
But what that really is
referring to is the fact that

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.667
there's generally weak
winds there.

00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:18.767
So if you're depending on the
wind for your propulsion, then

00:17:18.767 --> 00:17:22.733
that's a difficult part
of the ocean to cross.

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:24.000
Questions on that?

00:17:26.167 --> 00:17:27.833
OK, then we get into
mid latitudes.

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:30.867
That's where we live.

00:17:30.867 --> 00:17:35.567
New Haven's latitude is about
41 degrees north, so we're

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:36.567
clearly in that.

00:17:36.567 --> 00:17:39.567
Generally it's a zone of
westerlies, it's the belt of

00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:42.133
frontal storms, remember all
those little comma clouds we

00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:45.067
saw zipping from west to east?

00:17:45.067 --> 00:17:48.633
That really characterizes
this part of the world.

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:52.633
The jet stream is here, and
the so-called polar front,

00:17:52.633 --> 00:17:56.700
which is a boundary between
colder air to the north and

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.467
warmer air to the south in the
northern hemisphere is found

00:18:00.467 --> 00:18:01.667
in the mid-latitude zone.

00:18:01.667 --> 00:18:04.967
So, these are all really
important terms. Are there any

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:06.200
questions on them?

00:18:09.567 --> 00:18:11.633
OK.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:17.233
Now, the general circulation
is pretty complicated.

00:18:17.233 --> 00:18:19.767
And other aspects of atmospheric
motion such as

00:18:19.767 --> 00:18:23.900
storm development are
pretty complicated.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.433
And in a course like this, we
can't go into all the details,

00:18:26.433 --> 00:18:30.067
but I did want to give you a
broad outline of how the

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.733
atmosphere moves.

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:34.767
What drives it, and kind of
what effects what effects

00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:37.267
what, cause and effect
around the loop.

00:18:37.267 --> 00:18:40.100
I constructed this diagram,
which I'm simply calling

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.333
atmospheric dynamics, it's kind
of a box diagram that

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:46.567
tries to point out some
of the causality.

00:18:46.567 --> 00:18:48.533
The reason I think it's
appropriate to bring in at

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:51.333
this point in the course, is
that you've already dabbled

00:18:51.333 --> 00:18:53.167
with a number of
these concepts.

00:18:53.167 --> 00:18:56.000
So I think you can appreciate
the way some of

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.433
these linkages work.

00:18:57.433 --> 00:18:59.267
Let me run through
it very briefly.

00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:01.800
And this applies, by the way,
not only to the general

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:04.967
circulation, but to really
every type of atmospheric

00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:08.600
motion, including sea breezes
and thunderstorms, everything

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.500
kind of works off this in
one way or another.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:18.233
So, differential heating is the
ultimate cause of all the

00:19:18.233 --> 00:19:22.267
atmospheric motion
on our planet.

00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:24.400
And of course, it would cause
temperature differences.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.900
It would heat up some parts of
the Earth more than others,

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:30.633
the air in that region would
become warmer or cooler

00:19:30.633 --> 00:19:33.533
relative to other regions.

00:19:33.533 --> 00:19:36.633
Now, the temperature differences
generally cause

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.800
density differences.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.767
We can understand that
partially through

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:43.067
the perfect gas law.

00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:45.833
Although remember, there are
three variables in the perfect

00:19:45.833 --> 00:19:47.333
gas law, not just two.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:50.600
But generally, temperature
differences give rise to

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.367
density differences,
as we have argued

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:55.600
before in this course.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.233
Density differences give rise
to pressure differences, not

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:01.000
so much through the perfect
gas law, but through the

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.967
hydrostatic law.

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:08.000
In other words, if I have
cold, dense air here,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.367
hydrostatically, it's
going to have higher

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:12.833
pressure beneath it.

00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:17.567
If I have warm, less dense air
over here, hydrostatically,

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:21.400
it's going to have lower
pressure beneath it So it's

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.367
largely through the hydrostatic
law that we

00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:29.133
develop pressure differences
on a horizontal plane, so

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.700
called sea level pressure
differences, or pressure

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.300
differences at other
horizontal levels.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.433
The pressure differences want
to make the air move.

00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:43.467
Like when I pucker up and blow
through my lips, high pressure

00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:46.000
in my cheeks, low pressure in
the room, the air wants to

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.800
move under the influence of
that pressure difference.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.067
Now, the atmosphere doesn't
work exactly like that, as

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:53.000
I'll talk about later today.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.867
But generally, pressure
differences want to get the

00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:57.100
air moving.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:02.000
In this case, however, the law
that controls that to a first

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.433
approximation, is the
geostrophic law, which I'll be

00:21:04.433 --> 00:21:07.800
talking about later today.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.133
And then it loops back on
itself, because the wind will

00:21:12.133 --> 00:21:16.067
have an influence back on the
temperature of the air.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:17.300
It does that in two ways.

00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:25.700
If I've got cold air here, and
the wind is blowing, it's

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.833
going to carry that cold air
to a different location.

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:33.400
Last time we talked about if air
moves, heat moves too, and

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.400
that's what I'm talking
about here.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.967
So, air will advect from one
place to another, carrying its

00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:41.867
temperature field with it, so
that's going to cause a change

00:21:41.867 --> 00:21:44.233
in some region's temperature.

00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:47.367
And the other thing, if air
converges horizontally, and

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:50.200
air rises, then you get
adiabatic cooling.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.000
Or if air descends, you
get adiabatic warming.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.133
So, there's a couple of ways
in which the wind can

00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:57.300
influence the temperature, and
then the loop just continues.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.367
So, in order to understand
atmospheric dynamics, one has

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:03.733
to understand how all
of these things work

00:22:03.733 --> 00:22:07.167
together in a system.

00:22:07.167 --> 00:22:10.333
And if you took a course in
fluid mechanics or in

00:22:10.333 --> 00:22:16.433
atmospheric dynamics, you'd be
learning how to deal with that

00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:20.900
simultaneous and consistent
action of

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.567
all of those variables.

00:22:22.567 --> 00:22:24.833
But you already, with your
knowledge, can understand the

00:22:24.833 --> 00:22:27.767
pieces, and we'll try to
describe how these different

00:22:27.767 --> 00:22:30.067
systems work in terms
of how the pieces

00:22:30.067 --> 00:22:33.267
play a role in that.

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:34.533
Any questions there?

00:22:38.633 --> 00:22:41.400
OK, so we can't go any further
in atmospheric dynamics

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.533
without knowing about
the Coriolis force.

00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:46.067
And here's just a few
bullet points.

00:22:46.067 --> 00:22:51.533
The name comes from a
French mathematician

00:22:51.533 --> 00:22:52.533
who discovered it.

00:22:52.533 --> 00:22:56.300
He was hired by the French Army
to try to figure out why,

00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:01.967
when they were developing longer
range cannons, that the

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:03.700
cannon was hitting
to the right--

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.133
the shells were hitting to the
right of where they aimed it.

00:23:07.133 --> 00:23:09.533
They didn't notice it when the
cannons were firing only a

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:12.067
short distance, but as they
got longer and longer

00:23:12.067 --> 00:23:16.233
trajectories, they noticed a
systematic bend to the right,

00:23:16.233 --> 00:23:20.033
and he figured out it had to
do, of all things, with the

00:23:20.033 --> 00:23:22.067
rotation of the Earth.

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:23.333
Pretty fundamental discovery.

00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:29.800
Now what is the Earth rotate
with respect to?

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.800
There's always a question
of whether there is some

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.300
reference frame, some ultimate
Newtonian reference frame,

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.333
from which one can measure
such things as the

00:23:39.333 --> 00:23:40.000
rotation of the Earth.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.633
Well, it seems like there is.

00:23:41.633 --> 00:23:45.333
If you look at the most distant
stars and use that as

00:23:45.333 --> 00:23:48.300
a reference frame, and measure
the rotation of the Earth

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.033
relative to that, I think we've
convinced ourselves, I

00:23:52.033 --> 00:23:54.600
think it's true, that
that is the absolute

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:55.967
rotation of the Earth.

00:23:55.967 --> 00:24:00.367
We can take those distant
stars as zero rotating

00:24:00.367 --> 00:24:01.633
inertial reference frame.

00:24:01.633 --> 00:24:04.600
So when I say rotation of the
Earth, that's what I'm

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:05.867
referring to.

00:24:08.233 --> 00:24:11.700
As we'll see when we do some
examples today, it's in some

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.433
sense you might consider to
be a rather weak force.

00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:18.067
You've probably never noticed
it as you walked around are

00:24:18.067 --> 00:24:20.467
throwing baseballs or footballs,
you've probably

00:24:20.467 --> 00:24:22.400
never noticed the
Coriolis force.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.633
Nevertheless, it is acting, but
it's only when you get up

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:29.667
to larger scale systems, such
as the atmosphere and the

00:24:29.667 --> 00:24:31.833
ocean that it turns out
to be important.

00:24:31.833 --> 00:24:33.933
And not just important,
but actually,

00:24:33.933 --> 00:24:36.300
in some ways dominant.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:39.700
In some ways it it's the most
important force that acts on

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.067
the atmosphere and the ocean.

00:24:42.067 --> 00:24:45.067
It has the characteristic, the
odd characteristic of always

00:24:45.067 --> 00:24:46.467
being a deflecting force.

00:24:46.467 --> 00:24:49.900
In other words, whatever motion
you already have with

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:54.100
your object, it doesn't try to
speed you up or slow you down,

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.733
it just tries to turn you.

00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:58.400
So it's always just a
deflecting force.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.800
It acts at right angles
to the motion vector.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.133
I'll come back to that.

00:25:03.133 --> 00:25:06.467
And who's ever seen a
Foucault pendulum?

00:25:06.467 --> 00:25:08.467
Show of hands.

00:25:08.467 --> 00:25:09.900
Only a few of you.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:12.767
Well, it's a remarkable way to
see the action of the Coriolis

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:15.367
force, it is evident in
a Foucault pendulum.

00:25:15.367 --> 00:25:16.567
So, I'm going to take
a minute just to

00:25:16.567 --> 00:25:19.067
describe a Foucault pendulum.

00:25:19.067 --> 00:25:23.567
So, imagine that I've take a
string and brought it down

00:25:23.567 --> 00:25:26.533
from the ceiling, and put a
massive weight on it, like

00:25:26.533 --> 00:25:31.067
your coffee urn here, and I
get it swinging back and

00:25:31.067 --> 00:25:36.200
forth, just as a simple
pendulum.

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.500
Turns out that if you can design
a pendulum that will--

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:42.367
of course, that would probably
damp out in half an hour and

00:25:42.367 --> 00:25:43.300
we wouldn't see any motion.

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:47.433
But if it's a massive enough
bob, that weight on the end of

00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:50.100
the pendulum's called a bob,
it might keep going for

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.033
several hours, or even
a day or so.

00:25:52.033 --> 00:25:55.633
And if you did that, you'd begin
to notice that the plane

00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:58.700
of that oscillation would
begin to rotate.

00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:05.600
And this is why, because we're
looking down now at the

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.233
pendulum, so it's swinging back
and forth like this, and

00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:13.767
when it's moving in this
direction, this is a Coriolis

00:26:13.767 --> 00:26:18.700
force, it's acting to deflect it
to the right of the motion.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.900
Well that's going to put it
probably over onto this

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.867
trajectory, but then when it's
swinging back in the other

00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:26.967
direction, again the Coriolis
force acts to the right of the

00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:31.233
motion, the motion has reversed,
and so has the

00:26:31.233 --> 00:26:32.267
Coriolis force.

00:26:32.267 --> 00:26:34.367
So that's going to rotate
the plane of that

00:26:34.367 --> 00:26:36.833
oscillation even more.

00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:40.533
So you can see, slowly through
time the plane of that

00:26:40.533 --> 00:26:43.867
oscillation is going to rotate,
in this case I've

00:26:43.867 --> 00:26:47.467
drawn the Coriolis force acting
to the right of the

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:48.500
motion vector.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.133
And so, the Foucault pendulum's
going to precess in

00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:58.767
the clockwise direction, the
clockwise direction, through

00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:01.733
the action of the
Coriolis force.

00:27:01.733 --> 00:27:03.600
Here's a picture of one.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:06.133
And I'm not sure which one this
is, but they've done the

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:09.433
same trick that I've seen in
the one in the Smithsonian.

00:27:09.433 --> 00:27:15.767
And that is, they put little
markers along here, so that

00:27:15.767 --> 00:27:18.100
you can go look at the pendulum
and go visit some

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.800
other exhibits in the museum,
and then come back a couple

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.933
hours later and see whether
new markers have

00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:24.667
been knocked down.

00:27:24.667 --> 00:27:27.333
And if they have, that will give
you an indication of the

00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:31.833
procession of the plane
of that oscillation.

00:27:31.833 --> 00:27:35.933
And notice here, these have
been knocked down,

00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:36.867
and these have not.

00:27:36.867 --> 00:27:39.867
So we can see that thing is
processing in this direction

00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:41.967
here, and you see these
have been knocked down

00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:42.767
here, and not these.

00:27:42.767 --> 00:27:46.667
So indeed, this one must be in
the Northern hemisphere,

00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:52.800
because it is processing in
the clockwise direction.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.800
Is that clear?

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.900
Questions on this?

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.333
This is a Foucault pendulum.

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:06.200
Wonderful way for seeing this
marvelous, mysterious force

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:10.133
that is so important in the
atmosphere and the ocean.

00:28:10.133 --> 00:28:12.733
Anything?

00:28:12.733 --> 00:28:13.933
Yeah?

00:28:13.933 --> 00:28:15.000
STUDENT: Does that mean that in
the Southern Hemisphere it

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.200
goes counterclockwise?

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.233
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:18.833
It would go opposite in the
Southern Hemisphere, it would

00:28:18.833 --> 00:28:20.933
go in a counterclockwise
direction.

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:21.600
STUDENT: Does that have
anything to do

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.200
with flushing a toilet?

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.767
PROFESSOR: I'll get to that.

00:28:24.767 --> 00:28:27.833
I've got a subject today called
toilet bowl mythology,

00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:30.133
which I'll get to.

00:28:30.133 --> 00:28:33.100
Thanks for the question.

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.167
So, this thing called a Coriolis
force, there's a

00:28:35.167 --> 00:28:38.667
nice, simple formula for
it, and here it is.

00:28:38.667 --> 00:28:41.533
The magnitude of the Coriolis
force is given by the mass of

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:46.400
the object, times 2 times
the speed of the object.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.433
I'm using capital Greek letter
Omega to represent the

00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:56.967
rotation rate of the Earth and
the sine of the latitude.

00:28:56.967 --> 00:29:03.333
Rotation rate of the Earth once
around is 2 pi radians.

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:07.300
It takes one day to do that,
so if I express that in SI

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.000
units, that'll be units of
radians per second, or just

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.667
inverse seconds, and
the value is this.

00:29:14.667 --> 00:29:17.433
Now being in this field, I carry
that number around in my

00:29:17.433 --> 00:29:19.967
head, but there's no
reason for you to.

00:29:19.967 --> 00:29:23.067
Also, it's so easy
to re-derive.

00:29:23.067 --> 00:29:25.367
You just put 2 pi up front, and
then figure out how many

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:30.300
seconds there are in a day, and
divide by that, and you'l

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:34.867
get that famous number, capital
Omega, the rotation

00:29:34.867 --> 00:29:38.333
rate of the Earth, expressed
in radians per second.

00:29:38.333 --> 00:29:38.667
Question?

00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:39.933
STUDENT: What is U? and omega?

00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:42.067
PROFESSOR: Use the speed of the object.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.833
Omega is the rotation
right of the Earth.

00:29:49.467 --> 00:29:50.900
Phi is the latitude
that you're at.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.467
So that tells you about
the magnitude of it.

00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:00.667
The direction, the formula
doesn't tell

00:30:00.667 --> 00:30:02.133
you, but you can remember.

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.567
In the Northern hemisphere, it
acts to the right of the

00:30:04.567 --> 00:30:07.433
motion vector.

00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:10.000
In the Southern hemisphere,
it acts to the left

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.333
of the motion vector.

00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:13.467
Remember, there always has to
be motion, if there's no

00:30:13.467 --> 00:30:17.400
motion, there's no
Coriolis force.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.700
So there always has to be-- the
Coriolis force only acts

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.933
on moving objects.

00:30:21.933 --> 00:30:26.133
If an object is stationary in
the Earth reference frame,

00:30:26.133 --> 00:30:28.900
there's no Coriolis force
acting on it.

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.267
So there's never any ambiguity
about the direction, because

00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:35.700
it already has a motion, and we
use that to figure out what

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.133
direction of the Coriolis
force is.

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:37.533
Julia?

00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:41.467
STUDENT: So even with--so you
were saying when you throw a

00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:41.667
football you dont see the
Coriolis force, is that just

00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:42.900
'cause the distance you throw
it isnt long enough?

00:30:46.933 --> 00:30:47.567
PROFESSOR: Yeah, long

00:30:47.567 --> 00:30:49.533
enough to see it, exactly.

00:30:49.533 --> 00:30:54.567
If you were some Superman that
could fire it 4-5 kilometers,

00:30:54.567 --> 00:30:57.467
it would land a meter or
so to the right of

00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:58.733
where you threw it.

00:30:58.733 --> 00:31:02.567
But, you know, a normal football
quarterback doesn't

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:03.333
throw it that far.

00:31:03.333 --> 00:31:05.933
STUDENT: So does that act
on anything that moves?

00:31:05.933 --> 00:31:07.367
PROFESSOR: Anything that moves.

00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:07.967
STUDENT: Like even a car?

00:31:07.967 --> 00:31:09.033
PROFESSOR: Anything, anything.

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:12.100
As I'm walking across this
floor, there's a Coriolis

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.567
force acting on me
at the moment.

00:31:13.567 --> 00:31:16.567
I can't feel it because it's
too small, but it's there.

00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:19.467
Anything that moves on the
earth feels the Coriolis

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:21.400
force, whether it's a--

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.700
well, just anything at all,
anything that moves.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.500
Absolutely.

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.700
And there's no Coriolis
force at the equator.

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.333
And you'll see that right here,
because if you put in

00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:34.467
zero degrees for latitude
at the equator, the

00:31:34.467 --> 00:31:36.767
sine of zero is zero.

00:31:36.767 --> 00:31:39.300
And so, there's no Coriolis
force at the equator, and of

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.533
course it's strongest
at the poles.

00:31:41.533 --> 00:31:46.900
At the poles, latitude is 90,
the sine of 90 is one, and you

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:50.900
get everything else here
for the strength of

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.167
the Coriolis force.

00:31:53.167 --> 00:31:54.433
Questions there?

00:31:56.933 --> 00:31:59.633
Let me do a little example, I
put one up on the board here.

00:32:03.667 --> 00:32:07.367
I've written that same formula
out, did I get it right?

00:32:07.367 --> 00:32:08.767
Yes.

00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:13.167
Let's say we've got a mass of
one kilogram, at a latitude of

00:32:13.167 --> 00:32:18.867
30 degrees north, moving at 10
meters per second, on Earth,

00:32:18.867 --> 00:32:20.600
so there's the rotation
rate of Earth.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:25.200
I plug it into the formula, one
kilogram times two, times

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.367
the speed, times the
rotation rate.

00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:31.333
The sine of 30 degrees, if you
don't remember, is 0.5.

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:34.400
That comes out to be
7.27 times ten to

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.133
the minus four Newtons.

00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:38.233
That's a force unit
in the SI system.

00:32:38.233 --> 00:32:39.567
And what direction
does it act?

00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:41.233
Well, it depends on what
direction the motion is.

00:32:41.233 --> 00:32:42.400
I haven't told you that.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.933
If the object is moving towards
the northeast, the

00:32:45.933 --> 00:32:49.133
Coriolis force will be towards
the southeast. If the object

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:52.300
happens to be moving towards
the southeast, the Coriolis

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:55.267
force will be towards the
southwest. So always to the

00:32:55.267 --> 00:33:02.900
right of the motion vector,
whatever the motion vector is.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.133
Coriolis force.

00:33:07.533 --> 00:33:10.833
Now, here's where it comes
in to the atmospheric

00:33:10.833 --> 00:33:13.267
application.

00:33:13.267 --> 00:33:18.833
Very often, we find that air
is moving along, around the

00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:21.333
atmosphere, in the atmosphere,
in a state

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:24.933
of geostrophic balance.

00:33:24.933 --> 00:33:26.600
Geostrophic balance
is a particular

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.000
kind of force balance.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.167
Remember hydrostatic balance was
a kind of force balance,

00:33:32.167 --> 00:33:35.533
it's a balance between weight
and the vertical pressure

00:33:35.533 --> 00:33:37.133
gradient force.

00:33:37.133 --> 00:33:40.100
Well, this is more of a force
balance in the horizontal.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:43.067
So it's horizontal forces that
we're talking about.

00:33:43.067 --> 00:33:46.133
Pressure gradient force and the
Coriolis force, when they

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:49.733
come into balance, we call that
geostrophic, geo meaning

00:33:49.733 --> 00:33:52.800
Earth, stroph coming from
a root meaning turning.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.733
So you know it has to do
something with the turning of

00:33:54.733 --> 00:33:57.167
the Earth, well, in this
case it has to do with

00:33:57.167 --> 00:34:00.167
the Coriolis force.

00:34:00.167 --> 00:34:03.567
It results in some very odd
things that I'll show you, as

00:34:03.567 --> 00:34:05.167
we move through this section.

00:34:05.167 --> 00:34:07.767
For example, the wind blows
parallel to the isobars

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:10.333
instead of across them.

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:14.767
And the speed of the wind is
related to the isobar spacing.

00:34:14.767 --> 00:34:17.800
The geostrophic force balance
applies actually most of the

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.467
time in the free atmosphere.

00:34:20.467 --> 00:34:24.267
I hesitate to give you a number,
but I would say maybe

00:34:24.267 --> 00:34:27.867
90 or 95% of the time, when
you're above the boundary

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:33.733
layer, the air is moving along
at a pretty good state of

00:34:33.733 --> 00:34:35.167
geostrophic force balance.

00:34:35.167 --> 00:34:38.233
This is why it's so important
for us to understand this

00:34:38.233 --> 00:34:41.033
particular characteristic
of the atmosphere.

00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:43.633
It is invalid, however, you do
not have geostrophic force

00:34:43.633 --> 00:34:47.000
balance down in the frictional
boundary layer, where there's

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.567
a lot of turbulence, or in
strong storms or other

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:53.400
disturbances.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:58.767
So it's not universally
applicable, but it's widely

00:34:58.767 --> 00:35:01.167
applicable.

00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:04.900
Here's a little cartoon then,
of describing what I mean by

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.967
geostrophic balance.

00:35:05.967 --> 00:35:07.200
So if I have--

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.767
this a plan form view.

00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:13.367
So I'm looking down at the
surface of the Earth, north,

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:19.333
south, east, west. And if
there happens to be high

00:35:19.333 --> 00:35:22.800
pressure to the south on this
particular day, and low

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:26.567
pressure to the north, then
there's going to be a pressure

00:35:26.567 --> 00:35:31.433
gradient force acting on a
parcel of air sitting here

00:35:31.433 --> 00:35:33.467
from high to low.

00:35:33.467 --> 00:35:39.867
If I've got an object, no matter
how small it is, if

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:42.867
there's slightly higher pressure
on one side and lower

00:35:42.867 --> 00:35:45.533
pressure on the other side,
there's going to be a net

00:35:45.533 --> 00:35:46.400
force on that.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.333
That net force is what we call
the pressure gradient force.

00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:53.267
We call it a pressure gradient
force because it arises

00:35:53.267 --> 00:35:55.967
because there is a gradient.

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:58.633
Gradient means a change in
pressure with position.

00:36:01.733 --> 00:36:04.433
So, high pressure here, low
pressure there, means that

00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:06.367
object is going have a slightly
higher pressure on

00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:10.400
the southward side, a little
lower pressure on the northern

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.100
side, and the net force is
going to be to the north,

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.433
called the pressure
gradient force.

00:36:17.433 --> 00:36:23.733
Now, if it's in geostrophic
balance, it has to have a

00:36:23.733 --> 00:36:26.367
Coriolis force that is equal
and opposite to that.

00:36:26.367 --> 00:36:29.233
This is a vector balance,
so the speed--

00:36:29.233 --> 00:36:32.100
the magnitude and the direction
have to be exactly

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.100
opposite to that.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.733
And here's how the
reasoning goes.

00:36:37.733 --> 00:36:41.867
If the force must be like that,
then what must the air

00:36:41.867 --> 00:36:43.900
be doing, how must
it be moving.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.533
It must be moving, then, from
west to east, so that the

00:36:48.533 --> 00:36:52.533
Coriolis force which is at right
angles to it, has the

00:36:52.533 --> 00:36:55.833
orientation given by
the green vector.

00:36:55.833 --> 00:36:57.867
So this is the only
consistent--

00:36:57.867 --> 00:37:00.367
once I draw in that pressure
gradient force, than that

00:37:00.367 --> 00:37:04.233
vector and that vector are
locked in, that's the only way

00:37:04.233 --> 00:37:08.233
I can draw them if that's
air parcel is to be

00:37:08.233 --> 00:37:10.167
in geostrophic balance.

00:37:13.933 --> 00:37:18.600
These lines of constant pressure
are called isobars,

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.433
and you could label them with
a pressure, 1,020, 1,010,

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:28.933
1,000, 990; those are just lines
of constant pressure

00:37:28.933 --> 00:37:31.367
drawn on a map called isobars.

00:37:31.367 --> 00:37:34.500
And so, you'll notice that in
this circumstance, instead of

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:37.300
the air blowing from high
pressure to low, like you

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:42.033
would have expected, because
of the Coriolis force, it

00:37:42.033 --> 00:37:45.600
moves along the isobars,
not across them.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:50.033
Quite a surprise, because in
our common world, you know

00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:53.967
blowing up a tire to a bicycle,
or whatever, air

00:37:53.967 --> 00:37:55.967
tends to move from high
pressure to low.

00:37:55.967 --> 00:37:58.633
But on a larger scale, where
the Coriolis force plays a

00:37:58.633 --> 00:38:01.967
role, it's more like this.

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:07.600
Air moves along the isobars
rather than across them.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.867
Questions here?

00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:15.200
Now, so mathematically, we
want to write down an

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.500
expression for this geostrophic
balance, so let me

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.233
write that down.

00:38:20.233 --> 00:38:24.367
First of all, I need a formula
for the pressure gradient

00:38:24.367 --> 00:38:27.767
force, and that's given by the
pressure gradient times the

00:38:27.767 --> 00:38:30.033
volume of the object.

00:38:30.033 --> 00:38:32.233
The pressure gradient is defined
as the rate at which

00:38:32.233 --> 00:38:35.667
pressure changes with
position, as units

00:38:35.667 --> 00:38:38.900
of pascals per meter.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.533
And the volume is just
the volume of the

00:38:40.533 --> 00:38:44.833
object in cubic meters.

00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:49.500
The mass of any object would be
given by its mass density

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:52.667
times its volume.

00:38:52.667 --> 00:38:55.500
So, going back a couple of
slides where I have the

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.400
formula for the Coriolis force,
and adding these two

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:05.033
formulas to it, I can come up
with this very important,

00:39:05.033 --> 00:39:07.067
slightly lengthy equation.

00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:12.500
But on the left, is the pressure
gradient force given

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:19.000
by this, and on the right, is
the Coriolis force, given here

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:19.767
on the board still.

00:39:19.767 --> 00:39:24.933
But for mass, I've put in the
product of the density and the

00:39:24.933 --> 00:39:28.167
volume of the air parcel that's
being considered.

00:39:28.167 --> 00:39:29.967
So now, we're not considering
any old object--

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:33.200
it's not a, car it's not a
freight train, it's not a

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:37.033
howitzer shell, it's a
little chunk of air.

00:39:37.033 --> 00:39:39.567
We're trying to come up with a
geostrophic balance formula

00:39:39.567 --> 00:39:44.233
for a chunk of air and rho is
the density of that air,

00:39:44.233 --> 00:39:47.100
volume, 2U omega sine theta.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:50.233
Now, the volumes are going to
cancel out from the left and

00:39:50.233 --> 00:39:53.667
right, and I can solve this
formula for u, I'll put a

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:57.233
subsequent geostrophic on it,
it's given by the pressure

00:39:57.233 --> 00:40:06.700
gradient divided by two rho
omega sine of the latitude.

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.833
This is a rather remarkable
formula.

00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:12.467
It doesn't solve every problem
in atmospheric dynamics, but

00:40:12.467 --> 00:40:14.167
it's still rather remarkable.

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:18.467
It says if you know something
about the pressure field, I

00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:21.767
can tell you something
about the wind.

00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:29.833
It's a relationship between
spatial variations in pressure

00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:33.200
and the wind speed and
direction, called the

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.200
geostrophic formula.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.567
Let's see.

00:40:42.567 --> 00:40:45.300
Let me do the problem on
the board first, and

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.133
then we'll go on here.

00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:50.400
Hope you can see this.

00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:58.500
So again, we're looking down on
a map, north, south, east,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:01.267
west. And on this particular
day, the

00:41:01.267 --> 00:41:04.967
isobars look like this.

00:41:04.967 --> 00:41:09.200
This one's labeled 1,012
millibars, 1,011, 1,010,

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.267
1,009, so these are lines of
constant pressure, isobars,

00:41:13.267 --> 00:41:15.833
constant pressure.

00:41:15.833 --> 00:41:18.967
And let's say for the sake of
argument that the spacing

00:41:18.967 --> 00:41:24.667
between those isobars is
about 100 kilometers.

00:41:24.667 --> 00:41:28.833
About 50 miles between these
different things.

00:41:28.833 --> 00:41:33.233
So the pressure gradient is
derived as the rate at which

00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:36.100
pressure changes with distance,
so it's going to be

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:40.767
one millibar divided
by that distance.

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:43.933
So it's delta P over L, one
millibar divided by 100

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:47.833
kilometers, that's 100 Pascals,
divided by 10 to the

00:41:47.833 --> 00:41:51.900
fifth meters, so the answer
is 10 to the minus

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.800
3 Pascals per meter.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.667
That's the pressure gradient,
the magnitude of the pressure

00:41:56.667 --> 00:41:59.000
gradient in that region.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.267
It's a reasonable value.

00:42:02.267 --> 00:42:04.233
Now I'm ready to plug
it into the formula.

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:11.600
Let's see if I've transcribed
it right, pressure gradient

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.000
over two rho omega sine
of the latitude, OK.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.633
The pressure gradient, we
decide, is 10 to minus three.

00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:24.233
I'm going to use sea level
density, 1.2 kilograms per

00:42:24.233 --> 00:42:27.200
cubic meter, here comes the
rotation rate of the Earth,

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.200
capital Omega.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.967
And for this problem I'm going
to say we're in New Haven, the

00:42:30.967 --> 00:42:37.700
latitude's around 42 north,
sine of 42 is about 0.67.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:44.533
Plug all that in I get 0.08
times 10 to the two, and just

00:42:44.533 --> 00:42:46.100
moving the decimal place
over, that's

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.100
eight meters per second.

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.100
So under this circumstance,
the speed would be eight

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.367
meters per second.

00:42:54.367 --> 00:42:56.833
And I know what the direction
is going to be too, because

00:42:56.833 --> 00:43:00.400
it's going to be parallel to
the isobars, with the high

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.000
pressure on the right.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.433
High pressure on the right, so
that's going to be the wind

00:43:06.433 --> 00:43:11.367
vector, eight meters per second,
under that kind of a

00:43:11.367 --> 00:43:12.767
pressure situation.

00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:16.667
Any questions on that?

00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:20.500
An easy calculation to do, once
you know something about

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.600
how the how the isobars look.

00:43:25.467 --> 00:43:26.733
Question there?

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.400
So, if I were to imagine another
isobar pattern that

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.667
was in the form of a circle,
or a bullseye, whenever you

00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:46.967
have an isolated low pressure
region with high pressure all

00:43:46.967 --> 00:43:49.500
the way around, it you normally
refer to that in

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:52.100
meteorology as a cyclone.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.000
Sometimes the word cyclone
has other connotations.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.467
It may imply some kind of severe
storm, or a tornado, or

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:01.733
something like that.

00:44:03.967 --> 00:44:08.000
In the Wizard of Oz, when
Dorothy was sucked up into the

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.633
tornado, she was referring
to that as a cyclone.

00:44:12.633 --> 00:44:12.800
Right?

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:12.967
Cyclone.

00:44:12.967 --> 00:44:17.600
But in meteorology, it has
somewhat broader and less

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.067
dangerous meaning.

00:44:19.067 --> 00:44:21.967
It's just a low pressure
center with a high

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:24.700
pressure around it.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:28.000
And so, I've drawn the
isobars in this way.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.400
And let's imagine a parcel
sitting there, kind of halfway

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.967
out from the center.

00:44:33.967 --> 00:44:36.500
So, there's high pressure here,
and low pressure there,

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.467
so the pressure gradient force
is going to be from high to

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:43.267
low, so the red arrow's going
to be the pressure gradient

00:44:43.267 --> 00:44:46.533
force, PGF.

00:44:46.533 --> 00:44:49.933
If it's to be in geostrophic
balance, the Coriolis force

00:44:49.933 --> 00:44:53.100
must be equal and opposite
to that.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:57.467
And the only way, given the
properties of the Coriolis

00:44:57.467 --> 00:44:59.967
force, the only way it can have
a Coriolis force in that

00:44:59.967 --> 00:45:03.400
direction is if the wind
velocity was to the north.

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.867
Because then, the Coriolis force
is to the right of the

00:45:06.867 --> 00:45:08.667
motion vector.

00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:12.367
So I conclude, by that
reasoning, that the air must

00:45:12.367 --> 00:45:15.267
be moving northwards, or I could
say it's a southerly

00:45:15.267 --> 00:45:16.700
wind at that location.

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:21.133
If I repeated the calculation
there, and there, and there,

00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:23.333
here I would find that the wind
must be blowing in that

00:45:23.333 --> 00:45:26.233
direction, here I would find
it must be blowing in that

00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:28.900
direction, here, in
that direction.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.533
So in fact, the air must be
going around the cyclone in a

00:45:33.533 --> 00:45:36.300
counterclockwise direction,
if we're in the Northern

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.367
hemisphere.

00:45:38.367 --> 00:45:40.267
Is that clear?

00:45:40.267 --> 00:45:44.000
So, low pressure, cyclone,
Northern hemisphere, air goes

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.100
around counterclockwise.

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:49.800
We say that's the cyclonic
direction, the air is moving

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:54.133
cyclonically around that
low pressure zone.

00:45:56.767 --> 00:45:59.533
But now, we want to take a
somewhat broader view of this,

00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:01.967
so I'm going to introduce--

00:46:01.967 --> 00:46:04.667
OK, this is a big jump, but I
think we're ready to do this.

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:07.333
So, here's the equator.

00:46:07.333 --> 00:46:10.000
So Northern hemisphere,
Southern hemisphere.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.100
There's the problem I just
worked out, there's the low

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:15.600
pressure, and that's
called a cyclone.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:18.767
I'm going to introduce an
anticyclone in the Northern

00:46:18.767 --> 00:46:20.733
hemisphere.

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:22.700
And then in the Southern
hemisphere, I'm going to have

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:26.733
a cyclone and an anticyclone.

00:46:26.733 --> 00:46:29.333
And we're going to understand
what way the wind blows around

00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:32.867
each of these systems. Well,
let's stay in the Northern

00:46:32.867 --> 00:46:36.567
hemisphere, with high pressure
in the center, the pressure

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:41.133
gradient forces it outwards, so
the Coriolis force must be

00:46:41.133 --> 00:46:45.667
inwards, so the air must
go around this way.

00:46:45.667 --> 00:46:49.933
It must go around in the
clockwise direction.

00:46:49.933 --> 00:46:55.833
Around an anticyclone in the
Northern hemisphere.

00:46:55.833 --> 00:46:58.600
In the Southern hemisphere,
we've got the low pressure in

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.900
the center again, because it's
a cyclone, but now, the

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.233
pressure gradient force is again
in towards the center.

00:47:04.233 --> 00:47:08.567
But because the Coriolis force
acts to the left of the motion

00:47:08.567 --> 00:47:13.167
vector, we end up with just
the opposite circulation,

00:47:13.167 --> 00:47:14.567
direction to the circulation.

00:47:14.567 --> 00:47:18.333
It's clockwise here, and
counterclockwise around the

00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:19.567
anticyclone.

00:47:26.067 --> 00:47:30.233
So, this is a weather map
taken from yesterday.

00:47:30.233 --> 00:47:32.900
At 500 millibars, so about
five kilometers up in the

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:35.733
atmosphere, you can consider
these black

00:47:35.733 --> 00:47:38.233
lines to be the isobars.

00:47:38.233 --> 00:47:42.933
And they're from individual
balloon launches.

00:47:42.933 --> 00:47:45.067
Every place there's a balloon
launch, they've picked off the

00:47:45.067 --> 00:47:48.267
wind and speed and direction,
and put a wind barb at the

00:47:48.267 --> 00:47:51.433
location of that
balloon launch.

00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:55.633
And notice first of all, that
the wind vectors kind of

00:47:55.633 --> 00:47:57.967
parallel the isobars.

00:48:01.567 --> 00:48:03.800
There's high pressure down here,
low pressure up there,

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:06.267
you might expect the wind to be
blowing from high to low,

00:48:06.267 --> 00:48:10.100
but no, it blows along
the isobars instead.

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:15.300
And that's what we expect from
geostrophic balance.

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.800
Notice also that the wind is
stronger here, it's getting up

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:21.733
to be 70 or 80 knots, where
the isobars are

00:48:21.733 --> 00:48:24.433
packed closely together.

00:48:24.433 --> 00:48:28.833
But where the isobars are far
apart, the wind is very weak.

00:48:28.833 --> 00:48:31.233
We'll take a look at this
formula, this example we did

00:48:31.233 --> 00:48:32.933
for a minute.

00:48:32.933 --> 00:48:36.933
If those isobars were
further apart, then

00:48:36.933 --> 00:48:39.633
the L would be greater.

00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:43.633
If L is greater, the pressure
gradient is less, and putting

00:48:43.633 --> 00:48:46.100
the pressure gradient into the
geostrophic formula, I get a

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.067
weaker wind.

00:48:48.067 --> 00:48:53.467
So directly, whenever you have
closely spaced isobars, you

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:54.900
have strong winds.

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.567
Whenever the isobars are far
apart, you have weak winds.

00:48:58.567 --> 00:49:02.333
That follows directly from
the geostrophic formula.

00:49:02.333 --> 00:49:05.933
For example, here's a map,
and no winds are given.

00:49:05.933 --> 00:49:07.733
This is a sea level
pressure map.

00:49:07.733 --> 00:49:09.800
No winds are given.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:11.700
What can you conclude
from this?

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:14.467
Well, a lot, now that you know
the geostrophic law.

00:49:14.467 --> 00:49:18.267
Because you know that around the
anticyclone, the winds are

00:49:18.267 --> 00:49:20.100
generally going in
this direction.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.033
And because those isobars are
spaced out quite a bit,

00:49:23.033 --> 00:49:26.967
there's a rather weak wind
blowing around here.

00:49:26.967 --> 00:49:29.700
Here near this low pressure,
near this cyclone, with

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:34.133
closely spaced isobars, there
are very strong winds going

00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:37.667
around in a counterclockwise
direction.

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:39.833
We're out of time, but we'll
continue this on Monday.

00:49:39.833 --> 00:49:41.067
Have a good weekend.

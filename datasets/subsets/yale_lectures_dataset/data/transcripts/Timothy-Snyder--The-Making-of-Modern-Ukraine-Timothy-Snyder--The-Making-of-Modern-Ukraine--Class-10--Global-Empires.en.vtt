00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.917
(thoughtful music)

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.850
- Okay, greetings. Happy Thursday.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.850
Welcome. You guys have an
exam a week from today.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.780
We've been talking about the TAs,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.760
about the kinds of things that
are going to be on the exam.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.260
It'll be very straightforward.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.370
Some IDs, some dates, some
short answers, some essays.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.350
You'll have a choice among questions.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.640
You should think about, like...

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.740
Think about what question you would ask.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.343
One way to study is think about
what question you would ask.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.730
Like, what sorts of
things are the big themes?

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.110
And then practice answering it.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.400
Maybe, like, pair up.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.930
Have three people. Divide.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.480
Think about what the big
questions are so far.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.910
I'm not going to ask you
about the first few lectures.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.680
The first few lectures
are to help you think

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.030
about what it is like to
be involved in history.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.180
The subject of the exam are the events

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.650
from roughly the ninth century

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.970
to roughly the seventh century.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.580
So the thing we're doing today

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
is we're taking a deep breath.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.370
We're taking a deep breath. Yeah.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.600
I mean, at this point in this semester,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.750
maybe we should all
physically take a deep breath,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.040
a few deep breaths.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.620
I'm not going to do that
because I'm very conscious

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.600
about how that's going to look.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.080
Professor leads cult at Yale.
(students laughing)

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.543
Makes students perform
breathing exercises.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.410
But what we're doing
is, to change metaphors,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.750
what we're doing is we're
going to zoom back today

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.040
and we're going to think
about empire in general

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.490
and empire in the world.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.200
And the reason why
there's no handout today

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.350
is that this lecture is really much more

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.000
about situating the events
in Ukraine in world history,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.220
because without world history,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.990
it doesn't make a lot of sense,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.970
and let me just give you three reasons

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.270
why I think this is true.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.420
Number one is the point
that we have reached

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.920
in the class chronologically,
where we are now working

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.450
in the period of 1500, 1600,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.450
where we are really in the
Age of Exploration, right?

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.830
We're in the Age of Discovery,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.940
which coincides with the
Renaissance in European history.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.390
We are in the period where
Europeans are looking

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.080
for trade routes, finding
lands that are new to them,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.320
discovering them, from their
point of view, of course,

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.860
making claims on them, setting
up these new trade routes,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.410
destroying states that already exist,

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.840
doing all these very important things

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.590
which for the first time make
of the world a single unit.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.690
So obviously the world
is always a single unit.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.890
There's always weather.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.630
People are always moving.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.830
But somewhere around the age
of 15 or around the year 1500,

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.920
the pace of this picks up, right?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.890
The pace of this picks up so that events

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.200
on one side of the world can affect people

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.430
on the other side of the world,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.740
not on the scale of thousands
of years or hundreds of years,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.900
but on the scale of, let's say, one year.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.110
So in your lifetime,
multiple things that happened

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.820
on the other side of the
world could actually affect

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.680
what happened to you, right?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.180
So there's a change in pace.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.310
There's another change in
pace in the 19th century,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.110
another change in pace in the 21st.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.034
But this is a very important thing,

00:03:27.034 --> 00:03:30.510
a kind of first globalization,
if you'll indulge that.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.330
And I'll give you some examples
of what I'm talking about

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.220
from our own little corner.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.110
When we think about, for example,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.620
the British trying to
find a passage to China,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.260
to the East, through the Arctic Ocean,

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.260
which, let's face it, shows
creativity if nothing else...

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.540
And there isn't one yet.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.790
I mean, you know, in you guys' lifetime,

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.470
there are going to be plenty of passages

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.000
through the Arctic that there aren't now.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.340
But in 1555, there wasn't,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.650
and the British then
stumbled upon Muscovy,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.750
and that opens up a trade route

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.000
where suddenly Muscovy
is trading with Britain,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.300
which means trading with the
world in a westerly direction.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.940
And then by 1647 or so,

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.280
the Muscovites have
reached the Pacific Ocean.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.010
So in that century, suddenly, Muscovy,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.990
which is becoming Russia, of course,

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.630
Muscovy is connected to
both the Atlantic Ocean

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.150
and the Pacific Ocean, and
that's one of the reasons

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.970
why Russia becomes the
state that it becomes,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.050
is that Russia manages

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.450
to have an Atlantic and
a Pacific connection

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.910
as the world is becoming connected, right?

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.640
And that's one of the ways
that Russia is distinct from,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.410
let's say, the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
or the Kazakh state that we'll
be talking about on Tuesday.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.360
By the way, on Tuesday,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.270
I'm going to pick up where
we left off, roughly 1648,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.910
and we are going to talk
about the Crimean Tatars.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.440
We're going to talk
about the Ottoman Empire.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.123
We're going to bring that into
encounter with Russia. Okay.

00:04:53.974 --> 00:04:56.880
So the timeline that
we are on is coinciding

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.340
with a much bigger timeline.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.670
If we think of 1648 as the
moment of the Kazakh rebellion,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.530
1648 is also roughly the moment
when a Muscovite explorer,

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.200
this guy Dezhnev, gets
to the Pacific Ocean

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.570
and actually crosses into North America

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.690
as the first person to
do so in that direction,

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.400
at least in the modern period.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.450
Obviously it'd been done before

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.770
or there wouldn't be
people in North America,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.220
but that's a different story.

00:05:22.312 --> 00:05:27.312
So we are thinking about
how our events connect

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.330
to world history, and we don't
really have a choice, right?

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.280
It's not that I'm trying
to be cool and avant garde

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.870
with this global history
thing, which is, by the way,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.430
it's not cool and avant garde anymore.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.090
It's that these events
don't actually make sense.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.923
So in the next lecture, for example,

00:05:42.144 --> 00:05:45.510
in 1721, Russia is going to be,

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.060
Muscovy is going to be
renamed the Russian Empire

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.770
at almost exactly the same time
that Moscow bans Ukrainians

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.640
from selling grain except
through Muscovite ports, right?

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.300
Those two events are connected,
right? They're connected.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.170
The fact that it is Moscow

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:05.700
that's controlling the
world trade of grain

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.160
from the most fertile part of Europe,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.514
namely Ukraine, is very important.

00:06:10.514 --> 00:06:12.720
The myth of what Russia is,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.490
which we're also contending with,

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.070
has to do not just with
claiming the name Russia.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.530
It also has to do with
controlling the land.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.230
And I'm sure you can see the
connection to the present war.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.610
It's 2022,

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.520
and those two things are
still very much connected.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.560
If it's Russia, then of course

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.560
there's nothing wrong with
Russia controlling the land

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.110
and controlling the export of grain.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.220
Okay, so the first reason is
that we can't really make sense

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.946
of what's happening unless we connect it,

00:06:39.946 --> 00:06:43.260
at least in a very preliminary
way, to world history.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.680
The second reason is
that this is also a time

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.200
of the intellectual reconfiguration

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.510
of how people see themselves in the world,

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.120
which I realize is a
very, very big notion,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.250
and I'm going to have to
give it to you very briefly.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.910
But thus far, when we
think about geography,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.200
we've been thinking about geography

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.710
in terms of what classical authors knew

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.520
and how classical authors
described the world

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.670
and how land explorers in our part

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.510
of the world describe the world.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.390
But basically, the framework
of the people who, you know,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.260
who we're talking about is an
ancient Greco-Roman framework,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.810
and the maps of Ukraine,
such as they were,

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:24.420
were from, you know, Ptolemy or Herodotus.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.051
And if you remember,

00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:28.680
the ancient Greeks had this nice habit

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.230
of projecting things onto Ukraine,

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.860
like, so griffins and
fields of gold and so on,

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.693
which weren't, like...

00:07:35.693 --> 00:07:36.960
They had some basis in reality.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.940
The Scythians actually
did make beautiful things

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.370
out of gold, which are
currently being plundered.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.600
But the notion is that
the Greeks projected,

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.110
you know, a lot of things
that sort of happened

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.090
onto the territories
that they didn't know.

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.550
The Age of Exploration is also a time

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.370
when the Poles are mapping Ukraine.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.203
We're going to get...

00:07:57.203 --> 00:07:58.530
So we've talked about Polish colonization.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.380
You can't separate
colonization from mapping.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.690
The Poles and other
people are mapping Ukraine

00:08:03.690 --> 00:08:05.340
in the 16th and 17th centuries.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.640
And by the way, the word
they use for it is Ukraine.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.963
The Poles say Ukraine.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.446
The whole idea of Ukraine
is not a new idea at all,

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:15.960
as I'm sure you've already understood.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.110
But in this mapping which the Poles do,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:21.630
they are going beyond classical knowledge,

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:23.070
going beyond classical knowledge,

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:27.153
which is a very important thing
locally but also globally,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.020
because classical knowledge
did not include something

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.940
which is very important about the world

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.100
and which Copernicus, you know,

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.170
was the person to actually get clear,

00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.310
which is that our world

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.290
is actually not especially interesting.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:43.230
I mean, okay, it's interesting
from our point of view,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.640
because here we are, right?

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.500
But it's not interesting in the sense

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.850
that it's the center of anything.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.710
The sun doesn't orbit around it.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.970
Everything doesn't orbit around it.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.680
It turns out we're not
the center of the world,

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.370
which is a discovery, frankly,
that's still sinking in,

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.840
you know, many centuries later.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.001
But the age of discovery of
the world is also the age

00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:03.150
of discovery that the world is
not the center of everything.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.300
So there are major
intellectual transformation

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:07.920
happening at the same time, right?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.810
There's a kind of loss of innocence.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.870
The same moment when Europeans
are discovering in the world,

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.390
they're also discovering or
trying to take in the reality

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.430
that the world that they're
discovering is not the center

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.330
of the universe.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.980
So that's a lot to happen, right?

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.540
That's a lot to happen,
and I think it's just,

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.880
it's worth bearing in mind.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.713
The third reason why I'm going

00:09:24.713 --> 00:09:27.720
to give you this very general introduction

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:32.520
to empire as world
history is that a thought

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.840
that we're meant to be having

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.860
over the course of this
class is how Ukraine

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.793
might bridge European
history and global history.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.350
A major theme of European history

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:50.340
and global history is
the theme of colonialism,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.420
and in this story, it's the
Europeans who are colonizing

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.240
and it's the rest of the
world who is being colonized.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.900
But do we want it to be that simple,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.790
or should we look closely about

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.600
and see who is colonizing
who in an empirical way?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.450
It's hard to get away
from the impression that,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.770
both in the early modern and,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.570
as we'll see, the modern periods,

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.560
the idea of being colonized
applies pretty well to Ukraine,

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.370
although it's sitting there
in the middle of Europe.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.490
When the Russian Empire
becomes the Russian Empire,

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.410
when it defines itself as an empire,

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.580
well, what's the center,
and what is the periphery?

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.413
But of course,

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:32.280
there are some interesting
twists to all this too,

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.430
which, again, are relevant
to the present situation.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.400
What does it mean to become an empire

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.010
and to colonize Europe, right?

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.090
What does that mean?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.620
There's a lot of ambiguity in that.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.750
So there's no question
from the point of view

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.370
of the 18th century or, for that matter,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.730
the 21st, that Moscow's perspective

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.850
on Ukraine is in some way colonial.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.610
But what does it mean to colonize a place

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.610
which you also recognize came before you

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.440
in some important sense?

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.050
What does it mean to colonize
a place which you recognize

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:08.490
as being more European than yourself?

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.080
That is not so common, right?

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.550
That is not so common.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.790
And if you grasp that, then
it's a little bit easier

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.880
to get your mind around
the weird ambiguities

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.630
and ambivalences that are
involved even in the discussion

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.210
of Ukraine on Russian television in 2022.

00:11:25.092 --> 00:11:27.660
And then the final thing
is that when we get

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.470
to the modern period, or the
20th century, the 21st century,

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.720
which we will get to, I promise,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.900
a major question of world history is,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.430
and American history, for that matter,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.310
is what do you do after empire, right?

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.600
What do you do after empire?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.850
And one way to look at this conflict

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:46.320
that is happening now between Russia

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.560
and Ukraine is in that framework.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.060
What do you do after empire,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.900
where one answer can be "Let's
have more empire," right?

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:57.150
One answer can be "Let's
concentrate all kinds

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:01.020
of imperial thought and try
them out in the 21st century."

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:02.670
And then there can be another answer,

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.050
which I think is the Ukrainian answer,

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.660
which is "Look for something
that is not anti-imperial

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.370
but which is some way post-imperial."

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.770
And I'll talk more about
that, but it's worth thinking

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:13.230
about that big question of
what happens after empire.

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.350
Okay. So what is empire?

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.460
What's an empire?

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.920
Very briefly, we've talked about this,

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:22.170
I'll give you two very simple
ways to think about empire.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.260
One is that it's the
opposite of a republic.

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:27.750
So if you remember the last lecture,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.910
the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth...

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.740
In Polish, it's the Jrzeczpospolita.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:32.627
It's a (speaking in Polish)
or (speaking in Polish).

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.273
It's a republic,

00:12:35.273 --> 00:12:37.478
which means it's a common matter, right?

00:12:37.478 --> 00:12:39.510
Oh, America's supposed to
be a republic, by the way.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.980
And the thing about republics

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.010
is that republics are
meant to have a group.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:46.110
Now, that group might not
be everybody, and usually,

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.380
it's not, but there is a group
of people who have rights,

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.870
as opposed to, for example, on autocracy.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.570
This notion that a republic
and an empire are in some kind

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.000
of dialectic, of course,
comes from Rome, right?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.980
This is a Roman notion.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.970
You have a republic.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.230
What happens to your republic?

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.470
It falls and it becomes an empire.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.860
So George Lucas didn't invent that, right?

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.840
That whole pattern of politics
where you have a republic

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.910
and it's very flawed, and,
like, the parliamentarism,

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.370
it's really boring, and, like,
there's all this bureaucracy,

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.260
and then someone comes
and he has quick solutions

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.283
and maybe a cloak.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.400
All plagiarized, right?

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.874
Like, this whole notion of a republic,

00:13:22.874 --> 00:13:26.100
the republic that fails
and becomes an empire,

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.350
that's a classic historical trope.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.930
And then even the notion that the people

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.940
who want to restore the
republic are doing so

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.190
because of some kind of
commitment to ideals,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.650
which is the whole theme of
the movies I'm talking about,

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.690
that is also very familiar
from history, right?

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.523
The notion that...

00:13:40.523 --> 00:13:41.356
Well, maybe I can't actually

00:13:41.356 --> 00:13:43.020
justify the republic institutionally,

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.860
but a republic has a moral
advantage over an empire, right?

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.800
That's an argument which
is also 2000 years old

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.090
at the very least.

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.370
Okay, so second definition of empire

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.580
is that you can find a
center and a periphery.

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.557
So in an empire, you
know where the center is,

00:13:58.557 --> 00:14:00.720
and the center is politically superior to

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.860
and economically exploitative
of the periphery.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.980
Okay. So Rome is the paradigm of all this.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.720
I'm now going to spend just a few minutes

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.610
reviewing some of the things that we know

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:14.520
about the first thousand
years of this class,

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.770
but within this framework.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.740
So the Roman Empire...

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.730
We did all this.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:21.630
Does it fall?

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.620
Does it not fall?

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.470
Depends on your point of view, right?

00:14:25.735 --> 00:14:28.590
From the point of view
of what the Franks say

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.680
and then what, you know, the
European Renaissance says,

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.190
it fell and then it was
recreated as the Frankish state

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:39.150
and then intellectually as
the Renaissance later on.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.650
From an East European point of view,

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:41.820
of course, Rome doesn't fall.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.040
Byzantium is the Roman empire,

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.523
and Byzantium lasts until 1453.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.090
And in our class, the way we're thinking

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:52.707
about the emergence of
East European states

00:14:52.707 --> 00:14:56.220
and in particular Kyiv and
Rus is that there's contact

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.860
between these two empires, Byzantium,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.170
which is clearly an
empire, the Frankish state,

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.480
which later calls itself
the Carolingian Empire,

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.420
which just means the Charles-ian Empire,

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.640
they're coming into contact,

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:10.470
they're competing politically

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.320
but also in terms of missionaries,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.790
conversion to Christianity,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.130
and that there's a third interesting force

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.277
that comes in between them,
which are the Vikings, right?

00:15:19.277 --> 00:15:21.660
That is our story of state creation,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:25.530
and it has to do with empire.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:29.730
Now, here is where we get
into a very important point

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.623
which I'm going to emphasize later.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.970
These empires are associated
with a monotheistic religion.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.730
And of course, the thing
which makes Christendom

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:44.580
or the thing which makes
Europe is that it is one,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.360
it's one dominant monotheistic
religion and not others.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.760
The ancient world is a
Mediterranean world, right?

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.070
The ancient Christian world
is a Mediterranean world.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.580
Christendom or Europe is
the world which happens

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.390
not only after Islam but
after Islam in general fails

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.820
to get through the Pyrenees on one side

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.530
and through the Caucasus.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.210
I say in general because of course

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:07.680
there are huge exceptions, right?

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.882
Like the Bulgar Tatar state,

00:16:09.882 --> 00:16:14.010
which then becomes
later the Kazan khanate,

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.620
which today is Tatarstan
and Russia, right?

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.670
But in general,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.910
the idea is that Christendom
is going to be northerly

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:24.300
and Islam is going to be
southerly, in general.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.770
And so these monotheistic states

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:31.200
recognize one another
as monotheistic states,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.000
and they recognize their own peoples

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.330
as people who you do not enslave.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.900
This notion of statehood is so fundamental

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.190
that it often gets overlooked.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:44.670
When we talk about the state,
we often go very quickly

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.430
into very reified things
about what the state might be,

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.330
but one basic notion of a
state is that a state is a zone

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:54.750
in which you do not enslave
your own people, right?

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:57.900
So the larger the state
is, the larger the zone

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:00.810
in which you do not
enslave your own people,

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.430
of course, which raises
interesting questions

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.950
about when the United States
becomes a state, right?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.720
Or when the United States
becomes a republic,

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.390
just to give you a very
familiar territory.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.220
But one way to think about state formation

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.660
is that you have elites

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.390
that are no longer enslaving
the people around them

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:17.880
but instead are comfortable
having them work the land

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.530
and taxing them, right?

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.150
Having some people work
the land and be taxed,

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:22.350
have other people work the land

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:25.110
and become the warrior
class, roughly speaking.

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:28.710
So that's what a state means,

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.250
and that's going to be very
important as we move through,

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.533
because always in the back of your mind,

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:39.064
you should have the theme
of slavery, because slavery,

00:17:39.064 --> 00:17:41.760
it's not some kind of marginal topic.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.920
It's not something you have to
kind of sneak in at the end.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.190
Slavery and statehood work
together very carefully.

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.120
Slavery and recognition work
together very, very carefully.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.090
Like, this theme, which
is a major theme still

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.110
in the history of the United
States in the 21st century,

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:58.320
about who is recognized
as belonging to the state,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.790
has everything to do with slavery

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.680
and the history of slavery.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.580
What I'm trying to suggest

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.770
is that this is actually a very old theme.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.970
It goes back to what the purpose

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:08.820
of a state was from the start.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.623
Okay, so now I want to
remind you of the Mongols,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.080
but in a slightly different way.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.850
So we're going to talk more about this

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.560
on Tuesday, but the...

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.300
If I'm going too fast,
you can just stop me

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.040
and say, "I need to take a breath

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.420
because you promised deep breaths.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:25.253
I need a deep breath."

00:18:25.253 --> 00:18:27.600
You can just say that and I'll...

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.950
Okay, sorry. Cult thing.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.303
Gotta stop. All right.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.570
But no, seriously, if you
have a question, just,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.730
and need me to pause,
just ask and I'll pause.

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.563
Yes?

00:18:36.563 --> 00:18:38.040
- [Student] So, like, these states,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.150
obviously they don't enslave people,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:40.950
but if they're doing things like Russia

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.240
where it's, like, all serfdom-

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.240
- Yeah.
- How is that much different?

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.240
- Right, no, so that's a
very interesting question.

00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:54.870
So if you enslave... Good.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.540
If you enslave, that generally involves,

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.210
not always, but it
generally involves mobility.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.520
So I'm about to talk about one
of the biggest slave markets

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.170
in Europe, which is Kaffa in
the 14th century in Crimea.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:11.280
So slavery involves, not always,
but often involves mobility

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.160
and commerce, so I
enslave you, which means

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:17.940
I can take you somewhere and
sell you, whereas serfdom

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.823
fundamentally is about
binding people to the land.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.140
So if I own serfs or own souls,

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:27.960
I don't actually have the
right to round them up

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.400
and sell them to my neighbor.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.930
What I do have is the right to say

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:32.310
they cannot leave my land.

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.913
But you're right to raise that.

00:19:33.913 --> 00:19:35.370
I mean, that's another question

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:38.550
which redounds over the
centuries in these comparisons

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.410
between Russia and the United States,

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.290
where people who are concerned
with serfdom were reading

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:46.560
the American abolitionist
literature and vice versa,

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.810
and there's a whole interesting
literary story there.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:50.493
So thanks for that question.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.030
So it speaks to what it
means to belong to a state.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.030
So did the serfs belong
to the Muscovite state?

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:00.420
Right? Okay.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.370
So again, that's another...

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.280
A third way to think about
republics and empires is,

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:07.920
if it's a republic, then theoretically,

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.060
you can belong to the state.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.140
Not everybody does.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.510
In an empire, mmm, there's not really,

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.860
that promise is not really contained

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.240
in the notion of the state.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.340
All right, so let's
think about the Mongols,

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:19.560
but now in a slightly different way.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.970
The Mongols, as you know,
come in and lay waste

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.480
to what remains of Kyiv and
Rus in the 13th century,

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.490
and then they stick around,

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.500
and they stick around in their state,

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.970
which is called the Golden Horde,

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.620
breaks up into various other states,

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:35.850
including the Crimean Khanate,

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.030
which we're going to talk more
about in the next lecture.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:42.990
But the moment that I want to
pause on here is in the 1340s

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.443
where something very important happens,

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.470
and it has to do with slavery.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.780
So the most important

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.240
or one of the most important centers

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.690
of the slave trade was a city which used

00:20:57.690 --> 00:20:59.610
to be known as Theodosius
but which at the time

00:20:59.610 --> 00:21:04.080
in the 14th century is known
as Kaffa, K-A-F-F-A, Kaffa,

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.370
on the eastern edge of
the Crimean Peninsula.

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:11.760
And at this time in the 14th century,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:13.810
it is the Genoese

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.580
who are trading in Crimea.

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.320
So when we do the history of Crimea,

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.730
this is all going to become clear,

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.011
but when people talk about,
like, what Crimea always was,

00:21:24.011 --> 00:21:26.130
that's extremely suspicious,

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.260
because Crimea has been a whole,

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.640
even compared to the rest of Ukraine,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.020
it's been a whole lot of things

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.450
in a very interesting sequence.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.170
But in the 14th century, it
is the Italian city states,

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:41.130
and in particular Genoa, that
are dominating the trade,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.270
and, you know, either by
purchasing or by force,

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.120
are trying to control
some of the territory

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:51.630
which belongs to the local khanate.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.520
So there is a battle in the 1340s

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.373
between Genoa and
between the Golden Horde,

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.860
and according to history,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.200
although it's a little
bit too good to be true,

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.033
it's one of these things

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.270
that's a little bit good to be true,

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:08.400
the way the Black Death spreads...

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.540
Have you heard this story?

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.770
The way the Black Death spreads

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.960
is that the people on the side

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.410
of the Golden Horde are
dying of the Black Death.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.660
This is 1346, 1347.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.670
And so in order to...

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.560
So they invent biological weaponry.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.110
Again, as I say, slightly too
good to be true, this story.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.070
And they catapult the corpses
of their own dead soldiers

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.340
and commanders over the
walls against the Genoese.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.900
And this spreads the Black Death,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:35.310
and then the Genoese spread
it throughout Europe.

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.200
Okay, that happened, but the reason

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.400
why it's a little too good to be true

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.840
is that, of course,
there were other routes

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.520
by which the Black Death
could enter Europe.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.353
I'm sure there was...

00:22:42.353 --> 00:22:44.289
There wasn't only one vector.

00:22:44.289 --> 00:22:46.140
You've now all lived how this works.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.100
Like, there isn't...

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.350
There doesn't have to be
just one plane from China.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.910
There are probably
going to be more vectors

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:52.740
of how the disease spreads.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:54.213
Ah, nods of recognition.

00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.080
But I want to spread
this because I want to...

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.045
I don't want to spread it.
(students laughing)

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:05.045
I want to convey this because
it helps us to see a moment

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.670
where we have the Golden Horde,

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:10.890
we have the Europeans in the 14th century,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.920
and we have a very important change,

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.460
which is that roughly a third
of Western Europe is going

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.380
to die of this disease.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.420
So roughly a third of the population

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:23.760
is going to be wiped out.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.490
And this is very important
for our Age of Exploration,

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.680
which is what we're trying to set up now.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.480
After so much of the European
population is wiped out

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.310
and avenues are cleared for innovation...

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:39.510
This is an optimistic story

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:41.160
of what happens after
a plague, by the way.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.280
So after avenues are
cleared for innovation

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:47.940
and social advancement and
after traditional barriers

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.640
for changing ways of life are broken

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.740
because of all of the death and disease,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.080
then you have this
incredible European century

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.350
of revival after the Black Death.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.230
Meanwhile, dun-dun-dun!

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:05.250
Something very important
happens in Byzantium in 1453,

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.470
which is that...
- The Ottomans take it over.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:09.090
- Yeah, it falls.

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:11.760
Finally, right? Finally.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.410
Okay, from the West
European point of view,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:15.447
it's a thousand years late, but...

00:24:15.447 --> 00:24:18.690
And a thousand years, let's
face it, as a long time.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.920
A thousand years late, but
it finally falls in 1453.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.000
And it falls to the Ottoman
Empire, which is an entity

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.400
which we're going to
cover in the next lecture.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.190
The Ottoman Empire is very
important for Ukraine.

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:34.020
In all these relationships,

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:38.940
which in our reading tend to
look like Poland and Russia,

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:41.580
you know, west and east, the hard part

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:44.280
to force into the story
is the southern part,

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.410
which is the Ottoman Empire
and the Crimean Khanate,

00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:49.800
and I'm going to try to force
that in in the next lecture,

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.660
because none of it makes sense
without the Ottoman Empire.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.320
But the Ottoman Empire
takes over Byzantium,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.673
replaces Byzantium.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.590
Istanbul becomes Constantinople,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.210
and I was reminded by one of, like,

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:05.490
the many people who now
email me about this class

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.670
that They Might Be Giants
did not write that song.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:10.530
Okay, I know they didn't write the song.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.180
I was looking for, like, some reference

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.420
which maybe you guys would possibly get.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.320
Probably failed.

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.680
But anyway, Istanbul
rather than Constantinople,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:23.070
and what this means for Europe...

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.090
And this is where we get

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.770
to our world historical turning point.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.210
What this means for Europe

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.690
is that the Ottoman Empire now controls

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.330
the standard trade routes to Asia.

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:34.860
And because the Ottoman Empire

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.400
controls the standard land routes to Asia,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.890
if you're in a reviving Europe

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.460
and you need those trade
routes, what do you do?

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.810
You do crazy things.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:46.957
Like, if you're England, you say,

00:25:46.957 --> 00:25:49.080
"Hmm, maybe I could
find a passage to China

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.640
through the Arctic Ocean," right?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.590
And then you find Russia instead.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:54.120
Oh, and by the way, I mean,

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.170
this is another example of globalization.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.230
When the Russians sweep through Asia,

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:02.490
basically in a hundred years,

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.920
I mean, it's incredibly fast,

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.170
they're doing that in part
because they have access

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:11.040
to European technology,
namely the musket, right?

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:15.810
The musket. Very simple gunpowder weapons.

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:18.930
They have access to that
because they also have contact

00:26:18.930 --> 00:26:20.130
with the Atlantic World.

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.390
The Atlantic World comes in

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:23.460
and then they make their
way all to the Pacific

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.070
with a very simple
technological advantage.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:29.310
I mean, summarizing it,
they go with muskets

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:32.640
and they collect tribute
in furs, mostly sable.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.730
That's simplifying it, but
that's a big part of the truth.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:37.560
And then they sell those sables

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.960
to China and around the world.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.070
And so it's the...

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.500
And that is, in a microcosm, a big part

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.000
of the history of the Age of Discovery.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.100
You have a technological edge

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.630
and you use that technological edge

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.450
to control a lot of
territory really quickly

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.000
while that technological edge lasts.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.790
That technological edge will
eventually wear itself out,

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.750
and when it wears itself out,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.220
then the tables are going
to be turned on you,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.140
and all of your stories about
how you're superior are going

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.180
to turn out not to be so true, right?

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:05.700
It was the technological
edge, really. Okay.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.320
So you do crazy things.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.910
Like, you might, like, okay,

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:10.893
so you go over the Arctic Ocean.

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.130
Why not? That didn't work out.

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:15.750
But two other things did work out

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:16.710
which you've probably heard of,

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:21.210
like Vasco da Gama going
around the Horn of Africa

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.580
and finding his way and
defeating Arab sailors

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:27.480
and landing in South
Asia, in India, right,

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.153
for the Portuguese, and
Christopher Columbus,

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:33.270
with the even, if possible, wackier idea

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:38.270
of going across the Atlantic
Ocean to make his way to China,

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:41.250
or the Indies, rather,
and discovering, you know,

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.020
something else which he called the Indies.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.513
And so it's now still
called the Indies, weirdly,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.600
or it's now called America.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.240
So all of these things, right?

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.820
The British, the Portuguese, the...

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.770
Columbus wasn't Spanish, but
it was a Spanish mission.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.080
All of this is because of Ottoman Empire

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.610
blocking trade routes,

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.840
and the trade routes then
in turn generate new things.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.580
So after these unexpected encounters

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.113
with new places in America,

00:28:09.155 --> 00:28:11.850
there are new supplies of precious metals,

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.140
and of course there are new people

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:16.350
to colonize and to convert.

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:19.590
Now, I realize this isn't
really our main story,

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.780
but the reason why we have
to have this in the back

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.720
of our mind is because
we are in, as I've said,

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.700
we're entering into this world of empires,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.210
and you can't understand
Ukraine inside empires

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.100
unless we understand what empires are

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.430
at this particular moment in history.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.740
Okay, so some of this history
is going to be familiar

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.150
to you from other classes.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.070
The leading imperial powers

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.350
at the very beginning
are Portugal and Spain.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:47.766
They divide the whole world
between them ambitiously.

00:28:47.766 --> 00:28:50.310
Spain destroys some other
really important states,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:51.990
the Aztecs, the Incas,

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:54.573
kill maybe 10 million
people in the New World.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.110
The Dutch rise and replace

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:02.520
to a large degree the Portuguese in Asia.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.460
They take over the Cape
of Good Hope in 1652.

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.760
The Portuguese are pushed
back to Brazil. Okay.

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.030
And then this brings me
to a theme which I'm sure

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.410
you've kept in mind the
entire time, which is slavery.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.470
So the nature of slavery...

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:20.700
Again, you know,

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.070
it's not like I'm going to
ask you this on the exam.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:27.420
It's just that our history
fits into this larger history

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.120
and it helps the larger
history make sense.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.130
So if you remember,

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.950
our history is partly about how slavery

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:37.770
in a certain part of the
world comes to an end.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.870
The conversions to Christianity

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.230
are about slavery coming to an end.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.610
When you convert to Christianity,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.380
that is one of the first
things that happens.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.610
Other Christians...

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:50.490
I mean, rules are
broken, but in principle,

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.230
other Christians are
not going to enslave you

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.390
and your neighboring Christian
powers are not going to think

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.273
they can raid your country
and enslave the population.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.240
It's not the most glamorous
thing about Christianity,

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.310
and this is not the thing
that rises to the top

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:04.080
in the narrative of conversion, right?

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.570
But it's perhaps the fundamental thing.

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.950
If you create a Christian state,

00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.440
other Christian states are not
going to enslave your people.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.240
You've decided not to enslave your people.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.550
You're going to tax them instead.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:17.490
Very important, very important transition.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:22.490
So our class in a way starts
with this riddle of slavery,

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.640
because you have to, like...

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.590
You can't get away from slavery.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.880
If you're going to study human history,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.770
you can't get away from slavery,

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:32.100
because at any moment where you try

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.170
to start history almost
anywhere in the world,

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.790
you then have to ask the question

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.160
of when you get from this
form of economic organization

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.710
to another form of economic
organization and why

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.100
and under what ideological
and political premises

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.930
and auspices, which is
a way of understanding

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.243
the first few lectures of this class.

00:30:49.417 --> 00:30:53.010
This doesn't mean that slavery
comes to an end, of course.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.470
What it means is that the slave markets,

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.660
like the Genoese one that
I mentioned in Kaffa,

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.020
the slave markets are
trading different people,

00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:05.190
from the Caucasus, for example, from Asia,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:07.713
and then, of course, from Africa.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.220
The Ottomans are increasingly going

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.760
to be getting their slaves from Africa,

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.620
not that they won't enslave
Europeans occasionally,

00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.970
but increasingly, they're going

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.610
to be getting their slaves from Africa.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:22.320
And so this all connects, right?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.770
Because the demand for slaves,
it's going to be present,

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:29.070
but where the slaves are
coming from is going to change.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.560
And so again, I realize I've, like,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.300
pounded this point into the ground,

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:38.070
but the language can help
you remember something

00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:40.560
which subsequent events will then bury.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.260
So our word for slave, right,
the English word for slave,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.660
which comes from the
German Sklave, Sklave,

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.610
which comes from the Arabic
(speaking in Arabic),

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.910
and (speaking in Arabic)
comes from Slav, right?

00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:53.340
Following the language can remind us

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:54.930
of an origin of something,

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.730
or an early phase of
something, let's call it,

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.280
that we might otherwise forget.

00:32:01.925 --> 00:32:04.380
So this is connected to our class

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.330
because of the formation of states

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:10.950
and because of the spread
of Russian power southward,

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:12.480
which is going to be in the next lecture.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.110
But as the Russian state moves southward,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.480
enforcing serfdom, to be sure,

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:20.280
it becomes harder and harder to raid

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.780
for slaves in that direction.

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.253
So the slave markets or
the source of slaves,

00:32:24.253 --> 00:32:27.270
in general, it's going to move southward.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:32.222
And this coincides, this shift
coincides with the emergence

00:32:32.222 --> 00:32:35.490
of the demand for slaves
in the New World, right?

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:39.210
And so then the slave markets are going

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.050
to shift to the New World.

00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.780
The demand for slaves is
coming from the New World

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:45.060
as the slave trade in general has moved

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.460
southward towards Africa.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.170
So again, this is not a connection

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.370
that we need to push too far.

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.710
It's just that I want you
to see that there is a kind

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:55.470
of logical chain of events,

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:58.990
and this larger question
of who belongs to the state

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.220
and who can be enslaved is a question

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.020
which you can follow if you want.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:04.950
You don't have to.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:06.060
I'm not going to make you do this.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.070
But it's a question that you can follow

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.560
from the 10th century in Eastern Europe

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.740
to the 18th century in the United States

00:33:13.740 --> 00:33:15.000
if you want to, right?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.650
It's not just a logical question.

00:33:18.474 --> 00:33:19.620
It's not just a kind of similarity.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:24.480
It's also a chain of events
over time that one can follow.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.240
Okay, so the African slave trade...

00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.100
Yeah, so of course, like, the expansion

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:34.890
of the slave trade to Africa
involves massive death

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.480
and trauma, including by suicide,

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.650
the destruction of local states
and local cultural groups,

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.138
the destruction of the position of women.

00:33:43.138 --> 00:33:45.000
It slows down.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.680
The trade slows down in
the late 18th century,

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.930
early 19th century, as first the French

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.650
and then the British end
the African slave trade.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.360
The slave trade in the
Ottoman Empire comes

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.860
to an end in 1882.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.033
The Civil War in the
United States is in 1863.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:04.470
Okay, so what I...

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.240
The last thing that I want to do

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.930
is to try to bring the history of empire

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.210
through the period where we are now

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.790
a little bit into the
18th and 19th centuries

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.557
so that you can then, as we do the 17th,

00:34:17.557 --> 00:34:20.370
18th, and 19th centuries in Ukraine,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:24.660
you'll have a kind of world
perspective of what's going on.

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.670
I'm going to again pause and
ask if I'm going too quickly

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.983
and see if there are any questions.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.810
Just taking the feel of the room here.

00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:36.120
Okay, you're all at the edge
of your seats. That's good.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:36.990
The camera can't see

00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.250
whether you're on the
edge of your seats or not,

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.960
so I can just, like, say stuff like that.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.190
Okay, so after Spain...

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.867
So the first wave, Spain and Portugal,

00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:47.480
are the most important,

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.442
and then the Netherlands
is the most important,

00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:52.560
and then it's going to be
the British and the French

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.810
who are the most
important colonial powers.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.940
In the 18th century, it's
going to be the British

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.600
and the French who are
competing for world domination.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.510
A side effect of the
British-French competition

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.483
for world domination
is this country, right?

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.630
If you remember the sort of general thesis

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.640
that states can come into existence

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.340
because of a sort of friction
between two greater powers,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.840
in the case of the
United States of America,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:18.660
that would be the friction
between the British

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.760
and the French empires.

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.410
It's particularly a side effect

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.860
of what the world calls
the Seven Years' War

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:29.460
but which American history
calls the French and Indian War,

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.513
slightly obscurely.

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:34.680
So that war, 1756 to 1763,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.020
which is also a European
war, and we'll get to it,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.960
is when the French and
the British redivide

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.550
and where it's going to be clear

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.633
that the British control Canada,
the British control India.

00:35:49.845 --> 00:35:54.450
It was the threat of the French
that kept these colonies,

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:56.130
the American colonies, close to Britain.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.260
When the French threat was removed,

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:00.180
then, structurally, the
colonies could start

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.660
to relax their attitude
towards the British.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.850
It made rebellion possible.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.900
And then, of course, the French came in

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:09.450
at the end of the Revolutionary War.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:10.890
Now, why is that interesting?

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.070
I mean, because, you
know, American history,

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.230
I don't know about you guys, but okay,

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:18.720
well, okay, maybe it's really interesting.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.310
Okay, I find it more
interesting all the time.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.143
I admit it.

00:36:21.143 --> 00:36:22.980
I find American history more
interesting all the time.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:27.330
But one of the things which
is interesting about 1776

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.930
is that it's Europeans liberating
themselves from Europeans,

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.060
Europeans who are defined as colonists

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.720
liberating themselves from
a European empire, right?

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.480
And as they liberate themselves,

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.830
they of course preserve
longer than the imperial power

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:48.120
one of the features of the
empire, which was slavery, right?

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.770
But so it's an interesting
moment where Europeans are,

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.990
people of European
origin define themselves

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.040
as an independent state
and they actually win.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:02.640
Now, I just want you to mark the 1776 date

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.533
because the 1776 date,

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:08.070
that's when the
Revolutionary War took place

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:09.660
in the United States.

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:12.630
Then you're in the same
world historical moment

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.340
not just as the French Revolution,

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.110
okay, I admit that's important too,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:18.060
but you're also in the
same historical moment

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.100
as the end of the Kazakh state,

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.350
which we're going to get
to in the next lecture,

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.030
and you're in the same historical moment

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.460
as the end of the
Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.380
So back in Europe, you're in
a moment where this question

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.160
of European empires controlling
Europeans is also relevant

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.410
but in a slightly different direction.

00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.720
So one way to think about
the end of the 18th century

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.060
is that it's an interesting
moment of exchange

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.770
involving European empires

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:48.180
and European empires
controlling Europeans.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.940
It's also an interesting moment about...

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.010
So roughly at the same time is the moment

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.190
when the Ottoman Empire starts
to withdraw from Europe.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.840
The first couple of decades
of the 19th century,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.750
the Ottoman Empire is going
to be withdrawing from Europe,

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.020
and that power is going to
cease to be an imperial power

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.550
over part of the Balkans,
Greece, and Serbia.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:11.280
Okay, the next thing...

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.390
And I realize this is a lot.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.820
I hope this, like, feels
more like entertainment

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.950
than, you know, than oppression,

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.560
or at least ideally
entertaining oppression.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.843
But the next thought
that I want you to have,

00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:26.490
it has to do with how
empire continues to work

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:30.330
in the world in the age of nationalism.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:33.810
So it's very easy to say

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.780
the nation is against the empire, right?

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.390
And that's a very convenient
sort of position to be in

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.710
because in that case, empire
bad, nation good, right?

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:45.243
Empire big, nation small.

00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:48.240
Empire old, nation new. Right?

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.410
The nation can start fresh,

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:52.260
has no historical baggage, all of that.

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.893
But the truth is that in the 19th century,

00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.880
empire and nation are very much
entangled with one another.

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:04.860
So when Jefferson describes
the United States, for example,

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.870
as an empire of liberty,
that doesn't, I mean,

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.390
that doesn't really make
any sense conceptually,

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.040
but you can see why he's saying it.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.590
It is because the United
States is an empire,

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.230
and you know, the liberty
part is restrained

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:18.300
to a certain group, of course.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.240
On the European continent,
maybe the best example

00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.513
of this entanglement
are the Napoleonic Wars.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.300
On the European continent, the
idea that you can start fresh

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:33.750
is most closely associated
with the French Revolution.

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:36.270
The idea that we're now in a new period

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:38.280
where we understand humanity

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:39.660
and we have a science of humanity

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.090
and we can start fresh, we're enlightened,

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:45.600
is most strongly associated
with the French Revolution.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.440
And when the French Revolution
leads to Napoleon Bonaparte,

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.530
the notion of his wars across Europe

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.560
is that these are wars
of national liberation.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.990
And that's not entirely false.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:59.310
All over Europe, he, you know,

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.110
dispatches his various brothers-in-law

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:02.730
and they start new countries

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:04.478
with new names and new currencies,

00:40:04.478 --> 00:40:09.478
and Napoleon is seen by many
people as a national liberator.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:11.220
But at the same time,

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.440
what Napoleon is building
is also an empire

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:18.440
where the metropole is
clearly going to be Paris.

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:22.110
So you have this ambiguity
about what is national

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:25.680
and what is imperial and
how the two work together.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.530
And you also have this very powerful idea

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:32.940
which is characteristic of
the 19th century and forward

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:37.940
that I can build an empire

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:43.230
by talking about your national liberation.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.710
The French pioneer that,
not just Napoleon Bonaparte,

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.807
but actually Napoleon
II in the 1860s, 1870s.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.930
1859 is really when it starts.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:59.043
I can create an empire by
liberating you nationally.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.590
I mean, I don't even have to tell you

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.073
how much continuity that
idea has had, right?

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.406
Right down to the war in
Ukraine, because after all,

00:41:09.406 --> 00:41:11.520
what is one of the core Russian arguments

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.990
for why they're invading Ukraine?

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:16.020
That in fact, Ukrainians
need to be liberated

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.660
nationally from other empires,

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.480
that what's really happening
in Ukraine is that...

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.933
Okay, it's not the Habsburgs anymore,

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.430
but it's still the Poles
and it's also the Americans

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:30.690
and the European Union and so on.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:32.820
Someone else has made an empire,

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.220
and I'm going to liberate you nationally.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.840
You may not be aware that
this is what is happening,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:37.980
but this is what is happening.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:40.080
And so it's not really an empire.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:41.880
I'm actually liberating you nationally.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.650
And so that argument,

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.570
which comes out of the
middle of the 19th century

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:49.380
and particularly out of
France, is very powerful.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.880
And another connection
between the national

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.460
and the imperial is the economic one.

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.640
So Marx and Engels, who
you may have heard of,

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.973
had this idea that the workers
of the world would unite.

00:42:01.525 --> 00:42:02.370
You've heard of that, right?

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:04.530
1848, "Communist Manifesto."

00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:06.270
One of the problems with this,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.580
as Marx and Engels had to wrestle with,

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:10.980
is that the workers of one country

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:13.320
could be very much in favor of imperialism

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.520
because from their point of view,

00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.670
imperial control over other
territories kept prices down,

00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.200
created other economic opportunities,

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.150
opportunities for
immigration and so on, right?

00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:23.130
So you could be a worker,

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:24.420
but you wouldn't necessarily sympathize

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.800
with a worker in another country

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.140
because your country is
exploiting another country

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:30.960
and that has improved
your standard of living.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.520
And so in that way,

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.070
nationalism and imperialism
could work together

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.830
because the working classes
could become more national

00:42:37.830 --> 00:42:40.950
because their countries were empires,

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:43.170
which is something which
got tangled up in Britain

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:47.403
and is still before our
eyes being disentangled.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.640
Empire could be seen...

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.670
In other words, as mass
politics comes into existence

00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:55.410
and as workers and others get to vote

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.759
and as workers and others
can take part in politics,

00:42:57.759 --> 00:43:01.950
empire could be seen as a
solution to social problems.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:06.810
And so in this way, nation and
empire also get tangled up.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:11.810
Okay, let me just bring this
through the 19th century

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:16.530
and say a word about land
empires and sea empires,

00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:18.573
and then I promise you we will be done.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.500
By the time we get to
the late 19th century,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.330
who is a land empire
and who is a sea empire

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.253
has more or less been sorted out.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.690
Russia is a European
and Asian land empire.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.250
It controls Poland and Finland

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:39.510
as well as all these territories
down through the Pacific.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.773
Actually, it controls California
into the 19th century.

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:47.910
The Americans after 1823
and the Monroe Doctrine

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:52.143
see themselves as controlling
the Western Hemisphere.

00:43:53.428 --> 00:43:55.950
The Russians are stopped

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.520
from becoming a world maritime
empire by the Japanese,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.830
who are a non-European country

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:03.180
which defeats a European country

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:07.620
in war in 1904 and in in 1905.

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:10.440
That's one of the kinds of lines

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.110
when empires run out of territory,

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.410
is when the Russians lose to the Japanese.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.180
The very last thing which happens

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:22.980
in the European imperial
history is the race for Africa.

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.280
So Japan is a line which isn't
crossed by the Europeans.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:27.510
The Japanese defend themselves

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:32.160
and promptly build their own
version of empire in East Asia.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.070
The very last step in European empire

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.853
is the race for Africa,
which is the late 1800s,

00:44:38.692 --> 00:44:40.530
the late 19th century.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:44.220
And the way the race for
Africa works is that...

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.420
It's interesting.

00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.390
After slavery is no longer profitable

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.999
because the slave trade has been banned,

00:44:51.999 --> 00:44:56.999
the countries which are
on the West African coast

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:00.510
push further into Africa
in pursuit of other things

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:03.780
to trade and make different
kinds of arrangements,

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.580
very often also involving domination,

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.160
with the states that they find there.

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:10.470
And so the end of the slave trade,

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.210
in this kind of historical irony,

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.740
leads to a different form of exploitation

00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:15.450
which now involves territory,

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.310
because if you're trading
agricultural goods

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:20.130
or mineral goods, then you
want to control territory.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.390
If you're trading slaves,

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:23.130
you just have to have
connections on the coast.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.470
But so what happens is
the slave trade morphs

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.540
into trade in minerals
and agricultural goods,

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.580
which requires control of territory,

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.860
and so then we have this race for Africa

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.871
which takes place 1870s, 1890s, 1900s.

00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:39.750
And it's at that moment when
Germany joins the French

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.217
and the English and also the Portuguese

00:45:41.217 --> 00:45:43.353
and the Spanish and so on, the Dutch,

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.900
as an imperial power beyond
the boundaries of Europe.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.830
Why does that matter?

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:52.080
And this is really the closing thought.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.520
Of course it matters in and of itself.

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.940
I mean, the history of Africa
is absolutely fascinating.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.790
But it also matters because of the way

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.530
that Africa affects the
European imagination

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.060
of what empire is going to be.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.100
And now, you know, now we're getting

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:09.420
towards the end of the class.

00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.500
The purpose of this lecture has been

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.510
to kind of just prepare
the way for thinking

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:14.730
about empire in the context of Ukraine.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:18.390
But because the race for Africa happens

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.950
in the late 19th century,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.860
it influences the way that Europeans think

00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:24.840
about how they're going to colonize Europe

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.300
when Europeans start to
colonize Europe again

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.103
in the 20th century.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.640
In the First World War,

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:36.360
when the Germans and the
Austrians control Ukraine,

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.220
they will have no hesitation whatever

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.680
in seeing Ukraine as a breadbasket,

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:42.637
which is the phrase which
is used, Kornkammer.

00:46:42.637 --> 00:46:43.950
"Ukraine is a breadbasket.

00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:45.810
Ukraine is going to feed us.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.610
The peasants will have
no trouble with this.

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:48.870
They're going to love it,"

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:50.460
which turns out not to
be true, incidentally.

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.990
The peasants don't love it.

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.580
So the German and Austrian plan

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.780
for winning the First World War

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.150
was "We're going to take the grain,

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.190
we're going to take the
grain from the Ukrainians,

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.170
and then we're going to
feed our own civilians,

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:03.060
they'll be happy, and we're
going to feed our soldiers

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.590
and they'll win on the Western Front."

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:05.760
That's the plan.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.600
It doesn't work out

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.150
because the Ukrainian peasants
don't play their role.

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:11.790
But to make a long story
short, and don't worry,

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.660
I'll tell the longer version,
Hitler thinks this too.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.180
Hitler thinks that
Ukraine is a Kornkammer.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.620
It's a breadbasket.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.210
It's an unlimited supply of food.

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.550
He thinks that the Ukrainian peasants are,

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:27.510
in his imagination, the
way that the Africans are,

00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:29.520
and his analogies towards Ukraine,

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.340
although he has many, he
uses India, he uses America,

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:34.260
he applies India and America as well,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.630
but the main way he thinks about Ukraine

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:40.560
is from a colonial imaginary
that comes from Africa.

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:44.580
So he describes the Ukrainians
in Africanizing terms

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.510
for a very simple reason.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.530
This is when Hitler grew up.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.350
This is the kind of European
imperialism which was going on.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.270
Those are the colonies that Germany lost

00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:54.540
in the First World War,
were African colonies.

00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.660
So all down the line,

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.110
until we get to the end
of this class, it matters,

00:48:01.110 --> 00:48:03.330
you know, it matters in three ways,

00:48:03.330 --> 00:48:06.000
as I've been trying to say,
that the period between,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
let's say, 1500 and 1950 is
a period of European empire.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:17.460
It matters because events
happen on a different pace,

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.470
that things simply are connected in a way

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:21.420
that they aren't before 1500.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.220
It matters because of the
various ways people can think

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.920
about the world now that
the world is all connected.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.730
But thirdly, it also
matters because of the kind

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:37.730
of empire or the ideas of
empire that are relevant.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:39.660
Neither Hitler, and we'll get to this,

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:42.510
nor Stalin could've thought about Ukraine

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.990
the way that they did without
the European domination

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.320
of the rest of the world.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:49.470
Hitler thinks of Ukraine
in an Africanizing way.

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:52.443
When Stalin thinks of Ukraine, he says,

00:48:53.467 --> 00:48:56.610
"We don't have far-flung maritime empire

00:48:56.610 --> 00:48:58.860
the way the British and the French do.

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.080
Therefore, we have to carry out something

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.030
called internal colonization," right?

00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:05.940
So that thought, how
everyone judges that thought,

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.660
that thought is not possible
without the existence,

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.760
the transparent example,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:15.750
the simple everyday
facticity of European empire.

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:18.150
Okay, so as I say, I hope that
that wasn't too oppressive

00:49:18.150 --> 00:49:19.200
and that if it was oppressive,

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.320
it was also at least
somewhat entertaining.

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.940
This is background, right?

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:25.050
This is structure.

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.360
These are things that,
if we have them in mind,

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.040
it will help make some of the events

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.990
in our region make more sense.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.823
And don't worry.

00:49:31.823 --> 00:49:33.960
I'm going to get back to the
Kazaks and the Ottoman Empire

00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:37.290
and the Crimean Tatars
in earnest on Tuesday.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:38.310
I'm looking forward to it.

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.410
Thanks for being here.

00:49:44.096 --> 00:49:46.513
(soft music)

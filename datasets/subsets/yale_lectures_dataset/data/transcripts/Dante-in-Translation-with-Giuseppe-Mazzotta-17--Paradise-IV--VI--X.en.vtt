00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.790
Prof: With Canto IV of
Paradise,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.620
we are now in the Heaven of the
Moon,

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:21.390
which as you know by now is
also the heaven of grammar,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.940
and I will show you in what way
this is the heaven of grammar.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.920
In Paradiso III,
Dante meets two women,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.165
the empress Constance,
and the irony of the name is a

00:00:36.165 --> 00:00:40.330
little bit obvious among the
inconstant spirits,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.180
and Piccarda.
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.615
Piccarda who also had joined
the cloister had taken the name

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:52.288
of sister Constance;
she too was forced to leave the

00:00:52.288 --> 00:00:58.768
cloister on account of her
brothers, Corso Donati's

00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:01.750
political maneuvers.
 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.709
He wanted her married to an
ally of his.

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:10.159
With Canto IV,
Dante returns on this issue,

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.400
which is the issue really of
the will.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.060
What is the will?
 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:24.110
How can somebody else's force
on me, compel me to do things

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.480
that I am accountable for?
 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.480
In what way am I accountable
for somebody else's imposition

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.791
of, in this case,
his will on me,

00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.550
Dante wants to know what is the
will here?

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.340
There is another question that
forces him to--

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.080
another problem forces him to
raise a question in Canto IV,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.815
and the question is Dante's
wonder about the souls in the

00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:59.739
various stars.
 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:04.078
They are disposed and arranged
in the various planets;

00:02:04.078 --> 00:02:11.205
he sees some souls here on the
Moon, so he wonders are we in

00:02:11.205 --> 00:02:13.500
Plato's paradise?
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.788
Is this--is Plato right in
believing that the souls at

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:23.979
death return to the stars,
to the place of origin?

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:29.360
These are the two questions
that he has to raise.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.602
The canto begins with a
statement that is an

00:02:33.602 --> 00:02:37.559
extraordinary--
I will try to explain how the

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.470
two questions are related,
in what way they are related,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.830
they are not just absolutely
arbitrary.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.340
There is a sort of link between
them.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.068
Canto IV begins in a very--with
a rather strange formulation

00:02:55.068 --> 00:03:02.800
about the nature of the will and
the freedom of the will.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.495
Since that is what Piccarda's
situation had forced Dante to

00:03:07.495 --> 00:03:09.598
raise, what is the will?
 

00:03:09.598 --> 00:03:14.099
It's somebody else's will
forcing me to do something?

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.250
Am I still responsible for it?
 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.740
Dante has to clarify what the
will is, so he starts with a

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.229
statement that seems to suggest
that the will is inert.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:31.848
This is a poem that the will
cannot really make decisions,

00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:33.590
first of all.
 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.014
The will, given the opportunity
to choose between two

00:03:39.014 --> 00:03:45.586
contradictory objects of desire,
can't quite move one way or the

00:03:45.586 --> 00:03:46.628
other.
 

00:03:46.628 --> 00:03:50.180
You need the intellect,
that's the argument that makes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.199
the will take--make a decision,
will force the will to make a

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.068
decision.
 

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:59.096
And this is the way he starts,
"Between two foods at

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:03.265
equal distance and equally
tempting a free man would die of

00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:06.788
hunger before he brought either
to his lips--

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:12.415
so a lamb would stand between
the cravings of two fierce

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:15.960
wolves,
in equal fear of both."

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.288
There seems to be a kind of
will that joins human beings and

00:04:19.288 --> 00:04:21.694
animals,
such that paralyzes us,

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:25.350
the choices paralyze the will,
so that maybe when we speak

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.819
about freedom of the will we are
not speaking really about

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.307
freedom of the will,
we're speaking about the

00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:32.600
freedom of the will in the
intellect.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.533
It's the intellect that has to
be free so that's really the

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.279
argument.
 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.399
"So would a hound stand
between two does;

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.690
therefore,"
this are three images that

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.449
introduce Dante's own doubts and
perplexities.

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.194
He has two questions;
each of them seems more

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:54.069
compelling than the other and
does not know what to ask first.

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.370
"So would a hound stand
between two does;

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.925
therefore, if I kept silence,
urged equally by my doubts,

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:03.100
I neither blame nor commend
myself, since it was of

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.990
necessity.
 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.891
I was silent,
but my desire was painted on my

00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:10.714
face and with it my question,
far more warmly than in plain

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:11.769
words."
 

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:17.043
Dante is indeed talking about
the limitations of the will not

00:05:17.043 --> 00:05:21.439
that the will is--this is an
Averroist position.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.060
It's a position of a radical
interpretation of Aristotle.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.480
That the will is inert,
that you always need some kind

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.899
of-- the power of the intellect
to make you decide.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:36.249
The intellect cannot move but
the intellect can make the will

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:40.598
move so that the statement has
to be understood as one of the

00:05:40.598 --> 00:05:43.569
hierarchy between intellect and
will.

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:45.959
The argument now continues.
 

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:48.829
"Beatrice did as did
Daniel when he appeased the

00:05:48.829 --> 00:05:51.920
wrath of Nebuchadnezzar that
made him cruelly unjust,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.454
and she said:
'I see well how one desire and

00:05:55.454 --> 00:05:58.791
another draw thee,
so that thy eagerness itself

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.980
binds itself and does not get
breath.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.329
Thou reasonest:
'If the right will endures,

00:06:04.329 --> 00:06:10.158
on what ground does another's
violence lessen the measure of

00:06:10.158 --> 00:06:15.000
my desert?'"
How can it be that Piccarda,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.790
who was forced by somebody
else's will,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:23.100
seems to appear in the lowest
birth of beatitude?

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.379
She is on the Moon.
 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:30.567
Why should she be so
undeserving of a closer intimacy

00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:31.639
to God?
 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.399
That's actually his question.
 

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:37.694
"Also, it gives thee
perplexity that the souls seem

00:06:37.694 --> 00:06:40.571
to return to the stars,
in agreement with Plato's

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:41.350
teaching.
 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.440
These are the questions that
press equally on thy will.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.605
First, then,
I shall deal with that which

00:06:47.605 --> 00:06:49.230
has more poison in it."
 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.574
It's very interesting;
first of all,

00:06:51.574 --> 00:06:55.670
the language of poison that
this idea of what is dangerous

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.910
of the two questions is not the
question about the will.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.410
The question which is more
dangerous is the question that

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.160
deals with representation.
 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.766
What is the mode of appearance
of the souls in heaven and why

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:16.000
should representation--do the
souls inhabit the stars?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.930
Are they showing themselves
forth here?

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:21.550
It is a make believe that they
are here,

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.230
it's a fiction,
it's pyrotechnics if you wish,

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.699
and once the night is over then
the souls return to the proper

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.156
abode,
which or may not be visible to

00:07:33.156 --> 00:07:34.370
the pilgrim.
 

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.464
Is this a theatrical
performance, and why if this is

00:07:38.464 --> 00:07:41.997
a theatrical,
and it is, why should that be a

00:07:41.997 --> 00:07:45.209
question that has more poison in
it?

00:07:45.209 --> 00:07:49.079
What's so dangerous about
representation?

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:52.675
That's really the argument,
as Dante puts it forth,

00:07:52.675 --> 00:07:55.050
here at the beginning at least.
 

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.160
She goes on--first of all let's
discuss it and then we'll--

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.310
as we discuss it we try to
understand the question why this

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:09.338
is representation such a hard
issue.

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:13.105
She says, "Not he of the
Seraphim,"

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:16.055
this is lines--
Paradiso IV,

00:08:16.055 --> 00:08:20.153
lines 28, "that is most
made one with God,"

00:08:20.153 --> 00:08:23.958
in the choir of angels,
those who are closest to God,

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:27.675
"not Moses,
Samuel, or whichever John thou

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:28.923
wilt--
;none,"

00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:31.675
the apostle of the visionary,
the seer, "not Mary

00:08:31.675 --> 00:08:34.113
herself,
have their seat another heaven

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:37.558
from these spirits that have now
appeared to thee."

00:08:37.558 --> 00:08:40.455
This is the poetics of
Paradise,

00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:44.190
by the way, that we are really
confronted with.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:49.678
How do the souls show
themselves forth to the pilgrim?

00:08:49.678 --> 00:08:52.980
What is the mode of Dante's
representation in

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.330
Paradise?
 

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.960
"From these spirits that
have now appeared--

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.389
nor for their being have more
years or fewer,

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:03.057
but all make fair the first
circle and hold sweet life in

00:09:03.057 --> 00:09:06.658
different measure as they feel
more and less the eternal

00:09:06.658 --> 00:09:07.379
breath.
 

00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:10.270
These,"
what you are seeing here on the

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.135
Moon,
"have shown themselves

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.147
here,
not that this sphere is

00:09:15.147 --> 00:09:18.721
allotted to them,
but in sign of the heavenly

00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.759
rank that is least
exalted."

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:26.557
They have--they enjoy a lower
degree of beatitude than the

00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:31.269
other souls so they just appear
here for your benefit.

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.269
In other words,
the whole of Paradise,

00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:38.451
the representation of
Paradise if fictional and

00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:42.788
once the pilgrim disappears so
will the souls vanish.

00:09:42.788 --> 00:09:48.417
They will return into the bosom
of Abraham according to biblical

00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:49.399
accounts.
 

00:09:49.399 --> 00:09:52.836
"It is necessary,"
now Dante explains why the need

00:09:52.836 --> 00:09:56.369
for this allegorization,
this allegorical language,

00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:58.480
allegorical representation.
 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.389
"It is necessary to speak
thus to your faculty,

00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:06.620
since only from sense
perception does it grasp,

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.538
that which it then makes fit
for the intellect."

00:10:10.538 --> 00:10:16.596
The whole of Paradise is
literally an accommodation of

00:10:16.596 --> 00:10:20.979
varieties,
of realities that far exceed

00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:26.460
the powers of our mind and now
its condescension.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.370
The souls condescend to show
themselves down to us,

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:32.878
so Dante first of all,
has been talking about the

00:10:32.878 --> 00:10:35.785
limitations of the will,
now he's talking about the

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:40.481
limitations of the intellect,
so these are the two issues

00:10:40.481 --> 00:10:45.658
that join intellectually
speaking in Canto IV,

00:10:45.658 --> 00:10:50.988
and each seems to need the
other and be made stronger in

00:10:50.988 --> 00:10:53.408
the light of the other.
 

00:10:53.408 --> 00:10:58.730
Dante goes on explaining this
mode of representation,

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:01.370
which he says is not only true
for Paradise,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.664
but it's true for Scripture,
it's true for all the

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:08.097
iconography of the churches,
and that's what he says,

00:11:08.097 --> 00:11:11.750
it's necessary to speak,
"For this reason Scripture

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:14.932
condescends,"
in the literal sense of the

00:11:14.932 --> 00:11:17.168
word,
the etymological sense,

00:11:17.168 --> 00:11:18.629
it comes down to us.
 

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:22.399
It accommodates itself to our
limited faculties,

00:11:22.399 --> 00:11:26.143
"condescends to your
capacity and attributes hands

00:11:26.143 --> 00:11:28.913
and feet to God,
having another meaning,"

00:11:28.913 --> 00:11:30.820
that's the definition of an
allegory.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.830
The Bible indeed speaks of the
hand of God;

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.418
it's an anthropomorphic trope,
God has no feet and has no

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:41.779
hand, but it means it's
something else.

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:45.647
It means that power of God or
the majesty of God,

00:11:45.647 --> 00:11:47.500
the feet of God,
etc.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.147
In other words,
there is a language of

00:11:50.147 --> 00:11:54.440
representation even in the Bible
that in many ways authorizes

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.087
Dante's own juice of the
presentation.

00:11:57.087 --> 00:11:59.019
Is this clear so far?
 

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:03.519
Good, there's no real
difficulty of this issue.

00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.610
And then it continues,
"For this reason,"

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.101
it says that,
"and Holy Church,"

00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:11.618
that's what happens in the
Bible when we talk about the

00:12:11.618 --> 00:12:14.485
feet of God,
we read about the feet of God,

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:18.077
"Holy Church represents to
you with human aspect,"

00:12:18.077 --> 00:12:22.287
angels that have no human form,
"Gabriel and Michael and

00:12:22.287 --> 00:12:25.440
the other who made Tobit whole
again."

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.258
Now the distinction between the
metaphor, the platonic metaphor,

00:12:30.258 --> 00:12:32.399
and the biblical allegory.
 

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:36.327
"What Timaeus argues about
the souls is not like that which

00:12:36.327 --> 00:12:38.428
we see here;
for what he says,

00:12:38.428 --> 00:12:42.114
he seems to hold for
truth," that's already one

00:12:42.114 --> 00:12:43.558
basic difference.
 

00:12:43.558 --> 00:12:47.802
It seems that what for the
Bible is a metaphor becomes true

00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:49.850
in the context of Timaeus.
 

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.168
"He says,"
Plato says,

00:12:52.168 --> 00:12:55.440
"the soul returns to its
own star,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.347
from which he believes it to
have been separated when nature

00:12:58.347 --> 00:12:59.678
gave it for a form."
 

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:03.399
He literalizes the idea of the
souls returning--

00:13:03.399 --> 00:13:06.524
returned to the stars,
"but perhaps his view is

00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:10.202
other than his words express and
may have a meaning not to be

00:13:10.202 --> 00:13:11.000
despised.
 

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.589
If he means to return to these
wheels of the honour and the

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:18.424
blame of their influence,"
if by returning to the stars he

00:13:18.424 --> 00:13:21.519
seems to imply that at the fall
of the souls,

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:25.519
the souls go through the
various stains of the planets

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.292
and then they return to the
planets from which they

00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:32.221
originated,
"his bow perhaps strikes

00:13:32.221 --> 00:13:33.408
on a certain truth.
 

00:13:33.408 --> 00:13:34.888
This principle,
ill-understood,

00:13:34.888 --> 00:13:36.908
once he misled almost the whole
world,

00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:39.379
so that it went astray,
naming them Jupiter,

00:13:39.379 --> 00:13:41.196
and Mercury,
and Mars,"

00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:41.600
etc.
 

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.095
Dante's--then Beatrice
says--let me just continue,

00:13:45.095 --> 00:13:49.590
"'The other doubt,"
this is the language of doubts;

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.899
intellectual doubts which are
always part of truth for Dante.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:59.379
It's the truth that generates
doubt because the mind is

00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:02.700
exactly the way he described the
will;

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.345
both are restless,
both need nourishment,

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:10.537
constant nourishment,
so these are intellectual

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:11.538
doubts.
 

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:14.879
"The other doubt that
troubles thee has less

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:17.245
poison,"
he repeats this idea,

00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:18.360
less danger.
 

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.374
He hasn't said yet why the
world of representation is

00:14:21.374 --> 00:14:22.070
dangerous.
 

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.769
And actually,
he leaves it at this;

00:14:24.769 --> 00:14:27.950
"because its mischief
could not lead thee away from

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:28.240
me.
 

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.166
That our justice appears unjust
in the eyes of mortals is

00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:33.990
evidence of faith."
 

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.620
We'll go back and we'll go in a
moment.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:40.462
But let me stay with the first
question that Beatrice has

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:43.750
resolved for the pilgrim and for
us.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.476
She's distinguishing between
the theology,

00:14:47.476 --> 00:14:52.567
the biblical theology and let's
call it the philosophical

00:14:52.567 --> 00:14:55.601
allegory;
biblical allegory and

00:14:55.601 --> 00:14:57.720
philosophical allegory.
 

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:03.023
The language of metaphor in the
Bible and the language of

00:15:03.023 --> 00:15:05.580
metaphor, truth in Plato.
 

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.926
Dante himself clearly is here
legitimizing his own use of

00:15:09.926 --> 00:15:10.778
metaphor.
 

00:15:10.778 --> 00:15:16.618
The whole poem is indeed a
metaphorical journey whereby

00:15:16.618 --> 00:15:23.428
Dante is both simultaneously
biblical and also philosophical.

00:15:23.428 --> 00:15:28.020
He's finding and trying to
decide on the common ground,

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.038
the metaphorical language that
the Bible and Plato will use,

00:15:33.038 --> 00:15:35.250
and therefore himself.
 

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.980
Why is representation so
dangerous?

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.918
That it has so much poison in
it and Beatrice twice goes back

00:15:43.918 --> 00:15:46.808
to that image,
and I think that the answer is

00:15:46.808 --> 00:15:47.399
this.
 

00:15:47.399 --> 00:15:53.414
That representation has the
power to cancel or erase the

00:15:53.414 --> 00:15:58.009
world of references which it
represents.

00:15:58.009 --> 00:16:04.283
Representation has the power to
make appearances the only

00:16:04.283 --> 00:16:09.886
reality, simulacra,
the only reality that we manage

00:16:09.886 --> 00:16:11.120
to see.
 

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:17.440
It literally covers,
it eclipses all references;

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.778
that's what makes
representation so dangerous.

00:16:20.778 --> 00:16:23.982
It has a--we are by virtue of
the representation,

00:16:23.982 --> 00:16:28.120
we end up in a kind of quandary
in the predicament of believing

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.389
that that's all that there is.
 

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:34.350
That which is visible is the
only real thing,

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.245
and invest--the appearance
invest that simulacrum with the

00:16:39.245 --> 00:16:43.370
sort of value that it normally
does not have,

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.399
because it actually--it points
normally that doesn't have--

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:50.230
because it points for Dante to
essences behind it.

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:54.162
We have seen here the souls,
the souls are all--this is not

00:16:54.162 --> 00:16:57.958
the real home for the spirits,
the real home is somewhere

00:16:57.958 --> 00:16:58.570
else.
 

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:03.340
We may make the mistake Dante
made of believing that these

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.155
souls actually live on the Moon,
and therefore,

00:17:07.155 --> 00:17:09.690
that we are in a platonic other
world,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.278
in another world where the
souls go back to it.

00:17:12.278 --> 00:17:17.112
The journey of Dante is the
journey between images and

00:17:17.112 --> 00:17:20.848
testing of what these images may
mean,

00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:24.449
finding out whether behind
these images there is some kind

00:17:24.449 --> 00:17:26.680
of substance,
some kind of reality.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.660
Dante literally moves between
the two worlds and things,

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.848
images, or representations and
in appearances and the world of

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:40.808
essences,
and tries to join the two of

00:17:40.808 --> 00:17:41.440
them.
 

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.035
So you understand why
representation is the key issue

00:17:45.035 --> 00:17:45.519
here.
 

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:49.535
Let me also add that this
discourse of allegory justifies

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:52.690
and gives you an idea why Dante
has been--

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.220
that this is the heaven of
grammar,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.980
since the allegorical discourse
is a grammatical issue.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.590
Remember that I have been
talking about each planet seems

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.490
to deploy--
well, one of the liberal arts,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:12.202
but this is the reason why we
can connect grammar and the

00:18:12.202 --> 00:18:13.019
Moon.
 

00:18:13.019 --> 00:18:17.492
The other problem that Dante
raises in Canto IV is the

00:18:17.492 --> 00:18:22.345
question of the will and he--
that's an easier issue because

00:18:22.345 --> 00:18:26.220
he just goes on distinguishing
between what we call a

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.528
conditional will:
the will--

00:18:28.528 --> 00:18:32.232
what we will whenever we are
beset by circumstances that

00:18:32.232 --> 00:18:35.665
force on us some resolutions and
then absolute will:

00:18:35.665 --> 00:18:39.368
the absolute will of the
martyrs of those who are,

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.977
for instance,
who are unwavering,

00:18:41.977 --> 00:18:45.806
unfaltering in the
confrontation with particular

00:18:45.806 --> 00:18:47.108
experiences.
 

00:18:47.108 --> 00:18:52.548
The souls of this--of Piccarda
and Costanza,

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:56.690
they were really exercising
their own conditional will,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.049
not their absolute will,
so it's an interesting

00:18:59.049 --> 00:19:01.000
distinction and we leave it at
that.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.248
We move now instead to the
heaven of Canto VI,

00:19:05.248 --> 00:19:08.930
the heaven of dialectics,
of Mercury.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:14.278
Why Mercury is the--why should
he be the god,

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:19.751
this is the planet Mercury but
the god tied with dialectics or

00:19:19.751 --> 00:19:22.077
logic,
which are really not exactly

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.453
the same thing,
but Dante does use them

00:19:24.453 --> 00:19:25.528
interchangeably.
 

00:19:25.528 --> 00:19:28.652
Hermes is of course,
the god known as the

00:19:28.652 --> 00:19:32.945
psychopomp, the one who
brings--do you know that part of

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.038
mythology?
 

00:19:34.038 --> 00:19:41.680
The god who brings messages to
the realm of shades,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.420
the realm of the dead that
carries the souls to Hades,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.118
that's one of the ideas of the
resonances of Mercury.

00:19:51.118 --> 00:19:54.009
Now there is also others,
the Mercury is the god who--

00:19:54.009 --> 00:19:56.942
the bearer of laws,
the bearer of messages of the

00:19:56.942 --> 00:20:00.348
gods to human beings,
the bearer of laws,

00:20:00.348 --> 00:20:06.066
the god of the marketplace
though it doesn't seem to have

00:20:06.066 --> 00:20:10.954
much impact,
a particular resonance of the

00:20:10.954 --> 00:20:13.200
myth to this canto.
 

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.108
This is the logic--what is the
dialectics?

00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:18.980
What are we to understand by
dialectics?

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.653
It's one of the arts of the
trivium and it is the art of by

00:20:22.653 --> 00:20:26.202
which--by means of which,
which provides really a method,

00:20:26.202 --> 00:20:28.230
that's the way it's defined.
 

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.247
It provides a method to
distinguish between truth and

00:20:32.247 --> 00:20:37.269
falsehoods, so it's--let's see
how this is going to be present.

00:20:37.269 --> 00:20:40.555
Interestingly enough,
Dante is really talking about

00:20:40.555 --> 00:20:43.994
laws here,
and actually here he meets the

00:20:43.994 --> 00:20:47.827
great theorist,
the Emperor Justinian who is

00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:52.645
responsible and who is usually
acknowledged as the one who

00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:57.720
favored the real organization of
Roman law in Byzantium,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.618
which is where he lived.
 

00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:04.573
Dante not only meets Justinian
but he also tells the story of

00:21:04.573 --> 00:21:07.710
Rome, so it's a canto about
history.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:12.597
The idea is what's the
rationality of Roman history,

00:21:12.597 --> 00:21:15.568
is there a rationality to it?
 

00:21:15.568 --> 00:21:20.756
If dialectics is also the
science of the power to

00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:25.509
distinguish between falsehood
and truths,

00:21:25.509 --> 00:21:29.671
it's also a rational
discipline, the discipline that

00:21:29.671 --> 00:21:34.321
follows the rule of reason by
means of which one can go on

00:21:34.321 --> 00:21:36.769
making those distinctions.
 

00:21:36.769 --> 00:21:39.603
So the question becomes,
what is the rationality of the

00:21:39.603 --> 00:21:40.390
Roman Empire?
 

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:45.008
What kind of justice was there
in it so laws,

00:21:45.008 --> 00:21:50.570
and the same word logos,
seems to be ruling the

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.509
unfolding of this canto.
 

00:21:53.509 --> 00:21:57.740
It begins with the story of
Constantine who we have met

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.125
before for the famous--as
accountable for the donation of

00:22:02.125 --> 00:22:04.788
Constantine that you may know.
 

00:22:04.788 --> 00:22:11.882
It's the famous alienation of
imperial property to the Church

00:22:11.882 --> 00:22:18.028
for Constantine's token of
gratitude to the Pope,

00:22:18.028 --> 00:22:24.402
Sylvester, who had cured him of
leprosy and this gave rise to a

00:22:24.402 --> 00:22:28.810
famous,
much debated donation,

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:34.892
which Dante dismisses,
Dante views as nothing less

00:22:34.892 --> 00:22:37.993
transgressive,
nothing less tragic and

00:22:37.993 --> 00:22:42.386
disruptive of the order of the
world then for instance Adam's

00:22:42.386 --> 00:22:42.900
sin.
 

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.979
It's really the same cosmic
proportion because it mixes

00:22:46.979 --> 00:22:49.848
together the sacred and the
profane.

00:22:49.848 --> 00:22:55.213
It makes the Pope a temporal
ruler and that is the ultimate

00:22:55.213 --> 00:22:58.730
degradation of the moral
authority,

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:02.180
the exercise of moral authority
from Dante's viewpoint.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:05.858
So, this is the illusion to the
donation,

00:23:05.858 --> 00:23:07.980
but the illusion to the
donation here is taken into--

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:13.910
the reference to Constantine
has a slightly different sense.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.880
"After Constantine,"
he says,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.596
"turned back the eagle
against the course of heaven

00:23:19.596 --> 00:23:23.584
where it had followed behind him
of old that took Lavinia to

00:23:23.584 --> 00:23:26.507
wife,
for two hundred years or more

00:23:26.507 --> 00:23:29.220
the bird of God,"
the eagle,

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:33.479
the emblem of the Empire,
"remained on the bounds of

00:23:33.479 --> 00:23:36.263
Europe,
near the mountains from which

00:23:36.263 --> 00:23:39.673
it first came forth;
and there ruled the world under

00:23:39.673 --> 00:23:43.250
the shadow of the sacred wings,
passing from hand to hand,

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.509
and, so changing,
came into mine.

00:23:45.509 --> 00:23:51.519
I was Caesar,"
the imperial title,

00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:55.242
the imperial persona has
disappeared and now he appears

00:23:55.242 --> 00:23:57.450
as "I am Justinian."
 

00:23:57.450 --> 00:24:01.078
Here, once again,
the use of that shift of verbs

00:24:01.078 --> 00:24:04.038
from the past to the present,
"And now,

00:24:04.038 --> 00:24:06.093
I am in the eternal life,
I am myself a Justinian,

00:24:06.093 --> 00:24:08.541
"who,
by will of the Primal Love

00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:11.993
which moves me,
removed from the laws what was

00:24:11.993 --> 00:24:14.798
superfluous and"
and then made the

00:24:14.798 --> 00:24:16.348
distinction."
 

00:24:16.348 --> 00:24:18.548
This is really a definition of
dialectics.

00:24:18.548 --> 00:24:21.702
Made the distinction between
what was "superfluous and

00:24:21.702 --> 00:24:23.660
vain" and what was
essential.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:28.358
Let me give a gloss on this
first paragraph,

00:24:28.358 --> 00:24:32.568
the allusion is to
Constantine's moving,

00:24:32.568 --> 00:24:35.279
that's the other sense,
not only the donation,

00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:41.205
but moving the seat of the
empire from Rome to the east,

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:42.500
Byzantium.
 

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:51.105
This is seen as the violation
of a metaphor of history,

00:24:51.105 --> 00:24:57.162
a paradigm of history,
which was called

00:24:57.162 --> 00:25:03.059
translatio
imperii.

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:05.140
What is this? What does it mean?
 

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.861
It's the idea of,
you know in the Middle Ages

00:25:07.861 --> 00:25:11.386
they speak of translation,
all the time the translation of

00:25:11.386 --> 00:25:13.798
studies, translation of the
empire.

00:25:13.798 --> 00:25:17.930
The idea that the whole of
history follows a pattern,

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.828
a movement from east to west,
and therefore,

00:25:22.828 --> 00:25:28.065
the duration of history is
patterned on the movement of the

00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:33.390
Sun from east to west and with
the idea that when the empire

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:39.393
reaches the most western point,
the western most point of the

00:25:39.393 --> 00:25:43.950
map that's going to be also the
end of history.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.958
It's the end of the day,
the sunset, and the end of

00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:47.558
history.
 

00:25:47.558 --> 00:25:50.902
Constantine,
by turning back this

00:25:50.902 --> 00:25:53.067
translation,
this movement,

00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:55.336
that's what it means,
a transport,

00:25:55.336 --> 00:26:01.239
a transfer of the Empire
actually delays the apocalyptic

00:26:01.239 --> 00:26:05.426
denuma,
the end of time and the end of

00:26:05.426 --> 00:26:08.824
the day,
and for Dante this is a major

00:26:08.824 --> 00:26:11.880
violation of the economy of
history.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:17.065
It begins with this idea of a
violation, a tragic violation of

00:26:17.065 --> 00:26:20.380
history brought about by
Constantine.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:24.190
The allusion of course is--the
other illusion is to Aeneas with

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:27.448
whom the Empire had started
after the fall of Troy had

00:26:27.448 --> 00:26:31.012
started to go westward and then
Constantine reverses all of

00:26:31.012 --> 00:26:31.690
this.
 

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.036
You understand,
by the way, this is--I mean,

00:26:35.036 --> 00:26:38.952
this as on Election Day;
I really should mention this,

00:26:38.952 --> 00:26:43.002
that the whole idea of manifest
destiny is really based on this

00:26:43.002 --> 00:26:45.157
principle of the
translatio

00:26:45.157 --> 00:26:48.571
imperii,
because the Empire moves

00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:50.529
westward all the time.
 

00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:57.615
We are now, therefore,
in the proper compass of

00:26:57.615 --> 00:27:01.160
history, so to speak.
 

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.920
So, Constantine,
with the Lavinia who went

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:10.098
backwards, Lavinia wife of
Aeneas.

00:27:10.098 --> 00:27:13.430
I must also indicate to you,
and this would become--

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:16.308
if case you are still looking
for a topic,

00:27:16.308 --> 00:27:20.078
this is one of the first times
that Dante starts using this

00:27:20.078 --> 00:27:23.838
geographical coordinates,
the geographical description of

00:27:23.838 --> 00:27:24.338
Europe.
 

00:27:24.338 --> 00:27:29.779
He has really not done that
neither in Inferno nor in

00:27:29.779 --> 00:27:33.744
Purgatorio,
but now Europe becomes an

00:27:33.744 --> 00:27:36.420
increased concern of his.
 

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.660
Whatever historical information
they have of it and it's--

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:47.645
this is the Europe at the east
and Dante will be talking about

00:27:47.645 --> 00:27:51.769
the borders of Europe in the
west.

00:27:51.769 --> 00:27:58.634
There is a kind of idea of a
Europe that has--he's asking

00:27:58.634 --> 00:28:05.498
what kind of messages can come
from Europe which is still

00:28:05.498 --> 00:28:08.930
valid, legitimate today.
 

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.364
These are the sort of
incredible questions that he

00:28:12.364 --> 00:28:16.150
will ask and distinguishes
between Rome and Europe,

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.440
in the sense that Rome,
he will say,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.848
in a political tract that he
writes,

00:28:21.848 --> 00:28:25.378
that the history of Rome is
different from the history of

00:28:25.378 --> 00:28:29.010
Europe,
1320 he writes this kind of

00:28:29.010 --> 00:28:32.269
thing;
1318 maybe he writes this tract.

00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:40.305
The emblem for Europe's--for
Rome's distinctiveness is to be

00:28:40.305 --> 00:28:47.660
found in Aeneas' experience of
marrying three wives.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.767
He marries Creusa,
as we'll hear from the

00:28:50.767 --> 00:28:53.448
Aeneid;
he marries Dido,

00:28:53.448 --> 00:28:58.573
though it's a marriage of
convenience so to speak but it's

00:28:58.573 --> 00:29:02.440
a marriage, and then he marries
Lavinia.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.998
Dante goes on to explain the
three wives he marries are one

00:29:06.998 --> 00:29:09.641
from Asia,
one from Africa,

00:29:09.641 --> 00:29:13.529
and one from Europe,
so that Aeneas' whole

00:29:13.529 --> 00:29:18.038
experience, whole history
encompasses what at the time was

00:29:18.038 --> 00:29:22.563
thought of as universality,
the three known continents in a

00:29:22.563 --> 00:29:25.578
way of which only Europe,
Europe is only a part,

00:29:25.578 --> 00:29:26.788
so keep that in mind.
 

00:29:26.788 --> 00:29:29.970
I will talk more about this
metaphor as it appears.

00:29:29.970 --> 00:29:35.584
Now this is the context of
Europe, so Justinian and the

00:29:35.584 --> 00:29:41.925
reference to his reorganization
of the Roman code known as the

00:29:41.925 --> 00:29:48.578
Justinian Code and then now we
have a history of the Empire.

00:29:48.578 --> 00:29:52.587
From the emperor we have what
seems to be a celebration of the

00:29:52.587 --> 00:29:54.660
Roman Empire,
this is Canto VI,

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:58.019
therefore like Canto VI of
Inferno and Canto VI of

00:29:58.019 --> 00:30:00.759
Purgatorio,
the focus is political;

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:05.730
it's not just the city or Italy
now, it's the whole Empire.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.057
But what begins as a
celebration of the empire in

00:30:10.057 --> 00:30:15.017
effect turns out to be a
critique of the ideology of the

00:30:15.017 --> 00:30:18.652
Empire,
the mythological reading that

00:30:18.652 --> 00:30:22.788
we can find in Augustine's
Confessions.

00:30:22.788 --> 00:30:26.844
Dante follows two models here
and they are two models that are

00:30:26.844 --> 00:30:30.699
contradictory with each other
and in this representation of

00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:34.818
Canto VI we have the Virgilian
model of the Roman Empire,

00:30:34.818 --> 00:30:38.660
which is really a celebration
of its origins with Aeneas,

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.410
with Pallas,
the whole account told in the

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.098
Aeneid and with the
vision of what is to come.

00:30:45.098 --> 00:30:48.117
But then there is,
around the fifth century,

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:48.538
A.D.
 

00:30:48.538 --> 00:30:52.775
Augustine writes in The City
of God, a fierce critique of

00:30:52.775 --> 00:30:53.650
the Empire.
 

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.159
The Empire has fallen,
the claims by the time

00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:59.361
Augustine writes,
the claims of the eternity of

00:30:59.361 --> 00:31:01.848
the Empire turn out to be
Apollo,

00:31:01.848 --> 00:31:06.842
and to Augustine the Empire is
nothing less than another one

00:31:06.842 --> 00:31:10.871
of--
another episode in a long

00:31:10.871 --> 00:31:18.759
history of predatory politics of
imperial possessions and

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:20.450
violence.
 

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:24.800
The Roman Empire as an empire
is no better than all the other

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.936
empires that have long been--
have long vanished and

00:31:28.936 --> 00:31:33.250
vanquished so this is the--
these are the two models that

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:34.368
Dante's evoking.
 

00:31:34.368 --> 00:31:37.058
In fact, the very language,
just to give you an idea,

00:31:37.058 --> 00:31:41.085
at one point Dante will say,
"Thou knowest,"

00:31:41.085 --> 00:31:44.509
lines 35 and following,
"that it made its

00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:48.169
stay," the eagle,
the story is told through the

00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:51.416
vicissitudes of this emblem,
of the symbolic emblem,

00:31:51.416 --> 00:31:53.848
the eagle, "for three
hundred years or more,

00:31:53.848 --> 00:31:55.880
til at the last,
still for its sake,

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.940
the three,"
the razi,

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.630
you may know a little bit of
Roman History,

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.691
the Curiazi,
who fight it out with a duel

00:32:02.691 --> 00:32:05.680
between the three brothers and
the other three brothers.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.240
"The three fought with the
three,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.721
and thou knowest what it did
under seven kings,"

00:32:09.721 --> 00:32:13.054
the story of the seven kings,
"from the wrongs of the

00:32:13.054 --> 00:32:15.440
Sabine women to the woe of
Lucrece,

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.630
conquering the neighbour
peoples round about."

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:23.593
These are all phrases that come
straight out of Augustine's

00:32:23.593 --> 00:32:25.390
City of God.
 

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:30.961
They are used as cases of
exemplifying the libido of power

00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:31.940
of Rome.
 

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:34.970
There are erotic stories,
stories of erotic violence;

00:32:34.970 --> 00:32:39.433
Lucretia, who has been raped,
and the story of the Sabine

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:44.457
women who have been kidnapped by
the bands of Romulus and Remus,

00:32:44.457 --> 00:32:46.769
and they are the outlaws.
 

00:32:46.769 --> 00:32:51.727
There is this idea that the
Empire was born in the condition

00:32:51.727 --> 00:32:52.818
of outlaws.
 

00:32:52.818 --> 00:32:57.738
Dante is using the perspective
of Augustine because Augustine

00:32:57.738 --> 00:33:02.246
had used these examples to them,
the Empire, and its own

00:33:02.246 --> 00:33:04.048
aberrant policies.
 

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:07.069
At the same time,
all the rest is really

00:33:07.069 --> 00:33:09.347
Virgilian;
this is the moment when Virgil

00:33:09.347 --> 00:33:11.460
and Augustine really disagree
from each other.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.278
Why does Dante do this?
 

00:33:13.278 --> 00:33:17.707
What is this--what is the
reason for bringing together two

00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:21.278
contradictory sources of
historical thought?

00:33:21.278 --> 00:33:25.160
What's the idea of poetic
mythology of Rome?

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.970
Is he in favor of the Empire or
is he against the Empire?

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.298
Is he with Augustine or is he
with--actually with Virgil?

00:33:33.298 --> 00:33:36.910
One thing is clear,
that Augustine who loves

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.940
Virgil, of course,
decides that this is--that the

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.390
Empire is an aberrant reality in
his own history.

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:50.930
It's already falling apart and
he has no use for this.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:55.813
In his theological vision,
the question that he raises is,

00:33:55.813 --> 00:34:00.868
what do I care who governs me,
provided this is he that they

00:34:00.868 --> 00:34:02.838
do not make me sin.
 

00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:06.250
The reality is an internalized
reality.

00:34:06.250 --> 00:34:10.655
The reality is the one which is
in the interior life of all of

00:34:10.655 --> 00:34:14.050
us and what are empires,
if not great thefts?

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:20.021
He will go on dismissing all of
this, he a Roman citizen at the

00:34:20.021 --> 00:34:25.610
end, at the twilight of the
Empire, sixth century or so.

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:29.699
What is--where does Dante stand
in between them?

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:30.523
He continues.
 

00:34:30.523 --> 00:34:32.110
I have an answer I hope.
 

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.927
He continues for now;
he doesn't tell us yet,

00:34:35.927 --> 00:34:40.487
"Thou knowest what it did
when borne by the illustrious

00:34:40.487 --> 00:34:45.202
Romans against Brennus…
It brought low the pride of the

00:34:45.202 --> 00:34:49.646
Arabs,
who behind Hannibal passed the

00:34:49.646 --> 00:34:54.690
Alpine crags from which,
Po, thou fallest.

00:34:54.690 --> 00:34:58.469
Under it, as youths Scipio and
Pompey triumphed…

00:34:58.469 --> 00:35:00.849
Then near the time,"
etc.,

00:35:00.849 --> 00:35:07.847
this will continue into the
violation of the Rubicon by

00:35:07.847 --> 00:35:11.445
Caesar and it--
then it goes on with

00:35:11.445 --> 00:35:15.146
Charlemagne, line 95 and
following and now let me just

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:17.800
read the passage,
the last passage.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.425
"Now thou canst judge of
such men as I accused before,

00:35:21.425 --> 00:35:24.737
and of their offenses,
which are the cause of all your

00:35:24.737 --> 00:35:27.123
ills;
the one opposes to the public

00:35:27.123 --> 00:35:30.458
standard the yellow lilies and
the other claims,"

00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:33.235
lilies of France,
"and the other claims it

00:35:33.235 --> 00:35:35.577
for a party,
so that it is hard to see which

00:35:35.577 --> 00:35:36.530
offends the more.
 

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.063
Let the Ghibellines,"
the canto all of a sudden

00:35:40.063 --> 00:35:43.759
becomes evocative;
seems to turn into a replica of

00:35:43.759 --> 00:35:47.632
Inferno VI of the Civil
War between Guelfs and

00:35:47.632 --> 00:35:48.750
Ghibellines.
 

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:54.048
It starts as a celebration,
an encomium of the Empire and

00:35:54.048 --> 00:35:58.307
its role in history,
in this westward movement

00:35:58.307 --> 00:36:01.809
toward an apocalyptic
conclusion.

00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:03.750
Now all of a sudden it goes
back to,

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.981
"Let the Ghibellines carry
on their arts under another

00:36:06.981 --> 00:36:09.257
standard,
for of this he's always a bad

00:36:09.257 --> 00:36:11.309
follower who serves it from
justice;

00:36:11.309 --> 00:36:14.833
and let not this new Charles
strike at it with his Guelfs,

00:36:14.833 --> 00:36:18.358
but let him fear its claws
which have torn the hide from a

00:36:18.358 --> 00:36:19.409
greater lion.
 

00:36:19.409 --> 00:36:23.500
Many a time ere now have the
children wept for the father's

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.449
fault, and let him not think God
will change arms for his

00:36:27.449 --> 00:36:28.650
lilies."
 

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.360
What is this?
 

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:33.059
It starts with the Empire,
ends up with the civil war,

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:38.170
and the civil war is really the
perspective from which Dante can

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:42.550
take this double view on the
history of the Empire,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:49.731
where Dante can really stand up
to the stance of Augustine and

00:36:49.731 --> 00:36:52.440
the stance of Virgil.
 

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.510
What he really seems to be
saying I think is this,

00:36:56.510 --> 00:37:02.219
yes Augustine you are right,
that the Empire is really a

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:06.152
negative force--
has been a negative force in

00:37:06.152 --> 00:37:10.983
history and that the reality is,
as you say, an internalized

00:37:10.983 --> 00:37:16.235
reality of our own peace and the
kind of internal will that we

00:37:16.235 --> 00:37:18.820
can-- we manage to placate.
 

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.809
At the same time,
he says to Virgil but you're

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:28.396
also right in your valorization
of the Empire because the Empire

00:37:28.396 --> 00:37:33.449
has brought about some order and
laws into the world.

00:37:33.449 --> 00:37:39.175
That's the argument,
and yet, against Augustine he

00:37:39.175 --> 00:37:43.054
says,
if there were no laws and there

00:37:43.054 --> 00:37:47.943
were no laws of the Empire,
then there would be no way of

00:37:47.943 --> 00:37:52.139
sheltering each and every unrest
in case of a civil war.

00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:57.182
What makes the argument for the
necessity of the Empire is the

00:37:57.182 --> 00:38:02.309
reality of the civil war which
really demands the presence of a

00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:06.856
transcendent institution that
will manage to contain the

00:38:06.856 --> 00:38:09.420
violence of human beings.
 

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.414
You can see he agrees with
Augustine and disagrees with

00:38:12.414 --> 00:38:13.079
Augustine.
 

00:38:13.079 --> 00:38:15.599
He agrees with Virgil and
disagrees with Virgil.

00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:21.726
Virgil leaves no room for the
internal, the inner experiences

00:38:21.726 --> 00:38:23.360
of Christians.
 

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.170
On the other hand,
Augustine leaves no room for

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:31.893
the necessity of an outside
structure that could order the

00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:34.380
appetites of human beings.
 

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:39.610
The canto though comes to an
end with a little bit of an

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:44.840
autobiographical poetry,
an autobiographical picture.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.610
This is now the emperor who
praises a counselor,

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:55.889
a counselor who has fallen into
disgrace.

00:38:55.889 --> 00:39:00.108
"'Within the same pearl
shines too the light of

00:39:00.108 --> 00:39:05.000
Romeo," Romeo Villeneuve,
a Provencal courtier,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.347
who had the role of exactly
being a counselor for the

00:39:10.347 --> 00:39:12.641
prince,
"whose great and noble

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:15.666
work was ill rewarded;
but the Provencals who wrought

00:39:15.666 --> 00:39:18.110
against him do not have the
laugh,

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.769
and indeed he takes an ill road
who makes of another's

00:39:21.769 --> 00:39:23.980
well-doing a wrong to himself.
 

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:28.188
Raymond Berenger had four
daughters, each of them a queen,

00:39:28.188 --> 00:39:31.438
and Romeo, a man of low birth
and a stranger,

00:39:31.438 --> 00:39:32.989
did this for him.
 

00:39:32.989 --> 00:39:38.137
And when crafty tongues moved
him to call to account this just

00:39:38.137 --> 00:39:41.849
man, who rendered him seven and
five for ten,

00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:46.940
Romeo left there poor and old;
and if the world knew the heart

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.166
he had, begging his bread by
morsels, much as it praises him

00:39:51.166 --> 00:39:56.108
would praise him more.'"
It is an oblique representation

00:39:56.108 --> 00:40:00.862
of Dante himself,
who has to end up begging in

00:40:00.862 --> 00:40:06.195
poverty for a morsel,
as he says, out of the

00:40:06.195 --> 00:40:10.780
selfishness of the political
powers.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.688
The other final question that I
think underlies this whole canto

00:40:15.688 --> 00:40:19.382
that has to be raised is,
what is the relationship

00:40:19.382 --> 00:40:22.849
between dialectics and this
representation of history?

00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:26.239
Why should Dante connect the
two?

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:30.088
Why in the heaven of logic,
let's say, does he have to talk

00:40:30.088 --> 00:40:31.150
about history?
 

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:35.682
I think that the idea is that
history itself,

00:40:35.682 --> 00:40:41.864
I think that he's--this is an
encomium that ends up being not

00:40:41.864 --> 00:40:45.059
quite a mitigated encomium.
 

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:47.809
It's also a critique of the
Empire,

00:40:47.809 --> 00:40:52.202
that there is a reason within
the Empire and yet this reason

00:40:52.202 --> 00:40:56.295
doesn't quite justify all that
the Empire perpetrated in

00:40:56.295 --> 00:40:57.190
history.
 

00:40:57.190 --> 00:41:02.443
I think from this perspective
Dante is also forcing on us some

00:41:02.443 --> 00:41:08.300
perplexities about the nature of
logic as an instrument of power,

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.030
as one that could justify all
possible powers.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:18.757
So there is also a critique of
dialectics as much as there is a

00:41:18.757 --> 00:41:20.789
critique of history.
 

00:41:20.789 --> 00:41:25.010
We skip altogether,
because I think it's a little

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.599
bit more evident,
and you can,

00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:32.130
if you read on your own,
you can see Canto VIII and IX,

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:37.960
the canto of rhetoric and the
rhetoric and love they are very,

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.869
IX especially, very clear.
 

00:41:39.869 --> 00:41:41.500
We move instead to the Heaven
of the Sun,

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.768
she's a little bit--X,
XI and XII are--

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:47.829
I don't know that I'll be able
to finish all of Canto X but I

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:49.409
want to start the discussion.
 

00:41:49.409 --> 00:41:54.786
We are in the Heaven of the
Sun, which is the heaven of

00:41:54.786 --> 00:41:58.768
arithmetic,
numbers and here Dante goes on

00:41:58.768 --> 00:42:04.030
talking about one model of the
Trinity that I will describe to

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:05.670
you in a moment.
 

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:10.989
Dante encounters the wise
spirits, the spirits of--

00:42:10.989 --> 00:42:16.550
in fact we are going to see
very soon there are two wheels

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.612
of saints,
two garlands,

00:42:18.612 --> 00:42:22.266
represented as two garlands of
old men who hold themselves by

00:42:22.266 --> 00:42:26.000
the hand,
dancing around the Sun.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.789
It is the dance of wisdom,
if you wish.

00:42:28.789 --> 00:42:33.023
You can call it--you can also
refer to it as a kind of

00:42:33.023 --> 00:42:35.980
reorganization of the
encyclopedia.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.141
You may remember that I used
this metaphor at the beginning

00:42:39.141 --> 00:42:42.389
of the course,
this idea that the Divine

00:42:42.389 --> 00:42:47.280
Comedy tries to re-propose a
new circle of knowledge,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.329
a way in which things can
really be known and the

00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:55.940
encyclopedia means the journey,
education, as in a circle

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.911
because the mind moves around
through the various arts and

00:42:59.911 --> 00:43:02.280
sciences, that's how you learn.
 

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.418
You return to what you already
knew from a different viewpoint

00:43:06.418 --> 00:43:08.929
and you see things,
things are new.

00:43:08.929 --> 00:43:11.230
But it's the Heaven of the Sun.
 

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:16.835
Let me just go on a little bit
with the canto and then we'll

00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:21.489
try to bring out some of the
issues of Canto X.

00:43:21.489 --> 00:43:25.530
"Looking on His Son with
the Love,

00:43:25.530 --> 00:43:29.380
which the One and the Other
eternally breathe forth,

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:34.722
the primal and ineffable Power
made with such order all that

00:43:34.722 --> 00:43:39.375
revolves in mind or space,
that he who contemplates it

00:43:39.375 --> 00:43:41.699
cannot but taste of Him."
 

00:43:41.699 --> 00:43:45.152
He begins with a Trinitarian
representation,

00:43:45.152 --> 00:43:49.085
the Father, the Son,
joined together by the breath

00:43:49.085 --> 00:43:50.050
of love.
 

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:54.679
That was the idea of the
Trinity, which is a unity;

00:43:54.679 --> 00:43:59.068
that's the paradoxes of
arithmetic, of this theological

00:43:59.068 --> 00:44:02.239
arithmetic, as an image of
fecundity.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:07.885
God is being an image of love,
is generative of itself,

00:44:07.885 --> 00:44:10.289
within His own unity.
 

00:44:10.289 --> 00:44:13.581
Then Dante turns to us,
and that's the last time I

00:44:13.581 --> 00:44:17.411
believe that he turns to us
readers, and he tells us to be

00:44:17.411 --> 00:44:18.152
stargazers.
 

00:44:18.152 --> 00:44:18.891
That's all.
 

00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:20.840
That's all he's saying.
 

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.460
"Lift up thine eyes with
me then,

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.963
reader, to the lofty wheels,
directing them on that part

00:44:26.963 --> 00:44:29.639
where the one motion strikes the
other,

00:44:29.639 --> 00:44:32.652
and from that point take thy
pleasure in the art of the

00:44:32.652 --> 00:44:35.054
Master,
who so loves it in His heart

00:44:35.054 --> 00:44:37.030
that His eye never leaves it.
 

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:40.925
See how from there the circle
branches obliquely that bears

00:44:40.925 --> 00:44:45.090
the planets to satisfy the world
which calls for them."

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:50.320
He directs our eyes to an
intersection of the ecliptic,

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.090
the cosmic equator,
and the ecliptic,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:57.731
the ecliptic being a term that
describes the diurnal and annual

00:44:57.731 --> 00:44:59.380
movement of the Sun.
 

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.795
Where they meet,
that crossing,

00:45:01.795 --> 00:45:06.387
that directs our eyes there,
"if their track were not

00:45:06.387 --> 00:45:08.159
aslant,"
etc.

00:45:08.159 --> 00:45:10.699
"Stay now,
reader, on thy bench,

00:45:10.699 --> 00:45:13.268
thinking over this of which
thou hast the foretaste,

00:45:13.268 --> 00:45:16.599
and thou shalt have much
delight before thou art weary;

00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:19.181
I have set before thee,
now feed thyself,

00:45:19.181 --> 00:45:22.989
for the theme of which I am
made the scribes bends to itself

00:45:22.989 --> 00:45:24.409
all my care."
 

00:45:24.409 --> 00:45:29.675
Why does Dante think of the
Trinity in the Heaven of the

00:45:29.675 --> 00:45:30.250
Sun?
 

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:34.139
This is the simple question
that we should ask;

00:45:34.139 --> 00:45:36.739
I have a passage that I want to
read to you.

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:41.731
It's taken from--I think this
is the--it's taken from the

00:45:41.731 --> 00:45:45.652
pseudo Dionysius,
you may have heard of--whom

00:45:45.652 --> 00:45:49.039
Dante will mention,
he's a mystic.

00:45:49.039 --> 00:45:54.746
He writes on the divine names,
he writes about how the

00:45:54.746 --> 00:46:01.637
mystical hierarchy and this will
be explained to you a little bit

00:46:01.637 --> 00:46:05.523
of the--
what is Dante's,

00:46:05.523 --> 00:46:12.010
at this point,
semi-mystical theology,

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:17.090
semi-mystical idea of the
Trinity, this idea that

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.949
knowledge has to be love.
 

00:46:19.949 --> 00:46:23.619
He begins with an idea of the
Trinity bound by love and that

00:46:23.619 --> 00:46:25.300
knowledge has to be love.
 

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:29.449
Let me read this passage and
maybe we can go from there.

00:46:29.449 --> 00:46:32.650
I call it a solar theology.
 

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:36.961
That is to say,
a theology of the Sun,

00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:42.012
not about the Sun but solar;
the theology has to be

00:46:42.012 --> 00:46:44.980
understood as the life of the
Sun itself.

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.945
Let me read this passage,
"Think,"

00:46:48.945 --> 00:46:54.018
this is from 693B of the divine
names and following,

00:46:54.018 --> 00:46:57.329
"Think of how it is with
our sun.

00:46:57.329 --> 00:47:04.469
It exercises no rational
process, no act of choice,

00:47:04.469 --> 00:47:10.664
and yet by the very fact of its
existence it gives light to

00:47:10.664 --> 00:47:16.860
whatever is able to partake of
its light in its own way.

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:20.846
So it is with the Dood,"
a classical comparison here of

00:47:20.846 --> 00:47:24.967
course of the Sun with the good
in the republic of Protinus in

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.130
the Aeneid and so on.
 

00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.670
"So it is with the Good.
 

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:33.529
Existing far above the sun,
an archetype far superior to

00:47:33.529 --> 00:47:37.226
its dull image,
it sends the rays of its

00:47:37.226 --> 00:47:41.880
undivided goodness to everything
with the capacity,

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.266
such as this may be,
to receive it…

00:47:45.266 --> 00:47:49.561
Such beings owe the presence
and their uneclipsed and

00:47:49.561 --> 00:47:54.271
undiminished lives to these
rays… They abide in the

00:47:54.271 --> 00:48:00.219
goodness of God and draw from it
the foundation of what they are,

00:48:00.219 --> 00:48:03.155
their coherence,
their vigilance,

00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:04.349
their home.
 

00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:07.740
Their longing for the Good
makes them what they are and

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:09.940
confers on them their
well-being.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:15.800
Shaped by what they yearn for,
they exemplify goodness,

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.340
and as the Law of God requires
of them,

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.856
they share with those below
them the good gifts which have

00:48:22.856 --> 00:48:24.679
come their way."
 

00:48:24.679 --> 00:48:28.679
I call it a solar theology in
the sense that Dante is the--

00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:32.969
I think, thinking of theology
as--or God,

00:48:32.969 --> 00:48:37.079
or the Trinity as a given,
as a fountain,

00:48:37.079 --> 00:48:43.766
not the Aristotelian or mystic
or Augustinian idea of

00:48:43.766 --> 00:48:45.309
causality.
 

00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:50.099
We think of God as the one who
imparts a cause or a motion to

00:48:50.099 --> 00:48:54.253
things, or a beginning and then
you have a teliology,

00:48:54.253 --> 00:48:55.849
you have effect.
 

00:48:55.849 --> 00:49:01.536
The idea of the Trinity here is
one of an inexhaustible source

00:49:01.536 --> 00:49:06.943
that keeps giving and it gives
to all and we're all part of

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.250
this gift.
 

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:09.599
This is the idea.
 

00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:12.039
I think that Dante is getting
this,

00:49:12.039 --> 00:49:17.000
what I call the solar theology,
from a mystical text called the

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.838
pseudo Dionysius,
again not that he is a mystic,

00:49:20.838 --> 00:49:25.092
but he indeed appears as one
who behind is the rationalist

00:49:25.092 --> 00:49:30.449
façade of his thinking,
he's aware of depths and other

00:49:30.449 --> 00:49:36.090
ways of thinking which are not
those of the rational route.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:41.059
Let me just go from and
describe even more here what

00:49:41.059 --> 00:49:43.789
happens with this Canto X.
 

00:49:43.789 --> 00:49:59.487
Now Dante goes on seeing these
two garlands of saints and this

00:49:59.487 --> 00:50:07.244
is--let me read;
he meets Aquinas and let me

00:50:07.244 --> 00:50:14.117
read from this passage where he,
Aquinas, will go on giving and

00:50:14.117 --> 00:50:19.556
naming the first encyclopedic,
this movement of sages,

00:50:19.556 --> 00:50:23.570
lines 100 and following where
he says,

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.329
"I was of the lambs of the
holy flock that Dominic leads on

00:50:27.329 --> 00:50:31.030
the path where there is good
fattening if they do not stray;

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:35.150
he that is next beside me on
the right was my brother and

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:39.050
master, Albert of Cologne,
and I am Thomas Aquinas.

00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.039
If thou wouldst be thus
informed of all the rest,

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:45.713
fall after my words with thine
eyes, going round the blessed

00:50:45.713 --> 00:50:46.400
wreath.
 

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.239
That next flame comes from the
smile of Gratian,

00:50:50.239 --> 00:50:53.340
who served,"
canon law and civil law,

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.800
"the one and the other
court so well that it gives

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.119
pleasure in Paradise;
the other who next adorns our

00:50:59.119 --> 00:51:02.717
choire was that Peter,
who like the poor widow,

00:51:02.717 --> 00:51:05.768
offered his treasure to Holy
Church.

00:51:05.768 --> 00:51:09.280
The fifth light,
which is the most beautiful

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:14.096
among us, breathes from such a
love that all the world below

00:51:14.096 --> 00:51:18.960
hungers for news of it;
within it is the lofty mind to

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:23.664
which was given wisdom so deep
that, if truth be true,

00:51:23.664 --> 00:51:28.190
there never arose a second of
such vision."

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:33.351
It's Solomon described through
a circumlocution as the fifth

00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:36.364
light,
and the fifth light because in

00:51:36.364 --> 00:51:40.590
numerical symbolism five stands
for the natural number,

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.280
which is to say,
that Dante casts very difficult

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.688
proposition,
Solomon as being naturally

00:51:48.688 --> 00:51:52.088
perfect,
having a kind of perfection of

00:51:52.088 --> 00:51:52.880
intellect.
 

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:56.530
It's a dangerous proposition.
 

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.266
In fact, Dante will go
on--Aquinas will go on in Canto

00:52:00.266 --> 00:52:02.778
XIV,
look let me just explain what I

00:52:02.778 --> 00:52:06.492
said before because it's not
quite true because the virtue

00:52:06.492 --> 00:52:08.581
of--
the intellectual virtue of

00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:12.099
Solomon consists in the fact
that he knew what to ask for

00:52:12.099 --> 00:52:14.360
when he had to govern his
people.

00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:18.219
He was the perfect king because
he knew what to ask.

00:52:18.219 --> 00:52:21.518
You understand why this would
be a dangerous idea?

00:52:21.518 --> 00:52:25.003
If you believe that there is a
perfection of the intellect

00:52:25.003 --> 00:52:27.659
within the natural imminence,
fear, order,

00:52:27.659 --> 00:52:30.632
where we live then it means
that there's no need for

00:52:30.632 --> 00:52:31.449
Revelation.
 

00:52:31.449 --> 00:52:33.905
There is no need for
intermediaries,

00:52:33.905 --> 00:52:35.659
no need for Redemption.
 

00:52:35.659 --> 00:52:38.965
If nature, the natural
intellect, is capable of

00:52:38.965 --> 00:52:43.206
ascending as it has claimed here
for Solomon, then the whole

00:52:43.206 --> 00:52:45.219
apparatus will collapse.
 

00:52:45.219 --> 00:52:48.148
Dante will not believe it and
Aquinas will go back as

00:52:48.148 --> 00:52:51.266
dramatically,
actually in Canto XIII saying,

00:52:51.266 --> 00:52:55.940
let me just explain myself,
"Beside it is the light of

00:52:55.940 --> 00:53:00.349
the candle which below in the
flesh was farthest,"

00:53:00.349 --> 00:53:04.559
this is Augustine and then,
"the body from which he

00:53:04.559 --> 00:53:06.960
was driven lies below in
Cieldauro,"

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.952
this is Boethius,
"and he came from

00:53:09.952 --> 00:53:12.710
martyrdom and exile to this
peace.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.215
See, flaming beyond,
the glowing breath of Isidore,

00:53:16.215 --> 00:53:18.389
of Bede, and of Richard [of St.
 

00:53:18.389 --> 00:53:20.914
Victor]
who in contemplation was more

00:53:20.914 --> 00:53:23.090
than man,"
line 132,

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.771
then read this line because I
think it's a little bit more

00:53:25.771 --> 00:53:28.219
interesting in the Italian than
it is in English,

00:53:28.219 --> 00:53:31.514
"in contemplation was more
than man,"

00:53:31.514 --> 00:53:34.237
"d'Isidoro,
di Beda e di Riccardo,

00:53:34.237 --> 00:53:37.820
che a considerar fu più
che vero."

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:39.500
The word Dante uses is not
contemplation,

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:43.335
it's consideration,
and it's a key word for Dante

00:53:43.335 --> 00:53:48.130
whose consideration means the
etymologies that of moving with

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:49.250
the stars.
 

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:53.779
That is if the mind is at its
most perfect when it imitates

00:53:53.779 --> 00:53:57.449
the circulation and circularity
of the stars;

00:53:57.449 --> 00:54:00.929
consider, it's also like desire
by the way.

00:54:00.929 --> 00:54:05.054
"This one from whom thy
look returns to me is the light

00:54:05.054 --> 00:54:07.992
of a spirit to whom,
in his grave thoughts,

00:54:07.992 --> 00:54:11.773
dealt seemed slow in coming;
it is the eternal light of

00:54:11.773 --> 00:54:14.385
Siger, who, lecturing in the
Street of Straw,

00:54:14.385 --> 00:54:16.699
demonstrated invidious
truths."

00:54:16.699 --> 00:54:22.385
The last one that Aquinas
points out in this circulation

00:54:22.385 --> 00:54:28.485
of wise spirits is one of a
so-called heretic by the name of

00:54:28.485 --> 00:54:33.137
Siger of Brabant,
who was an Averroist and was

00:54:33.137 --> 00:54:35.599
condemned for his Averroism.
 

00:54:35.599 --> 00:54:40.110
Whatever knowledge and whatever
canonized knowledge we may have,

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.925
for Dante it includes figures
who have been judged unworthy of

00:54:44.925 --> 00:54:49.739
knowledge or heretical or wrong
and now they are retrieved.

00:54:49.739 --> 00:54:53.250
The idea of knowledge is one
that keeps changing.

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.867
The idea of the canor of
knowledge keeps always expanding

00:54:56.867 --> 00:54:59.840
and including voices that had
been rejected.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.369
Let me tell you more about this
representation of Siger of

00:55:03.369 --> 00:55:03.989
Brabant.
 

00:55:03.989 --> 00:55:07.315
You understand he's an
Averroist and we do know,

00:55:07.315 --> 00:55:10.570
how does Dante go about--just
saying he's here,

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:14.110
how does he go about justifying
his salvation?

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:19.016
Canto X, from this point of
view, is retrospectively one

00:55:19.016 --> 00:55:23.389
that sheds light on Canto X of
Inferno,

00:55:23.389 --> 00:55:25.277
where we also saw,
you remember,

00:55:25.277 --> 00:55:27.530
the Averroists and the
Epicureans,

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:31.693
Guido Cavalcanti,
those who believed that the

00:55:31.693 --> 00:55:35.215
mind,
that love and knowledge never

00:55:35.215 --> 00:55:41.039
interact with each other,
that the mind goes--rationality

00:55:41.039 --> 00:55:46.699
is darkened and dimmed by the
infusions of passions,

00:55:46.699 --> 00:55:50.869
remember, and that the mind is
one that receives ideas from the

00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:53.603
outside,
or that notion of both the

00:55:53.603 --> 00:55:57.592
inertia of the will and the
divisions within the mind

00:55:57.592 --> 00:55:58.360
itself.
 

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:02.559
Dante now is correcting some of
those views.

00:56:02.559 --> 00:56:04.809
So let's look a little bit at
these metaphors in Canto X.

00:56:04.809 --> 00:56:08.414
"This one from whom thy
look returns to me is the light

00:56:08.414 --> 00:56:11.992
of a spirit to whom,
in his grave thoughts,

00:56:11.992 --> 00:56:15.449
death seemed slow in
coming."

00:56:15.449 --> 00:56:20.099
He was killed,
by the way, by a madman and

00:56:20.099 --> 00:56:26.340
Dante writes a sonnet about him
in around 1281 or so.

00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.152
"It is the eternal life of
Siger," so we know that

00:56:29.152 --> 00:56:31.639
he's saved,
"who lecturing in the

00:56:31.639 --> 00:56:34.550
Street of Straw,
demonstrated invidious

00:56:34.550 --> 00:56:35.599
truths."
 

00:56:35.599 --> 00:56:39.590
Dante gives the address of this
man.

00:56:39.590 --> 00:56:43.876
He lectured,
a word that has a certain value

00:56:43.876 --> 00:56:49.262
in the university language,
a university lexicon of the

00:56:49.262 --> 00:56:50.159
time.
 

00:56:50.159 --> 00:56:54.010
Lecturing is an activity that
implies glossing,

00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:57.360
just as is the glosseta of
Aristotle,

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:02.907
but he tells us where he lived,
in the Street of Straw in

00:57:02.907 --> 00:57:05.643
Paris,
a street that now is called by

00:57:05.643 --> 00:57:07.396
the way,
the Rue de Voir,

00:57:07.396 --> 00:57:09.809
but is now called the Rue
Dante,

00:57:09.809 --> 00:57:12.956
knowing that clearly the
Parisians are mindful of this

00:57:12.956 --> 00:57:13.550
passage.
 

00:57:13.550 --> 00:57:18.699
Dante is placing Siger on the
road,

00:57:18.699 --> 00:57:23.934
on the way, he's giving us his
address but he is telling us

00:57:23.934 --> 00:57:28.989
that his thinking takes place
while he is on the road.

00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:35.842
You all know that philosophy is
always understanding itself as a

00:57:35.842 --> 00:57:39.320
journey,
a method, an exodus,

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:45.932
Parmenides, or a quietness of
things about the five ways to

00:57:45.932 --> 00:57:50.380
reach the ultimate truths about
God.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:56.715
Dante is a philosopher,
is on the way to theological

00:57:56.715 --> 00:57:59.594
certainty,
theological truth and

00:57:59.594 --> 00:58:02.965
theological knowledge and he
"demonstrated invidious

00:58:02.965 --> 00:58:03.929
truths."
 

00:58:03.929 --> 00:58:07.916
The Italian is
sillogizzò,

00:58:07.916 --> 00:58:11.597
made syllogisms out of,
demonstrated,

00:58:11.597 --> 00:58:16.199
rationally demonstrated
invidious truths.

00:58:16.199 --> 00:58:18.059
What are these invidious truths?
 

00:58:18.059 --> 00:58:21.358
Invidious truths,
I'm not sure that all the

00:58:21.358 --> 00:58:23.400
translators would agree.
 

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:26.789
Invidious truths have to be
understood etymologically.

00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:30.880
This is the canto where Isidore
of Seville is presently--

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.275
Isidore of Seville being the
arch etymologist of the Middle

00:58:35.275 --> 00:58:39.217
Ages and Dante is showing how he
too we can play with

00:58:39.217 --> 00:58:40.429
etymologies.
 

00:58:40.429 --> 00:58:43.349
Isidore of Seville is the one
who believed that whole of

00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:45.396
knowledge,
all we know,

00:58:45.396 --> 00:58:52.186
the compass of all knowledge
can really be arrived at through

00:58:52.186 --> 00:58:55.130
etymologizing language.
 

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:58.867
Language, the etymon of
language, the origin of words

00:58:58.867 --> 00:59:02.244
will give us an access to the
nature of reality,

00:59:02.244 --> 00:59:05.909
so language becomes a way of
knowing the world.

00:59:05.909 --> 00:59:09.865
Dante indulges in the same
activity calling the truth that

00:59:09.865 --> 00:59:12.295
Siger pursued
"invidious,"

00:59:12.295 --> 00:59:15.420
which etymologically means
those things,

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.739
those truths that cannot be
demonstrated,

00:59:17.739 --> 00:59:20.360
those truths that cannot be
seen.

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:25.893
Philosophy appears as an art of
speculation that takes us on the

00:59:25.893 --> 00:59:30.550
way to a truth that it cannot
quite have access to.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:34.708
What are these truths that
Siger of Brabant sought access

00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:35.079
to?
 

00:59:35.079 --> 00:59:39.818
The immortality of the soul,
there is no way he would have

00:59:39.818 --> 00:59:42.480
known or even discovered that.
 

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:46.333
Aristotle is very doubtful
about the individual immortality

00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:49.190
of the soul and the treatise of
the soul.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:55.001
He tried to consider--to
view--to decide about the origin

00:59:55.001 --> 00:59:56.559
of the world.
 

00:59:56.559 --> 01:00:01.724
Siger believed that the
universe is another one of those

01:00:01.724 --> 01:00:06.206
indemonstrable believes,
that the universe is eternal

01:00:06.206 --> 01:00:09.891
and this is an argument that saw
medieval thinkers and

01:00:09.891 --> 01:00:13.579
theologians engaged in,
Averroism on the one side and

01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:17.074
Aquinas who maintains that
philosophically you really can

01:00:17.074 --> 01:00:19.820
believe and show that the
universe is really,

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.820
is eternal.
 

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.909
But out of faith you can go on
believing in creation,

01:00:24.909 --> 01:00:27.494
that things have a beginning,
but if you don't think that

01:00:27.494 --> 01:00:30.423
things have a beginning,
then there's never a

01:00:30.423 --> 01:00:35.226
possibility of allowing for
giving some ground and rooting

01:00:35.226 --> 01:00:38.717
the idea of your freedom,
your innovations,

01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:42.351
the possibilities things can be
different from you from what

01:00:42.351 --> 01:00:44.199
they were before and so on.
 

01:00:44.199 --> 01:00:48.409
The reason why Dante rescues
Siger of Brabant is a way for

01:00:48.409 --> 01:00:52.543
him to be ultimately thinking
and making a statement that

01:00:52.543 --> 01:00:55.719
whatever we believe that is
knowledge,

01:00:55.719 --> 01:00:58.050
it's never definite and it's
always--

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:03.273
we are literally on the way and
rethinking it and making it all

01:01:03.273 --> 01:01:07.150
the time an object of our own
self-critique.

01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:10.677
This is not the only place
where Dante is rethinking

01:01:10.677 --> 01:01:11.369
himself.
 

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:14.989
Very soon around the notion of
the Trinity,

01:01:14.989 --> 01:01:18.429
Bonaventure will have to change
his mind about a man,

01:01:18.429 --> 01:01:20.320
a figure that I have mentioned
before,

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.489
Joachim Flora,
in the next canto.

01:01:22.489 --> 01:01:26.782
The idea with a Joachistic
interpretation of history,

01:01:26.782 --> 01:01:31.568
so he will--we are going to
have to have Canto XI balancing

01:01:31.568 --> 01:01:32.889
off Canto X.
 

01:01:32.889 --> 01:01:33.989
Then it ends,
the canto ends,

01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:35.695
"Then,
like a clock,"

01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:38.885
what an extraordinary image,
an image of time now,

01:01:38.885 --> 01:01:42.724
but what I have to say is that
you probably do not know that

01:01:42.724 --> 01:01:44.911
clocks,
mechanical clocks,

01:01:44.911 --> 01:01:49.978
the way we still see them were
a recent technological invention

01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:55.210
in the late thirteenth century
which Dante is absorbing here.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:58.628
"Then, like a clock that
calls us at the hour when the

01:01:58.628 --> 01:02:02.047
bride of God rises to sing
matins to the Bridegroom that he

01:02:02.047 --> 01:02:04.998
may love her,
when one part draws or drives

01:02:04.998 --> 01:02:07.594
another,
sounding the chime with notes

01:02:07.594 --> 01:02:11.420
so sweet that the well-ordered
spirit swells with love,

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:16.538
so I saw the glorious wheel
move and render voice to voice

01:02:16.538 --> 01:02:22.106
with harmony and sweetness that
cannot be known but there where

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:24.800
joy becomes eternal."
 

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.719
Dante is describing these songs
of the eternal--

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:37.309
of the blessed souls in erotic
terms,

01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:41.704
so that what seems to be a
canto of pure knowledge

01:02:41.704 --> 01:02:46.637
ultimately becomes a love song
too and this is the whole

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:48.969
trajectory of Canto X.
 

01:02:48.969 --> 01:02:54.514
Let me stop here and see if
there some questions about these

01:02:54.514 --> 01:02:58.650
three cantos which I'll be glad
to answer.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:03.275
They are a little bit abstract
but I think that they respond to

01:03:03.275 --> 01:03:07.530
genuinely interesting and
historical problems at least.

01:03:33.739 --> 01:03:38.753
The question of allegory at the
beginning--let me just give you

01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:42.070
a kind of quick resume of what
we said.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:46.411
In Canto IV you have two
issues, you have the issue of

01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:50.753
allegory and the issue of the
will where Dante goes on

01:03:50.753 --> 01:03:53.949
explaining the mode of
representation in

01:03:53.949 --> 01:03:58.538
Paradise as a mode of
accommodation to our limited

01:03:58.538 --> 01:04:02.798
faculty and he thinks that this
is really the mode of

01:04:02.798 --> 01:04:06.650
representation throughout the
Bible,

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:09.789
the iconography of the Church,
the poem,

01:04:09.789 --> 01:04:15.992
etc., which is a way therefore
of talking about allegory in a

01:04:15.992 --> 01:04:21.989
slightly different form from the
way he spoke of it in,

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:23.929
as you remember what I spoke of
it,

01:04:23.929 --> 01:04:26.730
but he was allowing us to do
that in Canto IX of

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.364
Inferno where we had been
talking about the allegory of

01:04:30.364 --> 01:04:32.449
poets, allegory of theologians.
 

01:04:32.449 --> 01:04:37.001
Now there is no question that I
think that there is no intrinsic

01:04:37.001 --> 01:04:39.530
difference between the two
modes.

01:04:39.530 --> 01:04:41.998
Remember that I used to talk
about the allegory of

01:04:41.998 --> 01:04:45.170
theologians as being an allegory
where the literal level is true

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:48.344
and the allegory of poets as one
in which the literal level is a

01:04:48.344 --> 01:04:49.050
fiction.
 

01:04:49.050 --> 01:04:53.054
Now I'm saying that both of
them for Dante have a kind of

01:04:53.054 --> 01:04:56.628
metaphorical basis and the
relationship between the

01:04:56.628 --> 01:05:00.978
metaphor and truth is,
of course, it's certainly the

01:05:00.978 --> 01:05:05.590
language of a very similitude,
if not absolutely the truth.

01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:09.306
Then the two--the other issue
about the will,

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:14.039
the limitations of the will,
the conditional and absolute

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:14.800
will.
 

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.699
When we come to Canto VI of
Paradise Dante shifts

01:05:19.699 --> 01:05:25.132
gears altogether and talks about
history, and the framework of

01:05:25.132 --> 01:05:26.469
the Empire.
 

01:05:26.469 --> 01:05:28.811
Is it providential,
I call it what is the

01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:31.885
rationality of the Empire,
but the real issue is,

01:05:31.885 --> 01:05:35.510
is there such a thing as a
providentality of the Empire,

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:39.219
which he had maintained
in--elsewhere in the poem and

01:05:39.219 --> 01:05:42.360
certainly in the text of
Monarchia.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.889
Dante concludes now,
seems to have to explain,

01:05:46.889 --> 01:05:52.072
give an apology for his belief
in the Empire by agreeing with

01:05:52.072 --> 01:05:56.005
and siding with Virgil,
but at the same time giving a

01:05:56.005 --> 01:05:59.090
critique of the Empire and
acknowledging Augustine,

01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:01.130
but manages to criticize both.
 

01:06:01.130 --> 01:06:04.818
Both Augustine and--for
different reasons and Virgil had

01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:09.280
not seen the whole truth;
Virgil can go on into unabashed

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.213
loudatio,
laudatory statements about the

01:06:13.213 --> 01:06:14.070
Empire.
 

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:19.309
Augustine can go on damning the
Empire but Augustine does not

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:24.460
understand that if within the
context of the civil war where

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.001
the realities where Corso can
turn against his sister

01:06:29.001 --> 01:06:31.873
Piccarda,
where the Guelfs can go against

01:06:31.873 --> 01:06:33.889
the Ghibellines,
where your own brother can be

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:36.110
your enemy,
that's really what it's about.

01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:39.380
Then you do need some kind of
law.

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:45.414
You read an outside world,
an outside institution that can

01:06:45.414 --> 01:06:48.909
guarantee and protect yourself.
 

01:06:48.909 --> 01:06:53.565
The claim that salvation is
only in the interiority of the

01:06:53.565 --> 01:06:56.231
soul,
which is Augustine's claim,

01:06:56.231 --> 01:06:59.659
is not really sufficient for
someone who is--

01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:03.081
as Dante was involved in the
public's fear and the public

01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:03.510
life.
 

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:06.800
I think that these are the two
most important moments.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.001
In Canto X Dante is moving
beyond the--it's a poetic break

01:07:13.001 --> 01:07:15.070
that takes place.
 

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:18.840
He literally moves us beyond
the sunlight,

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.757
the daylight of the ordinary
natural daylight moving into a

01:07:23.757 --> 01:07:28.842
world now which is his own and
Dante starts raising the issue

01:07:28.842 --> 01:07:32.219
of knowledge,
as if to say that a new

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:36.320
knowledge, a new way of thinking
now is necessary.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:40.097
Once you move beyond the
ordinary boundaries of the

01:07:40.097 --> 01:07:44.630
universe you got to have--you
start asking yourself what kind

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.050
of knowledge do I need here.
 

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:51.873
He's rethinking therefore the
whole relationship between truth

01:07:51.873 --> 01:07:55.945
or knowledge and error,
heresies and knowledge,

01:07:55.945 --> 01:08:01.380
the canonical certainties that
Aquinas would have who now makes

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:06.552
significantly enough a mistake
about the fate of Solomon and

01:08:06.552 --> 01:08:10.827
Siger of Brabant,
so that seems to be the

01:08:10.827 --> 01:08:14.949
argument that is running in
these cantos.

01:08:14.949 --> 01:08:18.542
He is forcing on us a different
way of thinking and that

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:22.591
different way of thinking begins
with a redefinition of nothing

01:08:22.591 --> 01:08:24.288
less than the Trinity.
 

01:08:24.288 --> 01:08:29.279
The idea of causality,
not the idea of efficiency,

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:32.951
causa efficiens,
that's the way God is defined

01:08:32.951 --> 01:08:36.400
by Aquinas,
that's the way that Augustine

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.502
defines--
he writes a treatise on the

01:08:39.502 --> 01:08:43.090
Trinity with the idea of God as
causality.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:46.600
Dante adds -- doesn't exclude
the others;

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.804
it would be inconceivable that
something as imponderable as the

01:08:50.804 --> 01:08:54.670
Trinity could just have one
formula to account for it,

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:59.837
but he adds onto it that first
definition of the Trinity as a

01:08:59.837 --> 01:09:04.662
unity of love and a unity of
fecundity which I think is a

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:06.729
mystical definition.
 

01:09:06.729 --> 01:09:09.840
The idea of God,
the idea of creation is one of

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:14.319
participation of the creatures,
the idea of God as being the

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:17.292
source,
the inexhaustible source of

01:09:17.292 --> 01:09:21.840
light and not just efficiency
and not just etiology,

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.127
movement, etc.,
and we shall see the

01:09:24.127 --> 01:09:25.630
implications of this.
 

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:26.850
Yes.
 

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:30.423
Student:  I was just
wondering why is it such a

01:09:30.423 --> 01:09:34.470
problem for Dante to imagine
like a perfect natural intellect

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.055
in Solomon,
because isn't it sort of

01:09:37.055 --> 01:09:39.877
Inferno and
Purgatorio sort of a

01:09:39.877 --> 01:09:43.703
perfection of the will through
Virgil's intellect and Virgil's

01:09:43.703 --> 01:09:47.192
reason,
and so why is it a dangerous

01:09:47.192 --> 01:09:53.109
proposition to say that a man
could have a perfect intellect?

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:57.130
Prof: The question,
a very good question,

01:09:57.130 --> 01:10:01.425
is why does Dante find it so
difficult to acknowledge the

01:10:01.425 --> 01:10:04.340
perfection of Solomon's
intellect,

01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:06.713
when after all,
in Inferno and

01:10:06.713 --> 01:10:10.324
Purgatorio,
we have had some accounts of

01:10:10.324 --> 01:10:14.935
how the will is moved by the
intellect and perfected by the

01:10:14.935 --> 01:10:15.970
intellect.
 

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:19.502
Am I paraphrasing
your--actually repeating what

01:10:19.502 --> 01:10:22.189
you said I think,
but accurately?

01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:25.146
It's a very good question;
it's really a complicated

01:10:25.146 --> 01:10:25.590
problem.
 

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:31.689
In fact, I think that what you
have to keep in mind how Dante

01:10:31.689 --> 01:10:37.689
talks about Solomon as a people
on Earth are so anxious--

01:10:37.689 --> 01:10:40.050
this was one of the most
incredibly debated--

01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:42.270
is he saved?
 

01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.390
Is Solomon saved?
 

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:46.747
Because he's the wisest,
that's what the Bible tells us,

01:10:46.747 --> 01:10:49.493
he's the wisest,
and we believe the Bible--the

01:10:49.493 --> 01:10:51.020
Middle Ages argument.
 

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:54.118
We believe in the Bible so he's
the wisest,

01:10:54.118 --> 01:10:59.800
but he was also known as being
the most lecherous of kings,

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:05.180
so big solution for Dante,
forget about that,

01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.448
he's really the wisest so he's
saved,

01:11:09.448 --> 01:11:13.130
so that solves that particular
issue of the relationship

01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:17.144
between love and knowledge and I
think that's a crucial point

01:11:17.144 --> 01:11:19.293
in--
for the way you are stating the

01:11:19.293 --> 01:11:22.108
issue because you are stating
how in Inferno and

01:11:22.108 --> 01:11:25.337
Purgatorio you have the
will directed and reorganized by

01:11:25.337 --> 01:11:28.350
the intellect,
so you see there must be some

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:31.680
kind of relationship between
will and intellect.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:36.248
Dante here says,
the will was really was a

01:11:36.248 --> 01:11:38.604
little bit--
was chaotic,

01:11:38.604 --> 01:11:41.980
was disordered will,
so we have only to judge him in

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:45.158
terms of this majestic intellect
that he has.

01:11:45.158 --> 01:11:49.537
In fact, he was the most
perfect of figures since Adam

01:11:49.537 --> 01:11:51.850
was created in the Garden.
 

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:54.630
That's the first thing.
 

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:57.899
But now let me come to the crux
of the matter here.

01:11:57.899 --> 01:12:04.109
If you believe that he had
intellect which was absolutely

01:12:04.109 --> 01:12:06.537
perfect,
perfect intellect,

01:12:06.537 --> 01:12:10.298
then what you're really saying
and this is the context of

01:12:10.298 --> 01:12:13.640
knowledge,
a mathesis as the

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.940
Greek's call it,
the mathesis,

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:20.020
the word mathematics it comes
from that.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:24.998
If you believe that then you're
really saying that philosophy is

01:12:24.998 --> 01:12:27.449
the way to come to the truth.
 

01:12:27.449 --> 01:12:29.618
You see what I'm saying?
 

01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:32.380
If philosophy is the way to
come to the truth,

01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:36.542
you don't really need theology
or you really have to start

01:12:36.542 --> 01:12:40.557
thinking of theology as some
kind of vulgar poet or some

01:12:40.557 --> 01:12:46.143
vulgar philosophizing,
as some kind of the poetry for

01:12:46.143 --> 01:12:49.175
the masses,
for instance,

01:12:49.175 --> 01:12:53.010
a kind of elitarian,
elite-like,

01:12:53.010 --> 01:12:59.149
view that keeps creeping up
into--in the ways of thinking

01:12:59.149 --> 01:13:05.399
about theology and philosophy
and if you believe that,

01:13:05.399 --> 01:13:06.649
that philosophy is the mode.
 

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:09.725
In fact, now we have a
correction of the philosophers

01:13:09.725 --> 01:13:12.920
immediately after with the
presence of Siger because of

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.753
course--
see the ambivalence Siger is

01:13:15.753 --> 01:13:20.229
justified and saved because his
mind was a searching mind.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:22.965
He's on the road,
he's a true philosopher

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.470
he--it's the method.
 

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:28.162
I was describing logic as a
method that the Greek word that

01:13:28.162 --> 01:13:29.689
means "way."
 

01:13:29.689 --> 01:13:34.448
It's the root,
the philosopher of the root,

01:13:34.448 --> 01:13:36.840
philosophy is on the way out of
their odyssey,

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.710
the odyssey of the soul,
that's really--

01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:44.228
we call it--Dante says exodus,
it's an exodus clearly

01:13:44.228 --> 01:13:48.399
countering the idea of the
philosophical root.

01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:51.474
There's another story,
another way of looking at

01:13:51.474 --> 01:13:53.689
journeys,
he's certainly involved in a

01:13:53.689 --> 01:13:55.615
journey,
a journey of the heart and a

01:13:55.615 --> 01:13:57.538
journey of the mind at the same
time.

01:13:57.538 --> 01:14:01.565
Once you go on,
Siger is on--there is--there

01:14:01.565 --> 01:14:03.439
was no perfection.
 

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:08.251
He tried to demonstrate and
look at the paradox invidious,

01:14:08.251 --> 01:14:12.050
that is to say,
truths that cannot be seen.

01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:14.578
I appear to the etymology of
invidious.

01:14:14.578 --> 01:14:19.368
Many translations and they say
unwelcome truths.

01:14:19.368 --> 01:14:21.000
I don't know what kind of
translations,

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.452
actually I like my Sinclair who
says "invidious

01:14:24.452 --> 01:14:27.363
truths,"
but many others translate that

01:14:27.363 --> 01:14:31.220
word invidious as unwelcome or
the truths that made him be

01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:34.605
scorned and hated by others
because the jealousy of

01:14:34.605 --> 01:14:38.328
philosophers is a little bit in
the background.

01:14:38.328 --> 01:14:41.310
He lost his life,
he was killed because of that,

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:49.141
but instead he is in pursuit of
truths which is the aim of

01:14:49.141 --> 01:14:54.090
philosophy of all
investigations,

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:56.829
but philosophical
investigations,

01:14:56.829 --> 01:15:01.876
but cannot be demonstrated,
that cannot be seen so there is

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:05.791
a limitation of the
philosophical road of the road

01:15:05.791 --> 01:15:07.149
of philosophy.
 

01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:12.414
Indirectly, the limitation of
Solomon's perfect claim of--he

01:15:12.414 --> 01:15:16.698
never claimed that he had a
perfect intellect.

01:15:16.698 --> 01:15:19.750
In fact, Aquinas who realizes
what he has said,

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:24.235
he says no, no,
no the wisdom of Solomon has to

01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:30.087
be viewed in his prudence for
asking God that he be given the

01:15:30.087 --> 01:15:35.550
absolute knowledge in the
government of his people,

01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:38.560
so it's a limited form of
knowledge but that was perfect.

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:46.199
It's--maybe it strikes you as
sophistry but I enjoy that.

01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:47.810
Thank you so much.

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.093
Prof: Okay,
at the end last time we were

00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:07.464
looking at how you could
possibly know the heat of

00:00:07.464 --> 00:00:11.418
atomization of graphite;
how much energy it takes to put

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:14.560
a carbon atom into the gas phase
from graphite.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.059
Why would you want to know that?
 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.820
Why is that a key value?
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.690
For what purpose?
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.432
If you want to be able to know
whether you can add together

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:31.590
bonds and get the energy of a
molecule,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.378
that means you start with
separated atoms and you then see

00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:39.365
how much energy is given off
when those come together to give

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:43.697
a particular molecule,
to make a whole bunch of bonds.

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:44.270
Right?
 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.199
Now you can measure the energy
of a molecule with respect to

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.210
CO_2 quite easily.
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.370
How do you do that?
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.060
Burn it.
 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.580
And you can measure the CO_2
relative to graphite.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.070
How do you do that?
 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.391
How do you know the energy of a
carbon in -- or the energy of

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:08.280
CO_2 relative to the energy of
graphite plus oxygen?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.450
You burn graphite. Okay?
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.890
But the last thing you need is
the energy of graphite relative

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.680
to the atom.
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.442
And if you then knew that,
then you could complete this

00:01:21.442 --> 00:01:24.373
scheme and know,
just by burning things,

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:27.592
whether you can add together
bond energies to get the energy

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:28.519
of a molecule.
 

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:32.910
Okay, so how do you get the
energy from graphite to an atom?

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.646
One way is spectroscopy,
and we talked about that last

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:38.337
time,
that if you see what the

00:01:38.337 --> 00:01:44.316
minimum amount of energy you can
put into CO_2 and have it break

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:47.650
into two atoms,
that gives you the energy of

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.510
the two atoms relative to CO_2
--

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.563
pardon me, relative to CO I
should be saying.

00:01:52.563 --> 00:01:53.120
Right?
 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.096
And then you burn CO and get it
relative to CO_2,

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.391
and then you have everything
you need.

00:01:58.391 --> 00:01:58.950
Okay?
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.108
Okay, except that people who
were very smart,

00:02:04.108 --> 00:02:08.430
Nobel Prize winners and so on,
differed on interpreting this,

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.639
because some of them thought
that when you break into atoms,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.837
with the light,
the atom you get is not the

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:18.319
lowest energy state of the atom,
but a higher energy state of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.908
the atom.
 

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:23.230
So some of the energy you're
putting in is going into making

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.550
an excited atom.
 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.055
And the true energy of forming
the minimum-energy carbon atom

00:02:29.055 --> 00:02:33.560
from graphite is lower than what
you do spectroscopically.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.378
So the spectroscopic value is
very precise.

00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:38.883
You can measure the position,
the color of the light,

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:39.750
very accurately.
 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.626
But they didn't know what it
corresponded to,

00:02:42.626 --> 00:02:46.549
so they needed a different way
to know what the energy of the

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.229
carbon atom was relative to
graphite.

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.163
Now Professor Sharpless said --
you know, he talked about

00:02:54.163 --> 00:02:58.073
increasing dimension of carbon;
start with an atom,

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:00.186
go to a line,
polyacetylene and then to a

00:03:00.186 --> 00:03:03.430
bunch of double bonds,
and finally to a saturated

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.254
hydrocarbon --
he said that carbon atoms are

00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:07.580
very hard to come by.
 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.854
You need a really,
really low vacuum to get it.

00:03:09.854 --> 00:03:10.250
Right?
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.408
That is, the equilibrium
constant for carbon atoms coming

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:17.827
together to form bonds is very,
very favorable.

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:18.569
Right?
 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.758
So it's hard to get atoms.
 

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:22.699
So how are you ever going to
get atoms?

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.590
Well let's think about that
problem here.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.208
So we know that the equilibrium
constant at room temperature is

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.220
10^-(3/4)ΔE.
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.759
So you can measure k.
 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.470
Then you know ΔE.
 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.315
So, but if the equilibrium
you're trying to measure is

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:42.000
between graphite and carbon
atoms,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.758
and the energy to take a carbon
atom out of graphite is 170

00:03:46.758 --> 00:03:51.650
kilocalories/mol,
then the equilibrium constant

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.883
is 10^-127.
 

00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:53.780
Right?
 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.988
And that means,
since there are only something

00:03:56.988 --> 00:04:00.340
of the order of 10^80 atoms in
the universe,

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.060
there would not be,
at room temperature,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.873
a single carbon atom at
equilibrium with graphite if

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:09.792
everything in the universe was
graphite.

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:10.538
Right?
 

00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:13.620
So it's not a very favorable
equilibrium constant.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.920
What could you do about it,
if you wanted to measure the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.980
equilibrium constant,
and in that way get the energy

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.879
difference?
 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:22.899
Any knobs you can twist?
 

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:24.920
Lucas?
 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.629
Student:  Temperature.
 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.920
Prof: You could increase
the temperature.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.310
Right?
 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.319
Because it's ΔE/kT.
 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.437
And remember,
we're talking about room

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:34.240
temperature.
 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.738
So if we're much higher than
room temperature,

00:04:36.738 --> 00:04:38.850
then the exponent gets much
smaller.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.103
So suppose we went to ten times
room temperature,

00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:44.432
to 3000 Kelvin.
 

00:04:44.432 --> 00:04:45.230
Right?
 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.339
Then it would be,
instead of 3/4ths,

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:50.293
it would be 3/40ths,
because the denominator would

00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:51.740
be ten times bigger.
 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.360
And now it would be 1 in
10^13th would be an atom.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.115
And now that's a substantial
number, if you're talking about

00:04:59.115 --> 00:05:00.050
Avogadro's number.
 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.874
So if you had something really,
really sensitive,

00:05:02.874 --> 00:05:05.523
to measure atoms,
you might be able to measure

00:05:05.523 --> 00:05:07.230
the atoms at equilibrium.
 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.786
But you have to establish
equilibrium at something of the

00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:13.201
order of 3000°,
or at least really,

00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:13.901
really hot.
 

00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:14.600
Right?
 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.444
So you could write the
equilibrium constant,

00:05:17.444 --> 00:05:21.480
the concentration of atoms over
the concentration of graphite,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.540
in this way.
 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.745
That has to do -- that is the
heat of formation,

00:05:25.745 --> 00:05:27.586
atoms relative to graphite.
 

00:05:27.586 --> 00:05:28.199
Right?
 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.975
Now, of course,
exactly what one means by the

00:05:30.975 --> 00:05:34.947
concentration of graphite needs
to be -- you scratch your head a

00:05:34.947 --> 00:05:36.336
little bit about that.
 

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:37.029
Right?
 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:38.860
But you don't actually need to
know it,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.766
because if you could measure
the pressure of the C atoms at

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:46.355
equilibrium with graphite,
at very high temperature --

00:05:46.355 --> 00:05:48.839
call that the pressure of
carbon, right?

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.170
-- that is some constant,
and that constant will include

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.319
whatever this concentration of
graphite should be.

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.887
So B. So multiply both sides
by that concentration of

00:05:58.887 --> 00:05:59.504
graphite.
 

00:05:59.504 --> 00:06:00.259
Right?
 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.862
So we get some constant on the
right, and then that heat of

00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:07.028
formation, in the exponent,
that we want to find.

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:10.423
So that means we could write --
if we took the log of both

00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:10.899
sides.
 

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:13.949
You have the log of the
pressure of carbon atoms,

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:17.699
is the log of whatever B is --
that's some constant -- minus

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:18.970
this other term.
 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.209
And what that means is that if
you --

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:25.699
that that minus the heat of
formation of the carbon atom,

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.434
divided by R,
is the slope of a plot of the

00:06:30.434 --> 00:06:34.899
pressure of carbon atoms,
versus 1/T.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:36.740
Does everyone see that?
 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.257
In that equation,
that equation says that there's

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:43.439
an intercept,
which is the log of b,

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.079
and a slope,
which is -ΔH

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.500
formation to carbon,
divided by R,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.019
if you plot against 1/T.
 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:51.930
Everybody with me on that?
 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.110
Nod if you see it.
 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.029
Okay.
 

00:06:56.029 --> 00:07:00.480
So all you need to do is plot
the log of the pressure of

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.394
carbon atoms,
which will be very low,

00:07:03.394 --> 00:07:07.036
versus 1/T,
at very high temperature --

00:07:07.036 --> 00:07:09.649
right?;
of the order of 3000 Kelvin.

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:13.879
So that's not easy to do.
 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:19.250
But it was done in 1955 by
Chupka and Inghram.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.641
And this is the sketch of their
instrument, and I'll show you

00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:26.259
how they did it.
 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:29.774
First there's a graphite
cylinder.

00:07:29.774 --> 00:07:30.519
Okay?
 

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:35.259
And around it is a can made out
of tantalum.

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:36.810
Now why tantalum?
 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.420
Because that's about the
highest melting thing you can

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.949
get;
it's the highest melting metal.

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:47.069
So 3293 Kelvin is its melting
point.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:50.964
So you could really heat the
heck out of this thing.

00:07:50.964 --> 00:07:51.500
Okay?
 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.553
And now you surround that with
wires, and those wires are made

00:07:55.553 --> 00:07:59.009
of tungsten, because that's very
high melting too.

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:03.555
And so you connect wire -- you
connect electricity to the

00:08:03.555 --> 00:08:06.560
tungsten, and also to the
tantalum.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:10.634
So electrons boil off the
tungsten and bombard the

00:08:10.634 --> 00:08:15.540
tantalum, and when the electrons
hit it, they heat it up.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.387
So you can heat the heck out of
this tantalum can by bombarding

00:08:19.387 --> 00:08:20.629
it with electrons.
 

00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:24.137
And that, of course,
heats the graphite that's

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:24.839
inside.
 

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:29.521
Now, so inside there's going to
be a gas of carbon,

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.799
in equilibrium with the
graphite.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.740
Now it won't just be C atoms.
 

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.264
It'll also be C_2,
C_3, C_60, C_70,

00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:41.591
and so on;
but lots of different forms of

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:42.840
carbon, as a gas.
 

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.590
So you can't just measure the
pressure in there;

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:48.160
and indeed it would be tough to
measure the pressure inside,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.070
at 3000°.
 

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.399
But you at least have these
things there at equilibrium.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.322
Now what they did,
Chupka and Inghram,

00:08:56.322 --> 00:09:00.509
was to drill a tiny hole,
in the top of this thing.

00:09:00.509 --> 00:09:04.360
And that will allow a little
bit of the gas to escape;

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.148
not so much that you destroy
the equilibrium inside,

00:09:08.148 --> 00:09:09.931
just a really slow leak.
 

00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.600
Right?
 

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.711
So now, if you could measure
the amount of these different

00:09:14.711 --> 00:09:18.320
carbon species leaking out,
you could know what the

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.846
pressure of them was inside the
can.

00:09:20.846 --> 00:09:21.639
Okay?
 

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:26.008
Now, so there's a beam of
carbon species coming out,

00:09:26.008 --> 00:09:28.149
gaseous carbon species.
 

00:09:28.149 --> 00:09:30.418
This is all at very,
very high vacuum.

00:09:30.418 --> 00:09:30.908
Right?
 

00:09:30.908 --> 00:09:34.032
And then up there,
an electron beam comes across

00:09:34.032 --> 00:09:37.751
and hits these carbon things,
and knocks electrons out of

00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:38.350
them.
 

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:47.730
And that converts them into C+;
C_1, C_2, C_3, C_60+. Okay?

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.750
So you have a beam coming out
of these charged carbon species.

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:54.000
Now why do you want them to be
charged?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.240
For two reasons.
 

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.644
One, so you can detect them;
because you can detect it when

00:09:59.644 --> 00:10:00.980
charge hits a plate.
 

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:05.672
And the other one is so you can
deflect the beams with a

00:10:05.672 --> 00:10:06.951
magnetic field.
 

00:10:06.951 --> 00:10:07.720
Right?
 

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.337
So these various carbon species
come out, and they go into a

00:10:11.337 --> 00:10:14.035
magnetic field,
which puts a lateral force on

00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:16.058
them and causes them to bend.
 

00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:18.594
And, of course,
the lighter they are,

00:10:18.594 --> 00:10:23.028
the easier they are to bend if
they all have the same charge.

00:10:23.028 --> 00:10:26.220
So you're going to get curved
trajectories.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.308
C_3+, C_2+, C_1+ will be the
most bent.

00:10:30.308 --> 00:10:34.553
And now if you put a detector
at these different positions,

00:10:34.553 --> 00:10:37.335
you can see how much C_1,
how much C_2,

00:10:37.335 --> 00:10:39.018
how much C_3 there was.
 

00:10:39.018 --> 00:10:39.750
Okay?
 

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.509
So that's how you're going to
do it.

00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:43.578
But this machine has to be
pretty special,

00:10:43.578 --> 00:10:45.245
because you're heating it so
high.

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:45.750
Lucas?
 

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.125
Student:  How do you
know the electron beam only

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:47.788
knocks off one electron?
 

00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:50.317
Prof: It can knock off
two, but then you get it at a

00:10:50.317 --> 00:10:51.450
very different position.
 

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.509
You can tell these things.
 

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:56.428
This thing is called mass
spectroscopy.

00:10:56.428 --> 00:10:59.716
But it knocks off one much more
often than it knocks off two or

00:10:59.716 --> 00:11:00.139
three.
 

00:11:00.139 --> 00:11:03.880
Student:  And isn't this
kind of the same problem as we

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.009
had with the other thing,
where the C is ionized?

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:09.100
Prof: Which other thing?
 

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.620
I can't remember what problem
--

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:13.869
Student:  You said that
we couldn't measure the other

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:17.230
one because it was a high energy
state, spectrographically.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.105
Prof: Oh.
 

00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:19.750
Might it be an excited state?
 

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.950
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.549
Prof: No because it's in
equilibrium.

00:11:21.549 --> 00:11:22.668
Student:  Okay.
 

00:11:22.668 --> 00:11:24.817
Prof: The excited state
would be much,

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:27.500
much less at equilibrium,
because it's higher in energy.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:27.990
Right?
 

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.273
That's a good point though;
good that you thought about

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:30.570
that.
 

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.267
Now, so you have to put
shielding around this stuff,

00:11:33.267 --> 00:11:34.960
so it doesn't melt everything.
 

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.643
So you use tantalum,
which is high melting,

00:11:38.643 --> 00:11:41.448
and a series of
can-inside-a-can,

00:11:41.448 --> 00:11:43.115
like Russian dolls.
 

00:11:43.115 --> 00:11:44.080
Right?
 

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.308
So the inside most one is very,
very hot;

00:11:47.308 --> 00:11:49.529
then a little less hot,
a little less hot.

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:49.909
Okay?
 

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:50.918
So you shield it.
 

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:54.120
And now you need to know the
temperature inside.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.698
And you do it by drilling a
tiny hole through those shields

00:11:57.698 --> 00:12:00.970
so you can have what's called an
optical pyrometer.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.485
That's just something that
looks at the color of something

00:12:03.485 --> 00:12:04.370
that's really hot.
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.417
And something that's hot gives
-- even something that's cold --

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:09.038
gives off black-body radiation.
 

00:12:09.038 --> 00:12:13.168
And the color has to do with
the temperature;

00:12:13.168 --> 00:12:16.068
you know, there's red heat,
white heat, blue heat,

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:16.778
and so on.
 

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.552
So by measuring the color,
you can see what the

00:12:19.552 --> 00:12:21.058
temperature was inside.
 

00:12:21.058 --> 00:12:23.734
And that window,
that the light comes through,

00:12:23.734 --> 00:12:26.350
has to be made of quartz,
not Pyrex glass.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.230
You know why?
 

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.870
Student:  Pyrex would
melt.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.397
Prof: Because Pyrex
glass would melt,

00:12:31.397 --> 00:12:32.690
even at that distance.
 

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.220
Right?
 

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.059
So you use quartz glass.
 

00:12:36.059 --> 00:12:38.019
Okay, so that's what you do.
 

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:41.625
And here's a graph of the
pressure of these various

00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.418
species,
measured with that mass

00:12:43.418 --> 00:12:45.682
spectrometer,
at different temperatures,

00:12:45.682 --> 00:12:48.100
measured as one over
temperature here.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.446
So it goes from 2150 Kelvin to
2450 Kelvin, and the pressure

00:12:52.446 --> 00:12:53.330
increases.
 

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:57.250
And it's plotted as the log of
the intensity of the signal;

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.783
that is, the pressure times
temperature, because the

00:12:59.783 --> 00:13:02.120
pressure has to be corrected for
temperature.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.812
Because if you have the same
number of things giving the

00:13:04.812 --> 00:13:07.650
pressure, but they're hotter,
they'll be pressing harder on

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.190
things.
 

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.998
It's the intensity of the
signal times the temperature

00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:13.580
that you plot there.
 

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.083
And from the slope,
you can see up there at the

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:20.970
top, that for C_1 you get -- the
slope says it's 171

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.940
kilocalories/mol;
Q.E.D.***Right?

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:26.966
Now you know which was the
right one, measured by

00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:27.600
spectroscopy.
 

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.918
It was the one that said 171.
 

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:32.625
So this experiment,
actually measuring the

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:35.860
equilibrium between carbon atoms
and graphite,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.440
by a really gargantuan kind of
experiment,

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.178
is what settled the question
finally.

00:13:42.178 --> 00:13:45.259
So that when you look at the
appendix of this book,

00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:46.658
Streitwieser,
Heathcock and Kosower,

00:13:46.658 --> 00:13:49.606
you find that there are heats
of formation for atoms and

00:13:49.606 --> 00:13:51.960
radicals,
measured by spectroscopy and

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.059
things like this.
 

00:13:53.059 --> 00:13:56.389
And there you see carbon, 170.9.
 

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:58.758
And that was done by Professor
Chupka, who was in this

00:13:58.758 --> 00:14:01.528
department and who used to come
and tell people how he did this

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:02.200
experiment.
 

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.000
But as you can see,
he passed away in 2007.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.820
So thanks to Professor Chupka.
 

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.091
And the nice thing is,
once that's done,

00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:11.100
it's done.
 

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.085
Now you know it and you just
plug it in when you burn your

00:14:14.085 --> 00:14:16.389
stuff and want to know what its
energy is.

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:19.528
You can get it relative to
carbon atoms in the gas phase.

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:23.049
Okay, now how good are these
spectroscopic experiments?

00:14:23.049 --> 00:14:24.408
Well this is a neat thing.
 

00:14:24.408 --> 00:14:28.298
The heat of atomization of
methane, measured in the ways

00:14:28.298 --> 00:14:32.470
we've just been talking about,
is 397.5 kilocalories/mol.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:37.426
Now that comes from mating a
carbon atom with four hydrogen

00:14:37.426 --> 00:14:41.110
atoms;
that is 397.5. Right?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.710
So we know what the average
bond energy.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.980
There are four such bonds.
 

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:48.330
So each one's worth 99.4
kilocalories/mol.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.570
So about 100 kilocalories/mol
for a C-H bond;

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.628
that's convenient to remember.
 

00:14:53.628 --> 00:14:54.038
Okay?
 

00:14:54.038 --> 00:14:58.640
But that's not how much it
costs to take a single hydrogen

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.658
atom away from methane.
 

00:15:00.658 --> 00:15:04.389
Taking a single hydrogen atom
away from methane,

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:07.240
the so-called "bond
dissociation energy",

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.183
which is the actual
experimental energy it takes to

00:15:10.183 --> 00:15:14.042
do some particular process --
average bond energy is just an

00:15:14.042 --> 00:15:16.384
average,
but the individual ones are not

00:15:16.384 --> 00:15:19.442
the same --
taking a hydrogen away from

00:15:19.442 --> 00:15:22.908
methane is 104.99,
plus or minus 0.03

00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:24.590
kilocalories/mol.
 

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.269
Close, but not the same thing.
 

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:28.570
And then you have CH_3.
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.389
If you take a second H off
that, it's 110.4.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:34.841
The next one is 101.3,
and the final one,

00:15:34.841 --> 00:15:37.775
taking H away from C,
is only 80.9.

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:38.639
Right?
 

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.440
Now these are done by
spectroscopy.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.820
And Barney Ellison may come and
talk to us in the spring;

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.714
he's often traveling through
and talks about how he measured

00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.450
these things.
 

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.240
But those are done by
spectroscopy.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.134
But the neat thing about it is
if you add all those four

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:57.818
numbers together -- so,
pardon me, I was going to say

00:15:57.818 --> 00:16:00.440
no individual bond equals the
average.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.288
Right?
 

00:16:01.288 --> 00:16:04.700
But if you add them together
you get 397.5,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.379
which is precisely the average.
 

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:09.288
So these are very good
experiments.

00:16:09.288 --> 00:16:14.524
So we know, through heroic
spectroscopy and this work of

00:16:14.524 --> 00:16:18.307
Chupka and Inghram,
we know what these energies

00:16:18.307 --> 00:16:23.558
are, bond energies,
and bond dissociation energies.

00:16:23.558 --> 00:16:26.474
So here are average bond
energies in a table that you

00:16:26.474 --> 00:16:29.220
have at the end of this organic
chemistry text.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:31.918
And it says a carbon-hydrogen
bond is 99;

00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:33.450
and now you see where we get
that.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:38.389
And you see that a
carbon-carbon bond is 83.

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:42.721
But the second carbon-carbon
bond, in a double bond,

00:16:42.721 --> 00:16:43.654
is only 63.
 

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:44.419
Right?
 

00:16:44.419 --> 00:16:45.240
Why is it weaker?
 

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:52.273
Why is the second bond of a
carbon-carbon double bond weaker

00:16:52.273 --> 00:16:54.299
than the first?
 

00:16:54.299 --> 00:16:56.519
Pardon me?
 

00:16:56.519 --> 00:17:00.080
Devin, what do you say?
 

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.269
Student:  The overlap.
 

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:03.594
Prof: Yeah,
you have bad overlap between

00:17:03.594 --> 00:17:05.009
the π electrons.
 

00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:08.334
In fact, the first,
the single bond of a double

00:17:08.334 --> 00:17:12.308
bond, is probably stronger than
a normal single bond.

00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:14.380
Can anybody see why that would
be?

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:17.278
Student:  More s
character.

00:17:17.278 --> 00:17:18.839
Prof: It's got more
s character,

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.308
better overlap;
sp^2-sp^2.

00:17:21.308 --> 00:17:25.292
So the second one is probably
more than 20 kilocalories weaker

00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:26.730
than the single one.
 

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:30.631
But at any rate it's 146,
that you add up to get a double

00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:35.310
bond, and 200 for a triple bond;
which means the third bond is

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:37.781
worth only 54 kilocalories/mol.
 

00:17:37.781 --> 00:17:38.338
Okay?
 

00:17:38.338 --> 00:17:44.950
And in C=O, it's about the same
as C-C.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.269
So C-O is eighty-six.
 

00:17:47.269 --> 00:17:50.192
But the double bond,
notice, is different in this

00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:50.618
case.
 

00:17:50.618 --> 00:17:53.598
Now the second bond is stronger
than the first.

00:17:53.598 --> 00:18:00.986
So the carbonyl group is an
especially stable group.

00:18:00.986 --> 00:18:02.000
Okay?
 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.259
So you have the question,
can you sum up these average

00:18:05.259 --> 00:18:08.460
bond energies and get useful
heats of atomization?

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.596
So can you look at a structure
and say how stable it's going to

00:18:11.596 --> 00:18:11.849
be?
 

00:18:11.849 --> 00:18:14.440
Okay, so let's try it.
 

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.131
So here's heats of atomization
by additivity of average bond

00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:18.818
energies.
 

00:18:18.818 --> 00:18:21.859
So we have these average bond
energies from the table.

00:18:21.859 --> 00:18:23.549
A C-C single-bond is 83.
 

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:25.190
A C-H is 99.
 

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.980
C double bond C is 146,86,
111 and so on.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.260
And we're going to sum them all
up to get the heat of

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.068
atomization -- compare it with
the actual heat of atomization.

00:18:34.068 --> 00:18:38.413
Okay, so for ethene,
there are four C-H bonds,

00:18:38.413 --> 00:18:41.309
there's one C-C double bond.
 

00:18:41.309 --> 00:18:43.509
Add them up, and you get 542.
 

00:18:43.509 --> 00:18:47.548
The actual heat of atomization
is 537.7.

00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:50.284
So there's an error of 4.3
kilocalories/mol,

00:18:50.284 --> 00:18:51.809
which is less than 1%.
 

00:18:51.809 --> 00:18:53.670
That's pretty good.
 

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.606
But on the other hand,
ethene probably entered in to

00:18:57.606 --> 00:19:00.616
determining these average bond
energies.

00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:01.390
Right?
 

00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.210
So it's not 100% fair. Okay?
 

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:05.410
How about cyclohexane?
 

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.259
Now we have 6 carbon-carbon
single bonds and 12

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:13.528
carbon-hydrogen single bonds:
1686 versus 1680.1.

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:16.778
An error of only 5.9,
less than half a percent error.

00:19:16.778 --> 00:19:19.269
So pretty good,
by adding up bonds.

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:20.440
Cyclohexanol.
 

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.097
Remember we had quite a bit of
trouble with these partly

00:19:23.097 --> 00:19:25.660
oxidized things before,
when we were trying to just do

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.400
it on the basis of the elements.
 

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:31.366
But if you add bonds together,
you get within 0.3% of the

00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:32.358
right value.
 

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:37.035
Or if you do glucose,
which has lots of oxygens in

00:19:37.035 --> 00:19:41.329
it, then you get within again
less then 1%;

00:19:41.329 --> 00:19:43.210
0.7% of the right value.
 

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.708
So this is pretty darn good;
very impressive,

00:19:46.708 --> 00:19:48.880
very small errors,
to predict these.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.890
But the question is,
is it useful?

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:53.808
How accurate does it have to
be, to be useful?

00:19:53.808 --> 00:19:56.680
So why do you need to know the
values?

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.720
Because you want to know
equilibrium constants.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.854
You want to know which
direction a reaction will go,

00:20:00.854 --> 00:20:01.440
for example.
 

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.166
Okay, so we know that the -- if
we want to calculate an

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:07.997
equilibrium constant,
we can do it at room

00:20:07.997 --> 00:20:10.690
temperature with this 3/4ths
trick.

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:13.948
So the calculated equilibrium
constant is whatever we're

00:20:13.948 --> 00:20:16.970
calculating here,
for energy, between two things.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.778
We have two things:
calculate the energy of these,

00:20:18.778 --> 00:20:21.430
the energy of these,
compare the energies,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.079
and that'll give us the
equilibrium constant,

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.170
according to this formula.
 

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.430
But notice I'm doing it on the
basis of calculation.

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:31.648
Now so that's -- whatever --
the calculated energy is

00:20:31.648 --> 00:20:34.568
whatever the true energy would
be.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:38.228
But there's also some error in
there.

00:20:38.228 --> 00:20:38.940
Okay?
 

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.909
But if you add two exponents,
that's the same as multiplying

00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:44.390
two things together.
 

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:47.991
So the calculated equilibrium
constant is the true equilibrium

00:20:47.991 --> 00:20:49.782
constant --
that's the first part,

00:20:49.782 --> 00:20:52.108
the part that it has with
ΔH true --

00:20:52.108 --> 00:20:55.218
times the part that has this
exponent.

00:20:55.218 --> 00:20:55.890
Right?
 

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.490
3/4ths of the ΔH
error.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:03.138
So if you want the error to be
small, that factor to be small,

00:21:03.138 --> 00:21:06.568
then ΔH error has
to be small;

00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:12.420
small, not on a percentage
basis, but absolutely it has to

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.548
be small.
 

00:21:13.548 --> 00:21:19.044
That error, not the percentage
error, determines this error

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:19.707
factor.
 

00:21:19.707 --> 00:21:20.558
Right?
 

00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:23.650
So to keep the error less than
a factor of ten,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:27.099
in the equilibrium constant,
you need to know the

00:21:27.099 --> 00:21:30.910
equilibrium constants within 1.3
kilocalories/mol,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:34.348
so that 3/4ths of it will be
one, and that would mean you'd

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:36.009
be within a factor of ten.
 

00:21:36.009 --> 00:21:37.308
Everybody with me on this?
 

00:21:37.308 --> 00:21:40.759
So you need to do even better
than this.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:44.011
You can't use the average bond
energies and get something

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:46.788
that's very useful,
because if you're off by

00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:49.390
sixteen down here,
in the case of sugar,

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.055
that means you're off by a
factor of 10^12th in predicting

00:21:53.055 --> 00:21:57.401
the equilibrium constant,
which wouldn't be acceptable

00:21:57.401 --> 00:21:58.199
probably.
 

00:21:58.199 --> 00:21:58.818
Okay?
 

00:21:58.818 --> 00:22:04.836
So let's try it with the
equilibrium between a ketone and

00:22:04.836 --> 00:22:08.750
the so-called enol,
which is an isomer of a ketone

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:11.749
in which a hydrogen has been
taken from the methyl group on

00:22:11.749 --> 00:22:15.838
the right and put on the oxygen,
and the double bond moved. Okay?

00:22:15.838 --> 00:22:19.526
So that's a very important
equilibrium that we'll encounter

00:22:19.526 --> 00:22:22.450
when we talk about the chemistry
of ketones.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:26.501
Let's see what the equilibrium
constant -- should there be more

00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.940
ketone or more enol?
 

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.140
Do you have a guess right at
the outset of which one would be

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.118
more stable?
 

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:38.913
I would guess the ketone,
because of what I just told

00:22:38.913 --> 00:22:44.484
you, that the C-O double bond is
remarkably stable.

00:22:44.484 --> 00:22:45.598
Right?
 

00:22:45.598 --> 00:22:47.700
In the other case you have a
C-C double bond.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:48.798
Okay, let's see.
 

00:22:48.798 --> 00:22:52.318
Now we could add together all
the bonds.

00:22:52.318 --> 00:22:55.365
But most of them,
most bonds are the same between

00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:57.650
the starting material and
product.

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.816
We only need to compare the
ones that change.

00:23:00.816 --> 00:23:01.318
Okay?
 

00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:04.788
So we've highlighted in red the
bonds that change between the

00:23:04.788 --> 00:23:06.491
two forms,
the two isomers,

00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:10.006
because we're interested in the
difference in energy between

00:23:10.006 --> 00:23:13.000
these two,
to get the equilibrium constant.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.165
Okay, so these are the numbers
I took from the table,

00:23:16.165 --> 00:23:19.696
that you see on the top left
there: 179 for C-O double bond

00:23:19.696 --> 00:23:20.548
and so on.
 

00:23:20.548 --> 00:23:25.730
And I sum them up and that's
361, for those bonds.

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:29.459
And the new set of bonds,
in the enol,

00:23:29.459 --> 00:23:30.769
sum to 343.
 

00:23:30.769 --> 00:23:34.183
So the ketone indeed is more
stable, it appears,

00:23:34.183 --> 00:23:36.000
by 18 kilocalories/mol.
 

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.550
So 18 kilocalories/mol means
that you have a factor of

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.936
10^13th;
the equilibrium constant is

00:23:43.936 --> 00:23:44.779
10^13.5.
 

00:23:44.779 --> 00:23:47.536
So it should lie,
for practical purposes,

00:23:47.536 --> 00:23:50.430
entirely in the direction of
the ketone.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:54.597
However, if you do it
experimentally,

00:23:54.597 --> 00:24:00.736
you find that the equilibrium
constant is only 10^7th,

00:24:00.736 --> 00:24:02.125
not 10^14th.
 

00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:03.400
Right?
 

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.170
So the true energy difference
is 9.3 kilocalories;

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:12.931
not the eighteen that we got by
adding bonds together.

00:24:12.931 --> 00:24:13.650
Right?
 

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:19.939
So that means we're going to
have to deal with addressing why

00:24:19.939 --> 00:24:22.558
the enol is too stable.
 

00:24:22.558 --> 00:24:26.346
It's 9 kilocalories/mol too
stable, compared to our

00:24:26.346 --> 00:24:30.359
predictions, on the basis of
adding bonds together.

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:31.558
Now why?
 

00:24:31.558 --> 00:24:36.872
Well one thing is that we --
that those bonds that we

00:24:36.872 --> 00:24:40.214
cancelled,
the C-H bonds that didn't

00:24:40.214 --> 00:24:44.647
change, in fact did change
between the starting material

00:24:44.647 --> 00:24:46.180
and the product.
 

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.420
Why could I say that they did
change?

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.865
In both cases,
on both sides,

00:24:49.865 --> 00:24:52.759
there are single carbon-carbon,
carbon-hydrogen bonds.

00:24:52.759 --> 00:24:54.641
How can I say they change?
 

00:24:54.641 --> 00:24:55.220
Angela?
 

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:58.077
Student:  Well with the
ketone, they're sp^3

00:24:58.077 --> 00:24:58.730
hybridized.
 

00:24:58.730 --> 00:24:59.140
Prof: Ah ha.
 

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.410
Student:  In the enol
they're sp^2 hybridized.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:02.240
Prof: Right.
 

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.640
They're changing hybridization.
 

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.847
Actually, yeah,
they go from sp^3 to

00:25:05.847 --> 00:25:08.318
sp^2, on the carbon,
as you go across.

00:25:08.318 --> 00:25:11.830
And the sp^2's on the
right should be more stable.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:12.269
Okay?
 

00:25:12.269 --> 00:25:14.720
So the sp^2-H should be
stronger.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.445
So these things that I was
saying cancelled do not actually

00:25:18.445 --> 00:25:21.529
cancel, if we take hybridization
into account.

00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:23.150
So that's one factor.
 

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:28.282
And there's another as well,
which is you have that unshared

00:25:28.282 --> 00:25:31.938
pair, on the top right here,
on the oxygen,

00:25:31.938 --> 00:25:34.808
is adjacent to a double bond.
 

00:25:34.808 --> 00:25:38.775
That means that this high HOMO
can be stabilized by the

00:25:38.775 --> 00:25:41.640
π* low LUMO;
it'll overlap.

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.108
That isn't a possibility here,
where the unshared pairs on the

00:25:46.108 --> 00:25:50.140
oxygen did not overlap with the
π* orbital.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.373
So you get intramolecular
HOMO/LUMO mixing in the enol

00:25:54.373 --> 00:25:57.170
that you don't get in the
ketone;

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.711
which will help stabilize the
enol, with that -- we could draw

00:26:00.711 --> 00:26:02.278
that resonance structure.
 

00:26:02.278 --> 00:26:06.652
So those two things together
make up that 9 kilocalorie

00:26:06.652 --> 00:26:08.979
error;
or at least we can think --

00:26:08.979 --> 00:26:10.970
they contribute to it at least.
 

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.166
So constitutional energy,
what we would get by adding

00:26:15.166 --> 00:26:19.661
bonds together,
has to be corrected for various

00:26:19.661 --> 00:26:23.077
"effects",
we'll call them,

00:26:23.077 --> 00:26:26.170
such as resonance,
that's what we just looked at,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:31.086
like this HOMO/LUMO thing,
such as hybridization changes,

00:26:31.086 --> 00:26:34.949
or such as strain,
as in the case of axial

00:26:34.949 --> 00:26:37.170
methylcyclohexane,
that we looked at.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.314
So there are lots and lots of
these corrections that you have

00:26:41.314 --> 00:26:44.883
to apply to this model,
where you add together bond

00:26:44.883 --> 00:26:48.560
energies in order to predict the
energies of a particular

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.348
molecule.
 

00:26:49.348 --> 00:26:52.750
But for many cases now,
you can do a pretty good job of

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:57.173
predicting these things,
and actually not do so bad at

00:26:57.173 --> 00:27:01.118
predicting relative energies of
isomers,

00:27:01.118 --> 00:27:03.108
and therefore equilibrium
constants.

00:27:03.108 --> 00:27:07.547
And these effects,
of course, are a polite name

00:27:07.547 --> 00:27:08.510
for error.
 

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:09.380
Right?
 

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.018
They're correcting -- various
ways of correcting errors that

00:27:13.018 --> 00:27:16.718
you think there should be in
this scheme of just adding bonds

00:27:16.718 --> 00:27:17.519
together.
 

00:27:17.519 --> 00:27:21.538
Now, energy determines what can
happen.

00:27:21.538 --> 00:27:24.582
Things always move toward
equilibrium.

00:27:24.582 --> 00:27:25.240
Right?
 

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:29.210
So if the ratio of two things
is something,

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.098
but the equilibrium ratio is
different,

00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:33.940
the ratio will always move
toward that,

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:39.160
toward the equilibrium,
if it's in isolation.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.628
But there's another equally
important thing is how fast will

00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:44.690
it go there?
 

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:48.817
And that, as we've seen before,
can be approximated as

00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:52.398
10^13th/second,
times this same kind of factor,

00:27:52.398 --> 00:27:54.578
relating to the barrier.
 

00:27:54.578 --> 00:28:01.959
Now both of these things
suggest that being low in energy

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:03.012
is good.
 

00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:04.200
Right?
 

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.180
You favor things that are low
in energy.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:09.058
But you might ask why?
 

00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:11.990
That's not what people say
about money.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:15.875
They don't say the less money
you have the better.

00:28:15.875 --> 00:28:16.509
Right?
 

00:28:16.509 --> 00:28:18.390
Why the less energy the better?
 

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:22.393
This is a really interesting
case, and it has to do with

00:28:22.393 --> 00:28:23.338
statistics.
 

00:28:23.338 --> 00:28:26.288
And especially at Yale we
should talk about this,

00:28:26.288 --> 00:28:30.202
because in 1902,
when Yale celebrated it's

00:28:30.202 --> 00:28:33.288
bicentennial,
they published a number of

00:28:33.288 --> 00:28:35.869
books showing off the
scholarship of Yale;

00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:38.000
as you can see here.
 

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.538
And the most important of those
books,

00:28:40.538 --> 00:28:42.942
by about 500 miles,
was this one:

00:28:42.942 --> 00:28:47.147
Elementary Principles in
Statistical Mechanics and the

00:28:47.147 --> 00:28:50.227
Rational Foundation of
Thermodynamics,

00:28:50.227 --> 00:28:52.329
by J. Willard Gibbs.
 

00:28:52.329 --> 00:28:55.480
So it's statistical mechanics.
 

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.567
It's trying to understand the
behavior of chemical substances,

00:28:59.567 --> 00:29:01.509
on the basis of statistics.
 

00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:06.890
Now when you do this,
you get exponents.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:11.961
And the organization of our
presentation here is going to

00:29:11.961 --> 00:29:17.577
have to do with three different
ways in which statistics enters

00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:21.136
into exponents,
for purposes of doing

00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:22.220
equilibrium.
 

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:26.140
So there's the Boltzmann Factor;
that's what we've been talking

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.125
about, the 10^(3/4
ΔH),

00:29:28.125 --> 00:29:30.278
that's called the Boltzmann
Factor.

00:29:30.278 --> 00:29:32.048
It includes the Boltzmann
Constant.

00:29:32.048 --> 00:29:36.297
Then there are things that have
to do with entropy,

00:29:36.297 --> 00:29:40.460
which often seems to be a very
confusing topic.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.000
And finally there's a thing
called the Law of Mass Action.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.920
And all of these things have
exponents in them.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.942
And if you understand how the
exponents behave,

00:29:49.942 --> 00:29:52.108
you understand what's going on.
 

00:29:52.108 --> 00:29:55.190
So let's look first at the
Boltzmann Factor.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:30:00.298
So here's Ludwig Boltzmann,
who committed suicide in 1906.

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:03.807
And this is his important paper
on "The Relationship

00:30:03.807 --> 00:30:07.252
between the Second Law of
Thermodynamics and Probability

00:30:07.252 --> 00:30:08.818
Calculations"
--

00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:11.807
so statistics --
"Regarding the Laws of

00:30:11.807 --> 00:30:14.380
Thermal Equilibrium,"
in 1877.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:20.205
And his key equation is S =
k lnW . So log relates to an

00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:24.058
exponential, and we'll see why
that is.

00:30:24.058 --> 00:30:27.798
And here's his tombstone in the
cemetery in Vienna.

00:30:27.798 --> 00:30:31.825
And you'll notice,
up at the top there,

00:30:31.825 --> 00:30:33.731
S = k ln W.
 

00:30:33.731 --> 00:30:34.578
Okay?
 

00:30:34.578 --> 00:30:39.661
So what Boltzmann considered
was the implication of random

00:30:39.661 --> 00:30:41.890
distribution of energy.
 

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.662
Suppose you have a certain
amount of energy,

00:30:44.662 --> 00:30:47.434
in a system,
but it's distributed at random.

00:30:47.434 --> 00:30:48.079
Right?
 

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.828
So purely statistically.
 

00:30:49.828 --> 00:30:51.858
Then how should it be
distributed?

00:30:51.858 --> 00:30:55.082
How much energy should any
particular molecule have,

00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:56.220
is the question.
 

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.640
And we can visualize this in a
simple case, which is very like

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.625
what he did, except he did it
analytically and in a much

00:31:04.625 --> 00:31:05.930
bigger system.
 

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.348
But just using four containers,
which are like molecules,

00:31:09.348 --> 00:31:12.828
and each one can have a certain
amount of energy in it.

00:31:12.828 --> 00:31:16.318
And we'll consider the energy
to be -- to come in bits.

00:31:16.318 --> 00:31:19.636
He used that idea,
that there were bits of energy

00:31:19.636 --> 00:31:23.438
to be distributed among
molecules, or degrees of freedom

00:31:23.438 --> 00:31:24.890
within molecules.
 

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.750
He didn't think that energy
came in bits,

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.160
but it made it possible to do
the statistics,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.960
and then he just took the limit
when these bits get very,

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:35.482
very, very, very small,
so that it becomes like a

00:31:35.482 --> 00:31:39.029
continuum of stuff,
like a whole sand of energy

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.558
bits.
 

00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:43.421
But anyhow, let's just count up
how many different ways there

00:31:43.421 --> 00:31:46.640
are of putting three different
bits of energy --

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:48.950
or actually not different,
they're all the same --

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:53.570
but three bits of energy into
the red container.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.259
Okay?
 

00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:57.618
So if you -- how many
complexions --

00:31:57.618 --> 00:31:59.884
that's what,
any particular arrangement he

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:02.848
called a complexion --
how many different complexions

00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:05.798
have a certain number of bits in
the first container?

00:32:05.798 --> 00:32:10.105
Well suppose you put all three
of those energy bits into the

00:32:10.105 --> 00:32:11.420
first container.
 

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.450
How many different ways are
there of doing that?

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.838
Just one. Okay?
 

00:32:16.838 --> 00:32:20.210
But suppose you put only two
into the first container?

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.009
Now how many different ways are
there of arranging it so that

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:24.829
there are two in the first
container?

00:32:24.829 --> 00:32:26.740
How many different ways?
 

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.930
There are three: 1,2, 3.
 

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.978
So there'll be three ways of
putting two bits in the first

00:32:33.978 --> 00:32:34.618
container.
 

00:32:34.618 --> 00:32:37.289
How many of putting one in the
first container?

00:32:37.289 --> 00:32:40.740
Well we put one there;
there's 1,2,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:45.680
3,4, 5,6 ways of doing it.
 

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.009
Okay?
 

00:32:47.009 --> 00:32:49.170
So there's six ways of putting
one in there.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.690
And how many of putting none at
all in there?

00:32:51.690 --> 00:33:04.769
1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7,8, 9,10. Okay?
 

00:33:04.769 --> 00:33:06.578
So there are 10 ways of doing
that.

00:33:06.578 --> 00:33:10.125
So let's make a graph and see
how many ways -- what's the

00:33:10.125 --> 00:33:14.049
probability that you'll have a
certain number of bits of energy

00:33:14.049 --> 00:33:15.759
in the first container?
 

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:21.920
Okay, it looks like that:
10,6, 3,1.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:27.705
And what does that curve look
like, if you made a plot of

00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:28.430
that?
 

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.000
What type of curve does it look
like?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.538
Is it a straight line?
 

00:33:34.538 --> 00:33:38.164
Anybody got a name for it,
or something that looks a

00:33:38.164 --> 00:33:39.799
little bit like that?
 

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:42.068
Student:  Exponential.
 

00:33:42.068 --> 00:33:43.529
Prof: It's exponential
decay.

00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:46.824
Now it's not truly exponential,
in this case,

00:33:46.824 --> 00:33:49.670
of three bits among four
containers.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:54.876
But if you do 30 bits among 20
containers, then it looks like

00:33:54.876 --> 00:33:57.741
that, and there is an
exponential.

00:33:57.741 --> 00:33:58.608
Right?
 

00:33:58.608 --> 00:34:02.700
So what Boltzmann was able to
do, to show mathematically,

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.108
was that the limit,
when you have very many,

00:34:05.108 --> 00:34:09.900
very small energy bits,
is truly an exponential.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:13.429
So the probability of having a
certain amount of energy,

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:15.869
in a degree of freedom,
is exponential:

00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:19.400
e^-(whatever that energy is,
divided by kT).

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.606
So Boltzmann showed that that
was the limit for lots of

00:34:22.606 --> 00:34:24.268
infinitesimal energy bits.
 

00:34:24.268 --> 00:34:27.440
And the idea behind it is quite
clear.

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:31.197
If all the complexions for a
given total are equally likely

00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:34.179
-- and that's what he assumes;
it's random,

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.726
they can be any place they want
to be -- then shifting energy

00:34:38.726 --> 00:34:42.289
into any one degree of freedom,
of one molecule,

00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:43.730
is disfavored.
 

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.315
Because when you put more in
one molecule,

00:34:46.315 --> 00:34:49.596
there are fewer ways to
distribute the rest among the

00:34:49.596 --> 00:34:50.289
others.
 

00:34:50.289 --> 00:34:53.360
So there'll be fewer ways,
the more you put in this one.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:54.289
Is that clear?
 

00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:56.110
Because that's really the key
concept.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:35:00.070
The more bits of energy you put
in this one, the fewer different

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.590
ways there are of permuting
what's left among the others.

00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:04.219
Right?
 

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:06.590
And it's exponential. Right?
 

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:10.297
So if you have fewer ways among
the others, then it's less

00:35:10.297 --> 00:35:10.753
likely.
 

00:35:10.753 --> 00:35:11.340
Right?
 

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.677
So it turns out that if you do
this, the average energy is

00:35:15.677 --> 00:35:19.329
½ kT,
in this degree of freedom;

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:24.088
which is to say that k,
the Boltzmann Constant,

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:27.679
relates temperature to average
energy;

00:35:27.679 --> 00:35:31.940
which is to say that
temperature is

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:33.449
average energy.
 

00:35:33.449 --> 00:35:39.009
Temperature and average energy
at equilibrium are the same

00:35:39.009 --> 00:35:40.570
thing -- okay?
 

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:41.989
-- for each degree of freedom.
 

00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:44.994
You can put -- what did we mean
by these little buckets into

00:35:44.994 --> 00:35:46.420
which we could put energy?
 

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.969
We had a way of putting energy
into the molecule,

00:35:48.969 --> 00:35:52.440
like stretching this bond,
or stretching this bond,

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.693
or bending some bonds,
or torsion, or something like

00:35:55.693 --> 00:35:56.139
that.
 

00:35:56.139 --> 00:36:00.780
Now truly, we deal with quantum
states.

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.715
So you put energy into
different quantum states and you

00:36:03.715 --> 00:36:06.980
count up the quantum states,
to see how likely things are.

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.320
Okay, so that's where the
Boltzmann Factor is.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.987
That exponential,
that e to the -- exponential

00:36:14.987 --> 00:36:19.713
¾ ΔH comes
just because that's what you

00:36:19.713 --> 00:36:20.610
expect.
 

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.909
If you randomly distribute
things, it'll come out that way.

00:36:23.909 --> 00:36:26.769
Now how about the entropy
factor?

00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:28.130
And this one is fun.
 

00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:32.300
Feynman, in his wonderful
Lectures on Physics,

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:38.083
says: "It is the change
from an ordered arrangement to a

00:36:38.083 --> 00:36:42.045
disordered arrangement,
which is the source of

00:36:42.045 --> 00:36:43.369
irreversibly."
 

00:36:43.369 --> 00:36:47.320
Have you heard this said,
that entropy is disorder,

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:52.219
and that you increase entropy
in order to increase disorder?

00:36:52.219 --> 00:36:55.150
Okay, so that's what Feynman is
saying here.

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.809
"The change from an
ordered arrangement to a

00:36:57.809 --> 00:36:59.416
disordered arrangement."
 

00:36:59.416 --> 00:36:59.860
Okay.
 

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.110
Now here are two arrangements
of the same number of dots.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:06.599
Which one is more ordered,
left or right?

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:08.719
Students:  Left.
 

00:37:08.719 --> 00:37:09.755
Prof: Okay.
 

00:37:09.755 --> 00:37:11.829
You know I'm setting you up,
right?

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:15.217
So you're -- but I know what
you would have voted for.

00:37:15.217 --> 00:37:15.730
Right?
 

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.255
So I'm not going to ask you to
vote.

00:37:18.255 --> 00:37:18.760
Okay?
 

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.532
But look at the one on the
right, from a different point of

00:37:23.532 --> 00:37:24.110
view.
 

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:31.190
&gt;
 

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:35.179
So what do you conclude?
 

00:37:35.179 --> 00:37:37.030
Which one is more ordered?
 

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:42.375
The one on the right is just as
ordered as the one on the left,

00:37:42.375 --> 00:37:45.134
but we didn't perceive the
order.

00:37:45.134 --> 00:37:45.909
Okay?
 

00:37:45.909 --> 00:37:50.141
And that's like constellations;
you know, the shepherds lay out

00:37:50.141 --> 00:37:53.969
and saw bears and dragons and
things, in the sky -- right?

00:37:53.969 --> 00:37:56.021
-- and thought they were
ordered.

00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:56.469
Okay?
 

00:37:56.469 --> 00:38:00.559
Now disorder,
reversibility and Couette flow.

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:05.402
Now I brought an experiment to
do here, and it's -- but I'm not

00:38:05.402 --> 00:38:07.590
really sure it would work.
 

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:10.097
So what I'm going to do --
because I didn't practice it

00:38:10.097 --> 00:38:10.840
before I came.
 

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.853
I've done it before,
but I didn't practice it today,

00:38:12.853 --> 00:38:15.144
and my pipette broke and I had
to get a new one made before

00:38:15.144 --> 00:38:15.539
class.
 

00:38:15.539 --> 00:38:17.945
So if you want to see that,
come after class and we'll try

00:38:17.945 --> 00:38:18.960
the actual experiment.
 

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.730
But I'm going to show you a
movie of it instead.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.590
Here.
 

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.639
So this is the same thing here.
 

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:28.840
What it is, is a -- well you'll
see in the movie.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.989
I'll just start it up.
 

00:38:30.989 --> 00:38:33.159
&gt;
 

00:38:33.159 --> 00:38:36.177
Prof: Okay,
so it's a glass rod that goes

00:38:36.177 --> 00:38:38.039
up inside a glass cylinder.
 

00:38:38.039 --> 00:38:41.659
So there's like a doughnut
inside, right?

00:38:41.659 --> 00:38:44.389
So I'm now going to pour Karo
syrup in there;

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:46.260
I brought Karo syrup with me to
show you.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:51.664
So it's in that annulus between
the rod and the cylinder.

00:38:51.664 --> 00:38:52.340
Okay?
 

00:38:52.340 --> 00:39:00.135
And now I'm going to take some
yellow dye and put a strip of it

00:39:00.135 --> 00:39:02.547
--
first I'm going to mark it,

00:39:02.547 --> 00:39:04.775
so I can tell --
I'm going to rotate that

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:06.726
outside cylinder,
so you can see that it's

00:39:06.726 --> 00:39:07.199
rotating.
 

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:11.317
And I'm putting a strip of
yellow dye between the rod and

00:39:11.317 --> 00:39:12.420
the cylinder.
 

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.150
Everybody see what I'm doing?
 

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.880
And then I'm going to stir it
up.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.418
And the way I'm going to stir
it is by rotating the outside

00:39:20.418 --> 00:39:21.090
cylinder.
 

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.498
Okay, so we'll zoom in and
you'll see the watch,

00:39:24.498 --> 00:39:27.615
not very well,
but to show that I'm not just

00:39:27.615 --> 00:39:30.371
running the movie backward or
anything.

00:39:30.371 --> 00:39:31.170
Okay?
 

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:34.170
Okay, now I start rotating the
outside.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.318
So there's one rotation,
two rotations,

00:39:37.318 --> 00:39:38.809
three rotations.
 

00:39:38.809 --> 00:39:39.980
So now it's all mixed up.
 

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.480
And now watch.
 

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.360
I'm unrotating.
 

00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:50.159
And it comes back.
 

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:53.880
So if you want to see that
happen, we'll try it after class

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:54.329
here.
 

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:56.880
Student:  Oh wow.
 

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.480
Prof: So you unmix
things.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.936
That doesn't sound like entropy
is working right.

00:40:01.936 --> 00:40:02.440
Okay?
 

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.268
Now here's the way it actually
happened.

00:40:08.268 --> 00:40:10.561
So there was the syrup,
between the rod and the

00:40:10.561 --> 00:40:13.012
cylinder --
a look down from the top -- and

00:40:13.012 --> 00:40:15.050
we put a strip of ink in
between,

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.039
and then started rotating.
 

00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:19.735
And as we rotated,
the ink spread out,

00:40:19.735 --> 00:40:20.463
like this.
 

00:40:20.463 --> 00:40:21.119
Right?
 

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:24.306
Because the outer part moved,
and the inner part didn't move,

00:40:24.306 --> 00:40:26.380
where it was in contact with
the rod.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.119
So after I'd done three
rotations, it looked like that.

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:33.610
It wasn't really evenly mixed
up.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:36.318
It's just that when we looked
at it, it looked like it was

00:40:36.318 --> 00:40:37.269
mixed up -- right?
 

00:40:37.269 --> 00:40:38.170
-- when we looked through it.
 

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:41.793
And now when we unrotate it,
the whole thing -- nothing

00:40:41.793 --> 00:40:44.949
diffused and molecules didn't
move at random.

00:40:44.949 --> 00:40:47.610
They just got spread out that
way, but in a particular way.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:51.960
So it came back again. Okay?
 

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:55.489
So the rotated state only
seemed to be

00:40:55.489 --> 00:40:56.389
disordered.
 

00:40:56.389 --> 00:40:58.750
So that's the basis of the
trick.

00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.340
Right?
 

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:02.809
But that raises a very
fundamental question.

00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:07.869
If disorder is in the mind of
the beholder --

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:10.050
in this case,
or in the case of that

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.255
dinosaur,
connect the dots -- if disorder

00:41:13.255 --> 00:41:17.222
is in the mind of the beholder,
how can it measure a

00:41:17.222 --> 00:41:19.612
fundamental property,
like entropy,

00:41:19.612 --> 00:41:22.110
if it depends on who's looking
at it,

00:41:22.110 --> 00:41:25.833
to say whether it's disordered
or not?

00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:26.639
Right?
 

00:41:26.639 --> 00:41:30.369
In fact, a disordered
arrangement is an oxymoron,

00:41:30.369 --> 00:41:34.411
because arrangement is
arrangement, and disordered is

00:41:34.411 --> 00:41:35.655
not arrangement.
 

00:41:35.655 --> 00:41:36.510
Right?
 

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:39.809
So how can you have a
disordered arrangement,

00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:42.059
if the shepherd sees a dragon?
 

00:41:42.059 --> 00:41:42.659
Okay?
 

00:41:42.659 --> 00:41:46.059
The situation favored at
equilibrium,

00:41:46.059 --> 00:41:50.980
by entropy, is one where
particles have diffused every

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:55.208
which-away,
not into a coiled up piece of

00:41:55.208 --> 00:42:00.820
paper like the yellow thing,
or not into a dinosaur.

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.030
Every which-away;
the key word is 'every'.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.300
That's what's statistical about
it.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:11.202
A disordered arrangement is a
code word for a collection of

00:42:11.202 --> 00:42:14.702
random distributions,
whose individual structures are

00:42:14.702 --> 00:42:15.780
not obvious.
 

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:18.043
So if a thing looks like,
you know, a regular lattice

00:42:18.043 --> 00:42:19.306
like that, I say,
"Ah ha,

00:42:19.306 --> 00:42:20.829
that's a regular lattice."
 

00:42:20.829 --> 00:42:24.309
But if it looks like this,
I don't say it's exactly that;

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:26.728
I say it's disordered,
by which I mean I can't tell

00:42:26.728 --> 00:42:28.858
the difference between that one
and this one,

00:42:28.858 --> 00:42:30.018
or this one,
or this one.

00:42:30.018 --> 00:42:30.599
Right?
 

00:42:30.599 --> 00:42:34.148
So there are a whole bunch of
those arrangements that I count

00:42:34.148 --> 00:42:36.219
together when I say
'disordered'.

00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:37.719
It's a collective word.
 

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:40.239
So if all of them are equally
likely,

00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:43.679
it's much more likely to have
disordered --

00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:46.826
many, many, many arrangements
-- than the particular ordered

00:42:46.826 --> 00:42:50.344
ones that we're thinking about,
even if they're all equally

00:42:50.344 --> 00:42:50.849
likely.
 

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:52.010
So that's the idea.
 

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:55.818
It is favored at equilibrium
because it includes so many

00:42:55.818 --> 00:42:57.690
individual distributions.
 

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:03.119
So entropy is actually
counting, in disguise.

00:43:03.119 --> 00:43:06.639
You count all these different
arrangements,

00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:08.280
or all the different quantum
levels,

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.190
and the more you have,
under a certain name,

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:15.889
the higher the entropy
associated with that name is.

00:43:15.889 --> 00:43:20.202
So, for example,
a very common value of the

00:43:20.202 --> 00:43:26.670
entropy difference between two
things is 1.377 entropy units.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.559
That seems a weird number,
right?

00:43:29.559 --> 00:43:36.193
Now 1.377 happens to be
R times the natural log

00:43:36.193 --> 00:43:37.320
of two.
 

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:44.730
Now, consider the difference in
entropy between gauche and

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.289
anti-butane.
 

00:43:46.289 --> 00:43:47.329
Okay?
 

00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:53.719
So the equilibrium constant is
e^(-ΔG/RT).

00:43:53.719 --> 00:43:55.018
Do you remember what G
is?

00:43:55.018 --> 00:44:00.340
That's the Gibbs Free Energy,
which includes both heat,

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.277
both the kind of things -- bond
energy that we've been talking

00:44:03.277 --> 00:44:06.338
about --
and entropy is included in

00:44:06.338 --> 00:44:07.429
there too.
 

00:44:07.429 --> 00:44:10.324
So we can split it apart,
into the part that has to do

00:44:10.324 --> 00:44:11.916
with heat --
or enthalpy,

00:44:11.916 --> 00:44:15.018
the ΔH between the
two things,

00:44:15.018 --> 00:44:18.300
gauche and anti -- and
TΔS,

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.309
the part that has to do with
entropy.

00:44:20.309 --> 00:44:24.750
I suspect you've seen this
G=H+TS before;

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:26.440
H-TS before.
 

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.070
But let's just split it apart.
 

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.552
Since they're in the exponent
we can multiply two things

00:44:31.552 --> 00:44:32.050
together.
 

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.882
So we have the first part,
the one we've been dealing

00:44:34.882 --> 00:44:36.409
with, 3/4thsΔH.
 

00:44:36.409 --> 00:44:36.900
Right?
 

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.550
And then we have the red part,
that has to do with entropy.

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:41.320
But you can simplify that.
 

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:45.146
How can you simplify the part
that has to do with entropy,

00:44:45.146 --> 00:44:46.489
right off the bat?
 

00:44:46.489 --> 00:44:47.309
Student: Cancel the
T's.

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:49.300
Prof: Cancel the
T's.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.199
Okay, so it's actually
ΔS/R.

00:44:52.199 --> 00:44:58.750
Now suppose that the value of
ΔS is Rln2;

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:01.706
which I said was a very common
entropy difference.

00:45:01.706 --> 00:45:02.190
Right?
 

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:04.360
Now you can simplify it further.
 

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:08.052
Can you see how to simplify it
further, for that particular

00:45:08.052 --> 00:45:09.389
entropy difference?
 

00:45:09.389 --> 00:45:11.489
Well obviously the R's cancel.
 

00:45:11.489 --> 00:45:15.510
And what's E raised to
the power ln2?

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:16.409
Student:  Two.
 

00:45:16.409 --> 00:45:17.932
Prof: Two.
 

00:45:17.932 --> 00:45:22.684
So actually what that is,
is our 3/4thsΔH

00:45:22.684 --> 00:45:23.849
times two.
 

00:45:23.849 --> 00:45:28.873
So when you see 1.377 entropy
units, that's somebody who likes

00:45:28.873 --> 00:45:33.570
math telling you that's there a
factor of two involved.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.440
That sounds more reasonable.
 

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.054
Right?
 

00:45:37.054 --> 00:45:37.670
Two.
 

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:42.590
Why should there be a factor of
two, that favors gauche- over

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:43.739
anti-butane?
 

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:48.699
Yes?
 

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:50.239
Student:  There are
twice as many gauches.

00:45:50.239 --> 00:45:52.648
Prof: There are twice as
many gauches as there are

00:45:52.648 --> 00:45:54.885
anti's, because it can be
right-handed or left-handed

00:45:54.885 --> 00:45:55.360
gauche.
 

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.840
So you see what a crock this
is, to say that the entropy

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.565
difference between gauche- and
anti-butane is 1.377 entropy

00:46:04.565 --> 00:46:05.380
units?
 

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:08.902
It's just that there are twice
as many of one as the other.

00:46:08.902 --> 00:46:09.389
Right?
 

00:46:09.389 --> 00:46:12.864
So that, the fact that
ΔS occurs in an

00:46:12.864 --> 00:46:17.172
exponent, is just a complicated
way of telling you that there's

00:46:17.172 --> 00:46:18.909
a statistical factor.
 

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:21.976
You have to count how many of
these things there are.

00:46:21.976 --> 00:46:22.389
Okay?
 

00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:24.269
Because you have two gauche
butanes.

00:46:24.269 --> 00:46:27.619
So the conclusion;
it just means a factor of two.

00:46:27.619 --> 00:46:32.175
And then that the equilibrium
constant depends on temperature,

00:46:32.175 --> 00:46:36.730
because of ΔH,
not because of ΔS.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.092
Often people think that because
the free energy is H and

00:46:41.092 --> 00:46:45.101
TS, that therefore the
entropy thing is changing as

00:46:45.101 --> 00:46:46.579
T changes.
 

00:46:46.579 --> 00:46:49.894
But in fact that's not true,
because you divide by T

00:46:49.894 --> 00:46:51.724
to get anything out of it again.
 

00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:52.239
Right?
 

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:55.503
So what really changes with
temperature is the contribution

00:46:55.503 --> 00:46:56.909
due to ΔH.
 

00:46:56.909 --> 00:47:01.829
So sometimes that's just used
to obscure what is fundamentally

00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:02.960
very simple.
 

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.239
Okay, we're going to stop here.
 

00:47:06.239 --> 00:47:10.277
And just so everybody's on the
same page, we'll have the final

00:47:10.277 --> 00:47:11.800
lecture on Wednesday.
 

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.126
But then I'll be here at class
time on Friday too,

00:47:15.126 --> 00:47:19.199
and we can have a discussion
then, to review for the exam.

00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:21.063
And I'm willing to have another
one.

00:47:21.063 --> 00:47:21.650
I forget.
 

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:23.989
When did I say? On Monday night.
 

00:47:23.989 --> 00:47:27.443
Now do people have -- there are
not exams at night,

00:47:27.443 --> 00:47:29.239
are there; or are there?
 

00:47:29.239 --> 00:47:33.456
Does anybody have a -- is
Monday night okay to have the

00:47:33.456 --> 00:47:34.159
review?
 

00:47:34.159 --> 00:47:37.440
It's probably the best time to
have it, so you have a full day

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:39.000
after that before the exam.
 

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.157
So I'll get a room for next
Monday night,

00:47:41.157 --> 00:47:43.530
a week from tonight,
for a review session.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:45.719
But also I'll be here on Friday
at lecture time.

00:47:45.719 --> 00:47:47.409
So we'll see you.
 

00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:50.469
If anybody wants to see this
experiment, we'll do it.

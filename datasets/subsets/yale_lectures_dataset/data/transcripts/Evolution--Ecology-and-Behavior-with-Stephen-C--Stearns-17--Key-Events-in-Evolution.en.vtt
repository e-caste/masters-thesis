00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.564
Prof: Okay,
we're in the middle of the

00:00:05.564 --> 00:00:07.890
section on macroevolution.
 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.069
We've had three lectures about
macroevolutionary principles:

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.650
speciation;
how to build a tree;

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.200
and then what kinds of uses you
can put a phylogenetic tree to.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.440
Now we're going to do three
lectures on different ways to

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.640
look at the history of life.
 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.460
And the first cut,
the first lecture,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.086
the one today,
is an abstract conceptual view

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:33.126
of the history of life,
and it looks at it as a series

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:37.353
of major transitions in the
organization of life and how

00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.660
information is transmitted.
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.660
And this is the structure of
the lecture.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.753
We'll talk about what life is,
how we think it originated,

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:48.412
the origin of cells and
eukaryotes, some other key

00:00:48.412 --> 00:00:51.477
events;
and then we'll summarize with

00:00:51.477 --> 00:00:55.391
the principles that are involved
in key events,

00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:58.540
in major transitions in
evolution.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.274
Well, life is basically
anything that has the properties

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:06.718
of multiplication,
variation in heredity,

00:01:06.718 --> 00:01:08.438
plus metabolism.
 

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:14.516
So it's not necessarily
carbon-based or silicon-based or

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:18.616
based on anything else;
it has these abstract

00:01:18.616 --> 00:01:19.379
properties.
 

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:24.611
And what we really mean by
metabolism is something about

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:26.230
thermodynamics.
 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.031
A living thing that has
metabolism is using free energy

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:32.989
that it's getting from the
environment,

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:37.410
and it's using that to maintain
a partially isolated system--

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.995
it's a local system;
your body is a partially

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.412
isolated local system--
and it's doing so to keep it in

00:01:43.412 --> 00:01:46.266
an ordered state--
it's preserving the information

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.810
that evolution and development
have given it--

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.920
and it's doing so against an
entropy gradient.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.720
So basically we eat energy and
we excrete entropy,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.516
and the next time you're
looking at the toilet flushing

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.500
down,
think about all that entropy

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.629
that you're putting down into
the system.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:07.959
Okay?
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.389
So this is what metabolism does.
 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:17.151
Now if you try to do
experiments in the laboratory in

00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:22.280
which you're watching the
evolution of RNA molecules,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.520
or if you try to do in silico
experiments in the computer in

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.330
which you are looking at the
origin of structures--

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.848
and that can get to be pretty
sophisticated stuff--

00:02:32.848 --> 00:02:34.740
you're not dealing with a
living system.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.120
That's artificial.
 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.348
Because with RNA,
we're providing the metabolism,

00:02:39.348 --> 00:02:43.258
we're putting the ATP and the
enzymes into the test tubes,

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.729
and in programs for artificial
life,

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.979
the things that are evolving in
the computer are actually

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:52.461
getting their energy basically
from the electrical cable that

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:56.568
we've got plugged into the wall,
feeding the computer.

00:02:56.568 --> 00:03:01.371
So if you can get,
independent of any human

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:04.199
intervention,
any system that's got

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.538
multiplication,
variation and heredity--so the

00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:08.580
basics to make natural selection
work--

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.551
and you can arrange metabolism,
then it's going to start to

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:17.688
evolve,
and it will be alive.

00:03:17.688 --> 00:03:23.800
So our problem is to figure out
how did this all get going?

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.239
The first major transition was
the transition from an abiotic

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.550
world to a living world;
the origin of life.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.613
And to do that we had to get
multiplication,

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:36.250
variation, heredity and
metabolism.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.388
And the answer is increasingly
that it is likely that

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:45.635
metabolism came first,
and that heredity and

00:03:45.635 --> 00:03:51.461
multiplication came second;
variation was probably there

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.038
from the start.
 

00:03:53.038 --> 00:03:56.062
So I'm going to actually dwell
on some things that are now

00:03:56.062 --> 00:03:59.105
chemically fairly trivial,
and some things that are

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.930
logically non-trivial and
involve paradoxes.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.030
Because this is an area that we
know it did happen;

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.491
and we can now break down the
steps in increasing detail,

00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.590
but important things are not
understood.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.430
So the environment at the
origin.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.093
Gosh, I went through this thing
yesterday and I got all the

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:22.939
words on it, and then I start
talking and they're not there.

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.750
So the environment at the
origin.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.810
The Big Bang is now dated at
about 13.5 billion years.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.850
It was just a few years ago it
was dated at 20 billion years.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.187
So the universe,
as we know it,

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:43.860
is a big younger than I had
thought a decade ago.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.353
And in stars,
the nuclei of all of the

00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:53.819
elements were synthesized out of
hydrogen,

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.952
basically, and some of the
novae and supernovae created

00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:04.040
things that are heavier than
iron;

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.723
and a lot of that is important
cofactors for enzymes in your

00:05:08.723 --> 00:05:09.278
body.
 

00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:13.454
You could not actually function
biochemically as you do if you

00:05:13.454 --> 00:05:17.559
did not have things that had
been cooked up in the explosions

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:18.860
of giant stars.
 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.767
Now the solar system is formed
basically from recycled star

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:26.538
stuff,
about 5 to 4.5 billion years

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.271
ago, and there's intense
planetoid bombardment of the

00:05:30.271 --> 00:05:33.069
inner planets going on at that
time.

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:35.795
Nothing living could have
existed on the face of the

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:38.519
earth, because temperatures were
simply too high;

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:43.223
the surface of the planet was
really a toxic wasteland of

00:05:43.223 --> 00:05:47.507
boiling lava and very,
very extreme temperatures and

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:48.180
pHs.
 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.000
The initial atmosphere got
blown off.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.591
The moon was formed,
possibly because of the impact

00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:57.829
of a large planetoid that hit
the forming earth and actually

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:59.769
blew a chunk of it off.
 

00:05:59.769 --> 00:06:02.029
And at that point the earth had
short days;

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.329
it was spinning very rapidly.
 

00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:07.281
It had condensed from a cloud
of stuff, and as it fell in,

00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.470
it brought angular momentum
into the system.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.810
And so the earth started off
with a higher rotation speed

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.670
than it currently has.
 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:22.920
Then about a billion years
after the planet forms,

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.980
the atmosphere is reducing,
the temperature has fallen to

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.329
where liquid water can exist on
the surface of the planet.

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:35.009
And life probably originates on
a positively charged mineral

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:38.877
surface, and it seems now likely
that it was probably at a deep

00:06:38.877 --> 00:06:40.250
hydrothermal vent.
 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.562
So there was a hot
high-pressure acid around a

00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:48.110
positively charged mineral
surface.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.810
There was a lot of chemical
energy at that interface.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.420
We don't know that for sure,
but this does seem to be the

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.937
kind of a context in which you
can get certain chemical

00:06:57.937 --> 00:07:01.709
reactions to work,
that won't work elsewhere.

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.879
So you need the building blocks
of life.

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:07.569
You need linear lipids;
they can make membranes and

00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.920
they can make compartments.
 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.040
You need amino acids to make
proteins.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.879
You need purines and
pyrimidines to make nucleotides.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.410
You need sugars and phosphates
to link things together.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.394
And so there's a branch of
Origin of Life research that

00:07:21.394 --> 00:07:25.528
specializes in the chemical
conditions under which you'll

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.670
get this building blocks.
 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.944
And then after you get the
building blocks,

00:07:29.944 --> 00:07:33.194
and get them to work together,
you need things that will make

00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:34.550
copies of themselves.
 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.439
So if you can get reproduction,
variation in reproductive

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:39.812
success, some kind of
inheritance, then natural

00:07:39.812 --> 00:07:41.310
selection will take over.
 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.666
If you can get some kind of
primitive genetic molecule,

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:49.699
it can get honed into an RNA or
a DNA structure.

00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:52.339
If you can get some kind of
primitive cell,

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:56.800
with a very simple membrane,
then natural selection can hone

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.538
it into a selective filter,
where there are pores in the

00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:02.740
cell that let certain things in
and out,

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.470
and so forth.
 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:08.519
So you have to have--you can
start with fairly simple things,

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:12.028
and natural selection will
refine them fairly rapidly,

00:08:12.028 --> 00:08:16.420
but you have to start with at
least these simple things.

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.290
So that's kind of a bootstrap
operation.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.865
You've got to get those first
replicators up and running

00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:26.767
before natural selection will
take over and create complexity

00:08:26.767 --> 00:08:30.540
and precision and make it into a
sophisticated system.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.168
So how do you get the building
blocks?

00:08:33.168 --> 00:08:35.558
Well there were some very
interesting experiments,

00:08:35.558 --> 00:08:38.320
done by a grad student at the
University of Chicago,

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.668
Stanley Miller,
working with Harold Urey,

00:08:40.668 --> 00:08:49.200
and what basically he did was
he would put methane,

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.350
nitrogen, ammonia,
ammonia chloride;

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.654
he would put in carbon
monoxide, nitrogen,

00:08:55.654 --> 00:08:58.580
hydrogen, different kinds of
mixtures, into a vessel,

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:01.730
and then he would pass an
electric spark through it.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:07.024
And he found that it was fairly
easy to get these amino acids to

00:09:07.024 --> 00:09:07.950
fall out.
 

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.774
And, by the way,
most of this guy's Ph.D.

00:09:09.774 --> 00:09:12.240
thesis consisted not of
performing that experiment,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.221
but of doing the analytical
chemistry afterwards to convince

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.950
everybody that this was actually
what he had gotten.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:18.359
Okay?
 

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:22.140
In 1953, that was not so easy;
we didn't have all these

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.676
beautiful gas chromatographs and
whatnot to do the

00:09:24.676 --> 00:09:25.658
identifications.
 

00:09:25.658 --> 00:09:29.095
Okay, so the basic structure of
this is that you make something

00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:31.268
out of fairly small,
simple molecules,

00:09:31.268 --> 00:09:33.860
likely to be in the atmosphere
or in the water,

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:39.288
on the surface of the earth,
3.5 to 4 billion years ago.

00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:42.601
And you give it some energy in
the form of an electric charge,

00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:44.067
or you heat it,
or whatever,

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:45.750
and you see what comes out.
 

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.360
So amino acids are pretty easy.
 

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.523
When I was 15-years-old,
I was fascinated by this

00:09:51.523 --> 00:09:55.240
experiment in high school,
and I tried to repeat it,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.519
and I blew up the chemistry
lab,

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:02.928
and I produced a toxic cloud of
cyanide gas--

00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:05.788
which you can get out of these
guys--

00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:08.879
and that caused the evacuation
of the entire building,

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.379
with 200 students sitting
outside on the lawn,

00:10:11.379 --> 00:10:13.190
in the middle of morning
classes;

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.009
it was deeply satisfactory.
 

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:18.158
&gt;
 

00:10:18.158 --> 00:10:22.196
Okay, so we have a bit of
ambivalence on this issue of

00:10:22.196 --> 00:10:23.720
abiotic synthesis.
 

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.950
Some things we get real easy.
 

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.245
Okay?
 

00:10:25.245 --> 00:10:27.080
We get amino acids,
fatty acids,

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.210
sugars and purines pretty
easily.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:30.899
Some things are hard.
 

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.158
So pyrimadine nucleotides;
ribose is not so easy.

00:10:35.158 --> 00:10:38.288
A linear, long-chain,
fatty acid, that you might find

00:10:38.288 --> 00:10:41.779
really useful for making a
membrane, that's not so easy.

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:45.149
And it's not easy to get these
things all in the same synthetic

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:45.908
environment.
 

00:10:45.908 --> 00:10:49.379
So you have to imagine that
well perhaps we're getting

00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:52.980
different chemical reactions
going on in different micro

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:58.178
environments,
and they're mixing somehow.

00:10:58.178 --> 00:11:01.216
But then once we've got the
building blocks,

00:11:01.216 --> 00:11:04.961
you run into what is not a
chemical synthesis problem,

00:11:04.961 --> 00:11:08.139
you run into an abstract
logical problem.

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:08.552
Okay?
 

00:11:08.552 --> 00:11:10.860
That's the error threshold.
 

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:14.674
So the amount of information
that you can maintain by

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:17.830
selection is limited by copying
fidelity.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.489
Basically what that says is
that if you have a very high

00:11:22.489 --> 00:11:25.703
mutation rate,
you are destroying all of the

00:11:25.703 --> 00:11:28.028
information that you've
accumulated,

00:11:28.028 --> 00:11:31.133
and you're not transmitting
enough of it to the next

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:34.480
generation to be able to
usefully accumulate information

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.549
on how to do something better.
 

00:11:36.549 --> 00:11:40.918
So that's the error threshold.
 

00:11:40.918 --> 00:11:45.364
If you don't really have high
copying fidelity,

00:11:45.364 --> 00:11:48.360
then mutations will kill you.
 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.892
And if you have a small
genome--basically if you have a

00:11:52.892 --> 00:11:57.090
small genome that's big enough
to do something--

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.994
it can actually have a higher
mutation rate than a large

00:11:59.994 --> 00:12:00.470
genome.
 

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.061
A small genome is small enough
so that the probability of a

00:12:05.061 --> 00:12:09.019
mutation at any one place in it
is fairly small.

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:12.697
A big genome is extremely
likely to have a bunch of

00:12:12.697 --> 00:12:13.580
mutations.
 

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.923
So there's a relationship
between the size of the genome

00:12:18.923 --> 00:12:23.879
and the amount of mutation that
can be tolerated.

00:12:23.879 --> 00:12:28.004
So Manfred Eigen--he's a German
guy who got a Nobel Prize for

00:12:28.004 --> 00:12:31.260
his work in biochemistry--
was thinking about the origin

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:32.341
of life,
and he said,

00:12:32.341 --> 00:12:35.142
"Well, the relevant
mutation rate is non-enzymatic

00:12:35.142 --> 00:12:35.918
replication.
 

00:12:35.918 --> 00:12:38.081
We're going to be making copies
of molecules,

00:12:38.081 --> 00:12:40.980
and at the origin there aren't
any enzymes anymore."

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.181
Okay?
 

00:12:41.181 --> 00:12:43.440
Enzymes are things that are
produced by living systems;

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.490
we don't have them.
 

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.398
We have to imagine ourselves
back into the situation where we

00:12:48.398 --> 00:12:51.330
don't have enzymes but we want
replication.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.245
And for that,
it turns out--he did the

00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:59.370
calculations--the maximum genome
size is about 100 nucleotides.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:04.421
So if we're dealing with
replication of a DNA-like or an

00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:08.980
RNA-like molecule,
you can only get up to a genome

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:14.325
of about 30 amino acids with the
kinds of mutation rates you get

00:13:14.325 --> 00:13:17.210
with non-enzymatic replication.
 

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:20.370
Well that's much,
much too small for an enzyme.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:22.870
You're not going to get an
enzyme out of that.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.326
Anything bigger than that,
you need to make the

00:13:25.326 --> 00:13:28.210
replication more accurate,
and in order to make it more

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:29.918
accurate you need an enzyme.
 

00:13:29.918 --> 00:13:34.149
You need translating machinery
to take the genome and make it

00:13:34.149 --> 00:13:36.960
into that enzyme;
you need the enzyme then to be

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.460
working on making the genome
replicate accurately.

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:41.769
And that takes a lot more than
100 nucleotides;

00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:45.029
it takes more like 1000 to
10,000 nucleotides to construct

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:48.288
any of the things that we know
of now that can do that.

00:13:48.288 --> 00:13:51.335
And so you can't get enzymes
without a big genome,

00:13:51.335 --> 00:13:54.379
and you can't get a big genome
without enzymes.

00:13:54.379 --> 00:13:55.429
It's a catch-22.
 

00:13:55.429 --> 00:13:57.690
Where are you going to go?
 

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:02.529
So Eigen tried to cook up a way
out of this, and he called it

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:03.658
hypercycles.
 

00:14:03.658 --> 00:14:07.278
And the word hyper
immediately makes you think of

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:10.240
something that's almost
quasi-metaphysical.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.350
It's nothing complicated.
 

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.259
Okay?
 

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:16.240
Here's what a hypercycle is.
 

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.990
Each one of these little things
here is a chemical reaction,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:23.440
and this little loop that I'm
pointing at,

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:27.399
where B is making something
that's making more B,

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:31.006
indicates that B is actually
capable of making more of

00:14:31.006 --> 00:14:33.956
itself;
it's a chemical reaction that

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:35.970
can make more of itself.
 

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.440
And there are a lot of such
chemical reactions.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.845
Often, in a chemical reaction,
you'll get product out of one

00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:45.019
side, plus some other stuff
that's like what you started

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:45.538
with.
 

00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:49.404
And this big dark arrow here
indicates that some of what B

00:14:49.404 --> 00:14:51.980
makes is actually a precursor
for C.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.258
So C needs something that B is
making, and it takes it and

00:14:56.258 --> 00:15:00.086
makes more of itself,
and then it ships something on

00:15:00.086 --> 00:15:03.090
that D needs to make more of
itself;

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.576
and D takes that and makes more
of itself and ships something on

00:15:06.576 --> 00:15:07.960
that makes A;
etcetera.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.028
Okay?
 

00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:13.943
So if you can set up--it's
called a hypercycle because it's

00:15:13.943 --> 00:15:16.909
a cycle with cycles inside of
it;

00:15:16.909 --> 00:15:19.450
it's a cycle of cycles.
 

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.136
The rate at which any one of
these can replicate increases

00:15:23.136 --> 00:15:26.825
with the amount of product
that's being given to it by any

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:27.990
of the others.
 

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:33.014
And that means that B can make
more B if it's getting more from

00:15:33.014 --> 00:15:35.279
A;
C can make more C if it's

00:15:35.279 --> 00:15:36.908
getting more from B.
 

00:15:36.908 --> 00:15:40.212
That means that in order to
function, the elements have to

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:41.720
cooperate for substrate.
 

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:43.399
They can't compete for
substrate.

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:46.750
They have to take what they
need and pass some on.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.715
And if this is then going to
get refined and become more

00:15:51.715 --> 00:15:55.447
sophisticated,
and perhaps get to the point

00:15:55.447 --> 00:15:59.610
where it acquires an information
molecule like DNA,

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:04.269
then it has to competitively
exclude other such systems.

00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:08.082
You could imagine a surface at
a hot thermal vent,

00:16:08.082 --> 00:16:11.663
3.5 billion years ago,
with many different such

00:16:11.663 --> 00:16:15.052
things;
a high degree of variation in

00:16:15.052 --> 00:16:19.068
just tiny little micro,
local chemical reaction

00:16:19.068 --> 00:16:20.028
systems.
 

00:16:20.028 --> 00:16:25.830
And if this is ever going to
bootstrap life and get underway,

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.264
then it has to be isolated in a
compartment and start competing

00:16:29.264 --> 00:16:32.994
with other such systems,
because only then will natural

00:16:32.994 --> 00:16:34.408
selection kick in.
 

00:16:34.408 --> 00:16:36.029
There is a problem with this
kind of thing.

00:16:36.029 --> 00:16:38.673
It's just sitting there in its
happy, hot thermal vent,

00:16:38.673 --> 00:16:41.220
taking its chemical energy out
of the environment.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:44.668
And it's open,
it's an open system.

00:16:44.668 --> 00:16:46.779
A selfish mutant could invade
and destroy it.

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:49.841
Somebody could come in,
who was say an alternate

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:52.643
version of C,
and take stuff from B and make

00:16:52.643 --> 00:16:55.769
a lot more C,
but not ship anything on to D;

00:16:55.769 --> 00:16:57.529
it could make a lot more C.
 

00:16:57.529 --> 00:16:59.950
That would essentially be a
selfish act.

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:00.395
Okay?
 

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:03.879
That means taking but not
giving back.

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:06.980
And in this system here,
an altruistic mutant won't

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.722
spread;
and altruistic means

00:17:08.722 --> 00:17:10.390
taking some and passing enough
along.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.383
So if this thing is open,
and it's not isolated from the

00:17:13.383 --> 00:17:15.979
environment,
any one of these steps in the

00:17:15.979 --> 00:17:19.844
hypercycle could be invaded by a
chemical alternative that would

00:17:19.844 --> 00:17:21.440
destroy the hypercycle.
 

00:17:26.529 --> 00:17:31.130
So these things are a model.
 

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.068
Okay?
 

00:17:32.068 --> 00:17:34.009
We're not saying that this is
what actually happened,

00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:36.709
but it is a model of how a
small group of cooperating

00:17:36.709 --> 00:17:42.000
molecules might have evolved,
before there was a genetic code.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.430
If we could get them to be
sufficiently complex,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.509
then they would start competing
with each other,

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:52.259
and then, at a certain point in
the complexity,

00:17:52.259 --> 00:17:56.314
they might invent genes and
have a competitive upper hand by

00:17:56.314 --> 00:18:00.848
then being able to transmit the
information on what was working.

00:18:00.848 --> 00:18:03.858
So that would certainly give
them an upper hand in

00:18:03.858 --> 00:18:04.720
competition.
 

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.854
And they would solve Eigen's
paradox, because each one has a

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.936
small genome,
but in sum they would add up to

00:18:11.936 --> 00:18:14.460
the information in a big genome.
 

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.271
So if you could somehow
stabilize these small

00:18:17.271 --> 00:18:21.106
competitive systems so that they
had internal cooperation but

00:18:21.106 --> 00:18:23.920
they were competing between
themselves,

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.368
you could get life going.
 

00:18:26.368 --> 00:18:31.186
So one way out of this problem
of the invasion of mutants is to

00:18:31.186 --> 00:18:34.140
actually put them into
compartments.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:34.410
Okay?
 

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:37.380
So you actually have to get the
chemical reaction system

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.808
isolated inside something like a
membrane;

00:18:39.808 --> 00:18:44.098
and that means it's a local
group.

00:18:44.098 --> 00:18:47.160
Will, are you finding certain
things here resonating?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.906
Will's a political scientist,
and he's interested in the

00:18:50.906 --> 00:18:54.994
interaction between cooperation
within groups and competition

00:18:54.994 --> 00:18:56.288
between groups.
 

00:18:56.288 --> 00:18:58.731
Those basic ideas,
that actually resonate in

00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:01.970
economics and political science,
are there in evolutionary

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.298
biology, right at the origin of
life.

00:19:04.298 --> 00:19:06.854
In order to get this going,
in order to get the whole

00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:09.983
process going,
basically what you need to do

00:19:09.983 --> 00:19:12.990
is isolate one of those
hypercycles,

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.634
let it grow,
have some kind of division

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:17.702
going on,
with some inheritance,

00:19:17.702 --> 00:19:20.952
and then have a mutation that's
going to improve one of the

00:19:20.952 --> 00:19:22.700
descendents,
so that this one,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.078
that has a better hypercycle,
can out-compete that one.

00:19:26.078 --> 00:19:28.828
Once you get that process
going, then you're going to

00:19:28.828 --> 00:19:31.048
retain cooperation within
compartments,

00:19:31.048 --> 00:19:33.025
you're going to increase
competition between

00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:35.917
compartments,
and natural selection can take

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:40.019
off and start to produce the
very early primitive cells.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:45.480
That's not so easy.
 

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.358
You got to get the
compartments,

00:19:47.358 --> 00:19:50.328
and there's some issues about
the compartments.

00:19:50.328 --> 00:19:52.840
You need them so that you can
keep the cooperators on the

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.352
inside and you can put the
parasites and the defectors on

00:19:55.352 --> 00:19:57.539
the outside;
so you can keep the guys that

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:00.176
you like and you want to work
with in there with you,

00:20:00.176 --> 00:20:02.509
and you can tell the other guys
to go away.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:05.766
What this does,
it's associating cause with

00:20:05.766 --> 00:20:08.881
effect strongly,
in the sense that if you're

00:20:08.881 --> 00:20:12.467
cooperating and you are shipping
your product on to the next

00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:15.934
member of the hypercycle,
that actually is an effect

00:20:15.934 --> 00:20:19.541
that's retained within the
system and then comes back to

00:20:19.541 --> 00:20:20.328
help you.
 

00:20:20.328 --> 00:20:22.116
If it's open,
you have no guarantee it's

00:20:22.116 --> 00:20:23.630
going to come back to help you.
 

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:26.230
So there's no guarantee of
reciprocity.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.493
But if you can contain the
cycle, then reciprocity is going

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:34.759
to occur because the cycle is
shielded from the outside.

00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:37.953
And it means that all of the
elements in the cycle have a

00:20:37.953 --> 00:20:40.750
common stake in the success of
the compartment.

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:43.769
They are all in the same boat;
they're all in it together.

00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:46.948
If they get better at what they
do, together,

00:20:46.948 --> 00:20:49.692
by cooperation,
they will improve their

00:20:49.692 --> 00:20:54.098
competition with the other
similar things on the outside.

00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:59.529
Now, we don't know where the
long-chain fatty acids came

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:00.220
from.
 

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.900
So I'm just going to pull them
out of the air;

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:05.869
we're back in Greek comedy,
deus ex machina--a machine

00:21:05.869 --> 00:21:10.289
lowers a god onto the stage and
he gives us long-chain fatty

00:21:10.289 --> 00:21:11.038
acids.
 

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:12.930
So we have our long-chain fatty
acids;

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.028
and, in fact,
we have a special kind.

00:21:15.028 --> 00:21:20.000
They've got a hydrophilic end
and a hydrophobic end.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.778
There's a b-o missing there;
that's hydrophobic.

00:21:23.778 --> 00:21:26.818
So one end likes water and one
end hates water.

00:21:26.818 --> 00:21:30.258
And if you do that,
if you make those things and

00:21:30.258 --> 00:21:33.769
you throw them into water--so
you have an aqueous

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:36.548
solution--this is what you'll
get.

00:21:36.548 --> 00:21:41.483
These are things which are
either micelles or primitive

00:21:41.483 --> 00:21:45.779
little spheroids or sometimes
linear things,

00:21:45.779 --> 00:21:48.880
that actually start looking
pretty much like a biological

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:49.490
membrane.
 

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.779
The fatty tails are sticking in
and associating with each other,

00:21:52.779 --> 00:21:56.807
and the hydrophilic parts are
sticking out and associating

00:21:56.807 --> 00:22:00.269
with all of those nice charged
water molecules.

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:04.048
Well, make a mixture of those
things,

00:22:04.048 --> 00:22:06.880
and then put in a surface--so
you have either the water

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.028
surface or you have a mineral
surface--

00:22:09.028 --> 00:22:11.259
and this is what naturally
happens.

00:22:11.259 --> 00:22:15.007
This is called abstriction;
you will get a little bump

00:22:15.007 --> 00:22:15.630
forming.
 

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.358
We're talking about stuff
that's there for free,

00:22:19.358 --> 00:22:22.025
in the sense that you don't
have to have any natural

00:22:22.025 --> 00:22:24.220
selection going on to give this
to you,

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.288
in the chemical structures.
 

00:22:27.288 --> 00:22:29.909
These things,
once you get them,

00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:32.358
will do this spontaneously.
 

00:22:32.358 --> 00:22:32.557
Okay?
 

00:22:32.557 --> 00:22:34.410
So you can get something like
this happening--

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.894
this is a nice little sphere
that's starting to bulge up off

00:22:37.894 --> 00:22:41.496
the surface--
and if you make them big

00:22:41.496 --> 00:22:44.440
enough, they will divide.
 

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.645
So they will grow and they'll
actually kind of start pulsing

00:22:47.645 --> 00:22:50.308
around a little bit,
just from Brownian motion.

00:22:50.308 --> 00:22:54.492
And if you get these little
spheroids, that are lipid

00:22:54.492 --> 00:22:59.240
bilayers, up to a certain size
they will actually divide.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.462
So you can see that it might
not actually have been necessary

00:23:03.462 --> 00:23:07.969
for natural selection to arrange
the first replication events for

00:23:07.969 --> 00:23:09.798
cellular compartments.
 

00:23:09.798 --> 00:23:13.604
That might have been something
that was just happening

00:23:13.604 --> 00:23:16.834
physically and chemically,
so that part of the

00:23:16.834 --> 00:23:19.490
bootstrapping was there for
free.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.067
Making it efficient,
making it good,

00:23:21.067 --> 00:23:22.871
making it precise,
making it complicated,

00:23:22.871 --> 00:23:25.960
that's a whole 'nother story;
that took a lot of evolution.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.038
But just that very simple
initial step of having a sphere

00:23:30.038 --> 00:23:33.900
of a bilipid membrane that had a
hypercycle in it--

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:37.009
maybe one in each compartment
that would then divide--

00:23:37.009 --> 00:23:40.558
that was probably there for
free.

00:23:40.558 --> 00:23:44.387
Now, if you want to make it
grow, then one of the things you

00:23:44.387 --> 00:23:48.022
want to put inside it is a
hypercycle that will make more

00:23:48.022 --> 00:23:51.857
membrane building blocks,
because that will just make the

00:23:51.857 --> 00:23:52.588
thing grow.
 

00:23:52.588 --> 00:23:57.182
So perhaps that was actually
the kind of chemical reaction

00:23:57.182 --> 00:24:02.578
that was going on in some of the
early semi-cells or proto-cells;

00:24:02.578 --> 00:24:07.509
they were making the building
blocks of lipid bilayers.

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:09.917
However, then you've got a
problem of how to get the

00:24:09.917 --> 00:24:12.798
different substrates that you
need in through the membrane;

00:24:12.798 --> 00:24:15.569
that's the problem of membrane
transport.

00:24:15.569 --> 00:24:16.420
You've got to have the membrane.
 

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.781
You've got to isolate your
reactions so that they can be

00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:24.670
cooperative and not
de-stabilized by parasites.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:27.667
But once you've isolated them,
then you have the problem of

00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:30.150
moving things in and out through
the membrane.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:33.848
So there's got to be a period,
back at the origin of life,

00:24:33.848 --> 00:24:37.440
during which membrane
properties can evolve,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.461
and that in a replicating
entity that's not yet fully cut

00:24:41.461 --> 00:24:43.400
off from its environment.
 

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.337
And the solution to that,
one possible solution is a

00:24:46.337 --> 00:24:47.029
semi-cell.
 

00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:50.887
That would be you make a cup on
the surface of water,

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:55.413
or on the surface of a mineral,
and you don't completely close

00:24:55.413 --> 00:24:56.750
the perimeter.
 

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.065
So the thing's kind of leaky;
stuff can go in and out of the

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:01.190
edges of the cup.
 

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:02.730
And that will solve the problem.
 

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.028
Okay?
 

00:25:03.028 --> 00:25:06.502
It allows a partial openness,
it gives you a certain degree

00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:08.960
of control over who comes in and
out,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.548
and that might've helped to
adjust these early semi-cells.

00:25:13.548 --> 00:25:16.858
If you want to have a look at a
fairly recent article--

00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:19.977
this is now five years
old--Rasmussen was talking about

00:25:19.977 --> 00:25:23.730
transitions from non-living to
living matter in Science.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.184
And then this would be a good
way, in Web of Science,

00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:28.308
to go and trace the more recent
literature.

00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:30.961
They will all--all the more
recent articles will almost

00:25:30.961 --> 00:25:34.946
certainly cite this one;
and then it also cites you back

00:25:34.946 --> 00:25:39.490
all the way to the Miller-Urey
experiments in 1953.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:43.952
So there's really growing
interest in how a simple life

00:25:43.952 --> 00:25:47.259
form could be synthesized in the
lab,

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.906
and there is a desire to see
whether or not we can understand

00:25:51.906 --> 00:25:56.478
the origin of life well enough
so that we can make alternate

00:25:56.478 --> 00:25:59.268
forms of life,
so that we can make

00:25:59.268 --> 00:26:02.740
self-replicating and
self-repairing nanomachines.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:05.578
And Drew Endy,
up at MIT, runs an

00:26:05.578 --> 00:26:10.371
international competition every
year where bright young

00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:15.429
molecular geneticists and
microbiologists get together and

00:26:15.429 --> 00:26:19.598
they try to engineer biological
machines.

00:26:19.598 --> 00:26:22.068
And the point of the
competition is to try to make

00:26:22.068 --> 00:26:24.640
the most complex and
sophisticated little biological

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.900
machine that you can.
 

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.243
And he's got funding from MIT
to bring these people from all

00:26:28.243 --> 00:26:28.920
over the world.
 

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.484
So every year there's an
international competition and a

00:26:31.484 --> 00:26:34.328
team comes in from Beijing and a
team comes in from Paris,

00:26:34.328 --> 00:26:37.858
and if Yale puts one together,
a team goes up from Yale,

00:26:37.858 --> 00:26:40.390
and they all play with their
biological machines,

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.630
which are at the scale of
viruses and bacteria.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:48.980
So out of this kind of creative
play,

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:52.270
we may actually learn a lot,
that then applies back to the

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:56.075
real origin of life,
rather than the geeky

00:26:56.075 --> 00:27:01.941
post-modern nanomachine,
so I see some hope in that kind

00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:03.838
of playful research.
 

00:27:03.838 --> 00:27:10.125
Okay, now I will wave my hands
and a miracle occurs and it's

00:27:10.125 --> 00:27:13.960
later on in the evolution of
life.

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:19.606
We're now going to discuss the
prokaryotic/eukaryotic

00:27:19.606 --> 00:27:21.019
transition.
 

00:27:21.019 --> 00:27:26.099
And the prokaryotic/eukaryotic
transition is thought to be a

00:27:26.099 --> 00:27:31.180
major transition because it
contains a significant change in

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:34.279
the transmission of information.
 

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:39.984
Every major transition in the
evolution of life has consisted

00:27:39.984 --> 00:27:45.785
either of a difference in the
way that genetic information was

00:27:45.785 --> 00:27:50.348
transmitted and/or in the unit
of selection;

00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:53.578
a thing that was actually
evolving.

00:27:53.578 --> 00:27:56.890
So both of those things are
going on here.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.259
What's going on in the
transition from the prokaryotes,

00:27:59.259 --> 00:28:01.798
up here, to the eukaryotes,
down here,

00:28:01.798 --> 00:28:06.862
is--one thing that's going
on--is that you're going from an

00:28:06.862 --> 00:28:09.080
organism,
like a bacterium,

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.868
that has a single circular
chromosome anchored to a cell

00:28:12.868 --> 00:28:15.801
wall,
to an organism that has a

00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:19.778
nucleus within which the
chromosomes are--

00:28:19.778 --> 00:28:24.618
there are then often multiple
chromosomes inside the nucleus,

00:28:24.618 --> 00:28:30.140
plus organelles that are out in
the cytoplasm,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:35.214
plus a lot of cell structure
that's simply not present in the

00:28:35.214 --> 00:28:36.400
prokaryotes.
 

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.108
So one of the things that you
have is an organizing center,

00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:45.980
out of which actin filaments
will grow, and these are used in

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:47.930
meiosis and mitosis.
 

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:51.381
And associated with that
organizing center is a little

00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:55.028
circular chromosome which is
actually thought to indicate

00:28:55.028 --> 00:28:58.608
that this was originally an
independent bacterium,

00:28:58.608 --> 00:29:02.625
and that these actin filaments
are evolutionary homologous with

00:29:02.625 --> 00:29:04.180
a bacterial flagellum.
 

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.376
You have got vacuoles,
you've got endoplasmic

00:29:10.376 --> 00:29:12.680
reticulum;
all kinds of stuff.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.390
And all eukaryotes,
if they have a cilium,

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:21.960
they have a characteristic 9 2
structure,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.671
in the cilium,
and this is thought to have

00:29:24.671 --> 00:29:28.309
been constructed from multiple
bacterial precursors,

00:29:28.309 --> 00:29:29.410
and so forth.
 

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:31.390
So you've got compartments
forming,

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:35.076
you've got organelles,
and you've got a difference in

00:29:35.076 --> 00:29:39.045
the way that genetic information
is compartmentalized and

00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:40.180
transmitted.
 

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.520
So the prokaryotes have a rigid
outer cell wall,

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.509
they have a circular chromosome
attached to the cell wall;

00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:49.160
and importantly the transcribed
mRNA is translated directly.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.220
You can see that here.
 

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.433
You can see the mRNA coming off
of the DNA helix,

00:29:54.433 --> 00:29:57.714
and you can see little
ribosomes here chunking out

00:29:57.714 --> 00:30:01.130
protein, that are these little
squiggly things;

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:04.618
whereas down here,
that process is being done at

00:30:04.618 --> 00:30:08.032
the endoplasmic reticulum,
and it's not direct,

00:30:08.032 --> 00:30:09.368
it's indirect.
 

00:30:09.368 --> 00:30:12.259
In the eukaryotes there's an
internal cytoskeleton.

00:30:12.259 --> 00:30:16.803
You've got lots of little micro
environments that are giving you

00:30:16.803 --> 00:30:21.420
the opportunity to create local
industry within the cytoplasm.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.171
There are several linear
chromosomes, inside a nuclear

00:30:25.171 --> 00:30:27.577
envelope;
transcription and translation

00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:30.598
are separated;
and there are organelles.

00:30:30.598 --> 00:30:33.338
And, with eukaryotes,
you get meiosis.

00:30:33.338 --> 00:30:37.155
So you get a precise and
organized way of making

00:30:37.155 --> 00:30:41.460
genetically different offspring
in each generation.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.759
Now, in order to go from
prokaryote to eukaryote,

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:47.029
you got to lose your cell wall.
 

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:50.058
And that's a real issue,
because the cell wall,

00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:52.252
in a bacterium,
is protecting it from swelling

00:30:52.252 --> 00:30:55.630
up and bursting like a balloon,
due to osmotic pressure.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.278
So the bacterium is using a
rigid cell wall to protect

00:31:00.278 --> 00:31:03.259
itself from the influx of water.
 

00:31:03.259 --> 00:31:06.587
And in order to do that,
in order to lose the cell wall,

00:31:06.587 --> 00:31:09.492
you need something to stabilize
it on the inside,

00:31:09.492 --> 00:31:11.430
and that's the cytoskeleton.
 

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.138
So the cytoskeleton is really
an extremely important

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:16.529
morphological invention in this
transition.

00:31:16.529 --> 00:31:17.809
Student:  Professor.
 

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:18.680
Prof: Yep?
 

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:22.160
Student:  How does this
view connect with the fact that

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:25.868
cytoskeleton elements have been
discovered in bacteria as well?

00:31:25.868 --> 00:31:29.578
Also cytoskeleton elements are
present in bacteria.

00:31:29.578 --> 00:31:32.521
Prof: Well you would
need to have cytoskeleton

00:31:32.521 --> 00:31:34.900
elements in the precursor,
wouldn't you?

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.011
You couldn't make the
transition unless they were

00:31:38.011 --> 00:31:39.048
already there.
 

00:31:39.048 --> 00:31:40.643
If you made the transition
without them,

00:31:40.643 --> 00:31:41.460
you would blow up.
 

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.654
So I'm not surprised that there
are cytoskeletal elements in

00:31:44.654 --> 00:31:45.250
bacteria.
 

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:50.848
Okay, and remember,
it's 3 billion years later.

00:31:50.848 --> 00:31:55.308
So a lot of stuff could've gone
on, in the bacteria.

00:31:55.308 --> 00:31:58.605
I think that what you're on to
actually is an interesting

00:31:58.605 --> 00:32:02.255
system to see whether or not you
could actually do experimental

00:32:02.255 --> 00:32:03.078
evolution.
 

00:32:03.078 --> 00:32:05.369
What is the state of the cell
wall in this bacteria?

00:32:05.369 --> 00:32:06.380
Do you know?
 

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.670
Student: 
&gt;

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:08.858
Prof: They don't have a
cell wall.

00:32:08.858 --> 00:32:09.778
Student:  They have a
normal cell wall.

00:32:09.778 --> 00:32:12.098
Prof: They have a normal
cell wall.

00:32:12.098 --> 00:32:15.532
If this idea is correct,
then of course it should be

00:32:15.532 --> 00:32:19.573
possible--it might take a long
time--to experimentally select

00:32:19.573 --> 00:32:21.930
them, to lose their cell walls.
 

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:25.429
But in order to do so,
they would probably have to

00:32:25.429 --> 00:32:28.429
organize their fibrils,
their cytoskeleton,

00:32:28.429 --> 00:32:32.000
in a very precise way before
they could do it.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.330
Just having them--they're
probably using it for some other

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:34.700
reason.
 

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.347
Student: They
actually--some of cytoskeleton

00:32:37.347 --> 00:32:39.307
is thought to re-mediate,
or regulate,

00:32:39.307 --> 00:32:40.578
cell wall synthesis.
 

00:32:40.578 --> 00:32:42.140
Prof: Is thought to
re-mediate--

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.068
Student:  Thought to
regulate cell wall synthesis.

00:32:45.068 --> 00:32:47.038
Prof: I can't hear the
last part of that.

00:32:47.038 --> 00:32:50.130
Student:  Is thought to
regulate cell wall synthesis.

00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:51.250
Prof: Cell wall
synthesis.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.910
Some of the cytoskeleton is
actually involved in cell wall

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:54.470
synthesis.
 

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.670
So that would suggest that it
was there for a long time.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.368
That is actually how evolution
works;

00:33:02.368 --> 00:33:04.990
it invents things for one
purpose, and then takes

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:06.740
advantage of them for another.
 

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.509
So what you're telling me is
actually that this scenario now

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:11.528
has all kinds of supporting
information,

00:33:11.528 --> 00:33:15.759
because the bacteria probably
had evolved for a long time,

00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:18.450
using the cytoskeleton for
another purpose.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.934
But then, having gotten it,
they were in a position to use

00:33:21.934 --> 00:33:25.358
it to keep from blowing up,
if they got rid of their cell

00:33:25.358 --> 00:33:25.910
wall.
 

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:28.320
But they did have to get rid of
their cell wall to become a

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:28.819
eukaryote.
 

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:29.759
Okay?
 

00:33:33.058 --> 00:33:35.967
By the way, I definitely accept
the fact that I don't know

00:33:35.967 --> 00:33:36.630
everything.
 

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:41.838
So I appreciate that.
 

00:33:41.838 --> 00:33:45.740
Now if you put your DNA into a
nucleus,

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.308
and you no longer have it as a
single circular chromosome,

00:33:50.308 --> 00:33:57.580
then it is possible that
without having to attach it to a

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:01.357
cell wall,
it might make it easier to make

00:34:01.357 --> 00:34:02.838
multiple chromosomes.
 

00:34:02.838 --> 00:34:05.374
And you get a big advantage
from that in terms of how big a

00:34:05.374 --> 00:34:07.875
genome you can have,
because you can then start

00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:10.567
replication in parallel,
at multiple points,

00:34:10.567 --> 00:34:14.221
rather than going around a
single circular chromosome to do

00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:14.599
it.
 

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:18.152
And that means that there
really would be no upper limit

00:34:18.152 --> 00:34:19.250
on genome size.
 

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:23.061
If you can make 100 small
chromosomes and start them all

00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:25.557
off at the same time,
in replication,

00:34:25.557 --> 00:34:29.510
you'll get through the
replication step very quickly.

00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:32.829
So there's an issue about the
origin of chromosomes.

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:35.438
That's actually a major
transition in the sense of how

00:34:35.438 --> 00:34:37.210
is the genetic material
organized

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.340
On the one hand there's this
replication advantage.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:44.949
Okay?
 

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:49.873
So you can make copies a lot
faster if you do it in parallel,

00:34:49.873 --> 00:34:52.581
in small pieces,
than in sequence,

00:34:52.581 --> 00:34:54.059
in big pieces.
 

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:58.260
And so that would be a cost of
having a bigger chromosome.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.230
You might want to have a
chromosome of intermediate size.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:05.518
And if it's taking an
interaction between two or more

00:35:05.518 --> 00:35:08.681
genes to produce either an
organism or to produce a

00:35:08.681 --> 00:35:12.349
biochemical reaction system that
has a certain ratio,

00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:15.340
that is well balanced in terms
of product,

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:18.791
then linking the genes that are
involved in that ensures that

00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:21.610
they'll both be found in all of
the offspring,

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.610
and that's a benefit of making
a bigger chromosome.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.094
So there would be a tendency
for the genome to agglutinate,

00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:30.440
if this were the only thing
going on.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.288
But it's balanced by this cost;
this benefit is balanced by

00:35:33.288 --> 00:35:33.849
that cost.
 

00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:35.489
And I'm sure there are other
things as well;

00:35:35.489 --> 00:35:38.469
I'm sure you can probably think
of some.

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:43.782
Now once you make chromosomes
and you synchronize their

00:35:43.782 --> 00:35:46.675
replication,
then essentially what you've

00:35:46.675 --> 00:35:49.610
done is you have eliminated the
competition of the genes.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.548
Because by putting the genes
onto a chromosome,

00:35:52.548 --> 00:35:55.170
you've put them all into the
same boat.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.293
You're no longer getting a
situation where one gene might

00:35:58.293 --> 00:36:01.250
be replicating at a higher rate
than another gene,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:05.423
which would lead to unbalanced
biochemistry and unbalanced

00:36:05.423 --> 00:36:06.449
development.
 

00:36:06.449 --> 00:36:09.269
So you've given them a stake in
the same process,

00:36:09.269 --> 00:36:12.503
and that process is the
replication of the chromosome on

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:14.090
which they are sitting.
 

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:18.231
So particularly for the genes
that were involved in

00:36:18.231 --> 00:36:22.621
replication, if they needed to
cooperate to replicate,

00:36:22.621 --> 00:36:26.349
this would be an important
consideration.

00:36:26.349 --> 00:36:30.721
Now if you've got a primordial
cell that has a lot of reactions

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:33.423
going on in it,
that are being controlled by

00:36:33.423 --> 00:36:35.730
genes that are all on separate
chromosomes,

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:40.594
and if those chromosomes are
not being divided evenly at

00:36:40.594 --> 00:36:43.927
mitosis and meiosis,
then it's possible that all

00:36:43.927 --> 00:36:46.619
those reaction systems are going
to get out of balance.

00:36:46.619 --> 00:36:46.985
Okay?
 

00:36:46.985 --> 00:36:51.380
And so if you've got unlinked
genes with products that need a

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.302
certain ratio,
then getting them onto the same

00:36:54.302 --> 00:36:56.679
chromosome and regulating them
all together,

00:36:56.679 --> 00:37:01.829
gives you a big advantage over
your competitors,

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:02.719
at that point.
 

00:37:02.719 --> 00:37:04.119
I'm sorry this is running off.
 

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:07.719
I think it shows up on your
printouts.

00:37:07.719 --> 00:37:10.583
Okay, now the other thing
that's going on in the

00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:14.298
eukaryotes is they've got these
symbiotic organelles that were

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:17.650
originally independent bacteria:
the mitochondria,

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.309
the chloroplasts,
and possibly the spindle

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:22.380
apparatus.
 

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:26.371
So one thing that we notice
when we look at the chloroplasts

00:37:26.371 --> 00:37:30.565
in the mitochondria is that the
chloroplasts have a much bigger

00:37:30.565 --> 00:37:34.202
genome than do the mitochondria,
and the mitochondrial genes

00:37:34.202 --> 00:37:35.880
have been transferred into the
nucleus.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:39.693
We can sequence the
mitochondria--we know that they

00:37:39.693 --> 00:37:42.440
were independent purple
bacteria--

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.400
and we can estimate from the
size of the genome of a purple

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:48.567
bacterium how much has now been
transferred into the eukaryotic

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:50.635
nucleus;
and we can see that a great

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:53.599
deal has been transferred into
the eukaryotic nucleus.

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:59.018
So one of the reasons to do
that is essentially efficiency.

00:37:59.018 --> 00:38:01.380
If you put those genes into the
nucleus,

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.090
you're just maintaining two
copies of them,

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.418
rather than thousands of copies
out in the population of

00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:09.019
mitochondria that are living in
the cell.

00:38:09.019 --> 00:38:12.340
Another is conflict resolution.
 

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.400
Basically you're cutting way
down on the opportunity for

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.610
different variants to exist in
mitochondrial processes.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.552
If you're constructing all of
the mitochondria out of

00:38:23.552 --> 00:38:26.610
essential elements that are in
your nuclear genome,

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:30.070
you've gotten control over
them, in a way,

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:33.530
and you are making them all
look the same,

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.382
rather than mutating and
possibly having the option of

00:38:37.382 --> 00:38:41.889
creating a runaway mitochondrial
cancer that would destroy your

00:38:41.889 --> 00:38:42.980
metabolism.
 

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.268
Now why not put all the genes
into the nuclear genome?

00:38:46.268 --> 00:38:48.440
Well there are a couple of
reasons.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.286
One is that the genetic code is
actually different in the

00:38:52.286 --> 00:38:56.545
mitochondria and in eukaryotes
and in the nuclear genome and in

00:38:56.545 --> 00:38:57.920
the chloroplast.
 

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:02.788
So the tRNA and ribosomal RNA
genes, the translation machinery

00:39:02.788 --> 00:39:06.139
had to be retained in the
mitochondrion;

00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:07.880
at least that much.
 

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:09.427
Now that explains the
mitochondrion,

00:39:09.427 --> 00:39:11.239
but it doesn't explain the
chloroplast.

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:14.952
It looks like the chloroplast
retains more genes because it

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:18.920
has to move macro molecules
through more layers of membrane.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.617
Remember, the world record on a
chloroplast is that it has four

00:39:22.617 --> 00:39:25.539
membranes around it,
and all chloroplasts have two

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:27.090
membranes around them.
 

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:30.115
So it's harder to move big
molecules through them,

00:39:30.115 --> 00:39:33.574
and so if you need them to make
the chloroplast function,

00:39:33.574 --> 00:39:36.170
you have to make more of them
locally.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:40.740
So that's probably one reason
for the retention of more genes

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:45.389
in the chloroplast genome than
in the mitochondrial genome.

00:39:45.389 --> 00:39:49.740
Do we think that the organelles
were originally slaves of the

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:51.409
things that ate them?
 

00:39:51.409 --> 00:39:54.244
Was it a relationship that
might have been like a farmer

00:39:54.244 --> 00:39:57.742
and livestock,
the way that corals harvest

00:39:57.742 --> 00:40:01.559
dinoflagellates,
that are helping them make

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:03.710
their carbonate skeletons?
 

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.860
Well, there's some evidence.
 

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:09.262
We can look at where are the
tapping proteins made that are

00:40:09.262 --> 00:40:12.300
inserted into the organelle
membranes?

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.619
And those are encoded in the
nucleus.

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:15.730
Okay?
 

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.639
And it looks like they evolve
from host proteins.

00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:23.215
So it looks like there have
been manipulative steps where

00:40:23.215 --> 00:40:27.239
the host was actually tapping in
to the symbiotic organelles;

00:40:27.239 --> 00:40:28.869
that's one piece of evidence.
 

00:40:28.869 --> 00:40:31.940
But there's also thought that
they may have been mutualists,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:35.730
and the excretory products of
one of them,

00:40:35.730 --> 00:40:39.530
which was a eubacterium,
it was making hydrogen and CO2.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:44.380
And the missing piece of this
sentence basically is that that

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:48.989
would then have been food for
the archaean ancestor of the

00:40:48.989 --> 00:40:50.849
eukaryotic nucleus.
 

00:40:50.849 --> 00:40:52.809
So they could have actually
been mutualists.

00:40:52.809 --> 00:40:55.318
So there is a slave hypothesis
and there's a mutualistic

00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:57.280
hypothesis, and that hasn't been
settled.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.969
Why not just have one;
why do plants need to have two?

00:41:03.969 --> 00:41:05.699
And if you look at their
ancestors,

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:08.737
you can see that purple
non-sulfur bacteria and

00:41:08.737 --> 00:41:11.233
cyanobacteria--
so those are the ancestors of

00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:14.150
mitochondria and chloroplasts--
they can do both;

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.000
they can both photosynthesize
and they can respire.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.322
However, the purple bacteria
can't photosynthesize when

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:24.356
there's oxygen,
and the cyanobacteria use the

00:41:24.356 --> 00:41:26.750
same machinery for both
functions,

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:30.820
and so that means that the host
cell would not be able to

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.599
separately control
photosynthesis and respiration;

00:41:34.599 --> 00:41:37.500
which one might want to
uncouple.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.992
And so it appears that
mitochondria lost photosynthesis

00:41:41.992 --> 00:41:46.320
and chloroplasts lost
respiration, in coming into the

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:47.070
cell.
 

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:49.690
So I won't run through all of
this;

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:50.860
you can read through it if you
want.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.027
Basically what's going on here
is the world record for

00:41:54.027 --> 00:41:56.300
membranes around a chloroplast
is 4;

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.900
it's in a dinoflagellate.
 

00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:02.126
And what's going on here is
that one thing eats

00:42:02.126 --> 00:42:05.213
cyanobacterium,
and that makes a chloroplast

00:42:05.213 --> 00:42:08.284
that has the outer membrane of a
cyanobacterium and the outer

00:42:08.284 --> 00:42:10.179
membrane of the cell that ate
it,

00:42:10.179 --> 00:42:12.590
wrapped around it;
so that makes two.

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.139
And then it happens two more
times.

00:42:15.139 --> 00:42:19.150
And so the world record for
this is in a dinoflagellate.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.940
Okay?
 

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:25.172
And it turns out that the
things that got eaten to make

00:42:25.172 --> 00:42:29.623
dinoflagellates had separated,
so that there were different

00:42:29.623 --> 00:42:32.219
kind of chloroplasts that got
eaten by different things,

00:42:32.219 --> 00:42:34.159
that both ended up making
dinoflagellates.

00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:36.119
And so it looks like,
in that sense,

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:38.360
dinoflagellates might be
polyphyletic.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:41.380
It's a complicated sequence
here.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:46.291
And you will notice in here
that you have got some

00:42:46.291 --> 00:42:49.599
interesting words:
rhodophytes;

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:53.780
photosynthetic stramenophiles;
haptophytes;

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:56.039
the dinoflagellates themselves.
 

00:42:56.039 --> 00:42:59.853
It would be worth doing a
Google Image search on those

00:42:59.853 --> 00:43:03.596
things, just to familiarize
yourself with this bit of

00:43:03.596 --> 00:43:05.539
Protistan biodiversity.
 

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:09.128
There are more things out
there, in the world,

00:43:09.128 --> 00:43:11.760
than our fantasies can imagine.
 

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:17.820
And these guys are specialists
in all kinds of weird genetics.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.980
So I just want to cue you to
that.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.000
We're not going to go--this
isn't a course in protistology,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.501
but there's been an awful lot
of interesting evolutionary

00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:32.130
biology that's gone on in these
single-celled creatures.

00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.820
So that's a dinoflagellate.
 

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.510
They're cool things.
 

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:45.235
They have a--it's kind of a bit
like a small algal cell sitting

00:43:45.235 --> 00:43:51.039
inside of a complicated glass
case.

00:43:51.039 --> 00:43:54.097
So there are some other key
events: origin of the genetic

00:43:54.097 --> 00:43:55.969
code;
origin of multicellularity;

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:00.079
origin of germline and soma;
origin of social groups;

00:44:00.079 --> 00:44:02.469
origin of language.
 

00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:06.594
It's a big topic,
and in each one of these steps

00:44:06.594 --> 00:44:11.159
there are several very important
things going on,

00:44:11.159 --> 00:44:13.960
and there are certain
similarities of the process in

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:15.389
each one of those steps.
 

00:44:15.389 --> 00:44:19.659
So I'd like to summarize those,
with a few principles that are

00:44:19.659 --> 00:44:20.429
involved.
 

00:44:20.429 --> 00:44:24.168
So one of the things that's
happening here is that there is

00:44:24.168 --> 00:44:27.197
a new level of selection,
there's a new level of

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:30.210
replication;
the hierarchy is growing.

00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:34.980
So you go from the hypercycle
into competing groups of

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:39.750
protocells, and those eventually
make a prokaryote.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:43.652
And then there are symbiotic
events, and you actually then

00:44:43.652 --> 00:44:47.690
have selection operating on a
eukaryotic cell that's got two

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.539
or three genomes in it.
 

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:52.152
And then in the process the
genetic material,

00:44:52.152 --> 00:44:55.418
of course, is also going
through its reorganization into

00:44:55.418 --> 00:44:56.369
chromosomes.
 

00:44:56.369 --> 00:44:59.389
And then after that,
you get multicellularity;

00:44:59.389 --> 00:45:03.474
you get cells that are probably
genetically almost identical,

00:45:03.474 --> 00:45:07.518
that are growing together;
you get division of labor

00:45:07.518 --> 00:45:08.630
within that.
 

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.550
So one of the things that
happens is that the babushka

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:18.380
doll, the number of levels in
the hierarchy grows.

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:21.786
When that new upper level
originates, then there's an

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:25.454
opportunity for functional
specialization and division of

00:45:25.454 --> 00:45:26.110
labor.
 

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:30.222
In the multicellular organism
we call this division of labor

00:45:30.222 --> 00:45:33.500
the origin of cell layers and
organ systems,

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.159
so that some cells make brains
and other cells make hearts;

00:45:36.159 --> 00:45:38.880
some do respiration,
some do excretion.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:42.480
That would be a multicellular
division of labor.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.018
In a social insect colony,
we would say that the queen has

00:45:45.018 --> 00:45:47.599
specialized on reproduction,
and then we have the different

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:49.070
castes that are doing things.
 

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:51.550
Some of them are cleaning up
the garbage in the colony;

00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:52.800
some of them are feeding the
queen;

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.840
some of them are foraging
outside.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.380
And you can see the analogy to
a human society as well.

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.239
So there's functional
specialization with division of

00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:02.679
labor.
 

00:46:02.679 --> 00:46:07.320
There is a change in the system
of information transmission.

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:11.409
So when you go from prokaryotes
to eukaryotes,

00:46:11.409 --> 00:46:13.650
you have to arrange for
information to be transmitted,

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:17.666
not only in the nuclear genome,
but also in the cytoplasmic

00:46:17.666 --> 00:46:18.360
genomes.
 

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:21.998
And then you have the evolution
of meiosis, and you have sexual

00:46:21.998 --> 00:46:24.856
reproduction;
which is a huge change in the

00:46:24.856 --> 00:46:27.039
way information is transmitted.
 

00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:30.635
Probably since the origin of
sex, the biggest- highest impact

00:46:30.635 --> 00:46:33.811
change in information
transmission has been the origin

00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:36.757
of language and culture,
which gives a method of

00:46:36.757 --> 00:46:39.750
transmitting information from
generation to generation,

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:45.179
that is independent of the DNA,
and allows the process to be

00:46:45.179 --> 00:46:49.690
going on in different directions
at two levels.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:53.380
Then often in the process of
forming this higher level of

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.061
replication,
you have a bunch of lower level

00:46:56.061 --> 00:46:59.389
units that are coming together
to make a higher level unit,

00:46:59.389 --> 00:47:01.949
and they need to cooperate to
do that properly,

00:47:01.949 --> 00:47:05.190
but they could be invaded by
selfish mutants,

00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.978
they could be de-stabilized,
and so there's a conflict

00:47:08.978 --> 00:47:09.550
issue.
 

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.989
And this conflict is sometimes
stabilized by selection for

00:47:13.989 --> 00:47:15.079
cooperation.
 

00:47:15.079 --> 00:47:18.811
You've heard me use several
times in this lecture a phrase

00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:22.673
like 'they're all in the same
boat' or 'they are all sharing

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:25.251
mutual interests',
as in the genes getting

00:47:25.251 --> 00:47:28.576
together on a chromosome,
or the chemical reactions

00:47:28.576 --> 00:47:31.800
coming together in a single
protocell.

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.070
Those are all principles of
conflict resolution,

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.820
because if you are in a tightly
spatially organized system,

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.097
where your own welfare depends
directly upon cooperation with

00:47:42.097 --> 00:47:45.570
another thing in that system,
and your system is in

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:47.780
competition with some outside
system,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.751
and the performance of your
system is actually a direct

00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:52.900
function of how cooperative you
are,

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:56.110
then there is strong selection
for integration,

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:57.250
within that group.
 

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.936
And it's thought that this is
the kind of thing that's going

00:48:00.936 --> 00:48:04.875
on when you have a key event in
the origin of a new higher level

00:48:04.875 --> 00:48:07.000
in the evolutionary hierarchy.
 

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.929
So those are some of the key
events in evolution.

00:48:09.929 --> 00:48:13.570
They are a rather abstract way
of looking at the history of

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.010
life.
 

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.038
And next time we're going to
look at major events in the

00:48:17.038 --> 00:48:20.057
geological theater,
and so the lecture next time is

00:48:20.057 --> 00:48:23.500
more for people who like
firecrackers on the 4th of July,

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.210
and the clash of meteorites.

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.033
Prof: So in Monday's
lecture we let something slip by

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:10.638
all of us without comment that
we probably should not have let

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.382
slip by,
and it's something I want to

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:14.390
focus on today.
 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.650
That is when we spelled out
Mill's harm principle I said,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.910
"Is everybody sure they
know what it means?"

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.210
Never mind whether you agree
with it or not,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.087
but whether you're sure that
you understand what he is

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:29.302
saying,
and we all agreed that at least

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:30.510
it was clear.
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.629
In fact, though,
it's ambiguous,

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.465
and the highlighted phrase is
the ambiguity I want to focus

00:00:39.465 --> 00:00:40.170
on.
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.357
At the end of that long
paragraph I read you when Mill

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:48.601
is saying,
"If you think something's

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.952
bad for somebody or that they
shouldn't do it,"

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:55.830
remember I gave you an example
of going to law school when I

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.130
don't think it's good for you.
 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.085
Mill says, "Those may be
good reasons for remonstrating

00:01:02.085 --> 00:01:03.859
with him,
or reasoning with him,

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.974
or persuading him,
or entreating him,

00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:09.950
but not for compelling him or
visiting him with any evil in

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.349
case he decides to do otherwise.
 

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:16.317
To justify that (I need to
justify forcing somebody to do

00:01:16.317 --> 00:01:20.144
something or prohibiting
somebody from doing something)

00:01:20.144 --> 00:01:24.111
the conduct from which it is
desired to deter him must be

00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:28.010
calculated to produce evil to
someone else."

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.290
"Must be calculated to
produce evil from someone

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.360
else."
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.976
And there are two issues raised
by that phrase that I really

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:42.280
want us to focus on with
laser-like intensity in today's

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.220
lecture.
 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.811
The one is signaled by the
passive voice in it,

00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:47.670
"must be calculated."
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.757
Well, that obviously puts on
the table, who does the

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:53.440
calculating, right?
 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.983
And secondly,
what does it mean,

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.470
calculated?
 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.438
It could mean calculated as in
intended.

00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:05.849
"I didn't intend to harm
you.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.079
There was no calculation to
harm you when I got

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.520
paralytically drunk behind the
wheel of a car,

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.722
and then I don't even remember
putting the keys in the wheel

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:16.699
and driving off.
 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.479
I didn't intend to harm
you," right?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:25.810
Or is it a third party
calculation?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.530
Again, then we get to the
question, by whom?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.639
Who's going to decide?
 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.050
Who's going to do the
calculating?

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.706
So what does calculated
actually mean,

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:38.370
and who is it that's going to
do the calculating?

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.919
Those are the things we're
going to zero in on today.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.223
And I thought the best way into
it was to consider some

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:46.098
examples.
 

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:50.054
And one I left you with on
Monday was, what about

00:02:50.054 --> 00:02:51.288
prostitution?
 

00:02:51.288 --> 00:02:55.390
This is what is sometimes
referred to as a so-called

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.919
victimless crime.
 

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:02.485
After all, the transaction
between a prostitute and a

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:07.729
client is a Pareto superior
transaction, right?

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.949
It's a voluntary market
transaction.

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:16.143
They wouldn't do it if it
didn't make both people better

00:03:16.143 --> 00:03:16.710
off.
 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.197
So should we just say from
Mill's point of view,

00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:24.740
"There's no harm here;
it truly is a victimless crime

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.566
and we shouldn't make things
criminal if they are

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.158
victimless?"
 

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:35.000
How many people think that
makes sense?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.770
About half.
 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.634
Who thinks it doesn't make
sense?

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:38.160
Nobody?
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.460
Yeah. Okay, so why?
 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.693
Why doesn't it make sense,
somebody who thinks it doesn't

00:03:45.693 --> 00:03:47.139
make sense?
 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.500
Over here?
 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.410
Why were you thinking it didn't
make sense?

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.949
 
 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:00.622
Student: Even though
it's victimless I think harming

00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:03.030
yourself has some sort of
implications,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.788
I think.
 

00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:07.180
Prof: So it's the
prostitute harming herself?

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.520
Student:  Sort of.
 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.116
I think there are some moral
implications in there that must

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:11.818
be dealt with.
 

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:13.042
Prof: Like what?
 

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:14.530
What kinds of implications?
 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.877
Student:  Besides just
harming--okay,

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:21.149
let me take that back,
harming yourself.

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.759
It might harm society in the
sense that it brings down

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.278
society's moral standards,
I guess.

00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:31.709
Prof: Okay,
it might harm society.

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:35.598
Mill's very clear that he wants
to reject the idea that there

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:39.502
are social rights,
so he wouldn't accept that,

00:04:39.502 --> 00:04:44.120
but I don't think you should
give up so quickly.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.367
Is there some other way of
articulating what you have in

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:49.670
mind there when you say harm
society?

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.759
What do you mean?
 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.374
If you unpack what does it mean
when you say,

00:04:55.374 --> 00:04:57.995
"harm society?"
 

00:04:57.995 --> 00:04:59.569
It's tricky.
 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.814
Anyone else want to have a go?
 

00:05:01.814 --> 00:05:03.610
Yeah, right behind you.
 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.305
Student:  I guess it
poses a negative externality on

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:07.560
society, and therefore...
 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.240
Prof: Okay,
and what is the negative

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.800
externality?
 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.810
Student: Well,
I guess in the case of

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.617
prostitution it could be the
objectification of women in this

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:15.040
case.
 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.199
Prof: Objectification of
women, okay.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:24.199
How would we say that's a harm
to society?

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:28.158
Maybe it would be--again,
Mill's going to reject the idea

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:31.269
that society has a right not to
be harmed.

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:35.990
How can it play out in a way
that doesn't involve making that

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:37.879
claim that society...?
 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:41.482
Student:  Well,
I guess you could say it poses

00:05:41.482 --> 00:05:45.569
a negative externality on the
individuals in the society by,

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:46.540
I guess...
 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.550
Prof: On women.
 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.300
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.550
Prof: On women.
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.940
It poses a negative externality
on women.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:55.160
It reinforces the set of
stereotypes and so on.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.218
Okay, so that might be one way
in which prostitution causes

00:06:00.218 --> 00:06:00.829
harm.
 

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:03.879
Any other ways? Yes, sir?
 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:06.672
Student:  It could also
be said that it has a negative

00:06:06.672 --> 00:06:09.000
externality because it
undermines family values.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.379
Prof: It undermines
family values.

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:14.163
Student:  Which would
then, in turn,

00:06:14.163 --> 00:06:15.990
hurt children and the future
generations.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.500
Prof: And that would,
in turn, hurt children.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:21.120
Yeah?
 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.831
Student:  Well,
I think it's difficult also to

00:06:23.831 --> 00:06:26.858
disconnect prostitution from
this sort of theoretical model

00:06:26.858 --> 00:06:29.050
from the actual model of
prostitution.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.180
I think when we put pimps,
and sexual slavery,

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.273
and that sort of thing in the
picture then the harm becomes

00:06:35.273 --> 00:06:38.259
far more real,
and it's questionable whether

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.416
people are voluntarily
participating in these

00:06:41.416 --> 00:06:43.569
transactions to begin with.
 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:46.016
Prof: Okay,
so if you're a really

00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:50.029
hardboiled Millian libertarian I
think slavery's not an issue.

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.329
Slaves are taken by force,
but selling yourself into

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:58.629
indentured servitude is not
obviously something--

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:02.560
would Mill say you should be
allowed to do that?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.129
 
 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:08.528
It's your choice.
 

00:07:08.528 --> 00:07:15.189
It's tricky because you're
really giving up your autonomy.

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:18.355
You'll see in politics,
we confront later in the

00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.086
course,
what do you do with an election

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:24.355
where a party runs,
as in Algeria in 1991 saying,

00:07:24.355 --> 00:07:27.976
"If elected we are going
to abolish democracy,"

00:07:27.976 --> 00:07:29.528
and they get elected.
 

00:07:29.528 --> 00:07:35.500
In that case the Algerian
military stepped in.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.723
If somebody says,
"I'm going to sell myself

00:07:38.723 --> 00:07:41.605
into servitude,"
it's a voluntary act,

00:07:41.605 --> 00:07:44.350
should we save them from
themselves?

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:50.519
That's a very tricky one,
but let's set those ones aside.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.672
And I think there would be
similar issues with suicide for

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:54.060
Mill.
 

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.779
Should you be allowed to stop
people committing suicide?

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:58.940
Those are very hard.
 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.766
I think they're separate,
though, from these issues about

00:08:02.766 --> 00:08:05.160
what we're calling
externalities.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.331
People are saying,
"Of course there are

00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:09.050
harmful effects of prostitution.
 

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.850
It harms women.
 

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.569
It undermines certain kinds of
moral codes.

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:20.319
What would Mill say in response
to that?

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:23.360
Yeah?
 

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.706
Student:  Well,
I think for Mill it really

00:08:25.706 --> 00:08:27.420
depends on the context of an
act.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.444
So you can be drunk at home,
but you can't be a policeman

00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:31.470
drunk on the job.
 

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.087
So if we look at prostitution
if you're working as a free

00:08:35.087 --> 00:08:36.855
agent,
sure, you can engage in

00:08:36.855 --> 00:08:39.195
prostitution,
but if you're a father and

00:08:39.195 --> 00:08:42.807
you're married then he should
probably view that as something

00:08:42.807 --> 00:08:43.529
not okay.
 

00:08:43.529 --> 00:08:47.835
So it really matters for him
what the context is of a certain

00:08:47.835 --> 00:08:48.840
transaction.
 

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.553
Prof: Okay,
I think that's right,

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:55.379
and you could imagine a more
refined version of the harm

00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:58.509
principle that tried to
incorporate that.

00:08:58.509 --> 00:09:01.344
I gave the example last time;
I think I said,

00:09:01.344 --> 00:09:05.241
"Mill would presumably be
completely comfortable without

00:09:05.241 --> 00:09:08.879
outlawing drunk driving and
punishing that activity,

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.668
but not punishing
drinking."

00:09:10.668 --> 00:09:14.668
So presumably the principle
would be some version of

00:09:14.668 --> 00:09:19.216
"interfere with human
conduct as little as possible to

00:09:19.216 --> 00:09:21.570
prevent harm,"
right?

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.217
So it's killing a gnat with a
sledgehammer to outlaw drinking

00:09:26.217 --> 00:09:29.240
just because some people drive
drunk.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.658
I think that's fair enough.
 

00:09:30.658 --> 00:09:34.399
But I think some of the people
who were saying allowing

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:38.692
prostitution has bigger negative
externalities wouldn't give up

00:09:38.692 --> 00:09:39.870
that quickly.
 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.871
Anyone who thinks we shouldn't
give up that quickly,

00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:46.620
that there's something else
here?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.110
 
 

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.668
Nobody?
 

00:09:51.668 --> 00:09:55.720
Maybe they would give up that
quickly.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.951
Okay, we'll leave that aside
for a minute and come back to

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:01.408
it.
 

00:10:01.408 --> 00:10:10.746
So if you're now bearing this
in mind go back and reread On

00:10:10.746 --> 00:10:12.889
Liberty.
 

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:17.207
I think what you'll come away
with is it's actually quite

00:10:17.207 --> 00:10:20.370
confusing just what Mill means
by harm.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.370
Because some harms,
he wants to say,

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.484
are trivial harms,
so the harm you suffer through

00:10:27.484 --> 00:10:31.941
not getting a place in college
in a competitive exam,

00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:32.970
right?
 

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:36.437
He's not going to allow that
harm ultimately to be

00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:37.428
dispositive.
 

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:42.518
He's going to allow that to be
outweighed by the benefits to

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:45.710
society of competitive
meritocracy.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:50.250
And remember our free trade
discussion last time.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:54.162
So some harms are more
significant than other harms and

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:57.928
some harms are outweighed by
utilitarian benefits.

00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:03.753
It seems like,
some of the time,

00:11:03.753 --> 00:11:09.187
if Mill's saying,
"Prohibition shouldn't be

00:11:09.187 --> 00:11:11.480
allowed,"
he's saying essentially,

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:16.370
"Unless I intend to do you
some harm.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.899
You might find it offensive
that I sit around drinking all

00:11:20.899 --> 00:11:23.918
day, but it's none of your
business.

00:11:23.918 --> 00:11:29.791
You might have family values
which say that if there are

00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:35.554
people out there who are
prostitutes, it undermines the

00:11:35.554 --> 00:11:36.730
family.
 

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:39.029
That's your family value,
thank you very much.

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:41.350
It's not my family value,"
right?

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.940
So you could take that view.
 

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:45.515
And after all,
if you think about the debate

00:11:45.515 --> 00:11:48.931
we've had in this country about
gay marriage over the past

00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:51.864
decade or so,
that's exactly the claim and

00:11:51.864 --> 00:11:53.519
the counterclaim,
right?

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.023
Some people say,
"There's no reason in the

00:11:56.023 --> 00:11:59.558
world that gay people should be
prevented from getting married.

00:11:59.558 --> 00:12:01.028
They're not hurting anybody
else."

00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:04.596
And then people say,
"Well, that undermines

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:07.710
traditional family values,"
right?

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:10.667
And the people who support gay
marriage say,

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.178
"Well, so what?
 

00:12:12.178 --> 00:12:14.267
Those are your traditional
family values,

00:12:14.267 --> 00:12:16.615
but they're not our traditional
family values,

00:12:16.615 --> 00:12:18.389
and why should yours...."
 

00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:20.460
This is, after all,
what Mill says,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.529
the tyranny of majority
opinion.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:25.340
So what? Right?
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.138
This is supposed to protect
individual freedom against it,

00:12:29.138 --> 00:12:32.537
so one person's traditional
family values is another

00:12:32.537 --> 00:12:35.269
person's tyranny of majority
opinion.

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:37.230
How are you going to resolve
that?

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.389
What mechanisms does Mill have
to resolve that?

00:12:41.389 --> 00:12:45.200
And I think you could read
On Liberty

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:50.327
 with a fine-tooth comb
and not come up with one,

00:12:50.327 --> 00:12:54.988
and so you could say,
"Well, so much the worse

00:12:54.988 --> 00:12:56.200
for Mill.
 

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.748
We thought we had this
wonderful rights-utility

00:12:59.748 --> 00:13:03.759
synthesis where all good things
would go together.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:05.899
We could respect individual
freedoms,

00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:10.629
and promote social utilitarian
efficiency based on science all

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:15.379
at the same time,
but actually it turns out to

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:19.379
all be resting on a hill of
sand,

00:13:19.379 --> 00:13:24.389
and the minute you walk on it
you start sinking."

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:29.402
And I think this is a good time
to go back to the point I made

00:13:29.402 --> 00:13:34.168
to you right at the beginning of
the course when I said you

00:13:34.168 --> 00:13:39.100
shouldn't be expecting the
silver bullet in this course.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.620
You shouldn't be expecting to
find the theory that answers all

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:44.879
your questions.
 

00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:49.037
What instead you're going to
find is particular insights that

00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:53.056
you can pick up and put into
your bag of tricks and move on

00:13:53.056 --> 00:13:53.678
with.
 

00:13:53.678 --> 00:13:56.580
Because I think it is,
at the end of the day,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.095
a good critique of Mill to say,
"There is no single

00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:04.057
definition of harm and there's
no good account of who makes the

00:14:04.057 --> 00:14:06.038
decisions about harm."
 

00:14:06.038 --> 00:14:10.306
And so to that extent his claim
at the beginning of On

00:14:10.306 --> 00:14:14.572
Liberty that there's one
simple principle and this is

00:14:14.572 --> 00:14:16.250
what it is, fails.
 

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:19.400
Nonetheless,
there are some important and

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.206
enduring insights here that I
think we're not going to want to

00:14:24.206 --> 00:14:25.308
let go of.
 

00:14:25.308 --> 00:14:31.543
One is, when you think about
all of the ways human beings

00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:34.621
interact,
and all of the things we do

00:14:34.621 --> 00:14:38.235
that cause us to have the
possibility of bumping into one

00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:41.821
another,
maybe it shouldn't be the case

00:14:41.821 --> 00:14:46.320
that there is a single
definition of harm because

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.942
different definitions of harm
are relevant to different types

00:14:51.942 --> 00:14:53.629
of situation.
 

00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:58.097
This is a little like the point
somebody here made that Mill

00:14:58.097 --> 00:15:00.899
would be interested in the
context.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:09.625
If you think about physicians;
we allow physicians to buy

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:13.854
malpractice insurance in case
they kill you by mistake when

00:15:13.854 --> 00:15:18.777
they're doing surgery,
but we don't allow bank robbers

00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:24.931
to buy malpractice insurance so
that if they kill you by mistake

00:15:24.931 --> 00:15:29.620
when they're robbing a bank they
can get off.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:33.029
That tells you right there,
there must be different

00:15:33.029 --> 00:15:37.259
conceptions of harm that operate
in different circumstances.

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:42.111
And indeed, if you want to
start thinking about it a little

00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:45.793
bit more systematically,
harm is treated very

00:15:45.793 --> 00:15:49.139
differently in different
situations.

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:52.788
Think about this continuum I've
put up here.

00:15:52.788 --> 00:15:56.899
Some kinds of harm are
completely excluded.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:16:00.870
You're not held responsible for
them at all.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.306
If you have a death penalty and
legal execution of people,

00:16:04.306 --> 00:16:06.960
of course you harm the person
you execute.

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.296
Certain kinds of wartime
killing, of course you harm the

00:16:11.296 --> 00:16:14.450
person that you kill,
but we allow it.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:19.980
We don't count it as a relevant
harm.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:27.131
Then here, I'm going down this
continuum, we say that the

00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:34.538
intention to kill is very
important in the criminal law.

00:16:34.538 --> 00:16:38.971
Does anyone know what this term
mens rea is in the

00:16:38.971 --> 00:16:40.158
criminal law?
 

00:16:40.158 --> 00:16:44.649
No reason you should,
but somebody might.

00:16:44.649 --> 00:16:48.615
If you're charging somebody
with a criminal offense the

00:16:48.615 --> 00:16:52.726
government has to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt various

00:16:52.726 --> 00:16:56.879
elements of the crime,
that the person did it,

00:16:56.879 --> 00:17:01.976
that in fact that the crime
occurred and that there was

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:05.470
something called mens
rea,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.269
or criminal intent.
 

00:17:07.269 --> 00:17:10.019
"Guilty mind,"
that's what it means.

00:17:10.019 --> 00:17:15.112
And in the criminal law we make
that one of the elements of the

00:17:15.112 --> 00:17:15.769
crime.
 

00:17:15.769 --> 00:17:20.309
That's why things like the
insanity defense become so

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:23.890
contentious because the person
claims,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.460
"Well, because I didn't
know what I was doing,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.980
I didn't have mens rea.
 

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.940
My client didn't have mens
rea.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.355
He didn't know what he was
doing so he's not guilty by

00:17:35.355 --> 00:17:36.710
reason of insanity.
 

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.328
He's not guilty," okay?
 

00:17:39.328 --> 00:17:43.390
Or if you think about--you
might say,

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.396
"Well, we do imprison
people for vehicular homicide

00:17:47.396 --> 00:17:51.038
when they get drunk,"
and the person says,

00:17:51.038 --> 00:17:54.480
"But I didn't intend to
kill them.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.078
I didn't know I was driving.
 

00:17:57.078 --> 00:17:58.720
How can you can you say I
intended?"

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.905
Interestingly there we come up
with a doctrine in the legal

00:18:02.905 --> 00:18:06.009
system which we call
constructive intent.

00:18:06.009 --> 00:18:08.700
And what is the doctrine of
constructive intent?

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.558
It's basically we say,
"Well,

00:18:10.558 --> 00:18:15.101
any reasonable person would
know that if drive down to a

00:18:15.101 --> 00:18:17.753
bar,
and you have no way to get

00:18:17.753 --> 00:18:22.060
home, and you then drink ten
beers you would be putting

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.288
yourself in the position where
could harm someone.

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:29.410
So we're going to impute the
intent to you even though you

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.670
didn't have it."
 

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:32.568
That's the doctrine of
constructive intent.

00:18:32.568 --> 00:18:35.808
That's using exactly that kind
of situation,

00:18:35.808 --> 00:18:40.630
so in the criminal law,
to go back to Mill,

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.817
we'd say "calculated to
produce evil in someone

00:18:43.817 --> 00:18:44.630
else."
 

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:51.673
It's got to be calculated by
the person committing the harm,

00:18:51.673 --> 00:18:52.509
okay?
 

00:18:52.509 --> 00:18:55.140
So, why is that, you might say.
 

00:18:55.140 --> 00:19:00.935
Well, criminal actions are
actions which bring moral

00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:03.549
opprobrium on people.
 

00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:04.900
We lock them up.
 

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.705
They're really things we don't
want people to do,

00:19:08.705 --> 00:19:12.907
and we want people to
internalize the incentive not to

00:19:12.907 --> 00:19:13.858
do them.
 

00:19:13.858 --> 00:19:17.202
So it's about their intentional
actions, and then we're

00:19:17.202 --> 00:19:19.368
punishing them for those
actions.

00:19:19.368 --> 00:19:26.118
Therefore, when we put
sanctions on them we want them

00:19:26.118 --> 00:19:32.608
to know that they could have
behaved otherwise,

00:19:32.608 --> 00:19:36.279
and so we want the intent to be
present,

00:19:36.279 --> 00:19:39.809
so constructive intent is sort
of like intent,

00:19:39.809 --> 00:19:44.589
but not exactly.
 

00:19:44.589 --> 00:19:46.970
What about negligence?
 

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.930
Negligence is even less like
constructive intent.

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:55.165
So negligence is the doctrine
that let's suppose you live in a

00:19:55.165 --> 00:19:58.568
neighborhood where there are
lots of children,

00:19:58.568 --> 00:20:03.318
small children,
and you put in a swimming pool.

00:20:03.318 --> 00:20:10.144
And let's say the law requires
that you fence in your swimming

00:20:10.144 --> 00:20:13.662
pool,
but you leave the fence open,

00:20:13.662 --> 00:20:17.377
the gate open,
and a child goes in and falls

00:20:17.377 --> 00:20:19.490
into your pool and drowns.
 

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.009
The doctrine of negligence
would say,

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:26.548
"Well, yes of course you
didn't intend that the child

00:20:26.548 --> 00:20:29.842
would drown,
but you were negligent in

00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:33.934
leaving the gate open,
so we're going to hold you

00:20:33.934 --> 00:20:35.269
responsible."
 

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:37.769
So it's a little less than
constructive intent.

00:20:37.769 --> 00:20:38.868
It's negligent.
 

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:44.904
Any reasonable person would
know that you shouldn't leave

00:20:44.904 --> 00:20:46.630
the gate open.
 

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.828
So you were negligent.
 

00:20:47.828 --> 00:20:55.005
It's still a state of mind,
but it's obviously not the same

00:20:55.005 --> 00:20:59.828
thing as intending to kill the
child.

00:20:59.828 --> 00:21:03.005
And then we could go even
further down the continuum and

00:21:03.005 --> 00:21:05.451
say,
"There are some situations

00:21:05.451 --> 00:21:09.400
where we say,
'We don't care about your state

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.269
of mind at all.'"
So if an adult has sex with a

00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:17.900
14-year-old and walks in and
says,

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:21.069
"Well, Your Honor,
she said she was 20,

00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:22.548
and I thought she was 20.
 

00:21:22.548 --> 00:21:27.259
She looked 20,"
and perhaps that's true.

00:21:27.259 --> 00:21:30.223
Perhaps all of those things
were true, she said she was 20,

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:32.318
I thought she was 20 and she
looked 20.

00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:36.579
"We don't care,"
we say as a society.

00:21:36.579 --> 00:21:38.000
We don't care.
 

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.250
That's the notion of statutory
rape.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.450
It's sometimes called strict
liability.

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:46.950
We're going to hold you liable
anyway.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.618
And why do we do that?
 

00:21:49.618 --> 00:21:54.807
Presumably to give people the
incentive to make sure as to

00:21:54.807 --> 00:21:55.808
find out.
 

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:59.079
So when we say,
"If she was 14 it's

00:21:59.079 --> 00:22:02.772
statutory rape,
or if he was 14 and she was 20

00:22:02.772 --> 00:22:05.538
it's statutory rape,"
there it is,

00:22:05.538 --> 00:22:06.338
too bad.
 

00:22:06.338 --> 00:22:12.714
We don't care what she said,
and we don't care what you

00:22:12.714 --> 00:22:20.035
believed at the time because we
want to ensure that people have

00:22:20.035 --> 00:22:25.818
the incentive to find it out
correctly."

00:22:25.818 --> 00:22:29.088
Or we could think of Good
Samaritan laws.

00:22:29.088 --> 00:22:32.588
This is the situation where
you're walking along,

00:22:32.588 --> 00:22:35.558
and you see somebody drowning
in a lake,

00:22:35.558 --> 00:22:38.078
and at very little cost to
yourself,

00:22:38.078 --> 00:22:40.368
you could pull them out,
but you say,

00:22:40.368 --> 00:22:43.910
"I'm late for class,
never mind.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.368
I didn't push her in the
lake."

00:22:47.368 --> 00:22:52.048
In many states we have good
Samaritan laws,

00:22:52.048 --> 00:22:55.156
which if it really was at no
trivial cost to yourself you

00:22:55.156 --> 00:22:59.404
could have done that,
you can be prosecuted for

00:22:59.404 --> 00:23:04.885
failing to assist somebody in
need of your help,

00:23:04.885 --> 00:23:05.818
okay?
 

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:12.220
So that's obviously a very
capacious definition of harm.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.046
I mean, after all,
the fact that we're all sitting

00:23:17.046 --> 00:23:22.759
here rather than doing relief
work in Haiti right now means

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:27.390
presumably that some people are
suffering,

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:32.009
perhaps even dying as a result
of our failure to go to Haiti

00:23:32.009 --> 00:23:32.950
right now.
 

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:38.961
So once you go over this line
into treating omissions to help

00:23:38.961 --> 00:23:43.571
as a form of harm,
as we do with Good Samaritan

00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:47.078
laws, where will it end,
right?

00:23:47.078 --> 00:23:51.521
So you can see from this that
if you wanted one definition of

00:23:51.521 --> 00:23:55.742
harm to cover all situations
that obviously isn't going to

00:23:55.742 --> 00:23:57.150
make any sense.
 

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:00.694
Nonetheless,
if you think about this

00:24:00.694 --> 00:24:06.771
continuum, where you fall on it
has huge implications for how

00:24:06.771 --> 00:24:10.519
you're going to run your
society.

00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:17.109
And more interestingly than
that, I've given you a kind of

00:24:17.109 --> 00:24:22.198
static picture now,
but these things actually

00:24:22.198 --> 00:24:23.470
change.
 

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:28.690
Think about the drug
thalidomide.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.838
Who knows what happened with
thalidomide?

00:24:30.838 --> 00:24:32.569
Yeah, what happened with
thalidomide?

00:24:32.569 --> 00:24:36.048
 
 

00:24:36.048 --> 00:24:37.798
Student:  It came out in
the late '50s.

00:24:37.798 --> 00:24:41.538
It was used to treat morning
sickness and it turns out that

00:24:41.538 --> 00:24:45.343
the racemate of the drug causes
teratoma in children born to

00:24:45.343 --> 00:24:47.019
women taking the drug.
 

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:50.819
And so it was basically a
failure of the drug industry to

00:24:50.819 --> 00:24:54.893
look into the effects of the
different structures of drugs in

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:55.640
humans.
 

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:56.490
Prof: Correct.
 

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.930
That's a very good summary.
 

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:02.425
And what's interesting about
thalidomide from our point of

00:25:02.425 --> 00:25:04.880
view is that in developing this
drug,

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.838
which was given for morning
sickness,

00:25:07.838 --> 00:25:12.710
the pharmaceutical companies
didn't cut any corners.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:18.210
They did all the clinical
trails correctly.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.349
They got the FDA approvals.
 

00:25:20.349 --> 00:25:22.440
Everything was done by the book.
 

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:30.479
Nothing illicit was done,
and at that time the general

00:25:30.479 --> 00:25:38.519
standard in tort liability--who
knows what tort means,

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.338
t-o-r-t?
 

00:25:40.338 --> 00:25:42.579
Not t-o-r-t-e,
we're not talking about

00:25:42.579 --> 00:25:43.609
chocolate cake.
 

00:25:43.609 --> 00:25:47.299
What's a tort?
 

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:49.630
Nobody knows what a tort is?
 

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.690
Tort just means harm, right?
 

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:58.436
So the general standard for
tort liability was negligence,

00:25:58.436 --> 00:26:01.869
and they weren't negligent.
 

00:26:01.869 --> 00:26:03.720
They did it by the book.
 

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.970
They got all of the approvals.
 

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.589
They got the clinical trials.
 

00:26:09.589 --> 00:26:12.588
The FDA approved the drug.
 

00:26:12.588 --> 00:26:18.057
And it's a famous case because
it was an instrument by which

00:26:18.057 --> 00:26:22.599
the courts decided to say,
"You know what?

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:25.920
We don't care.
 

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.240
We don't care."
 

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.950
They moved from negligence to
strict liability.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.210
"We don't care that you
did it all right.

00:26:34.210 --> 00:26:38.689
The fact is,
there are all of these children

00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:44.940
who were born with missing
limbs, and you're going to pay.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.358
You, the drug companies,
are going to pay.

00:26:47.358 --> 00:26:49.608
We're going to hold you
strictly liable.

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:53.516
We're going to treat it like
(the example I gave before)

00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:55.150
statutory rape."
 

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.089
Now, you might say,
"Well, why?

00:26:57.089 --> 00:26:59.269
Why would you do that?"
 

00:26:59.269 --> 00:27:05.438
And interestingly the move in
American tort law from

00:27:05.438 --> 00:27:11.560
negligence to strict liability,
those of you who go on from

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.180
here to the Yale Law School will
learn all about it because the

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.278
intellectual giant of the move
from negligence to strict

00:27:20.278 --> 00:27:24.952
liability was Guido Calabresi,
long time Dean of the Yale Law

00:27:24.952 --> 00:27:27.584
School,
and now a Federal Judge on the

00:27:27.584 --> 00:27:28.670
Second Circuit.
 

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.690
He wrote a book called The
Costs of Accidents.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.928
And the main argument of The
Costs of Accidents was--this

00:27:36.928 --> 00:27:39.348
was actually about auto
accidents.

00:27:39.348 --> 00:27:47.538
It was essentially utilitarian
in that Calabresi looked at what

00:27:47.538 --> 00:27:53.880
had already stated in New Jersey
at that time.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.423
If people rear-end one another
in cars you can say,

00:27:58.423 --> 00:28:02.328
"Well, who was negligent
here?"

00:28:02.328 --> 00:28:05.028
Was it the driver in front,
or was it the driver in the

00:28:05.028 --> 00:28:05.380
back?
 

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.880
If it was the driver in the
front,

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:09.586
why, "Oh,
well, he stopped too

00:28:09.586 --> 00:28:12.848
quickly,"
or something like that,

00:28:12.848 --> 00:28:14.848
or the driver at the back says,
"Well,

00:28:14.848 --> 00:28:17.903
my brakes weren't working or
the driver at the front's brake

00:28:17.903 --> 00:28:19.509
lights weren't working."
 

00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:22.200
You have an argument.
 

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.580
And they have their lawyer,
and you have your lawyer,

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.871
and you duke it out,
and somebody wins and somebody

00:28:26.871 --> 00:28:27.328
loses.
 

00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:29.859
New Jersey said,
"It's not worth it.

00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:33.029
It's a waste of court time.
 

00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:35.308
It's a waste of everybody's
time.

00:28:35.308 --> 00:28:40.867
So we're going to make the law
which says, in a rear-ending

00:28:40.867 --> 00:28:46.140
situation, the driver at the
back pays, always."

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:48.303
Kind of rough justice,
sometimes maybe the brake

00:28:48.303 --> 00:28:50.559
lights on the front car really
weren't working.

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.130
"We don't care.
 

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.654
It's just not worth the State
of New Jersey's time to invest

00:28:55.654 --> 00:28:59.118
the institutional resources and
all the rest of it to allow

00:28:59.118 --> 00:29:01.269
people to litigate these things.
 

00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:02.970
It just costs too much.
 

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:04.470
It's not worth it."
 

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.712
So Guido Calabresi came up with
a little algorithm in which he

00:29:08.712 --> 00:29:11.521
said,
"The standard should be to

00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:15.298
minimize the cost of accidents
plus the cost of their

00:29:15.298 --> 00:29:16.680
avoidance."
 

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.651
So you figure out the cost of
all the rear-ending,

00:29:20.651 --> 00:29:21.298
right?
 

00:29:21.298 --> 00:29:24.950
And then you figure out,
well, if we allow people to sue

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.269
what's the cost of avoiding
accidents that way,

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:32.009
whereas if we don't allow them
to sue for negligence,

00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:33.529
what's the cost that way?
 

00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:34.529
It's cheaper.
 

00:29:34.529 --> 00:29:36.009
It's more efficient.
 

00:29:36.009 --> 00:29:38.670
And anyway, there are probably
some good side benefits;

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.705
it gives the person at the back
the right incentive to keep a

00:29:42.705 --> 00:29:44.858
distance they can stop,
right?

00:29:44.858 --> 00:29:47.798
So we make a utilitarian
judgment.

00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:51.710
The game's not worth the candle
for negligence.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.500
That's one defense of it.
 

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.057
Coming back to the thalidomide,
minimize the cost of accidents

00:30:00.057 --> 00:30:02.039
and the cost of their avoidance.
 

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:04.588
What do we want as a society?
 

00:30:04.588 --> 00:30:08.481
We want the drug companies to
have the incentive to go the

00:30:08.481 --> 00:30:12.442
extra mile to do even more
research than they have to do as

00:30:12.442 --> 00:30:16.288
required by the FDA,
to buy the insurance because

00:30:16.288 --> 00:30:19.038
perhaps they're the deepest
pocket.

00:30:19.038 --> 00:30:23.660
They have the resources to do
the research and to buy the

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.650
insurance.
 

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.744
If you're a pregnant woman
thinking about taking a morning

00:30:28.744 --> 00:30:33.199
sickness pill or not taking it,
you don't have the resources to

00:30:33.199 --> 00:30:34.779
do extra research.
 

00:30:34.779 --> 00:30:43.204
So we put the burden on the
party who can most cheaply avoid

00:30:43.204 --> 00:30:43.920
it.
 

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.589
Now, the drug companies are
saying, "That's outrageous.

00:30:46.589 --> 00:30:47.970
It's totally outrageous.
 

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:51.069
We didn't do anything wrong and
you're punishing us."

00:30:51.069 --> 00:30:53.160
Strict liability.
 

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.082
So we moved,
and the example of thalidomide

00:30:56.082 --> 00:30:58.308
is just the tip of an iceberg.
 

00:30:58.308 --> 00:31:02.300
In the whole of tort law
there's been this thirty or

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.449
forty-year move from a
negligence standard to a strict

00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:08.250
liability standard.
 

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:12.430
And a fascinating intellectual
debate between Calabresi,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.608
who's the champion of strict
liability,

00:31:14.608 --> 00:31:17.396
and Richard Posner,
who you probably have read some

00:31:17.396 --> 00:31:21.144
of his books,
a Judge in the Chicago Circuit

00:31:21.144 --> 00:31:25.140
who defends negligence as more
efficient.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:28.230
So it's a debate between
utilitarians in that sense.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.503
And if we had more time I'd
have you read some of that

00:31:32.503 --> 00:31:33.230
debate.
 

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:38.998
You might be convinced at the
end of it that Posner wins

00:31:38.998 --> 00:31:43.823
intellectually,
but as a matter of the politics

00:31:43.823 --> 00:31:46.548
of it, Calabresi wins.
 

00:31:46.548 --> 00:31:52.075
That is to say American tort
law has moved,

00:31:52.075 --> 00:31:58.127
since the 1950s,
away from negligence to strict

00:31:58.127 --> 00:31:59.970
liability.
 

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.750
Let's think of another example.
 

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:09.472
In the 1950s in America,
a husband could not be

00:32:09.472 --> 00:32:13.579
prosecuted for raping his wife.
 

00:32:13.579 --> 00:32:17.240
There was no such crime.
 

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.563
There was, in other words,
a conclusive common law

00:32:20.563 --> 00:32:23.480
presumption that there was no
such crime.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.769
Now you might say, why?
 

00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:27.920
Well, there's a historical
answer.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.443
It went back to the suspension
of the legal identity of the

00:32:33.443 --> 00:32:35.730
woman during marriage.
 

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.807
Essentially,
it goes back to the old

00:32:38.807 --> 00:32:40.480
patriarchal laws.
 

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:45.153
The daughter was more or less
the father's property and then

00:32:45.153 --> 00:32:49.430
he gave his property to the
son-in-law as the husband's

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:50.460
property.
 

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:54.922
So the woman didn't have a
legal identity as a person

00:32:54.922 --> 00:32:58.355
during marriage,
and this is why she lost

00:32:58.355 --> 00:33:01.358
control of her property,
right?

00:33:01.358 --> 00:33:05.351
And that was restored,
ultimately, by the Married

00:33:05.351 --> 00:33:09.675
Women's Property Acts that
recreated women's property

00:33:09.675 --> 00:33:12.452
rights over,
say, inherited wealth or

00:33:12.452 --> 00:33:13.420
whatever it was.
 

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:16.838
It didn't automatically become
her husband's property.

00:33:16.838 --> 00:33:22.212
But there was this hangover
from the nineteenth century that

00:33:22.212 --> 00:33:26.220
a woman couldn't be raped by her
husband,

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:30.778
and not only rape but other
things like assault.

00:33:30.778 --> 00:33:34.453
So in other words,
you could walk up to a woman

00:33:34.453 --> 00:33:37.730
you were not married to on the
street,

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.038
and punch her in the face,
and get arrested for that,

00:33:41.038 --> 00:33:45.461
and convicted of assault,
but if you did it to your wife

00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:47.150
there was no crime.
 

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:53.490
So then we have the women's
movement.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:57.390
We have a lot of feminist
pressure and organization,

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:02.923
and so we now have gone to a
world in which marital rape is a

00:34:02.923 --> 00:34:07.994
felony in about forty-five of
the states and the federal

00:34:07.994 --> 00:34:09.010
system.
 

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:12.144
So it's gone from having a
conclusive common law

00:34:12.144 --> 00:34:15.393
presumption against it,
to making it a felony,

00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:18.489
and all the other things have
gone as well,

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:22.010
so inter-spousal tort immunity
is gone.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.871
You can be prosecuted for
assaulting--in other words,

00:34:25.871 --> 00:34:30.253
marriage is no longer a bar to
things that would be criminal

00:34:30.253 --> 00:34:31.739
actions outside.
 

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:35.664
So we've had a huge change in
the law there from one

00:34:35.664 --> 00:34:40.128
definition of what counts as a
relevant harm to a different

00:34:40.128 --> 00:34:43.900
definition of what counts as a
relevant harm.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:46.927
In the first case it was an
argument about efficiency,

00:34:46.927 --> 00:34:49.268
and the second is a political
movement.

00:34:49.268 --> 00:34:53.920
The women's movement had this
enormous impact on the

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.027
redefinition of what sorts of
harms the state should take

00:34:59.027 --> 00:35:01.400
seriously in marriage.
 

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.380
Let me give you a third example.
 

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:10.190
 
 

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:14.239
If you go into employment law,
or housing law,

00:35:14.239 --> 00:35:22.260
or education,
the American courts have,

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.090
for many decades,
at least since Brown versus

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.965
Board of Education was handed
down by a unanimous Supreme

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:34.480
Court in 1954,
they've been concerned with

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:37.030
trying to get rid of
discrimination.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:42.820
Discrimination's a kind of
harm, right?

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:48.239
So the question is;
what do you have to show?

00:35:48.239 --> 00:35:52.503
What do you have to show to
convince the court that you've

00:35:52.503 --> 00:35:55.570
been harmed and there should be
remedy?

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.409
What do you have to show?
 

00:35:57.409 --> 00:36:05.795
And during the Warren Court it
was somewhat like strict

00:36:05.795 --> 00:36:07.659
liability.
 

00:36:07.659 --> 00:36:10.998
The Warren Court,
Earl Warren was appointed by

00:36:10.998 --> 00:36:13.300
President Eisenhower in 1953.
 

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.300
Eisenhower thought he was
appointing a conservative

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.760
Justice, but he turned out to be
wrong.

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:22.846
Earl Warren was,
perhaps, the most liberal Chief

00:36:22.846 --> 00:36:25.889
Justice of the twentieth
century.

00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:30.269
And the court,
under his leadership,

00:36:30.269 --> 00:36:37.904
developed the idea that all you
had to do was show there was a

00:36:37.904 --> 00:36:42.659
pattern of discriminatory
effects.

00:36:42.659 --> 00:36:47.498
You didn't have to show that
anybody intended to discriminate

00:36:47.498 --> 00:36:48.869
against anyone.
 

00:36:48.869 --> 00:36:52.590
So in the education area,
separate but equal,

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.889
the court said is inherently
unequal.

00:36:55.889 --> 00:37:00.375
We're not saying that the White
southerners are necessarily

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:03.777
prejudiced against Blacks,
many of them were,

00:37:03.777 --> 00:37:07.489
but we're not going to get to
that question.

00:37:07.489 --> 00:37:13.139
We're just saying separate but
equal is inherently impossible.

00:37:13.139 --> 00:37:14.119
It's an oxymoron.
 

00:37:14.119 --> 00:37:17.170
You can't have it,
and we're saying that without

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:21.195
reference to the intentions of
school administrators or anybody

00:37:21.195 --> 00:37:21.780
else.
 

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:29.070
In housing patterns you do
these kinds of studies like Ian

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:36.487
Ayres and the Yale Law School
here is well known for having

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:37.639
done.
 

00:37:37.639 --> 00:37:45.239
When people with exactly the
same objective characteristics,

00:37:45.239 --> 00:37:48.237
same income,
same employment history and so

00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:52.661
on going for a mortgage it turns
out that African Americans are

00:37:52.661 --> 00:37:57.300
denied mortgages at a higher
rate than non-African Americans.

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:01.126
You don't have to show that
that mortgage officer was a

00:38:01.126 --> 00:38:03.039
racist, or was intending.
 

00:38:03.039 --> 00:38:06.726
You produce the statistics,
you show people with these

00:38:06.726 --> 00:38:10.900
objective characteristics who
are African American get denied

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.378
and those with the same
characteristics who are not

00:38:14.378 --> 00:38:17.230
African Americans don't get
denied.

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.929
It's a patter of discriminatory
effects.

00:38:20.929 --> 00:38:24.742
We don't have to get into
something like mens rea

00:38:24.742 --> 00:38:29.039
or whatever is going on in the
bank mortgage officer's head.

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:33.092
So that was the standard also
in employment discrimination and

00:38:33.092 --> 00:38:37.144
many other areas of the law of
discrimination under the Warren

00:38:37.144 --> 00:38:37.809
Court.
 

00:38:37.809 --> 00:38:42.434
All you had to show was a
pattern of discriminatory

00:38:42.434 --> 00:38:43.360
effects.
 

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:47.534
But the Warren Court was
gradually replaced first by the

00:38:47.534 --> 00:38:50.155
Burger Court,
then the Rehnquist Court,

00:38:50.155 --> 00:38:53.981
and now the Roberts Court,
and in that conservative

00:38:53.981 --> 00:39:00.079
evolution discrimination law has
gone this way on the continuum.

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:05.101
Now you can't get a remedy
unless you can show the

00:39:05.101 --> 00:39:11.659
intention to discriminate on the
part of some public official.

00:39:11.659 --> 00:39:17.050
So let's say in zoning
ordinances,

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.364
you've got to show that some
public official actually tried

00:39:21.364 --> 00:39:25.605
to do the zoning in such a way
as to exclude Blacks from a

00:39:25.605 --> 00:39:31.545
certain neighborhood,
let's say, before you can get a

00:39:31.545 --> 00:39:32.579
remedy.
 

00:39:32.579 --> 00:39:34.974
So in employment,
and housing,

00:39:34.974 --> 00:39:38.195
and education,
and all of these areas of

00:39:38.195 --> 00:39:42.489
discrimination we've gone the
other way as a society,

00:39:42.489 --> 00:39:43.480
right?
 

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:48.891
We've gone from a very
capacious standard which would

00:39:48.891 --> 00:39:54.409
allow a remedy just from the
objective indicators,

00:39:54.409 --> 00:39:56.909
the patterns of discriminatory
effects,

00:39:56.909 --> 00:40:00.900
now we treat it more like the
criminal law.

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.300
We say, "Unless you can
show,

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:08.775
you can establish in court that
there was some particular person

00:40:08.775 --> 00:40:14.250
in that bank denying mortgages
who intended to discriminate,

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.960
no remedy."
 

00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:21.920
So it's much harder,
of course, to get remedies.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:26.199
 
 

00:40:26.199 --> 00:40:28.780
So those are three examples.
 

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:34.380
Those are three examples,
the thalidomide,

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:38.150
the marital rape,
and the discrimination,

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:43.646
where you can see that there's
enormous flux in our society as

00:40:43.646 --> 00:40:46.889
to what counts as a relevant
harm.

00:40:46.889 --> 00:40:51.634
And if we had time,
I strongly suspect if we had

00:40:51.634 --> 00:40:57.690
time to have a debate in this
room on those three topics it's

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:03.949
not like we would all agree as
to whether in discrimination law

00:41:03.949 --> 00:41:08.894
it should be patented as
discriminatory effects or

00:41:08.894 --> 00:41:10.409
intent.
 

00:41:10.409 --> 00:41:13.822
We'd have differences of
opinion about that that would

00:41:13.822 --> 00:41:17.298
stem from our assumptions about
the appropriate role of

00:41:17.298 --> 00:41:20.697
government,
how intrusive it should be and

00:41:20.697 --> 00:41:21.250
so on.
 

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:26.195
Or probably there would be less
disagreement today about the

00:41:26.195 --> 00:41:30.889
martial rape than there would
have been in the 1950s,

00:41:30.889 --> 00:41:38.844
and I suspect intuitions would
go all over the place about tort

00:41:38.844 --> 00:41:42.949
liability and the thalidomide.
 

00:41:42.949 --> 00:41:46.730
So what does that tell us?
 

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.644
And this is the second reason I
think it's really instructive to

00:41:51.644 --> 00:41:55.625
work through somebody like Mill
even if, in the end,

00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:58.199
Mill doesn't have the answer.
 

00:41:58.199 --> 00:42:05.670
I think one of the lessons of
this course, and you can see it

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:12.396
here very dramatically,
is that it is impossible to get

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:16.630
rid of political disagreement.
 

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:22.255
It is impossible to reduce
political choices to scientific

00:42:22.255 --> 00:42:24.920
choices all the way down.
 

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.056
Science can play important
roles in making political

00:42:29.056 --> 00:42:32.842
choices,
but it can't make them for us,

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:38.532
so that one of the big goals of
the Enlightenment to come up

00:42:38.532 --> 00:42:44.125
with scientific principles of
politics is never going to be

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:46.440
perfectly realized.
 

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.275
That doesn't mean it can't be
partially realized,

00:42:49.275 --> 00:42:52.110
but it's never going to be
perfectly realized.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.530
You can't wring the politics
out of politics.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:59.179
There's no way to do it.
 

00:42:59.179 --> 00:43:04.867
And so you will see when we
come to read Marx and he talks

00:43:04.867 --> 00:43:08.760
about his utopian communist
society,

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:14.952
one of his one-liners is that,
at the end of the day when we

00:43:14.952 --> 00:43:19.360
finally have the true communist
utopia,

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.610
"Politics will be replaced
by administration,"

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.230
right?
 

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.938
That's a bumper sticker for
saying we're going to wring the

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.199
politics out of politics.
 

00:43:28.199 --> 00:43:35.112
Bentham, looking for the right
objective utilitarian calculus,

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.018
right?
 

00:43:36.018 --> 00:43:39.949
Mill wants to say,
"Well, once the harm's

00:43:39.949 --> 00:43:44.054
triggered we can do the
cost-benefit analysis on

00:43:44.054 --> 00:43:46.849
scientific principles."
 

00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:48.300
We talked about that last time.
 

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.449
Never works.
 

00:43:50.449 --> 00:43:52.679
It never works all the way down.
 

00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:56.157
It doesn't mean to say that
scientific thinking can't

00:43:56.157 --> 00:44:00.710
condition our normative choices,
but you go back and think

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:05.836
through these three examples
that I've just given you these

00:44:05.836 --> 00:44:09.550
are basically normative choices,
right?

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.422
In the 1950s when this issue
about marital rape came up,

00:44:13.422 --> 00:44:17.719
a lot of things were said that
are similar to what is said now

00:44:17.719 --> 00:44:19.340
about gay marriage.
 

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.978
People said if the state starts
prosecuting husbands we're going

00:44:23.978 --> 00:44:26.630
to destroy the traditional
family.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:31.949
And people the women's movement
said, "Great!

00:44:31.949 --> 00:44:35.248
We're going to destroy this
traditional family because men

00:44:35.248 --> 00:44:37.389
shouldn't be allowed to rape
women.

00:44:37.389 --> 00:44:39.579
At least in this respect we won
it," right?

00:44:39.579 --> 00:44:44.998
So traditional values only
takes you so far because the

00:44:44.998 --> 00:44:49.898
harm principle is by definition,
a critical principle for

00:44:49.898 --> 00:44:52.389
looking at traditional values
and saying,

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:54.539
"How much should we cater
to them,

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:56.679
how much not," right?
 

00:44:56.679 --> 00:45:01.460
So these are political choices.
 

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:07.431
The choice about thalidomide
has huge distributive

00:45:07.431 --> 00:45:11.210
consequences,
huge, enormous.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.300
You're going to say to
pharmaceutical companies,

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.934
"You're going to be liable
from now on for the harmful

00:45:17.934 --> 00:45:21.568
effects of your drugs regardless
of whether you got the FDA

00:45:21.568 --> 00:45:22.760
approval."
 

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:29.300
It's a huge burden to put on
them.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.329
Notice what we could say.
 

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:34.411
We could say,
"No, (as a famous

00:45:34.411 --> 00:45:39.869
libertarian Judge Learned Hand
said) in society losses must lie

00:45:39.869 --> 00:45:42.159
where they fall."
 

00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:43.670
What does that mean?
 

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:47.670
It basically means the women
who had the thalidomide children

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:51.469
and the children themselves must
internalize the loss,

00:45:51.469 --> 00:45:55.606
or we could say,
"We'll socialize the

00:45:55.606 --> 00:45:56.920
risk."
 

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:02.452
We'll say, "In these kinds
of situations when there was no

00:46:02.452 --> 00:46:06.469
wrongdoing in the sense of
cutting corners;

00:46:06.469 --> 00:46:10.619
the government will bail them
out."

00:46:10.619 --> 00:46:15.820
Just like we did after 9/11,
we created this huge fund and

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.838
paid compensation to the
relatives of people who died in

00:46:20.838 --> 00:46:21.659
9/11.
 

00:46:21.659 --> 00:46:25.954
Many people die all the time in
disasters where we don't do

00:46:25.954 --> 00:46:27.510
that, but we could.
 

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:32.780
We could have massive social
insurance for unexpected harms.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:38.349
So the choice to say,
"Losses must lie where

00:46:38.349 --> 00:46:42.760
they fall,"
with Learned Hand,

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.630
or that we should socialize it
by saying,

00:46:45.630 --> 00:46:51.739
"Well, if you're born with
a physical deformity,

00:46:51.739 --> 00:46:54.400
obviously it's through no fault
of your own,

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.266
but really you can't blame the
manufacturer of thalidomide

00:46:57.266 --> 00:46:59.369
either,
so the state will pick it up.

00:46:59.369 --> 00:47:00.869
We as a society will do
it."

00:47:00.869 --> 00:47:02.420
That's a different choice.
 

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:05.371
Or if you say,
"No, we're going to make

00:47:05.371 --> 00:47:09.010
thalidomide--the manufacturer
internalizes this,"

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.070
that's a different choice.
 

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:14.199
My point here is it's always a
choice.

00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:19.230
It's always a choice.
 

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:22.239
We'll come to read a
libertarian called Robert Nozick

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:26.061
later in the course,
and one of his one-liners is

00:47:26.061 --> 00:47:31.226
that, "The fundamental
question of political theory is

00:47:31.226 --> 00:47:35.500
whether or not there should be a
state."

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.719
But we'll see that that's a bit
like saying,

00:47:38.719 --> 00:47:43.559
"The fundamental question
of dental theory is whether or

00:47:43.559 --> 00:47:48.237
not there should be teeth,"
because in fact everything

00:47:48.237 --> 00:47:50.820
involves collective choices.
 

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.480
Even the collective choice to
let the loss lie where it falls,

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.699
that is itself a collective
choice.

00:47:56.699 --> 00:47:59.768
So you can't wring the politics
out of politics.

00:47:59.768 --> 00:48:03.719
And at least one goal of the
Enlightenment,

00:48:03.719 --> 00:48:06.487
we're going to see,
there's this idea of replacing

00:48:06.487 --> 00:48:09.896
politics with science,
or in Marx's formulation,

00:48:09.896 --> 00:48:13.730
of politics being displaced by
administration,

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.389
can never be perfectly realized.
 

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:20.990
And that's an important insight
we get from thinking about

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:24.219
trying to apply Mill's harm
principle.

00:48:24.219 --> 00:48:26.739
Okay, see you on Monday.
 

00:48:26.739 --> 00:48:32.000

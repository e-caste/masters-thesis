00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.913
Prof: Today we're going
to talk about inter-specific

00:00:03.913 --> 00:00:04.460
competition.
 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.928
And you will remember that last
time I was talking about

00:00:07.928 --> 00:00:12.802
intra-specific competition,
and we were looking a bit at

00:00:12.802 --> 00:00:17.490
the impact of density on
population growth.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.767
And I want you to remember that
if an individual is encountering

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:25.001
increased population density,
during its life,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.180
as it grows from a zygote up
through an adult and reproduces,

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.336
the effect of increasing
density will be to decrease its

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:33.140
growth rate.
 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.210
It will be smaller when it
matures.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.730
It will have fewer babies.
 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.944
Often the babies will be of
lower quality,

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:42.130
and the mortality rates in the
population will be higher.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.250
So that's the general impact of
intra-specific competition.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.956
However, animals don't live in
a world, and plants don't live

00:00:48.956 --> 00:00:51.618
in a world, where they only
encounter other members of their

00:00:51.618 --> 00:00:52.340
own species.
 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.450
They're often living in a
complex ecological community.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.191
And so what we want to do is
understand what happens to them

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:02.200
in a complex community.
 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.504
And I'm going to do this by
showing you some classical

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:08.558
descriptive patterns;
then move through to some

00:01:08.558 --> 00:01:11.150
experiments to demonstrate
competition;

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.777
give you an abstract conceptual
framework in which to think

00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:17.858
about this;
and then return to the complex

00:01:17.858 --> 00:01:20.580
reality of competition,
at the end.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.540
Okay?
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.748
So, a reminder that it's often
useful, when you're thinking

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:29.593
about interactions between
species, to just use simple

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:30.319
logic.
 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.402
You'll remember in an earlier
lecture I said,

00:01:32.402 --> 00:01:35.147
"Don't be afraid of using
simple logic in constructing

00:01:35.147 --> 00:01:36.190
your papers."
 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.188
This is the kind of thing that
could lay down a nice simple

00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:42.031
introductory logical framework
for something that you're

00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:42.910
dealing with.
 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.793
This particular one is about
biological interactions in

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:47.800
communities.
 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.310
So if species' 1 effect on
species 2 is in this column,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.700
and species' 2 effect on
species 1 is in this column,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.390
and species 1 has a negative
effect on species 2,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.340
and species 2 has a negative
effect on species 1,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.569
then we've got competition.
 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.758
If species 1 has a positive
effect on species 2,

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:13.318
and species 2 has a negative
effect on species 1,

00:02:13.318 --> 00:02:16.914
then species 1 is food,
and species 2 is eating it

00:02:16.914 --> 00:02:18.530
&gt;
 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.419
, and you've got predation,
parasitism or grazing.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.560
If species 1 has a negative
effect on species 2,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.770
and species 2 has no effect on
species 1,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.449
we call that amensalism,
and you can contrast that with

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.199
commensalism,
where the relationship is --0.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.331
So here, for example,
species 1 might be

00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:45.628
benefiting--its effect on
species 2 is positive.

00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:48.367
So species 2 is benefiting from
its presence,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.169
but there's no effect the other
way around.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:53.935
So basically what's going on
here is species 2 might be

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:56.699
living in species 1,
but not impacting it otherwise.

00:02:56.699 --> 00:03:00.531
It might be very small or it
might not--it might just fit in,

00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:02.318
in a very comfortable way.
 

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:06.408
So this kind of plus/minus
framework is a useful overall

00:03:06.408 --> 00:03:09.681
way to see what we're
concentrating on today,

00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:11.538
which is competition.
 

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:15.241
And here are some of the
natural history patterns that

00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:19.223
suggested to ecologists that
inter-specific competition is

00:03:19.223 --> 00:03:20.900
important in Nature.
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.375
This is one of Jared Diamond's
observations,

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:25.830
from New Guinea.
 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.449
And this is a thrush.
 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.878
There are a couple of species
of thrush there.

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.818
There are two species in the
same genus.

00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:33.877
Usually when two species are in
the same genus,

00:03:33.877 --> 00:03:36.519
they're ecologically pretty
similar, they tend to eat pretty

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.370
similar things.
 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.881
And the interesting thing about
this pattern is that you're

00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:42.646
going up a mountainside,
and this species is getting

00:03:42.646 --> 00:03:46.788
more and more and more abundant,
and then suddenly it disappears.

00:03:46.788 --> 00:03:48.960
And if you're coming down from
the top of the mountain,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.169
this species is getting more
and more abundant,

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:54.453
and then suddenly it
disappears, right here at about

00:03:54.453 --> 00:03:57.470
5500 feet elevation;
just about one mile high.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.835
So it looks like the two
species are butting into each

00:03:59.835 --> 00:04:02.603
other and they're excluding each
other right at the point where

00:04:02.603 --> 00:04:04.210
they're each doing really great.
 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.020
So that's a suggestive pattern.
 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.016
It doesn't demonstrate that the
reason for the border here is

00:04:15.016 --> 00:04:18.399
inter-specific competition.
 

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.220
Anybody have an idea what else
might do that?

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:28.560
They each carry a disease that
knocks out the other one.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.480
Okay?
 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.850
That'll do it.
 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.228
It could be that this one
actually can resist a predator

00:04:40.228 --> 00:04:44.810
that eats its eggs,
or something like that,

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.060
and this one can't resist that
predator,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.350
and vice-versa.
 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.370
So it could be apparent
competition.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.579
Okay?
 

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:55.995
Without an experiment,
you don't actually know what is

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.079
making that sharp line.
 

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:00.673
But it's suggestive,
it looks like it could be

00:05:00.673 --> 00:05:01.480
competition.
 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.730
Then Robert MacArthur did a lot
of work on warblers for his

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.096
Ph.D.
 

00:05:06.096 --> 00:05:06.829
thesis.
 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:10.976
And the thing that you want to
concentrate on in this picture

00:05:10.976 --> 00:05:15.055
is the different parts of the
spruce tree that the different

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:16.230
warblers use.
 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.625
So the Cape May--this is a
diagram of half a spruce tree,

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:22.959
cut in half -- using the middle
and lower inner part.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.822
The Blackburnian warbler is
using the outer middle third

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:28.528
about.
 

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:31.769
The Bay-breasted warbler is
using about the upper outer

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:32.250
third.
 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.399
The black-throated green
warbler is using some of the

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:38.211
inner part here,
and the Myrtle warbler is down

00:05:38.211 --> 00:05:40.591
inside the tree,
about here, and then down close

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:41.259
to the ground.
 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:45.060
So it looks like the warblers
of North America have taken the

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.798
spruce tree and they've divided
it up so that they don't run

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:53.057
into each other too much,
and they're each using a

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:54.629
different part.
 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.124
That's an interesting
observation, because if you

00:05:57.124 --> 00:05:59.704
think about it,
what it means is that they're

00:05:59.704 --> 00:06:03.218
guaranteeing that they're going
to run into more intra-specific

00:06:03.218 --> 00:06:04.069
competition.
 

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.759
They're avoiding inter,
but they're running into more

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.259
intra-specific competition.
 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.562
So that if you say, "Hey,
this has been caused by

00:06:11.562 --> 00:06:14.370
competition,"
you're making an implicit

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.290
assumption about how strong that
those relationships are.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.985
This one is saying
inter-specific has probably been

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:23.629
more important than
intra-specific competition.

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:24.699
Okay?
 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:28.646
So again a very suggestive
pattern, but not confirmed by

00:06:28.646 --> 00:06:29.579
experiment.
 

00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:35.622
Now, those sorts of patterns
led Evelyn Hutchinson to suggest

00:06:35.622 --> 00:06:42.170
this kind of view of why we find
so many species on the planet.

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.574
He says basically over a long
period of time evolution will

00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:49.298
fill the world up with species,
and they will get better and

00:06:49.298 --> 00:06:52.509
better at exploiting the
resources they encounter,

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.894
and competition will limit the
number of species you can pack

00:06:56.894 --> 00:06:58.209
onto the planet.
 

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:01.088
At about the time that
Hutchinson was thinking about

00:07:01.088 --> 00:07:02.865
this,
various people,

00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:07.178
including Garrett Hardin,
were enunciating what's called

00:07:07.178 --> 00:07:09.560
the competitive exclusion
principle;

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.922
that two species with very
similar resource needs in

00:07:12.922 --> 00:07:17.009
physiology can't co-exist in the
same place, at equilibrium.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.771
So the assumptions behind that
are that we're looking at an

00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:24.079
equilibrium that's established
after a long time;

00:07:24.079 --> 00:07:26.639
that the competitive exclusion
principle applies.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:30.689
That means two species cannot
occupy exactly the same niche--

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:34.242
which is what it looks like is
going on with the warblers and

00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:37.334
the thrushes in New Guinea--
and that diversity is

00:07:37.334 --> 00:07:40.399
determined primarily by
competition rather than by

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.529
predation or by disease or
something like that.

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:48.961
So let's see to what extent
this kind of thinking has

00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:53.139
occasionally been confirmed in
Nature.

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.865
And one of the first field
experiments, showing that

00:07:56.865 --> 00:08:01.173
competition was really quite
important, between two species,

00:08:01.173 --> 00:08:03.220
was done by Joe Connell.
 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.115
Joe Connell is much revered
Emeritus Professor at the

00:08:06.115 --> 00:08:08.790
University of California at
Santa Barbara now.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:09.812
He did his Ph.D.
 

00:08:09.812 --> 00:08:12.944
thesis at the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland,

00:08:12.944 --> 00:08:16.459
and he worked on barnacles that
were living in the rocky

00:08:16.459 --> 00:08:18.250
intertidal in Scotland.
 

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.293
And in particular he contrasted
Balanus balanoides and

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:25.990
Chthamalus stellatus;
and Balanus and is big and

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.560
Chthamalus is small.
 

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.670
And the pattern that he
found--and he confirmed this by

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.379
doing manipulation experiments
in the field--

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:37.580
is that the larvae of Balanus,
which is big,

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.399
settle out over a big tidal
range.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:46.178
This is mean higher water;
this is mean lower spring water;

00:08:46.178 --> 00:08:48.590
this is mean lower normal tide
range.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:49.210
Okay?
 

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:53.038
So once a month the tides get
this high, and at that point the

00:08:53.038 --> 00:08:56.928
larvae of Balanus can settle out
over the whole tidal range.

00:08:56.928 --> 00:09:01.070
However, Balanus is sensitive
to drying out,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:05.067
and so as these larvae grow up,
many of them die because

00:09:05.067 --> 00:09:09.524
they're getting desiccated,
and so the upper range of

00:09:09.524 --> 00:09:10.889
Balanus drops.
 

00:09:10.889 --> 00:09:14.860
However, it does just fine over
the whole tidal range below

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:15.340
that.
 

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.322
And down here,
the problem that Balanus is

00:09:17.322 --> 00:09:20.225
encountering is that primarily
there are other Balanus around

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.288
crowding them out.
 

00:09:21.288 --> 00:09:23.450
And, by the way,
when two barnacles grow right

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.899
up next to each other,
one of them can actually grow

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:29.519
under the other and pry it off;
so it'll fall off.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.868
So you might think that
barnacles look like extremely

00:09:31.868 --> 00:09:33.485
boring,
slow moving rocks,

00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:37.044
but in fact they have a little
bit of direct competitive

00:09:37.044 --> 00:09:38.470
activity for space.
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:42.125
Chthamalus is a little guy,
and what Chthamalus does

00:09:42.125 --> 00:09:46.423
basically is it gets a refuge up
in the dry part of the upper

00:09:46.423 --> 00:09:47.500
intertidal.
 

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.596
Its larvae can actually settle
pretty high up,

00:09:51.596 --> 00:09:56.240
and it can survive up here,
where Balanus cannot.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.129
So its problem is primarily
getting scrunched by Balanus at

00:10:01.129 --> 00:10:02.899
lower tidal ranges.
 

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:07.340
And by doing cage experiments
and removal experiments,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.750
where he actually took one type
or the other off the rock,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.990
and came back--and he actually
mapped them out,

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.865
so he followed each
individual--Connell could show

00:10:16.865 --> 00:10:18.860
that this was what was going on.
 

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:23.313
Another famous set of early
competition experiments were

00:10:23.313 --> 00:10:24.610
done by Gause.
 

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.937
Gause was a Russian ecologist,
who became a Russian

00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:30.732
epidemiologist,
and he did some early work,

00:10:30.732 --> 00:10:33.330
back in the 1920s,
using Paramecia.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:38.808
And he used three species:
Aurelia, Caudatum and Bursaria.

00:10:38.808 --> 00:10:43.320
And what he showed basically is
that if you grow them alone,

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.606
this is their density,
that you can measure,

00:10:46.606 --> 00:10:51.017
per milliliter;
and if you grow them together,

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:55.649
that Aurelia will exclude
Caudatum completely;

00:10:55.649 --> 00:10:59.995
and that if you compete
Caudatum and Bursaria together,

00:10:59.995 --> 00:11:02.250
they can actually coexist.
 

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:06.509
So from these early experiments
it did look--

00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:08.652
by the way, in this
circumstance they are both

00:11:08.652 --> 00:11:11.222
persisting at much lower
population densities than when

00:11:11.222 --> 00:11:12.080
they're alone.
 

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.450
You can see that from the
y-axis.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.038
This goes up to 75;
that goes up to 200.

00:11:16.038 --> 00:11:19.389
So they are depressing each
other's densities.

00:11:19.389 --> 00:11:21.710
You can tell that they're
competing because of that

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.360
observation.
 

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.379
But they manage to coexist,
they don't go extinct.

00:11:25.379 --> 00:11:27.899
So it looked here like there
were two possible options.

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:33.330
One wins and the other goes
extinct, or they co-exist.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:38.051
Now over the last fifty or
sixty years there have been a

00:11:38.051 --> 00:11:41.399
lot of competition experiments
done,

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:45.740
and after Connell,
and then later Bob Payne,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.932
who was working more on
predators, did these removal and

00:11:49.932 --> 00:11:53.956
caging experiments,
people had a frenzy of

00:11:53.956 --> 00:11:58.690
experimentation out in Nature,
where they would remove one

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.990
species and then see what
happened to another.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.019
Nelson Hairston did it with
salamanders,

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:06.047
down in North Carolina,
on a huge scale in the

00:12:06.047 --> 00:12:09.677
Appalachian Mountains,
and managed to demonstrate that

00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:13.129
if you pull one salamander out,
the density of the other one

00:12:13.129 --> 00:12:15.261
increases,
and they grow faster and they

00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:16.220
have more babies.
 

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.548
So you can--by removing one,
you can demonstrate that there

00:12:19.548 --> 00:12:21.038
is competition going on.
 

00:12:21.038 --> 00:12:26.253
In all those many experiments,
one of the important take-home

00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:31.379
points is that the results are
usually highly asymmetric.

00:12:31.379 --> 00:12:36.269
That means that the removal of
one of the competing species has

00:12:36.269 --> 00:12:39.110
a much bigger impact on the
other;

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.937
species 1 having a big impact
on species 2,

00:12:41.937 --> 00:12:45.845
and removing species 2 often
doesn't have such a big impact

00:12:45.845 --> 00:12:46.990
on species 1.
 

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:51.629
So asymmetric competition
appears to be fairly common.

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:56.095
And it can get so asymmetric
that it may be amensalism rather

00:12:56.095 --> 00:12:57.509
than competition.
 

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:00.635
So in some cases you get
removing one has no impact on

00:13:00.635 --> 00:13:04.293
the other, whereas you do it the
other way around and there's a

00:13:04.293 --> 00:13:05.179
big impact.
 

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:08.340
Okay?
 

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.750
So there's a continuum of these
kinds of cases.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.089
And often what's going on is
that competition for one

00:13:16.089 --> 00:13:19.879
resource is reducing the ability
of a species to compete for

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:20.649
another.
 

00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:23.101
So, for example,
if plants are competing by

00:13:23.101 --> 00:13:25.994
shading each other out,
then the plant that's getting

00:13:25.994 --> 00:13:28.269
shaded is having a harder time
building roots,

00:13:28.269 --> 00:13:30.528
which is giving it difficulty
getting the water.

00:13:30.528 --> 00:13:33.774
So you can see there can be a
cascade of effects that

00:13:33.774 --> 00:13:36.460
inter-specific competition might
trigger.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.792
And just as a side note,
plants have developed an early

00:13:39.792 --> 00:13:43.062
warning system to indicate
whether they're coming into

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:44.048
competition.
 

00:13:44.048 --> 00:13:46.229
They can't tell them whether
they're dealing with another

00:13:46.229 --> 00:13:49.168
species or not,
but if they're starting to get

00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:53.807
shaded by another species,
or by another plant,

00:13:53.807 --> 00:13:59.668
then the ratio of near-red to
far-red light,

00:13:59.668 --> 00:14:01.370
that's coming into their
chloroplasts,

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.759
is getting shifted by being
shaded,

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:06.000
and they actually produce a
hormone,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.620
that gives a signal to the
plant, oh,

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.009
I'm getting shaded in that
direction,

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:11.509
and they will grow a branch out
in the other direction;

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:13.750
so they'll grow away from shade
and toward light,

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:16.645
and they actually have an early
warning system that's detecting

00:14:16.645 --> 00:14:17.440
competitions.
 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.871
Annie Schmitt,
up at Brown University,

00:14:19.871 --> 00:14:22.240
has done interesting work on
that.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.590
Now how to conceptualize all of
this?

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.330
Well if we take those
observations we had,

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:32.110
from the last lecture on
density dependence,

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.610
this guy Verhulst,
who was a Belgian demographer,

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:42.860
developed a simple modification
of the exponential equation that

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.610
we were looking at.
 

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:48.325
And the key idea there is that
as density goes up,

00:14:48.325 --> 00:14:52.418
the per capita rate of increase
is going to decline.

00:14:52.418 --> 00:14:55.910
So it's going to decline
linearly until it reaches 0 at

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:56.168
K.
 

00:14:56.168 --> 00:14:58.879
And if you look at this,
right here--

00:14:58.879 --> 00:15:02.570
so if density goes up,
and when N = K,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.908
you have 1 minus 1,
which is 0, and that means that

00:15:05.908 --> 00:15:10.048
the rate of change of population
per unit time equals something

00:15:10.048 --> 00:15:10.850
times 0.
 

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:11.590
Okay?
 

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.014
So it levels out;
and that's what's going on

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:15.950
right here.
 

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.876
This is increasing,
but the rate at which it's

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:21.870
increasing is being affected by
the density.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.490
So density is on this axis,
K is right here.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.815
And as you get that N closer
and closer to K,

00:15:27.815 --> 00:15:31.668
this part of it's getting
closer and closer to 0.

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:34.664
So the multiplication rate is
dropping and it smoothes right

00:15:34.664 --> 00:15:34.970
out.
 

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:40.048
In fact, in this simple model,
the maximum rate of increase is

00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:42.629
here, when N is equal to K/2.
 

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:54.495
These are the two guys that
extended that into multi-species

00:15:54.495 --> 00:15:59.178
competition: Alfred Lotka and
Vito Volterra.

00:15:59.178 --> 00:16:03.187
And Lotka was a demographer at
Johns Hopkins,

00:16:03.187 --> 00:16:08.379
and worked oh between about
1915 and about 1935 mostly.

00:16:08.379 --> 00:16:14.408
And Vito Volterra was a really
eminent Italian mathematician,

00:16:14.408 --> 00:16:18.518
who had a son-in-law who was
engaged in fisheries management

00:16:18.518 --> 00:16:21.581
in the Mediterranean,
and the son-in-law would

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:24.480
occasionally have dinner with
the father-in-law,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:27.389
and would bring to the
father-in-law certain conceptual

00:16:27.389 --> 00:16:29.490
problems dealing with the
fisheries,

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:32.207
like, "Well let's suppose
that we have two fish species

00:16:32.207 --> 00:16:33.960
that are competing with each
other,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.690
but we can conceive of the
fishing fleet being a predator

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.000
acting on them;
how should we predict the

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:39.950
dynamics?"
 

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.107
And Volterra,
who really was a pretty

00:16:43.107 --> 00:16:47.341
profound mathematician,
found these problems amusing,

00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:51.580
and he tended to write down the
answers on napkins at dinner,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.009
and hand them to his son.
 

00:16:53.009 --> 00:16:57.970
So they were more or less
throwaway lines for him.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:02.489
Now the way that they--these
two guys, who came up with the

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:06.773
same way of conceptualizing
these problems--the way they

00:17:06.773 --> 00:17:09.190
conceptualized it was this.
 

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:11.640
This is the essence of it right
here.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.458
They've both decided that what
they would try to do is

00:17:15.458 --> 00:17:19.925
basically use the single species
framework and just convert the

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:23.961
density of the other species
into an equivalent number of

00:17:23.961 --> 00:17:25.329
this species.
 

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.250
Okay?
 

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.202
And that's what these alpha
competition coefficients are

00:17:30.202 --> 00:17:31.210
going to do.
 

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:35.759
And so they wrote down
differential equations that have

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:38.454
a term up here,
that includes the

00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:40.730
inter-specific effects.
 

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.900
And if you look at the logistic
equation,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.160
which had that nice smooth
approach to a saturation point,

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.365
you'll notice that there is a
chunk of these equations that

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:57.279
looks just like the chunk of the
logistic equation,

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:59.650
except they've stuck in this
little term here.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:02.038
So what they're basically
saying here is this.

00:18:02.038 --> 00:18:03.828
I'll read it out to you in
English.

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:07.333
"The rate of change of
species 1 is equal to the

00:18:07.333 --> 00:18:10.230
intrinsic rate of increase of
species 1,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.848
times the number of species 1,
which are present,

00:18:13.848 --> 00:18:19.413
times a factor that you're
using to account for

00:18:19.413 --> 00:18:21.348
density."
 

00:18:21.348 --> 00:18:24.153
And the way you account for
density is take the carrying

00:18:24.153 --> 00:18:25.963
capacity of species 1,
and you ask,

00:18:25.963 --> 00:18:28.680
"How far away from that
carrying capacity are we?"

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.538
Well we have to subtract the
number of species 1 which are

00:18:32.538 --> 00:18:33.079
there.
 

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:33.868
Okay?
 

00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:36.959
So we might be a long away from
carrying capacity,

00:18:36.959 --> 00:18:39.230
because we have some of species
1;

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:44.798
and we convert species 2 into a
number that's equivalent to a

00:18:44.798 --> 00:18:46.838
number of species 1.
 

00:18:46.838 --> 00:18:49.700
And we do the same thing over
here.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:54.210
So this is very similar to K -
N/K.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:02.740
And you'll see that basically
when this number here,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:08.929
N1 alpha 1,2 N2 = K1,
we have K1 - K1,

00:19:08.929 --> 00:19:11.940
which is 0/K1.
 

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.982
So as this gets larger and
larger, the rate of increase is

00:19:15.982 --> 00:19:17.970
going to smoothly go to 0.
 

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.729
So they did posit what is
probably the simplest way to

00:19:21.729 --> 00:19:26.269
make that one species situation
into a two species situation,

00:19:26.269 --> 00:19:29.762
and they did it by assuming
that you could just convert one

00:19:29.762 --> 00:19:32.711
species into the other,
in terms of its impact on

00:19:32.711 --> 00:19:34.259
inter-specific competition.
 

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:42.210
Now, let me go back there for a
minute.

00:19:47.328 --> 00:19:50.640
These differential equations
are not easy to solve;

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:56.115
and in fact it's a system of
differential equations that are

00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:58.250
linked to each other.
 

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.063
But there are some simple
tricks that you can use to get

00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:06.500
some insight into the dynamic
behavior of a system like this,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:11.230
whether you have a numerical
solution or not.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.384
And so I'm now going to show
you that simple trick,

00:20:13.384 --> 00:20:14.980
and we'll practice it a little
bit.

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.740
So here we have plots of N1
versus N2.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.368
So what we have done is we've
created a phase space.

00:20:26.368 --> 00:20:29.868
And it's important to realize
what I'm talking about now.

00:20:29.868 --> 00:20:33.295
I am not talking about an axis
in which we are plotting the

00:20:33.295 --> 00:20:36.190
population density of the
species against time.

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.839
I'm talking about axes where we
have the population density of

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:43.550
one species plotted against the
population density of the other

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:44.269
species.
 

00:20:44.269 --> 00:20:46.904
And time has disappeared,
for the moment,

00:20:46.904 --> 00:20:49.868
from our consideration,
when we look at it.

00:20:49.868 --> 00:20:57.084
So this is the zero-growth
isocline, and basically what

00:20:57.084 --> 00:21:04.566
this line here is expressing,
at what points is species 1

00:21:04.566 --> 00:21:06.568
increasing?
 

00:21:06.568 --> 00:21:10.210
And the answer is that if there
aren't any species 2 present--

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.682
so we're down at 0,
on the y-axis,

00:21:12.682 --> 00:21:16.278
no species 2 present--
it reverts to the simple

00:21:16.278 --> 00:21:17.480
logistic model.
 

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:22.641
And species 1 will increase up
to the point where it hits its

00:21:22.641 --> 00:21:24.618
carrying capacity,
K.

00:21:24.618 --> 00:21:28.397
If it goes over that carrying
capacity, it will decrease until

00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:30.380
it hits the carrying capacity.
 

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.318
That's the assumption of the
model.

00:21:32.318 --> 00:21:39.298
The species 2 isocline
intersects the y-axis--

00:21:39.298 --> 00:21:43.156
not the x-axis but the
y-axis--at the carrying capacity

00:21:43.156 --> 00:21:46.047
of species 2,
and if there are no species 1

00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:48.172
present,
then we're just down to this

00:21:48.172 --> 00:21:50.680
one axis,
and species 2 will increase

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:54.288
until it hits its carrying
capacity of species 1,

00:21:54.288 --> 00:21:57.594
and species 2 will decrease if
it's over that carrying

00:21:57.594 --> 00:21:58.279
capacity.
 

00:21:58.279 --> 00:22:02.167
What the isocline does is it
gives you the effects of

00:22:02.167 --> 00:22:06.280
converting the other species
into equivalent competition

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.298
units for this species.
 

00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:11.778
So if you're looking here at
the species 1 situation,

00:22:11.778 --> 00:22:14.509
and you start adding in some
species 2,

00:22:14.509 --> 00:22:19.630
then it will hit its
zero-growth point,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.500
its carrying capacity,
at a lower and lower density of

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.044
species 1,
because there's some species 2

00:22:26.044 --> 00:22:27.970
there,
that are competing with it.

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.358
And this line tells you exactly
where that will happen.

00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:35.872
Everywhere along this line
species 1 has a zero growth

00:22:35.872 --> 00:22:36.599
rate.
 

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:38.480
Similarly, for species 2.
 

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.835
What this line is doing is
telling you what the impact of

00:22:41.835 --> 00:22:44.230
competition, coming in from
species 1 is,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.250
on species 2.
 

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:49.669
And as you add in species 1,
by increasing the numbers out

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:52.403
here,
it is reducing the density at

00:22:52.403 --> 00:22:56.556
which species 2 reaches its
carrying capacity and its zero

00:22:56.556 --> 00:22:59.005
growth rate;
which is why this line is

00:22:59.005 --> 00:23:01.769
pointing down here,
this line is pointing up here.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.868
I'm now going to show you the
four possible outcomes,

00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:15.269
of putting these things
together, but before I do it,

00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:19.608
I'd like you to take a moment
and turn to your colleague,

00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:23.892
and explain to them what these
axes mean and why the arrows

00:23:23.892 --> 00:23:25.960
point in those directions.
 

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.423
And then I'd like to take any
questions about somebody that

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.650
doesn't understand this,
because when I show you the

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.719
next picture,
if you haven't got that clear

00:23:32.719 --> 00:23:35.161
in your mind,
the next picture is just going

00:23:35.161 --> 00:23:36.900
to be a little hard to digest.
 

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.208
So take a minute and try to
explain this to each other,

00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:41.259
and then ask me questions if
you don't get it.

00:23:41.259 --> 00:25:30.910
&lt;&lt;Students confer with
one another&gt;&gt;

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:36.509
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:36.509 --> 00:25:39.861
We have the opportunity for an
immediate quiz on how well you

00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:41.898
got it,
because when I show you the

00:25:41.898 --> 00:25:44.606
four possible outcomes,
I can ask you to explain why

00:25:44.606 --> 00:25:46.900
the vectors move in the
direction that they do.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:50.145
These are the four possible
outcomes of competition between

00:25:50.145 --> 00:25:50.930
two species.
 

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.220
The first one is that species 1
wins.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:58.710
And that species 1 here is
always indicated in red,

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:03.118
and you can always tell which
isocline belongs to which

00:26:03.118 --> 00:26:08.019
species by looking at where the
isocline is intersecting,

00:26:08.019 --> 00:26:09.259
and how it's labeled.
 

00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:09.940
Okay?
 

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.681
So we know that this isocline
belongs to species 1,

00:26:13.681 --> 00:26:16.298
because the K1 is on the N1
axis.

00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:20.565
And what you see here is that
species 1 is able to grow at

00:26:20.565 --> 00:26:23.782
higher densities,
across the entire range of

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:27.450
densities of both species,
than is species 2.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:30.097
In this intermediate area,
between the two lines,

00:26:30.097 --> 00:26:33.519
species 2 is above its carrying
capacity and it's dying out.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:38.556
So basically this is a case
where species 1 excludes species

00:26:38.556 --> 00:26:40.690
2, completely;
it wins.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.538
It was that first case we saw
in Gause's Paramecia

00:26:44.538 --> 00:26:45.640
experiments.
 

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.858
The other case is where species
2 wins.

00:26:47.858 --> 00:26:50.068
The black isocline belongs to
species 2.

00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:55.297
We can tell that by remembering
to look for which axis has the

00:26:55.297 --> 00:26:56.240
K2 on it.
 

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.210
Okay?
 

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:02.115
K2 is corresponding to N2 here,
and it is above the isocline

00:27:02.115 --> 00:27:04.723
for species 1,
over the entire range of

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:07.759
possible combinations,
of mixtures of both species.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:12.021
And what basically that means
is that species 2 can grow at

00:27:12.021 --> 00:27:15.990
densities where species 1 is
declining, and it excludes

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.019
species 1.
 

00:27:17.019 --> 00:27:20.672
The more complex,
and therefore more interesting

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:22.460
cases, are down here.
 

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:26.608
This case is an unstable
equilibrium.

00:27:26.608 --> 00:27:29.568
Above the isoclines,
both species are declining.

00:27:29.568 --> 00:27:32.318
Below the isoclines,
both species are increasing.

00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:34.640
If they happen to be at this
point,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.371
it's an unstable point,
because if they just get a

00:27:37.371 --> 00:27:40.913
little bit off of it,
the system wanders off in this

00:27:40.913 --> 00:27:44.588
direction and ends up going to
be only species 2.

00:27:44.588 --> 00:27:47.144
And if it wanders a little way
off, down here,

00:27:47.144 --> 00:27:50.548
it goes off in this direction
and ends up being species 1.

00:27:50.548 --> 00:27:56.461
And over here you have the
interesting case that you have

00:27:56.461 --> 00:27:59.988
co-existence,
and that's where intra-specific

00:27:59.988 --> 00:28:03.368
competition is stronger than
inter-specific competition.

00:28:03.368 --> 00:28:07.348
And above the isoclines they
both decrease,

00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:09.130
and below the isoclines they
both increase,

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.885
and that means that the
critical thing to focus on is

00:28:12.885 --> 00:28:16.858
what's going on in these
intermediate triangles here.

00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:20.821
And if you look at where the
carrying capacities are for the

00:28:20.821 --> 00:28:23.656
individual species,
you can see that carrying

00:28:23.656 --> 00:28:25.646
capacity for 1,
in this case,

00:28:25.646 --> 00:28:29.259
is below the intersection for
2, over here.

00:28:29.259 --> 00:28:33.009
And that means that above this
point,

00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:35.700
1 is decreasing and 2 is
increasing,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:38.400
and that means that if you plot
the change in both of them,

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.538
you get a vector that points up
and to the left.

00:28:41.538 --> 00:28:45.009
Similarly here,
the vectors are pointing down

00:28:45.009 --> 00:28:47.926
to the right,
because 2 is decreasing,

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:50.878
but 1 is increasing;
1 is increasing in this

00:28:50.878 --> 00:28:53.230
direction, and 2 is decreasing
in this direction,

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.798
and that yields a vector that
points like this,

00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:58.250
which leads you to a stable
equilibrium point.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.709
And if you look at the
relationship of where the

00:29:00.709 --> 00:29:04.519
intercepts are on the axes,
basically you see that this is

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:08.773
a situation in which species 1
is being limited by its own

00:29:08.773 --> 00:29:11.441
density,
below the point at which it is

00:29:11.441 --> 00:29:14.038
being limited by the density of
species 2,

00:29:14.038 --> 00:29:17.380
and species 2 is being limited
by its own density,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.518
below the point at which it
would be limited by the density

00:29:20.518 --> 00:29:21.328
of species 1.
 

00:29:21.328 --> 00:29:24.792
And that tells us that this is
a situation in which

00:29:24.792 --> 00:29:28.740
intra-specific competition is
stronger than inter-specific

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.849
competition.
 

00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:31.460
Okay?
 

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:41.970
Now if you were faced with that
issue on an exam,

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:47.250
and I plotted N1,
N2, and I just put down two

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.458
lines like this,
and I drew K1 here,

00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:59.266
and I drew K2 here,
which of the three cases do we

00:29:59.266 --> 00:29:59.559
have?
 

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:04.609
Student:  Number two.
 

00:30:04.609 --> 00:30:05.529
Prof: Which one?
 

00:30:05.529 --> 00:30:06.660
Student:  Number two.
 

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:09.298
Prof: We have this one;
that's right.

00:30:09.298 --> 00:30:12.461
And the thing that you
immediately want to focus on is

00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:15.922
what is the relationship of the
intercept for itself to the

00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:18.068
intercept for the other species?
 

00:30:18.068 --> 00:30:21.430
And if the intercept for itself
is above that of the other

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:24.691
species, you have unstable;
and if it's below that of the

00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:26.348
other species you have stable.
 

00:30:26.348 --> 00:30:36.098
Now do any of you feel
confident that you know why this

00:30:36.098 --> 00:30:39.348
looks like that?
 

00:30:39.348 --> 00:30:41.522
If you were up here at the
board with me,

00:30:41.522 --> 00:30:44.838
how would you convince me that
I should draw the arrow in that

00:30:44.838 --> 00:30:45.599
direction?
 

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.440
Yes?
 

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.240
Student:  You could
break it down as a vector,

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.608
and you know that K2 has to be
going down.

00:30:55.608 --> 00:30:57.890
Prof: Okay,
so you could just make a sketch

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.750
and say, "Oh,
I know K2's going like

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.450
that."
 

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:03.338
Student:  And then K1 is
going to the right.

00:31:03.338 --> 00:31:05.173
Prof: Right,
because at this point it's

00:31:05.173 --> 00:31:06.640
still below its carrying
capacity.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.308
Student:  Right.
 

00:31:07.308 --> 00:31:10.201
Prof: So you would go
like that, and that's how you

00:31:10.201 --> 00:31:11.420
would get that vector.
 

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.809
Very good.
 

00:31:14.809 --> 00:31:18.338
Okay.
 

00:31:18.338 --> 00:31:20.548
So the take-home points from
this--

00:31:20.548 --> 00:31:22.708
and by the way,
I don't think the important

00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:25.689
thing about the Lotka-Volterra
equations is that they're an

00:31:25.689 --> 00:31:27.539
accurate description of reality.
 

00:31:27.539 --> 00:31:28.730
&gt;
 

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:32.250
Reality is a lot messier than
those equations.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.827
What they are is a good
analytical tool that helps you

00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:38.560
to realize that hey,
we're probably dealing with

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.827
four cases,
and there are some nice

00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:45.403
qualitative ways to simplify the
analysis of complex systems of

00:31:45.403 --> 00:31:49.682
differential equations so that
you don't have to do all the

00:31:49.682 --> 00:31:51.750
numerical calculations.
 

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.358
And if you put those equations
into something like Mathematica,

00:31:55.358 --> 00:31:57.988
on the computer,
you can draw out the vector

00:31:57.988 --> 00:32:00.038
fields,
over the entire phase space,

00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:03.118
and you'll get arrows pointing
in all possible directions,

00:32:03.118 --> 00:32:06.818
and they'll be pretty and
they'll look nice.

00:32:06.818 --> 00:32:12.460
But the essential thing is not
that pretty picture,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.808
but the general qualitative
result,

00:32:14.808 --> 00:32:17.801
and to know where things are
generally going in each parts of

00:32:17.801 --> 00:32:18.700
the phase space.
 

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.028
Okay?
 

00:32:20.028 --> 00:32:23.355
So on the one hand it's a
method of simplifying a complex

00:32:23.355 --> 00:32:26.980
reality, and on the other hand
it's a neat analytical tool;

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.808
and that's why I present it to
you.

00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:32.769
It's not necessarily the way
Nature actually works;

00:32:32.769 --> 00:32:34.119
that's another issue.
 

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:36.009
That's why we do experiments.
 

00:32:36.009 --> 00:32:40.262
Okay, so you don't really have
to be able to solve numerically

00:32:40.262 --> 00:32:43.960
a differential equation to
understand its outcomes.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:47.157
There are four outcomes in this
case: one wins,

00:32:47.157 --> 00:32:50.146
two wins, or there's an
unstable or a stable

00:32:50.146 --> 00:32:51.259
equilibrium.
 

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:55.025
And even the very simplest
analysis of competition shows

00:32:55.025 --> 00:32:59.064
that coexistence is possible
when intra-specific competition

00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:02.348
is stronger than inter-specific
competition.

00:33:02.348 --> 00:33:04.838
I'll give you an example of a
system where that works.

00:33:04.838 --> 00:33:08.615
Go to Panama,
look around on the floor of the

00:33:08.615 --> 00:33:10.588
rainforest in Panama.
 

00:33:10.588 --> 00:33:12.680
Often you'll find yourself
under a fig tree;

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.430
fig trees are very important in
rainforests.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:21.212
Each time a fig tree drops to
the ground, it is colonized by a

00:33:21.212 --> 00:33:23.108
fruit fly species.
 

00:33:23.108 --> 00:33:28.048
If a fruit fly arrives first,
at the fig, it will start to

00:33:28.048 --> 00:33:31.338
display, and then mating will go
on;

00:33:31.338 --> 00:33:35.048
it will attract other members
of its own species to that fig.

00:33:35.048 --> 00:33:39.529
However, different individual
figs, just by random chance,

00:33:39.529 --> 00:33:42.910
will attract different fruit
fly species;

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:45.348
you're just bumbling along
through the forest,

00:33:45.348 --> 00:33:47.359
buzz buzz buzz buzz,
and you hit a fig,

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:49.917
and then you say, "Hey,
I found some places for our

00:33:49.917 --> 00:33:50.720
babies to grow up.
 

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.259
Come over here and mate with
me."

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:54.009
And so, that's what happens.
 

00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:57.685
And because the resources are
discrete and they're scattered

00:33:57.685 --> 00:34:00.740
across the floor of the
Panamanian rainforest,

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.602
what you have is a
concentration of intra-specific

00:34:05.602 --> 00:34:08.579
competition within each fig.
 

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:11.342
The mating behavior attracts
more of your own species to the

00:34:11.342 --> 00:34:13.590
place where your larvae are
going to grow up,

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.059
and the larvae are competing
with each other.

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:15.849
Okay?
 

00:34:15.849 --> 00:34:20.655
So this process generates a
situation in which you get

00:34:20.655 --> 00:34:22.559
stable coexistence.
 

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:27.967
And there are about 17 species
of fruit flies that can live on

00:34:27.967 --> 00:34:31.197
the same fig tree;
the same fruit from the same

00:34:31.197 --> 00:34:33.284
fig tree,
in Panama, and it's very

00:34:33.284 --> 00:34:36.443
probably because the process
I've just described is

00:34:36.443 --> 00:34:40.233
guaranteeing that intra-specific
competition will be stronger

00:34:40.233 --> 00:34:42.570
than inter-specific competition.
 

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:45.320
So you can see that the
analysis of the Lotka-Volterra

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.329
model is giving us kind of a key
criterion to look for,

00:34:48.329 --> 00:34:53.559
that in fact is reflected in a
very complex natural situation;

00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:57.393
and it might not have occurred
to us if we hadn't been through

00:34:57.393 --> 00:35:00.409
the simplicity of the
Lotka-Volterra analysis.

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:03.329
So now I'd like to go back to
the field.

00:35:03.329 --> 00:35:05.449
And this is a habitat that I
like a lot.

00:35:05.449 --> 00:35:07.500
This is the Alpine habitat.
 

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.449
This is probably the first week
of July.

00:35:09.449 --> 00:35:12.130
You're looking at a flowering
meadow.

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:14.210
It's a complicated environment.
 

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:16.679
You've got grasses,
you've got flowering plants.

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:20.210
There are orchids coming up in
here.

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:24.880
In ten square meters you might
have 50 or 100 species.

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.449
Below the surface there are
mycorrhizae down in the soil.

00:35:28.449 --> 00:35:31.744
There are earthworms that are
splitting up the subsurface

00:35:31.744 --> 00:35:34.449
habitat into three or four
different niches;

00:35:34.449 --> 00:35:36.840
all kinds of stuff is going on
here.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:39.070
It's complicated.
 

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.806
There's a very interesting
result from plant competition

00:35:42.806 --> 00:35:46.409
experiments that have been done
by taking seeds off of

00:35:46.409 --> 00:35:49.400
individual plants in a meadow
like that.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.012
If you go in and you determine
which are the next door

00:35:53.012 --> 00:35:56.945
neighbors of a particular plant,
in that meadow--so you take one

00:35:56.945 --> 00:35:59.599
individual plant and you ask,
"Is it next to species 1,

00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:01.079
species 2, species 3?"
 

00:36:01.079 --> 00:36:04.090
Normally it's not going to have
more than three or four

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:04.760
neighbors.
 

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.307
And you take its seeds back,
and you test it against a

00:36:08.307 --> 00:36:11.590
random selection of species,
in the greenhouse.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.309
So you take its seeds,
and you ask,

00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:17.253
"Are these seeds doing the
best against the neighbors I

00:36:17.253 --> 00:36:19.976
found out there in Nature,
or just a random selection that

00:36:19.976 --> 00:36:21.500
I took out of the same
meadow?"

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.079
Okay?
 

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:26.030
And what you find is that they
do better in competition with

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.980
the neighbors than with the
average of the larger collection

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:30.630
of all species in the meadow.
 

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.786
And you ask yourself,
"Well how could that

00:36:32.786 --> 00:36:33.489
happen?"
 

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:37.489
That is something that's really
a rather remarkable pattern,

00:36:37.489 --> 00:36:42.606
because it's almost as though
they had been selected to do

00:36:42.606 --> 00:36:45.570
better against those neighbors.
 

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:46.949
But what process could do that?
 

00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:50.099
Well the answer is that there's
a seed bank,

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:54.670
and that there are seeds of
many individuals,

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:57.219
from many different species,
that are in the soil,

00:36:57.219 --> 00:36:59.449
all over that meadow,
and in the spring when they

00:36:59.449 --> 00:37:01.268
sprout out,
there's selection,

00:37:01.268 --> 00:37:04.389
and that selection is mediated
by competition,

00:37:04.389 --> 00:37:07.139
and it's acting on seedlings in
juvenile stages,

00:37:07.139 --> 00:37:09.911
and both intra- and
inter-specific competition are

00:37:09.911 --> 00:37:12.909
interacting to determine who
survives to be adults.

00:37:12.909 --> 00:37:15.478
And the ones that we see as
adults are the ones that have

00:37:15.478 --> 00:37:17.449
made it through that competition
screen,

00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:21.871
and if there were twenty or
thirty or fifty possible

00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:26.346
seedlings that were staring up,
to yield just one plant,

00:37:26.346 --> 00:37:29.210
surviving,
you can see how that pattern

00:37:29.210 --> 00:37:30.710
would be generated.
 

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.380
And so in every generation,
out in a meadow,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.880
inter-specific competition is
mediating the distribution of

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.911
the plants that we see,
and the fact that selection is

00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:46.532
effective is an indicator that
there's a lot of genetic

00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:50.960
variation within each of those
species for competitive ability.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.646
This selection couldn't work
unless there were genetic

00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:55.980
variation among individuals in
each species.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.913
So that each species consists
of a whole variety of possible

00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:01.579
competitive mechanisms.
 

00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:03.777
Some of them do well against
one neighbor,

00:38:03.777 --> 00:38:05.869
some of them do well against
another;

00:38:05.869 --> 00:38:08.867
as a result of which you get
the maintenance of quite a few

00:38:08.867 --> 00:38:11.764
different species in the meadow
and quite a few different

00:38:11.764 --> 00:38:15.309
genotypes,
within a species, both.

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:19.489
Okay, so to sum up
inter-specific competition.

00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:25.929
It really does occur.
 

00:38:25.929 --> 00:38:28.429
It does help to shape
communities in Nature;

00:38:28.429 --> 00:38:31.153
it's not the only thing shaping
communities in Nature,

00:38:31.153 --> 00:38:33.519
but it's one of the things that
shapes them.

00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:35.889
And it is often asymmetric.
 

00:38:35.889 --> 00:38:41.010
So often you have a situation
where the bully wins.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:43.219
It's frequently been
demonstrated,

00:38:43.219 --> 00:38:45.871
both in field and in lab,
and the best way to demonstrate

00:38:45.871 --> 00:38:48.856
it in the field is to remove one
species and see what happens to

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:49.519
the other.
 

00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:55.318
There is an analytical
framework called the

00:38:55.318 --> 00:38:58.197
Lotka-Volterra model,
that helps us to understand and

00:38:58.197 --> 00:39:00.518
pull together the results of
these experiments,

00:39:00.518 --> 00:39:04.518
and it points us to a key
conclusion.

00:39:04.518 --> 00:39:10.530
And the key conclusion is that
you'll get coexistence when

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:16.541
intra-specific competition is
stronger than inter-specific

00:39:16.541 --> 00:39:18.230
competition.
 

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.927
This kind of model,
and others, predict that both

00:39:20.927 --> 00:39:23.849
competitive exclusion and
competitive coexistence are

00:39:23.849 --> 00:39:26.380
possible, depending on the
circumstances.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.467
And so it was probably a
mistake to enunciate the

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:33.456
competitive exclusion principle
as something that must apply at

00:39:33.456 --> 00:39:36.030
all times in all places in
ecology,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.304
because under the particular
circumstance of strong

00:39:39.304 --> 00:39:43.630
intra-specific competition,
coexistence is possible;

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.369
exclusion is not the only
logical outcome.

00:39:47.369 --> 00:39:50.289
Okay, next time predation,
disease;

00:39:50.289 --> 00:39:52.358
and I'm going to be very
interested to see what you do

00:39:52.358 --> 00:39:52.750
with it.

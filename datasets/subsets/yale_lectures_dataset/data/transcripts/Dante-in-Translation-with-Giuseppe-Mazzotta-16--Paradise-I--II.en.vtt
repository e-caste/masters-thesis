00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:06.783
Prof: We begin with
Paradise,

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:12.694
which clearly is different from
the earthly paradise,

00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:14.740
two paradises.
 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.864
We went through the earthly
paradise, this is--anyway,

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:23.690
we begin the third canticle
which is called Paradise.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.319
As you read,
you'll find that Dante uses a

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.140
Ptolemaic structure of the
cosmos.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.980
A Ptolemaic structure means
that for him,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.837
as for Ptolemy,
the earth is at the center of

00:00:43.837 --> 00:00:47.662
the universe,
unmoved, immobile,

00:00:47.662 --> 00:00:56.140
and there are a number of seven
planets that circle around it.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.740
The Moon is thought of as a
planet, Mercury,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.664
then Sun, and then there will
be Mars, Jupiter,

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:07.269
and Saturn.
 

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:13.497
Beyond that there is this--the
Heaven of a so-called Fixed

00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:17.430
Stars and beyond that the
Primum--

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.959
the Empyrean,
the heaven of fire,

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:27.480
from which all motion begins,
from which time starts.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.489
That's really where the roots
of time are found and they

00:01:34.489 --> 00:01:39.080
stretch out into the finite
world;

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.682
so that we really are in the
shadows of the leaves of time,

00:01:45.682 --> 00:01:51.260
which means that they are
always falling and being

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.739
replaced.
 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:59.119
Another thing we have to keep
in mind as you go into Paradise

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.552
is that Dante links the--
each of the planets with--I

00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:09.020
have said this before,
I know, but it bears repeating,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.139
with one of the liberal arts.
 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.508
And they're respectively,
the liberal arts are the seven

00:02:15.508 --> 00:02:20.355
liberal arts and then there are
two more, since there are nine

00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:21.310
heavens.
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.930
It begins with grammar in the
planet of the Moon and so you

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.581
have to expect that you will
find the language of

00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:36.126
grammarians,
grammar--the Moon and grammar

00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:41.319
the--a very wide definition of
what grammar can be.

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.684
It includes poetry;
it includes history,

00:02:43.684 --> 00:02:46.050
it even includes some
rhetorical tropes.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.489
And then the Heaven of Mercury
with dialectics and so you're

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.113
expecting to find the language
of dialectics deployed and it's

00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:00.688
going to be the--
deployed throughout the canto.

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:05.301
The Heaven of Venus and
rhetoric, that probably is the

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:08.610
least surprising,
eros and rhetoric.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.050
They have an old kinship;
they seem to entail each other.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.169
Then the Heaven of Mars,
the god of war,

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:23.188
which here Dante couples with
music in the persuasion that

00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:28.258
music is a harmony made of
discordant parts.

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:33.501
So that there is this kind of
simultaneously a pull and a

00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:38.650
strife within the Heaven of
Mars, so that when music.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.191
Then beyond it there's geometry
linked with the temperateness of

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.758
Jupiter and beyond it astronomy
of Saturn.

00:03:49.758 --> 00:03:55.750
The Heaven of the Fixed Stars
is tied--is linked to ethics.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.076
Whereas, the Heaven of the
Empyrean is really the heaven of

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:04.627
metaphysics as Dante will call
it and you will see the kind of

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:08.210
interesting arguments that Dante
will have,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.527
because in effect he has
changed his mind when writing

00:04:11.527 --> 00:04:14.908
the philosophical text known as
the Banquet,

00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:17.482
as you know now Il
Convivio,

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:19.449
he writes it in Italian.
 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.115
He had really claimed that
ethics is the first of--and the

00:04:24.115 --> 00:04:26.490
most important of the arts.
 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.129
It's really the discipline
toward which all the art,

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.413
to which all the other arts are
subordinated and toward which

00:04:34.413 --> 00:04:35.769
they all point.
 

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:40.021
When Dante writes the
Paradiso he has changed

00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:43.934
his mind about that,
though he also knows that in

00:04:43.934 --> 00:04:47.139
many ways you cannot quite
separate ethics,

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.141
whatever he means by ethics,
with some theory about how the

00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:51.899
world is.
 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.862
They really are inseparable and
Dante will go on back and forth

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:03.439
in re-configuring the relation
of those two disciplines.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:08.449
The other thing that I should
mention before we go on,

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.199
is that much of the
Paradiso really is going

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:19.490
to come through as a way of-- as
a teaching.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.970
It's already implied that this
should be the thrust of

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.286
Paradiso,
by the very idea that there is

00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:29.009
the disposition of the arts and
sciences in--

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.233
through Paradiso,
which means that the journey

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:33.810
that Dante will have--
this cosmological journey.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.120
It's an interplanetary journey.
 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.514
He goes from planet to
planet--is already an

00:05:39.514 --> 00:05:43.199
educational journey,
that's how he goes through

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.468
grammar,
rhetoric, dialectic,

00:05:45.468 --> 00:05:50.112
etc., etc., until he reaches
metaphysics or beyond that there

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:51.660
will be theology.
 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.879
It's literally an educational
journey.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:01.776
This is already understood,
also it's already carried out

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:06.850
by the focus on the teaching
that Beatrice will deliver.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.971
I have to say a couple of
things, that Dante's teacher in

00:06:09.971 --> 00:06:13.084
Paradiso,
and this is an innovative,

00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:17.507
very imaginative and highly
unusual move on the part of a

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:20.307
poet,
is not some kind of abstract

00:06:20.307 --> 00:06:22.620
matron called Dame Philosophy.
 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.560
It's not some kind of allegory
of nature.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.829
You do have this kind of
allegorical--

00:06:27.829 --> 00:06:32.959
didactic allegories where
nature appears as larger than

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:37.529
disheveled woman,
wounded, because nature has

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.783
fallen,
teaching the pilgrim of the

00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:49.629
traveler about the secrets of
nature and the wealth of nature.

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.430
Here is a personal--his
girlfriend to be sure,

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.620
and it's someone who
really--who also replaces all

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.399
the other likely candidates for
this teaching which is--

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.980
would be Aquinas,
Boethius, Bonaventure,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.500
all figures that he's going to
meet.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.230
It's a mistake to believe,
however,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.930
that, as some great scholars of
Dante have said in the past,

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.769
that Paradiso is really
a journey to be Beatrice.

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:19.829
That's what they had said.
 

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:24.240
That's not the case because
Beatrice will disappear from--

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.387
she will still be within view
up to a point in Paradise her

00:07:29.387 --> 00:07:34.357
role ends with Canto XXX of
Paradiso and from that

00:07:34.357 --> 00:07:36.846
point on,
a mystic by the name of

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:40.326
Bernard, a historical figure,
Bernard of Clairvaux,

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.779
will take place.
 

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:45.819
So this leads me now to a
further clarification.

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.682
There may be the tendency in
some of you to view the

00:07:49.682 --> 00:07:53.622
Paradiso as some kind of
account of a mystical

00:07:53.622 --> 00:07:54.759
experience.
 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:58.678
You know what I'm saying,
that Dante sort of goes beyond

00:07:58.678 --> 00:08:01.728
his own self,
beyond any idea of rational

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:05.807
understanding of the world,
the surrendering of his own

00:08:05.807 --> 00:08:09.189
subjectivity to some insight
into the whole.

00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:12.139
This, I don't think that this
is what's happening here.

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:16.288
Dante will preserve his
rationality and his sense of

00:08:16.288 --> 00:08:21.168
distinction and separation from
some kind of cosmological and

00:08:21.168 --> 00:08:23.689
cosmical hall the very end.
 

00:08:23.689 --> 00:08:27.341
There is a way in which Dante
will deploy the language of the

00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.750
mystics and I want to give you
some evidence of that,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.902
because I think it opens up an
interesting chapter for your

00:08:33.902 --> 00:08:37.538
further readings,
but it's not--this is not to be

00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:42.553
read as a kind of transcription
of a mystical experience where

00:08:42.553 --> 00:08:47.485
the text then goes on in some
kind of random approximation or

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:51.432
random copying of what the
mystic saw and becomes

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.830
ineffable.
 

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:56.355
Dante uses, occasionally,
toward the end the language of

00:08:56.355 --> 00:09:00.548
ineffability but this is--
remains a poetic construction,

00:09:00.548 --> 00:09:05.024
an imaginative projection into
what is a journey into the

00:09:05.024 --> 00:09:09.821
absolute unknown into a space no
other imagination had really

00:09:09.821 --> 00:09:13.500
traveled and it's those--
and have been those who have

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.245
traveled there but they never
really took-- came back to tell

00:09:16.245 --> 00:09:16.519
us.
 

00:09:16.519 --> 00:09:18.240
Dante will play with that.
 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.215
His is, to use that language,
a kind of--a way of getting

00:09:23.215 --> 00:09:28.190
into that which had been left
inarticulate and silent.

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:34.022
It's really largely a battle
against the--for a poet,

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:38.058
threatening boundaries of
silence.

00:09:38.058 --> 00:09:45.623
Something that threatens him
with defeat, he will not be able

00:09:45.623 --> 00:09:47.009
to speak.
 

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:51.822
And from one point of view that
defeat for the Christian would

00:09:51.822 --> 00:09:56.634
also be of course a victory but
Dante is suspended between the

00:09:56.634 --> 00:09:57.740
two poles.
 

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.653
If I had to define,
and I have already given a kind

00:10:00.653 --> 00:10:03.910
of general definition,
what kind of aegis,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:09.412
under which rubric should we
try to go on reading this part

00:10:09.412 --> 00:10:14.381
of the poem,
I really think this is really a

00:10:14.381 --> 00:10:18.990
poem about beauty,
in the sense that Dante will

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.220
try to understand what the
beauty is.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:26.620
The beauty is the visibility
of--Plotinus says this,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.298
it's the visibility of being,
he calls it,

00:10:29.298 --> 00:10:33.105
being life, the whole of life
becomes visible only because we

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:35.960
have perceptions and images of
it so it's--

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.830
I think that Dante's trying to
see that,

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.990
to explore what is it that lies
beyond that which we see.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:48.740
What is this beauty skin deep,
as it were,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.559
because that's really one of
the dangers of focusing on

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:54.120
beauty that it's really the
surface of things,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.460
the appearance of things.
 

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:59.504
And he will go between
appearances, images,

00:10:59.504 --> 00:11:04.899
and the idea that they are
essences lying beyond them.

00:11:04.899 --> 00:11:10.797
I really have said more or less
all I had to say in the mode of

00:11:10.797 --> 00:11:12.509
an introduction.
 

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:16.720
I immediately get into Canto I.
 

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.080
Let me just read Canto I a
little bit with--

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.666
in some detail,
"The glory,"

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:29.932
that's the way it starts,
"The glory of Him who

00:11:29.932 --> 00:11:36.020
moves all things penetrates the
universe and shines in one part

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.360
more and in another less."
 

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.745
That's the first tercet,
famous first tercet and I will

00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:51.126
read this in Italian so that you
sense how even the rhythm of the

00:11:51.126 --> 00:11:53.918
poem completely changes.
 

00:11:53.918 --> 00:11:57.160
The rhythm and even the
syntactical structure of the

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.721
poem,
because you may recall and I

00:11:59.721 --> 00:12:03.678
say this knowing that you have
already noticed that,

00:12:03.678 --> 00:12:07.392
that if you read Canto I of
Inferno or Canto I of

00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:10.652
Purgatorio,
the two exordiums of the other

00:12:10.652 --> 00:12:13.534
canticles,
you know that the poet is

00:12:13.534 --> 00:12:18.340
immediately casting himself into
the role of the agent.

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.476
"In the middle of the
journey of my life I found

00:12:22.476 --> 00:12:25.976
myself,"
that's really the very start of

00:12:25.976 --> 00:12:29.620
Inferno I,
and in Purgatorio too,

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:33.678
"To course over a better
waters the ship--

00:12:33.678 --> 00:12:36.977
the boat of my genius now goes
and I will sing,"

00:12:36.977 --> 00:12:37.929
you remember?
 

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:39.710
Not so in Paradise.
 

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:41.620
There is a way in which,
immediately,

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.543
the first tercet,
which has a sort of proemial

00:12:45.543 --> 00:12:48.475
value,
seeks to bracket the idea of

00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:51.769
the self and the idea of the
subjectivity.

00:12:51.769 --> 00:12:57.090
It emphasizes the question
of--God becomes the agent here,

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.298
to say it in a very direct--as
directly as he says,

00:13:00.298 --> 00:13:02.918
"The glory,"
it's a circumlocution once

00:13:02.918 --> 00:13:05.380
again,
but let me read it in Italian,

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.845
so that I can give you a sense,
as I said, of the new music

00:13:09.845 --> 00:13:11.460
that he has found.
 

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:15.493
The new sense of the inner
harmony that toward which

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:17.470
language has to strive.
 

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:21.350
La gloria di colui che tutto
move

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.278
per l'universo penetra e
risplende

00:13:24.278 --> 00:13:28.570
in una parte più
e meno altrove.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.110
It's rendered very faithfully
by Sinclair.

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:35.808
I don't know the other
translations but probably it

00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:39.053
can't deviate from it very much,
and I read it in Italian

00:13:39.053 --> 00:13:42.264
because also--
and this is understandable to

00:13:42.264 --> 00:13:45.232
the eye,
if not just to the ear for you,

00:13:45.232 --> 00:13:47.947
how he's playing with--
in line one,

00:13:47.947 --> 00:13:51.788
"The glory of him who all
moves."

00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:55.365
So God the mover I'll talk
about it in--later on,

00:13:55.365 --> 00:13:59.984
the one who moves all and that
all then becomes one in the next

00:13:59.984 --> 00:14:01.399
line, universe.
 

00:14:01.399 --> 00:14:04.575
The all becomes that which is
turned into one,

00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:07.610
that's what etymologically--the
universe.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:13.518
It goes on, "Penetrates
the universe and shines in one

00:14:13.518 --> 00:14:17.389
part more and in another
less."

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:27.330
Well the tercet casts God--this
is about God,

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.928
as a circumlocution,
it is not--it's really a God

00:14:30.928 --> 00:14:33.929
who is visible through God's
effects,

00:14:33.929 --> 00:14:36.798
as God appears as kind of cause.
 

00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:39.147
Now then, if you really
understand the effects,

00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:40.779
it means there is a causality.
 

00:14:40.779 --> 00:14:43.537
I don't want to get into--too
much into that but you know what

00:14:43.537 --> 00:14:44.874
I mean,
that--simple,

00:14:44.874 --> 00:14:47.929
you only know the effects,
you know the glory,

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:50.168
we see the glory which is the
light.

00:14:50.168 --> 00:14:54.726
Glory, it's a semantic--the
first thing we have to say,

00:14:54.726 --> 00:14:58.610
this is a shift,
a change in the history of the

00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.370
word.
 

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.417
That's what poets do,
that poets invent,

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:05.370
reinvent language;
that's largely what they do.

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:07.230
They change the meaning of
words.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:11.599
Glory, in the classical time
and all the way down to the

00:15:11.599 --> 00:15:15.808
Renaissance and the Romantic
age, glory means fame.

00:15:15.808 --> 00:15:17.860
It means, it's the child of
Clio.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.148
It means, it's the power we
have to survive,

00:15:21.148 --> 00:15:25.812
not to have a posthumous life
because of whatever noble deeds,

00:15:25.812 --> 00:15:28.029
heroes may have achieved.
 

00:15:28.029 --> 00:15:29.480
That's not what it means here.
 

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.639
Glory means light, of course.
 

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:34.331
It's the light who wants fame,
if you wish,

00:15:34.331 --> 00:15:35.299
but this is the light.
 

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:37.019
Why do we know that?
 

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:40.461
Because light now is linked to
two verbs of the "glory of

00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:41.139
Him who...
 

00:15:41.139 --> 00:15:43.283
all things,"
who moves all things,

00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:45.428
penetrates the universe,
and shines.

00:15:45.428 --> 00:15:49.820
You see there is a metaphor of
light that is conveyed here.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:55.596
So the first tercet presents
God in a cosmological role which

00:15:55.596 --> 00:16:00.990
is double: one of motion and one
of light, two things.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:06.455
Dante is combining an
Aristotelian idea of God as the

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:11.918
prime mover, one who imparts
motion to all things.

00:16:11.918 --> 00:16:16.953
And in the second image is that
God as the principle of light,

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:18.769
a neo-Platonic idea.
 

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.673
He's fusing together two
contradictory,

00:16:21.673 --> 00:16:26.028
apparently contradictory,
traditions: light and motion.

00:16:26.028 --> 00:16:29.856
One is talking in terms of
causality and the other one

00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:32.123
really--
I'm not going to go much

00:16:32.123 --> 00:16:34.817
further than this,
the other one in terms

00:16:34.817 --> 00:16:39.682
of--because light does that,
penetrates, shines all over,

00:16:39.682 --> 00:16:45.360
according to a principle of
hierarchy: more and less.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.794
There is no uniformity in--with
light, and I'll come back to

00:16:49.794 --> 00:16:51.750
this notion in a moment.
 

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:56.240
One idea casts God as the prime
mover,

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.649
according to the tradition of
Aristotelian philosophy,

00:16:59.649 --> 00:17:03.490
the other one thinks of God as
in the mode of light or

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.650
participation.
 

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.140
They are two different
theological modes.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.140
God participates,
is part of creation,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.519
the natural world is part of
the supernatural world.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:21.127
There is not just a causality
that begins all things and then

00:17:21.127 --> 00:17:28.067
somehow retreats in some sort of
invisible and unknown non-space

00:17:28.067 --> 00:17:29.828
of its soul.
 

00:17:29.828 --> 00:17:34.202
The other item in this first
tercet is that of the--that I

00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:38.039
want to emphasize is the
principle of hierarchy.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:40.450
Light shines more and less.
 

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:43.825
I have been hinting at this,
that this is really a great

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:46.710
problem for Dante in other parts
of the poem.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.800
You remember "to course
over better waters,"

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.960
Dante says in Purgatorio
I,

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.710
and that implies of course that
there are bad,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.556
good, better,
best--that we are in the

00:17:57.556 --> 00:17:59.480
principle of hierarchy.
 

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:04.666
Differences are very crucial
for Dante because they allow us

00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:07.756
to know things,
only through differences,

00:18:07.756 --> 00:18:10.945
and also the--
because these differences--and

00:18:10.945 --> 00:18:13.308
that's the value of hierarchy.
 

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:19.240
They are still combined in some
kind of unified structure.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.513
Hierarchy is a structure that
unifies all differences

00:18:22.513 --> 00:18:24.970
according to the principle of
degree.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.640
More of this a little bit
later, as we go on.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.461
Then Dante now,
as I said, that he's not a

00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:33.299
mystic.
 

00:18:33.299 --> 00:18:36.140
Subjectivity is not erased.
 

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:39.738
Mystics tend--though they all
claim a unique vision,

00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:44.041
they all end up resembling each
other when they talk about the

00:18:44.041 --> 00:18:45.029
ineffable.
 

00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:48.230
And Dante introduces now the
subject and he says,

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.430
"I was in the heaven that
most receives His light."

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:57.317
That is to say passed in the
Empyrean, which is sort of

00:18:57.317 --> 00:19:03.021
spiritual, he as close to God as
he could be, which will also be

00:19:03.021 --> 00:19:06.009
as far from God as it can be.
 

00:19:06.009 --> 00:19:10.381
"I was in the heaven that
most receives His light and I

00:19:10.381 --> 00:19:14.232
saw things which he that
descends from it has not the

00:19:14.232 --> 00:19:17.788
knowledge nor the power to tell
again."

00:19:17.788 --> 00:19:25.834
No sooner does Dante introduce
his subjectivity and his way of

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:30.450
knowing out of this intimacy
of--

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:34.710
and closeness to the beatific
vision,

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.970
then he has also to cast
himself as a visionary,

00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:40.568
has "the knowledge or the
power to tell.

00:19:40.568 --> 00:19:43.884
I saw things,"
and you will see how Dante goes

00:19:43.884 --> 00:19:48.019
on refining his eyesight,
a little detail that you might

00:19:48.019 --> 00:19:52.730
really enjoy is that we do know
that Dante would use lenses--

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.558
glasses toward the end of
the--had just been invented.

00:19:56.558 --> 00:20:00.045
There are books written about
when were glasses invented,

00:20:00.045 --> 00:20:01.849
were they invented in Pisa?
 

00:20:01.849 --> 00:20:03.490
Were they invented in Padua?
 

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:06.931
There have been wars going on
about this claim,

00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:09.847
but Dante uses glasses,
so he really had

00:20:09.847 --> 00:20:13.140
difficulty--that's the point--in
seeing.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.669
All of Paradiso is about
the refinement of sight and the

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:19.348
refinement of vision.
 

00:20:19.348 --> 00:20:23.577
How you are going to be able to
attune as it were your eyes to

00:20:23.577 --> 00:20:25.308
the objects around you.
 

00:20:25.308 --> 00:20:28.520
Anyway he casts himself now as
a visionary with an internal

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.019
vision.
 

00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.450
I'm not casting him as a Homer
who is blind,

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.318
and therefore he sees
everything with the inner eye,

00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:38.328
but he wants to be a visionary
poet,

00:20:38.328 --> 00:20:40.766
and "I saw things
which," that is to say one

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:42.098
who sees things as a whole.
 

00:20:42.098 --> 00:20:45.358
That's the difference between
ear,

00:20:45.358 --> 00:20:49.905
there are great debates between
the ear and the eye is that the

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:53.932
ear you hear,
and you hear always--only from

00:20:53.932 --> 00:20:55.930
one in a linear way.
 

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.355
Things can come from all sides
but you can only catch a thing

00:20:59.355 --> 00:21:00.038
at a time.
 

00:21:00.038 --> 00:21:03.480
With the eye you have--the eye
is the organ that gives you the

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.019
chance to--the organ of the
contemplatives;

00:21:06.019 --> 00:21:09.190
it gives you a chance to see
totalities.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:12.617
"I saw things which he
that has the sense from it has

00:21:12.617 --> 00:21:15.926
now the knowledge or the power
to tell again and then he

00:21:15.926 --> 00:21:16.950
explains why.
 

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:20.318
He explains the status of his
poetic language.

00:21:20.318 --> 00:21:23.824
"I saw what is the
relationship between language

00:21:23.824 --> 00:21:24.700
and vision?
 

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.210
That's the--if you want to put
it in a very abstract way,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.838
how are the two related?
 

00:21:29.838 --> 00:21:32.663
"For our intellect,
drawing near to its

00:21:32.663 --> 00:21:33.779
desire..."
 

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:38.846
The intellect yearns,
longs for the objects that it

00:21:38.846 --> 00:21:39.858
desires.
 

00:21:39.858 --> 00:21:42.019
So there is a desire of the
mind, a desire--

00:21:42.019 --> 00:21:44.548
it's not just a desire for the
intellectual,

00:21:44.548 --> 00:21:47.444
"desire,
sinks so deep that memory

00:21:47.444 --> 00:21:49.348
cannot follow it."
 

00:21:49.348 --> 00:21:52.674
Very simple,
forgetfulness intervenes so

00:21:52.674 --> 00:21:57.450
that the--he may have intuition,
and insight into things,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.519
he cannot quite go on
recalling.

00:22:00.519 --> 00:22:03.480
"Nevertheless,
so much of the holy kingdom,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:07.324
as I was able to treasure in my
mind shall now be matter of my

00:22:07.324 --> 00:22:08.269
song."
 

00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:13.964
Whatever he's going to tell us
is literally a shadow of things

00:22:13.964 --> 00:22:16.298
he manages to remember.
 

00:22:16.298 --> 00:22:20.220
It makes sense that he should
not remember because part--one

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.272
of the paradoxes of this poetic
construction is the following,

00:22:24.272 --> 00:22:26.200
he has a beatific vision.
 

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.557
How can he retain in his mind
this sight, which is finite,

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:32.470
that which is infinite?
 

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.068
If not through vestiges and if
not through shadows?

00:22:37.068 --> 00:22:41.848
How can you--how can my memory
which is a metaphor of time,

00:22:41.848 --> 00:22:45.118
by definition,
he remembers certain things,

00:22:45.118 --> 00:22:49.070
but how can I go on remembering
and holding that which is

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.568
without time,
which is infinite?

00:22:51.568 --> 00:22:56.740
So the first paradox of--in the
representation of Paradise.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:01.025
Let me go on with the next one,
next paragraph now,

00:23:01.025 --> 00:23:04.538
Dante turns to god of poets,
to Apollo.

00:23:04.538 --> 00:23:09.116
"O good Apollo,
for the last labor make me such

00:23:09.116 --> 00:23:11.808
a vessel of thy power."
 

00:23:11.808 --> 00:23:16.969
He casts himself into a passive
mode, a vessel,

00:23:16.969 --> 00:23:19.099
one who receives.
 

00:23:19.099 --> 00:23:23.430
It's the language of restraint.
 

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:25.400
It's a language of holding back.
 

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:32.108
It's in a sense it's really the
classical commonplace of asking

00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:35.680
the muse to breathe through us.
 

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.490
"Sing to me o muse,"
remember?

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.147
The Iliad,
and a variant of the same

00:23:42.147 --> 00:23:46.503
thing--a variation of the same
thing happens in the

00:23:46.503 --> 00:23:48.160
Odyssey.
 

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.461
"For the last labor make
me such a vessel of thy power as

00:23:52.461 --> 00:23:56.410
thou requirest for the gift of
thy loved laurel."

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.220
What an extraordinary image.
 

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.749
He was remembering the story of
the god who chases Daphne,

00:24:01.749 --> 00:24:05.338
the object of his desire,
which he cannot really obtain.

00:24:05.338 --> 00:24:09.190
That's the story--you all know
the story in the Metamorphosis.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:14.328
He can only obtain Daphne,
which means laurel in Greek,

00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:19.971
but he only can obtain this
young maiden Daphne in the form

00:24:19.971 --> 00:24:23.568
of a metaphor for the laurel
crown.

00:24:23.568 --> 00:24:28.898
So it's a sort of journey which
somehow the object of which

00:24:28.898 --> 00:24:32.007
becomes--
the possession of the object

00:24:32.007 --> 00:24:35.380
becomes dislocated,
not quite what the god himself

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.173
wanted,
but this introduces something

00:24:38.173 --> 00:24:40.660
else about the Paradiso.
 

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.522
"Thus far,
the one peak of Parnassus has

00:24:43.522 --> 00:24:44.630
sufficed."
 

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.714
You may remember this is a
recall of the dream of Parnassus

00:24:48.714 --> 00:24:52.942
in Purgatorio that we saw
when Statius and Virgil were

00:24:52.942 --> 00:24:57.239
flattered into believing that
what they had dreamt is actually

00:24:57.239 --> 00:25:00.410
the simulacrum of the earthly
paradise.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.278
Thus far, the one peak of
Parnassus has sufficed me,

00:25:03.278 --> 00:25:06.362
but now I have need of
both," a language of

00:25:06.362 --> 00:25:09.377
humility,
"entering on the arena

00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:11.029
that remains."
 

00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:13.210
There's a struggle now.
 

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.373
First of all,
he had introduced this image of

00:25:16.373 --> 00:25:20.828
himself as a vessel receptive to
the inspiration of Apollo,

00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:23.271
now the language of even
violence "on the

00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.278
arena" where there is
sports,

00:25:25.278 --> 00:25:29.990
where battles are fought,
enter into the arena--

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.990
now entering "on the arena
that remains"

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.433
and now look at this,
"Come into my breast and

00:25:35.433 --> 00:25:39.683
breathe there as when thou
drewest Marsyas from the

00:25:39.683 --> 00:25:44.700
scabbard of his limbs,"
an echo of the struggle between

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:46.910
the poet and the god.
 

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.410
He does not want to be like
Marsyas because Marsyas,

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:55.107
out of presumption--now you
understand the language of

00:25:55.107 --> 00:26:00.155
restraint and withholding--
out of presumption,

00:26:00.155 --> 00:26:04.848
Marsyas had tried to outdo
Apollo,

00:26:04.848 --> 00:26:08.388
and, of course,
was defeated by Apollo and

00:26:08.388 --> 00:26:10.028
flayed by Apollo.
 

00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:14.534
Dante does not want to--what
this is about the fear in the

00:26:14.534 --> 00:26:19.195
battle for the description of
Paradise, the fear that he may

00:26:19.195 --> 00:26:21.328
be usurping God's role.
 

00:26:21.328 --> 00:26:26.587
The fear that he may be
transgressing and violating that

00:26:26.587 --> 00:26:30.700
which is the sovereign claim of
the gods.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.227
So he continues now:
"O power divine,"

00:26:34.227 --> 00:26:38.130
so that's one of the images of
fear of blasphemy,

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.548
fear of transgression,
and this will continue.

00:26:40.548 --> 00:26:43.108
Remember the possibility of
hubris, in other words.

00:26:43.108 --> 00:26:45.298
And then it continues,
"O power divine,

00:26:45.298 --> 00:26:48.476
if thou grant me so much of thy
self that I may show forth the

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:51.338
shadow of the blessed kingdom
imprinted in my brain,

00:26:51.338 --> 00:26:55.192
thou shalt see me come to thy
chosen tree,"

00:26:55.192 --> 00:26:58.057
of laurel,
"and crown myself then

00:26:58.057 --> 00:27:01.854
with those leaves of which the
theme and thou will make me

00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:02.519
worthy.
 

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:05.651
So seldom, father,
are they gathered for triumph

00:27:05.651 --> 00:27:09.150
of Caesar or of poet--
fault and shame of human

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.425
wills--that Peneian bow must
beget gladness in the glad

00:27:13.425 --> 00:27:16.990
Delphic god when it makes any
long for it.

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:21.240
A great flame follows a little
spark," etc.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:28.179
And then, "The lamp of the
world"--I'll just give you

00:27:28.179 --> 00:27:32.880
this--Dante is approaching,
he's moving.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:41.127
He thinks he's on earth and he
discovers--I will not go on into

00:27:41.127 --> 00:27:46.848
details--he's in the Heaven--of
the Moon.

00:27:46.848 --> 00:27:50.442
So he describes here,
this is the image at the bottom

00:27:50.442 --> 00:27:52.643
of page 21,
line 65 and following:

00:27:52.643 --> 00:27:55.952
"Beatrice stood with her
eyes fixed only on the eternal

00:27:55.952 --> 00:27:58.410
wheels,
and on her I fixed mine

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:00.170
withdrawn from above.
 

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.580
At her aspect,
I was changed within as was

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:08.656
Glaucus when he tasted of the
herb that made him one among the

00:28:08.656 --> 00:28:11.318
other gods in the sea."
 

00:28:11.318 --> 00:28:15.766
It's a story of--clearly the
pilgrim is moving into another

00:28:15.766 --> 00:28:19.140
level of experience and a level
of being,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.476
and he remarks on the
transformation that he is

00:28:22.476 --> 00:28:23.420
undergoing.
 

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:27.490
The emphasis falls--and the
distance between--

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:32.694
the Ovidian account of Glaucus
who believes that he's immortal

00:28:32.694 --> 00:28:37.558
and jumps into the water of the
tasting of some herbs,

00:28:37.558 --> 00:28:42.371
and Dante himself has indicated
by that little preposition

00:28:42.371 --> 00:28:43.298
'within.'
 

00:28:43.298 --> 00:28:48.082
The transformation occurs in
Dante from within himself not in

00:28:48.082 --> 00:28:51.509
some literal way outside--on the
outside.

00:28:51.509 --> 00:28:54.836
Then he continues,
"The passing beyond the

00:28:54.836 --> 00:28:57.730
humanity cannot be set forth in
words;

00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.440
let the examples suffice,
therefore, for him to whom

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.950
grace reserves the
experience."

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:09.578
The experience the pilgrim is
having is unique and

00:29:09.578 --> 00:29:13.506
irreducible,
and the poem can only be read

00:29:13.506 --> 00:29:18.356
as an example,
as an account of what has

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:20.598
happened to him.
 

00:29:20.598 --> 00:29:22.914
Then he continues,
"If I was only that part

00:29:22.914 --> 00:29:25.498
of me which Thou createdst last,
Thou knowest,

00:29:25.498 --> 00:29:30.000
Love that rules the heavens,
who with Thy light didst raise

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:30.838
me."
 

00:29:30.838 --> 00:29:36.781
Your notes, your footnotes will
tell you that this is a

00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:42.173
reference to the Second Letter
to the Corinthians,

00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:45.145
Chapter XII,
by Paul, by St.

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:51.637
Paul, where he also tells the
story of his being rapt to the

00:29:51.637 --> 00:29:53.950
third heaven.
 

00:29:53.950 --> 00:30:01.659
We have then two accounts in
Canto I of experiences--one is

00:30:01.659 --> 00:30:06.710
that--of encounters with the
divine.

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:11.038
One is that of the profanation
by Marsyas and the other one is

00:30:11.038 --> 00:30:11.463
by St.
 

00:30:11.463 --> 00:30:14.942
Paul, who as you recall,
Dante casts as one of the

00:30:14.942 --> 00:30:17.000
possible models for him.
 

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.871
He says, when at the beginning
he has to set out on a journey,

00:30:19.871 --> 00:30:22.318
he says, "I'm not Aeneas,
I'm not Paul."

00:30:22.318 --> 00:30:24.413
Now we see how Paul comes into
play.

00:30:24.413 --> 00:30:25.368
Who am I then?
 

00:30:25.368 --> 00:30:27.490
That was the whole thrust of
the poem.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.548
What happens to Paul?
 

00:30:28.548 --> 00:30:32.759
Paul goes to the third heaven
and people have a way of--had a

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:36.477
way in the Middle Ages
especially, so how many heavens

00:30:36.477 --> 00:30:37.460
are there?
 

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:41.383
The third heaven--what is meant
by the third heaven was the

00:30:41.383 --> 00:30:42.940
third mode of vision.
 

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.058
There are levels of vision that
they emphasize.

00:30:46.058 --> 00:30:50.529
There is a literal level,
the carnal worldly level.

00:30:50.529 --> 00:30:55.250
There's an imaginative vision,
and then there is the ecstatic

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:57.058
vision that Paul had.
 

00:30:57.058 --> 00:30:58.980
The thing is,
in the Second Letter to the

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:01.760
Corinthians,
is that Paul went to the third

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:04.555
heaven,
had the vision of God,

00:31:04.555 --> 00:31:09.828
the beatific vision,
he returned and could not speak

00:31:09.828 --> 00:31:13.690
about it,
because what he saw had to be

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:16.068
kept wrapped in silence.
 

00:31:16.068 --> 00:31:20.461
This is now--Dante is between,
on the one hand Marsyas and

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:23.618
that fear of profanation,
and now Paul.

00:31:23.618 --> 00:31:27.347
It is as if he also is
transgressing the teaching of

00:31:27.347 --> 00:31:27.858
Paul.
 

00:31:27.858 --> 00:31:32.002
The whole of Paradise is
about limits and the

00:31:32.002 --> 00:31:35.660
impossibility of establishing
clear limits.

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.509
He will do what Paul himself
could not do.

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:45.088
Paul kept quiet in the belief
that the silence was the proper

00:31:45.088 --> 00:31:48.529
language of his sublime
experience.

00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:52.597
Dante will go on speaking until
it's possible for him to do

00:31:52.597 --> 00:31:57.018
so--until finally he really has
forgotten everything that he has

00:31:57.018 --> 00:31:57.650
seen.
 

00:31:57.650 --> 00:31:59.529
You see how he is casting
himself?

00:31:59.529 --> 00:32:03.230
His own poetic powers,
his own subjectivity between

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.230
two different modalities.
 

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.371
He doesn't want to go as
presumptuously far as Marsyas

00:32:09.371 --> 00:32:09.838
did.
 

00:32:09.838 --> 00:32:15.108
He does not want to retreat as
Paul did.

00:32:15.108 --> 00:32:18.814
I really think that I should
let you know--;it's a little

00:32:18.814 --> 00:32:22.848
digression, before we go into
the second part of the canto.

00:32:22.848 --> 00:32:28.579
In Cantos I and II where Dante
is really going to face a

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:32.539
peculiar issue,
the universe I'm in.

00:32:32.539 --> 00:32:34.720
Is it a material universe?
 

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:40.098
That's the thrust of Canto II.
 

00:32:40.098 --> 00:32:44.108
Is this a natural--part of the
natural world or not?

00:32:44.108 --> 00:32:46.987
Of course, he goes on talking
about the spots on the Moon,

00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:48.348
etc., we'll come to that.
 

00:32:48.348 --> 00:32:52.465
Here in Canto I,
we shall see that he's going to

00:32:52.465 --> 00:32:55.970
discuss the arrangement of the
cosmos.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:33:00.773
You have to know,
I want you to--I want to share

00:33:00.773 --> 00:33:07.212
with you a couple of paragraphs
of a letter that Dante writes to

00:33:07.212 --> 00:33:10.279
introduce Paradise.
 

00:33:10.279 --> 00:33:12.930
This is what had happened.
 

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.920
He lives in Ravenna when he is
writing.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.641
He's probably in Ravenna by the
time he writes the earthly

00:33:18.641 --> 00:33:19.358
paradise.
 

00:33:19.358 --> 00:33:21.432
As you know,
he makes references to the

00:33:21.432 --> 00:33:23.558
Garden of Eden in terms of the
park,

00:33:23.558 --> 00:33:27.502
the pinewood,
the wood of pine trees around

00:33:27.502 --> 00:33:31.846
the city,
and we do know that he would

00:33:31.846 --> 00:33:34.720
live and die in Ravenna.
 

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:41.624
He decides to send the first
ten cantos of Paradise to the

00:33:41.624 --> 00:33:46.140
so-called Cangrande,
the great dog of Verona,

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.816
who had been his patron for a
number of years and he

00:33:49.816 --> 00:33:54.788
introduces those ten cantos that
he sends with the letter called,

00:33:54.788 --> 00:33:58.430
The Letter to Cangrande in
Italian.

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.131
It's the--Dante writes--you
know that, this is the tenth

00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:03.440
letter of a number of letters
that he writes.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:11.570
This is the--let me just read
this--it's a kind of glossing.

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:17.014
It explains the genre of the
poem explains what his models

00:34:17.014 --> 00:34:20.739
have been, and how it has to be
read.

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:27.659
Look what he says about this
circumlocution here about Paul

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:29.329
the Apostle.
 

00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:31.510
This is from Paragraph 27.
 

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.978
It's not a really long letter
but I couldn't read the whole

00:34:34.978 --> 00:34:37.429
thing without putting you all to
sleep.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.144
"The philosopher presents
an argument consonant with the

00:34:41.144 --> 00:34:43.994
above in the first book On
Heaven,"

00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:46.409
the philosopher meaning
Aristotle,

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.360
"where he says that a
heaven has material more

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.719
honorable than that of other
heavens,

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.869
beneath it to the extent that
it has this more distant than

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:56.389
they from the earth."
 

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:00.739
The nobility in the
hierarchical structure.

00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:06.440
The nobility of matter will
depend on its proximity to the

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.139
source of light and life.
 

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:14.559
"To this might be added
what the Apostle told the

00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:19.114
Ephesians concerning Christ,
who ascended above all the

00:35:19.114 --> 00:35:21.190
heavens that he might feel all
things.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.664
This is the heaven of the
Lord's pleasures to which

00:35:23.664 --> 00:35:26.347
pleasures Ezekiel refers,
in accusing Lucifer,

00:35:26.347 --> 00:35:29.722
'thou wast the seal of
resemblance full of wisdom and

00:35:29.722 --> 00:35:31.150
perfect and beauty.
 

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.179
Thou wast in the pleasure of
the Paradise of God.'

00:35:34.179 --> 00:35:36.659
After having said,
in this circumlocution,

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:38.590
that he was in the part of
Paradise,

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.893
he continues," meaning,
meaning I, himself,

00:35:41.893 --> 00:35:45.387
"by stating that he saw
things which he in this sense

00:35:45.387 --> 00:35:46.429
cannot relate.
 

00:35:46.429 --> 00:35:49.869
And he gives the cause of this
saying that the intellect goes

00:35:49.869 --> 00:35:52.965
so deeply into its desire
itself, which is God that the

00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:54.400
memory cannot follow.
 

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.610
To understand what this means
it should be noted that in this

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.164
life,
the human intellect,

00:35:59.164 --> 00:36:02.661
because of the affinity it has,
for the separated intellectual

00:36:02.661 --> 00:36:05.070
substance with which it shares
its nature,

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:07.320
reaches such a height of its
exaltation,

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:10.849
when it is exalted,
that upon its return to itself,

00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:14.219
having transcended the ordinary
capacity of men,

00:36:14.219 --> 00:36:15.320
memory fails.
 

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.896
This idea is implied to us by
the Apostle addressing the

00:36:18.896 --> 00:36:21.889
Corinthians,"
the passage I just read,

00:36:21.889 --> 00:36:24.280
"where he writes,
"I knew a man,

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:28.050
whether in the body or out of
the body I know not,

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:31.340
God knoweth,
who was caught up to the third

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:35.804
heaven and who heard secret
words who it is not granted to

00:36:35.804 --> 00:36:38.521
man--
which it is not granted to man

00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:39.260
to author.
 

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:42.784
See, when the intellect had
passed beyond the bounds of

00:36:42.784 --> 00:36:45.076
human capacity,
in its exhaltation,

00:36:45.076 --> 00:36:48.309
it could not remember what
happened outside these bounds

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:51.835
and the same idea is implied to
us in Matthew where the three

00:36:51.835 --> 00:36:55.302
disciples fell down on their
faces and told nothing about it

00:36:55.302 --> 00:36:57.829
afterwards as if they had
forgotten.

00:36:57.829 --> 00:37:02.713
And it is written in Ezekiel,
"I saw and I felt upon my

00:37:02.713 --> 00:37:03.789
face."
 

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:06.853
But if these passages don't
satisfy the skeptical,

00:37:06.853 --> 00:37:08.605
let them read Richard of St.
 

00:37:08.605 --> 00:37:11.170
Victor and his book on
contemplation,

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:14.739
or Bernard of Clairvaux,
in his book on consideration,

00:37:14.739 --> 00:37:16.983
or Augustine,
in his book on the capacity of

00:37:16.983 --> 00:37:19.141
the soul,
and they will be no longer

00:37:19.141 --> 00:37:19.789
skeptical.
 

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:23.266
Or if they should bark out
against the possibility of such

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:25.695
exaltation,
because the sinfulness of the

00:37:25.695 --> 00:37:27.773
speaker,
they should read Daniel where

00:37:27.773 --> 00:37:30.050
they would find that even
Nebuchadnezzar,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.456
by divine permission,
saw something which was a

00:37:33.456 --> 00:37:36.420
warning to sinners and then
forgot it.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:39.969
For he who make the Sun to rise
upon the good and bad,

00:37:39.969 --> 00:37:42.380
and reign it upon the just--and
the unjust--

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.380
manifests His Glory to all the
living,

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:48.409
no matter how evil they are,
sometimes mercifully,

00:37:48.409 --> 00:37:51.998
for the sake of the conversion,
sometimes harshly as a

00:37:51.998 --> 00:37:55.923
punishment and to a greater or
less degree according to his

00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:56.940
will."
 

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.826
The reason why I want to share
this passage with you is that it

00:38:02.826 --> 00:38:06.150
really places with some
clarity--

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.530
it casts, it projects a light
of--that makes things clear

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.510
about the status of the poem.
 

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.065
The poem invokes a number of
models which are all in the

00:38:19.065 --> 00:38:22.380
contemplative philosophical
tradition.

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.556
Or again, Dante is not a
student of the prophetic

00:38:26.556 --> 00:38:31.690
tradition, but he makes them
agree with the same mode of the

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:32.909
visionary.
 

00:38:32.909 --> 00:38:37.686
You see, that's what the
prophets do, they see in order

00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:38.659
to speak.
 

00:38:38.659 --> 00:38:43.922
If you are readers of the
Bible, you probably have heard

00:38:43.922 --> 00:38:48.027
and you may be right,
and if you were to believe,

00:38:48.027 --> 00:38:51.376
that there really is no
necessary link in the Bible

00:38:51.376 --> 00:38:53.643
between vision--
between the mystics,

00:38:53.643 --> 00:38:56.179
those who have visions and
those who are prophets.

00:38:56.179 --> 00:39:00.195
They are different experiences
of two different states,

00:39:00.195 --> 00:39:01.610
not so for Dante.
 

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.534
It may be true in the Bible
that they are two--Dante thinks

00:39:05.534 --> 00:39:07.699
that the two will go together.
 

00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.119
You have to have vision in
order to speak and that's really

00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:13.076
what the--
it helps us understand the

00:39:13.076 --> 00:39:19.123
sense of poetry with which Dante
invokes here at the beginning of

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.920
Paradiso.
 

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:26.577
Let me go now,
Dante has to go on--tries to

00:39:26.577 --> 00:39:34.659
find out on lines 90 or so--how,
asks the question about what

00:39:34.659 --> 00:39:38.699
has been happening to him.
 

00:39:38.699 --> 00:39:43.045
How has he been moving--he
thought he was on Earth and the

00:39:43.045 --> 00:39:46.550
earthly paradise,
now he seems to be on another

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.389
planet.
 

00:39:47.389 --> 00:39:51.585
Line 95: "If I was freed
from my perplexity,"

00:39:51.585 --> 00:39:54.849
Beatrice dismisses some fancies
of his,

00:39:54.849 --> 00:39:57.360
"thou makest thyself dull
with false fancies,

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:00.588
so that thou canst not see as
thou wouldst if thou hadst cast

00:40:00.588 --> 00:40:01.179
them off.
 

00:40:01.179 --> 00:40:04.952
You are no longer on earth as
you think, but lightening flying

00:40:04.952 --> 00:40:07.675
from its own place,
never ran so fast as thou

00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:09.469
returnest to thine."
 

00:40:09.469 --> 00:40:13.375
The journey--Dante is traveling
so fast, the speed of light,

00:40:13.375 --> 00:40:16.420
to go from the earthly paradise
to the Moon.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:19.960
"If I was freed from my
perplexity,

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.139
by the brief words she smiled
to me,

00:40:23.139 --> 00:40:26.445
I was more entangled in a new
one and I said:

00:40:26.445 --> 00:40:30.657
'I was content already,
resting from a great wonder,

00:40:30.657 --> 00:40:35.175
but now I wonder how I should
be rising above these light

00:40:35.175 --> 00:40:36.789
substances."
 

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:41.927
Two or three things,
one that I should mention to

00:40:41.927 --> 00:40:46.530
you and I will never mention
them again,

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:51.590
but Paradiso is
all--unfolds the whole--

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.518
the narrative economy with the
pilgrim experiencing

00:40:55.518 --> 00:41:01.454
perplexities and doubts,
which Beatrice will clarify and

00:41:01.454 --> 00:41:07.980
in turn those responses go on
triggering new doubts.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.688
It's really a question of
doubts and answers in an

00:41:12.688 --> 00:41:17.972
unending process of the mind
enlarging itself and always

00:41:17.972 --> 00:41:21.755
filled with wonder,
and that's really the language

00:41:21.755 --> 00:41:24.070
that I want to start emphasizing
for you here.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.760
How Dante is using this figure
of admiration,

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:31.619
he calls it,
line 97: "I was content...

00:41:31.619 --> 00:41:34.579
resting from a great wonder,
now I wonder."

00:41:34.579 --> 00:41:40.673
And this--you will see,
it continues throughout the

00:41:40.673 --> 00:41:43.599
beginning of Paradise.
 

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:45.079
What is this wonder?
 

00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:49.172
It is, first of all,
a definition of the aesthetics

00:41:49.172 --> 00:41:50.320
of Paradise.
 

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.429
Wonder translates the Latin,
admiratio,

00:41:55.429 --> 00:42:00.353
that's the Italian word,
in English, 'admiration,' which

00:42:00.353 --> 00:42:05.760
actually is to be understood,
admiratio, the Latin;

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.681
English, admiration,
but for the Middle Ages,

00:42:08.681 --> 00:42:11.139
it's nothing less than the
sublime.

00:42:11.139 --> 00:42:15.909
If you wanted to translate,
the medieval admiratio,

00:42:15.909 --> 00:42:18.980
or admiration,
into an equivalent English--

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.139
an aesthetic English term would
be the 'sublime.'

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:26.460
The Pseudo-Dyonisius idea of
the sublime, it's not a romantic

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:31.000
idea, it's probably--you are led
to believe it's an old idea.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.684
It's a Greek notion
of--indicating the mind that is

00:42:36.684 --> 00:42:43.849
overwhelmed with the spectacle
of things that dwarf the mind.

00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:47.030
Things that the mind cannot
quite comprehend,

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:48.550
that's the sublime.
 

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:52.119
They can be the sublime in
nature, they can be the sublime

00:42:52.119 --> 00:42:55.190
in art, they can be other forms
of the sublime.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.159
Dante's mode of Paradise
is indeed--

00:42:58.159 --> 00:43:01.530
this is the oscillation of a
mind that is opening up,

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.023
full of doubts,
which really now that's where

00:43:04.023 --> 00:43:06.989
he becomes subjective,
critical, and then the

00:43:06.989 --> 00:43:10.090
experience of the sublime
overwhelming him.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:16.561
This idea of the sublime now
introduces a picture of the

00:43:16.561 --> 00:43:21.739
universe the way Beatrice will
deliver it.

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:24.809
"She, therefore,
after a sigh of pity,"

00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:28.521
I love her I must say,
the way she's going to treat

00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.159
Dante like a child at this
point,

00:43:31.159 --> 00:43:36.670
"bent her eyes on me with
a look of a mother,

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:41.079
a look a mother casts on her
delirious child."

00:43:41.079 --> 00:43:43.809
Delirious in the etymological
sense.

00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:46.239
I don't think that he's really
actually crazy delirious,

00:43:46.239 --> 00:43:49.289
or the word English,
the word we use delirium seems

00:43:49.289 --> 00:43:53.273
to me--
simply means 'getting off the

00:43:53.273 --> 00:43:54.340
furrow.'
 

00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.900
Lirum,
in Latin, means the furrow.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.409
Whatever you go off rut,
as it were,

00:44:00.409 --> 00:44:03.641
of some--the furrow that you
are tracing then you are

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:07.144
delirious,
you are going off on your own,

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:10.110
in some kind of silly
direction.

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:11.130
"And she began..."
 

00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.860
That's the first picture of the
universe.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.371
We are going to find that this
picture is going to be refined

00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:19.887
in a number of ways,
but this is what he can

00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:21.000
understand now.
 

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.184
"All things,
whatsoever, have order among

00:44:25.184 --> 00:44:29.929
themselves--that's the premise
in Dante's cosmos.

00:44:29.929 --> 00:44:33.115
I will just add for you,
and she continues,

00:44:33.115 --> 00:44:37.516
"And this is the form that
makes the universe resemble

00:44:37.516 --> 00:44:38.579
God."
 

00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:43.139
This is--so that the universe
has a likeness to the divinity.

00:44:43.139 --> 00:44:48.751
Two things to be said
immediately: the word order,

00:44:48.751 --> 00:44:55.050
in case you don't know,
is ordo--means beauty.

00:44:55.050 --> 00:45:01.431
It's the idea that it's the
symmetrical arrangement of

00:45:01.431 --> 00:45:06.248
proportionate,
full of light and clarity,

00:45:06.248 --> 00:45:12.030
structure of all--of the whole:
ordo.

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:15.860
Even the word forma,
one of it means form,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.695
means that there's a shape to
things but it translates the

00:45:19.695 --> 00:45:24.900
Latin pulchritudo,
another synonym for beauty.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.199
The picture of the universe
that Dante--

00:45:27.199 --> 00:45:31.369
that Beatrice evokes for Dante
is one of beauty,

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:34.646
which in turn,
implies vision,

00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:40.860
because beauty is defined as
that which is seen gives me

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.329
pleasure.
 

00:45:42.329 --> 00:45:46.195
This is the famous definition
of Aquinas that which is seen

00:45:46.195 --> 00:45:48.329
gives pleasure,
that's beauty.

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:50.409
It's a sort of subjective idea
of beauty.

00:45:50.409 --> 00:45:53.114
Here of course,
Beatrice thinks of an objective

00:45:53.114 --> 00:45:54.349
order of the world.
 

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:57.070
It's not the fact that I like
it only,

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:02.909
though Aquinas also gives that
explanation of beauty,

00:46:02.909 --> 00:46:06.510
that which seen,
pleases, that implies a self,

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:10.119
a taste, a personal taste,
a very rich medieval

00:46:10.119 --> 00:46:13.650
understanding of the aesthetic
experience,

00:46:13.650 --> 00:46:18.355
but there is also an objective
idea of the whole universe laid

00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:22.268
out in order,
shape, clarity.

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:26.639
These are the number,
proportion, clarity;

00:46:26.639 --> 00:46:30.065
these are the attributes of
beauty and this cosmological

00:46:30.065 --> 00:46:30.501
beauty.
 

00:46:30.501 --> 00:46:33.179
Let me just continue because
this line,

00:46:33.179 --> 00:46:38.273
that the universe resembles
God, seems to be such a nice way

00:46:38.273 --> 00:46:42.898
of thinking about the universe,
but if you really think about

00:46:42.898 --> 00:46:45.170
it, it's really heretical
proposition.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:48.409
The universe is like God?
 

00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:51.590
What about the evil that there
is in the universe?

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:54.914
Is it the idea that there is a
continuity between God's

00:46:54.914 --> 00:46:58.239
transcendence and God's
imminence, what's he saying?

00:46:58.239 --> 00:47:01.565
I know that he used to be a
little bit like Marsyas and he

00:47:01.565 --> 00:47:03.998
just doesn't like--
he just likes to be a little

00:47:03.998 --> 00:47:06.829
better than Paul,
at least he's going to talk.

00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:11.802
But now this is really a
strange statement and therefore

00:47:11.802 --> 00:47:15.690
has to be clarified and I think
she will.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:20.465
I talk like this because I have
to explain that I just was

00:47:20.465 --> 00:47:24.489
looking at an old,
a great text of--in view of my

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:25.829
class today.
 

00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:29.512
Last night, I was reading a
great text by A.O. Lovejoy,

00:47:29.512 --> 00:47:32.650
some of you may know him,
he was a great--

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:35.239
one of the truly great--an
inventor,

00:47:35.239 --> 00:47:39.094
if one can speak this,
of the whole idea of the

00:47:39.094 --> 00:47:42.530
history of ideas in the United
States,

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.500
he used to be a great professor
in the 40s,

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.887
50s, and early 60s at Johns
Hopkins and he wrote a great

00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:50.487
book,
which I still advise people to

00:47:50.487 --> 00:47:51.931
read,
The Great Chain of

00:47:51.931 --> 00:47:53.880
Being, because that's really
the idea.

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:56.795
The Great Chain of
Being, it's this--what is

00:47:56.795 --> 00:47:58.429
this great chain of being?
 

00:47:58.429 --> 00:48:03.820
It's this virtual metaphor of
the continuity between the world

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.679
of unity and the world of
multiplicity and plurality.

00:48:08.679 --> 00:48:13.615
It implies that we are
only--that the universe is--this

00:48:13.615 --> 00:48:17.730
arrangement, the chain,
an invisible chain.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.690
It's the idea that reappears in
the eighteenth-century English

00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.572
literature Pope,
for instance,

00:48:23.572 --> 00:48:25.909
he uses--I read this in
Lovejoy.

00:48:25.909 --> 00:48:30.643
The--but it also implies--it's
a strange idea as it implies

00:48:30.643 --> 00:48:35.019
that the value of things,
the values of every entity

00:48:35.019 --> 00:48:39.764
depends on the position one
occupies in the various rings of

00:48:39.764 --> 00:48:40.809
the chain.
 

00:48:40.809 --> 00:48:45.117
So that if you are an angel
then you're really above human

00:48:45.117 --> 00:48:49.802
beings who are made of both--who
are beastly and angelic at the

00:48:49.802 --> 00:48:50.860
same time.
 

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.088
We have this kind of
paradoxical quality of being

00:48:54.088 --> 00:48:56.780
spiritual and animal at the same
time.

00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:00.344
Then we, according to that
idea, though some of you may

00:49:00.344 --> 00:49:04.106
doubt it, we are better than
dogs and dogs are better than

00:49:04.106 --> 00:49:05.559
stones, and so on.
 

00:49:05.559 --> 00:49:09.090
It's in a kind of hierarchy,
a system of degrees,

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:11.293
and he, Lovejoy,
goes on saying,

00:49:11.293 --> 00:49:14.780
well this is really the moment
when Dante has--

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.210
is adopting the idea of the
great chain of being,

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:23.260
and this great chain of being
makes him really unorthodox.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.530
I want to tell you that that's
not true because I think we

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.940
should read more carefully this
passage.

00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:32.233
This is the beginning here,
talking about this resemblance,

00:49:32.233 --> 00:49:34.050
how the universe resemble God.
 

00:49:34.050 --> 00:49:36.150
"Here,"
Beatrice continues,

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:40.338
"the higher creatures see
the impress of the Eternal

00:49:40.338 --> 00:49:44.675
Excellence which is the end for
which that system itself is

00:49:44.675 --> 00:49:45.349
made.
 

00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:50.983
In the order I speak of all
natures have their bent,"

00:49:50.983 --> 00:49:54.840
we all have our own specific
gravity.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.030
We're all drawn,
we all are drawn by our

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.849
desires.
 

00:49:58.849 --> 00:50:04.639
We go where our desire takes
us, our desires,

00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:07.639
and so there's a kind of
natural instinct,

00:50:07.639 --> 00:50:10.760
the natural movement in this
way in which a stone,

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.150
if you drop it,
falls always to the ground

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:16.065
naturally,
because of its specific gravity

00:50:16.065 --> 00:50:18.967
and the fire,
if you light a candle,

00:50:18.967 --> 00:50:22.599
the fire will always go up,
instinctively.

00:50:22.599 --> 00:50:25.880
All things move according to
their weight,

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.840
according to their specific
weight.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.300
It's a spiritual gravity.
 

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.920
Are we like that?
 

00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:34.329
Is that really what Dante's
saying?

00:50:34.329 --> 00:50:36.983
He seems--that's what he seems
to be saying,

00:50:36.983 --> 00:50:39.391
"according to their
different lots,

00:50:39.391 --> 00:50:42.170
nearer to the source and
farther from it;

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:45.893
they move, therefore,
to different ports over the

00:50:45.893 --> 00:50:50.813
great sea of being,
each with an instinct given to

00:50:50.813 --> 00:50:55.847
it to bear it on:
this bears fire up towards the

00:50:55.847 --> 00:50:59.670
Moon," by the way,
this is really the

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.362
passage--Dante's rewriting a
passage from Augustine's

00:51:02.362 --> 00:51:05.226
Confessions,
"this is the motive force

00:51:05.226 --> 00:51:08.768
in mortal creatures,
this binds the earth together

00:51:08.768 --> 00:51:10.039
and makes it one.
 

00:51:10.039 --> 00:51:13.641
Not only the creatures that are
without intelligence does this

00:51:13.641 --> 00:51:17.123
bow shoot, but those also who
have intellect and love,"

00:51:17.123 --> 00:51:18.010
meaning us.
 

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:19.440
We have intellect and love.
 

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:23.695
Remember the famous great poem
from--about "women who have

00:51:23.695 --> 00:51:25.550
intellect and love"?
 

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:29.005
Now we all have it,
she says, "The providence

00:51:29.005 --> 00:51:33.380
that regulates all this makes
forever quiet with its light,

00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:36.204
the heaven within which turns
that of the greatest

00:51:36.204 --> 00:51:38.507
speed," on top,
the Primo Mobile,

00:51:38.507 --> 00:51:41.789
"and thither now as to a
place appointed the power of

00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:44.668
that bowstring is bearing us
which aims at a joyous

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:45.590
mark."
 

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:49.177
"It is true,"
now, that's the correction to

00:51:49.177 --> 00:51:52.282
Lovejoy's interpretation,
"it is true that,

00:51:52.282 --> 00:51:55.271
as a shape often does not
accord with the art's intention

00:51:55.271 --> 00:51:57.940
because the material is deaf and
unresponsive,

00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:00.909
so sometimes the creature,
having the power,

00:52:00.909 --> 00:52:03.420
thus impelled,
to turn aside another way,

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.534
deviates from this course,
and, as fire may be seen to

00:52:06.534 --> 00:52:09.590
fall from a cloud,"
lightening for instance,

00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:13.309
light does not go always up,
light can go also down,

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:19.780
"and as fire may be seen
to fall from a cloud,

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.219
so the primal impulse,
diverted by false pleasure,

00:52:23.219 --> 00:52:25.719
is turned to the earth."
 

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:28.668
In other words,
within the description of the

00:52:28.668 --> 00:52:33.605
order of the cosmos,
Beatrice goes on to say that

00:52:33.605 --> 00:52:37.849
human beings are the odd
figures,

00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:44.847
that we, somehow,
have the power to deviate from

00:52:44.847 --> 00:52:48.420
this pattern of order.
 

00:52:48.420 --> 00:52:50.300
That we can undo.
 

00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:54.777
We have this paradoxical
freedom that makes us either

00:52:54.777 --> 00:52:59.773
stay within a particular idea of
what God may have meant or

00:52:59.773 --> 00:53:04.795
really for us,
or really breach that

00:53:04.795 --> 00:53:07.699
particular order.
 

00:53:07.699 --> 00:53:13.119
Human beings are the absurd
elements in this ordered

00:53:13.119 --> 00:53:15.989
portrait of the universe.
 

00:53:15.989 --> 00:53:18.980
That is the whole statement of
freedom;

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.054
so that Dante is removing from
a deterministic,

00:53:22.054 --> 00:53:25.195
that's what would make it into
a heretical text,

00:53:25.195 --> 00:53:28.469
a deterministic idea of what
the cosmos then.

00:53:28.469 --> 00:53:31.539
"Then she turned her face
again to the sky."

00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:37.931
Let me go--I'll go a little bit
quickly on Canto II and so--but

00:53:37.931 --> 00:53:40.820
I will need a few minutes.
 

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.809
Canto II, Dante now is on this
fear of the Moon,

00:53:43.809 --> 00:53:46.797
if you know that,
and there will be a discussion

00:53:46.797 --> 00:53:47.880
on the spots.
 

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.518
There's this whole medieval
legend: if you look at the Moon,

00:53:52.518 --> 00:53:57.271
a full Moon you see the dark
spots and the legend was that

00:53:57.271 --> 00:54:01.284
Cain--
the medieval legend--that Cain

00:54:01.284 --> 00:54:08.199
riding away from the knowledge
of the murder of his brother had

00:54:08.199 --> 00:54:10.952
actually,
with the help of God,

00:54:10.952 --> 00:54:14.300
God had removed him from the
earth and had taken refuge

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:16.978
there,
and whatever we see there is

00:54:16.978 --> 00:54:18.889
just the imprint of Cain.
 

00:54:18.889 --> 00:54:22.599
Dante dismisses this legend and
goes on talking about science.

00:54:22.599 --> 00:54:25.570
She, Beatrice,
will have a scientific

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:30.358
discourse, and the question is:
is this a natural cosmos or

00:54:30.358 --> 00:54:31.018
not?
 

00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:38.097
Do we see shades on the Moon
simply because there's a density

00:54:38.097 --> 00:54:41.400
or not a rarity of matter?
 

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.668
Or is it because,
therefore, light has a way of

00:54:44.668 --> 00:54:47.510
going through this matter of the
Moon?

00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:49.719
According to the principle,
more or less,

00:54:49.719 --> 00:54:51.099
the rarity and density?
 

00:54:51.099 --> 00:54:54.222
Or is it because there's a
different way in which light is

00:54:54.222 --> 00:54:54.989
distributed?
 

00:54:54.989 --> 00:54:57.838
The solution Dante gives,
or Beatrice will give,

00:54:57.838 --> 00:54:59.050
is the second one.
 

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:02.237
We see the shadows on the Moon
simply because there is a

00:55:02.237 --> 00:55:03.860
different source of light.
 

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:07.570
In other words,
the natural cosmos has to be

00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:11.110
understood in terms of its
metaphysics.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.358
The physics has only--that can
only be understood in terms of

00:55:14.358 --> 00:55:17.291
metaphysics,
but what I want to stress to

00:55:17.291 --> 00:55:21.987
you is that the natural and the
supernatural are always seen by

00:55:21.987 --> 00:55:24.639
Dante as holding hands together.
 

00:55:24.639 --> 00:55:27.268
They are not two separate
worlds.

00:55:27.268 --> 00:55:31.199
They are not two separate
dimensions.

00:55:31.199 --> 00:55:35.849
They are two different ways of
looking at the same thing.

00:55:35.849 --> 00:55:39.193
Now let's see how he introduces
the canto, which I think is

00:55:39.193 --> 00:55:41.268
important for a number of
reasons.

00:55:41.268 --> 00:55:46.739
Canto II: "O you who in a
little bark,"

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:52.780
the language of humility is
suspect at this point,

00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:57.250
because we know that the
sublime is the mode,

00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.172
is the trope that he will use,
"O you who in a little

00:56:00.172 --> 00:56:02.119
bark, you,"
he's addressing us;

00:56:02.119 --> 00:56:06.559
he's beginning to address
readers, "eager to listen,

00:56:06.559 --> 00:56:12.570
have followed behind my ship,
that singing makes her way,

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.518
turn back to see your shores
again;

00:56:16.518 --> 00:56:20.429
do not put forth on the deep,
for, perhaps losing me,

00:56:20.429 --> 00:56:22.760
you would be left bewildered.
 

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.789
The waters I take were never
sailed before."

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:30.929
That's--it gives poignancy to
the little bark.

00:56:30.929 --> 00:56:32.990
It's a little bark that is
doing something,

00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:36.001
so mighty;
I'm doing such a magnificent,

00:56:36.001 --> 00:56:38.090
extraordinary adventure.
 

00:56:38.090 --> 00:56:41.309
"The waters I take were
never sailed before.

00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:43.380
Minerva breathes,
Apollo pilots me,

00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:46.119
and the nine Muses show me the
Bears."

00:56:46.119 --> 00:56:50.608
And then, a restriction of the
agents that he has been

00:56:50.608 --> 00:56:55.434
addressing: "You other
few," a kind of reductive

00:56:55.434 --> 00:56:58.809
apostrophe,
the very few here.

00:56:58.809 --> 00:57:01.400
It's the crème de la
crème,

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.150
he would say of you guys.
 

00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:07.978
A very few who really know and
are interested in the mysteries

00:57:07.978 --> 00:57:12.096
in the most esoteric,
arcane sciences that he's going

00:57:12.096 --> 00:57:13.679
to put out here.
 

00:57:13.679 --> 00:57:17.773
"You are the few that
reached out early,"

00:57:17.773 --> 00:57:22.440
the language actually says,
"turn your neck."

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.760
This is really a poor
translation.

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:29.860
I don't know what other
translators say.

00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:33.706
"You are the few who turn
your neck,"

00:57:33.706 --> 00:57:38.639
because it's the whole idea,
another form of presumption.

00:57:38.639 --> 00:57:41.199
You may have heard,
you may recall,

00:57:41.199 --> 00:57:43.909
in the Bible about the stiff
neck.

00:57:43.909 --> 00:57:49.208
Of course, the neck is always
the emblem of conversion when

00:57:49.208 --> 00:57:52.204
you want to--
for Plato, you reach a

00:57:52.204 --> 00:57:55.010
conversion you really turn the
neck,

00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:56.260
that's all you do.
 

00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.056
Not for Dante,
Dante you can turn upside down,

00:57:59.056 --> 00:58:01.728
but in Plato,
you turn the neck and you know

00:58:01.728 --> 00:58:03.780
where the source of light is.
 

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:08.657
The biblical counter to that is
there may be the stiff neck,

00:58:08.657 --> 00:58:11.800
those who do not--who lack
humility.

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:15.489
Behind this metaphor,
there is the whole idea that

00:58:15.489 --> 00:58:20.143
what makes a human being--
that what confers dignity to a

00:58:20.143 --> 00:58:23.168
human being,
is the power that we,

00:58:23.168 --> 00:58:27.492
among all animals have,
to look up at the sky and see

00:58:27.492 --> 00:58:30.730
and look at the stars and
therefore wonder.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:33.389
All other animals are always
looking down.

00:58:33.389 --> 00:58:35.289
We are alone.
 

00:58:35.289 --> 00:58:38.554
Of course, there are other
people who believe that what

00:58:38.554 --> 00:58:42.001
makes human beings--particular
dignity to human beings--is

00:58:42.001 --> 00:58:43.150
something else.
 

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:45.085
Of all of them,
as those who said,

00:58:45.085 --> 00:58:47.610
that we speak of course,
but of all of them,

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:51.190
the one I really like is that
we are capable of laughing.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:54.195
That's the explanation:
it's an Aristotelian idea,

00:58:54.195 --> 00:58:56.219
but it's explanation of comedy.
 

00:58:56.219 --> 00:59:00.954
Here, that's the allusion
though, you are--the few who

00:59:00.954 --> 00:59:05.778
could be also implying,
like me, do not be too arrogant

00:59:05.778 --> 00:59:07.119
about this.
 

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:07.643
"..
 

00:59:07.643 --> 00:59:10.652
.who reached out early for
angels' bread,"

00:59:10.652 --> 00:59:12.206
knowledge,
for knowledge,

00:59:12.206 --> 00:59:14.523
"by which man here lived
but never come from it

00:59:14.523 --> 00:59:17.148
satisfied,
you may indeed put forth your

00:59:17.148 --> 00:59:21.155
vessel on the salt depths,
holding my furrow before the

00:59:21.155 --> 00:59:23.239
water returns smooth again.
 

00:59:23.239 --> 00:59:27.201
Those glorious ones who cross
the sea to Colchis were not

00:59:27.201 --> 00:59:29.960
amazed,"
once again the language of

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.789
admiration, the language is
sublime;

00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:37.282
I'll come to this in a moment,
"as you shall be when they

00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:39.860
saw Jason turned
ploughman."

00:59:39.860 --> 00:59:43.710
Well, the metaphor of the
journey by water,

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:47.639
to describe now an aerial
journey, so an anti--

00:59:47.639 --> 00:59:52.005
Dante is clearly thinking of
that metaphoric compression that

00:59:52.005 --> 00:59:53.460
we saw in Ulysses.
 

00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:56.454
You remember the sailing that
became a mad flight,

00:59:56.454 --> 00:59:59.510
now here it's the flight that
becomes a sailing.

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:03.929
The notion that he is guiding
us, so the sense of his

01:00:03.929 --> 01:00:08.349
responsibility is turning us
back, unlike Ulysses;

01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:12.809
we dispose of that mythic
resonance very quickly.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:16.980
What he's really saying is that
the journey we're undertaking,

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:21.081
which is the reading of this
book, can become extraordinarily

01:00:21.081 --> 01:00:22.039
dangerous.
 

01:00:22.039 --> 01:00:27.853
The reason it's dangerous is
because he is traveling over

01:00:27.853 --> 01:00:31.800
water that leaves no wake behind
it.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:39.960
This is the--what I would call
the danger of the seafaring.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.224
In seafaring,
you have no pre-established

01:00:43.224 --> 01:00:43.960
routes.
 

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.282
There is no way,
no road, no path that can be

01:00:47.282 --> 01:00:51.945
there fixed and you can find,
so he's inviting us to keep

01:00:51.945 --> 01:00:55.507
very close to him,
but we might be losing him at

01:00:55.507 --> 01:00:56.489
the same time.
 

01:00:56.489 --> 01:01:01.532
The journey by water is not
exactly like the journey by

01:01:01.532 --> 01:01:06.389
land, because there are no
pre-established directions

01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:08.070
marked for us.
 

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.300
Then finally,
this allusion to Jason;

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:16.666
so he's not like--Ulysses is
like the hero of the Argonauts,

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:20.760
who has gone looking for the
golden fleece.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.730
And it's an image that he
appears at the end of

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:27.829
Paradiso XXXIII,
where Dante has the god Neptune

01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:32.748
from the depth wondering at the
extraordinary power of the human

01:01:32.748 --> 01:01:35.170
imagination, the human will.
 

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:38.239
They wonder at the heroics of
Jason.

01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:44.409
Neptune is without--he can't
quite believe what he sees.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:48.632
It's clearly an allusion for
what Dante himself is going to

01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:52.710
do, in seeing God face to face,
and then returning to the

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:53.440
earth.
 

01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:57.673
What I want to emphasize,
and here really I will stop and

01:01:57.673 --> 01:02:02.059
give you a chance to ask me some
questions, the--is that we

01:02:02.059 --> 01:02:07.623
probably never read--
I think we skipped Canto XVIII

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:09.949
of Inferno.
 

01:02:09.949 --> 01:02:12.539
I think we did,
I don't think that I asked you

01:02:12.539 --> 01:02:16.108
to read it, and I don't presume
that you would go and read what

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:17.719
I don't ask you to read.
 

01:02:17.719 --> 01:02:21.010
You never really did,
but in Canto XVIII,

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:24.730
Dante--if you go and read Canto
XVIII of Inferno,

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:28.976
you will find Jason punished
among the flatters and the

01:02:28.976 --> 01:02:32.128
seducers,
because he is famous for

01:02:32.128 --> 01:02:35.809
seducing Hypsiphyle and
abandoning her.

01:02:35.809 --> 01:02:39.070
It's a version of what happened
to Theseus and Medea,

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.969
it's one of the great fixations
of Greek--

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:46.014
one of the great situations
of--repeated situations of a

01:02:46.014 --> 01:02:46.900
Greek tragedy.
 

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.514
An interesting thing is that
Dante now is distinguishing

01:02:50.514 --> 01:02:53.210
between the ethical judgment of
Jason,

01:02:53.210 --> 01:02:55.849
who is behind in Inferno
XVIII,

01:02:55.849 --> 01:03:01.550
and the imaginative aesthetic
value of the adventure itself.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:06.204
Now, is he saying therefore,
that the good and the beautiful

01:03:06.204 --> 01:03:08.809
are really two distinct things?
 

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:13.329
He's warning us about that and
that's where I want to pick up

01:03:13.329 --> 01:03:18.077
the conversation next time when
we are going to be talking about

01:03:18.077 --> 01:03:21.768
the value of images and the
ethics of images.

01:03:21.768 --> 01:03:25.739
Let me finish here now and see
if there are some questions

01:03:25.739 --> 01:03:27.760
which I will try to answer.
 

01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:45.659
Please.
 

01:03:45.659 --> 01:03:48.663
Student:
Dante has--turning their minds

01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:52.802
to a bread of angels and then he
talks about the image of water

01:03:52.802 --> 01:03:55.405
and all images and symbols that
come in.

01:03:55.405 --> 01:03:58.409
It seems a little shaky to me
in talking about

01:03:58.409 --> 01:04:01.947
&gt;,
is that you're turning your

01:04:01.947 --> 01:04:04.684
mind to bread,
it's very strange thinking.

01:04:04.684 --> 01:04:08.556
I was just wondering if you
could talk about that symbolism

01:04:08.556 --> 01:04:12.161
or significance of that,
of turning your mind to bread.

01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:15.965
Prof: The question is
about explaining the image of

01:04:15.965 --> 01:04:20.840
bread in the beginning of Canto
II of Paradise,

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.400
where Dante says,
addressing the readers,

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:32.199
that they are turning their
neck too early to the bread of

01:04:32.199 --> 01:04:33.989
angels."
 

01:04:33.989 --> 01:04:38.213
I have a question for you;
in what way do you find it

01:04:38.213 --> 01:04:38.699
strange?
 

01:04:38.699 --> 01:04:40.500
Student:
I just mean--well I have "eyes"

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.692
instead of "turning your neck,
but just talking about the

01:04:42.692 --> 01:04:43.748
intellect with the bread...
 

01:04:43.748 --> 01:04:45.079
Prof: Okay,
all right.

01:04:45.079 --> 01:04:48.516
The--well the bread of angels,
so I would see the bread of

01:04:48.516 --> 01:04:51.713
angels,
and the bread of angels is

01:04:51.713 --> 01:04:55.570
knowledge,
so I think that the

01:04:55.570 --> 01:05:01.172
implied--the transference,
the metaphorical reading by

01:05:01.172 --> 01:05:02.670
Mandelbaum is accurate.
 

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:08.980
I wish it were more literal,
but just as I think that--

01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:12.340
my own translation of
course--Sinclair also,

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:16.893
it's one of the few times that
he deviates from the literal

01:05:16.893 --> 01:05:19.614
burden,
because the literal burden of

01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:23.351
the metaphor has a number of
resonances which I think are

01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:26.311
valuable,
like exactly the stiff neck,

01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:28.179
the turning of the neck.
 

01:05:28.179 --> 01:05:32.900
In the context like
Paradise,

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.869
where Dante starts out by
clearly locating himself within

01:05:37.869 --> 01:05:40.710
some contradictory
possibilities:

01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:45.327
the possibility of a
transgression or the possibility

01:05:45.327 --> 01:05:50.289
of trespassing,
in the case of Paul.

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:53.360
So where exactly is he?
 

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:59.311
That image is his--by the image
of the turning of the neck early

01:05:59.311 --> 01:06:02.619
for the bread of angels is
also--

01:06:02.619 --> 01:06:07.413
reverberates with anxieties
that he has about his own

01:06:07.413 --> 01:06:10.639
adventure and his own
enterprise.

01:06:10.639 --> 01:06:15.219
That's--I don't know if this
answers your perplexity but--

01:06:15.219 --> 01:06:16.199
Student:
So the bread of angels is

01:06:16.199 --> 01:06:16.960
really knowledge and then...
 

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.231
Prof: Knowledge,
the bread of angels is

01:06:20.231 --> 01:06:20.960
knowledge.
 

01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:24.523
Yeah, that which--the
idea--it's the idea that you

01:06:24.523 --> 01:06:28.668
find in the Banquet,
that why do philosophers--well

01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:32.596
I'm sure that it's literally
true that there is nothing

01:06:32.596 --> 01:06:36.960
better for a great philosophical
conversation than a glass of

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:41.396
wine, and you sit around and you
talk, but it clearly is--it's

01:06:41.396 --> 01:06:44.523
the food of the mind,
the food of knowledge,

01:06:44.523 --> 01:06:48.088
the taste of knowledge,
etc., all those metaphors.

01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:50.996
Student:
Also can you just kind of

01:06:50.996 --> 01:06:54.268
&gt;?
 

01:06:54.268 --> 01:06:55.358
Prof: Yes.
 

01:06:55.358 --> 01:06:57.981
Since--that's very good,
that's very good,

01:06:57.981 --> 01:07:00.478
because I think--can that be
also grace?

01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:03.550
Yes, that's very good,
because we are here in the

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.943
world of Paradise and I know
that I'm giving a sort of

01:07:06.943 --> 01:07:10.143
philosophical emphasis,
but there is also the--with

01:07:10.143 --> 01:07:13.664
Paul, there is also the
theological--we are dealing with

01:07:13.664 --> 01:07:17.121
the poetic, more than the
philosophical--the poetic and

01:07:17.121 --> 01:07:18.657
the theological to that.
 

01:07:18.657 --> 01:07:20.706
Absolutely, very good,
thank you.

01:07:20.706 --> 01:07:21.730
Other questions?
 

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:22.177
Please.
 

01:07:22.177 --> 01:07:24.865
Student:
In the beginning of Canto I

01:07:24.865 --> 01:07:28.514
when he describes how God sheds
more or less più

01:07:28.514 --> 01:07:32.420
e meno light on different
parts,

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.336
the phrase più
e meno is also used in

01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:38.079
Purgatory to describe
different aesthetic

01:07:38.079 --> 01:07:41.342
perspectives,
is Dante trying to bring that

01:07:41.342 --> 01:07:45.842
in here or is he just talking
about the hierarchy of who God

01:07:45.842 --> 01:07:47.980
chooses to shed light on?
 

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:52.717
Prof: Well good--
the question is in line 3 of

01:07:52.717 --> 01:07:56.068
Paradiso I,
Dante uses a phrase,

01:07:56.068 --> 01:07:59.739
"more and less,"
talk about the light that

01:07:59.739 --> 01:08:04.420
shines on creation according to
the principle of more or less.

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:09.677
Then the concern is that Dante
uses this phrase quite often in

01:08:09.677 --> 01:08:14.574
Canto X of Purgatory,
where, in the context of art,

01:08:14.574 --> 01:08:18.510
there is that phrase about--
I call it, approximation.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:24.359
Is Dante joining the two?
 

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:28.079
Does he want us to put the two
things together?

01:08:28.079 --> 01:08:30.760
Let me answer that.
 

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.998
Far be it for me ever to say,
no Dante, does not want us to

01:08:34.998 --> 01:08:35.729
do that.
 

01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:40.087
The whole reading,
if there is a principle to the

01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:43.675
way I read,
is that the more echoes you can

01:08:43.675 --> 01:08:46.945
find the better,
I think, that we serve--the

01:08:46.945 --> 01:08:50.300
better we understand the poem
and we reserve--

01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.899
I take it to be the intention
of the poet.

01:08:52.899 --> 01:08:56.952
I had never really conjoined
the two in my own mind for one

01:08:56.952 --> 01:08:59.327
simple reason,
because here I think

01:08:59.327 --> 01:09:03.170
it's--Dante's asserting the
principle of hierarchy.

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.117
I think that in
Purgatorio Dante is doing

01:09:06.117 --> 01:09:09.630
something completely different
since the context there is

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:13.127
pride,
he's really reversing all forms

01:09:13.127 --> 01:09:16.095
of--
what is the measure of the

01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:17.449
human beings?
 

01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:19.170
How do we measure human beings?
 

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:22.291
I could say that this is
actually a problem that was

01:09:22.291 --> 01:09:22.720
here.
 

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.244
Every time you have a hierarchy
I'm really placing myself in

01:09:27.244 --> 01:09:31.787
between an order,
a rank of different values,

01:09:31.787 --> 01:09:38.140
and so I can say that that is
also happening in Canto I.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:43.422
Frankly, the context will not
allow me to go too much beyond

01:09:43.422 --> 01:09:44.050
this.
 

01:09:44.050 --> 01:09:47.921
Yeah, there is a way in which
every time I talk of hierarchy

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:50.350
I'm talking about a rank
ordering,

01:09:50.350 --> 01:09:53.881
and therefore,
the sense of my place it's a

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:57.920
little bit removed from the
concerns here of--

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:04.600
it's there but not the most
compelling argument for me.

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:09.338
You may prove me wrong,
of course, then I would say

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.329
this issue appears.
 

01:10:11.329 --> 01:10:16.277
We join things together;
let's try to keep also each

01:10:16.277 --> 01:10:20.536
entity in its own specificity,
so that we really understand

01:10:20.536 --> 01:10:23.557
that the--
how far his thinking can go

01:10:23.557 --> 01:10:27.750
with the representation of a
scene-- then another.

01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:30.020
I like that, good.
 

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.779
I like the fact that you
joined, you combined.

01:10:32.779 --> 01:10:34.380
Yes?
 

01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.210
Student:  I had a
question, who is this audience?

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:43.967
Homer, Virgil and later
Shakespeare, we know that they

01:10:43.967 --> 01:10:48.456
are writing or speaking with a
wide range of people

01:10:48.456 --> 01:10:51.149
&gt;.
 

01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:55.130
But now when we read him in
Paradise,

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:59.507
I'm so aware of how much one
would need to know about

01:10:59.507 --> 01:11:04.221
philosophy and theology and
poetics before you appreciate

01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:05.569
what he did.
 

01:11:05.569 --> 01:11:12.760
Prof: That's--the
question is who on earth could

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.689
Dante's audience be?
 

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:22.063
We know who the audience of
Homer, Virgil can be--or is,

01:11:22.063 --> 01:11:28.436
but what about the audience,
whether someone has to know

01:11:28.436 --> 01:11:32.609
philosophy, theology,
and so on.

01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:37.465
My answer is you're right,
that we do know roughly about

01:11:37.465 --> 01:11:39.963
Homer,
because after all,

01:11:39.963 --> 01:11:45.551
there are--there is always the
Modicus in the Odyssey

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:51.234
who is singing to the audience
at court until Ulysses appears

01:11:51.234 --> 01:11:56.350
and rhapsodes and Homer is one
of the rhapsodes,

01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:59.140
or maybe the one who stitches
together the voices of the

01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.750
rhapsodes.
 

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:03.850
That gives us a miniature
account of an audience.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:10.470
With Dante it's a little bit
more difficult to understand.

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:14.318
It's, I think,
I can tell you now contemporary

01:12:14.318 --> 01:12:18.813
poets think that Dante's poem,
especially Inferno,

01:12:18.813 --> 01:12:22.546
ought to be read in the streets
like raps odes going on the

01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:25.923
ancient Greece,
they would go from one fair,

01:12:25.923 --> 01:12:28.856
one marketplace,
and the day of the market to

01:12:28.856 --> 01:12:30.826
another,
and gather people together,

01:12:30.826 --> 01:12:32.609
the feast days of the
community,

01:12:32.609 --> 01:12:36.710
but I can be a little bit more
romantic.

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:41.764
I think it's true,
but that Dante probably did

01:12:41.764 --> 01:12:48.279
read some of his cantos when he
was in Ravenna or Verona to

01:12:48.279 --> 01:12:51.149
the--
in the evening gathering,

01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:55.601
the circles of courtiers,
but I don't think of Dante as a

01:12:55.601 --> 01:12:56.390
courtier.
 

01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:59.470
He doesn't seem to have the
values.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:03.047
He has aristocratic values of
the mind of course,

01:13:03.047 --> 01:13:07.073
but he doesn't seem to share
the social problems of the

01:13:07.073 --> 01:13:07.819
court.
 

01:13:07.819 --> 01:13:13.378
I can think of some aspects of
Shakespeare being the poet of

01:13:13.378 --> 01:13:14.510
the court.
 

01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:19.847
The poet who would be read by
the queen and he wants--he wants

01:13:19.847 --> 01:13:23.524
the queen to read his text,
or the theatre,

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.149
we know about the theatre.
 

01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:29.876
A part of Paradiso was
not known at all to some

01:13:29.876 --> 01:13:32.740
people--
the first ten cantos were sent

01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:36.849
to the patron who probably gave
what today we would call a

01:13:36.849 --> 01:13:39.310
grant,
you apply for a grant.

01:13:39.310 --> 01:13:42.813
He would give him a gift for
the great, extraordinary

01:13:42.813 --> 01:13:46.519
dedication, and that's what
patrons would--the role they

01:13:46.519 --> 01:13:47.529
would play.
 

01:13:47.529 --> 01:13:55.020
I think that Dante--and this is
going to be very romantic--

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.265
à la Benjamin now--I
think that Dante writes this

01:13:58.265 --> 01:14:00.390
kind of poetry at the end for
God.

01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:02.130
I don't think that he could
care.

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:08.109
I don't think he has an
empirical audience in mind.

01:14:08.109 --> 01:14:10.069
He really means the few.
 

01:14:10.069 --> 01:14:13.244
I don't think it's a rhetorical
strategy at the end:

01:14:13.244 --> 01:14:15.550
you few who are going to read
that.

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:21.904
And it's too much written--it's
written too much in the mode of

01:14:21.904 --> 01:14:23.750
a quest for God.
 

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:28.029
A prayer, actually it's a
moment at one point where

01:14:28.029 --> 01:14:31.109
language bends into a prayer
and--

01:14:31.109 --> 01:14:35.060
with a language of a longing
that goes with prayer,

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:37.210
that I really think it's meant
for God.

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:41.047
I mean it in a very serious
way, and it ends with a prayer:

01:14:41.047 --> 01:14:44.489
the great Canto XXXIII is an
extraordinary prayer.

01:14:44.489 --> 01:14:46.550
That's my answer.
 

01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:51.682
I'm sure that the--I have a
dear friend who wants to make a

01:14:51.682 --> 01:14:55.488
movie about reading Dante in the
streets.

01:14:55.488 --> 01:14:59.903
That's fine,
but I'm not sure that that's

01:14:59.903 --> 01:15:02.220
what Dante thought.
 

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.970
I mean I'm really not sure
about that.

01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:07.515
Great question,
thank you, we'll see you next

01:15:07.515 --> 01:15:08.079
time.

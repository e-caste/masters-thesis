00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.911
Prof: We're now going to
start the block of the course

00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:08.828
which is on ecology,
and these are the titles of the

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:10.470
upcoming lectures.
 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.540
You can think of ecology as
providing the theater in which

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.065
the evolutionary play occurs;
that's a metaphor from Evelyn

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:16.420
Hutchinson.
 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.800
And basically I'm doing a
top-down, and then going back;

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.645
going from the top down,
and then going from the bottom

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:32.805
back up to the top,
in going through these

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:33.490
lectures.
 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.326
So I'm going to start today by
taking about climate and the

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:40.890
planet,
and how life is distributed on

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.483
the planet,
and then move from that into

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:44.340
the biology.
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.673
So looking at physiological
ecology and interactions with

00:00:47.673 --> 00:00:50.867
the physical environment,
leading from that through

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:52.946
population growth,
competition,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:57.864
predation, parasitism,
up to community--so that's sort

00:00:57.864 --> 00:01:03.445
of a way of doing a Cartesian
bottom up construction of

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:07.585
communities--
and then dealing with some of

00:01:07.585 --> 00:01:10.760
the larger scale issues in
ecology,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.250
which have to do with islands
and meta-populations,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.970
and then systems ecology,
energy and matter flow.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.748
And then I'm going to end with
a lecture which is both about

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:30.230
the role of biodiversity in
ecology,

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.599
but also about general takes on
the value of biodiversity,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:38.334
and this last lecture in
ecology is going to include some

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:41.470
stuff like an economic take on
biodiversity,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.319
an evolutionary take on
biodiversity,

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:48.123
as well as the issue of does
biodiversity actually help

00:01:48.123 --> 00:01:50.970
ecosystems to function better?
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.370
So that's what's coming up.
 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.587
And today we're going to
basically look at the climates

00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:58.565
of the planet,
how the planet can be looked at

00:01:58.565 --> 00:02:02.540
as a set of climate machines,
and how they generate the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.390
biomes, on the planet.
 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.888
So at this scale,
this stuff I think is probably

00:02:07.888 --> 00:02:09.229
pretty familiar.
 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.823
The world climate is of course
cold at the poles and warm at

00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:15.930
the tropics, but there's a lot
of detail in that.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.021
It tends to be warmer and
wetter on the western sides of

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.566
the northern continents,
and cooler and drier on the

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:25.720
eastern sides of the northern
continents.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.055
The influence of the Gulf
Stream can be seen pretty

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:31.514
clearly here in Europe,
with this large warm area being

00:02:31.514 --> 00:02:35.500
sort of pushed up and to the
right by the warm water,

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.008
which is coming up out of the
Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:38.008 --> 00:02:41.978
And if you go far east into the
huge block of the Eurasian land

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:45.032
mass,
you can get so far away from

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:50.120
the effects of the ocean that
the coldest temperature,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.340
at least in the Northern
Hemisphere,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.280
was recorded right about here.
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.860
It was, I think,
-127 Fahrenheit;

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.060
which, you know, that's nippy.
 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:07.325
There are interesting
similarities in the climates of

00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.938
similar places.
 

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:12.911
So if you look at the western
leading edge of North and South

00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.343
America,
and you go about as far south

00:03:16.343 --> 00:03:20.336
of the equator as north,
basically what you run into is

00:03:20.336 --> 00:03:21.590
a temperate rainforest.
 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.925
There's a temperate rainforest
that is stretching from Northern

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:28.027
California up to Alaska,
and there's another temperate

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:31.038
rainforest which stretches along
the coast of Chile.

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:35.720
And these similarities in
climate have created similar

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.430
biomes and similar selection
pressures,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.520
and have led to convergences in
the communities that you see in

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.508
these places.
 

00:03:44.508 --> 00:03:47.729
So if you really want to
understand why is it that if I

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:51.745
am standing say in Chile,
or in part of New Zealand,

00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:56.050
or in British Columbia,
that they kind of remind me of

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.870
each other?
 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.473
Even though the plants may not
be at all related,

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.251
they look the same,
it feels the same,

00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:06.180
the forests have similar
structure.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.913
Well you have to go back to why
the planet as a whole constructs

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:15.098
similar climates in those
places.

00:04:15.098 --> 00:04:18.415
Part of it, at a local level,
if you're looking say at what's

00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:21.620
generating the rainforest in
Chile or what's generating the

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.360
rainforest in British Columbia,
has to do with the way that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.149
mountains are interacting with
atmosphere.

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:32.161
So in both, in these
situations, you have got clouds

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:36.961
that are coming in off of the
ocean, and they are being forced

00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:39.399
upward by a mountain range.
 

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:43.853
And there's some very simple
physical chemistry that goes on

00:04:43.853 --> 00:04:46.269
when you force a cloud upward.
 

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:49.750
The rising air is going to be
cooling before it condenses.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.750
Then it will condense and form
heavy clouds,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.016
and they will rain out,
and as the wind is going to

00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:59.350
push them up over the top of the
mountain range,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.088
basically all the water will
leave the cloud.

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.800
Well that's what's creating
that rainforest.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.276
Okay?
 

00:05:05.276 --> 00:05:10.807
And the reason for that is that
cold air can't hold as much

00:05:10.807 --> 00:05:12.810
water as warm air.
 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.617
And the cooling is going on at
a rate of about 6 degrees

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:21.990
Centigrade per kilometer of
elevation, going up.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.209
The air which was at 20,
coming in off the ocean--

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.214
this is 20 degrees
Centigrade--is hitting perhaps 4

00:05:28.214 --> 00:05:30.500
degrees at the top of the
mountain--

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.779
so you could think of this as
the Sierras,

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:38.879
or the top of say the Cascades
in Oregon or Washington--

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.440
and then it falls down the
other side.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.300
And over here you have dry air
falling.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.146
This is wet air rising,
and it rains out,

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:48.709
and then you have dry air
falling.

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:51.040
And this wet air rising and
raining,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.300
and dry air falling and
warming, and ending up 4 degrees

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.857
warmer at the same elevation on
this side than it was on this

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.971
side,
because of the heat of

00:05:59.971 --> 00:06:03.569
condensation that's been
released by the rain here.

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:04.810
This is something I want you to
remember,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.321
because it actually also
applies at the scale of the

00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:10.637
whole planet,
when you have very large air

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:14.160
cells that are rotating on the
planet.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.605
And where there's dry air
falling, you're going to get

00:06:17.605 --> 00:06:19.839
deserts,
and where there is warm air

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.149
rising you're going to get
rainforests,

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.970
whether you have the mountain
range there or not.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.233
So we'll see that in a minute,
and that's why I wanted to

00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:32.089
introduce this level of analysis
at this point.

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:32.355
Okay?
 

00:06:32.355 --> 00:06:35.538
So this warm air falling here
is called foehn in Switzerland,

00:06:35.538 --> 00:06:38.829
and the Swiss always complain
that it gives them headaches;

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:41.769
it's called the Santa Ana wind
in Los Angeles;

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:45.305
and there's a special wind that
blows down the valley behind

00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.942
Lahaina, Maui,
that can hit 140 miles an hour

00:06:47.942 --> 00:06:49.860
sometimes, which is similar.
 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.956
So these local dry hot winds
can be very important,

00:06:53.956 --> 00:06:58.788
and they're actually what drive
the wild fires in Malibu and

00:06:58.788 --> 00:07:00.509
things like that.
 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:04.439
Okay, now let's take a look at
the whole planet.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:08.430
If the earth was simply a
stationary ball,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.607
sitting in space,
undisturbed,

00:07:11.607 --> 00:07:15.879
but was being heated at the
equator,

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:18.620
it would develop basically two
convection cells,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.149
one in each hemisphere.
 

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:24.528
So there would be cold air that
was falling on the poles.

00:07:24.528 --> 00:07:27.502
It would be falling down to the
surface and it would be picking

00:07:27.502 --> 00:07:30.002
up moisture and rising,
and basically you would get a

00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:31.730
belt of rainforest around the
equator,

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.293
and you would have deserts at
the poles and a gradient in

00:07:35.293 --> 00:07:35.930
between.
 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.379
That would be what would happen
if the earth were not rotating.

00:07:40.379 --> 00:07:44.370
The earth is rotating,
and because it's rotating,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:49.410
on an idealized planet you
would get three Hadley cells,

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.350
going out from the
equator--three in the north and

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.954
three in the south--
and at the equator you would

00:07:55.954 --> 00:08:00.278
have warm air rising and it
would be dropping rain,

00:08:00.278 --> 00:08:03.341
because as it rose it cooled,
and it would lose capacity to

00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:05.189
hold water and it would rain
out.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:10.728
Then it would flow northward
and fall at about 30º

00:08:10.728 --> 00:08:11.550
north.
 

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.300
Okay?
 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.360
There it would be interacting
with another similar cell that

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:23.850
would be carrying warm air north
and rising at about 60 north.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:24.208
Okay?
 

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:28.360
Remember where the rainforests
were in Chile and in British

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.442
Columbia;
they are in this region here

00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:35.320
and in this region here.
 

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.950
And this is where the deserts
are, around the world;

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.490
they're at about 30 North and
30 South.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.279
Now this is an idealized format.
 

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:49.350
At the boundary,
by the way, of where you've got

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:53.940
the polar highs and the northern
Hadley cell here,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.830
right at this boundary is where
you get a polar front,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:00.811
and this is where the jet
stream goes around the world in

00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:04.649
the north and it goes around the
world in the south.

00:09:04.649 --> 00:09:07.828
So the location of the jet
stream that drives most of the

00:09:07.828 --> 00:09:11.974
weather that we encounter here,
and the idea that it might say

00:09:11.974 --> 00:09:16.106
pull in a mass of Canadian- a
clipper of Canadian weather

00:09:16.106 --> 00:09:19.058
coming in from the polar front
here,

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:21.480
is actually generated by this
structure,

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.340
and it's wobbly.
 

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.178
Okay?
 

00:09:24.178 --> 00:09:27.105
In an idealized world this is
all smooth, and these lines are

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:28.080
clean and whatnot.
 

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.371
But, in fact,
the surface of the planet has

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:33.410
got stuff on it,
like continents and oceans,

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.340
and as this stuff moves in its
circulation pattern,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.250
both north and south,
and west to east,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.740
around the Northern Hemisphere,
it wobbles,

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.407
because it's been deflected by
local perturbations like

00:09:46.407 --> 00:09:47.840
mountain ranges and oceans.
 

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:57.666
So out of this you get patterns
of wind that in fact have--well

00:09:57.666 --> 00:10:02.408
now but they not only currently
generate weather.

00:10:02.408 --> 00:10:07.346
You can really only understand
say the history of the last 8 or

00:10:07.346 --> 00:10:11.326
10,000 years of human
civilization on the planet by

00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:15.149
realizing that the people who
were trading,

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:20.265
and were using boats to move,
were relying on the fact that

00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:22.509
at about 35,
40º north,

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:25.822
you can count on a west wind;
at about 20º

00:10:25.822 --> 00:10:29.028
north you can count on a trade
wind;

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:31.269
and that repeats in the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:35.493
And this is actually--these
trades here, over in the Indian

00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:39.788
Ocean, were what drove the trade
between India and the Roman

00:10:39.788 --> 00:10:41.500
Empire;
things like that.

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.413
So you should think of the
planet as being covered

00:10:48.413 --> 00:10:51.460
with--these are really very thin
sheets.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.701
When you think,
for example,

00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:55.230
that we're looking here
probably at 3 or 4000 miles,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.048
4 or 5000 kilometers,
and the depth of this cell is

00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:04.000
actually only about 5 to 10
kilometers.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So it's a very thin cell,
which is rotating like that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.226
Now if there weren't any
continents, you'd end up with

00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:15.480
something that looked like
Jupiter.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.610
Okay, Jupiter has these nice
neat bands that go around,

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.269
and it is a bit--it's not the
perfect,

00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:27.149
smooth Hadley cell picture that
I was showing you,

00:11:27.149 --> 00:11:29.779
but still that's quite a tight
band there.

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:31.700
And these are rotating cells.
 

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.830
Jupiter's bigger.
 

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.320
It's got a few more of them
than the earth does.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.397
The earth, by the way,
sitting on this picture is--oh,

00:11:40.397 --> 00:11:42.090
it's about that big.
 

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.379
&gt;
 

00:11:43.379 --> 00:11:44.429
So this is a lot bigger.
 

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.386
Because the earth has the
continents and the oceans,

00:11:51.386 --> 00:11:55.418
you don't get that smooth
picture in a shot from space,

00:11:55.418 --> 00:11:57.360
looking at the clouds.
 

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:01.667
You see a lot of swirls and
vortexes that are being caused

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.009
by these local perturbations.
 

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.039
Right here you've got the
African continent coming down;

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.139
you've got Antarctica down here.
 

00:12:09.139 --> 00:12:16.610
This is 40 to 60 south;
clear ocean all the way around

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.480
the planet;
winds blowing in this direction;

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.277
they can go all the way around
the planet with unobstructed

00:12:22.277 --> 00:12:25.267
ocean, just about the whole way,
except maybe just from the tip

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:26.278
of South America.
 

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:30.870
This is where you can get open
ocean waves that are up to 100

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.629
feet, 30 meters high.
 

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:34.201
And, of course,
this is also where the

00:12:34.201 --> 00:12:36.070
Whitbread Round the World race
goes down,

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.845
so that people can go really
fast around the globe and take

00:12:39.845 --> 00:12:43.230
their life in their hands in
pretty rough weather.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:47.841
So the earth doesn't really
have the idealized model of

00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:52.538
climate that I've shown you in
the previous pictures.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.917
It's more chaotic,
but there's still a pattern

00:12:54.917 --> 00:12:57.566
there;
and I want to emphasize now

00:12:57.566 --> 00:12:59.379
some of the patterns.
 

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.940
So, of course,
heat's being moved.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.759
Basically what's going on is
that heat's being moved from the

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.975
equator,
towards the poles,

00:13:06.975 --> 00:13:10.090
simply by physical chemical
forces,

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:13.250
to try to equalize the heat
gradient that's coming in from

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.219
the sun,
and that's done by wind and by

00:13:16.219 --> 00:13:16.769
water.
 

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:21.725
Now as a packet of air or water
moves towards the poles,

00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:25.418
it's coming with higher radio
velocity.

00:13:25.418 --> 00:13:29.509
Just think about the difference
in the diameter of the spinning

00:13:29.509 --> 00:13:32.149
earth at the equator and at the
poles.

00:13:32.149 --> 00:13:39.332
At the equator the diameter of
the planet is roughly 8000

00:13:39.332 --> 00:13:42.591
miles;
so the radius is about 4000

00:13:42.591 --> 00:13:43.168
miles.
 

00:13:43.168 --> 00:13:47.221
And as you move a packet of air
or water up towards the pole,

00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:50.798
by the time it gets to the
pole, the diameter is 0.

00:13:50.798 --> 00:13:51.188
Okay?
 

00:13:51.188 --> 00:13:55.866
So in between--basically it's a
trigonometric function that's

00:13:55.866 --> 00:14:00.621
telling you what's the diameter
of the spinning object as I go

00:14:00.621 --> 00:14:01.480
north.
 

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:04.919
So if I'm coming from the
equator, and I'm headed north,

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:08.485
I have more angular momentum
than the ground under my feet

00:14:08.485 --> 00:14:10.048
that I'm moving onto.
 

00:14:10.048 --> 00:14:13.700
It's moving slower to the east
than I am moving.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:17.490
And if I'm standing at the
poles and I start going south,

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:20.946
the ground under my feet is
staring to move out from under

00:14:20.946 --> 00:14:23.556
me,
because I don't have as much

00:14:23.556 --> 00:14:25.000
angular momentum.
 

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.032
So what that will do is it will
take a packet of air or water

00:14:31.032 --> 00:14:35.620
that moves toward the equator,
it's coming down with lower

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:39.428
radial velocity,
and it will be accelerated to

00:14:39.428 --> 00:14:40.450
the west.
 

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.962
That apparent force--and by the
way, so going north you'll be

00:14:43.962 --> 00:14:46.323
accelerated eastward;
coming south you'll be

00:14:46.323 --> 00:14:48.629
accelerated westward,
in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:50.100
This is an apparent force.
 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.427
Okay?
 

00:14:50.427 --> 00:14:54.422
It's called the Coriolis force,
and it's shaping the direction

00:14:54.422 --> 00:14:57.827
of major ocean currents,
and it's also shaping things

00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:00.620
like the trade winds;
and you'll see in a minute that

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.029
it shapes the way that
hurricanes spin.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.115
So I'd like you to take just--I
want to make sure that you get

00:15:09.115 --> 00:15:11.696
this, and I'm going to ask,
in a minute,

00:15:11.696 --> 00:15:13.879
if one of you can explain it.
 

00:15:13.879 --> 00:15:14.153
Okay?
 

00:15:14.153 --> 00:15:17.450
So can you just take a minute
and explain it to your partner,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.470
how the Coriolis force works,
and what's really going on

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:21.019
here.
 

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:24.190
It's a piece of
three-dimensional geometry,

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:27.667
and basically it's driven by
the fact that the earth is

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:31.532
spinning on its axis and things
are moving north and south on

00:15:31.532 --> 00:15:33.399
the surface of this ball.
 

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:34.870
Okay?
 

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.120
 One or two minutes.
 

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:49.058
&lt;&lt;Students confer with
one another&gt;&gt;

00:15:49.058 --> 00:15:52.610
&lt;&lt;Professor interacts
with one student&gt;&gt;

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:54.379
Prof: Do you want to
explain it to me?

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:57.620
Student:  I need a
picture;

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.419
I'm not very good with the
words here.

00:16:00.419 --> 00:16:00.860
Prof: Come on.
 

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:15.549
So here's a packet moving north.
 

00:16:15.549 --> 00:16:17.558
Student:  Okay.
 

00:16:17.558 --> 00:16:21.450
Prof: Let's take a slice
through the equator here,

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.620
and what you'd see inside here
is a circle,

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:31.855
that has a radius of 4000
miles, and if I do a slice up

00:16:31.855 --> 00:16:34.923
here,
it has a radius of say 2000

00:16:34.923 --> 00:16:35.480
miles.
 

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.639
Student:  Right.
 

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.769
Prof: Okay?
 

00:16:37.769 --> 00:16:41.169
So in 24 hours,
this thing is spinning very

00:16:41.169 --> 00:16:44.043
rapidly;
it's got 1000 miles an hour

00:16:44.043 --> 00:16:46.259
angular velocity,
down here.

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:47.080
Right?
 

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:53.538
Up here it has--let's see,
this is 4 times 3 1/2;

00:16:53.538 --> 00:16:57.590
instead of 24,000 miles
diameter, this is about 12,000

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:58.889
miles diameter.
 

00:16:58.889 --> 00:17:02.905
So it's only got 500 miles
angular velocity,

00:17:02.905 --> 00:17:03.840
up here.
 

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.207
So this is coming with 1000
miles angular velocity,

00:17:07.207 --> 00:17:10.979
up into an area where the
ground under its feet is moving

00:17:10.979 --> 00:17:13.000
500 miles per hour slower.
 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.970
So it's going to go like this.
 

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:16.960
Student:  Ah.
 

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.568
Prof: Got it?
 

00:17:18.568 --> 00:17:19.298
Student:  Yeah,
it helped.

00:17:19.298 --> 00:17:20.490
Prof: Does the picture
help?

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.838
Student:  Yes it does.
 

00:17:22.838 --> 00:17:24.098
&lt;&lt;Professor addresses the
class&gt;&gt;

00:17:24.098 --> 00:17:27.016
Prof: Okay,
I just learned that the picture

00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:27.788
is helpful.
 

00:17:27.788 --> 00:17:32.088
Okay, I'm going to do the
picture again for you.

00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:35.559
Actually maybe one of you can
come up and help me do it.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:38.180
Anybody want to help me?
 

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.508
Anybody feeling brave this
morning, bold,

00:17:41.508 --> 00:17:43.088
life threatening?
 

00:17:43.088 --> 00:17:44.289
Get up at the board with the
professor.

00:17:47.299 --> 00:17:49.920
Okay, here's the planet.
 

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.000
Here's the north/south axis of
the planet.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.328
Here's the equator.
 

00:17:56.328 --> 00:18:01.876
The circumference of the earth
at the equator is about 24,000

00:18:01.876 --> 00:18:04.057
miles,
and the earth is turning around

00:18:04.057 --> 00:18:06.962
once per day,
which means that a packet of

00:18:06.962 --> 00:18:09.617
air or water,
which is sitting at the

00:18:09.617 --> 00:18:13.019
equator, is moving east at about
1000 miles per hour.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:18.890
We're going to ship it north.
 

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.538
Okay?
 

00:18:19.538 --> 00:18:21.950
It's going to be carrying heat
toward the pole.

00:18:25.318 --> 00:18:31.125
We choose a convenient spot to
take another slice of the earth

00:18:31.125 --> 00:18:36.358
where the circumference of the
earth is 12,000 miles.

00:18:36.358 --> 00:18:42.519
This chunk of ground is moving
at 500 miles per hour.

00:18:42.519 --> 00:18:46.130
So as this pack of air goes
north, the ground underneath it,

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:49.422
by the time it's gotten up
here, is going 500 miles per

00:18:49.422 --> 00:18:51.383
hour,
towards the east,

00:18:51.383 --> 00:18:53.029
slower than it is.
 

00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:58.574
So what it does is it overtakes
the ground that's underneath it,

00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:00.950
and it bends to the east.
 

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:02.880
Okay?
 

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.630
And you can just play that back
and forth in your head.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.910
You can go from the north to
the south.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.588
You can do it in the Southern
Hemisphere;

00:19:07.588 --> 00:19:10.539
it'll work in the other
direction.

00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:11.329
Any questions on that?
 

00:19:15.528 --> 00:19:17.728
In order to see it,
you actually have to break the

00:19:17.728 --> 00:19:19.952
motion of the planet down,
in your head,

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:24.000
and put yourself in the shoes
of something which is moving

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.210
north or south,
and essentially what happens is

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.450
at the ground you either exceed
the speed of the ground

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:32.818
underneath you,
or the ground goes out from

00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:36.880
under your feet,
if you're going south.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.990
So that's basically the
Coriolis force.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.880
I once had to explain this in
German,

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.644
and I was just learning German,
and instead of saying "the

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.304
earth spins",
which is okay in English,

00:19:49.304 --> 00:19:51.308
I said, "die Erde
spinnt" in German,

00:19:51.308 --> 00:19:53.240
which means that the world is
crazy.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.808
They loved it.
 

00:19:55.808 --> 00:19:59.000
It was totally wrong,
but they loved it.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.558
Okay, the result of this is
that if these motions--

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:07.096
you know, so here you've got
the Coriolis Force taking the

00:20:07.096 --> 00:20:09.190
Kuroshio Current and bending it
to the east,

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:11.470
as it goes north,
and then when it comes down the

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.368
West Coast as the California
Current,

00:20:13.368 --> 00:20:17.623
it gets bent to the west,
and in each of the hemispheres

00:20:17.623 --> 00:20:22.338
you establish a rotation in the
ocean that looks like this.

00:20:22.338 --> 00:20:25.319
Here in the south you have
water which is flowing north;

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:27.440
it's getting bent to the west.
 

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.278
You've got water flowing to the
south, it's getting bent to the

00:20:30.278 --> 00:20:30.598
east.
 

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:34.958
So you get counter-clockwise in
the Southern Hemisphere and

00:20:34.958 --> 00:20:37.890
clockwise in the Northern
Hemisphere.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.650
Now on top of this,
just as I showed you for the

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.644
Hadley cells in the atmosphere,
there's an important

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:46.640
three-dimensional cell structure
in the oceans.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.791
So north of the Antarctic
continent there's a place where

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:54.868
the cold surface water of the
Antarctic gets- sinks,

00:20:54.868 --> 00:20:57.204
at the Antarctic
convergence--it's down about

00:20:57.204 --> 00:20:59.506
here--
and it then forms a cell which

00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:03.384
creeps along the floors of the
major oceans and then comes back

00:21:03.384 --> 00:21:03.759
up.
 

00:21:07.358 --> 00:21:11.874
There's a very important spot
where water from the Arctic

00:21:11.874 --> 00:21:16.146
Ocean, coming down from
Greenland, is sinking near the

00:21:16.146 --> 00:21:17.838
Gulf Stream here.
 

00:21:17.838 --> 00:21:21.230
And it's one of the real
current issues in global warming

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.318
as to whether or not this point
up here or this--

00:21:24.318 --> 00:21:28.587
actually it's not a point--this
whole sheet of sinking water is

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.308
going to remain stable.
 

00:21:30.308 --> 00:21:32.759
Because if it doesn't remain
stable,

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:36.055
and this moves south,
then the Gulf Stream will get

00:21:36.055 --> 00:21:39.773
blocked and basically England,
France and Spain are going to

00:21:39.773 --> 00:21:42.916
end up with a climate which is
like that of Northern Canada;

00:21:42.916 --> 00:21:43.769
very quickly.
 

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:48.250
That is something that could
happen in a couple of years,

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:49.930
if this thing tips.
 

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.685
So understanding that kind of
movement actually has big

00:21:53.685 --> 00:21:56.236
implications,
for society and for the people

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:58.771
who live in these places,
who are in the hundreds of

00:21:58.771 --> 00:21:59.250
millions.
 

00:22:02.509 --> 00:22:05.142
Now there are just--I want to
show you two things about the

00:22:05.142 --> 00:22:05.960
general pattern.
 

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.750
This is just repeating the
overall pattern on the planet.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.329
We get hurricanes roughly where
there are trade winds,

00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:17.046
and we get them both in the
Northern and in the Southern

00:22:17.046 --> 00:22:18.058
Hemisphere.
 

00:22:18.058 --> 00:22:21.291
And then right at the equator
we get El Niño,

00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:22.368
in the Pacific.
 

00:22:22.368 --> 00:22:24.618
And I want to show you a little
bit about hurricanes and a

00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:27.888
little bit about El Niño,
because those are two of the

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:31.464
sort of large-scale weather
patterns that occur on the

00:22:31.464 --> 00:22:32.140
planet.
 

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.586
So this question here:
Why do cyclones turn

00:22:34.586 --> 00:22:37.324
counter-clockwise in the
Northern Hemisphere and

00:22:37.324 --> 00:22:40.380
clockwise in the Southern,
is a bit puzzling,

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:44.617
because I have just shown you
that if you take a packet of air

00:22:44.617 --> 00:22:48.837
or water and you ship it north,
it's going to result in a

00:22:48.837 --> 00:22:52.915
clockwise circulation in the
north and a counter-clockwise

00:22:52.915 --> 00:22:54.920
circulation in the south.
 

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.900
And yet here is a nice photo
from space of Hurricane Katrina

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.828
starting to go over Florida,
before it hits New Orleans;

00:23:00.828 --> 00:23:03.798
Cyclone Larry,
equally destructive,

00:23:03.798 --> 00:23:06.769
plowing into Northern
Australia.

00:23:06.769 --> 00:23:09.952
And you can see quite clearly
that Hurricane Katrina is

00:23:09.952 --> 00:23:12.960
counter-clockwise and Cyclone
Larry is clockwise.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.618
And that looks puzzling,
but here's the answer.

00:23:16.618 --> 00:23:19.890
If you take a standard packet
of air,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.838
moving south in the Northern
Hemisphere,

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:24.440
hitting something like
Hurricane Katrina,

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.349
it will come down and it will
take this low,

00:23:27.349 --> 00:23:30.180
and it will spin it.
 

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:35.042
And if you have this as a set
of clockwise forces,

00:23:35.042 --> 00:23:38.615
operating on a low,
they will spin it

00:23:38.615 --> 00:23:40.798
counter-clockwise.
 

00:23:40.798 --> 00:23:44.382
And the same thing operating in
the Southern Hemisphere will

00:23:44.382 --> 00:23:47.842
spin a cyclone in the Southern
Hemisphere into a clockwise

00:23:47.842 --> 00:23:48.450
shape.
 

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:53.220
So really it's an interesting
problem of figure and ground,

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.338
or just what perspective are
you standing in,

00:23:55.338 --> 00:23:57.871
when you're trying to figure
out why the thing is spinning

00:23:57.871 --> 00:23:58.358
that way.
 

00:23:58.358 --> 00:24:04.178
Because basically it is being
operated on by external Coriolis

00:24:04.178 --> 00:24:09.519
forces that are generating the
antagonistic movement,

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:12.480
the unexpected movement in the
structure,

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:16.123
but it results in very
important consequences for

00:24:16.123 --> 00:24:20.068
anybody that's in the path of
one of these things.

00:24:20.068 --> 00:24:24.133
So that's basically the
explanation of why we see a

00:24:24.133 --> 00:24:28.440
counter-intuitive kind of spin
on these big storms.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.068
Now about El Niño.
 

00:24:30.068 --> 00:24:33.432
I think El Niño actually
is an extremely interesting and

00:24:33.432 --> 00:24:34.410
neat phenomenon.
 

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.943
It has huge implications,
and it drives weather patterns

00:24:37.943 --> 00:24:43.470
in fact over much of the planet;
not just at the equator.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:48.417
Under normal conditions
basically what's going on is

00:24:48.417 --> 00:24:52.327
that you have these,
the Kuroshio Current in the

00:24:52.327 --> 00:24:54.775
northern Pacific,
which is coming down off of

00:24:54.775 --> 00:24:58.258
California and Mexico,
and then going west along the

00:24:58.258 --> 00:24:58.990
equator.
 

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.288
You've got the Humboldt Current
in the southern Pacific,

00:25:01.288 --> 00:25:03.884
which is coming north,
along the coast of Chile and

00:25:03.884 --> 00:25:05.957
Peru,
and then curving out to the

00:25:05.957 --> 00:25:09.270
west, driven in those big
clockwise Northern Hemisphere

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.769
gyres and counter-clockwise
Southern Hemisphere gyres.

00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:18.078
And what they're doing--because
they have a continent more or

00:25:18.078 --> 00:25:22.029
less to the right here--
they are picking up the water

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:25.470
and shoving it offshore,
and that's causing the lower

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.373
bottom water to well up,
and they are shoving the warm

00:25:29.373 --> 00:25:31.598
surface water out to the west.
 

00:25:31.598 --> 00:25:35.662
And that causes a big buildup
of warm water,

00:25:35.662 --> 00:25:39.631
which is out about at Guam in
the Marianas,

00:25:39.631 --> 00:25:43.598
so--or all the way to the
Philippines.

00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:47.871
And this pile of warm water is
actually about a meter higher

00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:50.838
than the water in the eastern
Pacific,

00:25:50.838 --> 00:25:53.970
and it's being held there by
the currents and the winds.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:56.806
So it's actually,
over a distance of about 7 or

00:25:56.806 --> 00:25:59.441
8000 miles,
it's picking the surface of the

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:02.299
ocean up and it's stacking it up
a meter higher,

00:26:02.299 --> 00:26:04.630
out to the west, in the Pacific.
 

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:07.618
Now under El Niño
conditions,

00:26:07.618 --> 00:26:10.410
what happens is that the
currents break down,

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:13.454
and when the currents break
down, the force that was holding

00:26:13.454 --> 00:26:16.140
the water higher in the western
Pacific goes away.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.670
And what does the water do?
 

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:22.182
It falls downhill,
it flows back to the eastern

00:26:22.182 --> 00:26:27.969
Pacific, covering the eastern
Pacific up with a layer of hot

00:26:27.969 --> 00:26:28.950
water.
 

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:31.358
This has all kinds of
consequences.

00:26:31.358 --> 00:26:36.833
One of the consequences is that
warm water evaporates more than

00:26:36.833 --> 00:26:40.267
cold water,
and so rainfall increases,

00:26:40.267 --> 00:26:44.935
in the eastern Pacific,
and cells that carry a lot of

00:26:44.935 --> 00:26:50.490
water will then get blown into
places like Mexico and Arizona.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:53.571
And during El Niño
conditions you'll get much

00:26:53.571 --> 00:26:56.048
heavier rainfall in the American
West,

00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.759
and all the way through to the
Mississippi Valley,

00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:01.960
than you will during normal
conditions.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.910
But another very important
thing happens.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.558
This covers up the upwelling.
 

00:27:07.558 --> 00:27:09.655
It covers up the cold water
that was coming up from the

00:27:09.655 --> 00:27:12.201
bottom of the ocean,
and that cold water that was

00:27:12.201 --> 00:27:15.801
coming up from the bottom of the
ocean is carrying with it all

00:27:15.801 --> 00:27:17.160
kinds of fertilizer.
 

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:20.227
Basically the bottom of the
ocean has been receiving the

00:27:20.227 --> 00:27:23.294
dead bodies of algae and
zooplankton and everything else

00:27:23.294 --> 00:27:24.410
for a long time.
 

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.596
There's been a lot of nitrogen
and phosphate building up down

00:27:27.596 --> 00:27:30.464
there, and under normal
conditions that's being carried

00:27:30.464 --> 00:27:31.740
up by the upwelling.
 

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.832
And when El Niño rolls
in, it covers it up,

00:27:34.832 --> 00:27:37.230
turns off the fertilization
process.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:40.636
The alga production goes down,
zooplankton production goes

00:27:40.636 --> 00:27:43.923
down, the fish don't have so
much to eat and the fishery

00:27:43.923 --> 00:27:45.118
stocks collapse.
 

00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:48.118
So once every ten or eleven
years,

00:27:48.118 --> 00:27:52.519
when this happens,
the great fisheries of the

00:27:52.519 --> 00:27:56.858
Eastern Pacific collapse,
and that means that thousands

00:27:56.858 --> 00:28:01.400
of fishermen go out of work;
it means that sea birds starve.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.641
And you should think of the
whole Pacific Ocean as kind of

00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:10.180
ringing like a bell on about a
ten or eleven year interval.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.383
And since the Pacific Ocean
occupies roughly half the

00:28:13.383 --> 00:28:15.711
planet,
that means there are signatures

00:28:15.711 --> 00:28:18.859
of this that reverberate all the
way around the planet,

00:28:18.859 --> 00:28:22.140
on about a ten year interval.
 

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.635
When I was doing my Ph.D.
 

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:26.390
on the evolution of mosquito
fish in Hawaii,

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:30.653
I had sixty years of records of
the level of sugar plantation

00:28:30.653 --> 00:28:33.862
reservoirs in Hawaii,
and I did a time series

00:28:33.862 --> 00:28:37.650
analysis on it and I picked up
two very dominant signals.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:40.021
There was a short frequency
signal, which was the

00:28:40.021 --> 00:28:42.838
weekends--that's when people
went home on the weekends;

00:28:42.838 --> 00:28:45.779
so the reservoirs didn't
fluctuate on the weekends.

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:48.874
But there was an eleven-year
signal that was El Niño,

00:28:48.874 --> 00:28:51.759
and it was the biggest,
strongest signal in the data.

00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:53.689
So up in Hawaii,
which is really quite a ways

00:28:53.689 --> 00:28:54.580
away--
on this map,

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.192
Hawaii would be up off the map,
up here somewhere--this is

00:28:58.192 --> 00:29:02.598
making a big impact on the
ten-year rainfall record,

00:29:02.598 --> 00:29:06.460
and it's doing so in Arizona
and New Mexico and Texas,

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:09.390
and California as well.
 

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.210
Okay, so that's El Niño.
 

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.868
And to see what it looks like.
 

00:29:12.868 --> 00:29:17.365
This is a NOA picture of the
temperature of the Pacific,

00:29:17.365 --> 00:29:22.269
going from the eastern Pacific
out to the western Pacific.

00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:23.519
And these are different years.
 

00:29:23.519 --> 00:29:27.470
So this is starting in 1986 and
going up to 2001,

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:30.318
and this year,
right here, where you see a big

00:29:30.318 --> 00:29:33.535
tongue of warm water,
29º Centigrade,

00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:38.618
pushing all the way back in to
the eastern Pacific is 1997;

00:29:38.618 --> 00:29:41.130
one of the major El Niño
events.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.605
And, in fact,
there is right now,

00:29:42.605 --> 00:29:45.509
I think in the last year or so,
another El Niño event.

00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:46.470
Yes, Myra?
 

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.710
Student: 
&gt;

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.482
Prof: There appears to
have been this kind of cyclicity

00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:58.380
in the Pacific for as long back
as we can see in the records.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:01.582
I think that the things that
would probably make it break

00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:03.470
down are plate tectonic events.
 

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.632
I do not know if El Niño
was regular before the Isthmus

00:30:06.632 --> 00:30:09.068
of Panama formed about ten
million years ago.

00:30:09.068 --> 00:30:09.869
I suspect it would've been
different.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.588
And this is just that--this is
the actual temperature,

00:30:17.588 --> 00:30:20.509
and then this is the deviation
from the normal.

00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:23.208
And, by the way,
they call a year that's sort of

00:30:23.208 --> 00:30:25.390
really super normal,
La Niña.

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.073
So this is a La Niña and
this is El Niño,

00:30:28.073 --> 00:30:28.670
down here.
 

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:30.724
So you should think of La
Niña as being cold water

00:30:30.724 --> 00:30:33.509
in the eastern Pacific,
and El Niño as being hot

00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:45.940
water in the eastern Pacific,
with all of its consequences.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.799
In La Niña you've got
the upwelling going,

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:49.390
and in El Niño it's
interrupted;

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:52.993
and of course that would be
happening basically right along

00:30:52.993 --> 00:30:53.430
here.
 

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.943
But upwelling is normal in much
of the planet,

00:30:56.943 --> 00:30:59.990
and it happens along coastal
margins.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.528
So the areas here that are
indicated in red is where cold,

00:31:04.528 --> 00:31:08.450
deep water is being moved to
the surface by various forces,

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.480
and in the process is
fertilizing the surface layer,

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.157
and that's driving the
productivity of the world's

00:31:14.157 --> 00:31:14.650
oceans.
 

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.680
So people, of course,
have discovered this;

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.474
I mean, one could have made a
theoretical argument,

00:31:21.474 --> 00:31:24.436
but in fact the world's
fishermen discovered this long

00:31:24.436 --> 00:31:26.730
before there was any climatic
theory.

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:30.490
And the greatest productivity
in the world's oceans are in

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:33.592
places like the North Sea,
the Benguela Current,

00:31:33.592 --> 00:31:37.700
and the West Coast of Africa;
the coast of Peru with its

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.306
gigantic anchovy fishery;
West Coast of North America

00:31:41.306 --> 00:31:44.098
with tuna and sardines and
things like that;

00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:48.236
and you can see a few other
spots around the world that are

00:31:48.236 --> 00:31:49.519
very productive.
 

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.720
Fishing is mighty good in New
Zealand.

00:31:54.068 --> 00:31:57.557
The way this works is through a
combination of offshore winds

00:31:57.557 --> 00:31:59.009
and the Coriolis force.
 

00:31:59.009 --> 00:32:01.480
So let's first do the offshore
wind.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.790
If you have any body of land,
and you have wind blowing

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.782
offshore,
it pushes the surface water

00:32:08.782 --> 00:32:13.151
off, and just in order for
gravity to equilibrate the water

00:32:13.151 --> 00:32:16.787
pressure,
it's going to therefore pull up

00:32:16.787 --> 00:32:19.358
deep water at the shore line.
 

00:32:19.358 --> 00:32:24.390
And if any of you live on the
West Coast,

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.650
I think you know this perfectly
well,

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:31.517
because you know that very
often the water on the shoreline

00:32:31.517 --> 00:32:35.210
of the West Coast is colder than
the air,

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.980
and it is going to produce fog.
 

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:41.598
And all the way from roughly
Santa Barbara up to Juneau,

00:32:41.598 --> 00:32:44.823
you have fog banks,
which is because you have cold

00:32:44.823 --> 00:32:48.378
water hitting warm air;
it's that cold upwelling water

00:32:48.378 --> 00:32:50.868
hitting the warm air that makes
the fog,

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:55.029
which is so characteristic of
the West Coast of the United

00:32:55.029 --> 00:32:56.953
States,
and is also characteristic,

00:32:56.953 --> 00:33:00.940
by the way,
of the West Coast of Namibia.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.901
There are even some beetles
that live in the desert of

00:33:03.901 --> 00:33:07.588
Namibia that are specialized for
catching the fog on their feet.

00:33:07.588 --> 00:33:10.974
They stand on their heads and
they put their feet up and they

00:33:10.974 --> 00:33:14.021
catch water with their feet,
because it doesn't rain in

00:33:14.021 --> 00:33:14.700
Namibia.
 

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.273
Now if we were to look at say
the coast of Oregon,

00:33:19.273 --> 00:33:24.130
and we have wind or current
which is coming south;

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:27.440
we're in the Northern
Hemisphere, we're going south.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.898
The Coriolis force is working,
and because we're coming south

00:33:30.898 --> 00:33:33.707
we're going to be--
we have less angular momentum

00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:36.959
than the earth under our feet,
and therefore it's going to be

00:33:36.959 --> 00:33:38.250
diverted out to the west.
 

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:41.588
That means that there's going
to be a tendency for the

00:33:41.588 --> 00:33:44.108
Coriolis force to suck water
offshore.

00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:46.868
And the wind or the current
could be coming south,

00:33:46.868 --> 00:33:51.093
but the net vector of movement
of surface water will be

00:33:51.093 --> 00:33:55.009
deflected off to the right,
by the Coriolis force,

00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:58.163
and pulled offshore,
and so you're going to get cold

00:33:58.163 --> 00:34:01.462
bottom water,
welling up to the surface and

00:34:01.462 --> 00:34:03.210
fertilizing things.
 

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:08.239
Okay, that's a little bit about
how the climate machine is

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.268
working in the ocean.
 

00:34:10.268 --> 00:34:14.320
Now let's take a minute to look
at what it's doing to the biomes

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:18.112
on the surface of the planet,
on the terrestrial part of the

00:34:18.112 --> 00:34:18.820
planet.
 

00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:23.284
Ecologists have broken the
planet down into areas that

00:34:23.284 --> 00:34:28.338
basically look similar from the
structure of their ecological

00:34:28.338 --> 00:34:31.539
communities,
and are thought to be similar

00:34:31.539 --> 00:34:35.018
in terms of the general control
of ecological processes.

00:34:35.018 --> 00:34:37.530
So you've got ice sheets,
of course.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.650
Then you've got tundra.
 

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:43.469
In tundra you normally don't
see plants that are taller than,

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.190
oh, 10 or 20 centimeters.
 

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:49.527
You have things like dwarf
birch, lots of moss,

00:34:49.527 --> 00:34:51.320
things like that.
 

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.050
Often tundra is overlying
permafrost.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.552
Then you've got the taiga or
the northern coniferous forests,

00:34:59.552 --> 00:35:03.528
which stretch across much of
the high latitudes in the

00:35:03.528 --> 00:35:05.329
Northern Hemisphere.
 

00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:08.731
You can't really get to these
places in the Southern

00:35:08.731 --> 00:35:09.599
Hemisphere.
 

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:10.250
Okay?
 

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:13.572
Antarctica is too cold,
and Africa and Australia don't

00:35:13.572 --> 00:35:15.389
really go far enough south.
 

00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:18.592
There's a little bit of
replication of this in South

00:35:18.592 --> 00:35:22.110
America, but it's mostly a
question there of altitude.

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:27.673
Then you get some forests that
are extremely similar in Eastern

00:35:27.673 --> 00:35:30.773
North America,
across Western Europe and into

00:35:30.773 --> 00:35:33.929
Central Asia,
and in China and Manchuria,

00:35:33.929 --> 00:35:37.179
which is temperate broadleaf
forest.

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:41.023
You get similarities in the
rainforests of the Amazon and

00:35:41.023 --> 00:35:45.072
the Congo, and in Southeast
Asia, and in Northern Australia,

00:35:45.072 --> 00:35:46.239
and so forth.
 

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:50.032
There are, in other words,
these large biomes around the

00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:53.000
planet that are mainly shaped by
climate.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.199
And I'm just going to touch
quickly on two of them.

00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:59.800
One of them is the desert biome.
 

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:05.471
And one tends to find deserts
at about 30 North and about 30

00:36:05.471 --> 00:36:06.239
South.
 

00:36:06.239 --> 00:36:10.257
So, of course,
the Sahara and the Arabian

00:36:10.257 --> 00:36:12.768
Desert are at 30 North.
 

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:18.440
The deserts of Mexico and
Arizona are at about 30 North.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.079
The Chilean and Peruvian
deserts, the Atacama Desert,

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.760
are at about 30 South.
 

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.869
The Kalahari and the Namib are
at about 30 South,

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:33.179
and the Great Central Desert of
Australia is about 30 South.

00:36:33.179 --> 00:36:36.927
And remember,
this is where you have cold air

00:36:36.927 --> 00:36:37.780
falling.
 

00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.719
At the equator you have warm
air rising,

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:42.780
and where you have the deserts
you have cold air falling,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.170
and there's very little water
in that cold,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.230
dry air that's falling.
 

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.940
It's quite hot during the day
and it's cold at night.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:54.367
So, for example,
if you're in the hot desert of

00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:57.693
Central Australia,
and it's nightfall,

00:36:57.693 --> 00:37:00.989
on a nice clear night the
temperature will go,

00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:04.420
say in Fahrenheit,
from 80 or 90 degrees,

00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:09.280
down to freezing,
in about two or three hours.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:12.197
And so Aborigines learn to do
things like all sleep together

00:37:12.197 --> 00:37:13.039
in a big bunch.
 

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.476
The wet tropical forests are
about at the equator,

00:37:20.476 --> 00:37:25.063
where you have warm air rising;
warm, moisture-laden air is

00:37:25.063 --> 00:37:25.730
rising.
 

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.250
There are some interesting
twists on that.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.559
For example,
if you take a packet of air off

00:37:29.559 --> 00:37:32.460
the south Atlantic and you blow
it into the Amazon,

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.302
the Amazon actually will
transpire the moisture in that

00:37:37.302 --> 00:37:39.434
air;
the trees in the Amazon will

00:37:39.434 --> 00:37:42.900
transpire it,
so that by the time a packet of

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.842
rain,
that started here in the south

00:37:44.842 --> 00:37:46.389
Atlantic,
hits the Andes,

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.768
it's been rained out three
times.

00:37:48.768 --> 00:37:50.789
It's gone back up into the
atmosphere, made a cloud;

00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:52.760
gone down into the ground;
gone up into the atmosphere;

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.860
rained out, made a cloud.
 

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.639
And it's done that about,
on the average,

00:37:55.639 --> 00:37:57.599
three times by the time it hits
the Andes.

00:37:57.599 --> 00:38:01.050
So there's some interesting
local stuff going on.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.932
But roughly speaking,
you find the world's greatest

00:38:04.932 --> 00:38:09.050
biodiversity near the equator in
these rainforests.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:11.876
And so if we just take a look
at one of them,

00:38:11.876 --> 00:38:14.510
the Corcovado Rainforest in
Costa Rica;

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:18.478
and all of you are eligible to
go on an OTS course to Costa

00:38:18.478 --> 00:38:22.719
Rica, and as part of it you'll
probably go to the Corcovado.

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:26.757
Or, if you were lucky enough to
be in Rick Prum's class this

00:38:26.757 --> 00:38:29.108
semester,
you got taken by Rick,

00:38:29.108 --> 00:38:33.132
over spring break,
to Ecuador, where they logged

00:38:33.132 --> 00:38:36.219
450 species of birds in ten
days.

00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:40.657
And in that kind of habitat you
are going to run into extremely

00:38:40.657 --> 00:38:44.731
high species diversity,
and you're going to see all

00:38:44.731 --> 00:38:49.565
kinds of stuff that you just
never run into in the temperate

00:38:49.565 --> 00:38:50.630
latitudes.
 

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.779
So I strongly recommend a visit
to one of these places,

00:38:54.779 --> 00:38:56.469
if you possibly can.
 

00:38:56.469 --> 00:38:58.980
For a biologist it's pretty
much--this,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.170
and say going over a coral
reef, especially at night,

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:06.498
it's kind of like Christmas,
because every time you turn

00:39:06.498 --> 00:39:08.869
around the corner there's
another surprise under the tree

00:39:08.869 --> 00:39:09.969
&gt;
 

00:39:09.969 --> 00:39:13.155
and there's something beautiful
and strange that you've never

00:39:13.155 --> 00:39:13.900
seen before.
 

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:20.576
So this is the biological
consequence of a long period of

00:39:20.576 --> 00:39:24.175
fairly stable warm,
moist conditions,

00:39:24.175 --> 00:39:27.219
which are the ecological
theater that has allowed this

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:29.690
kind of evolutionary play to
take place.

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:36.878
If we look back in time,
there are a couple of things

00:39:36.878 --> 00:39:40.583
about say the last--
this is roughly the last

00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:44.347
fifty-million years,
from the Eocene up to the

00:39:44.347 --> 00:39:47.311
Holocene--
there are a couple of fairly

00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:51.753
neat things that have happened
in terms of the global pattern

00:39:51.753 --> 00:39:52.789
of climate.
 

00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:55.710
One of them is that if you go
back to Eocene,

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.547
when it was really quite warm,
and you had temperate forests

00:39:59.547 --> 00:40:02.280
that went right up to the Arctic
Ocean,

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.324
you can demonstrate that there
were large trees growing in

00:40:05.324 --> 00:40:09.056
Northern Greenland,
at a latitude where it was dark

00:40:09.056 --> 00:40:14.480
for nearly six months a year;
it was warm but it was dark.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.445
And that really is a rather
interesting comment on what

00:40:17.445 --> 00:40:20.583
trees are capable of;
that you could make a tree that

00:40:20.583 --> 00:40:24.059
would live in complete darkness,
not doing anything for six

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:27.393
months, and then turn back on
and become actually quite a tall

00:40:27.393 --> 00:40:29.501
forest;
these trees are a meter,

00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:32.559
two meters in diameter,
in Northern Greenland.

00:40:32.559 --> 00:40:35.757
So that's one kind of thing
that the historical look at

00:40:35.757 --> 00:40:37.179
ecology will give you.
 

00:40:37.179 --> 00:40:38.780
But there's another one,
which is really,

00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.559
I think, important for everyone
on the planet now,

00:40:42.559 --> 00:40:46.168
and that is that the Eocene,
Oligocene and Miocene were all

00:40:46.168 --> 00:40:48.813
pretty warm;
in fact, they were much warmer

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.530
than the earth currently is.
 

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.135
And when you look say at the
distribution of tropical

00:40:54.135 --> 00:40:57.117
forests--
which is in green--you can see

00:40:57.117 --> 00:41:01.335
that tropical forests covered
really most of the earth for

00:41:01.335 --> 00:41:04.961
tens of millions of years;
and compare that to their

00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:06.030
distribution now.
 

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.465
We're essentially in an
interglacial in the Pleistocene

00:41:09.465 --> 00:41:10.230
right now.
 

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.407
The planet is really much
colder than it has been,

00:41:13.407 --> 00:41:14.250
on average.
 

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:17.523
And you can see those sorts of
trends written in the

00:41:17.523 --> 00:41:20.539
distribution of the biomes
across the planet.

00:41:20.539 --> 00:41:26.400
And it would be terribly neat
to have a slow motion videotape,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.909
taken from a distant satellite,
over the last 65 million years,

00:41:30.909 --> 00:41:33.210
to see this kind of thing going
on.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:36.360
One would have to be,
of course, a bit patient.

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.929
So here are the things I want
you to remember about climate;

00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:44.610
organisms and the climate
machine of the planet.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.849
If all you know is the seasonal
pattern of temperatures,

00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:48.603
daylight and water
availability,

00:41:48.603 --> 00:41:51.715
you can predict a lot about
what you're going to find in

00:41:51.715 --> 00:41:54.769
terms of biomass,
in terms of biome;

00:41:54.769 --> 00:41:56.639
all that kind of stuff.
 

00:41:56.639 --> 00:42:01.405
I would like you to remember,
out of this lecture and out of

00:42:01.405 --> 00:42:04.797
your reading,
how mountains create rain and

00:42:04.797 --> 00:42:08.190
rain shadows and hot down-slope
winds.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.786
I'd like you to remember the
pattern of winds and currents,

00:42:11.786 --> 00:42:13.768
from the equator to the poles.
 

00:42:13.768 --> 00:42:18.380
I'd like you to remember how
the so-called Coriolis force

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.393
works;
how El Niño works,

00:42:20.393 --> 00:42:23.697
this wonderful thing of piling
up a meter high mountain of hot

00:42:23.697 --> 00:42:25.697
water,
in the Western Pacific,

00:42:25.697 --> 00:42:27.980
and then letting it fall back
down;

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:30.480
how ocean currents drive
upwelling;

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.063
and why cold,
nutrient-rich water will well

00:42:34.063 --> 00:42:37.989
up at the edge of a continent,
or an island;

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:42.659
and how the climate structures
the biomes on the planet.

00:42:42.659 --> 00:42:44.000
Okay.

00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.090
As you can see from the title
of today's lecture,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.981
"Habitats at Herculaneum
and Early Roman Interior

00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:13.505
Decoration,"
we're going to be concentrating

00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.927
once again,
at least in the first half of

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:18.777
the lecture,
on domestic architecture in

00:00:18.777 --> 00:00:19.610
Campania.
 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.520
We're going to look at several
houses in Herculaneum,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.039
and then we're going to move
from there to begin our

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.420
discussion of early Roman
interior decoration,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.490
namely the First and Second
Styles of Roman wall painting.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.799
And what you'll see makes them
particularly relevant to what

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.108
we've been discussing thus far
this term is the fact that in

00:00:41.108 --> 00:00:43.240
both the First and Second
Styles,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.800
architecture is depicted in
these paintings,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.435
and we're going to see some
very interesting relationships

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:52.815
between that and the built
monuments that we've talked

00:00:52.815 --> 00:00:54.920
about thus far this semester.
 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.362
Just to remind you of the
location of Herculaneum,

00:01:01.362 --> 00:01:04.671
which is usually called the
sister city of Pompeii,

00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:06.459
because of that locale.
 

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.560
We see it on the map here.
 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.328
Pompeii is down in this
location.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:16.037
Herculaneum is to the northeast
of Pompeii, closer to Naples

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:18.750
than Pompeii is,
as you can see.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.730
And note also the city of
Boscoreale,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.360
Boscoreale, which is located
between,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.438
almost equidistant -- a little
bit closer to Pompeii than

00:01:28.438 --> 00:01:30.819
Herculaneum --
but in between the two.

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.816
And I point it out to you now
because we're going to look at

00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:37.053
an important room,
with paintings,

00:01:37.053 --> 00:01:40.170
from the city of Boscoreale
today as well.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.105
Here you see a view,
a Google Earth flyover,

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:47.400
of Herculaneum,
as it looks today.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.480
It's very helpful because you
can see a couple of things here

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.510
that I want you to keep in mind,
as we look at this city.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.628
One, that although most of the
city of Pompeii has been

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.245
excavated,
only about a quarter or

00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:04.061
twenty-five percent of the city
of Herculaneum has been

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:04.980
excavated.
 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.168
So we have much less at
Herculaneum than we do for

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:11.421
Pompeii, and what we're missing,
for the most part,

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.438
is the public architecture.
 

00:02:13.438 --> 00:02:16.520
We don't have a great
amphitheater from Herculaneum.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.020
We don't have a theater and a
music hall complex.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.361
We think we might have part of
the basilica,

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:25.848
but we're not absolutely sure.
 

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:29.430
We don't have the great large
forum space that we have in

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.068
Pompeii.
 

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:33.289
So we're missing a lot of that
public architecture at

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:35.818
Herculaneum,
which gives us less of a sense

00:02:35.818 --> 00:02:37.900
of what the city was originally
like,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.312
at least in its public face,
although there's no doubt that

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:44.020
that material still lies beneath
the ground.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.792
So we have only a quarter of
the city, mostly the residential

00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:49.009
part of the city,
or part of the residential part

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.750
of the city.
 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.979
But there are several houses
there that are extremely--

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:59.293
give us, provide information,
especially about what was going

00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:04.430
on between the earthquake and
the eruption of Vesuvius,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.628
62 to 79, that are extremely
valuable in terms of giving us a

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:12.968
sense again of the evolution of
Roman domestic architecture.

00:03:12.968 --> 00:03:16.651
The other issue that this
particular view raises is the

00:03:16.651 --> 00:03:20.878
reason why Herculaneum is less
well excavated than Pompeii,

00:03:20.878 --> 00:03:23.860
and the reason for that has to
do--and you can see it well

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.920
here--
has to do with the fact that

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.970
the modern city grew up on top
of the ancient city.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.348
And they were able at one point
to clear part of it,

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:35.330
for excavation,
but they have not been able to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.590
clear the rest.
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.110
It's a political nightmare to
have to deal--

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.418
you have to relocate all the
people who live in this area and

00:03:42.418 --> 00:03:45.008
have lived in this area for a
very long time.

00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:47.289
That's politically a very
difficult thing to do.

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:49.000
It also is extremely costly.
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.210
So thus far only twenty-five
percent of Herculaneum revealed.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.050
Let's all hope that at some
point someday Italy can sort

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.612
this out and find a way to
excavate the rest of this

00:04:00.612 --> 00:04:02.218
extraordinary city.
 

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:06.235
You can see from this view that
I took as--this is one of the

00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:10.319
views that you get as you enter
the site, the current location

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.990
today.
 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.300
But I think you can see very
well here again what I'm talking

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.170
about: the relationship between
the ancient city,

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.899
lower ground level,
that has been unearthed through

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:20.610
excavation.
 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:23.980
You can see a peristyle court
of one of the houses here,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.839
for example.
 

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:29.321
But you can see the way in
which the modern city rings the

00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.012
site,
and again what a challenge it

00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:36.281
would be to remove that modern
city and to reveal the rest of

00:04:36.281 --> 00:04:37.350
Herculaneum.
 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.494
Here's another view where you
can also see some of the remains

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:43.959
of the ancient city,
of these residences and so on,

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:47.610
and their relationship to the
rest of the town.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.372
With regard to the history of
Herculaneum, it is very similar

00:04:51.372 --> 00:04:53.129
to the history of Pompeii.
 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.038
One difference is that the city
of Herculaneum was supposedly

00:04:58.038 --> 00:05:02.129
founded by Hercules,
hence its name Herculaneum.

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.387
But in other respects the
history again is quite

00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:06.290
comparable.
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.690
We know, for example,
that the city of Herculaneum

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.786
was overseen for awhile by that
same Italic tribe called the

00:05:13.786 --> 00:05:18.336
Oscans,
who were then conquered by the

00:05:18.336 --> 00:05:21.466
Samnites,
and the Samnites took over

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:22.350
Herculaneum.
 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.026
And it was during the Samnite
period in Herculaneum that we

00:05:26.026 --> 00:05:29.767
begin to see the same kind of
architectural development that

00:05:29.767 --> 00:05:31.480
we saw also in Pompeii.
 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.000
We also know that those in
Herculaneum,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.759
the citizens of Herculaneum,
the leaders of Herculaneum,

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.389
got involved in the Social
Wars, as did those in Pompeii,

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.853
and that the city of
Herculaneum was conquered by

00:05:44.853 --> 00:05:48.040
Rome in 89 B.C.,
in 89 B.C.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.009
So Herculaneum becomes a Roman
colony in 89 B.C.

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.269
Thereafter we know--and of
course at that point,

00:05:56.269 --> 00:05:58.384
just as in Pompeii,
the Romans begin to build

00:05:58.384 --> 00:06:00.019
buildings in the Roman manner.
 

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:03.910
From that point on we know
again comparable development.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.245
We know that at Herculaneum
they also witnessed that very

00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:11.706
serious earthquake,
an earthquake that also

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:16.060
destroyed significant parts of
the city of Herculaneum,

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.007
and they too went through that
frenzied seventeen-year period

00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:21.060
of rebuilding.
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.870
But again, just as at Pompeii,
it was for naught,

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.791
because the city of Herculaneum
was also covered by the ash and

00:06:29.791 --> 00:06:31.459
lava of Vesuvius.
 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:36.021
However, there's one major
difference that has to do with

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:38.709
the way that ash and lava fell.
 

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:42.629
We talked about the fact that
at Pompeii there was actually

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:47.339
quite a bit of notice,
that the ash and lava came down

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:51.668
on the city fairly gradually,
and that there was time for

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:54.069
people to escape,
and that most of them did,

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.144
except for those foolhardy
souls who decided to wait it

00:06:57.144 --> 00:06:59.877
out,
which we discussed a couple of

00:06:59.877 --> 00:07:00.939
lectures ago.
 

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:04.360
But in Herculaneum,
it happened much more rapidly,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.189
and in fact it became very
clear, very quickly,

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.670
that a huge blanket of lava was
headed toward the city.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.557
And needless to say,
that encouraged people to leave

00:07:15.557 --> 00:07:17.172
pronto,
and we thought,

00:07:17.172 --> 00:07:20.002
at least for a very long time,
that that's in fact what had

00:07:20.002 --> 00:07:23.156
happened,
that everybody had escaped the

00:07:23.156 --> 00:07:25.269
onslaught of Vesuvius.
 

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:30.255
What happened after that
blanket of lava engulfed the

00:07:30.255 --> 00:07:34.379
city is it hermetically sealed
the city,

00:07:34.379 --> 00:07:38.764
hermetically sealed the city,
in such a way that materials

00:07:38.764 --> 00:07:43.610
that have been lost at Pompeii
were preserved at Herculaneum.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.449
And the best example of that is
wood.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:47.839
We have almost no wood.
 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:51.269
Wood is not a material that
withstands the test of time

00:07:51.269 --> 00:07:54.127
terribly well,
and we have almost no wood from

00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:54.889
Pompeii.
 

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:57.214
But from the city of
Herculaneum, we have a

00:07:57.214 --> 00:08:00.494
considerable amount of wood,
and this just has to do with

00:08:00.494 --> 00:08:03.958
the fact again that the city was
so hermetically sealed by that

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.019
blanket of lava.
 

00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:08.517
And I can show you a few
examples of what survives in

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:08.990
wood.
 

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.377
For example,
this bed, or part of a bed,

00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:14.009
that's still preserved,
as you can see here,

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:15.540
with the wooden legs.
 

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.452
A wooden partition in one of
the houses, to divide one

00:08:19.452 --> 00:08:24.028
section, kind of like a modern
pogo wall, to divide one section

00:08:24.028 --> 00:08:26.540
of the structure from another.
 

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.802
You can see also the wooden
frames around the doors and

00:08:30.802 --> 00:08:34.038
around the windows are also
preserved,

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:37.515
as are these wooden beams that
you can see over the doorways

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:41.100
and over the windows--
mostly over the doorways--those

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:43.620
wooden beams also made out of
wood.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.298
And this is the most famous
example,

00:08:45.298 --> 00:08:48.072
and one that everybody sees as
you wander the streets of

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:50.779
Herculaneum,
the Casa a Graticcio,

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:54.172
which we see here --
and you can see that even the

00:08:54.172 --> 00:08:56.602
balcony,
which is made out of wood,

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:58.759
is extremely well preserved.
 

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:02.291
So this provides evidence that
we don't have from Pompeii

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.822
that's extremely valuable in
terms of understanding Roman

00:09:05.822 --> 00:09:07.210
building practice.
 

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:11.350
I mentioned already though that
we didn't think anyone--

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:15.792
we thought that all those who
lived in Herculaneum had escaped

00:09:15.792 --> 00:09:18.966
from Vesuvius,
but it turns out that was not

00:09:18.966 --> 00:09:20.168
in fact the case.
 

00:09:20.168 --> 00:09:25.822
As recently as the 1980s,
some archaeologists were doing

00:09:25.822 --> 00:09:32.710
some excavating down at the sea
wall of the city of Herculaneum,

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.970
and lo and behold,
they came upon a cache of

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.879
skeletons.
 

00:09:36.879 --> 00:09:39.500
And I show you some of those
skeletons here.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.758
And those skeletons are in the
same kinds of positions as the

00:09:42.758 --> 00:09:46.279
bodies that we saw at Pompeii,
in that clearly a number of

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:49.100
them have huddled together for
protection,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.580
futile protection as it turned
out.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:56.342
And here another one who's
raising himself or herself in an

00:09:56.342 --> 00:10:01.600
attempt to survive somehow this
awful event that has occurred.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.014
We find these skeletons--and
they found these skeletons near

00:10:05.014 --> 00:10:08.599
the sea wall,
and what they've concluded from

00:10:08.599 --> 00:10:10.123
this,
two things: one,

00:10:10.123 --> 00:10:13.528
again the difference in the
lava that fell on Herculaneum.

00:10:13.528 --> 00:10:15.710
You can see that it not only
preserved wood,

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:19.447
it also preserved bone,
which is why the skeletons are

00:10:19.447 --> 00:10:23.443
still visible here,
whereas at Pompeii everything

00:10:23.443 --> 00:10:25.899
decomposed,
at Pompeii.

00:10:25.899 --> 00:10:27.778
So the situation again quite
different.

00:10:27.778 --> 00:10:30.844
But they've also been able to
determine that what clearly

00:10:30.844 --> 00:10:33.854
happened here is again because
there was so much notice,

00:10:33.854 --> 00:10:34.730
people fled.
 

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.730
And where did they flee?
 

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.059
They fled toward the water,
because they were right on the

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:40.946
sea,
they had a lot of boats,

00:10:40.946 --> 00:10:44.390
and the hope was that they
could ferry everybody out from

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.129
the city.
 

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:47.220
And for the most part they were
successful,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.265
but there was a certain group
that unfortunately got left

00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:52.854
behind,
and it was their remains that

00:10:52.854 --> 00:10:54.970
were discovered in the 1980s.
 

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.787
It's amazing what these bodies
can tell us about some of the

00:10:58.787 --> 00:11:02.365
people who lived there,
and I'll just give you a little

00:11:02.365 --> 00:11:04.629
sense of a couple of the
storylines.

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:09.133
Here is the skeleton of a
woman, and you can see that this

00:11:09.133 --> 00:11:11.644
woman has--
if you look very closely at her

00:11:11.644 --> 00:11:14.456
left hand,
two of her fingers--you can see

00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:17.200
she has rings on two of her
fingers,

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.379
and those are larger views of
those very rings.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:23.769
Two rings with green and red
stones.

00:11:23.769 --> 00:11:25.219
The red stone,
you can see,

00:11:25.219 --> 00:11:27.169
has a little bird depicted on
it.

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:28.178
These were her rings.
 

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:30.307
Consequently the archaeologists
call her "the ring

00:11:30.307 --> 00:11:32.889
lady";
or it should be "the rings

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:33.690
lady."
 

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.820
But here she is with her two
rings.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.408
And you can see that she also
had, next to her side,

00:11:38.408 --> 00:11:42.850
these two absolutely gorgeous
golden snake bracelets,

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:45.303
sort of à la Cleopatra,
Cleopatraesque,

00:11:45.303 --> 00:11:49.080
that she obviously loved and
took with her when she attempted

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.779
to escape from the city.
 

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:54.269
And an even more poignant story
is this one.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:57.090
What we're looking at here is
the head of a woman;

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.090
a young woman,
the excavators have determined.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.875
And if you look at the top of
her head, you will see that a

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:07.288
tuft of hair is actually
preserved.

00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:10.250
It looks dark in this image but
it's actually blond.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.365
So they've been able to
determine this was a young,

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.860
blond woman,
who lived in Herculaneum.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.759
And you can see the small size
of the skeleton below.

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:22.956
This is not hers;
it's obviously her fetus,

00:12:22.956 --> 00:12:23.918
the baby.
 

00:12:23.918 --> 00:12:27.592
She was seven months pregnant
they've been able to determine,

00:12:27.592 --> 00:12:30.960
and so they have found the
bones of the baby as well.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.538
And you can see them here and
the excavators--

00:12:32.538 --> 00:12:35.534
the excavation reports -- they
talk about the fact that the

00:12:35.534 --> 00:12:37.378
bones of the baby,
of the infant,

00:12:37.378 --> 00:12:40.849
of the unborn child,
are so fragile that it was like

00:12:40.849 --> 00:12:45.601
picking up eggshells,
when they were trying to piece

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:48.048
this skeleton together.
 

00:12:48.048 --> 00:12:52.640
So it's incredible the kind of
information that archaeologists

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.404
have been able to glean from
those trying to escape

00:12:56.404 --> 00:13:00.320
Herculaneum on that fateful day
in August of 79.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.344
One other sad story is just
that they did actually find the

00:13:04.344 --> 00:13:07.498
remains of one child--
this is sort of like the story

00:13:07.498 --> 00:13:11.004
of the dog at Pompeii--
one child whose remains were

00:13:11.004 --> 00:13:14.230
left in this little crib in one
house.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.601
And again the bones are
preserved, because of this

00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:21.658
circumstance of the particular
configuration of the lava;

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:26.576
the bones of that small child
are also preserved in this crib

00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:29.690
in one of the houses in
Herculaneum.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:36.080
To turn to the city itself,
I show you now a plan of

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.395
Herculaneum,
or at least the excavated part

00:13:39.395 --> 00:13:42.345
of Herculaneum,
that gives you some sense of

00:13:42.345 --> 00:13:43.490
what is there.
 

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:47.109
And I've already mentioned that
we simply won't see any big

00:13:47.109 --> 00:13:50.105
amphitheater in plan,
or any major forum complex,

00:13:50.105 --> 00:13:51.788
and so on and so forth.
 

00:13:51.788 --> 00:13:55.200
We simply don't have that
evidence in the excavated part.

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:58.370
But what you do see is
comparable to the residential

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.490
area of Pompeii.
 

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.389
You can see a series of major
thoroughfares crossing with one

00:14:03.389 --> 00:14:04.038
another.
 

00:14:04.038 --> 00:14:05.972
We can't be sure,
since we don't have the whole

00:14:05.972 --> 00:14:07.878
city,
which is the main cardo

00:14:07.878 --> 00:14:10.649
and which is the main
decumanus of the city,

00:14:10.649 --> 00:14:13.889
but they are certainly laid out
at a quite regular pattern,

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:18.710
with shops and houses
interspersed with one another,

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:24.440
as you can see extremely well
here.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.339
Again, we don't,
as far as we know,

00:14:26.339 --> 00:14:29.577
we really don't--well we're
quite sure we don't have any of

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:31.308
the major public buildings.
 

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:35.067
But there are a couple of
structures here and there that

00:14:35.067 --> 00:14:36.639
do tell us something.
 

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.028
Here's an arch,
for example,

00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:41.115
that may have been on one of
the more important thoroughfares

00:14:41.115 --> 00:14:45.090
of the city,
and we certainly have shops and

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.490
the like along the way.
 

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:52.927
And I can actually show you a
few views of shops and the city

00:14:52.927 --> 00:14:56.802
streets and so on,
that give you a good sense that

00:14:56.802 --> 00:14:59.918
Herculaneum was very similar
looking to Pompeii.

00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:03.302
If you look at the street
here--it's a street from the

00:15:03.302 --> 00:15:07.323
city of Herculaneum--you can see
the same multi-sided stones for

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.409
the pavement.
 

00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:09.690
You can see the same sidewalks.
 

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.820
You can see the same drains in
Herculaneum.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.019
You can see the same rut marks.
 

00:15:14.019 --> 00:15:16.549
What you don't see--and I
started a post on this

00:15:16.549 --> 00:15:19.350
yesterday--what you don't see
are stepping stones.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.100
There are no persevered
stepping stones in Herculaneum.

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:24.350
There are lots of preserved
stepping stones in Pompeii.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:26.788
And I was mulling this over
yesterday in a way,

00:15:26.788 --> 00:15:29.342
even beyond what I have tended
to in the past about these

00:15:29.342 --> 00:15:31.847
stepping stones,
thinking about could I think of

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:35.019
any other examples in any other
Roman city I've ever been,

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:37.432
including Rome itself,
where there's actually quite a

00:15:37.432 --> 00:15:39.519
bit of preserved pavement here
and there --

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:42.210
out on the Via Appia,
in the Roman Forum,

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.308
and so on and so forth?
 

00:15:43.308 --> 00:15:46.052
And I can't think of a single
other site, off the top of my

00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:47.850
head, where we find stepping
stones.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.820
So I just put that out as a
thought question for all of us,

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.899
to see whether I'm missing
something,

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:56.003
or whether it's conceivable
that Pompeii may have been

00:15:56.003 --> 00:15:59.288
exceptional in this regard,
rather than the norm.

00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:02.687
Here we see amphoras,
these clay amphoras in which

00:16:02.687 --> 00:16:06.570
wine or oil were kept,
so a wine or an oil shop there.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:08.029
And then, of course,
our favorite,

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:10.110
the fast-food stand,
the thermopolium;

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.155
Herculaneum had plenty of
thermopolia,

00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:15.580
very similar to those in
Pompeii.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.168
So you can imagine,
for the most part,

00:16:18.168 --> 00:16:20.340
a quite similar looking city.
 

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:23.062
I mentioned though that the
evidence that we do have is

00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:25.028
mostly for residential
architecture,

00:16:25.028 --> 00:16:28.493
and there are three houses in
particular that I want to focus

00:16:28.493 --> 00:16:30.054
on,
because they give us

00:16:30.054 --> 00:16:33.883
information that goes beyond the
information that I've been able

00:16:33.883 --> 00:16:37.529
to give you from the houses that
we looked at in Pompeii.

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:42.065
The first one I want to look at
is the so-called Samnite House

00:16:42.065 --> 00:16:43.330
at Herculaneum.
 

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:48.202
It dates to the second century
B.C., and you see it in plan

00:16:48.202 --> 00:16:48.789
here.
 

00:16:48.789 --> 00:16:50.350
It's a very simple house.
 

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.279
So second century B.C.
 

00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:52.678
That tells you what?
 

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:55.808
It tells you that it's early,
but it's already in that

00:16:55.808 --> 00:16:59.115
Hellenized-domus period,
which began in the second

00:16:59.115 --> 00:17:00.058
century B.C.
 

00:17:00.058 --> 00:17:03.460
So we look to see which plan it
conforms to.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.685
Does it conform to the Domus
Italica, or the Hellenized

00:17:06.685 --> 00:17:07.480
domus?
 

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:10.220
Well at first it looks like it
conforms to the Domus

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.910
Italica, because you can see
it's quite simple.

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.250
It has the basic core.
 

00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:16.240
You come in here,
into the fauces.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.410
There are cells on either side,
the cellae.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.660
These cellae are indeed cellae.
 

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.308
They open up only to the house
and not to the outside.

00:17:25.308 --> 00:17:27.589
They have not been transformed
into shops.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.358
We see the atrium here.
 

00:17:29.358 --> 00:17:32.404
We see the impluvium of
the atrium, and there was,

00:17:32.404 --> 00:17:34.690
of course, a compluvium
up above.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.693
We see a very small number of
cubicula,

00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:39.430
just a couple over here.
 

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.788
And we don't seem to see the
usual wings,

00:17:42.788 --> 00:17:45.681
unless this one over
here--although there seems to be

00:17:45.681 --> 00:17:47.849
some sort of staircase on that
side--

00:17:47.849 --> 00:17:50.200
served in part as the wing.
 

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.586
And so and one of those rooms,
probably the left one,

00:17:53.586 --> 00:17:55.410
served as the dining room.
 

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.108
There's no hortus,
there's no peristyle.

00:17:57.108 --> 00:18:01.442
So again at first it looks like
a pretty simple example of

00:18:01.442 --> 00:18:05.394
the--an even simplified version
of a typical Domus

00:18:05.394 --> 00:18:06.608
Italica.
 

00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:09.193
But when we walk into the
atrium, which is very well

00:18:09.193 --> 00:18:11.119
preserved today,
we see something quite

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:11.828
different.
 

00:18:11.828 --> 00:18:15.099
The focus in this particular
house was the atrium.

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:16.288
You can tell it's an atrium.
 

00:18:16.288 --> 00:18:18.720
You can see the
compluvium up above.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.700
We're looking here at the
entranceway, through the

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.000
fauces.
 

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.920
These are the doors into the
two cells, one on either side.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:31.882
This is a door into one of the
only two cubicula in this

00:18:31.882 --> 00:18:32.650
structure.
 

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.878
You can see also that the
patron and designer of this

00:18:36.878 --> 00:18:41.058
particular house wanted to--
you can see that this is a

00:18:41.058 --> 00:18:44.376
Hellenized domus,
in the sense that they have

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:48.849
incorporated pilasters here,
on either side of the wall,

00:18:48.849 --> 00:18:51.368
next to the entranceway.
 

00:18:51.368 --> 00:18:56.347
But most interesting of all is
what has happened in what seems

00:18:56.347 --> 00:18:59.450
to be a second story for the
atrium.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.210
They have expanded,
they have moved,

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:04.898
they have developed the atrium
even more vertically than has

00:19:04.898 --> 00:19:12.361
been the case before,
by adding this blind gallery,

00:19:12.361 --> 00:19:17.603
up at the top,
which on three sides is again

00:19:17.603 --> 00:19:19.692
closed--
you can see the enclosed

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:23.256
wall--but on the fourth side,
which I don't have an image to

00:19:23.256 --> 00:19:26.220
show you,
the fourth side, it's open.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.342
So there's an open loggia,
there's open space between the

00:19:29.342 --> 00:19:29.900
columns.
 

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.827
So blind gallery on three
sides, open loggia on the other

00:19:33.827 --> 00:19:35.769
side;
the open loggia,

00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:40.660
of course, bringing additional
light into the atrium.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.568
So a very elaborate treatment
of the atrium,

00:19:43.568 --> 00:19:48.298
which shows us not only the
esteem in which this particular

00:19:48.298 --> 00:19:51.699
patron held the atrium,
but also this interesting

00:19:51.699 --> 00:19:54.666
incorporation of columns in a
different way than we've seen

00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:56.882
before,
making them the high point of

00:19:56.882 --> 00:19:59.559
this room by placing them in the
second story.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:01.150
They are Ionic columns.
 

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.207
Notice also this sort of
latticework fence that encircles

00:20:05.207 --> 00:20:05.568
it.
 

00:20:05.568 --> 00:20:08.518
We'll see that kind of
latticework fence also in Roman

00:20:08.518 --> 00:20:09.130
painting.
 

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.221
You can see,
in fact, the remains of some

00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:12.318
paint on the walls.
 

00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:15.240
So the walls behind this were
painted.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.974
So a very opulent atrium that
shows again this interest in

00:20:19.974 --> 00:20:24.959
building vertically and adding
some interest at the uppermost

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:27.251
part,
to create this sense of two

00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:27.740
stories.
 

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.311
This is a development--this is
in fact even early for that,

00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:34.519
in the second century B.C.
 

00:20:34.519 --> 00:20:40.530
The two most important houses,
however, at Herculaneum are the

00:20:40.530 --> 00:20:46.048
House of the Mosaic Atrium and
the House of the Stags.

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:50.098
And I want to look at both of
those houses with you today.

00:20:50.098 --> 00:20:53.130
I'm going to start with the
House of the Mosaic Atrium.

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.383
You can see from this plan,
which comes from the

00:20:55.383 --> 00:20:57.923
Ward-Perkins textbook,
you can see from this plan that

00:20:57.923 --> 00:21:01.666
they are literally side-by-side;
they essentially share a wall,

00:21:01.666 --> 00:21:03.078
as you can see here.
 

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:07.078
They are very important in
terms of the development,

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:11.972
not only of residential
architecture in Campania in the

00:21:11.972 --> 00:21:16.980
late first century A.D.,
but also as a premonition of

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.009
what's to come in much later
residential architecture.

00:21:22.009 --> 00:21:23.421
Again, I'm going to look at
both of them,

00:21:23.421 --> 00:21:25.078
and we'll start first with the
Mosaic Atrium.

00:21:25.078 --> 00:21:27.150
If you look at the top of the
plan,

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.118
the northern most part of the
plan--

00:21:29.118 --> 00:21:31.317
and this house,
by the way, does--as you can

00:21:31.317 --> 00:21:35.190
see from the Monument List--
does date to A.D.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:40.071
62 to 79, so at the very end of
domestic architecture

00:21:40.071 --> 00:21:42.420
development in Pompeii.
 

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.598
If we look at the uppermost
part, the north,

00:21:44.598 --> 00:21:47.769
you will see that if you enter
the house at the arrow,

00:21:47.769 --> 00:21:51.058
and you look ahead,
you would think--

00:21:51.058 --> 00:21:53.548
you look at the vista ahead and
see the atrium and the

00:21:53.548 --> 00:21:56.195
tablinum--
you would think you were in a

00:21:56.195 --> 00:21:58.680
typical Domus Italica
type house.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.869
It's got those three main
elements.

00:22:00.869 --> 00:22:03.146
It's got the fauces;
it's got the atrium with an

00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:05.277
impluvium and a
compluvium,

00:22:05.277 --> 00:22:08.070
as we'll see;
and it's got a tablinum,

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.950
all on axis with one another.
 

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.960
But as you're standing in the
atrium looking toward the

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.143
tablinum,
you're kind of looking at this

00:22:15.143 --> 00:22:16.680
tablinum and saying to
yourself,

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.558
"This is not the
tablinum I know,

00:22:18.558 --> 00:22:19.798
this is not the tablinum
I'm used to,

00:22:19.798 --> 00:22:22.250
this is not the tablinum
in most of the houses that I

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.788
know."
 

00:22:22.788 --> 00:22:24.910
It's designed in a very
different way.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.238
And what is it that you see in
plan that indicates to us that

00:22:28.238 --> 00:22:30.180
it's designed in a different
way?

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:32.289
Does anyone see what it is?
 

00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:33.960
Student:  Columns.
 

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:37.011
Prof: It has--are they
columns?

00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:38.250
Look closely.
 

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.980
Student:  Flat.
 

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.957
Prof: Are they round?
 

00:22:40.957 --> 00:22:41.690
Student:  No.
 

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:42.710
Prof: No, they're square.
 

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.538
So they're either piers,
or they're columns on bases

00:22:46.538 --> 00:22:47.890
that are square.
 

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.148
But you're right,
there are architectural members

00:22:50.148 --> 00:22:50.618
in here.
 

00:22:50.618 --> 00:22:53.289
It turns out they're piers
but--so there are piers in here.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:54.230
Okay.
 

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:55.170
What else?
 

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:58.358
What about the actual plan
itself?

00:22:58.358 --> 00:23:04.297
How are those piers--what's the
relationship of those piers to

00:23:04.297 --> 00:23:06.049
the room design?
 

00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:09.569
Someone over there?
 

00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:12.559
Student:  Freestanding.
 

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.140
Prof: Freestanding. Yes.
 

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.710
What else?
 

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:18.528
Does it remind you of a plan
we've seen in another context?

00:23:18.528 --> 00:23:22.924
You're looking at a central
space, divided by two aisles,

00:23:22.924 --> 00:23:26.849
by architectural members,
in this case by piers.

00:23:26.849 --> 00:23:27.848
A basilica.
 

00:23:27.848 --> 00:23:31.336
It's a basilican plan:
central nave,

00:23:31.336 --> 00:23:33.130
two side aisles.
 

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.430
What's a basilican plan doing
in a house?

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:37.220
Is this a basilica or a law
court?

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.779
No.
 

00:23:37.779 --> 00:23:40.530
It's actually a winter
banqueting room,

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:44.730
but a winter banqueting room in
the shape of a basilica.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.306
And I make a lot of that,
because we'll see this

00:23:47.306 --> 00:23:50.650
happening with increasing
frequency in Roman architecture,

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.397
and that is a certain building
type that was developed for one

00:23:53.397 --> 00:23:56.314
kind of building--
in this case a basilican plan

00:23:56.314 --> 00:24:00.622
developed for law courts--
begins to be used for another

00:24:00.622 --> 00:24:03.438
kind of room,
in this case a winter

00:24:03.438 --> 00:24:04.700
banqueting hall.
 

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.601
And I like to call this the
sort of inter-changeability of

00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:09.619
form --
that you can develop a certain

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:11.650
plan for a certain kind of
structure,

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:14.963
but then be creative enough to
realize that you could use that

00:24:14.963 --> 00:24:16.920
same plan in another
environment,

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.098
in a different but interesting
way.

00:24:19.098 --> 00:24:20.920
And that's exactly what happens
here.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.200
Now needless to say the scale
is actually fairly large.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.430
But this does not look like a
huge basilica.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:30.890
It's brought down to domestic
size scale, as you can see here.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.750
So that's a very interesting
development.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.262
It's very well preserved,
and I'll show it to you in a

00:24:35.262 --> 00:24:35.690
moment.
 

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.845
So once you get into the
atrium, then you have to take an

00:24:38.845 --> 00:24:41.720
abrupt right in order to see the
peristyle court.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.868
And the peristyle court is
very, very large.

00:24:43.868 --> 00:24:47.425
We've talked about the fact
that there was an increasing

00:24:47.425 --> 00:24:51.630
interest in the peristyle as a
key component of a Roman house,

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:53.868
and we see that very clearly
here;

00:24:53.868 --> 00:24:57.163
in fact, the peristyle is
really beginning to take pride

00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:59.078
of place away from the atrium.
 

00:24:59.078 --> 00:25:02.622
Because the atrium is almost
beginning to go the way of the

00:25:02.622 --> 00:25:05.492
tablinum,
in the sense that it's becoming

00:25:05.492 --> 00:25:08.240
a kind of passageway;
it's not an end in itself,

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.009
it's becoming--or the atrium
and tablinum aren't ends

00:25:11.009 --> 00:25:13.121
in themselves,
they are a passageway into this

00:25:13.121 --> 00:25:14.058
huge peristyle.
 

00:25:14.058 --> 00:25:16.910
If you look at the plan of the
peristyle, you can see that

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.259
there are columns,
but those columns are engaged

00:25:19.259 --> 00:25:20.160
into the wall.
 

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:21.099
And that's well preserved.
 

00:25:21.099 --> 00:25:22.269
I'll show it to you in a moment.
 

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:26.679
And then also extremely
interesting is now on axis with

00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:30.190
the atrium and the huge
peristyle, is TR;

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.798
TR is the triclinium or
the dining room.

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:35.940
And look at the size of that
triclinium,

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:39.161
and look at the fact that the
triclinium opens both off

00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:41.960
the peristyle and also has an
opening on this way,

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.545
on this end,
toward the front--toward the

00:25:44.545 --> 00:25:47.818
other side,
excuse me--of the house.

00:25:47.818 --> 00:25:52.861
And this is the side,
the southern side that faces

00:25:52.861 --> 00:25:53.890
the sea.
 

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.499
And Herculaneum was very
close--I'll show you a restored

00:25:57.499 --> 00:26:01.371
view that makes this clear in a
moment--Herculaneum was very

00:26:01.371 --> 00:26:02.750
close to the sea.
 

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.924
And these two houses were
probably among the two most

00:26:05.924 --> 00:26:09.772
expensive houses in Herculaneum,
because they had the best views

00:26:09.772 --> 00:26:10.690
of the sea.
 

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.752
They were very high up,
above the sea wall,

00:26:12.752 --> 00:26:14.670
and they looked right out at
the sea.

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.028
So the way they've designed
this: very large

00:26:17.028 --> 00:26:20.016
triclinium,
to benefit from being able to

00:26:20.016 --> 00:26:23.309
see both the peristyle and views
out over the sea,

00:26:23.309 --> 00:26:24.750
even while you were dining.
 

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:29.461
There seems to have been a
colonnade over here--so views

00:26:29.461 --> 00:26:33.402
through columns,
out to the sea--and then these

00:26:33.402 --> 00:26:35.029
two rooms at D.
 

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:37.950
These are, as you can see here,
the diaetae;

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:44.308
d-i-a-e-t-a, singular;
d-i-a-e-t-a-e, plural.

00:26:44.308 --> 00:26:48.171
These are rooms that are set
aside for sort of summer

00:26:48.171 --> 00:26:52.403
pleasure, summer pleasures,
near the panoramic window that

00:26:52.403 --> 00:26:54.779
you can look out to the sea.
 

00:26:54.779 --> 00:26:58.471
So a place to relax and enjoy
the sunshine on the southern

00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.838
end;
views of the sea;

00:26:59.838 --> 00:27:04.105
a special room set aside just
for that kind of panoramic

00:27:04.105 --> 00:27:05.890
viewing and the like.
 

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:08.604
So this move again toward
vista, toward panorama,

00:27:08.604 --> 00:27:10.808
that we've been talking about
before.

00:27:10.808 --> 00:27:15.492
So some very important changes
here that signal where Roman

00:27:15.492 --> 00:27:19.450
residential architecture will go
in the future.

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:23.189
I'm going to wait on the plan
of the Stags until we finish

00:27:23.189 --> 00:27:24.828
with the Mosaic Atrium.
 

00:27:24.828 --> 00:27:27.551
The Mosaic Atrium,
you can see a view into the

00:27:27.551 --> 00:27:28.460
atrium today.
 

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.976
You can see why the house is
called the House of the Mosaic

00:27:30.976 --> 00:27:32.612
Atrium,
because of the very

00:27:32.612 --> 00:27:37.471
well-preserved black and white,
striking black and white mosaic

00:27:37.471 --> 00:27:39.259
that we find there.
 

00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:42.384
And you can see how well
preserved the impluvium

00:27:42.384 --> 00:27:44.990
is, with the mosaic decoration
around that.

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.362
You can also see,
however, if you look carefully

00:27:47.362 --> 00:27:50.289
at this image--you've probably
noticed it already--that the

00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:51.299
floor undulates.
 

00:27:51.299 --> 00:27:52.500
Why does the floor undulate?
 

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:57.029
The floor undulates because of
that heavy blanket of lava that

00:27:57.029 --> 00:28:02.231
entered into Herculaneum,
that made its presence known

00:28:02.231 --> 00:28:08.700
and that distorted the shape of
the floor of the atrium,

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.359
but fortunately preserved it,
at the same time,

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:12.538
which is great.
 

00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:15.500
We're looking from the atrium
into the tablinum,

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.901
and we see that basilican form
that we described already

00:28:18.901 --> 00:28:21.470
before: a central nave,
a back wall,

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:24.278
side aisles on either--
you can't see this side,

00:28:24.278 --> 00:28:25.910
but the same on this side as on
this side--

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:31.098
side aisles and circulation of
space among them.

00:28:31.098 --> 00:28:34.259
And you can also see,
if you look very carefully--

00:28:34.259 --> 00:28:35.750
and I have another view in a
moment--

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.910
that there are windows here as
well,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.048
windows that allow light into
the system.

00:28:40.048 --> 00:28:42.279
When we talked about the
Basilica of Pompeii,

00:28:42.279 --> 00:28:46.008
I mentioned to you that the
Basilica at Pompeii did not have

00:28:46.008 --> 00:28:49.433
a clerestory--
c-l-e-r-e s-t-o-r-y--did not

00:28:49.433 --> 00:28:52.781
have a clerestory,
but that we would begin to see

00:28:52.781 --> 00:28:55.000
the development of the
clerestory later.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.751
We see it here;
this use of a clerestory with

00:28:57.751 --> 00:29:01.709
the placement of windows in that
second story to allow light into

00:29:01.709 --> 00:29:02.759
the structure.
 

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:04.338
It has been developed here.
 

00:29:04.338 --> 00:29:07.066
It's a very important
architectural development,

00:29:07.066 --> 00:29:10.430
and we're going to see again
the ramifications of that into

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.298
the future.
 

00:29:11.298 --> 00:29:16.480
Here's another view of this
banqueting hall.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.838
And, by the way,
the technical name for this--

00:29:18.838 --> 00:29:19.690
and I have it on the Monument
List for you--

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.832
is the Egyptian oecus or
the oecus

00:29:22.832 --> 00:29:24.805
Aegypticus;
the oecus

00:29:24.805 --> 00:29:27.289
Aegyptiacus,
or if it's easier for you,

00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:30.400
the Egyptian oecus:
this particular form of

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:34.058
banqueting hall,
in the shape of a basilica.

00:29:34.058 --> 00:29:36.779
This view is helpful,
not only because you can see

00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:39.486
the piers better,
but also because you can see

00:29:39.486 --> 00:29:42.051
the windows better:
the clerestory system that

00:29:42.051 --> 00:29:43.818
allows light into the space.
 

00:29:43.818 --> 00:29:47.066
And you can also see this
ubiquitous use of white and red

00:29:47.066 --> 00:29:50.311
for the piers in this case,
just as they are usually used

00:29:50.311 --> 00:29:51.240
for columns.
 

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:55.056
The uppermost part of the pier
is white, and then they've

00:29:55.056 --> 00:29:56.759
painted the bottom red.
 

00:29:56.759 --> 00:30:02.460
So very similarly to the kind
of decor we saw also in Pompeii.

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.880
This is, of course,
the peristyle court.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.145
You can see it here,
and you can see the way in

00:30:09.145 --> 00:30:14.432
which these columns have been
engaged into the wall of the

00:30:14.432 --> 00:30:16.009
garden court.
 

00:30:16.009 --> 00:30:19.009
You can also see this
interesting use of combination

00:30:19.009 --> 00:30:21.480
of stone and tile,
for the construction.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.875
Also interesting,
as you look at the rooms that

00:30:24.875 --> 00:30:29.377
line the side of the peristyle,
you can see how opened up they

00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:30.558
have become.
 

00:30:30.558 --> 00:30:34.388
We don't see that severe wall
that we saw in the very earliest

00:30:34.388 --> 00:30:36.711
Domus Italica,
with no windows,

00:30:36.711 --> 00:30:38.029
as you'll recall.
 

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:40.769
There are lots of windows here,
and they are large windows,

00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:43.910
and they are allowing light
into the structure,

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.568
not just on the front,
where the views are,

00:30:45.568 --> 00:30:47.538
but on the other sides of the
building.

00:30:47.538 --> 00:30:51.880
This is again a very important
change and one that is going to

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.578
have again important
ramifications for the future.

00:30:55.578 --> 00:31:00.923
Note also that the famous
Pompeian red is used to decorate

00:31:00.923 --> 00:31:02.048
the walls.
 

00:31:02.048 --> 00:31:04.108
So that's the House of the
Mosaic Atrium.

00:31:04.108 --> 00:31:07.759
Now let's turn to the House of
the Stags;

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:10.410
the House of the Stags so
called because of a sculpture

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:13.108
that was found there,
that I'll show you a bit later.

00:31:13.108 --> 00:31:16.616
If we look at the House of the
Stags, we see some interesting

00:31:16.616 --> 00:31:19.540
things happening as well,
that seem to parallel the

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.880
development we've already
described.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.818
This house too,
built between 62 and 79.

00:31:24.818 --> 00:31:29.098
The entrance in this case is on
the uppermost right,

00:31:29.098 --> 00:31:33.056
right here, and you can see
that you enter in along a

00:31:33.056 --> 00:31:36.753
fauces,
along the throat of the house,

00:31:36.753 --> 00:31:39.880
into what is designated as the
atrium.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:43.803
But that atrium is not like any
other atrium we've seen thus far

00:31:43.803 --> 00:31:44.799
this semester.
 

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:47.000
What's missing?
 

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.900
Student: 
Impluvium.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.968
Prof: The
impluvium;

00:31:48.968 --> 00:31:50.068
the impluvium is
missing.

00:31:50.068 --> 00:31:54.252
If there's no impluvium,
there's no compluvium,

00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:57.808
which means that the room is
not open to the sky.

00:31:57.808 --> 00:32:01.592
And we call an atrium that has
no opening--and I've put this on

00:32:01.592 --> 00:32:04.154
the Monument List for you--an
atrium

00:32:04.154 --> 00:32:06.755
testudinatum;
an atrium

00:32:06.755 --> 00:32:11.369
testudinatum is an atrium
that has no opening to the sky.

00:32:11.369 --> 00:32:12.720
And that's the case here.
 

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.250
That also tends to underplay
the space,

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:20.249
because it's no longer as
interesting as it was when it

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:23.970
had that wonderful basin and the
skylight and so on and so forth.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:25.843
And if you look at the plan,
you'll see it's very

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:26.390
interesting.
 

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.470
It has lots of openings on
various sides.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.471
So this is a really good
example of what I was hinting at

00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:34.686
before, and that is the atrium
beginning to go the way of the

00:32:34.686 --> 00:32:37.222
tablinum;
the atrium beginning to become

00:32:37.222 --> 00:32:39.759
a passageway from one part of
the house to another.

00:32:39.759 --> 00:32:42.788
It really is merely a
passageway from the outside,

00:32:42.788 --> 00:32:45.881
from the fauces,
into the other rooms of the

00:32:45.881 --> 00:32:46.500
house.
 

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:49.368
What has received the greatest
emphasis,

00:32:49.368 --> 00:32:53.019
by the patron and by the
designer, is not the atrium,

00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:56.098
but is the triclinium or
dining hall,

00:32:56.098 --> 00:32:57.970
and you can see that there are
two of them,

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:02.920
and they are placed in
relationship to one another,

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.900
axial relationship to one
another.

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.788
So they're almost talking to
one another;

00:33:06.788 --> 00:33:09.390
there's a kind of dialogue,
an architectural dialogue,

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:12.117
between that smaller
triclinium and this

00:33:12.117 --> 00:33:16.588
larger triclinium,
across an open courtyard.

00:33:16.588 --> 00:33:20.694
So here we see again the
triclinium beginning to

00:33:20.694 --> 00:33:25.028
emerge as the single most
important room in the house,

00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:28.490
which obviously signals what's
going on in these houses --

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.480
that people are beginning to
use them even more than they did

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.204
before,
not only as places of business

00:33:34.204 --> 00:33:37.838
but as places to enjoy fabulous
dinner parties,

00:33:37.838 --> 00:33:40.380
while you can look out over the
sea.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.267
And, in fact,
if you look at this

00:33:41.267 --> 00:33:42.698
triclinium,
the larger one,

00:33:42.698 --> 00:33:45.808
you can see again it opens both
off the garden court,

00:33:45.808 --> 00:33:49.707
and also opens toward the
south, where you would have seen

00:33:49.707 --> 00:33:52.450
the views of the sea;
all of this very deliberate.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:55.982
We see the diaetae here
as well, these summer living

00:33:55.982 --> 00:33:58.358
spaces with views out over the
water.

00:33:58.358 --> 00:34:03.000
And here we see an interesting
detail,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.972
which is a kind of kiosk or
gazebo that's located in the

00:34:05.972 --> 00:34:07.846
front,
and that actually still

00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:10.800
survives, and I'll show that to
you in a moment.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.239
So again quite momentous
changes in residential

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:21.032
architecture in Herculaneum and
in Campania in general in the

00:34:21.032 --> 00:34:23.639
late first century A.D.
 

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.523
This is a restored view -- very
helpful because we can use it to

00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:27.989
illustrate a number of things.
 

00:34:27.989 --> 00:34:31.719
We can use it to illustrate how
close to the sea Herculaneum

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:32.099
was.
 

00:34:32.099 --> 00:34:35.657
We can use it to look at the
sea wall that I talked about

00:34:35.657 --> 00:34:36.230
before.
 

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:40.054
We can use it to look at the
harbor, the small boat dock that

00:34:40.054 --> 00:34:42.349
was down here,
with boats waiting.

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:47.097
This was the place that people
ran to in order to escape the

00:34:47.097 --> 00:34:49.349
onslaught of the Vesuvius.
 

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:53.900
And this is exactly -- this sea
wall is exactly where those

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.509
bodies were found,
so they made it this far but

00:34:57.509 --> 00:34:59.000
not far enough.
 

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.916
And we can pick out both the
House of the Mosaic Atrium,

00:35:01.916 --> 00:35:04.516
right here, and the House of
the Stags, over here:

00:35:04.516 --> 00:35:06.849
both of them very large,
as you can see.

00:35:06.849 --> 00:35:09.360
You can see in the case--here's
the northern end--

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.112
you can see is this case,
for the House of the Mosaic

00:35:11.112 --> 00:35:13.119
Atrium,
the compluvium of the

00:35:13.119 --> 00:35:15.849
atrium that we described,
the mosaic atrium.

00:35:15.849 --> 00:35:18.018
You can see the open court here.
 

00:35:18.018 --> 00:35:22.809
You can see the side that faces
the sea and how opened up it is,

00:35:22.809 --> 00:35:26.550
how many windows there were,
how open,

00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:28.702
the diaetae on either
side, where you could get nice

00:35:28.702 --> 00:35:29.000
views.
 

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.889
Here, the House of the Stags,
same sort of thing.

00:35:31.889 --> 00:35:34.518
You see no opening whatsoever
in the northern end,

00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:37.199
no opening in the ceiling,
no compluvium.

00:35:37.199 --> 00:35:40.306
You see the two
trinclinia facing one

00:35:40.306 --> 00:35:44.659
another across the open court,
and you see that little gazebo

00:35:44.659 --> 00:35:47.211
entranceway,
a gazebo that again looks out

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:50.440
toward the sea,
that distinctive detail.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.800
Here are a couple more views,
just to show you quickly.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.927
If you go and visit
Herculaneum, you can still see

00:35:55.927 --> 00:35:59.309
those sea walls there,
made out of concrete as you can

00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.820
see.
 

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.960
They're well worth taking a
look at.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.865
And this is a view taken--this
is one of the ways you can enter

00:36:06.865 --> 00:36:09.239
into the city--taken across.
 

00:36:09.239 --> 00:36:13.052
You can see Vesuvius in the
background, and you can see this

00:36:13.052 --> 00:36:16.737
is the House of the Mosaic
Atrium, that we've been looking

00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:17.190
at.
 

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.429
This is the House of the Stags.
 

00:36:18.429 --> 00:36:21.257
And you can tell the difference
because of the little gazebo,

00:36:21.257 --> 00:36:22.389
little kiosk in front.
 

00:36:22.389 --> 00:36:26.740
And here you can see again so
well the way this is positioned

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:30.809
high up on the wall,
with spectacular views of the

00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:35.940
sea, and this opening up of the
wall to allow maximum vista,

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:40.990
maximum panorama,
through those spaces in the

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:41.909
house.
 

00:36:41.909 --> 00:36:44.246
Note the kiosk here,
and then note this other

00:36:44.246 --> 00:36:46.128
entrance;
I'm going to show you both of

00:36:46.128 --> 00:36:46.889
those in detail.
 

00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:47.940
This is a little gazebo.
 

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.099
As you can see,
it rests on piers.

00:36:50.099 --> 00:36:52.969
It was obviously a very
pleasant place to sit,

00:36:52.969 --> 00:36:56.347
with marble furniture,
and to have a glass of wine out

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:58.579
here, looking out over the sea.
 

00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:02.112
And you can see once again that
the piers have been stuccoed

00:37:02.112 --> 00:37:04.387
over: white on top,
red on the bottom,

00:37:04.387 --> 00:37:07.530
just as we have seen is so
characteristic also of Pompeii.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:11.320
And right behind,
that other entranceway,

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.260
that I can also show you,
where you can see--

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.889
if you look very closely,
you can see not only the red

00:37:16.889 --> 00:37:20.483
paint on the pilasters,
but also the very elaborate

00:37:20.483 --> 00:37:24.920
decoration in blue and white of
the pediment above.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.956
This gives you some sense also
of the kind of decorative

00:37:27.956 --> 00:37:30.829
sculpture there would've been in
buildings like this:

00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:34.711
the marble tables,
these wonderful statues--there

00:37:34.711 --> 00:37:38.347
are two of them--
of stags being attacked by

00:37:38.347 --> 00:37:43.599
hounds, and these stags are what
have given this house its name,

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:47.889
the House of the Stags.
 

00:37:47.889 --> 00:37:51.762
I want to turn from Roman
residential architecture in

00:37:51.762 --> 00:37:54.889
Herculaneum and the developments
there,

00:37:54.889 --> 00:38:00.530
to early Roman wall decoration,
painted decoration,

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:04.148
and as I said at the beginning,
specifically to the First and

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:06.559
Second Styles of Roman wall
painting,

00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:09.239
which are particularly
interesting in the context of a

00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:11.672
course on architecture because,
as we'll see,

00:38:11.672 --> 00:38:13.760
they are so architecturally
oriented.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:18.472
I want to begin with a wall
from the House of Sallust,

00:38:18.472 --> 00:38:21.230
and we'll go back to Pompeii.
 

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:24.315
We'll be looking at examples
both in Pompeii and Herculaneum,

00:38:24.315 --> 00:38:25.139
and also Rome.
 

00:38:25.139 --> 00:38:28.340
I want to look at the House of
Sallust in Pompeii.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.032
And you can see from your
Monument List that the

00:38:31.032 --> 00:38:34.355
tablinum was decorated
with what we call First Style

00:38:34.355 --> 00:38:35.730
Roman wall painting.
 

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:39.329
That's obviously a modern,
scholarly designation.

00:38:39.329 --> 00:38:42.793
They didn't call it that in
ancient Rome or Pompeii or

00:38:42.793 --> 00:38:43.710
Herculaneum.
 

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.250
First Style Roman wall painting.
 

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:50.445
This tablinum in this
house was decorated in around

00:38:50.445 --> 00:38:54.860
100 B.C., which is when we date
most of the examples of First

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.070
Style Roman wall painting.
 

00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.407
It is very well preserved,
and it gives us a very good

00:39:00.407 --> 00:39:03.367
sense of what the Romans,
or what, in this case,

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:05.949
the Pompeians were trying to
achieve.

00:39:05.949 --> 00:39:09.079
This style, the First Style of
Roman wall painting is also--

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:12.105
you'll see it referred to in
your books and in your textbooks

00:39:12.105 --> 00:39:16.570
and in scholarship in general,
as either the Masonry Style,

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.268
or the Incrustation Style.
 

00:39:19.268 --> 00:39:22.670
And the reason for this--both
of those are good descriptions--

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:26.490
because you can see that what
is at work here is that the

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:29.289
designers are trying to create a
wall,

00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:32.172
they're trying to create the
illusion that what we're looking

00:39:32.172 --> 00:39:33.949
at is not a stucco and paint
wall,

00:39:33.949 --> 00:39:35.269
which is actually what it's
made out of,

00:39:35.269 --> 00:39:37.300
but a real marble wall.
 

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:41.480
We can see that the wall is
divided into a series of zones,

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.472
architectural zones,
which are exactly the zones

00:39:44.472 --> 00:39:47.340
that were used in Roman building
technique.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.070
We don't quite see it here.
 

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.429
I'll show it to you in another
example.

00:39:50.429 --> 00:39:52.733
There's usually,
way at the bottom,

00:39:52.733 --> 00:39:55.715
a very narrow band,
which is called a plinth,

00:39:55.715 --> 00:39:56.800
p-l-i-n-t-h.
 

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:01.422
The plinth has above it what's
called a socle,

00:40:01.422 --> 00:40:07.380
s-o-c-l-e, which is a higher,
a slightly higher element.

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:13.650
Then what are called the
orthostats, o-r-t-h-o-s-t-a-t-s;

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.000
the orthostats are these blocks
here.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.465
And then the isodomic,
i-s-o-d-o-m-i-c,

00:40:21.465 --> 00:40:25.980
the isodomic courses;
you see those here.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.099
And then usually either a
stringcourse,

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:31.478
or more likely,
or in addition to,

00:40:31.478 --> 00:40:33.891
a cornice,
what's called a cornice,

00:40:33.891 --> 00:40:38.190
a projecting cornice--
c-o-r-n-i-c-e--at the top.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:42.097
So plinth, socle,
orthostats, isodomic blocks,

00:40:42.097 --> 00:40:46.699
and then the stringcourse and
the cornice, which again

00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:51.130
corresponds to actual Roman
building technique.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:54.956
But more important than that
terminology is again what they

00:40:54.956 --> 00:40:56.869
are trying to achieve here.
 

00:40:56.869 --> 00:41:00.597
It is clear when you look--well
first of all keep in mind that

00:41:00.597 --> 00:41:02.681
this is not flat;
it's a relief,

00:41:02.681 --> 00:41:05.905
it's a relief wall,
and the wall has been built up

00:41:05.905 --> 00:41:07.750
in relief through stucco.
 

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:10.260
They've taken the rubble wall,
they've added stucco,

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.059
and they've made that stucco
look like a series of blocks

00:41:13.059 --> 00:41:15.159
that are divided by these
stringcourses.

00:41:15.159 --> 00:41:17.768
Then what they've done is
painted those blocks,

00:41:17.768 --> 00:41:20.320
and they've painted those
blocks not all one color,

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.429
not all Pompeian red,
but all different kinds of

00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:26.340
colors: green and red and pink
and beige,

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.679
and sometimes multicolored,
as we'll see.

00:41:28.679 --> 00:41:30.349
What is the implication here?
 

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:33.510
The implication here is that we
are looking--

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:35.030
that they're trying to create
the illusion,

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.159
through stucco and paint,
of a marble wall,

00:41:39.159 --> 00:41:42.018
of a marble wall that would've
been very expensive to build,

00:41:42.018 --> 00:41:44.440
because you would've had to
bring all of these multicolored

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.981
marbles,
which you could not find in

00:41:46.981 --> 00:41:51.454
Italy, from places very far
away: from North Africa or from

00:41:51.454 --> 00:41:54.768
Asia Minor or from Greece or
from Egypt.

00:41:54.768 --> 00:41:57.384
You'd have to bring it from
very, very, very far away,

00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:59.900
and that would cost a
tremendous amount of money.

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.721
So what they are saying here
is, "I'm the owner of this

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:04.239
house.
 

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:08.132
I am wealthy enough to be able
to afford bringing marble from

00:42:08.132 --> 00:42:11.052
all over the world and using it
to decorate my

00:42:11.052 --> 00:42:12.739
tablinum."
 

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:16.228
Now was anyone fooled that this
was a real marble wall and not a

00:42:16.228 --> 00:42:17.059
painted wall?
 

00:42:17.059 --> 00:42:18.170
Well probably not.
 

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.918
But the idea was to give one
the sense that this was a very

00:42:22.918 --> 00:42:24.309
expensive wall.
 

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:27.956
And we'll see one of the
most--well I'll hold that until

00:42:27.956 --> 00:42:30.210
later, that thought until later.
 

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.599
Here's another example in the
same house.

00:42:32.599 --> 00:42:34.300
This is the House of Sallust.
 

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.563
We are looking--we have
just--here's the tablinum

00:42:36.563 --> 00:42:37.800
wall that we just looked at.
 

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.518
We are now in the atrium of the
house, or what survives of the

00:42:42.518 --> 00:42:44.219
atrium of the house.
 

00:42:44.219 --> 00:42:47.257
We are looking at two of the
cubicula that open off

00:42:47.257 --> 00:42:47.949
the atrium.
 

00:42:47.949 --> 00:42:50.838
And if you look at the walls,
you can see again the same

00:42:50.838 --> 00:42:53.989
effect, that the rubble wall has
been covered with stucco;

00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:56.675
that the stucco has been
divided--the stucco has been

00:42:56.675 --> 00:42:59.030
built up in relief;
that it has been divided into a

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:00.300
series of architectural zones.
 

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:04.213
And then the individual blocks,
in the orthostat level and in

00:43:04.213 --> 00:43:07.344
the isodomic level,
have been painted different

00:43:07.344 --> 00:43:09.722
colors,
again to give this illusion

00:43:09.722 --> 00:43:12.880
that what we are looking at is a
marble wall,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.420
not a painted wall.
 

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.041
So an attempt to make
something, to fictionalize and

00:43:18.041 --> 00:43:21.380
make something seem more than it
actually is.

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.447
Here's another view,
a restored view,

00:43:23.447 --> 00:43:26.893
that gives you a sense perhaps
of what this might have looked

00:43:26.893 --> 00:43:29.250
like when the colors were more
vivid.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.188
We do believe that those
cubicula had doors,

00:43:32.188 --> 00:43:34.949
probably wooden doors that no
longer survive.

00:43:34.949 --> 00:43:37.873
And you can see not only the
architectural courses here,

00:43:37.873 --> 00:43:40.000
but the effect that this
would've had.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.389
Here's one of these
multicolored blocks,

00:43:41.389 --> 00:43:45.503
again, marble that would've had
to be brought from North Africa

00:43:45.503 --> 00:43:48.503
or somewhere like that,
where they had these kinds of

00:43:48.503 --> 00:43:49.469
multicolored marbles.
 

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:52.253
But this gives you some sense
of what the appearance would

00:43:52.253 --> 00:43:52.840
have been.
 

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.335
And perhaps from a distance
your eye really would have been

00:43:56.335 --> 00:43:59.710
fooled into thinking that this
was a real marble wall.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.641
You'll remember the restored
view I showed you of the House

00:44:02.641 --> 00:44:05.237
of the Faun,
where we stood again in the

00:44:05.237 --> 00:44:07.548
atrium,
looking back at the statuette

00:44:07.548 --> 00:44:09.942
of the Faun,
and I mentioned that the walls

00:44:09.942 --> 00:44:12.719
were decorated with First Style
Roman wall painting.

00:44:12.719 --> 00:44:14.429
And so we see that again here.
 

00:44:14.429 --> 00:44:18.014
And we see the kind of effect
it would've had if the entire

00:44:18.014 --> 00:44:21.230
space was covered with this kind
of wall painting.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.371
You can also see the
relationship between those

00:44:24.371 --> 00:44:28.742
paintings and the vista that one
saw as one stood and looked back

00:44:28.742 --> 00:44:32.840
through the columns,
on to the additional columns of

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.460
the peristyle court.
 

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:37.550
Another example of a First
Style wall,

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:42.360
this one from Herculaneum,
is the so-called Samnite House,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.079
which we saw earlier today,
with that fabulous atrium.

00:44:46.079 --> 00:44:47.768
The Samnite House.
 

00:44:47.768 --> 00:44:52.059
And this is the fauces
of the Samnite House;

00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:54.789
also dates to 100 B.C.
 

00:44:54.789 --> 00:44:57.500
And you can see the same scheme
as we already saw.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.193
One additional feature that you
can see better here is the

00:45:01.193 --> 00:45:04.757
plinth, this very narrow band
that we see at the bottom,

00:45:04.757 --> 00:45:05.730
the plinth.
 

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.019
The socle here.
 

00:45:07.019 --> 00:45:09.500
The orthostats here.
 

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.659
The isodomic courses here.
 

00:45:12.659 --> 00:45:14.909
The stringcourse,
and then the cornice.

00:45:14.909 --> 00:45:19.012
So exactly the same scheme that
we saw in the other house at

00:45:19.012 --> 00:45:22.835
Pompeii we see here in the
Samnite House at Herculaneum,

00:45:22.835 --> 00:45:25.268
this one even better preserved.
 

00:45:25.268 --> 00:45:27.429
And that's actually a very
washed out view,

00:45:27.429 --> 00:45:30.492
but I can show you a better
one, where you can get a better

00:45:30.492 --> 00:45:32.974
sense of the coloration of this
particular wall:

00:45:32.974 --> 00:45:36.590
the plinth,
the socle, the orthostats,

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.110
the isodomics and then a
frieze;

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.132
as you can see,
in between the stringcourse and

00:45:42.132 --> 00:45:43.760
the cornice, there is a red
frieze.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.800
And look at--this is better
preserved so that you can get a

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.737
better sense again of what this
might have looked like in

00:45:49.737 --> 00:45:52.936
ancient Roman times--
this wonderful contrast between

00:45:52.936 --> 00:45:55.059
the reddish,
porphyry-like stone that

00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:56.909
probably would've come from
Egypt;

00:45:56.909 --> 00:46:00.768
the multi-grained stone that
might've come from North Africa;

00:46:00.768 --> 00:46:03.050
the kind of impact that this
would've had.

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.041
But again, most important for
us, is what they're trying to do

00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:07.219
is create an illusion.
 

00:46:07.219 --> 00:46:09.974
They're trying to create,
make something look like

00:46:09.974 --> 00:46:11.550
something it really isn't.
 

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:16.489
They are using again stucco and
paint to make a wall,

00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:20.251
to make a very plain wall,
to make a rubble and stucco and

00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:23.090
painted wall into a very
grandiose wall,

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.858
that looked like walls that
were probably the kinds of

00:46:25.858 --> 00:46:27.335
walls--
in fact we're sure they were

00:46:27.335 --> 00:46:30.085
the kinds of walls--
that decorated the palaces of

00:46:30.085 --> 00:46:33.460
great Hellenistic kings in the
Hellenistic East.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:37.454
We know that the great kings of
Pergamon, and some of the other

00:46:37.454 --> 00:46:40.739
kingdoms, had palaces that had
real marble walls.

00:46:40.739 --> 00:46:44.119
And we think it's very likely
that that is the sort of thing

00:46:44.119 --> 00:46:46.409
that they are trying to recreate
here.

00:46:46.409 --> 00:46:48.900
And then a very,
a particularly important point,

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:52.465
I think, is the fact that even
though I would love to lay claim

00:46:52.465 --> 00:46:54.940
to this particular style for the
Romans,

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:57.980
the Romans did not invent the
First Style of Roman wall

00:46:57.980 --> 00:46:58.599
painting.
 

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:00.889
They copied it from the Greeks.
 

00:47:00.889 --> 00:47:04.143
We know that the Greeks used
this First Style of Roman wall

00:47:04.143 --> 00:47:07.172
paint -- it wasn't called the
First Style of Roman wall

00:47:07.172 --> 00:47:09.079
painting, obviously,
for them.

00:47:09.079 --> 00:47:12.271
But they used something
comparable to the First Style,

00:47:12.271 --> 00:47:15.826
which we believe was derived
from these Hellenistic palaces,

00:47:15.826 --> 00:47:16.730
ultimately.
 

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:20.949
And you can see here a view of
a wall,

00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:24.389
or a drawing of a wall,
that was in--

00:47:24.389 --> 00:47:27.643
and it's on your Monument List
-- from the House of the Trident

00:47:27.643 --> 00:47:29.690
on the Island of Delos:
late second,

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:31.579
early first century B.C.
 

00:47:31.579 --> 00:47:38.246
The Island of Delos was
strategically located between

00:47:38.246 --> 00:47:43.889
Italy and Greece and Asia Minor
and so on.

00:47:43.889 --> 00:47:48.641
It was one of these crossroads
of trade, and it was a place

00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:52.490
where Romans settled in the
first centuries B.C.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:53.719
especially.
 

00:47:53.719 --> 00:47:56.688
And we see houses
there--probably some Greek

00:47:56.688 --> 00:48:01.039
owners, some Roman owners--that
have this same kind of style.

00:48:01.039 --> 00:48:02.039
It's painted.
 

00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:04.389
We see the same zones--I won't
describe them again--

00:48:04.389 --> 00:48:08.373
but the same architectural
zones that we see in the First

00:48:08.373 --> 00:48:11.789
Style paintings in Pompeii and
in Herculaneum.

00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:16.150
And we believe that those are
based on Hellenistic precedents.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:19.099
But they show us again that
this was used in the Greek East.

00:48:19.099 --> 00:48:21.728
It was probably picked up by
some of the traders,

00:48:21.728 --> 00:48:23.920
brought back to Italy,
and used there.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:26.530
The fact that it's a Greek
import is extremely important,

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:29.155
because then we can group it
with all the other Greek imports

00:48:29.155 --> 00:48:31.170
that we've been talking about:
the columns,

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:33.550
the peristyles,
the Alexander mosaic;

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.539
all of the things that the
Romans, the Hellenizing elements

00:48:37.539 --> 00:48:41.597
that we have seen the Romans be
particularly fond of in this

00:48:41.597 --> 00:48:45.586
early period and have used
themselves in their architecture

00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:48.268
and in their architectural
decor.

00:48:48.268 --> 00:48:51.371
So we see that here,
again, the taking over of a

00:48:51.371 --> 00:48:55.068
Greek style of organizing and
decorating a wall for these

00:48:55.068 --> 00:48:56.389
Roman buildings.
 

00:48:56.389 --> 00:49:00.079
This is a house we'll look at
later in the semester at Ostia,

00:49:00.079 --> 00:49:02.951
the port city of Ostia,
the so-called House of Cupid

00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:05.340
and Psyche,
and we see the two lovers here,

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:06.840
on a pedestal in the center.
 

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:08.862
I show it to you here
only--it's a much later

00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:10.590
structure--
but I show it to you only

00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:12.695
because you'll see,
when we get to that,

00:49:12.695 --> 00:49:14.880
that the Romans do--
and we'll see it much earlier

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.163
than that in fact--
the Romans do begin to revet

00:49:17.163 --> 00:49:19.409
some of their structures with
marble--

00:49:19.409 --> 00:49:21.710
this begins already in the age
of Augustus,

00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:24.940
so we'll see it very soon--and
eventually it becomes part of

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:26.199
house design as well.
 

00:49:26.199 --> 00:49:29.413
So while this isn't as
grandiose as a Hellenistic

00:49:29.413 --> 00:49:32.440
palace would've been,
it does give you some idea of

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.376
what a house would look like,
or a palace would look like,

00:49:35.376 --> 00:49:38.110
that had marble on the floor
and marble on the walls.

00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:41.275
And it's this kind of thing
that they are trying to create

00:49:41.275 --> 00:49:43.748
the illusion of--
this is very subtle with

00:49:43.748 --> 00:49:46.197
pastels and so on--
but it's this kind of thing

00:49:46.197 --> 00:49:48.500
that they are trying to create
the illusion of,

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.250
with the Roman First Style.
 

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:55.552
We see First Style Roman wall
painting also in Rome,

00:49:55.552 --> 00:50:00.699
and in fact I can show you an
even more spectacular example in

00:50:00.699 --> 00:50:01.460
Rome.
 

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.353
It's from the House of the
Griffins, and I show you a view

00:50:04.353 --> 00:50:06.130
into a great barrel vaulted
room.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:08.469
We're walking along the
corridor of a great barrel

00:50:08.469 --> 00:50:11.000
vaulted room in the House of the
Griffins in Rome,

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.206
on the Palatine Hill,
in fact, under the later

00:50:14.206 --> 00:50:17.199
imperial palace of the emperor
Domitian.

00:50:17.199 --> 00:50:20.543
It dates to 80 B.C.;
this particular room,

00:50:20.543 --> 00:50:23.539
which we call Room 3,
dates to 80 B.C.

00:50:23.539 --> 00:50:25.929
It's from this room that the
house gets its name.

00:50:25.929 --> 00:50:28.804
You can get a glimpse of--and
I'll show you a better view in a

00:50:28.804 --> 00:50:30.030
moment--of the griffins.
 

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:33.324
There are heraldic griffins in
a lunette, painted red in the

00:50:33.324 --> 00:50:34.050
background.
 

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.869
They're made out of--they're
built up in stucco -- and then

00:50:36.869 --> 00:50:38.619
the lunette itself is painted
red.

00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:41.730
It's from those griffins that
the house got its name.

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:45.112
We are looking down the side of
that house, and we see again

00:50:45.112 --> 00:50:48.378
that is built up in stucco,
so it's still a kind of stucco

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:49.010
relief.
 

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:52.670
But if you look at the
paintings on the walls,

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.713
and on the back wall,
the side wall or the back

00:50:54.713 --> 00:50:56.097
wall--
and I'll show you a better view

00:50:56.097 --> 00:50:57.585
here--
you will see that although we

00:50:57.585 --> 00:51:00.360
are dealing with something that
looks like a First Style wall--

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.255
it's very flat,
it's divided into architectural

00:51:04.255 --> 00:51:06.985
zones: the socle,
the orthostats,

00:51:06.985 --> 00:51:11.074
the isodomic courses here--
that is all done entirely in

00:51:11.074 --> 00:51:12.590
paint,
as you can see.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:13.860
It's not built up as a relief.
 

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:18.110
The only relief here that we
see is the relief that is used

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:22.070
for the heraldic griffins,
up in the uppermost part.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:25.543
When this was in better
condition, a painting was made

00:51:25.543 --> 00:51:28.559
of it, and I show that painting
to you here.

00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:31.655
And I hope this will give you a
better sense than anything else

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:34.550
I've shown you today of how
glorious these things must have

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.538
been in antiquity,
and how again if you stood back

00:51:37.538 --> 00:51:39.541
from them,
you might have been somewhat

00:51:39.541 --> 00:51:39.909
fooled.
 

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:41.909
We see the wall here.
 

00:51:41.909 --> 00:51:45.148
We can see all the components
that we've already described:

00:51:45.148 --> 00:51:47.902
the plinth,
the socle, the orthostats,

00:51:47.902 --> 00:51:51.648
the isodomic courses,
and then the lunette with the

00:51:51.648 --> 00:51:52.960
heraldic griffins.
 

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.344
And again, the whole idea of
this being to give you the

00:51:56.344 --> 00:51:59.920
impression that you are looking
at a real marble wall,

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.710
even though you are looking at
a painted wall.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:09.641
Much more important for the
development of Roman painting is

00:52:09.641 --> 00:52:15.400
another house that I'm going to
show you here,

00:52:21.849 --> 00:52:24.940
which is Room 2,
in the House of the Griffins.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:27.268
And this dates a little bit
later;

00:52:27.268 --> 00:52:30.039
it was done between 80 and 60
B.C.

00:52:30.039 --> 00:52:33.315
And we look at this;
we will see that there are

00:52:33.315 --> 00:52:36.320
beginning to be some important
changes here.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.322
As you look at this--you see
we're looking at a

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.521
barrel-vaulted room,
once again -- all three walls

00:52:42.521 --> 00:52:45.329
well decorated and very well
preserved.

00:52:45.329 --> 00:52:47.190
So we can see exactly what's
going on here.

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:50.284
As we look quickly,
we see remnants of the First

00:52:50.284 --> 00:52:51.139
Style wall.
 

00:52:51.139 --> 00:52:54.706
We see that we have the same
architectural zones--the

00:52:54.706 --> 00:52:58.275
plinths, the orthostats,
the isodomic courses--and we

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.539
have the same idea of marble.
 

00:53:00.539 --> 00:53:03.655
You can see that these
variegated marble blocks and

00:53:03.655 --> 00:53:06.896
these red panels are meant to
look again like marble,

00:53:06.896 --> 00:53:09.639
although this is done entirely
in paint;

00:53:09.639 --> 00:53:13.320
there is no stucco used in this
room whatsoever.

00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.239
Stucco is not used anywhere
here.

00:53:15.239 --> 00:53:19.353
It's completely flat and it is
painted as an illusionistic

00:53:19.353 --> 00:53:19.860
view.
 

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.789
But as we look at this,
we see although we get a sense

00:53:22.789 --> 00:53:25.829
that that First Style wall is
kind of still present,

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:29.449
we also see some again very
important changes.

00:53:29.449 --> 00:53:32.429
We see the way in which they've
treated the socle here,

00:53:32.429 --> 00:53:35.364
to create these kinds of
illusionistic cubes that look

00:53:35.364 --> 00:53:38.300
almost as if they're projecting
out into our space.

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:42.940
Look also at what they've done
by adding columns,

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.481
columns that stand on bases,
this colonnade that seems to

00:53:46.481 --> 00:53:50.074
encircle the room,
the way a peristyle encircles a

00:53:50.074 --> 00:53:52.949
garden court,
this introduction of columnar

00:53:52.949 --> 00:53:53.809
architecture.
 

00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:56.568
Again clearly under the
influence of Greek architecture

00:53:56.568 --> 00:53:59.480
and clearly commensurate with
what they're doing in temple

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.215
architecture,
what they're doing in sanctuary

00:54:03.215 --> 00:54:06.480
architecture,
and also in house architecture.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.010
So we see those columns.
 

00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:11.601
And it looks as if those
columns are resting on bases

00:54:11.601 --> 00:54:15.123
that are represented as if
they're receding into the

00:54:15.123 --> 00:54:16.159
background.
 

00:54:16.159 --> 00:54:19.262
The artist has paid a lot of
attention to trying to render

00:54:19.262 --> 00:54:20.460
them perspectivally.
 

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.329
So although all of this is done
in paint,

00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:26.956
we get the impression that what
we're looking at is a colonnade

00:54:26.956 --> 00:54:29.630
that is in front of the wall--
it projects into the

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.356
spectator's space--
and that what lies behind it is

00:54:33.356 --> 00:54:36.000
a kind of First Style wall.
 

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.260
This is the very beginnings of
what we call Second Style Roman

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.719
wall painting:
this introduction of columns;

00:54:41.719 --> 00:54:44.836
this introduction of elements
that project into the viewer's

00:54:44.836 --> 00:54:46.829
space;
this sense that you are looking

00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:49.516
at two levels of space,
the level of space that is the

00:54:49.516 --> 00:54:52.454
wall, and then the level of
space that projects in front of

00:54:52.454 --> 00:54:52.860
it.
 

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.670
And look at the columns at the
top of the columns.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:57.884
You will see they hold lintels,
but those lintels also are

00:54:57.884 --> 00:55:00.309
shown as if they're receding
into depth,

00:55:00.309 --> 00:55:03.699
and you can sort of barely
see--and you'll see this better

00:55:03.699 --> 00:55:06.139
as you study this in the online
images.

00:55:06.139 --> 00:55:09.628
You'll be able to see the
actual coffered ceiling that is

00:55:09.628 --> 00:55:14.663
represented on the top,
underneath those lintels,

00:55:14.663 --> 00:55:23.130
which again indicate that this
is being represented in depth.

00:55:23.130 --> 00:55:25.260
And here you can see exactly
what they're trying to do.

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:29.161
They're trying to use paint and
only paint to recreate the sort

00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:33.001
of thing that we saw in built
architecture in the oecus

00:55:33.001 --> 00:55:36.338
in the House of the Silver
Wedding: these columns that

00:55:36.338 --> 00:55:38.920
project in front of a painted
wall.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:42.237
This is the pièce de
résistance of what we

00:55:42.237 --> 00:55:44.650
call Second Style Roman wall
painting.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.873
This is the preeminent example
of mature Second Style Roman

00:55:48.873 --> 00:55:50.039
wall painting.
 

00:55:50.039 --> 00:55:53.480
It is a scene in the Villa of
the Mysteries.

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.119
It's in one of the
cubicula;

00:55:55.119 --> 00:55:58.936
cubiculum 16,
at the Villa of the Mysteries

00:55:58.936 --> 00:55:59.949
in Pompeii.
 

00:55:59.949 --> 00:56:03.309
It dates to 60 to 50 B.C.
 

00:56:03.309 --> 00:56:06.927
It's a further development of
what we saw in Room 2 of the

00:56:06.927 --> 00:56:08.449
House of the Griffins.
 

00:56:08.449 --> 00:56:11.739
We see the First Style wall is
still present.

00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:14.159
We see the plinth;
we see the socle;

00:56:14.159 --> 00:56:16.737
we see the orthostats;
we see the isodomic blocks,

00:56:16.737 --> 00:56:19.099
although they are done entirely
in paint.

00:56:19.099 --> 00:56:21.349
Again, no stucco here
whatsoever.

00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:24.614
We see the columns have also
been added, as is typical of

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:25.489
Second Style.
 

00:56:25.489 --> 00:56:28.119
But here the columns are even
more interesting,

00:56:28.119 --> 00:56:30.748
because we can see that the
columns not only project from

00:56:30.748 --> 00:56:33.726
the wall themselves,
but they support an

00:56:33.726 --> 00:56:37.518
entablature--e-n
-t-a-b-l-a-t-u-r-e--

00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:41.030
an entablature which projects
out toward the spectator,

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.905
and they tried to make that
look as if it recedes into

00:56:43.905 --> 00:56:44.340
depth.
 

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:48.286
We see another set of columns
here that support a straight

00:56:48.286 --> 00:56:48.909
lintel.
 

00:56:48.909 --> 00:56:51.672
But then look,
the lintel arches up in the

00:56:51.672 --> 00:56:52.280
center.
 

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.150
This is called an arculated
lintel, an arculated lintel.

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:59.280
We have not seen an arculated
lintel in built architecture.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:01.789
This is very early,
60 to 50 B.C.

00:57:01.789 --> 00:57:03.239
We are seeing it here.
 

00:57:03.239 --> 00:57:06.295
Why are we seeing it here and
why are we not seeing it in

00:57:06.295 --> 00:57:09.351
built architecture is a very
interesting issue and one we

00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:11.369
could debate in the online
forum.

00:57:11.369 --> 00:57:13.487
We see that that First Style
wall has been--oh,

00:57:13.487 --> 00:57:16.110
and we also see columns that
support one of these lintels,

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.905
with a coffered ceiling;
the brown coffered ceiling up

00:57:18.905 --> 00:57:20.099
at the uppermost part.
 

00:57:20.099 --> 00:57:23.487
The First Style wall--this is a
very complex painting and a very

00:57:23.487 --> 00:57:25.530
interesting painting
intellectually.

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:28.188
The First Style wall has
been--it's there,

00:57:28.188 --> 00:57:30.070
but it's been dropped down.
 

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.539
It's been dropped down,
and now we can see something

00:57:33.539 --> 00:57:36.329
that lies behind that First
Style wall.

00:57:36.329 --> 00:57:40.186
We see a view of this round
structure, called a

00:57:40.186 --> 00:57:43.739
tholos--t-h-o-l-o-s;
a round tholos.

00:57:43.739 --> 00:57:46.414
It's like the tholos
that was at the top of the

00:57:46.414 --> 00:57:48.889
Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia,
at Palestrina.

00:57:48.889 --> 00:57:52.994
It's a shrine of some sort,
and that shrine is surrounded

00:57:52.994 --> 00:57:54.018
by blue sky.
 

00:57:54.018 --> 00:57:56.780
So that's something that's
presumably outside.

00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.619
So the First Style wall has
been dropped down,

00:57:59.619 --> 00:58:03.405
and now we have this vista or
panorama of something that lies

00:58:03.405 --> 00:58:04.730
outside the wall.
 

00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:07.389
So we, in a sense,
have three zones of space.

00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:10.119
We have the columns that
project into the spectator's

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:10.539
space.
 

00:58:10.539 --> 00:58:14.094
We have the First Style,
or what's left of the First

00:58:14.094 --> 00:58:15.000
Style wall.
 

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.768
And then we see a view through
the wall, to something that lies

00:58:18.768 --> 00:58:21.199
beyond: a vista,
a panorama, a window.

00:58:21.199 --> 00:58:25.005
It's like opening up the wall
as a window, to what lies

00:58:25.005 --> 00:58:25.639
beyond.
 

00:58:25.639 --> 00:58:27.804
It's fictive again,
in the same way that First

00:58:27.804 --> 00:58:29.440
Style wall painting was fictive.
 

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.235
It creates an illusion of
something that is there,

00:58:32.235 --> 00:58:33.719
that isn't really there.
 

00:58:33.719 --> 00:58:36.873
And it coincides certainly with
the kind of development we've

00:58:36.873 --> 00:58:38.925
been tracing also in built
architecture:

00:58:38.925 --> 00:58:41.659
this opening up of the house;
opening up of the windows;

00:58:41.659 --> 00:58:45.070
opening up bay windows,
to views that lie beyond.

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:48.050
There're also these mysterious
things that are called,

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.643
that people usually refer to as
"the black curtains"

00:58:50.643 --> 00:58:52.260
in Second Style Roman wall
painting.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.905
You can see this black element
that looks almost as if it were

00:58:55.905 --> 00:58:59.373
a curtain that's been dropped
down to reveal the scene that

00:58:59.373 --> 00:59:00.329
lies beyond.
 

00:59:00.329 --> 00:59:02.719
Because of this,
and because of the columns,

00:59:02.719 --> 00:59:06.365
the projecting columns,
many scholars have suggested

00:59:06.365 --> 00:59:10.442
that there's some relationship
between this and theatrical

00:59:10.442 --> 00:59:13.275
architecture--
theatrical architecture that

00:59:13.275 --> 00:59:15.429
was probably stage sets and the
like,

00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:17.300
that were probably initially
made out of wood,

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.500
that don't survive any
longer--and that these may

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.900
imitate some of those stage
sets,

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:25.896
and that this may be an actual
curtain used in theatrical

00:59:25.896 --> 00:59:26.699
performances.
 

00:59:26.699 --> 00:59:30.182
But there are other ways to
think about those black

00:59:30.182 --> 00:59:31.494
curtains,
so to speak,

00:59:31.494 --> 00:59:33.590
and I think we don't have time
to do that here now,

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:37.929
but we should definitely engage
on that in the online forum.

00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:41.539
Oh and I do want to say one
last thing--

00:59:41.539 --> 00:59:43.853
we're going to look at one more
example of Second Style Roman

00:59:43.853 --> 00:59:46.134
wall painting--
one thing, one distinction that

00:59:46.134 --> 00:59:49.331
I want to make between the First
and the Second Style is while

00:59:49.331 --> 00:59:52.579
the First Style of Roman wall
painting was a Greek import,

00:59:52.579 --> 00:59:54.360
there is nothing like the
Second Style,

00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:57.090
as we've just described it,
anywhere in Greek art.

00:59:57.090 --> 01:00:01.230
The Second Style of Roman wall
painting is without any question

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:04.221
a Roman innovation,
and an extraordinary Roman

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:06.778
innovation at that,
and one that is very closely

01:00:06.778 --> 01:00:08.820
allied with developments in
architecture,

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.849
as we've described them.
 

01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:15.268
This is another example,
the Villa of Publius Fannius

01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:18.159
Sinistor: Second Style painting.
 

01:00:18.159 --> 01:00:20.800
Dates to 50 to 40 B.C.
 

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.090
It was in that town of
Boscoreale that I showed you on

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:26.840
the map before,
between Herculaneum and

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.311
Pompeii, and it was removed from
there at one point and made its

01:00:31.311 --> 01:00:32.659
way to New York.
 

01:00:32.659 --> 01:00:35.436
It is now in the Metropolitan,
and has been for a long time,

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:37.130
in the Metropolitan Museum of
Art;

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:39.809
it is usually referred to as
The Met Cubiculum.

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:42.179
And if you haven't seen it,
you should go down and see it.

01:00:42.179 --> 01:00:43.250
It is most extraordinary.
 

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:46.289
They've tried to recreate--the
paintings are all ancient--

01:00:46.289 --> 01:00:49.262
but they've tried to recreate
the ambience by putting a black

01:00:49.262 --> 01:00:51.940
and white mosaic on the floor
and giving us a nice,

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.527
comfortable,
sort of, bed,

01:00:53.527 --> 01:00:57.458
and a footstool over here,
that are just the kind of thing

01:00:57.458 --> 01:01:00.018
that you would've seen in that
room,

01:01:00.018 --> 01:01:01.340
although they don't actually
belong.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:04.210
And they've added a window and
so on and so forth.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:07.909
But the paintings are all
genuine ancient paintings.

01:01:07.909 --> 01:01:10.659
And what's amazing is we have
the entire spread of the room.

01:01:10.659 --> 01:01:14.001
And actually there are mirror
images, the scenes are mirror

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:16.940
images of one another,
across the two long walls.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.659
I want to show you just a
couple of details.

01:01:18.659 --> 01:01:25.898
This is a detail from that room
that shows a tholos seen

01:01:25.898 --> 01:01:28.000
through columns.
 

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.400
Once again we see here--this is
an example of Second Style,

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.599
but it's a little bit more
developed here,

01:01:32.599 --> 01:01:35.675
because you can see that the
First Style wall has really been

01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:37.112
dropped down now,
and, in fact,

01:01:37.112 --> 01:01:38.860
it doesn't even look like a
First Style wall anymore,

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:42.625
it just looks like a red
parapet with a green frieze and

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:44.679
a little cornice at the top.
 

01:01:44.679 --> 01:01:47.260
But it doesn't really look like
a First Style wall.

01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:50.985
In fact, it looks like a wall
with a gate that doesn't look

01:01:50.985 --> 01:01:53.940
like there's any knob or
anything like that;

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.099
so we kind of wonder,
can we get into this?

01:01:56.099 --> 01:01:57.018
Do we have to jump over it?
 

01:01:57.018 --> 01:01:59.280
How do we get from here into
what lies beyond?

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:00.179
We're not absolutely sure.
 

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:03.690
But we see a tholos once
again, one of these sort of

01:02:03.690 --> 01:02:04.719
sacred shrines.
 

01:02:04.719 --> 01:02:08.891
And here you can see it is
surrounded by a peristyle,

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:13.625
by columns: a peristyle just
like one might find in a house,

01:02:13.625 --> 01:02:15.070
or in a villa.
 

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.460
So what are we looking at here?
 

01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:20.260
We see columns that support a
pediment.

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.800
The pediment if you look--a
triangular pediment.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.518
What's interesting about it is
it's broken at the bottom.

01:02:25.518 --> 01:02:27.750
The Greeks would never break
their pediments.

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:31.597
The Romans have broken this
pediment to allow space for the

01:02:31.597 --> 01:02:34.119
tholos to rise up between
it.

01:02:34.119 --> 01:02:35.780
And it's a very interesting
thing to do,

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.626
and it shows while on one hand
they respect ancient Greek

01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:41.119
architecture,
they're also willing to depart

01:02:41.119 --> 01:02:43.480
from it and break the rules,
so to speak.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.259
And we're going to see that's
emphasized by the Romans later

01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:47.579
on.
 

01:02:47.579 --> 01:02:48.809
So the tholos here.
 

01:02:48.809 --> 01:02:50.539
So we have these different
elements.

01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:52.369
We have the columns projecting
toward us.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:54.590
We have the wall of the gateway.
 

01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:58.016
We also have this view through
the window, a picture window,

01:02:58.016 --> 01:02:59.409
into what lies beyond.
 

01:02:59.409 --> 01:03:02.800
And we seem to have these black
curtains again;

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:04.630
in fact, we have three of these
black curtains.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.139
So we ask ourselves again,
what are those exactly?

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:11.148
Another view,
just showing you this in

01:03:11.148 --> 01:03:16.025
relationship to the House of the
Faun, and this whole idea of

01:03:16.025 --> 01:03:20.010
vista and panorama,
from one part to another.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.170
We see the same thing happening
in painting as we see happening

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:22.518
in that.
 

01:03:22.518 --> 01:03:28.768
And then one last detail of the
Publius Fannius Met Cubiculum

01:03:28.768 --> 01:03:30.018
over here.
 

01:03:30.018 --> 01:03:33.547
A very interesting detail,
and I urge you to explore this

01:03:33.547 --> 01:03:36.697
on your own, because it's so
fascinating in detail,

01:03:36.697 --> 01:03:37.768
this doorway.
 

01:03:37.768 --> 01:03:41.541
And then most interesting of
all this panoply of structures

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:44.402
that seem to be piled,
one on top of another,

01:03:44.402 --> 01:03:46.159
in a series of stories.
 

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.559
This again is very early.
 

01:03:47.559 --> 01:03:51.039
It's 50 to 40 B.C.
 

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:54.429
We don't see anything like that
in built architecture then.

01:03:54.429 --> 01:03:56.853
We only see second stories
beginning to be added in

01:03:56.853 --> 01:03:59.481
Pompeian structures,
Herculaneum structures,

01:03:59.481 --> 01:04:01.980
between the earthquake and
Vesuvius,

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:03.789
between 62 and 79.
 

01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:06.378
But here, already,
in the mid-century B.C.,

01:04:06.378 --> 01:04:08.349
we see this depicted in paint.
 

01:04:08.349 --> 01:04:09.590
Is this fanciful?
 

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.554
Is it based on something that
was built in wood that no longer

01:04:12.554 --> 01:04:13.090
survives?
 

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.922
These are questions,
perhaps unanswerable questions,

01:04:15.922 --> 01:04:17.699
but ones well worth pondering.
 

01:04:17.699 --> 01:04:20.827
I want to show you,
in the few minutes that remain,

01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:22.829
just two more houses,
quickly.

01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:25.833
One of them--both of them--are
important though,

01:04:25.833 --> 01:04:28.775
because they belong to the
emperor and empress,

01:04:28.775 --> 01:04:30.630
to Augustus and to Livia.
 

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:34.199
Augustus purchased some
property on the Palatine Hill.

01:04:34.199 --> 01:04:37.297
He wanted to live--as Rome's
first emperor of Rome--he wanted

01:04:37.297 --> 01:04:40.190
to live where Romulus had lived
before him, of course.

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:44.090
And he buys some property up
here, builds a house.

01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:48.097
He puts a temple to his patron
god, right next door,

01:04:48.097 --> 01:04:52.498
Apollo, and then Livia has her
own house right across the

01:04:52.498 --> 01:04:54.619
street: his wife Livia.
 

01:04:54.619 --> 01:04:56.780
She lives with him in his
house, but she's also got her

01:04:56.780 --> 01:04:58.219
own house right across the
street.

01:04:58.219 --> 01:05:03.010
And both of these houses were
decorated with paintings.

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:05.094
I want to show you first the
ones in the House of Augustus,

01:05:05.094 --> 01:05:06.713
the most famous room in the
House of Augustus,

01:05:06.713 --> 01:05:07.900
called the Room of the Masks.
 

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.237
And here is where we see most
clearly the possible

01:05:11.237 --> 01:05:15.599
relationship between Roman wall
painting of the Second Style--

01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:18.139
because this is also Second
Style Roman wall painting--

01:05:18.139 --> 01:05:19.929
and the theater.
 

01:05:19.929 --> 01:05:22.980
If you look at the restored
view at the top,

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.900
of a typical theater
façade,

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.351
as we think it would've
looked--a theater stage

01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:28.342
building,
as we think it would have

01:05:28.342 --> 01:05:30.851
looked early on;
possibly made out of wood,

01:05:30.851 --> 01:05:34.161
again, rather than stone--you
can see it has a central section

01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:36.659
with a pediment,
and then it has two wings.

01:05:36.659 --> 01:05:39.730
And we see the same scheme
here: the central section,

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.253
which is called technically a
regia in theater

01:05:42.253 --> 01:05:44.867
architecture--
r-e-g-i-a--and then two wings

01:05:44.867 --> 01:05:47.909
that are technically called
hospitalia,

01:05:47.909 --> 01:05:52.760
h-o-s-p-i-t-a-l-i-a;
hospitalia.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.179
So this tripartite scheme of a
Roman theater.

01:05:56.179 --> 01:05:59.489
And if that is lost on us,
note that there are masks,

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.934
one on either side,
theatrical masks that also give

01:06:02.934 --> 01:06:06.309
us a hint that we are looking at
a theater set.

01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:09.152
Here's a more vivid view of one
of the walls,

01:06:09.152 --> 01:06:12.639
where you can see that
tripartite division into central

01:06:12.639 --> 01:06:14.320
section and two wings.
 

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.742
You can see the masks,
and you can see a view into

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:21.000
some sort of landscape.
 

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.443
The sky is no longer blue,
it's white, but it does

01:06:23.443 --> 01:06:25.840
continue back beyond,
behind the architecture.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.746
So you get the sense that
you're being beckoned into--in

01:06:28.746 --> 01:06:30.809
fact, there's no barrier here at
all.

01:06:30.809 --> 01:06:32.300
The wall is gone here.
 

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.210
There's no gateway.
 

01:06:33.210 --> 01:06:35.400
You can walk right in to this.
 

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.157
What is this?
 

01:06:36.157 --> 01:06:39.018
There's no blue sky,
so it doesn't look as real as

01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:40.070
the others did.
 

01:06:40.070 --> 01:06:42.664
It's not the sort of thing that
might have been right outside

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:43.789
your window, of a house.
 

01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:45.500
It's some kind of sacred
landscape,

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.349
some kind of strange sacred
landscape,

01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:51.199
with a curved colonnade,
with a tree,

01:06:51.199 --> 01:06:56.230
and with a very phallic-looking
shrine here in the center;

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:58.309
some kind of sacred space.
 

01:06:58.309 --> 01:07:01.547
We call these sacro-idyllic
landscapes: sort of idyllic and

01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:04.730
sacred at the same time that
you're being beckoned into to

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.400
explore.
 

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:08.409
Again, this is a stage set of
some sort?

01:07:08.409 --> 01:07:10.489
Or is it something else?
 

01:07:10.489 --> 01:07:13.659
Is it something that has
religious connotations?

01:07:13.659 --> 01:07:18.327
The other interesting thing
about the Room of the Masks in

01:07:18.327 --> 01:07:23.650
the House of Augustus is that
some scholars have claimed that,

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:26.164
although it is usually said
that one-point linear

01:07:26.164 --> 01:07:28.706
perspective,
in which all lines converge at

01:07:28.706 --> 01:07:32.226
a single point in the distance,
was invented in the

01:07:32.226 --> 01:07:37.237
Renaissance, a case can be made
that it was invented in Roman

01:07:37.237 --> 01:07:37.989
times.
 

01:07:37.989 --> 01:07:41.436
And if it happened,
it happened here in this house

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:42.672
where--
and scholars,

01:07:42.672 --> 01:07:45.391
even of the Renaissance,
have studied the way in which

01:07:45.391 --> 01:07:47.530
these points converge in this
painting,

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:50.449
all the way to a point at the
end.

01:07:50.449 --> 01:07:53.193
So if that's true,
the Romans may have done that,

01:07:53.193 --> 01:07:55.710
perhaps inadvertently,
perhaps on purpose.

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.110
They were very interested in
perspective.

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:59.400
I'll say a bit more about that
in a moment.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.585
But if they invented it here,
they quickly rejected it,

01:08:02.585 --> 01:08:05.360
as we're going to see in next
week's lecture.

01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:08.032
Just a couple of details:
the mask and the beautiful way

01:08:08.032 --> 01:08:09.880
in which this very talented
artist,

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.699
probably one of the best
artists of the day,

01:08:11.699 --> 01:08:16.672
has built up this mask out of
touches of grey and white and

01:08:16.672 --> 01:08:21.029
black;
an extraordinary thing.

01:08:21.029 --> 01:08:24.921
And then again I really do urge
you to look at these paintings

01:08:24.921 --> 01:08:28.560
in detail, because if you do you
will be very rewarded.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:31.966
You'll see all kinds of strange
creatures, like winged figures,

01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:34.329
this very strange thing lurking
up there.

01:08:34.329 --> 01:08:36.260
Is that vegetal? Is it animal?
 

01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.680
Is it human? What is that?
 

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.962
These wonderful,
what look like swans,

01:08:39.962 --> 01:08:42.060
golden swans that decorate
this.

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.854
When you look very close,
you can see there's a figural

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:45.578
frieze here.
 

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:48.975
And look at that wonderful
representation of the fruit or

01:08:48.975 --> 01:08:52.413
vegetables in a bowl,
a bowl that is represented so

01:08:52.413 --> 01:08:55.630
magnificently and translucently
by the artist.

01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:58.890
In the maybe three minutes or
so that remain,

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:02.038
I want to show you one last
painting,

01:09:02.038 --> 01:09:04.100
and it's a very special
painting indeed,

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:06.743
and I think it ties together
everything that we've been

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:07.819
talking about today.
 

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.319
It is a painting from,
not the House of Livia,

01:09:11.319 --> 01:09:12.738
where there are some preserved
paintings--

01:09:12.738 --> 01:09:15.621
we're not going to look at
those--but from a villa of

01:09:15.621 --> 01:09:17.872
Livia,
located north of Rome at a

01:09:17.872 --> 01:09:20.905
place called Primaporta:
the Villa of Livia at

01:09:20.905 --> 01:09:21.850
Primaporta.
 

01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:25.780
And it is in a sense the
ultimate example and a very last

01:09:25.780 --> 01:09:28.800
gasp of Second Style Roman wall
painting.

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:32.380
The villa was put up in 30 to
25 B.C.

01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:36.408
A barrel-vaulted room was
decorated with this gardenscape.

01:09:36.408 --> 01:09:38.581
Now as you look at this,
you'd probably say to me:

01:09:38.581 --> 01:09:41.328
"That doesn't look like
anything we've looked at today.

01:09:41.328 --> 01:09:44.247
There's no architecture there,
there's no remnants of a First

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:44.880
Style wall.
 

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.409
There are no projecting columns.
 

01:09:46.409 --> 01:09:47.779
There are no black curtains.
 

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:49.029
And so on and so forth.
 

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:51.500
It's very different from
anything we've seen."

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:53.539
But we categorize this as a
Second Style wall.

01:09:53.539 --> 01:09:54.939
Why do we do that?
 

01:09:54.939 --> 01:09:57.743
Because there's a division
between where we stand as

01:09:57.743 --> 01:10:00.658
spectator and the space that
lies beyond the fence.

01:10:00.658 --> 01:10:03.488
There is a fence that divides
our space from the space that

01:10:03.488 --> 01:10:07.581
lies outside,
but it's a very delicate fence,

01:10:07.581 --> 01:10:09.764
a white,
kind of lattice fence,

01:10:09.764 --> 01:10:12.752
not unlike the one we saw in
the Samnite House on the second

01:10:12.752 --> 01:10:13.210
story.
 

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:15.456
We don't have columns,
we have trees,

01:10:15.456 --> 01:10:17.640
a different kind of upright
here.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.851
But what connects this to the
Second Style is that it is the

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:25.993
ultimate example of a Roman
painting as a panoramic picture

01:10:25.993 --> 01:10:26.779
window.
 

01:10:26.779 --> 01:10:30.118
This is what they hoped you
would see when you looked out of

01:10:30.118 --> 01:10:33.230
the rooms of your house,
of your great bay window in the

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:34.760
Villa of the Mysteries.
 

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.658
If you didn't see the sea,
you would see some glorious

01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:42.189
landscape, a gardenscape,
outside of your window,

01:10:42.189 --> 01:10:44.029
with beautiful trees.
 

01:10:44.029 --> 01:10:46.555
If you look at these with care,
you will see that this is an

01:10:46.555 --> 01:10:48.609
artist who understood nature and
observed it,

01:10:48.609 --> 01:10:52.238
who knew the difference among
the fruits that would be on

01:10:52.238 --> 01:10:54.851
trees like this--
there are fruit trees here--

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.715
who had a sense of the way in
which birds would alight on a

01:10:57.715 --> 01:10:59.590
leaf,
if they were headed toward one;

01:10:59.590 --> 01:11:03.877
who had a sense of the way in
which leaves would rustle in the

01:11:03.877 --> 01:11:05.936
breeze;
who had a sense of the way in

01:11:05.936 --> 01:11:09.086
which light can fall differently
on a leaf, so that you sometimes

01:11:09.086 --> 01:11:11.350
see the lighted side or the side
in shadow.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:15.128
This is an artist who has
really observed nature and has

01:11:15.128 --> 01:11:16.710
depicted what he saw.
 

01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.037
And here are a couple of
details where you can see that

01:11:19.037 --> 01:11:20.158
very well, of this tree.
 

01:11:20.158 --> 01:11:22.788
You see what I mean by some
leaves cast in shadows;

01:11:22.788 --> 01:11:25.510
some leaves have light shining
on them.

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:27.430
You get a sense of the breeze.
 

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:31.134
You get this wonderful way in
which this black bird alights on

01:11:31.134 --> 01:11:34.733
the edge of a leaf,
this bird over here surveying

01:11:34.733 --> 01:11:37.753
this piece of fruit,
deciding whether he wants to

01:11:37.753 --> 01:11:38.500
peck it or not.
 

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.158
This is very sophisticated
stuff.

01:11:40.158 --> 01:11:44.515
And you can also see,
if you explore this painting a

01:11:44.515 --> 01:11:46.936
bit more,
that it has and that it

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:50.399
partakes of what we call today
atmospheric perspective,

01:11:50.399 --> 01:11:53.520
not one-point perspective,
but atmospheric perspective.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.340
What is atmospheric perspective?
 

01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.027
If you look at this carefully,
you will see that all of the

01:11:58.027 --> 01:12:00.296
items that are in--all the
objects that are in the

01:12:00.296 --> 01:12:02.288
foreground have very distinct
outlines;

01:12:02.288 --> 01:12:04.960
whereas those in the middle
ground are a little fuzzier;

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:07.600
and those way in the background
are fuzzier still.

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:10.350
And there are actually--you
probably could barely see them--

01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:12.430
but there are actually
mountains in the distance,

01:12:12.430 --> 01:12:15.097
and those mountains in the
distance are so fuzzy in their

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.100
silhouette that you can barely
see them.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.796
But you get this sense of
space, of moving back,

01:12:19.796 --> 01:12:22.609
because of this use of
atmospheric perspective.

01:12:22.609 --> 01:12:25.840
So this, the ultimate Roman
painting,

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:29.189
Second Style,
the Roman painting as panorama,

01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:32.198
that again corresponds so well
to all the discussions we've

01:12:32.198 --> 01:12:35.260
been having the last couple of
lectures of this move towards

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:37.930
increased vista,
increased panorama,

01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.510
both in painting and also in
architecture.

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:42.199
Thanks guys.

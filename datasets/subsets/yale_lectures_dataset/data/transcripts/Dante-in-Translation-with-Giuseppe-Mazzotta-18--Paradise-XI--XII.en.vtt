00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.445
Prof: Last time we got
into Canto X and I began with

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:11.184
the Heaven of the Sun,
and I began with the

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:14.774
description of--
Dante begins,

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:18.820
we went over the phases of the
canto.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.330
On the one hand the description
of the Trinity of the inner life

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.050
of the Trinity as a life of
love,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:36.740
the breath and the father--
love, the sun,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.940
the father bound by the breath
of love as it were.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.057
Then Dante moves onto a
description of the spectacle of

00:00:49.057 --> 00:00:53.231
the whole--
this heaven and of this

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:59.810
fragment of the cosmos by
turning to us readers twice,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.840
asking us to look up.
 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.864
It is that by looking up we can
see the givenness of creation,

00:01:07.864 --> 00:01:11.420
the fact that this has been
given;

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.000
it's a gift to us.
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.629
It's also a way of--if it's a
gift,

00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:24.310
if there's an economy,
a feel economy in the cosmos,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.864
it's a divine economy,
it also means that somehow we

00:01:29.864 --> 00:01:33.349
cannot really claim to own it.
 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:38.706
That seems to be a natural
consequence of something being a

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:43.046
gift does not imply,
does not entail necessarily

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:48.804
ownership of this gift;
it has been given and therefore

00:01:48.804 --> 00:01:54.489
we are invited to have an
aesthetic admiration of it.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.760
This kind of--this scene of the
divine,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.519
even a kind of feel drama,
a divine drama,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:07.885
a spectacle that unfolds
ends--folds throughout the

00:02:07.885 --> 00:02:11.568
cosmos,
ends with a description of the

00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:15.688
encyclopedia as I was describing
it to you.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:22.330
That is to say with Aquinas who
recounts the names and mentions

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.579
one after the other,
the twelve representatives of

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.150
various disciplines.
 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.508
We talked a little bit about
Solomon and the scandal that his

00:02:36.508 --> 00:02:41.280
inclusion here caused in Dante's
own time,

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.265
since Dante is responding to a
real crisis about unknowledge of

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:50.660
the ultimate fate of Solomon,
the wisest of all men.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.803
Was he saved or not on account
of his weaknesses in terms of

00:02:57.803 --> 00:03:00.710
his, well his lechery?
 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.961
Then the canto focuses on--ends
really with Siger of Brabant who

00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:13.610
was a logician,
a philosopher and Dante

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.188
describes him really on the way
to knowledge.

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:21.710
He was a heretic,
he was viewed of as a heretic.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.502
Dante dismisses that whole
charge, and in many ways he

00:03:26.502 --> 00:03:29.848
represents therefore knowledge
as--

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:33.705
or the circle of knowledge as
one made of contradictory

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:35.638
voices,
where those who had been

00:03:35.638 --> 00:03:39.092
blaming Siger of Brabant,
such as Aquinas himself,

00:03:39.092 --> 00:03:43.949
now retract their positions;
so the whole process of getting

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:47.646
to know the world is one of
errors and it's one of

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:48.780
retractions.
 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.139
There are some interesting
details that I could even--I

00:03:54.139 --> 00:04:00.094
think that I should even mention
to you as we approach XI and

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:00.889
XII.
 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:08.098
Siger is described as he's
absorbed in his grave thoughts.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:11.602
In Italian it is gravi
pensieri,

00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:16.579
the word pensiero is,
in English, is pensive.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.221
I think that that is such a
remarkable word because it

00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:25.250
really means "to
think" in Latin,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.420
and they always exploit this
resonance of the verb--

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.490
means to be at an impasse,
to be suspended literally,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.579
so he's suspended in thoughts
as if the thoughts could not

00:04:41.579 --> 00:04:47.244
quite make him reach the
threshold of the knowledge he

00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:48.420
wanted.
 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.591
At any rate,
that's the way Canto X--that's

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.480
the economy of Canto X.
 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.394
I want to--since there are
three cantos that go together to

00:04:57.394 --> 00:05:00.975
really--
I ask you to turn to the end of

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:05.529
Canto XII where Bonaventure,
who is a Franciscan,

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:09.100
you probably know what is meant
by that.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.319
The Franciscan is one of the
orders of Francis,

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.490
just as Aquinas is Dominican.
 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.247
The Franciscans are those who
believe in the priority of will

00:05:18.247 --> 00:05:20.439
and love in the act of
knowledge.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.810
The Dominicans or
neo-Aristotelians like Aquinas

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.577
believe in the priority of the
intellect in the apprehension of

00:05:30.577 --> 00:05:31.879
the world.
 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:36.387
The Dominicans were founded
with the explicit mandate to

00:05:36.387 --> 00:05:41.389
teach in the universities where
heresies they thought abounded

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.750
and therefore they had to
extirpate,

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.360
block off the routes of
heresies.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.016
The Franciscans were going to
be witnessing in the world,

00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:57.091
and both orders are shaped by a
belief in poverty that we have

00:05:57.091 --> 00:05:59.420
to examine a little bit.
 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.209
We have to understand what it
means.

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:05.161
At any rate,
Bonaventure is a Franciscan and

00:06:05.161 --> 00:06:10.033
by the end of Canto XII,
after he has been chronicling

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.240
the life of Dominic.
 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.528
This is sort of another case of
extraordinary openness of,

00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:21.261
in Dante's view,
of these characters in the

00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:25.163
sense that the Franciscans and
Dominicans were really at odds

00:06:25.163 --> 00:06:28.461
with each other,
both in terms of their

00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:34.899
theologies and their premises,
intellectual premises above all.

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:39.468
Here, Dante has a Franciscan
tell the life of Dominic just as

00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:43.886
earlier in Canto XI a Dominican,
Aquinas, tells the life of

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:44.800
Francis.
 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.641
The two cantos are controlled
by what we call a chiasmus

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.988
that's--
this is a chiasmus from the

00:06:51.988 --> 00:06:56.600
Greek word "chi,"
a chiasmus, right?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:02.435
You have an intersection of
voices, a sort of--a sense of

00:07:02.435 --> 00:07:07.230
the interdependence of the two
perspectives.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.964
I will say a little bit more
about Bonaventure after I read

00:07:10.964 --> 00:07:12.060
this paragraph.
 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.601
This paragraph here,
the last paragraph in Canto

00:07:14.601 --> 00:07:16.798
XII,
lines 130 and following,

00:07:16.798 --> 00:07:20.889
sort of functions as a
counterweight to the description

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:25.661
of the encyclopedia that Aquinas
had given at the end of Canto X

00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:30.057
and ending with Siger of Brabant
so let me just see who the

00:07:30.057 --> 00:07:31.800
people are here.
 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.257
"I am the living soul of
Bonaventura of Bagnorea,

00:07:36.257 --> 00:07:40.970
who in great offices ever put
last the left-hand care.

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:44.586
Here are Illuminato and
Augustine, who were among the

00:07:44.586 --> 00:07:48.759
first barefoot Poor Brothers
that in the cord made themselves

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:50.430
God's friends."
 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.362
Then a theorist of medieval
encyclopedias,

00:07:54.362 --> 00:07:55.418
Hugh of St.
 

00:07:55.418 --> 00:08:00.598
Victor, a Parisian friar who
really wrote the so called

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:04.338
Didascalicon,
which is a text about what

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:08.560
is--what are the stages of
education?

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.307
How does the mind come to the
knowledge of God starting from

00:08:14.307 --> 00:08:18.399
the small elements in the
outside life,

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:21.069
the material world,
then the interior lights,

00:08:21.069 --> 00:08:24.839
etc., before reaching
the--God's supreme light?

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.649
Then is here with them Peter
the bookworm,

00:08:27.649 --> 00:08:31.086
Peter the Spaniard,
another theorist of medieval

00:08:31.086 --> 00:08:34.158
logic who shines below in twelve
books,

00:08:34.158 --> 00:08:38.809
then Nathan the prophet--I'll
come back to this name,

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:40.399
the prophet Nathan.
 

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.552
He is known,
to those who know,

00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:48.909
as being David's bad
conscience, or good conscience,

00:08:48.909 --> 00:08:54.690
the one who is pricking him to
think about himself.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:01.220
Nathan, the prophet sensor
counselor of the King,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.610
a little bit more about him in
a while and Chrysostom,

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.740
the Metropolitan,
meaning that guy with the

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.860
golden mouth.
 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:14.100
Language here is the flower of
eloquence is what he possesses.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:20.451
And Anselm, another theologian
who writes about the reasons for

00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:24.943
the incarnations,
famous texts about why did God

00:09:24.943 --> 00:09:29.589
become a man and then Donatus
"who deigned to set his

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:32.360
hand to the first art;
grammar.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.327
So you see you have the whole
array, the whole wide spectrum

00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:37.090
of what we call the
encyclopedia.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:42.043
Logic, eloquence,
grammar, Donatus is a Roman

00:09:42.043 --> 00:09:45.697
grammarian,
and then Rabanus a historian,

00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:49.779
"and beside me shines the
Calabrian Abbot Joachim,

00:09:49.779 --> 00:09:54.840
who was endowed with a spirit
of prophecy.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.520
The glowing courtesy and
well-judged language of Brother

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.269
Thomas have moved me to
celebrate so great a paladin,

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:06.500
and with me have moved this
company."

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:11.880
Bonaventure ends with the tip
of the hat in the direction of

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.528
Aquinas whose example he has
followed.

00:10:15.528 --> 00:10:19.493
An example, once again,
of a dialogue and openness

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:24.427
between the two orders and the
two members of different orders

00:10:24.427 --> 00:10:27.663
and yet--
and somehow interdependent with

00:10:27.663 --> 00:10:28.509
each other.
 

00:10:28.509 --> 00:10:33.379
Now the presence of Abbot
Joachim is another counterweight

00:10:33.379 --> 00:10:36.200
to Siger of Brabant in Canto X.
 

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.037
He too, Joachim,
whom you have met because I

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:43.259
sort of mentioned his name to
you in discussing the prophecy--

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:47.500
glossing the prophecy of the
DXV in Purgatorio XXXIII.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.918
You remember where I tried to
explain it;

00:10:49.918 --> 00:10:53.994
there seems to be a kind of
apocalyptic meaning to that

00:10:53.994 --> 00:10:56.667
prophecy,
the numerical enigma,

00:10:56.667 --> 00:11:01.802
an enigmatic prophecy about the
coming of Christ at the end of

00:11:01.802 --> 00:11:04.682
time,
who will come and therefore the

00:11:04.682 --> 00:11:07.558
prophecy of the consummation of
history,

00:11:07.558 --> 00:11:10.460
and the consummation of time,
the DXV,

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.548
the 500,10, and 5 as that is
called.

00:11:13.548 --> 00:11:19.131
And I said that the joachistic
interpretation of that emblem,

00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:23.320
of that symbol seemed to me to
be accurate.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.206
I really meant,
it really sort of introduces

00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:30.587
the idea of the end of time,
however, I rejected--I asked

00:11:30.587 --> 00:11:35.019
you to also reject the
implications of that prophecy.

00:11:35.019 --> 00:11:39.765
The joachistic prophecy--it was
viewed as heretical for a number

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.500
of important reasons.
 

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:47.279
It expresses a sort of
impatience about history.

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:50.440
That is to say it really
believes, first of all,

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.308
in the imminent and closure of
history,

00:11:55.308 --> 00:12:00.509
the end is close at hand,
and this is a kind of--

00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:07.990
the end of history implies the
coming into being of a utopia,

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:10.970
a utopia of the spirit,
the third age of the spirit,

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.503
when finally all institutions,
all barriers are shattered and

00:12:15.503 --> 00:12:16.408
torn down.
 

00:12:16.408 --> 00:12:20.581
This is a kind of--this is
really what--from Dante's point

00:12:20.581 --> 00:12:24.899
of view would be wrong with a
joachistic utopian impulse.

00:12:24.899 --> 00:12:29.153
The idea that it always begs
for a closure of what we can

00:12:29.153 --> 00:12:32.716
never really fathom,
which is the world of

00:12:32.716 --> 00:12:37.051
historical occurrences,
but another reason why he was

00:12:37.051 --> 00:12:40.418
viewed as heretical by exactly
Bonaventure,

00:12:40.418 --> 00:12:45.496
it was Bonaventure who asked
that his views be damned and now

00:12:45.496 --> 00:12:48.460
he is sort of writing a
palinode.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.288
Dante allows him to make amends
for the previous condemnation.

00:12:53.288 --> 00:12:58.403
Bonaventure found objectionable
the ideas of Joachim of Flora

00:12:58.403 --> 00:13:03.260
because Joachim de facto is
dissolving the whole notion of

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.500
the unity of the Trinitarian
life.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.308
He theorizes an idea of
history, a tripartite idea of

00:13:11.308 --> 00:13:16.211
history according to the three
persons of the Trinity:

00:13:16.211 --> 00:13:20.658
the age of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

00:13:20.658 --> 00:13:23.625
He believes there was once,
in biblical times,

00:13:23.625 --> 00:13:27.120
there was the age of the
Father, God was understood as

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.110
the Father.
 

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:32.847
Then we enter the age of the
Son, brotherhoods of all,

00:13:32.847 --> 00:13:37.048
and now the spiritual age of
the Holy Spirit.

00:13:37.048 --> 00:13:40.340
De facto really means that the
three ways--

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.692
the three manifestations,
this kind of complex way of

00:13:44.692 --> 00:13:49.548
understanding a unity from
different viewpoints is actually

00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:50.720
dissolved.
 

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.908
It becomes separate,
each person of the Trinity

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:58.743
becomes a separate entity,
and that view from--for

00:13:58.743 --> 00:14:03.150
Bonaventure was heretical,
he condemns it,

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:06.844
now he acknowledges that he
actually was Abbot Joachim who

00:14:06.844 --> 00:14:09.500
was endowed with a spiritual
prophecy.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.899
It is something only prophetic,
in other words,

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:17.587
what seemed to here heresy,
an intellectual question of

00:14:17.587 --> 00:14:23.592
thoughts and opinions now
appears as some divination about

00:14:23.592 --> 00:14:29.129
things to come,
not specified any further.

00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:31.793
Retrospectively,
it's Dante himself who is

00:14:31.793 --> 00:14:35.370
legitimizing Joachim and
therefore also legitimizing his

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.879
own position in Canto XXXIII of
Purgatorio.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:43.250
Dante shares the view of the
apocalyptic denuma of history,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:48.505
however, he refuses,
he rejects the idea that it's

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:54.298
possible to establish a date for
such an occurrence.

00:14:54.298 --> 00:14:58.210
Joachim appears now as a
visionary among them.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.403
The other figure that I would
like to say something about is

00:15:01.403 --> 00:15:03.950
Nathan the prophet for a very
simple reason,

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.830
because Nathan as you probably
know--

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.287
because it's very strange,
why would Dante include Nathan

00:15:10.287 --> 00:15:12.980
a prophet among--
there's Joachim of Flora who is

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.821
prophetic,
but why include Nathan among

00:15:15.821 --> 00:15:17.428
these wise spirits?
 

00:15:17.428 --> 00:15:19.509
I mean, he could have chosen so
many others.

00:15:19.509 --> 00:15:24.339
He could have chosen those who
actually have written and whose

00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:26.871
works are canonical in the
Bible.

00:15:26.871 --> 00:15:28.058
He doesn't.
 

00:15:28.058 --> 00:15:32.240
He chooses Nathan and the idea
is, I think,

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.158
a little bit of an
autobiographical,

00:15:36.158 --> 00:15:40.990
a pun about Dante himself,
because Nathan,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:44.168
the word Nathan means "he
who gives."

00:15:44.168 --> 00:15:47.948
In other words,
Dante saw in the name of Nathan

00:15:47.948 --> 00:15:50.577
his own name,
and it pleases him,

00:15:50.577 --> 00:15:54.029
that's what Dante means,
he who gives.

00:15:54.029 --> 00:15:58.879
Nathan becomes a kind of mask
for Dante himself.

00:15:58.879 --> 00:16:03.624
It is as if he were saying,
had I another life or a

00:16:03.624 --> 00:16:08.937
posthumous life in the heavenly
apotheosis that's where I

00:16:08.937 --> 00:16:13.087
probably would like--
that's where I probably will

00:16:13.087 --> 00:16:14.846
end up,
certainly that's what I would

00:16:14.846 --> 00:16:17.975
like to be,
so in Nathan there is a mask

00:16:17.975 --> 00:16:19.178
for himself.
 

00:16:19.178 --> 00:16:25.835
Now why--what is this so
peculiar about this encyclopedic

00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:30.590
ordering of the arts and the
sciences?

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.740
It doesn't really differ very
much from Aquinas,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:40.288
but it's interesting that it's
Bonaventure who articulates,

00:16:40.288 --> 00:16:44.470
who voices this kind of--who
celebrates all these names and

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.784
all these arts because
Bonaventure is himself a

00:16:47.784 --> 00:16:51.533
theorist of the encyclopedia
very much as Hugh of St.

00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:55.857
Victor, but he has one crucial
reflection at the beginning of

00:16:55.857 --> 00:16:57.658
his encyclopedia.
 

00:16:57.658 --> 00:17:01.869
He says that the activity of
knowing and learning is like

00:17:01.869 --> 00:17:04.048
going up and down a ladder.
 

00:17:04.048 --> 00:17:06.578
You might say,
if you read that metaphor,

00:17:06.578 --> 00:17:09.837
you might say well that's an
extraordinary metaphor but it's

00:17:09.837 --> 00:17:12.710
the metaphor of the ladder of
Jacob in the Bible,

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:14.380
which is where he probably
found it.

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:18.578
The ladder of Plato,
that's where this idea that we

00:17:18.578 --> 00:17:21.334
ascend,
the mind ascends when we learn

00:17:21.334 --> 00:17:23.958
something,
when we get educated the mind

00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:26.328
goes up and it actually can go
down.

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:30.915
The interesting thing about
Bonaventure is that he goes on

00:17:30.915 --> 00:17:35.502
saying that as in a ladder the
lowest rung are always more

00:17:35.502 --> 00:17:40.663
important than the higher ones,
because without those no one of

00:17:40.663 --> 00:17:43.950
us would be capable to climb up
the ladder,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.838
so the lowest,
the lowly forms of knowledge,

00:17:47.838 --> 00:17:52.234
grammar--the external lights of
the senses you see

00:17:52.234 --> 00:17:56.134
distinguishes--
his is a theory of knowledge as

00:17:56.134 --> 00:18:00.006
a proliferation of lights,
as a universe of lights,

00:18:00.006 --> 00:18:02.915
internal, external lights,
internal lights,

00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:06.405
the lights of the senses,
the lights that come to us from

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:08.828
books and the light of God and
so on.

00:18:08.828 --> 00:18:11.821
So we are always going to be
enlightened in our process,

00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:14.380
but as we are enlightened the
lowest lights are,

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.230
first of all,
self-sufficient.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.565
There are those who may not be
capable of ascending much higher

00:18:21.565 --> 00:18:26.038
in the--along the ladder than
the first few rungs.

00:18:26.038 --> 00:18:28.840
There is already a
self-sufficient knowledge that

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.950
they can acquire.
 

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:34.393
The arts of--to him the arts of
poetry that's the lowest rung

00:18:34.393 --> 00:18:38.762
and yet that is its own self
sufficiency and then you can go

00:18:38.762 --> 00:18:41.798
up the ladder and really learn
more--

00:18:41.798 --> 00:18:46.339
but the interesting thing about
the ladder is that there is no

00:18:46.339 --> 00:18:48.656
sense,
though it establishes a

00:18:48.656 --> 00:18:53.240
hierarchy, in that hierarchy the
lower elements are as crucial as

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:58.222
the higher elements,
because without the lower rungs

00:18:58.222 --> 00:19:02.328
you never really can go up to
the end.

00:19:02.328 --> 00:19:06.900
So this is another image then
of the--

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.420
finally let me just say with
the Joachim,

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:17.724
the inclusion of Joachim,
here we are getting into the

00:19:17.724 --> 00:19:24.713
erasure of strict barriers,
strict boundaries between what

00:19:24.713 --> 00:19:28.140
is heretical and what is
canonical.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.750
I think this is the sort of
openness,

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:37.038
Dante's openness that somehow
reverberates with the lesson of

00:19:37.038 --> 00:19:40.861
Francis and Dominic,
and therefore now,

00:19:40.861 --> 00:19:43.450
let me turn to those two
cantos.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.630
Keep in mind then as we read
Canto XI,

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.840
we are again--I repeat in the
Heaven of the Sun and I don't

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.784
know that the passage that I
read to you from the pseudo

00:19:57.784 --> 00:20:02.905
Dionysus last time about the
divine names where the pseudo

00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:08.298
Dionysus goes on talking about
why is the metaphor of the sun

00:20:08.298 --> 00:20:13.598
such a fundamental image for the
divine generosity.

00:20:13.598 --> 00:20:19.436
This is as an image of the sun
that always gives of itself

00:20:19.436 --> 00:20:25.069
without ever asking anything
back so it's an activity of

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:28.641
purely--
pure generosity and I think

00:20:28.641 --> 00:20:33.724
that's a Franciscan image of--
also of poverty to which I will

00:20:33.724 --> 00:20:35.578
talk about in a moment.
 

00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:39.290
The Canto XI,
I repeat, ends with the

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.930
extraordinary encomium of Siger
of Brabant;

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:51.750
by a counterpoint Canto XI has
an apostrophe against logical,

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:55.269
legal forms of knowledge.
 

00:20:55.269 --> 00:20:59.513
The kind of knowledge that
tries to define the world in

00:20:59.513 --> 00:21:03.633
formulas and so Dante begins--
this is Dante speaking on his

00:21:03.633 --> 00:21:06.678
own--in his own voice,
"Oh insensate care of

00:21:06.678 --> 00:21:09.275
mortals,
how vain are the reasonings

00:21:09.275 --> 00:21:12.858
that make thee beat thy wings in
downward flight!

00:21:12.858 --> 00:21:14.970
One was going after law,
another after the

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.627
Aphorisms,
one following the priesthood

00:21:17.627 --> 00:21:20.420
and another seeking to rule by
force or craft,

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.348
one set on robbery and another
on affairs of state,

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:26.380
one labouring in the toils of
fleshly delights,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.400
and another given up to
idleness;

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:32.769
while I, set free from all
these things,

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:37.925
was high in heaven with
Beatrice, received thus

00:21:37.925 --> 00:21:40.279
gloriously."
 

00:21:40.279 --> 00:21:45.050
I think it's an interesting
counterpoint between these icons

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:49.578
of power that derive from the
study of low and logic,

00:21:49.578 --> 00:21:53.897
and then on the other hand,
this--Dante's own self

00:21:53.897 --> 00:21:59.009
reference to himself as free
from all of these concerns.

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:05.363
I think this idea of freedom
will be the dominant theme of

00:22:05.363 --> 00:22:06.588
Canto XI.
 

00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:10.319
Who--it continues then,
"When each had come back

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:14.050
to the point of the circle where
it was before,"

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.848
the two wheels of dancing old
men,

00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:19.269
holding their hands around the
sun,

00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:23.990
which is a metaphorical sun--so
that the universe is not even--

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.358
is not heliocentric.
 

00:22:26.358 --> 00:22:29.096
Dante's universe--they're going
to move now beyond the sun,

00:22:29.096 --> 00:22:31.548
"is stopped like a candle
on its stand."

00:22:31.548 --> 00:22:38.034
And then there is a little
prayer here and the introduction

00:22:38.034 --> 00:22:40.731
of the two,
Dominic and Francis,

00:22:40.731 --> 00:22:43.788
lines 30 and following:
"The Providence that rules

00:22:43.788 --> 00:22:47.017
the world with that counsel in
which every created site is

00:22:47.017 --> 00:22:50.584
vanquished before it reaches the
bottom- in order that the bride

00:22:50.584 --> 00:22:52.891
of Him who,
with loud cries,

00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:57.202
wedded her with His sacred
blood should go to her Beloved

00:22:57.202 --> 00:23:01.281
secure in herself and
faithfuller to Him- ordained for

00:23:01.281 --> 00:23:06.440
her behoof two princes to be her
guides on this side and that.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.440
The one was all seraphic in
ardour,"

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.230
and that's Francis,
"the other, for wisdom,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:16.068
was on earth a splendour of
cherubic light.

00:23:16.068 --> 00:23:18.461
I shall tell of the one,
since to praise one,

00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:20.690
whichever we take,
is to speak of both;

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.470
for the labours where to one
end."

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.605
That's really the formula that
seals the sense of the

00:23:28.605 --> 00:23:34.727
interdependence of intellect and
will of love and knowledge and

00:23:34.727 --> 00:23:36.900
of the two voices.
 

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:41.430
Now this is the--what we call a
hagiography or a legend,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.470
the life of a saint,
a saint's life of Francis,

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:50.279
which is told by Aquinas,
by the Dominican Aquinas.

00:23:50.279 --> 00:23:53.750
What we are told is,
first of all--"Between the

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.696
Topino and the water that falls
from the hill chosen by the

00:23:57.696 --> 00:24:01.916
blessed Ubaldo hangs a fertile
slope of the lofty mountain from

00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:05.660
which Perugia feels cold and
heat at Porta Sole,

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.028
and behind it Nocera and Gualdo
grieve under a heavy yoke."

00:24:10.028 --> 00:24:14.721
It's an extraordinarily
localized representation of

00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.410
Francis' origin.
 

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.146
It's a topography,
he was born as you know in

00:24:19.146 --> 00:24:21.420
Assisi,
but it's almost as if he were

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.640
just placing him in a specific
place,

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:29.170
near the gate that leads--on
the road to Perugia;

00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:35.335
very precise and it's called
Porta Sole, more about this in a

00:24:35.335 --> 00:24:36.259
moment.
 

00:24:36.259 --> 00:24:39.113
"From this slope,
where it most breaks its

00:24:39.113 --> 00:24:40.934
steepness,
a sun,"

00:24:40.934 --> 00:24:45.897
now we go from the toponymic,
the name of a place,

00:24:45.897 --> 00:24:53.029
the gate of the sun-- -to a
metaphor for Francis as the sun.

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:56.040
He is the sun,
so we are in the Heaven of the

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.874
Sun and now Dante invests
Francis with all the attributes

00:24:59.874 --> 00:25:02.730
of this solarity,
this continuous,

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.715
steady giving of oneself as the
sun does in the Neo-platonic

00:25:07.715 --> 00:25:10.452
imagery,
the mystical neo-Platonic

00:25:10.452 --> 00:25:12.660
imagery of the pseudo Dionysus.
 

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:17.778
A sun rose on the world as this
does sometimes from the Ganges.

00:25:17.778 --> 00:25:24.627
As soon as we--Dante has
mentioned the specific place for

00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:29.885
Francis' birth,
then the coordinates of--the

00:25:29.885 --> 00:25:35.390
geographic coordinates
completely change.

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:39.061
We go from the specific and
local to literally the global,

00:25:39.061 --> 00:25:42.540
the world of the Ganges,
the Orient, something a little

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.250
vaster.
 

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.673
As if the sun,
Francis really acts between the

00:25:47.673 --> 00:25:51.803
concrete and local,
and the widest possible

00:25:51.803 --> 00:25:53.180
reference.
 

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:57.538
"Therefore let him who
makes mention of that place not

00:25:57.538 --> 00:26:01.068
say Ascesi,"
which means I rise,

00:26:01.068 --> 00:26:04.732
but it's punning with Assisi,
"for he would say too

00:26:04.732 --> 00:26:07.221
little,
but Orient, if he would

00:26:07.221 --> 00:26:08.618
name it rightly."
 

00:26:08.618 --> 00:26:14.932
It's an extraordinary image and
two astronomical terms,

00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:19.259
the sun and the Orient for
Francis.

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:23.920
Francis appears as--not just as
the sun does,

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.220
as one who can--and I'm playing
with the text here a little bit

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.093
but not much--
one who orients us,

00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:36.291
one who is supposed to orient
and re-orient us is born in

00:26:36.291 --> 00:26:41.118
Assisi and yet disappears as if
it were the East.

00:26:41.118 --> 00:26:44.980
What were his--What Dante is
implying,

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:50.356
I think, is that for those who
go on the face of the earth and

00:26:50.356 --> 00:26:55.381
lose their ways then Francis
becomes one who can tell them

00:26:55.381 --> 00:27:00.230
how to find their way back
wherever they are going.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:04.250
For those who do not know their
way at all, have never known the

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.930
way, they are capable of
discovering it.

00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.891
He is providing this light,
so what is this light that he

00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:11.670
provides?
 

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:14.868
What kind of light does he
bring out?

00:27:14.868 --> 00:27:18.314
"He was not yet far from
his rising,"

00:27:18.314 --> 00:27:21.308
the metaphorics of the sun
continues,

00:27:21.308 --> 00:27:24.261
"when he began to make the
earth feel some strengthening

00:27:24.261 --> 00:27:28.609
from his mighty influence;
for," and now he gives the

00:27:28.609 --> 00:27:30.910
story of Francis' life.
 

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:36.118
Before I go there I just want
to tell you that Dante--

00:27:36.118 --> 00:27:41.038
and I brought a translation of
a poem that Dante knew that

00:27:41.038 --> 00:27:45.180
Francis is an extraordinary-- is
a great poet.

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:49.734
He's actually--we consider him
the first poet in Italian,

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:51.848
in the Italian language.
 

00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:56.007
I Just want to read a few
stanzas from the so called

00:27:56.007 --> 00:28:00.980
Canticle of Brother Sun
so that you can see how Dante's

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:05.953
own metaphorics derive straight
out of this Franciscan vision,

00:28:05.953 --> 00:28:08.400
Franciscan spirituality.
 

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.845
He begins, "Most
high," it's a prayer,

00:28:11.845 --> 00:28:15.950
a Canticle of Brother
Sun, "all powerful good

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:16.608
Lord!
 

00:28:16.608 --> 00:28:19.847
Yours are the praises,
the glory, the honor,

00:28:19.847 --> 00:28:21.278
and all blessing.
 

00:28:21.278 --> 00:28:25.836
To you alone most high do they
belong, and no man is worthy to

00:28:25.836 --> 00:28:27.328
mention your name.
 

00:28:27.328 --> 00:28:30.368
Praise be you my Lord with all
your creatures,

00:28:30.368 --> 00:28:35.076
especially Brother Sun who is
the day and through whom you

00:28:35.076 --> 00:28:38.476
give us light,
and it's beautiful and radiant

00:28:38.476 --> 00:28:42.670
with great splendor and bears a
likeness of you most High One.

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:46.240
Praise be you my Lord through
Sister Moon and the stars.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.397
In heaven you formed them clear
and precious and beautiful,

00:28:49.397 --> 00:28:52.230
praised be you my Lord through
Brother Wind."

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.981
He goes through all the four
elements and part of the

00:28:55.981 --> 00:29:00.240
suggestiveness of this poem is
that it's a song of praise to

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.973
God,
clearly enough,

00:29:01.973 --> 00:29:06.309
but it is also--we never know
if Francis is thinking of these

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:09.584
elements: the sun,
the moon, the wind,

00:29:09.584 --> 00:29:14.182
the water, death itself--
as the medium through whom he

00:29:14.182 --> 00:29:16.958
can praise,
or the cause on account of

00:29:16.958 --> 00:29:20.059
which he should praise,
or the other agents;

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:22.528
the Italian is very ambiguous.
 

00:29:22.528 --> 00:29:24.488
"Por,"
for those of you who may know a

00:29:24.488 --> 00:29:26.028
little French or a little
Spanish,

00:29:26.028 --> 00:29:30.075
for, by, through,
this is--so there's a kind of

00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:33.769
extraordinarily choir and
orchestration.

00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:36.951
The other thing that I should
mention is that finally we can

00:29:36.951 --> 00:29:39.971
understand the rhetoric of
praise that is running through

00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:43.356
this poem,
but we also saw as describing

00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:48.244
the rhetoric of praise in
Dante's Vita nuova when

00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:53.398
he finds out that the best way
of writing about Beatrice is

00:29:53.398 --> 00:29:57.855
really to write praise poems,
not actually--which he

00:29:57.855 --> 00:30:00.730
distinguishes from flattery but
praise poems,

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:07.346
the poems of praise means in
many ways rejecting all sense of

00:30:07.346 --> 00:30:08.670
ownership.
 

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.750
Realizing that not--the fact
that one may know,

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:17.673
the world doesn't mean that one
owns it and also it means that

00:30:17.673 --> 00:30:22.759
not knowing Beatrice is not just
a cover to wish to own her,

00:30:22.759 --> 00:30:27.133
so the praise is as
disinterested and as free a mode

00:30:27.133 --> 00:30:30.650
of acknowledgement of Beatrice
herself.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:36.273
Let's see how this continues,
this whole poetic vision of

00:30:36.273 --> 00:30:39.690
Francis continues with Canto XI.
 

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:44.645
Dante goes on giving us the
life of Francis and he catches

00:30:44.645 --> 00:30:48.523
Francis in what is--
in what I would call using the

00:30:48.523 --> 00:30:51.896
language of anthropology really,
a liminal stage.

00:30:51.896 --> 00:30:54.980
You know what I mean by the
liminal stage?

00:30:54.980 --> 00:31:00.019
The world liminal comes
from--it's the Latin threshold

00:31:00.019 --> 00:31:03.538
or comes from the Latin for
limit,

00:31:03.538 --> 00:31:05.759
there are two words,
in many ways very

00:31:05.759 --> 00:31:09.940
contradictory,
but it has the power liman is

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:15.316
one thing meaning threshold,
but also the word might also be

00:31:15.316 --> 00:31:18.258
limit,
so the threshold may be a limit

00:31:18.258 --> 00:31:22.589
and the threshold may also be an
opportunity to cross,

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:24.338
a way of going over.
 

00:31:24.338 --> 00:31:26.690
I call it--Dante doesn't use
here;

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:29.064
he does use the word limit
several times,

00:31:29.064 --> 00:31:30.368
not in this context.
 

00:31:30.368 --> 00:31:35.432
Dante places Francis in a
liminal position that is to say,

00:31:35.432 --> 00:31:39.338
between and betweest two
different orders.

00:31:39.338 --> 00:31:42.588
On the one hand the world,
and on the other hand,

00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:46.298
some kind of utopian idea that
we never--

00:31:46.298 --> 00:31:50.123
which would be the order that
he goes on to institute or some

00:31:50.123 --> 00:31:53.308
general vision about what the
world ought to be.

00:31:53.308 --> 00:31:57.703
He places Francis in between
neither part of the world,

00:31:57.703 --> 00:32:02.423
nor part of this final utopia
and let's see what he does in

00:32:02.423 --> 00:32:04.538
this liminal position.
 

00:32:04.538 --> 00:32:08.650
That's where he catches him and
look at these lines here,

00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:13.441
"Still a youth,"
this is the biography of

00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:19.287
Francis modeled on a number of
biographies that existed at the

00:32:19.287 --> 00:32:20.150
time.
 

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:24.038
"For still a youth he ran
into strife with his father,

00:32:24.038 --> 00:32:28.730
for a lady to whom as to death
not willingly unlocks the

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.250
door," which is an
extraordinarily difficult line

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.700
to translate.
 

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.280
The Italian really could be
read to say unlocks the door of

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.150
pleasure.
 

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:46.284
"And before his spiritual
court," and now he uses a

00:32:46.284 --> 00:32:49.781
Latin phrase,
which is a legal formula and

00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:52.108
has the value of a legal
formula,

00:32:52.108 --> 00:32:54.467
coram patre,
that is to say he marries this

00:32:54.467 --> 00:32:56.421
woman,
we don't know who she is yet,

00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:58.308
in the presence of his own
father,

00:32:58.308 --> 00:33:04.568
thus giving legitimacy to his
act, the act of marriage.

00:33:04.568 --> 00:33:08.472
"Coram patre he was
joined to her and thenceforth

00:33:08.472 --> 00:33:10.358
loved her better every day.
 

00:33:10.358 --> 00:33:13.035
She, bereft of her first
husband,"

00:33:13.035 --> 00:33:15.523
Christ,
"despised and obscure

00:33:15.523 --> 00:33:19.588
eleven hundred years and more,
remained without a suitor till

00:33:19.588 --> 00:33:22.645
he came;
nor did it avail when men heard

00:33:22.645 --> 00:33:27.076
that he who put all the world in
fear found her unmoved,

00:33:27.076 --> 00:33:30.538
with Amyclas,
at the sound of his voice;

00:33:30.538 --> 00:33:33.690
nor did it avail her to have
such courage and constancy that,

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.471
where Mary stayed below,
she mounted on the cross with

00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:37.048
Christ.
 

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:41.446
But, lest I proceed too darkly,
take now Francis and Poverty

00:33:41.446 --> 00:33:44.279
for these lovers in all I have
said.

00:33:44.279 --> 00:33:49.057
Their harmony and happy looks
moved men to love and wonder and

00:33:49.057 --> 00:33:53.210
sweet contemplation and led them
to holy thoughts,

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:56.061
so that the venerable Bernard
first went barefoot and ran

00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:59.582
after that great peace and,
running, thought himself too

00:33:59.582 --> 00:34:00.009
slow.
 

00:34:00.009 --> 00:34:02.930
Oh wealth unknown and fruitful
good!"

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.095
There is clearly a reversal,
Francis marries poverty,

00:34:06.095 --> 00:34:09.809
and yet to have that marriage
of Poverty we have to understand

00:34:09.809 --> 00:34:11.940
what--in a moment what that is.
 

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:16.043
A lot of wealth,
a lot of riches can be

00:34:16.043 --> 00:34:22.416
produced, a clear turning of
whatever intentions he may have

00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:27.599
had and the consequences of that
act of his.

00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.659
What is this representation of
Francis?

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:34.458
It's, I think,
in this liminal position,

00:34:34.458 --> 00:34:40.856
Francis is shown as he is
turning upside down all the

00:34:40.856 --> 00:34:45.409
values that the world holds
dear.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:50.699
He wants to marry nothing.
 

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:54.650
Poverty, to marry Poverty is to
marry nothing.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:57.768
You marry to be--you want
to--you yoked yourself,

00:34:57.768 --> 00:35:02.161
you embrace owning nothing,
but that marriage or that union

00:35:02.161 --> 00:35:06.099
appears as a sacramental act so
he is making fun,

00:35:06.099 --> 00:35:07.880
he is parodying marriage.
 

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.545
Just let me be a bit
more--because I don't want to

00:35:10.545 --> 00:35:14.148
imply at all any blasphemy here,
but he's parodying even the

00:35:14.148 --> 00:35:17.139
sacrament of marriage,
he is marrying nothing.

00:35:17.139 --> 00:35:21.690
It's not a legal person,
some age in Poverty,

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:25.018
it's just an idealization or an
allegory for nothing,

00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:27.760
but that is conducted,
that ceremony,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.440
is conducted as if it were a
sacramental act.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.766
Not only a sacramental act,
he's parodying the law,

00:35:33.766 --> 00:35:37.427
because he's marrying Poverty
in the presence of his own

00:35:37.427 --> 00:35:38.159
father.
 

00:35:38.159 --> 00:35:41.869
He undress--he divests himself
of all the clothes,

00:35:41.869 --> 00:35:44.898
which in the Middle Ages,
as much as now,

00:35:44.898 --> 00:35:48.760
always stands for some form of
symbolic status.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:52.159
The way you dress according to
the job you want,

00:35:52.159 --> 00:35:54.039
they usually say,
right?

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:58.739
That is to say--what I mean to
say is that dresses,

00:35:58.739 --> 00:36:04.192
clothes are part of a social
set of values which Francis is

00:36:04.192 --> 00:36:06.730
flouting and parodying.
 

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:10.331
We have--we are in the presence
of the parody of legal language,

00:36:10.331 --> 00:36:13.190
sacramental language,
even the language of love.

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:15.590
At one point,
the language of sexuality,

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.909
the idea of marrying Poverty
to--does not--

00:36:19.909 --> 00:36:24.130
I changed the translation of
the phrase the way Sinclair,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.110
because it's a little bit
torturous even in Italian,

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.518
the way Sinclair has it--he
says "none willingly

00:36:30.518 --> 00:36:34.056
unlocks the door,"
that unwillingly is the door of

00:36:34.056 --> 00:36:34.909
pleasure.
 

00:36:34.909 --> 00:36:37.768
Even sexuality,
which is certainly a value of

00:36:37.768 --> 00:36:40.239
the world, Francis will turn
around.

00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:44.699
This is a radical critique of
the value system of the world.

00:36:44.699 --> 00:36:50.733
Call it a prophetic mode of
abandoning the idols of the

00:36:50.733 --> 00:36:57.436
world in favor of some kind of
utopia or unexpected or really

00:36:57.436 --> 00:37:02.298
not clarified,
not very well described vision

00:37:02.298 --> 00:37:06.632
of how the world ought to be,
but this is--he rejects all of

00:37:06.632 --> 00:37:08.487
this so "She,
bereft of her first

00:37:08.487 --> 00:37:10.516
husband"--
"coram patre he was

00:37:10.516 --> 00:37:11.932
joined to her,
and thenceforth loved her

00:37:11.932 --> 00:37:12.659
better every day.
 

00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:16.509
She, bereft of her first
husband, despised and obscure

00:37:16.509 --> 00:37:20.867
eleven hundred years and more,
remained without a suitor till

00:37:20.867 --> 00:37:23.574
he came;
nor did it avail when men heard

00:37:23.574 --> 00:37:26.833
that he who put all the world in
fear found her unmoved,

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:29.380
with Amyclas,
at the sound of his voice;

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.860
nor did it avail her to have
such courage and constancy that,

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:35.969
where Mary stayed below,
she," Poverty,

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:39.090
"mounted on the cross with
Christ."

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.849
She does something even better
than what Mary does,

00:37:42.849 --> 00:37:45.530
"But lest I proceed too
darkly,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.077
take now Francis and Poverty
for these lovers in all I have

00:37:48.077 --> 00:37:48.650
said."
 

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:54.144
"Their harmony and happy
looks," this is another

00:37:54.144 --> 00:37:59.737
parody of the language of the
amorous discourse of medieval

00:37:59.737 --> 00:38:01.280
love poetry.
 

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:07.809
They go on--he just--it's a
dalliance with nothing,

00:38:07.809 --> 00:38:12.233
so they have now finally an
inclusion of an extraordinary

00:38:12.233 --> 00:38:15.710
non-value because that's what
poverty is,

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:20.878
something that questions all
values and it's a Franciscan

00:38:20.878 --> 00:38:22.539
idea of poverty.
 

00:38:22.539 --> 00:38:23.909
What do they mean by that?
 

00:38:23.909 --> 00:38:26.637
What did Francis mean by this,
by this idea of poverty,

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:27.800
what is this poverty?
 

00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:31.969
First of all,
you know that this subject

00:38:31.969 --> 00:38:38.170
became part of an extensive
iconographic representation.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:42.360
One can think of the Giotto
frescos, the cycles of,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:46.717
Franciscan cycles in Assisi,
but all over Tuscany and

00:38:46.717 --> 00:38:47.639
Umbria.
 

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:51.668
It's not only unique to Dante's
understanding,

00:38:51.668 --> 00:38:56.054
and Dante's insight,
it's a sort of representation

00:38:56.054 --> 00:38:59.010
and fascination with Francis.
 

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.849
Another little detail that I
should tell you is that Francis,

00:39:01.849 --> 00:39:06.018
in Italian, is Franciscos,
meaning that he is French,

00:39:06.018 --> 00:39:10.250
and there was the--like
Francesca, the other Francesca,

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.920
the other one who also
understood a lot about love,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.110
but lost her way in Canto V.
 

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:19.179
It really means free,
the word in English,

00:39:19.179 --> 00:39:21.179
you have the word
"frank"

00:39:21.179 --> 00:39:24.827
which in many ways carries over
the resonance of the Latin word

00:39:24.827 --> 00:39:25.710
Franciscos.
 

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:29.931
Francis, true to his name,
is now as being poor is

00:39:29.931 --> 00:39:34.239
absolutely free,
there's no bondage to anything.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:38.364
There's nothing that holds him
to anything in the world,

00:39:38.364 --> 00:39:42.565
so this is one important,
let's call it ethical extension

00:39:42.565 --> 00:39:43.690
of poverty.
 

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:45.159
What did they mean?
 

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:47.739
What did the other Franciscans,
like Bonaventure,

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:51.547
who was there listening to what
Aquinas may say about the

00:39:51.547 --> 00:39:54.668
founder of his order,
what did they understand by

00:39:54.668 --> 00:39:55.000
that?
 

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.581
Remember we talked about--Dante
certainly seems to have stressed

00:39:59.581 --> 00:40:03.291
the idea of poverty being
poverty in a very material

00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:05.909
bodily way, corporeal,
physical.

00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:08.072
In this sense,
I call it prophetic in the

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.820
sense that,
as you know,

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:14.938
what distinguishes the biblical
prophets from other prophets is

00:40:14.938 --> 00:40:19.972
that they usually choose to bear
on their flesh the signs that

00:40:19.972 --> 00:40:22.780
they utter against the world.
 

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:29.891
If they want to speak about
this infidelity of Israel they

00:40:29.891 --> 00:40:33.260
would marry a prostitute.
 

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:38.070
If they want to denounce the
dissidence,

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.932
heresies, and lacerations
within the body politic of

00:40:41.932 --> 00:40:46.402
Israel they would even go on
cutting off an arm of theirs to

00:40:46.402 --> 00:40:49.510
dramatize on the flesh this idea
of--

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:53.599
these prophetic pronouncements
that we're making.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:57.329
This is part of what Francis
then is doing here,

00:40:57.329 --> 00:41:00.733
and this idea that he's
living--Poverty it's not just an

00:41:00.733 --> 00:41:03.518
allegory as an allegorical
representation,

00:41:03.518 --> 00:41:05.610
it is something lived in the
flesh;

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:09.451
the literal and the allegorical
are now compressed,

00:41:09.451 --> 00:41:12.293
but there's more,
what did--what does,

00:41:12.293 --> 00:41:15.213
for instance,
Bonaventure think of what

00:41:15.213 --> 00:41:16.518
poverty is?
 

00:41:16.518 --> 00:41:19.387
Dante, I repeat,
thinks about the material idea

00:41:19.387 --> 00:41:22.817
of poverty,
so a way of opposing avarice,

00:41:22.817 --> 00:41:28.829
a way of opposing prodigality,
attachment or contempt for the

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:29.679
values.
 

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:33.159
We have seen all of that
before, but poverty to them also

00:41:33.159 --> 00:41:34.900
means poverty of language.
 

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:40.135
Francis, the first one to--I've
articulated, even that poem of

00:41:40.135 --> 00:41:43.364
his;
repetitive, the same simple

00:41:43.364 --> 00:41:48.179
formulaic expressions,
praise be omnipotent it said,

00:41:48.179 --> 00:41:51.992
Oh Lord it said,
repeated, it's a poverty of

00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.983
language,
the poverty of our thoughts,

00:41:54.983 --> 00:41:58.849
that which Dante at the
beginning of Canto XI has been

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:01.550
calling the
"defective."

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:07.480
Remember that is the word that
I did not stress when we were,

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:12.224
"insensate care of
mortals, how vain are the

00:42:12.224 --> 00:42:14.300
reasonings."
 

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.731
How "defective"
the Italian original says how

00:42:17.731 --> 00:42:21.099
"defective,"
I hope some translators pick up

00:42:21.099 --> 00:42:24.275
"defective"
and make it and say that it's

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:27.199
"defective"
in the idea that they are

00:42:27.199 --> 00:42:30.809
lacking,
that they have nothing of their

00:42:30.809 --> 00:42:33.052
own,
so that retrospectively you can

00:42:33.052 --> 00:42:36.164
understand what I'm talking
about that we cannot own the

00:42:36.164 --> 00:42:40.266
world,
that this--the world is a world

00:42:40.266 --> 00:42:45.385
of gifts that the economies--
an economy of giving,

00:42:45.385 --> 00:42:48.231
constant giving,
because the more you give and

00:42:48.231 --> 00:42:52.264
the less you have of yourself,
the more you are free and the

00:42:52.264 --> 00:42:57.342
more productive your own acts
can become as were the case of

00:42:57.342 --> 00:42:58.289
Francis.
 

00:42:58.289 --> 00:43:03.324
This is not all that Dante will
do with Francis this is

00:43:03.324 --> 00:43:07.800
now--there is one little
reference that I want to

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.920
mention.
 

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:18.909
This is around lines 102 or so,
Francis will go on trying to

00:43:18.909 --> 00:43:24.731
have this--
to receive a seal of approval

00:43:24.731 --> 00:43:29.480
from the popes about the
fraternity,

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.829
the order, the confraternity,
whatever--

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:35.081
that he organized "When
the company of Poor Brothers

00:43:35.081 --> 00:43:38.333
increased behind him whose
wondrous life were better sung

00:43:38.333 --> 00:43:41.461
in heaven's glory,
the holy purpose of this chief

00:43:41.461 --> 00:43:44.807
shepherd was encircled with a
second crown by the Eternal

00:43:44.807 --> 00:43:46.780
Spirit through Honorius."
 

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:51.041
Honorius agrees--the Pope
Honorius agrees to recognize

00:43:51.041 --> 00:43:52.409
this new order.
 

00:43:52.409 --> 00:43:55.889
Now listen to this,
that's really the point that I

00:43:55.889 --> 00:43:58.018
want to stop on for a while.
 

00:43:58.018 --> 00:44:00.960
"And when in thirst for
martyrdom,

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.032
he had preached Christ and them
that followed Him in the proud

00:44:05.032 --> 00:44:08.570
presence of the Sultan,
and, finding the people unripe

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:11.690
for conversion and not being
willing to remain for no

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:14.465
purpose,
he had returned to the harvest

00:44:14.465 --> 00:44:18.840
of the Italian fields,
then, on the rough crag between

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.641
Tiber and Arno,
he received from Christ the

00:44:21.641 --> 00:44:24.228
last seal,
which his members bore for two

00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.099
years."
 

00:44:25.099 --> 00:44:28.456
He's alluding to the famous
story of the stigmata that

00:44:28.456 --> 00:44:32.739
Francis received;
the body becomes a sign.

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:38.981
What I was trying to explain
with the reference to the Hebrew

00:44:38.981 --> 00:44:44.945
prophets who dramatize their--
and legitimize the validity of

00:44:44.945 --> 00:44:50.480
the message by an inscription of
that message on the literal--

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:54.940
the physicality of their own
flesh and it's-- let's leave at

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:55.469
that.
 

00:44:55.469 --> 00:44:58.099
The point though,
that Dante is making,

00:44:58.099 --> 00:45:01.150
this is the story of the
stigmata, but it's also the

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:04.739
story of Francis who tries to go
and preach to the Sultan.

00:45:04.739 --> 00:45:10.393
He fails on having the
theological argument and the

00:45:10.393 --> 00:45:16.838
two--the Sultan and Francis
depart, each along his way--on

00:45:16.838 --> 00:45:19.780
his way and that's it.
 

00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:24.632
It's a story of--that can be
understood apparently as a

00:45:24.632 --> 00:45:27.329
failure of Francis' message.
 

00:45:27.329 --> 00:45:31.210
At the same time,
it is an extraordinary

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:37.380
hermeneutical term that has
taken place in Dante's thinking.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.621
We have had,
and we will have,

00:45:39.621 --> 00:45:42.018
celebrations of the crusades.
 

00:45:42.018 --> 00:45:47.306
Now we have a story of an
encounter between Christians and

00:45:47.306 --> 00:45:51.110
Muslims in terms of peaceful
language,

00:45:51.110 --> 00:45:54.780
peaceful speech,
where the two exponents,

00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.762
or--two of the exponents of the
particular beliefs can come

00:45:57.762 --> 00:46:01.159
together and encounter,
and they can discuss.

00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:04.132
The Sultan says no,
for him we are not ripe,

00:46:04.132 --> 00:46:08.003
and for--the Sultan probably
says, well I don't think you

00:46:08.003 --> 00:46:11.530
know what you are talking about
and they leave.

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:17.400
This is an extraordinary change
in the dissemination of violence

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:22.900
that had been at the center of
so much theological discourse

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:28.213
and here Dante seems to be
opting and following Francis on

00:46:28.213 --> 00:46:30.449
a different route.
 

00:46:30.449 --> 00:46:33.875
This is, I think,
an important change in the

00:46:33.875 --> 00:46:36.793
consciousness,
the historic understanding of

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:39.815
the relationship between
Christians and Muslims and their

00:46:39.815 --> 00:46:41.650
interpretations of the crusade.
 

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:45.250
There is a further detail that
I want to mention here.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:53.650
The detail is this detail about
two geographic coordinates in

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:55.469
this canto.
 

00:46:55.469 --> 00:47:01.005
Now we have just read about
Francis' trip to Egypt and the

00:47:01.005 --> 00:47:01.880
Sultan.
 

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:09.452
A little earlier Dante gives
the--refers to the birthplace of

00:47:09.452 --> 00:47:14.250
Francis by talking about the
Ganges.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:20.556
In other words Dante has--is
aware that there is a European

00:47:20.556 --> 00:47:27.079
world that we talked about last
time, but there are two other

00:47:27.079 --> 00:47:28.820
coordinates.
 

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.217
One, a Hindu world of the
Ganges and we shall see what the

00:47:32.217 --> 00:47:34.898
means for him,
and the other one is the Muslim

00:47:34.898 --> 00:47:36.329
world of the Sultan.
 

00:47:36.329 --> 00:47:40.628
He's acknowledging in many ways
that which is--we probably may

00:47:40.628 --> 00:47:43.800
not be entirely familiar with
this problem.

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.360
He's acknowledging that which
the--someone like Bonaventure

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.090
had been discussing.
 

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:54.434
In 1273, Bonaventure,
the man that we shall see in

00:47:54.434 --> 00:47:57.429
the next canto,
traveled to Paris to give a

00:47:57.429 --> 00:47:59.920
number of lectures at the
University of Paris,

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:05.608
he will die a year later in
1274, and they are called

00:48:05.608 --> 00:48:07.139
Conferences.
 

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:10.751
A number of conferences in
which he just debates the

00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:14.646
question of the relationship
between what he calls these

00:48:14.646 --> 00:48:16.559
three cultures:
Hindu,

00:48:16.559 --> 00:48:19.563
the Christian,
and the Muslim,

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:25.159
and tries to see in what way
they can be harmonized.

00:48:25.159 --> 00:48:28.282
He connects,
it's Bonaventure,

00:48:28.282 --> 00:48:33.130
connects the Hindu religion
with joachism,

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:36.340
in the sense that the Joachim
of the third age,

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.592
not complicated at all,
you remember that Joachim has

00:48:39.592 --> 00:48:42.659
this paradigm of history
according to a tripartite

00:48:42.659 --> 00:48:45.224
structure: the age of the
Father, the Son,

00:48:45.224 --> 00:48:46.539
and the Spirit.
 

00:48:46.539 --> 00:48:48.590
The third age,
which is his own age,

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:51.309
the age when Bonaventure lives,
when Dante lives,

00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:57.264
is the age of the Spirit
implies the elimination of all

00:48:57.264 --> 00:48:58.920
institutions.
 

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.742
The idea that the Spirit now is
everywhere and there is no need

00:49:03.742 --> 00:49:06.309
for any hierarchy or any order.
 

00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:11.650
Bonaventure says this is
exactly the world of the Hindus

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.340
who believe that God is
everywhere,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:18.260
and then he goes on talking
about he,

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.759
Bonaventure,
talks about the Muslims for

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:26.784
whose theologies are a theology
of an impassable distance

00:49:26.784 --> 00:49:30.329
between God--
a transcendence that nothing

00:49:30.329 --> 00:49:34.661
can really bridge between a God
who remains invisible and the

00:49:34.661 --> 00:49:36.610
world of every man here.
 

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:40.045
Of course for him,
the mediation between the two

00:49:40.045 --> 00:49:43.920
is given by Christianity because
with the idea of--

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.105
there is a transcendence and at
the same time an imminence of

00:49:47.105 --> 00:49:48.909
God in the transcendence of God.
 

00:49:48.909 --> 00:49:53.670
Dante is, I think,
echoing this text and these

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:57.480
problems in the canto of
Francis,

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.489
so he places Francis between
the Ganges and Egypt,

00:50:01.489 --> 00:50:06.630
and places him as the one who
is carving a new space,

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:10.329
the space that he calls that of
poverty meaning freedom,

00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:13.813
meaning the will,
meaning the way of love as a

00:50:13.813 --> 00:50:16.909
way of coming to the knowledge
of God.

00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:22.887
Then I would like to move on
to, very briefly,

00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:24.880
to Canto XII.
 

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:31.056
Briefly, not because I am
not--I'm insensitive to what

00:50:31.056 --> 00:50:36.070
Dante will do with Dominic in
Canto XII,

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:39.797
we really haven't got time,
but I want to mention to you a

00:50:39.797 --> 00:50:41.039
number of things.
 

00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:47.152
How the encounter with
Bonaventure--I'm sorry the

00:50:47.152 --> 00:50:54.793
encounter with the description
of Dominic told by Bonaventure

00:50:54.793 --> 00:50:59.760
really rewrites the previous
canto.

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:06.534
There, in the previous canto of
Francis where the marriage,

00:51:06.534 --> 00:51:13.659
parodic, kind of anarchic idea
of the valuelessness of all the

00:51:13.659 --> 00:51:15.880
worldly values.
 

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:20.971
Here now, we have a different
wedding, a different marriage

00:51:20.971 --> 00:51:26.364
between Dominic and faith;
between knowledge and theology

00:51:26.364 --> 00:51:32.139
if you want to put it at a very
generic and general level.

00:51:32.139 --> 00:51:38.909
Here too, there is the--let me
just go over with lines 45,

00:51:38.909 --> 00:51:42.726
"In that part,"
that's the description of the

00:51:42.726 --> 00:51:45.583
legend of Dominic,
the life of Dominic,

00:51:45.583 --> 00:51:49.568
"In that part where sweet
Zephyr rises to open the new

00:51:49.568 --> 00:51:53.760
leaves in which Europe,"
once again see how Dante's--

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:58.210
there is a kind of continental
imagination here,

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:01.362
the Asia, Africa,
and Europe, the three

00:52:01.362 --> 00:52:06.010
continents "in which Europe
sees herself reclad,

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:11.480
not far from the beating of the
waves behind which the sun,

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.405
after his long flight,
sometimes hides himself from

00:52:14.405 --> 00:52:17.300
all men,
lies favoured Calahorra."

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:21.889
You'll love this detail;
I know that--I can tell by the

00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:26.730
way the eyes of some of you
smile when I point this thing.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:32.096
Dante is talking about the
birthplace of Dominic and places

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:37.369
that--which is where it was,
in the western part of Spain,

00:52:37.369 --> 00:52:39.960
there were the sun sets.
 

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.300
Dominic becomes the counter to
Francis;

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:48.057
he was born where the sun rises
and now Dominic is within where

00:52:48.057 --> 00:52:49.210
the sun sets.
 

00:52:49.210 --> 00:52:52.869
So between the two of them the
whole movement of the sun,

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:55.699
the translatio,
the translation of faith,

00:52:55.699 --> 00:52:59.070
not the translation of empires,
not the translation of culture,

00:52:59.070 --> 00:53:02.626
the translation of faith seems
to be encompassed between the

00:53:02.626 --> 00:53:03.469
two of them.
 

00:53:03.469 --> 00:53:07.130
That which will make you smile
is that Dante mentions,

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:11.349
and you can check,
Francis' birth in the East

00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:15.760
where the sun rises at line 50
of Canto XI,

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:22.568
and he mentions the setting sun
of Dominic in line 52 of Canto

00:53:22.568 --> 00:53:26.536
XII,
as if there is a kind of--this

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:31.273
is a kind of little touch,
I think it's--I find it a very

00:53:31.273 --> 00:53:32.920
amusing touch between them.
 

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:39.159
To account for the difference
in proximity between the two,

00:53:39.159 --> 00:53:41.340
as if this movement also has a
kind of--

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:45.434
the movement of the sun from
east to west on account of them

00:53:45.434 --> 00:53:48.210
has its own quickness,
its own rhythm.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:53.701
"In it was born the loving
liegeman of the Christian faith,

00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:57.188
the holy athlete,
gracious to his own and

00:53:57.188 --> 00:54:00.018
pitiless to enemies;
and his mind,

00:54:00.018 --> 00:54:03.030
as soon as it was created,
was so full of living power

00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:05.929
that in his mother's womb it
made her prophetic.

00:54:05.929 --> 00:54:09.795
When the espousals between him
and the faith were completed at

00:54:09.795 --> 00:54:12.963
the holy font,"
here there is another marriage

00:54:12.963 --> 00:54:16.449
ceremony that counters the
previous marriage ceremony of

00:54:16.449 --> 00:54:17.400
Canto XI.
 

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:23.521
I want to draw your attention
to the use of these playful

00:54:23.521 --> 00:54:28.550
images, the athletes of faith,
the liegemen.

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.963
In the previous canto,
we had Francis,

00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:36.670
who I said, parodies all the
values of the world.

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:42.579
He is called--and that has
really become a formula to

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:46.496
describe both Francis--
unless Dominic though,

00:54:46.496 --> 00:54:49.137
they are the so-called--
I'll give it to you in Latin

00:54:49.137 --> 00:54:50.050
and translate it.
 

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:53.527
In English we would call them
the "clowns of the

00:54:53.527 --> 00:54:55.869
lord,"
lociulatories;

00:54:55.869 --> 00:54:59.079
they are the clowns,
lociulatories domini.

00:54:59.079 --> 00:55:04.266
The "clowns of the
Lord," that is to say they

00:55:04.266 --> 00:55:08.590
are playing, they are playing at
the world;

00:55:08.590 --> 00:55:09.989
they play with the world.
 

00:55:09.989 --> 00:55:15.474
They bring in what we would
call a perspective of play in

00:55:15.474 --> 00:55:16.650
the world.
 

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:20.056
They are making fun of the
world, they are challenging the

00:55:20.056 --> 00:55:23.762
values of the world and in this
sense they bring out that which

00:55:23.762 --> 00:55:27.230
becomes the most impressive
aspect of their theology,

00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.690
which is that of a playful
theology.

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:30.829
We'll talk more about this.
 

00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:35.650
The notion that God plays,
that creation itself is a

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.630
spectacle,
I call it a

00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:41.050
"theodrama,"
the idea that God is not--

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:45.672
it doesn't deprive the Divinity
of its seriousness but makes

00:55:45.672 --> 00:55:49.119
that seriousness part of the
world of joy.

00:55:49.119 --> 00:55:52.784
That's the whole--the
aesthetics, the new aesthetics

00:55:52.784 --> 00:55:57.117
that Francis manages to release,
and Dominic manages also to

00:55:57.117 --> 00:56:00.001
release,
this kind of playful idea of

00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:01.659
the world, a comedy.
 

00:56:01.659 --> 00:56:05.711
I tried to explain to you from
the very first day when we got

00:56:05.711 --> 00:56:08.550
together how complicated it was
for me,

00:56:08.550 --> 00:56:10.896
at the time,
to explain why Dante calls his

00:56:10.896 --> 00:56:13.300
text a comedy because this is so
sublime.

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:17.007
It seems to be--he's talking
about how the ordinary and plain

00:56:17.007 --> 00:56:19.295
man of the year,
around the year 1300,

00:56:19.295 --> 00:56:22.510
manages to have the most
sublime of experiences.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:25.516
And this idea--of course this
is about the happy ending

00:56:25.516 --> 00:56:28.690
because comedies are always the
genre of happy endings.

00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:31.630
It is about the low level of
experiences,

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:33.900
about the vulgar language that
Dante uses,

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.617
but the real and substantial
reason for Dante calling his

00:56:38.617 --> 00:56:42.773
poem a comedy,
and for the readers using the

00:56:42.773 --> 00:56:46.750
attribute of divine,
was exactly--is exactly that;

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:53.271
a way of responding to this
sense of the joyful quality of

00:56:53.271 --> 00:56:56.590
creation, that's the point.
 

00:56:56.590 --> 00:56:59.266
For all the seriousness--for
all the horror that we have been

00:56:59.266 --> 00:57:01.409
witnessing through Hell and
Purgatory,

00:57:01.409 --> 00:57:06.018
joy seems to be,
that we're told which Dante is

00:57:06.018 --> 00:57:06.920
moving.
 

00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.179
Not a tragic vision because
once you play of--

00:57:09.179 --> 00:57:12.746
once you think of play you can
no longer have the tragic vision

00:57:12.746 --> 00:57:15.911
because you understand that the
tragic vision is part of

00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:17.119
something larger.
 

00:57:17.119 --> 00:57:21.530
It is part--it is vicissitudes,
comedies,

00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:24.262
and tragedies,
elegies are all linked to the

00:57:24.262 --> 00:57:27.059
wheel of fortune in medieval
iconography,

00:57:27.059 --> 00:57:29.932
so you keep going around but
they're all part of something

00:57:29.932 --> 00:57:33.527
really larger,
which is this playful theology,

00:57:33.527 --> 00:57:38.829
this theologia ludic
that he has been encompassing,

00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:41.018
that he has been preparing for
us.

00:57:41.018 --> 00:57:51.570
Let me just go on with a few
more details here,

00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:56.050
a couple of minutes and
then--this relationship now of--

00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:02.429
the other issue that really and
retrospectively,

00:58:02.429 --> 00:58:04.440
the other issue that Dante is
raising,

00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.780
let me just talk about this.
 

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:11.449
In the canto of Dominic,
much more than he did in the

00:58:11.449 --> 00:58:16.030
canto of Francis,
this is really a unique moment.

00:58:16.030 --> 00:58:19.449
It is a representation in terms
of language.

00:58:19.449 --> 00:58:24.123
It is as if whatever orthodoxy
Dominic stands for,

00:58:24.123 --> 00:58:29.179
because that's why the
Dominicans--the Dominicans were

00:58:29.179 --> 00:58:32.900
the intellectual arm of the
Church;

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.050
they were, as I said,
founded with a specific purpose

00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:42.001
of entering the universities and
debating the various points of

00:58:42.001 --> 00:58:42.719
view.
 

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:46.451
They were the Aristotelians,
they were the poets,

00:58:46.451 --> 00:58:50.960
they were traditionally the
troublemakers of--they were the

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.070
figures, the philosophers and so
on;

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:58.559
especially in Paris,
that's the university.

00:58:58.559 --> 00:59:02.842
There was a--there is an idea
of orthodoxy with Dominic and

00:59:02.842 --> 00:59:06.385
yet, here the whole
representation takes place in

00:59:06.385 --> 00:59:08.010
terms of language.
 

00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:11.969
Let me give you a couple of
examples around lines 80,

00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:15.875
"Many a time his nurse
found him silent and awake on

00:59:15.875 --> 00:59:18.454
the ground,"
this is part of this

00:59:18.454 --> 00:59:22.119
lodatio,
this encomium now of Dominic,

00:59:22.119 --> 00:59:25.409
"as if he said 'For this
am I come'.

00:59:25.409 --> 00:59:28.577
O father of him,
Felice,"

00:59:28.577 --> 00:59:30.980
Felix, "indeed!
 

00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.804
O mother of him,
Giovanna indeed,

00:59:33.804 --> 00:59:38.039
if, interpreted,
it means what they say!"

00:59:38.039 --> 00:59:40.529
Dante is playing with
etymologies here,

00:59:40.529 --> 00:59:44.900
the father is really happy;
there is a relationship between

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:47.449
the name and his state of mind.
 

00:59:47.449 --> 00:59:51.210
And the mother is,
meaning the one who is full of

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.503
grace Giovanna,
the one who comes before is

00:59:54.503 --> 00:59:57.559
also, if you interpret it
properly.

00:59:57.559 --> 01:00:02.552
That is to say,
orthodoxy or heresy,

01:00:02.552 --> 01:00:06.690
being its flip side,
right?

01:00:06.690 --> 01:00:09.829
Heresy and orthodoxy;
we could have been talking

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:13.115
about Siger of Brabant's heresy,
we've been talking about

01:00:13.115 --> 01:00:16.706
Joachim's heresy,
here appears as a question of

01:00:16.706 --> 01:00:20.081
language,
as a question of an order that

01:00:20.081 --> 01:00:22.789
is above all a grammatical
order,

01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:26.027
and therefore,
it means a kind of correction

01:00:26.027 --> 01:00:30.018
or has a kind of ambiguity that
you always assume,

01:00:30.018 --> 01:00:33.215
and you always presume,
to be present within the order

01:00:33.215 --> 01:00:34.059
of language.
 

01:00:34.059 --> 01:00:37.114
Anything, in fact
retrospectively I can say to

01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:39.219
you,
that even the schisms of

01:00:39.219 --> 01:00:43.090
Inferno, where we saw the
poet Bertrand de Born,

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:48.141
you remember that horrifying
picture of the poet who holds in

01:00:48.141 --> 01:00:53.110
his own hand like a lamp his own
head and goes on talking to

01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:54.880
Virgil and Dante.
 

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.083
Or, in that same canto,
there was the presence of

01:00:58.083 --> 01:01:01.820
Mohammed whose body seemed to be
completely lacerated.

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:05.230
Even the schisms are questions
of language, are

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:09.530
questions--Dante understands
them as issues of language.

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:11.690
Which does not--which only
means this,

01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:15.148
to talk about language,
I repeat, they are part of the

01:01:15.148 --> 01:01:17.500
imponderable quality of
language,

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.519
the ambiguities of language,
the force of language,

01:01:20.519 --> 01:01:22.440
and the power of language.
 

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:27.809
That's what I can tell you
about these cantos;

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:39.300
and let me stop here and see if
there are questions that I would

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:47.690
most gladly hear,
if not answer but--please.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:52.474
Student:  Would Dante
have faced any threat from the

01:01:52.474 --> 01:01:57.260
Church for placing Joachim in
Paradise as someone who--

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:02.130
Prof: The question is
would Dante have faced some

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:06.266
censorship,
probably, from the Church

01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:11.480
authorities for placing Joachim
in Paradise?

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:15.532
Actually no,
not at all, because the formula

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:19.545
he uses--
here comes the Calabrian Abbot

01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:24.900
Joachim endowed with the gift of
prophecy more or less,

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:27.480
that's the translation.
 

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.577
It translates a Latin formula,
the spiritu

01:02:30.577 --> 01:02:34.320
prophetico totato,
which was already used.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.422
He had been--Joachim had
already been exempted of the

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:44.820
censure of his thoughts that
Bonaventure had voiced,

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.931
and in the mass,
in honor of Joachim they would

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.630
use that formula.
 

01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:54.719
So he's actually using a
canonical formula,

01:02:54.719 --> 01:02:58.610
a church formula for his own,
for Joachim's own--

01:02:58.610 --> 01:03:00.536
never happened,
he's not a saint,

01:03:00.536 --> 01:03:03.490
never was a saint,
but what Dante probably--that's

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:05.619
what he did is he should be
canonized.

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:13.715
No, but the answer is--;and
that's the reason why he could

01:03:13.715 --> 01:03:18.260
not have faced any reprimands.
 

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:19.380
Yes.
 

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:22.824
Student:  You were
talking about--with St.

01:03:22.824 --> 01:03:25.550
Francis and sort of how Poverty
and St.

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:27.920
Francis as a form of freedom.
 

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.570
When he weds freedom he's--or
sorry,

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.719
when he weds Poverty he becomes
more free,

01:03:33.719 --> 01:03:37.199
can we link that to--or how can
we link that,

01:03:37.199 --> 01:03:40.010
is my question,
to Dante's--his own poverty and

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:41.929
exile;
is that meant to be linked?

01:03:41.929 --> 01:03:46.387
Are we supposed to be thinking
about Dante having to depend on,

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:48.760
I guess, the charity of others?
 

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.518
Prof: Good question,
the question is,

01:03:52.518 --> 01:03:57.853
I was talking about Poverty as
being a state of freedom in the

01:03:57.853 --> 01:03:59.690
canto of Francis.
 

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:05.155
Are we supposed to also
associate Dante's own fate of

01:04:05.155 --> 01:04:10.938
poor, exile, beggar that he was
during his exile in that

01:04:10.938 --> 01:04:12.619
description.
 

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:14.110
That's the question.
 

01:04:14.110 --> 01:04:18.634
I would say yes,
of course, the--Poverty I hope

01:04:18.634 --> 01:04:23.059
I explained means several things
for Dante.

01:04:23.059 --> 01:04:25.500
Bonaventure will go on thinking
about poverty of language,

01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:28.396
poverty of philosophy,
etc., but all of them

01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:31.360
understand poverty in a very
literal way,

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.650
but all of them understand one
thing that this kind of poverty

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:38.050
is really a description of the
human condition to begin with.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:41.750
We are all poor,
that's the primary sense.

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:46.369
We are all born defective and
in need,

01:04:46.369 --> 01:04:49.989
whatever needs were,
some of us go on being needy,

01:04:49.989 --> 01:04:53.496
and we are, all our lives,
so this is a general

01:04:53.496 --> 01:04:56.469
understanding of the idea of
poverty.

01:04:56.469 --> 01:04:59.606
Then there is a sort of--the
other side of this,

01:04:59.606 --> 01:05:03.811
and the other side is that it's
actually a blessing because it's

01:05:03.811 --> 01:05:05.480
the state of freedom.
 

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:08.911
If this is really very much
like what you expect to the

01:05:08.911 --> 01:05:12.280
philosophical freedom,
you know, without any cares.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:15.898
Even Horace--I don't want to
have wealth and it's not

01:05:15.898 --> 01:05:20.072
worrying about having the cares
about how the stock market is

01:05:20.072 --> 01:05:23.891
doing today or not doing,
so I want to be completely free

01:05:23.891 --> 01:05:25.960
of that and it's a state of
freedom.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:29.199
Is Dante also thinking about
himself?

01:05:29.199 --> 01:05:33.775
Does it have a consolatory note
for him to believe that after

01:05:33.775 --> 01:05:35.300
all I'm not alone?
 

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.300
Yes, I would say that that's
the case.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:43.416
In his own life Dante,
unlike Petrarch who really

01:05:43.416 --> 01:05:46.295
died--
a poet who follows a few years

01:05:46.295 --> 01:05:48.960
after Dante,
he really died one of the

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:52.750
wealthiest men of his time by
virtue of being a poet,

01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:56.579
a writer, and so on,
Dante never got to that point.

01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:59.309
Student:  I mean,
I'm wondering if we should take

01:05:59.309 --> 01:06:02.483
it literally as sort of feelings
about Poverty or is it more like

01:06:02.483 --> 01:06:05.262
an idea like a sort of poetic
escape into a perspective I

01:06:05.262 --> 01:06:08.289
guess that he had gotten in the
perspective of Poverty.

01:06:08.289 --> 01:06:13.469
Prof: Should we take it
literally or just as a poetic

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.050
way of speaking?
 

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:18.038
I think that I answered that by
saying--but I think you're

01:06:18.038 --> 01:06:21.130
asking something else maybe,
and then I'll get to that since

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:21.760
you are.
 

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.860
I think I'm saying that this
was really the reality of his

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:28.610
life.
 

01:06:28.610 --> 01:06:32.409
A stand such as that is bound
to appear maybe,

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:34.347
well, you know,
you need a little bit of

01:06:34.347 --> 01:06:38.117
comfort and consolation,
and so you say it's a poverty

01:06:38.117 --> 01:06:42.719
but it really has the chrism of
Francis' spirituality.

01:06:42.719 --> 01:06:45.940
I'm not trying to diminish
Dante's convictions.

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.130
What I think you're really
asking is,

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:49.960
I don't know you're really
asking, I don't know,

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.121
but I know what you are
asking--but there is another

01:06:53.121 --> 01:06:54.610
side to your question.
 

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.974
Are you asking me whether or
not he was a Franciscan,

01:06:56.974 --> 01:06:58.929
for instance,
is that what you're asking?

01:06:58.929 --> 01:07:03.469
Because if you are that would
be a very good question in the

01:07:03.469 --> 01:07:06.469
sense that there were a lot of
ideas.

01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:09.518
We don't have any evidence,
but a lot of ideas that he

01:07:09.518 --> 01:07:12.800
became a member of the third
order of the Franciscans,

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.650
a lay order of the Franciscans,
so that he practiced therefore,

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:21.268
truly, literally in his own
life, that which Francis himself

01:07:21.268 --> 01:07:25.260
had practiced and preached so
maybe that's what--

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.110
probably if you weren't asking
that maybe you should have been

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:29.840
asking that and I would have
been--

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.599
I would have said that.
 

01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:50.900
Other questions or--we have a
few minutes so--yes.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.800
Student:  Is the story
of the Sultan--

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:59.920
supposed to revise our view of
Dante's relation--

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:04.590
Dante's view of Islam that we
took away from the

01:08:04.590 --> 01:08:07.822
Inferno,
from the encounter with

01:08:07.822 --> 01:08:08.449
Mohammad.
 

01:08:08.449 --> 01:08:09.650
Prof: That's a very good
question.

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:15.320
Is the view of Francis going to
the Sultan supposed--

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:20.858
is it meant to revise the view
that we may have formed of

01:08:20.858 --> 01:08:26.989
Dante's attitude toward Islam
reading Inferno XXVIII?

01:08:26.989 --> 01:08:31.238
I think so.
 

01:08:31.238 --> 01:08:35.828
My answer is that I--that's why
I was stressing this,

01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:41.337
that there is a sort of a
radical turning that takes place

01:08:41.337 --> 01:08:45.340
in Francis,
operates a change in the way

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:50.828
that Christians and the Muslims
can go on thinking of their

01:08:50.828 --> 01:08:52.060
encounter.
 

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.987
It's no longer through armies,
if it's through peaceful

01:08:55.987 --> 01:08:56.859
discourse.
 

01:08:56.859 --> 01:09:01.009
From this point of view,
Francis carries on a tradition

01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:04.158
that started with Peter the
Venerable,

01:09:04.158 --> 01:09:09.662
there were a few other
theologians who had a kind of

01:09:09.662 --> 01:09:16.353
view that was not through wars
that this kind of dialogue could

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:19.688
take place,
if war is a form of dialogue,

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.020
I'm not sure of course.
 

01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.738
Dante acknowledges that in
Francis,

01:09:24.738 --> 01:09:29.930
and I think that he dramatizes
it, just as he is dramatizing

01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:34.050
the sense of the awareness,
which was very central to

01:09:34.050 --> 01:09:37.454
Bonaventure,
of the relationship of the

01:09:37.454 --> 01:09:40.975
three, to him,
the three religions:

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:45.328
the Hindus, the Christians,
and the Muslims.

01:09:45.328 --> 01:09:50.094
And retrospectively,
it forced me to now say things

01:09:50.094 --> 01:09:55.525
about schism that I did not say
when we were reading Canto

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:58.987
XXVIII,
that schism--we have a presence

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.868
there of,
you remember,

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:05.326
all forms of schism;
the religious schism with a

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:10.819
friar who decides who is really
a joachist, by the way,

01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:11.939
Dolcino.
 

01:10:11.939 --> 01:10:15.238
There was the poet who,
by the power of his words,

01:10:15.238 --> 01:10:18.104
Bertrand de Born,
the Provencal poet divides

01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:20.819
father from son,
the king from the son,

01:10:20.819 --> 01:10:24.310
and therefore breaks the unity
of the body politic,

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:28.695
the idea that the king's two
bodies and the famous formula of

01:10:28.695 --> 01:10:33.010
the book of the great historian
&gt;

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:34.880
so that he broke that kind of
unity.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:38.460
There is then an allusion to a
story from Lucan,

01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:45.265
one of the soldiers Curio,
who broke away from Pompeii and

01:10:45.265 --> 01:10:47.180
he had,
from Caesar,

01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:49.279
and he had his own tongue cut
off.

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:53.529
It's clear that schism is to be
understood linguistically.

01:10:53.529 --> 01:10:59.203
I am not revising my view but
now I can tell you what I always

01:10:59.203 --> 01:11:04.689
thought was underlying the
representation of even Islam,

01:11:04.689 --> 01:11:07.945
which means that even the
interpretation of Mohammed in

01:11:07.945 --> 01:11:11.085
XXVIII,
horrifying though as it is,

01:11:11.085 --> 01:11:15.873
it really appears as if
Mohammed was the one who was

01:11:15.873 --> 01:11:21.925
doubling the existing unity--
that's it, through the power of

01:11:21.925 --> 01:11:24.720
speech,
that's the view.

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:26.298
It's a horrifying
representation,

01:11:26.298 --> 01:11:28.569
that does not take anything
away from that,

01:11:28.569 --> 01:11:32.644
but clearly you see that
the--Dante's understanding of

01:11:32.644 --> 01:11:36.871
these issues is a little bit
more nuanced than it may at

01:11:36.871 --> 01:11:38.640
first sight appear.
 

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.340
When we come later in the
Heaven of Justice,

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.840
and before we get to Heaven of
Justice,

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:47.618
Dante goes on talking about the
warriors and he begins with

01:11:47.618 --> 01:11:52.807
Joshua,
the hero who brings about the

01:11:52.807 --> 01:11:57.189
destruction of Jericho etc.
 

01:11:57.189 --> 01:12:02.345
By the end he also mentions the
crusaders, so there is a kind of

01:12:02.345 --> 01:12:07.337
ambiguity that I would say that
he still values what he thinks

01:12:07.337 --> 01:12:09.220
is the heroic life.
 

01:12:09.220 --> 01:12:11.306
Nonetheless,
after I say this,

01:12:11.306 --> 01:12:14.618
let me just state another point
about Dante.

01:12:14.618 --> 01:12:17.420
That's true,
that clearly he's talking from

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:21.220
a Christina standpoint,
there's no question about this.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:25.063
But the underlying spirituality
of Dante is what I call the

01:12:25.063 --> 01:12:27.779
"spirituality of the
desert."

01:12:27.779 --> 01:12:31.184
Dante's truly the "poet of
the desert"

01:12:31.184 --> 01:12:35.601
in the sense that in the desert
you have modes of a quest that

01:12:35.601 --> 01:12:39.871
where everyone is really going,
because wherever we are going,

01:12:39.871 --> 01:12:41.920
we are always going to the
absolute.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.395
Whatever journey we may take
it's always the same journey and

01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:48.118
so the spirituality of the quest
is sort of--

01:12:48.118 --> 01:12:53.762
I won't say overhauls,
but at least tempers this idea

01:12:53.762 --> 01:13:00.274
of Dante being so strict and
firm in this universe of degrees

01:13:00.274 --> 01:13:04.288
and distinctions that he sets
up.

01:13:04.288 --> 01:13:08.792
I don't know if I clarified
this for you,

01:13:08.792 --> 01:13:09.579
okay.
 

01:13:09.579 --> 01:13:10.600
Thank you so much.

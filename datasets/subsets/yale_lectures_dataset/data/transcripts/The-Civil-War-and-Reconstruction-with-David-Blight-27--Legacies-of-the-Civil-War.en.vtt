00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.174
Professor David Blight:
I'm going to talk for a few

00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:07.190
minutes about this memory
question.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.008
There's an article assigned at
the very end of the reading

00:00:12.008 --> 00:00:16.320
packet that you perhaps have
read by now, I hope.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.162
A piece I wrote some years ago
which gives you kind of a breezy

00:00:21.162 --> 00:00:25.535
take on some of the complexities
of how the Civil War and

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:30.300
Reconstruction have been
remembered in the United States.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.568
It is arguably the most vexing
piece of our past for our larger

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:43.770
political, public culture to
process.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.720
You can simply do it this way,
though.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.719
This is one of the people that
Tony Horwitz interviewed in his

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.030
wonderful book Confederates
in the Attic,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.800
which some of you may have
read.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.284
A quite popular book;
it came out about five years

00:00:57.284 --> 00:00:59.716
ago.
Horwitz, a great journalist,

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:04.195
did a travel book all over the
South and tried to come to some

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:07.280
grips and understanding of many
things,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.426
but particularly of Civil War
buffs and Civil War

00:01:11.426 --> 00:01:16.523
enthusiasm--of why this event
endures so much in our popular

00:01:16.523 --> 00:01:20.229
culture.
Among the people he interviewed

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.622
was this guy who said,
quote: "I think there's a lot

00:01:24.622 --> 00:01:29.445
of people like me who want to
get back to a simpler time:

00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:32.879
sandlot baseball,
Cowboys and Indians,

00:01:32.879 --> 00:01:34.420
and the Civil War."

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.871
Just take me away.
Wherever my present is,

00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.244
whatever my life is,
just transport me,

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:49.061
to the morning of July 3^(rd)
at Gettysburg,

00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:51.280
or some other place.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.135
There was a musician
interviewed on NPR yesterday

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:03.415
morning who's been through a
horrible life of drugs and

00:02:03.415 --> 00:02:07.637
alcohol addiction.
At the end of it he was asked

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:12.164
to give the biggest influences
on his recovery and his

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.626
survival,
and he said,

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:19.177
"Well, certain artists,
certain people,

00:02:19.177 --> 00:02:24.733
but mostly the Civil War."
And that's where the interview

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:27.384
ended.
I was dying to find out what

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:33.220
the hell did that mean?
Good God Almighty.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.729
But God bless him.
All right, legacies.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.800
Everything in history has a
legacy.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.250
We use the term all the time,
the legacies of this;

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.400
the legacies of that;
the legacies of that event;

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.599
what are the legacies of World
War Two?

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.450
What are the legacies of the
Civil Rights Movement?

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.400
But what is a legacy?
Stop for just a second with me.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.180
Let me attempt a definition,
some attempt.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.162
It can be simply another word
for historical memory,

00:03:00.162 --> 00:03:04.379
of how we remember things,
and then how we use them.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.330
It always carries some current,
present, and often political

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.655
meaning.
If you use the term legacy for

00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:19.930
something, it probably has a
current political stake.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.185
Reconstruction,
in our history,

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:26.319
was an ongoing referendum on
the meaning and legacies of

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.355
slavery in the Civil War.
And so much of our racial

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:34.810
history, our constitutional
history, our political history,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.752
ever since Reconstruction,
has been a referendum on the

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.599
meaning and memory of
Reconstruction.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.796
Was there a reconciliation in
the wake of these events,

00:03:45.796 --> 00:03:47.740
of sections,
of states,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.857
of soldiers,
of the political class,

00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:57.270
or of masters and slaves,
blacks and whites?

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.449
Who got reconciled and who
didn't?

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.969
Legacies, I'd suggest,
can be emotional.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:12.680
Test this with your parents or
your grandparents.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.434
Legacies can be emotional,
they can be intellectual,

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:19.819
they can be physical,
they can be financial,

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.966
they can be about habits,
they surely can be political,

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.730
and they can be sacred or
secular.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.356
My parents were the Great
Depression and World War Two

00:04:29.356 --> 00:04:31.240
generation and it was all over
them.

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:39.290
My father always feared
insurance.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.869
He always wanted to know
exact--he had no money but he

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:44.399
always wanted to know exactly
where his money was.

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:45.829
He almost kept it under a
pillow.

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:47.407
It was stupid,
it was crazy,

00:04:47.407 --> 00:04:50.853
but after the Depression and
five farm foreclosures that his

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:53.263
family had,
he couldn't stand letting

00:04:53.263 --> 00:04:56.269
anyone else have his couple of
thousand dollars.

00:04:56.269 --> 00:04:57.930
That's a legacy of the Great
Depression.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.299
It's a habit,
it's a point of view and it's a

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:01.430
set of assumptions.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.672
This event had so many legacies
that frankly we just keep adding

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:16.769
to them with time.
They just don't really go away.

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:21.545
Sometimes a legacy is perhaps
what is simply left over,

00:05:21.545 --> 00:05:24.841
out in public memory,
in our behavior,

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:28.391
in our policies,
after historians have written

00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:31.944
all their books,
museums have mounted all their

00:05:31.944 --> 00:05:35.300
exhibitions, teachers have
taught their classes,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.303
elders have tried to instruct
the young, at the grassroots

00:05:40.303 --> 00:05:44.992
level and in families.
The legacy is that which

00:05:44.992 --> 00:05:50.265
endures all of our filterings,
all of our debates,

00:05:50.265 --> 00:05:56.291
all of our struggles over
controlling the story we say we

00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:01.850
live in.
It is where the past and the

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.830
present meet.
And there's no event in

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.787
American history that's caused
more of these struggles--there

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:15.662
are others that compare--but
there's no others that's caused

00:06:15.662 --> 00:06:20.785
more struggles over just how the
past and present meet than our

00:06:20.785 --> 00:06:24.865
Civil War.
Just take some of these ideas

00:06:24.865 --> 00:06:28.740
as physical legacies,
emotional legacies.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:35.247
If you took the number of dead
in the American Civil War and

00:06:35.247 --> 00:06:39.769
you moved it to the present per
capita,

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:43.550
thirteen million Americans
would die in a war today.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:57.269
Slavery was gone,
anger at its loss had no end.

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:00.235
In the South,
the economy and the physical

00:07:00.235 --> 00:07:04.738
landscape was in collapse.
Two-thirds of Southern wealth

00:07:04.738 --> 00:07:09.610
of the ex-Confederate states was
destroyed, in four years,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.970
and a lot of that wealth,
of course, was slaves;

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.920
three-and-a-half billion
dollars worth.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.566
Forty percent of all Southern
livestock were dead at the end

00:07:20.566 --> 00:07:22.981
of the war.
Fifty percent of all farm

00:07:22.981 --> 00:07:28.404
machinery destroyed.
There was an enormous refugee

00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:31.422
problem.
Mobilization had occurred

00:07:31.422 --> 00:07:33.539
unmatched;
it will be unmatched until

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:34.300
World War Two.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.750
And in the South,
in particular,

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.152
the war had killed
approximately--killed or

00:07:46.152 --> 00:07:50.617
incapacitated,
excuse me--one of every four

00:07:50.617 --> 00:07:55.449
males from the age of sixteen to
forty-five.

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:00.935
How do you process that kind of
loss and destruction and

00:08:00.935 --> 00:08:06.720
violence in a society that must
find a way to reconcile?

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.399
You can't send the defeated
part somewhere else;

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:16.191
well could've tried but Brazil
wouldn't take them all,

00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:19.554
certainly Britain wouldn't take
them all, Mexico

00:08:19.554 --> 00:08:21.200
couldn't--wouldn't.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:29.699
How would this reconciliation
actually come?

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:35.774
I was doing research at
Huntington Library a couple of

00:08:35.774 --> 00:08:38.515
years ago.
I was actually there to give a

00:08:38.515 --> 00:08:41.065
lecture and I had two days to
kill and I was just playing

00:08:41.065 --> 00:08:42.750
around in the Allan Nevins
Papers;

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.552
Allan Nevins was a great Civil
War historian,

00:08:44.552 --> 00:08:48.159
back in the '50s and '60s.
I grew up reading his works.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.876
And I was actually giving a
lecture named for Allan Nevins,

00:08:50.876 --> 00:08:53.826
so I thought I'd spend a couple
of days in the Nevins Papers and

00:08:53.826 --> 00:08:57.235
just lose myself.
There's nothing better in the

00:08:57.235 --> 00:09:02.503
world, other than teaching this
class, than losing yourself in a

00:09:02.503 --> 00:09:06.350
great library for two days,
with no agenda.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.231
And I'm thumbing through the
Nevins Papers,

00:09:09.231 --> 00:09:12.868
it's a huge collection,
and I just bump into an essay,

00:09:12.868 --> 00:09:16.230
in manuscript form,
by my hero, Bruce Catton.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.137
I've mentioned him before.
I grew up reading his books,

00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:21.769
Stillness at Appomattox,
and so many others;

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:26.745
the great popular historian of
the Civil War in the '50s,

00:09:26.745 --> 00:09:30.560
'60s, '70s.
And here was this little essay,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.507
by Catton, entitled "The End of
the Centennial,

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:36.696
1965."
Note the date,

00:09:36.696 --> 00:09:40.539
the centennial of the U.S.
Civil War.

00:09:40.539 --> 00:09:43.205
Catton and Nevins had been
themselves directors,

00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:46.097
executive-directors,
presidents and vice-presidents,

00:09:46.097 --> 00:09:48.480
whatever they were called,
of the U.S.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.940
Centennial Commission for the
Civil War, a commission that was

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:57.399
in many ways a debacle because
it was all occurring--again,

00:09:57.399 --> 00:10:01.269
think of the dates--at the time
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:04.684
Anyway, I had just published a
book on Civil War memory,

00:10:04.684 --> 00:10:07.229
this long tome,
and here comes this little

00:10:07.229 --> 00:10:09.177
essay,
and I was thinking,

00:10:09.177 --> 00:10:12.530
oh, Bruce Catton,
I'm sure he'll agree with me.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:16.339
Huh.
Now in this essay,

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:20.589
which was later published I
discovered--and Catton wrote it

00:10:20.589 --> 00:10:24.840
in 1965--he muses about memory,
and he used the actual word

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.458
memory.
That was reassuring because I

00:10:27.458 --> 00:10:30.815
was writing about memory in a
world of academics who were

00:10:30.815 --> 00:10:34.411
always--were very suspicious
about what the hell this idea of

00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:38.472
memory was supposed to mean.
He marveled in this piece at

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:42.934
how Americans had healed--that
was his word--from their Civil

00:10:42.934 --> 00:10:45.909
War, from this kind of
blood-letting;

00:10:45.909 --> 00:10:49.112
how a nation over a hundred
years had healed,

00:10:49.112 --> 00:10:51.750
he said.
And that a nation could

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.320
actually commemorate a civil
war, so openly,

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.896
all over the landscape,
he said was truly remarkable,

00:10:59.896 --> 00:11:03.230
if not unprecedented in modern
history.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:08.558
The war, he said,
was--his word--a source of

00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:11.576
unity.
"The memory of our civil

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:16.304
war"--and I'm quoting Bruce
Catton, 1965--"has not been a

00:11:16.304 --> 00:11:19.260
divisive force in this country."

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.905
And I had one of those moments
where I said,

00:11:26.905 --> 00:11:29.750
oh God, Bruce,
say it ain't so;

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.279
you didn't say that.
Reminded me of the time I ran

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:37.946
into my greatest baseball hero
ever, in an airport--you

00:11:37.946 --> 00:11:41.779
probably don't even know him,
Al Kaline, the right fielder

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:44.860
for the Detroit Tigers,
the one and only Al Kaline;

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.717
only Roberto Clemente could
even come close to Kaline as a

00:11:47.717 --> 00:11:50.896
right-fielder.
I ran him into an airport once,

00:11:50.896 --> 00:11:55.343
end of his career--and I was
about 28--and he was smoking a

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:58.880
cigarette.
Damn.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.567
Don't meet your heroes.
How could Bruce have written

00:12:03.567 --> 00:12:06.807
that sentence?
I'd just written a 500-page

00:12:06.807 --> 00:12:10.429
book that argued exactly the
opposite.

00:12:10.429 --> 00:12:13.714
For forging all this unity--I
read on in the essay--for

00:12:13.714 --> 00:12:17.425
forging all this unity he gave
most of the credit to Grant and

00:12:17.425 --> 00:12:20.710
Lee at Appomattox and the nature
of the surrender;

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:27.220
the compassionate character of
that surrender at Appomattox.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.509
But then he went on.
He said primarily he gave

00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:34.192
credit to what he called the
Confederate legend,

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:38.660
which he described as--and I'm
quoting him: "a mighty,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.865
omnipresent force in the land.
In all seriousness"--still

00:12:43.865 --> 00:12:49.194
quoting Catton--"the legend of
the Lost Cause has been an asset

00:12:49.194 --> 00:12:54.610
to the entire country."
Now that just blew me away.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:13:00.350
Oh Bruce, please tell me you
didn't write that.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:04.753
Catton's portrayal of the Lost
Cause in this essay was that of

00:13:04.753 --> 00:13:08.460
a benign, innocent,
romantic cluster of legends

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.111
about the Old South,
driven by the assumption,

00:13:12.111 --> 00:13:14.422
as he put it,
that, quote:

00:13:14.422 --> 00:13:18.390
"no hint of enmity should ever
be kept alive."

00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:25.115
His Lost Cause,
in the brevity of one essay,

00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:28.789
was a story of noble sacrifice
by the South,

00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:32.409
and heroism,
of a nostalgia for an older

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:37.420
civilization that had been some
kind of bulwark against

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.151
modernism.
And in the end,

00:13:40.151 --> 00:13:43.969
as Catton put it,
the Confederate legend,

00:13:43.969 --> 00:13:46.832
the Lost Cause,
he said, quote,

00:13:46.832 --> 00:13:50.845
"saved us."
I couldn't really take it

00:13:50.845 --> 00:13:54.644
anymore.
At the very end of the essay

00:13:54.644 --> 00:14:00.888
Catton redeemed himself a bit.
He acknowledged that in 1965

00:14:00.888 --> 00:14:05.215
the war had left,
he said, the unfinished

00:14:05.215 --> 00:14:10.840
business of black equality as
its deepest legacy,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.482
and that, quote,
"the Negro was what the war was

00:14:15.482 --> 00:14:17.260
about, somehow."

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.704
Now that was probably--given
how closely Catton knew Lincoln,

00:14:25.704 --> 00:14:30.044
loved Lincoln--that was
probably a riff on Lincoln's use

00:14:30.044 --> 00:14:33.990
of the word 'somehow' in the
Second Inaugural,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.731
where Lincoln says,
"somehow, all knew the war was

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:40.963
about slavery."
And we've been trying to

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:45.153
explain that somehow in our 65
to 70,000 books on the

00:14:45.153 --> 00:14:48.779
Civil--well some of them
have--ever since.

00:14:48.779 --> 00:14:53.748
Now, I remember rising up from
that thinking well I just lost

00:14:53.748 --> 00:14:56.372
another hero.
How could Bruce Catton have

00:14:56.372 --> 00:14:58.906
said all this?
Well for one thing he never did

00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:01.879
any research on the Lost Cause.
He didn't know the Lost Cause.

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:05.659
He didn't know that the Lost
Cause became essentially a

00:15:05.659 --> 00:15:08.669
racial ideology,
that it became a cluster of

00:15:08.669 --> 00:15:10.494
legends,
as he put it,

00:15:10.494 --> 00:15:14.887
but a cluster of legends in the
service of white supremacy,

00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:18.220
a few assumptions in search of
a history,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.643
and an ideology that came to be
the buttressing,

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:29.688
the base of Jim Crow America.
But then I started thinking

00:15:29.688 --> 00:15:33.072
more and more,
and I began to realize,

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:39.072
don't be emotional about this,
Bruce Catton was actually in

00:15:39.072 --> 00:15:42.907
1965 capturing,
absolutely capturing,

00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:48.766
the mainstream American
conception of the Lost Cause and

00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:53.980
of Civil War memory.
That the South's heroism,

00:15:53.980 --> 00:16:00.201
that the Confederacy's effort
to stake all on the line for its

00:16:00.201 --> 00:16:04.485
independence,
that the glorious figure of a

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:08.158
Robert E.
Lee, the steadfastness of a

00:16:08.158 --> 00:16:12.442
Jefferson Davis,
had indeed become national

00:16:12.442 --> 00:16:17.384
phenomena.
Catton was just summing up the

00:16:17.384 --> 00:16:21.889
mainstream of American thought
by the 1960s.

00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:25.084
And that old cliché
that you've heard,

00:16:25.084 --> 00:16:29.223
perhaps before many times,
that the South lost the war but

00:16:29.223 --> 00:16:32.376
won the peace,
or the South lost the war but

00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:36.198
won the debate over the memory,
was basically what Catton was

00:16:36.198 --> 00:16:40.059
summing up.
I think Catton believed this

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:41.550
too.
But I let him off the hook.

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:48.927
Because by circa 1965 the
understanding of the American

00:16:48.927 --> 00:16:52.278
Civil War in the broad
mainstream culture--not among

00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.957
most African-Americans--and now
a new young generation of

00:16:55.957 --> 00:16:59.767
historians who came of age in
the wake of World War Two and

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:03.446
were deeply interested in the
problem of race in American

00:17:03.446 --> 00:17:07.665
history as never before,
and deeply inspired by an

00:17:07.665 --> 00:17:09.968
anthropological,
sociological,

00:17:09.968 --> 00:17:13.859
psychological revolution in the
study of race,

00:17:13.859 --> 00:17:15.550
were beginning to write about
it differently.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.801
The great Southern poet,
who lived much of his life,

00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:23.710
much of the second half of his
life,

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:28.465
right here, and whose papers
are right there,

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:32.140
at Beinecke,
Robert Penn Warren,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.224
wrote brilliantly about this in
a little book,

00:17:35.224 --> 00:17:39.406
a little essay--actually a big
essay in a little book--that he

00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:43.519
wrote in 1961 called The
Legacy of the Civil War.

00:17:43.519 --> 00:17:44.990
He wrote it for Life
magazine.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.420
It was later published as a
book.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.763
In that book,
trying to capture what the

00:17:49.763 --> 00:17:53.189
meaning of the Civil War was in
American culture 100 years

00:17:53.189 --> 00:17:55.609
after,
Penn Warren said that

00:17:55.609 --> 00:18:00.723
"somewhere in their bones"--and
I quote him--"most Americans

00:18:00.723 --> 00:18:05.750
have a storehouse of lessons
drawn from the Civil War."

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:09.451
Now exactly what those lessons
should be has been,

00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:13.908
I think, the most contested
question in America's historical

00:18:13.908 --> 00:18:17.007
memory,
over and over again,

00:18:17.007 --> 00:18:22.448
at least since 1865 and
probably even since 1863,

00:18:22.448 --> 00:18:26.869
when the war underwent a
revolution.

00:18:26.869 --> 00:18:30.255
"Among all the possible lessons
of our Civil War," wrote Robert

00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:33.079
Penn Warren,
"is the realization"--his

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:37.938
words--"that slavery looms up
mountainously in the story and

00:18:37.938 --> 00:18:42.174
cannot be talked away."
Our culture has spent nearly

00:18:42.174 --> 00:18:45.839
now a century and a half,
and it is still at it,

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:51.303
of talking away the place of
slavery in this event and its

00:18:51.303 --> 00:18:55.441
place in the aftermath.
"When one is happy in

00:18:55.441 --> 00:19:00.170
forgetfulness," said Penn
Warren, "facts get forgotten."

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:03.896
Or as William Dean Howells put
in 1900--and I think I quote

00:19:03.896 --> 00:19:07.366
this in the essay you've
read--what the American people

00:19:07.366 --> 00:19:10.093
always like is a tragedy,
as long as they can give it a

00:19:10.093 --> 00:19:10.510
happy ending.

00:19:16.049 --> 00:19:20.864
We have a tragic sensibility as
a culture, as long as we can see

00:19:20.864 --> 00:19:24.157
an exit from it.
All right, let me just give you

00:19:24.157 --> 00:19:27.993
three hooks to hang your hat on,
in terms of how Americans have

00:19:27.993 --> 00:19:30.946
processed this memory.
I've labeled them

00:19:30.946 --> 00:19:34.173
reconciliationist,
white supremacist and

00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:37.980
emancipationist,
and they simply mean this.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:41.735
There are some other ways of
thinking about how Civil War

00:19:41.735 --> 00:19:45.221
memory was processed,
but most of them can come under

00:19:45.221 --> 00:19:48.429
these categories.
A reconciliationist vision of

00:19:48.429 --> 00:19:51.160
this war took root in the midst
of the war.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:59.509
It took root especially in
dealing with all the dead.

00:19:59.509 --> 00:20:02.931
And Drew Faust's new book on
this, called Republic of

00:20:02.931 --> 00:20:04.735
Suffering,
is a must-read,

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:07.410
if you stay interested in this
subject.

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.730
I'm conducting an interview
with her tomorrow night in New

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.187
York about that book.
I've talked to so many people

00:20:14.187 --> 00:20:18.423
who keep telling me they can't
read past page fifty because

00:20:18.423 --> 00:20:21.776
it's so depressing.
And I usually say something

00:20:21.776 --> 00:20:24.600
stupid like, "It's good for you.
Take your pill."

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:32.234
The reconciliationist vision of
this war, somehow putting

00:20:32.234 --> 00:20:35.475
ourselves back together,
is rooted right there in

00:20:35.475 --> 00:20:40.050
putting bodies back together and
in putting hundreds of thousands

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:43.099
of bodies in the ground.
In Faust's book,

00:20:43.099 --> 00:20:46.109
as never before,
we are taken literally into

00:20:46.109 --> 00:20:49.060
those graves.
She has found tremendous

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:53.256
evidence of what soldiers
themselves did on battlefields

00:20:53.256 --> 00:20:57.437
to bury their own dead,
and sometimes even bury the

00:20:57.437 --> 00:21:02.319
enemy, to give people decent,
human burials after they'd been

00:21:02.319 --> 00:21:06.996
half eaten by dogs.
Nothing like burying a dead man

00:21:06.996 --> 00:21:11.185
without a coffin,
on a battlefield that you've

00:21:11.185 --> 00:21:16.213
known, will make you pray and
beg to be reconciled with

00:21:16.213 --> 00:21:20.156
something.
But a second kind of Civil War

00:21:20.156 --> 00:21:24.911
memory, if we can call it that,
was the white supremacist

00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:27.773
memory,
which took many forms early,

00:21:27.773 --> 00:21:31.440
including, of course,
the terror and violence of the

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:34.621
Klan and its many imitators,
in Reconstruction,

00:21:34.621 --> 00:21:36.947
and then locked arms
eventually, in the later

00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:39.750
nineteenth century and into the
twentieth century,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.231
with reconciliationists of all
kinds in our culture,

00:21:44.231 --> 00:21:49.240
and delivered the country a
racially segregated memory,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.739
a racially segregated story of
this experience,

00:21:54.739 --> 00:21:59.880
at least by 1900,
and really even before.

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.921
A third kind of memory,
always competing with these,

00:22:03.921 --> 00:22:07.250
we might call an
emancipationist memory,

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:11.956
embodied in African-Americans,
complex--and they had no single

00:22:11.956 --> 00:22:15.767
memory of slavery,
the war, emancipation and

00:22:15.767 --> 00:22:20.756
Reconstruction--in their own
complex remembrance of what

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:25.019
slavery and their freedom had
meant to them.

00:22:25.019 --> 00:22:28.494
But an emancipationist vision
of the Civil War was also rooted

00:22:28.494 --> 00:22:31.000
in the politics of Radical
Reconstruction,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.752
also rooted in the three
Constitutional amendments,

00:22:33.752 --> 00:22:37.220
and conceptions of the war as a
re-invention of the Republic,

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:42.275
and the liberation of blacks to
citizenship--blacks and

00:22:42.275 --> 00:22:46.769
eventually others--to
Constitutional equality.

00:22:46.769 --> 00:22:52.332
In the end what you have here
is the story eventually of how

00:22:52.332 --> 00:22:57.990
the forces of reconciliation
overwhelmed that emancipationist

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:04.677
vision in the national culture,
and how an inexorable drive for

00:23:04.677 --> 00:23:11.014
reunion of North and South,
both used race and then trumped

00:23:11.014 --> 00:23:14.714
it.
But the story doesn't just

00:23:14.714 --> 00:23:21.271
dead-end in this white supremacy
victory, this Lost Cause

00:23:21.271 --> 00:23:24.437
victory,
because eventually the Lost

00:23:24.437 --> 00:23:27.150
Cause wasn't about causes lost
at all.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.257
The Lost Cause ideology of the
South became a victory

00:23:31.257 --> 00:23:34.337
narrative, and the victory,
they argued,

00:23:34.337 --> 00:23:38.049
was a national victory over
Reconstruction.

00:23:38.049 --> 00:23:42.345
If you want to ask what was the
biggest success in the long

00:23:42.345 --> 00:23:47.232
struggle over Civil War memory,
it was the success of the Lost

00:23:47.232 --> 00:23:51.628
Cause ideology in selling
themselves to northerners who

00:23:51.628 --> 00:23:54.879
bought in and said,
"yes, the nation has finally

00:23:54.879 --> 00:23:57.330
triumphed over the mistake of
Reconstruction."

00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:03.618
But there was a fledgling
neo-abolitionist tradition,

00:24:03.618 --> 00:24:06.664
that emancipationist vision of
the Civil War never died a

00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:08.839
permanent death in American
culture,

00:24:08.839 --> 00:24:12.445
by any means,
kept alive by blacks,

00:24:12.445 --> 00:24:16.369
black leadership,
and white allies.

00:24:16.369 --> 00:24:20.327
There is a persistence of that
memory that, frankly folks,

00:24:20.327 --> 00:24:24.839
made possible the Civil Rights
Revolution of the '50s and '60s,

00:24:24.839 --> 00:24:26.130
and it was happening even
before the '50s.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.873
But if one thing in particular
happened to the memory of the

00:24:37.873 --> 00:24:42.261
Civil War, it found it its way
eventually into a broad

00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:45.207
consensus,
in the broader national

00:24:45.207 --> 00:24:49.403
culture--this was never
unanimous of course--but in the

00:24:49.403 --> 00:24:52.589
broader national culture that
somehow,

00:24:52.589 --> 00:24:55.455
in this war,
in this Armageddon,

00:24:55.455 --> 00:25:00.076
in this blood-letting,
everybody had been right and

00:25:00.076 --> 00:25:03.863
nobody had been wrong.
You want to reconcile a country

00:25:03.863 --> 00:25:06.230
that's had a horrifying civil
war, how do you do it?

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.470
Well, you start building
thousands upon thousands of

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.944
monuments.
You start having soldier

00:25:15.944 --> 00:25:17.466
reunions.
You've read about the

00:25:17.466 --> 00:25:19.200
Gettysburg Reunion in this essay
of mine;

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.831
I won't even go into that,
the biggest of all the

00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:24.243
Blue-Grey Reunions,
which became the Jim Crow

00:25:24.243 --> 00:25:27.369
Reunion by 1913.
And Ken Burns did not tell you

00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:30.480
that in his film,
and played a very interesting

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.607
trick on you with that editing
button by showing you black and

00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:38.057
white veterans at the 1913
Reunion shaking hands--an

00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:41.809
irresistible,
beautiful, emotional moment.

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:46.289
The trouble is those veterans
were shaking hands 25 years

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:49.569
later, in 1938,
at the New Deal Reunion at

00:25:49.569 --> 00:25:53.048
Gettysburg.
They weren't there in 1913,

00:25:53.048 --> 00:25:57.520
but in the film that's
certainly what it looks like.

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:03.188
The power of filmmaking.
There was a popular novel

00:26:03.188 --> 00:26:07.643
published in 1912--there were a
zillion popular novels published

00:26:07.643 --> 00:26:11.085
about the Civil War.
But this one was by a Southern

00:26:11.085 --> 00:26:13.566
woman writer,
a very interesting writer we

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:16.195
don't read much today,
if anybody reads her,

00:26:16.195 --> 00:26:18.320
although she was important in
her time.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:24.012
Her name was Mary Johnston.
She was a Virginian,

00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:28.625
born to the upper crust of
Virginia planter life,

00:26:28.625 --> 00:26:33.061
born just after the war.
She was imbued with the Lost

00:26:33.061 --> 00:26:35.561
Cause tradition,
but grew up wanting to

00:26:35.561 --> 00:26:39.714
interrogate it a little bit.
She was a Lost Causer but she

00:26:39.714 --> 00:26:43.599
asked questions about it.
She became a suffragist.

00:26:43.599 --> 00:26:46.460
A progressive woman in so many
ways.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:49.599
She wrote a trilogy of Civil
War books.

00:26:49.599 --> 00:26:52.344
Her most famous book,
and it was a huge bestseller,

00:26:52.344 --> 00:26:54.539
was called To Have and to
Hold.

00:26:54.539 --> 00:26:58.127
But one of her trilogy is a
novel called Cease

00:26:58.127 --> 00:27:01.640
Firing, which also was a
near bestseller.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.633
And in Cease Firing,
on the last page of the book,

00:27:05.633 --> 00:27:08.700
she has Lee's Army retreating
from Richmond,

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.910
out toward their surrender at
Appomattox.

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.131
And she's a good writer.
And literally,

00:27:16.131 --> 00:27:18.964
on the last two pages,
she has two Confederate

00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:21.357
soldiers, in their rags,
half- starved,

00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:22.680
in conversation.

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:31.030
And one of these old veterans
asks the other what he thinks it

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.519
all means--"what's it all about
brother?"

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:38.854
And the other answers and says,
"I think that we were both

00:27:38.854 --> 00:27:42.653
right, and both wrong,
and that in the beginning each

00:27:42.653 --> 00:27:45.809
side might've been more patient
and much wiser.

00:27:45.809 --> 00:27:48.240
Life and history,
and right and wrong,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.460
in the minds of men,
look out of more windows than

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.231
we used to think.
Did you never hear of the

00:27:54.231 --> 00:27:57.293
shield that had two sides and
both were made of precious

00:27:57.293 --> 00:27:57.850
metal?"

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:07.250
Why didn't we just get along?
We were both right.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:11.341
Now, that's an honest sentiment
she puts in the mouths of a

00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:15.715
half-starved Confederate veteran
who's lucky to be alive and is

00:28:15.715 --> 00:28:20.089
now either about to desert or
surrender to the Union Army,

00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:24.769
neither option of which he ever
hoped to live to have to face.

00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:28.630
And she also captures in that
moment a very honest sentiment

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.509
that had set in all over
American culture,

00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:34.196
especially in veterans'
culture, at all those Blue-Grey

00:28:34.196 --> 00:28:37.082
Reunions--and the Gettysburg
Blue-Grey Reunion was about to

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.967
occur the following year after
this book was published--and

00:28:39.967 --> 00:28:42.604
that is this sense of the
mutuality of sacrifice among

00:28:42.604 --> 00:28:43.450
soldiers.

00:28:47.359 --> 00:28:56.325
Cure the hatreds of war by
bringing the warriors together,

00:28:56.325 --> 00:29:03.559
because they have a mutuality
of experience.

00:29:03.559 --> 00:29:08.743
And there was,
of course, no lack of honor at

00:29:08.743 --> 00:29:14.631
Appomattox, on either side.
But outside of all that pathos,

00:29:14.631 --> 00:29:18.459
that understanding,
that sentiment that Americans

00:29:18.459 --> 00:29:23.025
had bought into by the millions,
there was, of course,

00:29:23.025 --> 00:29:28.013
another whole story going on,
out in American culture and in

00:29:28.013 --> 00:29:32.117
national memory.
In 1912, the NAACP counted

00:29:32.117 --> 00:29:35.480
seventy-two lynchings,
in America;

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.150
about ninety percent of whom
were African-Americans.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:41.912
By 1912, when that book was
published, the entire Jim Crow

00:29:41.912 --> 00:29:45.940
legal system and all of its
absurdities was fully in place,

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.024
roughly by about 1910,
across the South and in some of

00:29:49.024 --> 00:29:51.818
the border states,
and to some extent even in the

00:29:51.818 --> 00:29:52.400
North.

00:29:58.059 --> 00:30:05.619
An erasure of cultural,
historical, mnemonic erasure,

00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:12.395
had been going on for three,
four and five decades,

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:17.447
of emancipation,
from the national narrative of

00:30:17.447 --> 00:30:22.059
what this war had even ever been
about.

00:30:22.059 --> 00:30:25.266
That process led the great
black scholar,

00:30:25.266 --> 00:30:27.270
W.E.B.
Du Bois--same year,

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:32.240
1912--in the Crisis
magazine, the journal of NAACP,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.363
to conclude,
as he put it,

00:30:35.363 --> 00:30:42.358
"This country has had its
appetite for facts on the Civil

00:30:42.358 --> 00:30:48.480
War and the Negro problem
spoiled by sweets."

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:52.933
They'd eaten too much candy.
Let me give you one other

00:30:52.933 --> 00:30:56.119
example, from one of these other
Blue-Grey Reunions.

00:30:56.119 --> 00:30:59.508
By the 1890s--these weren't
easy to do, these Blue-Grey

00:30:59.508 --> 00:31:02.833
Reunions, bringing back
Confederate and Union veterans

00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:06.410
to old battlefields or sites and
cities and so forth,

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:09.795
these weren't easy to do.
They first attempted doing it

00:31:09.795 --> 00:31:11.844
in the 1870s.
Confederates didn't want to

00:31:11.844 --> 00:31:16.130
come to these things.
1880s even it wasn't easy to do.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:18.623
They had one at Gettysburg on
the twentieth anniversary and on

00:31:18.623 --> 00:31:21.983
the twenty-fifth anniversary,
but it was hard especially to

00:31:21.983 --> 00:31:25.954
get Confederates to go to
Gettysburg, the scene of their

00:31:25.954 --> 00:31:28.962
worst defeat.
But by the 1890s,

00:31:28.962 --> 00:31:34.086
twenty-five years out now,
and thirty years out,

00:31:34.086 --> 00:31:37.589
from the war,
with the transmission--and we

00:31:37.589 --> 00:31:41.289
know this about so many events
and the way generations learned

00:31:41.289 --> 00:31:44.807
from one another and the way
memory gets passed on--as soon

00:31:44.807 --> 00:31:47.779
as there is truly a generational
transition,

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:51.722
the old veterans,
as they get older,

00:31:51.722 --> 00:31:56.548
are willing to come.
The 1900 Blue-Grey Reunion was

00:31:56.548 --> 00:31:58.507
held in Atlanta.
And by the way,

00:31:58.507 --> 00:32:00.810
Southern cities started to
compete for these things just

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:02.568
like Northern cites,
because they were huge

00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:04.227
moneymakers.
Thousands and thousands of

00:32:04.227 --> 00:32:06.485
veterans would come with their
families and spend thousands and

00:32:06.485 --> 00:32:10.017
thousands of dollars.
Anyway, in 1900 the Blue-Grey

00:32:10.017 --> 00:32:14.048
was in Atlanta,
and during the major speeches

00:32:14.048 --> 00:32:18.079
at that reunion the Commander of
the GAR,

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:21.303
the Grand Army of the Republic,
the big Northern veterans'

00:32:21.303 --> 00:32:23.452
organization,
was a guy named Shaw from

00:32:23.452 --> 00:32:26.706
Massachusetts;
no relation to Robert Gould

00:32:26.706 --> 00:32:31.601
Shaw of the famous 54^(th) Mass.
And in his speech he lectured

00:32:31.601 --> 00:32:35.925
the Confederate veterans--this
guy had a lot of New England

00:32:35.925 --> 00:32:40.621
chutzpah--he lectured them about
their efforts to control school

00:32:40.621 --> 00:32:43.087
textbooks;
which by the way all veterans'

00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:44.750
organizations were absolutely
doing.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:48.605
Every Confederate veterans'
organization had its textbook

00:32:48.605 --> 00:32:51.634
committee, and many Union
veterans' posts and

00:32:51.634 --> 00:32:54.869
organizations had their textbook
committee.

00:32:54.869 --> 00:32:58.205
They were competing with one
another to control the story in

00:32:58.205 --> 00:33:01.880
America's textbooks and trying
to lobby and control publishers.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.854
Anyway, Commander Shaw was a
little exercised about this,

00:33:04.854 --> 00:33:06.660
and he said,
among other things,

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.465
quote--and you can almost see a
sort of schoolmarmish

00:33:10.465 --> 00:33:14.064
finger-wagging in what he says.
He said, quote,

00:33:14.064 --> 00:33:18.407
"Keeping alive sectional
teachings as to the justice and

00:33:18.407 --> 00:33:21.250
rights of the cause of the
South,

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:25.590
in the hearts of your children,
is all out of order.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:31.410
It is unwise and unjust."
Uh huh.

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:35.123
The Commander of the United
Confederate Veterans was none

00:33:35.123 --> 00:33:36.980
other than John B.
Gordon.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.373
John B.
Gordon had been a Confederate

00:33:38.373 --> 00:33:39.158
General.
John B.

00:33:39.158 --> 00:33:42.003
Gordon was the Confederate
General in charge of the

00:33:42.003 --> 00:33:45.190
stacking of the arms and the
surrender at Appomattox.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.893
John B.
Gordon then went on to get

00:33:46.893 --> 00:33:49.578
elected Governor and then
Senator from Georgia during

00:33:49.578 --> 00:33:52.194
Reconstruction.
He was also one of the founders

00:33:52.194 --> 00:33:55.304
of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia,
although he lied through his

00:33:55.304 --> 00:33:57.730
teeth in the KKK Hearings of
1871 about it.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.574
But John B.
Gordon, by the 1890s,

00:33:59.574 --> 00:34:02.109
became one of the most
ubiquitous and popular

00:34:02.109 --> 00:34:04.300
Confederate Memorial Day
speakers.

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:08.205
And he was good at it.
He got up to respond to

00:34:08.205 --> 00:34:14.480
Commander Shaw--and this is a
final passage in what he said.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.103
John B.
Gordon, 1900,

00:34:16.103 --> 00:34:19.920
head of the UCV,
United Confederate Veterans.

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:23.255
"When he tells me and my
Southern comrades that teaching

00:34:23.255 --> 00:34:27.075
our children that the cause for
which we fought and our comrades

00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:30.889
died is all wrong,
I must earnestly protest.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.060
In the name of the future
manhood of the South I protest.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.144
What are we to teach them?
If we cannot teach them that

00:34:37.144 --> 00:34:39.902
their fathers were right,
it follows that these Southern

00:34:39.902 --> 00:34:42.309
children must be taught that
they were wrong.

00:34:42.309 --> 00:34:46.569
I never will be ready to have
my children taught that I was

00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:51.489
ever wrong, or that the cause of
my people was unjust and unholy.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.369
Oh my friends,
you were right,

00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:54.990
but we were right too."

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:01.594
Everybody was right,
nobody was wrong,

00:35:01.594 --> 00:35:06.507
in a war that killed 620,000
people and maimed about 1.2

00:35:06.507 --> 00:35:10.170
million, and transformed the
society.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:10.810
But no one was wrong.

00:35:19.969 --> 00:35:23.835
In fact, by the 1890s,
as it is still today,

00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:28.599
it became very popular to be a
Confederate veteran.

00:35:28.599 --> 00:35:31.131
If you've read Tony Horwitz's
Confederates in the

00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:33.960
Attic, he showed how so many
Civil War re-enactors,

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.194
it appears still today,
prefer to re-enact Confederates

00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:41.759
than to re-enact Unionist,
although there are lots of

00:35:41.759 --> 00:35:44.155
Union re-enactors;
and there are now lots of black

00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:46.683
re-enactors.
Which raises a fascinating

00:35:46.683 --> 00:35:50.646
intellectual question,
which we don't have to dwell on

00:35:50.646 --> 00:35:52.730
now,
and that is why is defeat

00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:55.290
sometimes more interesting than
victory?

00:35:55.290 --> 00:36:00.530
Ask yourselves that.
Why do those Nazis never

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:05.079
disappear from the bookstore
shelves, often right up front?

00:36:05.079 --> 00:36:06.809
Nazis, dogs,
and the Civil War,

00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:09.979
as the publishers sometimes
tell you, if you write about

00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:12.170
those we'll buy it,
we'll sell it.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.340
Hate being in that category.

00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:21.521
And then there are those who
will say things like Nazis'

00:36:21.521 --> 00:36:24.944
Holocaust memoirs,
dogs, and the Civil War--horses

00:36:24.944 --> 00:36:27.039
too, big deal,
the horses.

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:29.407
Anyway, the Confederate
Veteran magazine,

00:36:29.407 --> 00:36:32.379
which became a very popular
magazine in the 1890s and lasted

00:36:32.379 --> 00:36:35.100
like thirty-five years into the
twentieth century,

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:41.795
ran this little story in 1894.
It reported a story of a

00:36:41.795 --> 00:36:43.192
Southern woman,
a white woman,

00:36:43.192 --> 00:36:45.070
and her son,
attending a production,

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:47.690
a theater production in
Brooklyn, New York,

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.559
of the play called Held by
the Enemy.

00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:54.701
And theater productions,
plays, about the Civil War,

00:36:54.701 --> 00:36:58.923
especially with some kind of
reconciliationist theme,

00:36:58.923 --> 00:37:02.090
became wildly popular by the
1890s.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:06.736
The boy, sitting there with his
mother, according to the

00:37:06.736 --> 00:37:09.608
anonymous author,
asked his mother,

00:37:09.608 --> 00:37:13.409
"What did the Yankees fight
for, Mother?"

00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:19.472
And as the orchestra strikes up
"Marching Through Georgia," the

00:37:19.472 --> 00:37:22.308
woman answers,
"For the Union,

00:37:22.308 --> 00:37:24.929
darling."
Painful memories,

00:37:24.929 --> 00:37:29.535
we're told, bring sadness to
the mother's face as she hears

00:37:29.535 --> 00:37:34.118
the Yankee victory song.
And then earnestly the boy

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:39.090
asks, "What did the Confederates
fight for, Mother?"

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.021
And before the mother can
answer, the music changes to

00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.360
"Home Sweet Home," which fills
the theater,

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.342
says the author,
with its depth of untold melody

00:37:51.342 --> 00:37:55.077
and pathos.
The mother whispers her answer

00:37:55.077 --> 00:37:58.099
to her son.
"Do you hear what they are

00:37:58.099 --> 00:38:00.733
playing?
That is what Confederates

00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:04.489
fought for darling."
And the boy counters,

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:07.969
"Did they fight for their
homes?"

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:11.689
And with the parent's
assurance, the boy bursts into

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:16.429
tears, and with what the author
calls "the intuition of right,"

00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:20.966
he hugs his mother and
announces, "Oh Mother,

00:38:20.966 --> 00:38:23.750
I will be a Confederate."

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:33.598
They just fought for their
homes, that's all you needed to

00:38:33.598 --> 00:38:36.472
know.
Now it may be all a mother

00:38:36.472 --> 00:38:39.449
would want her little boy to
know.

00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:43.992
But all over American culture
there were millions who didn't

00:38:43.992 --> 00:38:46.380
really want to know any more.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:56.079
Everybody was right,
nobody was wrong.

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:59.245
There are a hundred ways to
plant this story,

00:38:59.245 --> 00:39:02.411
or examples through which to
tell this story,

00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:06.440
and I don't want to take really
any more time on it.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.453
You can read a book called
Race and Reunion,

00:39:09.453 --> 00:39:12.340
if it ever so moves you.
I want to get to our review;

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.174
yes I am getting to our review.
But I do want to leave you with

00:39:17.174 --> 00:39:25.300
this thought;
two images, if I can;

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.030
three images actually.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:34.605
Or two metaphors;
one I guess isn't quite a

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:37.270
metaphor.
In the second chapter of Du

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.652
Bois' The Souls of Black
Folk--okay,

00:39:39.652 --> 00:39:42.723
I'm going to test you,
how many of you have read

00:39:42.723 --> 00:39:47.599
The Souls of Black Folk?
Oh, we got work to do at Yale.

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:49.744
No one should have a degree
from Yale without reading The

00:39:49.744 --> 00:39:51.518
Souls of Black Folk.
No one should have U.S.

00:39:51.518 --> 00:39:53.679
citizenship without reading
The Souls of Black Folk.

00:39:53.679 --> 00:39:58.059
But since I don't rule the
world, who cares?

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:01.886
Chapter 2 of Du Bois'
masterpiece is an essay he

00:40:01.886 --> 00:40:06.056
called "The Dawn of Freedom."
It starts out ostensibly as an

00:40:06.056 --> 00:40:09.239
essay on, kind of a little
history of The Freedmen's Bureau

00:40:09.239 --> 00:40:11.380
and a little take on
Reconstruction,

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:14.509
but he turns it into much, more.
He turns it into a

00:40:14.509 --> 00:40:19.206
meditation--not unlike Penn
Warren will do in 1961--but a

00:40:19.206 --> 00:40:23.400
mediation on the meaning and
memory of slavery,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.510
the Civil War and
Reconstruction.

00:40:28.019 --> 00:40:31.367
And he goes into a discussion,
as only Du Bois could,

00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:35.230
because Du Bois was really a
poet-historian or a historian as

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:38.457
poet.
He begins to discuss how bleak

00:40:38.457 --> 00:40:42.341
life actually is on the ground,
in the South,

00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:46.048
not just for the freedmen as
sharecroppers,

00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:50.718
but for whites as well;
that poverty is a black and

00:40:50.718 --> 00:40:54.094
white thing, he says.
He's got another chapter to

00:40:54.094 --> 00:40:57.320
come in the book called "The
Black Belt," where he shows

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.195
that, that poverty is something
Southerners share,

00:41:00.195 --> 00:41:01.310
if they would.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.793
And then he stops and he says,
in effect, see this picture

00:41:08.793 --> 00:41:12.100
with me through what he calls
two figures.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.396
He says they're two figures,
in his view,

00:41:20.396 --> 00:41:26.690
that typify the post-war era
and the power of its legacy.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.215
Here's the passage.
"Two figures," says Du Bois,

00:41:30.215 --> 00:41:34.212
quote, "the one a grey-haired
gentleman whose fathers had quit

00:41:34.212 --> 00:41:37.325
themselves like men,
whose sons lay in nameless

00:41:37.325 --> 00:41:41.093
graves, who bowed to the evil of
slavery because its abolition

00:41:41.093 --> 00:41:44.878
threatened untold ill to all;
who stood at last,

00:41:44.878 --> 00:41:48.597
in the evening of life,
a ruined form,

00:41:48.597 --> 00:41:53.959
with hate in his eyes."
Your first figure is an old

00:41:53.959 --> 00:42:00.170
white man, probably a former
planter, who's lost everything.

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:08.704
He's bitter, he's really bitter.
He feels a burden of Southern

00:42:08.704 --> 00:42:11.732
history.
And then Du Bois says,

00:42:11.732 --> 00:42:14.944
"And the other,
a form hovering dark and

00:42:14.944 --> 00:42:18.170
mother-like,
her awful face black with the

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.465
mists of centuries,
had aforetime quailed at that

00:42:21.465 --> 00:42:24.692
white master's command,
had bent in love over the

00:42:24.692 --> 00:42:27.751
cradles of his sons and
daughters, and closed in death

00:42:27.751 --> 00:42:31.674
the sunken eyes of his wife;
and ay too, at his behest,

00:42:31.674 --> 00:42:36.516
had laid herself low to his
lust and borne a tawny man child

00:42:36.516 --> 00:42:40.284
to the world,
only to see her dark boy's

00:42:40.284 --> 00:42:46.137
limbs scattered to the winds by
midnight marauders riding after

00:42:46.137 --> 00:42:50.853
'Damned Niggers.'"
The second image,

00:42:50.853 --> 00:42:55.999
an old black woman,
former slave,

00:42:55.999 --> 00:43:01.949
mammy, but also broken,
no future,

00:43:01.949 --> 00:43:04.802
doesn't even know where that
son might be,

00:43:04.802 --> 00:43:09.969
and the son is probably dead.
But Du Bois presses the issue.

00:43:09.969 --> 00:43:13.498
Du Bois had a genuine sense of
tragedy and he didn't care

00:43:13.498 --> 00:43:16.460
sometimes whether he gave you a
happy ending.

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.670
He pressed the issue.
He says then,

00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:23.076
"These were the saddest
sights"--I'm quoting--"of that

00:43:23.076 --> 00:43:26.929
woeful day,
and no man clasped the hands of

00:43:26.929 --> 00:43:31.440
these passing figures of the
present-past"--legacy,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.761
where past and present meet.
"No man clasped the hands of

00:43:35.761 --> 00:43:38.650
these passing figures of the
present-past;

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:44.250
but hating they went to their
long home, and hating their

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:49.177
children's children live today."
Now, unmistakably,

00:43:49.177 --> 00:43:54.610
Du Bois is using that language
of clasping hands for a purpose,

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.765
because it's by far the most
ubiquitous image used in all the

00:43:57.765 --> 00:44:00.389
Blue-Grey Reunions,
by the '90s.

00:44:00.389 --> 00:44:03.707
He first wrote this essay in
1897 and revised the Souls of

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:07.500
Black Folk in 1903.
But the most ubiquitous image

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:11.823
in all the Blue-Grey reunions
was--in fact the slogan

00:44:11.823 --> 00:44:15.730
was--clasping hands across the
bloody chasm.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.943
And the shaking of hands,
of the Blue and the Grey,

00:44:18.943 --> 00:44:21.770
the old Confederate vets,
the old Union vets,

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.500
was always the photo op;
and it's all over the ending of

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:28.789
Burns' film.
And how can you resist it?

00:44:28.789 --> 00:44:31.961
In some ways,
what can be more beautiful than

00:44:31.961 --> 00:44:34.484
old, old men,
chests full of medals,

00:44:34.484 --> 00:44:38.737
shaking hands across the walls
they tried to kill each other

00:44:38.737 --> 00:44:41.357
over?
There's something human about

00:44:41.357 --> 00:44:43.500
that, that we can't quite
resist.

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.965
But Du Bois says, you know what?
There are two other kinds of

00:44:45.965 --> 00:44:48.275
veterans of the Civil War,
and no one's ever clasped their

00:44:48.275 --> 00:44:48.600
hand.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:02.332
And now I will just ask you to
think--I'm not doing this for

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:07.248
any political partisan reason--I
don't know if you've read it but

00:45:07.248 --> 00:45:11.090
at the very end of Barack
Obama's race speech.

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:14.710
I'm talking about Obama now as
a historian, not as a candidate.

00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:19.426
He's got enough problems
with...

00:45:19.426 --> 00:45:25.360
[Laughter]
Reverend Wright right now.

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.939
But this is Obama the writer.
And I don't know if he read

00:45:29.939 --> 00:45:33.668
Chapter 2 of Souls before
he wrote that speech,

00:45:33.668 --> 00:45:37.521
in Philadelphia a month ago;
it doesn't really matter if he

00:45:37.521 --> 00:45:38.733
did.
And I don't remember,

00:45:38.733 --> 00:45:40.823
if you read to the end of it,
if you've read it,

00:45:40.823 --> 00:45:42.957
or if you heard it--I've
actually never heard it,

00:45:42.957 --> 00:45:46.010
I've only read it.
But the way he ends that speech

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:50.070
is the way a lot of politicians
get up on the stump and talk.

00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:52.064
And at first you're ready to
dismiss it, it's another one of

00:45:52.064 --> 00:45:54.110
those stories of "well,
you know, I met somebody on the

00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:55.929
campaign trail and here's what
she said to me,

00:45:55.929 --> 00:45:57.469
and she had this terrible story
to tell;

00:45:57.469 --> 00:46:00.489
let me tell you her terrible
story."

00:46:00.489 --> 00:46:04.631
And you start tuning out like
"oh God, here comes another

00:46:04.631 --> 00:46:08.254
story of Old Aunt
Something-or-other on welfare or

00:46:08.254 --> 00:46:11.363
whatever."
But no, it's the story of a

00:46:11.363 --> 00:46:15.739
young twenty-three year old
white woman named Ashley Baia,

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:20.269
who is his campaign manager in
Florence, South Carolina.

00:46:20.269 --> 00:46:23.337
And he remembered the story of
when he, during the South

00:46:23.337 --> 00:46:25.624
Carolina primary,
he was doing an event in

00:46:25.624 --> 00:46:27.147
Florence,
South Carolina,

00:46:27.147 --> 00:46:29.909
and he meets Ashley and Ashley
tells him her story.

00:46:29.909 --> 00:46:34.264
And that story is,
in brief, that she grew up with

00:46:34.264 --> 00:46:38.351
a single mother,
poor, a poor white girl in the

00:46:38.351 --> 00:46:40.889
South.
At age about ten her mother got

00:46:40.889 --> 00:46:43.948
cancer, lost her job.
The family went bankrupt,

00:46:43.948 --> 00:46:46.860
etcetera, etcetera.
In order to help out her

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:50.303
mother--she told the story of
eating nothing but mustard and

00:46:50.303 --> 00:46:53.280
relish sandwiches for a year or
a year and half.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.896
Apparently her mother survived
but they never really--survived

00:46:57.896 --> 00:47:01.500
with a bankruptcy.
But somehow as she got older

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:05.342
she got interested in politics.
Now that's a white,

00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:08.934
lower working-class,
poor, southern girl who had

00:47:08.934 --> 00:47:13.750
every right to be in that group
Obama had described earlier,

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:18.145
who are the whites in America
with a lot of resentment of all

00:47:18.145 --> 00:47:21.469
the racial changes in America.
Instead she becomes his

00:47:21.469 --> 00:47:23.514
campaign manager,
and she put together this whole

00:47:23.514 --> 00:47:25.439
gathering in Florence,
in some, I don't know,

00:47:25.439 --> 00:47:27.120
church hall or wherever they
were meeting;

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.653
mostly black folk.
And then Obama describes how

00:47:30.653 --> 00:47:34.455
everybody in the room had to go
around and say why they were

00:47:34.455 --> 00:47:37.289
there, or what issue they were
there for.

00:47:37.289 --> 00:47:39.908
And he says,
with quite some directness,

00:47:39.908 --> 00:47:43.868
that most people did what most
people do, they name a single

00:47:43.868 --> 00:47:46.064
issue;
it's about them,

00:47:46.064 --> 00:47:48.159
it's about us,
right?

00:47:48.159 --> 00:47:52.079
It's not about the common good,
it's about us.

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:53.766
I want a better job,
I want healthcare,

00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:54.831
I want this,
I want that,

00:47:54.831 --> 00:47:56.030
I want, I want,
I want.

00:47:56.030 --> 00:48:00.083
Okay, fair enough.
And they finally come around to

00:48:00.083 --> 00:48:03.808
an old back man who's sitting
there, kind of at the end of the

00:48:03.808 --> 00:48:06.740
aisle, and he's asked,
"So why are you here?"

00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:11.400
Obama doesn't even name him.
He says, "I'm just here because

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:15.979
Ashley brought me here.
I'm only here because of

00:48:15.979 --> 00:48:19.386
Ashley."
Now Obama says--in effect,

00:48:19.386 --> 00:48:24.594
he develops at the end of the
speech a refrain about not this

00:48:24.594 --> 00:48:27.167
time, he says;
not this time,

00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:31.010
we're not going to let race
divide us this time.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:35.130
Like Du Bois' two figures,
hating, till their death;

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.850
and hating, their children's
children live today.

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:43.469
Well, here are two children.
But note what he's reversed.

00:48:43.469 --> 00:48:47.695
We got a young white woman who
should've been in the resentful

00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:51.578
white working-class,
and an old black man who no

00:48:51.578 --> 00:48:56.645
doubt grew up in Jim Crow and
probably has told story after

00:48:56.645 --> 00:49:01.625
story of the denigration or
destruction of his dignity for

00:49:01.625 --> 00:49:05.300
the first 45 years of his life.
But he's there because of

00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:05.470
Ashley.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.880
Thank you.

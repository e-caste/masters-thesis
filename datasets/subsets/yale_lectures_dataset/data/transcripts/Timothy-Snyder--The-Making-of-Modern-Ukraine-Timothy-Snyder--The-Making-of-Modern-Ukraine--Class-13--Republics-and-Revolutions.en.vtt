00:00:00.238 --> 00:00:02.821
(gentle music)

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.440
- Greetings, everybody. Happy Tuesday.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.340
We are now making the transition

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.580
into the 19th and the 20th centuries.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.290
By the end of this lecture,

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.290
we should be in 1918, 1919, 1920.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.350
The the premise of this lecture
is that we are talking about

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.918
revolutions and republics.

00:00:39.918 --> 00:00:44.918
The tricky thing about
the revolution of 1917,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.060
the Bolshevik Revolution,
like all revolutions,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.660
is that it pretends to start new.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.930
And in some way, revolutions do start new.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.630
Old elites are overthrown,
violence is applied,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.550
regimes are changed, and so on.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.360
But nevertheless, there
is a weighty inheritance,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.720
which will have to be dealt
with in one way or another.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.660
And so before we get to the revolution,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.740
we are going to make sure

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.380
that we have the 19th century down.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.470
I'm gonna spend some time
on the 19th century first.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.880
Something similar could
be said about republics,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.380
perhaps in a minor key.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.290
The republics that are founded in 1918

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.840
are founded as new states,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.210
as states that have broken completely

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.800
with their imperial past.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.950
So the most important
republic for us is going to be

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.000
the Polish Republic,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.948
which we'll be talking
about also on Thursday.

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:43.410
But are also two attempts
to start Ukrainian states,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.084
there's a West Ukrainian
National Republic,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.370
and a Ukrainian National Republic.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.760
And Republics, as new state forums

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.789
also a bit have this idea that
we've broken with the past,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.760
we've started something new.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.950
And naturally, as people studying history,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.550
we're going to be a little
bit suspicious of this

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.410
when we try to understand, for example,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.240
why the two Ukrainian attempts
at founding republics failed

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.670
it will help to know
about the history, right?

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.250
So, if we just talk about
the principle of the matter,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.020
there's no reason why the
Ukrainians wouldn't have had

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.470
a republic when, say
the Czechoslovaks did.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.640
If we were just going to talk about

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.848
measuring the political
devotion of people in 1918,

00:02:23.848 --> 00:02:27.270
many more people died for
Ukrainian independence in 1918,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.160
then died for Czechoslovak independence.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.199
That can't be the explanation either,

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.780
we're gonna need some
other sort of explanation.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.140
And whatever explanation it's going to be

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.683
history is going to help.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.990
It is true of course, that,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.240
and I'm sure you'll be
sad to see their passing,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.120
the empires we've been
studying do come to an end.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.680
They are going to come to an end.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.377
We're gonna bring them to
an end in this lecture.

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:52.288
The Habsburg monarchy, which has existed

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:55.650
in some form or another
for more than 500 years,

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.298
will come to an end in November of 1918.

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:01.230
The state based in Muscovy,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.490
which in some form or another,

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.280
has existed since the 15th century,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.250
and as the Russian Empire
has existed since 1721

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.770
will come to an end in 1917.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.680
Those two state forms will come to an end

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.780
and they'll be attempts at a fresh start.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.280
But our thesis here is,

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.920
there really isn't such
thing as a fresh start.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.837
So, I wanna try to begin
by making really clear

00:03:22.837 --> 00:03:25.757
a point that I was making last time

00:03:25.757 --> 00:03:28.980
about the significance of the division

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.380
of Ukrainian territory.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.526
It would be really, really
easy if we could teach classes,

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:38.850
and you can kind of see,
like in history textbooks

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.200
sort of dream of this too,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.200
where there was one territory
and there was one state,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.580
and there was one people, right?

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.540
Of course, if I say that,

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.490
it sounds rather fascist and it should,

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.290
but it would be really simple

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.457
if there were just one territory

00:03:50.457 --> 00:03:51.960
and the boundaries never changed,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.160
and there was one people there

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.350
and there was a state the whole time.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.775
That's never how it's
been for any country.

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.259
And we've been trying to explore the idea

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.630
that the divisions in
what will later become

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.840
the national territory
are not just a problem,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.370
but also a source of friction,
sometimes creative friction.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.520
That the differences between
different parts of a territory,

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.395
depending upon what empire it belongs to,

00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:18.480
matter not just as differences,

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.730
but sometimes as constructive components

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.730
of what will later become
a national society.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.070
And so to follow this,
to make this argument,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.790
we have to be really sure about
which parts of the country

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.920
belong to which territories.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.137
We are now in the 19th and 20th centuries

00:04:34.137 --> 00:04:36.870
moving for the first time into the moment

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.360
where what matters is
the east-west division.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.580
Where there is, you could reasonably say,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.040
there's something called Western Ukraine

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.600
centered in Galicia,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.296
which has a different experience
than the rest of Ukraine,

00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:53.100
which is in the Russian Empire.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.810
So, to review, you'll know that this is,

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.045
I know it's so hard,

00:04:59.045 --> 00:05:01.830
like I still struggle with
this and it's been 30 years,

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.830
but the left bank, the left
bank is the eastern part,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.620
and the right bank is
the western part, right?

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.910
Because you have to look at it

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.250
from the point of view of the river.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.470
And if you look at it, and
the river's flowing south.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.973
So if you can, you know,

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.855
I was about to make a drug joke,

00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:28.113
but I didn't because the camera's on,

00:05:28.113 --> 00:05:30.894
but you can laugh anyway, thank you.

00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:31.727
(student laughing)

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:33.115
I appreciate that.

00:05:33.115 --> 00:05:36.990
So you just look at it from
the point of view of the river.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.460
The left bank, the eastern
part comes under Russian rule

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.603
in the late 17th century, along with Kyiv.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.540
The right bank, right, the western half

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.060
comes under Russian rule
a hundred years later.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.290
So it's all under Russian rule,

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.460
but there's a meaningful difference

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.260
of a hundred years there.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.140
And then of course, there's
the third little part

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.600
with Galicia, which never comes
under Russian rule at all,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.943
but which falls under the Habsburgs.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.560
So I wanna pause and say a bit more

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.431
about some themes in the
history of Ukrainian territory

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:14.550
under Russia,

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.200
because all we managed
to really do last time

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.780
was to get the territory
straight, which is already a lot.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.220
But there are a couple
of important themes here,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.141
which I wanna make sure we get through.

00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:24.441
Having to do with social
history first of all.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.160
In 1861, serfdom is brought to an end.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.262
Russia has lost this war in Crimea,

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:35.520
a period of great reforms follows.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.982
The most important of these great reforms

00:06:36.982 --> 00:06:39.300
is the abolition of serfdom.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.353
So the vast majority of the population

00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:43.753
is no longer compelled
to work for the people

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:46.760
on whose land they live.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.100
There is a problem with the end of serfdom

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.840
which you can probably anticipate,

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.240
if you've ever thought at
all about how, you know,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.823
capitalism works, it's
kind of a familiar problem.

00:06:56.823 --> 00:07:00.633
People are freed from
their personal bondage

00:07:00.633 --> 00:07:02.970
to local landowners,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.720
but they're not given enough
land themselves to survive,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.400
right? Or to do well in general.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.630
So you have people who are,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.635
and so this raises this perpetual question

00:07:11.635 --> 00:07:13.560
about liberalism, right?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.660
Like, is negative freedom enough?

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.230
If I say, "You don't have
to do anything for me,

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.380
but I own all the land," what's
our relationship gonna be?

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.420
Well, you are, on Monday, you are freed,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.530
you got negative freedom,

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.540
but on Tuesday you have
to come to me and like,

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.670
take my conditions for
working my land, right?

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.890
So I'm simplifying a bit,
but that's the problem

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.300
at the end of Serfdom.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.413
People are personally
free, but how well they do

00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:38.910
and de facto how free
they're going to become

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.560
and what their political
attitudes might be,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.270
will depend on how much land they get.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.760
So from 1861 forward this land question

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.400
is gonna be a major theme
until industrialization,

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.080
which is second half of the 20th century

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.650
for most of this region, land
reform is a major question.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.660
In Ukraine in general,

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.600
peasants got very small land allotments,

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.995
smaller than the rest of the country,

00:07:58.995 --> 00:08:02.250
at a time of growing population.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:05.550
So there was a lot of
social economic pressure

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.300
on the bulk of the population,
which is in the countryside.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.060
And most of the population,
this is an important point,

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:13.470
stays in the countryside.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.000
So there's a stereotype
that the Ukrainians

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.833
are in the countryside,

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:17.610
and that stereotype is generally true.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.402
And there's a reason for it, which is that

00:08:19.402 --> 00:08:22.320
because the land is so fertile,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.782
it makes sense for me, I'll go
back to being the landowner,

00:08:24.782 --> 00:08:28.043
it makes sense for me
to keep you on that land

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:30.990
working for me to export
that grain if I can,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.163
because I can make a
profit that way, right?

00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:38.163
And that means that when when
industrialization takes place

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:40.430
in what's now southeastern Ukraine,

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.380
in the familiar part of Ukraine
which we call the Donbas,

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:44.670
you probably heard of the Donbas right?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.290
It just means the Donetsk basin.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.110
Like a lot of these like
apparently tricky, you know,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.920
Russian conglomerations, it
just means Donetsk basin, right?

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.540
So you can like impress your friends

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:55.634
with that bit of of knowledge.

00:08:55.634 --> 00:09:00.263
So, when the Donbas industrializes,
beginning of the 1870s,

00:09:00.263 --> 00:09:02.910
most of the peasants
who come to work there

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.434
are actually not Ukrainian.

00:09:04.434 --> 00:09:06.270
Most of the peasants
who come to work there

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.453
will be coming from Russia,
where the land is less fruitful,

00:09:09.453 --> 00:09:11.430
where the landlords have
less of an incentive

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.070
to keep people on the land.

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.133
And this is at the beginning
of a very important

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:20.250
social and economic change in Ukraine,

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.180
which is industrialization
and urbanization.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.750
There's coal in the
Donbas, there still is,

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.692
in the 1870s, 1880s, this becomes a source

00:09:30.692 --> 00:09:33.720
of most of the coal, about 70% of the coal

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.300
for the entire Russian Empire.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.850
In a familiar pattern, the coal is mined

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.700
under the auspices of foreign companies,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.980
usually British or French,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.980
although one of the most
famous of the industrialists

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.051
of the Donbas was a
man called John Hughes,

00:09:51.051 --> 00:09:53.190
who was Welsh.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.040
And he got a city named after
him, which is sort of cool,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.650
Iuzivka, right?

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.394
Which sounds like sounds
like a sort of deeply,

00:10:00.394 --> 00:10:01.920
Iuzivka, right?

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.110
Like what could be more
Ukrainian than Iuzivka,

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.700
is named after John Hughes.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:08.573
That city was later renamed Donetsk,

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.890
and then later renamed Stalino

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.897
and then later renamed Donetsk.

00:10:12.897 --> 00:10:17.331
And it's currently a few miles
behind the lines in this war.

00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:21.600
Another city which grows from nothing

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.980
during the period of industrialization

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.730
is called Kryvyi Rih, which, you know,

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.333
just means kind of twisted corner.

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:32.763
It's a beautiful name, right?

00:10:32.763 --> 00:10:34.830
Kryvyi Rih is where Zelens'kyi was born,

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:35.730
if that helps you at all.

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.370
It's in south central Ukraine.

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.589
And it was the, when
the railroad was built

00:10:41.589 --> 00:10:44.341
from the Donbas to Kryvyi Rih,

00:10:44.341 --> 00:10:46.710
then Kryvyi Rih is where
the iron was spelted.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.510
So this gives you an idea

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.640
of what this industrialization was like.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.580
It was nationally or
ethnically a bit strange

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.620
because it was largely
not the Ukrainian peasants

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:57.630
who were working there, but
largely Russian peasants.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:02.190
And also it was constrained
by internal tariffs.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:03.930
So the Ukrainian part
of the Russian empire

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.640
was producing coal and
it was producing iron,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.870
but it wasn't producing finished products.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.210
The finished products were sold back

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.080
into this part of the Russian Empire

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.500
at higher prices, right?

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.451
So this is a kind of classical form

00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:20.400
of colonial exploitation.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.040
There were internal tariffs
inside the Russian Empire,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.450
also applied to Poland, by the way.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.957
Okay? So this industrialization

00:11:27.957 --> 00:11:32.310
combined with Catherine
the Great's project

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.230
of a new Russia earlier on,

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.990
means that there are
essentially new cities

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.411
in what's now Ukraine.

00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:41.557
Iuzivka, which becomes Donetsk, new city.

00:11:41.557 --> 00:11:43.738
There's another city called Katerinaslav,

00:11:43.738 --> 00:11:46.260
which of course is after
Catherine the Great.

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:49.620
Katerinaslav is later
called Dnipropetrovsk

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.040
and it's now called Dnipro.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.470
And it's also also a major
industrial city of the southeast.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.980
So you have these, and
Odessa, which is again,

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.540
that's Catherine's, you know,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.880
delight for these Greek sounding things.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.985
So Odessa is the, you know,
the major port in Ukraine now,

00:12:06.985 --> 00:12:10.260
Odessa is a new city, Iuzivka new city,

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.230
Katerinaslav new cities,
and during the 19th century,

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:16.380
Kyiv and Kharkiv, which
are very old cities,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:18.510
are culturally Russified.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.090
They move in the opposite
direction of cities like Prague,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.170
which is very interesting.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.033
In the same decades where Prague,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.760
the main city in the Czech lands,

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.310
moves from being German
speaking to Czech speaking,

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.220
that is, it takes on the
language of the countryside,

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:33.780
in Kyiv it's the opposite.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.670
In Kharkiv, it's the opposite.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.470
In both of those cities in the
middle of the 19th century,

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.777
most people probably still spoke Ukrainian

00:12:39.777 --> 00:12:42.510
and the second most important
language was probably Polish

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.400
by the end of the 19th century

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.924
the most important
language in these cities

00:12:45.924 --> 00:12:48.480
is going to be Russia.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.820
So as these cities grow,

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.627
they become more culturally Russian.

00:12:53.627 --> 00:12:55.890
And the new cities in the southeast

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.980
also are largely Russian speaking. Okay?

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.320
So that introduces you to an issue

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.030
which you can see is still present

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.425
more than a hundred years later.

00:13:05.425 --> 00:13:07.020
Notice that in all of that,

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.776
I am talking about the eastern
part of Ukraine, right?

00:13:09.776 --> 00:13:11.430
The right bank.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:13.620
In the left bank matters
are a bit different.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.320
There isn't much urbanization over there.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.573
Yeah, I know, it's hard, pause.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.630
I don't know what to do. It's tricky.

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:23.067
The western part, right?

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.938
I may have even reversed it, sorry.

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:27.780
But the western part, right?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.690
The right bank is a different story.

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.690
There the Polish landlords
still own most of the land.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:39.510
There the key crops are things like beets.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.940
This is before sugar is being exported

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.620
from the Caribbean all
over the world and so on.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.840
So beets are raised to make sugar

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.513
and this is a world center of that.

00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:51.690
The old land structure, in other words,

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.585
is largely preserved in the right bank,

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:58.980
in the western part,
with the Polish landlords

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.750
pretty much all the way through.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:04.050
With severe land hunger and all the rest.

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:06.410
After 1861, the next
important turning point

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:09.813
in the Russian Empire is
the revolution of 1905,

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.306
which we can't skip over.

00:14:12.306 --> 00:14:14.340
So there's a pattern here,

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.290
it's a pretty important
historical pattern,

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.740
if you want to have your
country reform, lose a war.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.970
It's kind of a difficult plan,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:22.260
like it's a difficult plan to follow

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.690
because you rarely say,
"Let's go out and lose a war."

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.880
But if you wanna lose
a war there's a trick,

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.020
which is start one.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.305
That's like, that'll
usually get you there.

00:14:30.305 --> 00:14:33.540
No, I mean, well, okay,
at least half the time

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.590
it'll get you there.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:39.590
So this may sound slightly
familiar, in 1904,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.156
I have to shorten this a lot, but in 1904,

00:14:42.156 --> 00:14:45.270
the Russian Empire was sure
that it would defeat Japan

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:48.210
because Japan was an Asian country,

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.734
obviously inferior from the
point of view of the Russians.

00:14:51.734 --> 00:14:55.890
So they sent their fleet
all the way around Africa,

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.196
all the way over to Asia

00:14:57.196 --> 00:15:00.090
in order to be sunk by
the Japanese right away.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.890
And they didn't do much better on land,

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.347
they lost the war with
Japan, which set off,

00:15:04.347 --> 00:15:06.690
and the war itself set off protests.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:07.950
So when people talk about

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:10.470
how this war is a risky business for Putin

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.240
this is what they often have in mind,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.060
that Russia lost the
Crimean War and reformed,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.950
that Russia lost the war with Japan,

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.570
and then was forced to reform,

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:20.010
that Russia was about to collapse

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.027
under the weight of the First World War

00:15:21.027 --> 00:15:22.920
and that led to revolution, right?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.120
So when people say like this,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.087
like the Russian state
historically has been,

00:15:26.087 --> 00:15:29.340
has faced pressure during war time,

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.870
these are the examples they have in mind.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.540
The Japanese example's very important.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:35.716
So under the pressure of this defeat

00:15:35.716 --> 00:15:39.750
the Russian state forms a parliament,

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.776
which lasts for a couple of years.

00:15:41.776 --> 00:15:46.290
The restrictions on Ukrainian newspapers

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.826
and publishing houses are released,

00:15:48.826 --> 00:15:51.660
there are student strikes
by Ukrainian students

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:52.830
which lead to the introduction,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.030
over the short term at least,

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.670
of Ukrainian subjects in
universities at Kharkiv

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.920
and then Odessa. Okay?

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.449
So that's the Russian Empire.

00:16:01.449 --> 00:16:04.650
Many, many, many more
Ukrainians than in Galicia.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.017
Much, much more territory.

00:16:06.017 --> 00:16:10.479
The specific forms of Russian
rule, mostly peasant country,

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:12.896
and I should have said this before,

00:16:12.896 --> 00:16:15.000
almost completely illiterate,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.080
which is very important for
national self consciousness.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.197
It's very hard to do national politics

00:16:21.197 --> 00:16:23.160
without the written word, right?

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.210
You can have the printing press,

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:25.507
you can have the political
parties and so on,

00:16:25.507 --> 00:16:27.420
not that Russia had the political parties,

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.500
but you can have all the apparatus,

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.210
but you also need literacy.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.110
In the Habsburg monarchy

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.610
you have much greater rates of literacy

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.020
than the Russian Empire. Okay?

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.940
So, now let's do the Habsburgs,
again, very, very quickly.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:43.470
Circa 1700, the Habsburg's
shift from being a world power

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:46.140
to being a European power.

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:50.070
And the key turning points here are 1526,

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.110
which is unbelievably complicated,

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:53.816
I probably rushed through
it a little bit last time.

00:16:53.816 --> 00:16:56.700
There's a marriage compact,
it's made by this guy,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.987
Wladyslaw Jagiellonczyk, his son,

00:16:58.987 --> 00:17:01.020
who was going to inherit the crowns,

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.297
instead dies under his horse

00:17:02.297 --> 00:17:04.380
at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.200
which allows the son's
brother-in-law, a Habsburg,

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.878
to lay claim to Hungary
and Croatia and so on.

00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:14.878
That claim is eventually realized by 1699,

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.340
the Habsburgs then become a European power

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.946
just at the moment when they
cease to be a world power.

00:17:19.946 --> 00:17:23.610
They're enabled in that
by the Poles in 1683,

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.836
who save Vienna from the Ottomans.

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:29.922
Less than a century later,
1772, the Habsburgs nevertheless

00:17:29.922 --> 00:17:33.120
take part in the first
partition of Poland,

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.610
which gets them this territory of Galicia.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.123
Which is important for us
because Galicia, the Poles call,

00:17:39.123 --> 00:17:42.870
okay, this is like even the TAs

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:44.010
are allowed to answer this one,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.150
what do the Poles refer?

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.582
How do you refer to
that territory in Polish

00:17:47.582 --> 00:17:50.433
in the 18th century?
I'm raising the stakes.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.850
It's like, now there's somebody out there

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.140
who's like watching this on YouTube

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.162
who's tortured because they know

00:17:59.162 --> 00:18:00.870
and they're like in their living room,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.853
raising their hand at the
screen. Ruthenia, right?

00:18:04.853 --> 00:18:08.700
Rus, the Poles said Rus,
they said Czerwona Rus,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.470
they called this Red Ruthenia, right?

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.630
So that word Rus is also in Polish,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:14.693
century, century, centuries
later to designate,

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:18.270
designate Eastern Orthodox territories.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.960
Galicia is the Habsburg
term for these territories.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:25.080
Okay, so the Habsburgs control Galicia,

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.270
they also control a territory
I didn't mention before,

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.995
a smaller territory called Bukovina.

00:18:29.995 --> 00:18:33.904
Bukovina is a mixed at this
time, Ukrainian speaking,

00:18:33.904 --> 00:18:38.010
Yiddish speaking, Romanian
speaking territory.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:39.930
If you've ever, I'm gonna
try to make this familiar

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.763
the best I can.

00:18:40.763 --> 00:18:43.274
If you've ever heard of
the poet, Paul Celan,

00:18:43.274 --> 00:18:46.583
who wrote the most famous
poem about the Holocaust

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:49.302
which is called is called
"Todesfuge", death fugue,

00:18:49.302 --> 00:18:52.950
Celan was from Czernowitz, or Chernivtsi,

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.150
which is the main city in Bukovina.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:57.174
Bukovina is like the,
it's now like the south,

00:18:57.174 --> 00:18:59.280
the southern part of western Ukraine,

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.010
a little bit of the southern
part of western Ukraine.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.050
The point is that Bukovina, like Galicia

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.702
was also under the
Habsburgs, also like Galicia,

00:19:07.702 --> 00:19:09.952
there were politicians,
there were parliamentarians,

00:19:09.952 --> 00:19:11.745
the language was allowed to be used.

00:19:11.745 --> 00:19:13.620
There were newspapers.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.210
All of these things that
I said about Galicia

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:19.140
also apply in lesser measure to Bukovina.

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.990
Now, another thing which I
didn't talk about though enough,

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.739
I made this argument,
which I hope we all got,

00:19:23.739 --> 00:19:28.739
about how secular politics
flourishes in Galicia,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.010
in part because the moment
when the Russian Empire

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:34.470
is most repressive towards
the Ukrainian language,

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:39.470
remember Valuev, Ems, 1863,
1876, is during that moment,

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:43.591
the Habsburg monarchy is
opening up new basic law,

00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:46.350
quasi constitution 1867.

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.410
And so at that moment, these
very intelligent politically,

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:52.620
very sophisticated political intellectuals

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.990
move from the Russian Empire to Galicia

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.810
and stay there for the next
several decades, right?

00:19:57.810 --> 00:19:59.670
But that's all about secular politics

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:02.190
and secular politics
is not the only story.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:06.060
There's also a very
important story in Galicia,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:08.910
which has to do with religion

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:11.670
and with another east
west division, right?

00:20:11.670 --> 00:20:14.220
East west divisions are
like, that's new, right?

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.429
East west divisions are
19th century, 20th century.

00:20:16.429 --> 00:20:18.508
There's an east west division now

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:21.930
in Eastern Christianity, okay?

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.300
So Eastern Christianity, right?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.010
You remember Byzantium,

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:29.850
it's Byzantium that converts Kyiv.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:33.390
Kyiv is the historical center
of Eastern Christianity

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.332
in the world.

00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:36.982
It is where the Metropolitanate,
the Metropolitan sat

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.709
for hundreds of years.

00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:45.709
It was also where orthodox
theology and orthodox thinking,

00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:49.320
along with, along with Chernihiv,

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.900
Kyiv is the place where orthodox thinking,

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:56.089
orthodox theology, orthodox
disputes became very impressive,

00:20:56.089 --> 00:21:00.521
especially in the 17th century.

00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:04.740
And interestingly, this is just,
I mean a fascinating thing,

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.710
which is in the dissertation
of a Yale PhD, actually,

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:11.940
Levgeniia Sakal, I don't
have her name on the sheet,

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.007
but her name is Geniia Sakal.

00:21:13.007 --> 00:21:16.317
But in her PhD she shows
how a lot of the ways

00:21:16.317 --> 00:21:20.160
that the Russian church
now identifies itself

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.160
emerged in the need to carry
out disputes with Kyiv.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:28.530
So in the late 17th century,
I mentioned this earlier,

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.499
in the late 17th century
Kyiv and Chernihiv

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:34.230
are suddenly within Russia

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.210
and in Moscow they have orthodoxy,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.130
but they don't have theology, right?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:40.500
They don't have dispute, they
don't have that tradition.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.810
Whereas in Kyiv, they have a lot of it

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:44.797
because of reformation,
counter reformation,

00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:47.130
renaissance, having to
deal with the Poles,

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.420
having to deal with all of Europe,

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.117
having to deal with all of this mess.

00:21:50.117 --> 00:21:52.380
All possible variations of Protestantism,

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.928
the counter reformation, having
to deal with the Jesuits.

00:21:54.928 --> 00:21:57.000
I mean, probably some of
you went the Jesuit schools,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.620
but having to deal with the
Jesuits always, you know,

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.720
tends to sharpen the mind, right?

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.848
So, I'm gonna get an email about that.

00:22:03.848 --> 00:22:04.681
(students laughing)

00:22:04.681 --> 00:22:08.160
So, but the point is that all of these,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.450
all of this necessity of
disputation over the generations

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.210
meant that Kyiv was a
center of religious dispute

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.740
whereas Moscow was not.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:21.630
In Moscow, they learned to
argue about religion from Kyiv

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:25.112
and they came up with the
arguments which now characterize

00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.060
what they say about the Russian church,

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.491
namely that the Russian church

00:22:28.491 --> 00:22:33.491
is a kind of pure continuation
of Byzantine traditions,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:34.703
blah, blah, blah.

00:22:34.703 --> 00:22:37.380
Which is not true at all.
It's simply not true.

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:39.090
But it's a kind of cool position to take,

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.310
like we are the pure,
unadulterated version

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:43.140
of the way Christianity
was supposed to be.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.360
We got it directly from
Byzantium a thousand years ago

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.101
with this baptism and so on.

00:22:47.101 --> 00:22:49.020
That argument, they made up

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.880
as they were disputing with Kyiv.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.530
And in order to make that argument,

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:55.020
they of course borrowed all
kinds of arguments from Kyiv

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.760
and from Europe, and
they learned languages.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.729
In other words, they became
very sophisticated European,

00:22:58.729 --> 00:23:03.330
you know, theologians in
order to make this argument

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.510
that they weren't sophisticated
European theologians.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.550
So, okay, but that's, anyway, it's really,

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.159
it's an interesting thing about
the Russian church, right?

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:12.810
And all of these stories
about how we are pure,

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.610
and we've been the same
way forever, right?

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.592
Those stories usually emerge
in contact with someone else.

00:23:17.592 --> 00:23:20.782
In fact, they always do,
interestingly enough, Okay?

00:23:20.782 --> 00:23:23.420
So, but so the point here is that

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.940
we also have an east west
division now in Christianity

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.793
because the Metropolitanate in Kyiv,

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:34.050
the center of Eastern Orthodoxy in Kyiv

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:36.400
is gonna be liquidated in 1721.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.150
Kyiv becomes, in a very complicated story,

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.070
subordinate to Moscow.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.300
Moscow takes on the role,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.010
which you're probably familiar with

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:45.781
as the center of Eastern Orthodoxy.

00:23:45.781 --> 00:23:49.699
But meanwhile, there's another church,

00:23:49.699 --> 00:23:54.120
another eastern right
church, which exists,

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.870
but effectively only in
the Habsburg monarchy.

00:23:57.870 --> 00:24:00.432
And that's the church which
is called Greek Catholic,

00:24:00.432 --> 00:24:03.930
or Uniate, U-N-I-A-T-E.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:08.248
It was formed in 1596
by the Union of Brest

00:24:08.248 --> 00:24:10.890
as an attempt to bring all of eastern

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:12.620
and western Christianity together.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:15.210
It failed to do that,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.740
but it succeeded in
creating a third church.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:21.900
So, the people who
stayed with this project

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.560
were called Uniates and they were and are

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.550
characterized by an Eastern rite,

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:33.109
you know, so icons and song, right?

00:24:33.109 --> 00:24:36.930
Whereas, but they were
subordinate to the Pope in Rome.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.670
They're part of the
Catholic Church, right?

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:40.230
The Catholic Church is not the same thing

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:41.820
as the Roman Catholic Church.

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:44.310
Roman Catholics may be
many of the Catholics,

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:46.818
but technically Roman
Catholicism is only one way

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:50.610
to be Catholic and there are
many other ways to be Catholic.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.530
And so the Greek Catholic Church

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:55.380
is inherited by the Habsburgs.

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.930
They actually rename it Greek
Catholic, it's called Uniate.

00:24:57.930 --> 00:24:59.970
They rename it Greek Catholic.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:01.470
They create an academy in Vienna

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.500
to educate these Greek Catholic
priests. Very important.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.880
And then for decades,

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.680
they use the Greek Catholic priests

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.540
as the kind of informal messengers
of small e enlightenment

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.250
in the Galatian countryside.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.420
Spreading literacy,
spreading general knowledge,

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.440
spreading knowledge about politics, right?

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.290
And so that makes the
Habsburgs very different.

00:25:22.290 --> 00:25:25.470
And it creates a tradition which becomes

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.548
a kind of Ukrainian tradition,

00:25:27.548 --> 00:25:30.180
especially thanks to the work of one man

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.057
whose name was Andrei Sheptyts'kyi.

00:25:32.057 --> 00:25:34.920
Andrei Sheptyts'kyi was a
fantastically interesting fellow

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.381
from a Polish aristocratic family

00:25:36.381 --> 00:25:38.999
who converted to both Greek Catholicism,

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:42.000
technically not a conversion,
shifted to Greek Catholicism,

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.130
converted to being Polish,

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.350
okay also not technically a conversion

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.011
but became Polish, right?

00:25:48.011 --> 00:25:51.240
Went from being a Polish
aristocrat, Roman Catholic

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.557
to being a Ukrainian
churchman man of the people

00:25:54.557 --> 00:25:56.460
with great success.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.860
It's a long story, I wish
I had more time for it.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.901
But one of the things
that he succeeded in doing

00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:05.557
was connecting the idea of
the people with the church.

00:26:05.557 --> 00:26:09.210
And the people as a kind of national idea

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.813
with the the Greek Catholic Church. Okay.

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.723
Watch this segue.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.420
At the beginning of the First World War,

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.090
he was abducted by the Russians. Okay?

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.270
It's about, that's as good as
my segue is gonna get here.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:27.480
So he's, so you have to
imagine Sheptyts'kyi,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.980
so you already have in your mind, right,

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.800
that there are these secular
Ukrainian politicians

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.780
who are operating the 1880s, 1890s.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:35.220
And you have to think alongside that

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:37.268
there's also this Greek Catholic church,

00:26:37.268 --> 00:26:39.540
which is headed by this man Sheptyts'kyi,

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.690
which is becoming more
Ukrainian by the year.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:43.920
That's important too.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.870
Both the secular part
and the religious part

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.730
of the national movement
in Galicia are important.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.530
And they're both different as you see,

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.900
significantly from what's
happening in the Russian Empire.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.090
Russian empire, more
important, more Ukrainians,

00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:58.560
will always end up being more important,

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.109
but they're these
specificities about Galicia,

00:27:00.109 --> 00:27:02.820
which we have to know. Okay.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.138
So this brings us to,

00:27:04.138 --> 00:27:06.480
now I'll do it entirely without a segue.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.318
This brings us to the First World War.

00:27:08.318 --> 00:27:12.183
Very briefly, what was
the First World War?

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.910
This is not one of these questions

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:16.500
where I'm gonna make you answer.

00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:18.960
The First World War was
a kind of sorting out

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.520
of European empires.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.855
So if you think back
to the earlier lecture

00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:25.350
about the four or 500 years of empire

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:27.840
where I was trying to just
establish the basic principles

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.730
and realities of European empire.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:31.200
The First World war was the moment

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.780
when basically the countries
which governed the planet,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:36.300
ruled the planet, decided
to have a terrible war

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.580
on the tiny bit of
territory they were from,

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.290
kill each other on the scale of millions,

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:41.250
and then tens of millions

00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:43.140
and then see what would happen, right?

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.150
That's the First World War.

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.370
If you think about it, it's like

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.990
if you were looking at
the history of earth

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.150
or the history of humans
from an alien point of view,

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.250
there would admittedly
be many strange moments,

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.350
but this moment is one
of the stranger ones.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.150
I mean, you have a handful of countries

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:59.901
who are profiting from
ruling the rest of the world.

00:27:59.901 --> 00:28:02.640
Economic growth is
actually doing quite well.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.460
The first globalization
is basically a big success

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.480
for the Europeans.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.790
And nevertheless, they
decide to fight each other

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:09.960
and kill each other for four years

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:11.730
with the most modern
weapons they can think of

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:13.440
over trenches, right?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.880
That's the First World War.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.782
So the First World War is a
kind of sorting out of empires

00:28:17.782 --> 00:28:19.590
in which, I can't tell the whole story,

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.975
but in which by the end,

00:28:20.975 --> 00:28:24.750
the maritime empires are winning,

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:28.110
France, Britain, the United States

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.500
and the land empires are losing.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.141
And this is despite the fact,

00:28:33.141 --> 00:28:35.734
this is despite the fact
that the land empires

00:28:35.734 --> 00:28:37.740
weren't all on the same side.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.190
So the Russian empire loses

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:43.470
in the sense that it falls apart in 1917,

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.000
the Russian Empire was on the side

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.980
of the French and the British.

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.300
The Ottoman Empire falls apart,

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.490
the German empire falls
apart, the Austrian empire,

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.022
the Habsburgs all fall apart.

00:28:52.022 --> 00:28:56.727
They are allies, the
Habsburgs, the Germans

00:28:56.727 --> 00:29:01.727
and the Ottomans, they
lose, they fall apart.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.920
So, the basic story here
is the story of a kind of

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.490
sorting out of empires.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.452
Now, the interesting question here,

00:29:11.452 --> 00:29:15.093
just like if you were gonna write an exam,

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.420
well, maybe not for this class,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:21.065
but something to think about is this,

00:29:21.065 --> 00:29:23.970
this is what historians ask,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.777
in the 19th century they asked,

00:29:25.777 --> 00:29:27.840
"Did the Habsburgs have to fall apart

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.040
because of nationalism?" And
basically everybody said yes.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.580
Then a 150 years later,
people ask the same question

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.864
and they basically, they say no.

00:29:36.864 --> 00:29:39.030
So, it's something to think about, right?

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:40.770
There's good evidence on both sides.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:44.190
But was the nation state a result

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.890
of some kind of long national trajectory

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:49.140
and the First World War
just sort of an occasion?

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:52.590
Or was it rather that entities
like the Habsburg monarchy

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.990
could have trundled
along for a while longer,

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:57.420
but the First World War was
such a horrible cataclysm

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.838
that it broke them apart
and then nation states

00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:02.550
emerged as kind of a default alternative,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.750
which weren't really that interesting

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.100
just nobody could think
of anything else. Okay.

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:09.630
So in the Ukrainian question,

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:12.523
I'm gonna be specific
about this for a minute.

00:30:12.523 --> 00:30:17.523
The Habsburgs, oh, we can't have this,

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.430
we can't do this without
Franz Ferdinand. Okay.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.580
So Franz Ferdinand, he's
in love, he marries,

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.510
you know who Franz Ferdinand is,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.590
he's the heir to the throne.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.580
He's the heir to the Habsburg throne.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.560
He's not the monarch, he's
the heir to the throne.

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.000
He falls in love.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.957
He's in love with somebody
who's of lower status.

00:30:31.957 --> 00:30:33.147
They're in Vienna.

00:30:33.147 --> 00:30:36.000
They can't even like walk
together holding hands

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.160
because of procession protocol.

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.683
She's all the way back
here. It's very awkward.

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:45.930
Not making any yell jokes at
all right now, in the least.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:49.020
So in order for him to be
together with his wife,

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.593
who he loves, he goes to Sarajevo.

00:30:51.593 --> 00:30:55.080
In Sarajevo, they can ride
around in a car in public

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.420
and sit together in the front
seat, which is very nice.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.375
Everybody loves it,
especially if the car is open.

00:30:59.375 --> 00:31:00.677
But if the car is open,

00:31:00.677 --> 00:31:04.200
that makes it a lot easier for
the young university students

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.240
who happen to be Serbian nationalists

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.620
to throw bombs at them.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:09.480
Which in fact is what happens.

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:13.830
Serbia at this time is making
claims to Bosnia Herzegovina,

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:15.570
which is the last European territory

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.306
which Serbia doesn't have that might want.

00:31:17.306 --> 00:31:20.520
And as a result, an organization
called The Black Hand,

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.410
I know it sounds like I'm
making this all up, but I'm not.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:23.460
This is how it actually happened.

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.990
An organization called the Black Hand

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.387
recruits Serbian students inside
Bosnia, so inside Austria,

00:31:28.387 --> 00:31:32.730
one of them was a fellow
called Gavrilo Princip.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:36.299
At the moment when the
procession was riding by

00:31:36.299 --> 00:31:41.130
a bomb was thrown, it bounced
off the hood of the car

00:31:41.130 --> 00:31:44.100
and it exploded somewhere
else. Other people were hurt.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.050
The couple was fine.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.850
Franz Ferdinand goes to the hospital,

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.410
visits the people who are wounded.

00:31:49.410 --> 00:31:51.750
Coming back from the
hospital, his driver gets lost

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:52.956
stops to ask for directions.

00:31:52.956 --> 00:31:56.310
One of the Serbian national
students is sitting in a cafe

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.140
drinking because he's missed his chance

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.670
to assassinate Franz Ferdinand.

00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:02.550
He looks up, there's Franz
Ferdinand, shoots him dead.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.833
That's how we get the
First World War. Okay?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.950
Just like when you're in political science

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.060
and international relations

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.258
and they're telling you
about the structures

00:32:10.258 --> 00:32:14.460
and like, just remember
that, just remember that,

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.293
remember that story.

00:32:15.293 --> 00:32:16.470
'Cause that's like the First World War

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.090
is the most important thing
that happened in the world

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.470
in the 20th century.

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.870
And if like Franz Ferdinand
doesn't go to the hospital

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.836
to visit the wounded and
the driver doesn't get lost,

00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:26.220
probably no First World War. Okay.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.497
So, but the point then, I had a point

00:32:28.497 --> 00:32:31.080
and the point is that
the Habsburg monarchy

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.873
begins the First World
War by attacking Serbia.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.610
But the very next part of the
First World War is in Galicia

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.880
because Russia comes in
on the side of Serbia

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.140
and then everyone comes in, right?

00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.150
Then France comes in with Russia

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:46.826
and Germany comes in
on the side of Austria.

00:32:46.826 --> 00:32:50.430
But for our class, what's
important is Russia comes in

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.850
on the side of Serbia and
invades right away Galicia,

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:56.100
invades Galicia right
away, September of 1914.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:00.993
Takes it, treats it as part
of one of the United Russia.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.683
Oh, and they take, Okay, Sheptyts'kyi,

00:33:04.683 --> 00:33:05.700
that was my segue.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.497
Sheptyts'kyi along with
the hundreds of other

00:33:07.497 --> 00:33:11.400
Greek Catholic priests, gets
exiled deep into Russia.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:16.400
The Habsburgs then take
Galicia back in May of 1915.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:20.640
And in 1917, the Habsburgs are
able to go on the offensive

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.750
along with their German allies

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.750
and take much of what
is now Ukraine. Okay.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:28.357
How are they able to do that? Lenin, okay?

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:32.970
So there's a reason why this theme,

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.400
there are many reasons
why this theme of empire

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.210
is so important in this class.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.040
One of them is that you can't understand

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.150
the Bolshevik Revolution

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.830
or why anybody thought it could happen

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:42.890
without a concept of world empire.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:47.108
Lenin thought that Marx was right.

00:33:47.108 --> 00:33:49.023
You guys know about Karl Marx, right?

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.433
I'm sorry, Thank you.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:57.030
So Lenin thought that Marx was right,

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:59.130
that capitalism had created

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.740
this kind of homogenizing monster,

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.890
which went around the
world, flattening cultures,

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:08.890
turning social groups into classes,

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:11.239
making everything basically
the same everywhere,

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:15.030
leading to a tension between
workers and property owners.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:18.840
Lenin thought that was all
correct, but, said Lenin,

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.228
and this is a really
interesting move, says Lenin,

00:34:22.228 --> 00:34:24.900
"Marx thinks we have to have a revolution

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.150
where there are lots of
workers in factories,"

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:30.810
but, says Lenin, "Marx also
says that the whole thing

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:32.338
is one big world system.

00:34:32.338 --> 00:34:35.829
So if it's one big world system
and we're revolutionaries,

00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:38.790
we are therefore allowed
and indeed required

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:41.820
to push wherever the
capitalists are weakest."

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.400
And how do you know where
the capitalists are weakest?

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.920
You push and you find out, right?

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.730
And applying that logic in 1917,

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.100
it was acceptable for
Lenin and his Bolsheviks

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:56.790
to try to overthrow the
existing order in Russia.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.350
Russia at that time,
from the point of view

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:00.480
of the Marxists themselves was backward.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.130
It was a country of peasants and nomads.

00:35:02.130 --> 00:35:03.870
There were very few workers.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:06.600
Marx did not think there would
be a revolution in Russia.

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.640
But with this argument, you could say,

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.846
well, Russia's part of the world's system,

00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:14.910
if it's a weak point, then
we're allowed to push on it.

00:35:14.910 --> 00:35:17.023
And then, here comes the
next very important thing,

00:35:17.023 --> 00:35:19.920
we'll be like, it's like a powder keg.

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.700
We start the revolution and
then the English and the Germans

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.110
and all the more advanced comrades

00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:26.280
will have their revolutions

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:28.260
and then they'll come and rescue us.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.000
So the people who made
the Russian Revolution

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.920
never intended to make
a Russian revolution

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.750
they intended to make a world revolution.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:35.310
They believed that what they were doing

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.713
was starting a world revolution.

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:40.980
How does Lenin, okay,
how does this guy Lenin,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.813
I mean, what is?

00:35:41.813 --> 00:35:43.650
Lenin is like drinking
coffee in, you know,

00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.840
he's drinking coffee in Zurich
during the First World War,

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.130
which is a perfectly, you know, reason,

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.351
well, Zurich's kind of boring,

00:35:48.351 --> 00:35:50.790
but it's a perfectly
reasonable thing to do.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.383
What does he, how does he get?

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.310
So the German, again
this is not quite as good

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:57.360
as the Franz Ferdinand story,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.770
but it's still worth knowing

00:35:58.770 --> 00:35:59.760
when you wanna think about,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.680
like, if someone's telling
you it's all about structures

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:05.191
and things have to be the way
they are and be a realist.

00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:08.700
So, Lenin's drinking coffee,
the foreign minister of Germany

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.100
is a man called Arthur Zimmerman,

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.483
like Zimmerman, Zimmerman.

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.605
He convinces the German
emperor, the Kaiser,

00:36:16.605 --> 00:36:20.550
that this fellow Lenin can
disrupt the war effort.

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.280
And the Germans arrange
for this fellow Lenin

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.183
to be transported across
Germany, into the Russian,

00:36:27.183 --> 00:36:32.183
into Russia in April of 1917,
famously in a sealed train,

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:33.323
whatever that means.

00:36:33.323 --> 00:36:35.340
I don't think the train was
actually physically sealed.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.258
It's just like once you hear
the phrase sealed train,

00:36:37.258 --> 00:36:38.700
it sounds cool.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.800
And so it like survives
and the historiography

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.730
down to this day.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.350
But that train was not physically sealed.

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:45.630
Like people got off, they got
on, they went to the bathroom,

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:48.960
they bought snacks, you
know, but you get the idea.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.030
They put Lenin on the train,
he didn't get out the train

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.340
until they got to Russia.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.516
By this time, the Russian
State had already collapsed.

00:36:56.516 --> 00:37:00.480
The Tzar had already abdicated.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.967
There had already been one revolution,

00:37:01.967 --> 00:37:04.344
a kind of undefined revolution.

00:37:04.344 --> 00:37:07.455
What Lenin succeeded in doing
was turning this revolution,

00:37:07.455 --> 00:37:10.590
which had led to a provisional government

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.500
into a new form of revolution
in November of 1917.

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.760
It's called the October Revolution

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:17.250
because of the different
datings, Julian and Gregorian.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.616
But it actually happened in November,

00:37:18.616 --> 00:37:20.220
just like the previous revolution,

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:21.437
which is called the February Revolution

00:37:21.437 --> 00:37:25.260
from the western point of
view happened in March.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.310
Lenin made this revolution

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.590
because he believed he
was allowed to do so

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:31.620
because of his own ideas
about globalization, right?

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.780
Ideas matter quite a lot.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.550
As tactics, it turned out not to be bad,

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.270
they did manage to make a revolution.

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:41.070
And in their revolution,

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.740
they entered into a larger conversation,

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.040
which was going on about
what happens after empire,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:49.687
in which everybody gave the same answer

00:37:49.687 --> 00:37:54.390
and they were all insincere,
but in slightly different ways.

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:55.530
The answer to the question,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.120
what you do after empire?

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.550
Is national self-determination, right?

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.640
So this is why the imperial
background is so important here,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.680
because then there's this big question of,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.080
okay, empires fall and they break,

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.180
and then what do you do next?

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.090
Lenin, with Stalin actually,

00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:14.910
has been working on this
problem, and he has the answer.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.107
The answer is national self-determination.

00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:19.920
"Every nation" says Lenin "has the right

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.540
to its own sovereign existence, unless",

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.137
it's a pretty big unless,

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:29.280
"unless such aspirations
interfere with the class struggle"

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.170
in which case, no. Right?

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.566
And this is a very important, you know,

00:38:33.566 --> 00:38:35.880
this is a very important solution,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.630
It like, it runs through the
whole Soviet project actually,

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:43.050
that we declaratively, we
accept that nations are real

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.880
and we declaratively support them

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:46.080
but we're always gonna be trying

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.350
to use those national
energies in ways that suit us.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.490
But if they don't suit us,

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.530
i.e. they're not consistent
with the class struggle,

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.930
it's the same thing, then
we're allowed to crush them.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.490
We're allowed to starve them,
we're allowed to have terror,

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.170
whatever it might be. Okay?

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:01.463
So that's, so Lenin is saying, yeah,

00:39:01.463 --> 00:39:04.260
national self-determination,
Poland, Ukraine, Finland,

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.450
you know, whatever, it's all fine.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.140
Meanwhile, at the same
time in the United States,

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.766
the Americans are also talking about

00:39:11.766 --> 00:39:14.460
national self-determination.

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.500
When the Americans come
into the First World War,

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.810
the ideological cover which is given,

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:21.270
and an argument from principle
had to be made in America

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.550
for why there could be a war,

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.286
was for national self-determination.

00:39:25.286 --> 00:39:27.794
But the American idea of
national self-determination

00:39:27.794 --> 00:39:30.600
was basically limited to Poland

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.910
and to countries of the Habsburg monarchy.

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.603
And it's tactical design
was to break apart

00:39:35.603 --> 00:39:38.217
the Habsburg monarchy.

00:39:38.217 --> 00:39:40.800
So notoriously,

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.390
and it's notorious because the Japanese

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.514
actually brought this up later
and made a thing about it,

00:39:44.514 --> 00:39:47.790
notoriously, Wilsonian self-determination

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.130
did not apply beyond Europe.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.920
But, for the purposes of
this class, you should note

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.680
that it also didn't apply
to everywhere in Europe.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.560
So it did not apply to Ukraine.

00:39:58.560 --> 00:39:59.670
Nobody was making the argument

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:02.322
for national
self-determination for Ukraine

00:40:02.322 --> 00:40:07.322
on the Entente side, but on
the other side they were.

00:40:09.096 --> 00:40:11.730
The Germans, meanwhile, right?

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.737
So isn't it really, it's
interesting how like

00:40:13.737 --> 00:40:15.630
national self-determination,

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.730
like it seems like it would be somebody's,

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:18.990
like, it's just Wilson's idea.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:19.950
Maybe it's just Lenin's idea,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.070
but actually it was everybody's idea.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.080
It was just a question
of how it was applied.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.943
So in 1917, when the Bolshevik Revolution

00:40:28.943 --> 00:40:32.782
breaks the Russian Empire and
the Germans then experience

00:40:32.782 --> 00:40:37.500
terrific battlefield
success on the eastern front

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.200
because the Russian revolution
has just taken place

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.250
and they push all the
way deep into Ukraine,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:48.210
Belarus the Baltics, and
they sign a peace treaty

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.230
with the Ukrainian National
Republic in February of 1918,

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.030
they do this according to the principle

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.890
of national self-determination.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.980
They say, look, no one else
is recognizing you Ukrainians,

00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.752
but we recognize you because we believe

00:41:00.752 --> 00:41:03.750
in national self-determination.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.280
The Bolsheviks are obviously just joking,

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.904
the Americans don't care, but
look at us, we recognize you.

00:41:07.904 --> 00:41:12.630
But that agreement, the
treaty of Brest-Litovsk,

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.630
February, 1918 is contingent
upon something very important,

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:22.260
which is Ukraine delivers
millions and millions

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.190
of tons of food stuffs to
Germany immediately. Okay?

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:28.710
So it's a peculiar kind of
national self-determination

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.480
where you're not actually
determining, for example,

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.790
your own trade policy,
your own economic policy

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:34.170
because the first thing you have to do

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:36.960
is you have to give all of your
food to Germany and Austria.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:39.612
Now, if we can just get
the timing of the war right

00:41:39.612 --> 00:41:41.730
we'll be in business.

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.073
This is early 1918, the
Germans and the Austrians

00:41:45.073 --> 00:41:47.220
are winning on the eastern front

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.050
because of the Russian Revolution.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.123
Meanwhile though, the Americans
have entered the war, 1917,

00:41:53.123 --> 00:41:54.720
the Americans are gonna bring,

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.783
and this is a formidable number,

00:41:55.783 --> 00:41:59.490
a million men to fight in Europe.

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.513
The Germans make a last ditch attempt

00:42:01.513 --> 00:42:03.507
to defeat the Americans, the British

00:42:03.507 --> 00:42:05.220
and the French on the western front

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:08.910
and their idea is they're gonna
do it with Ukrainian food.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:09.870
That's the idea.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:12.030
The Ukrainian food is
gonna make this possible.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:16.080
So they make the effort,
they mount a huge offensive

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.290
in late summer of 1918 and they lose

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:21.900
and the First World War comes to an end.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:25.454
Or, so this is famous, if you
study west European history,

00:42:25.454 --> 00:42:30.270
11th hour of the 11th day
of the 11th month of 1918,

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.670
the guns fall silent, the war is over.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.860
A new chapter in French
and German history begins,

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.970
et cetera.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.860
But if you're studying Eastern Europe,

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.170
like the fighting just continues.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:43.740
It just continues for another
several years after that.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.230
And because you're in this power vacuum,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.510
there's been a revolution
in Russia and there's chaos.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.490
The Germans who had
been dominant are just,

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.990
they pull back, right?

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:54.030
And then suddenly what's going to happen?

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:56.471
And what happens, and you have
to read about this in detail

00:42:56.471 --> 00:42:58.830
in the reading because it's just too much

00:42:58.830 --> 00:42:59.940
for me to get into here.

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:04.913
But what happens here
is that in this chaos,

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.130
two Ukrainian states are formed.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:09.672
Two Ukrainian states are formed.

00:43:09.672 --> 00:43:12.720
According to different logics,

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.860
which are themselves dependent
upon the different empires.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.660
Within the Russian Empire,

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.150
there's something called the
Ukrainian National Council,

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.580
which is largely young people,

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:28.560
sometimes very young and
largely educated people,

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:29.820
intellectuals, but the Ukrainian National,

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.950
oh, and the Chair of the
Ukrainian National Council,

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:33.562
so the defacto president or head of state

00:43:33.562 --> 00:43:35.310
is Mykhailo Hrushevsky.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.680
So the historian, the person who wrote

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.608
this kind of social history of Ukraine.

00:43:39.608 --> 00:43:41.776
I don't know whether this is true,

00:43:41.776 --> 00:43:44.220
but supposedly while he was basically

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.150
the president of the country,

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.950
he would take his phone off
the hook in the mornings

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:49.320
'cause he needed to do his reading.

00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.110
Which again, I don't know
if it's true, but it's like,

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:53.100
it's a lovely thought.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.464
Like I kind of wish I, you
know, like wouldn't it be cool?

00:43:55.464 --> 00:43:56.673
Like if you were the President,

00:43:56.673 --> 00:43:58.530
but no, I actually have
to finish my, you know,

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:00.660
I gotta do my historical work. Okay?

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.390
You guys are not as
seduced by this as I am.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:05.670
So there's Ukrainian National Council,

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:08.965
which as the situation in the
Russian empire radicalizes

00:44:08.965 --> 00:44:11.160
itself takes more radical positions

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.110
until it finds itself
basically backed into

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:16.230
declaring full national
independence with the so-called

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.083
Fourth Universal in early 1918.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.330
Meanwhile, there is also
a different progression

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.840
in the Habsburg monarchy,
where the state is functioning

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.790
till the, really till the very end.

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:31.860
But the moment the state is over,

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:34.175
Ukrainian soldiers and
Ukrainian bureaucrats

00:44:34.175 --> 00:44:38.220
immediately declare the night,
actually right around now,

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:40.770
the last night of October to
the first day of November,

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:42.630
they declare a west
Ukrainian National Republic

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.330
with a capital in Lviv, fly the flag,

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.224
declare that they exist

00:44:46.224 --> 00:44:50.580
and immediately begins
a war with the Poles.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.463
And the Ukrainians do okay
in this war with the Poles

00:44:52.463 --> 00:44:55.770
until essentially the
whole Polish army shows up,

00:44:55.770 --> 00:45:00.770
or in particular an army of Poles,

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.550
I know the First World War, it's a mess,

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.510
but an army of Poles who
had been prisoners of war

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:08.640
from the Russian Empire, right?

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.860
'Cause most of Poland is
in the Russian Empire.

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.760
So Poles who were taken prisoner,

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:16.130
Poles from the Russian empire,

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.423
Poles from all over the place.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:23.763
Poles end up fighting,

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:26.760
so it's a much bigger country, right?

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.024
And the Polish army,

00:45:28.024 --> 00:45:30.300
when it gets rid of
its other distractions,

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.970
is able to concentrate
its force in Galicia.

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.800
Where they basically,
you know, so all in all,

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.660
Poland out numbers Galicia by a lot.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.310
So the West Ukrainian National Republic

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:40.470
lasts for about half a year.

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:42.990
But the West Ukrainian army

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.963
is still the best
Ukrainian army in the field

00:45:44.963 --> 00:45:48.060
because the, you know, not
to be too blunt about it,

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.040
but because, I will be blunt,

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.200
because the left wing, you know,

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:57.200
is basically like PhD
student, sorry, intellectuals

00:45:57.385 --> 00:46:00.150
who ran the Ukrainian National Republic,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:04.350
they were not so big on
administration and the army, right?

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.900
There were other reasons
too, but they didn't,

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.090
their first priority was
not setting up an army,

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:10.620
it took 'em a while to figure that out.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.465
So when the West Ukrainians
lose and they move east

00:46:13.465 --> 00:46:17.940
which is the middle of
1918, sorry, middle of 1919,

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.130
they're still the most important
Ukrainian fighting force

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:21.750
in the field.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.230
They find themselves

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.190
in this incredibly complicated situation

00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:31.190
because in 1918 to 1919
the territory of Ukraine

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:35.970
is being contested by a Ukrainian State

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.340
which has gone through
various permutations,

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:39.876
which I'm gonna have
to let you read about,

00:46:39.876 --> 00:46:42.930
but which slowly builds up its own army,

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.800
its own army is very
confederated and disorganized

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.560
and generally run by local warlords,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:51.540
many of whom carry out terrible,

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.880
terrible mass killings of Jews,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.860
that's part of this history as well,

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:56.850
and it's part of the
history that the reading

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:57.780
doesn't do a good job with,

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.240
and I'm gonna assign some more reading.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:03.330
Another contestant is the Red Army,

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.640
which invades Ukraine not once, not twice,

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:08.070
but three times before
it finally succeeds.

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.320
And then there's another contestant,

00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.510
which is the so-called White Army,

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.030
which means the pro restoration

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.465
of Russian Empire Army, right?

00:47:17.465 --> 00:47:20.010
And there's the Poles.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.556
So the Whites, the Reds and Ukrainians

00:47:22.556 --> 00:47:24.330
fight it out in Ukraine.

00:47:24.330 --> 00:47:25.635
And you can see how difficult, I mean,

00:47:25.635 --> 00:47:27.150
apart from anything else,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:28.830
the fact that you're fighting the Red Army

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:29.663
and the White Army

00:47:29.663 --> 00:47:32.040
and the Reds and the Whites
are fighting on your territory,

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.260
it's a very complicated situation.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.060
And the murders of the Jews

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.450
have a great deal to do with that chaos.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:44.450
But, so by the end of
1918, by the end of 1919,

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.240
the Ukrainians have basically lost,

00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.400
the Reds have basically won,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.873
and then the Poles intervene.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.090
So, and this is just,

00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:55.560
that's just an interesting
thing to think about.

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.860
Like we're now a hundred years on

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.670
and there's another war in Ukraine

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.560
and the Poles are not intervening.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.270
Like as a historian, I always think,

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.950
I mean like you guys
all think this is normal

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:07.170
because like Poland is just
a normal bourgeois country

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.270
and of course they would, but you know,

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:10.800
that's a very recent development.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.220
Like the Poland that exists today,

00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.980
where the life expectancy
is longer than in America.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:18.562
And the roads are much, much
better than American roads.

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:21.240
That's only existed
for a few years, right?

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.870
So the historical Poland is a much more

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.191
east European country,

00:48:25.191 --> 00:48:28.712
deeply involved in Belarus,
deeply involved in Ukraine.

00:48:28.712 --> 00:48:31.248
But anyway, just the
very last thought here.

00:48:31.248 --> 00:48:36.248
In late 1919, the Poles agree to ally

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.300
with the remnants of the Ukrainian Army

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.300
for one last attempt to take Ukraine,

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.479
and they succeed for a while.

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:48.570
In May of 1920, they capture Kyiv,

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:51.390
the Poles then do a very
characteristically Polish thing,

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:54.040
which let's face it, it's kind of cool.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.570
They take their, so
the main avenue in Kyiv

00:48:57.570 --> 00:48:58.923
is called Khreshchatyk.

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:03.150
At the end of it is the thing
which is now called Maidan.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:05.280
So what the Poles did
after they arrived in Kyiv,

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.887
was they took all their calvary

00:49:06.887 --> 00:49:10.050
and they marched it down
Khreshchatyk, very impressive.

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:12.660
And then they like went
around the block a few blocks,

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.070
came back and made a circle.

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:16.980
So it looked like they had just
like these endless, endless,

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.899
endless troops invading Ukraine,

00:49:18.899 --> 00:49:21.330
which they didn't in fact.

00:49:21.330 --> 00:49:24.410
And they were quickly driven
back out by the Bolsheviks.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:27.431
By August of 1920 the Red Army

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:30.390
was actually in the suburbs of Warsaw,

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.280
which was defended by the Polish Army,

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.930
but also by the Ukrainians,

00:49:33.930 --> 00:49:36.343
which is why if you visit
the Polish military cemetery

00:49:36.343 --> 00:49:39.990
in Warsaw there will be
quite a few Ukrainian graves,

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:42.450
which would be otherwise mysterious.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.030
At the end of all that and
now we really are at the end,

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:46.440
at the end of all of that,

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.990
it will be Poland and the Soviet Union

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.480
which sign a treaty at Riga.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.140
And that treaty will create
a new east west division,

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.910
but again, east west division,

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:00.570
where Galicia and another
territory called Volhynia

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:02.114
are gonna be part of Poland

00:50:02.114 --> 00:50:04.440
and the rest of what's now Ukraine

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:06.560
is gonna become part of the Soviet Union.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.020
So I've taken you as far as
I can take you this time,

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.520
I realize this is hard going.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:13.170
I appreciate you guys paying attention

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:15.300
and we'll pick up again on Thursday.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.133
Thanks.

00:50:20.254 --> 00:50:22.837
(gentle music)

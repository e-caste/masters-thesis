00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.672
Professor David Blight:
Reconstruction is that period of

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:11.246
American history that I think
still--I know still--is

00:00:11.246 --> 00:00:15.027
short-shrifted in the ways
people tend to learn American

00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:19.750
history in this society,
for whatever the reasons.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.506
Part of the reason may be that
it's messy and complicated,

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:25.360
and part of the reason may be
that it's full of violence,

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.278
and part of the reason may be
that it's just not as easy to

00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:34.442
find good heroes,
and part of the reason may be

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:38.050
that it comes after such a
total, all out,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.240
and some may say,
in so many ways a glorious war.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.154
Or as Kenneth Stampp,
a great historian,

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:49.968
once put it,
until 1865 there was glory

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:54.785
enough to go around,
but after 1865 where was the

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.745
glory?
It's also been a period in

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:01.661
which we've almost insisted--and
I wonder just how you have

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:05.703
learned about this before;
if this were a smaller class I

00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:09.176
would ask you--but it's as
though our culture still

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.469
insists,
from this period of our

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:19.290
history, that it be a melodrama,
some kind of melodrama with,

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.750
well, a sufficient number of
heroes and a sufficient number

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.875
of villains, and a melodrama
that usually ends up with a

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:36.830
story of an oppressed South,
much in need of our sympathy.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.090
Now, I've put a piece of words
up here in front of you.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.950
I walked back to see if you
could read it.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.650
I do think most of you in the
room can read it.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.950
Just hold onto the papers until
the end, please.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.550
This is the Thirteenth
Amendment.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.286
We're going to look at the
Thirteenth and the Fourteenth

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:02.519
today, or at least I'll get you
up to the Fourteenth Amendment.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.605
If the Civil War and
Reconstruction were a second

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.180
founding--and I'll put the "if"
on that,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.673
although for the next three
weeks I'm going to argue

00:02:13.673 --> 00:02:16.139
that--if it was a second
founding,

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:21.333
a second revolution of some
kind, that second founding is in

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.648
the Thirteenth,
the Fourteenth,

00:02:23.648 --> 00:02:26.160
the Fifteenth Amendments to the
Constitution.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.996
Read the Thirteenth with me.
It's the simplest,

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:32.274
shortest--other than the actual
parts of the Bill of

00:02:32.274 --> 00:02:35.873
Rights--it's the simplest,
shortest amendment in the U.S.

00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:38.531
Constitution.
It outlaws slavery and

00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:41.875
involuntary servitude,
except for imprisonment for

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:45.822
crime.
And then it has that very,

00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:52.614
very simple Section Two:
"Congress shall have power to

00:02:52.614 --> 00:02:59.150
enforce this article by
appropriate legislation.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.905
That is almost,
in some ways,

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:07.219
a prÃ©cis for what
Reconstruction will become.

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:15.953
What will constitute
appropriate legislation to

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:22.162
enforce black freedom?
I put it up today in part,

00:03:22.162 --> 00:03:25.466
too, because just this weekend
I was out lecturing in

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:28.745
Springfield,
Illinois at the new Abraham

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:33.460
Lincoln Presidential Library;
and it's a magnificent place if

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.139
you haven't been there.
It's a museum full of lots of

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.139
wax figures.
There's at least one life size

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.319
wax of Lincoln in every bloody
room, sometimes two of them,

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.920
and then they use holograms and
he appears all over the place.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.085
It's a little weird and scary.
But at the end of the whole day

00:03:53.085 --> 00:03:58.690
and evening they took me down in
the vault and asked me if I

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.155
wanted to see some special
documents and special

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:06.836
possessions.
They showed me one of Lincoln's

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:10.436
three existing top hats,
they showed me the cast of his

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:13.469
hand;
I got to touch.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:20.706
They showed me personal notes
he wrote to pardon deserters

00:04:20.706 --> 00:04:25.906
from the Union Army.
They showed me all kinds of

00:04:25.906 --> 00:04:28.539
things.
But one of the things they

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.747
showed me was the original
draft, the handwritten draft by

00:04:32.747 --> 00:04:36.069
the clerk of the House of
Representatives,

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:40.803
of the Thirteenth Amendment,
and then signed by "A.

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:45.063
Lincoln" and most of the
members of the House,

00:04:45.063 --> 00:04:48.850
at least those who chose to
sign it.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:55.259
And I realized,
"damn, that thing is real."

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.660
And maybe someday I can live to
see the Fourteenth Amendment.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.850
Back to the Fourteenth in a
moment.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.879
Sorry about that,
that's not the Fourteenth

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.430
Amendment, that's just the
outline.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.682
Now, a few overall thoughts on
Reconstruction,

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:22.447
to just give you some hooks to
hang your hat on before we look

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:28.589
back again at this question of
Reconstruction during the war,

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.370
and then after Lincoln's death
the fight that ensues,

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.060
quickly, between the new
president,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.853
Andrew Johnson,
and the Congressional

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:42.508
leadership that the Republican
Party--soon now to be known as

00:05:42.508 --> 00:05:46.543
the Radical Republicans--and
what will become a great

00:05:46.543 --> 00:05:51.276
constitutional crisis over who
will control Reconstruction and

00:05:51.276 --> 00:05:55.605
what Reconstruction will be.
Reconstruction,

00:05:55.605 --> 00:06:00.827
though, is often seen--it is
indeed an era of almost

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:06.040
gargantuan aspirations,
if you think about what they

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.139
were trying to achieve,
and tragic failures.

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:16.207
But it's also an era of sudden
and unprecedented legal,

00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:20.589
political, and constitutional
change.

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.518
It's also a period of
tremendous social and political

00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:26.709
violence.
We've never experienced

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:29.428
anything in America--other than
sanctioned war,

00:06:29.428 --> 00:06:32.680
which the Civil War of course
had been--we've never,

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.111
ever experienced social and
political violence on the scale

00:06:36.111 --> 00:06:38.300
which you'll see in
Reconstruction.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.389
In fact there's a whole batch
of books coming out now on

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.797
Reconstruction violence,
and I suspect this has a lot to

00:06:44.797 --> 00:06:47.310
do with living in the age of
terrorism;

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.870
publishers are really promoting
the subject.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.054
You're reading one of them
that's just been out a year or

00:06:54.054 --> 00:06:57.790
two by Nicholas Lemann called
Redemption.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.514
More on that in a week or two.
In another way,

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:06.992
Reconstruction was one long,
ten, eleven year agonizing

00:07:06.992 --> 00:07:10.310
referendum on the meaning of the
war.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.756
What had the war meant?
That's what Reconstruction was

00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:17.552
trying to explain,
trying to settle,

00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:19.150
trying to codify.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.029
What had actually been the
verdict at Appomattox?

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:32.305
When Lee surrendered and then
Johnston surrendered and the

00:07:32.305 --> 00:07:36.280
Confederate Army surrendered,
what was the verdict?

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:43.076
Who got to determine it?
Who had really won the war,

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:50.180
and what had they won?
What cause had lost?

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.770
Now, someone really won this
war and someone really lost this

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.538
war.
This is not one of those wars

00:07:55.538 --> 00:07:57.821
where you can say,
"You know, nobody ever wins a

00:07:57.821 --> 00:08:00.829
war."
Nonsense.

00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:05.829
Union victory is real,
Confederate defeat was

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:10.260
virtually total,
in a military sense.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:16.788
But what was the South to lose?
One of the greatest challenges

00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:20.236
of Reconstruction was to
determine how you take this

00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:23.027
massive,
national blood feud,

00:08:23.027 --> 00:08:29.170
of unimaginable scale that's
beginning, and then reconcile it

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.320
into a new nation?

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:43.519
The problem,
in part, is that the survivors

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:48.051
on both sides in this war would
still have to inhabit the same

00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:52.116
land and the same country.
It wasn't as though an actual

00:08:52.116 --> 00:08:55.220
foreign country had been
conquered and defeated.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.146
It was part of North America,
it was part of the U.S.--or

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:04.850
soon to be New U.S.
of some kind.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.950
And the side that lost is going
to have to in time inhabit the

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.100
same government.
How?

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.929
Where do you go in precedent?
Where do you in history?

00:09:15.929 --> 00:09:17.789
Where do you go in the
Constitution?

00:09:17.789 --> 00:09:21.112
Where do you look this up,
to put Humpty Dumpty back

00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:22.220
together again?

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:33.649
Put another way,
the task was how to make the

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:38.934
eventual logic of sectional
reconciliation--knitting North

00:09:38.934 --> 00:09:44.218
and South back together--how to
make the eventual logic of

00:09:44.218 --> 00:09:49.781
sectional reconciliation somehow
compatible with the logic of

00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:55.066
that revolution that was put in
place in 1863--or in other

00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:58.340
words,
Emancipation?

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.357
And by logic,
I mean you have to put North

00:10:01.357 --> 00:10:05.259
and South back together,
but you also now have to deal

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:09.970
with the fact the slaves have
been freed to some new status.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:11.440
Got to do both.

00:10:15.629 --> 00:10:19.520
Put another way,
how do you square black freedom

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.488
and all the stirrings of--the
possibility at least--of racial

00:10:24.488 --> 00:10:28.761
equality now with that cause,
in the South,

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:33.977
that had lost
everything--except its faith in

00:10:33.977 --> 00:10:38.970
white supremacy?
How do you fold black freedom

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.706
into white supremacy?
How do you fold white supremacy

00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:47.621
into black freedom?
Can they ever be--could those

00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:52.970
ever be reconciled?
And what if they can't?

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:57.416
Lincoln spoke of a testing in
the Gettysburg Address--if you

00:10:57.416 --> 00:11:00.959
remember the famous
speech--testing whether that

00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:05.179
nation or any nation so
conceived could long endure.

00:11:05.179 --> 00:11:10.018
The testing of the war in some
ways would become easier than

00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:15.019
the testing the country would
now face with Reconstruction.

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:19.518
Or finally put yet another
way--and I wrote about this at

00:11:19.518 --> 00:11:24.339
too much length in a book called
Race and Reunion--the

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:29.842
challenge of Reconstruction,
and it's the challenge we've

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:34.451
had ever since,
is how do you do two profound

00:11:34.451 --> 00:11:41.181
things at the same time?
One was healing and the other

00:11:41.181 --> 00:11:45.480
was justice.
How do you have them both?

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.985
What truly constitutes healing
of a people, of a nation,

00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:54.408
that's suffered this scale of
violence and destruction,

00:11:54.408 --> 00:11:57.960
and how do you have justice?
And justice for whom?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:06.238
Here's what Lincoln said,
next-to-the-last day of his

00:12:06.238 --> 00:12:10.328
life;
no, three days before he was

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:12.594
shot.
It was his last public

00:12:12.594 --> 00:12:15.720
utterance, from a balcony at the
White House.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.169
He was discussing
Reconstruction.

00:12:19.169 --> 00:12:22.679
His audience that day wanted to
just hear about the glories of

00:12:22.679 --> 00:12:25.502
the ending of the war,
and he gave them a little mini

00:12:25.502 --> 00:12:28.148
lecture on Reconstruction
because it's precisely what he

00:12:28.148 --> 00:12:30.346
was dealing with.
He said this:

00:12:30.346 --> 00:12:36.244
"Reconstruction is pressed much
more closely upon our attention

00:12:36.244 --> 00:12:38.516
now.
It is fraught with great

00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:41.090
difficulty.
Unlike the case of a war

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.220
between independent nations,
there is no authorized organ

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.165
for us to treat with.
No one man has authority to

00:12:49.165 --> 00:12:52.470
give up the rebellion for any
other man.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.344
We simply must begin with,
and mold from,

00:12:56.344 --> 00:13:01.090
disorganized and discordant
elements, with all.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:07.580
So new and unprecedented is the
whole case that no exclusive and

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:13.350
inflexible plan can safely be
prescribed as to detail,

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:18.400
but important principles must
be inflexible."

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:23.300
That's classic Lincoln.
"No one plan must we

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.567
necessarily commit to,
but we must stick to some

00:13:26.567 --> 00:13:30.346
principles."
It's Lincoln the pragmatist

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:33.370
trying to figure it out.
And then he's dead.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.919
But back to wartime,
at least for a few minutes.

00:13:41.919 --> 00:13:45.502
The debate over Reconstruction,
as it will play out through the

00:13:45.502 --> 00:13:49.013
next three years,
four years, really five years,

00:13:49.013 --> 00:13:52.152
up to 1870/71,
is the debate that ensued

00:13:52.152 --> 00:13:56.980
between Lincoln and his own
party leadership in Congress,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:14:01.503
as early as late 1863.
Here's Lincoln's plan again,

00:14:01.503 --> 00:14:04.345
and you can read all of this in
Foner's Short

00:14:04.345 --> 00:14:06.450
History of
Reconstruction,

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.759
but let me give it to you at
least in brief terms.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:15.705
You'll remember I said the
other day that Lincoln wanted

00:14:15.705 --> 00:14:19.273
Reconstruction to be
presidential,

00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:23.621
lenient, and quick.
He was openly friendly to

00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:27.940
Southerners his whole life,
as I suppose everybody knows.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.902
His four brother-in-laws had
fought for the Confederacy,

00:14:31.902 --> 00:14:35.850
et cetera, et cetera.
He was born in Kentucky.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.852
He did not really have any kind
of personal vindictiveness

00:14:39.852 --> 00:14:44.206
towards Southerners the way many
others in the Republican Party

00:14:44.206 --> 00:14:48.216
will have;
and they'll have reasons to

00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:50.762
have that.
Some have argued,

00:14:50.762 --> 00:14:54.929
as Kenneth Stampp once did,
that Lincoln actually had a

00:14:54.929 --> 00:14:58.480
deep personal need for personal
absolution;

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.112
that he carried this horrifying
burden of all that death,

00:15:02.112 --> 00:15:05.549
and that he took it as his
personal responsibility,

00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:09.019
and that this charity for all
and malice toward none,

00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:13.022
and the leniency in Lincoln's
Reconstruction ideas is somehow

00:15:13.022 --> 00:15:16.892
rooted in that sense of personal
responsibility for all the

00:15:16.892 --> 00:15:19.050
suffering.
There may be something to that.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.566
But his Reconstruction policy,
such as he put it in place,

00:15:26.566 --> 00:15:29.219
at least for awhile,
was rooted in his

00:15:29.219 --> 00:15:33.004
Constitutional philosophy.
Lincoln, number one,

00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:37.582
believed secession had never
happened, that secession was

00:15:37.582 --> 00:15:41.833
essentially impossible,
a state could not secede from

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:45.147
the Union.
He chose language carefully,

00:15:45.147 --> 00:15:47.722
as a good lawyer.
He said as states,

00:15:47.722 --> 00:15:50.666
the Southern states,
the Confederate states,

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.130
were still in the Union,
technically,

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:56.301
during the war.
Even though they seceded,

00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:58.679
they were simply,
in his language,

00:15:58.679 --> 00:16:02.210
out of their normal
relationship to the Union;

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.139
whatever the hell that's
supposed to mean.

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:09.352
And they fought this total war
against the United States but

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:11.529
they were not really out of the
Union.

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:17.009
Now that's a legal position,
rest assured.

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:19.980
He made a distinction between
states and governments.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:24.606
He said that governments may
have failed and committed--he

00:16:24.606 --> 00:16:28.664
never used the word
treason--made rebellion against

00:16:28.664 --> 00:16:31.712
the United States,
but as states,

00:16:31.712 --> 00:16:34.780
an Alabama never ceased to
exist.

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.589
Okay.
He's famous for saying things

00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:42.549
like "physically we cannot
separate."

00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:49.113
His idea was to squash the
rebellion, let a number of loyal

00:16:49.113 --> 00:16:53.980
citizens, in one of those
seceded states,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:58.079
create a new loyal government,
restore that state to the Union

00:16:58.079 --> 00:17:01.838
as quickly as possible,
even before the war ends,

00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:06.660
by presidential authority,
under presidential war powers,

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.888
and begin a process before
you'd ever have a surrender of

00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:14.060
what he was already calling
restoration,

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.600
or reunification.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.319
He wanted it done by executive
authority.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:26.264
That wasn't necessarily a
personal power grab by any means

00:17:26.264 --> 00:17:30.069
but he wanted to do it under
presidential war powers,

00:17:30.069 --> 00:17:33.129
because he did understand,
to the extent anybody could

00:17:33.129 --> 00:17:35.900
predict the future,
that once the war did end,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.140
Congress's powers would rise.
A president is never so

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.930
powerful as in time of war.

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:53.804
Now, pause with me for a moment.
What they're all thinking about

00:17:53.804 --> 00:17:56.137
now--Lincoln,
the Republican leadership of

00:17:56.137 --> 00:17:58.028
Congress,
anybody thinking about

00:17:58.028 --> 00:18:00.445
Reconstruction,
during the war or even in the

00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:03.356
immediate aftermath--is really
thinking about a set of

00:18:03.356 --> 00:18:05.639
questions,
somewhat like those big

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:08.750
questions I started with,
but more specifically.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.839
This is what they have to think
about now.

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:14.283
And if you think American
statesmen have been challenged

00:18:14.283 --> 00:18:18.103
at other times in our history,
how would you like to have this

00:18:18.103 --> 00:18:20.299
challenge?
Three main questions.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:30.600
(1) Who would rule in the
South, who?

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.849
Who gets to vote?
Who gets to hold office;

00:18:33.849 --> 00:18:36.502
ex-Confederates,
black people,

00:18:36.502 --> 00:18:42.190
whites who'd been loyal?
How do you determine this?

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:46.138
(2) Who will rule in the
federal government,

00:18:46.138 --> 00:18:51.006
Congress or the President,
in this unprecedented blank

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:54.904
slate set of issues?
The country had never faced

00:18:54.904 --> 00:18:57.130
this before.
How do you reconstruct a Union?

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.779
How do you re-admit states into
the Union?

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:03.670
There's no blueprint in the
Constitution.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.268
There are hints,
depending on how you interpret

00:19:07.268 --> 00:19:11.055
it.
And (3) what will the

00:19:11.055 --> 00:19:20.756
dimensions of black freedom be,
in law and in practice and in

00:19:20.756 --> 00:19:27.869
social life, on the ground,
in the South?

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:33.876
All the while remembering this
all must occur now in these

00:19:33.876 --> 00:19:38.720
desperate conditions of poverty,
destruction,

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:44.390
starvation and tremendous
untold, as yet not even fully

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:50.079
fathomed,
bitterness and hatred.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:54.750
Or let me give you one last
little question.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.871
I love asking questions I don't
have to stand up right now and

00:19:58.871 --> 00:20:02.292
answer.
Would Reconstruction be a

00:20:02.292 --> 00:20:08.817
preservation of something old,
or the creation of something

00:20:08.817 --> 00:20:12.467
truly new?
And if it's going to be new,

00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:13.170
how new?

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:24.156
Back to the war years.
Lincoln issued,

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:27.580
on December 8,1863,
his State of the Union or

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.014
annual message--part of his
annual message--what he called

00:20:32.014 --> 00:20:36.060
the Proclamation of Amnesty and
Reconstruction.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.421
It was issued December '63.
Remember the dates here,

00:20:39.421 --> 00:20:43.599
because this first major debate
on Reconstruction is going to

00:20:43.599 --> 00:20:47.500
occur in some of the most
terrible months of the war,

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:52.380
and yet in Washington they're
also having this debate.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.970
There were several parts to
this, but three main ones.

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.851
It's Lincoln's classic lenient,
rapid, moderate and

00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:04.732
presidential Reconstruction.
It's called the Ten-Percent

00:21:04.732 --> 00:21:06.673
Plan.
He, number one,

00:21:06.673 --> 00:21:09.602
would pardon all
ex-Confederates,

00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.990
with a certain list of
exceptions.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.952
High-ranking Confederate
officials--although he didn't

00:21:16.952 --> 00:21:20.691
entirely clarify how high
ranking--they wouldn't be

00:21:20.691 --> 00:21:24.883
pardoned, at least yet.
He would not pardon those who

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:29.081
had resigned commissions in the
judiciary or in Congress,

00:21:29.081 --> 00:21:31.330
to support the Confederacy.

00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:39.513
And he put in a clause that
said he would not pardon those

00:21:39.513 --> 00:21:43.839
who could be convicted of
mistreating black soldiers,

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:46.607
of which there'd been a great
deal of, and he was under some

00:21:46.607 --> 00:21:48.390
pressure to do something about
that,

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:54.193
by late '63.
And then he said when ten

00:21:54.193 --> 00:21:59.161
percent of the voting population
of a given Southern state--and

00:21:59.161 --> 00:22:03.808
that voting population was
determined by how many voters in

00:22:03.808 --> 00:22:08.616
1860--when ten percent of the
male voting population--because

00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:13.664
that's the only people who could
vote--would take an oath to the

00:22:13.664 --> 00:22:17.349
Union and establish a new
government,

00:22:17.349 --> 00:22:21.586
then he as president,
under presidential war powers,

00:22:21.586 --> 00:22:25.990
would recognize them and
readmit them to the Union,

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:31.678
just like that.
Blacks were excluded from the

00:22:31.678 --> 00:22:35.144
entire process.
There was no mention,

00:22:35.144 --> 00:22:38.970
at that point,
of any black suffrage.

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:44.160
He wants ten percent.
Now, right away members of his

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.992
own party and Congress are
saying, "Wait a second Mr.

00:22:47.992 --> 00:22:51.750
President, what about the other
ninety percent?"

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:57.372
Well Lincoln's idea was if you
can establish a pocket of people

00:22:57.372 --> 00:23:00.910
in lower Louisiana or upland
Alabama,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.509
or part of Virginia that the
Union troops occupy,

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:07.585
and you get,
if you can get ten percent of

00:23:07.585 --> 00:23:11.710
that state to take a loyalty
oath and elect some kind of

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:15.759
little rump legislature that can
meet somewhere,

00:23:15.759 --> 00:23:17.810
like Wheeling,
West Virginia,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.691
where they did for awhile,
then he would call that the

00:23:21.691 --> 00:23:24.741
real Virginia,
or the real Louisiana,

00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:27.339
and they'd be back in the
Union.

00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:32.006
And his idea was that you would
begin then a political process

00:23:32.006 --> 00:23:35.591
of reunification.
A political process would

00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:39.342
already be in place,
as messy as it might be,

00:23:39.342 --> 00:23:44.542
as seemingly undemocratic as it
might be, before the war would

00:23:44.542 --> 00:23:47.980
end.
This actually happened.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.133
Well he didn't--they didn't get
admitted to the Union,

00:23:51.133 --> 00:23:54.228
but so-called Lincoln
governments were established in

00:23:54.228 --> 00:23:57.080
three states,
again where Union armies had

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.089
significant occupation of the
soil of that state--Louisiana,

00:24:01.089 --> 00:24:05.868
Tennessee and Arkansas--and
so-called Lincoln governments

00:24:05.868 --> 00:24:12.380
were created there,
in 1864 and early 1865.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.039
They were pitifully weak
governments.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:18.903
They would've collapsed
entirely without federal troops

00:24:18.903 --> 00:24:22.052
to protect them,
and Lincoln did this utterly

00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:24.700
without consulting with
Congress.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:27.461
And we like to make a great
deal of Abraham Lincoln as the

00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:29.060
greatest president,
and he was;

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:33.307
a political genius, and he was;
magical with the music of

00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:36.430
words, and he was;
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:40.953
And I was just out at the
Lincoln Library where you can be

00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:44.781
sure Lincoln is God.
But not consulting with

00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:50.029
Congress on this one wasn't the
wisest thing he ever did.

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:53.965
Congress began to react with
great hostility,

00:24:53.965 --> 00:24:56.500
in 1864.
Some Radical Republicans

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.670
sincerely believed that these
new Lincoln governments were not

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:04.448
only wrong and undemocratic,
but dangerous,

00:25:04.448 --> 00:25:10.489
and they wanted much,
much more to even consider the

00:25:10.489 --> 00:25:14.990
reconstruction of a Southern
state,

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:21.227
on any basis.
They were led--they being the

00:25:21.227 --> 00:25:29.192
Republicans in Congress--by the
two men on your right,

00:25:29.192 --> 00:25:38.809
Thaddeus Stevens on the top and
Charles Sumner on the bottom.

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:43.384
Stevens, a Congressman from
Pennsylvania who grew up and

00:25:43.384 --> 00:25:47.231
lived near Gettysburg;
fascinating,

00:25:47.231 --> 00:25:52.013
interesting,
driven, passionate,

00:25:52.013 --> 00:25:56.950
complicated,
club-footed man;

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:59.901
a brilliant lawyer,
and a radical,

00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:03.837
and an old abolitionist,
although he had some

00:26:03.837 --> 00:26:08.750
complications along the way.
Stevens and Sumner.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:13.474
Sumner the great Senator from
Massachusetts--the Sumner who

00:26:13.474 --> 00:26:18.606
had had the brains nearly beaten
out of him by Preston Brooks in

00:26:18.606 --> 00:26:22.048
the Senate in 1856,
who left the Senate for nearly

00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:25.185
three and a half years and went
all over the world to spas to

00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:27.119
try to put his head back
together,

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:31.458
including spending most of a
year in Switzerland--was very,

00:26:31.458 --> 00:26:34.750
very much back in the game
during the war;

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:39.123
and he rose in power,
of course, as the emancipation

00:26:39.123 --> 00:26:42.640
issue rose to the fore,
as did Stevens.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.871
And the two of them led the
response to Lincoln's ideas on

00:26:49.871 --> 00:26:53.900
Reconstruction from the two
different houses of Congress.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.797
They had different names for
their proposals,

00:26:56.797 --> 00:26:59.759
but they essentially argued the
same thing;

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:01.372
although Sumner's,
you could argue,

00:27:01.372 --> 00:27:04.680
was even more radical.
Stevens called his approach,

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.789
or his constitutional approach,
conquered provinces.

00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:14.349
He said not only did the
Southern states secede from the

00:27:14.349 --> 00:27:20.212
Union, they should be reverted
to the status of unorganized

00:27:20.212 --> 00:27:24.197
territories;
or, even further he went,

00:27:24.197 --> 00:27:29.596
he said now they're not only
going to have to be put under

00:27:29.596 --> 00:27:33.493
territorial status,
but they should be treated like

00:27:33.493 --> 00:27:36.710
a foreign nation that the United
States has conquered,

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:40.539
a conquered province of a
foreign land.

00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:44.877
They had been reduced by force
of arms, they had made war upon

00:27:44.877 --> 00:27:48.471
the United States,
and under international law,

00:27:48.471 --> 00:27:51.651
Stevens argued,
they should be treated as,

00:27:51.651 --> 00:27:54.991
quote,
his words, "conquered foreign

00:27:54.991 --> 00:28:00.638
land," subject to whatever the
United States shall choose to do

00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:03.540
with it.
Sumner, for his part,

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:08.970
called this theory--it was even
more direct--State Suicide.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:12.546
That was pretty clear.
He said not only had the

00:28:12.546 --> 00:28:15.793
Southern states seceded from the
Union, they committed political

00:28:15.793 --> 00:28:18.440
suicide.
They do not exist.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.456
They experienced what he
called, in his words,

00:28:22.456 --> 00:28:26.829
"instant forfeiture of their
status as states."

00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:31.211
They therefore must be reverted
to what he called "the status of

00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:35.925
unorganized territories,"
as though Alabama was back in

00:28:35.925 --> 00:28:41.108
1820, Virginia was back in 1787,
or whatever year they

00:28:41.108 --> 00:28:45.019
officially became a state--I'm
sorry,

00:28:45.019 --> 00:28:48.220
before that even,
during the Revolution.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.426
And therefore,
in both cases,

00:28:50.426 --> 00:28:54.682
Stevens or Sumner's plan,
all authority to re-admit any

00:28:54.682 --> 00:28:58.150
Southern state or determine the
process,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.763
the means by which,
the laws by which a state would

00:29:01.763 --> 00:29:06.821
be re-instituted into the Union,
came under Congressional

00:29:06.821 --> 00:29:13.216
authority because only Congress
has the power to readmit new

00:29:13.216 --> 00:29:15.580
states.
Take that, Abraham Lincoln.

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:25.841
They issued this theory to
Lincoln in what was known as the

00:29:25.841 --> 00:29:32.680
Wade-Davis Bill in July--4^(th)
of July to be exact--1864.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:36.665
Note the date.
This is in the midst of the

00:29:36.665 --> 00:29:41.599
stalemate in Virginia;
it's just after Cold Harbor;

00:29:41.599 --> 00:29:46.819
Grant has just begun to put
Petersburg under siege;

00:29:46.819 --> 00:29:50.245
the terrible bloodletting in
Virginia is coming in and the

00:29:50.245 --> 00:29:53.430
thousands and thousands of names
on casualty lists,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.795
and Congress issues what's
known as the Wade-Davis Bill,

00:29:57.795 --> 00:30:01.130
named for Senator Benjamin Wade
of Ohio,

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:05.411
a strong anti-slavery Radical
Republican, and Henry Winter

00:30:05.411 --> 00:30:08.190
Davis, a Congressman from
Maryland,

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:12.589
also of at least moderate
anti-slavery credentials.

00:30:12.589 --> 00:30:15.955
What you have here is the
blueprint of Radical

00:30:15.955 --> 00:30:18.722
Reconstruction,
at least the beginning

00:30:18.722 --> 00:30:21.507
blueprint.
The Wade-Davis Bill said,

00:30:21.507 --> 00:30:25.329
they took--the first part of
it--was they took Lincoln's

00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:28.860
Ten-Percent idea,
ten percent of the voting

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:34.168
population of a Southern state,
and they required a majority of

00:30:34.168 --> 00:30:38.619
white male citizens of a
Southern state who must,

00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:42.063
secondly, take what the
Radicals called an Ironclad

00:30:42.063 --> 00:30:45.988
Oath, and that oath said that
they had to get up and swear

00:30:45.988 --> 00:30:50.050
they had never participated in
the Confederate war effort or

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:51.910
aided and abetted it.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.150
Now, immediately you're
wondering how in hell are you

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.250
going to find a majority of the
white males of Georgia,

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:06.240
or Alabama, or Mississippi,
or any other Confederate state

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.830
that can get up and take that
oath?

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.306
The answer is you couldn't.
To the congressional leadership

00:31:13.306 --> 00:31:16.864
that was just fine for now.
The Ironclad Oath was a

00:31:16.864 --> 00:31:19.640
political message,
it was a symbolic oath.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.531
They knew you'd never get a
majority of whites who could

00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:25.577
take this.
The third part,

00:31:25.577 --> 00:31:29.647
they said all officers above
the rank of lieutenant,

00:31:29.647 --> 00:31:34.355
and all civil officers of all
kinds in the Confederacy would

00:31:34.355 --> 00:31:38.841
not only be not pardoned,
they would be disfranchised

00:31:38.841 --> 00:31:43.490
forever, declared not--the
actual language in the bill was,

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.900
"not a citizen of the United
States."

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.981
It was almost as though they
were giving every office holder,

00:31:49.981 --> 00:31:52.399
every officer,
lieutenant and above,

00:31:52.399 --> 00:31:55.880
who was still alive in the
South, an invitation to leave

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.047
the country,
because if they stayed in

00:31:59.047 --> 00:32:03.039
America they would be men
without a country.

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:07.768
They did not set up,
in spite of the lore that's set

00:32:07.768 --> 00:32:11.013
in over the years,
a plan of arrest,

00:32:11.013 --> 00:32:13.980
indictments,
and executions.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.207
They didn't do that at all.
But they did decide they were

00:32:19.207 --> 00:32:25.609
going to treat the Southern
states as conquered enemies.

00:32:25.609 --> 00:32:30.279
They sent the bill to Lincoln,
and Lincoln did what many

00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:34.440
presidents have done,
he gave it a pocket veto.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.765
You know what that is.
He simply let the bill die

00:32:38.765 --> 00:32:42.251
without either signing it,
or vetoing it,

00:32:42.251 --> 00:32:45.650
or to some extent even
answering it;

00:32:45.650 --> 00:32:48.730
although he did finally answer
it.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:52.062
He answered it actually four
days after the bill was

00:32:52.062 --> 00:32:54.610
delivered to him,
in what he titled "The

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.289
Proclamation on the Wade-Davis
Bill."

00:32:57.289 --> 00:33:02.000
And this was a classic
Lincolnesque statement as well.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.756
It was conciliatory.
He thanked them profusely for

00:33:05.756 --> 00:33:09.186
their work on this sensitive and
terrible issue,

00:33:09.186 --> 00:33:11.960
and he didn't completely reject
it.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.956
He refused, he said,
to be, quote,

00:33:14.956 --> 00:33:18.680
"inflexibly committed to any
one plan."

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:24.759
"Okay Abe, but what are you
committed to?"

00:33:24.759 --> 00:33:28.450
is what congressmen began to
say.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:33.971
He was verbally willing to
listen, but he really did not

00:33:33.971 --> 00:33:38.142
placate the Radicals.
They had an impasse here,

00:33:38.142 --> 00:33:41.257
a big impasse.
And note how deep the impasse

00:33:41.257 --> 00:33:44.224
is, it's constitutional.
Who's going to run

00:33:44.224 --> 00:33:47.000
Reconstruction?
Me, the president,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.746
or you the Congress?
Well, the congressional

00:33:50.746 --> 00:33:55.043
leadership followed Lincoln's
little Proclamation on the

00:33:55.043 --> 00:34:00.200
Wade-Davis Bill with what they
called The Wade-Davis Manifesto,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.670
and they published it in
national newspapers.

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.630
It was published on August
5,1864.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.005
It was an unprecedented,
vehement attack on a sitting

00:34:11.005 --> 00:34:15.970
president by the leadership in
Congress of his own party.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:22.502
They lambasted Lincoln.
They attacked him on two

00:34:22.502 --> 00:34:25.010
grounds.
They said his approach to

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.281
Reconstruction was simply way
too lenient--and they're arguing

00:34:28.281 --> 00:34:31.619
this now in August of 1864,
with these thousands upon

00:34:31.619 --> 00:34:34.110
thousands of casualties flowing
in.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:37.640
This is the very time Lincoln
comes to believe he's not likely

00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:40.179
to be re-elected.
And there were some members in

00:34:40.179 --> 00:34:43.201
particularly the Radical wing of
the Republican Party who'd been

00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:45.840
laboring to dump Lincoln from
the ticket all summer,

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:50.712
and probably could've succeeded
in doing it if there wasn't so

00:34:50.712 --> 00:34:51.990
much at stake.

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.616
And they went a second step.
They actually accused him of

00:34:58.616 --> 00:35:02.730
usurpation of presidential
powers, an impeachable offense

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:06.550
if anyone ever cared to take it
any further step.

00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:14.750
Here's the key,
as the dispute emerged that

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.313
summer.
Lincoln viewed Reconstruction

00:35:18.313 --> 00:35:23.599
as a means to weakening the
Confederacy and winning the war.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:27.228
Think of it as a political
strategy, that ten percent idea,

00:35:27.228 --> 00:35:30.731
trying to get some fledgling
little state legislature and

00:35:30.731 --> 00:35:33.222
government,
somehow get two or three of

00:35:33.222 --> 00:35:36.333
them into the Union.
It was a strategy,

00:35:36.333 --> 00:35:42.890
and not a blueprint written in
stone for the way Reconstruction

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:47.528
would always be.
But to the Radical Republicans,

00:35:47.528 --> 00:35:52.871
they viewed this as a much more
far-reaching transformation in a

00:35:52.871 --> 00:36:01.385
building really of a new nation,
when and if they could win the

00:36:01.385 --> 00:36:04.829
war.
They really were at an impasse.

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:09.790
Now you know from our previous
lectures and your reading that

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.849
the fall of Mobile Bay on August
5,

00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:16.644
the same day as the Wade-Davis
Manifesto, Admiral Farragut took

00:36:16.644 --> 00:36:19.095
Mobile Bay.
That had a tremendous impact on

00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:21.901
public opinion.
Then on September 3 or 4

00:36:21.901 --> 00:36:24.248
Atlanta fell.
It had an even greater impact

00:36:24.248 --> 00:36:26.719
on public opinion.
And of course you've got the

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:30.199
presidential race now happening
in the fall, and Lincoln is

00:36:30.199 --> 00:36:34.660
re-elected.
This impasse on Reconstruction,

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:41.199
though, basically just sat
there until Lincoln's death.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:45.462
In the meantime he cooperated,
and so did they,

00:36:45.462 --> 00:36:50.280
on two tremendous pieces of
legislation, on two great

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.014
enactments.
One is the Thirteenth

00:36:53.014 --> 00:36:55.320
Amendment, which we just
discussed;

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:59.559
and I want to come back to that
in a moment.

00:36:59.559 --> 00:37:05.389
Well actually I'll mention it
now.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:08.969
The fact that it got passed is
fairly remarkable;

00:37:08.969 --> 00:37:11.960
that it got passed at all is
fairly remarkable.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.555
It is, first of all,
an amendment that Lincoln

00:37:16.555 --> 00:37:20.639
himself by late '64 began to
advocate,

00:37:20.639 --> 00:37:23.182
especially after his
re-election, vehemently

00:37:23.182 --> 00:37:26.258
advocate, and it's something
exactly that the Radical

00:37:26.258 --> 00:37:29.304
Republicans want.
They were absolutely on the

00:37:29.304 --> 00:37:32.107
same page on it.
And the reason Lincoln

00:37:32.107 --> 00:37:36.805
was--well he had moral reasons
to believe slavery should now be

00:37:36.805 --> 00:37:40.670
eradicated in the Constitution,
make no mistake.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:45.412
But he also had reason to want
this Constitutional Amendment

00:37:45.412 --> 00:37:48.756
because he feared,
and rightly so,

00:37:48.756 --> 00:37:54.314
that if the war ended,
with only the Emancipation

00:37:54.314 --> 00:38:00.450
Proclamation as the legal
sanction for all those freed

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:04.033
slaves,
that there would be nothing to

00:38:04.033 --> 00:38:08.493
stop Southerners from thousands
upon thousands of law suits in

00:38:08.493 --> 00:38:12.975
federal courts,
suing under Fifth Amendment for

00:38:12.975 --> 00:38:16.697
their property.
And it would've--it did happen,

00:38:16.697 --> 00:38:20.063
to some extent anyway,
but if you can get it in the

00:38:20.063 --> 00:38:23.159
Constitution as a constitutional
amendment,

00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:25.703
then they would have no right
to sue for property that is no

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:26.480
longer property.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:34.100
So a lot was at stake.
They wanted a Thirteenth

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:37.693
Amendment because of the
potential invalidity of the

00:38:37.693 --> 00:38:40.300
Emancipation Proclamation
legally;

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.380
they wanted to remove legal
doubt.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:47.719
And you'll remember that the
Proclamation had only freed

00:38:47.719 --> 00:38:50.559
slaves in the states in
rebellion.

00:38:50.559 --> 00:38:55.630
Technically slaves in Kentucky,
Missouri, Delaware,

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.890
Maryland, were still in a kind
of limbo.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.273
It passed the House of
Representatives on January

00:39:10.273 --> 00:39:14.510
31,1865, but it was not easy.
You might think you live in the

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.582
United States of America and of
course there'd be a Thirteenth

00:39:17.582 --> 00:39:20.453
Amendment--finally,
of course, we would outlaw

00:39:20.453 --> 00:39:25.900
slavery in the Constitution.
The vote was 119 to 56;

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.915
it passed by two votes--it
takes a two-thirds majority for

00:39:29.915 --> 00:39:33.650
a constitutional amendment--it
passed by two votes.

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.677
Lincoln began to twist arms;
he began to have personal

00:39:37.677 --> 00:39:40.809
meetings with a select little
list of Democrats.

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:45.159
They didn't have a two-thirds
majority of Republicans.

00:39:45.159 --> 00:39:48.039
They needed some Democrats to
vote for this.

00:39:48.039 --> 00:39:52.375
And by far the majority of
Democrats wanted nothing to do

00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:55.627
with outlawing slavery in the
Constitution,

00:39:55.627 --> 00:39:58.570
but about eight of them came
over.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:03.341
And on the day that it was
passed there was unprecedented

00:40:03.341 --> 00:40:07.090
rejoicing in the House of
Representatives.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.922
The whole hall was full;
congressmen,

00:40:09.922 --> 00:40:15.665
we're told, started yelling,
crying, hugging each other,

00:40:15.665 --> 00:40:21.199
dancing on the tops of their
desks--God knows why,

00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:24.647
in part because of the
importance, the gravity of the

00:40:24.647 --> 00:40:28.426
issue, and in part perhaps
because they'd lived through so

00:40:28.426 --> 00:40:32.373
much agony in the war,
they truly had something to

00:40:32.373 --> 00:40:35.609
celebrate.
You have to go to individual

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:38.769
diaries and letters to really
see it.

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:43.465
There was a Republican who
recorded in his diary that day,

00:40:43.465 --> 00:40:48.491
quote, "Members joined in the
shouting and kept it up for some

00:40:48.491 --> 00:40:51.170
minutes.
Some embraced one another.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:56.027
Others wept like children.
I have felt ever since the vote

00:40:56.027 --> 00:40:59.590
as though I live in a new
country."

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.292
Frederick Douglass's son,
Lewis, veteran of the 54^(th)

00:41:03.292 --> 00:41:06.133
Massachusetts,
in his uniform was sitting in

00:41:06.133 --> 00:41:09.558
the balcony, on the afternoon
the Thirteenth Amendment was

00:41:09.558 --> 00:41:12.035
passed.
His father was back home in

00:41:12.035 --> 00:41:15.054
Rochester.
He immediately wrote his father

00:41:15.054 --> 00:41:17.844
a note, that I've read.
It said, "Father,

00:41:17.844 --> 00:41:21.790
you should've been here today.
Today was your day."

00:41:25.989 --> 00:41:30.864
And then at the same time that
Congress, with Lincoln's strong

00:41:30.864 --> 00:41:35.739
approval, worked on a bill to
create the Freedmen's Bureau,

00:41:35.739 --> 00:41:39.129
an unprecedented agency in
American history,

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:43.585
certainly to that time.
Formerly called the Bureau of

00:41:43.585 --> 00:41:49.071
Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned
Lands, it passed Congress on the

00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:52.702
3^(rd) of March,
1865, just a day before

00:41:52.702 --> 00:41:58.790
Lincoln's Second Inaugural.
It was social reform by

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.692
military force.
Americans had never done this

00:42:03.692 --> 00:42:07.764
before--a national,
federal, social welfare agency,

00:42:07.764 --> 00:42:11.836
in a land that had lived and
breathed laissez-faire

00:42:11.836 --> 00:42:15.883
government;
in a land that had lived and

00:42:15.883 --> 00:42:21.075
breathed this idea that
governments don't provide food

00:42:21.075 --> 00:42:26.366
for people, people provide food
for people, healthcare,

00:42:26.366 --> 00:42:28.630
schools.
Well the war,

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:32.059
of course, had forced a new
kind of history.

00:42:32.059 --> 00:42:35.475
The basic purposes of the
Freedmen's Bureau,

00:42:35.475 --> 00:42:38.811
when it was set up,
was to aid refugees and

00:42:38.811 --> 00:42:41.750
displaced people,
black or white.

00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:45.384
And the estimate--and I may
have used this before--the

00:42:45.384 --> 00:42:47.989
estimate on the ground in the
South,

00:42:47.989 --> 00:42:51.527
by late winter 1865,
was that there were at least a

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:55.630
quarter million totally
displaced starving white people;

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:02.820
much less the four million soon
to be liberated slaves.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.208
The Freedmen's Bureau was to
provide all kinds of physical

00:43:06.208 --> 00:43:09.360
supplies, medical services,
schools where it could.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.059
Its purpose was also legal,
to supervise contracts between

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:17.769
freedmen and employees--more on
that later.

00:43:17.769 --> 00:43:23.062
And its job--and this was an
impossible task--but its job and

00:43:23.062 --> 00:43:28.090
its title was to manage
confiscated and abandoned land.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:38.710
Yes, property.
But who really owns it now?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.949
If the Union Army took your
plantation, who owns it?

00:43:41.949 --> 00:43:46.587
And there is nothing more
primal, of course,

00:43:46.587 --> 00:43:51.010
especially to Americans,
than property.

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:54.475
Now, more on the Freedmen's
Bureau later,

00:43:54.475 --> 00:43:59.239
but it was a terribly important
piece of legislation.

00:43:59.239 --> 00:44:02.164
It passed with majorities in
both houses, of course,

00:44:02.164 --> 00:44:04.860
because the Republicans had
those majorities,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:08.652
and Lincoln gladly signed it,
and it established,

00:44:08.652 --> 00:44:13.630
at least, an agency to be put
in place once the war was over.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:25.058
Now, let me take the last few
minutes and set up what is now

00:44:25.058 --> 00:44:33.039
to happen between old Andrew
Johnson and this same leadership

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:40.090
of the Radical Republicans once
Lincoln was gone.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.473
This is the classic struggle of
Reconstruction,

00:44:43.473 --> 00:44:46.945
Johnson and the Radicals.
Now first of all,

00:44:46.945 --> 00:44:51.139
how did Andrew Johnson get on
Lincoln's ticket?

00:44:51.139 --> 00:44:55.118
Why did Abraham Lincoln choose
Andrew Johnson as his running

00:44:55.118 --> 00:44:57.355
mate?
I've often put this to major

00:44:57.355 --> 00:45:00.232
Lincoln scholars.
Now look, I confess,

00:45:00.232 --> 00:45:04.590
I'm a great admirer of Lincoln,
like most people.

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:07.889
But he couldn't do everything
perfectly.

00:45:07.889 --> 00:45:12.995
And he gave us Andrew Johnson,
and we've never held him

00:45:12.995 --> 00:45:17.237
responsible for that.
And I'm not willing to give him

00:45:17.237 --> 00:45:20.771
a total pass on that one,
because Andrew Johnson ranks

00:45:20.771 --> 00:45:24.840
down there just about minus two
on the list of presidents,

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.020
I think, of all time.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.230
Well how's that for directness?
Sorry about that.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:38.869
If you're an Andrew Johnson
fan, you're lonely.

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:42.483
[laughter]
He's on the ticket in '64

00:45:42.483 --> 00:45:48.678
because--you know this?--he's
the only senator from a seceded

00:45:48.678 --> 00:45:54.150
Confederate state who didn't
secede with a state.

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:57.010
He stayed in the Union,
from Tennessee.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:03.708
He's a complicated guy.
God, he could've been

00:46:03.708 --> 00:46:07.500
interesting.
He had some big flaws.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:10.605
I'm going to leave you with a
little background on Andrew

00:46:10.605 --> 00:46:12.509
Johnson.
As you can tell from the

00:46:12.509 --> 00:46:15.827
syllabus I've put myself nearly
a full lecture behind in the

00:46:15.827 --> 00:46:18.128
course,
but don't you worry,

00:46:18.128 --> 00:46:22.911
because we're planning for
Reading Week a special review

00:46:22.911 --> 00:46:26.650
session when I can give another
lecture.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:32.738
Aren't you happy?
There's an old saying about

00:46:32.738 --> 00:46:36.774
Andrew Johnson that,
quote, "old Andy never went

00:46:36.774 --> 00:46:40.210
back on his raisin'," his
raising up.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:44.250
He's from East Tennessee.
He was born in North Carolina.

00:46:44.250 --> 00:46:50.128
He grew up illiterate.
He once owned eleven slaves,

00:46:50.128 --> 00:46:53.834
although he did free them.
He moved to East Tennessee with

00:46:53.834 --> 00:46:56.260
his wife, Polly,
who taught him his literacy.

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.660
He grew up a Jacksonian
Democrat.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:08.069
His God was Andrew Jackson.
If lovers of the New Deal

00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:14.615
believe FDR was somehow the son
of God, as my grandparents did,

00:47:14.615 --> 00:47:20.949
Andrew Johnson thought Andrew
Jackson was the son of God.

00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:23.969
In 1861 he was the only
Southern senator who did not

00:47:23.969 --> 00:47:27.465
secede with his state.
In 1862 Lincoln appointed him

00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:31.329
the War Governor of Tennessee,
in the occupied parts of

00:47:31.329 --> 00:47:34.503
Tennessee,
out of which Lincoln eventually

00:47:34.503 --> 00:47:38.340
was going to--he did try to
create a new government.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:43.757
Andrew Johnson was his governor.
It took tremendous courage to

00:47:43.757 --> 00:47:48.130
be a Unionist in Tennessee
during the Civil War.

00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:52.086
There was a lot of Unionism in
East Tennessee,

00:47:52.086 --> 00:47:57.010
and in '64 Lincoln needed a
border state running mate.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.950
After all, who had been his
running mate before?

00:47:58.950 --> 00:48:02.325
Totally forgettable I realize;
no one ever remembers the

00:48:02.325 --> 00:48:05.424
vice-presidents from--anybody
remember vice-presidents from

00:48:05.424 --> 00:48:08.875
the twentieth century?
Only those who get Nobel Prizes

00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:12.802
do we really remember I guess.
But Hannibal Hamlin of New

00:48:12.802 --> 00:48:15.800
Hampshire had been Lincoln's
running mate.

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.933
Now what good is a New
Hampshirite on the ticket in

00:48:18.933 --> 00:48:21.394
'64?
A New Hampshirite was useful in

00:48:21.394 --> 00:48:25.866
'60 but not in '64.
So he dumps Hannibal Hamlin,

00:48:25.866 --> 00:48:32.006
in spite of the alliteration of
his name, and goes for a

00:48:32.006 --> 00:48:35.792
political choice.
What could send a better

00:48:35.792 --> 00:48:39.479
Unionist message to the border
states than Andrew Johnson,

00:48:39.479 --> 00:48:43.490
the only Southern senator who
doesn't secede from his seat?

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:51.649
Well, all was pretty well,
at least until the

00:48:51.649 --> 00:48:54.031
inauguration.
Andrew Johnson,

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:56.443
unfortunately,
was drunk at his inauguration

00:48:56.443 --> 00:48:58.800
as Vice-President of the United
States.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.255
Now his explanation for that is
that he had a terrible tooth

00:49:02.255 --> 00:49:05.769
infection and he'd been sloshing
down whiskey all morning.

00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:09.027
But they literally had to stand
him up, prop him up and point

00:49:09.027 --> 00:49:12.340
him in the right direction,
and practically raise his hand.

00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.434
On the day he was inaugurated,
when Lincoln delivered the

00:49:16.434 --> 00:49:19.871
Second Inaugural,
AJ had to be removed to a back

00:49:19.871 --> 00:49:23.190
room.
Not an auspicious beginning.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:30.389
Last thought.
By far the most important thing

00:49:30.389 --> 00:49:34.018
about Andrew Johnson though,
in spite of his early comments

00:49:34.018 --> 00:49:36.652
when he said,
"Treason must be made odious,"

00:49:36.652 --> 00:49:39.102
and Charles Sumner said,
"Oh, he's speaking my

00:49:39.102 --> 00:49:42.212
language,"
the thing we must know about

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:46.673
Andrew Johnson is number one,
he was a virulent white

00:49:46.673 --> 00:49:50.345
supremacist,
he was an ardent states'

00:49:50.345 --> 00:49:54.465
rightist.
Yes he was a states' rightist

00:49:54.465 --> 00:49:59.352
and a Unionist.
It's entirely possible to be

00:49:59.352 --> 00:50:03.644
that.
He also hated the southern

00:50:03.644 --> 00:50:08.289
planter class.
He was never anti-slavery.

00:50:08.289 --> 00:50:10.512
He was not only not
anti-slavery,

00:50:10.512 --> 00:50:14.341
he was an open racist.
He believed the United States

00:50:14.341 --> 00:50:16.651
should remain,
in his own words,

00:50:16.651 --> 00:50:19.260
"a white man's country
forever."

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:24.554
And he had a disposition that
could best charitably be

00:50:24.554 --> 00:50:28.949
described as hypersensitive and
obstinate.

00:50:28.949 --> 00:50:33.320
He was not a flexible
politician.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.442
Well, I'll leave you with old
Andrew Johnson,

00:50:37.442 --> 00:50:42.782
now into the story and messing
things up, and I'll see you

00:50:42.782 --> 00:50:43.782
Thursday.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Good morning, everybody.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.700
Last week we covered the
cultural politics of the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.500
early 1970s and also the
rise of different types of

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.800
politics in the, in
the, sort of the,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.400
this--think of a word
that actually--in a bowl,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.600
a cauldron of
politics in the early 1970s,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.467
whether it's
grassroots affairs,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:33.167
high politics with the
Congressional Black Caucus,

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:36.000
and running
throughout all of,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.567
all of that, the
complications imposed by,

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:41.167
by a commitment to
formal modes of political

00:00:41.167 --> 00:00:43.400
engagement, while you
have someone like Shirley

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.800
Chisholm coming along.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.300
So you see the way in which
gender is this fault line

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.867
when it comes to race
politics in the nation in

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:53.867
the early 1970s.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:56.000
And it's been a fault
line for the longest time,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.867
of course.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:02.067
What I want to do today is
cover chronologically a lot

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:06.767
of the same time
period, but through,

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:07.767
through a biography.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.767
One person I've not really
mentioned much at all in the

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:14.000
course in the
last few weeks,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.600
but who's becoming
incredibly important as we

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.600
go through the 1970s
and into the 1980s,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.867
is Jesse Jackson.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:25.300
So I want to focus on this
sort of political biography

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.567
of this person as a way
to help us understand,

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:33.000
maybe even summarize really,
the shifting cultural

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
politics of the 1960s, of
the rise of a different

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.567
array of
politics in the 1970s,

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:44.400
and then heading us into
really what is this week is

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.900
mainly about, is high,
high, high politics as far,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.600
in, in, in the--as the way
they are expressed through

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.700
presidential politics.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.400
So basically, at
any given moment,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.900
you could go
through high, low,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.600
medium levels of politics.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.400
This week, we'll be moving
from the grassroots through

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.100
Jesse Jackson, up through
the highest echelons of

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.900
power in the United States.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.167
Now last Monday, I concluded
the lecture playing an

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:21.000
excerpt from Stevie
Wonder--Stevie Wonder's song

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
"Big Brother" from 1972.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.400
One of the lines--I
don't expect you to remember

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.200
it--he's talking
about "My name is Nobody,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.667
 and saying you,
the person listening,

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.100
The Man, "your
name is Big Brother."

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.500
And I mentioned last
Monday how that's actually a

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.200
harkening to Jesse
Jackson's own politics,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.767
and you'll see this coming
out in the middle of today's

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:44.767
lecture.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.967
So this is just to point out
these are overlapping time

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.200
periods.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200
So Jesse Jackson.

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.400
The most basic biography,
starting with him as a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.400
college student.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.600
He graduates from North
Carolina Agricultural and

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.367
Technical
University down in,

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:09.600
in Greensboro,
North Carolina.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.700
Same school where,
before he matriculated,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.667
four young men marched into
Woolworth's and started the

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:19.367
famous bus
boycott--excuse me,

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:22.300
the sit-in movement.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.500
So Jackson, although not
politically engaged when he

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.700
gets to campus, knows that
he's arrived at a place that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.100
is suffused with now a young
but very vibrant history of

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.300
political engagement in the
student politics of the era.

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.667
He goes through
A&amp;T, graduates,

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:44.567
and while he's in college,
finally decides to answer a

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:47.200
call he'd been struggling
with for a long time,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.567
and that's a call to faith.

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.667
So he goes to Chicago
Theological Seminary.

00:03:54.467 --> 00:03:58.300
He's in seminary
when the SNCC marchers,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.100
led by John Lewis, get
attacked by the police and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.500
it turns into Bloody Sunday.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.200
He leaves
Chicago--this is '65,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600
of course--he leaves Chicago
and heads down to Selma.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.300
You know, he is like
thousands of other African

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.100
American, white,
brown, whatever,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.200
individuals who come to
Selma to try to be part of

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.200
the solution.

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.200
He's in Alabama, and he
joins other young civil

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.767
rights workers
on the ground,

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:31.700
you know, a number of whom
have gone on to great fame

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.700
and then also infamy.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.200
People like Marion
Barry, the former mayor of

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.600
Washington,
D.C., for example,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.567
was a fantastically
important activist,

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:44.900
civil--student, civil rights
activist during this era.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.200
Jackson, in the midst of
these other clearly talented

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.767
people, he still stands out.

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:53.867
More than anything else, he
stands out because of his

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:55.500
ability to speak.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.400
He is, you know, whatever
you might think of his

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.500
politics, he is
clearly one of the great,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.167
one of the great
speakers in our,

00:05:03.167 --> 00:05:05.900
in our moment, in our lives.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.600
And essentially,
he talks his way,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.367
though sheer force
of will and charisma,

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:16.967
he talks his way into the
inner-circle of leaders.

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:19.400
He's no longer just a
foot soldier down there,

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.767
trying to complete
this march from Selma to

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.900
Montgomery.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.900
He sees himself really
having an important role to

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.500
play in the inner-circle.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.067
And in short notice,
he's actually now in King's

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:40.200
inner-circle, so he's right
around the leader of this

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200
moment.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.300
Very early on, there begins
to be whispers about Jesse

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.800
Jackson: a little bit
too good to believe;

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.100
an incredible
opportunist; you know,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.100
unbridled ambition.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.067
And these are all, you know,
concerns that have followed

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:01.800
Jackson throughout his
entire political career,

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800
of course, but they're
starting at that very

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.800
moment.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.800
The SCLC--[Student sneezes]
bless you--The SCLC,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.767
sensing that they've got
somebody special in their

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:20.800
midst who can really
make a difference,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.067
is engaged in something,
sends him back to Chicago.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.500
And the
leadership of the SCLC,

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.700
King included--[Student
sneezes] bless you.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.967
Oh I thought I heard
another sneeze coming,

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:39.000
it is allergy season, after
all--they see Jackson as a

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.667
person who can sort of
establish a beachhead for

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.300
SCLC, dealing with
economic issues.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.500
Now remember, S--SCLC
heads to Chicago in '66,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.200
so Jackson is sent there to
sort of pave the ground and

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.467
get things set up.

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:56.567
What he does when he gets
there is sets up a group

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:59.300
called
Operation Breadbasket,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.967
and it is a, a group
underneath SCLC's umbrella.

00:07:03.967 --> 00:07:08.200
Operation Breadbasket is
solely based in Chicago and

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:13.700
with Jackson's great
charisma and power,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.867
he starts having
great success,

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:20.400
and starts developing real,
real powerful leadership

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.400
networks,
kinships in Chicago.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.800
Now what was Operation
Breadbasket all about?

00:07:28.167 --> 00:07:30.700
It was about trying
to diversify business

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:34.367
opportunities and service
in the black community in

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:35.367
Chicago.

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.200
This is a highly
segregated city,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.400
very large and densely
packed neighborhood in the

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.600
South Side of Chicago.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.600
It's much more
than a neighborhood.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:49.700
And Jackson uses
a strategy he's,

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.200
he's maintained for decades,
that's the economic boycott.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.800
So Operation Breadbasket is
organized around the idea,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.000
we will boycott, we'll
gather together black

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.100
consumer purchasing power,
and we will boycott Chicago

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.167
companies that don't conduct
better business practices

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:15.300
in, in--business
practices--practices in

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300
black communities.

00:08:20.467 --> 00:08:23.900
Because Jackson has been so
successful at getting people

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.200
together, I mean, Operation
Breadbasket is doing all the

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.100
classic things that, that
civil rights groups are

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.900
doing, have done, throughout
the breadth of this course.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.200
I mean they're
also, you know,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.067
putting food on
people's tables,

00:08:37.067 --> 00:08:39.967
they're providing job banks,
they're basic--doing basic

00:08:39.967 --> 00:08:41.967
education.

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:46.200
The companies quickly
concede because Operation

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.100
Breadbasket is,
is, it's working,

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.567
and so you see companies
start hiring black managers.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
This is important.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.600
I mean this is different
than the boycotts in the

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.200
past, like A.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.267
Philip Randolph
was threatening,

00:09:01.267 --> 00:09:03.200
where he's trying to get as
many black workers on the

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.400
factory floor, thinking back
to the defense industry jobs

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.800
in World War II.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.767
Jackson is going at
the management level.

00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:13.000
He's goes, "We can hire all
the black factory workers we

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.400
want, but there will
be a glass ceiling.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.900
You won't break
into management.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.300
You won't run the
business or franchise."

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.267
That's what Jackson's
target is--targets.

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:25.367
Companies recognize what's
going on and realize they'd

00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:28.167
better get on board, so they
start hiring black managers.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.100
Jackson then, with
the support of SCLC,

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.500
takes Operation
Breadbasket national.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:44.100
It's going to be part of a
national economic engagement

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.600
with race politics.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.600
Clearly,
Jackson's star is rising.

00:09:49.767 --> 00:09:53.500
It's up in Chicago in
late '65 and by early '68,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.000
Operation Breadbasket, that
he started for the SCLC,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
is going national.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.867
Then Martin Luther
King is assassinated.

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:04.700
The great prince
has been slain.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.967
Now, in the moment
of an assassination,

00:10:10.967 --> 00:10:14.700
people do all kinds of
things that are--you know,

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:21.400
we can overanalyze til we're
blue in the face--they do

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:23.400
things they don't really,
can't really quite explain.

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.967
But Jackson, Jackson
was kind of curious.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:29.500
He's there when
King is assassinated.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.600
I can't imagine
that kind of horror.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.100
And for days afterward,
cameras would be following

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.567
Jackson and other
civil rights leaders,

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:39.400
just trying to, you
know, get a pulse on what's

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.500
happening, not just in
Memphis but around the

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.500
nation as cities burn.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.300
And Jackson's wearing the
same clothes that he was

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.000
wearing when King
was assassinated.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.700
He's dazed;
everybody's dazed,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.500
there's no doubt about that.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.300
But Jackson's clothes were
particularly noteworthy,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.867
because they're
blood-stained.

00:10:56.867 --> 00:11:00.067
They had King's
blood on his chest.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:06.067
Now Jackson was right there,
there's blood going to be

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:09.667
everywhere.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:12.467
Certainly you can excuse him
for not changing clothes for

00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:14.467
a few days.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.900
And then this is where
things get interesting,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.200
is that people
start grousing.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.067
Jackson said he's
going, you know,

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:27.800
he's going down to King's
body to try to stop the

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:28.800
bleeding.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.467
He had blood on
his shirt--hands,

00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:33.300
and just wiped it on his
shirt without thinking about

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.300
it.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.400
It's a natural
kind of reaction.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.567
Others start saying Jackson
deliberately put his hands

00:11:40.567 --> 00:11:43.300
in King's blood and
deliberately wiped it on his

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.100
shirt.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.067
Now I have no
idea what is true,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.600
but the fact is, this is the
level of the conversation

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.000
within sort of closer
circles around King,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.867
trying to understand, what
the heck is Jackson doing?

00:11:59.867 --> 00:12:01.867
So you see Jackson with
the bloody shirt then,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.200
being caught in this
interpretative moment.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.067
Is he a symbol--is his
bloody shirt a symbol of the

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:17.067
nation's guilt, or was the
blood on Jackson's shirt a

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:27.500
symbol of his own anointment
of his leadership status

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.500
within black America?

00:12:33.167 --> 00:12:36.900
Now helping understand some
of that really aggressive

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.600
critique of
Jackson, people thought,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.300
you know, what, you know,
"What's he actually doing

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.300
here?"

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.467
It's important to understand
that when SCLC sent Jackson

00:12:45.467 --> 00:12:47.800
up to be an
economic--set the,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.100
the groundwork in Chicago,
a number of them were just

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.067
trying to get him
out of the South.

00:12:58.067 --> 00:12:59.600
The man
wouldn't stop talking,

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.967
apparently, and King,
some--according to some

00:13:02.967 --> 00:13:04.500
reports, like, "Just
get this kid out of here.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:05.900
Send him to Chicago."

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.500
You know, "Have
him do something."

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.800
No one expected
him to succeed,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800
but he does succeed.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.600
And his success
burnishes his ego,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600
which is
certainly substantial.

00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:20.600
And of--without
great surprise,

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.700
his great success
also causes friction.

00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:28.300
Nothing breeds
contempt like success,

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.200
after all.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.000
So as Operation Breadbasket
continues to grow,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.200
as Jackson seems
to declare himself,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.100
if not the, then one of the
most important leaders in

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.200
black America after
King's assassination.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.600
And there's certainly enough
confusion where that kind of

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.600
claim would make sense.

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:55.600
It becomes clear that SCLC
and Operation Breadbasket

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.600
are not going to succeed;
they're not going to survive

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.600
together.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.567
Too many bulls in
the china shop.

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:10.200
So Jackson takes, or splits,
from SCLC in 1971 and forms

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.700
another
operation, Operation PUSH.

00:14:16.867 --> 00:14:19.000
Now you may
remember, thinking back to,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.700
I don't know, a month and
a half ago in the course,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.367
a month ago in the course,
that after the success of

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:28.100
the Montgomery bus
boycott, King was thinking,

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.100
you know, what, what's the
next thing for him to do,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.000
and Bayard Rustin says,
"You've got to have an

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
organization to
capitalize on this energy,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.067
and Bayard Rustin wanted it
to be called the Southern

00:14:37.067 --> 00:14:39.167
Leadership Conference, and
King changed the name to the

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:41.167
Southern Christian
Leadership Conference.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:48.300
Well Jackson splits and
forms Operation PUSH,

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.100
People United to
Save Humanity.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.567
It's what the
original title is.

00:14:54.567 --> 00:14:56.400
People United to
Save Humanity,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:59.667
and it's a perfect example
of Jackson's sense of

00:14:59.667 --> 00:15:03.100
himself, that he can lead an
organization that will save

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:10.367
humanity, but he
had advisers as well,

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.600
say, you know,
"Jesse, that's a bit,

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.600
that's a bit much.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.600
Heck, you're not even
thirty years old yet."

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.900
So the name of the operation
was changed before it went

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:25.200
public to Operation
PUSH, People United to Serve

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.800
Humanity, much more in the
spirit with the Christian

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.167
ethos that
Jackson stood for.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.300
So Operation PUSH
is Chicago-based.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.300
This is Jackson's bedrock,
his organizing center.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.500
Its goal is very much
like Operation Breadbasket,

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.500
which is black empowerment.

00:15:52.867 --> 00:15:57.367
And through Operation PUSH,
Jackson essentially becomes

00:15:57.367 --> 00:15:59.900
the black ambassador to
white corporate America.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.167
This is going
through the 1970s.

00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:04.400
You know, think
of this moment,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.067
we're, we're past the
Black Political Assembly.

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:10.100
We, you now had the
Congressional Black Caucus

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.100
formed.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.900
You have real power, people
in positions of political

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.900
power in Congress.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.200
You have the
angry activists,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.767
of course, certainly, and
you have Jesse Jackson,

00:16:19.767 --> 00:16:21.700
who's somewhere in between.

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:25.800
He can speak and rally a
black mass like nobody else

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.900
can, truly.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.100
But he also knew
how to massage,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.867
quote, "the system," and
talk to white business

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:41.500
managers and corporations,
first in Chicago and then

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500
ultimately nationally.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.900
He was very successful.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.000
So he goes to huge
corporations now,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.700
Coca-Cola,
Anheuser, excuse me,

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:58.800
Anheuser-Busch,
Kentucky Fried Chicken,

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.200
Burger King.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.200
He's going to
these businesses,

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.167
knowing that there was a
disproportionate amount of

00:17:10.167 --> 00:17:13.000
black purchasing
power related to these

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.400
corporations and
their products.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.100
And he threatens a national
boycott of all of these

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:24.567
brands, unless blacks begin
to give--begin to receive

00:17:24.567 --> 00:17:26.100
leadership roles in
these organizations.

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:32.100
This is now--we're, we've
now traversed the 1970s.

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.900
Now we're in 1981.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.700
Corporations say, you know,
"We know who Jesse Jackson

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.400
is, but please, we are
not worried about this."

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.300
You know, "This is a
little bit embarrassing,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.800
and it's true, we don't have
any blacks in management

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.300
positions in the comp--in
these huge companies,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.400
essentially none, but we're
not going to worry about

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400
it."

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.400
The boycotts are called.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.067
And I remember the
Coca-Cola boycott,

00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:05.200
mainly because I liked
Coca-Cola when I able to get

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.500
it--when I was able to get
it and because--and this is

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.700
actually more to the
point--Coca-Cola owns Minute

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.600
Maid orange juice.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.100
I loved Minute
Maid orange juice,

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.200
and all of a sudden, it
was gone in my house.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.200
Now I did not grow up in a
family of black militants.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.900
I grew up in a family, my,
my father can't stand Jesse

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.767
Jackson, almost personally.

00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:27.100
I really don't
know the, the,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.100
the, the source of the bile,
but he just can't stand him.

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.267
But the boycott made
sense to my parents.

00:18:34.367 --> 00:18:38.300
So replacing my beloved
Minute Maid orange juice was

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.467
this--I think it's still
made--this really bitter,

00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:43.100
nasty Donald
Duck orange juice.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.367
It was just horrible.

00:18:45.367 --> 00:18:50.800
So I felt rather aggrieved
by the boycott myself.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.400
But the boycott was
incredibly successful,

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.500
actually, and especially
with Coke and all of its

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.100
products.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.200
Coke starts
losing money rapidly,

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:04.600
and Coke says,
"Well, we've got to,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.767
we've got to fix this," and
they start targeting black

00:19:08.767 --> 00:19:11.300
business leaders in
various communities to start

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.867
buying--allowing
them to buy franchises,

00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:15.900
you know, the local
bottling franchise,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900
for instance.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.467
And then a funny
thing happens.

00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:23.500
Once Coke
changes its agenda,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:30.300
its, its tactic
regarding this boycott,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.300
and starts bringing in black
managers and franchisees,

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.800
they start making
money hand over fist.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.900
They're embraced by the
black community even more so

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:44.900
than before, and
they start realizing,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.267
"Hey, you know,
there's something to this."

00:19:48.267 --> 00:19:51.167
And so Coke becomes a
model, to a certain extent,

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:54.000
which is very important,
to a certain extent,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.367
of developing a
black consumer base.

00:19:56.367 --> 00:19:58.767
In fact you have,
during this moment,

00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:01.100
in the wake of
blaxploitation films,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.900
who are realizing, "My god,
there's a lot of money to be

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.900
made in black America."

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:12.500
You have corporations sort
of waking up and realizing,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.500
"There is a huge market we
have not bothered pursuing."

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.867
You know, whether they're
high-minded about civil

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:20.667
rights or
citizenship rights,

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:21.667
it doesn't matter.

00:20:21.667 --> 00:20:23.200
This is about the
almighty dollar,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:27.200
so corporations start
aggressively courting black

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.900
America and if, in
the case of Coca-Cola,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.300
that meant hiring
black managers,

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:32.167
we're going to do it.

00:20:32.167 --> 00:20:36.600
Now, the caveat to all
of this is that the glass

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.067
ceiling still remains there.

00:20:38.067 --> 00:20:39.067
It's just a
little higher up.

00:20:39.067 --> 00:20:45.067
And this would become a
case of great bitterness,

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.400
this phenomenon, as we go
through the 1980s into the

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.967
1990s, as this first
generation of black

00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:55.200
managers, and women
managers as well,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.900
start trying to move
further up in the hierarchy,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.500
and they're stopped.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.567
You actually have lawsuits
following in Coca-Cola.

00:21:02.567 --> 00:21:06.300
Texaco was quite
famous in the,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.400
in the
mid-to-late-1990s as well,

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:13.700
for a very powerful,
powerfully coherent glass

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.700
ceiling.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.000
But in the early eighties,
some things changed,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.700
and Jesse Jackson is the
person who led that change.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:25.000
Now the success of the
boycott with Coca-Cola and

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.100
other corporations inspires
Jackson to do something

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:29.300
more.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.100
He's going to run for
presidential office.

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:38.700
He runs in 1984, and it's
largely a symbolic campaign,

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:44.700
that is practically scuttled
from the start by Jackson's

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.000
loose sort of "politics
makes strange bedfellows"

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.600
affiliation with Louis
Farrakhan from the Nation of

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.800
Islam.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.400
And, also, for an
unfortunate remark that

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.500
Jackson made
himself, referring to,

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.367
sort of one of
these passing comments,

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:05.067
probably made because
he was quite tired.

00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:09.100
He referred to New
York City as "Hymietown."

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:10.700
That would be akin to
calling Washington,

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.400
D.C., "Niggerville"
in people's minds.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.000
The mayor of New
York City, Ed Koch,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.600
is infuriated
by the comment,

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.467
for good reason, no doubt.

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.300
And although Jackson
apologize--apologizes right

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.500
away, the mayor
wouldn't let up.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.167
He just keeps hammering
away: this is who Jackson,

00:22:31.167 --> 00:22:32.700
Jesse Jackson, really is.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.600
Now we really know what's
up with this particular

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.667
individual.

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.300
And to make it worse, he's
associated with Farrakhan,

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.067
sympathetic to
the Palestinians.

00:22:41.067 --> 00:22:43.900
You know, the whole thing's
wrapped up in this one

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.900
moment.

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.767
Again, Jackson apologized
for the remark as quickly as

00:22:49.767 --> 00:22:51.500
he could, and
said, famously,

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.100
"God isn't
finished with me yet.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.767
I'm far from perfect."

00:22:55.767 --> 00:22:57.967
But the slur wiped
out his campaign.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.300
In '88, he
decides to run again.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.100
This time he--it is
not a symbolic campaign,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.800
not by a long shot.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.400
He's distanced
himself from Farrakhan.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.400
He's much more politically
polished as far as,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.767
sort of, national
presidential politics are

00:23:17.767 --> 00:23:18.767
concerned.

00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:24.767
And in fact, in '88, he
terrifies the Democratic

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:35.167
leadership when he
starts beating their people,

00:23:35.167 --> 00:23:37.767
their likely candidates.

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:40.300
Now I know it sounds like
no big deal in the age of

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.300
Obama, in his
fantastic run in 2008,

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.800
but we have to
forget that for a moment,

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.800
go back twenty years.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.300
And after Jackson wins
the Michigan primary,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.400
he's actually the
frontrunner of the

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400
Democratic campaign.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.000
It's early on,
but people thought,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.667
"The--Wait,
hold, stop a second!

00:24:00.667 --> 00:24:03.167
I mean, it was cute
when he boycotted Coke,

00:24:03.167 --> 00:24:06.200
you know, and his various
antics over time are,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.200
you know,
inspirational, certainly,

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:11.900
but this is serious now.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.767
He's a Democratic
front--frontrunner for a

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:15.800
series of primaries."

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:21.667
Now what's the change
between '84 and '88?

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.667
The big change is that,
aside from being more

00:24:23.667 --> 00:24:29.500
polished, is that Jackson
really masters something

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.367
that Carl Stokes had done
twenty years earlier in

00:24:32.367 --> 00:24:37.100
Cleveland, and he builds a
coalition that hadn't been

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.500
seen at the presidential
level be--had never been

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.300
seen at the
presidential level before,

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.567
through the
Rainbow Coalition,

00:24:42.567 --> 00:24:44.567
this organization
that he also heads up.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:54.700
He reaches out through the
Rainbow Coalition to people

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.100
of all kinds of
aggrieved backgrounds.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.267
You know, blacks, of
course, are going to be his

00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:05.400
strongest base, people
working in labor unions,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.567
people trying to
organize into labor unions,

00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:15.567
the agricultural workers,
reaching out to women,

00:25:15.567 --> 00:25:18.000
to the poor.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.567
And then during this moment
of great dawning awareness

00:25:21.567 --> 00:25:25.467
of the AIDS crisis,
HIV and AIDS crisis,

00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:29.467
he's reaching out to people
suffering from HIV and

00:25:29.467 --> 00:25:31.367
reaches out to the
homosexual community,

00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:33.300
something that was
quite shocking for Jackson.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.500
He reaches out
to the disabled.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.000
And he pulls them all
together in this great

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
quilt, is the
metaphor he uses a lot,

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.100
and says that he
speaks for everybody.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.067
Now Jackson does not
win the nomination,

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:57.067
Dukakis does.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.400
But Jackson, of
course, earns a spot on the

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:07.267
convention floor, and
his speech--and in,

00:26:07.267 --> 00:26:09.600
in prime time, which is
one of the major things you

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.600
want.

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.100
And his speech on the
convention floor is

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:18.500
considered one of the
classics of the genre.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.367
He reaches out during the
course of his speech to the

00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:22.367
coalition I just
talked to you about.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.700
Talks about this great quilt
to be made of everyone's

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.700
separate patches.

00:26:32.467 --> 00:26:35.600
He criticizes Ronald
Reagan aggressively,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.600
especially
his--or especially his,

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.967
what he refers to
as Reaganomics,

00:26:43.967 --> 00:26:49.600
a system of economic reform
that radically cut taxes to

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.967
the wealthy and the idea
that they would get a lot

00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:54.100
more money and they would
invest more in society,

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.300
and then it
would trickle down,

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:58.700
the investments, to the
middle and working-classes,

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.667
trickledown economics,
something that Jesse Jackson

00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:09.067
thought had ravished,
ravaged the American economy

00:27:09.067 --> 00:27:12.000
and the
working-class in particular.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And he sees Reaganomics
as quite morally bankrupt.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And I want to play for you
a clip from the Dem--the,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.600
the, the nomination
speech--the convention

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.600
speech, excuse me.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.700
And you have the
actual, you know,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.600
a version of
this speech in the,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.967
in the reader, I know, but
it is also important to hear

00:27:43.967 --> 00:27:45.567
people, speakers
like Jesse Jackson,

00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:47.900
for the way in which the
great--they carry on the

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.500
great oral
tradition of, sort of,

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.500
the black minister, the
black vernacular tradition.

00:27:57.067 --> 00:28:01.267
And partly, that great black
vernacular tradition allows

00:28:01.267 --> 00:28:05.500
someone like Jackson to
access the language of

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.200
morality and, in
this case, immorality,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.400
what he sees in the
current state of affairs.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.600
Now you'll see
during--unfortunately,

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:16.300
during a highlight
moment of his speech,

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:19.400
this is on C-SPAN and so
they are obliged to show the

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:23.267
crowd, and they linger for
a very long time over two

00:28:23.267 --> 00:28:29.600
people who were then a lot
more culturally relevant in

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.400
a celebrity sort of
way than they are now,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:33.900
Ally Sheedy and
one of the Baldwin,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.100
one of the other
Baldwin brothers.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.700
Actually don't
remember which one it is.

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.167
But, but, so just, you know,
kind of visually ignore that

00:28:42.167 --> 00:28:46.567
and, and listen to what
Jackson is saying here.

00:28:46.567 --> 00:28:53.800
Rev. Jesse Jackson:
Leadership must meet the

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.967
moral challenge of its day.

00:28:58.967 --> 00:29:06.200
What's the moral
challenge of our day?

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:10.300
We have public
accommodations.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:16.800
We have the right to vote.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.167
We have open housing.

00:29:18.167 --> 00:29:21.900
What's the fundamental
challenge of our day?

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.200
It is to end
economic violence.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.367
Plant closings
without notice,

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:28.400
economic violence.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.300
Even the greedy do not
profit long from greed,

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:34.400
economic violence.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.600
Most poor
people are not lazy.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.800
They are not black.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:41.967
They are not brown.

00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:46.300
They are mostly white
and female and young.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.500
But whether white,
black, or brown,

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:54.900
a hungry baby's belly turned
inside out is the same

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.900
color.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.700
Color it pain;
color it hurt;

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.367
color it agony.

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:04.100
Most poor people
are not on welfare.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:09.500
Some of them are illiterate
and can't read the want-ad

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.500
sections.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:15.500
And when they can, they
can't find a job that

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.100
matches the address.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.800
They work hard every day.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.900
I know.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.067
I live amongst them.

00:30:23.067 --> 00:30:25.200
I'm one of them.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.400
I know they work.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.000
I'm a witness.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.700
They catch the early bus.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.900
They work every day.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.600
They raise other
people's children.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.767
They work every day.

00:30:38.767 --> 00:30:40.900
They clean the streets.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.100
They work every day.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.267
They drive dangerous cabs.

00:30:45.267 --> 00:30:47.400
They work every day.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.200
They change the
beds you slept in,

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.600
in these hotels last
night, and can't get a union

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.600
contract.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.300
They work every day.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.567
No, no, they are not lazy!

00:31:02.567 --> 00:31:06.367
Someone must defend
them because it's right;

00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:09.067
they cannot speak
for themselves.

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:11.200
They work in hospitals.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.400
I know they do.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:18.800
They wipe the bodies of
those who are sick with

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.400
fever and pain.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.600
They empty their bedpans.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.300
They clean out
their commodes.

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:32.600
No job is beneath them,
and yet when they get sick,

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:39.300
they cannot lie in the
bed they made up every day.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.400
America, that is not right.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:49.067
We are a better
nation than that.

00:31:49.067 --> 00:31:54.767
We are a better
nation than that.

00:31:54.767 --> 00:31:59.100
So you'll see in
this, this clip here,

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.100
that Jackson is
talking about,

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:05.100
is engaging the economic
issues of the day and

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.067
linking it to what he sees
as a moral failing of the

00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:12.800
leadership of
the, of the moment.

00:32:16.667 --> 00:32:21.400
Jackson is speaking
against--in addition to,

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.100
I'm sorry, this economic
logic that was a sort of

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.200
reverse Robin Hood, this
trickledown economics,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:30.800
he's also speaking about a
culture of covert racial

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:37.900
politics that has come to
define much of the 1980s.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.200
Now, doing a quick survey,
going backwards now to the

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:49.200
early 1970s, President
Nixon is in office.

00:32:51.367 --> 00:32:55.700
But due to culture of
paranoia that's in the White

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:00.100
House, his whole presidency
goes up in flames in

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.500
Watergate.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.500
Gerald Ford is
brought into office,

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.067
after Nixon's,
former president,

00:33:08.067 --> 00:33:10.067
had to be let go.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.100
Nixon was actually pretty
good on affirmative action

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.567
issues, but used--in terms
of trying to create job

00:33:19.567 --> 00:33:23.400
opportunities for African
Americans--but he used it in

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:25.800
a rather vicious
way, as a wedge issue,

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:29.067
to sort of break apart
blacks and labor unions,

00:33:29.067 --> 00:33:31.800
labor unions being, having a
very troubled relationship

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:35.200
to affirmative action,
because it disrupted the,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.800
the, the
traditions of seniority.

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.900
So Nixon uses affirmative
action as a tactic.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.500
Ford comes in office and
he's better on civil rights,

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:50.067
but overall a lukewarm
presidency on civil rights

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:51.067
issues.

00:33:51.067 --> 00:33:52.100
And he's really, I
mean as it turns out,

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.967
a transitional president.

00:33:54.967 --> 00:33:58.567
And then this
mystery from Plains,

00:33:58.567 --> 00:34:04.300
Georgia, Jimmy Carter,
former governor of Georgia,

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:05.400
sort of comes
out of the blue,

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:09.000
a very moderate
Democrat, who now,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.700
as our politics have gotten
more conservative in this

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.467
country, looks like some
kind of crazy liberal often.

00:34:13.467 --> 00:34:15.467
But he's a very
moderate Democrat.

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.067
And actually, on,
on, on racial issues,

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:26.267
he's actually
pretty progressive,

00:34:26.267 --> 00:34:28.667
speaking of a southern
tradition of governors,

00:34:28.667 --> 00:34:30.500
certainly.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:34.267
Carter is able to
speak to black America,

00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:38.000
unlike previous
Presidents had been able to.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.400
He wins huge black vote,
ninety percent of the black

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:46.867
vote; five point two million
blacks vote for Carter.

00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:50.800
He wins by one point
seven million votes.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.800
Now whenever people talk
about this population,

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.400
that population, got
someone elected into office,

00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:57.900
I mean, you can cut and
slice the statistics any way

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.800
you can, but the belief
was certainly there that the

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.200
black vote delivered
Carter into the White House.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.200
And there was an
expectation of return.

00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:13.400
So while Jesse Jackson's
organizing economic boycotts

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:17.000
and, and developing into
the star that he would

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.800
be--really become, Carter
is wrestling over how to

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:29.000
diversify the executive
branch of the federal

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
government.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.967
He starts making
numerous appointments,

00:35:31.967 --> 00:35:33.900
African Americans.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.567
Fifteen
ambassadors are now black;

00:35:35.567 --> 00:35:39.900
thirty federal judges,
fifty--fifty sub-Cabinet

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.400
officials, a hundred and ten
members of advisory boards,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.500
twenty-five members of
the White House staff.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.500
These are numbers that
no one had seen before.

00:35:52.467 --> 00:35:54.900
And we really are--I mean
there's a statistic that's,

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:57.167
that's worth
keeping in mind.

00:35:57.167 --> 00:35:59.500
We aren't out of the woods
when it comes to thinking

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.167
about numbers and race
in political office,

00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:03.367
by the way.

00:36:03.367 --> 00:36:09.367
In 1972, we have the first
time in seventy years that

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.900
you have a, a black person
elected to Congress from the

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.900
South.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:20.567
So there's no black
representation from the

00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:23.667
South in Congress, from
the turn of the twentieth

00:36:23.667 --> 00:36:27.900
century into 1972, right
before Carter takes office.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.100
It would be
another twenty years,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.967
not until 1992, that North
Carolina and Georgia send a

00:36:33.967 --> 00:36:40.267
black representative, first
time since Reconstruction.

00:36:40.267 --> 00:36:42.500
So when we're talking
about putting White House

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.300
appointees in place, it may
sound kind of trivial today,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.600
but you need to understand
that there has been an

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.967
erasure of black presence
at the federal level,

00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:55.300
especially from
the South--and,

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.500
and Carter
brings up an army of,

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.000
of southern folks
into the White House.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.200
One of the slams against him
is that he didn't understand

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.200
D.C.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.100
In fact, he tried to
play himself against D.C.,

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:07.300
and he brought in all these
southern yokels--this was

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:10.200
the critique--that didn't
understand how to navigate

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.200
D.C., but he brought up
these traditions as well.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.000
A tradition of
black erasure,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.100
but Carter changes that.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.400
He was a real progressive
on that re--in that regard.

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.300
But still there
is controversy.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.167
Andrew Young, former
civil rights activist

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:33.200
extraordinaire, he's a
United Nations ambassador,

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.700
big deal, but meets
with Yasser Arafat without

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:37.700
authorization.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.800
He's forced to resign.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:44.367
There's this always
lingering connection between

00:37:44.367 --> 00:37:46.967
African Americans and the
"Jewish question" in the

00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:48.300
Middle East and Palestine.

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:53.367
But what really does Carter
in is not sort of black

00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:56.600
advisers doing things
with great independence.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:02.200
Basically, it's a largely
ineffective presidency.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:06.867
The economy that had gone
in the tank during the Nixon

00:38:06.867 --> 00:38:10.067
and Ford administration
stays in the tank with

00:38:10.067 --> 00:38:13.000
Carter.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.167
Students in Iran
capture the U.S.

00:38:17.167 --> 00:38:20.567
embassy and start
hostages--keep,

00:38:20.567 --> 00:38:25.400
keep hostages,
keeps them for the,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.667
the remainder of the Carter
presidency--presidency.

00:38:27.667 --> 00:38:31.800
Carter actually tried to
have this incredible raid,

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.100
storm the embassy, and then
it was destroyed by complete

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.100
ineptitude in the deserts,
and Carter was exposed for

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.400
being just ineffective
across the board.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:49.500
Seeing an opportunity, tried
to step in and bring back

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600
America's pride.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:54.900
Oh one thing I
forgot to mention,

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.700
part of the economic
challenges here is

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.300
incredible oil crises.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:04.500
The Middle East is rising
up in a coherent way that

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.700
hadn't been seen before
and is crippling the United

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.900
States over oil.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.600
This is a period of
incredible rationing of oil.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.000
Where, I know in Maryland,
where I was living at the

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.400
time with my parents,
depending on your license

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.100
plate number, you could
get gasoline on Monday,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.600
Wednesday, and
Friday, or Tuesday,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.200
Thursday, and Saturday.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:26.200
That was it.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:31.300
And my parents would go and
get gasoline at the local,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.067
local store, and they'd
be gone for three hours,

00:39:35.067 --> 00:39:36.567
because the line
was miles long,

00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:38.567
just to get gasoline.

00:39:39.667 --> 00:39:41.167
The country was
caught in a vise grip.

00:39:41.167 --> 00:39:43.767
And the former
governor from California,

00:39:43.767 --> 00:39:47.500
Ronald Reagan, sees this
as a great opportunity to

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.500
finally realize his
presidential goals.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.800
He runs on a campaign of
trying to bring pride back

00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:00.767
to the United
States, you know,

00:40:00.767 --> 00:40:05.900
embolden the
American presence overseas.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.700
He has this idea
about an economic,

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.700
a new economic model that
plenty of people are willing

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.700
to try, because
nothing else is working.

00:40:16.167 --> 00:40:20.000
And Reagan, with his
incredible oratorical gifts,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.500
and they're really quite
stunning--only Clinton and

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:26.700
Obama can come close
to Reagan's gifts,

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.900
and they actually modeled
themselves off Reagan's

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:32.200
oratorical styles.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:34.900
Reagan ultimately
wins in a landslide,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.600
wipes out a
sitting pres--president,

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:42.600
and he's given carte blanche
to set a new agenda for the

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:49.500
country, set a new
agenda in Washington,

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.500
D.C.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:56.267
He runs on a
prob--on a, on a platform,

00:40:56.267 --> 00:41:00.100
largely saying that
government is the problem,

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.800
something we've all become
quite familiar hearing from

00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.900
political conservatives,
and now especially the,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:10.600
the fringe Tea Party, the
political fringe in the Tea

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:13.300
Party, that the federal
government is the problem,

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:19.200
and that if we could just
go back to the day when the

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.067
federal government
wasn't so intrusive,

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:24.067
we'd find our way
out of this mess.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:30.700
Reagan articulates this most
famously when he declares

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:33.600
that he's--officially
declares that he's running

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.600
for president.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:37.500
Now he's running
around, you know,

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.567
testing out the talk in
various places quietly in

00:41:40.567 --> 00:41:41.967
the country, but
he makes his public

00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:46.667
declar--declaration for his
candidacy in Mississippi,

00:41:46.667 --> 00:41:48.667
at the state fair.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.100
And he declares at the
state fair in Philadelphia,

00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.100
Mississippi--I hope that
rings a bell--that he's for

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.100
states' rights.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.067
Again, federal
government is the problem;

00:42:04.067 --> 00:42:06.067
states' rights
are the solution.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.800
In
Philadelphia, Mississippi.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.767
Now it's important
to belabor the point,

00:42:12.767 --> 00:42:15.567
just in case, just to
make sure you don't miss it.

00:42:15.567 --> 00:42:21.567
When, when Reagan does this,
it shocks people as much as

00:42:21.567 --> 00:42:22.967
it excites people.

00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.867
Certainly his
political base is thrilled.

00:42:25.867 --> 00:42:29.467
"Finally, someone who's
going to get the federal

00:42:29.467 --> 00:42:31.200
government off
our damn back."

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.100
Civil rights
activists are horrified,

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.700
for reasons I hope are
painfully obvious to you at

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.700
this point.

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:40.300
I've already laid out over
the course of the last few

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:44.000
weeks this, this
battle, no longer simmering,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.600
between the federal
government's ability to

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.900
exert authority versus
the state--individual state

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.600
governments.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.400
So much of the civil rights
agenda of the 1960s was

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.767
about creating federal
oversight into elections,

00:42:56.767 --> 00:43:03.000
for instance, and to access
for public accommodation,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.300
places of public conveyance.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:09.467
The federal government was
seen by African Americans

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:12.767
and other civil
rights activists--quote,

00:43:12.767 --> 00:43:15.267
friends of the movement--the
federal government is seen

00:43:15.267 --> 00:43:18.400
to be the most responsible
entity to preserve

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:22.800
citizenship
rights, and Reagan says,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:27.400
"No, that--the government
is actually the problem.

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:28.900
Let's give power
back to the states."

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.400
Now when you are
going to Mississippi,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.367
or any southeastern
state at that time,

00:43:34.367 --> 00:43:36.500
the civil rights--the
heights of the civil rights

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:42.000
movement are just
a decade previous.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
When you go to these places
and declare you're for

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.600
states' rights,
everybody knows,

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.500
black as well as white,
what you're talking about.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:52.267
You're talking about a
return of the organizing,

00:43:52.267 --> 00:43:56.000
or the, the centralizing
power of people like Bull

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.500
Connor, people
like Orval Faubus.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:07.067
You're talking about
authorizing the economic

00:44:07.067 --> 00:44:08.567
power of Citizens' Councils.

00:44:08.567 --> 00:44:12.867
You're talking about
supporting in covert ways

00:44:12.867 --> 00:44:16.300
the Ku Klux Klan in the
worst of the situations.

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:21.167
Now I mentioned a few
moments ago that Jesse

00:44:21.167 --> 00:44:23.300
Jackson's fighting
against economic policies.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:24.300
And this is in
his speech in'88,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.067
the economic policies
that Reagan puts into motion

00:44:27.067 --> 00:44:30.900
after he wins
the presidency.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:32.800
And he's also
fighting against an aura,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.800
or an era I should say,
of covert racial politics.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.000
And this is where
Reagan's announcement is so

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.900
particularly important.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.667
Reagan never mentions
anything about race when he

00:44:42.667 --> 00:44:44.667
declares for the presidency.

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.400
But when you talk
about states' rights in

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.067
Philadelphia, Mississippi,
the site where Schwerner,

00:44:52.067 --> 00:44:53.700
Goodman, and Chaney
were disappeared,

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.000
people understand what
you're talking about.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.400
And this is what has
happened to the--and we'll

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.867
see, over the course of
the next two lectures,

00:45:02.867 --> 00:45:06.500
this is what has happened to
the conversation about race

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:10.667
in America, in what is
allegedly the post-civil

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:11.967
rights moment.

00:45:11.967 --> 00:45:16.867
The laws are on the books,
the Voting Rights Act--the

00:45:16.867 --> 00:45:18.867
Civil Rights Act,
the Voting Rights Act.

00:45:20.767 --> 00:45:22.767
Affirmative action is there.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:28.000
You have all these
mechanisms in place to

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.700
pre--preserve citizenship
that have been race-based

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.700
because they've
been race-denied.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:40.567
It is certainly not
fashionable any longer,

00:45:40.567 --> 00:45:42.867
unless you're out on
the political fringe,

00:45:42.867 --> 00:45:46.700
to, to race-bait in a way
that you could have before.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.600
You know, Bull
Connor was proven wrong.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.867
You can't be like Bull
Connor and expect to have a

00:45:52.867 --> 00:45:55.400
political future.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.800
It's uncomfortable to talk
about race in a way that

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.500
someone might,
someone might interpret as,

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.500
as negative.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.500
No one wants to be
seen as a po--as,

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.500
as racist, certainly no one
who wants to get elected to

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:08.267
office, because if he starts
being seen as a racist,

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:10.200
well, Jesse Jackson's going
to rally the troops and come

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.300
after you.

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:13.900
And I'm not
really being fanciful;

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:14.900
I'm being literal.

00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:19.800
And so you have a
rise of politicians,

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:21.800
and Reagan is an
absolute expert at it,

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.600
that can talk about race
politics with never talking

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.167
about race.

00:46:29.167 --> 00:46:31.000
And that moment, as you'll
see over--again over the

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.300
next two lectures, has never
left and every politician

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.567
since has mastered
it just as well.

00:46:37.567 --> 00:46:40.100
And we'll pick up on
that on Wednesday.

00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:44.367
Thank you.

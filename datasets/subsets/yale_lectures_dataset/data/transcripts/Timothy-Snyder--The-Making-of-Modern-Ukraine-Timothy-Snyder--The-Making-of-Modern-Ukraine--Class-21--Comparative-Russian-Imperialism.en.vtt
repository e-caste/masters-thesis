00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:03.026
(electronic music)

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.060
- Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.710
Happy Tuesday.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.410
Today's one of those days in
which our biweekly lecture

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.840
is going to be delivered by a guest.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.530
And our guest lecturer
is Professor Arne Westad.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.930
Arne Westad studied history, philosophy,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.410
and modern languages at
the University of Oslo

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.540
before doing a graduate degree in U.S.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.130
and international history

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.430
at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.410
Before joining the faculty at Yale,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.200
where he is the Elihu
Professor of History,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.300
he held positions at the
London School of Economics

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.220
and Harvard University.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.590
Professor Westad has published 16 books,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.050
most of which deal with 20th century

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.000
Asian and global history.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.180
He is one of the world's leading
historians of the Cold War,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.940
which he worked on for a
significant part of his career,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.550
writing important work
about the Soviet Bloc

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.770
and the People's Republic of China.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.270
He now specializes in the histories

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.100
of empire and imperialism,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.803
as well as China's place
in the international order.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.550
Today, in one of our very
last meetings of this course,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.630
he will deliver a lecture

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.880
about comparative Russian imperialism.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.870
Arne, the floor is yours.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.703
- Thank you.

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.228
(students applauding)

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.773
Thank you, Wiktor, for
that generous introduction.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.010
I can see the Russian empire
up here flicking off and on,

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.590
and that's a little bit
like what the Russian Empire

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.530
has been over a long period of time.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.910
So maybe that's illustrative

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.960
of what we are going to talk about today.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.730
So I think the reason why I've
been asked to do this lecture

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.320
is that I teach a class
this semester here at Yale

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.240
on comparative empires and imperialisms.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.050
So where we look at the
transformations of empires

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.110
going back to the mid-19th century

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.963
and all the way up to
the U.S. empire today.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.780
It's an undergraduate seminar,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.630
and I hope the undergraduates enjoy it

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.103
half as much as what I do.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.810
So the purpose of the lecture
is trying to understand better

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.220
how Russian imperialism
versus Ukraine today

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.800
fits into a bigger context.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.210
So both of Russia's own past as an empire,

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.820
but also that of the other empires.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.560
And I think one of the
problems that we've had

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.900
conceptually and interpretatively

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.580
with regard to Russia's
war of aggression this year

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.490
is that it hasn't been understood enough

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.683
in terms of those contexts.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.490
And I hope this class overall
have helped the people

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.230
who are here or those who are watching

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.110
understand that aspect
of the conflict better,

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.060
because it is, to me, crucial,

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.120
not just in terms of
the conduct of the war,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.970
but also how the war is going to end.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.010
Without understanding
that deeper background,

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.880
it's really hard to
get to understand that.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.060
So I'm gonna be looking, as
I said, at Russia's own past,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.300
but also gonna be looking,
although briefly, at China,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.193
at France, at Britain, and to
some extent, to United States,

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.790
which also I think in terms of its past

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.693
certainly best should be
understood as an empire.

00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:34.693
And I'm gonna start with the
drivers of Russian imperialism

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.850
coming out of the 19th century

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.440
that stayed with us for a very long time.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.623
And you will hear
resonances of these today.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.240
I'm going to talk about the competition

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.690
between the Russian Empire
and other empires in Europe

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.920
and outside of Europe.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.750
I'm going to talk in particular

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.673
about the Qing Empire in China,

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.870
the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.720
and Eastern Europe and Britain.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.720
Just to get a sense of how
this element of competition

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.090
came to frame much of the thinking

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.210
both back in the early 20th century,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.693
but also today about
Russia's place in the world.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.420
Then I'm going to do
in the substantial part

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.701
more of a direct comparison between Russia

00:04:28.701 --> 00:04:33.570
and its relationship
to Ukraine and Britain,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.740
really meaning England, in
its relationship to Ireland,

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.010
and France in its relationship to Algeria.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.070
And I picked these up not
because they're identical,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.510
they're not identical,

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.700
but they have a lot in common

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.390
in terms of how long the
involvement has lasted.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.190
But also crucially, to me,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.383
that this is a matter of decolonization.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.620
Even though these areas,

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.400
these countries are close
to the Imperial Centers,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.960
Ireland and Algeria,

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.600
their evolution has been an evolution

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.720
driven in the 20th
century by decolonization.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.520
And what I'm indicating here, of course,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.940
is that the relationship
between Russia and Ukraine

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.790
is in many ways similar in character,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.750
not in every context
of those relationships.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.950
And then I'm gonna finish
before we hopefully have time

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.050
for just a couple of questions

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.610
about talking about what drives
Russian imperialism today,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.580
especially, but not exclusively,
with regard to Ukraine.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.993
So that's the overall
framework for this lecture.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.080
And some of this of course

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.760
you will have touched upon before,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.950
but probably not in the context

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.233
that we're trying to draw up today.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.650
So let me start then

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.220
with the drivers of Russian imperialism.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.320
Is there anyone who can stop that map

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.689
from flicking on and off?

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.410
- [Speaker] Press Escape
button on the keyboard.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.920
No, no, no, keyboard ESC.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.473
- Press the Escape button.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:06.810
- [Speaker] Yeah.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.360
- That seems to be a good idea.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.300
So we're gonna start by thinking

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.310
about the drivers of Russian imperialism,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.163
the way that it came
out of the 19th century.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.980
Some of these drivers, in my view,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.500
as you will hear later on in the lecture,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.983
have stayed relatively intact
and others have changed.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.440
The argument I'm putting forward here

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.130
is not an argument about
absolute continuity.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.320
It is about the need to understand

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.290
the starting point for many
of these forms of thinking.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.870
Without which, I think we
are lost in our attempt

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.861
at understanding what
is the situation today.

00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:44.861
(telephone ringing)

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:50.723
It's this one.

00:06:50.723 --> 00:06:51.659
It's not me.

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:53.512
(students laughing)

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:54.345
(telephone ringing)

00:06:54.345 --> 00:06:57.345
(students laughing)

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.560
Probably.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.510
It should have been a red phone, right?

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:13.820
So the first of these drivers
is also the most complex one.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.310
It's a sense on the Russian side

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.953
within the Russian elite
or elites of uniqueness,

00:07:21.953 --> 00:07:25.800
of exceptionalism, of standing apart

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.990
as an empire from other empires.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.940
Now, Russia, you underline this,

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.650
Russia is not the only empire

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.110
that thinks of itself in that way.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.760
You are sitting here within an empire

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:38.823
that thinks of itself very
much in that way, right?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.630
What is a little bit special with Russia

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.900
is how comprehensively some
of these ideas developed

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.083
from fairly early on about religion,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.323
about authenticity, which is
a term that is often used,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.833
for Russian speakers
here, "samoefikasnost"

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.370
which can be translated
in many different ways,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.370
but self being, very often,
and I think most correctly,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.720
certainly in the context
of the 19th century,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.950
translated as at authenticity,

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:18.993
being close to the people,

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.870
having a certain almost mystical
connection between elites.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.240
Then of course being imperial elites,

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.250
and the vast majority of people

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.230
who were included in the empire,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.600
not just Russians, it should be said,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.600
but everyone that was
included within the empire.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.330
A genuine understanding of people's wishes

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.780
that other empires,
according to these texts,

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.213
did not possess.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.350
A search for a genuine order

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:56.010
that could represent those
wishes of the people.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.530
Of course leading to the idea

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.980
or the ideal of benign authoritarian rule.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.370
And you will hear much
of this being reflected

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.640
in some of the discourses
later on as well.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.930
And speaking of this, by the way,

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.473
I'm reminded of the
great British historian,

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.540
Sir Lewis Namier.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.990
I don't know if Namier's name has come up

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.930
earlier in this series of lectures.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.330
He was one of the people,
though most of his work

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.850
was on British constitutional history,

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.690
who gave voice to this idea
about a particular link

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.753
between Russia, Russian
empire, and authenticity.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.360
So Namier was born in Warsaw
in the late 19th century

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.760
under the name of Bernstein.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.633
He then moved with his family
to Ternopil, where he grew up.

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:48.963
Polefied, is that the word?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:54.420
Polefying his name to Niemirowski,
which then became Namier

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.560
when he came to Britain as a student.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.410
Authenticity was the
term that he often used.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:03.420
He hated the Polish Republic.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.850
He hated Germany even more.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.680
He was ambivalent on Ukraine,

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.980
but he was big on Russia
because it was authentic, right?

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.380
In a way that other empires,
including the British Empire,

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.993
which he served for most
of his life, were not.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.630
So this is the first driver:

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.680
uniqueness, exceptionalism, authenticity.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.200
The second one, it seems to me,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.680
is the emphasis within
the official discourse

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.203
of expansion as being defensive.

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.390
Now, again, other empires do this as well.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:38.790
There is always a border
that needs to be pacified.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.250
We're gonna talk about
the Qing Empire later on,

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:42.660
always a border to be pacified,

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.660
the British Empire stumbled
into its empire, et cetera.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.260
But it's never emphasized
as deeply and for as long,

00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:59.310
in my view, as the expansion
of the Russian Empire.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.590
And much of it was then rubbed off

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.380
in a somewhat different
form to the Soviet Union,

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.640
when that was reconstituted later on

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.640
within what had been the Russian Empire.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.620
Now, some of this is easy to understand,

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.390
the emphasis on defense.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.340
Part of the reason is
that Russia, of course,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.220
confronted empires east and west,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.350
that for most of its existence,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.573
were much stronger than Russia itself.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.910
In Europe, for sure,
but also the Ottomans,

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.080
and certainly the Qing in East Asia,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.060
as the Russian empire
discovered fairly early

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.730
in its expansion East, you
didn't mess with the Qing.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:39.900
That was not a good idea.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.050
It was probably in terms of
sheer military capability

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.560
combined with a ideology of aggression,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.380
the one that you really didn't
want to come up against.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.930
So this idea of expansion
as being defensive

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.320
in order to meet challenges
that other empires are stronger,

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.573
very significant in the 19th century.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:05.403
Then thirdly, expansion as opportunistic.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:08.610
And this is the one
that is most problematic

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.060
in a way to deal with,
because it isn't 100% true.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.960
I mean, it's not arguing
that there weren't plans

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.473
for expansion within the Russian
Empire in the 19th century.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.180
There certainly were such plans,

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:25.470
but in a way, I would argue

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.930
that were much less carried through on

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.840
in the Russian Empire than in
any other empire that I know,

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.570
including the ones that
I mentioned so far.

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.430
Part of the explanation
for that is, of course,

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.703
the relative weakness that
I have already referred to.

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:44.540
But then of course, making use
from the mid-19th century on

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.420
of a unique moment when the Eastern,

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:53.550
and here I would include
Britain, meaning British India,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.270
the eastern empires that Russia
confronted got into trouble,

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.540
all three of them, the Qing,
the British, and the Ottomans,

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.893
roughly at the same time.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.090
The Qing, mainly for domestic
reasons, I would argue,

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:09.120
and then followed by what confrontations

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.070
with Western imperialism,

00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:14.470
the Ottomans because of the
beginning of nationalist

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:17.760
organizations in part
of the Ottoman Empire,

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.190
especially in the European
part, and the British,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.970
because of the rebellion
in India in the 1850s.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.070
So instead of pushing outwards,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.680
these empires start to step aside,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.820
opening up for a remarkable period

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:34.320
of Russian imperial expansion.

00:13:35.207 --> 00:13:36.690
Now, that's opportunistic.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.640
It's opportunistic for a reason.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.437
That reason is the weakness of others.

00:13:40.437 --> 00:13:43.983
But it also tells you something
about the ability to act.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.203
And that is what happened
in the late 19th century.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.993
And the result you see up here,

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.170
in terms of this is the Russian Empire,

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.420
and on 1914 or thereabouts.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.560
If you look at the red line,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.660
which is the one that
we are really broke upon

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.063
massive expansion of territory.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:10.170
Then fourthly, a driver
of Russian imperialism

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.163
coming out of the 19th century
is the emphasis on hierarchy,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.440
bureaucracy incorporation of elites.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.843
Also, meaning, it was non-Russian elites.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.990
So again, these are characteristics

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.360
you would find in any empire,

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:30.600
but particularly, the
emphasis on the incorporation

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.860
is something that the
Russian Empire took very far.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.770
Most of the people, I think
Putin will be profoundly shocked

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:38.603
if he reflects on this,

00:14:38.603 --> 00:14:41.820
but most of the people who constituted

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.830
the expansionist elite

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.023
in the Russian empire were not Russian.

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.549
They came out of other, mainly European,

00:14:49.549 --> 00:14:53.250
not exclusively, peoples that were part

00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:55.590
of the Russian empire in the 19th century.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.330
They staffed and mandated,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.690
and they were the bureaucrats
that came to serve it,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.690
which was part in a way of the promise

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.700
that the empire presented to them

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.700
in terms of how working for
and with the Russian Empire

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.150
could serve a lot of people

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.860
who were not necessarily Russian,

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.710
or perhaps even more crucially,

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.673
had not been born in a
dominion of the Tsar.

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.100
That worked.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.150
And it worked for a very, very long time.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:31.860
It wasn't uncontroversial.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.010
Certainly not in the areas
that had been colonized.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.370
Neither was it uncontroversial
within Russia itself,

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.440
but it was a powerful aspect

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:43.173
of how the Russian empire worked.

00:15:44.249 --> 00:15:49.023
People who were born, grew
up in Ukraine, for instance,

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.010
in many cases, went to
serve the Russian Empire

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:58.010
in far away places, Poles,
Germans, Belarusians,

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.420
you have it.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.220
I won't go through all
the different groups

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.460
that served in these kinds of worlds.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.533
So hierarchy, bureaucracy, incorporation.

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:16.020
Of course, a driver of
Russian expansionism

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.830
was also the exploitation of resources.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:22.477
So for those who were already thinking,

00:16:22.477 --> 00:16:25.260
"Aha, here's Professor Westad arguing

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.220
a completely idealistic understanding

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.570
of Russian imperialism."

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:31.470
Not so.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.290
I mean, there were
motives that were driven

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.200
by the wish for exploitation of resources

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.550
outside what had been the
established borders of the empire.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.140
What is remarkable though

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.900
about the Russian Empire
for a very, very long time

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.840
was that it was relatively ineffective

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.240
in exploiting those resources.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.400
So this was not for a lack of trying,

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.260
but if you look at this map,

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:56.820
and you will have heard this many times,

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.650
I'm sure, in this class,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.750
distance sometimes defeated

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.630
the best purpose of exploitation, right?

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:06.600
You could grab the resources,
as all imperialists do,

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.580
that you want and that you need,

00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:10.710
but could you easily bring them to market,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:12.720
which here would be mainly in the West?

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.780
Did you even necessarily
want to bring them to market

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.880
when you could use them
to strengthen the state

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.873
much more locally?

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:21.960
Those are questions that need to be asked

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.210
about the Russian empire.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.290
So saying that this is
not about the exploitation

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:32.310
of resources as almost
all imperial ventures are,

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:35.130
would be wrong, but it's
also important to remember

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.110
her relatively ineffective,

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:38.740
inefficient for a very long time

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.083
the Russian Empire's exploitation
of these resources were.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.470
And then the final driver
that I'm going to mention,

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:52.653
there are many, but it
has to stop somewhat.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:55.353
It's about settlement.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:59.197
So again, if you look at the map,

00:18:01.023 --> 00:18:02.850
we should have had a map that indicated

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.740
where people from various parts of Russia

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.050
settled during the empire,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:11.610
but especially after
emancipation, from the 1860s,

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.910
you have a massive expansion of settlement

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.940
in various parts of Russia, far
from where people were born.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.943
So not just saying that it
was (indistinct) who settled.

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:24.150
They were fairly large number,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.670
but there were also
other kinds of peoples.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:29.520
The empire, in a way,
opened up for settlement.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.920
For those of you who are here

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.720
primarily because of your
interest in Ukrainian history,

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.700
you should look at where
Ukrainians have ended up

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.370
all over the Russian empire.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.077
Maybe especially look at the far east

00:18:43.077 --> 00:18:45.000
and what is today the Maritime provinces,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.040
which has a very large number

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.283
of people from Ukraine settling.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.223
This is important, because
not all empires settle, right?

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.180
There are some,

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.540
Russia is among them, where settlement,

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.330
trend settlement, whatever
you want to call it,

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.190
is an important part of the drivers.

00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:10.530
We're gonna come back to
this a little bit later on.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:12.420
And there are others that
are too much less of it.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.820
And then of course
there other hybrid ones,

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.820
like the British Empire that
would settle in some areas,

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.883
which is part why fairly large
number of you are here today.

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.310
North America would settle,

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:32.850
Australia would settle parts of Africa,

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.860
and carrying out at least episodic

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:36.873
acts of genocide as they did so.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.620
But then in other parts
of the British Empire,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.840
settlement was not on the agenda.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.390
There was very little
British settlement in India,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.560
for instance.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.450
And we can, if you are interested

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.370
in comparative imperial history,

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.880
we could move further
into why that was so.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.070
I often use the example of Korea.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:20:01.070
So Korea was in some kind of
union in a very broad sense,

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:05.160
being linked to Chinese empires
for a very, very long time.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.780
But there were no Chinese attempts

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.040
at settling Chinese people in
Korea during that time period.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.360
From the early 20th century,

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.450
Korea became gradually a
part of the Japanese empire,

00:20:15.450 --> 00:20:18.690
and the Japanese settled
in very large numbers.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.000
So it's important,
particularly for those of you

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.530
who have an interest in concepts

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:23.880
linked to certain colonialism,

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.880
it's important to understand
what this is really about,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.790
and what the forces are, the drivers of it

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.383
why it consult the way it is.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.530
So these are the drivers
of Russian imperialism

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:37.443
at the higher level the way I see them.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.330
So let's then turn to
the issue of competition

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.370
that I mentioned originally.

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:52.370
And I do think that this is
important in order to understand

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.330
why we ended up with a Russian empire

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:00.510
that control all of
this enormous land mass

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.093
that we are looking at here.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.430
And you will know this, and
I'm not gonna dwell on it,

00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:14.520
Russian expansion towards the
east and towards the south

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.460
and into other parts of
Europe started quite early.

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:20.490
We're talking about the 17th century,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.173
in the early 17th century.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.330
But of course, during that
time period, as I already said,

00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:29.460
the Russian Empire had to be very careful

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.043
not to come up against stronger empires,

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.490
which would basically
whack them if they tried

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.520
to get into the areas that were contested.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.520
So most of that expansion
went northward and eastward

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.240
into areas in which the
anti-imperial resistance

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.560
were much weaker.

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.903
That was the story for
a very, very long time.

00:21:56.220 --> 00:22:01.053
And it's really the 19th
century that changes this.

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.593
As I already indicated,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.640
it's important sometimes to
recognize this in history.

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.860
The Russian Empire, in
many ways, got lucky.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.730
It got lucky with the Qing.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:16.650
It got lucky with the Ottomans.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.050
It got lucky with the
British for no reason

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:22.260
connected to the Russian
Empire itself, right?

00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:27.260
There was the opportunity to
expand into enormous areas,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.880
because of that weakness
of Russia's opponents.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.880
So you see that here along the
borders of the Russian Empire

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:44.940
going into the (indistinct),
going into Central Asia,

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.170
Southern parts of Central Asia,

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:47.550
which had been an absolute no-no,

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.710
because if you went in there,

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.360
you got in trouble with the Qing.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.103
And then of course,
ultimately, in the far east,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.090
what became the Maritime
provinces were taken directly

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.130
from the Qing Empire when the Qing

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.403
got into real trouble in
the late 19th century.

00:23:07.482 --> 00:23:11.820
I think we can learn a lot
about how empires behave

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.180
if we think about them in
terms of competition, right?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.270
Not just each empire for itself,

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.940
which generally has been the approach,

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:24.000
but also how empires
learn from each other,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.403
how they see each other.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.520
My Princeton colleague Jeremy Adelman

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.530
has written really well on this.

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.280
I mean, how empires take
over characteristics,

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.080
take over imperial
technologies from others.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.850
And in many ways, this is what Russia

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.820
then proceeded to do in the 19th century.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:49.820
Of course, not just in the
areas that were taken over,

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.520
but in other parts of the
Russian Empire as well.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:58.520
This sudden explosion in
expansion also gave rise

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.530
to much of this restlessness

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.590
that took place in other parts of Russia,

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:09.150
which even truly would lead
up to the fatal engagement

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:13.200
in the war in 1914, and
then to the collapse

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.720
of the Russian Empire in the revolution.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.210
A collapse that quite a number
of historians will explain,

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.930
at least in part, by overstretch,

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.000
that they were trying
to do too many things

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.310
at the same time and therefore failed.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:28.203
There's a lot to be said for that.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.447
Yale colleague Paul Kennedy's term

00:24:31.447 --> 00:24:36.270
"imperial overstretch" I think
is incredibly well applied

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.793
to Russia in the late 19th century.

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:45.920
So comparison is not just a
issue by issue comparison,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.000
at least to me.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.670
Comparison can also tell us a great deal

00:24:50.670 --> 00:24:53.520
when you think about it
in a broader context,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.070
when you think about it
in a societal context,

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.350
an economic context, and
maybe first and foremost,

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.570
in a state context.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.120
Not just about political systems,

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.330
but about how one create
or tries to create

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:10.050
capable states that respond to these kinds

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:15.050
of imperialist opportunities
as they come out.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.710
Now, I thought at this point,

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.250
that it could be quite
helpful for us to explore

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.490
some of the categories that most of which

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.590
we have already touched upon

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.000
in terms of drawing a
more immediate comparison,

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.263
as I said, to begin with,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.343
between Russia, Britain, and France.

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:41.850
I'm not picking these three
because they are the only three

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.260
that you could possibly compare.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.190
I mentioned the Qing.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:47.043
I mentioned the United States,

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.850
but there is something in particular

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:52.710
about the start of expansion

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:56.580
with these empires,
Russia, Britain, France,

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.290
that I think can be quite illustrative.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.370
And many people now lost decade or so

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.780
who want to work on comparative
empires and imperialisms,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:09.513
have started looking at these factors.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.320
With Ukraine being a
significant part of it

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.350
in terms of its relationship to Russia.

00:26:16.350 --> 00:26:20.130
And the parallels then,
as I said, to begin with,

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:24.870
is the English in Ireland
and the French in Algeria,

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:29.650
both early attempts at colonization

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.763
that lasted for a very long
time and ultimately failed.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.620
They failed because the people
who lived in these regions

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.560
took on identities, accepted identities,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.430
worked through identities
that were not commensurate

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.000
with imperial project
that had been put on them

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.933
from the outside, even
though significant elements,

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.070
think language remained,

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:02.493
or after that imperial period was over.

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.980
Anti-colonial revolutionaries in Algeria

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:09.453
mainly wrote in French.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.723
The activist of the Sinn Féin

00:27:14.723 --> 00:27:16.650
and the Irish Republican Army

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.780
used almost exclusively English.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.273
So there are things that do remain.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:25.650
But let's look at this in terms of

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.253
some more specific comparisons.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.440
One, and here we get to
go back to that term again

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.243
is of course about settlement.

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.720
This is difficult
because settlement happen

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.130
in slightly different forms
in these three countries.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:49.053
So in Algeria, in Ireland, and in Ukraine.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.470
So in Ireland settlement,
English settlement,

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.770
happened more or less
all over the country.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.030
But then increasingly,

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:01.770
and here we see a parallel to Ukraine,

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.280
increasingly, as industrialism
started to take hold

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.140
in the most resource rich,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.060
energy rich parts of the country,

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.563
meaning the north, right?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.410
And the parallel here,
of course, is Donbas

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:17.850
in the eastern parts of
Ukraine in particular.

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.430
There's also a parallel to France

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.430
in Algeria, where it
was the most productive,

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.380
but mainly in agricultural terms,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:32.430
areas along the coast that were colonized

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:35.010
by French-speaking people,

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.080
not necessarily people
who came from France,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.300
but people whose main language was French

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.640
and moved into these areas

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:44.553
under the auspices of the French Empire.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.210
In all three of these countries,

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.183
in terms of settlement activities,

00:28:56.186 --> 00:28:59.253
the native population
were mainly excluded.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:03.390
Not fully excluded, but mainly excluded.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:06.510
The arguments that were being used

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.973
for this were of different kinds.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:14.160
One had to do with education
and skills, which of course,

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:17.400
the empire that was in
control deliberately deprived

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.150
the people they were ruling over of.

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:23.066
If you ever heard of a
self-fulfilling prophecy,

00:29:23.066 --> 00:29:25.740
you can see that that one is there.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.250
But also, of course, loyalty
to the imperial project,

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.240
which was very, very significant

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.420
probably as we already touched upon,

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.103
in all three of these cases,

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:41.250
particularly in the late 19th century,

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:44.400
settlement was a part of expanding

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.140
one's own population overseas.

00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.060
And in these cases, of course,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.550
in areas that were pretty close

00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:53.550
to the imperial model country,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.523
which is important in this context.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.370
But the comparisons here are
not just about settlement.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:04.323
They're also about incorporation.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.240
And this is when things I
think get really interesting.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.240
The idea at the Imperial
Center of these countries,

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.970
which had, for most of the countries,

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:20.700
had a separate existence

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.440
being an integral part
of the imperial homeland,

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.150
not just the imperial state.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:28.953
Imperial states are vast,

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:31.860
over to the peripheries.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.320
And no would, or very few people,

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.700
especially if you're not French,

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.190
would make an argument
that these faraway places

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:42.060
actually are a part of France
or part of whatever, right?

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.550
But if you happen to be next door,

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.793
it is more problematic in many ways.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:53.010
So you get this argument
in the late 19th century,

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:57.243
which has resonated all the way
down to very close to today,

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:02.070
that Ireland really belongs to Britain.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.593
It is part of the British Isles, right?

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.020
It should be incorporated.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.060
More incorporation is what is necessary,

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.070
not less incorporation.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:14.130
Until, of course, the British hit

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.260
at one of the weaker moments in history,

00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.840
an armed rebellion that
they couldn't overcome,

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.260
that established an Irish state.

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:24.240
But in the process of that,

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.643
this is where incorporation
really resonates.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.910
The British kept hold of the north,

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.170
of the northern parts of Ireland,

00:31:31.170 --> 00:31:33.770
which had been the part
that had been mostly settled

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.010
by English people, Scottish people,

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.900
other people from the
empire who had come in

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:43.440
to work at the factories
and work in the areas,

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.213
in the north.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.320
In the Franco-Algerian situation,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.523
things were even worse in
terms of finding a solution,

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:56.430
because as many of you will know,

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:00.390
in the late 1940s and 1950s,

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.970
the position that the French state took

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:06.393
was that Algeria was an
integral part of France.

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:11.850
Even considering any form of autonomy,

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:14.970
nevermind independence for Algeria

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:18.570
was tantamount to devaluing
the whole significance

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.090
and position of the French state,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:23.280
which is why that War of Independence

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.923
became so incredibly vicious, right?

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.890
Because it had to do with identity,

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:33.090
and identity both within
the former colonized area

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.713
and within the imperial center.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.040
Exploitation is an important part of this,

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.040
and various kinds of
exploitation of near areas

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.053
in terms of empire.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.750
I think there are some parallels here

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:58.653
as well with regard to these three.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.280
When I say exploitation, I'm
not always thinking about it

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.410
in sort of purely material terms,

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.390
though that is a significant part of it,

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:10.230
as I have already described.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:12.150
But it goes further than that.

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.970
It's also making use of
the manpower, for instance,

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.403
for wars, for further wars of expansion.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:23.810
If you look at the number
of Algerians that served

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.283
in France's wars during the
20th century, especially,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:31.760
it's a very, very large number.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.180
The number of Irish people who served

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.500
in various British armies,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.447
sometimes as the front troops for this,

00:33:39.447 --> 00:33:42.333
are also very, very high, right?

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.870
So it's not just about
economic exploitation,

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:50.110
it's also exploitation of the manpower

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.043
that is actually there.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.920
It's also other forms of exploitation.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.790
Sexual exploitation is one part
of this in a gendered sense,

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.853
which I think is really
important to emphasize.

00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:09.890
Its exploitation in terms of
when you have more development

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.570
as you did during the mid-20th century.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.690
Exploitation of resources in terms of

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:22.143
everything from currency to fuel.

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.150
When you think about
imperialist exploitation

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:29.760
in these near contexts,

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.620
you sort of have to take the
smash and grab version, right?

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.560
Of exploitation that most of us think of

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.350
in imperialist terms and magnify it,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:43.470
look at it through a
slightly different lens,

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:48.270
in part because the cases
that I'm talking about here

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.690
were not cases of resources

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:54.060
having to be brought in from afar.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.980
They were pretty close
and easily accessible.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:06.300
So settlement,
incorporation, exploitation.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:11.300
And then finally, cultural hegemony.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.190
I'm gonna dwell on this a little bit

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.530
because I think it is hugely important

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.473
for all three of these cases.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:26.220
So I talked about language
to begin with in this part,

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:32.410
and how language had been
used in order to incorporate

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.140
certainly elites, but after a while,

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.140
to further a field as well
into the imperial project.

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:43.950
Ukraine is of course the best example

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:45.783
that I know of this, right?

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.143
But Ireland and Algeria
would not be far behind.

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.300
Prioritizing the culture
of the colonizer is,

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.483
as Edward Said and others have told us,

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.100
a really important aspect of continuing

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.270
the imperial tradition,

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.970
sort of driving on the kind of issues

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:11.050
that come from the earliest period

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.273
of empire and of imperialism.

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.710
It's also a way in which imperial powers

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.710
almost always create
divisions within the countries

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.360
that they are in control of.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.960
And culture here is
probably more important

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:34.110
than straightforward politics.

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:36.180
It brings us back to what we talked about

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.180
at the beginning of this
lecture in terms of identities,

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:47.510
in terms of discouraging
dissent among the colonized,

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.860
because the cultural
power of the colonizer

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.063
is so much greater.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.880
For instance, we are
international, we are global,

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.770
we are great power, we are super power,

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:03.420
while you are not, right?

00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.503
You are local.

00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:09.000
So culture works in that way, I think,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.070
with regard to imperial projects,

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:14.613
and probably is the
last thing to go, right?

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:19.950
I think it's pretty clear
in the case of Ukraine,

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:24.950
and eminently visible in the
case of Algeria and Ireland.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.663
This is certainly so, and it is an issue.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.480
It's an issue that of course,

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.000
only colonized people after decolonization

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.280
can deal with themselves successfully.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.463
But it is an important issue.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.440
So I wanted to make sure that
we have a little bit of time

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.270
at the end for questions.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.650
So I'm just gonna make some final remarks

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:54.350
first about Russian imperialism
today versus Ukraine.

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.390
But then I think more importantly

00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:59.340
in terms of what I know something about

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.280
how the effects of this
war are going to resonate

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.190
on the Russian side in terms
of dealing with the past

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:13.473
including the deeper past.

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.170
So I have absolutely no doubt,
as you might have guessed,

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:21.840
in terms of how I framed this lecture,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.080
that Russian imperialism
today versus Ukraine

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:29.290
will end in the same way
as England and Ireland

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:35.150
and France in Algeria in decolonization,

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:40.650
in spite of neo-colonial wars.

00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:43.617
So I mean, the Russians in Ukraine in 2022

00:38:43.617 --> 00:38:47.190
are not the first ones who
engage in neo-colonial wars.

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.800
I mean, Algeria, and in my view Ireland,

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.390
are also good examples of it.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.030
You find it in almost
all parts of the world.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:58.920
This idea that if a formal association

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.930
in terms of empire is gone,

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.940
that that's the end of the story.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.703
Almost in all imperial context, not so.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.230
This continues to be problematic

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:13.830
for a very long time after that.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.800
And part of the reason for that, I argue,

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.700
is that these positions are so closely

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.700
bound up in identities,
in core identities,

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:26.070
for many of the people who are involved,

00:39:26.070 --> 00:39:28.410
not just on the side of the colonized,

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.810
but perhaps even more powerfully

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.403
on the side of the colonizers.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.533
And this is what we sometimes
do not understand well enough,

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.620
maybe especially in the Russian case,

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.660
because this has been
including the collapse

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.653
of the Soviet Union, such
a long and outdrawn affair.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.363
This is in many ways
about Russian identity.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.020
And it is, in my view, first and foremost,

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:03.020
identity in Russia in
the sense of an inability

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:05.403
to deal meaningfully with the past.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:11.613
I spent a lot of time in
Moscow in the early 1990s.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.100
As Wiktor said, I worked on
the history of the Cold War.

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:20.100
There was no better
opportunity for a historian

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.620
of the Cold War than to be
in Moscow in the early 1990s

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.240
when the archives started to open up

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.800
and you could get access.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.800
I also then was witness to
how people almost overnight

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:36.270
went from belonging to one
of the two superpowers,

00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:39.810
which gave immense pride to
a lot of people in Russia

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.463
over onto being next to nothing.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.610
People starving, people in Moscow,

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:49.610
elderly people starving to death in 1993.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.610
So that sense of collapse, being déclassé,

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:57.990
everything taken away,

00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:00.420
is a very important reason I think

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:04.350
why Putin has been able to develop Russia

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.100
or not develop Russia in
the direction that he has.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.800
Course also manipulates very effectively,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.933
at least up to the war in Ukraine began,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:17.640
the image globally of the Soviet era

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.940
as a kind of anti-empire,
while in reality,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:24.180
of course the Soviet
Union kept some, not all,

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.180
but some of those visions
of empire relatively intact.

00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:31.950
So what Russia needs, in my view,

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:34.650
probably more than anything
else except regime change,

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:37.203
is a reckoning with the past.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:41.280
Just like there is a
need to discuss slavery

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:43.080
and settler colonialism in Europe

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.650
and in the Americas and elsewhere,

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:50.880
there is also a deep need for
Russians to discuss the effect

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.420
the empire has had on
those at the receiving end,

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.580
but also, and maybe more fundamentally

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.843
on Russians themselves,

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.830
because it's very
difficult, as this country,

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:08.580
United States is slowly realizing

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.700
to be an empire and a republic.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.350
To be an empire, nevermind a democracy,

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:21.350
but even a functioning
republic at the same time.

00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:26.100
So these forms of what I
call hybrid exceptionalism

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:29.940
that Vladimir Putin has been using

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.750
in his war of aggression against Ukraine,

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.170
when Foreign Minister
Lavrov at the beginning

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:41.220
of the conflict spoke about Ukraine

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.420
as being a Russian sphere of
privileged interest, right?

00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:48.360
You can see how that resonates

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.490
with some of these drivers
of Russian imperialism

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:51.930
that I've been talking about today.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:56.370
So on the Russian side, it is
as important to deal with this

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.630
in terms of empire as it is to
deal with it in terms of war.

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:01.980
So that's what I had to say.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.560
And we have time, I think.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.860
Exactly five minutes for questions,

00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:09.810
if there were people who wanted to ask.

00:43:17.322 --> 00:43:18.155
Please.

00:43:18.155 --> 00:43:20.400
- Was there any conflict
between this Russian

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.147
sense of authenticity as
an imperial motivation

00:43:24.147 --> 00:43:26.970
and the fact that many of
the servants of imperialism

00:43:26.970 --> 00:43:28.370
were themselves not Russian?

00:43:31.354 --> 00:43:32.904
- I think there are some links.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:38.340
I mean, one I think is
that it is the imperial

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:42.390
institution in itself
that is unique in a way.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.790
You sort of project it upwards.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:47.790
You can see some tendencies
to that during the Soviet era

00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:50.460
and the post-Soviet era as well,

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:53.673
this idea of inclusive
representation, right?

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.050
People have written whole books about this

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:00.960
comparing the late imperial era in Russia

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.000
and the Soviet Union, right?

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.750
This idea of representing something

00:44:06.750 --> 00:44:09.060
that is much bigger than Russia,

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.700
much bigger than the
Soviet peoples themselves

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:14.340
that is immensely attractive to others.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.720
Now, for most of the time,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.510
it should be said, with
regard to the Russian empire,

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:21.690
that wasn't so, with some bulk exceptions.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:25.140
People were incorporated
into the empire by force

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:26.793
and not by choice, right?

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:32.190
But you can still see
how it could work, right?

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.900
This idea that you
represent some bigger idea

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:39.780
that is not even necessarily
Russian in nature,

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:41.820
but has the Russian state,

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.673
the Russian imperial state
in this case at its center.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.293
Other questions?

00:44:51.293 --> 00:44:52.126
Yeah.

00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:55.140
- [Student] You hinted that
what you think Russia needs

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.080
is regime change and
reckoning with the past.

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.560
Do you think that when
regime change does come,

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.220
they will bring this
reckoning with the past or no?

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:06.600
- I certainly hope so.

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.650
The track record is not particularly good

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.583
with regard to this.

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:17.600
Look, there's been, over
the last 20 years in Russia,

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.940
I'm sure all of you're aware of that,

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:25.560
a very specific set of
attempts of moving away

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:28.440
from dealing with the past
in any meaningful sense.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.210
I mean, to some extent,

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:35.193
that is what the Putin
regime has been about, right?

00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:40.380
A kind of denial of everything
that has happened before.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.940
Not always in a specific sense.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.230
It's very interesting, right?

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:47.700
So as an archival historian,

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.420
I found it fascinating
that in the very last

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.360
two, three years before
the invasion of Ukraine,

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.850
Putin, we know that it was Putin himself,

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:01.023
acted to open up many
archives from the Soviet era.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:05.790
And we don't know the
reason why that was so.

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:07.350
I have a strong suspicion

00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:11.190
that the real reason was
to compare his own regime

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:15.000
favorably with what had been
the failure of the Soviets.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
I mean, Putin, as you will know,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.693
his constituent elements is
that he's an anti-communist.

00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.590
He believes that the communist era,

00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.390
in spite of the little parenthesis

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.673
around the great patriotic war,

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:34.200
that communism was bad for
Russia, bad for Russians.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.074
It might have been good for
other peoples in the empire,

00:46:36.074 --> 00:46:38.790
but it was bad for Russians.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:43.710
So I think you have to have
a pretty significant change,

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:46.170
not just in terms of the regime itself,

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:48.570
which can go in any direction.

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:51.270
I'm not in any way foreseeing
that what comes off

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.243
for Russians necessarily
is better than Putin.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:00.060
But in terms of thinking about the past,

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:03.090
I think it's more significant
in terms of society

00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.240
than it is significant
in terms of the state.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.543
Of course, the state must
not resist it or disallow it,

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.380
but my greatest shock with
regard to the 2014 invasions

00:47:19.608 --> 00:47:23.550
and the 2022 invasions was
how many ordinary Russians

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.493
who were, at least the step
of the way, carried along.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:30.522
Boy, this pack of lies and half truths

00:47:30.522 --> 00:47:35.220
that Putin presented as the
justification for colonial wars.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.520
And that tells me that
there is a lot of work

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.050
among Russians themselves to do,

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:43.320
to understand how they are held back

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.270
by this imperial mindset.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:47.820
Because as I said in the
case of the other examples,

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.150
this always ends badly

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:53.793
when you are gotten to the
early part of the 21st century.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.933
One final question, if there is one.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.680
If not, let me make one
very brief point at the end.

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:12.630
So in this lecture,

00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:17.630
I've tried to look at
sort of the long delay,

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.550
the kind of trajectories
that come out of the past,

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.783
even the deeper past.

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.590
I've not done so trying to tell you

00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.120
that history explains everything.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:28.080
It doesn't.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.900
There are new directions, new trajectories

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.930
that are not necessarily
connected to the past.

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:38.930
But if you wanna try to
understand terms, terminologies,

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:42.123
parts of language, ideas and identities,

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.270
then history can be a great guide,

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:49.710
because history brings
something to the table

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.110
in terms of understanding the present,

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:55.080
which can explain things that otherwise

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.270
would be really, really hard to explain.

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.490
So that's, in a way, my
message in this lecture.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:01.650
Doesn't explain everything.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:03.630
But it's hard to make do without it

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:06.600
because of the things that it
can help you to understand.

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.177
All right, thank you very much.

00:49:08.177 --> 00:49:11.344
(students applauding)

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.340
(soft gentle music)

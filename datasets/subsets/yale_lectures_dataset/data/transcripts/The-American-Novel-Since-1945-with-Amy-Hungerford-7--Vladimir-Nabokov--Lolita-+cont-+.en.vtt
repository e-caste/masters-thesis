Professor Amy
Hungerford:

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:06.400
I want to start my lecture
today looking back to that

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.722
handout I gave you--but didn't
give you a discussion of--a

00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:13.812
couple of days ago,
from that essay Good Readers

00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:18.736
and Good Writers that I
quoted at the very beginning of

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:23.360
class this term.
If you took the time to read

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.489
that, what you saw is Nabokov
meditating on how reader and

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:31.210
writers meet,

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.770
and so I just want to read to
you a little bit from that.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.500
If you still have it,
you can get it out:

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.167
The real writer,
the fellow who sends planets

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:52.569
spinning and models a man asleep
and eagerly tampers with the

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:56.337
sleeper's rib,
that kind of author has no

00:00:56.337 --> 00:01:01.890
given values at his disposal:
he must create them himself.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.891
The art of writing is a very
futile business if it does not

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:09.478
imply first of all the art of
seeing the world as the

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:13.523
potentiality of fiction.
The material of this world may

00:01:13.523 --> 00:01:17.326
be real enough (as far as
reality goes) but it does not

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:21.060
exist at all as an accepted
entirety: it is chaos,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.769
and to this chaos the author
says "go!"

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:27.580
allowing the world to flicker
and to fuse.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.124
It is now recombined in its
very atoms, not merely in its

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.418
visible and superficial parts.
The writer is the first man to

00:01:35.418 --> 00:01:39.350
map it and to name the natural
objects it contains.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.615
Those berries are edible.
That speckled creature that

00:01:43.615 --> 00:01:46.269
bolted across my path might be
tamed.

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:50.590
That lake between those trees
will be called Lake Opal or,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.319
more artistically,
Dishwater Lake.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.650
That mist is a mountain--and
that mountain must be conquered.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.070
Up a trackless slope climbs the
master artist,

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.503
and at the top,
on a windy ridge,

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:08.182
whom do you think he meets?
The panting and happy reader,

00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:12.827
and there they spontaneously
embrace and are linked forever

00:02:12.827 --> 00:02:18.657
if the book lasts forever.
So, this is Nabokov's beautiful

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:24.028
evocation of how writer and
reader meet at the summit of

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:28.129
this misty mountain of the
imagination.

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.239
But, I've been suggesting to
you over the course of the

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.360
lectures so far this term that
this is,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.752
for many books,
a totally idealized sense of

00:02:40.752 --> 00:02:46.662
how a reader encounters it.
And no book demonstrates that

00:02:46.662 --> 00:02:50.502
in quite the same way on our
syllabus as Lolita

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:53.837
itself.
It's true that Black Boy

00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:57.731
was censored,
even after it was published in

00:02:57.731 --> 00:03:01.366
its abbreviated form.
In the '80s it was censored

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.843
from high school libraries,
but Lolita was censored

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:08.259
at the very start in a different
way, and completely.

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.710
If you read,
as I asked you to do,

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.719
the essay at the back,
On a Book Entitled Lolita,

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.672
you'll see,
as Nabokov describes,

00:03:16.672 --> 00:03:18.949
he circulated it to American
publishers,

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.672
four of them,
and it was turned down by

00:03:21.672 --> 00:03:25.828
everybody, finally published in
France by the Olympia Press

00:03:25.828 --> 00:03:29.697
which had also published other
controversial books like

00:03:29.697 --> 00:03:33.710
Naked Lunch and Lady
Chatterley's Lover.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.345
Nabokov cannot meet his
reader on the misty mountain

00:03:39.345 --> 00:03:45.389
because somebody has to agree to
publish this book first;

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.759
it has to exist in the world
before that reader can meet it.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:51.271
And the very fact of
censorship--So,

00:03:51.271 --> 00:03:54.358
the book was published by the
Olympia Press,

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:58.090
and then it was banned in
France and in Britain;

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.631
it was imported into the United
States, and several years later

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:06.759
an American publication was
made.

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.090
And it rocketed to the
bestseller list.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.578
So, it was a very popular book
in the U.S., but it did have

00:04:12.578 --> 00:04:16.126
this history of being banned in
Europe, and it was certainly

00:04:16.126 --> 00:04:19.469
controversial here.
Therefore, the mark of

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:23.300
censorship is actually still on
this book.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.765
The essay that you read was
produced at the behest of his

00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:30.779
French publisher.
They wanted him to write

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:34.589
something that would make people
feel better about the book,

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:39.062
that would give some account of
its origin and give some defense

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:41.759
for its publication and its
content.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.749
And so, we have it bound with
the book, always,

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:48.778
now.
And so, in a way,

00:04:48.778 --> 00:04:51.862
you can say that,
although it's Nabokov's voice,

00:04:51.862 --> 00:04:55.799
and it's adding to the novel
(nothing was taken away from the

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:59.540
novel in the way that half of
Black Boy was removed

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.604
before it was published),
it's still deformed in a

00:05:03.604 --> 00:05:08.680
certain way, or influenced by
the history of that censorship.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.076
Now, I think it's worth
thinking about what he says in

00:05:14.076 --> 00:05:18.913
that essay.
And I'm especially interested

00:05:18.913 --> 00:05:26.303
in this passage on 313 about the
genre fiction of pornography,

00:05:26.303 --> 00:05:31.270
so this is 313,
if you'll turn to it:

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.559
In modern times the term
'pornography' connotes

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.341
mediocrity, commercialism,
and certain strict rules of

00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:46.274
narration.
Obscenity must be mated with

00:05:46.274 --> 00:05:50.350
banality because every kind of
aesthetic enjoyment has to be

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.425
entirely replaced by simple
sexual stimulation which demands

00:05:54.425 --> 00:05:58.639
the traditional word for direct
action upon the patient.

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.023
Old, rigid rules must be
followed by the pornographer in

00:06:02.023 --> 00:06:05.099
order to have his patient feel
the same security of

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.221
satisfaction as,
for example,

00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:11.533
fans of detective stories feel,
stories where if you do not

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:15.250
watch out the real murderer may
turn out to be,

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:18.990
to the fans' disgust,
artistic originality.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.543
Who, for instance,
would want a detective story

00:06:21.543 --> 00:06:25.774
without a single dialogue in it?
Thus, in pornographic novels

00:06:25.774 --> 00:06:29.459
action has to be limited to the
copulation of

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.432
clichés.
Artistic originality turns out

00:06:34.432 --> 00:06:38.579
to be the murderer,
to the fans' disgust.

00:06:38.579 --> 00:06:45.277
Artistic originality here is
likened to the murderer of

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:49.547
convention.
It's originality that destroys

00:06:49.547 --> 00:06:54.952
convention, and here it's given
that frisson of being a

00:06:54.952 --> 00:06:59.203
criminal too.
He's suggesting the criminality

00:06:59.203 --> 00:07:03.589
of real artistic innovation,
and by doing that,

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:08.162
by using that language to
describe artistic originality,

00:07:08.162 --> 00:07:13.149
he allies artistic originality
with the figure of Humbert.

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:16.960
So, there are multiple ways,
at multiple levels,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.420
that Nabokov is defending his
work in this afterword.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.000
For one thing,
he insults the publishers.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.924
He suggests that they didn't
finish the manuscript because,

00:07:27.924 --> 00:07:31.848
when his manuscript turned out
not to be pornographic genre

00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:33.760
fiction,
they stopped reading,

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.117
'cause that's what they wanted,
and they said,

00:07:36.117 --> 00:07:39.620
"This is terrible,"
put it down.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.364
So, he insults the people who
turned down the book in the

00:07:44.364 --> 00:07:48.909
United States;
he allies originality with

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:56.023
criminality, and he suggests
that it is the banal attention

00:07:56.023 --> 00:08:01.634
to convention that is,
in fact, what needs to be

00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:06.009
censored, what needs to be done
away with.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:09.172
He also gives us,
if you notice,

00:08:09.172 --> 00:08:14.681
his little secret map of
Lolita, or so it

00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:20.240
seems as it's presented to us,
his secret map of the scenes

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.420
that delight him in his own
novel, and this is on 316:

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.842
I find it [Lolita]
to be a delightful presence now

00:08:36.842 --> 00:08:40.493
that it quietly hangs about the
house like a summer day which

00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:43.110
one knows to be bright behind
the haze.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.860
[There he's playing with the
name Haze.]

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.541
And when I thus think of
Lolita,

00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:52.773
I seem always to pick out for
special delectation such images

00:08:52.773 --> 00:08:55.914
as Mr.
Taxovich, or that class list of

00:08:55.914 --> 00:08:58.505
Ramsdale School,
or Charlotte saying

00:08:58.505 --> 00:09:01.592
"waterproof,"
or Lolita in slow motion

00:09:01.592 --> 00:09:05.476
advancing towards Humbert's
gifts, or the pictures

00:09:05.476 --> 00:09:09.440
decorating the stylized garret
of Gaston Godin,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.185
or the Kasbeam barber who cost
me a month of work,

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:17.491
or Lolita playing tennis,
or the hospital at Elphinstone,

00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.818
or pale, pregnant,
beloved, irretrievable Dolly

00:09:20.818 --> 00:09:25.243
Schiller dying in Gray Star,
the capital town of the book,

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:29.309
or the tinkling sounds of the
valley town coming up the

00:09:29.309 --> 00:09:33.600
mountain trail on which I caught
the first known female of

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.913
Lycaeides sublivens--[my
Latin is bad]

00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:41.129
Nabokov These are the
nerves of the novel.

00:09:41.129 --> 00:09:44.606
These are the secret points,
the subliminal coordinates by

00:09:44.606 --> 00:09:48.143
means of which the book is
plotted--although I realize very

00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:51.742
clearly that these and other
scenes will be skimmed over and

00:09:51.742 --> 00:09:54.048
not noticed,
or never even reached,

00:09:54.048 --> 00:09:57.342
by those who begin reading the
book under the impression that

00:09:57.342 --> 00:10:00.527
it is something along the lines
of Memoirs of a Woman of

00:10:00.527 --> 00:10:03.424
Pleasure. 
He says these are the scenes,

00:10:03.424 --> 00:10:05.789
and I want you to keep those
scenes in mind.

00:10:05.789 --> 00:10:08.250
Some of them we've already
talked about.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.529
Andrew talked about the class
list and gave you some ways of

00:10:12.529 --> 00:10:16.810
understanding those pictures in
Gaston Godin's apartment.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:20.644
So, we've talked about those.
Today, I'm going to pick up on

00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:24.834
some of those other scenes that
he mentions as his secret points

00:10:24.834 --> 00:10:29.318
of delight in the novel.
What kind of novel do we see if

00:10:29.318 --> 00:10:33.909
we attend to those scenes?
So, what I'm going to do is,

00:10:33.909 --> 00:10:37.365
I'm going to take that
essay--the product of

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:40.567
censorship,
the response to censorship--and

00:10:40.567 --> 00:10:43.850
I'm going to use it to read back
into the novel.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.678
And I want to work with you to
see what we can see,

00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:53.700
if we use those scenes as our
points of reference.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:58.859
And so, our task today will be
to think about that second road

00:10:58.859 --> 00:11:02.811
trip in the novel--so,
this was your reading for

00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:07.500
today--to begin at that second
road trip that Lolita initiates

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.649
and think about what happens to
the novel from there to the end.

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:17.906
Now, the most conspicuous
things that happen are an

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:21.800
increase in the violence of the
novel.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.920
He hits her;
he pushes her;

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.485
he rapes her repeatedly.
We see more of those scenes in

00:11:31.485 --> 00:11:39.940
the second half of the novel.
His style becomes more manic.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:45.521
It gets even funnier.
There are many passages of

00:11:45.521 --> 00:11:50.626
outright comedy in this second
half, especially the shooting of

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:55.271
Quilty,
which is a sort of parody of

00:11:55.271 --> 00:12:02.007
the climax of a crime movie.
So there are all kinds of

00:12:02.007 --> 00:12:08.118
flourishes in the style,
and Humbert presents himself as

00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:12.230
more and more of a hapless
madman.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.250
You can see it in his
perceptions.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:19.707
You can see it in his language.
You can see it in the behavior

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:25.365
he reports, as when he vomits at
the resort in Colorado when he

00:12:25.365 --> 00:12:28.649
thinks that Lolita has gone
away,

00:12:28.649 --> 00:12:31.250
and then he sees her playing
with a dog, and he thinks,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.080
"Oh, if only she would play
with me;

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.775
she's playing with a damn dog,"
and then he's sickened by this

00:12:36.775 --> 00:12:39.666
idea.
You see more of that kind of

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:42.800
physical deterioration.
He drinks more.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:48.220
So, he's getting very desperate.
Lolita, on the other hand,

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.020
becomes more calculating,
and it's this that I want to

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.461
focus in on today:
what becomes of Lolita in this

00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:58.460
second part?
And I want to suggest,

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:02.909
if we turn to page 207 and the
beginning of that trip,

00:13:02.909 --> 00:13:07.295
I want to suggest that in the
second half Lolita takes on the

00:13:07.295 --> 00:13:08.830
role of the artist.

00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:16.847
If you'll recall,
the two of them have a fight

00:13:16.847 --> 00:13:22.791
over her participation in the
play because he suspects her of

00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:27.149
deceiving him somehow:
either with boys,

00:13:27.149 --> 00:13:30.051
or, somehow,
with someone associated with

00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:33.284
the play.
He doesn't quite suspect the

00:13:33.284 --> 00:13:37.980
truth yet, that she has met
Quilty through that play.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.590
So, they have this big fight.
It's raining.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:47.255
She rides her bicycle away into
the rain when the neighbor calls

00:13:47.255 --> 00:13:50.809
to complain about their yelling
at each other.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:55.944
So this is on 206,207:
"In front of the first

00:13:55.944 --> 00:14:03.296
drugstore I saw with what melody
of relief Lolita's fair bicycle

00:14:03.296 --> 00:14:07.146
waiting for her.
I pushed instead of pulling,

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:09.149
pulled, pushed,
pulled and entered."

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:10.288
Okay.
There he is struggling with the

00:14:10.288 --> 00:14:12.595
door.
There is that physical comedy,

00:14:12.595 --> 00:14:15.724
and I'll suggest to you that in
that sentence,

00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:19.548
the pushing and pulling,
you're seeing part of Nabokov's

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:21.814
verbal play.
It's not just,

00:14:21.814 --> 00:14:25.378
sort of, physical comedy
translated into prose,

00:14:25.378 --> 00:14:29.639
but there are a host of other
moments in the novel where

00:14:29.639 --> 00:14:33.668
pushing and pulling figure:
darkly in one of the rape

00:14:33.668 --> 00:14:37.000
scenes (he pushes her in to a
room);

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.252
less darkly at the drugstore
(the soda jerk pulling on the

00:14:42.252 --> 00:14:45.700
levers of the dispenser).
"Look out!"

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.012
Some ten paces away Lolita
through a glass at a telephone

00:14:49.012 --> 00:14:51.259
booth, membranous god still with
us,

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.175
cupping the tube
confidentially,

00:14:53.175 --> 00:14:55.399
hunched over it,
slit her eyes at me,

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:59.322
turned away with her treasure,
hurriedly hang up and walked

00:14:59.322 --> 00:15:02.256
out with a flourish.
So, here now,

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:07.596
we move from Humbert's verbal
flourish, to Lolita's physical

00:15:07.596 --> 00:15:09.299
one:
"Tried to reach you at

00:15:09.299 --> 00:15:12.520
home," she said brightly.
"A great decision has been made.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.625
But first, buy me a drink, Dad."
She watched the listless,

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:19.500
pale fountain girl put in the
ice, pour in the Coke,

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.547
add the cherry syrup,
and my heart was bursting with

00:15:22.547 --> 00:15:25.779
love-ache: that childish wrist!
My lovely child!

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:27.238
"You have a lovely child,
Mr.

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:29.310
Humbert.
We always admire her as she

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.360
passes by."
Mr.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.039
Pim watches Pippa suck the
concoction.

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:37.746
J'ai toujours admire la
supreme l'oeuvre ormonde du

00:15:37.746 --> 00:15:40.848
sublime Dublinois.
And in the meantime the rain

00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:42.909
had become a voluptuous
shower.

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:48.379
So, here is his verbal ecstasy
as he watches her:

00:15:48.379 --> 00:15:51.070
"Look," she said as she
rode the bike beside me,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.660
one foot scraping the darkly
glistening sidewalk.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.010
"Look.
I've decided something.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:57.050
I want to leave school.
I hate that school.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.530
I hate the play.
I really do.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.370
Never go back.
Find another.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.850
Leave at once.
Go for a long trip again,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.380
but this time we'll go wherever
I want, won't we?"

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.350
I nodded.
My Lolita.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.059
'I choose;
c'est entendu?"

00:16:11.059 --> 00:16:13.669
she said, wobbling a little
beside me.

00:16:13.669 --> 00:16:17.880
Used French only when she was a
very good little girl.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.678
"Okay, Entendu.
Now hop, hop,

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.639
hop, Lenore,
or you'll get soaked."

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:25.419
A storm of sobs was filling my
chest.

00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:28.945
She bared her teeth and after
her adorable schoolgirl fashion

00:16:28.945 --> 00:16:30.884
leaned forward,
and away she sped,

00:16:30.884 --> 00:16:33.441
my bird.
Miss Lester's finely groomed

00:16:33.441 --> 00:16:37.275
hand held the porch door open
for a wobbling old dog qui

00:16:37.275 --> 00:16:41.242
prenait son temps. Lo was
waiting for me near the ghostly

00:16:41.242 --> 00:16:43.668
birch tree.
"I'm drenched," she declared at

00:16:43.668 --> 00:16:45.530
the top of her voice.
"Are you glad?

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.440
To hell with the play!
See what I mean?"

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:52.309
An invisible hag's claw slammed
down an upper floor window.

00:16:52.309 --> 00:16:55.395
In our hallway,
ablaze with welcoming lights,

00:16:55.395 --> 00:16:57.850
my Lolita peeled off her
sweater,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:02.004
shook her gemmed hair,
stretched towards me two bare

00:17:02.004 --> 00:17:06.789
arms, raised one knee.
"Carry me upstairs, please.

00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:10.789
I feel sort of romantic
tonight." 

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:16.205
She's seducing him in this
scene, so the flourish passes

00:17:16.205 --> 00:17:19.943
from his prose.
It's not gone from his prose,

00:17:19.943 --> 00:17:22.149
but in this scene,
very clearly,

00:17:22.149 --> 00:17:25.279
it passes from his prose into
her acting.

00:17:25.279 --> 00:17:30.482
And Humbert reflects that her
work in the play has trained her

00:17:30.482 --> 00:17:35.631
into certain affectations.
Unfortunately for him,

00:17:35.631 --> 00:17:39.900
he doesn't exactly spot this
one.

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.436
She, now, is using the
clichés of romance to

00:17:44.436 --> 00:17:49.970
seduce him into following her
map for their second journey,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.107
starting out on the second
journey by calling forth all his

00:17:55.107 --> 00:17:57.902
mad love for her,
so that he will be,

00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:01.300
in a sense, blinded by that and
not see her machinations.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:17.319
You see it again on 209,
a little later in this scene.

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:21.450
His suspicion is aroused when a
car pulls up next to them as

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.550
they're heading out of town.

00:18:28.059 --> 00:18:34.778
It's Edusa Gold driving up next
to them, and he's asking who was

00:18:34.778 --> 00:18:40.750
it exactly that had been
impressed by Lolita's acting.

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.945
And Lolita takes him to mean,
who was the person in the car

00:18:44.945 --> 00:18:48.128
next to them,
not who was the person that the

00:18:48.128 --> 00:18:50.950
person in the car was referring
to.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.859
"I was not referring to
her."

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:54.650
"Who, exactly,
concocted that play?"

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.657
"Oh, yes, of course.
Some old woman,

00:18:56.657 --> 00:19:00.032
Claire something I guess.
There was quite a crowd of them

00:19:00.032 --> 00:19:01.630
there."
"So she complimented you."

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.494
"Complimented, my eye.
She kissed me on my pure brow,"

00:19:05.494 --> 00:19:09.069
and my darling emitted that new
yelp of merriment which,

00:19:09.069 --> 00:19:13.638
perhaps in connection with her
theatrical mannerisms,

00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:17.240
she had lately begun to
affect." 

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.569
And I just want to skip down to
the bottom of that paragraph.

00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:25.771
He gives her a kind of
warning--which I'm going to talk

00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:30.049
about in a little while--but at
the very end he says,

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:32.320
"The tour of your thigh,
you know, should not exceed

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.290
seventeen-and-a-half inches."
He's warning her not to grow

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:37.620
up, essentially:
"'More might be fatal.'

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.204
I was kidding of course.
We are now setting out on a

00:19:40.204 --> 00:19:41.849
long, happy journey.
I rememberâ€¦."

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:44.190
And then, look at the paragraph
break there.

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.829
"I remember as a childâ€¦"
Now, this is not in quotes: 

00:19:48.829 --> 00:19:52.657
I remember as a child in
Europe gloating over a map of

00:19:52.657 --> 00:19:55.900
North America that had
Appalachian mountains boldly

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.819
running from Alabama up to New
Brunswick,

00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:01.813
so that the whole region they
spanned, Tennessee to Virginias,

00:20:01.813 --> 00:20:03.686
Pennsylvania,
New York, Vermont,

00:20:03.686 --> 00:20:07.157
New Hampshire and Maine,
appeared to my imagination as a

00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:10.440
gigantic Switzerland or even
Tibet: all mountain,

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.779
glorious diamond peak upon
peak.

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:17.485
This is the realm of that
mountain of imagination that I

00:20:17.485 --> 00:20:22.533
was showing you in the passage
from Good Readers and Good

00:20:22.533 --> 00:20:25.630
Writers.
This is Humbert's

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:31.248
meditation on looking at a map
and seeing a range in which

00:20:31.248 --> 00:20:35.852
imagination can have pure play.
Now, as it turns out,

00:20:35.852 --> 00:20:39.193
if you keep reading there,
he's disappointed to find what

00:20:39.193 --> 00:20:42.594
the Appalachian mountains
actually look like in the United

00:20:42.594 --> 00:20:45.192
States.
He finds them much less

00:20:45.192 --> 00:20:49.775
romantic, a kind of garbage
dump, a very seedy stretch of

00:20:49.775 --> 00:20:53.698
the world.
But what I want you to note is

00:20:53.698 --> 00:20:59.607
how that chapter break brings us
from Lolita's first efforts at

00:20:59.607 --> 00:21:03.609
motivating the romantic
clichés;

00:21:03.609 --> 00:21:09.146
her first efforts immediately
pay off in transporting him into

00:21:09.146 --> 00:21:15.552
that mountainous imagination.
This is how we know that she's

00:21:15.552 --> 00:21:17.890
got him;
she's got him in the

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:21.654
imagination.
She's not just seduced his

00:21:21.654 --> 00:21:25.919
lustful body.
She has him fully under her

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:30.583
power at this point,
and it's that chapter break

00:21:30.583 --> 00:21:34.849
that you can see demonstrating
the fact.

00:21:34.849 --> 00:21:39.980
Now, I want to look at page
231,232.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:44.148
This is one of those passages
that Nabokov points out as being

00:21:44.148 --> 00:21:47.300
special to him.
This is Lolita playing tennis.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:21:57.860
So, 231.

00:22:05.519 --> 00:22:08.779
"My Lolita"--this is near the
bottom of the page:

00:22:08.779 --> 00:22:12.007
â€¦had a way of
raising her bent left knee at

00:22:12.007 --> 00:22:15.000
the ample and springy start of
the service cycle,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.075
when there would develop and
hang in the sun for a second a

00:22:18.075 --> 00:22:20.250
vital web of balance between
toed foot,

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.236
pristine armpit,
burnished arm,

00:22:22.236 --> 00:22:25.878
and far back-flung racket as
she smiled up with gleaming

00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:29.520
teeth at the small globe
suspended so high in the zenith

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.361
of the powerful and graceful
cosmos she had created for the

00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:37.069
express purpose of falling upon
it with a clean,

00:22:37.069 --> 00:22:41.170
resounding crack of her golden
whip.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.735
It had that serve of hers
beauty, directness,

00:22:43.735 --> 00:22:46.650
youth, a classical purity of
trajectory and was,

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.148
despite its spanking pace,
fairly easy to return,

00:22:50.148 --> 00:22:53.720
having as it did no twist or
sting to its long,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:59.786
elegant hop." 
And then a little further down

00:22:59.786 --> 00:23:03.413
the page: "She who was so cruel
and crafty in everyday life

00:23:03.413 --> 00:23:05.789
revealed an innocence of
frankness,

00:23:05.789 --> 00:23:09.426
a kindness of ball playing that
permitted a second-rate but

00:23:09.426 --> 00:23:12.953
determined player,
no matter how uncouth and

00:23:12.953 --> 00:23:17.500
incompetent, to poke and cut his
way to victory."

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:22.003
That pose--the pose of tennis
service, the raised foot--it's

00:23:22.003 --> 00:23:26.659
the same pose she uses to seduce
him in that scene I just read

00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:29.865
after their fight:
"I feel sort of romantic

00:23:29.865 --> 00:23:33.610
tonight."
She is acting out a form:

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:38.395
in the first case the form of
romantic fiction,

00:23:38.395 --> 00:23:44.694
the heroine who swoons back;
in this scene the form of the

00:23:44.694 --> 00:23:48.299
game, the perfect form of
tennis.

00:23:48.299 --> 00:23:54.170
And he says she did a perfect
imitation of top-notch tennis.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.113
This is on 231:
"Her form was indeed an

00:23:57.113 --> 00:24:01.683
absolutely perfect imitation of
absolutely top-notch tennis,

00:24:01.683 --> 00:24:04.549
without any utilitarian
results."

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:07.579
It's perfect tennis,
but she never wins.

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:12.831
And he reflects on 232:
"Had not something within her

00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:17.779
been broken by me,
not that I realized it then,

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:22.296
she would have had on top of
her perfect form the will to win

00:24:22.296 --> 00:24:25.759
and would have become a real
girl champion."

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:30.463
He reads the non-utilitarian
quality of her form as the

00:24:30.463 --> 00:24:36.057
evidence of her broken nature.
But I would like to suggest

00:24:36.057 --> 00:24:41.776
that it's precisely that
non-utilitarian quality that is

00:24:41.776 --> 00:24:46.559
the mark of her wholeness in a
certain way.

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:52.150
If aesthetic bliss is what
Nabokov confesses is his

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:57.741
ultimate aim for art in the
essay On a Book Entitled

00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:01.384
Lolita,
something like that is what

00:25:01.384 --> 00:25:06.312
Lolita gives us in her perfect
tennis form without the will to

00:25:06.312 --> 00:25:10.488
win: the frankness,
beauty, kindness,

00:25:10.488 --> 00:25:14.838
lack of deception.
And, in that sense,

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:19.404
it is also a version of play,
of children's play--not

00:25:19.404 --> 00:25:23.356
competitive play,
which is a different kind of

00:25:23.356 --> 00:25:28.212
thing--but pure play.
And this gets us back again to

00:25:28.212 --> 00:25:33.442
that image of the chess problem
that I was talking about in my

00:25:33.442 --> 00:25:37.943
first lecture.
The chess problem is not in the

00:25:37.943 --> 00:25:40.935
middle of a game.
It's a puzzle,

00:25:40.935 --> 00:25:45.575
but it has for its delight a
kind of solitary quality,

00:25:45.575 --> 00:25:51.089
both of the composer and of the
solver of the chess problem.

00:25:51.089 --> 00:25:54.325
So, it's not in the course of
competitive play,

00:25:54.325 --> 00:25:57.912
and--although he uses the
language of competition to

00:25:57.912 --> 00:26:01.640
describe the relationship
between the composer and the

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.579
solver--it's not in that sense a
competitive game,

00:26:05.579 --> 00:26:08.690
as chess would be:
white against black.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:14.796
This kind of self-absorbed,
autonomous play of Lolita's

00:26:14.796 --> 00:26:20.790
tennis form is the kind of play
that children have.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:25.740
It doesn't have a point.
It's all process and form.

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.752
If the threat to the work
of art, to the novel,

00:26:29.752 --> 00:26:35.049
is something like convention,
I want to think hard about what

00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:39.490
the threat to this kind of play
is in the novel.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.931
And I want to suggest that the
threat to this kind of play is

00:26:43.931 --> 00:26:46.670
parallel to the threat to
children.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:50.170
The threat to children in the
novel multiplies.

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:55.184
It is not just Lolita who is
threatened, but all sorts of

00:26:55.184 --> 00:26:57.899
children.
So, let's begin with

00:26:57.899 --> 00:27:02.224
another of those scenes on 213
that Nabokov points out to us,

00:27:02.224 --> 00:27:05.776
the Kasbeam barber.
Why did it take him a month to

00:27:05.776 --> 00:27:10.823
come up with the Kasbeam barber?
What's going on in this tiny

00:27:10.823 --> 00:27:15.170
snippet that's so important?
So here it is.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:18.133
In Kasbeam,
a very old barber gave me a

00:27:18.133 --> 00:27:20.751
very mediocre haircut.
He babbled of a

00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:24.422
baseball-playing son of his,
and at every explodent spat

00:27:24.422 --> 00:27:27.129
into my neck,
and every now and then wiped

00:27:27.129 --> 00:27:30.466
his glasses on my sheet wrap,
or interrupted his tremulous

00:27:30.466 --> 00:27:33.569
scissor work to produce faded
newspaper clippings.

00:27:33.569 --> 00:27:37.012
And so inattentive was I,
that it came as a shock to

00:27:37.012 --> 00:27:40.792
realize, as he pointed to an
easeled photograph among the

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:44.435
ancient gray lotions,
that the mustached young

00:27:44.435 --> 00:27:49.160
ballplayer had been dead for the
last thirty years.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.933
So, the barber is speaking
about his son in such a way that

00:27:53.933 --> 00:27:56.237
he seems alive,
but, in fact,

00:27:56.237 --> 00:27:59.822
he's dead.
So here is one dead child

00:27:59.822 --> 00:28:04.200
playing baseball,
or the memory of him playing

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:07.799
baseball is alive with his
father.

00:28:07.799 --> 00:28:11.208
If you look down at the very
bottom of that page,

00:28:11.208 --> 00:28:15.538
you see "a young woman far gone
in the family way had seated a

00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:19.160
rapt baby on a swing and was
rocking it gently,

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.714
while a jealous boy of two or
three was making a nuisance of

00:28:22.714 --> 00:28:26.208
himself by trying to push or
pull"--there is that word play

00:28:26.208 --> 00:28:28.980
again coming back to us--"the
swing board.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:33.404
He finally succeeded in getting
himself knocked down by it and

00:28:33.404 --> 00:28:37.683
bawled loudly as he lay supine
on the grass while his mother

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.309
continued to smile gently at
neither of her present

00:28:41.309 --> 00:28:44.373
children."
And, if you skip over to 215,

00:28:44.373 --> 00:28:47.654
this image comes back of this
mother: "All cars had

00:28:47.654 --> 00:28:50.279
disappeared except his station
wagon.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:55.371
His pregnant young wife was now
getting into it with her baby

00:28:55.371 --> 00:28:59.190
and the other more or less
canceled child."

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:03.873
So, here are at least three
examples of canceled children,

00:29:03.873 --> 00:29:07.865
and you can use that phrase,
I think, to characterize

00:29:07.865 --> 00:29:10.920
Lolita.
She is a canceled child.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:16.460
Her childhood is stolen from
her by Humbert.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.326
In this scene,
it is the mother's imaginative

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:25.972
preoccupation,
in a sense, that cancels her

00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:29.658
children,
and you can ask whether she is

00:29:29.658 --> 00:29:33.779
preoccupied with the idea of the
new child within her.

00:29:33.779 --> 00:29:39.348
You get that sense of pregnancy
being an inner meaning or an

00:29:39.348 --> 00:29:43.276
inner significance,
and perhaps it's a figure for

00:29:43.276 --> 00:29:46.564
what preoccupies her,
for the world of imagination

00:29:46.564 --> 00:29:49.799
and possibility.
But she has that kind of

00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:54.172
distant internal smile.
This is the same kind of smile

00:29:54.172 --> 00:29:59.239
that Lolita is said to have--the
beautiful passage where Humbert

00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:04.225
remembers Lolita's famous smile
that ranges around the room but

00:30:04.225 --> 00:30:09.049
doesn't seem to engage anyone.
It's as if her smile is the

00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:13.811
response to an internal imagined
life, one that's inaccessible to

00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:16.874
Humbert.
He says of her he does not know

00:30:16.874 --> 00:30:20.349
what regions there were in her
mind, what "dim,

00:30:20.349 --> 00:30:25.279
adorable regions" there were in
her mind, that he would never

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:28.320
know, that he was denied access
to,

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:35.620
as he raped her.
And so, children--which

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:42.240
have this potential to play--are
consistently canceled,

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:47.150
over and over again.
There are other examples.

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:53.017
On 223 we find out that Mona,
Lolita's friend from the play,

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:58.288
her baby sibling--we're not
told whether it's a boy or

00:30:58.288 --> 00:31:01.833
girl--dies,
and we see it in one of those

00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:03.320
parentheticals,
223.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.262
This is Mona's letter.
"Now that everything is over,

00:31:08.262 --> 00:31:09.851
school, play,
the Roy mess,

00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:13.208
mother's confinement (our baby,
alas, did not live),

00:31:13.208 --> 00:31:17.045
it all seems a long time ago,
though practically I still bear

00:31:17.045 --> 00:31:21.579
traces of the paint."
Again, that parenthetical

00:31:21.579 --> 00:31:27.582
elides the death of the child.
We're reminded in this scene of

00:31:27.582 --> 00:31:30.380
the death of Lolita's little
brother.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:35.917
Remember, Charlotte Haze speaks
in her letter of a lost son who

00:31:35.917 --> 00:31:40.944
died at the age of two.
The bodies of children pile up,

00:31:40.944 --> 00:31:44.640
but other things happen to
children too.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:49.821
Remember when Lolita and
Humbert are partially discovered

00:31:49.821 --> 00:31:54.354
having sex in a field by a
mother and her children

00:31:54.354 --> 00:31:59.592
gathering flowers.
They're described as carved,

00:31:59.592 --> 00:32:05.096
bluestone children.
And think about the name of

00:32:05.096 --> 00:32:10.813
that town, Elphinstone,
of which Nabokov again is

00:32:10.813 --> 00:32:15.935
proud: Elphinstone,
a little child of stone,

00:32:15.935 --> 00:32:21.074
a small figure of stone.
And the elf-like image is

00:32:21.074 --> 00:32:24.509
something that he applies to
Lolita over and over.

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:27.458
So, what you see is
children dead,

00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:31.682
children turned to stone,
and this is the dark side of

00:32:31.682 --> 00:32:36.623
that fairy tale quality that we
see in other parts of the novel

00:32:36.623 --> 00:32:40.289
that's been coming back in our
lectures.

00:32:40.289 --> 00:32:41.940
These are children turned to
stone.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.691
And it suggests,
if you go back now to that

00:32:50.691 --> 00:32:56.780
scene on 207-208,
as they set out for the second

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:04.035
trip in the middle of the page
(actually a little above):

00:33:04.035 --> 00:33:11.550
" I was toying with the idea of
gently trickling across the

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:16.468
Mexican border.
I was braver now than last

00:33:16.468 --> 00:33:21.166
year, and there deciding what to
do with my little concubine who

00:33:21.166 --> 00:33:24.819
was now 60 inches tall and
weighed 90 pounds."

00:33:24.819 --> 00:33:30.319
The threat against Lolita is
growing with her body;

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:35.346
as she gets bigger,
so he becomes murderous towards

00:33:35.346 --> 00:33:38.828
her.
And this is allied with his

00:33:38.828 --> 00:33:44.160
desire, in a sense,
to crystalize what he has taken

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.132
from her.
And here in the middle of the

00:33:47.132 --> 00:33:49.983
page a little ways down:
My love's striped

00:33:49.983 --> 00:33:52.593
black-and-white cotton frock,
jaunty blue cap,

00:33:52.593 --> 00:33:56.130
white socks and brown moccasins
were not quite in keeping with

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:59.874
the large,
beautifully cut aquamarine on a

00:33:59.874 --> 00:34:05.717
silver chainlet which gemmed her
throat, a spring rain gift from

00:34:05.717 --> 00:34:09.611
me.
He has taken summer rain that

00:34:09.611 --> 00:34:12.296
the page before,
we are told,

00:34:12.296 --> 00:34:16.420
gemmed her hair ("shook her
gemmed hair,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:19.900
stretched towards me two bare
arms, raised one knee")--"her

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.321
gemmed hair"--takes that rain,
and ossifies it,

00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:27.262
makes it lapidary,
turns it to stone in the

00:34:27.262 --> 00:34:31.110
aquamarine, and puts it on a
chainlet.

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:37.123
And the diminutive "let" at the
end of the chain doesn't really

00:34:37.123 --> 00:34:42.826
cover up the chain itself.
It doesn't really mitigate

00:34:42.826 --> 00:34:49.030
against the confinement he has
perpetrated on Lolita.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.835
She is in chains,
and just because it's

00:34:51.835 --> 00:34:55.230
ornamented, just because it has
the diminutive,

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:58.110
doesn't mean that it's not a
chain.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:01.500
It's around her throat,
that vulnerable place.

00:35:04.579 --> 00:35:09.467
So, if art as play is
something like performance,

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:14.953
something like an embodied art,
the art of the tennis service,

00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:19.642
or even the art of theater or
film, there is another kind of

00:35:19.642 --> 00:35:25.799
art that is gemlike,
hard, cold, equally formal but

00:35:25.799 --> 00:35:33.582
dead: "bluestone children."
So, this is the other form that

00:35:33.582 --> 00:35:39.081
the aesthetic can take.
And I think that Nabokov is

00:35:39.081 --> 00:35:44.668
consistently concerned about
these two valences of what the

00:35:44.668 --> 00:35:50.219
aesthetic can look like.
So, if it can look like the

00:35:50.219 --> 00:35:55.670
gem, it can last forever.
As Humbert dreams at the very

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:59.539
end of the novel,
he says, "I am thinking of

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:04.246
aurochs and angels,
the secret of durable pigments,

00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:07.412
prophetic sonnets,
the refuge of art,

00:36:07.412 --> 00:36:12.250
as this is the only immortality
you and I may share,

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:17.652
my Lolita."
He thinks of his account as

00:36:17.652 --> 00:36:24.074
that kind of enduring stone-like
object, and it may give

00:36:24.074 --> 00:36:31.429
immortality, but it traps her
there in immortality with him.

00:36:31.429 --> 00:36:39.579
He is then as immortal as she
is in the pages of this screed.

00:36:39.579 --> 00:36:45.206
And so--like the chainlet--it
takes that stone-like

00:36:45.206 --> 00:36:50.045
distillation of life,
turning rain to stone,

00:36:50.045 --> 00:36:54.659
turning life to the
representation by your

00:36:54.659 --> 00:36:58.878
tormentor.
It turns into something durable

00:36:58.878 --> 00:37:03.592
that will outlast them.
So, the problem with art is in

00:37:03.592 --> 00:37:09.840
a sense that it is immortal.
That's the problem.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:16.480
If life is threatened over and
over again in this novel by

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:22.772
mortality--dead children,
Lolita growing up inevitably,

00:37:22.772 --> 00:37:27.570
painfully, putting her at risk.
Her body grows;

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.170
she can't do anything about
it--that's mortality,

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:34.311
the passage of time.
This difference--between

00:37:34.311 --> 00:37:37.561
the art that's lapidary and the
art that's living--is that the

00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:40.711
art that's living,
by very virtue of being alive,

00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:41.660
can also die.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:47.250
So, this is the problem with
the autonomous work of art.

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:51.068
If your dream as a writer is to
make an autonomous work of art

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:54.010
that has, as we say in a very
colloquial way,

00:37:54.010 --> 00:38:02.477
a life of its own,
but the problem is that there

00:38:02.477 --> 00:38:13.467
is something about life that's
dependent on the possibility of

00:38:13.467 --> 00:38:19.247
its negation.
That's why on Valentine's Day

00:38:19.247 --> 00:38:24.590
you might give your lover real
flowers rather than plastic

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:28.182
ones.
It's the very potential to

00:38:28.182 --> 00:38:33.780
decay that makes them beautiful.
And so, the problem here is

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.951
that Nabokov dreams of an art
that's living,

00:38:36.951 --> 00:38:41.523
something like the butterflies
that he was so enchanted with in

00:38:41.523 --> 00:38:44.619
his life and work outside of
fiction.

00:38:44.619 --> 00:38:48.581
And the butterfly does appear
in just one moment,

00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:51.469
and it's during the tennis
scene.

00:38:51.469 --> 00:38:55.732
As Humbert and Lolita play,
there is one butterfly that

00:38:55.732 --> 00:39:00.569
flits between them.
It's a mark of their equality

00:39:00.569 --> 00:39:06.181
as artists in that moment.
The butterfly is the perfect

00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:11.770
work of art because it is both a
representation and alive.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:16.969
It has eyes on its wings.
It looks like a leaf.

00:39:16.969 --> 00:39:23.194
It is nature in its aesthetic
form as imitation of itself,

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:26.580
life as an imitation of life.

00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:34.786
Can you make a novel,
as he says in the essay,

00:39:34.786 --> 00:39:41.028
that will "sprout wings and
grow claws" in secret in his

00:39:41.028 --> 00:39:44.724
mind?
That's an image taken from the

00:39:44.724 --> 00:39:49.449
metamorphosis of the butterfly
within the chrysalis.

00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:53.362
He wants his novel to be
like that living butterfly,

00:39:53.362 --> 00:39:57.132
but the threat is always that
it will be more like the

00:39:57.132 --> 00:39:59.877
aquamarine.
And I want to suggest to you

00:39:59.877 --> 00:40:03.590
that the aquamarine has an even
darker personal significance to

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:06.186
him.
When his family fled Russia,

00:40:06.186 --> 00:40:10.928
the only things of value that
they brought with them were some

00:40:10.928 --> 00:40:15.311
of his mother's jewels.
These jewels were hidden in a

00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:19.871
canister of talcum powder,
later buried in the yard under

00:40:19.871 --> 00:40:24.594
a tree in Europe as they moved
from place to place in their

00:40:24.594 --> 00:40:28.570
exile,
and they were gradually sold

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:32.420
off one by one to fund their
life.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.426
Those jewels,
I would suggest to you,

00:40:35.426 --> 00:40:39.936
carried with them the sense
that they were the ossified

00:40:39.936 --> 00:40:43.110
remains of a radiant Russian
life,

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:49.203
and so the image of the jewel
is a kind of dead childhood,

00:40:49.203 --> 00:40:53.719
even for him as a writer.
So, where is Nabokov in here?

00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:59.809
I think that's one of the
places where Nabokov is.

00:40:59.809 --> 00:41:04.809
It's Nabokov meditating on this
problem.

00:41:04.809 --> 00:41:11.103
I want to read that last
passage on 308 that he mentions

00:41:11.103 --> 00:41:12.820
in the essay.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:21.889
Actually, it starts on 307.
This is Humbert standing on the

00:41:21.889 --> 00:41:26.784
lip of a ravine by the side of
the road, listening to the

00:41:26.784 --> 00:41:30.630
sounds of a small town rising up
to him:

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:34.335
And soon I realized that
all of these sounds were of one

00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:38.101
nature, that no other sounds but
these came from the streets of

00:41:38.101 --> 00:41:41.862
the transparent town,
with the women at home and the

00:41:41.862 --> 00:41:44.652
men away.
Reader, what I heard was but

00:41:44.652 --> 00:41:48.300
the melody of children at play,
nothing but that,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.606
and so limpid was the air that
within this vapor of blended

00:41:51.606 --> 00:41:55.021
voices majestic and minute,
remote and magically near,

00:41:55.021 --> 00:41:59.019
frank and divinely enigmatic,
one could hear now and then,

00:41:59.019 --> 00:42:02.579
as if released,
an almost inarticulate spurt of

00:42:02.579 --> 00:42:07.146
vivid laughter or the crack of a
bat or the clatter of a toy

00:42:07.146 --> 00:42:09.651
wagon,
but it was all really too far

00:42:09.651 --> 00:42:13.233
for the eye to distinguish any
movement in the lightly etched

00:42:13.233 --> 00:42:15.565
streets.
I stood listening to that

00:42:15.565 --> 00:42:19.385
musical vibration from my lofty
slope, to those flashes of

00:42:19.385 --> 00:42:23.539
separate cries with a kind of
demure murmur for background,

00:42:23.539 --> 00:42:28.178
and then I knew that the
hopelessly poignant thing was

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:31.329
not Lolita's absence from my
side,

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:36.430
but the absence of her voice
from that concord.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.659
This then is my story.
I have reread it.

00:42:38.659 --> 00:42:40.720
It has bits of marrow sticking
to it.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.903
And blood.
And beautiful,

00:42:42.903 --> 00:42:49.369
bright-green flies.
The living voice is missing.

00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:53.464
What you get instead is the
corpse of the novel,

00:42:53.464 --> 00:42:56.599
with marrow,
and blood, and flies.

00:42:56.599 --> 00:43:03.730
Dolly Schiller--aptly named of
course for the German Romantic

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:10.860
philosopher who advocated play
as a mode of the aesthetic,

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:16.488
German Romanticist of the
nineteenth century--Dolly takes

00:43:16.488 --> 00:43:20.710
on that identity as the Romantic
figure,

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:27.400
and she dies giving birth to a
girl, to a baby girl;

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:30.313
she dies in childbed.
Remember I asked you from

00:43:30.313 --> 00:43:33.659
the preface, John Ray's preface,
to figure out who Dolly

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:35.909
Schiller is, who dies in
childbed.

00:43:35.909 --> 00:43:40.210
Well, by now you should know
that's Lolita.

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:44.389
So she dies giving birth to a
child.

00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:48.765
She has taken on the mantle of
Romantic artist,

00:43:48.765 --> 00:43:53.996
but she dies giving birth to a
live person: two modes of

00:43:53.996 --> 00:43:58.933
creativity embodied in Lolita,
in that one act,

00:43:58.933 --> 00:44:04.014
and in that name.
She is giving birth to a real,

00:44:04.014 --> 00:44:09.288
live thing--not a creation that
is more like stone,

00:44:09.288 --> 00:44:13.877
but an actual person.
And so, what you see is not

00:44:13.877 --> 00:44:18.677
just the paradox of wanting your
work of art to be a living work

00:44:18.677 --> 00:44:21.614
of art,
to be personified in that way

00:44:21.614 --> 00:44:25.587
or made animate that then
exposes it to mortality--the

00:44:25.587 --> 00:44:30.085
Woolworth's workers who don't
read it and who think no one in

00:44:30.085 --> 00:44:37.699
the world ever reads it,
that kind of risk.

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:41.198
Your book cannot live if it has
no reader to meet it at the top

00:44:41.198 --> 00:44:44.724
of that mountain.
But Dolly embodies that other

00:44:44.724 --> 00:44:49.126
kind of creativeness:
human creativity of the literal

00:44:49.126 --> 00:44:54.693
kind, giving birth to a child.
I think it's telling that this

00:44:54.693 --> 00:44:59.635
kind of creation is a failure;
it cannot succeed in the

00:44:59.635 --> 00:45:06.110
confines of this novel.
Nabokov had a way of making an

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:12.710
absence at a point of his utmost
investment.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.057
For instance,
in his autobiography he notes

00:45:16.057 --> 00:45:20.839
the date of and the phone call
that tells his mother that his

00:45:20.839 --> 00:45:24.960
father has been assassinated.
But he doesn't tell you until

00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.889
many pages later what it was
that happened on that date.

00:45:27.889 --> 00:45:30.239
He says, "On" whatever the date
was;

00:45:30.239 --> 00:45:32.300
I think it was March 22^(nd)
"when my mother received a phone

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.217
callâ€¦."
And then, it just goes on about

00:45:34.217 --> 00:45:36.025
something else,
doesn't tell you what that

00:45:36.025 --> 00:45:38.926
phone call was.
It was his father's

00:45:38.926 --> 00:45:43.709
assassination.
Like those absences in other

00:45:43.709 --> 00:45:48.388
parts of his writing,
I think this absence,

00:45:48.388 --> 00:45:54.939
this failure of any birth,
it marks a sort of vanishing

00:45:54.939 --> 00:45:59.800
point of art,
that art somehow can't quite

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:05.847
compete with the real
inventiveness of nature and of

00:46:05.847 --> 00:46:10.030
human persons.
He's going to try.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.357
He's going to try to give us a
living prose,

00:46:13.357 --> 00:46:18.000
but this is the end against
which it finds itself pressed.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.297
Next time, we're turning to a
very different kind of writing,

00:46:30.297 --> 00:46:34.417
a writing equally preoccupied
with its relationship to the

00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:37.312
world,
to life, but very differently

00:46:37.312 --> 00:46:41.069
approaching that problem.
So, try to think about that as

00:46:41.069 --> 00:46:42.735
you turn to On the Road.

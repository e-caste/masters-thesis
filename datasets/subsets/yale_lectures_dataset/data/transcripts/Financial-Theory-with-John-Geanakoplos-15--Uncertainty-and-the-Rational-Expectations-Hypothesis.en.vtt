00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.830
Prof: Okay,
I think I'll start.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.240
So we considered for a long
time a world of certainty.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.340
Hope something's okay.
 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.621
Considered a world of certainty
where we assumed we could

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:15.077
foresee the future perfectly,
and we still managed to figure

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.070
out fairly interesting things.
 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.350
But the world is much more
complicated than that.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.709
It's a world of uncertainty,
and in a world of uncertainty,

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:28.768
economics comes into its own,
I think, as a fascinating

00:00:28.768 --> 00:00:29.670
subject.
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.540
So I spent a little time
reviewing some mathematics for

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.040
you last time that many of you
already knew,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.048
so I'm going to take that for
granted going forward and just

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.364
start over,
this time from an economic

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:44.040
perspective instead of a
mathematical perspective.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.713
So suppose today that we assume
that you could buy a stock today

00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:55.904
whose price tomorrow could be
104 or 98 with 50:50

00:00:55.904 --> 00:01:01.201
probabilities and we assume that
everybody knew the

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.320
probabilities.
 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:19.016
Know probabilities and maximize
expected payoff next period,

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:20.879
okay?
 

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:30.590
Well, payoff this period.
 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.810
If we assumed--and we're going
to drop this assumption,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.300
but I'm going to keep it for a
little while--

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.114
if we assumed that all people
cared about was their expected

00:01:37.114 --> 00:01:39.977
payoff next period and of course
they care about their payoff

00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:42.428
this period,
what would the value of the

00:01:42.428 --> 00:01:43.519
stock have to be?
 

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:47.602
Well, under the simple rule for
how people act,

00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:51.417
you'd take 1 half times 104 1
half times 98,

00:01:51.417 --> 00:01:56.209
and that would give you--what
would that give you?

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.924
It'd give you 101,
okay, because this is 4 times 1

00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:04.632
half is 2;
- 2 times 1 half which is - 1,

00:02:04.632 --> 00:02:07.608
so it's 1, so that'd give you
101.

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:10.768
So you would say that the price
of the stock today would have to

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:11.218
be 101.
 

00:02:11.218 --> 00:02:16.281
Now we could slightly refine
this utility function and say

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:21.697
people maximize the discounted
expected payoff next period the

00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:23.740
payoff this period.
 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:31.319
And if the discount is 100 over
101, then we're going to have to

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.660
multiply this by 100 over 101
and we'll get a price of 100.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.530
Okay, so that's the basic first
step.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.022
We can incorporate uncertainty
by assuming people replace the

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:48.400
uncertain outcomes with certain
outcomes in their head,

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.120
and then discount,
just like we've seen before.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.264
Of course, before we had
utility functions but I'm not

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:54.440
going to do that quite yet.
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.663
I'm just going to say,
suppose that we just did that,

00:02:57.663 --> 00:02:58.160
right?
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.865
That would give us a theory of
how people manage uncertainty

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:05.318
and react to uncertainty and how
they set the prices.

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:09.825
So it's the
expected--expectation theory of

00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:10.900
pricing.
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.141
Now before we complicate the
theory, I want to just take this

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:18.889
literally as true and make some
inferences from it.

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:30.264
Well, the first inference you
can make is that today's price

00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:42.410
would then be the discounted
expectation of tomorrow's price.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.455
That's just repeating the same
thing, but what's an implication

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:48.270
of that?
 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:57.127
The implication of that is,
if you didn't know tomorrow's

00:03:57.127 --> 00:04:04.562
price, know the expectation of
tomorrow's price,

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:09.938
you could guess today's price.
 

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:12.378
I'm writing out this trivial
thought because it's such an

00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:13.120
important idea.
 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.269
Once you have a theory of how
prices formed,

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.860
you can always go backwards,
and as the naive,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:24.129
uninformed member of a society,
you can learn,

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:25.829
instead of learning about the
stocks,

00:04:25.829 --> 00:04:27.519
you can learn all you need to
learn,

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.180
perhaps, by looking at the
price.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.024
You may be interested in what
the expected value of the stock

00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:32.829
is next period.
 

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:35.949
To do that in a serious way,
you'd have to study the firm,

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.810
study the product,
study the new inventions,

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.569
the new technologies it was
trying to adopt,

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:43.819
get some idea of the quality of
the manager.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:46.540
You'd have to do a million
things to figure that out.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.083
But if you just look at the
price today, maybe that's going

00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:53.809
to give you a good idea of what
the expected value of the firm

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:54.970
is next period.
 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.206
And that's another way--that
also implies you can test the

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:03.350
theory.
 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.142
Is it true that typically
today's price is a good forecast

00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:10.670
of the price tomorrow,
the expected price tomorrow?

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.519
Obviously you can't just look
at one instance,

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:15.649
because you would just be
looking--if things went up,

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:19.014
you'd be just looking at the
104, and 100 wouldn't be a good

00:05:19.014 --> 00:05:19.870
guess of 104.
 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.369
But if you did this the next
day, and things were

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:23.908
independent,
on the second day,

00:05:23.908 --> 00:05:26.363
of the first day,
you'd have a new price,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:29.160
104 the next day,
and you could see whether the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.639
price went up or down or not.
 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.863
And by doing this 1,000 times
or 100,000 times,

00:05:33.863 --> 00:05:37.786
you'd get a good idea if,
on average, today's price was a

00:05:37.786 --> 00:05:41.009
pretty good predictor of
tomorrow's price.

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:55.350
So here's the--I did that
experiment and here it is.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.060
Why is this so small?
 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.920
Okay, so from 1980--I didn't do
this.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.410
I got someone this morning to
do this at my hedge fund.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.720
So what did he do?
 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.403
He said, suppose you had 1
dollar to put in each day

00:06:11.403 --> 00:06:16.672
starting in 1980,
you could keep track of how

00:06:16.672 --> 00:06:20.216
many dollars--
say you had 100 dollars,

00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:21.649
so it's 100 dollars.
 

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:27.540
You have 100 dollars to invest
each day, starting January

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.120
1^(st), 1980.
 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.490
You put it into the S&amp;P
500,

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.100
so you put it equally into all
stocks,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.221
the 500 biggest stocks,
and you see what the total

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:40.089
price of those 500 stocks is the
next day,

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:42.819
and you subtract the original
price,

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:48.199
and that gives you your percent
return on the first day.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.442
For example,
if it was 101,

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.928
it seems like it went up a
little bit, you'd have a 1

00:06:51.928 --> 00:06:54.560
percent--you'd have made 1
dollar in the first day.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.550
Then I told the guy,
or he decided himself,

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:01.303
put 100 dollars in the second
day, in the S&amp;P 500 and see

00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:03.620
what happened to that the next
day.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.579
Maybe it went up 3 dollars the
second day.

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:09.199
So your total after 2 days
would be 4 dollars.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:11.086
Not your total return,
although that's how he's

00:07:11.086 --> 00:07:11.620
written it.
 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:14.800
It's just the first day,
the stock when up by 1 dollar,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.040
the 100 dollars went up by 1
dollar.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.829
The second day it went up by 3
dollars, so altogether,

00:07:19.829 --> 00:07:21.199
it went up by 4 dollars.
 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:25.327
So the hypothesis is that
today's price is a good forecast

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:26.920
of tomorrow's price.
 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.083
So if you're averaging the 's
and -'s over many days,

00:07:30.083 --> 00:07:33.672
so there are 250 days for 30
years here, that' a lot of days

00:07:33.672 --> 00:07:34.949
you're averaging.
 

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:41.949
And this is the cumulative
total of what would have

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:45.310
happened to you,
okay?

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:50.158
Well, that 100 dollars,
if you did that experiment

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:53.920
7,000 times, you know,
30 times 250.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.353
30 times 250 is 7,500 times,
you would have ended up with

00:07:59.353 --> 00:08:02.459
350 or 400 dollars by the end.
 

00:08:02.459 --> 00:08:06.617
So does that contradict or
confirm the hypothesis that

00:08:06.617 --> 00:08:10.069
we've just made,
that today's price is a good

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:14.149
forecast of the expectation of
tomorrow's price?

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.509
What would you say?
 

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:26.470
Student:
&gt;

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.899
Prof: Okay,
well, so that's a subtle

00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:29.420
answer.
 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.017
So there are two things that I
expected you to say,

00:08:32.017 --> 00:08:34.769
that one being the second and a
very important one.

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:40.181
It looks like 100 dollars
became 400 dollars,

00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:47.558
but that was over 30 years,
so what was the gain per year?

00:08:47.558 --> 00:08:52.076
7,500 days, and you got a
return of 250 percent,

00:08:52.076 --> 00:08:56.880
so you have to divide 250 by
7,500 and you get some

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.379
incredibly low number.
 

00:08:59.379 --> 00:09:06.778
I forgot what it was,
but it was something like .0047

00:09:06.778 --> 00:09:11.190
percent, something like that.
 

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.730
So you're making--so this is
percent.

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:21.289
I've already divided by 100 to
turn it into percentages.

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:23.759
So you make a tiny return.
 

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:27.614
On 100 dollars,
you might go up on average the

00:09:27.614 --> 00:09:30.870
next day to 100 and 1 half
dollars,

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.990
but that's making it--but this
.0047 percent,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.570
so 1 dollar would be 1 percent,
there would be a 1 here,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.720
but we've got a lot of decimal
places there.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.820
So you're dividing 250 by 7,500.
 

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.649
Maybe I've got one decimal too
many there.

00:09:47.649 --> 00:09:49.139
So this is a tiny number.
 

00:09:49.139 --> 00:09:52.596
So in fact today's price is a
pretty good estimate of

00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:53.860
tomorrow's price.
 

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:59.833
You have 100 dollars and maybe
it will turn in on average to

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:02.668
100.0047 dollars tomorrow.
 

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:06.625
So compared to knowing nothing,
if you asked yourself what's

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:09.509
the average value of this stock
tomorrow?

00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:11.759
No one's telling you it's
normalized at 100.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:14.201
It could be 500,
it could be 23,

00:10:14.201 --> 00:10:15.538
it could be 75.
 

00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:17.788
Who knows what the average of
these stocks are?

00:10:17.788 --> 00:10:20.947
The S&amp;P 500 are mixing
stocks that are worth 3 with

00:10:20.947 --> 00:10:24.514
stocks that are worth 500 per
share with stocks that are worth

00:10:24.514 --> 00:10:25.509
75 per share.
 

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:29.798
And it turns out that it's such
an accurate predictor that you

00:10:29.798 --> 00:10:33.384
only are off by a fraction of 1
percent, on average,

00:10:33.384 --> 00:10:34.298
each day.
 

00:10:34.298 --> 00:10:37.471
So compared to knowing nothing,
you have a huge insight into

00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.644
what's going on in the world and
how valuable the stocks are

00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:41.990
going to be tomorrow.
 

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.230
Tomorrow hasn't happened yet.
 

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:44.976
Already by looking at the
prices today,

00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:47.779
you have a tremendous idea of
what the prices are tomorrow.

00:10:47.779 --> 00:10:50.695
So that's the first thing to
notice, the theory's kind of

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:51.320
confirmed.
 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.186
The second thing to notice as
well, it doesn't seem perfectly

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.100
confirmed, because this seems
like a pretty positive thing.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.923
You know, it seems to be going
up most of the time,

00:10:59.923 --> 00:11:02.520
and as he said,
"Well, we haven't done the

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.990
discounting yet."
 

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:06.669
We should have done
discounting, because tomorrow is

00:11:06.669 --> 00:11:09.980
not quite as important to you as
today, so I shouldn't have just

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.399
been looking at return.
 

00:11:11.399 --> 00:11:15.019
I should have looked at return
per day.

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:22.005
So I should have discounted
each day by whatever the

00:11:22.005 --> 00:11:24.610
interest rate is.
 

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:27.490
Let's say you think it's 4
percent in a year,

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.500
divided by 250,
since there are 250 days in the

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.090
year.
 

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:33.538
So approximately,
I should have gotten 250,

00:11:33.538 --> 00:11:35.580
I should have discounted by
that.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.075
So when you do that,
the number gets even much

00:11:39.075 --> 00:11:41.745
closer to 0,
but it doesn't come exactly

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:45.260
equal to 0 and so we're going to
see that we need something else

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.879
to make up the difference.
 

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:50.440
But it's such a tiny difference
that needs explaining.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.658
So to summarize,
we have this view that

00:11:52.658 --> 00:11:56.160
uncertainty is going to change
everything that we think about

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.840
the world and it will change a
lot of things dramatically,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.399
but it's not going to change
the idea that today,

00:12:03.399 --> 00:12:06.722
the price today of things is a
pretty good indicator of what

00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:08.918
their value is going to be
tomorrow,

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:11.649
if you replace value tomorrow,
which is uncertain,

00:12:11.649 --> 00:12:14.210
by the expected value tomorrow.
 

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.743
So you can still learn a
tremendous amount about the

00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:18.678
world, just by looking at the
market.

00:12:18.678 --> 00:12:24.250
That's a very important lesson,
so let's go a little further

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.100
though.
 

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:30.952
Suppose that you thought,
well, maybe people--maybe I

00:12:30.952 --> 00:12:35.678
want to ask a more complicated
question.

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:40.504
I want to say,
suppose I only look at stocks

00:12:40.504 --> 00:12:43.308
that went up yesterday.
 

00:12:43.308 --> 00:12:46.428
I only look at stocks that went
up yesterday.

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:49.721
Now maybe there's something
about the market that,

00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:53.216
you know, momentum will keep
carrying those stocks up

00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:54.090
tomorrow.
 

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.979
So once the market gets
rolling, maybe the market's not

00:12:56.979 --> 00:12:58.210
such a good forecast.
 

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.337
Maybe, as Shiller says,
there are all these

00:13:00.337 --> 00:13:03.410
psychological forces at work,
and once things get rolling and

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:07.562
prices have gone up yesterday,
the price will keep going up

00:13:07.562 --> 00:13:08.509
tomorrow.
 

00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:10.937
So today's price won't be such
a good indicator of tomorrow's

00:13:10.937 --> 00:13:13.570
price, because tomorrow's price
is probably going to be higher.

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.620
So I'm going to repeat now
exactly the same experiment,

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.990
except instead of putting 100
dollars in all the S&amp;P 500,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.607
I'll only put the 100 dollars
into the stocks that went up

00:13:25.607 --> 00:13:26.370
yesterday.
 

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:30.028
Or I might even refine it by
selling short the stocks that

00:13:30.028 --> 00:13:31.440
went down yesterday.
 

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.950
Okay, so what does that do?
 

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:43.558
Does that change the numbers?
 

00:13:43.558 --> 00:13:46.740
So if I blow this up,
maybe it is blown up.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.259
Can't do any better than that.
 

00:13:48.259 --> 00:13:50.120
Does that change the numbers?
 

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.840
Well, no.
 

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.000
In fact, it makes it worse.
 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.428
It's closer to 0 now.
 

00:13:55.428 --> 00:13:58.335
So again, over all this time,
it kind of went up to the same

00:13:58.335 --> 00:14:00.695
peak,
but fell down even further,

00:14:00.695 --> 00:14:03.582
so this thing--
so again, the stock prices

00:14:03.582 --> 00:14:07.230
today, even if I try to refine
it and get more clever.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.700
I try to fool the market.
 

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.774
I say, okay,
the market does a good job on

00:14:10.774 --> 00:14:11.278
average.
 

00:14:11.278 --> 00:14:14.245
Today's price is pretty good on
average of predicting tomorrow's

00:14:14.245 --> 00:14:14.668
prices.
 

00:14:14.668 --> 00:14:17.380
What about today's prices of
those stocks that went up

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.528
yesterday, you know,
the momentum thing?

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:23.274
Maybe that's not such a
good--maybe on that subset the

00:14:23.274 --> 00:14:24.899
market's not so good.
 

00:14:24.899 --> 00:14:28.240
Well, the market is pretty good
on those too.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.110
So again, you have to do the
discounting and you have to

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:35.840
realize that there are a huge
number of days here,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.259
so this tiny return is really
nothing,

00:14:38.259 --> 00:14:40.610
averaged over all those numbers
of days.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.879
Well, let's see if we can come
up with another strategy.

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:48.279
I forgot what other strategy I
tried out here.

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:53.282
Oh, suppose you could say,
"I want to choose only

00:14:53.282 --> 00:14:58.755
those stocks that went up 20
days ago, or 25 days ago or 14

00:14:58.755 --> 00:15:00.548
days ago."
 

00:15:00.548 --> 00:15:03.413
This number here,
these bars here,

00:15:03.413 --> 00:15:07.580
represent for everything for
the S&amp;P 500,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:08.990
you try to say,
"What's the

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:09.899
correlation?"
 

00:15:09.899 --> 00:15:12.567
That's like the covariance but
normalized so it's between 0 and

00:15:12.567 --> 00:15:12.740
1.
 

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:18.269
What's the correlation of a
move yesterday and a move today?

00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:21.792
Does the fact that a stock went
up yesterday mean that it's

00:15:21.792 --> 00:15:23.190
going to go up today?
 

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:27.255
Or does the fact that a stock
went up three days ago mean that

00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:30.990
it's going to go up today,
between today and tomorrow?

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.937
So if it went up two days
ago--if it went up yesterday,

00:15:33.937 --> 00:15:36.721
from yesterday to today,
does that suggest that it's

00:15:36.721 --> 00:15:39.070
likely to go up from today to
tomorrow?

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.494
So what this says--of course,
if you only did the experiment

00:15:42.494 --> 00:15:45.279
once, you'd always find that it
did something.

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.320
Okay, so you have to do many
experiments,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.139
and then figure out,
it's a statistical thing,

00:15:50.139 --> 00:15:51.960
to sort of guess what the
correlation is,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.399
estimate the correlation.
 

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:57.500
Then you have to see whether
it's significant.

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:00.923
So anything in this blue band
means the numbers are

00:16:00.923 --> 00:16:02.019
insignificant.
 

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:05.470
So these bars represent what
the correlation is.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:10.070
So no matter how far back you
go, you basically,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:13.602
knowing which way the stock
went 27 days ago tells you

00:16:13.602 --> 00:16:17.870
almost nothing about which way
the stock is going to go today.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.129
There's almost no correlation.
 

00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:22.754
If it went up 27 days ago,
it's statistically,

00:16:22.754 --> 00:16:26.942
over the last 7,500 days,
slightly more than half the

00:16:26.942 --> 00:16:29.600
time, it went up again today.
 

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.837
But such a small fraction of
the time did it go up again,

00:16:33.837 --> 00:16:37.697
the more times up than down,
that it's statistically

00:16:37.697 --> 00:16:39.058
insignificant.
 

00:16:39.058 --> 00:16:42.687
If you only do it five times,
it's going to have to be one

00:16:42.687 --> 00:16:45.018
way or the other,
so if you do it an odd number

00:16:45.018 --> 00:16:46.970
of times,
it can't be exactly even so you

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.668
just figure out what the
statistical significance is.

00:16:49.668 --> 00:16:52.501
So none of them hardly,
almost none of them,

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:54.610
are statistically significant.
 

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.106
So once again,
it's not only the case that

00:16:57.106 --> 00:17:00.639
today's prices are good
forecasts of tomorrow's prices,

00:17:00.639 --> 00:17:02.772
but today's prices,
even if you add some

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.932
information to it,
seem to be--even if you try to

00:17:05.932 --> 00:17:10.094
refine your set and look at only
buying stocks that 27 days ago

00:17:10.094 --> 00:17:12.752
went up,
the prices of those stocks are

00:17:12.752 --> 00:17:16.521
still going to be a reasonably
accurate forecast of tomorrow's

00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:17.140
prices.
 

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.424
So I did one more experiment,
or Rashid did one more

00:17:20.424 --> 00:17:23.259
experiment for me,
in case he hears this in a

00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:23.838
year.
 

00:17:23.838 --> 00:17:31.769
He did the same thing on a
portfolio of stocks.

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:35.328
So he looked at a 12 month
rolling average.

00:17:35.328 --> 00:17:38.144
He looked at the stocks that
had done particularly well in

00:17:38.144 --> 00:17:40.220
the past 12 months and he bought
those,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.028
and then he looked at the
stocks that had done

00:17:42.028 --> 00:17:44.640
particularly badly in the last
12 months and he shorted those,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.068
and here's what his returns
would have been,

00:17:47.068 --> 00:17:50.779
just taking the daily thing and
just adding it.

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:53.163
And you see,
you get almost exactly back to

00:17:53.163 --> 00:17:53.390
0.
 

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.029
So this was the original
compelling evidence,

00:17:57.029 --> 00:18:03.318
things like this in the 1970s
and 1980s,

00:18:03.318 --> 00:18:08.856
led people--economists--to say
that the prices of very many

00:18:08.856 --> 00:18:14.490
things seem to be very accurate
guides to future prices,

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:22.460
and they called it rational
expectations.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.395
So the high water mark of this
theory was in 1983,

00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:32.532
I think, the most amusing
example, was Richard Roll,

00:18:32.532 --> 00:18:36.160
who taught at UCLA,
and oranges.

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.190
So Richard Roll did the
following experiment.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:42.400
He said, it turns out that for
concentrated orange juice,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.472
97 percent of the oranges that
are used for concentrated orange

00:18:46.472 --> 00:18:50.348
juice are grown on trees that
are very close to Orlando,

00:18:50.348 --> 00:18:55.930
Florida, where the weather is
pretty much the same.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.607
I mean, it's a small area,
so whatever the weather is,

00:18:58.607 --> 00:19:00.630
it's that weather over the
whole area.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:03.453
It's amazing that so many of
the oranges are grown in the

00:19:03.453 --> 00:19:04.108
same place.
 

00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:06.420
I'm talking about concentrated
orange juice.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.190
California's no competition for
Florida.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.034
In fact, no competition for
Orlando, Florida when it comes

00:19:12.034 --> 00:19:14.778
to concentrated orange juice,
not oranges in general.

00:19:14.778 --> 00:19:19.605
So he said to himself,
"How good is the market at

00:19:19.605 --> 00:19:23.250
predicting the price of orange
juice,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.500
at predicting next period's
price of orange juice?"

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.193
And he found,
just like we did here,

00:19:28.193 --> 00:19:29.578
it's quite good.
 

00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:32.146
But then he said,
"Maybe there's other

00:19:32.146 --> 00:19:35.509
information that the market
doesn't know about."

00:19:35.509 --> 00:19:39.548
So he said, "What about
the weather?"

00:19:39.548 --> 00:19:45.470
So the weather has a tremendous
effect on orange juice prices,

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.484
because if it's--four hours of
freezing temperatures starts to

00:19:49.484 --> 00:19:52.601
kill the trees,
then you get less supply of

00:19:52.601 --> 00:19:55.750
oranges for the concentrated
orange juice,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.509
and then the price goes up.
 

00:19:57.509 --> 00:20:04.500
So he said, since 1970 or so,
the US Weather Bureau has spent

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:11.842
250 million dollars building all
these weather forecasting units

00:20:11.842 --> 00:20:15.795
that make daily--
in fact, they make 36 hour,

00:20:15.795 --> 00:20:19.086
24 hour and 12 hour forecasts
of what the weather's going to

00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:20.089
be next period.
 

00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:23.660
So he said, "Really,
if the market is so good and

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.960
the market price today is really
telling an uninformed investor

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.088
what the price ought to be
tomorrow,

00:20:29.088 --> 00:20:32.028
let me see now,
by getting a record of the

00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.137
weather reports,
could I improve on the market

00:20:35.137 --> 00:20:35.558
price?
 

00:20:35.558 --> 00:20:38.223
By putting together today's
market price and the weather

00:20:38.223 --> 00:20:41.186
report today,
the weather prediction today,

00:20:41.186 --> 00:20:44.882
could I make a better forecast
of the market price

00:20:44.882 --> 00:20:46.240
tomorrow?"
 

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.460
And he found out, no.
 

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:59.522
Statistically,
the weather prices does not

00:20:59.522 --> 00:21:06.269
improve price forecast.
 

00:21:06.269 --> 00:21:07.910
So how could you interpret that?
 

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.853
How could that possibly be that
knowing the weather reports

00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:15.796
doesn't help you predict the
price better the next day than

00:21:15.796 --> 00:21:17.019
today's price?
 

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:19.930
How could that be?
 

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.369
What's the obvious reason for
that?

00:21:23.369 --> 00:21:24.180
Yeah?
 

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.509
Student:
&gt;

00:21:27.509 --> 00:21:28.630
Prof: Right,
so the people buying and

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:30.318
selling, they're also looking at
the weather report,

00:21:30.318 --> 00:21:32.471
and so naturally,
they've taken that into

00:21:32.471 --> 00:21:33.009
account.
 

00:21:33.009 --> 00:21:36.092
So what it illustrates though
is that all this kind of

00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:39.522
information that you might think
would go into affecting the

00:21:39.522 --> 00:21:41.848
value of the orange juice
tomorrow,

00:21:41.848 --> 00:21:44.012
the market is already
processing that because the

00:21:44.012 --> 00:21:46.308
people buying and selling,
they're already looking at the

00:21:46.308 --> 00:21:49.288
weather report,
and they're figuring out what

00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:51.538
the right price should be.
 

00:21:51.538 --> 00:21:55.630
So that was a pretty stunning
conclusion, but he didn't want

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:56.740
to stop there.
 

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:59.650
So what did he do next?
 

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:01.946
What if you were--you know how
in comp.

00:22:01.946 --> 00:22:02.308
lit.
 

00:22:02.308 --> 00:22:05.084
they always says things
backwards, the reader is

00:22:05.084 --> 00:22:08.270
detective or the detective is
reader, you know--anyway,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:09.275
when I took comp.
 

00:22:09.275 --> 00:22:11.576
lit., that was the gist of
every course,

00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:13.818
was to do everything backwards.
 

00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:15.891
That's how you knew you were
clever in comp.

00:22:15.891 --> 00:22:16.180
lit.
 

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.382
What would a comp.
 

00:22:17.382 --> 00:22:17.650
lit.
 

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:18.920
person have done?
 

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.660
Yes?
 

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:21.280
Student:
Used the price to predict the

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:21.650
weather.
 

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.436
Prof: He said,
"Let's use the price to

00:22:24.436 --> 00:22:26.028
predict the weather."
 

00:22:26.028 --> 00:22:31.583
So he'd said,
suppose the price today turned

00:22:31.583 --> 00:22:38.816
out to be higher than the
price--okay, so--the price from

00:22:38.816 --> 00:22:44.500
yesterday to today went
unexpectedly up.

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:46.640
It went unexpectedly up.
 

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.145
Then he said,
"Okay, that means these

00:22:49.145 --> 00:22:53.058
market guys were surprised today
to see the price go up."

00:22:53.058 --> 00:22:55.990
There's a weather forecast back
here as well,

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:57.980
and there's a weather forecast
here,

00:22:57.980 --> 00:23:02.954
and he said,
maybe you can now say if the

00:23:02.954 --> 00:23:06.300
price went up--
can you use that to now

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.480
forecast the weather?
 

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:11.000
So he said, suppose that
whatever the forecast is here,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.990
you now say since the price
went up,

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.358
we're now going to forecast
that the weather guys--

00:23:16.358 --> 00:23:18.961
the price going up means
they've learned something here

00:23:18.961 --> 00:23:20.838
about the weather probably being
bad.

00:23:20.838 --> 00:23:22.961
So the question is,
did the weatherman learn the

00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:23.548
same thing?
 

00:23:23.548 --> 00:23:26.672
So he says, "Let's test
the hypothesis that when the

00:23:26.672 --> 00:23:29.298
price went up,
these guys learned more about

00:23:29.298 --> 00:23:31.960
the weather than the weather
predictors did,

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.796
so that in fact the actual
weather from this prediction is

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:36.089
likely to go down."
 

00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:40.358
And that's just what he found.
 

00:23:40.358 --> 00:23:44.098
You can't use weather to
improve the price prediction of

00:23:44.098 --> 00:23:47.634
prices, but you can use prices
to improve the weather

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:50.150
prediction of the weather
people.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:55.153
That was one of those stunning
confirmations of the rational

00:23:55.153 --> 00:23:59.478
expectations hypothesis,
so what could explain that,

00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:00.750
by the way?
 

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.829
Is that just crazy or an
accident, or is there some

00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:08.980
logical explanation for that?
 

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:09.690
Yeah?
 

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:11.848
Student:
People buying and selling

00:24:11.848 --> 00:24:13.683
oranges know more about the
weather

00:24:13.683 --> 00:24:15.250
&gt;
 

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:16.278
Prof: Than the
government does.

00:24:16.278 --> 00:24:18.884
So the people buying and
selling oranges,

00:24:18.884 --> 00:24:22.400
this is billions of dollars of
money changing hands.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.526
The government spent 250
million dollars in this area

00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:27.088
forecasting the weather.
 

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:28.588
These guys have billions at
stake.

00:24:28.588 --> 00:24:32.409
They in fact have better
weather forecasting technology

00:24:32.409 --> 00:24:35.403
than the government does,
and they're making better

00:24:35.403 --> 00:24:37.390
forecasts than the government is
of the weather.

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.473
So if you ask them,
they would know better than the

00:24:39.473 --> 00:24:41.724
government what the weather's
going to be the next day,

00:24:41.724 --> 00:24:43.058
and the price reflects that.
 

00:24:43.058 --> 00:24:47.220
Okay, so that's the efficient
markets hypothesis,

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.470
which seduced many in the
economics profession,

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:53.210
and there's still a tremendous
amount of truth to it,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.346
at least at the level--if you
don't know anything and you want

00:24:56.346 --> 00:24:58.299
to know something about the
future,

00:24:58.299 --> 00:24:59.558
look at the prices today.
 

00:24:59.558 --> 00:25:02.286
That's going to tell you a
tremendous amount about the

00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:02.750
future.
 

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.028
Now the question is whether
it's as precise as Roll seems to

00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:11.380
suggest, and we're going to see
that it's not going to be.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.048
But anyway, for a while,
these people,

00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:18.067
the rational expectations
school, which is mostly in

00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:19.948
Chicago,
they had the view,

00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:22.269
and Fama was one of the
leaders,

00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:25.701
they had the view that this
rational expectations pricing

00:25:25.701 --> 00:25:29.500
was the best-documented truth in
all of the social sciences.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.990
That was what Fama said.
 

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.769
So we'll have to come back to
see that that's not always the

00:25:34.769 --> 00:25:37.910
case, but certainly looks good
in these graphs.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.250
Okay, that's the first idea.
 

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.914
Now the next idea that we
looked at was,

00:25:45.914 --> 00:25:50.710
what is the most important
thing to be uncertain?

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:54.674
Well, there's output that
you're uncertain about,

00:25:54.674 --> 00:25:58.721
but the next most important
thing is the discount,

00:25:58.721 --> 00:26:00.538
the interest rate.
 

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:03.002
After all, that's the most
important variable in the whole

00:26:03.002 --> 00:26:04.298
economy according to Fisher.
 

00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:12.710
Who's to say the discount is
always exactly the same thing,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:16.480
so, uncertain discounts.
 

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.430
So now we said--and you've done
in the problem set--

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.769
if the interest rate is 100
percent,

00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:23.858
it might go up to 200 percent,
say,

00:26:23.858 --> 00:26:30.263
or it might go down to 50
percent, and now you want to

00:26:30.263 --> 00:26:32.699
ask,
what's the value of 1 dollar

00:26:32.699 --> 00:26:33.038
here?
 

00:26:33.038 --> 00:26:35.833
It's a little subtler,
because here,

00:26:35.833 --> 00:26:40.622
the expectation was all that
mattered, the expectation of the

00:26:40.622 --> 00:26:41.578
payoffs.
 

00:26:41.578 --> 00:26:45.202
If I change this to 106,
and I change this to 96,

00:26:45.202 --> 00:26:48.901
I haven't changed the
expectation, so the price is

00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:50.940
going to stay the same.
 

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.740
So the variance has nothing to
do with what the price is.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.920
But things can get subtler.
 

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.670
Let's suppose that what's
changing is the discount rate.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.808
Now the variance is going to
have a big effect on what the

00:27:03.808 --> 00:27:05.480
values of things are.
 

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.221
So if we think this is
happening with 50:50

00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:11.880
probability, the guy--so what do
I mean by this model?

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.384
Today you know that the value
of something tomorrow is going

00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:17.818
to be 1 half of what it pays
tomorrow,

00:27:17.818 --> 00:27:20.309
up 1 half what it pays tomorrow
down,

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:22.528
discounted by 100 percent.
 

00:27:22.528 --> 00:27:25.107
Tomorrow, you're not sure
whether you're going to be

00:27:25.107 --> 00:27:28.038
discounting it 200 percent or
discounting it 50 percent.

00:27:28.038 --> 00:27:33.551
So then the value today is
going to be 1 over (1 100

00:27:33.551 --> 00:27:40.232
percent),
times (1 half times 1 over (1

00:27:40.232 --> 00:27:51.930
200 percent) of 1 1 half times 1
over (1 50 percent) times 1).

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:54.142
Because over here,
you know that this dollar's

00:27:54.142 --> 00:27:56.108
only going to be worth 1 third
to you.

00:27:56.108 --> 00:27:58.496
Over here, you know this
dollar's going to be worth 2

00:27:58.496 --> 00:27:58.910
thirds.
 

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.450
So that's the 2 thirds here and
the 1 third here,

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.048
and there's a 50:50 chance of
each of these,

00:28:05.048 --> 00:28:08.180
and you're going to discount it
by 1 over 100 percent,

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.720
so that's what the value is to
you today.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.255
So now you did a problem set
where you had to do a bunch of

00:28:15.255 --> 00:28:16.170
these things.
 

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.402
We're going to call that D(2),
because that's what you would

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:24.848
pay today to get 1 dollar for
sure at time 2 in the future,

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:31.960
and D(1) is going to be just 1
over (1 100 percent),

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.680
which is 1 half,
which is what you would pay

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.400
today to get 1 dollar for sure
at time 1.

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:41.984
And I could compute D(3),
and any other D that I wanted

00:28:41.984 --> 00:28:42.410
to.
 

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.634
Okay, so we're going to see
that interest rate uncertainty

00:28:45.634 --> 00:28:48.519
is the most important
uncertainty in the economy.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:50.548
The value of everything is
going to change.

00:28:50.548 --> 00:28:53.523
If the interest rates go up,
all the bonds are going to go

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:54.358
down in value.
 

00:28:54.358 --> 00:28:56.775
All the mortgages are going to
change in value,

00:28:56.775 --> 00:28:59.608
although sometimes they go in
surprising directions.

00:28:59.608 --> 00:29:02.031
But everything's going to
change in value when the

00:29:02.031 --> 00:29:03.118
interest rate moves.
 

00:29:03.118 --> 00:29:05.615
That's going to subject
everybody to tremendous amounts

00:29:05.615 --> 00:29:08.386
of risk and we have to figure
out, how are they going to cope

00:29:08.386 --> 00:29:09.450
with all that risk?
 

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:12.438
Before we answer that question,
we want to answer the simpler

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.778
question, how are they going to
value things?

00:29:14.778 --> 00:29:18.078
And here we just have the same
tree that we had before.

00:29:18.078 --> 00:29:20.999
So that's what we did last
class, and I just wanted to

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:23.753
finish that thought,
which I didn't get a chance to

00:29:23.753 --> 00:29:24.140
do.
 

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.924
So for period 3,
we could have done a 3 period

00:29:28.924 --> 00:29:35.730
thing and assumed that this went
up to 400 percent and would have

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:40.730
gone to 100 percent or down to
25 percent,

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:44.640
and then still paid 1,1, 1.
 

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.020
Okay, so that's payoff for 1
dollar for sure,

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.998
but now we've got still more
uncertainty in the interest

00:29:49.998 --> 00:29:50.538
rates.
 

00:29:50.538 --> 00:29:54.220
So you figured out in the
problem set what the value of

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.808
that's going to be and you got
D(3).

00:29:56.808 --> 00:30:00.833
So I could have done this for
D(4) and any other T that I

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:04.778
wanted to and in fact,
that's also what you did in the

00:30:04.778 --> 00:30:08.940
problem set,
you did it for all the way up

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.038
to D(30).
 

00:30:10.038 --> 00:30:14.910
Okay, so I want now to just say
one thing about the environment,

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:17.374
before--we're going to come
back and analyze this over and

00:30:17.374 --> 00:30:19.969
over again to see the risk the
whole economy's exposed to and

00:30:19.969 --> 00:30:22.778
how people cope with that risk
with interest rates changing,

00:30:22.778 --> 00:30:25.328
but I want to make one
observation.

00:30:25.328 --> 00:30:28.123
These numbers,
D(1), D(2), D(3),

00:30:28.123 --> 00:30:33.440
D(4), they reflect people's
attitudes towards the future.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.750
What would you pay today to get
1 dollar at time 1?

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.680
What would pay today to get 1
dollar at time 2?

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.410
What would you pay today to get
1 dollar at time 3?

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.769
So what is the shape of that
function?

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:47.115
Well, in the case of certainty,
with a constant discount rate,

00:30:47.115 --> 00:30:50.818
that function would have to
decline exponentially.

00:30:50.818 --> 00:31:00.289
So it would be an exponential
decline.

00:31:00.289 --> 00:31:00.808
Why?
 

00:31:00.808 --> 00:31:05.068
Because this would be equal to
1 over (1 r),

00:31:05.068 --> 00:31:08.838
and this would be equal to 1
over (1 r) squared,

00:31:08.838 --> 00:31:12.692
and this would be equal to 1
over (1 r) to the fourth,

00:31:12.692 --> 00:31:13.130
etc.
 

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.308
So after 100 years or 500
years, you wouldn't care,

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:20.653
as long as r is .03 or
something percent,

00:31:20.653 --> 00:31:22.660
.03, r is 3 percent.
 

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.570
As long as it's a number like 2
percent or 3 percent,

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:27.922
after 500 years,
you just don't care at all

00:31:27.922 --> 00:31:29.769
about what's going to happen.
 

00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:31.299
If the whole economy,
the society,

00:31:31.299 --> 00:31:33.805
is discounting the future and
trading it off like this,

00:31:33.805 --> 00:31:35.798
you don't care at all about the
future.

00:31:35.798 --> 00:31:39.916
So environmental improvements
today, which don't have an

00:31:39.916 --> 00:31:43.510
effect for 200 years,
would be regarded as stupid

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.259
ideas.
 

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:47.669
And environmentalists have been
trying desperately to make an

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:50.509
argument that 200 years from now
really matters.

00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:52.400
So of course,
they argue about the interest

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.920
rate,
but really, all they're doing

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.680
is they're arguing that the
interest rate,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:58.375
instead of being 3 percent
should be 1 percent or something

00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:01.548
like that,
and that's not really helping,

00:32:01.548 --> 00:32:05.284
because even 1 percent,
if you keep doing that for 500

00:32:05.284 --> 00:32:06.967
years,
you're going to get a pretty

00:32:06.967 --> 00:32:08.180
trivial number by the end.
 

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:13.269
So let me ask you the following
question.

00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:17.777
Suppose you could have 15
dollars today,

00:32:17.777 --> 00:32:24.711
or--so this is an experiment
Thaler ran, who was a behavioral

00:32:24.711 --> 00:32:26.328
economist.
 

00:32:26.328 --> 00:32:35.298
So, next month,
1 year and 10 years.

00:32:35.298 --> 00:32:39.406
How much money would you want
next month instead of the 15

00:32:39.406 --> 00:32:40.558
dollars today?
 

00:32:40.558 --> 00:32:42.819
Somebody give a number,
shout out a number.

00:32:42.819 --> 00:32:45.390
What seems equivalent to you?
 

00:32:45.390 --> 00:32:46.298
20.
 

00:32:46.298 --> 00:32:50.438
It happens to be exactly what
the average--do you know the

00:32:50.438 --> 00:32:51.890
Thaler experiment?
 

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.640
That's precisely the average.
 

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.907
Thaler did a class like this,
averaged all the numbers,

00:32:56.907 --> 00:32:58.298
he got 20, amazingly.
 

00:32:58.298 --> 00:33:02.089
What about for 1 year,
what would you say?

00:33:02.089 --> 00:33:08.890
50 to 100.
 

00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:11.130
And what about 10 years?
 

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.130
200.
 

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.240
Okay, so I'll tell you the
Thaler numbers.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.059
I stupidly forgot them all.
 

00:33:18.059 --> 00:33:23.440
What a turkey.
 

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.558
Okay, so the numbers of
Thaler--let's just go with those

00:33:30.558 --> 00:33:37.420
numbers, but what do you think
about those numbers?

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:43.717
So Thaler got--it's
amazing--Thaler got 20,50 and

00:33:43.717 --> 00:33:50.801
100 were Thaler's numbers,
so very close to what you're

00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:52.769
telling me.
 

00:33:52.769 --> 00:33:54.180
50 and 100.
 

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.609
So what's the matter with those
numbers.

00:33:57.609 --> 00:33:58.848
Let's go with Thaler's.
 

00:33:58.848 --> 00:34:01.288
They weren't that different
from yours.

00:34:01.288 --> 00:34:12.280
What's the problem with
Thaler's numbers?

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.989
Student:
&gt;

00:34:15.989 --> 00:34:17.659
Prof: Rapidly, rapidly.
 

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:18.960
This is just one month.
 

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.505
You have to have a huge
discount to care--this

00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:24.900
is--you're discounting by 33
percent or something a month.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.199
It's a tremendous discount to
go from here to here.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:31.679
If you did that 12 times--so if
you look at the monthly discount

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.880
rate from here to here,
you get 33 percent.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.188
From here to here,
it's to the 12^(th) power,

00:34:37.188 --> 00:34:39.130
so you're discounting by 5
percent.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:42.797
From here to here,
you've got the 120^(th) power,

00:34:42.797 --> 00:34:47.001
so what number to the 120^(th)
gives you 6 and 2 thirds,

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:48.989
not a very big number.
 

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:55.875
In fact, the reciprocal of that
number is the discount,

00:34:55.875 --> 00:34:58.170
is .75 to the 1.
 

00:34:58.170 --> 00:35:07.699
So this is .75 obviously,
and then (15 over 50) to the 1

00:35:07.699 --> 00:35:17.231
tenth--1 twelfth--is .9,
and then (15 over 100) to the 1

00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:20.869
twentieth is .98.
 

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:24.342
So you're discounting by 33
percent, something like that,

00:35:24.342 --> 00:35:26.699
by 10 percent and then by 2
percent.

00:35:26.699 --> 00:35:30.969
So your discount rate is
falling rapidly.

00:35:30.969 --> 00:35:34.518
You do experiments with
animals, you get the same

00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:35.480
conclusion.
 

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.547
You ask the animals--you can
make an animal work and then

00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:43.469
they'll have to wait a certain
time to get the food.

00:35:43.469 --> 00:35:46.992
Or if they work harder,
they can get more food,

00:35:46.992 --> 00:35:50.670
but they have to wait a longer
amount of time.

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:52.030
So you try and do the
experiment.

00:35:52.030 --> 00:35:54.380
I'm not sure these actually are
believable,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:57.307
but anyway, they do these
experiments and they figure out

00:35:57.307 --> 00:35:59.956
how much the animal is --
you know, these are birds and

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:04.190
mice and all kinds of things--
trading off waiting for getting

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.641
a bigger reward,
and they get the similar kinds

00:36:07.641 --> 00:36:10.929
of numbers to what Thaler got by
talking to psychological

00:36:10.929 --> 00:36:12.809
experiments with real people.
 

00:36:12.809 --> 00:36:14.489
How can you explain it?
 

00:36:14.489 --> 00:36:17.347
In the world of constant
discounting, you couldn't

00:36:17.347 --> 00:36:18.630
possibly explain it.
 

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.115
Now of course,
you could explain it by saying,

00:36:22.115 --> 00:36:26.610
"Everybody's discount rate
is going to get smaller and

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.780
smaller over time."
 

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.483
Their annual discount rate is
getting smaller and smaller over

00:36:32.483 --> 00:36:32.909
time.
 

00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:35.012
But that's totally
unbelievable,

00:36:35.012 --> 00:36:35.760
you know.
 

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.722
It's just, you know that 1 year
from now, if you were asked the

00:36:39.722 --> 00:36:42.981
same kinds of questions,
you'd give the same kind of

00:36:42.981 --> 00:36:43.750
answers.
 

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:47.784
So your discount between today
and next month is going to be

00:36:47.784 --> 00:36:50.110
the same next year as it is now.
 

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.454
So it's not the case that the 1
month discount happens to be

00:36:53.454 --> 00:36:55.610
high now because you're in
college,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.260
and then the day you get out of
college,

00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.186
you're going to be more mature
and so you're going to have a

00:36:59.186 --> 00:36:59.969
smaller discount rate.
 

00:36:59.969 --> 00:37:01.670
When you get to my age,
you're going to be even more

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.070
mature and have a smaller
discount rate.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:04.219
That doesn't happen.
 

00:37:04.219 --> 00:37:06.199
The discount rate doesn't go
down like that.

00:37:06.199 --> 00:37:07.766
In fact, if anything,
if you're rational,

00:37:07.766 --> 00:37:08.550
it ought to go up.
 

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:10.119
I'm closer to death than you
are.

00:37:10.119 --> 00:37:12.427
If I don't get the stuff now,
who knows when I'll ever get

00:37:12.427 --> 00:37:12.630
it?
 

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:15.135
So the discount rate should be
going up, not going down,

00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:17.778
and yet it seems like there's
so much evidence that it goes

00:37:17.778 --> 00:37:18.190
down.
 

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:21.969
So this is a big puzzle in
economics.

00:37:21.969 --> 00:37:24.797
So I just offer,
again, I'm going to make a

00:37:24.797 --> 00:37:26.750
habit of offering theories.
 

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.210
I'm not saying this is the
right theory.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.626
I'm just simply pointing out
that if you had this random

00:37:31.626 --> 00:37:34.297
discount, put uncertainty into
the discount,

00:37:34.297 --> 00:37:37.030
put uncertainty into the
interest rates.

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:40.420
Uncertainty in the interest
rates is the heart of finance.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.405
Every single person,
every single serious finance

00:37:44.405 --> 00:37:48.724
person, thinks about--what do
you call it?--uncertain

00:37:48.724 --> 00:37:51.550
variability in interest rates.
 

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:54.840
So I take the simplest possible
process, where the interest

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.619
rates can go up or down by the
same percentage.

00:37:57.619 --> 00:38:01.980
So for example,
you could start at 4 percent,

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:08.706
and then the variation or the
standard deviation could be 16

00:38:08.706 --> 00:38:12.204
percent,
which means that 4 percent

00:38:12.204 --> 00:38:16.778
basically goes to 4 percent
times 1.16 or to 4 percent

00:38:16.778 --> 00:38:18.420
divided by 1.16.
 

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:24.114
That process actually,
times e to the .16 or times e

00:38:24.114 --> 00:38:27.840
to the -.16,
which is very close to times

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:32.530
1.16, that geometric random walk
is the basic model of finance.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.423
And what you found in your
homework is, you were supposed

00:38:35.423 --> 00:38:37.853
to find, that as you go out
further and further,

00:38:37.853 --> 00:38:40.179
the effective discount rate
does go down.

00:38:40.179 --> 00:38:42.349
And what I forgot to say,
the punch line,

00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:46.980
Thaler's numbers here confirm
what all the behavioral

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:51.351
economists suggest,
which is that there's

00:38:51.351 --> 00:38:54.110
hyperbolic discounting.
 

00:38:54.110 --> 00:39:00.085
So what they confirmed in these
experiments is that if this is

00:39:00.085 --> 00:39:03.625
D(t),
this should go down like t to

00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:08.068
some power,
you know, t to the - some

00:39:08.068 --> 00:39:13.329
power, t to the -2 or t to the
-1 half,

00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:14.610
or something like that.
 

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:21.472
They don't pin down what this
number is, but t to the -a,

00:39:21.472 --> 00:39:26.987
so it goes down much slower
than the exponent,

00:39:26.987 --> 00:39:32.380
which is some exponent like .9
to the t.

00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.119
That goes down much faster than
that does.

00:39:34.119 --> 00:39:35.699
This is a polynomial in t.
 

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:37.250
This is an exponential in t.
 

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.139
So it's going down much faster.
 

00:39:39.139 --> 00:39:42.494
So this is a classic--Thaler's
numbers are a classic

00:39:42.494 --> 00:39:43.349
polynomial.
 

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:45.599
In fact, with exponent 1 half.
 

00:39:45.599 --> 00:39:50.266
Thaler's numbers fit t to the
-1 half, if you do the right

00:39:50.266 --> 00:39:51.659
starting point.
 

00:39:51.659 --> 00:39:54.050
So what did I show?
 

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:56.610
I showed that any geometric
random walk,

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.199
no matter where you start,
no matter what r(0) is,

00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:01.690
no matter what you start,
no matter what standard

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:04.027
deviation you go,
if you figure out the sequence

00:40:04.027 --> 00:40:05.836
of numbers,
D(1), D(2), D(3),

00:40:05.836 --> 00:40:09.097
D(4), not up to 30 years,
which is where everybody else

00:40:09.097 --> 00:40:11.237
stopped,
because bonds end at 30 years,

00:40:11.237 --> 00:40:13.389
but you do it for 100 or 200 or
500,

00:40:13.389 --> 00:40:18.907
D(t) is always eventually going
to be equal to some constant

00:40:18.907 --> 00:40:22.927
times t to the -1 half,
exactly consistent with

00:40:22.927 --> 00:40:24.170
Thaler's numbers.
 

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:26.369
So I don't know if that's the
explanation for hyperbolic

00:40:26.369 --> 00:40:28.088
discounting,
but I thought it was pretty

00:40:28.088 --> 00:40:30.583
interesting,
and anyone could have done it

00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:33.159
if they just didn't stop at 30
years,

00:40:33.159 --> 00:40:34.429
just kept going.
 

00:40:34.429 --> 00:40:37.655
And then there's some
mathematics, you could compute

00:40:37.655 --> 00:40:40.882
examples, but there's some
mathematics to prove that

00:40:40.882 --> 00:40:43.730
asymptotically,
that's the right formula.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.945
Okay, so in fact this paper,
I wrote this with a co-author,

00:40:46.945 --> 00:40:49.273
Doyne Farmer,
whose daughter is a sophomore

00:40:49.273 --> 00:40:51.989
here and whose son just
graduated by the way.

00:40:51.989 --> 00:40:55.570
He's in Santa Fe.
 

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:00.588
So if you look at the picture
here, you can see that these are

00:41:00.588 --> 00:41:04.210
the D(t)s when you exponentially
discount.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.891
I've got it on a logarithmic
scale, so if you exponentially

00:41:07.891 --> 00:41:11.130
discount, things go--the Ds drop
off really fast.

00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:13.230
That's the dotted line,
really fast.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.985
But if you do this random
thing, you get the thing that

00:41:16.985 --> 00:41:20.253
goes much slower,
and it goes with a slope of -1

00:41:20.253 --> 00:41:20.880
half.
 

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:23.934
Since I plotted things on a log
scale, that's just what this

00:41:23.934 --> 00:41:24.349
means.
 

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.817
Taking the log of this,
you get a straight line with

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:29.369
slope -1 half,
and that's just what we found,

00:41:29.369 --> 00:41:32.599
and we managed to prove that
that always has to happen.

00:41:32.599 --> 00:41:37.652
So if you look 500 years in the
future, you start with 4 percent

00:41:37.652 --> 00:41:41.018
and you assume a constant
discount rate.

00:41:41.018 --> 00:41:43.934
After 500 years in the
exponential, nobody could

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:46.539
possibly care about 500 years
from now,

00:41:46.539 --> 00:41:50.851
But 500 years from now is 1
percent as important as now [in

00:41:50.851 --> 00:41:53.750
the uncertain case]
if you discount--

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:57.179
if everyone knows the interest
rate is 4 percent now,

00:41:57.179 --> 00:41:59.190
and it's going to go up or down
and keep going forever,

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:03.260
so it's quite shocking.
 

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.510
Okay, so that's it.
 

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.969
We're going to come back over
and over again to this,

00:42:07.969 --> 00:42:09.860
and this is the yield curve
that you get,

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.889
the 0 yield curve like in the
problem set,

00:42:11.889 --> 00:42:14.699
goes up and then starts coming
back down.

00:42:14.699 --> 00:42:19.077
All right, does anyone want to
say anything about discounting

00:42:19.077 --> 00:42:21.340
or how to compute this stuff?
 

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:22.280
You know how I did this.
 

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:22.909
Yes?
 

00:42:22.909 --> 00:42:26.690
Student:
&gt;

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.340
Prof: Yeah,
okay, you mean the intuition of

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:31.829
why that happened.
 

00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:33.420
You computed it and you found
it happened.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.280
What's the intuition?
 

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.117
The intuition is that--so why
should this thing go up and then

00:42:41.117 --> 00:42:46.190
go down, just like you computed
in the problem set?

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:51.021
The reason is because if the
interest rate is moving in a

00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:54.556
geometric random walk,
so it's doubling or getting

00:42:54.556 --> 00:42:57.346
multiplied by 1 half,
the geometric average is,

00:42:57.346 --> 00:43:00.487
it stays where it was before,
but that means since the

00:43:00.487 --> 00:43:03.001
arithmetic average is always
bigger than the geometric

00:43:03.001 --> 00:43:05.478
average,
the arithmetic average of 200

00:43:05.478 --> 00:43:08.704
percent and 50 percent is
actually bigger than 100

00:43:08.704 --> 00:43:09.429
percent.
 

00:43:09.429 --> 00:43:12.597
So at the beginning,
you're sort of going to be

00:43:12.597 --> 00:43:16.385
doing this arithmetic average
and things are going to be

00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:18.518
getting bigger for a while.
 

00:43:18.518 --> 00:43:22.688
But when you go out farther and
farther, why doesn't that

00:43:22.688 --> 00:43:23.360
matter?
 

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.400
So what is the intuition?
 

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.891
And by the way,
this is a common thing in

00:43:28.891 --> 00:43:31.043
finance with--
someone named Weitzman,

00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:33.050
who was at Yale and now is at
Harvard,

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.059
did suggest this idea in
economics.

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:40.398
He said, for the environment,
you should always use the

00:43:40.398 --> 00:43:42.519
lowest possible interest rate,
and why is that?

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:43.639
Let's do an example.
 

00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:48.590
Suppose the interest rate was
going to go to 100 percent,

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:51.231
so you're going to multiply by
1 over 2 and then keep

00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.211
multiplying by 1 over 2 forever,
the interest rate stayed the

00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:54.469
same.
 

00:43:54.469 --> 00:43:58.815
Or let's say the interest rate
was going to be less

00:43:58.815 --> 00:44:04.030
discounting, 2 over 3 and was
going to stay there forever.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:05.789
Okay, and you get 1 here and 1
here.

00:44:05.789 --> 00:44:09.085
So I'm doing a very simple case
where 50 percent of the time,

00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:12.271
it stays at 100 percent forever
and 50 percent of the time,

00:44:12.271 --> 00:44:13.699
it goes to 50 percent.
 

00:44:13.699 --> 00:44:17.849
This is 100 percent and this is
50 percent as the interest rate.

00:44:17.849 --> 00:44:20.750
Stays at 100 percent forever or
50 percent forever.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.760
So you multiply by 2 thirds
forever or by 1 half forever.

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:27.148
So this could happen with
probability 1 half and this

00:44:27.148 --> 00:44:28.940
could happen with probability 1
half.

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.360
If you average this,
multiply by all the 1 halves,

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.750
and this multiplied by all the
thirds,

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.409
by all the 2 thirds,
the 1 half is irrelevant,

00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:40.605
because this is such a tiny
number compared to this one,

00:44:40.605 --> 00:44:41.070
right?
 

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.586
Because every time,
you're multiplying by such a

00:44:43.586 --> 00:44:46.585
small number up here compared to
this, this thing is just

00:44:46.585 --> 00:44:48.300
negligible compared to this.
 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:52.786
So really, the total here is
entirely given by what happened

00:44:52.786 --> 00:44:53.699
down here.
 

00:44:53.699 --> 00:44:56.467
Okay, so it's 2 thirds to the
Nth power times 1,

00:44:56.467 --> 00:44:58.469
plus a totally negligible
thing.

00:44:58.469 --> 00:44:59.989
Okay?
 

00:44:59.989 --> 00:45:04.460
So you're going to have half of
this value is going to be the

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:05.429
value here.
 

00:45:05.429 --> 00:45:08.018
So the high interest rate,
the 100 percent interest rate,

00:45:08.018 --> 00:45:08.760
didn't matter.
 

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.679
It's only the low interest
rates that matter.

00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:11.469
So why is that?
 

00:45:11.469 --> 00:45:14.440
Because in the random walk,
when you follow a random walk,

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.106
it goes like that,
so if you end up with a really

00:45:18.106 --> 00:45:23.440
low interest rate at the end--
so here we start with 4 percent.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:25.724
By the end, because it's a
random walk, you don't know

00:45:25.724 --> 00:45:27.710
where the final interest rate's
going to be.

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:32.079
It's going to be some normally
distributed thing like that.

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:34.657
You don't know what the final
interest rate's going to be,

00:45:34.657 --> 00:45:36.739
but the low interest rate's
here at the end.

00:45:36.739 --> 00:45:39.601
Here's where the interest rate
was the same as where you

00:45:39.601 --> 00:45:41.110
started, back to 4 percent.
 

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.889
So I'm not saying that people
typically go down here.

00:45:43.889 --> 00:45:45.349
That would be a ridiculous
assumption.

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:47.405
I'm saying on average,
they're at the same level they

00:45:47.405 --> 00:45:47.920
were today.
 

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:51.242
But the paths where the
interest rate ends up high

00:45:51.242 --> 00:45:54.090
probably were high the whole way
along,

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.215
so they kept getting
discounted, so they don't make

00:45:56.215 --> 00:45:56.940
any difference.
 

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.001
The paths where the interest
went low, the path was probably

00:46:00.001 --> 00:46:02.753
low the whole way along,
and that's why those are much

00:46:02.753 --> 00:46:04.570
more relevant paths than these.
 

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.690
So when you take your average,
to get it,

00:46:06.690 --> 00:46:09.518
it's going to be,
in this particular example,

00:46:09.518 --> 00:46:12.800
as if it was 2 thirds,
50 percent discounting forever,

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.684
but of course,
you're only averaging over

00:46:14.684 --> 00:46:16.619
these low paths,
so I have to put 1 half in

00:46:16.619 --> 00:46:17.139
front of it.
 

00:46:17.139 --> 00:46:22.199
That's why it's not t to the -1
half, it's an a times t to the

00:46:22.199 --> 00:46:23.030
-1 half.
 

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.099
Okay?
 

00:46:24.099 --> 00:46:28.567
So that's a vague intuition,
but it maybe helps a little bit

00:46:28.567 --> 00:46:30.989
figuring out why that happens.
 

00:46:30.989 --> 00:46:33.561
Okay, so I don't know,
this may have some significance

00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:34.630
for the environment.
 

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:37.273
So I personally think that we
should do something about the

00:46:37.273 --> 00:46:40.010
environment, even if it's only
going to be 500 years away.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:43.612
I don't think we should just
discount it to 0 because the

00:46:43.612 --> 00:46:47.664
interest rates are 4 percent and
4 percent to the 500^(th) power

00:46:47.664 --> 00:46:49.210
is some tiny number.
 

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.150
That is, 1 over 1.04 to some
500^(th) power is a tiny number.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:56.650
Okay, so I'm going to march on
now if there are no questions.

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:02.528
What's the next most important
kind of uncertainty that you see

00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:05.280
in the market all the time?
 

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.840
It's the chance of default.
 

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.673
Now we're going to see very
shortly that default and the

00:47:14.673 --> 00:47:18.090
possibility of default changes a
lot of things.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:22.434
But you could still be a
rational expectations guy and

00:47:22.434 --> 00:47:25.960
believe that default is just no
big deal.

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.793
It's just that the payoff,
which over here was 104 and 98,

00:47:29.793 --> 00:47:32.619
the default just makes the
payoff lower.

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:34.360
So what's the typical thing
that defaults?

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:38.039
It's a bond.
 

00:47:38.039 --> 00:47:50.768
So a typical thing that
defaults is a bond.

00:47:50.768 --> 00:48:01.112
So suppose I had a 1-year bond
from Argentina that could pay

00:48:01.112 --> 00:48:05.320
100 or it could pay 0.
 

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:08.170
This is an Argentine bond.
 

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.719
So you'll have to forgive me if
you're from Argentina.

00:48:10.719 --> 00:48:20.139
And then we have the American
bond that can pay 100 or it can

00:48:20.139 --> 00:48:21.710
pay 100.
 

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:27.639
Okay, so what do you see?
 

00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:29.809
These both promise 100.
 

00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:31.702
The American bond,
if you look at the market

00:48:31.702 --> 00:48:34.342
today, is going to sell for a
higher price than the Argentine

00:48:34.342 --> 00:48:34.739
bond.
 

00:48:34.739 --> 00:48:35.739
Why is that?
 

00:48:35.739 --> 00:48:39.793
Because people assume that the
American bond is not going to

00:48:39.793 --> 00:48:40.480
default.
 

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.347
So even if you put a 0 here,
they assume that the

00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:46.333
probability for the American
bond is 1 here and the

00:48:46.333 --> 00:48:49.559
probability of the Argentine
bond is some number,

00:48:49.559 --> 00:48:51.570
.8 or .2 or something.
 

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.389
The question is,
what's the number that they put

00:48:53.389 --> 00:48:53.659
here?
 

00:48:53.659 --> 00:48:56.599
So there's uncertainty about
defaulting,

00:48:56.599 --> 00:48:58.972
and if defaulting means paying
0--we're going to think a second

00:48:58.972 --> 00:49:01.215
about what it really means--
if it means paying 0,

00:49:01.215 --> 00:49:02.260
that's no big deal.
 

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.257
We just calculate--in the
expected payoff we have to take

00:49:05.257 --> 00:49:07.612
into account,
not the usual dividends and all

00:49:07.612 --> 00:49:08.630
that stuff 100.
 

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.244
We also have to take into
account the possibility things

00:49:11.244 --> 00:49:11.719
default.
 

00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:25.489
So let's look at some of those
curves.

00:49:25.489 --> 00:49:30.269
Oh no.
 

00:49:30.269 --> 00:49:32.360
Oh no, say it ain't so.
 

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.809
Did I forget the curves?
 

00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:36.590
Hang on.
 

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:44.989
So I've got another one on
my...oh dear.

00:49:44.989 --> 00:49:50.255
I got another one of my--I
think I'm on the internet in

00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:52.010
here by the way?
 

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:53.380
No.
 

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:55.539
Oh, I didn't realize this would
happen.

00:49:55.539 --> 00:50:00.572
When I lost the internet--I had
opened the file,

00:50:00.572 --> 00:50:02.929
but it doesn't--yes.
 

00:50:02.929 --> 00:50:08.070
Okay, this will only take a
second.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:22.539
Yeah, wireless, connect.
 

00:50:22.539 --> 00:50:24.050
Connection successful, okay.
 

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:32.262
So I can close this and this
and now I can--sorry,

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:38.800
it will only take me one more
second.

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.070
I beg your pardon for this.
 

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:42.110
I had it.
 

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.230
It disappeared when I walked
over here.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:48.320
It's going to take a second for
me to get on the internet.

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.719
So what could we do here?
 

00:50:49.719 --> 00:50:52.940
We could figure out what the
price of the Argentine bond was.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:00.150
So suppose the price of the
Argentine bond is 80,

00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:06.610
and the price of the American
bond is 95.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:12.106
What do you think--what does
the market think the chance of

00:51:12.106 --> 00:51:14.570
Argentina defaulting is?
 

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.510
How would you figure that out?
 

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:21.460
So let's write d here and 1 - d
here.

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:23.070
You don't know anything about
Argentina.

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:28.094
You know it's a great country,
they have wonderful everything,

00:51:28.094 --> 00:51:32.050
music, beautiful people,
everything, you know.

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.867
Okay, but their bonds happen to
sell for a lower price than

00:51:34.867 --> 00:51:35.840
American bonds do.
 

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.449
So assuming the American bonds
can't default,

00:51:38.449 --> 00:51:40.190
because we're just going to
print the money,

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.983
and Argentina might default,
because maybe they've tied

00:51:42.983 --> 00:51:45.791
their payments to the dollar,
so they can't just print the

00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:48.110
money,
what do you think D is?

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:51.980
How can you figure out what D
is?

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.239
&gt;
 

00:51:54.239 --> 00:51:57.710
Prof: Oh, that's bad.
 

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.449
Oh dear.
 

00:51:59.449 --> 00:52:04.467
Well, so you know,
in my Yale mail,

00:52:04.467 --> 00:52:11.550
this all goes to junk,
but this is really bad.

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:14.170
You'll have to cut that out.
 

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:18.179
Oh no.
 

00:52:18.179 --> 00:52:23.829
Oh no!
 

00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:32.130
You can't infer anything from
that.

00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:45.900
Okay, so here is the--let's do
JP Morgan.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:49.789
Oh what a disaster.
 

00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:53.050
Okay, so where did I get this
graph?

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.309
Let's just do this problem.
 

00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:57.583
So this is JP Morgan,
and this is the chance of

00:52:57.583 --> 00:52:58.510
defaulting.
 

00:52:58.510 --> 00:53:00.880
So you see that--oh no,
this is JP Morgan.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.824
What are the chances that after
1 year, JP Morgan's going to go

00:53:03.824 --> 00:53:04.679
out of business?
 

00:53:04.679 --> 00:53:06.952
The market thinks it's
surprisingly high,

00:53:06.952 --> 00:53:08.260
1 percent and 1 half.
 

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.780
I should have asked you what
you thought.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.280
After 10 years,
they think that JP Morgan,

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.418
the leader, the great
investment bank which is now a

00:53:15.418 --> 00:53:18.250
regular bank and the most
successful thing,

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:20.981
they think 10 percent,
the market thinks it will be

00:53:20.981 --> 00:53:22.840
out of business within 10 years.
 

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.260
So how did we know how to get
that number?

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.559
We can do another one.
 

00:53:29.559 --> 00:53:30.929
We can do Citibank.
 

00:53:30.929 --> 00:53:34.407
Citibank is a totally lousy
American bank that ought to have

00:53:34.407 --> 00:53:37.945
gone out of business already but
it's being propped up by the

00:53:37.945 --> 00:53:38.829
government.
 

00:53:38.829 --> 00:53:40.826
So of course,
people think the government's

00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:43.273
going to keep it propped up,
so over a year,

00:53:43.273 --> 00:53:46.907
it's actually got a smaller
probability or about the same

00:53:46.907 --> 00:53:49.847
probability as JP Morgan,
because everybody knows,

00:53:49.847 --> 00:53:51.920
the government's going to keep
propping it up.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:54.018
But then, you know,
eventually maybe the

00:53:54.018 --> 00:53:57.032
government's going to stop
worrying about Citibank and so

00:53:57.032 --> 00:53:59.726
after 10 years,
Citibank, what used to be the

00:53:59.726 --> 00:54:03.067
biggest bank in the world,
has got a 25 percent chance of

00:54:03.067 --> 00:54:08.556
going out of business,
25 percent it won't even be

00:54:08.556 --> 00:54:09.460
here.
 

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.159
Okay, so how did I know what
those numbers were?

00:54:12.159 --> 00:54:15.989
How did the Ellington trader
figure that out?

00:54:15.989 --> 00:54:18.664
Every morning they figure out
the interest rates and they

00:54:18.664 --> 00:54:20.909
figure out the implied default
probabilities.

00:54:20.909 --> 00:54:25.521
So what is the implied default
probability of this Argentine

00:54:25.521 --> 00:54:26.070
bond?
 

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.090
How would you figure that out?
 

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:33.530
Well, according to our theory,
what is the price of the

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:34.929
Argentine bond?
 

00:54:34.929 --> 00:54:35.820
It's 80.
 

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:41.710
What should I write that equal
to?

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:42.610
What?
 

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:44.710
Student:
&gt;

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.760
Prof: Okay,
(1 - d) times what?

00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.989
Student:
&gt;

00:54:50.989 --> 00:54:52.739
Prof: Okay,
well that's very good.

00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:57.018
So let me just see how
she--where are you?

00:54:57.018 --> 00:54:59.329
Excellent, but you went too
fast.

00:54:59.329 --> 00:55:01.889
You got the right answer,
but it was just very fast.

00:55:01.889 --> 00:55:08.355
So the payoff of the Argentine
bond is (1 - d) times 100 d

00:55:08.355 --> 00:55:09.489
times 0.
 

00:55:09.489 --> 00:55:10.719
So that's the expected payoff.
 

00:55:10.719 --> 00:55:12.739
That's what you expect to
happen here.

00:55:12.739 --> 00:55:15.929
But she went--so she not only
did that,

00:55:15.929 --> 00:55:19.329
but she went one step further
and she said,

00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:26.070
"How would you--you have
to discount it."

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:27.820
So how does she know how much
to discount it?

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.070
Well, you could buy an American
bond,

00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.902
just as well as an Argentine
bond, so basically we know that

00:55:32.902 --> 00:55:35.134
the discount rate,
the world discount,

00:55:35.134 --> 00:55:38.936
everybody has--the Argentines
can buy the American bonds and

00:55:38.936 --> 00:55:41.449
so 100 dollars for sure is worth
95.

00:55:41.449 --> 00:55:45.251
So according to our hypothesis,
you take the expected payoff

00:55:45.251 --> 00:55:48.409
and then multiply by the
discount, 95 over 100.

00:55:48.409 --> 00:55:53.820
So that's = just as she said,
to (1 - d), times 95.

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.230
That's what she said and she
was exactly right.

00:55:56.230 --> 00:56:04.496
So therefore you can figure out
that 1 - d is 80 over 95 okay,

00:56:04.496 --> 00:56:11.949
and so d is 1 - (80 over 95),
which is something like 15

00:56:11.949 --> 00:56:16.150
percent, a little bit more.
 

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:18.079
Maybe it's 16 percent,
something like that.

00:56:18.079 --> 00:56:23.940
So it looks like there's a
chance of 16 percent that

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:27.619
Argentina is going to default.
 

00:56:27.619 --> 00:56:35.152
So that's how they figured out
what all these default

00:56:35.152 --> 00:56:38.050
probabilities are.
 

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:41.880
Any questions about that?
 

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.820
Let's see if we could do a 2
period version,

00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.300
okay?
 

00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:47.059
So they've done 1 year.
 

00:56:47.059 --> 00:56:49.570
Now I'm not going to show you
what Argentina is.

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.760
Last year I got to show
everybody what Argentina was.

00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:56.786
Unfortunately,
my hedge fund's emerging market

00:56:56.786 --> 00:57:01.351
trader went out of business last
year in the crisis,

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:05.469
lost a lot of money,
so we closed it down.

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:11.260
So I can't show you what--it's
too complicated.

00:57:11.260 --> 00:57:16.179
I didn't bother to get all the
countries' prices and the

00:57:16.179 --> 00:57:17.699
default curves.
 

00:57:17.699 --> 00:57:21.237
We don't bother to compute them
anymore, because we're not

00:57:21.237 --> 00:57:22.170
trading them.
 

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:28.559
But we still are trading all
these potential corporate bonds.

00:57:28.559 --> 00:57:33.829
All right, suppose it was 2
years.

00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:43.909
Suppose we had a 2-year thing,
so this is the US.

00:57:43.909 --> 00:57:52.730
Now I'm going to do a
simplified version first and

00:57:52.730 --> 00:58:00.650
then we're going to have to
complicate it.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:08.882
Okay, so I guess I'm assuming
that we're doing--okay,

00:58:08.882 --> 00:58:15.849
so let's do the case where
we're doing 0s.

00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:20.329
So here's America and here's
Argentina and we're just going

00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:22.260
to be trading 0s,
okay?

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:26.184
So it's going to get a little
more complicated with their

00:58:26.184 --> 00:58:29.059
dividends, but not so much
complicated.

00:58:29.059 --> 00:58:38.119
So there's a 2-year...those
curves should be parallel,

00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:41.880
so here's Argentina.
 

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:48.385
Now let's say that the
American--so here we've got the

00:58:48.385 --> 00:58:52.559
1 year bond, pays off in yellow.
 

00:58:52.559 --> 00:58:54.630
So 1,1 here.
 

00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:56.239
And let's assume--it doesn't
really matter,

00:58:56.239 --> 00:59:01.840
but let's assume that that
price is .9 and then the 0,

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:03.829
the 2 year 0 in America,
which pays off 1,

00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:05.268
1,1 here.
 

00:59:05.268 --> 00:59:11.371
So I'll just write that in
pink, 1,1, 1,

00:59:11.371 --> 00:59:15.909
is worth 70--what did I do?
 

00:59:15.909 --> 00:59:17.889
.72.
 

00:59:17.889 --> 00:59:20.050
Okay, now let's do the same
thing in Argentina.

00:59:20.050 --> 00:59:24.514
Let's say the 1-year bond,
which pays off 1 here and 0

00:59:24.514 --> 00:59:28.559
there, this is default,
so it's probability d.

00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:32.469
Let's say the probability of d
is always the same.

00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:43.958
The 1 year Argentine bond let's
say is worth .54 and the 2 year

00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:47.849
is .216, let's say.
 

00:59:47.849 --> 00:59:48.840
So now what does the 2-year--?
 

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:50.739
So now we have to look at these
paths.

00:59:50.739 --> 00:59:52.920
What is the 2-year Argentine
bond going to be worth?

00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:57.518
It'll be worth 1 here, 0 here.
 

00:59:57.518 --> 01:00:00.710
But now if the 1 year Argentine
bond defaults,

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:02.340
it's the same country,
so if they've gone out of

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.039
business and aren't going to pay
their 1 year,

01:00:04.039 --> 01:00:06.070
they're not going to pay their
2 year either,

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.510
so it's going to be 0 here and
here.

01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:10.690
So let's assume that's the
payoff.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:15.268
So here we know the 1-year
American bond is 90 cents,

01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:16.590
the 1-year 0.
 

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:23.679
The 2 year American 0,72 cents
and the 1 year Argentine 0 is

01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:30.530
50--what did I say?-- 54,
and the 2 year is 21.6 cents.

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:34.594
So how are we going to figure
out what these--and why assume

01:00:34.594 --> 01:00:36.730
the same default probability?
 

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:38.597
I think I'll make it more
interesting and assume

01:00:38.597 --> 01:00:39.949
d_1 and d_2.
 

01:00:39.949 --> 01:00:44.021
After all, most curves it
changes, d_1 and

01:00:44.021 --> 01:00:45.300
d_2.
 

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:51.429
Okay, so d_2 is
actually quite irrelevant there.

01:00:51.429 --> 01:00:52.199
So this doesn't matter.
 

01:00:52.199 --> 01:00:54.590
So we've just got d_2.
 

01:00:54.590 --> 01:01:00.882
So solving for d_1 is
going to give me--all right,

01:01:00.882 --> 01:01:03.230
so what do I do now?
 

01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:04.349
How would I solve this?
 

01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:08.079
What do you think I should do?
 

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:10.349
How do I get d_1 and
d_2?

01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:20.590
Which would I solve for first?
 

01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:25.597
d_1,
this is...this is probably 1

01:01:25.597 --> 01:01:29.652
here, 1 here,
or it doesn't matter,

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:33.110
you can call them all 1s.
 

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:37.047
So in fact, let's put it in the
same tree and call this 1 -

01:01:37.047 --> 01:01:40.170
d_1 and this is 1 -
d_2.

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.079
This is Argentina defaulting or
not defaulting,

01:01:43.079 --> 01:01:47.610
and the US bond is still going
to pay what it's promised,

01:01:47.610 --> 01:01:50.492
no matter whether Argentina--so
this is the Argentina tree and

01:01:50.492 --> 01:01:51.579
this is the American.
 

01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:54.702
It's the same with the American
payoffs over on the right,

01:01:54.702 --> 01:01:57.333
on the bottom tree,
but it's the same tree on top

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:58.210
of that one.
 

01:01:58.210 --> 01:02:03.440
So which would I get first,
d_1 or d_2?

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:04.190
Student: d_1.
 

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:05.079
Prof: d_1,
okay.

01:02:05.079 --> 01:02:13.840
So I know that 1 -
d_1 times 1 (okay,

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:24.443
that's there) d_1
times 0 (that's the expected

01:02:24.443 --> 01:02:35.239
payoff of the 1 year Argentine
bond) times what = .54?

01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:38.887
Is that how I should solve for
d_1 or am I missing

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:39.630
something?
 

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.327
Student: .9
Prof: .9,

01:02:41.327 --> 01:02:42.989
you have to discount it by .9.
 

01:02:42.989 --> 01:02:45.550
So then we could solve very
easily.

01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.119
We would get 1 - d_1.
 

01:02:50.119 --> 01:02:55.730
1 - d_1 = .54 over
.9, right?

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.851
Because this is just 0,
so I just wrote 1 -

01:02:57.851 --> 01:03:00.530
d_1 over here and I
divided the .9 there.

01:03:00.530 --> 01:03:03.739
That happens to work out very
nicely to 60 percent.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:09.561
So we know that the chance of
default is 40 percent in the

01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:10.889
first year.
 

01:03:10.889 --> 01:03:13.588
Now what's the chance of
default in the second year,

01:03:13.588 --> 01:03:16.710
assuming you haven't defaulted
already in the first year?

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:20.150
If you default in the first
year, you've wiped out

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:23.239
everything anyway,
including the 2-year 0.

01:03:23.239 --> 01:03:31.369
So what should I write now to
get d_2?

01:03:31.369 --> 01:03:36.822
Well, with probability--the
only way to get paid is to go up

01:03:36.822 --> 01:03:37.469
here.
 

01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:45.561
So I'd have to go (1 -
d_1) times (1 -

01:03:45.561 --> 01:03:50.684
d_2),
times 1--that's the only way to

01:03:50.684 --> 01:03:56.989
get any money,
the rest isn't paying me

01:03:56.989 --> 01:04:01.809
anything--times what?
 

01:04:01.809 --> 01:04:04.889
Times what?
 

01:04:04.889 --> 01:04:06.860
I'm sorry, times what?
 

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:07.170
Didn't hear it.
 

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:08.039
Student:
&gt;

01:04:08.039 --> 01:04:09.460
Prof: .72, yes.
 

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:10.940
It sounded like 1 seventeenth.
 

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.280
Yes, .72.
 

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.929
It didn't make any sense,
1 seventeenth.

01:04:13.929 --> 01:04:20.521
All right, so .72,
exactly, is going to equal

01:04:20.521 --> 01:04:21.570
.216.
 

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:29.170
so now all I have to do is I
have to realize that 1 -

01:04:29.170 --> 01:04:36.041
d_2 = .216 over .72,
times 1 over (1 -

01:04:36.041 --> 01:04:38.820
d_1).
 

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:46.920
Okay, so that happens to be .3,
I guess.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:53.958
.3 times 1 over (1 -
d_1)--we just got

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:59.650
that, it was .6--over .6 which =
.5.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:03.052
(1 - d_1) we saw was
.6, so I've got a .6 down here

01:05:03.052 --> 01:05:06.320
and this over this is .3,
it's .3 over .6,

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:10.625
which is just .5,
so we now know that this

01:05:10.625 --> 01:05:12.829
probability is .5.
 

01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:21.690
d_2 is .5,
so 50 percent I could write.

01:05:21.690 --> 01:05:24.070
So actually,
it's quite interesting.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:27.985
We know that the probability--I
wonder whether this was

01:05:27.985 --> 01:05:29.510
cumulative default.
 

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:31.139
Must be cumulative default.
 

01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:35.389
So we know that things are
getting worse in Argentina.

01:05:35.389 --> 01:05:37.744
The first year,
there's a 40 percent chance of

01:05:37.744 --> 01:05:39.679
default,
but even if you get through the

01:05:39.679 --> 01:05:41.896
first year,
the next year there's going to

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.820
be a 50 percent chance of
default.

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.106
Okay, so things are getting
worse and worse and worse in

01:05:47.106 --> 01:05:48.780
Argentina in this example.
 

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.530
I'm not saying in real life,
but in this example.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.773
But by doing this,
for any bond of any corporation

01:05:54.773 --> 01:05:58.668
or any country,
you can learn a lot about what

01:05:58.668 --> 01:06:02.219
the market thinks about that
country.

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:06.599
So the market doesn't think
very much of Citibank.

01:06:06.599 --> 01:06:09.771
It thinks Citibank in 10 years
could have a 25 percent chance

01:06:09.771 --> 01:06:11.199
of going out of business.
 

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:13.777
And for JP Morgan,
it thinks a lot better of JP

01:06:13.777 --> 01:06:17.141
Morgan, but surprisingly not as
much better as you would have

01:06:17.141 --> 01:06:17.869
expected.
 

01:06:17.869 --> 01:06:21.909
They could go out of business
with 10 percent probability.

01:06:21.909 --> 01:06:24.070
There's very little chance
they're going to go out of

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:26.190
business in the next year or
two, mainly because the

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:28.018
government is there protecting
them all.

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:31.846
But in 10 years,
you know, it could be very

01:06:31.846 --> 01:06:32.940
different.
 

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:35.016
And so that's shocking to most
people, I think,

01:06:35.016 --> 01:06:37.592
a shockingly high probability
of those things going out of

01:06:37.592 --> 01:06:38.179
business.
 

01:06:38.179 --> 01:06:41.347
You wouldn't know yourself what
those things were,

01:06:41.347 --> 01:06:43.739
except if you looked at the
market.

01:06:43.739 --> 01:06:48.639
Now, I actually could have
computed the prices this way,

01:06:48.639 --> 01:06:51.440
which is the way we used to
compute them at Ellington,

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:55.610
but there's a more direct way
of computing them.

01:06:55.610 --> 01:07:08.469
There's something called a
credit default swap.

01:07:08.469 --> 01:07:24.170
A credit default swap pays 1
dollar in case a bond defaults

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:31.210
within some time period.
 

01:07:31.210 --> 01:07:37.177
It actually pays 1 dollar for
every dollar of principal,

01:07:37.177 --> 01:07:42.385
1 dollar in case a bond
defaults within some time

01:07:42.385 --> 01:07:43.579
period.
 

01:07:43.579 --> 01:07:47.019
So I assume here that when you
default, you get 0.

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.190
You don't always get 0.
 

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.211
Sometimes the guy is willing to
work out something and pay you

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:53.710
part of what he owed you,
because after all,

01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:56.945
Argentina, if they default,
and the US is angry about it,

01:07:56.945 --> 01:07:59.139
it can put a lot of pressure on
Argentina,

01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:01.342
refusing to trade with it,
doing all sorts of other

01:08:01.342 --> 01:08:01.739
things.
 

01:08:01.739 --> 01:08:03.840
Not that much pressure,
but some pressure,

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:06.219
and so maybe Argentina,
if it can't pay,

01:08:06.219 --> 01:08:08.664
it'll agree to pay less and
say, "Let's forget about

01:08:08.664 --> 01:08:09.449
the whole thing.
 

01:08:09.449 --> 01:08:10.880
You understand why we can't pay.
 

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:12.409
We're just--bad things happen.
 

01:08:12.409 --> 01:08:13.510
It wasn't our fault.
 

01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:15.699
It was unlucky,
so don't hold us to it.

01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:18.788
Take a little bit less and let
us get on with our lives."

01:08:18.788 --> 01:08:21.640
So instead of putting 0s down
here, maybe you would put a

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:22.760
recovery down there.
 

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.250
So we'll have to come back to
that.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.409
So in case that there's a
recovery, the credit default

01:08:27.409 --> 01:08:31.105
swap pays only the gap between
what it was promised and what it

01:08:31.105 --> 01:08:32.180
actually paid.
 

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:39.356
So it pays 1 dollar--pays 100
percent of the loss for any bond

01:08:39.356 --> 01:08:41.238
that defaults.
 

01:08:41.238 --> 01:08:49.595
So it pays 100 percent of loss,
in case a bond defaults within

01:08:49.595 --> 01:08:52.198
some time period.
 

01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:55.380
Now that's if you buy 1 credit
default swap.

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:59.224
You could buy 50 credit default
swaps on the same bond,

01:08:59.224 --> 01:09:01.930
so then you'd get 50 times the
loss.

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:04.652
So we're going to come
back--this is going to be one of

01:09:04.652 --> 01:09:07.475
the causes of the crisis,
that these credit default swaps

01:09:07.475 --> 01:09:09.140
got written that were so big.
 

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.301
So you wouldn't have to
actually do the computation I

01:09:12.301 --> 01:09:13.640
actually showed you.
 

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.206
You could just look at what the
price of the credit default swap

01:09:16.206 --> 01:09:16.408
is.
 

01:09:16.408 --> 01:09:19.671
Because here if the payoff is
0, that means the credit default

01:09:19.671 --> 01:09:22.720
swap is going to pay the whole
100, so its price is 16.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.104
That's telling you that
everybody thinks--it wouldn't be

01:09:25.104 --> 01:09:27.748
16--so what would the price of
the credit default swap be over

01:09:27.748 --> 01:09:28.658
here, by the way?
 

01:09:28.658 --> 01:09:30.180
It wouldn't be 16 as I just
said.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:30.979
That was wrong.
 

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:35.630
What would the credit default
swap price be over here?

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:37.460

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.840
Prof: Right,
so the credit default swap over

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.930
here would have a price equal to
16.

01:09:46.930 --> 01:09:51.390
The default rate is .16,
so it's going to pay 100 here.

01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:52.750
That's how much it defaulted by.
 

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:58.886
So it's going to be .16 times
100--that's what it pays--so it

01:09:58.886 --> 01:10:04.511
pays 100 with probability .16,
but then it's discounted,

01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:07.578
so it's times 95 over 100.
 

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:09.779
That's what the price of the
credit default swap is.

01:10:09.779 --> 01:10:12.992
So if you knew the price of the
credit default swap,

01:10:12.992 --> 01:10:15.260
you could equally get the
default.

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.840
This is d.
 

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.448
Over here is just d.
 

01:10:18.448 --> 01:10:20.408
So knowing d of course,
that tells you the credit

01:10:20.408 --> 01:10:21.020
default swap.
 

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.984
Knowing the price of the credit
default swap,

01:10:22.984 --> 01:10:23.788
you could get d.
 

01:10:23.788 --> 01:10:27.811
So you could deduce d in two
different ways,

01:10:27.811 --> 01:10:33.518
either from the American bond
price or from the credit default

01:10:33.518 --> 01:10:34.359
swap.
 

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:36.501
In either case,
you have to know the American

01:10:36.501 --> 01:10:39.520
bond price in order to figure
out what the discount rate is.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.210
So the credit default swap is
sort of overkill.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:44.743
It's another way,
it used all the information

01:10:44.743 --> 01:10:47.510
plus more to get the same answer
more quickly.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:51.090
Now what would the credit
default swap be worth over here?

01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:52.198
It's a little subtler.
 

01:10:52.198 --> 01:10:56.260
What's the credit default swap
worth here?

01:10:56.260 --> 01:11:08.649
So credit default swap on
Argentine 2 year bond = what?

01:11:08.649 --> 01:11:20.118
What would it be worth?
 

01:11:20.118 --> 01:11:29.854
How much would you pay for the
credit default swap in this

01:11:29.854 --> 01:11:31.050
case?
 

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:36.094
Well, 2 year bond over 2-year
horizon, okay,

01:11:36.094 --> 01:11:41.488
so it's only a tiny bit subtler
than before.

01:11:41.488 --> 01:11:45.970
The 2-year bond could default
in any one of two cases.

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:50.798
So it could default here or it
could default here,

01:11:50.798 --> 01:11:55.627
so you're going to get the
American .9, that's the

01:11:55.627 --> 01:11:56.908
discount.
 

01:11:56.908 --> 01:12:00.292
I don't know if you can see it
over there, so let's write it

01:12:00.292 --> 01:12:00.979
over here.
 

01:12:00.979 --> 01:12:05.733
You could get the American--so
over here, what's the value of

01:12:05.733 --> 01:12:07.158
going down here?
 

01:12:07.158 --> 01:12:14.484
It's 1 - d_1,
discounted by .9,

01:12:14.484 --> 01:12:18.328
times 100--times 1.
 

01:12:18.328 --> 01:12:22.590
I guess the payoff is 1 here in
this case, times 1.

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:27.220
Or you could get paid over here.
 

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:30.173
So when the 1-year defaults,
the 2-year's defaulting too,

01:12:30.173 --> 01:12:33.180
so you could get paid here,
or you could wait and get paid

01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:33.920
over here.
 

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:40.939
So here it's--no,
this was wrong.

01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:44.140
It's .9 times d_1
times 1,

01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.529
because to get paid over here,
you have to default,

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:50.016
or you can get paid over here,
which means you didn't default

01:12:50.016 --> 01:12:52.733
the first period,
but then you did default the

01:12:52.733 --> 01:12:54.619
second period and you get paid
1.

01:12:54.619 --> 01:12:56.649
But we've got to discount that.
 

01:12:56.649 --> 01:12:59.488
How much do we have to discount
that by?

01:12:59.488 --> 01:13:02.582
Well, we have to--the payment's
coming in the second period,

01:13:02.582 --> 01:13:05.310
which in America is discounted
at the rate of .72.

01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:09.104
So that sum is going to give
you the value of the credit

01:13:09.104 --> 01:13:10.140
default swap.
 

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:15.100
So d_1 we know is .4
and this is .6,

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.520
so it's going to be .36 .438.
 

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:31.150
So it's = to .36 .432--no,
.432 times d_2,

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:39.323
which is 50 percent,
so .216 okay,

01:13:39.323 --> 01:13:44.029
so that = .576.
 

01:13:44.029 --> 01:13:47.350
So that's how much you would
pay for the credit default swap.

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:52.993
Over a 2 year horizon on a 2
year Argentine bond you'd pay

01:13:52.993 --> 01:13:54.279
today .576.
 

01:13:54.279 --> 01:13:59.600
I think I managed to compute
that correctly.

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:03.779
All right, so I want to end
this discussion of default with

01:14:03.779 --> 01:14:06.193
one observation,
one theorem,

01:14:06.193 --> 01:14:11.500
which is that you can get all
these numbers incredibly fast.

01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.539
How can you get these numbers
incredibly fast?

01:14:13.539 --> 01:14:15.210
What's a trick?
 

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:17.679
If recovery is 0--I'm only
going to talk 2 more minutes

01:14:17.679 --> 01:14:18.000
here.
 

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.010
I realize I've come to the end
of time--

01:14:20.010 --> 01:14:28.750
if recovery is 0,
the chance of default--

01:14:28.750 --> 01:14:30.432
the defaults,
you know, if you default the

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:32.390
first period,
you default on all the bonds.

01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:34.773
If you default the second
period, you default on all the

01:14:34.773 --> 01:14:35.118
bonds.
 

01:14:35.118 --> 01:14:39.485
Then the trick that the young
lady who asked the first

01:14:39.485 --> 01:14:43.029
question pointed out right away
is that--

01:14:43.029 --> 01:14:46.188
I don't know where I wrote
it--is that the chance of

01:14:46.188 --> 01:14:49.595
default from the very first
equation is going to be very

01:14:49.595 --> 01:14:54.715
simple to compute,
because you've got the--oh,

01:14:54.715 --> 01:14:57.590
I lost her equation.
 

01:14:57.590 --> 01:15:03.502
Anyhow, okay,
because from the first equation

01:15:03.502 --> 01:15:08.744
where we had the chance of
default here,

01:15:08.744 --> 01:15:16.810
we just got 1 - d is this
80--okay, how did we get this?

01:15:16.810 --> 01:15:19.974
We had the price of the
Argentine bond is 80,

01:15:19.974 --> 01:15:23.641
compared to the--okay,
so the American bond price is

01:15:23.641 --> 01:15:26.158
95, so we just took 80 over 95.
 

01:15:26.158 --> 01:15:30.560
That ratio was the chance of
not defaulting in the first

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.118
year.
 

01:15:31.118 --> 01:15:33.538
Okay, so she did this
incredibly quickly.

01:15:33.538 --> 01:15:35.020
This was a faster way of doing
it.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:39.060
The Argentine bond is worth 80
ninety-fifths of the American

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:39.538
bond.
 

01:15:39.538 --> 01:15:41.529
They're only paying in one
state.

01:15:41.529 --> 01:15:44.404
That means the chance of
Argentina paying divided by the

01:15:44.404 --> 01:15:47.332
chance of America paying,
that's the only state where you

01:15:47.332 --> 01:15:49.319
get any money,
must be 80 over 95.

01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:51.466
So that's a very fast way of
figuring out what 1 -

01:15:51.466 --> 01:15:52.300
d_1 is.
 

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.398
And for the 2 period thing,
it's equally fast,

01:15:55.398 --> 01:15:55.880
okay?
 

01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.930
So you just do 1 -
d_2--all right.

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:02.804
I'm going to have to start with
this next time,

01:16:02.804 --> 01:16:04.760
but anyway, 1 - d_2
is equally fast.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.618
So if you look at it the right
way, you can compute all these

01:16:07.618 --> 01:16:09.000
defaults extremely quickly.
 

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000

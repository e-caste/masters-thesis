00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.133
RONALD SMITH: I wanted to
start out just by reminding

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:07.533
you, we've already talked about
how the tilt of the

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.300
Earth drives the seasons.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.700
But I wanted to be sure you
were aware of the standard

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.767
definitions regarding the
tilt of the Earth.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.133
The tilt of the Earth's axis is
23 and 1/2 degrees in the

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.633
current geologic era.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:27.500
And these things like the Arctic
Circle, the Tropic of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.133
Capricorn, the Tropic of Cancer,
and the Antarctic

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.700
Circle are based on
that tilt, right?.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.833
So the Arctic Circle is 23 and
1/2 degrees off the Equator

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:43.000
[correction: north pole].,
The tropic of Cancer-- of

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.200
Capricorn is-- both tropical
lines are 23 and 1/2 degrees

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.067
off the Equator, and the
Antarctic Circle is 23 and 1/2

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.533
degrees off the South Pole.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:58.100
So these really are all based
on the tilt of the Earth.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.300
One definition of the Arctic
Circle would be that it's only

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:09.733
points north of there that
experience 24-hour sunlight in

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:15.067
summer and 24-hour hour
darkness in winter.

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:22.500
Has anybody been north
of the Arctic Circle?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.533
No one?

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:24.967
I think you will someday.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.500
Try to get up there.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.600
I lived--

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.367
I taught in Norway for a year
and had a couple of

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.567
opportunities to travel
north from there.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.933
In the summertime, I went up to
visit my wife's relatives

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:46.500
up in northern Norway, which
is about 69 degrees north,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.533
just slightly north of
the Arctic Circle.

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:55.833
And we enjoyed spending a couple
of weeks with them, but

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.300
that's the period of time in
which there is sunlight 24

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.800
hours a day.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.300
So the difference between night
and day is lost a little

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.933
bit, and the people
adapt to that.

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:08.633
I remember the first night
we were there, we were up

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.500
drinking coffee at 1 o'clock
in the morning with our

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.800
relatives, and they suggested
that we pop next door to visit

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.200
their neighbors.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.933
And I thought that was a little
bit odd, or at least I

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.567
thought we should call before we
dropped in at 1 o'clock in

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:22.900
the morning.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.700
But they said no, no,
no, they'll be up.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.367
So we just went next door,
knocked on the door.

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.233
They were up drinking coffee,
enjoying the night.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.733
And so we sat there in their
living room for a few hours.

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.833
And a couple of hours later,
3 o'clock AM, their little

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:39.033
12-year-old came back.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:43.333
He'd been playing soccer with
his friends down the street.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.933
So the day just kind of rolls
around there, and people catch

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:50.233
catnaps off and on
during the day.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.633
Sometimes they sleep in the
middle of the afternoon.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:57.633
But you do lose your sense of
rhythm because you don't have

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:02.300
the dark of the night and the
light of the day to keep your

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.000
clock going.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.500
So that's an odd situation.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.633
Several months after that, I
was up in-- in the month of

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:13.900
November, I was on an
oceanographic expedition up

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.433
north of Svalbard.

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:20.633
We got to 81 degrees north at
the end of November, so that

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:22.133
is well north of the
Arctic Circle.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:26.267
And that's only a few weeks
from the winter solstice.

00:03:26.267 --> 00:03:30.500
So in fact, there was perpetual
darkness up there.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.833
So we were on the ship doing
our work, putting over--

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:36.700
taking water samples and
measuring things, and the only

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.300
light we had outside the ship
were the spotlights and the

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.300
floodlights from the
ship itself.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.933
I was surprised, because I
thought that even north of the

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.633
Arctic Circle in the winter, I
thought if I looked south, I'd

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:53.933
see a glimmer, some hint
that there was a Sun.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.800
No.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.067
There's absolutely-- even at
noon, you'd look south, and

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.533
the southern horizon-- which
you couldn't see, but you'd

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:03.433
look south--

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:08.200
no glint, no light at all, so
just as if the Sun pretty much

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.900
doesn't exist at that point.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.833
And again, you lose
your cycle.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.567
So as long as we had things
to do on the ship, we were

00:04:15.567 --> 00:04:18.233
standing regular four-hour
watches, four hours

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:19.433
on, four hours off.

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:20.933
And that had its own
kind of rhythm.

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:23.667
You'd catch sleep when
you were off.

00:04:23.667 --> 00:04:28.833
But then our work ended, and we
still had four days or five

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:31.567
days to sail back to Norway.

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.000
And then it was really tough,
because without your work

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.500
cycle and without the day-night
cycle, you really

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.100
were lost. And people would kind
of be wandering around

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.200
the ship, eyes glazed over, not
knowing if they should be

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.633
awake or asleep.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:49.067
And it's an odd kind of thing
to be north of the Arctic

00:04:49.067 --> 00:04:51.700
Circle, really in either of the
extreme seasons, either

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.200
the winter or the summer.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.367
So if you get a chance, get up
there and experience that

00:04:57.367 --> 00:04:59.433
different kind of
a climate zone.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:00.733
Any questions on that?

00:05:03.067 --> 00:05:06.767
So we're going to pick up
on this seasonal theme.

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:09.000
And how do the seasons
work on our planet?

00:05:11.567 --> 00:05:16.667
And I added a little
bit to this figure.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:19.000
I want to depict the Earth--

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.100
there's the rotation axis,
so this is the Northern

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.900
Hemisphere and the Southern
Hemisphere, June, July, and

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.967
August compared to December,
January, February.

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:31.067
And remember, June, July,
and August is

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:32.933
Northern Hemisphere summer.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:36.900
The Earth is tilted towards
the-- the North Pole is tilted

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.533
towards the Sun, so the Northern
Hemisphere receives

00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:42.233
much more heat than the
Southern Hemisphere.

00:05:42.233 --> 00:05:45.767
And all of the belts and zones
defining climate shift

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:49.133
northwards, both those in the
Southern Hemisphere and the

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:51.600
Northern Hemisphere.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.600
So the band of frontal cyclones
weakens and moves

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600
northwards.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.033
The ITCZ moves north
of the Equator.

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:01.967
Frontal storms which were down
here before move up there.

00:06:01.967 --> 00:06:05.033
And I've put in five cities
or five locations--

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.667
A, B, C, D, and E-- and
we'll talk about

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:08.767
those in just a minute.

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.733
So six months later--

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:12.567
December, January, February--

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:16.800
the Sun is hitting the Southern
Hemisphere more, so

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.000
all the belts and zones--

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.367
which, remember, are driven by
the Sun, differential heating

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:24.567
by the Sun, so it's not
surprising that they can shift

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:26.700
when the source of the
heating shifts--

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:29.033
they all shift southwards.

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:36.000
So let's look at these cities A,
B, and C. So the thing that

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.667
brings most of the rain to the
world would be either the ITCZ

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:44.033
in the tropics, which is that
convergence of trade winds and

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:48.700
lifting and deep convection,
or the frontal storms, the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.867
comma clouds, the cold fronts,
the warm fronts.

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:57.500
So in this season, city B will
be getting rain from the ITCZ

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:03.533
having shifted northward to its
location, and city E in

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:06.833
the Southern Hemisphere will be
receiving rain from frontal

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:10.900
storms that have shifted
northward to its location.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.500
So rain in cities B and E in
that season of the year.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.467
Six months later, it's A and D
that are receiving the rain, A

00:07:21.467 --> 00:07:25.033
because the frontal storms have
shifted southward to its

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:30.900
location and D because the ITCZ
has shifted southward to

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.767
its location.

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:35.333
So there's a rainfall
seasonality that can generally

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:37.467
be understood with this
kind of a cartoon.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.633
Now, as you can imagine, it's
going to be a little more

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:43.833
complicated than this
because of the

00:07:43.833 --> 00:07:45.033
continents and the mountains.

00:07:45.033 --> 00:07:51.500
So here's an actual depiction
of the ITCZ shift.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.600
And in the Northern Hemisphere
summer, it's located generally

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.633
along there.

00:07:58.633 --> 00:08:00.600
In Northern Hemisphere-- in
Southern Hemisphere summer,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.667
it's generally located there.

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:09.300
And it tends to shift more over
the continents than it

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.400
does over the oceans, at least
if you look at South America

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.533
and Africa.

00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:19.800
Notice that the Equator comes
right through here.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.933
And in both the Eastern Pacific
and the Atlantic

00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:27.500
Oceans, the ITCZ never
actually shifts

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.433
south of the Equator.

00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:31.467
And I think you know the reason
for that, because we

00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:34.100
talked about this in regards
to hurricanes.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.067
Remember, there are no
hurricanes in those two

00:08:36.067 --> 00:08:40.367
locations, and that's because
these two continents stretch

00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:43.767
far enough into the Southern
Hemisphere that they draw

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:49.267
water, cold currents up
into this region.

00:08:49.267 --> 00:08:53.800
And by keeping that area cold,
it's no longer possible for

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.433
that area to be the center of
convection, because that's not

00:08:56.433 --> 00:08:59.600
where you have a lot-- you have
a lot of heat from the

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.533
Sun, OK, but that's being
counteracted by these cold

00:09:03.533 --> 00:09:08.133
currents coming up in the oceans
in those locations.

00:09:08.133 --> 00:09:14.067
In the Indian Ocean, however,
you have an exaggerated shift

00:09:14.067 --> 00:09:15.967
in the Intertropical
Convergence Zone.

00:09:15.967 --> 00:09:20.233
And this is called the monsoon
effect or the monsoon region

00:09:20.233 --> 00:09:23.133
or just the monsoon.

00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:26.367
It is an exaggerated shift in
the ITCZ, giving strong

00:09:26.367 --> 00:09:29.467
rainfall seasonality to that
part of the world.

00:09:29.467 --> 00:09:34.433
The word "monsoon" comes from
an Arabic term "mausam"--

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:39.467
Sharif, check me on this
or look it up--

00:09:39.467 --> 00:09:44.033
meaning simply "seasons." But it
refers, in climatology, it

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:49.633
refers to this exaggerated
rainfall seasonality in

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:54.267
southeast Asia and the Indian
Ocean due to this big shift.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:56.467
Now, that shift I think is due--
most people believe is

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:59.333
due to having this large
continent up here, which can

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:03.933
heat up in the summertime and
draw air northwards and move

00:10:03.933 --> 00:10:07.367
that convergence zone
up over the land.

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:09.367
And then in wintertime,
this cools down.

00:10:09.367 --> 00:10:11.100
We saw that in the
continentality

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.967
diagram from last time.

00:10:12.967 --> 00:10:15.067
This mass of continent
cools down.

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:17.533
When you get cold air over it,
that cold air sinks and

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:18.933
spreads out.

00:10:18.933 --> 00:10:22.533
You get northerly winds, and it
drives the ITCZ way down to

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:24.767
the south here.

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:28.167
So the ocean currents are
playing some role in this.

00:10:28.167 --> 00:10:31.000
The continentality is playing
some role in this.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.100
Otherwise, you see kind of just
the shift that I had in

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.333
the earlier cartoon for the

00:10:37.333 --> 00:10:38.767
Intertropical Convergence Zone.

00:10:38.767 --> 00:10:42.267
This will dominate the control
of precipitation in the

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:45.700
tropics, and I'll be going
back over this.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:49.833
For example, let's look at
Rondonia in Brazil, which is

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:51.000
south of the Equator.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.867
It's somewhere in here.

00:10:55.833 --> 00:11:01.100
And what's plotted here are
the monthly precipitation

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.067
values in millimeters.

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:08.433
And notice that it has a
January-- or a November,

00:11:08.433 --> 00:11:12.267
December, January,
February maximum.

00:11:12.267 --> 00:11:14.667
Now, be careful how you
use the language here.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:21.700
This is Southern Hemisphere, so
this would be a summertime

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:24.400
rainfall maxima.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:30.267
And we would explain this by a
shift of the Intertropical

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:36.700
Convergence Zone coming down
to that location in the

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:40.233
Southern Hemisphere summer.

00:11:40.233 --> 00:11:42.600
And notice, it's a
gigantic effect.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:45.800
July and August are very--

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:51.000
June and July are very dry,
whereas the summer months--

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.267
be careful, these are the summer
months-- are quite wet.

00:11:56.267 --> 00:11:59.267
Question there?

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:05.200
If you look in India,
here's precip and

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.767
temperature plotted here.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.367
Let's just look at the precip.

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:11.300
There's a big maximum in June,
July, and then it starts to

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.633
decrease in August
and September.

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:18.033
We're in the Northern Hemisphere
now, and this would

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.233
be Northern Hemisphere summer.

00:12:20.233 --> 00:12:25.200
So this location also has
a summertime maxima in

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:29.333
precipitation due to the
northward shift of the

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.767
Intertropical Convergence
Zone.

00:12:31.767 --> 00:12:36.767
So on a typical day, you'd have
deep convective clouds,

00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:40.033
heavy precipitation,
sometimes flooding.

00:12:40.033 --> 00:12:43.567
And that would be a typical
condition in that season of

00:12:43.567 --> 00:12:47.300
the year due to the northward
shift of the Intertropical

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.567
Convergence Zone.

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:52.433
Let's look at this interesting
site--

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.267
I don't know how to say it--

00:12:56.267 --> 00:12:58.267
Yaounde, Cameroon.

00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:00.667
Pretty close to the Equator.

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:05.800
And you could probably see this
coming, couldn't you?

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.033
So we're here somewhere, and the
point is that this doesn't

00:13:10.033 --> 00:13:11.700
just appear there and
appear there.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.533
It actually moves
back and forth.

00:13:14.533 --> 00:13:17.033
So if you are close to the
Equator, you are actually

00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:21.833
going to get two rainy seasons
a year, one when the ITCZ is

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:25.867
moving northward past you and
the other six months later

00:13:25.867 --> 00:13:29.800
when the ITCZ is moving back
southward past you.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.133
So these mark the extremes of
the movement, but in between,

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:36.633
you're going to get, in
some cases, a double

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:39.300
passage of the ITCZ.

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:44.400
And that's what you see here,
generally kind of a double

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.600
rainfall peak due to the double
passage of the ITCZ.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:54.500
You can see this in satellite
images too.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.633
For example, here's
an image of Africa

00:13:56.633 --> 00:13:57.667
and the Pacific Ocean.

00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:01.467
There's the ITCZ
in one season.

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:05.933
And you see most of the
precip is up in here.

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:09.900
Here's the other season, where
there seems to be two.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.833
Maybe there is a weak one in the
Southern Hemisphere, but

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:15.933
most of the precip in Africa
has shifted down in here.

00:14:15.933 --> 00:14:20.400
And this is all cloud-free and
not getting any precipitation

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.267
at that time.

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:25.733
Now, the polar front
also moves.

00:14:25.733 --> 00:14:27.800
Everything moves together.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.100
And so in the Northern
Hemisphere summertime, the

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.300
polar front is weak, and
it moves northward.

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:36.367
Weak, of course, because the
pole and the Equator are

00:14:36.367 --> 00:14:40.133
getting about the same
amount of sunlight.

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.967
Therefore, you don't have very
much of a north-south

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:45.433
temperature gradient, and that's
what defines the word

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:46.900
"front."

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:52.100
However, in the winter season,
polar latitudes are getting no

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.733
radiation from the Sun, the
Equator is still getting a

00:14:54.733 --> 00:14:57.833
lot, and therefore you build up
a strong polar front, and

00:14:57.833 --> 00:15:01.867
it moves southward to roughly
30 degrees north.

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:06.200
But you see it meanders a
little bit around there.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.300
So if you looked, for example,
at Los Angeles and plotted up

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.033
its precipitation, it'll get
precipitation starting in

00:15:15.033 --> 00:15:17.567
November, then December,
January, February, March,

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:20.200
decreasing into April.

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.233
This is Northern Hemisphere,
so we would call this a

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:24.300
wintertime precipitation.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.767
Here's the temperature plotted
up here, so that rain is

00:15:26.767 --> 00:15:30.200
coming in the cool season, when
the temperature is down a

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:30.567
little bit.

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:34.567
So that is a mark of this kind
of a phenomenon, where it's

00:15:34.567 --> 00:15:39.767
getting its rain from frontal
cyclones that have moved

00:15:39.767 --> 00:15:42.967
equatorward in the
cool season.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.100
Here is Rome in Italy at 42
degrees north, and you have a

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.700
similar story.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.800
There's the temperature in
red, and it's in the cool

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.833
season of the year.

00:15:56.833 --> 00:16:01.067
We're still in the Northern
Hemisphere, so the cool season

00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:04.800
gives the precipitation due
to frontal cyclones.

00:16:07.367 --> 00:16:11.500
And here is Perth, Australia,
32 south.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.100
Now, be careful.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:15.667
We've got to flip everything
around here.

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:21.500
So the rainy season is in June,
July, and August. That

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.467
is wintertime, as you can tell,
because the temperatures

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:28.767
are minimum at that
time of the year.

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:33.833
And so that is a, in this case,
a northward shift or an

00:16:33.833 --> 00:16:38.900
equatorward shift in the polar
front, bringing frontal

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.500
cyclones into Perth
in the wintertime.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.700
So this all fits that picture
of shifting belts and zones

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:52.067
following the Sun.

00:16:52.067 --> 00:16:53.467
Any questions on that?

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:01.300
Now, some of this is nicely
summarized in a diagram that

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:04.100
appeared in a book by
Wallace and Hobbs.

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:07.800
They took rainfall data from
the Northern Hemisphere and

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:13.667
plotted it with little clock
arrows, little clock hands.

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:18.500
The length of each arrow is the
degree of seasonal change

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.700
in precipitation.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.233
So the longer the arrow, the
bigger the difference there is

00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:26.667
between the dry season
and the wet season.

00:17:26.667 --> 00:17:29.867
And the orientation of the arrow
tells you in what season

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:32.767
of the year do you get
the rainfall maximum.

00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:34.500
And the key is over here.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:41.433
So a poleward-oriented arrow,
such as these here, would have

00:17:41.433 --> 00:17:44.200
a July 1st maximum.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.467
That is a summertime maximum.

00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:48.000
This is Northern Hemisphere,
so I can use the word

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.133
"summer."

00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:51.233
And of course, now we know
what that would be.

00:17:51.233 --> 00:17:55.767
That would be the shift of the
ITCZ northward to bring you

00:17:55.767 --> 00:17:57.267
rainfall in the summertime.

00:17:57.267 --> 00:18:02.067
And if we look at India, Mumbai
here or many other

00:18:02.067 --> 00:18:04.667
places in southeast Asia,
we find those

00:18:04.667 --> 00:18:06.067
northward-pointing arrows.

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:08.433
So every time you see the
northward-pointing arrows,

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:12.933
including some over here, that
is the northward shift of the

00:18:12.933 --> 00:18:17.533
ITCZ reaching that location
in the summertime.

00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:19.300
But let's look at some
other locations.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.300
For example, in the
Mediterranean region, all the

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.133
arrows are towards the
south, which means

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:29.833
a wintertime maxima.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:32.300
And that would be,
of course, the

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.133
cyclones, the frontal cyclones.

00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:38.700
The polar front strengthens and
moves southwards, and then

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.700
throughout the winter, you have
storm after storm after

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:44.567
storm, frontal activity
that'll bring

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:46.167
rain to this area.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:50.700
And if we go around to
California, we find something

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.867
a little like that.

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:55.633
The arrows are a little
bit tilted.

00:18:55.633 --> 00:18:58.800
They're generally tilted aiming
towards the Equator,

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.867
with some lag.

00:19:00.867 --> 00:19:05.033
But that would be called,
as I'll describe later--

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:08.267
California is often described
as having a Mediterranean

00:19:08.267 --> 00:19:11.567
climate, because it has the
same kind of wintertime

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:17.000
precipitation that does
the Mediterranean.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.700
So that's a pretty
handy diagram.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.067
Now, there are some oddballs.

00:19:20.067 --> 00:19:23.600
There are some things
in weird directions.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.633
For example, the arrows here
pointing towards the

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.167
east, October 1.

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:32.867
Anyone want to make a suggestion
of why the islands

00:19:32.867 --> 00:19:38.167
here have a fall maximum?

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:40.300
Hurricanes.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.967
And so you can find exceptions
like that, where special types

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:50.067
of events may be the things that
bring precipitation to

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:53.467
the region of interest.
Questions?

00:19:55.967 --> 00:20:01.833
So this is a reminder, to
read you something here.

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:04.400
These questions we're asking
about what causes the seasons,

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.733
as you might imagine, these
are old questions.

00:20:06.733 --> 00:20:08.833
People have been asking
themselves these

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.567
questions for years.

00:20:10.567 --> 00:20:14.467
And Herodotus was very
curious about it.

00:20:14.467 --> 00:20:17.900
He was Greek, perhaps the first

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.900
historian, some would say.

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.333
And he spent most of
his life in Greece.

00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:30.100
But once in his life, he
traveled down to Egypt.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:33.367
And here's what he writes
about that.

00:20:36.333 --> 00:20:40.433
"About why the Nile behaves
precisely as it does, I could

00:20:40.433 --> 00:20:43.800
get no information from the
priests or anyone else.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.600
What I particularly wished to
know was why the water begins

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:51.367
to rise at the summer solstice,
continues to do so

00:20:51.367 --> 00:20:54.600
for 100 days, and then falls
again at the end of that

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.867
period so that it remains low
throughout the winter"-- he's

00:20:57.867 --> 00:21:01.700
talking about the water level
in the Nile River--

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.167
"remains low throughout the
winter until the summer

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:07.267
solstice comes around again
in the following year.

00:21:07.267 --> 00:21:09.800
Nobody in Egypt could give me
any explanation of this, in

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.967
spite of my constant attempts
to find out what was the

00:21:12.967 --> 00:21:16.467
peculiar property which made
the Nile behave in the

00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:20.800
opposite way to other rivers?"

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.033
So I'll leave it there,
but can anyone

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:28.667
answer Herodotus' question?

00:21:28.667 --> 00:21:32.900
Why does the Nile behave the
opposite to other rivers?

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:37.900
Want to venture a guess?

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.400
Yeah.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.033
STUDENT: In the summer months
its getting rain from the

00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:39.267
shift of the ITCZ, whereas in
the north where he knew, the

00:21:39.267 --> 00:21:40.533
frontal cyclones were
contributing more?

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.233
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:52.233
So when he says "other rivers,"
he's talking about

00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:55.067
all the rivers he's ever seen
in his life, which is

00:21:55.067 --> 00:21:58.033
generally the rivers
coming off from the

00:21:58.033 --> 00:21:59.600
Mediterranean region.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:04.367
And that's going to be mostly
wintertime due to the

00:22:04.367 --> 00:22:09.600
southward shift of
the polar front.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.133
The Nile, on the other hand,
actually, the water doesn't

00:22:13.133 --> 00:22:14.200
originate from here.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.167
The water originates
further south.

00:22:16.167 --> 00:22:18.733
Let's go back to my little
arrow diagram.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:22.133
Yeah, there it is.

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:29.600
So here's Herodotus spending
his life here looking at

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.567
rivers that have a wintertime
or a springtime maxima, and

00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:36.733
now he's down in Egypt looking
at water that actually fell

00:22:36.733 --> 00:22:37.833
down in this region.

00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:41.767
The source of the Nile, we now
know, is up in the Horn of

00:22:41.767 --> 00:22:44.433
Africa, over in this region,
and that has a summertime

00:22:44.433 --> 00:22:45.167
precipitation.

00:22:45.167 --> 00:22:46.733
So he's really--

00:22:46.733 --> 00:22:50.867
the answer to his question then
is exactly what you said.

00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:54.667
It's the fact that the Nile is
controlled by the water that

00:22:54.667 --> 00:22:56.900
falls here, which is controlled
by the northward

00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.967
shift of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone.

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:03.200
Questions on that?

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:07.567
So now we're going to--

00:23:07.567 --> 00:23:10.267
oh, I want to make this one
last point about seasons.

00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:15.167
So you being raised around
here or in North America,

00:23:15.167 --> 00:23:18.333
these latitudes, probably think
that seasonality has a

00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:20.367
lot to do with temperature.

00:23:20.367 --> 00:23:24.500
And you'd be right, but that's
a narrow, parochial attitude

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.467
from where you were raised.

00:23:26.467 --> 00:23:29.000
If you were raised in the
tropics, you would think that

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.867
seasonality has everything
to do with rainfall.

00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:35.100
If you make a figure like this--
and I think you might

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.767
be able to do this with some of
the data that you're given

00:23:37.767 --> 00:23:39.167
in the problem set--

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:43.000
if you take the 12 monthly
precip and 12 monthly

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.800
temperature points and plot
them and connect them with

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.367
lines that link them up in
chronological order, they'll

00:23:53.367 --> 00:23:56.400
form some kind of a figure
on this temperature,

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.867
precipitation map.

00:23:57.867 --> 00:24:02.733
And in the tropics, for sites
in the tropics, that figure

00:24:02.733 --> 00:24:04.667
looks like this.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:08.167
You get a big precipitation
seasonality, but not very much

00:24:08.167 --> 00:24:10.467
change in temperature.

00:24:10.467 --> 00:24:14.133
On the other hand, in
mid-latitudes, you get a big

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:18.567
temperature change but not much
change in precipitation.

00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:22.367
Now, this wouldn't apply for
every mid-latitude site and

00:24:22.367 --> 00:24:25.300
every tropical site, but
generally this is the rule,

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:28.600
that seasonality in the tropics
is referring to a

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:32.433
precipitation seasonality, a wet
season and a dry season,

00:24:32.433 --> 00:24:35.667
whereas seasonality in mid and
high latitudes is referring

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:38.800
primarily to a temperature
seasonality.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.100
So seasons mean different things
depending where you

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.300
were brought up.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.333
So don't get caught in that when
you're talking to someone

00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:47.600
from a different land.

00:24:49.867 --> 00:24:51.800
So now we turn to this
question of climate

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.500
classification.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.767
We'd like to codify
all of this.

00:24:55.767 --> 00:25:00.767
And the way forward on this
was over 100 years ago by

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:04.067
Koppen, and then later others
have modified this slightly.

00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:07.200
So there are a few different
versions of this scheme

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.867
around, but generally it's
called the Koppen climate

00:25:11.867 --> 00:25:13.200
classification scheme.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.267
It uses the 12 monthly
temperature and precipitation

00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:23.700
values with thresholds to assign
each point on the Earth

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.300
to a small set of
climate zones.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:32.833
And the way those thresholds are
designed is that it tries

00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:37.367
to capture those aspects of
climatology that would control

00:25:37.367 --> 00:25:38.800
the vegetation that grows.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.333
So ideally, if the Koppen scheme
works, in a particular

00:25:44.333 --> 00:25:47.800
climate zone defined by
temperature and precipitation,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.600
you would find a particular kind
of natural vegetation,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.600
because it's adapted to that
particular climate zone.

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.000
There are six broad
categories--

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.133
tropical, dry, temperate,
continental, polar, and

00:26:03.133 --> 00:26:04.267
highland climates--

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:06.867
and then as you know already
because you're working on the

00:26:06.867 --> 00:26:11.733
problem set, there are
subcategories under those.

00:26:11.733 --> 00:26:14.167
And well they're
a little bit--

00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:18.633
let's face it, they're a little
bit messy to work with.

00:26:18.633 --> 00:26:23.467
This is a table I pulled off of
a recent published paper on

00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:24.967
the Koppen classes.

00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:27.867
And it may be that these
definitions are a little bit

00:26:27.867 --> 00:26:31.433
different than the one you have
in the back of the book,

00:26:31.433 --> 00:26:32.667
but you get the point.

00:26:32.667 --> 00:26:36.667
That is, you define the broad
category, like the A climates,

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:40.867
in terms of whether the minimum
temperature is higher

00:26:40.867 --> 00:26:45.033
than a certain value, and then
you break it down into

00:26:45.033 --> 00:26:50.400
subcategories based, in this
case, on precipitation.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.867
The arid climates' precipitation
annual total,

00:26:55.867 --> 00:26:58.433
less than 10 PTH.

00:26:58.433 --> 00:27:00.167
I don't know what that is.

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:03.033
But then it's subdivided
into two categories.

00:27:03.033 --> 00:27:05.967
Desert would be the very dry
areas, and the steppe would

00:27:05.967 --> 00:27:08.233
get a little more precipitation,
and so on.

00:27:08.233 --> 00:27:11.600
So using the temperature and
precipitation values, you go

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:17.567
through and you classify each
area by its seasonal cycle and

00:27:17.567 --> 00:27:18.433
the mean values.

00:27:18.433 --> 00:27:20.233
And you end up with something
like this.

00:27:20.233 --> 00:27:23.300
I think this is from your
textbook, or you have a

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.000
diagram like this in your
textbook, where the color

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.167
schemes represent the different
climate categories.

00:27:30.167 --> 00:27:33.500
For example, the moist tropical
climates are the A

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.833
climates, Aw, Af, Am.

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:43.367
The dry climates, you find
they're the B climates.

00:27:43.367 --> 00:27:47.267
You find some of them in the
desert areas here and here.

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:50.367
And in the desert Southwest,
you find some B

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:52.333
climates, and so on.

00:27:52.333 --> 00:27:55.267
This is the Western Hemisphere,
North and South

00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:59.000
America, and then we do
something similar to that for

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:06.367
Asia, Africa, and Australia as
well using the same scheme.

00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:12.967
So it's not zonal, but you can
see zonal aspects to it.

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:15.367
But all of those factors that I
mentioned the other day are

00:28:15.367 --> 00:28:18.700
working, not only the zonal
aspects of the general

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.567
circulation, but also the
mountains, the continentality,

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:29.400
and cool and warm ocean currents
that are bringing up

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.367
water to the coastlines
of these continents.

00:28:32.367 --> 00:28:35.133
They're all playing
some role in this.

00:28:37.767 --> 00:28:39.300
North America looks like this.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.267
It's pretty simple east
of the Mississippi.

00:28:43.267 --> 00:28:45.533
West of the Mississippi, it's
more complicated, because you

00:28:45.533 --> 00:28:50.100
have some mountainous areas and
some contrast between wet

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.333
and dry areas.

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:58.600
Let's look at three cities
in North America.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:04.567
Sacramento, in California,
now, that is a classic

00:29:04.567 --> 00:29:07.000
Mediterranean climate, right?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.467
The precip is in the
wintertime when the

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:10.633
temperature is down.

00:29:10.633 --> 00:29:13.267
So Sacramento has a
Mediterranean climate, and

00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:17.700
that would be a Csa climate
in the Koppen scheme.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.733
New York City, close
to us, this might

00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:20.633
as well be New Haven.

00:29:20.633 --> 00:29:22.667
New Haven's very
much like this.

00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:24.767
Pretty much the same rainfall
throughout the year, but a

00:29:24.767 --> 00:29:27.367
very strong temperature
seasonality.

00:29:27.367 --> 00:29:29.500
That's a Dfa climate.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:36.033
Miami has a summertime precip
mostly from thunderstorms in

00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:40.533
the summertime, and then Denver
is a drier climate in

00:29:40.533 --> 00:29:42.767
general, also--

00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:45.367
well, it's a more of
a spring maxima.

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:46.800
We talked about why that is.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.767
In the springtime, you tend to
get these severe thunderstorms

00:29:49.767 --> 00:29:53.133
that occur in that part of the
world, because you get the

00:29:53.133 --> 00:29:56.300
right jet stream aloft and the
moist air coming in from the

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.333
Gulf of Mexico.

00:29:57.333 --> 00:30:00.100
But that extends to some extent
throughout winter--

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.000
throughout the summer as well.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.133
The reason why the winter is
so dry is because in the

00:30:04.133 --> 00:30:08.000
wintertime, those storms coming
from the Pacific lose

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.467
their rain in the Rockies.

00:30:09.467 --> 00:30:13.200
And by the time it gets to
Denver, they're pretty dry, so

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.900
you don't get much precipitation
in the

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.800
wintertime in Denver.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.500
Let's look at Africa
for a second.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:24.300
There's the Koppen scheme
for Africa.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:27.700
And let's look at the Af
climates, which are the

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:33.000
tropical rainforest. That's this
deep blue area here, a

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.500
lot of water and dense tropical
forest vegetation.

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:42.767
Then if we look at the BSh
climate, which is the steppe

00:30:42.767 --> 00:30:48.800
climate, that would be up in
here, these little golden or

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.033
yellow areas.

00:30:50.033 --> 00:30:54.900
They get one pulse of precip
every year when the ITCZ moves

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.167
northward, and then it's dry
for the rest of the year.

00:30:58.167 --> 00:31:01.933
So a brief rainy season
providing enough water for the

00:31:01.933 --> 00:31:04.567
grass, but you see now
it's browned out--

00:31:04.567 --> 00:31:07.767
well, still a little bit
green up there--

00:31:07.767 --> 00:31:11.167
and then that rain moves back
to the Equator and then back

00:31:11.167 --> 00:31:13.133
into the Southern Hemisphere
later on.

00:31:13.133 --> 00:31:17.600
So that gives you the
steppe climates

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.000
of Kenya, for example.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.467
By the way, these animals, the
wildebeests, are mobile

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:27.600
animals, and very often they
will travel several hundred

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:33.267
miles trying to follow that
shift in the ITCZ.

00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:38.133
So they don't understand it, but
they have evolved to know

00:31:38.133 --> 00:31:41.967
that if they move southward,
they can get a longer season

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:45.033
where the grass will be green,
and they can get

00:31:45.033 --> 00:31:46.267
good eating that way.

00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:50.133
And then you have the BWh
climate, the really dry

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:52.233
climates up in here.

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:55.233
That's the red one, the deep red
one, and of course that's

00:31:55.233 --> 00:31:59.967
a place where it really
seldom rains in any

00:31:59.967 --> 00:32:01.167
season of the year.

00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:07.167
The ITCZ doesn't get that far
north, and the frontal

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:10.700
cyclones don't get
that far south.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:15.200
So you've got this zone in
between where you've got the--

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.600
it's the descending branch of
the Hadley cell, of course--

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.200
the air is descending there,
keeping it from

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:20.967
precipitating--

00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:23.667
but that's because the ITCZ
never reaches there and the

00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:25.000
polar front never
reaches there.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.733
It's this dry area in between.

00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:31.000
Questions there?

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.467
India.

00:32:35.467 --> 00:32:36.933
Let's take a look at Europe,
for example.

00:32:36.933 --> 00:32:39.400
I want to get back on
this issue of the

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.467
Mediterranean climate.

00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:44.733
This yellowish is
the Csa climate.

00:32:44.733 --> 00:32:48.267
You see it all along the coast,
north and south coast

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:52.167
of the Mediterranean, and that's
why that is called a

00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:54.167
Mediterranean climate.

00:32:54.167 --> 00:32:55.533
Whoops.

00:32:55.533 --> 00:32:58.033
And so when you look
at Lisbon in Spain

00:32:58.033 --> 00:33:01.300
[correction: Portugal], it has
that characteristic of a

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.567
cool-season precipitation.

00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:07.367
If you look at Jerusalem, it has
the characteristic of the

00:33:07.367 --> 00:33:08.867
cool-season precipitation.

00:33:08.867 --> 00:33:11.033
Cairo, the same thing.

00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:15.100
So, you know, that's a pretty
common-- that's a uniform

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:15.767
climate zone.

00:33:15.767 --> 00:33:18.033
And then I've already shown you
this, but switch over to

00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:18.967
Sacramento.

00:33:18.967 --> 00:33:20.367
Well, it looks just the same.

00:33:20.367 --> 00:33:24.900
So that's why we say Southern
California has a Mediterranean

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.567
climate, because it fits that
general picture from the

00:33:28.567 --> 00:33:29.300
Mediterranean.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.667
And again, I've said this enough
times, but this one is

00:33:32.667 --> 00:33:37.433
due to the southward shift of
the polar front and the rain

00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:40.600
that comes in frontal
cyclones.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.833
Questions?

00:33:44.633 --> 00:33:44.733
Let's look at, let me--

00:33:44.733 --> 00:33:45.900
I think we're close
to the end here.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.233
We may finish a few
minutes early.

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:49.033
That'd be nice.

00:33:49.033 --> 00:33:52.167
Let's look at a couple little
additional examples of

00:33:52.167 --> 00:33:54.833
seasonality.

00:33:54.833 --> 00:33:57.667
Here's a couple of satellite
images taken from North

00:33:57.667 --> 00:34:02.033
America-- from South America,
where the Maranon and the

00:34:02.033 --> 00:34:05.367
Ucayali join to form
the Amazon.

00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:08.467
And at the end of the rainy
season, those rivers are

00:34:08.467 --> 00:34:09.300
pretty swollen.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.633
Every place you see blue,
that's water.

00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:15.300
But at the end of the dry
season, the flow in those

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.067
rivers is very much reduced.

00:34:17.067 --> 00:34:21.800
And what the purple color here
is are those dry sand banks on

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.400
the side of the river.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.433
Because the river is now lower
and moving much more slowly,

00:34:26.433 --> 00:34:29.233
you have barren, unvegetated
areas.

00:34:29.233 --> 00:34:32.433
And of course, this has been
meandering through time.

00:34:32.433 --> 00:34:34.500
On the field trip the other day,
we were talking about how

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.000
that meandering river has
flattened out the Quinnipiac

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.700
salt marsh.

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.400
Well, you see here, everywhere
you look, old places where

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:43.600
that river used to be.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.833
So that's been meandering back
and forth over geologic time,

00:34:47.833 --> 00:34:51.033
leaving all these little
remnants of

00:34:51.033 --> 00:34:52.967
meanders in the river.

00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:57.400
And most of that erosion takes
place in the wet season, when

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.600
the flow of the rivers
is high.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:07.967
Here in New England, the Dfa
climate, as I mentioned, it's

00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:10.767
a temperature seasonality,
rather than a

00:35:10.767 --> 00:35:12.667
precipitation one.

00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:15.600
And so the summertimes look like
this, with the deciduous

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.233
trees being out.

00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:20.300
Then they drop their leaves, and
it gets very cold and the

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:25.000
snow falls, such as
you see there.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.467
I put together a little set of
satellite images here to make

00:35:28.467 --> 00:35:33.833
another point about New
England's seasonality.

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:36.267
Looking down from a satellite,
you can map out the

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:40.733
distribution of vegetation using
something called NDVI.

00:35:40.733 --> 00:35:43.900
It's the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index.

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.800
It's the ratio of the
reflectivities in two

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.267
different visible bands.

00:35:49.267 --> 00:35:50.067
Oh, sorry.

00:35:50.067 --> 00:35:52.367
It's the ratio of the
reflectivity in the

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:55.267
near-infrared to the red.

00:35:55.267 --> 00:35:58.700
It turns out that vegetation has
a very strong signature if

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.900
you look at those two bands.

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.900
So here's four months, April,
June, August, and November.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.900
Now, as you first glance at
that, you may say, well, they

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.767
look a lot alike.

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:11.133
And I guess they do.

00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:14.067
But I'm going to take some
differences between these

00:36:14.067 --> 00:36:18.000
plots to try to bring out how
things have changed with

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.400
season, how the vegetation
has changed with season.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:26.333
And that's shown in the
next plot here.

00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:30.300
In this one, I'm calling it a
leaf-out index, because I've

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.533
taken the June NDVI and
subtracted it from April.

00:36:33.533 --> 00:36:38.100
So I'm finding how much the
vegetation has changed from

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:40.867
April into June.

00:36:40.867 --> 00:36:45.133
Well now, if you've lived in New
England at all, you know

00:36:45.133 --> 00:36:50.467
that the big event between April
and June is the leaf-out

00:36:50.467 --> 00:36:52.100
of the deciduous trees.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.900
Usually that happens in mid-May
here in Connecticut.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:00.633
And so when I take this
difference, what I'm mostly

00:37:00.633 --> 00:37:04.967
going to be seeing is the
distribution of deciduous

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:10.233
trees-- oaks, maples, and so
on-- and that's what we see.

00:37:10.233 --> 00:37:15.167
So the seasonality in New
England, while it is--

00:37:15.167 --> 00:37:18.633
at its root it's a temperature
seasonality, it also has a big

00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:21.067
impact on the vegetation.

00:37:21.067 --> 00:37:25.100
Leaf-on, leaf-off controlled by
that temperature, and you

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.067
can see it from space.

00:37:26.067 --> 00:37:29.600
Now, in areas where there hasn't
been much change, those

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.500
might be conifers.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.600
They look about the same in
the winter and summer.

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:39.100
Or they might be barren areas,
where there's no vegetation in

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:41.400
either season.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:42.900
Is that clear what
I've done there?

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.533
I've subtracted the
NDVI of April--

00:37:47.533 --> 00:37:50.300
June minus April to get the
difference in vegetation.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.233
And in this case, it's going to
show me where the deciduous

00:37:53.233 --> 00:37:56.533
trees have leafed out because
of the seasonality.

00:37:56.533 --> 00:38:01.567
I'm going to do the same trick
now for August minus June to

00:38:01.567 --> 00:38:06.467
see how vegetation has changed
over the summer.

00:38:06.467 --> 00:38:09.467
And you see these little pockets
of red are where

00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:12.433
there's a big positive change,
where there's much more

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:16.067
vegetation in August
than in June.

00:38:16.067 --> 00:38:18.100
And I'm calling that the growing
season, because what

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.833
that's going to do is pick
out the agriculture.

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:23.533
Farming in this part
of the world is

00:38:23.533 --> 00:38:25.600
usually a summer activity.

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:31.467
You plow and plant in the
spring, and then your crops

00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:34.267
grow-- your corn or your wheat
or whatever grow over the

00:38:34.267 --> 00:38:38.433
summer months, and you harvest
in August, September, October.

00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:41.167
So this difference between those
two months is largely

00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:45.300
going to be a measure of where
agriculture remains.

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:49.333
There's not much left in New
England, but we can see

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:50.667
exactly where it is.

00:38:50.667 --> 00:38:52.767
There's quite a bit of
agriculture in western New

00:38:52.767 --> 00:38:55.433
York State near the
Finger Lakes.

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:59.367
There's some in the very upper
Hudson Valley and up into

00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:02.533
Canada around Montreal.

00:39:02.533 --> 00:39:04.633
There's quite a bit down here
in eastern Pennsylvania.

00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:09.467
Those are the Amish farms
growing their crops down in

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:10.600
eastern Pennsylvania.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.433
A little bit in Connecticut
up around Springfield in

00:39:14.433 --> 00:39:15.267
Massachusetts.

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:18.233
And some places in Connecticut
you find some agriculture.

00:39:18.233 --> 00:39:21.067
But again, this is seasonally
driven.

00:39:21.067 --> 00:39:24.267
So human activity here is
being driven by the

00:39:24.267 --> 00:39:28.233
seasonality and ultimately which
goes back to the tilt of

00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:28.967
the Earth's axis.

00:39:28.967 --> 00:39:30.200
Any questions on this?

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:37.267
Now, another aspect of
seasonality for New England--

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.167
and this is particularly timely,
because we were just

00:39:39.167 --> 00:39:41.533
out on the river
the other day.

00:39:41.533 --> 00:39:44.800
So I've already told you-- and
I've shown you, in fact-- that

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.167
New England gets about the same
precipitation in every

00:39:47.167 --> 00:39:49.200
month of the year.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.967
Why is it then if I look at the
daily discharge data from

00:39:53.967 --> 00:39:59.000
the Quinnipiac or most other
rivers that there is a

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.833
seasonal cycle to it?

00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:03.900
More discharge in the winter,
less in the summer, June,

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:07.100
July, and August. Winter, less
in the summer, June, July,

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:11.367
August. It didn't drop quite as
much in the summer of 2006,

00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:14.167
but then it dropped even more
in the summer of 2007.

00:40:14.167 --> 00:40:18.600
This is a log scale, so this is
a very significant change.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.767
This is an order of magnitude
difference.

00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:26.633
Look, this is 200 to 300 to 400
cubic feet per second down

00:40:26.633 --> 00:40:31.900
to, well, 60 or 70 cubic feet
per second down there.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:35.333
So a gigantic seasonality
in the river flow

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:37.667
and yet not the rain.

00:40:37.667 --> 00:40:40.767
What's going on there?

00:40:40.767 --> 00:40:42.733
You've got to tell
me this one.

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:43.567
Somebody tell me this.

00:40:43.567 --> 00:40:47.000
STUDENT: The snow melting?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.467
PROFESSOR: Part of it, but not in the

00:40:48.467 --> 00:40:49.167
Quinnipiac.

00:40:49.167 --> 00:40:51.767
That would explain some of the
rivers further north in New

00:40:51.767 --> 00:40:54.500
England, but the Quinnipiac
doesn't get much snow.

00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:57.067
It's down here in Connecticut,
so that wouldn't explain it.

00:40:57.067 --> 00:40:59.833
We need another explanation
for this.

00:40:59.833 --> 00:41:00.133
Yeah.

00:41:00.133 --> 00:41:00.867
STUDENT: Evaporation.

00:41:00.867 --> 00:41:01.700
PROFESSOR: Evaporation.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:05.400
So remember, evaporation is--

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.600
(a), it's very strongly
controlled by temperature, and

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.400
since New England has a
temperature seasonality,

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:16.067
you're going to get a big
seasonality in evaporation.

00:41:16.067 --> 00:41:19.133
Also, from the trees.

00:41:19.133 --> 00:41:23.000
The deciduous trees evaporate
water from their leaves.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.500
As soon as the leaves fall
off, you don't get that

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.867
so-called evapotranspiration.

00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:31.400
So that's a big seasonal
cycle.

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:36.633
So during the wintertime, most
of the rain that falls ends up

00:41:36.633 --> 00:41:38.867
in the rivers.

00:41:38.867 --> 00:41:41.633
During the summertime, most
of the rain that falls

00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:46.167
evaporates, and much
less flows down the

00:41:46.167 --> 00:41:47.600
river to the sea.

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:48.867
So here's the question.

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:54.567
Does New England have
a wet-dry season?

00:41:54.567 --> 00:41:56.967
Well, that depends on how you
define it, doesn't it?

00:41:56.967 --> 00:42:01.067
Because it doesn't have much
of a seasonal variation in

00:42:01.067 --> 00:42:04.767
precipitation, and yet it's got
a strong seasonality in

00:42:04.767 --> 00:42:08.633
the amount of water in the
rivers because of the

00:42:08.633 --> 00:42:12.700
evaporation effect.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.967
Questions on that?

00:42:17.167 --> 00:42:20.567
And I think that's the last
one, almost the last one.

00:42:20.567 --> 00:42:26.867
So I took a couple of satellite
images from Alaska,

00:42:26.867 --> 00:42:29.600
one in June and one
in November.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.833
And June, early summer, there's
still a lot of snow

00:42:33.833 --> 00:42:36.100
cover from the previous year.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:40.400
The melting has begun there, but
it takes several months of

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.067
warm conditions before you get
rid of most of that snow.

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:46.600
So you see snow, a little
bit of barren land,

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.867
some water out here.

00:42:48.867 --> 00:42:53.000
In November, next month,
it looks so different.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.800
Well, part of that is because
there happened to be more

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.500
clouds on that day, but I wanted
to make a couple of

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:57.867
other points.

00:42:57.867 --> 00:43:02.333
There's actually less snow then
than there was earlier,

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:04.967
because the snowfall
is just beginning.

00:43:04.967 --> 00:43:07.733
But here's the thing I wanted to
show you that intrigued me.

00:43:07.733 --> 00:43:09.667
I hope you can see that
from the back.

00:43:09.667 --> 00:43:14.000
There's a curious little line,
a little dark-light contrast

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.533
right there.

00:43:15.533 --> 00:43:19.300
And that is evidence of
the low Sun angle.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.500
Remember, in this season of
the year in Alaska, high

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.300
latitudes, the local solar
zenith angle is going to be

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.100
quite large.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.533
That Sun is slanting in
at a very low angle.

00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:33.600
And that little line I'm seeing
there is the shadow of

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.767
this mountain range cast across
the valley onto the

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:40.533
facing slope.

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:44.367
So not too relevant for
climatology, I grant you, but

00:43:44.367 --> 00:43:48.767
a reminder that the Sun angle
is very low at that season.

00:43:48.767 --> 00:43:51.800
And that itself, I guess, is
a kind of seasonality.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.800
If you lived down in this
valley, you wouldn't see any

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.867
sunlight in the wintertime, but
you might in the summer

00:43:59.867 --> 00:44:01.967
when the Sun's higher
in the sky.

00:44:01.967 --> 00:44:06.200
But then you'd have snow at that
earlier part of the year.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.800
And then just to remind you that
it's not just this smooth

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.300
cycle of the seasons that
matters, but it's the events

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:21.000
that can also matter and would
be normally considered to be

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.100
part of the climatology.

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.867
For example, hurricanes, which
are discrete events, and you

00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:28.333
may not even get one in any
particular year, but still,

00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:33.200
they occur in the late summer or
fall in either hemisphere.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.900
Severe Oklahoma thunderstorms
are a springtime phenomenon.

00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.833
Nor'easters in New England
are wintertime.

00:44:38.833 --> 00:44:41.833
California fires are primarily
in the fall.

00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.333
Antarctic ozone hole--

00:44:43.333 --> 00:44:45.733
we'll discuss that later
in the course--

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:47.133
occurs in October.

00:44:47.133 --> 00:44:49.633
And El Nino when it starts up--
we'll discuss this too--

00:44:49.633 --> 00:44:51.700
usually starts up in December.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:55.133
So it's not just a smooth cycle
of the seasons, but it's

00:44:55.133 --> 00:44:59.333
the way the seasons control
events that can be quite

00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:02.600
important as well.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:05.567
Any questions on this or
anything else about

00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:06.833
seasonality?

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:11.533
I think that's it today.

RONALD SMITH:  We're finishing 
up a section

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.867
on storms here, and we've
talked about convective

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:16.867
storms. That is, air mass
thunderstorms, severe

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:17.700
thunderstorms--

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.367
oh, by the way, I've been
calling these things severe

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.267
thunderstorms. When you're
reading the book, notice they

00:00:23.267 --> 00:00:27.833
have subdivided that category
into three or four smaller

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.033
categories.

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:31.667
You've got your squall lines and
your mesoscale convective

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:32.467
systems, and so on.

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:35.100
So just remember, again, they're
going into this in

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.333
somewhat more detail than
I did in class.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:41.233
And then the third category
we had was hurricanes.

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:44.967
And we finished that
up last time.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.533
But if there are any questions
on these convective storms,

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:54.633
this would be a time to bring
other points out.

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:56.633
Any questions about hurricanes
that you've thought about

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:57.900
since last time?

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:01.433
No?

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.700
OK.

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.900
Well then, the last category
that we'll be

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.667
doing is quite different.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.400
It's the mid-latitude
frontal cyclone.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200
And as I mentioned in the
beginning of the section, this

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.767
gets its energy source from
a different place.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.767
All the convective storms get
their energy from the release

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:23.033
of latent heat as water
vapor condenses to

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.600
form liquid or ice.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.933
But not these.

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:29.167
These come from horizontal
temperature gradients.

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:33.967
The point is that, if you've got
cold air next to warm air,

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.633
there is potential
energy there.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:39.333
Because the warm air wants to
rise, and the cold air wants

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:43.033
to sink and spread underneath
the warm air.

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:47.233
So if I were to release--

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.900
if I had a wall, for example,
separating the warm air and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.400
the cold air, and I suddenly
remove that wall, things would

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.433
start to change.

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:56.633
The warm air would rise up.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:58.733
The cold air would slump
and slide under.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:03.300
So there is energy available
when you've got these lateral

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.267
temperature gradients.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:09.000
And that is the source of energy
for frontal cyclones.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.133
So this name is a long one,
but mid-latitude tells us

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.367
where these things form.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.733
Frontal-- a front is
a boundary between

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.067
cold and warm air.

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.233
And, of course, this is a little
bit redundant, because

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:25.933
mid-latitudes is the region
where you get the strongest

00:02:25.933 --> 00:02:28.833
contrast between cold
air to the north and

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:30.000
warm air to the south.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.500
So there's a little bit
of redundancy here.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.200
But then it's a cyclone.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.067
It ends up being a
counterclockwise circulation

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.733
in the northern hemisphere,
just like a hurricane.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:44.133
But the dynamics and the details
are really quite

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:47.800
different, even though they
end up with a circulation

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.633
around a low pressure center,
just like a hurricane.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.967
They grow from a disturbance
along the polar front.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:58.900
The polar front is this boundary
that goes around the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.000
earth in mid-latitudes,
separating cold from warm air.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.733
And when a little kink develops
in that boundary, as

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:07.533
I'll show you, it
then grows and

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.367
develops a frontal cyclone.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:15.267
Because they occur in the belt
of westerlies, as they evolve

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:18.467
and grow they move from
west to east--

00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:22.733
not always directly from west to
east, maybe at some angle.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.633
But generally they move from
west to east. I've never--

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.833
I don't think I've ever seen
a frontal cyclone that went

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.667
backwards, that moved towards
the west as it developed.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.867
They all move east
in some way.

00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:38.367
And eventually-- so these storms
do have a life cycle.

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:40.700
They don't last forever.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.067
They start from a little kink
in the polar front.

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:44.167
They grow.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.767
And as I will show, once the
warm air has all been lifted

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:52.533
upwards, then the energy source
is gone, and these

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.533
storms will begin to die.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.500
So they do have a natural
life cycle.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
Typically, they last--

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.900
I don't know-- five to seven
days as they move across the

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.500
landscape from west to east.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.800
So here's a simple
picture of one.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.667
It's got the classic features
of the low pressure center,

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:19.533
the cold front, and
the warm front.

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.967
And also scattered around the
diagram are some of the

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:25.700
indications of some of
the types of local

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.467
weather that you get.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:30.733
So I'll come back to define
these fronts in just a minute,

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:35.033
but first of all you've got some
rain showers along the

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.267
cold front.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:40.567
In this case you've got some
freezing rain up here.

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:41.867
Remember what causes that.

00:04:41.867 --> 00:04:47.133
That's that cold aloft warm and
then cold near the surface

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:50.200
that can supercool those
raindrops before

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.800
they hit the surface.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.733
And you've got the light
snow here, heavy snow

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.667
back in the cold air.

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:02.167
So a lot of local types of
weather are going along with

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:03.700
this large scale storm.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.633
Now in order to make any sense
of frontal cyclones, you have

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:11.300
to know the different
definitions of the fronts.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.533
The word front by itself
simply means a boundary

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:17.533
between warm and cold air.

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:24.700
A cold front, indicated by the
filled triangles, is when the

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.000
cold air is advancing.

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.400
A warm front, indicated by the
filled half-circles, is when

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.700
the warm air is advancing.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.100
So those little symbols are
telling you how these fronts

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.900
are moving.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.067
The cold air is back here.

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:42.800
The warm air is there.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.533
So we know, because that's
defined as a cold front, we

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:47.467
know that it's moving
in this direction.

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:50.167
This one, the warm air is here,
the cold air there.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.400
It's a warm front,
so that means

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.533
the warm air is advancing.

00:05:53.533 --> 00:05:54.867
It must be moving in
that direction.

00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:57.933
So in a way, those are telling
you a little bit about motion,

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:00.967
how that front is moving
with time.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.333
So thats a-- a few other
definitions--

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:10.000
this little sector back here
is called the warm sector.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.433
And of course it has warm
air moving up, very

00:06:13.433 --> 00:06:14.700
often in New Haven.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.667
Very often that air is coming
from the Caribbean.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.300
And behind it you've
got cold air.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.767
And usually that's coming
down from Canada.

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:26.933
So you end up with a contrast
here, across the cold front

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.267
between air masses of
different sources--

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:33.900
Caribbean area here,
Canadian air here.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:39.100
Notice also, this meets the
criteria that I laid out a day

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.500
or two ago about needing to
transport heat northwards.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.800
So here's northward-moving
warm air,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.133
southward-moving cold air.

00:06:51.133 --> 00:06:55.533
Probably the same amount of air
altogether is moving, but

00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:59.100
there's a net transport
of heat.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.400
Because you're pushing warm
air northward and cold air

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.867
southward, there's a
net amount of heat

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:05.700
being carried northward.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.667
And that helps to balance the
excess solar radiation near

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:16.400
the equator, and the deficit of
solar radiation and emitted

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.533
radiation near the pole.

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:21.667
So this plays a big role
in the general

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:23.733
circulation as well.

00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:28.533
Questions so far on
frontal cyclone?

00:07:28.533 --> 00:07:32.400
So here, now, is the
history of one.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.233
It starts as a little dimple
in the polar front.

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:44.200
And already you can see
the characteristics.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.833
The cold air begins to advance,
so we can label that

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.500
as a cold front.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.600
The warm air begins to push
northward, so it can be

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.033
labeled as a warm front.

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.067
But it's very weak.

00:07:56.067 --> 00:08:00.067
A day or two later it'll
look more like this.

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:08.967
This is a fully developed,
mature cyclone--

00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:13.333
low pressure center, cold
front, warm front, warm

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:17.167
sector, cold air from behind.

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:19.967
Then it goes to this stage.

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:24.167
This is called the
early occlusion.

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:29.900
And the word occlusion refers to
the fact that now the cold

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.500
fronts and the warm fronts, at
least in the northern part--

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.100
not here but up here--

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.133
they're beginning to
come together.

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:41.167
I want to try to describe
that to you.

00:08:41.167 --> 00:08:43.633
And the main thing you
have to recognize--

00:08:43.633 --> 00:08:46.467
I'll try to do it here on the
table and hope you can see me.

00:08:46.467 --> 00:08:49.867
These fronts are drawn where
they intersect the

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:51.100
surface of the Earth.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.733
But they're not vertical
boundaries in the atmosphere.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:58.333
They are tilted boundaries
between cold and warm air.

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:02.700
So for example, here's the
cold front with cold air

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.533
underneath the wedge.

00:09:04.533 --> 00:09:08.633
Here's the warm front with cold
air underneath the wedge.

00:09:08.633 --> 00:09:12.533
And when they come together
like this, now they're

00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:14.533
occluding, because they
have touched at the

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:15.733
surface of the Earth.

00:09:15.733 --> 00:09:17.767
I'll lift it up and pretend
the surface of

00:09:17.767 --> 00:09:18.933
the Earth is here.

00:09:18.933 --> 00:09:22.000
When they come together like
this, now they are occluding.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.733
And notice that the warm air,
which was in the middle, has

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:27.200
been pinched off the ground.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.500
Now the warm air is up, and
you've got cold air and cold

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.700
air that have touched
each other at the

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:34.433
surface of the Earth.

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:38.567
So that's the meaning of
the word occlusion.

00:09:38.567 --> 00:09:41.867
It's where the cold front and
the warm front have come

00:09:41.867 --> 00:09:46.000
together, pinching the
warm air upwards.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.767
And that is where it
wants to be, right?

00:09:47.767 --> 00:09:48.733
Warm air is buoyant.

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:49.467
It wants to be up.

00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:54.800
So as soon as the occlusion
begins, then the energy source

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.367
to keep this storm going
begins to weaken.

00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:01.533
This is the early occlusion.

00:10:01.533 --> 00:10:04.167
And now we can say, cold
front, warm front, and

00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:05.200
occluded front.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.033
Notice the symbols
they're using.

00:10:07.033 --> 00:10:11.367
They put the warm front and the
cold front together on the

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:14.067
same side of the line,
indicating that's now an

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:15.433
occluded front.

00:10:15.433 --> 00:10:18.500
And here, it's occluded all
the way down to there.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.800
And you've only got a little bit
of the original cold and

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.500
warm front.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.667
This one, they've labeled
it late occlusion.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:27.233
This storm is dying at this
point, it's weakening.

00:10:27.233 --> 00:10:30.000
Due to friction and so on, the
energy source is gone.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.400
Friction is acting
to decay it.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.367
Typically, it'll take five to
seven days to go from this

00:10:36.367 --> 00:10:38.133
stage to that stage.

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.933
And by that time, it's probably
traveled 5,000 or

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:45.000
10,000 kilometers from west to
east. This storm may have

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.733
begun to form east of the Rocky
Mountains, and it may

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:49.900
finally occlude as
it's approaching

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.933
Greenland, or even England.

00:10:51.933 --> 00:10:55.733
So these things travel a long
distance while they are going

00:10:55.733 --> 00:11:00.533
through this kind
of a life cycle.

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:01.800
Questions on that?

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.033
So this is another cartoon.

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:13.700
But this one shows a little bit
of that tilted structure.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.867
So here's the map view--

00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:19.333
north, south, east, west.
There's the cold front, the

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.700
warm front, the warm sector.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.933
Now if I do a vertical slice of
the atmosphere here, it's

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:28.133
drawn at the bottom.

00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:32.300
There's the sloping
cold front.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.867
And where it hits the
ground is where it's

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:35.867
marked on this map.

00:11:35.867 --> 00:11:38.367
There's the sloping
warm front.

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.400
And where it hits the ground
is marked on the map there.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.533
And there are some
characteristic cloud patterns

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:45.933
that are connected with
these fronts.

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:46.800
Here--

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:51.567
cirrus, cirrostratus,
altostratus, nimbostratus.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:58.567
Nimbo means rain, and you
see it's raining there.

00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:01.967
And these are generally stratus
clouds out ahead of

00:12:01.967 --> 00:12:03.300
the warm front.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.167
The cold front-- because you're
lifting warmer air with

00:12:06.167 --> 00:12:09.267
more moisture in it, air that's
in the warm sector,

00:12:09.267 --> 00:12:11.700
possibly air that's come
up from the Caribbean--

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:15.000
you tend to get more
instability.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.233
That's a little cumulonimbus
cloud there.

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:20.767
Or maybe in some cases
it's stratus--

00:12:20.767 --> 00:12:22.867
nimbostratus and altocumulus.

00:12:22.867 --> 00:12:26.733
But these tend to be more
unstable near the position of

00:12:26.733 --> 00:12:29.500
the cold front.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:34.600
And then cold air back here,
warm and cold again here.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.900
But remember, because this is
a cold front-- not labeled

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.333
here-- but this is a
cold front, it's

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:39.633
moving in that direction.

00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:41.900
This is a warm front, which
means it's moving in that

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.700
direction also, towards the
right in that diagram.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.000
So if we back out now and look
at a larger piece of the

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.100
Northern Hemisphere on a typical
day, anytime between

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.600
now and next April, when
you're getting strong

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.633
temperature gradients north to
south, this is typically what

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:04.200
it looks like.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.800
So, generally, you've got the
polar front wrapping all the

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.033
way around the globe in
mid-latitudes, with a fairly

00:13:12.033 --> 00:13:14.233
strong temperature gradient
across it.

00:13:14.233 --> 00:13:16.500
And then, at different
places it'll be

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.300
doing different things.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:20.900
So on this little diagram you've
got an occluded frontal

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.667
cyclone here.

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:26.367
You've got a mature one here and
one that's just starting

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.333
out here, for example.

00:13:29.333 --> 00:13:33.067
And the fronts are labeled
accordingly, cold front, warm

00:13:33.067 --> 00:13:38.133
front, stationary front, warm
front, cold front--

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:43.467
cold front, warm front,
cold front, warm

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:45.167
front, occluded front.

00:13:45.167 --> 00:13:50.533
So all the types of fronts are
shown in this little cartoon.

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:50.933
Question?

00:13:50.933 --> 00:13:52.600
STUDENT: Is there a difference
between an occluded and a

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:52.700
stationary front?

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.567
PROFESSOR: Yeah, a stationary front is a

00:13:55.567 --> 00:14:01.600
definite cold-warm contrast,
but it's not moving.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.700
Whereas an occluded front is a
cold front and a warm front

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.200
that have come together.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.900
Therefore, you've got cold
air on both sides.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.200
And the warm air has
been lifted aloft.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.700
So there is a big difference.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.300
Notice that they are
drawn differently.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.000
This has the symbols on opposite
sides, where here the

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.667
symbols are on the same side.

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:21.800
So think about that.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.500
Maybe put a sketch in your
notebook for these four types

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.167
of fronts--

00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:29.100
cold front warm front,
stationary front,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:29.967
and occluded front.

00:14:29.967 --> 00:14:33.967
This is kind of the language
by which we describe

00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:36.867
mid-latitude frontal cyclones.

00:14:36.867 --> 00:14:42.367
So this is the big weather
producer throughout the fall,

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:44.900
winter, and spring months
in mid-latitudes.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.933
These things just come at
us, one after the other.

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:52.700
Generally they control the
cycle of weather in

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:53.900
mid-latitudes.

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.500
You'll have a couple
days of warm air

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.833
blowing from the South.

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:00.667
Some precipitation
will follow.

00:15:00.667 --> 00:15:03.133
Then you'll have a couple days
with cold air coming

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:05.467
down from the North.

00:15:05.467 --> 00:15:09.267
So imagine this whole thing
moving west to east while you

00:15:09.267 --> 00:15:10.300
are stationary.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:12.267
It's almost as if you are
moving in the other

00:15:12.267 --> 00:15:13.200
direction--

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:16.533
experiencing this, and then
this, and then this--

00:15:16.533 --> 00:15:18.200
as these things move over you.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.900
Unfortunately they're
not periodic.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.833
They don't happen with
great periodicity.

00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:25.500
So it becomes rather difficult
to predict the weather.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.267
But as you get into the cycle--
if you begin to watch

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:31.567
the weather every day, and
occasionally take a peek at a

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:34.600
weather map, you'll begin to
understand this cycle of

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.667
events that is coming at you
day after day, week after

00:15:37.667 --> 00:15:42.833
week, throughout the cool
season of the year.

00:15:45.767 --> 00:15:46.200
Yes?

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.100
STUDENT: How can you tell by
looking at it whether it's

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.300
mature or in the early stages?

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.933
PROFESSOR: Well, it's a little

00:15:52.933 --> 00:15:55.100
bit deeper, I guess.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.633
They've drawn that--

00:15:56.633 --> 00:15:59.100
I must admit that was kind
of a judgment call.

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.067
These two don't look
so very different.

00:16:01.067 --> 00:16:03.200
This one was occluded, though,
so I could see that this is in

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:03.833
the final--

00:16:03.833 --> 00:16:06.667
These, maybe it was a judgment
call as to whether this is

00:16:06.667 --> 00:16:07.567
more mature.

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:08.967
It just looked like they'd
drawn it a little

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:10.333
bit deeper, to me.

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:19.833
And as I've discussed when we
were talking about clouds,

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:23.000
from space these storms look
like giant commas.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.233
Then, once you see the comma,
you can try to figure out

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:30.833
where those fronts are.

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:33.067
The cold front is probably
down here.

00:16:35.733 --> 00:16:37.467
The center of the low pressure
is somewhere in here.

00:16:37.467 --> 00:16:40.000
It almost has an eye
in this case.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.700
Winds are going around
this direction.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.733
The cold air from Canada
is coming down in here.

00:16:44.733 --> 00:16:46.233
Warm air is blowing up there.

00:16:46.233 --> 00:16:51.733
The warm front might be back
in here without much of an

00:16:51.733 --> 00:16:52.400
occluded front.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.733
Or it might actually be this--

00:16:53.733 --> 00:16:56.933
I'm sorry, it might actually
be this, in which case this

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.500
would be occluded all
the way up there.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.233
So I can't tell for sure from
that diagram where the warm

00:17:02.233 --> 00:17:03.433
front and the occluded
front is.

00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:04.667
But it might be--

00:17:04.667 --> 00:17:05.967
I'm sure that's a cold front.

00:17:05.967 --> 00:17:09.167
But where the occlusion takes
place I'm not exactly sure.

00:17:09.167 --> 00:17:10.700
And the same thing over here.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.767
This is a different case
altogether, but notice how

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.900
similar they are--

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.067
low pressure center, probably
an occluded front

00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:19.867
through here somewhere.

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:21.667
And then these fronts
will split apart.

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:25.333
You'll have the warm front
and the cold front.

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:28.000
The cold air, when it comes
down from Canada--

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.667
notice how clear the sky is--

00:17:29.667 --> 00:17:33.467
when it comes over the ocean,
that will be cold air over

00:17:33.467 --> 00:17:34.500
warm ocean.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:37.933
And you'll get this
cumulus clouds

00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:39.067
building up over the ocean.

00:17:39.067 --> 00:17:42.067
Because you've suddenly heated
that air from below,

00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:45.700
destabilizing the lapse rate,
causing convection, and

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.600
causing cumulus clouds
to form.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.300
These aren't precipitating.

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.200
These are precipitating.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.400
These are just cumulus clouds
out over the ocean.

00:17:57.467 --> 00:17:58.700
Questions?

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.667
So these are storms, and we
need to know what they do.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:08.133
To a large extent they are
beneficial because they bring

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:09.967
us the rain that we need.

00:18:09.967 --> 00:18:12.667
And the snow up in the mountains
that will then melt

00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:17.533
in the spring and summer and
give us water in the rivers.

00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:22.933
But, on the other hand, they can
also bring damaging winds.

00:18:22.933 --> 00:18:25.200
Especially on the--

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.133
I'll tell you where the strong
winds usually occur.

00:18:28.133 --> 00:18:30.500
Sometimes you get strong winds
in the warm sector, but

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.100
usually the strongest winds
are back here, behind the

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:41.300
cyclone, coming down from the
Northwest. And of course the

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.767
rain, while it's needed, can
sometimes be very heavy.

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:48.633
Or the snow can be very heavy,
which can cause flooding or

00:18:48.633 --> 00:18:52.900
deep, impenetrable
snow drifts.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.567
Because these storms do bring
cold air down from the north,

00:18:57.567 --> 00:19:01.667
often they can cause very severe
wind chill episodes,

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:06.333
with strong wind, sub-zero
temperatures, and quite

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:11.067
dangerous to be out in, in
this kind of a storm.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:16.967
And then over the ocean, those
strong winds mentioned here,

00:19:16.967 --> 00:19:20.533
winds passing over the ocean
generate ocean waves.

00:19:20.533 --> 00:19:23.467
The stronger the winds,
the bigger the waves.

00:19:23.467 --> 00:19:28.067
And they can be quite damaging
to ships at sea.

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:34.800
So these things have benefits
but also dangers.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:38.600
I'll talk about a few of the
famous ones in just a minute.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.000
Meteorologists like to
put names on things.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.167
I think every field likes
to put names on things.

00:19:45.167 --> 00:19:51.000
These are four typical storm
tracks, directions where

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.800
mid-latitude frontal cyclones
tend to move fairly

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.600
frequently.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.333
Ones that come in off the west
coast that were generated in

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:02.367
the vicinity of Hawaii are
sometimes referred to

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:05.867
meteorologists as the
Pineapple Express.

00:20:05.867 --> 00:20:08.733
Fun to use terms like that.

00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:12.233
Ones that come down from Canada
are generated up in

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:14.800
here and then come down towards
the Midwest are often

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.600
referred to as Alberta
Clippers.

00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:24.400
We get a lot of storms in the
west that were generated just

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.100
east of the Rocky Mountains.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.133
We call those Rocky Mountain
Storms because

00:20:28.133 --> 00:20:29.967
of where they generated.

00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:33.500
But the most famous one from New
England that you may have

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.633
heard about is the Nor'easter.

00:20:35.633 --> 00:20:37.300
How many have heard that
term Nor'easter?

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:37.733
All of you.

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:42.533
So this is just another
mid-latitude cyclone--

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:43.367
frontal cyclone--

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:45.933
but it's called a Nor'easter.

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:50.133
And its characteristic is that
it's normally generated in the

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:55.533
northern part of the Gulf of
Mexico, or more typically here

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:58.333
along the coast, the East Coast
of the United States.

00:20:58.333 --> 00:21:04.700
And then it moves up to New
England from the South.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.167
Anybody know why they're
called Nor'easters?

00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:10.933
STUDENT: They travel
northeast?

00:21:10.933 --> 00:21:11.200
PROFESSOR: Well, okay.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.200
One answer is that they're
traveling northeast. But

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.067
remember, this is a
traditional term.

00:21:16.067 --> 00:21:20.733
This term goes back 200 or 300
years before the motion of

00:21:20.733 --> 00:21:23.300
these storms was understood
by anybody.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.800
Right?

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.467
Wind from the northeast. So
if you are a New England

00:21:27.467 --> 00:21:29.767
fishermen or a farmer--

00:21:29.767 --> 00:21:31.133
especially a fisherman--

00:21:31.133 --> 00:21:34.067
and you're fishing offshore
here, and the wind begins to

00:21:34.067 --> 00:21:38.433
pick up from the northeast,
that is a sign

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:39.933
that a storm is coming.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:44.200
And you would quickly head back
to a sheltered cove or

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.433
back to land to get your
ship out of the storm.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:51.167
So a Nor'easter is named
Nor'easter because the first

00:21:51.167 --> 00:21:55.100
sign of it in New England
is the development of a

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:58.533
northeasterly wind, an
incoming-- wind coming in from

00:21:58.533 --> 00:22:01.800
the northeast. Now why
is that unusual?

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.667
Why would you notice that?

00:22:02.667 --> 00:22:06.167
Well, you're in the belt
of westerlies here.

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:08.700
So the winds are normally coming
from west to east. So

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.700
when a wind begins to go from
the northeast, well that's a

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:12.300
little bit different.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.300
And why is that a sign
of a storm to come?

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:19.567
Well, if a cyclone is coming
at you from the South--

00:22:19.567 --> 00:22:22.533
remember the winds are coming
around it this way--

00:22:22.533 --> 00:22:26.000
and so the first sign of it
you will feel as it moves

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.267
towards you is that
easterly wind.

00:22:28.267 --> 00:22:30.800
You add a little bit of friction
into that, and it's

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.033
going to be a northeasterly
wind.

00:22:33.033 --> 00:22:37.333
So the term Nor'easter comes
from the wind direction that

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:43.600
is the first indication that
this storm is approaching you.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.833
Is that clear?

00:22:49.633 --> 00:22:51.333
OK, Nor'easter--

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:53.467
frontal cyclone approaching New
England from the South,

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:55.067
first sign is the strengthening
wind from the

00:22:55.067 --> 00:22:58.133
northeast. There've been
a lot of famous ones.

00:22:58.133 --> 00:22:59.900
I've just listed a few.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.167
There was a big blizzard in New
England in 1888 that was

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:06.300
the Storm of the Century type
thing that you can Google and

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.500
find out about it.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.333
Soon after I moved to
New Haven in 1978

00:23:10.333 --> 00:23:12.667
there was a big blizzard.

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:14.833
I remember we slept in our
offices because we couldn't

00:23:14.833 --> 00:23:15.600
get home that night.

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:18.433
There were drifting snow.

00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:21.200
And then recently there've been
some, not quite as strong

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.000
or as famous.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.033
But there's been some
other Nor'easters.

00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:27.933
And here's a typical
satellite image.

00:23:27.933 --> 00:23:29.500
And Florida is covered here.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.700
But generally this is the East
Coast of the United States.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.233
And there's a big cyclone with
a cold front, the occluded

00:23:35.233 --> 00:23:37.367
front, the warm front
back into here.

00:23:37.367 --> 00:23:41.200
And that storm is moving up the
coast from south to north

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.767
bringing all those different
types of damages--

00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:46.733
the winds, the heavy rains--

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:51.933
further up north, heavy snow,
maybe even some freezing rain

00:23:51.933 --> 00:23:55.533
up in the Northeast. So all
these different local things

00:23:55.533 --> 00:23:56.033
can happen.

00:23:56.033 --> 00:23:56.333
Yes?

00:23:56.333 --> 00:24:01.100
STUDENT: How do the winds come
from the northeast if the

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.000
frontal-- if the front is
coming from the South?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.400
PROFESSOR: OK, lights on for a second here.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.533
If I've got-- here's Florida,
Cape Hatteras, Cape Cod, Long

00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:20.833
Island, New Haven.

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:25.967
So there's a low pressure
center here, let's say.

00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:29.767
Above the boundary layer where
there's no friction, the

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:32.333
isobars are going
to be like this.

00:24:32.333 --> 00:24:35.733
And the winds are going to be
traveling right around like

00:24:35.733 --> 00:24:39.500
that, paralleling the isobars.

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:42.500
Down in the frictional boundary
layer, where the

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.967
winds aren't quite geostrophic,
there's a little

00:24:44.967 --> 00:24:45.800
bit of a turning.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.033
They tend to move in, still
generally going parallel to

00:24:49.033 --> 00:24:50.967
the isobars but with
a little bit of

00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.733
cross-isobar flow as well.

00:24:54.733 --> 00:24:57.200
So here you've got some
northeasterly winds.

00:24:59.767 --> 00:25:03.533
Now as this storm moves up in
this direction, this pattern

00:25:03.533 --> 00:25:05.067
just translates.

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:08.500
And so the first thing a
fisherman up here feels is the

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.067
wind blowing from the northeast,
which is a sign

00:25:11.067 --> 00:25:11.733
that that's--

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:13.433
so it's not the fronts that
I'm talking about.

00:25:13.433 --> 00:25:18.233
It's the winds around that low
pressure center that gives

00:25:18.233 --> 00:25:21.000
rise to the northeasterly winds
as the first sign that

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.233
this thing is approaching,
as it moves up the

00:25:23.233 --> 00:25:24.500
coast. Does that help?

00:25:28.133 --> 00:25:29.367
Other questions on this?

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:40.267
So, a lot of famous storms.
The wreck of the Edmund

00:25:40.267 --> 00:25:45.800
Fitzgerald was a big tanker
ship in the Great Lakes.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:48.067
And along came a frontal
cyclone--

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:49.467
you see it drawn here--

00:25:49.467 --> 00:25:53.833
back in 1975, developed waves
so great on the Great Lakes

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:58.300
that this ship broke
apart and sank.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.933
Quite a thing at the time.

00:26:01.933 --> 00:26:03.900
Has anybody ever heard
the song about

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.667
that by Gordon Lightfoot?

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:07.767
Google it.

00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:08.467
Listen to that song.

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:09.133
It's a great song.

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:14.867
It coincided with kind of the
folk music era as well.

00:26:14.867 --> 00:26:18.400
And so this song became quite
well known, describing this

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.933
disaster but also fitting
into the genre of folk

00:26:22.933 --> 00:26:23.933
music at the time.

00:26:23.933 --> 00:26:27.100
So very strong frontal cyclone
generating waves

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.867
on the Great Lakes.

00:26:29.867 --> 00:26:31.400
The blizzard of 1978--

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.867
the one I mentioned,
here in New Haven--

00:26:33.867 --> 00:26:35.867
here's a satellite
image of it.

00:26:35.867 --> 00:26:39.433
Now what you're seeing here,
remember, are just the cumulus

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:42.400
clouds as the cold air behind
the cyclone comes

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.233
out over the ocean.

00:26:43.233 --> 00:26:45.700
But these are the fronts
back here.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:48.200
And very strong winds connected
with that, and a lot

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.733
of snowfall.

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:54.500
And this is what the highways
look like the next morning

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.733
after the blizzard
passed away.

00:26:57.733 --> 00:27:03.300
And then, have you heard
of The Perfect Storm?

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:07.267
This book by Sebastian Junger
became quite a best seller

00:27:07.267 --> 00:27:11.300
describing a storm that hit
the Grand Banks and sank a

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.267
fisher boat, the Andrea Gail.

00:27:14.267 --> 00:27:15.667
And here's a picture
of that storm.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:16.933
And notice it looks
like the others.

00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:19.300
You've got the cold front, the
warm front, the occluded

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.300
front, the cyclone, strong
winds, and so on, producing

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.867
big waves and sunk
that little--

00:27:24.867 --> 00:27:30.133
So you can read about that
in Junger's book.

00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:31.467
Now you get the same
thing in the

00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:33.733
Southern Hemisphere, remember.

00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:38.100
In Southern Hemisphere winter
you get a big north-south

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.600
temperature gradient.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.667
And you get the mid-latitude
frontal cyclones.

00:27:43.667 --> 00:27:45.233
They rotate in the opposite
direction.

00:27:45.233 --> 00:27:49.933
Just like hurricanes rotate
oppositely in the Southern

00:27:49.933 --> 00:27:54.533
Hemisphere, so do mid-latitude
frontal cyclones.

00:27:54.533 --> 00:28:00.700
They are-- the winds spin
clockwise around frontal

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.367
cyclones in the Southern
Hemisphere.

00:28:03.367 --> 00:28:06.433
And they are very strong down
there, perhaps even stronger

00:28:06.433 --> 00:28:09.133
than in the Northern Hemisphere,
which has given

00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:14.167
rise to these amusing terms
for these latitude belts,

00:28:14.167 --> 00:28:15.467
which you may have heard--

00:28:15.467 --> 00:28:18.667
the Roaring Forties, the
Furious Fifties.

00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:23.600
And even I've heard the term
Screaming Sixties used,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.800
referring to these latitude
belts where you get very

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:31.200
intense and frequent
mid-latitude frontal cyclones.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:36.800
And if you're sailing on a
clipper ship 150 years ago,

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.133
out of England, trying
to reach somewhere--

00:28:39.133 --> 00:28:43.733
First of all, remember that the
way you would do that--

00:28:43.733 --> 00:28:47.000
the winds down here are
westerlies, just as they are

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.933
in the Northern Hemisphere
mid-latitudes.

00:28:48.933 --> 00:28:52.800
So if you wanted to go to
Australia you'd come down here

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:57.500
and then go east. And then if
you wanted to return to

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.533
England you wouldn't try to
go back against these.

00:29:00.533 --> 00:29:03.433
You'd go further east. And you'd
come this way and then

00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:04.467
come back around.

00:29:04.467 --> 00:29:08.633
So here we have to go around
the Cape of Good Hope.

00:29:08.633 --> 00:29:10.267
Here you've got to go
around Cape Horn.

00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:14.900
And especially Cape Horn is
famous for all the shipwrecks

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.633
that have occurred as ships
have tried to go around or

00:29:17.633 --> 00:29:22.467
through this belt of very
intense and frequent

00:29:22.467 --> 00:29:24.400
mid-latitude frontal cyclones.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.200
So it's a very dangerous part of
the world ocean in which to

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.000
travel unless you've
got a big ship.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.900
I've crossed that passage
a couple times.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.800
And once or twice it's been
fairly calm, and other times

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.033
it's been anything but.

00:29:41.967 --> 00:29:44.867
Well, that's what I was going to
say about frontal cyclones.

00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:47.100
Again, it's not as detailed as
what the book goes into.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.667
But are there any questions
at this

00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:50.567
point on frontal cyclones?

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.933
Weather forecasting--

00:29:57.933 --> 00:29:59.900
This is not a course in
weather forecasting.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:03.900
You could take a whole
course in this.

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:06.900
But I want to say a few words
about how one forecasts all

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.800
these different types of
storms, especially the

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.933
mid-latitude frontal cyclones.

00:30:12.933 --> 00:30:18.100
It's pretty simple but it's
a big enterprise.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.500
The way you do it is first
describe the initial state of

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.200
the atmosphere--

00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.667
that is, temperature, pressure,
wind, humidity--

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:32.333
everywhere, globally and
vertically, at one time.

00:30:32.333 --> 00:30:35.867
You use weather balloons for
that, surface stations, and

00:30:35.867 --> 00:30:40.933
satellites to get that state of
the atmosphere described.

00:30:40.933 --> 00:30:44.833
Then you can use that as the
initial condition on a giant

00:30:44.833 --> 00:30:48.133
integration of the equations
of motion.

00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:51.300
These complicated equations,
which you have seen simplified

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:53.267
versions of in this course--

00:30:53.267 --> 00:30:58.233
like the perfect gas law, the
hydrostatic equation, cloud

00:30:58.233 --> 00:31:00.267
processes, and so on-- are all

00:31:00.267 --> 00:31:01.833
programmed into these equations.

00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:03.500
And then they're integrated
forward.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.133
This is a huge job and usually
the largest supercomputers

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:11.633
that exist in the world are
dedicated to this problem.

00:31:11.633 --> 00:31:14.800
There are a few other defense
applications that also have

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.533
some of the world's biggest
supercomputers.

00:31:16.533 --> 00:31:19.467
But for the most part,
meteorology has led the way in

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:22.200
the use of the biggest computer
you could get,

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.933
because it's a giant problem to
compute forward in time the

00:31:26.933 --> 00:31:29.200
weather processes all
around the globe.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:32.767
It all has to be done
simultaneously.

00:31:32.767 --> 00:31:34.933
In this country it's the
National Weather Service that

00:31:34.933 --> 00:31:36.233
does all of that--

00:31:36.233 --> 00:31:38.833
collects the data and puts them
into the equation and

00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:42.300
runs-- puts them into the
computer and integrates those

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.800
equations forward.

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.233
And you get your forecasts
directly from the Weather

00:31:46.233 --> 00:31:49.167
Service if you want, but then
there's a big private-sector

00:31:49.167 --> 00:31:53.033
industry that lies
on top of that.

00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:59.233
They get the raw results from
the computer output and then

00:31:59.233 --> 00:32:03.400
process it to make it useful
for the consumer.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.767
They make pretty graphics,
nice maps, predictions of

00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:10.267
what's going to happen hour by
hour, build nice websites.

00:32:10.267 --> 00:32:12.367
You know some of the companies
that do this.

00:32:12.367 --> 00:32:14.367
The Weather Channel
is such a company.

00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:16.933
There's a company called
AccuWeather that does this

00:32:16.933 --> 00:32:17.800
sort of thing.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.500
There's a half a dozen others.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.100
They don't do any of this
work themselves.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.600
So, actually, it's a pretty
sweet deal for these companies

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.267
because the government does
all the hard work.

00:32:28.267 --> 00:32:31.767
And all they do is kind of
pretty up the forecast, make

00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:35.133
it more useful for you and
I, and then sell it to a

00:32:35.133 --> 00:32:36.067
television station.

00:32:36.067 --> 00:32:39.633
Or sell it to us, or whatever,
in a nice useful form.

00:32:39.633 --> 00:32:41.467
And then that whole process
is repeated

00:32:41.467 --> 00:32:43.067
every 12 hours, right?

00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:45.633
That's why those balloons
go up every 12 hours.

00:32:45.633 --> 00:32:49.300
That's the start of the
next forecast cycle.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.600
So that's basically the way
the forecast system works.

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:59.433
People are always complaining
about the--

00:32:59.433 --> 00:33:02.400
that's one of the burdens
of being an atmospheric

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.067
scientist. You sit down
to somebody--

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:06.300
pick somebody on a bus and,
before you know it, they're

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.533
complaining about how bad the
weather forecasts are.

00:33:08.533 --> 00:33:11.533
You get a little bit tired of
hearing that, because they're

00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:13.400
actually-- for some purposes,
they're not that bad.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:15.533
They're pretty good.

00:33:15.533 --> 00:33:21.367
Now here's a diagram put out
by the National Weather

00:33:21.367 --> 00:33:23.667
Service, so it may be
a little bit biased.

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.700
But, no, it's very
statistical.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.233
They define a skill score.

00:33:29.233 --> 00:33:32.467
I don't have the mathematical
form of that to give you, but

00:33:32.467 --> 00:33:35.267
it's some kind of a measure of
the quality of the forecast--

00:33:35.267 --> 00:33:37.833
how accurate the forecast
was, compared to

00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:40.900
what actually happened.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.700
And it's plotted on a
scale from 0 to 80.

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.800
But 100 would be a
perfect forecast,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.667
perfect in all respects.

00:33:49.667 --> 00:33:56.833
This happens to be a forecast
for the 500 millibar level.

00:33:56.833 --> 00:33:58.900
So it's not every aspect of
the weather that's being

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.700
presented here, just the shape
of the isobaric patterns at

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.100
500 millibars.

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.133
And starts in 1955 when weather
forecasting first

00:34:10.133 --> 00:34:13.733
began, using computers,
and goes up to

00:34:13.733 --> 00:34:17.100
almost the present day.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:20.667
Let's follow the blue curve,
which is a 36-hour forecast.

00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:23.767
So this is the skill of
predicting the weather a day

00:34:23.767 --> 00:34:26.967
and a half in advance--

00:34:26.967 --> 00:34:28.967
telling the future,
if you like.

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:32.200
What's the weather going
to be 36 hours ahead?

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:35.267
The skill score was, like, 24
when I first started, and

00:34:35.267 --> 00:34:39.300
today it's something like 78.

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.700
Again, I haven't giving you
the formula by which that

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:43.400
statistical measure
is derived.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.867
But that's a pretty good
improvement over the time.

00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:48.667
It's caused by two things,
improvements in the numerical

00:34:48.667 --> 00:34:54.167
models and improvements in
measuring that initial state.

00:34:54.167 --> 00:34:55.467
Both things are very
important.

00:34:55.467 --> 00:34:57.700
You've got to measure the
initial state better, and

00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.067
you've got to have a more
accurate model with higher

00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:03.567
spatial resolution, too.

00:35:03.567 --> 00:35:07.967
Now if you try to do a
72-hour forecast--

00:35:07.967 --> 00:35:10.067
a three-day forecast--

00:35:10.067 --> 00:35:13.267
of course, your skill is
going to be lower.

00:35:13.267 --> 00:35:15.733
The further out you go in the
forecast the worse is going to

00:35:15.733 --> 00:35:18.133
be the quality of your forecast.
But that, too, has

00:35:18.133 --> 00:35:19.367
been improving.

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:24.900
So today the 72-hour forecast is
about as good as a 36-hour

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:28.433
forecast was in the
early '80s.

00:35:28.433 --> 00:35:30.067
So we're definitely making
progress on this.

00:35:30.067 --> 00:35:33.033
And of course, people are trying
to compute out still

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.600
further in time.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:36.767
If you go into the Weather
Channel you'll find forecasts

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.933
out seven, eight, even
nine days in advance.

00:35:39.933 --> 00:35:41.800
I don't usually trust those.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.467
But they're fun to look at and
speculate about what might be.

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:47.700
Questions on this?

00:35:50.267 --> 00:35:52.667
So for example, I've shown
you some of these.

00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:57.133
This is a 500 millibar map
from a couple days ago.

00:35:57.133 --> 00:36:00.833
It's this that they're basing
that skill score on.

00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:02.967
Now that's a problem, because
you or I might be more

00:36:02.967 --> 00:36:06.367
interested in whether it's
going to rain or not.

00:36:06.367 --> 00:36:08.767
But that's not what that
particular skill score-- there

00:36:08.767 --> 00:36:09.767
are others that measure that.

00:36:09.767 --> 00:36:13.133
But that particular skill score
was just whether the

00:36:13.133 --> 00:36:15.967
correct prediction was made
for the shape of those

00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:19.267
isobaric disturbances
at 500 millibars.

00:36:19.267 --> 00:36:23.133
So I don't mean to claim that
that measure of skill is

00:36:23.133 --> 00:36:24.100
all-encompassing.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:29.300
It just measures one aspect
of weather forecasting.

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:35.533
So here's my off-the-cuff
summary about how well we're

00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:39.100
doing with various types
of storms. With severe

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.667
thunderstorms we predict the
probability pretty well.

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:45.667
In other words, you'll hear a
forecast saying something like

00:36:45.667 --> 00:36:50.233
80% chance of thunderstorms
tomorrow afternoon.

00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:52.600
We do that pretty well.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:56.100
But in terms of predicting when
and where an individual

00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:00.233
storm is going to occur, we have
almost no skill at that.

00:37:00.233 --> 00:37:02.567
We don't know whether it's going
to occur over Hartford

00:37:02.567 --> 00:37:06.800
or Stamford.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.500
We just can't do that kind of
local forecasting with this

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.433
kind of storm because they're
too chaotic, they're too

00:37:12.433 --> 00:37:14.367
random, in what triggers them.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.733
Hurricanes-- oh and the
tornadoes which come out of

00:37:18.733 --> 00:37:22.200
those, we're very poor at
predicting when and where a

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:23.767
tornado will arise.

00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:25.667
So we use what's called
nowcasting.

00:37:25.667 --> 00:37:29.467
It's a funny term, almost
a metaphor for failure.

00:37:29.467 --> 00:37:33.400
But nowcasting means--

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.400
as I showed you in the film the
other day-- nowcasting is

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:42.967
seeing the thing and then
saying, watch out, it's there.

00:37:42.967 --> 00:37:44.800
And also-- it's not quite that
bad, because you could see it

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:46.800
and see what direction
it's moving.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.133
So you could give a few
minutes' warning to a

00:37:50.133 --> 00:37:52.733
community where that tornado
was approaching.

00:37:52.733 --> 00:37:55.933
But in terms of being able to
predict something like that

00:37:55.933 --> 00:37:57.933
from a numerical model, no.

00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:00.500
We have no skill at being able
to predict from first

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:05.667
principles when and where
a tornado will occur.

00:38:05.667 --> 00:38:11.200
Moving onto hurricanes, genesis
means when you first

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.400
create the hurricane.

00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:15.200
We're very poor at that.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.600
Once the hurricane is formed,
we're quite good at predicting

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.267
where its track is
going to be.

00:38:22.267 --> 00:38:24.233
For example, Hurricane Irene
was a good example of that.

00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:26.667
They really had that track
nailed, even out three or four

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:27.833
days in advance.

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:32.967
They had a very good track
forecast. As it changes its

00:38:32.967 --> 00:38:35.000
strength however as it moves
along its track it may weaken

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.267
or strengthen.

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:38.767
We're not very good at that.

00:38:38.767 --> 00:38:40.200
So certain things we do well.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.733
Frontal cyclones we're
pretty good at.

00:38:41.733 --> 00:38:44.400
These wintertime storms
we often have good

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.767
skill out to five days.

00:38:46.767 --> 00:38:50.733
Occasionally we have a real
bust. The weather service will

00:38:50.733 --> 00:38:55.433
fail to predict the big storm
genesis event or will forecast

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.700
one that didn't occur.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:00.767
But those busts are
increasingly rare.

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:04.733
And I'm amazed sometimes at how
skillful the prediction of

00:39:04.733 --> 00:39:07.967
these storms can be, out even
several days in advance.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.867
Questions there?

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.300
Now we won't finish this today,
but I want you to start

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.667
being aware of forecasts.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.900
I usually go to this page.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.300
You can click to it
on my website.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.567
It's the NCAR real-time
weather data.

00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:36.267
And for example, right
now you could--

00:39:36.267 --> 00:39:42.233
well let's look at the upper
air data from 500 millibar

00:39:42.233 --> 00:39:45.067
sounding for this morning.

00:39:45.067 --> 00:39:47.567
This is the 12Z Friday
sounding.

00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:50.433
You see the date and
time up there.

00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:51.467
This is what the
weather's doing

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:53.067
right now at 500 millibars.

00:39:53.067 --> 00:39:58.533
There's a big trough in the west
coast, a big ridge on the

00:39:58.533 --> 00:40:01.900
east coast, and then another
cyclone moving away to the

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.633
east. This would be the
starting point for

00:40:06.633 --> 00:40:10.300
integrations forward in time.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.900
And then if we go back,
we can see what the

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.667
forecast is going to be.

00:40:14.667 --> 00:40:16.600
I'll click on the forecast
tab up here.

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:23.867
First of all, we could look--
here's the 12-hour forecast.

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:32.067
So this is valid, yeah,
18 UTC Friday.

00:40:32.067 --> 00:40:39.033
So that's going to be valid in
about three hours from now.

00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:43.767
And there's a nicely developed
mid-latitude frontal cyclone

00:40:43.767 --> 00:40:50.367
down here, cold front,
stationary front.

00:40:53.533 --> 00:40:54.767
Let's go forward in time.

00:41:01.767 --> 00:41:04.700
Let's go 36 hours in advance.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.033
This is valid 12Z Saturday,
so this is tomorrow

00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:11.200
morning at 8:00 AM.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.500
You see what they're
forecasting.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.967
The green gives you moisture
and precipitation.

00:41:14.967 --> 00:41:17.900
The lows and the fronts
are all there.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.600
So what about your New
Haven weekend?

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.833
It's not my job to give you an
indication of the forecast.

00:41:25.833 --> 00:41:27.867
But anyway, it's going to be
a nice weekend, right?

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:30.567
We've got a high pressure
center over us.

00:41:30.567 --> 00:41:33.467
High pressure centers
have descending air,

00:41:33.467 --> 00:41:35.300
cleans out the clouds.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:38.233
Should be very nice
for the weekend.

00:41:38.233 --> 00:41:40.033
And let's think about
what's going to

00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:41.733
happen after that, however.

00:41:41.733 --> 00:41:44.333
For now I'm going to
go to an animation.

00:41:44.333 --> 00:41:46.567
I think I want to
animate this.

00:41:46.567 --> 00:41:48.433
Loop all times.

00:41:48.433 --> 00:41:54.000
We'll go to something like the
500 millibar winds, and we'll

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.967
see if that's going to loop.

00:41:55.967 --> 00:41:58.667
Why isn't that looping?

00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:00.100
I didn't hit the loop there?

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.200
Is that what I didn't do?

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.733
OK, so these are the forecasts
now, done from the recent

00:42:07.733 --> 00:42:10.233
balloon sounding as the
initial condition.

00:42:10.233 --> 00:42:13.933
And you see that it's a
very well developed

00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:15.967
trough ridge system.

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:18.933
And generally the whole thing
is creeping eastward.

00:42:18.933 --> 00:42:21.767
Now this doesn't go very
far forward in time.

00:42:21.767 --> 00:42:23.733
In fact, I don't know why.

00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:26.367
Did I not click on the
right thing here?

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.067
Loop all times.

00:42:31.067 --> 00:42:34.433
Yeah, well it's only giving me
a 12-hour forecast, which is

00:42:34.433 --> 00:42:35.200
not what I want.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.300
So let me try a different
model.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.233
Yeah, OK.

00:42:38.233 --> 00:42:39.833
This one goes-- this will
be a different model.

00:42:46.867 --> 00:42:51.300
Saturday, Sunday, still good
weather over New Haven.

00:42:55.733 --> 00:42:58.467
So remember now, this is
a computer integration.

00:42:58.467 --> 00:43:00.767
This takes the balloon sounding
satellite data for

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:04.533
last Friday, for today, and then
integrates it forward in

00:43:04.533 --> 00:43:08.633
time to get the forecast. And it
may not be accurate towards

00:43:08.633 --> 00:43:11.267
the end of the time period, but
it's probably pretty good

00:43:11.267 --> 00:43:12.367
for the next couple days.

00:43:12.367 --> 00:43:13.033
We're out of time.

00:43:13.033 --> 00:43:14.767
We'll continue this on Monday.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.524
Prof: Now I have--to--I
must tell you that I have very

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:06.970
bad news for you.
 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.460
It has nothing to do with the
exams.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.772
It's that I've been talking
with my economist friends and

00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:18.700
what they tell me is that you
are inferior goods.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.673
They even tell me that Yale
students are probably among the

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:26.160
most inferior of all goods.
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.805
Of course, I put on my
naÃ”ve face and said,

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:32.210
'What are you talking about?'
 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.800
and this is what I learned.
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:48.565
You take--I hope I've learned
to bring my--This is a standard

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:54.990
economics kind of diagram.
 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.902
What it shows is the amount of
clothing that an individual

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:01.630
buys.
 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.450
If they're very poor,
they buy at the Salvation Army

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.796
Store and they spend a very
little bit or they buy very few

00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:10.769
clothing.
 

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:14.441
When they get rich they go to
Brooks Brothers and buy suits

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:18.177
for $1,000 and that's probably
an underestimate of what they

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:19.379
actually spend.
 

00:01:19.379 --> 00:01:22.656
As their income increases,
the amount that they spend,

00:01:22.656 --> 00:01:25.810
or the number of things that
they buy, increases.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.420
All a very standard kind of
thing.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.944
The ratio, there's an extra
little fillip to this,

00:01:33.944 --> 00:01:36.750
not wildly important for this
course.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.126
How much this line increases
for a particular change in

00:01:42.126 --> 00:01:48.200
income is called the elasticity,
how big a change there is.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.988
In clothing,
you really don't need an awful

00:01:51.988 --> 00:01:57.310
lot of clothing to put on,
but you can spend a lot on it.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.409
I know myself that when I was a
graduate student,

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.733
I used to buy all my clothing
at the Goodwill Store and now

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:07.114
that I'm a professor I have a
little more income and I don't

00:02:07.114 --> 00:02:09.348
buy so much at the Goodwill
Store,

00:02:09.348 --> 00:02:12.174
but it's still a great place to
buy things and I see the other

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.774
graduate--
the graduate students know

00:02:13.774 --> 00:02:15.060
exactly what I'm talking about.
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.147
Really, clothing has a big
elasticity, but food down here,

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:24.788
you know you really can't eat
that much more food.

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:29.658
We try, of course,
but we don't succeed.

00:02:29.658 --> 00:02:33.321
So no matter what your income
is, if you--certainly if you

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:37.240
measure the food in pounds you
don't eat an awful lot more.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.542
If you measure it in dollars
you can buy caviar and live on

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:48.027
caviar, but basically there can
be a high elasticity or a low

00:02:48.027 --> 00:02:49.400
elasticity.
 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.363
That's one of the clear and
simple ideas of economics and

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:55.840
I'm sure it's nothing new to
you.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.770
Now can you think of a counter
example to this?

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.969
Something that as people get
richer they buy less of.

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.090
Student:  Spam.
 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.849
Prof: What?
 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:06.879
Student:  Spam.
 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:07.909
Prof: Spam. Good.
 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.340
Cheap food.
 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.197
What's--that's a generation
ago, so how many of you have

00:03:13.197 --> 00:03:14.460
ever eaten Spam?
 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.979
You went to prep school or
something, right?

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.860
I have never eaten Spam,
but McDonald's hamburgers are

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.128
one of those kinds of things.
 

00:03:23.128 --> 00:03:26.860
For people in a poor country,
like rice.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.087
What do they go from--brown
rice, unpolished rice is what

00:03:31.087 --> 00:03:35.619
the poor people eat or in India
millet and then when they get

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:40.150
more money they go to polished
rice or they go to wheat.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.391
In all countries food is one of
the important things that you

00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:45.229
eat up higher on the food chain.
 

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.110
You change what you want to eat
depending on your income and you

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.699
can eat less of what you
previously did.

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:56.827
Public transportation is
another example of goods that

00:03:56.827 --> 00:04:00.310
you buy less of as you get
richer.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.140
If you get richer,
you take a taxi or you have

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.663
your own limousine and a
chauffeur and so forth if you're

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:07.860
really wealthy.
 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.280
All of these things do the
opposite thing to that.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.370
Economists have a word for that
kind of a good and it is?

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.139
Student:  Inferior.
 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.000
Prof: Inferior, good.
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.420
Now what's another example of
that?

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.740
You guys.
 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:31.879
One of the most robust
phenomenon in the world is this

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.689
fact.
 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:39.509
Poor people have a lot of kids,
rich people have very few kids.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.180
This works no matter how you
spin it.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.562
You can compare a poor country,
so take any Sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:46.562 --> 00:04:49.637
country that you want,
to a rich country take any

00:04:49.637 --> 00:04:52.144
European,
American, Japanese country that

00:04:52.144 --> 00:04:54.632
you like;
if this is income across

00:04:54.632 --> 00:04:57.565
countries, as they say
cross-sectional,

00:04:57.565 --> 00:04:59.649
this is very,
very true.

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.781
If you look within a country
like--pick any country,

00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:08.317
the rich people tend to have
fewer children than the poor

00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:09.209
people.
 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.100
Also you can spin it a third
way with time,

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.689
if you look at when a country
was poor,

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.769
they'll be having a lot of
children and then,

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:18.589
as they develop economically,
they get rich,

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:20.310
they have fewer children.
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.319
This is an absolutely robust
kind of data.

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.377
One of the--yeah--
Student:  What if you

00:05:28.377 --> 00:05:31.439
measured value of children by
investment per child?

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.889
Prof: We're going to get
to that later.

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.250
That's at the end of a lot of
intermediate stuff.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.192
This is the number of children
that you get,

00:05:41.192 --> 00:05:44.956
it's not how much you're
spending on them but the number

00:05:44.956 --> 00:05:47.009
of children that you have.
 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:52.742
You have these three different
ways, you can have a high slope,

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:56.346
a low slope,
and the slope can even turn

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:57.180
down.
 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:04.026
This is some real data
for--this is the total fertility

00:06:04.026 --> 00:06:08.338
rate and going from one,
or even less,

00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:12.302
up to eight children and this
is the gross domestic product

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:14.586
per adult,
and this is the log of it

00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:17.028
because it goes over six orders
of magnitude.

00:06:17.028 --> 00:06:22.399
That's--some places earn an
awful lot more so there's not a

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:25.269
linear scale but a log scale.
 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:29.160
Over that whole range you can
see some very good correlation.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.776
Those countries which have poor
income, have a lot of children,

00:06:34.776 --> 00:06:39.850
and those that have a lot of
income have few children.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.139
This is two different periods
in time,

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:46.699
1960 which is really before the
third world fertility transition

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.464
and 2000 when you're in the
middle of the third world

00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:55.170
fertility transition and you
have these points for the 1960--

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.512
the circles,
the pluses are for 2000 and you

00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:01.836
see there's--
what's happened is they've slid

00:07:01.836 --> 00:07:04.384
down this line,
the countries have slid down

00:07:04.384 --> 00:07:04.920
this line.
 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.076
They're still pretty much the
same relationship but the

00:07:10.076 --> 00:07:14.470
countries progress and their
income goes up.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.540
This is the regression line for
1960;

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.730
this is the regression line for
2000, a small difference.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.415
It's not--it hasn't changed
very much, so again this is

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:28.939
really a very robust kind of
thing.

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:34.845
If you compare countries a 10%
increase in per capita income

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:38.949
equates to a 13% decrease in
fertility.

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.545
It's a very interesting thing;
you have big culture

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.230
differences between countries.
 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.740
Within a country where you're
under,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.012
more or less,
if you have a homogeneous

00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:52.360
country,
more or less the same culture,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.180
the freedom of people to change
their fertility--

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.937
to control--to choose their
fertility is much more limited

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:00.189
within a culture.
 

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:04.168
Now if you look only within a
country you get a much smaller

00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:08.483
change, a 10% increase in income
correlates with only a 1% change

00:08:08.483 --> 00:08:09.629
in fertility.
 

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:12.529
So it depends exactly how you
run your statistics,

00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:15.607
how big an effect this is but
it's absolutely robust,

00:08:15.607 --> 00:08:16.910
we always find it.
 

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:22.136
Here's a great term paper for
you, or even a research paper

00:08:22.136 --> 00:08:24.839
for the summer or something.
 

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:27.939
It's usually--this is with
respect to the Yale students.

00:08:27.939 --> 00:08:30.309
It's usually presumed that the
families of Yale students

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:31.860
generally have a very good
income.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.943
Probably even within--I mean
Yale tries to get a distribution

00:08:34.943 --> 00:08:37.976
of incomes but within each class
we probably do very well so

00:08:37.976 --> 00:08:39.519
we're a high-income group.
 

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:42.379
It's probably also true that we
generally have very few

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:45.291
children, that your families
probably each have very few

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:45.980
children.
 

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.423
You can take a ratio of family
income to number of children and

00:08:50.423 --> 00:08:54.654
that ratio for different groups
is probably a measure of how

00:08:54.654 --> 00:08:56.158
inferior you are.
 

00:08:56.158 --> 00:09:01.559
The higher the ratio income to
number of children tells you how

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:06.610
much parents don't want children
because they have a lot of

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:07.570
income.
 

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.808
Guess who has this data?
 

00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:12.230
Where have you filled in this
data?

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.280
Admissions office;
if you applied for a

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.759
scholarship which I think at
least three-quarters of you

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:21.149
apparently do,
some sort of financial aid,

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:24.544
they have income data on your
family and they also have the

00:09:24.544 --> 00:09:26.769
number of siblings in your
family,

00:09:26.769 --> 00:09:28.720
all that is data that they have.
 

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.716
If you can get it out of
admissions you could really do

00:09:31.716 --> 00:09:34.878
some very interesting study of
what is that ratio for Yale

00:09:34.878 --> 00:09:35.600
students.
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.403
Then once it's published from
Yale, every other school in the

00:09:38.403 --> 00:09:41.111
country is going to try to do it
and it'll do for different

00:09:41.111 --> 00:09:41.580
works.
 

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.190
I haven't seen these kind of
things published,

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:49.740
that this ratio for various
special socioeconomic groups.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:58.177
This is kind of a surprising
phenomenon that rich people

00:09:58.177 --> 00:10:02.320
buy--have fewer children.
 

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.769
One year I taught this course
and there was a guy in it,

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:10.059
a somewhat older guy who was
actually already a professor in

00:10:10.059 --> 00:10:11.581
Kenya,
but he had come to Yale for

00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:13.320
more education and he took this
course.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.360
After the course he told me
that he was just blown away,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.210
that he had never realized,
coming from Kenya,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.168
that poor people had more
children then rich people.

00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:26.436
Actually he put it the other
way, he had no idea that one of

00:10:26.436 --> 00:10:29.870
the aspects of being rich was
that you have fewer children,

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.798
and he was a college professor
or a university professor in

00:10:33.798 --> 00:10:34.340
Kenya.
 

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.080
This is quite,
actually quite shocking.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:42.053
You heard, I mean our whole
cultural story is that parent's

00:10:42.053 --> 00:10:44.139
love children,
parents want children,

00:10:44.139 --> 00:10:46.812
well they want them,
maybe they love them--well not

00:10:46.812 --> 00:10:48.798
when they're teenagers of
course.

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:52.292
You would expect that more
income would be an enabling

00:10:52.292 --> 00:10:55.322
factor, a very big enabling
factor, that you'd,

00:10:55.322 --> 00:10:57.629
in general, have more children.
 

00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:58.830
But it isn't the case.
 

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.577
Well this is--anomalous things
are of great interest to

00:11:02.577 --> 00:11:05.345
scientists,
including social scientists,

00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:08.743
and so economists of course
have paid a good amount of

00:11:08.743 --> 00:11:10.090
attention to this.
 

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:13.658
The way they talk about
children is that they try to

00:11:13.658 --> 00:11:16.524
generalize,
just the way scientists try to

00:11:16.524 --> 00:11:19.068
generalize things,
make Newton's Laws apply to

00:11:19.068 --> 00:11:20.947
everything,
whereas before they were a lot

00:11:20.947 --> 00:11:23.806
of different things,
so they try to do use the same

00:11:23.806 --> 00:11:26.840
words they use for suits or food
for children.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.893
The kinds of things they say
are that children are "a

00:11:30.893 --> 00:11:35.989
time intensive commodity";
they take a lot of time to

00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:39.690
either enjoy or bring up
properly.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.409
Women's value of time is a key
component in "the price of

00:11:44.409 --> 00:11:47.969
children",
that children have a price like

00:11:47.969 --> 00:11:49.440
any other good.
 

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.360
The time--this is all quotes
out of various recent articles.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.952
The "time cost of children
and other household

00:11:56.952 --> 00:11:59.388
production",
children are one of the things

00:11:59.388 --> 00:12:00.840
that households produce.
 

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.986
Then they talk about the
opportunity costs for households

00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:08.320
to "produce and consume a
child".

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.769
I love the idea of what parents
are doing is consuming you.

00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:16.740
I will put on the web an
article by Jonathan Swift,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:20.394
the same guy who did
Gulliver's Travels,

00:12:20.394 --> 00:12:22.460
you know this article?
 

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.918
A Modest Proposal,
exactly;

00:12:24.918 --> 00:12:27.856
this is tongue in cheek on his
part but at that time,

00:12:27.856 --> 00:12:30.908
much earlier and much later,
the English were concerned

00:12:30.908 --> 00:12:32.490
about the Irish problem.
 

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.577
The Irish were very poor,
they had tons of kids,

00:12:35.577 --> 00:12:38.400
and they didn't like to be
ruled by England,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.158
so the Irish problem had to be
solved.

00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:44.570
What Swift suggested was that
the Irish eat their children.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.702
This would provide good food
for them, a lot of protein and

00:12:48.702 --> 00:12:49.629
everything.
 

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:53.857
So, it would solve their
starvation problem and it would

00:12:53.857 --> 00:12:56.779
reduce the population problem
there.

00:12:56.779 --> 00:12:58.950
Of course this was tongue in
cheek but it makes really

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.668
interesting reading and
especially his--

00:13:00.668 --> 00:13:03.460
notice his use of--if you
bother to read it,

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.240
it's not required,
his use of numbers.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.336
It's full of numbers;
it's a real takeoff on what

00:13:10.336 --> 00:13:17.102
fairly contemporaneous people,
like people starting to write

00:13:17.102 --> 00:13:20.200
economics, were writing.
 

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.634
This idea that economics deals
with children just as they do

00:13:24.634 --> 00:13:29.148
with any other commodity,
it's the genius of economics to

00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:32.273
be able to do that,
just as it's the genius of

00:13:32.273 --> 00:13:34.798
science to be able to make
generalizations.

00:13:34.798 --> 00:13:36.523
But it's also one of the
reasons people reject the

00:13:36.523 --> 00:13:36.908
approach.
 

00:13:36.908 --> 00:13:40.618
They just--people generally
don't want to consider

00:13:40.618 --> 00:13:42.509
themselves commodities.
 

00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:47.490
Why should people want fewer
children as they get richer?

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:51.118
Well the basis of essentially
all modern economics is rational

00:13:51.118 --> 00:13:54.038
actor theory,
that people act to maximize

00:13:54.038 --> 00:13:56.162
their happiness,
-- or utility,

00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:58.538
or preferences,
there's a lot of different

00:13:58.538 --> 00:14:01.440
jargon words with slightly
different meanings,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.980
-- and they don't act against
their self interests.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.688
Now there's new psychological
economics, or neural economics,

00:14:07.688 --> 00:14:11.089
which finds out this isn't
really true, but that doesn't

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:11.769
matter.
 

00:14:11.769 --> 00:14:15.629
Most theory depends on rational
actor theory.

00:14:15.629 --> 00:14:19.400
So economists believe that
people decide what to do,

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.250
based on a calculation.
 

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.500
It doesn't necessarily have to
be a conscious calculation,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.636
which is a little problem
there, of what's good for them

00:14:27.636 --> 00:14:29.120
and they act that way.
 

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.738
Somehow economists have to
figure out why is it good for

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:35.830
people who have money to have
fewer children?

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:37.460
Why is it in their self
interest?

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:44.710
Actually a guy wrote a paper,
Gary Becker in 1960,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.860
and then he got a Nobel Prize
for this,

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:51.855
for bringing family--what they
call family economics into the

00:14:51.855 --> 00:14:56.769
mainstream of economics and
treating children like any other

00:14:56.769 --> 00:14:57.519
good.
 

00:14:57.519 --> 00:15:02.076
Some of what I'm going to tell
you really comes from Becker's

00:15:02.076 --> 00:15:02.759
theory.
 

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:06.825
As I mentioned,
one of the fundamental ideas is

00:15:06.825 --> 00:15:10.360
that it costs money to rear
children,

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.470
and so they can be considered
an item to be purchased,

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:17.138
and so they call them a good,
anything that you purchase is

00:15:17.138 --> 00:15:18.149
called a good.
 

00:15:18.149 --> 00:15:21.965
There are different kinds of
goods and children are--all of

00:15:21.965 --> 00:15:24.070
them or at least most of them.
 

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:26.970
They're a production good like
a machine.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.081
A production good is something
you buy, like a machine for a

00:15:30.081 --> 00:15:31.190
factory to do work.
 

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:33.056
And children,
of course, especially in poor

00:15:33.056 --> 00:15:34.700
settings, do various kinds of
work.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.580
We'll come back to each of
these things.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.354
They are also a consumption
good, a consumption good is

00:15:39.354 --> 00:15:42.590
something that you buy and maybe
eventually use up but you enjoy

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:42.950
it.
 

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.452
You buy it because you get
pleasure in some sense out of

00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:49.509
having that, not because it does
work for you.

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:52.808
The third thing is,
they can be an investment good.

00:15:52.808 --> 00:15:55.947
You put money into a child when
they're young,

00:15:55.947 --> 00:16:00.129
and then when they're older you
get something back for it;

00:16:00.129 --> 00:16:02.760
a return just like putting
money in a bond,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.081
you put it in and then you wait
some time and you get,

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:07.710
presumably, more back.
 

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:11.909
First consider children as a
production good,

00:16:11.909 --> 00:16:16.778
which is very largely the case
in poor countries.

00:16:16.778 --> 00:16:22.692
One thing that's pretty obvious
is a child does not cost much to

00:16:22.692 --> 00:16:24.798
make;
it's pretty cheap.

00:16:24.798 --> 00:16:29.538
In a peasant family children do
a lot of work for the family.

00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:31.960
They can run errands,
they collect firewood,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.513
they can fetch water,
they take care of younger

00:16:34.513 --> 00:16:36.514
children,
they weed the fields,

00:16:36.514 --> 00:16:40.009
there's a whole bunch of things
that children will do.

00:16:40.009 --> 00:16:44.269
You have some readings on that
in today's readings.

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:48.058
They actually do a lot of work.
 

00:16:48.058 --> 00:16:52.120
Here's an example,
"little Baz,"

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.572
the name of a kid,
"can run all over,

00:16:55.572 --> 00:16:57.960
fetch up cows out of the stock
fields,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.950
or oxen, carry in stove wood
and climb in the corn crib and

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.638
feed the hogs,
and go on errands down at his

00:17:04.638 --> 00:17:05.528
grandma's."
 

00:17:05.528 --> 00:17:08.730
Guess where that description
comes from?

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.343
Could be anywhere in the world,
it happens to be a Kansas

00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:14.150
settler in the late 1800s.
 

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.791
In America, like other places,
in the farm economy kids do an

00:17:18.791 --> 00:17:20.338
awful lot of work.
 

00:17:20.338 --> 00:17:24.112
There's a saying from Indonesia
that, by age seven,

00:17:24.112 --> 00:17:28.789
a child does more work for the
family than the family has to do

00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:29.618
for it.
 

00:17:29.618 --> 00:17:32.190
To study that,
sociologists,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.474
anthropologists,
economists actually go out in

00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:40.950
the field and observe in peasant
societies.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:44.192
The professor or graduate
student stays with the family or

00:17:44.192 --> 00:17:46.236
stays very--
in the same village with the

00:17:46.236 --> 00:17:48.329
family and always carries around
a clipboard,

00:17:48.329 --> 00:17:49.608
one of these clipboards.
 

00:17:49.608 --> 00:17:52.016
What they do is,
they write down everything that

00:17:52.016 --> 00:17:55.241
the parents do for the children
and everything that the children

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.420
do for the parents.
 

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:01.568
Mom is cooking,
sister is washing vegetables,

00:18:01.568 --> 00:18:05.056
little brother is sent to the
neighbors for a bit of cooking

00:18:05.056 --> 00:18:07.801
oil,
baby just defecated,

00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.932
mom stops cooking to clean up
the baby, etc.,

00:18:12.932 --> 00:18:13.750
etc.
 

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.829
You can imagine all this down
on a clipboard.

00:18:15.829 --> 00:18:20.881
That's when a child is young;
the family puts a lot of work

00:18:20.881 --> 00:18:21.980
into the child.
 

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.757
As the child gets older they
require less and less from the

00:18:25.757 --> 00:18:29.338
family and they start doing more
work for the family.

00:18:29.338 --> 00:18:32.396
So economists--you can
calculate, or anthropologists,

00:18:32.396 --> 00:18:34.750
anybody can calculate a
crossover age.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:39.021
What is the age at which
children do more work for the

00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:43.779
family, measured say in hours,
than the family does work for

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:45.150
the children?
 

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:49.249
It's no longer quite as young
as the 7 that the Indonesians

00:18:49.249 --> 00:18:52.007
talked about,
but modern calculations show

00:18:52.007 --> 00:18:55.493
it's something like at age 13
children are doing more work in

00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:58.753
an agrarian society,
children are doing more work

00:18:58.753 --> 00:19:01.950
for the family than the family
puts in to them.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:08.338
In your reading packet is a
story about Tanamani,

00:19:08.338 --> 00:19:11.490
from Malaysia,
and every year students ask--

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.480
it's a wonderful story,
you'll love it,

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:17.190
why do I put that in?,
and of course it's child labor.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:20.086
It shows you what--how
exactly--a little bit unusual

00:19:20.086 --> 00:19:22.358
instance but how children are
viewed,

00:19:22.358 --> 00:19:24.498
it is not romantic at all,
it's a straight economic

00:19:24.498 --> 00:19:27.335
calculation,
you maximize the amount of work

00:19:27.335 --> 00:19:29.390
that you get out of a child.
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:33.480
Jonathan Swift I think mentions
age 6 as the age when children

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.632
can begin earning money as
pickpockets and David

00:19:36.632 --> 00:19:40.788
Copperfield was sent to work
apparently at the age of 10,

00:19:40.788 --> 00:19:44.358
and Charles Dickens himself
went to work at the age of 12.

00:19:44.358 --> 00:19:48.567
Currently calculations from the
United Nations International

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:52.491
Labor Organization shows that
there's something like 250

00:19:52.491 --> 00:19:56.628
million children aged 5 to 14
that are employed and half of

00:19:56.628 --> 00:19:59.838
these children are employed full
time,

00:19:59.838 --> 00:20:02.568
not as casual laborers but as
full time.

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:05.865
This estimate,
this is not a decreasing

00:20:05.865 --> 00:20:10.810
phenomenon but this estimate is
up from earlier ones of 73

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:15.499
million children,
so from 73 to 250 million,

00:20:15.499 --> 00:20:21.378
child labor is apparently
increasing quite significantly

00:20:21.378 --> 00:20:23.088
in the world.
 

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:26.575
Agrarian societies,
just from the work that

00:20:26.575 --> 00:20:29.404
children do,
children can be an economic

00:20:29.404 --> 00:20:33.279
benefit and so people want a lot
of them to work around the farm.

00:20:33.279 --> 00:20:37.750
Even in the early stages of
industrialization children are

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.457
often sent into earning work
where they earn cash and in real

00:20:42.457 --> 00:20:45.878
poverty situations,
in industrially developing

00:20:45.878 --> 00:20:48.248
countries,
even the small wages of

00:20:48.248 --> 00:20:52.503
children can make a sort of life
and death difference in the

00:20:52.503 --> 00:20:54.380
survival of the family.
 

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:59.308
Notice that this all changes
now when modernization comes in.

00:20:59.308 --> 00:21:03.037
One of the things that happens
is children go to school,

00:21:03.037 --> 00:21:06.695
and if they go to school,
they have fewer hours to work

00:21:06.695 --> 00:21:09.338
at home so--their benefits go
down.

00:21:09.338 --> 00:21:12.269
Money has to be provided for
tuition, for books,

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:14.640
for clothing or uniforms,
for shoes.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.189
Children on the farm often
don't have shoes but when they

00:21:17.189 --> 00:21:19.153
go into the city,
to be proper,

00:21:19.153 --> 00:21:21.910
they usually have to have
shoes,

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:24.670
so their costs go up,
their benefit goes down,

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.400
and their cost goes up.
 

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.625
Another aspect of
modernization:

00:21:28.625 --> 00:21:30.710
medicine becomes available.
 

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.645
Now if a child gets sick,
the parents have to spend money

00:21:34.645 --> 00:21:38.653
on doctors or on medicine,
or they perceive that they have

00:21:38.653 --> 00:21:40.269
to do such a thing.
 

00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:44.608
If the family is in the city
and previously--

00:21:44.608 --> 00:21:46.720
and there get to be a lot of
children working,

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.250
but there are also a lot of
adults out of work,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:52.765
the government eventually puts
in child labor laws and says

00:21:52.765 --> 00:21:56.403
children can't work and it makes
it illegal and therefore you

00:21:56.403 --> 00:21:59.452
can't--
children can't work at all,

00:21:59.452 --> 00:22:01.660
their benefit goes down.
 

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.795
All of these things act to
reduce the value of children as

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:11.541
production goods;
they're just not as good a

00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:13.900
production good as they used to
be.

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:17.432
Now consider children as a
consumption good,

00:22:17.432 --> 00:22:22.359
again that's the pleasure or
fulfillment that parents get out

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.250
of having children.
 

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:29.048
One article I read talks about
children as a consumer durable,

00:22:29.048 --> 00:22:31.730
that's because they last a long
time,

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.950
and they're like refrigerators
they last a long time,

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.391
they're a durable good and you
see the reports every month of

00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:40.944
what--
of how many more or less

00:22:40.944 --> 00:22:43.740
durable goods are being bought.
 

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.468
It's very interesting because
the purchase of durable goods,

00:22:47.468 --> 00:22:49.868
you don't usually pay cash for
that.

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:54.134
They go on a credit card and an
easy payment plan for later

00:22:54.134 --> 00:22:57.150
payment and it's the same for
children.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:23:00.397
They don't cost anything--they
don't cost much to make and the

00:23:00.397 --> 00:23:01.410
costs come later.
 

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:04.608
I'm thinking the child is kind
of a like a house.

00:23:04.608 --> 00:23:07.730
If you're poor,
you can or could until the

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:11.460
recent debacle,
buy a house with no money down.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:14.358
So you don't have money and you
get a mortgage.

00:23:14.358 --> 00:23:16.276
It's later on,
after you have the house,

00:23:16.276 --> 00:23:18.240
that you have to,
every year, pay off the

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.880
mortgage.
 

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.916
You've got to maintain the
house, insurance for the house,

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:23.088
taxes for the house.
 

00:23:23.088 --> 00:23:27.990
The upfront cost is very small,
later costs are high.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:31.234
As you know,
a lot of people enjoy shopping

00:23:31.234 --> 00:23:34.250
very much and then once they
choose,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.411
they say this is what I want,
and they get a big bang out of

00:23:37.411 --> 00:23:38.588
the actual purchase.
 

00:23:38.588 --> 00:23:42.277
Making children is very
similar, people enjoy the

00:23:42.277 --> 00:23:45.349
foreplay and then they get a big
bang.

00:23:45.349 --> 00:23:49.329
Well that didn't work very well.
 

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:52.019
Ok.
 

00:23:52.019 --> 00:23:58.065
So, another aspect--finally got
it--another aspect of this is

00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:03.405
children as consumption goods,
and this has to do with

00:24:03.405 --> 00:24:05.220
modernization.
 

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:09.338
You can't consider goods
separately, one from the other.

00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:13.047
People have a certain amount of
money and what they buy will

00:24:13.047 --> 00:24:16.628
depend not only on the cost of
each individual good but on

00:24:16.628 --> 00:24:18.200
their relative costs.
 

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.411
What happens when a country
modernizes with respect to

00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:25.230
children is that the cost of
children is perceived to go up,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.250
education, health,
all these--clothing--

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:33.075
all these costs go up
inexorably, but at the same time

00:24:33.075 --> 00:24:36.180
the cost of manufactured items
goes down.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.743
Radio player,
television, any of the goodies

00:24:39.743 --> 00:24:43.308
that you spend an awful lot of
time with.

00:24:43.308 --> 00:24:45.644
As time goes on,
technology improves,

00:24:45.644 --> 00:24:47.588
the cost of those goes down.
 

00:24:47.588 --> 00:24:51.794
So modernization increases not
only the absolute cost of

00:24:51.794 --> 00:24:54.788
children but more,
even more intensely,

00:24:54.788 --> 00:24:58.259
the relative costs because as
their costs go up,

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:01.410
the costs of other things that
people want go down.

00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:09.031
That's another cause why people
might want fewer children as

00:25:09.031 --> 00:25:10.970
time goes on.
 

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:16.900
Another aspect is the time cost
of children.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:20.070
An important idea is that
people have not only limited

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.818
income,
which they can spend as they

00:25:22.818 --> 00:25:24.923
choose,
but also a limited amount of

00:25:24.923 --> 00:25:27.727
time and we all use the phrase,
spend their time,

00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:31.541
and economists take that as a
serious issue and they think

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:34.420
that time is spent in a rational
manner.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:38.990
Time can be used for leisure,
time can be used for parenting,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.088
or if the person works time can
be money,

00:25:41.088 --> 00:25:43.420
it can be used to work and earn
money,

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:46.380
and each person has to balance,
or each family has to balance,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.068
these things.
 

00:25:48.068 --> 00:25:51.349
Most of the time,
and I'll show you some data on

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:55.328
this, required for childrearing
is spent by the mother.

00:25:55.328 --> 00:25:57.555
In fact, almost exclusively in
most societies,

00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:59.828
the mother does all--basically
all the work.

00:25:59.828 --> 00:26:04.698
In the peasant society the
mother does all the housework,

00:26:04.698 --> 00:26:10.175
everything at home is generally
done by the mother and this time

00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:12.348
is not valued at all.
 

00:26:12.348 --> 00:26:16.173
Mostly in peasant cultures,
women's work at home doesn't

00:26:16.173 --> 00:26:17.940
count,
she may do the--she and the

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.347
children may go out into the
fields and do an awful lot of

00:26:20.347 --> 00:26:23.272
work weeding and everything,
and also again culturally,

00:26:23.272 --> 00:26:25.269
this usually just doesn't
count.

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:29.337
Women's time is not
particularly valued in

00:26:29.337 --> 00:26:31.720
traditional societies.
 

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.566
In traditional times,
she can't get a job,

00:26:34.566 --> 00:26:38.662
so she's not going to be able
to get--there are just no jobs

00:26:38.662 --> 00:26:40.190
available for her.
 

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:44.093
Then modernization comes in and
jobs become available in the

00:26:44.093 --> 00:26:47.068
cash economy and cash is what
people value.

00:26:47.068 --> 00:26:51.536
Cash in an agrarian society is
so rare, so difficult to come by

00:26:51.536 --> 00:26:54.130
that that's what is really
valued.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:59.130
Jobs become available and in
many industrializing situations,

00:26:59.130 --> 00:27:01.240
and especially in the third
world now,

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.278
the first jobs that become
available are low skilled jobs

00:27:04.278 --> 00:27:05.038
like sewing.
 

00:27:05.038 --> 00:27:09.097
Almost every country that
enters into the modern world has

00:27:09.097 --> 00:27:12.230
started its "industrial
revolution"

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:15.896
by sewing jobs in factories;
Bangladesh, Indonesia,

00:27:15.896 --> 00:27:19.682
all over the world sewing is
the first kind of thing and this

00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:21.450
is largely a women's job.
 

00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.134
You see this in China,
all over the world,

00:27:24.134 --> 00:27:27.933
that some of the earliest jobs
in the modern sector are for

00:27:27.933 --> 00:27:28.588
women.
 

00:27:28.588 --> 00:27:30.843
Assembly--you look at
assembly--pictures of assembly

00:27:30.843 --> 00:27:33.759
lines and almost any electronic
goods, who's doing the assembly?

00:27:33.759 --> 00:27:38.048
Very largely women are doing it.
 

00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:43.538
Once job opportunities become
available then you start--you

00:27:43.538 --> 00:27:48.838
set up a competition between
childbearing and working;

00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:50.700
when childbearing the woman is
at home,

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.720
she can't be out in the city
working,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.140
and her time is spent taking
care of the children,

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.490
and therefore she doesn't earn
an income,

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.313
or she can have fewer children
or no children and go to work

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:03.480
and earn income.
 

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.230
Modern--what happens is the
opportunity cost to women,

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:10.076
which was considered
essentially zero in traditional

00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:12.253
times,
starts rising as jobs become

00:28:12.253 --> 00:28:16.824
available for women,
the opportunity cost of having

00:28:16.824 --> 00:28:18.558
children rises.
 

00:28:18.558 --> 00:28:24.018
That's another thing that as
modernization precedes you might

00:28:24.018 --> 00:28:27.930
expect that families want fewer
children.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:31.450
As modernization proceeds
people get richer and all of

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:35.369
these effects might really not
be due to the income but just

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:39.288
time going on in the way that
I've been talking about,

00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:42.009
the changes that modernization
brings.

00:28:42.009 --> 00:28:46.760
Now the third kind of thing
that we have to consider for

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.338
children is to consider them as
an investment good.

00:28:51.338 --> 00:28:54.880
That means you pay now you,
get a return later.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.490
Of course the value of children
doesn't stop,

00:28:57.490 --> 00:29:00.198
but once they grow up,
if the culture has strong

00:29:00.198 --> 00:29:02.753
families,
and that's a very important

00:29:02.753 --> 00:29:05.758
'if,' then the children,
when they grow up,

00:29:05.758 --> 00:29:09.449
will perceive that they have a
responsibility toward the

00:29:09.449 --> 00:29:13.275
parents and that they have
responsibilities to support the

00:29:13.275 --> 00:29:16.430
parents in old age or even
before old age.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:21.308
It's interesting to note that,
if there's no stock market in a

00:29:21.308 --> 00:29:23.385
country,
or banks, and poor people

00:29:23.385 --> 00:29:26.114
really don't have access to
these things in most places at

00:29:26.114 --> 00:29:28.220
the earliest stage of
industrialization,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.940
there's nothing else for people
to invest in.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.048
There's just no market for
things, there's no market for

00:29:33.048 --> 00:29:36.134
their savings,
because rats and insects eat up

00:29:36.134 --> 00:29:40.178
an awful lot of food,
you can't really store the

00:29:40.178 --> 00:29:45.684
food, so basically almost the
only mode of investment is in

00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:49.112
children,
so children are indeed,

00:29:49.112 --> 00:29:54.368
in pre-modern societies,
very much an investment good.

00:29:54.368 --> 00:29:58.020
This is brought home--I mean I
read a lot about this but the

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.054
experience of it in the
developing country is very

00:30:01.054 --> 00:30:02.538
interesting to hear.
 

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:05.068
We had a graduate student,
he was from India,

00:30:05.068 --> 00:30:09.720
and he was from an upper class
family and his family had only a

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.568
few children and all his
relatives,

00:30:12.568 --> 00:30:15.136
his whole class,
the people he really knew had

00:30:15.136 --> 00:30:17.589
already done their fertility
transition,

00:30:17.589 --> 00:30:19.240
had very few children.
 

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:27.480
He was a good hearted soul and
wanted to help poor people,

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.298
so he worked--before he came to
Yale--

00:30:32.298 --> 00:30:34.430
he worked in an adult literacy
program,

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:37.650
that's really one of the best
things that you can do,

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:40.890
and this particular program was
aimed at the very poorest people

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.328
who were still illiterate.
 

00:30:42.328 --> 00:30:45.651
In the course they discussed
everything, because you need

00:30:45.651 --> 00:30:48.853
vocabulary, you need to discuss
it, so there's a lot of

00:30:48.853 --> 00:30:50.868
discussion as well as reading.
 

00:30:50.868 --> 00:30:54.259
One of the things they
discussed was family planning;

00:30:54.259 --> 00:30:56.941
in fact, a nun had been
speaking in the class strongly

00:30:56.941 --> 00:30:59.723
in favor of family planning
trying to convince them that

00:30:59.723 --> 00:31:01.848
they shouldn't have so many
children,

00:31:01.848 --> 00:31:03.828
that they would be better off
with fewer children,

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:06.278
which was the experience of his
social class.

00:31:06.278 --> 00:31:09.205
One day one of the adults took
Anand, this guy,

00:31:09.205 --> 00:31:12.005
aside, and said,
"you know you are wrong

00:31:12.005 --> 00:31:13.660
about family planning.
 

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.848
I have no money to save for
retirement,

00:31:16.848 --> 00:31:20.332
there's no social security,
the government won't care for

00:31:20.332 --> 00:31:23.522
me in old age,
and I need a son to care for me

00:31:23.522 --> 00:31:24.348
in old age.
 

00:31:24.348 --> 00:31:27.625
I have ten children,
if even one of them survives

00:31:27.625 --> 00:31:31.311
and becomes successful,
then I will be lucky and have a

00:31:31.311 --> 00:31:33.358
comfortable old age."
 

00:31:33.358 --> 00:31:37.502
That was very nicely put what
the man said to Anand,

00:31:37.502 --> 00:31:41.240
But there's also Anand's
reaction was also very

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:42.538
interesting.
 

00:31:42.538 --> 00:31:45.281
That even though he grew up
in--and he had never thought

00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:47.000
about that before,
he never heard about it,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.490
he'd never thought about it,
he never perceived it form the

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:52.680
point of view of a poor person
and he was very impressed.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:58.184
When he told me this story,
he said he was just amazed at

00:31:58.184 --> 00:32:03.590
how compelling the argument was
and he couldn't think of

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:08.605
anything to say back to the
person in support of his

00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:10.670
previous views.
 

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:15.221
Again, for the very poorest
people about the only strategy

00:32:15.221 --> 00:32:20.171
they have for old age is to have
children who will take care of

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:22.778
them,
and in most cultures that means

00:32:22.778 --> 00:32:24.528
a son will take care of them.
 

00:32:24.528 --> 00:32:29.380
Kids cost very little in a
poverty stricken culture,

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:35.549
they wear hand-me-down clothes,
they don't have toys or lots of

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:39.538
anything like that,
they get basically no school or

00:32:39.538 --> 00:32:42.483
medical care,
the kind of food that poor

00:32:42.483 --> 00:32:47.430
people eat is fairly cheap and
interesting in terms of time,

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:51.029
beyond the first child,
the first and second child,

00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:52.490
as soon as they get up to be
five, six,

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:54.880
seven, they start taking care
of the younger children,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.338
so the time burden on the
mother sort of goes away once

00:32:57.338 --> 00:32:58.980
you have somewhat older
children,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.691
and older means like five,
and they can start strapping

00:33:01.691 --> 00:33:04.703
the baby on their back and going
around with the baby so that

00:33:04.703 --> 00:33:08.207
extra children are not--
don't even cost much time for

00:33:08.207 --> 00:33:10.190
the parents,
they cost very little money,

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:11.818
you already have all the
hand-me-down things,

00:33:11.818 --> 00:33:15.574
so it's just a subsistence
amount of cheap food that the

00:33:15.574 --> 00:33:16.528
child needs.
 

00:33:16.528 --> 00:33:22.173
It's--children are a very small
cost and they're a benefit as

00:33:22.173 --> 00:33:27.630
old age insurance is perceived
to be quite, quite great.

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:34.548
What happens as
modernization--so parents are

00:33:34.548 --> 00:33:39.486
basically willing--
poor parents are willing to

00:33:39.486 --> 00:33:43.060
invest the little bit that they
have and a little bit that's

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.940
needed in a lot of children.
 

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.750
How does modernization affect
this investment?

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.307
If jobs start to be available
in the cities and/or

00:33:51.307 --> 00:33:55.230
possibilities open up for
migration abroad to jobs,

00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:56.940
all the people from India and
Pakistan,

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.049
they go to the Middle East to
work in oil related jobs,

00:34:00.049 --> 00:34:03.623
to the rich economies;
people come to America to find

00:34:03.623 --> 00:34:04.190
jobs.
 

00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:08.605
They all send back remittances;
at least the first generation

00:34:08.605 --> 00:34:11.789
is very, very good about sending
back remittances,

00:34:11.789 --> 00:34:15.170
which is a huge fraction of
poor people's income.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:18.181
Even though the remittances may
not be a huge fraction or what

00:34:18.181 --> 00:34:20.599
they're earning in America or in
Saudi Arabia,

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:24.130
in terms of the income that
their parents are living on,

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:26.230
and poverty stricken,
it can be a very,

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:30.389
very big increment to their
income.

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:35.144
Children can be a really good
investment, if they can get a

00:34:35.144 --> 00:34:38.096
job in the city,
or get a job abroad,

00:34:38.096 --> 00:34:41.130
they're a really good
investment.

00:34:41.130 --> 00:34:43.981
Modernization increases,
everything else it

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:47.375
decreases--the value of
children, but modernization

00:34:47.375 --> 00:34:51.182
increases their value;
this aspect of their value as

00:34:51.182 --> 00:34:52.239
an investment.
 

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:56.255
Several other things happen
during modernization that

00:34:56.255 --> 00:34:58.960
increase the value as
investment.

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.788
First of all child mortality,
the first thing in a

00:35:01.788 --> 00:35:05.295
demographic transition,
or usually the first thing that

00:35:05.295 --> 00:35:08.659
happens is a quite severe drop
in infant mortality.

00:35:08.659 --> 00:35:11.389
What that means is children now
are likely to grow up.

00:35:11.389 --> 00:35:17.188
Previously children died very
young or died at various times

00:35:17.188 --> 00:35:20.969
in their young ages,
and if something is going to

00:35:20.969 --> 00:35:22.882
disappear,
like if something is going to

00:35:22.882 --> 00:35:25.235
get stolen from you,
you don't try to buy a really

00:35:25.235 --> 00:35:28.077
fancy car if you're pretty sure
it's going to get stolen and

00:35:28.077 --> 00:35:29.860
it's the same thing with
children.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.836
If the odds are very high that
your children are going to die

00:35:32.836 --> 00:35:35.364
it's really not--
and if modern medicine isn't

00:35:35.364 --> 00:35:38.384
available --
it's not really a good idea to

00:35:38.384 --> 00:35:42.800
put a lot of investment into a
child that's going to die.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.530
As modernization--some ideas of
sanitation,

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:49.414
public health come into play,
and the expectation that

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:53.657
children will live increases,
and then there is a longer

00:35:53.657 --> 00:35:57.889
period for them to live and
return income to the parents.

00:35:57.889 --> 00:36:01.090
The other side of the coin is
pretty much the same;

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.768
the parents are living longer.
 

00:36:02.768 --> 00:36:08.407
In the old style of fertility,
married people just kept having

00:36:08.407 --> 00:36:13.675
children until they became
sterile at 45 or something like

00:36:13.675 --> 00:36:15.831
that,
and then at the old life

00:36:15.831 --> 00:36:18.911
expectancy they didn't have much
longer to live and they were

00:36:18.911 --> 00:36:23.159
still capable of working at 40,
45 and then they die.

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:26.918
Even if they have children that
stay alive, there's not a long

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:30.307
period of dependency where
they'll get income from their

00:36:30.307 --> 00:36:31.110
children.
 

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:37.242
If you have your last child at
say 40 or 45 then they're going

00:36:37.242 --> 00:36:42.170
to reach maturity when you're 60
or something,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:47.199
almost 60 and that's at or
above the life expectancy in

00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:49.250
very poor countries.
 

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:55.329
The increased longevity of both
children and parents make it a

00:36:55.329 --> 00:37:01.210
much better deal to have
children as an investment good,

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.889
because there's a longer time
they can pay you and you're

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:08.239
going to be around for a longer
time to get this.

00:37:08.239 --> 00:37:13.010
As opposed to the other ways
that children are looked at

00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.940
economically,
as an investment good

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:20.340
modernization can massively
increase the value of children.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.889
That would be--we have
counterbalancing--

00:37:22.889 --> 00:37:26.268
if people have more money as
modernization goes on,

00:37:26.268 --> 00:37:28.110
you think they could afford
more children,

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.340
but they become less good as
consumption goods,

00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:33.768
they become less good as
production goods,

00:37:33.768 --> 00:37:36.960
but they come much better as
investment goods.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.014
Of course as people have more
money, they have more money that

00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:42.166
they can save,
and one of the ways they save

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:44.268
it is by investing it in the
children.

00:37:44.268 --> 00:37:48.762
One of the issues then is if
the value of children is now

00:37:48.762 --> 00:37:53.016
mostly as an investment good,
how do you maximize this

00:37:53.016 --> 00:37:54.219
investment?
 

00:37:54.219 --> 00:37:58.702
In agrarian societies there are
really no opportunities outside

00:37:58.702 --> 00:38:02.969
farming, that's what the society
does, period we're done.

00:38:02.969 --> 00:38:06.429
If, indeed, the agriculture is
traditional,

00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:08.900
you're doing it exactly the way
your grandfather did it,

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.253
and his grandfather did it,
and that's a very safe way to

00:38:13.253 --> 00:38:16.829
farm because you're on the edge
of survival.

00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:19.902
If your crop doesn't grow
you're in big trouble,

00:38:19.902 --> 00:38:23.697
so if you try something new
there's always a danger that it

00:38:23.697 --> 00:38:24.940
might not work.
 

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.871
If you do something the way
it's been done for hundreds of

00:38:27.871 --> 00:38:30.853
years or thousands of years or
you perceive as thousands of

00:38:30.853 --> 00:38:32.860
years in your family on your
land,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:34.650
you're pretty sure that it's
going to work.

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:37.815
You may not get an awful lot
out of it but you're sure it's

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:38.690
going to work.
 

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.311
Peasants are very conservative,
not only about their

00:38:43.311 --> 00:38:46.331
production,
their agricultural production

00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:49.715
but everything else in their
life because they don't have

00:38:49.715 --> 00:38:53.856
anything extra to gamble with,
so they're not going to take on

00:38:53.856 --> 00:38:54.800
anything new.
 

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.262
The old way of doing it,
the father passes it onto the

00:38:57.262 --> 00:38:59.030
son exactly as he has been doing
it.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:03.090
You don't need an education to
do farming in a traditional kind

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:05.768
of way;
you learn it while doing it

00:39:05.768 --> 00:39:07.159
with your father.
 

00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:13.981
When education gets
modernized--when agriculture

00:39:13.981 --> 00:39:17.860
gets modernized,
there's fertilizers,

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.967
there's new varieties of seeds,
you have to pay attention to

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.617
money and when you enter into
the market economy you have to

00:39:23.617 --> 00:39:26.179
have some mathematical abilities
to know about money,

00:39:26.179 --> 00:39:28.050
you may have to borrow money,
there's interest rates,

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:31.076
there's payback schedules,
there's all kinds of things so

00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:33.670
that education starts becoming
very valuable,

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.920
even in agriculture.
 

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:42.115
Early on, the combination of
not needing education and the

00:39:42.115 --> 00:39:46.900
probability that the kids will
die young,

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.402
there's really not much benefit
in investing in education in an

00:39:51.402 --> 00:39:53.510
early agricultural society.
 

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:58.634
The best strategy at that time
is to have a lot of children and

00:39:58.634 --> 00:40:03.675
put a minimal investment in each
of them and hope that some of

00:40:03.675 --> 00:40:07.550
them don't die,
and that's in fact empirically

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:10.371
true,
that the investment before the

00:40:10.371 --> 00:40:14.552
demographic transition,
the investment that people put

00:40:14.552 --> 00:40:18.775
into their children was indeed
very small and subsistence

00:40:18.775 --> 00:40:21.489
carried on the way it always
was.

00:40:21.489 --> 00:40:26.170
Now population increases
because foreign foods come in,

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.329
all kinds of things happen,
and population starts

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:33.449
increasing, land becomes scarce.
 

00:40:33.449 --> 00:40:37.456
Now imagine you have a small
farm and you yourself are living

00:40:37.456 --> 00:40:40.621
as a subsistence farmer,
and you've got a whole bunch of

00:40:40.621 --> 00:40:42.873
kids,
and now you're faced with

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:45.829
dividing up your land among the
kids.

00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:48.130
Well you know the kids aren't
going to be able to do it,

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:51.077
you can barely do it on your
size farm as you divide it up

00:40:51.077 --> 00:40:52.822
among two,
three or so sons,

00:40:52.822 --> 00:40:56.170
and it just isn't going to work
so you're in crisis.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.862
When the kids inherit such a
little bit of land not only are

00:40:59.862 --> 00:41:03.188
they going to have big trouble,
but they're not going to have

00:41:03.188 --> 00:41:05.210
any excess to provide for you,
so children,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.599
stop becoming children if they
stay in the farm economy,

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:13.728
stop becoming any kind of a
decent investment to keep you

00:41:13.728 --> 00:41:18.675
going when you're getting a
little old so you've got to

00:41:18.675 --> 00:41:24.969
figure out what to do,
you're facing a crisis.

00:41:24.969 --> 00:41:28.829
The outside economy is
modernizing,

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:31.297
you may not be modernizing but
the outside economy is

00:41:31.297 --> 00:41:33.994
modernizing,
and jobs become available,

00:41:33.994 --> 00:41:37.809
largely jobs that require some
sort of education;

00:41:37.809 --> 00:41:39.900
white collar jobs,
the government jobs.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.699
Big, huge bureaucracies spring
up, that--

00:41:42.699 --> 00:41:45.090
I'll mention that in a little
bit --

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:50.992
and parents rather rapidly
realize that the only option is

00:41:50.992 --> 00:41:55.860
for the kids to go to the city
and get a job.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:58.744
But, all the parents,
everybody reaches that state

00:41:58.744 --> 00:42:02.242
pretty much at the same time,
so the cities are just flooded

00:42:02.242 --> 00:42:05.309
with people coming in looking
for the still scarce jobs.

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:07.210
How do you have an edge up?
 

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.887
It has to be education,
that is the only way you can

00:42:09.887 --> 00:42:12.514
get these white collar jobs,
you absolutely need an

00:42:12.514 --> 00:42:13.250
education.
 

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:16.181
In manufacturing jobs you do
better, you have to deal with

00:42:16.181 --> 00:42:18.119
machinery;
you have to know things about

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:18.619
machinery.
 

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:24.324
I was in Peru quite a ways back
and they took peasants off the

00:42:24.324 --> 00:42:26.869
Altiplano,
this high dry plain where

00:42:26.869 --> 00:42:29.291
there's no water,
the land is terrible,

00:42:29.291 --> 00:42:31.510
and they live on about $1 a
day.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:33.650
In order to get a job in the
mines,

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.369
the first job is you take a
shovel and you--

00:42:36.369 --> 00:42:40.494
there's big machines that eat
away at the rock face but a lot

00:42:40.494 --> 00:42:43.286
of it drops down,
and they need people with

00:42:43.286 --> 00:42:46.690
shovels to get the rest of it
and dump it into the trucks,

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:49.750
so this is really a minimum
skill labor job.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.530
They needed to have two things,
which not everyone had,

00:42:52.530 --> 00:42:55.219
1) to know that machines can be
dangerous,

00:42:55.219 --> 00:42:57.489
that they can get hot from
spinning around,

00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:59.980
that they can be electrified,
that you don't just touch

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.010
something unless you know what's
going on.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:05.449
The second thing) you have to
know enough about time to get to

00:43:05.449 --> 00:43:07.940
the job on time every day;
the shift comes on,

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.090
you've got to be there.
 

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:14.643
The peasants don't come knowing
those sorts of things and those

00:43:14.643 --> 00:43:20.110
that do know those things can
double their income to $2 a day,

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.349
if they can get jobs.
 

00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:28.583
That's even the most basic kind
of job requires a kind of

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:35.264
mindset and educational thing
that you don't get generally on

00:43:35.264 --> 00:43:36.489
a farm.
 

00:43:36.489 --> 00:43:46.360
Education becomes an extremely
valuable commodity.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:52.199
But, in order to get the job
and to stay alive,

00:43:52.199 --> 00:43:55.978
kids have to be healthy,
so you have to put money into

00:43:55.978 --> 00:44:00.186
education and you also have to
put money into health for the

00:44:00.186 --> 00:44:02.539
kids that's the prerequisite.
 

00:44:02.539 --> 00:44:05.882
If you have a bond,
like a kid, you've got to have

00:44:05.882 --> 00:44:09.646
a safe-deposit box for it,
that's like health insurance or

00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:13.407
healthcare for it,
otherwise it's going to

00:44:13.407 --> 00:44:15.449
disappear on you.
 

00:44:15.449 --> 00:44:19.663
This investment in children,
which in education and

00:44:19.663 --> 00:44:22.949
healthcare, becomes a very good
deal;

00:44:22.949 --> 00:44:25.614
that if you can manage to
invest that much in your child

00:44:25.614 --> 00:44:28.067
and go to the city or go abroad,
get a good job,

00:44:28.067 --> 00:44:30.947
and their income will be so
much more than yours that they

00:44:30.947 --> 00:44:33.070
can send you back a significant
amount.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.929
These investments in children
are called human capital,

00:44:35.929 --> 00:44:38.650
or the result of them is called
human capital,

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:41.650
it's the health and education
of the population.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:45.784
It's now realized that when
economists study "why is

00:44:45.784 --> 00:44:49.329
one country rich and one country
poor?",

00:44:49.329 --> 00:44:51.880
well part of it is their
physical, their stock of

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:52.889
physical capital.
 

00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:56.070
Physical capital is the
factories, the machines,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.050
the buildings,
and all the stuff that you can

00:44:59.050 --> 00:44:59.929
knock on.
 

00:44:59.929 --> 00:45:02.889
They've realized that that's
not the biggest difference,

00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:05.208
the biggest difference is
human--what they call human

00:45:05.208 --> 00:45:08.338
capital,
how educated and how healthy

00:45:08.338 --> 00:45:10.130
the population is.
 

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:12.860
So it's a very big thing.
 

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:18.773
An interesting thing,
we have two different factors

00:45:18.773 --> 00:45:24.333
that are now in play,
why a child becomes a good

00:45:24.333 --> 00:45:26.699
investment good.
 

00:45:26.699 --> 00:45:30.239
One, with education they can
get a higher paying job,

00:45:30.239 --> 00:45:34.668
and with better health they can
live longer and the parents can

00:45:34.668 --> 00:45:37.949
live longer,
so they're paying you back not

00:45:37.949 --> 00:45:42.518
only at a higher rate if they're
educated and healthy but for a

00:45:42.518 --> 00:45:44.139
longer time period.
 

00:45:44.139 --> 00:45:46.440
We normally think of that
things add,

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:50.190
well you get a certain benefit
from their education,

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.717
earning more per year,
and you get a certain benefit

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:54.923
from their health,
they're living longer and you

00:45:54.923 --> 00:45:56.369
might be tempted to add those
two,

00:45:56.369 --> 00:45:58.280
but in fact they multiply.
 

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:02.945
That you're getting a certain
extra amount per year over 30

00:46:02.945 --> 00:46:07.791
years or something like that,
so the two factors multiply and

00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:12.188
that's one of the really big
things in Becker's theory is how

00:46:12.188 --> 00:46:17.099
these factors that go into the
increment a child will bring in,

00:46:17.099 --> 00:46:21.416
the health and the education
multiply with each other and so

00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:25.804
even fairly small increments in
either one lead to a very big

00:46:25.804 --> 00:46:29.277
return;
multiplication is a very large

00:46:29.277 --> 00:46:29.989
effect.
 

00:46:29.989 --> 00:46:34.219
The end of this that as an
investment good,

00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:37.750
investment in children's health
and education is very rewarding,

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.065
it's a really rewarding kind of
investment in the kind of

00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:43.909
economic situation that we've
been discussing.

00:46:43.909 --> 00:46:48.309
Here's the catch,
that if you're poor you can't

00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:53.380
make these investments in a
whole lot of children,

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:56.782
and so the best strategy,
instead of having a lot of

00:46:56.782 --> 00:47:00.920
children and dividing up your
assets among a bunch of them,

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.289
you have a very few children
and you concentrate your assets,

00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:07.429
you concentrate what you can
invest in a few children,

00:47:07.429 --> 00:47:10.804
and you get them fairly good
healthcare and as good an

00:47:10.804 --> 00:47:12.969
education as you can get for it.
 

00:47:12.969 --> 00:47:16.119
Children that have these two
things,

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:18.360
it's called the quality of the
child,

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.420
again that's another economic
jargon term,

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:24.255
that the health and education
of a child are the quality of

00:47:24.255 --> 00:47:25.050
the child.
 

00:47:25.050 --> 00:47:30.824
The way this change that goes
on in the demographic transition

00:47:30.824 --> 00:47:35.842
is called the switch or the
trade off from quantity to

00:47:35.842 --> 00:47:36.980
quality.
 

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.199
Before the transition parents
want a lot of children because

00:47:40.199 --> 00:47:43.418
the main thing they're worried
about is the probability that

00:47:43.418 --> 00:47:46.693
they're just going to die and
there's nothing the parents can

00:47:46.693 --> 00:47:49.514
do about that,
the local folk medicine is

00:47:49.514 --> 00:47:53.315
almost totally ineffective so
the kids are just going to die

00:47:53.315 --> 00:47:58.315
kind of randomly,
but as time goes on that's not

00:47:58.315 --> 00:48:02.199
true anymore,
they can do something to keep

00:48:02.199 --> 00:48:06.393
their kids alive and they get
the kids educated so that they

00:48:06.393 --> 00:48:08.809
can earn a good rate of income.
 

00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:12.911
There's this trade,
a switch from wanting quantity

00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:16.010
to wanting quality in the
children.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:20.719
Parents catch onto this very
quickly,

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:24.213
some of the very rapidity of
some of the third world

00:48:24.213 --> 00:48:27.159
fertility declines has been due
to that--

00:48:27.159 --> 00:48:30.599
when the land gets filled up by
people it becomes very obvious

00:48:30.599 --> 00:48:33.981
right away that you've got to do
something and the only thing

00:48:33.981 --> 00:48:36.349
available are jobs in the cities
and--

00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:41.422
they know very well that the
kids need education to compete

00:48:41.422 --> 00:48:43.260
in that job market.
 

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:48.650
In terms of policy you get some
really interesting kind of

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:49.880
conundrums.
 

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:53.119
One is, education is what the
people want,

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:57.539
they want it desperately and
yet if they keep having eight

00:48:57.539 --> 00:49:00.001
children,
the country is going to be

00:49:00.001 --> 00:49:02.608
hopeless,
so policy makers like the idea

00:49:02.608 --> 00:49:06.134
that in order to get an
education people have to reduce

00:49:06.134 --> 00:49:09.518
their fertility,
but they also with good hearts

00:49:09.518 --> 00:49:11.530
want to make education free.
 

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.362
The question in a developing
country is how much to charge

00:49:15.362 --> 00:49:16.440
for education.
 

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:19.940
Its a very, very major issue
because you need to strike a

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:23.231
balance between--
setting the price low enough so

00:49:23.231 --> 00:49:26.690
that you can get a lot of your
children educated,

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:30.945
yet setting some price so that
it's an incentive to parents to

00:49:30.945 --> 00:49:35.409
not just absolutely flood the
system and overwhelm everything.

00:49:35.409 --> 00:49:40.014
Wherever you set this ,
parents will always use

00:49:40.014 --> 00:49:43.920
strategies to maximize their
benefit.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.900
One of the kind of strategies
that people worry about,

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.608
that parents can do,
is the first child stays at

00:49:51.608 --> 00:49:53.965
home,
second child stays at home,

00:49:53.965 --> 00:49:57.422
eventually that child grows up
and starts doing work and then

00:49:57.422 --> 00:50:00.650
they can do the work around the
house that's needed,

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:03.309
and the weeding the fields and
the work on the farm.

00:50:03.309 --> 00:50:05.608
The third child is now,
in a sense, surplus,

00:50:05.608 --> 00:50:07.159
you don't need their labor.
 

00:50:07.159 --> 00:50:09.579
If there's free education you
get them educated,

00:50:09.579 --> 00:50:12.351
send them to the city,
and you can do that if there's

00:50:12.351 --> 00:50:14.750
no cost to getting a child
educated third,

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.449
fourth, fifth,
sixth there's no limit to the

00:50:16.449 --> 00:50:18.110
number of children that you
could have,

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.739
you send them all off to the
city, they send you back money.

00:50:20.739 --> 00:50:24.034
Same with healthcare,
that if you have a welfare

00:50:24.034 --> 00:50:27.469
government and it doesn't set
this just right,

00:50:27.469 --> 00:50:31.590
if healthcare is also free or
nearly free,

00:50:31.590 --> 00:50:34.679
then again there's no cost to
having the extra children,

00:50:34.679 --> 00:50:38.590
people may continue to have
that many children and then the

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:42.027
whole system just gets flooded
and you have a failed

00:50:42.027 --> 00:50:43.039
experiment.
 

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:49.070
Education and healthcare are
some of the fundamental

00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:56.518
variables in this relationship
between economic development,

00:50:56.518 --> 00:50:59.829
jobs becoming available,
and how many children that you

00:50:59.829 --> 00:51:00.260
have.
 

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.489
In developing countries,
as you know,

00:51:03.489 --> 00:51:05.739
there are a lot of people,
labor is cheap,

00:51:05.739 --> 00:51:08.130
but capital is scare,
they're not rich,

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:12.699
they don't have a lot to invest
in factories and everything,

00:51:12.699 --> 00:51:15.458
so it's hard for them to build
a steel plant or a petrochemical

00:51:15.458 --> 00:51:17.376
plant,
that takes a lot of bucks and a

00:51:17.376 --> 00:51:18.210
lot of know how.
 

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:21.389
What about producing a teacher?
 

00:51:21.389 --> 00:51:24.719
Is that an expensive or a cheap
proposition?

00:51:24.719 --> 00:51:27.951
Teaching is labor intensive,
it's not capital intensive,

00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:31.652
you need maybe a chalkboard and
some chalk and some places don't

00:51:31.652 --> 00:51:32.768
even have that.
 

00:51:32.768 --> 00:51:36.432
Education, being labor
intensive, it is one of the

00:51:36.432 --> 00:51:39.199
cheap things that countries can
do.

00:51:39.199 --> 00:51:43.081
Basically even the poorest
country can have surplus labor,

00:51:43.081 --> 00:51:46.213
largely female,
and give it a minimal amount of

00:51:46.213 --> 00:51:47.099
training.
 

00:51:47.099 --> 00:51:50.585
All you have to do is make them
basically literate and they can

00:51:50.585 --> 00:51:53.791
go out into the villages and
teach children to read and to

00:51:53.791 --> 00:51:56.356
write,
which is amazing progress,

00:51:56.356 --> 00:51:58.829
and then that bootstraps
itself.

00:51:58.829 --> 00:52:02.420
If you look at developing
countries, that's one of the

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:04.518
things they really invest in.
 

00:52:04.518 --> 00:52:10.869
First, primary education and
they get a big return from that;

00:52:10.869 --> 00:52:12.768
they have the finances to do
that.

00:52:12.768 --> 00:52:17.521
In fact, almost all developing
countries also have a pretty

00:52:17.521 --> 00:52:22.192
good university structure,
not a research level university

00:52:22.192 --> 00:52:24.650
but a teaching university.
 

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.579
If you look at places--they're
producing doctors--

00:52:27.579 --> 00:52:30.849
I don't know if you know this,
but in America something like

00:52:30.849 --> 00:52:34.340
half of all the doctors that get
licensed are trained abroad.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.085
Now some of them are from
England, Sweden,

00:52:36.085 --> 00:52:38.639
Germany that are training them
pretty much the way we are.

00:52:38.639 --> 00:52:39.809
But, more are coming in from
India,

00:52:39.809 --> 00:52:42.590
Pakistan, Philippines,
places like that,

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.900
and the people are just as
smart as anywhere else,

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.750
they maybe work harder,
more ambitious,

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:52.172
maybe it's harder even to get
into but they can train

00:52:52.172 --> 00:52:54.610
thousands and thousands of
doctors.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:58.059
A medical school class in
Mexico City would be like 3,000

00:52:58.059 --> 00:53:01.505
students or something,
the law classes are all very,

00:53:01.505 --> 00:53:05.188
very huge because it's cheap
and the marginal cost if you

00:53:05.188 --> 00:53:08.277
already have a class in
physiology with somebody

00:53:08.277 --> 00:53:11.117
lecturing,
add another 100 students

00:53:11.117 --> 00:53:13.130
doesn't cost you anything.
 

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:17.307
Education up to very high
levels is something that

00:53:17.307 --> 00:53:22.168
developing countries can often
afford because it's a labor

00:53:22.168 --> 00:53:24.300
intensive occupation.
 

00:53:24.300 --> 00:53:27.652
When you think of the brain
drain, what happens then is you

00:53:27.652 --> 00:53:30.139
get more doctors than India can
support,

00:53:30.139 --> 00:53:33.050
more doctors than Mexico can
support,

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:35.353
so they want to come to the
United States and you get the

00:53:35.353 --> 00:53:35.929
brain drain.
 

00:53:35.929 --> 00:53:38.583
The most highly educated people
from all these developing

00:53:38.583 --> 00:53:40.469
countries,
which the government has

00:53:40.469 --> 00:53:42.639
invested in to pay for their
education,

00:53:42.639 --> 00:53:44.619
they go to England,
they go to America,

00:53:44.619 --> 00:53:46.710
they go to France,
they go to Japan,

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:49.889
if they're allowed in,
and they get a job.

00:53:49.889 --> 00:53:52.635
That's the old style
brain-drain, where the people

00:53:52.635 --> 00:53:56.463
physically move to here,
but it's also the modern job

00:53:56.463 --> 00:53:58.826
flight that now,
again as I said,

00:53:58.826 --> 00:54:01.893
with the internet and cheap
shipping costs all these jobs

00:54:01.893 --> 00:54:05.179
can stay in India or somewhere
and we ship the jobs out,

00:54:05.179 --> 00:54:06.119
the accounting.
 

00:54:06.119 --> 00:54:09.085
Accounting is done in the
daytime, banks do all kinds of

00:54:09.085 --> 00:54:11.429
transactions,
they ship all that data

00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:14.130
overnight to India and during
our night,

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.577
which is India's day,
the Indian accountants work on

00:54:16.577 --> 00:54:19.409
it and by the morning you have
all your accounts settled.

00:54:19.409 --> 00:54:23.840
Engineering is worked on in
Chicago during the day and then,

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.050
however far the plans have got,
is shipped off to again,

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:29.784
usually India,
and the architects there work

00:54:29.784 --> 00:54:32.139
on it and ship it back to
Chicago,

00:54:32.139 --> 00:54:34.699
and that's increasing.
 

00:54:34.699 --> 00:54:38.768
One of the important factors in
this is basically the cheapness

00:54:38.768 --> 00:54:41.476
of education,
that education is a labor

00:54:41.476 --> 00:54:45.190
intensive operation and so
developing countries can do it

00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:46.119
quite well.
 

00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:49.659
Within the developing
countries, they can rather

00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:53.577
rapidly produce a lot of say
college educated people,

00:54:53.577 --> 00:54:56.440
and these people expect good
jobs.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:59.076
They've risen up,
maybe by a great amount of

00:54:59.076 --> 00:55:01.568
effort,
risen up from the utter poverty

00:55:01.568 --> 00:55:05.083
in their villages and now they
have a college education and

00:55:05.083 --> 00:55:06.719
they're ready for a job.
 

00:55:06.719 --> 00:55:10.420
The country usually doesn't
have jobs for them,

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:14.889
the economy is not yet
developed, so what is there--

00:55:14.889 --> 00:55:19.139
there's a tremendous demand
for--for white collar jobs.

00:55:19.139 --> 00:55:22.059
And if they don't get these
white collar jobs,

00:55:22.059 --> 00:55:26.018
there is tremendous unrest
among the young educated people;

00:55:26.018 --> 00:55:27.150
they're very verbal,
they know each other,

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:29.050
they know how to communicate,
they're mobile,

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:32.704
you can have a very unstable
political situation develop

00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:33.570
right away.
 

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.880
The governments in all these
places almost always respond

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:38.684
with government jobs,
since there isn't--the private

00:55:38.684 --> 00:55:41.469
sector is not yet capable of
producing jobs,

00:55:41.469 --> 00:55:42.768
there's government jobs.
 

00:55:42.768 --> 00:55:46.074
You get these enormously
bloated bureaucracies in almost

00:55:46.074 --> 00:55:48.360
every underdeveloped country
where,

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:51.300
to do the tiniest little thing
you need 16 different people to

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.585
stamp it,
sign it, and approve it,

00:55:53.585 --> 00:55:57.637
and it takes three days for
each of these people to make a

00:55:57.637 --> 00:55:58.489
decision.
 

00:55:58.489 --> 00:56:03.018
That's sort of--things get out
of whack when--

00:56:03.018 --> 00:56:06.353
because it's cheap you can
produce a lot of education but

00:56:06.353 --> 00:56:09.688
then you can't them jobs and
once you establish these big

00:56:09.688 --> 00:56:12.121
bureaucracies,
then further economic

00:56:12.121 --> 00:56:15.780
development may become difficult
because to do the slightest

00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:18.070
thing,
build a factory or do something

00:56:18.070 --> 00:56:20.981
new or import something you have
to go through all this

00:56:20.981 --> 00:56:21.789
bureaucracy.
 

00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:24.793
Because the government doesn't
have money to pay these people,

00:56:24.793 --> 00:56:26.909
they get paid very poorly,
so corruption;

00:56:26.909 --> 00:56:30.686
if you give us a very small
bribe this is a wonderful thing

00:56:30.686 --> 00:56:33.670
for the bureaucrat,
so he'll pay attention to your

00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:36.771
thing and only take two days
instead of three days to approve

00:56:36.771 --> 00:56:38.579
whatever it is you've given him.
 

00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:43.184
Again, this is the problem of
the relation between demography

00:56:43.184 --> 00:56:48.018
and international and economic
development in poor countries.

00:56:48.018 --> 00:56:49.320
It's all these interlocking
things;

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:52.706
the demography always
interlocks with every other

00:56:52.706 --> 00:56:55.389
aspect of your economic
development.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:08.739
In terms of the whole picture
of the changes in the world,

00:57:08.739 --> 00:57:11.420
probably this is the kind of
sequence--

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:17.146
we've talked about a lot of
different factors that happen to

00:57:17.146 --> 00:57:20.059
bring people into modernity.
 

00:57:20.059 --> 00:57:24.909
I want to sort of summarize a
lot of that.

00:57:24.909 --> 00:57:28.079
The first thing that apparently
happens,

00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:32.744
it starts in the renaissance in
the West and continues on into

00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:35.224
the enlightenment,
and then the industrial

00:57:35.224 --> 00:57:35.679
revolution.
 

00:57:35.679 --> 00:57:38.659
The first thing that happens is
people stop thinking

00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:42.166
supernaturally about things and
start thinking about the real

00:57:42.166 --> 00:57:45.090
world and trying to think
rationally about it.

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:48.920
Technological progress ensues
and allows them better shipping,

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.016
better navigation,
they get all the way to

00:57:51.016 --> 00:57:53.135
America,
discover American foods,

00:57:53.135 --> 00:57:56.960
bring them back and start a
population increase in Europe.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.880
Good ways to prevent disease
are discovered,

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.489
industrial revolution increases
productivity,

00:58:03.489 --> 00:58:06.554
you start thinking rationally
about things and everything can

00:58:06.554 --> 00:58:07.219
get better.
 

00:58:07.219 --> 00:58:12.635
More food means less death and
so population increases and this

00:58:12.635 --> 00:58:17.090
starts in the 1700s in Europe
and really starts--

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.865
1900s in the currently
developing countries and we saw

00:58:21.865 --> 00:58:26.302
before that sometime--
that the relationship between

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:30.380
mortality drop and fertility
drop was not a given,

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.362
but in almost all cases,
whether they went in parallel

00:58:34.362 --> 00:58:37.070
and mortality was below
fertility.

00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:40.525
Since early time,
population has been increasing

00:58:40.525 --> 00:58:43.018
and,
even in an agrarian society,

00:58:43.018 --> 00:58:46.764
that means as population
increases the pressure on the

00:58:46.764 --> 00:58:50.721
land is going to go up and
you're going to get tinier and

00:58:50.721 --> 00:58:53.760
tinier plots until you reach a
crisis.

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:58.429
Now, some places--Remember what
a surprise we had that England,

00:58:58.429 --> 00:59:00.882
which was industrially
advanced, its urbanization was

00:59:00.882 --> 00:59:02.269
advanced,
its education was advanced,

00:59:02.269 --> 00:59:04.909
everything was advanced,
but it had one of the latest

00:59:04.909 --> 00:59:06.429
fertility transitions.
 

00:59:06.429 --> 00:59:07.679
Why?
 

00:59:07.679 --> 00:59:10.856
Maybe because of primogeniture,
that they didn't have that kind

00:59:10.856 --> 00:59:13.931
of pressure on the land because
only the oldest son inherited

00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:16.750
and the land plots did not get
smaller and smaller.

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:20.391
The political structure was
such that the landed gentry were

00:59:20.391 --> 00:59:23.849
the ones that controlled
parliament and the cities really

00:59:23.849 --> 00:59:27.369
didn't count that much where the
excess people were,

00:59:27.369 --> 00:59:32.601
so England did not experience
the same kind of tinier and

00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:37.646
tinier plots and the vast
amounts of rural poverty that

00:59:37.646 --> 00:59:39.610
other places had.
 

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:44.840
Anyway, with the scarcity of
land,

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.469
the plots gets smaller and huge
number--

00:59:47.469 --> 00:59:50.882
in most places--huge numbers of
people fall into this abject

00:59:50.882 --> 00:59:52.268
kind of rural poverty.
 

00:59:52.268 --> 00:59:55.313
Then the two things that I've
talked about today or one of the

00:59:55.313 --> 00:59:57.860
things that I've talked about
today happens next.

00:59:57.860 --> 01:00:01.199
First, individual families have
to figure out a new strategy,

01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:04.710
they realize that education for
kids is the only way out of

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:08.222
their situation and that means
that they have to have fewer

01:00:08.222 --> 01:00:09.010
children.
 

01:00:09.010 --> 01:00:11.467
At the same time,
with respect to the currently

01:00:11.467 --> 01:00:14.195
developing countries,
the Western governments either

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:17.038
out of the goodness of their
heart or because they're scared

01:00:17.038 --> 01:00:19.014
about revolution,
and communism,

01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:22.552
and anti-Americanism,
they have to help the third

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:27.039
world so they start supporting
family programs and what they do

01:00:27.039 --> 01:00:28.268
is two things.
 

01:00:28.268 --> 01:00:32.820
One, they buy advertising and
just setting up clinics,

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.949
the social, the cultural
acceptability of controlling

01:00:35.949 --> 01:00:38.717
fertility by some sort of
contraception becomes

01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:39.619
acceptable.
 

01:00:39.619 --> 01:00:43.056
It's not anymore a totally
taboo topic, and then they

01:00:43.056 --> 01:00:46.757
actually provide the goods
themselves so it allows people

01:00:46.757 --> 01:00:47.550
to work.
 

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.626
Their economic interest is in
having fewer children but if

01:00:50.626 --> 01:00:52.378
they're--
if there are not the

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:54.869
contraceptives available as say
in China,

01:00:54.869 --> 01:00:57.431
there was for a long time,
or it's not culturally

01:00:57.431 --> 01:01:00.550
acceptable,
they can't act on that desire.

01:01:00.550 --> 01:01:03.246
Family planning programs come
in, either government ones or

01:01:03.246 --> 01:01:06.849
foreign supported ones;
their own government supported

01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:11.565
ones or foreign ones and that
allows people to act on their

01:01:11.565 --> 01:01:14.329
desires to have fewer children.
 

01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:19.286
Then fertility falls because
they're now using some sort of

01:01:19.286 --> 01:01:23.599
contraception and then,
as we saw, I guess last

01:01:23.599 --> 01:01:29.048
lecture, that when fertility
falls then you get this bulge of

01:01:29.048 --> 01:01:32.409
workers and the economy takes
off.

01:01:32.409 --> 01:01:36.942
So that's kind of a way of
putting the whole thing

01:01:36.942 --> 01:01:37.960
together.
 

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.445
Now this is all very nice
theory that I proposed to you

01:01:42.445 --> 01:01:47.429
and you notice there's not too
many data slides that I put up

01:01:47.429 --> 01:01:48.510
for this.
 

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:51.139
It sounds great,
I'm sure you're all convinced;

01:01:51.139 --> 01:01:52.489
yeah that's a good answer.
 

01:01:52.489 --> 01:01:59.900
When you start looking at this
in more detail things don't turn

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.010
out to be so convincing.
 

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:07.996
One, about the cost of children
going up, which is the first

01:02:07.996 --> 01:02:11.630
part with children as a
consumption good.

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:14.420
Well what did children actually
need?

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.320
They need some clothing,
they need some food,

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.208
that's basically what they need
to stay alive and that's all

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.449
that they got in the old days.
 

01:02:23.449 --> 01:02:27.612
Well what's happened to the
price of clothing in the last

01:02:27.612 --> 01:02:28.949
several decades?
 

01:02:28.949 --> 01:02:33.329
No, the price of clothing all
around has fallen tremendously.

01:02:33.329 --> 01:02:36.139
Clothing with the new fabrics,
you can't wear them out at all.

01:02:36.139 --> 01:02:38.509
I have that problem,
I can't throw things away so my

01:02:38.509 --> 01:02:41.250
clothes just are all -- it's
very cheap, it's made in China,

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.969
Bangladesh, all around the
world.

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:45.420
The price of clothing has
dropped tremendously as a

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.871
fraction of income,
you always have to do that as a

01:02:47.871 --> 01:02:49.000
fraction of income.
 

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.137
The price of food has dropped
around the world as a fraction

01:02:52.137 --> 01:02:54.811
of income,
so the basic necessities of

01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:59.362
children have really dropped and
dropped quite drastically when

01:02:59.362 --> 01:03:02.739
you see a graph of that it's
quite drastic.

01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:06.856
If you consider the cost of
providing the same goods that

01:03:06.856 --> 01:03:10.460
pre-transition people provided
for their kids,

01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.974
if it's a cost to providing
that now has gone way down as a

01:03:14.974 --> 01:03:16.610
fraction of income.
 

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:21.148
As I said, often--usually
education is provided free by

01:03:21.148 --> 01:03:26.023
the government and sometimes
healthcare is provided free by

01:03:26.023 --> 01:03:27.619
the government.
 

01:03:27.619 --> 01:03:31.858
It doesn't look like an
economic issue that if you want

01:03:31.858 --> 01:03:36.490
to just have kids the way you
used to have them the cost has

01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:39.710
not risen but the cost has gone
down.

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:43.358
What has changed is in the
minds of people they now

01:03:43.358 --> 01:03:47.884
perceive that they must provide
for their children a completely

01:03:47.884 --> 01:03:50.550
expand--
different and expanded set of

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:51.969
goods than previously.
 

01:03:51.969 --> 01:03:56.222
Children have to have the kind
of education that they never had

01:03:56.222 --> 01:03:56.840
before.
 

01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.699
They have to have enrichment
activities, all kinds of stuff.

01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:03.983
If you read about China,
I mean it's amazing what

01:04:03.983 --> 01:04:07.949
Chinese--they only have one
child and that child is so over

01:04:07.949 --> 01:04:10.550
programmed it makes you look
lazy.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:13.360
I mean they go to dancing
lessons and music lessons,

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.400
and English lessons,
all after school,

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.659
the kids are just working like
crazy.

01:04:17.659 --> 01:04:20.050
You may have noticed near the
beginning,

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:21.690
but not at the beginning of the
previous lecture,

01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.550
a whole bunch of Chinese came
in and sat over there,

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.760
they were the Presidents of the
student--

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:29.614
I didn't know who they were,
they turned out to be the

01:04:29.614 --> 01:04:32.416
Presidents of the Student
Associations at some of the

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:34.409
really big universities in
China.

01:04:34.409 --> 01:04:38.384
So these are--to get to be a
top dog in a huge university is

01:04:38.384 --> 01:04:39.260
a big deal.
 

01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:40.809
What were they interested in?
 

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:44.389
This issue of modernization,
that they're spoiled,

01:04:44.389 --> 01:04:47.070
they realize that,
they were telling me--

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:49.586
I spoke to them later,
that they didn't want to have a

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:51.248
sibling,
they were really enjoying

01:04:51.248 --> 01:04:52.980
getting everything as an only
child,

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:54.349
and they did not want a sibling.
 

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.099
She's laughing because you know
that story.

01:04:56.099 --> 01:05:00.581
The other side of the coin is,
as the only child they have to

01:05:00.581 --> 01:05:01.329
succeed.
 

01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:04.856
They have to get top grades in
their education,

01:05:04.856 --> 01:05:09.380
so the amount of pressure on
them to work like crazy all the

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.599
time to study,
study, study is severe.

01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:15.143
They were interested
in--largely in the pressures on

01:05:15.143 --> 01:05:16.690
them which they were feeling.
 

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:19.507
I guess as Presidents of their
student body's they were

01:05:19.507 --> 01:05:22.376
probably overachievers like
crazy and so they would feel

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:23.889
this pressure enormously.
 

01:05:23.889 --> 01:05:28.097
Then you hear other stories
where kids learn to play this

01:05:28.097 --> 01:05:30.315
game,
so if a parent wants them--why

01:05:30.315 --> 01:05:33.061
don't you wash the dishes
tonight or help around the

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:34.650
house,
â€šÃ„Ã²oh if I do--if I take

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:37.599
time away from my studying,
I'll fail my course.'

01:05:37.599 --> 01:05:43.070
It's this change in mentality
that has raised the cost of

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:47.175
childrearing,
it's not the actual--that the

01:05:47.175 --> 01:05:50.400
actual cost of child raising.
 

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.360
If you raised them the old way,
that went way down,

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:57.092
but there's been a culture
change that's required an

01:05:57.092 --> 01:06:00.900
enormous increase in the
expenditures on children.

01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:04.443
Of course nowadays for you,
parents don't expect probably

01:06:04.443 --> 01:06:07.480
anything from you in return as
an investment,

01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.867
just to pay one year of Yale is
probably more than some Chinese

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.670
might make in their whole life.
 

01:06:18.268 --> 01:06:21.860
Now opportunity cost is another
interesting thing.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:27.559
We talked about the mother's
time, so as you remember,

01:06:27.559 --> 01:06:31.619
the cost of children is not
just what you spend in cash but

01:06:31.619 --> 01:06:34.840
it's the opportunity cost of
childcare time.

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:38.304
If you're out doing childcare
you don't have the option to

01:06:38.304 --> 01:06:39.518
also work at that.
 

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:43.637
Studies have shown that it's
actually the time cost of

01:06:43.637 --> 01:06:48.532
children that way outweighs the
direct cost of buying things for

01:06:48.532 --> 01:06:52.961
them and 70% of the cost of a
child is in the value of the

01:06:52.961 --> 01:06:54.750
time spent on it.
 

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:58.202
As people get richer,
yes, they buy more for their

01:06:58.202 --> 01:07:01.867
children and they buy more
expensive things but their

01:07:01.867 --> 01:07:06.027
earning power also rises and
it's this rise in earning power

01:07:06.027 --> 01:07:09.788
that makes the 70%--
so that 70% of the cost of

01:07:09.788 --> 01:07:13.570
children is the time they're not
spending working.

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:21.239
When the people go out and do
these time study things,

01:07:21.239 --> 01:07:24.139
I don't know how well you can
see this,

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:28.289
but this is the amount of time
that a mother spends in

01:07:28.289 --> 01:07:30.559
childcare for her children.
 

01:07:30.559 --> 01:07:39.449
If it's one child it's 2.2
hours a day and even up to 6--

01:07:39.449 --> 01:07:42.469
when they have 5 to 6 children,
the wife is not employed,

01:07:42.469 --> 01:07:44.869
so this is a stay at home mom,
it's 1.9 hours.

01:07:44.869 --> 01:07:47.545
There's really no significant
difference depending on the

01:07:47.545 --> 01:07:49.219
number of children that you
have.

01:07:49.219 --> 01:07:51.463
This is upstate New York in,
I think, the 1950s,

01:07:51.463 --> 01:07:53.896
this is fairly recent,
this is not even a developing

01:07:53.896 --> 01:07:54.469
country.
 

01:07:54.469 --> 01:07:56.909
The amount of time spent is
actually quite small.

01:07:56.909 --> 01:07:58.949
Now compare this to the mother
getting a job,

01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:02.460
she's--so people work 40 hours
a week,

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.717
say if it's 9 to 5 and if they
don't get paid for the half hour

01:08:06.717 --> 01:08:10.150
of lunch they can--
they work eight hours a day and

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:13.809
depending on how you do lunch it
can be 8.5 or 9 hours,

01:08:13.809 --> 01:08:16.154
and then they have to commute
maybe a half an hour to work and

01:08:16.154 --> 01:08:18.725
a half an hour back with--
getting properly dressed for

01:08:18.725 --> 01:08:21.448
the job and commuting and
actually getting there,

01:08:21.448 --> 01:08:26.060
so we're talking 9,10 hours a
day that a working mother,

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.408
in this case,
but it could be a father,

01:08:27.408 --> 01:08:29.750
is away from home,
so that's the cost of having a

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:32.511
job is like 10 hours,
the cost of having any number

01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:34.157
of children,
I mean seven to nine then

01:08:34.157 --> 01:08:36.644
something different is going on,
and remember it's only about

01:08:36.644 --> 01:08:37.430
two hours a day.
 

01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:42.988
The cost in time of children is
not really all that great,

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:45.841
and the only time it gets
bigger is if the child is less

01:08:45.841 --> 01:08:48.694
than one year old,
which it takes three or four

01:08:48.694 --> 01:08:51.090
hours a day to take care of
children.

01:08:51.090 --> 01:08:55.170
Now this is for all the members
of the family,

01:08:55.170 --> 01:08:57.690
this is just the mother,
this is all members of the

01:08:57.690 --> 01:09:01.095
family so again--
now this is 2.7 compare that to

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.476
2.2--
they have one child,

01:09:02.476 --> 01:09:05.213
it's a half hour,
the other members of the family

01:09:05.213 --> 01:09:08.359
together put a half an hour into
the child is 2.3,

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:12.212
this is a little bigger,
but it's never more than an

01:09:12.212 --> 01:09:16.520
hour a day put into the child
for all the other things.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.233
Again, it doesn't change an
awful lot with a lot of

01:09:19.233 --> 01:09:21.306
children;
later children are cheap

01:09:21.306 --> 01:09:24.939
because there's basically little
incremental cost to that.

01:09:24.939 --> 01:09:30.573
Here's more recent data and
this--the red line here is

01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:37.270
mother's childcare and this is
per week, this is not per day;

01:09:37.270 --> 01:09:42.171
it's something that starts out
in the 1960s and 1970s which is

01:09:42.171 --> 01:09:44.984
comparable to the data you just
saw.

01:09:44.984 --> 01:09:48.045
It was nine;
ten hours a week which is just

01:09:48.045 --> 01:09:51.716
a little bit over an hour a day,
and time goes on and I'll talk

01:09:51.716 --> 01:09:52.899
about that later.
 

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:57.715
It increases but it's very
small and here's the father's

01:09:57.715 --> 01:10:01.130
housework, it's like 2.5 hours a
day.

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:07.550
It's not--the amount of time it
takes to deal with children,

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.729
although our myth is that it's
very,

01:10:09.729 --> 01:10:12.858
very time consuming,
the actual fact when you take

01:10:12.858 --> 01:10:15.859
the data it doesn't really work
out that way.

01:10:15.859 --> 01:10:20.560
Now you have to be careful,
this is extra time,

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:25.252
so this--if you do house--these
numbers are extra time so even

01:10:25.252 --> 01:10:30.175
if you have no children it takes
a certain amount of time to take

01:10:30.175 --> 01:10:33.560
care of a house so that's a
fixed thing.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:36.265
Then all these numbers ask how
much extra time you're spending

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:38.927
if you have children,
so it compares people without

01:10:38.927 --> 01:10:42.402
children to people with children
and of course that's the proper

01:10:42.402 --> 01:10:43.670
number that we want.
 

01:10:54.979 --> 01:11:01.148
Here is an interesting thing,
so as this data gets more

01:11:01.148 --> 01:11:05.831
sophisticated,
you say well does childcare

01:11:05.831 --> 01:11:06.859
mean?
 

01:11:06.859 --> 01:11:09.788
When you take no children and
compare it to people with

01:11:09.788 --> 01:11:11.975
children,
but if you look differently at

01:11:11.975 --> 01:11:14.993
what the mother is actually
doing sometimes it's her primary

01:11:14.993 --> 01:11:17.109
activity,
she's actually doing the

01:11:17.109 --> 01:11:20.439
child--not really doing--
if anything else she's doing it

01:11:20.439 --> 01:11:23.673
secondary like watching TV or
washing the dishes so I know

01:11:23.673 --> 01:11:26.738
that's primary and that's an
hour and a half a day.

01:11:26.738 --> 01:11:29.543
If it's primary or secondary,
so she may be washing the

01:11:29.543 --> 01:11:32.814
dishes or vacuuming and the kid
is right there and she's talking

01:11:32.814 --> 01:11:35.359
to the kid and playing with it a
little bit,

01:11:35.359 --> 01:11:37.868
it goes up a little bit.
 

01:11:37.868 --> 01:11:41.042
But it's still--this is pretty
much the same number you've seen

01:11:41.042 --> 01:11:44.319
in the two previous slides so
there are a couple hours a day,

01:11:44.319 --> 01:11:46.743
this is again per day,
and the other slide was per

01:11:46.743 --> 01:11:47.090
week.
 

01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:50.515
If you just count the time
they're with the children at

01:11:50.515 --> 01:11:51.975
all,
they can both be watching

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.247
television together or they're
not really doing childcare

01:11:54.247 --> 01:11:57.577
they're just with the children,
it's still--it gets to be more

01:11:57.577 --> 01:12:01.710
significant but this is not time
taken away from anything else,

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.850
just the child happens to be
there.

01:12:03.850 --> 01:12:08.398
Now--and this is moderately
stable, it doesn't change

01:12:08.398 --> 01:12:11.458
between '65 and '98,
about the same,

01:12:11.458 --> 01:12:15.220
a little bit different,
about the same.

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:18.685
Now there's something
interesting that you might have

01:12:18.685 --> 01:12:20.220
missed in the slides.
 

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:25.734
I know I have to stop in a
minute, what happens between

01:12:25.734 --> 01:12:27.368
1965 and 1998?
 

01:12:27.368 --> 01:12:32.689
We're in the previous graph
between 1965 and 2003?

01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:36.163
Women go to work,
there's a huge difference in

01:12:36.163 --> 01:12:39.569
the number of women--
the fraction--either both the

01:12:39.569 --> 01:12:42.939
number and the fraction of women
working between any of these

01:12:42.939 --> 01:12:43.390
ages.
 

01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:45.069
Yet what do you see?
 

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:49.363
The amount of time that the
mother spends in childcare goes

01:12:49.363 --> 01:12:53.806
up from the total during this
period 9 to 10 hours up to like

01:12:53.806 --> 01:12:54.770
14 hours.
 

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:59.118
That as women go to work they
spend more time with their

01:12:59.118 --> 01:13:01.716
children;
part of the answer to that is

01:13:01.716 --> 01:13:03.859
this is in the rest of house
care,

01:13:03.859 --> 01:13:07.725
non-child house care,
and with modern gadgets and

01:13:07.725 --> 01:13:12.800
throwaway stuff that amount has
allowed women to spend more time

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.250
with children.
 

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.402
Again, all this goes to
contradict that part of the

01:13:17.402 --> 01:13:21.247
economic theory that says that
childcare competes with working

01:13:21.247 --> 01:13:26.800
and the evidence is very,
very skinny on that hypothesis.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:30.478
In fact, if you ask your
mothers or any woman that has

01:13:30.478 --> 01:13:33.810
children, what goes away when
they go to work?

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.260
Not childcare.
 

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:41.024
Leisure time and sleep;
survey after survey says that

01:13:41.024 --> 01:13:45.033
what women do differently when
they work is they get less sleep

01:13:45.033 --> 01:13:46.649
and less leisure time.
 

01:13:46.649 --> 01:13:56.100
I guess that's all we can do
today, see you Thursday.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.979
We may not continue on this
topic, I think you get the idea.

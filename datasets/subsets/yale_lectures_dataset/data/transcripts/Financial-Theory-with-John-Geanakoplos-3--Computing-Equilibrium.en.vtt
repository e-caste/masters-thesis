00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.943
Prof: Now,
the course, just to summarize

00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:06.097
again,
the course is the standard

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:10.167
financial theory course that was
made popular over the last ten

00:00:10.167 --> 00:00:12.860
years in a bunch of business
schools,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.706
and those guys who developed
this material basically thought

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:20.358
that markets were great and
finance was almost a separate

00:00:20.358 --> 00:00:23.066
part--
could be walled off from much

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.060
of economics.
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.840
So here at Yale we've never
taught finance that way.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.205
We've always taught it as a
part of economics and the crisis

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.579
recently,
I think, has made it clear that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.630
that's probably the way one
should really think about the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.230
problem.
 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.387
So it's become very fashionable
now to say that financial

00:00:39.387 --> 00:00:42.713
theorists had everything all
wrong and to ask how it is that

00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:44.630
they got everything all wrong.
 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.550
Why didn't they anticipate the
crash?

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.626
And the two standard critiques
of standard financial economics

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:56.710
are a) it didn't allow for
psychology,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.280
and you'll hear about that from
Shiller next semester,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.200
and b) it didn't take into
account collateral.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.100
And it was all done in a very
special case,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.959
a knife-edge case.
 

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:13.221
If you looked at it a little
more broadly you would realize

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:16.968
that the kind of crisis we've
had now is not such an

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:18.659
unfathomable thing.
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.720
In fact it's happened many
times before.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.080
So that's the perspective I'm
going to take in this class.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.400
So to put it a different way,
Krugman,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.610
very recently in the New York
Times,

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.590
you may have read his magazine
article,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.330
wrote exactly that,
that there are two problems.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.580
The financial theory has failed
us.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.680
Why has it failed us?
 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.480
Well, because it didn't have
psychology and it didn't have

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.120
collateral.
 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.226
And he didn't talk much about
the collateral which is

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:45.930
obviously something he's not
thought very much about before.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.477
But together with the
collateral he sort of said it's

00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:54.680
too much--how did he put it?
 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.610
He said, "Too much
seduction by mathematics.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.828
The financial economists were
seduced by their own mathematics

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:03.837
into believing stuff that a
sensible person who didn't pay

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:06.739
so much attention to mathematics
wouldn't do."

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.576
Well, although the critique in
this course is going to be

00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:14.482
partly based on collateral the
rest of what Krugman said I

00:02:14.482 --> 00:02:16.470
completely disagree with.
 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.038
I regard that as a kind of
Taliban approach to economics.

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:22.840
The more technology and
firepower you use the more

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.438
you're going to be misled.
 

00:02:24.438 --> 00:02:27.300
That's what the Taliban
believe, and they want to get

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.490
rid of modern technology and
return to first principles.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.132
So I think, in fact,
the problem with modern finance

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.292
was not too much mathematics,
but too little mathematics,

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:39.351
and they made these very
special simplifying assumptions

00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:42.633
and didn't realize how important
the assumptions were to the

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:43.580
conclusions.
 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.478
So we're going to reexamine all
that and that's what we're

00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:48.710
starting at now.
 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.078
We're going to consider,
first of all,

00:02:51.078 --> 00:02:53.830
the argument that free markets
work best.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.490
So we started with a little
example.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.206
Oh, by the way,
the first problem set,

00:02:58.206 --> 00:03:00.110
if I didn't mention it,
is due Tuesday.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.097
So you need to bring it to
class and there will be a box

00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:07.650
with each of your section
leaders' names on it.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.169
So supposedly you've been able
to sign up for sections by now.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.658
Is that right?
 

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:15.024
Anyway, it's on the web,
so you pick a section and sign

00:03:15.024 --> 00:03:15.550
up for it.
 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.490
If you wait too long your
section will fill up the time.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.840
So there are eight sections.
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.382
You ought to be able to find
one of them that fits your

00:03:22.382 --> 00:03:22.900
schedule.
 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.734
And you need to turn it in on
Tuesday in class,

00:03:25.734 --> 00:03:27.090
by the end of class.
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.050
Maybe you can scribble
something during the class,

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.558
but by the end of the class
we're going to take the problem

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:33.810
sets and after that it's too
late to hand them in.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.830
So all of you are going to have
problems,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.508
you're going to have midnight
sessions,

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:41.333
all night things that you're
going to have to do for some

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.377
other course,
or grandmothers are going to

00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:43.598
die.
 

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.694
All sorts of things are going
to happen, but we don't take the

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:47.710
problem sets late.
 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.729
So there will be ten problem
sets.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:54.232
We're only going to count nine
of the grades so you'll have one

00:03:54.232 --> 00:03:56.919
free pass, and that's what life
is.

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.276
And it's just too complicated
to keep track of people handing

00:03:59.276 --> 00:04:00.258
them late all the time.
 

00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:03.438
The answers are going to go on
the web right after the class,

00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:07.564
and so it's just in the past we
negotiated with every person who

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:10.250
was late and it's just too
complicated.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.729
And when you make a simple rule
grandmothers don't die anymore.

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.560
So anyway, that's how we're
going to work it in the class.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.930
You just have to turn it in.
 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.750
And there are ten of them.
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.829
Only nine count.
 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.076
If you miss one altogether it's
really not going to change your

00:04:24.076 --> 00:04:24.620
grade anyway.
 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.757
If you miss half of them that's
going to have some effect on

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:30.468
your grade, and so I don't
encourage you to do that,

00:04:30.468 --> 00:04:32.329
but I'm sure you won't do that.
 

00:04:32.329 --> 00:04:34.509
So I think that's all the
preliminaries.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:36.682
There are two midterms,
one in the middle of the class

00:04:36.682 --> 00:04:37.790
and one right at the end.
 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.216
Anyway, the question we want to
spend the whole of the class on

00:04:41.216 --> 00:04:44.699
today is whether the free market
is really such a great idea.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.899
And the quintessential example
in which it is a great idea is

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.259
the one we did in class on the
very first day.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.423
We had a bunch of football
tickets and there were buyers

00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:58.531
each of whom knew his own
valuation and sellers each of

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:02.098
whom knew her own valuation and
we threw everybody together and

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:04.629
just very briefly explained the
rules.

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:07.584
By the way, the only important
rule was--there were two

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:08.569
important rules.
 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:11.485
You had to announce publically
and loudly what price you were

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:12.019
offering.
 

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:13.170
That's very important.
 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.490
You don't have any secret deals.
 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.180
That would have screwed
everything up.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.084
And secondly,
we had a rule about once you

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:19.339
make a deal what happens.
 

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:22.120
How does the thing actually get
transferred?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.004
So one of the TAs stood by and
wrote it down,

00:05:25.004 --> 00:05:28.810
and the two people exchanged
the footballs and agreed to it

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.449
and walked off stage.
 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.899
So the actual mechanics of the
transaction to make sure that

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:37.348
the person turning over the
money actually gets the football

00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:39.632
ticket,
that of course is incredibly

00:05:39.632 --> 00:05:42.857
important and that's the thing
that gets left out often in

00:05:42.857 --> 00:05:43.480
finance.
 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.610
That's the collateral business
that we're going to come to

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.910
later.
 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.391
How do you know that the guy's
actually going to pay you what

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:48.970
he promises?
 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.194
Well, he's got to put up
collateral so that you can trust

00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:52.540
him.
 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.064
So without that there would
have been a big problem,

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:57.440
and we're going to come talk
about that later.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.845
In the old days when you bought
a stock someone on a bicycle

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:05.278
would carry the certificate from
one place--

00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:09.596
someone would carry the check
from one guy to another guy and

00:06:09.596 --> 00:06:14.127
then the bicyclist would get the
stock certificates and ride the

00:06:14.127 --> 00:06:16.069
bike back to the buyer.
 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.750
So it was one broker to another
broker.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.949
Sometimes it took a couple of
hours,

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:23.550
so there was a spacing in
between when the guy gave over

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.870
the money and when the guy got
the stock back,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.360
and you have to allow for that.
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.855
Maybe it would take a couple
days to process on everybody's

00:06:30.855 --> 00:06:31.199
books.
 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.940
So there's a thing called
ex-dividend.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.699
When you buy a stock the old
buyer continues to get the

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:39.899
dividends for a while--
the old owner--until a

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.817
particular date after which the
new buyer starts getting the

00:06:43.817 --> 00:06:45.810
dividends if there are any.
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.036
And everybody has to understand
that, because you have to allow

00:06:49.036 --> 00:06:50.910
for the actual trading
technology.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.721
So all those things are going
to come up later,

00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:54.690
and they were in the background
of this example.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.730
But never mind that.
 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.149
The point now is that these
people,

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:00.278
everybody just knew their own
valuation,

00:07:00.278 --> 00:07:03.920
not anybody else's valuation,
and chaos ensued,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.471
hardly any rules,
and miraculously almost

00:07:06.471 --> 00:07:10.428
instantly within less than two
minutes they figured out what to

00:07:10.428 --> 00:07:14.322
do and they managed to get the
football tickets into the hands

00:07:14.322 --> 00:07:17.129
of the people who liked them the
most.

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:20.459
And I'm going to just say that
slightly more mathematically.

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:25.237
You could model what everybody
did as having a utility function

00:07:25.237 --> 00:07:27.009
for football tickets.
 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.747
So the top person,
Mr.

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:33.214
44 gets utility of 44 for
having one ticket and tickets

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:37.350
beyond that don't give him any
extra utility,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.970
just still utility 44.
 

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.851
Similarly Miss 6 there at the
bottom she had utility 6 for a

00:07:43.851 --> 00:07:46.812
football ticket,
but there's also money in the

00:07:46.812 --> 00:07:47.800
background.
 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:53.668
So the welfare function
depended on the football tickets

00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.550
and money and was U(X) M.
 

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.589
So why does that capture what
went on?

00:07:58.589 --> 00:07:59.341
Because Mr.
 

00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:02.759
44, knowing that the football
ticket's worth 44,

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:05.274
he would say to himself,
"Should I get a ticket or

00:08:05.274 --> 00:08:06.439
not get a ticket?"
 

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:09.440
Well, if the price is under 44
the amount of money he gives up

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.293
and loses is going to be less
than the amount of utility he

00:08:12.293 --> 00:08:15.639
gains for the football ticket so
therefore he'll buy the ticket.

00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:19.663
So this utility function U(X) M
captures the idea,

00:08:19.663 --> 00:08:23.687
represents the goals of the
people involved in the

00:08:23.687 --> 00:08:24.920
experiment.
 

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.591
Each of them has a different U
of X, but all of them are of the

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:29.420
form U(X) M.
 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.674
And so the conclusion was of
the experiment and of the

00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:34.211
theory,
supply equals demand,

00:08:34.211 --> 00:08:36.625
the conclusion is that the
football tickets are going to

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.259
end up in the hands of the
people who like them the best.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:41.629
So what does that mean?
 

00:08:41.629 --> 00:09:03.893
That means that in equilibrium
the final allocation maximizes

00:09:03.893 --> 00:09:09.830
total welfare.
 

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.720
Now what does that mean?
 

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.317
Well, each person,
i, has a different utility

00:09:14.317 --> 00:09:17.307
function,
and so if you add up over all

00:09:17.307 --> 00:09:21.740
the people i you get the total
welfare of every single person,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.408
the economy's total welfare.
 

00:09:24.408 --> 00:09:28.672
I'm now about to prove--but it
should be obvious--that total

00:09:28.672 --> 00:09:32.788
welfare is maximized at that
equilibrium that you actually

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:34.740
found in class,
almost.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:38.019
There was just one tiny,
tiny deviation from the theory.

00:09:38.019 --> 00:09:39.870
Nobody made a mistake,
by the way.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.950
I think I mentioned this many
times.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:48.320
I've done this experiment
before and Mr.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.566
12 gets so upset that he can't
buy any ticket and he's standing

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:56.744
there embarrassed that everyone
else has traded and he's still

00:09:56.744 --> 00:09:59.690
sitting there with no football
ticket--

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.187
he ends up bidding 30 or
something to get a football

00:10:02.187 --> 00:10:02.629
ticket.
 

00:10:02.629 --> 00:10:06.509
Nobody made a mistake this
time, and so it happened almost

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:08.278
as the theory predicted.
 

00:10:08.278 --> 00:10:10.418
So let's just think of the
theoretical outcome.

00:10:10.418 --> 00:10:13.690
In the theoretical outcome
where the price is 25 and those

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.191
top eight people have it that
final allocation maximizes total

00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:17.879
welfare.
 

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:18.870
Why is that?
 

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.182
Well, whatever the money
distribution was you couldn't

00:10:21.182 --> 00:10:24.556
change total welfare,
because if i gives up some of

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:27.952
his money to her,
to j, the total amount of money

00:10:27.952 --> 00:10:30.361
is still the same,
and if you add up the welfares

00:10:30.361 --> 00:10:32.806
of all the people you're just
going to get the total amount of

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:35.009
money on the right and it won't
make any difference.

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.566
So therefore to maximize
welfare all you have to do is

00:10:38.566 --> 00:10:41.384
maximize the sum of--
you have to put the football

00:10:41.384 --> 00:10:44.070
tickets in the hands of the
people who want them the most.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:47.035
That's going to maximize
welfare, because that maximizes

00:10:47.035 --> 00:10:50.164
the sum of the U_i of
X's and rearranging the M's

00:10:50.164 --> 00:10:51.190
doesn't matter.
 

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.393
So we found in
equilibrium--that equilibrium

00:10:54.393 --> 00:10:56.330
maximized total welfare.
 

00:10:56.330 --> 00:11:00.412
So that was the original
argument for why equilibrium was

00:11:00.412 --> 00:11:01.870
such a great idea.
 

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.553
The greatest good to the
greatest number became

00:11:04.553 --> 00:11:05.428
mathematical.
 

00:11:05.428 --> 00:11:08.345
It maximizes the sum of the
welfare, so the sum utilities

00:11:08.345 --> 00:11:09.230
they called it.
 

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:15.480
That was the utilitarian view
of economics,

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.308
utilitarian view.
 

00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:22.860
And that's sort of the view
that prevailed in 1871.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.706
All right now,
they made one generalization

00:11:24.706 --> 00:11:26.448
from that--
we found before,

00:11:26.448 --> 00:11:30.759
which is that if you think of
not eight different buyers,

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:34.101
but one buyer,
or maybe two different buyers

00:11:34.101 --> 00:11:38.529
where the utility functions are
this concave function,

00:11:38.529 --> 00:11:43.006
so they're U_I(X) M
where U_I of 1 could

00:11:43.006 --> 00:11:47.408
be 44 and U_I of 2
could be 44 40 which is 84.

00:11:47.408 --> 00:11:51.426
That consolidated person would
behave exactly like the

00:11:51.426 --> 00:11:55.668
individual people who'd buy as
many tickets as they would

00:11:55.668 --> 00:11:59.080
collectively and so nothing
would change.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.412
The football tickets would
still end up in the hands of the

00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:02.778
people who wanted them the most.
 

00:12:02.778 --> 00:12:05.168
Maybe it would be one guy,
who held three tickets,

00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:08.442
instead of three different
people, but the tickets would

00:12:08.442 --> 00:12:12.011
still be in the hands of the
highest valuation holders and so

00:12:12.011 --> 00:12:14.750
you would get exactly the same
conclusion.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.087
One last lesson from that
example is that the price turned

00:12:19.087 --> 00:12:23.426
out to have nothing to do with
the total value of football

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:24.340
tickets.
 

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.739
The price turned out to be
equal, more or less,

00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:29.869
to what the marginal buyer and
the marginal seller thought it

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:30.600
was worth.
 

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.037
So Mr.
 

00:12:31.037 --> 00:12:34.389
26 and Miss 24,
they're the ones who controlled

00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:37.171
the price,
what 44 thought was totally

00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.490
irrelevant,
so that was why it was called

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.418
the marginal revolution in
economics.

00:12:41.418 --> 00:12:45.065
So Adam Smith who was so
puzzled because he said water is

00:12:45.065 --> 00:12:47.668
so valuable and has such a low
price,

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:51.154
and diamonds are so useless
really when it comes down to it

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:54.638
and they have such a high price
the answer to his puzzle is

00:12:54.638 --> 00:12:55.538
simply yes.
 

00:12:55.538 --> 00:12:59.628
Water, at the beginning Miss 44
would be 44,000,

00:12:59.628 --> 00:13:03.369
whereas if we had a same model
for diamonds,

00:13:03.369 --> 00:13:07.980
diamonds would also be very big
at the beginning.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.043
But the point is there's so
much water in the economy that

00:13:11.043 --> 00:13:14.105
the marginal value of an extra
gallon of water is not very

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:14.590
high.
 

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.678
The marginal value of water is
low even though the total value,

00:13:17.678 --> 00:13:19.672
which is the area under the
demand curve,

00:13:19.672 --> 00:13:20.519
is very high.
 

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:24.759
So that's the lesson that we
learned in the first class.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:28.639
And now we want to generalize
this to a much more

00:13:28.639 --> 00:13:32.105
sophisticated model,
but one you can still compute

00:13:32.105 --> 00:13:35.503
very easily,
and we're going to see how

00:13:35.503 --> 00:13:40.750
these special assumptions don't
quite work so well.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.808
Yes?
 

00:13:42.808 --> 00:13:45.590
Please interrupt me at anytime
with questions.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:48.808
Student: So could you
explain again how you said that

00:13:48.808 --> 00:13:52.083
the welfare function and the
utility function somehow involve

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:53.940
three or four people together.
 

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.509
Prof: Yes.
 

00:13:58.509 --> 00:14:03.785
So her question is--I said very
quickly which you'll see later,

00:14:03.785 --> 00:14:06.509
I pressed the button too soon.
 

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:09.726
If I press down and it's
halfway up does that just break

00:14:09.726 --> 00:14:10.778
the whole thing?
 

00:14:10.778 --> 00:14:15.837
Anyway, so her question is she
would like to know,

00:14:15.837 --> 00:14:21.826
again, why it is that I can
sort of combine people into one

00:14:21.826 --> 00:14:25.750
person and what do I mean by
that.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.091
So what I meant by that is if I
have two people,

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:29.303
Mr.
 

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:30.298
44 and Mr.
 

00:14:30.298 --> 00:14:35.009
40--I'm taking the buyers to be
hes and the sellers to be

00:14:35.009 --> 00:14:39.720
hers--I have two guys,
44 and 40, and I set any price.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.605
If the price is above 44
neither of them will want to

00:14:42.605 --> 00:14:42.940
buy.
 

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.285
If it's between 44 and 40 just
Mr.

00:14:44.285 --> 00:14:45.591
40 will buy [correction:
just Mr.

00:14:45.591 --> 00:14:48.472
44],
and if it's below 40 both of

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:51.442
them will buy,
but each of those guys is only

00:14:51.442 --> 00:14:52.769
interested in one ticket.
 

00:14:52.769 --> 00:14:53.092
Mr.
 

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:57.620
44's utility is U_I
of 1 is 44.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.190
U_I of 2 is still 44.
 

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.038
He doesn't get anything out of
a second ticket.

00:15:01.038 --> 00:15:06.543
Suppose now I had a third
person, a bigger person whose

00:15:06.543 --> 00:15:12.966
utility U_K of 1 is 44
and U_K of 2 is 84,44

00:15:12.966 --> 00:15:13.678
40.
 

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:16.559
So that person,
now, is a bigger guy.

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.379
He's interested in more tickets.
 

00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:19.620
That's what I mean by bigger.
 

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:23.576
He's going to behave himself
exactly the same way the other

00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:26.509
two separate people behaved
collectively.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:30.629
So if the price is above 44 he
won't buy either ticket.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:34.767
If it's 50 and he buys one
ticket he'll have lost 50 and

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:38.399
he'll have gained 44 in utils,
so he will have been worse off

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:40.389
than when he started,
and he certainly won't buy two.

00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:41.360
He would be even worse off.
 

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.720
If the price is between 44 and
40 he'll say to himself,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.775
this is the marginal
revolution, "If I buy the

00:15:48.775 --> 00:15:52.668
first ticket I pay 42 and I get
44 out of it,

00:15:52.668 --> 00:15:55.898
so I've gained two utils,
but now if I think about buying

00:15:55.898 --> 00:15:59.298
a second ticket for 42 and I
only get 40 out of it I'm going

00:15:59.298 --> 00:16:02.480
to start losing,
so I'll stop with one ticket.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.318
So that guy will behave exactly
the same way the two people

00:16:06.318 --> 00:16:08.565
separately behave,
so whether it's two guys

00:16:08.565 --> 00:16:10.808
separately or one guy together
it doesn't make any difference.

00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:13.110
Their total action's exactly
the same.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.346
And in the end the football
tickets have ended in the hands

00:16:16.346 --> 00:16:18.580
of the people who liked them the
most.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.230
Maybe I need a lot more water
than you do,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:27.149
but if I need it much more than
you do then all those gallons,

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:31.107
maybe the first twenty gallons
I drank I needed more than your

00:16:31.107 --> 00:16:35.196
first gallon and after that you
started needing water as much as

00:16:35.196 --> 00:16:36.649
I did,
something like that.

00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:41.158
So the tickets or the water
ends up in the hands of whoever

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:44.344
needs it most,
and it may be that there is

00:16:44.344 --> 00:16:47.918
more than one unit in each
person's hands.

00:16:47.918 --> 00:16:52.820
Any other questions before I
raise the thing again?

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.159
All right, so that sounds all
very convincing,

00:16:55.159 --> 00:16:58.230
but it's not going to turn out
to be quite so convincing.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.505
So let's try and generalize
this model to a more

00:17:01.505 --> 00:17:03.038
sophisticated thing.
 

00:17:03.038 --> 00:17:05.608
And so I'm following an example
which is in the notes.

00:17:05.608 --> 00:17:12.688
So you find that if you read
the notes--oh,

00:17:12.688 --> 00:17:15.890
so the textbooks.
 

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.224
Because the approach I take and
that we take a Yale is quite

00:17:19.224 --> 00:17:22.503
different than the standard
approach you're not going to be

00:17:22.503 --> 00:17:24.200
able to follow a textbook.
 

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.130
That's why I give you a whole
list of textbooks.

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.130
I encourage you to read them.
 

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:27.769
They're great books.
 

00:17:27.769 --> 00:17:28.568
They're famous people.
 

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:32.057
Most of them are quite good
friends of mine so I endorse

00:17:32.057 --> 00:17:34.310
them all,
but they're differently

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:38.202
presented than this course and
that's why you need to rely on

00:17:38.202 --> 00:17:39.890
the notes a little bit.
 

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:47.548
So let's just take this first
example.

00:17:47.548 --> 00:17:50.702
Suppose now that we have two
goods, but they're going to be

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:51.410
continuous.
 

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.474
You don't have to have just one
football ticket or two football

00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:54.970
tickets.
 

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.018
We have two goods which we're
going to call X and Y,

00:17:58.018 --> 00:18:00.288
and we've got two agents,
A &amp; B.

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:06.146
And so W^(A) of X and Y,
that's the welfare function

00:18:06.146 --> 00:18:11.773
like we had before,
is going to be whatever I had,

00:18:11.773 --> 00:18:15.220
100X - 1 half X squared Y.
 

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:19.711
And now the endowments of
goods, which I was a little bit

00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:28.230
fast and loose about before,
E^(A) of X, E^(A) of Y,

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:31.634
that's the endowment of A,
how much he has to begin with

00:18:31.634 --> 00:18:32.440
of X and Y.
 

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:37.598
I say it's 4 and 5,000.
 

00:18:37.598 --> 00:18:39.150
And then let's make another
person,

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:47.141
W^(B), his welfare function or
let's say his and her welfare

00:18:47.141 --> 00:18:52.558
function is 30X - 1 half X
squared Y,

00:18:52.558 --> 00:19:09.087
and her endowment E^(B) of X
and E^(B) of Y equals 80 and

00:19:09.087 --> 00:19:11.450
1,000.
 

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.284
So this is supposed to be
shorthand for an economy in

00:19:15.284 --> 00:19:18.160
which there are thousands of
people,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.932
millions of people,
every person characterized by

00:19:20.932 --> 00:19:24.180
the utility they get,
the goals they have over the

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.124
consumption goods,
and their starting endowments,

00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:30.244
and they're all going to be
thrown together and expected to

00:19:30.244 --> 00:19:30.730
trade.
 

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:35.761
Another example,
we can do another example,

00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:37.200
let's say.
 

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.855
We're going to work out both of
these, the same kind of examples

00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.710
you're going to the do in the
problem set.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:45.116
Another example,
I'm sorry I can't remember my

00:19:45.116 --> 00:19:45.950
examples.
 

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:54.740
I won't need to look at these
after I write the examples down.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:20:08.770
So another one is W^(C)(X,
Y) = 3 quarters log X 1 quarter

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:17.632
log Y, and E^(C),
the endowment of C,

00:20:17.632 --> 00:20:22.308
equals 2 and 1.
 

00:20:22.308 --> 00:20:31.740
And meanwhile I have another
person D of X and Y whose

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:37.078
endowment [correction:
utility]

00:20:37.078 --> 00:20:47.400
is 2 thirds log X 1 third log Y
and her endowment 1,2.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.150
And of course I could have had
an economy in which they were

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.713
all there at the same time,
but I'm just going to do two

00:20:52.713 --> 00:20:53.318
examples.
 

00:20:53.318 --> 00:20:55.788
So you see the economy consists
of many people,

00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:58.585
many goods maybe,
many people and each with

00:20:58.585 --> 00:21:01.778
different endowments and
different utilities,

00:21:01.778 --> 00:21:04.338
and if you throw them all
together what's going to happen?

00:21:04.338 --> 00:21:07.692
And so we have a theory now,
a theory of equilibrium that

00:21:07.692 --> 00:21:09.130
explains what happens.
 

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.675
And we can use a few tricks,
which I'm going to teach you

00:21:12.675 --> 00:21:14.362
now,
to actually solve concretely

00:21:14.362 --> 00:21:16.670
for what's going to happen in
each of these cases,

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.000
and it's very simple.
 

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.330
And the next step is going to
be to add finance to it and

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:24.365
financial variables,
but at the bottom we still want

00:21:24.365 --> 00:21:26.210
to have economic variables.
 

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.375
See here we've got the
consumption of two different

00:21:29.375 --> 00:21:33.048
goods X and Y and we want to see
what's going to happen.

00:21:33.048 --> 00:21:40.662
All right, so equilibrium is
always defined by turning things

00:21:40.662 --> 00:21:42.818
into equations.
 

00:21:42.818 --> 00:21:46.190
So we said the equations here
are going to be that.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:51.630
So what is A going to do?
 

00:21:51.630 --> 00:22:03.847
Well, the endogenous variables
are going to be P_X,

00:22:03.847 --> 00:22:09.346
P_Y,
X^(A), Y^(A),

00:22:09.346 --> 00:22:13.420
X^(B) and Y^(B).
 

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.009
That's what everybody has to
decide.

00:22:15.009 --> 00:22:19.156
In the end A has to decide,
the prices have to emerge for X

00:22:19.156 --> 00:22:19.730
and Y.
 

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.368
We're assuming,
again, that these people,

00:22:21.368 --> 00:22:23.568
by the way--I have one agent A
and one agent B,

00:22:23.568 --> 00:22:26.773
I really mean there's a million
agents just like A and a million

00:22:26.773 --> 00:22:29.776
agents just like B and they're
all shouting and screaming at

00:22:29.776 --> 00:22:32.318
each other and they're in some
kind of market.

00:22:32.318 --> 00:22:35.659
So if there's only one agent of
each type there'd be bargaining

00:22:35.659 --> 00:22:38.029
and threats and it'd be very
complicated,

00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:39.750
but with lots of people of each
type,

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.786
that's what I'm talking
about--so in our football ticket

00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:45.988
example there were sixteen
people competing with each other

00:22:45.988 --> 00:22:48.858
and you don't really need much
more than three,

00:22:48.858 --> 00:22:51.819
or four, or five on a side,
at least four,

00:22:51.819 --> 00:22:54.868
to get competition.
 

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:58.469
So with enough competition the
theory says the prices are going

00:22:58.469 --> 00:23:02.067
to emerge and people are going
to look at the prices and decide

00:23:02.067 --> 00:23:03.808
how much they want to buy.
 

00:23:03.808 --> 00:23:05.288
What do they want to end up
consuming?

00:23:05.288 --> 00:23:08.630
So A has to make his decisions
and B has to make her decisions.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.470
And so those are the endogenous
variables.

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:17.047
The exogenous variables were
all of the 80,1,000,1 half,

00:23:17.047 --> 00:23:21.509
1 times y, 100 times x,
all those numbers are

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:22.930
exogenous.
 

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.953
The utility functions,
the endowments,

00:23:24.953 --> 00:23:25.828
are exogenous.
 

00:23:25.828 --> 00:23:31.588
So these are all the exogenous
things.

00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:35.598
So the theory is going to say,
how do you go from exogenous to

00:23:35.598 --> 00:23:39.609
endogenous and it's going to be
just a bunch of equations,

00:23:39.609 --> 00:23:41.700
so what do they each want to do?
 

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:51.950
So A is going to maximize W^(A)
of X and Y such that,

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:56.380
as we said, the critical
insight, the budget constraint--

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:59.175
[clarification:
here, writes but does not say

00:23:59.175 --> 00:24:02.736
out loud P_X X]
P_Y Y is less than or

00:24:02.736 --> 00:24:06.486
equal to P_X times
E^(A)_X P_Y

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:09.667
times E^(A)_Y),
but we know what these numbers

00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:09.858
are.
 

00:24:09.858 --> 00:24:18.930
E^(A)_X is 4 and
E^(A)_Y is 5,000.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.920
So A takes it for
granted--theory says this,

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.704
it's very shocking--but it says
A takes it for granted that he

00:24:26.704 --> 00:24:29.558
can sell all his endowment if he
wanted to,

00:24:29.558 --> 00:24:33.805
4 units of X and 5,000 units of
Y and get the money from doing

00:24:33.805 --> 00:24:38.048
that and use the money to spend
on his final consumptions--

00:24:38.048 --> 00:24:42.579
let's call this X^(A) and
Y^(A)--

00:24:42.579 --> 00:24:45.380
of X^(A) and Y^(A).
 

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:50.318
So let's leave out the A's here
for a minute because those are

00:24:50.318 --> 00:24:52.019
the choices he has.
 

00:24:52.019 --> 00:24:55.170
He's wants to max over X and Y,
so there are many

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.220
possibilities.
 

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.680
It has to satisfy this budget
constraint.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:06.608
And similarly Y is going to be
maximizing over X and Y,

00:25:06.608 --> 00:25:12.086
W^(B) of X, Y such that
P_X X P_Y Y

00:25:12.086 --> 00:25:16.446
less than or equal to
P_X times 80

00:25:16.446 --> 00:25:19.490
P_Y times 1,000.
 

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.920
I think I remembered the
numbers finally.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:27.392
So, and now what we want to do
is we want to solve for these

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:30.875
variables so that when A,
taking P_X and

00:25:30.875 --> 00:25:33.710
P_Y as given,
maximizes his utility function,

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:38.428
he'll choose X^(A) and X^(B),
and B will choose Y^(A) and

00:25:38.428 --> 00:25:42.380
Y^(B) such that demand equals
supply.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:47.442
And so I'm going to write,
over here, maybe,

00:25:47.442 --> 00:25:50.150
demand equals supply.
 

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:54.472
So we know that in the end so
whatever these choices are

00:25:54.472 --> 00:25:59.190
they're going to lead to him
choosing X^(A) and Y^(A) and her

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.470
choosing X^(B) and Y^(B).
 

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:08.368
And it's got to be that X^(A)
X^(B) = E^(A)_X

00:26:08.368 --> 00:26:15.269
E^(A)_X which equals 4
80 which equals 84.

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:23.526
And it's got to be that Y^(A)
Y^(B) has to equal

00:26:23.526 --> 00:26:31.782
e^(A)_Y
e^(B)_Y which equals

00:26:31.782 --> 00:26:38.288
5,000 1,000,
which equals 6,000.

00:26:38.288 --> 00:26:39.509
I hope I've remembered
everything.

00:26:39.509 --> 00:26:42.868
So all right,
so those are two of the

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:43.990
equations.
 

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.296
Supply has to equal demand,
and now let's just do a little

00:26:47.296 --> 00:26:50.078
trick here to get some of the
other equations.

00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:51.750
A is going to spend all his
money.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.202
What's the point in not
spending money--because the more

00:26:54.202 --> 00:26:56.834
X he has and the more Y he has,
certainly the more Y he has,

00:26:56.834 --> 00:26:57.950
the better off he is.
 

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.298
So he's not going to waste
money.

00:26:59.298 --> 00:27:03.180
So this is going to turn out to
be an equality here.

00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:06.700
Okay, so that's actually an
equation, not just a variable.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:13.118
So P_X times X^(A)
(now the actual solution)

00:27:13.118 --> 00:27:20.266
P_Y times Y^(A) has to
equal P_X times 4

00:27:20.266 --> 00:27:23.900
P_Y times 5,000.
 

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.163
That's an equation,
and then similarly Y,

00:27:26.163 --> 00:27:28.259
she's not going to waste her
money.

00:27:28.259 --> 00:27:30.407
She's going to spend it all it
she's optimizing,

00:27:30.407 --> 00:27:32.098
so this will turn into an
equality.

00:27:32.098 --> 00:27:37.011
And so this will give
P_X times X^(B)

00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:42.246
P_Y times Y^(B) =
P_X times 80

00:27:42.246 --> 00:27:45.450
P_Y times 1,000.
 

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.037
So we've got four equations,
and now we have to do the

00:27:49.037 --> 00:27:52.490
marginal equation,
the crucial marginal equation.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:56.329
So what does that say?
 

00:27:56.329 --> 00:27:57.818
We talked about this last time.
 

00:27:57.818 --> 00:27:59.644
You've all seen it before so I
can go quickly,

00:27:59.644 --> 00:28:01.712
but this was the critical
insight that took years to

00:28:01.712 --> 00:28:02.200
develop.
 

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.710
Marx couldn't figure it out.
 

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.468
Until his dying day he was
trying to understand what these

00:28:06.468 --> 00:28:07.920
marginalist guys were doing.
 

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:15.301
So the idea is that if you've
optimized by choosing X^(A) and

00:28:15.301 --> 00:28:17.762
Y^(A),
if he's optimized choosing

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:19.827
X^(A) and Y^(A),
it has to be that the last

00:28:19.827 --> 00:28:22.198
dollar he spent--
he was indifferent between

00:28:22.198 --> 00:28:23.358
where he spent it.
 

00:28:23.358 --> 00:28:25.751
Otherwise he would have moved a
dollar from one thing to the

00:28:25.751 --> 00:28:26.318
other thing.
 

00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:31.827
So it has to be that the
marginal utility of X at X^(A)

00:28:31.827 --> 00:28:37.440
and Y^(A) divided by the price
of X, so what is that?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.759
What is the marginal utility of
X?

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:45.210
That's the derivative of X,
100 - 2 times 1 half,

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:59.700
100 - X, has to equal the
marginal utility to A of Y--

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:07.009
divided by the--sorry,
I meant to leave room here.

00:29:07.009 --> 00:29:15.118
Equals the marginal utility of
A of Y evaluated at X^(A) and

00:29:15.118 --> 00:29:19.930
Y^(A), divided by the price of
Y.

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:28.190
So that equals 1.
 

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.079
Marginal utility of Y is just 1.
 

00:29:30.079 --> 00:29:34.068
The derivative of Y is 1.
 

00:29:34.068 --> 00:29:36.828
And then we have to write the
same thing for B.

00:29:36.828 --> 00:29:47.137
The marginal utility of X for
X^(B) and Y^(B) divided by the

00:29:47.137 --> 00:29:49.410
price of X.
 

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:51.660
So what is for B?
 

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:58.940
It's (30 - X) divided by
P_X.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.650
Not very good board management.
 

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.367
Has to equal,
and this is also going to turn

00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:11.644
out to be 1 over P_Y
equals marginal utility of B of

00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:14.478
Y,
at X^(B), Y^(B),

00:30:14.478 --> 00:30:17.819
all over P_Y.
 

00:30:17.819 --> 00:30:19.390
So those are the equations.
 

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:22.858
Now, does that make sense to
everybody?

00:30:22.858 --> 00:30:24.828
I think I need to pause for a
minute.

00:30:24.828 --> 00:30:30.237
I'm going to do exactly the
same thing with that other

00:30:30.237 --> 00:30:35.848
system, but let's just see if we
can figure this out.

00:30:35.848 --> 00:30:38.630
So equilibrium is this very
involved thing.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.102
What everybody does depends on
what everybody else is going to

00:30:41.102 --> 00:30:43.614
do because how much should you
pay for something depends on how

00:30:43.614 --> 00:30:46.328
much you think you can get it by
offering it to some other guy.

00:30:46.328 --> 00:30:47.972
If there are a million A's and
a million B's,

00:30:47.972 --> 00:30:50.288
you're dealing with one of the
B's, maybe the other B will give

00:30:50.288 --> 00:30:51.108
you a better deal.
 

00:30:51.108 --> 00:30:53.253
So you have to think about what
the other people are doing

00:30:53.253 --> 00:30:54.910
before you can decide what to do
yourself.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.088
All that is captured by the
idea of the prices.

00:30:58.088 --> 00:31:01.013
Somehow people get into their
minds what the best deal they

00:31:01.013 --> 00:31:01.670
can get is.
 

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:03.420
That's the prices,
P_X and

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.220
P_Y.
 

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.416
Given those prices,
A, each agent,

00:31:06.416 --> 00:31:10.413
looks as his budget set or her
budget set and decides what to

00:31:10.413 --> 00:31:10.880
do.
 

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.068
And what should they do?
 

00:31:12.068 --> 00:31:16.069
They should equate marginal
utilities.

00:31:16.069 --> 00:31:17.440
That's the key insight.
 

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.163
The marginal utility per dollar
of X has to equal the marginal

00:31:21.163 --> 00:31:22.750
utility per dollar of Y.
 

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.241
That just says that the budget
set is tangent to the

00:31:26.241 --> 00:31:27.680
indifference curve.
 

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.900
That's what that says.
 

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.698
So you take the ratio of
marginal utilities--it equals

00:31:31.698 --> 00:31:32.858
the ratio of prices.
 

00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:35.641
And cross multiplying,
it says the marginal utility

00:31:35.641 --> 00:31:39.176
per dollar,
the slope of the indifference

00:31:39.176 --> 00:31:43.887
curve is marginal utility,
let's say, of X over marginal

00:31:43.887 --> 00:31:48.125
utility of Y and the slope of
the budget set is P_X

00:31:48.125 --> 00:31:49.680
over P_Y.
 

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.144
So if I just put the
P_X down here and the

00:31:52.144 --> 00:31:55.044
marginal utility up there that
just says the marginal utility

00:31:55.044 --> 00:31:57.990
of X divided by P_X
equals the marginal utility of Y

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.490
divided by P_Y.
 

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:04.338
That's something that you could
waste a huge amount of time on.

00:32:04.338 --> 00:32:08.576
I don't have to do it because I
know that you all have seen it

00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:12.535
before, and the one guy who
hasn't seen it before is going

00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:14.548
to figure it out himself.
 

00:32:14.548 --> 00:32:20.288
So we have a tremendous
advantage here.

00:32:20.288 --> 00:32:22.693
I can just skip over that
immediately and make use of that

00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:22.990
fact.
 

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.400
So that's the critical insight.
 

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.298
You've taken this incredibly
complicated system and reduced

00:32:27.298 --> 00:32:30.400
it to a bunch of equations which
you can put on a computer,

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.750
which is about--what I'm about
to do,

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:35.828
and solve it with a flick of a
button.

00:32:35.828 --> 00:32:41.710
So are there any questions
here--let me pause again--with

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:44.650
how I got these equations?
 

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.652
So it's a little bit
complicated, but of course once

00:32:47.652 --> 00:32:50.420
you've understood it it's not so
complicated.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.970
Now, who first thought of all
this stuff?

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:54.670
The amazing thing is,
incidentally,

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.720
these equations always have a
solution.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:32:59.772
If you take typical equations
in any field,

00:32:59.772 --> 00:33:02.898
physics, mathematics,
just random equations,

00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:05.588
they're not going to be
solvable.

00:33:05.588 --> 00:33:08.636
X squared 1 = 0,
that's just one equation,

00:33:08.636 --> 00:33:10.568
doesn't have a solution.
 

00:33:10.568 --> 00:33:13.426
And if you have simultaneous
equations why should there be a

00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:13.960
solution?
 

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.380
The economic system always has
a solution.

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:22.588
This is an astonishing fact
first proved by Arrow,

00:33:22.588 --> 00:33:26.605
my thesis advisor,
Debreu who did it at Yale as an

00:33:26.605 --> 00:33:29.646
assistant professor,
and didn't get tenure,

00:33:29.646 --> 00:33:32.970
and later won the Nobel Prize,
which has happened several

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:36.019
times at Yale--
Arrow, Debreu,

00:33:36.019 --> 00:33:41.757
and McKenzie all separately,
although these two guys ended

00:33:41.757 --> 00:33:45.250
up writing a joint paper,
anyway, they found that this

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.630
system always has a solution.
 

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.328
There's something special about
the economic system that has a

00:33:50.328 --> 00:33:53.029
solution that has to do with
diminishing marginal utility,

00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:54.490
which we're not going to talk
about in this class,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.130
but it's quite a fascinating
thing.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:00.728
And they based their argument
on an argument that Nash had

00:34:00.728 --> 00:34:02.180
given for games.
 

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:05.528
And this whole thing is very
related to Nash equilibrium.

00:34:05.528 --> 00:34:08.789
And I'm sure you've heard of
Nash and many of you have maybe

00:34:08.789 --> 00:34:11.219
seen the movie,
A Beautiful Mind.

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:15.697
Well, about five years ago,
a couple of years after the

00:34:15.697 --> 00:34:19.333
movie came out,
Nash is still very much alive

00:34:19.333 --> 00:34:22.440
and not quite as wacky as he
used to be,

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.780
and so the Indian Game Theory
Society opened.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.349
It was founded believe it not,
just five years ago despite all

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:33.340
the brilliant Indian economists.
 

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.110
The Game Theory Society was
founded about five years ago and

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.755
they had an opening conference
where six people gave talks

00:34:40.755 --> 00:34:41.969
including Nash.
 

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.018
I was one of the people who
gave a talk,

00:34:44.018 --> 00:34:47.280
and there were thousands of
people who showed up,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.530
mostly because of the movie,
I mean,

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.250
there was just thousands and
thousands of people.

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.945
So afterwards we went on tour,
traveling to a bunch of

00:34:55.945 --> 00:34:58.904
different cities,
and every city we went to we'd

00:34:58.904 --> 00:35:01.719
get off the train or the
limousine or something there'd

00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:04.797
be a throng of people there
waiting to meet Nash and there'd

00:35:04.797 --> 00:35:06.570
always be a press conference.
 

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.054
And after the press conference
there'd be a picture on the

00:35:10.054 --> 00:35:13.304
front page of whatever city,
and these were all great

00:35:13.304 --> 00:35:16.434
cities, a city we'd gone to,
and always there was Nash and

00:35:16.434 --> 00:35:18.760
everybody else was cropped out
of the picture.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.840
But anyway, in one of these
first conferences,

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.369
I'm just illustrating Nash
equilibrium here,

00:35:25.369 --> 00:35:27.715
somebody said,
some reporter says,

00:35:27.715 --> 00:35:31.507
"We've seen the movie,
but can you really tell us in a

00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:34.233
word what is Nash equilibrium,
competitive equilibrium,

00:35:34.233 --> 00:35:35.880
just say in a word what does it
mean,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.530
what does it mean for us?
 

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:42.654
And so each of us took a try at
trying to explain what Nash

00:35:42.654 --> 00:35:45.570
equilibrium was including Nash.
 

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.648
It didn't go too well,
the explanations,

00:35:48.648 --> 00:35:50.780
until they got to Aumann.
 

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.184
So he was also one of the
people who spoke,

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:55.590
and he subsequently won the
Nobel Prize.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.289
But anyway, at the time he
hadn't won it yet and he's

00:35:58.289 --> 00:35:58.809
Israeli.
 

00:35:58.809 --> 00:36:00.730
He's also a great figure.
 

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.378
And so Aumann says,
"That question reminds

00:36:04.378 --> 00:36:06.697
me,"--
I can't do his Israeli

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:09.976
accent--"that question
reminds me of the first press

00:36:09.976 --> 00:36:13.168
conference Khrushchev"--
who you might remember was

00:36:13.168 --> 00:36:14.639
Premier of the Soviet Union.
 

00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:18.152
This was in the time of Kennedy
and thumping the table and the

00:36:18.152 --> 00:36:20.559
Cold War and stuff--
"the first press

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:23.760
conference Khrushchev gave to
western reporters and somebody

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.134
said,
'Can you tell me in a word,

00:36:26.134 --> 00:36:30.112
describe in a word the health
of the Russian economy,' and

00:36:30.112 --> 00:36:32.780
Khrushchev says,
'Good.'

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:36.090
And then the reporter says,
'I didn't really mean one word.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.594
Take two words and tell us,
what is the health of the

00:36:38.594 --> 00:36:39.510
Russian economy?'
 

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:45.833
And Khrushchev says,
'Not good.'"

00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:51.942
So Aumann says,
"Equilibrium in one word

00:36:51.942 --> 00:36:54.572
is interaction,
in two words,

00:36:54.572 --> 00:36:56.409
rational interaction."
 

00:36:56.409 --> 00:37:00.146
So his definition managed to
get into the newspapers and none

00:37:00.146 --> 00:37:01.018
of ours did.
 

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:02.650
So that pretty much summarizes
it.

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:05.449
It's interaction,
but rational interaction.

00:37:05.449 --> 00:37:08.739
So, and it's captured by the
idea that everybody anticipates

00:37:08.739 --> 00:37:11.972
the prices and those prices are
going to really lead to the

00:37:11.972 --> 00:37:13.199
market's clearing.
 

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:17.786
So they're all anticipating the
right prices and behaving as

00:37:17.786 --> 00:37:21.518
optimally as they can,
choosing the best thing in

00:37:21.518 --> 00:37:23.230
their budget sets.
 

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:28.010
I put this on a computer and
solved it,

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:29.639
which we're going to do in a
second,

00:37:29.639 --> 00:37:32.199
but there's a trick to solving
this by hand,

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:35.135
so I might as well just do the
tricks by hand because on an

00:37:35.135 --> 00:37:36.248
exam,
for example,

00:37:36.248 --> 00:37:38.320
I'm not going to be able to
give--

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.360
you're going to use the
computer, it's very simple.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:43.230
You'll see in one minute you
can solve this on a computer,

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:48.233
but by hand it's worth knowing
how to do and you probably know

00:37:48.233 --> 00:37:51.260
how to do this,
but let me describe it.

00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:59.795
So the first thing to observe
is that the prices don't really

00:37:59.795 --> 00:38:04.349
matter up to scalar multiples.
 

00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:06.963
Walras, by the way,
was the first who made this

00:38:06.963 --> 00:38:07.590
argument.
 

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:13.460
So Walras was one of the
marginalists in 1871 from

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.780
Lausanne.
 

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.961
So he says, "Look,
doubling the prices isn't going

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:17.650
to do anything.
 

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:19.550
It's just like changing dollars
into cents."

00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:21.539
If you look at everybody's
budget set and double

00:38:21.539 --> 00:38:24.079
P_X and P_Y
you're doubling both sides of

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:24.800
the equation.
 

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.860
You're not doing anything.
 

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.969
So if P_X and
P_Y are part of an

00:38:27.969 --> 00:38:29.422
equilibrium,
2P_X and

00:38:29.422 --> 00:38:32.288
2P_Y will also be part
of the equilibrium because the

00:38:32.288 --> 00:38:35.154
prices only appear here in the
budget set and doubling them all

00:38:35.154 --> 00:38:36.309
doesn't do anything.
 

00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:45.103
So really you might as well
assume that P_X equals

00:38:45.103 --> 00:38:45.699
1.
 

00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:47.679
So he says, "Well,
that gets rid of one variable.

00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:50.771
You've got six variables and
six equations so you can all

00:38:50.771 --> 00:38:54.030
solve them, but there's so many
it seems too complicated.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:57.382
But now you got rid of one
variable, well you can also get

00:38:57.382 --> 00:38:59.559
rid of one equation,"
he says.

00:38:59.559 --> 00:39:01.170
So how can you get rid of one
equation?

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:04.909
Well, suppose we clear the X
market.

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:10.163
We find X^(A), X^(B),
Y^(A) and Y^(B) and

00:39:10.163 --> 00:39:13.032
P_X and P_Y
and all the equations are

00:39:13.032 --> 00:39:15.239
satisfied,
one through five.

00:39:15.239 --> 00:39:18.596
All these equations are
satisfied, one,

00:39:18.596 --> 00:39:22.659
three, four,
five and six are all satisfied.

00:39:22.659 --> 00:39:25.659
We haven't checked equation two
though, whether that market's

00:39:25.659 --> 00:39:26.510
going to clear.
 

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:28.659
And Walras said,
"Well, it has to clear.

00:39:28.659 --> 00:39:33.260
The last market we don't need
to worry about."

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.699
Why is that?
 

00:39:34.699 --> 00:39:39.969
Because if X^(A) X^(B) = E^(A)
E^(B) that means collectively

00:39:39.969 --> 00:39:45.148
all the agents are spending on
good X exactly all the money

00:39:45.148 --> 00:39:50.150
that they're collectively
getting by selling good X.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.753
That's what the top equation
says because when you multiply

00:39:52.753 --> 00:39:55.268
through the whole thing by
P_X the total amount

00:39:55.268 --> 00:39:58.143
people are spending on good X is
equal to the total amount agents

00:39:58.143 --> 00:40:00.119
are getting by selling all the
good X.

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:03.349
So since everybody's spending
all their money that must mean

00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:06.251
the rest of their money
collectively is just all their

00:40:06.251 --> 00:40:08.768
money they're getting from
selling good Y.

00:40:08.768 --> 00:40:13.530
They must be spending it all
collectively on buying good Y.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:16.099
That means the next equation
automatically has to hold

00:40:16.099 --> 00:40:19.152
because everybody spent all his
money so therefore all the money

00:40:19.152 --> 00:40:21.721
collectively that was spent on
good X equals to what's

00:40:21.721 --> 00:40:24.047
purchased [correction:
revenue received in sales]

00:40:24.047 --> 00:40:26.860
of good X because supply equals
demand for good X.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.552
So good Y it has to be that all
the people, the income that

00:40:29.552 --> 00:40:31.782
they're getting on spending
[correction; selling]

00:40:31.782 --> 00:40:34.570
good Y, all of that was spent
on buying Y collectively,

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:36.684
not any person,
each person that's selling Y

00:40:36.684 --> 00:40:39.289
and buying X or something,
but collectively all the money

00:40:39.289 --> 00:40:41.295
we've just deduced spent on
[correction: received by

00:40:41.295 --> 00:40:42.750
selling]
Y had to go to buying Y,

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.030
so therefore the Y market is
clearing too.

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:48.052
So once you've cleared all the
other markets you know that the

00:40:48.052 --> 00:40:49.389
last market has to clear.
 

00:40:49.389 --> 00:40:57.289
So without loss of generality
don't worry about last market.

00:40:57.289 --> 00:41:00.735
So that reduced it to five
equations and five unknowns,

00:41:00.735 --> 00:41:01.820
so that helped.
 

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:06.369
We got rid of one equation and
we got rid of one unknown.

00:41:06.369 --> 00:41:08.954
So we got rid of the top
equation, let's say,

00:41:08.954 --> 00:41:10.130
and P_X.
 

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.994
One of those two equations,
the market clearing equations,

00:41:13.994 --> 00:41:17.112
doesn't matter as long as we do
all the others,

00:41:17.112 --> 00:41:19.960
and one of the prices we can
fix at 1.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:23.931
So as we can fix P_Y,
let's say, at 1,

00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:27.480
we might as well fix
P_Y at 1.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.559
This becomes a much simpler
equation.

00:41:29.559 --> 00:41:33.739
This now I can replace with 1,
and this I can replace with 1.

00:41:33.739 --> 00:41:38.018
We already know what the price
is of Y, it's 1.

00:41:38.018 --> 00:41:43.818
But now things get very,
very simple because you have

00:41:43.818 --> 00:41:50.286
(100-X) over P_X = 1,
so I just write that again,

00:41:50.286 --> 00:41:54.190
(100-X) over P_X = 1.
 

00:41:54.190 --> 00:42:01.244
So I bring the P_X to
the other side and I have 100-X

00:42:01.244 --> 00:42:05.909
= this is X^(A)-- equals
P_X.

00:42:05.909 --> 00:42:13.550
Another way of writing that is
X^(A) = 100-P_X.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:23.150
Then from this bottom equation
I've got 30-P_X--30

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:26.730
minus--X^(B),
sorry.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.230
These are A's and this was B.
 

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.360
I forgot the superscript.
 

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.764
So (30-X^(B)) over
P_X) has to

00:42:35.764 --> 00:42:42.088
equal--well, the marginal
utility is 1 and the price is 1

00:42:42.088 --> 00:42:44.460
so that equals 1.
 

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.199
So I just have 30-X^(B) =
P_X,

00:42:48.199 --> 00:42:52.170
or, in other words I have X^(B)
(just writing this--

00:42:52.170 --> 00:43:00.309
bring it to the other side) =
30-P_X.

00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:01.449
So you look at the demand.
 

00:43:01.449 --> 00:43:02.639
This is what Walras did.
 

00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:04.858
He said, "Forget about all
these equations just look at

00:43:04.858 --> 00:43:06.739
demand and see where demand
equals supply."

00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:09.108
So here, given the price
P_X and P_Y

00:43:09.108 --> 00:43:11.518
we know without loss of
generality P_Y is 1.

00:43:11.518 --> 00:43:16.835
So given P_X this is
how much A is going to demand of

00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:17.179
X.
 

00:43:17.179 --> 00:43:20.250
And given P_X this is
how much B is going to demand.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:29.739
And we know in equilibrium by
that top equation that plus that

00:43:29.739 --> 00:43:32.539
has to equal 84.
 

00:43:32.539 --> 00:43:34.000
So now I can solve it.
 

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.451
So I know that 100-P--well,
I'm just going to solve it

00:43:39.451 --> 00:43:40.480
quickly.
 

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:50.755
So it's 130-2P_X =
84, which implies that

00:43:50.755 --> 00:44:02.469
46,2P_X = 46 implies
that P_X = 23.

00:44:02.469 --> 00:44:08.045
Once you have P_X =
23 then you can figure out what

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:13.193
X^(A) is,
because 100-X^(A) has to be

00:44:13.193 --> 00:44:22.159
P_X so that implies
that X^(A) is 23 and it implies

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:28.373
that X^(B) is--
no, X^(A) is 77,

00:44:28.373 --> 00:44:33.440
right, where is X^(A)?
 

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.380
X^(A) is 100-P_X,
so if P_X is 23 X^(A)

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.400
has to be 77.
 

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.829
It implies that X^(B),
I can do X^(B) from over here.

00:44:41.829 --> 00:44:48.027
30-P_X is 7,
and sure enough 77 7 really do

00:44:48.027 --> 00:44:49.340
equal 84.
 

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.010
So we've cleared the top market.
 

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.010
And now we don't have to worry
about the other market.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:55.559
We can figure out what X^(B) is.
 

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:56.889
How do we figure out what X^(B)
is?

00:44:56.889 --> 00:44:58.559
We go into this budget set.
 

00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:02.989
At a price of 23 he's going to
consume 77.

00:45:02.989 --> 00:45:04.210
That's going to cost a bunch of
money,

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.690
and this is how much income he
has,

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.530
and we subtract if off,
and P_Y is 1,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:09.239
we can figure out what Y is.
 

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:15.009
So we can figure out from this
Y^(A) and Y^(B),

00:45:15.009 --> 00:45:21.155
and we know that that's going
to clear the market,

00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:25.170
so we've solved the problem.
 

00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.980
But we can do this on a
computer.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.530
All right, so are there any
questions how I did this?

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.347
I'm going to do it one more
time with this model and then

00:45:34.347 --> 00:45:36.110
I'm going to do it on a
computer.

00:45:36.110 --> 00:45:41.108
And so this is the kind of
problem that hopefully will be

00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:45.750
second nature to you after you
do the problem set.

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:47.380
It's a very elementary thing.
 

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:48.369
Of course the first time you do
it,

00:45:48.369 --> 00:45:50.362
it seems very complicated,
but it's a very mechanical

00:45:50.362 --> 00:45:52.409
elementary thing,
but it's going to give us a lot

00:45:52.409 --> 00:45:54.530
of insight into the economy,
so any questions?

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:55.480
Yes?
 

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.114
Student: I was just
wondering what those two lines

00:45:57.114 --> 00:45:57.320
said.
 

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.750
I think the first word says
assume.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:45:59.590
I just can't read it.
 

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.771
Prof: Assume,
this says, without loss of

00:46:01.771 --> 00:46:03.480
generality that P_X =
1.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.829
Student: And the second
line?

00:46:04.829 --> 00:46:06.179
Prof: Except that I took
P_Y.

00:46:06.179 --> 00:46:07.489
This is P_Y not
P_X.

00:46:07.489 --> 00:46:11.570
P_Y = 1.
 

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:14.219
And the second line,
this one says,

00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:16.909
so without loss of generality
P_Y is 1,

00:46:16.909 --> 00:46:20.503
so having put P_Y = 1
here I then looked at these

00:46:20.503 --> 00:46:23.840
equations,
(100-X^(A)) over P_X

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.625
= 1 over P_Y,
but I took P_Y to be

00:46:27.625 --> 00:46:29.579
one so that's 1 over 1 which is
1.

00:46:29.579 --> 00:46:33.610
And I took this equation which
is (30-X^(B)) over P_X

00:46:33.610 --> 00:46:36.733
= 1 over P_Y,
so (30-X^(B)) over

00:46:36.733 --> 00:46:39.840
P_X = 1 over
P_Y,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.518
but that's 1/1 which is 1,
so I wrote that.

00:46:42.518 --> 00:46:47.389
So this is how I got my two
critical equations.

00:46:47.389 --> 00:46:50.918
These two equations here,
this and that,

00:46:50.918 --> 00:46:52.730
went down to this.
 

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:55.764
And then I just rewrote this
one as X^(A) is

00:46:55.764 --> 00:46:59.646
100-P_X and this one
you can write as X^(B) is

00:46:59.646 --> 00:47:01.130
30-P_X.
 

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.445
So 100-P_X,
30-P_X and then I

00:47:04.445 --> 00:47:08.519
added X^(A) to X^(B) and I got
130-2P_X = 84 and I

00:47:08.519 --> 00:47:10.039
got P_X.
 

00:47:10.039 --> 00:47:10.969
Yeah?
 

00:47:10.969 --> 00:47:13.510
Student: So we can set
P_Y to any number?

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:14.300
Prof: Any number.
 

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.550
Student: And get the
same results?

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:16.079
Prof: Yes.
 

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:17.170
You'll just multiply the pries.
 

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:19.927
If you set P_Y to be
2 you'd have gotten

00:47:19.927 --> 00:47:22.909
P_X to be 46 and you
get the same answer.

00:47:22.909 --> 00:47:24.849
Student: So they're like
relative prices?

00:47:24.849 --> 00:47:27.539
Prof: So the only thing
that matters is relative prices.

00:47:27.539 --> 00:47:29.380
So this is what Walras pointed
out.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.998
If you change dollars to cents
you're going to multiply every

00:47:33.998 --> 00:47:36.766
price by 100,
but the relative price of

00:47:36.766 --> 00:47:40.639
oranges and tomatoes is going to
be the same as it was before.

00:47:40.639 --> 00:47:44.690
So the theory only produces
relative prices.

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:45.570
Any other questions?
 

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:47.409
There was someone else raising
their hand.

00:47:47.409 --> 00:47:48.710
Nope?
 

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:51.385
All right, let's just do it one
more time so you see you get the

00:47:51.385 --> 00:47:53.679
hang of this and then we're
going to talk about why the

00:47:53.679 --> 00:47:56.184
market's so good and we're going
to see things are getting a

00:47:56.184 --> 00:47:57.630
little bit more complicated.
 

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.159
So let's do this one.
 

00:48:01.159 --> 00:48:11.768
This one is going to work--oh,
so I wasn't very clever here.

00:48:11.768 --> 00:48:17.510
Aha, maybe I could be clever,
more clever.

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:19.110
So how do we do this one?
 

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:20.769
Well, we have to write down all
the equations.

00:48:20.769 --> 00:48:22.469
So what are they going to be?
 

00:48:22.469 --> 00:48:25.172
They're going to be the same as
before, X^(A) X^(B) =

00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:26.992
E^(A)_X
E^(B)_X.

00:48:26.992 --> 00:48:28.706
[correction:
as pointed out later,

00:48:28.706 --> 00:48:30.786
should be X^(C) X^(D) =
E^(C)_X

00:48:30.786 --> 00:48:32.190
E^(D)_X].
 

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:36.693
That's supply and demand but
this is just 2 1 = 3,

00:48:36.693 --> 00:48:41.380
and over here we have--it's not
A and B any more.

00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:46.163
It's C and D,
I guess I called them,

00:48:46.163 --> 00:48:47.530
C and D.
 

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:58.929
And now we have for the second
one, we have Y^(C) Y^(D) =

00:48:58.929 --> 00:49:09.110
E^(C)_Y endowment of D
of Y = 1 2 = 3.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.460
All right, so that's supply and
demand.

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:12.889
Then we have to do the budget
sets.

00:49:12.889 --> 00:49:14.079
They're going to be simple.
 

00:49:14.079 --> 00:49:23.371
P_X times X^(C)
P_Y times Y^(C) has to

00:49:23.371 --> 00:49:31.849
equal P_X times 2
P_Y times 1.

00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:32.309
All right?
 

00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:38.039
And then budget set for D is
P_X times X^(D)

00:49:38.039 --> 00:49:43.228
P_Y times Y^(D) =
P_X times 1

00:49:43.228 --> 00:49:46.039
P_Y times 2.
 

00:49:46.039 --> 00:49:49.610
And finally we have to do the
marginal business.

00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:51.070
So what's the marginal business?
 

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.190
So somebody tell me this.
 

00:49:52.190 --> 00:50:03.849
So we need the marginal utility
of A over the price of X.

00:50:03.849 --> 00:50:04.469
What's that?
 

00:50:04.469 --> 00:50:09.849
What's the marginal utility of
X to Mr. A?

00:50:09.849 --> 00:50:11.159
Student: 3 fourths X.
 

00:50:11.159 --> 00:50:12.679
Prof: 3 fourths what?
 

00:50:12.679 --> 00:50:14.659
Student: X.
 

00:50:14.659 --> 00:50:17.454
Prof: That's what you
said 3 fourths X,

00:50:17.454 --> 00:50:19.690
exactly, divided by
P_X.

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.530
So how did I do that?
 

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.840
I took the derivative of 3
fourths times log X.

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:24.030
This is the only thing you have
to know.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.400
The derivative of log X is 1
over X,

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.987
and that's going to be equal to
the marginal utility of

00:50:30.987 --> 00:50:33.364
[clarification:
at the point]

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:37.802
X_A,
Y_A with respect to Y

00:50:37.802 --> 00:50:41.900
over P_Y and that's
equal to what?

00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:43.530
Student: 1 fourth Y.
 

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:48.119
Prof: 1 fourth Y.
 

00:50:48.119 --> 00:50:50.219
Student: Are your A's
C's?

00:50:50.219 --> 00:50:51.590
Prof: Yes,
my A's are C's.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:52.119
Thank you.
 

00:50:52.119 --> 00:50:57.079
I'm glad you pointed that out.
 

00:50:57.079 --> 00:50:58.420
Thanks.
 

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.556
So it's embarrassing to make
all these mistakes,

00:51:00.556 --> 00:51:03.056
but you'll find in 30 years
you'll start making mistakes

00:51:03.056 --> 00:51:03.420
too.
 

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:09.288
So that's that equation and
then we have to do the same

00:51:09.288 --> 00:51:10.809
thing for Y.
 

00:51:10.809 --> 00:51:12.827
And I should have been more
clever and left more room,

00:51:12.827 --> 00:51:13.400
but I didn't.
 

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.489
But anyway, the last equation
is going to be marginal utility.

00:51:16.489 --> 00:51:17.710
So what is the last equation?
 

00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:30.268
Marginal utility of D,
of X, over P_X =

00:51:30.268 --> 00:51:32.099
what?
 

00:51:32.099 --> 00:51:37.230
2 thirds times 1 over Y
[correction: X]

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.820
divided by P_X =
what?

00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:45.639
I'm not going to write out
marginal utility of -Y over

00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:47.369
P_Y is what?
 

00:51:47.369 --> 00:51:50.059
Student:
&gt;

00:51:50.059 --> 00:51:52.402
Prof: [1 third times 1
over]

00:51:52.402 --> 00:51:55.159
Y^(D), [all]
divided by P_Y.

00:51:55.159 --> 00:51:56.920
So those are the equations.
 

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.096
So now we're going to put these
on a computer,

00:52:01.096 --> 00:52:06.478
but we can solve these by hand
again, and were going to see

00:52:06.478 --> 00:52:10.469
it's very useful to be able to
do this.

00:52:10.469 --> 00:52:17.500
Almost, so there's another
trick to doing this.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:21.150
So the trick is we can take one
of them to be 1,

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:23.170
whichever we want to do.
 

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:27.699
Take P_Y to be 1 or
P_X to be 1.

00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:30.940
So take P_X = 1.
 

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:33.650
Here you see things are a
little bit more symmetric.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.141
There, there was the special Y
that had constant margin utility

00:52:37.141 --> 00:52:39.619
just like in our football
tickets example.

00:52:39.619 --> 00:52:41.679
Here there's nothing that is
constant marginal utility.

00:52:41.679 --> 00:52:44.030
X and Y are much more symmetric.
 

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:47.827
So this move to more symmetry
without the special X if very

00:52:47.827 --> 00:52:50.161
important,
and the guy who first did that

00:52:50.161 --> 00:52:53.123
was actually Irving Fisher at
Yale who you're going to hear a

00:52:53.123 --> 00:52:54.260
lot about very soon.
 

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:59.460
So it's a little bit more
complicated this time.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:06.170
So here's the critical
equation, this one let's say.

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:10.559
So now I'm going to solve this.
 

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.710
So how can I do this?
 

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.469
I want to do the same trick as
before.

00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:19.349
I now want to solve--so let's
take P_Y to be 1 like

00:53:19.349 --> 00:53:22.130
I did before,
take P_Y to be 1.

00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:28.429
So let's just solve this
equation, solve for X.

00:53:28.429 --> 00:53:36.480
It's not going to be so easy to
do this.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.530
So now there's a tremendous
trick here.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:48.920
What does this say if I rewrite
this?

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:53.590
I can bring the X down here and
I get P_X times X.

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:58.539
And I can bring the Y down here
and I get P_Y times Y.

00:53:58.539 --> 00:54:02.391
So it says that the amount you
spend on X relative to 3

00:54:02.391 --> 00:54:06.530
quarters is equal to the
amount--this is by the way Mr.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:11.246
C--the amount C spends on X
relative to 3 quarters is equal

00:54:11.246 --> 00:54:15.639
to the amount he spends on Y
relative to 1 quarter,

00:54:15.639 --> 00:54:20.659
but the total spending on X and
Y has got to be all his income.

00:54:20.659 --> 00:54:25.005
So basically it says that he
spends 3 quarters of his income

00:54:25.005 --> 00:54:26.920
on X and 1 quarter on Y.
 

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.980
That's the crucial insight.
 

00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.360
So you can solve these
logarithmic examples very easily

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.659
by that trick.
 

00:54:34.659 --> 00:54:48.509
So it's evident from marginal
utility equation that C will

00:54:48.509 --> 00:55:03.331
spend 3 quarters of his income
on X, and D will spend 2 thirds

00:55:03.331 --> 00:55:08.920
of her income on X.
 

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.320
By the same argument she's
going to have 2 thirds--

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:17.059
I can bring X^(D) down and her
spending on X relative to 2

00:55:17.059 --> 00:55:22.050
thirds is equal to her spending
on Y relative to 1 third,

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:24.380
but she's spending all her
income on X and Y.

00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:29.242
So clearly 2 thirds of it is
being spent on X and 1 third of

00:55:29.242 --> 00:55:29.820
it Y.
 

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:35.900
So that property of the log
utilities is no accident.

00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.349
They were invented for exactly
that purpose.

00:55:38.349 --> 00:55:39.960
So this is a story you probably
heard,

00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.539
but there is a famous--I'm from
Illinois--

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:45.949
there was a famous Senator
Douglas from Illinois,

00:55:45.949 --> 00:55:47.949
there have been several
Douglas' from Illinois.

00:55:47.949 --> 00:55:52.210
One of them debated Lincoln.
 

00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:54.670
Maybe he wasn't from Illinois.
 

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:55.940
Lincoln was from Illinois.
 

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:59.483
There was a famous senator
named Douglas from Illinois

00:55:59.483 --> 00:56:03.028
after the Civil War and he
noticed that farmers' labor

00:56:03.028 --> 00:56:06.840
tended to get 2 thirds or 3
quarters of all the income and

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.380
capital the rest.
 

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:11.480
So he said, "What kind of
utility function would make me

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:14.425
always spend the same fraction
of my money on a particular

00:56:14.425 --> 00:56:15.199
good."
 

00:56:15.199 --> 00:56:18.440
And so he went to his college
math teacher,

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:22.172
Cobb, and asked him if he could
invent a utility function which

00:56:22.172 --> 00:56:26.025
had the property that you always
spent a fixed proportion of your

00:56:26.025 --> 00:56:28.644
money on each good,
and so Cobb invented the

00:56:28.644 --> 00:56:31.340
Cobb-Douglas utility function
and this is where it is.

00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:34.679
This is just the sum of logs.
 

00:56:34.679 --> 00:56:37.920
So it's called Cobb-Douglas
utility.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.239
So it has that property,
this property,

00:56:39.239 --> 00:56:42.423
that each person in this
Cobb-Douglas utility spends a

00:56:42.423 --> 00:56:45.670
fixed proportion of her money on
each of the goods,

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:47.909
a different proportion on each
of the goods and different

00:56:47.909 --> 00:56:49.389
people have different
proportions,

00:56:49.389 --> 00:56:52.552
but any single person can
always spend a given proportion

00:56:52.552 --> 00:56:54.699
3 quarters on X and 1 quarter on
Y,

00:56:54.699 --> 00:56:56.730
2 thirds on X, 1 quarter on Y.
 

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.989
And because of that it's very
easy to solve for equilibrium.

00:56:59.989 --> 00:57:03.190
So we go, X^(A) is going to be
3 quarters.

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.380
What is her income?
 

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:17.309
Her income is P_X
times 2 P_Y times 1.

00:57:17.309 --> 00:57:18.730
So her income has to be that.
 

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:23.271
She's going to spend 3 quarters
of her income on X,

00:57:23.271 --> 00:57:26.269
so I could write X^(A) as that.
 

00:57:26.269 --> 00:57:27.530
So this is C.
 

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:35.599
And X^(D) is going to be,
she's spending 2 thirds of her

00:57:35.599 --> 00:57:44.405
income on X and 1 third on Y,
so her endowments are 1 unit of

00:57:44.405 --> 00:57:47.780
X and 2 units of Y.
 

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.175
So this is her income,
P_X times 1

00:57:50.175 --> 00:57:53.445
P_Y times 2,
and so she's spending 2 thirds

00:57:53.445 --> 00:57:56.699
of it on X so therefore
P_X times X^(D),

00:57:56.699 --> 00:57:58.760
that's the amount of money she
spends on X,

00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:00.989
that's what she spends on X,
has to be that,

00:58:00.989 --> 00:58:02.880
so X^(D) is that.
 

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:09.659
And if I add these two,
when I add them up I have to

00:58:09.659 --> 00:58:11.519
get 2 1 = 3.
 

00:58:11.519 --> 00:58:14.179
So I can just now solve this.
 

00:58:14.179 --> 00:58:18.083
Well, I can do a trick and pick
one of my--either P_X

00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:20.730
or P_Y to be 1,
so either one.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:21.809
I keep going back and forth.
 

00:58:21.809 --> 00:58:22.750
It doesn't make any difference.
 

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:27.429
Let's try P_Y as 1,
can take that to be 1.

00:58:27.429 --> 00:58:28.659
And now I can solve it.
 

00:58:28.659 --> 00:58:42.896
So this is just 3 quarters,
times (P_X times 2 1

00:58:42.896 --> 00:58:49.639
divided by P_X.
 

00:58:49.639 --> 00:58:56.916
Then the other one is 2 thirds
(P_X times 1 2)

00:58:56.916 --> 00:59:00.489
divided by P_X.
 

00:59:00.489 --> 00:59:05.806
So I can add those,
and when I add those it equals

00:59:05.806 --> 00:59:06.239
3.
 

00:59:06.239 --> 00:59:11.367
So I know that 3P_X,
if I multiply through by

00:59:11.367 --> 00:59:16.018
P_X I get
3P_X = 3 halves--

00:59:16.018 --> 00:59:17.860
hopefully I did this right--3
halves P_X--

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.340
this'll be very embarrassing if
I didn't--

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:30.610
3 halves P_X 3
quarters 2 thirds P_X

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:35.840
4 thirds = 3P_X.
 

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.320
Oh, is this right?
 

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.119
So who can do this in their
heads?

00:59:42.119 --> 00:59:47.996
3 halves P_X from
that is 3 halves P_X,

00:59:47.996 --> 00:59:53.467
so 3 halves - 2 thirds,
3 halves is 9 sixths - 4 sixths

00:59:53.467 --> 00:59:55.090
is 5 sixths.
 

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:59.090
It looks like 5 sixths
P_X.

00:59:59.090 --> 01:00:00.889
Does anyone believe that?
 

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:06.523
If I do this in terms of 6
that's 9 sixths and that's 4

01:00:06.523 --> 01:00:11.217
over 6, that's 13 over 6 and
that's 18 over 6,

01:00:11.217 --> 01:00:14.869
so it's 5 over 6 P_X.
 

01:00:14.869 --> 01:00:21.681
That looks right,
and 3 quarters 4 thirds if I go

01:00:21.681 --> 01:00:29.768
to 12ths that's 9 twelfths and
16 twelfths is 25 twelfths,

01:00:29.768 --> 01:00:34.309
so this looks like 5 halves.
 

01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:38.449
So that means P_X = 5
halves.

01:00:38.449 --> 01:00:42.889
So there I've got the answer.
 

01:00:42.889 --> 01:00:46.840
Does that look right to you?
 

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.650
Is this clear what I did here?
 

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:57.222
I just took for this trick all
I did was I solved for--so let's

01:00:57.222 --> 01:01:00.679
just repeat what I did.
 

01:01:00.679 --> 01:01:03.954
Just like over there I reduced
it to simultaneous equations in

01:01:03.954 --> 01:01:05.757
a mechanical way,
in a very simple

01:01:05.757 --> 01:01:08.391
straightforward mechanical way
which the first time you see

01:01:08.391 --> 01:01:11.476
looks very complicated,
but it's very simple,

01:01:11.476 --> 01:01:14.659
in fact, after you've done it
once.

01:01:14.659 --> 01:01:17.186
Then it allows you to take
these very complicated models

01:01:17.186 --> 01:01:18.518
and say something concrete.
 

01:01:18.518 --> 01:01:20.927
So I've got all the
peoples'--their welfare

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.820
functions and their endowments.
 

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.409
So I say in equilibrium what
has to happen.

01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:28.724
Whatever they decide to eat C
and D what he eats plus what she

01:01:28.724 --> 01:01:30.409
eats has to be the endowment.
 

01:01:30.409 --> 01:01:32.039
The total endowment is 3.
 

01:01:32.039 --> 01:01:34.829
So the total consumption of X
has to be 3.

01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:38.021
The total consumption of Y
between what he eats and what

01:01:38.021 --> 01:01:39.880
she eats also has to be three.
 

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:42.250
Now each of them is going to
spend all their money.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.489
He's going to spend all his
money.

01:01:43.489 --> 01:01:45.768
She's going to spend all her
money.

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:49.230
Because it's Cobb-Douglas,
because it's logarithmic,

01:01:49.230 --> 01:01:52.309
and you do this marginal
utility stuff you find out,

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:56.277
and this was the only trick,
so this is a non-obvious trick

01:01:56.277 --> 01:01:59.833
which some senator and
professional mathematician had

01:01:59.833 --> 01:02:02.757
to invent,
Cobb-Douglas is designed so

01:02:02.757 --> 01:02:06.974
that you can say right away with
those utility functions D is

01:02:06.974 --> 01:02:11.050
clearly going to spend 2 thirds
of her money buying X,

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:15.730
and C is going to spend 3
quarters of his money buying X.

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.018
It's just obvious from the
first order conditions,

01:02:18.018 --> 01:02:19.699
from this marginal utility
conditions,

01:02:19.699 --> 01:02:21.000
they're called first order
conditions,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.059
from this equating marginal
utilities.

01:02:23.059 --> 01:02:24.849
That was the crucial trick.
 

01:02:24.849 --> 01:02:28.871
So that's a trick that you have
to internalize and from now on

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:33.090
that's all you have to know that
C's going to spend 3 quarters of

01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:36.094
his money on X,
1 quarter of his money on Y and

01:02:36.094 --> 01:02:39.630
D's going to spend 2 thirds of
her money on X and 1 third on Y,

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:41.130
but supply has to equal demand.
 

01:02:41.130 --> 01:02:42.400
So what is C?
 

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.719
What is he actually buying?
 

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.469
Here's his total money.
 

01:02:45.469 --> 01:02:47.840
He has two units of X and one
unit of Y.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.795
So he's selling his units of X
at the price P_X,

01:02:50.795 --> 01:02:53.128
and his units of Y at the price
P_Y,

01:02:53.128 --> 01:02:55.409
and he's spending 3 quarters of
it on X.

01:02:55.409 --> 01:02:57.780
So how much X is he actually
buying?

01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:00.018
This is the amount of money
he's spending on X.

01:03:00.018 --> 01:03:02.855
Divide by the price of
P_X,

01:03:02.855 --> 01:03:05.768
that's how much money he buys
of X.

01:03:05.768 --> 01:03:08.907
She, D, she's going to spend,
here's her income which is not

01:03:08.907 --> 01:03:11.353
quite the same as his,
because her endowment is

01:03:11.353 --> 01:03:13.110
different, that's her income.
 

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:16.940
She spends 2 thirds of it on X,
so the amount of X she wants to

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:20.461
buy is the amount of money she
spends on it divided by the

01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.079
price.
 

01:03:21.079 --> 01:03:22.809
That's how much she wants to
buy.

01:03:22.809 --> 01:03:27.079
Now I just have to add X^(C)
X^(D) and it's very hard for me

01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:30.409
to do at the board and you to
follow there,

01:03:30.409 --> 01:03:34.041
but of course if you stare at
the page for a minute at home

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:36.110
it'll be very simple to follow.
 

01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:38.449
I do Walras' trick.
 

01:03:38.449 --> 01:03:41.190
I said I can always take
P_Y to be 1,

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:43.938
and if I take P_Y to
be 1 I'm going to get this

01:03:43.938 --> 01:03:46.443
income is P_X [times]
2 times [correction:

01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:48.260
plus]
1 times 1 which is just 1,

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.010
so 3 quarters of this divided
by P_X,

01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:51.389
that's what he's buying.
 

01:03:51.389 --> 01:03:55.123
She's buying 2 thirds of her
income which is P_X

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.679
times 1 1 times 2 which is plus
two,

01:03:57.679 --> 01:03:59.989
divided by P_X,
that's what she's buying,

01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:04.199
and I just add this to this and
do a little algebra.

01:04:04.199 --> 01:04:07.231
So I just add and do a little
algebra and lo and behold

01:04:07.231 --> 01:04:09.309
P_X is equal to 5
halves.

01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:11.463
So I happened to remember
that's the right number so I

01:04:11.463 --> 01:04:12.518
actually did this right.
 

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:15.481
So P_X is equal to 5
halves, and we've solved the

01:04:15.481 --> 01:04:16.300
whole problem.
 

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:24.324
So if P_X is equal to
5 halves how much is she

01:04:24.324 --> 01:04:27.679
actually buying of X?
 

01:04:27.679 --> 01:04:29.760
Well, I could always plug this
back in,

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.182
plug in P_X is equal
to 5 halves and find out that's

01:04:35.182 --> 01:04:37.081
5 1 is 6,
times 3 quarters,

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:38.110
divided by 5 halves.
 

01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:42.010
That would tell me how much
X_C she was buying.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:46.728
So and I could plug in 5 halves
for P_X and I'd get

01:04:46.728 --> 01:04:51.682
how much D was buying of X and I
could also plug P_X =

01:04:51.682 --> 01:04:56.177
5 halves and PY = 1,
and find out what they were

01:04:56.177 --> 01:04:57.768
doing of good D.
 

01:04:57.768 --> 01:05:00.795
So you can solve it by hand
very easily, but let's just

01:05:00.795 --> 01:05:03.989
solve it by computer instead
unless there's a question.

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:06.360
Ha, I stopped it.
 

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:07.869
Any questions about what I did
here?

01:05:07.869 --> 01:05:08.710
Yes?
 

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:12.536
Student: So we just
maximized utility so there's no

01:05:12.536 --> 01:05:15.489
other allocation of utilities
any greater?

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:19.739
Prof: Well,
now we haven't gotten here yet.

01:05:19.739 --> 01:05:23.025
I've run over a little bit,
so I'm going to finish the

01:05:23.025 --> 01:05:26.311
class by repeating this
calculation on a computer just

01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:29.969
by pressing a button and you'll
see what the answer is.

01:05:29.969 --> 01:05:33.193
But then we have to examine the
question, have we really

01:05:33.193 --> 01:05:36.065
maximized utility here,
and to give away the punch

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.409
line, that utility was very
special.

01:05:38.409 --> 01:05:41.818
It was constant marginal
utility of 1 in a particular

01:05:41.818 --> 01:05:42.409
good Y.
 

01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:45.206
That's what made this example
as almost identical to the

01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.530
football ticket example.
 

01:05:46.530 --> 01:05:49.788
The final equilibrium is going
to maximize the sum of

01:05:49.788 --> 01:05:50.539
utilities.
 

01:05:50.539 --> 01:05:53.646
Here, this equilibrium is not
going to maximize the sum of

01:05:53.646 --> 01:05:54.300
utilities.
 

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.780
There's no reason it should
maximize the sum of utilities.

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.773
And so you need a different
definition of why the free

01:06:00.773 --> 01:06:02.469
market is such a good thing.
 

01:06:02.469 --> 01:06:04.489
So economists made a tremendous
mistake.

01:06:04.489 --> 01:06:07.864
They thought that the original
criterion for a good market is

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:09.889
you maximize the sum of
utilities.

01:06:09.889 --> 01:06:13.518
That's not even true in an
example like this one,

01:06:13.518 --> 01:06:16.436
so we need a different
definition which we call Pareto

01:06:16.436 --> 01:06:19.300
efficiency that illustrates why
the market's good.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.369
But if they made a mistake once
it stands to reason they could

01:06:22.369 --> 01:06:23.880
make a mistake another time.
 

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.239
So there's something special
even about this example.

01:06:26.239 --> 01:06:29.382
When we put in financial
variables I'm going to argue you

01:06:29.382 --> 01:06:32.525
shouldn't expect to get the
optimal outcome all the time,

01:06:32.525 --> 01:06:34.210
but that'll be next class.
 

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.139
Yes?
 

01:06:35.139 --> 01:06:38.661
Student: Beyond like
arithmetic use is there any

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:41.856
reason you would choose to
assume P_Y or

01:06:41.856 --> 01:06:44.530
P_X is 1 or it's
arbitrary?

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:44.929
Prof: No.
 

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:47.195
There's no reason to pick
P_X or P_Y

01:06:47.195 --> 01:06:49.418
to be 1, whichever one you want
you can choose to be 1,

01:06:49.418 --> 01:06:50.489
and I keep going back.
 

01:06:50.489 --> 01:06:53.043
I can never make up my mind
which one to do,

01:06:53.043 --> 01:06:55.300
so yeah, just whatever it works
out.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.168
This one it clearly worked out
arithmetically easy to take

01:06:58.168 --> 01:07:01.188
P_Y = 1 because the
marginal utility of Y was 1 and

01:07:01.188 --> 01:07:02.849
that canceled everything out.
 

01:07:02.849 --> 01:07:05.710
Here I could have taken either
one price to be 1 and it

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:06.929
wouldn't have helped.
 

01:07:06.929 --> 01:07:11.099
So I picked P_Y to be
1 again.

01:07:11.099 --> 01:07:16.525
In the last five minutes let's
just show how to solve this by

01:07:16.525 --> 01:07:17.518
computer.
 

01:07:17.518 --> 01:07:19.980
So this is something you also
are going to be able to do.

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.536
And it sounds like,
"Oh, there's so many

01:07:21.536 --> 01:07:22.280
complicated things.
 

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:24.240
There's these new
equations,"

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:26.500
if you do this for the problem
set,

01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:28.599
after you've done it once for
the problem set--

01:07:28.599 --> 01:07:30.130
you may have a little trouble
with the problem set,

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.217
the TAs will help you,
but after you do it once this

01:07:33.217 --> 01:07:34.550
will be very simple.
 

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:38.139
Now, doing it by computer is
also very simple.

01:07:38.139 --> 01:07:39.610
And it's going to sound
complicated,

01:07:39.610 --> 01:07:43.425
but as all you young people
know if any old guy can figure

01:07:43.425 --> 01:07:47.309
out how to work a computer you
can do it vastly quicker.

01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:55.519
So let's just take the second
example here.

01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:56.650
And we have five minutes left.
 

01:07:56.650 --> 01:07:58.590
That's all it'll take.
 

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:00.000
So this is Excel.
 

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.710
Now, Excel is this program
that's made zillions of dollars.

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:09.887
The inventor of Excel,
by the way, was the inventor of

01:08:09.887 --> 01:08:10.820
Lotus.
 

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.110
Oh, what was the guy's name?
 

01:08:13.110 --> 01:08:14.940
His sister was in my class at
Yale.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.198
He was two years ahead of me.
 

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:19.762
Not Gabor, Mitch Gabor,
[correction:

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:22.619
Mitch Kapor]
something like that was his

01:08:22.619 --> 01:08:23.279
name.
 

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.835
Anyway, she was in my class,
and he was two years ahead of

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:26.060
me.
 

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.724
And he invented this thing
called Lotus,

01:08:27.724 --> 01:08:28.920
which made a lot of money.
 

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.279
And then it got bought out by a
few people.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:35.778
And then Excel just basically
copied the entire thing,

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:39.408
Microsoft, and made a fortune
and had to pay him off for

01:08:39.408 --> 01:08:41.189
plagiarizing the thing.
 

01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:44.402
But anyway, it's basically
Mitch Gabor was the inventor,

01:08:44.402 --> 01:08:47.029
a Yale undergraduate two years
ahead of me.

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:49.310
So he's a billionaire now.
 

01:08:49.310 --> 01:08:51.979
So let's just solve the problem.
 

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:53.885
Let's do the second one because
I may not have time for the

01:08:53.885 --> 01:08:54.279
first one.
 

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:55.510
So what did I do?
 

01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:58.646
I said let's write down the
exogenous variables first,

01:08:58.646 --> 01:09:00.658
sorry let's just go up a
little.

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:04.530
So the exogenous variables are
the endowment of X,

01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:07.770
of the two goods,
A and B, that's 2 and 1,

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:09.430
and B is 1 and 2.
 

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:10.908
Now what are the variables?
 

01:09:10.908 --> 01:09:12.226
P_X,
P_Y,

01:09:12.226 --> 01:09:13.591
X^(A), Y^(A),
X^(B) and Y^(B),

01:09:13.591 --> 01:09:14.908
we don't what those are.
 

01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:17.689
So I've plugged in
P_X and P_Y.

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:20.429
I'll guess both of them are 1,
which is obviously going to be

01:09:20.429 --> 01:09:22.243
wrong,
and I'll guess that people just

01:09:22.243 --> 01:09:25.760
end up with their endowments,
which is obviously not right.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.590
So then I look at the budget
set.

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.738
So those are my guesses.
 

01:09:29.738 --> 01:09:32.500
These are the endogenous
variables and wild guesses about

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.239
the solution.
 

01:09:33.239 --> 01:09:34.720
Now, what are the equations?
 

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.930
Well, we wrote them down.
 

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:39.216
There's the budget set of A,
so that's just the budget set

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:39.618
of A.
 

01:09:39.618 --> 01:09:41.649
So how do you write these
equations down?

01:09:41.649 --> 01:09:46.136
You simply name the--it's up
here if you haven't used Excel

01:09:46.136 --> 01:09:47.529
before, up here.
 

01:09:47.529 --> 01:09:53.126
You write down the letter,
say B35 that's P_X,

01:09:53.126 --> 01:09:55.060
so B35 times B31.
 

01:09:55.060 --> 01:10:00.850
That's P_X,
is B35 times endowment X^(A).

01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:03.310
That's the income.
 

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:04.500
I wrote the income first.
 

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.404
That's the income A has minus
how much she spends or he

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:07.890
spends.
 

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:12.706
B35 times B37,
B35 remember is the price of X,

01:10:12.706 --> 01:10:15.489
B37 is how much he buys.
 

01:10:15.489 --> 01:10:16.670
So that's just the budget set.
 

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.957
So for each of these equations,
the marginal utility,

01:10:18.957 --> 01:10:20.189
I just did the same thing.
 

01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:23.729
Remember the 3 quarters,
over P_X times X = 1

01:10:23.729 --> 01:10:27.333
quarter over P_Y times
Y, so this [difference]

01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:29.170
should be equal to zero.
 

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:32.538
Instead of saying this equals
that I subtract the right hand

01:10:32.538 --> 01:10:34.310
side from the left hand side.
 

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:38.090
So you want all these equations
to be equal to zero.

01:10:38.090 --> 01:10:41.060
I just wrote down the six
equations.

01:10:41.060 --> 01:10:45.137
And so Excel now tells me that
of course the budget set is

01:10:45.137 --> 01:10:48.930
going to be satisfied
automatically because people are

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.149
consuming their endowments.
 

01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:53.768
And the budget set of B is
automatically satisfied because

01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.788
I just had them choosing their
endowments.

01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:58.099
And markets are going to clear,
of course, because everybody's

01:10:58.099 --> 01:11:00.220
choosing their endowments,
but they're not optimizing.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:03.770
So this marginal utility stuff
is all screwed up.

01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:05.118
So what do I do on the right?
 

01:11:05.118 --> 01:11:08.069
For every error in the equation
I square it.

01:11:08.069 --> 01:11:10.470
So I've squared all the errors.
 

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:12.721
So these are my equations I
need to satisfy,

01:11:12.721 --> 01:11:15.078
one, two, three,
four, five, six equations.

01:11:15.078 --> 01:11:17.530
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:19.600
and I summed the squares.
 

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.686
So if I make the sum of the
squares zeros each of those has

01:11:22.686 --> 01:11:23.380
to be zero.
 

01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.820
So Excel, now,
can minimize the sum of squared

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.310
errors.
 

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.979
Excel is going to search over
all endogenous variables,

01:11:29.979 --> 01:11:33.980
P_X through Y^(B) to
find the things that makes this

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:35.948
number as small as possible.
 

01:11:35.948 --> 01:11:38.582
Once this number becomes zero
it means all the ones above it

01:11:38.582 --> 01:11:41.393
have to be zero because they're
all squared numbers adding up to

01:11:41.393 --> 01:11:44.260
that,
and so I will find the solution.

01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:47.233
So you see that all you have to
do--if you've done this before

01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:49.671
of course it's obvious,
if you haven't it's just so

01:11:49.671 --> 01:11:51.279
simple to write the equation.
 

01:11:51.279 --> 01:11:54.590
Supply and demand I just name
the box,

01:11:54.590 --> 01:12:00.625
B32 that's the endowment of
Y^(A) the endowment of Y^(B)

01:12:00.625 --> 01:12:06.770
equals the consumption of A plus
the consumption of B.

01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:09.649
That's the difference we want
to make zero.

01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:11.510
So here's how you solve it.
 

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:14.368
There's a thing called solver.
 

01:12:14.368 --> 01:12:19.019
So you go to tools and you hit
solver, and now solver says you

01:12:19.019 --> 01:12:21.229
want to take a target cell.
 

01:12:21.229 --> 01:12:21.720
I cheated.
 

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:24.229
I already knew what it was, C47.
 

01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:25.510
So it's the target cell.
 

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:28.279
I hit minimize,
so I want to minimize that.

01:12:28.279 --> 01:12:30.658
And now what cells do I change?
 

01:12:30.658 --> 01:12:34.760
Well, I have to tell Excel what
to search over.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.970
So now Excel,
what are the cells?

01:12:37.970 --> 01:12:39.939
I could say P_X,
P_Y,

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:41.198
you know, all the endogenous
variables,

01:12:41.198 --> 01:12:44.413
but I know I can fix
P_X to be 1 so I'm

01:12:44.413 --> 01:12:48.500
going to forget that one and I'm
going to say just these five,

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:49.170
right?
 

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.112
I don't need all six of them,
just five because I can always

01:12:53.112 --> 01:12:55.050
take P_X to be 1.
 

01:12:55.050 --> 01:12:58.578
So the solver now knows it
wants to minimize this number,

01:12:58.578 --> 01:13:02.631
which is the squared errors of
all the equations I want to hold

01:13:02.631 --> 01:13:04.752
equal,
it's going to minimize that by

01:13:04.752 --> 01:13:06.488
searching over all those
numbers.

01:13:06.488 --> 01:13:08.372
It's not very smart about
searching for it,

01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:10.210
and sometimes it never finds an
answer.

01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:14.217
We know there always is an
answer, and so how do you solve

01:13:14.217 --> 01:13:14.569
it?
 

01:13:14.569 --> 01:13:17.649
You just hit solve and it's
going to search and do it.

01:13:17.649 --> 01:13:19.578
And what should the answer be?
 

01:13:19.578 --> 01:13:23.649
If I fix P_X to be 1,
remember the answer was when

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:27.029
P_Y is 1,
X turns out to be 5 halves.

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:32.037
If I fix P_X to be
one, what should P_Y

01:13:32.037 --> 01:13:32.470
be?
 

01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:36.257
The solution we got before was
P_X = 5 halves and

01:13:36.257 --> 01:13:37.630
P_Y is 1.
 

01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:40.898
Now I'm going to fix
P_X to be 1,

01:13:40.898 --> 01:13:42.609
so what should Y be?
 

01:13:42.609 --> 01:13:45.463
X was 5 halves times Y,
so Y should be .4,

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:49.362
so if this solves right we
should get P_Y to be

01:13:49.362 --> 01:13:49.850
.4.
 

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:55.250
So I just hit solve and voila I
get P_Y to be .4.

01:13:55.250 --> 01:13:57.409
I find X^(A) is 1.8.
 

01:13:57.409 --> 01:13:58.510
I find all the numbers.
 

01:13:58.510 --> 01:14:00.890
I just solved it just like that
instantly.

01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:04.939
So you can see how useful it's
going to be to use solver and do

01:14:04.939 --> 01:14:06.050
these problems.
 

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:08.634
Student: If you change
the endowments does that change

01:14:08.634 --> 01:14:08.850
it?
 

01:14:08.850 --> 01:14:09.310
Prof: Of course.
 

01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:12.306
If I change the endowments I'll
get a different answer,

01:14:12.306 --> 01:14:14.916
and if I increase the
endowments yes it does and

01:14:14.916 --> 01:14:16.359
that's very important.
 

01:14:16.359 --> 01:14:18.324
Student:
&gt;

01:14:18.324 --> 01:14:20.340
increasing it
&gt;

01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.109
Prof: If I double
everybody's endowment?

01:14:22.109 --> 01:14:24.158
Student: If you double
one endowment.

01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:26.386
Prof: If I double one
endowment that's going to change

01:14:26.386 --> 01:14:26.979
things around.
 

01:14:26.979 --> 01:14:29.873
If I double everybody's
endowment it won't change

01:14:29.873 --> 01:14:30.899
anything, yeah.
 

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:36.000

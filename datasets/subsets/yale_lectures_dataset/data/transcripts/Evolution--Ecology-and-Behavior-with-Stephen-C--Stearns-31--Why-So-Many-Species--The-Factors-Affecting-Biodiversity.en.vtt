00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.696
Prof: Now today I am
going to talk about biodiversity

00:00:06.696 --> 00:00:10.682
and whether or not it's
something we should be worried

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:13.534
about,
and how to think about things

00:00:13.534 --> 00:00:17.442
like the extinction crisis which
is being caused by human

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:18.280
activity.
 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.430
And I don't want you to forget
this extremely simple idea here,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.063
that the impact of humans on
the environment basically is a

00:00:26.063 --> 00:00:28.560
function of how many people
there are on the planet,

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.479
times the average amount that
each of those people consumes,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.732
multiplied perhaps by some
fudge factor to express good or

00:00:37.732 --> 00:00:41.510
bad behavior on the part of the
humans.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.927
And I think that the Greeks
probably could have written that

00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:50.320
down 2500 years ago.
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.500
It's pretty straightforward.
 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.020
It's nothing that is
particularly surprising.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.427
Nevertheless it is striking to
me that this half of the

00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:04.927
equation,
the upper half of the equation,

00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:06.349
which is the population
problem,

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:12.069
has pretty much disappeared
from public discourse on this

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.966
issue,
and I think it's a result of

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:19.063
pushback from various groups
that see any discussion of the

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:23.159
population problem as inevitably
involving contraception or

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.108
abortion,
which for some groups has

00:01:26.108 --> 00:01:27.470
religious issues.
 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.140
And it's also a pushback from
the poor countries of the world,

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560
against the rich countries,
saying,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.123
"You can't come down here
and tell us what to do after

00:01:36.123 --> 00:01:38.510
you've all gone and screwed up
your own environment.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.849
Let us get on with our own
lives, and that's not our

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:41.629
priority."
 

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:44.555
Nevertheless,
in the long-term,

00:01:44.555 --> 00:01:45.920
that's true.
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.711
The impact of humans on the
environment of the planet is

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:53.985
basically a function of how many
people there are on the planet

00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:56.260
times how much they're using.
 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.769
And we can't get away from that.
 

00:01:58.769 --> 00:02:04.570
You will find in the literature
on things about biodiversity

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.568
problems, extinction problems,
an awful lot of fairly refined,

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:12.930
scientific analysis.
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.896
You will find people applying
cutting edge ecological theory

00:02:17.896 --> 00:02:19.158
to the issue.
 

00:02:19.158 --> 00:02:24.675
But, by way of introduction,
I never want you to forget that

00:02:24.675 --> 00:02:30.379
the problem of human impact on
the other species on the planet

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.616
is not a problem that we can
really solve with scientific

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:37.020
research.
 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.345
We can only solve it by
understanding the incentives

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:43.280
that people encounter to have
more babies,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.644
or fewer babies,
and the incentives that they

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.169
encounter to consume more or to
consume less.

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.800
This is a really tough nut.
 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.674
If any of you think this is
simple, just think of what's

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:55.870
going on in the global financial
crisis.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.180
The people of the world are
trying to stimulate consumption.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.270
They're desperate not to be
poor.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.776
And that flies right in the
face of the environmental

00:03:08.776 --> 00:03:09.990
catastrophe.
 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.680
I don't think there's any easy
answer on that.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.490
Yes Blake?
 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.429
Student: People are
interested in

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:17.538
&gt;.
 

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:19.798
Prof: Right,
Bob Wyman teaches a class on

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:20.758
population growth.
 

00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:23.316
By the way, let me just take
one of Bob's slides,

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:25.180
which he shared with me
recently.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.822
If you go around the planet and
you ask people how many babies

00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:34.050
do they want,
good sociological research

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.229
indicates that they want about
two-thirds of what they actually

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:42.038
get.
 

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.621
And that suggests that the
easiest way to solve the

00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:47.410
population problem is not to do
anything Draconian,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.026
but just to give every woman on
the planet control of her own

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:58.430
reproductive fate;
by whatever means.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.463
Okay, I just wanted to make
sure I got that message across

00:04:01.463 --> 00:04:02.050
up front.
 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.863
Now today I'm going to discuss
extinctions, and I am going to

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:12.706
do it from ecological,
economical, evolutionary and

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:15.419
personal points of view.
 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:20.120
And within the ecological
literature this is an old

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.194
chestnut,
and basically back oh say about

00:04:24.194 --> 00:04:29.800
thirty to fifty years ago there
was intuition that suggested

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.120
that the more diverse an
ecosystem was the more stable it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.449
would be.
 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.295
And people like stability,
they don't like to be hit by

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.983
surprises, and so diversity
would be good because it

00:04:41.983 --> 00:04:43.250
conferred stability.
 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.466
Then Bob May showed that more
diverse communities can be less

00:04:48.466 --> 00:04:49.250
stable.
 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.014
That's not a necessary logical
connection, that more diverse

00:04:53.014 --> 00:04:55.709
things are more stable;
sometimes more diverse

00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:57.160
communities are less stable.
 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.319
Since then there have been a
lot of experiments.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.199
There isn't a convincing clear
pattern.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.684
More recent theory shows that
sometimes diversity can increase

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:05.370
stability.
 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.399
This one seems to be a moving
target,

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:11.850
and I think it's one where we
have to be modest and say that,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.661
"You know,
in any particular circumstance

00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:17.600
we don't really know what would
happen."

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.028
Stability itself is a fairly
abstract term,

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:24.189
and it can either refer to
resistance,

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.829
which means ability to remain
in the same state,

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:29.584
or to resilience,
which means ability to return

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:32.279
to the same state following a
perturbation;

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:36.300
so bending without breaking.
 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.110
And that is probably more
important in the real world.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.829
Okay?
 

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:44.596
Now, what do we actually know
experimentally about what

00:05:44.596 --> 00:05:48.040
species diversity does to
ecosystems?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.851
Well there's some evidence,
by the way, that most of this

00:05:52.851 --> 00:05:57.319
data has to do with plants,
or plants and insects.

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.855
A richer community appears
better able to survive a

00:06:05.855 --> 00:06:06.819
drought.
 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.949
That is probably because the
plants in interaction with each

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.389
other are actually conserving
water locally.

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.319
If you look at net primary
productivity,

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.720
as you increase the number of
plant species,

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.052
the productivity,
in terms of kilograms of carbon

00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:28.360
fixed per square meter per year
goes up and then levels off;

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.589
so there's diminishing returns.
 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.819
But the more different kinds of
things,

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.367
at least at the beginning,
that you pack into a given

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:36.644
space,
because they're partitioning

00:06:36.644 --> 00:06:40.771
the environment differently the
more they're going to be able to

00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:44.898
take out of the sunlight and the
C02 and the water that's in the

00:06:44.898 --> 00:06:46.779
system,
and convert it into

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.459
biologically useful materials.
 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:54.711
There's some evidence that as
you increase the number of

00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:57.956
species in the community,
the harder it is for an

00:06:57.956 --> 00:07:01.490
invasive species to get into
that community.

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.432
So these kinds of things are
done usually in fairly simple

00:07:07.432 --> 00:07:09.829
experimental gardens.
 

00:07:09.829 --> 00:07:19.276
And I think that the
application of that to the real

00:07:19.276 --> 00:07:26.129
world I have to remain agnostic
on;

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.990
it might work, it might not.
 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.000
Recently there was a very nice
paper--

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.660
this in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society this year--

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.939
showing that more diverse
pollinator communities provide

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:43.370
more reliable service.
 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.269
So this X axis here is
proportion of native vegetation,

00:07:48.269 --> 00:07:52.240
and this is the number of
pollinator individuals,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.654
and this is again proportion of
native vegetation and number of

00:07:55.654 --> 00:07:56.149
visits.
 

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:02.682
And basically what it's showing
is that the more diverse the

00:08:02.682 --> 00:08:07.045
pollinator community,
the more likely it is that the

00:08:07.045 --> 00:08:09.490
plants in it are going to get
pollinated,

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.920
because the different kinds of
pollinators are complementary,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.970
they're trading services as
they come in.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.240
And this connects a bit to
ecosystem function,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.298
because after all one of the
things that Mother Nature gives

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:27.149
us in agriculture is the
services of the pollinators.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.726
And if we didn't have them,
the almond industry and the

00:08:31.726 --> 00:08:35.538
apple industry of the world
would collapse.

00:08:35.538 --> 00:08:39.850
So if we do things that wipe
out the pollinator community,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.732
or radically simplify it,
this paper suggests we can

00:08:42.732 --> 00:08:46.238
expect that we're going to have
a decrease in our fruit and our

00:08:46.238 --> 00:08:47.029
nut crops.
 

00:08:50.399 --> 00:08:55.207
So a few ecological points
about diversity is that it does

00:08:55.207 --> 00:08:58.918
seem to improve some ecosystem
properties.

00:08:58.918 --> 00:09:02.011
There's some evidence that
connects species diversity to

00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:04.428
resilience and to resistance to
invasion.

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:10.018
Not too many people who have
been working in the ecosystem

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:15.803
function end of science have
been terribly worried about the

00:09:15.803 --> 00:09:19.528
diversity of individuals in
genes;

00:09:19.528 --> 00:09:22.570
they've been looking mostly at
species diversity.

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.482
But it may very well be that if
you have say a group of

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:31.048
pollinators and you look within
a single species and you compare

00:09:31.048 --> 00:09:35.106
very genetically diverse species
of pollinators with very

00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:39.528
genetically homogenous species
of pollinators that the genetic

00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:43.370
diversity may also have a
significant impact.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.559
So there are a whole series of
levels at which one can ask the

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:50.995
diversity question,
and not all of them are equally

00:09:50.995 --> 00:09:52.370
well researched.
 

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:56.820
Now let me just go back to the
ecological view of diversity

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.889
here and make a general comment
on it.

00:09:59.889 --> 00:10:05.245
One of the arguments that
conservation advocates use is

00:10:05.245 --> 00:10:10.798
that biodiversity is important
for ecosystem function.

00:10:10.798 --> 00:10:14.620
And I'm now about to go into an
argument on ecosystem function.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:15.418
Okay?
 

00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:18.077
And it's about how much it's
going to cost us to replace

00:10:18.077 --> 00:10:18.899
those services.
 

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:22.600
And I'm just setting a pointer
here,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.211
because I'll come back in a few
minutes and point out that if

00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:31.977
you claim that you need a lot of
biodiversity to maintain clean

00:10:31.977 --> 00:10:33.457
air,
clean water,

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:36.875
pollination services,
everything that Nature gives us

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:39.405
for free,
but if Nature is really

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:43.634
redundant, so that you could
actually get rid of 90% of the

00:10:43.634 --> 00:10:47.937
species on the earth before you
even noticed any decrease in

00:10:47.937 --> 00:10:51.068
ecosystem function,
that you are then involving

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:53.928
yourself in a political argument
which is quite dangerous;

00:10:53.928 --> 00:10:57.285
and that is that you appear not
to know what you're talking

00:10:57.285 --> 00:10:57.750
about.
 

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.200
Because your critics could come
back year after year saying,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.880
"Oh, we've lost another
10% of the species on the planet

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.250
and the ecosystems are still
functioning just fine.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.950
You're just crying wolf."
 

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:09.293
Until, of course,
you get down to the point where

00:11:09.293 --> 00:11:12.322
you've trimmed away so many that
the next ones really do make a

00:11:12.322 --> 00:11:14.178
difference to ecosystem
function,

00:11:14.178 --> 00:11:16.639
and then we're all in deep
water.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:22.426
So there is a real problem here
of being able to communicate to

00:11:22.426 --> 00:11:25.826
the general public,
and the politicians,

00:11:25.826 --> 00:11:30.000
the issue that you could have a
lot of ecosystem redundancy,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.418
which is buffering you from the
extinctions that might otherwise

00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:36.210
be affecting ecosystem function,
but at some point,

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.190
if you've eliminated a lot of
species,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.298
you will hit a limit at which
there's no redundancy left,

00:11:41.298 --> 00:11:44.889
and at that point ecosystems
start to collapse.

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:48.988
So let's now go through the
economic argument,

00:11:48.988 --> 00:11:54.269
and you'll see how much it
might cost to replace things.

00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:58.330
So there have been attempts,
mainly by Bob Costanza and his

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.134
group--
he's now at the University of

00:12:00.134 --> 00:12:04.225
Vermont--
to estimate what is the value

00:12:04.225 --> 00:12:07.149
of ecosystem function.
 

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:09.562
And before we get into
Costanza's, we can look at

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:10.970
something like Habitat II.
 

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:16.830
So Ed Bass decides twenty years
ago or so to build a very

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:23.110
futuristic architectural piece
out in the Arizona desert,

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.191
which is an attempt to see
whether or not you could

00:12:26.191 --> 00:12:30.259
actually build an interstellar
spacecraft with a self-enclosed,

00:12:30.259 --> 00:12:33.417
completely recycling ecosystem,
such that people could go in it

00:12:33.417 --> 00:12:36.474
and there would be everything in
it that people would need to

00:12:36.474 --> 00:12:37.340
live forever.
 

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.543
So if you just make one of
those things and put it out into

00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:43.750
space, potentially humans could
colonize other galaxies.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.428
It's a very bold idea, right?
 

00:12:46.428 --> 00:12:50.620
So it costs 9 million per
person, and if we wanted to

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.653
replace the earth with that,
you could figure that it's

00:12:54.653 --> 00:12:58.250
about 54 thousand-trillion to
replace- to support everybody on

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:01.120
earth,
to get them to another galaxy.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.129
Unfortunately Habitat II didn't
work.

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:05.710
&gt;
 

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:09.586
So it wasn't complete,
and the people who went in it

00:13:09.586 --> 00:13:14.528
and tried to live in it had to
bail out after about six months.

00:13:14.528 --> 00:13:17.769
So this line of reasoning,
which by the way is always

00:13:17.769 --> 00:13:21.506
going to end up with very big
numbers, is basically a comment

00:13:21.506 --> 00:13:24.316
on externalization;
and externalization is

00:13:24.316 --> 00:13:27.446
economics talk for things which
are not my problem,

00:13:27.446 --> 00:13:28.259
thank you.
 

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:33.178
So they are basically what we
define,

00:13:33.178 --> 00:13:37.427
in our approach to the problem,
as being outside the scope of

00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:41.533
the problem and outside the
scope of our ability to come up

00:13:41.533 --> 00:13:42.950
with a solution.
 

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:47.335
And I think you'll see that
some of these things need to be

00:13:47.335 --> 00:13:48.470
internalized.
 

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:53.927
So the issue of externalization
is that in economics it means

00:13:53.927 --> 00:13:57.019
it's not captured by the market.
 

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:59.772
So it's not something whose
consequences,

00:13:59.772 --> 00:14:02.250
whose costs,
are reckoned into market

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.418
calculations.
 

00:14:03.418 --> 00:14:07.354
So what Costanza and his crew
did was they tried to calculate

00:14:07.354 --> 00:14:10.240
the marginal value of ecosystem
services,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.770
and they just took the present
value of the service and then

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.538
asked,
"If we just tweak it a

00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:17.770
little bit,
how much is it going to cost us

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:20.889
to replace--
just looking at the current

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:23.820
situation,
if we try to calculate the

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:27.734
replacement cost by tweaking
that service so that Mother

00:14:27.734 --> 00:14:31.730
Nature doesn't provide it,
we have to replace it,

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.029
how much is it going to cost
us?"

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:40.548
Well they have a lot of numbers
in their paper,

00:14:40.548 --> 00:14:45.470
and I'll just run through some
of them.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:50.583
This is not--I don't really
expect you to memorize which

00:14:50.583 --> 00:14:54.490
ecosystem service costs more to
replace.

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:59.330
But I think it is notable that
fertilizer in nutrient cycling,

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.980
keeping all of the plants on
the planet well fed,

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.897
is something that Mother Nature
does for us that would cost 17

00:15:06.897 --> 00:15:08.309
trillion to replace.
 

00:15:08.309 --> 00:15:10.706
It's interesting;
I heard Ed Wilson in Washington

00:15:10.706 --> 00:15:13.360
a couple of weeks ago,
and he was talking about

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.168
figures like this,
and he said, "You know,

00:15:15.168 --> 00:15:18.038
before this recovery plan,
the stimulus package,

00:15:18.038 --> 00:15:20.570
I used to think that trillion
was a big number."

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:21.750
&gt;
 

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.320
"And now it's a trillion
here, a trillion there;

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.418
after awhile you're talking
real money."

00:15:27.418 --> 00:15:32.436
You can see the kinds of things
that people identify as

00:15:32.436 --> 00:15:35.918
ecosystem services,
and certainly among them

00:15:35.918 --> 00:15:38.982
nutrient cycling,
waste management,

00:15:38.982 --> 00:15:41.360
water supply,
food,

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.945
the regulation of the
atmosphere, the regulation of

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:52.138
water on the landscape,
flooding and things like that,

00:15:52.138 --> 00:15:54.960
those are all quite serious
things,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.048
and Mother Nature is doing a
lot of that for us,

00:15:58.048 --> 00:16:01.750
and she's never- she hasn't
been billing us for it lately.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.370
And if you look at where this
is going on,

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:12.652
you'll find that the oceans are
actually doing about twice as

00:16:12.652 --> 00:16:17.125
much as the land,
and the estuaries are providing

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:20.028
a tremendous amount of ecosystem
services,

00:16:20.028 --> 00:16:23.299
and boy do people like to build
their houses on the water.

00:16:23.299 --> 00:16:24.210
&gt;
 

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.604
So if you just look at what
happened to the coast of the

00:16:27.604 --> 00:16:31.245
Mediterranean or the coast of
Southeast Asia or the coast of

00:16:31.245 --> 00:16:34.269
the Eastern Seaboard or Southern
California,

00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:39.538
that is where people
concentrate their living.

00:16:39.538 --> 00:16:41.769
They concentrate their living
right around estuaries;

00:16:41.769 --> 00:16:44.000
Chesapeake Bay, for example.
 

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.889
And if you look at what are the
important parts of the

00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:51.705
continental land masses,
the wetlands and the forests

00:16:51.705 --> 00:16:56.394
are extremely important parts;
although you can't really say

00:16:56.394 --> 00:17:00.104
that the grasslands are
unimportant, they're still

00:17:00.104 --> 00:17:04.568
providing about a trillion a
year in ecosystem services.

00:17:04.568 --> 00:17:07.715
So the marginal value,
back in 1997,

00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:13.020
the marginal value of total
planetary ecosystem services was

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.000
about 33 trillion.
 

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.640
That was about four times the
U.S. GDP at that time.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.063
Of course the U.S. GDP is
greater now, but I'll bet you

00:17:22.063 --> 00:17:25.804
that the replacement costs for
what Nature gives us for free

00:17:25.804 --> 00:17:27.390
are bigger now too.
 

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:29.990
So it's a big number.
 

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:34.040
And that's an estimate of how
much the global economy is

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:38.385
essentially externalizing the
costs of environmental impact,

00:17:38.385 --> 00:17:40.670
and environmental services.
 

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:44.346
It's an estimate of the global
magnitude of the tragedy of the

00:17:44.346 --> 00:17:46.622
commons,
which is that we all

00:17:46.622 --> 00:17:50.250
individually want to take and
use services,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:56.933
but our individual behavior is
eroding the environment for the

00:17:56.933 --> 00:17:58.250
community.
 

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:04.684
And that is an estimate of to
what degree we're not connected

00:18:04.684 --> 00:18:09.190
to the consequences of our own
actions,

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:12.568
and to what degree we're not
cleaning up our own messes.

00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:21.400
So this economic view has been
criticized;

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.855
it's been criticized for bad
economics and it's been

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:26.818
criticized for bad ecology.
 

00:18:26.818 --> 00:18:31.198
I actually think that it
retains an important take-home

00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:32.964
message,
which is robust,

00:18:32.964 --> 00:18:36.193
which is after you apply all
the criticisms and make all the

00:18:36.193 --> 00:18:38.550
adjustments,
Mother Nature is still

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:42.390
providing us with goods and
services of enormous value,

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.608
which would be impossible for
us to replace if we had to.

00:18:46.608 --> 00:18:49.779
I don't think there's any
getting around that.

00:18:49.779 --> 00:18:52.865
One can argue about the
numbers, but I think the

00:18:52.865 --> 00:18:55.099
take-home message remains solid.
 

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.640
Now to come back to my earlier
point about redundancy.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.288
We could probably get by with a
lot fewer species.

00:19:04.288 --> 00:19:07.336
And this was brought home to me
by my friend Pierre Henri

00:19:07.336 --> 00:19:10.244
Gouyon,
who grew up in Central Paris,

00:19:10.244 --> 00:19:13.588
in the cinquième
arrondissement,

00:19:13.588 --> 00:19:17.140
in the middle of a fairly
artificial environment.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.515
And basically he said,
"Listen,

00:19:19.515 --> 00:19:22.910
we don't need ten million
species on the planet.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:25.910
We only need 117.
 

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.868
We need cows, sheep and goats.
 

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:31.828
We need bacteria and fungi for
cheese, wine and beer.

00:19:31.828 --> 00:19:35.102
And, in other words,
we only need the things that

00:19:35.102 --> 00:19:37.420
will directly keep humans alive.
 

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:43.045
And if we need some to provide
these ecosystem services that

00:19:43.045 --> 00:19:47.614
we've just gone through,
fine, maybe we need a few more,

00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:49.930
but we don't need 10
million."

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:56.779
Now Pierre Henri actually is a
convinced environmentalist,

00:19:56.779 --> 00:20:01.230
and he actually got fired from
his job for arguing with the

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:04.990
French government about
environmental problems.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:09.093
He had a radio show in Paris,
and so he has been relegated to

00:20:09.093 --> 00:20:13.196
the Natural History Museum in
Paris, which is a repository of

00:20:13.196 --> 00:20:14.358
biodiversity.
 

00:20:14.358 --> 00:20:19.403
But this is--he made this
argument in order to drive home

00:20:19.403 --> 00:20:24.626
the point that there's a lot of
loose thinking that goes on

00:20:24.626 --> 00:20:28.680
about ecosystem function and
redundancy,

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.747
and maybe it's good to have a
starting point from which you

00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:34.150
can argue upwards.
 

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:39.636
Because once you decide that
you're going to base your

00:20:39.636 --> 00:20:45.538
arguments for preserving species
on practical grounds,

00:20:45.538 --> 00:20:48.057
and you're going to use
economic terms to argue for

00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:51.705
them,
then you have to back it up

00:20:51.705 --> 00:20:56.434
with data,
and you have to back it up with

00:20:56.434 --> 00:20:58.980
well established facts.
 

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.675
And by starting with just 117,
I think that you are forced to

00:21:03.675 --> 00:21:08.294
confront a number of pretty
serious issues in trying to make

00:21:08.294 --> 00:21:09.859
those arguments.
 

00:21:09.859 --> 00:21:11.940
So that's the economic view.
 

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.058
What would an evolutionary
biologist say?

00:21:15.058 --> 00:21:20.589
Well basically it's pretty
clear that every tip on the Tree

00:21:20.589 --> 00:21:25.930
of Life has been on the planet
for 3.5 billion years,

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.400
and they've all managed to make
it this far.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.118
Good job.
 

00:21:30.118 --> 00:21:32.442
It doesn't mean one's better
than the other,

00:21:32.442 --> 00:21:33.630
they've all made it.
 

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.240
And if we just think about
relationship,

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.126
we have shared ancestors with-
we do share ancestors with all

00:21:41.126 --> 00:21:44.321
life on the planet,
with the possible exception of

00:21:44.321 --> 00:21:46.845
those nasty viruses that have
been so much with us this

00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:49.102
winter,
and which are causing coughing

00:21:49.102 --> 00:21:50.088
in the audience.
 

00:21:50.088 --> 00:21:54.628
And you can go back and you can
find relationships with

00:21:54.628 --> 00:21:57.740
virtually everything on the
planet;

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.828
just deeper and deeper in time.
 

00:21:59.828 --> 00:22:02.760
And if you think about it,
and you go back on the Tree of

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.346
Life,
there you are,

00:22:04.346 --> 00:22:08.454
maybe 3 billion years ago,
and the archaea are going off

00:22:08.454 --> 00:22:11.884
in this direction and the
eukaryota are going off in that

00:22:11.884 --> 00:22:15.032
direction;
or you go back 15 million years

00:22:15.032 --> 00:22:18.373
and the Old World monkeys are
going this way,

00:22:18.373 --> 00:22:21.410
and the hominidae are going
that way.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.342
Or you go back 7 million years
and the chimpanzees go that way

00:22:26.342 --> 00:22:29.900
and homo goes off in this other
direction.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.750
Basically if you're looking it
as an evolutionary biologist,

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.568
okay, some chunk of DNA went
one way and some chunk of DNA

00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:38.611
went the other,
down this branch,

00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:41.930
and they both managed to make
it to this point,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.425
but you can't really derive any
kind of morality about who has

00:22:45.425 --> 00:22:48.807
the right to dominate and who
has the right to take over the

00:22:48.807 --> 00:22:50.930
resources of the world from
that.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.430
It's just a neutral pattern,
it's out there.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.130
Okay?
 

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:59.162
So from that point of view,
looking at human culture is

00:22:59.162 --> 00:23:02.442
kind of interesting,
because it's pretty late in the

00:23:02.442 --> 00:23:05.163
game of evolution that humans
come up with this idea of

00:23:05.163 --> 00:23:05.869
dominating.
 

00:23:05.869 --> 00:23:09.130
And we are the winners.
 

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:10.420
Okay?
 

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.406
Actually this is quote from my
younger son: Winners write

00:23:13.406 --> 00:23:15.180
history, losers write
novels.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:18.534
The losers, who are the other
species on the planet,

00:23:18.534 --> 00:23:21.559
pretty much have to accommodate
to the winners,

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:24.848
who are us, and who are
dominating the planet.

00:23:24.848 --> 00:23:28.372
And if you think about what
we've done to them:

00:23:28.372 --> 00:23:32.891
if you think about say 25% of
the birds going extinct in the

00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.198
Pacific;
if you think about the fact

00:23:35.198 --> 00:23:37.410
that current levels of
extinction during the

00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.651
anthropogenic extinction crisis
are running at about 100 to 1000

00:23:40.651 --> 00:23:43.451
times background rate;
if you think about the fact

00:23:43.451 --> 00:23:46.534
that the total impact of human
civilization on the planet is

00:23:46.534 --> 00:23:49.617
getting up to the point where
it's approaching that of a big

00:23:49.617 --> 00:23:53.830
meteorite hitting the Yucatan,
then I think that it's probably

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.269
justified to use a phrase like
the greatest crimes.

00:23:58.269 --> 00:24:01.720
Okay, this isn't Zhuang Zi,
whom I really like.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.497
But basically what we've done
is we've driven to extinction,

00:24:05.497 --> 00:24:09.338
and are driving to extinction,
many of the other occupants of

00:24:09.338 --> 00:24:10.298
the planet.
 

00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:14.420
And because it is increasing
our quality of life,

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:17.098
and our gross domestic
products, and our gross

00:24:17.098 --> 00:24:21.490
planetary product,
it gets spun as being necessary

00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:25.950
for standard of living and
economic growth.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:28.940
So that would be an
evolutionary point of view.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.473
Or let's say an evolutionary
biologist who loved plants and

00:24:33.473 --> 00:24:38.478
animals would probably take that
rather cynical look at the whole

00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:42.700
impact of human culture and
history on the planet.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.721
Now to be fair to us--you know,
that's a fairly hard look at

00:24:46.721 --> 00:24:48.392
us--
but to be fair to us,

00:24:48.392 --> 00:24:51.640
I think if any other species
evolved to be dominant,

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.788
it probably would behave pretty
much the same way,

00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:57.574
because it would have gotten
into that position by having a

00:24:57.574 --> 00:25:01.684
motivational structure that made
it competitive and caused it to

00:25:01.684 --> 00:25:05.338
be very efficient at extracting
and using resources.

00:25:05.338 --> 00:25:11.152
And if we can ever actually
behave nicely to other species,

00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:17.165
then I think that that would be
a profound victory of culture

00:25:17.165 --> 00:25:18.868
over biology.
 

00:25:18.868 --> 00:25:21.298
If you want to use a kin
selection argument,

00:25:21.298 --> 00:25:24.298
don't hold your breath on this
one,

00:25:24.298 --> 00:25:26.634
because we haven't yet
demonstrated that we can behave

00:25:26.634 --> 00:25:29.601
nicely to other human beings;
and they're much more closely

00:25:29.601 --> 00:25:31.480
related to us than other
species.

00:25:34.598 --> 00:25:42.894
So I hope by this point you're
realizing that the extinction

00:25:42.894 --> 00:25:45.652
crisis,
and the meaning of biodiversity

00:25:45.652 --> 00:25:49.876
on the planet,
is an interesting probe into

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:54.788
our own nature and our own
priorities.

00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:58.390
And in struggling with it there
will be many points at which one

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.618
could become pessimistic or
cynical,

00:26:00.618 --> 00:26:04.499
but in fact I think you can
look at it as an opportunity to

00:26:04.499 --> 00:26:08.111
learn an awful lot about
ourselves and about the Nature

00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:09.849
that we interact with.
 

00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:11.558
So it's not all pessimistic.
 

00:26:11.558 --> 00:26:15.449
It's simply a very
deep-cutting,

00:26:15.449 --> 00:26:18.210
revealing situation.
 

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:23.642
Now the personal point of view,
it was captured in this book

00:26:23.642 --> 00:26:27.534
that my wife and I wrote,
and I'd like to tell you a

00:26:27.534 --> 00:26:30.566
little bit about why we wrote it
and the sort of lessons that

00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:31.828
we've learned from it.
 

00:26:31.828 --> 00:26:36.529
So that's the name of the book,
and this picture is in it.

00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:39.737
These are two Swiss hunters in
Southern Switzerland,

00:26:39.737 --> 00:26:43.700
and this is the last bear that
was ever found in Switzerland.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:47.180
They shot it in 1905.
 

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:50.534
And this kind of thing,
by the way, is now going on

00:26:50.534 --> 00:26:52.480
again in Idaho and Montana.
 

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.598
The Department of the Interior
has just lifted the ban on

00:26:56.598 --> 00:26:57.848
killing wolves.
 

00:26:57.848 --> 00:27:01.195
There are about 800 wolves in
Idaho and Montana,

00:27:01.195 --> 00:27:03.759
and they're getting shot at
again.

00:27:03.759 --> 00:27:08.118
So this sort of thing is the
way people behave.

00:27:08.118 --> 00:27:10.564
These guys were very proud of
the fact that they'd gotten a

00:27:10.564 --> 00:27:10.859
bear.
 

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.318
So why did we write the book?
 

00:27:16.318 --> 00:27:21.010
Well when I was--back in 1987,
I was asked by the Swiss

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:26.048
Government to comment on a
whitepaper that had been written

00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:31.268
by an office in Washington,
which had been set up by

00:27:31.268 --> 00:27:35.838
Congress to survey developments
in science,

00:27:35.838 --> 00:27:40.945
and make recommendations to
Congress on whether or not

00:27:40.945 --> 00:27:44.798
things were serious and needed
action.

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:49.114
And Peter Raven and Ed Wilson
had managed to move the

00:27:49.114 --> 00:27:53.180
biodiversity crisis up to a
fairly high level,

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.275
and this office had taken
attention of it and had written

00:27:56.275 --> 00:27:59.050
a whitepaper,
and the Swiss Government asked

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:01.890
me and my group to evaluate this
whitepaper.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.308
As a result of that,
at the time that the European

00:28:05.308 --> 00:28:08.240
Union decided to do something
about it,

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.358
I was invited as Switzerland's
representative,

00:28:10.358 --> 00:28:15.140
to come to this meeting,
which John Lawton had arranged.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.376
And it was held in England,
and at the meeting I was asked

00:28:18.376 --> 00:28:21.898
to write a cover letter to our
report, which was going to go to

00:28:21.898 --> 00:28:23.490
the European Commission.
 

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:24.308
Okay?
 

00:28:24.308 --> 00:28:27.016
And I'm going to read a few
sections out of that,

00:28:27.016 --> 00:28:30.230
because this is actually what
got me to write the book.

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:34.088
So, "The causes of
biodiversity crisis aren't in

00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:37.724
Nature, they're in human
economic and reproductive

00:28:37.724 --> 00:28:39.210
behaviors."
 

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.140
So it's right there.
 

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:43.590
"And biological research
isn't going to change human

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:44.269
behavior.
 

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:48.212
Human behavior can only be
changed by education,

00:28:48.212 --> 00:28:52.743
economic, demographic policy,
and by shared values that

00:28:52.743 --> 00:28:55.009
determine policy."
 

00:28:55.009 --> 00:28:55.910
Okay?
 

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.670
At least shared values in a
democracy;

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:00.410
we were in European democracies.
 

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.125
"The long-term solution
requires a reduction in

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:08.420
birthrates and radical changes
in consumption.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.104
However, starving,
insecure and repressed people

00:29:11.104 --> 00:29:13.673
kill each other,
they destroy the environment,

00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:16.130
they drive species to
extinction."

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:18.630
We certainly saw that in the
wars in the Congo where the

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:21.357
poachers were going through the
gorilla reserves and chopping

00:29:21.357 --> 00:29:22.538
them up for bush meat.
 

00:29:22.538 --> 00:29:26.093
"So the political
challenge is to figure out a way

00:29:26.093 --> 00:29:29.118
to make people comfortable,
secure and free.

00:29:29.118 --> 00:29:33.236
And that is a necessary
precondition for long-term

00:29:33.236 --> 00:29:35.839
biodiversity stability."
 

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:37.259
We can't wait to do that.
 

00:29:37.259 --> 00:29:38.338
Okay?
 

00:29:38.338 --> 00:29:41.921
We can't wait for political and
economic change before we begin

00:29:41.921 --> 00:29:44.288
to protect ecosystems and save
species.

00:29:44.288 --> 00:29:46.795
Because if we do,
there's not going to be much

00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:47.630
left to save.
 

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:52.180
So we have to start enforcing
for the protection of Nature

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:52.660
now.
 

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:55.529
And then the punch line was
this;

00:29:55.529 --> 00:29:57.599
and this was in a conference of
scientists.

00:29:57.599 --> 00:29:58.029
Okay?
 

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:00.558
"Scientists often claim
they need more money for

00:30:00.558 --> 00:30:03.430
research, and they'll accept it
if you make it available.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.823
Politicians can avoid
unpleasant decisions by saying

00:30:05.823 --> 00:30:07.558
that more research is
needed."

00:30:07.558 --> 00:30:10.433
So there's kind of a nice way
that they can help each other

00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:10.980
out here.
 

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:14.713
And, "The research must
not be used as an excuse for not

00:30:14.713 --> 00:30:15.710
taking action.
 

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:19.088
Because we already know this:
there are too many people.

00:30:19.088 --> 00:30:21.098
Some of them,
mostly in the developed world,

00:30:21.098 --> 00:30:23.015
consume too much,
and both conditions must

00:30:23.015 --> 00:30:23.808
change."
 

00:30:23.808 --> 00:30:28.965
So I was just simply trying to
state that, simply and

00:30:28.965 --> 00:30:30.950
straightforwardly.
 

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:34.537
The reactions were really kind
of interesting,

00:30:34.537 --> 00:30:38.682
and they also tell you
something about the history of

00:30:38.682 --> 00:30:39.558
Europe.
 

00:30:39.558 --> 00:30:42.148
So Norway, Germany,
Switzerland and England were

00:30:42.148 --> 00:30:44.903
for it, and France,
Italy, Portugal and Greece were

00:30:44.903 --> 00:30:45.730
against it.
 

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.929
The French delegate felt it
would play into the hands of the

00:30:48.929 --> 00:30:50.433
far right;
it would provide a

00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:52.568
justification for deportation of
immigrants;

00:30:52.568 --> 00:30:55.578
characterized my attitude as
eco-Nazi;

00:30:55.578 --> 00:30:57.710
and, as usual,
whenever the French are pushed

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.228
into a corner and they want to
pull out a trump card,

00:31:00.228 --> 00:31:02.019
a violation of the rights of
man.

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:03.140
Okay?
 

00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.088
Which they wrote.
 

00:31:07.088 --> 00:31:10.616
By the way, this French
delegate went on to become the

00:31:10.616 --> 00:31:12.680
environmental head of UNESCO.
 

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.640
So that was his attitude.
 

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:17.240
And the Norwegians,
who are a remarkably

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.108
self-satisfied and luxurious
people, felt that it didn't go

00:31:21.108 --> 00:31:22.109
far enough.
 

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:22.970
Okay?
 

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:27.470
So they wanted to see something
that was more revolutionary.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:29.319
The Germans thought it was a
good statement.

00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:31.779
The British felt it was okay.
 

00:31:31.779 --> 00:31:33.380
The Dutch liked it.
 

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:41.190
So I came away from that kind
of shocked,

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:45.789
but also realizing that
humanity is having great

00:31:45.789 --> 00:31:50.000
difficulty agreeing on its value
system,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.460
with regards to biodiversity.
 

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.579
And if we disagree,
we can't make much progress.

00:31:58.579 --> 00:31:59.680
Okay?
 

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.318
There's a lot of human value
systems.

00:32:03.318 --> 00:32:05.118
Some people think extinctions
are bad;

00:32:05.118 --> 00:32:07.679
just about anybody in this
department would,

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:11.309
because they love animals and
plants, and that's why they have

00:32:11.309 --> 00:32:12.680
chosen this career.
 

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:16.778
Some people might say that
extinctions aren't important,

00:32:16.778 --> 00:32:19.564
that really what we need to do
is have a healthy economy and

00:32:19.564 --> 00:32:21.500
save all the poor people in the
world,

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.950
and provide health care for
that, and forget about Nature;

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:26.269
you know, that's a secondary
priority.

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:29.339
And other people might say that
extinctions might even be good.

00:32:29.339 --> 00:32:30.970
You might wonder who that is.
 

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.853
Any person who owns private
property, on which an endangered

00:32:34.853 --> 00:32:38.472
species has been discovered,
is motivated by the current

00:32:38.472 --> 00:32:41.632
incentive structure of
U.S. Law to make sure that

00:32:41.632 --> 00:32:45.844
that species goes extinct before
the Federal Government finds out

00:32:45.844 --> 00:32:47.490
that it exists.
 

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.017
Because if the Federal
Government finds out that it

00:32:51.017 --> 00:32:55.107
exists, their property is open
to condemnation proceedings,

00:32:55.107 --> 00:32:56.588
and they lose it.
 

00:32:56.588 --> 00:33:00.807
So I have friends who are
ranchers in Hawaii who think

00:33:00.807 --> 00:33:02.318
exactly that way.
 

00:33:02.318 --> 00:33:05.430
So, because of this,
there are lots of conflicts;

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:10.190
we can't reach agreement and we
don't agree in that.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:12.450
So how do you change value
systems?

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.849
How do you get people to agree?
 

00:33:13.849 --> 00:33:15.690
How do you shift balance?
 

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:20.942
And I thought at that point
that it might be good just to

00:33:20.942 --> 00:33:26.474
show how people emotionally
react to the process of watching

00:33:26.474 --> 00:33:28.819
a species go extinct.
 

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:32.298
And Bev and I got together.
 

00:33:32.298 --> 00:33:36.400
And I had originally tried to
do this as a novel,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.155
and I discovered that my
ability to write convincing

00:33:39.155 --> 00:33:42.076
fiction had been totally
destroyed by twenty-five years

00:33:42.076 --> 00:33:43.858
of writing scientific papers.
 

00:33:43.858 --> 00:33:47.849
And so Bev, who's a journalist,
said, "Why don't we go and

00:33:47.849 --> 00:33:49.460
interview people?"
 

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.618
She's a journalist and she
knows how to interview people.

00:33:51.618 --> 00:33:54.740
And she's a remarkably
sympathetic personality.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:56.977
I'm kind of,
you know, big and have a white

00:33:56.977 --> 00:33:59.375
beard and whatnot,
but she's very sympathetic,

00:33:59.375 --> 00:34:02.039
and boy can she get information
out of people.

00:34:02.039 --> 00:34:04.538
And so we decided to try that.
 

00:34:04.538 --> 00:34:07.643
And our first interviews were
with Christophe and Hedwig

00:34:07.643 --> 00:34:11.085
Boesch about the chimpanzees in
the Ivory Coast that are going

00:34:11.085 --> 00:34:14.268
extinct,
and they were very deeply

00:34:14.268 --> 00:34:16.130
moving interviews.
 

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:17.599
We decided it was going to work.
 

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:18.880
So we wrote the book.
 

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.251
And I just want to take a
couple of examples out of the

00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:22.690
book.
 

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:29.170
This is the 'Alala,
the Hawaiian crow.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:33.559
And it was on the island of
Hawaii;

00:34:33.559 --> 00:34:36.760
when I was young,
you could occasionally see a

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.530
juvenile flying in the northern
part of the island.

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.755
By the time we started looking
into it, in the 1990s,

00:34:44.755 --> 00:34:47.679
there were only eleven crows
left;

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:50.159
they were down from 110 in the
wild.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:53.800
And they had disappeared from
every ranch, except the one

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.309
ranch whose owner kept the
biologists off the ranch.

00:34:57.309 --> 00:35:02.679
And basically what had been
going on is that the crows--this

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:07.686
is a skull of an 'Alala--the
crows had been encountering

00:35:07.686 --> 00:35:09.780
incompetent people.
 

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.775
And the take-home from that
particular chapter is that

00:35:12.775 --> 00:35:14.980
competent people are in short
supply.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.009
So in order to try to save
them, the biologists had taken

00:35:18.009 --> 00:35:20.929
more than a hundred eggs and
fledglings into captivity,

00:35:20.929 --> 00:35:25.789
and they'd killed all of them;
not one survived.

00:35:25.789 --> 00:35:30.349
And the owner of the ranch,
where they were still managing

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:32.514
to live,
Cynthia Salley,

00:35:32.514 --> 00:35:37.141
she decided that she wasn't
going to let anybody on the

00:35:37.141 --> 00:35:42.369
ranch who was not really
motivated to help save the crow,

00:35:42.369 --> 00:35:45.324
and so she told the biologists
that if they were going to work

00:35:45.324 --> 00:35:47.253
on her ranch,
they couldn't publish any of

00:35:47.253 --> 00:35:49.322
the results;
and that immediately stopped

00:35:49.322 --> 00:35:50.090
all activity.
 

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:50.949
&gt;
 

00:35:50.949 --> 00:35:54.027
So the biologists were
interested in their publications

00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:57.561
as much as, or perhaps a little
more than, they were interested

00:35:57.561 --> 00:35:58.530
in the crows.
 

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:05.800
And what happened--oh there was
a crazy incident.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:10.061
U.S. Fish &amp;
Game told Cynthia that she was

00:36:10.061 --> 00:36:14.610
in violation of the Endangered
Species Act,

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:16.590
and so in order to save the
crow--remember,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.402
they'd already killed a
hundred--they were going to come

00:36:19.402 --> 00:36:22.780
in with a helicopter and net the
remaining crows out of the air.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:26.023
Now they admitted that they
hadn't practiced on house

00:36:26.023 --> 00:36:26.710
sparrows.
 

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:27.320
Okay?
 

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.369
And there are only eleven of
this species left in the world.

00:36:29.369 --> 00:36:30.650
So the helicopters are going to
come in,

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.159
and a biologist,
hanging off the helicopter,

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:33.969
is going to net the crow out of
the air,

00:36:33.969 --> 00:36:36.949
because Cynthia wouldn't allow
them onto her property.

00:36:36.949 --> 00:36:40.842
Well at that point Cynthia
realized how crazy it was,

00:36:40.842 --> 00:36:45.409
and went to the governor and
got the governor to intervene.

00:36:45.409 --> 00:36:49.268
And a committee from the
National Academy of Sciences

00:36:49.268 --> 00:36:51.929
came out,
got the Peregrine Foundation

00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:55.146
involved from Idaho,
and some competent people

00:36:55.146 --> 00:36:59.309
reassured Cynthia that they
would be able to deal with the

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:00.260
situation.
 

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:03.800
So they took some of the
remaining crows into captivity

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:07.077
and established a captive
breeding program that now

00:37:07.077 --> 00:37:07.800
worked.
 

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.099
And in 1999,
in September,

00:37:10.099 --> 00:37:14.606
Bev and I went up,
and we saw the aviary where the

00:37:14.606 --> 00:37:17.090
baby crows were living.
 

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.744
And the last two--it was a
pair, a male and a female--the

00:37:20.744 --> 00:37:23.030
last two wild crows were
outside;

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.298
they were sitting up in a tree,
looking at the baby crows in

00:37:25.298 --> 00:37:25.800
the aviary.
 

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:31.860
Baby crows were making lots of
noise, as baby crows will,

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:36.730
and the adults had been drawn
to the noise.

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:42.920
Now it turns out that if you
are a baby crow,

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.829
and you don't have a wild
reared parent,

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:48.387
you don't have anybody to teach
you that you're supposed to shut

00:37:48.387 --> 00:37:49.969
up by 7:00 in the morning.
 

00:37:49.969 --> 00:37:53.543
And so every time they released
some of these captive reared

00:37:53.543 --> 00:37:55.420
crows,
they talked a lot,

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.710
and they got noticed,
and they got eaten by the rare

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:00.300
and endangered Hawaiian hawk.
 

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:01.760
&gt;
 

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:07.021
So there still are some captive
reared crows,

00:38:07.021 --> 00:38:10.610
but they can't release them.
 

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.480
And so essentially this species
now exists in captivity;

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:18.981
it doesn't exist in the wild
anymore, it's gone extinct in

00:38:18.981 --> 00:38:19.849
the wild.
 

00:38:19.849 --> 00:38:24.065
The next story has to do with
economic and demographic

00:38:24.065 --> 00:38:25.018
processes.
 

00:38:25.018 --> 00:38:27.079
And this is a story from
Chinese history.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.514
It was assembled by a Dutch
diplomat named van Gulik,

00:38:34.514 --> 00:38:39.184
who among other things wrote
some nice mystery novels set in

00:38:39.184 --> 00:38:41.480
China, set in Tang China.
 

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.670
And it's about white faced
gibbons.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:52.331
So the white faced gibbon
currently exists in Southern

00:38:52.331 --> 00:38:55.599
Vietnam and in Thailand.
 

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:58.590
At the beginning of written
Chinese history,

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.070
there were white faced gibbons
north of Beijing.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:05.369
So it over-wintered in the
mountains, in the snow,

00:39:05.369 --> 00:39:06.650
north of Beijing.
 

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.980
By the time of the Tang,
it had been--

00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:16.452
by the time the Tang fell,
so say roughly 900 or 1000

00:39:16.452 --> 00:39:18.197
A.D.,
had been pushed down to the

00:39:18.197 --> 00:39:20.375
Yangtze,
and then since then it had been

00:39:20.375 --> 00:39:21.929
pushed out of the country.
 

00:39:21.929 --> 00:39:27.320
And it was a very important
symbol in poetry and painting.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.780
The gibbon and the crane were
both symbols of longevity.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:35.273
When a Taoist saint got old,
he was supposed to turn into a

00:39:35.273 --> 00:39:37.518
gibbon and become immortal.
 

00:39:37.518 --> 00:39:40.719
The male gibbons have a very
haunting cry,

00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:45.074
and if you are a monk
meditating in a monastery on say

00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:48.867
the banks of the Yangtze Gorge,
you could hear,

00:39:48.867 --> 00:39:52.083
at 5:00 in the morning,
a gibbon fifteen kilometers

00:39:52.083 --> 00:39:54.329
away, giving out its territorial
cry,

00:39:54.329 --> 00:39:57.500
and for that it brought in all
of the magic and mystery of

00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.280
Nature into their imagination.
 

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:01.989
So it became an important
cultural object.

00:40:01.989 --> 00:40:07.675
Well, van Gulik made this map,
which basically--so this the

00:40:07.675 --> 00:40:12.599
Huang Ho, the Yellow River;
this is the Yangtze here.

00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:15.400
And it shows sightings of
gibbons, all labeled at

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.449
different times.
 

00:40:16.449 --> 00:40:21.672
And basically by the end of the
nineteenth century they'd been

00:40:21.672 --> 00:40:24.500
completely pushed out of China.
 

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:29.204
Now the interesting thing about
that is that in A.D.

00:40:29.204 --> 00:40:34.833
170, in the later Han Dynasty,
a group of policy wonks come to

00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:37.949
the emperor and say,
"Oh Emperor,

00:40:37.949 --> 00:40:41.199
the gibbon is going extinct,
and it's a terrible thing."

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:43.313
And the emperor says,
"Yes, it is a very

00:40:43.313 --> 00:40:45.860
important part of our culture,
we must preserve it.

00:40:45.860 --> 00:40:49.458
I authorize the army to stop
the peasants from cutting down

00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:50.699
the forests."
 

00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:53.000
That is what was causing the
gibbon to go extinct;

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.750
it was habitat destruction.
 

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.489
And the habitat destruction was
driven by demography.

00:40:59.489 --> 00:41:02.570
Poor farmers were having
babies, and they needed charcoal

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.550
to cook food to feed their
babies.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.068
So for a year or two the army
went out and protected the

00:41:09.068 --> 00:41:09.889
forests.
 

00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:12.998
But then there was a
revolution, the Han Dynasty

00:41:12.998 --> 00:41:16.570
fell, the central control
vanished, and the demographic

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:18.489
processes did not change.
 

00:41:18.489 --> 00:41:20.556
There were still poor farmers
having babies,

00:41:20.556 --> 00:41:22.577
and they still needed to feed
their babies,

00:41:22.577 --> 00:41:24.260
and they still wanted charcoal.
 

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:27.175
So basically the forests of
China got cut down,

00:41:27.175 --> 00:41:29.650
and the gibbon went extinct in
China.

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:32.050
And that happened nearly 2000
years ago.

00:41:35.599 --> 00:41:41.047
You might want to ask yourself
whether that might not still be

00:41:41.047 --> 00:41:42.030
going on.
 

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:47.041
Let's take a look at a more
recent case in a politically

00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:49.320
stable nation,
our own.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.369
And this has to do with the
Barton Springs Salamander.

00:41:53.369 --> 00:41:56.429
Barton Springs--how many people
here know Barton Springs;

00:41:56.429 --> 00:41:57.619
Austin, Texas.
 

00:41:57.619 --> 00:42:00.039
Have you swum in Barton Springs?
 

00:42:00.039 --> 00:42:00.699
Student:  Yeah.
 

00:42:00.699 --> 00:42:01.570
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:42:01.570 --> 00:42:03.710
Barton Springs--people in
Austin love Barton Springs;

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:05.661
nice steady temperature,
middle of a hot summer,

00:42:05.661 --> 00:42:06.659
jump into the springs.
 

00:42:06.659 --> 00:42:09.541
It's nice and cool,
clean water flowing out of the

00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:10.599
karst formation.
 

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:14.880
It's one of the big quality of
life issues in Austin.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.449
Okay?
 

00:42:15.449 --> 00:42:19.097
Well there's a little
salamander that lives in Barton

00:42:19.097 --> 00:42:21.786
Springs,
and it was used,

00:42:21.786 --> 00:42:25.942
together with the SOS,
or Save our Springs,

00:42:25.942 --> 00:42:29.659
Alliance, as a method of trying
to preserve the springs,

00:42:29.659 --> 00:42:32.349
and the area around it,
from development.

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:35.485
And the argument was with
Freeport-McMoRan,

00:42:35.485 --> 00:42:37.949
and the Texas Republican Party.
 

00:42:37.949 --> 00:42:41.385
Freeport-McMoRan is based in
Louisiana, and it's one of the

00:42:41.385 --> 00:42:43.460
world's largest mining
companies.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.389
It's a pretty cutthroat
enterprise.

00:42:45.389 --> 00:42:48.260
These people have employed the
Indonesian Army to put down

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:50.829
revolts in the western part- in
West Irian Jaya,

00:42:50.829 --> 00:42:54.498
the western part of New Guinea,
where they have big copper and

00:42:54.498 --> 00:42:55.280
gold mines.
 

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.679
And they play hardball.
 

00:42:58.679 --> 00:43:04.327
And they were behind a scheme
to put a city roughly the size

00:43:04.327 --> 00:43:09.599
of San Francisco next to Austin,
on the area out of which the

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:12.469
water drains,
to go into Barton Springs.

00:43:12.469 --> 00:43:14.527
And so the environmentalist
argument was,

00:43:14.527 --> 00:43:16.380
"We need to save the
springs;

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:19.824
therefore we can't have the
city, which is going to just

00:43:19.824 --> 00:43:22.768
completely destroy our quality
of life."

00:43:22.768 --> 00:43:26.036
And inside the springs there
are about twenty more endemic

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:28.025
species;
actually, they've now found

00:43:28.025 --> 00:43:30.280
another salamander in the
springs as well.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.646
However, the U.S. Endangered
Species Act doesn't allow you to

00:43:34.646 --> 00:43:38.865
use a legal argument to preserve
a species unless it's been

00:43:38.865 --> 00:43:39.739
named.
 

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:44.340
And so David Hillis,
in 1991 I think,

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:47.514
named the salamander and
described it officially in the

00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:50.690
scientific literature as
Eurycea s-o-s-orum,

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.949
for Save our Springs-orum.
 

00:43:52.949 --> 00:43:53.768
Right?
 

00:43:53.768 --> 00:43:56.320
And it's a cute little
salamander.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.559
Here it is.
 

00:43:57.559 --> 00:43:59.268
It's about two inches long.
 

00:43:59.268 --> 00:44:02.119
And I've been in the springs
and I've seen him.

00:44:02.119 --> 00:44:08.811
And the political response to
trying to get this species

00:44:08.811 --> 00:44:12.219
listed was really massive.
 

00:44:12.219 --> 00:44:15.545
So Kay Bailey-Hutchinson made
sure there weren't any listings

00:44:15.545 --> 00:44:16.489
in the whole U.S.
 

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:19.650
for a year, so that the
salamander wouldn't be listed.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:22.760
And Mark Kirkpatrick and his
then wife Barbara Mahler,

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.929
and Bill Bunch,
who's an environmental lawyer,

00:44:24.929 --> 00:44:27.329
they used the Endangered
Species Act,

00:44:27.329 --> 00:44:30.268
and finally they forced the
Secretary of Interior to list

00:44:30.268 --> 00:44:31.159
the salamander.
 

00:44:31.159 --> 00:44:33.106
It took four years,
and during that four-year

00:44:33.106 --> 00:44:35.849
period there were no species
listed in all of North America.

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:38.657
This one little salamander was
holding the whole thing up,

00:44:38.657 --> 00:44:39.940
for the whole continent.
 

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:43.710
So the development was blocked
temporarily.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.023
By the way, if the development
had gone through,

00:44:46.023 --> 00:44:48.090
it would have meant billions of
dollars.

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.780
It was big, big money.
 

00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:52.559
But this kind of conflict never
ends.

00:44:52.559 --> 00:44:56.050
We've been back in touch with
the people there recently.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.960
We're trying to update this
story a bit.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.690
They do have a successful
captive breeding program.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:07.739
They have been able to limit
the development somewhat.

00:45:07.739 --> 00:45:10.889
But the pressure is just not
going to go away.

00:45:10.889 --> 00:45:14.693
The only way that the
salamander will ever survive in

00:45:14.693 --> 00:45:19.085
the long-term is if committed
conservationists manage to stay

00:45:19.085 --> 00:45:19.889
active.
 

00:45:19.889 --> 00:45:25.539
Because the economic incentive
to develop is always there;

00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:29.190
it's not going to go away
either.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:31.179
So to summarize these different
points of view.

00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:34.010
If you just take the scientific
point of view.

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:37.135
There are some advantages in
some experiments that show

00:45:37.135 --> 00:45:40.072
biodiversity is a good thing,
but results are mixed,

00:45:40.072 --> 00:45:42.780
and if you just review all of
the biodiversity stuff,

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:46.237
on ecosystem function,
you have to come away honestly

00:45:46.237 --> 00:45:49.143
and say,
"Well, it's a mixed

00:45:49.143 --> 00:45:50.139
bag."
 

00:45:50.139 --> 00:45:55.159
The economic view is that the
services would be very costly to

00:45:55.159 --> 00:45:59.849
replace, but how they depend on
diversity is not clear;

00:45:59.849 --> 00:46:02.885
so that's because we don't know
the redundancy in the system and

00:46:02.885 --> 00:46:05.150
we don't know when we hit the
critical point.

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:09.744
The evolutionary view is that
all living things are related,

00:46:09.744 --> 00:46:13.559
but there isn't any natural
value in diversity.

00:46:13.559 --> 00:46:15.894
The evolutionary or purely
scientific point of view would

00:46:15.894 --> 00:46:17.480
be that there is no value in
Nature;

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.367
so, you know,
whether the planet's dead or

00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:21.440
alive actually doesn't make any
difference.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:27.260
If we then place a human value
on diversity,

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:29.940
for cultural reasons,
as we saw with the gibbons,

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.255
or in our own culture--every
one of you is probably sitting

00:46:33.255 --> 00:46:36.744
in this class because you had a
nice experience with some kind

00:46:36.744 --> 00:46:38.690
of biodiversity at some point.
 

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:44.878
Well basically what that does
is we are placing a human value

00:46:44.878 --> 00:46:48.400
on something,
and we've won the battle,

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:52.293
and now our value system,
which is our own homo sapiens

00:46:52.293 --> 00:46:54.750
value system of one kind or
another--

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.449
and you've seen there are
bunches of them--

00:46:56.449 --> 00:46:59.780
is being placed on the rest of
the planet.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.679
So some people spend to exploit
the planet;

00:47:01.679 --> 00:47:03.739
some people spend to conserve
it.

00:47:03.739 --> 00:47:08.170
So what is the origin and
justification of values?

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:12.887
This interesting case of the
biodiversity crisis causes us to

00:47:12.887 --> 00:47:16.820
confront that rather deep and
personal question.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:22.469
And when you encounter people
who are actively engaged in the

00:47:22.469 --> 00:47:26.800
conservation movement and
environmentalism,

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:30.248
I think you actually have to
ask, "Are the values that

00:47:30.248 --> 00:47:33.398
they're deploying really
something that is general and

00:47:33.398 --> 00:47:36.550
that you can derive for all
people at all times,

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:38.820
or is it simply an expression
of their personal taste?"

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:44.099
I happen to love orchids and
porpoises and so forth.

00:47:44.099 --> 00:47:48.449
Other people like to eat
porpoises.

00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.849
&gt;
 

00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:55.630
We're both human beings.
 

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.356
So if you want to read further
on this--actually the one that I

00:47:59.356 --> 00:48:02.722
really recommend that you read
is this book by E.H. Carr,

00:48:02.722 --> 00:48:06.329
on international relations
between the two World Wars.

00:48:06.329 --> 00:48:08.510
That's sort of a modern
Machiavelli,

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:11.858
or Thucydides,
that shows you how the nations

00:48:11.858 --> 00:48:15.815
of the world actually behave
when they are faced with

00:48:15.815 --> 00:48:21.887
decisions on deep matters;
they behave in a very,

00:48:21.887 --> 00:48:25.159
very hardball way.
 

00:48:25.159 --> 00:48:27.239
Okay, next time we go into
behavior.
